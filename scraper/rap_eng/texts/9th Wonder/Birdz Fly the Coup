[Intro: Phonte]
Uh, keep it goin' y'all. Are we goin' y'all? Check it out
It's Phontigga, from NC to Bucktown
Y'all niggas gon' Duck Down this is how we do it now yeah
For my nigga Buckshot. Yo, we better make history tonight man
It's my last night as a free man
She gonna motherfucking be here, In the motherfucking house
Tomorrow! (Alright, come on)

[Verse 1: Buckshot]
Ten o'clock on the dot, I
Make my way over to my girl's job by the shop
She in the wide body drop
All black
I didn't see her parked in the front so I say, "Fall back."
Called the cell, I heard, "Call back."
So I called back
Like a fool I heard more passion then laughing on the other side
Word to mother I'm...ppppsst
Word to mother I'm, not in the mood for the rude tactics
She think ahead then move backwards
Let me relax kid, cause
I don't wanna catch me a case
Even though I could just fetch in my waist
Stretch and embrace
Then place this nine in your face
I'm not
When I think about what I could have got I just stop and said
"Let me not get knocked by the cops"
So before you get shot by the shop
I play the block, cause

[Hook: Keisha Shontelle (Phonte)]
This is crazy, baby
But I just, adjust to all of the changes
(Gotta move, gotta grind with purpose)
(On my own thing dog)
(And y'all broads ain't worth it, come on)
This is crazy, baby
But I just, adjust to all of the changes
(Tryin' to keep control of the mic)
(No time for all you silly hoes in my life)
(That's how we do it)

[Verse 2: Phonte]
Oh what the heck
Let's get married and have a son named Dylan
No big deal, no sweat
No big meals and no checks
We was struggling, and...
I guess we just couldn't handle that type stress
So we went our separate ways
Game over like X-Box
No hard feelings baby, we gave it our best shot
So I hopped on a Boeing, and went back to touring
And figured, what the hell, I'll just go back to hoeing
It started with this first chick, I call her the R
Light skinned, looking like she should have been in DeBarge
Her tit-ties was monstrous
But had baby drama from another guy
Otherwise I wouldn't have squashed it
And then it was this stripper chick I met in the mall
Who used to send me instant messages from Dockside Dolls
But now I got a new broad, who rock my world too hard
And I'mma stop pimping, and her plane lands tomorrow, oh!

[Hook: Keisha Shontelle (Phonte)]
This is crazy, baby
But I just, adjust to all of the changes
(Gotta move, gotta grind with purpose)
(On my own thing dog)
(And y'all broads ain't worth it, come on)
This is crazy, baby
But I just, adjust to all of the changes
(Tryin' to keep control of the mic)
(No time for all you silly hoes in my life)
(That's how we do it)

[Verse 3: Buckshot]
Me and Phonte sippin' this Bombay
I introduce this chick as my fiance
Can I say?
She's sort of like Beyonce, beyond paid
She the boss, so she like to floss like she on stage
She a flirt though (What?)
You know, flirt a lot
Word Sha?
Go berserk though, you heard it word of mouth
I had to cut her off, I had to cut her loose
The only bird I'm rocking is a goose
Fly the coupe!

[Bridge: Keisha Shontelle]
You must be the man that I done heard about (What?)
It's Phonte and yeah I heard about the way you flirt around (Oh stop)
So can we work it out?

[Verse 4: Phonte]
Yeah, I know you heard about my lying and my gambling
Of hoes at the shows, all the tricking and philandering
But now I'm just chilling with my nigga named Buckshot
And for you girl, Help Is On The Way, like The Whatnauts
I must not break my discipline
Or wifey take me to divorce court, and have me back at the bus stop (Number 9!) Naw!

[Hook: Keisha Shontelle (Phonte)]
This is crazy, baby
But I just, adjust to all of the changes
(Gotta move, gotta grind with purpose)
(On my own thing dog)
(And y'all broads ain't worth it, come on)

But I just, adjust to all of the changes
(Tryin' to keep control of the mic)
(No time for all you silly hoes in my life)
(That's how we do it)

[Outro: Phonte]
You may find yourself, living in a one room apartment
On the other side of Larsville
And you may mind yourself, with a Dominican house, and a Dominican wife
And you will ask yourself, "Well, how did I get here?"
