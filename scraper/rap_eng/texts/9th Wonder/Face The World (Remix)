(INTRO)

Verse 1 (Sempel Ovechkin):
Yo fake it till you make it
What happens when you do
Friends turn to strangers
So im a stranger too
Thats trill shit
I been spitting this real shit
His Lyrics nice and they real slick
My flow Braille they gone feel this
Look
Dont cry tears they don't fly here
And if you don't shine here
Your gonna die here
Thats why 2014 already my year
Yellow nigga getting green my hustle John Deer
Dont test it
You can only respect it
Don't want to leave nobody breathless
Just to send you a message
My life is epic
But lately its been hectic
If i hold this pistol reckless
You no live another second
My team for the money and we Hung goo ree (Hungry)
My team Self Made thats word to Uncle Numpsey
Nigga i been making Hits off a bunch of loose leafs
A red lighter and some fire and a pack of loucies
Young niggas out here eating dog We leading y'all
Hit they hearts and get the streets involved
They talking stacks some copy cats
They really sweet and soft
Talking Crap they sound wack
With the beat and all
I don't even like to talk much
You "Boss" Cuz Talk rough
And get yo jaw stuck
Little snakes they super fake i disregard trust
These nigga hate what we create but it was all us
Anybody saw us know its all love
(Said its all Love)
(Bitch It was all us)
World on my dick so ima fuck her tip my balls Bust....... Mother fucker

(HOOK)

Verse 2 (Killa):
Fuck the fame I'm just trying to see a Mil
Got to get it for my son thats why i got to leave the field
And i ain't flexing I'm just trying to make a come up
And the field ain't no place for my young nigga to come up
17 but i gotta be the man now
Drugs done had my life i gotta come up with a plan now
Time to put the grams down
Its gotta be a better way
Then everyday out here pushing all this heavy weight
My momma say the only way is to graduate
Unless you trying to end up like your brother
Locked up for slanging dope to undercover
But I'm like mom its hard times and we in the struggle
And how we posed to get to this paper if i don't hustle
She told me the realest shit said boy just look at your brother
That all you need is your freedom as long as you got each other

(HOOK)
