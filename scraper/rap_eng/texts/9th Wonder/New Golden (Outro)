[Intro: Jay Rukas]

Lets try to one take this shit, for real
One time!
That Nas shit, like one time for your mind
Damn, big ups everyone who came through on this tape
Cooley Savant, Johnny Brooks, Limitless, Ice, Dexray Robinson
Cas Jay, Esco, Whizzer Dee
Shouts out to all of them for real, can't believe this shit came together

[Verse 1]

Check, it's the New Golden Era
About to cause terror to the whole mainstream area
Never, expect to get everything together
But it all came in tact like linear equations in math
Now I attack the raps
If they whack scraps, or go into the trash
Johnny mashed 'Mash', we all roll through like bandits wearing masks
Let's see how the people react
Our roster will be like Mortal Combat, with our fatal fatalities
Once we enter the facility, they'll be like "Ohhh they killed it, G!"
Soon to be on TV, but not trynna swim with the mainstream
Lemme get back to where it's at, on track
It hasn't even been and year, and I got my flow in gear
While y'all were drinking beers on the weekend
I speared the paper with the pen, and made a few friends
Music ignited a fuse that won't lose fuel
Microphones I leave bruised from verbal abuse
Y'all gonna use Rap Genius to get some clues
There's nothing new, except the people around you
They say, "Bring the people who you starved with!"
So I guess the Prospect Villains are eating all the food
I know they wishing me success
And some say, I could be one of the best
After this I ask the higher one, "What's next?"
Cause I know this ain't the end
It's the beginning of something never ending
It's the New Golden Era, it's the New Golden Era
