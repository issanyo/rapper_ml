(Verse 1: John Hendrixs)
Eternal sunshine radiant sun rays burn holes
In the blinds mind, bring enlightenment
For mentally enslaved erratic brain waves
Got'em ignorantly confined
I Drop Jewels, so thieves can easily find; so never mind trying
Steal what’s already yours
Follow Muhammad Gandhi
On contrary catch me on a Arabian horse
Galloping to Galilee waving a torch traveling
Challenging fallacy, battling malice that’s been order by
Kings cradled in their palace
Fuck the pharisees, can't judge if you too have sinned
They drink a lil gin hit the L, same lips sip from the chalice
Sit nice in my tie, tied to the service
Practice self discipline like teachings out in Shaolin
Through cataclysmic events I sought balance
Want more than applauds and exaltment off
Sound scans spins, I want freedom
Not god; but my indefinite strive into perfection
Won't never stop my incline to be him
As I soar with the sword of life fighting temptation
Abrupt whores disrupted the plight
Detoured my course yet time fears him
Write a memorandum random memoir
Lyrical jigsaw only intellectuals can ravel
Plant exotic fruits vegetarians dine on
Food for thought filled wit a lot of potassium
Disregard riding spinners rocking rhyme
Stones knapsack packed for survival
Jet pack charged fly towards Allah kingdom

[Verse 2: John Hendrixs]
As wind withers and tears turn to saw dust
Outsides warmer insides winter
Heart glazed over like tundra, I live near tombstones
Where corner blocks meet up
Fortified windows, forty fives, shots grazed water heaters unidentified, murders, revenge sweet we ignore high blood pressure
Devils pie they eat up
Pour liquor floods, let the dead clean up, no thanks
To FEMA, black clouds blot out every thought
On how you prosper, standing in the rain
Still(Steal) iron umbrella
A modern wielder mesh old and young together
Messiah speaking with a native tongue nelson Mandela
State try to mandate me, make me say stop rebelling
Not until the poor feel food in their bellies
And salaries rise like propellers, were leaders
Of the horror or ordained readers of the Torah
Chemical compounds illustrate nuclear light ups

(HOOK)
Chilling in the sunshine just let me be
