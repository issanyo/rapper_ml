[Intro: Phonte]
Zigga-zigga-zigga-zigga
Zigga-zigga...

[Median]
House the groove like shoes
Coldwell Banker or Shaq way back in LSU
We Jungle Brothers, so Justus with the fuzz
Hit 'em with the buzz for the close-up
Get 'em up, throw somethin in it, post-up

[Phonte]
New bread, new heat, nigga toast up
No such thing as 'Te without bars
That's like Pixar with no Cars
Or seein a dark-skinned DeBarge, Helter Skelter
I'm suited for the game, y'all dressed for failure
Hell...

[Phonte & Median]
I don't know else to tell ya!

[Median]
No sell like you peddilin shellfish
Selfish, so spolied and rot
Got money, I work hard for it
Far as pipin, it kinda take the pressure off a bit (Let 'em know)
I don't have to move digits, Losing My Religion
I don't have to do Twitter, consume and spew the iddish
But there's somethin in 'em, thaat says, "Go and get 'em"
Center 'em, show 'em you "The Sender"

[Phonte]
This is 308 style, 9th Wonder with the ow!
Peace to Kappa Lou, DeJeanne, Leroy McDowell
Blaow! North Hall was the centerpiece
Young bucks, baby killer bees
Before the days of the Twitter feed, we keep the beats bangin
Still swangin like Rebbie Jackson sangin 'bout a "Centipede"
One room studio, no amenities
Let me take ten to breathe

[Median]
Benny Dee's, mami ven aqui
Confortable visionary livin to extremes
Daddy Fat Sax, take two of these
James Flames, Median a.k.a. Mooey

[Phonte]
Two players in the same movie
Best buds in the same doobie
Ain't come for glory, show love to the ones before me
It's like the truth is overrated
You know the narrator's a fuckin liar, but you still love the story

[Median]
Describe anointing, what do you believe?
Faith is what we made it, the step is for the takin
Destined for the takers

[Phonte]
The movers and the shakers
Time is now, turn around, face it

[Hook: Phonte & Median]
The Earth spun around, the world dimmed out
Try to blame it on the sun like it went down
Where they reside, my heroes will forever live now
Horoscope was dead-on, couldn't live it down
There's no inventive incentive, we just deliver now
Bring the women out, what you spittin 'bout?
One thing's certainly I burn third degree
Somebody let 'em know we live eternally...

[Phonte]
... Like that y'all
Get at y'all, harass the track like a catcall
Tigallo a/k/a Hacksaw, Jim Thuggin
Flow so vivid, so fitted, nigga hats off

[Median]
When you get a minute, pass the ball
Where the pitch? Way past the wall
Fantastic family, they be like, "That's the jam"
Link up, smash the fans

[Phonte (Median)]
Thinkin of a master plan
All good like a cash advance
All bad like payin back a G when you only borrowed half a grand
Too interesting, heads up nigga
Get a leg up, probablyy still wouldn't stand a chance
This is fate, no happenstance
Say my mellow my man (Waddup?) My mellow my man (Waddup!)
Median, grab the mic and add on like an ampersand

[Median]
Life's a beach with ample sand, I'm at ease
I'm a travelling man, get a vista, a visa
Of you in a feature, what a fabulous glance
Scrambled a land, arrogant plan
Straight changin the face, makin a case but takin impatience

[Phonte (Median)]
Faith is what we made it, the step is for the takin
Destined for the takers (the movers and the shakers)

[Hook]

[Phonte:]
... My mans and 'nem
Nicolay, uh, that's my mans and 'nem
My nigga Zo!, uh, that's my mans and 'nem
And 9th Wonder, yo, that's my mans and 'nem
Median

[Outro: Phonte & Median]
Yo, that's my mans and 'nem
Young Khrysis, yo, that's my mans and 'nem
Kooley High, that's my mans and 'nem
Phonte
Hey, that's my mans and 'nem
Big K.R.I.T., yeah, that's my mans and 'nem
And Lil B, you know that's my mans and 'nem
DJ Premier, yeah that's my mans and 'nem
And King Mez, that's my mans and 'nem [fade]

[Affion Crockett over phone]
"The thing about relationships, that all men
Need to realize, cause I've had the problem, too
Of feeling guilty about this
The reality is men, we are always gonna wanna fuck other women
And a lotta times when you find a woman that is the woman of your dreams
And you love her and she's, she's all you EVER wanted in a woman
You're afraid to go forward with committing to her, and marrying her
Cause you really feel BAD about wanting to smash other women
It don't mean anything's wrong with your girl
She's still your great, find. But nigga, you ALWAYS gon' wanna smash somebody else."
