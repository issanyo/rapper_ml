[Verse One]
Little Brother opened doors and stayed on the road more
Stories circulated in all the magazines
I congratulated on the low turning green
Really low, the time of [?] video
And the A. Team had a little buzz
Man I stayed green, and caught a little grudge
Thought that everybody tried to shit on me
Then 9th called me and he flipped on me
On some bitch shit, I just told him I would fix it
I swallowed pride, spoke to Boog and Khrysis; apologized
Never Personal
Like that EPMD shit, Leg will work for you
It's hard to be me shit
My attitude and ego made me forget who's my people
Amnesia
No smoke, couldn't blame the reefer
Now I remember
I could see self in the center

[Hook] {x2}
E True Story, do you believe? True story
Shit you don't know, the shit they won't show
All about shine, L will ride for this shit
It's about time I tell my side of the shit

[Verse Two]
About the time, of the basement show
About the time, I grew tired of playing low
Wanted to speak on everything and be on everything
Maybe I was tripping
'Bout the time Steph got out of prison
He beat his time, we'll meet when it's time
Then the plot of the movie changed, I got a DUI'y
I crossed a lane, coming back from Scott [?]
Win or losing, whatever, keep it moving
So called can it be, my so-called family, deceiving on me
And talking negative
They sleeping on me
And taking sedatives
Speak when I'm not around, when I'm there, not a sound
You know who you are, can't hold a rock star
It seems ill
'Bout the time we took Greenville
I lived it up
All that rah rah yeah
That chick on your nuts? Ha ha yeah

[Hook]

[Verse Three]
The king of NC stayed real on the throne
About the time K. Hill made moves on his own
That's my nigga
Coalition at it again
Smash on niggas
Running with gat again
Plus, me and Dunny back at it
What? Let's get some money while we at it
Stack up
Let's get some plaques up
Start living
'Bout the time Median was missing
I understand there, scream at me when you get back
I'll get at you while Dho was making business moves
Things are real, Fat Beats did the single deal
Let's do it
About the time of Legsclusives
Amoeba reneged, so we hit the streets with it
Got M.I.A. with Kazi and M.I.A
About the time, that I was caught up
It was was about the time, nothing could stop us
