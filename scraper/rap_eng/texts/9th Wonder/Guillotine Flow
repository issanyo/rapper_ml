[Hook: Big K.R.I.T.]
You geekin’ huh? You geekin’ huh?
You geekin’ huh? You geekin’ huh?
Eh nigga this that guillotine flow
I’mma cut them niggas down, shorty, anything goes
Wasn't none of them niggas around, shorty
Now I’m on my king shit, C.R.E.A.M. shit
Eagle wing shit, bubble a high beam shit
Give ‘em that dope that fiends get

[Verse 1: Big K.R.I.T.]
5 star flow, been a while since I done bossed up
Round table talkin’ I’m seasoned so put the salt up
Get crossed up, I’m Crawford, you awful, give the ball up
We all in, no fallen’, from that platform, got tossed up
Like [sit here?] don’t worry about these others
If I let you push that foreign with fins that mean I love you
Put that shit to heart, played my part, 'til my closet's Noah’s ark
Gator toes, fox and furs, matching belt, life is hard
So I hit the strip money making KRIT
Used to bang for a block, now I’m on my acre shit
40 and a mule, anything else minuscule
I ain’t asking for your plate, I just wanna be full

[Hook: Big K.R.I.T.]
Shorty cause this that guillotine flow
I’mma cut them niggas down shorty, anything goes
Wasn't none of them niggas around, shorty
Now I’m on my king shit, C.R.E.A.M. shit
Eagle wing shit, bubble a high beam shit
Give ‘em that dope that fiends get
You geekin’ huh? You geekin’ huh?
You geekin’ huh? Yea you geekin’ huh?

[Verse 2: Big K.R.I.T.]
Serve it like some hubbers on the corners
To them geekers and them freakers and them stoners
That fiend for that very moment
Brakes were screeching like sneakers but the speakers
Was beating so loud nobody could peep it
They double back like “what you sold me?”
This shit here OG for the low-low, I can’t go forth without
Paying you more though cause I’m oh-oh-oh-oh-oh so high
That’s what I hear a lot but my product is real rock
Nirvana with the ear throb, if you need more you should try
Never stepped on upper echelon with the fire
Now run along, keep the line moving
Cause there’s more folks that wanna buy
And we got that, never sold out, can’t hold back supply
Unless you searching for that wack shit, I ain’t that type of guy

[Hook: Big K.R.I.T.]
Shorty cause this that guillotine flow
I’mma cut them niggas down shorty, anything goes
Wasn't none of them niggas around, shorty
Now I’m on my king shit, C.R.E.A.M. shit
Eagle wing shit, bubble a high beam shit
Give ‘em that dope that fiends get
You geekin’ huh? You geekin’ huh?
You geekin’ huh? Yea you geekin’ huh?

[Verse 3: Rapsody]
Rapsody, show me off like a trophy
Five finger rap a nigga but now I’m Kobe
I been lying low key but niggas been in the media
I know your life story without looking up Wikipedia
It costs a lot to be famous
Words don’t break bones but that don’t mean they ain’t painless
Steel sharpen steel but I don’t know if it’s stainless
Conversations with the older guys laying the game thick
Came in the game like Jameis on some fucker shit
Niggas ain't immortal, but living like fuck a bucket list
Became famous, get money, spend it on rubber tits
The real niggas I know all respectin’ the real shit
That’s the media, mama ain’t raise an idiot
Hollered at the Doc and my niggas is like “is you kidding me?”
Yea, game respect game, just promise when the fame come nigga, you won’t ever change
I’m in this Cam’ron pink, I look good in these streets don’t I?
Niggas talk shit like a nigga won’t pull up on ‘em
You know where I be, talkin’ Common rappin’ bout corners
I’m the black storm trooper all the whites folks mad at
Don’t like female rappers? You only mad you can’t bag that
Fuck you and your homeboy, security got ‘em
You want a rebound you better holler at Rodman
Need a dentist for that bullshit you talkin’ homie
You know I keep a new flow if you feelin’ tender on it
Hotline bling and ain’t nobody answering your calls
How meek of you niggas not to answer me at all, I feel a way
But the album comin’ so I’ll save it for another day
Calling me Rapsody, ain’t no Tigger though
Shouts to my left coast niggas out on Figueroa
To make it spark I ain’t need a trigger or a milli yo
All I ever needed was a trill guillotine flow

[Hook: Rapsody]
Shorty cause this that guillotine flow
I’mma cut them niggas down shorty, anything goes
Wasn't none of them niggas around, shorty
Shorty now I’m on my queen shit, C.R.E.A.M. shit
Eagle wing shit, bubble a high beam shit
Give ‘em that dope that fiends get
You geekin’ huh? You geekin’ huh?
You geekin’ huh? You geekin’ huh?
