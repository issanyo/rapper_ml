[Verse 1: Bishop Lamont]
I don't know if they done told you but bitch I'm a boss
Push a big black truck with the duel exhaust
Stash spot for the haters if our paths ever cross
Beef get expensive, your life is what it costs
But fuck the negative, I'm lookin' for freaks to toss
With head so vicious, ass like Tracey Ellis Ross
So I switch to the Beamer, it's time to floss
Like a bitch that'll swallow like it's applesauce
But if you don't cool, off your chin, let it drool
You gotta doggy style, that's my only one rule
I like to watch the ass
Maybe slap the ass
Kiss it, freaky shit, even bite the ass
Rough nigga, snatch your hair when I stroke ya
Elbow in your back, don't be scared if I choke ya
This that monster fuck, spin you round pick you up
Bet your man don't fuck like this, step your game up

[Hook: Bokie]
(I just want the money)
Can't pay my rent with a relationship
(Simps just want the honey)
Go bankrupt just so they can bust a bitch
(You won't get one cent from me)
Not a dime, not a nickle or a penny
(Bite your nails if you get hungry)
Ummm hmmm

[Verse 2: Bishop Lamont]
Yaararaaah
Donkey Kong with the ding dong
Sex powers like China with the ping pong
Dick long as a Chop & Screw slow song
I'm kinda well endowed
Is that so wrong?
I can't help it, I'm a cocky nigga
Literally, figuratively
When it stiff it look like Italy
Oui, oui, it's the Eiffel Tower
Make the sliddin' doors shake when we crush in the shower
I love the neo-soul bitches
Head wrap, vegan, jazz, spoken word bitches
They be actin' so pure and mannerable
Get 'em home them bitches turn to animals
Get my dick sucked to Trek Life to Little Brother
Jill Scott, get 'em hot, quick to fuck a brother
They all the same when they take off they clothes
A hood rat to college girl, I love deez hoes

[Hook: Bokie]

[Verse 3: Bishop Lamont]
I never been a trick
And never will
My dick is expensive
You pay for the motel
You pay for the hotel
Then you pay me
Cause it's so swell
When it comes to simpin'
I don't play around
These niggas Halloween
Trick Or Treatin' all year round
Not scared for 'em
Been misinformed
Only treat 'em like that if it's wifey on your arm
Shit
And even that's debatable
I see niggas buyin' bitches like these hoes inflatable
I could never be a lifeguard, I'll never save a ho
I treat a bitch like dad, I just say, "No"
I'm not a pimp, I just sound like one
I'm not a player I just hand around some
I'm not greedy but you can't have a crumb
You're lucky air is free cause I wouldn't give you none

[Hook: Bokie]

[Outro]
Shouts out to Khrysis. Khrysis got beats too. All my niggas in North Carolina
Justus League and shit. That's what's up. Let's keep it rollin' niggas
Let's go to church real quick on these motherfuckers real quick man
Spit the gospel you know? Shit knock
