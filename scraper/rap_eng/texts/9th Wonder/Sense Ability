[Intro: Charles Hamilton]
Yeah... Yeahhh
Since you decided to play this song
It's only right that I let you know that I'm floating in the room as your listening. (chea')
In the room that you're listening to this in. (heh-haha)

[Verse 1: Charles Hamilton]
Just get high from the melody
Feel the vibe of the melody
I got you feeling heavenly
Like you're all high off LSD
And this is a hullucination
And this is a new situation
You ain't never heard a drug in your ear
So I guess this will be the drug of the year
This that Cali Piff, mixed wit' a little bit of balance
It's that, EQ Guy, GQ Guy
He's too High
I see you I
Am all up in your mind right now
And ya' high right now
And you're blind right now
And I just keep moving from left to right as I pan, damn, who am I?

[Hook: Charles Hamilton]
I'm ya' sense ability
I'm ya' sense ability
And you lost me
And you lost me

I'm ya' sense ability
I'm ya' sense ability
And I lost you
Got no one to talk to

I'm ya' sense ability
I'm, sense ability

[Verse 2: Show TuFli]
I wrote this song when I'm not high
Because I probally would've died if I got high
But I think it's about time that I got high
I need Weed and Henny and Popeyes
That'd keep me satisfied
Nah fuck it
I don't even have to lie
I need about 10 freaks that's down to ride
That'd do freaky things no alibi
That'd lick me like a lolli, lolli pop
Keep going lil mamma I ain't tryna' stop
Hit the blunt again
You ain't high as I
Some where past Mars is where I reside
I got a star for pillow
Come fuck wit' a hero
Is it my ego, that got me so
No habla ingle'
So much fly shit he say, press replay
How fly do you want me to get?
How high do you want me to get?
Flow drugs
No wonder when I spit I get hungry as shit (heh-ha)
And everybody want me to spit

[Hook: Charles Hamilton]
I'm ya' sense ability
I'm ya' sense ability
And you lost me
And you lost me

I'm ya' sense ability
I'm ya' sense ability
And I lost you
Got no one to talk to

Ytiliba esnes 'ay m'I
I'm, sense ability
I'm, sense ability
I-I-I-I'm, sense ability
I-I'm, sense ability
I-I'm I'm, sense ability

And you lost me
And you lost me
And I lost you
Got no one to talk to
