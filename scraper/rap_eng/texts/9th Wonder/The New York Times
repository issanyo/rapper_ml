It's alright

LIVE FROM DA T.R.A.P.!
It's the new york times!

Theirs a war going on outside no man escape from
Live every day like you can't waste none
I've been struggling to success but patient
Affiliated with thugs and thug occasions
Real tight niche, like warehouse location
Skank dollar scene remote like vacations
Islands to be specific
My luck be a lady some nights
Like south pacific
Fiends light the ring of fire
Girl jumps through it (Crack)
S the darker side of black music
Dope boys get hype to it
Police loose it
Like we stuck up in a program
It's like going to prom dancing to slow jams
How I'm gonna to ball
I was a teenaged adult
Flipping work like shit came with vaults
Try me, i dropped a lot of girl on balance beams
Push rocks like I'm on transformer team
Skank Two,Surf esponyola yola
With more house hold uses for baking soda
Flow uglier than crack smokers
Bonafide souljah
Ricki lake couldn't make me over (over)
I done came up seeing my brothers mistakes
Made em all right when i focused on weight
History repeats it self in that case
I'm on the road to riches, like G rap in 88
Flow sharp, use this to scrape yo plate
Scarface and bushwick bill mad like fuck jakes
Resurrecting skank dollar sculptures now that's art
Hey put em on ya hot block, heyyy that's heart

[Break]
C'mon man get off me!

Now lets get this straight

[Verse 2:Skank]
Skank a slut name but far from desperate (BARRET)
In the search of paper how far you go for it (Fore)
I get thick like a bowl of porridge
Syrup, move like a corporate
But he mad corrupt
Threat this rap shit
Like crack shit
Because i passed it
Few goals in this
Like a ha-trick
Power plays, police block like mike Richter
Like Big L i see the big picture
Earn figures
Play a fool to catch one
Learn niggas
Deep Like Big worm
Loyalty earns niggas
Running on love
In the pursuit of happiness
I sold drugs
It wasn't enough to cop a truck
Yeah, child of the ghetto i rely on my instincts
Mild mannered fellow,like Clark Kent doing business
Tryna come up using words as a benefactor
In the hood its like fear factor
Boxed in like compactors
If your running new york? then nigga run faster
I'm the answer
Out to cop pear handles and diamond daggers
Watch me make it out of the slave shift, no masters
Niggas softer than Duroc, plaster
Flow sicker than custos, fiends,cancer
Memoirs of a goon,dope boy chapters
Child of the ghetto,laundromat pastures
Back to the future
What he came back for?

[Break]
The Money

OH God

Live From da T.R.A.P
Play This In Ya Truck
Take The 95 (RELOAD!)

[Verse 3:Skank]
On tracks in riding,no pit crew
Fiends love my dope
Watch it bling, mad crystals
Flashback, you could catch me by Club Crystals
Looking like Apache chief letting the money grow
Me an my nigga cut scene like Casino
My mans tryna build up a team like Nino's
I keep a lil fish in the water,Nemo
Grab Some Honey Buns By the corner store,RELOAD
Papi, i need 6,How much much chu got? Pokito
Fuck you always short for? model turned custo
Crackhead, bet she could swallow a coke bottle (nah I'm good)
Money on my mind so i started with a young ho
13 going on 33, from shit she seen before
TÃ­malo, two letters no youth, but he look it though
If i catch a charge I'm coming back when they get old
No digital g's, my brothers eyes celestial
