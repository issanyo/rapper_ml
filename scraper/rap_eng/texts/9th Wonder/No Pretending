[Intro: Raekwon]
Yeah, yeah you already know man, for real man
From the projects man, all the way to motherfucking
The other side of the world, and shit
You know, 9th Wonder on the track
Big, big boy style, you already know
Louis Rich man

[Verse 1: Raekwon]
From the Benz to Impalas, a fistful of cash
A bank account, mad thick, quick to hem you, and blast
Instead of maxing in the winter, I'm in Japan with my kin
Hydro spraying a blunt, while Duke do the glasses
It's evident we're comical, quick to
Change up the slang, and bring the beef to you
Just like McDonald's do
Fronting raw, sit behind the bulletproof wall
Count my money, go to war, pull out while fucking my brawd
I'm no industry nigga that suck dick, I only write checks
Get out of line I'm striking the WIC, pull a viper out
Stunting on the beaches, ocean pacific gear
........run the world with my girl it's like sex and the city
Double Aston, rub my dick, fuck with my titties
Yo bitches that love you, that's wonderful, what it do now?
But don't pretend it don't look comfortable

[Bridge x4]
But don't pretend it dont look comfortable

[Sample Hook by 9th Wonder]

[Verse 2: Raekwon]
Ay yo back to blowing holes in the microphone pole
I do it easy, with 41 years of my soul
I run around high, and use it like a lullaby
Gone with the wind, with Asics on my feet you can smell the Glock
Cousin stay buzzing, from here to Toronto
Then from there to Buenos Aires, sunk in the congo
All kind of colorful brims,trend big, what it do, yeah
You got money? You welcome to share....keep change
Dwell on recollection, reflections for days
And slanging gats in the buildings for sections
Swim through money like I'm Jewish
Cruising around salt waters, flows don't blow through no sewers
You hungry? Hit me on the hip. You smell me?
Fake niggas sitting on my whip you tell me?
And I got it premiere, stay winning
Respectable real,rugby rap on the low no pretending

[Bridge x3]
Rugby rap on the low, no pretending

[Verse 3: Big Remo]
Call me Breezy, short for Big Remo
Call up a breezy, tell her to send 3 more
As in kilos, pies be gambinos
Auto-pilot im on grind, no sleep mode
Auto signing, no diamond....wood piece on
Dezzy underneath arm, in case I gotta beast on em'
You soft like a threechon....Pussy get beat on
Cherry street fairy around the way, I'm legendary nigga
Ask around the three-four...
I run with the billas, dealers, killas, lamas, gorillas, pretenders
Fake niggas you ain't get the memo?
Try to form an alliance with the lion out of Carolina
I can speak for em', the jays that I unleash on em'
And they don't capeesh, they hem'd up to see
So I respect the street, it's not a game or for thing shit
Im a star, linin' with Gods, Im shining..It's hard
