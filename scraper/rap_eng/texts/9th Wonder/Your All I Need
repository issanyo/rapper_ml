[Verse 1: Hannah]
I want that legendary money counting Al Green
Wake up in the morning to smooth jams from Kweli
Motivation from boom baps and drum claps
OGs on the porch be sipping that cognac
I was only thirteen when I began rapping
That’s when my brother picked up a gun and started trapping
Gang bangers base heads were living in the projects
The government's project, I know it’s more than logic
They put us in the hood, we're similar to engines
Rat race, we're looking for cheese and the vengeance
It’s the kill off, when gun shots pill off
I know some killers that will come and pop your whole lid off
Culture, the black community is where it started
Now we're living the life of hip hop stories
Now the talk is who’s wearing Balmain jeans Versace shades
Two chains, I wonder why the game changed cause you changed

[Hook: Hannah & Hershey] x2
Until the end I’m fighting here with my friend
Or maybe it’s with a lover or maybe cousin of kin
I’m down if you're down for me
The world wants to battle it's cool cause you're all I need

[Verse 2: Hershey]
Thoughts of troubled youth that's surely headed to the coffin
So creative, no mama she couldn't see that often
Cause she's busy working jobs she hates
But she does it to put food on the table
And clothes on your ass , now you all in school like you don't know how to act
Walk to the back, classmate tries to pull it cause you had a pair of Rocawear
Came up out ya ones and had him imitating rocking chairs
She say she wants a real nigga, get rich quick fix
Met him at the pick up stix, now u know she moving bricks
Gentlemen won't suit her , cooler than a cooler
Niggas wish they knew her , finessing all pursuers
Money making, chance taking, grew up in the hood
All I had was the fam and the homies like the wood
Drug addicts, bandos was the only scenery
So I understand if you ever are in need of me

[Hook] x2
