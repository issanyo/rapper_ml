[Intro]
Yeh... Notion ... Movement Fam
You know we some masterminds right..
Absolutely baby...
Come on... catch up!

[Verse]
Now muhhfuckas, watch out, coz you messin' wit some masterminds
The pessimist's are always last to find, the path to life
The deficit is, if your in much debt, alright
Well that don’t mean you can't shift your mind, lift your spirits tonite
Coz, we prepared, we chill on the upper ledge
Im fuckin' wit heads, with shit, they wish, I never said
But your, only as good in your mind, as your last design
That’s why I'm, uppin my steez, & blastin every rhyme
Thru the difficult times, I struggle, then I strive thru
Strength is the leader of me, im never walkin' blind dude
Even know I try to, stay on top of things
Im keen to see what my options bring, coz I got lotsa dreams
I pluck a thought, or a feelin, & I manifest it
Visualizin' is a brilliant way to express it
Just let the world know, where you wann' go
& attraction will take you, yo, so prepare for the road
Growin' older & wiser, being surrounded by the positive
Im at the focal point of where the knowledge is, im talkin about a... Mastermind...

You ain't born wit it, you make it
Stay positive, there's no way to mistake
A "Mastermind"
Nope, no one here can mistake it, set the code, yo, we probably break it, a "Mastermind"

& I'll script it to the very end
Every flick of the pen, every stroke of the key
Is openin' me
To get the mix of this very blend, right
Hope transcends tight, through ya cones
Speakers and tweeters, in ya home, nice
Feel the grown type, of
Ingenuity, the spirit flowin' fluidly
While yall frownin' stupidly, it, ain't nuttin' new to me
But, seriously, if you are only just hearin' me
First time, I thank 9th for settin' the scenery
&, pavin' the way, for me to open my dome piece
Chop and arrange a sample in a way to control me
Im, so high and there's no trees
Its like this shit is so easy, but its no breeze
Im incognito when, & how I doose mine
In the zone so much, no wonder how I lose time
Learn from 9th online, at Duke Live, now im some kind a...

[HooK]
"Mastermind" yup
You ain't born wit it, you make it
Stay positive, there's no way to mistake, A "Mastermind"
Nope, no one here can mistake it
