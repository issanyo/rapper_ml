Yeah

Yeah
Rap Culture Uno
Yo, the Mixtape

Yeah
Let's do this
Yo

Verse 1
Men, I can't believe what we listen to, nowadays non medicinal trash to just imprison you
My Soul criers like it's a downpour, Cos the quality on the Mic is down poor just like the ground floor
The sound blur to your eardrum boy you can just hear some dumb lyric, on point like it's some gimmick
Yo, this nursery rhyme school of thought is all a bluff, noisemakers, voicequakers, here lying to obstruct, the truth hommie
All this mumbling uhmm, grumbling dumb looking scarecrow with ugly gum cooking hair though
What scares bro, is they sound worse than a drunk man singing he doesn't care yo
I care though that is why am here bro, spitting lines to design poetry like Edgar Allen Poe
Am not bragging but on the Mic clever I'm drop
God's Grace is the reason I forever hope

Chorus


When we wanna hear Substance
But what they feeding us is nonsense
Mumble Rap/

And the People take a dumb stance/
That's because we got no conscience/
All a Trap/

What we think is having more fans/
Recycle words like Circumference/
Double Wack/

No Knowledge No Importance/
Just Money in abundance/
So MUmBlE cRaP/


Verse 2
Listen to the similes & the metaphors/
The multisyllables silly means to better worlds/
Punchlines Poetry in between with clever words/
Abstract minded Lyricism like spitting letter 4s/
Vivid imagery storyline picturing/
The soul of streets we live with no fiction in/
We talking about Science & it's appliance/
Not all this talk of highness & truth defiance/
Yo, The people are now victims of the sinful/
It's simple cos most mumblers re pure nymphos/
Drug addicts, sex maniacs, we all at ease/
With the nonsense turning us to thugs at least/
Am from the Era where Rhymes were Case Studies/
We face buddies/
On a Cypher erase funnies/
It's a shame that music is in a mess age/
Where there's no message/
Words from the sense sage/


Chorus

When we wanna hear Substance
But what they feeding us is nonsense
Mumble Rap/

And the People take a dumb stance/
That's because we got no conscience/
All a Trap/

What we think is having more fans/
Recycle words like Circumference/
Double Wack/

No Knowledge No Importance/
Just Money in abundance/
So MUmBlE cRaP/
