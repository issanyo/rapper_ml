[Verse 1: Monsta KiD]

On my part 2 shit
This is for the fuck of it
Let's sit back
Matter fact fall back
I'm done with bullshit rap
Once a kid that gave a fuck
Then I met the trap
Became friends with
A marijuana sack
Running around waste
Away my seed
Get hype and jiggy
I rhyme with heat
Yo bitch in heat
She got a taste
For Jimmy Dean
Rubbing up on my meat
The illest nigga you
Can not defeat
The truth how dare
I speak
I fucked around and
Got up on my two feet
10 toes down
Knuckles up you
Cluster fucks
Me against the world
Matter fact it's y'all against
The CLAN
Black towel heads
Black Taliban's
I just might just
Switch a flip
And lose my shit
Back hand a nigga
If he thinks I a bitch
My mind on grip
My mind and I
Who controls this gift
Niggas telling
Now niggas bailing
Shark week how
The bullet holes
End a sentence
With a period
Add exclamation
Just so you know I'm serious
Bless these lyricals
That touches souls
Hence forth I'm
The reason niggas
Loading bowls
Standing out loud
Like trombones
Just so you know
It's all been said
Through the headphones

[Verse 2: Monsta KiD]
Can't help but
To feel original
Quite common
Like penitentiary and ramen
Sick of all the bullshit
Why they gotta buy it
Why I understand the game
From the fibers to the science
Refer me to your highness
I be smoking everyday
I'm into pov's
Like a gynecology
In a mood
I adjust
Right now
My eyes look shut
Thinking about how
I started up
Now coming up
A man who stop giving
A fuck
No love lost
For so and so
And such and such
Your opinions can
Eat an uppercut
So pack a lunch
God I miss you Forrest
You was the bear
That fed me truth
And pourage
Mid class life
We'd be poor
And rich
Now I'm growns and shit
I'm a hold it down
Til the day it's
Me and my bitch
(I'm a hold it down)

[Verse 3: Monsta KiD]
I promise to give
Her many life
Intentions of love
And staying high
Ride by my side
Til death do us
Part and die
I sense the days
I grow wise at
A single young age
All he ever wanted
Was his granny straight
Now it's time that he
Gets his pay
Then make his place
As he cements his name
And dripping of tears
Of felt success and accomplishment
No longer holding back
My mind off safety
My mind on gravy
This is the part
Where they start to hate me
I dreamed I shitted
On niggas and woke
Up from a toilet
With a stack
Of tissue
That help solve
My issues
Can't help
But to feel like Broly
The flow is overflowing
Those gestures are made
But these jesters
Aren't getting paid
Don't you dare
Sleep on me
Or take a fucken nap
You must grow patience
And be surprised
When I exhibit greatness
No matter the
Stronger I get
I'm bench pressing
The 626
Moving the loud
No volume adjustments
I hope they hear
This before I
Face God and judgement
(Forgive me for my sins)
