[Intro]
Aw man
Yeah...
Let's get it...
Wealthy Gang up in this...
Whoa
Whoa
Whoa...

[Verse]
Now I remember sitting at the table, no food on my plate
Since adolescence, the kid had to go out and strive for his steak
I had to...
Become too sweet, I had to grind for the cake
I had to find myself, then search for who could relate
And damn...
I guess my kind too rare
I guess not searching for the fakes, made my life more real
January 12th dawg, yo that stacked morale
I'm talking so for real
I'm talking that they knew since back on Birwood
I was finna kill every rapper till my pain heals
Nah I'm playing this forever murder
You and them bullets, that's forever merger
And I ain't siking like Wanda
And if they drag me to the court you better lie after your honor
I'm so for real
I could put you 6 feet under oath dawg
With 6 feet
That's me, J, and Kinz
Stomp you out with the same kicks that dropped this week
(Aye yo, you see them tens dawg?)
But don't fret
Im really not a trouble maker
Unless you making trouble
Really ain't a dog, unless you...
Unhook the muzzle
But to be honest it just stay hooked
I mean it
I never really talk to girls, if you believe it
I swear...
Since 99' ain't ever had a girl hop on my genius
And if you even think she ever snuck a peek at my ginormous demons
You thinking wrong
Wait...
I said you thinking wrong
Them two don't make a right
But that's fine
I bring the light
Aye yo pops watch yo son shine
I'm still mourning, it's gonna be alright
Shit
At least I'm over night
At least I gotta Glo in the sky to keep me bright
Yo...
Mark my words like a typo
I'm finna catch them dreams like a sleepy headed psycho
But I can't sleep
Stab the sheep
Stay woke
I gotta be the GOAT
I gotta find my hope
Man this ain't no joke
Cause the devil at my crew neck
Threw him over my shoulder, then hit him with a suplex
Nigga who next?
No reply, cause I got it
They running after the prophet
While I'm after the profit
And oh Lord...
You think you ill?
Check the birthdate you ain't the God...
And that's real....

[Outro]
Are you feeling me?
Man this reminiscing killing me...
January 12th
99' 'til infinity...
Yo, yo...
Are you feeling me?
Man this reminiscing killing me...
Yeah this reminiscing killing me
January 12th...
99' 'til infinity...
Nigga...
