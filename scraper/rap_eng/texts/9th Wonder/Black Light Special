Black light onnn..

[Hook]
(*whispers* Turn it...turn it...turn it..)
Turn that bright light off, that black light onnn..
(*whispers* Turn it...turn it...turn it..)
Turn that bright light off, that black light onnn..

[Rapper Big Pooh]
I got the mic by firm grip, niggas ain't heard shit
Word to Mike Burvick, Tommy's on the move
I ooze witta, grooves witta, soothes witta who-hitter
Aw, you ain't heard, my nig? That's old news
Poobie writes the blues like, Sally on the tube like
Miles kinda Blue like, "Fuck it, we break rules"
I choose what I want to, dos what I want to
You, you just a front, dude, you better move!
We head back to demonstrate, bass lines penetrate
"Sleepers" got you awake, sheeeit, I got a crew!
All the J's stand up, bitch niggas squat down
Number one ass frowner sticks like GLUE!
I stick like WHO? Fraiser in his prime
I'm a beast wit the rhyme, art-iste witta line
And seize when you find, Poobie and Wonder 9
I'm say it to you one more time - I'm A BEAST

[Hook]

[Rapper Big Pooh]
I'm a beast - I'll say it to you one more time
And seize when you find Rapper Pooh and Wonder 9
Art-iste witta line, I'mma wit the rhyme
Poobie sticks like WHO? Fraiser in his prime
Said I'm number one, ass frown, bitch niggas squat down
All the J's stand up, tear them old plans up
"Sleepers" keep you awake, bass lines penetrate
So we back to demonstrate, get it straight - MOVE!
You, you just a front, you, dos what I want to
Choose what I won't do, fuck it, we break rules!
Miles kinda Blue like, Sally on the tube like
Poobie, he write the blues like NIGGA, THAT's OLD NEWS!
I ooze witta, grooves witta, soothes witta who-witta
Whos-hitter, shoe fitter - THE KID CAN'T LOSE!
Tommy's on the move sick, word to Mike Burvick
Niggas ain't heard shit, mic's got a firm grip!

[Hook]

[Rapper Big Pooh - Outro]
Uh, HOJ shit...

Only the strong survive, my nigga...
