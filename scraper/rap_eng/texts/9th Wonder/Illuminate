[Verse One]
It's getting hot in here, cause that's the way I spit it
I'm not saying take off your clothes, just change your fake image
This industry isn't ready so we're takin' it slow
Strategize and stabilize the flow and change the status quo
Yo, I'm smakin', heads
Like jumpin' off a bridge
Into shallow waters filled with alligators and piranhas
I get, deep with beats and rhymes
Don't sleep on this
We're like the bed of sprites shinin' in the dark like city lights
Give me the microphone
Blazin' on any occasion
So hot, DJs touch it and their fingers look like raisins
We raisin' the bar
Me and my crew represent correct
Heaven sent dialect to resurrect the dead culture
It's still breathin'
I'll rock over the heartbeat
Livin' out every word I say before I start to speak
Illuminate your area
Section when we enter it
Not just to entertain
But also for your souls benefit

Chorus: [x2]
We illuminate in every city and state
Lightheaded and LifeSavas
Next door neighbors
We bring it from a northwest state of mind
And every time we rhyme, shine, illuminate
"Yeah!"

[Verse Two]
Now, Aurora Borealis style
Dance around and paint the clouds
Golden light illumination, expose you to soulful sounds
Straight from the city surrounded by moun-tains
In or out of town Lightheaded sure to put it down
So whenever you're around, be sure
To come bare witness, sit, listen for a minute it's intense
With each adrenaline tripling effects
Of instant induce in the sentence of interest
When one, we are able to (two)
See projections of three four
The pleasure
Add up to five
When combined
With the life preserving persons of our kind
Six and seven totally divine when moon and reverend shine

[Verse Three: Omega Whatts]
Eight, Ninth Wonder construct my melodic backdrop
Your throat iced while I toss rocks that shatter your glass image
I light up spots and search for the authentic
Life preservative, like sugar in blood streams for diabetics
This world state is chaotic
In need of luminescence
So Omega Whatts, ever ready to bring a divine presence
Sustained
By the crys of the innocent who are born
Death through words, killin' the unborn
Every accord of our future elect
Citizens, who will respect our creators creations
Teachin', shedding light on all aspects
Of mankind
My vision risin
As the phoenix airborn above the same old songs
My band plays on

[Hook]
