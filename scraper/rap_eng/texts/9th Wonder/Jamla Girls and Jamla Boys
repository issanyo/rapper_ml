[Verse 1]
Jamla girl in the building tonight
On the dance floor rocking left to right
Sipping on Mareto with the orange and ice
Red Guess jeans and some heels for hype
We're gonna party all night 'til Sirotto crash
95 live, just as hot as the last
Some more flames and all my past
You wanna reconnect? Well I think I'll let them just pass
Pass, 4th side, close to the [?] side
Drink 'til I'm tipsy, ain't no driving tonight
Work hard, play hard, the motto we live
15 whole years later and we still playing big
After the party, take it back to the crib
And make sure you got some magnums; you don't want no kids, dick
Life changes, like [?] bangers
[?] strangers, dude
I don't keep it on the hush, hush
Yo, for him and I only do is discuss
Too many broads here that I distrust
Once they know you in love, they all in your business
Yo, witness me in my culo pro
Move through the party like a valet [?]
Smooth like rovers when they turn the corner
[?] white light, that's the kind of shine that [?]
Yo, the lime light, I ain't really about that
I ain't really about popping bottles, VI stat
One some one more chance, everybody gonna dance
I'm on the [?] never [?], never shot my [?]
Feel all like a [?], no VIP
Catch me in the center of the floor; referees
Rocking 1-2 step into the perfect beat
It's all here tonight if you're rocking with me

[Verse 2]
Jamla girl in the building tonight
On the dance floor rocking left to right
Sipping on Mareto with the orange and ice
Red Guess jeans and some heels for hype
We're gonna party all night 'til Sirotto crash
95 live, just as hot as the last
Some more flames and all my past
You wanna reconnect? Well I think I'll let them just pass
Jamla girls in the building tonight
On the dance floor rocking left to right
Sipping on Mareto with the orange and ice
Red Guess jeans and some heels for hype
We'll gonna party all night till Sirotto crash
Word to the memory [?]
Some more flames and all my past
You wanna reconnect, well I think I'll let them just pass, pass
Jamla boys in the building tonight
Jamla family, we ride open to life
I spend a little dough on an outfit
Yeah, the grind paying off, I'm about this
Rocking mics is a benefit
I'm beneficial if you spend your life on the bench
Trying to play hard, cause I work the hardest
So turn it up, yeah, let me get it started
Stay on the move like the life of artist
I'ma get it rocking like [?]
Yop, on the one with rock and move to the left
Ain't a person here live who don't know the 2 step
And good company, we're having fun
Mommy used to tell me that'll keep you young
Jamla family in the building tonight, yo
Working Michael Jackson, we gonna rock it tonight, yo

[Outro]
Jamla girls in the building tonight
On the dance floor rocking left to right
Sipping on Mareto with the orange and ice
Red Guess jeans and some heels for hype
We'll gonna party all night till Sirotto crash
We'll gonna party all night till Sirotto crash
We'll gonna party all night till Sirotto crash
