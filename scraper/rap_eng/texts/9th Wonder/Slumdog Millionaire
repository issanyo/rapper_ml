[Verse 1: Pilot]
You can walk straight lines on that alcohol
You belong with eight or nine of them other broads
You survived and stayed fly when they used thunderbolt
Flew so high, but never forgot that you ain't above the law, fuck them all
They wasn't waiting until the day I rose
The hoes that waited until the day I chose
Sitting in rows, wanting a rose on a bumpy road
Looking for street vendors and peace sign senders
See signs in the center of everywhere I enter
I guess I overthink, man, I guess I overthink
One giant leap for mankind, I got supernova links
Cobra venom, some red rum, and momentum
Hope I float, bird hoes laying eggs, sunny-side, poached, or fried
Man, the flow divine, and those combined with these crazy rhymes
Hitting ladies' lines, hazy, feel like staring her down with the lazy eye
But the third eye giving death stares, blinking to the beat of the best snares
And I know that ain't fair, but I don't care
Because I'm a motherfucking slumdog millionaire, Bitch

[Hook: Pilot]
And shit shouldn't be surprising
Piff for the peeps and Pilot
Been gifted with recent progress
Pottery class for the poverty
We still on the sidewalk pissing
Listening, but not hearing
Or looking no further than what we appear as
What we appear as is mortal, but everlasting in the spirit
And we here in the flesh, pierce through your flesh
And we here in the flesh, pierce through your flesh
Peer pressure's a bitch, dirty tactics, pressure washes
Never caught red-handed, just with green in my pocket
Dirty money only circulated in the system
Or good kush in my system

[Verse 2: Pilot]
Dumb broads don't suit the slumdog
They throwing mazel tovs for the ball hogs
I'm an under groundhog
So you can elect a buzz gathering nigga, but it won't affect me at all
I'll just dig in the crates and attack you next turn
Like that nigga is really under the weather
Whether or not I reign, before or after the commas came
Inducted into the hall of fame
God flows, call me Charlamagne
Far from great as far as numbers go
Flows hotter than buffalo wing sauce
Playing ping pong all day, my brain versus my heart
When they should be cohesive to rip apart these demons
Wavy flows with a gnarly sequence
Doper than Jeff Hardy's entrance
But soon as I arrive, only five minutes until the party's ending
And that ain't fair, but I don't care
Because I'm a motherfucking slumdog millionaire

[Hook: Pilot]
And shit shouldn't be surprising
Piff for the peeps and Pilot
Been gifted with recent progress
Pottery class for the poverty
We still on the sidewalk pissing
Listening, but not hearing
Or looking no further than what we appear as
What we appear as is mortal, but everlasting in the spirit
And we here in the flesh, pierce through your flesh
And we here in the flesh, pierce through your flesh
Peer pressure's a bitch, dirty tactics, pressure washes
Never caught red-handed, just with green in my pocket
Dirty money only circulated in the system
Or good kush in my system
