[Verse 1]
Welcome to the 9th Dimension
Where ya dreams come true, put you in the right position
Gotta set the mood, roll somethin’ nigga light a incense
This that Badu meets Ja Rule
This that praying with the ahkis in Istanbul
This that I ain't got a dollar but at least I'm cool
I keep a level head
My father raised me a thoroughbred
This a moment to say the shit that I never said
Cut from the cloth of love it's woven in every thread
This street life unspoken don't catch the heavy lead
If this the life you choose, you gotta move appropriate
And my advice to you, is stay away from opiates
Stay woke, stay focus, stray away from hopelessness (huh)
I know the greener grass is hard to choose
And when you deep in concrete it make it hard to move
And when ya habitat is trapped it make hard to prove
That you could break the chain, and make a change in all the views
Of this land we occupying cause it's all illusion
Defying all the rules just to promote inclusion
Oxymoron, never left the hood but driving in a foreign
But just to see you live, I'll trade in all my organs
I just really need more time
To organize the team, and immortalize the dream
And that box logo never signified supreme
I'm dignified and well positioned on the larger scheme
I practiced to be an author, but I was born a king
And we all are, and we all sing
And we all are, and we all sing

[Hook]
We slicker this year, we slicker this year
We just tryna maintain, without a nickel to spare (yeah)
We slicker this year, we slicker this year
We just tryna maintain, without a nickel to spare (yeah)
We slicker this year, we slicker this year
We just tryna maintain, without a nickel to spare (yeah)
We slicker this year, we slicker this year
We just tryna maintain, without a nickel (a nickel)

[Verse 2]
Word to 9th, we all certified kings and queens
If I don't ever sleep, then tell me whose in charge of dreams
My momma talk to me bout patience, what does all it mean?
And they always doing maintenance but it's hardly clean
Street soldiers dying martyrs in the name of green
They arrest us on the basis of a racist theme
Got my niggas beating cases, what a wasteful thing
I'm tryna take us different places to escape the scene
Yeah, I'll set the precedence
And I'll take us all out of the hood and cop a residence
And I'll hit a lick wit you and get rid of the evidence
Remember skipping school, and rolling up, and sipping medicine
We was sick of rules, unruly niggas, ain't know better then
We were truly rookie niggas, but we felt like veterans
Couldn't wait to get the cookie just to go and tell our friends
Committing hella sins
Getting high to reach the heavens, then it’s back to hell again
I'm just tryna restore the broken pieces
I'm just hoping that freedom is close enough to reach it
I just hope learning life enough to go and teach it
Why you think I write this stuff, ain't for no other reason
But to empower a legacy with some power
To go and conquer the world and take reign like a shower
And build an empire like the tower

[Outro]
"I don’t think they hear you Cyph, say it louder"
To empower a legacy with some power
To go and conquer the world and take reign like a shower
And build an empire like the tower
I’m tryna make my family proud and make God prouder
