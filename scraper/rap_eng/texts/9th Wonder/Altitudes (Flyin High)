"Attention all passengers
We'd like to welcome you to Flight 919 headed to Raleigh, North Carolina
Where the temperature is currently a sunny eighty-five degrees
My name is Simone and I'll be your flight attendant for today
Once we reach our intended altitude of thirty thousand feet
We will be serving you the finest of Hip Hop music
So sit back, relax and enjoy your flight"

[Phonte]
Uh, uh, ye-ye-yeah yo, check it, check it
Aiyyo before we take off for the evening
Attention all passengers, this is your captain speaking
Just wanna thank y'all for buying tickets just to ride with us
No pun intended, but yo, y'all some fly niggas
The friendly skies are our passionate cost
Pride ourselves in great service and immaculate floors
So kick your feet up, relax at the bar
On behalf of us all, I'll pass it to my co-captain in change

[Rapper Big Pooh]
What's happening y'all? This Big Pooh, your co-captain speaking
Before we take off, I'd like to send a warm greeting (hello)
Please alert the stewardess for any things you needing
Buckle up tight, and I say this with good reason
We lost a few people before, they couldn't eat what we serve
Cause our food, you can't buy in the stores
It locked their jaws and they still not talking
Instead of catching flights, these days they steady walking

[Phonte]
They steady walking and steady gawking when I'm out with the squadron
Only one record out and already we marked men
But I'm just playing, this thing ain't cautious
Expect competition to take some losses for passing us down
This is our flight, we manning it now
Remember when y'all niggas didn't give a fuck like we was chastity belts
Guarantee they ain't gon' laugh at me now
You even when I'm taking off baby, yeah we still getting down
Now come on

[Hook]
[Pooh] Over the clouds and beneath the sky
It's Big Pooh and Little Brother still flying high (flying high)
The world's finest, ain't no need to lie
Cause even when I'm on the ground I'm still flying high (flying high)
[Phonte] It's Phonte up in the place to be
Representing world wide from sea to sea (flying high)
We rock the spot most definitely
It's Little Brother flying high for the world to see (flying)

[Rapper Big Pooh]
Who ready for a trip where the sky's the limit?
These days nobody slide, they rely on gimmicks
The last seven-forty-seven, three pilots in it
We so above the rest, seats reclining in 'em
Fuck designer linen, it's about giving back
Rated number one for service, ain't no doubting that
Where the customers at? They all set for the take off
From NC to CA, niggas don't get a day off
Shit, we need some lay offs, there's too many planes flying
Below the radar, there's too many planes dying
We keep it going, still gliding overseas
Up in the way, stay moving at God's speed

[Phonte]
On these flights we stating the facts, first class
And the Craig T. Nelson niggas straight to the back
Check him envy in my leather seats, in my cockpit with better beats
Nothing but blue skies ahead of me

[Hook]
[Phonte] NC, begin our decention
[Pooh] Fasten on belts and pay attention
[Phonte] This ride was brought to you with the warmest of intentions
[Pooh] The crew and the staff would like you to thank you for your patronage
[Phonte] A good flight is only what you make of it
[Both] Home is where we taking it
[Pooh] Until our next chance to lift off
And serve all with extreme pleasure
LB's an unfound treasure
Taking trips anywhere
[Both] No matter whether
[Phonte] The skies are grey
It's cold captain, I'm inclined to say
That we provide the best service in the US nighttime or day
Them other flights don't mean shit to me
Hell, look down and you'll probably see the head of your favourite MC, oh-ohh

"Attention all passengers
