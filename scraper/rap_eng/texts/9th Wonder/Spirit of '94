[Verse One: Kaze]
I've been fluent in ebonics since Snoop smoked chronic
When life was a bitch and Sally tricked on Stetsasonic
I was rocking jumpers, one flat down with summer tonic
Little nigga with a vision to bust, flows bionic
Stay paid, rock my hightop fade, dipped a rayon
My starter culture has to match the colors of the crayons
I found role models off of beat street and breaking
Cuz my pops stayed drunk but still he brought home the bacon
Now my momma taught me manners
Better reading or writing
To counter act all of my dads drinking, smoking and fighting
Some people ain't like him
So I walked and talked like that
Used my words like weapons, Kaze talk like gats
Because the fact is hip hop grabbed my head and took control of me
When I was all alone and nobody was holding me
I pop in the cassette, freestyle, my flow was wet
Hit the floor dripping sweat spinning bout to break my neck
But shit, way before the helicopter
The boombox up in my high school locker
Was known for blasting tracks that's hella proper
All these teachers ripping acting mad as fuck
Cuz I'm getting straight A's with D's in conduct
Kevy Kev was my name
Hip hop was my game
But then crack hit the street then the shit had all changed
Everybody busting guns, dealing drugs or faking claims
But on the real buck a soldier and his culture remains, nigga
A throwback running up these walls like Bo Jacks'
You nothing without knowledge of self, player know that
You nothing without knowledge of self, player know that
Player know that

[Hook: Kaze]
I wish that I could go back
To them days when respect was earned
And everybody wrote their own raps
To all my heads lets switch this fiction with fact
Then rock this track like a throwback (Blaow)
Tell 'em hold that
There's four elements that keep it intact
Before you rap you gotta know that
Man this the throwback
So pay your dues
Respect your pioneers
North cack we bringing hip hop back this year

[Verse 2: Kaze]
I love this hip hop shit
Just like a redneck love a rebel flag
Catch me with my pants sagged
Dippin' out a twenty bag
Aiming for that black wall street type of salary
Don't let the liquor and the weed fuck up your mentality
The game is smash mouth
When you dealing with the cash route
You get one shot, you either in or assed out
'Cause these companies be thinkin' black folks are all the same
Dress us up, have us cool rapping, fucking up the game
Ain't no more art forms, rhyme skills, rocking medallions
Now it's twenty inch, ice, coke, kill a ho', violence
But still, to each his own I'mma just live my life
Before you pull the burner out your coat, just think twice
This is the sound of the culture it's my job to insult the
Biggie, Pac wannabes and all executive vultures
Cuz just like alot of heads, shit I was raised on this
Hoodied up in a cypher rhyming, pumping my fist
And I ain't never have no corny tunes or pop no Crys'
2003 you front and you will get dissed
And that's some MC shit for those that don't know
Drink milk but if your mind locked down you won't grow
I'mma rep it like the forefathers
So baby holla if you hold down your hood stay fly and stack dollars
With the mind state of '88
Spirit of the '94
If knowledge ain't your power, what the fuck is you rhyming for?

[Hook: Kaze]
I wish that I could go back
To them days when respect was earned
And everybody wrote their own raps
To all my heads lets switch this fiction with fact
Then rock this track like a throwback (Blaow)
Tell 'em hold that
There's four elements that keep it intact
Before you rap you gotta know that
Man this the throwback
So pay your dues
Respect your pioneers
North Cack we bringing hip hop back this year
