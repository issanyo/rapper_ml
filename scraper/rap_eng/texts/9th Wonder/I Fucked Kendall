[Verse 1]

I fucked the dollar green
Ever since I woke the dream
Young niggas seeing what I seen
Tongue bitches drinking purple lean
New richies seein' keen
But nigga I got take one
Got the bread saying I'm not gonna pay 1
Got the lead saying I'm not gonna paint, son
But I got more in storage
Since the keys a bakers dozen
Get ready for these mad puns

[Verse 2]

Bustin' cheeks but I'm nuttin' beans
When the babes roll out, they got beats in mouth
Them asses sold, but I'm passing gold
Classy jokes, but they rake in shows
When they got their slowdown four count
Grow, shout, you gotta let it fuck out
Droppin' like it's hot loud
Let it row out
Ship is on the shore route

[Verse 3]

Writing them dreams but I'm letting em hear
The Biggie got him oh my g overseeing
They got a capri but I busted his teeth
They got it for me but I got shit for free
He hoes been in doubt but they bother ha being
Saudi merc found in the curse, go ahead I allowed the verse
Ripping in their words
The 8 figure check in, and 9 killer bets
25k I lent and 100 percent in the middle
I'm kidding the riddle is simple so lets get to the singles
I fucked Kendall
