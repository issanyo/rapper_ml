(Verse 2) "I'm not excited to start the week because Mondays are so mundane, I should sip ciroc til' I overdose and have to have my lungs drained, but I don't drink nor smoke so I have to find excitement in some way, guess I'll break into my exxes house shoutin' "get on the ground" with this gun raised, cause I just bought this new chopper that roar louder than Mufasa, actually I don't own a gun I'm playing the jokes on you gotcha!, target my name..that'll get you scarred and in pain, so it's best that you keep quiet cause not a part of me's sane, I've heard I'm hard to contain and they want me barred in a cage, so come close and I'm throwin' bows like a bad day at an archery range!, you keep on gassing yourself up by saying you're sharp with the aim, but I have yet to see a spark from the gauge, even if you had a strap on (strap-on) I don't think you'd be as HARD as you claim, you buff for nothing going hard on them weights, so I can care less about your muscle if your cut like glass, those cut-like calves..my black blade will cut right past nigga!"

(Verse 3) "I'm a fan of accident-prone when people talk nonsense, I hope you get struck in the head with a block object, until the point that you can't function because your not conscious, I hope you drown in a lake after gettin' tossed off deck, if I had AIDS I'd tie you down and force raw dog sex, I wanna walk around with your newborns chopped off neck, I hope after your family buys their new Dodge yaw'll wreck, it might be strange but this is my everyday thought process!..GRR-GRR-GRR-GRR I'm A Psychoooo"
