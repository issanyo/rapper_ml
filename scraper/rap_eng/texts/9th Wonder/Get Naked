[Verse 1: Murs]
5'10", Pale Skin, No Bullshit
Thick as fuck, now I think i gotta pull this
Them tattoos on the chest
Had to show her how we do this shit back West
I said, "you lookin' like you came by yourself"
I see you in the Killer Reese is there anyone else
Like myself
You know that I'm the headliner
Back in the day I was a good off the head rhymer
I'm free flowing
Now she showing me some teeth
I don't know where this is going but I'm hoping that at least
We can go and get some drinks
Have some conversation
I can see how she thinks
Cuz if there ain't no connection
Or no type of intellect then i ain't getting no erection
Not on no dead prez shit tho
I'm trying to fuck
All that mindset shit can go
No disrespect bro thats not me
If not tonight then eventually
A gentleman is just a wolf being patient
I'm hoping I can feel up on your booty while we waiting

[Hook: Murs]
My momma said she wanted something she could shake it to
So i thought about a song I could make for you
Without the cursing I don't know if I could make it through
This is something for the B@$%@^$ to get naked to (3x)
Without the cursing I don't know if I could make it through
This is something for the B@$%@^$ to get naked to

[Verse 2: Murs]
Now why is B@$%@^$ such a bad word
When i call myself a nigga thats just absurd
Every nigga ain't a king
Every bitch ain't a queen
See thats really not my thing
Not trying to be a dictator
Im just part of the scene
But you can get this dick later if you know what I mean
She was only 19 but she was fine as fuck
But if you really wanna fuck with me its 20 and up
I took her bra off
Now hop up in the backseat and turn the car off
Lets make a backseat baby
Pull them panties down
And spread your asscheeks baby
I know thats crazy graphic
But if ya stilll wanna do it throw it back and let me smack it
And i know thats hella ratchet
Educated street nigga its all part of the package
Shoutout the heartbreak gang
HBK it's all love when we bang
For [?]
It's so many pretty chicks its hard for me to say no

[Hook: Murs]
My momma said she wanted something she could shake it to
So i thought about a song I could make for you
Without the cursing I don't know if I could make it through
This is something for the B@$%@^$ to get naked to, What(problem)
This is something for the B@$%@^$ to get naked to, What(problem)
This is something for the B@$%@^$ to get naked to, What(problem)
Without the cursing I don't know if I could make it through
This is something for the B@$%@^$ to get naked to

[Verse 3: Problem]
Okay Murs yeah put me on the girls song
Cuz im the guy that gets all the girls
I know, i know
I say what
And they fuck
On each other while i fuck
On another
While we watch
Like two clocks
On the wristes
Of the vixens
I had gettin
All the chicken
From these niggas
I had trippin
Cuz they don't know how to pick 'em
So they quickly come a victim
I relick em
I relick em
I ain't talkin bout no tongue
She gettin paper
So now she homeless
No bum
Heard she got a roomate with her
And they both so fun
Both yellin out my name
Yet i don't know theirs

Hold on no
You ain't even got to tell me bitch
I so dont care
Ha ha
My wrist is so sunny
So your soul gon share
What up 9th
Too busy living to hold on (what)
Bitches take your heart and break in two
Hoes on
Turn bow
Oh no
I gotta stay on this player shit
Then i stand on every word
So i dont budge when i say that shit
I like all these bitches but im in love with this bangin shit
Cuz the fakers
Are the shakers
As sooon as [?] this shit
So just enjoy the moment baby
Enjoy the moment baby
Better have a condom because i dont want no other baby
I just took a hoo
Gonna walk a little crazy

Church
What(4x)
