[First Verse: Mecca Rebell]
I guess you can say how I bring home the bread
Is cannibalism turned on itself cause we feeding off the dead
Zombies be suckas tradin' their soul for grams at a time
Throwin' their life away for a quick high by me? That's fine
Sucka don't hate, hol' up lemme educate
You don't know what it's like where I'm from how you can expect to relate?
Where I reside it's either represent a gang or jail
Self imposed purgatory or a government hell, well
In this society to rise you must step on another shoulder
Competition mang I gotta meet the quota
Granted I'm doin' things I don't wanna
But what's a man s'posed to do then to pack heat in a sauna
I gots to bake the dough one way or another
Mother's son but I'm the father figure
Needa feed my sisters and mother
What a man gots to do a man gots to do
There ain't no other way this what saved meh and my familay
Those who try to stop meh is the enemay
Makin' it rain white haze green even in front of Lady Gray
Drugs be the product customers be the dead yeah
Doin' what I gotta do to bring home the bread

[Second Verse]
Bring it back bring it back second verse I'm a different man
C.E.O. Of a corporation that rapes the land
Whatever we can profit we cop it end of topic
Got money feedin' the lawyers yo y'all can' stop it!
There's no value in it if it don't bake the dough
One slice ain't enough mufucka I want the whole loaf!
With green so clean I slide my way through regulations
Destruction for my resurrection yes, Hell creation
The hell with the trees death to them bees look at 'em plead
I laugh at the suckas that chant “Stop it please”
It's dog eat dog sucka nasty world out here
Relentless competition so there ain't no room for tears
I do what I gots to do to remain on top
Souls of the dead keep my butter churnin' flame burnin' hot
Rule of life, some get most and some get least
With the bread I'm bakin' seems tonight I'm gonna have a feast
