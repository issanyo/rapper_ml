[Skit]
I’m a black man
I don’t know how to sing
And I don’t know how to dance
And I don’t know how to preach to no congregation
I’m too small to be a football hero
And I’m too ugly to be elected mayor
But I watch TV
And I see all them people
In all them fine homes they live in
And all them nice cars they drive
And I get all full of ambition

[Intro]
Yeah
9th Wonder
Splash-izzo
It’s like this
Yo

[Verse 1]
More money, more murder, more homicide
More niggas that I know committin’ genocide
Like the night that my pops almost fuckin’ died
Bullets split’em in his leg, start to tenderize
Have you seen innocence in an infant’s eyes
Death is real think we all need to emphasize
Ricki Lake act a fool when it’s televised
M.A.D. told my girl not to drink and drive
Driving Miss Daisy, Morgan Freeman wasn’t crazy
Middle Passage from Africa was fuckin’ crazy
Extermination of the Jews man was fuckin’ crazy
Niggas not rockin’ condemns so freakin’ crazy
I don’t rock throwbacks guess I’m fuckin’ crazy
As a child you was a fan of the Muppet Babies
You grew up still a follower, a muppet baby
Don’t appreciate life man I can’t stand it
You remind me of an episode from Knots Landing
A hard rock on the street, tough made of granite
Undercover tits poppin’ out like your Janet
They got common sense but they don’t see The Light
You’re days comin’ motherfucker appreciate life

[Refrain]
We tryin’ to make power moves you can keep that shit
You don’t appreciate life you gone need that shit
Mad niggas round the way be dyin’ everyday
Abortions shootouts what more can I say
Get cake raise kids live life have fun
Cause whatcha gonna do when you don’t have one
I said whatcha gonna do when you don’t have one
I said whatcha gonna do when you don’t have one niggas

[Verse 2]
Remember 9/11, a heart to heart
You never thought the US would go this far
Now we in the limelight cause they bomb tight
Time to wear shades blow up like the World Trade
They tradin’ bonds and stocks on Wall Street
White collar crime verdict draw more heat
Billionaires, money, power, respect
Election year, phonies, cowards with checks
I took it there to revive your consciousness
You didn’t think Splash would hit you with some honor shit
C’mon man I’m the last of a dying breed
Kemet Nu, Ashra Kwesi
Marcus Garvey you niggas ain’t hardly
Scratchin’ the surface you’re worthless your purpose
Distorted, you’re an indigent servant
Some hypocrites that practice but don’t preach
Too many ya’ll niggas like sand at the beach
I’d rather fuck wit’ something real I relate too
Food for thought so a buffet I made you
Alter ego, mankind, take a listen
Appreciate life nigga use your intuition
Use your intuition

[Refrain]
We tryin’ to make power moves you can keep that shit
You don’t appreciate life you gone need that shit
Mad niggas round the way be dyin’ everyday
Abortions shootouts what more can I say
Get cake raise kids live life have fun
Cause whatcha gonna do when you don’t have one
I said whatcha gonna do when you don’t have one
I said whatcha gonna do when you don’t have one niggas

[Outro]
Yeah yeah
You only got one life one life one life
Yo yo
You only got one life one life c’mon
Yeah
It’s like that man
You only get one of them joints yo
One life one life
Yeah
