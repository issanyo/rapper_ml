[Phonte]:
I don't think they know how dirty this sport is
This morning just spittin' rhymes, don't get it distorted
And y'all can choose to ignore it
But still I'm stoppin' you popcorn niggas from thinkin' you important
Whether they buy the CD online or import it
I'm heard in all states/Allstate and I don't mean insurance
Because I stay true to my following
Instead of you hollowing fickle fans that blow with the wind currents
See nigga, I've been learnin' the ropes of my team
Been burning your hopes and dreams of being the next ones
I go on a wreckin' mode and sound like an episode
Of Who Wants To Be An Ass and you the next contestant
My God
Nigga get some protection
Call Spielberg or Benny Boom and get some direction
Cause your whole art is garbage
Phonte, lines hit the hardest
I'm rap's heavyweight and me and Leg are sparring partners
What?
