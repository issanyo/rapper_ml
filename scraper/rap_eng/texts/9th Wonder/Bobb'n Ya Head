[Verse One]
Marvelous, Marvin Hagglar on the the triddack
Mr. T mohawk rocked under my fitted
Out to book shawty's who want the seven digits
Take 'em to my rest, divide my human Kit Kat
Uh huh
I'm 'bout to switch that
Somersault, double pump, yeah I'm 'bout to flip that
Your songs on the radio? Shit it's time to flip that
Verses at the station that base it for playin' triddash
And oh yeah, my name is Spliddash
Known for droppin' science but minus all of the gimmicks
Real life music on Earth, no outer limits
Outer look [?], my niggas hear that
The nicest niggas out, c'mon my nigga kill that
Amplify truth, ha ha, I know you feel that
Wanna conversate? Nah uh, cut all the chit chat
Critics still talk and your mouth is where my dick's at

[Hook] {x2}
I know you bobbin' your head
And once again it's on and once again it's on my niggas

[Verse Two]
How about some hardcore?
Yeah we like it raw
Doggin' on the track but condom for most whores
Stitches, ice packs and plus we wire jaws
Battle raps fittest, speed and crashed doors
On Friday night we rush the dance floor
Coronas, E&J, the liquor we crave for
Basic footwear, 4X and white tees
Split personalities like I'm Kool Keith
Helmet, shoulder pads are essential for the beef
Change your penny loafers homeboy, you needin' cleats
One hit wonder? What's your name, Mr. Cheeks?
Hahahahaha
