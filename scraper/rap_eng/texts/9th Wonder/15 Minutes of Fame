[Verse 1: BJ The Chicago Kid]
I remember back in the beginning
I was scared to give you my love
I didn’t wanna let go of all these women
Then I believed and began to trust
And messing around was very tempting
Cus even the bad ones buss
And girl I never thought you’d be the one
To leave me

[Bridge: BJ The Chicago Kid]
I had to let it breathe for a while cus
Cus girl when you left me I was broken down
Yea I was broken down for a while but
But that’s when I woke up and said

[Pre-Hook: BJ The Chicago Kid]
The first 5 minutes
I put you all in it
Then something went wrong and you ran
Over the next 5 minutes
You left for 5 minutes

[Hook: BJ The Chicago Kid] (Add-2)
And that was your 15 minutes of fame
(5, 10, 15, time’s up)
(5, 10, 15, time’s up)
And that was your 15 minutes of fame
(5, 10, 15, time’s up)
(5, 10, 15, time’s up)
And that was your 15 minutes of fame

[Verse 2: BJ The Chicago Kid]
Heard the guy you left me for wasn’t even faithful
But you went to him anyway
Heard every time you left from seeing him yea
But he had another one on the way
Girl just to think I still love you
Yea, a nigga have to be crazy
And girl I never thought you’d be the one
To leave me

[Verse 3: Add-2]
Hold up
Yo! Clock’s tickin'
I fell for someone who couldn’t stop trippin'
Listen up, if yo' heart broke you better glue the pieces
I put my ex down like there’s treasure underneath 'er
Love me in the limelight but the spotlight fades
Back of the jersey all you wanted was a name and
Guess I was to blame even thinkin' you would change
Like Spike, like Jack, I watched you play games every day
What’s the point of a partner you can’t depend on?
Drowning in emotions, that ain’t a surface to swim on
You never gon' get it like En Vogue in the friend zone
Seen it comin' quicker like a psychic who a nympho
But I’m cool on my bullshit
Like a matador with new shoes avoid the bullshit
Said I was the one like Neo and I’m guessin' you was right
When you left felt I dodged a bullet
15 minutes, 15 minutes
15 minutes, baby girl you’re gone
Know I used to love 'er, word to Common, I ain't never hatin'
I’m turnin' tables like I’m doin some redecoratin'
Fall in love, bring a parachute
Girl, love is blind, now I wonder what I seen in you
Girlfriends turnin', you want blowin up and now you like wow
Your 15 minutes end -- now
