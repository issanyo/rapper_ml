Intro
Yoh x2
Yoh turn the music up a lil bit in the heard phones my nigga
I'm about to spit this shit yoh!
Let me get em
Aaah!!

Verse 1
Okay I walk into the liquor store
Slamming at these bottle do this shit like Michelangelo
I had to get the antidote
Before I start to speak nigga get back
I had to kick back and lay my shit down
Do you get that, I hope you get that
Who gat the knowledge on how to make it with this rap shit
It's full of prophesy, they prophesy we niggas gonna lose
We the niggas that are never fooled
My nigga Ed he snatched you out I guess he's coming with the pending doom
So you better move
We the niggas with the groove
Still slamming on these beats up in the booth until it's noon nigga
More grip like twelve fingers
I zip you up into a body bag, ten killers
This shit is stuck inside my memories
I had to get a bottle sip this shit just for medicinal
To exercise my mental
This Hennessy make me noushsous
I feel it in my bones I guess it's killing my conscience
I really gat to speak to agree
That ama be the king when I bleed for the streets (yoh)
Ama be the nigga standing out for this shit (yoh)
Ama be the nigga with this shit (yoh) x2

Chorus x2
Okay I had a couple glasses before I speak
Meditating bout this shit don't know what's real
A lot of niggas wanna make it in the streets
I'm the nigga so I gatta be the King

Verse 2
Okay
Grabbing on my second glass
I barely can see, my vision blur
It's me and you we stuck in this moment
That's right
So ama spit this 24 times till I get it right
This is the reason why a brother standing before the mic
It like a pilot starring the plan in his cockpit
Ama savage I know how to maneuver this rape shit
His majesty raise the apocalypse
More critics than an analyst
It's Typical Kings rapping the finest shit
How many niggas with the pony tail
Better put them straight to jail, this is hell
I'm kicking these rhymes double X L
Like, I wanna be the King I'm a mortal being spitting these lines
So ama do this till the day that I die
The day that I fly
Ama stretch my wings till I reach the top
Cause at the bottom man I sway these niggas come and get you
Follow procedures
I'm sitting at the thrown
When I die ama leave my Norns resting on the thrown nigga
