[Verse]

I started out doing this to impress my older friends
And an outlet for my thoughts that I was holding in
That latter. yeah that went & became my formative
For my foundation, then i started recording it

Went outside on met many idols on my grind
Worked my craft I was on that, the bottom line
Became nice with the rhyme
The established would acknowledge my shine
I am Prime not Optimus

D original indeed
The experience would plant seeds
To learn and earn prestige like the Grand Prix
Those who only follow they can’t lead
Inspired by many but no one else I can be

Where does the plan lead? To whoever is listening
Understand it’s for me and whatever my mission is
Whether if it takes me on the road like Michelin
Or I stay at home where the 215 district is, I’m with it then

Can you believe I lost my steam?
Forgot what it means? As if there’s two extremes?
Never an in between? Saw sights I never seen
My Reality was fighting with my dream
So wait what do it mean?

Well let me define it
Let loose like water that go flowing out of a hydrant
Wrote this before 25 see where my mind is?
If not I suggest you go back & rewind it

But look, I wanna be understood while I’m alive
Maintain integrity while on my job
Paint images vividly of 215
Fly thru the air like Finn with a coup de grace
Forever I stay true to mine
Stand tall never lose your spine
Held it down never fooled with mine
When you think of Prime, think of the truest kind

I Keep pockets for the cost of integrity
Armed with Knowledge as weaponry for whatever’s ahead of me. I Make it last with my brevity, becoming vexed only leads to perplexity
So all that nonsense I am just severing
Armed with knowledge for whatever's ahead of me
Born 10/23 in fly dungarees
That's what I had to say, you can run the beat
Peace
