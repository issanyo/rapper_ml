[Intro: Sean Price]
Sean P!

[Verse 1: Sean Price]
Ayo, don't listen to your friends ma, no doubt
They on the outside looking in, they think they looking out
Trying to mess up a good thing
Trying to change the colors up in your mood ring
I'm having mood swings
We used to do things like walk in the park
Go home watch Madea as the reefer get sparked
But now you talk to your friends, it's changing your heart
Just give me back the chain with my name that's engraved in the heart
One!
P!

[Verse 2: Beyonc√©]
Take a minute girl, come sit down
And tell us what's been happening
In your face I can see the pain
Don't you try to convince us that you're happy, yeah
We've seen this all before
Brothers taking advantage of the passion
Because we've come too far for you to feel alone
You don't let him walk over your heart, I'm telling you

[Hook]
Girl, I can tell you've been crying
And you needing somebody to talk to
Girl, I can tell he's been lying
And pretending that he's faithful and he loves you
Girl, you don't have to be hiding
Don't you be ashamed to say he hurt you
I'm your girl, you're my girl, we your girls
Don't you know that we love you

[Verse 3: Kelly]
See, what y'all don't know about him
Is I can't let him go because he needs me
It ain't really him, it's stress from his job
And I ain't making it easy
I know you see him bugging most of the time
But I know deep inside, he don't mean it
It gets hard sometimes but I need my man
I don't think y'all understand, I'm telling ya

[Hook]
Girl, I can tell you've been crying
And you needing somebody to talk to
Girl, I can tell he's been lying
And pretending that he's faithful and he loves you
Girl, you don't have to be hiding
Don't you be ashamed to say he hurt you
I'm your girl, you're my girl, we your girls
Don't you know that we love you

[Verse 4: Sean Price]
Yo, it's like drama all night, drama all day
More damn drama than a Tyler Perry play
Diary of a Mad Black Woman part 2
Is playing at the Beacon and guess who the hell is featuring?
Sean Price, Boot Camp's best
Clean shirt, clean shoes like boot camp dress
And your friends stressing me out, I'm popping pills
We need help, call Dr. Phil
One!

[Bridge: Michelle]
Girl, take a good look at yourself
He got you going through hell
We ain't never seen ya down like this
What you mean you don't need us to help?
We know each other too well
Girl, you're my girl, we your girls
Don't you know that we love you

[Hook]
Girl, I can tell you've been crying
And you needing somebody to talk to
Girl, I can tell he's been lying
And pretending that he's faithful and he loves you
Girl, you don't have to be hiding
Don't you be ashamed to say he hurt you
I'm your girl, you're my girl, we your girls
Don't you know that we love you
Girl, I can tell you've been crying
And you needing somebody to talk to
Girl, I can tell he's been lying
And pretending that he's faithful and he loves you
Girl, you don't have to be hiding
Don't you be ashamed to say he hurt you
I'm your girl, you're my girl, we your girls
Don't you know that we love you
