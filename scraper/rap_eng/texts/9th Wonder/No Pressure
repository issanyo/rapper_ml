Lil B
One of a kind nigga
Define grinding, divine grind
Niggas lost and came up
Linen my pockets, hot as days, every day peep it
Niggas be running around with guns, ain’t even squeezing
I move a piece, I don’t carry the heater
I don’t got beef with niggas, I just buy a new freezer
Dump.. everything out of it
The South love it. ATA to Kentucky. New Orleans, Miami
B riding down with the candy
Bad bitch, she understand that I’m grimey
She look at me, I looking beside her
She talk to me, I’m walking inside her
She don’t understand the game
Life’s real, only one life to live
I done dropped that bullshit, now I’m sick wit it
Ill niggas is real, too real to break the deal
Make my own progress for real
Sometimes I feel niggas cry, when I smoke this dope
I don’t see the life real, my whole brain is smoke
Hide away from the pain like a nigga telling jokes about...
He really hurt, laughing about the situation
And let me tell you about this rap game
They try to take the things you love, like the crack game
Niggas live or die in this rap game
It’s rules you gotta move by
Fake niggas salute, with no alibi
Got a whole different plan about shine
Man, I just write from the heart, like left turn
Last burn, out the next pern?, niggas understand like worms
Underground by the paper, surrounded
My essence is something greater
Feel like a King resurrected, from old times
Gold up in my casket, with a brick of some white
Sell it off for real niggas moving at night
Uh, yeah, shit I had to get the money fast
Everyday life, real life, for real life
And you know this shit is so real
You know what I mean, nigga just gotta speak it
Yeah, will I make it off to Heaven, while I’m sitting on Earth?
I’m living everyday for its worth
And I’m moving while I can, while I’m young, sleep when I’m old
Growing for my family, doing it for them
Yeah, I can sleep when my money’s long
But I ain’t long enough when? to go stand on my money
And I ain’t tall enough
You would think I was lesser
Because you coming up with niggas ain’t built for the game
And they ain’t strong enough, you gotta have a long vision
Niggas is spitting and you play the fool
You either tie em up or keep moving
You gotta live life how you want to
Fuck the pressure, just do what you gon' do
Niggas gon' ride for a sentence
Niggas be dying on the blocks like humans
Fuck, if you gon' represent, represent
Be a leader, pick your own vision
