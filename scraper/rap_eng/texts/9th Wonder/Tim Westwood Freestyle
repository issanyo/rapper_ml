[Verse 1: Game]
Game don’t freestyle
Game don’t write
Game don’t talk about niggas it’s on site
Game don’t ride in cars, he ride bikes
Game don’t buy dem J’s, he calls Mike
Game don’t fly commercial, he fly private
Game ain’t on Tim Westwood, he on my shit
Game came in the game with Ross & Jeezy
Game don’t stand in line, he call Yeezy
Yeezy don’t pick up, Game don't press redial
Game know Khloe & Kim, they on speed dial
Game don’t wear no tux at big dinners
Game hit the Micky D’s with Kris Jenner
Game ain’t makin’ amends with 50 Cent
Game still tryin’ to find out where 50 went
Game ain't the type of nigga to fuck with your favorite rapper on IG making them duck lips
Game ain't at home, boy, Game in the UK
Freestylin' off the top, he like a toupée
Game got all the answers, I'm like two Ye’s
I'm an MCM, I'm fucking on Tuesday
Game don't do the Women Crush Wednesday
If I said I was, I was lyin' like Penn State
I'm the type of Game you don't play, no Monopoly boards, no NBA
No Xbox, nigga no PS4, I bring the games to life, COD at your door
Suge on Arsenio talkin’ about Game & Kendrick
My contract fucked up? How am I in this Bentley?
How am I in this Lambo? How am I in this Rolls?
Blood Money poppin’ where the fuck is Death Row?
Don’t mention Kendrick, let’s talk about what you got
Cause the big homie is exactly what you not
Word to Big U, word to Big Wack
Game came out niggas' mouths, then you heard the BBRRRAAAA
My niggas pull out guns, bitches starts crawlin’
After the shots, like Julie back to ballin’
All y’all must have forgot what Game do
Game don’t fall off nigga, he ain’t you
Now hold up a second, don't brandish a weapon
I got one in London, put holes in your brethren
My niggas is trippin', we all in your section
Let one get away and them hollows'll catch him
Then I PJ to Spain just to get a neckless
Sippin’ on syrup, like I play for the Texans
They talk about drugs and they know I’m connected
You can’t do shit with the boy, he protected
By la familia, 1 shot we killin’ ya
Blood money in London, 'bout to stack a milli up
La familia, 1 shot we killin’ ya
Blood money in Great Britain, 'bout to stack a milli up
Growing my beard out, lets bring philly up, Meek my nigga
Don’t even bring Gillie up
Cause every time you do, we stack a milli up
Like the new ROC go dig a milli up, boy
