[Verse 2: Norris]
Whoa, my brother, please put down that rope
When strange fruit rots man I just can't cope
Got some boots in my face from an equal in a noose
And a camera crew standing with a worldwide view
I tuned into Toonami for the last two weeks
Just to catch the next Naruto battle at its peak
I reek of sweat and anticipation
Jumping on my couch like I'm the next Frazier
A laser burns through my chest, I'm blessed
For all of these Sith lords to put me to the test
A mortal with some flaws and they bring out the best
The perks of being Perseus to cast away the stress
I pulled a nerf gun back when I was five years old
And another kid my age just cocked the Glock he stole
Rake the leaves off of money trees
Seeds will grow and bees pollinate

It's the beautiful decay
I felt beautiful while yesterday decays
It's the beautiful decay
When tomorrow comes around man watchu' gonna say?

[Hook]
