[Intro]
Yeah
One time for the one time just to feel, right
Uh, Yeah
Weekend for the weekend, you feel me?
Big homie waddup?[?] Waddup ya dig?
[?], you know
Feel right

[Verse 1]
Keep an, eye on em just like a farmer with plants
Still praying for the Garners and the Grants
For the extra funds I was working camps
Instead of my break was catching cramps
I went from not hearing no one to hearing chants
Caught in the middle my destiny running slants
Got rid of my couldn'ts and my can't's
Had a heavy chip on my shoulder working like ants
My crystal ball see hella fans, I'm well advanced
Never find time for anybody that lost their chance
I think God's speaking through me like Lecrae and Chance
Don't question my teaching but still raising hands
Still dipping my waffle fries in ranch
Girl think she golden but really hoeing like Blanch
When it comes to my white walkers and stans
Know the haters looking I still don't give em a glance
Folks said I wouldn't, choking on words now
At first wasn't eating, working on thirds now
My nigga just took his wife to Curacao
I'm so good if you round me you just be [?]
They talk bad about a goose when they speak to a goblin
Folk always looked puzzled, a piece to the problem
If friends don't tell you the truth is it really your potna?
Give me the real don't give me no Oscar(Nah)

[Bridge 1]
Give me the real don't give me no Oscar
(Oh yeah, Oh yeah, Oh yeah)
Give me the real don't give me no Oscar
(Oh yeah, Oh yeah, Oh yeah)

[Verse 2]
My city got Wolfpacks deeper than Raleigh bleachers
I ain't gutter but still would body a Gotti feature
Hit the girl from Berkley she got Ashanti features
I Murder Inc. she start cheesing like Blondie pizza
This one for the scrapbook
My checkbook bout to look like a math book
Road free, I wonder what the Cav took
Whoever rapping from back home a bad look
A day in the life, Mekhi Phife
Snakes influencing all these blind mice
As a black man I live once and die twice
They never purge the neighborhoods that ride bikes
Heart broke with fake tears I seen the tissue
Real insecure you got an Issa issue
I got my shit together, damn, why you mad baby?
You should've listened to bag lady
If God didn't do it I assume that Aladdin mad me
Niggas is bitch made more jealous than Jan Brady, what happened to you?
Get a co-sign from folk you want signatures from
Cards get pulled like niggas  in pictures with guns
My angel booked for the week had to vent to a nun
I'm not the guy that sell weight but I'm living with tons
On my shoulder I'm losing pounds with good intentions
Now they thinking like, "Damn he told me. I should've listened"

[Verse 3]
Buy my taco from the corner check the lingo
Now the world see it so they start to wink more
This for the players in Detroit still rocking their mink low
Hungover but with us she pro'lly still gon' drink though
Brushing dust off, still working I'm taking lunch off
Same bridge you 'bout to burn the one I had to jump off
Hanging with these millionaires hope it rub off
Owe it to myself, getting insufficient funds off
Mystery unsolved, artist spot me when I'm amongst y'all
Lotta folk I had to cut y'all, off from me
Hitchhiking, I know your trail
Everything I drop it be like show & tell
I heard you tried to shop music and get a sale
Yeah, that pro'lly ain't gon' go to well

[Bridge 2]
I stuck with it you give me grief for it
Ain't nothing out your reach just gotta reach for it
Any dream you had don't need sleep for it
For the ones can't speak for us, [?]

[Verse 4]
Hold meetings with execs who own homes abroad
Most folk don't even own their car
Haters hit me tell millions to hold the call
I need my patty with cheddar but tell her hold the slaw
She want Gucci and Gold I'm not the old MCcaw
That's probably over your head should take it slow for y'all
I'm for sure a star my [?] got biscuit in churches
Money like candy from granny I'm slipping in purses
When you start to talk that's when a cricket surfaces
I should diss you nigga but it's worthless
Egg hunter I found dollars from penny searches
From a Henny purchase to Nipsey verses

[Bridge 2]
I stuck with it you give me grief for it
Ain't nothing out your reach just gotta reach for it
Any dream you had don't need sleep for it
For the ones can't speak for us, [?]
