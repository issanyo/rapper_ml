[Intro: 9thMatic (aka 9th Wonder)]
Uh, yea, Rapsody
Return of the B-Girl
It go, light it up like a Molotov
Sparkle in the dark, starting at the start mark
Ready, set, go running out the block hard
The block hard, tre-four, word to my mom
Tre time is the charm, if the luck is on
So what the fuck, gwon, do what you want
9thMatic, attack it, uh, so whatcha gonna? Nothing
Live nigga for real, it's the return of the b-girl, Rap Diddy for real
Rap Diddy for real, it's the return of the b-girl, Rap Diddy for real
Rap Diddy for real, it's the return of the b-girl, Rap Diddy for real
Rap Diddy for real

[Verse: Rapsody]
Yea, grand return like Jordan '98
No bull, I calculate that I'll be one of the greats
Like [?] Ricky, cause I talk slicky like snake
Claim you dope, but like Nicole Richie you holdin' no weight
Unless you Ricky, Drake, Jay or Andre or Kanye
Slim picking, guess you lucked up on my come up you see
Cause I'm on it free, Willy the whale, T.I., Wayne post-jail
I'm nice, where most can't even rightly spell
Polite well, oh hell XXL
Tryna cover pages in your next XXL
Cause I'm next, what, you've waited three years?
I've been waiting 27, can't explain my tears
A joy like Pete Rock and Jay and Kanye
In Brightlady doing all-nights, calling home, my mate
For change, [?] gassing me up
Make change like 2 quarters, 5 dimes to a buck
To progress, low stress like west side, side
L.A. Dodgers dodging me, my flip side [?]
Carolina rise, mom and pops watched me struggle lots
Couldn't read me like CD, CD, purple plots
For Hip Hop, I made it work and blew up spots
Captain James Kirk, ain't it funny yea
I sit and look back a bit, a little girl, MC Lyte
Pretending to be that shit
And Jay, all day, working to be that slick
Like be one mixtape away from really mastering it
I got it, it's a Duke of [?] 1 through 9
I rhyme, shining a problem, yea, that's me papa
Proper, the damn near show stopper
In a truck and door knockers
It's return of the B
R to the A to the P-S-O-D-Y
Because I'm hot, and like doors, I got it locked
Rap, R to the A to the P-S-O-D-Y
Because I'm hot, and like doors, I got it locked
Rap, R to the A to the P-S-O-D-Y
Because I'm hot, and like doors, I got it locked
Rap, R to the A to the P-S-O-D-Y
Because I'm hot, and like doors, I got it locked
Yea, Rap
