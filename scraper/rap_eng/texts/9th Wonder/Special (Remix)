[Intro]
Yeah, back up in this
Yeah, Strange Fruit Project
Bringin' a little somethin' special on this one
Come on, 9th Wonder on the beat

[Verse 1: Symbolyc One]
Packing my bags , cause a brother wanna roll again
Maybe we can do this another time but I'm rowin' in
Start my motor man , I'm bout to head out
Say a little pray for myself and the I sped out
Thoughts on my family It got me hesitating now
Thoughts of insanity It got me meditating loud
Insane anger , brothers headin' for danger
Looking at my life shit is straight dangerous
It's all good, small hood, slang the dust
Another brother wanna aim and bust
So, Im out the hood and I'm living in the better city
Cause things go round like marry go so let it go
It's getting gritty , wonderin' where the crime went
Locked up, encarcelated, most of the time spent
Behind bars I rhyme bars if neccesary
Sort of scary how I be livin' , dwellin' in the cementery
So special ....

[Hook]
Touch, that very special

[Verse 2: Myone]
First of all I thank god for my life
Shouting out to both mommas for addressing the stresses
Of wrong and right , when the pressure was on
Discipline , was giving and getting in the zone
To get it while the getting is good instead of getting it on
So I let it be known , from suburbs
To the inner city gritty [?]
She living on curbs
Many a lyrical slur
Plug it in and appease the masses
Music got that [?] for more
Like please pass it
We breeze past the past now we classic
Beyond y'all platinum plaques and shrink wrapping
Made it 9 miles without Rabbit
Mad when the run around getting rerun what's happening?
The locks getting popped on the door of the industry
Cause you were on the bill and wasn't bringing no energy
Now we [?] like synergy
Remedy for the times when an artist lacking in rhymes
So I figure that I'm...

[Hook]
