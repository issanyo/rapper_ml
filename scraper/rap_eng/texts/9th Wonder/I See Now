Intro:
"I once was lost
But now I'm found...Amen!
I see now
Hey I see now!"

Verse 1:
"Feels like I haven't spit in a while
I was working on a verse at a church in the wild
Which means that I was busy resurrecting my style
Tryna figure it out with just a coke and a smile
I've been grinding so hard peep the sweat from my brow
With nothing to wipe me down man not even a towel
Like a lion in the jungle all I know is to prowl
And like a wolf to the moon all I know is to howl (now)!
You ever wonder what this life is about?
Ever think about the thoughts that you had as a child?
The universe is listening to what you say with your mouth
Think of how you can change the whole world with a vowel!
Wow! haha I see now
Once was lost cus I was in denial
Slithered through the river I swam through the nile
And reached for my dream-Hakeemed the rebound!

Hook:
"Wow! haha I see now
You was hurt now you on the rebound
Ben and Jerry's and Micky D's now
And you just gon' gain all that weight on me now
-NAW-
Naw fall back
If I ain't a player then what the hell ya call that?
A nigga disrespect me i'mma be in all black
But baby if you let me i'mma take it all back."

Verse 2:
"The house that I stayed at surrounded by the bricks
The job he got paid at its all cus of bricks
Chillen with a chick who was swinging off my stick
Tarzan and Jane mane, that thang was legit!
Pay attention when I spit
I'm nice with this shhhhhh
You gotta think quick
Inorder to get hip
Live from the abyss, I crawled outta the mist
My bars outta the park, while yours swing and a miss
How sick is this
How sick am I, to be shy to realize?
That i've transcended from the sky
To deliver mankind, from the lies
Thats disguised by the all mighty dollar
Covered under the eye
Eye for an eye make the whole world blind
A nick-for a dime keep the whole world fried
Imagine what would happen if the whole world died
The matrix its all in ya mind, its how God designed it!

Outro:
"I see now, I see now!"
