[Hook]
There’s two sides to my city, a red side and a blue side to my city
Too many died in my city, imagine if we all unified in my city
There’s two sides to my city, a red side and a blue side to my city
Too many died in my city, imagine if we all unified in my city

[Verse 1]
Black Adidas sandals with the stripes
Socks pulled up I'm West Coast for life
On my way to the store on the little homies bike
And I don’t break a sweat I let the young niggas fight
I done earned my stripes no you might lose your life
On any given night
Them black and white cars
Them dudes inside ain't from streets like ours
So they hop out with their guns drawn
Make us lay down on the front lawn
Knights take pawns to the holding cell
We hope we make bail by dawn
That's what really goes on
Where's Bunchy Carter man it’s been too long
Geronimo Ji Jaga hope Obama free Asata we just doing what we gotta

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Shout out to Tookie Williams, shout out to T. Rodgers
Shout out to all the homies locked down with no fathers
We had a lot of problems, seen a lot of drama
Some believe in Jesus, few of us believe in karma
We got daughters, a couple baby Mamas
But love can’t compete with the power of a dollar
You see over seas is what they building Impalas
While we’re working in the streets cause a job not promised
Graduate to a key become a street scholar
Cause red and blue rags are the new blue collar
It’s hard to swallow make me wanna holla
But you came hear my voice the radio don’t bother
Could play the positive I give you knowledge
On the whole west coast there ain’t no one Black college
Wonder why we got problems
Without knowledge of yourself it's impossible to solve em

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
The land of smog and earthquakes
Thought I’d be dead by my twenty first birthday
Fed cars, we ride dirty because the block's hot
Kevlar under Ibaka jersey's to block shots
When you enter a city that’s never known winter
Redistrict just so they can cut us out of the Staples Center
That’s less funding for schools
Now the kids with the guns make the rules
Hunger Games, Battle Royale, Lord Of The Flies
The city's re-born while more of us die
Gentrify, genocide, everywhere the rent is high
Watch a local business die then wonder why the tensions rise
We use music as release, as a Zulu I should teach so I do it over beats
The future's in our reach find solutions to the beef
Get every shooter in the streets to ride for universal peace

[Hook]
