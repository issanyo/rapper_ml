{Verse 1}
Honey, check it out, you got me mesmerized
Running through my mind for a real long time
Let me take you to a place, maybe we can unwind
And relax ourselves, that would be sublime
Yo, what's on your mind, love, I'm digging your style
Mutual attraction and your curious smile
First I hesitate at tryna figure you out
Thinking to myself "what she really about"
But I had to know, I'm the type that likes to take it slow
To hold the situation as I take control
Meticulously plotting on my best approach
On the down low, I don't want the rest to know
Smile baby, too perfect to be in blue
2 & 2 = 4 ever for me and you
That's too much time, too many steps for the journey
The lust for the love that lives internally
As I...

[Hook]
Go at ya hard, go at ya hard
Lady, don't play me, I have you saying "Baby, is you crazy?"
Go at ya hard, go at ya hard, girl, go at ya hard, go at ya part
Go at ya hard, Go at ya hard, Go at ya hard
Lady, don't play me, I have you saying "Baby, is you crazy?"
Go at ya hard, Go at ya hard, Go at ya hard
Lady, don't play me, I have you saying "Baby, is you crazy?"

[Verse 2]
It's so natural and comfortable to relate
Million dollar high when we conversate
Drug to my soul when we congregate
The more quality, the more time we take
You make me feel giddy like a child inside
So innocent, you gotta be a childsome guy
Giving words to a poet, reminiscing in the library
Thoughts of you make my pen move so steady
The whole vibe feels so damn right
Ancestors must've bonded in the previous light
It's dark without you like a grievous night
Like backtracking to my past, and believe me, it's trife
Believe me, it's trife!
No, really tho, my past, girl, believe me, it's trife!
Ain't nothing nice, but stop dwelling 'cos my past is gone
We need trust if we to ever go on
Just follow your heart, you can never go wrong
Have patience in the truth, you can never go long
Waiting all year, it might take a while
It's all worth it just to make you smile, just to make you smile

{Hook]

[Verse 3}
Go at you hard, let you know I'm serious
Style's mysterious, got you looking curious
Expose self til you see my insides
6 million ways to try, til you laugh, til you cry
Now breathe, baby, believe, baby, just open up
Get so close, you wonder if it's close enough
I'll whisper to your ear, my dear, let's go there
Tickle your fantasy, there's no control there
I'll hold hair firm in the palm of my hand
To access the net, chit chat to the glance
We brown nosing, slow motion, I'm so focused
Eyes open, close 'em, you got me wide open
I got you wide open, reciprocating your grace
Cling to my mind for balance beyond faith
We ying-yanging, sun-mooning, and so soothing
Out comes the smile in the midst of the fusion
As I...
