[First Verse]
Beautiful woman aged and young alike
Never content with their hair clothes or body type
Vanity insanity caught up with the make up
Natural beauty down while they get the fake up
Treating bodies mean wanna be that girl on that scene
Imitating what they see on magazines
She may look clean but inside it's dirty
Inside they're hurting wound within burning
Resorting to empty relationships and purging
Looking at all the wrong places for what they're searching
Superficial faces on the runway idols
Fashion beauty articles are the bible
The culture making things so the truth in a twirl
Throwing us in a daze making us wanna hurl
Struggles multiply tenfold if youse a girl
Gotta play with hand dealt to better your world

[Chorus]
Yeah, don't need anybody else just yourself to say (way to go)
Yeah, create your own guidelines to them you play (way to go)
Yeah, walk the road not yet taken follow your way (way to go)
Don't need anybody else just yourself to say

Second Verse
Troubles hand in hand with today's young man
Most of us don't know what's up sinking deep in quicksand
Low self esteem contagious like a virus
Not trusting instincts and going wherever the hype is
From the media that's where we get information
Thinking mainstream lifestyle brings salvation
Looks at women with nothing but disrespect
Wants to feel powerful treating them like objects
Little do we know we're media's subjects
Deceived by marketers to reach financial projects
We get one life to play this special game
Though we float like feathers in empty space without aim
Feels empty gap within by drugs and gangs
Only dreams we have include material and fame
Surrendering our lives to false values
Depending on the outside not the inside for truth

[Chorus]

[Third Verse]
That's the end of me tryna' please everybody
Now the water's clean used to be gritty muddy
Unable to see my soul had no worth
Look to others for validation, I don't know what's worse
Didn't know what it was just knew it hurt
Like this painful knot deep within gonna burst
Blind and deaf to my purpose on this Earth
After years of soul searching did I truly come to birth
Fill up with perceptions of others and you be hollow
Character becomes whole when your own way you follow
Question and question the ideas you borrow
Blind acceptance of what's given only brings sorrow
Look to yourself for answers truth is within
Encompass self reliance then your journey will begin
What you think of yourself is what truly matters
At the end of the day we're all climbing different ladders

[Chorus]
