[Verse 1: Chan]

Its hard to maintain "positivity"
When you can't even maintain the daily wage
Sum it up to bang bang

I could smile and say that life is just beautiful
I promise you that with the wink of of my eyelids

Just do what I did
Lay low and act smart
And hopefully
You won't get caught up by kids above you

Maybe then kids will love you
Maybe then kids will kinda care for what you say and what you up to

In the City I appreciate the scenery
The only kind of greenery I see is the weed
The only kind of greenery I see
Is the greenery I never see
Eventually and hopefully

Living in an era with much error
Yet I do nothing about it
Only rap about it

Kinda feeling bad
Its the motion
I'm accepting fact
That my preconceived notions have been serving me well

If they haven't
Then I shouldn't be here
I should be somewhere else
You know where, fill in the blanks yourself

And that's seriously the best advice
That I can give on your life
Do it right
Or do or die

And for all intents and purposes
I don't know what my intensive purpose is
And I'm just blessed to have these dollars I could call my own
And I'm just blessed to be able to go back to a home
And I'm just blessed in that home
That I'm not home alone

And I'm just blessed for a lot of things and that I known
Homegrown, not even goin' grown yet

Not even old enough for cognac
Not even old enough to die yet (2x)
