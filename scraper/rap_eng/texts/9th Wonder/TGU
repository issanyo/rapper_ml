One

[Verse 1: Amar Chong]
Yo I had to prove I was a man and not a mannequin
Posin' in a world, standing still and never panicking
Running from the truth because its damagin'
Took a toke of cannabis, then I turned to Annakin
I'm walking in the skies that my gramps is in
I can feel his smile so my style he's never cramping it
Crushing Krampus's, on the campus
It's the hammer handed bandit, hard headed next philanthropist
Excuse my rambling, I'm gambling, royal flush within the flesh
My soul you can't contest, my soles are rather fresh
So fly like a bird upon a nest, I'm blessed
I'm breaking down the trees just to relieve my stress
I keep my hands clean in the midst of a mess
Let me guess, you call yourself the best?
I spit a piece of a sixteen, and peace is how you rest
Forever more, never less
But nevertheless, whichever way I step, I can't avoid the feel of never ness

(Chorus)
As I reflect, on every single step feeling like the step of death
(DEATH)
But I got no time to rest
(REST)
I still continue on this quest (x2)
As I reflect

[Verse 2: Amar Chong]
I find it funny that you find me funny
Cause funds is all a nigga wanted if we talking money
And I'm adjusting to becoming what I always wanted
Keeping it a hunned, in the Hundreds
And I hunted for my hunneds
Camouflage and I'm blunted
You puffin on a square like the punnett
No pun it's, Amar Marley y'all, blowing strong in a dungeon
The smell is rather pungent
I backs off but I'm fronting
I'm blowing smoke like its out of style
I'm sittin' idle, I'm an outcast watching Idlewild
But I am proud to blow it by the pound
Suddenly it's feeling like I'm living in a cloud
Or a canal
I'm flowing through life like the Nile
But I find a way to smile
Light another L, walk another a mile
And just reflect

(Bridge)
I took 2 to the dome
I took 2 to the dome
Now I'm stoned
So I roam
I'm tryna find my way home
But i took 2 to the dome
I took 2 to the dome
In my zone
I took 2 (x4)
I took 2 to the dome
I took 2...

[Verse 3: Amar Chong]
I look for peace everytime I start to smoke a J
Every toke, hoping that the smoke takes my woes away
It's cold today, in my cul de sac, tryna cultivate
My culture, another stoner feelin' all alone today
Another nigga, puffin through a filter
Tryna find a deeper meaning through these everyday dilemmas
Cause if I choose to drown in a pool full of liquor
Then I never will be found, never been a good swimmer
That's why I'm breakin' down white owl cigarillas
Enter Indica, seal it, then I tilt it to the ember
As I forget what I was told to remember
Then I slip
And I'm gone
