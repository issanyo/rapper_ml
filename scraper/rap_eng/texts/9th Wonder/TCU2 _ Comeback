[Intro]
Yeah

[Verse]
If you can't be honest with me, then you really shouldn't be to your self
Or to the game
But you can have the women, fame, and the wealth
If that really makes you feel better about your self
The attention of intuition
Is killing your self

For real

Lose some, Win some
But I'm still standing
Plan to plan, to plan, is why I'm still planning
But my team never goes to a plan b
We get things done, cause every one plan 3
Really what I'm trying to say is that we far ahead
Focus less on me, & focus more on what is said
This is The Comeback, and this a dumb track
Inhaling marijuana, but I'm exhaling crack
Spitting facts, and building maps
To leave where I'm at
The game know it's real
I see my name on it in tat
People said I had a future, When I was in the past
But I was in the future, I was never in the past
True Love, Crew Love
We go all out
A million ways in the games, But there's no way out
This is what I'm bout, Nigga this The Come Up
2 middle fingers to the side, and 2 thumbs up

And niggas saying that they're lyrist
But I don't really take them serious
I'm killing this hip-hop shit period
The game not trying to miss me like girls on they period
