[Hook: MC David J]
Don't go
I really need you
Matter of fact i'm addicted to you
So in love with you you made my dreams come true
You so cool everything you do feels brand new
So blue (so blue) without you
Oh my god (oh my god) wouldn't know what to do
25/8 you my gift straight from heaven. And I
Got something special for you so just listen

Verse:
I really need you. Like niggas need chicken
Watermelon. So sweet baby listen
My addiction girl I need you every hour
Cause
Every other girl just gives me all the taste of sour
Every time you kick me right in my head
Slap and clapping got me brain dead
I be beating up on you up on reason and don't
Call it a physical abuse cause I really love you
Every day you bring another new rhythm
And the
Amount of dudes tryna do you a million
Hip hop you like the sun and the moon
And if we lost you then the whole world is doomed
Every Time i'm spitting to you girl i'm lifted off my
Feet
Best believe that you the key to my life. My wife
Gotta forgive me i'm on my knees And you the
Only one I love girl i'm beggin you please so

Hook:

Verse 2:
Feelin like a druggy cause I really really need you
Scratch and buggin cause I really really really love you
Swimming in ya pussy girl call me Michael Phelps I
Think I need a doctor someone give me some help (please)
On the desperate shit that clingy shit
If I don't have you then i'm on that suicidal shit
You know that feeling that you gettin when you missin something
So essential to the present got you guessing take a minute
Just breath she is right next to me
So beautiful never ever leave me
Nobody ever makes me feel so free
Without
Weed
Get you high its a garuntee (corny?)
Agree. She rocking with me for life
In the first verse I told you she my wife
Butterflies in my tummy when I touch the mic
Hip hop what a wonderful delight. So
