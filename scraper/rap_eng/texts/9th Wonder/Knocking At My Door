[Intro: Big K.R.I.T.]
They knockin' at the do' again
They knockin' at the do' again
They knockin' at the do' again
They knockin' at the do' again

[Verse 1: Big K.R.I.T.]
See I was raised in the jungle amongst the lions and hunters
When the heat on, niggas beef on in the summer
They think they got a lead on another murder, they just happy
July 4th been gone but them fireworks is cracking
Cause the titans still clashing, I'm trapped but I ain't trapping
Never made much when I did, my partner told me stick to rapping
When you asking for that action, them cameras start flashing
Them mics start recording, and niggas start acting
You gotta play your part while he chopping up that hard
Tired of running down these cars, either this or I'll starve
"Why my windows got bars?" Preparing me for my future
My momma told me slow it down but that shit I ain't used to
These four corner rooms with all the weed that he consumed
Paranoia setting in inhaling all these crack fumes
Pistol by the night stand, all about survival or unexpected arrival
Everybody be quiet

[Chorus]
They knockin' at the do' again
Peeping out the window
Ask 'em who they here fo'
They knockin' at the do' again
Come back 'cause we ain't home
Whoever told you I live here was wrong
They knockin' at the do' again
I don't know you, never seen ya
It ain't my problem that you out here fiendin'
They knockin' at the do' again
They heard I got that blow again
[?]
They knockin' at the do' again

[Verse 2: Jakk Jo]
Man, I'm in too deep
I got bags under my eyes, can't sleep
Going hard with the hard in these concrete streets
They say we trapped in the game, we scratching for change
Price tag on ya head have 'em snatching your brains
This how I'm living
All my partners convicted and still stuck in the trenches
Do' beatin' up off the hinges
I done lost a lot of friendships, seem like the pain is endless
Serving my own people that pure diesel, please forgive us
But I wanted some J's, Impala on them blades
See my uncle hit [?], had him on the floor for days
They knocking at the front do', I'm peeping out the window
It's straps in the trap, six pounds of that endo
Get whacked where I'm at, you can't even trust ya kinfolk
The game so cold served his momma just to get mo'
Grinding from a nickel, working to a dime
Then he flipped it to a quarter now the nigga giving orders

[Chorus: Jakk Jo and Big K.R.I.T.]
Man, they knockin' at the do' again
I'm all out, they tryna score again
Hustle hard, I got dough to get
They knockin' at the do' again
Heard a nigga got it low again
They want that venom from a scorpion
They knockin' at the do' again
Pure white, Hulk Hogan skin
I said they knockin' at the do' again
They knockin' at the do' again
And I can't sleep 'cause I got dough to get
And I can't sleep 'cause I got mo' to get

[Verse 3: David Banner]
Lil' Tommy told me "Banner... if you really at these crackers
Tell these niggas to stop hating and start busting at they masters"
And he told me this, my little sister slipped and slit her wrist
And she ain't even fall, she just laid back and died on the wall
She had a small tear that commandeered the left side of her cheek
But it dried up 'cause they ain't find her body for a week
He said "Banner I know we God, but a nigga tryna eat
So you go back to them beats, I go back to the streets"
We some wolves, we E-A-T, they raw meat
Grabbed a stick from the back of the bus, a slow leak
Gon' speak, get ya ass stomped, no Greek
Or find your body face down in the back of a creek
I ain't playin' wit' you niggas, I ain't playin' wit' a bitch
Look I'm tryna find God in the midst of this shit
Heyyy
Heyyyayyy
Look they knockin' at my do' again
Tell them crackers I ain't goin' in
And if I do then I'm blowin' ten
Bap, bap!
