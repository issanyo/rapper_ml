(Prod. By 9th Wonder)


[Verse 1]
What goes around comes around, don't you get it?
Hard work pays off and you know I'm always wit it
That's the reason that I'm silent and quiet that's why I'm distant
I'm just focused on the millions, that's all so don't get it twisted
Oh he did it, so slick with the bars he spittin'
He gon be the next greatest, I feel that shit in his spirit, yeah
So vivid, the pictures that I be printin'
I'm workin' for real that's why you ain't heard of me in a minute
No competition, ain't nobody with my age and my talent trynna get it
With rage and with my ambition
Shout out to my brothers unjustly held down in prison
Just know that I'm down with all of you niggas to fight the system, yeah
I'm on a mission, I just wanna bless my district
Unable to love, so I just fuck around with some bitches
These niggas party, while me I'm just in the kitchen
Cookin' up music all in the hopes that the world will listen

[Chorus]
Don't you know, I been killin' flows on the low
In the studio, with a pocket full of hope
Don't you know, all a nigga think about is dough
Smoke in my lungs, with a crib full of hoes
Don't you know, I been killin' flows on the low
In the studio, with a pocket full of hope
Don't you know, all a nigga think about is dough
Smoke in my lungs, with a crib full of hoes
Don't you know

{Verse 2}
Yeah, you gotta know that I'm solo, I'm all alone
These people they so cold, I just sit down in my zone
That's why I, don't talk much and I ain't pickin' up my phone
Until I blow, I'm unheard of just keepin' it on the low
Look, I feel depressed, I'm frustrated and always stressed
I've been crossed, stabbed and shot at from some who I thought were friends
It's like they all don't support me, me and my pen
Supportin' trends, I guess it's me, Mauro, Nami and all my plans
Black Pearl, Black Pearl, we takin' over the world
Like Macedon, I'm Alexander The Greatest ready for war
So bring it on, know that we will never fall
Rich or not will bring the heat, and we will always stand tall
Look, this for my mother, who watchin' down from the heavens
When I hit the weed it's like I can feel a vibe of her presence
So when I'm feelin' low, I smoke till my eyes low
And everytime I see her spirit, she tell me I'ma be goat

[Chorus]
Don't you know, I been killin' flows on the low
In the studio, with a pocket full of hope
Don't you know, all a nigga think about is dough
Smoke in my lungs, with a crib full of hoes
Don't you know, I been killin' flows on the low
In the studio, with a pocket full of hope
Don't you know, all a nigga think about is dough
Smoke in my lungs, with a crib full of hoes
Don't you know

[Verse 3]
This chick she asked me, the fuck do I wanna do?
Like how I'ma get food, when my motto is "fuck school"
I told her, no offense and I don't wanna be rude
But them scholars ain't gon get me the shit I want for my crew
Like, I just can't settle for a normal life
And work as a doctor who hates his job workin' over night
I gotta be a multi - millionaire livin' the life
Tourin' with my niggas, catchin' jets all for normal flights
And y'all don't even understand it ain't just about being a rapper
An average nigga who gets forgotten bout 13 years after
Nah, I gotta be like the greatest, the master
One thousand chapters, a life of history all to be captured
So please get out my face, cause I have no time to waste
I gotta lift my spirit up, and get ready for the race, yeah
That money chase, these niggas I gotta wake
Because they sleepin' on the boy, whose throne is his for the take

[Chorus]
Don't you know, I been killin' flows on the low
In the studio, with a pocket full of hope
Don't you know, all a nigga think about is dough
Smoke in my lungs, with a crib full of hoes
Don't you know, I been killin' flows on the low
In the studio, with a pocket full of hope
Don't you know, all a nigga think about is dough
Smoke in my lungs, with a crib full of hoes
Don't you know
