[Verse One]
Cats be screaming on a nigga like they shit ain't stink
Five white boys rapping like they shit N'SYNC
Then they got the nerves to ask me what the fuck I think
You'se a joke here's some cliff notes
Master P video, two tickets to Arsenio, shows over new material
Spectac's superior period, serious
Alpha/Omega/Genesis remember this
I'm the hottest shit to stop south of your border
You need a mouth full of water once my shit drops this quarter
Already got the vinyl on order, ain't even pressed yet
And I ain't trying to stop until I'm rocking off some Jeff shit
For the love of the game, they brought it back where we left it
Hip hop's at a deficit and I'm here to fill that void
You want it, get it Hot Boys, that bling bling kill that noise
Niggas don't rhyme no more, y'all singing chorus's
While I spit the rawest shit to hit since Kane did
Ain't No Half Steppin', y'all cats is brainless
Still famous, but that's alright, the game changes
I'm here to shed light on what a real fucking flow is
I'm out like Chris Tucker motherfucker and you know this

[Hook] {x2}
I'm trying to bring this back if you let me I can
Can you feel this is real?
"And you know this man"
Can you feel this is real?
"And you know this man"
"Who is the man with the master plan?" - Big Daddy Kane 'Mister Cee's Master Plan'
Spectac keep it hot for the love of hip hop

[Verse Two]
If you ain't know about this rap shit, you mad by now
See I done paid dues nigga, even my dad was down
From Melle Mel, The Furious Five to Kurtis Blow
This ain't no shit your ass fast track, I'ma kill you slow
Niggas call me "coke" when I rock, I'ma blow
A household name for real and even your mama know
Once I start to flow you cats will fall like dominos
You wanna know what drama is, I'll show you how that drama go
New season HBO, hip hop's survival show
Put you on an island against me and let you flow for life
Winner of the battle gets respect and a golden mic
Even if you won you'd probably pawn your shit for ice
Stupid
You the reason why we all fucked up
Three words to describe your deal kid, "you lucked up"
And I ain't trying to call you out but you bought your way in
Last call motherfucker what, you thought you staying?
And it seems like the writing and praying is finally paying
Opening doors for me cause I'm here to stay in
Despite what the critics are saying or what you paying them
My flow is still Chronic like Snoop Dogg, Dre and them

[Hook]
