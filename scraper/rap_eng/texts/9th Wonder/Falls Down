[Hook]
It all falls down, all falls down, all falls down
Falls down, when you tryna be somethin' you ain't ready to be
It all falls down, all falls down, all falls down
They love to watch you fall
Swear they love to watch you fall
Tryna be somethin' you ain't ready to be

[Verse 1: GQ]
Boy, I'm from the land of young hookers and sub-woofers
Indiana Jones at a table with bug cookers
On a basket in a river baby the flood took us
Think she a prime rib, not even a fuddruckers
9th told me "with the mic, boy you a muthafucka"
Got a cougar on me cause she heard I'm a muthafucka
A muthafuckin' beast, everything in my house talk
I just feel good like a guest when the couch soft
Never step on stars unless you go to Hollywood
Molecule in my system doin' more than molly would
Most these niggas wack as fuck, they ain't even kinda good
Hall of fame? Nigga you ain't even Harold Miner good
Only pick the phone up if I know her vagina good
Me and bro workin' making sure Asia and China good
Shit, I'm a zombie, I ain't dealing with bath salt
Me and moms chattered, I hope it wasn't our last talk
Before I leave here, or even worse, she do
My best I ain't give it to them, they just got a preview
A buffet of bullshit they gon' feed you
Before they lead you to a snake and then Eve you
Look where I'm at cause how I rap
I see you watchin' but I guess you ain't got time to say congrats
I put my heart and soul in these tracks
Until the day my eyelids collapse
It all falls down nigga

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Problem]
Let's get it poppin', got a [pain?] to fill
You tryna cycle without them trainin' wheels but you ain't ready
The boys with the D but I wasn't heavy
You needed the muscle, shared the hustle yea I wasn't petty
Furious [?] delirious, hella Eddy Murphy the [turfy?]
I'm working, I knew this wasn't my purpose but the perks was fun
Told [?] but didn't burst my gun
Pulled it out once I seen him shook his parka son I'm like fuck that
Mental damn near collapsed on me, relax homie
Realer than the music, y'all rather slap phonies
Bang that but won't bang this huh?
My dance with the devil saw a few of y'all kiss huh
For the fame these lames'll do anything but not me bro
I know my soul is cleaner than a tuxedo fresh out the tailor
I know it's my time, I've lived in this lie like trailers
High baller strangers, do a T.I. son
Man he sure? Hades baby yea more than a pager
More than Adidas, they mourning for me to feed 'em
I will though
Me and [Susie?] in [bad leezy?]
Blowin' kush she uptown with [Bleezy?] talkin' bout how niggas go

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Bad Lucc]
Fly as a pilot drinkin' a Red Bull
[?] random ass verses
Breezy niggas stayed away like churches
I expected more from you niggas, I lost faith in faith itself
When I turned up, I turned wealth
When I turned down you turned to the next man and gave him help
When I got chained I got the bill, I got cute and then I got filled
Groupie asses became [?] for sure though
Back when [?] had the two toed cutlass before though
I been living dreams that I couldn't sell on eBay
Back when I got kicks from East Bay
I'm literally the greatest and they hate it when I say it but believe it
It ain't how many metaphors I stick inside this thesis
It ain't how many bitches know my words to all my singles
It's about the chemistry and how I remind 'em of [?]
I'm a exciting rhyming kid
Me and my constituents blow the dust off the dust
Then get back to our gangsta but naw they tell it
[?] how [?] came through on his [?]
But bird only do business, we ain't doing no copies
Restoring some honour in this genre
Bad Lucc the real life piranha in waters with toads and anacondas
Peelin' gators for gator skins, hustling pimps
Robbing prime for they body type or sell 'em with shrimps or what have you (what?)
None of it's mathematical
Shit ain't that deep, I'm better than more than half of you
99% was [?]
Then me and him go at it so much in the booth I need a job
DOG made him invincible, it's the mob
A nigga need so much millions that I'm a snob
Fuck what you...!
Fuck that shit man, I ain't gotta say no more
I'm better than you niggas
