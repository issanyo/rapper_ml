[Intro: Phonte]
Fly love song, fly love song

[Verse 1: Erykah Badu]
Dream of a land, my soul is from
I hear a hand, stroke on a drum
Shades of delight, cocoa hue
Rich as the night, afro blue

Elegant boy, beautiful girl
Dancing for joy, delicate whirl
Shades of delight cocoa hue
Rich as the night, afro blue

[Hook: Erykah]
Two lovers are face to face with undulating grace
They gently sway and slip away to some secluded place
Shades of delight, cocoa hue
Rich as the night, afro blue

[Verse 2: Phonte]
New Tigallo, New Tigallo
Yo, you came to me as my blessing
I'm trying to accept it and not question
The whys and the hows without ob-sessing
It's a lot to think about, I'm still processing
Tears of joy in the morning made our pillow wet
Then night fell and we turned into silhouettes
Your body next to mine dancing real close
Step left, step right, then a pirouette
It would appear as that we really do believe in us
But it's so hard to believe all we need is us
Believe a kiss on a cold day could be enough
Look at the stars and wonder what it is they see in us
Where is this leading us? That's all I'm asking
Love comes in every color, but the fact is
I never needed Fifty Shades of Grey
Just turn the lights down low and give me every shade of blackness, uh...

[Hook]
Two lovers are face to face with undulating grace
Gently sway and slip away to some secluded place
Shades of delight, cocoa hue
Rich as the night, afro blue
