[Intro] [Chaundon talking]:
Man, I never liked Monday. She was always too stressful for me. Tuesday was cute, Wednesday was the real freak. Hump day. Know what I'm sayin'? Keep in the Rolodex. Thursday, she was fine but I always wanted to jump off for Friday and Saturday. But God introduced me to Sunday. And I knew Sunday was special

[Verse One] [Keisha Shontelle]:
On Sundays
I always
Like to watch the ballgames
And stay all day
Ch-ch-chilling at the park with
A couple of my homies
Watchin' people walkin'
Everybody's talkin', laughin', runnin'
It's funny
Who you bump into when you take the long way
Everybody's hungry
Propane's got the grill smokin'
It feels like a 100
But it's okay
It's lovely (how we) that way (until) Sunday

[Hook] [Keisha Shontelle]:
We at the car wash, trippin'
Got the chrome wheels, spinnin'
Lemonade, we sippin'
All the kids, skippin'
Granny is cookin'
Can't wait till Sunday
Parlay, all day
Sunday

[Verse Two] [Keisha Shontelle]:
The pool is open
Makes me wanna jump in
Call my peeps and they are comin'
It's gon' be on and poppin'
Music's playin', heads are bobbin'
We sippin' on some Kool-Aid
Everything is everything
It's just like the old days
With your family
Celebrate, you work all week, it's time for a break
Kick back and, relax your feet, pass the cornbread
Collard greens and chicken
Stand outside and smell the kitchen
We gon' be dancin' (soon as) you turn on that music

[Chaundon]:
That's when it all goes down
Super Bowl barbeque, friends and family around
God's day off
Six days of puttin' in work
Hear a word from the pastor at the A.M.E. church
It's such a beautify day, I'm dressed to the nines
Walkin' down Fordum Road every lady's a dime
(On Sundays)
I give my momma a call
Let her know I'm doin' alright, no problems at all
(You got your rent paid)
Check
(Your lights on)
Yup
You taught me how to walk so I ain't missin' a step
I'm a grown man now with a bad case of Mondays
Steady reminiscing on a old Easter Sundays
New clothes, hard boiled eggs, Easter baskets
Wishin' I could go back and relive the classics
Oh well, them days are done
But hey, I can't complain there's more Sunday's to come
Ya know?

[Keisha Shontelle]:
Back in the day when I was young, I'm not a kid anymore
But some days I sit and wish I was a kid again
Back in the day when I was young, I'm not a kid anymore
But some days I sit and wish I was a kid again
Back in the day when I was young, I'm not a kid anymore
But some days I sit and wish I was a kid again
Back in the day when I was young, I'm not a kid anymore
But some days I sit and wish I was a kid again

[Hook] [Keisha Shontelle]:
We at the car wash, trippin'
Got the chrome wheels, spinnin'
Lemonade, we sippin'
All the kids, skippin'
Granny is cookin'
Can't wait till Sunday
Parlay, all day
Sunday
