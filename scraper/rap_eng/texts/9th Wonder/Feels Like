[Verse 1: SLPY]

And I... And I And I Don't
Need A Hook Cause The Beat Feels Right
Yea. Yea..
Im Still In The Lead
You Niggas Behind Me
Tryna Catch Up
But They Moving At A Slow Pace
So Im Screaming Out KETCHUP
And We The Best up, I Mean The next up
And Coming
Why Running And Bumping Yur Gums
ANd Not Saying Nothing... Boy
I Gotta Thing For The Mic
It My Love and My Joy And i Pray
And I And I Feel It Like
The Beat Feels Right Like
So Many Thoughts Overflowing I Can't Help But Write
Unc Told Me dream big and just live your life
So I'm doing just that,put my name on the map
Never chilling with lames I'm too cool for that , i mean I swear I'm something different
Nothing Like These Other Guys
Ya'll niggas Ain't Real
I Can See It In Your Eyes
Haters Hate, i dont care so Why Reply
Flying With no wings
You Can Catch Me In The Sky
I Stay Fresh To Death
I Swear Somebody Died
Killing these beats man its a homicide
Yea g up there blazing
Eyes on Asian
And the west is my Location
And you niggas still fucking hating
And im still Like ...
Im still Like...
