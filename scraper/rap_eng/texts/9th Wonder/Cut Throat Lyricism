Verse 1-

I said i'm Ravishing, Ravaging Rap
Averaging damaging stats, Ughh
Bitch i'm snapping
Catch a nigga lacking
Send him back packing
I'm a back pack rap cap fat still snapping
I'm still grasping the bulk of the game
Attached to success like red dots on AK's
Clip full my flow ready to spray
Y'all attached to that ass like shit do when its delayed
Lion senses tingling bout to tear your limbs apart
I'm the king of the jungle been isolated from the start
I'm iller than then flu no cure for my viciousness
Y'all sweet should been named been delicious
No limits im blast through the sky
Intensity on point ain't singing them lullaby's
Hush little baby just adhere to my presence
Your position in this game is irrelevant
Degenerate verses intelligent rhymes
I give em the clockwork they turn orange in due time
Feasting like dinnertime
Complex like paradigms
So attractive got em captive
Just pulled in a pair of dimes
Cap committing crimes
That's lyrical manslaughter
Let me put in fluid terms im Fiji you're tap water
Got the game on my back my shoulders just got broader
Its the Prince Ali Hand me the crown

Hook-

This is cut throat lyricism
Vibe to it though
This is cut throat lyricism

Verse 2-

Let me redirect the lines operator operator
Been working so damn hard opportunity got greater
Despite the scrutiny i truthfully became favorite
Now im setting up a blaze your Super Saiyans cannot save you
Super sayings quote my lines and study my flow
I can twist around the words like politics and Politico
Spit the hardest shit Grizzly Mint never Skoal
In my best K Dot impression bitch im taking control
Slowing your role can you smell what im cooking
Beat you down and rock bottom your ass into the floor
Give you the peoples elbow and pin you down to settle the score
Then ill grim reap your soul leave your corpse burning on coal
Rest in peace nahh rest in pieces
Watch the pendulum swing as cap gains achievements
Your times receding like Lebrons hairline
Use all the Rogaine you want
You still ain't making headlines!
