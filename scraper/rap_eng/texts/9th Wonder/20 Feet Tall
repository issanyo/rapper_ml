[Verse 1]
My love, what did I do
To make you fall, so far from me?
And now, I can't recall
The cause of the fall, selective memory
Then you, you built a wall
A 20 foot wall, so I couldn't see
But if I get off my knees
I might recall, I'm 20 feet tall

[Hook]
Whoa! Hey, I'm 20 feet tall, mmm
Yeah, oh yeah, I'm 20 feet tall

[Verse 2]
My love, what did I do
To make you fall, so far from me?
And now, I can't recall
The cause of the fall, selective memory
Then you, you built a wall
A 20 foot wall, so I couldn't see
But if I get off my knees
I might recall I'm 20 feet tall
