[First Verse]
I know life is crazy it all seems unclear
Feels like trapped in headlights and you a baby deer
But hey, in every problem lies a solution
To avoid the collision you got to keep moving
Things all around got you feeling like you losing
Keep in mind a person can't grow if they just cruising
Growth is in the burn it's most likely your turn
To stand up face your fears and your deepest concerns
Lessons of life may seem a bit too far out
But by jumping in the river you'll know what they're about
Can't do much by standing on the sidelines
Why be a time waster who complains and whines?
I understand the future is uncertain
I say “Live in the now.” You say “That's what hurting!”
Only when you choose to troubles linger
Keep your chin level with a raised middle finger

[Hook 2x]
When I struggle tribulations and trials
I stare life through its eyes with a defiant smile
Life goes on regardless so go figure
Keep your chin level with a raised middle finger

[Second Verse]
Trouble times got your self-esteem so low
This ain't a bad thing but you will always fly solo
We all do, every single one of us
But there's no need to be lonely, if you just
Love and live earnestly to the core not just the crust
With your thoughts and acts you can get to the cusp
Handle with care the situation of trust
Do what you gotta do, whatever you must
Speak your mind sing your pain none can make you hush
Find a healthy outlet to ease the hurt and such
Never let adversity serve as a crutch
Going automatic is lethal grip the clutch
It seems no matter what you try, it's out of control
So you just gotta adapt and go with the flow
Not dead can't quit love instead of anger
Keep your chin level with a raised middle finger

[Hook]
