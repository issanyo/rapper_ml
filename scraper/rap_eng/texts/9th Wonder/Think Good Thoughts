[Verse 1: Malcolm Elliott]

Sleep!

Ayo I found Then
Sweetest love that I ever knew
Counting revenue
That a never do

See I'm not even in my prime
But I'm back with that spark
From my heart or
Am I Tony Stark

Mmm You prolly didn't get it
But it's okay just
Give it a minute
We not the same
You in a scrimmage
I'm the game
Never gon finish

Everything you say is diminished
Boy You a blemish
And I'm Denis the menace
Took yo girl to the dentist

The light
Right Inside of my chest
Gold in the house
We ain't getting no rest

Silver surfer
Out this world
Into our quest

But I finally met a world
Couldn't pass our test

Like that y'all! And it sound so nice
Hip Hop you the love of my life

We finna take it to the top
To the-to the-to the top

We finna take it to the top!

[Hook: Jay Squared]

Like that y'all! And it sound so nice
Hip Hop you the love of my life

We finna take it to the top
To the-to the-to the top
To the-to the-to the top

Aye!


[Verse 2: Jay Squared]

Yo

Maybe this farfetched
But the dog in me
Is done for the day

With them tricks in the park
And toying wit ya heart girl
I just want you to
Come around my way

They said I'm barking up the wrong tree
How?
I been kicking all these freestyles
Since Eustace had a mask
On his face with a big smile

It took a lot of courage
To come and speak and you
But I had to take a break
To get the revenue

My Queen Cleo girl
I hope you understand
That I wanna be way
More than just your man

And

Victoria I'm sorry
For the trouble they caused
But I'd be honoured if
You picked up my call

Cause baby we can watch
The boats go by while
We just chilling in the park, uh
Roll a L a light and I hope
You down to spark, uh

Up this Ganja, uh
Rose pedal walking
Sheba had her talking
Which is better take over or either

While kicking vivid pictures
In your eardrums
And I'm not gonna start rapping
Till the day comes

You gotta understand
That this is my one shot
Don't ever think I wanna
Play ya facade because I'm the liaison

Bigger than Faizon
Love drug definite
You must been heaven sent
I prophesies on us together

When you were dealing with medicine
You must of saw what I saw
I tried to talk to you
But you left me there with lock jaw

Damn

[Hook]

[Verse 3: G. King]

Aye

I just need rhyming for my reasons
A reason for my rhyme
No passing time
I give no lenience

Good evening welcome to the
Project you been waiting on
I leave a 9th Wonder beat
Deceased so only 8 was known

I love this game that's plane
So don't complain just
Change the thrown
Now rainy stains are paying off
Sustained the game I'm
Taking off like plains

So kindly leave the cockpit
Concocting a doctrine that's
Constant wit ya conscience
I'm just

Getting started to reach ya soul
Pray we never departed but
To each his own
I'm rapping to achieve a goal

Drafts from my memory
Could change the whole landscape
My mandate and campaigns
I'm bouta take his fans away

I pray this rapping and school
Adding with ease while
I get my two degrees
Remember me before I leave

For the keys that unlock ya ki
Ya Chakra seeds then sprout
And sow leaves the doubting
For new years eve dog

[Hook]


[Verse 4: Kera]

Check

I said 16 hoping to put my life in it
I was 'bout 13 when I started writing it
Putting words together
Like I'm typing it

I rap for the ones with a vision
And if they can't see mine
I hope they listen
I'm like a chevy with the hubcap missing

Straight ghetto
Kera you the truth Ma-Ma
Kind words from a wise fellow
Somewhere down the line

P-people started crossing it
It's becoming less rap
More politics we
Need less of that

More hieroglyphs
Screaming '94 till
Till these four doors ain't four doors
That's a Ford Taurus

With expired tags
Using what we got to get
What we never had
In Detroit on the westside

Tryna see where Malcolm at
Prolly somewhere changing the world
That's why we call him Malcolm X

With a dream like I'm martin luther
Hoping this music get me places
Like a harvard student

Feel me?
