[Intro]
Yeah, back up in this
Yeah, Strange Fruit Project
Bringin' a little somethin' special on this one
Come on, 9th Wonder on the beat

[Verse 1: Symbolyc One]
Packing my bags ,  cause a brother wanna roll again
Maybe we can do this another time but I'm rowin' in
Start my motor man , I'm bout to head out
Say a little pray for myself and the I sped out
Thoughts on my family It got me hesitating now
Thoughts of insanity It got me meditating loud
Insane anger , brothers headin' for danger
Looking at my life shit is straight dangerous
It's all good, small hood, slang the dust
Another brother wanna aim and bust
So, Im out the hood and I'm living in the better city
Cause things go round like marry go  so let it go
It's getting gritty , wonderin'  where the crime went
Locked up, encarcelated, most of the time spent
Behind bars I rhyme bars if neccesary
Sort of scary how I be livin' , dwellin' in the cementery
So special ....

[Hook]
This feeling in me has got to be
(Something more than special)
I can feel all in my bones
Won't let me alone
It just goes on and on

This feeling in me has got to be
(Something more than special)
Is all in my soul
It won't let me go
It just goes on and on

[Verse 2]
First of all I thank god for my life
Shouting out to both mommas for addressing the stresses
Of wrong and right , when the pressure was on
Discipline , was giving and getting in the zone
To get it while the getting is good instead of getting it on
So I let it be known , from suburbs
To the inner city gritty [?]
She living on curbs
Many a lyrical slur
Plug it in and appease the masses
Music got that [?] for more
Like please pass it
We breeze past the past now we classic
Beyond y'all platinum plaques and shrink wrapping
Made it 9 miles without Rabbit
Mad when the run around getting rerun what's happening?
The locks getting popped on the door of the industry
Cause you were on the bill and wasn't bringing no energy
Now we [?] like synergy
Remedy for the times when an artist lacking in rhymes
So I figure that I'm...

[Hook]
This feeling in me has got to be
(Something more than special)
I can feel all in my bones
Won't let me alone
It just goes on and on

This feeling in me has got to be
(Something more than special)
It's all in my soul
Won't let me go
It just foes on and on

[Verse 3]
Sit back , relax and watch me spit the rhymes like the [?]
Rather spit on the mic than keep my lips on the bottle
In a hostile environment , a brother keep trying
Surrounded by relative fossils of classic music
Got the youngest  ask [?]
The old  school , I'm from the 70s
Baby , making music , got these cats telling me
It's cool but nothing special
Nothing next level
So I laugh it off , crack a smile , times have changed
Yo it's been a while since my brain
Been stimulated , musically penetrating my soul
Send a shiver down my spine
Reason for the rhyme
To relax the mind , like giving sight to the blind
I put the world in a bind , the unsigned hype
Now I sign autographs , all day and all night
Keep them haters out my sight
Got nothing but love
And my skills shine bright
Make the world feel special when I'm rocking the mic

[Hook]
This feeling in me has got to be
(Something more than special)
I can feel all in my bones
Won't let me alone
It just goes on and on

This feeling in me has got to be
(Something more than special)
It's all in my soul
Won't let me go
It just goes on and on

[Outro]
Yo
Gotta let y'all know we comin' with something special for show
Shout out to 9th Wonder , man for this lovely track
Nahmean?
This Hip Hop gonna be something tight
If you treat it right
Playing and stuff on the mic like it's nothing
This feeling is something real
Don't play with it
(something more than special)
Peace to all the fam , Black Sun , Verbal Sea , SFP
Deloach , free agent , Kaotix foundation
And anybody who copped this album
It's for y'all
Try to make it something special
