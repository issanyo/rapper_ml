[Verse 1: Lecrae]
I've been treating this part of life like a dance floor
Side stepping all the things I've made plans for
And I ain't acting when I'm taking on a man's role
Chance to enhance the fam can be a handful
I rather have my hands full than be empty-handed
Travel all around the planets till I have it planted
Firm roots like great grand pap, married 65 years, 20 kids, same family
Strong as an ox and I'm from the same stock
So I won't be hanging out 'till I see the sun-o'clock
It's been a long time coming but I'm coming at a decent hour
Everything I have is ours start the wedding shower
Teeball games in the summer ballet in the winter
And I ain't scrolling through my twitter while we having dinner
Time to grow up, done drinkin I throw up
Neglected little man from my plans, try'n to blow up
Some people are so focused on the road to success
They don't see their whole family laying dead on the tracks
I rather cease to have my lyrics read over tracks
And put some family photos on the walls instead of plaques

[Interlude: Swoope]
It's been a long time coming, but we're here now
Unashamed

[Verse 2: Swoope]
Look
I remember watching videos by Hype Will
Thinking I could do that if I had a nice deal
But the precedent is MC's dead believe
They take the same exit that Mason Betha did
Cause when you're talking steal then ya sound hard
But they let you out ya deal when you found God
Back to watching Hype Will, think about how I feel
Wishin spitting Christian wasn't God's will
It's been a long time running, long time wondering
Long time humming stupid songs that I hated
From a rapper that I felt was overrated
Cause I knew that he was faking but he everybody's favorite
Coming with that same hi hat and 808 hit
Bricks that they weight lift, chicks that is naked
I'm in my house studyin' the scripts that is sacred
If this a success recipe I ain't gonna make it
So many reasons not to
I only graduated high school
I'm from a small little city that they fly through but never fly to
Just a plain town tryin' to be fly too
Ak-town rapper, we backed down never
So I'm finna to take my hood up like Trayvon
Finna hold my hood down like your favorite mob
Finna mix some hood nouns with the Pharaoh Monch
Walking with the King, boy, watch the Pharaoh march
Red Sea is my favorite part
The Lord opened up a new avenue
Industry got the wrong awards and we passin through
Church clothes on the mic spitting what your pastor do
Looking at the world through our Master's view
Offer you the optic codes, keep this glasses, too
On fire for the king, but we're cold rappers, dude
It's been a long time coming
