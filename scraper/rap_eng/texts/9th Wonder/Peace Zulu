[Produced By: 9th Wonder]

[Intro: 9thmatic]
Peace to Universal Zulu Nation
Shouts out to Afrika Bambaataa, Q-Tip
DJ Mark Love
Yup

[Hook: 9thmatic]
We say "peace", and still talk that street
Walk like a man like your pops tried to teach
Talk that slang, march like King
Z's up with the nation of [length?]
It go "peace", and still talk that street
Walk like a man like your pops tried to teach
Talk that slang, march like King
It's the Zulu Nation

[Verse 1: Enigma]
Check, some say the black man is God
Black clutch your fist that black man strong
After all [?] fasted it, I'm trained
Walk tall among everything still [?] let my freedom reign
Huh, need a litre like King
So meet a speaker like E, I need a speaker to breathe
The sweetest thing, holding pieces of a dream
Hoping, words spoken won't fall on deaf ears
Model me after my peers, provoke us
We gotcha, we gotcha no problem and shout to Bambaataa it's nada
Optional stop [?]
Rhyming with time and we blind 'em and [?] and shine up
Rocking that red, black and green piece
The [Al-Raheem?] of rap G is fellow me exactly
Ya highly within my psyche
I walk lightly and talk slightly under my level until I'm [?]
Despite me, as usual, yes, black is beautiful

[Verse 2: Sundown]
It go arm-leg-leg-arm-head
Mixed verses from the bible that I read, now I regulate my daily bread
Make it swing like the gun clappers knocking my apocalypse drums
Dum-dums lookin' dumbfounded
Stop it, we got it locked from the bottom
To the mountaintop scream, bring the avalanche warning shots
2011, now twenty take eleven make nine
Mathematician with the one to rhyme
I'm in the zone, hit [?]
Say we hit a lick, spit, lickity split
Lick the spoon from the kitchen when I'm cookin' shit
True grit from the flip then they turn ten back into five percent
And turn the page, we engaged like them rings on the third digit
Dig it, so what's the math in it? Do the numbers brotha
Cosigned from 9th Wonder, rep the culture
Put a fist up and hold the vultures
They pick apart art with no hunger and so we never slumber
And hold your ground so they never plunder

[Verse 3: HaLo]
I'm stuck for a [?] in the booth baby paw
I [?] so smooth with the jab
Won't spend a dolla, save every buck
'Til I purchase the sphinx and fix the nose cut
Walk with a cold strut, used to post up
Actions speak, I don't brag and boast up
Run with a chosen crew chosen few most [?]
Find out when they [?] close cut
Turn when I stare like the Mario ghost
Think I married the most beautiful thing in the world
Keep my girl music laced in diamonds and pearls
Game unfurls right in front of my eyes
Real recognize real and I see a disguise
Elephants in the room and Dumbo fly
Talkin' jibberish mumbo jumbo fly
Nervous hellos and the happy goodbye
So fly

[Hook]
