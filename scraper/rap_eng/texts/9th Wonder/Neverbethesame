Anonymous with the ominous flow
That has achieved dominance
Over the somnolence that is
Your flows, they're softened
I off them
And put them in a coffin
So often
Better take caution
I'm ill with the skills that kill
That'll soon pay the bills
And not the ones that stand on Capitol Hill
This ain't Schoolhouse Rock
But my knowledge is power
With lyrical showers
Over you delicate flowers
In my garden
Pardon
My flow will still harden
This is lyrical sparring
You funny style like Martin
Lawrence, to my hundred percent abhorrence
Most of your style is lazier than that maid Florence
I'm moving on up like a Jefferson
A newcomer, but I rhyme like a veteran
I'm getting ill
Someone provide the medicine
Rapping is my sport
You can call me a letterman
Not talking about jackets
But the fact is
You need practice
Because you lack this
Effort that's made me so much better
The style's more clever
Hotter than pepper
I'm a ghost with the flow
Never boast with the flow
I should have a cookout the way I roast with the flow
Like a host with a show
I am proud to present
The emcee that's known to represent
His hometown, that's me
A-R-K-H-I-T
E-K-T, with the flow that's crazy
Might stick to you like glue
Making his debut
Flowing like the old greats used to
I'll never be the same
Because of this rap game
It's a shame
You'll never remember my name
But you will soon
I rep Wilson
It's real, son
My style is fresh and yours is jading/Jaden like Will's son
This is something you can feel, son
A hundred more rhymes in store, ready to kill, son
Machine gun rap influenced by the boom bap
Got eight letters for you: it's a wrap!
