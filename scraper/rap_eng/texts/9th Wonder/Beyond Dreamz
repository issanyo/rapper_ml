Give you a little bit of the flavour
You know what it is man, Black Pearl nigga
Beyond Dreamz

[Verse]
Beyond Dreamz, the future black king
The current black kid, with money plots and schemes
A nigga wanna fly, so I gotta grow wings
Fly high, so high, cop me all them diamond rings
I’m on the road to riches, fuck a wish list
I don’t wish for shit, I work for shit that’s how the shit is
I got that money talk, I got that money walk
I’ma monster, I got these nice fly saucy bars
I know you see me right, mastering the life
Everywhere I go the center of attention of the night
I ain’t even famous, there’s just something special to me ight
Shit imagine when I’m rich and famous, probably own the lights man
Damn Devon why quit and shit?
I thought you was a rapper, why you ain’t releasin' no shit?
Nigga shut the fuck up, a million and one questions
I don’t need that shit, I don’t need no fuckin' lecture
I’m just layin' low, gettin' high ya dig
Ridin' round with my niggas, and fuckin'em curvy chicks, ahh!
Dog you know a nigga real
Word is bond, I cannot go down without 100 mil
Nigga, I'ma lil boss livin' for the thrill
Lil nigga, big words, giant actions that’s my deal, uh
I spit flows that will mentally disturb you
You’ll say this is impossible this kid spits like a mogul
Seventeen with a pocket full of dreams, plant seeds, money trees
That’s some shit I gotta see nigga
That's all me nigga, don’t fuck with me
Spit hot fire flows make you niggas be deceased, man
And Black Pearl is the movement
Black Pearl records start with nothing but the music
Niggas doubting me, they assumin' I can't do it
So when I do, do it they gon find that shit amusing, uh
Not me tho, I knew it from the start
I just keep it to myself, I don’t really like to talk
Moving silent, quiet work that shit really pays off
I don’t take orders from nobody, I gots to be the boss, I'm the boss! ...
Yeah nigga I’m the boss, and these shawtys wanna fuck cause they know I got the sauce
So I fuck 'em hard, they give me head till I ball
All up in my ear talkin' bout how they in love
Naa girl, you know my motives
You know all I wanna do is get that pussy open
You know I just wanna have fun and connect
I don’t wanna cuff you baby, I thought you knew we just ballin'
Low key shawty don’t tell no one what we do
All that smooth shit It can't never leave that room
For real, tell these niggas what’s the deal
I don’t need a paper deal, just to get 100 mil
I'ma do it by myself, I'ma do it with the real
Beyond Dreamz motherfucker, you niggas just need to chill
Yea, for real
Beyond Dreamz mothafucker
