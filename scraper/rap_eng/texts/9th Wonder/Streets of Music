[Hook: Von Pea]
I said it’s a wonderful year
I said it’s a wonderful year

[Verse 1: Von Pea]
Here we go, ugh
Young enough for iPods, old enough for Walkmen
Too young for park jams
By the time I came they sealed street lamps
No more of that vibe
But everywhere I went, they would still rap, I
Grew up in Bed-Stuy, real life Mookie
Listening to “Buggin’ Out,” walkin' past Pookie’s
I guess it helps build character
Older guys listening to Kane, talkin' Africa
“Smooth Operator,” Cee on the fader
Cee led to B.I.G. and you know what came later
You wanna talk music in the streets?
Imagine “Hypnotize” blastin' as his body was carried through Bed-Stuy
Diddy had Ma$e and the cops did too
Pepper spray during our brother’s parade
We just wanted to send him off properly and thank him
Music our outer sanctum, it’s a wonderful year

[Hook: Von Pea]
I said it’s a wonderful year
I said it’s a wonderful--

[Verse 2: Donwill]
Fell in love face first when I heard Kane’s verse
Maybe it was Todd Shaw, life is Too $hort
Sounds like it cuz it made life matter
Man the music in them streets, made a lot of moments magic
Like the first song you played when you got the L’s
I was probabaly bumpin' Ant Banks or Quik myself
In my mom’s whip, frontin' tryna get at some girls
House speakers in the hatchback, the shit sounded terrible
I'm form Ohio so when Bone Thugs dropped
Slid that in the deck right next to Pac
Then I moved to Carolina when that Outkast dropped
And blew big weed bumpin' CNN and Nas, but
Now I'm in the Stuy where they set up shop
Pull the sound system out and yellow tape the block
They can hate it online, but if the streets say go
Off of Kenwood spins you’d be ghetto gold
Yo!

[Hook: Von Pea]
I said it’s a wonderful year
I said it’s a wonderful year

[Verse 3: Enigma]
Yo, yo, check
Music in the park, that pure art
The year marks the real, for real
Pac and B.I.G. in that stereo shit
Poppin' wheelies to the sounds to the Illadelph
Halflife roots to the past, they feel it past, get mad hyped
Hear that Nas then they act right
Boom bap raps, like comin' from the back of the Acc
Them Wu tracks had us breakin' our necks
Kept them haters in check
Kept them tapes in the deck
Man we played em to def, had mad flavor
Before swag, you heard the urge to stack paper
Major game players, the fame made em some mainstayers
Then we zone out
Old heads told us to turn it down
Had a couple of lame neighbors saying we run it loud
They shut it down, never that, ever that
Still bumpin' hella tracks
Lil flavor for your ears to get that feelin' back
Let’s go

[Hook: Von Pea]
I said it’s a wonderful year
I said it’s a wonderful year
I said it’s a wonderful year
I said it’s a wonderful year
