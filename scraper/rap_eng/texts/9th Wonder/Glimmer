[Young Gliss]
[A glim in her?] success is what I vision
Some shoes that I can't yet fit in
[But/ they?] it's going to happen in time though
But the way I see it, we ain't got much time though
So, I'm never stopping, so never write me off
I hear them haters in the back but I brush them off
I guess it's just apart of the process
I know me winning something hard to digest
But you gotta deal with it
They can't stand me, I'm Manny, so left field with it
With a vibe that the ladies feel, without a club hit I hook 'em still
Smoking grand daddy purp', fogging up the wheel
With a model chick with me only for the thrills
She not a dime, but uh, she'll fit the bill
Cat walking through the mall, watch them hoes hate (hoes hate)
You know they want your spot, you better stay in shape
Cold bastard, that's what my mama told me
Trust me baby, you don't wanna see the old me
Top down, riding through the city
Big B's on that wheel, looking oh so pretty
And that's a good look, ain't it
My minds [clouded?] with smoke, my [past?] so jaded
I feel I'm underrated and
I'm just trying to just make it to the top of niggas' play list
From the hated to the favorite
And that's a mission in itself
'Cause nigggas will give you a deal to sit you on the shelf
Jock you're whole swag, while you under they belt
Then they'll treat you like a son when you try and speak out
That's why I do this shit for myself
Turn the Pro Tools on, put my blunt in my mouth and zone out
Give you exactly what I'm thinking about, that's me, real shit no gimmick
Soaring through the skies, 'cause I don't see a limit
Dropping hits nonstop while you working on your image
Making whack dance tracks, after that man it's finished
My nigga told me does you really wanna rise?
[Grab a down south beat, and slowly ride the tide?]
I told him naw man homie, I'm a man with pride
'Cause it's easy to be Gucci Man, it's harder to be Nas
Yeah, and that's a word from the wise
It's Young Gliss, nigga
