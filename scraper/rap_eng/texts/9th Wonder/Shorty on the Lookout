[Intro: Skeeter Mack aka 9th Wonder]
Yes sir oh we got coming up like I said
Shorty on the lookout featuring that bad man median
(shorty hit the brakes too late)
Uh from justus league WJLR BAM! (shorty hit the brakes too late)
The future of hip hop music

Shorty hit the brakes too late
Shorty hit the brakes too late
Shorty hit the brakes too late

[Verse 1]

[Phonte]
Hey yo rollin out the crib about a quarter to six
Fresh Timbs, bubble goose all in the mix
Y'all niggas know my steez and how crazy I get
I'm looking for the broad shaking ass and tits
I got the J League banging hard out the whip
Picked up the phone and hit my nigga Pooh on his hip

[Big Pooh]
I got the call from 'Te about a quarter to eight
Don't about y'all niggas but I sure look great
I went to change that's how I meet in place
There go 'Te and all damn he always late
Hopped in the whip it's the League's new shit
What up with this chicks yo I'm trying to hit

[Phonte]
Hey yo these chicks around here ain't tryna give me no play
They mad at my verse from Whatever You Say
Yo sorry about the shirt I'll hit you with pay
You still rocking that punch from the video day
We 'bout to take it over to where Median stay
Just bounce to the beat bounce, rock and sway

[Hook: Phonte, Big Pooh, & Median]
Shorty hit the brakes too late
[P:] Looking at me cause I am just keeping it thorough
Shorty hit the brakes too late
[BP:] We shining bright for every man, child, woman and girl
[P:] To my man's in it (c'mon) and my peep's in it (c'mon)
And my girls in it (c'mon) put your world in it (oohhh)

Shorty hit the brakes too late
[BP:] Looking at us cause we on top of the world
Shorty hit the brakes too late
[P:] And every state, every city, every town and girl
[M:] And to my freaks in it (c'mon) and the fam in it (c'mon)
And the ladies in it (c'mon) it's all gravy in it (oohhh)

[Verse 2]

[Phonte]
Hey that nigga Median ain't never at home
He trying to be a player like Romey Rome
Probably at a coffee shop trying to bone
Gassing up these chicks like Sharon Stone
Got these young broads thinking that they grown
Nigga need to go and get a cellular phone

[Big Pooh]
'Te I seen him at a party just last week
He had around his arm a little dark skin freak
MC on the tables on the mic unique
Broads around Median trying to speak
I guess that's the life walking the his shoes
All we need now is a dutch and a brew

[Median]
It's mid-December in here
Seventy degrees and the skies are clear
Feel's so good like Davina in here
Do them stars and them stripes mean the ending is near
No time got evicted got a crib to clear
Move on don't stop house parties and all
And we going to ball 'til the break of dawn

[Hook]

[Verse 3]

[Big Pooh]
Man where you been we tryna lay this jam
All we here is songs the invisible man
Girls they go hard get giddy and stuff
That's why we want you we ain't pretty enough
To the Nissan we going to lay these plans
Next week we record it at missy yan's

[Median]
Probably think I be playing with this
I can hear them niggas Pooh and Phonte in this shit
If only they could know a brother holding it down
Grinding for the day that we controlling it now
To the break of dawn, to the break of dawn
Flow's hot just open up your mind baby
The blind lead the blind make the grind crazy
Why maybe just co-signed baby
Median would like to know your mind baby
J Lizzy is about to blow your mind baby
Lunch time, crunch time, punch line baby
Our time now what is that a crime now baby

[Hook]
