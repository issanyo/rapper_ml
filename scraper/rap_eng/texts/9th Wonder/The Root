[Intro:]
Yeah, yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
Yeah, yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
Get the money, dollar dollar bill y'all
Said cash rules everything around me, C.R.E.A.M

[Verse:]
Hand in my pocket coming up with lint
And I ain't even putting up for rent
Some of us running off the funding from the government
Struggle putting hours in but still we need a supplement
I been busy planning on planting myself a money tree
I know its not the answer to all of of my problems, but the way I see it helping it would have me living comfortably
I gotta chase it cause it ain't just gonna come to me
Anxious on the run and I been hunting for more
I'm thinking money galore, like my money touching the ceiling when it come from the floor
I know some people trapping but I never done it before
Because I didn't wanna ever have to run from the law
For more money, what some of us would do is so ugly
I know I wanna fill up banks but don't judge me
How do this cheddar always got me feeling better?
Gotta hustle for more than ever, so that I can go ahead to let the..

[Hook:]

So we can go ahead and let the..
(Sample:) let the dollar circulate
Just another day dollar
We gotta hustle harder, stack it up until we notice that we gotta let the..
(Sample:) let the dollar circulate
So we can go ahead and let the..
(Sample:) let the dollar circulate
For all my people that be hustling and following the green
With some lint up in your pockets and a dollar and a dream

[Verse:]
I've gotten older now the stress is real
When I was young my mother used to stress us leaving on the lights around the house so she could make sure she would save on the electric bill
I'm still around the house so I ain't independent less you talking bout the fact that I haven't gotten a record deal
Never will I let desire for the money turn me to some sort of tyrant for the money
Who be wilin' for the money, this concrete jungle got some humble cats turning into lions for the money
Folks dying over money, we be dying for the money
The hustlers be flooding streets narcotic supplying for the money
They even gripping the iron for the money, getting violent for the money
In the courthouse on trial over money
Long story short, it gets wild over money
But to eat I'm gonna do what I gotta
They say accumulate dollars and then Hakuna Matata

[Hook]

[Bridge:]
Cash rules everything around me, C.R.E.A.M
Get the money, dollar dollar bill y'all (3x)
Dollar dollar bill y'all
