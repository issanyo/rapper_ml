[Verse 1: RiccDogg]
What if, rap wasn't for me, I had no ways to tell me stories
Writing scriptures and pictures for bitches somehow got boring
The excitement that I had for flash had left when I went touring
I soon seen a difference, when I awaken each morning
I televise my images, to let go the struggle
Hour visits to most prisons, left to father I love you
But I will not take steps to toward your steps, I just want you to know
I found a cope and that shall find my place to go
Through times of need, when I had needed things to know
I took a lost, and I was left too long alone
See now this dedication left long when I just got comfortable
But what is relaxing, or taking your time, when you just have too much to do
I wish that I could find a place to go go, find a place to go
An maybe there I'll see a face I know know


[Verse 2: Ant]
Have ya ever been doing something, not halfway but all in
Cutting off all ya close friends and loved ones to focus
Dedication, dedicated, cause that's what it takes to make it
But what if, it ain't worth it, and all of ya time was wasted
What if what you do ain't for you, and the thing you love is spoiled
And rotten, hot/got damn, it's too late and your boxed in
Made lifetime decisions, even loss your future mistress
For this shit, too much pride to just quit, came too far to go backwards
So you proceed, they say have a plan b
But I believe, plan b distracts, and holds you back from ya real dream
But that's just me, and I'm half crazy
When it come down to this music I'm pursuing at least
Have ya ever been something, cause it look cool, tryna fit in
I'm sure you have, cause we've all been, in that position
But listen, to that feeling in ya gut
And remember no matter what you do your never stuck
