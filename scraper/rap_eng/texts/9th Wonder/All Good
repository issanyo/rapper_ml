[Verse 1: Joey Fatts]
Money matters, cause it’s over all
For that cash, boy, I’m strapped like some overalls
Standin’ on the corner tryna get this yola off
And I’m makin’ cheese so the beef just a burger dog
Getting worked off, everyday trappin’
Quarters got low so when niggas start rappin’
Niggas outta line, forty-five toe taggin’
Know I’m blessed, still bought another semi-automatic
And if it start clappin’ niggas catching bodies
Every night antoher homi on my side of town
Gettin’ money so these hoes tryna kick it now
Didn’t wanna drop a hundred bet she’s with it now, bitch is foul
But I’m just doin’ me, still keep it G
Why? Cause I’m the same O.G. from the east
In the streets nigga still hug the block
And if I ain’t there I’m probly runnin’ me a spot
Where the guap, with the Glock, niggas chippin’ non-stop
Make the wrong move then your ass gettin’ shot
Still slingin’ rocks I’ll probly never leave the hood
But even if I could I don’t think a nigga would
Cause everything is all good

[Hook: Joey Fatts]
Everything’s all good, nigga
Don’t worry everything’s all good
All good, all good, everything’s all good
All good, all good, everything’s all good

[Verse 2: Joey Fatts]
Let’s make a toast to better days
Used to move work in the set now we paid crushin’ the stage
Spendin’ rent money on fancy dinner plates
Probly clean out your bank account with these dinner rates
I been down and out but momma birthed a soldier
I was a little wheezy, but now the drought is over
Been paper chasin’ since diapers, niggas I skipped the stroller
Used to dream of Testarossas now we gettin’ chauffeured
Used to be priced with pussy now they throwin’ me chocha
First I fuck, grab my stuff again it’s buenas noches
Used to push 36 like [?]
Had a key for every door so I knew how to manage
Now it’s moppin’ floors, automatics in the attics and clips
Long as antennas for niggas bout static, yea
Baby, leave your seat and fuck with a low
And nigga act like you been here before
Let’s make a toast

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Rapsody]
Welcome to Earth
I put pills in your applesauce
We never ever ask where the apple’s from
I like my drums hella hard, soundin’ ignorant
Woke up this mornin’ hella early laughin’ at the sun
We can shine too like you son ain’t the only one
For what it’s worth I appreciate a bad outcome
I appreciate all my friends that’s out there, tell me somethin’
Like you the one we been waiting for, all the rest are frontin’
And if it only lasts for a spur of a moment, hope it’s Duncan
Catch the melody, homie told me I’m on to somethin’
Tomorrow it’s the movie star track
I’m in the car tryna catch a charge from all my contacts
Phone died and I’m feelin’ low as battery acid
And it hurt sometimes but I still gotta mask it
Readin’ all my thoughts and I’m feelin’ like trash
And what’s crazy is compared to yours I’m still fantastic
On top of the world and I’m still under it
Don’t mistake the sunny days cause I’m still thunderin’

[Hook]
