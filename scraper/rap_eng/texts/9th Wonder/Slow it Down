This some grown man shit right here
Listen

[Rapper Big Pooh]
I'm trying to man up see whats really good with you
Gentleman's approach, not bring it hood to you
Same things that you hear everyday like
"Hey ma, hey boo, baby whats your name"
Please pull up a seat, I'm so glad you came
My mother call me Thomas you can do the same
Damn its so refreshing when you calling out my name
Been Pooh for so long it doesn't sound the same
My occupation rap and I make a little change
I see you not impressed with what this life brings
Finished school, got a job, girl do your thing
It's a lot of independent women wanna be claimed
Marry into money or marry into fame, or at least give birth to a check
WIth all due respect lets two-step in the name of like
Who says we gotta do the waltz all day and all night, it's like

[Hook]
If love is not enough
We don't have to rush
Come around, I'll slow it down just for you
Lady you should be
Right here next to me
Come around, I'll slow it down just for you

[Rapper Big Pooh]
We can go to the movies
I'll take you to the park and promise to have you home before the lights go out
Steady asking you questions what your life about
Oh and me, mine's everything I scribe about
No doubt this my life and
Dedicated to this witting sacrificing everything for it
Wasted time I can't afford
So if it ain't you/then you know I'm cooped up to record

[Phonte]
I'll scoop you up in me Porsche, sike
You know I got a Nissan
That I'm still paying for, still got a lease on
But it don't matter cause that ain't my aim to get you
I got fame, but you know that just ain't the issue
Because you're looking like a woman of virtue
So well-rounded, no wonder your're in my circle
And normally you probably wouldn't give me the time of day
Cause Tay got rhymes, but no he ain't got time to waste

[Hook]

[Phonte]
Sometimes I think I'm from another world
When I'm trynna tell a woman just exactly where I stand that
I want a girl, when I want a girl
And when I don't want a girl
I want a girl who understands that
And that's some hard shit to explain
To a woman that's in love with you
It's a pitiful thing
Until I had to figure
That I don't wanna play around
But I don't wanna settle down
And that's a man's dilemma
Cause every man remembers
How his Daddy and his Uncles did it
Cause more than likely that's the way they're gonna do it
I know it sound fucked up and most won't admit it
But yo, I gotta face it cause I know I'm living through it
Cause when the party stops and niggas get old
And the chain and the cars and the houses get sold
And that
Other side of the bed gets cold
You don't wanna be alone
So girl I'm trynna hold you

[Hook]

[Vamp Out]
Ohhh baby
Take it slow
Take it slow, take it slow, take it slow)
What you need to do is
Take it slow with me
Slow it down a little bit
Take it slow, take it slow, take it slow, take it slow
We don't have to rush into anything serious
Take it slow, take it slow, take it slow, take it slow
No we don't, take it from me
Take it slow, take it slow, take it slow, take it slow
My name is Percy
And I make miracles if you take it slow with me baby
Take it slow, take it slow, take it slow, take it slow
