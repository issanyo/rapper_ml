[Intro: Smif-n-Wessun]
Smif-n-Wessun on the borderline
Smif-n-Wessun on the joint one time
Yeah
Smif-n-Wessun on the borderline
Smif-n-Wessun on the joint one time
Maybach Music

[Verse 1: Smif-n-Wessun]
Yeah
This some jewels from my main man
Never start anything without a game plan
Niggas dappy then daggin' you with the same hand
I'm on my rappin' shit, trappin' chips with the same fam
We 'bout bands no counterfeit in the name brand


[Verse 2: Rick Ross & Smif-n-Wessun]
[?] and success, I pray your soul just takin' over
When I need the protection that's when pray the most
Three attempts on my life, tonight out here maybe the fourth
In the one that I drive [?] I had to pay the cost
Hate [?] on them bitches, we come to lay the love
Bitch niggas be scared to get their makeup ruin
Reasons we stepped into him, still in their dressing room
He turns the revenues savage come with their weapons drawn
They know we richer than them snitch niggas could ever known
Passports and bitches call 'em private affairs
J Prince got an island who's playin' Simon Says?
Too on top of this money got be out on a leash
[?] told 'em it was me
Tell 'em boss
I told them bitches it was me

[Chorus: Rick Ross & Smif-n-Wessun]
Twenty whips I find a way to utilize (I shine, you shine)
On a Tuesday night you come and get that super fire (I shine, you shine)
If my life was a movie we'd call it "Superfly" (I shine, you shine)
Sixty million on the low and nigga who am I? (I shine, you shine)
Lemme ask again, nigga who am I?

[Bridge: Smif-n-Wessun]
I shine, you shine
I shine, you shine
I shine, you shine, shine

[Verse 2: Rick Ross]
Fast money, travellin' at lightspeed
Middle school could you tell that I would write these?
Aquarius came up in a house full of Pisces
Top floor of the project we offered sight sea
Flippin' [?] to flippin' [?] will indict me
Say the minimum has never paid the bill
Swimmin' and I'm rollin' like a baker make a [?]
And I'm livin' every moment when I take the field
[?] swingin' memories I won't relive (no)
Memories I won't relive (no)
Get a new deal, made 'em get your boy a loan
Then I backed up out that bitch like I was Lil Pump
Let the top down but I rose the price up every month
Everyday I'm hustlin' I pass your boy the blunt
Pass your boy the blunt

[Chorus: Rick Ross & Smif-n-Wessun]
Twenty whips I find a way to utilize
On a Tuesday night you come and get that super fire (I shine, you shine)
If my life was a movie we'd call it "Superfly" (I shine, you shine)
Sixty million on the low and nigga who am I?
Lemme ask again, nigga who am I?

[Bridge: Smif-n-Wessun]
I shine, you shine
I shine, you shine
I shine, you shine
I shine, you shine, shine

[Verse 3: Rick Ross]
Let's go to physique
The pockets on vet
[?]
[?]
Gon' break in the floor
Robert Kraft with the check
Barely check it's a toast
[?]
As a younger such a dream to [?]
Sweepin' floors, cover lamps and [?] a key
Build a mansion set that bitch right on top of the beach
All my homies call of duty fuck callin' for peace
I keep a murder one, yes right on the leash
Shawty lookin' cute, cannot [?] her hips
If she the truth, I'ma start with the trips
When I wanna ground her I start with a wrist
I start with a Rollie, she start with a kiss
We call it a moment of bliss

[Chorus: Rick Ross & Smif-n-Wessun]
Twenty whips I find a way to utilize
On a Tuesday night you come and get that super fire (I shine, you shine)
If my life was a movie we'd call it "Superfly" (I shine, you shine)
Sixty million on the low and nigga who am I?
Lemme ask again, nigga who am I?

Twenty whips I find a way to utilize
On a Tuesday night you come and get that super fire
If my life was a movie we'd call it "Superfly"
Sixty million on the low and nigga who am I? (I shine, you shine)
Lemme ask again, nigga who am I?

[Bridge: Smif-n-Wessun]
I shine, you shine
I shine, you shine
I shine, you shine
I shine, you shine
I shine, you shine
I shine, you shine, shine
