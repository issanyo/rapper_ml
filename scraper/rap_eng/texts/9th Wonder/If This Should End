[Sample]
So in love with you
So in love with you

[Verse 1]
I guess it's over now
I guess you mad, giving me the cold shoulder now
But when the first of the month about to roll around
Don't worry about them bills, I'mma still hold you down
You disappointed in me, you don't wanna smile
But if not for yourself then do it for the child
I've never been one to stay friends with my exes
You can ask the one that moved out to Texas
Cause Houston, we got a couple problems
And all these weeks of therapy never seem to solve 'em
What are two of those to do
I never thought this would be me and you
And ooh, how I used to judge them other couples
Never in a million years I thought we'd have the same trouble
Pay all watch 'em while we living in this glass house
I tried to hold on but now it's time to tap out

[Chorus]
If this should end, I hope that we can be friends
If this should end, I hope that we can be friends
If this should end, I hope that we can be friends
If this should end, I hope that we can be friends

[Verse 2]
I'll always love my Nintendo 64
Even though I don't play it anymore
Golden Eye will always have a special place in my heart
Star Fox and Mario Kart
Perfect Dark, man the list goes on
But uh, we just can't let this go on
See I grew up in a house with all the fighting and the fussing
Mom screamed for help, me and my little bro rush in
And I don't want this for him
I always thought that I was better than him
I said I thought I was, but it's getting harder cause
I never seen a man who would fight this hard for love
Without examples being set it's like you can't regret
Living up to a standard that you never met
No one ever really showed me the way
So at moments like this all I could really say is

[Chorus]
If this should end, I hope that we can be friends
If this should end, I hope that we can be friends
If this should end, I hope that we can be friends
When this should end, I hope that we can be friends

[Verse 3]
I love the way you spend time with our son
I love the way your sweat glisters when you run
I love the way my name rolls off of your tongue
I love the way you stay doing squats to tighten up your buns
But I can't stand the way interact
I send you bad vibes and you send them right back
Somebody starting sentences, somebody gotta finish that
Lost in conversation 'till we don't know where to listen at
Marriage is a thing I hate that we failed at
As we drifted apart, I hope we sail back
Just like a song, it's to easy to write
Cause everytime I see you, we fight
I always thought I need you in my life
I always thought that my future needed a wife
I gave my all and you did the exact same
But now it's on to brighter days with different last names

[Chorus]
If this should end, I hope that we can be friends
If this should end, I hope that we can be friends
If this should end, I hope that we can be friends
When this should end, I hope that we can be...
Friends
