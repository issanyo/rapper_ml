It's kinda scary
Bloody Bloody Mary
When the flow hits your soul
Make u fly like a fairy
You know it's here g
You know where to party
Brudda Nay
Flows Hitting hard like Ali
When I go in
Niggas wanna ask me
How I stay hot
Like I'm in a flask g
If you're going in
You know your main task g
Is to write a line so fine you can get past me
But you won't
And you will never win
If I'm Carmelo
Then you're Jeremy Lin
Cos your limelight is very very thin
These times I write lines that they feel in Brooklyn
From the North, to the East
To the South
Got the gyaldem screaming out loud
Got the mandem so damn proud
They can't believe a nigga like them made it out
I'm from the city but
Got man in Cunch
It's a pity
Gotta scream free MUNCH
Free David and Free TJ
They got my family locked up
In a cage

It's kinda mad
The streets is flames
It's kinda sad
The Beast is tame
It's kinda bad
The sheep are slain
But never stroke a lion
Or touch it's mane

Cos then it's over
You're screaming for Jehovah
You see my big lips
Got u thinking that I'm Hova
But I ain't
Brudda Nay ain't Jay-Z
And you know
Brudda Nay ain't Lazy
Soon as man bill' a spliff of the haze g
It's so hazy you're gonna need A/C (I LIKE DAT)
And no I don't bang AC
And if you do then blud you're crazy
But it's calm once you getting paid g
And I know that my lyrics bring pain g
And I know that your gyal really hates me
Tell her sorry this is what the world made me

Refrain x2:
Aye G
I'm coming for the ladies
And the man that are killing all the babies
I got links like my name is Pablo
And I'm coming to kill Diablo
