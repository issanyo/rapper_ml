[Hook: Notorious B.I.G. & MLK samples]
(I have a, have a dream)
(It was all a dream)
(We hold these truths to be self-evident...that one day...)
(I have a, have a dream)
(It was all a dream)
(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9) It’s the talented (10)

[Verse 1: Enigma]
"It was all a dream" B.I.G. said, now I drink [?]
Chillin’ on my steps, fresh
Headphones round my neck, to death, it was ’96
Bumpin’ Funk Flex, mom’s living cheque to cheque
Head in the clouds, wishin’ for fresh kicks
Lived two doors down from around the way chick
Cool clean cut, suburban ya get?
Hi-top fade, two parts in my hair
Long gold chain, thoughts on a brain
Love the rap game but since the slight change
A crying shame but the prize I aim for
Hard to paint but rap cryin’ the same song
Life’s a [?] a trade-off, man whatchu afraid of?
Whatchu made of? We bleed the same blood
Love with the same love but life’s a bitch and sometimes full of shit
And it’s all stained up
We balled on the same courts, bald stained a few [?]
Family balled on the corner feelin’ salty [?]
It taught me not to rush, to walk, stand up
Now it’s one for all, my nigga all for one
I drink some

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Sundown]
Fly pidgeons in the plaza, Italiana, grazie, thanks
I’m a persona, non grada
I got a few propositions, cop Obama visions
Hope my knees keeps the dream alive and seize the prism
But never prison, she’s a princess, stress to her
Values and virtues and pray she learns to keep it true
I’m a provider, protective over [?] folk
I try to keep her close under my wing until the wind slow
Keep it one trillion, like a small time deficit
The precedent is set, we push peddle it
Socrates our hypotheses the talented ten
They pretend we don’t exist like ghosts in the wind
See me coastin’ again, raise a pen
They depend on my [?] words to curb any absurd urge
But I defer, just speaking my thoughts lost in Boston
Hustlin’ like Malcolm, the alchemy of Martin in my soul
Yea, away we go, close the books, we got another one
Don’t overlook and now you know, let’s go

[Hook]
