[Verse 1: Tyler Woods]
Listen, girl
Don’t you ever forget I love you
Even when I’m too busy for you sometimes
And girl, don’t you ever forget I need you
No one else could ever replace you
You’re my lady
Do you remember you were so shy
The first time I looked in your pretty brown eyes
I already know that girl
I’d be a fool if I’d ever lose you
So I’mma love you like daddy s’posed to

[Chorus: Tyler Woods & Heather Victoria]
You and me will be together
You and me will be together
You and me, baby
Will be together

[Verse 2: Heather Victoria]
Boy, I’ve been sittin’ here waiting on you
I put it all on the line, I’ll sacrifice
For this feelin’
When you’re holdin’ me tight I get weak baby
So I can hardly breathe
I remember I was so shy the first time
I looked in your pretty brown eyes
Boy, I’d be a fool if I’d ever leave you
So let me love you like momma s’posed to

[Chorus]
