Ayo why did Nyomi break up with me?

This From the top of the thread, Obviously its from the top of the head
You be out in London, Tea and Crumpets
And I just wanted to have someone to keep me company
Last name Whittleton, a little kiss from you in a little bit
And If you got a Third Eye you just heard it
Hair Perfect and A wordsmith
Nyomi, you could of been my only now I'm lonely
Why lonely, cuz I ain't got Moni
I ain't got you, I got alotta Mo-ney
But you sent you sent me a 2Pac vid saying I's rather be a nigga
After you broke up with me
Now Twitter is all I got to relate to chicks
Cuz this is some crazy shit
Her last message said why? you deserve everything and more
But baby you was kinda what I stand for
Afro-centric but Light skinneded so In a light minute I might get finish
She also said you did not do anything wrong though
But baby I'm doing this song so, I don't even know why you would think that
But think back, I told you I would wife you, and my pink cat friend said he likes you too
So maybe he can bag you but I would be dumb mad I he piped you
Cuz you never had one, so I'm mad dumb
You mad young, Feeling your age
Facebook girl I'm feeling your page
I'm still in a rage
Still in a cage
Rage against the machine, but anyway
Wrong band, damn
Smashing Pumpkins
Didn't Think about Smashing you Pumpkin
Just Rubbin your hair
Laying at night
The Hook is kinda tight *phone rings*
Yo who callin me, damn I'm Tight
Real quick, I don't even know who sent this shit *phone rings*
Thats two messages ain't that a bitch
Yo when this Hook comin in, goddamn
