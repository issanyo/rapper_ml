[Verse 1: Tommy Faucets]
I ain't know how to start the song
So let me tell you right from wrong
Never dip out un-noticed
Keep that shit open and one hundred
Even if you’re leaving for nothing
For nothing just say it and keep it moving
Winning or losing
That shit is never cool
It’s only been a couple months
And were back to root one
I’m not a stupid son
If you have a problem just let me know
You could go father my other bros
I don’t mind
I got my own mind
And its one of a kind
And works very different
You could never bring it down
Because what I see keeps it lifted
The future is looking brighter
Than a light you see after an all-nighter
We not fighters, but we'll fight for what’s right
For the 10
Now everyone put your 10s up
And leave them there if you with the movement
Keep following if you think we got stupid flow
That make niggas go whoa did you see that
And you say yeah that’s the 10th Street raps
Make them go grab it off them store shelves
To buy for they moms and they selves
And if you’re enjoying the experience
Keep on the path and don’t go delirious
Because once you do you'll go AWOL
And you'll hit a wall
And they'll keep you in a padded stall
And yes I'm talking about the government
Cause you know they going to cover it up
And there's no way I’ll ever be done
I ride for my team and we all had one dream
And that's to be considered the greatest to ever do it
And there's no way we can lose it
We are right at the finish line
Even when we finish we'll still grind
There's never a time to stop grinding
And that's the way I think
A niggas think it’s funny to compare me to a sink
Now let’s look where your standing
Prancing and dancing along
To one of my fucking songs
And me I'm at the top of the building
And now let's take a look at them feelings
I hope they’re not hurt
Oh and didn’t you buy one of our shirts
Thank you for all of the support
Now you can use this as a fucking report
And you better get a high score
Or you'll be going to war
Matter of a fact hit the floor
Cause I know you don’t want no more bitch
