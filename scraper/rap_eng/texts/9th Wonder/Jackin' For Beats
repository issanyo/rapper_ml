[Part 1: 9th Wonder]
This is rhyme mathematics, so cut the dramatics
Whenever I write rhymes, I feel like I'm writing schematics
To the microphone, music's always been my inspiration
Ever since my creation in this very foundation
Called NC, the birthplace of 9th Wonder
Who provides the beat while my flow strikes like thunder
It's so amazing that my rhyme style’s blazing
Hot like Cajun, like the hell I’m raising
Young and brazen with an aspiration
To be the best of the best, and maybe lead a nation
This here is something you can feel like Aretha
The lyrical creature with the kick like Sonny Chiba
The Street Fighter, all you other emcees is Junjo
I spit the realness while you spit cartoons, bro
Icegod is the nicest, beating emcees lifeless
When I arrive on the stage, emcees think it’s a crisis (Khrysis)

[Part 2: Khrysis]
Next up we got Khrysis on the boards with the heat
Since it’s part 2, observe as I rip apart the beat
Like paper, song creator, soon to be major
Lyrical force is strong with me like I’m Darth Vader
Son, I am your father, you can’t top me
Let alone ever stop me, I do this like a hobby
Papi, así que mejor temes flujo escupo
With this flow, I choke out psuedos like Judo
Kano of the game, and I ain’t talking bout lasers
Shock emcees like tasers, big up all my haters
They’re steady talking nonsense like they got no conscience
Sophisticated with words, while others is hooked on phonics
