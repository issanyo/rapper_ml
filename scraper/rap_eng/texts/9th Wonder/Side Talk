[Hook: repeat 2X]
Listen, this is side talk
You side-step to the side walk
Or ride off with the boss
See it's y'all loss
If I ain't coming around
Cuz I ain't fucking around
I'm gone

[Verse 1]
Listen up, bro
I'mma let yo know
Fuck it, hit when I spit, I throw body blows
Why? Every line is powerful enough
And now that you stuck
Next time you know, acknowledge the Buck
Cuz Duck-down is still arround
We ain't going no-where
We iller now, fuck a rap line or a verse
We're contemplating on letting this nine off first
But 'ma just chill and just work
To murk niggas ain't worth the jerk that coming along
With bitch niggas like you, bird, hum along
I heard you making a song, but got no deal
Oh yeah, the record that you making so the cops don't squeal
You amazing like blocking O'Neal - Not for real
You amazing everytme you think you shopping a deal
With ya - mixtape of the year
On ya side of the desk of an A&R sipping a beer

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
I chant 1-2-3
Let me know me if you're ready for me...lawwd
Cuz if are, I'mma hit ya hard like Boa construct
You know it, it's Buck
This little nigga blowing it up
I ain't a killa
I am a vet
I am a threat
I am the reason that you sweat at night
Watch your neck
Disrespect ain't a part of my vocab
Ya know that
Step to me, get caught like a slow cab
No jab, just hooks and bars
Hooked the underground first right after I hooked them stars
Got niggas in their cars bobbing their heads
Talking about - Buck ain't shit
You heard what he said, off with his mouth
I coulda told you, when you like act like a bird
You get kicked when you come around, stupid, back on the curb
Listen, A word is a word, but that can cause war
Next time, watch your lips or watch your jaw

[Hook]
