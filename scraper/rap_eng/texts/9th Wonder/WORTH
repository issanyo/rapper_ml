[Intro - Bēkon & Kid Capri]
It was always me vs the world
Until I found it's me vs me
Why, why, why, why?
Why, why, why, why?
Just remember, what happens on Earth stays on Earth!
We gon' put it in reverse

[Bridge - Ted Taylor (Sampled)]
Darling, I told you many times
And I am telling you once again
Just to remind you, sweetheart
That my—

[Verse – KeneddyTheDon]
Oh Lord! What an episode
Hail Mary, such an epiphany – felt like my mind exploded
The field of music exhumes hidden talent
It’s so amusing
I’m really feeling that quote from Confucius
Be in love with your career, you’ll never work hard
Conjuring melodies, mixtapes and studio albums in the car while you riding
Makes an excuse to write convoluted stories
In fact, ignite the beef or spread the peace
Record it on analog wax
My concentration has never been so distinguished
Most other niggas’ concentration is centered on trigger fingers
What an alternative to find a way to extinguish enemies or exposition of those within families
'Cause once upon a time, there were two brothers who loved each other in the beginning
But as they grew older, one envied the other
A classic tale of Cain and Abel
Cards on the table – who’s dealt the best hand?
You need to find worth in yourself, or you’ll envy the next man
The older brother became chief of a population
The younger had no place the politics game
This occupation was never his to gain
But, he insisted on twisting his fate to switch lanes
He felt his older brother felt disdain
There’s a perpetual curse of generational hatred that’s lasted for decades
Jealousy was the culprit
It infects my nation like a viral disease
Drop to your knees, God is displeased with your choice of elation
The older brother goes off to marry the love of his choice
Gave birth to four lovely children, the oldest of course a boy
That boy would grow up to give birth to yours truly who’s making noise
My lyrical essence must then be hereditary
I can’t avoid my vocation to profess this story any longer
My paternal great-uncle was a fearmonger
His heart full of envy, it transcended to the next generation
It’s in the DNA of my father’s siblings – his frustration would grow tenfold
His brother was resentful
It reminded him of how his father and uncle just went on their separate ways
Humility’s greatest enemy is envy in every way
They’ll do anything to get paid and don’t give a fuck about shame
As a matter fact, they made plots to make sure it happened
Either imitate or exterminate us to make themselves happy
Being the first to give birth was part of the jealousy
See, my father’s brother caught on to what seemed like a prophecy
The first-born son begets another one, each one a leader
That means they inherit everything their father would leave them
This is not an ordinary will and testament
This is inheritance to lead a nation
What a coveted seat
No wonder my uncle and his uncle before him were jealous
Whenever their brothers would see success, they were never zealous
Such a temperament would lead to eternal damnation and self-destruction
That means it was their own damn stubbornness that pushed the button
As fate would have it, my father’s brother became a pappy first
But, it was a daughter
Oh, you can see God laughing
What a fool he made of himself
From that moment forward, he would covet all my father’s wealth
My father’s uncle plotted against his own children when he married a devil snake
What a familiar decision
The person in competition with my father did the same
Even though he did not resent his children
He’s still to blame for the shame he brought to his family name
Just like his uncle before him who wanted any and everybody to adore him
This is what happens when you don’t see yourself as worthy of what God already gave you
Now, you catchin’ yourself lurkin’ in other people’s territory
Claiming glory that’s not inherently yours
Now you ruined your story and ended up worse than before
A lot was not mentioned, but this is just scraping the surface
Jealousy will eat your soul, so know what your worth is
