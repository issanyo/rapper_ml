[Verse 1]

These are the days that I never wanna give away
I think big for the day that we could get away
But we got to work hard as ever to make it happen
So we got to work hard together
I feel blessed for this life
The people that I got, I die for. I wouldn't think twice
And I love it when they give me advice
Because I feel lost. I'm sick of acting like it's alright
But that's life
Got to give 'em tough luck
Cause if you don't learn the hard way then your bound to fuck up
So I listen to the melody
Illustrate my words and feel incredibly good like I'm on ecstasy
Living in the fast lane. All aboard the last train
I'm carrying this weight with this back pain
I just let it be
Give it everything I have, in the end it's all I got
So I listen to the melody


[Verse 2]

Yeah
I'm feeling far from home, I can't explain how I feel
But i'm grateful
Iv'e met a lot of people that have made me an equal
I can make dreams come true, with the drive that I have
I can race tracks around you
It ain't in my blood to give up
This is shit to relate to
Yeah, it'll make or break you
I could listen, to the words that you have to give
Or I could work on this life that I have to live
This is a lesson that you can't teach
Iv'e been to heights that you can't reach
A situation that I can't speak
I just listen to the melody
And drink away my pain and smoke heavenly
I'm feeling like i'm going to explode, workin' my ass off
So I light this spliff up and I blast off
This is heavenly, 'cause we smoking like we're living in the 70's
So listen to the melody
