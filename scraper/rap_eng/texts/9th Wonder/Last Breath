[Verse 1: GQ]
Maybe a needle and some thread could help me out
I'm trying to mend this
Stringing me along, feeling like a violinist
Why they wasting, valuable time looking for gossip
Guess it's dear to them like a picture in your wallet
Life working on me
Trying to raise to a better day
Convos are interviews and every song's a resume
Huh
She say I got something in me that I don't see
I tell her girl stop bullshitting, cause I don't be
Why worry? I'm covered just like a Raiders eye
I'm doing right and all them others do is plagiarize
Mind blown meditating, bomb threats
Trying to figure out how I'm gonna pay the rent
While coming up with concepts

[Hook]
Now I make my mom stress trying to grow up
Try and tell her, everyday the sun ain't gonna show up
But know what? Your baby good
Not even bothered by it
A soft spoken nigga from a city not as quiet

[Verse 2: GQ]
All said and done with, I'm trying to walk a path
When I leave I can leave my seeds something to run with
I know it's gonna hurt the people dear to me
But you know I'd rather see you smile than to see you drop a tear for me
Eventually the pain fades and the scars stay
Just to remind you that you made it from a long way
From kickball to playing freeze tag
To seeing little kids fall in life without having their knees scab
I'm just trying to be comfortable as a bean bag
Avoiding dog niggas and bitches like I'm a flea bath
I'm on the rise so anticipating fall outs
City cold, had to get away so I could thaw out
A blessing like a foul ball, trying to catch one
Everybody following trends, nobody set none
You not hungry until you appreciate a breadcrumb
I'm loving life till my death come

[Hook]
Now I make my mom stretch trying to grow up
Try and tell her everyday the sun ain't gonna show up
But know what? Your baby good
Not even bothered by it
A soft spoken nigga from a city not as quiet

[Verse 3: GQ]
I got memories in my rearview
If time flies put a wing in my watch see what a year do
I know they see something in me you only see in a few
I speak life, they overhype what they don't even do
What I strive for
Is that a figment of my imagination that got me thinking like my eyes low
Or not thinking at all just more grammer, young and black
Love the fact they on me like store cameras
Me and Petty talked about, see i explained to him
All these niggas shoot for stars, me, I aim through them
Came a long way from running suicides to making sure these lines touch a heart
Or two, walking through where most niggas don't find much
Shit that pull them back just get accustomed to the customs
Don't fall for that
All of that is me still readjusting
I've seen my share of coffins though it's not something I'm glad to boast
Few niggas is doing time all the other half are ghosts
Can't believe Adam gone, potential man, he had the most
Tried to pull him to safety but he just couldn't grab the rope
Apple full of poison took a bite without an antidote
Cold as fuck, barely had enough time to grab a coat
I'm playing hard like Manigault for a bag a coke
A good nigga just happened to take a bad approach
Devil on my shoulder laughing at me while he cracking jokes
Angel on the other shoulder saying "he just mad you close"

[Outro]
Nigga haha Yeah
