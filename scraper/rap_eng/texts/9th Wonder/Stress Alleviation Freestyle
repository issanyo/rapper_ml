I’m +Young+ and soon to make +Bucks+, leaving no +T-I-P’s+
With the flow Notorious like B.I.G
Lyrically I train hard with verses that damage your brain hard
And remain hard enough to leave your brain scarred
Like seizures, rhyme speaker, keep my flows in freezers
Emcees catch hundred degree fevers
IceGod is the name, and I came to blow lames
Out the frame and reclaim the lyrics to the game
Cause there’s a lack of lyrical talent that’s ruining the balance
Of hip-hop, it’s like your favorite emcees are absent
Call me the substitute with the absolute
Rhyme style that's way above emcees' altitude
Despicable pitiful cats cannot measure up to my lyrical
Pinnacle full of formidable subliminal syllables
To leave them in +Konfusion+ with the words +Organized+
Next on my +Extinction Agenda+ is the commercialized
Hip-hop that's got me +Stressed+ while I'm lyrically blessed
With the skill I possess as I slowly progress
With the right synonyms and verbs, no hyperboles
To the Jewish fake emcees, I'm a Nazi from Germany
In my holocaust, I bring more fire than Molotov
Don't worry if I write songs, I write monologues
It just shows that when I decompose with flows
Intestines, guts, and brains get exposed, case closed

As I focus my dopeness, I split hopeless MCs like Moses
I was chosen as a poet with the flows most ferocious
As I spit ‘em, you don’t know what you’re missing
Cause like I said before, this is only the beginning
