[Verse 1]

Let's get right to the issue
The difference between what a pistol and a fist do
A fist will prove your manhood
A pistol will prove you can't fight and only your man would
Good, I was down for some duck hunting
Y'all don't want nuttin' while they jumped up fronting like
You ready to play mister tough
You can still get snuffed when the fifth is tucked
Listen, I [?] but the fifty two salute slap box
Him on top of the roof and now I gotta prove how
Shooting a gun don't make you the one
Plus the nine got a mind of its own and won't bun
Hold up son, I know you had a fight before
Yeah, last year you was right on the floor
And your jaw was the main topic of the hoods discussion
Now you hoping that you good with bussin', that's nothing

[Chorus]

They don't use fists now they gotta use clips
On streets now all I see is this
Everybody got something to bust
But if you real then you will knuckle up
(That's what's up!)
They don't use fists now they gotta use clips
On streets now all I see is this
Everybody got something to bust
But if you real then you will knuckle up
(That's what's up!)

[Verse 2]

Everybody wanna pop or pop off
Til them trucks come and them bodies dropped or dropped off
Y'all are fucked if y'all think y'all lost
If you don't come with a Glock or a shot to pop off
What's false? False is when you act like the boss
And you wind up smacked up and told get lost
You couldn't box if your arms was long enough
To guard your face, ah nah not the waist
Hold up, lemme take a guess, you packing?
Or you acting like you strapped in? Slap him
That's when I'll be in the back just laughing
You a joke and a headache so pass me a aspirin
This ain't a fight, this fashion, let me ask him
Why instead of knuckling up you ducking and blasting?

[Chorus]

They don't use fists now they gotta use clips
On streets now all I see is this
Everybody got something to bust
But if you real then you will knuckle up
(That's what's up!)
They don't use fists now they gotta use clips
On streets now all I see is this
Everybody got something to bust
But if you real then you will knuckle up
(That's what's up!)

[Verse 3]

My little man had a fair one
All I seen is shorty pull a taped up flare gun
Everybody was jetting
In the lobby they stepped to shorty yo somebody is wetting
But no, he only stunting with that fake gat
My man Jeff threw the left like "take that"
Even as an adolescent
He was known for a left, no need to stress the Mac-11
Got every reverand in the church like look
The way you know the hook, know the good book
To slow you up, I know what up he ain't butt but
You better settle down if you wanna grow up cause
Nowadays niggas got foul ways
Shit hey, my little man Jay was shot by a stray
Yeah not in his face but right in his back
Your knuckle game ain't right and exact
If you come right with a strap
Think about that

[Chorus]

They don't use fists now they gotta use clips
On streets now all I see is this
Everybody got something to bust
But if you real then you will knuckle up
(That's what's up!)
They don't use fists now they gotta use clips
On streets now all I see is this
Everybody got something to bust
But if you real then you will knuckle up
(That's what's up!)
