[Intro:]
Yeah, uh
Edo
Yes, yo
Knife

[Verse 1:]
Edo and Mag trappers get metal and bagged
Rappers offsides get penalty flagged
Enemies get dragged toe tagged no swag
Hit em in the mouth so they won't brag
Bossed in them Philly revolt like Diddy
It could get ugly before it gets pretty
Y'all are talentless never off balance this
I make choices you make challenges
You raise voices I raise silences ride with us
Flow back to golden age up on your calendars
Islanders from New York know hockey though
Red sauce noodles no pasta bowl net like a soccer goal
Impossible to catch me sleep I don't nap no more
I don't need the rap no more i'm to balance out the Macklemores
Ratched on tour and I don't mean the way we act
Raising kids making snacks every time we slay the mac

[Verse 2:]
You the same we them other guys
Discover lies, sleep you get caught that's where trouble lies
Me and ma Alley Town allies man brother oversize
Some are wise some are otherwise
No wins no decisions you got sight dog but no vision
You know the rules son pick a side chose one
Years to get friends seconds to lose one

[Verse 3:]
I'm that dude from wherever I'm at
A lot a rappers tell ma story but they never was that
We spit facts you're a memory lapse on Hennessy
Black on enemies till I get ma energy back
It's 2 OG(s) Ed and the King and ma plan is manifesting
What I said in the bing magnetic earing
A Jokes only take 2 calls you move work we packing up the van no U-haul

[Verse 4]
You too small to brawl you play foosball
Can't ball at all you take a sue fall
Screw y'all who y'all don't feel withdrawn climbing up a ladder too tall
Black poet like [?] retired from pitching
Now i'm coaching it's devotion to crossing the line without encroachment
My approach is a classic one
Be a father to your child before I make him a bastard son
From a plastic gun arteries distance
I'm a mother fucking predicate like part of the sentence
Ma own worst enemy a call them ma fears
Still the life of a kid after all these years
You part of the problem put us in this mess we in
You normal average so pedestrian the more you lose the less we win
Edo on his high horse like an a equestrian
You rappers got hurt and scared
Hard work beats talent if talent ain't working hard
Heat like south Palo killed the apalo
Chickens can unfollow but they can't unswallow
This is hip hop coming through yo speakers
You can't sing or dance you a after dinner speaker
Get start with Tim's and Jim's sneakers
Edo King Mag knife wonder the Grim reapers
