[Verse 1: Rapper Big Pooh]
I done been around the globe, with records I sold
Came back home, pride got stole
Poobie ain't the one to ever break down and fall
Sketched a new plan, made a few mo'
Pulled out a scroll and jotted a few notes in it
Don't be concerned with niggas homie, go get it
I show spit it for my UK peeps
Brother you don't want it when LB's in the street
Dude, we got heat, keep jams like jelly
Swing like Teddy, come box with me
Want what with me? Yeah I rides with P
And 9th my codeine when we go to the mic
We let beats and rhymes take us where we like
Shit, I might fly off tonight
I'm tellin you right, Stockholm might find you a wife
Where you can land and catch your cool where the climate is nice

[Hook: Rapper Big Pooh]
I done been around the world, Japan to Amsterdam
Californ-i-a and back again
Up and down ninety-five like I'm traffickin
Still, it's no place like home
You know how it is when you out, hear folks talkin bout
Where they was when it happened, who is, who ain't rappin
People still packin, cups flow with 'gnac
And still, it's no place like home

[Verse 2: Rapper Big Pooh]
I done been around the globe and back again
LB took a week, flew out to Japan
Ate steak and Koubei, rode the bullet train
I thought niggas was goin down comin back on the plane
I toured the US in a broke RV
Drivin down the coastline is a sight to see
Still, it's no place like life in NC
Or, goin back to the seven-oh-three
Every breath got a drum and a kick
A moment to sit, think about all the places I been
Then I'm, right back to the paper and pen
You know, I gotta do it again

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Joe Scudda]
Yeah, uh, home's where the heart is and that's real
Cause you don't appreciate home until you gone
So when I'm all alone I just think about my people
At the crib for a minute and it puts me in the zone
And it's all right where I need to be
Cause I know I'm not around but there's people I love there that needin me
And I can see it in they eyes when I come back
Seein my momma and she happy that her son back
Pops too, let me say props to
9th and Pooh for lettin me stop through
It's because of them I'm outa state doin wild shit
Instead of back at the crib doin some foul shit
They peep game, gave me some pointers
Now I'm in different cities standin on different corners
So if I'm gone you can hit me on the phone
I'll be gone for a minute but I'm soon to be home

[Hook]

[Rapper Big Pooh]
It's no place like home
That's why I'm right here, I love bein here baby
I done been around the world and I-I-I
Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh
9th Wonder, C Sams, broad, forty free
Uh, yeah, HOJ
