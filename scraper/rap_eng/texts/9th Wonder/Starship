I should've done things right lookin' back
But 20/20 hindsight, can't change the facts
Too much pride, pro'lly broke the back
Of the camel, not the haystacks
We was so right together, up on the phone late night
Just talking about whatever, yeah that's what couples do
We was together before it was official
Picnics, restaurants, movies, I'm missing you
It hurts my heart so much
Going these days without your touch
Not seeing you smile
Us breaking up, damn that shit was wild
Going back in time, I'd change a few things now
'Cuz you was more important than trips to the mall
I could've passed on shootin' ball, for a day or two
So instead you chose to pass on me
Since that day, Pooh has been free, until you come back...

[Hook]
You are... my life... my love...
(Come take me up tonight)
Starship baby that's what you are
You are... my life... my love...
(Come take me up tonight)
Starship baby that's what you are

[Phonte]
Ayo, I think back to the days when I first was pursuing you
It's funny what distance can do to you
It make a nigga reminisce more than usual
Back to the times when we were innocent
When we was young, carefree, with crazy benefits
Cutting classes, skipping work, but didn't give a shit
I miss those simple days in a sense
Waking up next to you made all my mornings more intimate
Watching you sleep and breathe in and out
Holding you close, relieved any doubts
When all my dreams started withering
Inside myself I was livin' it
Selfish as fuck and not being half the man that I should've been
I'm sorry if I ever felt like a waste of time
But now I'm thinking from a longer term, state of mind
Tell me your dreams love, I'll make 'em mine
Yo, I ain't frontin' girl, it's you I'll always stand behind
You take me up...

[Hook]
You are... my life... my love...
(Come take me up tonight)
Starship baby that's what you are
You are... my life... my love...
(Come take me up tonight)
Starship baby that's what you are
You are... my life... my love...
(Come take me up tonight)
Starship baby that's what you are
You are... my life... my love...
(Come take me up tonight)
Starship baby that's what you are

[Big Pooh]
It's been some months, but we back to speaking
"How you doing?" "How you been?"
"You look good." "So do you."
So what's up this weekend?
Let's hit the town say for old time's sake
I'll come get you girl, I won't be late
So watch you gonna do?

[Phonte]
Yo, don't be late tonight, I ain't even tryin' to hate tonight
Fuck watching T.V. we goin' on a date tonight
Dancin' in Japanese steak tonight
So won't change into that outfit I bought you
You know the one you got when you thought I ignored you
Doing that sexy little salsa move I taught you
Don't ever say that I've never did nothing for you
I know how relationships can bore you

[Big Pooh]
Or you can choose to chill from the night life
Kick back, it's sky blue tonight, me and you no moves tonight

[Phonte]
It's on you baby choose the night
You think I'm just trying to write songs?
With my words, I'm trying to right wrongs
Build a relationship that's like stone
Eighty years old ?a care of wince? holdin' hands on the cyclone
With a career that is life-long
Showin' you love with my mics on, take me up baby

[Hook]
You are... my life... my love...
(Come take me up tonight)
Starship baby that's what you are
You are... my life... my love...
(Come take me up tonight)
Starship baby that's what you are
You are... my life... my love...
(Come take me up tonight)
Starship baby that's what you are
You are... my life... my love...
(Come take me up tonight)
Starship baby that's what you are
