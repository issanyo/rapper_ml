[Hook: MC David J]
Kick back and just relax
Ima vibe with you kick back and just relax
Kick back and just relax all the hype and the drama ain't got time for that

[Verse 1: MC David J]
Quick 16, i haven't been at this for a minute
Like a breath of fresh air when im spittin out my lyrics
David J the realest, talk it how I live it
Walk it how I be it and kill it when I see it Been a
Way in San Antonio handlin my business
Became an Airman in the Air Force forces
Im only 19 and already on some grown ish
Check my bank account make you throw up some mucos
They callin me a grown man Thats what I
Know dog everything has followed plan According
Ly make yo life a tragedy dramatically mortal
Kombat hit the spit button fatality
Im yo majesty call me a king I got the scripture
Check the 16 old school let me rip ya
Mr. Milla Nilla take a quick picture
Killin everything boy Im the new Hitler

[Hook: MC David J]
Kick back and just relax
Ima vibe with you kick back and just relax
Kick back and just relax all the hype and the drama ain't got time for that

[Verse 2: MC David J]
Spin it back up rewind the tape so I can cut it
Puke it back up and pour it up so I can chug it
Nastiest flow make a Haitian face greena
Sick got a cold flow smoking emphysema
But this ain't no cough syrup im cleaner than some water tell yo
Girl to stop trippin man dont even bother
Me, thats right, its mr. Delight I got the
X and the Z so what up with tonight
Hit the
Cellie up got off work a brotha chillin
Grocery store got the burgers now im grillin
BBQ chicken, hot dog killin from the
Grill to the plate yo boy is Finger lickin defi
Nition of a good ass night ya boy the dictionary
Come and study up this pictuary legendary
Ima spit the truth no liar liar no jimmy carrey
Ima keep it chill no moma drama no springer jerry

[Outro: MC David J]
