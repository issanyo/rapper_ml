[Intro: Bishop Lamont]
Jeah! We tapin'? Hallelujah. We tapin'. We tapin' the crowd man
Wanna say 'What up? ' to the N.C. namean? Little Brother
Justice League, I see you
It's no wonder why they call you 9th Wonder man
I understand clearly
It's NC to CA. Oh yeah. Yeah, yeah. Wu-Tang
This right here, I'm takin' it back with this one right here
Of course got to. Feel like 36 Chambers all over again
It's Bishop man. The game is so empty right now
Oh yeah. Everybody on that glamor and glitz
Empty ass fake rap shit
Everybody talkin' bout how much they love the game
They really just love the fame. They bout the money
Only giving praises to God in they speeches when they gettin' rewards
Now that shit ain't right. You know

[Hook]
When you make it to the top
Got the chickens on your jock
E'rybody always say they "love you"
But when your next album flop and you 'bout to get dropped
That's when you find out they don't really "love you"
Rappers talk about stacks in they hoods in they raps
But they don't give back, they don't "love you"
Got a thug in your life, beat you up every night
God damn boo, he don't really "love you"

[Verse 1: Bishop Lamont]
When I ride in my ride I don't listen to the radio
Cause niggas spit that same ole', same ole', lazy flow
Ever since T.I., everybody samples Jay-Z's flow
Like swell, awe hell, he might as well direct the video
And when you go to pose, you might as well yell "Hov"
Borrow some of his clothes and borrow some of his flows
These albums should come with pillows cause all I do is doze
I be sleepin' cause wack niggas ain't reachin'
Me with what they speakin'
Nigga I ain't preachin' (naw)
I'm just talkin' shit
Cause nigga I'm pissed
I miss that Artifacts, Tribe Called and Boot Camp Clik
That Black Sheep, Camp Lo and Souls Of Mis
That Pharcyde and Freestyle Fellowship (what up P?)
The U.M.C.'s "Blue Cheese", niggas that was the shit
Boogiemonsters, X-Clan, boy how could I forget?
Man, this rap now-a-days be on some real bullshit

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Pr1me]
I hit 'em with a stiff hard and stiff dick
And you can never play and old dog with new tricks
You stink like Nesquick, you never had a chance
I wrote the circumstance
Had you glancin' my advance
Knew how to sing and dance
The way I'm feelin' relationships are feather weight
So "Where Is The Love" like Will.I.am and Timberlake?
Allow me to demonstrate, can never calculate what we create
Keep me here forever, let me elaborate
To jackin' the Coke
Push man was set on the dope
Temp rhymin' fresh on the stove
When they was doubtin' the flow
You bitches wasn't try to holler, you was glad I was broke
Until you heard my pen was deadlier than second hand smoke
Uh
And momma said I need a job with the union
Now I'm famous
Performin' at my family reunions, what an anus
So hanis like I'm high off drugs
If this fame wasn't here would I still feel the love?

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Indef]
Yeah, uh
Bastard son as I chase no love
I found music
When KRS was in the Bronx sellin' drugs
Before extravagant tattoo's and dubs
Fake niggas
Overflow with thick hoes and pro clubs
The fascination of crack I rap fucked up
13 year old girls wantin' they tits touched up
The image of perfection got pressure on young
And can't say they time tables, know how to load a gun
Know how to run from reality and one time
Scene so familiar like the generation befo' mine
Strays be hittin' babies, before Columbine
Lunch line, I used to hit the? with a rusty nine
So I could slip home in one piece
My grand momma loves me and trust me kids it's lovely
I guess now more than ever, brought me to this
War dog, new west, so children follow this

[Hook]
