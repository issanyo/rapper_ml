Make me hot P
Hold me down P
Make me hot P

[Verse 1 - Phonte]
We was in the club
That's where I saw you
It was my nigga P
He was a tall dude
Wanted to get your number
So I could call you
Coming to missy aunt's
Oh P don't fall through

[Hook]
Just make me hot P
Hold me down P
Make me hot P
Hold me down P

Just make me hot

Just make me hot

[Hook]
Just make me hot P
Hold me down P
Make me hot P
Hold me down P
