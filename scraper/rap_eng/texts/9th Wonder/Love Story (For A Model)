[Verse 1]
This song goes out to another model
Drowning all her sorrows with another bottle
But is it difficult to hear yourself?
Or to become yourself, when life is just another living hell
Or when the world saw your face right on that video?
Did you think that no one else would ever ever know?
Is it amazing how you blew up like this overnight?
Or how it happened on the couch just the other night?
What ever happened to the girl that lives next door?
Or are you still the same girl, just not anymore?
I still think you got a face like Barrymore
And I don't care if you are really really feeling sore
You could have just become another nobody
But now you're doing something, and now you're somebody
I know you're thinking all of this is really boring
Just remember that this is what became your love story


[Verse 2]
This verse goes out to another model
Making minds boggle, becoming my idol
Ever since I saw her face right on that video
About that singer and the models in the windows
You got a face like Sue, ya know I'm not lying
I approach it all with ease, because I'm not tryin'
To really impress you, so you say I'm over it
But you're the one drug I don't think I'll ever quit
I don't think it really matters if I had to say
That I really really really want it that way
Whatever happened to your dreams to be a movie star?
Well I forgot that you're a model, that goes pretty far
Well I just wanted you to know how much I really care
And I don't know if anything I say will make it fair
Well maybe we could take a shot and share the glory
Just remember that this is what became your love story
