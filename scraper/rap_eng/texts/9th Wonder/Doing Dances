[Intro]
Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh
Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo
Turn that down a lil bit
Uh, uh, uh, uh
Can I hear myself just a little bit more
Yeah
Are you recording?
[?} looks stupid in here
Uh

[Verse 1]
Campaigning over this shit here, promoting myself
Travel at a speed where I'm a ghost of myself
Headed down to Florida to approach myself
Making love in the Bahamas, getting close to myself
Send a kite to Ghana, tryna focus myself
Getting high off the ganja to provoke myself
Blinded by the diamond, many loathe myself
At times, I, too, am blinded, tryna notice myself
Looking over myself
Lost in daydreams, in the mirror, tryna sober myself
Back to reality, the motive is the wealth
Gotta feed Amiyah, gotta mold her myself, man
That's what I told myself
There's no help, independent village, everybody goes for self
Searching for the answers that I hold within myself
Except for Martis, for the role model, I chose myself
Now

[Hook]
I'm in the spotlight, just doing my dance
Median was last spotted somewhere doing his dance
Maintaining, baby, doing my dance
Median, I gotta get it so I'm doing my dance
Catch me somewhere just doing my dance
If you miss me, I was probably somewhere doing my dance
Just playing the cut and doing my dance, man
Doing my dance, man, I'm just doing my dance

[Verse 2]
I know you love me, it's the gift from within
My niggas feel the spirit everytime I spit at him
They can feel it in their skin
Hellraising, giving niggas chills when the [?] starts to build
When my spirit starts to wield
My thoughts into existence, the fetish of my heart just for the listener
I can't explain it
Then again, through rhythm, I'm making a fine statement of my art's heart containment
In real time, allowing those with listening eyes
To hear mine, and I did it just to kill time
Just to fill mine, til it run em over
Just to spill mine over, til it's drunken from the floor
(Yes yes)

[Hook]

{Verse 3]
Blinded by the diamond, many loathe myself
At times, I, too, am blinded, tryna notice myself
As I send a kite to Ghana, tryna focus myself
Getting high off the ganja to provoke myself
Headed down to Florida to approach myself
Making love in the Bahamas, getting close to myself
Campaigning over this shit here, promoting myself
Travel at a speed where I'm a ghost of myself
But I know it's myself
Game pimping niggas, til I almost started hoeing myself
The hold that I'm [?}, plus the role of myself
We make our own games, playing controller myself
I should be coaching myself, no question
J-Lizzy for the Justus, gunpowder musket iddish
So 9th Wonder, if you feel me, hit me once
(A-break-a-one, a-break-a-two)
Yup, yup, doing dances now

{Hook]
