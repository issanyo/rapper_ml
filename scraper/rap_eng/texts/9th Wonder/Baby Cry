BABY CRY

Yeah yeah
Cry cry baby cry cry
(So whatchu do ?)

All I do is
Hop from
Beat to beat
Like I'm bunny rabbit
I got big teeth
Call me Buggs
Bunny
Got my beats on
Chewing carrots
Spit it in ya face while
Im eating
So I don't choke
Running 8 mile
Only thing choking
Is your girl when I'm up
In her throat
Throw the pussy at me
Like a alley oop
So I dunk in it
I eat the shit throughout
Like its dunkin donuts
Ya ex boy Dunkie
Girl He a junkie
So I don't drink
Bout sip this ros√©
Let me make a toast
I am sophisticated
Bitch Imma boss
Hugo don't call me
I prefer Robert
One day I might
Buy me a Hublot
Maybe when I blow up
Like Tory
Wanna be big
As no-to-ri-ou-s
Man stay in ya lanez
All I do is tell stories
Paint a picture
Man are you snapping ?
(Snapchat)
Put it in ya story
Imma pretend like
I didn't know
I know I know
Man she knows Cole
Apparently
But I be sitting
On the sideline
Watching my future
Pass by
Bye bye like
Mariah Carey
Bitch wants me
To carry her cause
Her feet hurt
Well cry baby
Like bye bye baby
I'm that nasty
With these ladies
If I get a deal
Imma buy me a
Ritz
As a matter of fact
I don't wanna sign
Only thing ya boy
Wanna do is sign
Autographs
Call it a graph
Cause just like it
Goes up and down
Like a heart beat
Call me HBK
Cause I'm a heart breaker
Don't act up with me
Before I give you
A sweet chin music
For free
This dick even free tho
Let me take a break
When I'm done
I'll be back
Stuck here in the middle
Like the middle finger
I'm done
Like Tyga well done
