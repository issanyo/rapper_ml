[Verse 1: GKWunder]
Throughout this year and all it's shitty parts
I brought a sense of belonging
From the use of how my flow departs
From straight kicking
Repeated hate dissing
To where ambition gets my fam to eat, dietitian
Had conclusions to stories that shouldn't end
And even questioned myself of what truly is a friend
Then again an end means a new will begin
But I hope my bitter past won't have
A future evil twin present
Cause it's a one way ticket to hell
A sob story to tell, then alienated Roswell
It's truly heartbreaking to see, then having
That vacancy feeling of being empty
Yeah it's ironic how I have plenty of nothing
Shit, ain't that last line something?
Knowing you have nothing to lose
Filling the shoes that don't fit your views
Then expected to run with it, without tripping once
And there are no safety crews with the way my grind
Stunts, read between the lines that underline
My spoken word, don't take my word for it cause
It's worded to be heard, by a herd of sheep that
Have their perceptions blurred, and they still can't
Understand like my speech is slurred, cuz my
Rhymes go in one ear and out the other
But ya still fucks with it like an obessed lover
Still most think my theory's absurd y'all
But this is pitched straightforward, no curveball
So I lived my life with nothing that I take back
And if you wanna hear the truth hit the playback
I lived my life with nothing that I take back
And if you wanna hear the truth hit the playback, sucka!
Vent, time well spent
