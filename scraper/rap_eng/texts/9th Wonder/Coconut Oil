Coconut oil, smooth slide through the vintage
Spot that we used to rock early in beginnings
My head used to spin then
A small crowd trippin’ on me, flippin’
Now the family expand in London, in Brixton
Smoking winstons how my lips burn to touch mics
95 grey nikes
Feel the re-release of beast, middle east
Ain't not saving um like day light
Arabs? Muslims? All of um my cousins
Beauty brown skin might
Bomb on a nigga
Ain't nothing to do with Qurans
Ramadan for the figures
Cheddar
Come night we all eat together
Kings and Queens accented with gold leather
Royal
Sippin Royal, smoke like two letters
Two Ls, like swell
Blow up your spot, never
Underestimate the plot, my flock stick together
Shining on you daily, no matter crazy the weather
Glimmer like diamonds in chains
Pain a pleasure, in time, if it help me do better
Promised my mama, said “Mama I'mma get you whatever”
You just dream, 9th gon’ keep the swing
Opposite cream, we gon ride all black living better
I brought it back, like I told y'all, forever
Culture, keep it focused you can’t sever my ties
I’m always gon' ride Jamla till the death of me
I’m always gon' ride Jamla till the death of me
I’m always gon' ride Jamla till the death of me

[Verse 2: Raekwon]
Your face feel like suede, body is a 9.9
One more time, a diamond on display
Tiffany goddess in tennis wear
Staying a dentist, all that white on
Dro mixed with Guinness
We flew to Milan
Cherry Range Ro’ on the lawn
“Boo, where ya Qur’an?”
Its right here
Weird palaces in Mecca
We dressing, less filming she cryin’
All praises then extended both arms
Laid on the rug, thought about my life style
Hugged my lady harder, regarded
Regardless pardon Miss lets flow beyond
Palaces where blue water just flow
Coolin’ wit a bong
The ocean was talking to me
“Stay sucker free, be gone, love your enemies
Nights may seem you wrong”
Lights, camera, and wealth a song
I sat up for days before legend status
Now we be born

[Raekwon: Outro]
Its that
Its that that black sand talk right here
Word up, yo Raps what good
You know your brother got you
Damn, I hear that fly shit going on in the back
9th Wonder you remarkable nigga
You like a flooded ill magic marker
I’m ready to write graffiti nigga
Yo, pass that
What the fuck is that name of that bottle right there?
That shit is called “mnvkhjkbwkebrds,fba”
I don't what that shit is
That shit is crude nigga
That’s all
