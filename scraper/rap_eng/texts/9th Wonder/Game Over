[Verse 1: Kelly]
Six foot, dark skin, damn, baby, you got me open
Your heart is so big
Buy anything Kelly be wantin’
You’re just God sent
Ooh, that way that you be talkin’
Has gotten my attention
And I ain’t doin’ nothin’ but listenin’

[Chorus]
Ain't no one like you
That makes me wanna kiss like you
Nobody ever could handle this like you
For anybody askin’ the game is over
Ain't no touch like you
That makes me wanna touch like you
Nobody ever could handle this like you
For anybody askin’ the game is over

[Verse 2: Beyoncé]
My boy is so hood
He does that thing to me so good
His mindset so complex
You’d never think he’s from the projects
He’s my best friend perfect fit for a husband
His swagger, his confidence
He’s got his little mama’s mind bent

[Bridge 1]
Thank God you sent him to save me
(My joy, oh, my joy)
His style is so amazing
(My heart is open for the taking)

[Chorus]
Ain't no one like you
That makes me wanna kiss like you
Nobody ever could handle this like you
For anybody askin’ the game is over
Ain't no touch like you
That makes me wanna touch like you
Nobody ever could handle this like you
For anybody askin’ the game is over
Ain't no one like you
That makes me wanna kiss like you
Nobody ever could handle this like you
For anybody askin’ the game is over
Ain't no touch like you
That makes me wanna touch like you
Nobody ever could handle this like you
For anybody askin’ the game is over

[Bridge 2: Michelle]
Oh, my man, my man
He does whatever it takes to satisfy me
This man, this man
He knows me inside out, my wants and my needs
His ways are so unique
The way he protects me
No price, no ring, no house
No material thing could ever take him from me

[Interlude]
Ain’t no one like you, no, no-no-no
Ain’t no one like you, no, no-no-no

[Chorus]
Ain't no one like you
That makes me wanna kiss like you
Nobody ever could handle this like you
For anybody askin’ the game is over
Ain't no touch like you
That makes me wanna touch like you
Nobody ever could handle this like you
For anybody askin’ the game is over
Ain't no one like you
That makes me wanna kiss like you
Nobody ever could handle this like you
For anybody askin’ the game is over
Ain't no touch like you
That makes me wanna touch like you
Nobody ever could handle this like you
For anybody askin’ the game is over
