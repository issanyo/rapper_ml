[Verse 1: Young Don]
Think I need some closure
Maybe some exposure
To something new cause I feel like I'm getting closer
Have a nigga fold, like a fucking folder
I've been holding all this weight like I'm lifting boulders
Getting wiser as I'm aging older
Just know I'm prepping for this war, I'm a fucking soldier
Season changed and it's getting colder
Like these bitches hearts do, they just fuck you over
Now I'm fucking sober
They way you got me, only thinking of myself
Barely getting any rest cause I'm too worried 'bout my wealth
I got to start making paper, put some music on the shelf
Can I do this on my own, should I ask someone for help
Left me with this song stuck in my head
Traumatized, can't get it out of my head
I got my feelings embed
I don't call it venting, I just put my thoughts in the led
I got a plan, I'm always thinking ahead, yea

[Hook]
I could never get you out my memory
Smoke a blunt while I sing this melody

[Verse 2: Young Don]
Lord knows if my words don't come together
Ima write it in a song, you gone hear my words forever
I know, there's some things that we could have done better
You can't get me out my zone, I'm already all settled
My opinion doesn't matter but it does on instrumentals
I left ya
Cause you know you always fucking with my mental
Forget you
Don't forget me when I get up on the venue
I'm cooking, my mamma cooking, Ima check what's on the menu
Without thinking
I lost all my instinct
Lighting blunts like they were in-scent
The pain it never lifted
I'm always reminiscing
Seeing all these visions
Worried about the past that's why you see me acting different
I'm missing, what the mission is
You say that I'm trippin'
I don't know what it is
I just want to live in peace, please let me live

[Hook]
