Yea
I am the lonely
Little
Lyrisist
And heara me speak
About the problems of the days
To problems of ya weeks
Shit
Take a seat
Let me heal ya stress
Look like
My green girl
Got a new blunt dress
But keep you impressed
Cuz while im spittin this rhyme
Im prolly twistin a blunt
Unique blown minds
A shining star in my movie
And this boy shines
But anyways tell whats on ya mind
Did you have a bad week
Toke shit and forget it
The problems that you let
Will you give the stress
I Live a positive mindstate
No thing less
See me get a boeng jet
Witha vietnam vet
Im let my mind be known
Bet he rocks a mean bone
In his esophagus
Downright an optimist
And im outgoing
Content not even knowing
No talk im into showing
Chronic smoke is what im blowin
Knowing im in paradise the rest of my
Time here luckyily a living soul
Absent with the mind fear
Dont come non smokin naggin in my face
Ive stolen apples to waste
Filled with marijuana paste
And as taste was acquired
Id fight fire wit fire
Desire entire Fields
I'm higher then what I yield
Yes sire ive got my shield and my sword get the fuck back
Cutchu up qucker then yo bitch when
She say fuck that
Lifes got ups nd downs just like a ducks flap nuks at
Santa barbara california trust that
Sneaky as a muthafucka yes i am a muskrat
Bump my fuckin system like i hope that i get cussed at
Ladies in the town think they
Happy but they down downin
Bottles by the kitchen counter you could hear the sound
Im aware and on point like a lookout for a tagger
Only difference ima rapper aka velocirapper
