Wow
I like it
I love it
Iss tight

Lust is one helluva drug
I need a tolerance break, baby pass the love
No time to waste; it does not exist
Swam the fountain of youth
The backstrokes legit
Don’t trip bout the size of my ship
For now just know I’m proud of it mami
I ain’t an onomatopoeia nigga
Imma pick ya brain, make the neighbors know my name
While the same song bangs
Look...just tryna seduce you
Fondle, kindly spoil & consume you
I got a fetish of innocent, elegant Asians & Mexicans
But lust ain’t discriminant
Ay are ya clean, are ya dirty?
Truth be told i’m just a rookie
So fuck a body count, if I feel the energy
Withdrawals kickin in, baby I need the remedy

This lust for love
This love for lust
This lust, oh lust is helluva drug
This lust for love
This love for lust
This lust, oh lust is helluva—

Love is one helluva drug
Gimme more, can’t get enough
But I heard too much of sweet things turn to poison
And everything is nice with chocolate
So wanna pop it, roll it, drop it?
I might slang it around free for profit
I'm good at mathematics but I hate word problems...
A line of love is enough for solving the X stress, & the bitterness the boy left
What if I told you my flaws can build a great wall? Would you see right through em & find the halo?
Or would you wonder what happened to cut my tail & horns?
I had to change. Cuz love is like cocaine
No agape. So baby I had to change...

This lust for love
This love for lust
This lust, oh lust is helluva drug
This lust for love
This love for lust
This lust, oh lust is helluva—
