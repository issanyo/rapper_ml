[Intro: JaY STEEZ]
I'm feeling real good right now man
It's close encounters of The 3rd Kind

[Hook: JaY STEEZ & JaKK The Rhymer]
See, I'm a son of a gun
It's the JaY to the STEEZ, I'm a son of a gun
And a master of every trait under the sun
I talk sharp like a razor blade is under the tongue
Ya feel me?

Huh, and 4, 3, 2, 1
I'm the Black JaKK homie, such a son of a gun
And I mastered every trait under the Sun
I talk sharp like a razor blade

[Verse 1: JaY STEEZ]
Let's go!, look
You can't see me with the rhetoric, I be the best to spit
Respect the regiment or fail like the rest of them
And hadn't you win it
Back when Wayne dropped a Carter III
So start beef, and get washed, and hang out like laundry
I let you tumble dry, cats ain't touching mine
I always had a troubled mind equipped with some subtle lines
Bustah Rhymes, couldn't touch it and bring it
The word play is making cats wanna crutch for they triggers
So, somebody call the cops, you gotta semi auto cocked
Rocko got soul, with drive like an auto shop
Your orthodox can't compare to my south paw
I'm bout more, my sounds raw, and sound waves pound floors
So if you switchstance, I got quick hands
JaY STEEZ holds his own like kick-stands
In simple terms, I'm the illest with these written words
And rappers get concerned every time that I spit a verse, hearse

[Hook: JaY STEEZ & JaKK The Rhymer]
I'm a son of a gun
It's the JaY to the STEEZ, I'm a son of a gun
And a master of every trade under the Sun
I talk sharp like a razor blade is under the tongue

Huh, what, and 4, 3, 2, 1
I'm the Black JaKK homie, such a son of a gun
And I mastered every trade under the Sun
I talk sharp like a razor blade
Like a razor blade

[Verse 2: JaKK The Rhymer]
I be The Rhymer, and I'm known to rip it off the noggin
Rhymes crackle and vomiting listings often nodded
The brain is lost to find it off smoking cough and something
JaKK and STEEZ will take over time, but we exhaust that option
Plus the flow will never stay the beginner
And where the notes [?] on, I sever and split it
Bars hard to swallow, hit your gut, hammered your liver
It's like a magic show the way we turn pretenders to quitters
Then pop goes the weasel
Cam't stand the heat, then I suggest you breathe low
If you didn't notice by now
Truthfully we don't need no notepad, pen I'm a nomad when
The beat go off
Cut the lyric, paint the anchor, the pen burgundy red
And if you don't feel The 3rd Kind, you ain't heard of us yet
Trust me, we on this one, you catch, catch the next bus

[Hook: JaY STEEZ & JaKK The Rhymer]
See, I'm a son of a gun
It's the JaY to the STEEZ, I'm a son of a gun
And a master of every trait under the sun
Sharp like a razor blade is under the tongue
Ya feel me?

Huh, yo and 4, 3, 2, 1
I'm the Black JaKK homie, such a son of a gun
And I mastered every trade under the Sun
I talk sharp like a razor blade
Like a razor blade

[Outro: JaKK The Rhymer]
Ya mean?
We 'gon do it like this, we just 'gon rock out
Ya mean, feel the vibe, feel the good [?], i mean emotions
Ya know what i mean
It's hip hop in it's essence B
JaKK The Rhymer and JaY STEEZ, close encounters, CE
3K, whatever y'all know us as
You know what i'm saying? Yellow Tape
