[King Draft]
They got me feelin' like, I gotta get the light
Plate never lookin' lite, Animal appetite

[Swank]
You know the world is ours I kill em with plenty bars
All I do is eat, Remember I used to starve

[KD]
To get to where we are you gon' need more than a car
They kneeling at my feet they lookin' at a star

[S]
These niggas sellin' out, I'm not for sale at all
Sound like they in a drought do anything for some clout

[KD]
Just tryna build a buzz, light years ahead of cuz
You thought I wouldn't buzz bitch who you thought it was?

[S]
They must be trippin' right, can't let these niggas slide
I tell em' kick rocks these niggas must be high

[KD]
Talkin' Demi Lovato, we a tough act to follow
They never use they heads, these niggas sleepy hollow

[S]
We celebrating wins, yeah we poppin' bottles
You only live once, you niggas know the motto

[KD]
I know the motto, I modeled it till these no tomorrow
They in my shadow like pacifiers and baby bottles

[S]
Foot on the throttle, I'm lane switchin' my drive crazy
These other niggas they lack vision they eyes lazy

[Chorus] [x1]
[King Draft & Swank]
I've been waiting my whole life for this
It's on sight for this, risk my life for this
Know my worth, I might raise my price for this
Ain't no hype for this

[S]
Who you know flow better spit shit so clever fuck the weather
Even if the bitch cold won't sweater

[KD]
Nope never, If I see one imma go get her, she see king got a dream wanna be Coretta

[S]
Not in it for the fame bet you still know the name
Crazy what these nigga do for dollar bills and a chain

[KD]
I keep a bald fade 2 blade with the grain
Its a shame superfly kittyhawk with the plane

[S]
I'm up 30,000ft with the world beneath my feet flyin'
Don't try and compete nigga this is elite rhyming

[KD]
He ain't lying, whether corporate or keep iron
On hill of Lauren from here I can see Zion

[S]
3 from the ark shoot 3 through your heart
Niggas bumpin' they gums, we ceasing the talk

[KD]
You thought we wasn't gon' connect  no hope with the goat
I promise it ain't a threat

[S]
I put the gun to you, I let it sing you a song
It's a duet you know king had to bring me along

[KD]
True, that's right Swank these other niggas is pawns
We in the building, let these other niggas play on the lawn
It's like

[Chorus] [x1]
[King Draft & Swank]
I've been waiting my whole life for this
It's on sight for this, risk my life for this
Know my worth, I might raise my price for this
Ain't no hype for this
