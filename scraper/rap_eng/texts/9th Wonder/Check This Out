[Intro]
Okay
Okay
Okay
Okay
Okay okay okay okay
Okay okay okay okay
You might just see the boy on NBC
You gon envy me when I drop this fucking MP3
On you bitch niggas
On you bitch niggas

[Verse 1]
Gold teeth, backyard grilling
Feeling lifted, tryna stack up all this money to the motherfucking ceiling
All your bullshit I don't hear it
But I feel it in my spirit
Now I think I'm getting livid so lets get it, aye
We ain't no commodities, honestly
I think you're better off calling us prodigies, probably
We only came to take over the property properly, like we shopping, b
You think you stopping we? My nigga, what the motherFAWK you mean?
Jotting bars, manipulating pencils
Put the metaphorical pistol to your motherfucking temple
And pop you like you a pimple...
I'm balling while you fuck with whiffles
I would assist you but I got other issues, b
Me and this girl, we got history...
Beat the pussy up then watch some Mike Tyson mysteries
She aiming for that sweet taste of victory
That mouth do the nasty, it ain't never heard of Listerine

[Hook]
Okay, everybody check me out
Stunting in the mountains tryna make my momma proud
Started from a pouch, moved up to an ounce
With my eyes set on the pound and the motherfucking crown
You might just see the boy on NBC
You gon envy me when I drop this fucking MP3
I'm heading to the top at 700 mpg
So all you barricade niggas could just let me be, like...

[Verse 2]
Lord have mercy if you ever thought you could hurt me
I'm a shooter, I shoulda had Curry's 30 on a jersey
Turn it into a shirt ripped to pieces from all the work
That I apply to prove my worth, I am so motherfucking worthy
But I'm creative, you can feel free to say it, I'm nothing less than amazing
Just have some patience and I may become your favorite
All of these heinous haters think I don't know what I'm saying
But maybe they all just jealous cuz they know they ain't the greatest
All they do is ask for favors, Imma hit them with the stainless
Just ask me to kill you now and then trust that it won't be painless
Cuz you try too hard to be involved, you don't know how to deal with loss
...I mean it took a fucking verse for you to see your flaws
How does it feel to know you'll never get to be the boss?
You'd be in my position if you could spit until your teeth dissolves
I spit like a dragon, this fire would leave you lacking
I'm living proof that you can finesse with a little practice
What happened to me is magic, what happened to you is tragic
But that don't matter, the fact of the matter is I'm a savage
My bars are sharp but they swear that it can't hurt
When was the last time you remember me writing a bad verse?
This that shit that make an atheist run to his pastor
But the bastard won't spare his life cuz it's mad work
Spitting daggers until I'm down to my last word
Or til the rapture removes us from off this crass earth. Ox!

Okay, everybody look at me
Stunting cuz I'm tryna make my momma proud of me
Started from a seed, moved up to a weed
With my eyes set on the tree and the motherfucking green
You might just see the boy on NBC
You gon envy me when I drop this fucking MP3
I'm heading to the top at 700 mpg
So all you barricade niggas could just let me be, like...
