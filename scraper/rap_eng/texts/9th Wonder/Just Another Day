"It be that long beach california nigga, in long beach california, the city I was brought up, I never smelled success but man I love the oder, On a path to victory; I just keep straight like men marring women, I'm living life for today, becuz tommorrow I can be dead at any momment; just another mouring in the morning, they dont give a fuck and I dont give a fuck neither, trust if I get a deal, nigga its a rap like buruitto's, every time I'm in the booth I intend to spit ma spleen up, the maturity of a phenom, and these rappers for me to feed on, in that city by the sea, man that shit is too obseen: more than enough for you to see, police can stand for our shit I suggest them to have a seat, I recieve so much pussy, I probally can relate to a felion, I got dreams of being rich, whips europeon, thick bitch with lovely tits and this dick for her to have a seat on, I'm just another black nigga coming from the ghetto; that one out of a million, go and let ma cd bump, bump like blemishes, you would be lost for words like pages missing out of an encyclopedia, the type of shit I write when my mindstate oblivion, can't find a nine to five so it's food stamps off of Sants Fe or Imperial, caught in this scenario, but you should turn this up in yo stereo" - Anthony Banks
