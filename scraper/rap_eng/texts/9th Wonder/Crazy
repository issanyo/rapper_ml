Shit is crazy
Shit is crazy

[Verse 1]
Welcome to the jungle, the heart of the struggle
You starve if you humble, that’s part of the hustle
Dawg, where ya muzzle to quiet your barking?
I’ll be in all black tonight in your apartment
Or ya projects, or ya brownstone
I’m breaking it down, holmes. How it sound, holmes?
Demolition man, you should listen, man
I stay cool by choice, I got a list of fans
In my fist a gram, so I hold it tight
Call me Dolemite, I did it for dough and might
Do the same thing twice. Nah
In the wilderness of North America, I
Dig through the tunnels
Call me underground for now, but I got thousands above you
Shit, I would love to
Dude, did you ever think I would be here like hot 9; no clue
I got mine
Even though you got enough I still flex my rhymes

[Hook]
Shit is crazy
Shit is crazy

[Verse 2]
Welcome to the office, the spot where the boss is
Y’all take losses, I take precaution
My rate do often rise like the cautious
When you turn em on and your song be the worstest
Bring in the hearses, nurses, doctors
Can’t bring ya back from the shock cause
You got no heart, your heart stopped cause
It’s a rap for you, it’s no mack for you
Find your way back, duke
I’m the man in the mirror
That’ll reflect the real when you feel that you're iller
Killers, coming in the form of DT's
In the streets now running with thieves

[Hook]
Shit is crazy
Shit is crazy

[Verse 3]
Welcome to the coffin, the place where I often
See niggas tossing, you married, divorce him
He ain’t coming back. That nigga’s a boss by
The victim of the trap shot by a mall cop
A war is a battle between two things
Tryna live at the same time with these shoestrings
Never gets hotter, tied it or not
It’s a butterfly effect when the world just stop
I seen the rain come down as soon as somebody rise
Like yeast in the street, heat by the police
And the Jeep bulletproof on that ride
All you see is the lies point, like that’s the truth in that ride

[Hook]
Shit is crazy
Shit is crazy
