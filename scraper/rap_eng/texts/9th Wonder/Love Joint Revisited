[Intro]
Here in 2002, we present the fabulous love joint remix
Here we have two MC's, both of which are in physical form
And a producer in producarial essence
And we are coming through first with Phonte
C'mon

[Phonte]
Yo, Yo
Eh yo I love waking up with a supreme purpose
After a night of playing Dream Merchant
Righteous way, this a matter of extreme urgence
I love rap cause it seems earnest
Love this joint cause we reworked it
Love cell phones with free service
So I can call a broad, at E-haus
At UNC, downloaded all my freestyles
On desktop, hard drive, MP3 files
Screaming at the top of her lungs, "she loving me now"

[Big Pooh]
Eh yo, donny say the best love balance
A song for you and yours, make your mic fist pump valid
Late nights is a habit, drinking parme, making matic
Jakes leave, flicks gotta have it
I love Macho Man Randy Savage
Screaming Elizabeth come take a ride on my slim jim (oooh yeah)
I love Barry Heter, but it tells

[Phonte]
Just like I love Pac in Above The Rim
Cause this ain't a fable like the brothers grim
Love my niggas milk, grant, kurt, double M
Reppin NC, we keep it bubblin'
Punishin'

[Big Pooh]
Hate the players
I love ill doers and nay sayers
Freak broads, I'll holla later

[Hook: Phonte & Big Pooh]
Eh yo we ain't trying to willies or thugs in it
We just wanna spread love in it
We spread love y'all, all across the globe
We spread love all across the globe, we spread love all across the globe
And from the north to the south to the east to the west (yes, yes)
Steady keepin' it locked with no test
We spread love all across the globe, we spread love all across the globe

[Bridge: Phonte & Big Pooh]
And now what we want to do is get down with you
Whether your drug free or smoke a quarter pound or two
At the bar ordering another round or two
We know we like the way it sound to you (the way it sound to who)

[Big Pooh]
It's Big Pooh from the leather state
I love philly's and cheese stakes
I love records when the beat breaks
I love school when the heat breaks
Fire hydrants making street lakes
I love 22 it feels great
Mike Tyson and his outtakes, stepping out with the fly date

[Phonte]
So fans get ready for the outbreak
Cause we gon' do it with or without tapes
Even if I rhyme until my mouth aches
For all the people that I bond wit
Playin' for big stakes, on same Angus Barn shit
Even if you want this, get right
That's why I love wack niggas, thanks for making my shit sound so tight

[Big Pooh]
Because we gotta get down tonight

[Big Pooh & Phonte]
With no beef, no clones, no biters or soundalikes

[Phonte]
It ain't no ice, grills, or frowns tonight

[Big Pooh]
I put my love in this, I swear never to put down the mic

[Phonte]
This one is for the ladies and gents
That's partying and paying the rent, with life just gets too intense

[Big Pooh]
Cause it ain't all about trying to ball

[Big Pooh & Phonte]
Get yo' hands up now cause we still got love for y'all

[Hook: Phonte & Big Pooh]

[Phonte]

And to my man Big Pooh, you don't stop

And to my man Vibrant, you don't stop
