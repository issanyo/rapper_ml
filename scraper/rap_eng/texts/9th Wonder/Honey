[Intro]
We hope you enjoyed your train ride
From this point, ladies and gentlemen
You're on your own
New Amerykah 4th World War
Please stay tuned
For New Amerykah, Pt. 2: Return of the Ankh
Please stay tuned for more
Your special ingredient, Honey
10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2
Two and a half
One, thank you

[Verse 1]
So tell me Slim, what you wanna do?
When you know I'm in love with you
Every time that I turn around
Look for you but you can't be found
Fly free baby, fine with me
I'm in love with a bumblebee
Ooh Slim, boy you killin' me
But you so sweet to me, oww

[Chorus]
Honey, you so sweet (honey)
Sugar got a long way to catch you
You so sweet (honey)
All I gotta do is add a little lemon
You my favorite drink
Hey, you make me think
Oww
Honey, yeah boy
You so sweet

[Verse 2]
So tell me Slim, what's it gonna be?
It don't be like this usually
When it come to that, "what it do?"
I don't fall for that "whoop-tee-woo"
Ooh boy can you tell me please?
Wanna know if you feelin' me
Ooh Slim, boy you killin' me
But you so sweet to me, oww

[Chorus]
Honey, you so sweet (honey)
Sugar got a long way to catch you
You so sweet (honey)
All I gotta do is add a little lemon
You my favorite drink
Hey, you make me think
Oww
Honey, yeah boy
You so sweet (honey)

[Pre-Chorus]
You got that honey
You running from me
You really turn me on
You got that honey
Stop acting funny
You really turn me on

Uh, look

[Verse 3]
So tell me Slim, what you tryin' to do?
I'm tryin' to get me an interview
Look for you all over town
But you gave me the run-around
Fly free baby, fine with me
I need to know if you're feelin' me
Can you stick your pinky finger in my tea
Cause you so sweet to me, oh

[Chorus]
Honey, you so sweet (honey)
Sugar got a long way to catch you
You so sweet (honey)
All I gotta do is add a little lemon
You my favorite drink
Hey, you make me think
Oww
Honey, yeah ooh oh oh
You so sweet (honey)

[Outro/Pre-Chorus]
You got that honey
You running from me
You really turn me on
You got that honey
Stop acting funny
You really turn me on

You got that honey
You running from me
You really turn me on
You got that honey
Stop acting funny
You really turn me on
