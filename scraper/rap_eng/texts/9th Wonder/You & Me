[Intro]
I pour it out
I pour it out
I unzipped my heart and I pour it out (x2)
You and me were meant huh
Do a little something together
Figured you know
Kick it to you in verse form
Instead of kicking it to you in person

[Verse 1]
To start it off ma
Am at a crossroads
Cause I ain't sure which way that this is gonna go
See on one hand it seems so positive
Then on the other am lost but then the opposite
Far from a sucker for love
But I kinda adore you
Knew it the munite I first saw you
Started with a couple of plugs
Then you started to fall through
Couple days a week it was all you
Then you caught feelings and I caught feelings
We got scared like am I supposed to feel this
But you and me were meant huh
To be together in the best way
We can't live life wondering about the next day
But you don't how scared I am
To let you get next to Sky
You don't know the stress that I remember
But still in all you looking like you the best in line
So maybe you the best to Sky's contenders
Cause in the past when they spaz
Sky would dip em
And that's why I think twice when you kiss me
At the same time any night I want you with me

[Hook]
You and me were meant, uh, to be together, and I know you scared, ma
But ain't nothing wrong with taking it there, ma
And I'm just as nervous as you
But if anybody's worth it, it's you... and me

Keep pouring it, keep pouring it!

[Verse 2]
They say the first two weeks consist of the most smiles
Tryna get to know your curves and profile
And every little thing you did I took notice
Remembering the shit that I said to get you open
Just so I can say it again to keep you right here
And eventually leading to your night wear
You was playing good girl but you gave in
I redecorated your walls and they caved in
I took care of them dreams you was saving
Day by day by day
Even outside the sheets we was kinda complete
Just as long you was riding with me
I felt something like down South cook food
And you too you was coat check hook boo
Lets just say we was both sprung cool
Then we started to care a little more
I can hear your heart beating clear when you talk
And all the above are signs of a relationship
And I ain't even meant to take this trip

[Hook]

Keep pourin it
Keep pourin it
But now we known each other long enough
But am still not sure what to call us
Can't tell if what we feel is strong enough
But I know when am with you its all us

[Hook]
