[Verse]
I told sis I'm about to do some real hot iddish with this music in a minute, she didn't listen
Kinda hurt my feelings in an instant, I just wanted attention, and she can really give it if she's drifted
She saw me from the window in the kitchen, sitting in the car outside, getting high and steady scribing
Tryna get this iddish off my mind [?]
Then she dives into my space like she didn't see the sign
"Please don't disturb, I'm at work, the nerve for you to come here with an attitude", I had to hurt her pride
"Like, don't you see my paper and my pen and my focus, and I'm [?}? Well, don't bother me, baby, I need my privacy
Must convince the world there's no one live as me, I'm up against some real rough cats, like Riff Raff, they from the garbage, see?
And I'm the [?] here, the orange kid
Nah, not Heathcliff, more like a Sun that Erica was diggin'
I'll be back inside in like a minute"
She looked into my eyes like she was listening, should've swore she took it in
"Don't speak", no doubt, yeah, like the one with Leg and 'em
"Now I got my train of thought back, don't ruin it again!"
Returning to my thoughts before they drifted off, I'm tryin'
Now I'm scribing my [?], my sentences, I can't forget it
Just when I remembered and forgot and then remembered
She interrupted again and just ruined the iddish
Damn...
