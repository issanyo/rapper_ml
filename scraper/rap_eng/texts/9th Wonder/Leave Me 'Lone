[Intro]
Yeah, 9th Wonder
The Black Mamba
I am rap nigga
Yo

[Hook]
The grind don't ever stop, look how I'm going strong
Promise her wheels and I will before it's all gone
Leave it in wills if it kills me, I keep pushing on
Pushing my buttons, these motherfuckers better leave me alone
Filet mignon, my future at stake
First thing on my plate is work, I got money to make

[Verse 1: Rapsody]
Got the attention of greats, but on the list they don't name me
Cause a threat to your neck, to your check it, it don't pay me
Give fuck what a rain be, not worry the drought
Flow wet like the night I got it in on the couch
A lot niggas [a vouch], name good in the street
Catch me reaching for a milli like that nigga young Meek
I got my mind on a milli and I ain’t had a milli to [?]
So focused, it like a milli for the [family you ?]
Diss on my hoes similar heat, had the door like a wreath
Kick that bitch in and bring in all of my peeps

[Bridge]
Jamla the squad, Tiffany A-rob
Bout to tell these motherfuckas what to do with they blah
My nigga
Jamla the squad, huh

[Verse 2]
Shit, I’m just [?itting] Big Krit
Still got hoes in the whip
High like a palm trees on the strip
Miami, all these niggas is whipped
When it comes bar for bar, you more bitch
Than a bitch you calling a bitch
There ain't no way you getting rich wit yo rhymes
I’m just droppin you dimes, knowledge
Shit they can't teach you in college
Played out [?]
I’m forever like Wallace
Drop shit without [?]
I’m not what Minaj is, no disrespect
If she [?] that I'm loving, all you niggas is ballin
Yo, we balance each other, my nigga
She doing her thing, she fill her pockets with skrilla
Came up in the game, tell it to them niggas in Thriller
Blowers to killers, looking like [?] de Villa
My niggga my nigga
Support the niggas you digging
Say divided we fall, therefore we best off [?]
We say [?] it's to hard to listen
But we carry on cooking, niggas back in the kitchen
Word to Annette de [?], my niggas

[Hook x2]
The grind don't ever stop, look how I'm going strong
Promise her wheels and I will before it's all gone
Leave it in wills if it kills me, I keep pushing on
Pushing my buttons, these motherfuckers better leave me alone
Filet mignon, my future at stake
First thing on my plate is work, I got money to make
