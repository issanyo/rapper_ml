[THAI:]
North Eastside Portland, gang banging advocate
Laos, Cambodian, Vietnamese is who I'm banging with
No surrender, no retreat aim the burners on em
Death before dishonor is the only fucking motto
Been this way since a kid, earned all my stripes
Made my way up, now everything is organized
Connected with my USOs, VN down in san jo
We worldwide, mob shit, runnin with 454
Money to the sky, ain't nobody could compete
If you ain't ready to die, then you ain't ready to beef
We run the game, we run the streets, we be running the industry
We everything that you seek what you suckers pretend to be
I'm a beast where I'm from, cousin that's no lie
Got my middlefingers up for you pussies that wanna try
I'm a beast where I'm from, cousin that's no lie
Got my middlefingers up for you pussies that wanna try
THAI

[HOOK: Drew Deezy (Thai) x2]
I ball hard and my niggas in the same gang
We do it big and my niggas do the same thang
(I'm throwing signs, and you're looking cuz I gangbang)
(I'm from a hood, where everybody gangbang)

[DREW DEEZY:]
I gang bang and my niggas do the same thang
I'm iced out and my niggas got the same chain
I get money on em! (money on em)
Timin' on em! (timin' on em)
Gucci down to the socks, uce I'm stylin' on em
You hear the money machine, cousin I'm pilin' on em
Disrespect the S uce, I'm ridin' on em
I got a 6th sense, I see dead faces
In the wall in a safe, yeah different places
Real street nigga, I love the lifestyle
I gets it in, I'm chasing money right now
I'm certified everywhere I go
Ask them usos in the beach if they fuckin' with San Jo
I'm a beast where I'm from, cousin that's no lie
Got my middlefingers up for you pussies that wanna try
I'm a beast where I'm from, cousin that's no lie
Got my middlefingers up for you pussies that wanna try
