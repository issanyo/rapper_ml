Baby, tell me if you want that
Tell me I go get that
This love is 50/50 we gonna split that
Baby, tell me if you want that
Tell me I go get that
This love is 50/50 we gonna split that

Tenelle:
Baby, you are all I need you are to me
Baby, you are all I need (ever need) you are to me

Drew Deezy:
Half of this is yours and the other half is mine
You can have the clock I just wanna buy your time
I'm seeing things different it's because my love is blind
Put a pistol to my head cause you know you blow my mind
Earth is your playground and I'm just trying to slide
Maybe we can swing when you ready touch the sky
Cause this love is 50 but not like Curtis Jackson
It's more like Richie Valentine (?) before the crashin'
Any questions ask it, it's your honesty I'm asking
If you're running game then I suggest you start passing
Cause I ain't ever been the one to play the game
This is down the middle cause I drive it down the lane
When it's 50/50 I expect just that
But even if it's (?) I'm on the way, I'm not mad
Is this the definition of what's really of a man
Cause reality is a beach but I'm glad we in the sand

Drew Deezy:
If we're 50/50 then you are my better half
Cause together we 100 and they better do the math
People talkin' garbage is the reason why they trash
We don't belong together if you can't accept my past
If you love me you gonna take me with my flaws and all
You can take it all, all these walls I'mma take em off
Take a piece of me every time I break you off
Take a loss get it back, boy, I been a boss
I ain't worried about the cost cause my money up
We ain't put in all this work just to be one-upped
Go against the line, cush make them enough
We makin' noise but they don't know that we just comin' up

Fiji:
Tell me giving me heart and soul
Come make you lose control
Keep you loving loving loving me tell me (?)
Now we're (?) I run everything
When those (?) approach me give 'em the gangster swing
Simmer down, simmer down
You know this love is made for making smile not frown
Every time we touch (?) you sit here making sexy, sexy
Finally (?) I come around
