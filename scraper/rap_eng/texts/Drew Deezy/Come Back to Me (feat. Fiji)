Ohhhhh oohhhhh
Ohhhhhh ooohhhh

Come back to me my love
Cuz Im missing you bad
Tell me what is gonna take for you
To come back to me my love
Cuz im missing you bad
And I wanna know I wanna know

Yeah...
Foi mai foi mai pele ea
Thats what your crying to me when im not there
You make it seem as if i dont care
Like the chances i take is not there
Like me being the way dont crush me
I just dont want us to end up in crush dreams
I know you question my moves
But trust me
Gotta believe in each other to succeed
Cuz progression is nothing without you
Pursue to happiness baby it takes two
So im right before the woman you are
And theres nothing that could tear us apart
Baby you are my heart
