(Tokouso movement)
(Listen ladies)

[Hook]
Please pardon me, if I wasn’t craving enough attention
I’m just discreet, it’s a Polynesian affection
Sometimes it’s hard, to show your true feelings as a warrior
So forgive me, for being respectful to my queen warrior

[Verse 1]
See I don’t mean to cause no drama
I don’t mean no disrespect
I just wanna be the lover of your Polynesian hips
Way you shake it, way you movin
Where’s that call from your sweet lips?
Make a baller wanna order bottles so that you can [swing?]
They gettin juicy like a rib-eye
Let me put my sauce on
Place that you can dinner
Baby I’m a boss aw
C’mon put it on put it up on me now
Like this tokouso movement strictly ? on me now

[Hook]

[Verse 2] [Drew Deezy]
Is you tired? Is you havin a long day?
I would’ve been here sooner but I went the wrong way
It’s heavy what you carryin so put it on me
No matter what we do or what we say THEY gon hate
See now I be singing mellow
Baby who is you here fo’
Roll a cigarello
Don’t believe whatchu hear tho
It’s this pakalolo, everything ain’t for me tho
Keep it on the low low, they might as well leave tho

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Strictly dedicated to all my pacific island queens
If you’re with one boy you made it, you’ll fulfill all of your dreams
Be protective of our women, that’s the warrior in me
She’s the reason why our ancestors traveled across the sea
Every time she dance the hula (tears from my eyes fall)
She don’t care about the mula (she’s there for the long haul)
C’mon put it on put it up on me now
Like this tokouso movement strictly ? on me now
