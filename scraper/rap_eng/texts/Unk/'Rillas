[Intro]

[Verse 1: WavvyLord]
G-Shocks in two colors these new brothers ain't worth game
Flip G's no Bruce Lee hood V.P. that's Wavy
Squad like these rangers some actors on deck
Four-Four to the dome face my problems all alone
Yes ho that's a bando
I'm whippin' dishes no hands though
Cash flow like nosebleeds but the nosebleed don't ever cease
Got a queen she in the cut
Size 22 when I measure that butt
Size X-L when she wearin' my shit
God be the savior if this my last chick
Nigga what's up if you talkin' that walk
Walking that talk like Incredible Hulk
Costco I'm murkin' straight hard for the bulk
Peeping the feds when they pull up for the stalk
Girlies want me cause I'm tall
I'ma call back like a recall
No refund that's a rerun of my past
Skip class
Touchdown I hit you with that knowledge pass

[Hook: WavvyLord]
Every single day living like a team
White drinks purple juice all up in my lean
Money team cash gang
Balling, (MoiMoi: "Woo")
My gorillas they stay shot calling

[Verse 2: Wicked Prophet]
First time I've written
Damn I'm so wicked
Your mouth is left dry from when I start spittin'
Jaw hit the floor
Just closed the door
We're already fuckin' you're not welcome no more
No turning back
Just like a ray
Nigga we rappin' like everyday
I hear you talk
Fuck what you say
The prophet is speakin' so quiet you stay
Making the bank
Climbing in rank
Fuck all your reggie
The squad is on dank
Trying to get turnt
Is this nigga hurt
If he about to slump
We give em that work
I am the ninja
Why are you hiding
Lord of the waves my nigga Poseidon
I see you lean like purple and sprite
Even with telescope im outta sight
Chilling at home
All in my zone
Usually don't write just straight off of the dome
Got Wavy and Bittah-Kamal in the cut
We killing these niggas and don't give a fuck
Most of the shit you spit is O.K.,
If my lines aren't on top then they get thrown away

[Hook: WavvyLord]
Every single day living like a team
White drinks purple juice all up in my lean
Money team cash gang
Balling, (MoiMoi: "Woo")
My gorillas they stay shot calling

[Verse 3: UNK]
Riding through southeast with my fucking niggas
Counting up the stacks
You know we just making big figures
You know your favorite rapper be the number two spitter
Cause I am the number one certified top hitter
Over here getting so gone off these fucking flights
And my niggas over there just gettin' gone off that wax
And if you need some my nigga B hit you up with that thrax
And I'm tryna make hits on these niggas
Man they better duck
Rollin' real slow abandoned road in my all black truck
Cause niggas out here out here tryna always catch a nigga lackin'
And I'm gettin' a quarter two-five
Back like I'm sackin' on these hoes and beats
That's all we really tryna jock
And you know they stay ridin' on my motherfuckin' cock
And you know these niggas always just see me posted on the block
With the full gang over here coolin' with their Glocks
Quan over here pushin' that old work lookin' like it's powdered chalk
Spendin' and chargin' a hundred like my name was Tony Hawk

[Hook: WavvyLord]
Every single day living like a team
White drinks purple juice all up in my lean
Money team cash gang
Balling, (MoiMoi: "Woo")
My gorillas they stay shot calling
