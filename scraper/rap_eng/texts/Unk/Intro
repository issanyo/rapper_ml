[DJ Jelly]
Welfare check one, welfare check two
That's right we gon' give it to 'em
This yo' favorite DJ's DJ, DJ Jelly
And I got me a new member of the Oomp Camp
DJ Unk (DJ Unk hoe!) But I ain't gon' talk no more
DJ Montae, Oomp Camp this shit, niggahhhhhh~!

{*scratched repeatedly: "DJ Unk hoe"*}

[Unk]
Yo
Yo, yo
Yo
Yo, yo
Since when the last time, you got your money's worth
D-boys in two songs, niggas I got that Nelly curse
So dig down in your purse, the wait no longer here
The type of niggas, type of killers bootleggers fear
Now they may rock the party, see me I'm off the yam
They bought a dub or two, I'm like a thousand grams
My pistol in my hand, I'm confiscatin rocks-es
No SoundScans nigga I'ma see my pockets
So lay it down player, your face to the flo'
You do yo' dance baby girl bend your back low
See you can ride to it, might even drop a tear
I'm smokin sticky bubble kush album of the year
Watch how they talk about me, watch how I set up shop
I'm DJ Unk, Legal Records, beat'n down yo block
Watch how they talk about me, watch how I set up shop
I'm DJ Unk, Legal Records, beat'n down yo block

[repeat 2X]
They say they waitin on it, so we gon' give it to 'em
They say they waitin on it, so we gon' give it to 'em
They say they waitin on it, so we gon' give it to 'em
They say they waitin on it, so we gon' give it to 'em
