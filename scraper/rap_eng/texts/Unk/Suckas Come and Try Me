[Chorus]
Suckas come and try me, they gon' find yo body
Suckas come and try me, they gon' find yo body
Suckas come and try me, they gon' find yo body
Suckas come and try me, they gon' find yo body

[Verse 1: Parle']
If a nigga try me, then he gon' die
I keep my two cocked like Deebo's eyes
And when I draw down
I ain't tryin' to scare you
I make you 1, 2, step like that name Ciara
Put yo vest 'round yo head
Protect yo face
I been gettin' money like collection plates
I put yo face on a shirt
In the front of the front page
Try me if you wanna
I got more nines then fourth grade
I re-up on the first, then again on the third
I'm in the hood like a fire hydrant, sittin' on the curb
And I got heart, I got grain and I got pills boy
I'm on the block posted up like a billboard
And I got that torch, so you know that I blast metal
If you went away, we steppin' on you like a gas pedal
And I got that linen squeeze so I grip my pipe
Most these niggas mad how we shinin' like some bright lights

[Chorus]
Suckas come, suckas come, sucka suckas come and try me
Suckas come, suckas come, sucka suckas come and try me
Suckas come, suckas come, sucka suckas come and try me
Suckas come, suckas come, sucka suckas come and try me
Suckas come and try me, they gon' find yo body
Suckas come and try me, they gon' find yo body
Suckas come and try me, they gon' find yo body
Suckas come and try me, they gon' find yo body

[Verse 2: DJ Unk]
I got hoes fo' days, dro fo' days
A choppa that sprays and I keep that throw-away
Sucka niggas wanna try, yo ass goin die
6 feet under the dirt, you lie
So duck when I buss, I shot yo ass off angle
Dripping blood on my shoes, dry yo ass on a hanger
We the truth, Oomp Camp, franchise lets get it
These niggas softer than some snuggles and some big ass titties
I keep the croon piece nigga and my fingers stay flicking
They say I need some Benadryl 'cause that bitch stay itching
It's getting hot in my kitchen I stay cookin', I'm bad
Get mad, I have you redder than a maxi pad
Maceo told you niggas 'bout fucking with dreads
I gotta clique of niggas ready to put one in yo head
Stretch you out on the bed and slap a tag on yo toe
I told you niggas 'bout fucking with Big Oomp, hoe

[Chorus]
Suckas come, suckas come, sucka suckas come and try me
Suckas come, suckas come, sucka suckas come and try me
Suckas come, suckas come, sucka suckas come and try me
Suckas come, suckas come, sucka suckas come and try me
Suckas come and try me, they gon' find yo body
Suckas come and try me, they gon' find yo body
Suckas come and try me, they gon' find yo body
Suckas come and try me, they gon' find yo body

[Verse 3: Pimpin]
I stay in the mall, niggas wonder why I shop a lot
They call me bubble gum, 'cause a nigga like to pop a lot
Them diamonds gliss a lot, keep my tool round hot
Got the choppa' in the trunk so everybody gettin' shot
I might pull up in yo hood, DJ Unk out the T-top
If you ain't got no pistol I hope you strapped up yo Reeboks
If niggas want beef, I'm a give him what he askin'
That choppa clear the block (Clear the block) like Pro Active
If I got a big rocket, help me take off like a jet man
Call me Wolverine 'cause I'm connected with the X man
Call me Wolverine 'cause I'm connected with the X man
Call me Wolverine 'cause I'm connected with the X man
And I got a lil' money and a nigga still ain't change
But I had to step it up, feeling like LeBron James
I gave the shit a break and got the count on the beat
Bitch I never did construction but got them blocks on the street
Everywhere that I go, I got my nine right beside me
If niggas think I'm playin', then nigga come and try me

[Chorus]
Suckas come and try me, they gon' find yo body
Suckas come and try me, they gon' find yo body
Suckas come and try me, they gon' find yo body
Suckas come and try me, they gon' find yo body
Suckas come and try me, they gon' find yo body
Suckas come and try me, they gon' find yo body
Suckas come and try me, they gon' find yo body
Suckas come and try me, they gon' find yo body
Suckas come and try me, they gon' find yo body
Suckas come and try me, they gon' find yo body
Suckas come and try me, they gon' find yo body
Suckas come and try me, they gon' find yo body
Suckas come and try me, they gon' find yo body
Suckas come and try me, they gon' find yo body
Suckas come and try me, they gon' find yo body
Suckas come and try me, they gon' find yo body
