[Unk]
Now what we doin (smokin sticky sticky) damn right

[Chorus: repeat 8X]
Now what we doin (smokin sticky sticky) damn right

[Unk]
I blow kush, but when I blow my kush my kush rolled tight
Smokin purp, burnin orange, but just don't fuck with white
Sippin lean, system mean, Mary J on my team
Smokin that teen, tote that beam, Oomp Camp live on my screen
There go 12~! Straight up they smell that shit, they gon' take you away
Shouldn't be, not today, two shots of the Big Oomp spray
Super mango wanna tango AK'll break your ankles
Eyes wrinkled, smokin chokin, put up your middle fanger
Sippin 'gnac, whip the 'llac, some trippin smokin that
Two puffs of the kush, you disrespect, I bet it bend your back
Oomp smoke that shit that make you say man what the fuck was that
Put up your lighter, blaze that fire, and keep rollin fat
Now what we doin (smokin sticky sticky) damn right

[Chorus]

[Unk]
Smoke purp on the weekend, big blunt steady chiefin
Fat stacks steady countin, fifth wheel on the back end
24's stop and they spin, let the 'dro blow through the wind
Tell your partner match one end, seven grams well then put in
Well you ain't smokin my friend, blunt stays right in my hand
My green just cain't end, so by the way back end
Got niggas way back then, five dollars started rappin
They smell the haze but when it comes to beef get the guns start clappin
Oomp Camp stay snappin, too force to ever tell 'em back in
Put the fire on the ass of the weed inhale it just breathe in
I say - Oomp Camp stay snappin, too force to ever tell 'em back in
Put the fire on the ass of the weed inhale it just breathe in
Now what we doin (smokin sticky sticky) damn right

[Chorus]

Smokin sticky sticky...
