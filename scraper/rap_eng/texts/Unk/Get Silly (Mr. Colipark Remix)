[Chorus: V.I.C. & Soulja Boy]
Get Silly, Get Silly
Get Silly, Get Silly (Yall boys I luv man, step it up man)
Get Silly, Get Silly (S.O.D Money Gang and Collipark tomorrow)
Get Silly, Get Silly (Yall watch this, check this out right here)

[Verse 1: V.I.C.]
Yeeeaaaahhhhh
I'm feeling myself
And with the number one single I am feeling my wealth
Yeeeaaaahhhhh
Now what'chu know about me
Call me mister 08, cause this year about me
Now I'm the rookie of the year, but I'm major in the league
So HA you know it haters stay away from me
You don't wanna see the chopper when them boys get silly
And they rangin on yo block and yo brains like chillay

[Verse 2: Soulja Boy]
My chain too silly, my watch to dumb
Only rapper on Myspace with more friends than Tom
One for the money, two for the count
Riding in a vehicle I can't even pronounce
S.O.D. Money Gang (gang), money keep stacking
And I leaked every song and still went platinum
Fruit Loops silly candy painted flavored cars
You are a prisoner behind these eight bars

[Chorus: V.I.C. & Bun B]
Get Silly, Get Silly
Get Silly, Get Silly (We here to talk them down)
Get Silly, (Yeah), Get Silly
Get Silly, Get Silly

[Verse 3: Bun B]
Ok it's big Bun-Beater baby Southern OG (G)
I'm Pimp C's brother, everybody knows me (me)
Coming from the P.A.T., with mister V.I.C
Young Mogul E.N.T., if you don't like it eat a D
I got ringtone this, and ringtone that (that)
Try to label southern dance music ringtone rap (rap)
They capping on the cool but ain't a damn thing funny
They ain't hatin on the music (music), they hatin on the money (money)

[Verse 4: E-40]
Ooh, ooh
My house so silly (silly), my money so silly (silly)
I make mo in a week then your parent's do yearly (yearly)
My ring so silly (silly), my ice so silly (silly)
The rocks on my watch make the haters wanna kill me (kill me)
The hundred round drum on my gun so dumb (dumb)
That it will fly yo head all the way to London
I'm sick with it like Lil Weezy I'm a Millle (Millie)
Gotta short fuse and I'm throwin like a fizzbie

[Chorus: V.I.C.]
Get Silly, Get Silly
Get Silly, Get Silly
Get Silly, Get Silly
Get Silly, Get Silly

[Verse 5: DJ Unk]
YAH!
You already know yo boy UNK stay up in my biz-ay
The fellas in the back that was me twisting that filly
My charm too silly, my flow's just silly
Plus I keep the grand daddy purp at my shows I'm silly
They recognize me from Atlanta straight up to Philliy
Went from nobody to fortune plus my fame is silly
I can't even eat without signing my name (that's silly)
I can't even sleep without getting some brain (that's silly)

[Verse 6: Polow Da Don & Jermaine Dupri]
V.I.C., Collipark, POLOW DA DON (Get Money)
Pretty ladies (get silly) shake yo Double D (titties)
All my thugs throw it up if you a G off in yo (city)
Suck a nigga (try to rob me) had to get a bust a (missi)
(Wait a minute mothafucka) Then I got a call from Diddy
Then I got a call from fifty, then I gotta call from Jimmy
Then I got a call from Jack like I'm bout to make a millie
(Ooh wee) Christina Millie (Ooh Wee) You lookin pretty
(Ooh Wee, lemme get that) You need to holla the next time you in my city

[Verse 7: Jermaine Dupri]
They call me the leader of the silly shit jus ask my counting
Ya'll niggas make it rain I call my shit the water fountain
Because that with a push of a button shawty, you could get more
Homie, why they think they leave you when I walk through the door?
If I had to compare myself to any I'm something like a Spartan
Jay be the big stage in the A since Martin
Double rock the College Park, I mean what more can I say?
I switch my chain with my car, switch my car by the day
So fuck what'cha heard, I'm the man girlfriend
Pulling up in the race cars this nigga just gotta benz
He on 106 new joint I'm a MTV big ten
And after this he ain't never goin see yo ass again
I'm too silly
