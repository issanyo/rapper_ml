[Intro: Snoop & Daz]
Busta ass niggas, busta ass niggas
Let's ride on they ass
I'll be back in about 30 minutes
Long beach city, nigga!
Get your ass in the car, nigga!

We won, we won, and then we shot that BB gun
And they lost, and they lost
Now we took they shit, now it's time to floss

[Verse 1: Kurupt]
Before I even step, motherfuckers hit the deck
I gets wreck with a Tec so cash in like checks, fool
I gots my own back in a scrap
But if it calls for that I got my nigga Kenny Mack (biatch)
Swift as the wind, the Mac 10's in my niggas clutches
So bust this, we rush this
Punk ass nigga, I knew he was a fucking punk
So then I tapped Daz, go and pop the fucking trunk
He steps back in with the Tec
And I'm all pumped, puffing on blunts, ready to get wreck
Even though I knew he had a Mac 10, know I gave a fuck
And stuck the Tec out the window ready to let loose
Get some gin and juice, and then tell Snoop to come scoop
Check me out, peep how all who withstand
Step so quick and slowly sink like quicksand
Murder, that's what I be yellin'
I'm peeping your people, now two fuckin' hoods done bailed in
Wonderin' if he's G or a B.G, sporting locs and a beanie
Trying to mad dog, you can't see me
Now I could bust a cap and split em up
Or ready to get em up
I said, "What that Dogg Pound like, nigga?" then I hit 'em up
Now you niggas know what's up with Kurupt (right)
Niggas don't give a fuck, I'm headed for the Westside

[Bridge: Snoop & Daz]
Now this spot's owned by the motherfucking D.O. double G
P.O.U.N.D. so I see no other choice
But to roll with the homicide
For all this drama, make you and your momma die

[Chorus: Daz & Snoop]
This is Dogg Pound for life
This is Dogg Pound for life
Nigga, I just don't give a fuck
This is Dogg Pound for life
Nigga, this is Dogg Pound for life
Nigga, we just don't give a shit

[Verse 2: Daz Dillinger]
Now before I bails, I blaze up a few sacks
Freshly zig-zag wrapped and grab my cavy sack
Tote a strap in my lap because the feud is on
One of these niggas got caught slipping
Now the Eastside's a war zone
Known, for the OG's, the D.O.G's, L.O.C.s
Selling cavy on the spots, late nights
Who gives a fuck about another nigga, this Tha Pound for life
I got the biggest, fattest, rocks on any block
Sellin' my dubs like crazy and the sales never stop
I saw my paper stacking so I had to rush me a Benz, shit
I love the life that I live
Yeah, was the greatest of them all (a hustler)
I ran my game like a gangster, had no room for no busters
It musta been like a dream
I moved from sacks to grams, from Oz's to ki's (big balls)
Now I'm known through the hood as the O.G
Never known no more cavy car, no B.G
I put this sag down, I put my bang down
I start to set trip (why?) 'cause this is Dogg Pound
So now you know about that nigga D.A.Z
(And where you from?) Eastside 'til I dizzie, L.B.C

[Chorus: Daz & Snoop]
This is Dogg Pound for life
This is Dogg Pound for life
Nigga, I just don't give a fuck
This is Dogg Pound for life
This is Dogg Pound for life
Muthafucka, I just don't give a fuck
This is Dogg Pound for life
This is Dogg Pound for life
Call it what you want, Dogg Pound's the gang
This is Dogg Pound for life
This is Dogg Pound for life
Nigga, we just don't give a shit (biatch)

[Verse 3: Snoop Doggy Dogg]
Meditate to my flow, as I mob down the road
Yo, boy is it loony where the grass is greener
187 ain't shit but a misdemeanor
I've seen a lot of niggas come up, a few niggas done up
Some rest in peace with their khakis heavy creased
But it's an Eastside thang, a who-ride thang
If we bang to the boogie then we boogie to the bang
I bring you the muthafuckin' .38
Just get the emcee and my homie Nate
So we can ride, slide, slippety slide
As I take you on a trip, nigga, ride, Eastside

[Chorus: Daz & Snoop]
This is Dogg Pound for life
This is Dogg Pound for life
Nigga, we still don't give a fuck
This is Dogg Pound for life
This is Dogg Pound for life
Muthafucka, we still don't give a fuck

[Outro]
You will lie in hell
Where your dead homeboys dwell
There's no way to escape
There's no way you can escape
So rest in peace, bitch
Anybody's killa
Dogg Pound Gangstaz
