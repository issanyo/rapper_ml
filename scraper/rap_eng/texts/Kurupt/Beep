[Verse 1]
While I’m rubbing on her thigh I arrive, I settle in
She’s in love with a thug, I’m a gentleman
Hard in the game, she looking for excitement in her life
That’s right tonight alright, alright
Tight like a plummer, log like lumber
Here’s my number every summer we can meet up on the under
On the low she go beep beep beep
On the low a couple more before I skeet skeet skeet
Like hey lil mama your girlfriend’s popping
She’s the type I like pop up, you the momma I’m the poppa
Let’s play a little house you know I’m a boss like Ross
Everyday I’m hussle in city game, coast
I make the chevrolet shine like Bentley
She couldn’t wait till we get to the spot she on me
Come to california with me where the Gs is
So I can make it pop all up on this remix, (remix, remix)
(beep beep beep beep beep)

[Chorus]
Shawty been eyeing me
She looking like she thinking about trying me
She want it she can’t take no more
I’m bout to take her to my spot, I’m a get it hot
She goin, she goin, she goin

[Verse 2]
Hey Baby, my name ain't important
Uhh, For now you can call me the motion
Yay I need love like an orphan
So I can be your Bugga boo no archan
Little mama let me beep beep like a motorola
Now I’m in love knee deep like but it’s at her shoulders
But being I’m a G try a peak approach
But I swear shawty got me weak like the weekend over
From the windows to the walls she get even lower
Yea, she got the game I’m just try’n keep the score
Shit I rather beep like a freakin horn and keep it blowin
Yeah! It go beep beep beep
She got traffic in the back of her pants
So I gotta pull up on her bumper and beep, beep, beep
Hehehe
Excuse me miss, but sexy can I
Take you to my crib and make love on my piano
Yeah you know me, little shawty from Atlanta
I wanna do somethings to you
Touch your body make you get naughty
Say my name when I beep, beep, beep
We can do it in the pool or the jeep, jeep, jeep
Caz girl you know you turning me on

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Shawty been eyeing me
She looking like she thinking about trying me
She want it she can’t take no more
I’m bout to take her to my spot, I’m a get it hot
She goin, she goin, she goin
Let me beep, beep, beep, beep, beep
That beep, beep, beep, beep, beep
She goin let me beep, beep, beep, beep, beep
