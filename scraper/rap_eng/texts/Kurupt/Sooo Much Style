[Intro: Kurupt]
Have you ever seen... sooo much style? (Nigga)
Now, uh, we 'bout to do it a little somethin' like this
'Cause it's Dogg Pound on mines, you know what I'm sayin'?
(And you don't stop)
Fuck all you motherfuckers!
(D-P-G-C!)
(And you don't quit)
And umm...for some strange reason
(And you don't stop)
(D-P-G-C!)
Niggas like to duplicate
(And you don't quit)
(And you don't stop)
Transformin' ass side bustas
(And you don't quit)
Daz

[Verse 1: Daz & Kurupt]
Come get at me, and play Get Back
The plots, concoct thoughts adapt, can you counteract?
I open up my eyes, and my thoughts a blank
(But yet and still) There's no idea what these thoughts contain
All alone (Like) like no else around in the area
(Say what?) Runnin' shit from here to Siberia
Now is this a jack move?
Nigga, yes it is
'Cause I'm a Young Gun like Emilio Estevez
You dread it, how you get shredded like paper
Tryna intrude on the caper, who the hell can relate ta THAT!
Automatic straps that's supposed
To be hidden in clothes then exposed
Knows, not, who to step to
This fool selected get his whole jaw connect to
I select too so motherfucker bow down
Niggas swear the Pound got so much style

[Chorus]
So many styles, so many styles, so many styles
So many styles, so many styles, so many styles
(Motherfuckers swear they got so much style)
So many styles, so many styles, so many styles
So many styles, so many styles, so many styles

[Verse 2: Kurupt & Daz]
(Now, have you ever seen?) Seen meaning saw
Niggas running up in me, murdering them all
My composure, stays above sixty degrees
Before I enter in a circle and start marauding MC's
The hysteria starts, multiplied two times
Supplied by the vibes, here's a run wild style
They can't match, in the back of my vocab batch
If you can enter, take the stash, nigga, I'll start from scratch
So enter in my zone, I refuse to be dethroned
I got a microphone I had to kill and murder to own
From the bottom to the top and when you stare in my eyes
Emotionless shit registers in my mind when I get high
The darkest secrets, keep it untold
When it's revealed the Amityville mirage will unfold
Take flight, I ignite like C-dash-4
With Daz I'll blow the shit the fuck up like the last World War
My creations, mental invasions
Thoughts that's able to annihilate generations, with so much style

[Chorus]
So many styles, so many styles, so many styles
So many styles, so many styles, so many styles
So many styles, so many styles, so many styles
(Motherfuckers swear they got so much style)
So many styles, so many styles, so many styles
So many styles, so many styles, so many styles

[Verse 3: Daz]
Now let me take a second, for Dat Nigga Daz
To amaze with the ways to catch, snap bones, let alone
Fuck up the scene, drop bombs upon the microphone
How can you see me when I'm already high and blown?
To the fullest, Kurupt pull the MC's card
Now the Pound is blessed, like God
I'm a Dogg, we gotta get paid, we gotta get paid

[Verse 4: Kurupt]
Every single day our shit is getting played
So conclusively is the conclusion
The art of illusion
Niggas step in the midst of confusion
How can you see what can't be viewed?
DPG has the ability to end a whole feud
So forget it, you're feeling lyrically energetic
So I sentence you to death by use of poetics
This my realm, so don't even try to explore it
Niggas tried and wonder why they lost they whole life for it

[Verse 5: Daz]
Niggas don't realize what's with the Pound
Blueberry smoke clears the town when me and Kurupt puts it down
From the shoulders we be swingin', with the straps, we be jumpin'
No suggestions needed when my Mac-90 start dumpin'
Let me explain something, niggas don't know what time it is
I ain't even trying to make friends
Fuck the bullshit, the idiotic type bullshit
That you be stressin', let me get to the lesson
Peep me out, now you know
'94's the year, now we fuck up hoes
'95, we survive every day
And what they say? We got style

[Outro Chorus]
So many styles, so many styles, so many styles
(We got style)
So many styles, so many styles, so many styles
(We got style)
So many styles, so many styles, so many styles
(Motherfuckers swear they got so much style)
So many styles, so many styles, so many styles
(Kurupt tha Kingpin, shit, he got so much style)
So many styles, so many styles, so many styles
(Snoop Doggy Dogg, motherfuckers say he got so much style)
So many styles, so many styles, so many styles
(Dat Nigga Daz, motherfuckers say he got so much style)
So many styles, so many styles, so many styles
(The Lady of Rage, motherfuckers say that she got so much style)
So many styles, so many styles, so many styles
(Yeah, Death Row, everybody know we got so much style)
