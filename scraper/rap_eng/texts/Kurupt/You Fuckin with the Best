[Intro: Kurupt and Domination]
Yeah! These niggers acting like bitches again
Rack the niggers up! Hey nigga! Get your ass in here, nigga! It's a rack up homie!
Yeah, Kurupt Young Gotti, check this shit out:
Proud to be among you all here today! Domination, banger, what's cracking?
The streets
Yeah, real vicious! Gotti's Adolph Hitler, Gotti's Ben Laden, Neal Paul, Vinnie, Stallone!

[Verse 1: Kurupt]
I never told these bitch ass niggers before
Too close gets too [?] shooting off the stage and show
Shooting off the roof of the club, dumping of the back of a [?]
Shooting through your curtains at home!
Hollow, levitating everything that you posses or you own!
Nigga! I'm more than Kurupt, Young Gotti
I'm the next California governor, you better ask somebody!
I've got a history of body and bodies!
Gotti and Domination came through to start quaking sections
On the sides of mountains, and make streams turn to oceans and waterfalls and fountains
Listen, I'm calling out names,[?] airborne malaria, I'm in this bitch!
I'ma show the whole team, are you in this bitch?
West Coast:

[Chorus: Kurupt, Domination]
You fucking with the best
With the best, nigga!
You run New York, I run the motherfucking West, nigga!
Get your cash on, get your blast on
We're the reason your career doesn't last long!
I came in this motherfucker with a mask on
So lay your ass on the floor, or get blast on!
You fucking with the best
With the best, nigga!
You run New York, I run the motherfucking West, nigga!

[Verse 2;Domination]
I'm from a different world, like the Wang-Wang
Where niggers shoot gang-bangers, sling k and roll dice on the train
In the West we ride trucks in the East's Air forces
Both [?], guns smoking niggers
So be cautious!
These streets corrupted the kid
A lot of murderers is from were I live!
A lot of [?]
These rap dudes act hard until we get on some other shit!
Our gang is vicious, real militant-minded gangsters
Young killers in the middle of violence
Keep back, you know how niggers in the East act
My West Coast niggers [?]
Domination of course
Banging had got them balls, fuck you party, so we're starting a war!
Shotties popping, bodies dropping, until the black the shit off
Police tape, bloodstains, white chalk on the floor!
East Side:

[Chorus: Kurupt, Domination]

[Verse 3: Kurupt]
Pull that nigga out that hoodie he's wearing
And put him back to that hoodie you're wearing
And see if he's gangster, if he's not
He's a victim of the block
Get down, get shot
Quit rapping like Pac
Shoot him up, bang-bang and gang-bang terrorists
[?] toss niggers off the terrorists

[Chorus: Kurupt, Domination]

[Bridge]
I came in this motherfucker with a mask on
So lay your ass on the floor, or get blast on!

[Verse 4: Domination]
I'm this city's nightmare, better watch where your eyes steer
My goons will lay you down right here
You fake shooters couldn't move us off the block
How do six niggers dump and nobody gets shot?
How does one get close and then roll his Glock
Start pumping them boys up till he's certain they're not
Before they move, tell them suckers, get their aim up
How do you miss from two feet? Pussy, step your game up!

[Chorus: Kurupt, Domination]
