[Verse 1]
Hello how ya doin, yea I’m glad you called
Been thinking bout you all day,had your number on the wall
I missed all your messages, your texts that you sent
My old number, baby that thang done wit
See I own no caller ID, didn’t recognize your number
Maybe the area code that made me start to wonder
Whad up, baby boo, yea you see me calling
You know what time it is, that’s when the boys get to balling

[Chorus]
When it gets cold outside and you got nobody to love
You'll understand what I mean when I say
There's no way we're gonna give up
And like a little girl cries in the face of a monster that lives in her dreams
Is there anyone out there 'cause it's getting harder and harder to breathe
Is there anyone out there 'cause it's getting harder and harder to breathe


[Verse 2]
I try to catch my breath, again it feels like it’s no oxygen left
I’m all closed in, every step I’m hesitatin’
I’m delusional, hallucinatin’ like I’m suffocatin’
Strapped to a chair,straitjacket on ma back
It’s horrific I can’t hack it, I’m crackin and walkin backwards
Talkin to maself like the happening, it’s happening
Right here and now I’m trapped again in this accident
I’m trapped in ma own dreamworld here
A dream so obscene, reoccurring nightmare
If I have noone to hold , noone to love, noone to share
You left me in a state a uncontrollable fear
Is it really one out there, cause it’s getting harder and harder to breathe
Does it kill
Does it burn
Is it painful to learn
That it's me that has all the control
Does it thrill
Does it sting
When you feel what I bring
And you wish that you had me to hold

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Is there anyone out there 'cause it's getting harder and harder to breathe
