[Kurupt]
The centrifugal force will change, but I won't change shit
I rearrange shit that aims to bang shit
Live from Philly, live from Los Angeles
Live from the Beach, articulate with the speech
I jumped over the pinnacle with hand grenades
I got a pistol that'll whistle off hand grenades
Extend over land, terrain, sky and water
Don't fuck with us nigga we got lots of guns
I spit words that can decrease your oxygen
Indeed move it like speed, poetical transporter
Fire and brimstone, torture and manslaughter
It seems like the homicides will never stop
In the scenes of the homicide's a clever plot
I angle my position, I strangle my opposition
From danger to odds and dippin' forever rocked

[Chorus: Kurupt]
Nigga, Dogg Pound Gangstas, live and pushin'
Off the kush'n, we don't give a fuck about your pussy
And you niggas, all we wanna do is just smash
Each and every single one of y'all ain't from the squad

[Daz Dillinger]
My new adventure in life - more money, more guns
More niggas, more reputable stripes
Three-time felon, spell it out - when ya read it
Ain't makin' no money nigga so I really don't need it
Resolve with heat in your face, warm ya up when you're cold
I pull it back, POW-POW, let it all explode
Let it do what it suppose', I chose my own destiny
Now you see me in the kitchen cookin' up the recipe
Fingers on the trigger, no nigga ever gettin' the best of me
Dogg Pound legacy, forever yo, let it be
Project so negatively, y'all niggas ain't ready for me
See I'm a gangsta to the fullest, my stamina's G
Increase the pressure, bust back
Slow your roll lil' homie, you movin' too fast
From Kurupt and Dat Nigga Daz, nigga whoopin' that ass

[Chorus: Kurupt]
Nigga, Dogg Pound Gangstas, live and pushin'
Off the kush'n, we don't give a fuck about your pussy
And you niggas, all we wanna do is just smash
Each and every single one of y'all ain't from the squad

[Kurupt]
It's me and the homies, nigga it's on
I'll make the floor shake, I'll hit you with all I got
I'll make sure before it's over I get you with all I got
The homies been bored... so actually
I'ma bring the activity in actually
The first thing we got on our agenda is smashin' the streets
Chippin' the curb, re-open the 'Shaw and do it
Daz, with a never seen before Buick
Shit, you ain't know you could G that up?
Hit the party, D.P.G.C. that up?

[Daz Dillinger]
We blue and grey niggas, they see that such
AK's D-O - D-O double-G's will bust
Spit, hittin', never missin', takin' out my opposition
Givin' it to you niggas the only way I could give it
Make a u-turn, retreat, niggas need some more heat
Too late for marches, we mashin' through the street

[Chorus: Kurupt]
Dogg Pound Gangstas, live and pushin'
Off the kush'n, we don't give a fuck about your pussy
And you niggas, all we wanna do is just smash
Each and every single one of y'all ain't from the squad

[Kurupt]
Move in, move out, tell me what it's all about
Hit the spot, get the money, in and out, nigga now
I'll I'ma do is G it up to a T
Bang on these bustas, D.P.G.C

[Daz talking]
Live and direct, Dogg Pound

K-U-R-U-P-T
Let's go!...
