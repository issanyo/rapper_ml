She the one you thought would never do a solo LP Yeah now what chick could outsell me (what chick) Drama comes in dozens and I know you love it (you love it)  A rose is still a rose so I rose above it (yeah) The more that they see the woman got a mind of her own The less that they want a part of my throne it figures But the more they compare me to the ones they could own They know they never should have left me alone I'm bigga no doubt Money came gave my Jesus up Treat me like David Blaine and freeze me up Let me address the issue I'm super not superficial Spoil me The only statement I'm makin' is royalties (rock the dollars) 7 digits never under my bank account hold Numbers like your phone number plus area code (area code) Gamble with your career Go ahead chance her See what happened with scrubs on my records Deserve answers

I'm bigger than the rest of you cats I'm straight gutter I dabbed now ho Get lost in this motherfucker A man gon' stand on his own feet in due time I recall from my rank I refuse to lose mine Tell 'em we don't want the poor stuff The devil is men And he been hatin' us in many ways over the years Back when we first started sippin' the beers and sniffin' the coke Most of the big timers were the niggas with dope Whenever we went clubbin' rock hard it was grown Niggas sold CD's out their trunk get anyone what you want  Believe they had that idea was lookin' for fun My people kept a connect on the pieces and punk See it ain't about bein' judged I care about sex It's 'bout knowin' when to talk And who you gon' fuck with Also knowin' what it means to be a frontline soldier Because in one blink of an eye it's over
