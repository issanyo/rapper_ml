[Intro: Snoop Dogg]
DPGC, ah-ha
D-A-Z, and the Bigg D-O-double G
Little something for the ladies
Let me sing to 'em one time, nephew
Yeah, check this out...

[Chorus: Snoop Dogg]
When I put this thing on you, there ain't nothin' you can do
'Cept pull your drawers down (they got to)
Pull ya drawz down (you got to)
When I put this thing on you, there ain't nothin' you can do
'Cept pull your drawers down (you got to)
Pull ya drawz down (you got to)
(What up, Dogg?)

[Verse 1: Snoop Dogg]
I just left the weight room, ya boy tryna get bigger
It's Friday night, it's just me and my nigga
We on the hunt, on the scout, tryna turn a bitch out
And when we get 'em, dig how we did 'em
We treat 'em like stars
VIP, free drinks at the bar
Just tell 'em you're with the entourage
The big boss Doggy Dogg in charge
Everything's exquisite
Big things we, did it, now let me get it
Matter of fact, let me hit it
You know Wednesdays is friends days, you cool wit' it?
And Thursdays is her day
And Friday is my day, to fly away
And ain't no flyer away
So tip tip with a nigga like right away

[Chorus: Snoop Dogg]
When I put this thing on you, there ain't nothin' you can do
'Cept pull your drawers down (they got to)
Pull ya drawz down (you got to)
When I put this thing on you, there ain't nothin' you can do
'Cept pull your drawers down (you got to)
Pull ya drawz down (you got to)

[Verse 2: Daz]
When I whip this thing out on you
You pull 'em up, I pull 'em down, now it's all on you
Baby blew with no clue, now she throwin' a hint
We gettin' bent and gettin' blown, now the Pound, yeah, the shit
Like hide and go get it, and I'm looking to get it
She wears skin tight panties and it's properly fitted
I wanna do something sneaky with you
A menage-a-trois, I'm getting freaky with you
Smack her once, smack her twice, boy, you're nothing nice
Her heady hit the beddy now turn off the lights
I Pendergrass'd her and ask her "How did you like it?"
She said "Diggy Daz, you're the one that I'm liking"
I drop it like it's H-O-T 'cause it's nothing to do it
And this is how you do it
So won't you blaze up the weed with me and my cousin
With a little more wet, we finna have the club buzzin'

[Chorus: Snoop Dogg]
When I put this thing on you, there ain't nothin' you can do
'Cept pull your drawers down (they got to)
Pull ya drawz down (you got to)
When I put this thing on you, there ain't nothin' you can do
'Cept pull your drawers down (you got to)
Pull ya drawz down (you got to)

[Verse 3: Kurupt]
Just went to the store, switches and some more Coronas
I gotta keep it cool by the pool
'Cause the ladies got on nothing but bikinis
Tryna get a nigga to come over and just (show 'em what I'm workin' with)
I'll take three, you three and me
We gon' smoke, we gon' drank, have you ever seen dank this green?
This red? Take it to the head, gimme some head
This orange, this purple
This the type of shit that might hurt you
Baby, just slide, get on top
Twerk it like a pole, up and down, hop
Show me whatcha got, show your friend too
Better show your other friend exactly what to do
But I already knew, you already knew
This ain't shit new, show Snoop and Daz too

[Chorus: Snoop Dogg]
When I put this thing on you, there ain't nothin' you can do
'Cept pull your drawers down (they got to)
Pull ya drawz down (you got to)
When I put this thing on you, there ain't nothin' you can do
'Cept pull your drawers down (you got to)
Pull ya drawz down (you got to)
