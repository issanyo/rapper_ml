Throughout the cold nights we be cashin in
Makin dollars, makin shit pop around here
Fiends, niggas and cops and gangbangers rule my block
My everyday life is crime, a 9-to-5 of slangin rocks
9 millimetres, .3-80's, AK's and Glocks
Clockin major knots, I sit back and I watch it clock
Watchin in anybody and any, wit every fuckin dime, every penny
What a pity how we live in the city
Livin greedy, livin selfish, rebellious witta spirit that is jealous
Developed the knack to kill and slang crack, huh
Smokin buddha's at a bomb orange buddha
Stabbin motherfuckers in the back in if they do ya
Roll wit niggas that's the same, roll around witta gang
Rollin to school my bang, bang, hang out
I'm sellin dope to strung-out fiends who always kept green
What's the American Dream? Makin makin money
Keepin pistols and shit, 'cause ain't a damn thing funny
Niggas around my block be actin so crummy
Wit a little doe I maintain G's, status just to have it
Anything that I see it was my job just to have it
Sweepin down and sellin, where my homeboys live
Scoop 6-400, of that bomb smoked ass real
High, I can see the homeys pass by
We creep inside, lettin niggas know this Eastside

Now all my motherfuckin niggas they - ROLL WIT' US
And all my No Limit soldiers they - ROLL WIT' US
And all my Westside Connection niggas yo they - ROLL WIT' US
And all my Dogg Pound, niggas they - ROLL WIT' US
And all my niggas from Death Row - ROLL WIT' US
And all my Outlaw niggas they - ROLL WIT' US
And everybody round the neighbourhood - ROLL WIT' US
Say they ROLL WIT' US, I said they ROLL WIT' US

In the city it was about wreck
Where I stay the 'fluence is pursuin the life of a G
Totin weapons was my profession, my moms catch me
She beat me but it ain't teachin me no lessons of survivin
Diamonds investin, cars that's impressive
I'm slangin now, major 'caine now
Quarter P's and half pounds and whole pounds, ugh
All my life all I heard was gun sound
Age 13 I joined a major gang in Sittown
I got the hood tatted for life, anybody cross me
I will pay dearly from gun blastin, blood on the knife
To be a motherfuckin gangsta was all I wanted
Daz Dillinger out to make out wit a million dollars
Shot caught him plus ballin, I'm 17
In the hood, straight love me from them Gz to them fiends, huh
Small timin to big ballin
I moved up from some small shit to packin full clips
And everybody knew me all around the town
I'm layin punk motherfuckers down

Now all my niggas in Texas they - ROLL WIT' US
And all my niggas from Oklahoma they - ROLL WIT' US
All my niggas from Louisiana - ROLL WIT' US
And all my Bay Area niggas yo they - ROLL WIT' US
All my niggas in Chicago they - ROLL WIT' US
All my niggas in Seattle yo they - ROLL WIT' US
Everybody round the neighbourhood - ROLL WIT' US
Say they ROLL WIT' US, say they ROLL WIT' US

Get out the way if you ain't about paper, bustin on player haters
Who think they can fade us, that's how the streets made us
Invincible, leavin the whole scene critical
Takin over your shit man that's the main principle
Here we go, here we are, niggas roll around in fancy cars
Fuckin rap stars, sellin weed and caviar
You think ya wasn't serious til y'all got blasted
Rollin wit them sucker ducks'll leave you in a casket
It's drastic to suicide, how we ride?
Jump out on yo ass within the blink of an eye
Cash money got me addicted, til worry niggas kick it
Good shit from bad shit, that's how we get Pacific
The G is for give me, the A is for anybody killin in this
For the niggas plus the G's we be gettin

All my motherfuckin niggas they - ROLL WIT' US
All my niggas from Long Beach - ROLL WIT' US
All my niggas from Compton - ROLL WIT' US
All my niggas from Pasadena they - ROLL WIT' US
