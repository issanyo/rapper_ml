[Verse 1:]
First thing I’m gonna do is aim
Hit him dead in his chest
Rumble his body up to his chain
Cause am the best west kept secret
D nickle nine already cocked
Nigga i run the block
The homies come through in flocks
You can see the body drop yea
I’m just a rider mayne
Coming through you can see we the riders mayne
Dogg pound rider game
Young Osama game
I'm suspicious of these funny bitches
Bouncing on dem bomb switches
The world collapsed and all i'm left with is just me and my mac
The back of the game in front of my face
The more i aim is the more i brace (i’m going down)
It’s just too much am thinking bout more than enough
Poverty stricken, obviously trippin
Lookin to the world as a monopoly locked in a prison
Poetry is rich all you gotta do is grab a branch a d tree
Dis all frustrated silence symphony is synchronized
Subliminal sirens from beneath
Floatin in a ocean of fire and water tryna reach a piece of the barrier reef
Endin up stuck in the barrier’s teeth but i know i could be replaced like a pair of your teeth
The temporary occasions of war and braisins
Just  help me  embrace it get ready to face it
Let’s face it you playin yo aces
The only chances i’ve got is to leave ya’ll faceless
Faceless means a nigga got paces so imma have to take away divide and erase this
The memory will have no traces from every side left, right, up and adjacent

[Chorus 1:]
(Cause) once i had a girl that was just playing triflin
Can't believe i wanted to wife her but i liked her
Once i had a homie so foul that i end up
Havin to knock the home bwoy out (knock him out)
Once a nigga tried to lay me down i ain't seen that nigga since i’m lookin for him now
(I’m lookin for him now)

[Chorus 2:]
I’m lookin for him now(x3)
Yea nigga yea nigga yea
(I’m lookin for him now)


[Verse 2:]
If you look at me too hard i might have to kill ya
Disect ya crease might have to pill yah
Skin ya, can ya, package up, seal ya, reveal ya
Put a little bitch that you are you need a little practice my sensational tactics
You just a coward nigga you lucky i ain't active
I'm feelin like smashin  in a  building liposuc Kurupt is up in d building
Im the poetry editor i'm writing hood neighbourhood predator
Ya’ll know i'm from the war zone nigga gettin paper hater we’ll talk about it later
I sell this to the hoes by d packs serve it like mothafucking quartersacks
Anytime, any place, anywhere, get spread like Nair
Nigga shave like hair
Contrary to popular beliefs there ain’t no stoppin
I got rhymes that get you higher than oxycottons
With remarkable words, I’m a Spartan mothfucka Leonidas the third (third)
Once dis nigga socked me in d mouth
Put me down an back up I’m lookin for him now

[Chorus 1]
Once i had a girl that was just playing triflin
Can't believe i wanted to wife her but i liked her
Once i had a homie so foul that I end up havin to knock the home boy out (knock him out)
Once a nigga tried to lay me down i ain't seen that nigga since i’m lookin for him now
(I’m lookin for him now)

[Chorus 2:]
I’m lookin for him now(x3)
Nigga
(I’m lookin for him now)
Now!
