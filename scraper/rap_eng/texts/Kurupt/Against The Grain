Im fresh off the block you can still see the streets sign

My music is underrated my niggas think I’m the greatest
My brother think imma make it, but I already made it the game is wishy washy
Niggas is overrated the radio disc jockeys they love us but they don't play us
What happened to unity my community doing bad
Is nothing you can do to me they ain't did to me in the past
Im telling my block tales going against the grain and I'll be damned if I make a song just to
Fit the game
What happened in real life I turned down deals twice lived on a hill twice
But I can't leave this block life this is real life situations this is us at our best
This is the reason you all been waiting why you've been hating
You could’ve been patient you ain't ready to face this war you're creating
This pentagon nigga you send a bomb nigga you soft in the middle
Your aims all off with the pistol I’ll make ya murder a mystery murder ya ham
Broke a couple of niggas that a kill ya for two grand you coward you pussy
Pop you scared your games all backwards you lack the heart
I broke his jaw they couldn't put it back the part
You a punk in a LA hat you ain't hard you better pay attention to who you tellin you are
My niggas is raw we all itchin for reason to spaz out rack at the homies rack at the
Gauges a spaz out nigga nigga hey nigga
And if you ever ever see me in the all black beanie you don't
Wanna fuck with me
I got the homies on the side and they all ready ridin you don’t wanna fuck with me
I got my Pentagon riders all in the house entourage riders all in the house
S.M.A nigga we all in the house, Death Row fool all in the house
The house the house the house
