Kurupt: Uh, PG

Verse 1: Peter Gunz

I walk holding my balls about an inch from the wall
Keep bitches hypnotized as if my name was biggie smalls
Your girl's a dime dipper, nigga keep her head locked
Trust Gunz with your wife? Motherfucker bet not
Sleep on Peter G, please don't ever doubt it
From here to New Orleans, I'll improve da bout it bout it
When a days I do a Michael, to the days of being jailed
Clash with thoughts that kept my fresh mind stale

Bridge: Peter Gunz and Kurupt

Now, who you know, with a New York flow
That keeps a grower respect from California like I'm
Snoop Doggy Dogg?

Peter Gunz:

Well, I'm Pete gunny Gunz
For plenty ammo ammo
Shove this pipe in yo wife
And watch her voice hit soprano
I got rhymes, cock mine
Just shits naughty gimmick
That nigga that raps about it
But he do it in a minute
Got schemes that'll break yo wealth
Break yo health
You see me comin nigga
Just break yourself, (break yourself)
A bronx tails like deniro
The girl call me, "hero"
Bust a kids' in the mouth in a 15-0-0
Playas play on
Hatas hate on
Put my weight on
Hit yo bitch off
And then I skate on
Lay on, me
Niggas can't touch this
Try to rush this? (shit)
Fuck this
Get the fuck out of here, (you know what I'm sayin?)

Chorus: Kurupt
This is for my niggas holdin' down the street
Sellin' drums hand to hand under massive heat
Cause a nigga got to do what he gots to do
So if you that type of nigga, then this shit's for you
All my gun slingin' niggas from L.A. to New York
Who ain't havin' it, let the pistols spray then we talk
Cause a nigga got to do what he gots to do
So if you that type of nigga then this shit's for you

Verse 2: Sticky Fingaz
This is the facsimile
You bout to get that ass faxed
This is simple
And beat with bast
I got a little somethin somethin
For all you cats
And all you fleas
And all you Cs, (all y'all)
Midnight dark
Cock back the spark
It starts sparkin
And everything's dark
And I know where them niggas is at
There they go
Gettin hit like, "Where the homies at?
Where they go?"
Yeah nigga
Left all alone in the zone
Where heads are flown back
Bone flown in the zone
Terrors, dripemental
Tight and gigantic
Titanium, Subterrainium
Titanic, it's all loose
Vanish and run 'em down, (what?)
Peter Gun and the down
Full pound, full round
Tariq stack the pockets of his pants
Rob a fringah, (what?)
That's what you get
For fucking with niggas with
Sticky Fingaz, (yeah, yeah)
I though about it
And naw, I don't doubt it
Might get us
But don't fuck with us

Verse 3: Peter Gunz:
Gunz (7x)
Movin and groovin
And showin (fade)
Ay yo I blast in the door
Everybody get the fuck down
Anybody move is gettin fucked down
Kurupt pull the truck round
Blindfolded gag these niggas
Grab these niggas
They move bodybag these niggas
That's when they start bitchin
Like, "he said it, and he said it"
What the funny shit about it (yo)
They both gettin get it
Do you head it?
It's a lot fish
You might see the Titanic
In this gigantic
But you're dead nigga in
Five minutes

Verse 4: Lord Tariq
Ay yo Gunz,I bust him in the mouth
Give him new meaning to
"Bite the bullet"
If he flips, I won't think
I react just pull it
Got to take 22 full clips
Cock it back to you
Next silly you
I'm killin you
You gettin blessed by the L-O
Say hello to my big partner
Yo with this heavy metal
I'm a rock ya
I tell yo fuckin block, bring your guns
Ya bring your goons
And I'm killin all 9 of y'all motherfuckers

Chorus

Lord Tariq:
Ay yo I see 9 niggas
I got 9 shots, I gots to stay low
Niggas know me from
Robbin spots
Better be get my rec on
Got my vest on
My shit is reinforced
Stick enough to stop Teflon
They got about a key
In the corner
They sittin in a 3
In a quarter
On the way of the manslaughter
So I approach the man
The keys to the car, cash and the coke
Get the fuck on the floor
Or get smoked motherfucker
Starin at the trees on my trucker
Jumped in the 3, I hit a bruptner
I must've been doing about 80
Some niggas gave chasin a Mercedes
I'm laughin, (haha)
Cocked my nine, and start blastin
Six to the chest
For being swift with the tongue
Now you use a garbage bag
For a lung
You can't fuck with a gun
I've been in this game since '81
Lord Tariq and Peter Gunz y'all done
