[Chorus:]
Here’s what they think about you [x3]

[Verse 1:]
Rappers an artistes, tell em to shut it up
Cause I’ll fuck err last one a them up, especially Kurupt
See that’s ma lil homeboy so we know what’s up
He betta keep krippin, his slip is clippin
Cause dese niggas trippin, this is official business

[Chorus:]
Here’s what they think about you (mental)

[Verse 2:]

We go give it up in d worst way, an we gon’ shoot you niggas up cause it’s yo birthday

[Chorus]

[Verse 3:]
Mothafucka, I’m a Death Row killa, Suge Knight can die

[Verse 4:]
Kurupt ain’t shit, Suge Knight you bitch ass nigga you ain’t shit
An all you mothafuckaz around d world (you ain’t shit)

[Chorus]

[Outro:]
This is what happens when you talk
An you gon’ die if I get you bitch, so jus watch it
6 banana clips, each wid 50 rockets
Niggas don’t got no whips, niggas got empty pockets
Niggas can’t handle this, you bitches jus need to watch it
It’s a rap cause nigga you can’t rap
So get it strapped an pack it, get yo sack an wrap it
Kurupt ain’t shit, Suge Knight you bitch ass nigga you ain’t shit
Die nigga (die nigga)
Oh yea, it ain’t ova mothafuckaz
