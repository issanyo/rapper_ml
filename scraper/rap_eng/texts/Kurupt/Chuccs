[Chorus]
Copped the new pair x4
Yo I got some chuccs
Copped the new pair
Yo I got some chuccs
Copped the new pair
Yo I got some chuccs x7
Copped the new pair

[Verse 1:Kurupt]
Now suede and leather no not me
Original blue off white white T
Timberlands are cool but it don't snow here
I got some rare pair of chucks you can't find no where
So calm explosive moppin up the block
Swap meet edition crisp and you knew it off top
That gots to be a gangsta he's pushing too hard got that G boy stance and I’m crispy all stars cannabis medical shop doc stop do
Cop tha kush bush the bundles in the chuccs they got two you can't find a spot in LA that don't serve these and if you trip I cock and pop and serve these hollow heaven, rain like mothballs the homies serving cocaine rocks the size of golf balls and when they get they chips what do they
Go get they don't get jordans to match their khaki outfit

[Chorus]

You know how I start with the chuck taylor classics limited edition with the custom made fabric
Fitted hat on GQ with the glasses
You could tell us cuz the G’D up status homie got the fat laces and they tongue downs and they footsteps pound similar to the drum sound when I come around I never dress sloppy don’t confuse my confidence for cockiness
Ball like stylistic jones ball like I’m Dr. Jay  mingle with a attitude but I'm not Dr. Dre you know who we are when we hit your turf say its the all star then kiss the converse

[Chorus]

[Outro]
