[Intro: Dr. Dre]
That's right
Some of that shit you just can't fuck with
Tha Dogg Pound flava, for the nine-fever
Know what I'm sayin'? Michel'le in the house
That's right, set it off

[Verse 1: Dat Nigga Daz, Michel'le]
Young Daz struck a match and the match went out
But it wasn't no more lights in the house, check it out
Speakin' of house let's play a game of it
Are ya wit it? Hide and go get it, I betcha love it baby
I'll play the daddy and you can play the mama
So we can get down upon the living room floor
Are ya wit it? I promise I won't kill it
Puddy-cat on the loose, what should I do, should I kill it?
Yeah

[Pre-Chorus: Michel'le]
See back in the day when we used to play
You wanted to be with me [that's right]
Now that is so right and natural
No other man that I can see
I'm singin in my background
Diggin up a hole for you to make your move
But no longer will I feed your ego
Let's play house

[Hook: Daz, (Michel'le), Nate Dogg]
Engine engine number nine [Let's play house]
Rollin down the DP line (Let's play house)
Engine engine number nine [Let's play house]
Rollin down the DP line
(Isn't that what you want me to do with you?)
You play the mama then [Let's play house]
I'll play the daddy
You can play the mama and I'll play the daddy
(Let's play house)
You can play the mama and [Let's play house]
I'll be the daddy
And I'll be the daddy that runs the house, straight up

[Verse 2: Dat Nigga Daz, Kurupt]
I'm in the shack bout to blaze up a sack
Yeah we grown all alone posted up the back
There's no mistakin, I can have the whole house shakin
Young Daz in that ass baby doll no fakin
Don't get me wrong, tell me what's the flavor of the song
You know it's Daz in your drawers when ya mama ain't home
Ring the alarm, I got ya buzz, lovin me
Physically and mentally, I knew that it was never meant to be

I know you know this girl by the name of Danielle
Body of a Goddess face from hell
But oh shhh, this wasn't the average trick
(She got the bomb) and she like gobblin and swallowin
A whole nine and a half on dat black ass
Groupie now all the hoochies wanna do me from the past
To the present (say what?) let me rep and present
(Who dat?) The biggest nigga hittin all the hoes in your click
Fast as lightning, runnin through like the breeze
In the summertime out on the corners making G's
It's the thirst, but I can show somethin much worse
Than the thirst, if worse came to worse, but first things first
Brenda, I can remember
How hot y'all be gettin, eighty-seven, eighty-six, and, yeah
The year a young man grows
Some women become ladies, some turn into hoes
Young hoes grown, find a way to stay wit me
In the cut wit Kurupt, come and play with me, yeah

[Outro: Michel'le, Nate Dogg]
If ya wanna be wit me, stay wit me, play wit me
Come correct when you step to me
My, sweet, baby
If ya wanna be wit me, stay wit me, play wit me (Let's Play House)
Come correct when you step to me (Let's Play House)
My, sweet, baby (Let's Play House)
Let's play house, let's play house, let's play house
Let's play house, let's play house
