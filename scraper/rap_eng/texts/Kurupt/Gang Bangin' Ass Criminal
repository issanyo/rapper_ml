[Daz Dillinger]
Yeah, Daz Dillinger
I'm gonna take you into some gangsta shit

And now you fans to know about
What we call Gangsta Rap
But this is for the niggas who was down from day one

Love to hear, love to hear you motherfuckers
I advise all you ghetto livin', struggling from day to day
Tryin' to flip a figure dollar devil up inside a bag of weed
A fresh pair of khakis and take a bitch to the movie ass niggas
To get your money man, get paid
These motherfuckers are cut off welfare
How are we go eat if we don't cheat
These (?) bitch to me made the game out of young black niggas lives
Striking us out from left to right
With no motherfucking one in sight
Fuck that!!
Sell your dope
Get your jack on, get your sack on
Put your rag on and get your motherfucking thang on, niggas
Cause it's on
God dammit it's on

[BA] Man I'm trying to have
Man I ain't trying to go for shit
[DD] Man you know my Glock is hot
(Eastside)

Verse One: [Kurupt Tha Kingpin]
I'm coming through your zone late night, shit
Dogg Pound Gangsta to flame the light shit
Cause I hold on
I'm 20 feet tall
The biggest wall built fuck around and get killed
Get shoot
Don't try to sneak a peak in my book
Comatose overdose the thoughts when he look
The forbidden
The hittin' zone that I'm hitting
Don't play with my intelligence nigga as the heat (?slittin'?)
(?)
So I only got two choicesloc; either blast or bomb
Vietnam
I bring the pain rains no sleet or hail
Execution style is the shells from the heat fell
Down to the ground like the rest of the dummies
That's what the fuck you get for tryna' try to play with my money
It's nothing but the Dogg Pound Gangstas
Mashes, verbal disasters, 38 stashes

Verse Two: [Tray Deee]
I arise in disguise to surprise that ass
What you thought you caught me short
I'mma' ride and blast
With the cannon
We let the shit all up in your nuts
When niggas droppin', they stop with the plan they plots
Got to stop for my gate
With (?) of break
Marked niggas caught in, they try to win and get sprayed
Rip the gates
Go flip the page to chapter three
First rule, dead fools can't come after me
I mash to free
Styles of catastrophe
Ask for G
A nigga best to answer me
My rep long as the beach that I represent
Dead nigga with my stare not to step to this

Verse Three: [Daz Dillinger]
Now o yeah Tray Deee
I mean I see the whole plot
Be on alert, niggas shot
Anywhere under that nigga caught
So drop the microphone on my own
I shown to blown
Away for these MC's with the sludge of a chrome
I take the fame
Down on my own lyrical name
When the seas are changed
When the storms and hurricanes
Wide strand
Spittin' rhymes, the beats so precise
(?)
Skatin' on mics like ice
Twice in the day
I get drunk
(?) of plastic bags
Sack in the truck
Because the rhyme as claim
I shit buck like the doctor
Coming through
Bouncin' with the droptop
Like gangstas chillin on the block
Nah, we ain't worry for shit
Got escape doors like Capone
Whit chick your dick on my clip
Forty-fives and nines
Three-eighties and automatics
Slithering, coming through for you
And your boys with some static
I got to have it lovin' thrill of the drama
Enthusing me to gets my norm with the slaughter
I ought to be known as Daz Dillinger
For the shit that I'm known for
A Dogg Pound criminal

Verse Four: [Soopafly]
Now if the spot's hot
I hit the switch make the top drop
Don't stop
It's Soopafly with the sho shot
Won't stop
I got ya whole shit took
Look and listen
I rendition the rhymes with precision
You can't face
Amaze me a place like a saddle
It's Dogg Pound Ganstas (?) like a shadow
I never met a motherfucker who can make you stick
I never met a motherfucker who can feel my clique
You serve, you'll make the twitch like a nerve
You'll try to step to my wild style superb
Adjectives and verbs
Action pack with the words
I'll make it stop
The jaws drop and observe
I sold the block for Crook, Daz, Style and Tray Deee
We be coming with the shit
That be the bomb baby
And ain't a Dogg Pound Gangsta won't knock you to the floor
Either you stupid as fuck or just don't know

Verse Five: [Bad A$$]
Now I know you, know you
Stupid as fuck
Cock, bust like a sawed off punk
Double barrel on 'em
Black gambinos at casinos
Get De Niro on 'em
If I want 'em
I go get 'em
If I gotta shot a nine
Twice, that's what I rhyme like
My clip ain't empty
Do try to test the ridah
Tempt me simply
Bust, hot lead inside ya
Find ya
Fear them, frightened for your life
With your last few
Live with hot live from gunblast
Outlaws, outcast
Low life, south last
Long Beach niggas blast
Yeah the b-side is right
The most, the coast
The west, the best
We damn bitches
Sippin', hittin' switches
Dippin' hittin' robbin' niggas
Itchy fingers on triggers
Itty, bitty niggas
Ready for war
We kick down your door
Draw eatin'
Lay everybody down on the floor

Verse Six: [Technique]
The same thing, different place
With snakes, cowards and strong-arm
Robbery cases, niggas faces
On paperchase
It was seen, it was written
It ain't forbidden
For homies tookok be splittin'
Disagree, no one was hitten
Known with the curls
The many obstacles
Impressions to the feet from gettin' served
Growing up is rough
Your name
Here's the streets it gets tough
You can be scuffed and stuffed
Then I guess you had enough
Over (?)
It ain't coincidental that I be distorted
In my mental
My eyes is for seein', so I watch
Bodies and plots
Win the plots
Call the shots for your nuts
Nigga grips
That's why I (?) my dippin' progress
Cause why is all we tryin' to defeat the progress
I just ain't the one mystic to hit
Young Jonesy sees
Who I got a mission to hit
And constantly flips scripts
Outta wall with balls fast talkin'
And quick draws
How the problem is solved
I want it all (I want it all)
But it's movin' to slow
I'm out to blow
I don't know which way to go
Was on the right path
I thought
Without doin' a dirty word about getting caught
("getting caught" echoes)
