[Verse 1: King Tha Rapper]
New chick, old news, solo with my own moves Thought I could stand on my own two
They say love is priceless but I don't really know
If I gave her 20 Million dollars would She Stay Or Go
It's messed up she don't care heart cold as snow
And I wonder if she even thinking about us growing old
I'm mad as hell and we arguing, we screamin' and we hollerin' she throwing plates and I'm dodgin' I walk out and she calling him
It's Kinda Messed Up But Now that I Think Back I Think That She Was Only With Me For The Cash And Now That Times Past I'm Focused On The Future Ain't Worried Bout The Past. West Coast

[Hook: Junel]

You Used To Have A Good Man, Now You Lost One
I Know That Ain't Part Of The Plan But It's Been Done
Now I'm Rolling With A Bad Bad And I Know It Got You Mad
It's Kinda Sad. Now I'm So Free Got A Beauties All On Me And I
Keep It So G. You Do You While The Ladies Do Me. Agreed?
I.M.O

[Verse 2: Kurupt]

Is That Right, Let Me Show You What I Really Like. Green Eyes
Pretty Hair And Thick Thighs. Beautiful Face With A Itty Bitty Waist
Nephew Dont Lose Ya Mind, And Waste Too Much Time On
Something You'll Find. See All I Can Do Is Just Tell You This Game
Post Up Playboy And Stay In Your Lane, Cause You And The Rest Of Em' Just Ain't The Same. Your A King And They Ain't The Same And You A Young King In Search Of A Queen And When You Get Older You Know What I Mean....You Know What I Mean

[Hook: Junel]

[Bridge: King Tha Rapper]
It's Kinda Crazy Cause I Am What You Made Me Today Till Realized You Were Focused On What I Got Paid
That's Why I Made This Song And Called It I.M.O. In My Opinion girl You Couldn't Be My Sidechick Tho. On The Real
Should've Ended On A Finer Note.  Ain't Tryna Have No Drama While I'm The Bro. I'm  Climbing Up The Charts And Into Ladies Hearts You Could Have Came With Me But I Had To Leave You At The Start West Coast
