[Chorus: Daz]
It feels good to be a muthafuckin' gangsta (for life, for life)
It feels good to be a Dogg Pound Gangsta (for life, for life)
It feels good to be a muthafuckin' gangsta
The D-O-double G the P-O-U-N-D (for life, for life)
It feels good to be a Dogg Pound Gangsta (for life, for life)
It feels good to be a muthafuckin' gangsta (for life, for life)
It feels good to be a Dogg Pound Gangsta
The D-O-double G the P-O-U-N-D

[Verse 1: Kurupt]
Hit me, nigga, cut throat, nigga
We ride and croak niggas, soak niggas
Roil and broke, indica smoke niggas
Get lifted high like glass and coke, nigga
I'm Gotti, I don't fuck with no hooks
I make pelicans fly, I make the AR fifth cook
This The Shining, nigga, honey I'm home
I came with two friends: nine and chrome
Nigga, it's just like this, I'll break your wrist
Push shit through your hip that'll twist and dent
Chipped and splint and then go back where I went
Wanna know where I went? Nigga, follow the fifth
The only two buddies I need: the hollow and fifth
I'll have you swallow the hollow and lift
Fall quickly after the chippin'
All that's left is tremblin' and ligament restrictin', nigga, ride...

[Chorus: Daz]
It feels good to be a muthafuckin' gangsta (for life, for life)
It feels good to be a Dogg Pound Gangsta (for life, for life)
It feels good to be a muthafuckin' gangsta
The D-O-double G the P-O-U-N-D (for life, for life)
It feels good to be a Dogg Pound Gangsta (for life, for life)
It feels good to be a muthafuckin' gangsta (for life, for life)
It feels good to be a Dogg Pound Gangsta
The D-O-double G the P-O-U-N-D

[Verse 2: Daz Dillinger]
I come back with that AK fully automatic, lettin' niggas have it
So who the fuck want static? It's spazmatic
Catchin' their breath, they couldn't panic
Surrounded by choppers and G niggas with big cannons
Peel them niggas like bananas in an all blue bandanna
(Dumpin' with K's, going bananas with bananas in the hammers then we...)
Down the block, rims spinnin' but my beat still knock
Nigga, Daz don't stop
My heat stay cocked and ready
My vendetta's 9 Beretta putting blood holes in your sweater
In due time I can only game, see, I won't fall off
I bounce back like hard or soft, your whole crew get tossed
You lost the feud, left critically injured
Next time y'all fake niggas'll remember
Dat Nigga Daz is a G 'bout this
We fuck shit up and now we out this bitch

[Chorus: Daz]
It feels good to be a muthafuckin' gangsta (for life, for life)
It feels good to be a Dogg Pound Gangsta (for life, for life)
It feels good to be a muthafuckin' gangsta
The D-O-double G the P-O-U-N-D (for life, for life)
It feels good to be a Dogg Pound Gangsta (for life, for life)
It feels good to be a muthafuckin' gangsta (for life, for life)
It feels good to be a Dogg Pound Gangsta
The D-O-double G the P-O-U-N-D

The D-O-double G the P-O-U-N-D...
