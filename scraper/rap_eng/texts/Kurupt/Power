(Intro)
Gotta get this motherfuckin money my nigga
You know?
I’m fall up
Buildin on built buildings my nigga
Getting that big money, ya dig?
Always hustling
Keepin my A game to the hustle gang, you dig?
Countin that money
1… 2… 3… 4
5… 6… 7… 8
9… high… crime… uh
High… 9… times
Lay that nigga down, he can’t move no mo
No 2, no full no
When he gon make it after 2 or 4
3, 4 and 4 mo
(Bridge)
I remember one thing I learned when I was at the coffee shop
Getting my crème like it wasn’t no thing, just doing what the fuck, where you from?
(Hook)
Me and my team and you know my team
Just doin what the fuck we want
But you livin out same, nah I live with the same like what the fuck is wrong?
Money, Bitches, Power
Bricks, money, power
Happenin every hour
Bitches, money, power
Power… power power
Power… power power
Power… power power
(money money, bitches) Power… power power
Money, Bitches, Power
(Verse)
My situation’s so terminal, I’m just ready to fall
And dust myself back off nigga, go get the money and ball
Live my life to the fullest
Been dodging bullest, reflectin
But guiding the lightning I shine
And yet they hardly suspect him
Got a bite like a pick
They say who is in your grizzy?
Your mind all gee in this industry with the locals and semis
As I came, I spray
All the way like the Yankees
Until a nigga like me come up and shoot up the babies
See I remember
(Hook)
Me and my team and you know my team
Just doin what the fuck we want
But you livin out same, nah I live with the same like what the fuck is wrong?
Money, Bitches, Power
Bricks, money, power
Happenin every hour
Bitches, money, power
Power power… power power
Money, Bitches, Power
Power… power power
Get that money every hour
Power… (money) power power (ritches bitches and winnin)
Power power… power power
Bitches ain’t shit, we love you niggas
Cuz I’mma shine regardless baby
You understand me man?
Old is the new new
It feels good being me man
I’m seasonal, I’m a vet
Huh, I’m still getting that money, money
