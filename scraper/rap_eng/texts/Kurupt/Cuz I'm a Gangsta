[Chorus: Daz Dillinger]
I smoke blunts, drink 'gnac
Bust caps at bitch niggas ’cause it's nothin' to me
Cuz I’m a gangsta
I gangbang, brains hangin', dope slangin'
That's the part of life of being a G
Cuz I'm a gangsta
Robbing banks, police shootouts, high speeds
And you know it ain't shit to me
Cuz I'm a gangsta
Blowin' dope up, like my 5, like my 10
It ain’t shit, it ain’t nothing but G
Cuz I'm a gangsta

[Verse 1: Kurupt]
Growing and gaining, posting and banging
Holsters and chambers, toasters and laser beam operated cannons
To keep everything outside outside
The homies dumpin’ 'round the outside
Me and Daz is on a mission, tell me what you think
Fuck the world, nigga, we raiding federal banks
It's the only way to get some fuckin' money nowadays
Off of 5, off of 10, off of 20 nowadays
Off of 9, get me 9, get the 9, nina pop
Fuck around and get your femur chipped, stop, open up
Open or get your muthafuckin’ whole front opened up
From your muthafuckin' navel to your muthafuckin' hairline
Separated your sections, look up, open lungs
Since the days of shooting muskets, I'd have been bustin'
Looking at the law in their eyes like 'fuck it, it's nothin''
Face to face, shooting and dumpin', dippin' and duckin'
You see I...

[Chorus: Daz Dillinger]
I smoke blunts, drink 'gnac
Bust caps at bitch niggas 'cause it's nothin' to me
Cuz I'm a gangsta
I gangbang, brains hangin', dope slangin'
That's the part of life of being a G
Cuz I'm a gangsta
Robbing banks, police shootouts, high speeds
And you know it ain't shit to me
Cuz I'm a gangsta
Blowin' dope up, like my 5, like my 10
It ain't shit, it ain't nothing but G
Cuz I'm a gangsta

[Verse 2: Daz Dillinger]
A quarter ki and two pounds with the 50 rounds
We spray you from ceiling, spray you down to the ground
I'm vicious, my nigga, you know I have no feelings
Check out the news for the next notorious Dogg Pound killing
I'm mill'd out, I'm thugged out
Murder, grippin' pistols from niggas who fresh out
I'm loc'ed up, I'm loc'ed up
Ready for our provokers, niggas gotta die for it
I put it down from the barrel, niggas' path is narrow
My aim sharp as an arrow, muthafucka, I dare ya
Step up, feel the wrath of Al-Qaeda
Dat Nigga Daz, Kurupt Young Gotti, them Dogg Pound riders
We on fire, torch y'all niggas to death
Fuck what you talking 'bout, we the last niggas left
Original Crip, semi-clips, yeah, I love this shit
Plus an agua stick, nigga, we runnin' this shit, oh...

[Chorus: Daz Dillinger]
I smoke blunts, drink 'gnac
Bust caps at bitch niggas 'cause it's nothin' to me
Cuz I'm a gangsta
I gangbang, brains hangin', dope slangin'
That's the part of life of being a G
Cuz I'm a gangsta
Robbing banks, police shootouts, high speeds
And you know it ain't shit to me
Cuz I'm a gangsta
Blowin' dope up, like my 5, like my 10
It ain't shit, it ain't nothing but G
Cuz I'm a gangsta

[Verse 3]
[Kurupt]
Sippin' on Thunder Chicken in my neighborhood gear
Like what's happenin', muthafucka? There's a hood up in here
Straight Dogg Pound out like what's it about
You and me, or is it 'bout what's going on now?
I got something here, nigga, that'll force the crowd
To U-turn, muh'fucka, immediately, like now
There's only a few people who knows what's going down
The rest is headed the opposite direction right now, we hell hounds

[Daz]
Niggas is hellbound, burnin' in the fire
My desire is to keep a strap 'cause these niggas be liars
I'm required to keep a strap 'cause these niggas be wired
You know I keep it G until the day I expire
You know the gang code, we catch 'em slippin', let the gat explode
Now he drops to his knees, nigga, now the story told
Open book, public looking, laid dead on the pavement
He prayed all day but the Lord couldn't save him
All the dumb shit he did caught up to him, bitch
Now he shot up as Swiss cheese, found in a ditch
Pass a couple of they homies now we empty the clip
Nigga, this Dogg Pound Gangsta Crip, niggas know now

[Chorus: Daz Dillinger]
I smoke blunts, drink 'gnac
Bust caps at bitch niggas 'cause it's nothin' to me
Cuz I'm a gangsta
I gangbang, brains hangin', dope slangin'
That's the part of life of being a G
Cuz I'm a gangsta
Robbing banks, police shootouts, high speeds
And you know it ain't shit to me
Cuz I'm a gangsta
Blowin' dope up, like my 5, like my 10
It ain't shit, it ain't nothing but G
Cuz I'm a gangsta
