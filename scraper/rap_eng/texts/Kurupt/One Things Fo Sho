All i do is keep it hood and snoop ain't nothin bout a fake eastwood
Low style wanna trip em baby style

You don’t put a ticket out but you don’t give a fuck
Every concert it’s fuck Shield and Kurupt
But you know what fuck you too this is what I gotta say to you
One, one thangs fo sho
And before I begin if you don’t know I’m talkin bout Snoop
Daz, Supa bitch and Black ass, aw fuck it the whole Dogg house staff
Peep it out he who lives without sin cast the first stone
At Gotti stallone, rollin rock, bounce down the streets, lets have all ball in city hall
Eminem I love yo raps but don’t talk about blacks
Why, cause then amma have to respond and knock all the tadpoles outta the pond
But Daz

[Chorus 1]

[Verse 3:]
Acting like a bitch I wish you would [x3]
You acting like a bitch I wish you would [x2]
Acting like a bitch I wish you would [x2]
Acting like a G, yeah you wish you could
See am all hood, gansta and a thug
Fuck Snoop but I love Uncle June Bug
Sorry Momma Lien but Daz is trippin
He need an old fashion ass whipping
Now lets get on big lip supa bitch
The imitation Kurupt the local street punk
Yeah I’m sure you know him soon as we cross paths amma fall on

[Chorus 2]
