When I met you last night, babe
And you let me roll the dice
You said I'd be your lucky lady
I hit those numbers all night

I can't lose, I can't lose
When I'm 'round you
I can't lose, I can't lose
Now that I found you
Oh yeah, uuh alright

I can turn your luck around, baby
Ain't no hotter hand in town
Come and stake your love on me
Come lay it on the line
I bet you never felt this way before
I bet you never seen so much action on the floor
Rollin' fever I'm on fire
And tonight I'm fully wild
You got to be my ace in the hole

I can't lose, I can't lose
When I'm 'round you
I can't lose, I can't lose
Now that I found you

Oh yeah, uuh alright

I bet you never seen so much action on the floor
Ohhh, so much action on the floor
I bet you never seen so much action on the floor
Ohhh, so much action on the floor
I bet you never seen so much action on the floor
So much,action on the floor
Action on the floor
So much,action on the floor
Action on the floor
So much,action on the floor
Action on the floor
So much,action on the floor
