[Verse 1]
I'm every womans dream
You know what I mean
Fresh in the scene, mobbing with a lean
Living to the fullest, the only way I'm seen
Walking on the moon, feeling like a dream
You're every niggas dream, you know what Im saying
A Lil European mixed with Indonesian
A lil bit of Indian mixed with Palestinian
A little bit of greek she is super cute
She’s every womans dream seen on tv
Like Angelina Jolie she wants to fuck with  me
And I ain't mad at her, plus she’ll bring a friend
And after today we gon do this shit again
We gonne do this shit again, money to the ceiling
I'm living till it end, you can't cut me out you gotta cut me in
Rolling down the freeway banging Dr. Dre and Wayne
Im making money money never make the man
But it can affect  me and make a change who I am

[Chorus]
Sip a little bubbly, she's always thinking of me
I'm part of the game I guess thats why she love me
I'm part of the game, I'm part of the game, I’m part of the game
Sip a little bubbly she's always thinking of me
I'm part of the game  I guess thats why she love me
I'm part of the game game  I'm a part of the game I'm a part of the game
Sip a little bubbly she's always thinking of me I'm part of the game
I guess thats why she love me

[Verse 2]
I can't help myself, so I can't help you
But you could help me, let me tell you what to do
Just follow my lead, and you’ll never turn back
Imma give you what you need, and in return you give it back
Every woman wants a man that dont front
Always playing it back and giving what she wants
Never ever complaining and always come home
Right on time, like he say it on the phone
Every woman likes to always be right
Even when she’s wrong she’ll keep it outta sight
The fact that she knows you know who is right
No need to fight just get a bloody life
Every man wants a girl who dont want too much
She prop the perfect up front (2:03) my type of girl she love  what I like
And what I like to turn tables in the mike
Every woman’s dream seen her on tv like Angelina Jolie
She wants to fuck with me and i ain't mad at her and plus she’ll bring
A friend and after tonight we gon do this shit again

[Chorus]
