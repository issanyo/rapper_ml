[Verse 2: Louiie B]
Man, come and take a walk with me
If it’s broke conversation don’t talk to me
A couple hunned on the shades, like it cost to see
They say they chance oh, lookin like they lost to me
L, praise the Lord, let the choir sing, C notes
What yall mad at me for?
I’m sippin on cliko
Hold up, one Nino
My bitches in Puerto Rico
Know what I’ve been through, I don’t think so
So many cars I’m Mr. Repo
What you think I’d do with one
Everywhere that I perform
Bitches scream Louie
I am who they clappin for
Put my horn on the head, now she unicorn
I ball hard and my major art is uniform
OMG, I am ill
Tell them niggas stop frontin
The inside of my pockets – all hunneds
And I’m flyer than all of yall
Oh I do it big, I can never do it small as yall

[Hook]
Tell me I’m the man, man, you already know, know
Boy I do it big big and never be broke broke
I’m about my bread bread , you left in the roll roll
On your mark, get set set, green light go!
Go! Go! Go! Green light go!
Go! Go! Go! Green light go! Go!
Shades so dark, chain just glow
I don’t never stop
Green light go!

Go! Go! Go! Green light go!
Go! Go! Go! Green light go!
