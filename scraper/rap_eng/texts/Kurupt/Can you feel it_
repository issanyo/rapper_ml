[Intro]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, uh, bangers, rollers, riders, what's up?

[Chorus: Potion]
Can you feel it? Can you feel it?
Can you feel it? Can you feel it?
Woaaaaaaoooh!
Can you feel it? Can you feel it?
Woaaaaaaoooh!
Can you feel it? Can you feel it?

[Verse 1: Kurupt]
Man, all around the world, so many different states
So many different faces
So many gun cases
[?] time on my level now
So many different placements,separable branches
Hard to have a good time, because I don't club
Become a single buster, thinking it's no good!
Make it happen with that [?]
Pop these little niggers down
We all trying to come up
Always remember my plan
The world will change again
[?], you might have to go back
To everywhere you've been!
Drop of a dime, drop of a hat
Ticket to the front, now bring it all back!
Diamond in the back, Cadillac stack
Got a joy dangling it and show them where the party's at!
Break it down for me!

[Chorus: Potion]

[Verse 2: Kurupt]
Where the house party at?
In the hood near you
Come in to the hood, let me show you what we do
Round them up, ask them if [?] cracking
With all the little hood-rats throwing some action!
Tonight I'm going to get a little homie laid
And show him how to go for the party parade!
G to the T, everybody
There's a couple of little busters in the party!
I'm a Shanghai knight, rolling with the black knights
Got them coming to L.A
Go do it all night, and do it all day
And grab a couple of hood mamas and see what they say!
You're in or you're out
You're out or you're in!
Together we ride, together we spin
Together we move, together we dip
Together we roll, together we trip
Break it down for me!

[Chorus: Potion]

[Bridge]
Now make them move something, now make them break it down
Sea-walk homie, walk round and round
Now make them move something, make them break it down!

[Verse 3: Kurupt]
Nigga, California love, on a loan
Got to let these funny-ass motherfuckers know
It's all about thieves on the streets, in the streets
And that's what makes [?] complete!
Nigga, California love, so loud
And that's what makes California so proud!
To all my Latino homies, you keep smashing
And that goes to all my Latino assassins!
Break it down for me!

[Chorus: Potion]

[Outro]
Break it down, break it down
Yeah, you know what I'm talking about?
Hey, what's up girl?
Now break it down for me
Keeping it real hood, it's the hood party, [?] crackers, you know, uh-uh, it's full of grown fuckers!
Now make them move something, now make them break it down
Sea-walk homie, walk round and round
Now make them move something, make them break it down!
