[Verse]
We're for real. My friends went all the way to Death Row
It's either big money or no money
This muther fuck ( 0:11 inaudible)
... Code three
There was nothing to connect us to the guy from what happened. Zelch
Back up fool! You don't want to see no real gangstas
I got them at gunpoint
Listen to me! There are many more men who are experiencing the pain injustice. There's a
Revolution coming very soon!
(Guns firing)

[Outro]
Yeah! Rise! Kurupt done got it. Welcome to the hood zone nigga
Die nigga!
