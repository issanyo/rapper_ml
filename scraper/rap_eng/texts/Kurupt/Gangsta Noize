[Hook]
Who's that makin that Gansta Noize? (That's Kurupt)
Dippin through just not giving a fuck, bitch (That's Kurupt)
Gangsta's in this muthafucka givin it up (That's Kurupt)

[Kurupt]
Bitch Nigga, touch me, nigga, and I touch you back
Rush me nigga and I'll pop off this
And push you back, chest hit back
Shells up and the West hit back
So bitch nigga just get back
Bitch boy just don't know how to act
I'ma have to clap like an applause and make him sit back
Cus bitch boy just won't get back
Focus like scanners, file load to memo randoms
I'ma leave ya numb, peel like bananas

[Kurupt]
Deal me in and I'll deal you out
Liable to put something in your mouth
Make my day and I'll make ya year
Just when you appear
You make a U-turn, and then disappear
I guess it's clear
No bitch ass bitch made muthafuckas allowed in here
Give me a pistol I'll give you a cannon
Put it to your face and then start rammin
I heard gangsta rap music, they're gonna start bannin
I'm planning, to make gangsta rap music in Canada
To shift the parameter
Quake the equator, Young Gotti muthafucka
Eminent danger, bitch nigga

[Kurupt]
I can't smoke no more weed in the red form
I need to concentrate in the pill form
Call the homies, start off the swarm
Show 'em it's on
First one to bomb, Southern Vietnam
California Cong
Studied game like the Muslims studied a Koran
Back On The Smash, Kurupt and Daz
Two to the spleen, Kurupt and Mike Dean
The hoes gotta go, Kurupt and Roscoe
Blastin Roscoe into Young Assassins
The methods of a ridaz, Snoop and Tha Eastidaz
Two to the head, yeah, what up Fred?
With so many hoes givin all the head
Can't you see Nate and Warren G?
These the muthafuckas that be rollin with me
We control whole, patrol the streets, nigga
Inquiries of vocabulary you need
But we ignore bitches when they tryin to speak
Talking 'bout..
