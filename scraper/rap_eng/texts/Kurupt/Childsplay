Intro]
The fire is here
You know what I’m talkin bout?
It’s simple mathematics man
It’s game, it’s like a game of chess
I’m balling out of neighborhood like what happening

[Verse: Kurupt]
I’m riding round with 38’s, my money long, my money straight
My money strong, my money grown
My money on, my money make
Mo money, mo money
Mo money, money make
Money come, money go
Little mo, my tummy ache

[Verse: Trensetta]
I got a high metabolism, I aviate, aviate
I’m still eatin off 95 with the same squad I aided Nate
And I’m still eating with the same squad and I’m still making that same plate
Still weighing that same weight, too tall, 88
Give a smaller demonstration, demonstration, demonstrate
Everything is supposed to be since 95, since 98
Since 99 in Dire Straits, with 99’s with fire grades
I like er mine, she’s a fine size, she’s like her mom

In her face, in her face, shoot that in her face
In her face, in her face, shoot that in her face
In her face, in her face, shoot that in her face
In her face, in her face, shoot that in her face

[Verse: Kurupt]
Play me in this game, we can go all night
Got this thing on lock like we got all strikes
We coast youngin, get initiated

All yall haters can’t mess with me
