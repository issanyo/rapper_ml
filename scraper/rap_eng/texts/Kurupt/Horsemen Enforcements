[Ras Kass]
Killah Priest, Canibus, Kurupt, Ras Kass
Horsemen. Enforcement
MATRIX, NIGGA!

[Kurupt]
We, reconstruct (horseman)
Re-decompose, disassemble
The thirteenth member
Around the compound of 15 soldiers
Lead by four to start off the war

[Ras]
FEE, FI, FO, FUM! I smell the blood like Nosferatu
Inhale invisible death like CO2
Slum you, your label mates, and your CEO too
See we know you, nigga, IOU

[Kurupt]
Cockin the heat, miser, feel the heat, dunn
The elite and street sweep
Pop hollow chrome, holla
Separate your collar-bone, marauder
Neo alotta(?), the anointed, don't get pin-pointed
Yeah, you bout to spread, we comin for head
Horseman, headless
The tactical tech technical technique torturous technician
Hybrid, the virus spread miles around
Miles and miles, bodies found in piles for miles

[Ras]
You niggas comedy with that gangsta rap
That shit's comedy like Bernie Mac doing Beanie Sigel fuckin rap
Like magic how funny niggas disappear your fame
Damon Wayans vs David Blaine, tuck your chain
(hell in a hand basket.... fight back...)

[Ras]
Kick in the door wavin the 4-4 (what?!)
To hit these niggas with these ill metaphors (what?!)
Forever raw, forever love that hardcore (what?!)
Horsemen, bring the World War Four (what?!)

[Ras]
We run these concrete streets, sportin cleats
Ain't nothin sweet (faggot!)
That harocyglemic(??) rap is weak!
I swing machetes and chop niggas legs off complete
Glue your ankles to your palms: meet the agony of defeat (the feet)

[Kurupt]
You can't push me, believe it
I bash niggas til they paraplegic
The source, the force, the flame!
The inner duct, the powder, the outer, the frame
We the horsemen, fuck the game!
