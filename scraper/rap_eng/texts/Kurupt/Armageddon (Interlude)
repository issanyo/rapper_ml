[Intro]
Smoke sumthin'
Yeah nigga
Kurupt Young Gotti
Cypress Hill
Westcoast
From bouncing and banging
Throw them hands up high
And blast to the sky
Blast on everything you see
Cos we don't give a fuck
And blast to the sky

This is more than warfare this is Armageddon
Where the thoughts and intellect get threatened
Where the hostile become hostages
Wrapped and packed like sausages
My vocals soothe the air like voices and throat lozengers
Tucked in cottages, wondering where the cabbages
Lavishes, sold to the worst of savages
Fabulous, ilaverious, praises amazes
Stuns and sparks, throats like arcs
Lights the dark, brainwaves conveys
So I know what u thinking
You show what u thinking
Add up the currents and volts
Erase everything u thought u thought u thought
Busters look just like me
Mistake the launch quakes and get bust by me
Push on nigga or get pushed over
Subtle soldiers, sculptures, nigga we vultures
Super ninjas hitting muthafuckas like supernovas
Swift hands, little nigga with super shoulders
I'ma Supersoak one of u set back niggas
So for the game's sake nigga GET BACK NIGGAZ
Or get launched off on niggas
What you say Muggs? Man we don't love yall bitches
