[Chorus]
Kill if you wanna kill, it's the blood rush
Say what you wanna say, it's the blood rush
Brawl if you wanna brawl, it's the blood rush
Roll if you wanna ball, it's the blood rush
Kill if you wanna kill, it's the blood rush
Say what you wanna say, it's the blood rush
Brawl if you wanna brawl, it's the blood rush
Roll if you wanna ball, it's the blood rush

[Omega G]
Another click means more trouble, plenty your ass
Single life, droppin' the ways, vehicles and cash
Gettin' creative wit the drugs, mix the weed wit the hash
Get the liquor in your system, then you quick ta blast
Bein' faded is like steroids
Look at your chest, lift your head when you wit your boys
Tryin' ta make some noise
Personalities all the same, but swissy
Different faces like menage-a-trois, hit it and flee
To other states, get away, now I'm takin' this trip
No destination, move along, no more cig-a-retes
Stay empty handed, under one condition
Paraphenalia and pistol equals cop trippin'
Who needs the ass whippin'?
Playa hatas comin' wit excuse ta pop up
But I refuse to be a victim, so confront on the jump
I gives a fuck, who the hell they think I endin' out bust
Comin' from the A to Z, snitchas bleed from the gut

[Chorus]
Kill if you wanna kill, it's the blood rush
Say what you wanna say, it's the blood rush
Brawl if you wanna brawl, it's the blood rush
Roll if you wanna ball, it's the blood rush
Kill if you wanna kill, it's the blood rush
Say what you wanna say, it's the blood rush
Brawl if you wanna brawl, it's the blood rush
Roll if you wanna ball, it's the blood rush

[Bookie]
Uh, Uh
No relaxin' when I be testin', I ain't feelin' right
Got you blessin' from the correction', bustin' all night
Blood is rushin', from all the cussin', got a nigga flushin'
Any known nigga that's down for fussin', hands up
Niggas call me the captain nigga when I lead
Time ta serve with the permanent cut that's deep enough ta bleed
A demon, I'm out for the killin', so fuck the breathin'
Representin' my block, on the dice from the cops
On and on 'til it's all gone
Bookie's erasin' wit the domination, cuttin' like Jason
So turn the lights on
I won't feel it, behead a drastic for a niggas hearin'
Automatic enough ta panic, permanently spittin'
When I'm rollin', see I'm controllin', it's my destination
Now you knowin' just where I'm goin' wit my conversation
A real nigga you facin', gimme enough ta bust
And get a quick demonstration, representin' like Perry Mason

[Chorus]
Kill if you wanna kill, it's the blood rush
Say what you wanna say, it's the blood rush
Brawl if you wanna brawl, it's the blood rush
Roll if you wanna ball, it's the blood rush
Kill if you wanna kill, it's the blood rush
Say what you wanna say, it's the blood rush
Brawl if you wanna brawl, it's the blood rush
Roll if you wanna ball, it's the blood rush

[Sabataj]
Blood rush, slugs bust, ain't no love from us
What the fuck can I live wit the money I lust?
Trust God, but still trust all of my heat
]From the pumps to the .22's, ain't shit sweet?
Hustle and run streets, stack chips ta splurge
Bag chicks for the swerve 'til they get on my nerves
I know you heard how this nigga, cockin' name
Rain down on your parade, cats get sprayed
Y'all ain't even gotta name 'til you reach my stats
Peep my cats on the creep, jet black in the Ac
Packin' the mack like Big Pun, bust wit big guns
In it for the fame, but really the big funds
Leave you on the run, everytime you squeal
Y'all cats know the deal, I'ma bring it to you real
If you thinkin' of comin' wit it, you still gonna get it
Admit it, you just lost, you floss, it's blood rush

[Chorus]
Kill if you wanna kill, it's the blood rush
Say what you wanna say, it's the blood rush
Brawl if you wanna brawl, it's the blood rush
Roll if you wanna ball, it's the blood rush
Kill if you wanna kill, it's the blood rush
Say what you wanna say, it's the blood rush
Brawl if you wanna brawl, it's the blood rush
Roll if you wanna ball, it's the blood rush

[Kurupt]
All I wanna do is make a dime
And remain unseen and hard ta find
It seems like everybody's tryin' ta snatch
Somethin' that I make, they tryin' ta take
I'm like fuck that shit
Why you all up on my back?
Just tryin' ta steal the rims off my Cadillac
Rollin' down the street rollin' back ta back
Dippin' down the street where my homies at
Why you like ta play alot?
Snatchin' everything that you see
And tryin' ta snatch from me
Money ain't shit, homeboy
You gots ta get all you can get, homeboy
Cock my pistol back and spit, homeboy
And this is one thing you can't forget, homeboy
My homeboy Bookie said dip homey
So began ta dippin'
And I ain't trippin'
Got my clip, unload the clip in
Everything started fallin'
Not givin' a fuck homey
I'm rollin' wit my dogs and
All the rest of y'all can just eat fat dicks
Like that muthafucka
Get back muthafucka
I pull out my strap
I let it clap like that
Muthafucka
Ya best ta get back
I bust a cap
Muthafucka
And when you see me in the Cut
Best believe it be that nigga Daz chillin' wit Kurupt
Muthafucka

[Chorus]
Kill if you wanna kill, it's the blood rush
Say what you wanna say, it's the blood rush
Brawl if you wanna brawl, it's the blood rush
Roll if you wanna ball, it's the blood rush
Kill if you wanna kill, it's the blood rush
Say what you wanna say, it's the blood rush
Brawl if you wanna brawl, it's the blood rush
Roll if you wanna ball, it's the blood rush

[Outro]
Kill if you wanna kill, it's the blood rush
Say what you wanna say, it's the blood rush
Blood Rush
Kill if you wanna kill, it's the blood rush
Blood Rush
Blood Rush
Blood Rush
