Well...this is the party where the people get hardy
Where the party never just don't stop
So just clap your hands and stomp your feet
And make your body rock
Well....I'm D-A-Z, the MC of the night
Came here to jam just to rock the mic

A little of this and a little bit of that and a fat 50 sack

Shake it all around and let your boo-ty' swang
