Well it's a party
The lights are low and I'm seein everybody
Just havin some fun
And there's a cutie who's wavin' hi
Givin me the eye
I guess I'm gonna give him a try, but it's

[Chorus:]
Just a dance nothing more
Leave what happens on the floor
On the floor
You can look but you can't touch because
It's just a dance nothing more
What you need my number for
Ain't no need for you to even think romance

Cause it's just a dance

You might be thinkin'
That because we're dancin close
And we're vibin' that you're gonna get lucky
Take it easy, it's just a party
So let the dj do his thing and let the music play
Cause it's just a dance

I wanna enjoy the party and have fun like everybody
But your messin' up my groove
What did you come here to do
I won't be goin' home with you

[Chorus]
