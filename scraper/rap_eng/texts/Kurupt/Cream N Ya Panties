[Intro: DJ Quik + (Kurupt)]
Kick, snare, kick, snare, kick, snare, kick, snare
It’s DJ Quik and Kurupt, it’s DJ Quik and Kurupt
(Sup, Unc?) I’m tryna get ‘em off the wall
(Hey, and that’s what we do, we ball)

[Verse 1: DJ Quik + Kurupt]
I see you little sharks around me
I’m in my own raft, stupid, you can’t drown me
You see me in a sea of people but I’m not equal
I’m the prequel, I’m the subject in the peephole
I’m not your equal, there’s no sequel
End of discussion is nothin’
Party overpacked and combustin’, see, we over-bubble
And I’m ready for the trouble
Looking at little mama in her short short shorts
Showing that ass for sport—see, it’s a contest
This fool wanna check me, his girl got the perfect contoured breast
And she loves this, D to a T, original like E.T
Chocolate Thai and indo weed
You know it’s me, DPG
And it’s me, Mister Blake, with the cake that’s cheesy
So let’s drop it

[Chorus: DJ Quik]
Cream in ya panties, hands in the air all night
Baby, pop that twat (Got it)
I see why your pants keep poppin’ off
Drop your knot, take a shot at a player that’ll take ‘em off
(Anytime I come through) Winter, spring, summer fall
(Doin’ what I wanna do) I gotta keep you off the wall
(Each and every one of you all)

[Verse 2: DJ Quik + Kurupt]
And that’s what we do, we ball
Indica, sinister, little mama love me
And I ain’t mad, I’m just in the club
Drinking something that I can’t pronounce
And I’ma spill each and every ounce
I invented this bounce, ‘cause DJ Quik did it
When you was just a kid, it wasn’t crowded, we was wit’ it
We was down, I kicked down the doors for the Eastside
Snoop, Mack 10, Nate Dogg, and the Pound
I even produced Eazy-E
Nine years later, I was working with the D-R-E
Yo, give me what want
All I really want is a little bit to you and your girlfriend too
Together we can do what we really want to
Tryna make it happen like 4, 3, 2, 1
You know I’m the one; all I’m tryna do is have a little bit of fun
Do it ‘til it’s done, so drop it

[Chorus: DJ Quik]
Cream in ya panties, ass in the air all night
Baby, pop that twat (Got it)
I see why your pants keep poppin’ off
Drop your knot and take a shot at a player that’ll take ‘em off
(Anytime I come through) Winter, spring, summer fall
(Doin’ what I wanna do) I gotta get you off the wall
(Each and every one of you all)

[Verse 3: Tre Mak + (DJ Quik)]
And that’s what we do, we ball
So clean, so young, so fly
Big boy rims sitting up so high
Come fuck with a boss, mama, I’m that guy
I ball so easy, no, I don’t try
Truth in the booth, man, I sell no lies
Niggas all in your ear but to hell with them guys
Yeah, don’t it feel so good, so right
Diamonds in my ear, so clear, so bright
Girl, you know you really here for the night
Stop playing, turn your phone off, don’t dim the lights
And I’ma do the things that you really really like
Like pull up to your crib on a brand new bike
Might put you on a flight just to kick it for the night
Break out the Patron and pour it over a little ice
The life that I’m living, man, I never think twice
If I got it in the bank, I’m tryna spend it all tonight
(So let’s go drop it)

[Chorus: DJ Quik]
Cream in ya panties, hands in the air all night
Baby, pop your twat (Got it)
I see why your pants keep poppin’ off
Drop your knot and take a shot at a player that’ll take ‘em off
(Anytime I come through) Winter, spring, summer fall
(Doin’ what I wanna do) I gotta get you off the wall
(Each and every one of you all)
