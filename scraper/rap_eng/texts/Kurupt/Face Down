[Intro:J. Black Tone Terrace Martin]
Im from the land of the c’s and b’s, where niggas smoke trees and roll them gold D’s
Where niggas fucking hood rap and catch a good c’s where niggas carry rocks and pray Oh lord please!
Hahahah

Where niggas dat trip we pull the Glock from the hip
Bustis fucked up start the talk a lot of shit (shit) nigga don’t believe me well we’ll bust your lip
Or else

[Chorus:J. Black Tone Terrace Martin]

[Verse 2:Kurupt]
Look, im living to live. I’m born to get it another one
Storm and triping is on,  I’m tripping as soon as I saw him I started reaching grabbing my gun yea
I saw him reaching its survival of the fittest though i'mma boil and bleach him like
That's the sound
Of the flames from these hood meringues we ain't got m6's tanks
But we just bought beens we got eagles that stretch and they fly and sing maliant melodies murdering stinks
Yo im one to fuck around with theses zoo babies cuz we swarm and sting like raising bees

[Chorus:J. Black Tone Terrace Martin]
