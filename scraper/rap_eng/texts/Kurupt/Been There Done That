[Verse 1: Petey Pablo]
Carolina Bird Dog
You niggas is lucky
???????
??
Motherfuckers hot for the moment
But when the moment's over
And the roller coaster you been coasting on
Comes to a halt and the conductor pull the handle on ya'
You ain't got shit to kick up the paper
What it cost
And he waving his hand for ya', telling y'all to come off
You ain't got no more tickets and everything closed
You look down in my hand and I'm holding the Row
And you know in your soul
I'm a loner, I don't fuck with y'all
Never have, never will
Nigga I don't fuck with y'all
Them ain't my homeboys
I just spit on their tracks
I sent the call for em'
And they ain't call back
I guess they got caught up in what the hood call a big head
Get the nigga that did shit for y'all for no bread
Next time ya' see me out
Ain't a need in acting scared
Just close your mouth and turn your head
Before I predict that I'm a

[Hook: Petey Pablo] 2x
Hop, skip, and a jump
Away from the pen
Been there done that
My niggas miss me in there
If a nigga out here fuck up I'm gonna tear in his ass
This nigga here is short a couple cards in the deck

[Verse 2: Petey Pablo]
I'm so awesome, I perform when I walk
I'm a monster
No ??? I gotta be responsible for
I hit hard and plus I'm armed with firearms
So alert the security, tell em to get prepared for it
Holy moses, jeeper creeper, this nigga throwed off
I done dropped all of my marbles in the floor of my car
Ready to brawl so give me some church hall
And turn up my vocals dog
And let me kick this track in the balls
Put me in this car before you take insurance off it
And I'm gonna drive this bitch until I blow the doors off it
And while you're at it, run in there, smash on em'
Turn over table, kick him in his asshole
Take the paper, grip him up and stick a lighter to him
Stay there and watch all of em' burn
Tired of talking to em'

[Hook] 2x

[Verse 3: Kurupt]
You ain't never did what you say you did
I seen so many different changes in the way you live
But I ain't tripping
You know I keep it straight O.G
And everything you think you done that you think I don't see
I don't fuck with these bustas
I don't fuck with these bustas
Let me explain myself
Let me restrain myself
Let me reflame myself
Nigga, black Chevrolet on all gold D's
Just too motherfucking original ??
It's me, and the army's in a Cutlass Supreme
Dipping through the streets
I got the heater, me and ?
On the way to ?????
I see y'all niggas and you just don't know it
It ain't nothing if you don't live for it, motherfucker
I'm gonna show these niggas by not even responding
Just posted, heater staying open minded
Cause I'm a

[Hook] 2x
