[Chorus: Oliver Brown]
Face to face, you're in my space
And this time we cut right down to the chase
I'm respected, I'ma be collectin'
I'ma handle mine 'til it's perfected
Face to face, you're in my space
And this time we cut right down to the chase
I'm respected, I'ma be collectin'
I'ma handle mine 'til it's perfected

[Verse 1: Kurupt]
Talon tucker and a greater rhyme dumper
Me and Snoopy just dippin', bangin' on these muthafuckas
Off the 'urple in this bitch, bangin' on these little bustas
We gon' show you niggas how you s'posed to twerk the little hustle
Nigga, watch, learn, and see what the K hit
'Cause when we hit the party, shit gets archaic
Gators, perms, Deuce and a Quarters
G shit, pimp shit, always crack a bitch shit
Next time I see a bitch I might place an order
Like, 'bitch, make sure you meet me in about a quarter
And make sure you bring the Henn, bring about a quarter
'Cause I'm tryna smoke, bitch, and that's an order
I'm too DPG'd up, little pony
Your big homeboy got socked by my little homie
I got a 6-6 Impala, top dollar
I pop more than my collar if your bitch is tryna holla

[Chorus: Oliver Brown]
Face to face, you're in my space
And this time we cut right down to the chase
I'm respected, I'ma be collectin'
I'ma handle mine 'til it's perfected

[Verse 2: Snoop Dogg]
I had dreams of a pimp mixed with a  little player
Up all night, see, other kids couldn't stay up
Drink with my momma all day, Schlitz Malt
And go into the liquor, steal and get caught
"Ring My Bell," first record that I bought
I learned how to squab hangin' at King Park
My homeboy D-Dawg, he turned me onto B-ball
And then he threw me a sack, said 'this how we ball'
And before you know it
If it's money on the Eastside, I gotta go get it, I'm down for it
Fly as a muh'fucka, hoes know it
I gangbang on the sizide and down to show it
I came from nickels to dubs, I did that
On the wrong side, now I'm on the right side
Used to say he wouldn't ride, now you say he might ride
Nigga fell in love with the late night, dub life, hood life
Now tell me what it look like
So poor, sleeping on the floor, not a good life
Is what we reach for every day
Player, that's the only way a nigga wanna play
I can't fuck with the bitch if she don't pay
Money, attention, attention, money
Lick your thumbs and peel mine back
It's real like that 'cause I feel like that

[Chorus: Oliver Brown]
Face to face, you're in my space
And this time we cut right down to the chase
I'm respected, I'ma be collectin'
I'ma handle mine 'til it's perfected

[Verse 3: Daz]
You know I'm back hustlin', got to get it on
Ain't no, ain't no stoppin', gotta ball 'til I fall
Armor All my tires, shine 'em up, rims, nigga, ain't nothin'
Big faces, homeboy, in the ride straight jumpin'
6-6 swervin' down the highway
Yeah, your bitch, yeah, she doin' it my way
Gotta respect it or catch a hot one in a second
I get stupid for the fetish, get G'd up 'cause I'm breadish
Where you headed, homie? Yeah, no one knows
I'll keep it to myself 'cause bullshit is bad for a nigga health
I asked the question last week, yeah, how did it felt
When I had to grab the AK straight off the shelf (Blaow!)
I spray you down, lay you down, stay around
Be found, slumped, dead, homie, all the way 'cross town
This is what is, G shit on the set
We stay connected, disrespect it and we break your neck, cuz

[Chorus: Oliver Brown]
Face to face, you're in my space
And this time we cut right down to the chase
I'm respected, I'ma be collectin'
I'ma handle mine 'til it's perfected
