[Kurupt (Daz)]
I told the bitch I'd cry for you, I'd die for you, I lied to you
But getting the pussy is all I tried to do
It's me Kurupt bitch, and I'm a rider, I'll ride ya
Roll up beside ya, serve ya dick like an appetizer
Tasty as fuck
I know ya wanna fuck me bitch, my name's Kurupt
I told ya, see gotcha ya Feenin like Jodeci
It's Dat Nigga Daz, bitch did ya notice me?)
Yeah, see we out with tha crew, when we chillin in the back bitch
So what ya wanna do? (Whatcha wanna do?)

I wanna fuck him, I wanna fuck him and I wanna fuck you
So what's your name?

Devante Swing
And that's K-Ci, and that's my brother Dalvin...
And that's Jo-Jo, so, whats happenin?
Anything can happen from the way these hoes is acting
I see it like a picture, It's all up in my mind
See all I see is ass, and me hittin it from behind
(I wanna uhhhh ahhhh)
Pumpin like the old days
Bitch ya got your hooks in me just like the O'Jays

[Chorus]
If you come up, get done up
Inside and let me run up
Come up, get done up
Inside and let me run up [2x]
Come up to my room

[K-Ci]
I recognize you
You was in the hotel lobby
You were lookin damn good
I was sweatin' at the after party
I told you to come with me
I wanted you to freak with me
Keep the message from your mama
I dont need no drama

[Chorus]

[Jojo]
A piece of mind, a piece of mind, a piece of mind
Is hard to find
So dont waste time
No, no, no, no, no, no
From the side, from behind, in your eye
How ever you want it
There's no tellin what I'll do
When you come into my room

[Chorus]

[Jodeci]
I'm feelin kinda lonely tonight
I need someone to do me so right
(I'm lookin for a woman, I'm lookin for my baby)
Don't be afraid to come to my room
Just be prepared to stay until noon

[Chorus multiple times]
