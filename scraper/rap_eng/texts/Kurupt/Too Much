[Intro]

[Verse 1: Petey Pablo]
Don't blame me for your misfortune
It ain't my fault, hell I ain't know
When I drove up the door was open
I ain't know the nigga live with Shorty
I ain't do the shit to spite the homey
I'm only going on what Shorty told me
Said she was alone and tired of being lonely
Needed a direct number to call me
So I hit her off and kept on rolling
Hit me later on, we'll work on something
If I knew then what I'm now knowing
I swear to god I would of left her alone

[Hook] 4x
Don't love me
Too much

[Verse 2: Eastwood]
Catch me in that six squatting on twenty-twos
And I don't want you following me peeping what it do, Ma
Don't need that harassing and asking why I come home late
When I just walked out your house around a quarter till eight
So a, miss me Baby with all them bogus phone calls
Giving a nigga head just to smell a nigga balls
Look Petey, ? man she back on that bullshit
Claiming she hella freaky sucking on hella hood dicks
Stacy and Erica cool, but they gotta roll
Cause they done flipped all the homies on Death Row
Left Coast to West Coast, yeah we the best Coast
And if you love me too much
Baby, you gotta get ghost

[Hook] 4x

[Verse 3: Kurupt]
You know
And I know
That we know
And she know
That he know
D-E-A-T-H R-O-W
Yeah bitch, what bitch
Kurupt bitch
Shut the fuck up bitch
You know just the other day I was all on D's
And plucking ho's off like ticks and fleas
I'm hood, and your not
Cause it's cracking once the door locks
I thought you knew about God
I thought you knew about Pac
I rock and cop blocks


[Hook] 4x
