[Children speaking]
Jimmy Bones

[Kurupt & Roscoe]
Oh yeah, this is really, really real baby
Really, really real, yeah
Let me tell ya something, J-I-M-M-Y
This is about a real nigga, real nigga
Jimmy Bones, Jimmy, Jimmy, Jimmy
Jimmy Bones, Jimmy, Jimmy, Jimmy

[Hook]
They say the J-I-M-M-Y the B-the O-N-E-S, it's Jimmy
Jimmy Bones motherfucker, it's Jimmy
Get cha' chrome motherfucker, it's Jimmy
They say the J-I-M-M-Y the B-the O-N-E-S, it's Jimmy
Jimmy Bones motherfucker, it's Jimmy
Get cha' chrome motherfucker, it's Jimmy

[Verse 1]
This is a tale, a serious tale
About a real motherfucker with a serious bale
With a serious limp, conversation of a pimp
Big Jimmy Bones, in a class of his own
He used to roam around the streets with a driver to drive him
And always kept a heated nigga right beside him
Jimmy Bones, he used to take care of home
Take care of his own, my nigga Jimmy Bones
You know what they say nigga (What's that)
Everything turns full circle
And the closest to you always hurts you
Hop out the cars and bail down the streets
Helpin' families to eat, like it's supposed to be
Back stabbers, they come a dime a dozen
They can be as close to you as your brothers and cousins
Take the nigga out the hood but not the hood out the nigga
Twittlin' the switch blade, Jimmy Bones nigga

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
This is a tale, a serious tale
About a serious nigga with a serious bale
With a serious limp, he's a serious pimp
Jealous niggas might try to twist up
Twist a pimp, try to twist shit like licorice sticks
Mad at what they don't have, mad at what they do get
Actin' like niggas really do shit
Shit, bust just like a Mercedes
Jimmy Bones, got all the ladies
But dames is nothin'
Look, let me show ya something
All that really mattered to J.B. was home
His woman super bad, Misses Jimmy Bones
His homie came with game, so refreshin' and fine
Jimmy said, that's yo dream, that ain't mine
Tryin' to take him out the hood with plots and schemin'
Jimmy said you can go, I ain't never leavin'
Ol' sucker ass nigga in cahoots with the police
Crooked than a motherfucker, tryin' to control the streets
So they twisted up, ol', slim Jim
And so you ain't get twisted, made em' all join in
That's the police for ya, crooked as a lawyer
And really can't do a got damn thing for ya
When he went to the meeting, his homies there, the police there
Another nigga there, his woman there the only one that cares
But still, twist went down
Oh shit, niggas better watch out now

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Jimmy's revenge, he's been gone for years
It's been known for years
And since Jimmy's been gone
Everybody's done grown
Houses and homes, some have four kids
And some planned for a future to have more kids
Some doin' the same shit, and some petrified
All except one better be glad Jimmy died
Threw Jimmy a bomb and still stayin' down
The soul still roams around through the Earth underground
Hell hounds nigga, lives ain't worth a quarter
Livin' life through animals, mothers, and daughters
This spot, you'll never ever touch again
You'll never leave once you walk in to Jimmy's Revenge
Yeah niggas Jimmy's back again
And this is a tale, a serious tale
About a serious nigga that you took for a joke
Thinkin' that a nigga was playin'
And deep inside, I can hear Jimmy's conscience sayin'

Am I overreactin', how am I supposed to be actin'
I feel like I should take more action
I found a new Bonnie and she's a loaded magnum
Yeah I love my heater, it's a fatal attraction
The dead don't die
But you will thinkin' that the lead won't fly
The truth will be known, exposed, and displayed
Eventually, for now I'm just sharpenin' my blade
You messin' with the J-I-M-M-Y the B- the O-N-E-S
It's Jimmy
