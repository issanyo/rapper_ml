With so much drama imma have to refocus [?]
Symptoms of a coma sleeping awaking baking
I drop bombs like Hiroshima
Elegant and [?] face bumping in mines
All she wanted to do is getting side
Than she got a side talking about "Let me ride"
I stay regulating since craytons was the daytons
Free Tracey Davis TC is chill
Cause ain't no fun if the homies can't have noone
And if Kurupt gave a fuck about a biatch
They already know that I don't fuck with no busters
And I don't fuck with no and I don't fucking no
So don't ask me shit, ain't give a fuck about a damn

Yelling one eight seven with my dick in her mouth biatch (x2)
