(Intro)
Rejects!
Rather R Gang nigga
With Kurupt though
We creeze ho
Tear the beat like this
Look here bitch

(Bridge x2)
If it ain’t OG, oh girl that’s a no no
I’m probably in the hood, probably been from the low low
We only getting money, we getting money for sure though
We only getting money, we getting money for sure though

(Hook)
You’re a hoe, you know you a hoe
(for sure though, ridin in a low low)
She a hoe, you know she a hoe
Man that’s yo wife? That’s my hoe though
And I take her to the show

(Verse)
Yea we take er to the movies, pop cool nigga
Showtime with me, at it block for an hour
Rejects nigga, Kurupt, yea we do it
You saw me in a low low, I’m probly with yo hoe though
Flash like a photo, brother watch your dodo
Side like a road though, probably with your hoe though
You all know we come though
My brother, show you how I do this
Listen what I do though
Grindin, smoke on some snoopy cal, pockets full of good
As we got all know what I’m good, my little bitch is cravin
That pussy peep, we shut yo eyes, stretchers like paramedics
But you don’t talk me, don’t talk me bust like your probators
I’m shittin, hand me a diaper
Bitch I res a pound, you’re ridin it in a piper
But I relate this as they actin McKay Pfeiffer
Just to wipe a hoe, officer willin that tiger

(Bridge x2)
If it ain’t OG, oh girl that’s a no no
I’m probably in the hood, probably been from the low low
We only getting money, we getting money for sure though
We only getting money, we getting money for sure though

(Hook)
You’re a hoe, you know you a hoe
(for sure though, ridin in a low low)
She a hoe, you know she a hoe

(Verse)
You got some chopstick, nigga I’m hard
I don’t even know why but my lips is dry
I’ve been smoking these cookies all day
Breakin off this motherfuckin tanga ray
Oh, out my body, out my mind
Stoned, I’m a high another kind (leave me alone)
Even when I’m home I’m ridin
Gone, bitch I might bring a fight
I don’t er, she want me, man I bone er
If I hit it, I guarantee it’s a Honda, it’s a Hummer
Smoking it up, drinkin it up
Blankets, swipe it
In the bunk you’re talkin loud, breath stink
Now we thuggin it up and slum it every day
Bitches fuck with me the long way
When it comes to spittin game I’m a pro
Don’t check me my nigga, check yo tone

(Bridge x2)
If it ain’t OG, oh girl that’s a no no
I’m probably in the hood, probably been from the low low
We only getting money, we getting money for sure though
We only getting money, we getting money for sure though

(Hook)
You’re a hoe, you know you a hoe
She a hoe, you know she a hoe
