[Hook: Nate Dogg]
This is where I wanna be
Right here with my loved ones
Smokin on some weed
You've got chronic won't you light it up?

[Verse 1: Shade Sheist]
Now who's that kickin in the gate for the West?
Shade pop with flows that seep holes in your vest
Half nigga with the words
Half run up in your spot to talk shit
Where I'm from, we prone to lick shots
Now Dogg Pound Gangstas put me up on game (put me up on game)
Now that I'm here a lot of shit gon' change
Mister quick to buy a chain, mister let the chain hang
Showin off to broads, I'm mister quick to get to bang
Now you might catch Sheist gettin bent in every coast
Still the nigga with the heat gettin rid of every coat
Still fuckin with Mizz, we run triz when we bored
And you know I got the X, twenty's what they hittin for
See me if you wanna score, cause I got what you need
Or you can see me in the club, tinted SUV
Gettin in for free, I'm bout to make my name known
Sheist pull a heist in this bitch just to get it on (what.)

[Verse 2: Nate Dogg]
Check this out
You see, how I figure this thing
We can, all take over this game
If we, come together do this shit right
We can, all have a piece of the pie
You know, how I figured this out
I just, took a little trip down South
Soon as, I set foot off the plane
It was, just like a family thing
You know, the gangsta's hard to decieve
So I, took a little trip to the East
I'm not, slow so I can't wait for the game
I'm not, broke so I'm in bulletproof everything
When I, touch down it ain't like a think
They ain't, trippin off nothin but bank
So I, quickly dispose of my shank
If we, if we ain't got us nigga where could we hang?

[Hook: Nate Dogg]

[Verse 3: Kurupt]
Yeah, show me somethin I ain't never seen
I step in the house party with a gangsta lean
Dogg Pound Gangstas we strikin back again (back again)
Ready to ride in the 'lac again {*tires squeal*}
Givin it up for T-Boz and Mack 10 for doin it
This ain't nothin but a gangsta reunion
New York and California, the places to be
Nate Dogg and Kurupt broadcast for free
We at the DoggHouse where the dogs at
You wanna get with me?
Baby meet me in the back
Young Damion Young, this is number two
Ridin out homie doin what we wanna do
