("Better tell your soldiers")

[Intro: Kurupt}
Yeah, you know we've been doin' this for so many years, man Makin' it real big, you understand me?
MC Eiht, Kurupt Young Gotti
I mean, we all we got, you understand me?
West Coast!
We got DJ Premier in the buildin', makin' it happen with us
What's up, day one?
I mean, I can only do it like this
Gettin' g-gettin' high
High, High
I can only do what I do best
The rest is a mystery
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
You know me myself and I
All I know is, the way we do it

[Hook: Eazy E & MC Eiht]
Gettin' g-gettin' higher than a muthafucka
Niggas know what's up
I'm that gangsta gangsta, is that what they're still yellin'
Higher than a muthafucka
Know what's up
I'm that gangsta gangsta
G-gettin' higher than a muthafucka
Niggas know what's up
I'm that gangsta gangsta, is that what they're still yellin'
Higher than a muthafucka
Know what's up
I'm that gangsta gangsta
G-gettin' higher
Geah, geah, geah!
Uh-huh, Blue Stamp official
Kurupt Young Gotti!
Gettin' high
We gotta get 'em
Keep it real hood
Beatin' them down, loc
("Better tell your soldiers")
Geah, check it out
Geah geah!

[Verse 1: MC Eiht]
I run laps 'round niggas, loc, relays
I keep this muthafucka hood for the DJs
AK's in the trunk, geah, set it off
Hotbox in the whip, everybody cough
We ain't soft muthafucka, geah, the block go
Couple bitches get to trippin', cuh, let 'em know ("Fall back")
About the muthafuckin' bread, on that, feel lead
Here's a toast to the West, one shot to the head
Either the pistol or the glass refill
Kickback, hit dat muthafucka and chill
You don't even know the shooters when they surround the place
Remind me of 3rd Bass, give 'em the Gas Face
Geah, P.E. number one
Still a menace, where these muthafuckin' niggas is from?
(Ay where you from nigga?!)
Geah, stay calm ("Fall back")
And tear up the spot 'cause you know it's the bomb

[Hook: Eazy E & Kurupt]
G-gettin' higher than a muthafucka
Niggas know what's up
I'm that gangsta gangsta, is that what they're still yellin'
Higher than a muthafucka
Know what's up
I'm that gangsta gangsta
G-gettin' higher than a muthafucka
Niggas know what's up
I'm that gangsta gangsta, is that what they're still yellin'
Higher than a muthafucka
Know what's up
I'm that gangsta gangsta
G-gettin' higher
Aw man
Smokin' on some of that bomb, doin' the do, y'hear me?
Ain't nuthin' else to do but relax with the homies in a picnic
Smokin' on that bomb shit
Got them Moonrocks, them Kurupt Moonrocks
If you're tryna get high, y'know what I'm sayin'
("Better tell your soldiers")
(Ay, what up, my nigga?)
Aw man

[Verse 2: Kurupt]
My bitch is trippin', my mind is gone
I don't make funny raps or love songs
I'm a menace (my nigga) that's right
And that's everything that baby girl likes
Feelin' heavy, sedated
The game's equated
The lames are hatin'
I'm glad that I made it another day ("Fall back")
Westside story where the story is told
In the land of the homies with the Daynas and Vogues
Ready or not, here I am
Katrina is my bitch, I'm breakin' levees and dams
I'm the man, muthafucka
I'm the man, muthafucka
Toucan Sam, muthafucka
Double nickel approach
Trouble, stick 'em and roll
Never gave a fuck about a hoe, muthafucka
For real'a, guerrilla, muthafucka
At Coachella with Jhen√© Aiko, muthafucka

[Hook: Eazy E &  MC Eiht]
G-gettin' higher than a muthafucka
Niggas know what's up
I'm that gangsta gangsta, is that what they're still yellin'
Higher than a muthafucka
Know what's up
I'm that gangsta gangsta
G-gettin' higher than a muthafucka
Niggas know what's up
I'm that gangsta gangsta, is that what they're still yellin'
Higher than a muthafucka
Know what's up
I'm that gangsta gangsta
G-gettin' higher
Geah, Geah!
Back at 'em again
Brenk Sinatra on the beat
My nigga day one in the buildin'
Geah
("Better tell your soldiers")

[Verse 3: MC Eiht]
I'm down the boulevard, trunk full of beat bang
Shotgun with the heat while my bitch sang (Hey!)
Mama, I'm in love with a G
Damn right, got game, then the pussy is free
Paper cup in my lap, bitch, foot to the floor
Here we go, here we go, stop at the liquor store ("Fall back")
Geah, real hood life on the daily
Good day then the strap's on safety
One time on the prowl with the profile
Low-key with the floss, loc, that's how
Money ain't a thang, stay hood on the whole G
Niggas on the mic, bitch hittin' the flow, geah
Can it all be simple?
I do it for the West, neighborhood, and kinfolk
I been spoke that
West all day where them gangstas at
Geah

[Hook: Eazy E ]
G-gettin' higher than a muthafucka

Higher than a muthafucka
Know what's up

G-gettin' higher than a muthafucka
Niggas know what's up
I'm that gangsta gangsta, is that what they're still yellin'
Higher than a muthafucka

G-gettin' higher
Gettin' high
