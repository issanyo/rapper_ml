[Intro: Daz & (Kurupt)]
I see you talking but make me a believer, girl
(Man, look at that bitch)
Look at her
(Take it bitch, take it)
Take it in the mouth
(Take this dick)

[Chorus: Daz Dillinger]
Make me a believer, girl (make me a believer, girl)
Show me what you all about (show me, show me, show me)
Seeing is believing, girl (seeing is believing, girl)
No doubt, no doubt
Make me a believer, girl (make me a believer, girl)
Show me what you all about (Show me, show me, show me)
Seeing is believing, girl
No doubt, no doubt (no doubt)

[Verse 1: Daz Dillinger]
Valet pulled up my 600
I asked baby girl, 'Is your girlfriend coming?’
200 miles, girl, Daz, he be gunnin'
I'm at my condo and I’m ready for some fuckin'
Pop me a pill and have me a blast
And all the girls say they wanna fuck you, Daz
If I pop me a pill then the panties drop (drop 'em)
And all of a sudden, baby girl just coughed
From smoking a blunt and she making it cum
Now tell me, is this what you want?
Can you give it to me, girl? I've been waiting to cum
Girl, all day night and all day long
Girl, no stress, tell me what you want
And I'll tell you everything I want (pussy)
Jump in the bed, give me some head
Fuck it, girl, give me some pussy instead
Redbone, so the pussy is red
See, it's the bomb, and that's all I said
Come on

[Chorus: Daz Dillinger]
Make me a believer, girl (make me a believer, girl)
Show me what you all about (show me, show me, show me)
Seeing is believing, girl (seeing is believing, girl)
No doubt, no doubt (no doubt)
Make me a believer, girl (make me a believer, girl)
Show me what you all about (show me, show me, show me)
Seeing is believing, girl (seeing is believing, girl)
No doubt, no doubt (no doubt)
Come on

[Verse 2]
[Daz Dillinger]
She was freaky, brought my mans this sexy little thing, she was classy
Drinking my drink at the bar
She was thick as a muthafucka and then she asked me (you drunk?)
Am I coming over later on to beat it unlike the night before
(you know I'ma beat that pussy up, girl)
And what she wanna do is fuck a nigga and smoke up a nigga’s dro
See, we out of the club (yeah, we out the club now)
Girl, give me a hug
I’m really feeling your butt
I wanna know what's up, girl
Tell me is, (who’s that right there), this your friend?
I've seen her before, and I'll see her again, oh

[Kurupt]
Little mama, you can do what you wanna do
I wanna know about the different things you into
I wanna know if you like it fast or like it slow
Is the way we gon' go and get it crackin’, ho?
I'm a survivor, I'm just G'd
I don't know no other way I should be besides me
I look at it like this, I gotta let you know
I got a lotta something to give you if you just let it go
I seen your friends looking
I'm dippin' in the bucket, rollin' down the streets in my '64 Chevy
Got homies all around me in the '64 Chevy (Dogg Pound)
This how we do it in the DPG
Kurupt, and Dat Nigga D-A-Z (you know)
I wanna see you in your pink panties
I wanna show you how it is to be G'd
I'ma show you what you need to see, what you gon' show me?
Ass, pussy, tits, lips
You and friend licking on this dick, which is it?

[Chorus: Daz Dillinger]
Make me a believer, girl (make me a believer, girl)
Show me what you all about (show me, show me, show me)
Seeing is believing, girl (seeing is believing, girl)
No doubt, no doubt (no doubt)
Make me a believer, girl (make me a believer, girl)
Show me what you all about (show me, show me, show me)
Seeing is believing, girl
No doubt, no doubt (no doubt)

[Outro: Daz]
Yeah, I like that
Just come a little closer, girl, put the head in your mouth
Ooh shit, yeah
Fuck sucking the dick, just suck the vein, you know'm'sayin'
You know the vein right there on my dick, right there
You know'm'sayin'
I'ma bust a nut all over your nose, your face, your ears
Everything, girl
Oh shit, my pager going off
I got to go, I'll see ya, holla at'cha boy, bitch
