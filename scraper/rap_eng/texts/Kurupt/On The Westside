Verse 1 [Daz Dillinger]

Yeah, ridin' down the street, smoke out the sunroof
Pocket full of loot, see I ain't afraid to shoot
Got my khaki suit on, I keep it so original
To fit in with them bloods and crips and straight criminals
Kurupt my n**a, Kokane ridin' with him
Bounce and ride to this Cali a**s rhythm
Set your EQ's adjust your amps
Ya know chillin' with your girl yeah adjust ya tramp
Tell her that i'm in town for just one night (night)
So stop b*****n' b***h get it right
See I'm a Dogg Pound gangsta, it explains itself
Ask ya homie who cocked, when did he need some help
See I ain't for the b.s, the party straight frizesh
Take it back to the 80's, I'm cold straight
What do you got left? Tha n**a called Daz
Mr Dillinger willin' to gettin' off in yo a**s

Chorus [Kokane]

Out on the westside, this is how we ride
When I get my gangsta boogie on, I smoke like Cheech and Chong
On the westside, this is how we ride
Where the girls be so damn fine, we keep it bangin' all the time

Verse 2 [Kurupt]

West West, young Eliot Ness
Ride up Ride up on a n**a nest
Write it on the walls, or ink it ya chest
Wicked westside malibu ss
Posted like a champ on the corner, we'll corner ya
Bust ambulance, coroner warrior
California Dreams
B*** s**t's nothin' homie
Talkin' that s**t tryna run up on me
You might get hit, thinkin' you won't get touched
F**n' around with us thinkin you won't get bussed on n***a
Hold your horses or get ya horse took
Perfect shot, west rider, dumpin' don't look
Inhale endo, only hit kush
Daz and Kurupt is the line I push
Kokane game cold a hundred below
Legendary westcoast gangsta flow

Chorus [Kokane]

Out on the westside, this is how we ride
When I get my gangsta boogie on, I smoke like Cheech and Chong
On the westside, this is how we ride
Where the girls be so damn fine, we keep it bangin' all the time
