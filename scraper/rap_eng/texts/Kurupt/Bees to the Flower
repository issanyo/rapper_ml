[Verse 1]
I'm made of lean, I'm made of rock, later jean make it work its not impossible
To make it twerk, do it first; lift off your shirt and your skirt
Just do it till your backbone hurts
If the most of ya’ll just came in well kill me a Wu tang, let it hang do your thang
Charcoal through my body and soul and its swangs off the chain, explosive
Propane hot sa a tay, octagon 8 side freight train, just pass it then hit it
Just do it, and get with it

[Chorus]
Imma tell you how I get sick with it I just trap haters like bees to the flower
Like a flower to the honey, cuz we still gettin money
Chuck up two fingers like the Playboy bunny
Hot like Cali asphalt when its sunny, we attract the ladies like the bees to the flower
Like the flower to the honey cuz we still gettin money
Chuck up two fingers like the Playboy bunny
Hot like Cali asphalt when its sunny

[Verse 2]
And you don't wanna stop
Cuz I make your whole body rock, I limp I flip, my grip is sick
I hit I sit, get up in there, buggalo shrimp Im a jump the gimp
The ladies simply can't get enough wimp, I walk in two step
Two step you step
He step she step, they step who step ?
Who's the tightest, I had me  this piece of work off our verbitis
Thick and righteous sexist-itis, cash for fruit the work recruit
I do what I do, I do it to you, any time any place
Wipe the floor to the basement
Cuz dj quicks in the building, no replacement
The way you work your body’s like you had a grudge on my tongue
The lipstick smudged

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Yea you now rocking with the best, Los Angeles Leakers man sour milk, just incredible
The big homie Kurupt, 420 the prequel to Streetlights Mixtape!  we doin it big man
Big shoutout to pentagon records ( the Los Angeles leakers)
