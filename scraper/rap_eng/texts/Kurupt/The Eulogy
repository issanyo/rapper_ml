Uhh, yeah
Take ya on a ride?

[Verse 1: CPO aka Boss Hogg]

Sippin' yak, I laxin' in Chronic fog
Flashbackin' on days of me and my Doggs
See the shit went foul, when it was over
But Yet and Still
Started out, Fools 4Real
Now this of course was back when we sorta lacked ends
Wasn't no paper available to fold
And I mean this broke shit was gettin' old
Cuz we was in need to be clockin' dollars
And we was in need to clock'um Now
Unh, deedee mow
Situation became drastic and so therefore
We chose to impose, some of those criminalistic tactics
And low and behold, well I be goddamned
If the stack didn't increase ten-motherfuckin-fold
Much to clever to go low again cuz we was driven
To stay up on top of thangs, loving the life we livin'
Strictly bidness, we was in this to win it all
Didn't give a fuck if no others didn't love us, me and my Doggs

[Hook x2: Kurupt]

Now this is how it's done like one two three
Different motherfuckers served tryna step to a G
I only got love for me and my Doggs
Slip Capone on a mission with that nigga Boss Hogg

[Verse 2: Slip Capone]

On a mission dippin' down Imperial
The name's Capone but first let me unfold the scenario (yeah)
Creepin', holdin' one winter weekend
In a BMW, there they go, I see them (who?)
Them fools that crossed me when I first started off
With the kingpin Kurupt and a G named Boss Hogg
But now I got a stack of Columbian crack
I gots to cook it in seven so a nigga can make his ends back
Prepared to murder if I have to and I had to
So I blasted the two in front and got the last few
No one escapes as Capone demonstrates power
And regulates the Westside's weed and white powder
Separates the boys from the men, ya see who's your true friend
And who ain't when you begin stackin' ends
That's why I never love no one but myself
And ain't a nigga crossed me that lived to tell (BLAOW!)

[Hook x2: Kurupt]

[Verse 3: CPO]

Listen, now whosoever stepped would be (Shit outta luck wit)
See we, Two Uhh, BGz, who was, (Simply not to be fucked with)
Best to been on your guard
We was stalkin' the fuckin' boulevard, really lawd
But since it wasn't enough for the two-man crew
We did some debating and contemplating on parlaying product in the revenue
Thought about it a minute then we concluded
We'd be stupid as fuck not to get up in it
So we's like "Shit! We had to do it!"
Servin them cavi would make the cash flow
Just a little mo fluid
And so we gathered up the proper amounts
Bought us up a flock o' motherfuckin birds and me and my niggas set out
(To defeat the rest
Sowin shit the fuck up from the east to west)
Came up large in commodities
Niggas started recitin philosophies like 'Sure as the rain falls
Yes y'all niggas was born to be ballin'
Since they was swimmin' in Pop's balls
Then all of a sudden I started noticin decreasin my grip figures
And I'm like "What? Hold on, wait a minute"
Wassup nigga with the shortness of my green
He looked me in my face and said "Fuck, you think it mean"
And right before my eyes the partnership dissolved
I seen him like he was a ho, showed him no love at all
He reached for his Glock but I was quicker BLAOW!
Used to be my homie but you's a dead motherfucker now
I'm ashamed but I say fuck it, today I became the Boss Hogg
Cuz today I buried my Dogg

[Outro: Slip Capone]

Check it
This just a quick reminder to let all y'all motherfuckers know
There ain't no friends in this game
Especially when you're dealing with this half white and black hearted, cross
Eyed, curly haired motherfucker, know I'm sayin?
The name's Capone puttin' it down with big CPO Boss Hogg
For a second to let all y'all motherfuckers know that it's a cold world
Niggas gotta supply they own heat
We recognize, realize, and analyze that shit ya dig
Hahahahaha
