[Chorus]
No matter what, no matter why or when or where or why you try or how you try
You try to hide listen to your body talk
No matter what, no matter why or when or where or why you try or how you try
You try to hide listen to your body talk
No matter what you think of me what you think I should be where you think I should be
How you think I should be I’m just gonna sit here while I listen to your body talk

[Verse 1]
Make no mistakes I came to get it, I'm in it to win it if I start it I finish, you look so fresh replenished I hear it just listen to your body talk, just so intoxicating I stay making
That money how do you think I made it? rich infamous and famous I talk that gangsta language
I hear your body saying listen to your body talk
Everytime I see you I just wanna show you how I get out
I get out I sit down smoke out
I got my chucks and my dickies all out fly out gators I know you like em cuz of the things
That your body is saying you like to roll Maserati just the one she just the one for you Gotti
Soon as she stepped in the party I started reading her body I started reading her body
Soon as you stepped in the party I just I just

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
Talk to me know, you can show me how, I'm supposed to communicate in another town
In and out the crowd i'm in and out the town, dipping hitting switches like its 86 in this
Is just me reminiscing listen I’m trying get it out, trying explain the way I feel about you
Here and now
What you want Patron? you wanna smoke a zone? I wanna listen to your body talk
If you play your cards right we can make a bubble if you say its alright we can keep this all night caught up in a huddle take off like a shuttle while I listen to your body talk
Its hard to understand this is feeling like trouble I didn't plan this extra
Step up in the center circle blowing on the vine that's purple stroking on the vine that's purple me and all my homies work to get it get it you get with it ? i looking to get it I was born for business
I handle my business  I got the bitches cuz I listen to your body talk
Yea now talk to me now
I wanna Body talk
