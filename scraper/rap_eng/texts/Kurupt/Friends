This one right here Goes out to everybody And it doesn't matter who you are Cuz I know that everybody Has a friend

[N.I.N.A.]
What defines a friend The meaning where does it lie? In the mind In the money In the face In in the eyes  In the days and the nights Well what is a friend Do you love it and leave it Again and again?  Now our story begins Of two little friends You would've thought they were twins Would've thought they was kin Wouldn't think they can bend Cuz all the time they would spend For each other they'd fend For their friends till the end And their mothers know mothers Sisters know brothers Mothers know fathers Sons know their daughters Blood thicker than water  If one had 50 cents They'd both have a quarter It only makes sense That destined love was in order They grew up together From pre-K to high school Winters in the snow Summers in the pool He's an athlete She's an actress But hormones would lead them to the mattress

Chorus: But you are my friend (friend) Together through thick and thin (friend) Like it we were All the things that we've been through I put so much trust in you  Back then (friend) Now what kind of friend Could you have been

[N.I.N.A.]
Not furious just curious She saw himself fit Who better than a boy The girl grew up with How 'bout all the walks in the park On the phone all night Dreams like that she saw in plain sight To his friends he's urgin' The simple fact she's a virgin To her he'll be urgin' Sexually lets merge As you can see There's two different dreams Her thoughts are so pure  His low as the floor She's lookin' He's gawkin' Now walkin' and talkin' About a new stage and phase That they should embark in So it came to that night No dinner no candlelight The female exhales Somethin' doesn't feel right She said it polite Honey please not tonight He didn't get in it So he got real malignant He hit her It hurt Her breath got suspended Then he looked at his work  Not feelin' so splendid
Chorus

[N.I.N.A.]
Their meeting had ended Feelin' offended He went and attended A counselin' session Now life is a lesson Full of questions Why we drown down Rather than manifestin' Went to his friend Right from the beginnin' With tears in his eyes Said I apologize She much obliged Made amends Once again They're friends to the end Yeah it was true love again As transparent as lens As apparent as kin  What defines a friend Where does it lie In the mind In the money In the face In the eyes In the days and the nights What is a friend Do you love it and leave it Again and again  In the time In the sadness In the hurt In the pride It's the person dispersin' Through the hands of time

Chorus
