[Intro]
(I don't wanna have to fuck you up smokey!
Playin' with my money is like playin' with my emotions...)
Call me AV (G-Mix)
What up Joe ? What up Bugsy ?

[Hook : AV]
Let me tell you one thing about me
I'm a young nigga fresh up off the CPT
The only thing on my mind is getting rich
I go hard on a nigga and a bitch
Like run me my money, nigga run me my money
Bitch run me my money, like run me my money
Nigga run me my money, bitch run me my money

[Verse 1 : AV]
Nigga run my money, for this motherfuckin' remix
You know I had to do the G-Mix
Run my money, for this motherfuckin' remix
You know I had to do the G-Mix
I woke up this morning like I still gotta get it
So ever nigga bread like 15 minutes
I hate broke niggas, I hate broke bitches
I'm trynna be cool but theses niggas don't listen
You was supposed to pay me on the 1st that's the 10th
Now word around town is "they ain't seen him ever since"
We caught a nigga sleepin', now we wipin' off the prints
A nigga better pay me before a nigga pay his rent
Run me my money

[Verse 2 : OT Genasis]
You owe me a check, cut it up!
Better have my bread, nigga run it up
You won't answer my calls and you outta luck

Deebo I'm gettin' hit with these bricks nigga
All my niggas get money, we don't play
So don't fix your lip, no smoochie

On my money right now, I ain't playing games
And if send you to the store I want my fucking change
