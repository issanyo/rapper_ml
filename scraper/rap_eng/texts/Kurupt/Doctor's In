[Hook]
The doctor's in, the joint lights
I'm pushin' kush, takin' shit to new heights
My vision's blown, I'm having new sights
Man, fuck this world
True blood, but the truth bites

[Verse 1]
Stings like a slice, whenever they bring up the rice
You thinkin' twice, I'm on some mad shit
Like Old Spice
My stalker's in, and it's real life
See I'm a rolling stone, throwin' stones real nice
And glass houses, rockin' by the thousands
Sparkin' many ounces, as the beat bounces
I got winnin' in my blood, I'm a champion
People show me love 'cause I'm the highest in the pantheon
You say this can't be life, I say what's real is real
You can dream it, see it, taste it
Why you fuckin' waste it?
Grab the lick and paste it, while you searchin' for me
Check my inventory, history, and real glory
The weed had brought him luck, I'm from the bottom up
I take the haters, put a stompin' on those rotten fucks

[Hook]
The doctor's in, the joint lights
I'm pushin' kush, takin' shit to new heights
My vision's blown, I'm having new sights
Man, fuck this world
True blood, but the truth bites
The doctor's in, the joint lights
I'm pushin' kush, takin' shit to new heights
My vision's blown, I'm having new sights
Man, fuck this world
True blood, but the truth bites

[Verse 2]
I hit my dock, fill my script, then I dip
[?] then I twist
Gettin' drunk off a fifth
That's everyday shit, I go to the grave with
But as long as I'm alive Imma rise for that grave shift
And I came from the pavement to makin' that A list
My reefers stay lit and these niggas I came with
Is the same ones that always been down from the jump
Ain't talkin' 'bout speakers when there's pounds in the trunk
The truth bites, I'm just trying not let it leave a mark
I played my part, each verse I pierce like a work of art
Niggas actin' hard, no time for the back and forth
This world's gonna give me exactly what I've been asking for
I'm about to fuck it raw, with no Magnum on
And leave my kids to roam this earth, like a vagabond

[Hook]
The doctor's in, the joint lights
I'm pushin' kush, takin' shit to new heights
My vision's blown, I'm having new sights
Man, fuck this world
True blood, but the truth bites
The doctor's in, the joint lights
I'm pushin' kush, takin' shit to new heights
My vision's blown, I'm having new sights
Man, fuck this world
True blood, but the truth bites

[Verse 3]
Nigga the doctor's in, ready to plot revenge to catch your oxygen
Fuck with me that's the consequence
Shoulda followed your conscience bitch
I'm on a pedestal higher than B-Real off his ganja hits
I love to contradict
'cause a nigga too nice when I'm on my monster shit
No secret that I'm ready to kill, barely appealed but I'm barely [?]
Can't be concealed
Starving rappers into pieces and then they get left in the field
Except for this real, invest in this shield
Before you niggas try to step to the skill
I'm built as heavy as steel
Got all of you scared to me it's a definite thrill
Nuttin' you can tell me, ain't nobody who can help me
I'm a Nightmare on Elm Street, lifestyle's unhealthy
I pull a [?] to my phone take a selfie
Oh my god who the hell's he?
Oh shit that's me staring back in the mirror
Got a hit list full of wack MCs
So you better believe I get the package delivered
That's what happens to niggas, when they mess with a lunatic
Imma cause ruckus in mothafuckas, when I bust this tough shit
Homeboy you'll never get used to
This, keep yourself at a distance from me
I'm an embarrassing hooligan, finna fuck the game
Scored a couple of sperm cells inside so they rest in the uterus

[Hook]
The doctor's in, the joint lights
I'm pushin' kush, takin' shit to new heights
My vision's blown, I'm having new sights
Man, fuck this world
True blood, but the truth bites
The doctor's in, the joint lights
I'm pushin' kush, takin' shit to new heights
My vision's blown, I'm having new sights
Man, fuck this world
True blood, but the truth bites
