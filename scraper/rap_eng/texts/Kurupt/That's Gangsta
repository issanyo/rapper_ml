[Intro: Ras Kass]
Yeah ah ah Yeah Is ya with me
What up y'all forget me y'all love y'all don't love me no more it's all good
All are real roudy niggas all my real niggas ride with your boy one time

[Verse One: Ras Kass]
Lyrically I smoke who ever it may concern
Even wearing a twenty one milligram pack a nigga derm
Been broke before ain't nuttin new
But ain't nuttin ever new me not to say fuck you
So have my nuts not grew
I would still hang in the streets with little niggas who is to bang just to eat
Bang with the heat the water proof spit blazes
To give y'all niggas business like the yellow pages
Enter the dark ages, enter at spark stages, for what ever wages
Untill I am famous for resurrecting  archaic language
And saying same shit different toilet
See the game who talented (un uh), it's about who sound scaned it
And now them same clowns made at it (pimp game)
But go figure lyricsist of the year is a white boy
And greatest Author is a confused nigga

[Hook: Ras Kass]
And that's gangsta without bangin the set
Big nuts on deck ain't even hangin'em yet
See it's just some things they should never forget
Ain't no mother fucking west without a r-a-s
And that's gangsta without bangin the set
Big nuts on debt ain't even hangin'em yet
See it's just some things they should never forget
Ain't no mother fucking west without a r-a-s

[Verse Two: Ras Kass]
I was taught to rhyme undeniably and force niggas to think
So if you need to dance so fucking much then buy N'Sync
Starting a movement to move men
Motavational,millimeter mantra repeated and  me the monster
Me I be the aqua, "Waterproof" got a lot of truth
Spit slaughtered a lot of groups
Rhyming without a clue, not off without loot
Black out like Caligula just a nigga that
Clown with a sucidial groupie in the jacuzzi pullin my shorts down
Givin me underwater head 'til I nut and she drowned
How the fuck we sound (man rap is out of control I got to smoke son)
Yo homie bust me down
Took a pull of a new port and passed it back
Nuts hang like a had an elastic sack
Splash the gats if I find a classic clapse
Wanna know the reason why white people seem to laugh at blacks
Cause brothers in South Africa slaving to death in diamond mines
Meanwhile we spending every penny to overshine
Tell the next nigga he lesser cause he can't afford to buy ice from his opresser
So I ain't pulling out nines willing the homicide need of mine
Mean while George W. Bush got a war on crime
(*matrix sample*)
Introduction to the matrix
I say the shit you know is true but you wanna ignore metanor metaphor

[Hook: Ras Kass + Kurupt]
And that's gangsta without bangin the set
Big nuts on debt ain't even hangin'em yet
See it's just some things they should never forget
Ain't no mother fucking west without a r-a-s
And that's gangsta without bangin the set
Big nuts on debt ain't even hangin'em yet
See it's just some things they should never forget
Ain't no  west without kurupt with a r-a-s

Don't forget yeah big ass posted
