[Intro: Snoop Dogg]
I'ma call this nigga David Banner one time
See what's happenin' with this nigga
Ay Banner, it's Snoop Dogg, cuh
I need some gangsta shit for the DPGC album
Yeah, give me some of that Mississippi
Some of that jungle boogie, cuh, yeah
You know my folks from down there too, my nigga, so...
Yeah, give me some of that right there, cuh

[Kurupt]
Bitch...biatch...little hoodrat bitch, and your nigga

[Verse 1]
[Kurupt]
Bitch, if you got it, let me see it
I'll be coming through this evening
Once I hit it, then I'm leaving
Throw it up, DPGC'n
Things still what they worth — but is it really worth it?
Chippin', servin', swervin', nigga — now is it really worth it?
You know I've been thinking (what?) about if it's worth it
Clap like tambourines just to make sure the heat is working
Yeah, I socked your homeboy on purpose 'cause he deserve it
I'ma keep on bangin', watchin' unsolved murders

[Daz]
I come through beatin' down the block with 10 woofers and 10 idamps
You know and I know you ain't fuckin' with the cidamp
Fast lane, smoke an idounce
Candy paint on the 6-6, nigga, as a gangsta bidounce
Pimpin' like a muh'fuckin' trick
And this is how we do this bitch
You know I'm sick like the flu, I thought you knew it was detrimental
Especially when David B. is on the ih-ih-instrumental

[Chorus: David Banner]
She gon' shake (go shake), go walk (go walk)
Drop it down, girl, let me see it talk (see it talk)
She gon' shake (go shake), we gon' walk (go walk)
Drop it down, girl, let me see it talk (see it talk)
Go and get your money (fuck them fakin' ass hoes)
Go and get your money (fuck them fakin' ass hoes)
Go and get your money (fuck them fakin' ass hoes)
When you drop it on the ground, get your cash off the floor

[Verse 2]
[Daz]
It's time to get it, get it, get it, get it
Man, that's how we get up in it
David Banner on this beat, Tha Pound gotta spit it
We do 'em vicious, show internal and no remorse
Threw them bitch ass niggas off balance and off course
Striking with the venom, from khaki shorts to denim
Million faces, spend 'em, them AK's spin 'em
Yeah, it's the shit that we bounce, rock, skate
Too legit too quit, the paper's still high rate
Boom boom, I come through shaking the ground when I lay 'em down
We on a mission, muh'fucka, it's Tha Dogg Pound

[Kurupt]
I can chip the curb, I can roll the streets on D's
Bitch, I can do anything I damn well please
Boy, you better watch your bitch
Before you end up leaving the club without your bitch
I got a school piranha
And they ain't ate in I don't know how many days tomorrow
We in the strip club, we ain't doing too much
Drinking liquor and looking for some asses to touch
I put my locs on to see what I'm saying
To this dusty ass bitch kickin' back like she gaining

[Chorus: David Banner]
She gon' shake (go shake), go walk (go walk)
Drop it down, girl, let me see it talk (see it talk)
She gon' shake (go shake), we gon' walk (go walk)
Drop it down, girl, let me see it talk (see it talk)
Go and get your money (fuck them fakin' ass hoes)
Go and get your money (fuck them fakin' ass hoes)
Go and get your money (fuck them fakin' ass hoes)
When you drop it on the ground, get your cash off the floor

[Interlude: Daz]
See, you know that I know that I know now that you a bitch
You know that I know that I know now that you a hoe
You know that I know that I know now that you a bitch
You know that I know that I know now that you a hoe
You know that I know that I know now that you a bitch
You know that I know that I know now that you a hoe

[Verse 3: David Banner]
Bitch, I'm finger fuckin' this tool
Nine millimeter bustin' at you, and I'm screaming, nigga
Pull it, you got a gun, you better bust
Warfare means nothin' to us
And I"m screaming out 'What time is it?' like Jerome with a mirror
And a bullet in your hair will make a riot turn a pirouette
Ah, you in a pool in blood
That's what you get, nigga, for fuckin' with thugs
And I'm screaming, nigga, yeah
Uh-huh, I think I'm the shit
Buck it, roof, dog, fuckin' ya miss
As she's screaming out, 'What can a bitch do for a young nigga?'
Hit the stage, young hoe, bring a nigga six figures

[Chorus: David Banner]
She gon' shake (go shake), go walk (go walk)
Drop it down, girl, let me see it talk (see it talk)
She gon' shake (go shake), we gon' walk (go walk)
Drop it down, girl, let me see it talk (see it talk)
Go and get your money (fuck them fakin' ass hoes)
Go and get your money (fuck them fakin' ass hoes)
Go and get your money (fuck them fakin' ass hoes)
When you drop it on the ground, get your cash off the floor...
