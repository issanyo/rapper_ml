[Intro: Kurupt]
Kurupt Young Gotti
Man what's up Sapphire you know
I mean We gotta make it do what it do baby you dig
Keep it real smooth on em what's happening

[Verse 1: Teena Marie]
Excuse me baby, baby but you're so fine
I'm gone wrap you round me like a grapevine
I be Sapphire bag me by all means there's
Much more to me than the eyes can see
Afrocentric rhythms on my brain got
Teeth like diamonds eyes like hurricane
I'm Chocolate covered berries dipped in Chardon
Give you what you need and always keep it raw dog

[Hook: Teena]
Do your thing and make the choir girl sing
Turn a woman's head around
Turn a woman's head all the way around baby
Make me forget who I am and that I got a man
Got me saying aah well damn
Make me feel lost baby, when I'm found
Who does it belong to, baby whose is it
I'd drive across town through traffic to sip Malibu with you
Who does it belong to, oh Baby whose is it
There ain't no shame in my game tell the world baby I love you

[Verse 2: Teena]
Forgive me cussin' just at the time sweet T rolled a 60
Baby in a heartbeat
Dark town girls will always be my MO
West Coast ladies bout to hit you so low
I'm good company baby in a pinch
You'll always choose me ain't No split decision
Rumor has it I've done everything
The notorious lady to the T

[Hook: Teena]
Do your thing and make the church bells ring
Turn a woman's head around
Turn a woman's head all the way around baby
Make me forget who I am and that I got a man
Got me saying aah well damn
Make me feel lost baby, when I'm found
Who does it belong to, Baby whose is it
I'd write your name on my back in a tat if you'd ask me to
Who does it belong to, oh Baby whose is it
There ain't no shame in my game tell the world baby I love you

[Bridge: Teena]
Sexy when you put it on me baby with your rhythms
If you was a surgeon then you'd work me with precision
Got me goin' deep I think I'm having inner visions
Got me going crazy got me wondering how I'm livin'
Sexy when you put it on me baby with your rhythms
If you was a surgeon then you'd work me with precision
Got me goin' deep I think I'm having inner visions
Got me going crazy Got me going crazy

[Verse 3: Teena & Kurupt]
Yeah how you wanna do this flex baby bend like a reed in the wind
This where your fantasies end
I'll hit it outta the park and we'll be battin' 1000
Tongue box player with the souped up sounds and
I got the mix have you spinnin' your rims
You're lookin' for me to trim and now you're out on a limb
I got you hot wired sound fired fiending for some Teena
Blindfold you boy you'll think your kissin' Angelina
(Whose is it daddy)
Man who does it swing for
For who the bell tolls baby who does it ring for
(Whose is it daddy)
I'll pour myself over you
See I'm a make it do what it do what it do
(Whose is it daddy)
Whose gonna roll the seven
My call letters what boy for you HE-aven
(Whose is it daddy)
Who'll make you feel like a thug
You might as well face you're a sucker for love

[Outro: Teena & Kurupt]
Who does it belong to
Whose your daddy
Baby whose is it
Tell me bout it
I'd drive across town through traffic to sip Malibu with you
Who does it belong to
Whose your daddy whose your daddy
Baby whose is it
Whose is it daddy
There ain't no shame in my game tell the world baby I love you
Whose your daddy baby
Who does it belong to, baby whose is it
Whose is it daddy
I'd write your name on my back in a tat if you'd ask me to
Who does it belong to, oh baby whose is it
Whose is it daddy
I'd drive across town through traffic to whip my dookey stick on you
Who does it belong to
