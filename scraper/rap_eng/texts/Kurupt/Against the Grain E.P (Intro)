[Verse]
We’re for real my friends went all the way to Deathrow
Its either big money or no money
There was nothing to disconnect Mr Gotti from what happened , zilch
Back up fool
You’ll now ..see em no real Gangstas
I got him at gunpoint
Listen to me there are many more men who are experiencing the
Same injustice there's a revolution coming very soon
Yea rise ! Kurupt Young Gotti !
Welcome to the hoodzone nigga
Die nigga !
