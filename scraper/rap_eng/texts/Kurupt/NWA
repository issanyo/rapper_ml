[Intro: Ice Cube]
Gangsta, gangsta

[Verse 1: Miguel]
She just wanna have fun
She just want a wild nigga, wild nights
She just wanna fuck crazy
She just wanna fuck 'til she can't move no more
She don't wanna fall for me, she don't wanna fall for me
But it's too late
We should make you pay for this
We can make you pay for this

[Pre-Chorus: Miguel]
Have you walking with a gangsta lean
Got you walking with a gangsta lean
Give it to me babe
Now you walking with a gangsta lean
Got you walking with a gangsta lean
Give it to me babe

[Chorus: Miguel]
This is something for my OGs
Little mama, mami wanna throw me way back
She did it 'til she OD
She just wanna ride with a, a NWA
Something for my OGs
Little mama, mami wanna throw me take that
She did it 'til she OD
Smoke a lil' something if you're, a NWA
NWA
NWA

[Verse 2: Kurupt]
I'm a nigga with a attitude
A nigga want ass, you got that
Won't you let a nigga rub on that fat cat
She just want a real nigga that'll get that
Won't you let a Dogghouse nigga hit that
After after hours, little mama with that
Her skin so silky
Body  from a movie like she plaster on a silk screen
Sit back, posted like a poster
Look into the left and see your body's all mocha
Molly and coke I ain't a loca, I seen her, she loves hyenas
Especially hyenas with money like Lee Iacocca with an attitude
She just wanna have fun and I can give her what she want
I can make her pay for that
She just wanna have fun and I can give her what she want
I should make her pay for that

[Chorus: Miguel]
This is something for my OGs
Little mama, mami wanna throw me way back
She did it 'til she OD
She just wanna ride with a, a NWA
Something for my OGs
Little mama, mami wanna throw me take that

[Ice Cube]
[Gangsta, gangsta]

[Bridge: Miguel]
Puro Angelino, besando a mar, y son pocos, no tocas
We're calm but we're crazy for real
Puro Angelino, besando a mar, y son pocos, no tocas
We're calm but we're crazy for real

[Chorus: Miguel]
This is something for my OGs
Little mama, mami wanna throw me way back
She did it 'til she OD
She just wanna ride with a, a NWA
Something for my OGs
Little mama, mami wanna throw me take that
She did it 'til she OD
Smoke a little something if you're, a NWA
Smoke a little something if you're, a NWA
She just wanna ride with a, a NWA

[Outro: Miguel]
Puro Angelino, besando a mar (NWA)
Y son pocos, no tocas
We're calm but we're crazy
Puro Angelino, besando a mar, y son pocos, no tocas
We're calm but we're crazy for real
