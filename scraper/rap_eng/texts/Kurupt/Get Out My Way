[Intro]
Hello, hello, hello
D-O-G-G C-H-I-T
Daz and Kurupt, Tha Dogg Pound, trick...

[Verse 1: Kurupt]
We open, nigga, trip and we smokin' niggas
Slappin' and soakin' niggas, Lee Iacoca, nigga
All for the coca, nigga, servin' and swervin'
Purgin', and Daz start choking niggas all outside of Kroger, nigga
Cock it and roast a nigga
I'm outside of the club waiting 'til it's all over
Figures
Is flying all over the water, all over the water
And both the triggers is ready for squeezin'
Nigga, kick that cheese in, bodies all spread out
Laid down all over the ground, nobody's leaving
Breathing, showin' niggas what I believe in
Get the fuck out my face unless you talking 'bout bread, nigga
Get what I said, yeah, move or get beat the fuck up

[Chorus: Daz & Kurupt]
Get out my way, what you gon' do?
I'ma bomb on your homie, I'ma bomb on you
Get out my way, what the fuck you gon' do?
I'ma smash on this undercover busta nigga too
Get out my way, what you gon' do?
I got five in the chamber, nigga, ready to shoot through
Get out my way, what you gon' do? (What?)
What you gon' do? (What?)
What you gon' do?

[Verse 2: Daz]
It's getting crowded in this bitch, I need some elbow room
Elbow 'em, make 'em land on their tailbone
Use my muscle, tune haters out, use my hustle
Instructed to listen, watch y'all, do my puzzle
Piece it to the stool, bomb leaves, got a couple
Heaters, and I use my tool not tuck 'em
Reach 'em only when it's necessary
Cherry poppin' your woman in the Chevy, aw fuck it
Forget y'all bustas like to cuff 'em, keep 'em, I'm a pimp
I don't love 'em, I teach 'em to make room (haters what you gon' do?)
Can't move, duct taped, strapped down
Screaming my people coming with them gats out, screaming out...

[Chorus: Daz & Kurupt]
Get out my way, what you gon' do?
I'ma bomb on your homie, I'ma bomb on you
Get out my way, what the fuck you gon' do?
I'ma smash on this undercover busta nigga too
Get out my way, what you gon' do?
I got five in the chamber, nigga, ready to shoot through
Get out my way, what you gon' do? (What?)
What you gon' do? (What?)
What you gon' do?

[Interlude: Daz]
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey

[Verse 3]
[Kurupt]
Move muh'fucka, give me some space
Before I punch ya ass in the muthafuckin' face
Bitch ass nigga, mark ass nigga
I got these hollow tips in your hood, names all on it
Rollin' on chrome, follow niggas home
Hennessy, Patron, dookie brown Brougham
Body to body chippin', Dogg Pound Crippin'
Roll, ride and tippin', side to side and clippin'

[Daz]
Yes, you run, nigga, better vacate
Space right here, hater-free, hate me
From a far distance, y'all niggas are ridiculous
Thinking y'all can stick with the same thing, yeah, we taking, yeah
Plus I keep the ganja leaf up in the air, player
I ain't playin', wit'cha, I don't care, nigga, anywhere
Plus, inconsistent, bust up at a distance
Nigga, this is for my thug niggas...
Come on...

[Chorus: Daz & Kurupt]
Get out my way, what you gon' do?
I'ma bomb on your homie, I'ma bomb on you
Get out my way, what the fuck you gon' do?
I'ma smash on this undercover busta nigga too
Get out my way, what you gon' do?
I got five in the chamber, nigga, ready to shoot through
Get out my way, what you gon' do? (What?)
What you gon' do? (What?)
What you gon' do?

[Outro: Daz]
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey...
