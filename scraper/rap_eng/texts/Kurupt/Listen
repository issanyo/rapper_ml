[Intro]
You know niggas always wanna be right
Do anything to tight us on the mike
Get yo fuck, man
Who cares to disagree? Pretendents
Wait, wait, man I got it I got it, look

[Verse: Kurupt]
Extending this strenuous verbal in a histamine
Who gets the beam, who tries to wise with broken legs
Hip the thighs, rip to shreds
Victim dies, clip them sliped
God’s with boa constrictor
Chip, to miss the motherfucking lyrics
Volcanic, any second explode panic
Attacking niggas, slapping niggas
Put em in the trunk and kidnap them niggas
I got 5 balls aimed that way
Any day to die and I’ma die today
Before I let you take what’s mines
Take up time, motherfucker, I’ma die today
Before I let you take up mines, listen to me
Clap the 9 and clap your spine
Before I let you take my mine
The penalty for poetry perjury is indiseration
Columbine through the mike line indignation
Piranha fish is poisonous presentation
White bitches that can sniff up glaciers
Rhymes to move continents can lift up Asia
Put down the compound, rip up stages
Pages, a pyro burnt up gauges
But, it’s a must, any mic can handle me
Get used for extermination
Crocodile skin, termicide rhymes
Penitentiary mind man a young benabin
Hawkenstein double o grind
7 mac 11’s at the same damn time
Tell the 5th brigade, suicide train
Got it Kurt Cobain, blowing out my brain
Nothing seemed safe, heaven’s out of range, listen
