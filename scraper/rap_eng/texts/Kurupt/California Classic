[Intro]
This is radio station 2k point G
On your radio dial
And we are here live
With the Diirty OGz
This record here is Kokane
Featuring the Diirty OGz
Right

[Hook: Kokane]
There's no place
No place like home
Where the gangstas roam
And roll on chrome
It's just that Californian classic
We smoking good
We keeps it hood
Just like a real nigga should
I wish you would
It's just that Californian Classic

[Verse 1: Tha Chill]
Kokane this special
This a toast from the boogie
Gangsta's don't dance
Lil' gangbang rookie
I get it from the truth in the booth like Tookie
I'm so california on ya'
Blowing on that ganja
And we tipping wth them T tops
All black everything in my I-Roc
Huh, I got that scoop it
Get higher than a mink coat
Baby here hoop this
So gangsta the homies gone loot this
Iller, killer, cali do it Eazy we Ruthless
The chill got em' on the steering wheel
Skipping past the palm trees
90 degrees in something classic
Me and koka' keep it lit
We ain't tripping of shit
They can suck my dick
Cause this classic
Coming straight from the left side
Westside, best side , fire it up, let's ride

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Weazel Loc]
Aw shit somebody call the coroner
There was a murder last night on the corner
Point blank range now cuz is a gonna
That's how it is on the west side of Pomona
It's the rider named Weaz
In the california breeze
On a mission checking traps cause i gotta get cheese
Diirty OG'z posted up at the hang out
Rag tray front and back is what they made me bring out
If gun shoots rang out
We the ones that doing it
Ain't no motherfucking way street punks is ruin it
I'm a keep it gangsta like these other niggas couldn't
And ride for the west when these other niggas wouldn't

[Verse 3: Big Tray Deee]
CA
We stay
Doin' it the G way
Dippin' in the trizzay
Swervin' while the beat play
Fresh new fitted
The jewels all glistening
Stash spot pistol, should a fool come trippin'
Knockin' bad bitches, clock fat chippers
Keep some sticky twisted up in my swisher
The sweet life, street life, straight from the East Side
Started from a G-ride, now I take G-flights
Born gangsta, hustlin' and bangin'
State mandate that the busters get mangled
Bust in new gators and fuckin' off paper
Building with real niggas duckin' all haters

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Kurupt]
Dangerous
The house will make it as loud as thunderstorm
As quiet as church mouses
2 to the motherfucking chin
Get it in
Half of the party is rolled up before it ends
Classic
Ninety eighty fend'
Tend to get in
Domino mutherfucker
She'll drop her drawers
Will drop his jaws
Ass whoopin's
I work like painted walls, nigga
The firing works
Hustling in the alley checking iron works
This is just a childhood of a hood nigga
All grown up real still good nigga
Now I got 20,000 doller suits
Looking at these niggas like what it do
Maybe I should slap the shit outta you
You and your homeboy too
Where you from nigga

[Outro]
California
We finna' put in work
Check traps and make snaps
