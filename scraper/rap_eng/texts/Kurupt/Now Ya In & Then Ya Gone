Now ya in and then ya gone
See, this is that type of bullshit you’re on
Playing a game of chess, then I am the pawn
Every night put me down, I wake up in the morning
Refresh my mind, get back on the line
I gotta get stacks and get back on the grind
I walk in the club, they always showing me love
It’s that stupid compartment, we just don’t give a fuck

[Verse: Kurupt]
Hey, yo, I got a G boy stance with a G boy attitude
Hey, yo, fuck your gratitude
For some is different, my nigga, see, I ain’t mad at you
I’m planning, I’m plotting, I get right back at you
What up big homie? All respect due
I’m having the same things, I want respect, too
Money and power and pushing no cowards
Just see I clock it every second, I spin it every hour
My grind is magnificent, crafted by the best
Can’t speak for the rest, come give it a test
Every day till 25 life chance see that I’m taking
These bitches that I’m breaking, all the money that I’m making
Check mate, I live my life in God’s faith
You disrespect this, you got to deal with the mistakes
Once you’re in a gang, yeah, you in it for life
So you’re a Dogg Pound gangster, come and get you some stripes

[Hook]
Now ya in and then ya gone
See, this is that type of bullshit you’re on
Playing a game of chess, then I am the pawn
Every night put me down, I wake up in the morning
Refresh my mind, get back on the line
I gotta get stacks and get back on the grind
I walk in the club, they always showing me love
It’s that stupid compartment, we just don’t give a fuck

[Verse: Tha Dogg Pound]
Now a party ain’t a party if the homies ain’t invited
If you got the bong won’t you come over and light it?
I’m on a different plane, I’m flyer than a pilot
Midas, I got that touch, there’s no denial
Money and the power will get me all that I want
A trip to Brazil, couple M worth of ‘blunts
And niggas like you get smashed and bundle up
Money, envelope folded, they gunned ‘em up
I once had a girl that liked to play with my mind
She’d always tell me she love me and then pay me no mind
I couldn’t help it, she always stayed on my mind
Until I found another love to say on the grind
I had another lady friend that loved to hustle
Vigorous, innocent, but she was nothing but trouble
The first thing she did to put me up in the bubble
Sneaking in my stash

[Hook]
Now ya in and then ya gone
See, this is that type of bullshit you’re on
Playing a game of chess, then I am the pawn
Every night put me down, I wake up in the morning
Refresh my mind, get back on the line
I gotta get stacks and get back on the grind
I walk in the club, they always showing me love
It’s that stupid compartment, we just don’t give a fuck..!
