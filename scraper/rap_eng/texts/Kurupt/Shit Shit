[Hook: N.No]
I lay a nigga down right now
How I'm feelin' in my mind right now x2
Hop out and do my shit, shit
Niggas know I do my shit, shit
Rain or snow, I do my shit, shit
Bitch, I do my shit, shit
For my folks I do my shit, shit
For my Locs I do my shit, shit
Bitch, I do my shit, shit
Run up on and do my shit, shit
Catchin' zombies do my shit, shit
Bitch, I do my shit, shit
Niggas know I do my shit, shit x2

[Verse 1: N.No]
Nigga tell me how you love that?
Graduated from where the floods at
Now I'm where the crips and the bloods at
How you love that?
We put the stash by the rug mats
That's where the tools and the buds at
How you love that?
You know I do it for the troops nigga
From Cedar ave down to Spruce nigga
How you love that?
Fuck a past nigga, SQ
They yellin' mayday when we come through

[Hook]

[Verse 2: B.CaRR]
It ain't the same thing you used to
Live to more money and more juice
Feelin' like Pac on the snow roof
Finna do my shit shit, MAC-10 with the hollow tip tips
Bitch you better run, jump and skip skip
Tell me how you love that?
I'm posted up where the bloods at
On the [?] selling hunna' sacks
Tell me how you love that?
My whole life I've been a rider nigga
Tonight somebody finna die my nigga

[Hook]

[Break: Kurupt]
Man, fuck these niggas, nigga
We bangin' on all you bust ass niggas, every time
West coast or nothin' my nigga
You know what it is
Gotti

[Verse 3: Kurupt]
Coastal Costra Nostra postal
Pivoted on social hoods sentinel
Send ten of you to the ocean, rock
Seventeen years old I shot my first gun
I'm the last to leave, you first to run
Dispersed the sonnet, first to one, fire
The building come down when the turf stomped
South central bound, clowns get mops
I'm off the wall, my nigga you billy jean
Gang-banged just so you don't get mopped up (up) in these streets
Ran all like turf in cleats off get when you need that hit
Just west coast on down-a-this, don't stress you in the west
Where we have the best weed, come and get these Hit-Boy beats
Bounce, and coast

[Outro: Peej]
If a nigga got a problem, I gotta lot of options
So you, know, yeah
I don't ride without one, and you don't squat without them
[?] yeah
I'm out here like which one of y'all niggas, which one of y'all niggas, which one
I'm like fuck all of these niggas, fuck all of these niggas, how come
If a nigga got a problem, I gotta lot of options
So you, know, yeah
I'm out here like which one of y'all niggas, which one of y'all niggas, which one (x2)
If a nigga got a problem, I gotta lot of options
So you, know, yeah
