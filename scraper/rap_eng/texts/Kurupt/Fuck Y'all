[Hook]
When my shit drop I get all the love
But fuck y'all
When my shit come out it be bumpin' in all the clubs
So fuck y'all
If you ever thought that you was goin' hard as us
Fuck y'all
Fuck y'all
Fuck y'all
And it's still fuck the police too

[Verse 1]
You can do some corny shit and get paid
You can bite a nigga swag and get laid
You can blow up or leave a shit stain
Shit that I been goin' through since 5th grade
I, been smokin' weed, I been drinkin' beer
I ain't worked a real job in 6 years
My time is money
My time is fuckin' money
So before we get started get that get that shit clear
Man niggas hardly home gotta call us on the plane
Hear em diss the Div man them niggas talkin' Dame
Sherm head out ya brain I can put you out ya pain
Lift a nigga off his feet
Tell me What you know about that Blaine?
Look, man I'm walkin' Pac Div
Talkin' like I'm Pac Div
When I'm out in traffic bitches hunt me like I'm Pac Div
Mack 10 fo' life
Bengal I got old stripes
No hype, we ain't matchin' numbers that's our old price
Cash, check, yeah scrilla
Got the strength of 10 niggas
Yeah I'm cool but them niggas is some weird pillars
In the hood to the white boys with Quiksilver
Out the park with the shit I think I'm Prince Fielder
When you're raw you push that thing to the limit
We just finna count profit I'm a swim in a minute
I don't speed at the limit, move how I wanna move
Knuckle head nigga I'm a do what I wanna do

[Hook]
When my shit drop I get all the love
But fuck y'all

Fuck y'all
And it's still fuck the police too
Fuck the police too
Fuck the police too
Fuck the police too
Fuck the police too

[Verse 2]
Fuck em, we dodge em and we duck em
Put your hand out they gon' cuff em
Guns drawn they gon' buck em dog
No discussion, they kick the door and they rush in
They heat is cocked and they bustin'
You feed em it really means nothin' dog
These niggas awfully and lawful
They breakin' inside yo' crib
It just means they probably gon' rob you
They actin' holy in public but far from part the Apostle
Abusin' the constituion and quit to carve up the Gospel dog
The laws (?) supposed to be talkin' bout bitches and weed
Money and bling those sort of things ya know?
Yeah it seems to be what's in
But when have you ever known us to do what's seems to be the trend?
I keep beastin' with the pen
Won't sell my soul to the media for spins
In this cheesy fuckin' biz I'm out

[Hook]
When my shit drop I get all the love
But fuck y'all
When my shit come out it be bumpin' in all the clubs
So fuck y'all
If you ever thought that you was goin' hard as us
Fuck y'all
Fuck y'all
Fuck y'all
And it's still fuck the police too
Fuck the police too
Fuck the police too
Fuck the police too
Fuck the police too

[Verse 3-Kurupt]
You know that this is just to give the nigga we was born to ball
Fuck em, you didn't know that we was on to y'all
It's hard to get along in this motherfuckin' dead zone
Picture frame, Instagram, camera phone
Sarah Palin, bitch white politic
Diplomatic immunity on the dick
Corporate in the shit, been the shit, venomous
Innocent, opposite, in to get it, all of it
Into gettin' all of it
All about my business
Me and Pac insidious
You know Gotti's hideous
Young and the intelligent to motherfuckin' idiots
Live it and experience
Y'all be on some silly shit
Fuck em, fuck em

[Hook]
When my shit drop I get all the love
But fuck y'all
When my shit come out it be bumpin' in all the clubs
So fuck y'all
If you ever thought that you was goin' hard as us
Fuck y'all
Fuck y'all
Fuck y'all
And it's still fuck the police too
Fuck the police too
Fuck the police too
Fuck the police too
Fuck the police too
