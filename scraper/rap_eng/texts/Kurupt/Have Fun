Yeah, uh, hahaha, B-Boy shit, we don't stop, stop
Have fun, have fun, ha-ha-have fun
That's how we get it down
Likwit crew sound

You might find me wylin out at your local club
Or hangin out at your local pub
Stealin bottles from the bar, sendin bitches as decoys
Me and my Alkaholik Likwit B-Boys
Staggerin, pissy drunk, gettin that freaks
Rush the DJ, make him play some of my beats
Ladies stop and stare
They see Swift over there
But my girls in here
So I quickly disappear (where)
Spanish night at the Casa
Dancin with freaky mammies on X, high and drunk tryna salsa
Pop my collar, twist my change it's the ? ?
Kick a little game and add your name to my roster
Out to the next jam
Let the bouncer know exactly who I am
This is Likwit fam (better believe it)
All out of dress code, no I.D's
And we all gettin in for free

We just wanna have fun, have fun, have fun
Have fun, have fun, have fun, have fun
We just wanna have fun, have fun, have fun
Have fun, have fun, have fun, have fun
We just wanna have

Real wit that's what I'm about
I like real wit fun that's what I'm about
I like real wit fun that's what I'm about
I like real wit fun that's what I'm about
All I really need coke, brew and weed
Till I'm nice and keyed, oh yes indeed
And some fine chickadees, yeah gots my steeze
I asked the homie out ? and he quickly agreed
Hey girl, you're coming over right after my show
You and me on the floor buttnaked like D'Angelo
Now that's fun, and that's fun
We fresh off the bottle of the Applety rum
Goin shoppin wit you, nah that ain't fun
Eatin dinner wit your parents, nah that ain't fun
Playin with the two's, yeah that's fun
But I really ain't into ballets
You know how I like to have fun
Please be believin
I have the most fun with my ? in your ?
Till you stop breathin, chokin
I be provokin B-Boys to act fool from Diago to Oakland
So what you gon' do, what you gon' do
When my Likwit crew come ?? all over you

Have fun, have fun, have fun, have fun
Have fun, have fun, have fun
We just wanna have fun, have fun, have fun, have fun
Have-have-have fun
We just wanna have fun, have fun, have fun, have fun
Have-have-have fun
We just wanna have fun, have fun, have fun, have fun
Have-have-have fun
Have fun, have fun, have fun, have-have-have fun
We just wanna have, I just wanna have, yeah
Make em bounce to it
And I just wanna have, have

Yeah, it's time to hit the spot, it's a quarter to six
Ain't nuttin on my mind but pussy and chicks
Harlem bitches thinkin bout it, chips in the dicks
Strip clubs, peanuts
A lotta extra liquor, port and the pina colada
House parties after hours come to my spot
Grab all your hands, sip tequila and peach schnapps
Girl y'all can have a bar and we can have fun
Wanna have two, one for her, one for you
Ain't nuthin like it, just can't you see
And I love it when the ladies love each other for me
And have fun, bitch

Ay yo, ? Tash we havin fun
I live my life on the run
I'm running from these sprung bitches with a knife and a gun
The ho's we love em where I'm from
I live in ocho uno ocho
We pull em to the curb and put the cocks up in the choko
Smoke so much weed you might think clouds are formin
But we straight up Alkaholiks, straight up live performers
Baggin ?, all yours is stuck on minimal
Ya fools can't get nowhere cos y'all be runnin with them criminals
We have fun from sun up to sun set
We scoober divin ?, all that shit we ain't done yet
We just ? off weed, who the fuck wanna get it
Cos life ain't really life if you ain't havin fun wit it

Have fun, have fun, have fun, have fun, have-have-have fun
We just wanna have fun, have fun, have fun, have fun
Have-have-have fun
