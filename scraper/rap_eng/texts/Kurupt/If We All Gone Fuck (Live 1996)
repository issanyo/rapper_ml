[Intro]
How y'all feel out there?

[Audience Cheering]

It's a whole lotta pretty motherfucking ladies in the crowd tonight
But you know what?
There's so many women and so less niggas
Let's all fuck

Get up to get down
Uh!
Get busy, don't stop
Get busy, don't stop
Get busy, don't stop
Get busy, don't stop
Get busy, don't stop
Hey no disrespect to the ladies, but

[Kurupt]
I seen this hoe, yeh whats up bitch
A nigga never knew that he could fuck so quick
Looney then a motherfucka, its the d-o-g's
The K-u-r-u-p-t and the D-a-z

[2Pac]
Well uh..you know how we treat hoe's (Fuck Em)
Slam em on they back like dominoes!
Oh how I don't love a bitch, while a bitch steal they shit
Thats the reason why your main hoe ate my dick!

[Kurupt]
Well she ate yo dick (Uh huh)
She ate mines too, now what the fuck can me & D-A-Z pursue

[2Pac]
We served the ho's gin and juice
And we blazed up the sac, Relax and chill
The bitch didn't know how to act!

[Kurupt]
Now they all fucked up & theres a knock on the door

[Daz]
Who is it?

[Kurupt]
It's my nigga Snoop Dogg wit a flock of hoes

[Snoop Dogg]
