I don't know, you know
Since I was young, I've been, you know
Tryina do things different, you know
Live my life a little bit
Separate than what everybody else do
That was a part of my thang
And guess what
Everybody really liked a nigga for back then
I'm individual and all
I don't like to follow the masses
I don't need diamonds to shine
Just me and my music

Conscience of my surroundings, I surround me with music
Any thinking like my fews, I'm drowned in the music
Anything can light my fuse, I learned to defuse it
Power’s in the mind, body and soul if you use it
I'm eschimo cold, I post with the muses
I ain't good at excuses, don't botter to use them
Look up to the heaven to see if your dad's where the G’s is
Posted on the clouds, blowing loud with Jesus
I could walk on mountain tops with Beligians
Go to every college speak collegic thesis, of life, life, life

I could walk over the gravel and document each travel
Reacting to each and every actual action
Like animal stripes, like a Bengal tiger
Renaissance rider power
Detect like a Geiger counter

Why you wanna push my buttons?
Acting like you doing something
Why you wanna say something?
Knowin that the homies coming?
Knowin when the homies comin
And everybody's looking wondering
Why you actin like you doin something?
Or maybe you just buzzin

Maybe it’s because you’re right, take on the door right
Maybe it's because you try
That brought yo pussy sky high
Living legends anyway, maybe in another state

We getting caught in the force of controversy
To calmin my nerves urgent before some of you out the country
Magnanimous experience
Just the experience, experiments serious to life, life
Just a piece of the heaven, raining down the spoken lesson's a present
Distant destined, future, past, present, life, life
Every breath that I take, they love me cause they something the life

Smoked out, blowed out, life's hard, no doubt
Drink up, get down, load up, roll out
Me and young Gotti got the whole spot sold out
Way too high, no coat when it's cold out
Show up, show out, we so in, they so out
We roll in, they roll out
They go home, they go pow
The page in the book that's the one the niggas throw out
Turn into a hater cause the nigga turned his ho out
They say it's hate but it's really love
Cause I'm really living in the life that they dreaming of
Hummin out the mollies with the models and the parties with the bottles
Like 24/7 on the gas hit the throttle
No brakes, no mistakes
Homie I'm doing what I love and it's just great
Just wait, I'mma be where I'm tryina be
Right on time for the life, you just lay

[Hook]
Maybe it’s because you’re right, take on the door right
Maybe it's because you try
That brought yo pussy sky high
Living legends anyway, maybe in another state

We getting caught in the force of controversy
To calmin my nerves urgent before some of you out the country
