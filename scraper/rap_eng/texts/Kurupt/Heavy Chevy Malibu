[Hook]
Heavy Chevy Malibu
On my way to Malibu
Looking for a pile of you
Eyes like a Malamute
Me and Justin Credible
Me and Justin Credible
Me and Justin Credible
Looking for a few of you
The party's at 9
The party's at 9
The party just started, you're sitting or you're driving
Or you're J cruising
Or you're J cruising
Or you're J cruising
You gotta stay moving

[Verse 1]
Every day rolling
Everything golden
Fresh off of work
Loving every moment

Tonight, I'mma do it big, riding in my car
Turn on the radio, bang and lift off
Turn on the radio, bang and lift off
That's why it's just us

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Mind on my money
Handling mine with a handlebar grip on reality signs
I'm a week away from next
Nine paychecks, but looking like I ain't got paid yet

When you see me on TV
Look at how I'm supposed to be
Feeling like a million three
Power 106 and we

Heavy Chevy Malibu
On my way to Malibu
Looking for a pile of you
Eyes like a Malamute
Me and Justin Credible
Me and Justin Credible
Or you're J cruising
Or you're J cruising
Loving every moment
Loving every moment

[Hook]
