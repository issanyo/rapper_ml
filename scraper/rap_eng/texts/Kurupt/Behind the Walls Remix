[Kurupt]
Mike Dean hook me up with that remix homie

[Kurupt] + (Shyne)
Burn so crooked (crooked)   (Eastcoast)
The poet likes to spit (spit)  (My Nigga)(Gangsta Mix)
Kareem, that's my dog    (Gangsta Mix)
Life, Behind the Walls   (Gangsta Mix)
Livin' life, behind the walls   (Brooklyn)
Yeah, welcome to Oz niggas, surprise niggas..

[Kurupt]
Kurupt and Daz, grips on a handle, two to the mandible
Fo's and E's, bustas and G's
Pound and Shyne, hammer quick this for me one more
Up and Down, In and Out
Spinning Out, spinning in and out
I seen niggas like you that usually get blasted
Cameras to remove you, lies over caskets
Open season, rhyme a reason
Crimetime, primetime, D-I-C
Young Gagstra, step in and dump on the hostages
Smoke like sausages, niggas covering their heads like ostraches
Ostrasice, swallow like mausages..
CO so crooked (crooked)
Come equipped when the shank sticks

[Chorus One: Kurupt - Nate Dogg]
(Its Gonna be Alright) Yeah, that's my dogg

Livin Life Behind the Walls
Suckers - (yall can't sleep tonight) welcome to Oz niggas; surprise niggas

[Chorus Two: Nate Dogg]
West coast representin for all my doggs (Eastcoast)
One love to my doggs behind the walls  (Gangsta Mix)
Nate Dogg and I'm tight for all of y'all  (Gangsta Mix)
Stand strong, stand tall, and never fall (Gangsta Mix)
West coast representin for all my doggs (Gangsta Mix)
One love to my doggs behind the walls  (Eastcoast, Brooklyn)

Stand strong, stand tall, and never fall  (Vietnam)

[Shyne]

Trunk full of cash, gangsta roll

It ain't where u from, is where your gat at
Keep mine on my lap, windows black
Tough is hard, white is soft, monominus ship
Like im lovin this shit, guerilla nigga in the flesh
Killa nigga, hittin ur vest

Blood is a bloodsport, hittin that porsche
Head that port, where u known that horse

Revenge is a bitch, can't wait to fuck

Murderous Mr. Ketley my homie

[Chorus] - Repeat

Well I've arrived at my new home - cell three (huh)

It's goin down in the mornin on me  (Kurupt)
Soon as they say "Hey line up," let's leave  (Me.)
Right now the nigga just as safe as can be  (Daz)
But when we hit the kitchen maaan sleep  (Shyne)

[Kurupt]
I'm like you wanna bang nigga, with yo bangin head
You wanna hang like a G fool, hangin head
Where all the gangstas at, rollin through homie
Fleetwoods cadillacs straight gangsta mash
Befo I got stuck, I was cool as fuck
On the streets nigga, like I ain't give a fuck
I had Daz by my side, my lil' bro
And this is how we do it nigga, already to dump
I got a bitch, shes known for eatin a dick
I never gave a fuck nigga, never gave a shit
Its me and Mike Dean, doin what the fuck we wanna do
With M-16's niggas clearin the scene
This is the gangsta lean, and the gangsta vibe
Keep it gangstafied, nigga do or die
Yeah I roll with them niggas cause its ride or die
And I always get high, nigga living my life (bitch niggaaa)

[Chorus] - Repeat 2X
