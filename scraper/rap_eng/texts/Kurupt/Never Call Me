[Verse 1]
Oh boy, I'ma have to call them boys on you
Awe damn, awe damn, I'ma have to call that man on you
Something, something, something must be really wrong with you
Why can't you just tell the fuckin' truth now?
Yes your mama did, she raised a fool, wow
What the fuck did you learn in that schoolhouse?
Chasing girls to chasin' thrills
Takin' pills in the hills, Slauson Hills, Overhills might get you killed
And I won't come 'round them parts no more
Do not run your mouth no more
I can't protect you no more
It's out of my hands for sure

[Chorus]
You should've called me
Why you never call me?
Why you never call me?
Ohh, you should've called me
Why you never call me?
Why you never call me?
Ohh..

[Verse 2]
Okay, now you wanna say all that I done to ya
You knew all along that I wasn't the one for you
So let's stop pretending like we were in love
We never shared anything but the drugs
We were both numb, never had anything real between us
You really must
Be smoking that crazy shit, in my city talkin' crazy shit
But you ain't know I'm a crazy bitch
And tell your lawyer that I ain't paying shit
Maybe you should chill, really in your feels
My bros really in the field
Neighborhood is really real and they don't play that here
You shouldn't say that here
You should've made it clear, my dear
You should've called me

[Chorus]
You should've called me
Why you never call me?
Why you never call me?
Ohh, you should've called me
Why you never call me?
Ohh..
You, you, you, you
You should've called me
You, you, you, you
Ohh, oh..
You, you, you, you
You should've called me
You, you, you, you

[Outro: Kurupt]
Now hey sis, I'ma let you know like this
Hit me right back, this Kurupt, okay?
All these niggas with this bullshit, man, fuck these niggas mayne
The 60's, we ain't worried bout none of these muthafuckin' bustas
Ya understand me?
From the Overhill to the fronts to the back mayne
We pushin' this line to d'nine
So don't worry 'bout none of this shit from this funny ass nigga
Don't worry 'bout him callin' you and all the rest of that shit
You know what? It's his lost, ya know what I'm sayin'?
I'm pretty p'd
I heard the homie, the homie called me and was like
"Man Jhené trippin, man this buster ass nigga got her mind fucked up"
I'm like "No not Jhené"
Man fuck that nigga mayne
Né-né, you hit me I got you, you understand me?
These niggas is busters, fuck that nigga and fuck his friends, and his bitch
He's nothin my nigga, you are the one, everyone else is 2's and 3's

Don't make me call your mama now, I'll track you down
