(Intro: Snoop)
Yea
Still like 1994
Kato
Dogg
So fresh
Yea, sing it baby
Snoop Dogg

(Verse: Snoop)
Doggie, yes sir, back with the extras
Hard on a bitch flow, macking on some Heffers
Smoking out VIP, bossing with the fellaz
Bitches on a pimp dick, niggas getting jealous
I don't give a fuck, niggas get nothing when the Dogg in this motherfucker functioning
Bad bitches! Yea, I got a bunch of them
On my dick! And I don't pay nothing
That's on my bitch

(Verse: Kurupt)
Yea, I'm posted with Kato, we know
Smoking jalapeno
In New York with Guido, sippin on vino
With a bad bitch from Rio
Rio all the way to Reno
We know hoes
Let the horns play, say it like you mean it
Mean it like you say, cut from a different cloth
Here motherfucker, South Central LA
Mean it like it's said, read it how it's read

(Hook: Ida Corr & (Snoop))
(Let the horns play)
Now let the horns play
(Give it to me now
Let the horns play)

(Now put something in the air
Let the horns play)
Now let the horns play
(Give it to me now
Let the horns play)
Now let the horns play

(Verse: Kurupt)
Yup, it's bout that time
Everyday Los Angeles state of mind
Long Beach living, heavy state driven
Gotta get it how I'm livin, presidential ambition
I'm a rider, sole provider of this game
Same old same, some things change
Same old things, different day and age
But I'mma keep doing my thang

(Verse: Snoop)
We turnt up, turn em out
Pourin drink in they mouth
Baby wanna act up, check back with the dog
When you get your matter
Sit on back lil bitch and drink this glass up, I'mma smoke this Heffer
Get my party on and get fucked up
Smoke real big, kush blunts up
I make the club crack when I floss through
And then I shut it down, that's what a boss do

(Hook: Ida Corr & (Snoop))
(Let the horns play)
Now let the horns play
(Give it to me now

Let the horns play)
Now let the horns play
