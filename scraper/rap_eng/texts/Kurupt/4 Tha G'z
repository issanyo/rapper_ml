[Intro]
Gangsta’d up
Yea G’d up, suckas
Dogg pound that’s gangsta shit
Kurupt

[Verse 1]
I was trained for terrain
Fire for the flame
Fitted four full a cocaine
Blocks from the cops
Served in the word
Curved in the sherm and it spread like germs
Simple in the middle make them giggle like hoes
Wiggle like worms
What makes this different from that
Acquiped to hit like whipple ball bats
But I’m a talent and I style it how I wanna style
Phrase it how wanna phrase
Verbal amazing, energetic, poetic I see you just like I tell it
Pricings a relic amazing I package you then sell it

[Chorus]
This is for tha Gz, this is for tha husslas
This is for tha husslas, now back to the Gz
This is for tha Gz
501s on in the fire storm breeze
Powerful squeeze
This is tha begining, chevrot bending
Like this ain't what we suppose to do
Nigga this for tha Gz
501s on in the fire storm breeze
Powerful squeeze
This is tha begining, chevrot bending
Like this ain't what we suppose to do
Yea 50gz make em bounce
Foes and snitches nigga

[Verse 2]
I had a ball in Tennessee
Coronas and Hennessy
Powerful attenamy load a symphony
California, nigga nigga, yea yell it to the world
French braids and curls
Cop it might switch but the tops it goin twitch and raise the glitch
See I ran through memphis and bleep the fuck out
Geep the fuck out, tweek the fuck out
So it’s alright caskets, romeos and stacys
Imma DLC y’all in texas
When I with Tracy
You got sumn behind me
But just can’t face me
Trace me, race me,ice me or ace me
Replace me or taze me
I’ll show you I got force
Been jugglin I-mac neos in tha Comcourse


[Chorus]
