[Verse]
We got d laws comin out,yo man Kurupt, to shoot, right now
And ah, that’s goin’ hit the internet real soon
We gon’ really teach y’all how to, how to go back an do your crypt’n and do your blood’n
But we really do owe our respect you know cause
What I always say is a lot a this is our fault
Because we didn’t get a chance to really teach d babies how to come up
And really be men an how to deal wit these here crews
And now we got a series that’s gon’ come out soon
That’s gon’ give these babies some direction on how to really be like men
And respect dey selves, and respect their women and respect there gal
But it’s gon’ be a straight hood shit
It ain’t on no, it ain’t on no bitch shit
We ain’t finna teach ya how to be bitches
We gon’ teach ya how to be a man, an how to respect d man
And how to get yo money
Yo prepare fo d law, it’s gon’ be introduced real soon
