Find me some
Drugs, drugs, drugs, drugs

Find me some
Drugs, drugs, drugs, drugs

Prescription pills, Darvocet, Oxycontin, Mescaline
And a whole array of synthetic medicine
Crystal glass, Ketamine, Heroin, Cyanide dream
And a whole generation laughs

It’s not the drugs that killed your mom
It’s not the blade that raped your brother
A whole world is suffering
Can’t be the love we lost as children
Can’t be the price of a thousand prostitute graves
Nobody loves here, everybody hates

I will survive
Why are you dancing with the devil?
I will survive
When the sun sets down on my heart
When the sun sets down I’m a star
Why dance with the devil when you have me?

I feel so alone in a state of depression
At an all time low...
Closed in, in deception
Where nobody would know

Lysergic acid, psycho active, Morphine, Coke, sodomy
At war with society (Charge!)
Self-medication, Codeine supply, self-mutilation
Sex taught suicide
It’s not the drug that killed my soul
Not the pain of losing blood
In a ghost town paid symphony
Can’t be the love we lost as children
Can’t be the price of fucking saving your skin

Yeah, nobody loves here, everybody hates
I will survive
Why are you dancing with the devil?
I will survive
Why are you dancing with the devil?
When the sun sets down on my heart
When the sun sets down I’m a star

I will survive
Why are you dancing with the devil?
I will survive
Why are you dancing with the devil?
When the sun sets down on my heart
When the sun sets down I’m a star
Why dance with the devil when you have me?

Mushrooms, crack
My mind is cracked
My mind is trapped
My spine is tapped
A little bit of lean
Feels like I'm on Cyanide, Methamphetamines
Burned, churned
Nightmares, dreams
Heaven, hell
Help me, please
Screams, yells
Yearning, laughing
Anything could happen
I feel so trapped in
Nobody loves me, everybody hates
Suicidal mind, stays slipping on a plate
Poison in my veins, no body cares
If I live, if I die
No reason to be here
Ease the pain, Vicodin to settle down
Oughta be going crazy
I got to settle in
I feel a little hazy
A little heroin, I close my eyes
Never to awake again
