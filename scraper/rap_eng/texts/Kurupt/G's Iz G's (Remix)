[Intro]
(“One of these motherfuckers different”)
(News broadcast: “Outside the South Central area, few cared about the violence because it didn’t affect them”)
(Snoop: “Dogghouse style”)
(Redman: “Cali’s in the house!”)
(Snoop: “Bustas are bustas and G’s are G’s”) (Repeat 3X)

[Verse 1: Snoop Dogg]
Easily I approach, the microphone because I ain’t no joke
It’s Big Snoop Dogg, I got you all up out of your soul
Mash with me, CaTashtrophe, I’m so outta control
Behind the wheel, I spilled my drink on the flo’
If the bitch wit’ me, loco, she get naked for sho’
Taking it slow, make my mail grow
Breaking a hoe, your nigga got game, ya know

[Verse 2: Tash]
And I’m the triple-fly dancer, rhyme killer with the glow
That don’t chase y’all, I replace y’all, that go for any hoe
Slow motion, West Coastin’, Liks convulsion
Tash and Battlecat’ll keep ya overdosin’ with the potion
Get the picture? My rap style’a hit ya ‘til you knock out
Tash, Kurupt, Snoop, and X’ll clear your whole block out
Y’all ain’t creepin’, we peepin’ how y’all do
Instead of tryna change rap, you lettin’ rap change you, homie

[Verse 3: Snoop Dogg]
Some niggas say that they will but they don’t
A lot of ‘em do but a lot of ‘em won’t
That’s the riff raff I don’t keep
That’s probably why I get no muthafuckin’ sleep
I’m up all night in the studio
Gettin’ tore up from the floor up with my nephew, that nigga Rico
A drunkie and a junkie
My lo Cat made the beat so you know this muthafucka funky

[Hook: Tash]
‘Cause bustas is bustas and G’z iz G’z
But can’t nobody bust it down like MC’s like these
See, bustas is bustas and G’s is G’s
But can’t nobody put it down like my D-O-G’s

[Post-Hook: Snoop + (Tash)]
Tash, they say you drink too much
(That’s a trip Big Snoop, they say you smoke too much)
Tash, they say you drink too much
(That’s a trip Snoopy Snoop, they say you smoke too much, nigga)

[Verse 4: Kurupt]
I’m a busta banger, certified high rise
Hallucinogenic montage mirage
Hell, he’s the third, with the billion-dollar words
With the verve and swerve, trunked up with birds
Blast addict, spasmatic, dump make ya run ‘til ya asthmatic
Then charismatic
DPG battalion, X, Tashish, blazing the indica and hashish, muthafucka

[Verse 5: Xzibit]
Now it’s the last man standing, who, recklessly abandon you
A bro up off Xanadu, that’s exactly what I plan to do
I murder half the population, call me Hannibal, the cannibal
I’m living proof that man came from animals
Believe it or not, you will get shot
Point blank range, for all the heads that like to get hot (Come on)
X marks the spot
Any problems that we got inside of the venue gon’ get handled in the parking lot

[Hook: Tash]
‘Cause bustas is bustas and G’z iz G’z
But can’t nobody bust it down like MC’s like these
See, bustas is bustas and G’z is G’z
But can’t nobody put it down like my D-O-G’s

[Post-Hook: Snoop + (Tash)]
Tash, they say you drink too much
(That’s a trip Big Snoop, they say you smoke too much)
Tash, they say you drink too much
(That’s a trip Snoopy Snoop, they say you smoke too much, nigga)

[Verse 6: Snoop Dogg]
Knock knock, who is it?
It’s the Eastsidin’, rip ridin’, Dogghouse Crip division
And we have home provisions
No suckers, just drank, weed, and plenty of bitches
Bring some or don’t come at all
Ain’t nothin’ but an Alkaholik party, y’all
It’s an Alkaholik party, y’all
Shake it up, shake it up
All the homeboys break it up

[Verse 7: Kurupt]
The impenetrable, sentinel, criminal, mineral
Touch it like tentacles, tactical, acrobatical
My specialty warfare, nuclear venom
Two shots to bust ‘fore I’m all up in ‘em
I shook ‘em, descend ‘em, millennium, abdomenium form
Electrical brainstorm is born, it’s on
Mind soup shot off like harpoons
Start shrooms, baboons, I’mma be there soon
Kurupt!

[Verse 8: Tash]
Young Gotti set it off on anybody
From the second that you spot ‘em, we red dot ‘em
Who shot ‘em?
I can’t tell y’all who got ‘em, but he got
Two wrongs don’t make a right, two songs don’t make ya tight
See, it’s Tash night tonight, tomorrow the same script
I’m always hearing songs by niggas that can’t rip
We come equipped, what we throw, you receivin’
Y’all ain’t fuckin’ with my homeboys, please believe it

[Outro: Snoop + (Tash)]
Bustas are bustas and G’z are G’z
(Please believe it, loved ones)
Bustas are bustas and G’z are G’z
How we do it y’all? Catashtrophe!
Bustas are bustas and G’z are G’z
(You know how we do it y’all; this the West Coast shit y’all been missing)
Bustas are bustas and G’z are G’z
(They say the West Coast is back; I ain’t know we went nowhere, homie
You know how we do it, baby)
Bustas are bustas and G’z are G’z
(We got Battlecat on the beat, we got Catashtrophe, we got X-to-the-Z, Xzibit)
Bustas are bustas and G’z are G’z
(Snoop Dogg over there smoking back to back, we got Kurupt Calhoun, ya know)
Bustas are bustas and G’s are G’s
(We got somebody staring at me—what the fuck is you looking at?)
Bustas are bustas and G’z are G’z
(Redman: “Cali’s in the house!”)
It’s official, like a gangsta with a pistol
