[Intro: Snoop Dogg]
Bitches ain't shit but hoes and tricks

[Hook: Snoop Dogg]
Bitches ain't shit but hoes and tricks
Lick on these nuts and suck the dick
Gets the fuck out after you're done
Then I hops in my ride to make a quick run
Bitches ain't shit but hoes and tricks
Lick on these nuts and suck the dick
Gets the fuck out after you're done
Then I hops in my ride to make a quick run

[Verse 1: Dr. Dre]
I used to know a bitch named Eric Wright
We used to roll around and fuck the hoes at night
Tighter than a motherfucka with the gangsta beats
And we was balling on the motherfucking Compton streets
Peep, the shit got deep and it was on
Number 1 song after number 1 song
Long as my motherfucking pockets was fat
I didn't give a fuck where the bitch was at
But she was hanging with a white bitch doing the shit she do
Sucking on his dick just to get a buck or two
And the few ends she got didn't mean nothing
Now she's suing cause the shit she be doing ain't shit
Bitch can't hang with the streets, she found herself short
So now she's taking me to court
It's real conversation for your ass
So recognize, and pass to Daz

[Verse 2: Dat Nigga Daz]
Now as I'm rolling with my nigga Dre and Eastwood
Fucking hoes, clocking dough, up to no good
We flip-flop and serve hoes like flapjacks
(Snoop: But we don't love them hoes) Bitch, and it's like that
This is what you look for in a ho who got cash flow
You run up in them hoes and grab the cash
And get your dash on
While you're chilling with your homies and shit
And how my niggas kick the anthem like this
(Biatch)

[Hook: Snoop Dogg]
Bitches ain't shit but hoes and tricks
Lick on these nuts and suck the dick
Gets the fuck out after you're done
Then I hops in my ride to make a quick run

[Verse 3: Kurupt]
To the store, to get me a 4-0
Snoop Doggy-Dogg paged, that must mean more hoes
So I head down the street to Long Beach
Just so I could meet a freak
To lick me from my head to my feet
And I'm here, now I'm ready to be done up
Nothing but homies around, so I puts my gun up
Bitches on my nuts like clothes
But I'm from Tha Pound and "we don't love them hoes"
How could you trust a ho? (Snoop: Why?)
Cause a ho's a trick
We don't love them tricks (Snoop: Why?)
Cause a trick's a bitch
And my dick's constantly in her mouth
Turning them trick-ass hoes the fuck out now

[Verse 4: Snoop Dogg]
I once had a bitch named Annie Mae
Used to be all in them guts like every day
The pussy was the bomb, had a nigga on sprung
I was in love like a motherfucka, licking the pearl tongue
The homies used to tell me that she wasn't no good
But I'm the maniac in black, Mr. Snoop Eastwood
So I figure niggas wouldn't trip with mine
Guess what? Got gaffled by one-time
I'm back to the motherfucking county jail
6 months on my chest, now it's time to bail
I gets released on a hot sunny day
My nigga D.O.C. and my homie Dr. Dre
Scoop in a coupe, "Snoop we got news
Your girl was tricking while you was draped in your county blues"
I ain't been out a second
And already gotta do some motherfucking chin-checkin'
Move up the block as we groove up the block
See my girl's house, "Dre, pass the Glock"
Kick in the do', I look on the flo'
It's my little cousin Daz and he's fucking my ho, yo
(Bitches ain't shit)
I un-cock my shit
I'm heart-broke but I'm still loc'ed
Man, fuck a bitch

[Hook: Snoop Dogg]
Bitches ain't shit but hoes and tricks
Lick on these nuts and suck the dick
Gets the fuck out after you're done
Then I hops in my ride to make a quick run
Bitches ain't shit but hoes and tricks
Lick on these nuts and suck the dick
Gets the fuck out after you're done
Then I hops in my ride to make a quick run
Bitches ain't shit

[Verse 5: Jewell]
I don't give a fuck about a bitch
But I and her know that they can't fade this
Cause I'm doin my own thing down with the swang
I'm hanging with Death Row like it ain't no thang
I say you know you can't deal, cause I'm a bitch that's real
Motherfuckers need to step back, hell yeah they need to chill
Because I don't give a fuck, and I don't give a fuck
And I don't give a fuck, I don't give a fuck
And now I gotta do some shit that's clean
But when I'm on a dick, hell yeah, I get real mean, hah
Like a washing machine I can wash the clothes
All the hoes knows that I'm on the flo', ho
But they can't hang with my type of swang
I ain't trying to say I suck every ding-a-lang
But just the juicy ones with the tip of the tongue
And then they're sprung, and with the nuts hung

[Outro: Snoop Dogg]
Bitches ain't shit
