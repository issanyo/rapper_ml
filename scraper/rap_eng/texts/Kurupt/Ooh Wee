[Intro: Teena Marie]
If you feeling what you see now
And you like to talk to me now
Keep it postal baby please now
Got me saying ooh ooh wee now

[Verse 1: Teena]
I never thought I'd find my love serene
Or someone to fulfill my childhood dreams yeah
The moment that you walked into the room
I knew that fairy tales do really come true
It must have been the flowers you gave me
Or could it have been the way you smiled?
I think it was the introduction
Perhaps it was the kiss

[Hook: Teena]
Baby ooh wee
You were dressed to the night
Fell in love with you, fine
And the gangsta smile
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh wee mmm baby ooh wee
I ain't lying I would swear and
Like a 3-57
Smith Wesson Magnum
Baby, baby yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 2: Teena]
First back to me we was kicking back
You're in my dressing room and talking smack boy
I'm gonna call you my perfect man to me
And sing to him like we we got to be free
It must have been the O.G. Gators
Or could have been the rim you won
I think it was the introduction
Perhaps it was the kiss

[Hook: Teena]
Baby ooh wee
You were dressed to the night
You were looking so fine
And the gangsta smile
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh wee mm baby ooh wee
I ain't lying I would swear and
Like a 3-57
Smith Wesson Magnum
Baby, baby yeah, yeah, yeah

[Bridge: Teena]
I'm not the kind of girl, who needs expensive things
Baby no no, don't need no fancy cars, don't need no diamond rings
Just pay attention to my heart it's telling things
I'll build the castle out of sand, before a king fit for a queen

[Hook: Teena]
You were dressed to the night
Fell in love with you fine
And that gangsta smile
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh wee
I ain't lying I would swear and
Like a 3-57
Smith Wesson Magnum
Baby, baby yeah, yeah, yeah

[Outro: Teena]
Ooh he's coming over here
And he got a cane
Just be easy baby
Don't let it corrupt you

[Kurupt]
Wasup lil mama
I picked you up by yo pretty thing
You know what I mean?
Uh, what's crackin' with you?
Mmm what you drinkin' on baby?
I'd like to buy you a drink
You know what? We need to come a little bit closer to a playa
