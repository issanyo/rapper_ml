(Intro)

(Verse 1: Kurupt)
When the acid rain falls
Your frame falls
I'll make your chains spark the lead, the chainsaws
I'm not captivated
And I'm not captive
Free as a bird to fly out on Perv
Ain't here for no frontin'
Just to say a little somethin'
Rack up the gauge, spray a lil' something'
My momma always told me
Right before she'd hold me:
"Look, don't tell me... Don't say it... Just show me"
Over and over again
It sunk in slowly
I'm a... bomb shell
Bomb-o-rama, high times is proper
I'm eqipped with 4 clips
And all the accessories
For all them Sesame Street G's
That pestin' me
Not servin' neccessaties
In the battle, I'm raw
Galactica, mother
Light 'em up like battle star
Galactica, mother

(Chorus)
I'mma show you how I do it over here (over here)
If you show me how you do it over there (over there)
I'm 'bout to get a meal ticket
Put that on something
I'm about to get payed
Put that on something
I put that on my momma
Put that on something
That's on e'rythang
Nigga, put that on something
I'm about to get a meal ticket
Put that on something
I'm about to get payed
Put that on something
I put that on my momma
Put that on something
That's on e'rythang
Nigga, put that on something
Put that on something...
Put that on something...
Nigga, put that on something...

(Verse 2: Kurupt)
I put that on my shoes and sox
My moms and my pops
My bomb drops, my 5 Glocks, and my knots
How you gonna tell me what I'm gonna do?
When I'm not
When I'm hot
Is when you can consider it got
In one false move
Is when the vaults move
Cracked in the middle like eggs
Spread on the table
Your pulse halts
Boy, get your game together
This ain't to die together
?This ain't the ain't together?
Now ain't this somethin'?
A youngster just swerved up
The homie just swerved up
Hold up!
I'mma be goin' tonight
I ran into the homies
It's on tonight
I gotta throw on my stars and my khakis tonight

(Chorus)
I'mma show you how I do it over here (over here)
If you show me how you do it over there (what?!)
I'm 'bout to get a meal ticket
Put that on something
I'm about to get payed
Put that on something
I put that on my momma
Put that on something (Really?)
That's on e'rythang
Put that on something (For real)
I'm about to get a meal ticket
Put that on something
I'm about to get payed
Put that on something
I put that on my momma
Put that on something
That's on e'rythang
Put that on something
Yeah...
That's on the Pound, nigga
Put that on something
Fool, put that on something...

(Verse 3: Kurupt)
I know a few of y'all could ??? the time to spit off
After bustin' lead off
Knockin' a nigga head off
Fa sho
Hard core, fa sho
Predator
Mentor
Antra entrepenuer [--- NOT SURE ABOUT SPELLING
Radical and raw assasin, maskin'
Caskets and drastics tactics
Quick
To flip 'em like bricks
Put a little soul in your strive, home boy
If you ever think about tryin' to ride, home boy
Caticalism
Reactions leads to another food up
Fool across the across the bridge with six kids, get clips
And everything 'quipped with that
Like Daz said: "Retaliation, Revenge & Getback"
Like Daz said: "If you ever need me homie, you know what to do"
If I never said it before, the same applies for you
(This one's for yooooou)

(Chorus)
I'mma show you how I do it over here (over here)
Now y'all show me how you do it over there (over there)
I ride with the West Coast (West Coast)
Put that on something
I ride with the East Coast (East Coast)
Put that on something
I put that on my momma
Put that on something
That's on e'rythang
Put that on something
I ride with up north (Up north)
Put that on something
I ride with the dirty south (Dirty south)
Put that on something
I put that on my momma
Put that on something
That's on e'rythang
Fool, put that on something
Yeah...
Nigga, put that on something...
Put that on something

(Outro: Kurupt & Freeze)
I put that on the hood
Put that on something
I put that on my kids
Put that on something
I put that on my life
Put that on something
I put that on e'rythang
Put that on something
I put that on my grandkids
Put that on something
I put that on e'rythang
Put that on something
I put that on my life
Put that on something
Put that on something
Put that on something
Is that right? (Oh really?)
Put that on something then... Huh?!
Put that on something you love
Something that you care about
Something that you would never give up
Put that on something
Put that on something
Put that on something
(I put that on my kids)
You know what I mean?
Put that on something, homie
Huh?
Put that on something...
(Repeat over and over 'til end)
