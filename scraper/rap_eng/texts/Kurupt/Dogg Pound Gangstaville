[Intro: Snoop Dogg]
Dogg, Pound, Gangsta, nigga
Nate Dogg, D-O-double G... ha ha, '98
Check this out y'all
For all the gangstas out there

[Verse 1: Snoop Dogg]
All I know and all I do is
D-P-G with the rest of my crew
We through with milken milli vanilli
Silly niggas who be rappin' but they really be actin'
I'm smackin' niggas in they face for the '9-8
My DJ Warren G and my homeboy Nate
The game won't wait, so we paper chase
And watch out for them suckas who paper hate
Try to drop some shit to keep ya straight
I keep my niggas on a mission and the suckas keep wishin'
But my success, oh yes it's fresh
Here's a toast to the Eastside, L.B. for lizie
You can call me what you wanna
Or you can catch me in the Navigator bendin' a corner
I'm representin', just like Billy Clinton
I smack a bitch and make my chips, then dip
For Dogg Pound Gangsta click

[Chorus: Nate Dogg]
Don't you wanna come with me to Dogg Pound Gangstaville?
We can give you what you need in Dogg Pound Gangstaville
Don't you wanna come with me to Dogg Pound Gangstaville?
We can give you what you need in Dogg Pound Gangstaville

[Verse 2: Nate Dogg]
Once upon a time in the land of the foolish man
There lived a man who claimed to be holdin' aces in his hand
He played wrong once and played 'em twice
And played 'em wrong again
Now it's my turn to play the game
And I guarantee I'll win
Very best I have to be and I hope you understand
I got my game from Gangstaville
Eastside of gangsta land (come with me)

[Chorus: Nate Dogg]
Don't you wanna come with me to Dogg Pound Gangstaville?
We can give you what you need in Dogg Pound Gangstaville
Don't you wanna come with me to Dogg Pound Gangstaville?
We can give you what you need in Dogg Pound Gangstaville

[Verse 3: Kurupt]
Well you can give me half your loot, nigga
Or else I'ma shoot, nigga
I do what G's do, I ride, I slides, I dips
Double for us fool, where's the clips?
You'll find I hit your spine and shake your hips with hollow tips
It's the modern day me, with the state of art modern day heat
Motherfuckin' modern day G
No good, fo' sho' good
Put this nigga on the hood
Then let me put him back the fuck off, like that
You fuckin' with the Kobe Bryant of rap
With a mack 11 cocked back ready for sure, ready for war
For real, enter if you will
In the land we call Dogg Pound Gangstaville
All we do is smoke, and just so you know -
My motto is "fuck you bitch and fuck a ho"

[Chorus: Nate Dogg]
Don't you wanna come with me to Dogg Pound Gangstaville?
We can give you what you need in Dogg Pound Gangstaville
Don't you wanna come with me to Dogg Pound Gangstaville?
We can give you what you need in Dogg Pound Gangstaville
Don't you wanna come with me to Dogg Pound Gangstaville?
We can give you what you need in Dogg Pound Gangstaville
Don't you wanna come with me to Dogg Pound Gangstaville?
We can give you what you need in Dogg Pound Gangstaville
