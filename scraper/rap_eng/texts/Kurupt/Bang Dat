[Chorus]
Get it, Get it, Get it, Get it, Get it, Get it, Get it
We gon’ get it (Get it, Get it, Get it, Get it)

[Verse 1]
Get a nickel, get a dime, gimme yours, gimme mine
Cause I’m lookin’ for a bad bitch, stuck up in the line
Pull her to the front, don’t front, we stunt
Blaze off a blunt, blow smoke on a punk
Dip through the club, bad bitch in the back
All I wanna know is where dem real niggas at
Got a seat wit us,we’re heavy hitters
Pigs they fuck wit us,but can’t get rid a us
Cause we keep smashin, on and on
Step by step, and song by song (song)
Make you wanna swing dat,dpgc nigga don’t bang dat (bang dat)
And I’m ready for whateva, got d game in da palm a ma hands
I’m all set, ready for the big dance
Just in case you didn’t know about the homies on the low
The same ones from ‘94, there’s a big chance
I might have to get down and have a sit down
A doggpound nigga, just keep us out your mouth (your mouth)
I like hood rats, I like strippers, this is dedicated to all my niggas
Bounce in the 6 4’s sippin’ on some gin an juice, when I was young I couldn’t wait to get loose
Cause back in the days we always got paid, we always shot face
I like wet pussy and bitches that’s strange
Posted at the spot where they serve cocaine, jus me and my game
I ain’t really had nobody who had real love for me
It’s jus always been me and my game, game (game)
(jus me and my game)
It’s jus always been me and my game, game (game)

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
I’m on the iller filler killer shit, spit up on it, get a brick
Get a lick, get it quick, knowin who you fucking wit
A savage on a hunt, ready power my opponent
The next down on it, get smoked on da corner
I’ll bash and destroy your boys, bring noise
After I lit em, i hit em up, just you and your boy
Being paranoid leave em swoll’n
Like a fast buff ass nigga on steroids, whip d inside of his ass like hemorrhoids
A nigga das, motherfucker hate it or love it you know what’s supper
The mac trigger yo ass up, like dinner or supper, the two 2 3’s nut em like butter
It’s the dpg’s don’t deal a pimp gangster, keep it in the family, do it by nature
See me in d club, acting real freaky, yes she shakin’ dat ass, baby wanna meet me
Yo whateva boo, I see you looking kinda thirsty
Yes she guzzle it down, see that patrone ma you hurt me
Make it 1 shot, 2 shots feelin all that alcohol, 3 shots 4 shots dragging her down the hall
On to the next bitch, on to the next tric, me and you, then she on to d next dick
Take it or leave it, I’m gone in a second,with lies and respect she strips you butt naked
(Nigga, you ain’t got no wands up)
Get a nickel, get a dime, gimme yours, gimme mine
Cause I’m lookin’ for a bad bitch, stuck up in the line
Pull her to the front, don’t front, we stunt
Blaze off a blunt, blow smoke on a punk
Dip through the club, bad bitch in the back
All I wanna know is where dem real niggas at
Got a seat wit us,we’re heavy hitters
Pigs they fuck wit us,but can’t get wit us
Cause we keep smashin, on and on
Step by step, and song by song (song)
Make you wanna swing dat,dpgc nigga don’t bang dat (bang dat,bang dat,bang dat)
