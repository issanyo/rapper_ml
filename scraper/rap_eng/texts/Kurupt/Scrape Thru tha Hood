[Intro]
Dog pound gangsters nigga, like young [?] said nigga, we're Buster banger , that means we bang on busters, nigga. Yeah, fly!

[Chorus: Kurupt]
I'm cold, so I oversee the homies, backtrack stop, push them up, There's the busters nigga!
Cold, and I'm rolling by alone, I'ma start busting and scraping Through the hood bumping nigga
I'm cold, so I oversee the homies, backtrack stop, push them up, There's the busters nigga!
Cold, and I'm rolling by alone, I'ma start busting and scraping Through the hood bumping nigga

[Verse 1: Kurupt]
I learned the hard way, if you don't want to listen, this is what you'll listen to
Police, nigga, awesome nigga, dumping through, banging on your door
Won't catch me slipping anymore!
People  pimping  up in this motherfucker
Now [?] yo' banging on busters up in this motherfucker
Don't you know, if you didn't listen to this pistol sizzling
[?] loosed and juiced, pistol whistling
Sky high, fly motherfucker!
Yelling: Die motherfucker! Die motherfucker!
If you want [?], motherfucker ? try motherfucker!
I'll put it in front of your spot, try motherfucker!
If you touch it, I'll give you my life motherfucker
Forever, [?] death, I'ma ride motherfucker
Heaters and TEC 9's, I supply motherfucker
Heaters and pipe-bombs, I provide motherfucker
Homicidal, pushing the front line motherfucker!

[Chorus: Kurupt]

[Verse 2:Kurupt]
Cold, but I don't get upset
Sacked this nigga up, and carved the set on his chest, nigga
Pistol clapping, make the heater, pop it back
Just like that! nigga, swipe that, you don't like that?
Want a [?] nigga? Get on the job, nigga!
Let's ride nigga, I'ma say it again
Let's ride nigga, let the TEC's fly nigga!
Erasing the sky nigga, talking the sky nigga!
You can't even even see the nigga your beside, nigga!
Look, besides nigga, see? it ain't no thing
Dog pound gang
Watch us bang
Come and show us what you mean!
Either don't get tapped from the back or the [?]
In the back, temple, kneecap or the spleen!

[Chorus: Kurupt]

[Verse 3:Kurupt]
Sinister, revelations
Of a different generation
Where head-ups don't matter no more
Where the guy that's [throwing?] the blow
That's for sure
More than anything you can think about and know, and got to hope
Gotta serve pussy from Vegas to the Navajo
From the Karma leaders to Magnolia to the Kalio
See? this is pressure
Because I'm thinking about busting my TEC up in this nigga's [?]
This nigga tripping
Thinking that he can get away stealing the nigga chips and bullshitting
What the fuck is wrong?
I'ma have to show them it's on!
I know them, it's on!
This is how [storm conforms?]!
Kurupt, [dumping Harley, kidnapping the ducts?]
My khaki's is paint nigga, and so is my chops
Dillinger, Gotti, semi's loaded and tucked
Like, which nigga 'been inquiring about Kurupt?
Which one of you niggers I'ma duct tape and dump?

[Chorus: Kurupt]
