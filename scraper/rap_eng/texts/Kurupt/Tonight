[Intro: Kurupt + (J-Ro)]
Yeah! (Where they at?)
Ey what's up?
A nigga tryin' to treat me like
Rain Man or Forest Gump
When I'm Einstein nigga (That's right)
J-Ro (What's up Kurupt?)
Please believe it (Oh yea)
We gon' do this shit real real big
Bonzi J Wells, on the beat
What's up, welcome home

[Chorus]
We all gon' bubble tonight
Let's hit the bar and get right
If you feel it, (raise your glass to the sky)
Let's get it crackin' tonight
Alright, all night
Let's get it crackin' tonight
It's J-Ro, Gotti tonight
Let's do it
Let's get it crackin' tonight

[J-Ro]
Now if I ever gave a fuck what y'all bitches think
I'd never have no motherfuckin' Hennessy to drink
I'm 'sposed to go to the club, grab and burp every bitches
Take 'em home, wash the steak sauce off my dishes
The only reason they do it - they think I got riches
I'm just speakin' the truth, I ain't tryin' to be malicious
My nigga King Tee told me not to trust 'em
These days I don't even like to discuss 'em
So I just keep bustin'
J-Ro, Kurupt, J Wells on production
And you know it's all custom

[Kurupt]
Knock on wood grain, the whole hood sayin'
Bitch you insane and give good brain
Dippin' down the streets on them golden thangs
It's a gang bang retreat for the niggas in the streets
I'ma take me a pint of Hennessy to the neck, I'm a wreck
Cause I'm too bent and this bitch won't get off my dick
Bitch, you actin' like you never seen a nigga on some gangsta shit
Flip bitch, flip like bricks and chip
And get the fuck off a nigga dick
I hit Hawthorne and holla at young Slip
Unload clips, so lil' niggas don't trip
Me and Slip never slippin', we all about bangin' and dippin'
Jackin' for D's and radio equipment

[J-Ro]
My rhymes slide through the air like cardinals and particles
Got niggas callin' audibles
I'll change the game, remain the same
Train in the rain, spit nothin' but flame
Body blows that you can't sustain
Hit the switch, bend the frame
Throw your hands up if you in the game
Roll that shit up and take it to the brain
(Take it to the brain)

[Chorus]
We all gon' bubble tonight
Let's hit the bar and get right
If you feel it, (raise your glass to the sky)
Let's get it crackin' tonight
Alright... all night
Let's get it crackin' tonight
It's J-Ro, Gotti tonight
Let's do it
Let's get it crackin' tonight

[Kurupt talking]
Yeah, we gon' keep it real gangsta'd up... and real cool
It's like California on a good old fashioned Sunday afternoon
You know what I'm talkin' 'bout?
J-Ro and Gotti... yeah
Bonzi J Wells on the beat, for all you suckas

[Chorus]
We all gon' bubble tonight
Let's hit the bar and get right
If you feel it, (raise your glass to the sky)
Let's get it crackin' tonight
Alright... all night
Let's get it crackin' tonight
It's J-Ro, Gotti tonight
Let's do it
We'll get it crackin' tonight

[Outro: J-Ro]
J-Ro and Gotti, movin' your body
It's like that, for the whole world, Wolfpac
Yeah
