Here I come, here I come, here I go
Here I come, here I go

Sometimes I wanna slow, sometimes I wanna quit
Money off the hustle, turn the key with the break
Ladies of all sides, ...some can handle it
But do they more scared, superficial

Official, like a ref with a whistle
It's all going back, go and get your issue
Optical delusion, illusion is real
That's a frenemy, friend and enemy
Real I make it to the next plateau I build
Morbius metamorphosing 2 pills
I could fight temptation if I had the will
Why you act so rude, attitude is trash
Everything about her is the tits and ass
Why you act all funny when you get some cash
Why you go broke when the election pass
We mad, mad, mad, mad

Sometimes I wanna slow, sometimes I wanna quit
Money off the hustle, turn the key with the break
Ladies of all sides, ...some can handle it
But do they more scared, superficial
Sometimes I wanna slow, sometimes I wanna quit
Sometimes I get paid, sometimes I get played

Nobody's 100% in the game, erythang man, erythang taken
Sometimes I'm on the grind, sometimes I fall behind
Everything in between and a tangled twine
Man it's hard to read the text, it's hard to see the signs
See you all tryina read my mind
Stop, it's hard for you to see I'm blind
See my eyes, I'm dead inside
40 years old, nate dogg died
Man, you read my mind, dead to the head, dead inside
Dead inside, dead inside, dead inside
Still I ride

Sometimes I wanna slow, sometimes I wanna quit
Money off the hustle, turn the key with the break
Ladies ball...some thin, some thick
I try forever to try to stand 100% true official
