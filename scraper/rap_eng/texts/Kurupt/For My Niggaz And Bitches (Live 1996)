[Spoken Word Intro: 2Pac]
Yeah
Don't stop (Once again, once again)
West Coast after shop (C'mon)
West Coast

[Song Intro: Snoop Dogg]
Now all my bitches and my niggas
Wave your motherfuckin' hands in the air
For all my bitches and my niggas
(We don't give a fuck, we don't give a fuck)
Wave your motherfuckin' hands in the air

[Verse 1: Kurupt]
Well it's that slow flow, D-O-double-G, nigga
See these other fools but you can't see me, nigga
Who am I?
Do or die (Yo)
So slow your roll, I'm In Control like Janet
The loc-est twenty-one year old nigga that's on this planet
Take it for granted, if ya wanna, because I'm gonna
Grab my strap then clear the corner, beeotch

[Chorus: Snoop Dogg]
So all my bitches and my niggas
Wave your motherfuckin hands in the air
And if you don't give a shit like we don't give a shit
Wave your motherfuckin fingers in the air
To all my niggas and my bitches
Wave your motherfuckin hands in the air
And if you don’t give a fuck like we don’t give a fuck
Keep your motherfuckin hands in the air

[Verse 2: Daz]
Now on a one, two, three who could it be
Coming with a grip of gangsta shit for ninety-three
So ninety-four's arrived nigga, back on up
And let me and my Dogg Kurupt fuck shit up
Now can't nobody see me here or there
Wherever I bails, I put it down all around
Cuz ain't shit for sale in the Coupe
With the beat flossin' off gold D's
And my cousin Snoop packs well, you know what I mean
And it don't take much, for the Dogg Pound to bust a cap
In your ass, for getting us all fucked up
Now check it, it's a calling for niggas like Doggs
Who supposed to be the shit, but steadily bitchin' like hoes
(Yes y'all) other Doggs (yes y'all) yiggy y'all
Stay full of that gin and juice and have a ball

[Verse 3: Kurupt]
I packs a strap, like that, I kicks it like this
Now how many bitches must get dicked?
Before they say, okay, Daz that nigga from back in the day
Ya never ever thought I'd see him bustin with Dr. Dre
Cuz I grips mics, I rips mics in half
Hoes be coming to my flat so I can tap that ass

[Chorus: Snoop Dogg]
So all my bitches and my niggas
Wave your motherfuckin hands in the air
And if you don't give a shit like we don't give a shit
Wave your motherfuckin hands in the air
To all my niggas and my bitches and my bitches and my niggas
Wave your motherfuckin hands in the air
And if you don’t give a fuck like we don’t give a fuck
Keep your motherfuckin hands in the air
