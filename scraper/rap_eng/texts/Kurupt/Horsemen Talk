[Intro: Killah Priest]
Yea, mothafuckas

[Hook: Killah Priest]
This is +Horsemen Talk+, Horsemen walk
Get the fuck out the way before The Horsemen stalk
We headless mothafuckas and we lacerate
Don't you know the shit could get real when your ass get smoked?
{​*gun shot*}​

This is Horsemen Talk, Horsemen walk
Get the fuck out the way before The Horsemen stalk
We headless mothafuckas and we lacerate
Don't you know the shit could get real when you wind up smoked?

[Verse One: Killah Priest]
I spit volcanoes, twist heads, spit lead
Then boast like the angels, the scorpion tongue
Come close I'mma sting you, I'm Morpheus' son
Part two to The Matrix, I'm atheist
Only God is my gauges and the clip is my church
Show the beginnin' and the end when I'm spittin' my verse
Voodoo curse brought back The Horsemen from the grave
Four headless mothafuckas now clappin' their gate
Stomp his chest in and put the fuckin' axe through his leg
Chop his head off, cause the livin' mothafuckas never seen the dead walk
'Til now, Horsemen spread his corpse across the ground
Priest pick niggas off that talk, with a pound, c'mon

[Hook: Killah Priest]
This is Horsemen Talk, Horsemen walk
Get the fuck out the way before The Horsemen stalk
We headless mothafuckas and we lacerate
Don't you know the shit could get real when you wind up smoked?

[Verse Two: Kurupt]
The headless Horsemen nigga
I'm back, give me a fired up Mac
Seventeen different satchels of uncooked crack
Dogs don't associate with cats
Horses beat niggas with metallic wiffle ball bats
If time could rewind I would have rewound before
Knocked down, surround and drowned before
Concentrated, ligaments separated
Pronounced un-hoofed with the hoofs pound
I'm Kurupt, Young Gotti, the Headless Horseman
I'm the one that started off extortion
Contortion began to spread to scorchin'
Featherweights came with the enforcements
And forced the enforcements I'm forcin'
And open the doors, let all the force in
I never really gave a fuck what it's costin'
Time ain't money cause I take my money
And I take my time when I take my money
I'm always careful when I make my money
I know about niggas gettin' quaked by money
But The Horsemen here though
Comin' through with the Hennessey and dough dough
I'm lookin' at the niggas peepin' out the hoes
I start cookin' mothafuckas like kilos

(*horses neighing*)

[Verse Three: Ras Kass]
Cock my Beanie like Anna B C, Gwen
Release the beast, G heat, creeps beneath me
Like the over fiend ET with DVD
Feasibly he see beyond 3-D
We the glitch in The Matrix
Neo - "these niggas got computer code runnin' across they faces"
Temporarily trade places
I define Hip-Hop and transcend it
Take linear time and bend it
The biggest lie ever told, ever since the 13th amendment
Was whoever told you, you could contend with men with tremendous?
For rhymin' magnum mentality, for rhymin' over instrumentals
Flow like menstrual
Mena trois menaces, murder fresh-maker like Mentos
Rock like cement, cum like semen
Judgmental demon, mad lizard
Y'all niggas is fembots
We bend blocks with big shots
And kill your little homey like Kid Rock's
I kid you not, kick rocks or kick box
I'm like a one legged man in an ass kickin' contest
You're gon' get your ass stampeded repeatedly
And immediately Hannibal Lector gon' feed it to me
Please believe what you see
Or see it to believe it
Heard men are from Mars, that's why I floss on Venus
Wipe out the species, extinct ya whole genus
So fresh and so clean this
The OutKast of rap, Horsemen attack
The only thing gon' pop is my collar and a gat

[Hook: Killah Priest]
This is +Horsemen Talk+, Horsemen walk
Get the fuck out the way before The Horsemen stalk
We headless mothafuckas and we lacerate
Don't you know the shit could get real when your ass get smoked?

[Verse Four: Canibus]
Yo, yo, yo
Fuck beggin' for ya life, I have you niggas beggin for death
Use a dull blade and sever ya neck
You're whack because I say so
In my platoon niggas like you are good for peelin' potatoes
With your manicured hands and gay flows
I murder your first born after it's only a day old
Rip the Jacker rips the track up
Rippin' rappers, eight sack, rippin' that ass up
Niggas back up when I attack with my axe up
Swingin faster than Tiger Woods at The Masters (FORE!)
I decapitate you faggots
Then gallop over ya body with a horse and carriage
Kidnap ya widow, fuck her in a wooden cabinet
Pass the pussy to Priest and let him stab it
Ask Ras and Kurupt if they wanna get at it
Laughin' like madmen, swallowin X tablets
Natural born spitters that mean business
Millennium niggas, got the Sword of Gideon wit us
And we all got a bone to pick
Niggas talkin' about frozen wrists and how much dough they get
Go to war with them like the Bosnians and Bolsheviks
Put an umbrella up they asshole and open it
While I'm still holdin' it, openin and closin' it
I break they motherfuckin' pelvic bones with it
I will sabotage, everybody knows that shit
A nigga spittin' like me ain't supposed to break
Now I got a formula that's guaranteed to work
The Horsemen, remember you heard it from me first
Four niggas that done been through it
With more knowledge than the Druids and the will power to do it
My cranium pumps uranium
My first name's Germaine so my heart probably pumps Germanium
When I die, they should have my wake in a stadium
You can witness my body beamed up by aliens
Radiation poisonin' that will probably make ya skin fall off
Motherfucker this is +Horsemen Talk+
