[Hook: The Music Luvas]
They say that I’m selfish
I only think about me, myself and I
They say that I’m selfish
Worry about me, I gotta stay fly
In case y’already didn’t know baby
In case y’already didn’t know baby

[Verse 1: King Tee]
Shinin’ bright, I’m a star for 21 years
We been buying out the bar, a alcoholic bazaar
Intoxicate the gig, that’s the main objective
The crowd can't get enough, shit, they want another swig
King Trife’s like the overdose on the coast
And DJ EFN’s the definitive host
They askin’, what’s good? Shit’s like, crazy hood
But shit, who’s crazy? Let’s get that understood
From Com Town they brought our king Tookie for the feature
Blowin’ on some type of sativa sippin’ bonita
A hundred times sweeter when the crowd gets eager
I step up in the booth, keep it a hundred proof
They call the king selfish like I’m stingy with the game
I think I’m more self-contained, let me explain
I can share my Remy, share my Henny
But that Louis the Thirteenth? The fuck y’all think

They say that I’m selfish

In case y’already didn’t know baby
In case y’already didn’t know baby

[Verse 2: Fashawn]
Far from stepped on this is pure, tap the cap twice and twist it off
The Hennesey’ll keep my liver warm
Mi amor, plenty to pour, Remy galore
Yea, Tennessee whisky or in mickys of course
40 ounce oh my noggin, 40 ounce to the noggin
On the O.E. lately, oh, who’s crazy?
Selfish with the syrup it gotten lazy
80’s baby, 90’s maybe
Show you how to drink it to the bottom of the glass
Swallow, pour a litre for the ryler who passed
Chosen few I share my champagne with
You probly should know, you ever see me pass a bottle of Mo?
They gotta be folks, familia, you know how it go
Since my first sip of scotch right outside of the store
I would sneak it off the shelf in my sneakers by the belt
Frequently and I would keep it to myself cause I’m

[Verse 3: Kurupt]
I told her picture this
Crispy nice fit, alligator, crocodile, too legit to fuckin’ quit
Heavy game, I’m just sayin’ I’m just posted
I’m just playin’ like a playa in the game
I’m just smokin’, I’m just sayin’
Picture this, bitch, I ain’t givin’ you shit
You be lucky if you get some dick, bitch
I play my game like Larry Flint
This is just the way I keep my game on crisp, bitch
This ain’t nothin’ but that D. P. ology
DPGC psychology
She asked me for a quarter and I gave her a dime
She asked me it again and I slapper her out of her mind
Wait your turn, look, the bird is the word
See bird, bird, bird make a sucker swerve
I’m so selfish, I post up and take the selfie
Bitch, cause it’s all about me
