I started off as an army brat Atten-hut! Seven months old class act I was racin' down the block As a matter of fact I coulda been a track star I guess I am I stacked bars Comin' through your system in them phat cars (uh) Cross country isn't that far It's like I'm in the race Don't know who you cats are See one day I fell from grace Landed in this place My whole shit erased From talkin' back to my momma's face  Like I was lost in space Without a trace (uh) Cuttin' class Bein' Mrs. Fast ass Gettin' blasted with dad (with my dad) Got caught up in the flash My nana gone mad Had to make a dash So I fell up in the streets Did anything for cash Did anything to crash In anybody's path Gave everything I had Took what I could grab (uh) Check it And it was just a bunch of rags

Chorus: [Kurupt]
From rags to riches Buckets to 'Lacs to switches From rags to riches Bet you I'ma be the richest We went from rags to riches Buckets to 'Lacs to switches From rags to riches Bet you I'ma be the richest

I used to have nickels and cays Back in the days The only way to get paid invade My Berrettas squeeze cheddar out of a nigga's leather My Beretta knock letters off of a nigga's sweater Back in the days I used to sit here to stick and spit In donuts Count buildin's in these shawn slicks Pierced niggas just like thorns  Kicked out of all the hardcore Me and me homies used to plot and storm Like wasp and yellow jackets used to flock the swarm We gettin' ready for the Mario Andretti award See some count sheep right before they sleep I always stayed awoke with the indo-smoke I always kept a heat with me under the sheets Before the big homie tossed me the GS3 I had a all yellow 1979 square body Volvo with a dent in the side I went from rags to riches

I remember sellin' coke Can't believe that I was poisonin' my folk Now I let my throat be the antidote  Always kept my hopes high Now mama don't cry Cuz I'll be close by With the most high I was playin' Robin Hood In the hood Little Red Riding Hood Till the barrel pointed where I stood Yeah I stood But walked away Like I was absolutely positively sure I could Attitude on fuck it Two dollars in the bucket Been schemin' steady dreamin' For the chance to make some duckets Caused a little ruckus on the sideline Fully reconstructed every guideline From the alleyway to Cali on the Grammy day Went from disarray to Mayday, mayday, mayday Ran away from the sickness With a quickness And went from rags to richness
