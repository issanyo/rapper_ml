[Problem]
When I say the B word, I say, ‘Baby, you the B word’
That’s not a bitch, that’s a beautiful lady
That’s what you are from now on
So, walk up to you and say ‘Girl, you acting like the B word’
You’re acting like a beautiful lady, but you still a bitch
When I leave, I just ain’t gon’ call you a bitch to your face no more
See, ‘cause I feel—I don’t wanna disrespect ya, you know
But I expect you to stay in your bitch mode
You kinda undersmell what I’m telling you because you feel me
You know, bitches listen to this type shit
They know, they know when they fuckin’—when they rat ass is bitches
They know it—we don’t tell ‘em, I mean it glows
It’s like when you get a new shirt or something
They put that on every day, like, you’s a bitch
I could see it once you leave, once you get up, when you wake up
You ain’t nothing but a cum spongin’ ass bitch
And you just gotta deal with it and keep moving, you feel me
‘Cause these ol’ rabbit ratchet ass hoes—“I’m a woman”
Yeah, you’s a bitch, too—you could be, you know, you feel me
I’m a nigga, I’m a man, I ain’t shit, you know
I could be all those things at once, so, you know, you can too
Bitch, just learn your personality, hoe—I mean, ‘cause I know it
Niggas know, we just let y’all fly…
