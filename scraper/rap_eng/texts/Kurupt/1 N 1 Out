[Verse 1: Kurupt]
DPG...
Kidnappings, jackings and robberies, on a mission with it
Hot pots, spots and rocks, fresh out the kitchen with it
Homicides, shootings, Colombian neckties
Face to face dumpin', random drive-bys
This is what we made of, life at the bottom
To the top of society, selection variety
Ability, to re-shape mountains to statues
To represent our lives, our pain inflictions
Remembered for all times like Greeks, Egyptians
Newports, Coronas, Indo, Henn
Focus for the future, fuck the gimmicks
Dogg Pound is forever like Mt. Olympus
Tempest, teflon'll fly from here to Memphis
Chattanooga to Boston to the CSUN campus
Camp out in your city in a G'd up camper
Nigga, Gotti McGwire, Kurupt esquire
DPG empire, pirates and vampires
Poetry is a form of positive creation
Poetry's a form of rhythmatic assassination
Words can pierce niggas, horrific and fierce, nigga, look

[Chorus: Kurupt]
1 in, 1 out
Two hammers'll show niggas what we about
I ain't got time for none of these muthafuckas
I got kids, nigga please, muthafucka
What you know about this muthafuckin' G shit?
If you know about it, then you know about this
Fuck with us, you get chipped
Dogg Pound Gangstas, we rare indeed
We got everything you want and need
Fuck with us, bitch

[Verse 2: Daz]
I'm from the Imperial family, torturing and collapsing
AK shells, trigger pulling and capping
Kidnapping, fuck a ransom, it's war time
Perhaps when you know it's mine, I'm taking no prisoners
The art of war, the score is mine
My secret's to strategize
I give a fuck who you come, muthafucka, I analyze
Don't explain nothin', nothin' to talk about
Buckle up, nigga, that's when Diggy Daz'll knock you out
Small niggas, big niggas fall when they hit they jaw
R-A-W, nigga, Daz is raw
Can't say no, the heat is on when the G is on and poppin'
On top of his pedestal, that's when the G is born
With a strap in my lap and a blunt in my mouth
Got the G's in my right hand and boy I got clout
I ain't learned this from the Boy Scouts, I learned it in the street
Dope dealer, pimps and gangstas, the DPG

[Chorus: Kurupt]
1 in, 1 out
Two hammers'll tell niggas what we about
I ain't got time for none of these muthafuckas
I got kids, nigga please, muthafucka
What you know about this muthafuckin' G shit?
If you know about it, then you know about this
Fuck with us, you get chipped
Dogg Pound Gangstas, we rare indeed
We got everything you want and need
Fuck with us, bitch

[Verse 3]
[Kurupt]
It ain't hard, come after ya, capture ya
Fire shit up like Battlestar Galactica
Have problems with everybody, I was a headache
Snoop gave me non-playa hatin' Kool-Aid to drink
Now I'm cool with everybody, got my shit together
I'm out to get it and get it, any way, however
I'm shooting torpedoes the size of buildings
I'm the juggernaut, muthafucka, nigga, was illin'...

[Daz]
We in black leathers, black steel, black niggas that kill for less
Than a hundred dollar bill, that's real
Concealed or conceal, see, the police is the crooked one
Some the sergeant, the captain, on down to the rookie ones
Streets is the same from the drugs and the gangs
It's been here for years, see, the shit won't change
I don't blame nobody for my problems
An AK, TECs and automatic revolvers
You know that gat gon' holla holla

[Chorus: Kurupt]
1 in, 1 out
Two hammers'll tell niggas what we about
I ain't got time for none of these muthafuckas
I got kids, nigga please, muthafucka
What you know about this muthafuckin' G shit?
If you know about it, then you know about this
Fuck with us, you get chipped
Dogg Pound Gangstaz, we rare indeed
We got everything you want and need
Fuck with us, bitch

[Outro: Daz]
All y'all muthafuckas out there best'a recognize, analyze
'Fore you become memorialized
