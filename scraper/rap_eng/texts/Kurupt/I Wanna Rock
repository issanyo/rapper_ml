You see i do it like I do then I do it like a rolla
The homie joe gettin posted and hangin on a corner
Goin back, forth, forth and back side
Side, side to side, we do it on this side a the map
West coast got the best smokes, dealing with sandy dokes

High up hellacopters with all the homies
My intention’s to get it all by my lonely
Murder dogs, murder hogs and all ya homies
Doin it big I’m in the gig me and D.A.Z
Snoopy over there sprawling, hall em, stall em, all em
Fallin all the way from here to spanish harlem, call em
Young Mazorotti, Gotti I keep it twerkin got the party poppin everybody jerkin
You living the dream yes indeed I am  two to the chest now call the ambulance
I’m smashing on these fools breakin all the rules
Tell em who we talkin bout and what we wanna do

Snoop Dogg chillin lookin like a million
Yeah a nigga got it amma leave it to my children
Tonight I’m on some other shit and baby lovin it
Hella fast rip that ass like the other nigga

Flaggin gold brakes that’s my truck boy

Hoes just gettin in you betta pick a bitch
Cause when I shut it down the part over with
