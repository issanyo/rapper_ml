[Intro:]
Smoke-smoke-smokin!
Fucked up mayne
E 40, Snoop Dogg, The Dogg Pound
(I’m high as fuck!)
Intoxicated, elevated
My heart just won’t calm down

[Verse 1:]
Gettin' right, smokin' on a burrito wrapped tight
Up there, sittin' on the edge of the moon like Mac Tonight
Key, show me in the Bible where it say you can’t smoke weed, proceed
Inhale, exhale blow donut signs with the smoke, choke
Breathe (breathe), follow my lead, [?], hydroponic leaves
Spinach, broccoli, greens, life is much better than it seems
Kinda feel like I got wings
At the piz-party [?] off of this smelly
I'm tryin' to get her to do some things
Got a 2 liter bottle a Sprite an a fifth of that there Landy
And a non-smoker sweet red Dixie cup for a ashtray
Towels up under the door so don’t put the smoke detector out but Here come Hector the ho' protector security tryin' to kick us out
Sayin' we talkin' hella loud, warnin' me an ma guests (guests)
Told us we gotta leave if there’s one more complaint at the front desk
Smokin' an drinkin' is what I does, I don’t know about you
But imagine wakin' up in the mornin' with nothin' else to do (nothin else to do)
Bitch!

[Chorus:]
What you sippin' on, so faded
What you smokin' on, so faded
Intoxicated, elevated
My heart just won’t calm down

[Verse 2:]
A Rikki-Tikki-Tembo, we got that indo
Right from the intro, nope that's pretendo
Mi no comprendo, back out my Benzo
A/C on 71, I let the wind blow
Trunk bumpin' that shit
My big cousin Earl he keep a cup of that shit
See I been tryna roll tryna ride while I step on a slide
While I reppin that, mothafuckin west side
That’s where we come from, sling shots, marbles an double dutch
I keep two guns so they call me double clutch
Pop three, yatsi, Carlos Rossi, Earl hit Calvin den he round up d posse
Set it off, let it off,pow-pow,like Indians we had a big pow wow
We got da alcohol, we got d vegetables
Original, magical, mystical, twisted pal

[Chorus]

[Verse 3:]
I’m high, I’m tryna get grounded
Bonkin dat new shit, alumni drownin
Everythang around me, stop at d light I’m stuck, I can’t help it I’m high as fuck
Dibble dabble wit d kush an I mix it up wit d acid I roll it up in d blanket, I hit it an look at Daz
Like damn dat shit is bombin
I’m faded, only in Cali dese are legal, we medicated
I’m so elevated, so so levitated
Toe down from d floor up, you know I’m culptivated
Equal it all out, forty grams on d scale, sixty bout to switch dis out it’s time to inhale inhale
Smokin on dem swishies, for ma niggas an bitches
You know who got dat bom bom, we, so come get wid us
Huff, puff in d sky an I can’t come down, high as a mothafucka it’s E 40 an Dogg Pound (pow)

[Chorus]
