Me just waan hold a vibe and sing
Everybody done know we ah the hottest thing
Dance hall me a chat then my phone ah ring
It ah the gal in charge of me accounting
She say kaskatee yuh can keep ballin'
Got me feeling like i'm on the court Lebronin
Everyway me go its champagne 'til morning
If me spend 10k twenty just gone in
Darkroom lets turn it up a notch
Its full speed ahead we not coming off the clutch
You know me own everything me touch
Yuh say yuh badder than me me never heard such
If yuh say mi nah buss den you talk to much
When yuh cross my path its a disaster watch
Dem a bare badmind still dem nah nuh match
Mi build my brand everthing from scratch
We ah the winning team we on slam
And we about to pop off dagram
Blaqrose bring me a watering can
Cuz dis microphone just catch a fyah in me hand
