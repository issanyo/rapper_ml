Will you catch me if I fall down?
If I fall down
Will you catch me?
If I fall
[x2]
Kicked out of the womb he was forgotten
Step child exiled and then adopted
Cold feet beneath these sheets of cotton
Can't sleep his stomach keeps talking
Passed around from New York to Boston
New school, no family wants him
In the church he prays to God often
Says a prayer with his hands raised calling
Will you catch me if I fall down?
If I fall down
Will you catch me?
If I fall
[x2]
Take this curse out of me
Pull me out of this dream
I need a Saviour tonight
He was a legend in the streets of Compton
No police or brigade could stop him
Hell's Angel out the clouds and fallen
Spent years in a world of Sodom
No prison or family wants him
Born a vagabond losing his conscience
Just a kid turned into a monster
Another lost one calling for father
Will you catch me if I fall down?
If I fall down
Will you catch me?
If I fall
[x2]
Take this curse out of me
Pull me out of this dream
I need a Saviour tonight
The sun will come out tomorrow
The dark will run from the day
You pulled me out of my sorrows
When you call out my name
Will you catch me if I fall down?
If I fall down
Will you catch me?
If I fall
Will you catch me if I fall down?
If I fall down
Will you catch me?
If I fall down
Take this curse out of me
Pull me out of this dream
I need a Saviour tonight
