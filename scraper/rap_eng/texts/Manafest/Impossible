Intro:
Crying and hiding this feeling
Running and fighting for freedom

Verse 1:
This is the last time, I'll cry lullabies
All night can't sleep I hear the floors creek
I feel shadows in my room
My friends find another bruise
I'm a end up on the news
I just don't know what to do
God I'm calling you
Send an angel, send two
I want a move but I'm trapped in the outer room
I know you hear me, clearly I'm weary
Come and fill me with your power, heal me

Hook (Trevor Mcnevan):
It seems impossible for me to let this go
Feel like an animal, I'm ready to lose control
Take everything you need, take every part of me
Give me some room to breathe, before I lose control

Chorus:
I gotta get away
Gotta break away
Save Me
Gotta find away
Gotta break the chains
Take me
Before I lose Control
Before I lose Control
It seems impossible
It's not impossible

Bridge (Trevor Mcnevan):
I'm tired so tired of walking through this fire
If you want to find me I'll be here in my room
I'm thinking you're drinking
Need to get out before you start swinging
Wish I could show you all the pain inside me

Interlude:
It seems impossible
Crying and hiding this feeling
Running and fighting for freedom
For me to loose control
Crying and hiding this feeling
Running and fighting for freedom

I'm so tired a walking this line through the fire
If you want to find me I'm in my room retired
Hiding this feeling I'm thinking you're drinking
Sinking deep ducking under your swinging, out a commission
Living cold day's hallways filled with the mistakes
Wish I could show you all the pain inside it's caused me
It used to be a house, a home now it's neither yo
So I'm leaving with the cross strapped to my soul
