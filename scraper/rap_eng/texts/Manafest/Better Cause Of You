Verse I

Mr. Manafest is back
Fists up in the air attack
This the year I almost cracked
Souvenir among the pack
Tour around because of rap
Wind me up and let me smash
Take me home and put me in
Turn me on and hear me sing
Post my picture on your wall
Read about me on the blog
Go online and get my songs
Buy them all and party on
Yo!!!!!
I won't be the one to fall
Follow me I carry on
Hit you like a sabotage
Kick it like I'm at a park

Get em off, get me lost
Hide me in this room and lock
The door and toss the key away
I'd rather be alone "okay"

A stow away, go away
Can't you see, don't bother me
Get out or I'm gonna freak

Chorus:
Hey I need a place
To get composure

Now I need, your face
To get me over

Unbelievable how I stay sober

I can feel Alive
I'm better cause of you

Verse II

Round and round I tour the globe
Show to show, I flip the flow
I sip a soda hit the sauna
Chilling sober still a soldier
Sister, mother, fatal father
Fist to sin I finish farther

It's like I'm treading water
Sinking and it's getting darker
Mr. Mana needs to manage his anger
His tantrums going bananas
Its random hands in a panic
He's standing
Ramping up to blow up
The gold rush, is so hush
Yo know what
I think I've had enough
Pull me up
I'm getting out here
I'm out of control
Fear has taken it's toll
I'm going back to my home
Follow me if you want
It's not easy I warn
But it gets results baby
Won't you leave me alone
Oh

Chorus:
Hey I need a place
To get composure

Now I need, your face
To get me over

Unbelievable how I stay sober

I can feel Alive
I'm better cause of you

BRIDGE:
I act like I don't know you
I crash you're the first I go to
When I'm down and feeling alone
"I'M BETTER OFF WITH YOU"

I act like I don't know you
I crash you're the first I go to
When I'm down and feeling alone
"I'M BETTER OFF WITH YOU"

Chorus Repeats
