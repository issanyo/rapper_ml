[Verse 1:]
Startup kid with the cool, cool kicks
With the new newest music off the lid
Came from the co cold, with a cold
Melting pot landed on the stove, oh
Drove up to buffalo in my black echo
Filled up with petrol never say hello
To boarder patrol, they stare from there nose
We made through, oh
Good bye Ontario
I got dreams cuz
That’s the real buzz

[Chorus:]
Start up kid
Start up kid chic, chic, chic, chish
Start up kid with the million dollar dream
Understand things aren’t always what it seems
Start up kid let me put ye on my team
Gonna go far gonna baby make it you and me
Start up kid
Start up kid chic, chic, chic, chish
Start up kid with the million dollar dream
Understand things aren’t always what it seems
Start up kid let me put ye on my team
Gonna go far gonna baby make it you and me

[Verse 2:]
Hollywood here we go was eating cheerios
Now I got organic milk on my cereal
I’m getting healthy sold cards delt me
Up for second helpings I’m drowning don’t help me
It’s, it’s got a make your heart, beat, beap
If it’s not real don’t trade it for a cheap dream
I’m being me, obedient peace to vc
Vision city girl check it out that’s you and me
Every single day I’m waking up and I do pray
Every little way making up for the old days
Start up kid’s not kidding
Got a get it to give again, again I got to edit
Study everything I’m indebted
To give a message
Credit to the god the heavens

Touch that rim I’m out on a lim

[Chorus:]
Start up kid chic, chic, chic, chish
