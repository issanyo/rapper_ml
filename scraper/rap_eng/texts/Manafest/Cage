[Verse 1:]
I left the cage and
I broke the rules
Kept my name am I a fool, I a fool
Wrong way you’d say to me
Won’t make it was just the fuel
Just the fuel
I needed to push away, who’s the first to cave
You were just a slave, I won’t suffocate
I just contemplate, who’s here today?
(I sign my name)
Don’t mess with the moscot yo I’m like a tesla
No gas, phantom and some
Faith bred, faith anthem
Fade after 5 gransons
Got time still handsome
Don’t know who your playing with
Who you talking to, what you think this is
I pay no mind to a shaky eye
If the darkness comes
Then my light will shine

[Chorus:]
This cage is too small to hold me (to hold me)
Nothing you could pay to own me(own me)
This cage is too small to hold me (hold me)
Nothing you could pay to own me
I’m breaking out this cage
I’m breaking out this cage
I’m breaking out this cage
I’m breaking out this cage
I’m breaking out this cage

[Verse 2:]
Fast forward and am I free now
I’m free now
Put you fe fe fe feeet down
Freak out
Let my chest breathe out
Feel how
The lungs in hale, exhale
Peace now
Blue vase go getter, goal setter
Soul saved, drop the vendetta
Said I’d never make it
Can’t trace this fake this
Always gonna miss if you’re aimless
Take two let me ace this
1st place not vacant some took the money
I waited
Jumped the bar then I raised it
Paid my dues dejavu am I the fool
Don’t know who your playing with
Who you talking to what you think this is
I pay no mind to a shaky eye if the darkness comes
Then my light will shine

[Chorus]

[Bridge:]
Don’t let your dreams die out in the day light
Won’t live my life in the shadows
And if there’s no wrong way you can do right
Then I won’t live my life in the shadows

[Chorus]
