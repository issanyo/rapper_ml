[Verse 1]
You're underneath the waves and wind
You hold your breath as the ocean pulls you in
You feel you're drowning and no one knows
You hold your tongue cause you think you're all alone (you're not alone)
But don't listen to the voices in your mind
You're not going crazy, it'll be alright
You don't have to fear what's up ahead

[Chorus]
Cause I'll be the light at the end of your tunnel
And you'll walk away from the grave of your sorrow
And I'll be your sight when your eyes are blind
As sure as the sun coming after the darkest night
You're gonna rise
You're gonna rise

[Verse 2]
You hide your scars cause you're ashamed
But it's okay to admit you're not okay
You wanna be healed, but don't know where to start
When you feel like a body with a broken heart
Some days are more than you can take

[Chorus]
Cause I'll be the light at the end of your tunnel
And you'll walk away from the grave of your sorrow
And I'll be your sight when your eyes are blind
As sure as the sun coming after the darkest night
You're gonna rise
You're gonna rise

[Bridge]
I'll help you make your escape
I'll be the breath you can't take
I'll the fire that will light the way and lead you home
I'll help you make your escape
I'll be the breath you can't take
I'll the fire that will light the way and lead you home

[Refrain]
Cause I'll be the light at the end of your tunnel
And you'll walk away from the grave of your sorrow

[Chorus]
Cause I'll be the light at the end of your tunnel
And you'll walk away from the grave of your sorrow
And I'll be your sight when your eyes are blind
As sure as the sun coming after the darkest night
You're gonna rise (at the end of your [?])
You're gonna rise (from the grave of my [?])
And I'll be your sight when your eyes are blind
You're gonna rise
You're gonna rise
