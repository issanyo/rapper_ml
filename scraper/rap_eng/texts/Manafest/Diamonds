Cause I know
Diamonds aren't the only thing
That shines
And I know
Love can make the darkness sing

[Verse 1]
I throw myself out my own house
Couldn't stop myself
So I just walked out
Almost did it again
Spoke too soon
Called a couple of friends
Blood boiled over
I'll be cool in a minute
Kicked a few things
That's enough are you finished
Heart in Hand
Calm as I walk in the door
Hold my breath
When I let out a roar
Even good men need a little grace
Put the world down and I pick up faith
Only scared boys try to save face
Pride in the mouth, it's a bitter taste
Spit it out
Don't want it, Don't need it
Put it down and I just leave it
But I keep hearing it talk to me
Knows what I'm thinking like its on to me
Hold my breath when its hard to breathe


[Chorus: Teerawk]
Cause I know
Diamonds aren't the only thing
That shines
And I know
Love can make the darkness sing
(x2)

[Verse 2]
I need a strong tower
Will power no coward
Take back the flowers, sell the casket
My soul's established
Found a passage
Strike the matches
Light my black and white the sky
Wipe my fears, redeem the time
The bathroom mirror, I'm eye to eye
Look inside my soul and try to talk
To the guy if he's still alive
Pinch myself, try not to cry
Walking by the sea of a great divide
Left my print, I still survived
Is this the one?
My time is now
My Moment jump and leave the crowd
Walking with a king
I'm tall and proud
Standing reborn
Got the victor's crown

[Chorus: Teerawk]
Cause I know
Diamonds aren't the only thing
That shines
And I know
Love can make the darkness sing
(x2)

[Bridge: Teerawk]
I no longer have to wait
For the spark that covers me
Its a stand for me to take
It's not a wand that we can wave
Its the faith like a child that counts when
I try to do what I think I feel is right
But it's never been something I control
Its so hard to commit when I don't know
Its the faith like a child that counts when
I try to do what I think I feel is right
But it's never been something I control
Its so hard to commit when I don't know

[Chorus: Teerawk]
Cause I know
Diamonds aren't the only thing
That shines
And I know
Love can make the darkness sing
(x2)
