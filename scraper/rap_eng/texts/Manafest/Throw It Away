Wasted
Faded
How did we get so jaded?
Hollow
Tomorrow
We can't just throw it away

Woke up, choked up in my sleep
A piece of me drifts away
Not just a melt down, say you want to leave now
Can't believe how you left just to watch me drown
Come and pick up your things
Before it goes up in flames
Where did I go wrong?
Pacing up all night long
Singing my sad song
Married to a time bomb

(What am I suppose to do?)

We got to pull ourselves together
Nothing lasts forever
Pull ourselves together
Move on now or never

Wasted
Faded
How did we get so jaded?
Hollow
Tomorrow
We can't just throw it away
We can't just throw it away

Every time I try to forget
My memory just won't erase

Can't escape, I'm a wreck, I can't sleep
Can't stopping drinking haven't slept in 3 weeks
I don't hate you no I you I don't
But won't pretend its ok
Hate me waste me with every lie
But we can't go back this is our life
