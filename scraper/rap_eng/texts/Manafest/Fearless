[Chorus: Alicia Simila]
Without a doubt in my mind
Through shadows I climb
Put it all on the line
I'm fearless, fearless
(2x)

[Verse 1: Manafest]
Please don't judge me now
I'm only human
Burned every bridge down
I keep it cruising
No more class clown
Still a student
Not your average in town
Just a tourist
I had room to grow
Look out below
Here I come jumping stairs
In my shell toes
The devils elbow I skate on him
Crush bones
Keep my tempo locked
Cause God knows
I need Him, need Him now
More then I did back then
Stick closer then a friend
Dad, I wish you here
To share in my fears and dreams through the years
My kids coming but you'll never see her
Your idea of leaving too soon
Spot lighted full mon
I lead the pack
With the world on my back
Our families in tact
Thank Jesus for that

[Chorus: Alicia Simila]
Without a doubt in my mind
Through shadows I climb
Put it all on the line
I'm fearless, fearless
(2x)

[Verse 2: Manafest]
Slaying a dragon
Live in a mansion
Dreams that I imagine
Loading them in a canon
Look what I've become
I'll never be the same
I know I'm gonna change
With wisdom & age
The badge on my arm says our freedoms at stake
My past is a fog and I'm walking away
My child is alive with my DNA
Faith never froze, dipped it in gold
I still got a fight in me, lots of life in me
Stop micen me, lion is ripe in me
Fly a kite with me, skies the limit
Living my dreams with no fear in it

[Chorus: Alicia Simila]
Without a doubt in my mind
Through shadows I climb
Put it all on the line
I'm fearless, fearless
(2x)

[Bridge: Manfest]
It's been so long since I've been gone
Feels so good to be back home
Face myself I'm not alone
I'm fearless, fearless
It's been so long since I've been gone
Feels so good to be back home
Face myself I'm not alone
I'm fearless

[Chorus: Alicia Simila]
Without a doubt in my mind
Through shadows I climb
Put it all on the line
I'm fearless, fearless
(2x)
