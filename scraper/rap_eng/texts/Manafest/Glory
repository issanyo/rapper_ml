Sometimes I don't even wanna leave my house
These fake fears wrestle me to the flipping ground
I'm not scared of dying maybe scared of failing
So I stop trying evil thoughts start prevailing
There's a devil out there seeking to take me out
I see him in my nightmares when I scream and shout
Even though it's a dream it sure feels real
I know I got an angel watching in the rear near
In the midst of triumph seems there's a tragedy
I know I've won even though they want to battle me
Adamantly down on my knees pray fervently
White hot never stop till I'm in the heavenly'

So beautiful so powerful, so wonderful
Undeniable you you you are, you you, you are, you are you are
So beautiful so powerful, omnipotent
Undeniable you you you are, you you, you are, you are you are

There's something different, magnificent
About these Christians who talk and live in this
Lifestyle of putting pride down, it hasn't died out
It's widely spread out and I
Can't deny its power, people getting healed every hour
How do we explain this, cure for aids and patients?
They said he wouldn't walk now he's racing, tell me what's changing
I'm pointing fingers at the sky
Cause some things I can't deny no matter if I try
I'm a walk in faith
Cause I can see you even if it's not your face
You Are

So beautiful so powerful, so wonderful
Undeniable you you you are, you you, you are, you are you are
So beautiful so powerful, omnipotent
Undeniable you you you are, you you are, you are you are

Glory and honor the father we'll give him
The glory and honor the father rejoice in him

I've read a lot of books, turned all sorts of pages
But only one where the letters all illuminated
It's like it's jumping out at me speaking right to me
You see right through me there's no fooling
I can't hide from you why do I hide under?
Lies come I stutter cry out I love ye
The greatest gift so many are oblivious
You sent your kid to die only so that I could live
They bringing me down you lifting me up
I'm living your word hearing your sound, feeling a rush
Just the way I am, come as you are
Don't change a thing, use a superstar
