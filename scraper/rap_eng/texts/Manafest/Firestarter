[Chorus]
I wanna be a firestarter
You can help me if you wanna
We can spread and make the whole world light up
Light up, light up

[Verse 1]
I've never been the one to blaze a path
But I've never been the type
That just gets walked all over
I don't normally overreact
But I just can't sit here waiting
For someone to initiate it

[Pre-Chorus]
I won't sit back and watch it waste away

[Chorus]
I wanna be a firestarter
You can help me if you wanna
We can spread and make the whole world light up
Light up, light up
I wanna be a firestarter
Put it higher, put it hotter
We can spread and make the whole world light up
Light up, light up

[Verse 2]
Do the right thing and don't look back
They can judge me, but they won't ever suffocate me
I can see through the truth and all the lies
You can tell me it's not worth fighting
But I've seen it, I believe it

[Pre-Chorus]
I won't stand by and watch it waste away

[Chorus]
I wanna be a firestarter
You can help me if you wanna
We can spread and make the whole world light up
Light up, light up
I wanna be a firestarter
Put it higher, put it hotter
We can spread and make the whole world light up
Light up, light up

[Bridge]
I'll be the one left standing (hey)
I won't be caught here stranded (no)
It don't matter what they say
It all just falls to the floor
We've got it
I'll be the one left standing (hey)
I won't be caught here stranded (no)
It don't matter what they say
It all just falls to the floor

[Refrain]
I wanna be a firestarter, starter, starter
We can spread and make the whole world light up
Light up, light up

[Chorus]
I wanna be a firestarter
You can help me if you wanna
We can spread and make the whole world light up
Light up, light up
I wanna be a firestarter
Put it higher, put it hotter
We can spread and make the whole world light up
Light up, light up

[Outro]
I wanna be a firestarter, starter, starter
We can spread and make the whole world light up
Light up, light up
