[Verse 1:]
I tried to play it your way
Not a fair fight
Tried to see it your way
You’re scared of heights
Closing every door way
Keep the key tight
Just another story
So I’m like
Guess I can go
I’m getting the gull
I know
I can’t be wrong
The feeling is strong
I won’t
Tug on your arm
I promise I’m gone
I’ve grown
I wasn’t born to be
A slave
I’ve got to go

[Chorus:]
My way, my way
My way, my way
The fuse is lighting up
I know I got to go
My way, my way
My way, my way
I’m jumping of the bus
I know I got to go
My way, my way, my way
Before it’s too late

[Verse 2:]
I won’t play the victim
Too smart for that
Jumped out the system
Wrote my own map
Praying for some wisdom
A lot of shady traps
Take the time to listen
Carve my own path
Guess I can go
I’m getting the gull
I know
I can’t be wrong
The feeling is strong
I won’t
Tug on your arm
I promise I’m gone
I’ve grown
I wasn’t born to be
A slave
I’ve got to go

[Chorus:]
My way, my way
My way, my way
The fuse is lighting up
I know I got to go
My way, my way
My way, my way
I’m jumping of the bus
I know I got to go
My way, my way, my way
My way
The fuse is lighting up
I know I got to go
My way, my way
My way
Before it’s too late

[Bridge:]
Guess I can go
I’m getting the gull
I know
I can’t be wrong
The feeling is strong
I won’t
Tug on your arm
I promise I’m gone
I’ve grown
I wasn’t born to be
A slave
I’ve got to go

[Chorus]
