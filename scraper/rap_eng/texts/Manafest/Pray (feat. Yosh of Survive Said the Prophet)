[Verse 1]
If last night was crazy, what you said today shakes me
How can you like fake it and not get all jaded?
Trips me out man, but I'm here for you
After longs nights, you're talkin' spiritual, I'm waitin' for a miracle
Cryin' in my arms and the DJ's out of songs
Drive ya to your mom's and I'm tryna stay calm
Thinking of a verse or the words I can say
But I turn on the radio and try to play it safe

[Pre-Chorus]
I used to walk this road alone
I used to fight with sticks and stones
But now I know what I believe
This battle's won on my knees

[Chorus: Yosh]
I pray, even when the lights go out
And the darkest cloud tries to hold me down
I pray, even when I don't know why
And my hands feel tired, I'm afraid at night
I pray
Prayin' for the sun
Prayin' to the One
Prayin', "Won't You come?"
I pray
I'm not givin' up, no
I pray

[Verse 2]
I'm not sleepin', not dreamin', start weepin'
Voices in my head got me kneelin' by the bed
Flippin' through pages, thinking how you faded
God send an angel, forever all you faithful (You are)
Let 'em find grace, find his way to see Your face
Let 'em come alive, be healed, and not die (that's right)
I'm standing in faith in the power of Your name
No one's ever too far gone, they can change

[Pre-Chorus]
I used to walk this road alone
I used to fight with sticks and stones
But now I know what I believe
This battle's won on my knees

[Chorus: Yosh]
I pray, even when the lights go out
And the darkest cloud tries to hold me down
I pray, even when I don't know why
And my hands feel tired, I'm afraid at night
I pray
Prayin' for the sun
Prayin' to the One
Prayin', "Won't You come?"
I pray
I'm not givin' up, no
I pray

[Verse 3]
Seven months have passed, I got a call from dad
He said your doing fine and got a stable 9 to 5
I heard your in church and met a girl at work
I knew you'd turn around, sometimes I had my doubts (yea)
Dang, I'm so proud, if only mom could see you now
I'm wiping my tears cuz I know God hears (hears)
Every prayer in faith, it's the mercy and grace (that's right)
I know our legacy will never be the same

[Chorus: Yosh]
I pray, even when the lights go out
And the darkest cloud tries to hold me down
I pray, even when I don't know why
And my hands feel tired, I'm afraid at night
I pray
Prayin' for the sun
Prayin' to the One
Prayin', "Won't You come?"
I pray
I'm not givin' up, no
I pray
