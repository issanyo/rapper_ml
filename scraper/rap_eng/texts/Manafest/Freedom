(Intro)
I chose to die
The most high knows the worlds lies
They keep it organized
Wanna fight 'til your cross eyed
(Hook)
I stand for the righteous in christ
Middle of a crisis
Sent to God man freedom fighters
I stand for the righteous in christ
Middle of a crisis
Sent to God man freedom fighters
I stand for the righteous in christ
Middle of a crisis
Sent to God man freedom fighters
(Verse 1)
Yo freedom of choice knowledge is
I share the voice where my father sits
In the book to find authorship
Positive, provocative, I gotta live
Stand rock solid in the land of the opposite
Militant from lines in militia
Revelate enigma it's a dusk vs gorillas
Still I third eye stand like a pillar
World eyes pass by man like a stigma
I ain't alive from a mantic so mans wild
Genocide for the Christian souls suicide
This stations fragrance is hatred complacent evasion
Nothing like that truth in the basement
(Hook)
I stand righteous in christ
Middle of a crisis
Sent to God man freedom fighters
I stand righteous in christ
Middle of a crisis
Sent to God man freedom fighters
(Bridge)
Spirit of the lord
There is freedom
With the spirit of the lord
There is freedom
(Verse 2)
Don't try to tell me what's right
I fight for his right
It's christ back like a thing from the night
I don't care if you black or white with mixed asian
Seems  patience we all gonna face him
First all we all caught on the same ship
Never nameless I speak what his name is
I couldn't abide by the rules
I'd rather skateboard with an attitude
And dropped out of high school
It's possible my minds been effected
I've never been molested
I live my life and I don't regret it
Vigilantes spare they [?] for God
Better take the law leaving scars on the boulevard
Visualize, stabilize my emotions
My opponents for the quest I was chosen
Deliverance speaking truth with a chalice
Hold my cup high till my dust hits the ashes
(Hook)
I stand righteous in christ
Middle of a crisis
Sent to God man freedom fighters
I stand righteous in christ
Middle of a crisis
Sent to God man freedom fighters
(Interlude)
*mumbling*
(Hook)
Ay yo
I stand righteous in christ
Middle of a crisis
Sent to God man freedom fighters
I stand righteous in christ
Middle of a crisis
Sent to God man freedom fighters
I stand righteous in christ
Middle of a crisis
Sent to God man freedom fighters
I stand righteous in christ
Middle of a crisis
Sent to God man freedom fighters
