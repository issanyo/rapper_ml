I see red but I'm not even stopping
Speed ahead put a nail in my coffin
Resurrect and see a dead man walking
Tie me up 'cause I think that I've lost it

My halo's on but it's faded I've fallen
Missing pieces keep proceeding with caution
St. Peter hold the door 'cause I'm coming
Sweet Jesus, so tired of running

Wake up, we're moving way too fast
It's hard to see the ground
When you're flying at the speed of sound
Hold on we got to get this back on track
Before we lose it or before we have a heart attack

My eyes flicker in a mirror of anger
Hanging on by a thread for an answer
In stocks I'm a slave to the lender
I can't exit outta here like I entered

The under taker prosecutes to convict me
The devil's waiting in the river to sink me
Rain drops fall hark to your mercy
God's knocking on my door to forgive me

Wake up, we're moving way too fast
It's hard to see the ground
When you're flying at the speed of sound
Hold on we got to get this back on track
Before we lose it or before we have a heart attack

I'm done with playing with fire
Fed up with playing the liar
I've lived the hard way for too long
Save me from this heart attack

I feel my heart beat slowing down
Clocks ticking time is running out
There's still a spark alive in me
I'm not ready to leave

Wake up, we're moving way too fast
It's hard to see the ground
When you're flying at the speed of sound
Hold on we got to get this back on track
Before we lose it or before we have a heart attack

I'm done with playing with fire
Fed up with playing the liar
I've lived the hard way for too long
Save me from this heart attack

Save me from this heart attack
Save me from this heart attack
