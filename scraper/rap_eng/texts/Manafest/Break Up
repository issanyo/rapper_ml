Chorus
It's a break up oh no
Ahhhh She's from Venus and I'm from Mars
It's a break up oh no
Ahhh She's from Venus and I'm from Mars
I try to understand it
But I'm just not from her planet, dang it

It's a break up oh no
Ahhhh She's from Venus and I'm from Mars
It's a break up oh no
Ahhh She's from Venus and I'm from Mars
Don't call my house, don't call my house
It ain't working out, it ain't working out

Verse I
You see that girl over there man, watch it
She'll take you out like an electric socket
She's the type of girl that's on the move
When you fall in love she's like it's over dude
You ever hear that song girls ain't nothing but trouble
She's that one that'll bust your bubble
Make you stumble take you under
Wonder why you said I love her
Lust is so blind sometimes to the eyes
Love is so fine brings peace to the mind
We don't talk cause she text me all the time
I don't stalk cause I'm not that type a guy
She says I love my Xbox a little too much
I say woe easy girl on the make up
Say what, you really want to break up
Yo girl you need to chill and just wake up

CHORUS:
It's a break up oh no
Ahhhh She's from Venus and I'm from Mars
It's a break up oh no
Ahhh She's from Venus and I'm from Mars
I try to understand it
But I'm just not from her planet, dang it
It's a break up oh no
Ahhhh She's from Venus And I'm from Mars
It's a break up oh no
Ahhh She's from Venus And I'm from Mars
Don't call my house, don't call my house
It ain't working out, it ain't working out
Verse II
And I know we just fought last night, But ah
Can we squash it, you still love me right
You're not talking come on say something
Come on girl friend, stop that fronting
I'd never hit ye, a man don't hit a girl
My world has stopped for your baby
I've learned I'm not just to say things
Words hurt and I know I'm guilty
Forgive me, cause I've cut you deeply
This seasons changing ain't it
You're leaving in your spaceship
My one and not my favorite
Call me I'll be waiting
Call me I'll be waiting

Chorus Repeats

Bridge:
Ladies are from Venus
(That's a long, long way from mars)
So help us dear Jesus
(Does she love me or does she love my car)
I try to understand but I'm just a simple man

Verse III

Don't pretend like you don't know
You know, what you said on the phone
No, no no, you didn't got me tripping
I guess were just way too different
People and I got to go now
Please don't call me at my house
My heart is broke in two halves
One smashed the other in re-hab
My bad, my cash, can't buy love
You tricked me, kissed me with hugs
One love, One God, one day
We'll understand each other just maybe!!!
