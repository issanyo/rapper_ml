Turn this up till the speakers pop
And it hits you in the chest like a thousand watts
Cause when it gets going, it's hard to stop
Just like a bull in a china shop
Turn this up till the speakers pop
And it hits you in the chest like a thousand watts
Cause when it gets going, it's hard to stop
Just like a bull in a china shop
You think it was the auto-boy
The way I'm driving songs
This dude's in my blind spot
C'mon, get off!
My iPhone's plugged in
Cruizin' at a hundred
Hitting roadkill, four wills, thirty dozen
Don't say I told ya
Rolled on the shoulder
Cop pulls me over
"Kid, are you sober?"
Loaded
