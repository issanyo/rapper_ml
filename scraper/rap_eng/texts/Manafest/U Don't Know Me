[Verse 1]
Freestyle's and Hooks, exiled like crooks
Baggy jeans my style judge by the looks
Shook by parliament I mean society I in me starting this riot up inside of me
I could buy my own suit and switch up my Tim Boots
The funny thing is I make more money than you do
So classify me as a backpacker manufactured
I'll spit on the mic to spite your laughter
I'm only young once what's your rush
In God I trust don't mold me I'll never adjust
I think you've got the wrong person
So what makes a bad person rappin' cursing skating rappin hurting
Who's a Saint? I'm still learning
So take me to the hospital or just check yourself
You got enough wood in your eye to make a shelf
Can't say I ain't done it, judged or got blunted
Next time confronted I'll shine my boxers out in public

[Hook]
You don't even know me you don't know me (echo)
So insecure I guess you judging me (echo)
I'm not the type of guy that wants exceptenence
Not influenced by what people say

[Verse 2]
It's not that I want your respect or need feel except
Through God I got rest I see you do reject
Huh, looking at me like you know me
Judge me by my clothing skeptical, and all knowing
Step in a room now a days and all eye brows raise
Is it my sexy face or my messy hair state
(I hope it's) it must be the spirit on me saved by grace
Know apology constantly around like monopoly
Courtesy of your ignorance, and people looking different
I stay diligent, and tell my story over instruments
I'm not your average adolescence arrogant or disrespecting parents
Hold your tongue in, say nothing ye mumbling the alphabet
Not accurate a false package I otta charge ye for harassment
So the next time I purchase clothes or someone serves me
I'm showing love why don't you, show me some courtesy

Chorus

[Verse 3]
I still remember this occasion
Back when I was teenaging raging like I lack the patience
Walk into a mall for a purchase
Store clerk looking kind a nervous all hawk eyed, and merciless
Chill for a second what you dealing with
I wasn't gonna steal it you freaking all serious
Easy on the judgment you gone blown your trumpet, kid looking rugged
Think I'm tripping on some substance
It's not your fault you were born that way
Gone astray thinking ever child teen's a renegade
Let me shed some light on your blindness open up your iris
Ya hinis don't check the black or the whiteness
It' all about equality word if you follow me
Love your neighbor as yourself what! That's my policy

Chorus
