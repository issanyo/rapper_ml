[Verse 1]
Shipwrecked in Toronto
Left my heart in the waves of the west coast
Stopped dreaming cause I wake up every time
Mama's taking photos
I got frame after frame of the high notes
Flipped through all the times I felt alive

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm not counting the days
I'm not loosing my faith

[Chorus]
This is my pain, this is my cry
This is my hope when I need a sign
Cause I'm never too far
Never too far to comeback
I've been so high, been so low
But no matter how long the road
I'm never too far
Never too far to comeback
So I'm coming back
I'm coming back

[Verse 2]
Hit pause and my world froze
Watch it all play back in a slo-mo
Keep trying, but I just can't press rewind
Forgetting all the regrets, reset
Found my peace of mind
It's good to be back in paradise
Cause I'm

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm not counting the days
I'm not loosing my faith

[Chorus]
This is my pain, this is my cry
This is my hope when I need a sign
Cause I'm never too far
Never too far to comeback
I've been so high, been so low
But no matter how long the road
I'm never too far
Never too far to comeback
So I'm coming back
I'm coming back
You know I'm coming back
Yeah, I'm coming back
You know I'm coming back

[Bridge]
I'm not counting the days (I'm not counting the days)
I'm not loosing my faith (I'm not loosing my faith)
(2x)

[Refrain]
This is my pain, this is my cry
This is my hope when I need a sign
Cause I'm never too far
Never too far to comeback
I've been so high, I've been so low
But I'm never too far
Never too far to comeback (so I'm coming back)

[Chorus]
This is my pain, this is my cry
This is my hope when I need a sign
Cause I'm never too far
Never too far to comeback
I've been so high, been so low
But no matter how long the road
I'm never too far
Never too far to comeback
So I'm coming back
