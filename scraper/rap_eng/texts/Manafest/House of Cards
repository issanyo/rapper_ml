[Verse 1]
I missed it again, when will this ever end?
I'm messing it up, everything that I touch
Losing my shot, 'cause time never stops
There goes my chance, slips through my hands
I'm not okay, I can't escape
Will I, will I

[Pre-Chorus]
Fall before I fly
Choke before I rhyme
Die before my time
Fail before I climb, no

[Chorus]
Sabotage, house of cards
On my knees I pray to God
I don't wanna live like this
I refuse to call it quits

[Verse 2]
Done screwing it up, still a pain in my gut
Back on my feet, never missing a beat
Risking it all, least I'm back to a crawl
I walked alone, a lonely road
I found a friend, it's not the end
Will I, will I

[Pre-Chorus]
Fall before I fly
Choke before I rhyme
Die before my time
Fail before I climb, no

[Chorus]
Sabotage, house of cards
On my knees I pray to God
I don't wanna live like this
I refuse to call it quits

[Bridge]
Crawl before I walk
Walk before I run
Run before I sprint
Know that I'm not done
(Won't)
Fall before I fly
(Don't)
Choke before I rhyme
(Can't)
Die before my time, huh
Fail before I climb, no

[Chorus]
Sabotage, house of cards
On my knees I pray to God
I don't wanna live like this
I refuse to call it quits
Hit the wall, fly or fall
One more shot, my name is called
I don't wanna live like this
I refuse to call it quits
