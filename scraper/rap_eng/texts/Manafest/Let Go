[Verse 1]
My faith tells me if I jump I'll fly
Then why am I frozen with the thought I'll die?
Gravity's not fantasy, reality's in front of me
Will I be the one that falls or soars in the sky?

[Verse 2]
A death in the family can change a perspective
If love is a currency, then where'd I invest it?
I want to be the mirror that has You reflected
I want to leave a legacy I have no regrets with

[Pre-Chorus]
God told me, "Don't look back."
If you want to move on, got to forgive 'em of that
I try to set sail on a path to forgiveness
Still floating off and my sails are windless

[Chorus]
The world won't bring me down
If I just keep harking on
And if I just say Your name
You will cover me with Your love
If I want to follow You I know
I've got to learn to let it go

[Verse 2]
Even when I fall, I'm still a saint in Your eyes
Even when I crawl, I know I'm still held high
I try to fast from my bad thoughts and baptize my back talk
Circling the same line, I know it's gonna take time

[Pre-Chorus]
God told me, "Don't look back."
If you want to move on, got to forgive 'em of that
I try to set sail on a path to forgiveness
Still floating off and my sails are windless

[Chorus]
The world won't bring me down
If I just keep harking on
And if I just say Your name
You will cover me with Your love
If I want to follow You I know
I've got to learn to let it go

[Bridge]
Cause You're faithful
Never let me down
Like an angel
When you turn me around
See a rainbow
Not a doubt around
So graceful
It's time to let it go
(2x)

[Chorus]
The world won't bring me down
If I just keep harking on
And if I just say Your name
You will cover me with Your love
If I want to follow You I know
I've got to learn to let it go
(2x)
I've got to learn to let it go
I've got to learn to let it go
