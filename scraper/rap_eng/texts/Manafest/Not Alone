You're standing on the edge of disaster
Telling me you can't go on
I can hear your heart beating faster
Wondering what you did wrong
Broken inside, losing your fight
I know what its like to break
So let me hold you through the pain
I know what you're fighting for
Youre in the middle of a war
Even down on your broken road
Theres still hope
You are not alone
Tell me what youre waiting for
Just let me open up the door
To give you hope
You are not alone
(You're not alone, you're not alone)
You are not alone
(You're not alone, you're not alone)
You are not a slave to the master
A prisoner inside your mind
I can't even see what you're after
But I will never leave your side
Never lose hope
End of your rope
Staring death face to face
Will you stand or walk away
I know what youre fighting for
Youre in the middle of a war
Even down on your broken road
Theres still hope
You are not alone
Tell me what youre waiting for
Just let me open up the door
To give you hope
You are not alone
(You're not alone, you're not alone)
You are not alone
(You're not alone, you're not alone)
Ill light you up
When your flame is out
Ill pick you up
When your world is down
Don't be afraid, don't be afraid
Ill light you up
When your flame is out
Ill pick you up
When your world is down
Don't be afraid
I know what youre fighting for
Youre in the middle of a war
Even down on your broken road
Theres still hope
You are not alone
Tell me what youre waiting for
Just let me open up the door
To give you hope
You are not alone
(You're not alone, you're not alone)
You are not alone
(You're not alone, you're not alone)
