[Verse 1: Manafest]
Questions are rising in
I'm finding it hard to be honest with music
I rhyme again
Reminding myself that I to lie to myself
Trading my health and increasing my wealth
Can you save me?
Not even hiding it
I'm lying awake and I'm breaking my promises
Pressure and pain
Yeah, ya think you know me, don't ya?
Covered in rage
Put the gun back in your holster
Walk in my shoes
I'll sing you some blues
Tripping on truth and i'm looking a fool
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
What are you thinking?
Look in the mirror, sober and stinking
Losing my vision, man on a mission (uh)
Come back and kill it, not for a visit
Really gon' live it, not wanna miss it
Really gon' live it, really gon' live it


[Chorus: The Drawing Room]
Time is too short
I can't afford
To get caught looking back
I relapsed of course
I've been reborn
Caught in the storm
I want more, so I act like a man and go
(2x)
Act like a man and go, and go, and go, lets go

[Verse 2: Manafest]
Holes that I'm digging in
It's only a minute, but what I've been thinking is
Admit it and go again, hold to ya goal to win
Hope that ya roll a ten, roll it in
Give me your towel then
I'll battle my hours in, 10,000 count them in
Why am I saying it?
You suck with the money
Your problem is saving it
Yeah spend it all
Lifes a journey, learn to crawl
Climb the arm of God tall
I stand in awe, grace
Give me a second chance
Being a better man
Eating my words again, walking on sinking sand
Dream of the promise land
Why do you want it?
Working so hard
Not just to flaunt it
My flag ships got a cross on it
Who wants it?
Go in there
Swallow your pride
Don't be scared
Beware
Take courage
Don't take care
Pray God, pray to God
I dare

[Chorus: The Drawing Room]
Time is too short
I can't afford
To get caught looking back
I relapsed of course
I've been reborn
Caught in the storm
I want more, so I act like a man and go
(2x)
Act like a man and go, and go, and go, lets go
