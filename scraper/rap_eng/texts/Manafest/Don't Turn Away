I never talk the talk unless I walk the walk in the dark what you want come get it
I see you fake and flaunt, the way you pose and stomp, I got soul and I know where you're headed
So if you want what I got come get it
And if not than go and just forget it
Cause in the light I can see you faking, over rated

Let's face it close the case gangsta's
Bass to your face, with faith based answers
I got anthems, ain't talking hansom
Bloods on your hands you wash and just abandon
I wanna talk to ye, put God in ye
In a non threatened way, it's calling ye
Start walking yo, what's stalling ye
You've fallen "Get UP"

So I'll
Be the first to, introduce you
To the one that's trapped inside you
Don't turn away
Away from yourself
Every time you, buy into
All the lies of the life they're feeding you
Don't play their game, it's not the way, don't turn away from yourself

I'm not the type to write just to go fight yall
I'm holding mic's to light the fire up in us
Taking flight to heights it's so ridiculous
I see lies coming out your mouths & such
Yall selling it yall don't believe in it
Yall keep yelling it, we start repeating it
Brainwashing us you fake and pose cool
I see right through you, right through

So I'll
Be the first to, introduce you
To the one that's trapped inside you
Don't turn away
Away from yourself
Every time you, buy into
All the lies of the life they're feeding you
Don't play their game, it's not the way, don't turn away from yourself

Don't' turn away
You got to listen
Don't play the game
It's all in act and
It's not the Way
Come on be real
Following ye heart is the only way you'll get it

They try to take me yawning, I hear that alarm and
Got to get ahead of the game they keep calling in
I hear them following, yo they just bothering
Me from walking in my dreams all hollering
I make a choice and I live it, I give it
All to the cause even if we all fall
I scene what's really real
They lie, cheat, and steal
I speak life watch my city heal
