[Verse 1]
Head down, walk quick
Do what your boss say
Only one lane
Don't talk, move this way
March to the drum
No leader but a gun spray
All runaways shot
In broad mid day
From the dust a hero
Comes to make waves
Who can save our souls
Blood stains fade
The clouds move cherubs play
Wash it away
Rider comes justice for all

[Chorus]
Coming with an army
I'll stand
I'll march
I won’t back down
I'm coming with an army
I'll go, I'll fight
I won't give up
No weapon formed can harm me
Ohhh woah oh, oh woah oh

[Verse 2]
Federal reserve
Throw your citizens a curve
Sell us on debt
Slow bleeding to death
A cartel sets sail
You brainwash well
Taxing us heavy
Watch banks get bailed
I'm betting on gold
Like Abraham & Job
Plus you can't print it
Need American spirit
I'm pro-God, pro-love
Praying for our gov
Prepping for the day
I know he's coming back for us

[Chorus]
Coming with an army
I'll stand
I'll march
I won't back down
I'm coming with an army
I'll go, I'll fight
I won't give up
No weapon formed can harm me
I'll stand
I'll march
I won't back down
Coming with an army
I'll go, I'll fight
I won't give up
I'm coming with an army

[Bridge]
Gonna get it
Gonna get it
They know
They gonna get it
Gonna get it
Uh huh
Gonna get it
Gonna get it
We shake them down, down, down
You know we shake them down, down, down
They know
We gonna shake them down, down, down
They know, we know
They know
We gonna shake them down, down, down

Born to hit it
To finish
Fearless, I'm feeling a fight
Born to kill it
I'm finished with sinning
Good night

It's never ending cause I've chosen a side
Forever telling those that don’t to
Know a truth from a lie

We shake them down, down, down
You know we shake them down, down, down
They know
We know they know
We gonna shake them down, down, down
Cause, cause

[Chorus]
We coming with an army
I'll stand
I'll march
I won't back down
I'm coming with an army
I'll go, I'll fight
I won't give up
No weapon formed can harm me
I'll stand
I'll march
I won't back down
Coming with an army
Ohhh woah oh, oh woah oh
I'm coming with an army
