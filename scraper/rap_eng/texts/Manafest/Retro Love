It's been awhile now I've been searching thinking about
Sin and drought, up and down spinning round, round, round
Round, Round I haven't found it, truths alive don't doubt it
Pounding down the doors & hallowing ow, ow, ow
Slouched like a youth I found God in the room
He said yo I know you, I got a girl for ye dude
Am I high, am I dead, am I alive, is this real
Can I touch can I feel, pinch me, oww yeah
Sat me down daps & pounds, showed me style
Told me how, hold a second that's my girl
I think I've figured out that a

I'm down with ye, down with ye
I'll hit the town with ye
Can I get some love yo hommie show me love

I'm down with ye, down with ye
I'll stick around with ye
Can I get some love yo hommie show me love

I, I, I want to show ye
I think I'm ready for ye
Just let the party music play
I'm down with ye down with ye
I got that sound for ye
Just let the music play

I see it clear now her and I Cali style
She is fine, she is mine, likes it when I drop a rhyme
Chilling by the beach home
Surfing or on skateboards
Doesn't hurt that she's model
Run way girl, Makes me holla
We'll grow our family tree
Little Mana's Melanie's
Living free sipping drinks
Coke and Ice bubble tea's
God is watching over this
Blessings is so obvious
Call it bliss, call it crisp
This is how I want to live
Its retro automatic, the love is so dynamic
I'm dancing like an addict

I'm down with ye, down with ye
I'll hit the town with ye
Can I get some love yo hommie show me love

I'm down with ye, down with ye
I'll stick around with ye
Can I get some love yo hommie show me love

I, I, I want to show ye
I think I'm ready for ye
Just let the party music play
I'm down with ye down with ye
I got that sound for ye
Just let the music play

But if you don't think your down with me
That's cool cause we can still be friends at least
And a, we could just play Monopoly you'll see
You'll get to know me uh huh, you'll get to know me, know me
But I, I think you really might be right
I think you might just be the guy for me, and you and maybe you'll give me a ride, home

This is my song, glad you all came along, sing it now
Sing it loud
