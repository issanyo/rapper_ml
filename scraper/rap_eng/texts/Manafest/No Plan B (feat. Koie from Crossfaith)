[Verse 1: Manafest]
I drop in with my face to the wind
Spin 180Â° for the win
But I can't find my feet its like I lost the beat
Mid air and there's no plan B's
Hit the streets
Look before I leap again
Skeleton filled with adrenalin'
How can I know that I got what it takes?
When I've come so far, through the rain
Bear the pain
Makes no difference now
Face myself or get taken out
One more time got to live this loud
Back to the wall no turning around

[Chorus: Manafest]
It's too late it's my fate
I can't turn around
There's no fear, in the mirror
To hold me down
I'm too far, from the start
No I'm in too deep
I've got to stick to the plan
Cause there's no plan B
No turning back (no plan B)
There's no other path (no plan B)
And I know that this road is my destiny
I've got to stick to the plan
Cause there's no plan B

[Verse 2: Kenta Koie]
My life is so curious
A thousand pictures cut me off
I was betrayed by everything
I tell you a story of my life
My voice will stick it in and bleed it out
I crash the wall you change no other way
I walk on glass now
Stop praying any more
No turning back, no thinking now
I'm leaching out my destiny

[Chorus: Manafest & Kenta Koie]
It's too late it's my fate
I can't turn around
There's no fear, in the mirror
To hold me down (This is your turn)
I'm too far, from the start
No I'm in too deep (Don't look away)
I've got to stick to the plan
Cause there's no plan B
No turning back (You scream outside)
There's no other path (No one can crash me down)
And I know that this road is my destiny
I've got to stick to the plan
Cause there's no plan B

[Bridge: Manafest & Kenta Koie]
All I know is I can't turn back
All I know is I can't turn back
Got to leave it in the past
Got to leave it in the past
(2x)
Cause this is the only road I've ever known (you're killing yourself)
There's no way that I could start again (again)

[Chorus: Manafest & Kenta Koie]
It's too late it's my fate
I can't turn around
There's no fear, in the mirror
To hold me down (This is your turn)
I'm too far, from the start
No I'm in too deep (Don't look away)
I've got to stick to the plan
Cause there's no plan B
No turning back (You scream outside)
There's no other path (No one can crash me down)
And I know that this road is my destiny
I've got to stick to the plan
Cause there's no plan B
