[Verse 1: Manafest]
California Christmas, my seasons been sunkissed
My shovel is done with, my jacket's been hung in
Leaves on the palm trees are green like the stockings
Eat chocolate and toffees, be good he is watching

[Pre-Chorus: Manafest]
Cookies and gifts, mistletoe kiss, old Saint Nick
Just one wish on my list
This is my California Christmas

[Chorus: Joel Piper & Manafest]
Palm tree stockings, Christmas time is here
Sunshine, good times, Christmas time is here
Sun's shining, I'm riding, I'll be at home
California Christmas
Christmas time, surfin' my beautiful coast
California Christmas

[Verse 2: Manafest]
California Christmas, the beaches are lit with
The campfires glistening and carolers singing
Cruising the coast with a tank not a coat
We're escaping the cold
I love Christmas the most

[Pre-Chorus: Manafest]
Cookies and gifts, mistletoe kiss, old Saint Nick
Just one wish on my list
This is my California Christmas

[Chorus: Joel Piper & Manafest]
Palm tree stockings, Christmas time is here
Sunshine, good times, Christmas time is here
Sun's shining, I'm riding, I'll be at home
California Christmas
Christmas time, surfin' my beautiful coast
California Christmas

[Interlude]

[Chorus: Joel Piper & Manafest]
Palm tree stockings, Christmas time is here
Sunshine, good times, Christmas time is here
Sun's shining, I'm riding, I'll be at home
California Christmas
Christmas time, surfin' my beautiful coast
California Christmas
