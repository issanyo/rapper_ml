There comes a time and point when you have to decide
There is no right way to do the wrong thing
But you gotta do what your afraid to do
Go where you're afraid to go
And every time you run away
Because you're afraid to do something big
You let an opportunity pass you by
You see you can't keep doing the same thing
Over and over and expect different results
The normal has to be ignored
The ordinary discarded
And the routine must be feared
A fighter isn't somebody who never fails
A fighter is someone who never quits
You are not the down trodden but the uplifted
You are the head and not the tail
You really think He brought you this far just to leave you now?
Dreaming isn't a waist of time
You have to decide to get up and go again
When everybody else has gone home
The perseverance to get up and go again
And the drive to see the dream fulfilled
You can't beat a man that doesn't stop
GET UP
