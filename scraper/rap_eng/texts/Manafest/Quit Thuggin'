Verse I
Find myself with my mic in a tight spot
There the type to pick a fight in the light or dark
Sceneries turn mean they try to mimic me
Many men is thieves epidemically
Calling names out who's gonna settle it
They use fists ignorant to break our fellowship
Those thugs at the parties never get chicks
Under developed kids dropping out a English
Bunch of idiots living insignificant
Caught in sin, anything they'd kill a king
No worries man be Christness got me off the crutches living righteous
And I might just
Hang with the likes of these common thieves, prostitutes you can say you saw me

Chorus
If I'm a live, I'm a live for my God
And if I'm a die I'm a die for the cause
Don't' matter got peace in my mind
Stay dead imma chill imma shine
If I'm a live, I'm a live for my God
And if I'm a die I'm a die for the cause
Don't' matter got peace in my mind
Day after day, let the love shine
