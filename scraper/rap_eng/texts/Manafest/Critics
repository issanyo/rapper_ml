This one's for all the people who talk
Shoot you down before you reach the top
Cause they just don't know much about me
You know the types that say this and that
Jealous types trying to hold you back
Soon it will be as clear as can be
For those who feel that they need to speak
My life is more than stories on beats
You'd know that if you new about me

Can I just rock a rhyme one time?
Elevate minds enjoy the vibe
Like 93 till infinity I'm alive
I light the vicinity spit the rhyme
But I still receive cut eye, when I, bust rhyme
Must be the light or the shine from the white
It can't be the skill or the beat or the mic
Could it be jealousy that you're not quite like, me
I'm not like you your attitude is at the altitude
Like dude I want to battle you
I'm not budging only God's judging
You can take the glory, I'm not fake fronting
Nothings stopping me, God's still calling me
Your own insecurities is killing ye softly
The rap artist, dissed than disregarded
Stick around yo I'm just getting started

This one's for all the people who talk
Shoot you down before you reach the top
Cause they just don't know much about me
You know the types that say this and that
Jealous types trying to hold you back
Soon it will be as clear as can be
For those who feel that they need to speak
My life is more than stories on beats
You'd know that if you new about me

All of a sudden I'm becoming the talk of the town
Cause my lyrics seem to be getting more positive now
It's true I'm the same dude they talking about
Cause I don't hand out tracks when I'm walking around
But I know "what you know"
Only God can judge me, so if it's only God that loves me
I'm OK, I can say that, I'm a man of God so when I make raps
I'm like eight tracks, I don't play they can talk the talk
I walk the walk, while they at mardi Grais and in the dark there lost
I don't stop to watch I walk with God like ladi dah
They still watching, they probably are

You can't catch me or form a weapon against me
The best kept secret has sworn to protect me
If you got a problem I suggest you arrest me
I'm not guilty, dirty, but not filthy
Like the Kennedy's you wanna put an end to me
Bullet in my melodies but ye never met me
I love my enemies not just cause it says so
I got joy un-control over flowing yo
Don't hate it you'll keep us separated
Where's the love man yo it's so underated?
