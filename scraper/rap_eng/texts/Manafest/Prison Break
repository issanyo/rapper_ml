I could never say no
Making my veins glow
Take another one
Try to let the pain go
I know its killing me
Its not my destiny
I float in outer space
Im in another place
Then I black out
Wake up and Im so afraid
This burden's suffocating
By a thread Im barely hanging
All the nights, and all the lies you sold to me
I sacrificed and lost a time Ill never see
You stared and you kicked me as I crawl
Watch me stand when you thought Id fall
Ill make this prison break
Suffering the same road
Stuck in the same clothes
When I try to run
Hunt me in my cage closed
My world is twist and tattered
My heart is beat and battered
Even when Im shaken
About to cave in
My faith rises
I can feel my spirit raging
I pray and someone hears me
Today Im done believing
All the nights, and all the lies you sold to me
I sacrificed and lost a time Ill never see
You stared and you kicked me as I crawl
Watch me stand when you thought Id fall
Ill make this prison break
I won't keep walking blind
I won't let down my eyes
You won't fool me this time
Take control of my life
Manifest in the light
I won't lay down and die!
All the nights, and all the lies you sold to me
I sacrificed and lost a time Ill never see
You stared and you kicked me as I crawl
Watch me stand when you thought Id fall
Ill make this prison break
