You want me to sprint
You want me to run
And I can't go on
2nd winds coming
Blood starts pumping
I was never nothing, no, no
Not nothing
Never, never, never say never
Out from the dust got better
Found love buried like a treasure
I will never give up
Done with the hickups
Im a man on a mission
A man with a vision
When dreams come alive
Whimps dont survive
Will I cross that line
Time will tell
This is my life
Since I was a boy
Ive known that voice
Now Im a man
Ive made my choice
Ooooh, Im going all the way
Ooooh, Im giving everything
No room for compromise
Willing to sacrifice
Ooooh, its time I come alive
C-C-C-come alive
Less than a second
Know no limits
Till I hear finished
Still goin kill it
Write it
Let every homeboy bite it
Gone
Standing on a psalm
With God on my arm
Witness the business
Interest and income
Building the kingdom
Im not a victim
I got a plan
Ill take a stand
I say we can
(I say we can)
Running the race
With blood on my face
Dont play it safe
Im still on the chase
Since I was a boy
Ive known that voice
Now Im a man
Ive made my choice
Ooooh, Im going all the way
Ooooh, Im giving everything
No room for compromise
Willing to sacrifice
Ooooh, its time I come alive
Did you ever think that you could fly
Did you ever stop to even try
Have you ever dreamed past a day
Have you ever given wings to faith
Theres a hero buried deep inside
Let it out and watch it come alive
Ooooh, Im going all the way
Ooooh, Im giving everything
No room for compromise
Willing to sacrifice
Ooooh, its time I come alive
Its time I come alive
C-C-C-come alive
