[Intro]
Yo mana you ready man, you're on in 5 minutes dude
Get your stuff get your DJ and go kill it

[Verse 1]
I'm like blow
Step out on the stage like I'm infamous
Sound of a thousand kids screaming all into it
Like you no my name? Or even know my songs (What!!) Adlibs
They even no the lyrics to chant and sing along (uh huh)
It's like eh yo, He got that style
I'm like yeah yall, it's going down
Emceeing with freedom I'm seeing
Kid's freaking the feeling of reaping the seeds and I'm speaking
And I like that, I'm a still rap
I won't come fake styling like ye plastic gats
If you didn't know I spit the syllables
We're bringing you Manafest style live at the rodeo, radio, video, stereo here we go

[Hook]
I've traveled all over the globe
What's under ye nose
Rip the shows if it's sunny or snows
Sell it to the rich feed it to the poor and you know
Its Kodak moments up live in stereo

Rodeo, Radio, Video, Stereo

[Verse 2]
Stage dive off a lyrical high without the red eyes
Spiritual miracle signs through the man I
Serve with the most respect, I don't boast to get
6 zero check's survival of the fittest
People diss ye, people like ye
Battle freestyle you, Who's wiser? You a rhymer?
Hope ye have your lyrical chops top notch
Before you get sling shotted off the mic and cut
It's a cold game pick up ye flow man
You better have skills plus an ill business plan
Get thick skin or gain a lot of weight
This is hip hop rock'n roll rodeo let's go!!!!

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Big crowds to small crowds, any crowd
We go town to town, bust many styles
People smiling all across the island
Kick freestyles till yall buck wilding
My jeans is still sagging my face soaked sweating
Before the show I'm in the bathroom resting
My own private seat I peep a magazine
Think about how I'm a emcee for his majesty
I want a freak yall take ye so high
I want freedom in ye life at all times
We gonna rock from now and forever
Are yall ready? (YEAH) well than bring it

[Hook]
