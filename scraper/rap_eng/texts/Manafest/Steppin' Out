Im stepping out with a style like a face lift
To all the haters out there you got to change it
Its not ok, with me no, its not ok get on board
Who doesnt like a brand new pair of shoes?
Just got it cut showing off the hair due
Ive been here once before
Ive been there now no more
This is more than a fashion statement
This is me living out my patience
Pick out from a choice of favorites
What jeans, what shirt, holla mayhem
Amen to the man that made it
Im a rock it on the stage when im playing
Im fresh to step with the good looks got the hood shook
Take a good look stepping with the good foot, oh!!

Chorus:
So watch me turn it up loud
Im taking over the town
Im sticking out from the crowd
Im stepping out there!!!
I got the craziest style
That you can see it for miles
So paparazzi go wild
Im stepping out there, now!!!

Verse ii
Yo dude, check out this shirt here
Thats dope man get it in the black ye
Dang man this one it dont fit
So hip, but ill get it in white i guess
My girls gonna trip on it, gonna trip on it
When she sees my outfit im a so rock it
With the shoes, got to wear the shoes
Nomis hoodie in the white and blue
Its style, its on its me
Its now its fresh its free
So shocking, popping, locking
Heads nodding, rocking
Im stepping out!!!

Chorus:
So watch me turn it up loud
Im taking over the town
Im sticking out from the crowd
Im stepping out there!!!
I got the craziest style
That you can see it for miles
So paparazzi go wild
Im stepping out there, now!!!

Break down (bridge)
Im stepping out there, now!!!
Im stepping out there, now!!!
Im stepping out there, now!!!

Verse iii

When i step in a room, i want all eyes gazed
All eye brows raised yeah hes got taste
Hey thats the guy with the crazy style
Stepping so fly dressed to stick out
Known to walk by head is held high
Not cocky, confident recognize
Clothes dont make me, but sure acquaint me
If ye feel me, come on and get crazy

So watch me turn it up loud

I got the craziest style
That you can see it for miles
So paparazzi go wild
Im stepping out there, now!!!
