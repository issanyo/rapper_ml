You won't call, won't talk
What's wrong with ye
We used talk, go for walks
Now I don't see ye
It's not the same, like the days
When we used to meet up
You've changed in a way
Like you got secrets
You won't pick up, your mom says ye distant
And I can't figure this out without your help
I want to know ye, or wanna not know ye
I try to get close ye keep pushing me over

Why won't you talk to me?
I'd tell you anything
Oh don't push me away
I want to know you
I want to know you
I'm through with questioning
I thought you felt the same
No don't push me away
I want to know your thoughts
I want to know your mind
I want to know you I want know you
Let me out this place
Let me into your space place, I want to know you, I want to know you

It's been two weeks 3 days, I'm not sleeping
I had a dream you were flying this plane leaving
I got a feeling it was real and I wasn't dreaming
Is it me or not seeing you, has got me freaking?
My self esteem fleeing, a piece of me missing
My friends say I should bail while I'm still breathing
You got to call me, let me know what you're thinking
I'm free falling, cold, all alone sinking

Sorry this is not in person, but this is not working
I wrote this, hope you get it cause it's not worth it
Loved people love people
Hurt people hurt people
You hurt me and it cut lethal
I tried so hard, I was so young
I flied so far thinking it was real love
Now I'm gone so long girl I've moved on
I thank God cause he put me with a real one
