Open my eyes, open them wide

Verse I
Let me go, let me play, let me live a little yeah
Let me sow, let me grow, supernatural
Let me fly, let me ride living faith or die
Falling on my face 7 times yet I still rise
Eh yo, eh yo, I rode the merry go
Round and round let me get off I'm not playing yo
Stop ripping me off I'm not staying broke
People still wanna talk, my sleep's sweet bro

Chorus:
I finally found, a place, to cover me
That can't be torn, or cut, by the words you say
And your love and grace, they comfort me
No one can take it away, no one can take it from me
Kick it

Verse II
Downtown singing it, up town swinging it
Blow, blow ripping it, out loud kicking it
Follow suit with the crowd I'm not, looking for crowns uh huh
Sound of the rock!! Hey, Hey!!!

You asked me, passed me, stepping harass me
Do I ever feel like passing out in the back seat?
Ah yeah, not yeah, but sometimes yeah
But fear don't got a hold of me this year
Girls don't mean a thing to me in pairs
We rock as team our dreams are here
Billionaire boy, with a millionaire choice
Noise is chilling I've been given a voice

Chorus:
I finally found, a place, to cover me
That can't be torn, or cut, by the words you say
Your love and grace, they comfort me
No one can take it away, no one can take it from me
Kick it

Bridge
Open my eyes open them wide
Let me go, let me play, let me live a little yeah Let me sow, let me grow, supernatural
Open myself to what I find
Let me fly, let me ride living faith or die falling on my face 7 times yet I still rise
Open my eyes open them wide
Every time I lie awake everywhere that I look I can see your face
