[Intro: Manafest]
Get that
We gonna hit that
Yeah
We gonna get that
Do a 180°
Hit a 180°
Do a turn baby, uh
Manafest gonna stick to his guns
We got Solomon uh, he’s gonna stick to his guns
Gonna leave it all behind gonna stick to your guns
Come on

[Verse 1: Manafest]
I need to chill out
Shut my flippin' big mouth
Hog tie my tongue down
Uhh uhh (right now)
Turn off the noggin
Or its down hill toboggan
Like last time and lost it
Got fired by big boss, it’s
1 AM, shut your mind off
Quit the mind talk
Get ya sleep on
REM deep dream on
Beep beep nissan
It's me honking, uh uh
Talking to myself in a hotel
No pills
Ticked off at something
The label, I blame someone
Who doesn't
Get upset from time to time
I thank London
She keeps me laughing
Like when I send a nasty email
I should a thought about it first
I guess it could of been worse
Reverse
180° turn before I burn
Pick up the phone to apologize
And close my eyes
I gotta do a 180°
Hit a 180°
Turn a 180°
Gotta do a 180° turn

[Chorus: Soul Glow Activatur]
Born leader, gotta stick to your guns
Two fingers in the air, gotta stick to your guns
When ya leave it all behind cause it's second to none
Keep ya finger on the trigger
Stick to your guns
Yeah
(2x)

[Verse 2: Manafest]
AA says I need faith
And me thinks I need patience
From the aches and the shakes
I swear it's just a visit
I wasn't gonna sip it
Never catch me slipping
Baby what you thinking?
Relapse, again, again
I got a quit it
I'm willing to go the innings
Give me just a minute
I know that I can do it
God can pull me through it
Let me tie my shoes in
I know that I can do it
I gotta do a 180°
Turn a 180°
Hit a 180°
Gotta do a 180° turn
Do a 180°
Turn a 180°
Hit a 180°
Gotta do a 180° turn

[Chorus: Soul Glow Activatur]
Born leader, gotta stick to your guns
Two fingers in the air, gotta stick to your guns
When ya leave it all behind cause it's second to none
Keep ya finger on the trigger
Stick to your guns
Yeah
(2x)

[Bridge: Soul Glow Activatur]
I refuse to change all my dreams
I'm sticking to my guns and you know that's evergreen
Eyes on the prize like a laser beam
Gotta a whole lotta love in my blood stream
No disguises, I just do me
Locked and loaded
Happy family
Full time dreamer
But here's the kicker
Stick to your guns
Life gets bigger

[Chorus: Soul Glow Activatur]
Born leader, gotta stick to your guns
Two fingers in the air, gotta stick to your guns
When ya leave it all behind cause it's second to none
Keep ya finger on the trigger
Stick to your guns
Yeah
(3x)
