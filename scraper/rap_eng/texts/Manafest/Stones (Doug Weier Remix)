[Intro]
Your lies are always the loudest
I'm trying to do something great
I don't listen to you anymore
I've moved on

[Verse 1]
I'm a young gun
Reload in the moment
You thought I was done
I've got the war won
Fear has you frozen
The bell has been rung
I'm the thorn inside your flesh
I terrorize your rest
I'm always miles ahead
I'm an outlaw
Quick with the draw when I rip you apart
There's no pit stop
Missing the mark
You're just ticking me off
Ride or die I paralyze your threat
I crucified regret
Step aside, who's next

[Pre-Chorus]
You think that you know me
You thought you could hold me
(You just don't know when to stop)
You think you could fool me
But you never knew me
So come and take your best shot

[Chorus]
You know you can't touch this
So go throw your stones cause you're not even close
You know you can't touch this
Yeah, you're moving too slow, so let it go
You know you can't touch this, (no)
So go throw your stones cause you're not even close
You know you can't touch this (no)
Yeah, you're moving too slow, so let it go
Let it go

[Breakdown]

[Verse 2]
No apology
The prodigy honestly it's been the God in me
Never stopping me
In it to win it
I'll always be killing it
You follow blind like suicide
Have you lost your mind
I reclaim my life


Sleep with one eye open
I'm focused, you're choking, I'm golden
This is my time
Chosen to get it
I own it and exit
I'm awake, I'm alive, amen
I don't play pretend
Mercy never ends

[Pre-Chorus]
You think that you know me
You thought you could hold me
(You just don't know when to stop)
You think you could fool me
But you never knew me
So come and take your best shot

[Chorus]
You know you can't touch this
So go throw your stones cause you're not even close
You know you can't touch this
Yeah, you're moving too slow, so let it go
You know you can't touch this, (no)
So go throw your stones cause you're not even close
You know you can't touch this (no)
Yeah, you're moving too slow, so let it go
Let it go

[Breakdown]

[Interlude]
You can't
You can't
You can't touch this
You can't
You can't
You can't touch this
You can't
You can't
You can't touch this
You can't
You know can't touch this

[Breakdown]

[Outro]
Let it go, let it go
Let it go, let's go
Let it go, let's go
