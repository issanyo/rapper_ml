[Verse 1: Manafest]
Manafest
Hey yo!
Way back when, when I was 18
I chased dreams, chased girls
Chased anything in tight jeans
I faced things as a teen and got caught
Charged by the cops in the mall parking lot
[?]
So this is part 2, moms look at me now
I wound up with a second chance
New man, new ideas, new plan from the man
I came out swingin', not thinkin' just drinkin'
Blinkin' my eyes wakin' up still alive
Why I did what I did I don't know
But I do know God's got my soul saved in escrow
When there's a fork in the road I know where to go
I'm not a domino fallin' into problems no
Follow me, follow [?] to the heavenlies
There's a secret locked down in the melody
(Secret locked down in the melody)

[Chorus: Rel McCoy]
Just like the problems these days can take
I can't complain
My soul's been changed
The looking glass shows a man of shame
But I said [?]
We'll never meet again

[Verse 2: Manafest]
I see it like there's only one way out
Like for me to [?] it's like I'm turning around
Somehow I started rhymin' and puttin' it down
My whole life's been about me dying to self
I've found that I could speak to [?] teach and preach
Be a light to the world so seen and get heard
These are the keys to life
I've seen it work
I believe what I read it's Christ in my verse
I used to be the nerd, too scared to talk to her
My nerves would have me shake, I wouldn't look you in the face
Came with stamina, now I'm on camera
Puttin' in works, still lookin' to serve
I'm not the same kid you saw a few years ago
I'm not the same kid you saw a just a month ago
I met the vertigo, changin' my scenario
No day's the same, my faith has me changed
I've been down the road and back again with accidents
Now I'm back with a love so passionate
(So passionate)

[Chorus: Rel McCoy]
Just like the problems these days can take
I can't complain
My soul's been changed
The looking glass shows a man of shame
But I said [?]
We'll never meet again
Just like the problems these days can take
I can't complain
My soul's been changed
([?])
The looking glass shows a man of shame
But I said [?]
We'll never meet again
(No-oh)
