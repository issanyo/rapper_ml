[Intro]
We got it, we got it, we got it going on
And yo we got it, we got it
Now march to the drums, YO

[Verse 1]
We got it going on, 300 million strong
Stop the bombs, love riot in the streets, cuz
Smile for the camera, your in America
No terrors tearing us, we won't surrender up
Benevolent and you know, evidence and we sow
Jump out the boat, go, go
We're singing were swinging we're turning it up
So let me see all your hands, wah oh, wah oh
I give a shout for the ladies, men still standing
Grant me a wish, and I'll be dancing, prancing, love romancing
We got it going on in your America, my America, oh America

[Chorus]
Hey (hey), Ho (ho)
Now we're gonna rock it
'Till the lights go out (out)
There's fire in the kitchen again/
Hey (hey), Ho (ho)
Now we're gonna rock it
'Till the wheels fall off
Oh-oh-oh..we got it goin on/

[Verse 2]
We got it, we got it, we got it going on, and yo we got it, we got it, now march to the drums, YO
I'm not the only one, who's ever held a gun
I'd rather shoot some love, Superman go save someone
They had me on the run, now I'm on the hunt
I got have some fun, before my time is done
Let's start a riot, a riot, love in the streets
I'm so wired on fire no reason to sleep
I can't deny it I'm flying, higher then trees
So let's spark up the jam, woe, oh woe oh
I give a shout to the ladies, men still standing
Grant me a wish, I'll be dancing, prancing, love romancing
We got it going on in your America, my America, oh America

[Chorus]
Hey (hey), Ho (ho)
Now we're gonna rock it
'Till the lights go out (out)
There's fire in the kitchen again/
Hey (hey), Ho (ho)
Now we're gonna rock it
'Till the wheels fall off
Oh-oh-oh..we got it goin on
