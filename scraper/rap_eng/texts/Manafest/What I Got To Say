[Intro]
I got a story for yall, about two people, living different lifestyles
You never thought it would happen like this

[Verse 1]
There once was a lost boy living all annoyed
All aboard let me take you on tour
And travel through the mind of an innocent adolescence
Brains affected from his friends and fetus
He lives all alone with his mom and she drinks
He's alive but he sinks into lies, he's deceived
The girls don't like um, teachers don't want him
Uh oh I don't know he skateboards out the door
Tries to find his soul while he's falling down a hole
Runs into the wrong groupies they going on stupid
Acting foolish, get him to do what he shouldn't
Breaking and entry, will leave you broke mentally
You don't want it keep your own wallet
They calling you soft behind bars is no option
Life's a little a bit, hard when gripping it
Take control or others will start living it

[Chorus]
So listen to what I got to say
Cause this type of stuff it happens everyday
If I told ye would you hear me?
Or would ye hear the truth, and not believe me

[Verse 2]
Super stars are so beautiful, they want you ooh, and ahh off they looks
Look surprised, Icons in the eyes, of us looking up
Magazines posters, autographs and such
I thought I'd try to see her I went inside to meet her
Found out her real side would just cry and cry
All night all day camera's in her face, she puts a smile on
She's happy just to play along, God was on my lips
We talked about the biz
Entertainment what it is affecting the kids
Do you know about the power that you have?
When you dance, in the songs that you sang
These guy's is like Dang!!!
What the deal is, tell me how you feeling
There's a God that can bring your life healing
She just took it in stride there was glaze on her eyes
I offered Christ left it to her to decide
I said, if you want it search and you'll find it

[Chorus]
So listen to what I got to say
Cause this type of stuff it happens everyday
If I told ye would you hear me?
Or would you hear the truth, and not believe me

[Bridge]
If you want it, search and you'll find it
You don't, but you've got to free yourself

[Verse 3]
Take my advice from two types of life
Two stories two kids living without Christ
If you D.I.E you ain't at all happy
Use sadly, living in hell teeth is nashing
Oh my gosh, what the heck do I do
Just know that there can only be one truth
--that's it that's all, now I'm signing off
Follow me here's the chorus sing along
