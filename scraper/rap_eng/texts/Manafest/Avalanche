[Intro]
Get me out, (out) get me out (out)

[Verse I]
PREACHER, PREACHER what you got for me save my soul
See beneath, and clip my wings I'm not an angel
I try and try to be good, I've lied with pride I'm a crook
Turn the lights down, burning up the night now

Sign my life out, I'm sick of living here yo
If you can help choir boy ring the church bells
I'd turn back if I could, erase the pain if I could
But I'm an animal and I don't know if I can

[Chorus]
Hey!!
Cause I'm the prodigal man of this avalanche
I'm going down, I'm going down, down
Hey!!!!
And if you turn me in
I'll confess my sins
I'm going down, I'm going down, down
Before I'm six feet deep
I'm washing my hands clean
Just get me out of this avalanche

[Verse 2]
You scared the junk out of me man
The Ghost Rider, hold my soul tighter
Jehovah take the ropes I'm a
Fly a plane out of the atmosphere
I've attacked this fear
This scars still here
I'm going on to the end
I'm holding out to a friend
I'm going I'm going
I don't care
I cursed a lot
The worst, the black sheep of the lot
Christopher Scott prepare to meet God

[Chorus]
Hey!!
Cause I'm the prodigal man of this avalanche
I'm going down, I'm going down, down
Hey!!!!
And if you turn me in
I'll confess my sins
I'm going down, I'm going down, down
Before I'm six feet deep
I'm washing my hands clean
Just get me out of this Avalanche

[Bridge]
Get me out, OUT
Get me out, OUT
Just get me out of this avalanche
Get me out, OUT
Get me out, OUT
Just get me out of this...

[Verse 3]
You guided me when I was
Blind with pride a right off
Knocked me off my saddle
Sabotaged and overshadowed
Watched you chase a man down
Watched you raise a man out
Mercy on me, forever I'm free

[Chorus]
Hey!!
Cause I'm the prodigal man of this avalanche
I'm going down, I'm going down, down
Hey!!!!
And if you turn me in
I'll confess my sins
I'm going down, I'm going down, down
Before I'm six feet deep
I'm washing my hands clean
Just get me out of this Avalanche

[Bridge]
Get me out, OUT
Get me out, OUT
Just get me out of this avalanche
Get me out, OUT
Get me out, OUT
Just get me out of this...
