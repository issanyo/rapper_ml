(Chorus)
Something's changing my life in the night
I don't know what it is yall
I'm believing it's Christ he is the light
Who ever would a thought yall

(Verse 1)
I'm not a dark child just a wild out abounds
Sabotaged God helped me out, beating down turned around
Deep down my soul, each round I go
No peace at home, falling domino
Rolled with the wind tossed in the sin
Coughing, head's moshing, thoughts banging
Hanging with my crew and, who's true man
I'm choosing my future groupings
Losing my sight looking for life
The fatherless type I might like to *choking*
Suicides in my thoughts each step I walk
Swallow alcohol with pills to with drawl
It all changed in the night time, the right place
The right time encounters divine see the signs
Die or live hostage, destinies calling
I let this God in, and pose pone an early coffin

(Chorus)
Something's changing my life in the night
I don't know what it is yall
I'm believing it's Christ he is the light
Who ever would a thought yall
Something's changing my life in the night
I don't know what it is yall
I'm believing it's Christ he is the light
Who ever would a thought yall

(Verse 2)
Something's changing I'm aging maintain my saneness
I can't explain it, my life's turning pages Ah! *scratces*
Waking up freaking out, hearing sounds out my mouth
It's not freestyle vocal chords peaking out
Call the executionist bomb unit
I got new sense to influence, yo ye life lose it
News out my radar they say I got God
Escape the chaos attacking it rocking heads off
Halt hold pause falls, calls cuts and cussing
Juggling, knees buckling, pain suck it in
If I'm a new man. The old is ruined
What I'm do a do a do doing
I'm different or I'm just tripping
Limited living edition
Falling on my face, falling on my face
It's a life cycle dark to light like Michael
Down night all, or Christ read the bible
Enlightening my the thoughts minds on a higher force
I've seen the light yall I've seen it all
(Chorus)
Something's changing my life in the night
I don't know what it is yall
I'm believing it's Christ he is the light
Who ever would a thought yall
Something's changing my life in the night
I don't know what it is yall
I'm believing it's Christ he is the light
Who ever would a thought yall
Something's changing my life in the night
I don't know what it is yall
I'm believing it's Christ he is the light
Who ever would a thought yall
Something's changing my life in the night
I don't know what it is yall
I'm believing it's Christ he is the light
Who ever would a thought yall
