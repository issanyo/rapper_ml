[Intro]
Gotta wake up

[Verse 1]
When the lights go out
That's when the lies get loud
Screaming in my head, screaming in my head
Leaving me for dead, leaving me for dead
When I'm on my own
And there's no one home
Save me from myself, save me from myself
Pull me out of hell, pull me out of hell

[Pre-Chorus]
I thought you would guide me
But you tried to blind me
Too long my eyes were shut
The voice whispers, I wake up

[Chorus]
You can talk loud, you can get wild
Just a dark cloud, imma step out and blow you away
Nowhere to run, you can't hide from me
You can get lost, imma get found
It's a shakedown, imma step out and blow you away
Nowhere to run, you can't hide from me

[Verse 2]
Through my blackest night
Came my brightest light
I am not alone, I am not alone
Fire in my soul, fire in my soul
I will learn to breath (I will learn to breath)
I reclaim my dreams (I reclaim my dreams)
Lie's over now, lie's over now
Your time is running out, time is running out

[Chorus]
You can talk loud, you can get wild
Just a dark cloud, imma step out and blow you away
Nowhere to run, you can't hide from me
You can get lost, imma get found
It's a shakedown, imma step out and blow you away
Nowhere to run, you can't hide from me

[Bridge]
Pushing me to pull the trigger
Punch you with the five finger
Didn't even know what hit ya
Pushing me to pull the trigger
Punch you with the five finger
Didn't even know what hit ya
Yeah, yeah

[Chorus]
You can talk loud, you can get wild
Just a dark cloud, imma step out and blow you away
Nowhere to run, you can't hide from me
You can get lost, imma get found
It's a shakedown, imma step out and blow you away
Nowhere to run, you can't hide from me
