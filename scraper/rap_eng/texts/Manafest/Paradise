[Verse 1:]
Met you by the coburg cove
The water had an ocean glow
Our foot steps walked a sandy line
The drummer had our tongues all tied
God only knows where we would go
It’s coast to coast a crazy road
So far from home
I know
But I would never look back now
Too many dreams come true
Praying when it’s so hard
Do what I got a do
Saying that I don’t know
Sometimes so scared
Thank god I still got you
Oh!!!

[Chorus:]
Our love is paradise
Our love’s electrifying
It keeps us strong
When we both walk through the fire
For you I’d give my life
I’d walk a million miles
Cause you’re the one
You are my paradise
You’re the one you’re my paradise
You’re the one my paradise
You’re the one you’re my paradise
You’re the one my paradise

[Verse 2:]
Mountains move when worry dies
The songs we sung have come alive
The gold coast screaming at the shows
Were letting go of all we know
So many no’s the path we chose
And felt alone can’t buy you clothes
Can’t hide my hope I know
But I would never look back now
Too many dreams come true
Praying when it’s so hard
Do what I got a do
Saying that I don’t know
Sometimes I’m so scared
Thank god I still got you
Oh!!!

[Chorus]

[Bridge:]
It’s us this time hun
Will never come undone
Live by this ocean
Sunsets and emotions
It’s love this time stunned
Waking up in your arms I’m
Never letting the storms in
Staying close to you girl let’s go

[Chorus]
