Chorus
Oh this is a song from my soul
This time I won't sweat it, I'm gonna let it go

Verse I
I don't recognize my own face no more
I stare in a mirror than turn and it's gone
Nameless and famous changing my alias
Manafest & Chris fighting for the right placement
1979 I was born 1995 I grabbed a board
1999 I wrote a song, spit a metaphor
Went from amateur to entrepreneur
You still don't know me, you dudes can't touch me
Stab me, kill me, hug me or love me
Inside I'm a person, hurting, and working
Pouring myself out, putting my neck out
Can you see him? I tell them I'm right here
He still won't come out he's rivaled with fear
Examined by the critics, and put on this dis list
I won't be jaded though I'm starting to see it
They don't respect him he's just another musician

Chorus
Oh this is a song from my soul
This time I won't sweat it, I'm gonna let it go
I won't stress I'll just do my best
Yeah!!! You've taken up all my cares
Given me eye sight and meaning
And I'll let the whole world know about you

Verse II
The voice of suicide
Used to creep up in my mind
The fat kid could care less if I lived or died
I didn't think it had affect on me
But now I'm 25 watching my weight size, I'm really scrawny
The name calling, bullying from the hooligans
The who's in, who's not had no friends
My audience is triple the size of that now
All eyes on me shall I rap now
Thank you all for coming to my show
Thank you for burning my cd that you stole
When I get desperate I write a message
My rhymes the essence of day to day lessons
Feeling butt naked my pride has been taken
Every mistake that I've made there taping
Can I find peace, can I find me
Who's the real man that's hiding behind the emcee?
I want to know

Bridge
What's real, what's not, what's real Super star Chorus
Oh this is a song from my soul
This time I won't sweat it, I'm gonna let it go
I won't stress I'll just do my best
Yeah!!! You've taken up all my cares
Given me eye sight and meaning
And I'll let the whole world know about you

Verse III
We may not agree on everything or anything
By any means I'm a fulfill the dream
I seen it come and go, I've tried to grab hold
Hope I don't end up losing my soul
Hip hop ain't worth it I've served and cursed it
Sacrificed to make it work, and lost my purpose
It's not what I'd die for to risk my wife and all
Strife cause can't compare the lives it's caught
I am Christian, emceeing a gifting, hip hop's what I'm living
Not replacing religion
I got relationship with a God in the sky
He talks to me defines wrong and the right
Talk to him, when you're walking or jogging
Skating or playing, or painting or balling
I'm a pass the mic, I on a path for Christ
Let me tell ye the, shoot I'm out a time

Chorus
Oh this is a song from my soul
This time I won't sweat it, I'm gonna let it go
I won't stress I'll just do my best
Yeah!!! You've taken up all my cares
Given me eye sight and meaning
And I'll let the whole world know about you
