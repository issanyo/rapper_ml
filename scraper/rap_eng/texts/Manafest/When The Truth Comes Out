[Verse 1]
I stay for the wrong reasons
I'm scared of my own freedom
Been so long inside this cell
When you lie, there's nothing else
Wanna go, but I'm not leaving
Have faith, but it keeps freezing
Ran this line a thousand times
Can't deny the truth inside

[Pre-Chorus]
All these nights that it kept me up
All these nights that it kept me up
And I'll die if I keep this up
I'll die if I keep this up

[Chorus]
When the truth comes out
When the truth comes out
It's loud, it's loud
When the truth comes out
When the truth comes out
It's loud, it's loud

[Verse 2]
Bite down on my lip again
You're supposed to be my best friend
Don't ask me what's going on
You know I'm barely holding
I'm about to lose my grip
I'm about to lose my grip
Don't pretend like you don't know
You know me the most of all

[Pre-Chorus]
All these nights that it kept me up
All these nights that it kept me up
And I'll die if I keep this up
I'll die if I keep this up

[Chorus]
When the truth comes out
When the truth comes out
It's loud, it's loud
When the truth comes out
(Truth comes out)
When the truth comes out
(Truth comes out)
It's loud, it's loud

[Bridge]
When the truth comes out
We can work this out
We can work this out
Ain't going down, down, down, down
Down, down, down
We can work this out
We can work this out
Ain't going down, down, down, down
Down, down, down

[Chorus]
When the truth comes out
When the truth comes out
It's loud, it's loud
When the truth comes out
When the truth comes out
It's loud, it's loud
When the truth comes out
When the truth comes out
It's loud, it's loud
When the truth comes out
When the truth comes out
It's loud, it's loud

[Outro]
When the truth comes out
(Truth comes out)
When the truth comes out
(Truth comes out)
It's loud, it's loud
When the truth comes out
(Truth comes out)
When the truth comes out
(Truth comes out)
It's loud, it's loud
