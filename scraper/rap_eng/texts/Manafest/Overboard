[Verse 1]
I hear you calling out
Our ship is going down
We're sinking and I can't let you go
I couldn't understand
You wouldn't take my hand
I watched you fall into the ocean below
It's a fight to survive
Do or die and to keep it alive

[Chorus]
We gotta wake up, we gotta save us
So baby hang on
I'm coming after you, I'm diving overboard
Any moment we could lose it
I'm coming after you, I'm diving overboard
S.O.S
I'm diving overboard off the edge
I'm diving overboard
I'm diving overboard
I'm diving overboard

[Verse 2]
It's all or nothing now
It's time we figure out
Or we'll be going back and forth
To the end
Cause every time we touch
We fall right back in love
Just to break apart like waves in the wind
Out of breath, ship is wrecked
In distress, but we'll fight for what's left

[Chorus]
We gotta wake up, we gotta save us
So baby hang on
I'm coming after you, I'm diving overboard
Any moment we could lose it
I'm coming after you, I'm diving overboard
S.O.S
I'm diving overboard off the edge
I'm diving overboard
I'm diving overboard
I'm diving overboard

[Bridge]
I'm rushing out
Coming now
Take my hand
I'm reaching down
Don't let go
I'll get you home
Lay you in a safety zone
Hold you in my arm's embrace
Never let it go astray
Storms will fade, sun will rise
Baby we gone, be alright
Breathe in, breathe out
There's still a heart beat pounding
Don't give up, open your eyes

[Chorus]
We gotta wake up, we gotta save us
So baby hang on
I'm coming after you, I'm diving overboard
Any moment we could lose it
I'm coming after you, I'm diving overboard
S.O.S
I'm diving overboard off the edge
I'm diving overboard
I'm diving overboard
I'm diving overboard
