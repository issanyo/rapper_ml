[Verse 1]
I drop in with my face to the wind
Spin 180 for the win
But I can't find my feet its like I lost the beat
Mid air and theres no plan Bs
Hit the streets

Look before I leap again
Skeleton filled with Adrenalin
How can I know that I got what it takes?
When I've come so far, through the rain
Bear the pain

Makes no difference now
Face myself or get taken out
One more time got to live this loud
Back to the wall no turning around

[Chorus]
Its too late Its my fate
I can't turn around
There's no fear, in the mirror
To hold me down
I'm too far, from the start
Now I'm in too deep

I've got to stick to the plan
Cause there's no Plan B

No turning back (No plan B)
Theres no other path, (No plan B)

And I know that this road is my destiny
I've got to stick to the plan
Cause theres no plan B

[Verse 2]
Get a shot, for the top on my soap box
Pop a zit go sing let my tunes talk
Cool kid, and I'm in the mood
Give me combo number 2
Whats up wich you?

Dude you look scared to me, better take a chair
Before you fail to see, A to Z like 3 times 3
Its the basics, homie embrace it
Come on!

Take the shot dont waste the clock
March to the drum of the #1 spot
Born for this, victorious
Storms break off so glorious

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
All I know is I can't turn back, all I know is I can't turn back
Got to leave it in the past, got to leave it in the past
All I know is I can't turn back, all I know is I can't turn back
Got to leave it in the past, got to leave it in the past

Cause this is the only road I've ever known
Theres no way that I could start again, Again

[Chorus]
