[Verse 1]
Red light, red light, green light go
Late night, late night, I just go
Burn out turn down the lights low
On the 5 coming down on my own
It's not too late, to get help
Don't lie, I know you can tell
I'm crazy, crazy tonight
I need a spark of Your light

[Verse 2]
I want it, want it so bad
Everything, all the things I don't have
All the times, every time I got mad
Should a listened, listen I'm back
Wishing I was where you are
Wishing at night on a star
This road, this road is so far
Come, come this car is in park

[Chorus]
Take my hands off the wheel
And let You drive
Let You drive
Let You drive
Here's the key to my heart
So come inside
Take my life
You can take my life
Take me where I need to go
Only thing I need to know
I am not alone
Take my hands off the wheel
And let You drive
Let You drive
Let You drive

[Verse 3]
I'm right, I'm right but I'm wrong
Who's side my side you've been on?
It"s hard so hard to admit
The pain the shame that I'm in
My God, my God I cry out
Here I surrender my doubt
You are the light of my life
The only way I survive

[Verse 4]
Never doubted doubted your plans
I come with stains on my hands
I lift them up to let go
Cause I've been driving alone
I burn and turn off this road
I've learned I'm lost on my own
I prayed my faith is intact
I blow my horn cause I I'm back

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
I stop you go
I won't look back
I start to think
I found my path
You move me
You move me
I'm off your on
I'm free at last
I take my seat
My bags are packed
You move me
You move me

[Chorus]
