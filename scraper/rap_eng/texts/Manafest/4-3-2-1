It's like 4,3,2,1
Ladies and gentlemen here's your anthem
Everyone now put your hands up UP, UP, UP, UP, UP
Now put your ends up

Can you put it up, can you raise it up
For the camera bounce like you getting crunk
I'm in my zone right now I'm in the groove right now
I sing along with the song like wow!!
Yeah that's the tune that makes me move
Get loose off of music with attitude, uh
And I won't stop, let my body rock
So hot until I hear the countdown, like

4, 3, 2, 1
Everyone to the dance floor
Everybody just rock tonight
Everybody just bounce if ye feeling hype, hey
4,3,2,1
Everyone to the dance floor
Everybody just rock tonight
Everybody just bounce if ye feeling hype, hey
Everybody just rock tonight
Everybody just bounce if ye feeling hype, hey

Break it down like a 1 o'clock, 2 o'clock
Base pounds till your ears pop, set it off
Get up off your seat doc, come alive
Step up off the wall girl, energize
D.A.N.C.E, for me V.I.P like you Got in for free

Till the last call, till the last song
I'm so on, I can hear it coming in like

4, 3, 2, 1
Everyone to the dance floor
Everybody just rock tonight
Everybody just bounce if ye feeling hype, hey
4,3,2,1
Everyone to the dance floor
Everybody just rock tonight
Everybody just bounce if ye feeling hype, hey
Everybody just rock tonight
Everybody just bounce if ye feeling hype, hey

Everybody just rock tonight
Everybody just bounce if ye feeling hype
Everybody just rock tonight
Everybody just bounce if ye feeling hype

Can I get a 4,3,2,1 check it?
Can I get a chic,chic,chic on the record?
Give me that, give me that, summer time Miramax
Parties in the back like a birthday bash
We got, Disco balls and crystal halls
These singles rock your faces off
Lost in the moment freeze it, hold it
Bounce for me now one time like ye own it
