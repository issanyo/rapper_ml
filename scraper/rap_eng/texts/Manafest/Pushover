What you want with me this time
You tailing me all night
I know you want to see me patrolled
You hi-jacking my joy ride
I'm living a good life
Why can't you leave me alone

You don't know me, no
I'm not a pushover
I'm not a pushover
You don't know me, no
I'm not a pushover
I'm not a push
You don't know me, no
I'm not a pushover
I'm not a pushover
You can't fill these shoes
You can't make me move
I'm not a pushover
I'm not a pushover

You thought youâ€™d catch you a wild one
Thinking I got some
Someone's getting fired tonight
You profile to arrest me
Or looking to test me
Sorry but you're out of time

You don't know me, no
I'm not a pushover
I'm not a pushover
You don't know me, no
I'm not a pushover
I'm not a push
You don't know me, no
I'm not a pushover
I'm not a pushover
You can't fill these shoes
You can't make me move
I'm not a pushover
I'm not a pushover

I
Won't
Play
Your
Games
Just let me be

You don't know me, no
I'm not a pushover
I'm not a pushover
You don't know me, no
I'm not a pushover
I'm not a push
You don't know me, no
I'm not a pushover
I'm not a pushover
You can't fill these shoes
You can't make me move
I'm not a pushover
I'm not a pushover
