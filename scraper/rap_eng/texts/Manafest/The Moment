[Verse 1:]
Crazy dreams, a thousand rings
Saying things is it just a dream
Did I make it up did I paint enough
Do I keep it shut do I let it rust
If I write it down it’ll happen
Shout it out taking action
Ambition taking over
Every goal getting closer
What I want, and what I am
And when I get the call
Deals are on the table about to bust
Upon a million
Manifest a destiny
Pressure standing next to me
Praying for a century
You’ll never get the best of me

[Chorus:]
All I need is the moment
Own it
No money can buy me peace of mind
Opportunities open, golden
But
No offer could make me
Sell my life
Always more to gain
Get ahead, get ahead
To the front of the line
But
There’s always a price to pay
I’ll never cash it in for the win
Throw the fight
Sell my life
Do it, do it won’t do it for the money
Do it, do it won’t do it for the money

[Verse 2:]
Cashing out stake the ground
Hit it down come on bounce
Run the mile stick it out
Life is wild don’t doubt
Life that’s been giving I’m living
Thinking of quitting you kidding
Going the distance I’m sprinting, swinging
Forever comitted
It’s been a little crazy did a lot of praying
I’m hearing you hating saying mistakingly
Things and thinking your dreams can be what
Faith takes it I’m patient put ye hand down
Pick yourself don’t sell out

[Chorus]

[Bridge:]
Cause
I don’t know where my head is
I’m leaning for the medicine
I’m feaning for a sedative
I’m screaming like a president
It’s addictive this music
It’s a mission I’m trading
My life away

[Chorus]
