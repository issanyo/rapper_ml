[Verse 1]
I thought I'd seen it all, but I didn't
Floods came, crashed in the distance
Sometimes we fall, we're not finished
This is a call, keep living
Earthquakes and cries from the righteous
But we unite and rise in the crisis
Tell them all this is who I am
I speak love and peace for Japan

[Pre-Chorus]
恐れても
ふるえても
倒れても
それでも won't break
You won't break

[Chorus]
立ち上がれ
You will rise again
You're a fighter
キミは fighter
Don't be afraid to stand
末来へ Japan

[Verse 2]
Burned up the past, rise from the ash
Fade it to black, we won't collapse
I see clear skies on the map
No fear tonight, hold fast
Cold world never looking back
Rebuild our dreams, how's that?
I believe in God, we can beat the odds
To the stars, Japan, hold on

[Pre-Chorus]
恐れても
ふるえても
倒れても
それでも won't break
You won't break

[Chorus]
立ち上がれ
You will rise again
You're a fighter
キミは fighter
Don't be afraid to stand
末来へ Japan
You're a fighter
キミは fighter

[Bridge]
Stand and fight, we gotta get up
Crossed the line, can't give up
Won't run away, we'll stand in faith
Too far to quit, gotta man up
Now's the time, gotta stand up

[Chorus]
立ち上がれ
You will rise again
You're a fighter
キミは fighter
Don't be afraid to stand
末来へ Japan
You're a fighter
キミは fighter

[Outro]
Don't be afraid to stand
末来へ Japan
You're a fighter
キミは fighter
Oh, oh, oh, oh
