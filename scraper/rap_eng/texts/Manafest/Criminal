[Verse 1:]
Still alive not luck I’m 85
Still staring in the book of life
Since 1989
Still I speak my mind god is love
And it’s a crime
If I die it’s on the line in heaven I’m doing fine
Cause I don’t want to be counted
With the cowards
Stand by to get shrouded dis empowered
If it’s time then I’ll go if it’s my hour
You can come down and take me
If I’m a
Hear the bell ring and the times now
Will you stand up or just bow down
If the gun clicks chic, chic plow
Did you get lost are you a sell out
Cause I don’t want to be counted
With the cowards
Stand by to get shrouded dis empowered
If it’s time then I’ll go if it’s my hour
You can come down and take me if I’m a

[Chorus:]
Criminal
I can’t change and
I walk away
They say I’m a criminal
Cause I walk in a different way
They say
I’m a criminal
I’m not ashamed and
I’m still the same
They say
I’m a criminal
A criminal

[Verse 2:]
Jesus, Jesus, between two thieves
Saved in the last second sinner like me
Hold your flag high don’t go hide
Pop it out, pop bring it out
They came announced
They said shut your mouth I say shut them down
I say kick them out
Cause I don’t want to be counted
With the cowards
Stand by to get shrouded dis empowered
If it’s time then I’ll go if it’s my hour
You can come down and take me if I’m a

[Chorus]

[Bridge:]
I’m walking in my faith
And knocking hard against the gates
Across the 48 states hands raised
I got chased
But I’ll be praying till the day
I watch hell fade away
It’s a shame sin stains
Step back and take aim
Hunger game style from a child
Wanna take me
I won’t bow down understand
Ye can’t make me
David & Goliath I’m a shepherd boy baby
Take the highest I’m a man god raised me
