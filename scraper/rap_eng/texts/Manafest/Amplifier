[Verse 1: Manafest & Alicia Simila]
I hear a sound break through the crowd
Through all the noise
Playing in my head, playing in my head
In my head
You pull me close, I can't say no
You are the voice
Playing in my head, playing in my head
In my head

[Pre-Chorus: Manafest & Alicia Simila]
Saying, "Ooh"
And the music plays, and the music plays
Ooh
When you say my name, you say my name

[Chorus: Manafest]
You and me tonight, we turn it up
We don't care, we might just blow it up
Your love has got me wired
Heart beats like an amplifier
Here the drums, the bass, fast and louder
You're electric, I can feel the power
Your love has got me wired
Heart beats like an amplifier

[Post-Chorus: Manafest]
Oh, oh turn it up
Amp-amp-amp-amp-amplifier
Oh, oh turn it up
Amp-amp-amp-amp-amplifier

[Verse 2: Manafest & Alicia Simila]
When I hear a song, the chaos is gone
Whispers your voice
Saying in my head, always in my head
In my head
I can't forget the feeling I get
The music surrounds
Got you in my head, got you in my head
In my head

[Pre-Chorus: Manafest & Alicia Simila]
Saying, "Ooh"
And the music plays, and the music plays
Ooh
When you say my name, you say my name

[Chorus: Manafest]
You and me tonight, we turn it up
We don't care, we might just blow it up
Your love has got me wired
Heart beats like an amplifier
Here the drums, the bass, fast and louder
You're electric, I can feel the power
Your love has got me wired
Heart beats like an amplifier

[Bridge: Manafest]
Your love has got me wired
You set my heart on fire
Don't let the music stop
Stop, stop and play it again
Your love has got me wired
You [?] like [?]
Don't let the music stop
Stop, stop and play it again

[Refrain: Alicia Simila]
Ooh
(2x)

[Chorus: Manafest]
You and me tonight, we turn it up
We don't care, we might just blow it up
Your love has got me wired
Heart beats like an amplifier
Here the drums, the bass, fast and louder
You're electric, I can feel the power
Your love has got me wired
Heart beats like an amplifier

[Outro: Manafest]
Oh, oh turn it up
Heart beats like an amplifier
Oh, oh turn it up
Heart beats like an amplifier
(2x)
You make my heart beat like an amplifier
