[Chorus]
I won't give up
(8x)

[Verse 1]
Break the habit, break my actions
Take the pain, dear God I'm askin'
Gimme a hall pass, gimme just one
One more chance, Imma outrun
The devil can't dance, I got a gun
Put it to his head, click click and done
The dying in me, slaid and empty
The god of envy, you're just a memory
It's never too late, can't stop me now
It's not too late, love holds no bounds
I start to faint and I'm fallin' down
I hit rock bottom then I came around

[Pre-Chorus]
You build me up when I break down
You take my hand when I'm alone
You pull me out when I fall in
You heal the scars that leave my skin

[Chorus]
I won't give up
(8x)

[Verse 2]
Burn it down, kick the ashes
I wear a badge, did a lot of askin'
Ask myself am I really done
Kick myself, stop actin' dumb
If I had known, I'd never left
Stupid, stupid, should've been dead
I took a stand, held my tongue
Spit my thorns and learn to love
I Got the nerve, got my [?]
Gotta God got a hold of me
It's never too late, can't stop me now
It's not too late, love knows no bounds
I start to faint and I'm fallin' down
I hit rock bottom then I came around

[Pre-Chorus]
You build me up when I break down
You take my hand when I'm alone
You pull me out when I fall in
You heal the scars that leave my skin

[Chorus]
I won't give up
(8x)

[Bridge]
Won't give up
Get up one more time
Escape this sleepless night
I'm walkin' to the light
Leave it all behind
If I could get up one more time
Leave it all behind
Walkin' to the light

[Pre-Chorus]
You build me up when I break down
You take my hand when I'm alone
You pull me out when I fall in
You heal the scars that leave my skin

[Chorus]
I won't give up
(8x)
