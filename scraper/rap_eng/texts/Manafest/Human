[Verse 1]
Hey, I never said I was an angel, no
I never said I wouldn't break down, yeah
Beside myself, living in a cold cell
Don't shut me out
Yeah, you look at me like I'm a stranger
Yeah, you make me feel like I betrayed you
Don't leave me stranded
As I reach out my hand

[Chorus]
Cause I wear my heart on my sleeve
If you cut me I'll bleed
I know I cannot erase
Every mistake that I've made
I never said I was an angel
No I never said I wouldn't break down
But life keeps on moving
By now you should know
I'm only human
Hey, hey, hey I'm only human
Hey, hey, hey

[Verse 2]
Hey, got any grace for a failure?
Cause I'm feeling like I failed you
Yeah, I lashed out, digging up my past
Oh, I know let you down, yeah
Oh, I'm still fighting for the future
Yeah, cause I never wanna lose you
I'll keep on climbing If you're on my side

[Chorus]
Cause I wear my heart on my sleeve
If you cut me I'll bleed
I know I cannot erase
Every mistake that I've made
I never said I was an angel, no
I never said I wouldn't break down
But life keeps on moving
By now you should know
I'm only human
Hey, hey, hey I'm only human
Hey, hey, hey

[Bridge]
I know I'm breaking your heart
Every storm that tears us apart
I know I'm to blame for all the damage I've done
But you know that I'm ready to take the fall
I never said I was angel
I never said I wouldn't break down

[Chorus]
Cause I wear my heart on my sleeve
If you cut me I'll bleed
I know I cannot erase
Every mistake that I've made
I never said I was an angel, no
I never said I wouldn't break down
But life keeps on moving
By now you should know
I'm only human
Hey, hey, hey I'm only human
Hey, hey, hey I'm only human
Hey, hey, hey I'm only human
