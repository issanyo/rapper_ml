[Verse 1: Manafest]
Hoping it’ll change, but it always stays the same
Leave me with the crumbs, starving out in the rain
I thought you’d come to me
Now the vibes like ye stuck with me
There's no love anymore
No more meant to be's
Self pity, got me thinking dang she's so pretty
Stitching every inch of my heart
How dumb is he?
Yeah
There were moments when I thought we had it
Moments when I thought of marriage
Look how long we lasted
I'm weighing the scales while ya painting your nails
It's story tell
Left this in the mail
I thought I could wait
For as long as it takes
But I'm on the last train
And it's leaving at 8
I thought I could wait for as long as it takes
But I'm on the last train
And it's leaving at 8
Yeah it's leaving at 8

[Chorus: Manafest]
I thought I could wait
For as long as it takes
But I'm on the last train tonight
On the last train, on the last train
(2x)

[Verse 2: Manafest]
Life's not a race
Re-thinking my mistakes
Patience is bitter, but it's fruit has taste
My heads in wrinkles a nd my heart lost faith
We could of been a match made in heaven
Maybe
Could of had a house on the hills
Babies
It was all a dream in my mind
Fading
Praying God show me that sign
Save me
Rain drops falling
And I'm crawling from the bottom
Try to turn a corner, but my clutch keeps stalling
Pulling in my drive way, your car pulls behind me
Smile on your face and your wearing my diamond
I said I would wait
For as long as it takes
Then you said "Yes"
So were setting a date
I thought I could wait

[Chorus: Manafest]
I thought I could wait
For as long as it takes
But I'm on the last train tonight
On the last train, on the last train
(2x)

[Breakdown: DJ Versatile]

[Chorus: Manafest]
I thought I could wait
For as long as it takes
But I'm on the last train tonight
On the last train, on the last train
(2x)
