[Verse 1]
You found me on the streets
5 steps from Queen's
With my hat out
Begging oh I’m begging please
Climbed the mezzanine
The edge of broken dreams
Before I jumped
Saw your hand reach down for me
Pulling on my strings
Falling on my knees
Nothing left to speak
I’m at your mercy
Heart of a lion
Gave it all I can
If I’m calm as a riot
Why stay and keep trying

[Chorus]
I’m holding on
Holding my tongue
Cause I was wrong
Love broke my heart wide open
Love broke my heart wide open
I’m holding on
Holding my tongue
Cause I was wrong
This is my song
Love broke my heart wide open
Love broke my heart wide open
Love broke my heart wide open
Love broke my heart wide open
Love broke my heart wide open
Love broke my heart wide open

[Verse 2]
When I feel defeat
That’s when I hear you speak
One touch of your hand
And it gives me peace
Now that I can sing
The sun ray of spring
Like a warm coat
Arms stretched over me
Pulling on my strings
Falling on my knees
Nothing left to speak
I’m at your mercy
Heart of a lion
Gave it all I can
If I’m calm as a riot
Why stay and keep trying

[Chorus]
I’m holding on
Holding my tongue
Cause I was wrong
Love broke my heart wide open
Love broke my heart wide open
I’m holding on
Holding my tongue
Cause I was wrong
This is my song
Love broke my heart wide open
Love broke my heart wide open
Love broke my heart wide open
Love broke my heart wide open
Love broke my heart wide open
Love broke my heart wide open

[Bridge]
Cold but I love how your arms they hold me
Cold but I love how your arms they hold me
Love wide open, love wide open
Oh how ye love broke my heart wide open
Love wide open, love wide open
Oh how ye love broke my heart wide open

[Chorus]
I’m holding on
Holding my tongue
Cause I was wrong
Love broke my heart wide open
Love broke my heart wide open
I’m holding on
Holding my tongue
Cause I was wrong
This is my song
Love broke my heart wide open
Love broke my heart wide open
Love broke my heart wide open
Love broke my heart wide open
Love broke my heart wide open
Love broke my heart wide open
