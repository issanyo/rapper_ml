[Verse 1]
I thought I knew it all, but i didn't
I thought I'd seen it all, just beginning
Sometimes we fall before the finish
This ain't a call, It's just realness
I never knew my dad, I'd just hide it
I never took a class, I just write it
Sometimes I don't like what I see
Sometimes it's so hard to believe

[Pre-Chorus]
Down and out, I
Start to doubt, I
Hit the ground, I'm bruised
But I won't break
I won't break

[Chorus]
You can say I'm done
But this has just begun
I'm a fighter
I'm a fighter
I'm not afraid of death
You ain't seen nothin' yet

[Verse 2]
Burned up my past
Pushed on the gas
Took off my mask
Still all in black
If I don't know I just ask
I'm a grown man sold as
Cold world never looking back
Went and got my stripes paid cash
I believe in God
I can beat the odds
You'll see me on the screen
In gauze

[Pre-Chorus]
Down and out, I
Start to doubt, I
Hit the ground, I'm bruised
But I won't break
I won't break

[Chorus]
You can say I'm done
But this has just begun
I'm a fighter!
I'm a fighter!
I'm not afraid of death
You ain't seen nothin' yet
I'm a fighter
I'm a fighter

[Bridge]
Stand and fight
Gotta get up
Crossed the line
Can't give up
Won't run away
From my enemy
Too far to quit
Gotta man up
Now's the time
Gotta stand up

[Chorus]
You can say I'm done
But this has just begun
I'm a fighter
I'm a fighter
I'm not afraid of death
You ain't seen nothin' yet
I'm a fighter
I'm a fighter
