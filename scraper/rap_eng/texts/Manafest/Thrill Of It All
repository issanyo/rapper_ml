[Intro:]
Thrill of it all
Thrill of it all
Thrill of it all
For the thrill of it all
Gonna set it off

[Verse 1:]
Eh yo
Crisp denim round my waist
Fashion never plays it safe
3 stripe color ways
Risk is in my DNA
Human so I cut & paste
Using every ounce a faith
Counting every second
Eh
On to big and better ways
I got a letter from my father
And I bothered to read it
Became an author and bleeded
I gave a promise
I promise stay dope
Not sell dope
Promise to love, hope
Give back to my kin folk
It’s no joke

[Chorus:]
How high you gonna go this time
This time I made up my mind
I fly
For the thrill of it all
Thrill of it all
How high you gonna go this time
This time I made up my mind
I fly
For the thrill of it all
Thrill of it all
For the thrill gonna set it off

[Verse 2:]
Extreme dreaming
I’m leaning in
This life turns
Try not to swerve
(urt)
It hurts
Head first
I’m going in, going in
All the way, segway
Clipping off the dead weight
Try to keep my head straight
Good choice, bad choice
I have a voice
I want to hear that a boy
Not just that I’m making noise
Joy abounds loud
Jumped out the crowd
Tickle me proud
Give me some daps & pounds

[Chorus:]
How high you gonna go this time
This time I made up my mind
I fly
For the thrill of it all
Thrill of it all
How high you gonna go this time
This time I made up my mind
I fly
For the thrill of it all
Thrill of it all
For the thrill gonna set it off

[Bridge:]
Stay steady with it
Don’t let it slip a minute
Stay steady with it
Don’t ever want to come down
I don’t want to come down
Stay steady with it
Don’t let it slip a minute
Stay steady with it
Don’t ever want to come down
I don’t want to come down
Thrill of it all
Thrill of it all

[Chorus]
