Verse I

I made the jump in 2000
To see if I can climb up this mountain
Every day seems like a thousand
Every year I'm hit I keep bouncing
Even if I'm hit I keep bouncing

I don't like it, but it don't phase me
I could complain but I keep playing
The games crazy run for safety
I live it daily, in choices no chances
Suck your thumb or start standing
Look up at the world, there's opportunities, girl
The possibilities stir, me up I'm willing to learn
I'm just saying

I want it all, cash, clothes, and the gold
I want it all, 1 wife, 3 kids and a home
I want it all, God show me the road
I want it all but won't forfeit my soul
I want freedom

Chorus

Free!!
All I want is to be Free
In your arms I'm gonna be
That's where I'm free
And I'm breaking down the walls
Just set me Free

Oh, oh, ho, oh, ho, ho, oh

I just got to believe that a, a, one day I'll be free uh huh, yeah

Verse II

I got so many things that I could scream about
But got too many dreams I can't leave them now
In my struggle and stress I wouldn't leave the house
In the hustle no rest I couldn't free myself
I was clouded, I doubted, I felt surrounded
Down in a cell, I needed counseling
I could speak to five thousand
But I was still drowning help me out!!!
Here's what I think about
Giving up, no
Dying young, no
Lying tongue, no
Maybe I should cheat, and no
I read books for inspiration
My constant motivation
In the bible found salvation
My only purpose is permanence
Make your mark and take courage
I got freedom

Chorus

Free!!
All I want is to be Free
In your arms I'm gonna be
That's where I'm free
And I'm breaking down the walls
Just set me Free

Oh, oh, ho, oh, ho, ho, oh

BRIDGE

We all searching for peace, I just got to believe that a, a
I just got a believe, one day I'll be free uh, yeah
We all searching for peace, I just got to believe that a, a
Uh uh, yeah
Oh oh, oh.. singing....

Set me free
