[Verse 1]:
It's funny I never thought that I'd be homeless
I used to walk by them, now I'm living on the corners
Stretching for a touch of a hand, a dollar bill or a chance
Give me your sandwich bag, man I'll do anything
With thoughts of desperation my hearts racing
I'm not star gazing I could die of starvation
Hallucinated from the day's wasted
Lost track of time while my mind aging
People looking at me like a lost patient
Like I'm already dead why they all hating
Did I choose this life, or life choose me
I ran away at sweet 16 mommy do you miss me, this is Krissy

[Hook]:
So I run, and I run, and I ran and I ran praying maybe some day we meet again
Cause It hurts when you hurt, and I hurt and I feel, like I'm healed can we all just make a mends
I run and I run and I run, and I run

[Verse 2]:
Good bye to the world, good bye to my girl
Say hello to my home the street corner
Its absurd every word that was spoken
It must come alive cause my life is still broken
Wondering did I miss it, what mistake did I make? Can I fix it?
These streets of gone ballistic
This isn't what I thought it would be, where's daddy
Is he still mad at me, I wonder would he have me
Back in the home, back in the zone, back where I can't eat
Where's there's heat and use a phone
Cause it hurts and I know I never said good bye
I ran away I thought like anything I could fly

[Hook]:
So I run, and I run, and I ran and I ran praying maybe some day we meet again
Cause It hurts when you hurt, and I hurt and I feel, like I'm healed can we all just make a mends
I run and I run and I run, and I run

[Verse 3]:
Mom and dad are you there, are you listening
I want to come home, but scared of the mess I'm in
Please forgive me of the things I committed
Against you against me, our family tree
And I know we haven't spoke in so long, I was so wrong
To think I could live on, on my own accord
I'm a take the train home, but I need to know
If you'll welcome me back through your life's door?
Show me a sign with a red ribbon, hang one on the side of the train building
And if I see it than I'll know that your still willing
And if not I won't ever call or visit
I'll pretend that I'm re-living the beginning
Like when we used talk in the kitchen, without all the fights and friction
This is me wishing, one of your ex children
Picturing praying that you got the same feelings
I'm running

[Hook]:
So I run, and I run, and I ran and I ran praying maybe some day we meet again
Cause It hurts when you hurt, and I hurt and I feel, like I'm healed can we all just make a mends
I run and I run and I run, and I run
