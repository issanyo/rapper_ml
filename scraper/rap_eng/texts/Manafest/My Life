Verse I
Sometimes I feel like I want to quit
No one will notice if
I forfeit my soul blow myself with a clip
That's my father did no gun, a noose and he hung
My mom found him in the basement there as he swung
At 5 years old what does that do to a kid
Produced a maniac anthrax type of a kid
I hear an ambulance, sirens I'm told to be silent
I'm blind trying to find why my house is a riot
Got to go can't take it, Uncle Dave's face is changing
I race to find my father in the bottom of the basement
My mothers covered in tears her face filling with fear
Bang's on the floor shout's to God why am I are hear
Scared to even ask, where my dad is at the time
I guess for now it's just a memory

Mom where's dad, where is he mom, where's dad
No

Chorus
This is my life my world
My nightmare stuck here won't turn
Is there a light that can shine on me?
Dear God I pray you hear hommie
This is Chris your son praying feeling so lonely
My life my world
My nightmare stuck here won't turn

Verse II
Can you relate to me? Probably not
You still hate ye father, wanna to kill ye mom
Got a dad attacking in the night at around 1:00
Feet are like drums coming to you, ye can't run
Struggle with the thoughts, am I normal or not
Abused all my life even when I called out to God
What the flip, it's a shame what happens in the dark
Invisible to people all they seeing is the scars
Hold on yo, use gonna make it
Your spirit can't be broken, soul not taken
Praying in the power of the tongue for my friends
New Testament Jesus Christ let him in
Ye brains still confused what am I suppose to do
When ye folks choke, tie vocal ropes around you
Walls fall down surround you forget living I'll never fitting
God's love is real no matter what you've ever been in

Chorus
This is my life my world
My nightmare stuck here won't turn
Is there a light that can shine on me?
Dear God I pray you hear hommie
This is Chris your son praying feeling so lonely

My life my world
My nightmare stuck here won't turn
Is there a light that can shine bright won't burn?
Afterlife when I see Christ Soul journ

Bridge
This is my life lord can ye shine on me
Can anybody hear me?
Lord can you save me?

Verse III
Have you ever felt like you wanna die?
End in the night, say good bye like a Lola bye
And just close ye eyes
Those lies almost killed me
Feeling filthy, no ability to move
Commit suicide I won't be guilty
There's no perfect life, it's all media hype
The TV screen's feeding ye right
I've seen both sides of it by now, I would a bowed down
A new sound the lost can be found
You're in some real dirt, ye life kind a sucks
Ye might adjust, but you'd rather die in the dust
I've had enough I look to him, and in God I trust
Sometimes it gets rough but ye can't give up
