I got one chick, no kids no drama
I soak in, music sing soap operas
I got four wheels one board globe trotter
I got money got God I still got problems
It don't matter though I'm zoned in my own flow
So when I get told off my emotions hold
I don't punch a whole through the bathroom door
I count to four 1,2,3,4!!!
Cause If I don't calm down, stress is gonna compound
Cops are gonna come down, cuff me up g style
Buck wild like hulk I'll turn green
Pray for me "AH" there's animal inside of me
I drop a rhyme, hard flip hit a grind
Turn 360 degrees adrenalin ride
Let these hammers fall flat, conscience intact
Cause all around the world we gonna feel the impact

New York dropping hammers like what
California dropping hammers like what
Manafest Dropping hammers on anybody crazy enough to get down
America dropping hammers like what
Worldwide dropping hammers like what
Manafest Dropping hammers on anybody crazy enough to get down

I can't tell you that I've never been ticked off
Picked on, spit upon felt ripped off
I've had my mom rip me a new one
For a quick tongue, run, kid, run, run, run
Sun don't shine in my life all the time
Some fly, some die, some survive the ride
Christ got my back when I fall face flat
When the fault line cracks I bounce right back
I used to freak out scream loud I need help
Beat down the ground till my fists were ow
Now I got bolder got wisdom got style
I used to miss out now I'm Mr. Wow
Blow to your radio Blow to your video
Dropping these hammers like what
I said Blow to your radio to Blow to your Video
Dropping these hammers right now on your stereo

We dropping hammers, like it don't matter
Setting the standard
We dropping hammers, like it don't matter
Raising the banner

Ye can't pigeon hole me, hommie
Sorry can't do what you told me, I'm only
Doing what I feel, what's right? What's wrong?
When I'm dropping it hard somewhere I belong, I hear God
Talking to me, while I'm falling asleep, I got cuts in my knees
After hitting the streets trying to figure out the following
Why me, why not, Thank God, this is life drop it like it's
