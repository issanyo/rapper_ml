The sun is shining like it's gonna be a good day
My girl's smiling likes it's gonna be a good day
Ain't' gonna be stressing out, I'm gonna twist and shout
It's gonna be a good day, a good day

Verse I
I'm walking out the door
Don't know what's in store
I got my sneakers on
I'm feeling like I'm steaming hot
I jump in my car, oh dang it's 9'0clock
I see a finger flip my mirror like it's my fault
To the left, left, turn to the right, right
I better step, step, fast caught another light
I got 5 little itty bitty minutes
To pick, pick it, pick it up, or I'm finished
Yeah, I'm a little misunderstood I'd change it if I could
But I know it's gonna be all gggg-good

Chorus:
It's gonna be a good day, a good day
It's gonna be a good day, a good day
When things are going my way, my way
It's gonna be good, gggg-good

Whatever comes my way, it's gonna be a good day
It's gonna be okay, it's gonna be a good
Because I know it's gonna be a good, good day
It's gonna be a good day, a good day
Verse II
Again I'm late for work
I'm feeling like a jerk
I wanna curse and go berserk
And kick some furniture (KICK IT)
I see my boss, he sees me
I see the clock, I can't leave
He waves me over coming closer
I wipe the dirt off my shoulders
Take a deep, deep breath, let it go
Don't freak out get control
Don't w, w w, worry, I warned ye
Can't let this stress get on ye
Sh, sh, shake it off, br, br, break it off
Superstitious, knock on wood
Don't worry it's all good

Chorus:
It's gonna be a good day, a good day
It's gonna be a good day, a good day
When things are going my way, my way
It's gonna be good, gggg-good

Whatever comes my way
The sun is shining like it's gonna be a good day
It's gonna be ok
My girls smiling like it's gonna be a good
Because I know it's gonna be a good, good day
Ain't gonna be stressing out, I'm gonna twist and shout
It's gonna be a good day, a good day
