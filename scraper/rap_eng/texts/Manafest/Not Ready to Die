[Hook]
Breathe, reflect in between my rhymes
Don't know if tomorrow will be my time
Release, ye whole mind body and soul
Up in your zone this world's out a control
Cause If I die before I wake
Pray to God my soul he takes
I got one life, one heart, one mind
I'm not ready die, let's stay alive

[Verse 1]
Why would I lie if I know it's true?
If I'm wrong than I'm wrong than I say that's cool
It's the law of the earth that'll kill me first
It's the God of the universe who saved my birth
Not cocky, not watching, I don't care if yall diss
I got 100 verses 40 songs take ye pick
Average man lives to 65, I got 9 lives
Courtesy of Christ I'm a use all 9
So find me atrocious, I rhyme with emotion
I'm floating in here you better come up for air
You got cash, clothes, a chick, Zero percent
With crack up ye nose bro it don't make sense
And it's been that way you're not D.O.A (dead on arrival)
Yo, did you hear me this life is getting scary
Know what you're about not just knowledge of self
You got one chance to play, and ya cards are dealt

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
I can't be held down, to your worldly styles
Get up and bounce Ricochet off my sound
I ain't ready to die
I got mileage to ride
I stopped playing with yall, Between hating my God
Figured him on my side, I could fly or walk the waters
Heal his daughters you've never seen an artist
To spit this truth, this year, kill fear
I'm the new pioneer, and I'm still a kid

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
I ain't got time to waste, this be the last one
The outcome of life I'm unsure, I'm not done
Leave yall a message, and answer some questions
The who what why we here
Why's there fear, if I die, do I rise like birds of the air?
My opinion is clear, in position to care
I can't give it away give it away
What they say can't make or break me
Save me before I start changing
Earthlings I want to hear you'll sing
Stretch ye life out long, I wanna see it bling
Cause if I die I know what's on the other side
One life one God, and I'm flying high

[Hook]
