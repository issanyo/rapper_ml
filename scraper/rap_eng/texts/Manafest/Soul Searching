(Verse 1)
Im on a thin line in my life
Walking through the darkness at the speed of light
Every day I separate my mom from the night
It's steer God more christ when the viper strikes
Sike courage from a soul search is to find purpose
In the universe of broken circuits
What's my purpose?
Am I worthless?
Who's christ?
Yo, I the one who built the churches
Shall I die, now I close the curtains
I don't know (I don't know)
What I'm seeking (What' I'm seeking)
Looking for (Looking for)
Tryna find (Tryna find)
I don't know (I don't know)
What I'm searching (What I'm searching)
Looking for (Looking for)
A piece of mind
My folks traveled distance
Stimulate a pictured image of a god
Who is is?
Forgive my sins committed
Visions while I'm sleeping
Like I never woke up after dreaming
Now it's time to start screaming got me thinking
What I believe in
A sole traveler
Unraveling truth in my days on the calendar
Distant to see the light that shine less before me now
I'm older now, nothing in this world that can hold me down
Through the shadow of the valley it's a fine evil
People lie, can't trust, I define lethal
Lacking knowledge of self within
Drifting to sin
Purpose of life living
My souls missing link escaped out of prison
I want the true story (?) told from the beginning
(Hook)
I lay awake in bed at night (laying awake)
Thinking about all the times that I lied (all the times)
I know that there's more to this life (There's more to this)
Something within me keeps me searching (Keeps me searching)
(Verse 2)
What's unpredictable
My life's quest for the spiritual essence
I met God, cleared up my questions
Profession of sin, my past life on the classifieds
Off the dark side cutting through like a samurai
Testify with adrenaline, I found the last element
Open the book, new testament
"Dear God, I repent for the things I've done
You gave me peace from a father to a son
Your eyes that cried when I lied (I never knew that)
You died but rised on the 3rd (I never knew that)
Cause when I die my souls alive fortified
I seen your eyes
Got your strength to survive
(Outro)
I lay awake in bed at night (laying awake)
Thinking about all the times that I (all the times)
I know that there's more to this life (There's more to this)
Something within me keeps me searching (Keeps me searching)
Now I know you are there for me (You are there for me)
You're the reason I've been searching (Searching)
I don't know
Something within me (Thank you God)
Searching (Searching)
Searching (Searching)
You're within me
All the times that I (all the times)
All the times that I (all the times)
There's more to this life (There's more)
Something within me (You're within me God)
You're within me
