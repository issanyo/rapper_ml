[Verse 1: Manafest]
Big brother told me ye gotta shine on
Told me no way your gonna die young
You'll live a long life
Have a cute wife
Be that bright star
Shine in the moon light
Go get it
Go get it
I'm with it, he said it
Uh huh
Is it a grammy
Am I preaching
Is it an oscar
Kids call me father?
Feeling like Steve Jobs
Only got one chance
One shot, one life
Don't wanna mess it up
When the stakes are up
Won't spill my cup
When I owe too much

[Pre-Chorus: Manafest]
Not going sulk and worry about it
Imma stand up and shout about it
Find the girl and hold her around me
Get stoked cause you know

[Chorus: Trevor McNevan]
I wanna shine in the light
Glow in the dark
Strike like a match on a burnin' heart
Shine like the sun
Light up the globe
Cuz momma didn't raise no rollin' stone

[Verse 3: Manafest]
Big sister called me the hero
You can save us all from zero
No cape or super powers
But fears it cowers
And faith it showers
No savior
But I'll be your neighbor
Help those from here to asia
Just call like ye need a favor
High five till I see ye later
Oh oh oh ok, ok
Missed it today
No way
Pick up where I left off
Shine on, shine on
Army style re-con
Time on, time on
Only get one chance, one shot
One life, can’t stop
Don’t wanna mess it up
When the stakes are up
Won’t spill my cup
When I owe too much, hey

[Chorus: Trevor McNevan]
I wanna shine in the light
Glow in the dark
Strike like a match on a burnin' heart
Shine like the sun
Light up the globe
Cuz momma didn't raise no rollin' stone
Shine in the light
Glow in the dark
Strike like a match on a burnin' heart
Shine like the sun
Light up the globe
Cuz momma didn't raise no rollin' stone

[Bridge: Manafest]
You raised me, saved me
I'm never alone
I gave it, made it
Not on my own
Sometimes when I feel alone
Get so low like I'm in a zone
Fell asleep like a week ago
Woke up tripping like where'd I go

[Chorus: Trevor McNevan]
I wanna shine in the light
Glow in the dark
Strike like a match on a burnin' heart
Shine like the sun
Light up the globe
Cuz momma didn't raise no rollin' stone
Shine in the light
Glow in the dark
Strike like a match on a burnin' heart
Shine like the sun
Light up the globe
Cuz momma didn't raise no rollin' stone

[Outro: Manafest]
Momma raised some crazy dudes
Trevor & Mana
Teerawk, wassup?
Woo...
