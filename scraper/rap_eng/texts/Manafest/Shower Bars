[Freestyle - Toumi]
Common knowledge, A.T, breathe fire, man, ergo
Wake up everyday in the mornin' there's an inferno
Who should I throw on today, I'm partial to Kano
With the fire situation, I should live in a volcano

Dummies don't understand my lyrics but what would they know
Catch me rubbin my hands together as if i'm rolling play dough
Enjoy what I do and now I need to make the play-dough
But i'm serious with the lyrics like, I ain't come to play though

Too many up and comers say they wanna do a track with me
Pencil them in and I try and book them a feature
But see, they ain't as hungry as me so they don't turn up
And so I'm rapping by myself while they're at home bunnin' the reefer

Safe
If you'd rather puff upon the 'erb
Than come into the studio and lay me down a verse
You'll be dreamin til your withered, til you die, until you're old
See I don't just dream big, I achieve my goals

And I ain't talking 'bout my brows bein on fleek
Talking catch me up on everest and it's all peak
