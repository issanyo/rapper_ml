Verse I

There've been days I lost my way and backed down
Time I wasted, placed you in the background
I can't take it, parade and fake this
Separated tainted, it's got me on the run now
I don't want to be on the run now
Create a love in me I'll put it all down
Shake the pain, replace it let me run now
Faith is waiting I'm facing what's in front now

Pre-Chorus

It's not like I'm not trying to work it out
If things are, so much harder when you're not around

Chorus:
I'm not always who you think I am
Sometimes I feel like I'm the renegade
And I can't just sit back and watch it fade
This time I hope you see, I'm not the enemy

Verse II
I'm gone a make it, shake it on the jump now
I'm gone a break it, fade it put the gun down
Amazing grace, mistakes erased come round
I'm gonna do what it takes, remain and run in the race
Saved a wretch like me you never let down
I can see the dream I'll never let drowned
I'm not a saint but hey I'm up above ground
I'm now awake I'll chase I'll never run out

Pre-Chorus

It's not like I'm not trying to work it out
If things are, so much harder when you're not around

Chorus:
I'm not always who you think I am
Sometimes I feel like I'm the renegade
And I can't just sit back and watch it fade
This time I hope you see, I'm not the enemy

BRIDGE:
I'm not a renegade, I'm not a renegade, no matter what you say
I'm not a renegade, I'm not a renegade, no matter what you say, I'm not a renegade
I'm not a renegade, I'm not a renegade, no matter what you say, I'm not a renegade!!!!
I'm not a renegade!!!

Pre-Chorus

It's not like I'm not trying to work it out
If things are, so much harder when you're not around

Chorus:
I'm not always who you think I am
Sometimes I feel like I'm the renegade
And I can't just sit back and watch it fade
This time I hope you see I'm not the enemy

I'm not a renegade, I'm not a renegade, no matter what you say, I'm not a renegade
I'm not a renegade, I'm not a renegade, no matter what you say, I'm not a renegade!!!!
