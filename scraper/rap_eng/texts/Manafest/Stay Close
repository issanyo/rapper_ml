[Verse 1]
The dreams not dead, it's just stuck in my head
They put me on meds, to try to keep me in bed
A visit from a friend gets me smiling again
But pain never ends when I'm swallowing bread
With death at my door step, any regrets
I thought about my girls last night and I wept

[Pre-Chorus]
Why me God? Oh, oh, oh my God
Where did I go wrong?
It's on
I'm not dead yet
So I'm I sing this song
Hold on, hold on

[Chorus]
Don't leave my side tonight
Stay close till I close my eyes
Like a hurricane life goes by
I won't stress I'm not done yet
Don't leave my side tonight
Stay close till I close my eyes
I never wanna say goodbye
Goodbye

[Verse 2]
Mom you were good to me
Always saw the good in me
Even when they couldnâ€™t see
A diamond in the dirt beneath
Life ain't fare, but dang I'm scared
God heals I believe in prayer
This room is small
There's a smell in the air
Like mothballs
And the nurses they stare
I'm writing this just in case, just in case
I don't make it out
This life don't waste
I tell every kid that lifes a gift
So go big, swing big and hit
If I knew I'd a come this far
I would of dreamed bigger
Yeah I would of dreamed bigger

[Pre-Chorus]
Why me God? Oh, oh, oh my God
Where did I go wrong?
It's on
I'm not dead yet
So I'm I sing this song
Hold on, hold on

[Chorus]
Don't leave my side tonight
Stay close till I close my eyes
Like a hurricane life goes by
I won't stress I'm not done yet
Don't leave my side tonight
Stay close till I close my eyes
I never wanna say goodbye
Goodbye

[Bridge]
My last breath
First step
No cure yet
More tests
Can't flex
I get undressed
Healed or take me now
Take me out
I wanna fight
Another round
The best's yet to come
Sticking to my guns
Run, I wanna run
Put my face in the sun
Coming to a stand still, hands chilled
Moment that a man feels
Holding on I stand healed

[Chorus]
Don't leave my side tonight
Stay close till I close my eyes
Like a hurricane life goes by
I won't stress I'm not done yet
Don't leave my side tonight
Stay close till I close my eyes
I never wanna say goodbye
Goodbye
