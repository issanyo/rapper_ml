[Hook: Manfest]
I have a dream
For every neglected child & teen
I have a dream
That I could do almost anything
I have a dream
To spread truth love & harmony
I have a dream
Where I could change the world without it changing me


[Verse 1: Manafest]
I had a dream I was flying so high
I could see and hear the nations crying out to the sky
I had a dream I could save them
No ultimatums
Bring them to a haven where the earths not shaking
Dreaming of a day where the worlds not hating
Dreaming is believing, I'm seeing salvation
New generation, stop confrontation
I can see it now were all one in the same
To no more poverty New technology
Healing our economy Someday it's got to be
Where we can all stand And march together
Sing a song of freedom Let it dominate forever

[Hook: Manfest]
I have a dream
For every neglected child & teen
I have a dream
That I could do almost anything
I have a dream
To spread truth love & harmony
I have a dream
Where I could change the world without it changing me

[Verse 2: Shonlock]
Pardon my passion an plea
How do I say politely?
We lived this nightmare long enough
I'm trying to see Martin's dream
I had a talk with a teen timid but told me some things
And it made me think about myself and how we perceive the scene
He said my mommas a fend, my daddy’s queen
Ain't never had a man in my life, left when I was 16
The streets is all that I've seen
Get up get the cream
If you get popped in the pursuit just chalk it up as routine
I'm thinking what do you mean?
Lil homie what do you mean?
More then that poverty mentality no scholarly dreams
I'm holding hope for some things
You keep the rubies and rings
My jewelry is the community how thick is the chain
I dropped my heart and picked my life up at the foot of the King
Listen close you can hear Martin sing

[Hook: Manfest]
I have a dream
For every neglected child & teen
I have a dream
That I could do almost anything
I have a dream
To spread truth love & harmony
I have a dream
Where I could change the world without it changing me

[Verse 3: Tedashii]
My dream like Dr. King's is something rarely seen
Still holding on for the day that we let freedom ring
In between, what's real and what we really need
They persecute my pain and others tell me let it be
Man please
I tried to move past it
They see my kindness but mistake it like I'm passive
Pleading with the main in the mirror, Michael Jackson
To them this freedom talk sounds funny like a accent
Yes, the cop said that this is protocol
America this system needs an overhaul
In this system I'm the underdog but, I refuse to loose
They tell me that's it's fine man it's really you
They in the matrix, that’s why kids taking
Blue pills
Truth is You can't escape it

[Hook: Manfest]
I have a dream
For every neglected child & teen
I have a dream
That I could do almost anything
I have a dream
To spread truth love & harmony
I have a dream
Where I could change the world without it changing me
