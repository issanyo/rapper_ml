[Verse 1]
Like Cleopatra got the masses at my feet
Got a living dwell down on easy street
I'm the latest craze
And if you stay a while
Inevitably, you gone be biting my style
In your later days (well, well, well)
Let me tell you what is fact and what is true
I get high and that ain’t that much to do
I'm always in a daze (uh huh)
That was just a dream I had
Last night in my bubble bath
Next to my wishing well

[Chorus]
(Get up, get out and do something)
Don't let the days of your life pass you by
Get up, get out and do something)
How will you make it if you never even try?
(Get up, get out and do something)
Can't spend your whole life trying to get high
(Get up, get out and do something)
’Cause you and I have to do for you and I

[Verse 2]
What's been happening? How you doing? Where you been
I'm further behind now than I was back then
Lost in some old maze (uh huh)
Some years have passed me by
All I want is to go get high
I'll get it together some other day

[Bridge]
In my dreams I dwell
Cause all my dreams are swell
You would too
If you could see them
That's what I know
I gotta go
Get up
Get out and (yeah)

[Middle 8]
Masses at my feet
Got a living dwell down on easy street
I'm the latest craze
That was just a dream I had
Last night in my bubble bath
Next to my wishing well

[Chorus]
(Get up, get out and do something)
Don't let the days of your life pass you by
Get up, get out and do something)
How will you make it if you never even try?
(Get up, get out and do something)
Can't spend your whole life trying to get high
(Get up, get out and do something)
’Cause you and I have to do for you and I
