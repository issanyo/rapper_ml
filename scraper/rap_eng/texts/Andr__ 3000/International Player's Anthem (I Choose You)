[Verse 1: Andre 3000]
So I typed a text to a girl I used to see
Sayin' that I chose this cutie pie with whom I wanna be
And I apologize if this message gets you down
Then I CC'ed every girl that I'd see-seed 'round town
And hate to see y'all frown but I'd rather see her smilin' Wetness all around me, true but I'm no island
Peninsula maybe, it makes no sense, I know crazy
Give up all this pussy cat that's in my lap, no lookin' back Spaceships don't come equipped with rear view mirrors
They dip as quick as they can, the atmosphere is now ripped I'm so like a pimp, I'm glad it's night
So the light from the sun would not burn me on my bum
When I shoot the moon, high jump the broom
Like a preemie out the womb, my partner yelling "too soon Don't do it! Reconsider, read some liter- -ature on the subject. You sure? Fuck it
You know we got your back like chiroprac-tic
If that bitch do you dirty we'll wipe her ass out in some detergent
Now hurry hurry go on to the altar
I know you ain't a pimp, but pimp remember what I taught ya: Keep your heart, Three Stacks, keep your heart
Hey keep your heart, Three Stacks, keep your heart
Man these girls is smart, Three Stacks, these girls is smart
Play your part...play your part."

[Verse 2: Pimp C]
(Sweet Jones)
My bitch a choosy lover, never fuck without a rubber
Never in the sheets, like it on top of the cover
Money on the dresser, drive a Kompressor
Top notch hoes get the most, not the lesser
Trash like to fuck with $40 in the club
Fuckin' up the game, bitch it gets no love
She be cross country, givin' all that she got
A thousand a pop, I'm pullin' Bentleys off the lot
I smashed up the gray one, bought me a red
Every time we hit the parkin' lot we turn head
Some hoes wanna choose but them bitches too scary
Your bitch chose me, you ain't a pimp, you a fairy

[Verse 3: Bun B]
Baby you been rollin' solo, time to get down with the team
The grass is greener on that other side, if you know what I mean
I show you shit you never seen, the Seven Wonders of the World
And I can make you the eighth if you wanna be my girl
When I say my girl I don't mean my woman, that ain't my style Need a real street stalker (stalker) to walk a green mile
We piling up the paper on the dining room table
Cause you able to realize I'm the truth and not a fable
We rock the freshest Sable, keep that 'chilla on the rack
What I look like with some thousand dollar shit up on my back?
I'm a million dollar mack that need a billion dollar bitch
Put my pimpin' in your life, watch ya daddy get rich
Easy as A-B-C, simple as 1-2-3
Get down with U-G-K, Pimp C, B-U-N B
Cause what's a ho with no pimp, and what's a pimp with no hoes
Don't be a lame, you know the game and how it goes
We tryna get chose

[Verse 4: Mugz]
Now I can say that I've never felt this way
But pimp would probably  tell me that ain't the players way
I could let my homies sway the feelings that I have for you
Thunderstorms of what they think could probably cloud my view
Don't get twisted I'm interested in where this could go
But it'd be a shame if my name slain for messing with a ho
And then homies laughed saying they know, smh
What if being a player forever is my fate
I enjoy the food you bring but I got enough on my plate, baby
You tell me, if you let this go then you crazy
Why would you ever listen to another person
I could fix that pain that you feel but if you leave it'll worsen
But here comes the other version from my brother
Do you think she'll stay faithful never fuck with another
Yeah she celibate when it comes to them dudes
This feels like a test what answer do I  choose
Do I follow my heart or follow my gut
My sister told me dont do it cause trust is a must
And distrust is a musk, it stinks and it's noticeable
Deodorant won't help, but you gotta decide for yourself
