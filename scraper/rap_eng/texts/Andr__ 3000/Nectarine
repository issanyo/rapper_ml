ANDRE: Hold your jewelry
CHEROKEE: Blahhh
ANDRE: Hold your jewelry or you might get some dangles

CHEROKEE: Yo, Dre
ANDRE: Yes?
CHEROKEE: Yo, what’s the difference between a nectarine and a peach?
ANDRE: Uh, well Miss Cherry, ummm, it was kinda like, um, the fuzz
CHEROKEE: The fuzz? Whatchu mean the fuzz?

[Verse 1:]
Today, I’m irritated
Kinda feels like cracker crumbs in your bed
This fuckboi tried to do me
Tried to do me
Got me mixed up with Fred
Who is Freddy?
Freddy Froot Loops!
Many talk about it, but I be it
So it’s me ‘til I’m gone, oh yeah
It’s just your down-for-whatever
Next door neighbor
Trying to make my way home
Yeah, can you understand
Well I know you can

[Chorus:]
As sure as a nectarine
Ain’t nothing but a bald-headed peach
I’ve got a song for each
And every one of you
As sure as a nectarine
Ain’t nothing but a bald-headed peach
I’ve got a song for each
And every one of you

[Verse 2:]
Nicks and dimes
(Ay, shawty, I got that purple, I got that green, whatever you need)
Surround my world
(Ay shawty, ay shawty, ay shawty, lemme holler at you real quick, shawty)
Everybody’s after [?] look so girl
(Shawty lemme buy you a drank or somethin'. What's yo sign, Shawty? What's yo sign? Can I come over yo crib or somethin'?)
(Little girl)

[Chorus]

[Bridge:]
Bullshit will fly
While soul and funk only die
I got this ache in my dome
To let you share what I own
Miss Glee and set for the school [?]
Bad ass little black girl break rules
Look at them eagles so high
My wings above my back side

[Chorus] (3x)
