I'm like a Glock, nigga, I always got a hot sixteen, knamean?

[Verse 1: Andre 3000]
I was a young lad of seventeen
My life had yet to show its ugly face
Only a pretty façade, hey God, it's me
Remember three, thousand
The one who used to pray to be a rapper
My child's in the third grade
His favorite rapper wasn't rapping 'til he heard me
I wasn't rapping till I heard something called Eric B
And Rakim's Paid in Full
Rap is really getting paid in full
So full that the kids don't go to school
In hopes of becoming one of us
The only requirement is you bust
Now college is looking slim, product is hooking them
Before their brains fully develop, they get enveloped by the  vision tele
The television tells them their vision
Now it's hard for them to make decisions without feeling
Uncool, unschooled, thumb rule
Rule of thumb, you can't be dumb
I wish I would've studied abroad
Well I studied a broad and she studied me back
And my course was hard
That was that, this is this, listen up
'Cause all I'm saying is
If thirty's the new twenty, thirty's the new twenty for them wheels as well
They looking for that mic or some pills to sell
While the girls are steady graduatin'
Nigga's standin' on the corner hatin', debatin'
'Well, should I get the new J's or the Kobe's?'
And they rollin' so they wide awake for four days
Huh, I'm a G-entleman, let's get reacquainted
I am Andre Benjamin

[Hook: Jay-Z]
I used to let my pants sag, not givin’ a fuck
Baby boy, now I’m all grown up
I used to cruise the used car lot, put chrome on the truck
Baby boy, now I’m all grown up
I used to play the block like that
I used to carry knots like that
Now I got black cards, good credit and such
Baby boy, 'cause I’m all grown up, ha

[Verse 2: Jay-Z]
Y'all roll blunts, I smoke Cubans all day
Y'all young’uns chase, I’m Patron'n it straight
I like South Beach but I’m in St. Tropez
Y'all drink Dom, but not Rose’
Hey, ya chick shop at the mall
My chick burning down Bergdorf’s
Comin' back with Birkin bags
Your chick is like, 'What type of purse is that?'
I’m from the era where niggas don’t snitch
You from the era where snitchin' is the shit
I’m afraid of the future
Y'all respect the one who got shot, I respect the shooter
Y'all go to parties to ice grill
I go to parties to party with nice girls
Young boys gotta chill, thirty’s the new twenty, nigga, I’m so hot still

[Hook]
I used to let my pants sag, not givin’ a fuck
Baby boy, now I’m all grown up
I used to cruise the used car lot, put chrome on the truck
Baby boy, now I’m all grown up
Yeah, we used to ball like that
Now we own the ball team, holla back
Now I got black cards, good credit and such
Baby boy, 'cause I’m all grown up, ha

[Verse 3: Ice Cube]
Jay-Z, what can a young motherfucka tell me
About the LAPD, about the air that we breathe
Nothin', nada, zero, zilch
I want tits for fun, you want tits for milk
I'm all leather and silk, your fuckin' T-shirt look like a quilt
Playground king, climb the monkey bars that I built
Thirty's the new twenty, Phantom's the new Bentley
Nigga, don't tempt me, I'll bury you up in Tempe (Westside)
And if I catch a ghost rider, tie him to a tree, gasoline like the lighter
Burn, you motherfuckin' biter
Treat you like George Bush treat Al-Qaeda
This is Guantanamo, think I'm a hoe
I made the honor roll, mixed with Geronimo (Yay, yay)
Before this mic we'll pass, learn how to wipe your nose before you wipe your ass
West Coast

Yeah, puttin' it down, nigga
You know, ha
Ice Cube, the pyroclastic flow
Ha, it never slow down, nigga

I used to let my pants sag, not givin’ a fuck
Baby boy, now I’m all grown up
I used to cruise the used car lot, put chrome on the truck
Baby boy, now I’m all grown up
I used to play the block like that
I used to carry knots like that
Now I got black cards, good credit and such
Baby boy, 'cause I’m all grown up, ha
