[Hook: André 3000]
Even the sun goes down, heroes eventually die
Horoscopes often lie, and sometimes 'y'
Nothin' is for sure, nothin' is for certain, nothin' lasts forever
But until they close the curtain (y'all know), it's him and I: Aquemini

[Verse 1: Big Boi]
Now is the time to get on, like Spike Lee said, "Get on the Bus"
Go get your work and keep your beeper chirpin', it's a must
Is you on that dust or cornstarch? Familiar with that smack, man?
The music is like that green stuff provided to you by sack man
Pacman, how in the fuck do you think we gon' do that, man?
Ridin' round Old National on 18's without no gat, man
I'm strapped, man, and ready to bust on any nigga like that, man
Me and my nigga we roll together like Batman and Robin
We prayed together through hard times and swung hard when it was fitting
But now we tappin' the brakes from all them corners that we be bending
In Volkswagens and Bonnevilles, Chevrolets and Coupe de Villes
If you ain't got no rims, nigga, don't get no wood grain steering wheel
For real, you can go on chill out and still build, let your paper stack
Instead of going into overkill, pay your fuckin' beeper bill, bitch

[Chorus: André 3000]
Even the sun goes down, heroes eventually die
Horoscopes often lie, and sometimes "y"
Nothin' is for sure, nothin' is for certain, nothin' lasts forever
But until they close the curtain, it's him and I: Aquemini

[Verse 2: André 3000]
Twice upon a time, there was a boy who died
And lived happily ever after, but that's another chapter
Live from home of the brave with dirty dollars
And beauty parlors and baby ballers and bowling ball Impalas
And street scholars, majoring in culinary arts
You know, how to work bread, cheese, and dough
From scratch, but see the catch is you can get caught
Know what ya selling, what you bought, so cut that big talk
Let's walk to the bridge, meet me halfway
Now you may see some children dead off in the pathway
It's them poor babies walkin' slowly to the candy lady
It's lookin' bad, need some hope, like the words 'maybe', 'if', or 'probably'
More than a hobby, when my turntables get wobbly, they don't fall
I'm sorry y'all, I often drift, I'm talking gift
So when it comes you never look the horse inside its grill
Of course you know I feel like the bearer of bad news
Don't want to be it but it's needed, so what have you?
Now question: is every nigga with dreads for the cause?
Is every nigga with golds for the fall? Naw
So don't get caught up in appearance
It's OutKast's Aquemini, another black experience

[Chorus: André 3000]
Even the sun goes down, heroes eventually die
Horoscopes often lie, and sometimes 'y'
Nothin' is for sure, nothin' is for certain, nothin' lasts forever
But until they close the curtain, it's him and I: Aquemini

[Verse 3: Big Boi]
The name is Big Boi, Daddy Fat Sax, the nigga that like them Cadillacs
I stay down with these streets 'cause these streets is where my folks at
Better know dat, some say we pro-black, but we professional
We missed a lot of church so the music is our confessional
Get off the testicles and the nutsacks
You bust rhyme, we bust back
Get-get back for real niggas that's out here tryin' to spit facts
You hear dat? You can't come near dat, maybe you need to quit
Because Aquemini is Aquarius and  Gemini runnin' shit like this

[Verse 4: André 3000]
My mind warps and bends, floats the wind, count to ten
Meet the twin—André Ben, welcome to the lion's den
Original skin, many men comprehend
I extend myself so you go out and tell a friend
Sin all depends on what you believing in
Faith is what you make it—that's the hardest shit since MC Ren
Alien can blend right on in with your kin
Look again, 'cause I swear I spot one every now and then
It's happening again, wish I could tell you when
André, this is André, y'all are just gon' have to make amends

[Chorus: André 3000]
Even the sun goes down, heroes eventually die
Horoscopes often lie, and sometimes "y"
Nothin' is for sure, nothin' is for certain, nothin' lasts forever
But until they close the curtain, it's him and I: Aquemini

[Skit: André 3000]
Master: Finally, Igor! We've done it, we've done it!
Igor: Yes, master! Yes, master!
Master: Igor, we've done it!
Both: Uh-oh
