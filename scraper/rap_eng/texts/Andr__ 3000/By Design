[Refrain: Kid Cudi]
Oooh, tap in to the frequency, light
Oooh, tap in to the frequency, light

[Verse 1: Kid Cudi]
Oh from dusk to dawn, I am truly alive
The satellite that sits in frame to illuminate this shaded place
He's a rose that don't belong, the music, the magic, take the lead
Come on with it, mmm, come on

[Pre-Hook: Kid Cudi]
Moments don't pass me up, no, no
'Cause I seize them in stride
Tell them winnin' never gave me in
When I eternally have faith
In the choices you made, it's all by design
Go with it, mmmm
Come on, don't fuck up the feng shui
Feng shui, feng shui, feng shui, feng shui

[Hook: André 3000]
I see everything with new beams, I do dream
My eyes are glowing mood rings, you're boring
Stop dueling with the true thing, I do think
When you think too much you're removing what's moving
Stuck inside a statue, look at you
Go ahead and pogo, something gon' catch you
A petty logo, shed all my tattoos
I read all the bad news that says I'm too careful

[Refrain: Kid Cudi]
Oooh, tap in to the frequency, light
Oooh, tap in to the frequency, light

[Verse 2: Kid Cudi]
The universe never steered me wrong
The universe never lied
Take me bound to the come me down
The fantasy in this remedy
Free from where you don't belong in the concept of time
New levels, mmm, come on

[Pre-Hook: Kid Cudi]
Moments don't pass me up, no, no
'Cause I seize them in stride
Tell them winnin' never gave me in
When I eternally have faith
In the choices you made, it's all by design
Go with it, mmmm
Come on, don't fuck up the feng shui

[Bridge: Kid Cudi]
So twisted in emotional notions, oh yeah
I savor your love, don't fuck up the feng shui

[Hook: André 3000]
I see every thing with new beams, I do dream
My eyes are glowing mood rings, you're boring
Stop dueling with the true thing, I do think
When you think too much you're removing what's moving
Stuck inside a statue, look at you
Go ahead and pogo, something gon' catch you
A petty logo, shed all my tattoos
I read all the bad news that says I'm too careful

[Refrain: Kid Cudi]
Oooh, tap in to the frequency, light
Oooh, tap in to the frequency, light

[Verse 3: Kid Cudi & André 3000]
Feel like I'm being tested every minute
Feel like yesterday I was blind, I've been lost
Seems like I've stumbled on a path, no coincidence
Truly in my essence, I've arrived
Who am I? Who am I? Don't remind me
Too alive, too alive, new arriving
You were right, I was left in it before
To the light, to the light, I am Carol Anne
Parallel to paradise
I reach out for my lifeline
The angels laugh in paradise
They say I am my own lifeline, look in you
To the night, to the night I'm abandoned
To deny, to deny, what a sandpit
Couldn't I, couldn't I have an angel?
To the light, to the light, I am Carol Anne

[Bridge: Kid Cudi]
So twisted in emotional notions, oh yeah
I savor your love, don't fuck up the feng shui

[Hook: André 3000]
