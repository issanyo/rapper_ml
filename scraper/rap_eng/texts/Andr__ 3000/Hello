[Chorus: Erykah Badu]
Hello, hello, hey, hello, hello
Hello, hello, hey, hello, hello
Hello, hello, hey, hello, hello
Hello, hello, hey, hello, hello
Hello, hello, hey, hello, hello
Hello, hello, hey, hello, hello
Hello, hello, hey, hello, hello

[Verse 1: André 3000]
Okay, challenge
Leave your phone unlocked and right side up
Walk out the room without throwin' your bitch off balance
It's either on or off, ain't no in between when it's valid
I seem to wanna talk more and more 'bout what really matters
I've seen my aura hop out my torso and hit her backwards
Flip, watchin' you skip down my corridor, fuck a ballad
Don't need shit on the side no more, all entreé, fuck a salad
I often have awesome thoughts of tossin' this softer palate
So when we fall any wall, any stall, any crawl, any pause
Any scar, any tar, any dark will dissolve, kill them all
Build-A-Bear, build them all, build it where it won't fall
Give it all, give it my all, yeah
Don't wear any drawers, any bra, anymore, in it raw, isn't it raw?
I'm in awe, I'm involved, common law, cummin' on stomach wall
Kermit frog jump off London fog
Bridges in the midst of callgirls my woman calls
Unicorn, you my porn

[Bridge: André 3000]
I don't know
I don't know
I don't know, I don't know, I don't know
I don't know
Will this bitch click over for me?
I mean will this woman click over for me?
Over for me? Over for me?
Is it over for me? Over for me? Over for me?
I don't know
I don't know
I don't know, I don't know, I don't know
I don't know
Is this bitch gettin' over on me?
If I go there will she go there with me?
Should I, I not be so open, I mean?
Open, I mean? You know what I mean?
Know what I mean?
I don't know
I don't know I don't know, I don't know, I don't know
I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know (I don't know)
Will this bitch click over for me?
I mean will this woman click over for me?
Over for me? Over for me?
Is it over for me? Over for me? Over for me?
I don't know
I don't know, I don't know
I don't know, I don't know, I don't know
I don't know
Is this bitch gettin' over on me?
If I go there will she go there with me?
Should I, I not be so open, I mean?
Open, I mean? You know what I mean?
Know what I mean?

[Chorus: Erykah Badu]
Hello, hello, hey, hello, hello
Hello, hello, hey, hello, hello
Hello, hello, hey, hello, hello
Hello, hello, hey, hello, hello
Hello, hello, hey, hello, hello
Hello, hello, hey, hello, hello
Hello, hello, hey, hello, hello

[Verse 2: Erykah Badu]
Hello, it's me, it's me, baby
I thought about us for a long, long time
Maybe I think too much but something's wrong
Something that said it doesn't last too long, too long
Maybe I shouldn't think of you as mine, mine, mine, mine, mine
But I can't help it, baby

[Verse 3: André 3000]
See you, see you
I see it that you want, as much as I do you
I take for granted, that you're always there
I take for granted, that you just don't care
And sometimes
It's just too hard to see it through, babe
And that's why

[Outro: Erykah Badu & André 3000]
It's important to me
That you know you are free
Cause I never want to make you change
For me, babe
Don't change, don't change, squirrel
For me, babe
Don't change, don't change, squirrel
For me, babe
Don't change, don't change, squirrel
For me, babe
Don't change, don't change, squirrel
For me, babe
Don't change, don't change, squirrel
For me, babe
Don't change, don't change, squirrel
For me, babe
Don't change, don't change, squirrel
For me, babe
Don't change, don't change, squirrel
For me, babe
Don't change, don't change, squirrel
For me, babe
Don't change, don't change, squirrel
For me, babe
Don't change, don't change, squirrel
For me, babe
Don't change, don't change, squirrel
For me, babe
Don't change, don't change, squirrel
For me, babe
Don't change, don't change, squirrel
For me, babe
