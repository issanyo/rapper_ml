[Intro]
Cousins, come casually witness the chaos backstage
Where dreams are fulfilled over cheap thrills
Damn, (Hey baby) my sack spills

[Hook: Gwen Stefani]
Hey baby, hey baby, hey
Hey baby, hey baby, hey
Hey baby baby

[Verse 1: Gwen Stefani]
I'm the kind of girl that hangs with the guys
Like a fly on the wall with my secret eyes
Taking it in, try to be feminine
With my makeup bag watching all the sin
Misfit, I sit
Lit up, wicked
Everybody else surrounded by the girls
With the tank tops and the flirty words (Hey baby)

I'm just sipping on chamomile
Watching boys and girls and their sex appeal
With a stranger in my face who says he knows my mom
And went to my high school

[Hook: Gwen Stefani]
All the boys say
Hey baby, hey baby, hey
Girls say, girls say
Hey baby, hey baby, hey
Hey baby baby (Hey baby)
Hey baby, hey baby, hey
Boys say, boys say
Hey baby, hey baby, hey

[Post-Hook: André 3000]
Girls get all the flowers
Guys have all the fun
But she won’t bite if you won’t bite
Tonight’s the lucky one
Love found in the lobby
Room service for two
Breakfast in your underoos
Right next to you know who

[Verse 2: Gwen Stefani]
I'm the one they feed upon
Give a bit, a star is born
And if you're hot enough you'll get the pass
So you can tell your friends how you made it back

No matter what they say I'm still the same
Somehow everybody knows my name
And all the girls wanna get with the boys
And the boys really like it

[Hook: Gwen Stefani]
All the boys say
Hey baby, hey baby, hey
Girls say, girls say
Hey baby, hey baby, hey
Hey baby baby (Hey baby)
Hey baby, hey baby, hey
Boys say, boys say
Hey baby, hey baby, hey

[Verse 3: Big Boi]
They call me Mister Freeze
Cut back to the dressing room with ease
No pushing, no shoving
Cool, calm, and collective like a G
I know I’m supposed to rock the roses and bowtie
Nobody’s up on Gwen, so I’m the one that’s gonna approach her
Smoker, smelling like li’l mota when I stroll by
The boys in the band having all the fun
And the girl, she doesn’t know how
That’s what I heard (Ooh)
Uh, that sounds absurd (Ooh)
But when you’re dealing with a pimp player type motherfucker from the Dirty
Uh, things can only get crunker than they was
No Doubt, OutKast, Aquemini Records, Earthtone on the drum

[Hook: Gwen Stefani]
All the boys say
Hey baby, hey baby, hey
Girls say, girls say
Hey baby, hey baby, hey
Hey baby baby (Hey baby)
Hey baby, hey baby, hey
Boys say, boys say
Hey baby, hey baby, hey

[Post-Hook: André 3000]
Girls get all the flowers (Oh my God)
Guys have all the fun (I can’t believe this)
But she won’t bite if you won’t bite
(What’s going on?) (I just love you)
Tonight’s the lucky one
(I know all your songs)
Love found in the lobby
(I’m talking about every lyric, every word)
Room service for two
Breakfast in your underoos
(You know what? I’m your number one fan)
Right next to you know who

[Interlude]
Walking through the backstage pearl
Walking through a darker world
Pierced gipples and smoke
Sometimes she chokes
On the double standard joke

[Verse 4: Killer Mike]
Backstage creepin’, I’m bent like elbows
Looking for that hidden throwback like shelltoes
Smell that blitty burned in backrooms
Girls with the tiggo bitties in bathrooms
She likes boys in the band, No Doubt
‘I’m Just a Girl’ spittin’ out her mouth
Tragic Kingdom, where she come from
She just wanna hear that song by Gwendolyn
Prepare to Rock Steady, remix is ready
OutKast, Killer Mike, No Doubt drop heavy
