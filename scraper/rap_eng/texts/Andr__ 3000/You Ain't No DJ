[Intro: Big Boi]
Boy, stop!
You ain't no DJ

[Verse 1: Big Boi]
I double dare, matter of fact, nigga, I double dog dare
Any rapper to take it there with this player here
Let's be clear, I'm a leader, not your peer
Valedictorian of this rap shit every year (year, year, year)
Like beer and pretzels with the game, I go good
I'm the Hansel to your Gretel, you's a dame, understood?
Overstand, ho ass nigga from my hood, I'm embarrassed
By the lack of class, sat in the back of class
But passed with flying colors with yo' backwards ass
You're like the caboose and I'm the engine locomotive
To let loose steam in the booth, scream, awooo!
Dream Team, nigga, fuck that pillow talk, keep sleeping
While I'm beating down yo' street up in that green thing
Greetings, Earthlings, I've been lurking deep in the shadows
Gathering artillery for the battle
Now, on the front line, I stand, microphone in my right hand
Left foot on the gas, don't make me put my foot in yo' ass

[Hook: Big Boi]
Yo DJ ain't no DJ, he just make them fucking mixtapes
Where they at? Where they at? Where they at? Where they at?
Where they at? Where they at? Where they at?
Yo DJ ain't no DJ, he just hit that instant replay
There they go, there they go, there they go, there they go
There they go, there they go, there they go
Yo DJ ain't no DJ, he just make them fucking mixtapes
Where they at? Where they at? Where they at? Where they at?
Where they at? Where they at? Where they at?
Yo DJ ain't no DJ, he just hit that instant replay
There they go, there they go, there they go, there they go
There they go, there they go, there they go

[Verse 2: Yelawolf]
My momma gave birth to a 10-pound, 6-ounce dream
And God said look for the burning bush, now I turned to weed
So I jumped in my shell when I saw my momma burning trees
Hard white, I trickle nickel bags
Ice cold true shit, in the booth with blue lips
On your grave like a tulip, in the bar like a pool stick
808 Toomp shit, Magic Mike, poof, bitch
Ain't nowhere to rest, nowhere for you to sit
I stole your couch and I took your truck to move it with
Sofa any one of you wanna get to' up
I'mma tattoo, Kodak you, close up
Ain't no UFO, no, Yela's a supernova
Dogs are barking as soon as that trooper roll up
30 aught 6, Momma, don't gotta load up
'Cause I'm from The Varsity, it may be hard to get RC Cola, hold up

[Hook: Big Boi]
Yo DJ ain't no DJ, he just make them fucking mixtapes
Where they at? Where they at? Where they at? Where they at?
Where they at? Where they at? Where they at?
Yo DJ ain't no DJ, he just hit that instant replay
There they go, there they go, there they go, there they go
There they go, there they go, there they go
Yo DJ ain't no DJ, he just make them fucking mixtapes
Where they at? Where they at? Where they at? Where they at?
Where they at? Where they at? Where they at?
Yo DJ ain't no DJ, he just hit that instant replay
There they go, there they go, there they go, there they go
There they go, there they go, there they go

[Verse 3: Yelawolf]
Yeah and I party in poverty with people like
"Yeah, you're famous, so what?
I bet you can't hitch that semi up to this tow truck"
Rich with a hundred dollars, soul like a batch of collards
Yeah, I'm pale but I'll impale you with an Impala
Roll with pimp scholars, ATLiens
A-L-A-B-A-M-A agains, come and check my weight again
Baby, I know I ain't that crazy, the scale says heavy
Must be my dick the way bitches been hanging on it lately

[Verse 4: Big Boi]
Yeah, we stay banging on the daily, soul funk crusader maybe
Tailored alligator soufflé, escalade all in yo' ladies
Space invader, I'm the lyrical Darth Vader
Give thanks, pussy nigga, I don't expose you as a hater
Got Decatur, East Point, College Park and the SWATs
Campbellton Road closed, road block, watch out for the cops
Gotta think outside the box, know how to connect the dots
'Fore somebody hit the jackpot playing in your slot, boy, stop

[Hook: Big Boi]
Yo DJ ain't no DJ, he just make them fucking mixtapes
Where they at? Where they at? Where they at? Where they at?
Where they at? Where they at? Where they at?
Yo DJ ain't no DJ, he just hit that instant replay
There they go, there they go, there they go, there they go
There they go, there they go, there they go
Yo DJ ain't no DJ, he just make them fucking mixtapes
Where they at? Where they at? Where they at? Where they at?
Where they at? Where they at? Where they at?
Yo DJ ain't no DJ, he just hit that instant replay
There they go, there they go, there they go, there they go
There they go, there they go, there they go
