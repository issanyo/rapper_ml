Whoo! (Whoo!)
Turn me up! Don't turn me down!
Cut me up! Don't let me down!

Find, find a way!

Find a way to get out, without a hit out! You dig in! You dig out! You get out! GhettoMusick! GhettoMusick!
Find a way to get in, to fit in! You get on, you get out! Without a doubt!
GhettoMusick! GhettoMusick!

Climbing out of this hole! (Climbing out of this hole)
With a frown on my face! (In the place to be)
In the place to be and not to be at the same time!

G-H-E-T-T-O M-U-S-I-C-K stay down!
O-U-T-K-A-S-T best know that we don't play 'round
If it don't stank like they stank
Then they can't swallow that down
Your battleship is sunk, I wish grandma could see us!

Find a way to get out, without a hit out! You dig in! You dig out! You get out! GhettoMusick! GhettoMusick!
Find a way to get in, to fit in! You get on, you get out! Without a doubt!
GhettoMusick! GhettoMusick!

I just want you to know, how I feel! (Feeling good, feeling great!)
How I feel! (Feeling great, feeling good! How are you?)
I just want you to know, how I feel! (Feeling good, feeling great!)
How I feel! (Feeling great, feeling good! How are you?)

Hot tub! Back to the bony, I'm Tony!
Ask my grandma, Edna Mae Kearse, she showed me
How to be the smooth operator, dominator
In the state of Georgia
Hip Hop! Stand destroy ya!
Leave a muthafucka open like a foyer
He from the Dirty now here come the paranoia
A lawyer couldn't object or disrespect the technique
Sweat me, wipe off the sweat!
Fight off the shit and flush the waste down
The pipes of my life flow deep into the ground
Find my purpose on the surface of this earth is
Plane is standard to me they have no purpose
Campaign in vein for the same lame fame you obtain
You ought to be detained by the Hip Hop Sheriff
Locked up, no possibility of getting out
Because the shit you make is killing me
And my ears and my peers
I hear the end is near, no fear we disappear
Then reappear again in a fresh new light
I hope it's peaceful and cloudy because if not we gonna fight like...

G-H-E-T-T-O M-U-S-I-C-K stay down!
O-U-T-K-A-S-T best know that we don't play 'round
If it don't stank like they stank
Then they can't swallow that down
Your battleship is sunk, I wish grandma could see us!

Find a way to get out, without a hit out! You dig in! You dig out! You get out! GhettoMusick! GhettoMusick!
Find a way to get in, to fit in! You get on, you get out! Without a doubt!
GhettoMusick! GhettoMusick!
