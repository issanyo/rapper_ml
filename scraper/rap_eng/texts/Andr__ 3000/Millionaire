[Intro: André 3000]
I said, her from the city
So her got to be witty, witty
She said, him from the country
So him got to be funky, funky

[Verse 1: André 3000]
Mama I'm a millionaire, but I feel like a bum
Mama I'm a millionaire, but I feel like the only one
I, I, I, I woke up early this morning
I don't think y'all heard me
I woke up early this morning
I don't think y'all heard me
I woke up early this morning
I don't think, think y'all heard me
I woke up early this morning, but I still ain't see the sun

[Hook: Andre 3000]
Oh oh, oh oh, oh oh
Oh oh, oh oh, oh oh
Oh oh, oh oh, oh oh
Oh oh, oh oh, oh oh

[Verse 2: Kelis & André 3000]
Papa I'm a millionaire, but Saks Fifth Ave. don't sell affection
Saks Fifth Ave. don't sell affection
Papa I'm a millionaire, but I ain't moving in the right direction
Something ain't right, I know
I ain't rich, til he is rich, and she is rich, then we is rich
I ain't rich, til he is rich, and she is rich, then we is rich
I ain't rich, til he is rich, and she is rich, then we is rich
I ain't rich, til he is rich, and she is rich, then we is rich, mmmm

[Verse 3: André 3000]
Where there is cheese there are rats
Where ever there are rats there are cats
Where ever there are cats there are dogs
If you got the dogs, you got bitches
Bitches always out to put their paws on your riches
If you got riches, you got glitches
If you got glitches in your life computer, turn it off
And then reboot it, now you back on
Can't just put the cap on the old bottle
Once you pop it, that will spoil it
Go on and drink it and enjoy it, uh
Mama I'm a millionaire

[Bridge: Kelis]
What's a girl to do when she just has dimes
No time, just pay-ay-ay-ay
What's a girl to do instead of me
It's you, be true-ue-ue-ue
What's a girl to do in a world of greed
But kneel and pray-ay-ay-ay
What's a girl to do when she's lost her long time friends
That's li-i-i-i-ife

[Outro: Slick Rick]
I, I'm feeling sad like a million bucks
I, I, I, I, I, I'm feeling sad like a million
I, I, I'm feeling sad like a million
Sad like a million
I, I, I, I, I, I'm feeling sad
