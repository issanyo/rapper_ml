[Intro: André 3000]
My name is Cupid Valentino, the modern day Cupid
And I just want to say one thing

[Verse 1: André 3000]
Happy Valentine's Day (Every day the 14th)
I don't think y'all heard me
I just wanna say Happy Valentine's Day (Every day the 14th)
Can y'all dig that?
Now when arrows don't penetrate, see (Cupid grabs the pistol)
Uh, yeah, now, now lookie here
He shoots straight for your heart, now, and he won't miss you
But that's alright, y'all won't believe in me anyway, but

[Chorus: Joi and Screechy Peach & André 3000]
Ya won't believe in me
But you would fancy leprechauns or groundhogs
No, thank you, Easter Bunny
There's all this talk about Santa Claus, but see
Love will rule supreme

[Verse 2: André 3000]
Happy Valentine's Day (Every day the 14th)
You got it, when Cupid knocks at your door (You can't ignore me)
There's no need to run
So, Happy Valentine's Day, hey (Every day the 14th)
Now I may have it all wrong, see
If you know what loves mean, well
Well, somebody tell me
'Cause they just don't believe in me

[Chorus: Joi and Screechy Peach & André 3000]
Ya won't believe in me
But you would fancy leprechauns or groundhogs
No, thank you, Easter Bunny
There's so much fuss about Santa Claus, but see
Cupid will not be defeated

[Verse 3: André 3000]
Happy Valentine's Day, every day the 14th
Now, I know your hearts have grown cold
And that bothers me
Now, I understand, 'cause I used to be a bad boy in my day
I know you tryin' to protect your lil' feelings
But you can't run away
Ho-oh

[Chorus: Joi and Screechy Peach & André 3000]
Ya won't believe in me
But you would fancy
Hey, don't you supposed to be
Some kind of player, or something?
Bunny

[Post-Chorus: André 3000]
Well, keep on running, player
'Cause I got my good shoes on
And I got 'em tied up tight
So you gon' find out tonight

[Verse 4: André 3000]
Got a sweet lil' darlin' back in my corner
Below, I know I love her, but act like I don't want her
Surrounded by the lovely, but yet, feel like a loner
Could be an organ donor the way I give up my heart
But never know because, shit, I never tell her
Ask me how I'm feeling, I'd holla that it's irrele–
I don't get myself caught up in the Jello jella
And pudding pops, that others opt to call falling in love
But for the record, have you ever rode a horse?
Like for you to send me to Pluto, I said, "Of course!"
But if you ain't a sweety, indeedy, I won't endorse
Han Solo 'til I'm hit by the bullet, so may the force
Be with you and I'll hit you when better time permits
For now, show me samples, examples why you're the shit
But how am I to know with the profession that I'm in?
And if you do not know me then how could you be my friend?

[Outro: Joi and Screechy Peach & André 3000]
Happy Valentine's, Happy Valentine's
Happy Valentine's Day (Happy Valentine's Day)
Happy Valentine's, Happy Valentine's
Happy Valentine's Day (Happy Valentine's Day)
Happy Valentine's, Happy Valentine's
Happy Valentine's Day (Happy Valentine's Day)
Happy Valentine's, fuck that Valentine's
Fuck that Valentine's Day (Fuck that Valentine's Day)
Fuck that Valentine's, fuck that Valentine's
Fuck that Valentine's Day (Fuck that Valentine's Day)
Fuck that Valentine's, fuck that Valentine's
Fuck that Valentine's Day (Fuck that Valentine's Day)
Fuck that Valentine's, fuck that Valentine's
Fuck that Valentine's Day (Fuck that Valentine's Day)
Fuck that Valentine's, fuck that Valentine's
Fuck that Valentine's Day
