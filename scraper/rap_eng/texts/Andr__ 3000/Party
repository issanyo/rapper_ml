[Intro: Kanye West]
You a bad girl, and your friend's bad too (Ooh)
We got the swag sauce, she dripping swagu
You a bad girl and your friends bad too (Ooh)
You got the swag sauce, she dripping swagu (Ooh)

[Verse 1: Beyoncé]
I may be young, but I'm ready
To give you all my love
I told my girls you can get it
Don't slow it down, just let it go

[Pre-Chorus 1: Beyoncé]
So in love, I'll give it all away
Just don't tell nobody tomorrow
So tonight, I'll do it every way
Speakers knocking 'til the morning light

[Chorus: Beyonce, Andre 3000 & Consequence]
'Cause we like to party, hey!
Hey! hey! hey! hey! hey!
'Cause we like to party, hey!
Hey! hey! hey! hey! hey!
'Cause we like to party!

[Verse 2: Beyoncé]
Your touch is driving me crazy
I can't explain the way I feel
Top down, with the radio on and the night belongs to us
Just hold me close, don't let me go

[Pre-Chorus 2: Beyoncé]
So in love, I don't care what they say
I don't care if they're talking tomorrow
'Cause tonight's the night, oh-oh-oh-oh
That I give you everything
Music knocking 'til the morning light
'Cause we like to party!

[Verse 3: Andre 3000]
Set the scene, 3000 degrees
I ain't worried about them, fuck niggas over there, but they worry about me
I got a homeboy named Butter and another homeboy there, nigga named Cheese
Fuck with me, baby, I’ll make it milk till it drip down your knees
Spit this shit for reallo, Brain Brillo
Kiddo say he looks up to me, this just makes me feel old
Never thought that we could become someone else's hero
Man, we were just in the food court eating our gyros
Yesterday, that's the way, every single morning I try to pray
Grandmom and them they never forgot and nothing else really mean nothing to me
I ain't studying the beat
You talking to me? Girl, why you fucking with me?
Move on there ain't nothing to see
Pshh, always something to saw
I'm the raw, off the rip, cause of him
All of them, will remem-ber the min-
Nute they fell in love with rap black, like having your cousin back
Blue like when that rent is due, cream like when I'm loving you, yeah

[Pre-Chorus 2: Beyoncé]
So in love, I'll give it all away
Just don't tell nobody tomorrow
'Cause tonight's the night, oh-oh-oh-oh
That I give you everything
Music knocking 'til the morning light

[Chorus: Beyonce, Andre 3000 & Consequence]
'Cause we like to party, hey!
Hey! hey! hey! hey! hey!
'Cause we like to party, hey!
Hey! hey! hey! hey! hey!
'Cause we like to party!

[Outro: Kanye West]
You a bad girl, and your friend's bad too (Ooh)
We got the swag sauce, she dripping swagu
You a bad girl and your friends bad too (Ooh)
You got the swag sauce, she dripping swagu (Ooh)
