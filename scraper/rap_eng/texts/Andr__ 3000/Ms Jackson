I'm sorry Ms. Jackson
I am for real
Never meant to make your daughter cry
I apologize a trillion times

I'm sorry Ms. Jackson
I am for real
Never meant to make your daughter cry
I apologize a trillion times

I'm sorry Ms. Jackson
I am for real
Never meant to make your daughter cry
I apologize a trillion times

I'm sorry Ms. Jackson
I am for real
Never meant to make your daughter cry
I apologize a trillion times

Me and your daughter
Got a special thing going on
You say it's puppy love
We say it's full grown

Hope that we feel this
Feel this way forever
You can paint a pretty picnic
But you can't predict the weather
Can't predict the weather

I'm sorry Ms. Jackson
I am for real
Never meant to make your daughter cry
I apologize a trillion times

I'm sorry Ms. Jackson
I am for real
Never meant to make your daughter cry
I apologize a trillion times

Me and your daughter
Got a special thing going on
You say it's puppy love
We say it's full grown

Hope that we feel this
Feel this way forever
You can paint a pretty picnic
But you can't predict the weather
Can't predict the weather

I'm sorry Ms. Jackson
