[Intro: Sample]
Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye
Can't ne-, can't ne-, can't ne-, can't ne-
Can't nev-, can't nev-, can't nev-, can't nev-
Can't never, can't never, can't never, can't never

[Verse 1: James Blake]
We delay the show, we kiss so long
We breathe through the nose 'til the breath is gone
And everything slows, everything's rose now
You use both hands, I use both hands
We meet in the middle, we meet in the sand
And everything's ghost, everything's ghost now
Every, everything's rose now

[Chorus: James Blake]
(Alright now) Where's the catch?
(Can't fool me) Where's the catch?
There must be, there must be a catch

[Interlude: André 3000]
Hey, alright, now this may be a little bit heady
And, y'know, I hate heady-ass verses
I wrote this shit, so here we go
Yo

[Verse 2: André 3000]
All my pets are mystic, keeps me in a cage (Cage)
Aww, my head is twisted, keeps me spinnin' 'round for days (Days)
Exorcism, pessimism has arisen
There's no reason really, treason to myself so silly
So perfect, so perfect, so why do I look for curtains?
Uncertain but certainly false alarm's alertin'
A burden in beautiful times, a garden snake (Sss)
Won't bite me, but frightens me like I know I'm ate
I know I ain't, I know it, ayy
Harmony, harmony, how many, how many
Days of amazin' will it be before it phases?
And I say, "I told you so" (Told you so)
Summer bee, summer bee buzzin'
Some'll be hovering over nothin'
All of a sudden it's fall and it's over, though
Come with me, come with me, calming me down
Be chamomile, calamine lotion
Camel motion, humpin' on the flo' (Yeah)
Tumbleweed, tumbleweed
Wanna leave before the apparitions take over the city
We build and discover gold
Alchemists make it silver before you know it
Negative nickels until it's void
Aluminum foil it back to soil, oh yeah

[Chorus: James Blake]
Where's the catch?

[Bridge: James Blake & André 3000]
But everything's rose, everything's rose
Everything's rose now
(Isn't it brighter?)
But everything's rose (Everything)
Everything's rose (Everything)
Everything's rose now
(Everything-thing)
Everything's rose (Everything-thing)
Everything's rose (Everything-thing)
Everything's rose now
Can you trust me?
But-but, every-everything-thing's rose
(Everything is rose)
Every-everything-thing's rose
(Everything is)
But-but, every-everything-thing's rose
(Everything's is rose)
Every-everything-thing's rose
(Now)
Every-everything-thing's rose
But-but, every-everything-thing's rose
(Alright now)
Everything, everything
Everything, everything

[Chorus: James Blake]
(Alright now) Where's the catch?
(Can't fool me) Where's the catch?
There must be, there must be a catch

[Outro]
(Alright now)
