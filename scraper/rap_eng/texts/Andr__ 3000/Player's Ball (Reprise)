[Intro: Peaches]
Here's a little something for the players out there hustling
Getting down for theirs
From East Point, College Park, Decatur, Da 'Briar
You know, niggas worldwide...

[Rico Wade]
Man, the scene was so thick
Lowriders, '77 Sevilles, El Dogs, nothing but them 'Lacs
All the players, all the hustlers
I'm talking about a black man heaven here
YouknowhatI'msayin? Yeah

[Sleepy Brown]
Cadillacs are coming, from everywhere (yeahhh)
Liquor vibing good ‘cause love is in the air
To all you players and you pimps, smoke out and have a ball
And if your hoe is actin crazy, put her on the wall
Now now now everybody's dancing and just feeling right
I see all of you players got your sauce laid in more ice
I hope when all of this is over, as I get old, yeah
My kids'll have a story, that still be told, woo, huh, about

[Hook: Sleepy Brown]
All the players came, from far and wide
Wearing afros and braids, kicking them gangsta rides
Now I'm here to tell ya, there's a better day
When the player’s ball is happening, all day e’ryday
