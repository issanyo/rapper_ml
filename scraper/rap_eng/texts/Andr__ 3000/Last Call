[Hook : Mello] (Lil' Jon & The East Side Boys)
Tell them niggas that be holdin' the wall: (FUCK Y'ALL!!)
Hit the flow start shakin' it all (YES Y'ALL)
What we drinking, no we drinking it all (EH)
We gon do it 'til we can't or we fall, Last call
Tell them mothafuckas holding the wall: (FUCK Y'ALL!!)
Hit the flow start shaking it all (YES Y'ALL)
What we drinking, no we drinking it all (EH)
We gon do it 'til we can't or we fall, Last call

[Verse 1 : Mello]
Now look here
I'm gon' hit da club man, I'm gon' get some love
I'm the coolest nigga ain't gon' spend more than a dub
I'm gon' tell that broad and her chicken head friend
No Ferrari, no Jag, no Bentley, or a Benz
Might just play the wall with this mean look on my grill
Act like I'm da hater, the Haitian from Hateville
I remember her, act like she don't remember me
When I was Cadillac'n, Coupe Deville'in, and chickenhead drillin'

[Hook]

[Verse 2 : Big Boi]
I'm gon' get that fresh-fly fade and then I'm gon' get laid
Like some finger-waves on pay day, my lady, you gon' get paid
Making a early morning serenade for you to start your day
Or the sound of a starter pistol fired close to where you lay
Last call for alcohol, make a fast call for the hay
The dirty Dungeon [?] has informed me the drought has ended today
With no delay
And a, four piece grizzle we on our way
For a brief stay in a sweet place for a petite face to lay

[Hook]

[Verse 3 : Slimm Calhoun]
Them boys so wild, don't crack no smile
Closet like the Wild Kingdom: fox, minks, and crocodiles
Popped tops and what we drink, so sit back for a while
Matter a fact, light that, and I'll be right back
They want a couple more bottles I got something for 'em to swallow
Anybody ever told you you look like a model?
You know the story, she bit the hook, line, and follow
Got my hooks in the back and I'm a grind until tomorrow
They call me Mack Rapalicious, and when I bubble
I blow trouble up, in your ear
They call me Mack Rapalicicious, and when I bubble
It's, trouble all up in you dear!

[Hook]

[Verse 4 : Mello]
Yes, I know the way excite them hoes
Me cold reptilian feet, bite them hoes
Got a partner, oh his mind sick
He say he loved this ol' coke-strung-out stripper bitch
Why he so dumb?
I'm so pimp it's ridiculous
Got tinted windows on my ride I'm inconspicuous
Run with this pretty thang
She ain't yours you wish she was
We don't stop, it's so repeated and continuous
Mello Capone, Don Huggy Bear
Pokey the fuckin' pimpolous, ain't that cute slick em, out their draws I'm so infamous
Dead serious
From the club, to the Caddy, to the Holiday Inn
From the dusk til' the dawn we gon' do it again

[Hook]
