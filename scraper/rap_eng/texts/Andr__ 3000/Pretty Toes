City girls (go shorty, do your thing now)
Sexy girls (go shorty, do your thing now)
Pretty girls, ohh yeah

I need that one that'll make ya heart stop when you see her
She can get a pick of the 'Llac or the Modena
I'll give it all from two to fo'-seaters
It ain't gotta be Halloween, I'm +trickin+ just to +treat+ her
Jealousy in the urr - other girls wanna be her
She young right now, she's an up-and-comin diva
She ain't gotta measure up, but she gotta be off the meter
But if I can dance with Cindy, I can dance with Shaquita
Cause I know I can, I shall, I will
I feels I can, I felt
I plays with a whole lotta mil's
You ain't talkin 'bout nothin if you ain't talkin 'bout dollar bills (hey!)
Shorty glow shine, so fine, you gotta keep her (hey!)
Pretty toed, half Black, half senorita (hey!)
Coochie so good, make it hard for you to leave her
I'm a playa so even if I'm losin I never cheat her, uhh

[Hook w/ Nelly ad libs]

Hey, hey
T.I.P. be off the meter when he sharp as a needle
In a new two-seater, pissin on niggas ego
I don't wanna rap no mo', I'm CEO
No mo' menage-a-trois, the full trio
Three ho, get in they mind like Miss Cleo
You know, nigga try a hold like Judo (oh!)
I know a lot of nigga hot about me ('bout me)
I know you niggas ain't forgot about me
I'm a shotter{?} with the O's and the dro
And the blow and the, Jag-o and get the clothes out the sto'
Anyway - I got a bottle of Mo' and X-O
And I'm lookin for a modelin ho, so let's go
Get it right - six nights, six flights, six shows (six shows)
Six checks, each one, six oh's (six oh's)
Six broads to choose, they six pros
Light-skinned Asian bitches with pink toes (okay)

[Hook w/ Nelly ad libs]

Uhh, uhh
Now I done been around the world TWICE, back again
Whoever thought I'd be twenty times plat-inum
Whoever thought I'd have jewels but I lack a gem
I done dealt with plenty dimes, but I lack the ten
A New York chick, I met her through the fashion biz
And we be doin them type of thangs - you can't imagine shit
She be bitin and screamin cause she's so passionate
Shorty got blue eyes but she African [echoes]
Talkin 'bout

Yeah! We wanna thank all the ladies for comin out tonight
Every one that.. you know, open-toed, inch-heel stilleto

Or maybe you just runnin to the grocery sto' in your house shoes
With your feet out, girl you lookin good
