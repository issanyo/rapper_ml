[Verse:]

Nah I don't need no wifey
Moretime I lay low but these women they try to find me
Hit me with texts on my phone like "boy, I see you've changed, you went from everybody's fav to paving your own way"

I'm on my own ting, smoking dolja thinking bout my old ting
Should take a trip to Woolwich, might just see her round the way but I'm stubborn
Know that brudda took my place, I don't mind, I can't judge him

Cause lately I been going through it
Took a break from the music, I had to watch their movements
And still I don't feel competition, like, what they doing?

Cepheece told me I don't rap with any passion now
Yeah, I guess she feels I got complacent
Told her it's hard when you got nothing else to rap about
But these women & our lost communication

It's all crazy
Taking L's on a daily, convert that shit to wins
I'm Steph Curry with the flavours

Sending risky texts' got my iphone moving dangerous
Niggas wanna be me, man, they hopping on the wave quick
Gyaldem love the music, me and drizzy on their playlist
It's that summer '16, FTG, they're so impatient

She don't understand the wave but she like it
Could never link her in public we slide in private
But these women they think they know tings, trust me I always notice
Most these accusations fake, won't go unnoticed

Adidas sliders don't need no gucci
I need a baddie, real bad like Karrueche
We can swerve through the ends, girl you know that uber roomy
You can bring your bestfriend, 3's a crowd, we'll make a movie
And you still the main attraction
Link you in a tracky, girl you swear that shit's attractive
Like to dress up most days, girl you know my lifestyle flashy
And I swear I'm hella faded, smoking plenty of the ammi

Still thinking bout the worst days
But believe me I remember all our first days
Kept it to ourselves, use to see you every Wednesday
But girl you went and changed up on a nigga in the worst way
And I can't look at you the same
I use to say your name with pride, now I just say your name in vain
Look what you done now
Rolling with winners, I need to blow now
The scene needs change and I'm the one who got the dough now
Don't ever question the "know how"
I'm "Mr. make a banger", now they bang me on the low now
They hit me on the radio, "Maria" doing numbers
It's a shame the inspiration couldn't be the one to function
We can't work no more
Pressure all on my shoulders, they want that work some more I'm doing features these days
It's hard to find the right balance, they all got needs these days
I swear I'm coping
3 shots of henny and now she open
And I swear I need my space
I just tun up in the studio, dem man tun up in the raves
We don't relate
London to Connecticut, I swear the mandem play me
That boy Josif been too wavey, link up pending, things been crazy
Swear my feelings are incontrollable
I'm anti-social, man I never been so sociable
Yeah, and they just tell me that I've changed
I swear that they would feel the same if we both shared the same brain... man she the prototype
