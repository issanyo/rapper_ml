[Chorus: André 3000]
A boy to raise at a young age
No help from him, but she's alive
To be made strong, but all alone
Must be a pain, but she's alive

[Verse 1: André 3000]
The year was 1975
That night crickets cried
They knew what was goin' down
Three girls travel a long country road
And one said she thinks it's time
This baby wants to come right now

[Chorus: André 3000]
A boy to raise at a young age
No help from him, but she's alive
To be made strong, but all alone
Must be a pain, but she's alive

[Interlude: Woman talking]
I was scufflin' going to school, I was scufflin' working at night
And you know what? I truly believe
And that's why I tell a lot of parents, single parents
Don't tell me what God can't do
I made sure you had
I never felt like you should be deprived of anything
If a man didn't want to take care of his child, you move on
And that's what I did, I moved on

[Chorus: André 3000]
A boy to raise at a young age
No help from him, but she's alive
To be made strong, but all alone
Must be a pain, but she's alive
A boy to raise at, at a young, young age
No help from him, but she's alive

[Interlude: Woman talking]
He always wanted to be a father but he never took care of you
He ain't have no money, he ain't have nothin'
How can you care about somebody
And you never give the welfare of them?

[Chorus: André 3000]
A boy to raise at a young age
No help from him, but she's alive
To be made strong, but all alone
Must be a drag, but she's alive
A boy to raise at a young age
No help from him, but she's alive
To be made strong, but all alone
Must

[Interlude: Woman talking]
And I knew I had to go that road by myself

[Outro: André 3000]
She's alive
