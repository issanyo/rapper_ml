[Intro: Tink + Timbaland]
I gotta catch my flight, alright, alright, yeah
I can't be there somebody everyday
She said she found somebody and they hate me
And I'm gettin' the feelin' that she friendly creep
(Boy give me a call back)
That's what the message said
Now she stuck in my head
She said I never did
(Boy give me a call back)
She could be in a launcher
She bout to break my heart, she bout to break my heart

[Hook: Timbaland & Future]
I think my girl might be cheating on the low
She say she need her space and she say she need to go
Oh man, I think my girl might be cheating on the low
I really hate to say it, but tonight I need to know
Need to know, are you fucking other niggas? UFO, UFO
Are you fucking other niggas? UFO, UFO
Are you fucking other niggas? UFO, UFO
Are you fucking other niggas? UFO, UFO
I think my girl might be cheating...UFO, UFO

[Verse 1: Timbaland (Tink)]
She say she want somebody she can talk to
I always say I will but I never do
She says he need somebody she can count on
And when she dial my number, I don't pick it up
Alright, alright, girl
Now I gotta catch my flight
Alright, alright, girl
I can't be that somebody
Every day she say she find somebody and it ain't me
And I'm getting the feeling that she finna creep
(Boy give me a call back)
That's what the message said
That shit stuck in my head
She said I never did
(Boy give me a call back)
She could be in his arms
She 'bout to break my heart
She 'bout to break my heart

[Hook: Timbaland & Future]
I think my girl might be cheating on the low
She say she need her space and she say she need to go
Oh man, I think my girl might be cheating on the low
I really hate to say it, but tonight I need to know
Need to know, are you fucking other niggas? UFO, UFO
Are you fucking other niggas? UFO, UFO
Are you fucking other niggas? UFO, UFO
Are you fucking other niggas? UFO, UFO
I think my girl might be cheating...UFO, UFO

[Verse 2: Andre 3000]
Fuck that, double back
Park my car next to a puddle that
For everything that Andre 3000 it would irritate me
But I would rather see
My lover back
So I ran like hot bubble bath
To learn if my lover's laugh had come in rap
But bought this new hovercraft
It felt so bad
So I ran up the stairs and I stand with my peoples
Pull off her panties while she was still packin'
She responded like how I would have wanted
If I were leavin' and I'm ac'in
I said "woman tell me what is goin' on the air between us
And I love you"
Lord had conveyed it, the meanin' to me
And I mean it, Sabrina and Venus shoot
She keep up that record cause she wanna to keep scores
Fuck those habits
Like me and you those damn habits
Flip back on a mattress
And I will need answer the phone right away
If that I think we gone

[Hook: Timbaland & Future]
I think my girl might be cheating on the low
She say she need her space and she say she need to go
Oh man, I think my girl might be cheating on the low
I really hate to say it, but tonight I need to know
Need to know, are you fucking other niggas? UFO, UFO
Are you fucking other niggas? UFO, UFO
Are you fucking other niggas? UFO, UFO
Are you fucking other niggas? UFO, UFO
I think my girl might be cheating...UFO, UFO

[Verse 3: Tink]
He could be alone with a dancer
Hear it in his tone when he answer
Four or five hoes in a week
But if I go out to cheat
Then I have no standards
But tonight I'mma leave
Find me someone in these streets
Frequent them slowly and not feel emotion
Cause he would do the same to me no doubt
So I'mma get even, I never believed in you telling me a lie
I'mma get busy and find me a nigga to lay with tonight
Pimpin' ain't nothing but game, treat all these niggas the same
Niggas and women, we all lie about how we living
We all lie about where we staying
We all lie about who we laying, we all do
We all lie about who we cuffing
We all lie about who we fucking, we all do
Baby don't worry about me, I be on the run like B
You ain't gotta hide your face cause I'm probably in the room right next to your suite

[Hook: Timbaland & Future]
I think my girl might be cheating on the low
She say she need her space and she say she need to go
Oh man, I think my girl might be cheating on the low
I really hate to say it, but tonight I need to know
Need to know, are you fucking other niggas? UFO, UFO
Are you fucking other niggas? UFO, UFO
Are you fucking other niggas? UFO, UFO
Are you fucking other niggas? UFO, UFO
I think my girl might be cheating...UFO, UFO
