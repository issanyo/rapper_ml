[Intro: Gwen Stefani & Andre 3000]
We've got a long way to go
When snow hits the asphalt
Cold looks and bad talk come
We've got a long way to go
It's beyond Martin Luther

[Verse 1: Andre 3000 & Gwen Stefani]
His/her skin wasn't the same color as mine
But she/he was fine, he/she was fine
If all men are made equal, then
He/she was fine, she/he was fine
Up until the time we went out on a date
I was fine, I was fine
Now I'm getting dirty looks, I wonder what they'd say
If we were blind, we were blind peo-ple

[Chorus: Gwen Stefani & Andre 3000]
We've got a long way to go
When snow hits the asphalt
Cold looks and bad talk come
We've got a long way to go
It's beyond Martin Luther
Upgrade computer
We've got a long way to go
When snow hits the asphalt
Cold looks and bad talk come
We've got a long way to go
It's beyond Martin Luther

[Verse 2: Andre 3000 & Gwen Stefani]
Beauty is beauty, whether it's black or white
Yellow or green baby, you know what I meaaan
What if Picasso, only used one color?
There shouldn't be a rule how to choose your lover
Lovers in love is such a wonderful thing
Maybe in time we'll get together and sing
I really hope so, there's nothing wrong with this picture
We go a long way to go, we gotta get there quick
ERRRR

[Chorus: Gwen Stefani & Andre 3000]
We've got a long way to go
When snow hits the asphalt
Cold looks and bad talk come
We've got a long way to go
It's beyond Martin Luther
Upgrade computer
We've got a long way to go
When snow hits the asphalt
Cold looks and bad talk come
We've got a long way to go
It's beyond Martin Luther

[Bridge]
What color... is love?
What color... is love?
What color... is love?

[Chorus: Gwen Stefani & Andre 3000]
We've got a long way to go
When snow hits the asphalt
Cold looks and bad talk come
We've got a long way to go
It's beyond Martin Luther
Upgrade computer
We've got a long way to go
When snow hits the asphalt
Cold looks and bad talk come
We've got a long way to go
It's beyond Martin Luther

[Outro: Martin Luther King Junior's "I Have A Dream" speech]
.."that ALL men are created equal..."
"Children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by..."
"...the color of their skin..." "...but by the content of their character..."
"This will be the day when ALL God's children..."
"...will be able to sing with a new meaning..."
"...not only that..."
