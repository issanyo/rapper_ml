Damn
Life ain't nothing but a game to me
Niggas getting played and its plain to see
So many distractions keep us engaged with things
So imma break down the top 3 industries
They got billions in budget to advertise
To make it look like shit we wanna buy
Ads be color specific
Just to, ply in your feelings
They Not, just designed
To be attractive to your eyes
But if we knew that then would we cop
Or do we cop to compensate what we not
It's how we taught
It's Gon be hard to forgot
We all we got
So we gotta be gods
That's the only way we battling suits and ties
And keep the crew from doing stupid shit
On Lucifers time
Anybody see my account
They’ll lose they mind
I out here depending on what good looks can buy
And I been getting by
But u get jealous when i start scrolling
It seems much better to be where you posing
I even liked it, you didn't notice
I get lost with all them followers u bought
We living in this era of error
I'm on my Erykah
You can't put your iPhone down
So they keep making em
85 at a 5 IQ
Just think about that next time you type youtube
That's how they making them
Keep your lil boat tho it’s something to cruise too
Tracks make me track how much rain did I lose
How you even entertained
They giving bags to the losers
These the same niggas we used to shoot on in high school

Damn
Same nigga you used to laugh at think they the man now right
Well we been great still great
Aye

Go head thinking we give a damn
In the streets where kills dwell
The hood know I murdered
My people would never tell
Y’all should hear me more
Load the semi’s and start to
They kindergarten
Tryna jump up with a Demi-god
I’m bout a dollar
You penny proud
But this shit cost brother
Them blue folk ain't fucking with u
Say what you gross brother
I punch different
You punch cricket
Been killing since blue and gold lunch tickets
Come up missing
All you do is wine(whine) like drunk niggas
And front niggas
I’m bout business
I don’t jump niggas I front niggas
Re-up with me
Pull a profit
I pulled your docket
It’s all uncovered
These bars won’t be good for you Nicki Minaj brother
Ain't the whole clip
Just a couple line to make your nose drip
Shark pool you’ll get chewed just from a toe dip
Water cold
New fashion I had a hoes
That show they true color rainbows
Won’t get that pot of gold
Yea
Can’t make them wait when it’s something good
Get this shit shaking like good sex when she coming good
I could give a fuck if y’all listen
See that don’t get to me
Kuz like sucking dick in a marriage they will eventually
Head up your ass
You thinking shitty won’t get you pity
It just get you pissed on
While we litty in different cities
Grown ass man acting pussy
Bitch kitty
Sticking out your chest like you got you some new titties
Acting cool with me
We find out the you Mickey
It’s Heisman with the stiffy
Nigga we don’t do iffy
Turn him into ashes
Get him sprinkled like we splifting
Pistol handle feeling like a skateboard when I gripped it
Turn a angel when we lift you
Get you mangled when we blitz you
Ain't for luck if we pinch you
This summer we’ll be sending
Rappers obituaries with they name on it
Do an interlude
Bitches moaning with your main on it
Yea I got a range on me
I can hit your neck and your back
Might get Eizel and Khiyah to sang on it
Hit a nigga with shells like Taco Mel
For a nigga that tell it won’t go well
I’m cut from that cloth
I’ll make that logo sell
Used to be a postal worker
Yea I fucked with the mail
And you’ll get gift wrapped and packages
And rewrapped in bandages
Get busy
My wax litty, we run the candle biz’
Fuck Calabasas
Got dream to live in Beverly
All I really need is my dog to fuck with my pedigree
Shit, shit got be wavy without the head of grease
Every bar touched boy an angel
RIP to Deloreese
Yeah
