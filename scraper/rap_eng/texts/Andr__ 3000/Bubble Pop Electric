[Intro: Gwen & Johnny Vulture]
C'mon, Johnny! When you're gonna get here?
Alright, hold your pretty horses, I'll be there in a minute
You just get yourself dolled up, alright Tootsie?
You pick a place, you just pick a place!
Um, Johnny?
Yeah, Gwennie-Gwen-Gwen?
You might wanna hurry, because tonight is the night!

[Verse 1: Gwen Stefani]
I'm empty
I need fulfilling, yes I do love
A-to the ceiling when I do love
I get this feeling when I'm in love
I'm restless
Can't you see I try my bestest?
To be good girl, because it's just us
So take me now and do me justice
I'm waiting
A-patiently anticipating
Your arrival and I'm hating
It takes so long to get to my house
To take me out

[Hook: Gwen Stefani]
Tonight, I'm gonna give you all my love in the back seat
Bubble Pop Electric
Bubble Pop Electric
Gonna speed it down and slow it up in the backseat
Bubble Pop Electric
Uh-oh, in the backseat!

[Verse 2: Gwen Stefani]
Okay now
I understand he's on his way now
But jeez Louise, I mean today now
I can't wait, I wanna play now
I'm antsy
Bubble Pop Electric pansies
My sweet tooth, I want your candy
The Queen of Eng would say it's randy
I'm itchy
I wish you would come and scratch me
Tonight, I'm falling, won't you catch me?
Swoop on by so you can snatch me and take me out

[Hook: Gwen Stefani]
Tonight, I'm gonna give you all my love in the back seat
Bubble Pop Electric
Bubble Pop Electric
Gonna speed it down and slow it up in the backseat
Bubble Pop Electric
Uh-oh, in the backseat!

[Interlude: Gwen Stefani & Johnny Vulture]
(I'll get it!)
The need to be satisfied
(Hey Johnny! Lemme go grab my sweater)
Come pick me up, I want a ride
(Hi, Mrs. Stefani) (Bye, Mom!)
Hurry, hurry come to me
(So, baby where you wanna go, huh?)
Drive-in movie
Drive in, move me
Drive into me

[Bridge: Gwen Stefani]
Bubble Pop Electric, you've gotta get it
Straight to me, drive-in movie
Take it to the back seat, run it like a track meet
Come to me, drive-in movie
Bubble Pop Electric, you've gotta get it
Straight to me, drive-in movie
Take it to the back seat, run it like a track meet
Come to me, drive-in movie

[Hook: Gwen Stefani]
Tonight, I'm gonna give you all my love in the back seat
Bubble Pop Electric
Bubble Pop Electric
Gonna speed it down and slow it up in the backseat
Bubble Pop Electric
Uh-oh, in the backseat!

[Outro: Gwen Stefani & Johnny Vulture]
Yeah, tell your father, I said 'ello!
Johnny, get outta here!
