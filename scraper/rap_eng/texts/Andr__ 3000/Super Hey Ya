[Verse 1]
One two three uh!
My baby don't mess around
Because she loves me so
And this I know fo' sho' (Uh!)
But, does she really wanna?
But can't stand to see me
Walk out the door
Don't try to fight the feelin'
'Cause the thought alone is killing me right now (Uh!)
Thank god for Mom and Dad
For sticking two together
'Cause we don't know how (Uh!)

[Hook]
Hey ya...

[Verse 2]
You think you've got it
Oh, you think you've got it
But got it just don't get it
Till there's nothing at all (Mamma mia!) (Uh!)
We get together
Oh, we get together
But separate's always better when there's feelings involved (Mamma mia!) (Uh!)
If what they say is, "Nothing is forever,"
Then what makes, then what makes, then what makes
Then what makes, then what makes love the exception? (Mamma mia!)
So why you, why you, why you
Why you, why you, why you
Are we so in denial when we know we're nothing but happy here? (Pikachu!)
Y'all don't want me here you just wanna dance

[Bridge]

And we gonna break this thing down in just a few seconds
Now don't have me break this thing down for nothin'
Now I wanna see y'all on y'all baddest behavior
Lend me some sugar, I am your neighbour. Ahh, here we go!
Shake it, sh-shake it, shake it (Oh oh!) Sh-shake it
Shake it, sh-shake it, shake it, shake it (Oh oh!) Sh-shake it
Shake it like a Polaroid Picture, hey ya
Shake it, sh-shake it, shake it, sh-shake it

And baby dolls, get on the floor

Shake it, sh-shake it, shake it, sh-shake it
Shake it, sh-shake it, shake it, shake it, sh-shake it
