[Intro: Nia Andrews & Kelly Rowland]
Have it, yeah

[Verse 1: Solange]
First one's a fool, who'll be the fool now?
Who's gonna get in line?
First one to go, first one to fight the way
Let's go to moonlight, then they will never find
Let's go to home, free from the mother mind
Come on along, along, along, along, along, along, along

[Chorus: André 3000]
Jump on it
Jump on it, on it
Jump on it
Jump on it

[Bridge: Solange]
Hit 'em with a left
Hit 'em with they knock, knock
Hit 'em with a play
Then away, and away, and away, and away
Hit 'em with a knock, knock
Hit 'em on the top
Hit 'em when they flock, flock
Hit 'em with a shock, shock
Then away, and away, and away, and away
Hit 'em when they watch
Hit 'em with a dot, dot, dot, dot, dot
Then I'm up, up, up and away, and away, and away, and away
Hit 'em when they watch
Hit 'em when they cop, cop, cop what you got
Then away, and away, and away, and away, and away, and away

[Chorus: André 3000]
Jump on it
Jump on it, on it
Jump on it
Jump on it
Jump

[Verse 3: Solange]
You want to be the teacher
Don't want to go to school
Don't want to do the dishes
Just want to eat the food
But what you gonna do
When they saw all your moves and practiced em daily?
Protect your neck, or give invitations?
