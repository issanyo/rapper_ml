[Intro: Mystikal]
This is, Mystikal and Outkast
I'm representin'

[Verse 1: Mystikal]
I'm out for the big bucks and NO WHAMMIES, goddammit
You can't stand it!
Make 'em feel the impact and I ain't even in Miami
Handlin' with my man 'nem in Atlanta
And they payin' me 'cause they know I bring the kinda shit you feelin' as I'm sayin it
I'm like the NBA sore thumb
Or a pawn shop Tec 9, bitch, I'm known for jammin'
Smoke Mary, Mary, Mary
Put a mean ass flow on top of bad vocabulary
I bust through, intrude, move through distractions
Withstand hits and blows, don't lose no traction
I threw a round off flip flop flip flop back at em
If a nigga come in clown then I'm gon' get the cannon
And then get God back
Knuckle up boy, don't be no fuck boy
Me and Guillotine we run some niggas in a big truck boy
Run flat boy, run that boy
Bitch, where I'mma send you, you can't come back, boy
I bring flames to a four alarm fire
I wash him up and wring him out, now throw him in the dryer
I hit the door, I'm blowin' him like Southern band
And they always tryin' to find something to say about the brotherman
I invent 'em, flip 'em, and send 'em
Rhymes get jumped off like I pulled King Kong for ya
Guess what? This is a stick-up
Give me back my shit before I start pickin' bricks up
Garbage MCs better run for it
Don't come this way 'cause you can't walk on this side of the yard forty
And respect me for takin' it to 'em
So expect me to lay it down and represent my neck of the woods

[Big Boi]
Yeah, like that, ha ha, ha ha, yeah, yeah, yeah
Mystikal and OutKast, ha ha

[Hook 2X: André 3000]
If it don't bump off in the club, you can't rock
If it ain't 808 in the trunk, it ain't knock
If you round our neck of the woods, you better stop
'Cause the people on the block gonna show you where to drop, ahhhh

[Verse 2: Big Boi]
Call me the Heat Miser, the beat riser
The nigga that spit that street fire
Mystikal, André, and Big Boi taking 'em out of the park like Mark McGwire
Sosa, you so so, your rhymes are small like Toto
You're bitchmade like Dorothy, you belong in a sorority
I'mma call you Cocoa, or Candy
Go sing a song with Brandy
Quit rhymin' and double timin', what is you sayin', G?
I'm taking my thirteenth shot of Cuervo Gold
My style is drunken
And you know we doin' the beat big, oh hell yeah, it's gonna be bumpin'
Giving you something to beat the block with, with the cops swift
My stamina's incredible, so sucka, don't try to stop this
The D-U-N-G-E-O-N Family, merrily
Life is but a dream, I mean a nightmare 'cause it's scaring me
But I live, gotta give, one-double-O percent above the rest Yeah, Daddy Fat Sacks gon' burst, and you know that, YEAH

Yeah, know that, East Point never stop like that
All the way to Decatur

[Hook 2X: André 3000]
If it don't bump off in the club, you can't rock
If it ain't 808 in the trunk, it ain't knock
If you round our neck of the woods, you better stop
'Cause the people on the block gonna show you where to drop, ahhhh

[Verse 3: André 3000]
Hey, what's your name?
André 3000, the year to fear is already here
Must look beyond, sounds from the center of the sun
Reason for a gun, only one
Strong believer in self-preservation
Aahhhhh, OOF!
In the State of confused
City of forgotten fate, County of the blues
Street address Generation X Avenue
But Generation Y high to the point
That a joint won't anoint a new one
Walking in my silver boots, need a shoehorn and some church socks
What if I told you he manipulate clocks?
Stops, time rewinds, see what he finds
Then re-arrange and change things that's on your mind
Would you swallow like fine wine or peanut butter?
Would you holler that I'm lying and ask another?
Or pay no heed and run for cover?

[Hook 3X: André 3000]
If it don't bump off in the club, you can't rock
If it ain't 808 in the trunk, it ain't knock
If you round our neck of the woods, you better stop
'Cause the people on the block gonna show you where to drop, ahhhh
