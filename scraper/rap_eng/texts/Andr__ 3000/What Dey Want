(Hook : Deijay)
I Give Em What Dey Want And If I Dont The Next Wheel And
Lord Knows That'll Be Less Dollar Bills I Keep It Rollin Like
Thomas Was The Next Wheel And Have Em Telling All
They Friends How The Sex Feel 

(Verse 1 : Deijay)
Pop It Up Im In That Drunk N Love Boo put a pillow under you
Pull Yo Hair And Kiss Ya Neck While I Make Love To You
At The Same Baby I Just Wanna Know Do You Know Where
Home Is That's Were Alone Is We,Was High And Drunk
Hair Kind Of Jacked Up I Dont Know Where The Comb Is
I Just Wanna Love You Baby Kiss You Love You, Hug You Bay
See how it feels all night I just wanna make sure it feels

(Hook: Andre 3000
I Give Em What Dey Want And If I Don't The Next Wheel
And Lord Knows That'll Be Less Dollar Bills I Keep It Rollin
Like Thomas Was The Next Wheel And Have Em Telling
All They Friends How The Sex Feel

(Verse 2 : Andre 3000
Shawty Said I Was Mysterious Pussy Got Me Delirious
My Silver Dark Gold Got It Shining toward new liver
Keep that pussy nice and wet like the nile river
And the bright blue sea I want you to be mine again
I want us to shine again you brighten my mind now
Baby Girl You're So Damn Fine Tho Wine Im Sipping
On Make Me Ring like chimes tho you got yo heart
Sucking niggas in like science water splashed cause
Of the protest I dont understand why you dont wanna have no sex they come back and them hoes next

(Hook : Deijay And Andre3'000
I Give Em What They Want And If I Dont The Next Wheel
And Lord Knows That'll Be Less Dollar Bills I Keep It Rolling
Like Thomas Was The Next Wheel And Have Em Telling All
They Friends How The Sex Feel
