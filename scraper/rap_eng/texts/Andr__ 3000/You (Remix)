[Verse 1: André 3000]
I said, "What time you get off?"
She said, "when you get me off"
I kinda laughed, but it turned into a cough
Because I swallowed down the wrong pipe
Whatever that mean, you know old people say it so it sounds right
So I'm standing there embarassed, if we were both in Paris
I would have grabbed her by the waist and kissed her, but
We in the middle of Whole Foods, and those foods
Ain't supposed to beef, but you'd think they hated tofu
Check-in line got rowdy, my vision got cloudy
I started seein' circles like some Audi emblem
I'm hearing them say, "Come on, man"
"Do this own your own time, get the hell on, man"
I walked out, hm, I got 'bout
Halfway to my car when I heard shorty shout
"3000, forgot your credit card—smart move"
"By the way, my little sister loves your cartoon"
"Well, here's my name and numb'"
"If I ain't the one, lose it, if I am, use it"
"If a man chooses and he can do's it"
And if he don't, don't take it personal
He might be might be swamped
With making mozzarella—no, making worlds better
Cheese will come, believe me I'm
Never focused on the cash
Ask Mel Gibson, Jesus Christ I'm 'bout the passion

[Verse 2: Lloyd]
STOP, baby bring that thang back
You know where my heart at
Shawty, show ya boy some love
Cause I'm about to lose it
With the way you move it
Makes me wanna get to it
Girl tell me what it do
I'll change the game for you
I'm a playa, yes it's true, but...

[Hook: Lloyd]
Can I be for real?
This is how I feel
I'm in need of love
So let's dip up out of here
Oooh, you just my type
Everything so right
And I just wanna chill
So let's dip up out of here
Let's dip up out of here

[Bridge: Lloyd]
Ahh, ahh-ahh, ahhh-ahhhh...
She's fine too, but I want you...
Ahh, ahh-ahh, ahhh-ahhhh...
She's fine too, but I want you...

[Verse 3: Lloyd]
I'll admit it, this just ain't no game
These just ain't words that I'm spittin
If you can see the thoughts that's in my head
I'm trippin, I'm a player, it's true
But I'll change the game for you
Wanna see what it do, oooh...

[Hook + Bridge]

[Verse 4: Nas]
Yeah, Nas be in the crib low, strip polin' it
Cold Guinness, bitter taste, slim waist, I'm gon' hit it
We low-key baby, like a baritone
Apple com-puter, e-mail me to come scoop ya
Run through ya, undo ya bra, gimme medulla, uh
You cute as a movie star, in sin city, Hennessy, my love slave
Lovin' is pimpin', no rest 'have, with none of 'em
I would leave every one of 'em, you just say it
Just leave it where it is, he ain't aware of sleep and dogs lie
But keep a sharp eye on him, 'cause I'm the wrong guy
To wanna put this four-five on 'em, let's get it on, ma
You got my nose wide open
You already locked down and rot down, but so delicious
If he get suspicious, bring up his old mistress
I ain't dry-snitchin', but why should you be feelin' bad
'Cause I be killin' that, huh?

[Hook + Bridge]
