[Verse 1]
Why worry bout a chick when I could worry bout a dollar
I see options I see options
When I'm walking on the collar
Whipped

Stop
Why worry bout a itty bitty problem when I still tryna breathe
Why stop in the road when I could proceed


Why look for the fall
When there are no leaves
Why look for the pod
When you got no peas
Why look for the love
With your enemies?
Why act like your blind
When you can still see?

I ain't got the answers
Still on the search
Like I got the cancer
On my tippy toes
Like a ballet dancer
Green for the team
You should Check the banner


I'm berry Fanta
I'm koolaid jammer
I'm pinker panther
My rights Miranda
Im flow enhancer
No necromaner
Don't play with answers
I question dancers

You know it's hard sometimes
To try to live a lie
So tell your truth inside the booth
Don't need worry bout hard times



Look!!!
3 fingers in the air (yea)

Read inbetween the lines (yea)

Don't worry or scare (yea)

Best won't be behind (yea)

It's the way I flow
Rattle with the cattle for the rodeo
I don't need to lie with pinnochio
To see a lie when my truth goes head to toe
You know?


[Hook]
Swiming in a sea of cess!
(Call me nemo)
In atlantis with my goggles
Where my mango?
Don't call NATO
In the eye of the tornadoooo
Ayo...

[Verse 2 (Zey Ingram)]
Him be seldom at the function m y= g-u-y

In Kuai to keep it genuwine
The junction in my heart is just a vibe

Can your happiness maybe buy a minute of your time
It said let me get that thang
Get that thang get it supper size
(Yea Yea Yea)
AYE!

Vomit it, set in stone like robby, jaw locked up and hot in it like bobby free the hommie bruh

Ramadan wit sweater on
Par not subby like a tommy gun sike

On my bike having fun run run run   zoom zoom its up to you
Watchu gon do?
Yea fight or run
Better not hide your face nor hide your pun
'duction coming out the work
Need free time i did my dirt
Pineapples on pizza don't let their opinions change you
Don't let let your prior responsibilities name you
(hi im busy)

Swiming in a sea of cess!
