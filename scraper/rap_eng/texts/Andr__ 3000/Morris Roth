[Chorus]
Don't mean nothin'
Just keep it coming, crazy
'Cause I been thinkin' bout you lately
I know it may seem new to you, to you
But anyway

[Verse 1: Asher Roth]
Come on give me a break
There's a few things that I just can't take
I'm testy with a slight pet peeve so
Miss, jeez would you please stop doing that?
(Stop doing that!)
I'm new to rap, thought you knew that
Say my name and the crowd goes "Who dat?" (Who dat?)
Judo slap, dude get a clue back, that be Ash and the way that he move that
Marching band, jam with a tuba
Trumpets flare, they'll be standing you up
The bass drum will thunder the air
While I'm snappin' the snare 'till the damn thing blew up
You up, do what I do and the beat comes in
And the fans be rootin' (root root)
For me
Fans keep booin'
For you
Band keep goin...

[Chorus]
Don't mean nothin'
Just keep it coming, crazy
'Cause I been thinkin' bout you lately
I know it may seem new to you, to you
But anyway

Don't mean nothin'
Just keep it coming, crazy
'Cause I been thinkin' bout you lately
I know it may seem new to you, to you
But anyway


[Verse 2: Asher Roth]
(Oh yeah) Back to what bugs me
You emcees, must be clumsy
Humpty Dumpty, crack head druggies
Say dumb things, you just disgust me
Above the bad influence
Rap is dead, I thought you knew it?
So true it, is boo-hoo it (Boo hoo)
Need new nerds to come reboot it (Boop)
Come re-tool it
Jet engine, yes let's refuel it
So fluent, flow's congruent
All new sound, all new music
Prove it, listen to it
Offer you an all inclusive, viewin'
Two-tone unit, half rap act half college student
Intruding, rude entrance, introducing a new movement
Move it, just keep moving
One and two and drum and boom and
You up, do what I do and the beat comes in
And the fans be rootin' (root root)
For me
Fans keep booin'
For you
Band keep goin...

[Chorus]
Don't mean nothin'
Just keep it coming, crazy
'Cause I been thinkin' bout you lately
I know it may seem new to you, to you
But anyway

Don't mean nothin'
Just keep it coming, crazy
'Cause I been thinkin' bout you lately
I know it may seem new to you, to you
But anyway
