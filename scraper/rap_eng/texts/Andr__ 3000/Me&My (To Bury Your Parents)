[Verse]
Me and my mother drivin' to the grocery store
Me ridin' shotgun with my window rolled down
She smoked cigarettes and gets what she gets by
Hustlin' harder, rollers and a nightgown
Me and my father driving to the football game
Me ridin' shotgun, my window rolled down
He sipped Cognac and kept us all laughin'
I was much happier when he was around
When he was around
Zen, he was around

[Instrumental Interlude]

[Refrain]
Around
Around
Around
Me and my mother
Me and my father
Me and my—
Me and my—
Me and—
Me and—
Me and–
