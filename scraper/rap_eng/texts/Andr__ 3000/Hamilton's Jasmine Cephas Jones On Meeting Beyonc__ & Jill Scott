I am like walking the streets of New York handing out my body parts to try to purchase a ticket.

[Jasmine Cephas Jones]
I know it's so hard.

[Michael Korte]
But the Obamas have been there

[Jasmine Cephas Jones]
Yeah

[Michael Korte]
Beyoncé & Jay have been there

[Jasmine Cephas Jones]
Yes they have.
Queen Bey.

[Michael Korte]
Queen Bey. Everyone has been there.
Do you have a favorite thats come to see Hamilton?

[Jasmine Cephas Jones]
Beyoncé, I--I like fell to the floor. Like I didn't do that in front of her, but after she left I like maybe shed a tear and like freaked out. Um, my other favorite is Lawrence Fishburne. He literally, like, just gave all of--he looked like a proud father. Like he just embraced all of us, and he was--he was like "I'm just so proud of everybody in this room." And I felt like family member, you know, at--at that moment. There's like--there's so many--like last night I had no idea Jill Scott was here and André 3000. You know what I'm saying? Like I just wanted to run up to her and say "Woke up this morning."

[Michael Korte]
Did you?

[Jasmine Cephas Jones]
No, I didn't, and like I wish that I did but like I--I don't know. It's just like you never know who's gonna be there. Like you do--you do an almost 3 hour performance and you get off and it's amazing because you see--you see all these famous people but it's like--your just on--in a moment where you're on the same plane as them because their artists too, and their just so full. When you can perform for people and influence them, and their crying, and their just feeling all these feelings like that's you're goal, as an actor or a performer to make these people walk away with something. And to see all these famous people full with something and you know you--you've watched them, you've seen them on stage, you've seen them in films, or on YouTube and you get so full, and like to have that opportunity to give that to them. And for them to be so proud of you. It's just like--I don't have any words for it you know! Like I--Yeah.
