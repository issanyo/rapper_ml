[Intro : Mara Hruby]
Hey yaaa... Ba-doo-baaaa-ba-doo-baaaaa
[x2]

[Verse 1 : Mara Hruby]
Baby, take off your cool
I wanna see you, I wanna see you
Baby, don't you be so cool
I wanna see you, I wanna see you

[Verse 2 : Cavin]
I want to have some interaction
That means a little bit of affection
Don't worry baby girl I'll be your protection
Getting to know you is a blessing, but my love for you is what I'm testing
The world is a mess, and I'm trying to get you before I am deeply depressed
At first it was practicing in the mirror
Now it's failing after that second semester, but I can't say I love you any clearer
I am overlooked in music and relationships
Girl I know we have been through some hardships, but we got to look over it to get anywhere in life's transcripts
I'm there whenever, wherever; however, My world right now isn't great
We met by fate
I hope one day I can take you on a legit date
The feeling of you in love with me makes me think great
But in the end another guy will come in and take your heart away
And there goes my chance at being your boyfriend and so I'm late
I'm late

[Outro : Mara Hruby]
Baby, take off your cool
I want to get to know you
(Take off your cool)
