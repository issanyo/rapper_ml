The CD single

[Andre Benjamin]
Never has ev-ery member in one crew been so diverse
Tryin to outdo the last verse that I birthed, that is my curse
Your knight in rhyming armor sentimentally slay all grand dragons
Grab the sharpest No. 2 then I'm stabbin
Somebody let me a hold a No. 2 pencil cause they testin
Somebody let me a hold a No. 2 pencil cause they testin

[Witchdoctor]
I fly through the night, yeah
Mixing 'Card with some Sprite, lyrics we put inside ya
Listen to these A-T-L riders (hooo hooooo!)
Keep your head straight, the street's full of snakes
Slithering, making.. deals, delivering
UHH uh uh, that weed got you shivering
Paranoia, fifteen hundred go to the lawyer
After paying his rent, dollars and cents
They're stealing pit-BULLS, put up a fence
We movin on, tell the crew it's on

[Cee-Lo]
'Kay, here it go
They call me Sugar Baby Shawty Lo
I'm one fourth of the migh-ty
G-double-O, D-and-the-I-and-the-E, the M-and-the-O

[Khujo]
Yo, this ain't no chain to your brain
Pistol and they gon' bang, plus drain ya
Like some Folgers ? ya now
Get in touch with your clothes

[Cee-Lo]
Tellin ya home
Anybody disrespect my zone
We gon' get it on til we get it gone
And y'all might get it right
But you gettin in wrong
Or you gonna get shot and blown

[Khujo]
Out here the volume workin ?
Stankin cops get your skull split
And gettin with it figuratively
It's just that I showed them
Now they tried roll out
Hopin we'd be on, back in the weight room son
Think of a spot, we'd keep all day
Choppin for the live spots
The thug take your head off your shoulders
Like we take the lid off a jar!

[Big Gipp]
Yeah, look here, been here
Dis here's, diss year's
Gipp one of the firest
To lay it down round here
Gold and the platinum all over the walls
If you ever check the hook it have big balls
Laid it down hard more than one {fuckin} time
Go ahead and get it gone, now I'm out my mind
Went from hubcaps and 30's to the honey spokes
People still talkin bout the last rhyme I wrote
Eighty-seven was the year that I first stepped in
I'm hollerin at Big D, doin time in the pen, I say

[Big Boi]
One of the dope boys done crept in
Steppin all over your best friends
No weapons just lyrical lessons
And smoked out sessions
The Young and the Restless
Some of the best in the Dirty South
And Midwestern, hemisphere
They wanna be this here, the playa the B-O-I
Gonna run these verses and make you see this here
{Niggas} tried to jock it
I put my plug off in they girl's socket
Know, the D to the F is gon' forever rock it
Lock it, down (yeah, yeah)

[T-Mo]
The T stands for T-Mo, who's known as a teacher
SouthWest young brother, bringin the pain through your speaker!
It's like a disease to fiend for the cheese you need
Come up and ease the feelin, exhibit and chillin
While dealin with the devil himself, increase my wealth be
More than ten times the average minimum wage
College brethren these days done changed the recipe
Steady taxin creatively maximize with proper investments
Can't be hesitant with them dead presidents
Or you lose, or you could lose your ? but no tools

[Cee-Lo]
For whateva time I got left, I'mma holla and scream D-F
For whateva time I got left, I'mma holla and scream D-F

[Cool Breeze]
I know a whole lot of brothers in the rap game
But most of them are in it for the shiny thangs
They wanna snatch all ten, maybe stack about fo'
They wanna live in the house but don't want no grass to grow
See what you need to do is learn the tricks of the trade
Go to work, put it down, and den get paid
It's only two of us gon' get caught for makin the sale
I'm one and if you the other bruh, I can't tell
Can't nobody think they come in, and get in the zone
Tryin to kill fo' birds with about fifteen stones

The C stands for Cool Breeze who's known as the champ
Freddy Calhoun, the coolest cutta at camp
Ay, my one's and my two's got your whole town shook
You betta listen to your corner, and watch for the hook
