[Verse 1: André 3000]
I, I, I left no time to regret
Kept my dick wet with that same old bed
Oh, and you, you and your head high
And your tears dry - get on without your guy

And I, I, I went back to a anew
So far removed from all we've been through
Oh-oh-oh, and you and you and you
You tread a troubled track
Your odds are always stacked
You'll go back to black

We only said goodbye with words
I know a hundred times
I'd go back to her
And you go back to...
You go back to...

[Verse 2: Beyoncé]
I, I love you much - it's not enough
I love blowing you lovepuff
And life is like a pipe
And I'm a tiny penny rolling up the walls inside

We only said goodbye with words
I died a hundred times
You go back to her
And I go back to...

We only said goodbye with words
I died a hundred times
You go back to her
And I go back to...
I go back to black
