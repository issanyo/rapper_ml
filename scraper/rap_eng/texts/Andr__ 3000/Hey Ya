One, two, three, go

My baby don't mess around me
'Cause she loves me so and this I know for sure
Uh, but does she really wanna
But can't stand to see me walk out the door?

Don't try to fight the feelin'
'Cause the thought alone is killing me right now
Uh, thank God for mom and dad for sticking two together
'Cause we don't know how

Hey ya, hey ya, hey ya, hey ya
Hey ya, hey ya, hey ya, hey ya

You think you've got it, oh, you think you've got it
But got it just don't get it 'til there's nothing at all
We get together, oh, we get together
But separate's always better when there's feelings involved

If what they say is, "Nothing is forever"
Then what makes, then what makes, then what makes
Then what makes, what makes, what makes, love exception

So why you, why you, why you, why you, why you
Are we so in denial? When you know we're not happy here
Y'all don't wanna hear me you just wanna dance
(Hey ya, hey ya)

Don't want to meet your daddy
(Hey ya, hey ya)
Just want you in my caddy
(Hey ya, hey ya)

Don't want to meet your momma
(Hey ya, hey ya)
Just want to make you cumma
(Hey ya, hey ya)

I'm, I'm, I'm just being honest
(Hey ya, hey ya)
I'm just being honest

Lend me some suga', I am your neighbor
Ah, here we go

Shake it, shake, shake it, shake it, shake, shake it
Shake it, shake, shake it, shake it, shake it, shake
Shake, shake it, like a polaroid picture, hey ya

Shake it, shake it, shake, shake it, shake it, shake
Shake it, shake it, shake it, shake it, suga
Shake it like a polaroid picture

Now while Beyonce's and Lucy Lius
And baby dolls, get on the floor
Get on the floor, you know what to do
You know, what to do, you know I do

Hey ya, hey ya, hey ya, hey ya
Hey ya, hey ya, hey ya, hey ya
