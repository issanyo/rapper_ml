[Chorus]
You know it when you see it
You know it when it's there
Like Michael Jackson Thriller
Like Farrah Fawcett Hair
It's good shit
It's good shit
It's good shit
Oh yeah

While listening to Bitches Brew as recorded by Miles Davis

André 3000

[Verse: André 3000]
Full length mirrors and her hair in a bun
Kids with big glasses that laugh when they run
Girls with old school names, like Ruby Mae
Or how infants with baby breath yawn in your face
Or getting tucked in every night for a month
By all of the American Apparel ad girls
American Apparel ad and girls
You know what I mean?

I like it when you're under the ocean and all you can feel is calm
I like it when I'm sleeping
I like it when I'm listening to music because that's the only thing that takes me to another world (another world)
I like it when public bathrooms have scented candles
I like it when you talk to me like that
I like it when my hair is fluffy
I like it when it rains at night and I'm curled up in bed with a good book
I like it when i turn my head around and I catch you looking back

[Chorus]
You know it when you see it
You know it when it's there
Like Michael Jackson Thriller
Like Farrah Fawcett Hair
It's good shit (I like it when you play with my hair)
It's good shit (I like it when you play with my hair)
It's good shit (I like it when you play with my hair)
Oh yeah (I like it when you play with my hair)
You know it when you see it
You know it when it's there
Like Michael Jackson Thriller
Like Farrah Fawcett Hair
It's good shit
It's good shit
It's good shit
Oh yeah

[Outro: Frank Tavares]
That's not right
