[Andre: intro (Hook)]

On some spooky dooky shit (spooky dooky)
B-O-O-G-I-E M-A-N
You know the one who make ya'll suckers wanna run
The one that make you wanna spend more QT with your son
Nobody that I know no longer do this shit for fun I am the
B-O-O-G-I-E M-A-N
You know the one who make a sugar drop her drawers
I dig her cause she's honest and she do me just because
She wanna and I wanna that's on the Niagara Falls I am the...

[Big Gipp]
You can catch me in a white DTS with the top popped
Little buddy under my seat
It shoot hot rocks
Make the sucka Po' get loose
Jiggy purr with me shorty jiggy purr ya gurl
Candle lights the world swiftly
Big Gipp AKA the city miracle mutant motherfucker from birth
I stay down for the ready-ready
Caught some media, spaghetti
Off in Japan they call me Yeti
I'm the Boogie Man

[Andre 3000: Hook]

[Big Gipp]
I'm Mr. Boogie Boogie from the goodie goodie Gipp
Put my oogie oogie between your camel foot, so stay put
A straight dog when I'm chasing the platypus
My intellectual qualities superior to most
I love a girl with a fat back
Knee cut, rack, toes showing, Po'
Holdin my eyes swollen
Cause I stare so hard, with no regard
Girl make that change, Shake that thang mama!

[Andre 3000: Hook]

[Big Gipp]
Touched what I never touched before
Seen what I never seen before
Woke up and seen the sun Sky high, sky high
Baby girl didn't even tell me bye-bye
She was gone without dropping the digits
She was gone without using my kitchen
She left without kissing my lips
One more time I wanna hold them hips
I hope we meet up again on a lunar eclipse
