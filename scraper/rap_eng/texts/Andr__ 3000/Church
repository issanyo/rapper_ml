Man, have you ever really wondered
Like why are we here? What the meanin to all of this?

[Hook: Sleepy Brown]
Sometimes life can keep you down, with your face all in the dirt
(HALL-LE-LU-JAH)
Now if you feel that left behind, need to get up and go to church
(HALL-LE-LU-JAH)
Ooooh, ooooh, ooooh, ooooh, ooooh, ooooh, ooooh, ooooh
(HALL-LE-LU-JAH)
Ooooh, ooooh, ooooh, ooooh..
(HALL-LE, LU-JAH)

[Verse One: Big Boi]
Big, slide into the mode, time to drop a load
My life is going downhill like some cardboard in the snow
My bank account is frozen, I
Don't think that I can get out this hold
Feel like the figure four leglock
Like the jury went away and then they came back deadlocked
I can't move, I can't eat, I can't even breathe
Can't even buy a decent sack without the stems and the seeds
No trees, no P's to ease the stress of everyday living
But homeless people gotta suck it up wherever they living
The unforgiven or the unwilling, live a life of sinning
And expect to be as pure as an infant in the beginning
Butâ€”what about repentance?
What about detention?
What about you eating dinner in the devil's kitchen?
What about repentance?
What about committing the same sin
Over and over again and again and ah..

[Hook - singers]
Why are we here? Huh? Huh? Huh?
Please tell me - what are we here foooooooorrrrrrrrrr?
OW!

[Verse Two: Big Boi]
Life, is nothing but a dream, so peaceful and serene
Unless you're being evil then you on the devil's team
Wide receive what you want to believe
But soon you'll have to sew those bad seeds
Please, any man can ask to get a pass
Or a cleansing of sin to grant another chance
Perhaps another glance of the light at the end of the tunnel
Talk to the coach or break out the huddle
Whatever should you fumble your rebuttal should be subtle
'Cause he who lives in the upper room is never gullible
As you survey the syllables and sentences
The question that I'm merely trying to pose is as simple as me saying
What about repentance?
What about detention?
What about you eating dinner in the devil's kitchen?
What about repentance?
What about committing the same sin
Over and over again and again and ah..

[Hook: Sleepy Brown]
Sometimes life can keep you down, with your face all in the dirt
Now if you feel that left behind, need to get up and go to church
Ooooh, ooooh, ooooh, ooooh, ooooh, ooooh, ooooh, ooooh
Ooooh, ooooh, ooooh, ooooh..

[Hook - singers]
Why are we here? Huh? Huh? Huh?
Please tell me - what are we here foooooooorrrrrrrrrr?
OW!
