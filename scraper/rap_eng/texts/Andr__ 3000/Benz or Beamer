{"It all started at an accident scene on Bankhead and Ashby
It's not clear if the suspect caused it; it is clear he wielded
A hammer and told ..... to get out of his car."}

[Verse 1]
[Big Boi]
Yeah, now check it
From alligator belts to patty melts, I be that smoothest nigga
So how do you figure that Atlanta don't be pullin dem triggas?
The Southernplayalistic pimp is up in this bitch
Man, my folkers up on that track, complimentin' that wickedness
See one is for the money, two is for my niggas who jack
Niggas ain't takin' that shit no mo', they got big Benz and Cadillac
My gat is in my lap, so whatchu wanna be startin' now?
I'm pissin' up on Jeffrey's Dahmer grave, that cracker was foul

[André 3000]
Too close for comfort, too close to home
Too close to be playin' your boy, so hey, why don't you get your own?
As long, as I got this legally
People see that we can be on top of things without causin' another nigga sorrow
I know it seems it ain't enough to go around
But keep on holdin' on like Goodie Mob 'cause it's a better day tomorrow
That's all I can say, can't tell the future
Tomorrow's another day but today, they just might shoot you
For your ride, fuck your pride, hide better be out your seat
Quick and snappy with a happy face before you bleed
Ask me, if that material shit is worth your life
I don't know about yours, but if so, you smoking pipes, right?

[Hook 4X]
Either want a Benz or a Beamer

[Verse 2]
[André 3000]
Deep in the Dungeon for these many months
Amongst the Dungeon Dragon as we pass around dem blunts
Had to cut it out like shears, but for years I used to burn 'em
Gettin deep off in my thoughts just to get shit off my sternum
Chest/chess, I never played but made many a moves
I still blame it on the session 'cause I can't remember the due
I guess, I feel that getting a Benz is out of the question
The world is yelling Hootie Hoo but in my pockets nuthin but
Gum and lint, to sum the shit, up, I'm broke
Nothin' but hope, so Big Boi, tell 'em what you toke

[Big Boi]
I'm travellin' up to Jersey with four keys off in my trunk
And thinkin' of startin' the ways to get that motherfucker crunk
See yes I be that nigga that with that sess off in my chest
Smokin' and chokin' them token blacks, that wanted to test
See strong niggas survive and the weak niggas they die
I never fuck no white bitch, I stopped eatin' at pig stys
Be activatin that Lo-Jack 'cause the Fleetwood has been stolen
Campbellton Road is open, the B-I-G has spoken
'Cause it's like this

[Hook 4X]
Either want a Benz or a Beamer

[Verse 3]
[Big Boi]
I got these thoughts, similar to the ones in Call of the Wild
Up in the Benz is where I be doin' about a hundred miles
The world is FUCKED UP how these niggas be driving drunk
Vehicular homicide with their bodies off in your trunk
To me the car does not belong, I use that strong arm robbery
Robbin' spree, look at me, W-M-B backwards
Takin' you to the chop shop with these verses
Comin' around the projects make you sleep off in dem hearses
I got a word of wisdom, for those who must resist
You'll be needin' a physical therapist, 'cause you can't fuck with this

[André 3000]
While you sat down by the seashore thinkin' about some seashells
I was around the corner from Pleasant Hill thinkin' about the V-12
But maybe not for long because I just done seen the light
I'm packing my screwdriver so see I'm gon' be alright
Just moving the steering wheel side to side like a slalom
Now I ain't got no problem, I'm just breaking the steering column
I spot him, in the middle of the MARTA parking lot
I'm hearin' a voice in the back of my head yellin "Andre stop!"
But do I stop, naw, I figure it's a come up
But now I'm goin' down 'cause the folks wanna run up
BANG!!!
