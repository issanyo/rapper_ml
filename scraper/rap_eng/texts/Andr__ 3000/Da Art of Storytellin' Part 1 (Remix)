[Verse 1: Big Boi]
Somebody hit me the other day, for a rendezvous
Was it the bitch that fucked the Goodie, and the Dungeon Crew
Let's say her name was Suzy Skrew, ‘cause she screwed a lot
Making a nigga hit that chonk, at legitimate spots
Not no parks, backseats or things of that nature
Had to hate ya player, I'm dicking the ho down never said I paid her
Straight laid her, slayed the bitch like Darth Vader, made her
From College Park and Fayette, all the way down to Decatur
Like Jada, her wig was sharp and sporty, that was shorty
Safe as a snake on eggs in a Beamer 840
It's foggy, I went to the crib to call her but she lost me
My baby mama beeped seven o'clock it's gonna cost me
But I still wanna cut her though, maybe she had to work
I caught her in the mall, wearing a real tight skirt
She was, fine as fuck, I wanted to sex the ho up
She said, "Let's hit the parking lot so I can sick your duck"
I said, "Cool, I really wanted to cut you but this'll do
I gotta pick up my daughter plus my baby mama beeped me too"
She said she understood then everything was kosher
I gave her a Lil' Will CD, and a fuckin poster, it's like that now

[Hook: Sleepy Brown + Big Boi]
It's like that now, you better go on and get the hump up out your back now
It's about four, or five, cats off in my 'Lac now
We just, shoot, game in the form of story raps now
It's like that now, it's like that now

[Verse 2: André 3000]
Now Suzy Skrew had a partner named Sasha, Thumper
I remember her number like the summer
When her and Suzy yeah they threw a slumber
Party but you cannot call it that ‘cause it was slummer
Well it was more like spend the night
Three in the morning yawning dancing under street lights
We chilling like a villain and a nigga feeling right
In the middle of the ghetto on the curb, but in spite
All of the bullshit we on our back staring at the stars above
Talking ‘bout what we gonna be when we grow up
I said what you wanna be, she said, "Alive"
It made me think for a minute, then looked in her eyes
I coulda died, time went on, I got grown
Rhyme got strong, mind got blown, I came back home
To find lil' Sasha was gone
Her mama said she with a nigga that be treating her wrong
I kept on singing my song and hoping at a show
That I would one day see her standing in the front row
But two weeks later she got found in the back of a school
With a needle in her arm, baby two months due, Sasha Thumper

[Hook: Sleepy Brown + Big Boi + Slick Rick]
It's like that now, you better go on and get the hump up out your back now
(Uncle Ricky) Yeah
It's about four, or five, cats off in my 'Lac now
Yeah (Can you tell us a story?)
We just, shoot, game in the form of story raps now
(Please?) Oh
It's like that now, it's like that now
Here we go…

[Verse 3: Slick Rick]
Throwing things, yelling in a mad high pitch
Here we go again with this psychopath bitch
The neighbors will hear you, you misfit
Can't disagree with the bitch without this shit
The price we pay to fuck women
The most pretty bitch got the psycho shit within them
Stuck up, as soon as I pop up
But see me with the next, she wanna tear the fucking club up
Check her pants, a number confirming
Learned more and more, they're just shit to dump sperm in
And you know, probably get cussed if I backslap Miss
While she busy trying to justify who cheated first
"Rick what would I want
With this small chain wearin muh-fucka trying to front?"
I oughta cut her off, let another soothe me
But I don't know, ordinary bitch don't move me
I mean, I tried to fall in love with a bitty
But straight up, just be with the bitch out of pity
So although I know, pretty bitch shady
Here I go, trying to change a hoe into a lady
Knahmean?

[Hook: Sleepy Brown + Big Boi + Slick Rick]
It's like that now, you better go on and get the hump up out your back now
Yeah
It's about four, or five, cats off in my 'Lac now
Yeah
