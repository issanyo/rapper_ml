[Chorus]
Let's kiss, not fight
Try to do what's right tonight
Make love, not war
What the hell are we living for?
Let's kiss, not fight
Try to do what's right tonight
Make love, not war
What the hell are we living for?

[Verse]
Tonight we'll make the prettiest song
That no one will ever hear
No one will ever hear
No one will ever
These ain't the times to be alone
Cliché, the end is near
Cliché, the end is near
Cliché, the end is
Quickly approaching while we carry on
No one is promised another day
Why can't the story end like fairytales often do?
Before I let you leave, I've got to say

[Chorus]
Let's kiss, not fight
Try to do what's right tonight
Make love, not war
What the hell are we living for?
Let's kiss, not fight
Try to do what's right tonight
Make love, not war
What the hell are we living for?

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
Let's kiss, not fight
Try to do what's right tonight
Make love, not war
What the hell are we living for?
Let's kiss, not fight
Try to do what's right tonight
Make love, not war
What the hell are we living for?
Let's kiss, not fight
Try to do what's right tonight
Make love, not war
What the hell are we living for?
Let's kiss, not fight
Try to do what's right tonight
Make love, not war
What the hell are we living for?
