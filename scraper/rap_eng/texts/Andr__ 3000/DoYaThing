[Verse 1: 2D]
I'm a pale imitator of a boy in the sky
With a cap in his head and a knot in his tie
I'm the light in the mall when the power is gone
The shadow in the corner, just playing along
I'm only laying in my bed, I'm rolling aside
But if I get a car, I'm hoping to ride
Because I know if I ever say "I'm leaving" to you
You've gotta volunteer, and you don't know what to do
You're soft

[Chorus: James Murphy]
You wanna do it, but you don't know what you're doin', baby (A-a-a-a-aha)
You wanna feel it but you don't know what you're feeling tonight (Alright, how are we doin'?)
And if you're thinking that I don't know what you're thinking, baby (A-a-a-a-aha)
You do more thinking and I'll go out and make it alright (Alright, how do you do?)

[Verse 2: 2D]
I’m impregnable, incredible, the setting of quo
I’m at Lay Chimirida, not a heart and soul
I got a Saturday night, and nothing is dead
And if I ever had to do it, well, you know I wouldn’t care
I just kicked down, I love when I’m seen
Yeah, and if I wanna talk back, the message is free
Then there’s a fire, a ray, a knot in sight
And if you get popped here, you get ‘em a lot
You get a heart, break

[Chorus: James Murphy]
You wanna do it, but you don't know what you're doin', baby (A-a-a-a-aha)
You wanna feel it but you don't know what you're feeling tonight (Alright, how are we doin'?)
And if you're thinking that I don't know what you're thinking, baby (A-a-a-a-aha)
You do more thinking and I'll go out and make it alright (Alright, how do you do?)

[Post-Chorus: André 3000]
Every time we try, we get nowhere
Wouldn't it be nice if we were just normal people? Yeah
Trying so hard to act like we don't care
But it's true, you do, nothing is left
So I guess I'm right

[Verse 3 : André 3000]
New word, onomatopoeia (Boom)
Quit actin' like you don't wanna be here
Fuck around and get jumped like leap year
Glock in the glove make you really wanna leave me, alone
Get the fuck on, gone
Okay, okay, okay, back to the happy song
Rap ain't nothing but the art of talkin' shit
My girl look pretty up there riding dick
My plaid past, my solid future
Asinine ass and a gorgeous coochie
I'm an OutKast but you're into me
Summer got mad cause the winter blew me
That Juicy Fruit, that splooshy sploosh
Generation X on bloopty bloop
Get duked, gotta get duked, the duke
Everybody hit the floor, we through the roof
Like a chimney, I commend me
How come it be, some lame ass nigga talking about
"Ah, he don't rap enough"
But y'all rap a lot and I'm like "Wrap it up, hoe"
You ain't Scarface, you ain't Willie D
You ain't Bushwick, you ain't killin' me
Better play with your motherfuckin' momma
Bet you still stay with your motherfuckin' momma
Keep sleeping on me, I'ma rock my pajamas
In the daytime, I swear, I promise
Dare a nigga say something, tear a nigga face off
How come Blacks don't play baseball?
Y'all white, know y'all can taste all this
Fly shit, I stay finna take off

[Refrain: André 3000]
Do Ya damn Thing, Do Ya Thing-a-Thing
Do Ya damn Thing, Do Ya Thing-a-Thing
Do Ya damn Thing, Do Ya Thing-a-Thing
You ain't fresh squeezed juice, nigga, you that Tang
Do Ya damn Thing, Do Ya Thing-a-Thing
Do Ya damn Thing, Do Ya Thing-a-Thing
Do Ya damn Thing, Do Ya Thing-a-Thing
Wait, is you really Slick Rick? Nope, you Dana Dane

[Verse 4: André 3000]
Bet it up, head erupts
A lava language in a vocal volcanic
If it ain't fixed, don't broke it, don't panic
If it ain't this, it ain't shit, goddamn it
If it ain't this, it ain't dope, it don't flush
And if it ain't hip, it don't hop, well then hush
Man, they sound like, man, they stole your
Man, they look like—nope, it ain't us

[Refrain: André 3000]
Do Ya damn Thing, Do Ya Thing-a-Thing
Do Ya damn Thing, Do Ya Thing-a-Thing
Do Ya damn Thing, Do Ya Thing-a-Thing
Wait, is you really Slick Rick? Nope, you Dana Dane
Do Ya damn Thing, Do Ya Thing-a-Thing
Do Ya damn Thing, Do Ya Thing-a-Thing
Do Ya damn Thing, Do Ya Thing-a-Thing
You ain't fresh squeezed juice, nigga, you that Tang

[Post-Chorus: André 3000]
Every time we try, we get nowhere
Wouldn't it be nice if we were just normal people? Yeah
Trying so hard to act like we don't care (I don't care)
But it's true, you do, nothing is left
So I guess I'm right

[Outro: André 3000]
Flip the page, our days are revelatious
Space is strange, doctor, I've got no patience
Oh, it's all a part of the process (Okay, okay)
Nothing's new, it's true, cool, I admit
Shit, I guess you're right
