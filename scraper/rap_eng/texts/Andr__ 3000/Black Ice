Do you ever see that stuff that be
When it get cold that ice that you can't see?
See that shit happens sometimes
Yep, black ice

[Verse 1: Gipp]
Now you know and I know
I done bumped every hole in the wall, y'all
Did you catch that phone call?
Most of y'all that met me thought I was tall
Gipp flipped like a dip, slipped, fell on the black ice
Did you think twice? Homeslice came and he went
Satisfied, got bent, bars ain't shit
Meetin' coast to coast, yeah, I laughed and boast
Man do-si-dos, too many comin' close to

[Hook]
Touch what I never touched befo', seen what I never seen befo'
Woke up and seen the sun sky high, sky high

[Verse 2]
Circulate like a Sunday paper
Capers caught long time, to cheap flicks, good picks
Paid hard, watch the hard turn sideways
Pick the tale for real sales to those who lose cash
Players keep your life for now
Feeling good and warm, windows rolled tight
Thirty-five degrees, nippy tonight
Don't forget the ChapStick, lips dry quick
When the jack out, make you wanna act out
Take the slack out, some people black out
Hibernatin' 'til we came back out

[Hook]
Touch what I never touched befo', seen what I never seen befo'
Woke up and seen the sun sky high, sky high (Sky high)
Touch what I never touched befo', seen what I never seen befo'
Woke up and seen the sun sky high, sky high

[Verse 3]
I been in it for the past few days
Tighter than fades, I'm knowin' my plays
Now can I rap? Can I adapt? Not really sure yet
Who that lookin' over the shoulders of those writin' dreams?
Fiendin' for the taste of menthol
Missed class, stayed in the hall
Lookin' for a squeeze play, better yet a holiday
Stayed away from the pyramid board game
Broke it down to a neighborhood slang
Cash before fame

Sky high (Repeat 10X)

[Verse 4: Big Boi]
Now who done stepped in?
The nigga the B-I-G, the secret weapon, Boi
Slicker than Black Ice, throwin' these flows like rice at weddings
So quit flexing, we speakin' about
Somethin' that's refreshing to the earlobes
Pay for the room and still be in pimp mode
Like Iceberg, Chryslers and Buicks
Some niggas ain't on they jobs so them suckers here to lose it
Abuse they privileges and now the whole villages been shot to pieces
'Cause niggas are biting that same stupid shit, I mean that feces
Boy, don't beep me, if you ain't got no work
I'm strictly 'bout these verses like the ones you hear at church, boy, search, boy
Talkin' about your dough is long like Lurch, boy
Every time I heard you rhymin' like a fucking jerk, boy; simp
Yeah!

[Verse 5: Andre Benjamin]
Friends, Romans, countrymen, lend me your eardrums
It was a beautiful day off in the neighborhood
Yellows and greens and blues and browns
And greys and hues that ooze beneath dilapidated wood
Ain't a thing could explain what pertains
To cocaine and sustaining reign
See summer rolls around, niggas holla bout change
Then they steady move them ki's like Bob James
'Cause old man winter's arrived, the temperature dives
November just died, December's alive
Thus it ain't no typical ride
Just individual's way to bring home
The bacon when bacon was all gone
Makin' it our own, takin' me all wrong
We've all indulged in the bulge of those no-no's
No, you ain't solo, there's even lower levels you can go
Take sun people, put 'em in a land of snow

[Hook]
Touch what I never touched befo', seen what I never seen befo'
Woke up and seen the sun sky high, sky high
