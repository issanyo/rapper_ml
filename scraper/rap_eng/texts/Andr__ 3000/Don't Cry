[Verse 1]
Take just one look around me
Tell me what you see
Your reflection and a brokenhearted memory
I tried so hard to do the best I could
You lied and now we've got to get this understood

[Chorus]
Don't cry, don't call me
I don't want you around me
Who are you to judge me?
I'm only what you made me

[Verse 2]
You should have took advantage
Of every waking moment
But you thought you had time to waste
And you were so dead wrong, mmm-hmm
I tried so hard to do the best I could
You lied and now we've got to get this understood

[Chorus]
Don't cry, don't call me
I don't want you around me
Who are you to judge me?
I'm only what you made me
Don't cry, don't call me
I don't want you around me
Who are you to judge me?
I'm only what you made me

[Bridge]
I don't wanna see your tears
I don't wanna hear your voice
Don't you know you made the choice
Boy, you did me so wrong

[Chorus]
Don't cry, don't call me
I don't want you around me
Who are you to judge me?
I'm only what you made me
Don't cry, don't call me
I don't want you around me
Who are you to judge me?
I'm only what you made me

[Outro]
And a brokenhearted memory
Don't wanna see you, don't wanna hear you
You did me wrong, leave me alone
Baby, I tried so hard to do the best I could
But you lied and now we've got to get this understood
Don't even think about calling me
'Cause I don't wanna...
