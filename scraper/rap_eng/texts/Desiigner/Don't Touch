[Intro]
[?]

[Chorus 1]
12 tried to lock me up but a nigga beat the case
Tried to put the drugs on me, guns on me, I speed away
I done jumped out, i8
Two cars, made nigga, see the Wraith?
TMZ tell my mommy, daddy
Tried to lock me up, put me in the cage
Got that Ruger on me, a .45 in the cooler on me
Steroids and a few homies
Everybody tried to back out
Everybody had toolas on me
Everybody see a young nigga gettin' money
So niggas pulled it on me
Everybody tryna get a live brick
Everybody fuck with the phony

[Verse 1]
Ayy, I fuck around, pop shit
Don't touch, I'll pop shit
Shout out to the G.O.O.D. Music
Kanye 'cause I got rich
Two Bimmers, got a couple bitches and a couple lobby
See me pull up with a couple bad bitches
Everybody poppin'
Couple of heaters on me
Finna pull up with them speakers on me
You talkin' up and get heated, homie
Fuck around, 'round, gon' get it
From the trip, nigga know you with it
From the trip, nigga know I did it
On the 40 deuce with a couple bitches
In the Uber truck, ain't nobody snitchin', ayy, ayy

[Chorus 2]
12 tried to lock me up, but a nigga beat the case
Tried to put the drugs on me, guns on me
Everybody tried to beat the Wraith
Halloween, bugged out, thugged out
Everybody tried to be a snake
Cops told me that's my gun, my gun
Everybody in the Wraith, that's my whip

[Refrain]
Don't touch, that's my shit
Don't touch, that's my shit
Don't touch, that's my shit
Don't touch, that's my shit
Cop told me that's my drug, that's my gun, that's my shit
Don't touch, that's my shit
Don't touch, that's my shit
Don't touch, that's my shit
Don't touch, that's my brick
Don't touch, that's my bitch
Don't touch, that's my [?]
Don't touch, that's [?]
Don't touch, that's [?]
Don't touch, that's [?]

[Verse 2]
4, 5, that's my shit
I get that [?] shit
Do that, clout shit
You get, I get
(You wasn't even there when they locked me up)
You touched, my bitch
Don't touch, my bitch
I'ma ride around with a Glock 40' and if them niggas come around, pop shit
Got young niggas and they ridin' beams
Everybody ride 'round to see
[?]
Don't touch, that's my shit

[Refrain]
Don't touch, that's my shit
Don't touch, that's my shit
Don't touch, that's my shit
Don't touch, that's my shit
