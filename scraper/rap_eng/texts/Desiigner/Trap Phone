[Intro: Don Q]
Yeah
Don
Put the suit back on all you niggas

[Verse 1: Don Q]
Look what I overcame
They slaughtered my name and they tarnished it
I just came up on a open lane
They say I'm the one who gon' conquer it
You wasn't there when we started it
Now you wanna come be a part of it
Nigga, we ain't under nobody
We came in Atlantic for partnership
I know my mom she pray for me
First in the morning and every night faithfully
I see the game had a vacancy
I'm tyna boss up and start up an agency
I'm happy God made a way for me right at the top with the greats where they play for me
I know these niggas got thoughts of betraying me
Keep them outsiders away from me
Can't have no strangers around us
I got too famous for lounges
I'm too impatient for browsing, I want it I'm bringing it straight to the counter
I'm way too busy to do it, I pay an accountant to pay my accountant
I got too lazy to count it
Look at my chain it's astounding

[Chorus: Desiigner]
I got a phone, it's a trap phone
I get your girl give me back bone
I get some bitches on that phone, I get some riches on that phone
Y'all do some snitchin' on that phone
I put some 6's in that chrome
I put some 6's in that dome
I put some 6's in that home

[Verse 2: Desiigner]
I give my dogs the medicine
I call my dogs, they veterans
I give my dog the weapon, then
Just hit my dog, they send them in
Aimbot, aimbot, first I whack him, then I whack a cop
Paid 380 for the top
Then put .380's in your top
And then to 80 on your block
And now it's navy on the block
And now you gravy on the block
Be lookin' wavy on your block
L.O.D, Highbridge
So much shit that we did
Had to shout out the gang
Did it all for the fame

[Chorus: Desiigner]
I got a phone, it's a trap phone
I get your girl give me back bone
I get some bitches on that phone, I get some riches on that phone
Y'all do some snitchin' on that phone
I put some 6's in that chrome
I put some 6's in that dome
I put some 6's in that home

[Verse 3: Don Q]
Look at this shit I'm inspiring, I'm a nigga they admiring
I get in the lab and I turn into a scientist, got 'em thinkin' 'bout retirement
I got some hoes out the country and I got a bunch of them flying in
I'm a product of my environment
I get some product and flood the environment
They watchin' the ice when I step at the light
I drop a tint when I left the toll
Gold Lex and my neck is froze
It got gold sets and I'm settin' goals
My legacy gon' be set in stone
I know some niggas that's never home, but they do dirt and never tell a soul
He goin' back to the trap when he left parole
Yeah, yeah!

[Chorus: Desiigner]
I got a phone, it's a trap phone
I get your girl give me back bone
I get some bitches on that phone, I get some riches on that phone
Y'all do some snitchin' on that phone
I put some 6's in that chrome
I put some 6's in that dome
I put some 6's in that home

[Outro: Desiigner]
For the fame
We've been all through the pain
And the rain
Same
Now congratulations and pop champagne
