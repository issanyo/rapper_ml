[Verse: Mekado]
Uh, that's that new Beamer
Killed the game for more than two seasons
For two reasons
Was a little dirty nigga, now I'm eatin'
I be workin' so hard, this shit got me bleedin'
She in love with the D, she tell me she need it
Was searchin' for a minute, finders keepers
Now I got the blink in my new Beamer
Got these divas in my two seater
Put some chaser in my two liter
I've been buggin' for a lot of reasons
Like fuck what I want, I got what I needed
Lot of niggas plottin', they ain't never seen it
They sneak dissin' but they never mean it
On they diss record and I never seen it
Then they throwin' shots and you never meet 'em
Woo! But when you see him
He ain't got it then you gotta clean him
He ain't got it then he got it and you beam him
I'ma hop out of that new Beamer
All of this bullshit, it got me heated
Treat him like Michael, I make him beat it
You gettin' money then you might get it
Give him that fire, I'll make him need it
Went there with a nigga, I had to leave him
Ride for my nigga, my brother's keeper
All them hatin' niggas, yeah you know I peep 'em
When you gettin' money then you never leave 'em
Fuck with my dog, man I gotta feed him
He ain't right and he right, I never leave him
He ain't eatin' then I'm eatin' then he eatin'
Always on my shit, I'm never sleepin'
All these lil' bitches always creepin'
Never saw her again, that's just for the weekend
Had that bitch singin' like she The Weeknd
Ever since then we stopped speakin'
Since she seen me hop out that new Beamer
Now she wanna hop in that new Beamer
Then I kicked the bitch out the fuckin' Beamer
Now she mad 'cause she know I don't need her

[Bridge: Desiigner]
Ayy, new Beamer (whiplash!)
New Beamer
New Beamer (whiplash!)
New Beamer
I got that new Beamer (whiplash!)
I got that two liter
I got the tool with me (whiplash!)
Tote that toolie
Ayy, put the moves in
Jackie Chan, put the moves in
Put a four in
New Beamer
Two liter
Cruel leader
New Beamer
New Beamer

[Outro: Desiigner]
Doin' it
Y'all don't want it
Y'all don't want it
Want it
New Beamer
That's that new Beamer
That is that, that is that new Beamer
That's that new Beamer
I'm out here rhymin' like two heaters
I never believe her
You be talkin' that money then it do it
New Beamer
New Beamer
