[Intro: Desiigner]
HitMakerDot
Taylor on the beat
Git, git, brrra

[Chorus: Desiigner]
First, you get that bag, huh
Then you get that bitch, huh
Money come with hoes, huh
Hoes, they always switch, huh
I go get that money, get that money, gettin' rich, huh
I can't trust these hoes, trust these hoes, they always switch
I got a chopper that come with a stick, huh
You try to run up, get hit
I am the boss and I feel like Montana, huh
I make your bitch buy a brick
I know it's money before them hoes, huh
I hope you never forget
I love the money, it bringing the hoes, huh
She have more fun when you rich

[Verse 1: Desiigner]
She have more fun when you rich, huh
She do more things when you rich, huh
Do everything with the rich, huh
But when you go broke she will switch
When you go broke, she will switch
This why I don't trust no bitch
I'd rather fuck then get rich
Get money, drip from my six
Plus, niggas, they'll hate on you
So you gotta rock with it
Some don't rock with it
So they get it how you give it
You know where we come from
You got to boss up, huh
Or you gonna have a boss
Or the choppas, they'll get you lost

[Chorus: Desiigner]
First, you get that bag, huh
Then you get that bitch, huh
Money come with hoes, huh
Hoes, they always switch, huh
I go get that money, get that money, gettin' rich, huh
I can't trust these hoes, trust these hoes, they always switch
I got a chopper that come with a stick, huh
You try to run up, get hit
I am the boss and I feel like Montana, huh
I make your bitch buy a brick
I know it's money before them hoes, huh
I hope you never forget
I love the money, it bringing the hoes, huh
She have more fun when you rich
First, you get that bag, huh
Then you get that bitch, huh
Money come with hoes, huh
Hoes, they always switch, huh
I go get that money, get that money, gettin' rich, huh
I can't trust these hoes, trust these hoes, they always switch
I got a chopper that come with a stick, huh
You try to run up, get hit
I am the boss and I feel like Montana, huh
I make your bitch buy a brick
I know it's money before them hoes, huh
I hope you never forget
I love the money, it bringing the hoes, huh
She have more fun when you rich

[Verse 2: Dave East]
Started broke, then we got rich
This Glock 40 came with a beamer
Had 20k on me, they raided my shit
I've been throwing up 30's the first day you seen me
I woke up and went to Prada
I called up Desiigner, my neck and wrist freezing
I got the drop on them niggas that plotted
Whenever we catch them, that's where we gon' leave 'em
Stack all the fifty's and hunnid's, the ten's and the twenty's, I get them, [?]
I jump out the whip, take a pic with my gun
I got so much to pitch, I can't leave till it's done
I bought a brand new 600
I hired a driver so I can get blunted
Go have your baby momma found in the trunk, that's some foreign shit
Talk 'bout that life, you don't want it
I'm kickin' shit, like I'm puntinâ€™
She thought I was cute, I put dick in her stomach
Dick in her mouth, then I went on the 'gram and I liked a picture of her kissin' her husband
[?], I'm dippin' and runnin'
Flippin and tumblin, that's just the push of a button
Take care of my kid and my cousins
End of discussion, I'm not tryna get rich for nothin'

[Chorus: Desiigner]
First, you get that bag, huh
Then you get that bitch, huh
Money come with hoes, huh
Hoes, they always switch, huh
I go get that money, get that money, gettin' rich, huh
I can't trust these hoes, trust these hoes, they always switch
I got a chopper that come with a stick, huh
You try to run up, get hit
I am the boss and I feel like Montana, huh
I make your bitch buy a brick
I know it's money before them hoes, huh
I hope you never forget
I love the money, it bringing the hoes, huh
She have more fun when you rich
