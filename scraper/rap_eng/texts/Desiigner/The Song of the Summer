[Intro: Logan Paul]
Hey yo, if you want to get the girl of your dreams
It's not about the diamonds or the pearls
Or the fancy cars, or about the business class tickets to the Maldives
You just need to get your famous friends to sing on a track with you

[Verse 1: Logan Paul]
Pretty little thing, you're the one I love
Whenever we kiss it's like a sea of doves
Let's dance all night to the break of dawn then wake up naked on a sticky lawn
We could chill at the crib, don't matter to me
Baby, I could eat you up like a calorie
That summer love that we have found
This fire in my pants just won't go down, I need you

[Pre-Chorus 1]
This love ain't never going to fade
My trunk is full of Mary Jane
In your arms is where I want to stay
So jump in my daddy's Ford Escape

[Chorus]
You got me feeling like I slipped and fell in love
The sun is shining so the summer's just begun
You got me feeling like it must be summer love
Must be summer love
Must be summer love
You're all I, I want and that's enough
You got me feeling like it must be summer love
Must be summer love
Must be summer love
(This is the song of the summer)

[Breakdown]

[Post-Chorus 1: Desiigner & Logan Paul]
Hey true
Ayy, ayy, ayy stay true
Hey true
Yo, get ready for this

[Verse 2: Desiigner & (Logan Paul)]
I got a little secret, I'ma tell you about it (oh shit!)
I did it over summer, I'ma tell you I got this (that's my boy Desiigner)
I'm goin' to the top, I'm on my way to the mountain (with two "I"'s though!)
We do this every summer
We do this as we take your girl (wait, what?)
Yeah I got her (got her what?)
Hold on, yeah I got this
Havin' sex look like a moshpit
Driving fast, can't stop shit
In Dubai with the pandas
Trip to Atlanta, sippin' on the 30 pound
Party hard, chilling with the scammers
(This is not cool man)

[Pre-Chorus 2: (Logan Paul)]
This love ain't never going to fade (what just happened?)
Tonight, Desiigner brought his game (uh, okay)
In your arms is where I want to stay (okay!)
Sure he's hot, but what the fuck did he just say?

[Chorus]
You got me feeling like I slipped and fell in love
The sun is shining so the summer's just begun
You got me feeling like it must be summer love
Must be summer love
Must be summer love
You're all I, I want and that's enough
You got me feeling like it must be summer love
Must be summer love
Must be summer love
(This is the song of the summer)

[Breakdown]

[Post-Chorus 2: Desiigner & Logan Paul]
Hey true
Ayy, ayy, ayy stay true
Hey true
Hey, don't worry guys
Everything's gonna be okay
'Cause here comes the second guest on my track!

[Verse 3: David Hasselhoff & (Logan Paul)]
Forget this guy babe, you need a real man (are you kidding me?)
Have tantric sex while Sting plays "Roxanne" (Dave what are you doing?)
Take you to space with Richard Branson
Give you diamonds and pearls
Take you to another world
That means sex

[Interlude: Logan Paul, (David Hasselhoff) & Desiigner]
Well, uh, looks like I was totally wrong guys
If you want to get a girl don't ever, ever, ever let her hang out with your famous friends
(You've been hoffed pal)
I guess you really need diamonds and pearls and a spaceship
Or something
Diamonds and pearls with a squirrel
Damn it man, I blew it

[Pre-Hook 3: (Logan Paul)]
These boys got nothing on you babe (you're back?)
Fuck them and their fake ass cheap gold chains (take that Desiigner)
'Cause this love might just get you laid (and fuck you Hassehoff)
So drink up 'till we forget our names

[Chorus]
You got me feeling like I slipped and fell in love
The sun is shining so the summer's just begun
You got me feeling like it must be summer love
Must be summer love
Must be summer love
You're all I, I want and that's enough
You got me feeling like it must be summer love
Must be summer love
Must be summer love
(To Hoffinity, and beyond!)

[Breakdown]

[Outro: David Hasselhoff]
I'm going for a cup of Hoffee
