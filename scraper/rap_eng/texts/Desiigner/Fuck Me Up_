[Intro]
[?]

[Chorus]
Roll it up, slow it up
Pour me up, fuck me up
Ice me up, turn me up
Timmy, Timmy, Timmy Turner, burn it up
She wanna suck me up, she wanna love me up
She wanna turn me up, she wanna fuck me up
I'm on a double cup, and I'm burnin' up
She got a double cup, and she turnin' up

[Verse]
I always keep a bad girl, yeah, I keep her next to me
I just wanna know if she is tryna get a piece of me
I never [?]
You know that I do not fuck with niggas if they frenemies
Zonin', ownin', I just like ballin'
Ownin', fuckin', she just like fuckin'
Horny, horny, she said that I'm horny
She said I can't eat it anywhere a nigga want it
Honest, I just gotta keep it one-hunnid'
Runnin', she's dishonest, this is boring
Money, I'm just countin' all hunnids'
Money, I'm just countin' all hunnids'

[Chorus]
Roll it up, slow it up
Pour me up, fuck me up
Ice me up, turn me up
Timmy, Timmy, Timmy Turner, burn it up
She wanna suck me up, she wanna love me up
She wanna turn me up, she wanna fuck me up
I'm on a double cup, and I'm burnin' up
She got a double cup, and she turnin' up
