I'm with the gang up in Malibu (Yeah)
Don't let my niggas embarrass you

My niggas, they comin' with parachutes
We jump off the jet with the parachutes
She poppin' the Xannnies, the edible
I got my gang up in Malibu
I have my niggas come challenge you

[Verse 1]
That nigga drive through with them Challengers
Jump out the window with calibers
I got your bitch in Miami, bruh (Hey)
I got her swallowin' Xannies, bruh

Niggas they talk and I smack 'em
Let the geographists map 'em
Then we run up and we clap 'em (Hey)
In the Bentley, I got mad room (Yeah)
And my driver, he a baboon
Bad bitch with Chanel on (Hey)
Next to me with her head down
Watch me hit her with the fast moves
Watch me hit her with the mack moves
Now we gettin' in the bathroom

Gettin' head in the bathroom
Gettin' sex in the bathroom
Special Ed. like the classroom
We that, we shred
He that, read that
He dead, we clap
You talk, we crack
She trap, she trap
Need that, need pack
She got pounds, hundred bricks
If a nigga need that

DJ turnin' up the volume
Made a song called "Slap A Nigga"
Then I put it on the iTunes
Then I put it on my iTunes
Then I put it on my myTunes
You be lookin' for it, find tunes
You be tryna go to find tunes
*How I get it on the iTunes

I be chillin' with the right goons
And they chillin' with the rice spoons

[Chorus]
I'm with the gang up in Malibu
Don't let my niggas embarrass you
Don't let my dogs embarrass you
My niggas, they comin' with parachutes
We jump off the jet with the parachutes
She poppin' the Xannies, the edibles
I got my gang up in Malibu
I have my niggas come challenge you
I'm with the gang up in Malibu
Don't let my niggas embarrass you
Don't let my dogs embarrass you
My niggas, they comin' with parachutes
We jump off the jet with the parachutes
She poppin' the Xannies, the edibles
