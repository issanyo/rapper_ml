Car crash, call it racin' out
The bullet kiss 'em, call it makin' out
They never said I'd appose to nothin'
Choppa known for thumpin'
Make a nigga start Forrest Gumpin'
When I catch that boy forest frontin'
Choppa blow his stomach
Hit his body and his soul be jumpin'
Cause my nigga don't blow for nothin'
We gon' run up on you, we gon' get you hit
Talk a lot like you servin' brick
Tryna get me rich and I fuck your bitch
She be suckin' dick on some other shit
These niggas, they just tryna hate on me
Take me out try to put date on me
Gotta ride 'round with that thang on me
Catch a nine slippin' by 43, word to me
I'ma just keep goin' hard 'til it's dirt on me
L Block 390, you heard of me?
Chopper rips open like surgery
I'm back from the dead, close the curtain, B
All my niggas they get away
Everybody gon' get away
Shot em dead, Yesterday
Everybody gonna pick away
(?) Zombie walk, Everybody getting Zombie chalked
I be coming through you, Zombie night
Swept niggas in the Zombie park
I be killing with them couple killers
With them killer talking then we gotta talk
We be coming with a couple choppers and them
Killers talking then we gotta talk
Chopper, Chopper, Chopper gotta talk
Everybody gon get away
Drive round' then get away
Cops come we get away
Pull up (inaudible)
Then I sit away, Sit back and I read on it
