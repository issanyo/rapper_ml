[Verse 1: GoldLink]
Yeah, we gotta bring it back for Ye
We have to pray, besides what the pastor say
I have to say, since Steez passed away
Most these rappers don't even deserve a track from me
Got me on these old women, Uncle Phil with it
I ain't ever trill with it, always keep it real with it
I ain't ever, look, I ain't ever back from a fight
I ain't ever had to answer, tell 'em back from a nigga, uh
Illy-illy, she gon' celebrate her wins
Papa drive a cab, but graduated to a Benz
If it's up to me, I'll put a whole lot of somethin'
Tell her open up the oven and she poppin' up with twins, yeah
Never gave a fuck, niggas wanna gimme guff
Pop a molly 'cause they don't think that I sweat enough
On some hella shit, need to get some better wins
Need some better bitches, ooh, she better bring her better friends

[Chorus: Desiigner]
DJ play it loud in the speakers
Got it droppin', two speakers
DJ play it loud in the speakers
You get dropped, I get dropped by two eaters
DJ play it loud in the speakers
Got it droppin', two speakers
DJ play it loud in the speakers
You get dropped, I get dropped by two eaters

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 2: Goldlink]
Yeah, I go in it where the kitty go
My ol' girl though, she the greatest, that's historical
I love the bass so much I gotta do the encore
These boys game, we did prolly use a glory 'fore, the story goes
He that nigga everybody know
But they never tell him, 'cause they know he know
I ain't trippin' though
Actin' like I hit the medical
I'm off the same shit Travis got his antidote
Uh, it's night time and the night young
That Mardi gettin' loud, I'm always spin the right ones
Yeah, feelin' geechi on my pipe
When the shorty suckin' crazy so I call her mouth Dyson
Yeah, you ain't get it, you should run it back
Play it back and back, it look like you my runnin' back
Yeah, if there's a throne it's mine now
I ain't even really grabbin' but I might now

[Chorus: Desiigner]
DJ play it loud in the speakers
Got it droppin', two speakers
DJ play it loud in the speakers
You get dropped, I get dropped by two eaters
DJ play it loud in the speakers
Got it droppin', two speakers
DJ play it loud in the speakers
You get dropped, I get dropped by two eaters

[Outro: Desiigner]
Loud in the speak-
Lou-loud in the speaker
Loud in the speak-
Lou-loud in the speaker
Loud in the speak-
Lou-loud in the speaker
