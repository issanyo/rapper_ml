Hook/Chorus:
All of them killers won’t make it out
Car crash, call it, racing out
All of them killers won’t make it out
Car crash, call it, racing out
Got a big brick, trying build a house
Tryna run my Mercedes out
Big grams in the granny couch
All of them killers won’t make it out
I said all of them killers won’t make it out
Car crash, call it, racing out
All of them killers won’t make it out
The car crash, call it, racing out
Got a big brick, tryna build a house
Tryna run my Mercedes out
Big grams in the granny couch
All of them killers won’t make it out
I said all of the killers won’t make it out
Car crash, call it, racing out
All of them killers won’t make it out
Car crash, call it, racing out
Got a big brick, tryna build a house
Tryna run my Mercedes out
Big grams in the granny couch
All of them killers won’t make it out
I said all of the killers won’t make it out
Car crash, call it, racing out
All of them killers won’t make it out
The car crash, call it, racing out
Got a big brick, tryna build a house
Tryna run my Mercedes out
Big grams in the granny couch
All of them killers won’t make it out

Desiigner verse:
All of them killers won’t make it out
The car crash, call it racing out
The bullet kissing call it making out
They never said it out, opposed or nothing
Chopper known for dumping, make a nigga start Forrest Gumping
When I catch that boy forest fronting
Chopper blow stomach so his body is always jumping
Cause my niggas don’t pull for nothing
We gone run up on you, we gone get you wet
Toke a lot like you serving brick
Tryna get me rich and I fuck your bitch
And she suck a dick on some other shit
These niggas, think they’re tryna hate on me
Take me, they try to put weight on me
Gotta ride ’round with that thing on me
Catch ’em out slipping, ’bout 43, word to me
I’ma just keep it all, throwing dirt on me
How about the 90, you heard of me?
Chopper rips open like surgery
I’m back from the dead, close the curtain spree
All my killers gone get away
Savage come through, he gone get away
Mikey come through, he gone rip it fast
Everybody gone ripping face
And I’m a killer
Feeling like I’m Scottie Pippen, woo!
You heard that Gotti engine, woo!
You heard I’m karate flipping, woo!
Now haters, they ought to mention
Cut through the diamond, bih
I got guns and they’re shooting like Tony Flipping
Codeine, you know I sip it
Y’all niggas ought to mention

(Chorus/Hook)

R3alt4lk verse:
I said all of them killers won't make it out
Hundred bands when I take the shots and I roll up on your block
You know that I got the Glock extended clips you messing with my gang
Hundred bands man I go insane
Run up on you and you won't see the pain
Cause everybody known how i did it lil man
And I go insane when I pull the Glock out
Pussy ass nigga why you talking?
Gotta hundred bands in my mother fucking pocket and you know when I see you you ain't walking
Body on the ground and you know that we flipping
And we grabbing on that tech and you know that we sipping
And you really wanna play with my name when I run up on you and I smash your brain
Double fmg cause you know I got it
Hundred bands and you think you bout it
Ima run up on you ima drop them windows
Cause you know you ain't got it
Man im straight up out of Philly i lost 2 of my niggas to gun violence
But they really won't make it out cause i know you ain't even trying
I know you ain't got no shots
Man you ain't got no Glock
I don't even see you pulling out so you won't ever hit no shots
Man its R3AL man
And you won't make it out
Man I'm only 17 got 500k inside my bank account
So all of them killers won't make it out

(Chorus/Hook)
