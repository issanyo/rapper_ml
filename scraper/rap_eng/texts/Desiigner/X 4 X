I got a bitch in Miami
She goin' hard for the 'gram
I put the dick in her panty
She working hard for the family
I got them niggas, that's working
Jump on them niggas whose planning
I got a bitch in Miami
We goin' Xanny for Xanny
We goin' Xanny for Xanny
She start to pull off her panty
I start to pull out the jammy
We goin' blammy for blammy
You shot, you get robbed, or you hit
Knock 'em all off with a stick
Kill 'em all 'cause they snitched
I got a bitch in Miami
I got her pulling her panty
I got my dick in the jammy
I got a Xanny for a Xanny
I'm goin' Xanny for Xanny
You shot, you get robbed or you hit

Kill 'em off then I dip

These niggas snakes in the grass

No flake, no last
Gang, gang or die

Line of the smoke in my hair
See an opp, shoot him dead first
Stripper section, nigga, lot of cash
So she go grab the meds first
So she go grab the meds first
Then I go grab the bed first
Said she do it big for her family
R.I.P. to the dead homies
R.I.P. to the dead homies
Now I'm drippin' with the feds on me
Hair drippin', deads on me
Hair swingin', sippin' meds on 'em
Now different colors of the cola
Have some burnt niggas in the closet
Sippin' lean, and I can't stop it
Go hard nigga, no title
Nobody in this buildin' fuck with me
Niggas, niggas, know I got it
Pull up, blast the heat
Talkin' like you 'bout it, 'bout it
I blast the heat, talkin' like Master P
