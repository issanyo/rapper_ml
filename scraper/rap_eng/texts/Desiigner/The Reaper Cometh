[Verse: Desiigner]
I got skies like the weatherman, uh
I crack cars, get hella bands, uh
I got girl from the motherland, uh
I got shooters, went Taliban
I get it, get it, anyway, uh
Blue-look script in the hurricane, uh
I crack cars could everyday uh
I get money up every day, uh (skrr skrr)
Grrraa
Grrraa
