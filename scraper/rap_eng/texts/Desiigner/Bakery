[Hook: Desiigner]
I made this kitchen wood like a Bakery
Thank you Lord, just for thanking me
Niggas they try to hate on me
Take me out, try to put date on me
So I ride with that thing on me
Bang on you if you bang on me
Lord will forgive me, just wait on me
Lord will forgive me, just wait on me
I made this kitchen wood like a Bakery
Thank you Lord, just for thanking me
Niggas they try to hate on me
Take me out, try to put  date on me
So I ride with that thing on me
Bang on you if you bang on me
Lord will forgive me, just wait on me
Lord will forgive me, just wait on me
I made this kitchen wood like a Bakery
Thank you lord, just for thanking me
Niggas they try to hate on me
Take me out, try to put date on me
So I ride with that thing on me
Bang on you if you bang on me
Lord will forgive me, just wait on me
Lord will forgive me, just wait on me

[Verse: King Savage]
I cook up the wood like a Bakery
King Savage from L.O.D
I think nobody could fuck with me
With chopper and knock out your artery
Hold the pleads, please watch over me
I forever flexin' so they hate on me
I wake up in the morning, she put brain on me
She put brain on me
I don't trust no fuck niggas
Like the Indian's, you get slumped niggas
By the muzzles nigga
Leave your body in the dump with it
Don't fuck with it
When I touch a mil, have fun with it
But I'm too thin, grind and get it
Middle fingers up to my competition
I'm on a mission so I'm sneak dissin'
Hate on me cause a nigga different
Nice whips, I got some foreign bitches
Smokin' gas without a hit
Then this bitch got me thinkin'
About all the niggas that she fuckin' with
They ain't getting money so fuck the bitch
She could suck my dick on some other shit
And I'm L.O.D. gonna be hella rich
I cook up this wood like a bakery
Turn the 10 ounces the thing on me
Fuck nigga tryin' put date on me
Right around town with that thing on me
Bang on you, bang on me
Pussy's can't hang with me
Thank you lord for forgiving me
Thank you lord for forgiving me
They ride around town tryin' put date on me
They ride around town tryin' put date on me
