Bitch tryna get me confused, haters they want me to lose
Might just pull up in the Rari, have bitches bitin' my jewels
In the city like Bruce Wayne, fighters kickin' like Liu Kang
Love the smoke, but the crew drank
Doors suicide on Mulsanne
Bag your bitches like two frames
Bag your bitch wit' her new friends
Sixty five for the new chain
Got me feelin' like Bruce Wayne
Hold on I'm feelin myself, hey
She poppin pills for her health, hey
I got them drugs on the shelf
I got them M's by myself, hey

[Verse 1: Desiigner]
Forty bottles, fifty bitches, and forty mil' got this shit poppin'
We in the spot that shits poppin'
Bruce Wayne, Bruce Wayne, new thang, new thang'
I don't know nothin' but when you from the slums you will never make it back
Yeah I made it and I'm back
Niggas ride for a stack, niggas ride for a pack
Got a bitch ass fat, fashion show with Chanel on
Like a bitch with her hair done
In my i8 hair blowin'
Play chess niggas they're pawns
Yeah my whole gang got drums
Rallin' up with the gang, huh
First I'm talkin now I'm blamin' yeah
I'm get it nigga steady rip a nigga til' a nigga understand it, huh
Sip the dirty, they ain't sippin dirty, you ain't sippin on a different planet
Now I'm fallin now I'm landin', huh, now I'm landin' on the granite

[Verse 2: Thouxanbanfauni]
Came in like Heath Ledger wit' my stainless steel no boolin
These niggas be foolin', my baby be toolin'
These niggas don't understand no snoorin' can't be snoozin'
If you wan' come in first then why the fuck you be losing
Why the fuck you be spinnin, on vroom vroom no cruisin'
These niggas don't understand that .45 misuse it
That .45 abuse it, my whole team abuse it
And these niggas don't know that we come through no snoozin'
She just wan' get in the hoop, she wan' be looped in
This money like a time loop I'm always lootin'
My nigga gon' shoot and that's just how he shoot and
And he shoot left hand, and that's just how he hoop it
These nigga don't understand we get it how we get it
Straight out the mud baby that 3400 trenches
Ballin' like a monther fucker, not ballin' on no benches
These niggas be stingy, I can't be stingy
