[Intro]
Whoa, whoa, yeah
Street, slums
Vador

[Chorus]
Oh, watching that overnight, overnight, overnight, overnight, overnight
I'm in the club with some real niggas
Sadness around me, how many niggas, they real shit
All of us don't make it out
Had them killers outside who won't make it out
Had them killers outside, they'll tell you how
I been rollin' the swishers and I want the lord to
Overnight, overnight, overnight, overnight, overnight
I'm in the club with some real niggas
Sadness around me, how many niggas, they real true
All of us make it out
Had them killers outside who won't make it out
Had them killers outside, they'll tell you how
I been rollin' the swishers and I want the lord to help me

[Verse]
I want to the Lord to help me
I want the Lord to take care me
I wanna stack with my niggas
I want my money get bigger
You talking shit like you made it
Young nigga rich and I'm famous
Balling hard like a Laker
I been riding in a Matrix
Going ride and I'm faded
Going ride and I'm racing
Sipping lean but I'm drinking
So Sprite got me wasted
I don't get it, I don't get it
Diamonds all around me drippin'
You were talking like you want it
So my niggas gonna give it

[Chorus]
Oh, watching that overnight, overnight, overnight, overnight, overnight
I'm in the club with some real niggas
Sadness around me, how many niggas, they real shit
All of us make it out
Had them killers outside who won't make it out
Had them killers outside, they'll tell you how
I been rollin' the swishers and I want the lord to
Overnight, overnight, overnight, overnight, overnight
I'm in the club with some real niggas
Sadness around me, how many niggas, they real true
All of us make it out
Had them killers outside who won't make it out
Had them killers outside, they'll tell you how
I been rollin' the swishers and I want the lord to help me

[Interlude]
Countin'
That foreign in here a Phantom
I'ma show who the rapper
Young nigga had manners
Fuck nigga who lyin'
Told 'em I'm real sorry
Give a fuck, nigga, I'm sorry

[Chorus]
Oh, watching that overnight, overnight, overnight, overnight, overnight
I'm in the club with some real niggas
Sadness around me, how many niggas, they real shit
All of us make it out
Had them killers outside who won't make it out
Had them killers outside, they'll tell you how
I been rollin' the swishers and I want the lord to
Overnight, overnight, overnight, overnight, overnight
I'm in the club with some real niggas
Sadness around me, how many niggas, they real true
All of us make it out
Had them killers outside who won't make it out
Had them killers outside, they'll tell you how
I been rollin' the swishers and I want the lord to help me
