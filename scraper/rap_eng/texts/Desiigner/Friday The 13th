31st is Halloween
Chase you, come out and they scream
Freddy come chase you in your dreams
Quiet, start the scene, bells ring
Caskets, they closin' and things
And I start to ball, LeBron James
And I start to ball like Chris Paul
And I start to ball like Lonzo Ball
Once I start to ball, I can't fall
Once I get the ball, I go to score
Pussy start to drip, Niagara Falls
Divin' in that pussy, never fall
