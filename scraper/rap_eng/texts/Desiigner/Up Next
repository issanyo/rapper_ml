[Verse 1: Desiigner]
I went to London, I made it
I trip from London to Vegas
Went from the 'ject, from the slums
I get this shit 'cause I'm famous
I get this shit, get it done
You can get hit with the drums
Choppa move, better run
Pick yo ass just for fun
I fuck yo bitch, we up next
I made her suck at the jet
I might just get up and flex
I did this move to the left
I might just move 'cross the street
I make a hunnid a week
Ride this shit when I'm sleep
Dick, she gargle when she sleep
Hunnid stack, hunnid stack, hunnid stack
I make a lot of new hunnid stacks
I invest into the shake shack
Ain't no monkeys where the apes at
Bullets hit 'em, hmm, take that
Bullets hit 'em, hmm, take that
Henny shots, take, take rack
Once it's gone, can't take back

[Chorus: Desiigner]
I fuck yo bitch, we up next, huh
Half of them niggas upset, hey
I fuck yo bitch, we up next, huh
Half of them niggas upset, huh
JBL with the clothes line
JBL, hit 'em both times
Bada boom, hit 'em, bada bing
Choppas off then them choppas ring
I done get it, nigga, bottom thing
I done get it, nigga, bottom line
JBL with the clothes line
JBL, hit 'em both times
I put these bitches up next, huh
Half of these niggas upset, hey
I put these bitches up next, huh

[Verse 2: Desiigner]
Gang gang, gang gang
Chain gang, chain gang
Gang lane, gang lane
Sell hard, slang thangs
Bells off, rang thangs
Whip that, blade thangs
I'm in the rarest positions
Stacking up dollar, I'm flipping
Two Beamer, two Beamer
I'm in this ride, in that two seater
New 'Gatti, new 'Gatti
I'm in this valley, my new Beamer
Black bodies, black bodies
Niggas is strapped up with two heaters
Niggas who ain't 'bout it, now these niggas 'bout it
Riding with two heaters
I get the money, bitch, I get, I get money, bitch
Counting hunnids, bitch, brand new, brand new hunnids, bitch
Call my whole squad, we be getting shit
Got my whole squad, we be stupid rich

[Chorus: Desiigner]
I fuck yo bitch, we up next, huh
Half of them niggas upset, hey
I fuck yo bitch, we up next, huh
Half of them niggas upset, huh
JBL with the clothes line
JBL, hit 'em both times
Bada boom, hit 'em, bada bing
Choppas off then them choppas ring

[Verse 3: Ski Mask The Slump God]
Bada bing, bada bing, bada fucking on a big bitch
Sucking dick and don't finish â€˜til the fat lady sing
Take a look at my bling, this a one of one
Looking like I got it straight from the Lord of the Rings
Like beep beep beep
High driving crazy like I got no seatbelt
[?]
I might need a diaper 'cause [?] saying that I'm the feces
My flow be crawly, it's creepy
That's why she suck me all neatly
Scorpio diamonds, they freaky
Leaky, kinky
Feeling like I'm Bart, tell 'em eat my shorts
I am on a port, while I smoke my 'Port
Just like she a straw, I'ma bend her foward
Her legs go up like my doors

[Chorus: Desiigner]
I fuck yo bitch, we up next, huh
Half of them niggas upset, hey
I fuck yo bitch, we up next, huh
Half of them niggas upset, huh
JBL with the clothes line
JBL, hit 'em both times
Bada boom, hit 'em, bada bing
Choppas off then them choppas ring
I done get it, nigga, bottom thing
I done get it, nigga, bottom line
JBL with the clothes line
JBL, hit 'em both times
I put these bitches up next, huh
Half of these niggas upset, hey
I put these bitches up next, huh
I get these niggas upset, hey
