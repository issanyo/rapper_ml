[Verse]
I got broads in Atlanta
Twisting dope, lean, and shit, sipping Fanta
Credit cards and the scammers
Wake up Versace shit, life Designer
A whole bunch of lavish shit
They be asking in town who be clappin shit
I be pullin' up stuff in the Phantom ship
I got plenty of stuff of Bugatti whip, look how I drive this shit
Black X6, Phantom
White X6, killing on camera
Pop a bottle, cannot stand up
Gorilla, they come and kill you with bananas
Four fillas, they finna fill up in the Phantom
Nowadays, they come and kill you on the camera
Big Rollie, it dancing bigger than a Pandie
Go Oscar for Grammy, now pull up your panties
Fill up, I'mma flip it, I got bitches pull up and they get it
I got somebody counting for digits
Say you made you a lot of new money
Know some killers pull off and they in the Wraith
CTD, they pull off and they kill the Bape
Call up Phillip-Phillip, they gone fill the bank, we go up in the bank
We gonna drill the bank, hell, we gone kill the bank, get it
I got broads, yeah, I said it
I got cards, yeah, I shitted
This how I live it, did it all for a ticket
Now Flex do bombs when he spit it and Bobby gon' trend it
Jeff The Don doing business
Zana Ray spinning this shit and she doin' her business
I be getting to the chicken, counting to the chicken
And all of my people can split it
