[Chorus: Desiigner & Jay Critch]
They want me make a hit
So I'mma make a hit
Then I'mma date your bitch
Then I'mma take your bitch
She said don't fuck up the Xan'
I make up a lot of new flows
Got bitches stackin' and pourin'
I'mma just stack it and throw it
You niggas just stack it to show it
Movin' racks and the pack and we pour it
I might get me some cash and blow it
But I still got a bag, you know it
Hold up
You cannot see through this whip, 'cause the windows is tinted
Pour up, we gotta celebrate, we was broke for a minute

[Verse 1: Desiigner]
I'm sippin' too much in Tokyo
I make your girl catch the holy ghost
Niggas ran up and I grab the toy
Diamonds dancing, that's Goyard
I'm overnight catching hangovers
She over night bingin' friends over
We overnight with the gang over
We overnight, then we bang over
I'm gettin' rich for days
I'm in this shit for days
Pick up some choppers, we blast at em
You gettin' hit, if the Math add up
Shawty pull up at the trap house
[?]
I know not to talk, if feds grab me
After the party, we hit ground

[Chorus: Desiigner & Jay Critch]
They want me make a hit
So I'mma make a hit
Then I'mma date your bitch
Then I'mma take your bitch
She said don't fuck up the Xan'
I make up a lot of new flows
Got bitches stackin' and pourin'
I'mma just stack it and throw it
You niggas just stack it to show it
Movin' racks and the pack and we pour it
I might get me some cash and blow it
But I still got a bag, you know it
Hold up
You cannot see through this whip, 'cause the windows is tinted
Pour up, we gotta celebrate, we was broke for a minute

[Verse 2: Jay Critch]
Take another sip, might crash
She like, "Why the whip so fast?"
On the road to the cash and
Steppin' out, high fashion
Lil' shawty suck me up with a passion
Talkin' money, bankroll everlastin'
Movin' funny, I'm with 40, he blastin'
[?] makin' this shit stretch like elastics
I was still on my grind, it got to me
Keep ya' eyes on the prize
Stop watchin' me
Walking look like I'm hittin' a lottery
Gotta shit on these niggas
They doubted me
Went overseas for the hundos
For the cheese, niggas cut throat
My diamonds beat like a drumroll
This type of money, I can't trust hoes
I remember them days my funds low
Hood Fave, I stay where them bucks go
My chains is makin' the sun glow
Pay attention to everythin' but hoes
Now I wanna drop, when I sip up
My pockets been doin' the sit ups
Money been callin', I pick up
Diamonds been shinnin', they lit up
Oh

[Chorus: Desiigner & Jay Critch]
They want me make a hit
So I'mma make a hit
Then I'mma date your bitch
Then I'mma take your bitch
She said don't fuck up the Xan'
I make up a lot of new flows
Got bitches stackin' and pourin'
I'mma just stack it and throw it
You niggas just stack it to show it
Movin' racks and the pack and we pour it
I might get me some cash and blow it
But I still got a bag, you know it
Hold up
You cannot see through this whip, 'cause the windows is tinted
Pour up, we gotta celebrate, we was broke for a minute
