Now what more they tryna say?
You believed it after so long
Get the hell up out my face
Kept it realer than a rhinestone
Only diamonds on my plate
Whipped a cookie, that's a milestone
The numbers as good as the taste grraa
Felt like I was servin' weight yay
Fuck around, move outta state yeah
If they say I was D.O.A.,
I probably went ghost in a Wraith Grrrrraaaah
Had me feeling like the man above, I was coming up in 7 days
Check the board again, its going up

[Verse 3-J-Ron  Desiigner]
Way too long, I was in the house for too long
Potential numbers make me move on
I hit the block like a lego
Couldn't let go, it was too strong
Track came with the plug
First check, he wrote it up
Midtown on they ass
Flippin' records that's a splash
Bust a check and then I dab, wooo
Damn a nigga hit a come up
Damn a nigga here to come up aye
Haters lurking, tell em run up
I doubt they ass would even luck up, nah
The wait too long, and the plate too long
Shawty over here at the place too long
Bend that ass, give her something thats way too long
But don't stay too long lllllllaaah
