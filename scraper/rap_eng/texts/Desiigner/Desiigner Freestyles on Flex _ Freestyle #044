My niggas be mobbin' all day
50 shots in the K, I let it spray
Get tackled by bullets, you get in my way
My life is a game so I'm ready to play
I'm smellin' that kumba, you sniffin' that yay
Fuck what you say 'cause a nigga get shot
Totin' that Glock and a nigga get popped
Now a few opps, they be snitchin' to cops
Think I'm a baby boy, no I ain't Jody
Pick up that .40, put holy your moly
The way I got two phones you think that I'm Kobe
Smokin' on dope, you call Zack and that Cody
If you got problems I'll call up my broski
Fuckin' so good and her pussy get swole
Bullets hit you and it damage your soul
This is what happens you tell what you told
Rippin' that white like a slave on a soul
Pen is makin' that cash
Smoke with no scope and you callin' that blast
Givin' me brain and I'm thinkin' too fast
Hannibal Lector, I put on that mask
Whippin' the Jag, grippin' the mag
And if you run, a whole clip in your ass
Your bitch suckin' dick while she doin' the dishes
She got a small mouth, the way she be lippin'
The mack, got your boo, Scottie breathin', be Pippen
The beeper chirp, that's not an upper ignition
A nigga said you dodgin' me, is you kiddin'?

12 tried to lock me up but a nigga beat the case
Tried to put the drugs on me, guns on me, I speed away
I done jumped out, i8
Two cars, made nigga, see the Wraith?
TMZ tell my mommy, daddy
Tried to lock me up, put me in the cage
Got that Ruger on me, a .45 in the cooler on me
Steroids and a few homies
Everybody tried to back out
Everybody had toolas on me
Everybody see a young nigga gettin' money
So niggas pulled it on me
Everybody tryna get a live brick
Everybody fuck with the phony
Ayy I fuck around, pop shit
Don't touch, I'll pop shit
Shout out to the G.O.O.D. Music

Two Bimmers, got a couple bitches and a couple....
Lobby

Everybody poppin'
Couple of heaters on me
Finna pull up with them speakers on me
You talkin' up and get heated, homie
Fuck around, 'round, gon' get it
From the trip, nigga know you with it
From the trip, nigga know I did it
On the 40 deuce with a couple bitches
In the Uber truck, ain't nobody snitchin', ayy, ayy
12 tried to lock me up, but a nigga beat the case
Tried to put the drugs on me, guns on me
Everybody tried to beat the Wraith
Halloween, bugged out, thugged out
Everybody tried to be a snake
Cops told me that's my gun, my gun
Everybody in the Wraith, that's my whip
Don't touch, that's my shit
Don't touch, that's my shit
Don't touch, that's my shit
Don't touch, that's my shit
Cop told me that's my drug, that's my gun, that's my shit
