[Chorus: Desiigner]
This goes for all around the world
To the world is gone
This go all around the world
So we carry on
This goes for all around the world
To the world is gone
This go all around the world
So we carry on (67, click-clack!)

[Verse 1: Liquez]
I'm drunk from the show last night but
I gotta catch a flight in the morning
More time we overseas doing shows
'cause the UK got boring
Young rich nigga, know I stay balling
If I take shots in the field, then I'm scoring
Click clack bang, watch how they falling
On sight, shoot man down with no warning
Violent when we do the roads
Scrrr up, hit man up and then go
Dimzy just know that's my bro
If you're on him, I'm giving out smoke
From young, I've been doing road
Had handguns, shottys all in my home
All skengman, the  opps, them man know

[Verse 2: LD]
Drilla. Who you know that's realer?
I get opps and awards and the pengest of gyal
How the fuck could I not be a winner? (How)
It's been two years since SJ lurked
'Bout time that they freed my hitter
T Rolz that's bro
MA that's bro
I'm surrounded by trappers and drillas
New wap, gorgeous
Beyonc√© clip 'cause it's flawless
Can't lay down with every gyal
I'm not anyone, b, I'm cautious
Big weapon, low mileage, hot stepping in Jordans
Amsterdam that's my second home
They ain't treating man like no tourist

[Chorus: Desiigner]
This goes for all around the world
To the world is gone
This go all around the world
So we carry on
This goes for all around the world
To the world is gone
This go all around the world
So we carry on

[Verse 3: ASAP]
Dasheen
Straight to the bando, getting that cash in
Money haffi mek, money haffi mash
Taking trips all around the world
I go overseas for them bands
I don't ever change, I just switch it up
Big .44 make a man bitch up
From old school, we've been drilling stuff
Two skengs in a 4-door truck
Peng tings wanna rock with us
Tell a sexy girl twerk it up
Peng tings wanna rock with us
Tell a sexy girl twerk it up
Mad

[Verse 4: Dimzy]
Let's lurk then get back to work
Feds won't let me go, they love searching
They just wanna stop a man earning
Every  pig deserves to get burnt
We brought waps out of them Germans
Chunky stones, I watched them disperse
So think first
Wap with a clip on the side, take you off this earth
We was on the block in them flights
Now bookings overseas, we do flights
On stage in the crowd, I see lights
And lights, and lights
White girls go red when I say hi
I'm smoking cookie spliffs for the night
I remember team days on bikes
We left pools of blood where he lied

[Verse 5: Monkey]
This hammer gon' make you famous
Roll up on your block
2 shells up, leave a nigga brainless
From way back, been pulling up in 4 doors with no faces
With the gang charging them flavours
See this cookie here is outrageous
Yo, man's doing this for the hood
Hood niggas from the southwest, trap line bling cos it should
Gunsmoke for the opps
Them man be spinning round in their hood
67 going global, man I never knew that we would

[Chorus: Desiigner]
This goes for all around the world
To the world is gone
This go all around the world
So we carry on
This goes for all around the world
To the world is gone
This go all around the world
So we carry on

[Outro: Dimzy & Monkey]
Get me, alla dat
Gang, gang
