[Intro]
Kill, kill, kill, kill
Wait, aaah, aah-ah
What a surprise, first part there
Ayy, word, aaah
(It's JSDG with another banger)
Desiigner! (git, git, grrra)

[Chorus]
She in the afterparty
We in the afterparty
She in the afterparty
We in the afterparty
Had a party in Cali
She in the afterparty
Had a party in Atlanta
She in the afterparty
Had a party in New York
Afterparty (afterparty)
Afterparty (a-afterparty)
She at the afterparty (a-a-afterparty)
Had a party in Cali
At the afterparty (afterparty)
Had a party in Atlanta
At the afterparty

[Verse 1]
She at the afterparty
She don't know how to party
She did this act to party
We in the back to party
We tryna get back to party
At the afterparty
We can shoot up with MACs and .40s
Heard you talkin' shit, beg your pardon
Heard you talkin' shit, beg your pardon
With this .45 I bet it bang your noggin (woo, woo)
Had to made some party
With the masses like Jason parties
In the back from the face of shawty
We in the afterparty
And she don't know how to party
She gon' just act to party

[Chorus]
She in the afterparty
We in the afterparty
She in the afterparty
We in the afterparty
Had a party in Cali
She in the afterparty
Had a party in Atlanta
She in the afterparty
Had a party in New York
Afterparty (afterparty)
Afterparty (a-afterparty)
She at the afterparty (a-a-afterparty)
Had a party in Cali
At the afterparty (afterparty)
Had a party in Atlanta
At the afterparty

[Verse 2]
We in the party intoxicated
She bent over, all kinda wasted
Big diamonds, all kind of faces
Shinin' bright around the places
Let this lean put me in the Matrix
She like how she feelin', she like how it taste
She make it feel good when I'm wasted
I don't know nothin' but automatics
Niggas run up on you, let you have it
Chopper hit 'em, trrr, static
My young boys, yeah, they a savage
How you say you the big homie?
And you made me cop weed from him
Five dollars what you need from me
Gave it to you 'cause you need it, homie
Now I'm chillin' at the afterparty
And I'm here and I ain't have to party
Now you dead, nigga, now you sorry
You can stay here but just keep it quiet
'Cause my niggas they come alive
I invest into the Shake Shack
But I spin your block with like five guys
Don't believe me? Nigga, let you try
Don't believe me? Nigga, let you ride
See my posts up on Instagram
See a kid, you a family man
Sixteen shots like a family jam
I hope y'all niggas really get it, man
Damn, they ain't even understand
Yeah, nigga, at the afterparty
And I'm here and I ain't have to party

[Chorus]
She in the afterparty
We in the afterparty
She in the afterparty
We in the afterparty
Had a party in Cali
She in the afterparty
Had a party in Atlanta
She in the afterparty
Had a party in New York
Afterparty (afterparty)
Afterparty (a-afterparty)
She at the afterparty (a-a-afterparty)
Had a party in Cali
At the afterparty (afterparty)
Had a party in Atlanta
At the afterparty

[Outro]
Damn, son, where did you get that from?
