[Hook]
I make a lot of new different money
Trap overnight like it's fifty summie
Finesse up the plug while gettin', I'm gettin' blunted
Caliber, caliber, caliber
Caliber, caliber, get somebody
Caliber, caliber, sick somebody
Caliber, caliber, rip somebody
Caliber, caliber, caliber

[Verse 1]
I make a lot of new different money
All my killas pull up and they gettin' blunted
Finna drink up the mud, now I'm gettin' mudded
Caliber, caliber, caliber

Silencer, silencer, ring somebody
Outy boy, outy boy in an Audi
Free my boy, white boy gon get 'em
Free my boy white, go get him Follie

Sniff the coco right up cause your bitch got problems
Wildin' boy, wildin' boy, wildin' boy
Life of Desiigner be stylin' boy
You gettin' hit up, I get annoyed
Mike on the wheel and I drive the toy
You get robbed or get jigg or you got extort

[Bridge]
Tell 'em talk shit, tell 'em talk shit, I'ma keep throwin'
That's your bitch, that's your bitch, that be deep throatin'
We be swipin' cards, we be gettin' money, there's weed blowin'
That's lean drippin', we lean drippin', that's cee-lo in
We be rollin' 6s, tell 'em roll with me
You gon' go get it? We gon' go get 'em
All my niggas got it, all my niggas with it
We got bad strippers, we got niggas with it
Gheea, gheea!
