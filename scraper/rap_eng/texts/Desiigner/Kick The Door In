[Verse 1: Rah Smooth]
Better days, life after pass
How I start in the race, coming in last
Broke when they curved me, couldn’t even get mad
I see my diamonds, my future digital dash
End of the year on the same roll
Knock a few times but I’m still with the same goals
Quiet in the room, still live by the same code
Too many lady problems, now I see why y’all love hoes
Lord knows, I keep my distance
Hundred thou is a mention
Blow candles for my wishes
Friends never go with business
Rather call my brothers, gotta lean on each other
It ain’t nothing wrong would help from one another
I talk this real, I need a mil
Lil niggas plotting and waiting to catch a drill
Trayvon hoodie on, you got to prove me wrong
Couldn’t get it right with my chick, it’s time to move along
Pray every day even though I know I’m sinning
I’m winning, I never said it’s right from the beginning
Trust in myself, my family, and nothing else
And fuck how you got it if you constantly taking L’s
I know it’s part of balance, I promise I will prevail
Hoping if they reach they won’t do me like Shawn Bell
You can’t walk a mile in mine, he sweet as Valentines
I even got connects through the Navy, I make it Colombine
I’m ‘bout a dollar sign, I go down for mine
And these bitches probably hate me, but I had to lie
I’m talking what’s real
And you never catch my name but I signed the seal

[Hook: Desiigner]
I’ma keep pouring
Four ring, it’s getting loud, nausea
Me and Rah, rollin’ the six, no drilling
I be ridin’, rollin’, and yeen know I’m dripping
Had to kick the door in
Four four with a mask, fuck with me
He ain’t lie, man them niggas fuck with me
Hey, had to kick the door in
Had to kick the door in
Had to kick the door in
Had to kick the door in

[Verse 2: Rah Smooth]
Keep reaching, you pass indecent
And fuck average, what lame niggas be preaching
You can’t man up if your feet ain’t planted on cement
It’s not a dollar, I promise it’s no agreements
Smooth back at you, let’s roll backwoods
Henny in foam plasters
You got the piece, know that it’s hookah after
Chicks from my past call me a bastard
I’m giving my heads to pastors
And tell ‘em watch my kids ‘cause they growing faster
Certain shit, I won’t condone that
My niggas [?] my temper, it’s no hold back
Hundred for a hundred, the homies don’t need a phone tap
Face to face only, my niggas really be on that
Friend or foe, she a wife or a hoe
Too many niggas call me bro
But these niggas I don’t know
Jeezy boys, moving in the snow man
Hungry for the paper, since I heard I love the dope fam
The dope came, I changed up
That’s the most, you’re probably safe
Couldn’t walk in my shoes, they’re changing [?]
Ask my niggas, tell you Smooth’s still the same today
Couldn’t stay in traffic so I turned and made my own lane
Here for a reason, [?] say she need me
Don’t make sense so my moms ain’t playing easy
Drool as I work, smile from the dirt
Real niggas make it work
When you grind, know your worth

[Hook: Desiigner]
I’ma keep pouring
Four ring, it’s getting loud, nausea
Me and Rah, rollin’ the six, no drilling
I be ridin’, rollin’, and yeen know I’m dripping
Had to kick the door in
Four four with a mask, fuck with me
He ain’t lie, man them niggas fuck with me
Hey, had to kick the door in
Had to kick the door in
Had to kick the door in
Had to kick the door in
