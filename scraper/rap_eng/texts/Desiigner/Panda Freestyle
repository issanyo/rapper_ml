The freestyle of panda Yeah
M, Ha ha
Black panda

Verse 1
Black and white like panda
Cash money like panda
Act like panda
Everyone in my show got guns and bitches I'm hands up
I feel like black panda cause I'm a black guy
Take my songs and remix it with niggas of yours
Girls love me maybe is because of the way I push money like a
Scammer Even when bafana ba ko kasi ba txia di whyphy ba di
Tsoba
I'm master of panda and I'm from the forest
I have been killing this for 7 years
Girl don't act like I need you cause I need Indian girl
Every street I walk, I see nothing but you
Maybe is because of the way I got panda stoko
And I ke fana ka sona
Taking rag from F tree
And don't be j-e-alous of this
Cause I'm from the forest and in the forest we make hits
Nothing more, nothing less with my black panda
When I'm here, I'm making hits
Yeah
Lfm we here tonight killing the show
I'm young nigga from young town with young panda

Outro
Yeah yeah
