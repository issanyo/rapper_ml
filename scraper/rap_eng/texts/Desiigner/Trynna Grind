[Intro: Young Bart]
We do this all the time
Niggas always on their grind

[Hook: Young Bart]
We all out here tryna grind
So shout out to my money makin' bitches, do your thing
And shout out to my niggas gettin' money cause we outchea
And all this money out here, I'ma get it, ain't no doubt there
We all out here tryna grind
So shout out to my money makin' bitches, do your thing
And shout out to my niggas gettin' money cause we outchea
And all this money out here, I'ma get it, ain't no doubt there

[Verse 1: Yung Boy]
This young nigga tryna set shit straight
If your goal is not the money then we cannot relate
You fuck niggas, broke niggas, I'm a big spender
If you ain't with it, then get missin', this a movement
And I just hit the game winnin' shot, I'm never losin'
All this money in my vision, you know I'm snoozin'
Anybody actin' up, I'm goin' fuckin' ruthless
And shout out to my savages, them boys that really do this
Down to ride for the come up
All about these bills, niggas, don't get touched up
Coolin' like a Rasta
Real proper, rollin' my mothafuckin' ganja
Smokin' on that power
Hit that O and now I'm totin' on a money hunt
Hit a pussy nigga up for tryna front
All about these Bens, niggas feelin' up like a ceilin' fan
Bitches packin' grams, bitches tryna be my number one fan
I'm tryna be that man, yeah I'm puttin' on for my squad
Walkin' alone, I'ma get this money on my own
I ain't never had no handouts, so I stand out
I'm just a young nigga
I made mistakes, shit wasn't great
But I bounced back and got my plate
A little motivation
And some ass shakin' ain't never hurt
To all the niggas that ain't fuck with me
When I pull up, I'm like, SKRRT
To all the bitches that fucked with me
I know you quite hurt
But I'm tryna get it together
I'm just too clever, a young nigga that's from Bed Stuy
Let lead fly, hold heads high
And do what I gotta do
This shit is here for everybody
So you can get it too

[Hook: Young Bart]
We all out here tryna grind
So shout out to my money makin' bitches, do your thing
And shout out to my niggas gettin' money cause we outchea
And all this money out here, I'ma get it, ain't no doubt there
We all out here tryna grind
So shout out to my money makin' bitches, do your thing
And shout out to my niggas gettin' money cause we outchea
And all this money out here, I'ma get it, ain't no doubt there

[Verse 2: Desiigner]
Look like a demon jumpin' out the Bimmer
Grandma stay with the nina
You better duck if you fuckin' seen her
Turn a non believer, turn to believer
Sellin' white like Justin Bieber
In the pan I'm whippin' Peter
L.O.D., that's in me
Ray Charles, you can't see me
My money large like an oak tree
I'ma OD on this OG
Got a bad bitch, she on me
I'm sick and tired of the police
Took entire, let me relapse
Hold on, let me relax
My seat back, on recline
Throw it back like a rewind
I'ma start it, I'ma fuckin' end it
I'ma spend it, yeah I fuckin' spend it
Young villain that's fuckin' gettin' it
Got a couple bitches and they with the shits
They talkin' loud and then they give defaced
They'll bite the bullet, tell me I can taste
This codeine got me slow, Matrix
Used to chase the money, now it chase me
Young boy, I'm the money man
Bow, bow, do the money dance
Just me and a couple friends
Ride around with a couple bands
Kickflip the brick, then I grind
Ice on me so you know it shine
I let 'em run, then I get the nine
I let 'em run, then I get the nine
