[Chorus: Desiigner]
Hide the money, I keep it real
Know nuttin' else but to keep it real
Mama always told me keep it real, fuck the lying shit it get you killed
Screw your face up with the drill
Young nigga originally stacking this mil
Don't give a fuck how you feel
Hide the money, I keep it real
Know nuttin' else but to keep it real
Mama always told me keep it real, fuck the lying shit it get you killed
Screw your face up with the drill
Young nigga rich and he's stacking this mil'
Don't give a fuck how you feel

[Bridge: Desiigner]
I been getting money all night playa
I been getting money all night, I played ya
With this brick I could make it
Slip it all for this paper
Codeine sipping late gooder
Go buy this purple fanta
Panda, Panda, Panda, Panda
Panda, Panda, I'm in danger
Put the MAC on your shoulder you dipstick it's red lipstick [?]
Threw hundred thousand in the club, when I do a hundred yeah I get the paper
Yeah these niggas get the bands up
Dunk, dunk hit a lay-up

[Verse 1: Fredo]
Young nigga counting them racks
Turning the powder to crack
Niggas should 'low all the chat, if you had money how would you act?
I'm living this life, don't listen to dem they're living a lie
After I whip up this brick into 5 think I might go take a trip to Dubai
These bricks got me dripping in ice
Your chick want some dick for the night
My uncle try give me advice like I don't know he's been hitting the pipe
This shit isn't nice, so we cash out on clothes and glittery ice
Bro this brick isn't right, how it ain't even lockin' it's sitting in ice
Catch me in my trap I'm laughing, it's a joke
Cos I just sold a boy a brick and only half of it was coke
Can you catch my drift?
I was young in mums tryna add some mix
She came home early, caught me cooking nearly had a fit

[Chorus: Desiigner]
Hide the money, I keep it real
Know nuttin' else but to keep it real
Mama always told me keep it real, fuck the lying shit it get you killed
Screw your face up with the drill
Young nigga originally stacking this mil
Don't give a fuck how you feel

[Bridge: Desiigner]
I been getting money all night playa
I been getting money all night, I played ya
With this brick I could make it
Slip it all for this paper
Codeine sipping late gooder
Go buy this purple fanta
Panda, Panda, Panda, Panda
Panda, Panda, I'm in danger
Put the MAC on your shoulder you dipstick it's red lipstick [?]
Threw hundred thousand in the club, when I do a hundred yeah I get the paper
Yeah these niggas get the bands up
Dunk, dunk hit a lay-up

[Verse 2: Dave East]
Young nigga got my cake out
[?] Japan got my BAPE out
In my lap I got makeup, she was just dying to taste cuz
[?] came pulling Wraith up
Dice on me nigga shake something
Shooter with me he gon' take something
You owe the plug you ain't making nuttin'
Diamonds looking like a water park
So much money I don't wanna talk
If they catch him know he gonna talk
All these foreigns I don't wanna walk
All this money, shit I gotta spend
You ain't got it but we got it in
I'm here for paper, got a lot of friends over 16 I could cop a Benz
Handle dough with my leadership, you never had coke on your fingertips
I thought to get rich I would need a brick
I would never ever need a bitch
FedEx tell me that I need a hit, street nigga I just need a lift
Your wife told me that she needed dick
Go anywhere you ain't seeing this

[Chorus: Desiigner]
Hide the money, I keep it real
Know nuttin' else but to keep it real
Mama always told me keep it real, fuck the lying shit it get you killed
Screw your face up with the drill
Young nigga originally stacking this mil
Don't give a fuck how you feel
Hide the money, I keep it real
Know nuttin' else but to keep it real
Mama always told me keep it real, fuck the lying shit it get you killed
Screw your face up with the drill
Young nigga originally stacking this mil
Don't give a fuck how you feel
