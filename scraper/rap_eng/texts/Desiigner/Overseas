[Chorus: Desiigner & Lil Pump]
I fucked your bitch, she a freak, huh
Nigga, I'm trappin' all week, huh
I do a pill and can't eat, oh
I let a bitch rub my feet, ooh (Brrt)
I made a mill in a week, yeah (Yeah)
I bring the pints overseas, ooh
I spilled some lean on my sheets, ooh (Ooh, ooh)
Yeah
I fucked your bitch, she a freak, huh
Nigga, I'm trappin' all week
I do a, I do a pill and can't eat (Ooh)

I fucked your bitch, call me Pablo, huh
Fucked me for a Instagram follow, huh
Demon, I drop the diablo, hmm (Damn, whoa)
I nut in her mouth and she swallow, huh (Huh?)
Trappin', I'm feelin' like Pablo, huh
Choppers, they fill you with hollows (Ooh)
Bitch, I'm in Europe sippin' on syrup
Look at my bust down, this baller alert (Damn)
I took her credit card out of her purse (Wow)
Bitch, I'm in Portugal off of a Perc (Ooh)
Ooh, damn, ooh, damn, ooh (Damn)

Ooh, damn, ooh, damn (Huh?)
I took your bitch and you can't get her back (Nope)

[Verse 2: Desiigner & Lil Pump]
I just fucked your bitch
Fucked your bitch, now what up? (Git, git)
Diamonds on my wrist
Motherfucker, shut the fuck up (Yeah, nice, yeah)
If you ain't gettin' money
Motherfucker, shut the fuck up (Nuh-uh, huh)
Got your broad in the back
And the bitch gettin' fucked up (Yeah)
Fuck my P.O. (Fuck her)
And I'm still screaming out, "Free Greedo"
Auntie shipping out packs to Puerto Rico (Git)
Pull up in a all white Gucci tuxedo (Goddamn)
D. Rose, D. Rose, D. Rose
A.R. got a red dot like Cheetos (Grrrah)
And I'm in a PJ, and I'm in a PJ
With five strippers and five kilos (No cap)
