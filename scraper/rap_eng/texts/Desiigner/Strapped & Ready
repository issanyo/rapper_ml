[Intro: Rah Smooth, Desiigner & Nick Papz]
How do you feel now, huh?
Ah, ah, ah
[?] I think niggas strapped and ready (slim)
We dare got a green light on these niggas
Ah
High life nigga
(Pa-Pa-Papamitrou Boi!)

[Hook: Desiigner]
Better have the chopper ready
Have all these niggas, all these niggas, got the deal backstage
Gotta cut it up and go in my lair
Bet it was drivin’ ‘em crazy
Said I'm getting money, said I'm acting funny
Got pockets boomin’ like confetti
Gonna get up and go in my lair
Bentley, just drivin’ around
Like low [?], dumb bitch, I pop big Rosé
Better get on that ho’s level
Bet it was drivin’ ‘em crazy
I don't know what to say
Bet these broke niggas mad
Better get on that ho’s level
Better have the chopper on

[Verse 1]
Smoke on that drop
Real nigga you not
Don’t meet standards, you flop
[?], more top
Same dude, don’t play fool, you fuck around and get dropped
My niggas on that same time, they ready if you not
Slow it down, high life how I roll around
Times got hard then the money went up
Now all these hoes want to go down
Hold it down, matter fact get from ‘round
One call then Cali put it on the table
Then it just blow a pound
I’m Smooth nigga, you know that
Fuck hoess, where the dough at?
Cuz come home from the low jack
I made a promise, never broke that
No nametag, can’t go back
You can catch one where your throat at
Talk dumb, just hold that
Nigga collapse, then turn back
That pistol on ya bruh, call Desiigner up
Tell ‘em get strapped and ready, got a lot of drums
We in the lobby done, looking for mami son
I think we got one

[Hook: Desiigner]
Better have the chopper ready
Have all these niggas, all these niggas, got the deal backstage
Gotta cut it up and go in my lair
Bet it was drivin’ ‘em crazy
Said I'm getting money, said I'm acting funny
Got pockets boomin’ like confetti
Gonna get up and go in my lair
Bentley, just drivin’ around
Like low [?], dumb bitch, I pop big Rosé
Better get on that ho’s level
Bet it was drivin’ ‘em crazy
I don't know what to say
Bet these broke niggas mad
Better get on that ho’s level
Better have the chopper on

[Verse 2]
I’m with the big dogs now so I got to be stuntin’
On the route to the cash, I need them lottery numbers
Play an OG like he Kobe, I’m retiring niggas
I be a pastor on the beat ‘cause I’m inspiring niggas, nigga
Young man spent bump bands on Jumpmans
A couple friends whose four grand’s a hundred bands
I overdo it so niggas don’t really understand
Understand my niggas soldiers, you niggas undermanned
On demand, my niggas G’s just like a couple grand
Couple grand, take off your top and stuff it
Don’t fuck with him, good luck with him
Addicted to profit, time to go talk to him
Nigga, I couldn’t wait to get my cash right
So I could shit on you niggas, call me an ass wipe
You niggas live in the past like this was last night
That’s right, cut off my circle like it’s a halfpipe

[Verse 3]
Pull up to the door, leave with your booboo, she give me brain
She kinda mental, she go cuckoo, I ask her what’s her name
She say doesn’t matter, she acting like a bird, made me want to smack her
Macking at the [?], bud on the [?]
Too cool for school, keep a hammer ‘cause I’m frail
But everybody said they real but for me it’s hard to tell
The weed is exotic, got to roll a couple L’s
It’s back to the grizzy, I’m mellow with the piffy
A modern day hippie, don’t make me back out the semi
I hit him, he spinning, he dizzy
Choppers singing like Drizzy
I’m all about the hustle, I take a sip to get Nipsey
Your bitch want to be mixing, smoking up a 50
Bet I keep it a hundred, [?] awards, I’m blunted
Going there like fuck it, middle finger to the fuck niggas
When them bullets get to spittin’, better duck nigga

[Hook: Desiigner]
Better have the chopper ready
Have all these niggas, all these niggas, got the deal backstage
Gotta cut it up and go in my lair
Bet it was drivin’ ‘em crazy
Said I'm getting money, said I'm acting funny
Got pockets boomin’ like confetti
Gonna get up and go in my lair
Bentley, just drivin’ around
Like low [?], dumb bitch, I pop big Rosé
Better get on that ho’s level
Bet it was drivin’ ‘em crazy
Fell in love on the stage
Stanley [?] engraved
Can’t take ‘em home to my lair
Bentley, just drivin’ around
