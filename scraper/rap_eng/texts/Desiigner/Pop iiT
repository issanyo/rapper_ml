[Intro]
Ayy
Ayy, ah, ayy
Ooh, aye
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah

[Chorus]
Popping Percocet, all night, yeah
I fell in love, yeah
I fell in love, yeah
She be whining, over drugs, yeah
She be rolling, overnight, yeah
I got a trap phone
And my bank account plenty
I want it all in a minute
I want it all, I ain't playing
Drinking all, drinking plenty
How I get like this?
Had to slow it down
Ride around in the Benz when I roll 'round
And I got a 7-seater when it goes down
Sent his ass couple shots, he with the Lord now
And I got a couple killers in the dog pound, dog pound

[Verse]
And I got a broad
She from Portland
Bringing birds in
Got no girlfriend
It won't hurt my stress
Go to Maryland
Count money
All around
I share Xans
Getting no stress
Pop a Percocet
Getting no stress
I found the wrong bean
Then I fall down
I'm drinking slowly
Then I slow down
Pop a Percocet
Getting no stress
I found the wrong bean
Then I fall down
I'm drinking slowly
Then I slow down
Got a 7-seater, when it go down
Pop a Percocet and it hurt your chest
Got a big .9 and it hurt your vest
And I got a tank, hit the first connect
Then I pop yo' car, getting first to check
Then I fuck yo' broad, getting first to neck
Nigga got a Gat, I'll hearse yo' jet
And I got a blonde, she my Hershey kiss
I just bought a AP, I just hurt my wrist
I just bought my AP, I just hurt yo' bitch
I just bought my AP, I just hurt them niggas
When I pull up on you, we be throwing triggers
Got my .40 Cal', make my boys bigger
Pay or PayPal, it ain't no rental
And my Lamborghini cost like five figures
I pull up on yo' block with like five niggas
I heard you fresh to death, so you died nigga

[Chorus]
Popping Percocet, all night, yeah
I fell in love, yeah
I fell in love, yeah
She be whining, over drugs, yeah
She be rolling, overnight, yeah
I got a trap phone
And my bank account plenty
I want it all in a minute
I want it all, I ain't playing
Drinking all, drinking plenty
How I get like this?
Had to slow it down
Ride around in the Benz when I roll 'round
And I got a 7-seater when it goes down
Sent his ass couple shots, he with the Lord now
And I got a couple killers in the dog pound, dog pound
