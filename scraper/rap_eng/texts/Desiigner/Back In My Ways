[Hook: Young King]
Had to get back in my ways
Had to get back in my ways
I had to bring the monster back out the cage
Had to get back in my ways
Had to get back in my ways
They want the old king from back in the days

[Verse 1: Young King]
Had to get back to in my ways
I might fuck around and just back out the wraith
I had to bring the monster back out the cage
They want the old king from back in the days
Fuck a minimum wage
Self made we don't need any favors
I had run it up and fill up the safe
Straight hunnits I just walked out the bank
In the panny the fill the tank
Honey backwoods when I hit on the dank
Fuck ya bitch and yea I give her that pain
Dick in her mouth and its hittin' her brain
In the foreign switching lanes
Back in the days yeah remember them days
Catching them robberies, hittin' them stains
Running down on niggas, snatchin' them chains
Ain't talkin money it ain't relevant
She let me fuck and I just met the bitch
I buy the pussy if she celibate
And I don't never squash beef nigga
I hold grudges like elephant
Catch em, burn em, leave the skeleton
Don't leave no evidence
S 600 the big body Benz
See right through niggas, no sonagram
You niggas be bitches, juwana man
My gun man make em do the runnin' man
I'm just thumbin' through a couple bands
Somebody pass me a rubber band
They say we be tryna flex on the gram
You broke niggas will never understand

[Hook: Young King]
Had to get back in my ways
Had to get back in my ways
I had to bring the monster back out the cage
Had to get back in my ways
Had to get back in my ways
They want the old king from back in the days
Had to get back in my ways
Had to get back in my ways
I had to bring the monster back out the cage
Had to get back in my ways
Had to get back in my ways
They want the old king from back in the days

[Verse 2: Mekado]
Had to get back in my ways
See a young nigga ballin’
Fuck a bitch, never call her
I will never ever spoil her
See a nigga countin’ bands now
Look at me, I’m the man now
Pussy nigga been man down
Couple niggas is my mans now
Rollin’ with a couple killers
Rollin’ with a couple shooters
Finna pull up with the shooters
Them clips looking like a ruler
Born and raised, I’m a stuy nigga
Your bitch on me, I’m a fly nigga
Smokin’ dope, get high nigga
With your bitch, I’m a side nigga
Uh, had to get back in my ways
You couldn’t walk up the block
But this was way back in the day
You had to find another way
Same rules apply, even up to this day
With my niggas, we pull up on your block
Lettin’ it fly, nah, we ain’t lettin’ shit rock
I, roll with the phantom, and they ready to ride
Ride, look at your face, you ready to lie

[Hook: Young King]
Had to get back in my ways
Had to get back in my ways
I had to bring the monster back out the cage
Had to get back in my ways
Had to get back in my ways
They want the old king from back in the days
Had to get back in my ways
Had to get back in my ways
I had to bring the monster back out the cage
Had to get back in my ways
Had to get back in my ways
They want the old king from back in the days

[Verse 3: Desiigner]
Had to get back in my ways
Trapper Booby, he gon’ ride with the K
Nigga said he gon’ ride, most niggas lie

Stacking money big to the ceiling
