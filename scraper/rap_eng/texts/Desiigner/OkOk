[Intro: Thutmose]
Okay, okay (Uh, aye)
Okay, okay (Brrrahh)
Mhm, bad boy
Okay, okay
Desiigner, uh
Okay, okay (Yeah)

[Chorus: Thutmose]
Okay, okay
Hands up in the air, don't move okay (Aye)
Slide the money slow, you'll be okay (Brrrat)
Okay, okay, okay (Yeah, uh)
Okay, okay (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Okay, okay
Hands up in the air, don't move okay (Uh, woo)
Slide the money slow, you'll be okay
Okay, okay, okay (Yeah, aye, woo)

[Verse 1: Thutmose]
Yeah, model chick from Japan, she don't speak no English
Doggy style to missionary, oh she think I'm Christian (Brrat)
Devil wears Prada, gotta ask the lord forgiveness
On her knees, them double D's
Eyes low when she's grabbin' on my Jesus piece
I've never been a killer but I will snap
Don't wanna do that so you better do right
Gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, everything you got
Know karma's gonna get me in due time (Time)
I've been searchin', searchin', think I've found myself
Gold on my neck like I'm Michael Phelps
So I swim in the money 'til I'm outta breath
And I stack up all the cheddar 'til I'm outta debt
Young nigga from the motherland
Never could I trust another man
Some shit you'll never understand
Ever been backstabbed when you knew you couldn't fight back?
Now you stuffin' up the back pack (Aye)
Go ape like I'm Jack Black (Yuh)
Chillin' with the villains and we killin' 'til we a make a million
Hope out of the building and we runnin' with the children
Ain't nobody that can stop us (Woo)

[Chorus: Thutmose]
Okay, okay (Uh, ooo)
Hands up in the air, don't move okay (Hands up in the air)
Slide the money slow, you'll be okay (Heyy)
Okay, okay, okay (Yuh, yeah, uh)
Okay, okay (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Okay, okay
Hands up in the air, don't move okay (Kayy, woo)
Slide the money slow, you'll be okay (Kayy, okay)
Okay, okay (Uh, yeah, okay!)

[Verse 2: Desiigner]
Okay, yeah I am reloaded
Uh, I got my yacht in the ocean
Uh, I got the purp and I'm smokin'
Uh, I got them niggas who want it
Uh, I got them niggas reloaded
Uh, I go against your opponent
Uh, I get up, trap in the morning
Uh, she get up, trap in the morning
Anti Jesus pieces (Aye)
We was all out sellin' Visa pieces
Grab .45, nigga leave in pieces (Brrrah)
I walk around like the bank and I ride in a tank
And a nigga don't believe in Jesus
Gotta watch out for the snakes
Got a Glock in they face
And a nigga don't believe in leashes
And I like Adidas with no creases (Huh)

[Chorus: Thutmose]
Okay, okay (Uh, ooo)
Hands up in the air, don't move okay (Hands up in the air)
Slide the money slow, you'll be okay (Slide the money slow)
Okay, okay, okay (Brrrrahh, uh)
Okay, okay (Woo, yeah)
Okay, okay
Hands up in the air, don't move okay (Yeah, yeah)
Slide the money slow, you'll be okay (Brrrahh)
Okay, okay (Yeah, yeah, yeah)

[Outro: Thutmose]
Hands up in the air, don't move okay
Slide the money slow, you'll be okay
Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, aye
Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah
Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, bad boy, bad boys
