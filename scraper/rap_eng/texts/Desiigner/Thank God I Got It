Thank God I got it, thank God, yeah, nigga, I got it
Thank God, yeah, a nigga ain't plottin'

Young nigga gettin' money, no option
Red beam hit a nigga in traffic
Oh shit, more shit 'fore I pour my ghost shit
Oh shit, more cham', I'm pourin' more shit
Life is fab, but I'm driven, focused
Niggas talk, but I quick reload shit
Make a million, hit 'em with the "oh shit"
Hit him with the oh o-shit
Pull back with the 4-5th
Forfeit make a nigga fold quick
Everybody come up in the notion
I feel like Gotti
Nigga's tourin' and them niggas ain't 'bout it
I get money and a nigga no option
Nigga talkin' and the niggas start mobbin'
I feel like Gotti
I be ridin' with the demons around me
Bugatti to McLaren, 'Rari
Roll fast, mami, just watch me
I feel like Gotti
Hundred Xans, get to lick off her body
Percocets give me sex in the lobby
Hundred trends, yeah the trends, they watchin'
I feel like Gotti
I can see it, just believe it inside me
I can see it, just believe in and ride me
Hundred trends, see a champion got this

[Chorus 1]
Thank God I got it, thank God I got it
Thank God I get how I do
Thank God I got it, thank God I got it
Thank God I get how I'm 'posed to
Thank God I got it, thank God I got it
Thank God I get how I'm 'posed to
Thank God I got it, thank God I got it
Thank God I get how I want to

We get high in this spaceship all night lay with me driving

You wanna live it how I live it whip it like a G, the chopper keep blastin' it
Chop booty, keep dancing it

Gettin' top Kawasaki
Oh yeah call me Papi
Hell they can't stop me, no way

Everybody talkin' shit can't make the hit as they go away

Talking like old way
Remember them old ways
Lock out that door-way

Rain dance, rain dancing
Rich boy, play dazing

[Chorus 2]

Only think about it, whatever we do we all in private
Keeping your thoughts beside me
Keeping your thoughts behind me

Keeping your thoughts inside me
Only think about it, whatever we do we all in private
Keeping your thoughts inside me
Keeping your thoughts behind me
