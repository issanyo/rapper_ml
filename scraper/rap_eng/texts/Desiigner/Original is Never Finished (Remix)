[Verse 1: MadeInTYO]
Ooh, gotta kick it proper
Kick back, kick back, kick it like soccer
Always do it my way, Mr. Frank Sinatra
Gotta get my check up, we ain't talkin' doctors
Ooh, yea, it ain't nothin sweet
With Adidas on your feet, you can't do it like me
Skrt skrt skrt, fly me to the moon
Sweepin up the game like a broom, cleanin' up the room
My way or the highway
Big dogs in the driveway (skrt, skrt)
Frank Sinatra, do it my way
Frank Sinatra, I always do it my way

[Verse 2: Desiigner]
I killed this
Lotta people wanna hate, lotta people feel this
Rock ya head, no Will Smith
Back to Wall Street, killin' shit
Trade a verse, get mils quick
Buy the percs, can't steal shit
I know that we be runnin' through pacific, everybody talkin' shit, I seal shit
Everybody get, everybody get dealed with
Everybody wanna point, hit em with the (GRRRAH), get killed quick
Timmy Turner had a burner
Wishing for beginner, took it to the bonus mission
On the bitches, steady sippin', steady drippin'
Ice on, ice off, steady trippin'
Everybody talkin' shit, steady gettin'
I get the money, I'm talking power
Everybody jump up in the tower
Everybody in here wearing suits
My way or the highway
I'ma drive off in my Adidas shoes
3 strikes, that's a home run
[?] give it to 'em

[Outro: Crowd of people]
Yes, there were times, I'm sure you knew
When I bit off more than I could chew
But through it all, when there was doubt
I ate it up and spit it out
I faced it all and I stood tall and did it my way
