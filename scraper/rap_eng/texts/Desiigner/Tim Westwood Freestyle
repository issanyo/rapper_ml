[Verse 1]
My niggas be mobbin all day
50 shots in the K, I let it spray
Get tackled by bullets you get in my way
My life is a game so I'm ready to play
I'm sellin' that Kumba, you sniffin' that yay
Fuck what you say cause a nigga get shot
Totin' that Glock and a nigga get popped
Now a few ops, they be snitchin' to cops
Think I'm a baby, but no I ain't Jody
Pick up that .40, put hole in your moly
The way I got two phones you think that I'm Kobe
Smokin' on dope, you call Zack and that Cody
If you got problems, I call up my broski
Fuck her so good, and your pussy get swole
Bullets hit you, and they damage your soul
This is what happen, you tell what you told
Rippin' that white like a slave on the stove
Killin' that bitch booty, now she deadass
Hundreds and thousands, I make in that cash
Smokin' on scope, and I call it that blast
She give me brain, and I'm thinkin' too fast
Hannibal Lector, I put on that mask
I'm whippin' the Jag
Grippin the Mac
And if you run, a whole clip in your ass
A bitch suck the dick while she doin' the dishes
She got a small mouth the way she be lippin'
The mack, got your boo, Scottie breathin', be Pippen
The beeper chirp, that's not an upper ignition
A nigga said you dodgin' me, is you kiddin'?
Choppa go Kuna Matata, put 2 in your noggin'
And nigga say he gonna stop me
Nigga [?], stackin', I'm prolly gettin' hard like [?]
I just be killin' shit
Hey, hey, hey

I've been grindin', man, that's day to day
4:05 pass, crash the Wraith
You be talkin' shit, I pass the bank
I be laughin' while I'm rollin' 6s
Dead man, come roll and get me
Dead man, come roll and get me
Zombie Walkin' 'til I get it on me
Moon walkin', seein' moon people
I be chillin' with the Druze people
Smokin' Jew kids, Jewish people
You be talkin' bout the news people
You be snitchin' on me, tellin' on me
I got niggas puttin' weapons on me
Tell the preacher come and preach with me
4-5, tell 'em squeeze with me
You be talkin' cold lean with me
Codeine, got lean with me
Codeine, got beams with me
Whole team got beams with me

Smokin' an eighth, put an eighth on it
Fuck yo bitch put her face on it
She be suckin' 'til she taste on it
I be like all make on it
Hey, hey, bank on it
Yeah, yeah!

I don't know what I'mma do today
Cock back, then I shoot the K
You be talkin' shit like you the jakes
Dead, dead, nigga come and get me
Rollin', 6 niggas come with me
Aye, got that new beamer
Aye, got that new beamer
Da-da-da-da-da-da new beamer
Hey, talkin' 2 hitters
I be ridin' round havin like 2 hitters
Hey, get the new beamer

You ain't got shit, no [?]
You be talkin' money...
