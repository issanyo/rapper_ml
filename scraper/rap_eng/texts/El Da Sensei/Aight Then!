[Intro][El Da Sensei talking]:
Listen. El Da Sensei. Returners. We got this project right here, called The Grown Table. Most of y'all won't understand, but when you hear the music, you gonna know. Yes, and when you hear that shit. When you come up to me, I'mma look at you and just say, hahaha, aight then
"Aight then"

[Verse One]:
Market myself as, the last of a breed
And fly a banner and flag that means I'm guaranteed
So fall back I give a warning like shots
And not the kind you receive when you visit your doc
Mush niggas in the face with my hand and bare feed back
I'm from the streets where dealers come off a G-Pack
I splurge with words to keep you interested
Time invested and rhymes so you're never neglected
Directed in scenes that's action filled
Cats appeal that will shatter shields with battlin' skills
Motion layer, rhyme sayer I'm king
Never in between only in sheets you hear the screams
And moans cause I'm known for long strokes and back shots
I push a little harder just to knock her back out
Pull an exclusive
Showin' and provin'
Cuts and usage, so track the movement

[Chorus]:
When we put it all together put the shit on smash
"Cats ain't built for this"
Every line is exact and Returners on the scratch
"On the two turntables" - MC Shan 'Marley Marl Scratch'
"Show 'em what we got" - Tha Alkaholiks 'DAAAM!'
Musically we inclined, combination intertwine
"I don't fuck around dunny" - Prodigy 'Keep It Thoro'
"This most real" - G.O.D. Part III 'We Will Survive'
Never steer you wrong, every element is strong
"The game's about to change" - The Perceptionists 'Let's Move'
"Aight then" - Big L 'Put It On'

[Verse Two]:
I chose my words wisely like Ron Isley
I write it from an age golden so your response don't surprise me
I've lively and wired up for sound
Electric when I'm selected so give me a pound
I'm lethal with no equal, bitch I spit for my people
While your whole motherfuckin' game is see through
And transparent it's apparent, I'm a beast from the east
With my signature sound that's ill over beats
Learn from the speech that's been inaugurated
Source winner made it, fuck being underrated
Dudes get in the mood in front of the stage
Rockin' line for line like they wrote it on the page
The call and response, it's all in the prompt
So follow me and get the fuck up like Pharaohe Monch
It's what you want
And necessary in your life
I'm nice despite and every time I get it right

[Chorus]:
When we put it all together put the shit on smash
"Cats ain't built for this"
Every line is exact and Returners on the scratch
"On the two turntables"
"Show 'em what we got"
Musically we inclined, combination intertwine
"I don't fuck around dunny"
"This most real"
Never steer you wrong, every element is strong
"The game's about to change"
"Aight then"
