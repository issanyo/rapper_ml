[El Da Sensei]
My characteristics be mistic, you ask who is it
Doin it, with the next type of tecs running through it
The bullshit, I mean, rap style clean
While I lean my 6 foot frame, Tame's the other being
Seeing that niggas wack, time to take it back to basics
Like saucony sneakers or a pair of Asics
Don't hate this- analyst, hip hop activist
Battle tecnician who be on a mission now listen

[Tame One]
Tame One got more grip than gore tex
I'm comin through your set like CBS
Writing my name up in your projects
Who wanna test me when I'm sess-ted
Pushing the paragraph like it's a Lexus
I come off hot like Texas
My west disrtict predicts that I'm the shit
So I walk through the bricks and shoot the gif like it's a full fifth
I bring the ruckus filling dutches with dust
I spread love like Take 6 until the whole spliff bust

[El]
We wish to diminish MC frauds who need to check
Into a rap clinic, thinking that they all in it
My message to those is right down to the core
Kick your best MC and all his niggas through the door
3-point offense, defense level's high
Stamina a hundred, leave your team ass dry

[Tame]
It's still our nature to hate ya
Play you out like Las Vegas
Cause my crew's got more game than 16 Segas
With adaptors, battling wack rappers and actors for all their stacks
And keeping my family fucked up like the Jacksons

[El]
Yo, you couldn't find my dap if you tried to use a map
Or instructions, the number ones sold, guns be bustin so
Best to recognize, eyes is on the prize
Watching for spies who want a piece of the lyrical pie

[Tame]
Crews be flippin like they really wanna die
But when I ease up, they freeze and can't look me in the eye
I got folders on the jokers who talk trash
They never walk past, cause I be checkin for they're hall pass
Haul ass and let me shine like glass do
When I die make a statue, I get in you like a tattoo
I pay homage to all the bombers that I'm fly with
Enduring politics and getting paid off of some side shit

[El]
I push niggas back who lack skills to hold their own
Jackin other brothers' styles way  that they can zone
Prone to dismantle your insides like Mickey Mantle
My form lasts long, like trick candles
You see the work of these rhyme experts
That hurt niggas in cyphers to make the other states liver
Survivors of the fittest light the graf then ASCAP
Sen-S-E-I peep the next paragraph

[Tame]
In all actu-al my style's wilder than a crack spot
I'm illin, using the putas you buildin as my backdrop
I paint a picture perfect with a thousand pencils
From the back of Continentals, Lincolns, drinkin, thinkin mental
You better look through your girl's tape collection
Cause this next subject might have a nigga second-guessing
I wanna do raps and get fat like Apache
So I can get nasty and dis a nigga like a taxi

[El]
My exquisite exhibit has facts in this specific
Most niggas boast how they represent and come with it
But whose the rudest boys, coolest with poise
Artifacts be stickin them with rhythm poise
Is on the biz, taylor skills like Liz
Tryin to save the culture, vultures wanna run the biz
You hear my voice more clear, intact
Peep the lyrics, trap my sectrets
Ill like the film called Akira
Questions, answers, brothers payin dues
MCs recognize, yo, we endin this interview
