Red Rover, Red Rover
Send Jake Palumbo over
In a Toyota Tacoma, with a Dodge Dakota motor
On The Airport Speedway
I did speed at airports
Fly as f**k, lost soul, Amelia Earhart
Raised in the backwoods, with Backwoods & beats
Handicapable - gotta take my chain off to eat
Always been a little strange
More Prince than MJ
Smoke the chalice with the Sensei from NJ
Masked avenger, toxic, sinister
I squash your mix with an Oxford Limiter
I got caught creeping with a chick named Jennifer
At the Sheraton in Maryland at a buffet dinner
SpaceLAB!!!!
In the kitchen making chicken
Jake Palumbo from the wrong side of the Mason-Dixon
Pace car piston, with a race car engineer
Carhartt & Timbs, Dale Earnhart edition, c'mon

HOOK:

Fish stay grilling, shrimp stay jumbo
You may not understand me
But I definitely ain't mumble
Off the top like we in the Royal Rumble
Gravy like gumbo, Beats By Palumbo
Catch me in an unfamiliar city rocking solo
Or the Coney Island boardwalk
Probably rocking Polo
Politic with legends, get bread with the young's
Get head from my lovers
More bread in the oven
C'mon
