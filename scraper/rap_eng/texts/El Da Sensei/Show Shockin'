[Verse 1:]
Still  in the books being proofreading pages
Turning real beautifully written toolery musically your a fool to me
JS1 spun fingertips identified we more than explosive when presentin live
You consider it golden era recorded much needed achievement
When yo crutch is well depleted a lil style to get ma jobs in
Fucka has been with asthmatic and rapmatic and action raps been torn her like tire in a hardware
Hard hat hard rap and spit fire in ralph gear a
And know you destiny be challenging in rap top talent bookings hooking up the spot
Labels represent teams that I been on 1st street performer
Now a benchwarmer is gone when yo play this at high levels
Let me get the swivel high medals and choir
(Come on y’all)

[Chorus:]
Yo let me take this shit back
Back when mic could represent never sell out who we are internationally known
(Yea Imma let yu know) (we are) world-wa-wa wide hip hop
Yo lets take this shit back sell out flows and hope to sell out shows
(We are) internationally known party rockers and show shockers of rap techniques

[Verse 2:]
I was really raised to a def jam waves
80s baby go across town back in da days
Record breaks and artist and MCs with jerry curls the freaks and deacons
Colombians and puerto ricans Special K and teddy tang
Crazy legs and rock steady heads like devious jones
Up rocker cover insted a da songs needed a beat that was ugly
Use to rub beats from thiner times Mr magic tripple flags
And chuck and norris red alert people outta control marley mall putting people to work
Uncle ralph jenkins hip-hop blacks all over divas with adidas ballies
Wallos all the caps and lumberjacks
Gucci loui bags around dey neck pouches version of rap hardcore for entertainment back in da days
Ish I wish it was that back in da day-ish

[Chorus]

[Verse 3:]
Uh Philly the illest I rap partially fae it y’all need to hang it up
Like wet laundry I turn into a giant like calypso shout out to my brother DJ Eclipse thou
He was instrumentak wen getting me this instrumental smoking
On saw shit and never say but  they meant it thou to speak got me on that
Simple type pimp flow walking up the shit show quit simple get doe
Get low dis ain’t skrillex it ain’t dip low this that crime rap innovation
Like the blind cat drama where ever I’m at Jersey
Dirty jersey wadup its your label with grey-goose spilling out the cup
Now we getting buck ask no question, about my ounce my boy DJ SOS
Come on Y’all

[Chorus]

[Instrumental]
