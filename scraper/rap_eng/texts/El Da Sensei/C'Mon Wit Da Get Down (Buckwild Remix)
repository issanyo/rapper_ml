Verse One: Tame One

I transmit the fatness over wackness
With my Campbell blunts and matches
Other rappers try to catch this
But I roast em up for practice
So act like you knew or you'll be through in your division
I've been waiting and watching for you to fuck up your position
Man listen, isn't this shit for niggas asses
Like when I flip the script pause and flick my Philly ashes
Yup, that's the status of the rappers with the cabbage
Other crews can act savage but they all fall below average
My headnaps is massive and I'm Evil like Kenivel
And I'm diesel for the sequel I'ma freak it for my people
To Gods like Bill Cos represent One Love like Nas
Thinkers rap is my job, Tame the Terror drops the bomb
On the move fakers
Now I'm stable makin papers
Ain't gon be no motherfuckers stealing bread from off my table
If I'm able
To feed those who need then proceed
But for those out for greed take heed and get these

Chorus: Busta Rhymes

I said c'mon wit da c'mon, get down with da get down
Wit da c'mon, wit da get down
C'mon wit da c'mon, get down with da get down
Artifacts and Busta Rhymes got the new sound

Verse Two: El the Sensai

This is Boom Bap, rapper annihilates the next
Ordinary gets vexed, my commentary's best
Fools who don't know the rules, be left in my dust
They come bust for what I bust, niggas figure I lust
For fame, I'm never lame, true to the game I'm needin
Brothers to be more concious or this rap shit we'll be leavin
Breathin vocab, so bad, the lyrical nomad, my son
You call me dad when I flipped and ripped your notepad
Drag brothers who rap, I snap em out position
Who be that?  Yo, listen Artifact might that be dissin
So enter the demented, thoughts of the inventor
Contenders, remember, I do you and surrender
You hear my sound usin verbs and some pronouns
Remix bound, so yo c'mon wit da get down

Chorus: Busta Rhymes

I said, c'mon wit da c'mon, get down wit da get down
C'mon wit da c'mon, get down wit da get down
C'mon, c'mon, get down wit da get down
Artifacts and Busta Rhymes got the new sound
C'mon wit da c'mon, get down wit da get down
C'mon wit c'mon, get down wit da get down
C'mon wit da c'mon, get down wit da get down
Artifacts and Busta Rhymes got the new sound

Verse Three: Busta Rhymes

Send you to deliver flows, HAH
Busta Rhymes bringin body blows, HAH
Yes when I gets busy down at my shows, YAH YAH
Gotcha breathin hard through your nose, HAH
Watch me drop you in your face with more lyrics
I love to get down but stay away from me with them mad spirits
You better believe, you're fuckin with the pros, HAH
Strike a Pose, got your body froze, HAH, hey
Sit back, relax and max with the Artifacts
Never fakin jacks black
Vocals bleeding through the entire multitrack
For adverbs I sizably leave stains on brains
And the process be gradually progress, add fuel to the flames
This ain't no games
Artifacts and Busta Rhymes are the only ones to blame
We bust your frame!!!
Put that on my name!!
Rrrrah rrrrah!! Flow it's just like water
Watch out for the hydroplane
And after I just controlled the ground
You better believe we break it down
C'mon wit da c'mon, get down when Busta bust down

Chorus: Busta Rhymes

C'mon wit da c'mon, get down with Busta bust down
C'mon wit da c'mon, Artifacts got the new sound
C'mon wit da c'mon, get down wit da get down
C'mon, wit da get down
C'mon wit da c'mon, get down wit da get down
No need to frown, c'mon wit da get down
C'mon wit da c'mon, get down wit da get down
Artifacts and Busta Rhymes got the new sound
C'mon, man get down
Wit da c'mon, c'mon wit da get down
Yes, Buckwild get down
Artifacts, Busta Rhymes get down
Hah!  C'mon, get down
C'mon wit da c'mon, get down wit da get down...
