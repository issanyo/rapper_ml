[Intro]
Not gonna tell you who on the track, figure it out for yourself
Just know that we took a long trip
Jetlag the fuck out man

[Verse 1: El Da Sensei]
In these days and times we lay the rhyme for pay
And my hayday switch [?] any given day
Ask what's [?] in this rap game bullshit
Make you niggas feel when i comply like a bullet
Sensei young I die with the bullet style up in your grill piece
Release my rap sheet in a daily stroll
Giving out a toll you gotta pass
Before you enter my class [?] if you got the jazz

[Verse 2: Mike Zoot]
Advancing through the forefront
My line designs
The next coming, stopping, go
I keep something more live
Driving new nikes ten [?]
Silver [?] aerodynamic design
Switching to timbs like new rims
Sliding out superfly
Holding my two-seat neat
And all you bitches want to ride
You'll never take my pride
Niggas die so I can get money
Lounging living lovely
Lounging living lovely

Turning whole tables, lay [?] in coffins
Spitting, stay talking, rocking the awkward stance
Glancing at your [?] benz

Tight pans with (?) young girl [?]
We bring hot shit, who got the [?] shit
Conglamorate with etiquette

Brick city [?] cream
Catching honeys like [?]
