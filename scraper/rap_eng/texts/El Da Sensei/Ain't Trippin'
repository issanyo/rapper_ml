[Verse One] [El Da Sensei]:
We cop it off and blast, brag with slang editorial
Man they never called you when the loot becomes recordable
Audible pro I smash lines into winery
Locked in the booth with the neighbors is where you find me
Trippin' from days back, but now I'm futuristic
2009 still thrill with linguistics
Dwell underneath in the thick of the beat
Pick up your feet and wake you from your slumbering sleep
Pummel the weak and spit like street sweepers in broad day
Spit it the hard way like Cosby on an off day
Crazed and throw it together in a better context
Always brand new like the cat who ain't signed yet
Rhyme vet, in shape like cardio in the gym
Heartless with the pen, regardless who you send
Tim, Socks and me, together we team
Blowin' off steam, Returners you know the routine

[Chorus]
Cats wanna front on the name
"I ain't trippin'"
I'mma keep showin' up on the bill so deal with it
Heat rocks still kickin' my dude
"I ain't trippin'"
Cock back, hot raps and you know we got that

We keep a rappers feet to the flames
"I ain't trippin'"
Packin' with capacity crowds so stay flippin'
"I ain't trippin'"
"No, I'm not playin' with ya"

[Verse Two] [Ghettosocks]:
Dude, I'm not trippin', your tunes are not hittin'
The Sock spittin', clock chicks gin on the rocks sippin'
My Pulp Fiction will knock you out the box limpin'
And hot writtens, clown kids like Robot Chicken
My clique's bangin' like chip wagons packed with ?
We called your blog "Raw Dawg" and crashed the server
Enthusiasm curber, we'll smash your promo
Playin' hot potato with your head and catch a murder
After I lash out I'm sewing your eyelids
Fly shit, burn your retinas and fill up your mind quick
I call your chick Dell cause she's building a virus
That'll cast away your friends like on Gilligan's Island
Look, even your mom loves to see this kid rhyme
But when you free I actually see the stink lines
I'm three to six times, easily this big time
Cause to crush they A game I never need to bring mine

[Chorus]
We keep a rappers feet to the flames
"I ain't trippin'"
Packin' with capacity crowds so stay flippin'
"I ain't trippin'"

Cats wanna front on the name
"I ain't trippin'"
I'mma keep showin' up on the bill so deal with it
Heat rocks still kickin' my dude
"I ain't trippin'"
Cock back, hot raps and you know we got that
"No, I'm not playin' with ya"
