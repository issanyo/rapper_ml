[Verse One] [Sean Price]:
Get rich quick scam
Lick dick bitch scram
Bastards to biscuits
Oh shit, flip bam!
Bam Margera
Hanna Barbera
Death metal leather jacket on Pantera
Grand era, Grand Old Oppy
Grand standin'
Evel Knievel jumped 'cross the damn Grand Canyon
Last Man Standin'
Bruce Willis step cock
Next movie off point, fuckin' Mos Def shot
Body in the truck been there for two days
So the car drive by with the boomin' human
Check in the mail like Newman
Hahaha, get it
Checkin' the male like Newman
(Yeah I got it I got it)
Duke you rappin' like Rappin Duke
The Da Ha Da Ha, bitch nigga scratch your boot
That's when the right hand froze thinkin'
"How much coke did I sniff with a ? nose"
That's more than a little bit
Calcium deprived because mommy got little tits
Down south niggas listen to Lil' Flip
Up north niggas listen to Lil' Fame
(M.O.P.)
We both listen to Lil' Wayne
We takin' your little chain

[Scratch Hook]:
"Everyday in the street" - Nas 'Nastradamus'
"Same shit different day, but still the same"
"It's most real" - G.O.D. Part III 'We Will Surive'
"In da hood"
"Everyday and all day" - A.G
"Always the same" - Gang Starr 'Discipline'

[Verse Two] [Bekay]:
I come from a place where we play off cops but the bitches fuck from free
Suck and pluck you duckin' me, get stuck and bleed, Brooklyn's ugly
Uhh, even the ad-libs stab kids
And find your body parts chopped up in a bag like spare ribs
Walkin' around like a zombie
Talk of the town, stalkin' em now
Chasin', slowly Jason, walk calmly
Brooklyn gully, lookin' ugly, pull jooks we hungry
My man got caught, the judge threw the book at money
Now he doin' 23 and 1, never see the sun
Plus he never see his son and that's fucked up
A bitter craps, spit a fact
Tough talk? Get rid of that
Your girl gave so much head we nicknamed her "fitted cap"
Dudes will hustle outside your condominium
They flip more rocks than a pissed off Palestinian
You get clapped dead if I wanna
But that ain't a mac it's just an Atari I bought off the crackhead on the corner
Brooklyn!

[Scratch Hook]:
"Everyday in the street"
"Same shit different day, but still the same"
"It's most real"
"In da hood"
"Everyday and all day"
"Always the same"

[Verse Three] [El Da Sensei]:
Niggas we movin' off the block like we pitchin' hand in hand
Slots takin' by man to man
Combat that's on demand
H.D
Hot demographics, ?
Killer beats that make me
And there's more that's given lately
So, at your service ?
Electrify like third rails and tunes that never fail
By request y'all niggas call on me
With the chemistry that's built since 1993
Lavishly I dress the rhymes to coincide
With the foremost sound, get you aroused and polarized
Now things change and the flows got sicker
Delivery's slick and the tracks are more thicker
Start where we left off
And reincarnate
The all star quota that many seen as a lost art
Sean, Bekay and me
Out of this trifeful
Songs that cause spite and shooters wanna snipe you
{gunshot}

[Scratch Hook]:
"Everyday in the street"
"Same shit different day, but still the same"
"It's most real"
"In da hood"
"Everyday and all day"
"Always the same"
