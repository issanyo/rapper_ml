[Chorus]
C'mon wit da c'mon, git down wit da git down
C'mon wit da c'mon, git down wit da git down
C'mon wit da c'mon, git down wit da git down
C'mon wit da c'mon, git down wit da git down

[Verse 1: El Da Sensai]
C'mon and get down with that Artifacts sound
Where kids get wreck and, the beat's bound to pound
We're strolling through the industry, B
See we gotta be, the next shit that kicks, cause brothers ain't got it
In this rap shit, ain't no time for the dilly-dally
Pally throw a match in the Gasoline Alley
Blew up mad spots, kids was jealous for the props
See the shit never stops, hops, just looking for my dillz-knot
Styles relate, never fake, broke breaks in every crate
Old freestyles and dirty ass copied-over tapes
Notify that; the Artifacts never slack
While crews is on stage wack, we just play the back
Now, the flip tripper ripper slits ya wit da mixture
All crews, who never paid dues, watch it 'fore I get ya
Cause nowadays, it's da ways, of da underground
But they're wack now, so c'mon wit da git down

[Chorus]
C'mon wit da c'mon, git down wit da git down
C'mon wit da c'mon, git down wit da git down
C'mon wit da c'mon, git down wit da git down
C'mon wit da c'mon, git down wit da git down

[Verse 2: Tame One]
You know the stacks, if not, then ask some niggas who heard of me
The half on the Artifacts in Jersey
Cause brothers be buggin', not givin' love to the nuccas
Sayin' fuck us, cause we be shinin' brighter than the suckers
Shootin' me prison nobody listens to your dissin'
Cause, yo, my shit's legit and as a lyricist I'm hittin'
The high notes, so why don't, I smile when I take pictures?
Cause now that I rock I got more niggas on my jock than bitches
I just wanna do my jams with fams and slam into some hypeness
But biters and backstabbin' rappers don't even like us
But props due, peep The Source, Rap Pages and the Billboard
And read about the tours while you be flappin' your jaws
I freak techniques, cause talk is cheaper than beepers from Broad Street
Punks pop junk, Tame and Da Sensai leave em all beat
So peep how deep my technique freaks and how my shit sounds
C'mon wit da c'mon, git down wit da git down

[Chorus]
C'mon wit da c'mon, git down wit da git down
C'mon wit da c'mon, git down wit da git down
C'mon wit da c'mon, git down wit da git down
C'mon wit da c'mon, git down wit da git down

[Verse 3: El da Sensai]
Hold up, you rap sucker duck, buck, the track's rough enough
To prove a point, that the niggas is the joint
Magazines where we're seen, now pop the tape in your deck
I got the Heavy Ammunition cuz I'm Flexi Wit Da Tech
Niggas, can't believe the Artifacts achieve
Got, tricks up my sleeve so bow down on your knees
Yo, we ain't got the same lame, ordinary plain game
Put to shame any crew who wants to feel the flame
So bring submission to the rap recognition
My right hand is itching from the shit that I'm scripting
So pass the baton, to the next runner up, Tame
I give a pound so, c'mon wit da git down

[Tame One]
Aiyyo, word to my grandma's tampons, I drop bombs, but since
Our demo tracks had gaps some said my fat raps was half-assed
Watchin' others rock and clock we shocked em like a robot
With our props, so now the Notty Head Niggas got more knots yo
My pockets are lumpy, chump, my drunk style is trunky
Dunk my disc in crisp, put funk in funk like Humpty Hump
Cuz I'm comin' from the underground I'm down wit da git down
MC's who used to diss us, get pissed cause they ain't shit now
The Artifacts, represent on every stage we step on
The days of gettin slept on, are dead because we keep on
Peepin these weak MC's, who cheese with their bologny
Cause they're phony as fuck, and couldn't pull shit off of tow trucks
So yo bro, now you know my flow so go and sit down
Or c'mon wiv da c'mon, git down wit da git down

[Chorus]
C'mon wit da c'mon, git down wit da git down
C'mon wit da c'mon, git down wit da git down
C'mon wit da c'mon, git down wit da git down
C'mon wit da c'mon, git down wit da git down
