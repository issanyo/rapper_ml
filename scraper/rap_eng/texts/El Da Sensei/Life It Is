"There's one life to live, so live it the best you can" - Nas 'Classic'

[Verse One]:
All aboard this is for the hardcore
Flossin', uninsured, uninspired coke jaw
Many tales of that
Goin' through the madness
Yester year is fear, speak of days when we had this
Shit, locked and sewn, before the Patron
It was easier to get on with the skills and the song
Now, don't get me wrong I got my tales too
But since I first started my job was not to fail you
But nowadays your best rappers can't get deals
Albums don't drop, that's when shit is real
Warning signs flash and your life does too
For the rent you gotta scramble just to make due
With no bookin' agent, you'll have to go for self
Tours and features, put some shit on the shelf
Merch table, turntable to please your fan base
To continue motivation, not comin' in last place

[Hook]:
And it's the life it is
We all got one life to live
"You never succeed or progress
Searchin' for peace through material objects" - I.N.I. 'Fakin' Jax'
"And you know what?"
It's the life it is
We all got one life to live
"It's one life to live" - Nas 'Classic'
"In this life" - Gang Starr 'In This Life'
"It's war, I want it all man, nothings enough" - Inspectah Deck 'The Raw'

[Verse Two]:
The younger audience is foolish when they breakin' the rules
Disrespectful to the laws that we learned from school
Peers and their elders, appear to be in shambles
Careers they can't handle, even with new samples
It's steady dying down and it's gettin' dumber
Many now wonder why artists been losing numbers
Supply and demand is no longer the disc
Cause now the ringtone exists and replace what you missed
Now it's all digitized
Streamlined, even podcasts
More publishin' for Internet cash
Small dudes think it all about the ignorant and rude
Gun talk, tough shit, tryin' to eat your food
And new ways of beats disguised by Pro Tools
And Fruity Loops, but the soul has no proof
Of being hot my nigga
So sign for readmitting time
From a school of writtens and I'm givin' free admission

[Hook]:
And it's the life it is
We all got one life to live
"You never succeed or progress
Searchin' for peace through material objects"
"And you know what?"
It's the life it is
We all got one life to live
"It's one life to live"
"In this life"
"It's war, I want it all man, nothings enough"

[Verse Three]:
What is the outcome?
Who has the resolution?
Searchin' for retribution
To start a revolution
Many think it's unfair and they can't bare
To hear the bullshit they servin' on the air
Never compare these times with the shit that leaked
Most people agree, so we propose sequels
To keep it in tact while other acts ruin it
Pleasure to the ear when the writers are reviewin' it
Publicity and other intricacies
And most noted through the industry when shit is promoted
DVDs and a host of compilation CDs
Of "Best Of" for a buzz when you're in it like me
An extra edge and we all got priors
Past record deals and I still got buyers
This could be you if you're showin' longevity
Follow my melody and you'll be steps ahead of me

[Hook]:
And it's the life it is
We all got one life to live
"You never succeed or progress
Searchin' for peace through material objects"
"And you know what?"
It's the life it is
We all got one life to live
"It's one life to live"
"In this life"
"It's war, I want it all man, nothings enough"
