[Intro]
Yeah, Yeah
Here we go
Jersey stand up
A 7 Heads presentation
El Da Sensei
All y'all just relax
Sit back, take a drink
1,2

[Verse 1]
Yo, take a step inside the booth
With no BET films documentin' the proof
No twangs in my slang cause I come from the east
Known for heatin' hot-ass beats and bullets from the beast
I'm just one of many and I'm here to unleash
My presentation as a piece of myself to eat
7 Heads is the label and I rep that shit
Musical magic, fantastic, on the average
My rendition of the classics, rendition of the last true and livin'
But alas my edition on arrival
Logical, melodical
Trying to get the fans and more cash and respect that's possible
Straight up, I got the early 90's flow
Slam upon tracks like Booker T on Monday Nitro
You fiend for my taste like puttin' fingers in the cake mix
Rock off kicks and harmonize like Take 6

[Hook] Repeat 2x
Relax, think
Back, when shit was fat
Relax, Relate, Remember
Not long ago when we all knew what was the agenda

Debate this in any presidential candidate
I spit great from the BX to the Great Lakes
Dedicate this to my dad who past
And to all my late relatives from years past
To my son: God Bless, you relieve my stress
Keep me striving for the best in this industry mess
It's true to the fact that I'm not like ya'll
Cause we Tom Hill Billy niggas tryin' to ball
"What happened to the sound?" what everbody's askin'
Guns clappin', top emcees clashin'
Well fuck that, real tracks at your service
No need to get nervous as you get into the verses
Natural exceptional... enough about myself
If it ain't about myself, then it ain't nothin' else
So Relax is the title, El Da Sen' online
Mark off your favorite joints then press rewind

[Hook] Repeat 2x
Relax, think
Back, when shit was fat
Relax, Relate, Remember
Not long ago when we all knew what was the agenda

[Outro]
Like I said before
El Da Sensei
Relax everybody
I got you
Just sit back
Enjoy the music
Just remember when we was doin' everything in the 90's
And the 80's
Yeah, yeah...
