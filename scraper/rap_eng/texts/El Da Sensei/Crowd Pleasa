[Intro}
This land is mine, God gave this land to me
This brave and ancient land to me
And when the...
Pop
Uh
Hot shit
Pop shit
Uh yeah
C'mon
One, two, oh, oh, oh
Wooo
Yeah
Mm

[V1]
Now when the pen hits the pad
Things start happening
Major freak of nature
All pro for splattering
My chattering is patterned
Disease is what I greed
In excess of trees -
A lavish home is all I need
Oh
The so exquisite prolific gent
Is here to present
My testament at all closed-circuit events
Respect the essence and build on my landfill
I'm so ill like the film, "Time To Kill" real

To real service for clarity in its best form
Above the norm but to my culture stay sworn
To my duties in-laws
To Refresh all y'all
With the greatest of songs that can never go wrong
To the next now
Back and forth realizing
What you been missin' in lyrical exercising
It's no surprising that I'm bringing the goods
Swinging the wood like Pujols
Prepare for a new host

[Chorus]
Crowd pleasa register off the meter
You know the business
Keep it live
[?]
I'm transmittin live with the hardcore style
X2

[V2]
Focus Daily
My platform's stacked with choice invoice
Strapped with a vocal approach considered moist

Duncan hines rhymes
Brownie points for the incline
I'm inclined to dip your whole shine
Tarnished your garments, pop your ornaments
Slice your spinners
And embarrass you in tournaments
Don't forget when I first stepped on the scene
The boisterous, glorious
Furious with a scheme of themes

Lethal in fact
Styles come in stacks of tens
Infamous like tapes from Backspin

Captain of the ship
Buckaroo banzai
Master of the sword like Li Mu Bai
In it for the cash, and the flash, and the gusto
Must flow impressively to rake in the dough
Take it all in breathe and stop
Take a minute to reflect as I take it from the top

[Chorus]
Crowd pleasa register off the meter
You know the business
Keep it live
[?]
I'm transmittin live with the hardcore style
X2

[V3]
I'm headed for the Triple Crown
World renowned
All purpose for the sprint
Breakin shit up into fragments
The dude, quick to eat up your food
And rude manners
Kill?? with my daily planner
The unflappable, hard like granite
Granted with the gift that'll spread across the planet
Lace the future with sound like '89
'99 the last year hip hop had it's time
(true dat)

Advertise myself, but never dramatize
Like Homicide. Some will rise on my social life
I'm well-spoken like speakers at charities
Narratives that'll give pop off and shattering
(woo)
Straight action packed jumping through windows
Car bombs and hoes and beats that explode

[Chorus]
Crowd pleasa
Register off the meter
You know the business
Keep it live
[?]
I'm transmittin live with the hardcore style

Crowd pleasa
Register off the meter
You know the business
Keep it live
