[Verse One] [El Da Sensei]:
I burn more than L's but
Walls and stairwells
With the broadest of markers and colors they can't sell
Caps of many kinds and styles and hand skills
Straightest of lines and characters hard to build
Sketch pro pad, merchant workin' and it shows
Back drop is life like with cans it flows
Portraits are scorchin' and blends are important
Energy surrounds all burners puttin' thought in
Color wheel drill with the face so crisp
Flow master tools complete the outfit
Rubber gloves and masks
Fumes from the past
And it's still relevant and evident from the tag
Brag on my Wild Style ? not a secret
Wrong Side the first hit, in '94 we leaked it
New era for bombin' and always be the shit so
Toys get in line for brand new starter kits

[Verse Two] [Skit Slam]:
Yo, I wanna thank the Bronx for the hip hop invention
The music, the breakin' that got everyone attention
My backspin's longer than a pen life sentence
Wave lockin' and bendin', create new inventions
Strike a pose air flare, one arm extending
Apple Jacks on your head and start spinnin'
Head glide, suicide and leg swipes
You had to practice day and night to get nice
I used to up rock, for money at the bus stops
At least I wasn't tryin' to hustle at the drug spot
Who remember Puma sweat suits and Adidas?
Fat laces to make your footwork the neatest
Pull out the cardboard
There's none around?
Well let's get busy on the hard floor
I'm thinkin' 'bout the moves that bring chills
Moonwalkin'
Nah, windmills
No hands, if you advanced with skill
Battle while the DJ on the wheels of steel
It's all love though
B-Boys and B-Girls are brethren
And show mad love to hip hop legends

[Verse Three] [Cymarshall Law]:
Ayo man up brother
I speak with enough power to chain lightening bolts and handcuff thunder
When I, use the mic to control the crowd
An MC, never phoney, a master of ceremony
Somethin' always been inside and nobody had ever told me homie
I was born to lead and teach youth
Study the culture and it's deep roots
It's my job to, get on the mic and speak truth
Yo, honesty the policy
For a top MC it gotta be
Speak from your heart without apology
I use every second to flee to show you
Even if you're not ready to see the rebel in me
The difference is
When you rock, the crowd evaporate
But I can take a rowdy bunch and show you how to captivate
The voice of the people, speak truly is my duty
And whoever you be, know you can't do nothin' to me
