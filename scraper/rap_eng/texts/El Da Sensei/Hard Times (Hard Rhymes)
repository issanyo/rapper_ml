[Verse One: El Da Sensei]
In my lifetime I write the rhyme bent at most times
Walk the street with iron cleats relying on beats to keep me signed
Some ghetto fab' label
Where thugs tell their fables and their drug warfare
Guerrilla combat affair
Truth or dare share similar tales
That compare to street poetry
They armed to do harm, slowly
Keep a watchful eye for stick up Tri's guys you thought was fly
Plot your downfall to reach the sky
No trust in this game, only lust jealousy plus shame
How many cats you know by their first name?
Address change, weekly fiends on arrival
Raise your right hand
Swear that you do it just for survival
Undeniable ends become vital, idle chat
Potential weaponry
No doubt, you gotta cop a gat
I've never been a player
But I never warmed the bench
Street wise resident
Never hesitant to represent

[Hook: El Da Sensei] {x2}
Hard times, hard crimes
I roam through the city that's star evidence
Street smart from the start
(How's that?)
Through my rap
(Who ya be?)
Sensei
(Where ya at?)
In The Bricks, home of the car jack

[Verse Two: El Da Sensei]
I walk the path of the wise
Ever corner's downsized
The price of shit get's high
And to all is no surprise
Make the scrabble
B.I. gets handle
All on board, baller supreme
Fuck a dollar and a dream
Entourage is large
Boss hog in charge
Bling bling, neck and wrist plus the pinky ring god
What I've just explained is your average cat
Who never lasts
Check the jail rate, peep the facts
I can go on for days, you know how the shit ends
On the run till you're caught trying to hide out with your friends
Mad niggas involved till your case gets solved
You know the game ain't the same, justice system has evolved
Three strikes no if's or mights
No court fight for spite
Three hots and a cot, same food every night
I preach my words with the force for all many souls lost
Willing to sacrifice honorable at any cost

[Hook]

[Verse Three: El Da Sensei]
Hey young world
Grimy cats, rats, boy and girls
Hard life, trife times and just one swirl
It's hard in these streets, we hear the struggle everyday
Trying to eat, make ends meet, legal or the other way
Brothers say I'm down for mine
Purchase the shine
But don't own no homes or have some kind of piece of mind
In a long line of success brothers settle for less
Trying to impress the same cat who warned you just to wear a vest

[Hook] {x2}
