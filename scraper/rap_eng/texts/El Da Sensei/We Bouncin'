[Verse One]
Wake up to the alarm, about five in the morn'
Crack of dawn and I'm yawning but the show goes on
Packed my bags last night cause we catching a flight
To a town near you just to rock the mic
Hitting Kaos on the line, making sure he's awake
He called me at the same time, "Yo, you ready to skate?"
"Hell yeah." Take a stretch then
Hit up West and Lamont for the info, scramble for a pencil
And jot down airports, airline, air time
E ticket, no standing in line
Get dressed grab my passport, I'm ready to step
Meet my crew at the gate to blow your sound set

[Verse Two]
We airborn
Take a pause to bless
The rest of our flight cause I'm not ready to die yet
Jet across the stream no matter the team
Better rhyme schemes and brown to keep the sound clean
Stewardess hit me with a bag of nuts and a Coke half cup
And 'gnac to ease me up
I'm all good, but I'm kinda nervous and tense
Cause of today's events and this damn turbulence
Stomach wilding out from that entree, fake ass filet
Plus this kid is making noise the whole way
Before you knew it, yo we almost there
Swooping down in your city, spread love in the air
Exit the main gate then I look for a sign
That reads El Da Sensei, yo you ready to rhyme?
We go

[Verse Three]
Hit the hotel, drop off the bags for the sound check
All vinyl kid, show some respect
Correct with the replay
With new songs to say
Old to the now, show how the style pay
Mad dues just to bring it to you
Practice makes perfect, I'm here for a purpose
Messenger with the style flagrant
Make the crowd get aroused any way you wanna say this
Lights, backdrops and opening acts
Snatch up the promoter when it's time for snaps
