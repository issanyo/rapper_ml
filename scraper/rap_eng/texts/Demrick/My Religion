[Hook]
I’m on a mission
To go from racks to riches
Got a ride from so-and-so
Just get in where you fit in
Lost along the way ‘cause they made a bad decision
Don’t judge how I’m living, nigga, this is my religion
This is my religion

Lot of money, lot of weed
Break it down, spread it to the family
(This is my religion)
All praise the getting paid
Want forever green like the everglades
(This is my)


[Verse 1]
I got those type of dreams that you can’t take away
I’ve seen my nightmares right in broad day
I’ve seen the better side of light too
But they don’t want you to stay when they invite you
So I’m on a mission. Here’s my proposition
Crush all competition. They ain’t got the vision
Oh they hate when you ain’t got a pot to piss in
They never listen, but they love you where your Bronx’s glisten
Fame’s a drug
Fame’s a drug
How’d you let it fuck you up? You barely caught a buzz
In God we trust
Caught in lust
It don’t matter how much you get, that shit is not enough
They want lock us up, throw away the key
If you ain’t talking ATM then I got ADD
Hit the streets, play for keeps, here to eat
I never starve where these other niggas feast

I’m on a mission
To go from racks to riches

Lost along the way ‘cause they made a bad decision
Don’t judge how I’m living, nigga, this is my religion
This is my religion

Lot of money, lot of weed
Break it down, spread it to the family
(This is my religion)
All praise the getting paid
Want forever green like the everglades
(This is my)


[Verse 2]
I asked for better days then out in here
Look in the mirror, say a prayer
I hope God’ll hear
Money makes the proudest disappear
Want to pay, I’ve guessed the ways I’ll 365 out the year
Yeah, ride like a deer
Getting high as I sear
Through the city, niggas with me keeping eyes on the rear
I prepare for anything. Cheefing on that Mary Jane
Seen niggas with everything
Go and throw it all away
And it’s my idea of reality
Double my work then double my salary
Contract killer when I get up on these beats
Roll a tree. You get a contact high sitting next to me
Thank God for blessings I receive
My pedigree is G
We’re a different breed
Take care of the family
Got to be the man for me to hold on to my sanity
