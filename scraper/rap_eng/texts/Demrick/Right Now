I'ma, I'ma wile out. We live a crazy lifestyle
Any competition go against us, lights out
We gon', we gon' shut shit down before they brings the mics out

[Verse 1] Demrick
No love for the fake here
Big blessing for a great year
Any test and they'll play fair
Turn blue, dream and the night tears
Tan it out, no sunlight glare
Rent it out, park it right their
Send it out over night air
Then we smoke it all, what do I care?
Niggas hating, why do I care?
Taking shots to get blocked here
Pull her down to the side-chair
She know I beat that pussy like a box-set
Money making while the clock tick
Rowdy boys like the mosh pit
Ripped jeans, I'ma rock shit
But still get paid when I pop shit
Let's get it

Stuntin' on 'em, that's an X Game. Alexander Ovechkin
I saw me, all the ice on me
Game colder than your ex think
But next thing from the east-side
East-side where the nets play
And baby girl need a scholarship, 'cause baby girl give the best brain

[Demrick]
Bottle service, call me De Henny
Whole club smell like weed heavy
Pocket watchers counting each penny
Any problems, yeah we ready
Bitches rubbing on their G-spot
Niggas living by the G-code
Vibe higher than the treetops
Shut down shit everywhere we go
And you know

And that faker shit is out, all my paper rock
While these niggas get it for the clock
