[Verse 1] Demrick
You see, time is of the essence
Gotta make ‘em feel my presence
So I’m counting up my money and my blessings
Momma stressing, will I ever learn my lesson
My confession, all this pain I hold inside
Feel my rise with a vengeance
Man’s henchmen
Tip burn like an extension
Smoke away the tension
Fifth dimension, mind bended
We invested lives in this
This is do or die
You or I, like who am I, kidding
I’ll put my life in these songs
That’s all that makes a difference
I’ve been gone so long
Just hold on ‘till I’m finished
‘Till my bread is gone
Or I’m dead and gone from existence
I need assistance
I’ve been in the trenches gaining interest
Write my life in a sentence, so get a life sentence
No plan B, I don’t see my family
Watch the Grammy’s to understand what it can be
I searched for hope with these folks but I’m getting antsy
Let my dreams romance me
My flow nasty


[Hook]
You know me nigga, don’t ask me why
Let me smoke my weed, I’m trying to touch the sky
All this shit a nigga sacrifice
Living this life, don’t let it pass you by

Caught in this game I’m in and I know it
Just pray I can keep this shit going
All this shit a nigga sacrifice
Living this life, don’t let it pass me by


[Verse 2] Demrick
See, minutes turn to hours, turn to days, turn to months
Live up for giving
Turn my vision to everything I want
From the baggies in the blunts
To the mic in the stage
Rather spend nights in a road then my life in a cage
Before I say goodbye to my soul, living life like a slave
I light a J, catch a wave, record my life to be played
‘Cause when I’m not here they lying how I got here
The proof is in the songs. Sing along, it becomes clear
Thought it would take one year, turned into a long road
Turn me to a lost soul. Hunger is colossal
My 60’s gasoline cover, no Vaseline
Fuck from no rubber, son and father
They style, but don’t love ‘em
Come from nothing, project baby mid-eighties
My motive by the Slim Shady
I’m a bit crazy
Hands up
Let me see you stand up a breath
‘Cause this life’s like Russian Roulette


[Hook]
You know me nigga, don’t ask me why
Let me smoke my weed, I’m trying to touch the sky
All this shit a nigga sacrifice
Living this life, don’t let it pass you by

Caught in this game I’m in and I know it
Just pray I can keep this shit going
All this shit a nigga sacrifice
Living this life, don’t let it pass me by


[Verse 3] Emilio Rojas
I’m waking up in the night with my sweat dripping
Feeling kind of nauseous
Now my room and head spinning and worried my stress winning (ah)
Momma calling tripping said my sisters in the hospital
6 months pregnant. It’s got to be impossible
Lately I don’t got more opportunities and obstacles
So hell yeah I’m going to stay positive
‘Cause we just got a little recognition
We fall for these positions
But some fights about the blood
It gets spilled and now who winning
I’m swinging, for the fences
And maybe the way that I’m living is really my reasons, for my blessings
But everyone got an opinion and I don’t need them
So don’t mention, ‘cause y’all ain’t in my situation
And you don’t see what I’m feeling whether the shit I’m facing
Motherfuckers is shady, man
Real piece of shit
Stab you in the back with the same fork that you feed them with
Nowadays it’s only my family that I’m eating with
And I don’t give a fuck who agree with it


[Hook]
You know me nigga, don’t ask me why
Let me smoke my weed, I’m trying to touch the sky
All this shit a nigga sacrifice
Living this life, don’t let it pass you by

Caught in this game I’m in and I know it
Just pray I can keep this shit going
All this shit a nigga sacrifice
Living this life, don’t let it pass me by
