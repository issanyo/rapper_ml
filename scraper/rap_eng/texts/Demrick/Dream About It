[Verse 1]
It's gettin' late
Fill it, fill it up to the top
To the top, to the top
I realize I only got this shot
One shot left
So girl, this might be the liquor talking
Ayee-eh-ayee

But girl I think me and you
Me and you, should fuck tonight
For the night
I'll be yours, you'll be mine
For the night, for the night
I'll be yours, you'll be mine
For the night...

[Hook]
What you think about it?
Think about it? Think about it?
Make you dream about it
Dream about it, dream about it

What you think about it?
Think about it? Think about it?
Make you dream about it
Dream about it, dream about it

[Verse 2]
You got a body, a body just like an athlete
Like Serena, Serena, you got the backseat
Yeah you run it, you run it just like a track meet
Don't need no competition to beat out my oppositions
Want that top position, 'cause you like that power
Them bottles pop, call it champagne showers
Make it last for hours, 'til that sun come up rising girl
Let's keep it exiting girl

Let's fuck tonight
For the night
I'll be yours, you'll be mine
Let's fuck tonight
For the night
I'll be yours, you'll be mine
Mine, mine, mine, mine

[Hook]
What you think about it?
Think about it? Think about it?
Make you dream about it
Dream about it, dream about it

What you think about it?
Think about it? Think about it?
Make you dream about it
Dream about it, dream about it

[Verse 3]
What you got on your mind? I would love to pick it
Can we kick it, what you got from behind, that's your golden ticket
What's your position, I'll pick it
For a minute of your time
Baby, am I out of line when I say that ass is fine?
You want another wine? I'll take a Henny on the rocks
Hey bartender, can we get a couple more shots?
Oh, it's two o'clock, gotta go, but aye, do you wanna roll?
Back to my spot on the low, let me know

[Hook]
What you think about it?
Think about it? Think about it?
Make you dream about it
Dream about it, dream about it

What you think about it?
Think about it? Think about it?
Make you dream about it
Dream about it, dream about it

What you think about it?
Think about it? Think about it?
Make you dream about it
Dream about it, dream about it

What you think about it?
Think about it? Think about it?
Make you dream about it
Dream about it, dream about it
