[Verse 1]
Apartment babies. Me and my brother and sister
Mom's was working relentless, living on public assistance
Pizza parties thanks to Papa Johns and seven food stamps
"I don't care if your friends get to go out late, boy, but you can't."
And when my step pops actually came around it felt like boot camp
So I bounced out at fourteen, yeah, I had a new plan
Everything from selling crack to stolen cars
Thinking back on that was no facade
I was living like there wasn't no tomorrow
That feel-less feeling before the fall
Moved in with twin sisters, they was twenty
Both had money
I was fifteen lying 'bout my age, in them days I'd say anything like a dummy
It was funny
For my birthday, Mom's put sixteen candles on the cake
I told her, "Hold up, wait. She think I'm turning eighteen, please don't go blow my spot today!"
She said, "Boy, I'm not gon' lie for you. If she don't ask then I won't tell."
I found out family gon' ride for you even if you put 'em all through hell..
And I definitely put them all through hell
But I grew up to be a better man, yeah
Time do tell

[Hook]
Came a long way

I came a long way, aye
I came a long way
I came a long way, aye
I came a long way
I came a long way, aye
I came a long way
I came a long way, aye

I came a long way
I came a long way, aye
I came a long way
I came a long way, aye
I came a long way
I came a long way, aye
I came a long way

[Piano break]

[Verse 2]
Twenty now working two jobs, rapping on the side
This time around I'ma do it different, I've made up my mind
Had a couple girls along the way say they down for the ride
But nothing ever really lasted us to detest the time
Those with the best of times, we was all broke and everybody was cool with it
Crashed on the couch at the homie's house, went to high school with him
He was the first one to say, "Yo, we could do this music shit for real, If you keep your ass out the streets long enough to get a record deal."
And we chased that dream six years straight, ever moved out to L.A. off pure fate?
Didn't work out, went our own ways. Ain't seen him in years since just the other day
He said, "I don't even rap no more." Told him that I just got back off tour
Said he was happy I got everything I was asking for, and that I came a long way

[Hook]
Came a long way

I came a long way, aye
I came a long way
I came a long way, aye
I came a long way
I came a long way, aye
I came a long way
I came a long way, aye

I came a long way
I came a long way, aye
I came a long way
I came a long way, aye
I came a long way
I came a long way, aye
I came a long way
