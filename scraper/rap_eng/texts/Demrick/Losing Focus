[Hook]

I'm Losing focus
These walls are closing in, I didn't notice
This weed i'm smoking
Makes me feel like waves are crashing down around me

These waves is crashing down
These waves, These waves, These waves is crashing down (x2)

[Verse 1]

Bong water ocean blue
Moved out to Cali just for the view
The weed came with and the bitches came too
It was low tide when I walked in
Before I knew it I was waste deep
I thought we on the same team, chasing the same dream
Till the water started rising up
Times got tough
Niggas started talking shit
I'm like shit
What the fuck should I do?
Should I go with the crew or stand on my own two?
Do what another man said I won't do
Grab the rolls now I roll in the old school
Smoke a dro, fucking hoes like i'm supposed to
Doing shows, gettin' dough like you won't do

I light it up to be free
Livin' in 3D, off this weed


[Hook]

I'm Losing focus
These walls are closing in, I didn't notice
This weed i'm smoking
Makes me feel like waves are crashing down around me

These waves is crashing down
(These waves, These waves, These waves is crashing down) x2

[Verse 2]

I wanna take another hit and just chill
It's coming down like rain on my windshield
When the cup fills over then it's gon' spill
But i'm never gonna let it break a niggas will
In the 25th hour, standing in the middle of a downpour
It's 420 on board
Cause we on course
Headed on an underwater expedition
Niggas wouldn't listen when I said I wasn't fishin'
I crush all the competition
They was on another tip, I was on some other shit
Rollin' up another spliff just for the fuck of it
Just cause i'm in love with it

And I can't let go
To the trees I smoke
I get it by the O
It's amazing
So

I light it up to be free
Livin' in 3D, off this weed


[Hook]

I'm Losing focus
These walls are closing in, I didn't notice
This weed i'm smoking
Makes me feel like waves are crashing down around me

These waves is crashing down
(These waves, These waves, These waves is crashing down) x2
