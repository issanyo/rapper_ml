[Chorus: Dizzy Wright]
Blazin' up the kill
I'm too turnt with no chill
Bro, this is all for the feel
I'm movin' slow with no wheels
These hoes embracin' my skills
You won't blaze it up, then I will
Man, this is for the feel
Man, this is how I feel

[Verse 1: Dizzy Wright]
I'm gettin' high in my high rise
And I still can't believe I'm him
In LA, a nigga got a pool on the roof
So I'm thinkin' I might go take a swim
Took a couple out the ATM
So I doubled up and then deposit back
When the dollar callin', I'ma holla back
I'm fuckin' with her off how she act
New releases, more events
Talk to Dame and the money spent
52 shows in 61 days
With a stoner kid, that's dummy lit
I feel like Nino Brown with a money clip
Rollin' big J's with the funky tip
Hangin' up niggas like ornaments
With performances
We made a career
Couple 100 thou' I made in a year
Niggas diss me when I ain't even here
So I'm flippin' the page
Comin' home to my dinner made
My story couldn't fit the page
Everyday is a different stage
So I'm switchin' lanes
With a pretty thang
With a bitch that ain't had dick in days
Gotta keep it real with no chill
We don't ever fuck and then post about it
Fuck her face until her throat retire
Got a pornstar, finna polarize her
I know my limits
But I blacked out way before the fire
Man, I'm fucked up in my hotel
If these hoes tell then they lyin'
'Cause man I'm

[Chorus: Dizzy Wright]
Blazin' up the kill
I'm too turnt with no chill
Bro, this is all for the feel
I'm movin' slow with no wheels
These hoes embracin' my skills
You won't blaze it up, then I will
Man, this is for the feel
Man, this is how I feel

[Verse 2: Demrick]
Book me a flight for two days
I need a thick chick to go both ways
And she got friends, tell 'em hop in
We in for wild nights and them good days
Rap shit always good pay
So I went and got it
Made the product and count the profit
Haters watchin' but can't stop us
We smoke the strongest, our hoes the thickest
Don't you wish you was rollin' with us?
Follow me down the road to riches
Hoes and bitches, joints and swishers
They know the difference
Gotta pay attention to the detail
Hustle daily for the retail
Still countin' money off weed sales
She got pig tails and the lingerie
She want her hair pulled out the long day
From the elevator to the hallway
Of the hotel like, "Oh well"
We won't tell, that's okay
'Cause that's all business
Work the pussy out, that's all fitness
Ounces with us
They bouncin' with us
Be out with us
Servin' outfittas
For the quick fit
One night stand for the quick fix
Two elbows and siz zips
Smoke good when we take trips
Niggas talk shit but we really hit
Just ask around
Take another hit and pass around
Niggas get mad, they don't have the sound
Way out of town
They out of bounds
I'm always down to smoke

[Chorus: Dizzy Wright]
Blazin' up the kill
I'm too turnt with no chill
Bro, this is all for the feel
I'm movin' slow with no wheels
These hoes embracin' my skills
You won't blaze it up, then I will
Man, this is for the feel
Man, this is how I feel

[Verse 3: Oktane]
I say new lord to this rap shit
We way past that swag shit
No shirt with the jacket
Made your next and ex backflip
Boy, give me space
Only real in the place
Pass it, puff to the face
Life is only what you make it
You hatin' 'cause I'm made it great (sauce)
Everythin' exclusive
Got 'em sendin' news, it's really raw
I'm out here signin' boujee
One smoke with the crew
Girl, get involved
You don't know me
You better not bro me
No time for Jo-Bronies
Weed and women, they came for the homies
Time to show me

[Verse 4 : Price]
No chill, no chill
A nigga need more weed and more pills
A bitch stressed, you don't know how bein' broke feel
Never got bail and what you do is probly more bills
How yo cash with the gas for your automobile
Free Matt, my brodie, he ain't takin' no deals
He said, "Drop somethin' the bad bitches gon' feel"
Kickin' flow all the borin' ass rappers gon' steal
Here he comes
Keys open doors, weed open pores
I'm hotter than a Juvenile 400 Degrez CD in a store
Fuck a wave, get a whole beat for the boy
Pay a fee for my voice
I live the shit these rappers say I do
Known for breakin' hearts and breakin' rules
My niggas fools advise, you to play it cool
You got punk round you, you got punk round you, nigga

[Chorus: Dizzy Wright]
Blazin' up the kill
I'm too turnt with no chill
Bro, this is all for the feel
I'm movin' slow with no wheels
These hoes embracin' my skills
You won't blaze it up, then I will
Man, this is for the feel
Man, this is how I feel
