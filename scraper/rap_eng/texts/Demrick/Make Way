[Intro]
I love that stuff, been drinking it for years

[Verse 1]
Make way for the new leaders
That mix Belvedere with the two liters
The roll through cheaters in them two seaters
Cooking up classic albums with a few features
I lay vocals on pro tools and v-necks and bow shoes I call LA local
My beatin' mama's like the side-aid tofu
We don't valet, we roll through, to see if it's necessarry
Might need a secretary, my presence is legendary
Niggas pickin' flees like a veterinary
I'm lookin' for a queen I could probably marry
I always had a thing for a Halley Berry
Want the ice and the cream like Ben & Jerry's
Livin' high like real check the commentary

[Hook]
The necessary day shit, yup
The necessary day shit
All my life, that's all I know
All my diamonds break to gold
Man, this rap shit saved my soul
That's why I never give it up

[Verse 2]
And I don't wanna sound ungrateful
Cause God gave me what I prayed for
But when yo flow stay all volcano
Hoes take ya down like drain-o, it's hard to say no
I got a passion for hard fashion
Chick in spandex pants with the fat asses
You know I love to roll up, puff, pass it
Put it up in the air like a pump action
And I'm tired of the pump faking
Pass off if you can't make it
I'm too hot to hold these two shots of more
I 2Pac my soul, I'm too off the road to steer clear from problems
Young and livin' lawless
Mad cause I get mine regardless

[Hook]
The necessary day shit, yup
The necessary day shit
All my life, that's all I know
I won't never save these hoes
Get fade in the play you close
That's why I never give it up

[Outro]
