Day dreaming our lives
I feel like I'm sleep walking
But I'm wide awake, wide awake
I'm wide awake, wide awake, wide awake

This is everything I said it'd be
Nothing like the way it seemed
Got me watching what I wish for
It might come true, it might true, true


[Verse 1] Demrick

I was just a kid with a dream
Started rappin' at age 13
Asked my mom for a mic, I wanna be like
What i'd seen on the TV screen
So no I wasn't playing ball
Or walking through the halls at a mall
Thinking back to my very first track
I grabbed a marker and wrote it on the wall
See, me and moms didn't get along
And my paps really wasn't involved
So at age 14 I packed up my things to leave
Yeah, that's problem solved
Thought the world revolved around me
I'ma make it off rap
Y'all Just wait and see
Then i'll be back, like look at me now
I'm know to be mad, but damn to be proud
And the crowd gon' be loud at the shows when I rock it
Radio gon' play me, and people going to jock it
Nobody can stop this, I'm way too focused
They tried to discourage me, but that was just hopeless
Biggie, Pac, Nas, were my coaches
50, Jay-Z and Eminem was my coaches
I listened and I soaked it all in
They say I fell asleep, well
I guess I'm still falling
I'm all in

I'm wide awake, wide awake, wide awake

It might come true, it might true, true


[Verse 2]

I woke up on a plane
High above the clouds and the rain
Been on tour for three months straight
Finally headed back home to LA
Now I have an album to write
One I've been waiting on for my whole life
So much to say in such very little time
Going over what I say in every single line
I remember when I quit my nine to five
I was 19 years old, walking off the job
From that day forth, I've been living how I want
And I'm not going to say that I never did wrong
But that right there is between me and god
And everything could be resolved
Begging for the day
And I pray that I see them all
Another chance for me to sing my songs
'Cause it never really been about more than that
We used to freestyle
How you can't afford to rap?!
Standing in a huddle like a quaterback
Around back, sippin' forties in my cul de sac
I promise that I won't let success change me
Hands on your head saying "No it can't be"
Same young kid that you knew had a dream
