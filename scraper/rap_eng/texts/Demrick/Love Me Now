[Demrick]
Oh yeah, they change up but we ain’t ever changed. For real

[Verse 1]
I stay connect like wifi
Small circle friends that I got
Same ones ‘round with me, they’ve been down with me
They’ll be there when we on top. (Watch!)
There won’t be a show that I don’t rock
Always keep it real, we don’t go pot. (Never!)
But still got sold out shows lined up ‘round the block
Hustle, don’t stop
Haters, they ‘gon plot. (Plot.)
They see what you got, they ‘gon want it too
Stay in tune
Streets is rude like [?] bully still in [?]
On the move
So much to do and little time to prove. (Prove.)
Myself than anybody never put a dollar in the pocket of the crew, oo
Niggas watching, they ‘gon lose. (Lose)
Procrastinating, hit the snooze
I graduated from the street life, but barely made it through the schools
Love to watch niggas double-back like “Demrick, can I get a verse” when you treated me the worst
Said this shit would never work
Now you get curbed
For the thirst

[Hook]
Didn’t love me then, bitch don’t love me now
Make these hits but shit, we still ‘gon rep the underground
Every time I come around, shut it down
Didn’t love me then, bitch don’t love me now

Didn’t love me then, bitch don’t love me now
Talking shit but on the low I know you love this sound
Every time I come around, shut it down
Didn’t love me then, bitch don’t love me now

[Verse 2]
Don’t let your Vijay’s ‘cause your mind changed, vibrate from a high place
My mind-state is why I hate on others, get your bread at my grade
All these nights I stayed in
Writing my way out my situation just to give it all to loyal fees, royalties, [?] and affiliations. (Hell nah!)
I had to do some reevaluating
You wasn’t here for my struggles, you ain’t here for the vacation. (Nah!)
Finally got me a new chick
My DM fills up with new pics
People saying “Demrick, you swish.”
New number like “Who dis?”
To the same one, still A-one with my day ones
I know where I came from
You just want me to play dumb
And you did front on me when I came up
But it’s all good, we here now
I look around, only real around. (Only real around.)
The fake that got filtered out
You in the drought
Bounce, bounce!

[Hook]
Didn’t love me then, bitch don’t love me now
Make these hits but shit, we still ‘gon rep the underground
Every time I come around, shut it down
Didn’t love me then, bitch don’t love me now

Didn’t love me then, bitch don’t love me now
Talking shit but on the low I know you love this sound
Every time I come around, shut it down
Didn’t love me then, bitch don’t love me now
