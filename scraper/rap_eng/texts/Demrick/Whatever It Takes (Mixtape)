[Chorus: Charlie Scene]
I do whatever it takes to make it
Break through anything I'm face to face with
It's true, you gon' make me lose my patience
'Cause victory is mine and I'mma take it
So put your hands up

[Verse 1: Prodigal Sunn]
I'm in this like the red blood of a winner, heart of a champion
Moving through the game, relevant, strong as an elephant
Face anything that I'm faced, I'm wise and intelligent
Skills across the field, on the court, king of my regiment
Train every day, being lazy don't pay
If you do what it takes, you could rise on your way
So you did it from the sons of man, Wu-Tang Clan
Rose from the bottom of the pot to top of the pan
And if you believe in yourself, then you know that you can
Do anything you put your heart and mind to, rowing them in
Flow and expand, flow with the team, keep it serene
And you win some, you lose some, all part of the dream
I'll never give up, focused on the goal at hand
Take my time, do it right, orchestrate with my plan
Activate, captivate the fans, the name on the brand
Divided we fall, united we stand

[Chorus: Charlie Scene]
I do whatever it takes to make it
Break through anything I'm face to face with
It's true, you gon' make me lose my patience
'Cause victory is mine and I'mma take it
So put your hands up

[Verse 2: Demrick]
Too many lames in my lane, I don't entertain
Eliminate anything that's in the way
We in a game full of clones and clowns, can't even hold your ground
Boy, you'll never hold the crown, bitch niggas need ultrasounds
Cookies by the pound, freshly baked, forever beg the chase
Moving through the interstate to get the cake
Gotta get a plaque for all my niggas that got a case
You out a captive safe and those who definitely get a cape
I'm feeling out of place in this room full of fake
Taking food off my plate, worst move you could make
Flatline, stainless steel, black nine
Baow-baow, lay 'em flat, send 'em back to the other side, bye
Win or lose, just know I die for my troops
How you keep it a hundred with those lies in your truth
You see I been A1 since day one, just say something different
You don't live it, there's a difference, take your bitches by the minute

[Chorus: Charlie Scene]
I do whatever it takes to make it
Break through anything I'm face to face with
It's true, you gon' make me lose my patience
'Cause victory is mine and I'mma take it
So put your hands up

[Verse 3: Fudd Rukus]
Welcome to the machine
The nightmare's not far behind but the dream's near
It's never ending till I'm trending like Supreme gear
There's nothing clean here, replacing all the soapy shit
Don't pay him for the dope he spits, I'm making it with opiates
Shooting for the moon like I'm racing with the Soviets
Bring the West back, it's feeling vacant now that Kobe quit
I'm rolling in your chick's Accord or my '64
Sipping Coors in a Lincoln Ford, bumping Liquid Swords
Even if I don't agree what the culture shifted towards
I'll die without the music kind of like what Jim with The Doors
They wanna pull me in the gutter like Pennywise
But I'm wise with the pennies, plenty tried, instead I steady rise
I haven't left the streets, barely slept in weeks
All my equity is dirty and the septic clean
Kept it G and bypassed the meter, now my grass is greener
Over white trash and cheaper, motherfucker, thought you knew, huh?

[Chorus: Charlie Scene]
I do whatever it takes to make it
Break through anything I'm face to face with
It's true, you gon' make me lose my patience
'Cause victory is mine, and I'mma take it
So put your hands up
