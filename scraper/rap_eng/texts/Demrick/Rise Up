Since  the Watts riot of 1965 has the city seemed so out of control. Los Angeles is still on the edge

[B-Real]
Living in the big city
The American dream
Is far roaming in the streets of greed
Everywhere I turn I'm on a mission for more
But I ain't selling my soul
With the dope theres no girl
I'm on a one way box to the top
Hitting the strip but got a sound that would rally the block
I'm in the fast lane and I won't stop
You ain't nothing but talk
You couldn't hang on the rope by ball

[Sen Dog]
This life that I live
It ain't for the weak
Got my roddy gangster that came off the street
I'm trying to keep the peace
But I gotta keep my pace
Got these drunk police
Want me all rappy
And I'm searching for the higher ground
I want my head in the sky
So high that I can't come down
Leave your lies in every town across the nation
Cause you can never stop to play

[Hook]
Gotta Rise up (to the top, to the top)
Can't stop (How high can you get?)
Gotta Rise up (to the top, to the top)
Can't stop (How high can you get?)
Cause what goes up must come down
So we gotta rise up to the Higher ground
Rise Up (Rise Up)
Rise Up (Rise Up)
Rise Up (Rise Up)
How high can you get?

[B-Real]
Cruising in the drop chevy
Got my foot on the floor
I'm hitting switches and my brim is heavy
You wanna look inside
And see whos crossing the brine
Curiosity is killing you
With stick in the prime
I get high from the brim in the set
Never gripping the square
But all you haters couldn't hold my
Don't need a clip for my ? straight
You should leave it alone
And check your toe cause my line will spit

[Sen Dog]
This right heres as high as it gets
Somebody likes it..the hell
Cause you stepped on the sex
But guess who will show you, you gotta pass the check
Got my clock on deck and my custom vest streets
You came, for me I'm the best
And you can keep the dress
Cause I'm smoke at the less
Turn a step back I'm tired of getting pushed

[Hook]
Gotta rise up to the top (to the top)
Can't stop (How high can you get?)
Gotta rise up to the top (to the top)
Can't stop (How high can you get?)
Cause what goes up must come down
So we gotta rise up to the Higher ground
Rise Up (Rise Up)
Rise Up (Rise Up)
Rise Up (Rise Up)
How high can you get?

[Sen Dog]
I go psycho, crazy Michael Myers
Except the stages on fire going higher
Cause when I lean on a flyer
Theres so much more to make the whole city rise
This defines a man to get the whole world lifted
Wall man trying to make a land with a mission
There's no way you can stand in this position
You can't take the heat get the fuck about the tension

[B-Real]
Go with the will to hustle, you see if we hit the floor
You'll never stop it you ain't got the muscle
Were going to world top, homeboy this is the show
We gotta blow up the stage be out the door
Sometimes we all nedd an escape
So when we form our track
Well get your mind while we get the stat
I made a pack with a crew on the hill
We continue to build with all the people who believe their bill

[Hook]
Gotta Rise up (to the top, to the top)
Can't stop (How high can you get?)
Gotta Rise up (to the top, to the top)
Can't stop (How high can you get?)
Cause what goes up must come down
So we gotta rise up to the Higher ground
Rise Up (Rise Up)
Rise Up (Rise Up)
Rise Up (Rise Up)
How high can you get?
