Lord knows I can’t sleep, my mind racing like the Indi 500
Gotta find a way to turn the… into something
Won’t take a loss, gotta make it pay off
Cause these haters wanna take away the play, I ain’t on
Too hungry to not eat, so who gonna stop me?
Nigga’s been dropping off when the pros get rocking
The shots start popping off when these blocks I’m walkin
Nightmares if a casket that’s not my coffin!

And it’s not that often that I ever say
I’m really feeling it’s my brain on drugs
But I’m not a dealer, always serving up murder
But I’m not a killer and my mother fucker I’m saying
I ain’t got no feelings!
So you got the feelings and these hoes already know
I ain’t got no feelings hard core is the North Pole dead of winter
Just know anywhere I go I was born a winner, yeah!

Hook:
I think I might smoke today
Smoke until I fade away
Go and get a little liquor
Kick it with my niggas
Hear what they got to say!
I think I might smoke today
Smoke until I fade away
Go and get a little liquor
Kick it with my niggas
Hear what they got to say!
This life we live is crazy, crazy, crazy
Sometimes I just smoke to get away
This life we live is crazy, crazy, crazy
Sometimes I just smoke to fade away

Fade away like MJ, drop a baseline
With 1. 5 on a clock left!
Always got it on deck, niggas going to be upset
Go against, get left, on the cement!
Gotta holler at my homies, find out what the next move is
My uncle just got locked for the next few years
Momma always taught me to respect my pears
If that check don’t clear, it's your neck right here
And this kush got my head on the next frontier
Out of space feeling out of place
Ain’t nobody safe when them reals ain’t pay shit
Real kids get killed every day
So I can’t let it go to waste, it’s gotta make the shit pop
Can’t stop, till I get everything I want
I’ve just seen a lot get caught up in hot
Water when that heat about to cook that beef like…
Got a problem? We’re on ‘em!

This life we live is crazy, crazy, crazy
Sometimes I just smoke to get away
This life we live is crazy, crazy, crazy
Sometimes I just smoke to fade away

I think I need to relapse
Sober up, relapse, pour a little something after we sack
Go and kick with my homies
My niggas that know me
Bring a couple bitches and a fifth of Jack
Cause ain’t no ghetto ways where I stay
It's day to day, there ain't no vacay where I'm living at
So I need a spot that I can go and I can kick…
So I need a spot that I can go and I can kick…
I need a spot that I can go and I can kick…
