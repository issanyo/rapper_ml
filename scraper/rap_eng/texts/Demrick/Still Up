[Hook]
I’m still up
Let me roll some kill up
Every glass I fill up
This feels so familiar
I’ve been up for nights, me and my familiar
Ain’t none realer, want the house with the villa

I’m still up
Let me roll some kill up
Every glass I fill up
This feels so familiar
I’ve been up for nights, me and my familiar
Ain’t none realer, want the house with the villa

I’m still up

[Verse 1]
That Cali Rachis feels like body blows
Where that shot-ie goes. It’s adios. Vámonos
(I’m still up)
Nobody knows how tomorrow goes
Not alone when I walk this road
At least I’ll never say that I sold my soul
(I’m still up)
Added every day, hustle overload
I think I’m ‘bout to overdose
I still take a platinum chain over gold
(I’m still up)
The throne’s for the taker so I overthrow
And I put this on all I know
It’s always gonna be fam over host
(I’m still up)
Even though so many try to count me out
Ain’t got a dollar in their bank account
Well I’m up early on that pay for route
(I’m still up)
L.A. be the city that I made my town
And you know that I hold that down
Came up in the name but they ain’t allowed
(I’m still up)
Rolled through the back with a [?]
Yeah you know we ‘bout to burn that down
Keep passing, we don’t turn that down
(I’m still up)
Shine through the crowd to the top on bound
Westside, that’s where I’m found
But all around the world they know this sound

[Hook]
I’m still up
Let me roll some kill up
Every glass I fill up
This feels so familiar
I’ve been up for nights, me and my familiar
Ain’t none realer, want the house with the villa

I’m still up
Let me roll some kill up
Every glass I fill up
This feels so familiar
I’ve been up for nights, me and my familiar
Ain’t none realer, want the house with the villa

I’m still up

[Verse 2]
Prepare for the worst, but I’m ready for the best
Put me in the dirt, be the day I rest
Never done dirt then no contest
(I’m still up)
All these other rappers is no contest
If it don’t make money then it’s not progress
All the petty beef I do not process
(I’m still up)
Obsessed with success, that’s heat I guess
Probably ‘cause the Hennessey and family stress
Nothing ever handed out a man of respect
(I’m still up)
I gotta be the west number one prospect
Haven’t made a fan of you yet
Ask around the game, I’m a definite threat
(I’m still up)
‘Cause I hear sleepers are cussing are deaf
And they got another brother they regret
And I don’t really want to meet none of them yet
(I’m still up)
Every night I’m in that studio cheefing
Don’t let looks be deceiving
Nigga, we eating
It’s my season
(I’m still up)
Drinking whiskey out of these shot glasses
Smoking weed out of bongs, no papers
And we all hold our own, no favours
(I’m still up)
Tonight just might be my last one
This life I lead is a fast one
What’s it all worth without passion?

[Hook]
I’m still up
Let me roll some kill up
Every glass I fill up
This feels so familiar
I’ve been up for nights, me and my familiar
Ain’t none realer, want the house with the villa

I’m still up
I’m still up
