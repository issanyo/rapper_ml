[Chorus]
They say patience is a virtue (is a virtue)
When you're headed for them gold and silver circles (ow)
When you're headed for them gold and silver circles (on the road)
Independent, you ain't gotta go commercial (yeah I know), no
They say patience is a virtue (is a virtue)
When you're headed for them gold and silver circles (ow)
When you're headed for them gold and silver circles (on the road)
Independent, you ain't gotta go commercial (yeah I know), no

[Verse 1: Dizzy Wright]
Yo, who do I think I am? (am)
If great minds think alike, then, buddy, let's link again (again)
So I hit up the D-e-m (yeah)
That Blaze with Us was cool, but we gotta touch the people, fam (fam)
Don't mean to alert you, nah (nah)
But I need them gold and silver circles on my empty walls (yeah)
I'm talkin' a milli' sold (sold)
Off of them things I felt (right), but not with no silly flows (no)
Motivated all the time, I brainwash myself
Can't brainwash these kids, a strong circle creates a powerful circle
So, I told 'em create and win (let's win)
Be patient and open up your lens, move it in ten
I got the recipe (true)
You gotta be willin' to take it wherever, whatever it takes, I'm a better me (whoo)
They only respect the dollar, but, nigga, never me (what?)
You know what? Never mind it
You too blindsided
The shit you enjoy ain't impressin' me
You got to mothafuckin' set goals, you got to let it be
You got independent etiquette, but you trouble minded
You lookin' devilish, you gotta live heavenly, yes, sir

[Chorus]
They say patience is a virtue (is a virtue)
When you're headed for them gold and silver circles (ow)
When you're headed for them gold and silver circles (on the road)
Independent, you ain't gotta go commercial (yeah I know), no
They say patience is a virtue (is a virtue)
When you're headed for them gold and silver circles (ow)
When you're headed for them gold and silver circles (on the road)
Independent, you ain't gotta go commercial (yeah I know), no

[Verse 2]
You see, I've never been the type to take the easy route (nah)
So independent, we recorded this up in Reezy house (huh!?)
Some find the bad seeds and weed 'em out
Me, I plant seeds to grow into money trees with plenty leaves around (yes)
Fans of the foundation for growth, so I go and meet the crowd (sup!)
You know it's me at the shows, because you see the clouds
Just know the road gon' get bumpy, but then it evens out
So keep your people with you, the ones that's believing now (real)
And still movin', got that sound, don't disrespect the group (never)
'Cause it all comes back around and through, just like the letter Q
I need a pretty girl with a booty and an attitude (ay)
That loves to roll the blunts and fuck all through the afternoons
Everything comes in time, just keep a open mind
This is hard work and faith, when it's all combined
You need to focus on your own before you go at mine
And please keep your eyes open wide, don't ignore the signs

[Chorus]
They say patience is a virtue (is a virtue)
When you're headed for them gold and silver circles (ow)
When you're headed for them gold and silver circles (on the road)
Independent, you ain't gotta go commercial (yeah I know), no
They say patience is a virtue (is a virtue)
When you're headed for them gold and silver circles (ow)
When you're headed for them gold and silver circles (on the road)
Independent, you ain't gotta go commercial (yeah I know), no

[Verse 3: Demrick]
Blessed by all the older cats, so respect, y'all owe me that
Even if I had all lefts, I never let y'all hold me back
Industry fakin', I'm over that, labels want to control the raps
You talkin' like I don't know the trap, I used to scrap in them cul-de-sacs, my nigga
Please, thinkin' of all of them racks a nigga did stack up in lawyer fees (ay)
Thinkin' back to mama workin' two jobs, she couldn't spoil me (nah)
But patience was the thing that lit it up
You gon' catch me give my life before you catch me givin' up, yup
Never give up, nah, never give in
Only playin' to win, ain't gon' say it again
Usin' patience, never waitin', procrastination
There's never been a place that I've been complacent in
So, I'm rollin' up, showin' up, last one leavin'
Said I need it like the oxygen I'm breathin' and I mean it
40 degrees in November, mic is on summer season
My opponents never have a reason to say they can beat me, I'm gone

[Chorus]
They say patience is a virtue (is a virtue)
When you're headed for them gold and silver circles (ow)
When you're headed for them gold and silver circles (on the road)
Independent, you ain't gotta go commercial, no (yeah I know)
They say patience is a virtue (is a virtue)
When you're headed for them gold and silver circles (ow)
When you're headed for them gold and silver circles (on the road)
Independent, you ain't gotta go commercial, no (yeah I know)
