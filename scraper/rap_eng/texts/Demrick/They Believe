[Intro: Euroz]
Yeah
It's when the Henny hits you

[Verse 1: Euroz]
Alive and plotting on my future
Rarely thinking about the past
I don't stress the minor shit
I'm knowing it'll pass
It be the ones with a whole lot to say
That don't know the half
If it ain't Miles or Coltrane
I ain't trying to hear that jazz
If shit ain't adding up
Subtract 'em, it's simple math
A little space to write what matter
Take off and hit the mask
If stores was convenient
All them lick we hit were mass
Loose spent faster than it came
But that time you get outlast
It ain't no joke
Just to stop from breaking down you got to laugh
Its where I learned to rap
Would treat my cell like the lab
Recollecting so they grow
Show and telling not to brag
Karma cost me later on
For now put it on my tab
Headed to the bank like this shit is off the glass
The crown you hear I'm speaking on been looking up for grabs
Y'all question if they'll be great
My question's will they fucking last
Ducking all these fads
Still ain't done no fucking dabs

[Hook: Euroz]
I be at this shit gratefully
I can't let the spirit stray form me
Feeling like Kaepernick
There be days I wanna take a knee
I ain't called my grandma in a minute
But I know she still pray for me
As long as you know yourself
It don't matter what they believe
It don't matter what they believe

[Bridge: Demrick]
I can't, I can't even front
I been living like of wild lately
Always breaking bread
While niggas been down to wild with me
Miss the days my baby always had a smile for me
But keep the faith I know that daddy got a towel for me

[Verse 2: Demrick]
The sun shining I'm back in Vegas
Boy its been a minute
Forty shows in a row
Gave my soul to those in attendance
Set goals, established my independence
As the stories told of my flows
Others benefited
That was then, this is now
I'm still moving through the crowd
Ghost smile, bling blow
Fake shit I tuned out
I'm tapped into the real
I can't help how I feel
Block out the rest no contest
I manifest my destiny
Niggas less than me testing me
They can't get to me
Misery loves company
So fit into it comfortably
But far as me and mine
We stay focused on the grind
I know the best things come in time
Just don't cross the line

[Hook: Euroz]
I be at this shit gratefully
I can't let the spirit stray form me
Feeling like Kaepernick
There be days I wanna take a knee
I ain't called my grandma in a minute
But I know she still pray for me
As long as you know yourself
It don't matter what they believe
It don't matter what they believe

[Verse 3: Dizzy Wright]
Yo
All my problems getting smoked off
I'm way too wavy
Y'all should probably call the coast guards
On my boat yard
I'm sending messages like postcards
The devil plotting on us but we know God
Just listen to me
Swerved off with some Henney and my moccasins
Teamwork make the dream work
And I'm feeling like coach Popovich
Its 2017, we still moving, still locking in
Still moving around with Floyd "Money" Mayweather confidence
Beating the odds
The records say that I'm undefeated
Legendary status yo I can give you a hundred reasons
With fundamentals I'm killing shit like its hunting season
I need to let my mind clear and search the getaways
Like Michael Schofield I need a prison break
Still with the funk but yo we had to go out different ways
No love lost I'm on my grind faithfully
I never thought that being positive would bring so much hate to me

[Hook: Euroz]
I be at this shit gratefully
I can't let the spirit stray form me
Feeling like Kaepernick
There be days I wanna take a knee
I ain't called my grandma in a minute
But I know she still pray for me
As long as you know yourself
It don't matter what they believe
It don't matter what they believe

[Outro: Euroz]
No
It don't matter
It don't matter, it don't matter
No
It don't matter
It don't matter, it don't matter
No
No
I need y'all to pray for me
I need somebody to pray for me
