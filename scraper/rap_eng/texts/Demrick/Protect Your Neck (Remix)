[Intro]
Brought the remix
Yeeaah
Yea-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah

[Verse 1: Big Lenbo]
Brought the remix
Still screamin' who next
Who flex- fat nasty motha-fucka
Snapping like a 2-step
Ruthless, with the words
No lines blurred
See em coming 20/20
Pack a 40 for the cure
RattPack progenitor
Swinging swords
At competitor- predator
Keep 'em on they toes like pedicure
Fuck the overlords
It's the rebel ripping
Never slippin'
Now I'm on people love to hate
Embracing contradiction
Whole team
Move past your gleam
Your third eye blurred
My hand's unseen
Digging in the dirt
Putting in the work
No days off boy you look soft
Bivins with the four ball
Boy you look off
Been a refer addict
Ad lib a smoker's cough
(cough cough)
It's the Asiatic causing mad havoc
Shook ones can't stand it
Fuck around I make your storyline tragic

[Bridge: Big Lenbo and Demrick]
Brought the Remix!
Fuck around I make your storyline tragic
Screamin' who's next
Brought the Remix
Fuck around and I make your storyline tragic
No days off

[Verse 2: Demrick]
Me and Big Lenbo
Breaking down the fundamentals
Nothin' coincidental
This world is a civil
Keep your head on swivel and your eyes open
I ain't smokin' boy I'm mind copin'
Giving you nothin' but divine motive
Well its mirage-in in the minds of our fear
Got my third eye wide
Now division is clear
Tears shed for my peers dead
Pour beers for the years spent
When I'm gone I wonder what a real went (Where they at?)
So enjoy it while it last
Revin' on the gas
Livin fast
Remember ten stories
Find a different past
We in a paradox
That show if you aware or not
Look around boy is you here or not (Is you here or not?)
Why we want that pendiment
That road that's why
They keep us dreamin' while we on the fly
It got us caught
I rap my way up out of that nightmare
To some brighter days
But can't even shine around my way
Without catchin' shade (We still movin')
But that's okay

[Bridge: Big Lenbo]
Brought the Remix!
Screamin' who's next!
Brought the Remix!

[Verse 3: Jay Lonzo]
Keep it runnin'
'Fore the ego's collide
Got the flags flyin' high
And the eagle inside
I'm with the whole 'nother class
You harassin' your people
I'm on my way to the Regal
You sad for leavin' you see through
I'm lethal
Young gunner, young runner
For the track
One hunnid'
I run it up
This for Lenny
From the Pack
Loud bro but the crowd showin' my sound
You clown's jumpin' around
I found somethin' hereditary
You don't want to flip the challenge
To the Legendary
You don't wanna call me out
That's that cemetery
I be runnin' scenarios
In my head
Like Mario
Man I cap M's all on yo head
It's the Brooklyn-born zookeeper
I'm the new leader
Flex, save up the bombs
This shit's a new bleeder
I'm Gil Peter
The ease in the zone
Zookeeper cause all my rhymes are beats on their own
I'm seekin' the throne
I'm leakin' my poems
A weave in the stone
Is your pen eight like this
You should leave it alone
Got four or five left, but the rest is set
Y'all ain't ready for this drop
So protect your neck!

[Hook: Big Lenbo]
Brought the Remix!
Screamin' who's next!
Brought the Remix!

[Verse 4: Blaque Keyz]
I'm like a Ginsu knife when the pencil writes
But hold on, it's been so long that i've been so nice
And these days I'm wakin' up with a temper to fight
And crack heads like Kimbo Slice when the tempo is right
On any instrumental I strike with a [?] twice
Your penalty's death
My enemies be givin' me life
You finna' be next
You finicky, you run out of breath
I'm finna' be Mike
[?] one right, I'm spinnin' your neck
I sin as the night
A villan with a pillager's plight
Get on the mic and I kill it if the feelin' is right
So give me respect
It'd too long that I've been polite
You got a gripe then call Lenbo
My kinfolk's nice

[Hook: Big Lenbo]
Brought the Remix!
Screamin' who's next!
Brought the Remix!

[Verse 5: Just Juice]
Livin' to whack a [?] pack
And my motor been stayin' blessed up
[?][?] in the pressure but never deal with the [?]
Got my eight ball leather rep the culture forever
Fuck the [?] cross competitors medals up on his dresser
Git my mind right
Enemy pillars up in my hindsight
[?]tight, see all these p-offs so fuck your [?]
I'm like better and nevertheless I better win
[?] my influence half of the track they get it in
With real sworn [?]
In em' and willin' to kill again
This rap up in my filaments bumpin' to your [?]
It's Juice and B-I-G L-E-N-B-O cop [?]
[?] no we [?] an dpull in on these millennials
No fakin' lather in bacon the way I'm takin'
[?][?][?] and my cranium keep me wakin'
Though my trigger finger rakin' this [?] is [?] dead-ily
Remember through this music
Immortalize through the centuries
Juice

[Hook: Big Lenbo]

Still screamin' who's next!

{Outro: Big Lenbo]
No days!
No days off!
