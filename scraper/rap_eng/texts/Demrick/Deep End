Real shit, real shit..

[Verse 1] Demrick
Everything changes, going through these phases
Used to spend my nights sleeping on the couch, now my house is so spacious
Still need to decorate it and a woman's touch to make it
Really feel like home but I'm always gone, no time to entertain it
Strip clubs for entertainment
Bottle service entertainment
Couple trips a month out to Vegas, now my habits getting dangerous
Texted my ex, she told me, "save it"
Her heart ain't to play with
Man, I used to be her favorite
Now she treat me like a stranger

[Hook] Demrick
I need to realize my chi
I've been going OD
Turning up every weekend
Need to slow it down
I've been speeding all around
Living too fast, I might go off the deep end

I need to realize my chi
I've been going OD
Turning up every weekend
Need to slow it down
I've been speeding all around
Living too fast, I might go off the deep end

[Refrain] Demrick
Broken man, I'm in pieces
Don't want no one else to see this
Messing up all the pain
Weed, Whiskey and Cocaine
Weed, Whiskey and Cocaine
Fucking 'round with my brain
Maybe we all insane
Maybe we all this way..

[Verse 2] Mike Lee
Me and my crew, we don't play around
They look at my past and compare it now
They put me in class and I rap at clowns
If you're looking for beef then you got it now
Really from the soil, really in the boy
The realest in the story
Keep the liquor pouring
I don't want a piece. I want the whole thing
Instincts took over. Comatose roller-coaster
Waking up with some folders, no, we all need some closure
Saying shit in the moment
Wait a second, we ain't homies
Ain't twisting up that Stoney Point? Is you a phony?
Never catch me by my lonely
Ain't shit you could tell me
Oh hell naw

[Verse 3] Demrick
Self-doubt creeping in again
What the fuck is going on?
Why's something always wrong?
Feeling like I'm holding on
I just want to be great, shit, I just want to be grateful
I don't want to fuck around with these hoes, I just want to be faithful
I just want to be stable. I just want to be able
To help Mom's when the rent is due plus the internet and the cable
I just got to stay focused. I just need to stay on track
Took a while to finally realize this time I waste don't come back

[Hook] Demrick
I need to realize my chi
I've been going OD
Turning up every weekend
Need to slow it down
I've been speeding all around
Living too fast, I might go off the deep end

I need to realize my chi
I've been going OD
Turning up every weekend
Need to slow it down
I've been speeding all around
Living too fast, I might go off the deep end

[Refrain] Demrick
Broken man, I'm in pieces
Don't want no one else to see this
Messing up all the pain
Weed, Whiskey and Cocaine
Weed, Whiskey and Cocaine
Fucking 'round with my brain
Maybe we all insane
Maybe we all this way..
