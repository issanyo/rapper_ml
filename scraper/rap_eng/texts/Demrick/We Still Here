[Verse 1: Demrick]
Man on a mission, ill disposition
That's the way a nigga living
Hooks like I spent my days out fishing
Never underestimate the vision, listen
Roll through the city like I won't lose
Lost so much I done lost so many
Hard to get around when your heart's so heavy
So I choose to sing blues from a brand new Chevy
Stack it to the ceiling and I won't look back
Put it on the line for my fam, that's a fact
Call up my partners and they got my back
Flow so tight that it's never off track
I tried to overcome all my obstacles
In my shows they pop off like Rock N Roll
There's so much in life you cannot control
So I just close my eyes and let go

[Hook: Demrick]
Tell me what more that you want?
I done gave it everything I got
Pour a little more henny over these rocks, let's take a shot
To the fact that we still here
Lost so many along the way
I can pour out liquor all day long
That's why I write these songs
Tell me what more that you want?
I done gave it everything I got
Pour a little more henny over these rocks, let's take a shot
To the fact that we still here
Lost so many along the way
I can pour out liquor all day long
That's why I write these songs
Just for you

[Verse 2: Demrick]
And you too if you could relate
Hundred miles speedin' down the freeway
Yeah, I live life without an E break
Fell in love with freestyling over beattapes
Bitches in spandex and Jordan's, XXLs and Sources
Provided the way for me, so thank G-O-D that I never divorced it
Mama stressing bite down on the cuticles
In a car heading down to a funeral
Ugly thing on a day so beautiful
It's a shame cause it's business as usual
Got me numb to the world tryna find a way out no bank account
You can hit me on the pay-pal
I wanna say that I'm okay now
I put my bank down since I came out and you now it

[Hook: Demrick]
Tell me what more that you want?
I done gave it everything I got
Pour a little more henny over these rocks, let's take a shot
To the fact that we still here
Lost so many along the way
I can pour out liquor all day long
That's why I write these songs
Tell me what more that you want?
I done gave it everything I got
Pour a little more henny over these rocks, let's take a shot
To the fact that we still here
Lost so many along the way
I can pour out liquor all day long
That's why I write these songs
Just for you

[Verse 3: Dizzy Wright]
Mama say, look how big you are
Wish your grandfather could have seen you get this far
He’d be proud
Pour some liquor out for all my dogs
On my 2 feet tryna deal with this fame and loss
Well I'm taking shit a day at a time
Critical thinking, being happy, we’re just staying alive
You ain't real, you be playin' the sides
You would sell your soul for money and attention
With a day on the job, come on
But in fact, in fact, we still here
Tour the world just to come back home and switch gears
The devil is alive but that nigga don't live here
It ain't hard to keep it real so chill
If you ain't ready, why you tryna play in the field?
We worked to get here with confidence
Y'all can't say it for real
Funk Volume getting bragging rights
Demrick keep the weed we gon' dab tonight
Telling my fans I ain't ask for life
But I'm here for the world, nigga, pass the mic
Don't lack advice
Drownin' drama with a Hennessy shot
What more you want? I gave it all that I got

[Hook: Demrick]
Tell me what more that you want?
I done gave it everything I got
Pour a little more henny over these rocks, let's take a shot
To the fact that we still here
Lost so many along the way
I can pour out liquor all day long
That's why I write these songs
Tell me what more that you want?
I done gave it everything I got
Pour a little more henny over these rocks, let's take a shot
To the fact that we still here
Lost so many along the way
I can pour out liquor all day long
That's why I write these songs
Just for you
