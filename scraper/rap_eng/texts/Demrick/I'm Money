[Verse 1: Demrick]

I'm money ... oooh,oooh
I'm money ... oooh,oooh

(background repeating)

Hit'em like a million bucks
Feelin' like a billion bucks
Lookin' like a trillion bucks

[Hook]

I'm money ... Hey..ey
I'm money ... Hey..ey

[Verse 2: Demrick]

Dollars zeros price towns
Credit cards player down
Charge it,Charge it-max it out
Never ending bank account
I'm good , you good? we good!
Getting this money just like we should
And they wish they could
Lets get it understood
I'm Flya,Flya move it like roll a tyre
Get'em like a open fire
No survivours,no surrender,won't retire
Get it, spend it, lose it, grade it, credit, debit, in-vent it
Women with no spinin' lemons come and get it . I'm money!!

[Hook]

I'm money ... Hey..ey
I'm money ... Hey..ey

Hit'em like a million bucks
Feelin' like a billion bucks
Lookin' like a trillion bucks

[Verse 3: Demrick]

Ones,Fives,Tens,Twenties,Fiftys,Hundreds keep'em comin'
Thousands,Millions,Billions,Trillions enough to fill the entire building
Buyin' Dealin' Robbin' Stealin'
Never kick back just relaxin' chillin'
Sh*t made it out the hood
Ended it good,hard to describe that feelin'
Money,money,money gotta make that money
Don't ever let'em come try take that money
Make so much money that to hate that money
Yeah I've laughed at the bank but it ain't that funny
And i ain't that dumb cuz i ain't that broke
Body this beat when i spit this flow
Ain't tic-tac-toe, get that dope
Anywhere i go just Know,know,know
