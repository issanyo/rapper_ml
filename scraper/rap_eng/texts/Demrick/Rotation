[Verse 1] Demrick
You say I'm the one. (Oh yeah.)
You say that you ready. (You ready.)
Lets stay having fun, not make it so heavy
I'm feeling the buzz. Backwood full of headies
Whipped by my touch, open up like eleven
Chevy rollin' down the block. Hold up, let me park and stop
Smash in the parking lot, we don't care who we would watch
The way you ride on top, that shit is wavy to me
Day that baby making music
Lets fuck to my new album and get crazy to it
We're talking one night your man was lazy to you
Look at the way you do you. (Damn.)
'cause you gon' get it next time
Hit me on the FaceTime, you gon' get that face time
Yeah

[Chrous] Austin Sexton
She send emoji of a wave, now she sending me a plane
Baby, with my location
She feeling Demrick by the dabs, fuck around and fuck back
Put that ass in rotation

She do, (she do). And we do now
When she put that ass in rotation

She do, (she do). And we do now
When she put that ass in rotation

[Verse 2] Demrick
Pull up to my crib
Hop out the limo
Straight to my bed
Let's go for a trip
Tell me everything you miss when I get all off the list
All of your [?], we barely even kissed
Yeah we on that freaky shit
Tell me that you need this shit
Show me how deep it get, I'll put that ass to sleep again
Someone creepin' through the blinds, we on overdrive
Looks like she ain't never seen my sober side
This is you and I, nobody know about it
Just send a wave and a time, we won't go without it
Yeah, I'm a put you in rotation
All day long like them radio stations

[Chrous] Austin Sexton
She send emoji of a wave, now she sending me a plane
Baby, with my location
She feeling Demrick by the dabs, fuck around and fuck back
Put that ass in rotation

She do, (she do). And we do now
When she put that ass in rotation

She do, (she do). And we do now
When she put that ass in rotation

I do things, do things that you can't do
I move ways, move ways that they can't do
Get the dough, swagger, smoke an L, boy I can't lose
Living on the high like I'm sleeping on the plane

I do things, do things that you can't do
I move ways, move ways that they can't do
Get the dough, swagger, smoke an L, boy I can't lose
Living on the high like I'm sleeping on the plane
