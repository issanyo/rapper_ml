[Verse 1: Game]
Maybe it's time I change religions on you
Turn a Christian to a Muslim, turn a Buddhist to a Christian
Tell 'em Catholic Ronnie been it
Sippin' red wine inside the Pentagon
Writin sinister lines 'til all the ink inside my pen is gone
Jeremy Lin got the world watchin' ESPN
My sick porno obsession's got me watchin' these lesbians
I'm a sick fuckin' psychotic bastard
The mic is my sword, the booth is your casket
I'm sittin' inside a classic six-four with the ratchet
Throwin' up west side is my worst fuckin' habit
All these snap backs and egos
Eyes lookin' through peep holes is why I don't trust no one except God and Tim Tebow
I'm livin' my destiny, poppin' pills, high as fuck
Fuckin' bitches in the club, holdin' my Spades bottle up
I think it's time you salute me or shoot me
Either way, I'm the star of this motherfuckin' movie

[Verse 2: Slim The Mobster]
They say I got a suicidal tendency murderin' all my enemies first
It ain't no question, the thunder under my shirt
Fuck around and you'll be up under the dirt
This automatic'll turn your Hummer to a hearse
Worse case scenario, pipe bomb your burial
They gonna have to bury you twice
This scary cat on this night life
The Gulf stream private but the weed is top flight
My PO already know I'm a motherfuckin' flight risk
Heavy chain, light wrist, pay cash for everything
That white bitch (she got it, she got it) that's my words to Orenthal
Sixteen and a two liter got it lookin' like motor oil
I'm leanin' hard in that flat black turbo charged coupe on twenty-fours, pedal to the floor
One hunnid shots at a nigga, still got plenty more
Slim The Mobster and my Israeli-made Uzi
We turn your block to a motherfuckin' movie

[Chorus: Young De]
Lights, cameras, action, niggas ready to shoot (shoot)
But these ain't lights and cameras pointed at you (you)
Block off the scene 'cause your scenes don't move me
We'll turn your block into a motherfuckin' movie
Lights, cameras, action, niggas ready to shoot (shoot)
But these ain't lights and cameras pointed at you (you)
Block off the scene 'cause your scenes don't move me
We'll turn your block into a motherfuckin' movie

[Verse 3: Xzibit]
Back When We Were Kings, we were the Lord of the Rings
Requiem for a Dream, smokin' my Soylent Green
Now I know why the Cage Bird sings, there's no more Men of Honor
I'm Iron Man in my suit of armor, runnin' from karma
The Good Die Young, No Country for Old Men
There Will be Blood deeper than Leviathan
And my Platoon full of Bad Lieutenants
X-Men, Expendables, Bad Company criminals
Crush Grooves with a Kangol, Serpent And The Rainbow
48 Hours to Kill Bill, Cash and Tango
Braveheart, Battleship, Devil's Advocate with the Passion of Christ, It's A Wonderful Life
Miami Vice, what to get right
It's Midnight in the Garden the Good and Evil
I Crash Ordinary People, Lethal Weapon without four sequels
Survive the Hunger Games
The Gods Must be Crazy, Ricochet through the Purple Rain
Because The Devil Wears Prada
The Dead Presidents can turn a Goodfella to a Godfather
Animal House, Stand and Deliver The King's Speech
Leonardo DiCaprio on the beach
Ocean's Eleven if All Dogs go to Heaven
The Silence of the Lambs, Son of Sam, Seven, I am Legend
Fuck this New Jack City, I'm on the Midnight Express
With this American History X, yes

[Verse 4: Crooked I]
Off the dome and I'm talkin' slick as petroleum
'Cause I don't fuck with pens 'less I'm ballin' on some linoleum
Niggas preachin' hate from Napoleon
I'm slowly throwing salt in my game like pourin' some sodium on a goalie
But, homie, I'm only in it for the cash sport
Think you fucked the world? Somethin' like a pornstar with a passport
With Officer Walker and my side mirror in
He don't like me 'cause I'm dark as a Nigerian
Rockin' a lot of jewelry and smart as a librarian
And the look in my errogant eyes said I'd bury him
I said it before, don't ignore it again
Two hands on the Nine, like a quarter to ten, dude
Life's a hooker, the hall raised me
This poor baby was born crazy
Put in the middle of drug wars, thug lords and judges tryna to court case me
Lord, Save Me, it's Scorsese, a movie

[Chorus: Young De]
Lights, cameras, action, niggas ready to shoot (shoot)
But these ain't lights and cameras pointed at you (you)
Block off the scene 'cause your scenes don't move me
We'll turn your block into a motherfuckin' movie
Lights, cameras, action, niggas ready to shoot (shoot)
But these ain't lights and cameras pointed at you (you)
Block off the scene 'cause your scenes don't move me
We'll turn your block into a motherfuckin' movie
