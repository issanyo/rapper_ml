[Hook] Demrick
See the same things when I look around. (Look around.)
We just in the kitchen trying to cook this sound. (Cook this sound.)
Promoters hit the line, they tying to book it now. (Book it now.)
The money going up, yo, good looking out
(Good looking out! Aye!)
Yeah, good looking out
(Good looking out! Aye!)
Yeah, good looking out
(Good looking out! Aye!)
Yeah, good looking out
(Good looking out! Aye!)
Yeah, good looking out

[Verse 1] Demrick
Good looking out
‘Bout to feed the streets just like I’m cooking out. (Cooking out.)
This weed it got the bounce that make you move around. (Move around.)
Pay my debt, I got next, get the cheque and respect, roll a Woody and I’m set
Black hoody and some jewelry on my neck, that’s not to flex
For all the sacrifice, yeah I deserve to have the best
All them sleepless nights I would write while they slept
Giving you my soul, nothing more, nothing less
I need some [?] wrapped up in Cubanos, few bottles of Henny
Some consumed with envy, tell ‘em that virus is deadly
I remember nights inside of Denny’s rounding up some pennies
Now it’s Vegas for the weekend, we ain’t leaving ‘til I’m ready, yeah
Good looking out, too hard [?] seen the vision first
Good looking out, for everyone who helped me put in work
Good looking out, yeah I promise I won’t let you down
Good looking out, that’s like one up and ‘gon make it count

[Verse 2] Dizzy Wright
Bogarted my way to the top, what is you thinking? (What is you thinking?)
When that snowfall I show hard like Franklin. (Like Franklin?)
No crip or blood but this Dizzy OG banging. (Yeah it’s banging)
Sometimes I want all of the power goes to [?]
Pop in different countries, barely know the language, yeah
These loyal niggas better watch who ones they friends
Maintain it, move through life like I’m a soul rebel
Smoking signals, when you pop before that old special. (Yeah.)
I’m a whole mood, dawg I’m on my own level
Good looking out, grab the weed, fuck the phone signals
Cooking that sound, open the stove, he brought the drone with him
We need the footage, still movin’, no stopping pushing and I told em’
