[Verse 1]
I focus in, here we go again
I’ma stay on my toes til the very end
My flow is ferocious, explosive pen
Killing these shows on the road again
I’m coming for my just do, fuck you
They talk about your life, they don’t love you
And when your name Bubbles, you turn to the right, they ‘gon come with that knife, you’re in trouble
Backstabbers, chain-snatchers, cash grabbers
They ain't mention bad brains splatter, not a damn thing matter
Shouldn't have came at a nigga
Payback's a bitch and she fucks quick
Leave you up shit's creek, some six feet
Blood runs deep, but some envy
May some rest in peace than go against me
Let's get it

[Hook]
I've been going on like I've never been before (before)
Only get the best, yeah, the best that you can smoke (smoke)
Ain't no time to stress, all these blessings on the road (road)
Keep me on the go (go), they keep me on the go

I've been going on like I've never been before (before)
Only get the best, yeah, the best that you can smoke (smoke)
Ain't no time to stress, all these blessings on the road (road)
Keep me on the go (go), they keep me on the go

(They keep me on the go)
(They keep me on the go)

[Verse 2]
Clock ticking, losing minutes
What you doing with it? Me, I handle business
Hand to hand with the independent
Fans in the stands, hands up until I'm finished
Man up, go and get it
Give a damn who offended
Burning Backwoods with spinach
Living fast to the limit
Put the pass on the gimmicks
I live this
The difference 'tween me and you is you and me
I'm UFC, you WWE
I'm EBT, you EDC
Know I'm the king of everything I see
That's all work
Mixed with a little bit of God's work
I know I live forever through my hard work
Getting stoned on the couch like Ted and Mark Wahlberg
Wake up, nigga your alarm work?

[Hook]
I've been going on like I've never been before (before)
Only get the best, yeah, the best that you can smoke (smoke)
Ain't no time to stress, all these blessings on the road (road)
Keep me on the go (go), they keep me on the go

I've been going on like I've never been before (before)
Only get the best, yeah, the best that you can smoke (smoke)
Ain't no time to stress, all these blessings on the road (road)
Keep me on the go (go), they keep me on the go

(They keep me on the go)
(They keep me on the go)
(They keep me on the go)
