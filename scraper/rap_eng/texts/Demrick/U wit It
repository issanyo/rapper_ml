[Verse 1]
In the back of the BM
Bunch of bitches in my DM
Asking when I’m going to see ‘em
She said all she want is freedom
But when she drunk she starts texting her ex saying how much that she need him
Wonder why I don’t believe them
And its money over hoes and these shows could fill up a coliseum
Puffing cannabis sativa
Beats going ham in the speakers
I’m the man, I’m a leader
Got my niggas writing with me
Revolve against the city like Jiddy
She got ass and she pretty
Then she probably coming with me
Can’t build a kingdom of pity
So I’m out here getting gritty
Said the liquor made her tipsy
Never felt the leather in a Bentley
So I got to see ‘em barley
Man I wonder, can you feel me
I wonder, can you feel me
Do you understand me really?


[Hook]
U wit it, or nah
U wit it, or nah
U wit it, or nah
U wit it, or nah
U wit it, or nah
U wit it, or nah
U wit it, or nah
U wit it, or nah


[Verse 2]
Said she wish she never met me
I know she bet she can’t forget me
I knocked it out the park like Griffey
Every time my pockets empty
My minds weighs heavy, so I stay forever ready, hoes steady
As I steer clear from drama
Listen to my OutKast CD, Stankonia, smoking ganja
Have you ever heard of comma?
I ain’t talking ‘bout that stripper man I’m talking ‘bout what’s coming back on ya
I’m in love with California
Might just hit the beach up in the morning
Breath stinking while I’m yawning
Pouring liquor for the fallen
I always keep this solid
I’ma have some money for your daughters
That’s the only thing important
My fist is the coldest
Nothing like Levis and Jordan’s
Either Hare or the Tortoise
I’ma make it there
Just a millionaire from the corner


[Hook]
U wit it, or nah
U wit it, or nah
U wit it, or nah
U wit it, or nah
U wit it, or nah
U wit it, or nah
U wit it, or nah
U wit it, or nah


I’m wit it ‘cause a lot of different things in my life keep me up all night
I gotta find a light
To guide me through the rest of my days here
(U wit it, or nah)
I gotta find a way here

I’m wit it ‘cause a lot of different things in my life keep me up all night
I gotta find a light
To guide me through the rest of my days here
(U wit it, or nah)
I gotta find my way here
