(We would like to welcome you to Los Angeles)

[Verse 1]
Fresh off the plane, head to Roscoe's for waffles and wings
My first time cruising, sunset was a beautiful thing
Couple friends went corrupt in a Benz
Same corrupt that I looked up to growing up as a kid
Got my partners back in Philly asking how have I been
How you leaving your foundation, look at all that you did
But then I had a conversation with Will Smith in his crib
He said a Philly kid could come up in Cali and do it big
And shit, I’m glad I did
Been around the world and back again
All from rap and I rep Cali, bitch, no matter where the address is
North Hollywood, home of the actresses
Where niggas scheme for there dreams like strategists
Smoke some canibus to ease my mind, ain’t hard to find. I got seven different kinds
When it’s time to unwind and relax
I hit that Cali coastline, go and detach
I’m ‘bout to get that old school drop the top back
Pick up this bop, get some top
Top that

[Verse 2]
Now nine years later I called his home in the Valley 818 area code on my phone
But I rode the PCH from Malibu out to Hermosa Beach
Been in the ocean but never over a shoulder deep
I love my surfer chicks in swimsuits looking fit
Then I hit Bootsy Bellows, get up on some different shit
I’ve been smoking forever, the only difference is I’m getting corporate sponsorships from marijuana businesses
We pop bottles, smoke kush and fuck models
Uber to them Hollywood parties
Rooftop at The W, on the rocks at the Roxy
Don’t do AOD, I’m too low key for paparazzi
This California feeling got me
My Mexican mommy say [?]
You doing better than anybody
Stuck in traffic, smoking backwood, aeromatics on the 405
I stay high while I drive knocking L.A. Leakers at 923 out my speakers
There’s 10 million people in L.A
We all dreaming
