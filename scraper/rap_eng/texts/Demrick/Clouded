[Verse 1: ]
My head up in the sky again
Way up high again
Want to know what whip I'd riding in
Yeah I'm flying in
You know what time it is
I put my all on this
So what is all of this
You think you part of this?
No no no no
You wasn't their in the beginning you just showed up
Creeping in my IG thinking I'm bout to blow up
I remember all them late night trips to Dunkin Donuts
Wild and out drinking coffee flowing 'til the morning
I put my time in this to shine in this
And once I find my diamond
Best believe she getting all of this
Until then it's big booties lips filled with collard greens
All these late nights got to call them in
She ain't working but she working it for certain
If I'm your man all them DM's is curtains
You feeling like a valet you been doing so much curving
Changing all my exes now my numbers out of service
Pray everyday and don't move without a purpose

[Chorus: ]
And I been thinking all day about it
I don't want to see my life with out you
You got my mind all clouded
Look around and my minds all clouded
I been thinking all day about it
I don't want to see my life with out you
You got my mind all clouded
I look around and my minds all clouded

[Verse 2: ]
Blessed with another day spending it enjoying life
10 years grinding now she think it happen overnight
Gold grill big smile light with the over bite
In the clouds looking at the crowd for the flows I write
What a life I lead probably live this life for free
Building with the fam now the plan is monopoly
Represent a property
Treat her like a queen never seen as my property
But some trick her for the treats like Halloween
I ain't tripping I'm just focused on my following
Build into a dynasty
Go and get your pot of gold
Most gonna follow those
Spread bread by the loaf
You already ready know
Took an oath to keep it real til my casket drops
Way up their with the astronauts
I always bet on the long shots
Aiming for you 'cause you all I want

[Chorus: ]
And I been thinking all day about it
I don't want to see my life with out you
You got my mind all clouded
Look around and my minds all clouded
I been thinking all day about it
I don't want to see my life with out you
You got my mind all clouded
I look around and my minds all clouded
And I been thinking all day about it
I don't want to see my life with out you
You got my mind all clouded
Look around and my minds all clouded
