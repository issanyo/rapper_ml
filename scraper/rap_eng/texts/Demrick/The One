[Intro]
*Sample*

[Verse 1: Jarren Benton]
Yeah, bitch it's the king, crown me like I’m prince Hakeem
These niggas talkin' sideways like they gon' lynch my team
Bitches throw the pussy thinking they gon' spend my CREAM. These hoes can't even get the lint that's sitting in my jeans
Tec In The church
I bet they want the second it burst
My white bitch a dead head so I get neck in the hearse, Get it?  Such into Hootie swag  pistol in the Gucci bag
Old tray eight handle covered up with the Louie rag
Praise the lord Benton 9/11 Porsche spinning
Wine from Italy pop corks with divorced women
Send a prayer to all incarcerated Scarfaces
Niggas turn to track star when the Narcs' chase us
God shining like for brothers stuck in dark places
Rodents in the yard get shanked up with sharp razors
Gators' fit me like the pimp of the year
I throw a nigga off the plane and watch him flip from the [?]
Labels raping niggas started waking niggas, bitch I came for dinner
I watch these rappers turn to bitches like they Kaitlyn Jenner
I need a bitch with a Kardashian ass
Hit that ass flat she better have Kardashian cash
When I smash, why these bitches wanna crash in the pad?
I got money to make, bitch you better grab you a cab
Salute to Staten Island, weapon in my army jacket linin'
Grim reaper marking all these corny faggots rhyming, Motherfucker

[Hook: Demrick]
We don't show no love to enemies
No mercy for those who wanna see they end of me
Head is the bread It's the perfect recipe
Count my blessing every night before I sleep
Cause I'm the one, I'm the one
I'm the one, I'm the one

[Verse 2: Jarren Benton]
Ladies, rub your titties if you love hip-hop
I give a bitch the world if she know how to ride a stiff cock
Gucci ski-mask I make the coward run his wristwatch
OG Kush inside the ziplock we 'bout to twist Pac'
Grady baby, poverty make me crazy
Loan and disabilities mama could hardly raise me
My nIggas lIke a chemist in the kitchen
These bitches acting different and they feelings you don't fuck with Mr.Benton (Bitch)
Expensive mix, puking liquor In the kitchen sink
Gold on my teeth I make these peasants kiss these feet
Everything I drop is fire I don’t miss a beat
I'm out in Cali with my nigga Flick, Twist and Keith
My niggas hustle cuz' they job don't care for feelings
“I’m with your BM in the Caiman Islands parasailing
Gold on me like Rick the Ruler I get the Moolah
Niggas plottin I lift the tool up and and split medullas
Boogeyman benton, rappers better run from the bully
Click, clIck, blaow, told that nigga to catch me outside
I'm Negan with Lucille, I'm bout' to bash out his eyes
Still Eastside, drugs got my brain refried
It's that Wu killer shit swarming out the beehive
I bring the motherfucking ruckus, let the stainless touch 'em
These niggas softer than the center of a danish muffin

[Hook: Demrick]
We don't show no love to enemies
No mercy for those who wanna see they end of me
Head is the bread It's the perfect recipe
Count my blessing every night before I sleep
Cause I'm the one, I'm the one
I'm the one, I'm the one
