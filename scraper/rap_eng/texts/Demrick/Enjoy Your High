Enjoy your high, girl...
Everything's better when you're faded, baby

We high as shit, and you fine as shit
Smokin' on that designer shit
She go nuts when i pass the piff
So don't cuff if she tryna flip
Hot-boxin' when we in the whip
Got big kush clouds right behind the tint
So much smoke, need oxygen
I got so much stroke, she got to swim
Her ass so dumb, she don't know no better
Out in Cali with the good green and no cold weather
5 13's and my Polo sweater
Said her friend wanna smoke, so we finna go get her

Let's go...
She already got one rolled...
I love a girl that love to smoke
She always keep me one rolled
I love a girl that love to smoke
She always keep me one rolled
I love a girl that love to smoke
She always keep me one rolled
I love a girl that love to smoke
She always keep me one rolled

Enjoy your high, girl...
Everything's better when you're faded, baby
Enjoy your high, girl...
Ain't nobody here gon' judge you, baby

'cause ain't nobody on trial
No car, my name ain't on file
Still cop my sacks from the weed-man
I need two O's just for the weekend
I'm gettin' on what she peekin'
We goin' over that deep end
Just like the high, we creepin'
Relax and let it all sink in
We young, havin' fun, it can't get no better
Feelin' so good so we down for whatever
We all know that we won't live for forever
So tonight, let's say we in this together

Let's go...
She already got one rolled...
I love a girl that love to smoke
She always keep me one rolled
I love a girl that love to smoke
She always keep me one rolled
I love a girl that love to smoke
She always keep me one rolled
I love a girl that love to smoke
She always keep me one rolled

Enjoy your high, girl...
Everything's better when you're faded, baby
Enjoy your high, girl...
Ain't nobody here gon' judge you, baby

I love a girl that love to smoke (enjoy your high, girl)
I love a girl that love to smoke (everything's better when you're faded)
