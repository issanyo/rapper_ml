[Verse 1]
Where I’m at there ain’t no coming back
This cognac got my head spinning like a Laundry Mat
I’m chopping down these trees just like a lumberjack
I call my plug, I pick it up and then I double that
You niggas fall in love with hoes you ‘gon have fun with that
When you know they only love you for your money stack
You heard about my clique, we blowing money fast
My niggas coppin’ P’s you keep that 20 back

[Hook]
I’m only getting richer, can’t go back to being broke
These women put my pictures in they Instagram posts
She said she want to kick it like it’s taekwondo
Yeah she’d probably lick it like an ice cream cone
Why you playing with your texts on your phone?
Girl you should just hit me when you finally home alone
I’ma pull up, we ‘gon get it poppin’ that’s for sure
Got so many hoes I could start a freak show, oh you know how it go
You know how it go

[Verse 2]
A freak exactly what I need
A bad ass bitch that’s down for anything
She ‘gon (drop it) for a wedding ring
I told her, “baby, go ahead and let it dream”
She think that I’m the one like Billie Jean (hee hee)
‘Cause I look good smoking Cali green
I pull up on the scene on the shiny things
Got every girl swinging on my ding-a-ling

Watch it turn into a freak show on the dance floor
I’m ‘gon get you what you ask for
Make it last hoe
I’ma let you light my weed up but pass it back though
Hop into a Lambo, slide out the back door
