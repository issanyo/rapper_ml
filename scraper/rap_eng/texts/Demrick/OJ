[Verse 1] Demrick
Wake up, let your problems take a back seat
You’ve been going hard for like the last week
Hit the gym, work it out like an athlete
Tonight you run the club but your girl’s like a track meet
Hustlers motivating, get them dollars
We grew up without our fathers
Care for mothers and our daughters
We got problems but we won’t let ‘em stop us. (No way!)
She got a glass of (OJ!)
And an ass like (OK!)
Yeah, yeah
You better tap in ‘fore you tap out
Didn’t fuck with it back then now it’s packed house
Tell ‘em next year be in that house
Then them haters really got something to be mad about
Til then, it’s only good vibes, good vibes
Say them goodbyes, ‘cause it’s ‘gon be a good time tonight
DJ Hoppa on production and the table
And me on the mic, you know it’s fatal
Get the bankroll

It’s that Stoney Point 2 shit
That exclusive
Gold grill with that toothpick
Damn, baby yeah you’re too thick
Left without you on the floor and she move it, move it
It’s that Stoney Point 2 shit
That exclusive
Gold grill with that toothpick
Damn, baby yeah you’re too thick
Left without you on the floor and she move it, move it

[Demrick]
Wake up, get up
Yeah you’ve got another day
Get out, go do your thing
Make the world pay
Every time you step up kill ‘em with this flavour
Then you beat the case like O.J

[Verse 2] Gavlyn
Yeah, yeah
I love the life I’m living, yeah, I’m satisfied
No tribulations, picture perfect. Say it with some pride
You ask me if I’m down to ride already in the passengers seat?
Some ‘gon repeat, my caches are creased
I’m just a blunt away from being complete
I brought my squad with me thickly as you can see
And we sipping on that bubbly because we came a long way
A long way from bologna sandwiches in a real way
So let me tell you like this, I be that bitch
You never saw me coming til you see that shit
I let it speak for it self so let’s turn up the bitch
So that I give them what they want, boy, never a smidge
I’m on a rooftop by the [?] yelling who’s up
Don’t care who saw, shit, as long as they heard me
You smell the weed smoke, baby, where you could find me
It’s a 818 representative, come on and try me

[Hook]
[Gavlyn]
It’s that Stoney Point 2 shit
That exclusive
Gold grill with that toothpick
Damn, baby yeah you’re too thick
Left without you on the floor and she move it, move it
It’s that Stoney Point 2 shit
That exclusive
Gold grill with that toothpick
Damn, baby yeah you’re too thick
Left without you on the floor and she move it, move it

[Demrick]
Wake up, get up
Yeah you’ve got another day
Get out, go do your thing
Make the world pay
Every time you step up kill ‘em with this flavour
Then you beat the case like O.J
