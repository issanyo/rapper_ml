[Hook x2]

I'm on a roller coaster, barely move from off my sofa
Grab the drink from off my coaster, ya i'm posted out on
Space island (space island)
Blunts to the face out on space island (space island)


[Verse 1]

Now this is a journey
My vision goes blurry
I smoke so much I feel like nothing could hurt me
It's curvy, it's wavy
No troubles. All gravy
These drugs out more lately
It feels like the 80's
The 90's behind me
The thousands were crazy
Now it's just dab hits of wax on the daily
I'm faded, i'm gone. This island i'm on
Is more than a trip, I've been here too long
Miss calls on my phone
I'm in my zone
No cares for your problems
Just leave me alone
Two grams of OG straight to my dome
Got my head right, I just might call this home


[Hook x2]

I'm on a roller coaster, barely move from off my sofa
Grab the drink from off my coaster, ya i'm posted out on
Space island (space island)
Blunts to the face out on space island (space island)


[Verse 2]

At this very moment, it feels like i'm floating
I'm posted but this room is sways like the ocean
All this commotion is happening around me
It's sunny outside but my mind is so cloudy
These girls in my head but all that I hear
Is "Come to the island you'll love it up here"
This water is clear
The weather is perfect
This party's a circus. I'd rather be surfin'
These pills are not workin'
Don't grab me another
I discovered an uncovered place up above us
Right from my seat
I'm light on my feet
Just light up another
My cyphers complete


[Hook x2]

I'm on a roller coaster, barely move from off my sofa
Grab the drink from off my coaster, ya i'm posted out on
Space island (space island)
Blunts to the face out on space island (space island)
