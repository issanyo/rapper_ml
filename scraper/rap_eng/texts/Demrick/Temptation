[Hook]
I fall for temptation
It’s fucking with my patience
I fall for temptation
God, please give me patience
I fall for temptation

[Verse 1] Demrick
All these temptations clouding my mind
Pulling me off track one at a time
Losing my focus, blurring the lines
A true getaway. It ain’t easy to find
Lost in my head, bottle in hand
Thought that they’d left me for dead, damn
Woke up and did it instead, plan
I made up while smoking some head, bam
Caught in the light
Just met a girl and we fucked on the flight
Where is your manners, ain’t fucking polite?
Need to slow down like I’m stuck at a light
What do you do when the wrong feels right?
Need to ease up, your seatbelt to tight
Tomorrow’s not promised
I just let it go and follow my conscious

[Hook]
I fall for temptation
It’s fucking with my patience
I fall for temptation
God, please give me patience
I fall for temptation

[Verse 2] Kidd Upstairs
I’m zonin’
My phone dead, but wouldn’t you know it
I still get quite the reception from women voters
It’s all the same though when you don’t ever know ‘em
And they all just vote you and tell you they in the moment
They’ll say the kid is a devil but fail the omen
My body’s dying but I am mentally glowing
And if I had feelings I’d probably would never show them
You bets we blowing on weed budget, your food budget
My new fuck is a diamond driving that Blue Cutlass
My old girl is just trying to get me to do something
Different than lying ‘bout business meetings and homecoming
I feel these temptations like I was Motown
Hustlers, old sounds and turn silver linings to gold mounds

[Hook]
I fall for temptation
It’s fucking with my patience
I fall for temptation
God, please give me patience
I fall for temptation
