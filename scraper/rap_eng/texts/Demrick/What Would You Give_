[Verse 1]
Back in the Dam moving straight to the Green House
Lemon Haze, head change, hits when I leave out
It’s long flights, passports stamps and immigration
Stoney Point 2 coming through with them fan favourites
Remember me, Mr. Choppa, Hoppa beat?
Just want to own it’s masters and some property
No monopoly, this real life moves and fuck these fake ass rappers, that’s my real life mood
When you realize you, one of the greats
Couldn’t feel my shoes
No debates, but still I’ll prove
Through my catalog
War testing, check my battle scars
While most these niggas out here loving through their avatars
All seasoned, no added sauce
And this world keeps spinning so I’m burning like a bad exhaust
I had to take a loss to really see gains
To truly understand my blessings first I need pain

[Hook]
What would you give to get what you want?
Is everything you’ve gained worth all you’ve lost?
Take time to add up the cost
Figure out where them lines is crossed

What would you give to get what you want?
Is everything you’ve gained worth all you’ve lost?
Take time to add up the cost
Figure out where them lines is crossed

[Verse 2]
I’m X-ing out the negative
This daily grind can be repetitive so I roll one to calm me like a sedative
I went from couch surfing, living without purpose
To crowd surfing out in Europe as they sing my verses
And even though my future still to be determined
Everything I got, nigga, best believe I earned it
No handouts, work til it pans out
A nigga trying to get that type of money that you can’t count
So I’m camped out, late night studio sessions
Write my life so when I go they ‘gon call me a legend
And this obsession I call my craft
Yeah, it keep me on stage signing autographs
It also keep me far from home, out here living fast
So I pray when I’m alone that I never crash
Shit, I’m just trying to find my balance
This world can be crazy, it’s just how you go about it

[Hook]
What would you give to get what you want?
Is everything you’ve gained worth all you’ve lost?
Take time to add up the cost
Figure out where them lines is crossed

What would you give to get what you want?
Is everything you’ve gained worth all you’ve lost?
Take time to add up the cost
Figure out where them lines is crossed
