[Hook]
Pulled up, hands up, bands up
Whole club saying duck, Snapchat with your cameras
When they play that shit act up, wile out, back up
All the sippers get amped up
Do that, this is your anthem
(On the scene with a lean and a pocket full of green)
Do that, this is your anthem
(On the scene with a lean and a pocket full of green)
Do that, this is your anthem
(On the scene with a lean and a pocket full of green)
Do that, this is your anthem
(On the scene with a lean and a pocket full of green)
Do that, this is your anthem

[Verse 1]
Gimme mine playa and some
Ball hog, and one
I just got me a mansion and I ain’t even went platinum
Rich, I just been stacking
Double cup be acting
I’ll my shows be packed in
Fat asses is clapping
Go against me to the casket
Smell the green through the plastic
It ain’t no dance when I’m dabbing
So high there’s no landing

[Bridge]
Somebody told you, right?
I’m not the sober type
Smoking, drinking every night
That’s how I live my life

[Hook]
Pulled up, hands up, bands up

[Verse 2]
Ladies say that I’m handsome
They ‘gon probably try to kidnap him
But I don’t love ‘em, I’ll pass ‘em
No fun, the [?] can’t have none
I’m rolling up while I ash one
The last one, I can’t pass none
When the act done, when the cash come, my handgun got a tantrum
Hotline on my Samsung, Mr. Nice Guy like Samson
Turn this square into a bad one
I’m world wide with this action

[Bridge]
Somebody told you, right?
I’m not the sober type
Smoking, drinking every night
That’s how I live my life
