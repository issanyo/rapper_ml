[Demrick : Verse 1]
You ain't smoking flavors, Dont do me no favors
We high like elevators while Im highly imitated from the track that's integrated
Im with my cali native,Hoppa roll it proper non stop, forever faded
Im over dedicated,staying medicated daily. A nigga more wavy then the navy
My flow all haze, That means hell for competition. Burn a L , inhale, set sail to what I vision
I pray I make the right decision only time will tell
I just know that when I go im gon' be high as hell
I opted out the sober life, chose the roll the dice. I hold the mic, All that other shit is over hyped
This ain't happen over night, thats why im over priced like the jet fuel board a flight
Get higher then G5s when we ride its niggas in levis , white tees my mamacita cheetah in knee highs

[Chorus]
They dont know about this life we live
Eyes red my nigga
And you dont know all that I had to do
They dont know about this life we live
Eyes red my nigga and you dont know all that I had to do

[Demrick : Verse 2]
My real father in prison, step pops on parole
Momma always gone , sloppy joes up on the stove
Homies on the phone saying lets get at these hoes
So much time up in these streets im running down my soles
And its the life that I chose theres no regret here
Promised all my partners this my best year yet
Im sharper then the Gillette , told them to cut the cheque
Or fuck It ill start comin at they neck
Since I came in this world bearchest its been a mess, everyday with near death
There's nothing to fear left, I ain't shed a tear yet even though Im tried daily
Keep my mind hazy so it never drives crazy
Way im feeling lately ,nigga only god can save me. Momma told me settle down and raise some babies, Maybe
Just to see some innocence before my soul diminishes, story of my life im trying to figure how to finish it

[Chorus]
They dont know about this life we live
Eyes red my nigga
And you dont know all that I had to do
They dont know about this life we live
Eyes red my nigga and you dont know all that I had to do
