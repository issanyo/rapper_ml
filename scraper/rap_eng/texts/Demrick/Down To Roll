[Verse 1]
Yeah she want to kick it (let’s kick it.)
Got some shit on her mind
No, I never came off it
I was born for this grind
And damn girl, you a dime
Shit, I need you on my line
Since I seen you from behind
You fine girl, you fine girl
Let’s take a drink of this Hennessy (poor up.)
Let’s roll a little bit of this weed up (roll up.)
Catch a buzz with me tonight
Ain’t worried ‘bout your man (I ain’t worried ‘bout shit.)
If you even got one
Wanna bang bang, are you down like a shotgun?
Come and get the job done
Let’s get on one

[Bridge]
Yeah, let me at you right now. Right here, right now
Right here, right now, right now
Right here, right now, right now
I want you right here, right here, right now, right now
Said I want you right here, right here, right now, right now

[Hook]
She say she down, she down to roll
Light it up, enjoy the smoke
Bottom girl all bathed in gold
Ohh
She love to ride it back and forth
Speed it up and take it slow
Break it down and let it go
Oh, she might lose control
Oh, she might lose control

[Verse 2]
Let’s put it all in perspective. This world could be ours in second
With that body that you got, you been on with a weapon
Thinking mom deserves ‘honourable mention’
We just roll up to kill, Netflix and chill then it’s back to the feel
It’s hard to forget when that ass is so real
When I smash it so real
She caught up in the fast lane, fast life, yeah, them bright lights
See I don’t judge, go ‘head party baby I don’t club
Just bring me weed, Hennessy and drugs and we good for the night
We’ll keep it hood for the night
You are right up on the hood if you like
Just roll up another and pass me a light
We higher than two satellite

[Bridge]
Yeah, let me at you right now. Right here, right now
Right here, right now, right now
Right here, right now, right now
I want you right here, right here, right now, right now
Said I want you right here, right here, right now, right now

[Hook]
She say she down, she down to roll
Light it up, enjoy the smoke
Bottom girl all bathed in gold
Ohh
She love to ride it back and forth
Speed it up and take it slow
Break it down and let it go
Oh, she might lose control
Oh, she might lose control

[Verse 3]
Don’t lose control from these late nights
The wild parties and the long flights
Caught in this crazy thing called life, so we live like we don’t get twice
We just riding a wave, finding our way
Light up a J. No need for talking, your body explain
The neighbours come knocking, we rock in the frame
Smoking that Jet Fuel, I caught me a plane
I caught me a plane
Mama said, “De, ‘fore you get in this game, you will not be the same.”
And that shit is just true
I’m sitting with you and you’re here with me
We blowing the streets, shit we just like the breeze
Let’s take it up a couple more degrees
That fire inside of you is burning to please

[Bridge]
Yeah, let me at you right now. Right here, right now
Right here, right now, right now
Right here, right now, right now
I want you right here, right here, right now, right now
Said I want you right here, right here, right now, right now

[Hook]
She say she down, she down to roll
Light it up, enjoy the smoke
Bottom girl all bathed in gold
Ohh
She love to ride it back and forth
Speed it up and take it slow
Break it down and let it go
Oh, she might lose control
Oh, she might lose control
