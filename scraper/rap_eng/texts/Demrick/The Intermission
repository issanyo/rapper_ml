[Intro: Dizzy Wright]
Stepping into mind

[Verse 1: Euroz]
Uh
Niggas that could stop it I ain't seeing many
Prophecies of multi millions off the weed and henney
Love where I'm from but I got dreams that exceed the city
I was told to take my shot now I'm squeezing empty
No game shoot up charts like they beefing with me
Drop classics for the free and never seen a penny
Stayed on course avoiding anything that lead to envy
Niggas said they made me I'm waiting for them to reinvent me
Don't ask questions about niggas if you ain't seen them with me
I'm hungry like Birdman before the flee the Bentleys
Real genius talking Basquiat me Da Vinci
Airing out my problems should've breeze everything events see
Grindings key man they can't knock the hustle
Feel like I'm doing curls when a nigga lift the duffel
I ain't worried about noise I come from outside the huddle
Needless to say they hate the least of my troubles

[Verse 2: Demrick]
Yeah the green I'm bagging fire like a breathing dragon
My baby with the back in and know I love my salmon blackened
Staying healthy on a punk bitch
Pull up with a stick my Vegas niggas taught me life off the strip
Hundred six in the shade rainy days do not exist
Bad bitches in my DM with the slay I got a list
Half these niggas taking credit pump fake and no assist
That's why they getting passed up
Yeah yeah
And I ain't playing a psychologist
But I can forecast rain in the club tonight like meteorologist
See me and them is opposites
So take your shit back with some confidence
Stop dwelling on accomplishments
'Cause Still Moving is the motto
Money in the convo
I can give you my open heart and a open bottle
For telling you straight I've been living like there ain't no tomorrow
And God ain't take me yet
So ain't no baby steps
Let them niggas live with that

[Verse 3: Reezy]
I've been on [?]
Still make the plays votes in the top 10
Counting up to being my response to how you been
Selling off the Benz tellilittle mama come on in
Say she tryna win I got some game that I can lend
24K hit your face when I grin
My records roulette I'm cashing in off the spins
In the stu late 2k off the hen
Smoking Dizzy OG before it came out dispense
I'm getting blowed
I've been lighting and it lighting my soul
We them guys shit they don't want you to know
Hot boy but I swear I stick to the code
Man it's too late to love a nigga when I'm gone so do it now
Gave a pack and moving pounds
But I'm still moving sound
Hating on the new edition tell them boy to cool it down
[?] came here and my niggas rule the town

[Verse 4: Dizzy Wright]
Yo
Focus on the inner circle we the half nots
We ain't get our passports to be the mascots
Liquor companies got involved for the cash crops
They had a sip and now they want the last drop
I'm get it as I'm having these sit downs with niggas
But you can't Netflix and chill just to get down with niggas
Yo from birth they try to tell us what the Earth is
So we found out what the real meaning of church is
Yo they give us certificates for their service
But they don't care until it's urgent
But yo I'm clean like detergent
Yo what you trading for the purchase
Watch what you say 'cause there some things you can't take back
Yo
Surviving ain't web surfing
I'm living a vivid dream yo where my super hero cape at
I'm tryna save lives aye yo my blunt rolled up in a Golden Age wrap
You can say that I may laps
Made slaps and see the bread up in my chasaps
I'm making quick plays I quick pay that
Sold it to niggas hearing neighbors tryna erase raps
So from 4/20 to 444 I'm only Jay slaps
I know I presented them with potential
I ain't Jigga I can't hit them with a title yet
But I'll make my idol sweat
Off the crossover dribble
Yo my bars are going to hit them later like a side effect
