[Intro: Price]
Catch a vibe, slide the coat
Flood the night, ooh no, yeah

[Chorus: Price]
Catch a vibe, slide the coat
Flood the night, feel the room
Don't blow my high, don't spill the juice
Flood the night, feel the room
Stay up (stay up, stay up)
Flood the night, kill the mood
Stay up (stay up, stay up)
Flood the night, feel the room

[Verse 1: Reezy]
Pulled up, let me catch a vibe, diamonds on me flood the night
Drippin' on them faded high, I'ma go and touch the sky
Bad bitch with me, ain't my boo, she just came to feel the room
Shawty know what we gon do, It's heatin' up like end of June
Wavy like the sentimental, drummer but I play with bands
Woke up then I hit the block, like I came up from Legoland
Side to side I slide the coupe, push a button hide the roof
Got us made in hot pursuit, I guess that's what a vibe'll do

[Verse 2: Dizzy Wright]
Mountainville, mansion function crackin', we brought ounces too
Backyard boogie busy, OG hoodies, we Clark County crew
Got the coupe, ain't nobody leavin', ain't nobody move
Told my bitch like this, we hopped off them ships, tryna

[Chorus: Price]
Catch a vibe, slide the coat
Flood the night, feel the room
Don't blow my high, don't spill the juice
Flood the night, feel the room
Stay up (stay up, stay up)
Flood the night, kill the mood
Stay up (stay up, stay up)
Flood the night, feel the room

[Verse 3: Demrick]
Yeah oh I'm 'bout to overflow, but I stay afloat
Baby rock the boat, feel the stroke
Oh I'm crashin' like the coast now
Best believe that I done live a life to boast man
Wet water drippin' while I'm dippin' through coast then

[Verse 4: Emilio Rojas]
I ain't slept in weeks, no tengo sueno, tengo sueno
Ridin' 'round I'm on the southside, I'm with the whole gang and we not surenos
Lil mami sittin' by me, light skinned she from Venezuela
She love it when I get deep with her, with the penetration in the conversation, no
She know that I got a few secrets, she gon' get hot when I keep it low
She lookin' at me like Emilio, dimelo, dimelo, dimelo
I don't be lettin' nobody get in, they just gettin' in on a need to know
She strippin' on the passenger seat, turnin' a whip into a peep show
But I

[Chorus: Price]
Catch a vibe, slide the coat
Flood the night, feel the room
Don't blow my high, don't spill the juice
Flood the night, feel the room
Stay up (stay up, stay up)
Flood the night, kill the mood
Stay up (stay up, stay up)
Flood the night, feel the room
