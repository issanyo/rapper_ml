[Intro: Demrick]
There really ain't no other way to do it
Imma work hard er'ry day
We gone' do it major
Reezy on the beat
The haters can do it major later

[Hook: Demrick]
Woah, wait, hold up, run it
Since day one a nigga always been a hunnid
From a dollar and a dream to some hundreds
With some homies on the scene getting blunted
Woah, wait, hold up, run it
Since day one a nigga always been a hunnid
From a dollar and a dream to some hundreds
With some homies on the scene getting blunted

Me and my team gone' hustle, make major paper
Work hard at this game then we ball like some major players
Like my women, like weed, baby I'm tasting all the flavors (woah)
You could be major later
Hater

[Verse 1: Demrick]
Watch me kill them with the convo
I fuck with Vegas, shit, I might just get a condo
I hit Jamaica, roll some weed up in a font though [?]
No grass for the snakes I keep my lawn low
Livin' fast, no brakes I'm in the lawn mode [?]
I used to hustle for some rims and a car note
Now I hustle like the end's come tomorrow
Use my pen to drop gems on a lost soul
Spend my time at the crossroads, no lie
My women friends in the bed playing both sides
Rappers are all washed up like low tide
How you see the bigger picture? Lens on Low-Fi
I'll take mine off top if you don't mind
And how you 'bout to do it major if you don't grind?
This is more than a cosign
Cause I left my haters roadside
The real ones don't die

[Hook: Demrick]
Woah, wait, hold up, run it
Since day one a nigga always been a hunnid
From a dollar and a dream to some hundreds
With some homies on the scene getting blunted
Woah, wait, hold up, run it
Since day one a nigga always been a hunnid
From a dollar and a dream to some hundreds
With some homies on the scene getting blunted

Me and my team gone' hustle, make major paper
Work hard at this game then we ball like some major players
Like my women, like weed, baby I'm tasting all the flavors
You could be major later
Hater

[Verse 2: Reezy]
Aye, you could be major later, hater
Wait up, look, I done got my weight up
Made it all off the scraps the gave us
Now they the ones that's asking favors
Funny how tables turned
Can't lose when you play to learn
Run game like David Stern
Yo' bitch wanna fuck, told her wait her turn
You can be major later
On B-Town like Flava Flava
I'm getting foolish paper
Floyd Mayweather my neighbor
And I got my team on
Shining like neon
Kept a hunnid since day one
The haters want the A/C on
No

[Hook: Demrick]
Woah, wait, hold up, run it
Since day one a nigga always been a hunnid
From a dollar and a dream to some hundreds
With some homies on the scene getting blunted
Woah, wait, hold up, run it
Since day one a nigga always been a hunnid
From a dollar and a dream to some hundreds

[Verse 3: Lil Debbie]
Always been a hunnid, flow is 5150
Little bitches thinkin' they can stick with me, tell 'em hit me
I follow the code created a different mold
Created a different lane
Baddest bitch on the road
They can't see me, got them black tints
Peelin' off they just following my track prints
Thats why I'm still lapping bitches when I back sprint
Bitch my head it still litty of a dab hit
Fuck a blueprint make a blackprint
Cash out, 'nother hundred racks spent
Goalies always shitting on my passion
You can kiss my ass bitch
Used to talk shit, now they see me
Made a fucking point like a free throw, easy
Plenty greens
I get it by any means
These fake bitches is shook
The realest that they done seen
And you can taste the flavor cause I'm serving like a waiter
On the road to the paper
Bitches salty cause we major (Nigga)

[Hook: Demrick]
Woah, wait, hold up, run it
Since day one a nigga always been a hunnid
From a dollar and a dream to some hundreds
With some homies on the scene getting blunted
Woah, wait, hold up, run it

Like my women, like weed, baby I'm tasting all the flavors
