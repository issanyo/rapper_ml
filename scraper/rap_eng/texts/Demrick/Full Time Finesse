[Verse 1] Demrick
We dollar dreaming, dollar billing, we dollar chasing. (Yeah.)
That dollar turn us into feelings with no explanation. (Not at all.)
No representation, you ain't getting reparations
When they set you free they leave a stain up on your reputation
How we 'gon make it? There's some fucked up administration
They running up in high schools with both guns blazing
Signs of the time, huh? You believe that lie, huh?
They keep us online wasting time. I'm 'bout to lose my fucking mind, bruh
I'm just letting, I'm just stressing, trying to figure it out
Life lessons, they're depressing, I'ma dig my way out
I'm smoking like a short rib on the grill that I can't eat 'cause they say the meat we got ain't even real
How I'm supposed to feel? Backed in the corner?
They want us back on the corner. Bag and tag me a goner
I'm a loner, I'm a stoner, I'm a rapper doing phoners
But a man first. Remember that 'fore they put those purses on us
And I'm gone

[Hook] Demrick
This a full time finesse
They yelling, "Watch what you say boy, it's cause and effect!"
It's that full time finesse
I want my piece of mind, how you describe success?
Let me guess

It's a full time finesse
When the dots finally connect they want us in these projects
And yes
It's a full time finesse
Working full time against, us

[Verse 2] Mike Lee
Who is you really when we pulling back all the curtains?
Bitch niggas, looking for handouts, that's for certain
Missed a call from my cousin locked up in County hurtin'
Losing touch in my family, music is my diversion
On a mission that's full collision, I am persistent
I am the bomb that will turn this world apocalyptic
How you get away with murder when we got forensics?
Camera phones, dash cams, but still I am
Profiled, gunned down, throw flowers on me
Tommy shot up the school, but he gon' see his mommy
How can you be on standby and not feel violated?
Stay woke to the signs, this is annihilation
My fellow brothers in insurrection, this goes deeper than complexion
Despite all your efforts we don't receive the message
De-mine me, I ain't a reverend, my friends don't get oppression
I know that I learned my lesson, you fail or you keep finessing!
