[Intro]
One thing's for sure, marijuana has changed since the 60's
(This is not your fathers pot)
It may be called the same thing and smoked the same way

Called the same thing and smoked the same way (x2)

[Verse 1]
Niggas got PHDs and THC
Chronicology
This is not your fathers weed
Amsterdam Red light district green house
Space case, livin' haze, blaze it down
Cali zone, valley grown, How you stoned?
Smoking super potent
And the high lasts very long
Chee-Cheech and Chong
Hit my bong then we gone
We got dabs up for grabs
If it's on then it's on

[Hook x2]

Mary Jane ain't the same bitch
That she used to fuck with back in the days
She'd a changed

Niggas caught on to the game
Now they bring her up a different way
She'd a changed

[Verse 2]
One things for sure she ain't the same as before
Got a hundred different strains, different names at the store
Looking at a bag of chronic like a saw a dinosaur
Leave that outside at the door
We don't smoke that shit no more
Seen that OG kush, that's the bitch i'm looking for
She's my red headed whore with the [?]
She got the expensive taste I know that most can't afford
But she'll take you on a trip, take a hit, come aboard
Sometimes when i'm on tour she ain't around so I cheat
Break another bitch down, spread her out on the sheet
Only smoking that preferred, nothing found on the street
While you bitches got seeds and know brown on the leaves
I know way back in the 60's it was all about [?]
Nowadays we got wax. Add it all in the key
When my uncle told me he was smoking way before me
Told him sit his ass down, roll up, let me see

[Hook x2]

Mary Jane ain't the same bitch
That she used to fuck with back in the days
She'd a changed

Niggas caught on to the game
Now they bring her up a different way
She'd a changed
