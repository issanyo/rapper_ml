They say you talking crazy, talking reckless, that's that real shit
They say that I ain't stunting, pop a wheelie, do a real trick
I go get the money, double that, now that's a real flip
Welcome to the zoo, bitch, I call that a real trip

[Demrick]
Ever been to the jungle? (No love)
Brought up in a struggle?
It's a Cut, Throat, World, bitch, ain't nobody love you

Ever been to the jungle? (No love)
Brought up in a struggle?
It's a Cut, Throat, World, bitch, ain't nobody love you

[Verse 1] Demrick
I've been thinking 'bout it lately. (What?)
My life is getting crazy. (Why?)
I just got topped off then I dropped her off in a brand-new Mercedes
My music like dope in the 80s. (It is.)
They don't want smoke, they ventilating
Thoughts they gonna pop before the pavement
My thoughts take a pop to turn the payments
Niggas be walking entertainment, all caught up in the matrix
Ain't got a plan 'cause they play they self
I be watching in amazement
When they get that affidavit, and see the name on the stages. (Oh no.)
I thought my own homies never snitched on me, man their last words are famous
That's why all my steel is stainless and you get used to killing strangers
And I pop pills to feel painless. Label this: Young, Wild and Dangerous
Yeah I'm fresh out of famous, calling this animal behavior
But what you expect? You think they regret when they locked us in the cages?
Huh?

[Bridge] Demrick
I'ma tell you like these streets told me
It's a Cut, Throat, World
Make it hard for you to breathe

I'ma tell you like these streets told me
It's a Cut, Throat, World
Make it hard for you to breathe

[Verse 2] Demrick
They want us all to suffocate
They want us all to lose our way
They want us locked up so they can watch us and tell us how to spend our days
But no, not, me. Me no pay that
I go out and make stacks
Switch me lane in Maybach
Yeah, yeah they let us head, nigga crazy, no no, not at all
Making moves for the calls
Hate to see a nigga ball
I'm starting to feel like LeBron
80 rounds in the drum
Give me 808s in the drum
Make the bitches go dumb in the club
And you know what I need now
My head up in these clouds
Help me calm the fuck down
Bitch I'm 'bout to wile out
'Cause they keep it stressing and this shit depressing from the president to inner-city section
We living in a ticking time-bomb 'bout to detonate at any second
