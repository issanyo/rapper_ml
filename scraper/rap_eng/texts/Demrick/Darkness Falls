[Verse 1] Demrick
The real deal for real, the Real McCoy, boy
I be fucking you, get fucked like an altar boy
Shock them all when the troops deploy
Seek destroy, big boy toys, when I ride out
Slide out with a hand pan down in my hideout
Know you got a nigga, give a damn if he find out
NASCAR speed, I break down the weed
You got my ride, and I pay my fee
Then I’ma make ‘em put their hands where my eyes can see
Crowd surfing on their ass like c'est la vie
I was serving on first dabs since the age thirteen
But I wear like a badge, I’ma sight to see
You cannot ignore me, front page story
Shoot it out with the cops in a blaze of glory
I’m massive, murderous, savage CORI
You a lab rat locked in my laboratory
Now


[Hook] Brevi

Darkness falling, sky involved
And clouds of smoke, surrounded, hopeless
Ain’t no jokes no more, we chosen
And we’re coming for you
Praise the lowered
Taking over
We were made into soldiers of the [?]


[Verse 2] Xzibit
Like a mongoose to a snake
Like a snake to a little rat
Follow tracks, I can smell your heart when it pitter pats
[?] get and gat
By all means please carry that with ya
Comin’ to get ya
And sit through what’s written in scripture
Everlasting life, cup of Christ, holy water, elixir
It burn when it go down. Throw down like a showdown
For now niggas slow down before my sound surrounds you
And take pot shots at your snot box
‘Till your head start to bounce around and circle like a hot rock
From the block to whenever forever begins
I am a pirate, slowly killing you from within
You just a tapeworm, parasite, hydnellum
My appetite, carnivorous. I’m ready to binge
Now bow your heads and grace then pray for my sins
For getting under your skin like a dirty syringe

Darkness falling, sky involved

[Verse 3] B-Real
Immediate lead weed with these, hit another speed
Burning the green trees, the arms got a green leaf symbol
You keep seen but scene is like a horror flick
Murder streak team, we feed for this sort of shit
Flip the quarter quick, pick how you want to go
Write a note, it won’t be sorry, let your mama know
You had a plan with your life and how it oughta go
Homie the game changed and life threw an [?]
Nothing but blood stains remains in the cemetery
Inflicting the hurt, but your pain ain’t hereditary
It’s psychological, method is diabolical
You want to know, we break it down to a particle
From the sincerest [?], Lifting your spirits
Only to bring ‘em down. See I’m a clown with no frown
Leave a grin when I come around
Similar spins as the heater spit another round

And clouds of smoke, surrounded, hopeless
Ain’t no jokes no more, we chosen
And we’re coming for you
