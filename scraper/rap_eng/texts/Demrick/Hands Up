[Verse 1]
Right now niggas tryna stand out just to fit in
Bitches thirst, trapping on their gram, everybody slittin'
Our president use 140 characters for trippin'
Police, they pull the triggers like that shit don't make a difference
God damn, shit got me confused
What the fuck you mean, you only did it for the views?
Whole world sleeping, now they hitting on the snooze
Shit changed, Kanye's music ain't as good as his shoes are
Glued to YouTube like the team
Drink a bottled water, $3 for the fee
Every day on social media fiending
There's a underline player hidden where the fiends be
Hustle hard get the dope, sweat out the weed
I made my dreams come true without a genie
Gold chains, couple bands, pants that's steezy
Call me Demrick or Young Deezy

[Hook]
Watching other people make moves, I never understood it
Call the studio the kitchen the way a nigga be cooking
Big smile 'cause I did what they said I couldn't
Big bank account, look how far a nigga took it
Cops is crooked as the pictures at my granny's house
Good to see somebody coming up from the hand-me-downs
No hand outs, had to take the man route
Hands up, shots fired, man down

[Outro]
Hands up
Keep 'em up where I can see 'em, hands up
Keep your hands high, hands up
Keep 'em up high where I can see 'em, hands up
Hands up
Keep 'em up where I can see 'em, hands up
Keep your hands high, hands up
Keep 'em up high where I can see 'em, hands up
Hands up
