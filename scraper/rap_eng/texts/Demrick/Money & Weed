[Intro]
Yo Young De
Check this out B
I was out one night
Out in east LA, Doing my thing
About to go drop this hot 16
Go in the store buy some Zig Zags
And a 40oz, And a brutha asked me
Yo what’s up with Young De
He swears he nice, huh
I said no, no, no
Bro chill out the brutha
Don’t swear he nice
He knows he nice

[Verse 1]
Yeah she on the dick and she wanna fuck
Never, never ever will I get enough
Pussy, pussy on the mind, damn she fine
I’m about to tear that up
Break the seal off a pack of Backwoods
Kush is that good, I should smoke papers
Fuck it, I guess I gotta roll another one later
And another one, another one
Ignore the yawdy ya ya fresher than a pair of adidas
Lawdy da da
Party won’t stop, got it on top
Did it my way
Rock another show and hit the highway
Hot box while we drive
We arrive a couple hours late but that’s the high-way
Get the money, money, stack it up
Higher than a whole
Bunch of fliers, go and get that good kush
Hit the booth and set the whole fucking world on fire
Grab a lighter cause that shit sound like a very very good plan
Wonder will they ever understand
That we hold the whole world in our hands

[Hook]
Roll it and light it and pass it around
Watch me get high with my feet on the ground
Up, up, away, yea this could save my day
I do this for me, I don’t care what they say
No sticks and no stems and no seeds in between
Bong or blunt it don’t matter to me
When I say go green you know what I mean
That’s money and money and money and weed

[Verse 2]
Everyday 'til the day I don’t wake up
I'ma do me, roll and bake up
On my Biggie shit I need an ounce and a bad bitch
That could hook a steak up
Going through the bullshit but I’m cool
All I gotta do is light it, take a pull
First hit got me chill like I spent the whole day
Laying out by the pool
But I’m always on the move
Gotta get this money man
Need a couple hundred grands, after taxes
Couple houses, couple cars, that’s all that I’m asking
Fuck waiting on the back end, if it ain’t a broad that i’m smashing
Pay me up front this ain’t dumb luck nigga i’m gonna cash in

[Hook]
Roll it and light it and pass it around
Watch me get high with my feet on the ground
Up, up, away, yea this could save my day
I do this for me, I don’t care what they say
No sticks and no stems and no seeds in between
Bong or blunt it don’t matter to me
When I say go green you know what I mean
That’s money and money and money and weed
