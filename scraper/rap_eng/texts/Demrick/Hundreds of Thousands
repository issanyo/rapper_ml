[Intro: Demrick]
For everybody that likes to get high and have a good time
This song's for you

[Hook: Dizzy Wright]
Two step with a blunt in my mouth
Legendary stoner, I am one of them now
I'm on tour, I've been running around
I need hundreds and hundreds of thousands
Two step with a blunt in my mouth
Legendary stoner, I am one of them now
I'm on tour, I've been running around
I need hundreds and hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of thousands
I need hundreds and hundreds of thousands
I need hundreds and hundreds of thousands
Hundreds and hundreds of thousands
Hundreds and hundreds of thousands

[Verse 1: Demrick]
I need a hundred thousand fans with their hands up
I take a hundred thousand gram for the bad times
And use it to celebrate all these good days
Maintain the same, there's no way that I could change
Made it out the hood fame, landed on the plane
Out in LA where B-Real blessed me with the best strains
That jet fuel flight get it over night
Thirty-eight no debate, we don't change the price
And that Dizzy OG got me feeling right
I'mma need an OZ just to feed the hype
Best believe I got money on my mind
Put that petty shit down to the side
Light it up, one time

[Hook: Dizzy Wright]
Two step with a blunt in my mouth
Legendary stoner, I am one of them now
I'm on tour, I've been running around
I need hundreds and hundreds of thousands
Two step with a blunt in my mouth
Legendary stoner, I am one of them now
I'm on tour, I've been running around
I need hundreds and hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of thousands
I need hundreds and hundreds of thousands
I need hundreds and hundreds of thousands
Hundreds and hundreds of thousands
Hundreds and hundreds of thousands

[Verse 2: Dizzy Wright]
The whole world want this marijuana legalized
I just wanna make five-hundred K for the needed times
The streets is mine, I seen this opening lane
Now they're smoking my strain, well now its time to open my shop
Fuck it, I'm feeling motivated, love it or not
Me and the homies finna give y'all homies something to watch
I'm talking a hundred-thousand grams, that's all
Double up, plus four, I need my weed money back, plus more
Yeah y'all know the deal, the realest that we ain't giving up
Look me and Demrick, we was plotting at the Denver Cup
Now we on the road, legendary stoners getting stoned
And none of my growers ever be in a rush
Knew if you need it, go and get, just believe it first
Marijuana for the people, keep the people first
Maintain it to keep it, we all needed the work
Dizzy OG for the G alert, as I hit my

[Hook: Dizzy Wright]
Two step with a blunt in my mouth
Legendary stoner, I am one of them now
I'm on tour, I've been running around
I need hundreds and hundreds of thousands
Two step with a blunt in my mouth
Legendary stoner, I am one of them now
I'm on tour, I've been running around
I need hundreds and hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of thousands
I need hundreds and hundreds of thousands
I need hundreds and hundreds of thousands
Hundreds and hundreds of thousands
Hundreds and hundreds of thousands
