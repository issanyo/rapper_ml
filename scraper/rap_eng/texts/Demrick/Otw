[Verse 1]
I’m doing me
You can dream about it
Tonight I’ma smoke ‘till I’m really clouded
Drink ‘till I can’t think
That’s what I call fuel in the gas tank
I roll with a crew and we Class A
About to do this shit ‘till my last day
I remember when they said “don’t rap” but ooo
They changed that too when the cash came
When that new ass came, I left my old favors
So ungrateful, boy, champagne
Gives me hangovers, but I can’t stay sober
In the studio composing like Beethoven
I’m so reckless
Spent my cheque on a gold necklace
20 deep, we took the whole section
There’s no question
You hating ass niggas get no attention
We flexin’


[Hook]
It feels so good to make these bad decisions
I’m driving full speed towards a head on collision
I don’t know what happened to my intuition
It’s out the window and I’m on a good one, (yay yay)

I’m on a good one, (yay yay)
I’m on a good one
It’s out the window and I’m on a good one, (yay yay)
I’m on a good one, (yay yay)
I’m on a good one
It’s out the window and I’m on a good one, (yay yay)


[Verse 2]
No worries, no cares
I know some girls that want to go there
And they bad too
A bill make you feel like you can’t do
Anything
I’m in a heavy haze
Ride around town with the Chevy raised
You skip class, nigga, several days
Pushing that kush to help you levitate
Get your story straight
Yeah I medicate. Oh, you can’t relate?
Got nowhere to go on a Saturday?
Well I’m seven days a week out in outer space
Full speed with no breaks
Stopped giving a fuck when they started showing up to my shows
Giving it up, man fuck these hoes
Let’s get this money and go get stoned
Yeah, I’m on
Nigga I’m gone


[Hook]
It feels so good to make these bad decisions
I’m driving full speed towards a head on collision
I don’t know what happened to my intuition
It’s out the window and I’m on a good one, (yay yay)

I’m on a good one, (yay yay)
I’m on a good one
It’s out the window and I’m on a good one, (yay yay)
I’m on a good one, (yay yay)
I’m on a good one
It’s out the window and I’m on a good one, (yay yay)
