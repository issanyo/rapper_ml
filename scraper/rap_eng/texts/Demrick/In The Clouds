[Verse 1]
This a different kind of high
I don't know if I could ever come down from it
You're my only supply
So I'ma spend my nights right here
I be up so high
I be up, I be up, I be in the sky
You take me out, this happens here baby
I don't know if I could ever come down

[Hook]
I'm in the clouds
And I don't even know when I come down
I'm lost, I'm lost, I'm lost in these clouds
No one else up here but me and you
We're lost, we're lost, we're lost up in the clouds

Damn, I'm high as fuck
Damn, I'm high as fuck
Is you high?
Damn

[Verse 2]
I should holla at Currency to put me on that jet line
Maybe Wiz could hook me with some paper planes
What a bitty, can I ball on that G6?
'Cause I want to get back to you
Virgin, Delta, Jet Fuel
See they don't take me high like you do
They ain't been where we've been
Girl, all I need is you

[Hook]
I'm in the clouds
And I don't even know when I come down
I'm lost, I'm lost, I'm lost in these clouds
No one else up here but me and you
We're lost, we're lost, we're lost up in the clouds

[Verse 3]
Yeah I'm known for rolling up, and blowing up
But you might just have to hold me up, til I sober up
Yeah I'm grown-man status, got my four arms tatted
But you lead me here, now my mind is on another planet
And I don't know if I'ma come down, down, down
Just take another hit and pass it 'round, 'round, 'round
Got me astronaut high, see my head up in the sky
See that ass got me hypnotized
Can I get that one, more, time

[Hook]
I'm in the clouds (You have me in the clouds)
And I don't even know when I come down (I'm never coming down, down, down)
I'm lost, I'm lost, I'm lost in these clouds (I'm lost in these clouds)
No one else up here but me and you (It's just me and you girl)
We're lost, we're lost, we're lost up in the clouds
