[Verse 1]:

I’m doing 2 a days I’m on a late shift
We wrist whipping up the cake mix
I’m in the kitchen cook wit my niggas
Like them days pack up in the basement

Keep a couple bitches in rotation
We call that trap entertainment
Got a hundred thousand in the safe
I just staring at it in amazement

But this millionaire motivation
Either really blinded or they hating
But either way fuck this industry best believe I’m bout keep’em waiting

I got them Fans in the stands
Got the bitches off the gram
Have’em backstage on the cam
But Shit they’re all up for grabs

Going max on the sav
Niggas cuffing they in sad mode
I’m a treat rap like the bando
While you getting yo cash slow

I’m smoking my own weed
Stoney Point OG send it OT
And you could probably get an OZ
For the low fee if you know me

If not nigga full price, what the Fuck I Look Like
I just x'ed out my fake friends
Save goodbye’s po Henny for the good times

I can't do that negative shit
I will not do the Hattin
I will not do that smile in your face
Backstabbing combination

[Chorus 1]:

What the Fuck I Look Like?
Huh?!

What the Fuck I Look Like?
Huh?!

What the Fuck I Look Like?
Doing what they do
Nah that shit ain’t the move
Get the paper play it cool
Oooo

What the Fuck I Look Like?
Saying what they say
Nah that shit ain’t the wave
Stay paid and out the way
Ok

Now niggas wishing that they had the vision
Go against him was a bad decision
Money stacking we some mathematicians
And we only adding ain’t no division

Fuck I look like worrying bout the next man huh?
I’m Jimmy Hendrix with the acid tabs and the head band psychedelic with the mic in the left hand
Go against you a dead man
9 on the night stand
Right next to your girlfriend
Fuck’em all till the world end

Wasn’t here the whirlwind hit
Niggas coming wit them bullshit lists
But ask about’em next year and I bet that them names don’t exist

What the Fuck I Look Like?

What the Fuck I Look Like?
Huh?!

What the Fuck I Look Like?
Doing what they do
Nah that shit ain’t the move
Get the paper play it cool

Oooo

What the Fuck I Look Like?
Saying what they say
Nah that shit ain’t the wave
Stay paid and out the way
Hay
