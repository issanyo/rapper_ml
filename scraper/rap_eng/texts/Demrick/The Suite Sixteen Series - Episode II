[Verse 1: Dizzy Wright]
Only 5 foot 7 but keep the big boy blunts
Thuggin’ on a fuck nigga like you a bitch don't jump
Flexed a little with the Draymond style
But I'm A1 now
It ain't nothin' for me to lay y'all down
They locked us up, but we managed to keep the Akon smile
Now I keep living the same day they gunned Trayvon down
Over here it’s getting harder to try to block our reality
New and improved hood hoopers think they Jaquan now
You know you lost when you start chasing that reality check
Come back in a decade with a [?]
Ashy and wet
From the rain back in the golden age era
Writing rhymes before T.V. played Tia & Tamera
Now go home and roger that
I'm feeling like James Harden bringing the Rockets back
Doing my dance moves like Usher with the stocking cap
Still Movin, we a foundation too, aye Euroz bring DJ Drama back
I ain't seen him since the Freshman Cypher
Around the time LeBron and Wade was M.I.A
When there was known and leaked secrets from the N.S.A
Four years later you got Trump tryna extradite em'
Yo it's burnt out how this turnt out
But I'm finna light the rock off the pre-workout
Give an OG insight with every blunt I burn
My flow slicker than a young jock perm
Dizzy Wright nigga

[Verse 2: Demrick]
It's backed up in the [?] with the word flow
You know the code keep it cleaner then some church clothes
See it and they [?] walk with fake news
You can’t take credit for niggas that actually pay dues
And you know they say home is where the heart is at
When it’s war, I be at your door, that’s a heart attack
And that weed you got is trash, that’s a garbage bag
I ain’t apart a that
Go check the stats you don't need an armagnac
I'm pushing peace but I’m known to blat
A fucking beast when I’m on the track
Most of these rappers come with alternate facts
Brains fried from spending too much time on their apps
And yeah I heard your music once, never checked it twice
It just didn’t sound right like the Soulja Chris Brown fight
#StillMovin with the pound sign
It’s me Young D smoking weed with your valentines
But Demrick is the official name
Dodging all these roadblocks
Cuffin’ niggas switching lanes
And I know there’s so much more to explain
Everything comes in time
Just don’t get fucked along the way

[Verse 3: Reezy]
Uh, came up in the game like the six man
Bag on me, bitch yellow like the Simpsons
Her last nigga had a shot, but he bricked it
Said she need a rebound, call me Tristan
Level up the flow since we in a suite
Mouth full o’ gold like I'm from Tenniken
Team good, everybody up for M.V.P
Dis year we handing out L’s like the D.O.V
Only time we holding L’s up is with the V
They like them boys from the vevo coming with the heat
Counting up the paper comin’ through the sheets
Marathon hustle runnin’ through the streets
Since a fetus I knew they couldn’t defeat us
Fuck a day job we trapping at night to feed us
Food on the table providing cuz I was able
[?] be the code and Still Movin the label

[Verse 4: Euroz]
Vegas boy on that shit that you’re not
Repping well so the homes behind it like Sherlock
You can ask Def Boy got it for sure locked
We inquired if It Was Written by y’all and heard Nas
Headed to the top that's for certain
On my early Doc Dre, tryna get that first sim
Devil on my soul on my line like its urgent
OG burning heavy lifting like burdens
Got deals sittin' just waiting on the cursive
Voodoo doll effect dog, the shit I pin gon hurt ‘em
Don't act like they MC the lord know they been lurkin'
Getting underground scratched, just itching to scratch the surface
Rich in spirit not to mention what we earnin'
When the smoke clears y’all in ashes bring the earns in
From the safe place, the difference we put the work in
Had to [?] niggas is serpents
Hating online but watch your line when it’s in person
Flick for the gram and caption, niggas is working
We really the way y’all boys just in the way though
A lot of people turn that’s cool, sorted the tables
Now all we do is win like the refs is on payroll
Everybody eats and we blessed like all say so
Started, show up they like “ah shit”
Cuz they number two to the one and now they all pissed
Center floor hard like it ain’t got a carpet
Just me and my dogs coming through leavin’ paw prints
Waves on waves on the way I know they nauseas
Years past niggas still hating, typa nonsense
But I respond when it’s blatant shit
Still losing ain’t a shot but I don’t aim and miss
It’s either costumes and contacts to me it’s undercover but a prodigy, I ain’t convinced
And in any of these suits pockets playin handkerchief
Let em sleep don’t catch up boy we don’t wait for shit
Nah, we don’t wait for shit
Run the game and take some bread but not away from shit
