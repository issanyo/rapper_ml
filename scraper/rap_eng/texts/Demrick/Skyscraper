[Chorus]
I'm building up my money, call it skyscraper paper
I got models, I got strippers, I got bitches I'm a player
I'm in that residential, waving hi to my neighbors
Then I'm on that next flight saying bye to my neighbors
I'm building up my money, call it skyscraper paper
I got models, I got strippers, I got bitches I'm a player
I'm in that residential, waving hi to my neighbors
Then I'm on that next flight saying bye to my neighbors

[Verse 1: Demrick]
I made it outta my hood
I know some niggas wish I was back there
That's why old friends is just old friends
I'm in Chuck Taylors with a low brim
Got my old Tims and my North Face
From the old days in that cold place
Now it's rose and good kush
California living on my sole face
I got no shame, from the nose bleeds to the center stages at long way
How I got here? Niggas want to act like it's not fair
Just 'cause I know millionaires who know billionaires
'Cause i'm a thousandaire who tryna get there
I used food stamps to fill the frigidaire
Now it's weekend trips up to big bear
I got a swimming pool in my backyard
Couple pitbulls in my backyard
Couple bitches in bikinis, barbecues what the fuck were you doing? You finally get a backyard
Been in Australia, New Zealand, all of Europe in the last month
I could use this fuel that's in that blunt
Smoke it to the head don't pass once
And I know my neighbors upset, 'cause we ain't been to sleep yet
We playing these beats on repeat for a week and i'm just warming up as a heat jack
And we don't get a reset, so I'm doing this shit without a regret
She say she wanna stay and get her feet wet
But I'm diving in to the deep end, better reach in

[Chorus]
I'm building up my money, call it skyscraper paper
I got models, I got strippers, I got bitches I'm a player
I'm in that residential, waving hi to my neighbors
Then I'm on that next flight saying bye to my neighbors
I'm building up my money, call it skyscraper paper
I got models, I got strippers, I got bitches I'm a player
I'm in that residential, waving hi to my neighbors
Then I'm on that next flight saying bye to my neighbors

[Verse 2: Logic]
Recognize real when I write this
Never do it like this, RattPack be the hypest
Goddamn can you feel it, hold up motherfucker let me kill it run it back like that
Got your back like chiroprac- hit you with the gat like brrra
Nah, never that, goddamn, now they wonder who the man
I'ma sell a hundred thousand, first week by the man
V's up be the band, L-O-G-I-C that be the brand
From Maryland to the west fuck all the rest we connected
Took a while but we respected, now they know yeah

[Verse 3: King Chip]
I'm just looking for a reason to cut some people off
Zero tolerance, no hollering just piss'em off
This ain't no new year's resolution, nigga this all year
I'm tryna keep my circle tight 'cause nigga this our year
I'm extra cold flying through the no fly zone
44108 yeah that's that you can die zone
King Chip the coldest that you ever lay eyes on
It's a blessing for you haters to share my time zone

[Outro]
Building up my money, call it skyscraper paper
