[Verse 1]
I know it’s hard to let go of control
Got so much you can’t show on your soul
Paid my way, no tolls in a roll
Ten toes stayed down on the floor that’s for sure
That’s the motto we live by
Searching for the answers in the bottle but no question we get high
Means to escape
My mind sometimes seems to be in outer space, but the world is my fate
I’m a stoner, I’m a dreamer
Still believe in love
Doing drugs, I’m a cheater
Said if I knew better I’d do better than I ever did
Then I knew better
Still made the same mistakes again
How ironic
All I need is some chronic and some gin
It’s a rollercoaster ride and I’m on it ‘till the end
Rather tell the truth while others I stead
And I say this every night right before I go to bed


[Hook]
Ashes, ashes
Dust to dust
Sometimes we’ve all just had enough
Take another hit then pass the blunt
We’re just out here having fun

We all got stresses, we all got pain
We all got pressure on our brain
Pops on the block selling crack cocaine
Did it on the spot like Kurt Cobain


[Verse 2]
I’d rather chase dreams
Reality seems, filled with more characters than movies on a screen
It’s all scripted
Search for something authentic
Might just take shrooms, go and pay the moon a visit
No radio, they don’t want the world to listen
Revolutionary vision. Blunt twisted
Liquor sipping contradiction
My decision
Live this way ‘till the grave call my name
Thin line between being genius and insane
That’s the game that I want to play either way
I’m a lover, I’m a fighter
Gangster, I’m a writer
Derides fours niggas like rims on the tires
Want the best for the worst
Get fed a curse
‘Cause you can get a gift and I shit if you don’t work
My Timbs in the dirt, not a dollar in her purse
Long way ‘till the first


[Hook]
Ashes, ashes
Dust to dust
Sometimes we’ve all just had enough
Take another hit then pass the blunt
We’re just out here having fun

We all got stresses, we all got pain
We all got pressure on our brain
Pops on the block selling crack cocaine
Did it on the spot like Kurt Cobain
