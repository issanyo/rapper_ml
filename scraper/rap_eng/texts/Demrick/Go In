[Verse 1]
I just landed in Vegas
From the home of the Lakers
Crap tables trying to break us
These hoes keep trying to take us
This life is so contagious
She want a nigga with some acres
A house and a car, a tab at the bar
A star stepping off these stages
We live that life and I did that right
Tell the haters, better not bite
We high like a red-eye flight
She wanna get it on the very first night
And I told her we good to go
I come from the hood, you know
I'mma break it down
Turn that ass 'round
Girl you shoulda known...

[Bridge]
Bad than a motherfucker
Damn...
Damn...
Damn...
Said girl I wanna take you home tonight...
Damn...

[Hook]
I love the way that booty go down
Girl, what you doing, girl what you doing
I love the way you work it out
Girl, what you doing, do it now
She 'bout to go in
Go in, go in, go in
And it's on, she 'bout to go in
I love the way you put it down

[Verse 2]
It's six o'clock in the morning
She on it, I know she want it
Liquor in the cup, feelin' fucked up
Room keep spinning, gotta hold the walls up
I'mma knock it out like a heavyweight fight
T.K.O., call me Teddy for the night
She ready for the night, Teddy fit it right
Body looking good, make me wanna take a bite
And you know I will cause you like that
And I know get these J's rolled before I night cap
I see you, freak in the sheets, like I beast on beats
Boat catcher flow and the headboards screech
Stripes on my chest like a triple OG
Access to the place cause you keep it low-key
