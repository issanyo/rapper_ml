Bout Us

[Verse 1]
Yeah they be plotting. Plotting and wishing
They see and then watch, then they start watching and listening
Trying to block on how I got a position
So much hate, you niggas start a petition
Puffing on pot like I got a prescription
I make them tops disappear like a fucking magician
Niggas acting like bitches, bitches be acting like niggas
Liquor flowing like rivers, shit is destroying my liver
Signed, sealed and delivered until the day I’m considered one of the greatest in the game
Yeah these lames is bitter
Only fuck with my hitters, niggas you never was with us
You ain’t cut from the cloth, you ain’t come from the litter
Only down-ass bitches is the ones that’s with us
All of these groupie-ass hoes, they can’t fuck with a winner
And I’m seeing all these niggas trying to come from the winner
But all these hoes get from me is dick in her dinner

[Hook]
All I fear is God
I ain’t worried ‘bout shit else
No help
Every day I’m out here chasing wealth
And I don’t do this shit for self
It’s ‘bout us
Me and my team, my nigga, yeah us
We living our dreams, my nigga, wassup?
See baby in them jeans, I’m like, wassup!
We don’t give a fuck, no
[Verse 2]
I’m back in the kitchen, shit, I be cookin’ it up
Always been eating, but there’s never enough
This kush been in my blunt. This Henny been in my cup
Niggas ripped in the club while you been in the front
Got bitches bending it over, just know I barely be sober
She think she Vanity Fair. Here goes a fear for the morning
You know how it goes, hoes twitter report
Just keep your eye on the prize
Never get it distorted
I don’t fuck with the novice
All my niggas is solid
You could call my crew a mafia like Christopher Wallace
Stop watching my wallet ‘cause I’ma get it regardless
Never made it to college but baby giving me knowledge
Only thing that I’m learning is always keep this shit burning
I’ma always be earning no matter what you concerned with
This that shit that make you nervous when you step into churches
While you’re searching for your purpose we’ll be out here working

[Hook]
All I fear is God
I ain’t worried ‘bout shit else
No help
Every day I’m out here chasing wealth
And I don’t do this shit for self
It’s ‘bout us
Me and my team, my nigga, yeah us
We living our dreams, my nigga, wassup?
See baby in them jeans, I’m like, wassup!
We don’t give a fuck, no


Cause N Effect

[Verse 1]
Let’s talk about the logic, cause and effect
Hallways in them project steps
Tattoos for the crews I rep
Hundred percent, it’s all I’m betting
In depth with some hoes on deck
In a million different ways to get my hands on a cheque
Talk, the only way to get it is demand and respect
Bills coming in just to add to the stress
So I’m smoking like a California, so fine
Floating on a cloud, nigga, number nine
Drinking and I’m swerving through the jungle line
Some plotted suicide, I used to wonder why
Other sides gets dark, I embrace what it bring
Feeling like a fighter emcee, pays in the ring
Some may say I’m the uncrowned king
Took a million of them down but no one’s counting

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Yeah, I’m feeling it now
Lifted up but I’m still on the ground
Smoking loud, sticking out in the crowd
Always grinding, ain’t no lounging around
Some niggas going nowhere fast
Work hard when I’m down to my last
Guess it’s back to the pounds in the stash
Only way I’m selling out is an ounce in the bag
In the lab cooking up like a chemist
All truth from the past to the present
Give not, the cops will get lost in the message
The one time niggas need a reference
Did it from the ground up [?]
Sneak peek, you gon’ see it in a minute
Money marathon and we all want to win it
But I’m ‘bout to run the game when it’s all said and finished
