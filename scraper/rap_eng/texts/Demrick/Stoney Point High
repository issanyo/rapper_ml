[Verse 1]
This Cali living turn my Timbs to some Chucks
Send my ‘cross the world getting head on the bus
Keep a pretty woman on the end of my blunt
Ducking, dodging cops, can’t keep my hands in them cuffs
Hit the beach, put my feet up in the sand
Drink a fifth, make a plan, roll a gram and expand
Like damn. 90 degrees in December
With an actress and she taking more bumps then a ‘fender
Package it to Denver, with no returned descender
Two dab hits of Jet Fuel mixed together
Got my head in a blender, only Cali can appreciate
The Golden state, but a value you don’t depreciate
Take a hit, pass off to reciprocate
Hot box, ventilate. In and out, dinner plate
Many try to imitate, they found a greater jet
But I’m taking all bets out here on the west

[Hook]
Where the palm trees hit the ghetto, that’s Cali living
(Scratches) Cali living
Where the pretty girls love to roll weed, that’s Cali living
(Scratches) Cali living
When you drink a whole fifth of Hennessey, that’s Cali living
(Scratches) Cali living
And when you’re Stoney Point high like me, that’s Cali living
Nah

[Verse 2]
This Cali lifestyle. Young, wild and high style
Smoking on that knockout, watching when the cops out
Keeping one in rotation on the daily
Mind hazy, high eighties, I’m a barbeque
Maybe, I’m just living for the moment
Make sense, don’t it?
Nigga finally paying bills, all flowing
Wake and baking every single morning, ‘cause breakfast is important
An ass that’s in Spandex and Jordan’s
Damn it’s hard to find a down chick
One you could hang around with
Take her to the room, dick her down quick
Smoking up by the ounce as a [?]
Let’s get this money like accountants
We out kick
This Cali mentality gonna get paid
First they hate you then they love you but they throw shade
That’s everyday around my waist so I don’t trip
Just light it up, take a hit
That’s how we live

[Hook]
Where the palm trees hit the ghetto, that’s Cali living
(Scratches) Cali living
Where the pretty girls love to roll weed, that’s Cali living
(Scratches) Cali living
When you drink a whole fifth of Hennessey, that’s Cali living
(Scratches) Cali living
And when you’re Stoney Point high like me, that’s Cali living
Nah
