[Verse 1]
Yeah life's a trip
Enjoy the ride and the
Highs that you get
Shit
I thought I'd be rich by 20
With pockets full of money
And it's funny when I think about it now
But what's messed up
Is most that end up going in, never come out
And that's just the way the game goes
You heard it before, you know the same oh
But I won't let it get to me
Blaze one up in the sky, yesterdays history
I focus on my next move cause it's gonna be the one
That's gon' take me exactly where I need to be

[Hook x2]
This world is such a blur
I'm holding on to what I know
Just me and my girl
Far cry (far cry)
From where I thought I would be
I guess I'm searching for
All the wrong things (Yeah, Yeah)

[Verse 2]
Don't get lost in the moment...
I go hard for everything I wanted
It's never been a gimmick
Cause shit can get real in a New York minute
That's why I blaze to stay calm
Flows propane, they nick-named me napalm
And shots to mc's like Raekwon
That been dropping hits in this game for way long
And that's how i'm gonna be
Ten years deep in the game
Homie you'll see
Young De
But young is just a mind state
And I stay high about as high as the crime rate

[Hook x2]
This world is such a blur
I'm holding on to what I know
Just me and my girl
Far cry (far cry)
From where I thought I would be
I guess I'm searching for
All the wrong things (Yeah, Yeah)

[Verse 3]
Now tell me what you're looking for
You want a lifestyle that you can't afford
Hustle hustle baby
Go out there and make more
Charge it to the game
Don't worry how you pay for it
Cause tomorrow's not promised
So stop being so cautious
I put all my cards on the table so
Let's see how it turns out. Here we go
But as long as I have another day
It don't matter to me either way
And fuck what the haters say
'Cause if it ain't you
Then it's gonna be another thing

[Hook x2]
This world is such a blur
I'm holding on to what I know
Just me and my girl
Far cry (far cry)
From where I thought I would be
I guess I'm searching for
All the wrong things (Yeah, Yeah)
