{Connecting the call}

Man I've got some shit on my fucking chest
Welcome to my out
The out
Been going through a lot


[Verse 1]

At eleven years age I met my paps in the cage
He said I'm gonna end up there with him one day
So sorry for being distant, I just think a little different
Had to step back, re-calibrate my vision
That's for my family that I never met that's listening
I since I never met you, guess I don't no what I'm missing
But I live with my decisions, I'ma take 'em to the grave with me
I just that you pray for me, please believe faith for me
Cosigned by legends, how I'm not on deck?
Beyond stress, but I know now, my time next to go bet
Long time in the making, you can't take it away
Good lord, don't let me die, so try and make me a name
It's only me that held myself back, I can't stop that
Knowing times the only thing that you can't get back
I'll be skeptic while I spit it, I'ma do this independent
I can feel it building by the minute, and it's authentic
Nigga uhh
I feels so good to me. Just like it's supposed to be
Competition so relaxed we tell 'em lie back
I'm in a plane, drinking whiskey, that's a high jack
Niggas half as old as me, they say they as old as me
Might blow an oz and fuck a bitch in Jodeci
There's a whole different poesy in my poetry
See most of these niggas get cold feet trying to flow with me
Born in Spokane, raised in North Philly
But L.A. really made me this way. I hope you feel me
Drinking henny daily, baby and I pray it don't kill me
High box in hotel room, fucking bill me (fucking bill me)

But you better got proof
Hahaha

[Outro]
Different day, same shit right?
Different day, same shit
Something I had to get off my chest, but um
Demrick! (Demrick)
And we live (and we live)
