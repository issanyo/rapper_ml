[Hook: Demrick]
16 ounces in a pound, break it down, break it down
24 hours goes around and around
Inside the ride everybody get loud
Sitting up on a cloud looking down at the crowd
Wanna know what's going on with kids these days
We just smoke, we just drink, we just get paid
We don't give a fuck what anybody say
We just smoke, we just drink, we just get paid

[Verse 1: Demrick]
I'm not to be fucked with I hustled out of my bucket
I keep my dreams in my clutches I roll my weed up with crutches
You ain't talking about money then it's not my discussion
Down this road to success on my path to destruction
Game didn't come with instructions, I travel light with no luggage
Not the type to hold grudges I want a life with no budget
Wanna pull up in something new, right on the avenue
Where I spent every afternoon, serving them after schools
Say get your degree, but that wasn't for me
They was talking about a future that I just couldn't see
Hotboxing my ride, I'm leaving no room to breathe
Just try and catch me a vibe, staying away from police
Wanna pull out the crib, put my name on the lease
Trying to get me a meal right in the belly of the beast
What I've learned in these streets is what I write on these sheets
So what you know about me is everything that I see

16 ounces in a pound, break it down, break it down

We just smoke, we just drink, we just get paid
We don't give a fuck what anybody say
We just smoke, we just drink, we just get paid

[Verse 2: Demrick]
If we ain't fighting we fucking, if we ain't fucking we fighting
Instead of keeping it cool we choose to keep it exciting
Others trying to convince, a nigga not making sense
Wanna push [?] but that don't move me an inch
Had me lasso the bench when I go hard as the starters
Never be like my father I plan on taking this farther
Say this game will make you crazy, shit it's probably true
But I ain't following you, no one belongs to these shoes
A head hard as gristle ass is soft as a pillow
She go off like a pistol I love a bitch with some issues
What's keeping it simple, some kush in my mental
A dope instrumental or being caught in the middle
The other people's bullshit, I'm not trying to hear it
Why you judging my lyrics, trying to fuck with my spirit
Load a bong and clear it cause I'm not even worried
I'ma get mine in time, shit I'm not in a hurry
