[Chorus: Price]
The sun walks on water everytime it rises
You can count on that
What make the money but will never let it divide us
You can count on that
The hood gon' have my back, you can count on that
The love gon' stay attached, you can count on that
Put that on somethin', I put that on wrap

[Verse 1: Price]
Uh yeah, look up mama, I'm pretty far from the palm trees
I knew I'd make it here back when you used to clean the whole house to John B
And I get goosebumps from head to feet, it was all for a scene like a palm read
I wish when people say they promise, it was concrete
I miss my cousin, call it and chop it like Ron C
Speakin' of Ron C, shoutout to Texas
GVT still movin' the message, respect the collective, yeah
She on the passenger side rollin' up gas for me
Too many snakes, hope the creator watch the grass for me
I'm over their shoulder watchin' them count it accurately
You'll never hear someone say that they wrote my raps for me
You'll never hear 'em say Price gon' snitched or run
Or I bit my tongue, I ditched my squad or I ain't get the funds
I walk on water like Christ, the melainated type
We really givin' y'all life, tell 'em to save the hype

[Chorus: Price]
The sun walks on water everytime it rises
You can count on that
What make the money but will never let it divide us
You can count on that
The hood gon' have my back, you can count on that
The love gon' stay attached, you can count on that
Put that on somethin', I put that on rap

[Verse 2: Oktane]
Yeah look, now as I combine all the juice from the mind
If I pull up, it come back all the time
And I know it's no turnin' back from the sign
So I keep my eyes up and I wise up, rise up
Feelin' like I was the one, never given none
Still hungry like we never had some
I make a hundred raps and stay up past 1
And back up at it at 5, just happy to be alive
Travelin' everywhere, gettin' it done, second to none
Weapons are drawn everyday in cities for fun
This is for them, they gotta hustle to some
And know that everyday they do it, they don't hustle for nothin'
Stackin' for a rainy day, because them days do come
You stand there when it rains because they all do run
They all point at your sins but we all do some
Just make sure they never catch you frontin'
'Cause we know that

[Chorus: Price]
The sun walks on water everytime it rises
You can count on that
What make the money but will never let it divide us
You can count on that
The hood gon' have my back, you can count on that
The love gon' stay attached, you can count on that
Put that on somethin', I put that on rap

[Verse 3: Demrick]
Nowadays they gonna throw shade on your name
All about a dollar, keep the change, keep the change
Love drunk from a taste of the fame
But not me, I'ma stay the same, stay the same
My style flexin' like that older pile of frame
But I'm switchin' lanes in a matte black Range
Tour life, drinkin' more water for more life
Forward thinkin', you don't need glasses for foresight
But baby I need my bread like them honey rolles
Keep these hoes on they toes like bands with the gummy soles
Cookie cones, smooth sailin' through these bumpy roads
In life, I'm shinin' solid gold, call me 24
Live by the code, tomorrow ain't promised to us
Only thing they want runnin' through us is embalmin' fluid
Let the music move me, hit the booth, make a movie
Stories written for the people by yours truly

[Verse 4: Dizzy Wright]
I seen niggas come under me and blow up and I'm still jealous
So this year I'm stayin' prepared like meal preppin'
Real method, I feel like a giant that don't exist
That's why I'm only writin' classics, so they classify shit
We gotta maximize until they advertise this
And I'm like King James, get an axe from basketball tips
I got faith in me so that must mean I'm victorious
I'm paintin' pictures of the media and the law
Probably over your head, I resume to me and my dogs
The sun rise, I fall from the sky and break the fall
Convinced sunlight was the birth of my dark skin
All this melanin, they at war with theyselves like Vietnam
I still don't understand brother man
I know you wasn't dealt an upper hand, but chill you gotta relax
Peace to the land, all the people doin' what they can
If you need a friend in Dizzy Wright, you know right where I'm at
'Cause

[Chorus: Price]
The sun walks on water everytime it rises
You can count on that
What make the money but will never let it divide us
You can count on that
The hood gon' have my back, you can count on that
The love gon' stay attached, you can count on that
Put that on somethin', I put that on rap
