[Hook: Dizzy Wright]
She only want me cause I put up with her bullshit
(Why do you do that, man?)
Don't make this cool nigga hit a full switch
(Don't test your luck baby girl)
She hella loud and she always being animated
(Better calm your ass down)
Got me smoking on the loud now I'm aggravated
(She don't know she got it good)

[Verse 1: Dizzy Wright]
Yo, getting paid in the envelope
She impressed with how much I making, until I start telling her NOPE (Oh, you don't like that, huh?)
Everyday awake I hustle like I'm broke
I got numbers blocked in my phone, cause these bitches been doing the most (Damn, calm down)
Yo, stalking my posts, bitch, you ain't SLIIICK
Yeah, I'm a dog, but you ain't SHIIIT
You shaking that ass for all them tips
I ain't the only one that's getting licks
Yo, this pimping shit exists, I done seen it with my own eyes
Got to keep that Dizzy OG on you for the long ride
(Real players knock the baddest bitches)
I bet you won't try
(Yeah I'm just up for the tags)
You love me cause the song fire (yeah)
I be doing shit, man, I be doing shit (woah)
Late night, working man, I done turned into a lunatic (right)
She be flexing on the boy when I be pulling in
Knowing what she could've been

[Verse 2: Demrick]
Oh she got it good, baby got it great
But if I got to get some money then she got to wait
She said don't let her be the one I had that got away
But anything can be replaced, baby, God is great
And how did kicking it on occasion turn to obligation?
I ain't Captain Save 'Em
Stop trying working me like an occupation
Get some dick, some good weed, and some conversation
Let's not complicate it

[Verse 3: Dizzy Wright]
All I need is time, and a Hennessy drink (right)
Yeah I'm all about it, you can try and reach your limits with me (right)
Lil' sexy thang, I told her to send the image to me
She took a pic with all that ass on the sink (GOD DAMN)
One of a kind, I was kicking it on the scene with her
Two at a time, she was trying to get me to leave with her
But I'd rather be at home bumping bass with us, the weed keeps us together, I can't make it up
