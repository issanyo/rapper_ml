[Chorus: Demrick]

Ive been dreaming so long, shit became real
Livin' life so fast, burn a tire off the wheel
You got so much to say right now, but its fuck how you feel
Cuz I've been doing me so long, you already know the deal
Imma young'n steady gleamin
Young'n steady gleamin (3x)
Steady gleamin
Young'n steady gleamin (3x)
Yea, Yea


[Verse 1: Demrick]

Im too ready, my crew deadly
My kush heavy, My new chevy, got rims on it
Got ten on it, for this rap game ive been wantin'
Ive been called that im next level
Keep an eye out for that bullshit
Choose wisely who you move with
Im Ron Isley on the smooth shit
Hit the 'woof and I lose it
Black out, act out, studio my crackhouse
Serve em up 'til I max out fuck a bitch throw her back out
She wanna be where the ballers at
Shit so old like artifacts
Thats why i don't never call her back
She know all that where the clubs at where the drugs at
Where the fucks at, where the loves at
Who the tight end who the quarterback
I touchdown, you run it back
See the scoreboard? Im on tour, got more whores on all fours
Than you niggas throwin out a hundred racks


[Chorus]


[Verse 2: Demrick]

You know its real, I overkill
I overshine, this is overdrive
And over time, theyll all see
If i my heart beatin, we all eatin
All season we all stars
Them chuck taylors nigga fuck failure
Theyll try to tell you lifes too hard
But big buds in my kush jar
Keep me relaxed so i dont trip
Roll with those and know to go get
Pocket filled with empty promises
Cuz you tricked it all on my old bitch
If you dont got nothing you dont get nothing
Ive been you something you been frontin
You lust at bitches ive been fuckin'
No chain but ive been stuntin
We out'chea allowed where you get no waxes
Game time this is no practice
Like a new pussy on a old mattress
My flow classic I can't stop I won't quit
Feel like puffy way back in '96
Pullin' up in something gorgeous
Next stop is that Forbes' list


[Chorus: Demrick]
