[Verse 1]
So let me know what you waiting on
Oh you waiting on, what these other niggas hating on
Every song I make filled with pain, you can sing alone
Life’s a long trip so just watch who you bring along with ya
Now let me paint a picture of a block where Glocks get dumped out like swishers
Bricks get flipped like switches
Where mothers don’t kiss you
And homies pouring liquor ‘cause they miss you
And niggas climbing fences, they try and dodge offences
Stash by the benches
The grind is relentless
And most die by 25, so working a nine to five for a pension
Sounds senseless
Mary Jane take my pain away
Can we set a date, to sedate?
And fade away
‘Cause it’s hard to make it through day-to-day
When cops bangin’ down your door like 808’s
The little food I do scrape off my plate
Don’t leave you full, still feel like you ain’t ate
Better get yours my nigga, you ain’t eight
I’m grown with a hood mind state I can’t break
I’m addicted to bitches that ass shake
And getting these hundreds I can’t save
Bad days go away with bottles of champagne
This is the life that we can’t change

[Hook]
Get into this mentality, alternate reality, a different mind state
Get into this mentality, alternate reality, a different mind state
Get into this mentality, alternate reality, a different mind state
Get into this mentality, alternate reality, a different mind state
