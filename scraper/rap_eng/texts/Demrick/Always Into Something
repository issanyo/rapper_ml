[Hook]
Dabbing out, waxing. Rolling up, puffing
Living like that, yeah, we always into something
Pouring up, sipping. Talking shit, tripping
That’s the life we living. We always into something

I came from nothing, best believe we get it jumping
Me and my niggas get it poppin’ at the function
From up top all the way down to the dungeon
That’s the life we living. We always into something

[Verse 1]
From out of the ghetto with rows of rolls
Yeah I suppose, show the code. I can’t console my soul
Death to Jefferson, known Philadelph resident
Transplant to L.A. with a gang called [?], Flow effortless
My name Demerick. I do it for the books
Do it for the crooks. Do it for these bitches shootin’ looks
Do it for the stoners always steaming like a sauna
Smoking while we rollin’ just to keep rotation going
Fuck your opinions, I’m through pretending to be offended
You ain’t witness up in this authentic in a minute
To ease the tension I get paid to pay attention
You fuck off, we 86 of my niggas ain’t babysitting
This real life. Ain’t no resets and cheat codes
Inhale the weed smoke. Release the beast mode
I got plans to advance in this game
You spend your last on some ass, I’ll just pass, I’m ok
I’ll be

Dabbing out, waxing. Rolling up, puffing
Living like that, yeah, we always into something

I came from nothing, best believe we get it jumping
Me and my niggas get it poppin’ at the function
From up top all the way down to the dungeon
That’s the life we living. We always into something

[Verse 2]
Fit the Henny, fit the Remy, I drink many
Went from scratching up pennies for Wendy’s to riding a Benz-ie
Had my pockets so nifty, but my dreams all full
This a wild lifestyle, nigga, we go through
Take aim like a pool game. Shake it up like loose change
Barely getting high, you probably only smoked a few strains
While my niggas go insane with it
Light up a flame and hit it. Take a medicated minute
Higher than flight attendants
Sky rise, surprise. Ain’t defined by my limits
Third eye blind
Baby I’m wide awoke, but I need a rider though
Right by my side, you know for my boys you antidote
And I quote
If I die today, may God bless me
Make sure my family’s straight, just know this world’s testy
But ‘till then I’m living life to the fullest
Fuck the bullshit, keep it moving
You already know I do this
I be
