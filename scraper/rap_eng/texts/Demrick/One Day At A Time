[Intro]
It's a new year, new energy
We over here in Broken Complex studios
And we still movin'
Stoney Point 2 shit
Check it out

[Hook]
What's meant to be will definitely be mine
If I take it one day at a time (day at a time)
I stopped listening to the doubts in my mind
I realized that's the devil in disguise (devil in disguise)
I never thought I'd make it past 25
I survived, man, thank God I'm alive
I take a hit, close my eyes
Visualize where I'm headed
Take it one day at a time
Take it one day at a time
I take it one day at a time
I take it one day at a time
I take it one day at a time

[Verse]
Up early, thankful for another day
Roll up a jane, I'm in the studio and definitely making plays
'cause these bills won't pay themself
My partner told me homie play your stealth
Play the game, but never play yourself
I just play the cards I'm dealt
I could tell you 'bout the life a struggling artist felt
From broken glass on the stages in the Bible Belt
To first class flights over night, I did this by myself
And money been the mission since the bare beginning
I don't mean to offend you
I grew up with nothing and I'm not gon' pretend to
Act like I didn't want to have more than a little
[? 1:33] stuck in the middle
And I spent them long drives staring out of the window
To kill time I asked moms would she play instrumentals
That's the moment that I actually fell in love with this rap shit
Since that day I pray one day I'd make me a classic

[Hook]
What's meant to be will definitely be mine
If I take it one day at a time (day at a time)
I stopped listening to the doubts in my mind
I realized that's the devil in disguise (devil in disguise)
I never thought I'd make it past 25
I survived, man, thank God I'm alive
I take a hit, close my eyes
Visualize where I'm headed
Take it one day at a time
Take it one day at a time
I take it one day at a time
I take it one day at a time
I take it one day at a time

[Verse 2]
I planned for tomorrow, but live in the moment
When it's over I hope that I'm noted as truly devoted
Inhaling exotics elevated my conscious
I used to pray to them rap gods that my flow would be flawless
Nowadays it's fuck what you accomplish and let's be honest
I'm the biggest name that came out [? 2:43] as artist
Then I moved to Philly where rappers are regarded as the hardest
Since where I sharpen my blade, I call those days my college
I took my knowledge out the LA
Land an opportunity where everything was new to me
And spent the last of my hustle cash out fast and foolishly
But for real, I would never take them days back for shit
And just know if you got a up on me, boy the payback's a bitch
And after the puff faking and all those lame ass [? 3:05]
I changed my name to Demrick, gave it to you how it is
And if you rockin' with me just know I appreciate you
And if you hatin' that's why you're not at my dinner table

[Hook]
What's meant to be will definitely be mine
If I take it one day at a time (day at a time)
I stopped listening to the doubts in my mind
I realized that's the devil in disguise (devil in disguise)
I never thought I'd make it past 25
I survived, man, thank God I'm alive
I take a hit, close my eyes
Visualize where I'm headed
Take it one day at a time
Take it one day at a time
I take it one day at a time
I take it one day at a time
I take it one day at a time
