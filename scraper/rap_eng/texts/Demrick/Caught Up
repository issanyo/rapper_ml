[Verse 1: Demrick]
Lately I've been looking at the news, so confused
I got a view in this world, you do what you gotta do
What's the proof?
Just know I'm ridin' out for me and mines
Read between the lines, all the they ever feed is lies
Cause all I see is dollar signs over peoples' lives
You think police give a fuck if your momma cry?
I guess I'm traumatized, all this false I idolize makes a idol mind, but I don't mind
It's the where the nigga raised, blunts that I blaze, yeah they doing shade but I'm out here getting paid
But that shit won't last forever doe, guess you never know, we put our homies locked in federal on pedestals
I was [?] to keep this shit fresh from head to toe
Put my name on a chain just to let them know
Who I am, had a plan from the jump
I'm a man that understands he can have what he wants

[Verse 2: Gavlyn]
I'm tryin' find some inspiration some motivation
I'm tired [?] is basic in here
I think I'm a higher level
I know my words well enough to ever shake or tremble
Though this shit is scary, cause it's my livelihood
I got to take these chances, cause it's my livelihood
Livin' life dangerously cause I need too
My passion got me chasin' these dreams that I sleep through
Does it all makes sense, guess we'll find out
We all on the same gold mind do whats that about
Yeah we really out here in a real way
Thick-skinned, caught up, that's my forte
I got a big heart, bet I got a lot of love, and I lost a lot of homies with that cold shoulder shrug
Their [?], ego, and jealously, that's a cold piece can't be happy
Sincerely, they so icy
