[Verse 1: B-Real]
So many lights, ninety nights in my grow room
So many heights, taking flights while we hit the bloom
Started up a couple plants blowing up the block
Best in the west couldn't keep my shit in stock
Everytime I harvest buying off a cop
Buying off a block, Greenthumb rising to the top
They ask who got the product
Just tell them Green done brought it
They understand quality over profit
I'm the top of the topic
They got the fuel if you want it
Take you to Paris or Florence
And I can shatter your nugget
And if you fuck with me, fuck it
We can thuggin' and take it
Any level invaders so all you bitches can say

[Hook: Demrick]-[X2]
I'll pass it to the left, put it in rotation
Never lose a step
All this paper that I'm chasing
All I see is green
And I'mma keep it blazing
Smoke you out with these kush coversations

[Verse 2: B-Real]
Pass it to the left, that's the realest hit
But when you roll it put on a funky feel tip
That's how we smokers do
You know we smoke a few
You silly bitches man you know this ain't promotional
Don't get emotional
I'm coasting so you learn the biz
Shout out to my partners
Snoop, Berner, Courtesy and Wiz
Man I see you Dizzy, you'll get the cover soon
Red and Meth come on, put me in How High 2
My family smokes the best
Represents from east to west
You know we roll the kush
Inhale and let it fill your chest
Blowing out your lungs, save for the flavor rookie
Let's call the cookie monster
Roll it up with [?]'s pussy
Let's have a conversation blazing up the medication
Sorry if I'm spacing it's a former meditation
It's called the high life
Breath and get your mind right
You see me shine bright, metal fuckin' highlight

[Hook]
