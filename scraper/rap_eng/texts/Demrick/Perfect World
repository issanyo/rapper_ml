[Verse 1]
Comin' in with my new girl so it's out the door with my old hoes
Killed the game with my own shit, can't wait 'til they hear my new flows
I like Rose Gold, plain tees with my logo
It's so vain, yeah I know, but now she know my name at the go-go
Smoking good cheeba at the cantina, when I need that break
Drinking [?] shots, you can keep that lime, I shoot mine straight
Money marathon, yeah, I'm on that race
She a bad bitch so I'm on that case
Roll through the city, don't need no breaks
And we always say
Aye!

[Hook]
We're smoking and drinking, having some fun
Living life off the wall
This club's almost over, come carry me home
We're living life off the wall

I need a day off so I can go and kick my feet up
With my Señorita
Roll this little tree up in a perfect world
I'm living in a perfect world
Yeah

Got this bad little mama with all the right features
Smoking on this reefer
Damn, I'm glad to meet you in this perfect world
We're living in this perfect world
Yeah

[Verse 2]
I came through, made my own lane
Backed your chick with my old game
Wait 'til she hear my new lines
I got her and her friends at the same time
When I touch down, it's game time
You know I put in that work
What you got under that skirt?
Let me see you make that twerk
Sometimes I just need a day off
A getaway, a mini vacation
With all these problems in the world right now
How could they wonder why I stay blazing
I puff green, I'm kicking back
I take my time to just relax
But I'm turnt up anywhere I turn up
So you know where it's at
Yeah!

[Hook]
We're smoking and drinking, having some fun
Living life off the wall
This club's almost over, come carry me home
We're living life off the wall

I need a day off so I can go and kick my feet up
With my Señorita
Roll this little tree up in a perfect world
I'm living in a perfect world
Yeah

Got this bad little mama with all the right features
Smoking on this reefer
Damn, I'm glad to meet you in this perfect world
We're living in this perfect world
Yeah
