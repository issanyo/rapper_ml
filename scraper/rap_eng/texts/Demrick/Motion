[Intro]
Yeah, that's the way we motion
We still movin'

[Hook]
That's the motion
I be out here on my own shit
My niggas make waves like the ocean
You bitches be in your emotions
We in motion
You still tripping off of that old shit
Me, I be riding and smoking
That's just the way that I motion
That's the motion
I be out here on my own shit
My niggas make waves like the ocean
You bitches be in your emotions
We in motion
You still tripping off of that old shit
Me, I be riding and smoking
That's just the way that I motion

[Verse 1]
We in motion
Boy I'm rollercoasting, rolling smoking
Riding, vibing
Shit make me feel like I'm on an island right by the ocean
Shoot the video and monetize it
I'm doing me now, no apologizing
My block and [?]
Always keeping it fly but with auto pilot
Try hittin' my joint, have an out of body
She rollin' with me then she down to party
You the type to get on and don't know nobody
I'm the type to come through cause I'm always money
Move to Cali where it's always sunny
No seeds in my weed, yeah it's green and fluffy
Won't stop til momma's living comfy and I own a couple [?]
[?] since my early 20's
Been motivated since I owed a payment
So much gave up in this conversation
No love for these hoes, man it's complicated
My [?] novacained it
Fuck this fame shit, it will never change us
Fuck this fame shit, it will never change us
I was made for this game and the things that it came with
Ayy
