[Hook]
Back in the day, growing up so much I couldn’t afford
I wanted more from this crazy world we’re living in
Ran through with my lights out
So don’t you criticize my lifestyle

Back in the day, growing up so much I couldn’t afford
I wanted more from this crazy world we’re living in
Ran through with my lights out
So don’t you criticize my lifestyle

[Verse 1]
Fourteen years old, babysitting when my phone rang
My partner on the other side, he talk about “let’s go man”
We headed out to New York, shit’s a whole different domain
Put our rap shit on the fast track, get up out the slow lane
So we stole a whip from this chick and caught her name, and a cheque book
We should’ve been in classes reading textbooks
But we tired of being patient, sick of waiting for that next look
And my partner just got juvenile life over a left hook
So we riding down the 90 East headed for The Bronx, no turning back now
I’m nervous as fuck, but I can’t back down
Can’t let these older niggas view me like I’m a clown
Plus we all rap so this some shit that I can jot down
Four days later we in the mega of this rap shit
New York lights shining bright, never would’ve imagined what happened next
My partner got bagged for them bad cheques
His PM left our shit out on the step
I’m fucking stressed

[Hook]
Back in the day, growing up so much I couldn’t afford
I wanted more from this crazy world we’re living in
Ran through with my lights out
So don’t you criticize my lifestyle

Back in the day, growing up so much I couldn’t afford
I wanted more from this crazy world we’re living in
Ran through with my lights out
So don’t you criticize my lifestyle

[Verse 2]
I’m at the pay phone calling mom’s collect, I hope she accept
I got myself into this mess, now I’m full of regret
I ain’t even tell her that I left
I know she stressed and upset
And get me this ticket back home but put her further in debt
I’m in the Grand Central Station pacing, waiting for the Greyhound
Mom’s couldn’t by a ticket to Spokane so I’m on my way down
To North Carolina where my aunt and uncle resign
They told me they sicken tired of me being a fucking liar
And how my mom’s a fighter, she raised three kids on her own
And if I think that I’m wrong, they ‘gon do this all alone
So they tore up the plane ticket that my auntie just bought me
This a defining moment birthing all the lessons they taught me
My uncle told me “stop fucking with those knuckleheads. You a good kid but you getting in trouble instead. You should be focusing on your music if you really want to do it. I was a DJ back in my day. You got to prove it
So take this bus ride for 11 days
Peanut butter, jelly, loaf of bread, but not a dollar to your name.”
Shit
I realized actions could inflict pain
Especially to those that love you
You know, the ones that put no one above you
The message is go for what you dream for
It’s risk first, reward
Even teachers once was student before
And you could have anything you reach for
Life’s a stranger ‘til you figure out what you ‘gon meet for
For real

[Hook]
Back in the day, growing up so much I couldn’t afford
I wanted more from this crazy world we’re living in
Ran through with my lights out
So don’t you criticize my lifestyle

Back in the day, growing up so much I couldn’t afford
I wanted more from this crazy world we’re living in
Ran through with my lights out
So don’t you criticize my lifestyle

[Outro]
Man recording this song is a trip
Thinking back to the situation and where I was thinking at the time
I was fucking trippin’
Just out here trying to get it, I don’t even know how or, what I was really doing
I’ve already apologized but I’m sorry for that shit

Look at me now, living my dream
R.I.P. to my uncle Curtis
He always believed it was possible
Showing me that tough love, you know?
Shit you be mad about then, but the man it made me now, I know it’s worth it
