[Chorus: Reezy]
That’s how I get in my zone, that’s how I get in my zone, that’s how I get in my zone
That’s how I get in my zone, that’s how I get in my zone, that’s how I get
Backwoods, stuffed cones, that’s how I get in my zone
That’s how I get in my zone, that’s how I get in my zone
Lane swervin’, alone, that’s how I get in my zone
That’s how I get in my zone, that’s how I get in my zone
Backrumbs on the throne, that’s how I get in my zone
That’s how I get in my zone, that’s how I get in my zone
Money callin’ my phone, that’s how I get in my zone
That’s how I get in my zone, that’s how I get in my zone

[Verse 1: Price]
Kush OG got me zoned out, turned off Waze, took my own route
Speackin’ to our soul, I know they want me to tone down
Cops want to shoot me, pull your phone out (get down)
I’m in my zone, no doubt, when them deposits hit
[?]
When the block is lit, my wife stop to trippin’
I’m in my zone like [?], can’t stop from hittin’, Price

[Verse 2: Dizzy Wright]
I roll my weed straight up and wake ‘em up ‘cause I feel they been sleep too long
Get up, get up, go, got to trim my mind, and never ever let my feelings show
I can’t believe I took apart the pieces, learned some things about myself and everything else is not the secret, I mean it
I need to be better for me (what’s that?), I know who I can never be
Someone who ran out on his fam tell my wife, I'm playin' for keeps
Want to see a better version, it’s closed curtains, stay away if your energy low
Still workin’ on a Plan A in a man cave, while the jams play on low
I got my-

[Verse 3: Reezy]
I’m in my zone (zone), puffin’ me some cones (cones)
With a thick red bone, want a bag? Hit my phone (cash, cash)
Hit the gas (gas), mash out on my own (on my own)
Set the tone (tone), ball like Eddie Jones (swish, swish)
Watch the throne (throne), mine came with a recliner (with a recliner)
Fly no drone (drone), mismatch my designer (my designer)
Took some risks (risks), got it out the ditch (out the ditch)
“Paid In Full”, learned the game from Mitch

[Chorus: Reezy]
That’s how I get in my zone, that’s how I get in my zone, that’s how I get in my zone
That’s how I get in my zone, that’s how I get in my zone, that’s how I get
Backwoods, stuffed cones, that’s how I get in my zone
That’s how I get in my zone, that’s how I get in my zone
Lane swervin’, alone, that’s how I get in my zone
That’s how I get in my zone, that’s how I get in my zone
Backrumbs on the throne, that’s how I get in my zone
That’s how I get in my zone, that’s how I get in my zone
Money callin’ my phone, that’s how I get in my zone
That’s how I get in my zone, that’s how I get in my zone

[Verse 4: Demrick]
I wish I knew a couple things, that I know now
But that wouldn’t change how it go down
From growin' up poor, sleepin’ on floors and pull-outs
To pullin’ out a mortgage on my own house (fo’ real)
Lookin' at old photos of me and my homie growin’ up, like damn it's a ghost town
Too many locked or got shot up, settled down and caught up
For that petty shit, they talkin’ don’t affect me
Lately I've been burnin' down these Backwoods heavy
Gettin' in my zone, now I’m ready to take on the world if they let me
But it all comes with time, if there's one thing that I know
Protect your own that’s in survival mode, I remember when I Reached out and only got the dial tone, you are not alone, get in your zone

[Verse 5: Oktane]
Watch still soul, do you rock? Do you roll?
Are you hot? Are you cold? Are you alive? Do you know?
Got my devise on “Do Not Disturb ”, call twice it, don't ring though
[?] know what I mean though, we focus up durin' freethrows
Quiet down, swish, there’s a lot ridin’ on this
[?] smile and don't miss
My girl want to text about the ‘Gram, she mad that I don't give a damn
Settle down, I'm on my way home, you’re interruptin’ the songs on my phone

[Chorus: Reezy]
That’s how I get in my zone, that’s how I get in my zone, that’s how I get in my zone
That’s how I get in my zone, that’s how I get in my zone, that’s how I get
Backwoods, stuffed cones, that’s how I get in my zone
That’s how I get in my zone, that’s how I get in my zone
Lane swervin’, alone, that’s how I get in my zone
That’s how I get in my zone, that’s how I get in my zone
Backrumbs on the throne, that’s how I get in my zone
That’s how I get in my zone, that’s how I get in my zone
Money callin’ my phone, that’s how I get in my zone
That’s how I get in my zone, that’s how I get in my zone
