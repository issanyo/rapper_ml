[Hook: Xzibit]
Sometimes people, people would get you down
Then get back up, it's not the end of the world
Yeah
Although it may feel like that sometimes
It's so simple, simple, as one, two, three
Back on your feet, you gotta hold your head high
Let 'em know we right here, forever
We ain't going nowhere till the end of the world

[Verse 1: Xzibit]
Ladies and gentleman, introducing the most impressive
I plan on shaking the planet until I'm convalescent
I never count my blessings, I only count the cost of living
It's hard to buy everything they sell on television
My momma cried religion, I only got my dreams
One day they gonna be reality, can't rip off the seam
If I could just achieve, and not just make-believe
But anybody else is gon' create what only I can see

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Young De]
Standing tall, never fall, after all
My pride is all I got, respect is all I want
And I will never crawl, this a race, so I run
Far from where I begun, look at the man that I've become
Look up in the sky, as long as the sun rise
I'll be on this rhyme, while you waiting for the signs
You mistaken, if you think you takin' what's mine
In a world where the blind lead the blind, I'll be fine
Just like the world keep spinning, I'ma keep winning
Either you rollin' with it or you choose to go against it
Your thoughts are so offensive, so I expose intentions
My offence against opposition is so impressive
So here's a message to all of my competition
My words in this composition, reflects the way I'm livin'
Expecting something different when doing the same thing
Is the true definition of insane

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Xzibit]
Let them know we right here forever, we ain't going nowhere till the end of the world
