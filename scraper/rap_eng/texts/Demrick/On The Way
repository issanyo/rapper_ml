[Intro: Dizzy Wright]
Do it til it's perfect
Demrick better have them shots pulled up man

[Verse 1: Dizzy Wright]
This year I mean all business authentic
Real verse fake it's easy to fall victim
Flowing keep it out going like across center
That's why when I see food I be having these raw dinners, wait
No jedi, look my nigga I'm getting used to it
Tough skin so I'm putting the tattoos to it
New skin so I'm known for spitting the truth fluent
I'm still moving but I ain't stopping until my crew moving like a tow truck
Smoking dope with the door shut
I told the homies that my concentration back
I'm Floyd May with the combination, the type they can't hit me
I'm got them dizzy, I'm definitely intact
Ring the alarm, I'm like CP4
Passionate on the court
But I'm building it with a state farm
My day ones like to kick it like Draymond
No high kicks but we as high as it gets
Let's go

[Hook]
Old school coming down on the Ave
All hands on me wanna touch no tag (no tag)
Counting up like I'm doin' the dash
Still movin on the way to a bag
(x2)

[Verse 2]
Hustled out of pocket, turned it into a profit
So many tried to block it but I did it regardless
Either you with us or you part of the problem
I know they want me back down on the bottom, I got 'em
It's all part of my process
How you get the Rolex and he ain't even nine yet
Nigga I'm immortal, I be thinking beyond death
I'ma live forever as long as they playing my song next
My blood burning like a fireplace, Henny with the water chase
And these niggas still hating like they Charlamagne
But I'm paying no mind, grinding, do me
Hotel filled with groupies with my homies flowing
Who we?

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Dizzy Wright]
Fifth year while these big years y'all been giving me
Self motivated, I'm the coldest with a [?]
All my riders, water and Hennessy
Ayo I came up balling, shit was a motherfucking gym to me
If you ain't dropping gems, you could drop like John Kennedy
I take that back cause look what God's given me
I can't complain, I'm working on a different me
You living life on the moon and you can't see it, whoa
So keep rolling up
The difference between you and I is you ain't woken up
As [?] I'm Jordan hitting the shoulder shrug
I'm tatted up like a subway, know how to cold a subs
And I'm in a bit of my New Yorker buzz
See I was in love with the music way before the love
It was rapping and boxing, that golden age of golden gloves
Diving in creating history on Simon's lands
And Reezy tell these niggas what we ridin in when we slide through

[Hook]
