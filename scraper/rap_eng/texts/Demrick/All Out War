It's all out war
It's all out war

Turn my hat to the back, left to the right
Step to the stage, press on the mic
Look in the crowd, get lost in the lights
This shit here's for the rest of your life
Tell me what you gonna say, how it's gonna feel
When you're finally reach in and go for the kill
Reality sets in, it's oh so real
Gotta keep it moving like a Oldsmobile
But wait, gotta form the troops
Case the perimeter and storm the roof
Let this shit here be the proof
A nigga told the truth just 'cuz he wore a suit
Didn't mean that he'd shoot when the war is on
Playin' for the other side all along
Gotta make it happen like fourth and long
'Cuz when the war is on, it's on

[Hook]
It's all out war
Some things are worth dying for
It's all out war
Tell me what are you fighting for
It's all out war, war, war, war
How much can you endure
It's all out war, war, war, war
There can only be one winner
It's all out


Hat to the front, fight to the left
Gotta go hard 'til there ain't shit left
Used to focus on the block, but then I had to step
Came a long way from the days on the steps
Dangerous minds, it ain't safe
I'll keep it in the safe so you ain't safe
Heart of a slave, kill the owner
First it was Wash, now it's Arizona
We write for what we love
Word to the streets how I got to bust
Ain't no case, they ain't got the glove
Stone cold shot, I got the slug
Watch back on who's watching us
Binoculars, they tried stoppin' us
They tried knockin' us, but we're not the one's
Just forgot, you've got to flaunt

[Hook]
It's all out war
Some things are worth dying for
It's all out war
Tell me what are you fighting for
It's all out war, war, war, war
How much can you endure
It's all out war, war, war, war
There can only be one winner
It's all out

Oh, oh, ohâ€¦

Gotta step to the podium, make the speech
They're runnin' wild, livin' off the leash
Shit gonna change when we take streets
Real motherf*ckers play for keeps
Got it on lock from A to Z
They're out there snitchin' to the agency
But all that talk don't mean a thing to me
Feel like the whole world got to explain to me
So I block, plan, words don't hurt
Like a shot can, say get down when I'm on cam
Try to play me out, nigga, no chance
Rememberin' the days when I sold grams
No I won't go with your program
Gotta stand up, I'm my own man
Own pride, on time, all mine

[Hook]
It's all out war
Some things are worth dying for
It's all out war
Tell me what are you fighting for
It's all out war, war, war, war
How much can you endure
It's all out war, war, war, war
There can only be one winner
It's all out
