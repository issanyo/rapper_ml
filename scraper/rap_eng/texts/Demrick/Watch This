(Watch this)
Yeah I see you watching
I’ma let ‘em count the moves, I just count the profit
Independent, bitch we did it out our pocket
And now this shit is poppin’, ain’t no way to stop it
(Watch this)

(Watch this, watch this)
Everybody watching
Now this shit is poppin’
(Watch this, watch this)

[Verse 1] Demrick
I can tell they watching, I know they love it
When I’m out public and I’m on stage people bomb rushing
I’m out the country, grab the luggage
If it’s in the budget and they got the [?]
We ‘gon come and crush it
Fuck it, I kill the stages, I kill the stages
Step up the plate and they lookin’ shocked
Liquor shot at these crooked cops
Brothers trippin’ on televisions, everybody want what everybody got
But I’m doing me on a daily basis
Dirty money with the big faces
From the pavement, there’s no debating, in this entertainment I’m the fucking greatest
I kill shit!
(Watch this)
Might Scoop Deville bitch for a field trip
(Can I get a feel real quick? Are these real tits?)
Heads turning while my blunt burning
I ain’t concerned ‘cause I’m still earning
Switching lanes with my wheels turning
(Let’s go)

[Hook]
Yeah I see you watching
I’ma let ‘em count the moves, I just count the profit

[Verse 2] Demrick
She got a pocket full of drugs for bathroom. (woo)
I got a pocket full of ones for the back room. (yeah)
Told her DJ, play some shit that she could clap to
DJ please play some shit that she could clap to
Look at me, no hands
She ‘gon dirty dance for a couple bands
Call her “rubber band”, she always wrapped around the money, man
They don’t understand, I was born to do this
Smoke the good shit, avoid the bullshit
Scoopy looped it, it’s fucking heat
Fuck with me, we got the streets and the industry
Sometimes I feel like someone’s watching me
Don’t compare me to the others I ain’t trying to be
I used to push trees now watch out overseas
When these bitches want the D I say “get on your knees”
Hoe

[Hook]
Yeah I see you watching
I’ma let ‘em count the moves, I just count the profit

[Verse 3] Lil Debbie
Yo, if I clap before them you know they watching
Got ratchet bitches, they pussy poppin’
Got pole models, no role models
Gold bottles be the only option
I’m the baddest one as far as bitches go
‘Bout to get some more as far as riches go
Got six figures in my budget, fuck it
Only one life so I’ma live it hoe
Got a pocket full of kush for that swisher bitch
Type of pussy make you leave and never miss your bitch
Type of swagger, ain’t no taking, you can see I’m rich
Type of ass you want to eat then go and kiss your bitch
I’m shitting on ‘em, I’m shitting on ‘em
Look at me and tell me what you see
A slim friend doing big things, I’m everything bitches want to be
This white bitch be the right bitch
I turn ‘em out in one night, shit
They looking at me, I’m looking happy
I’m laughing my way to the bank, look!

[Hook] Demrick
Yeah I see you watching
