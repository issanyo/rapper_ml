[Intro: Xzibit]
Oh man, what up Knots?
Yeah, uh-huh
VA, yeah, LA, uh-huh

[Verse 1: Xzibit & Demrick]
"Isn't life grand?" isn't quite what you thinkin'
When you got one in your hands
I've evolved and advanced
Used to make that pussy dance with a pistol in my pants
You can ask the homie Lance in Vegas
Make your players hit the tables for 50 bands
Yeah, I'ma do it while I can
I'ma build a lowrider, then fly it to Japan
Yeah, a whole different man, new outlook on livin'
Clicks, likes are given, but
I've seen your IG, homie, that's not how you're livin'
With your prison cell phone, your phone got you sent to prison
Thankful for what I'm given and want not what I don't got
Yeah, I know seein' me makin' it was a longshot
Now go and get your fuckin' shine box
Ripley, Alien, blow you out the airlock

[Chorus: Xzibit & B-Real]
Oh, you think you got the upper hand? (Upper hand)
On my mama, got another plan (Yeah)
Cypress taught you how to kill a man (Kill a man)
But I'ma show you how to get away with it (With it)
With it, with it, get away with it
With it, with it, get away with it
With it, with it, get away with it
With it, show you how to get away

[Verse 2: Demrick & Xzibit]
Dead on arrival, flatline the vitals
This the payback, don't get your name scratched like a vinyl
White like albino, drunker than a wino
I came up from the shadows down a road less traveled
Niggas slip like gravel and get dropped like a gavel
My city where they trip off the colors of your flannel
Life's a gamble, gotta lead by example
I see niggas in shambles put in the can like Campbell's
Demrick young drop like a anvil
Drop the money off like BM, smokin' on the Camel
Haters just replenishin' my ammo
I should've been a Soprano, in tune like pianos

[Chorus: Xzibit & B-Real]
Oh, you think you got the upper hand? (Upper hand)
On my mama, got another plan (Yeah)
Cypress taught you how to kill a man (Kill a man)
But I'ma show you how to get away with it (With it)
With it, with it, get away with it
With it, with it, get away with it
With it, with it, get away with it
With it, show you how to get away

[Verse 3: B-Real]
On with the illest ever, yeah we the realest ever
Whether you ever admit it, we severed the head off a fuckin' giant
I'm David, fuck Goliath
Throwin' stones at your glass house, set it on fire and triumph
I got the keys to the getaway, yo, he want that-a-way
Scatter when the AK spray, yeah, Ã¡ndale
No one's seen a thing, no witnesses
No one even needs to make a comment, how lit this is
X what the business is
Wrappin' bitches up for Christmases
See me on the docks doin' christenings
Actin' like it's all reggie, but never smokin' reggie
And if you bringin' Reggie, it may get deadly
We ain't friendly

[Chorus: Xzibit & B-Real]
Oh, you think you got the upper hand? (Upper hand)
On my mama, got another plan (Yeah)
Cypress taught you how to kill a man (Kill a man)
But I'ma show you how to get away with it (With it)
With it, with it, get away with it
With it, with it, get away with it
With it, with it, get away with it
With it, show you how to get away
