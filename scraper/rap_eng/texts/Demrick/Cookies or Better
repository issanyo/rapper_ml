[Hook: Demrick]
Yeah, uh
Before all the weed smoke
All the liquor drank
All of these hoes chose and my money's in the bank
I let 'em know, "I do it"
Yeah, I let 'em know, "I do it"
I'mma make it last forever
Couple hoes down for whatever
Nigga say he got that fire, gotta be cookies or better
I let 'em know, "I do it"
Yeah, I let 'em know, "I do it"

[Verse 1: Demrick]
Let me light a little weed, catch my vibe too
Little Henny in my glass, you know how I do
Few bitches on my line, I'm thinking why choose?
When we can get together baby, you know it's whatever with me
Spinning through the city in that 7-50
Smoking something sticky, yeah, you fucking with me
She hit me like come and get me, I'm right there
With one in the air, her ex nigga nightmare
I'm on that player shit, white paper glass tip
Down to my last sips, stanking when the bag rip
I left my problems in the past with my last bitch
Take two puffs and pass

[Hook: Demrick]
Before all the weed smoke
All the liquor drank
All of these hoes chose and my money's in the bank
I let 'em know, "I do it"
Yeah, I let 'em know, "I do it"
I'mma make it last forever
Couple hoes down for whatever
Nigga say he got that fire, gotta be cookies or better
Let 'em know, "I do it"
Yeah, I let 'em know, "I do it"

[Verse 2: Berner]
I had to let them know, I had to let them go
Big bags, I had to grab the rose
The Xans, I'm moving slow
This bag is full of smoke
There's wax in that joint, I'm mad he didn't choke, shit
I came from California with a ten piece
Sold it when I landed, yeah the game still tempts me
Ice cold water with the Hemp C, I'm cold-hearted
I'm tipping bottles 'till they empty
This gold around my neck it get heavy while I ride in my Chevy with a stash so heady bring the glass if you ready
Uh, cause I'm tryna take a dab
We take 'em right off the slab

[Hook: Demrick & Dizzy Wright]
Before all the weed smoke
All the liquor drank
All of these hoes chose and my money's in the bank
I let 'em know, "I do it"
Yeah, I let 'em know, "I do it"
I'mma make it last forever
Couple hoes down for whatever
Nigga say he got that fire, gotta be cookies or better
Let 'em know, "I do it"
Y'all know how I do
Yeah, I let 'em know, "I do it"
Pull up one her like

[Verse 3: Dizzy Wright]
Smoking this joint kinda reminds me of you
Baby, don;t worry about me, be my Eryka Badu
Twist me up and do my dew
Would pull up, but I flew
Now I'm smoking
Nah, ain't tripping, wasn't really in the mood
Situated now I'm faded
Happy on snappy 'bout to snap about it
Graduated stunner, ask B-Real and Mr. Cap about it
Captain dabber rap about it
Bubble up and held the smoke
That's THC that's on my breath
They kicked me in my chest for sure
Get up off my testicles, got a Swisher from the Texaco
I can't even smoke in peace without niggas tryna let me know
They setting goals to be right where I'm at, at all these festivals
But I'm laughing off these edibles, puffing medical cause man
