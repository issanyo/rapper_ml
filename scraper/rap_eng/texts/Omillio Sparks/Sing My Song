Till I'm gone nigga sing my song, nigga sing my song
Omilio just trying get over let me catch a nigga trying to get over
Till I'm gone sing my song, nigga sing my song
Omilio just trying get over let me catch ya nigga

I come from scrambling and gambling men
Starving stomach touching I hustle with the hand of hand men
But the ambition got the tables turning
Cuz now I coach coke up for the post
I let seven go like Chicago did Tony Kukoc
Let them falls revolve through a ski coat
Keep in mind this nigga ain't got no dough
Committed crime and all he did was switch coke
And that's gangsta
In the hood that I know 4 niggas at least 7 dead
And 3 injured and that's danger
Enough to put the cops under pressure
That's why we never listen to mami's lectures
The techs the only thing that can protect ya
That's why we scream fuck these coppers
And tote gats big enough that as soon as they poppin
Have you screaming louder then the opera
Now roam through the streets of Philly
With a nigga so you can understand a lil betta

(Omilio Sparks)
Till I'm gone nigga sing my song, nigga sing my song
Omilio just trying get over let me catch a nigga trying to get over
Till I'm gone sing my song, nigga sing my song
Omilio just trying get over let me catch ya nigga

Yo my song is like Louis Armstrong's but instead of blowing the flute
I was blowing Glocks of the roof
I've seen a lot of my friends in a box in a suit
It happens so often you don't get a chance to regroup
My life is like a song and I'm singing this sad ballad
Wearing that same weared sweater like Fat Albert
One thing about O you can't call him a snitch
Been shot nine times and never approached the bench
Remember us struggling like it was just yesterday
Matter of fact it was yesterday
Welcome to the ghetto this close to a hearse
At a funeral the first time I went in a church
But I pray to Allah to panewat the aisle
I can't crack down man I got to be a fighter
The song don't change cuz we signed to a lable
We still caught bad breaks like Hardaway ankles

(Omilio Sparks)
Till I'm gone nigga sing my song, nigga sing my song
Omilio just trying get over let me catch a nigga trying to get over
Till I'm gone sing my song, nigga sing my song
Omilio just trying get over let me catch ya nigga

Yo now Jeremiah stay madder then a muthafucka
Till he had 40 money champagne wishes
Argues on corners with hood rat bitches
Looking at what he had for role models bunch a alcoholics and junkies
Riding in 77 caddies smoking on Woollies tote on long rusty revolvers
Sticking up young workers for they packages
Like fuck coppers cuz basically the Rolling Stones be homeless
So when the cops catch us they don't run from em
They figure three hots and a cot it'll be alright with em
Plus niggas they ain't seen in a while they be uniting there
Making home made wine shooting the breeze
Smoking squares at the chi chis
Self-made whackers razorblades tape and toothbrushes
Life is school to the new comers
Shit the closest they come to the bricks
Is Donald Goines books
Life's a bitch in the beginning

Till I'm gone nigga sing my song, nigga sing my song
Omilio just trying get over let me catch a nigga trying to get over
Till I'm gone sing my song, nigga sing my song
Omilio just trying get over let me catch ya nigga
