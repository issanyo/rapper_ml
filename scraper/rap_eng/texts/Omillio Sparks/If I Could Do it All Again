That's deep uhh
This some of that get you through your day music that's right
I want ya'll to ride with me

[Hook: repeat 4X]
If if if if if if if if if
If I could do it all again I promise you I would do it different

[Sparks]
If I could turn back the hands of time
I swear I'd go back to spendin a little more time with my grandmom
I remember her smile just like it was yesterday
And her tellin me "kid stay away from the knuckleheads"
But me being a hardhead I'd run to the block anyway
Me and D'bo forty-drinkin', weed-smokin', servin' fiends til the mornin'
Coming home young and restless
Grandma downstairs waiting watchin' the Young & Restless
Soap opera's smilin' happy to see me
Still in one piece deep down she worried bout me
But I'm too young, dumb, and blind to see
They say you don't miss your water until your well run dry
My grandma died man I cried so hard
I swear if I could turn the hands of time I'd to it all over again
I'd been there right by her bed in Mesricordia hospital I swear, yeah

Flatline here comes the doctor I see my momma break down my god
Now I done seen tears fall from the face of a hustla
But screams from my mom sent pain through my spine
So I got to embrace her
I scream momma were all gonna miss nana but you got to get yourself together
Stand strong for her o.k. momma I gotcha
Doctor screaming uh-ha there's nothing else we can do for her
Past hours up with family members bringing balloons and flowers
Sign this signature we all goin miss you grandmama
My nieces and nephews they standing and they confused
Want to know why everyone's crying
I tell em' grandmother's gone away
And she gonna be gone for a long time o.k
And where she's gone it's a better place
You know blue skies white clouds now go and play with Kensache o.k

If I could do it again, I would do it different
Less time spent in prison, more time in religion
Less time talking more time listening
Learning observing went to school fucked around and been a surgeon
But the hands of time do not go back
And all my niggas in the dirt in the box they will not come back
Rest in peace Mark, Troy, Ant, Schiz, Mann, Wayne, Rob
All the young niggas who died before they time
From a place where you deal with the blues
Been shot more than Pac but I ain't make the news
Walk with me, if I could do it again
I can't so I deal with the past
Like Texas inmates deal with the gas
If I die it's no surprise if it's not from old age
But from a young angry nigga with an old gauge
The ghetto motherfucker times is mean
We'd love to have Michael J. Fox time machine
