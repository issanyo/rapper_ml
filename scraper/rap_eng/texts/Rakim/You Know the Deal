Uh, Uh, Yeah

[Hook: Lloyd Banks] {"Rakim"}
Ay I'm focused now, they notice now
Shorty to ride with me you got to hold this down
But you ain't got to worry cause we run this town
A nigga run up on me will get his ass gunned down....

"You know the deal, it's all about a Dollar Bill
You know the deal, it's all about a Dollar Bill
You know the deal, it's all about a Dollar Bill
Get dough fo'reals, the only way that I can chill"

[Verse 1: Lloyd Banks]
Uh, niggas won't understand 'til they man fall
From a exit wound big as a handball, damn y'all
Can a nigga spend a mill
For a house on the hill as tall as a Ferris wheel?
Niggas better chill - for the Barretta peel
Knock off your head and ill, whole bunch of red'll spill
Nigga I'm rollin' up, system blowin', hater's glowin' up - frozen up
Range Rover truck color Coconut
I used to be broke ass fuck, 'til I woke 'em up
I'll show you how to choke a slut, get in her throat and gut
Then it's back to postin' up, wheels pokin' out
Smoke about enough to have you gaspin' and chokin' out
I - do what I wanna when I wanna ball when it's summer
Leave out the club, squeeze 'em all in the Hummer
Stitching in the seats, interior Peanut Butter
Brand new Pelle Pelle, Nine-millimeter under

You know the deal, it's all about a Dollar Bill

[Verse 2: Lloyd Banks]
Uh, Banks is back yeah the punchline boy
You've got to be a millionaire to touch my toy
I figured, I'll let the haters see it one more time
I skied off zero to sixty in three-point-nine
Besides, I gotta make the jewellery store on time
I look like I bought the jewellery store this time
And it's hard to live like a Rap Star on the cover
I got three Magnums - the gun, the car, the rubber
I got a fur fetish, a three-quarter cut habbit
Nigga that ain't chinchilla, it's plucked parrot
Park rabbit, go find your heart faggot
I pray niggas find your foot and toe tag it
There ain't never a drought, I got the sour on tour
So raw I gotta hotel towel the door
Hoes all around the hotel piled to the floor
They done followed your boy since two-thousand and four

[Verse 3: Lloyd Banks]
From here on out it's manslaughter for the masses
And classics courtesy of Mr. Mathers
You bastards heard of me I get the cash
It's the American way I go to bed with the 'K
I got red, blue and white don't even ask about ice
I look like a cop car flashin' his lights
All he want to do is chit chat and make tapes about him
'Til they lost like Malcolm before the Nation got him
I dun timbaland tan the coup, my wrist chunky like Campbells soup
Niggas shoot, I done been around the world
And I'm right here you won't hurt me
I'll put your ass on ice yeah - cold turkey
I'm blowin' Purple - the Haze mixed with Hershey
I done gave you style, now reimburse me
And it ain't no more love you get the "Birdie"
I'mma be in the number one spot 'til I'm thirty, ya heard me?
