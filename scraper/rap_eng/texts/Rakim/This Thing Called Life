[Hook: King Myers]
I don't think words can describe how I feel, here
They tried to knock me down but I'm still, here
I think we all know that it's real here, in this thing that we call life
We only got one tell me if I'm wrong
I hope you remember me when I'm gone
And while everybody singin' my song
I'mma live this thing that we call life

[Verse 1: King Myers]
I picture it well, got the game locked sick of the cell
Young dude witta dream & I'm livin it well
Alotta beautiful women to whom beauty is given
If I see them & I like 'em then I'm usually wit 'em
It be the, baddest ones wit the mean demeanor
The bad things in life always seem to please to us
And when they say you changin people think of you wrong
Until they see you once then the next day you gone
See I'm just livin' mine, I ain't tryna die poor
I ain't tryna be broke when death knock at my door
Nah, I want the finer things, big timer things
Wrist gotta shine, ears gotta bling
You can't live life runnin' & duckin'
But you could live life turning nothin' to somethin'
Make the best outta everything, but be cautious
You know that you makin money when they keep callin'

[Hook: King Myers]

[Verse 2: Rakim]
Life ain't a game but I'm winning, knowing my opponent is deaf
Lovin' every minute 'til not a moment is left
Like I ain't gotta moment to rest before they bury me
The goal's to be known as the best & hope the legacy
Is what immortal is, performances stun 'em
The enormous lifts street corners get from him
Then all the chicks love him
Then all the enforcin' in (steve?) moral is E Pluribus Unum
Everyday we gets money
I'm good, I'm still spendin' '86 money
Pull up in that new brink truck banked up
Soon as these niggas get caked up, they bankrupt, or banged up
Soon as I step foot on the curb
I get the love in the hood I deserve
For puttin' in work, supply it like you cook it & serve
Still so good it's absurd, how I feel is hard to put it in words

[Hook: King Myers]

[Verse 3: King Myers]
Everybody get a chance at life, but everybody ain't livin' it right
Money has no value if you ain't spendin' it right
Bad girls get like targets when they get to the light
So that's exactly why I'm hittin 'em right
I'm on my track, I don't think I ever used a road
Down memory lane is where I used to stroll
No hands but I wonder what my future holds
I want cake cause I'm used to dough
When I be ridin' through the city I be doin' all kinds of things
Keepin' it a hunnet wit dimes hopin' minds'll change
I'm takin' chances, tryna turn a mission into a mansion
Tryna turn any mishap 'to a house in the Hamptons
But it's all good, you live life just to want things
You livin right when you can flaunt things
And I don't know when ima leave this world so I'mma show it all
Put the candles on the cake I'mma blow it all
