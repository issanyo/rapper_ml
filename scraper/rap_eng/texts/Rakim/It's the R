[Verse 1]
It's Mr. Lowkey you need to go see
The host by far a mostly O.T
With a brand new show but you know how the flow be
Cause when I swerve, you observe it closely
If you smoke trees, smoke more than an OZ
Mix any kind of dope with me, you OD
You get the CD, LP, C-O-D
Poetry cause you to fully load the V
Drop place to place be crazy over me
Even different nationalities, overseas
However do a don't emcee, you know me
(My name is Rakim Allah) G-O-D
She know she D-O-E, so show me
Even with no jewelry she call me Goldie
Like a Jacuzzi she overheat an OG
Like sushi swimmin' in a open sea (I'm comin')

[Instrumental Scratches]
"The R"
"Rakim is on the mic"
"I'm the R, the A, to the K-I-M"
"The most popular demand and rap classic"
"If I wasn't then why would I say I am?"

[Verse 2]
She said it's the same since I came and rained, it's still hard
You can stimulate the brain, feel the God
It's hard to go against the grain, it's real large
Drive'em insane leave dames in silk bras
Plus real cups spill, spill that bars
What's the deal? Kids with Hennessy grills, they feel charged
And you know what time it is? It's still Ra's
When I do a show real far they steal cars
Stages of battle field reveal your scars
Train hard, cause this is a game with ill squads
Play with pain and gain a couple of yards
And if you know the deal, you can deal the cards
And appeal to broads with jobs and OV-E-OD's
Body parts like buns of steel and spa's
Then we can kick the blahzay blah, smoke a cigar
While I get ma-na-massage
I'm comin'

[Instrumental Scratches]
"The R"
"Rakim is on the mic"
"I'm the R, the A, to the K-I-M"
"The most popular demand and rap classic"
"If I wasn't then why would I say I am?"

[Verse 3]
From the inner city to the suburbs, the street poet
The most jiggiest kid with words, and peeps know it
They've read about it and heard, plus TV show it
So how do I reserve my swerve? I low pro it
Now there eager to know just how deep the flow get
I don't know yet, sometime the flow be so wet
Spit a tech that will effect quicker than Moet
Or high as anything you smoke yet, go ahead roll it
Any microphone I hold, my heat blow it
My M.O. is make more dough till I can't fold it
Anything I see or touch, I wanna own it
Drop a jewel in baby girl ear, now she my co-ed
I re-load and she keep the candy coated
And when she know she can't control it
She tell me she about to blow at any moment
Well go ahead baby I can't hold it (I'm comin')
