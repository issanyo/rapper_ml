(sample No Doubt's "Don't Speak")

[Hook]
(You and me) You and me
(We used to be together) used to be
(Everyday together) everyday
(Always) always

You was there from the beginning all I had to do was to vibe
In a race against millions where the loser die
No rules apply but you was my safe haven
At the end of the race waiting so I used your guide
I found heaven in you, you shared your life with me
Gave me insight, way before the light hit me
It's more than just a bond cause we inseparable
Even when they cut the cord on the umbilical
Never more than a moment away
You fixed whatever was wrong and always know what to say
The same way to my sisters and brothers
Always honest and showed me what unconditional love is
The voice of a goddess, and stars twinkle in your eyes
My heaven on earth or an angel in disguise
If you was here, I'd just hug and kiss you
Cause a million words can't explain how much I miss you

[Hook]

I watched the lady shine and stay on the grind
While the world weighed heavy on a ladies mind
It was a crazy time
It's like the world stopped fast when pops passed in '89
Harder we cried the harder you cried too
My father kept your blue skies blue
It's hard to keep going, the harder you try too
At January 18th part of you died too
You tried to be stronger keep the fam together
You said we had to keep on and plan for better
While you smile with your open arms
It took awhile to die-tect your broken heart
You said it takes some time take it slow
But time will take it's toll and the stakes is high 'til the day you die
But I refused to accept eventually that I would have to say goodbye

You and me, We used to be together
Everyday together, Always
I really feel, that I'm losing my best friend
I can't believe this could be, the end

I'm starting to see how short life is
Every second it get shorter but your heart get warmer
And you get stronger even when they said you need a transplant
And dialysis to live longer
It put us in fear, put us in tears
You still managed to live life to the fullest for years
Then things got complicated, they found a donor so they operated
A gift and a curse, it's a risk, will it work
And concerned, then things took a turn for the worse
And even if I'd seen the signs I doubt the actions
Nothing could prepare me for what was 'bout to happen
In the hospital, the 18th floor, vivid
July 18th, 2005, I can't forget it
Since that day, I'm forever numb
The end, the day I hoped would never come
