Rakim:
Who want low boats of keys from overseas
Then put it in the streets and spread like a disease
Neighborhoods infected then misdirected
It ain't no cure and it's hard to correct it
Bless by the most high cursed by the lowest
Used to think the quick now thoughts travel the slowest
Close to comatose brain waves rigamortist
You forget the skit the most high tortoise
I remember so they wanna murder RA
Know what I mean because I got knowledge of self
Yeah I know, you probably don't believe me
But be easy I'm gonna leave it up to Barrington Levy

Barrington Levy:

That prejudge end up a hearse, who god bless no man curse
I'm gonna end up in a hearse, because they maskata
Murderer (4x)

Rakim:
Here they come, known bloodsuckers of the poor
Rob us for culture and now they want more
Caution they come in many forms of identity
A lot to suspect so detect the enemy
Worst than a mosquito or a vampire
They're not sitting at the movies or a campfire
Huh, yeah, I know you don't believe me, be easy I'm gonna leave it to
Barrington Levy

Barrington Levy:

Dress up in a jacket, then dress up in a tie

Murderer (4x)

Murderer (2x)

Rakim:
Bless by the most high, cursed by the lowest
