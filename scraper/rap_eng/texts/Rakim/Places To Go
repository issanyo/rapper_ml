[Intro]
I got, I got
I got places to
Actin' like they feelin' my pain, my pain
I got places to go
I got, I got
I got places to
Actin' like they feelin' my pain, my pain
I got places to go

[Verse 1]
I feel like we should get together
Then maybe I, I'll feel so much better
And this rainy weather ain't helpin'
Boys in leather jackets
They are walkin' by
Yeah they remind me
How tiring love is
I just wanna fly away and ignore this
I just wanna call it quits, I'm a quick fix
While he's out there taking his
I just need someone to break this wall of bricks I've built

[Chorus]
So I wanna know
What's the weather like in Toronto
This time of the year
It should be so cold
But I just need another place to go
Cause I can't be here no more, no more

[Break]
I got, I got
I got places to
Actin' like they feelin' my pain, my pain
I got places to go

[Verse 2]
I feel like work is overbearing me
And what is life when you are not even living?
I am tired of it all, pleasing everyone I know
Cause when I do it, I don't know if it's worth it
How tiring work is, yeah
I just wanna fly away and ignore this
Sometimes I wanna call it quits cause it's a business
Everyone is making hits
I just wanna take a break from everything that I've been

[Chorus]
So I wanna know
What's the weather like in New York
This time of the year
It should be so cold
But I just need another place to go
Cause I can't be here no more, no more
Cause I wanna know
What's the weather like in Kuala Lumpur
This time of the year
It's so beautiful
I just need a place to call home
Cause I can't be here no more, no more

[Outro]
Here no more, no more
I got places to go
Here no more
Actin' like they feelin' my pain, my pain
I got places to go
I can't be here no more, no more, no more
I got places to go
Actin' like they feelin' my pain, my pain
I got places to go
