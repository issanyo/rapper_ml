Verse 1

Lyrics make me a menace
When it's in a sentence then it's finished
More pure than raw, much more above the law
I don't go on tour, I go to war
Stompin' COMP perform a similar style
Rhymes attack 91 rap exile
Cause every word I said'll be deadly
An MC murderer, science is steadily
Giving me new ways and methods
Melodies and medleys, weapons for records
Tactics lethal, perhaps it's illegal
Scorching, I'm torching cause that's how we do
Set your entire empire on fire
So give me a mic without a wire
Cause every dose is highly explosive
Mr. Dynamite, the man with most of
The blueprints and master plans, the potential
Data process stored in the mental
Then I get physical and hit you with another hit
The brother's it, and nothing's equivalent

Verse 2

Mind of mine so divine, one of a kind
Life gave lemonade, I made my flavor green lime
Chasing the green light in a hot pursuit
Rockin’  em’ baggy jeans and construction boots
Soul Survivor, able to put out the fire lit by Cain (Kane)
Ideas turn to golden weapons, Suddam Hussein
Alpha to Omega, I was the inventa’ of hip-hop
Pushed in the door with my big toe like I was slippin’ on flip flops
The creator, raps initiator since its Genesis
Check the First Testament
The God who created the worlds elements with precise measurements
Rakim Allah absorbs your detriments, and writes a verse
So influential I eliminate your devilish thirst
The games been cursed and I’m the magician
Leave opponents in a hearse for trying to claim first position
God incarnate, the marksman sergeant
Teach em’ where to aim to hit their goals and targets
I fathered this rap game, plain and simple
Incorporated hip-hop with poetry and riddles
My mind is so deep sharks can’t swim with my thoughts
Whale (Will) they swim to the shallow with the fishes and lobs.,
It don’t matter, the underground still too hard to survive
I could swim under the sea with the beasts and be the only one still alive
Do or die if you scuba dive in the league I roam
Turn hardcore rappers into sponges and Styrofoam
I stand alone, the messenger to slay the monster
From Moses parting the Red Sea to me, the Godfather
Rakim Allah…..

First Verse Written by Rakim. Second Verse Written by Patrick Yousif as if he was Rakim and spoke from Rakim Allah's point of view in the rap game. Just having some fun trying to imitate Rakim's style. Once again, First Verse Written by Rakim himself, Second Verse is written by a fan (Patrick) pretending to be Rakim...
