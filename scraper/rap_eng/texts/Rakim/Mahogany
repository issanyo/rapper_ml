[Verse 1]
Me and Eric B was coolin’ at the Palladium
Seen a all-world cover girl, I said hey lady I’m
Sorry if you’re in a rush - don’t let me hold you up
Or intervene or interrupt, but
You got the look - I wanna get to know you better
I had to let her know - but yo, I didn’t sweat her
Cause if you would've seen what I was seein'
Almost looked Korean, but European
When she spoke, her accent was self-explanatory
Even her body language told the story
Her name was Mahogany - twin’s name was Ebony
I said my name is Ra and this is Eric B
Since the music was loud, I said let’s take a walk
So we could talk and see New York
Show time didn't start until one o’clock
But once I entered your mind I wouldn’t wanna stop
Caress your thoughts til we was thinking the same
Calm your nerves, massage your brain
Each moment's a mineral, poetry’s protein
Verse is a vitamin, affects like codeine
So tell me how you feel and I’ll reveal
A pill that’ll heal ya pain, ’cause I’m real
She musta OD’d ’cause she couldn’t resist
She spoke slowly when she told me this, she said

[Hook]
Over me, she’s goin’ crazy
She’ll rub me on my chest and call me Mr. Sexy
She said she’d have my kids and help me make my next G
Tell me I ain’t finessed mahogany

[Verse 2]
So I prescribed her, something to revive
And surprise her, she’s liver and much more wiser
From the light I shine when my brain cells spark
Constantly so she can glow in the dark
And soon, you can represent the moon
As long as I keep you in tune
I’ll tell you who you are and why you're here
Take it in stride ’cause it might take a year
It’s funny - how time flies when you're havin’ fun
We got close and it was almost one
She kissed me slow, but you know how far a kiss can go
Fuck around and miss the show
So I told her to hold that thought real tight
We can finish where we left off later on tonight
Back to the scene of the crime on time
As they introduced the fiend of a rhyme
She stood in the crowd with a birds-eye view of me
Thinking of later on of what she would do to me
The back of the room I could see her eyes - gloom
Patient, but hoping that the show was over soon
As the place was ripped in half, she made her way to the front row
So I said let’s go
I packed my mic as they screamed for an encore
The speakers were blown, plus my mic was sore
Besides I got places to go, ladies to see
And she could tell me how crazy she was over me
We drove off - she said she liked the way that I performed
And couldn’t wait to get 'soft and warm', I said
"I was watching you, watching me
Looks I received made it hard to MC"
I can take a hint, so I knew that she
Wanted my agony agony ag-on-y in her bod-y
Drove to some sights, then I took her to the condo
She was pipin’ hot, but I kept my calm so
She asked how come I don’t smile
I said, everything’s fine, but I’m in a New York state of mind
As we reached the kingdom, she said bring some
Champagne, she’ll entertain then sing some
Sentimental, songs real gentle
It hit the spot and you know where it went to
As we embraced I felt her heart pumpin’
I knew she was in the mood for somethin’
So I laid on my back and relaxed
It wasn’t the Perignon that made her collapse

[Hook]
Over me, she’s goin’ crazy
She’ll rub me on my chest and call me Mr. Sexy
She said she’d have my kids and help me make my next G
Tell me I ain’t finessed mahogany
