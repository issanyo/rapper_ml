It's Saturday mornin' I'm off from work
Later on tonight, it's the time for the mic expert
Yeah, but I won't lose my shirt
Since I'm smooth I play it cool like Herc
I go to the park and play some ball
I ain't that tall but I bet I can slay 'em all
Ball handle like a Louie Vuitton suitcase
But I lost the ball when I saw a cute face
Cause girlies me rollin' around 11 o'clock
I'm on the court hot not missing the shots
She sat on the bench by the fence, it was time to move
Looking intense, but everything's cool

She was watching every move that I made
And I seen a smile every time I got paid
Then I had a thought what was she doin' later on
Went down court, turned around she was gone
I still had a memory of her physical chemistry
If I saw her again I'm sure she'll remember me
Played til it was dark and went back to the apartment
They quit cuz they know I'm the last brother to start with
Jumped in the car then I'm gone
To chill at the rest til the party later on
In the cassette deck was Kid Capri
Drove up the block and what did the kid see?
Girl from the park, well she eyeballin' me
Turned the base down was she callin' me?
Provoked to the sidewalk through talk
One wrong move I won't rule
But everything's cool
