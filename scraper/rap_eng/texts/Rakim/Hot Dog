[Intro]
Ladies and gentlemen!
Introducing the Chocolate Starfish
And the Hotdog Flavored Water
Bring it on!
Get the fuck up!
Yeah, check, one, two
Listen up, listen up!
Here we go! (here we go!)

[Verse 1]
It's a fucked up world and a fucked up place
Everybody's judged by their fucked up face
Fucked up dreams, fucked up life
A fucked up kid with a fucked up knife
Fucked up moms and fucked up dads
It's a fucked up a cop with a fucked up badge
Fucked up job with fucked up pay
And a fucked up boss, this a fucked up day
Fucked up press with fucked up lies
While Lethal's in the back with the fucked up eyes

[Bridge]
Hey (It's on!)
Everybody knows it's on
Hey (It's on!)
Everybody knows it's on

[Verse 2]
Ain't it a shame that you can't say "Fuck"
Fuck's just a word and it's all fucked up
Like a fucked up punk with a fucked up mouth
A nine inch nail, I'll get knocked the fuck out
Fucked up AIDS from fucked up sex
Fake-ass titties on a fucked up chest
We're all fucked up, so what you wanna do?
With fucked up me and fucked up you?

[Chorus]
You wanna fuck me like an animal?
You'd like to burn me on the inside?
You like to think that I'm a perfect drug?
Just know that nothin' you do will bring you closer to me

[Verse 3]
Ain't life a bitch? A fucked up bitch
A fucked up sore with a fucked up stitch
A fucked up head, it's a fucked up shame
Swingin' on my nuts is a fucked up game
Jealousy fillin' up a fucked up mind
It's real fucked up like a fucked up crime
If I say "Fuck" two more times
That's 46 "Fuck"s in this fucked up rhyme

[Bridge]
Hey (It's on!)
Everybody knows it's on
Hey (It's on!)
Everybody knows it's on

[Chorus]
You wanna fuck me like an animal?
You'd like to burn me on the inside?
You like to think that I'm a perfect drug?
Just know that nothin' you do will bring you closer to me

[Interlude]
Hoo-haa, haaw! Listen up, baby!
You can't bring me (bring me) down
I don't think so, I don't (fuck) think so
You better check your (check it) self
Before you wreck yourself
Kiss my starfish, my chocolate starfish, punk!
Kiss my starfish, my chocolate starfish

[Chorus]
You wanna fuck me like an animal?
You wanna burn me on the inside?
You like to think that I'm a perfect drug?
Just know that nothin' you do will bring you closer to me
