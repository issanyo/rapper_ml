[Verse : Rakim]
First it was off and on
We kinda lost the bond
'Cause I was always gone
But I'm a cautious Don
I check the pros and cons
And made the forces strong
We grew close and fond
Now it's soft and warm
The way we kiss and hug
Make me miss your love
And if this is love
I won't forget your love
I'll make you miss this thug
Like a mystic drug
You the distant love
I'm reminiscing of
How it used to be
How will the future be
What you do to me
Baby you for me
You gettin' used to me
You gettin' loose for me
You seducing me
It's exclusively
We cannot regret
How I got you wet
You cannot forget
Baby, not just yet
I caress with finesse
Till it's lots of sweat
You High Tech
Plus you hot to death
I'm feelin' you

[Chorus: ?]
You know I don't care how much cash you got
Or how many times you like to blast your Glock
Your benz, your ice, or your master spot
Or the flow is fast or not [?]
I like it when you rise to the top like an astronaut
Touch me all over you don't have to stop
Until you put my body into aftershock
It's hot, baby that's the spot
(I'm feelin' you)

[Verse 2: Rakim]
We've been through ups and downs
With this love we found
We've been around and round
Well, baby trust me now
No fuss allowed
And plus we vowed
That it must be now
Reach out and touch me now
Yo, you smooth with yours
The way you move with yours
Your cool with yours
It's like "Ohh" with yours
You ooze across
Even your shadow soothe the floors
When your gone, your perfume stay glued to walls
You got the softest lips
You're proportionate
It's always more to grip
You's a gorgeous chick
Yo, I'm enforcing it
You keep the torches lit
And when I'm flossin' it
It's some exhausting shit
So, here's looking at you
About to attack you
I tickle your back, boo
Look at your tattoo
You make me do what I have to do to attract you
But, that's you
You never act new
I'm feelin' you

[Chorus: ?]
You know I don't care how much cash you got
Or how many times you like to blast your Glock
Your benz, your ice, or your master spot
Or the flow is fast or not [?]
I like it when you rise to the top like an astronaut
Touch me all over you don't have to stop
Until you put my body into aftershock
It's hot, baby that's the spot
(I'm feelin' you)

[Verse 3: Rakim]
We on the up and up
Rut em' up for what
It's like our love is up
No more fuckin' up
It don't mean nothin' but
Us clutchin' up
Until we love to lust
I wanna touch you up
No more trials and trips
Your smile's a gift
Your styles swiss
You used to get wild and flip
When I was around the clique
You toned it down a bit
It don't quit
Eh yo, no more childish shit
You get my all and all
If we fall we fall
Maybe it's all because love ain't got no flaws
But, I'm sure you'll adore
What the future stores
I'll make your juices pour
I want more and more
And if this is the spot
That always gets you hot
'Course if it's not
I'll push it up a notch
And hit a different spot
Until you hit the top
And ah yeah, baby this is hot
I'm feelin' you

[Chorus: ?]
You know I don't care how much cash you got
Or how many times you like to blast your Glock
Your benz, your ice, or your master spot
Or the flow is fast or not [?]
I like it when you rise to the top like an astronaut
Touch me all over you don't have to stop
Until you put my body into aftershock (yeah, baby)
It's hot, baby that's the spot
(I'm feelin' you)
