[02. Eric B and Rakim - I Know You Got Soul]
TUTORIAL LA MIXTAPE

[Kase.O] (Rap Solo Studio)

[Verso 1]
It's been a long time, I shouldn't have left you
Without a strong rhyme to step to
Think of how many weak shows you slept through
Time's up, I'm sorry I kept you
Thinking of this, you keep repeating, you miss
The rhymes from the microphone soloist
So you sit by the radio, hand on the dial, soon
As you hear it, pump up the volume
Dance with the speaker till you hear it blow
Then plug in the headphone 'cause here it go
It's a four letter word when it's heard, it control
Your body to dance (You got it) soul
Ditects the tempo like a red alert
Reaches your reflex, and let it work
When this is playing, you can't get stuck with
The steps, so get set and I'm a still come up with
A gift to be swift, follow the leader, the rhyme will go
Def with the record that was mixed a long time ago
It can be done but only I can do it
For those that can't dance, just clap your hands to it
I start to think and then I sink
Into the paper like I was ink
When I'm writing, I'm trapped in between the lines
I escape when I finish the rhyme...
I got soul

[Hook]
You got it
You got it
You got it
You got it
I know you got soul

[Verso 2]
Picture a mic, the stage is empty
A beat like this might tempt me
To pose, show my rings and my fat gold chain
Grab the mic like I'm on Soul Train
But I wait cause I mastered this
Let the others go first so the brothers don't miss
Eric B. break the sticks (you got it)
Rakim will begin when you make the mix
I'll experiment like a scientist
You wanna rhyme, you gotta sign my list
Cause I'm a manifest and bless the mic I hold
You want it next? then you gotta have soul
Cause if you ain't got it, I'm a make an encore
Take the mic, make the people respond for
The R, cause that's the way it'll have to be
If you wanna get on after me
Think about it, wait, erase your rhyme
Forget it and don't waste your time
Cause I'll be in the crowd if you ain't controlling it
Drop the mic, you shouldn't be holding it
(This is how it should be done) (x7)
This style is identical to none
Some try to make it sound like this but you're getting me
So upset that I'm wet cause you're sweating me
I drip steam like a microphone fiend
Eager to MC is my theme
I get hype when I hear a drum roll
Rakim is on the mic and you know I got soul

[Hook]
You got it
You got it
You got it
You got it
