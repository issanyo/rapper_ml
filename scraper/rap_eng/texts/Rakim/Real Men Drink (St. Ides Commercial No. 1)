Let me see if I can find one of them funky St. Ides commercials on the radio man:

[tunes radio]

Wait a minute, I know where to find one

[Radio DJ}
Yeah that was DJ Pooh, here's a word from our sponsor

[Male Voice]
Yeah here we go, right here, check it out

[Rakim]
Mmm, I need something refreshin'
When I get finished manifestin'
Too cold to hold, bold like Smith & Wesson
One caught and my thought's hip hop related
Write a rhyme and my pen's intoxicated
Lyrics are quicker with a sip of malt liquor
Since I'm a city slicker, brain waves are quicker
Rhymes I create, rotate
At a rate too quick to duplicate
Feel the breeze as I skate
Mic's at Fahrenheit when I hold it real tight
Then I'm in flight, then we ignite
Blood starts to boil, I heat up the party for you
Let my girl rub me and my mic down with oil
Records still turn with third degree burns
[?] man, I heat up your brain, give it a suntan
So just cool, let the temperature rise
You're coolin' off, with St. Ides

[Female Voice]
Ooh, so this is what a real man drinks. Thank you Rakim
