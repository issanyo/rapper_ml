"Levantaré"

[Verse 1]
Yeah, it's just ghetto, kid test the devil to hit the next level
Wish they was a rebel with cerebral metal
Inflex the bezzle with the peddle to the metal
In a thug's paradise where love have a price
So we love for life like thugs love the night
They sell drugs for ice for the Benz with bug lights
Some hug mics to the world, hung like parasites
But life's lethal, and might mislead you
A sneak preview, watch what we do and what the hood teach you
I still see through the eye of a needle
So I can watch people
Because love backwards is evil

[Verse 2]
Yo, what's this? Yo bust this. Yo it's time to uplift
They think all we do is bust clips and puff splifs
And plush whips and clutch chips and touch chicks
Flont rocks like Fort Knox and hawk blocks
Taunt cops with more props and we want not
Panhandling with your mans and them
Scrambling, gambling, plans to win
While the cops clock em, fiends flock em
Women watch em, traders wanna top em
Ay yo what's the problem
Before the narcs knock em obviously playas plot to rob em
The ghetto got em, my man said it's rough at the bottom

[Verse 3]
Ghetto alert, let's do whatever work to get rid of the curse
We went from 1st to America's worst
On this competitive turf, now let's inherit the earth
Let's form plots with one another, and call shots
From 12:00 til the next ball drop
All year around cause we suffer non stop
You think it's rough at the bottom, it's even rougher on top
My peeps gonna have to reach and turn for me
And everybody's side of the street'll be sunny
Ain't nothing funny, burn plenty of firm honeys
And earn money and watch the century turn 20

[Verse 3]
We all should, from the woods to the big city and the small hood
Everybody should be welcome to the ball if we all could
But we fall cause we brawl, yo it ain't all good
We need to play right, stay tight with ya air alight
Keep your game tight, no need to play trife
Get cheese from the daylight to the late night
And it's shouldn't take death to appreciate life
Before a lot parish, we got to cherish if Allah let us
Get proper nourish 'till the block flourish
In this metropolis, stay on top of this
You know what the prophet is, be prosperous

[Verse 5]
Now we networking
Respect the next person, it'll be less hurting
Or left lurkin, while we kept our dreads working
Connect set for certain, total networking
Last chance to advance and stash grands
If you have plans to have fam and mad land
Own shine, condone crime or hold 9s
I know what the problem is, killing our own kind
To my flame throwers, train sober, remain soldiers
Stay sane so these pretty dames can hold us
Terror terrain rollers and Range Rovers so the train goers
Claim your fame, maintain, till your game's over

Ghetto alert, let's do whatever work to get rid of the curse
We went from 1st to America's worst
On this competitive turf, now let's inherit the earth
There's more prize for one another, and call shots
12:00 til the next ball drop
All year around plus they shuffle non stop
You think it's rough at the bottom, it's even rougher on top
My peeps gonna have to reach and turn for me
And everybody's side of the street'll be sunny
Ain't nothing funny, burn plenty and burn money
And earn money and watch the century turn 20
