So just knowing that people, um...
Compare me with every hot kid that come out and...
You know, the expressions people give me when I see 'em in the streets sometimes
You know, people be looking at me like I'm a martian
Like, "Yo, it's the god", you know'm'sayin'
But that alone, man, keep me lovin' this, man, lovin' this
