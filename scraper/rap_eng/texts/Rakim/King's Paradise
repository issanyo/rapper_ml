[Verse 1]
Welcome to Harlem, the home of innovating
Legacies, stories of Gods killing Satan
Where they honor Harlem's father Philip Payton
The renaissance in the making
Ellington, Garvey, Joe Louis, Lena Horne
Malcolm, Maya, Louis Armstrong
But now crime is the new crave, so it's a new crusade
So salute to Luke Cage
Fight for the cause, all the way to the top Rivalry wars, life can be lost
No time for remorse
Forward, always for Pop, until the crown is rightfully yours
But success brings sacrifice
And knowing what's at stake
The pressure could crack a pipe
But everything has a price
But you pay with your life in the King's Paradise

[Chrous]
The king (king)
The king (king)
The king (king)
The king's Luke Cage (king)
Paradise
The king (king)
The king (king)
The king (king)
The king (king)
The king

[Verse 2]
This story gets complicated
He got framed for a crime and incarcerated
Locked up, his alter ego builds
Experimented on, left him with superhero skills
Now everyday he gets twice as strong
Bulletproof skin, but his life is torn
The only lady he ever loved in his life is gone
Escaped prison, got to fight to right his wrong
No question
He gon' take on the whole hood in a hoodie
No weapons and no cape on
One by one and knock 'em out
Until Cottonmouth is forgot about
But success brings sacrifice
And if you thinking it's a piece of cake, you can have a slice
It's like gambling with a pair of dice
But you pay with your life in the King's Paradise

[Chorus]
The king (king)
The king (king)
The king (king)
The king's Luke Cage (king)
Superhero skills
The king
