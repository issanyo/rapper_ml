[Verse 1: Rakim]
I idolized my father
He taught me to survive the horror
Cause times is harder, the skies is darker
Look through the eyes of a snake, see inside the monster
To rise need divide and conquer
If it's all about money I don't respect your power, that's weak
They deprive and devour, they cowards if you ask me
Powers that be mistreat us, mislead us
Thinking eventually we gone bite the hand that feed us
We son 'em and try to keep all other from 'em
Novus ordo seclorum, E pluribus unum
New order of the ages, out of many: one
While the rest of us is conned out of pennies: none
I'm starving, it's problems if we ain't fed quickly
My breads use to be the ones taking heads with me
Jealousy, hate, lust and greed is spread quickly
Don't call me brother if you ain't breaking bread with me

[Hook: Shontelle]
Don't call me mother
Don't call me sister
Don't call me brother
Don't call me father

[Verse 2: DMX]
Don't call me brother, we ain't got the same mother
Or the same father you get down like the other
Don't speak on wisdom when you know you don't love her
Don't shake my hand when you wanna see me under
Don't talk slick behind my back
Don't walk like this when you act like that
What you trying to bark for when you let you a cat
Come to your hood like ''brrap, brrap, brrap''
Mess with the kid if you want to
Cause your mans and them to tell you
It'll be the last thing that you going through
You built like a scooter, I'm built like a Hummer
I was built like a tank; you don't want it, baby, nuh-uh
Stop playing with things that'll get you hurt
You a girl, you can't play in the dirt, you got a skirt
You don't know a damn thing about putting in the work
With your whole effing block something murked like irk

[Hook]
