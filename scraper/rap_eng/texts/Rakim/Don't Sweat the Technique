[Hook]
Don't sweat the technique
Don't sweat the technique

[Verse 1]
Let's trace the hits and check the file
Let see who bit to detect the style
I flip the script so they can't get foul
At least not now, it'll take a while
I change the pace to complete the beat
I drop the bass to MC's get weak
For every word they trace it's a scar they keep
Cause when I speak, they freak to sweat the technique
I made my debut in '86
With a melody and a President's mix
And now I stay on target and refuse to miss
And I still make hits with beats
Parties, clubs, in the cars and jeeps
My underground sound vibrates the streets
MC's wanna beef then I play for keeps
When they sweat the technique

[Hook]
Don't sweat the technique

[Verse 2]
They wanna know how many rhymes have I ripped and wrecked
But researchers never found all the pieces yet
Scientists try to solve the context
Philosophers are wondering what's next
Pieces are took to labs to observe them
They couldn't absorb them, they didn't deserve them
My ideas are only for the audience's ears
For my opponents, it might take years
Pencils and pens are swords
Letters put together from a key to chords
I'm also a sculpture, formed with structure
Because of my culture, I'm equipped to construct the
Technical styles that'll be full of technology
Complete sights and new heights after I get deep
You don't have to speak just seek
And peep the technique

[Hook]
Never sweat the technique

[Verse 3]
I speak indiscreet cause talk is cheap
Then I get deep in the beat then complete the
Poem's physique, never weak or obsolete
They never grow old, techniques become antiques
Better then something brand new cause it's real
And in a while the styleâ€™ll have much more value
Classical, too intelligent to be radical
Masterful, never irrelevant, mathematical
Here's some soothing souvenirs for all the years
You fought and sought, the thoughts and ideas
It's cool when you freak to the beat
But don't sweat the technique

[Hook]
Never sweat the technique
Don't sweat the technique
Don't sweat the technique
