[Intro]
Yeah
It's the paragraph ambassador
The wild style fashioner
It's the god Rakim, the master
Feel this

[Verse 1]
This is that lost abstract off the rack kind of a track
You forced to rap, remember that? It's that
You know where I'm at, there go the gat
Pass me a bat, the kill-or-be-killed kind of attack
Steamin' the sack, speedin' navigatin' the map
Negotiating with a chick, she got her head on your lap
Ya hand on your gat premeditated plan of attack
With two of your most deadliest mens in the back
Comb the block, stop in the zone that's hot
Get out like you own the spot, home or not
It's that no mood to play, move out the my way
Yo, I been whistlin' this tune from throughout the day
Hey, yo, this is that ol' y'all niggas don't wanna battle
Turn it up loud make the whole block rattle
Boom boom- this one is gettin' crazy hot
Boom boom- make you bust another shot from the Glock

[Hook]
Explain the feeling you get when you hear a smash hit
When the track hit, it's classic, yeah, that's it
For the ladies this is the hatrick, with the back lit
For the minute get pornographic with that chick
Life'strap click, stack tips with a fat whip
Illest one of Ra's tactics, now that's sick
Similar to the rush casket with the with a gas bin
In other words, ayo, this is that shit

[Verse 2]
Here we come now, turntable spin like a merry-go-round
Never slow down, depending on how good your stereo sounds
Set it, up in the hood where we go surround
Tearin' through towns, turn 'em into burial grounds
This is the track that made Theodore wanna scratch
The track that caused the first kid to spin on his back
And then we saw, kids spray-painting the wall
While some of y'all was waitin' for war breakin' the law
It's no antidote it's what you can't provoke
So just relax with your girls or your mans and smoke
And take a real hit, soon as it bang you feel quick
It's real thick, this is that ol' real shit
This is the description of designs for you to listen to
Reminiscin' the times and nothin' in particular
Keep you goin' just like a whole pot of coffee
Have you and your shorty doin' 80 in a 40

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
You know what this is, yeah kid, give up your riches
Vicious, visions is not for motion pictures
Unstoppable, rollin' witcha sickest clique of niggas
Or witcha missus, gettin tropical kisses
Makin' faces, anticipatin' places her tongue hits
Suck her neck or just peck, better to funk it
The EP is in effect from dusk to sunset
She want a rim shot all over her drum set
Jump the bed rubbin' your head- it's rough sex
50 ways to keep a love wet
Down and up the steps with crazy positions left till she upset
"Damn, baby, you ain't come yet?"
Hell, no- doomstick big as a elbow
Gel soft, well blow, give him a minute, he'll grow
And all you gotta do is play the track again
I'm ready and revived, baby, back again

[Hook]
