She makes me wanna die
Follow where Mary goes
Cherish the things she knows
Says if I change my stride

Then I'll fly
She makes me wanna die
And change my stride
Then I'll fly

Look to the sun
See me in psychic pollution
Walking on the moon
And how could you dare?

Who do you think you are?
You're insignificant
A small piece, an ism
No more, no less

You try to learn the universe
And can't even converse in universe
You know it's ironic
Smoking hydroponic

She makes me wanna die
And change my stride
Then I'll fly

She makes me wanna die
Follow where Mary goes
Cherish the things she knows
Says if I change my stride

Then I'll fly
And change my stride
Then I'll fly

Look to the sun
See me in psychic pollution
Walking on the moon
And how could you dare?

Who do you think you are?
You're insignificant
A small piece, a ism
No more, no less

You try to learn the universe
And can't even converse in universe
You know
