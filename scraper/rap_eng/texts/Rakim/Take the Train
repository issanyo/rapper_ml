Rakim:
Calling all Rugrats (3x)
Please come in, Rugrats

Take it to the maximum
Take it to the max (8x)

Rakim:
All in together let's make a game
We can all win if we play the same
Whoever gets caught
Got to take the blame
We gon' take the train, take the train

Take it to the maximum (3x)
Rakim: Take it to the maximum

Rakim:
The train's been highjacked on track
And never come back
The express, the last stop is where the fun's at
I got my friends
A car full of hostages
To the destination
They'll be lots of kids
Enough said
Take it full steam ahead

I give extreme direction to the team of fed
We ain't a breeze
Once we hit top speed they gonna panic
But it's aerodynamic
Scream across the planet

Engines go against a airforce wind
Adrenaline
Make sure the trail of force won't end
The third rail prevails
We don't pretend to spin
Next question is when will the fun begin

What will we get there
Double the kicks
Hurry up
Because we can get in trouble for this
Speeding the Rugrats and them we have to come
Take it to the maximum

All in together lets make a game
We can all win if we play the same
Whoever gets caught got to take the blame
We gon' take the train, take the train

Take it to the maximum (3x)
Come On
Rakim: Take it to the maximum (2x)

Rakim:
Keep it moving
Is this the fastest this thing can go? (No)
Did we lose them?
Speed it up
We're going too slow
Where's the turbo button at? (Right here
I'ma push it)
Anymore juice that can boost the blow

Stand back give me that
I'ma play a game
Let's see who can gain on the runaway train
Everything is real
So I know I'll win
While you wish you could
I know I can

It's action pack
I was meant for this
High energy and adventurous
Look around
We're going faster than the speed of sound
Anymore faster and we'll leave the ground

Day designed
Outlined the curve
We zig-and-zag till we start to swerve
Speeding the Rugrats and them we have to come
Take it to the maximum

All in together lets make a game
We can all win if we play the same
Whoever gets caught got to take the blame
We gon' take the train, take the train

Take it to the maximum (3x)
Rakim: Take it to the maximum (2x)

Rakim:
Yo, Yo, take it to the maximum, yaknahmean?
And right now I want to give a major shout out to my little peoples
To Otis, Arlo, Gabby, Little Jamie, Jerdy, Jay, Justin, Jared

Danny Saber:

Rakim:
