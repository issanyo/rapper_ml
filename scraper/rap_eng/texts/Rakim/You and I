Chorus (Samuel Christian):

You and I will always be together
Peace or war, no matter the weather
Me and you like birds of a feather
Til the wind blows us away
We stand talk while they fall together
None left, I formation like the letter
Model and the shelter it's built for whatever
Til the wind blows us away

From the beginning it felt like we been in love
We took a chance knowing how slim it was
The world is ours now let's split it up
And you know how short life is let's big it up
Let's get fitted up, get it in and live it up
Dinner plus the cinema then lets hit the club
Posting up like both of us is spending ones
Cause we ain't get it if it didn't come in him and hers
Chemistry together just like a recipe
Or destiny we was meant to be together
Don't worry about me going left or doing you wrong
We right for each other it's a beautiful bond
We hug and touch, we love and lust
We last through the bashes, we cuss and fuss
Until we trust the love it's just for us
Until its ashes to ashes and dust to dust

Chorus

In each others arms it's like heroin love
That dope fiend forever in love
But it's better than drugs
It's heavy on the heart it's still a risk
But we never fall apart we was built for this
Nothing that we can't sort out, it's brought up
And thought out, erase all doubt go hard and all out
You and my fam fall out most of your family can't stand me
We can't let that cross out our family plans, can we?
We won't get no love from it
Let's just keep it one hunnid 'til we one hunnid
Stack grands 'til we grand-parents
Whatever work but let's hope for the best and expect the worst
Cause we'll have good and bad times together
But the bad will make the good times that much better
So let's absolve it 'til we sprawled out in coffins
And 2012 if the world fall out the orbit

Chorus

We go together like criminals and crime
Instrumentals and rhymes
Clothes and trends, like real G's and dimes
Stone gems and shine, real cream and pies
Chrome rims and rides, like ill teams and grinds
Like identical designs the pinnacle to rise
Like flows and ants, like skill dreams and drive
Home in France like a little trees and vibes
Close as kin or like heels, jeans and thighs
Since I was rocking Giseles you was hotter than hell
Now it's me and you like Barack and Michelle
Denzel and Pauletta prevail when all weather
Stand tall while they fail and fall together
The pleasure and the pain, the pressure and the hate
Through whatever we together like forever and a day
Checks and dollar signs the love for paper
Better yet like father time and mother nature

Chorus

I told you from the rip
We gone do what we do, you know what I mean?
It's me and you, you and I
It's the G-O-D
