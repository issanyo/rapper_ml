[Intro: Tiger JK]
Drunken Tiger the Monster Pit
하나 둘 셋

[Hook: Tiger JK]
Bam bam bababa bam (발라버려)
Bam bam bababa bam (발라버려)
Bam bam bababa bam (발라버려)
Bam bam bababa bam (발라버려)
All my drunkens in the front, make ya feet stomp
Drunkens in the back, get ready to react
Drunkens in the front, make ya feet stomp
Drunkens in the back, get ready to react

[Verse 1: Rakka]
Mom's born in Seoul, pop's born with soul
Pains with cops blow pistols like whistles
Crazy jiujitsu but a hapkido flow
You only throwin' hands playin' kawi-bawi-bo
The crowd goes wild, scopin' me ride by slow
Open my mouth wide, now let the spotlight glow
From Cali, I keep a license for on the cropside grow
Even google Japawan can't stop my show
Golden goal, top celebrity TMC
Cross the line, you're in jeopardy DMC
Excalibur, introduce you to my rhyme sword
Devine lord, back to b-boys like i'm scraw
Dilated primetime the pure, for sure
It's rockin', The world's sick, here comes the cure
Seem so true, spit holy water the bless the good shepherd
You should come follow the best

[Hook 1]

[Verse 2: Roscoe Umali]
It's the millenium edition, Roscoe Umali come through
And wack rappers start trembling in their Timbalands
It's not just a metaphors and synonyms
It's how I symbol 'em, I'm gettin' them independent percentages
Spendin' the Benjamins, eatin' venison with my friends and 'em
Swirmin' them international women, it's like it's Wimbledon
Even at my bare minimum, I'm still killin' 'em
That's why all the DT fans are still feelin' 'em
Cause line after line, it's so perfectly designed
Live and direct, one time for your mind
Big game, like James worthy in his prime
I'm the first rapper that's really worthy of his shine
And it's early but it's time for the passing of the torch
I'm the reason why your wifey keeps asking for divorce
Decisions, decisions, the Aston or the Porsche
Got me kushed out, i'll have you start dancing on the porch

[Hook 1 + Hook 2]

[Verse 3: Tasha]
Yo, It's the jumpoff, bitches man up or step the fuck off
Rumble in the jungle, drunken we bout the set it off
Rude gal with a mouth like a trucker
Call me stuckup, you know I don't give a blocka
Cause my flow's like wow, I got more soul
Bitches talk shit cause my pocket stays swoll
And I keeps it dirty like the Han-Gang river
Flip ye mode when I bust rhymes like my name Rah Digga
And, Ha ha ha ha, I know your crew can't believe it
Rakim, Rakaa, Roscoe and they killin' it
Tiger J with Lady T, I know you're feelin' it
Ha ha ha ha, Ha ha ha ha

[Tiger JK]
Oh baby, I like it raaaaaaaaaaaw
Yeah, ODT!

[Verse 4: Tiger JK]
I exercise the exorcism mrs trumble OVP
Throw up and rock the ol' dirty soul under the morning tree
Passed the incarnation of drunken poetry
Assimily just feelin' fuck the authority
I'm hotter than hell, them devils deported me
I'm drunk, I don't give a fuck, stitch you with my liquid
If you die come I started and i'm browl to fucking dead
But I'm not a fighter, I'm a lover
I say "nooo" to war my brother
And I'm down with your brick, go ask your mother
I said shimmy shimmy ya shimmy shimmy shimmy yeah
Give me the microphone and motherfuckers OJ

[Tiger JK]
Yeah, it's the ressurection
The real MC's, the job we're waiting for

[Rakka]
Ahh, you already know, the GOD MC
What up to the DT movement
Drunken tiger, this is New York to the ROK

[Hook 2]

[Verse 5: Rakim]
Still on my one-two about respect
Til I get what I'm out to get
Take chicks to G-Bay, they out to dress (I like that)
Then I'm out to death, any jungle east, north, south or west
They crit when I come through about the rep
The matrix, the one who the crowd select
Make hits, brung jewels that style perfects
Great swift like the Hangul alphabet
The chosen career, call me king Sejong
By career reign long fake king salom
Cause the pains stay on, and my scene stay warm
I keep it one hunnit, do my thing stay strong
What a artist is, I inspire empire
I call the choir like an arsonist
Got dem jumping higher and response to this
Rakim, Drunken Tiger, monsterous

[Hook 1 + Hook 2]

[Tiger JK]
Seoul to NY to LA (Monster Pit)
All around the world (Y'all response to this)
Real hip hop
