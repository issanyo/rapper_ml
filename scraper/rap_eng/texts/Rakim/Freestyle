Lyrics make me a menace
When it's in a sentence then it's finished
More pure than raw, much more above the law
I don't go on tour, I go to war
Stompin' COMP performance that flaunt a similar style
Raps attack 91 rap exile
Cause every word I said'll be deadly
An MC murderer, science is steadily
Giving me new ways and methods
Melodies and medleys, weapons for records
Tactics lethal, perhaps it's illegal
Scorching, I'm torching cause that's how we do
Set your entire empire on fire
So give me a mic without a wire
Cause every dose is highly explosive
Mr. Dynamite, the man with most of
The blueprints and masterplans, the potential
Data process stored in the mental
Then I get physical and hit you with another hit
The brother's it, and nothing's equivalent
