I kick a hole in the speaker, pull the plug, then I jet

Once upon a rhyme, the time late 60s, dark age of history
Murders and mysteries, the future was misty
Needles were shot down and crime was risky
Yo check this party and stick with me
Race brutality because of my nationality
And this is what they call reality
From that state of mind and at that date and time
I was born inclined and waiting to shine
Once upon a rhyme

Once upon a time not long ago
Once upon a time not long ago

The beginning, the scenery sets in New York
With times are hard and streets ain't easy to walk
Crimes is underrated, neighborhoods overpopulated
Competition gets complicated, some can't take it
My place of rest in the city that never sleeps
To compete it gets deep I learn to play for keeps
And hawk the sidewalk, dominate the court
I'm nice in all sports, was taught with high thoughts
Then came an Africans and knew where it was at
Spreadin' across the map with no time flat
They said this kid name Herc started spinning records back
Had to look into that then get it down pat
First I do research it's gonna take time
Me and my crew is hittin' all the parties we could find
Waitin' for the day where I could go for mine
But later dates await down the line
Once upon a rhyme

Once upon a time not long ago
Once upon a time not long ago

Many shall come but only few get the plot off the top
You gotta be hip to hop and get visual
With musical forms, lyrical pictures from city slickers
Beats getting blast by ass kickers
It was the pioneers with all kinda ideas
Trade will shift to higher gears over the years
Some get left in the dust by the thrust
If rhymes won't bust with a mic full of rust
DJs, get your fingers musically amputated
You can't touch a jam if the next man slayed it
Battle at the center, I'm too young too enter
We cool outside, even in the winter
We have a good time with the people on line
And party time seem like the neighborhood shine
But I get vexed when I can't get mine
But later dates await down the line
Once upon a rhyme

Once upon a time not long ago
Once upon a time not long ago

I kick a hole in the speaker, pull the plug, then I jet
I kick a hole in the speaker, pull the plug, then I jet

Through the times my rhymes got longer
Mind got stronger, wonder I'd ever be a performer
My blood starts to boil I could heat up the party for you
Girls wanna rub me and my mic down with oil
Rappers started coming out the woodwork
A neighborhood expert, we ready for trouble and stay alert
Days got close til my debut got recruited to a crew
Now I could do the things I always wanted to
Code red I inherited, many ways to say the unsaid
Born with three 7's in my head
Blessed it, destined to be one of the best and
Anything I find interesting yeah no question
A swift kid I get lifted by the mind
Gifted skills exist to be on my prime
Combined with all kinds of designs which is mine
Its showtimes await down the line
Once upon a rhyme

Once upon a time not long ago
Once upon a time not long ago
