[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
I ain't no joke I used to let the mic smoke
Now I'm like Mike Jordan with the flow
Identify with a scientific scope
Scope over the rifle
Fragments and potholes
Got rappers selling surveillance behind black tint in the parking lot at Roscoes
Making the change lift straight jack move
Pack 2 some mechanic
Pull it out you panic, flow nuts like cashews
Shift to Cancun, even though I’m Compton
Like Raider Caps and Corduroy house shoes
I be the illest witness the lyrical drug dealin’
When I distribute the word these rappers get hard feelings
No remorse sucka MC’s throw fits cause I carry the torch without Olympics
Kill all friendships my enemies
Go against the God MC? penalty crucifixion
So nice wish you had 3 ear drums to listen
Damn right I be the don Corleone of rap songs whether on the east cost or back home
We clap chrome like magnetic monkey wrenches
Used to hop fences
Now we hop on top of bad bitches pass em to the homies like basketball assists
West Coast Vengeance, East Coast Revenue something new like
Pac in Versace lenses Big in the Khaki Suit
Best of both worlds when I step in the booth
Suicidal thugs from them him her and you
I kick away the chair you hang from the noose
Shoutout to sidegun and Papoose, Kunta Kinte and ?
Bringing it back to the roots, you understand

[Jay Rock]
Yeah yeah yeah from Cali to N.Y
You already know lets get it in
(I ain’t no joke)

[Verse 2: Jay Rock]
Yeah yeah yeah from Cali to N.Y
You already know lets get it in
(I ain’t no joke)
Like Mike Tyson in his prime, knocking out rappers with every line
Won't attest how I come back with a forty-five
Like MJ, sucker MC’s expire
LA Nigga not to be fucked with, Thug Quick
Guns tucked nigga we buck shit
We do pop take off your rooftop
On the rooftop with choppas infrared dot ya
One shot no doctors, just yellow tape and white sheets
Buck chrome tell em why
Living like felipe though you lay on our paper
Yo life we repo play for keeps, no need for peace talk
Catch contact whenever the weed spark
Yeah its chronic in whatever we smoke
Got signed but I’m still in the hood like a brick of blow
Hit the club made my pick n’ roll this should give em dough
Jay Rock used to be in them drug spots
Now I rap for the dough all for the Mula, hoo-ha
Sucker MC’s no threat, i could run laps around each one no sweat
They’d all be scared of me, no one ahead of me
Nailed to the throne, I’m a project celebrity
These niggas ain’t all that they said they’d be
Nothing but images raping the youth stealing their benjamins
Under the dirt is where we sending them
New coupe speed off color be cinnamon
Nike Cortez’s, and Pendletons
LA style hop out slide doors on a minivan
Its like that spray the whole block if we miss one spot, what we gotta do

[Kendrick]
Come right back
I play the passenger
Dumb shot then pour gas on ya
Acting like Nelson as I laugh at ya

[Jay Rock]
The young boy Casper ya
Ya soul rise out the casket bruh
New rap game lazarus, Top Dawg ENT Soliders ain’t nothing after us
