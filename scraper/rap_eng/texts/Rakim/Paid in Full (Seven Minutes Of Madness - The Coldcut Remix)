[Intro]
This is a journey into sound

This is a journey into sound
A journey which along the way will bring to you
New color, new dimension, new value

When all is ready, I throw this switch
Pump up the volume, Pump up the volume
Pump that bass

[Bridge: Ofra Haza]
Im nin'alu
Daltei n'divim
(Please Eff, would you mind saying that again?)
Im nin'alu
Daltei n'divim
(You make me feel so good)

(We interrupt this broadcast to bring you a special news bulletin from our on the spot task force)
(Oh my gosh)
(The music just turns me on)

(He’s a sweet soul brother)

[Coldcut scratches lead in 2x]
Thinking of a master plan
Def with record, def with the record

[Verse 1: Rakim]
Thinking of a master plan
‘Cause ain't nothing but sweat inside my hand
So I dig into my pocket, all my money is spent
So I dig deeper, but still coming up with lint
So I...start my mission, leave my residence
Thinking, "How could I get some dead presidents?"
I need money; I used to be a stick-up kid
So I think of all the devious things I did

[Coldcut scratches interlude 2x]
I used to roll up…roll up…roll up

I used to roll up, this is a hold up, ain't nothing funny
Stop smiling, be still, don't nutin’ move but the money
But now I learned to earn ‘cause I'm righteous
I feel great; so maybe I might just
Search for a 9 to 5, if I strive
Then maybe I'll stay alive
So I walk up the street whistling this
Feeling out of place ‘cause, man do I miss
A pen and a paper, a stereo, a tape of
Me and Eric B, and a nice big plate of
Fish, which is my favorite dish
But without no money it's still a wish
‘Cause I don't like to dream about getting paid
So I dig into the books of the rhymes that I made
So now to test to see if I got pull
Hit the studio, ‘cause I'm paid in full

[Sample: James Brown]
One…two…three…Uhh
One…two…three…Uhh

(By George...Even London grooves)
(Pump up the volume, Pump up the volume)
(Pump that bass)

[Bridge: Ofra Haza]
Im nin'alu
Daltei n'divim
Daltei marom
Lo nin'alu
El Chai, mareimawm

(Back in the club, how you kids used to laugh at that song)

[Outro: Eric B. & Rakim]
Check this out
Yo, you go to your girl house and I’ll go to mine
‘Cause my girl is definitely mad cause it took us to long to do this album
Yo, I hear what you saying so let’s just pump the music up…
And count our money
Yo well check this out, Yo Eli
Turn the bass down and just let the beat keep on rocking
And we outta here

Pump up the volume, Pump up the volume
(Wait a minute; you better talk to my mother)

[Bridge: Ofra Haza]
Im nin'alu
Daltei n'divim (Ok…alright)
Daltei marom
Lo nin'alu
El Chai, mareimawm (Ok…alright)

[Ending: Eric B. & Rakim]
Yo, what happened to peace?
Peace

(One…two…three…four)

Def with the record
Def with the record, Def with the record
(It’s so fresh)
(Goodnight kids)

(Was it good enough for you?)
