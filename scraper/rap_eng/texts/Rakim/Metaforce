[Verse 1: Rakim]
Hey yo, it’s something about the evening air in the summertime
Certain sounds that I fiend to hear, I wanna rhyme
My inner vision causes my metabolism to climb
And then I splatter my wisdom and the design
I leave time suspended and break gravity’s laws
Metaforce to the world ain’t spinning no more
And from there I put sounds to hear, in the autumn air
Sorta rare, something y’all will compare to Baudelaire

[Chorus: Rakim & Art of Noise]
The Art of Noise (Check it out y’all)
The Art of Noise (Aerodynamic in the evening air)
The Art of Noise (Make me aerodynamic in the evening air)

[Verse 2: Rakim]
Rakim then commits to intricate
Deep in a lady as a man can get into it
And keep you wet until the sweat began to drip
And then the instruments is intimate
Ideas I suggest will caress your ear
Bass kicks and hi hats molest the snare
Sounds as orgasmic with the melodies in there
Make me aerodynamic in the evening air

[Chorus: Rakim & Art of Noise]
Aerodynamic in the evening air
Make me aerodynamic in the evening air
Aerodynamic in the evening air
Got to be right here to inhale the evening air

[Bridge: Rakim and John Hurt]
Surrounded by flowers
The evening air in the summertime
Surrounded by flowers

[Verse 3: Rakim]
What, what, what, what
Hey yo, it’s something about the evening air in the summertime
Certain sounds that I fiend to hear, I wanna rhyme
Splatter my wisdom and the design
I leave time suspended and break gravity’s laws
Metaforce to the world ain’t spinning no more
Sorta rare, something y’all will compare to Baudelaire

The Art of Noise
Make me aerodynamic in the evening air

Aerodynamic in the evening air
The Art of Noise

(This is a thought, this is a metaphor)

[Outro: Rakim]
Yeah, Rakim Allah, Art of Noise
