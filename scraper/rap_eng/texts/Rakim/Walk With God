Walk With God
C'mon
Walk With Me


Verse 1: (Op1)
We gotta, walk with God till the top of the mornin
Climbing all the way up the hill to meet Lauren
It's raining, it's pourin
God sent me a warning
Imma keep clean till 4 in the mornin
These new school think they're to Ra for Kim
When God is in my presents I do it all for him, ten
All my lines are all for him
I mean, I'm all for the sin
Talking again
Follow-min
Swallowing
Heart of a King
I have the soul of a black and a jew
So I'm spiritual, lyrical
Passion and fumes
Too many years I've been acting confused
Really what ask me to choose
I spit 7 every line unplugged, (lauren)
Rakim, true shine one love
One love, one love, one love
One love

(Chorus:)
I do it all for him   (4x)
(my God)  (4x)

Walk With God (2x)
I want you to Walk With God (2x)
C'mon and Walk with God  (2x)
