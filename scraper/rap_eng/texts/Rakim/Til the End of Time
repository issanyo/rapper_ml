[Intro]

[Chorus]

[Verse 1]
Yes I know times have changed
I'll be straight up with you
It's so hard to explain why I feel the way I do
For you
We've had ups and downs
Long as love's still around yeah
We can make it last forever
If we're not too proud to say
I love you

[Chorus]
(Darling)
I love you
(I love you)
Forever
(Forever)
You make my dreams come true
(Dreams come true)
You know
(You know)
And I know
(And I know)
We'll be together
(Together)
Until the end of time
(Until the end of time)

[Verse 2]
It's so hard for a man
In this world full of trials
Tell me how can I get
All the things that I want
That I need
If we both believe
We can accomplish anything
Just think of all we could achieve
'cause I'll be yours and you'll be mine
Until the end of time

[Chorus]
(Darling)
(I love you)
(Forever)
Forever
(Dreams come true)
You make my dreams come true
(You know)
(And I know)
I know
(Together)
Until the end of time
(Until the end of time)

You make my dreams come true
(Dreams come true)

We'll be together
(Together)
Until the end of time
(Until the end of time)

Come on

Do it like this
Do it like this
Do it like this
Do it like this
