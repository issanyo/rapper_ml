Verse one's about a kid who didn't like the way the Earth spun
He said it's cursed; so he went and got his first gun
He turned savage, took matters in his own hands
He said "I'm grown, nothing matters; I'm my own man;
Because we don't know how to live but we know how to die
The game of life and no one'll make it out alive"
So I'mma stay in heavy arm and I'mma keep a gun
And I'mma beg for dear life when the reaper come
Yo, he's a beast, everybody in the streets fear him
Thugs won't cross him, cops won't go near him
Nothing could scare him,  it's time to try and get rich
He robbed his suppliers plus he gets hired for hits
Now the mice want his bread, it's the price on his head
And everybody that he didn't like want him dead
I guess he knew the same streets you rep on
Will be the same streets you meet your death on

I used to be a stick-up kid
So I think of all the devious things I did

Verse two is how a little dude flipped, and grew too quick
He did some rude shit and got his hands on two bricks
Bought the new fifth, with the extra two clips
Put together two cliques and took over two strips
Dude glued chips, new kicks and new whips
Knew tricks, got two kids by two chicks
But he blew too quick, they said he shoot too quick
Too slick, but the cops are deep, but he got beef
He said "I gotta hit the block for my needs"
But I'mma leave the block 'cuz this hot cop is watching the streets
Made a couple stops at the spot and bought trees
He copped a new uptown patent leather Dashik
Too sick, now let me hit the hood
To stop by and make sure the kids are good
That's when the man ran up on him put the gat in his face
Said "Remember me from back in the day?"

[Hook]
