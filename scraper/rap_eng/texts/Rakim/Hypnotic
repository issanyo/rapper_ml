The rhymes is hypnotic
Every rhyme is hypnotic

[Verse 1: Rakim]

Now bust a mental, physical fitness
Here's descriptions, get with this and witness
Take a good look so you'll know what the prescription is
Is it a lyricist or a hypnotist?
I swing on the mic until the crowd's unconscious
React and reflex and now you're response is
"Yeah, like this here," "Yeah, something severe,"
"The R is here, aww yeah"
For those that don't participate, refuse to break
Hallucinate and rehab couldn't rehabilitate
Brain cells serve and slam, more germs saw a chance
To a flame pre-heated when I say 'em
Filled with smoke when I wrote it
Potent, hear ya get leery, weary when quotin'
Rakim invents something intense
Get you high, sucking on stems and stimulants
More exotic than the chief street product
Too fat for Castle, too large for a pocket
Overload the brain if you need it I got it
Pound your throats and every grain's hypnotic

[Verse 2: Rakim]

Tempo's shifting, feel the urge to splurge
That's when I start to emerge
Go ahead, pump weights, girls and give me a massage
Because you're never too large to get squashed
Here's the hook, look, they couldn't wait
I accelerate while they took the bait
Then I unhook 'em and let 'em fiend for the rest of them
Cause it's better than Mescaline
MCs are O.D.ing, he couldn't cope
Nope, see him, looks like he had a mic full of opium
And I don't wanna have to get sarcastic
Thoughts and soft minds go far past it
And I don't sniff no 'caine to get raw
I don't stress my brain, it ain't pure
I smoke beats and my product's the topic
Every rhyme is hypnotic
