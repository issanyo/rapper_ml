Ak'Sent
(Make 'em clap ta this)
(Make 'em clap ta this)

[Verse 1: Ak'Sent]
Here is Ak'Sent and Paula
Sitting side ways in a six-foot candy-painted pole, uh
I'm a robber 'cause I clap raps like a 45 revolver
Called her, told her it's like nova, nova down on his deck
Keep shining on my neck, neck, Ak'Sent, I'm the best yet
So go rearrange your bestest
We the best kept secret from the west yes

[Verse 1: Paula DeAnda]
I'ma think of a little something
Make a playa wanna know about me
When you hear a thump thumpin'
Pump a pump pump
'Til it's hard to breathe
Ladies, shake the little something
'Cause you know, this is what the boys like the see
Then eyes
No, don't get it twisted
Baby, look but don't touch
No hands on me

[Pre-Chorus: Paula DeAnda]
If you like it, form a circle
So put the ladies in the middle and do like this
Said if you like it, form a circle
Low back
Give me some room, just do what I do, oh

[Chorus: Paula DeAnda]
Make 'em clap ta this (wanna watch you move)
Make 'em clap ta this (can you shake your thing?)
Make 'em clap ta this (you know what to do tonight)
So got them boys like, oh
Make 'em clap ta this, oh, oh
Make 'em clap ta this, oh, oh
Make 'em clap ta this, oh, oh (oh, oh, oh, oh)

[Verse 2: Paula DeAnda]
All of this staring at me
Licking your lips, trying to impress (wow)
Looking like you wanna touch me
(Don't trip) Get fresh and you will get checked
Ladies, they just put the jam on
When you hear it, you be talkin' about this much, shhh
Fellas, make some room now
And let the ladies get right to it

[Pre-Chorus: Paula DeAnda]
If you like it, form a circle
So put the ladies in the middle and do their thing
Said if you like it, form a circle
Move back
Give me some room, to do what I do, oh
If you like it, form a circle
So put the ladies in the middle and do their thing
Said if you like it, form a circle
Move back
Give me some room, to do what I do, oh

[Chorus: Paula DeAnda]
Make 'em clap ta this (wanna watch you move)
Make 'em clap ta this (can you shake your thing?)
Make 'em clap ta this (you know what to do tonight)
So got them boys like, oh
Make 'em clap ta this, oh, oh
Make 'em clap ta this, oh, oh
Make 'em clap ta this, oh, oh (oh, oh, oh, oh)
(Make 'em clap ta this)
When they watch you move
Make 'em clap ta this
When you shake your thing
Make 'em clap ta this
You know what to do tonight
Make 'em clap ta this
(oh, oh, oh, oh)
Make 'em clap ta this

[Verse 3: Aksent]
Baby, I'm so groovy, check how I move it
Gucc, covered  in Louis, Prada, and Gucci
Hottest shaking, you know it
Me and Paula, the lowest
My job is giving me glowing
The source of my rhyme, I own the source of mine
They keep me their ive mics, but I'd rather have dollar signs
See my girls, they get it poppin', hustlin'
Who makin' it happenin', make rap in the trap
Paula D.'s make 'em clappin'

[Chorus: Paula DeAnda]
Make 'em clap ta this (wanna watch you move)
Make 'em clap ta this (can you shake your thing?)
Make 'em clap ta this (you know what to do tonight)
So got them boys like oh
Make 'em clap ta this, oh, oh
Make 'em clap ta this, oh, oh
Make 'em clap ta this, oh, oh (oh, oh, oh, oh)
Make 'em clap ta this (wanna watch you move)
Make 'em clap ta this (can you shake your thing?)
Make 'em clap ta this (you know what to do tonight)
So got them boys like oh
Make 'em clap ta this, oh, oh
Make 'em clap ta this, oh, oh
Make 'em clap ta this, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Make 'em clap ta this
Make 'em clap ta this
Make 'em clap ta this
(Make 'em clap ta this)
