Ra came up with something wicked, dig it
You hear it in the crib and get evicted when I kick it
They'll make a duplicate of it and tell 'em how I flip it
Is it another masterpiece or is it?
Xeroxed, zero, no match, a ditto
A copy machine couldn't reprint my little
Fast [?] joy, case you're unsure
But my [?] has you thinkin' either or
But I'll always let you now what the outcome will be
So you can understand where I come from see
MCs interfere but they can't school me
I've seen your work G, it don't fool me

I said you don't fool me

But you don't fool me

I said you can't fool me

People always say, what they wanna do
Things they gotta do, but never get it done
Some front all the props about how many girls they got
But when it all boils down they get none
Yeah I know all they really gotta do is get a life
No future in frontin' I hope you see the light
Instead of trying to flip, you need to get a grip
Wake up and stop tryin' to sell dreams all night
Slow down and make sense, before you get paid
Or take up a new trade cuz it ain't' cool G
You say you're all that when you ain't half of that
Give me my ear back cause you don't fool me

I said you don't fool me

Cause you don't fool me

Hey yo, you can't fool me

That's how it be
