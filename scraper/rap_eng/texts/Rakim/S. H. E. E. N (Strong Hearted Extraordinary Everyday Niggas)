Intro:

Aye, My names Ezko
And im a strong hearted extraordinary everyday nigga
Im a Sheen Muh fucka
Yeah

Verse 1:

I figured id take it back to the pen and pad
And write these lyrics and raise some spirits and make some mad
And tell you how my life was crashin
Cuz of my passion
Imagine us moving from an apartment to a mansion
I have a dream
And I won't sleep till I make it happen
Won't cheat
And won't weep
In one week
Id be the main attraction
Your brains relaxing
My brains in action with great reactions
I feel like Joseph
How I beat mics to make these Jacksons
I started rapping when niggas didn't think it was cool
Back of the school
Smoking weed, flashing the jewels
Actin a fool
Yelling M.O.B
Now im honest when im on it
I vomit I O.D
Never been the type to see the hype
I take some shit and make it nice
Never been
Hesitant to trigger my element
Niggas is hating
Niggas is feminine
Precedent evidence, lyrics benevolent
Hatin on me though im just truly eminent
Hatin my raps and the manner im telling it
Lyrics as dope as the manner im selling it

Hook: Notorious BIG Sample

Verse 2: Im behind my bars till I die
Like the judge gave me life nigga
Thats right nigga
I'mma always paint the right picture
The right mixture to write verses that people quote
Evil jokes
Thats me describing the shit that people wrote
Ya bars' soap
You drop em and get fucked
Never been a dancer but I guarantee I get Bucks
A plus
Thank us, otherwise I know you mad as shit
Homer when I rap, I take the microphone and strangle it
Its nonstop
They sucking niggas like bomb pops
Sleeping on me
When your alarm clock is a bomb drop
I spit raps
They drop rhymes a little bit
I drop bombs that make Hiroshima feel like a little bitch
So pass the torch while I wait for Yoda to pass the force
I passed the course
Married to the game homie im passed divorce
I hear em now
Screaming in the crowd saying wow
Ezko's bout to kill it
He gon make us proud
And when the deeds done
My name will forever remain
Ever to reign
Part of your brain
Man my life will not be the same

Hook

On the microphone I make my art
I heard that was the place to start
Get in the studio make a new movie yo
Have em all listen im laying my heart
I take em apart
N figure out wat makes em tick
Makes em think
That all their favorite rappers are major sick
You got a better chance of beating the wheel of fortune
Than in my recordings
Cuz I blew the mind of the headless horseman
So get to recording
On the track im the black Jeff Gordon
Im Michael Jordan getting stoned like I fuck with gorgons
I feel like Norman
Bates pick a place
While I start the chase
Pick up ya pace
Or else you'll have to pick up ya face
N thats my message to rappers that think theyre competition
I'mma listen
Then attack you on
All your compositions
And my position missionary
Take you all to church
I never had a visionary that could really do some work
For what its worth
Im worth more than you've ever seen
I father you bastards then deny you like you Billie jean
