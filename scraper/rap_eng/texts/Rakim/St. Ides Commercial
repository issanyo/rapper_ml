Tonight's the night
Where's the happenin' time to get it on
My pockets are fat so I'm gone
Me and my posse, they can come through
Invited to a jam they said bring the crew
And a handful of rhymes and my own microphone
And tell 'em to leave the [censored] home
[?] they can't wait to see me, I'm getting greedy
Which is the place to be, G
Wall to wall on the floor having a ball
When I came in the door they said "Yes, yes y'all"
Cause I got a mic with a bass and the highs
Cause the God's in supply, I got the St. Ides
