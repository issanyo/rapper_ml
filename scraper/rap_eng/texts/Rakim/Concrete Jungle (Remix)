Verse 1:
No sun will shine in my day today
The high yellow moon, won't come out to play
I said darkness has covered my light, (oooh)
And has changed my day into night, (oooh)
Where is the love to be found (Where's this love to be found)
Will someone tell me because life sweet life must be somewhere to be found (Sweet life)
Instead of Concrete Jungle, (Jungle, oh, oh oh,)
Concrete Jungle, (Jungle)
Where the living is hard
Man you have to do your thing yeah. (Jungle)
Oh yeah

Scratches:
Come On

No chains around my feet but I'm not free
I know I am bound here in captivity
Ooohhhh
Never know
Never known happiness
Never known
Never known what sweet caress is
Well I'm always laughing like a clown (oh)
Still ill be laughin jus like a clown
Concrete Jungle (Jungle)
Illusions, Illusions (Concrete Jungle)
Concrete Jungle (Concrete Jungle)
Oh, no no no
Concrete Jungle

Rakim:
Yeah, Yeah, Yeah (come on)
In the lions den
You hear the cry of dying men
The lions in
Every puddle, Leviathan
You try and win go against the blind to win
It'll put the eye of the tiger in iron men
The heart beats like animals in dark street
Stalk to eat
In the jungle it's concrete
Instead of wood we use metal to draw heat
The habitats the hood
They single the god beats
The tribals in a deadly game of survival
Genocidal
Read you Koran and your Bible
When the merciful get merciless
We need to read Psalms 82 verse 6
Its real so make you sure you do real things
Females never forget your still queens
Feel it till you feel free with wings
And the male we ain't got to kill to be kings

Concrete Jungle (Jungle) (Come on now)
Concrete Jungle (Come on) (3x)
