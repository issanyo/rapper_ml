[Intro]
Yeah, word to rhyme
Ayo, turn the bass up a little bit, G
Yeah, yeah
(Rakim)
(Make 'em clap to this)
Now check it out
(Rakim)
(Make 'em clap to this)

[Verse 1]
I come again, fun-a begin when the drummer come in
Synonyms don't wanna end, Rakim's gonna win
Always seem to come out at the right time with the right rhymes
Smooth in the day it sound rough at night time
Just an echo, in every ghetto, meadow and valley
Side street and alley, from New York to Cali
I been seen in every state and between on stage
They scream every phrase I leave the city in a rage
It's on to the next one to bless one, that's my procedure
Leave ya in a deeper mind state than anesthesia
Ya catch a seizure if you try to stop the great
When I operate, just let the crowd please ya, drop the weight
Just want us in gear, from everyone from here to there
Ideas that ya hear, severe to the ear
Nevertheless, I provide a world wide request
And manifest, and this is from the East to the West

[Hook]
From New York to Cali (to Cali, to Cali)
Coast to coast, I been rippin' coliseums and clubs
From New York to Cali (to Cali, to Cali)
Rhymin' over dubs for thugs, girls blow me kisses and throw me hugs
From New York to Cali (to Cali, to Cali)
Coast to coast, I been rippin' coliseums and clubs
From New York to Cali (to Cali, to Cali)
Rhymin' over dubs for thugs, girls blow me kisses and throw me hugs

[Verse 2]
Musical rise, I memorize in my mental enterprise
Then improvise live with my supplies
You know the quota, fashional design the shine
The international kind start the rhyme time to motor
Irreversible format, adapt to wherever ya livin' at
From all four corners of the mat
Whenever they play it, it gets interpretated, Hip-Hop related
Already dedicated keep it heavy populated
Attract everybody that could rock
Do a block party, make it look like Woodstock, yeah
Rakim Allah, nothing similar to my seminar
They travel never far plus that's where the women are
I like to ask them, "What's the best time to hear me rhyme?"
Nevertheless I provide a worldwide request and manifest
And this is from the East to the West

[Hook]
From New York to Cali (to Cali, to Cali)
Coast to coast, I been rippin' coliseums and clubs
From New York to Cali (to Cali, to Cali)
Rhymin' over dubs for thugs, girls blow me kisses and throw me hugs
From New York to Cali (to Cali, to Cali)
Coast to coast, I been rippin' coliseums and clubs
From New York to Cali (to Cali, to Cali)
Rhymin' over dubs for thugs, girls blow me kisses and throw me hugs

[Verse 3]
Coast to coast, I been rippin' coliseums and clubs
Rhymin' over dubs for thugs, girls blow me kisses and throw me hugs
A sporadic concert on stage
I got classics (Soul), which means my smash hits won't age
And sing along, I bring a song I be swinging long
We can do a thing 'til dawn, I came to bring it on on tour
Stoppin' all the records stores across the nation
Flow at the radio station to show appreciation
Retreats for the streets, peace for the jeeps
And reach incredible feats to get deep for my peeps
Props for the unorthodox style I got
They couldn't wait for me to drop move stock for the block
Strong kick cassette decks, walkmen headsets
I come off, fly concepts is high tech
My first display is to converse with the days
And slam, that's why the man first jam still play
So tell the neighborhoods I got the goods again
It's Rakim, then again that's how it should have been
Nevertheless I provide a worldwide request and manifest
And this is from the East to the West

[Hook]
From New York to Cali (to Cali, to Cali)
Coast to coast, I been rippin' coliseums and clubs
From New York to Cali (to Cali, to Cali)
Rhymin' over dubs for thugs, girls blow me kisses and throw me hugs
From New York to Cali (to Cali, to Cali)
Coast to coast, I been rippin' coliseums and clubs
From New York to Cali (to Cali, to Cali)
Rhymin' over dubs for thugs, girls blow me kisses and throw me hugs

[Outro]
Back in the Nine to Five, you know what I'm sayin'?
Comin' with the butters, you know what I'm sayin'?
It's Rakim Allah, nothin' sayin' but the year
Coast to coast, I been rippin' coliseums and clubs
Rhymin' over dubs for thugs, girls blow me kisses and throw me hugs
Coast to coast, I been rippin' coliseums and clubs
