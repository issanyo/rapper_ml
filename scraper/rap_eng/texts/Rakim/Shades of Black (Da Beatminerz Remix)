Yo this is a test to see if you know what time it is, what time it was and what time it's gonna be
It's Rakim Allah
Ya know what I'm sayin'
And this how we get down
Representin'
Check it out
For the Black Panthers
It's gonna get set like this

(Verse 1)
We're dealing with some devious days
But believe me it's ways
Of posing tact for those that act mischievous pays
Foes in town is bound to hold you down
Physically your baddest when you hold your ground
And let loose the hounds
And double barrel scatters the thunder
When I stand they want me to be under
See the government wanna remove the G and be over me
Make more men and still live life free
And leave me for sorrow
Not promised tomorrow
A job, a house, or a chance to show what I know
I'm out to crusade, all I got is the streets
Cuz I've been waitin' for opportunity to knock for weeks
If he come, tell him I went to organize
And enterprise unity in the community and rise
That means take it back
Whoever's against that, then we attack
With various shades of black

Wisdom be leakin' out my grapefruit, troop
End like Leviathan, it's deep; well, let me try again

Wisdom be leakin' out my grapefruit, troop
End like Leviathan, it's deep; well, let me try again

Wisdom be leakin' out my grapefruit, troop
End like Leviathan, it's deep; well, let me try again

Wisdom be leakin' out my grapefruit, troop
End like Leviathan, it's deep; well, let me try again

It shouldn't have to be like that

(Verse 2)
Lost in North America, stressed and led astray
In search of light so I could see a better day
Or maybe I could look from off the mountain top
A great king got dropped cuz he found the spot
He said umm "My eyes have seen the becoming"
And that's the very last speech that we heard from him
But I'ma remain on the scene and reign supreme
And go through many extremes, by any means
But I don't need a military, I'm ill already
I kill and bury with an aim still and steady
So bring me a bomb and ring the alarm
When I do harm I leave more dead than 'Nam
More casualties, more tragedies
On the mission to seize races, nationalities
And if it gotta be like that, then we attack
With various shades of black

Wisdom be leakin' out my grapefruit, troop
End like Leviathan, it's deep; well, let me try again

Wisdom be leakin' out my grapefruit, troop
End like Leviathan, it's deep; well, let me try again

Wisdom be leakin' out my grapefruit, troop
End like Leviathan, it's deep; well, let me try again

Wisdom be leakin' out my grapefruit, troop
End like Leviathan, it's deep; well, let me try again

It shouldn't have to be like that

(Verse 3)
We got to travel in harmony, in tune with the movement
Make moves in unison all crews represent
Come together for the common cause for mine and yours
Fix the broken laws and open doors
We want in, or let the revolution begin
We've been beat before but this time we'll win
It's gonna take bravery to stop slavery
And days'll be full of flave and carefree
It's different now, the predicament I'm in
Judge with a grudge just cuz the color of my skin
Race brutality because of my nationality
And this is what they call reality
It's political, hypocritical, uncorrect
First I get lyrical then we come for wreck
Let's take control, they can't hold us back
And let's attack, with various shades of black

Wisdom be leakin' out my grapefruit, troop
End like Leviathan, it's deep; well, let me try again

Wisdom be leakin' out my grapefruit, troop
End like Leviathan, it's deep; well, let me try again

Yo check it out
This part of the revolution is gonna be televised
Ya-know-what-I'm-sayin'
This is Rakim Allah
Ya-know-what-I'm-sayin'
The last platoon coming to through your neighborhood ?
Ain't nothin' change but the year
For '95 so c'mon
