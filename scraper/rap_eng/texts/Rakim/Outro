What is, the one, main thing that you have
That you would want people to remember you by?
Or not one but the, those things that are dear to you
That you would, want to be remembered as
I guess, I guess it's my words man, you know what I mean?
Just my words, and, if people remember my words
They'll remember me forever you know?
God by nature mind raised in Asia, you know?
But umm, it's like you know to live forever you you you gotta
Set you know, not not set trends but you gotta
Apply yourself a certain way and you gotta do certain things you know?
Maybe, maybe when I'm gone twenty years from now
Somebody might be tellin', tellin' they little son
"Oh yo you think shorty bad? Yo I 'member this cat way back
In like nineteen-ninety, kid named Rakim, bananas"
You know what I'm sayin'?
If that can happen man, I'm aight man, you know?
I got, I got, I got kids you know?
They gonna, they gonna umm, finish this for
Me anyway you know what I'm sayin'?
So regardless, you know the legacy lives
But umm as far as the masses just remember my words straight up
