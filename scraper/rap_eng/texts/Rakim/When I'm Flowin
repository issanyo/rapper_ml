[Intro]
Yes, yes y'all, check it out y'all
Yes, yes y'all, check it out y'all

[Hook]
Yo,I find a show, rhyme til it's time to go
I'm designed to blow, my mind's inclined to flow
Yo, my M.O., makin all kind of dough
From the info that Rakim show, y'know?

[Verse 1]
Yes yes y'all, I still fiend by any means
To flow, and I go through extremes don't intervene
My adventures show like a three dimensional screen
Cause I mention many things and I'm presentin many scenes
Guess I'm telegraphic, motions energentic
Better tell em forget it, cause I'm telekinetic
Crowds is screamin, I choke the mic and keep squeezin
Styles seemin like I used a thousand words without breathin
Bustin techs like Russian Roulette I doubt you win
Freestyles like hand grenades without the pin
Composin, then leave the mic full of corrosion
Donâ€™t test this, or catch the asbestos exposure
At shows I spit flows with seven deadly venoms
Killin syllables with poisonous synonyms in em
Ideas is blowin, mics is blowin
From what I'm showin, see it, I keep it goin when I'm flowin

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
When I'm flowin, theoretically speakin like a drummer
I take you through the streets to the parks in the summer
Or illustrate, a time and place you never been in
And make you focus on the future after seein the beginning
And my style wilds, like Miles on the trumpet
Volume dial was kind of low, need to pump it
Up another notch turn the dial til it stops
More watts you got, more things to watch
Third eye's wide open, you're focused on the theory
Keep scopin til you hear me, words is spoken clearly
It's no smokescreens on the scenes that I'm showin
Man I keep it goin, damn I keep it flowin

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Two pages cause panic, freestyles is frantic
Thoughts is organic, flow is aerodynamic
Mic is volcanic, rhymes spread across the planet
I send out the scribe now the vibes gigantic
Now, I'm internationally known, mental capacities blown
I hope your microphone's accident prone
Raw footage is shown, but only showin scenes of my own
Leavin your periphereal vision in a zone
But not the twilight, from the insight that I write
And recite, in my mic'll be bright, cause I like
The night glowin, it's out of sight when I'm showin
Man I keep it goin, damn I keep it flowin

[Hook]

[Verse 4]
Yo, accurate tactics make 'em clap to this
When I move the crowd, my rhythm still don't miss
Breeze through melodies cause it's been a long time
My lyrics is fury and rappers hate to hear me rhyme
Every antidote that I quote, is no joke
Nobody's smilin in the ghetto from the notes I wrote
My high techniques wreck and disrespect beats
Have you follow-in the leader up and down the streets
So kick along as I rip a song with pull
As the rhyme goes on I get paid in full
It's Rakim, I'm indicating rhymes for the showing
Check it out y'all, I keep it goin when I'm flowing

[Hook]
