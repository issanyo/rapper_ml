[Intro]
Yeah
No further due
Know who it is
Uh huh

[Hook]
This is what it is, it's nothing, (ugh)
You thought it was a wrap, it's nothing (ghetto's across the world)
They got my phone tapped, it's nothing (Yo', this what they want)
Because the God is back, that's something (New York City)
This is what it is, it's nothing, (It's what they need)
You thought it was a wrap, it's nothing (East Coast to West coast)
They got my phone tapped, it's nothing (It's what it is)
Because the God is back, that's something (Across sea's, world-wide, baby)

[Verse 1]
Ayo, we..
Stuck in a time of drought, nothing to rhyme about
Ghetto and crime, on the grind, pulling iron out
Industry crying out, major labels buying out
Who put the fire out? Real Hip-Hop is dying out
Sounds like the perfect time for Ra, set off
A new beginning, let me finish where Nas left off
I went to LA to get with Dre, we tried to bridge the gap in
Take night, mix it with day, I guess it wasn't meant to happen
I move, lotta dudes hope I lose but its cool, baby
I'm like Ray, I make it do what it do, baby
Bounce like medallions 'til it's off the chain
And I remain up in the lab 'til it's engulfed in flames
Just call me too hot, same ol' hood look like a new spot
A new block, like Time Square 'fore the doo-wop
Without the gun on my Hip I bring the new Hop
For Scott La Rock, Freaky Tah, L, Biggie Smalls and 2Pac, I'm back

[Hook]
This is what it is, it's nothing
You thought it was a wrap, it's nothing
They got my phone tapped, it's nothing
Because the God is back, that's something
This is what it is, it's nothing
You thought it was a wrap, it's nothing
They got my phone tapped, it's nothing
Because the God is back, that's something

[Verse 2]
This is hell and hell is where the storm is, drug sellers kill for corners
Death is here to haunt us, the president's still in office
The heaven's hear the horrors, and letters fill with warriors
Deadly weapons fell before us, the Seventh Seal's upon us
Rakim won't fear, begin to fear, the end is here, you goners
Stiff as rigormortis, now let 'em feel the chorus
When the God spit, I'm still a yards stick of real performance
Record deals and touring, my repp is still enormous
I hit the block or party and mami's be watching papi
A show be smashed, photographed by the paparazzi
My army's armed and highly, don't bring no drama by me
It's deadly, fill your boy with blanks, slash, kamikaze
The alpha and omega, no doubted innovator
In front of your bodega, it's the style-originator
You doubters and you haters, Ra 'bout to end your data
With Writer's Block, I'm off the top, without the pen, no paper
The archeologist that y'all acknowledging
Then I start the apocalypse then watch the God demolish it
I heard the news, this the dude they wanna hear from
Take it from square one, lace up them Air One's
Then bring the new commandments to the planets
For living life in the hood and for the music fanatics
It's for the time's beyond and my love for writing songs
When the club mic is on, I'm on my just to cipher, bomb, I'm back

[Hook]
This is what it is, it's nothing
You thought it was a wrap, it's nothing
They got my phone tapped, it's nothing
Because the God is back, that's something
This is what it is, it's nothing
You thought it was a wrap, it's nothing
They got my phone tapped, it's nothing
Because the God is back, that's something

I'm Back...
