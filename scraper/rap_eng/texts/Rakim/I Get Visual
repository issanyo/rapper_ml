(Keep you goin' when I'm flowin' smooth enough)
Yes Yes Y'all, I still fiend by any means a flow
And I go through extremes don't intervene
My adventures show like a three dimensional screen
Coz I mention many things and I'm presenting many scenes
I guess I'm telegraphic, motions energentic
Better tell 'em forget it, coz I'm telekinetic
Ideas is blowin', mics is blowin
From what I'm showin, see it , I keep it goin' when I'm flowin

I get visual, scenes of the lyrical individuals critical
Non kids can do, I'm comin' through
I get visual, scenes of the lyrical individuals critical
Non kids can do, I'm comin' through

Poetical pages cause panic, freestyles is frantic
Thoughts is organic, flow is aerodynamic
Mic is volcanic, rhymes spread across the planet
I send out the scribe now the vibes gigantic
Now, I'm internationally known, mental capacitys blown
I hope your microphones accident prone, raw footage is shown
But only showin' scenes of my own
Puttin' your periphereal vision in a zone
But not the twilight, from the insight that I write
And recite, in my mic , will be bright , coz I like
The night glowin', its out of sight what I'm showin
Rappers are knowin', I keep it goin' when I'm flowin

I get visual, scenes of the lyrical individuals critical
Non kids can do, I'm comin' through
I get visual, scenes of the lyrical individuals critical
Non kids can do, I'm comin' through

When I'm flowin', theoritically speakin' like a drummer
I take you through the streets, to the park in the summer
Or illustrate, a time and place you've never been
And make you focus on the future after seein' the beginning
And my style wilds like Miles on the trumpet
Volume dial is kinda low , need to pump it
Up another notch, turn the dial till it stops
More watts you got, more things to watch
Third eye's wide open, you focus on a theory
Keep scopin' till you hear me, words are spoken clearly
Its no smoke screens on the scenes that I'm showin
Man I keep it goin', damn I keep it flowin

I get visual, scenes of the lyrical individuals critical
Non kids can do, I'm comin' through
I get visual, scenes of the lyrical individuals critical
Non kids can do, I'm comin' through
I get visual, scenes of the lyrical individuals critical
Non kids can do, I'm comin' through
I get visual, scenes of the lyrical individuals critical
Non kids can do, I'm comin' through

Accurate tactics make 'em clap to this
When I move the crowd, my rhythm still dont miss
Breeze through melodies coz its been a long time
My lyrics is fury and rappers hate to hear me rhyme
Every antidote that I quote, is no joke
Nobodys smilin' in the ghetto from the notes I wrote
My high techniques wreck and disrepect beats
Have you followin' the leader up and down the streets
So kick along, as I rip a song with pull
As the rhyme goes on I get paid in full
Its Rakim, indicating rhymes for the showin
Check it out y'all, I keep it goin' when I'm flowin

I get visual, scenes of the lyrical individuals critical
Non kids can do, I'm comin' through
I get visual, scenes of the lyrical individuals critical
Non kids can do, I'm comin' through
I get visual, scenes of the lyrical individuals critical
Non kids can do, I'm comin' through
I get visual, scenes of the lyrical individuals critical
Non kids can do, I'm comin' through
