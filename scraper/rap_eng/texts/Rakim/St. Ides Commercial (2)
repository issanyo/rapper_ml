Rakim, kick it
St. Ides, St.-St. Ides
Rakim, kick it
St. Ides
St. Ides, St.-St. Ides
Rakim, kick it

If this was target practice I'll hit the spot
Bullseye when the rhyme gets hot
Temperature like a meteor, I shoot it like a missile
Mission accomplished, now it's time to wet my whistle
Calm the fire, [?] red alert
Take a sip real quick and let it work
It's like mixed with something ice cold with lava
Not a little, but a lotta
Because I'm getting hotter
Summer madness, in the streets dead heat
Drippin' with sweat til it hits the concrete
Every word'll be hot like mercury
Rhyme displays the sunrays every verse'll be
Another roast causes sun strokes
When I get too close the mic smokes
Smokes, burst into flames and I'm about
To get some more St. Ides to put it out
So put it out

St. Ides, St.-St. Ides
St. Ides
St. Ides
