God MC
Look what y'all made me do

[Hook: Rakim]
It don't matter if I ain't on the page you want
Tell me what you want, I give it to you the way you want
Show you how to flow and how to flip any phrase you want
You just keep your eye on me
I show you how to emcee

If it's swag or the lyric display you want
Tell me what you want, I give it to you the way you want
Show you how to throw and how to rip any stage you want
I can show you how to emcee
Like you got a degree

[Verse 1: Rakim]
This is your Qu'ran or Bible
To be a true MC, icon and idol
The contents you put in your songs are vital
Like training for the UFC you want a title
Slam thoughts on the canvas, flip 'em and pin 'em
Metaphors and similes with synonyms in 'em
Spit heat around the town, the more you get it heard
Till you spit at least 3000 miles before it hit a curve
Then flaunt your rhymes in your rap pages
Wordplay to punchlines and catchphrases
Deep sport for players and ballers, new game
Street talk straight off the corners, new slang
I got heat for crowds for those that pursue it
Spitters, I show you flow till your vocals are through it
From social to freestyle, just focus into it
If you a G, I'll show you how the Coppola do it

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Rakim]
Forever sick like catchin AIDS is
In a class for greatness for matchin phrases
My predicates last for pages
Every letter fit, trendsetter like fashion statements
Recruits get a shine and they hope forever
I wrote some of the illest rhymes ever put together
Soon as I make 'em rappers take 'em
Analyze 'em for days and paraphrase 'em
I'm back, hip-hoppers'll back my scripts and documents
Raps hit the block, it's a wrap, it's the apocalypse
The hood give my rap flow names
Like 9/11 and crack cocaine
I hit the building, it get hotter in 'em
It's like birds, most rappers don't know how to flip 'em
I gotta hip 'em, get hop and show 'em how to spit 'em
I bust a rhyme and I school 'em for free, I scholarship 'em

[Hook]

[Bridge: Tracey Horton]
Competition know the deal, you're not ready now
Because you're dealin with the R, know how it's goin down
This is it, if you so sick, where your skills at?
No sir, ghostwriter, you can kill that

[Verse 3: Rakim]
It's hard, this intricate flippin' it isnâ€™t it bars is infinite
So Ra deliver it far different
Part lyricist, part instrument
Start spittin it the more articulate y'all rhythms get
Till every syllable you drop it pivotal
If it's not original it's not as memorable
Ill lyrical till you're so popular they sick of you
Pandemical threat, level 5, it's critical
Kill 'em off with a word like euthanasia
Till it spread to the youth in Asia
In the booth I'm major, my music's monumental, I'm a mogul
You wanna make sense? I'mma show you
You gotta put your life in them lines
Make the deaf hear, give sight to the blind
Make your flow tighter, brightest designs
So if the mic is your grind then biting's a crime
Especially if a ghostwriter's writin your rhymes
