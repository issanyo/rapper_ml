[Intro: John Hurt]
Winter and summer, Debussy used to work surrounded by flowers
His study overflowed with them
It would remind you of the line of Baudelaire:
"Sound and perfume swirling in the evening air"

[Verse 1: John Hurt]
It would remind you of the line of Baudelaire:
"Sound and perfume swirl in the evening air...
"Swirl in the evening air"

[Verse 2: Rakim]
Something about the evenin' air in the summertime
Certain sounds that I need to hear, I wanna rhyme
My inner vision causes my metabolism to climb
And then I splatter my wisdom and the design
I leave time suspended and when gravity’s lost
Metaforce to the world ain’t spinning no more
And from there I put the sounds to hear, no order there
So that we’re something y’all will compare to Baudelaire
Something y’all will compare to Baudelaire
Something y’all will compare to Baudelaire
("Sound and perfume swirl in the evening air")
Something y’all will compare to Baudelaire
("Sound and perfume swirl in the evening air")
("Sound and perfume swirl in the evening air")
