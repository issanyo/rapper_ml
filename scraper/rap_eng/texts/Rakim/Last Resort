(Verse 1)
I get up in the morn, bright
I was on the mic, man we got it on last night
But today my pockets are tight
Gotta find a way to get my money right
I'm jumping on my bike
In flight, scheming on everything in sight
Uptight, and then that kid cut me off at the light
Now I'm in a fight, but not quite
The kid ran up and he got bust with all my might
I got to find away, slide, find a hideaway
Change my overlay, now everything's A-OK
I watch the cops roll, kid is still knocked out cold
I'm on the phone
Oh yeah, I got my man on hold
A-yo meet me at the favorite spot at 1 o'clock
Call the crew, tell 'em to meet us on the block
Times is hard and I got laid off
The streets is the last resorts to get paid off

Need some money...money
Need some moolah, y'all...moolah, y'all

(Verse 2)
I'm at the top of the afternoon
It's 'bout to be on soon
Here come the last platoon
We monopolize unstoppable plots arise
The element of surprise, intelligent men on a rise
First we use a universal greeting
Then I get straight to the reason for the meeting
Stats are low, habits are slow
The welcome mat says go
And we can make stacks of dough
But it's back to the last resort
I got paid on
A kid, we had beef in the street to make it short
He swung and he missed
I trapped his fists and locked him
And then I snatched his watch off his wrist and dropped him
Here I am with another money making scam
We sell the Rolex and it's to the next plan
We got laid off but I can flip the money I made off
The streets is the last resorts to get paid off

Need some money...money
Need some moolah, y'all...moolah, y'all

(Verse 3)
This is how it's going down
A holiday called Hustler's Day spread the word around town
This affair should be held once every year
We could come out to play and the coast is clear
We got the ball tournaments 500 a man
When you win it's a grand and let your dough expand
But if that takes too long
We got the biggest Cee-lo game you ever seen going on
The minimum is 100 dollars to bowl
If your hands our cold we're taking side bets on the roll
And if you're interested something smooth like chess
Try to stress the best and seize all progress
Many events to earn plenty ?
For the finale, DJs and rappers represent
And count all the money you made off the day
And come forth to your last resort to get paid off

Need some money...money
Need some moolah, y'all...moolah, y'all
