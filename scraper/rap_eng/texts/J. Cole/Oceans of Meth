Daddy Mawn, Creatr on The Beat, J

[Verse 1: Daddy Mawn]
Smoking meth like chimney
Got all them bitches on me
Nate Mundi be the dealer
And meth always be my healer
My pipe be made of all gold
Smoking since three years old
Other kids be finger painting
I sit there just hailing Satan
Jeremy Skiba, Huff and Puff
Burn through that meth, It's never enough
Crystala Meth, Girls want the D
Endless Oceans of Meth, flowing like a sea

[Hook: J.]
Oceans of Meth x2
Swim at your own risk,Oceans of Meth
Oceans of Meth x2
Ain't no life guards, in these oceans of meth

[Verse 2: Creatr & Daddy Mawn]
All I smoke is meth and it can't get no greater
We going up and down like we was in an elevator
Beaches made of cocaine, Snort that shit all day
Oceans made of meth, Smoke that shit ALL DAY!
We love to smoke it or put it in a needle
We don't fuck with weed because that shit's illegal
Bill Clinton Straight Up Faded
Popping molly's overrated
Barack Obama is a mouse
Running meth labs out my house

[Hook J.]

[Verse 3: Creatr]
I love meth that's what I'm paying
I'm a god so start your praying
Austin likes that blonde ass
We smoke meth we don't go to class
Crank, Ice, Scooby Snax
Super Ice and L.A. Glass
Chalk, Dust, Cap'N Crunch
Trash, Garbage, White Munch
Geared up go fast
Chicken Flipping, Lithium Scabs
Crankster Gangster Got twacked
Box Labs, Getting glassed
Put meth on my pizza, it acts as the chedda
OH GOD IT'S METH, WHAT COULD BE BETTA?
Go straight to J. and get this meth spinning
Got Daddy Mawn in The Lab and We Charlie Sheen WINNING
520 Crank It Meth
My Crystal is so strong
Swimming in these Oceans of Meth all Tweakend Long

[Hook: J.]
