Verse : I’ve seen so many avenues , I’ve seen many journeys
But I have never seen this aura that is displayed before me 
Stories coming along my life but this will be the best story 
In this one I found my wife , and I give God the glory 
Different views , different perspectives but we share the same spirit 
If this love was on a surface then I’d just wanna smear it , wear it not tear it 
I would display it in every matter 
If this love covered a canvas I would make sure it’s splattered 
I wanna see the sunshine even through the disasters 


Hook: I just wanna intertwine our souls
Loving you and never letting go
Mountaintops and valleys , bumpy roads
Loving you is never getting old

Verse : tell me pretty lady do you feel me ?
And melanin is worth more than gold
Your soul gives natural healing
We may bend but we sure will never fold
Your laugh is always a remedy
Your smile ,can light up an aisle
And yes you are so complimentary
This bond is forever and a while


Hook: I just wanna intertwine our souls
Loving you and never letting go
Mountaintops and valleys , bumpy roads
Loving you is never getting old

Verse: cool out , relax , cuddle perhaps 
I want your love 
I’m thinking of —
You all the time 
Love that you’re mine —
You’re hard to find —
You are a dime 
Connect the soul 
Come feed the mind 
Let’s take a trip - enjoy the climb
- let’s spend some time -
Come dance and whine -
I’ll get behind

Hook: I just wanna intertwine our souls

Loving you and never letting go

Mountaintops and valleys , bumpy roads

Loving you is never getting old

J: being in this red room what do you picture?
What do you envision as youre walking in?
Is it love? is it lust?
Is it desire or is it passion?
How about anger? have you ever been pissed the fuck off before?
Well, we all have. Tell me , what do you envision in this red room
