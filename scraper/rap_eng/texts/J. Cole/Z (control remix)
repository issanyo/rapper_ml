My info infamous i go loco rapping
My flow so venomous it'd kill a komodo dragon
My actions villainous like a Darth Sidious
U even witness it yet totally oblivious
The chosen one strong in the force anaking
Make your heart speed up like an ambien panicking
Bust these lines like an a wal combatant
Feel these line like u caught an attachment
I make up for what i don't have so im never lacking
Turn this poetry and a beat into a passion
Go ape shit tear this beat rampage total destruction
Flip the world upside turn to total dysfunction
My words a wild west flow see who draws the fastest
My competition can catch bullets like target practice
Ima leave u retired or plain dead figuratively
Have me reading an excerpt at your fucking eulogy
Who is me? i go by the title of z
Ima a dream so i got endless posabilites
Ima carrying this game like its in my back pack
Ahead of the line like six flags n i had a flash pass
