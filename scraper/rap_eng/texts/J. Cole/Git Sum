[Verse One] [Wordsworth]:
Now or never

[Punchline]:
We down together
We the future

[Wordsworth]:
Cause what we do now's forever
Came with a better song

[Punchline]:
And never sounded better

[Wordsworth]:
Dug deep underground

[Punchline]:
Now you found the treasure

[Stricklin]:
We 'bout to get a whole mound of cheddar and get our name hot
Get it poppin' and stop standin' in the same spot
The money worth it but the fame not
It only give you grief and get you in more beef than Game got

[Punchline]:
Claim spots
With this New York rap
Like Flava Of Love, we bringin' New York back
Watch the dough stack
Shit I rip MC's
Diss me and be an unsolved mystery

[Wordsworth]:
Back to back though consistently
Can't quit, I'mma spit till nobody can exist but me
At this point can't spit for free
My daughter need kicks and gifts for under the Christmas tree
Learn the history
It's the E

[Masta Ace]:
Don't forget MC

[Stricklin]:
And y'all dudes ain't really shit to me
Cause yo, I don't give a fuck about them guns that you not blastin'
And I don't really care about the checks that you not cashin'
Or the chicks, you know the ones that you not smashin'
I'll fuck around and punk all you cats and I'm not Ashton
I'm a brand new pair of Tims, I'm high fashion
I'm takin' everything that I want and I'm not askin'

[Masta Ace]:
I got passion, that's why I do what I does
Timberland beef and brocs while your crews into Lugz
And you can stop doin' them drugs
Fall back, be easy
East coast, NYC, Mid Weezy

[Punchline]:
Believe me, we steal the show, straight thieve it
Like Magic, you say you ill but I don't see it
Believe it
Drop more Juelz/jewels than Santana
Rob a bank with no mask and wave at the camera

[Wordsworth]:
Raisin' the standards, our phrases and grammar

[Punchline]:
PA to Atlanta
VA to Havana

[Wordsworth]:
They waitin' to ban us
Raisin' a hand up

[Punchline]:
Amazed and they amped up
They praise and they stand up

[Wordsworth]:
Like Nate when he slam dunks

[Punchline]:
Battle, put a grand up
Feel me though
I get dough your style trash
I fathered your style, you a son/Sun like Steve Nash
I get cash
Opposed, get slowed down so

[Masta Ace]:
Let's go

[Verse Two] [Sean Price]:
Get some of this
Yeah, Sean Price lyricist of the year with a spliff and a beer
When the piff in the air, the smoke alarm go off
I smoke more than Snoop, I'm such a fuckin' show off
Paul Orndorff, Mr. Wonderful rap shit
Tao Kwon Do flow off the wall, I back flip
Piss mattress gymnastic, Ruck is the hood type
Five on the black hand side like what it look like
Yo, Sean don't care about the ones you got
If I did then your head would have a sunroof top
I'm ready to do, whatever I do
Like break the head off your shoulder I'll Freddy your do
Take it back like wearing Pro Keds on the stoop
But upgraded like throw the infrared at your group
Niggas wanna see the veteran flop
I put out Monkey Barz now niggas say I'm better than Rock

[Masta Ace]:
Let's go, get some
Let's go, come on then
