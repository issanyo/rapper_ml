[verse 1: Jaimeson]
Falling like a season
A calling for some reason
A cure for all diseases
Sneezing when your freezing
Snot drips on lips
A warm cup of coffee
A hot bitch rubs
The Vicks Vapor off me
The fluid in my lungs
Keeps flowin' on time
You'll find that I'm the one
Know that it's a sign
From father P
A moment of silence...
Everyone knows
We're gonna make it this time
And eat our young
While we beat our drum
I'm a doo-doo chaser
America's on the runs!
Shits and giggles
Reading fingers from the middle
Tiggle bitties
Little kiddies
P-diddy's so cynical
Pool all our races
Together we're winnable
These facts for our cases
I know you can't dismiss 'em
All you piss me off
Here's a kiss so soft...
And cough
You finally got what I've been sayin?
So cuddle up
In a sweaty bed with a dready head
Ponder what he said and spread your legs

[Chorus]
Keep steady
Keep steady
Keep steady
Keep steady

[reprise]
Over head blanket
While we sleep
Over imaculation
Ejaculation
Conversation
More ejaculation
You might ask yourself
What comes after this?
Shit, i know
I'll go one more time
For pure funk and nastiness
Pure funk and nastiness
Had enough?
Class is dismissed
But you stick around
You can't resist
It's pure funk and nastiness
