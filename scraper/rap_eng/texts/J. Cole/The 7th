[Verse 1: Saint Felix]
They always said with my potential I could excel
As a youngin’ in my levis’, I was just trying to raise hell
Steve Austin in the ring, I was going for gold
With the whole world in my hands, Everything that I could hold
I told them just you wait and see
Niggas askin’ me, What I’m Gonna Be, I’m out here racing the fucking grand prix
Steady Working stayin’ up late, Bouta start my own new wave, with moongate
Smilemore the motto, takin’ off in the apollo
I was born in New York, got them country niggas shook, Charging 5k for a hook
Rook, Brooklyn, on the outskirts of the Stuy
Super Fly
Young Black Nigga Pants Sag’
(What about Luka?)
My brother Luka’s where it’s at tho
HEYITSLUKA, All Caps tho
You gotta go and hear em
Hebrew in my blood, I'm repping
My nigga blaine and my nigga ace
We got it on smash, niggas from the 4
We do this for Baltimore

[Hook: J.]
Man, I Blew Up
Should’ve Knew, But
I Get That Every Niggas Bound to Have Some Screw Ups
Yeah, You Wanna Be Fly
Yet, You Still Asking For Rides
Don’t Keep Wasting All My Time
Ain’t Got No Money to Buy
Na Na Na

[Verse 2: Saint Felix]
Worked on my verse last night
(I Had A Dream!)
Woke Up, Spoke Up
It’s Time to Change the World
For the Better
This is an open letter
Momma said I’m a Pacesetter
Pops couldn’t stay with momma
Gave me a taste of the drama
Moved to Minnesota
It Was The Late Night Trips to Chicago
Taught Me the Blues, Put Soul in My Shoes
Tale of 4 Cities, Acid like the sixties
Whiskey, Got me Tipsy
Parents got me speaking better than half of these white kids
Vans different than the J’s on the black kids
This Life is a blessing
It’s April 7th Bitch

[Hook: J., Saint Felix, The Wave, and The Moon Child]
Man, I Blew Up
Should’ve Knew, But
I Get That Every Niggas Bound to Have Some Screw Ups
Yeah, You Wanna Be Fly
Yet, You Still Asking For Rides
Don’t Keep Wasting All My Time
Ain’t Got No Money to Buy
Na Na Na
