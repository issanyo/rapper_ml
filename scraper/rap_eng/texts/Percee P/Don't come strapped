I got a greater rhyme and state of mind
If you wack I won't say a line or pay a dime to hear ya
What I dare ya, to step up
Diss you fast, hit ya ass with the trash you get swept up
2 out of 3 states, know the P's great, and yell out
If I sell out it's only on my release date
Huh I came out, had these bitches screaming my name out
Now they wanna see me, believe me, that easy
Swing you bust, when I sing and cut, nigga hang it up
Bringing what pal, you ordered that style from Finger Hut
When Percee P sing a rhyme, your comp get stomped
Cause they can't swing a line so they bring a nine

Don't come strapped, I come here to rap and tell them people
(Clap your hands everybody)
Don't come strapped, I came here to rap and tell them people
(Clap your hands and what)
(Leave your 9's at home and bring your skills to the battle)

Girls just giving me sex, I eat ’em like a T-Rex
I’m playing but I have ’em saying "me next, me next"
You can't compare me yo, with these other brother's material
On your stereo but you don't hear me though
You better handle it son, don't step to me
Or try to do me, don't wanna sue me when some damage is done
My tune rocks, the speakers on your boom box
Keep my hotel room locked and let ya on that boom knock
I never take breaks and hoe’s with the great shape
I hate snakes, fakes screaming date rape to make papes
I always set it off, the best, the stress I get it off
My chest, you test and let it off

Don't come strapped, I come here to rap and tell them people
(Clap your hands everybody)
Don’t come strapped, I came here to rap and tell them people
(Clap your hands and what)
(Leave your 9's at home and bring your skills to the battle)

I'm taking everyone out, who tell me, "yo shit will never sell P"
The hell g, just wait until my LP come out
And bitches will be asking to me
The nigga who be blasting a jeep
They used to pass in the street
The cutie say more, I’ll be damned if the booty's paid for
I’m live in a fort like Rudy Vaymour
For me pall, bet you got the deal try’na be wild
Or senile, but I got mine just busting freestyle
I set a slick rhyme, people causing sending letters quick
To say I’m better with words and herps dropping rhetoric
I get retarded black, causing cardiac
Arrest in the BX where hip hop started at
But way back niggas was still strapped
Didn’t freestyle when the rap, your proving your act
On the map, and tell another people come running

Don't come strapped, I come here to rap and tell them people
(Clap your hands everybody)
Don’t come strapped, I came here to rap and tell them people
(Clap your hands and what)
(Leave your 9's at home and bring your skills to the battle)
