(Verse 1)
Percee P your highness
Raps finest and imma prove it, so move it
I'll eat you and who ever you get
What i'm packing is worse than a Mac-10, so back down
You're wack now like back then
Ain't nothing changed you're still that same sucker now
Roast everyone of you cause none of you can fuck around
I'll fight fear and rip him right here
I'm dissing, leave you twisting turning like a nightmere
No one can stop me top me or copy, my style or rap while you're rap is sloppy
You're a big doof, i'll fuck your girl on a roof
Yeah, I'll even give you the panties back if you want proof, troop
Atleast have props but, you're bummy coming outside
Trying to spoil like your bullshit ride
You're no frills plus have no skills, no grills, no wheels on your mobile so chill
Just lost, you made yourself
Stepping to me trying to do me money, you just played yourself
We can go deep, but your so cheap so weak, kicking riddles like little bo peep
Your rhymes are all wack you better crawl back
No one can touch me meaning I must be all that
My rhymes will pass ya, you'll never outlast em
Crush and busting at ya that adds to bruce lee's master
When I kick a verse clown you're out in the first round
You shoulda known that when they put perc down

(Chorus)
Put his head to bed
Put his head to rest
Put his head to bed
Put his head to rest
Put his head to bed
Put his head to rest

(Verse 2)
You's a wanna be
If you attempt to front on me you're gonna be through
The next round you ain't gonna see
You ain't shit clown, nigga sit down with a (? 1:29)slam behind this stage you will get found
No one can do me, step to me i'll back you up smack you up and take your toolie
Dumb clown when the p come down you won't have a chance
I'll bury you like an avalanche
Your rhymes are weak wax so don't even speak black
If I get you imma hit you 50 feet back
Save the bass for crackheads, fool i'll bust you like a blackhead and send you back dead
Set you up cut you up like a chef shank your sword b
Back up off me your breath stink
Yous a bum so what you can't fret today, probably wear (? 1:56) like you did yesterday
On the mic I'll take your heart, don't even start grabbing shit
(Why?)
Cause I ain't having it
New jacks try to get swift, diss, tongue twist
Buncha amateurs can't even toungue kiss
You's a sucka mutha fucka, bow and pay your respects man
I'm signing off with the next man

(Chorus)
Put his head to bed
Put his head to rest
Put his head to bed
Put his head to rest
Put his head to bed
Put his head to rest

(Verse 3)
When I rip shop you'll get dropped, get chopped
Shit stops when I ziplock your fake hip-hop, you tripping
Give you a fast ass whipping plus i'm gripping the mic
You start flipping, you better start dipping
I'm puttin' your head to bed leaving head rich in the bitch while her legs are spread
I'm marvelous, lyrically i'm hard to diss
An arsonist, even burn your carcasses
Huh, so you better hide your bitch
If you head blow up, when I show up i'mma go up side the shit with a fucking trash can
A rush a bust to let you know you cause there will be a last stand
It'll be crews that will probably swing, but i'm throwing out
I ain't going out like rodney king
He makes hits on the great shit, but I make hits and don't take shit from niggas kicking fake shit
He gets no set, but he don't flex cause I can get nasty and then a bloody (3:06)

(Chorus)
Put his head to bed
Put his head to rest
Put his head to bed
Put his head to rest
Put his head to bed
Put his head to rest
