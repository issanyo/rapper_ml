[Verse One]
If you got the balls do me
Fasten cars to me, punchlines are so puny
Since y'all knew me, I been deep like Paul Mooney
I might show up so get a hearse
Ain't no nigga worse, stab me when I kick a verse, mic's blow up
Like a nuclear blast, you see a flash that melt ya
Fallout shelter can't help ya ass
I still
Flow the same, put a pro to shame
Lyrics blow your brain need Novacane when I build
You rewind tapes cause ever line's great
I outshine fakes till my mind stays up like the crime rate
Rappers today bite and pray nights
Wishing that they bright or say hype rhymes their mind's assaulted mics
Anonymous
Rappers be trying to fuss, "He's outshining us."
Rhymes I bust, have you laid up like patients who take on a bus

[Verse Two]
I'm a sweet lover
But don't sleep brother
When I creep motherfuckers take deep cover, with each other
I bury men
My flow have to bury with vocabulary so no adversary win
Will's telling me, for real, fellas be still jealing me
Cutie's making booty calls like Bill Bellamy
Hoes are hot
Foes are shot down, but the flows I got
Clubs close a lot, cause I blows the spot
Fucking threat ya heard nothing yet
No need for bucking tec's for rappers to duck and fret or up and jet
Bustas and marks are first to die when I spark the verse
Park a hearse for those that started with Perc-
-ee P, he be burning dicks like V.D
Only way you can see me is on T.V
Legs are spread like newlyweds in sheds I dead what's said
Since putting heads to bed then fled from FEDS
Yo' hoe ass got a vendetta cause I always been better
A trendsetter, fans send letters to me instead of yo' ass

[Verse Three]
I came down to shame clowns kicking my same sound
I'mma reign now, if y'all ain't fix, split a James Brown
I'm the poet who's rhyme was quoted
Lines are loaded, shine then coated befo' they flowin'
Showing signs I wrote it
I outta auction these, style cost some G's
Challenger's eyes make tears like the Force MD's
Percee P that's me I gets nasty
Rugged, flashy, pass me the mic it's your ass G
What I make wreck's tape decks
At my apex packing latex for safe sex
From chickens tricking pay checks
Killing ya
Filling ya with rhymes similar to bullets in the cylinder of a Dillinger
Spilling your brains out
I'll blast ya later
You're reading essay's on me the next day like JFK's assassinator
Nobody
Ever went to represent it's evident why you hesitant
Cause I'll take every cent and your hottie
