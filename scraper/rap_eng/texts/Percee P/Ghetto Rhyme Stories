Uh

This a message going out to all you thugs and gangstas

Black males who pack jails
You 'ain't gotta go out over crack sales and murder
Just act well

Peep the message

It's gory
A story about my man from around the way
Who's not around today
'cus I didn't know if you'd hung out with me
He'd forget me if he got strung out
On the hoe that goes to record parties
Every week the type of freak that sneak and sleep with everybody

We used to hang and hope we'd see chicks
Around this town with that OPP shit
We met two at the club
The same night we heat em, we did em because we kick our game right
The girl he met? had a lot of shit
She gave him a lot of cash and a lot of ass but got him whipped

Driving around in a BM and for weeks I didn't see him
Then people would come round sayin'
"that chick your boy's fuckin' with? that bitch 'a get you gunned down"
And tell me her man sells crack
A known drug dealer, a thug killa' who just got out of jail, black!
I tried to tell him but he didn't listen
I was burnt up.. until he turned up missin'
I stayed up till they found his weight up
Brotha' struck in by a mother-fuckin' Uzi, all laid up

Thrown in a ditch

Yeah

(CHORUS)
Over a B.I.T.C.H


Hey yo, you know whats the funny shit?
What son?
Now honey dip is back on money's tip
That chick 'ain't shit yo
My nigga died from the trigger
I had it figured from the get go
Now somebody gots' ta' go
That chick or the cat that matched the hole
I'm 'a get me an infrared scope
Leavin' him for dead with a bullet in the head
For killin' my man over a female
On the DL, it's gonna be hell
He won't see jail but see shells falling from my Glock 9, I got mines
Tuck and won't give a fuck, I'll buck anyone who drops dime
Brains will get blown out, Pop!
'cus it feels me that's the way he'll be goin' out
I'm 'a ride until I commit this homicide, then I'm 'a hide
I got the 9 on my hip, gripped, ready to flip on this pussy whipped dick
Who tripped over this B.I.T.C.H

(CHORUS)

Drivin' around with my window down when I spotted him
'shotted him, makin' him go down
Gotta get to the bus port, I'm wanted son
On the run with a body on the gun that I just bought

Caught in arrival by 5-O when I got here
Now I rot here behind bars kickin' this true shit
Sounds crazy but maybe fit the chick that you with
So look out for them honeys that nicely built
Wanting to get laid like a pro might get you killed sonny

Word

Not the ladies
