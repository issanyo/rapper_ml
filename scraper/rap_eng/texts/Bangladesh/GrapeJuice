[Intro]
Yea, start, yo
Mhm, here it goes man

[Verse 1: Zane]
So yea, I'm drinking orange juice
It's terrible
I go to mom and say
You're terrible
And then
My dad comes in
He's like
"You're white"
And then I'm like
"Well 'ya fat"
And then he just cries
He cries, he cries
The dog comes over, he's like
No
And then I'm like
No
And then
Oh, yea
Everything explodes
Everything's dead
There is blood all over my toe
Why? Why?
The dog is white
He was just brown a minute ago!

[Hook: Zane]
I can't believe this
I just can't
And my toe, my toe

[Verse 2: Zane]
I beat up my dog
He's all sad
I beat up myself
I'm sad
And then, it's silent
Then my mom comes in
She punches the wall
The wall is just breaking down
The house is tumbling
I can't believe
It's all rumbling
And then
I'm -um- humbling
And then -uh-
A cow comes in
And he's like
MOO!
And then
Next thing you now
My dog runs in
He's all well
But now he's got Spartan armor
It's all -um-
Karma
It's -um-
*inaudible noise*
I just don't know
I'm speechless

[Hook: Zane]
But then, next thing you know
What comes up
From the sky
A beautiful bird
What do I call this bird?
Jeffery
Jeffery comes down
Gives me a slice of pepperoni
I'm like "uh"
That's -um- dankeroni
And then, next thing you know
He's dead

[Verse 3: Zane]
Yea, yea
He's dead
In the bed
Oh, oh
And everything's red
I'm-I'm-I'm
Dead
Everything is
Everything is
Everything
Is anything real here, yo?
Oh yea
No
What do I think about your toe?
Well, it'll grow back
Yea...
And what do I think about
That -um-
What do I think about that -um-
What do I think about that -um-
