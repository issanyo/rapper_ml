[Verse 1]
Never met a girl with that style and that groove
That with somethin' special just like you
Baby, you didn't did some things to my mind
On me why got me thinkin'
I remember the times

[Pre-hook]
Oh baby, what'd I do?
Oh baby, what'd I do?
All I want is you
Baby, baby, what'd I do to you?

[Hook]
All I want to do
Is make love to you, all night
All I want to do
Is make love to you, for live

[Verse 2]
Never met a girl with a smile and a groove
That would change my life around like you
Baby, you didn't did some things
Had my mind in the clouds
Thinkin' that I never wanna come down
