Oh now baby
You know you got the better of me
Your not what I expected to see
But lately it's not like it was meant to be
On no i can't stop my mind from wandre'n
Moves even closer
Cause me a heart attack
Gettin' to know ya'
No point in looking back
She looked at me
She's not gonna' leave me be
So won't you lean a little bit closer now
'cause girl you get me up and down
(oh-oh-oho)
Oh won't you lean a little bit close now
'cause girl I get the feeling that you know just how
(oho-oho)
Oh now baby
I just want this story straight
(you-know)
It's getting hard to communicate
But maby I think it's just a little late
On I can't stop my mind from wandre'n
Moves even closer
Feelings are coming back
No one can know
It's more than a heart attack
She looked at me
She's not gonna' leave me be
So won't you lean a little bit closer now
'cause girl you get me up and down
(oh-oh-oho)
Oh won't you lean a little bit close now
'cause girl I get the feeling that you know just how
(oho-oho)oho-oho
Lean a little bit closer
Oh won't you lean a little bit closer now
All my life
Been dream'n of you
All my life
All my life
Been dream'n of you
All my life
So won't you
So won't you lean a little bit closer now
'cause girl you get me up and down
(oh-oh-oho)
Oh won't you lean a little bit close now
'cause girl I get the feeling that you know just how
(oho-oho)
So won't you lean a little bit closer now
'cause girl you get me started now
(oh-oh-oho)
Oh won't you lean a little bit close now
'cause girl you get me up and then I come back down
(oho-oho)
Lean a little bit closer
Oh won't you lean a little bit closer now
Lean a little bit closer
Oh won't you lean a little bit closer now
