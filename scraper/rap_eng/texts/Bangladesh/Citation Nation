[Verse 1]
Excuse my persistence, cause this is for consistence
APA failures, y’all need assistance
And I'm here to give it, let me explain
The general format for a journal article is plain
It’s easy like a recipe, start off with the last name
And now the initials, but wait two names?
Is it the same? I mean I got you man
Just put an ampersand between them and reclaim your fame

[Bridge]
But don’t forget the comma after the first initials
That’s important
Now stay with me, it’s about to get difficult
Don’t get distorted

[Verse 2]
Put the year in parentheses, and a period after with ease
Now the title is tough, don’t worry, Van Schaack agrees
Start it capitalized, but then all lowercase
Unless there’s a colon, then uppercase after the first space
Capitalize all proper nouns, that’s common sense
And a period after the title ends, for all your friends
Yeah, we almost done, too bad cause it’s been fun
We just need the name of the journal and the page number

[Bridge]
Yeah, this is a little break, we almost through
Let’s go, this is it, shout out to Radoo, alright

[Verse 3]
Put the journal title in, and italicize it
And all the major words? Well capitalize them
Yeah, and a comma after, that’s italicized too
One space after that and then we’re almost through
Now put the page number, or if there are multiple
Put a dash between the start and end, it’s beautiful
Because we’re at the finish line, put down the period
You can let out a sigh, this wasn’t that serious!
