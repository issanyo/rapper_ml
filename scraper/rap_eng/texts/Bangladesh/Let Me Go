(Let me) go, don’t you (let me)
Don’t let me go (let me) go
Baby don’t you let me
Brandy
(Let me) go, don’t you (let me)
D-Don’t let me go (let me) go
B-Baby dont you let me

You know how I get when you let me go
You you know how I get, you you know how I get
You know, you know how I get when you let me go
You know, you know how I get when you let me go

The way you love me it turns me up, boy
You make my heart pound a thousand times
To let me go it would burn me up, boy
So good we can just run away
You know that you’re my last
But got me feeling like my first one
Wanna do me in ways I can’t take
You know that I am that point
Ready to split it half, boy
Of course you know with that you just can’t let me down

(Let me) go, don’t you (let me)
D-Don’t let me go (let me) go
B-Baby dont you let me
(Let me) go, don’t you (let me)
D-Don’t let me go (let me) go
B-Baby dont you let me

You know how I get when you let me go
You you know how I get, you you know how I get
You know, you know how I get when you let me go
You know, you know how I get when you let me go

You turn me around anywhere we at boy
You’re so mannish but I love your ways
It don’t matter, you just love the touch boy
We always get caught halfway, I’m just saying
Love your cocky talk, damn your denims
Make me wanna act like I just can’t remember
If mama saw this side of me
She would be on twitter, saying
You know I didn't raise you that way

(Let me) go, don’t you (let me)
D-Don’t let me go (let me) go
B-Baby dont you let me
(Let me) go, don’t you (let me)
D-Don’t let me go (let me) go
B-Baby dont you let me

You know how I get when you let me go
You you know how I get, you you know how I get
You know, you know how I get when you let me go
You know, you know how I get when you let me go

I get chills when you’re with me
That the way you give it to me
If baby like that
And sometimes when you say it in my head
I replay it when you can’t be there
It just feels so good to have someone who stood
Anytime of day
(I) just wanna let you know
(That) never gonna let this go
Dont ever let go of me

(Let me) go, don’t you (let me)
D-Don’t let me go (let me) go
B-Baby dont you let me
(Let me) go, don’t you (let me)
Don’t let me go
B-Baby dont you let me

You know how I get when you let me go
You you know how I get, you you know how I get
You know, you know how I get when you let me go
You know, you know how I get when you let me go
