[Intro]
Gang, gang, gang, gang
Slim Jesus in the cut
You this beat live as fuck
Shout out Gucci
Blam, blam

[Verse]
Minute Maid lemonade, what I'm pouring up today
Yellow diamonds shining, my ear look like some lemonade
I done fucked around and blew up like a hand grenade
Now everything I do end up in headlines on the front page
I've gotten used to being rich so I ain't never going back
So if rap fails today then I'ma go and cop me a pack
Break it down, sell it off, and I'ma get it right back
And if I catch you with the check then best believe I'm running that
And if the Ops catch me lacking, I ain't going like no bitch
So if you run up on me, you gon' eat a full clip
Broke boy said he coming to my show, ain't pulled up to shit
He prolly just mad cause I got the clout and I could fuck his bitch
Speaking of fucking bitches, I been doing that a lot
Finesse the fuck out the rap game and still ain't got caught
So I'm just posted up stacking my money and pulling these thots
And if anybody tryna stop me, I got a forty with a mop
I found out everything I need in my life is the same color green
That's right, I be just getting money and smoking weed
Cause all I had back then was a dollar and a dream
Now I done fucked the game up and passed that bitch to my team

[Outro]
Ayy, young and ignorant
2015 bitch
Free Guwop
Everyday is 10/17 til they free big Gucci
Squad
