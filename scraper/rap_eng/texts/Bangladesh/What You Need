[Verse]
I want to take you away
Where you've never been, never been
Making sweet love where the water falls, water falls
All over us at the perfect temperature
The sky so sunny
Do you hear, do you hear the violins playing?
If you listen closer, you can hear them saying
That my eyes and my lips got something
That they both wanna do to you

[Hook]
Baby, I got what you need, baby I got what you need
Baby, I got what you need, baby I got what you need
Baby, I got what you need, baby I got what you need
Baby, I got what you need, baby I got what you need
I'll be in the kitchen, in your favorite position
I'll be in the kitchen, in your favorite position
I'll be in the kitchen, come, come, come and get me
I'll be in the kitchen, come, come, come and get me

[Verse 2]
Fire, fire, candle, candle, I burn
Just enough to make it hot
You wanna shoot me to the moon
I wanna shoot you there first
Take off all my clothes in exchange for yours
Saying sexy words in Spanish yo quiero tu
Yeah, baby boy, you're so mannish
So go and lay your head back
Let me blow this on for you

[Hook]
Baby, I got what you need, baby I got what you need
Baby, I got what you need, baby I got what you need
Baby, I got what you need, baby I got what you need
Baby, I got what you need, baby I got what you need
I'll be in the kitchen, in your favorite position
I'll be in the kitchen, in your favorite position
I'll be in the kitchen, come, come, come and get me
I'll be in the kitchen, come, come, come and get me

[Bridge]
Bombs bursting everywhere
All over my body
Free to admit
I didn't have some good
But never like this, uuu
You're so romantic sometimes
You run away with my mind
And what I get to you
They'll never know
They'll never know
Im your nurse, your masseuse
I'm your chef, cook for you
Guess what else I've got

[Hook]
Baby, I got what you need, baby I got what you need
Baby, I got what you need, baby I got what you need
Baby, I got what you need, baby I got what you need
Baby, I got what you need, baby I got what you need
I'll be in the kitchen, in your favorite position
I'll be in the kitchen, in your favorite position
I'll be in the kitchen, come, come, come and get me
I'll be in the kitchen, come, come, come and get me
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
