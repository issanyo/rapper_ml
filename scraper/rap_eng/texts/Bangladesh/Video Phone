[Intro]
Shawty, whatcha name is?

[Pre-Chorus]
Them hustlas keep on talkin'
They like the way I'm walkin'
You saying that you want me?
So press record, I’ll let you film me

[Chorus]
On your video phone (Make a cameo)
Tape me on your video phone (I can handle you)
Watch me on your video phone (On your video, video)
If you want me, you can watch me on your video phone

[Verse 1]
I love how you approach me
Fresh white, with your pants, hanging grown man low
Everything you sayin' soundin’ good to me
No need to convince me anymore
Swagger, it's right, one blade is tight
And I smell your cologne in the air
Baby, you doin' somethin' right
You just cancelled every other man here
You say you love my bag, and the color of my nails
You can see that I got it goin' on
I wanna make sure you remember me
So I'm gon' leave my number on your video phone
I got no time for frontin'
I know just what I’m wantin'
If it's gonna be you and me
When I call, they better see me on your video screen

[Pre-Chorus]
Them hustlas keep on talkin'
They like the way I'm walkin'
You saying that you want me?
So press record, I’ll let you film me

[Chorus]
On your video phone (Make a cameo)
Tape me on your video phone (I can handle you)
Watch me on your video phone (On your video, video)
If you want me, you can watch me on your video phone

[Verse 2]
You a cutie
You should let me put you in my movies
Do shoot into a star of your own hit song
We can shoot the video right here on my cellphone
I never seen a smile so pretty
I need to know I'll always have you wit' me
So take your picture on my video phone
You can pick your own song
And you could be the only one
I know you like that
Turn you into a star? I got it like that
Like that, baby, don't fight it
'Cause when I miss your call, I hit you right back
On my video phone

[Pre-Chorus]
Them hustlas keep on talkin'
They like the way I'm walkin'
You saying that you want me?
So press record, I’ll let you film me

[Chorus]
On your video phone (Make a cameo)
Tape me on your video phone (I can handle you)
Watch me on your video phone (On your video, video)
If you want me, you can watch me on your video phone

[Verse 3]
You know them G's, they be hollerin', 'specially them hot ones
Brooklyn, Atlanta, Houston, to New Orleans
When they see me, they be like "Yo B, let me call you"
You breakin' my focus, boy, you cute and you ballin'
You like it when I shake it?
Shawty on a mission, what your name is?
What? You want me naked?
If you likin' this position you can tape it
On your video phone
Hustla keep on talkin'
You like the way it's poppin'
You sayin' that you want me
Press record and baby, film me

[Chorus]
On your video phone (Make a cameo)
Tape me on your video phone (I can handle you)
Watch me on your video phone (On your video, video)
If you want me, you can watch me on your video phone
