[Intro]
And when she's not around, but I really need her
We make love, love, love (love through the speaker, make love...)
All you gotta do is close your eyes and turn me up

[Hook]
Make love through the speaker x8
Yeah, when her nigga ain't home, but I'm ready to see her
She turn the radio on and we
Make love through the speaker x5

She got a...

[Verse 1]
...Crazy-ass body with a bad-ass attitude
What you do is so good, I can't even get mad at you
She know what to give me when she tryna feed my appetite
Back at it again; see if you can top last night

Where the towel? I ain't throwing it in
Take a break, and then she on it again
Going for hours, I don't know how to end
Damn girl you got me growing again!

[Hook]
And when I ain't home, but I'm ready to see her
She turn the radio on and we
Make love through the speaker x5

Yeah, when her nigga ain't home, but I'm ready to see her
She turn the radio on and we
Make love through the speaker x5

[Bridge]
And when she's not around, but I really need her
We make love, love, love (love through the speaker, make love...)
All you gotta do is close your eyes and turn me up

[Verse 2]
Little bit of alcohol to try to get my mind right
Mama had me working while I put in overtime like
Anytime you need it from me, you know that I won't stop
Girl pick up the phone, and dial my number like I'm on-call
Love it when you feel up on me, girl your skin's so soft
Let me see that body; go and take your clothes off
We can do it until this song goes off
Put it on replay; play it 'til you dose off

[Hook]

[Bridge]

[Verse 3]
Right here is the part where we really get it in
About to blow the speakers out tryna catch her get it in
She loved it so much she played it all over again
Every single day I get a hundred million spins
Where the towel? I ain't throwing it in x3
Take a break, and then she on it again

[Hook]

[Bridge]
