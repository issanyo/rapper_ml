Yo I'm a new breed of rapper, like come out
Don't know how to flow but my flow is like what now
Said I couldn't rap man, maybe you should take it back like a boomerang
What is this bullshit?
What a minute, I should probably quit rap
At age 17, I'm ahead of these wack trap artists
Who are trying to become real MVPs of this rap shit like Ludacris on Theater of the Mind
Bitch, I'm ahead of my time
I'm like Optimus Prime, on the drop of a dime, I can transform quicker than you
Bitch, I'm on another level
Man, what're gonna do man
Superman, Lois Lane flow, Lil Wayne flow, but like the Carta II flow, not that new shit yo
Hold up, let me slow it down a little bit
Like, let me slow it down a little bit
I ain't a little kid, I'm a junior now
I'm like almost 17, man get on my level now
You can't level me up boy
You try to be tough boy
You can't do this, man your shit in the mud boy
Because you're grimy, you're grimy and you're slimy
Get on my level, man you fuckers should resign
You remind me of that old school rap, yeah that's what I'm trying to do
Man, get off that
They said I can't rap man, take that back
Take me back to the future, like Michael J. Fox
Bitch, I'm not a fucking loser like Beck
I'm on that, I'm off that
Man, I'm running this, you're barely jogging it
Wait, I live this shit, while you're blogging it
Wait, I film this shit while you're vlogging it
Ugh, hold up, wait a minute
Wait a minute, hold up
I've been great since like age 9, back on my YouTube channel
I'm so sublime, subliminal I'm killing these haters
Subliminally, I'm on another level, man I'm falling back in time, you motherfuckers ginger like Chettel ugh
Like, I don't even call him Chettel though
But Galen is the homie for life man, that's forever yo
Said I couldn't flow, like nobody ever did
Shoutout out to everybody for being so positive
Yeah, and tell them haters nothing, because I don't think have many haters, or am I bluffing?
Yeah man, it's Lu-Tang on them, the revision of Wu-Tang, I'm back on and I'm gone
