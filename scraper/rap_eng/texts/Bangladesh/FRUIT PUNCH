Imma fuck the game up so hard she can't put me down/
Ill nigga alert when you see me ridin' in ya town/
Steve Machida, world renowned/
My bars are potent, ultra sound/
One winged angel cause i'm heavensent, but hellbound/
Countin' gold and silver cause im trappin' outta johto bitch/
Never leave the ouse without my motorola razr bitch/
Im the shit and thats a muthafuckin snapple fact/
I should have a felony the way i fuckin murder tracks/
Im gettin charlotte's web money when im spinnin racks/
Goin kaio ken off the blunt, the super saiyan pack/
The old school southern flow is what i'm bringin back/
I wrote this im my deathnote, so you know i killed the track/
I leave you niggas with a heart attack/
Leave a hole where ya muthafuckin heart is at/
I put you in the sand coffin/
It'll be painless i promise/
