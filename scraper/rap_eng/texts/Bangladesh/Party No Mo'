P-p-party, I'mma party till I just can't party no mo
(Party, I'mma party till I just can't party no mo)
Party, I'mma party till I just can't party no mo
(Party, I'mma party till I just can't party no mo)
Let's take a shot
(Take a shot)
Take a shot
(Take a shot)
Party, I'mma party till I just can't party no mo
(Party, I'mma party till I just can't party no mo)

[Verse 1: Ludacris]
I done had about four, five, six shots, yeah, I'm gettin' wasted
Red pills, blue pills, yeah, I'm in the Matrix
Two swisha, three swisha, four swisha, five
So turn my music up and tell these hoes to get live
Got a pocket full of hundreds and some bottles on ice, ice
Conjure and lime got a nigga feelin' nice, nice
Dessert on my hips so if you gamble, roll the dice
When I let it off once it make a nigga think twice
You got more dough then, homie, you gon' have to show me
You never say it rains like Tony, Tony, Tony
My Chevy's outside and it's sittin' on Kobe's
And I keep the hood with me like Obi Wan Kenobe
Wood grain trim, seat softer than your butt, butt
Make your car rattle from the speakers in my trunk, trunk
Swisha's burnin' slow and it got a nigga stuck, stuck
But don't be a fool cause the tool's on tuck, tuck

[Hook]
P-p-party, I'mma party till I just can't party no mo
(Party, I'mma party till I just can't party no mo)
Party, I'mma party till I just can't party no mo
(Party, I'mma party till I just can't party no mo)
Let's take a shot
(Take a shot)
Take a shot
(Take a shot)
Party, I'mma party till I just can't party no mo
(Party, I'mma party till I just can't party no mo)

[Verse 2: Ludacris]
Tell that slow bitch to bring another round, we gon' party till the sun's up
Ladies rub your titties and my gangsta's put your guns up
Money, money, money, if you got it, throw your one's up
And if they ain't got it, tell 'em shut up, you dumb fuck
My money stays in hand, you could say I got a grip, grip
Out to scoop my chips, you could say I got a dip, dip
Cause I talk money while these haters talk shit, shit
And if they keep on talkin', I'mma empty out a clip, clip
But I don't want no problems, I'm just tryin' to get my game on
Take a couple shots and use the alcohol to blame on
Holla at some chicks and find a bitch to put my name on
Then I'mma be the, I'ma be the one she put that thang on
I got the perfect song to make you want me wanna shake, shake
And take her to the crib, I don't take her on no date, date
We all up in the club till the glass and table break, break
And all they wanna know is how much more that I can take, take

[Hook]
P-p-party, I'mma party till I just can't party no mo
(Party, I'mma party till I just can't party no mo)
Party, I'mma party till I just can't party no mo
(Party, I'mma party till I just can't party no mo)
Let's take a shot
(Take a shot)
Take a shot
(Take a shot)
Party, I'mma party till I just can't party no mo
(Party, I'mma party till I just can't party no mo)

[Verse 3: Gucci Mane]
Now keep the cameras flashin', we about to shoot a movie
A thick chick let me sip my glass on her booty
She stuck upon my hip and she swear she ain't no groupie
While I'm stuck up in the VIP but everything is all Gucci
So I gathered all the women and we 'bout to take a shot, shot
Goin' out my mind, who's there, nigga, knock, knock
Don't you hear that 808 beatin' down your block, block
Keep the party going cause the party don't stop, stop

[Hook]
P-p-party, I'mma party till I just can't party no mo
(Party, I'mma party till I just can't party no mo)
Party, I'mma party till I just can't party no mo
(Party, I'mma party till I just can't party no mo)
Let's take a shot
(Take a shot)
Take a shot
(Take a shot)
Let's take a shot
(Take a shot)
Take a shot
(Take a shot)
Party, I'mma party till I just can't party no mo
