She broke your heart
And ever since that day boy
You ain't been the same - No
I played my part
Did everything to love you
Thinking you'd change
Baby you got your issues
And I have no regrets
Anything concerning you and me
It was a lesson learned
Gave you my all and this time
I ain't got nothing left
As much as I - wanna love you right now
Ain't the time
So you gotta let it go

Let it go baby
Let it Let it go baby
I know you're hurting
But I don't deserve this
You can't keep loving me one foot outside the door
You need to let it go
Let it go baby

Maybe I was too hard for you
When you said that we were through
Knowing all along how much I need you too
But it's just some things you gotta thug
In this game of love
Oh you hurt me first
Baby you got your issues
And I have no regrets
Anything concerning you and me
It was a lesson learned
Gave you my all and this time
I ain't got nothing left
As much as I - wanna love you right now
Ain't the time
So you gotta let it go

Let it go baby
Let it Let it go baby
I know you're hurting
But I don't deserve this
You can't keep loving me one foot outside the door
You need to let it go
Let it go baby

Oooh woo wooo noooo
Ooooh oooh ooh ooooh
Do do do do

You gotta let it go now (bye bye)
You gotta let it go now (bye bye)
It's over
Let it go Let it go baby
