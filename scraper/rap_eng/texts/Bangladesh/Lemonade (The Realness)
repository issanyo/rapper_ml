Intro- Yo Gucci, you think I can spit on this lemonade beat, I mean I usually don't rap fast. Gucci(Ya) Alright since you approve then heres a little Costco sample

1st verse
First of all let me say I’m the realest
How many rap songs can you let pre schoolers hear this
Sometimes when I rhyme it’s like I’m spittin out brail
Make the whole world feel this
Jumped up on this beat I had to murk this
Woah in other words kill this
You can hear people bumpin my stuff all the way to millis
Had to take a drink of this thing that's  a bit ridiculous
Might put it in a box and give it for someones christamos 
If you never had it, that first sip is very crisp
The taste will hit you in the face like a tyson fist

(Hook) Ice ice lemon-ade
Yo, now put some ice in my lemonade

2nd verse
What about those kids who be outside, all day steady slanging that yellow
They trying to make that money and be balling like that knick Carmello
You can find them posted up on lawns never corners
If you feel a type of way, just brush the dirt of  your shoulder
They making breaking bad profits steady trying to be that lemonade Heisenburg

Prices keep going up and up cho
Inflation go the cost up, about to around a buck yo
For my kid might put it in a sippy cup
Drink too fast, might get a hiccup
Drink too much and you might need a nip tuck
That fam just drank some newmans
Hope wife gets better real soon man
She coming off that flu man

What get it

Mellow Mellow yellow
If I was in Jamaica and I walk up in a room they’d be like Yah Man
When you hear me flow up on this beat looked like sucked a lemon
It’s kinda like I’m a cobra  and I be steady spittin out that venom
Never trip, throw them mitts, lyrically never slip
Too much sugar have you dancing like a go go
For dessert watch my figure might have a fro yo
Been married 9 years got my ring on call me frodo
Good music coming back like a YO YO
When I go back and listen to this track
Gotta say that
I'm on point stay sharper than a thumbtack
This song sounds sweeter than some lemonade
