Chorus:



You said you want that good good all up in ya (woah)



You said you like it fast but you wanna go slow



You said that you taste like strawberries though



You said you can drop it how low I wanna go



V1:

Talkin that talk gon put you in a cute position

Watchin me walk the walk and follow when I give direction it

Ain't no illusion, nigga, I really ain't trippin

Know how to work the cane, simple and plain, I'm on my pimpin



Why you walkin closely when I'm posted in the club

I got that thug love but you gon need to ease up off

I'm focused what the fuck, you gotta know when not to jock

Cause I'm not your lady and you is not my nigga



I know this cookie hella good

And you just wanna tell the hood

Bout how I kill it on the wood

Ain't gotta argue we just do it



You watch it, watch it

While I pop it and roll it

I like it that you want it

But in public just control it



[Chorus]





V2:

Don't stop it, baby pop it

This was just the other night



You was tryna get in my bed but, I  had to catch a flight



Well ya boy is back in town

Let's go for a r-r-r-r-riiiiiide



I'm not talking in my chevy

I'm talking r-r-r-r-riiiight, on me!



---



What's it's gone be?



You wanna be a stylist, for celebrities



I wanna rock wit you, like m. I . K . E



My bed is made for two, call it, super comfy




[Chorus]



V3:



I'm lookin at ya

Baby, I'm looking at ya



Bet you think that you gone hit it and just quit quit quit quit



You won't do that, baby you won't do that.  Cause as you see I am the shit shit shit shit shit shit



You super clever baby you super clever

Why you licking on ya lip lip lip lip lip lip



But if you choose it, baby try not to lose it

I'm a do it real slick slick slick slick quick quick



[Chorus]


Bridge:

You got that good good say!

(repeat)
