[Verse]
Okey dokey I just tricked you like I’m Loki
We can be acquaintances, but don’t you dare call me your homie
Pull me over for a sec but you ain’t gonna tow me
Your shots fired at me I’ma block ‘em like I’m goalie

6 foot 7 foot 8 foot bunch
A cheese bonie banana would be good for lunch
But that'd be too much of one bunch, a bunch like the Bradys
Eat a bag of M&Ms; chika, chika Slim Shady
I’ma send you through the ground
But before you go down
Do me a favor please and say hello for me to Hades

You can never play me
I’m a boss you cannot slay me
Write a few songs, my flow’s on, my flow’s on on the daily
Daily show like Trevor Noah
Spittin’ bars no granola
Your looking kinda thirsty
Take a sip of coca cola

I’m ghosting in Tokyo, looking kinda goulish
I could sometimes be serious but I’d rather be acting foolish
People say that I’m a nuisance
But I’m always in movement
Say something funny and you know that I’m gonna lose it
People always confusing
One rhyme with another
My bars are always fusing
Man I’m hotter than the summer

I'm kicking everybody off the track
I’m not a runner
Hey look, he’s back
Yes it’s daily rapping brother
I’m so fly like I hover
When they ask me how I do it
I say that there’s nothing to it
Probably got it from my mother

I’m fly like a sparrow
Sharp as an arrow
See the future like Raven
I’m quoting Edgar Allen Poe
I’m so sick I got a fever
Medicine don’t overdose
Even if you are a beaver
You can never stop my flow
Yes this is Moses
M, O, S, E, S
En français c’est Moïse
Mais je ne suis pas le prophète, uh

Yes I am bilingual
I am also single
Ladies I got chivalry like knights back in medieval
Or maybe I’m just squire
Who keeps getting inspired
I’ma keep on going and I’ma never get tired, uh

If you gettin’ too tired then I’ma call Mr. Michelin
We could hop on the same track
But you better stay in your own lane
‘Cause we are not the same
You just do it for the fame
My lines are clean
Your bars are dirty like a t-shirt full of stains
You’ve overstayed your welcome
Too bad I cannot help ‘em
I’m always on the grind
You in the studio is seldom

Now I’m about to make it rain
I’m the modder in the game
I’m the king this is my empire
I’ll forever be in rien
If you’re peasant that’s a shame
You only eat uncooked grains
I cannot be hypnotized
I’m the dog that can’t be tamed

I’m not an anime fan but whenever I go super saiyan
Kamehameha not to be confused with Pain
I’m back at it again
Spitting the realest flames
Rappers sound fishy like Nemo
I’m flushing ‘em down the drain
Don’t get in my way
Your crossin’ through my aim
I’m dark at night; you can call me Bruce Wayne

This rap was flattering
This rap was a masterpiece
I am low on energy
I’m running low on battery
This rap was flattering
This rap was a masterpiece
I’m running low on energy
I’m running low on battery
