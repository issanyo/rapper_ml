[Chorus: Kesha]
I don't need you or your brand new Benz
Or your bougie friends
I don't need love looking like diamonds
Looking like diamonds
Get sleazy

[Verse 1: Andre 3000]
We started out so cute in our baby pictures
That mommy shot for our daddy so that he wouldn’t forget you
He forgot anyway, but hey, one day he’ll remember
If not he’s human, I’m human, you human, we’ll forgive him
God gives him his ultimatum, can’t see how momma hates him
He’s such a cool ass guy, then wonder why she date him
I’m only eight, I’m not old enough, guess it’s complicated
Two-parent dwellings and spellings have gotten so underrated
I only say this in cadence so it don't get negated
I was gon' save it for later, but later look like maybe
This crazy lady named Kesha is guessing my Mercedes
Would be all new and through through, but it's the 1980′s
But now that we are cool cool, she sippin’ Irish Baileys
She say “Stacks, you’re true blue?”
I say, "Naw, or maybe..."
I call her Keisha, she like it because it's hood to her
She call me Andre 6000 'cause I’m good to her

[Chorus: Kesha]
I don't need you or your brand new Benz
Or your bougie friends
I don't need love looking like diamonds
Looking like diamonds
I don't need you or your brand new Benz
Or your bougie friends
I don't need love looking like diamonds
Looking like diamonds

[Verse 2: Kesha]
You can't imagine the immensity of the fuck I'm not giving
About your money and manservants at the mansion you live in
And I don't wanna go places where all my ladies can't get in
Just grab a bottle, some boys, and let's take it back to my basement and get sleazy
Sick of all your lines, so cheesy
Sorry, daddy, but I'm not that easy
I'm not gonna sit here while you circle jerk it and work it
I'ma take it back to where my man and my girls is

[Hook: Kesha]
Sleazy, get sleazy, get sleazy, get sleazy, ’cause I'ma get
Sleazy, get sleazy, get sleazy, get sleazy, ’cause I'ma get

[Chorus: Kesha]
I don't need you or your brand new Benz
Or your bougie friends
I don't need love looking like diamonds
Looking like diamonds
I don't need you or your brand new Benz
Or your bougie friends
I don't need love looking like diamonds
Looking like diamonds

[Bridge: Kesha]
Rat-a-tat-tat on your dum-dum drum
The beat's so fat, gonna make me cum (um-um-um...)
Over to your place
(Ah-ah-ah-ah!)
Rat-a-tat-tat on your dum-dum drum
The beat's so fat, gonna make me cum (um-um-um...)
Over to your place
(Ah-ah-ah-ah!)

[Verse 3: Kesha]
I-I-I don't mean to critique on your seduction technique
B-b-but your money's not impressing me, it's kinda weak
Th-th-that you really think you're gonna get my rocks off
Get my top and socks off by showing me the dollars in your drop box
Me and all my friends, we don't buy bottles, we bring 'em
We take the drinks from the tables when you get up and leave 'em
And I don't care if you stare and you call us scummy
'Cause we ain't after your affection and sure as hell not your money, honey

[Chorus: Kesha]
I don't need you or your brand new Benz
Or your bougie friends
I don't need love looking like diamonds
Looking like diamonds
I don't need you or your brand new Benz
Or your bougie friends
I don't need love looking like diamonds
Looking like diamonds

[Outro: Ke$ha]
Rat-a-tat-tat on your dum-dum drum
The beat's so fat, gonna make me cum (um-um-um...)
Over to your place
(Ah-ah-ah-ah!)
Rat-a-tat-tat on your dum-dum drum
The beat's so fat, gonna make me cum (um-um-um...)
Over to your place
