[Intro: Dru Hill]
Wrap your legs around my waist and hold tight... {*echoes*}

[Verse 1: Shawnna + (Ludacris)]
Ayyy, I can make that thang
Go up and down like a rollercoaster
Make it go round and round
'til you make that sound, now let me hold ya
I kinda got somethin to show ya
I really wanna get to know ya
Shawty come and put yo' hands
All on my body like you 'posed to
Yeah, you pop one I'mma pop one too
It ain't no tellin what I'm gon' do
I'mma keep you sayin "Girl you got that good" (you got that good?)
Yeah, I got you screamin "Girl don't quit"
I'll make you ooh, like "Girl that's it"
Now gi-gi-give it to me like you should (like I should?)
Yeah, we can slow it down or speed it up
I love it when you flip it then beat it up
You know them other girls ain't sweet enough
So every time he see me he eat it up
Eat it up, eat it up
Don't slow it down baby keep it up
Keep it up, keep it up
I love it when you make it go deep enough
And I'm so gone I can't hold it in
Now one mo' round, can we go again?
I'm lovin each and every little thing you do
I kinda think I really wanna sing to you
Sing to you, sing to you
You got me in a zone when I think of you
Think of you, think of you
Now baby come and tell me what I need to do

[Hook: Dru Hill]
Wrap your legs around my waist and hold tight (hold tight)
Hold tight (hold tight) cause we're gonna take a ride tonight
Uh, said we're gonna take a ride
Up and down, front to back, side to side
Wrap your legs around my waist and hold tight (hold tight)
Hold tight (hold tight) cause we're gonna take a ride tonight
We're gonna take a riiiiiiiiide
Take a riiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiide tonight

[Verse 2: Ludacris + (Shawnna)]
You got yo' boots, strapped up
And I got my ticket, got my ticket
And I'm ready for the ride of a lifetime
Is you wit it? Is you wit it?
Fasten yo' seatbelt, buckle up
Take two shots, double up
Play this song, pump it up
Then get a little closer, snuggle up
Take yo' time I'mma take my time
Sip a little somethin then relax yo' mind
Let's do it like we never did befo' (did befo'?)
Yeah, I got you screamin "Oh my God"
The headboard hit that wall so hard
Sound like somebody knockin at the do' (at the do'?)
Yeah, keep yo' hands inside the ride
When you up in the air and ridin high
Tonight it's on, I wanna hear you moan
When I put a little kiss inside your thigh
Put a little bass inside your ear
When I whisper and tell you that daddy's here
Daddy's here, the heat is on
And I love you with your little Vickie Secrets on
Even though I'll never let you keep 'em on
Cause you pressed my button and the freak is on
Let's make it a night to remember
And bend that mattress that yo' sheets is on
Sheets is on, yank 'em off
And every little kiss I'mma make 'em soft
Yo' undergarments, take 'em off
Take 'em off so you can

[Hook: Dru Hill]
Wrap your legs around my waist and hold tight (hold tight)
Hold tight (hold tight) cause we're gonna take a ride tonight
Uh, said we're gonna take a ride
Up and down, front to back, side to side
Wrap your legs around my waist and hold tight (hold tight)
Hold tight (hold tight) cause we're gonna take a ride tonight
We're gonna take a riiiiiiiiide
Take a riiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiide tonight

[Interlude]
On a rollercoaster ride
Up, down, front, back, side to side
On a rollercoaster ride
Up, down, front, back, side to side
On a rollercoaster ride
Up, down, front, back, side to side
On a rollercoaster ride
Up, down, front, back, side to side
