Intro:
Just wanna see what we can do-o-o-o
Just wanna spend my time pleasing you-o-o-o

Verse:
You got my attention baby
I wanna make you my lady
Wanna get to know all of you
You know that much is true
No I’m not like them other guys I promise you
Just wanna slow down and get to know the real you
Wanna see if we have some chemistry
Is this true love? It’s a mystery

Pre-chorus:
Baby, let me change your life
I promise you it’ll be alright
Just take my hand, I’ll bring you in the light
Yes I know we just met
We just touched. You just let

Chorus:
Me kiss the scars
Caress your curls, while we watch the stars
I know that you are scared
I see the hurt but, girl I’m prepared
To love you right, love you right
To hold you close, and hold you tight

Verse 2:
This must be fate girl, you and I were destined to meet
And greet, come here girl come and take a seat
Stay for a while, let’s get to know each other
Let’s make each other feel complete
Tell me a secret babe, I’ll tell you mine
Then we’ll kiss near the fireplace and have some wine
You taste so sweet, let me have another taste
You know that baby I won’t let this moment go to waste

Pre-chorus:
Baby, let me change your life
I promise you it’ll be alright
Just take my hand, I’ll bring you in the light
Yes I know we just met
We just touched. You just let

Chorus:
Me kiss the scars
Caress your curls, while we watch the stars
I know that you are scared
I see the hurt but, girl I’m prepared
To love you right, love you right
To hold you close, and hold you tight

Bridge:
Say you wanna be my baby
Say you wanna be my lady
Tell me what you want me to do to you x2

Chorus:
Me kiss the scars
Caress your curls, while we watch the stars
I know that you are scared
I see the hurt but, girl I’m prepared
To love you right, love you right
To hold you close, and hold you tight
