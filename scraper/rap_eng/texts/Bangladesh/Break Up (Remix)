[Intro: Mario]
I love you, but I don't think I can love you anymore
When I kiss you so good
Why would you wanna break up?
When this loving is so good
Why would you wanna break up?
When I hit that so good
Why would you wanna break up?
When this feeling is so good
Why would you wanna break up?

[Chorus: Mario]
Loving you, loving you, loving you
When I'm, when I'm loving you, loving you
Why would you wanna break up? (Do anything for you)
Why would you wanna break up? (See I been driving through your hood)
Why would you wanna break up?

[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]
Now baby girl had dumped me, she no longer wants me
I'm no longer hired, she said that I've been fired
On to the next one, more fish in the sea
Girls are like buses: miss one, next fifteen; one comin'
Gucci Mane crazy and his ice game stuntin'
Swag so stupid still the bitch straight dumped me
Over, no more smokin' doja
Baby girl went AWOL, she used to be my soulja

[Bridge: Mario]
(Don't) Don't I lace you with the Gucci?
(Don't) Don't I deck you in the Louis?
(Do-on't) Don't I make your earlobe freeze?
(Don't) When I dive, I dive deep?
I know I be (gone)
I know I be (gone)
I know I be (flirting wit the girls)
I know I be (saying I'll be right back, but take too long)
I know I be (saying I'll be faithful, but I don't)
I know I be
Making you them promises
Him breaking your heart again
Telling you she wasn't who she was and we arguing
But baby
I love you

[Chorus: Mario]
Loving you, loving you, loving you
When I'm, when I'm loving you, loving you
Why would you wanna break up? (Do anything for you)
Why would you wanna break up? (See I been driving through your hood)
Why would you wanna break up?
Loving you, loving you, loving you
When I'm, when I'm loving you, loving you
Why would you wanna break up? (Do anything for you)
Why would you wanna break up? (See I been driving through your hood)
Why would you wanna break up?

[Verse 2: Sean Garrett]
You might be familiar but to me you're a model
Everything that I e-eva seen in a model
If you leavin' baby don't leave me till tomorrow
Tonight we gone get a lil typsy (with a bottle)
You gone get me up
I'ma take em down
I'ma change my ways
We can work it out
Girl I wouldn't be the same if you was wit somebody else
Girl it wouldn't be the same if I was wit somebody else
I know I made mistakes before
Promise you won't get hurt no more
I got what you like and you know once you lay down it's on

[Chorus: Mario]
Loving you, loving you, loving you
When I'm, when I'm loving you, loving you
Why would you wanna break up? (Do anything for you)
Why would you wanna break up? (See I been driving through your hood)
Why would you wanna break up?
Loving you, loving you, loving you
When I'm, when I'm loving you, loving you
Why would you wanna break up? (Do anything for you)
Why would you wanna break up? (See I been driving through your hood)
Why would you wanna break up?

[Verse 3: Nicki Minaj]
Yep, the Barbie p-p-pushing her Ferrari
You was wilding like safaris now you s-s-sorry
But I'm not listening, not listening, not listenin-ing
Cause I b-b-ball, I got gentlemen whistling
I got the referee making all kind of calls
Cause they be sweating me like NBA player balls
Now you crying, nose all stuffy
I told you, you was lucky, now I'm the bride of Chucky
Nicki!

[Chorus: Mario]
Loving you, loving you, loving you
When I'm, when I'm loving you, loving you
Why would you wanna break up? (Do anything for you)
Why would you wanna break up? (See I been driving through your hood)
Why would you wanna break up?
Loving you, loving you, loving you
When I'm, when I'm loving you, loving you
Why would you wanna break up? (Do anything for you)
Why would you wanna break up? (See I been driving through your hood)
Why would you wanna break up?

[Outro: Mario]
I'm back baby
