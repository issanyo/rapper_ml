[Intro]
I'd like to tell everybody about a city that I love
A city that I call home
A city where winning isnt just expected, its tradition

[Verse]
So with that being said brotha I'm beantown bred
Caps navy and neon red with that capital "B" on our head
For the celtics we bleed green, but in the summer were seen
Sippin lemonade at fenway with a frank topped dijon spread
Over at yawkey way
Out of towners lookin mad when they walk away
Cause their home team just lost the game
We got a winning mindstate, whats left to say?
Can't compare us were not the same
Not even fair man what a shame
Going home with a grimmace, ripped up your round trip tickets
Beause you want to stay
We believed in the bruins brought home the stanley cup
Were loyal fans, so all our teams get that family love
Thats real trust, we have the right to brag present and past tense
Boston always gonna have auerbach, rest in peace red
Best schools, best sports; bad rep? never we got history
Underdogs underrated reason why is like a mystery
Pity on the city thinking that they can compete
Cause every year we got parades that are rolling through our streets
Summertime at the vineyard first you take the ferry
Walk past the obamas, see barack he's rocking sperrys
Playing mini golf, chillin eating ben and jerrys
And if you want it we got it when your shopping on newbury
Small city big heart, tradition here runs deep
Title town usa this is sports country
Home of the prudential tower and harvard
The big dig and the garden
All our teams are champs and yall teams are garbage
Better quit before you start it
Might as well leave us unguarded
Might as well just bench your starters
Welcome to boston
Better quit before you start it
Might as well leave us unguarded
Welcome to BOSTON
