[Intro: Beyoncé]
Uh, uh, uh, uh

Shawty, whatcho name is?

[Pre-Chorus 1: Beyoncé]
Them hustlas keep on talkin'
They like the way I'm walkin'
You saying that you want me?
So press record, I’ll let you film me

[Chorus: Beyoncé]
On your video phone (Make a cameo)
Tape me on your video phone (I can handle you)
Watch me on your video phone (On your video, video)
If you want me, you can watch me on your video phone

[Verse 1: Beyoncé]
I love how you approach me
Fresh white, with your pants, hanging grown man low
Everything you sayin' soundin’ good to me
No need to convince me anymore
Swagger, it's right, one blade is tight
And I smell your cologne in the air
Baby, you doin' somethin' right
You just cancelled every other man here
You say you love my bag, and the color of my nails
You can see that I got it goin' on
I wanna make sure you remember me
So I'm gon' leave my number on your video phone
I got no time for frontin'
I know just what I’m wantin'
If it's gonna be you and me
When I call, they better see me on your video screen

[Pre-Chorus 1: Beyoncé]
Them hustlas keep on talkin'
They like the way I'm walkin'
You saying that you want me?
So press record, I’ll let you film me

[Chorus: Beyoncé]
On your video phone (Make a cameo)
Tape me on your video phone (I can handle you)
Watch me on your video phone (On your video, video)
If you want me, you can watch me on your video phone

[Verse 2: Lady Gaga]
You're my phone star
And I'm happy when my lights flashin'
'Cause you on my receiver
Hubba, hubba
Honey, baby is so sexy that he should win an Oscar
And when you miss me
Just remember that I always got you with me (Oh)
I'll be your Gene, you'll be my Brando
I'mma put you in my movie if you think that you can handle
(Can you handle it?) Whoa

[Bridge 1: Beyoncé]
I know you like that
Turn you into a star, I got it like that
Baby, don't fight it
'Cause when I miss your call, I hit you right back
(On my video phone)

[Pre-Chorus 2: Lady Gaga]
Them hustlas like my fashion (You wanna video me?)
They like the way I'm walkin' (You like what you see?)
You sayin' that you want me (Go on and video me)
So press record, I'll let you film me

[Chorus: Beyoncé & Lady Gaga]
On your video phone (Make a cameo)
Take me on your video phone (I can handle you)
Watch me on your video phone (On your video, video)
If you want me, you can watch me on your video phone

[Bridge 2: Lady Gaga]
Can you handle it?

[Verse 3: Beyoncé]
You know them G's, they be hollerin', 'specially them hot ones

When they see me, they be like "Yo B, let me call you"
You breakin' my focus, boy, you cute and you ballin'
You like it when I shake it?
Shawty on a mission, what your name is?
What? You want me naked?
If you likin' this position you can tape it
On your video phone
Hustla keep on talkin'
You like the way it's poppin'
You sayin' that you want me
Press record and baby, film me

[Chorus: Beyoncé]

Tape me on your video phone (I can handle you)
Watch me on your video phone (On your video, video)
