Remember me? I'm back, I'm who Treshawn Money be
There ain't no alter ego, or any mask to hide up my identity
I got my greens I'm talking cabbage with a side of broccoli
And you know a rapper's savage if they got a first name Emory
Award ceremony, they like, Aye where  Treshawn Money be?
At my crib with EJ's girl, giving her blast of my Sunny D
Cash, game, and fame, he can't talk he got none of these
Forget Kendrick, I got forests filled with hundreds of them Money trees
Such a prodigy, that i came equipped with rings like a binder
I go ham, and yes I'm a muslim, I don't need yalls reminders
Boy, I'm eating, boy I'm grubbin, waiter, where's the plates?
Blowing out the opposition like Preston when he vapes
I'm chill, it's just sorry rappers that I hate
Take it to the field, boy I'll break you, leave you on them skates
1st hit, you're done, you'd fall straight into you casket
End your whole career, just like how I did the last kid
I spit the realest like Chance and Mac high on acid
Boy I'm selfish, just like Kobe, I never pass it
Talking all that smack, but I end with a fast hit
Boy I kept this on the real, YALL faker than some plastic


So EJ Moneyman Mitchem, 1 question, where the money at?
You'd have better luck on YouTube posting videos of some funny cats
Haircut looking a lot like mini Mr. T
No one disagrees
And when I end your career, you'll end up with your own day on the month of Black History
Hair looking crazy, like a freak show, main act of the circus
Put you in the ring, right in the center, like Kendrick Perkins
Your girl reminds me of the ponies, because they let everyone ride her
Probably why one of her favorite drinks are 7 up in cider
Jokes on you, cuz you garbage mixed with a little bit of trash
I'd say you the worst, but your name ain't Yung Sucatash
I'm on a murder spree, so you best watch out Mitchem
Going beast mode on you crew, I guess I Marshawn Lynched em
Dropping bars all across the nation, call me Carrie Nation
Verses so ill, that it's taken ever patient
Boy, it's one hit, and then you done, don't bother saying, "I'm okay"
Hit you so hard, I'd put you sleep, leave you having dreams like MLK
I'm chill, it's just sorry rappers that I hate
All these faggot rappers need me to smack em straight
Seems like no one the planet, appreciates Tre'shawn
EJ thinking he baller, but it takes more than just having J's on
And you didn't think I could do it, but this track is just so Fresh
And it ain't often a black guy gets dissed by a bot from Bangladesh
Heck, I ain't here to lose, I ain't got pity for your whole crew
You're face funny, like comic con, I'm sending kamhamehas like goku

You always walking around with bags, honestly it's kinda creepy
Dissing your whole crew, so I'm versing the NAACP
Boy you never mattered, I'm spitting like  Marshall Mathers, Eminem
Verses so smooth, I'm talking River bed sediment
You playing ball but in graduation day I'll be getting all the letters man
You coulda passed the mic to Micah, but that savage gotta speech impediment
Heck, I'm calling out Collins, You big but I don't know about Suave
Hopefully, the skill of spitting will come to you some day
It could be Sunday, boy the whole crew will need a prayer
They say Tre'shawn running the whole city, but I never ran for mayor
