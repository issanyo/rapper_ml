[Verse 1: Kevin]
That money talk is fluent
Influential presidents all on my mental but you knew this
With the pencil I'm relentless
I go stupid, I'm a nuisance, I'm inventive, no incentives
No excuses, no expenses, bitch I'm on my Kyle Jensen centerfielder to the viewers, front and center to the future fewer niggas make it out when you find out about intruders true, I'm illa' than a patient
Got two hoes and they adjacent
Packed two bowls and now they faded
Talking bout' we elevated, hate it
If you wanna, but um Imma get it how I get it
Fuck you know about the crew
When all we knew was just the business?
Been about it since the clinic, now I'm fly like riding nimbus flying high on Mt. Olympus, god I'm vicious as religion! Christian Bale to Vicki Vale
Just please forgive us for the smell of eucalyptus
Poison Ivy trying to ride me, there go Harley with the fitness
And she grindin' when she split it, she remind me of a gymnast joker bitches want forgiveness
Gotham's gangsta' god of grimace
And my sidekick got the vision, past the present, future villains  I be chillin', reminiscing bout ambition
It's a sickness and I'll kill em with the quickness
Switch the clip up then it's clappin'
Get the slip up, now you slackin'
Smacked a pimp up now I'm trappin' on these niggas
Kev be snappin' on these niggas
Middle finger to the thumb, but um, my index on the trigger little finger to the iron, my appendix isn't finished
But they will remember titans when my story loses interest they will find a peace of mind and then in time they will revisit what they couldn't leave behind
But shit I'm just another witness, listen
Ever since detention I was young with dumb intentions
Trying to find a way to fit in, so I hung out with the "chickens"
Who had turned out to be falcons
Strong enough to move a mountain though
Now my flock is fly enough to pull up unaccounted for
Show up late for shit that we ain't' never been invited to
All the parties private we ignite it when we slidin' through
And we been the shit so keep that paper right behind of you
All we do is c-c-c-c-count like we in private school
That algebra and all these allegations I can't stand it bruh Atlanta cuh', my city on my back, a matter fact
We lit volcanics up, organic flow, I crash it like titanic boats
I'll pass em like mechanic tools, I'm fooling wit hispanic hoes
A fan of enchiladas tho, these niggas want Asada dude
But ya'll don't want no problems
Bitch, I built this from the bottom, screws
All lose and bolts on Roose, I'm trying to float, they wanna cruise but blunts they lit would just canoe
I'm blowing O's up out the U
That HBC, they need to see
My black is fire, my back is beat
The whip of life got skin to bleed
But every night before I sleep I pray up high to heal my grief and then I light another doobie though
Munchies got me smashin'
Scooby snackin' with the looney show
And I got some bitches down to fuck in the jacuzzi though
That booty go like...and then the movies roll
She choosing bro
I can't believe that you conceived with stupid hoes
A baby mama on my anaconda she a floozy though
And if you trying to fire on me I might let that uzi go
Orion got my back like he my pack
Yea that's my Snoopy though
Charlie Brown be hardy on the ground
That shit is soothing though
Imma take off, niggas flake off
Situations they don't gain from let em shake off
Bring the pain on, killed the same song
As the trap god, niggas act hard
But they soft serve, like the ice cream on the mane face
You a crossword with a game face
Imma crossbow, you a lost soul
In a swamp hole, with the same fate
As a tadpole, I'm a flagship, you a flagpole in the same lake wave the flag hoe, like you hang bait
You bad show, I'm a great play
Bout' to fast forward to the mane stage
Left my passport on the same plane
Said I'm fly bitch, let the name reign
