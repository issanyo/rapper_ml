[Intro: Tom Lehrer]
Every evening you will find him around our neighborhood
It's the old dope peddler doing well by doing good
(Shawty get them kids out the street!)

[Hook]
Started off with a OZ
End up riding fo' deep
Pull up to that club like motherfucking ho you don't know me
I said I pull up to that club like motherfucking ho you don't know me
Started off with a OZ
End up riding fo' deep
Started off with a OZ
End up riding fo' deep
Pull up to that club like motherfucking ho you don't know me

[Verse 1]
I said I pull up to that club like motherfucking ho you don't know me
Most of my niggas got gold teeth
Most of my bitches got tattoos
Most of my niggas think cash rules
And I mess up hairdo's like it's a pair of shoes
And I need a parachute when I'm up there
I'm in the trap cuz I work there

[Hook]
Started off with a OZ
End up riding fo' deep
Pull up to that club like motherfucking ho you don't know me
I said I pull up to that club like motherfucking ho you don't know me
Started off with a OZ
End up riding fo' deep
Started off with a OZ
End up riding fo' deep
Pull up to that club like motherfucking ho you don't know me

[Interlude]
When the shades of night are falling
Comes a fellow everyone knows
It's the old dope peddler spreading joy wherever he goes
(Let me take my shades off a little (...) See what these bitches looking like!)

[Verse 2]
See what these bitches looking like
Stick in all crooked like
Louie V is my Kryptonite
Take your bitch and I give her back
Give her this and I give her that
Fine wine and lobster tail
Candle light and Chrisette Michele
Look at the pussy and play kiss and tell
Fix her hair then fix her nails
Even pay a few bills
Way I'm running shit man I should have a shoe deal
And my whole crew ill
Pockets on Fatburger
Going so hard you'd think I mixed a Viagra with a Soda
Staying focused, this yola here
Black and white ice: polar bear
You hold her hand and I hold her hair
I pull her close and put it there

[Hook]
Started off with a OZ
End up riding fo' deep
Pull up to that club like motherfucking ho you don't know me
I said I pull up to that club like motherfucking ho you don't know me
Started off with a OZ
End up riding fo' deep
Started off with a OZ
End up riding fo' deep
Pull up to that club like motherfucking ho you don't know me

[Outro: Tom Lehrer]
When the shades of night are falling
Comes a fellow everyone knows
It's the old dope peddler spreading joy wherever he goes
