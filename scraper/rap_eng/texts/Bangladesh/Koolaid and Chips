[Verse]
I use to drink Koolaid and Sprite by the two liter
Eat some Fritos, holding on to pee
That's a summer free, play Super Smash Bros
Slap and attack foes, I'm Falcon Punching these hoes
Now let's get going, let go it
We group with Thomas the train, and more black shit
Just cause in the game, I still love family
Sending and getting we used to playing on our system
And I win, then we play again kill shit
Kingpin with a pen, and I pent, when I sin
We always go over specific events
He used to and still play fight with me
And I always win, but really the deal is
I'm getting off topic, me and him both
We eat food so sloppy, we are the same
I'd be talking about rap and shit
And we try to copy
Low pants, riding bikes to the convenient store
Man, I love my little brother bro
We be doing shit normal niggas is weak
Get to the edge of the seat
We are complete, he know I love em, and he love me, so...

[Hook]
We sending and getting, we came to win it
My nigga we came to pillage, just me and lil villain
Niggas confused, get out ya daze it's just time for us niggas
My best friend, eating chips and koolaid by the liter [x2]
