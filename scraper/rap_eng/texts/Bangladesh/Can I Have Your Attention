I say, can I have your attention?
Fuck that, when you hear me talk, you better listen
I’m on the money making mission
Snakes in the grass got a young nigga tripping

[Verse 1]
Usually I don’t give a fuck
But I been feeling like who the fuck can I trust
When a nigga broke he do whatever for the buck
And I’m getting money so I keep my nine tucked
I got niggas plotting on me, keep that Glock up on me
Hella guap up on me, no you not my homie
I could get you shot up homie, and they ain’t gon find out
Bring them 45s out, every time I ride out
Try to come in my house, leave you inside out
We got choppers with 50 clips, and we be killing shit
Murder the witnesses, anybody could get this shit man
Ain’t nobody innocent, if I start it I finish it

[Hook][x2]

[Verse 2]
I try and talk to em but, I don’t think they hear me though
Watch for the snakes in the grass nigga, really though
Especially when a nigga on the verge of making plenty dough
Informants tryna get in and see what Bibby on
Then they try to plant seeds all in your head
Got a nigga going crazy, man I think I need some meds
These type of niggas be worse than the feds
Like I got an opportunity for us to get some bread
They smile in your face, lying to your face
You just got to read between the lines of what they say
Insult my intelligence, who they think they effing with?
Fuck around, catch you out and let this MAC 11 spit
