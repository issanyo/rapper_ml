I know you sayin' somethin', what?
I can't hear you
You talkin' 'bout nothin', what?
I can't hear you

See you need to change the subject, what?
I can't hear you
If you ain't talkin' money
I ain't really tryna hear you

Oh, oh, talkin' out the side of your neck
Oh, oh, talkin' out the side of your neck
Oh, oh, talkin' out the side of your neck

They like wait, wait, now you can't do that yet, what?
They don't got cashed dollar they got another check, what?
And we don't got the room keys
And I think the girl out to the movies

You can keep it pimpin' dog
My piece and my girl get to rippin' y'all
You he got white, he got green, he got piece
If you ain't talkin' money then you talkin' Chinese

I know you sayin' somethin', what?
I can't hear you
You talkin' 'bout nothin', what?
I can't hear you

See you need to change the subject, what?
I can't hear you
If you ain't talkin' money
I ain't really tryna hear you

Oh, oh, talkin' out the side of your neck
Oh, oh, talkin' out the side of your neck
Oh, oh, talkin' out the side of your neck
Oh, oh, talkin' out the side of your neck

We ain't gettin' money, you niggas talkin' crazy
We shippin' out, shippin' in, gettin' it in daily
Keep a main hustla and a tax writer successful with the rap
But I still get the white off

Monkey ass niggas talkin' all crazy
Ain't talkin' money so none of y'all phase me
I'm gettin' mine in, watchin' mine stack up
You need to do the same thing and cut your small [Incomprehensible]

I know you sayin' somethin', what?

You talkin' 'bout nothin', what?
I can't hear you

See you need to change the subject, what?
I can't hear you
If you ain't talkin' money
I ain't really tryna hear you

Oh, oh, talkin' out the side of your neck
Oh, oh, talkin' out the side of your neck
Oh, oh, talkin' out the side of your neck
Oh, oh, talkin' out the side of your neck

I get it in, I'm a hustla I get hella pain
Talkin' out the side of your neck
Check, check the resume
I ain't yappin' for my [Incomprehensible]
Call me chest aroma, I ain't chappin' for my health

I'm a gangsta, I'm a goon straight thug nigga
He a murderer, a menace, he a drug dealer for real
I know they sayin' somethin' 'bout me
But if they ain't talkin' money
It ain't nothin' 'bout me

I know you sayin' somethin', what?
I can't hear you
You talkin' 'bout nothin', what?

I mean what I say, say what I mean
I ain't tryna hear you unless your conversation green
So keep quiet, better yet keep your mouth closed
Act like Janet, dang got your mouth froze

You hear presidents seein' dollar signs
Here we can converse that's the bottom line
Money on my mind and nothing else
If you ain't talkin' money
Shit, you talkin' to yourself

I know you sayin' somethin', what?
I can't hear you
You talkin' 'bout nothin', what?
I can't hear you

See you need to change the subject, what?
I can't hear you
If you ain't talkin' money
I ain't really tryna hear you

Oh, oh, talkin' out the side of your neck
Oh, oh, talkin' out the side of your neck
