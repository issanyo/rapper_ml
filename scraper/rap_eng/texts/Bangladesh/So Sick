[Verse 1]
I'm sick 'cause it's 4 in the morning
And I'm sick 'cause I ain't heard from him
I done seen this flick before
G-g-g-gave him plenty warning
He said he wouldn't do it again
You know my heart keeps telling me it's gon' stop
Now there's a knock but the dead bolts lock
(My-my-my conscious saying)
You can do better girl
'Cause right now he ain't ready
But the other side of my head side is saying
That I might not find no better
So when he ask just how could you love somebody so
This feeling this question I asked still been unanswered
But is so, so many, yyeah

[Chorus]
Sick when you take him back every time
'Cause the love is so amazing
And it makes you so sick
When it makes you go and compromise
Everything you said the night before
You wouldn't do ooh
Sick when you love him more than you love yourself
You can't let go 'cause you just can't help it
'Cause the only left to do is cry
'Cause deep inside it makes you so sick, oh
Don't sometimes it makes you so sick?
Don't sometimes it makes you so sick?

[Verse 2]
Of course hes calling me it's 8:10 (in the morning)
But I ain't gon' be late for work again (I can't afford this)
I'm pulling off he pulls up (pulls up)
There's something he wanna discuss
I'm telling him last night I was all ears
But he was no where to be found
Told him last time that he made me feel this way
I wasn't gon be the one going back on my word
I was just gon let it end
'Cause obviously conversing ain't working for me and you
Now I'm back home in the bed missing the hell out of you

[Chorus]
Sick when you take him back every time
'Cause the love is so amazing
And it makes you so sick
When it makes you go and compromise
Everything you said the night before
You wouldn't do ooh
Sick when you love him more than you love yourself
You can't let go 'cause you just can't help it
'Cause the only left to do is cry
'Cause deep inside it makes you so sick, oh
Don't sometimes it makes you so sick?
Don't sometimes it makes you so sick?

[Bridge:]
Oh, how far, can you tell me, how far
Does someone have to push you for them to recognize
They pushed you over the line, the line, the line?
Baby, how far? Baby, how far
Do you think I'm gonna let you push me
Before I cross the line
Before I cross the line?

[Chorus]
I'm sick when you take him back every time
'Cause the love is so amazing
And it makes you so sick
When it makes you go and compromise
Everything you said the night before
You wouldn't do ooh
Sick when you love him more than you love yourself
You can't let go 'cause you just can't help it
'Cause the only left to do is cry
'Cause deep inside it makes you so sick, oh
Don't sometimes it makes you so sick?
Don't sometimes it makes you so sick?
