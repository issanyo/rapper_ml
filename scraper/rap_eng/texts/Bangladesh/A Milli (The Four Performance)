[Verse: Dylan Jacob]
Fresher than my sneakers, let's play follow the leader
I feel like a cheater
Shoot, my scores would pass the teacher
That's why I'm back in The Four
If you take me off, put a tag on the toe
Guess my rapping is cold, but I gotta stand up, even back of the pole
I tackle a show, just to come back and show I got what, like, half of you don't, I'm Imaginables
I really need this
I know the gloves off, so my hands get exposed
I gotta make a lot to be a millionaire
These rappers, they soft like they from Build-A-Bear
They say, "We're like killer"
I say, "Winner, where?"
So don't tell me to be mean, come and check out my demeanor
I need to take a seat, 'cause this where the grass look greener
That Justin Bieber, little, white boy, got a mad flow
Why you mad for?
We'll never tell fully, yeah
We both just some teens, but imagine what I'd be if I had a Jermaine Dupri (no shade)
I feel like they don't take me serious
Might be delirious
Give me the headlights, I'll get my bread right
Right on the premonished
I wouldn't be shady, I'm in the wool, why?
You act like a sheep, see?
I am evolved from what you have seen
I know my stomach looks full, but I paid for buffet
And I'm here to eat, ahh!
