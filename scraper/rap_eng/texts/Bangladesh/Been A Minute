Oh la la Bangladesh

[Verse 1: Sevyn Streeter]
Since he ain't been with me
I ain’t thinking 'bout him at all, uh uh
Called it quits, picked up my shit
I ain't look back, ain't nothing to be sad for, uh uh
Just one of those things when you know it’s over
Better walk away, no reason to hold on, oh
Boy, it's easy to be off you
I don't see you, I don't call you
But then you call me, oh damn

[Chorus: Sevyn Streeter]
Been a minute since you call me, call me, call me, call me
Call me, call me
Been a minute since we got naughty, naughty, naughty, naughty
Naughty, naughty
Been a minute since my body, body, body, body
Been on your body, body
Been a minute since all that, oh yeah
And I think I might want that back

[Verse 2: August Alsina & Sevyn Streeter]
Do you know it, do you think
We should try you and me again
Or should we just stay friends?
Fuck every now and then?
It's been a minute since I called you
Saying you should fall through
For a little private party
How you grindin' your body all over my body
I'm sorry
Some days, I wish I could go back to
Erase all the games and bullshit I put you through
And other times, I'm thinking
Easy to be off you
I don't see you, I don't call you
Then you call me, oh damn

[Chorus: Sevyn Streeter]
It's been a minute since you call me, call me, call me, call me
Call me, call me
Been a minute since we got naughty, naughty, naughty, naughty
Naughty, naughty
Been a minute since my body, body, body, body
Has been on your body, body
Been a minute since all that, oh yeah
And I think I might want that back

[Bridge: Sevyn Streeter & August Alsina]
I don't know if I wanna keep you
Or if I just wanna touch you
I'm not sure if I wanna tie you down and fuck you
Or if I just wanna say, "Fuck you"
(All that bullshit that you did to me)
(All that bullshit that you did to me)
Oh, I think I want that old thing back
Oh, I really love it how you do me like that
Shit, goddamn, got me so confused
Shit, goddamn, I don't want nothing new
Now you on my phone
How you even know that I was all alone
Kinda got somebody else up in my zone
I'm just playing, but I'm saying
Boy, what took you so long?

[Chorus: Sevyn Streeter]
It's been a minute since you call me, call me, call me, call me
Call me, call me
Been a minute since we got naughty, naughty, naughty, naughty
Naughty, naughty
Been a minute since my body, body, body, body
Been on your body, body
Been a minute since all that, oh yeah
And I think I might want that back
