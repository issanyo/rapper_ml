[Verse 1]
( Had to pull up like ) Had to pull up like
Skrrrt
Swervin' almost hit the curb
Had to get it out the dirt
You can see it on my shirt
Now these bitches wanna flirt
Have them lifting up they skirt
She popped a molly go berserk
And then I made that lil' bitch twerk

[Hook]
Skrrrt  x7

[Verse 2]
Had to pull up like an exercise
Fashion killer it's a genocide
Underdogs we not undersized
Grab your bitch, She look hypnotized
She foreign I'm counting my yen
She's feening she calling her friends
I keep it a hundred like Ben
Had to pull off in a Benz
Skrrrt Skrrrt!

[Verse 3]
( Had to pull up like )
I just Skrrt pulled off in a foreign whip, Hey
I just left the club with a foreign bitch, Hey
I just flew her overseas that's a foreign trip, Hey
Got this Vodka in my wine glass it's a foreign sip, Hey (Aw)
She threw that ass back and made me lean (Woah)
All my bitches buy Celine (Oh yeah)
Jewelry shining like a beam
The clothes I'm wearing I'm freshest on the scene
Thousand dollars on my jeans
You can't hang out with the team
Ballin' on you like the Kings

(Original Beat fades In)
