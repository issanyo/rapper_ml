[Verse 1: Rihanna]
Baby, you don't need to be scared of me, I guarantee that I'm not a mistake
I'ma give you all of my love and I hope that you won't misplace it
You created this shit, going insane with all of this fear
Can't turn my back on it, I'm in love, I gotta face it

[Verse 2: Chris Brown]
You're the only one I wanna stay on the phone with
Ooh, the late night Skype sex, on that young shit
Girl, you keep it one hunnid, always gon' hold me down
You know you're the number one, girl, I'ma work you out

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Brown & Rihanna]
Ain't got much to say, I ain't about to make you wait
I'm just gon' take you from here, girl, let's ride away
Let's elevate, just elevate
Yeah, girl, let me take you for a ride

[Chorus: Chris Brown & Rihanna]
Baby, let me change your life, promise it will be alright
Baby, take my hand tonight, let me set you free now
Sweating like a waterbed on me, keep putting that thang on me
Like you never did before, I'm gon' explore all of your body
Put it up right there, right there, right there, right there
Put it up right there, I'm gon' explore all of your body
Put it up right there, put it up right there, I love, I love you
I'm gon' explore all of your body

[Verse 3: Chris Brown & Rihanna]
I'ma write my name with my tongue on your back, baby
Come on, just let me, I know you're ready
And even if there is a crowd, let 'em see it
I'ma give you some more
Just let 'em all just say what they wanna say, that's how I feel, 'cause I'm in love
And the temperature just heats up when I'm with you
Don't be scared, when I start to go down and I lick you
Rubbing and kissing and licking on your body when I go down and oh I'm gon' miss you
And I need your body right now 'cause I know it's an issue
And I'm hyperventilating right now, I can't breathe, if I ain't with you
I need your body like right now, I need your body like right now
Lay your head, on my bed, baby, tell me if you want the lights down
Your property, treat me like I'm your property
Do what you wanna, take command, I'm about to be your biggest fan
Your property, treat me like I'm your property
Do what you wanna, take command, I'm about to be your biggest fan

[Chorus: Chris Brown & Rihanna]
Baby, let me change your life, promise it will be alright
Baby, take my hand tonight, let me set you free now
Sweating like a waterbed on me, keep putting that thang on me
Like you never did before, I'm gon' explore all of your body
Put it up right there, right there, right there, right there
Put it up right there, I'm gon' explore all of your body
Put it up right there, put it up right there, I love, I love you
I'm gon' explore all of your body

[Bridge: Rihanna & Chris Brown]
Looking for too many places
Searching high and low for you, I'm stronger when I'm close to you
I'm seeing all familiar faces
Girl, it's all about you, only you in my life
And I say, "You like playing with my heart?"
Baby, please don't do this to me
'Cause I'm in love, can I get a little bit?
One more kiss? Yeah 'cause I don't wanna miss it

[Chorus: Chris Brown & Rihanna]
Baby, let me change your life, promise it will be alright
Baby, take my hand tonight, let me set you free now
Sweating like a waterbed on me, keep putting that thang on me
Like you never did before, I'm gon' explore all of your body
Put it up right there, right there, right there, right there
Put it up right there, I'm gon' explore all of your body
Put it up right there, put it up right there, I love, I love you
I'm gon' explore all of your body
