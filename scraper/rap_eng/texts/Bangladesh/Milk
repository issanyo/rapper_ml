[Verse 1: Julian Marshall]
Please stop asking to see my plans cause I'm fucking done
I'm staying in my room I need some Vitamin D and some Sun
Hand a bladder to a pasture ask where all the doubters from
I'll break them done to dust without a punch just cause swag and fun
Anger to the third degree cause I can never find the sum
I'm making matters worse until America is full of bums
People think I'm different which is good but kinda dumb
Because they're crying while lying to lions I'm the rising son
Let your mom tell us who can fucking last longer
I'm the rap starter, bad baller, FloWolf swag's father
Need friends, I'm fucking starving, I need to barter
A couple that I had but know longer like your daughter
If you come up to me just ask if it's comforting
To here these different thoughts because I like to rap not to sing
I've tried about everything but it's funny I act stupidly
Because I'm pretty smart but I act kind of nervously
Intelligence is high but unknown so it's never seen
I'm sky high I think I'll die so please have sympathy
Get up out the crib cause you're acting like a baby
I'm in the sewers chirping soon in skyscraper's maybe

[Verse 2: The Don]
Imma splitter splatter eat some eggs snort some powder for an hour then I shower showing off my Irish power
Ladies flower fowler then a bunch of nazi hoes and my bro's got Flow never heard of now you know
Gonna scritcha scratcha batcha snatch and down the hatch and breaking rules and breaking fools who run up acting just like tools
Tools which I use to fix up my Subbie and rudely tell your girlfriend to suck my dick then she screwed me
Fuck with the cats we're starting to meow annoyingly little brother swaggin' out Holding down the legacy
Which I drive 55 rollin' down Main Street
Dover NH at Mickey D's that's where I'll be
Analytical political lyrical monster tearing down your house murder rents now you are a foster
And the home for imaginary kinda hairy more then scary larry sippin' on some fucking dairy
Thats Milk, ass milk, ask Wilt, I'm like silk and my flow is so fucking cold you'll need about 15 quilts
Spit my game and talk my shit puff the cheeb then i split
Recommit, I hit fit
I hit brit clit but it smelt like shit
Swaggin' out like Brad Pitt hard to admit isn't it
Imma go hard and bombard these bars while I'm winning this shit ace low face card
Front yard porch swinging rappin' shit not singin'
J. M. is Charlie Sheen tiger blood and he'll keep winning
