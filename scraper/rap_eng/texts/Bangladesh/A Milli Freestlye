A million views
A million screws
Plus a million reasons
I am me not you
Access to that boom boom
You know just what to do
Make you hollow
Make you follow them
Helium balloons
I am born and bred British
Cafe breakfast
Full English no pork
That's not the righteous way of living
Learnt that some rasta bredrin they wanna follow
Where I'm heading
They used to diss my head now
I'm the head lining act
Motherfucker fancy that
If I tap ya yat she'll never take you back
That's that
No commas
No semi-colons
No reasons
No explanations
They ask why the senior did
But you hearing the explanation
The future that's in the present
The best of all Christmas present
Since I am chipmunk the album
Believe me
Don't fucking doubt him

Motherfucker I'm skilled

(Verse 2)

I'm the reason why you can't get a looking
Ask Fash about my schedule for booking
I've done did what you couldn't
Constant confident
That's everything that you isn't
I can make a deaf kid wanna listen
Nigga listen
I ain't on that Wiley shit
I always turn up
They only get booked when Mr Munk
Can't turn up
These fairy liquid odours are washed up
Take a peak nigga, i'm washed up
What's up now what's up
What the problem is
Problem kid.com
Forward slash the reasons
The others have no confidence
Every lyric that leaves my lips
Is monstrous
I spit it ugly
They still love me
I'm so comfy
Sofa seated
Christians are blaspheming
Hear me and the lords name their screaming
Oh Jesus
These premature lyricists need to leave him
Don't compare a Chipmunk
To a fetis
It's not even
Wait
And now this music shit is payin me
I find it ironic that my ex thinks
She should stay with me
And so does my other ex
And my other ex
Fuck a wifey
I don't want another ex
I'm over stressed
Preeing everybody's movements
But it's hard when
Nobody's moving
I am not losing
I am winning I've won
Who's a done
I'll have him done
Chipmunk chameleon
I'm done
BLAARGH
