[Hook]
A million here and a million there
I’ll scream that when I’m a millionaire
Cuz that’s the lifestyle that I’m chasing
So much money it’s just not fair

[Verse]
The future, I see it
The way that being
The cars that I’m driving
Right down your street
I’m a menace when I spit into a mic and tear it up
You would wonder what’s in my red solo cup
Chill out grown ups, it’s just sprite
Everything’s gone be alright
I still spit bars that go out of site
That fire burning way to bright
I spit so much fire it’s unreal
They say chill, take a pill
Rhymes so ill, they could kill
Like I got a burnin grill
Chasin bills, I want mills
Stack them higher than a hill
With rhymes to trill, you know the deal, turn up the bass so you can feel
The beat hit harder
Murder any other beat on Tha Carter III
It’s a part of me to just go off
Rhymes go opposite of soft
Sorry to slow the flow down
Should I pick it up a little bit more now?
Got 'em higher than a kite that’s flyin a million feet from the ground
A milli, a millionaire
Is what I will be
Think I’m silly? Hah
Well then you must just really not feel me
Think that I’m playin? You out of your mind
Only if you really knew my grind
Only if you’d see my bank account, you’d question if it’s mine
Ion got a milli, but it’s climbin
Swimming in the money, like Nemo, except even Marlin can’t find me
Money make me cheese, I don’t mean what’s in lasagna
Women of my dreams, ion sleep so I can’t find her
I ain’t like these other rappers, no I’m way different
I know I’m the greatest no matter how much credit you give me
I will die remembered
My name gone live on forever
When this mixtape dropped, a heat front’s all you gone see in the weather
Whether you like me or not, you just cannot resist it
And if you wanna throw shots, you gone wish you never dissed it
If you thinking about it, I advise you to mind your business
Witness, the greatness when I spit this, b**ches
Tell me watch my mouth and I ain’t even say the word
If you heard, I said beaches, but you can’t because it’s blurred
Now that I have raised your eyebrows and got your attention
You won’t leave the song, you’ll stay to hear the rest I mention
Just when you were getting bored, I pull you right back in this
Get bored of me? No, not by the hair of my chinny chin chin
Banger after banger, yea, you know thats all I drop
I won’t ever stop
Gotta problem? Run up, and get popped
Like a fire cracker
It’s the Mr. Money stacker
Stacking green like bay packers
I'm in my zone like a linebacker
Getting cash like bank hacker
Already know haters testing me, but don't mess with me, cause I'm the best you see
Give it less than a week, and I’ll already have your girl texting me
I’m a beast on the mic, take a beat, and I feast on it, right, not the best, but the least that I write, still fire, burn anybody my brain sees in the sight, no peace, man a freezer could tease with it, right?
I’ll burn it down
And they may think that I’m playing around
Till they hop in the whip, try to head to the store and they hear this all through the town
I’m an unstoppable monster
Try to get your girl back, too bad you’ve already lost her
You ain’t crap but she know I’m fly like a helicopter
You ain’t nothing, see, I’m something, but you think I’m nothing,till I break you like humpty dumpy yup
You heard it right I’ll break you like an egg
Or I’ll drop the diss track right on your head instead
You may think you can do better
You can hate cuz I’m the great
Or you can talk to me after you kill a beat from ‘08
Fi-fi-five years earlier, mom brought a legend to the planet
I’m a monstrous beast, Incase you still don’t understand it
Mother effer I’m ill, not sick
And I’m flying to the top spot like a drop kick
Gotta problem I’ll snap you in half like a chopstick
(Like a chopstick, like a chopstick, like a chopstick, like a chopstick)

[Hook]
A million here and a million there
I’ll scream that when I’m a millionaire
Cuz that’s the lifestyle that I’m chasing
So much money it’s just not fair
