[Verse 1: Keke Palmer]
Imma get you dancing, spinning slowly
I'm on it and I know it
You scoping and I notice
So don't stop there
Smoking, lights are glowing
I'm dizzy, losing focus
Baby, I can tell you want it
So don't stop there, give it to me

[Hook]
Rock my body, rock my body
Drive me crazy
Music started, a moving target
You're eyes on me
One thing on my mind tonight
Grab my girls, hit the floor, good times
So let's get it, get it

[Chorus]
It's a party, party every night
Everybody, body, let's get light
Ohhh Ahh, Let's dance
Ohhh Ahh, let's dance
Follow my lead, RIDE THIS BEAT
Come on, baby Follow my lead, make you RIDE THIS BEAT
Feel that heat, baby, RIDE THIS BEAT
And we'll keep going, going, going
Dancing until morning comes

[B.o.B]
The way that you moving, I find it conducive
Or even elusive at times
Baby, I'll follow your lead if you show me the blueprint
Something only you could design
She coming down, yup gripping that wood
She know what to do with the pine
You know what they say
If looks can kill, you've committed too many crimes
There it go, there it go
Don't play, let it go, let it go
Ain't no telling where we end up, late night
And really you'll never know, never know
And we'll ride that beat like a 'Rari
Baby girl, look what you started
This ain't my phone that you're feeling
Guess who just came to the party? Me!
I can arrive for one hundred miles away
All of your problems and worries are carried away
Don't get too caught up in heaven and all at once
In order to grow, you gotta have negative space
You just need someone to help you maneuver the maze
Teach you to press on the gas instead of the breaks
Hearts are often like glass, but never they break
But that was the past, and this is the present mistake

[Chorus]
It's a party, party every night
Everybody, body, let's get light
Ohhh Ahh, Let's dance
Ohhh Ahh, let's dance
Follow my lead, RIDE THIS BEAT
Come on, baby Follow my lead, make you RIDE THIS BEAT
Feel that heat, baby, RIDE THIS BEAT
And we'll keep going, going, going
Dancing until morning comes

[Verse 2: Keke Palmer]
Turn it up
This my shhh, This my shhh
It ain't loud enough
Make me feel it inside of me
Don't play no games with me, boy, please
Don't be scared, pull me close
When you do that thing right there
Hasting but I'm ready
When you rub my body, run your body
If you're working on getting me started
Then I'm working on leaving this party

[Chorus]
It's a party, party every night
Everybody, body, let's get light
Ohhh Ahh, Let's dance
Ohhh Ahh, let's dance
Follow my lead, RIDE THIS BEAT
Come on, baby Follow my lead, make you RIDE THIS BEAT
Feel that heat, baby, RIDE THIS BEAT
And we'll keep going, going, going
Dancing until morning comes
