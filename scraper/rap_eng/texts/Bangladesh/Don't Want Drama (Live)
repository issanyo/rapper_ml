[Verse 1: 8Ball]
Straight from the underground, fat boy from the Mound
Spit it how I live it, keep it gutter, that's how we get down
I wanna see you get it crunk, let a nigga know what hood you from
Everybody with me drunk as fuck, break it down, then roll it up
Back it up, a girl like you, a nigga like me can't pass it up
Rollin' by, lookin' good, put it in reverse then back it up
What's the deal, let me make it clear, what you got right here
They broke the mold, one of a kind, fat boy with a gold mouth that shine
Hard to touch, sorry to tell, these boys out here ain't hard as us
Ball and G, part of the streets, 'cause the streets are a part of us
Lay it down, please remember, games, we don't play them now
Disrespect, please remember, stains, we gon' spray them round

[Chorus]
Bust a nigga head, smack a ho, shoot the club up
Bust a nigga head, smack a ho, shoot the club up
Bitch, nigga, bitch, nigga, bitch, nigga, bitch
You don't want drama, you don't want none
You don't want drama, you don't want none

[Verse 2: MJG]
Get up (Get up), Get crunk (Get crunk)
Let's race to the trunk (To the trunk)
Get a pump, unload and dump
Fuck kid, he chose to jump
In the middle of a fire, scratch and burn him, let's overheat him
Really mistreat him, let's Rodney King him and overbeat him
MJG is the reason your season needed season
Your spices, they needed more life and lucky your wife was bleedin'
Now your life is leavin' your body, for drinkin' too much Bacardi
You should've known when you started, never fuck with G
In any climate I'm shinin', 'cause I'm perfect with timing
I'm good for rippin' and rhymin' in and out the beat
And 8Ball is loadin' the clip, for niggas supposin' to trip
And you know I'm rollin' the whip, we finna set 'em free

[Chorus]
Bust a nigga head, smack a ho, shoot the club up
Bust a nigga head, smack a ho, shoot the club up
Bitch, nigga, bitch, nigga, bitch, nigga, bitch
You don't want drama, you don't want none
You don't want drama, you don't want none
