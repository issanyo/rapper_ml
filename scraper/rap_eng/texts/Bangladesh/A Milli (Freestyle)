[Intro]
So I'm supposed to say some corny ish?
Haha, nah
Uh, yessir
It be that, it be that

[Verse]
It be that Breezy millionaire
A milli here and a million there
Sellin' out stadiums, million chairs
Steppin' on and off stage, killin' 'em
I got a million pair of them all white a million Airs
I am a beast, hurry competition, come please
Lock 'em up, lock 'em up
Just put 'em on freeze, on ice
I'm doin' things that rappers don't like
And I'm makin' a milli, a milli, a milli
And I'm makin' a milli, a milli
Gettin' money, just throw it up and watch it
And when it comes down, it's like magnets in my pockets
Damn, I got it
Purple and green diamonds, they swing from my chest
Bigger and bigger, man, I think the Hulk's on my neck
I'm brilliant, Jay-Z, Weezy, Breezy
So what's a million? Yeah

[Outro]
Singing niggas is just chill
Haha
'Cause I'm ill
