(Bridge)
Ray Charles, Ray Bans
Shades on, I don’t see niggas
Pull up front in that what’s her name
Call it that’s more than 6 figures
Fix your face, get your bitch
Get in line, we going straight in
Buying bottles, 2 cigars
At the bar I don’t see er

(Hook)
I’m Ray Charles to these haters
Charles to these haters
Charles to these haters
Charles to these haters
I’m Ray Charles to these haters
Charles to these haters
Charles to these haters
Charles to these haters
My shades on, my wrist right
Shades on, my bitch right
Shades on, I don’t see niggas
Pull up front in that whip right
I’m Ray Charles to these haters
Charles to these haters
Charles to these haters
Charles to these haters

(Verse 1)
I’m in the V12, you in the V6
Brains blowed, you can’t see shit
Hate with me, might see fish
Stop at the light get sea sick
Instagram, take a couple pics
Got a couple blunts, we extend shit
Can’t see you niggas like Ray Charles
But I keep an eye open like Slick Rick
Bottles poured, bitches choosin
She locked up and got fucked up
Them niggas hate, just let em hate
We got more food on a bigger plate
Can’t see you niggas like Ray Charles
Yea, I’m on my Stevie
Got a bad bitch on my Jackson
Like Mike Tito and Reeby
No roof, Ray Bans
Limo tint, I can’t see you niggas
New chick, Rainman
That’s retarded though, I slam Murcielago dose
That Oprah money, that Harpo flow
Will Fargo that papa tho
That make a beat for them Carter folk
That scratching when I light it up

(Hook)

(Verse 2)
I’m a hustler in grind mode
My watch got a couple time zones
Blow trees til they pine cones
Make a thousand beats with my eyes closed
Don’t see you niggas, got em blindfold
Take yo bitch on a blind date
Haters drunk at a wine taster
They start giving me fuck faces
These lame niggas can’t see em
My shades on, I can’t see em
My new car got a passport
My whips all European
Can’t see you niggas, glaucoma
And they keep the Glock on em
I treat my bitch like my whip
I never keep the top on er
Ray Charles, Ray Bans
A nigga ballin like Ray Lewis
A nigga ballin like Ray Allen
Don’t see you when the money pilin
Spent 3000 just to sip a gallon, just to piss in stylin
Semi-automatic with the clip for them haters bitch
