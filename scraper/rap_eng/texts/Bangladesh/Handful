Hey you ain't ready for me, ooh ooh no
Hey you ain't ready for me, ooh no ooh no

I'm known the block to keep my weight up like the big guys
Know how to throw my weight like the big guys
And I want to much I got big eyes
So I see how to get it wit these big eyes
Keep It Flashing with my worrking pumps on
Working dress with some lipstick on
This world ain't ready for this honey comb
If you a handfull sing along

Ba, ba, bah, bah, bah, bah, bah, bah, bahh, bah, bah, bahhh
I'm a handful
Ba, ba, bah, bah, bah, bah, bah, bah, bahh, bah, bah, bahhh

Hear me beating down the black with my grey porsch Cayene
Gotta be hot red like cayene
Some them dudes hittin switches in them low lows
I know how to hit them switches in the low lows
You might see me with a 3 peice on
Pin stripe holla fitted cap on
You ain't ready for this honeycomb
If you a handfull sing along

Na na nah boo boo Is it overwhelming
Can't stand the drama
If you having problems
This how you sole em'
Tell em' you a handful

Ba, ba, bah, bah, bah, bah, bah, bah, bahh, bah, bah, bahhh
Hey you ain't ready for me oh no, oh no (I'm a handful)
Hey You Ain't ready for me oh no, oh no (I'm a handful)

Na na nah boo boo is it overwhelming
Can't stand the drama
If you having problems
Just can't help it
Na na nah boo boo
If you having problems
This how you sole em'
Tell em'you a Hanful

Ba, ba, bah, bah, bah, bah, bah, bah, bahh, bah, bah, bahhh (I'm a handful)
Ba, ba, bah, bah, bah, bah, bah, bah, bahh, bah, bah, bahhh
Ba, ba, bah, bah, bah, bah, bah, bah, bahh, bah, bah, bahhh
Hey you ain't ain't ready for me oh no (I'm a handful)
Hey you ain't ain't ready for me oh no (I'm a handful)
