[Verse 1]
Watch me whip this cheese
I got special needs
I got special honey that mean I got special bees
I got so much money and so many properties
I'll show you my red mini if you say pretty please
I come from the city and I got so many E's (oh yeah)
So many G's, so many cups
Fill them up with ease, then I take a sup
Mm, tasty, put it in the basty
Everybody's looking at me cos I'm tasty
Cos I'm racey
That's first place
This song is crazy
Hey, whats up Stace?
