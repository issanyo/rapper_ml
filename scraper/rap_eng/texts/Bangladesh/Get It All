[Sean Garrett]
She said baby...
[Nicki Minaj]
I know you love her, but I love you

[VERSE 1: Sean Garrett]
She caught my face like a Kodak
I couldn't shake the weather
Storm had nothing on this chick named Heather
Damn everytime I seen her, it was just the thought of break up
You know niggas and girls how they quit then they make up
She told me she been in love with me every since we were in 6th grade
Ms. Hills class, I'm just thinking (ahh ohh)
Mighty funny didn't notice her back then
But now her body banging, got me thinkin (ahh ohh)
I'm just thinkin I'm to quick to fall
I wanna hit it but I'm still involved

[Bridge]
She told me that the girl I'm with don't get it
She wanna show me she can be better girlfriend

(Chorus)
Shawty said she had so many dreams of her and me, she couldn't sleep
She tellin me to come and get it all (get it all)
She so glad the girlfriend that I use to have didn't wanna treat me right
So she told me I can get it all (get it all)
Best believe me she gon get it all (get it all)
Best believe me she gon get it all (get it all)

[Bridge]
She told me that the girl I'm with don't get it She wanna show me she can be
Better girlfriend

[VERSE 2: Nicki Minaj]
Stop playin man I been hotter than summer school
Cuz even then I use yo make them mutha fuckas drool
I been bad since sticky hands
Now all these bitches is Nicki fans
I gotta chuckle, excuse the duffle
I mean my ring so big it just bruise my knuckles
And I just heard that you was back on the market
Let me stick shift, ride it, back it up, and then park it
You and me, we should be together
Cop da matchin Lamborghini Swahili leather
Now dat dat dat dats black on black
And if the bitch call ya phone that's a backhand smack
Nigga what

[Bridge]
She told me that the girl I'm with don't get it
She wanna show me she can be better girlfriend

(Chorus)
Shawty said she had so many dreams of her and me, she couldn't sleep

Best believe me she gon get it all (get it all)
Best believe me she gon get it all (get it all)

[SEan Garrett]
She freaky tangerine tone
Body belong on the cover of the 2010 swimsuit issue of SI
She told me to don't leave her until I know done got over the whole fever
And I can't stop

Best believe me she gone get it all

She said it's just like when you hit a ball
If you gone swing you better get it all
