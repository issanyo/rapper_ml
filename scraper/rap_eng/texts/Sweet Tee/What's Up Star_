[Verse 1]
Hit the carwash to get a fresh shine
I don't know how you buy yours but that's how I like mine
Think girls don't style, how ya figure
One arm's on my steering wheel, the other arm's around my nigga
This pocket's phat, don't get offended cause
Somebody makes it so somebody's gotta spend it
I take it from the boardroom to the boulevard
Troopin' all the players like I play cards
I pump up my Jeep and get hot
And once I put my tape in the slot my speakers hit the jackpot
Time time for some action, I got to be the main attraction
Blowin' up like Toni Braxton
Pick my girls up to check the party uptown
I leave my shorty home cause I'm tryina fuck around
At the sportsbar, honeys everywhere are lookin' mink
What's up star, let's get a drink

[Hook]
What's up star, I'd like to get to know who you are
Let's have drinks at the bar
What's up star, I'd like to get to know who you are
And if I like what I see then the drinks is on me

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Well is it you or is it me, uh, I saw you glancin'
I peeped you from the door and on the floor when you was dancin'
This is the pick up line, I got the big up mine
I'm steppin' to ya like a stick up
I don't have to drop on ya
So let's go get a drink on the low and kick in in the corner
To the bar start walkin' and I'mma hit you off
On some of that good shit I was talkin'
I hope to keep you interested, you should get with this kid
And if you lucky you could hit this
But don't get souped, it's just a conversation at the bar star
And if ya slip you get the scissor

[Hook]

[The Mad Rapper] x2
Sex on the beach and gin & juice
Long Island Ice Tea makes me get loose
A glass of Moet and Alize
Cause this type of shit happens every day

[Verse 3]
Cuties everywhere I turn, when am I gonna learn
I be outta control, I see what I want and I roll
I get the digits quick from the honeys, they be fly and all that
But right now that's not where my head is at
Over and over again I step off quickly with my friends
To put this little love shit to a dead end
I got to stay on point, checkin' the honey with a tag
I got to bag my next chick
And there he is lookin' kosher, posin' like a poster
I won't bite come a little closer
I wanna talk but it's loud shit
And it's gettin' kinda hot in this crowd shit
So step over to the bar, and let's kick that lingo
I like to mingle, honey are ya single
If I give you the OK that means I like what I see
What's up star drinks is on me

[Hook]
