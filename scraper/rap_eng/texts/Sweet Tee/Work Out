	Think it's a party, work out
	Everybody work out
	Think it's a party, work

	Work

Jump on this beat
Pump it up, rock with Sweet Tee
It's time to jam, so get out of your seat
Come on, get on up, get down to the sounds
Droppin pound by pound
Shakin and breakin and movin and groovin it all around
That's what it's all about, there's no doubt
Let's work it out, turn it out, burn it out
Now
Move it

	[female voice]
	Work out
	Everybody work out
	Think it's party work out

This is a jam man
Not a grandstand
I wanna see some butts shakin, backs breakin
Feet skippin and hips dippin
I demand you to dance
There's no wallflower-power
This hour, work out now, or

	W-w-work

	Work it out

	(Ooh, that's the move?
	That's the move
	A-ha
	You gotta ride it, baby
	It's gettin hotter
	It's gettin hotter
	It's gettin hotter
	It's gettin hot)

It's a party damn it (work)
Put your body in it (work)
Let the lyrics move you (work)
And our music groove you (work)
People come alive (work)
Shift into overdrive (work)
It's a dancin record (w-w-w)
Do what's expected (work)

	(See how you start gettin...
	Look at you, look at you)

Sweet Tee's in effect, what the heck
I want cash, not a check
If I'm correct you can bet
You ain't heard nothin yet
Work it out hard, cause it's hot, so just sweat it
Yo, I ain't takin no shorts, so forget it
Hear the music drop
Let your body rock non-stop
Pump it up, let's go if it feels good ya don't stop
Now that you know
Then let's party, let's go
And work it out, yeah
You gotta-gotta-gotta-gotta

	Work out
	Everybody work out
	Think it's a party, work out

Now I think you got it (work)
Jettin like a rocket (work)
Wasn't hard, now was it? (work)
Everybody does it (work)
]From New York with respect (work)
Work out's in full effect (work)
My mission is complete (work)
Gave you a dope beat (work)
