Nigga don't test me
Or You'll be feeling crunchy like some nestle, ha
I'll be poppin caps in demons asprin
I Know you're drooling off my beats here's a napkin
I got the drug for the east and the west coast
I got a new kind of blunt for the holy ghost
Shekinah Glory make your fuse is a nice choking
I hate to tell you that my ministry ain't no joke
Here's the chorus y'all

(Chorus)
My name is Tonéx and the demons i slay
Listen to what i say i will never lead you astray
(What's my name, What's my name y'all)
My name is Tonéx and the demons i slay
Listen to what i say i will never lead you astray
(My Name is Pronounced Toe-Nay, Uh Yeah, And if you don't know now you know hah)
