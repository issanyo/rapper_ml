[Intro]
"If you don't mind, (if you don't mind)
We'd like to play somethin' (play somethin')"

Gloria, pick up, I know you're there
Stop frontin', just pick up
Aight look, look, I know I messed up
But check it out, just listen

[Verse 1]
I'm leavin' you this message spotly cause I miss you
I didn't mean to diss you but sometimes I slip
You got me stumblin' over boulders, lookin' over my shoulders
Hopin' you're behind me but the sun blinds my vision
No competition cause I'm wishin' and hopin'
That we could go to Canada and elope-in', but nope-in'
I know you caught me playin' with your heart
Shoulda known that I was up to no good from the start
Little hoodrat, who's that guy I saw you walkin' with
Talkin' with, actin' like he's wit ya
Just like 2Pac you know I get around
But I didn't mean to get around with your little sister
Think I was lookin' for your friend, so let me try again
To prove myself cause I don't want nobody else
It's been 7 hours and 16 days since you took your love away
So I just want to say that you should

[Hook] x2
Come back to me
Come back to me
Baby, baby, please, come back to me

[Verse 2]
Oh stacker, cracker, I'm the one who's badder
1 step, 2 step, 3 step, 4
Oh are you sure that you really want to leave me?
I tell you that I love you but I don't think you believe me
I never meant you any wrong, my dear
Besides, yo, you can't believe everything you hear
So just like Stevie, I wonder, is there water all under the bridge
It's thrillin', but lately I've had the strangest feelin', like Jodeci
I'm goin' through the emotions, so baby won't you just stay, okay?
I'm tryin' to get you off of my mind but you just won't go away
In fact, just the other day, I was coolin' at a party on a Friday
Doin' things my way, chillin' with my cousin Shareef
A girl walks my way, couldn't say get away
Cause, then again, it goes against my Islamic beliefs
So I'ma kick game, get to know the honey's name
Cause you know that I was lookin' for a real good time
She was fine, so I kicked a few lines
But I couldn't get ya out my mind, get ya out of my mind, so

[Hook] x4

[Verse 3]
All the real good ships of lollypops
Stop for a second and listen to ya heart
And if ya still say no, then I'ma, have to let you go
And then wave goodbye, and give one last cry
Cause I'm not goin' to take it no more, so don't do that
Can't keep breakin' my heart, so don't pursue that
Time has been wasted, time has been spent
Pain is the essence, but not my intent
So gaze through the woods and stop through the meadows
Cause I love Lucy like Bill love Jello
And if you ever change your mind one day
Then you know where I stay, just a block away
And I wait for you to

[Hook] x4

[Outro]
"Do you like the music, do you, do you like the music"
"Hey, you ruined my record, man! I just bought it!"
