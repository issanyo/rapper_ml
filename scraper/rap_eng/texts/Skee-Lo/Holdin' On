(Skee-Lo)
Bonsai and oh my
Yippee ki-yi-yay
Hello, hello, hello
Hooray, hooray, hooray
I am here to interrupt your regular program
So hey, man, now don't you touch that dial
Unless we step in single file
Keep it pretty slowly
Cause you know I like to focus on the ease
And you can call me Skee if you please
So come on in, come on in
Come in and give a pound, mix and mingle with your friends
Or just have a drink or just sit down
Get up, stand up, come on throw your hands up
If ya girl is throwin' fronts then your brothers keep your chin up
Be cool with the flexin', she's in the mood for sexin'
You could pop the question, but that's just my suggestion
And when the mood is right, we can switch it off to candle light
But hold on to your girls, cause if you don't, well, then I might
I know that you just might be in the mood-a
To want to shoot a spark into the dark
But this is just a start

(Chorus)
I'll keep holdin' on
I'll keep holdin' on

(Skee-Lo)
Thinkin' back, black, yo, I could remember that high school flame
Now was it Nikki or Lorraine? Yo, what was her name?
Anyway, she was so cute that back at school I tried to rock it
But she often put her purse to any brothers tryin' to knock it
So stop it, to get with, I got with, but what's this?
Was honey just fakin' it that kept me from my ducats?
Now the rain has gone I can clearly see
What was we, enemies?
Not for long, alone is what she wants to be
But what am I to do, what am I do to?
What would you do if you were in the same shoes?
With a bunch of bad news from my hoodrat
Sorry, but I gotta scatter, I'm movin' from the east to the west
So please say God Bless, and oh yes, see I miss her very much
I wish that I could give her my number so that she could stay in touch
I wonder if she remembers me and what went on
And if she does not understand, word is bond, I'ma keep holdin' on

(Chorus)
I'll keep holdin' on
(I'ma keep holdin' on)
I'll keep holdin' on

(Skee-Lo)
Well hello my honey dips
See I'm back from my trip
All the letters you wrote I kept
Do you remember when I left?
I said, "I'm leavin' on the next plane
Don't know when I'll be back again"
Kiss me, smile for me, tell me that you'll wait for me
Hold me like you'll never let me go, my little trick-a-dee
Cause life is what you make as we take it as reality
Now we're reunited and it feels so good
You know were reunited and it feels so good
Through the centuries of time heal the rhymes and unwind
Melodies flowin' swift with the jazz fill
Kill the lights, move in closer to your loved ones
Baby, hold 'em tight like tomorrow never comes
Gaze into the eyes, sympathize not the sympathy
Me and Mrs. Jones got a marriage going on, understand me
Everything is dandy, so what can be wrong?
And if you now know the song, then sing along

(Chorus)
I'll keep holdin' on
I'll keep holdin' on
(My word is true)
I'll keep holdin' on
I'll keep holdin' on
(I'ma keep holdin' on)
I'll keep holdin' on
I'll keep holdin' on
