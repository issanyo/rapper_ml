[Verse 1]
Growin' up as a kid, tough skins and Afros
Wasn't South Central, but still it came natural
It wasn't nobody to watch my back
Didn't wanna be strapped or get jacked
Mama taught me not to trust no man
Brother, what's your plan?
If you ever lose a fight, then you go back again and win
And I don't care if he was one of your friends
You better bury your feelings within, and understand
'Cause on top of the stairs
They got keys to Cadillacs, BMWs, Mercedes Benzes and all of that
And on top of the stairs, yeah
They got color TVs and even girls come in two pairs
And on the bottom you've got nothin' but guilt
Bad feelings being felt, dead homies being killed
When I die, always know that I never wanna see my little brother drop
So you better stay on top

[Chorus 2X]
'Cause no one really cares about the guy on the bottom
No one really cares about the guy beneath
And everybody wants to be down with the dude
On top of the stairs, top of the stairs

[Verse 2]
Little brother, look around you, can't you see
All the possibilities and we, you and me
To the bang boogie, up jump the boogie
To the boogie to the boogedy beat, I'm an emcee
I spent three years in Mickey D's cleanin' dishes
Half of that time was makin' wishes
Wanted to hit switches in a brand new 6-4
But all I could afford was a number nine at Roscoe's for chicken and waffles
How about that Honda Accord?
Used to watch 'em drive by at night 'til I got bored
But not no more, really, that's for sure
'Cause I gotta million honeys knockin' on my door
And I'm not tryin' to score with one
'Cause diseases kill and that's ill
To make a mill and then you gettin' done
When you on top of the world girls may come
But when you fall down you won't find one

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Little brother, this is all we got
Me and you, we be crew
Even though it doesn't seem like a lot, it is
So don't be thinkin' negative
I know just how you feel when you got time to kill I'll tell you how it is
I know you might be unsure
'Cause it gets rough out there and when it rains and pours
I stole shoes from stores, hung out with cool cats
Put cars on flats, broke windows with bats
And that's not all, even made crank phone calls
I was flossin' on Slauson and Fox Hills Mall (So whattup y'all?)
After all, please check my credentials
I once got busy in the Winchell's, yeah
So throw your hands in the air
Wave 'em around if you've been treated unfair, yeah
'Cause no one cares (about me)
No one cares (about you)
Top of the stairs, top of the stairs (yeah)

[Chorus 4X]

[Outro]
Yeah
To all my little brothers out there
It's cool to be on top, but don't ever forget where you came from
Most importantly you better remember
The little guy you step on to get on top
Is the same guy you gonna run into going back down
Yeah
Top of the stairs
