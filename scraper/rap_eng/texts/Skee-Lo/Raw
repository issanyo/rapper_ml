[Hook]
My name is Skee and I’m raw
Niggas can’t believe that I’m raw
This little nigga go Mighty Mouse when I Hercules your jaw
When I take a leak in your spa
When I take the keys to your car
I’m central, South Central, F-U side of the law
Nigga this raw

[Verse 1]
I told you before that I really ain't nothing to fool with
You niggas that come in the game and mention my name I want nothing to do with
You’re useless, like monkey wrenches from one of my tool kits
A nigga that’s not a solution is part of the problem if he really don’t do shit
This is the new shit, out of the blue shit, we calling it hip hop
Serving you niggas like IHOP, hurting you bitches and why not (2Pac!)
Black guy with a black eye, fat lip want to set trip
My nine-millimeter bust sixteen rounds in the air motherfucker on exit

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Anybody that’ll open his mouth and fuck around with a veteran
I done told you, illiterate son of a bitch
I’m in a room full of medicine (Excedrin)
Exhilarate nothing but hate and give a motherfucker Ativan
Excuse me, but I go to pray east so nigga don’t go H.A.M
A nigga got bars, a nigga got cars, a nigga got flow, a nigga got style
You niggas got ours, niggas from Mars
Black guy with a black eye fat lip want to set trip
My nine-millimeter bust sixteen rounds in the air motherfucker on exit

[Hook]

[Instrumental Outro]
