For one price, for one price, for one price
In the whole history of man, in the whole history of man
In the whole history of man
All the people on this earth are joined by

(Skee-Lo)
I don't need your sympathy your misery is drivin me insane
You got your hands out but I refrain
From givin you a pound you bloody hound
You better take heed to cause I don't need you to hang around
Now you wasn't cool ever since back when I got jumped
You played the punk and ran a sprint
See one of us is trippin but I was just concerned
At the time I lost my wallet
And you found it stole my money then returned it
You used to claim in front of people we were next of kin
I never knew that you were sleepin with my girlfriend
And if I did I would've bashed you maybe thrashed you
I never asked you homie tell me is it true
Because I knew you were up to no good
Spreadin rumours on me in the neighbourhood
Yeah, so let me bring this to my point
We ain't friends, we ain't homies and we never shared a joint
So you ain't down

(Chorus)
(Skee-Lo)
(You ain't down)
I don't need your sympathy
Your simple case of misery has caused me pain
(You ain't down with me no more)
Yeah, you ain't down
(You ain't down)
I don't need your misery
Cause mamma said what goes around comes back again
(You ain't down with me no more)
(You ain't down)

(Skee-Lo)
I remember girls in college who was never ever
Among these beautiful women was my favourite name Venetta
Pain, love and agony she's all of the above
I keep thinkin to myself "Oh I don't wanna fall in love"
But oh Venetta I read your letter
And it gets better as I read on down the lines but in my mind
I cannot find out why you wanna diss me
Getting me to fall in love with you and just to say you can't be with me
(You ain't down)
You're messin with my head and although it seems
Your heart is darker than the night so I'm prepared to use my high beams
You had me doin things silly things
Sharin with you my feelings and in the meantime you was killin
Me softly hey women get off me you know you lost me
Hey that's what you get for actin flossy
You caused me to open up my eyes and look around
I see that we ain't friends, we ain't lovers we ain't homies baby
You ain't down

(Chorus)
(Skee-Lo)
(You ain't down)
I don't need your sympathy
Your simple case of misery has caused me pain
(You ain't down with me no more)
Yeah, you ain't down
(You ain't down)
I don't need your misery
Cause mamma said what goes around comes back again
(You ain't down with me no more)
(You ain't down)
(You ain't down)
I don't need your sympathy
Your simple case of misery has caused me pain
(You ain't down with me no more)
Yeah, you ain't down
(You ain't down)
I don't need your misery
Cause mamma said what goes around comes back again
(You ain't down with me no more)

(Skee-Lo)
This is dedicated to the kids who ain't crew
You ain't never been down so homie ain't no pounds for you
You'll never know me so don't you try to show me
We can be friends you can now but somehow you did back then
Just to be down with me you don't need a change of heart
Just change your life and your identity
Cause everybody's on my jock tryin to flag me down
When I come around the block
It's all the same the only thing that's changed is
You used to call me puff but now you call me by name
You and your friends get no love, sympathy or pain
If I gave you the chance then you would diss me again
Is it fortune and fame that you persist to be around?
I don't wanna see a smile I don't wanna see a frown
So now you know that's how it was and that's how it is
By the way stay out of my biz
Cause homie you ain't down

(Chorus)
(Skee-Lo)
(You ain't down)
I don't need your sympathy
Your simple case of misery has caused me pain
(You ain't down with me no more)
Yeah, you ain't down
(You ain't down)
I don't need your misery
Cause mamma said what goes around comes back again
(You ain't down with me no more)
(You ain't down)
(You ain't down)
I don't need your sympathy
Your simple case of misery has caused me pain
(You ain't down with me no more)
Yeah, you ain't down
(You ain't down)
I don't need your misery
Cause mamma said what goes around comes back again
(You ain't down with me no more)
(You ain't down with me)
(You ain't down with me)
(You ain't down with me)
