Mister Morton is the subject my sentence
And what the predicate says, he does
Mister Morton is the subject my sentence
And what the predicate says, he does
Mister Morton is the subject my sentence
And what the predicate says, he does

The subject is a noun
That's a person, place or thing
It's who or what the sentence is about
And the predicate is the verb
That's the action word
That gets the subject up and out

Mister Morton wrote Pearl a poem
(Say what?)
Mister Morton wrote
Pearl replied in the afternoon
(How she replied?)
She replied by note
Mister Morton was very nervous
Mister Morton was

The cat stretched
The sun beat down
A neighbor had chased his kid
And each sentence is completed but only when
You know exactly what the subject did

And what the predicate says, he does

And what the predicate says, he does

[Verse 5]
Mister Morton knocked on her door
Mister Morton knocked
And Mister Morton sat on her porch
Yeah, see he sat and rocked
Mister Morton was a nervous man
When she opened the door he ran

Mister Morton climbed up the stairs
Mister Morton climbed
Mister Morton was lonely man
Mister Morton was
Until Pearl showed up with a single rose
Who says women can't propose?
