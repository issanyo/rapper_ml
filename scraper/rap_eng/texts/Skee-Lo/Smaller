[Intro]
Hello?

[Hook]
I wish I was a little bit smaller, I wish I was a baller
I wish I had a girl who looked good, I would call her
I wish I had a rabbit in a hat with a bat
And a six four Impala

[Verse 1]
I wish I was like five-foot-nine on the three-point line
It's a scandal, but really it was the good kind
When it comes to playing basketball
I'm always last to be picked and in some cases, never picked at all

[Hook]
I wish I was a little bit smaller, I wish I was a baller
I wish I had a girl who looked good, I would call her
I wish I had a rabbit in a hat with a bat
And a six four Impala

[Verse 2]
I wish I had a brand new car
So far, I got this Hasback and everywhere I go, yo, I get laughed at
You wanna know what's really whack?
Getting your ankles tapped and your ego smacked (ughh)
They give him love for a layup or lob
They have the people like "Oh my gosh!"
If anybody wanna play, small ballers hit the lottery today
If I step inside the paint, I'm gon' fall
If I step outside of the paint, I'm gon' fall
It don't care how quick, how fast or how tall
They gon' work every inch of the court against y'all

[Hook]
I wish I was a little bit smaller, I wish I was a baller
I wish I had a girl who looked good, I would call her
Wish I had a rabbit in a hat with a bat
And a six four Impala

[Hook]
I wish I was a little bit smaller, I wish I was a baller
I wish I had a girl who looked good, I would call her
Wish I had a rabbit in a hat with a bat
And a six four Impala

[Bridge]
Hey, you, don't look down
All the shook guys is winning right now
All the shook guys is winning right now
All the shook guys is winning right now
I wish I was a little bit smaller, y'all
I wish I was a baller
Said I wish I was a little bit smaller, y'all
I wish I was a baller

[Outro]
Said I wish I was a little bit smaller, y'all
I wish I was a baller
Said I wish I was a little bit smaller, y'all
I wish I was a baller, yeah
