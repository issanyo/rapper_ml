(*"Come on" scratched several times*)

(Skee-Lo)
Jump, jump Geronimo, buckle up and here we go
I'm here to entertain and introduce my name
I'm Skee to the Lo and I'm here to do a show
And if you forgot or do not, then act like you know
If you could see this wannabe, I'm makin' sure you're readin' me
Know of me, knew of me, let me hear your demo
I rushed it, rushed it to the toilet and I flushed it
Cause cuss words are hush words, so shh, I'm disgusted
Just sit back, baby listen to your radio
Baffled as a bat, sayin', "Who is that?"
It's the mad, mad ones from Mad Tracks
Makin' mad beats for you punks to get mad at
So, if you really want to know to who's beat am I rhymin'
Really doesn't matter, cause I'ma make ya scatter
I might get through but if you wanna start
3 'o' clock, we can take it to the park
I'll be waitin' for ya

(Chorus)
(*"Come on" scratched several times*)
Not unless I say I'll be waitin
Not unless I say I'll be waitin

(Skee-Lo)
Snap, crackle, pop, oh wow, look at me now
Holy cow, watch me, blow up, blow up, make ya throw up
I got mad fills to make mad bills
If I want a buffalo ruffa-so big
About my chis-nip skills I get ill to make a mill
From the basement of my cris-nip
Wreck shop and get biz with ruff kids
Like Jodeci, makin' sure you notice me
Or was we emcees but wanted all our enemies to stop
And just run, run from-a, cause I'm the Don Dadda
Of rap, and you don't want to hear that, so
The number 1, I'm 2, I'm 3, yo follow me
Yo 'nuff respect due to the one who calls me
Not Jamaican, a Rastafarian
I play Atari and sometimes Nintendo
Relieves me from the Indo leaf
You got beef and loose teeth
But you really wanna start, we can take it to the park
I'll be waitin' for ya

(Chorus)
(*"Come on" scratched several times*)
Wait, waitin' in the park
Waitin' for ya
Waitin' in the park
Waitin' for ya
Waitin' in the park
Waitin' for ya
Waitin' in the park
Waitin' for
Not unless I say I'll be waitin'
Not unless I say I'll be waitin'

(Skee-Lo)
Red Rover, Red Rover, now watch me come on over
You know I'll cross the sea as if my name was Noah
Watch out cause I'll blow ya clear across the continent
Cause you know Apollo like the Lincoln monument
(So hey!) I'm famous, but never call me nameless
I don't like cookies, never been a rookie
Played hooky, so whoopee
Arrest me, protest me, do with me what you wanna
But you know you're gonna have to give me props, give me props
I zip like lock, grab my microphone and rock, bad news on the block
Did you forget, forgot, sweat me, not
Well listen to the sounds of a rapper go pop
The weasel, like diesel I fills up your truck
I got the talent so I make the bucks
I wreck shops for hip-hop and even recruits
Give me a beat so I can flow and I'ma wreck that too
Cause I'll be waitin' for ya

(Chorus)
(*"Come on" scratched several times*)
Wait, waitin' in the park
Waitin' for ya
Waitin' in the park
Waitin' for ya (not unless I say)
Waitin' in the park
Waitin' for ya (not unless I say)
Waitin' in the park
Waitin' for
Ya, in the park
Waitin' for ya
In the park
Waitin' for ya
In the park
Waitin' for ya
In the park
Waitin' for ya
In the park
Waitin' for ya
