(Skee-Lo)
Yeah, this is not the diddy cause the diddy's dum, dum
Now I'm checkin' out the sounds of the phat jazz drum
The horns and the samples with the bass and the boom
When added all together, it's a phat jazz tune
Listen, examine this carefully, you can even dance to the beat
Or chill and have a seat, or choke of the smoke of a cactus tree
As I'm steady pumpin' sounds out my NBC
With the natural ability to make you wanna get down
And maybe slap five to everyone around
So pass me a drink, stop and let me think
About the sounds of the street - The Funkadella Beat
So go and get your friends and strap yourselves in
For the journey's of your life, the saga now begins
3, 2, 1, contact, we have lift off, right?
So I'm about to take flight, and this is how it sounds

(Skee-Lo)
I freak the funk on the microphone, check it, baby, 1, 2
Cause I got the skills and I thought that maybe you knew
That I can be chilled and have a good time
So when you see me, make sure you throw up your peace signs
Recline, let your mind be free
Till the break of dawn, at a club I'll be
So you know to put your dirty hands up in the air
And wave 'em side to side like you just don't care, yeah
Sister's in the back with the afros
And the brothers in the corner with the jerboas
And if you haters start trouble, you know where to go
And now you're tuned in to the sounds of the Skee-Lo
I take the stage and your aid to another fella emcee
Produce tracks is not wack, with sounds from my MP
3, 2, 1, contact, we have lift off, right?
And so I'm about to take flight, and this is how it sounds

(Skee-Lo)
Beats they be infinite and phatter than the pork
The sounds can be heard from Cali to New York
Forget about your troubles, forget about your blues
Cause jazz is alive, so go and spread the news
And once the news is heard, then others can relate
Maybe find the phattest samples from the back of the crates
So chill, cool with the breeze, microphone check, one, two, to the three
Break down doors, dance on floors, and have your fun
Cause the party doesn't stop till the morning comes
Yeah, now I can feel the beats, so I'ma kick back for a second
Have a seat, yo, and this is how it sounds

(Skee-Lo)
This is how it sounds
Yeah, this is how it sounds
