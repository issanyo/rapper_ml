[Chorus]
You can call me when you want me, if you need a friend you got me
I'll be your everything, fulfill your every dream
We can do it automatic, I can freak you with my gadget
I'll be your everything
You'll see I'm everything you want and more

[verse 1]
I knew the moment that we met
I had to be inside of you, someone you won't forget
So don't say I'm like the other few
No matter what is going down, you'll find me next to you

Girl, I'll be your superman, I'll do what no one can
You'll find that I'm the everything that you need
Deep down inside of you
No matter what you do
You'll see I'm everything you want and more

[Chorus]
You can call me when you want me, if you need a friend you got me
I'll be your everything, fulfill your every dream
We can do it automatic, I can freak you with my gadget
I'll be your everything
You'll see I'm everything you want and more

[verse 2]
No sweat, when the claw is on his way
Don't worry 'bout him catching you, don't even be afraid
Some how some way, I'll find out what's the deal
And I'll be there to rescue you, you'll see that I'm for real

Girl, I'll be your superman, I'll do what no one can
You'll find that I'm the everything that you need
Deep down inside of you
No matter what you do
You'll see I'm everything you want and more

You can call me when you want me, if you need a friend you got me
I'll be your everything, fulfill your every dream
We can do it automatic, I can freak you with my gadget
I'll be your everything
You'll see I'm everything you want and more

[Verse 3: Skee Lo]
I'll be your gadget, the one you call to make magic, most rap stars live lavish
Got you a benz for a carriage and even a rock, about 8 to 10 carats but you almost forgot
When we both went to Paris, and you took shots, cause of you, look at all the drinks I got think
Back and look at all the minks you rocked and I know you'll be impressed from the things
I got cause I'm Mr. Gadget

[Chorus]
You can call me when you want me, if you need a friend you got me
I'll be your everything, fulfill your every dream
We can do it automatic, I can freak you with my gadget
I'll be your everything
You'll see I'm everything you want and more

You can call me when you want me, if you need a friend you got me
I'll be your everything, fulfill your every dream
We can do it automatic, I can freak you with my gadget
I'll be your everything, You'll see I'm everything you want and more
