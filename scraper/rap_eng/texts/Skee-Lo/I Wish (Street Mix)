Yeah!

[Intro/Chorus: Skee-Lo]
I wish I was little bit taller, I wish I was a baller
I wish I had a girl who looked good, I would call her
Wish I had a rabbit in a hat
With a bat and a six-four Impala

[Verse One: Skee-Lo]
I wish I was like 6'9, so I can get with Leoshi
Cause she don't know me but yo she's really fine
You know I see her all the time, everywhere I go
Even in my dreams I can scheme of ways to make her mine
Cause I know she's livin fat
Her boyfriend's tall and he plays ball
So how am I gonna compete with that?
Cause when it comes to playing basketball
I'm always last to be picked and in some cases never picked at all
So I just lean up on the wall
Or sit up in the bleachers with the rest of the girls
Who came to watch they men ball
Dag y'all! I never understood black
Why the jocks get the fly girls and me I get the hood rats
I tell 'em scat, skittle, scabobble
Got hit with a bottle, been in the hospital for talkin that mess
I confess it's a shame when you livin in a city
That's the size of a box and nobody knows yo' name
Glad I came to my senses
Like quick-quick got sick-sick to my stomach
Overcometh by the thoughts of me and her together, right?
So when I asked her out she said I wasn't her type

[Chorus] - repeat 2X

[Verse Two: Skee-Lo]
I wish I had a brand new car, so far, I got this hatchback
And everywhere I go yo I gets laughed at
And when I'm in my car I'm laid back
I got an 8-track and a spare tire in the backseat but that's flat
And do you really wanna know what's really whack?
See I can't even get a date so what'chu think of that?
I heard that prom night is the bomb night
With the hood rats you can hold tight
But really though, I'm a figaro
When I'm in my car I can't even get a hello
Well so many people wanna cruise Crenshaw on Sunday
Well then I'ma have to get in my car and go
You know I take the 110 until the 105
Get off at Crenshaw tell my homies look alive
Cause it's hard to survive when you're livin
In the concrete jungle and these girls keep passin' me by
She looks fly, she looks fly
Make me say my, my, my

[Chorus] - repeat 2X

[Verse Three: Skee-Lo!]
Heyyyy! I wish I had my way, cause every day would be a Friday
You could even speed on the highway
I would play ghetto games, name my kids ghetto names
Little Mookie, Big Al, Lorraine
Yo you know that's on the real
So if you're down on your luck yhen you should know just how I feel
Cause if you don't want me around
See I go simple, I go easy, I go Greyhound
Hey, you, what's that sound?
Everybody look what's goin down
Ahhhh, yes, ain't that fresh?
Now everybody wants to get down like that

[Chorus] - repeat 2X

[Skee-Lo]
Yeah!

Wish you were taller, wish you were a baller
