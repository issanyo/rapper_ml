[Intro: Deuce]
There once was a kid named Deuce
Who got sick and tired of being picked on
So he got himself a nice twenty-two
Click-boom, now he's on the fucking news

[Verse 1: Deuce]
Now, who's the king of these rap acts, American badass?
They say he's a class act, no wonder he's jabbed at
That's why they put me up in lights, and I rap back
And half these critics wanna mimic my crack ass
He ain't no cynic, but he knows where your dad's at
They ain't gon' finish till they send you to Baghdad
And minute by minute, they gon' pull you right in it
You gon' end up at clinics because they put you on Xanax
But don't you worry, I'm back, yeah, Deuce is back with a black hat
Cape and a black cat, baby, I'm the new Batman
You know only Angie can grab that
I don't need no groupies trying to grab at
My pants, hoping I'mma go back and tax that
I ain't ending up in no place with no bad rash
How come I get laughed at by media trash bags?
Just because I'm white and I sing like I'm half-black?

[Chorus: Deuce]
Now you see my life, and it looks so pretty, looks so pretty
You want what you can't have, and you know that's too damn bad
Try and take my pride? We both know that's silly, know that's silly
But you want what you can't have, and you know that's too damn bad

[Verse 2: Skee-Lo].
I'm gonna make it, no matter how long it takes me
I'm sick of lower living, I can't allow it to break me
My neighbors hate me, all they do is just make me
Bounce back, get on my hustle, achieving great things
An architect, building my future, watching it grow
Reaching out to the youth and I'm teaching 'em what I know
I done seen a lot of people do anything for the dough
Even rob, steal, kill, good girls that turned pro
Good fellas turned stick-up kids I used to know
Little Bobby graduated and college he couldn't go
The Earth rotates, a thousand thirty-seven and a third
Cops pull us over, tonight I'm on the curb
Getting handcuffed, deputies searching for contraband
I'm face-down, talking to God, he understands
Tomorrow I'mma start a new life, a changed man
But tonight I might be going to jail for eight grams, and

[Chorus: Deuce]
Now you see my life, and it looks so pretty, looks so pretty
You want what you can't have, and you know that's too damn bad
Try and take my pride? We both know that's silly, know that's silly
But you want what you can't have, and you know that's too damn bad

[Verse 3: Deuce]
I was born to rip shit, born with too much wit
That's why they call me the Wiz Kid 'cause I drop hits
Mimic me? I'm too sick; you can't hang, I'm too quick
What's my name? Deuce, bitch, it's the new shit
Leaving egos bruised and, yeah, you're trapped, you're stupid
Trying to step in my shoes, but it's foolish
I'm cuckoo, homie, I got screws loose
Fuck Tool, you can kiss my ass too, bitch
You and your Doctor Phil affiliates
You're worth two cents of my time and a few bars, so move bitch
As long as I'm doing music
I'mma be a nuisance, it's a new movement

[Chorus: Deuce]
Now you see my life, and it looks so pretty, looks so pretty
You want what you can't have, and you know that's too damn bad
Try and take my pride? We both know that's silly, know that's silly
But you want what you can't have, and you know that's too damn bad
Now you see my life, and it looks so pretty, looks so pretty
You want what you can't have, and you know that's too damn bad
Try and take my pride? We both know that's silly, know that's silly
But you want what you can't have and you know that's too damn bad

[Outro: Skee-Lo]
Deuces, Deuces, Deuces, Deuces
Skee-Lo, Skee-Lo, Skee-Lo, Deuces
