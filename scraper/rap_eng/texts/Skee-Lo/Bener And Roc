Yo, puttin' down, definition
Breakin' motherfuckers off proper like
And all y'all motherfuckers know what I mean

[Dizzy]
(Ain't no thang, ain't no thang)
Puttin' it down puttin' it down ain't no thang to me
(Ain't no thang, ain't no thang)
For me to knock niggas out the box daily

[Young Money]
Get out, watch ya steps and the ol' bucksway
Fire sixteen and we bust an oozy
What side can we ride on, take off your sign or
Fire tech-9 and we bust your car right
Here's one, it bust louder than a normal gun
Here's one, fire one and fire on and on
Ambush, we have bush and we have tech psycho
Run by and rat tat tat at cha' and ya trucko

[Skee-lo]
Bumptity bump is that shit that cha' get
When ya listenin' to the sounds of Da Brat (BABY!)
It's like that it's like that ain't no future in frontin'
So to avoid all that I keep bumpin' (AH NIGGA!)
I ain't no motherfucking joke (NIGGA!)
Step and get broke up loc
How I came in is how I'm goin' out (With a bang)
Puttin' it down, puttin' it down ain't no thang

[Dizzy]
(Ain't no thang, ain't no thang)
Puttin' it down puttin' it down ain't no thang to me
(Ain't no thang, ain't no thang)
It's the ZZ, it's one to the two to the motherfucking three
(Ain't no thang, ain't no thang)
Puttin' it down puttin' it down ain't no thang to me
(Ain't no thang, ain't no thang)
For me to knock niggas out the box daily
