[Intro]
Yeah, Skee-Lo, tights
When the vibe is right

[Hook]
You see, I found a love and it feels strange
And I don’t know your name and all I wanna know is
Can you be my love?
And I know you feel the way and trust me, I feel the same
That's when the vibe is right (Yeah, yeah, that's when the vibe is right)
Vibe is right

[Verse 1]
Yeah, yeah, I can feel your vibe
Makes me want to thrive
So amazing how you make a brother feel alive
I don’t really have a girl, I was telling lies
Hanging with the guys, I was only talking jive
I apologize, you the only one I need
I just want to make you happy but I can’t cope
Kind of difficult to be, kind of difficult to see who we are
So I hope to start a conversation, she’s Haitian
I’m from the nation, we can take a vacation, in fact
Meet up at the local train station, in fact
Wait here 'till a brother get back
Or you can call me, baby, this is all me, you can even stall me if you got to
Sleeping with a bunch of niggas if you want to
But don’t you, cause you’re much too smart for that
I can feel your vibe

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Yeah, yeah, when the vibe is right
I’m the liveliest, right?
Hit the boulevard and we can go dancing
Come here, baby, let me show you what I’m feeling
You the only woman that I see in the building
You know you make a brother want to hit the ceiling
You want to have children? I’m willing to get married
Go to Can Cujn, picture you and me, we at our honeymoon, Bell-Cap
Room service, she’s nervous
Come here, baby, let me show you what a birth is
I know I’m moving at a thousand thirty-seven and a third like the earth is
You can just call me, baby this is all me, you can even stall me if you got to
Mess around and stay single if you want to
But don’t you, cause you’re much too smart for that
I can feel your vibe

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Yeah, yeah, even through the hard times
If I’m doing hard time or I’m working part time for a year or so
I get back on the grind, cause you stay on my mind
Even through the hard times I ain’t hearing no rumors
You and him, me and her, never did occur, I just want to be with you
Never really felt something as real as this
I just really want to see it through
I’m at 4522 Colfax, block from the Wal-Mart by the train tracks
Right where the hoods and the thugs hang at
But you can come through and relax
Baby, jump to it, I’m going to do it
Find me a hell of a woman, that’s what you is
Never met a woman strong as you, I’m gone with you
I can get along with you, I’m feeling your vibe

[Hook]
