[Verse 1]
Ah, how many brothers been charged?
Go through wires and set fires in my garage
Sabotage, I'm coming to you fools in camouflage
Gods must be crazy, stole your style from the '80s
Lookin' at that, that's yo lady. Why she look like Grady?
Shady business, wanna stop and look at my profile
People like me be catching girls with Kangol hats and argyle
Styles, skills, I get ill every time I rhyme
Quantum's leap stole my jeep, gonna catch that fool in time
'Cause I'm Da Skeeter, Mr. Nine Millimeter, with bad aim
Fame, now I'm gonna live forever, never say die
Bronze eyed and black guy with a black eye, fat lip, wanna set trip
Dag y'all, look at my watch, I gotta shake this spot
So pow, look at this brother with styles
Think his name was Da Skeeter, Mr. Nine Millimeter
Watch out, holy cow-abunga
Hung a couple of signs from these trees
The day that I became an MC

[Chorus 2X]
It was the day that I became the Super
Was the day that I became the Superman
What? The Superman
The day that I became the Super
Was the day that I became the Superman
Superman
The day that I became the Super
Was the day that I became the Superman
What? The Superman
The day that I became the Super
Was the day that I became the Superman

[Verse 2]
I'm your idol like Michael, so won't you beat it
I'm deader like Shredder, I joined the Foot now I can't be defeated
Mistreated MCs like it was the '80s
My styles tighter than a wet Lycra on a 255-pound lady
Maybe, maybe not
Maybe you should check that
Pop this in yo' tape deck, play me in yo' cassette
On Channel 7 News at 11, watch these fools get hurt
Have you more confused than a Christian reading a Bible in a Muslim church
Come down to earth, now ask yourself is it worth
Losing your title in a rap recital?
I've been vital since my birth
MCs get faded 'cause I'm overrated
And if you lasted two rounds without getting blasted
Well, you lucky you made it
I'm the most hated MC, just like the homie
You'll be outie like last year, cookin' like Gary Coleman
'Cause no man, no children or woman can get with the Super
I got the West Coast sewn up and I load up your spot, trooper
And ain't no to be continued
When I get in you, you get looser
Hope that you get used to losing
So shut up and start thinking
Before I leave you danglin' from my mic cords
And you hear me swingin'

[Chorus]

Put your gun away, Superman don't run away
See I got x-ray, I can spot you like OJ on the freeway
But anyway, we can do this all today
'Cause I embarrass more people on national television than Richard Bey
Today's topic: "MCs who set-up for beat downs"
Sit down and tell me about your last lyrical meltdown
You come to battle you get beat like drums
And I'mma put you on a bus and send you back to where you came from
And I don't care if you don't like me now
You go home and tell your friends I'm the mighty one
AKA Skeeter, Mr. Nine Millimeter, with bad aim
Also known as Skee-Lo, but you can call me Superman

Super, Super, Superman
You know they call me Superman

Superman, Superman
