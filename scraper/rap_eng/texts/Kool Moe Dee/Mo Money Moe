Mo Money Moe

[Hook x4]
Mo' money Moe, mo' money

Im giving you revenue
Haven't you ever heard of new funk
Style, compile, me wild
Styles come pile the loot
Fattening pockets, I drop it
Rock it, I got it so hot
It's heating and beating
And eating up the comp even the hottest
Rhymes design combined
Don't even equal mine
They can't touch or cluth
Rhymes too rough to find
They can't see me, believe me
Even if money could be me
He comes on shorter than boxers, briefs
Or even bikinis
Dope variation or imitations
Couldn't make it cause
With a slight variation
I take'em, make'em and break'em
Kick'em, stick'em and vic'em
I chew'em, do'em and screw'em
Rhymes are like money mo' money
Because I know what Im doin'
So check it
Here comes the vet so step
Lightly and check the rep
Steppin' to me for rep
That ain't the rep to get
I dont just wreck cassettes
You better check the flow
Rhymes are like money mo' money
Here's some mo' money from Moe

[Hook x8]

[Verse 2]
Ch-Ch-Ching Ch-Ching
My rhymes are changing things
Ain't no small change I bring
Diamonds and jewels like kings
I drop jewels with tools
Not like these other fools
Microphone master rules
I'll never have to use
Uzis or Techs to wreck
Just gimme a mic and step
You buck shots and yet
I buck rhymes and get
Buck buck-wild and wet
Buck buck stages with sweat
My buck buck are just
Buck buck dollars and yes
Just like the 100 pennies
My rhymes are plenty so many
Nickel and dimes like rhymes
Style can combinate any
Lyrical flow with mo money from Moe
But the phatter the flow, the fatter the dough
The dough is a much better metaphor
Better for you to realize
The rhyme that you are juging and lovin'
Likin and nothing they rise
Once I eat'em and beat'em
You want to eat it I know
Some call it bread, some dough
I call it money from Moe

[Hook x8]

Ch-Ch-Ching Ch-Ching
Ch-Ch-Ching Ch-Ching
Yeah

[Verse 3]
My rhymes are like money, cold cash
No rational reason, Im cashing
Nothing but mics checks
Cash it, convert it into a smash hit
Hit after hits
Im totally lyrically fit, legit
Rhymes are real money
And not a big counterfeit
I with, slammin' and jammin'
And crammin' for rhyme exams
I am in shape to be tested
But don't you test me hot dammit
Rhyme bandit
Steal over yanders
And try to test me by cheating
I lead'em straight to the street
I speak some pussy and beat it
I make'em put up their money
So that they their loses are counted
How about it?
When I take all or nothing
Thats a test Im with, I doubt it
If I raise the stakes
You take a chance and its fight to the death
Put up or shut up, what up?
Lets get to the right and the left
Throwing the lyrical blow, flowing the lyrical flow
Flowing the lyrical dough
Often stay off of some Moe
Rhymin' for dollars
And Ill allow you to mic check it yo
After the mic check
Cash it and give it to Moe
