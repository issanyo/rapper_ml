I'm The Don
Armed and dangerous
With a mic I like
Ordain I just
Make a wish
It becomes a command
The rhyme family
Is my fans
My territory spans
From New York to Hollywood the whole country's
My neighborhood
I extort fans support
With rhymes that taught
Lessons and caught
The ears of listners
They enlist in the
Hip hop mob on the job
Stop dissin' us
No drugs at all
We don't steal or rob
We just get paid
In the Moe Dee mob
I demand fans family loyalty
Tour support and record royalties
Whenever a band tries to take my fans
I put out a hit understand

I'm The Don
Started out in parks
As a hit man killin'
With the rhymes that sparks a mic
Sparks of light
Turns dark to light
Freeze emcees
And they drop the mic
Hit the deck
You know what this is
Don't nobody move
And I mean biz
One dumb hero
Tried to step
I pulled out my mic
And rhymed him to death
Other emcees wouldn't
Put me on
So I took over
Now they're gone
I made the connections
Got paid protection
Fees from emcees
And no late collections
I take no shorts
Up front on the double
You ain't got it
You got trouble
I'll put out my mic
And a rhyme to bust
Huh
Another one bites the dust

With the ladies
I ain't just a Don
In fact I'm more
Like a Don Juan
Pull ladies
In bunches
Break my heart
I roll with the punches
Write 'em off like a tax
No respect
You ain't down
Next
Cause I'm like
A hard-core Casanova
Cross me once
Girlfriend you're over
Outta here quick as
A jet no sweat
There's no limit
To the girls I get
No time for games
Make no mistakes
Dis me you're done
That's the brakes
One conversation
Gets my point across
You don't like me
It's your loss
Spread the news
I get rave reviews
I'll make you
An offer you can't refuse

The Don
Takes control of the action
Without question
And who's askin'
A takeover
Now in effect
A world tour
To make my connect
The R&B radio
Family supports me
Put a hit on
On Top 40
The video familie's
B.E.T
Put a hit on
MTV
Store reports
And the Billboard charts
Work hand in hand
With the local jocks
As hit men for hire
Personal hit men
Makin' the hits
From the very first shipment
Red and Chuck
And the fans that love me
Mr. Magic and my man
Buggsy
The hottest D.J.'s in every town is down with the Don

A sucker emcee
In a second I'll dis
With a flick of the wrist
He'll kiss my fist
Tip his hat
And bend and bow
How ya like me now
The O.K. Corral
And the Wild Wild West
Is recreated when
Put to the test
Sparks will fly
Like the 4th of July
My name in flames
Will light the sky
Other rappers go down
Tryin' to confront me
You know where to find me
Whenever you want me
But think real hard
Before you step
And remember
I'm a vet
Runnin' the yard
Ever since grade school
Never played fool
But always stayed cool
Before you think about steppin'
I already saw ya
Step off boy
I got somethin' for ya
I'm The Don
