[Intro: Malcolm X]
We all agree tonight—all of the speakers have agreed that America has a very serious problem
Not only does America have a very serious problem but our people have a very serious problem
America's problem is...

[Chorus]
Self destruction, you're headed for self destruction
Self destruction, you're headed for self destruction
Self destruction, you're headed for self destruction
Self destruction, you're headed for self destruction

[KRS-One]
Well, today's topic, self destruction
It really ain't the rap audience that's bugging
It's one or two suckers, ignorant brothers
Trying to rob and steal from one another
You get caught in the mid
So to crush the stereotype here's what we did
We got ourselves together
So that you could unite and fight for what's right
Not negative 'cause the way we live is positive
We don't kill our relatives

[MC Delite]
Pop pop pop
One is shot, who's to blame?
Headlines, front page, and rap's the name
MC Delite here to state the bottom line
That black-on-black crime was way before our time

[Kool Moe Dee]
Took a brother's life with a knife as his wife
Cried 'cause he died a trifling death
When he left his very last breath
Was "I slept so watch your step"
Back in the sixties our brothers and sisters were hanged
How could you gang-bang?
I never ever ran from the Ku Klux Klan
And I shouldn't have to run from a black man
'Cause that's...

[Chorus]
Self destruction, you're headed for self destruction
Self destruction, you're headed for self destruction
Self destruction, you're headed for self destruction
Self destruction, you're headed for self destruction

("Uno, dos, tres, cuatro...")

[MC Lyte]
Funky fresh dressed to impress, ready to party
Money in your pocket, dying to move your body
To get inside you paid the whole ten dollars
Scotch taped with a razor blade taped to your collar
Leave the guns and the crack and the knives alone
MC Lyte's on the microphone
Bum rushing and pushing, snatching and taxing
I cram to understand why brothers don't be maxing
There's only one disco, they'll close one more
You ain't guarding the door, so what you got a gun for?
Do you rob the rich and give to the poor?
Yo Daddy-O, school em some more

[Daddy-O + Wise + both]
Straight from the mouth of Wise and Daddy-O
Do a crime, end up in jail and gotta go
'Cause you could do crime and get paid today
And tomorrow you're behind bars in the worst way
Far from your family, 'cause you're locked away
Now tell me, do you really think crime pays?
Scheming on taking what your brother had?
(You little sucker) you're talkin' all that jazz

[D-Nice]
It's time to stand together in a unity
'Cause if not then we're soon to be
Self-destroyed, unemployed
The rap race will be lost without a trace
Or a clue but what to do
Is stop the violence and kick the science
Down the road that we call eternity
Where knowledge is formed and you'll learn to be
Self-sufficient, independent
To teach to each is what rap intended
But society wants to invade
So do not walk this path they laid
It's...

[Chorus]
Self destruction, you're headed for self destruction
Self destruction, you're headed for self destruction

("D-Nice, break it down like this")
("Children grow and women produce
And men go work and some do stealing")

[Chorus]
Self destruction, you're headed for self destruction
Self destruction, you're headed for self destruction

[Ms. Melodie]
I'm Ms. Melodie and I'm a born again rebel
The violence in rap must cease and seckle
If we want to develop and grow to another level
We can't be guinea pigs for the devil
The enemy knows, they're no fools
Because everyone knows that hip-hop rules
So we gotta get a grip and grab what's wrong
The opposition is weak and rap is strong

[Doug E. Fresh]
This is all about, no doubt, to stop violence
But first let's have a moment of silence
*Fresh beatboxes*... swing
Things been stated re-educated, evaluated
Thoughts of the past have faded
The only thing left is the memories of our belated
And I hate it, when
Someone dies and gets all hurt up
For a silly gold chain by a chump (Word up)
It doesn't make you a big man (And)
To want to go out and dis your brother man (And)
You don't know that's part of the plan (Why?)
'Cause rap music is in full demand
Understand

[Chorus]
Self destruction, you're headed for self destruction

[Just-Ice]
My name is Just-Ice — a man, not a prankster
I was known as the gangster
But believe me that is no fun
The time is now to unite everyone
You don't have to be soft to be for peace
Robbing and killing and murdering is the least
You don't have to be chained by the beast
But party people it's time I release!

[Heavy D]
Ayo here's the situation: idiodicy
Nonsense, violence, not a good policy
Therefore we must ignore, fighting and fussing
Heavy's at the door so there'll be no bum-rushing
Let's get together or we'll be falling apart
I heard a brother shot another, it broke my heart
I don't understand the difficulty, people
Love your brother, treat him as an equal
They call us animals — mmm mmm, I don't agree with them
I'll prove them wrong, but right is what your proving them
Take heed before I lead to what I'm saying
Or we'll all be on our knees, praying

[Fruitkwan]
Yo Heavy D, deep in the heart of the matter
The self-destruction is served on a platter
Making a day not failing to anticipate
They got greedy so they fell for the bait
That makes them a victim, picked then plucked
New jack in jail, but to the vets they're a duck
There's no one to rob, 'cause in jail you're a number
They never took the time to wonder about

[Chorus]
Self destruction, you're headed for self destruction
Self destruction, you're headed for self destruction

[Chuck D + (Flavor Flav)]
Yes, we urge to merge, we live for the love of our people
The hope: they get along (Yeah, so we did a song)
Getting the point to our brothers and sisters
Who don't know the time (Boyyyee, so we wrote a rhyme)
Instead in your head, you know, our job
To build and collect ourselves with intellect (Come on)
To revolve, to evolve to self-respect
'Cause we got to keep ourselves in check
Or else it's...

[Chorus]
Self destruction, you're headed for self destruction
Self destruction, you're headed for self destruction
