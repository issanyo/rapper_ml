[Various Rasta Man ad lib]

[Verse One]

Just like a deadly venom
I got momentum and I'm
Seeping so deep up in'em
When I flow my flow will send them
To the bathroom, check your denim
Cause I got ya sweating in'em
It'll even change your linen
No need in need pretending
It's like an epidemic
Fear to the highest limit
It might just take forensics
To dicipher how I send this
Frenzy frantic, euphorical
Hyper panic, rhetorical
Wizard, is it historical
How you now, you sent oracles?
Sucker brothers who cover
And smother other's true lovers
A lover of a true brother
But not to dis a new comer, but
You know they just don't have it
They just can't seem to grab it
And those who thought they had it
Now know that they had got it
When you hear me now you know it
This is how your supposed to flow it
Don't try to catch the Moe, it's
Harder than you thought so go get
A couple a hundred thou-
Sand people and sit'em down
Sit back and watch me now
And I'm a show you how

[Verse Two]

I'm running and coming
Cause I can never run from them
I'm coming at them, I got them
And I'm so cunning Im stunning
I'm never humming and bumming
Get props and taking them from them
You taking it to them, I do them
And while I'm running right through them
I show them how to bo-bow
Another battle, who now
Who wants a flavor, new style
Bring on another cool child
I'll whip'em, flip'em and dip'em
Discipline'em and ship'em
Back to the drawing board
Hit'em just like a home and I get'em
Going, going, and he's gone
I'm flowing, flowing till dawn
I catch the Moe and it's on
The microphone will be torn
You wish you never were born
How could you ever perform
Because the level I'm on
Is higher than any norm
And we are just getting warm
And this is no quiet storm
I got the brain and the braun
I'm like the king, your the pawn
I'll take your queen and so long
I'll mow you down like a lawn
So if your coming, come on
And catch the Moe cause I'm gone

[Verse Three]

It's like a fever, catch it
It's heating up, match it
To fire then attach it
To any groove and scratch it
Some funky zooga-zooga
And like a coat of sugar
No Sweet N Low, I took a
Sweet flow and made a hook up
I got the rhythm, baby
I got the style, baby
I gotcha looking crazy
You're feeling wild, take me
Just like a sugar pill
A dose of real deal
Swallow the mega real
Follow the mega feel
And once you got it in ya
You'll feel it rocking in ya
Don't you get dizzy when ya
Try to slow down and then ya
Pick up the tempo (Go!)
Then watch the Moe go (Flow!)
And as the vibes (Flow!)
Put it in your endo (Yo!)
I'm already smoke'n
My float'n rope will hold'em open
Hope'n Moe can soak'em, my water flow
Can choke'em or float'em
My potent gloat'n, no joke'n
No fun, I'm coast'n
Never braking, break it, broken
My slogan: The king has spoken
