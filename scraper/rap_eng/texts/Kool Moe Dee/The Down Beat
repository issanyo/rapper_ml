The down beat
Get on the down beat

False alarm, there is no fire
The smoke you're seeing comes from my
A-stonishing rhythm combined with the beat
My voice is the smoke
My rhymes are the heat
[?] MC quench ready to burst, with flavor, a party saver
But first note; my rhymes are [?] ready to combust
Flammable to biters, so my advice is just to play

The down beat
Get on the down beat

If you wanna be down, you gotta get a down beat
But if the beat ain't funky, then the rap is obsolete
In order to be complete, or solid as concrete
You got to [?] with a funky funky downbeat

It's the down beat

When the bass is kicking
And the hi-hat's ticking
You're on a natural high, because the beat is fly
Captivating, stimulating and other [?]
And for the fresh beat lovers, we're granting your wish
And for the biters, there' s a brand new dish
So come on, eat it up, i know you're hungry
And if you want a funky beat, bon appetit
'Cause it's the down beat

The down beat

When the bass is pumping
And the snare is thumping
Rhythm takes its toll, you're out of control
You're in a trance, got to dance
When you hear the funky drum roll
That's the cue, for you to do what you want to do
Continue
So clap your hands, and stomp your feet
'Cause you can't help rocking when you hear a funky drum beat
The formula is simple, but i'm not the docs
Don't worry about the rappers, it's the beat that rocks
And if you're thinking contrary, that this ain't the truth
Look at the rappers today, they are the proof
That if you wanna get hot and feel the heat
You gotta go with the flow and change with the beat
You got to get up
On a brand new sound
But remember when you get up, the beat is down
'Cause it's the down beat

The funky down beat

Break, come on, get down

My name is Kory-O, and i'm down with the gang
The new [?] of the crew, the master of slang
I get stupid fresh, crazy, flyboy
Ultra smoking nitro [?]
Just call me up and give me a pound
High five 'cause i'm live and i know i'm down
And i got a down beat that i know will
Make all the other weak beats chill

When the bass is thumping
And the claps are [?]
The music's scratching and cutting
And it won't mean nothing
But a bass like that, that's pumping
You like the way i kick it, 'cause i can get right
'Cause i can get loose while my raps are tight
And if you came here to party before you go
Let's gonna rock the show

And it's the down beat

Get on the down beat

Hey y'all, the funky funky down beat
Come on, 'cause it's the down beat
