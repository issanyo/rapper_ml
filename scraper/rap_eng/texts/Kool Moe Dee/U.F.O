Ladies and gentlemen, boys from outer space
Treacherous Three
Space funk, U.F.O

Electro

Here we go
Here we go
Here we go
Here we go

[Verse 1]
Party people in the world
We are the kids from outer space
And we take it to the discos
And they work us in the place
We're in the venues, they all say "Ho!"
And let themselves go
Now we got em' in a space funk, and we call it U.F.O

U.F.O
U.F.O
Smokin'

Get the girl on beat, Special K
L Ease Van Shannon, the DJ
And he ain't the squirell
L-E-E, E-A-S-Y
Easy Lee, Get it?

Space it up

[Chorus]
It's an invasion of the nation
And the music in the street
Our fascinating demonstration
From the best in L.A. beat
We are the Treacherous
It's the Treacherous Three space funk
From outer space
And the song is called U.F.O
The Treacherous
It's the Treacherous Three space funk
From outer space
And the song is called U.F.O
Smokin'

U.F.O
U.F.O

[Verse 2]
U is for unique, and F is for the funky beat
And the O is for standing on
When landing on the street
Now everybody in the party
If you really want to get down
Throw your hands up and everybody say "Yeah!"
When you hear this funky sound

U.F.O
U.F.O
Smokin'

Doin' it, people

[Chorus]
T's an invasion of the nation
And the music in the street
Our fascinating demonstration
From the best in L.A. beat
We are the Treacherous
It's the Treacherous Three space funk
From outer space
And the song is called U.F.O
The Treacherous
It's the Treacherous Three space funk
From outer space
And the song is called U.F.O
