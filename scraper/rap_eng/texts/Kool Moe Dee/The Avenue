Bought a brand new car
Driving down the boulevard
Turn the corner
Like I wanna be chilin' hard
The screen is set
For me to get wet
Cause it wouldn't be right
If the ladies didn't sweat
Pull the seat back
To make contact
Eye to eye
You know I ain't living like that
I wear shades
I get paid
And when it comes to girls
And cops I can't get played
Fly girls that
Used to ignore me
I pull up
And let the car speak for me
(beep beep)
Enough said
Better hop in while the light's still red
Homeboys scatter
What's the matter
("Here come the cops")
Oh yeah that again
Rather than
Beating them down
I just talk to the men
They don't understand how I've got so much cash
Then I get mad and tell them to ask
Their daughter
I bet she bought a
Kool Moe Dee tape
For her recorder
We're not always
Thieves and thugs
And what law says
We gotta sell drugs
I get paid
And I'm making a killin'
But when I come home
I just like chillin'
On the

Avenue, a-avenue (4x)

(Action)
That's where the stars go
On the weekend
It's like a car show
Ladies flock to jock
Cars go by them
If I'm walking and talking
They ask what ya driving
When I peep that
Same old weak rap
Ask her her language
Tell her I don't speak that
Pull out a "G"
A car key and a Visa
Walk her to the car
Leave her there "see ya"
She didn't want
Nothin' else but a payday
Now she's sinking
Hollering Mayday
I knew her card
Cause two days ago
I saw that same slick girl
In a broken-down Yugo
With a hustler
Layin' low
Couldn't drive his Benz
Cause the cops said so
His homeboy got shot
In front of his crack spot
He moved cause it got too hot
But not on that block
The cops are watching
Baiting and plotting
Setting you up
For the raid in the block and
When they come
Everybody's got to go
But not Kool Moe
Cause they all know
The knot I got
Is way over their knot
But I'm working
That's why they're not
After me
They're after you
Cause I'm just chillin'
On the avenue

Avenue, a-avenue (4x)

Homeboys on the block all wanna get paid
Well, we can do this
The right way
You get money and respect
Live large and correct
Then come back driving through the neighborhood
When you look good
We all look good
Cause it's all for one
And one for all
It's got to be a better way
To get the money y'all
