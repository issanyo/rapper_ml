[Treacherous Three]
We rock, and don't stop
Well, it's the supercalifragilisticexpialidocious
With no strings attached, no bags of tricks
This is the way we get our kicks
We're qualifying, rectifying
Rock until the day we're dying
Every time you're screaming, crying
Well, we're here with no denying

[Spoonie Gee]
We hold our honor and our pride

[Special K]
Just take a step and kept in stride

[L.A. Sunshine]
We set down rules you will abide

[Kool Moe Dee]
We're gonna take you for a ride

[Spoonie Gee]
Before we're rocking as a full
Let's introduce us one by one

[Special K]
I'm Special K, I'm on display
I rock across the USA

[L.A. Sunshine]
L.A. Sunshine, I rock your mind
I do it to you every time

[Kool Moe Dee]
Remember me, MC Moe Dee
The man that's at the T-O-P

[Spoonie Gee]
I'm Spoonie Gee, as you can see
I rock the world's society
And at the end you will agree
Nobody rock the mic like me

[Treacherous Three]
But Special K, Sunshine, Moe Dee
You add us up, we'll equal three

[Spoonie Gee]
And on the mic we turn it out
Young ladies fight without a doubt

[Treacherous Three]
And if you don’t believe it’s true
Just check out how we rock for you
And if you don’t believe it’s true
Just check out how we rock for you
And if you don’t believe it’s true
Just check out how we rock for you

DO IT!

[Spoonie Gee]
Moe Dee, you got a lotta class
Well, rock a rhyme and make it fast

[Kool Moe Dee]
The super scooper, party pooper
Man with all the super-duper
Disco breaks, have what it takes
A man who never makes mistakes
A rapping lord, I'm not a bore
The baddest man you ever saw
The money-making, earth-quaking
Man who gets the party shaking

[Special K]
Undefeated, never beated
Never cheated, but succeeded
If I need it, you believe that
Rhymes are guaranteed
Wheeling, dealing, women-stealing
Casanova booty-feeling
Understanding, reprimanding
Rocking, knowing that's demanding

[L.A. Sunshine]
No complication, stimulation
Man who's gonna rock the nation
Lime rhyme, battle time
My opponent, he's all mine
I'm not the baddest, not the maddest
When I win I am the gladdest
No beginner, not a sinner
On the mic I'm just a winner

[Spoonie Gee]
Well, I'm always clean, I'm not too mean
The baddest man you ever seen
The finger-popping, non-stopping
Man who gets the party rocking
I'm so vicious and bodacious
To the young, 'cause I'm delicious
Good loving I always make
I always do with no mistake

[Kool Moe Dee]
And I'm very, very, very, berry
And my favorite flavor's cherry
Oh my God, it's fame and glory
But I never tell a story
The only time I'm on a mic
Because it's something that I like
To be assured the rhymes are lure
I always keep some sets in store

[Special K]
The bad, bad, superbad
Never sad, always glad
Not a day you find him mad
Ain't nothing I never had
Sleek, sleek, so unique
Guaranteed to move your feet
So every time I play the beat
Ladies get up off their seat

[L.A. Sunshine]
The wheeling, stealing, double-dealing
Man who rocks it on a feeling
Give you more of rhymes galore
I shoot my shot, I always score
Girls on my jock and on the lock
The man who rock around the clock
I never date, I never wait
The man who set the people straight

[Spoonie Gee]
Well I'm Spoonie Gee, as you could see
I rock the whole society
I always rock, as you can tell
I rock with all the clientele
Finesse is do you know I will
I keep the people staring still
Eyes swollen, rhymes tolling
Coming out this microphone

[Kool Moe Dee]
Remember me, MC Moe Dee
The man that's at the T-O-P
A ladies dream the way it seem
When they see me, their eyes are gleaming
I'm so shocking when I'm rocking
Bound to get your fingers popping
Have no doubt, I turn it out
'Cause that's a party's all about

[Special K]
Equal sharing, always caring
Man who rhymes with all the daring
Satisfaction guaranteed
Giving you just what you need
I'm Special K with all the planning
Known to be the most outstanding
When I look into the mirror
Knowing there's no one sincere-er

[L.A. Sunshine]
A [?], that'll do it
I don't need some disco fluid
Ball-playing, girl-laying
On the mic I'm rhyme-saying
MC who rock viciously
Satisfaction guaranteed
Or you'll get your money back
Believe me, girl, it's not the wack

[Spoonie Gee]
Well, I'm indeed the one that leave
With any girl I wish to see
That make her smile and never frown
'Cause I'm the man who get on down
Have everybody feel they face
And give their tongue a taste
Don't try to make 'em scream and shout
Just show 'em what it's all about

[Treacherous Three]
Treacherous Three as you can see

[Special K]
Special K

[L.A. Sunshine]
Sunshine

[Kool Moe Dee]
And Kool Moe Dee

[Spoonie Gee]
And don't forget MC Spoonie Gee

[Special K]
For MCs who bite
The fast-talking rhymes
They're gonna feast
So get ready to eat
Moe Dee's the originator
So you might as well starve
'Cause you can't catch this fast beat
(Hit it, Moe)

[Kool Moe Dee]
Hey, diddle-diddle on the fiddle
'Cause the cat is in the middle
Will he rhyme or will he riddle
Does he want a tender vittle
Have a lot, may be a little
Low cause he can feel his middle
And an ocean full of lotion
'Cause it's like his magic potion
But my notion's that the potion
Work itself up like a motion
When you're catching Superman
And you don't seem to understand
Instead of high he's at the aisle
[?] plenty [?]
But the cat was found missing somewhere on the line
The only thing he hears is being deaf because of Kool Moe Dee
Or walkin' on a leash or whether talkin' on the street
Whether north or south or east
Or whether human or a beast
I'm so full of disco power!
It ain't a MC that I can't devour!
In a hour talking fast and he goes sour
Moe Dee, the disco tower power
So take a deep breath, get a drink of water
Special K, you can say it, but make yours shorter

[Special K]
Well, I'm so sincere, just sincere
The baddest MC of the year
Say it low, say it loud
Say it special, say it proud
Taking every year in hell
I weigh the highest on the scale
When I rock I take a bow
Sunshine, come on and show 'em how

[L.A. Sunshine]
The girl-teasing, woman-pleasing
Take a girl, others freezing
Got the heart to play the part
I'm not too sweet, I'm not too tart
We're rapping to the funky beat
The kids all chowed like us like a treat
So come on then and get a taste
Believe me, girl, it's not a waste

[Kool Moe Dee]
The super-rhyming, fascinating
Faster rhyme originating
Number one when I'm creating
Number one with no debating
If you look up on the rating
You will see that you're degrading
And you're only commentating
And that gets to be frustrating

[Special K]
Yes, for real, we are the deal
And on the mic we use our skill
The latest, greatest, no one hate us
Take us home, we're gold-plated
Rapping raw and never bore
And always keep you on the floor
And rock and roll and take control
And rock until we're grey and old

[L.A. Sunshine]
The law-abiding, never fighting
Girls around are never hiding
Pain-enduring, love-ensuring
Cool, calm, and most alluring
Can't stop on the jock
The man who make the party rock
I gratify and satisfy
Girl, just say, just say good-bye

[Spoonie Gee]
Well, I'm letting you know I am a pro
Just give me a mic, I'm on the go

[Treacherous Three]
The three MCs that never freeze
That rock you on down to your knees

[Spoonie Gee]
Like Earl the Pearl that shocked the world
Spoonie Gee attracts a girl

[Treacherous Three]
We're cool and calm and have the charm
Young ladies say we mean no harm

[Spoonie Gee]
S-P-O-O-N-Y Gee

[Special K]
S-P-E-C-I-A-L K

[L.A. Sunshine]
The S-U-N-S-H-I-N-E

[Treacherous Three]
Moe Dee, all the way, y'all

[Kool Moe Dee]
To the South, to the West, to the East, to the North
(Come on, Moe Dee, yeah go off, and go off)
Well, I can shock ya and amaze ya
Then I hit ya, then I daze ya
Either way I'm gonna faze ya
But I never ever praise ya
'Cause that is your own behaviour
And of course it's in our favor
And since you're on the jock, you can choose your favorite flavor
If you don't know what's the matter
We can serve ya on a platter
And for your delight, well, we can add a little batter
To the south, to the west, to the east, to the north
Come on, Special K, and go off, and go off

[Special K]
'Cause we're a top organization
And we're here to rock the nation
We need cooperation to perform this devastation
Have you swinging, have you swaying
On the mic, and I'll be saying
No more joking, no more playing
We rock with no delaying
From the South to the West, to the East, to the North
Come on, Sunshine, go off and go off

[L.A. Sunshine]
Say rag-tag, garbage bag
Other MCs know the half
With no permission they all listen
Get their rods and they go fishing
To the bottom of the pod and bite our rhymes
No matter how the party people know we rock
So they can stay all on the jock

[Special K]
From the South to the West, to the East, to the North
Come on, Moe Dee, go off, go off

[Kool Moe Dee]
And to the D-A-N-O B
Well, Dano B is at the T-O-P
The Superstar, as you can see
The slicker, quicker, magic tricker
On the mixer there's no one quicker
Any sign of magic tricks
There's no man quicker on the mix
Go by the name of the Superstar
So young ladies (ho!) from near or far
Or whether you're high-class or rather bourgeois
Whether you live close or you live far
Or whether bus, by train, or even car
You better come and check out the Superstar
It's Dano B, deejay for me
You say 'cause my presentation when I'm in the nation
Causes total fascination and a total jubilation
With your cooperation and your participation
Don't give no complication, check out acceleration
Talking faster every second
Other MCs now I reckon
You will wanna bite and chew
Sit back, listen, what you do
Get your pencil, papers and pad
You listen to me like I was your dad
Gonna write the rhymes down to 'Rhymes Galore'
Better tally it up like it was a score
And when it comes to the fly girls, all the things you were taught
You see a pretty young lady, but have second thought
Because her face is on, but her body ain't so hot
Now maybe you should have her or maybe not
Well, if you rather have a bunch of [?] upon a [?]
[?] 'cause she's just a freak
No way that you can reach your peak
On a girl who conversate
And make sure that her head is straight
But when she don't participate
The other girl is not too late
Take it light, because you're blue
Think about it, what you do
Think about it like a man
And someday you will understand
Sex-sex-sex is the law-law-law
When a guy gets a girl on the floor-floor-floor
He sticks his information into her communication
And for further information try the Board of Education
The Army, the Navy, United States Nation
Let's rock, y'all, and don't stop
Ya keep on and shock the house

[Treacherous Three]
Because we rock non-stop
Because we rock non-stop
Because we rock non-stop
Because we rock non-stop
Because we rock non-stop
Because we rock non-stop
Because we rock non-stop
Because we rock non-stop
Because we rock non-stop (Spoonie Gee's gonna...)
Because we rock non-stop (Special K's gonna...)
Because we rock non-stop (Moe Dee's gonna...)
Because we rock non-stop (Sunshine's gonna...)
