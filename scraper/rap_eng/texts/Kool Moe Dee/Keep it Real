I know you know I got the hip-hop, non-stop
Body-rockin mad props, I got
Parties clockin minds, not cheap shots
Because I'm droppin flavor
I'm keepin it real

I got to hit you with the fat beats that keeps
The heads shakin as we smash these
Flakes makin cash, we crash these
Straigh fakin gangsters
I'm keepin it real

I'm the educated, underrated, overstated
Suckers made it, suckers played it, suckers raided
Don't you hate it how they faded
All the great except the latest
Style created by the greatest
Rappin, rhymin, rhythmic climbin
Funky timin, rhyme designin
Lyric chimin, hard as diamond
Yes, it's mine and I'm inclinin
Mind to rhyme, and I ain't layin
I'm keepin it real

I never hit you with the fake hard barn yard
Country bumpkin facade, bogart
Bunch of frontin upstart, undercarred
Up-and-comin rappers, yo
I'm keepin it real

I'm tired of hearin all the bang-bang
Same thang as everybody shots ring
Gangs gain momentum as the rap game's slang change
And ain't nobody really
Keepin it real

I'm the innovating, motivating
Stimulating, elevating, resonnating
Renovating, emulating, perpetrating
Combinating, denegrading
Escalating, dominating
Insane, mondaine, no name lame brain
Rappers came to entertain
The same game, gain fame
And get a name, but ain't nobody
Keepin it real

I'm never comin with the fly guy, get high
Image of a rye dry white lie
Givin us a closed eye, why die
Before I hit the heavens, yo
I'm keepin it real

I got to get it while I'm on Earth, re-birth
My ancestors were here first, dispersed
By what you heard with each verse I reversed
The image of a ghetto, yo
Keepin it real

No stereotypical, nothin is typical
Comin like a God or a mythical figure, my visual's
Somethin like a magical mystical force of residuals
On the mic I'm flier than digital, more like a ???
I drop it like a Amville, stand still
Sit back and watch a man build and chill
As I proceed the plan will slam, kill
Anybody aimin, yo
I'm keepin it real

Keepin it real
