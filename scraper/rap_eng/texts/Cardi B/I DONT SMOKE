Lets see what we can do

Hook:
I dont smoke, i dont freaking smoke no no
Thats a tackler for my freaking songs yo
Cos im broke, its so hard to smoke
So you know i dont freaking smoke woah woah

Refrain:
I dont smoke, i dont freaking smoke no no
I dont smoke, i dont freaking smoke no no
I dont smoke, i dont freaking smoke no no
So you know i dont freaking smoke woah

Verse:
Ain't waste my time and energy on something
That never gon bring me the money
I put in, im in it for something
If you like to waste it, then kiss it, and leave it alive
But open your eyes and open your mind so when you will die
Nothing gon wish you goodbye
Recognize, realize
You spent your life on em, nah

You gon die
My apologize
So better try
Before rising to the skies!
You should know, not every rapper smokes
I ain't like the most, im different
You may think so, cos i look so close
And i dress so cold while im suffering

My face went cardi b when i knew what your morning tea is
When you wake up smoking, pouring drink and boring drinking
Going blind and never thinking, what is up and what is ringing
Its your mind telling you blink blink im done, my job has ended

I dont smoke weed
Id rather go feed my speed
At preaching, jesus, im freezing
Was bleeding last year, now im feeling
My face and my wheels are wheeling
Please please me i gotta read these
So i dont blow up easily and i dont reach
My dream of being me
On the tv

This beat is so freaking wavy for geazy
So feel it im in it for things with reason
Nothing comes easy, neither the cheese or the beef
And you spend it all on weed? yeah you, thought me?
(you dont know!?)

Hook:
I dont smoke, i dont freaking smoke no no
Thats a tackler for my freaking songs yo
Cos im broke, its so hard to smoke (woah woah)
So you know i dont freaking smoke woah woah

I dont
I dont i dont
I dont

Refrain:
I dont smoke, i dont freaking smoke no no
I dont smoke, i dont freaking smoke no no
I dont smoke, i dont freaking smoke no no
So you know i dont freaking smoke woah
