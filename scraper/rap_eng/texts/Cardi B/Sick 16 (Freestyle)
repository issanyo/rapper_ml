They out here looking for revenge
All day, all night
See me not once but twice
All looks and no fights
See me doing me got em wondering how a bitch came a took flight
They talk about me all night
God damn they must be tight
They looking for revenge

[Verse 1]
Yeah, it's not my fault tho
I swear I just do me and bitches be sick, bitches got sore throats
Last year I was on the pole
Now you can catch ya girl on the road
Damn near 15k a show
I think some bitches need to know, yeah
Cause I don't brag much
But shit really be a blow
When I got bitches that's coming for me like we on the same level, that's a no
These bitches is nowhere near my level
Can't even fit em in my schedule
Yeah your girl is overbooked
You really think my attention's gonna catch you
Mixtape been out for 3 weeks
And already charting on Billboards
For really think that shit was free
All I gotta say is "thank you Lord"
This is for the ones that was doubting me
And said I was never gon be shit
All of a sudden they proud of me
And wanna be hopping on my dick
They six, six, six
Yeah, sick, sick, sick, cause they know wassup
I'm usually always humble but right now I really don't give a fuck
Some niggas be hating hard
Why is it because you didn't buck?
Cause you didn't get the time a day?
And I left ya lame ass in the dust
Oh man, oh man
If you hittas pulling straight fam on
They saying I'm the next superstar
Co-signed by Lee Daniels
Im just tryna play this game clever
I'm just tryna do that shit right
So I hit em wit that "Foreva"
Ran down on that bitch twice

[Cardi B]
Know I don't really brag much, but bitches better stop fucking playing with me like I can't stunt on a bitch
Like, like y'all think, y'all think I'm playing with my pussy all day long or something
You know what, bring that back
Mm

[Verse 2]
I know some bitches in the Bronx that wanna be me a little
But stop on learning how to suck and fuck and live free a little
And bitch know your worth, don't show it all, let em see a little
And if he ain't bout the money, hit the brakes, but do speed a little
I remember having no money, sleeping at my ex house
My mom couldn't take me at the time, so she had to kick me out
But I'm not mad at her one bit, cause I don't think I would've took this route
I had to go get it on my own
Im just glad I figured it out
Like I been through a lot
And it wasn't easy to escape
That's why it really bothers me when motherfuckers got something to say
And just to set the record straight
[?] to stop a J
If they ain't SwiftOnDemand, then they ain't help me in no way
I swear they be wanting so much credit
But don't wanna give none when it's due
Slept on ya girl for so long
Now wanna come hopping out the blue
Nah bruh shit don't work like that
Well at least it don't in my book
Cause if you fuck with me hard, and I fuck with you, then there's no other way to look
Imma hit em again and again
Get so much music, it go to ya friend
Hitting a tour and the shade gon end
Hmm that's why they looking for revenge
