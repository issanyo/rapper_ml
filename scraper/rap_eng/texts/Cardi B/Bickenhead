From across the globe, woo (Hol' up)
This goes for all my nasty hoes, yeah
(Alright-alright, alright, alright, alright, alright)
From across the globe, look, uh

[Verse 1]
Now, I said luxury apartments (Wow)
I'm young and I'm heartless (Yeah)
There's a bitch that's in my vision, that bitch is a target (Brrr)
Lawyer is a Jew, he gon' chew up all the charges
Don't matter if you fuck with me, I get money regardless (cash)

[Chorus]
That guap, guap, get some chicken
Guap, guap, get some bread
Guap, guap, get some chicken
Guap, guap, get some bread
Bitch you pressed, you can flex
Get some money, ho, tell me why you stressed

[Verse 2]
Now I said, hoes down, Gs up (Gs up)
You know how I'm rockin', but my watch is freezed up (Ice!)
I can't wait until they drop that Lamborghini truck (skrrt!)
I'm careful where I park it, hoes will have it keyed up
Them bitches getting beat up (Brrrat!)
Slim waist, ass fat (fat), my shit is caked up
My bad bitch at the bake (yeah), without no makeup
This that collard greens, cornbread, neck bone, back fat
Get it from my mama and you don't know where your daddy at
Knick-knack, paddywhack, give a dog a bone (Bone)
Put it on him, then your nigga never comin' home (Home)
I'ma flex like a 'roid, I'm a ten, she a 'droid
Stupid ho, unimportant, unattractive, unemployed

[Chorus]
Get some guap, guap, get some chicken
Guap, guap, get some bread
Guap, guap, get some chicken
Guap, guap, get some bread
Bitch, you pressed, you can flex
Get some money, ho, tell me why you stressed, uh
Guap, guap, get some chicken

[Refrain]
I need that cheese, shorty
Show me where it's at (boy, please, whatever)
You play with me (Guap-guap, chicken-chicken)
I might pop up where you at (boy, please, whatever)
You make-believe (Guap-guap, chicken-chicken)
Now with me it's only facts (boy, please, whatever)
Expensive weave, and my checks is worth some racks, uh

[Verse 3]
Yeah, pop that pussy like you ain't popped that pussy in a while
Pop that pussy like poppin' pussy is goin' out of style
Pop that pussy while you work, pop that pussy up at church
Pop that pussy on the pole, pop that pussy on the stove
Make that pussy slip and slide, like you from the 305
Put your tongue out in the mirror, pop that pussy while you drive
Spread them asscheeks open, make that pussy crack a smile
Lock your legs 'round that nigga, make him give your ass a child (woo)
Gimme some neck, gimme a check
Pussy so good, make a nigga invest
Get a little spit, I'm gettin' it wet
I'll get it back up, just give me a sec'
Give him some vag', I'm gettin' a bag
Give him some ass, I'm gettin' some Raf
When I'm done, I make him cum, but then he comin' off that cash

[Chorus]
Get you some guap, guap, get some chicken
Guap, guap, get some bread
Guap, guap, get some chicken
Guap, guap, get some bread
Bitch, you pressed, you can flex
Get some money, ho, tell me why you stressed, uh
Guap, guap, get some chicken

[Refrain]
I need that cheese, shorty
Show me where it's at (boy, please, whatever)
You play with me (Guap-guap, chicken-chicken)
I might pop up where you at (boy, please, whatever)
You make-believe (Guap-guap, chicken-chicken)
Now with me it's only facts (boy, please, whatever)
Expensive weave, and my checks is worth some racks, uh

[Outro]
Alright-alright, alright, alright, alright, alright
Alright-alright, alright, alright, alright, alright
Alright-alright, alright, alright, alright, alright
Alright-alright, alright, alright, alright, alright
