[Chorus]
Ran down on that bitch twice
Ran down on that bitch twice
You know me I be with whatever
If a bitch beef with me we gon' beef foreva
Ran down on that bitch twice
Ran down on that bitch twice
You know me I be with whatever
If a bitch beef with me we gon' beef foreva

[Verse 1]
Why you always tryna run and hide
Always have my name up in your mouth you outta line
You gon' make me pop up at your door like surprise
Like come outside lil' bitch come outside
Never by my lonely got my niggas by my side
And all my niggas skrr skrr yeah they down to ride
Yeah my bitches go to work I'm talking 9 to 5
The streets want to fuck around you won't stay alive
Your man can cross you and I make sure that you pay the price
So don't be lacking when you coming home from work at night
You run your mouth I poppin out now it's on sight
You gon' be just like my pussy hella tight
A hoe can hate but don't be fucking with my commas
And if she is I'll shape her up and she gon' get the line up
Can't be starting all these problems if you cannot solve em
Cardi backing down I swear to God that's not an option

[Chorus]
Ran down on that bitch twice
Ran down on that bitch twice
You know me I be with whatever
If a bitch beef with me we gon' beef foreva
Ran down on that bitch twice
Ran down on that bitch twice
You know me I be with whatever
If a bitch beef with me we gon' beef foreva

[Verse 2]
Some bitches claim they with the shits but they ain't with a thing
I spin the block come around like a boomerang
Silence silence I don't hear a thing
Worry about me but your pussy smell like turtle tank
I pull up on that check nothing less that's all I do
10 bands 50 bands ain't nothing new
I see some people who still worried about my revenue
I'm eating good you wish you could don't worry about my food
And niggas hating on a female ain't no way to live
You bitch made make me wonder if you got a dick
How you feeling like a man envying a chick
Wake up and go get some money go and find your niche
Silly muthafucka who raised you
A nigga with a pussy how disgraceful
I have my hittas come and duck tape you
And your bitch could get it too double date boo
So let's get it so let's get it so let's get it let's not waste a minute
You clearly started so let's finish
I don't do forgiveness, they take your kindness for a gimmick
I'm just here for business
I'm running down and I'm with it

[Chorus]
Ran down on that bitch twice
Ran down on that bitch twice
You know me I be with whatever
If a bitch beef with me we gon' beef foreva
Ran down on that bitch twice
Ran down on that bitch twice
You know me I be with whatever
If a bitch beef with me we gon' beef foreva
