[Hook: Jennifer Lopez & DJ Khaled]
Me and Benjamín Franco stay at the banco
Getting checks like Nike, everywhere that I go
If you ain't getting no pesos, ¿qué estás haciendo? (J-Lo)
Stack it up like Legos, quiero dinero (another one)

[Verse 1: Jennifer Lopez & DJ Khaled]
Me and my man, we stack it up to the ceiling (more money)
Cállate la boca, let me finish (more money)
Every day I'm alive, I make a killing (let's get it)
Yeah, I swear I'ma get it (get it)

[Chorus: Jennifer Lopez & DJ Khaled, Both]
Yo quiero, yo quiero dinero, ay
Yo quiero, yo quiero dinero, ay
I just want the green, want the money, want the cash flow
Yo quiero la venta, sí, sin cuenta, sí, lo siento
Yo quiero, yo quiero dinero, ay
Yo quiero, yo quiero dinero, ay
I just want the green, want the money, want the cash flow
Yo quiero la venta, sí, sin cuenta, sí, lo siento

[Post-Chorus]
Yo quiero, yo quiero dinero, ay
Want the money, want the
Want the money, want the
Cash cash flow, cash flow, flow

[Verse 2: Jennifer Lopez & DJ Khaled]
Soy la Princesa, San Juan, Puerto Rico
They say money talk, but my talking bilingual
I should be cuffed, though, 'cause I don't do singles
In love with the money, so no need to mingle (let's ride)
Just back it up, hot talk, yeah, back it up
Holla at that if you actin' up
You ain't got that, you can't sit with us, yeah
Designer frames make you double take
Ben and Andy on a double date
Grant just hit me, said he on the way

[Chorus: Jennifer Lopez & DJ Khaled, Both]
Yo quiero, yo quiero dinero, ay
Yo quiero, yo quiero dinero, ay
I just want the green, want the money, want the cash flow
Yo quiero la venta, sí, sin cuenta, sí, lo siento (Cardi B, Cardi B)

[Verse 3: Cardi B]
Look, they gon' do what I say so, Cardi B and J. Lo
Talk behind my back, but never up in my face, though
I just want my money, chips, guac, and queso
Y'all can kiss my ass, dame un beso
I spice it up, I'm like sofrito
I need my money, yo necesito
I told y'all, I'm trap Selena
I'll backhand a bitch like Serena
We need the guap, run up in your spot
Put it to your head like, "Give me what you got"
Two bad bitches that came from the Bronx
Cardi from the pole and Jenny from the block (block)

[Partial Chorus]
Dinero, di- (Dinero)
I just want the dinero, di- (Dinero)
I just want the dinero, dinero
I just want the dinero, dinero
Yo quiero, yo quiero dinero

[Post-Chorus]
Want the money, want the
Want the money, want the
Cash cash flow, cash flow, flow
Want the money, want the
Want the money, want the
Cash cash flow, cash flow, flow
Yo quiero, yo quiero dinero
