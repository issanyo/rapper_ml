[Verse 1: CashFlow Harlem]
How ya doin' miss? My name is Flow and I'm from Harlem
I'd like to talk to you for a sec if not a problem
I ain't like those dudes you involved with
There's a difference between a dude that wants your number
And the guy that she callin'
And I be your blessin'
Shinin' bright like the VVS
And girl I keep 'em guessin'
Movin' moves, yeah I be finessin'
I'm talkin' Mel Gibson, Danny Glover, yeah Lethal Weapon
Baby girl she a rider, we don't put no GPS in, nah
We just pull up to the scene
I don't want a thot, nah I'm lookin' for a queen
Baby girl dope without usin' the drugs
I just got one question girl, who do you love?

[Verse 2: CashFlow]
Girl tell me who you with, tell me who you love
Relationship on life support, I came to pull the plug
The nigga you was with back then, he a dub
I'm Curry in 4th quarter for 3, I come up clutch
You my Ayesha, fly diva with five features
Bout to set it off with this queen, no Latifah
So when it hit the fan and that's when my broad creeped up
Pocket dial, she heard everything and had it on speaker, damn

[Verse 3: Cardi B]
Boy tell me who you love, who you wanna be with
Let your girl know it's no need to keep a secret
This thing is like a contract, make sure that you read it
Cause if we fuck once then you signed that agreement, yeah
Now baby look me in my eyes, look me in my eyes
Got a girl tell, come outside, saw her come outside
Yeah, so now your bitch is a dub
So let me know right now nigga, who do you love?
