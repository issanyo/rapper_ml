[Intro: Cardi B & Offset]
Ya dig?
Yeah
Lookin' like I caught a (Look at me)
Cardi (Look at me)

Woah

[Chorus: Cardi B & Offset]
Lookin' like I caught a lick (lick, hey!)
Run up on me, you get hit
And all my bitches with the shits (yeah!)
Bronx, New York, gangsta bitch (woo, woo)
Lookin' like I caught a lick (yeah)
Since Day 1, I've been that bitch (hey)
Got some hittas in my clique
Lookin' like I caught a lick (woo, woo, Offset!)
Lookin' like I caught a lick

[Verse 1: Offset]
They know they can't stop a G
Bitch do not talk to me (yeah)
Diamonds start hittin', she swallow me (shine)
Play with these racks like Monopoly (racks)
Make her say uh like Master P
Bought the Patek Phillipe, no that bitch wasn't cheap (no)
These niggas is pussy, they is what they eat (woo)
Show after show, I've been countin' all week (woo)
Lamborghini, I just ordered up three (skrrt, skrrt)
Lookin' like I hit a lick and fuckin' on a badder bitch
Fuckin' on your daughter, ask me how I get the water wrist
Think he poppin' hard but he really wanna take a pic (flash)
He can't even believe I done got rich
Woke up this mornin', I'm countin' this money
This water drip off me, a fountain or somethin' (water)
These bitches and niggas not 'mountin' to nothin' (nah)
I keep countin' this money, I keep countin' this money (hey!)

[Pre-Chorus: Cardi B]
Run up, get done up
Got shooters ready for a come up
Promise you I didn't luck up
Was grindin' all night
Didn't sleep 'til the sun up
Now I got up on my shit
Walk around like I'm that bitch
Every nigga wanna hit

[Chorus: Cardi B & Offset]
Lookin' like I caught a lick (lick, hey!)
Run up on me, you get hit
And all my bitches with the shits (yeah!)
Bronx, New York, gangsta bitch (woo, woo)
Lookin' like I caught a lick (yeah)
Since Day 1, I've been that bitch (hey)
Got some hittas in my clique
Lookin' like I caught a lick (woo, woo, woo)
Lookin' like I caught a lick

[Verse 2: Cardi B]
Look at me, look at me
They ain't like me before, now they bookin' me
The glow up got bitches so shook at me
They like, "Chef Cardi B, what you cookin', B?"
I say, "Bitches, got me on some new shit"
I swear niggas got me feelin' ruthless
Too much mo'fuckers done doubted me
That's why I had to just prove it
I remember walkin' in the stores, I couldn't buy nothin'
They look at me stank
Now I just walk in the stores, I like it I cop it
I don't even think
Bank tellers asking for info
'Cause now my deposits on Kimbo
Told that bitch, "Gimme my money
Why the fuck you askin' all this info?"

[Pre-Chorus: Cardi B]
Run up, get done up
Got shooters ready for a come up
Promise you I didn't luck up
Was grindin' all night
Didn't sleep 'til the sun up
Now I got up on my shit
Walk around like I'm that bitch
Every nigga wanna hit

[Chorus: Cardi B & Offset]
Lookin' like I caught a lick (lick, hey!)
Run up on me, you get hit
And all my bitches with the shits (yeah!)
Bronx, New York, gangsta bitch (woo, woo)
Lookin' like I caught a lick (yeah)
Since Day 1, I've been that bitch (hey)
Got some hittas in my clique
Lookin' like I caught a lick (woo, woo, woo, woo)
Lookin' like I caught a lick

[Outro: Cardi B]
Look at me
