[Intro]
YB on da beat

[Chorus: Shabazz PBG]
I'm off two percs I don't fuck with the xans
I got a Glock and I know it won't jam
Switched the flow up, these hoes know I'm the man
I got them packs and the A on demand
I got the deals like a coupon
Your nigga in the trap but that boy a pawn
Shoot from long range with the fully AR
I'm a starter, he just shoot at the stars
He sipping fu' but he think he sip quali'
Sticks on me like I play the Timbali
Bad bitch named Holly, she in love with molly
Go to Cali sippin' lean, no Bacardi
Red bitch and she look just like Cardi B
I got a check now these lil' bitches follow me
Ran it up, now these lil 'bitches swallow me
Hundred rounds in that new SRT

[Verse 1: Shabazz PBG]
They want some clout so they copy me
My name in his mouth, his main bitch toppin' me
Do this shit for Don so it ain't no stopping me
Rest in peace now, pour a four in a cream
Tae Dawg sleep, he addicted to lean
Molly pink but your main bitch is green
Tuck in a Glock, it just fucked up my jeans
Double G on me, I shoot for the team
Bro got glasses, fuck a beam
He want it clean but I served him fake lean
Plugged in with bars so I got the double G's
She popped a molly then dropped to her knees
Hop out the car then I squeeze
Bro got a fully AR in the Jeep
I'm in the Benz and my side bitch a freak
Don't got a bitch so I fly every week
Keep the Glock on me cause I know they plottin'
Think I like your bitch 'cause she keep on watchin' me
Count about hundred, you know I got broccoli
Shoot, score, nigga Charles Barkley
Ain't have a porch had to jump off the balcony
I'm in Atlanta like Falcons and Hawks wit me
Slide on your block
I'm Tony Hawk and shit
PBG and OTD we be stalkin' shit
Send them shootas to your house if you talkin' shit
Fuck a drive-by you know we be walkin' shit
Hol' up
Hop out the car I got double clip
Glock 30S and it came wit' a rubber grip
Cut that nigga off 'cause he on some sucker shit
Nigga, fuck the rap game
I get a check then I double it

[Chorus: Shabazz PBG]
I'm off two percs I don't fuck with the xans
I got a Glock and I know it won't jam
Switched the flow up, these hoes know I'm the man
I got them packs and the A on demand
I got the deals like a coupon
Your nigga in the trap but that boy a pawn
Shoot from long range with the fully AR
I'm a starter, he just shoot at the stars
He sipping fu' but he think he sip quali'
Sticks on me like I play the Timbali
Bad bitch named Holly, she in love with molly
Go to Cali sippin' lean, no Bacardi
Red bitch and she look just like Cardi B
I got a check now these lil' bitches follow me
Ran it up, now these lil 'bitches swallow me
Hundred rounds in that new SRT

[Verse 2: Cardi B]
Catch you outside bitch, I catch you inside
Whip more expensive than your nigga ride
Pockets on heavy, I'm rockin' them Mary Jeans
Bitches is pussy, these bitches is scared of me
Peep from me, bitch I turn you to a play
The sack on my wrist, yeah I look like a stain
I suck on a nigga then I rob his chain
The Glock is too hot like I just left the range
Bang, b-b-b-b-b-bang
I fuck with him still but it's just not the same
He stood for me good and he good for the bank
A red little bitch and I'm hard to maintain (gang)
Bang, b-b-b-b-b-bang
I fuck with him still but it's just not the same
He stood for me good and he good for the bank
A red little bitch and I'm hard to maintain (gang)

[Chorus: Shabazz PBG]
