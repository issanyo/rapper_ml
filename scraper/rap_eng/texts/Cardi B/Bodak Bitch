[Intro]
Bodak, bitch
Bitch i'm gonna drive you loco
Hahahahaha...

[Chorus]
You little bitch, your man fucks with me cause he don't want you
Your shit is fake, this is real bottom, I'm his boo not you
You should know, me nah stop take the man so stop tell him fi choose
Fi tell you the truth, you look like a bloodclaat mongoose, bitch
Inna the bedroom, this is how I move
Bumpa jump pon the buddy like jacks that's how I get him in the groove
So why you think couple months now the man ain't fuck with you
Cause I'm the boss, you the worker, bitch
You slip, you slide, you loose

[Verse]
Now she say she can keep the man from me? Let's find out and see
Cause my pussy really tiny like the eyes on the bee
When me put this pon top of him dick it's like he want's to marry me
He be in and out my hole so much and still ain't tired of me
Honestly, you favor the geico lizard I see on TV
Straight like tree, no sex appeal, bitch you don't look as good as me
I don't bother with this hoe, so why the fuck you follow me?
Watch my captions, pics, my videos, bitch stop live pon my IG
Bloodclaat, me not even know weh fi start, man can't even carry you go flaunt
Look like a old donkey cart, man say you smell like a fart
Don't even want us to part, I'm like, "Okay"
I let him do what he wants, fuck me in the kitchen, the back
We mad in love, like Mona Scott Young and Shawn
I'm telling you, I have his heart
Got your man up in my sheets, I'm sure, I know you heard of me
Down to him granny, all the dog a him yard, everybody fonder me
And I cook, we eat, we chill, me make you nyam bare headache pill
All when you find out you haffi bill cause our man a fuck me still

[Chorus]
