[Verse : Oliver Twixt]

Fuck boys on the slick can’t address Twist
Talk shit, we pulling up to your address quick
Young prince with a bigger corvette
I keep a check and a plug with a couple connects
I know a couple big wigs, only roll with the best
So my figures never hidden, money (monae) I collect
I Hit an X to the L so I'm punting the blunt
So fuck a fuck pussy nigga with his thumb in the butt
Blowing it up - I trigger that smoke
You the back door, no, you're never front row
Fucking average like you jimmy hat joe
Ball sacks is where you ever gone blow
Yeah the sax fifth ave gimme that cloak
Flame a bird bitch but I never eat crow
Keep my figures up, trigger tuck, money moving run a muck
Claim you straight thugging but you bitches stay coupled up
OH! Lil fella a ten
Came outta undergrad with the highest regards
Ain't made it big yet but i get the loudest applause
The oos and aws so cool down bitch, man you been a fan
Evident, tryna settle in on my settlement
Keeps my eyesez where the ice is, Taliban
Decadent, hittas stay drumming with a bigger band
Galavant - Caucasian jetting to a wetter land
Pelican - Tucan feathered on a elephants
Pay for Late night D for I let em in (Letterman)
Benjamin, old white faces in my button up
Known to roll with a couple of bitches who don't give a fuck
Intricate, every cut, edition - limited
Little Black American prince - yeah I'm living it
Say the little fag stay running off with a bigger bag
Better watch for you get snatched like gimme that
OOOH! I'm the cooliest
'Scuse me bitch, yes I'm the boogiest
The too legit, you never can fool me trick
Top of the class, you never can school me bitch
Oooh! You mad huh cause I spend big and I eat nice - mhm
You mad huh 'cause I’m big bitch like k price - mhm
You mad huh 'cause your bae blowing this bomb shell
