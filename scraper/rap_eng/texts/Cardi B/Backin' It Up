[Intro: Pardison Fontaine & Cardi B]
Ahhh
Cardi!
Turn around, fuck it all the way up
Bust it down, turn around, fuck it all the way up
Bust it down, turn around, fuck itâ€”look

[Verse 1: Pardison Fontaine]
Let's get it straight, girl, you don't need a nigga for nothin'
Lookin' better every day, you got that Benjamin Button
Claimin' he don't got a girl, you know niggas be frontin'
You don't need no bitch comin' up to you as a woman (Ayy)
And you a boss, so you hate when niggas waste time (Ayy)
You too pretty to be paused on the FaceTime (Ayy)
Damn, I'm just statin' the facts
You hate that like you hate when niggas tell you, "Relax"
What the fuck you mean, "Relax"?
You want somethin' more than just physical (Word)
It's been a while since you met someone original (Word)
You spend your time drinkin' wine in your livin' room
All that good pussy, can't find the one to give it to (What?)
Issa, issa shame (issa shame)
You see me, see the squad, issa gang (Issa gang)
You see him, issa bum, issa lame (Issa lame)
But issa difference 'tween me and what's-his-name (Ayy)
I swear to God, word to Mase (Ayy)
I'ma drink this Henny to the face (Ayy)
Fuck a condom, I'ma bring Saran Wrap
I can't let no good pussy go to waste (Ayy)

[Chorus: Pardison Fontaine & Cardi B]
Back, back-backin' it up
I'm the king of talkin' shit, then backin' it up (Ayy)
Back, back-backin' it up
Throw that shit over here, girl, that's what it's for (What you say?)
You know how to go and get a bag, don't you? (Ayy)
You know how to make a bitch mad, don't you (Ayy)
Make your ex wanna get it back, that's a fact
Say it louder for the bitches in the back (Ayy)
I know how to go and get a bag, don't I (Don't I)
I know how to get a bitch mad, don't I (Yeah)
Make my ex wanna get it back, that's a fact
Say it louder for the bitches in the back (Ayy)
Back, back-backin' it up
I'm the queen of talkin' shit, then I'm backin' it up (Yeah)
Back, back-backin' it up
Throw that money over here, nigga, that's what it's for (What you say?)

[Verse 2: Cardi B]
Look, said I was gettin' some head, get-gettin' some head
Ran down on a bitch, she almost pissed on her leg
Bitches think they fuckin' with me, must be sick in the head
Why don't you chill with the beef and get some chicken instead?
Got the crown, shut it down, have them hype up in the 6
If she dead, let her lay won't bring no life into this bitch
Lookin' this good should be a sin, you should call me cinnamon
Cardi B, bad bitch, those is fuckin' synonyms
We see who winnin' (See who winnin'), we see who got it (See who got it)
You see I'm still in the bank makin' deposits (Cash)
You see who switched up sides and who was solid (Who was solid)
You see who stuck to the code and who forgot it
Talk about it, bitch

[Chorus: Pardison Fontaine & Cardi B]
You know how to go and get a bag, don't you? (Ayy)
You know how to make a bitch mad, don't you (Ayy)
Make your ex wanna get it back, that's a fact
Say it louder for the bitches in the back (Ayy)
I know how to go and get a bag, don't I (Don't I)
I know how to get a bitch mad, don't I (Yeah)
Make my ex wanna get it back, that's a fact
Say it louder for the bitches in the back (Ayy)
Back, back-backin' it up
I'm the king of talkin' shit, then backin' it up (Ayy)
Back, back-backin' it up
Throw that shit over here, girl, that's what it's for (What you say?)
