[Intro]
Bardi!

[Hook]
Bitches be pressed
They knew how I'm coming for yo bitch in the flesh
Who the fuck she gon' check? She be talking that shit, talkin' out of her neck
Put blood on her dress, bitches be mad when they see Cardi step in the spot
Said that you 'bout it, we know that you're not
I'ma pull up on bitches as soon as I drop
Bitches be pressed
They knew how I'm coming for yo bitch in the flesh
Who the fuck she gon' check? She be talking that shit, talkin' out of her neck
Put blood on her dress, bitches be mad when they see Cardi step in the spot
Said that you 'bout it, we know that you're not
I'ma pull up on bitches as soon as I drop

[Verse 1]
Press, press, press, press, press
Cardi don't need more press
Kill 'em all, put 'em hoes to rest
Walk in bullet proof vest
Please tell me who she gon' check
Murder scene, Cardi made a mess
Pop up guess who, bitch
Pop up guess who, bitch (let it go, let it go, let it go)
