Bitch I can't face it, I sip on the Matrix, I'm dead or alive (uhh)
If I go broke I'm not asking nobody, I'm ready to rob (ready to kick)
Slob on my knob, canary diamonds, corn on the cob (yellow, ice)
Fifty K sloppy, all in my pocket, call it a Whopper (fifty ball)
Can't kick it, no soccer, birds in the trap still sing like an opera (brr)

Still ballin' like forty-four, and we still pull up with choppers
Still bustin' off forty-four, you talkin' 'bout guns or the profit (uh)

You got them bricks, we gon' hit the door (boo)
