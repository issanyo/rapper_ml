[Verse 1: Cardi B]
I gave you more than I give myself
So loyal to you that I betray myself
Well I guess Ima wither away

You a snake and you chose to slither today
I gave my all my love and my trust but
I guess my all just wasn't enough
Yeah there's something about you I can't help it
But Ima do for myself I'm being selfish

[Verse 2: Josh X]
Babe your melody is the voice I need makes me skip a beat yeah
And baby you know it yeah
But it's hard to show it
See the one I love used to be in clubs used to fuck with thugs yeah
And I can't expose it yeah cause she already know it yeah
But why don't you ask me
Why is it so hard to fall in love
Why don't you ask me
Why can I never ever ever try
Why don't you ask me
Why everything is going this way
Why don't you ask me
I guess we don't know
They say the one that you truly love hurts you the most
Now the one that I truly love hurt me the most
Now the one that you truly love is hurting you the most
I guess I'll never know
Why I got so cold
It's not your fault

[Outro: Cardi B & Josh X]
Be selfish, be selfish, be selfish Withering away as I gaze at the sky looking at his face and all the pain it's caused me
I ask why
Didn't I love
Didn't I give you more than I ever gave myself
What do you wish cause that part of me no longer exist
This time I'm first, I'm picking me
I finally learned to be selfish
