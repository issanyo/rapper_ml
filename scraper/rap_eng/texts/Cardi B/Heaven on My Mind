Ay, now two step with me
Now hold up, two step with me

[Verse 1: Josh X]
This love is problematic
Your love makes me an addict
For you babe
(What you say? What you say? What you say?)
Oh girl, I've got to have it
Your body's more than average
Drives me cray
Girl your eyes, your smell
Your body, girl, for real
Your hair, your moves
Girl I can't get enough
Girl I can't give it up

[Hook: Josh X]
Heaven comes to my mind
Girl when I see your face
Send me on a one way flight
Girl 'cause I'm on my way

[Verse 2: Cardi B]
It's like magic when we come around
Baby we the baddest to ever touch the sound
He treat me like a queen 'cause he know I hold it down
And he always keep it real, he my king, he got the crown
I saw the time is so right
I think he got me tonight
I know we been through so much
But true love is a fact
And he ain't never have to question nothing that I do
And I don't care if you go to jail, I'm so down with you

[Bridge: Josh X]
You must be
Tired of him always cheatin' constantly
That's why I got you up here out with me
So take my hand, you don't got to front for love

'Cause I believe in us

[Bridge: Josh X]

Tired of him always cheatin' constantly
That's why I got you up here out with me
So take my hand, you don't got to front for love
