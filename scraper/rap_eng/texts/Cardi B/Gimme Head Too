[Intro]
A-Wall shit
Squat made the beat

[Hook: J.R.]
Bend over, let me see, I just want some head bitch
Skip the draws, I can't get involved, give me head bitch
I'ma pass, you can keep the ass, give me head bitch
Ain't no simp, you know I'ma a pimp, that's how I play it bitch
Bend over, let me see, I just want some head bitch
Skip the draws, I can't get involved, give me head bitch
I'ma pass, you can keep the ass, give me head bitch
Ain't no simp, you know I'ma a pimp, that's how I play it bitch

[Verse 1: J.R.]
RIP to Pimp, I just want some head bitch
Want the mouth from a St. Louis chicken head bitch
She an east side, Brooklyn ass, strippin' ass bitch
If she a hitter I'ma treat her, yeah I'm pimpin' that bitch
All this money I got bread on 'em
Got the dirty (?) got the head on her
That mouth a blessin', niggas prayin' on her
She's been on it, I ain't mad at her
She gon' do it like I'm mad at her
Crazy head, yeah I'm talkin' mad hatter
And she gon' climb, she don't need no ladder
And she can throw, she just know I want the throat
Who that?

[Hook: J.R.]

[Verse 2: Cardi B]
You want head nigga? Well I want bread nigga
Or pay my lights, gas, heat, or rent instead nigga
That's how you flex nigga? That get me wet nigga
And I ain't with that dirty shit, come correct nigga
Motherfuckers think that they can dope and blow my name
But you cannot pimp a ho who already know the game
I just skate off on them niggas when they talk a ring
Cause I'm that stupid bitch you think you could save

[Bridge: J.R.]
Don't save her
Ain't nobody save her
I'm in the 6 gettin' ate up
Do it right fore I get paid up
Or she can go, she just know I want the throat

[Hook: J.R.]

Ain't no simp, you know I'ma a pimp, that's how I play it bitch
Bend over, let me see, I just want some head bitch
Skip the draws, I can't get involved, give me head bitch
I'ma pass, you can keep the ass, give me head bitch
