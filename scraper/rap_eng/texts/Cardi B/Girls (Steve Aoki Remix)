[Verse 1: Rita Ora]
Her name is Lara, we learned a lot, ah
How to do it, like we do it like we wanna
We just know
We just know
I ain't one-sided, I'm open-minded
I'm fifty-fifty and I'm never gonna hide it
You should know, eh
You should know

[Pre-Chorus: Charli XCX]
All summer, we've been in the 'bu
'68 Chevy with nothin' to do
In the summer haze, hush lovin'
And last night, yeah, we got with the dude
I saw him, he was lookin' at you
So I said, "Hey," hush lovin'

[Chorus: Rita Ora & Charli XCX, Bebe Rexha]
Sometimes, I just wanna kiss girls, girls, girls
Red wine, I just wanna kiss girls, girls, girls
Sometimes, I just wanna kiss girls, girls, girls
Red wine, I just wanna kiss girls, girls, girls
Girls, girls, girls, girls, girls
(Yeah, you know I)

[Verse 2: Bebe Rexha & Charli XCX]
You know I tamed it, and then I named it
I put the lion in the cage and then I laid with
Her all night (all night)
Her all night, yeah
I'm the hunter and she the prey, yeah
I'm the thriller and the killer and the saviour
Up all night
We up all night, yeah (do it one more time)

[Pre-Chorus: Rita Ora, with Bebe Rexha]
All summer, we've been in the 'bu
'68 Chevy with nothin' to do
In the summer haze, hush lovin'

[Chorus: Rita Ora, Charli XCX & Bebe Rexha]
Sometimes, I just wanna kiss girls, girls, girls
Red wine, I just wanna kiss girls, girls, girls (yeah yeah, yeah yeah)
Sometimes, I just wanna kiss girls, girls, girls (you know that I do)
Red wine, I just wanna kiss girls, girls, girls
Girls, girls, girls, girls, girls
(Yeah, you know I)

[Bridge: Charli XCX, Rita Ora & (Cardi B)]
We can go up
She like it down with me, yeah-ah
She like it down with me, yeah-ah (Rita)
She like it down with me, yeah-ah (look, Cardi)
Oh, we can go up

[Verse 3: Cardi B]
Now I could be your lipstick, just for one night (one night)
Girls just wanna have fun and have their funds right (yeah)
I mean, say my name, say my name, say my name (say my name)
It tastes good just rollin' off your tongue, right? (Hurrr)
I put this MAC on your lips, so pucker up (mwah)
We ain't never heard of you 'cause you ain't done enough (no)
And I don't gotta introduce myself (Cardi)
I'm too sexy, I seduce myself (Bardi)
Seven-figure, never need a... (nope)
I steal your chick, have her down with the scissor
Tonight, I don't want a dog, I want a kitten (eeeooowww)
I might French a girl from Great Britain

[Chorus: Bebe Rexha, & Rita Ora, Charli XCX & Cardi B]
Sometimes, I just wanna kiss girls, girls, girls (oh yeah)
Red wine, I just wanna kiss girls, girls, girls
Sometimes, I just wanna kiss girls, girls, girls (oh yeah)
Red wine, I just wanna kiss girls, girls, girls (say aah)
Girls, girls, girls, girls, girls
(Yeah, you know I)
