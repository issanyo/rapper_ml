[Hook]
I pull up, like what's up, everything on fleek
I do it nice, seven days a week
Like oh my, oh my, oh my God
I don't do nothing for free you know I got to charge
When I'm done, they be like you better
You better, you better, you better
When that check come I be like
You better, you better, you better

[Verse 1]
I'm Cardi exotic, my ice retarded
I walk in the party get started
Murder scene he want all this
Your bitch I demolish on fleek is what you call it
This not a game, fuck is you saying
Bullshit is something I don't entertain
Come correct if gon' call out my name
Not talking money I'm switching these lanes, like swerve
Now watch me, now watch me, swag surf
Boy you better respect the curve
I'm on my bullshit, fuck what you heard
Oh you ain't know, well you gon' learn

[Hook]
I pull up like what's up, everything on fleek
I do it nice, seven days a week
Like oh my, oh my, oh my God
I don't do nothing for free you know I got to charge
When I'm done, they be like you better
You better, you better, you better
When that check come I be like
You better, you better, you better

[Verse 2]
Fleek the definition of me
I keep it in check papi
I am a whole different breed
I'm Cardi, capiche
Them other ones can't compete
I make bitches want to retreat
I go to the desert for weeks
When I come back I come back with heat
Now they be all up in my DM
Tryna get Cardi B to PM
I swear to God I don't see 'em
I'm high up in the hills like The Weeknd

[Hook]
I pull like what's up, everything on fleek
I do it nice, seven days a week
Like oh my, oh my, oh my God
I don't do nothing for free you know I got to charge
When I'm done, they be like you better
Do better, you better, you better
When that check come I be like
You better, you better, you better
