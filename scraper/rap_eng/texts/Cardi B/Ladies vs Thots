[Verse 1]
I need a lady not a thot
Here's a reminder
Ladies wanna be black queens
Thots wanna be Blac Chyna
Ladies like a man who works hard with some drive (Ambition)
Thots like “Fuck that! What kind of car does he drive?”
Ladies cook for you
Throw down and be cheffin'
Thots ready to fight, they throw down in a second
Ladies they be faithful
Thots they a cheater
Ladies “Hi Mrs. Parker”, Thots “bye Felicia”
Ladies gotta work so they sleep before 12
Thots in the club cause it's free before 12
Ladies cancel dates for their kids, like fam nah
Thots like "C'mon baby you're going with grandma"
A lady got a brother, that’s a sibling and we know (I know it bro)
A thot says that's a brother that niggas hittin' it on the low
Thots gettin' high but can't get hired
Thots want power couples
Ladies, empires

[Hook]
I ain't got time for these hoes
They ain't really worth nothin', (Oh)
I ain't got time for these hoes
I ain't got time for these thots
Theres a difference between
Having a lady and a thot, yeah

[Verse 2]
A lady wants a man that's in school with his MBA
A thot wants a nigga in the NBA
Thots sit home watch reality shows
Ladies still in tune with reality though
Ladies get a salary, you know, wage a hour
Ladies want weddings, thots want baby showers
Thots do freak shit, throw it on the ground
Ladies is freaks too, but only for their man
She's a slut, she's a ho, she's a freak
Ain't got a job but everything on fleek
Thinkin' that I'm disrespect ladies, nigga stop!
I just know the difference between the ladies and the thots
(Cashflow)

[Hook]
I ain't got time for these hoes
They ain't really worth nothin', (Oh)
I ain't got time for these hoes
I ain't got time for these thots
There's a difference between
Having a lady and a thot
