[Chorus:]
I don't really trust them no more
All these bitches do is talk behind your back that's a no go
And I don't really stress it no more
Getting all this money made my heart so cold
Middle finger up to you hoes
Hating on me I'm making moves on the road though
And I don't really trust them no more
I don't really stress it no more
I don't be trusting them
I don't be stressing them
I swear I just flex on them
I swear I just flex on them

[Verse 1:]
Carbi B, me bad one
You bitches sad ones
I just get my money and I style on them
All them bitches broke and they mad I just dab on them
Wave bye hit the gas on them
200 on the dash on them
I don't say much I just swag on them
I be killing them, I go Fab on them
Left right throwing jabs at them
Night night Ima black on them
Hit the game raw no magnums
Can't stop winning God finna go platinum

[Chorus:]
I don't really trust them no more
All these bitches do is talk behind your back that's a no go
And I don't really stress it no more
Getting all this money made my heart so cold
Middle finger up to you hoes
Hating on me I'm making moves on the road though
And I don't really trust them no more
I don't really stress it no more
I don't be trusting them
I don't be stressing them
I swear I just flex on them
I swear I just flex on them

[Verse 2:]
NY Cardi next in line
Yeah it's my time real hittas gonna respect mine
I got deadlines
Ima hit the headlines ain't no bed time young boss nigga I ain't lying
I fuck shit up then I come for my checks
What you expect Cardi in full effect
I see they mad

But it's not my fault when I shoot it's all net
Like swish now they look at the flick of the wrist
They sending shots but I swear it's all miss

You must be drunk off all of those liqs

[Outro:]
I don't be trusting them
I don't be stressing them
I swear I just flex on them
I swear I just flex on them
NY Cardi next in line
Yeah it's my time real hittas gonna respect mine
I got deadlines
Ima hit the headlines ain't no bed time young boss nigga I ain't lying
