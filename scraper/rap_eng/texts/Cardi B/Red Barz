[Intro]
Uh, yeah
Some regular degular, bloody bars

[Verse]
I swear to God, they ain't wanna see me leave the club
Got up on my shit and now they scared to show me love
They'd rather see me on the pole twerkin' it for dubs
I guess I really gotta show them what the fuck is up
I'm on some other shit, that Cardi B gutta shit
Every time I catch a hating bitch, she on her stutter shit
Can't finish her words but on Instagram thuggin' shit
You set yourself up, don't make it seem like I be buggin', bitch
And niggas hatin' on me, really be upset
I don't know, make me wonder what you got between your legs
You a real nigga mad at a bitch for getting bread?
You's a bitch from birth, you just grew a third leg, woo!
Bite down, bite down, it was crunch time
Yeah I skip all of them bitches in the lunch line
I put in work, now I'm here at the front line
Ready for the bullshit, I swear it's on my bloodline
Touch mine, getting slumped, slimed one time
Pump blind, bitches quick, then I dump mine
Pull up with the Gucci clutch, spitting clutch rhymes
Flyer than a big big B with a Blood tie
Don't do much, he get hard when I bust wines
No straws for this juice box, got one time
Last nigga I was with went insane
'Cause my head game over hills like I'm lookin' for the sunshine
I'm a Bronx bitch birthed from the hip-hop
From the block to the tick tock in the Patek watch
Quick drop with the cash, couldn't fit the Ziploc
Grips locked, get your shit popped in my flip flops
Wealthy now, but every dollar, I still want it all
Now he wanna nail me, I could give your man a cure
You gotta mail me, but I don't check my spam at all
Never feel what you're sayin' like I'm usin' Anbesol
Travel all around the states getting nice checks
I was tourin' off a tape, I had a hype set
Is that the reason all these niggas wanna pipe next?
I'm a creep, bitch, see his dick through his Nike Tech
Got 'em all scared, I ain't even strike yet
Wire up jaws when I swing if the mic stretch
I worked hard, took the right steps, had a shot
So I took the shit, now this game gon' need a life vest

[Outro]
Uh
I said, woo!
Huh
