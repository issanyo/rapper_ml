[Full lyrics available upon release of the song]

[Hook]
Stylin' on these hoes, I'm stylin' on these hoes
I be stylin' on these hoes, I'm stylin' on these hoes
[?] wrist full of gold
I be stylin' on these niggas, stylin' on these hoes
Grind up a check, got it at the store
Runnin' through the checks till the club close
Stylin' on these niggas, stylin' on these hoes
I be stylin' on these bitches, stylin' on these hoes

[Verse 1]
I gotta get it, I need the chicken, I need the bread
That's why I'm workin' and I'm in the Benz 'cause you in the bed
Bitches is sleepin', fuck is they thinkin'? What is you doin'?
Then they be mad, lookin' at me like I did something to 'em, uh
Bank account on racks, pussy still on drip drop
Put this pussy on wax, took me straight to the tip top
I might race with the Wraith, ain't no space in the safe
Next bitch in my face catchin' case, catchin' case
But anywho, anywho, Birkin bag, Jimmy Choos
All my bitches say "Eeeeooowwww!", all my guns go "Boom!"
More guns than the warden, smack hoes with my Jordans
Pussy's floodin' New Orleans, kiss a bitch and I'm gorgeous
Never been no pussy, yo, I'm always with the shits
I ain't never been no dirty broad but now I'm filthy rich, bitch bitch!

[Hook]
Stylin' on these hoes, I'm stylin' on these hoes
I be stylin' on these hoes, I'm stylin' on these hoes
[?] wrist full of gold
I be stylin' on these niggas, stylin' on these hoes
Grind up a check, got it at the store
Runnin' through the checks till the club close
Stylin' on these niggas, stylin' on these hoes
I be stylin' on these bitches, stylin' on these hoes

[Verse 2]
Money, money, money, money's all I think of
I swear to God, I wake up and get the green stuff
You put your money on these hoes, get your refund
I just got my nails did, I just got my weave done
If you want a fly press put Bardi on that shit
I just bought a new gun, put a body on that shit
She upstairs, I'ma wait in the lobby for that bitch
I got my bitch and a man that can buy me all that shit
You can find my fine ass
Bathtub with a wine glass
All these hoes wanna bring me down
I don't never ever mind that
Can you show me where your money is?
'Cause I know where mine's at
All the energy you put in me
You just tryna get the top back
Lately I been on some conceited shit
'Cause I don't need a bitch
Blast off, I don't feed a bitch
That's how I treat a bitch
In my hood I got hella stripes
Straight Adidas shit
Hope she got the same energy
When I see that bitch, bitch!

[Hook]
Stylin' on these hoes, I'm stylin' on these hoes
I be stylin' on these hoes, I'm stylin' on these hoes
[?] wrist full of gold
I be stylin' on these niggas, stylin' on these hoes
Grind up a check, got it at the store
Runnin' through the checks till the club close
Stylin' on these niggas, stylin' on these hoes
I be stylin' on these bitches, stylin' on these hoes
