[Verse 2]
Rooftop party 30 floors in the air
Dope everywhere so them hoes gon' be there
And them hoes comin' out they clothes any minute
Gone off that molly, ain't nothin' off limits
God damn Keisha got a big ol' ass
Shawty so nasty had to buy her a bag
Had to reward that pussy
She was beggin' me to record that pussy (with lights, camera, action)
She do it so good i can tell she had practice
Move to Hollywood, said she wanna be a actress
Straight to an event it's like 5 in a morn'
Blowin' loud in a cone, Emmitt Smith I'm in my zone
And i left my chick at home, 'cause them hoes gon' be there
