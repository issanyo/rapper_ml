[Intro: DRAM]
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey, hey
G-g-g-good Work Charlie

[Verse 1: DRAM]
Know that shit just happened but by her reaction
You would think I been the man, you make it look easy
Even though it's cliche, I saw you on your Instagram and

[Chorus: DRAM]
I think you're cute, I think you're cute
Oh, yes I do, I think you're cute
I think you're cute, I think you're cute
Oh, yes I do, I think you're cute

[Verse 2: Cardi B]
Oh, you think I'm cute, but I think you ugly
Trust me, it's cool, I use you for money
Flowers for me, don't do nothing for me
Right to Dubai, in a yacht, you could blow me
Dinner at Philippe, but I really want a Philippe
Gonna have to step your game up
I'm the hottest bitch in the streets
I'm the hottest bitch in the game
Know I'm the wettest bitch in the sheets
All them little bitches you fuck
Yeah, they're cute, but they are not me
Me, me, me, me, I'm a beast
Me, I'm a dog, I don't come on no leash
This bitch is ballin', just look at my piece
Whippin' the foreign, I'm bending these streets
Woo! Woo! Look at my piece
This bitch is ballin', just look at my piece
Whippin' the foreigns, I'm bending these streets
Send out a hit and they tell me, "Capiche"

[Chorus: DRAM]
I think you're cute, I think you're cute
Oh, yes I do, I think you're cute
I think you're cute, I think you're cute
Oh, yes I do, I think you're cute

[Verse 3: DRAM]
I just had to park my car 'cause I was finna crash the whip
Scrolling through my feed I saw you just had post a pic
I choose you like a Pokémon
I choose you, you're selection one
I got money, you got money too
So let's go half on rent
When I buy you a new purse it's 'cause you bought my kicks
I move fast like a brand new car
I move fast like a shooting star
If I say we married then goddamn we gettin' married
If you need it and I got it you can have it, bitch, I'm sharing
If you cryin' I'ma ask you why you crying, bitch I'm caring
If you need me to look out for you I'm posted and I'm staring
Thou should never have another boyfriend, I get jealous
Yeah, I’m all 'bout spreadin' love, but I get crazy as a felon
I choose you, now you have to deal
But you're so cute, you can make me chill

[Chorus: DRAM]
I think you're cute, I think you're cute
Oh, yes I do, I think you're cute
I think you're cute, I think you're cute
Oh, yes I do, I think you're cute

[Outro: DRAM]
Girl, we need to go out on a date
We can really do a little something
If it's cool, I'll pick you up at 8
We can really do a little something
We can really do a little something, lil' baby
Looking at this pretty face, it drives me crazy
