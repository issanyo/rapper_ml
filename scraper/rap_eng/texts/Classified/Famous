[Intro: Sway Clarke]
And it's the ones that always leave me
Are the never that never see me
And I'm all alone so far from home
And I'm the one to be with
But you love me cause I'm famous
Now you're all alone, and I'm far from home
Don't want to be famous, I don't want to be
I don't want to be famous, I don't want to be famous
Don't want to be famous, I don't want to be
I don't want be famous, I don't want to be famous

[Verse 1: Robbie G]
I don't need the fame, the illusion of a buzz
I just want to make a living off of doing what I love
I want to take what I was given, make a change and stay driven
I don't need first place, don't need to leave the race winning no
We put so much pressure on ourselves
We expect to be the best and better than everyone else
But the feeling that we're left with is that we're incomplete
Unless we're the best at what we do
Not all of us can compete though
I try and stay inspired, working so much everyday I'm tired
And I don't even care if I have my face admired
I just want to make enough to keep the people close to me fed
And keep a roof over my head
I know the road is slow but instead of making a quick buck
I practice patience and persistence no way that I'll give up
Have faith in what I'm doing so I know that I'll make it
What it means to me to make it, I don't need to be famous, c'mon

[Chorus: Sway Clarke]
And it's the ones that always leave me
Are the never that never see me
And I'm all alone so far from home
Don't want to be famous, I don't want to be
I don't want to be famous, I don't want to be famous
Don't want to be famous, I don't want to be
I don't want be famous, I don't want to be famous

[Verse 2: Robbie G]
I don't need the fame no need to burst on the scene
I want the organic growth, slow but sure to succeed
I don't need a packed arena, not a person with greed
If I can rock a couple hundred people, that's perfect for me
We have high expectations, which leads to disappointment
Life gets aggravating but we need to just enjoy it
I don't need a lot, but I hope that this is getting me paid
I just want to make sure that I'm smiling at the end of the day
And happy with myself, don't need a mansion and the wealth
If someone needs something, well then I plan on helping out
I don't need the flashing lights, I just need a pad and mic
And about an hour and a half to write, class, half-life
My loved ones I promised them that they wouldn't get hurt
I never get time to see them, I'm always putting in work
Hard work pays off I don't need to be famous though
I'll make it even if my record don't make it on radio

[Chorus]
