Ain't no rest for the wicked
Ain't no rest for the wicked
Ain't no thing
Ain't no rest for the wicked

Gimme that classic bass line

Okay, let the children run around
Cause I'm about to play until the sun is down
How can I be classified
I ain't commercial or underground
6'4" and 200 pounds
I'm waitin' on the money round
My BB gun is loaded
I'm so holy, right? I'll hunt you down
I skip no detail
To afford a gentleman and females
Well, you show no emotion like emails
I ain't no thrift shop rapper, nothing go on resale
My raps stay on track, never derail, I prevail
The world's a mess and I fit in perfect, uh
The wicked never rest, work until there's work in, uh
We used to live for the moment
Now we tape it on our camera phones
And take it home and show our friends what they're missing
I don't get it
We're living in the new era
I'm back wearing these snap backs
Cause some reason my fitted hats
Are out of shape and fitting wack
I call it how I see it
State the obvious like Twitter facts
I'm filling a position
Yeah, the designated hitter's back

Ain't no rest for the wicked (Yeah, we tell em')
Ain't no rest for the wicked (But I ain't worry cause it)
Ain't no thing
Yeah, you lit the fire inside us now, ain't no time to be righteous, we tell em'
Ain't no rest for the wicked (Yeah, we tell em')
Ain't no rest for the wicked (But I ain't worry cause it)
Ain't no thing (They say)
Ain't no rest for the wicked

Ayo, I'm thinking out the box and stepping out of my perimeter
I overbook myself, but not on purpose like Air Canada
I'm coming from the land of the
Lost, so I'm cautious
I got no time to waste money, so I don't buy no watches
Life can be so hard
But it gets harder when you stupid
At least that's what I think
So let me know when you go through it
I'm a funny guy, ha ha ha
And I like my eggs sunny side, up up up
But I gotta scramble with these vocals and samples before I'm trampled
To have a future in this industry is such a gamble
My battery is charged
But my cellphone signal is scattered
I'm tryna' get reception out of Rogers like the Packers
But all I hear is static
I'm a trendsetter on a vendetta with my band members
We cooler than ice packs, more flavour than spice racks
I ain't no instigator, but believe I will fight back
Be wicked with this

Ain't no rest for the wicked (Yeah, we tell em')
Ain't no rest for the wicked (But I ain't worry cause it)
Ain't no thing
Yeah, you lit the fire inside us, now ain't no time to be righteous, we tell em'
Ain't no rest for the wicked (Yeah we tell em')
Ain't no rest for the wicked (But I ain't worry cause it)
Ain't no thing (They say)
Ain't no rest for the wicked
