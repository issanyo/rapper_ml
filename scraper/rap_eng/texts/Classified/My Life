[Verse One:]
Yo I'll be the last man standing
My hands cramped, can't see
My family can't stand me cause I grew to be an MC
My girl's sick and tired of not getting attention
Really she thinks I'm fucked doesn't wanna be mentioned
My competition is why I do this
And all my clothes are too big
One exception, my shoes fit
I got my priorities straight but can't figure them out
So i'ma even them out in to equal amounts, yo
It's only seldom my career
Forget the past class still an action skill
Reachin maximum, my overdrives extensive
Runnin off of stress
Sick of gettin bills should've gave a false address
My pulse can't rest I'm all a mess
My life is a twist, writin' this shit, enlighten you clique
Recitin' the script, to keep my metal intact
Gettin' mad writin' lyrics and my pencil will snap
The formatted flow that functions ferocious
Got animated attitude to attempt to approach this
Let your flow spit my departures hopeless
And now you know this, no excuse when I flow shit

[Hook] {x2}
This is my li-i-i-i-ife
And I'm doin' what I want (like)
Drinkin alcohol 'til I'm drunk (right)
And you ain't go no say in my life
So mind your own business

[Verse Two]
Yo my whole anatomy got a world of people mad at me
Climbin' rapidly, got people chasin after me
My faculty is actually sitting near the back of me
Ground Squad pound hard think about it, it has to be
And actively we put in work, rap for free
Makin' moves and the money, that's strategy
Practically you only half of me, I'm last to bleed
And keep it tight like a family, yo but anyway
I'm gonna take this to another level
Try to compare and I'll distort your shit like heavy metal
My mind is temperamental, makin these instrumentals
Still essential, but so much potential
Innovate, no stencil, drawn with pencil
Keep eventful, lettin loose, fuck confidential
This is me and i'ma let it all out with the mic in my hand
Make you jump on command, ah damn
Only so much I can take before I break out this weapon
And start lyrically infectin'
Then put down my foot on kids who impose
Leave you stone cold frozen, now who's open?

[Hoook]
