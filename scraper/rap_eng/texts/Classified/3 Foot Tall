[Hook]
When you're alone life can be a little rough
It makes you feel like you're 3 foot tall
When it's just you, well times can be tough
When there's no one there to catch your fall
3 foot tall, like you're 3 foot tall
3 foot tall, when there's no one there to catch your fall

[Verse 1: Classified]
I am from the crossroad, off road, dodging all the of pot holes
On my auto-mobile, hollerin' out watch-out
We lost hope like Bob Hope so what are we suppose to follow?
I'm a leader not an apostle, but I believe in the freedom that God holds
I'm on the top rope, ready to jump so watch close
Been criticized and boxed out since I was a snot nose kid
We ain't living for tomorrow we living for the lord
Though everybody trying to fit in the crowd, like Where's Waldo?
I freeze time like photographs living for the moment
I'm taking mental pictures reminiscing where I'm smoking
When I see the light of day, right away I write away
Cause things I write and say give me direction like Michael Bay
I need some in my life, because my plans ain't never work out
Like when I make plans to work out, because everything don't always turn out
How you want them too, honest truth, nah ain't nothing wrong with Luke
I'll walk this path alone, but I need somebody here to talk me through
But who?

[Hook]
When you're alone life can be a little rough
It makes you feel like you're 3 foot tall
When it's just you, well times can be tough
When there's no one there to catch your fall
When you're alone life can be a little rough
It makes you feel like you're 3 foot tall
When it's just you, well times can be tough
When there's no one there to catch your fall
3 foot tall, like you're 3 foot tall
3 foot tall, when there's no one there to catch your fall

[Verse 2: Classified]
I know we have our unity, community with everyone I did music with
But over the years they disappeared, not ain't too many still doing this
Feeling like I've gone through war lost my soldiers on the journey
Feeling like we built the team but only I with the jersey
Yeah, everything comes and goes I've dealt with the undertow
Keeping my head above the water, pushed on, now I run the show
I know the situations never perfect deal with what you got
Never bite your tongue, say your piece don't let them shut you up
They say everything's about money, nah only business
If your friends think that, then you hang with money hungry pigeons
The world is hollow, y'all need to eat I'm making a pot roast
These people are all for themselves
So I ain't in for feeding no cockroach
Wrong or right I know the type don't be a gimmick
Cause everything comes full circle, jerk get it
I ain't looking for the exit I'm trying to show you where my head is
When you feel alone play my songs and that keeps us connected

[Hook]
When you're alone life can be a little rough
It makes you feel like you're 3 foot tall
When it's just you, well times can be tough
When there's no one there to catch your fall
When you're alone life can be a little rough
It makes you feel like you're 3 foot tall
When it's just you, well times can be tough
When there's no one there to catch your fall
3 foot tall, like you're 3 foot tall
3 foot tall, when there's no one there to catch your fall
