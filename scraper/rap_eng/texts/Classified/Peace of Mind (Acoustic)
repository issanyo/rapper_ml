[Verse 1: David Myles]
(humming)
Here tomorrow, gone today
What I had slipped away
Gonna be the last time you hear me say
Here tomorrow, gone today

Cause i'll find peace of mind
The day that I stop tryin'
Oh i'll find peace of mind
The day that i stop tryin'

[Chorus: David Myles]
Cause i've been losing my way
Been listening too much to what other people say
And if I can't hear the notes that I play
I've got nothing

[Verse 2: Classified]
But I need something though
Cause life is cold, tryin' to trek through the slush and snow
With nothin' too hold except my soul, everything comes and goes
I finally feel a peace, relieved, can breathe a sigh of relief
I wanted approval, but it's only me that knows what im trying to acheive
I've lightened the load, I've loostened my straps, and emptied my backpack
The weight is too much, I do what i have to get back on track
I was side tracked from the right path, Its part of the growing process
Tryin' to beat and compete with the competition, It's really a no win contest
This is life y'all

[David Myles]
And there's nothing you can do but ride it out

[Classified]
That's why I write this out
With every high, comes a low
With every mistake, comes a growth
With every chord, you gotta take notes
Dont lose your way, just follow the road, and go (oh)

[David Myles & Classified]
The wheels are turning, keep it moving, grind it out

[Classified]
Yeah, that's what it's about
The things that you think would matter after the glass is broken and shattered
It dont mean nothin'
But still we make assumptions, that's just how we function

[Chorus: David Myles]
Cause i've been losing my way
Been listening too much to what other people say
And if I can't hear the notes that I play
I've got nothing
