(Shawn Phillips - verse1)

Im 22 feeling like i grew old too quick
I got the mind of a man with a dying wish
Im blind when it comes to finding a friend that i can trust
So i turn to rap, no turning back only speeding up
Im in a race with my future, my destiny's ahead of me
I cannot find my centre balance holding on desperately
I measured up to everything they all said ide never be
And now im so close i can feel it in my bones
Beat you to the throne
Ima beat it till my bare knuckles break and shatter barriers exceeding what we know
Ima fiend on the microphone, the nicest guy you know
Take the fire from these other rappers sink it in my flow
Feeling so at home,feet up on the table
Knowing every day ill wake up happy with the life i chose
Even though, at the moment i been feeling cold
I know things are going to heat up when i start dropping these poems

(Chorusx2)

Its like im in a movie where the bad guy wins
And every time i rewind and start over again
I expect to see something different in the end
But here we go let the story begin

(Kurt Hustle - verse2)

Bring it back to 2009
Before i was a rapper just before i lost my mind
My idol dies car crash on cheapside
Left me on this earth to carry on what he strived
For his whole life i mean i followed in his past
Im tryin my best to make this thing last
God dam i feel the pressure building
God willin me strength to press on for my future children
I feel like i grew up too quick
Hangin wit the crew drinkin n smokin cigs
I was never into boy scouts and bake sales
I mean i did make sales but they were never retail
I always try to make the best situation
And lately its been more revelations in my basement
So either way i gotta get this doh
Either im out here hustlin or tourin on the road so..

(Chorusx2)

Its like im in a movie where the bad guy wins
And every time i rewind and start over again
I expect to see something different in the end
But here we go let the story begin
