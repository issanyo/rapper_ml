I Love You
So I sit and write sometimes (I sit and write sometimes)
I'm very clear my love
To say what's in my heart
But all those lines all fall apart
It's such an old cliche but paints a perfect picture
I know I'm busy a lot I'm really tryin' to work this with ya
And I ain't the sappy type but listen' I'ma set it straight
I know I'm missin' Birthdays and other important dates
But this music's got my hands tied and it keeps gettin' tighter
I know it'll pay off, the dark days'll seem better
And it really ain't that bad but I see where ya comin' from
I'm gone by the weeks you gotta stay home to make ends meat
You wakeup at 6, I sleep in to 10 o'clock
You work a 9 to 5 and I stay home without a job
And I can see why that pisses you off and pushes your buttons
But you can't forget girl I ain't doin' this for nothin'
Sometimes I'd rather go out, than make beats or write rhymes
But I gotta take advantage and take a chance in this lifetime
I hope you understand that, I know you waitin' patiently
But gimme a little time, I'll make this worth your while I guarunteed
So listen for a minute
I Love You
So I sit and write sometimes (I sit and write sometimes)
I'm very clear my love
To say what's in my heart
But all those lines all fall apart
Now step in my shoes and see this from my view
Got 10 years of payin' dues
If I succeed so do you
If I'm rich than so are you
And I know that ain't important
And I know that you support me and everything I'm recording
But we all need assurance, ain't no shame in admittin' it
Soon you'll have a ring sliding down over your fingertip
I know your waitin', and I ain't the most romantic
But I know what I have and I ain't taking that for granted
Patience is a virtue that I know most of us lack
5 years together, that's longer than most marriges last
So please bear with me cause through thick and thin
I'm trying to build a foundation, I just hope your listenin'
And I respect you, that's why I never f*ck whores on tour
Treat you like I should, but I know sometimes you get ignored
And I spend too much time haning with Mary Jane
Worrying about this hip hop shits a scary game
And rappers are a dime a dozen, you get used up
Fans fade away, turn on you, and tell ya "You suck"
But I know you'll be here still wit' me when it's through
So don't ever think I'll put this music shit ahead of you
And that's what's real
I Love You
So I sit and write sometimes
I'm very clear my love
To say what's in my heart
But all those lines all fall apart
