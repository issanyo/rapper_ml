[Intro]
Son?
Son, sit down
What?

[Chorus]
When you're lying in bed with nothing but your thoughts, love
(Thoughts love, thoughts love)
When you're lying in bed with nothing but your fears, love
Yeah (Fears, love)
I won't be here, love

[Verse 1]
When his Mom got cancer, he asked the doctor
"Can you fix her?"
He answered, "I don't think that I can, sir"
No way, Mom's never sick, Mom never smoked
Mom is the healthy one
All you doctors and nurses, y'all can't tell me nothing
(I don't know)
She passed a month after the chemo started
His friends and family shed their tears for their dearly departed
Losing his mother, man, that never crossed his mind
Figured they still had lots of time
Just like the mind's a flawed design, he thought
He asked his dad, "Why can't they cure disease?"
He said, "Son, maybe when they find a cure for greed."
He's having flashbacks to the birthday cakes she made him
How she looked so proud and celebrated after he graduated
When she told him, "Don't you marry that lying girl I know you're dating"
And when he did, and they separated
She helped him with his kids and raised them
Appreciate it, wish she was here when he said it
Never knew how hard that death is, but gotta learn to accept it

[Chorus]
When you're lying in bed with nothing but your thoughts, love
Does it really bug you, love
Do you really want me, love
When you're lying in bed with nothing but your fears, love
Don't shed the tears, love
I won't be here, love

[Bridge]
I, I been looking for you, looking for the lies
I, okay
Let me know, let me know
Let me know, let me know

[Verse 2]
He was searching for some work, referred to the reserves
Took it further, got deployed to serve his country undeterred
His wife worried, crying, when she hugged him and said goodbye
Told his kids he had to leave, but they never understood why, no
No
Active duty overseas, saw some things he'd rather not remember
Friends body parts dismembered
Bombs dropped, dead children, war crimes and war cries
Sent home when he almost died from a car bomb and a suicide
Family's just happy he's still alive, but Daddy ain't the same
Can't adjust back to his normal life
'Cause right now it don't seem important compared to the war and
Little things like paying bills being a father, he ignored 'em
He asked the doctor help him, Xanax for depression
That just numbed him temporarily, more reclusive, less aggressive
Got addicted, doctor knew it and he cut off his prescription
Couldn't take it, started stealing, hit the streets to get his fixing
His wife couldn't forgive him, she tried, but had to kick him out
Now he panhandles on Yonge Street with a in front of Subway
With a sign that says, "Can't you spare change for a veteran?"
His wife would change it in a second, but she can't
And she accepts it

[Chorus]
When you're lying in bed with nothing but your thoughts, love
Does it really bug you, love
Do you really want me, love
When you're lying in bed with nothing but your fears, love
Don't shed the tears, love
I won't be here, love

[Bridge]
I, I been looking for you, looking for the lies
I, okay
Let me know, let me know
Let me know, let me know

[Outro]
Ooh, let me know
Ooh, ooh
Let me know, let me know
Let me know, let me know
He was shocked and in denial
Pain and the guilt
Anger and the bugging
And reflecting on himself
Depression was setting in
He's finally accepting it
Just trying to make it through the stages of grief
