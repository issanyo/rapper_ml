We both know
The time has come
Neither of us wants be the one
To say out loud
What we both know
Neither of us wants to be the one to go

Don't leave it up
Don't leave it up
Don't leave it up to me
I can’t be the one to set you free
Don't leave it up to me

Although we both see
How far we've fallen
Neither of us wants to be the one to call it
Quits
Call it quits
Neither of us wants to have it end like this

Don't leave it up
Don't leave it up
Don't leave it up to me
I have loved you too much
To set you free
Don't leave it up to me
Don’t leave it up to me

Cause I'd rather be the one with a broken heart
I'd rather be the one who falls apart
Than to be the one who makes you cry
Than to be the one who says goodbye

(Classified verse)
Girl, damn, maybe we were just too comfortable
Cause everything was wonderful
Now it’s gettin’ struck down like a thunder bolt
Or maybe we were just too gullible
At the first everything was colorful
Now it’s black and white, see it plain sight
This ain’t working out, I should up and go
I don’t wanna be the one to do it though
There’s been enough pain, enough tears
The future looks a little unclear
Been a long month and a rough year
No, I never said that love’s fair
But I think we know it, this relationship is broken
But really I ain’t good at showing my emotion, so
I’m hoping you’ll find the perfect moment to tell me
It’s over and you’re going
Because I can’t

Don't leave it up
Don't leave it up
Don't leave it up to me
Don't leave it up
Don't leave it up
Don't leave it up to me
I can’t be the one
To set you free
Don't leave it up to me
Don’t leave it up to me
