Life's not what you take, it's not about the promises you make
It's not about the friends you might have made, or love that is gone
Life is what you give, it's not about the stupid things you did
It's not about the way things could have been, it's about movin on

[Hook]
It's all about you
So every morning when you wake, before the first step that you take
Just think it's all what you make it, and you'll make it through

Yea, this life will leave you stressed out, left out, wit your neck out
Ain't nothin changed, real life, so we deal right
But it feels like it's somethin strange, we wonderin
The dumbest things and let everything get under our skin
Trouble again, tryin to impress, somebody else whose fucked in the head
So do you, you'll never make everyone happy, it just won't happen (nope)
At the end of the day, when all say is said you better be ready to go back at em'
I learn slow, my verse shows, my growth, my wisdom
If you positive, or you negative, it dont make a difference, not when you live it
Cause some of the most successful people on this planet
Will kill themselves or somebody else, life they really couldn't manage
Then we got bums, alcoholics on the streets
With no stress, nowhere to rest, nowhere to dress, nowhere to sleep
And they say, 'fuck my morals, I'm drinkin away my sorrow
I'm livin life, and I'm happy, I ain't thinkin about tomorrow'

[Hook]
It's all about you
So every morning when you wake, before the first step that you take
Just think it's all what you make it, and youll make it through {*2X*}

Life is what it brings, it's not about cars and fancy things
Or hair salons or diamond rings, cause so dont lose no sleep
Life is all about, the things you'll never figure out
It's all about the people you allow, and memories you keep

This here is life, so tell me who chooses whats wrong and right
Is it what we see, on tv, get a job, raise a family
Thats how I was raised, how I was brought up
Get a wife, a son and a daughter
Thats how I was taught to be proper
Never thought anyone could get caught up
And slowly I grew up, and the fairytale quickly vanished
Realize that life is a bitch, and shit you got to be able to stand it
And you got to be able to handle it, the stress and the pressure you channel it
And you learn to cope, at the end of your rope
Anyway that you can, wit liquor or dope
Or work hard, raise your kids, strip clubs, whatever it is
Smoke weed, shoot hoops, whatever you find your happiness through
It's your life, just make sure you know what you want when you go to get it
Keep doin this shit for you, not your crew, or the dude you tryin to impress, kid
Life is simple, life is hard, and ya life is fun
So enjoy the things around you before your life is done

[Hook]
It's all about you
So every morning when you wake, before the first step that you take
Just think it's all what you make it, and youll make it through {*2X*}
