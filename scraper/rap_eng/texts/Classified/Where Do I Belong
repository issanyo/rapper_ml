For forty days and forty nights I was alone
It was amazing, never been so far from home
I didn't know the roads
I didn't need to know that this time
I was heading for the coast
With only one thing on my mind

Where do I belong
Where do I belong
Where do I belong
Where do I belong
If not right here
If not right here...

I was young, I was restless but I wasn’t naive
I was just like the rest, I was just doing my best to be free
My hand was dancing out the window of the car
There couldn’t be a place that would be too far

Where do I belong
Where do I belong
Where do I belong
Where do I belong
If not right here
If not right here...

Tell me, tell me, tell me…
Where do I belong..

Well I woke one morning, without morning I had changed my mind
Started thinking, started missing all the things I left behind
I pulled to the side of the road and I turned around
I started heading back to my hometown
I started heading back to my hometown...

Where do I belong
Where do I belong
Where do I belong
Where do I belong
If not right here
If not right here…
