[Intro]
"What's the one big difference you notice this about this team compared to last years?"
Um, I think that we’ve always been deep
But I think this year our depth is, uh, you know it's pretty apparent
And we're getting a lot of contributions from everyone so
It’s a big part of winning, so we gotta keep doing that

[Chorus - JRDN]
We're not loud enough
'Bout to blow up
We're not loud enough
Yup, come on
I'm not a super nova I'm a super Nova Scotian

[Verse 1 - Pat Stay]
Casa Nova Scotia
P-A to the mother fuckin' T Stay
God damnit, I'll roast ya
I smoke ya, get to flippin’ like an older Motorola phone
I’ll blow your fuckin' dome up, bitch
Say something, what?
Man, check it
I put us on the map, ’cause I'm a legend
Get it?
Huh, East coast shit
Class, no I got no filters
Should've stuck me on the end of this joint like a roach clip
Uh, you could tell that the slang 'Scotian
In Newfoundland they call you bi like Frank Ocean
Beethoven I wrote deep with my fuckin’ dog
Scratching at my balls with my mother fuckin' paws

[Verse 2 - Classified]
Yeah
Gotta have it, I been at this like an addict on dope
Can't imagine what would happen if I hadn't have blown
I'm a super Nova Scotian, producer and a poet
Computer and a notepad, using what I don't have
Uh, don't be jealous now, you sounding pathetic
Like disrespecting a veteran on November 11th
We ain't having it, savages, up to our shenanigans
Taking out the target, ain't no collateral damages
If you don't like me then you never will
Sleeping through the spa like it's Benadryl
Super heroes, a super group of weirdos
Here to do their evil doings and bring music to your ear holes

[Chorus - JRDN]
We're not loud enough
Super Nova (Super Nova Scotian)
Super Nova ('Bout to blow up)
We're not loud enough
Super Nova (Super Nova Scotian)
Super Nova ('Bout to blow up)
(I'm not a super nova I'm a super Nova Scotian)

[Verse 3 - JRDN]
Moonlight hits, darkness floods the streets
Enemies rise up from underneath
Yeah, it's gonna be a long night here homie
Before the sun set, you might disappear homie
Hit you hard like a wrecking ball
No don't, hit you hard like Fentanyl
Oh, blue and white when the lights keep flashing
Hear the sound when the sirens blasting

[Verse 4 - Quake Matthews ft. Classified]
Not a super nova I'm a super Nova Scotian
Shameless, the way I'm so frank with this self-promotion
Coasting, down a script like I'm motor-boating
Flowing, wavy like the hair on Michael Bolton
Poking, from out the surface like a dolphin fin
Finishing any competition that's opposing him
You think you got what it takes to make it, Quake?
Does the smoke blow South on a fuckin' northbound locomotive
And would I bang Meghan Trainor 'til the sofa is broken?
Shit, I'm all about that bass like booty colons
Ah, tall ships, I'm just show boating
Big L flipping over the bars, like I'm Paul Rogen

[Verse 5 - Knucklehead ft. Classified]
Listen, I do what I do right on the spot
You want a verse, I do what I do right on the spot
This right off the top, you see the lean in the walk
I been putting in work, I been around like the block
Serving it hot, get it right out the pot
And you can get it if you hungry if you've eaten or not
This food for thought, get your spoon and your fork
If you eating, you the super Nova Scotian, of course
East coast, home where we hustle for sport
Where we, taken away 'cause we ain't takin' a loss
I know you hustle, but yo Knuckle, do you gut it like that?
I mean, shit, do dogs still fuck from the back?

[Chorus - JRDN]
We're not loud enough
Super Nova (Super Nova Scotian)
Super Nova ('Bout to blow up)
We're not loud enough
Super Nova (Super Nova Scotian)
Super Nova ('Bout to blow up)
(I'm not a super nova I'm a super Nova Scotian)

[Verse 7 - Bubbles]
Aw yeah, it's Bubble here
Sunnyvale Trailer Park, hard as fuck
Uh, they gave me twelve bars
But I can't fuckin' rap so I'm just gonna talk
Don't give a fuck, uh
Quake Matthews, Classified
Knuckles, Pat Stay
Scratch Bastid and JRDN
Fuckin' holdin' it down baby
(I'm bout to blow up)
I'm a super Nova Scotian
(Bout, bout to blow up)
Super Nova Scotian
(Super Nova Scotian)
Do-do-doo
Do-do-doo
This fucker doesn't end baby
Hahahaha, rapping

[Outro]
That's how you do it, apparently
