[Intro: Kayo]
Yeah
I'd like to purpose a toast

[Verse 1: Kayo]
Uh, Dark rum, chased by bad dreams
Intoxicate my soul for these goals and mad schemes
I'm... alright, it's gon' be a hell of a night again
I'm just tryna write again about things that are right within
Man, this the life, I don't ever want this night to end
Who am i kidding? I just do this to excite my friends..
See my music's like a voice for my sins,
For my redemption, I'm like fuck it and just.. binge
Cause life's like the best nights and the worst days
Frequent fights cause you missed your wife's birthday
Lose friends but gain many acquaintances
Fake as shit, and always up in ya face with it
But I ain't even see it dog, I'm in that zone
They keep telling me, "Man, just leave that shit alone"
But nah, dread, see life's a celebration
I need that hangover, that's when the pain's over, so
Fuck sober

[Hook: Classified and (Jim Cuddy)]
I don't wanna deal with the hangover
I guess I gotta deal with the hangover
(I've got the sweetest hangover
I don't want to get over..
I don't want to get over..)

[Verse 2: Classified]
Now on the road to life, I mean life on the road
It's hard to wake up every morning and get on the go
But vamanos, get up! I love the job I chose
We party every night, maybe that's the wrong approach..
But what do I know? I just know my body's sore
My head's splitting, and my driver's at the lobby doors
My crew's waiting for me, tonight's another town
I just gotta get some rest before I shut it down
Pick it up, show time, tonight I'll take it easy
'Til I realize how many people came to see me
Don't wanna slack or perform half-ass
I rock every show like this could be the last Class... act
And it's hard to party without drinking, give me just one
But I ain't a social drinker, when I start I usually get drunk
Guess I'm going all night, continuing the trend
Then I'll wake up next morning and I'll do it all again
This hangover is setting in
