[Hook]

Now if you load your rifle right
And if you fix your bayonet so
And if you kill that man my friend
The one we call the foe

[Verse 1]

I'm about to open up your mind a little bit more this time (check it, check it)
It's like a whole different world now, when a was younger
I hung around this kid who was like my third brother
Watched out for each other, felt another's pain
And back in the day we even used to dress the same
I know things changed from the world to the game
But the strange thing is, I forget that kid's name
We grew up on the same block, come for 20 years
I forget how he looks but the past is very clear
We wrote our first rhyme together
Got drunk our first time together
Shit, I thought we'd get signed together
These are days when we still got along
Chilled in the studio and killed every songs
Hey yo, 1996, shortly after graduation
He flipped his attitude, we started having situations
Started acting weird, stealing shit from the mall
And I know it ain't that bad, but I'm the one who took the fall
(What are best friends for, right?)
Yeah, that's when I realized that this guy was a asshole inside
Lying, conniving, can't deal with that shit
Keep on getting me in trouble, I'm about ready to split

Now if you load your rifle right
And if you fix your bayonet so
And if you kill that man my friend
The one we call the foe

[Verse 2]

Yo, I let the record keep spinning
And everything is different now from the beginning
And try to hang with him, and I can't say I miss him
I'm trying to elevate, stay away from all the bullshit and keep a mental state
And as the days goes by, yo, the months turn to years
I was running in the clear but always felt that he was there
Always felt he was around, I started feeling weird
How's this kid affecting me when I ain't talked to him in years
I couldn't take it son, I had enough!
So I made my way downtown and got drunk as fuck!
20 minutes walk home, took about a hour
Tried to get sober quick by jumping in the shower
Got out, slipped, hit the toilet, then my blood started to drip from the forehead
I stumble to my feet and everything became clearer
I saw my best friend, bleeding in the mirror

[Hook 2x]

Now if you load your rifle right
And if you fix your bayonet so
And if you kill that man my friend
The one we call the foe
