[Hook: C.ZAR]
I feel like a ghost, like a phantom
Kind of feel like Danny Phantom
Pour the purple in the Fanta
Got so many hoes it's Santa
Kind of feel like Danny Phantom
I go nuts, go bananas
I feel like ghost, like a phantom
Kind of feel like Danny Phantom
I feel like a ghost, like a phantom
Kind of feel like Danny Phantom
Pour the purple in the Fanta
Got so many hoes it's Santa
Kind of feel like Danny Phantom
I go nuts, go bananas
I feel like ghost, like a phantom
Kind of feel like Danny Phantom

[Verse 1: A.K Chris]
Yeah, fuck a lecture
None of you niggas gone give me pressure, nah
See, the thing bout me I'm so clever
Riding cocaine with the light leather
Going to the top with a fast pass, aye
Beautiful latina with a fat ass, yeah
Niggas download her like a Mac pack
Girl bring it to the back like a flashback
I just need respect
Gold chains all on my neck
Pull up with the plug that's a [?]
Pull up, got the work and a check
While they looking hard got the lense
Niggas looking hard like the Feds
Niggas whip it hard in the Benz, aye
Got her in the back call me handsome
Pull off on a bitch, Danny Phantom
If you follow me you know it then
Danny Phantom, Nickelodeon
Bomb wrist with a rollie, yeah
Bunch of Obi Wan Kenobi fans
Taste the fame got them phony, yeah
I just keep it on the low though
Now you niggas acting up, huh?
I thought them niggas was your bro though

[Hook: C.ZAR]
I feel like a ghost, like a phantom
Kind of feel like Danny Phantom
Pour the purple in the Fanta
Got so many hoes it's Santa
Kind of feel like Danny Phantom
I go nuts, go bananas
I feel like ghost, like a phantom
Kind of feel like Danny Phantom
I feel like a ghost, like a phantom
Kind of feel like Danny Phantom
Pour the purple in the Fanta
Got so many hoes it's Santa
Kind of feel like Danny Phantom
I go nuts, go bananas
I feel like ghost, like a phantom
Kind of feel like Danny Phantom
