[Intro]
Ooh you're dangerous
Ooh you're dangerous

[Verse 1]
She plays the same old tune
Broken records, babe, ain't nothing new
But that's the dance we do
Ooh bad habits look good on you, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
(Ooh you're dangerous)
She's the type of drug you know you love to do
(Ooh you're dangerous)
But when you get too high she'll make a mess of you
And it's a dangerous affair
Yeah, it's a dangerous affair

[Chorus]
You're dangerous love
You're dangerous love
You're dangerous love
Ooh bad habits

[Verse 2]
She got classic tune
So nostalgic babe, singing the blues
Stuck in the same damn game
Ooh bad habits when I hear her name

[Pre-Chorus]
(Ooh you're dangerous)
She's the type of drug you know you love to do
(Ooh you're dangerous)
But when you get too high she'll make a mess of you
And it's a dangerous affair
Yeah, it's a dangerous affair

[Chorus]
You're dangerous love
You're dangerous love
You're dangerous love
Ooh bad habits

[Bridge]
It's a dangerous affair
She's bound to tear me apart
They say love is tough
Well, darling, you're ooh
You're dangerous love

[Chorus]
(You're dangerous, you're dangerous)
You're dangerous love
(You're dangerous, you're dangerous)
You're dangerous love
(You're dangerous, you're dangerous)
You're dangerous love
Ooh bad habits

[Outro]
Ooh you're dangerous, love
Ooh you're dangerous
