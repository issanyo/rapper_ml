We go...

Look at the waves
Look at the stars
I see them too
Whenever they far

Look at the past
How far we've come
No matter the time spent
Is never enough

We know, we know, we know
We're never too far from home
Wherever we go
Wherever we go
I know, I know, I know
I know I'm never alone
Wherever we go love go

Don't let yourself worry tonight
Don't let yourself worry tonight
Don't let yourself worry tonight

Look at the ways
We fought but we stayed
This is forever ever
Look at the road
We crossed now, we made it
This is forever ever

We know, we know, we know
We're never too far from home
Wherever we go
Wherever we go
I know, I know, I know
I know I'm never alone
Wherever we go love go

Don't let yourself worry tonight
Don't let yourself worry tonight
Don't let yourself worry tonight

We know, we know, we know
We're never too far from home
Wherever we go
Wherever we go
I know, I know, I know
I know I'm never alone
Wherever we go
Wherever we go

We know, we know, we know
We're never too far from home
Wherever we go
Wherever we go
I know, I know, I know
I know I'm never alone
Wherever we go love go

Look at the waves
Look at the stars
I see them too
Whenever they far
