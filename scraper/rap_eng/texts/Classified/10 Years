[Chorus]
Do you remember when the days were easier
And everybody took the time
Well I would like to say that there is still a way
To live that life and end up fine

[Verse 1]
Yeah, let's take it back when we were 10
Every day me and my friends
Running the streets and playing pretend
Ain't none of us ever thought that it would end, no
Never dealt with any stress
'Cept maybe homework and tests
Couple of kids who were starting some shit
But now that never did manifest
No, spent the whole day in the forest
Me and my boys, the four of us
Thinking that we were Chuck Norris
Playing war 'til Mom called for us
Then we'd break time, high five
'Til the cold pies when the sun set
When the night sky had us wide eyed
Still dreaming of what we ain't done yet

[Chorus]
Do you remember when the days were easier
And everybody took the time
Well I would like to say that there is still a way
To live that life and end up fine

[Bridge]
We doing it all
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh here I go, oh here I go
Oh I (let it roll and go with it all)
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh here I go, oh here I go

[Verse 2]
Yeah, yeah
Let's take it back when I was 20
Started to worry about money
So me and my buddies, we went to the city
And moved out the country, we gone
And we started to stress, tryna be a success
Some went to work and then some went to college
And some just became alcoholics
Spent every night in the club and
Drinking and smoking it up and
Lookin' for women for lovin'
Had us going 'til they closed it up then
Stayed up 'til the sun rose
With a couple girls who let us come home
Waking up in a bed that was unknown
I rolled over and try to find some clothes
And she says

[Interlude]
You don't gotta go (what?), if you don't wanna go
You could stay and I'd be fine (okay)
To be honest man, this life is crazy and (I know)
I don't wanna lose my mind (yeah)

[Bridge]
We doing it all
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh here I go, oh here I go
Oh I (let it roll and go with it all)
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh here I go, oh here I go

[Verse 3]
Yeah
And when I hit 30, big 30
Had a baby, built her a nursery
Found love and married in nary's
And yearly we celebrate our anniversary, yeah
Me and my boys I don't see as much
But still catch up now and then
Throwing host parties instead of clubs
And it's just us, couple o' our friends
And I'm good with that, yeah, I'm cool with that
Trying to look ahead instead of looking back
And I never thought that it wouldn't last
And we've grown apart like the wooded path
In the forest we played in when we were 10
And what I know now, wish I knew then
'Cause I miss them days, I miss them days
But after tomorrow I'll miss today
And I'll say

[Chorus]
Do you remember when the days were easier
And everybody took the time
Well I would like to say that there is still a way
To live that life and end up fine

[Bridge]
We doing it all
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh here I go, oh here I go
Oh I (let it roll and go with it all)
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh here I go, oh here I go

[Outro]
Oh lord, lift me up
Oh lord, lift me up
Oh, da da
