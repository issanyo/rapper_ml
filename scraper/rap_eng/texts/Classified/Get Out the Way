Turn me up a little more

[Verse 1 - Classified]
Yeah, yeah, I'm a scream at the top of my lungs (ha)
Spit shit 'til it's off with the tongue (yeah)
Get lit, ride off in the sun (what?)
So don't trip cause you crawl and I run, shit it's already done
Back with the flow, the show, the magic
Went from hat tricks to uppin my status
Yep another classic, hard to believe
Poker face on with a card up my sleeve
They all said I never looked the part
But I ain't tryin to hear 'em like a pussy fart
And now they all searchin for my rookie card
Keep your motherfuckin hands out the cookie jar
Class is in session, check the scorecard
Yes I work hard like male porn stars
No the applause isn't necessary
You dyin to get into my show like a cemetery (ha)

[Hook - Classified]
Turn me up a little more (more)
Fresh 'til we exit the door (ha)
Yeah, we breakin in your eardrums
Ready or not, here it comes (here it comes, here it comes)

Turn me up a little louder (what?)
Crank the amp to full power (yeah)
We do it every night and all day (all day, all day, all day)
(So), you better get out the way

We-we-we do it (fresh, fresh, fresh)
You better get out the way
We-we-we do it (fresh, fresh, fresh)
(Turn me up a little more)

[Verse 2 - Classified]
Yeah, yeah, aiyyo, last year I got new management
This year I needed new management
I felt like they never knew what manage meant
Well good luck to them, I just had to vent
I spit what I live, speak what I know
Set the roof on fire, now you freeze in the cold
Think that I'm paid? Nope, I ain't loaded
But this drink got me feelin pretty loaded
Body all bloated, bit of a beer belly
Broke bottles of booze, can anybody help me?
It ain't a cry for help but in hindsight
I don't want to live the life, I want my life
I've been drinkin, been smokin, been high
Been thinkin, been hopin I'll get by
Shit I ain't nothin astoundin
From the underground so of course I stay grounded (ha)

Turn me up a little more (more)
Fresh 'til we exit the door (ha)
Yeah, we breakin in your eardrums
Ready or not, here it comes (here it comes, here it comes)

Turn me up a little louder (what?)
Crank the anthem full power (yeah)
We do it every night and all day (all day, all day, all day)
(So), you better get out the way

We-we-we do it (fresh, fresh, fresh)
You better get out the way
We-we-we do it (fresh, fresh, fresh)
You better get out the way (fresh, fresh, fresh)
You better get out the way
We do it (fresh, fresh, fresh)
(Turn me up a little more)

[Verse 3 - Classified]
Yeah, yeah, I don't do what I'm suppose to
From the old school, look at what we rose to
From the middle of nowhere to the center of it all
Through the ups and the downs, I'm rememberin it all
I take the good with the bad
Learned to be content with the things that I have
This whole world's fucked up and we all need more
And once we get it, we'll find something else we need to reach for
Dreams, life, work, rights
Hate, love, Northern Lights
I know life is good but I had my doubts
I'm a positive person with a negative approach (ha)

Ready or not, here it comes (here it comes, here it comes)

Turn me up a little louder (what?)
Crank the anthem full power (yeah)
We do it every night and all day (all day, all day, all day)
(So), you better get out the way
You better get out the way
You better get out the way
You better get out the way
