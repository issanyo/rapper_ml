[Intro]
When they see me walk, when they see me walk, when they hear me talk, when they hear me talk, when they see me walk, when they see me walk, when they hear me talk, when they hear me talk

[Verse 1]
Yeah, I don’t know if they’re ready but they’re watching me heavy, They’ll never get me but they know that I’m rockin’ it steady, You better seize your moment like you got epilepsy, These MC’s are choking just like Jian Ghomeshi, You get chopped like Machete like trying to pop like confetti, They wanna break a barrel like Walter and Jessie, I’ll put you on Ice, I’m like Walter to Gretzky, I’m like Barney to Betty, rocking like Marty Jannetty, I got ‘em waiting for it, take a look inside of my mind, Einstein, I don’t follow any guidelines, Enough Prime times mixed with these spliffs and the White Wine, I think I need some sleep and some iodine, And some Vitamin D, I got a deficiency, Cause I’ve been mixing these beats, And I’ve been in the studio, I don’t know, 'bout 5 or 6 weeks, try to get what I need, full steam till it gets done, then you’ll see me re-emerge back to the sun, I’m about to break the odds, I’m a million to 1. You got it backwards, don’t mistake my weakness for kindness. I don’t fit the current mold, what I do is timeless

[Chorus]
When they see me walk, when they see me walk
They don’t gotta, they don’t gotta pay me no mind
When they hear me talk, when they hear me talk
‘cause you ain’t never, you ain’t never heard of my kind
When they see me walk, when they see me walk
And I can see it in their face
When they hear me talk, when they hear me talk
Cause every time we in the place they say…
Oh no, here comes trouble, look the other way, oh no, here comes trouble, you better look the other way
Oh no, here comes trouble, look the other way, oh no, here comes trouble, you better look the other way

[Verse 2]
Shhh, naw we don’t ever quiet down, up till 5 in the morning in Chinatown buying rounds, Got my people with me, going city to city, my committee is road scholars playing for no ballers, hitting the strip club but none of us throw up dollars, bunch of cheapskates this visa ain’t prepaid, plus I owe the weed-man, I’m already a week late, and he’ll cut me off like Brutus the Barber Beefcake, Oh, I don’t pay for pussy, that ain’t how I roll, I don’t ever pay to get off like a bridge toll, but I pay the bills, keep the stove hot and the fridge cold, I handle mine, that’s just how shit goes, my daughters’ and my wife’s name are tattooed on my body, I don’t need to make a will cause everywhere I got its on me, literally, I bring the game to life like  it's Jumanji, I'm tryin to give the world a piece of me like I was Gandhi, Check it, they expect me to say I’m the best in the city, but when its arguably true then what there really to prove, check it, I gotta say it to remind kids, I ain’t trying to fit the current mold, this is timeless

[Chorus]
When they see me walk, when they see me walk
They don’t gotta, they don’t gotta pay me no mind
When they hear me talk, when they hear me talk
‘cause you ain’t never, you ain’t never heard of my kind
When they see me walk, when they see me walk
And I can see it in their face
When they hear me talk, when they hear me talk
Cause every time we in the place they say…
Oh no, here comes trouble, look the other way, oh no, here comes trouble, you better look the other way
Oh no, here comes trouble, look the other way, oh no, here comes trouble, you better look the other way
