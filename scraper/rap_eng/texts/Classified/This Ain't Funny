[Hook]
Now this ain't funny so don't you dare laugh
If you from the East then raise your beer glass
I'm out in the woods, follow the deer track
But watch out for wolves, hunters, and bear traps

[Verse 1: Mike Boyd]
I'm sarcastic over the top you dumb fuckers
Like Suge Knight and The Game me and Luke blood brothers
Go hard like butter left out of the fridge uncovered
Take Mother Theresa to the steeple nunchuk her
Mike Boyd  yes none other, huh
Flow tighter than you rappers wearing nut-huggers
Rum chugger, blunt puffer, came to make this whole planet rock Afrika Bambaataa

[Verse 2: Classified]
I got three kids and a four-wheeler (pimpin')
I eat donairs and tortillas ain't nobody more-realer
Class got it goin' on like the show's about to start
Trying to stay afloat up on this ocean like Noah arc
Welcome to the Terrordome
Where bitches are prepared to bone, show it all like Sharon Stone
But I'm chilling here at home, and I'm a happy fellow
I hit it baritone and make my girl falsetto

[Hook]
Now this ain't funny so don't you dare laugh
If you from the East then raise your beer glass
I'm out in the woods, follow the deer track
But watch out for wolves, hunters, and bear traps

[Verse 3: Mike Boyd]
My dick strong, your dick weak
My dick grown, your dick shrink
Old chicks wink when I go 'N Sync
They go OMG for this old emcee
Why shout out you? You don't shout out me
Judging books by their cover, you don't know 'bout me
Yes my lines be grosser than an outhouse see
With more potency than the trees we grow out East

[Verse 4: Classified]
Hey yo it's time for some action like the Navy Seals
I don't want to hit the club though, like, baby seals
I grew up in the 80's when it was crazy real
When rappers never shot off at the mouth they aimed to kill
Don't be mad 'cause I sound a bit sarcastic
The lyricals and visuals we give are graphic
I got my back pack packed practising this black magic
It's half-life bitch but we don't ever half ass it

[Hook]
Now this ain't funny so don't you dare laugh
If you from the East then raise your beer glass
I'm out in the woods, follow the deer track
But watch out for wolves, hunters, and bear traps
