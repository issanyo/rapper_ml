[Intro]
Ooh love, you got me so mad
I give you all of my lovin'
Best that you've ever had
Ooh love
Ooh love

[Verse 1]
I wanna settle down, stop lookin'
Spend all my time not worryin'
I wanna find the one to spend all of my days
I want it to be you, I'm crazy for you, babe

[Chorus]
Ooh love, you got me so mad
I give you all of my lovin'
Best that you've ever had
Ooh love, you're not treating me right
I got my shoes on now
I might be leaving tonight
You're gonna miss me in the morning
You're gonna miss me in the morning

[Verse 2]
It's been so nice to spend the time
Searching for clues to ease my mind
But I can't relax and I can't move on
Are you that someone?
Are you that someone?

[Chorus]
Ooh love, you got me so mad
I give you all of my lovin'
Best that you've ever had
Ooh love, you're not treating me right
I got my shoes on now
I might be leaving tonight
You're gonna miss me in the morning
I might be leaving tonight
You're gonna miss me in the morning
I might be leaving tonight

[Verse 3]
I wanna settle down, stop looking
Spend all my time not worrying
I wanna find the one to spend all of my days
I want it to be you, I'm crazy for you, babe

[Chorus]
Ooh love, you got me so mad
I give you all of my lovin'
Best that you've ever had
Ooh love, you're not treating me right
I got my shoes on now
I might be leaving tonight
You're gonna miss me in the morning
I might be leaving tonight
You're gonna miss me in the morning
I might be leaving tonight
