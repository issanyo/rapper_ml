[Chorus]
She been waiting for me through the whole night
Candle burning high on a cold night
Waiting in the dark with the low light
Got me feeling good when she hold tight

[Bridge]
She ain't gotta do much (ain't gotta do much)
Ain't gotta do much (ain't gotta do much)
She ain't gotta do much (ain't gotta do much)
Ain't gotta do much (ain't gotta do much)

[Verse 1]
Yeah, look
I'll be frank, I ain't a ladies' man
Got no Mercedes-Benz
Style's weak, got a pasty tan
But this girl rock a fella like a Jay-Z fan
And she tell me that I'm cuter than a baby lamb
Damn, I know it's corny as shit
But look, I'm almost 40 with this
I ain't just some horny kid
I need a chick I can hang with and bang with
Understand me, I ain't talkin' 'bout language
We watch a movie then we laugh about it, uh
Smoke a doobie then we laugh about it, uh
We argue then we laugh about it
She got me smilin' ain't no way around it

[Chorus]
Now she waiting for me through the whole night
Candle burning high on a cold night
Waiting in the dark with the low light
Got me feeling good when she hold tight

[Refrain]
She ain't gotta overdo it 'cause she do it good
Took me to a place that nobody could
Told me what I need on a long day
A little bit of her goes a long way
She ain't gotta do much
Waiting all night (all night)
She been waiting on me all night
She ain't gotta do much
Wait-waiting waiting all night
She been waiting on me all-all night

[Verse 2]
Yeah, you don't gotta overdo it to impress me
Twerking in your selfie don't impress me
Lady in the street, a freak in the bed sheets
Never trying too hard 'til it's real sexually, uh
I'm curious, I wanna see her naked
Maybe 'cause she leaves a bit to the imagination
She don't give everybody an open invitation
I guess that's why I'm fascinated
Look, she ain't a boss bitch
She's the boss, bitch
Literally, her job is to run the office
And she'll tell you it herself she ain't flawless
But she come up like a goddess
And now

[Chorus]
Now she waiting for me through the whole night
Candle burning high on a cold night
Waiting in the dark with the low light
Got me feeling good when she hold tight

[Refrain]
She ain't gotta overdo it 'cause she do it good
Took me to a place that nobody could
Told me what I need on a long day
A little bit of her goes a long way
She ain't gotta do much
Waiting all night (all night)
She been waiting on me all night
She ain't gotta do much
Wait-waiting waiting all night
She been waiting on me all-all night

[Verse 3]
Yeah, looking like the girl next door
Real chick, real shit's what I check for
And she don't need to compete
Ain't wearing overpriced clothes, but she never looks cheap
But she don't let everybody get on her body
Even though they wanna pipe her like Rowdy Roddy
Told me all I gotta do is treat her properly
And then she'll show me how to do these naughty things

[Chorus]
Now she waiting for me through the whole night
Candle burning high on a cold night
Waiting in the dark with the low light
Got me feeling good when she hold tight

[Refrain]
She ain't gotta overdo it 'cause she do it good
Took me to a place that nobody could
Told me what I need on a long day
A little bit of her goes a long way
She ain't gotta do much
Waiting all night (all night)
She been waiting on me all night
She ain't gotta do much
Wait-waiting waiting all night
She been waiting on me all-all night

[Outro]
Yeah
She been waiting on me all-all night (all night, all night)
Waiting all night
She been waiting on me all-all night (all night, all night)
