All these thoughts on fire, fire
All these thoughts on fire, fire
It would tear me apart to think that you were lying
All these thoughts on fire

And I didn't listen to your negative reasons
I don't got time for that sort of thinking
I'm unaware if you're trying to bring me down
Too busy thinking better thoughts
And I love that so much

I believe, I believe, I believe
I can do it if I want
I believe, I believe
I can do it if I want
I believe, I believe
That everyone's with me

All these thoughts on fire, fire
All these thoughts on fire, fire
If they tell you you can't, they're a liar, liar
All these thoughts on fire

Now hold your head up high and listen, listen
No when is good advice, but don't care what they're thinking
And I'll race you to the finish line
I was your favorite underdog
I'm gonna miss that so much

I believe, I believe, I believe
I can do it if I want
I believe, I believe
I can do it if I want
I believe, I believe
That everyone's with me

All these thoughts on fire, fire
All these thoughts on fire, fire
If they tell you you can't, they're a liar, liar
All these thoughts on fire

[Classified:]
Yeah, I was dreaming with a conscience
Tryin' to stay away from all the cheating and the nonsense
Avoiding all the demons and the monsters
But all these evil demons are the reason that I'm strongest
When I started this I knew that I would conquer
Back when there was no one ever screaming at my concert
Back when there was not a person even at my concert
They were sleeping on me but they ain't sleeping any longer
My thoughts are on fire, I believe, I believe
I was worn out and tired, now I'm free, I can breathe
When they try to hold you back, you push them back harder
Let em know what's on your mind and then you push a little further
