[Verse 1: Classified ft. Mike Boyd (Samples)]
(Shots Fired) (4x)
Warning, warning this is not a simulation
Space Invaders, space invading
Command and conquer
Break the gate in
I’m about to find my inner Ninja Gaiden
Two katanas, Blades of Steel
Duck when I hunt, ‘cause I aim to kill
I’m a trained soldier on the Battlefield
I know the game is the fake but the pain is real
I Duke Nukem, hit ‘em with the shells
That’s Koopa troopin’ 'em, I’ma give ‘em hell
I'mma Hadouken 'em
Spill your lunch out when you get punched out with a one, two on ‘em
Kung fuin’ ‘em, done, through with ‘em
Hitman for hire, duffle baggin’ ‘em
I shoot to kill, no Ronald Reagan
We spittin’ fire, we Double Dragons
This Mortal Combat-bat
In a World of Warcraft-craft
You can hear the swords clash, clash
Get your high score smashed, smashed
Got my phaser set to vaporize
I’ma put you on ice, skate or die
No role playin’, I’m protagin’ when I grab the controller, say goodbye

[Chorus: Classified & Mike Boyd (Samples)]
I be up on it
No way, no you don’t want it
Power down your electronics
My game is supersonic, its supersonic
I be up on it
(I get to play these games
I can’t stop playing, I- I can’t stop playing)
I be up on it
(I get to play these games
I can’t stop playing, I- I can’t stop playing)

[Verse 2: Classified ft. Mike Boyd (Samples)]
Alley-oop, Alley-oop, Alley-oop
Game on,rally the troops
On to NBA, get my boot in your ass better watch that attitude
Oh, the saga continues
Why?
Hit save on the menu
I got game with the ladies, Leisure Suit Larry in the bedroom
I’m a Mega Man, I’m mega mad
Flipping you the Angry Bird
Don’t push my buttons, circle, square, x or triangular
Got a Need for Speed like Arriba Arriba, Andale Andale
Up, up, down, down, left, right, left, right, B, A, Start
C’mon Mike concentrate
I roll with thirty men like the Contra game
You got a console in your console
Still play online at your mom’s home
Talkin’ shit in Grand Theft Auto
I’m a Street Fighter, Just Dance with me
Game over, no Final Fantasy
You bet your life, I up the ante
Your games weak, and I crush candy
[?]
Eat a mushroom, grow
Everyday I’m getting stoned
Like a Tanooki costume
I got TurboGrafx, sixteens
Don’t play around with this team
We got two players, split screen
Its Halflife

[Chorus: Classified & Mike Boyd (Samples)]
I be up on it
No way, no you don’t want it
Power down your electronics
My game is supersonic, its supersonic
I be up on it
(I get to play these games
I can’t stop playing, I- I can’t stop playing)
I be up on it
(I get to play these games
I can’t stop playing, I- I can’t stop playing)

[Break]
I know I keep getting older
But I can’t put down the controller
She hates it ‘cause I’m always playing these games, playing these games, playing these games
Been up all night with a couple friends
Smoking something, here we go again
She hates it ‘cause I’m always playing these games, playing these games, playing these games
