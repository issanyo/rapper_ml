[Intro: Classified & Samples]
Alright
Word to my granny and my daddy and my mother
Give me a sec
No one said having kids is easy

[Verse 1]
Alright kids, settle down
Run into the other room
Daddy needs a couple minutes
No more comin' the booth
Shit it's hard to raise kids, sorry, shouldn't swear
Well, not around the youngins'
They'll repeat what they hear
How come ever since I had kids life switched up
Now I gotta watch over my shoulder when I twist up
I can't even smoke in my own house, it's tough
I'm trying to stay positive but sometimes kids suck
I'm trying to get 'em on a schedule
Come on, eat your vegetables don't throw them on the floor please
I need a break and the wife need a date
But we fall asleep at eight reading bed time stories
I should be going out, supposed to be a rap star
Instead I'm home, watching Frozen and Madagascar
Cars or Babar, some other crap I don't really want to watch
My whole social life is falling off
Thanks kids
What? I ain't bought enough for you?
You want to cry for something new, here's a handkerchief
And if you keep it up, don't think I won't spank a kid
I don't know if I can handle this
Man I was living the dream

[Chorus 1: Classified & Samples]
Then I woke up, up, up
I heard the baby crying in the other room
Screaming and cryin'
I'm tryna sleep
Then I woke up, up
I'm at my whits end, about to loose it
If it ain't one thing, it's a motherfucking nother
Word to my granny and my daddy and my mother
If it ain't one thing, it's a motherfucking nother
Word to my granny and my daddy and my mother
Daddy and my mother
Daddy and my mother
Never said having kids was easy
Word to my daddy and my mother
My daddy and my mother

[Verse 2]
Man, I'm trying to stay confident
But I think I'm finally loosing it
Lord please help me, I'm praying to the crucifix
Weed makes me calm but gotta smoke outdoors
And can't watch porn on my home computer no more
Cause pop-ups will pop-up, and I ain't havin' that
Used to have patience with kids
Now I'm lackin' that
No, no more questions I thought I made this shit clear
Kids were not there yet, we'll be there when we get there
Now sit down
These kids always diss me
I bought a couch last week, they wrecked a couch week this week
Takin' home for dinner because they say they're hungry
Barely eat a thing, what a fucking waste of money
Sorry I'm still cursing, look what they makin' of me
I want the last slice
They always take it from me
So it's all about them now yeah, not about me
"Daddy are you done?"
No I'm not, now get out please
I'm tryin' to work so I can pay for that shirt you're growing out of
Baby that's my motive
I take the good with the bad
That's what change will bring
It's tough to being a good dad but wouldn't change a thing
My life's a dream


[Chorus: Classified & Samples]
Then I woke up, up, up
I heard the baby crying in the other room
Screaming and cryin'
So I got up I can't leave her in the other room
Screaming and cryin'
I'm at my whits end, about to loose it
If it ain't one thing, it's a motherfucking nother
Word to my granny and my daddy and my mother
If it ain't one thing, it's a motherfucking nother
Word to my granny and my daddy and my mother
Daddy and my mother
Daddy and my mother
Never said having kids was easy
Word to my daddy and my mother
My daddy and my mother
Never said having kids was easy

[Interlude]
I'm just playing
I love my kids, I just need some sleep though
It's pretty bad when you got to go on tour to get sleep
It's not even just my kids man, it's my boys kids
I never to get to hangout with my friends anymore
Let your parents come out

[Outro: Classified & Samples]
I can't watch what I want to watch on TV
Can't play any of my old rap CD's
And every movie that we watch is PG
Never said having kids was easy
Never said having kids was easy
Never said having kids was easy
