[Verse 1 - Classified] [Scratched Sample]
They want to say that I'm a cheap skate (yeah), grindin 'til my teeth ache [gone] (ha)
But please wait, let me speak over this beat break (Class)
I won't ever Jackpot or win the sweepstakes [gone] (nope)
I'll jack pot when I steal it from your weed bags (haha)
Smokin marijuana 'til I can't see straight [gone]
But these days it takes more for me to seem blazed
For Pete's sakes, I ain't tryin to be a mooch [gone] (what?)
You ain't tryin to share, quit tryin to be a scrooge
Kid at lunch break always bummin for a dime [gone] (yeah)
Pissin people off, always buttin into line (yeah)
Takin what I can, always get in where I fit in [gone] (right)
Tight with my cash 'cause I rap for a livin (ha)
Not a greedy cat but a pretty cheap cat [gone]
I know what I'm about, you can keep your feed-back
Record label hate me 'cause I talk like I'm broke [gone]
They try to build my image but fuck 'em, what they know? (oh!)

[Verse 2 - Classified] [Scratched Sample]
And I ain't tryin to hear you, I'm tryin to smoke this, move off [gone]
Plus I'm in the middle of this 12 pack like 2Pac (ha)
And don't get all offensive (shit), cool off [gone]
Oh, now you name callin, I'm a bitch and too soft
I've been labeled everything, every name in the book [gone]
I've been dissed by many man but I'm stayin here put
Y'all ain't sayin shit to me, 'cause your word don't get to me [gone]
Givin lip to me, 'cause you want to live through me
Oh, jealousy it'll get to the best of 'em [gone]
Funny I ain't shit, but they think it's a step for 'em
They listen right now and think it's addressin them [gone]
Think you hit a nerve?  Motherfucker just guess again, and
("And there's nothin"), nothin you could tell me
We "Perfect Strangers", shut it cousin Balki
I ain't a sucker, ain't nothin you could sell me [gone]
Class won't be taught, then I'll pass on your offerin (yeah)
Cheap skate, growin up a hockey player [gone], had the cheap skates
Try workin out but only usin free weights (get it)
This mind frame keepin me paid [gone]
I'm in the game like EA, so bring it back DJ
