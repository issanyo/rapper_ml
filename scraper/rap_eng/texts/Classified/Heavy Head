[Chorus]
The heavy head wears a crown
But it's never going to bring me down
Cause I don't need it
I don't need it
The heavy head wears a crown
But it's never going to bring me down
Cause I don't need it
I don't need it
I could throw it away
I could leave it all behind, it's all the same

[Verse 1]
Uh, I'm a ninety-five, shit
Yea, I remember when I started back in nine-five
I was just a bright eyed white guy
All I ever had to do was make beats and write rhymes
From the days of no wi-fi and high-fives
Look how time flies by you'd think I had nine lives
When I was on the come up they celebrated
Then they started hating when I finally started elevating
Now they try to twist my words to try to bring me down, like
(did you say rape?, Yea Class supports rape now)
Damn, even all the press try to eat it up
And now its cheap as fuck, but anything for a buck
I don't do this for the money or respect
I get enough of both of them, I'm just waiting to go collect
You get a little success, they get a little upset
They would rather see you strugglin', then making progress
And yes, every show used to be a night to be remembered
Now I can't even remember last night's show, so

[Chorus]
The heavy head wears a crown
But it's never going to bring me down
Cause I don't need it
I don't need it
The heavy head wears a crown
But it's never going to bring me down
Cause I don't need it
I don't need it
I could throw it away
I could leave it all behind, it's all the same

[Verse 2]
I just signed a worldwide deal
But I don't really know how I feel
I don't think they understand what I am about or where I come from
But I guess I'm the dumb one for signing on the dotted line
I put a lot of time in and got a lot to lose
So I ain't doing anything that I don't wanna do
Thinking that I'm a pop act, cause I had one pop track
That popped off
Thought they did their homework, guess not
They wanted me to work with Cody Simpson, Really?
They wanted me to work with Simple Plan, Really?
I said it ain't my thing, they got mad
Try to force me, like
You better do it, if I want the team to support me
Look, I got my own thing, in my own country
And I'm so comfy I ain't going to change for no money
I ain't trying to pass blame for the spot I'm in
But I hope you understand what kind of artist your signing

[Chorus]
The heavy head wears the crown
But it's never going to bring me down
Cause I don't need it
I don't need it
The heavy head wears the crown
But it's never going to bring me down
Cause I don't need it
(Yea, I'm good where I'm at)
I don't need it
(You want it all? You can have it back)
Cause I can throw it away
I can leave it all behind, it's all the same

[Verse 3]
I love the rush, love performing, I don't wanna leave
But, it's the planes and the traveling that I don't need
I love the fans, love the hour that I get on stage
But hate the stakes, you still haven't learned how to behave
This games a chop shop
To the originals and knock-offs
A bunch of bitches trying to be top-dog
Fighting for that top spot
I got nothing left to prove
Everything I wanted to do, kid, I did it
I'm finished, enough small talk
Maybe its time I just drop the mic and just walk off

[Outro]
I could throw it away
I could leave it all behind, it's all the same
