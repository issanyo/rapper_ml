[Verse 1:]
Yeah, Yo... Listen
Now I've Got Love For Somethings That I Gotta Confess
Got Alot Of Small Talk That I'm Putting To Rest
Gotta Beat Guarnteed That'll Snap Ya Neck
I Got Love For My Weed And My Unemployement Cheques
(Yes) I'm Still Making My Call
Love My Girl , This World, But Don't Recycle At All
I Got Love For Player Haters, Fuck It, I Am One
I'm Jealous As Hell, I'm Waiting For My Chance Son
I Do This Hands On
Still In Progress.. Still Ain't Won, But I Guess I Never Lost Yet
I Gotta Give It Up To Mc's Who Spit Dope
(Why?) Cause You Inspire Me To Dubble Check What I Wrote
Wack Mc's Love It When They Come Out
Cause Wack Rappers, Give Me Something To Write About
Like Right Now, You Bite, And I'll Bite Down
Cut You Off, You Out Of Sight Now
Critics, Gotta Love Them, Put Your Flame Up
Cause When You Dissin, You Make Me Step My Game Up
Check The Change Up, Been Ill Since I Came Up
Runnin' This On Empty And Still Fill Your Brain Up

[Chorus: x2]
Now Let Me Get This Off My Brian
I Got Love For Some Things
That I Never Thought Could Happen
But Anything Could Change
I Got Love For My People And Everyone Of My Foes
And Anyone In This Game Who Keeps Me Fresh On My Toes

[Verse 2:]
Everyone's A Rapper Now, Their Ain't No Hip Hop Fans
Everybodys On The Mic, It's Time To Get Off Man
You Ain't Built For The Game I Hit Like Rock Bands
Your Fruity Loops Beats Don't Hit Like "Ah Damn!"
Ex 9 To 5'er
Class, Still Building
And With A Small Studio
And Doing Shows At The Pavilion
I Use To Love Getting Taxed By The Goverment
Cause Now I'm Home, Getting Paid And I'm Loving It
Yo ,I Got Laid Off
Now I'm Paid Off
For The Next Year Or So
So I Got A Year To Blow
Understand? I Always Have A Plan And I'll Follow It
Spit This With Pride, Cause You'll Never See Me Swollow It
Plus
You Gotta Love A Girl With Class
And If You Can't Understand Then Go Back And Do The Math
I Ain't A Concious Rapper But Still State My Views
I'm A Kid At Heart, Watching Sports Entertainment Pay Per Views
And I Hating You, Kid I Got Love
Go Ahead And Diss Me Spread My Name Through The Club
I Could Use The Marketing, Huh I Got The Skill
I Just Gotta Get My Name Out And Continue To Build

[Chorus: x2]
Now Let Me Get This Off My Brian
I Got Love For Some Things
That I Never Thought Could Happen
But Anything Could Change
I Got Love For My People And Everyone Of My Foes
And Anyone In This Game Who Keeps Me Fresh On My Toes
