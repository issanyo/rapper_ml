[Intro:]
[Classified:] Man, remember tape cassettes?
[Mic Boyd:] Tape cassettes? !
[Classified:] I remember goin into record stores, gettin so excited
For that new album, you know?
When you got it, is was like nothin else mattered
[Mic Boyd:] Oh yeah, yeah, I guess, you had to pay for that shit
[Classified:] Yeah man, it's not like that anymore
Kind of feel, kind of feelin like damn
When they used to say they don't make music like they used to
(The way it used to be)
[Mic Boyd:] No, I see what you're sayin man, I see what you're sayin
[Classified:] Check this out, look, yeah
[Mic Boyd:] What you got?

[Verse 1: Classified]
My, my, my, my dad says they don't make music like they use to
And nowadays there ain't no record store to root through
We upload and then we viewin' it on YouTube
Digital to Bluetooth, I see why that confuse you
This day and age, shit it's hard to tell who's who
So many artists, every week you hear a new group
Maybe it's me or possibly I got a screw loose
A raisin short of two scoops but we don't do what you do (do, do)

[Verse 2: Mic Boyd]
Now-now-now-nowadays when I turn on the radio (yeah)
It's like they take the same old song and play it out (true)
Might be your favorite now but hate it in a day or so
Here today, gone tomorrow, that's how the saying goes
The oldies were timeless and classic (that's right)
Music now is models and actress (ah naw)
Who we pay to ogle they asses (yeah)
Never liked metal but still prefer it to plastic

[Hook: Classified (Mic Boyd) - w/ ad libs]
My dad says they don't make music like they use to
(Oh no they don't, no they don't, no they don't)
And my crew says they don't make beats like they use to
(Oh no they don't, no they don't, no they don't)
You know what I-I think? It's just the music that I'm use to
(It's what I'm use to, it's what I'm use to)
I need my headphones louder, louder, louder, louder, louder, louder, louder, louder

[Verse 3: Mic Boyd]
Drum machines with touch screens, this must be the future
One man band all recorded on computer
Cubase, Cakewalk and Pro Tools users
Filtered effects and overused Auto-Tuners
(If you can't hit the note), then hit a switch
Artists can't get the pitch and end up [Auto-Tune voice] "singing like this"
Sounds like robots are takin our jobs
While these same record labels keep on payin 'em off

[Verse 4: Classified]
Now have you ever thought about the old records we were proud to play (yeah)
And if you heard them for the first time nowadays? (yeah)
Would we give the same props, same amount of praise? (nope)
I highly doubt it eh, it'd probably sound out of date (yeah)
Or maybe life nowadays kind of cloud our taste (yeah)
And hearin old tracks takes us back around the way (woo)
Yeah, still soundin great, off to outer space
Without a trace, leavin eardrums bent out of shape

[Hook: w/ ad libs]

[Outro: (Sample from "Back in the Day" by Ahmad)]
[Classified:] Yeah, the records that I play (back in the days)
[Mic Boyd:] You know the clothes that I wear (back in the days)
[Classified:] Haha, hey yo people! {you should know just how I feel}
[Classified:] When?
(Back in the days when I was young, I'm not a kid anymore) [echo]
