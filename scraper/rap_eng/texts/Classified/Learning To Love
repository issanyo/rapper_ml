Learning to love is like learning to breath
It’s not something your taught or something you read
It’s something you learn dancing cheek to cheek
When your heart starts to burn and you feel so weak

Learning to love is a leap of faith
It’s holding on instead of running away
Instead of giving up, it’s a kiss goodnight
It’s waking up by your side

Cause you show me the way
I’m here to stay
With every touch of your hand
And every word that you say
You show me the way

Learning to love can be losing game
A shot in the dark at a runaway train
But learning to love is like learning to fly
You can crash from the fall but you still gotta try

And you show me the way
I’m here to stay
With every touch of your hand
And every word that you say
You show me the way

Leaning to love is not something I knew
It’s something I learned because of you
And now I see just what they mean..
When they say learning to love is like learning to breath…

You show me the way
I’m here to stay
With every touch of your hand
And every word that you say
You show me the way

You show me the way
I’m here to stay
With every touch of your hand
And every word that you say
You show me the way
