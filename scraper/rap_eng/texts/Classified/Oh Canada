[Intro]
O Canada! We stand on guard, for thee
O Canada!
O Canada!
O Canada!
O Canada!

[Classified talking behind intro]
I told this guy where I was from
He said, oh, Canada
Kind of laughed it off, real funny, huh
Yeah, uh, come on
One two, one two
Mic. check, one two, one two
Yeah

[Verse 1]
Uh, yeah, from the land of the lost, Trans-Canada cross
Patriotic and I honor with my hand on my heart
From the greatest of lakes to the greenest of greens
To the rockiest mountains and everything in between
Oh Canada, oh you no fan of us
Cause our movies and TV shows are so amateur
Yes we laugh it off, that don't really bother me
Look we ain't serious unless we really got to be
Humorous attitude like Kids In The Hall
Or Jim Carrey, Mike Myers, hell we claimin 'em all
It's the great white north, home of the funniest actors
The butt of the joke with an abundance of laughter
The red and white flag, keep it high, keep it visual
People say Canada and get stereotypical
Think we finish every sentence with buddy or bye
And if it ain't that, it's either dude, eh, or guy
Canada eh, yeah we considerate people
And smokin marijuana, we consider it legal
Still doin' rap like the 1990s
But that's how we like it, off time and grimy

[Refrain]
I know where I'm from and I told ya before
North of America, hard to ignore
Every-time I go away I tell them for sure
I'm from Canada, oh-oh-oh Canada
Oh Canada, oh-oh-oh Canada
I'm from Canada, oh-oh-oh Canada

[Verse 2]
I've been around the globe and heard the confusion
Honestly a lot of y'all are ignorant and stupid
Yes, we have microwaves, TVs and cell phones
Unintelligent fuck, we invented the telephone
We made Yahtzee, the lightbulb, hockey
And bred the greatest players, Gretzky to Crosby
We all got at least one drinkin' buddy
And after one drink, all of us think we're funny
Our national mascot's a damn beaver
Oh Canada, we love our beaver
Home of Hells Angels and RCMP
Home of Gordon Lightfoot and SCTV
No doubt, The Underground Railroad
Georges St-Pierre, right here is where he call home
Our health care system, y'all know it's free
Keep our girls bangin' with a full mouth of teeth
I won't even get into the music industry
They say hip-hop is dead, nah it's up north with me
I could do this all day, it's a part of my routine
But supper's almost done and tonight - poutine

[Refrain]
