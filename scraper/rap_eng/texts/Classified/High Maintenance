[Intro - Classified]
I'm so high, flying saucer racing on vacation in the sky over top the population

[Verse 1 - Classified]
Marijuana, Mary Jane, whatever you name it
Been smoking for a couple years and got no plan to change it
At 21 I started puffing just in moderation
Now I smoke like I'm Jamaican it's a daily operation
Plus within my occupation it's an obligation
Late night, cloudy room instrumental dominating
I'm so high strung, but I stay calm and patient
When I'm blazing, more focused than when I'm intoxicated
My parents always told me drugs are bad don't you ever take em
You'll be wasted and sedated talking sharp with God and Satan
Life is often changing though, nowadays they smoke a bit
After work "Puff Puff" and don't want no one knowing it
Oops I let the cat out the bag, what a drag
Don't be mad fam here take a drag
I'm a pot smoking pot head, I'm not ashamed to say it
Never hide it like a coke head its way too complicated
I'm laid back feeling good, yea I'm high maintenance
Puffing on a blunt go ahead try taking it

[Hook]
Rolling my weed another day goes by
I know what I need when I see the sun rise
I wanna believe I don't need to get high
But I gotta have it, cause I gotta habit, and I keep smoking
To maintain my high, smokin'
I need to maintain my high
Rolling my weed another day goes by
I know what I need when I see the sun rise
I wanna believe I don't need to get high
But I gotta have it, cause I gotta habit, and I keep smoking

[Verse 2 - Classified]
We got that hashish, dope, weed, however you say it
When it comes to chronic smoke Canada we have the greatest
And all my friends and peers have been smoking it for years
So it's hard for me to quit but I'm constantly contemplating
And my girls been complaining ever since her ovulating
Turned into her water breaking now she watches what she takes in
Kudos to my lady, but if I'm not mistaken
She's the reason I smoke a lot, man she used to smoke a lot
I use to say, damn girl get off the dope, stop
When I tried it though we grew together like a growing op
She means well I know that, I'm not complaining
I'm just color commenting, stepping back and observating
Shit I love it, but I see the complications
It's hard concentrating when I'm high song creating
Man I hate it, I mean I need it, I mean I hate it, I mean it
Shit I'm indecisive when I'm weeded
I need some high maintenance, I know it's long awaited
Plus I feel my tonsils aching, think it's from the pot I take in
