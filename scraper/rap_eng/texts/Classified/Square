[Intro]
I'm back up in it
It's been a while
What else can I tell yall
(Tell me something that I don't know)

[Verse 1: Classified]
Yeah, Yeah
My package is massive
Well, maybe not but bigger than average
And my knowledge in the sack is on tap with Dan Savage
Plus my touch is like magic and I fuck like jackrabbits
I give it my all whatever I practice
Imagine my driving bad when you look at what I put in this rap shit
Inspector gadget in the mattress
I'm rocking your university call me the big man on campus
I'm lying, I'm a square
Welcome to my world
Rap star, only slept with five girls
Amanda, Kelly, Julie, Megan and Kim
I should be thanking them but I hope they ain't mad at me for mentionin' 'em
And oh don't get me wrong me though
Been many others I been with
But these are the only ones that I would literally get it in with
Now I got three daughters
And when I tell people they say "God must be punishing you for your past history"
But my values never teeter-totter
I give these women the respect that they deserve
Look at how life works its such a mystery

[Chorus: Classified (Samples)]
Can you hear that?
That bang bang bang is the beat beat beat beat picking up
Quicker than a [?] tryina get over a [?]
[?]
If you want it I'ma give it you on top with full force
Everybody better give it up
I'm not what you see
But you better believe it
Everyday I breathe I-I-I live it up
I've got the key to my city and a tumor on my lungs
Never did it all but seen it all so I'm good when I'm done
Give me one minute of glory for every ten minutes of fame
Got my insecurities but keep it simple and plain
Kid I'm a square
Tell me something that I don't know
I'ma be square
Tell me something that I don't know
Yeah, Said I'm a square
Tell me something that I don't know
I'ma be square
Back to square one

[Verse 2: Classified]
I said, everything I say, I mean it
I never take back words
I live by four words:
"Don't ever go backwards"
Love for the outcasts and all of those who've been down
We don't pick the formal dress code
I walked out on an in crowd
Like "I don't need it"
Still never did no cocaine or angel dust or LSD
Ain't never dropped MDMA
I'm square right?
But I wouldn't have it any other way
Just look at my life
Sitting waiting on judgement day, like "I'm good"
I drink my liquor, smoke my marijuana
Making grands like Ariana but I ain't no prima donna
Yeah, so I tried to buy some life insurance
But they turned me down, so I saved the money
Blew it all on a white suburban
Thats a cliche I know it, but it was that or a minivan
And I can't pull that off, I ain't as cool as Remy Shand
Thats who I am, and theres many sides to this man
So I stay fly as I can but I'm cool right where I stand
Ah..

[Chorus: Classified (Samples)]
Can you hear that?
That bang bang bang is the beat beat beat beat picking up
Quicker than a [?] tryina get over a [?]
[?]
If you want it I'ma give it you on top with full force
Everybody better give it up
I'm not what you see
But you better believe it
Everyday I breathe I-I-I live it up
I've got the key to my city and a tumor on my lungs
Never did it all but seen it all so I'm good when I'm done
Give me one minute of glory for every ten minutes of fame
Got my insecurities but keep it simple and plain
Kid I'm a square
Tell me something that I don't know
I'ma be square
Tell me something that I don't know
Yeah, Said I'm a square
Tell me something that I don't know
I'ma be square
Back to square one

[Outro: Classified]
Just let the beat go
This is for all you MCs, all you rappers looking for something to write to
Go get 'em
