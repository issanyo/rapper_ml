[Chorus: Anjulie]
Shadows swimming in my head lately, I don't mind
See I'm not gonna let me go crazy, not this time
I'm going through changes, I'm gon' make it for sure
(I'm going, I'm going)
I'm going through changes, but I've been here before

[Verse 1: Classified]
Uh
I haven't stepped out of my house in seven days
Haven't shaved, haven't showered, haven't changed
Same clothes, different day
Another good morning pissed away, eh
Got the whole world looking right at me
Actually, feels like, people start to look past me
I've been around, feels like this just might be our last dance
I'm frustrated, I'm past tense, I still don't feel like a has-been
I don't but, it's like a ghost town up in the studio
Nobody comes around here no more
I guess that's just how the movie go, uh
I don't like playing my old friends new songs
They don't listen to rap like back when
They all grew up, kinda moved on
And how can I blame 'em, huh
I used to sleep, eat and breathe this shit
But now, the older I get, I'm questioning if I really needed this
I used to stress what people said
And what people thought about me
Now I worry about if my daughter
Can make it home from school without me
But still at the same time
As I'm writing this rhyme I'm in my kitchen
My daughter's trying to tell me about her day
I hear her, but not really listening
I'm staring at her, but in my head I'm putting these words together
I know that I need to do better
'Cause what I do now could change forever

[Chorus: Anjulie & Classified]
Shadows swimming in my head lately, I don't mind
(I'm going, I'm going)
See I'm not gonna let me go crazy, not this time
I'm going through changes, I'm gon' make it for sure
(Uh, it's a fall from paradise)
I'm going through changes, but I've been here before

[Verse 2]
Uh
And I know, I'm so indecisive these days
And musically I feel confused
Don't know what I'm liking these days
I'm just taking time to check all the new shit
Plus all of the drugs they doing
And I know I'm a hypocrite
I smoke these spliffs, only 'cause Snoop did
Hah, glad it was just weed
But even with that I'm noticing, I'm losing my passion
I'm getting too high, it's harder to focus with
And all of my pothead friends; they take pride in it, pride in it
And all my alcoholic friends; denying it, denying it
And all my cokehead friends; they still hiding it, hiding it
I'm just hoping all of us survive this shit, survive this shit
Damn, I was never too good at showing emotions
I get awkward at serious times
Uncomfortable in genuine moments
I ain't big on giving hugs
I use this music to show my love
That's why it's so important
But lately it don't seem so rewarding
Something's changed

[Chorus: Anjulie & Classified]
Shadows swimming in my head lately, I don't mind
(I know, I know)
See I'm not gonna let me go crazy, not this time
(I know, I know, I know)
I'm going through changes, I'm gon' make it for sure
(Uh, it's a fall from paradise)
I'm going through changes, but I've been here before
(Uh, let's go)

[Bridge: Anjulie]
Oooh, oooh, oooh
Changes
Oooh, oooh, oooh
Changes

[Verse 3: Classified]
They told me call it a day
They told me maybe that's it
Then I get these messages from my fans
Who tell me don't ever quit
'Cause my music saved their life
Like literally, they heard my song
On the way to the train tracks
And something I said's the reason they came back
I used to convince my fans just give me a chance
But now they're the ones convincing me
Now they're the ones convincing me, yeah
I used to convince the fans to believe in me and my truth
But now my fans believe in me
Maybe more than I do
