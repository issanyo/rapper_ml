[Verse 1: Suffa]
We went from spitting jams to fifty fans in a little cramped room
A shoebox you couldn’t fit a shoe in to touring
Switzerland with my man in a mini-van
Being the man of the minute can happen in a minute man
And it’s funny, I’ve seen buddies that I trust turn away
‘Cause money can’t buy you love but it can earn you hate
And none of you gave a fuck till the movement went large
Now every crew is making music, every dude has got bars
Now every half-arse bar fly up in the bar rhymes
We sit about, spitting ‘bout the dark and the hard times
But got perspective on the fighting for the crowns and such
When we encountered and old pal who had been down on his luck
In some Volleys pushing trolleys eating soup from a tin
My girls like "golly, man these pollie's aren’t improving a thing"
Well swap your worries for some Bolly, swap your suit for some wings
And fly with us, we light it up and it’s a beautiful thing

[Chorus: Cass Elliot (Sampled)]
They exploded the underground
They say it’s gonna happen, the underground
I heard they exploded the underground
They say it’s gonna happen, the underground

[Verse 2: Classified]
That’s where I started at, the days of Walkman’s and starter hats
The open mic nights mastering the art of rap
We man made, underground like an artifact
We don’t need to worry when the market crash
I’m from the bottom, bottom of new Scotland
Planted all my seeds watered them then watched it blossom
Then they try to tell me over time we’d be forgotten, rotten
Thinking that you’re gonna keep me boxed in? Nonsense
Hilltop and Class rock till your noggins nodding
You can walk in my shoes but never fit in my jeans
I do this with no option till my body’s old and rotten and exhausted, keep it going ‘cause I’m living my dream
Till the grave we’ll spit the pain and, when it comes to picture painting
We might be the illest rated with the visuals illustrated
That’s ill communication, therapy for life without the rehabilitation, keep waiting I’m about to blow up

[Chorus: Cass Elliot (Sampled)]
They exploded the underground
They say it’s gonna happen, the underground
I heard they exploded the underground
They say it’s gonna happen, the underground

[Verse 3: Pressure]
We about to blow it up, but we all started this as amateur
Carving out a path was a hardship for the traveller
It said that raps a façade, you’ll never manage it
In these parts, I guess it’s our scars that give us character
We misfits and slackers, at risk kids or hackers
With a wish list, sick of doing six shifts at Macca’s
From listeners to rappers, prestigious to hapless
I don’t need a gift to know that this shit is backwards
We’re done officially another visionary
Will lights the flame, write their name in their sweat, blood and infamy
It’s gutter symphony fuck the industry
Let them come, we’re the ones carving history
So we rhyme for the hurting, poor hard working for
International heard applaud to local suburban tour
Y’all gave a purpose for the roar when the curtains draw
Furthermore ask yourself what you’re searching for?

[Interlude: Samples]
"I'm about to blow up"
"The underground"

[Verse 4: Solo]
Follow me to a place I like to go
Liner notes are signposts to find that which lies below
Born in eighty-eight so I came in late
To find for the first time in life I felt right at home
Through the growing pains and hostile take overs
People trying to put us down like Beethoven
We stayed strong and remained focused
Until they had no other choice but to stand up and take notice
Never thought what I wrote on a page back in the day
Would ever have me catching a plane
Or rapping up on a stage
Staring out at the crowd in amazement
Thinking back on the days when
We were confined to the limitations of the basement
The subterranean kids became the main event
I pay respect to those who spent days laying foundations
Countdown to detonation (I'm about to blow up)

[Chorus: Cass Elliot (Sampled)]
They exploded the underground
They say it’s gonna happen, the underground
I heard they exploded the underground
They say it’s gonna happen, the underground
