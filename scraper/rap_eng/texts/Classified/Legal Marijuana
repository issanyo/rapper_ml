[Intro]
Canada eh, yeah we considerate people
And smokin' marijuana, we consider it legal

[Chorus]
When I'm chilling with my people then I'm smoking marijuana
Don't consider me a hippy when I'm smoking marijuana
I been having trouble sleeping so I'm smoking marijuana
Smoking, smoking marijuana, we consider it legal

[Verse 1]
Yeah
It's a return to the West Coast back eastward
Weed stashed in a cheap urn
But to roll up, another leaf burn, it's a reefer nation
I'll blaze to relieve frustration, yeah, yeah
It increase my patience, while I'm waiting on legalization
Oh all this indica, this sativa got me blessed like Mother Theresa
Forget my woes like amnesia when the THC start to creep up
I'm high all night like a sour bud
They say it's a gateway drug, but shit
I don't do no hard drugs, and don't plan to start up
But I light up in my studio, this job is so kushy
I've been doing this for decades, I don't smoke with no rookies
I been puffing on the purple, yeah the Kush is so OG
I been whipping up some Girl Scout Cookies like, oh goodie
I'll puff recreational, you puff on the medical
Feeling so incredible, someone break out the edibles
'Cause prohibition is almost out of commission
I'll be smoking anyway, not like it really makes a difference

[Chorus]
When I'm chilling with my people then I'm smoking marijuana
Don't consider me a hippy when I'm smoking marijuana
I been having trouble sleeping so I'm smoking marijuana
Yeah I'm smoking marijuana, we consider it legal

[Bridge]
Yeah, yeah, you don't like my (smoking marijuana)
How come you don't like my (smoking marijuana)
Yeah, yeah, you don't like me (smoking marijuana)
How come you don't like my (smoking marijuana)

[Verse 2]
This ain't that "Oh I love weed so much, let me brag about it"
Actually that's exactly what this is, it's so good let me brag about it
Won't go a full day without it, no there ain't no way around it
Dad used to complain about it
Now he can't get through his back pain without it
And I could list all the different ways that it brings relief and treats disease
Glaucoma, PTSD, cancer and epilepsy
But you know that, yeah, you know that even trees need love
That's why I always let my girl get with my BC bud
These moon rocks, moon rocks, got me feeling like Snoop Dogg
Only need to take a few hauls to get lifted up like a boob job
So blaze one for the nation, I been doing so since Day 1
I handle my business raising my kids and still they wanna go hate on
Yeah, I got kids and when they not around I'll probably go roll something
Don't judge me, you've got kids
And every night you crack a beer right in front of 'em
I don't need your opinion, either way I don't pay you attention
Light it up all day every night, yup, yup
Prohibition don't make no difference

[Chorus]
When I'm chilling with my people then I'm smoking marijuana
Don't consider me a hippy when I'm smoking marijuana
I been having trouble sleeping so I'm smoking marijuana
Yeah I'm smoking marijuana, we consider it legal

[Bridge]
Yeah, yeah, you don't like my (smoking marijuana)
How come you don't like my (smoking marijuana)
Yeah, yeah, you don't like me (smoking marijuana)
How come you don't like my (smoking marijuana)

[Outro]
Smoking marijuana, we consider it legal
