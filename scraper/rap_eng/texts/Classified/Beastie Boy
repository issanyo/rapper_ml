[Intro]
Okay, yeah

[Verse 1]
Look, I do what I do
I don't give two shits to who's watching
I'm that dude who got a clue who's acting cuckoo and indulgent
That Absolut and Grey Goose loosen Luke up when I'm rockin'
Got a screw loose like a loose tooth
Acting too cool's not an option
So who's going in then going out
Man, that's an easy choice
Fighting for my right to party like a Beastie Boy
I throw it up and drink it down
What, you don't need another
'Cause you don't hold your own, like surrogate mothers
My brother, wake up, wake up
Never sleep in and let the day pass me
From shotgun to the back seat
We full-throttle to half speed
We wiling, dialed in
We set it off, we never stop
So let it rock, 'til the Heavens call
And the Devil knock-knock-knocks on my door
My lord, take the wheel
Oh my lord, I pray for real
I'm always swinging for the fence
So clear the bench and take the field
I'm a never-ending number, I don't wonder I discover
I'm the one who gets it done before supper
Kid, I'm a Beastie Boy

[Chorus]
Last night you looking at me sideways (sideways)
'Cause you don't like the way I work (work, w-work)
I always do it my way (my way)
Why you wanna see me at my worst, like a Beastie Boy
Beastie Boy

[Verse 2]
Yeah, uh
I know that I need to grow up, I don't know what's coming (next)
I been trying to go the distance and they missing nothing (yet)
More in line and genuine when drinking wine and drunken (mess)
Feeling fine but over time I'm sure I'll find my sudden death
I don't panic, I'm balanced
I don't sit still like the mannequin challenge
I'm antsy, I'm wiling, this man can't be silenced
So check your head and check the dialogue
Forget the Tylenol, for the pain I'm fighting off
Can't tell me right or wrong
Uh, we waking up you deep sleepers
Shit starters and peace keepers
You vegans and you meat eaters
I'm needed now like bee keepers
The flow as cold as deep freezers
So put a coat over that t-shirt before you catch a deep fever
So cold, aw man but mood swings, mood swings
Only takes me a few drinks to tie one on like shoe strings
I'm 20 years old in a grown man's body
Enjoying the fruits of my labour like no man can stop me
Turn it up and let the beat play, I'm a Canadian emcee
Eh, and rock it time mix-master Mike DJ
I'm a Beastie Boy

[Chorus]
Last night you looking at me sideways (sideways)
'Cause you don't like the way I work (work, w-work)
I always do it my way (my way)
Why you wanna see me at my worst, like a Beastie Boy
Beastie Boy

[Outro]
'Cause I'm a Beastie Boy
They think that I'm a Beastie Boy
They think that I'm a mother fucking Beastie Boy
Think that I'm a Beastie Boy
