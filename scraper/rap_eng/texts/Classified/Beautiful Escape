[Chorus]
Just a dreamer
Shoutout to the sky, comin' from a believer
Wishin' upon a shooting star to be my savior
People tryin' run my life
Tellin' me to stop dreaming
I need to get away, beautiful escape

[Verse 1: Classified]
When I was young they told me to get it
I never paid them any mind, but slowly I did it
They told me "dream on dream on" you're over your limit
"You'll never make it" but I did and it's only beginning
Let me get away, dinners made, let me get a plate, and minute maid
Cause this games got a bitter taste
I want it though so I buckle down
Cause I'm from a town where you can't afford to fuck around
You need to get up and feel the wind blowin'
Got to get going
Take advantage of this moment, no tip-toeing
I dove in, head first, fully committed
It's all blood, sweat, tears, truly; I live it
They just goin' through the motions
Me? I'm trying to show emotions
I'm trying to get what's out of reach
Even though I know some people don't believe but I'm just a dreamer

[Chorus]
Just a dreamer
Shoutout to the sky, comin' from a believer
Wishin' upon a shooting star to be my savior
People tryin' run my life
Tellin' me to stop dreaming
I need to get away, beautiful escape

[Break]
Just me myself & I
Beautiful escape
Just me myself & I
Beautiful escape

[Verse 2: Classified]
When I wake up I see everything in 20/20
Funny money, got people acting all buddy-buddy
Mommy's hungry, somethin' growing in mommy's tummy
Love me or hate me but I'm doing what I gotta do
You, can't teach an old dog new tricks
But you never really fell until the moment you quit
True shit, own up if the shoe fits
At 36, this is as real as Luke gets
Cause I knew nobody would give me a handout
Or a chance and now look how it panned out
Hands down nah, it ain't a question that I get the hands up
Man up or I'm leavin'
It's a small world kids that's why I dream big
I'm proof that where you come from doesn't mean shit
I don't want to miss a thing so I dream with my eyes open
And keep hopin'

[Chorus]
Just a dreamer
Shoutout to the sky, comin' from a believer
Wishin' upon a star to be my savior
People tryin' run my life
Tellin' me to stop dreaming
I need to get away, beautiful escape

[Break]
Just me, myself & I
Beautiful escape
Just me myself & I
Beautiful escape

[Interlude]
This is forever, forever, ever
This is forever, forever, ever, ever

[Verse 3: Classified]
Yeah, I dream to get away
From the heartache of yesterday
The marijuana always medicates
But there's got to be a better way
No excuses, this is all me
Takes the bumps and bruises I find it therapeutic
I'm shooting for the stars on a quest through the galaxy
Trying to escape from the stress of reality
I'm out

[Chorus]
Just a dreamer
Shoutout to the sky, comin' from a believer
Wishin' upon a shooting star
Just a dreamer
Shoutout to the sky, comin' from a believer
Wishin' upon a shooting star to be my savior
People tryin' run my life
Tellin' me to stop dreaming
I need to get away, beautiful escape

[Break]
Beautiful escape
Beautiful escape
Beautiful escape
Beautiful escape
Beautiful escape
Beautiful escape


[Outro]
This is forever, forever, ever
This is forever, forever, ever, ever
This is forever, forever, ever
This is forever, forever, ever, ever
