[Intro]
Tik-Tok, Tik-Tok, Tik-Tok, Tik-Tok
Tik-Tok, Tik-Tok, Tik-Tok, Tik-Tok
Tik-Tok, Tik-Tok, Tik-Tok, Tik-Tok
Tik-Tok, Tik-Tok, Tik-Tok, Tik-Tok

[Hook]
People press pause, when they've got no cause
Gangs throwing signs up, kid your times's up
People press pause, when they've got no cause
Gangs throwing signs up, kid your times's up
Tik-Tok, kid your time's up
Tik-Tok, kid your time's up

[Verse 1]
See my head is now laid back
You come with style but yo, you getting paid fat
Not me, I'm gonna have to let this ride
I'm know as Classified, laid back from '95
'96 mixtapes, coming through the door today
This is how I'm coming, this kid has just been something, man
Called forward by the kings of the round table
To weep, or not to weep, that's another fable
Now you won't match me with the skills on the microphone
I'm just an amateur because I've got no manager
I used to have a crew but now we just all good friends
I'm back to the start, yep dude's be all alone again
I never stay down, I gotta get back on my feet
I grab a mic and raise my head and then I start to speak
Tell you what is on my mind when I get the chance
Ain't got no moves but yo it's funky like the humpty dance
Humpty hump, the fans are getting drunk
Take a sip of my rhyme and try to walk in straight lines
You can't do it like you used to cause you've killed your mind
You can't do it like you used to cause you're out of time

[Hook]
People press pause, when they've got no cause
Gangs throwing signs up, kid your times's up
People press pause, when they've got no cause
Gangs throwing signs up, kid your times's up
Tik-Tok, kid your time's up
Tik-Tok, kid your time's up

[Verse 2]
Now put the drop back in, if you want the night to begin
Here comes the darkness, I guess I gotta spark this
I'm shooting rhymes with my mouth, but never with a gun
Cause it wouldn't be real cause if I told you that I had one
I'm just a fist swinging emcee, now people trying to get me
But suckers can't sweat me
I'll let it roll off my neck, and down my back bone
Or even catch it through a live stage microphone
I'm down with everybody and who want to beat me
I'll grab a microphone so no one can defeat me
My name is Luke, still your putting up your duke
Now put them back down clown, I'm just joking around
I'm just a joker if you haven't realized yet
I talk to people around the world like the internet
A.K.A it's coming live from computer screens
And Jedi knight is here with his light-saber beams
Lighting up stages, music paper pages
I'm lighting up the room, enlighten up the room
People say "Class, have you made your mind up?"
No time to answer cause now all my time's up

[Hook]
People press pause, when they've got no cause
Gangs throwing signs up, kid your times's up
People press pause, when they've got no cause
Gangs throwing signs up, kid your times's up

[Verse 3]
I bring my static, coming out the attic
You suckers can't stay mad cause I'm coming so dramatic (whoa)
I got myself together like disease to a healthy man
And now I'm coming cleaner than a bump to a wealthy man
Shazam, you lost your human gullet
You end up looking really silly like a chumpy man
You out of style like plain white-T denim
With Jay in my life, I'll be with more than John Lennon
Not likely, but I got  to have a dream
Mic's got the moon walks so I got the tunes here
I give it up to the people who deserve it
But never giving props to the people who deserved it
I got my own luck, but my rhymes busted
Remember the name because you still can't touch this
Stop this trick, I'm living on a solo tip
I lived my own style since I was a small child
I got the quickness, people trying to kick this
Now you catch my rhyme flow like you catch a sickness

[Hook]
People press pause, when they've got no cause
Gangs throwing signs up, kid your times's up
People press pause, when they've got no cause
Gangs throwing signs up, kid your times's up
People press pause, when they've got no cause
Gangs throwing signs up, kid your times's up
People press pause, when they've got no cause
Gangs throwing signs up, kid your times's up

[Outro]
You, you, you, you don't stop
You, you, you don't stop
You, you, you, you don't stop
You, you, you don't stop
You, you, you, you don't stop
You, you, you don't stop
You, you, you, you don't stop
You, you, you don't stop
