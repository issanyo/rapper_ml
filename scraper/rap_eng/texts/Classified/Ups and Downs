[Verse 1: Classified]

Damn another migraine, visions blurred eyes strained
I need another gel cap ‘cause once this headache hits it’s a short trip to hell and back
I got too much on my mind
The lifestyle I lead got my health on decline
I ain’t as quick thinking as I once was
I guess that’s what smoking J'S and blunts does
Even my free style is getting worse
I’m losing it, can’t connect the missing words
And everybody wanna get a verse
But when I say I got no time that get the feelings hurt
Daddy, hey what’s up baby girl?
You’re the only thing that make sense in this crazy world
Through all the madness and the sickness, I know that I can look to you for love and forgiveness
What’s your mama doing, oh she’s cooking dinner
Daddy gotta write the song, go on and cook with her
I’ll be in soon, soon as I get finish
And tell your mama get the laundry done and do the dishes
But who we kidding can’t even do that right
I mean I can but my mind stuck on half life
I’m trying to find somebody I could pass the mic Who got the drive, that will make the same sacrifice I did
Yeah I signed a couple guys but I guess I didn’t do my job
At least in they're eyes
I wasted too much time and some dope beats
But it’s back to the grind, same old me
The suns shining again, satisfaction, oh Canada IT just went platinum
I’m hitting plateaus I never thought my rap flow would hit
And actually make a real cash flow off this shit
Last year I felt like I was everywhere
They even heard me from Regis and Kelly's chair
The Olympics the Juno's I did it, all of this
All from one song I’ll admit it
Am I a one hit wonder?, I don’t think I am
But the thought crossed my mind then I erased it And for the video we asked everybody out
No black people show, then they called me racist
Maestro told me: "Stay off the message boards Classy"
Well I’m sick of all these rap geeks talking out their ass cheeks
Hanging off every word, class speaks, but anyway that’s last week
This week yo I’m about to move out, I just bought a couple acres
And built a new house, shit it feels good to be doing what I love
And knows who hate fuck you, I earn what I got
I used to think that money changes a man
Now I’m thinking that it changes those around you
A lot of people wanna hang on, and drown you
So I gotta watch the people who surround Luke
I know who my friends are, it'll reflect in my memoirs
Life is a trip, a joy and challenges
I just got to learn to live it and balance it
