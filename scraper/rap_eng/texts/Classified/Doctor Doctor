"Paging Mr. Myles, we are ready to see you"

Please help me?

I went to the doctor
Guess what he told me?
He said I was sick of being so lonely
He said I was tired of being so blue
And I said doctor, doctor, doctor, can't you tell me something new

He said your heart is beating so weak
That even with my stethoscope I barely hear it beat
I want to hear bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop
But it’s so quiet now, I can almost hear a pin drop

Wait and you will see
Things are even worse than they first appear to be
She broke my heart in two
I had nowhere else to go so I came to you
I had nowhere else to go so I came to you

Doctor, Doctor, please report to emergency

Please help me…wo, wo…..stand up, never gonna understand
Wo, wo…..stand up, never gonna understand

He saw the tears dried on my face
He took some notes then he put me in my place
He said, son, you're a boy, not a man’
And there's still some things that you've gotta understand

Only love can break your heart
Only love can make it start
To beat, beat, beat

I went to the doctor
Guess what he told me?
He said I was sick of being so lonely
He said I was tired of being so blue (in blue)
And I said doctor, doctor, doctor, can't you tell me something new?

He said wait and you will see
But things are even worse than they first appear to be
She broke my heart in two
I had nowhere else to go so I came to you
I had nowhere else to go so I came to you

"Paging Mr. Myles.  We are ready to see you."

Only love can break your heart
