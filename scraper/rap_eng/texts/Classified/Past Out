(Yawn)
2 o'clock woke up
Breath smelling awful like somebody throwed up
Bodies on the side of me, passed out or sleeping
Lungs full of smoke, make it hard for me breathing
Got no shirt, freezing, liquor bottles everywhere
Half filled with matches, floor filled with ashes
Spilled glasses, of vodka, bacardi
Now I'm trying to think, man what happen at this party
All I can remember was White Michael spitting
Mark Mirage spinning and Short Shane was drunk
Rest of it was blurry and kind of slip my mind
Now I'm feeling out of touch like I'm two steps behind
So I step through the house with my eyes wide open
Paste in my mouth from the hydro I 'm smoking
Knucklehead strolls in, ask what I'm doing
Rolls up a joint with this left over Cuban
Blazed that and kept moving, started going upstairs
Winded and couldn't make it up there
It's real pathetic if you wanna think about it
But I was smoking weed cause I can't drink without it

Chorus, (2 times)
First, first, let me introduce this, ha
Half out my brain trying to do this, nah
Trying to figure what's going on
My mind won't respond, can't tell right from wrong

And as I finally made it to the 2nd floor
Out of breath still unsure what I'm checking for
Rooms are emptied like somebody just robbed em
But what do I care this ain't my place, ain't my problem
So I continued walking, bumped into klepto
Taking off with someone's Nintendo
And I seen Nath Cruise take booze
From these fake dudes, shaking in they boots trying to play cool
Laughed about it, then made my way downstairs
Made a drink and took another look around there
3 o'clock their ain't nothing going down here
Now I'm trying to think why I'm still standing around here
Forget it, I'm done, grab my coat and pager
Flipped off the neighbor in a pissed off behavior
Went straight to my house, I wish I stayed sober
Cause last night I was drunk, now I got these crazy hang over
Man, everyday goes the same
As I run through these motions again and again
Had a lot on my brain and finally said @#%$ it
Couldn't of been a great night, I already forgot it!

Chorus (2 times)
First, first, let me introduce this, ha
Half out my brain trying to do this, nah
Trying to figure what's going on
My mind won't respond, can't tell right from wrong
