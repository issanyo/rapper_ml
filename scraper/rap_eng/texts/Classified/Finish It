[Intro]
Oh now look at what we started
Oh now look at what we started
Finish it

[Chorus]
Yeah, got a job to do (finish it)
Got a problem with who? (finish it)
Wanna run the race (finish it)
You gon' run with Chase (finish it)
Oh now pass that J right here, lemme finish it
I got goals to get, I'm tryna finish it
Take the pass from Gretzky to Curry and some finished shit
I'm bout to finish this
I got 'em

[Verse 1]
Woke up in the place with nothing on my mind
'Cept getting this job done
Don't get in my face talking all of this mess
Don't test little boy, I'm the wrong one
Got a whole lot of people with a whole lot of problems
And they going full throttle till the cops come
Don't stop til we finish it spending from the Guinness
But we living for the minute 'cause we are one
Wanna start some shit? Better finish it
I push it to the limit even when I'm scrimmaging
When I'm going for the gold I'm gonna bring the medal home
I ain't here for a participant certificate
When I'm watching porn I don't finish it
'Cause I always cum before I finish it
And no girl don't be acting like you innocent
Getting a little intimate, use a little stimulant
Look, I don't set no deadlines, no, I set goals
Don't cut corners bro we Greco
It's fair to warn ya we past the threshold
And we go where we go so fuck your dress code

[Bridge]
Put them in they place, they don't need to ask; they all know the outcome
Waiting on the wimp, ain't no way I'm gonna get this job done
I ain't slowing up, said it from the start oh boy I'ma finish it
Said you wanna leave, then you got a drink oh girl better finish it

[Verse 2]
Look, I ain't, running with the fakes and the snakes
And the people hanging on like dead beats (no)
I'm trying to excel you'd rather keep me in a box like spreadsheets
Put the burner in high man, cooking up a storm
But we still keep it raw like red meat
Gotta swim from the pores, bed ridden indoors
Time to change up your drawers and your bed sheet
Yeah, I tried Walking Dead but didn't finish it
Then I started game of thrones couldn't stop till I finished it
I work a job with no pension
The benefits like some roulette table and I'm spinning it
There's a method to my madness
The progress always outweighs the damage
I came in the game with a slight disadvantage
But man you should take my music 'round the planet
I don't do things proper I'm not at all bothered
I'm not what you fathered, I'm not
Always try to do it with honour I put food in my daughter's
Yeah I do what I gotta, fuck off

[Chorus]
Yeah, got a job to do (finish it)
Got a problem with who? (finish it)
Wanna run the race (finish it)
You gon' run with Chase (finish it)
Oh now pass that J right here, lemme finish it
I got goals to get, I'm tryna finish it
Take the pass from Gretzky to Curry and some finished shit
I'm bout to finish this
I got 'em

[Bridge]
Put them in they place, they don't need to ask; they all know the outcome
Waiting on the wimp, ain't no way I'm gonna get this job done
I ain't slowing up, said it from the start oh boy I'ma finish it
Said you wanna leave, then you got a drink oh girl better finish it

[Outro]
Oh no look at what we started
Oh no look at what we started
Oh no look at what we started
Oh no look at what we started
Finish it (x3)
