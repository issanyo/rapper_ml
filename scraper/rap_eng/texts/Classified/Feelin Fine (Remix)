[Jordan Croucher]
I, oh I'm, feelin fine
(I'm alright, alright, alright)
And I, oh I'm doin fine
(said I'm feelin fine)
Yes I am, oh ya

Now this is how the story all goes down
Give up the hoops, now I'm in the street round
Got in the booth just to lay the shit down
And let the world know about this sound
And I never ran, never will
Put in the work just to pay my bills
And everyday I struggle hard just to find
What Ive been lookin for all my life

[Classified]
With all the madness in the world, I'm chillin and feelin fine
I'm buildin these instumentals, and kill them with brillient rhymes
It's hard to get ahead cuz we live in resiliant times
Where chill work is sellin knives, we got to be buildin minds
Oh, mr. serious, I guess I'll always feel inclined
Surround myself, only workin with the realist kind
Jordan hold it down, let the people know the deal
Comin from the Maritimes, so tell them how we feel

[Jordan Croucher]
I, oh I'm feelin fine
(I said I'm feeling fine)
Do you feel it, can you feel it
And I, oh I'm doin fine
Yes I am, oh ya
I know its hard to make it in the business
But I'm a tryin til they say I'm missing
And if it never works out, I'm straight
I'm doin fine either way, its ok
And I, know my wrongs and the rights
Do everything to get the best of this life
And I'm a take it one day at a time
And keep striving always to survive

[Jay Bizzy]
I'm feelin great, this beat reminds me of a summer breeze
And I can't wait to get you home to have some fun with me
If you ever feelin lonely, and you need some company
Girl, you know that I'll be down in a minute
Then we can handle business, I wanna lay this jam, its almost finished
JC and Classified, together like the Jackson 5
Too busy and the mix, of course you know the track is that
We got the bongo, sing along, y'all know how this song goes

[Jordan Croucher]
And I, oh I'm feelin fine
Yes I am
And I, oh I'm doin fine
Yes I am, oh ya
Now that we're comin to the end of this song
I gotta let you know I'll always stand strong
Because the lessons that I learned at home
My momma told me, 'baby hold your own'
And I appreciate the love you gave
Becuase it taught me how to walk this way
Talk this way, never be afraid
And I...
I (I said I, I I)
Oh I'm, I'm feelin fine
Feelin fine, yes I am
Yes I am, I said yes I am
I (I said I, I I)
Oh I'm, I'm doin fine
Doin fine, yes I am
Yes I am, oh ya
