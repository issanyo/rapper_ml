Yeah, i know never took it serious
But then what we had got fucked up
We grew along but in my heart i still love ya
Back at the start i thought it last so long
Went by so fast, now it feels like the passion is gone
Everything i loved about you just got pissed away
And it really gets to me cause i miss them days
You was modest, honest, pretty much a goddess
The farthest thing from bitchy or heartless
You never thought less of a jobless pothead
And even though i couldn't get you cards or chocolate
You put up with my nonsence day after day
You were one of the type you don't let get away
Shit we used to looped together
I remember the time you was so sick, we almost puked together
Your mood was better than
But who would've knew what we had we would soon lose forever
Damn, i still love ya

You left, you were like my sunshine you were to young for love but i knew you'd be mine had to let you go and move on with my life now i got you back ain't no leaving this time and i know i can always rely and i know you'll be keeping me high now i won't let you go cause i know i learned my lesson. I know i can't take it serious i gotta know if your feeling us, this time of love ain't hard to find but i know your always on my mind. I know i can't take it serious cause i know that your feeling us, this time of love ain't hard to find but i know your always on my mind

Yeah, i'm going through the same thing right now man
I gotta say something on this one
Okay, yeah, i know
I said wouldn't do it, but i did it
And now i got me wishin the position was switchin
Never no hugs, no tounge, never kissin
But keep fuckin with it since the first day i hit it
The minute that talked i would listen
You made the way that i walk a little different
I like your vibe, like the way the that you feel
You had style from the start, now you payin my bills
I gotta love it, yeah i'm a little obsessed
And i confess without you i feel a little depressed
The wifes had it, sick of giving you my attention
Really, i see her point, but it was never my intention
I'm always talking and bringing you up
Like yo, check this, is she amazing or what
And the phatter that you get, the better, i can't complain
The mistress in my life, music before the fame
I love it
