(Oh Canada we stand on guard, for thee)
I told this guy where I was from
He said oh, Canada
Kinda laughs it off, real funny huh?
Yeah, uh, come on
(O Canada)
1-2, 1-2
Mic check, 1-2, 1-2
Yeah
(O Canada)
Uh, yea
From the land of the lost
Trans-Canada crossed
Patriotic in a honda
With a hand on my heart
From the Greatest of Lakes
To the greenest of greens
To the Rockiest mountains
And everything in between
O-o-o Canada
Oh you're no fan of us?
'cause our movie and TV shows are so amateur?
Yeah, we laugh it off, that don't really bother me
Look, we ain't serious unless we really gotta be
Humorous attitude like Kids in the Hall
Like Jim Carey, Mike Myers, hell we claiming them all
It's the Great White North
Home of the funniest actors
The brunt of the joke
With an abundance of laughter
The Red and White flag
Keep it high keep it visual
People say Canada and get stereotypical
Think we finish every sentence with buddy or bye
And if it ain't that its either dude, eh or guy
(Canadaka eh)
Yeah we consider it people
And smoking marijuana
We consider it legal
Still doing rap like the 1990's
But that's how we like it off timed and grimey
I know where I'm from and I told ya before
North of America hard to ignore
Every time I go away I tell them for sure
I'm from Canada o-o-o Canada
(O Canada)
O Canada o-o-o Canada
(O canada)
I'm from Canada
O-o-o Canada
The Class makes a sick beat, we call it a classic (x4)
I've been around the globe and
Heard the confusion
Honestly a lot of y'all are ignorant and stupid
Yes, we have microwaves, tvs and cell phones
Unintelligent fuck we invented the telephone
We made Yahtzee
The light bulb, hockey
And bred the greatest player's Gretzky to Crosby
We all got at least one drinking buddy
And after one drink, all of us think we're funny
Our national mascot's a damn beaver
O Canada we love our beaver
Home of Hell's Angels the RCMP
Home of Gordon Lightfoot and SCTV
The Underground Rail Road
Georges St. Pierre
Right here is where he calls home
Our health care system
Y'all know its free
Keep our girls banging with a full mouth of teeth
I won't even get into the music on the streets
They say hip hop is dead
Naw its up north with me
I could do this all day its a part of my routine
But supper's almost done and tonight poutine
I know where I'm from and I told ya before
North of America hard to ignore
Every time I go away i tell em for sure
I'm from Canada o-o-o Canada
(I'm from the east coast of Canada)
O-o-o Canada
(I'm from the east east east coast)
Yo yo!
See I'm from Canada so sometimes the words come out of my mouth like this
Get used to it
(O Canada, we stand on guard for thee)
