[Chorus]
I told you I'm not waiting on the wall
You look way too good to leave this up to luck
And I don't want your heart
Your soul
Or your hand
I want your body (want your body) instead
(Now, now, now, now)
Take your clothes off

[Verse 1]
I've been on your case
Plotting on the ways I can make you mine (mine, mine)
Hardly goes a day
Hardly goes away
It must be right (right, right)
Open up your door
What are you doing?
We're wasting time
I can see you
Looking at me (looking at me)
Is it all in my mind (mind, mind)

[Chorus]
I told you I'm not waiting on the wall
You look way too good to leave this up to luck
And I don't want your heart
Your soul
Or your hand
I want your body (want your body) instead
(Now, now, now, now)
Take your clothes off
Take your clothes off

[Verse 2:]
Got me in a hold
Everything is moving slow
Time disappears
Wasting to a stop by
You can read my thoughts
When you're near
Nothing is the same
As it was before you got here
Oh oooh, tell 'em not to wake me up
It's all in my mind (mind, mind)

[Chorus]
I told you I'm not waiting on the wall
You look way too good to leave this up to luck
And I don't want your heart
Your soul
Or your hand
I want your body (want your body) instead
(Now, now, now, now)
Take your clothes off
Take your clothes off

[Bridge]
No fallin falling for you
No fallin falling for you
Tell me what you
Tell me, what do you want?
Why are you taking so long?
Why are you taking so long?
Why are you taking so long?

[Outro]
'Cause I told you I'm not waiting on the wall
You look way too good to leave this up to luck
And I don't want your heart
Your soul
Or your hand
I want your body (want your body) instead
(Now, now, now, now)
Take your clothes off
Take your clothes off
