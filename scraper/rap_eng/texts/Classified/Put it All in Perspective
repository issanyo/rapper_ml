[Intro - Classified - talking] - w/ ad libs
Come on
Yeah
Listen

[Verse 1 - Classified]
MC's don't sleep, wake up (wake up!) check the schedule
Class on the mic, turn me up another decibel
Some think I make money, book me for a festival
Some think I'm dope and they put me on a pedestal (haha)
Some say I'm cocky though and tell me that my head is full
But I don't need 'em though, cause that's what real friends are for
And I don't know you man, sorry my attention's short
You shouldn't pay attention to a stupid message board
I take it all for what it's worth, you can rest assure (yeah)
And I don't fall for stupid shit like sex with whores
I'm on the road to rock shows and get paid (yep)
I play hard to get, so I'm hard to get played
I stay out the clubs, cause I don't need the static (nope)
It's hot enough in here, so I stay out of the attic (yeah)
I don't rap with rappers, so all y'all fuck off
You ain't scarin nothin, so drop all the tough talk

[Chorus - Classified] - 2X - w/ ad libs
I got somethin to say, so let me get into it
No time for wastin, I ain't tryin to be a nuisance
No way, I'm tryin to make a point, so respect it
(I'm holdin it down and put it all in perspective)

[Verse 2 - Classified]
Yeah, and when my tongue twist, I run this dumb shit
Hit hard like drum sticks on drum kits, pump this
Play this in the streets for the heads, or the club for the drunk chicks (yeah)
Beats bang, plus I spit 'til my gums split
You might of knew me from the +Hey Now+ song
And I dropped +Maritimes+, not a played out song
But the real heads know this, Class is the man
While these fake heads think I'm a flash in the pan (listen)
I was spittin before you existed
Shit kid, I was enlisted before you showed interest
Before you knew how to use FruityLoops
Or had a clue on Mastered Beats and the Rubik's Cube too (ha)
I don't handle biz when I'm smokin my green (nope)
You call when I'm high, then you get my machine (yeah)
It ain't personal kid, it's just how I do it
So don't interrupt when I'm tryin to do my music

[Chorus - Classified] - w/ ad libs
I got somethin to say, so let me get into it
No time for wastin, I ain't tryin to be a nuisance
No way, I'm tryin to make a point, so respect it
(I'm holdin it down and put it all in perspective) - 5X

[Verse 3 - Classified]
And I was raised by my parents to speak with manners
Growin up fairytale like believin in Santa
Got excited over small things like treats from grandma
Same thing now except it's weed from the manager
I love Mary Jane, shit I think it's awesome
It's weird how pot heads like to brag about their problems (yeah)
Now I got people tryin to say I do coke
Well I never put a motherfuckin thing in my nose, okay?
Do you but it's not for me
Fuck it's all I got, I keep my nostrils clean
You could quit with the gossip, the talkin and all that
Worry about yourself, not me, now fall back

[Chorus - Classified] - w/ ad libs
I got somethin to say, so let me get into it
No time for wastin, I ain't tryin to be a nuisance
No way, I'm tryin to make a point, so respect it
(I'm holdin it down and put it all in perspective)

I got somethin to say, so let me get into it
No time for wastin, I ain't tryin to be a nuisance
No way, I'm tryin to make a point, so respect it
(I'm holdin it down and put it all in perspective) - 5X
