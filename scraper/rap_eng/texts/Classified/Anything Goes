[Verse 1: Classified]
Look and behold my mojo's outta control
Back at it I'm no joke going for gold
I've been around put it down all over the globe
Still the Nova Scotian in me comes outta my mouth
The East Coast, my accent is evident
No neglecting it I represents my residents
East Coast, and I don't hang with anyone whose selfish
Pass the weed I can smell it
I'm heavyweight attitude like Chevy Chase
I'm over 30 its too late for you to set me straight
I don't ball, I ball hockey
I'm what you call cocky, Bob Marley meets Paul Coffey
People wake up, top of the morn'
I've been a motherfucker way before my daughter was born
Turn the clocks back and check the locks on your door
Because it ain't safe outside no more when

[Bridge]
Anything goes
I got the world in my palm
Lights camera action its on
I can't describe what I'm feeling
Ain't never felt this freedom
Anything goes
I got the world in my palm
Lights camera action its on
Ain't never felt this freedom
Could you say that

[Hook]
Anything goes, anything goes
Anything goes
Anything goes, anything goes
Anything goes

[Verse 2: Classified]
I ain't on the same schedule as most
My demeanor and my timing is a little off beat
Whether its rhymes or the marketing schemes or the beats
Best believe everything its all me
I'm on stage free-styling off the head
Got the crowd reaching up trying to grab me like the walking dead
I love Hip-Hop but fuck rap
Y'all can suck a dick and lick the nut sack to the butt-crack
(People get up)
Life's a journey not a destination
People go and try to burn me with no hesitation
Can't change, you can only change me
I ain't losing any sleep we ain't in the same league
Fans ain't buying albums anymore, cause everyone's trying to make singles
Stop trying to pop over night like a pringle
I built a foundation, a real fan base
Anything goes

[Verse 3: Classified]
It don't take much convincing to coax and to rope in
These hoes when coke's in the nose and
Girls acting like morons, face covered in makeup
Putting more on and more on
Maybe its a fact that I'm a father to a daughter
But a lot of these broads act real fucking dumb
Don't get it wrong I enjoy having fun
But I know not to burn when I'm taking in the sun
Check the metaphors
I don't contaminate the reservoir
I stay pure over thinking till my head is sore
I see what I see I know what I know
But Yo, somethings got to give when anything goes

[Bridge]
