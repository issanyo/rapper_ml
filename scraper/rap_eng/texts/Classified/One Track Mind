[Hook - Joel Plaskett]
One track mind, focused on important shit
Eyes on the prize, one track mind
One track mind, focused on important shit
Eyes on the prize, one track mind

[Classified - talking over Hook]
Ye-yeah, you got a
Haha, yeah
Yo, I got a little story for ya

[Verse 1 - Classified]
Yeah, now Dave he works hard in the dock yard (ha)
But wants to be a rock star, drivin hot cars (yeah)
Livin large, gettin girls like an all-star (right)
Filthy rich knockin hits out the ball park (come on)
With his Les Paul Guitar as his call card
He fell in love with the music, it was all heart
And when you reach high sometimes you fall far (yeah)
You gotta give it all you got once the job starts
Focused everyday, smilin when he played
His fingerprints took a beatin, almost fade away
His family didn't know or couldn't understand
They thought he'd snap out of this like a rubber band
But we know he seems (gone) got his first taste
A couple show dates always comin home late
At the break of (dawn), his girl's sleepin
Barely ever see him cause he's giggin on the weekend
And when he was around it was like his mind wasn't
His girl would talk to him but he never heard nothin
Mind always racin, a race against time
That's a one track mind

[Hook - Joel Plaskett] - w/ ad libs
One track mind, focused on important shit
Eyes on the prize, one track mind

Got a one track mind, I'm focused on important shit
Give me some time, I only need a little bit
Got a one track mind now, I'm focused on focusin
I'm hittin my stride and everybody's noticin

[Classified - talking over first part of the Hook]
Haha, yeah
I can see it

(Ohhh, now look it here)

[Verse 2 - Classified]
And Brooke is like the girl that we all know (ALL KNOW)
Dressed to impress like a model (MODEL)
Only wore clothes with a brand name (bling)
She never shopped Target, she had a bad aim
She got her hair and nails did almost everyday (yeah)
Said she liked the attention that it sent her way
And when she's done up right she likes everybody noticin (woo woo)
Looks for the praise lets the compliments soak in
But on a bad day and by a bad day, I mean a bad hair day
Or don't know what to wear day
She doesn't go out, don't feel comfortable
Without the accessories, she don't feel presentable
Huh, she always worry what she look like
She thinks everybody worries what she looks like
Her own man sick and tired, so he took flight
She knows he loved her but he couldn't deal with Brooke's type
She thought appearance was the only thing important
Left everything else on the back burner boilin
Eyes on the prize, focused on the goal line
That's a one track mind

[Hook - Joel Plaskett]
One track mind (hey, hey), focused on important shit (ha)
Eyes on the prize, one track mind
One track mind, focused on important shit
Eyes on the prize, one track mind

I got a one track mind, I'm focused on important shit
Give me some time, I only need a little bit
Got a one track mind, I'm focused on focusin
I'm hittin my stride and everybody's noticin

[Classified - talking over first part of the Hook]
Ye-yeah, you got a one track mind
