[Verse 1 - Classified]
It Goes..
Welcome to Danger Bay
Where everybody acts up in the strangest ways
In this place when it pours it rains for days
Ain't no love left only the hate remains
Walk with me, escape or face the flames
Type of place you don't know your neighbors name
And in Danger Bay, there ain't no hereos
Nah, they only wanna kill them and be the villain like scarecrow
It's a place where the athletes and entertainers
Are more valued then the doctors and educators
And they all lost faith in their lord
And the ones who haven't they don't go to church, they go to war
It's a place where the wicked are rewarded, and money in the power's too important
The skies turning grey and the ocean turned black, I think we in too far and we can't turn back
Welcome to danger bay!

Ooh ohh ohhhhh
(Don't wanna go back, I don't wanna go back)
Welcome To Danger Bay
How will You survive through the fires and the winds of change?
Welcome To Danger Bay
You better change directions or count your blessings

[Verse 2 - Classified]
You ever been to a place like this? Where they have no shame and they show no sorrow?
You ever been to a place like this? Where to laugh at another man's pain is normal?
It's hard to believe what it used to be
A beautiful scene for the human being
Then they started pollutin the streets
Abusing the land and love grew in to greed
And the earthquakes rumbled and the gods rained down
As the winds and the hurricanes blew from the sea
The buildings crumbled and the fires spread while
The wild tornadoes uprooted the trees
So much hate, so little love
Is it the apocalypse we in the middle of?
Will this world burn? Freeze? Or will it flood?
Shit I don't know I'm trying to stay afloat in Danger Bay
