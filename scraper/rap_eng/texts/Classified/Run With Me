Back on my day shift, I got my tools and my lunch box
I'm on my grind, full time, but I never punch clocks
I'm more than muscles, not a dumb jock, no tough talk
But I could wipe you cum wads up with just one sock
That's right
Ok you said I never had a chance
But I keep proving that this shit is not an accident
Traffic jammed, I've had it man, smashing through like batter rams
Always stay connected like my data plan
I calm your nerves like Lorazepam
Magic man, mesmerizing like my lava lamp
But I could snap like elastic bands
And I can be a real prick like a cactus plant
Now bring it back again
I got you flocking like the Vatican
Pack em'in, turn the music up and let me rattle em'

[Hook: x2]
Run Run Run
Run for the hills and try
Try to run with me
Try to take a run at me
I, I run the beat
Still you wanna front on me
But I don't think so, no, I-I don't think so

If ya know what's good for ya, then put your mic down
Ya keep on swimming with the sharks then you might drown
I know you talk a lot of shit you need to pipe down
And I mean right now
And if you know what's good for ya better watch ya mouth
Cause you don't know what you talkin' bout
Eh yo, my parents always told me you can't recycle garbage
But as an artist you proving that's far fetched
And you the hardest... to listen to, trash man
So say good bye to your career jazz hands
Yea, I'm a titty and an ass man
At the cheapest strip club getting a lap dance
Masked man, boner in my track pants
Disappearing in the dark night like I'm batman
Back to my cave in the early morn
Looking run down like those chicks off of Jersey Shore
Dog tired, body all hurt and sore
Please have mercy lord, pick me off the dirty floor
And pick a path we gone run till we collapse
Get the people on their feet and get the haters off their ass

[Hook:]
Run Run Run
Run for the hills and try
Try to run with me
Try to take a run at me
I, I run the beat
Still you wanna front on me
But I don't think so, no, I-I don't think so

Now don't be mad at my cocky behavior
Or the bragging and boasting it's my competitive nature
I'm an mc
I'm suppose to act like I'm the illest
And I know I ain't the best but I'm comfortable where my skill is
And that makes me the realest be honest, plus
No ones fucking with my catalog of concepts
When it comes to live shows and beats, I'm the complete
Package
Ready for some action now dig in get some traction and

[Hook: x2]
Run Run Run
Run for the hills and try
Try to run with me
Try to take a run at me
I, I run the beat
Still you wanna front on me
But I don't think so, no, I-I don't think so

If ya know what's good for ya, then put your mic down
Ya keep on swimming with the sharks then you might down
I know you talk a lot of shit you need to pipe down
And I mean right now
And if you know what's good for ya better watch ya mouth
Cause you don't know what you talkin bout
