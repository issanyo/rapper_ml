Yeah [Verse 1 - Classified] They might say I lead a simple life, the type that don't excite And yes I like to smoke more than light 'til night I realize I got a problem, I'm high way too often And only seem to acknowledge it after I indulge in it Pull in my driveway, walk through my front door Then make a bowl of cereal to conquer my hunger See I like to eat before I slumber Brushin my teeth and gettin clean, helps me to find my comfort Jump in my bed and turn the TV back on I feel like I was just here, the day don't ever last long I feel like everyday's a cycle, I've learned to accept it There's a lot of scenes to see, I need to learn to direct it I turn the TV off and start brainstormin Try to figure what I'm gonna do in the mornin I know what it brings, I wonder what's in store though I wonder what the hell I'm gonna do for tomorrow (do for tomorrow ...) [Male Narrator's Voice] Goodnight, we'll see you tomorrow
