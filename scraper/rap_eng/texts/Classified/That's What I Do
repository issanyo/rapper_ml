[Intro]
(That’s what I do)
Yeah, uh
Feelin' kinda famous, yeah
(That’s what I do)

[Verse 1]
I'm feelin' kinda famous in my hometown
People hold me up, cause I hold em down
I never moved away from my family
And got the same friends since elementary
You know the name and the style
But don't know what I have
Cause in my circle of friends
The ones who posted and bragged
Ended up insecure, jealous of what others had
Glad I got raised a little different by my mother and dad
You know what I mean? (That’s what I do)
I was a skater and a jock
Always showing off
My rolemodels were Wayne Gretzky and Tony Hawk
A C student I was average at best
Till I found hip hop and put my attidude to check
Then I found my identity, stopped caring about what anybody said to me
Alot of people make music to make you go forget about life
I make mine to hopefully help you out and deal with it right
That's what I do!

[Hook]
(You know it’s all been done before)
(That’s what I do)
(You know it’s all been done before)
(that’s what I did)
How many times I got to tell ya
(that’s what I did)
I'm doin' this with or without cha
(That’s what I do)
I went through all of it and back again
(That’s what I do)
That's what I do, no need to ask again
(that’s what I did)

[Verse 2]
And I ain’t playing by the books I don’t know how
I write my own story as it goes down
And you can either love me or hate me
No one cares about the ones who play it safely
Even my manager parties more than I do
I usually leave the party by 2
Go get high and hit the drive through
I feelin' kinda old for this shit
But the kid inside of me don't know when to quit
Huh, I bring the weed to the party cause of courteous
I started burnin' it, cause I was curious
Now marijuana is my reality
But never touch a harder stuff cause my addictive personality
I know my limits, what I can and what I can't do
I understand myself so I don’t underhand my health
It’s Sheer determination and true grit face it
Don't follow any path blaze it!
That's what I do!

[Hook]
(You know it’s all been done before)
(That’s what I do)
(You know it’s all been done before)
(that’s what I did)
How many times I got to tell ya
(that’s what I did)
I'm doin' this with or without cha
(That’s what I do)
I went through all of it and back again
(That’s what I do)
That's what I do, no need to ask again

[Verse 2]
Yeah and it's true (that’s what I did)
I'm thinkin' about this music every day and night
I'm just passionate about the way I write
But every now and then I need to take a break from this
Cause I can't even raise my kid or take a shit
Without attempted to create a hit
My lifestyle ain't change since 19
And I'm still at the liquorstore gettin' ID
With the same crew
J-Brew, IV and Mike B
Us losing touch highly unlikely
Ask the wrong person I’ma has-been and done with
Ask the right person I’m a legend who runs shit
You either gonna love this or dump this
But all I can do is keep it 100
That's what I did!

[Hook]
How many times I got to tell ya
(that’s what I did)
I'm doin' this with or without cha
(That’s what I do)
I went through all of it and back again
(That’s what I do)
That's what I do, no need to ask again
(that’s what I did)

[Outro]
We know it’s all been done before
That’s what I do
We know it’s all been done before
That’s what I did

That’s what I do
That’s what I do
That’s what I do
