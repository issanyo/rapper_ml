[Intro]
I don't know what it is, I'm falling (falling, falling, falling)
I don't get up, I don't get up, I don't get up
Get get up, get up, get up

[Chorus]
The hurt in me, brings out the hurt in you
But I don't want no one else
And no other hurt will lose (I'm falling)
The hurt in you, brings out the hurt in me
But I don't want no one else
I don't want no one else

[Post-Chorus]
I don't know what it is, I'm falling
I don't know what it is
I don't know what it is, I'm falling
I don't know what it is

[Verse 1]
Life is moving fast paced
Got me running through this rat race
No one wants to come in last place
So we hustle and we hashtag
Life has got no backspace
But it's precious like a glass vase
It's hard to understand what's going on
We live in a confused place
Half the world starving and the rest are tryna lose weight
We just wanna make it to tomorrow
Hoping that our mortgages hold up and never foreclose
But they say with every door close, another one opens
I ain't sure what's coming for me, and ain't sure where I'm going
But it's never too late to correct it, when you feeling neglected
Thinking the likes on your picture is my contestant
Finding success doesn't mean you're rich
It means you found your happiness
So baby, slow it down yeah, I know it now
It might take some time to come around
But hold it down 'til the sun is out
Come on

[Chorus]
The hurt in me, brings out the hurt in you
But I don't want no one else
And no other hurt will lose (I'm falling)
The hurt in you, brings out the hurt in me
But I don't want no one else
I don't want no one else

[Post-Chorus]
I don't know what it is, I'm falling
I don't know what it is
I don't know what it is, I'm falling
I don't know what it is

[Verse 2]
I know it feels so frustrating, saturated like you can't make it
We try to motivate ourselves with memes and catch phrases
And try to stimulate ourself with all these backpages
Hold the world up on our shoulder with no back braces
Don't make permanent decisions for temporary feelings
We all have our demons but got different methods of dealing
Sometimes you only need some time to start the healing
Finding success is such a grey line
We used to talk face to face, now we talk face to Facetime
Lately all I see is more race, gay and hate crimes
Report it live on my Twitter and from Dateline
I feel desensitized and hate it
Everybody in the bar lining up like Soul Train
Best pick up line in the club now is cocaine
We working so hard to keep our head above the water
But life comes around, don't let it make you drown
Just hold on

[Chorus]
The hurt in me, brings out the hurt in you
But I don't want no one else
And no other hurt will lose (I'm falling)
The hurt in you, brings out the hurt in me
But I don't want no one else
I don't want no one else

[Post-Chorus]
I don't know what it is, I'm falling
I don't know what it is
I don't know what it is, I'm falling
I don't know what it is

[Outro]
I don't know what it is, I'm falling
I don't know what it is
I don't know what it is, I'm falling
I don't know what it is
