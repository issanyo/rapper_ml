[INTRO]

(Memories in the corner of my mind, flashbacks I was laughing all the time) x3
You're getting older
The glass is half full or half empty

[Verse 1]

I turn the page on my calendar
Oh how the months fly
Another day passed, another sunrise
Another cloudy day feels like I'm out of shape
Worn down, out of place, choked up and tongue tied
The weather's getting colder
The furnace doesn't heat me it's harsh growing older
My grandmothers both passed
And the year before last, my grandfather never woke up from his nap
I used to hang around with my crew everyday
Now, we might have a drink like every other week
Life changes in a blink
Shit, my eyelids are sore
I still can't believe my aunt and uncle got divorced
Got me feeling nauseous
Too many times I almost lost it
Gotta stay responsible but I feel exhausted
And when my man Shane Jackson died
He had my eyes leaking like the kitchen faucet
I'm drained out
I wish I never had to grow up
The baggage is too heavy for anybody to hold up
I used to never have a care in the world
And it changed, and I thought am I prepared for this world?
I don't know

[Hook]

Just let it go, let it go now
Just let it go, let it go now
And you will learn how to run
And you will always be
The one who found your way, young
The sun that made the day, young
And you will walk away
Number one, one, one, run, run...

[Verse 2]

Every night we lay to rest
So every morning is a rebirth
I walked so many paths that my ankles and my feet hurt
I was always hands on, always wanted to be first
I'm glad I've grown strong and did my research
They try to tell me things get better with time
And every morning is a new day, open your blinds
I always think about the yesterdays
And the things I used to stress and be depressed about
I'm glad I axed 'em out
I'm glad I've grown
It's good to be alive
Enjoy it cause when the wind blows the years breeze by
These lines on my face and bags under my eyes
A proof that I've been living and experienced a life
I know I lost some old friends and my grandmothers' gone
But I made more new friends and my daughter was born
Everything I got excited about that grew old
I get more joy watching her experience unfold
I've seen it all
The fakeness, the greatness
I'm smarter, I'm sharper, I'm confident and patient
I'm more at peace and comfortable with my identity
A lot of shit I went through as a kid can stay a memory
Let it be

[Hook]

Another cloudy day feels like I'm out of shape

Just let it go, let it go now...
