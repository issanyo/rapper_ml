(*sample of "hmmmmm, makes me frown" repeated throughout song*)

[Intro - Classified - talking]
Yeah
Let me talk to the women for a second
You see, I know what I got and I know it don't get much better than that
But the same time, sometimes I see these girls and I'm like "damn!"
You know?
And back in the day, they never really paid me much attention
But I guess what they say is true
You're taken, you're a lot more tempting
Ha, listen, yeah

[Verse 1 - Classified]
A love a girl when she smilin but somehow it make me frown
Mentally it kind of break me down
See I always keep it real, that's how I shape my sound
So when the wife hear the track she might hate me now
This ain't what you're used to, it's a sure rebuttal
It's a score to settle, maybe more than trouble
As a kid girls told me I was border level
Now they feelin me and tell me I'm a gorgeous fellow?
Wow, I appreciate that, thank you very much
You look really good too but I ain't supposed to touch
I told you before Class ain't the sappy type
But it's a fact of life, got to keep a happy wife
And I ain't perfect (nope), there ain't a man who is
It's just sometimes I think I need a chance to live
And my girl isn't stupid, she knows what's up
With these hoes and sluts at all my shows and stuff
Dancin on the dance floor, tryin to show their stuff
Another girl, front row tryin to hold my nuts
But I'm a man, so I glance and I soak it up
But if I take it any further though, I know I'm fucked
It's like "damn!"

[Chorus - Classified]
You know what I mean?
I see these girls on the street like "damn!"
We're goin to the mall, right?
I saw a girl on the bus like "damn!"
Ha and on tour, I see these girls on the road like "damn!"
I can't do a damn thing
I got to look past 'cause I'm starin at my ring

[Classified talking behind Chorus]
Yo, look at her
Yo, check her out
Yo, you see that girl? You see that? Oh man
Damn! Yo man, look at the ass on that girl, oh

[Break - Classified - talking over sample]
Yeah, ha, feels good
Most of the time, things that feel good, you ain't supposed to do
Ha, like I said I ain't perfect
But I'm tryin to be, ha
Yeah

[Verse 2 - Classified]
Yeah, now I don't usually write tracks about dealin with chicks
Except for +What's Real+ and that's as real as it gets
I just write about life and how I'm dealin with it
I don't decide what to spit on how appealin it is (nope)
I ain't the guy with the girl half naked in his video
Tryin to give a half ass titty show
Don't need a dick tease clothed on my TV
I watch 'em ass naked on the internet to relieve me
A love a girl with some curve and shape
Lookin innocent but freaky and would burn a J
I see girls on the streets and I wonder "what if?"
Then I lose all control and think with my dick
Think about sexin, sweatin, switch positions
Then I think about my girl and if we switched positions
And she was wearin my shoes and had the same chance
I know I couldn't take it, see her touch another man
I got to keep it true, in between me and you
Made a promise to each other and I'm tryin to see it through, girl
It's hard though, shit I can't lie
'Cause a lot of beautiful women are catchin my eye
It's like "damn!"

[Chorus - Classified]
Ha, yeah, I seen this girl at the beach like "damn!"
When we go to the club, right?
I seen these girls there, I was like "damn!"
Yeah, I see these girls all the time like "damn!"
I can't do a damn thing
I got to look past 'cause I'm starin at my ring

[Classified talking behind Chorus]
Yo, who is that girl right there man, who is that?
Oh my God!
Who's that chick dancin?
Yeah, the one up front

[Outro - Classified - talking over sample]
Yeah, ha, there's a lot of beautiful women around
I can look, right?
You know, I'm tryin to keep it as real as possible with my girl
As much as that means these days
You know? Huh
I just hope she understands me
Then again, she is the only one who understands me
Yeah, ha, ha
