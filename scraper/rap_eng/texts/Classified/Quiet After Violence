Well I would have been dead
If I hadn’t have said
That I needed more time
Getting used to this line of work
I work so hard, I work so hard, I work so hard
So I stayed there all night on Saturday
Would have been all alone home anyway
I was alright, I was alright
Til I woke up Sunday morning
No one driving, no one phoning me
To tell me what was wrong, what was wrong
I knew something was wrong
By the city’s silence
There’s always quiet after violence

(Can you hear it?  Cause I can’t hear it…)

I will admit I was scared
I wasn’t fully prepared
To see what lay around the corner
Didn’t know if it was only a daydream or a nightmare
What would I see when I went there
I didn’t know, I didn’t know, I didn’t know
Til I woke up Sunday morning
No one driving, no one phoning me
To tell me what was wrong, what was wrong, what was wrong
I knew something was wrong
By the city’s silence
There’s always quiet after violence

(Can you hear it? Cause I can’t hear it….)

Is this the first of the last
Is this my future or my past
Is this the first day or the last day of my life
Is this the first of the last
Is this my future or my past
Is this the first day or the last day of my life

(Can you hear it? Cause I can’t hear it…….)
