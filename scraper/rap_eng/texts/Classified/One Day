[Verse One]
Now Claaassss
Went From Underrated, Now Anticipated
Barely made it, Felt Degraded
Now I Can't Be Faded, Graduated
Rappers Hate It
Step Decapitated
But I Don't Give A Shit
Lookin' Back Dues I Paid It
I Got A Million Notches Under My Belt
From Droppin So Much Weight
Lookin' In The Eyes Of Many
And Never Could Relate
I Guess I gotta grow fatter
(Droppin') Chapter After Chapter
(And) And If I'm Hearin' Laughter
(Oohh Nooo) End Of [?]
And After The Ball Drops I'll Haul Off And Tap Ya
Step After Step You Respect Like A Master
The Sick Rhyming Bastard
Metaphors And Punch Lines
Lookin' For Some Sunshine
Feelin' Like I'm Done fine
Hands Have Calluses, Dealin' With analysis
From Start To The Ending Beginning To A Legend
From Class To My Enemies And All Of You In-Between
Hold The Tight Grip On Life If You Know What I Mean
Cause in one day

[Hook] {x2}
(One Day) You Can Be At The Top And Then Uh
(One Day) You Could Easily Drop But Then Uh
(One Day) You Got A Ride That's Large
And Then Another Day Passes And I'm Stealin Your Car

[Verse Two]
I Went From Unemployed To Gettin' Paid In One Day
I Went From Havin No Fun To Gettin Laid In One Day
I Went And Took Your Girls Virginity In One Long Day
A Lot Of Things Can Easily Change In Only One Day
I Went From Verbal Energizer To Lyric Memorizer
Kid Who Broke It Down By Syllables And Analyzed Ya
Kamikaze Type Of Flowin' Like A Mortar
The One Who Keeps His Head Up And Still Releases Product
Class/Unpredictable
Dealin' With The Back ? that's unforgettable
Unconditional Amounts Of Pain Runnin Through My Brain
Through My Veins, Feelin' Stressed Out, Both Are Unexplained
The Simple Life Is What We Need In This World
But Yo The Simple Life Ain't What We Got In This World
So I'm Gonna Take What I Got, Fade Away The Pain
I Know I Ain't The Worst Off But All Of That Could Change

"That's The Way The World Turns I Guess"
"Day After Day One Time After Another"
"That's The Way The World Turns I Guess"
"Now What"

I Gotta Raise Up And Gotta Cover Assets On Long Term
Taking Wrong Turns Show These People I respond Firm
Making Song Burn, My Voice Box Can't Take It
Feeling Like I'm Out of place, Naked And Shakin'
I'm Breakin' A Sweat
And Can't Do Nothin About It
I'm Feelin' Crowded, Can't Concentrate Can't Think Straight
Shit I Think I'm Flippin Out Don't Know What Am I 'sposed To Do
It's Just A Scenario But It Could Happen To You
In one day

[Hook]
