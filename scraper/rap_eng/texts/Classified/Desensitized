[Intro - Classified]
To fully enjoy this recording do not, I repeat do not
Listen to it on your laptop, cellphone, or any place without bass

[Hook - Classified]
I need to here that (boom, boom) Turn it up
(boom, boom) Turn it up
(boom, boom) yeeaaa, I need to here that
(boom, boom) Turn it up
(boom, boom) Turn it up

[Verse 1 - Classified]
I've been desensitized, Ive been exposed to the truth and the lies
Reality's part of our demise, look to the sky hands up like "why"
My eyes keep burning as I watch time fly
Everyday growing up was so sci fi, nothin seemed real now I say bye bye
To the dreams and the fairy tales damn I tried, wish I paid no mind
Oh Oh my my, my lord, my god, I am a little odd, I am off the wall
Old school, yes y'all, used to get excited seeing girls in their bra
Now I'm still soft till I get em out their drawers, awhh, back then I never saw
Any imperfections or flaws on these broads, naah, I feel spoiled gotta pause
Slow down I think I've seen it all I've been desensitized

[Hook - Classified]
I need something I can feel, everything around me used to overwhelm me
Think I've seen it all need to find another grail, everything I see
I gotta feel to believe, I'm desensitized

I've been at the same club way too long (yeah)
And I don't know what drink I'm on
One, two, three shots, four
Doesn't really hit me no more

I've been at the same
I've been, I've been at the same club way, way too long
And I don't know what drink I'm on
Yea, yea, but drink on, drink on, but drink on, drink on
Drink on

[Verse 2]
I need to be re-energized, back to the basics
No beginners guide, from my inner child
Never needed internet, no Wi-Fi
I've seen enough porn keep that window minimized
When I was a young guy I would chase your daughter
Never had no honor, 'cept when I was on her
Now I'm in the real world, dealin with the monsters
Going international, Canada is conquered
Man someone turn the T.V. down
Shit so real, stereo, HD surround
I've seen the movies, T.V.s and news clips
Never killed a man, but I know how to do it
It takes a whole lot to shock me now
I've been through the deep waters and the rocky grounds
Now I need the enticement and in need of enlightment
Guess I'm overlooking the excitement, I'm desensitized

[Verse 3]
Now if there's one thing I love about being Classified
It's: getting free shit and not having to buy it
I'm getting used to the smiles and the kindness
Never thought I would fit in this environment
Back then I was my own worst enemy
Now I'm getting used to this life, a celebrity
Used to have a hard time handling the spotlight
But now I'm numb to it all like frost bite
So repetitive, I feel like I've been injected with
The anaesthetic now it's slowly setting in
I'm drifting off and I wanna rest my eyes
Cause now a days nothing's a surprise, I'm desensitized
