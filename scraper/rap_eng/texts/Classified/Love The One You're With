[Hook]
Well there's a rose
In a fisted glove
And the eagle flies with the dove
And if you can't be with the one you love
Come on, love the one you're with
Love the one you're with

[Verse 1 - Mic Boyd]
All I can do is watch as friends move out west
Thinking to myself, wondering who goes next
Kinda makes me feel like every day I lose a step
I feel trapped and I gotta chew through the net
Now, life moves on, I ain't getting any younger
My high school friends all marrying their lovers
My ex got a baby and she's carrying another
While I'm still living with my mother, whatever
One by one we separate, yeah we seen better days
Had some great times and the memories never fade
But now it's time to move on and get that new job
And be happy for the friends that found true love
But by losing some friends I think I gained some
You see, I remember where I really came from
And it's the people that have been there from day one
It's called family, can't no one replace 'em (Thanks, son!)
I guess I been missing the meaning
It's like I've been gone without ever leaving and now I finally see it
Disappeared for what seemed like ten light-years
Searching for love, but the whole time it's been right here

[Bridge]
If you're down and confused
And you don't remember who you're back-talking to
Your concentration slips away
Because we're drifting
So far away

[Hook]

[Verse 2 - Classified]
Yo, I've been told your friends are the family you choose
The family you don't appreciate until you lose
Excuse the attitude, I don't mean to kill the mood
Fuck it, I'm doing Luke, you do what's real for you
I been growing up, you can say I live and learn
My friends show me love and I give it in return
A lot of things changed, though, ever since I came home
Enfield isn't all sunshine and rainbows
See, after high school I never would have called it
Who would have went broke and who woulda made a profit
Who would get a job and who woulda went to college
Who became the potheads and who's the alcoholics
I never lost friends, I lost acquaintances
Time passes, it could cost a relationship
So don't be wasting it, soon it could all just end
These are the good old days, there's some more, take 'em in

[Hook]
