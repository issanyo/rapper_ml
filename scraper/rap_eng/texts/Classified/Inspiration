I made this beat, 2003ish
Wrote to it but never got it completed
I love the feel love the vibe that I acquired
Spit a couple lines but wasn't really inspired
See inspiration is the thing that keep my brain ticking
If you don't feel inspired, something in my veins missing
I wasn't too strong
Quit that and moved on, never looked back
And started working on a new song
But as a beat-maker, you never know
A track that I ain't feeling might inspire someone else's flow
I sell beats, internet and in the streets
Helping poets paint pictures, I'm the canvas so to speak
I sold this beat to a guy named Phil
He reached out as a fan, hit me on my email
Told me I inspired him, he loved what I was doing
He said I motivated him to start pursuing music
Gave him the instrumental, call me when you done writing
But I never heard back and really never thought twice
It happens often, rappers never finish nothing
So it didn't seem strange he didn't hit me back with something
A couple months passed, that was fine
Then I got another message with Phil's name in the subject line
"Class, I'm a friend of Phil's from back in the day
And the music you made, inspired him in many ways
He changed his life around, got it on track
I want you to know, cause last week Phil died in a car crash"
What??? you serious?
I barely knew the guy but shit it hit me fairly quick
We all forget how much life should be admired
Sometimes we all forget how our music does inspire
Inspired Phil? nah, Phil inspired me
To finish up my song over top of Phillip's beat
