Oh another one of those songs huh?
Yeah, Beautiful day

[Hook]
I smoke my weed, I love my weed
I eat my weed, Its Sickening
I smoke my weed, I love my weed
I sleep with my weed, Its Sickening

This is Your, This is your song
Yes I'm telling the world theres no living without you
It'd be wrong, cause I wake up every morning thinkin about you

[Verse 1 - Classified] + (Mic B.)
Eh Yo Mic (yeah)
Remember back in the day
We never smoked weed, never rapping this way
We had so much energy, ambition to play
(Yeah, we was hitting the weights and trying to live everyday
To the fullest, Weed) was some bullshit
(To my peeps) we stole it
(Locked in the honda and rolled it
We Smoked out) No doubt, We got blazed
Remember that, I used your hat as the ash-tray
And that was the last day I'd ever be sober
Cause since then, life as I knew it was over
(Yeah me too, its so much better now
My visions clearer, but my eyes seem redder now
Its so great when I wake up and puke up a pile
Wipe my face with the towel, It's Sickening)
Eh yo, And sometimes I smoke so much my eyes close shut
I'm always hungry and I can't seem to eat enough *know what I mean*
Times is rough, a part of life is tough
But as soon as I'm waking up I'm in my room taking a puff *echo*

Ohhhhhhhh Good Morning World

[Hook]
This is Your, This is your song
Yes I'm telling the world theres no living without you
It'd be wrong, cause I wake up every morning thinkin about you

I smoke my weed, I love my weed
I eat my weed, Its Sickening
I smoke my weed, I love my weed
I sleep with my weed, Its Sickening

[Verse 2 - Classified] + (Mic B.)
Eh yo, now weed is not a bad thing, its a good thing
A neighbourhood thing, so much joy that it could bring
Kinda like the time your girl taught you a lesson
Dumped ya, you ended up on anti-depressants
(Yeah man I was stressing, ended up in the mental clinic
Doc said that I had to finish with the weed game and everything that's in it
But I didn't, So I'm livin in this world filled with misery
Weed seems to get to me!
Better leave and let it be
I can't believe I ever put that shit in me)

Mic B "Man that shit's nothing to me anymore"
Class "Wassup, wanna smoke this joint"
Mic B "Ahhhhh, I can't stay mad at you *puffing*"

[Verse 3 - Classified]
Eh Yo, One time I was at Curley's, the outback pub
We was smoking in the bathroom till the bouncer broke it up
Kicked me out for smoking dope and stopped (holy fuck)
Its just weed, its not like I'm throwing up, Oh Well
Now I'm in the parking lot waiting by myself
Hear my name get called in side, could win a trip down south
Thought to myself, I gotta quit this weed
But we all know class will be blazed by 3

[Hook]
This is Your, This is your song
Yes I'm telling the world theres no living without you
It'd be wrong, cause I wake up every morning thinkin about you

I smoke my weed, I love my weed
I eat my weed, Its Sickening
I smoke my weed, I love my weed
I sleep with my weed, Its Sickening

This is Your, This is your song
Yes I'm telling the world theres no living without you
It'd be wrong, cause I wake up every morning thinkin about you

It's Sickening
