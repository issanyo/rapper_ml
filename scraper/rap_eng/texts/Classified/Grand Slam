[Intro]
Pick it up, pick it up, yeah
Pick it up, pick it up
Pick it up, pick it up
Nah we ain't slowin' down, pick it up, pick it up

[Verse 1]
Yeah, let's play a game called the monkey in the middle
Married to the game, but I ain't scared to make a single
This right here got you feelin' like a nympho
About to climax, put your face all in the pillow
This that grand slam, home run
Early morning tee-off, sinkin' a hole-in-one
One for one, the underdog, but I'm winnin' it
Club closed but the DJ keep spinnin' it
Oh I can't stop this feelin' that I've come across
Moonwalkin' on water like the son of God
Then I'm ghost, bustas who you gonna call?
Feels like Christmas when I'm sippin' on that rum and all
This that bonus on your paycheck
It's when the wifey surprised you with day sex
Yeah, it's goin' on that first date
It's takin' her out for dinner and she offers to pay

[Hook]
That's a grand slam
Move the outfield way back, I'm swingin' for the fence
Grand slam
I got a couple of drinks, got weed and some money to spend
That's a grand slam
I'm feelin' brand new, like no I can't lose
That's a damn good day to me
That's a damn good day to me
And that's a damn good day to me
Pick it up, pick it up

[Verse 2]
Yeah, I'm tryna give a bit of great advice
You in a dark place, this could be your ray of light
It's that feeling that could make your night
I'm tryna take these people higher, it don't matter if you're 'fraid of heights
Right? Right. Right? It's like that back massage
It's a bachelor party for your last hoorah
It feels good, don't it? Good, don't it? Enjoy it while you can
Cause this all stops when the record ends
There's three types of people I know that tell the truth
Kids, drunks, and those with nothin' to lose
I'm on my last drink, though, but got no weed to smoke
Oh, just found a joint in the seat of my coach

[Hook]
That's a grand slam
Move the outfield way back, I'm swingin' for the fence
Grand slam
I got a couple of drinks, got weed and some money to spend
That's a grand slam
I'm feelin' brand new, like no I can't lose
And that's a damn good day to me
Said I'm feelin' brand new, like no I can't lose
And that's a damn good day to me
Grand slam
And that's a damn good day to me
Pick it up, pick it up
Nah, we ain't slowin' down
Pick it up, pick it up

[Verse 3]
I'm that tall, skinny white dude, born and raised
Out in Enfield is where I'm still livin' today
Nah I never went Hollywood, never for big
And a big up to my hometown for lettin' me live
I'm feelin' it and feelin' energized
Like I worked out and got some exercise
It's that game winning goal, it's getting home from work
It's smellin' your favorite meal cookin' on the kitchen stove
Hey sugar tits, I love to hit on women
But in a good way, I don't hit my women
You men are just absurd, this is justice served
They wanna just observe, you're gettin' just desert
This is gettin' sweet revenge on your worst enemies
It's partyin' all night 'til breakfast at Denny's

[Hook]
That's a grand slam
Move the outfield way back, I'm swingin' for the fence
Grand slam
I got a couple of drinks, got weed and some money to spend
That's a grand slam
And that's a damn good day to me
And that's a damn good day to me
Pick it up, pick it up
Move the outfield way back, I'm swingin' for the fence
Grand slam
I got a couple of drinks, got friends and some money to spend
That's a grand slam
You know I'm feelin' brand new, like no I can't lose
And that's a damn good day to me
And that's a damn good day to me
And that's a damn good day to me
