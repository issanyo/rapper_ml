[Hook]
(Shadrach, Shadrach)
(Say what you like, just spell my name right)
I've got a good name
(Say what you like, just spell my name right)
Yeah
(Say what you like, just spell my name right)
I represent more than my rap
(Say what you like, just spell my name right)

[Verse 1]
I got a good name
My first name came from a slave in Babylon
Back in the day, rat in a cage
Raised in chains he trained like Rocky
But I mean his brain, not boxing
So he got sly like Stallone, got game like 50 Cent posse
Up first to work, on his coffee grind
In no time promoted to the king’s right hand
But no hype man, had to take the right stand
When the king made a statue of gold
And told the whole nation that they had to bow down to it
That or get tossed in a furnace
Shad and his boys said, "Boss, you can burn us
We can’t serve this statue, it’s worthless"
The king was mad but Shadrach wasn’t nervous
It must’ve been some strange phenomenon
They walked straight through the fire: Chaka Khan
Saved by a faith stronger than flames
If I’m half as brave then I’ll honour my name
I got a good name

[Hook x2]

[Verse 2]
My last name’s come down some generations
Came down from an elevation high in the hills of a great nation
With a bright future and a dark past
That won’t overshadow the hope cause the night’s passed
Down from my grandfather who held down a village
Feel it when I touch down there
And now spilling in the same veins
As a good dad with a good name
You see, Shad’s pop always played bad cop
He had no badge though, we didn’t give him mad props
But now I respect it, I guess it’s perspective
In hindsight seeing it’s corrective
So when I get kids, if they get arrested
They gon’ get licks like breath mints, check it
He held a tough job down, held my mother’s hand
Handed down proud roots from my motherland
To my hometown
People say my name sound dope, no doubt
But that’s not why I’m most proud
I got a good name
