[Hook: ​Crowded House Sample]
Hey, hey now, hey now, don't dream it's over
Hey, hey now, hey now, don't dream it's over
Hey, hey now, hey now, don't dream it's over
Hey, hey now, hey now, don't

[Intro: Classified]
Huh, huh, huh.  Yes, yes.  What, what?  Classified.  Yo

[Verse 1: Classified]
Ayyo, I finally got the truth from ya.  A token B'll recognise (What?)
That Classified was never one to mess around with lies
It ain't my nature—total behavior be opposite
Droppin' it.  I be the dopest MC rockin' it
Composin' tracks, got your mind in a daze
And gotcha wonderin' how I can flip it every which way
Lots of practice.  Ayyo, Class brings tactics
That make you bounce around like you and your girl on the mattress
Son, I'll stop you in your track with your weak style
And you can speak foul, but can you really freak, pal?
Too many MCs on the mic sound the same
It's kinda funny, though, cause they're the ones that found the fame
So what's that say about this world and the music business?
I guess it's all about the bank and how much money's in it
And Half Life is like half broke
I gotta work the nine to five to put my own records out
It ain't a problem, yo.  Keeps me focused on the mic
And makes my skills tight.  It feels great to shed the light
So I'mma break it for the million MCs kickin' raps
That never seen no money, no fame, or no contract
Ayyo, you know most of us won't
See a million bucks—most of us will end up broke
To me, that ain't what it's about.  Yo, I live for it
Hip hop, what's the best you can give for it?

[Hook: ​Crowded House Sample]
Hey, hey now, hey now, don't dream it's over
Hey, hey now, hey now, don't dream it's over
Hey, hey now, hey now, don't dream it's over
Hey, hey now, hey now, don't

[Verse 2: Classified]
So what you take me for, son?  Another ten minute
Rapper, who's only in the game cause his friends in it
Blast ya with flows that leave your brain intoxicated
If duplicated, I'mma start this off uninstigated
So watch yourself or catch a lyric to that dome in seconds
I use my microphone to tear MCs apart in sections
I use my mind to amplify the situation needed
And put them all together when my destination meet it
And now I'm at this spot, fresh out, convinced that
It was never 'bout shocking this—all about rockin' it and droppin' it
From late at night to early morning
Rappers on the mic while DJs focus on their form and
Chain.  It's got my mental doing flips
You come into this game, think it's easy—y'all can't do this
So put the mic down, let an MC like me kick it
Flip it, rip it—that's how I hit it (Ha!)

[Hook: ​Crowded House Sample]
Hey, hey now, hey now, don't dream it's over
Hey, hey now, hey now, don't dream it's over
Hey, hey now, hey now, don't dream it's over
Hey, hey now, hey now, don't
