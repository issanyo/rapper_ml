[Chorus]
No I won't stay in today
I feel like I can touch the ceiling
And I'm going to do things my way, my way
But maybe that's over your head
(like a hoodie and a ball cap, I wear a hoodie and a ball cap) That's over your head
(like a hoodie and a ball cap, I wear a hoodie and a ball cap)

[Verse 1: Classified]
Uh
Eh yo my offensive is offensive, I'm clearing the benches
Class is back in session, I just broke out of detention
Don't need no body guard, nah no type of protection
I got a vasectomy so sexually I'm protected with no contraceptive, uh
Feel like I'm floating every night and day
And the price I pay for this life ain't no ice capade
And life'll change, thats the way it is
Used to rap to raise a roof now I rap to raise my kids
(Still) This music is important as waking up and getting Tim Horton's in the morning for Canadians
I always play to win
But I ain't compromising what I built in my native land just to make it in the states again
I'm running mad and I won't be no forgotten fad
Been doing this, I probably partied with your mom and dad
I got you giggling and jiggling, baby
I ain't single, I'm just mingling
Now bring in my lady, I do what I love

[Chorus]
No I won't stay in today
I feel like I can touch the ceiling
And I'm going to do things my way, my way
But maybe that's over your head
(Like a hoodie and a ball cap)
That's over your head
(I wear a hoodie and a ball cap)
That's over your head
(Like a hoodie and a ball cap)
That's over your head
(I wear a hoodie and a ball cap)

[Verse 2: Classified]
Eh yo I woke up Sunday morning on a park bench
Passed out as superman and woke up as Clark Kent
Last night I was swinging from the trees like I was Tarzan
I wanted Mary Jane, drift away to a far land
Uh, its now or never
They say good things never last forever
But instead of getting worse man, I keep on getting better
So they pirate my music like this shits a hidden treasure
Whatever, I'm just happy you can find it
Gotta keep my back against the wall so you bitches can't talk behind it
I do this with a purpose while you do this thing with no cause
I'm over your head like my ex-girl's blowjob
So keep on swinging on your wrecking ball
Yup, I don't give a F at all
Tough love got me pushing past the bases
Life is hit or miss like batting cages
I'm doing what I love

[Chorus]
No I won't stay in today
I feel like I can touch the ceiling
And I'm going to do things my way, my way
But maybe that's over your head
X2
(Like a hoodie and a ball cap)
That's over your head
(I wear a hoodie and a ball cap)
That's over your head
(Like a hoodie and a ball cap)
That's over your head
(I wear a hoodie and a ball cap)

[Verse 3: Classified (Samples)]
Said I go over your head like a hoody and a ball cap
I just wanna make sure that you followed that
I been eating good and I'm getting fat
Like Adele, I'm so full, of snacks
I'm just joking, I'm playing
Rapping and saying shit
Nowadays thats all you gotta say to get away with it
Look I'm a good look but I'm a bad dresser
I told you I would never change so I'm wearin' the same get up
Cause whether I'm getting groceries at the superstore, or 'bout to do a tour, or hosting the Juno awards, you know I
(I wear a hoodie and a ball cap, I-I-I wear a hoodie and a ball cap)
I said I go over your head like a hoody and a ball cap
(I wear a hoodie and a ball cap)

[Outro: Classified & Samples]
No I won't stay in today
I feel like I can touch the ceiling
And I'm going to do things my way, my way
But maybe that's over your head
