I don't need to see the bright lights on the top of the Eiffel Tower
I don't need to hear the bells chime on Big Ben at the top of the hour
I don't to see the Amazon flow into the sea
I don't need to see the highest building
Or the tallest tree

It don't matter
Cause you're not with me
It don’t matter
Cause you’re all I need

I don't want to feel the warm air
Somewhere down in California
I don't need to hear a whistling train
Or feel the rain, I should have told you
How I felt, how I feel right now
I wish I could turn back time some how

It don't matter (she gave me love that I never forgot)
It don't matter (she gave me love that I never forgot)
It don't matter (never forgot)
Cause you’re all I need

I don’t need to see the great wall, pyramids or coliseum
I don’t need to see the Mona Lisa, Starry Night in some museum
I don’t know how it fell apart
I just know your smile was like a work of art

Wishing we were kissing instead listing all these places
That I’m never gonna see until you're here with me
I’m wishing we were kissing instead listing all these places
That I’m never gonna see until you’re here with me

I don't need to see the bright lights on the top of the Eiffel Tower
I don't need to hear the bells chime on Big Ben at the top of the hour
I don't to see the Amazon flow into the sea
I don't need to see the highest building
Or the tallest tree

Cause it don't matter
Cause you're not with me
It don’t matter
Cause you’re all I need
And everywhere I look

You’re all I ever see
It don't matter (she gave me love that I never forgot)
It don't matter (she gave me love that I never forgot)
It don’t matter (I can’t stop)
Cause you’re not with me
And everywhere I look you’re all I ever see
