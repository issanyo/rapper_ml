[Intro: Mia Rae]
I've never loved someone like this before
I've never felt something and been so sure
Oh I feel it in my fingertips
I hoped for this, I hoped for this
Sorry for the eagerness
I run to this, I run to this

[Verse 1:]
He wasn't a lover, he was a fighter
She was something that he desired
Attempted to talk to her but
He couldn't ignite the fire
At first she wasn't that into him
And that was it, the years passed
Then she ran back into him
And they reminisced on their pasts
Time changes everything
They started talking, started relating, started dating
Then got naked, started the love making
Love is love
They rushed the club
This boy has never danced in his life but for this girl he'd cut a rug
Yeah things were good
But sometimes that boy would get jealous
He knew he was wrong but couldn't help it
And he knew he was selfish
Or maybe insecure
He knew she didn't like him at first
So every time she talked to other guys he thought she was a flirt
They fought a little, fought a lot, thought of breaking up
But never would let the day finish until they were done making up
Every treasure worth something is lost and then recovered
He ain't perfect, she ain't perfect but they're perfect for each other, its love

[Chorus: Mia Rae]
Say your mine
Love me tonight
Say that you will, say that you will, ssaaayy
I will love you, I will love you all my life

[Verse 2]
Now its been seven years and going strong
Holding on to the life they made
Hasn't been all easy street
Relationships have a price to pay
She had a nine to five job, a real career for work, and loved it, 'Till the boss tried to hit on her and have an affair with her
She stopped it quick
Said "No" and that was it
But then she never told her boy until weeks later, and he flipped
And he didn't know how to handle it
But got through it eventually
They could figure it out together but not a chance doing it separately
This boy was no saint though, made some bad choices
There was this other girl who hung around his boys, they'd flirt for enjoyment
Nothing serious, it was kinda pointless
But then they started talking on email
Like "I had a great time last weekend"
And his girl saw the emails
Obviously she started freaking
Like "Are you cheating? Tell me if you are right now or I'm fuckin leaving"
Never meant to make her suffer
And he knew that he only loved her
He ain't perfect, she ain't perfect but they're perfect for each other, its love

[Chorus: Mia Rae]
Say your mine
Love me tonight
Say that you will, say that you will, ssaaayy
I will love you, I will love you all my life

[Bridge: Mia Rae]
I've never loved someone like this before
I've never felt something and been so sure
Oh I feel it in my fingertips
I hoped for this, I hoped for this
Sorry for the eagerness
I run to this, I run to this

[Verse 3]
Now this boy and girl are married
They wake up together everyday
Life's good, but sometimes when it is, you take it for granted
They don't have too many problems
Picture perfect in many ways, but nowadays
He don't take her out for dancing and ain't romantic
She complains about little things
Like "Can't you keep this house clean?"
He thinks she just complains cause she's got nothing else to complain about
They don't fight too much but when they do
They don't always work it out
Cause they know they'll wake up together in the same bed, in the same house anyway
They're driving in awkward silence
Boy looking at her like "why ain't she talking, why is she crying?
What's she thinking about? Is she happy, is she doubting us?"
But they both know nothing's perfect
You gotta work if there's any hope for ya
Naw this ain't a love song its a real song
When you build a relationship theres obstacles and only the strong will build on
They built a family and now this girl's my baby's mother
It wasn't all fairy tales but were always there for each other
Thats love

[Chorus: Mia Rae]
Say your mine
Love me tonight
Say that you will, say that you will, ssaaayy
I will love you, I will love you all my life

[Outro: Mia Rae]
I've never loved someone like this before
I've never felt something and been so sure
Oh I feel it in my fingertips
I hoped for this, I hoped for this
Sorry for the eagerness
I run to this, I run to this
