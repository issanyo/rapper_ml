Intro:
We got no heroes wearing capes
Hoodies Get you zeroed
Skirts get you raped
Destruction is constructive
When the construct is destructive

Verse 1:
Siutations and stories
Are behind crime basics
People do only come
On a case by case basis
Preload prewrote laws
Like you're covering bases

Like if you dont spin em out
You'll forget that you're racist
Or the next fucker
Could easy replace it
With chaos like
The one size one you've created

In the lives of those
You claim arent case by cases
Cause you're justice unjust
And can't fucking face it
You'd rather send an armed idiot
To make it, taze it
Another life ruined by the system
Doesn't phaze it

Third of this countrys victim to slavery replacement
For profit prison system, potential erasing
Human traffickation makes for such honorable reason
For shoot first , ask questions too late, cops guns a blazen
Deflect guilt, unnerve, dont protect , serve treason
Blue clues IQs , pricks the size of bee stings

Chorus:
Its gang warfare its straight gang violence
Cops don't fight fair , its too late for silence x4

Verse 2:
They work for the people?
Shit! They have the people seazing
Hear a siren
People cause traffic wrecks freezing!
Breathe a sigh of relief at sight?

Nah, just try to keep breathing
See how the cops just fucking lie?
Kill Mike Brown
And make him the bad guy?
Eric Garner broke up a fucking fight
Never hurt a fly

So the cops took him out on sight
Investigated themselves and said they're right
In LA they murdered Ezell Ford
Believing in a good cop is getting hard
1 black man killed every 28 hours
Badges granting immunity powers

The cops only cause for existence
Is to back laws of resistance
To the poor getting its paws by insistence
On what the rich get and keep real wicked
Leave hungry in the streets and missions
Status quo or gauze for mittens
For trying to get any pittance

Chorus:
Its gang warfare its straight gang violence
Cops don't fight fair , its too late for silence x4

Verse 3:
Its time to fight back, thats what Huey said
Two shots in the dark, now Huey's dead
Its not white or black cause we all bleed red
What rots in the dark bring to light instead
What lacks in the facts lead to heads filled with lead, lots
So step out of the dark of ignorance bred and fed
If you wrack up the stacks of plaques for jacked tracks
With nothing real said
Then kick rocks
Cause you're just darkening the path laid ahead by the dead

Chorus:

Chorus:
Its gang warfare its straight gang violence
Cops don't fight fair , its too late for silence x4
