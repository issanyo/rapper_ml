Damage controls when image takes hold
Can't manage your load so the luggage u tow
Old adaged that holds but you just dont  know
The garbage that slows thinkin think u do
Cause  langauge of real things left untold
That abridged version rehersed and told

That imagined as ghosts allow them to grow
With ur package of what you feel owed and owe
Not knowledge, what you feel, reel from, n know
Or courage, how you deal, heal from, n grow
Holds hostage your appeal, steals your glow
A dosage of the realness tho

A passage thru the fake zeal u ho
The blockage that u self impose
That haulage that you need to peel fo
A flowage to really let flow
A drawbridge to your island alone
A linkage for those who mow

Through badshit so often go
Thru breakage but they neva break tho
The message of real will show
The outrage, thats got to go
Powa outagell kill you fasho
That hard edge is deadly yo

If you think damage u know of makes someone damaged
Ur showing urs , eveyones got damage just most haven't managed
Theirs and that makes them damagaed and dangerous
Oh yes 
Only some will go thru enough to have to come out reborn or come undone
Those damaged ones are least damaged of all
And if they are they know enough to let you know
Unlike those hidin damage from eyes even they own

That garbage tricky language you sow
That brokerage, finicky man, no
The milage you continue to up while know
U got leakage to what gasses you stowed
Manage your damage tho
Not a bandage for image or

The bondage self
That u don cuffed wrists and ankles
That homage will sink you slow
The college of lessons earn learning throw
Like carnage of one u killed outa window
But marriage not divorce is what thatll do

Not map page in the book you dont own
No fanage from happiness u block from
The fan page of you thats image more
Than biopic aged wisdom in pages self wrote
No passage from what u won't go through
No managing what you run from yo

Self admonish guilt will grow
Others admonish hate will brew
Both porridge link quick sand in only you
Re routage towards your own soul
It may cage the victimizer but thats you
No flotage on the sea when u anchors tow

If you think damage u know of makes someone damaged
Ur showing urs , eveyones got damage just most haven't managed
Theirs and that makes them damagaed and dangerous
Oh yes 
Only some will go thru enough to have to come out reborn or come undone
Those damaged ones are least damaged of all
And if they are they know enough to let you know
Unlike those hidin damage from eyes even they own

Theyre out, rage is in only hurts you
Even lashin out wagin war ull just go
Into ebbage and flowage of their highs and lows
And if they manage their perspective dude
All that damage you try to wreck them with goes
In the high pages of their story, the push to woah

No idea sage talent existed in you
Theyll thank you for the bad you did do
And youll rank with them cause they could grow
But you sank yourself under the same load
Evil acts forage on that shit n make u do
Worse things than you felt guilty for
Worse things than were did to you

And the more you do The more you hide
The more you dont know u can forgive inside
And all the pain will just go, smooth ride
The further on this road you go, self confined
The harder it is to go back home, gap grows wide
You get to the point you dont see what self deny
The good in you eradicted from your sight
No reason left to not just be
The worst person you arent but feel
You are now because you dont self see
And ironically it was all kept inside, within
To save those you hurt but won't confide in
