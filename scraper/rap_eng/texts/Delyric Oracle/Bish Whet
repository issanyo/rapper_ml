Intro
Well you is you
And I is me
Let a bitch breathe


Why are you so obsessed with me?
-

Verse one

1-2 checker
Microphone checker
Every night hone my skill
And I just gett betta
Bet i give u chills
Murderin beats, dexter

Always win, always will
Nutty oh u betcha
Jus like woody wood pecka
Brrr cold as ice
N my flows so nice
Dont be fooled by disguise

Cause heck ya ill wreckya
Powa supplies with my
Supa powas on the mic
Like name was electra
Intercept Hip Hops demise
From cowards who disrespect her

Bomdiggidy bars drop jaws like b girl airflare does
Baffled by this heat, my styles butter, b bust this
Battle ya bitch boy beat biter and BYS
Betta buyaka ur Ghost rider instead I guess
Bid bye bye to ya bread and butter,itd be best
Bamboozled, just canon fodder blast ya like KRS

Chorus
I got you thinking bout me like
B-b-bish whet
B-b-bish whet

I got you stressin bout me like
B-b-bish whet
B-b-bish whet

Meanwhile im just chillin guessin wonderin:
What? What bitch? Huh?
What?  What bitch? Huh?


Verse Two
Check it, I checked in, checked u
Checked right on out, thru
U set it up, set it off
Settled fast settled soft too
Dont get me wrong, harms not the intent
But when u wrong, go off n actin all mad

Im quiet all along, tryin not to laugh at it
Cause I dont even fucking remember you
I came in not caring (I dont start shit)
I went out not caring (I just finish it)
You too biggedy bothered to face me
And I can't be biggedy bothered to place you

Whats what you feel got to do with me?
Dont trip up tryin to cover up
What I shouldn't trip about
I won't, but thats cause
Imma trip you on my way out
You were a trip trip baby
But you trippin out
And im just out

Chorus
I got you thinking bout me like
B-b-bish whet
B-b-bish whet

I got you stressin bout me like
B-b-bish whet
B-b-bish whet

Meanwhile im just chillin guessin wonderin:
What? What bitch? Huh?
What?  What bitch? Huh?


Verse Three

Its causin you stress, ah ah baby
Hate that im blessed, na ah, ya see
Ive had it worse than the rest
Yup yup really
But I turn negative to positivity
No matta what ya throw at me

I catch it and make it mine
If I can't use it drop it
Leave it behind
U like me? Cool, lets chill
U dont, thats no big deal
Bitch dont owe you shit

If u have a problem get that fixed
No one has ever been created
That is intimidating nuff to get my hatred
I dont see anyone as a threat to me
So sweat it? pssh plees
What you think, believe and opine

Even if its dumb
Wrong and blind
Yo business, ur issues
Sure as fuck not mine
Not your therapist, tough luck
No bought time


Outro:
Oh you heard about it  ? I dont care. Why do you ? Why are you so obsessed with me?
