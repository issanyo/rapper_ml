Intro
Whoever said a barking dog dont ever bite
They never met a fuckin rapper in they life
In a fervor yap yap yappin day and night
Theyd rather jack another style thats tight
Cause they wik wik wack ya heard that right


Verse 1

All these scripted foes for the applause
All these insipid prose in ghostwrit bars
Flow with prose to flow with the flow of pros tiptoe at studio

Execs with checks check u trainwrecks
With checklists of yeses and nos

-
Studio got you on all foors, oh, no low blows?
Thot can't hear you on the floor, how low can u go?

Claim to ride-but your rider proved that was a lie
You riding on a writer back no freestyles

You ridin on a lotta dicks for free rides
Youll ride to get a deal, clothing, cars
-
Youll ride to get a meal, hoing course
Won't ride for any real fuckin cause

Guess your pride is worth the cost, never pried it loose it got tossed
Pack the pack, amass the mass, be pleased to please tha boss


Take pride in the pride as they take urs
Takin the lions share of the cheese of course


Rat rap traps got your neck snapped boo
As you fapped to snap backs and tatooes
As you napped on real Hip Hop cats
We rollin back through


Chorus:
Every producer claimin they make
What male rapper sayin that they
Doin to ur girlfriend in every way
And all fake thugs is claimin ta be
Banger Banger goin on repeat
Banger Banger gonna skeet
Bangrr Banger on the street
Banger Banger they full of sheed
Bang bang thinkin the culutres dead
Bang bang two to the vultures head
Banging banging for real Hip Hop
Bang bang It dont die and it won't stop




Verse 2

Hip Hop cats, tru school
Boom bap, g funk and conscious rap too
We lappin back with a whap like the clap of a strap
To smack that yap outya trap, wipe u off the map

Slap dem hacks stackin stacks wrack up
For wack tracks lackin facts as ya
Yip yapin yik yakkin clack clack(en)
Bout packs packin sacks never packed up
Part of the social contracts pact to act dumb
Mackin, baggin gals ya never bagged none

Braggin bout swag in fact u neva had bruh
Bangin, swangin, raps rep crips then throw piru

Clique swapper, Imposter, dick rider, who are u
Give props ta, claim parta any set that suits u
So kickback tracks can get kicked back plaques
That you jack from real rap cats who amass

With class what real rap is what real does best
Blast masteryll blast the rest this mess acts cast
Who mustve mastered bs, with that more is less
Real talkll surpass, outlast, last past this test
All you for-pap crap rap, hip pop saps gassed
To go nowhere fast but a crash n bust for cash

When ur day in the sun one hit wonder run is done
Won't be shunned just nonell remember u son
Those stacks of ones you said were hunsll be long gone spend on your what u sought to be tons on fun


If you need me to recap, that was a gift wrapped bitchslap
Wrap it up or we'll wetchu up, wrap you up, its a wrap

This is a call , I gotcha number , time to getup
Wake up, shake up, break up those who make up
Cats on the take, on the make, on a come up  takin culture bbrreakin, remakin it what they duna
Invert meaning, pervert seeing, subvert reason


Chorus:
Every producer claimin they make
What male rapper sayin that they
Doin to ur girlfriend in every way
And all fake thugs is claimin ta be
Banger Banger goin on repeat
Banger Banger gonna skeet
Bangrr Banger on the street
Banger Banger they full of sheed
Bang bang think our culutres dead
Bang bang two to the vultures head
Banging banging for real Hip Hop
Bang bang It dont die and it won't stop



Third verse/outro
That an mc was a respected thing to be then
Meant to be representations of the people, community
Now representatives of the coporations, powers that be
Got rid of all the substance that you knew
Outcasted past cats n cast actors to talk smack to you
Its a Trojan Horse usin respect Hip Hop amassed in you
By Seekin to speakin truth, leakin news theyd hide from view

Put in a Hip Hop fashioned box, called it new
Just plastic packaged bubble wrappin n air too
Hip pop, pop, pop love to distracted n comfort masses
Leaders flip flop flop cover up impacts cover asses
And our rights they rip right up fascist basterds
As police they clik clak uped their harassments

But sure keep yip yappin
