Intro
Some people just take evetything away
When a person who never sees cause only effect
Meets a person who sees cause as pause to reject
The former will be the latters human deathbed
Because they project and never reflect so subject
Themselves to eternal neglect of issues they erect

V1
They think blame , shame and that game they project
Solves it but its a temporary fix so they dont get it
Why they keep getting shit, theyll just see the effdct
They are the cause of in the one thry wrecked
And blame that instead, while the person they decked
Who knows too well , too much, other directon directs

Knows power in taking responsibility can't change them
Can change self in the end and so looks within
Gains strength, wisdom, insight from hurt and chagrin
But if two people are looking to place the buck
On the one least likely to be the one fucking up
Eventually there will be no more issues to remove

And you ll see what I came to, it never was you
Not maybe, a bit , it was true and now ur blue
From the freeze that stolen ignorance wanna tell u
Dont expect what you dont give cause u neglect to see its a choice we live
Everythings cause and effect if u elect to erect cause of affects whichre negative
And never check for punitive damages even when wreckage done is massive

Then you are headed for effects that you won't manage to ever pass them
Because to do that see gotta reflect, inspect feel , to responsibility be responsive
And if others pain u blindly or intentionally cause it ur the conventionally erosive
Of self as much as others as u blame and power from withins nonexistent reactive
To others, they own u so u r adrift, letting life steer u into a cliff rather than taking ownership

Hook
If you stay around those hot and cold too long
Youll be frozen in flames , eternally burnt to nothing
See too late u didn't belong
See too late u werent wrong
Now everything else is gone
Never knew solid ground so thought ud found
Stability on quicksands false promise to be round
Youll never get away emotionally, but swallowed all u r anyway
If you stay around those hot and cold too long
Youll be frozen in flames , eternally burnt to nothing

V2

Can't fix what can't see, can't undo what won't admit could be, can't self forgive
For what bindly blind self with as ur blind to blindness as ur perogative
But thats ur problem, mine is opposite, and only realized it late in this
Always took the mature big pic view of itm can't fix u, change u figured
So focused in to me and that got me self knowledge, removed haulage
Of enfused blockage and strength, wisdom but fuck it cause damage
Was done by those supposed gifts never blamed, always looked within
Every stressin potential blessin of wisdom and message to unmess me
But I wasn't messed up to begin with others put their baggage on me
And I didn't get it cause I had been free due to always having that mentality
Of positivity optimism in every trauma, problem, heartbreak adversity
But it allowes others to walk on me cause I didn't want to become others
And what theyd done to me didn't want it to repeat so went to far im the other
Direction, overcorrected thinking I was free falling but was on the right path
And now crashed into the rocks , that was the aftermath

Played best in what fired me up, cause it added fuel to fan the flame
My drive gassed up creation, inspiration, passion somethin insane
Only sparked when id get burnt, lighting my path, my own lane
Paind turn to strength, clarity, then a beautiful zen'd reign
In ego death; attachment, need, insecurity, fear melted away
Id get through anything, if I stayed on course now ablaze
Forward would always light the way to brighter days
Knew from all the pits been in before i cum thru anythin better than I came
Like a phoenix I flew too high for the fire I was under to do a thing
I couldn't bother with false friends, fights, their drama or games
So I cooled off to them and continued to feed off the heat that came
But now the roads iced off in every direction, can't go any way
I shoulda remembered that fire was not the thing to fear, nor bane
Its a beautiful part of life, that im now frozen to, can't feel if I strain
Numbed myself cold as the ice I put my feelings on to chill
Mustve been a thin slice cause they fell thru, and the numb is true pain

Everybody wishes they didn't care till they find themselves unable to care about anything
Everybody wishes they would no longer feel untill they are unable to feel a thing
Everybody wishes for strength which doesnt just require adversity to bring 
It also leaves you numb and wondering ....
Is self awareness, strength and wisdom gained from setting yourself free
By battling your demons, removing issues, insecurity, worries, greed, fear and need
Really worth what could easily become a casualty?
You won the insight of how to live and be
You see everything clearly in the light and everybody, you have power over yourself, control your destiny
But while your body
May survive the fight for all that to be
Your soul, self, ego may not have been so lucky
Then youre stuck with knowledge only good for those who still have what gaining that killed ...or froze

Dont wish to be numb, ironically I knew that the run to ignore pain would be dumb, so I chose to face it and feel it...maybe fear, sadness, happiness, anger, love and all those other states can burn themselves out if you let them rage wild for too long a time... burning so bright that like an ear can't hear the same loud, high pitch twice, when your emotions reach fever pitch theyll never fall or rise as low or as high as they did at that insane  height
I spent most of my life not only strongly
Feeling my feelings but trying to ignore
Feeling others feelings cause itd be an act of war
To tell someone of their own hidden but felt scar

If you stay around hot and cold too long youll be frozen in flames
If youre born of the fire again and again youll seek the same
Cause as much as you hate the pain , its the only real feeling
U try to changr ur fate but by the time u why and how seeing
And no longer would abate the burn , ure frozen in the flame
