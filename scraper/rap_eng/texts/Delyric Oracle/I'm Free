Intro:
I dont want to be anything
But right here in this moment
Im free , Im free
Living right here in this moment

Verse 1:
Its the epic
A new chapter
The ethical epochal
Hereafter
Diacritic for the anarchic
That her

Oratorical Oracle
Wise whys asker
Apostate by the fate
That you slate with your hate
Outlaw comin at ya raw
With more power than before

Not a crip or a blood, Im a one woman gang
Best not slip in the hole you dug, Ya'll cats can't hang
Well equipped with a poetic slug, Make ya feel the pain
Not ripped , but still a thug, This lady gone do her thang
Im not like these other hatin, fakin, faded rap cats see
Plagued by a haze of insecurity

Needed to be
So intimidated that you rate blindly
Miss me with that bullshit
You dealin with a REAL EMCEE
You better switch up that mentality
Or you'll bring out the femme fatale in me

Chorus
I dont want to be anything but right here in this moment
Im free , Im free
Living right here in this moment


Verse 2:
When it comes to love
Im headstrong
Cause I dont need it
Im full grown alone
If you think Id chase you
You dead wrong

Switch up on me I won't bitch or phone
Sorry my fallback game is just too damn strong
I dont need you , I want you
Theres a big difference
You won't impede me
Thats the wrong inference

I complete me, you adorn me 
Accessory
Or you can adjorn, be gone in an instant
No messin
Thats cute you think Id stress you
Points moot it dont address you

If you not down to ride when we commensed it
If you lied, I already sensed it
If you tried, you not convincin
Save your pride? You already fenced in
Your rearviews cracked from the blast
Were gettin chased by your past

Left in back, but caught up real fast
Now you trapped by what went down last
You think Id chase you huh?
Somebody got you gassed up
I think I'll take a pass hun
Even if you was the last one


Chorus
I dont want to be anything but right here in this moment
Im free , Im free Living right here in this moment


Verse 3:
See me, I dont ever lose
I live, love
Learn from what I been through
Suffer? Nah, just let that supply
The lessons I live my life by
That never suffice

And I never surmize or close my eyes
I survive and always thrive
Wherever I aim
Thats where I'll arrive
Never take a backseat on these winding roads less travelled of life
Always in my lane, and always drive

So here's some advice from me to you
Stop second guessing what you finna do
Limits? Test em, break ever rule
Cause heres a confession:
No one gives a fuck what you do but you
No ones watching your every move

They too busy hiding from view too
And when they judging then that means you doing you
And you'll have surpassed caring about a fool or two
You'll see how they do why they do what they do
They only hate cause they scared to be the loud proud few
You pushin buttons cause they wish they could live live too


So fuck em and just do what you do


Chorus
I dont want to be anything but right here in this moment
Im free , Im free Living right here in this moment
