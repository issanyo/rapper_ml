Intro
You can't phaze me bitch Im Krazy as Drayz
Think Kris and Pac: I just don't give a motherfuck
I fight with flow so sick, you'll need a midol when I'm done
But like my idol KRS-One, I may use words to herds incur to shun or stun or stunt
But should it occur and the fun be done;
Im also the one with the gun

Chorus:
I died in your arms tonight x8


Verse One

Yo, I got no insecurity
I got no fear in me
That makes me love all of humanity
But it makes me place no man above me
So I don't care bout laws you see
You really wanna fuck with me?

Cat got your tongue?
Gat not gonna get it done
Armed to the teeth
Put tongue and cheek
Where speech can't reach
If you don't practice what you preach
If you punish but never reach
If you leave what you bequeth
If you talk big, but roll thirty deep

I got you beat
And I'll put you six feet deep
Like Faustus had to face the heat
You gotta face the justice of the street
Can't hack it alone?
You jacked for your chrome?
Rims hocked for your gun
You talked about like you had one
But like your pride, you had none

Now your gold records you gotta pawn
To protect that mouth you run
Like the plaques you won
For kickback tracks for kicked back stacks
Gonna get kicked back fast
Part of that amassed mass shit I surpassed
To put you on blast


Chorus:
I died in your arms tonight x8


Verse Two

Connect the homage's dots
See no knowledge at your dock
Got weak flowage that got blocked up
This is drainage bitch back up
All you got is your fucking mock Glock
And you got that shit on safety lock
And you won't use it cause its all for shock

You saw self had to thank for this here Shawshank
Got gas to go inside the tank, blast past you
Outlast with class
Yeah, keep up that fast talk
Gonna put you in glass, huh

(bassi vibrati beatbox)
Lets recap as I unwrap what did in entrap
Flap your trap, "yap yap" youre so dap
"scary strap" "gonna slap"
That gap that you left Imma lap
With this NYC boom bap that I got on tap
While you fap to that cheddar mouse trap
Pop your bubble wrap sap scrap app rap crap off the map

Make a move on me , move outta my way or move on and move along
Cause I got no time for these tap dances and immature swan songs
Throw em up, put em up, put up or shut up, move along



Chorus:
I died in your arms tonight x8
