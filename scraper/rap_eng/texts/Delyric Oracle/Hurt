Never realized many typa numbs one can feel
From worst, "rather die/ too high a fee" typa deal
To best of your life cause its being free typa feel
That crazy nothin left numb is fun cause its real
Being depressed numb without feeling
Being restless numb which is fleeting
Being stressed numb which is fleeing
Beig.  -ng reckless numb which is freeing

Depressed, feel like fleeing, nothing. . u can't flee, can't feel for real, boring
Destressed, are fleeing, exciting, freeing, new numbness

There are many types of death
There are many types of life
A person, a soul, an ego, a role
Of freedom, lifestyle, a place u know
Days gone or phase uve outgrown
Or of a love of two souls as one
Seperating and moving on alon

V2
Then theres a type that combines them all
It takes a lot more to set that off
Than accident or disease to snuff
Its a life that throws you tough
Till you dont even notice nuffin
Thats when shoulda chose enough
But when u r accustomed to stuff
You stop realizing youve had it rough
Till something finally sets it off
Blaw everything you knew is over now child
Ready ur wiles to face the wild for a while

You have nothing to loose
Literally you will have to choose
Between making full use
Of this new

You want to cheer up? If youre down that bad?
Nah , im not teared up, not drowning in sad
You want to

Its worse than that
Ive lived thru murder, suicide, death of others
Ive legit been further inside hell, youd hide under covers
Ive been through it, heartbreak, betrayl, fucked up lovers
Whatd crush another, I used to uncover more luster
I used pain, sadness, anguish, seperation felt
From no main home always travelled, new continent
Always out of place , never had a safe space , shit
And any i created would be erdadicated in days theyd give
So i erased the need and freed myself in perspective
I took blessings not stressings from what I saw as lessons not messes
I took inspiration and motivation for creation from..
I took struggles not as troubles but ways to make muscles double
It got to where my response to the monster everyone fears
Pain, adversity, loss, despair, hurt, betrayl, embarassment, smears
Was excitment, dopamine and adrenaline flooded during even tears
In anticipation of what id done so many years
Put the bad to good, negative to positive, no cares

For a long time over what others said, thought, how I appeared
The more I learned about myself and how strong I was became clear
Those people were too far beneath me like a kid sweatin what an ant thought
Or a mathematician feeling self conscious over an equation cause that kid scoffed
People who were undeveloped enough to live tjeir life enough
Free of the insecurity and issued that makes the weak judge
