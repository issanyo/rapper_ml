Intro (hook):
I told you not to compete
But you stepped up
I told you not to compete
But you stepped up
But you stepped up to me
Yeah you stepped up
You b a
You stepped up

Verse One:
You can label me disgraceful
Well your fables be distasteful
You can't say I be unfaithful
It's all in where I place my faith though
Let you paint me as unstable
Unbridled unchained Bustin through the gate too
I may be out the bubble
I made me out the struggle
God made me out the rubble
Where they all been buggin
On what they been hatefully begrudging
Been gratefully just bumpin to my own chords
Never was just into one thing
But I'm always into something
No matter who where you is
Can't touch this
You a Judas ? You a brutus?
I ain't Caesar so let's do this
Ain't secret thought you knew this
Just too complex for you to view this
Can't see her
Figure her out
Rubix cube is
Your feeble and frail
Any feat never fail
I succeed superceed
Will prevail
No longer mortal
Invincible
Cause every morsel
Take in so
I morph me to my frame
Juice me like a morphie of pain
Morphing your hate into morphine
To my veins
More you give
The less I feel
The more I gain

(hook)

Verse Two:
Got a chip on my shoulder
It's the size of a boulder
And I use it to mould
All The stones that u throw
Into bricks into road
Yeah I paved to run you over
Came in how i grow
Into the game
On my own
Made my name
On my own
I reign any throne
Yeah I take yeah i own
After slayin
I moved on
To let in someone
To my heart
Two as one
And Us can't be undone
Ain't a game
Ain't for show
You Can't fake
Cause i know
'For u forsake
My mind shown
You a snake
And so slow
My namesake
Should have thrown
You haters a freaking bone
Can't be tamed
Can't be zoned
Can't be framed
Can't be honed
Not a single human being no not one
Has been where i been
And seen what i seen
Went from heights yoill never peak nah
To bottoms in lotta continents you gotta pull outta dictionary to even speak on
I'm the sickness the illness that will make you losers just be gone
