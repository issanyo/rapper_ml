It's like this and like that and like this and uh
It's nothing but an rbg thing baby

FIRST VERSE:
The freest the Realest the sleepless
Leave you speechless
In your vision u know me
If you missed it who I be
I'm a legion and just me
Vigilante kill a vigilante killer
More likely to be a cop killa than top
But you know I bring the realah than the mass appealas
Spherical opposition
Notorious rbg

Musicial precision of
Lyrical composition
Walking contradiction
Mocking the competition
Victorious eternally
Cause I'm only curious about me
Too nefarious to beat
Revolutionary yes
But also genius best believe
No more of this
Empirical revision
Satirical repetition
Very cold disposition
Needing no permission
Miracle like intuition
Maniacal I envision
More than my suspicion
Paranoid
But not superstition
If you've seen where I seen
Been what I been
Then maybe you'll get what I mean

HOOK:
Rbg revolutionary but genius
It's just an rbg thing baby

Rbg revolutionary but genius

It's just an rbg thing

Ftp
Rebellious to the pigs fleeces

It's just an rbg thing

Dtp
No justice so there can be no peace yet
I'm just an extremist to the squeamish
Fiendish to fascicious
Menace to the makers of this heinous framework the game all you weak ignoramuses playing in

It's like this and like that and like this and uh

VERSE TWO:
I'm a lethal combination
Injection of riteous indignation
With conviction of righteousness
Nothing to loose outlook
Born to be your nightmare
If you're what goes bump in the night to some innocent
Better bounce
Cause the real beast is here
What are you scared of death ?
Best not be if you seek to step to this
You see I don't mind my Qs and Ps
But my Ps and Qs will see you in ICUs
The light ahead through every dark day used to see it
Now been bathed in it and slid through to the other side
Left it behind
Future s bleak
Further I go forward
More pages I turn in my book
More I leave it behind me
See the peace you're all aiming for
I had it raw
Every piece
I shoulda been left dead
Now the rage is consuming me
Demons had a price on my head
With vision cursed me to see
Humanities insanity
Now the darkness phantasms of hell may have entered me
I'm ready to die see
And I don't mind taking you with me

THIRD VERSE
Can't stop a revolution in flow
No substitution I walk alone
I'll give you an oratory coronary
To get what my diction is blaring
You fiction based missionaries of cultural waste
Would have to get a dictionary post haste
But really you still couldn't get the meaning based
In empiricism delivered with lyrical precision
To blow through ordinary
Like it was a depiction of nuclear fissions vision
Im a visionary
You just shook and looking scary
I'll make your tale cautionary
Like an evolutionary fail
Compunction to expunge the frail
Non functionary lay it to waste
Like a discretionary label that I erase
Debunk then replace with

Thi-thi-thi-this this just the way it is
Bitch
