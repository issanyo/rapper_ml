[Intro]
Yo

[Hook]
These niggas with me in the streets and they hands on
You see them straps they got they hands on
Throw me the money aye I gotta count that hands on
Go get the work and drop it off I can’t be hands on
These niggas with me in the streets and they hands on
You see them straps they got they hands on
Throw me the money aye I gotta count that hands on
Go get the work and drop it off I can’t be hands on

[Verse 1]
Hand on your bitch hair while she sucking me off
One hand on the phone while I’m cooking this raw
Two hands on the money while I’m counting this check
Aye watch your step cause we don’t tolerate no disrespect
Cluck, cluck being with the plug and you can’t get in
367 that’s my shit and you can’t get in
The streets know about me and you a non factor
Hands on with the bricks like a contractor
Hands on with the weed I keep the kush coming
He bout to pull up in a mini aye I sip the youngin
Lower two prices they don’t cost shit
If you don’t look out for your folks that ain’t no boss shit

[Hook]
These niggas with me in the streets and they hands on
You see them straps they got they hands on
Throw me the money aye I gotta count that hands on
Go get the work and drop it off I can’t be hands on
These niggas with me in the streets and they hands on
You see them straps they got they hands on
Throw me the money aye I gotta count that hands on
Go get the work and drop it off I can’t be hands on

[Verse 2]
Now know where your man’s going it depends on it
But I’m a killer to be putting his motherfucking hands on it
Yeah you talk that shit but I walk that shit
I’m OG like Master P, I ain’t really bout that shit
So any nigga I have to put my hands on
So I did it for all the niggas they put the stand on
I’m in the killing zone until they send my nigga home
I got the right to go left with all that’s going on
I’m first of ten and third of som’n nigga I’m going on
You pussies prevent defense niggas been so alone
Never get mad and get mad and get my hands dirty
It’s fake money and fake bourbons that got your man murdered

[Hook]
These niggas with me in the streets and they hands on
You see them straps they got they hands on
Throw me the money aye I gotta count that hands on
Go get the work and drop it off I can’t be hands on
These niggas with me in the streets and they hands on
You see them straps they got they hands on
Throw me the money aye I gotta count that hands on
Go get the work and drop it off I can’t be hands on

[Verse 3]
Gotta put people in position when you winning
You might need those same folks when your ass losing
I got that work movement I got them hoes choosing
These niggas shooting but OG saluting
I learnt the game from seeing your niggas fucked up
And took a loss it ain’t much nigga I locked up
Pull them trucks up the work getting klepto
Wrap that money up and take her to the airport
Hands on with my money I ‘on trust a soul
Lost two hundred on 85 I don’t trust the road
Got the trap beating nigga like a drummer boy
Hands on that beat machine like I’m drummer boy

[Hook]
These niggas with me in the streets and they hands on
You see them straps they got they hands on
Throw me the money aye I gotta count that hands on
Go get the work and drop it off I can’t be hands on
These niggas with me in the streets and they hands on
You see them straps they got they hands on
Throw me the money aye I gotta count that hands on
Go get the work and drop it off I can’t be hands on

[Outro]
Yeah, oh, yeah, oh
