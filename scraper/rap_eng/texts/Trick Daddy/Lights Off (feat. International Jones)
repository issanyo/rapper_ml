And That Ass So Nice And Round

And She Know Cause She Throw Them Cheeks

And I Know Where Ya Get It From

Im Ready For Ya Im Ready For Ya
Who Told You To Put The Lights On
Im Ready For Ya Im Ready For Ya

And She The Type Thatll Eat A Dick Up Off Top
And Won't Stop Till' She Sop Up Every Drop

[Chorus: x2]
Who Told You To Put The Lights On
Im Ready For Ya Im Ready For Ya
Who Told You To Put The Lights On
