[T] Whassup little man, what's wrong wit'chu?
[T] Why you lookin so sad - what's wrong?

Man, I went to school today
And the teacher said I couldn't be no rapper

[T] Say what?  Why she tell you that?

She told me I had to be somethin, that's more realistic
Like I could actually be, like a construction worker or somethin

[T] Man, construction workers ain't realistic man
[T] You can't be out there done sawin all day, boy it's hot out there
[T] Man, just keep on goin to school, get your education
[T] That way, you can be anything you WANT to be

[Chorus: sung]
I just wanna sing, can I, sing you a song
I bet you'll love it (I just wanna sing) yeah yeah yeah
(I-I ain't askin for much)
[T] Well go 'head then
I just wanna sing, can I, sing you a song
I bet you'll love it (I ain't askin for much)

[Trick Daddy]
Listen; I just wanna make music, I just wanna verse or two
In fact, man, I wanna be a rapper too
And I could probably sing the blues
Cause I got problems too, plus I growed up in the projects too
Well can you put me on your soundtrack?
Cause I got a good theme song that Betty Right could probably sing on
Yo, I just want a chance at stardom
I just wanna be more than a thief or robbin
Well, what about a remix?  And I could probably make the beat
And get it done all in less than a week
And make it clean for the radio, so the kids could watch the video
Yo, but y'all don't hear me doe
Man, I just want a crack at it
If I fail I'll be back, cause I refuse to be a crack addict
I wanna prove the critics wrong
What started off with a poem done turned it into a song
Now I'ma sing it for you

[Chorus] w/ minor variations

[Trick Daddy]
Listen to me!  I wanna be a legend one day, that way
I can be put in the same category with Barry White and Marvin Gaye
And have a tribute dedicated to me
Sell platinum records and win Grammys so that the world can see
You could be anything that you want to be
Play sports or make music, just put your mind to it
And yo, I ain't the typical 'American Idol'
But when I'm done, I'm sure the boy Simon'll like me
Everybody can't act rap, and no matter how real the dream seem
E'rybody can't sing
But, there's another Michael Jordan or Tiger Woods
Somewhere right in the hood, plus
Yo you ain't never seen a, meaner team
Of tennis players than Venus and Serena
So, it's people like that that helped people like me
And they gave me the courage to sing, so I'ma sing it for ya

[Chorus] w/ minor variations

[Trick Daddy]
I wanna do commercial and TV shows
I wanna blow and sell records like the BeeGees sold
And I don't really need a chaffeur, I don't need a maid or a cook
Just a vacumn cleaner and coasters
And I can cook and clean for myself - with the right promo team
I feel, I can really do big things, and
I could probably write me a book
With all the stuff I got to tell 'em, it's got to be a best seller
And it's way deeper than a Coke and a smile
Why go to schools when the teachers ain't helpin us out?
My art teacher drive a Benz but he ain't bein artistic
I got music second period but the class won't listen
I wanna sing

[Chorus] w/ minor variations

[Trick Daddy over Chorus as it repeats]
So, to all the kids
All the mothers and fathers, sisters and brothers of the world
Y'know?  Our kids need encouragement
We need a reason, y'knahmsayin?
Let's show 'em somethin, let's give 'em somethin to look forward to
So all you teachers that ain't doin your job, y'all step aside
Cause I got a little brother and sister that's gon'
Grow up one day and be a teacher, and she gon' actually TEACH somethin
Y'know?  She gon' make it worth comin to school y'know?
It's deeper than free lunch now
I just wanna sing
I used to be just like you
But thank God, we got greater later
