Trick Daddy:

Ha ha, uh

Old School
Uh huh
Okay, Shut Up

Chorus: Trick Daddy (4x)
Ah ha, Okay
What's Up, Shut Up

Trick Daddy:
Ridin' 'round in my brand new, '99, 4 do', Volvo
I got a pocket full of B's, cocoa weed and ain't got no place to go tho'
But all my Boca Boys they know though, that's fo' sho' though
(Are those Bugle Boy jeans you're wearing?) Hell nah ho you know they Polo
I been used again, choosed again
This time been wrong to chop somethin' dumped by one of my union friends
Soon as they seen the Benz, hatin' season was in
Hell cause they figured me for not understandin' their reason being
But I'm the man for this
While y'all was doin' fine I was doin' time just, prayin' for this
Locked up, make a plan for this
Without all that fancy shit
Way too advanced for this
Just Polo socks, tanks tops and drawers up under my pants and shit
Shut Up

Chorus: Trick Daddy (8x)
Trina:
Okay who's the baddest bitch
I been real, been rich, bee don' had this shit
Big Benz, big house and shit
That's right, okay I been down with Trick
Okay it make sense to me
Cause if your money ain't right you speakin it French to me
Miss Trina don't play wit' me
Or you can say Miss Big, it's okay wit' me
You need a grand just to speak to me
Okay, are you sure you wanna sleep wit' me
Okay, you better be fo' sho'
Cause I don' left niggas like you stuck befo'
Okay, you can ball wit' me
Okay, since you got a hot knot spend it all wit' me
Okay, y'all know what's up
Okay, uh huh, I ride, Shut Up

Chorus: Trick Daddy (4x)
Co:

And them pretty ass jazzy hoes, bitch what's

So when I come through bitch show me love
Everbody that flow, then raise it up
You got that funk, then blaze it up

Shut Up

Chorus: Trick Daddy (8x)
Duece Poppito:
Lay down, playboy what's up
What about the slugs in your head and your gut
What's up with the keys to your truck
Your niggas ain't got B's in the cut
What's up with the safe, what's the combo
Open that shit nigga fuck all the convo
Say Shin, what's up wit' ya hatian
Party out, birds at the safehouse, waitin'

Nigga ya better not be playin' me
You gon' bleed to death, you understand me
What's up you ready to go
You ready to tongue kiss with the new 4-4
What's up fuck nigga say somethin'
Set your crime, ready to spray somethin'
Gun play, how I got the stripes
2-4-K turned out the lights
Gun play, how I got the stripes
2-4-K turned out the lights

Chorus: Trick Daddy (8x)
