[Intro: Natalie Cole]
Just to be where you are...
I can't say no
I can't say no
I can't say no

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
Wake up, new day, same shit
Get dressed, gotta pay my rent
Little off for the money I spent
Next week 'til I get my check
And I don't even wanna work at this job
Matter fact I've been workin' too hard
Let's say I quit today
Come back, go postal tomorr'
This time I'ma take shit too far
I don't give a fuck who you are
When you broke they do you so wrong
When you blow they knew you was raw
Two strikes so you can't sell coke
Two kids so we can't stay broke
But the street life all we know
So you know one thing? I can't say no

[Hook: Natalie Cole]
I can't say no
I can't say no
I can't say no
I can't say no

[Verse 2: Trick Daddy]
If it wasn't for the fact that I so happened to be rappin'
I'd prolly be jackin', prolly be trappin'
Somewhere traffickin' packages
Takin' this shit back to the bases
But that's the past and I'm tryin' to erase this
But how the hell am I s'posed to live
When the government want half on every mil'?
The cost of gas still climbin' rapidly
And I pay the city, the county, state
And mothafuckas still out there tryna tax me
I gotta sell more ringtones
I gotta cut back and stop usin' my juke phones
Cause at the rate I'm goin'
I'm bound to lose my home off the interest rate alone

[Hook: Natalie Cole]
I can't say no
(I can't say no, I can't say no)
I can't say no
(I can't say no, no)
I can't say no
(I can't say no)
I can't say no

[Outro: Trick Daddy]
How can I say no?
How can I say no after all this time?
If it wasn't for the ghetto, where would I be?
If it wasn't for those food stamps and welfare checks mama used to give me
Where would I be?
If it wasn't for the hood, if it wasn't for the addicts
If it wasn't for the fact that they was on drugs
That they didn't know enough not to get on drugs
Shit wasn't for the struggle
Wasn't for bad luck
Wouldn't be nothin'
