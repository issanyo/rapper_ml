3AM, we just started the party
It only happens in Miami, Miami

[Verse 1: Young Dolph]
We met at LA at the Grammys
She said she from a wealthy family
She then told me she a grown lady
And grown ladies don't wear panties
I flew to see her in Miami
She thick as fuck and she Spanish
And she brought her friend with her too though
It only happens in Miami
I might drop my top
Might cock my Glock
Might roll me a blunt
Might pour me a cup
Might fuck your ho then put that bitch out
If it ain't gas then put that shit out
If it ain't money then what it's about
Her and her friend they both call me papi
I got good weed and they got good sloppy, yeah

[Hook: DJ Stevie J]
She ridin' me like a Bugatti

[Verse 2: Zoey Dollaz]
She callin' me papi cause I'm from Miami
Best Spanish mami, pussy wet to sonics
She smell like Givenchy, her titties on plastic
But oh my that ass is fantastic
Come on vacation, might leave on probation
This city full of them Haitians
Fast money, everybody impatient
Fuck it let's take it to South Beach
Fountain do lobby
Liv on a Sunday, let's party
Bottles on bottles on bottles
She either a stripper or Instagram model
Lookin' for a meal ticket like the lotto
For niggas that's pullin' up in them Gallardos
And poppin' them bottles
Welcome to the city where I live
Miami nigga, we call it the crib

[Hook: DJ Stevie J]
She ridin' me like a Bugatti
Her friends other friends all on me papi
Got weed, molly, we saucy
3AM, we just started the party
It only happens in Miami, Miami
It only happens in Miami
It only happens in Miami, Miami
It only happens in Miami

[Verse 3: Trick Daddy]
Ridin' round in a Range first thing in the mornin'
Still hung over off of the liquor I drunk over at Liv on Sunday
Tired of these soft ass niggas keep talkin' bout killin' like they did the murders
You aren't deservin'
I flip 'em and burn 'em
And I trick 'em on dirty
When y'all tryna be funny
Ain't future in frontin', no
No groupie no stuntin'
Bitch ass niggas I came for the money
Don't get it confused my dude cause I am the realest
You got one life to lose fool cause I know the hittas
And I know the Cubans, the Haitians, and I know the dealers
9 times out of 10 if them is the real ones, them is my niggas
When you come to my city my niggas just handle your business
Enjoy the weather, the beaches, but please don't fall in love with my bitches, no
And you can party my nigga
And when you drink just handle your liquor
And you can tote your pistol but control your niggas
Before I blow my whistle
See I fuck with Stevie J
Y'all fuck niggas, y'all stuck with Stevie J
We rep Miami
And don't get it twisted cause that's my family

[Hook: DJ Stevie J]
She ridin' me like a Bugatti
Her other friends callin me papi
Got weed, got molly, we saucy
3AM, we just started the party
It only happens in Miami, Miami
It only happens in Miami
It only happens in Miami, Miami
It only happens in Miami
