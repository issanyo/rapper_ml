So why play wit it? Let a real man hit it

I like 'em tall dark, skin, thick and fine ass
Nice around, pants size 7, 8 or 9
And when she walk, she walk like she on the run way
And the paparazzi taken pictures of that booty

And when them flashes go to flashin' she go to shaking that ass
Faster and faster, big ol' ass just clapping
And when they put her song on it's like 'Girls gone Wild'
'Cause she the headliner and the girl poor and proud

But if they break it down she'll slow it down
And look back at it dat's if she's a real vet wit it
But she gotta have hips wit it
And know that one flat ass can make a whole clique look bad

To all you li'l booty bitches eat ya biscuits
Get thicker bitches, I know some niggas wanna fuck wit cha
But it's plain and simple they like 'em thicker
A lil' bit bigger like to tussle wit 'em 'fore they hit' em

What's down wit cha, mama, I'm just hollering what it do
Go put yo clothes on 'cause ya comin' wit my crew
Oh, you a big girl, I just love when them thighs loose
No time to fuck around it's goin' down in my room

A whole thang of ice 5th of brown and a thang of goose
Man, call trick and tell them niggas to bring the juice
And a couple more boxes of rubbers 'cause she the truth
I'm sayin' she a bad ass bitch and she'll prove it

Ass and some fat ass titties, yeah, they juicy
Dancin' just like one of them bitches that make movies
Bust my nut quick she was ready to take boosie
She bent over and told him she want it in her booty

Big fine work it right on time wit the music
Make a nigga spend his last dime on that coochie
A you know how she do it Chanel, Prada or Gucci
Super fire rough bitch make a nigga nut quick shit

She gotta tattoo of a kitten by her cat
And a pair of paws runnin' down the side of her draws
She from the tri-state dawg and she done tried it all
She so fine you mash rewind and nigga press pause

But let a play be a playa bout' it
Shackle handcuff her da sucker, hell give that girl some love
But not you ya like it when her booty do
She like it too and likes what it do to you

She playin' her mind games, flirtin' wit you havin' conversations
While she playin' wit her tongue ring
She lookin' mean in the low cut fitted jeans
The finest thing you ever seen wearin' a belly chain

Plus her man, he gettin' a lil' change doin' illegal things
And she expect for you to buy her things
They say money can't buy you love
And it's funny 'cause money damn sho' can buy you her
