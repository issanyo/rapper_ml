[Intro, Trey Songz & Trick Daddy]
Trick Daddy Dollaz
Eightball, Trey Songz
We high
Good evenin' ladies and gentleman
This is your captain speakin' to ya
I'd like to welcome all of you aboard my flight
A flight that's promised to take you high
Way high up in the sky
So get out ya blunts
Ya Dutchmasters and ya Backwoods
And I'll turn ya seatbelt signs off

[Verse 1: Trick Daddy]
I only smoke the best bud
Jamaica and Bahamas got the best herb, yes sir
I could smoke, toke after toke
Won't give a triple choke and it won't hurt my throat, nope
Chinky eyed, just ridin' and vibin' on that real fire
Be high for two, three hours
And I'm cool with A-I, but hey
I ain't too much into Phillie's but split a Dutch and I'll re-fill it
And I ain't friendly, so nope, ya can't hit it
I smoke good trees, your collard greens full of reefer seeds
You use too many chemicals
Too much added stuff, fool, it ain't real kush
One joint of that G-14
Will have you higher than your highest dreams, just floatin'
Not knowin' if you're comin' or goin'
But when it's partly cloudy, be prepared for the storm and get high

[Hook: Trey Songz]
Roll up and feel the vibe, lay back, enjoy the ride
Inhale, deep inside, exhale, we so high
Roll up and feel the vibe, lay back, enjoy the ride
Inhale, deep inside, exhale, we so high
High, high, high
Deep inside, high, we so high
High, deep inside, high, we so high
High, feel the vibe, high, lay back, enjoy the ride

[Verse 2: Eighball]
Roll a Cigarillo, fire it up and hit it
Feels so good man, it's hard for me to quit it
M-I-A, land of the palm trees
T double D came through with the bomb trees
And when a nigga inhale this
I had to put my shades on, get behind tint
In the clouds, lookin' down on the ground
Eightball, big black playa from the mound
Remember when, I used to have them dime-sacks
Lil ma circle by my house with the weed trap
Now my Zip-Lock's be full of bubble-kush
Spark it like a broad's bush when she's on douche
Fruit cocktail, you could tell by the smell
Burn one, let the whole club know I'm here
Let's fly tonight
Come ride with your boy and get high tonight

[Intermission: Trey Songz & Trick Daddy]
Feel the vibe
Ain't nothin' like bein' able to smoke-smoke good-good
Enjoy the ride, deep inside
And be way up here in the air
We so high
Away from all the troubles
Feel the vibe
And problems that's goin' on down there in the real world
Enjoy the ride
Oh, it feel good, don't it?
Deep inside, we so high

[Hook: Trey Songz]
Roll up and feel the vibe, lay back, enjoy the ride
Inhale, deep inside, exhale, we so high
Roll up and feel the vibe, lay back, enjoy the ride
Inhale, deep inside, exhale, we so high

[Verse 3: Trick Daddy]
The only people I know, who don't smoke
Is Jesus, C-O, and my last P-O
Yo, but I ain't on papers no more
Ain't gotta creep and sneak, at least not to blow
I spent my first two years gettin' high
By smokin' dollar joints rolled outta 1.5's
That was 'round '84, '85
Smoke all week for the dimes, now nigga, that's live
Visine to help clear my eyes
Sprayed cologne on, when it was time for me to go home
I been doin' this for twenty years
Ain't never seen or heard one man that weed done killed
So just chill, take a puff here, there
To bring ya down a lil' off ya pills
After that, go and eat'cha a meal
But you gon' have to bathe ya ass to get the smell out your hair, yeah

[Hook: Trey Songz]
Roll up and feel the vibe, lay back, enjoy the ride
Inhale, deep inside, exhale, we so high
Roll up and feel the vibe, lay back, enjoy the ride
Inhale, deep inside, exhale, we so high

[Outro: Trick Daddy]
Sad enough, yours truly
The booger-man himself
'Bout to take you all across the world
Take ya everywhere with the electric chair
Gon' let you see anythin' with the wind
But then again
You'll never get high like this again
Come again my friends
