Chorus)
This for the boys that's on the grind/
Servin bids and doin crime/
Stuck in the pen and doin time/
Facin 10, 20, Life/

(Verse 1)
Make ways of the 90's/
Babies havin babies (Babies havin babies)/
N*****s dyin young/
Boy this s**t crazy/
You got drugs and guns/
But a n***a need them/
Prospect for a jack/
Then you can squeeze them/
To his head/
Left him deader than a doorknob/
Chose to rob/
He should have got a muthaf****n job/
His kids left without a pops/
Cuz he got shot/
His mama struggle every 5/
Now she slangin her car/
Probably lost full cost/the bills are late/
S****y diapers on her babies/
And they haven't ate/
So she flex/catch a date/its her duty though/
She never h*'d but it's the only way to go/
She turned a trick/got a bare buck/food to eat/
The bills are due in one week/so she'll be back on the street/
She get a check/but that ain't s**t but the f****n rent/
And food stamps in the wind/that ain't s**t to spend/
Oldest child is her son in the 7th grade/
And he'll just be turning 12 on his birthday/
A small boy with a brain to make a good life/
But he don't sleep at night/
So he can't function right/
Sister needin a crib/
He gots to pull through/
Quit school/snatched a book/and hit for grands too/
He was in love wit school/now they won't let him back/
He started hangin with the boys/now he slangin crack/
He got this young girl pregnant/what she gon do/
Have a baby hope his daddy don't die too/
The young n****'s in the county on the 10th floor/
Jumped out and roped him with a little dope/
His first charge so they gave him house arrest/
He better chill/cuz he don't know the prison next/
He left his crib one night/went out hangin out/
He wasn't home when the c******s came by the house/
Now he up the road at
Brevard
Wit a year to do/
Now he wildin' already doin his whole two/
His little shorty bout to walk/soon to talk/
His mama is the daddy/because that is all he saw/

(Chorus)

And now this n***a need money up the road/
Plus a pair of shoes and socks to wear to vis her/
She try to visit every week now she dead broke/
She missed one weekend because she needed flow/
He cursed her out/called her names/made the girl cry/
She won't accept his phone calls/and he wonder why/
She got another n***a in her life now/
She tired of kissin a** and getting cursed out/
He found the will to chill/now he on the turf/
Told the girl lies/Promised that he gon work/
She left that n***a/went back to that same jit/
He copped a vert/on ther corner doin the same s**t/
She sayin/You told me things/and I believed them all/
They stay together/got a condo up in C.C./
A water bed/big screen t.v./
He getting money but he ain't savin none up/
Dropped a grip/bought his big new dodge truck/
He sixteen but he deep in the dope game/
Got connections to them boys slangin cocaine/
He got a name/all the h**s call him diamond d**k/
But he got robbed one night for this big lick/
They had the ups/he couldn't buck/down to gave it up/
They got all his jewelry/10 grand/and his new truck/
And now he back on his d**k but he pissed off/
He knew the jack boys got him/go and take em out/
He got drunk one night and told his boys off in the hood/
How he got his money back and now he doin good/
He ridin round his city with the same gun/
Police pulled the boy/booked a murder 1/
He made the news/now he famous got a lil rep/
Done left his lady and his baby/ all by they self/
Jumped on a plea/5 for 3/
Now its cold comin from his dog JB/
JB drivin his shit/fuckin his best bitch/
Supposed to be best friends/and he done crossed the jit/
And he holla at his shorty every week/kinda mad at the h* so they don't speak/
Outta sight/outta mind/cuz he got time/
And he ain't getting out until 2029/
