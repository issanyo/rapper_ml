(J.V.)
The game done switched
Niggas who was po' got rich
Niggas who was real turned snitched
Ain't that a bitch?
That's why I get mine on the low
Hustle 'til a nigga can't ball no mo'
Fall to the flo'
Cause the shit don't stop
Shit get real right here, Money Mark
J to the Dot
I make shit hot
I don't even really wanna hear what you got
Just sign me right when I come for my cheese
Ain't too many niggas down like these
Stand right there while I count my B's
If anything missin' get a hole in your knees
Freeze
I might talk low but I don't stutter
Hot ones go right through like butter
If you feel like a big dog, bite don't ball
Hell, you can get it too if I pull your card

(Trick Daddy)
Nigga don't be fuckin' wit' my cheese
You know I'm 'bout my B's
You better have my cheese
'Cause I go crazy
(repeat)

(Money Mark)
I keep flow plus hoes on the side of me
Plus I'm playin' these noodles like ivory
I make 'em ride for me
Tounge kiss 'em make 'em die for me
I get their cheddar then I'm outtie, see
I'm fien to seen all means for the dough
Chop a nigga down if my greens don't grow
Y'all know about flow
So niggas stop puttin' up a front
And give a muthafucka what he want
'Fo you end up in the trunk of the dunk witcha hoe
Layin' on my hot ass amps like "oh"
Nigga think it's a game
Remember Money sparks the name
And it ain't no thang to do a nigga 'bout change
See I love money man
If cane involved then nigga you a lost cause
Shit, I'll hit you with my razor blade
Cut off your balls
Sit you in some alcohol
(Aaaah!) Oh Lord!

(Trick Daddy)
Nigga don't be fuckin' wit' my cheese
You know I'm 'bout my B's
You better have my cheese
'Cause I go crazy
(repeat)

(J.V.)
I gotta get me fa sho the whole 9
So when the sun hit me they say "whoa now"
"He done blowed now"
"J.V. outta control now"
And if they didn't bet they know now
And I don't floss but you gotta know it cost
Don't like the boats but you know I'm goin' off
You know who the boss
Who gon' win and who lost
And when it's by J.V. you know I want it all, hmm
Is they in love with the dubs or the lex?
Or do they know I'm just as good as it gets?
You wanna go next?
If so we can hit it
Long as you know J.V. out to get it
'Cause when it's 'bout my cheese - I'ma clown for mine
If it's B's or it's G's - I gets down for mine
Bust rounds for mine
Put you face in the ground for mine
I'ma hound for mine
Hell bound for mine

(Trick Daddy)
Nigga don't be fuckin' wit' my cheese
You know I'm 'bout my B's
You better have my cheese
'Cause I go crazy
(repeat)

Go crazy, go crazy, go crazy, go crazy, go crazy, go crazy

'Cause I go crazy, go crazy, go crazy, go crazy, go crazy
(repeat until fade)
