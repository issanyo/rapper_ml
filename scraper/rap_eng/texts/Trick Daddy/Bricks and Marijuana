Verse 1:Kase

I been put in the world
Living my days ducking k's
Was bursting bitches jumping out they Benz's on blades
I been scuffling years you honor
I swear the God I wanna do for my kid's you honor
If you was me then you would see how it is you honor
Through all the drama and this rain
Nobody felt my pain
I went to serving after fame
Then shit changed
You wonder what am I to do
Niggas on my block
Am I supposed to be a fuck nigga?
Let 'em rope my spot
When Jeb Bush pushing life
If I tout my weapon
Now Ronald Reagan was selling guns
But he ain't a felony
A house on the hills with all these bills
I gots to sell 'em
My shawty waking up with out his Christmas
What the fuck I'ma tell 'em?
When I be juggling selling bricks?
Will heaven take me?
Now 25 plus life
Rehabilitate me
These crackers calling me a monster
But they help create me
Shit


Hook: 4x

Look I been scuffling years your honor
That's why I'm traffickin' these bricks and marijuana
Shit

Verse 2: Kase

Ain't seen my momma since the last time we hung out
Now six years to be exact
Cause she strung out
My getting jobs looking shady, on my application
Now have I ever committed felons?
Look at this shit I'm facing
And now these streets don't get no better for my young niggas
Now the muthafuckers that's coming up is the gravediggers
And I can't seem to trust my niggas
And I grew up with 'em
Folk in my mind at times learn not to fuck with 'em
When I was stuck who could I turn to?
Nobody but Jesus
I'm in this world looking up to the gangsters
Looking up to the leaders
Granddaddy had a stroke and grandmomma broke
Who the fuck gone feed us?
Y'all wrapped us in ropes and put us on boats
But y'all really ain't need us
Muthafuck that shit
I got tired of the struggling
??? in the jungle
Can't let a nigga fuck me about this coke
So I learned what was and what wasn't
I'm getting them things at 17
At least gone cop a dozen
You lose yo life
Shit ain't no joke
That's if yo coke is buzzing
Shit

Hook: 4x

Look I been scuffling years your honor
That's why I'm traffickin' these bricks and marijuana

Mystic(Talking)

Now what I'm talking bout
Got niggas doing the dirty dirty
Now what I'm saying
But it can't last dirty to long
Nigga gotta clean up somewhere
So, you know what I'm talking bout
Take a nigga advice and get in and get out baby boy
Cause it ain't all bad
But it ain't all good
Now what I'm talking bout
And the hood dangerous watching out
Everybody shouldn't be po-po
Dealing with the dope dope
So you better watch out boy
Get in and get ouuuut

Hook: 2x

Look I been scuffling years your honor
That's why I'm traffickin' these bricks and marijuana
