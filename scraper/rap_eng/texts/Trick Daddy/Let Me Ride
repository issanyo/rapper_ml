Trick Daddy
I used to be a polo kid
Who would of thought of all the stupid shit that I did
I used to sport it talk about it
That's the reason why shorty went in the hood and bought it
Mr. Rabbit like a fast from the past bone jean overalls yall can kiss my ass
Thug nigga going back to the basic
And that Iceberg on the curve is thug animated
But first off this is T double
When I hitya with them k cutters
You turn bout three colors
Gon and get your big brother I don't care
I'm dade county major slash player
Hold up 'cause Mr. Dollar got sold up
Time for war now be a boy what's the hold up
A new candiate for the thug of the year
I'm the ultiment thug the rest of them busta is quitters

Chrous: repeat 2x

Rick Ross
You know it's your boy R Ross, the overweight hell of a nigga so pepperlicoius
And we getting it
Sitting on serious inches
We dem niggas smoking coco and serious vison
(at the door) bouncers don't touch us
They know once ounces go up they hold up
And know what
I drink cris let it bubble back

I'm leaning on double stack ready to snap
Trick already know yall ain't ready for us
We make a way in the club waving a slug come play with a thug
I can let yall lay in the mud
I battle you partner
A spotter that's hotter with a nuff music to wake pac up
Keep your Glocks up you can't stop us
True husltler chop doctors knot in pockets
In truly didited or god got us

Chrous: repeat 2x
