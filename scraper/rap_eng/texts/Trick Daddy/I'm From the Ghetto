[Intro: DJ Khaled]
We the besssst..
I represent the hood..
I represent the ghetto..
I represent the people..
I represent YOU - LISTENNN!!!

[Chorus: Dre & The Game]
All the money in the world couldn't change me
No diamond rings or the fancy cars
Cause my niggas in the hood woulda left me
Holdin this because
(I'm from the ghetto) I'm from the ghetto
(I'm from the projects) I'm from the projects
All over the world and every hood they know
I'm from the ghetto and thats fo sho'
(I'm from the ghetto) I'm from the ghetto
(I'm from the projects) I'm from the projects (Ayo Khaled)
All over the world and every hood they know
(Walk with me) I'm from the ghetto and thats fo sho'
(I'm from the ghetto)

[Verse 1: The Game]
Yeah, that's what got me here
The Chucks, the khaki suits, all the swap meet years
The six dollar socks, the five dollar rocks
Uncle Greg rest in peace, he taught me how to chop
That's why I love the hood and everything we got
From the ice cream trucks to the forty ounce tops
All white Air Force Ones, the fake Jacob watch
A few reasons why I drive the Bently hard top
Use it in my songs cause I live it on the block
Tattoo it on my face let the whole world watch
I'm that type of nigga y'all made my city bigger dawg
Dog turn the TV off, got tired of watchin Jigga boss
So we told our moms we is lookin for jobs
When we was really in the record store lookin for Nas
Project or the ghetto, ghetto and the projects
From Compton to being Dre's number one prospect, so

[Chorus: Dre & Jadakiss]
All the money in the world couldn't change me
No diamond rings or the fancy cars
Cause my niggas in the hood woulda left me
Holdin this because
(I'm from the ghetto) I'm from the ghetto
(I'm from the projects) I'm from the projects
All over the world and every hood they know
I'm from the ghetto and that's fo sho' (Uh-huh)
(I'm from the ghetto) I'm from (Hahhh-hahhh) the ghetto
(I'm from the projects) I'm from (Yeah) the projects (Uhh)
All over the world and every hood they know (They know)
I'm from the ghetto and thats fo sho' (I'm from the ghetto)

[Verse 2: Jadakiss]
Uhh, Ain't no help there
Just food stamps, weight checks and welfare (uh-huh)
Every man gone for self there
Still might need to borrow your medicate card for health care
Yeah, if you never got knocked then you made it (ha-ha)
Everybody know eachother if not they related
You can get shot or get bladed
There's dudes that got jobs now that had blocks in the 80's
Six months, five years for you just to cop out (yup)
Ninth or tenth grade is usually when niggas drop out (yup)
Fights break out when you wired and start joking (huh)
Alot of OG's retired and started smokin
House party games of spade sweet Kool-Aid
Loud music all night till the boys in blue raid
So therefore, I could never be too paid
I know where I'm going and where I'm from will get you laid
Get em

[Chorus: Dre & Trick Daddy]
All the money in the world couldn't change me
No diamond rings or the fancy cars
Cause my niggas in the hood woulda left me
Holdin this because
(I'm from the ghetto) I'm from the ghetto
(I'm from the projects) I'm from the projects
All over the world and every hood they know
I'm from the ghetto and thats fo sho'
(I'm from the ghetto) I'm from the ghetto
(I'm from the projects) I'm from the projects
All over the world and every hood they know (ha-ha)
I'm from the ghetto and thats fo sho' (I'm from the ghetto) (Ha)

[Verse 3: Trick Daddy]
Tell me this how come
Black folks get a lil doe and forget where they come from (come from)
Man we used to have good times (oh)
But since you moved on up guess you ain't cool with us (uh-uh)
We still support you tho we don't see you much (yup)
You ain't the first fool it's cool with us
But why you living out your idols dreams
Remember how far you came and help you keep them thangs? (show up)
Now its cool that your address changed
But I'm tryna holla at my dog and the number ain't the same (damn)
I guess new homies came with his fame (say what)
But see true homies will stay the same
Through all the up's and down's in your career
A couple wives, few kids scattered here (that's right)
And when you dead or broke without a deal
All the groupies cleared, the ghetto'll still be here, haa

[Chorus: Dre]
All the money in the world couldn't change me
No diamond rings or the fancy cars
Cause my niggas in the hood woulda left me
Holdin this because
(I'm from the ghetto) I'm from the ghetto
(I'm from the projects) I'm from the projects
All over the world and every hood they know
I'm from the ghetto and thats fo sho'
(I'm from the ghetto) I'm from the ghetto
(I'm from the projects) I'm from the projects
All over the world and every hood they know
I'm from the ghetto and thats fo sho' (I'm from the ghetto)
