[Intro: Ace Hood]
Ace Hood!
See I want to introduce you to my block
I want to introduce you to my hood
I want to introduce you to the gutter

[Chorus: Ace Hood]
I’m making money, oh what a feeling
Ask me how I get I just tell em mind your business
Cause mine is problems, all kind of problems
Ask me if I care, I say fuck it I’m from the bottom
Nigga I’m gutta (than a motherfucker)
Nigga I’m gutta (than a motherfucker)
I’m out the door, in the vert
Pistol on my left tryna get to work
Nigga I’m gutta (than a motherfucker)
Nigga I’m gutta (than a motherfucker)
If you think it ain’t, name the place
I leave you ass stitched with your bitchy face

[Verse 1: Ace Hood]
Any nigga want to know I’m gutta
I be running on the block by trouble
Young nigga, big clip in a bundle
Black keys, big ki's in a duffel
Bag, that’s full of that cash
And full of that grass, and full of them mags
That bitch, she holding that stash
And holding that cash, the men on that ass
I grab work then I'm into that Jag
The black flag just to go with that [?]
And I don’t really give a fuck who mad
I leave a nigga in a body bag
Cause I’m gutta, you don’t want to [?]
A street nigga, real nigga, I’m that
Ace Hood and I’m all about cash
If you touch that stack, tell em that’s your last

[Chorus: Ace Hood]
I’m making money, oh what a feeling
Ask me how I get I just tell em mind your business
Cause mine is problems, all kind of problems
Ask me if I care, I say fuck it I’m from the bottom
Nigga I’m gutta (than a motherfucker)
Nigga I’m gutta (than a motherfucker)
I’m out the door, in the vert
Pistol on my left tryna get to work
Nigga I’m gutta (than a motherfucker)
Nigga I’m gutta (than a motherfucker)
If you think it ain’t, name the place
I leave you ass stitched with your bitchy face

[Verse 2: Trick Daddy]
I’m the, black flag ambassador
And I don’t ride without my five
When them niggas go to acting up
Them boys in the black go to masking up
Close shop, pack it up
Don’t block me in, bitch back it up
I’m from the city where they sift it and back it up
Either that, whip it and crack it up
Quick flip, sack it up
Big clips is a nigga that’ll back me up
No sister [?] back before
Give them pussy niggas what they asking for
History, I’m a part of that
Gutta shit, I started that
You don’t rep the hood, your money no good
Young nigga I don’t want no part of that
Cause I’m gutta

[Chorus: Ace Hood]
I’m making money, oh what a feeling
Ask me how I get I just tell em mind your business
Cause mine is problems, all kind of problems
Ask me if I care, I say fuck it I’m from the bottom
Nigga I’m gutta (than a motherfucker)
Nigga I’m gutta (than a motherfucker)
I’m out the door, in the vert
Pistol on my left tryna get to work
Nigga I’m gutta (than a motherfucker)
Nigga I’m gutta (than a motherfucker)
If you think it ain’t, name the place
I leave you ass stitched with your bitchy face

[Verse 3: Ace Hood]
[?] nigga want to know how I get down
Take out timbo then the 4 pound
Fuck nigga get slugged when it come down
All goons with the work in the low down
I’m gutta, straight hood when I go round
Got stacks in the back of the Greyhound
Fuck that, and the K say lay down
Pop pop, you duck when the K sounds
So you niggas better mind your business
You don’t really want problems homie
I get that [?] please put that on my pink [?]
Nigga these suicides with the big mac
All black, all black, and the ski mask
[?] long fours in the meat bag
Enemy get shot for [?]

[Chorus: Ace Hood]
I’m making money, oh what a feeling
Ask me how I get I just tell em mind your business
Cause mine is problems, all kind of problems
Ask me if I care, I say fuck it I’m from the bottom
Nigga I’m gutta (than a motherfucker)
Nigga I’m gutta (than a motherfucker)
I’m out the door, in the vert
Pistol on my left tryna get to work
Nigga I’m gutta (than a motherfucker)
Nigga I’m gutta (than a motherfucker)
If you think it ain’t, name the place
I leave you ass stitched with your bitchy face
