All 'em niggas in them Chevy's

Hey, what's up, playa hatin niggas need to shut the fuck up! (Shut up!)
Cut it out
Make my name taste like shit in ya mouth (Doodoo!)
Same niggas that be talking this shit
Be the first niggas speak when I walk in that bitch
Them lame niggas that be hatin' on Trick
Jump right in they whip and go to funkin my shit!
You know how niggas be (yes)
They ya dawgs while ya there but they talk 'bout you when you leave
I'm like fuck nigga, please
You couldn't get a blessing from me if you fuck niggas sneezed
Up fire, like fuck nigga freeze
Don't move don't mothafuckin' breathe!
See I was raised to be fucknigga-free
If You don't like what I'm sayin', then fuck nigga leave!
I, stay far away from sucka niggas
Get money, live life, like fuck a nigga
You, you and your crew and some other shit
Fake thugs who indulge in that sucka shit!

I rep that M.I.A whole state of the FLA
And we known for the BASS
We got pills, got weed, got yay, SK's, AK's
And a whole lot of BASS
Where my Dunk Ryder niggas at?
With the funk in the trunk
Let 'em hear that BASS
Thugs nigga wanna feel that BASS
All the ladies go crazy when they hear that BASS

My momma, grand momma they straight out the woods
So if I'm GA, Alabama, or South Carolina just know that I'm good

Start snappin' go to slappin' all the fuck niggas
Back hand any nigga wearin' tight pants
Fuck nigga might as well wear lace wigs
