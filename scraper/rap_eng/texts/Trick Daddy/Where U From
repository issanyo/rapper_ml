(Verse 3: Deuce Poppito)
I throw a bullet atcha like a Danny Marino floater
I'ma half a brick slanging, nutts swinging, weed roller
Bustin a blue 4-4 with the speed loader
How they go toe to toe with the 44 touter
Fo' show do
Room is full of pimps and thugs
Ghetto pharmacies with prescription drugs
Banging like Krypts and Bloods
We wiping slugs
Our enemies dripping blood
Workers at the graveyard late nite diggin mud
To prepare ya for ya pillow inside the box
When I ride the blocks I always hide my Glocks
In the dash board next to my passport
In the double S I paid thirteen cash for
My name is Richard Nixon but they screaming Deuce Pop
With the one stop shop
Heroin, weed, and rocks
I feed the block
And ride the strip in a tinted drop
And I even met the niggas who invented rocks
I got the block game from the county of Dade
A bounty hunter won't rest till my bounty is paid
We got 200 hundred bricks coming from the direct link
I pray to God the boat carryin that coke don't sink, what

(Deuce Hook:)
It's Deuce Poppie nigga
I'm from the home of the chrome and the chopper triggers
Whassup, holla nigga
