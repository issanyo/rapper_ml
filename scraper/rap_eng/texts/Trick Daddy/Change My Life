[Hook]
Gotta change my life
Lord knows I ain't livin right
Yall know I ain't chilling right
Smokin out everyday and night
Gotta ease my mind
Gotta find time to rewind
Cause I'm falling way behind
Me and my dogs be on the grind

Gotta watch my back
Represent for the soldierz
Die couple years older
Have boulders, a lil soda
Get rich with a motive
Now shit done changed
Niggas gunning in the rain
On straight cocaine
And it ain't no thang
Since the game in his arm
Straight aim at his arm
Gotta watch my back
Gotta stack my flow
Gotta pay my bills
Leave bread in the will
All to the old girl
See yall hoes betta chill
Now back to the game
Lots of niggas done died for this
Done lost they lives to this
Got me on this survival some type of AK rider shit
Now It started with thug
A thug with a heart
Took a trip with some hard
Had to do it he was scared
See his mama in the park
Tears dried up
Mom what's wrong (what's wrong)
Your son's gone
Is he ever coming back home
She said you straight young nigga
Take a look in tha mirror
I was there when you was gone
Now back to the streets
Where young niggas like me
Gon do what we got to do
You ain't nuttin without ya crew
But ah light in tha night and I'm thinking bout you
In the bedroom tied up
With ya mouthpiece wired up
With a safe in the floor
And that yayo then had muthafuckaz fired up
An see that's the truth
I done told my nigga this street shit ain't a game
But it seem the same
Young nigga get slain
For a lil bit a fame and cocaine
Try to do thangs
Just for the benzs and beamers and bitches
Thinkin riches gon take care snitches
And niggas wit triggaz
Niggas betta watch they back
Cuz the same time I'm trying to speak to you and release to you
Some shit ya need
Young nigga wit greed gonna try to put the heat to you
Heat to you

[Hook]



They call it a jack
In the donk with the gat
Ski mask and a vest
Let his heart do the rest
Thuggin, broke niggas be the best
Yes, and gon die if ya buck
Get fucked right up
Come back if ya like
Bring ya gat if ya like
And get splacked if ya like
On ya back if ya like
All I needed was a chance
A MAC-10 and a benz
So I can clown with my friends
Show the world I'm a man
Then breakâ€‹ my dawgz out the pen
When I'm off in the club
Much love for the thugs
See Hennessy in the clubs
Got all these rabid ass, maggot hoes
They warm it up

[Hook] - 2X

Now bout dem hoes
Try to find them a man
That can pay they bills
And yes they can
Weight 28 grams
Take a tour of the land
Ain't got no plan
They'll wait for a thug
Go give em a hug
Show em how to be loved
Then suck em up
Straight fuckin em up
Then get in his benz
Get with all his friends
Take all his ends
Then send him to the pen
Then do it all again
Amen
But lord forgive em
Have mercy on they're souls
For livin like hoes
And say a lil prayer for me and my life
Cuz I ain't livin right you know I

[Hook] - repeat until fade
