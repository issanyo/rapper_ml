Good evening: Ladies, Gentlemen, Pimps and Whores, and the rest of you animals
Dont'cha know that sex sells
That's why my hundred dollar bills smell like pubic hairs
She work hard for the money
Accused of being a whore, but just an entrepreneur
An of course she's self-employed
Learned that cause her momma was a whore before
Game face cause ain't shit funny
Daddy like, "Bitch, better have my money!"
Now, that's my kind of whore
Go to sleep, and have dreams about King Ding-a-Ling

They call me Champion King Ding-a-Ling
They call me Champion King Ding-a-Ling
They call me Champion King Ding-a-Ling
They call me Champion King Ding-a-Ling
