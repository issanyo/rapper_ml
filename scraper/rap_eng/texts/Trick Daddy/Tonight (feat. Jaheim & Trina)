(Trick Daddy - Intro:)
You lookin' real good baby
Yes u is
I just want you to know
I had a wonderful time this evening
But unfortunately
I guess this part of the story
Well we tell each other good night
Nah how about this?
How about I break all the rules?
And tell you what I really been thinkin'

(Jaheim:)
Girl you got the big ol ass
And bowed legs
And fine hair
And all the shit that I want
Sexy mothaf**ka
You acting like you want it right now
Let a nigga know
Is we gon f**k tonight?
My dick is gettin' rock hard
Oh my god
There's gonna be some f**kin' tonight
Take your panties off
Or move them things off to the side
And let a nigga know
Is we gun f**k tonight?

(Trick Daddy - Verse 1)
See good pussy
Will bring the freak out ya
But if you eat it and don't get cheated
The first off I beat the breaks off her
No sense in half-steppin'
Gettin serious
Get the titties suckin' like
Clit rubbin' and ass grabbin'
I eat that pussy ass backwards
A few strokes of this long warm tongue
Should make the pussy cum
So much for round one
I spend a whole round two in back of u
Stick & move
Stick & move

(Jaheim:)

(Trina - Verse 2:)
I need a real man
I'm sick of playin' with lil' boys
I'm tryin' to explore more
Like hot oils and sex toys
I can't keep fakin'
Man I'm so backed up and
I can't eat I can't sleep

My knees weak makin' me keep shakin'
I need a real nigga to come save me
One who pamper me and bathe me
And make me wanna swallow his baby
Talkin' thug shit like f**k me crazy
From the back or in the butt
I'm like f**k me baby f**k me baby

(Trick Daddy - Verse 3:)
All the matter is
I can get you wet again
Suck you f**k you better than
Any other nigga can
I specialize in multi-orgasms
Gettin' rid of back spasms
And do it all without viagra
I'll f**k you all night
Make you sleep all day
Treat you to breakfast then
Eat you for breakfast
I know baby
I'm so unselfish
But you're lovin' it besides
I'm a freak so I can't help it
All I need is old slow songs
One cold shot of patron
See you walkin' around me in a thong
And it'll be over before the chorus come back on
You'll be leavin and I'll be ad libin'
And we'll be singin' our damn song
It's like the first time we made each other cum
We'll be sucked and f**ked each other
Taste each other cum
No soul alive can erase what we done
All our horny sticky memories you are stuck to me permanantly
