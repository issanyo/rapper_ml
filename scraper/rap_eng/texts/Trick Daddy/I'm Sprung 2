[Hook: T-Pain]
I'm sprung
Dog she got me!
Got me doin things I'll never do
If you ain't been, I'm tellin you
I'm sprung.. (I'm sprung)
Dog she got me!
Got me doin things I'll never do
If you ain't been, I'm tellin you

[Verse 1: Youngbloodz 1 - with "you do" in the background]
It's somethin bout'cha
That's got me doin things I said I'd never do
And I can say I'm amazed
The way you put it on me, how you got me chasin you
And I could care less, I could give a damn
Cause see you my ride or die
You're a down ass bitch who don't take no shit
Keep it real though and still look fly

[Verse 2: Youngbloodz 2]
Real talk I'ma tell you out the whip
It ain't yo' face and it ain't yo' hips
It's how you roll my weed and lick dem lips
And, when I dip shawty you don't even trip
You give me rubberbands for my grip
You the fly bitch steppin up out my whip
I'm your nigga girl we like "This done"
And when the hook say you got me like dat dere I'm sprung

[Bridge 1: T-Pain]
Oooh she got me doin the dishes
Anything she want for some kisses
I'm cookin for her when she gets hungry
All she do is actin like she want me
She cuttin off all my homies
Even all my other 'ronies
She ain't even my main lady
See I been thinkin 'bout it lately
Man! She really don't deserve me
All she wanna do is hurt me
So I gotta get away from her...
But now I'm leavin quickly
Before she come and try to get me
And I'm takin everythang with me
When it all come down to her

[Hook] w/ ad libs

[Verse 3: Pitbull - with "you do" in the background]
Everything about you girl, it drives me wild
From your thighs to your eyes to the way you smile
I think about you, more than I should
You classy, sexy, yeah with a twist of hood
I'd love to put this tongue on you fast like Twista would
From the front, to the back I wanna make you feel good
Let me know baby what you want and how you want it hey
You know how boys get down when they from DADE!
Pitbull, T-Pain, girl this a G thang
Meanin we don't stop 'til we find the G spot
Picture us rollin in the seven tray, no top
With a 454 block, step on the gas
Like bad coca, step on they ass
If they try to stop what we got, come on mayne!
You like the blood in my veins, the air in my lungs
Bottom line, mami, I'm sprung

[Bridge 2: T-Pain]
Oooh so we went our separate ways
It's been a couple of days
But now I'm doin what I want to
With nobody tellin me what I'm gon' do
And I'm feelin so free
With nobody but me
Now I can handle all my business
All of my fellas, can I get a witness
But I'm feelin kinda lonely
On top of that I'm kinda horny
And I gotta get back to her...
Now I'm leavin quickly
Before she come and try to get me
And I'm takin everythang with me
When it all come down to her

[Hook] w/ ad libs

[Verse 5: Trick Daddy - with "you do" in the background]
I ain't never been a sucker for love
Never even had a gilrfriend 'til I started fuckin with her
Ain't never even knocked her down
And she hooked on awards tryin to lock me down
With one flick of the tongue I was sprung
And we didn't get done 'til fo' or five in the mornin
She had me deep in the zone
You get a brand new wardrobe but baby you ain't goin home
The new Jag and all the Louis bags
Chanel and Excata straight from Belle Harbor
I told my homeboys I'll holla
I got plans for a date, my girl want steaks
And she prefer Benihana's
We can go from Monday to Sunday, don't even matter 'bout the money
I'm stuck on her, never shoulda let her suck on it
Shoulda hit her up and sent her home the next mornin

[Bridge 3: T-Pain]
She got me doin, what I won't do
Got me sprung and I told you
You don't agree with me
In the end you'll see that
She got you doin, what you won't do
Now you're sprung and I told you
S-P-R-U-N-G
Now you see, she
Got you {*4X*} she
Got you {*3X*} when it all come down to her

[Hook] w/ "you do" ad libs

When it all come down to her I'm sprung
