And I can see it in my eyes won't be long
But I'm gonna drop the bomb and its goin on
Cuz for the longest the world has been waitin
So theres gonna be so many and some playa hatin
Cuz something's goin on
P.O.D.'s got it goin on

[P.O.D.]
Biographies of a capo status, rappin apperatus
Entire industry lookin at us
Memoirs of a don figga, numba one nigga
Had you on the run nigga, stackin funds nigga
We go on the road, when the you jiggy you know
Paroles in ya nose, the bigga the shows, the bigga the dough
Skeelo on the d-low, sell em like a kilo
For every gram I slam its comin back to jam
Brown skin 6'4" entrepreneur
On a six month tour, bonjour for sure
I kick down doors, dick down hoes
The P.O. giving you more than what'chu bargained for
My diamonds shine and they glisten, they glisten n they shine
Them bottom boys coming through with a raw ass rhyme
For soul and Barcelon' the biggest dome in Rome
P.O.D. got it goin on

[Hook: woman singing]
And I can see it in my eyes won't be long
Cuz something's goin on
P.O.D.'s got it goin on

[Trick Daddy]
I'm representing fo the nigga that'll get it
Got it and go wit it, wanna say they name but theres too damn many
That wanna get on this thug shit
See god for the thugs too, that's for me him n you
Go head, thug on, do ya thing boy
Its your life but don't take it for a game boy
Ain't no caviar dealer for the daddy dollaz
I'd rather eat chicken wings n collaz
Rather drive my impala, smoke and pop bottles
King of miami be chasing dollars
I be thinkin about runnin for mayor boy look here
If I win that shit change round here
First i'mma buy me a boat an' legalize dope
??? bag a weed ??? cut ??? smoke
Every nigga get high thats a change thats right
And everything in the hood be sittin on dubs
Its goin on!

[Hook: woman singing]
Cuz somethings goin on
P.O.D.'s got it goin on
Cuz somethings goin on
P.O.D.'s got it goin on

[Rick Ross]
When you wit the don sip dom, came a long way
Used to be big duns on six one
Now its all love, keep it real together
For once shit, we can eat a meal together
Squash the rumors I'm on the dock wit Cubans
Bet I ain't cop a tuna watch me move em
Rick Ross cool still spittin the hot
Had the coupe four months still missin the top
Before we leave the beach she ride dick in the drop
We pop pills in the club sip Cris on the rocks
Ya'll on the dance floor throwin bow's like Ludacris
I'm at the bar blowin loot on Cris
Respect the hot boys but we cool in the game
Put a tool in ya frame, I'm at the Eben Rock in the pool with a dame
Ask who stack the change Carol City cartel came to crack the game

[Hook: woman singing]
And I can see it in my eyes won't be long
But I'm gonna drop the bomb and its goin on
But for the longest the world has been waitin
So theres gonna be some many and some playa hatin
Cuz something's goin on
P.O.D.'s got it goin on
