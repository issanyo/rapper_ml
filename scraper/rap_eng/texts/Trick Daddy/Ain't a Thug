[Intro: Trick Daddy]
If I ain't a thug
You think I ain't a thug
Tell me what I am

[Hook: Trey Songz]
'Cause if I ain't a thug, why do I feel this way?
Why the streets stay on my mind?
Since I am a thug, why do you go get so mad?
Why can't y'all accept that it's my life?

[Verse 1: Trick Daddy]
If I ain't a thug, y'all tell me who is
How many other motherfuckers y'all know can do this?
Nigga I'm a thug forever and I never ever
Disrespect the game or cross one of my niggas
Listen, slippin' already cost one of my niggas
So I better select the fools that I be dealin' with
And I don't know nothin', didn't hear or say nothin'
I can't remember but yet, I still won't forget 'em
I'm from the dark side, born and raised in thug life
And I'm out that city full of drug dealers and wise guys
If I ain't a thug then you explain it cuz
How come a young nigga livin' so dangerous?
And why my name always somehow involved in stuff
Through all the years, y'all plan to target us
Yeah, I am thug nigga, but I ain't no drug dealer
Three time convicted felon so I oughta know better

[Hook: Trey Songz]
'Cause if I ain't a thug, why do I feel this way?
Why the streets stay on my mind?
Since I am a thug, why do you go get so mad?
Why can't y'all accept that it's my life?

[Verse 2: Trick Daddy]
From day one, I been thuggin' and I'm lovin' every minute of it
To all you critics and haters, I'm saying motherfuck ya
I don't like ya and therefore, I don't trust ya
You couldn't shut me up, now you tryna set me up
It's bad enough we had it rough when we was growin' up
You killed Pac and Biggie, now tryina kill us
But I through my 4 up 'cause I'm forever for sho
A thug rebel for certain, that's how I'm livin'
Listen, I ain't the snitchin' kind of nigga
Yo and I'm a different kind of nigga, so you busta can't hit me
Ain't no sentimental nigga, I'm sittin' on spinners nigga
And when I'm draggin' me denims don't you busta try to hit 'em
I'm from the part where stars like them heavy stars
Quality sound beatin' down each and every car
I'm givin' them hell like I'm David Chappelle
Prostitute born male, with plenty dick for sell

[Hook: Trey Songz]
'Cause if I ain't a thug, why do I feel this way?
Why the streets stay on my mind?
Since I am a thug, why do you go get so mad?
Why can't y'all accept that it's my life?

[Verse 3: Trick Daddy]
But since I am a thug, that's why you listen to me
'Cause I am a THUG officially, ya see
A lot of niggas still doubt a nigga
So when they conversatin', they be playa hatin' 'bout a nigga
But I expect them to, what else they suppose do?
They dead broke and I got more flow then they do
And they mad 'cause I don't fuck with them
Oh well, stay mad 'cause I don't kiss niggas ass
Listen, I'm too busy bein' a real nigga
So if you fuck with me, you can fuck around and get killed nigga
The truth is Mr. Dollars is the real deal
Hell, I'm the motherfuckin' Dade County mayor, yeah
And I'm strictly for the thugs
Cause I'ma show enough for 'em
Quick to straight fuck ya, nigga what
Pussy nigga what, for my motherfuckin' thugs

[Hook: Trey Songz]
'Cause if I ain't a thug, why do I feel this way?
Why the streets stay on my mind?
Since I am a thug, why do you go get so mad?
Why can't y'all accept that it's my life?
'Cause if I ain't a thug, why do I feel this way?
Why the streets stay on my mind?
Since I am a thug, why do you go get so mad?
Why can't y'all accept that it's my life?

[Outro: Trey Songz]
It's my life
If you thuggin'
If I ain't a thug
If you thuggin'

'Cause if I ain't a thug
If you thuggin'

'Cause if I ain't a thug
'Cause if I ain't a thug, why do I feel this way?
Why the streets stay on my mind?
