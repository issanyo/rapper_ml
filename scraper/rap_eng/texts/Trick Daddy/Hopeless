[Intro: Ludacris]
Ooh.. You feel that?
As I take you to them dirt roads deep down in your southern roots, where nobody said life was gon' be easy
And we travel through this emotional rollercoaster called life, and we have our ups and downs
Just keep in mind, when you hit rock bottom, there ain't nowhere to go but up, baby
Just all about how you deal with it... ya feel me?
Listen here...

[Hook: Ludacris + Trick Daddy)]
When life seems hopeless, it make a nigga lose focus
Empty beer bottles and roaches
Helps to get it off my chest, 'cause I'm so stressed
And all I hear is "FUCK THE WORLD!"
When life seems hopeless, it make a nigga lose focus
Empty beer bottles and roaches
Helps to get it off my chest, 'cause I'm so stressed
And all I hear is "FUCK THE WORLD!"

[Verse 1: Ludacris]
Man, ever since life's been a gamble, my life's been in shambles
Double-edge sword, burnin' both sides of the candle
But Cris, you can't handle the truth
Don't wanna face reality, so Lord accept my apology
Please, like when police say freeze
And I ain't do shit but I'm down on my knees
It's a crooked system, but gin straight take the pain away
I charge the game and put my problems on layaway
A black man but I feel so blue
So I smoke green and purple till my dreams come true
Then my eyes turn red, the sky turns grey
Children slangin' white in the hood, we call it yay
Drinkin' Ol' Gold down my yellow brick road
Then rewrite my script until my story's untold
See, I got a little money and my life sped up
Now I'm fallen and I can't get up

[Verse 2: Trick Daddy]
I had a dream about a dope fiend
And it's strange 'cause he can barely write or read but seems to get folks just about anything
Curious about him, I wanted to talk to him
Said he was too busy fo' that, but I was more than welcome to walk with him
So as we walked, he talked and I just listened
He said there's a big difference between crackers and niggas
He said white folks look out fo' the white folks, but uhh
Black folks blame otha' black folks when it ain't enough black roakz
When you ooh to make a long story short
We need pay more attention and do things that's way more convincin'
And he told me, you know, I wouldn't sell you somethin' that wasn't workin'
And I, damn sure wouldn't waste my time, tellin' ya somethin' that'll hurt you
But you'll fall for anything, if you don't stand for somethin', that's for certain
But niggas don't be listen, and that shit be hurtin'
Not all of us, but some of us, and if we don't hurry up
They gon' to bury each and every one of us

[Verse 3: Ludacris]
Sometimes I can't deal with my daily issues, just bein' sober
Life's a bitch and I can't control her
I wish I could and sometimes to cry on we need a shoulder
The government stand us up to run us over
And in the hood, they don't seem to understand, goddamn
What's really got me wonderin' if it's part of a bigger plan
Man I smell something fishy goin' on
It's way beyond blowin' away the smoke from all of Swishers goin' on
It ain't much I can do about it (No), but preach the word
Tell my people to spend ya money wisely, don't be absurd
Buy some things that appreciate, (Like what?) like a home
Wake up, and open ya eyes to what the fucks is goin's on
'Cause they constantly gettin' rid of us (Yup), one by one
Whether it's drugs or diseases or it's, gun by gun
I ain't no saint either, I feel I'm even doin' wrong
By usin' what's in this chorus just to get through this song

You know, y'all going to mess around and keep on complainin' about slavery, when uhh, that was over 40-50 years ago, you know, black folks need to move on
Stay strong and umm, ya'll keep playin' wit a cracker they gon' have yo ass, somewhere tied up wired up on them back roads of south Florida, Georgia
And they made the laws so them shits can't do nothin' for you
Can a church get a amen?
God for the thugs, too
Amen
