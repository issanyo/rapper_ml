[Trick Daddy}
We gon let the band deal with this...
You know we had to remix the damn thing right?
For all them bustas...
All them niggas hating on Slip-N-Slide
Sh-sh-shut up
Funk boogie remix
Sh-shut up
Deuce Pop, Ms. Trina, Trick Daddy
Sh-shut up

[Chorus]
Uh - Huh, OK. What's up?
Shut up!
Uh - Huh, OK. What's up?
Shut up!

{Verse 1: Deuce Poppito]
What's Up?  Deuce Pop I'm finna handle shit
I'm finna take Slip-N-Slide to the championship
My nigga Trick got the ball, he the quarterback
Deuce Pop got D like Warren Sapp
2-4-K we was born to mack
All that get money shit i was born for that
Throw up your middle finger if you feeling us
Coming out the cake with a million plus
Playboy that slick talk about to stop
Deuce Pop finna put the South on top
What's up, Uh-Uh, OK, bad hoes u know we don't play
That's how we do sipping on Malibu
Hennessey with the Coconut Yoo-hoo
2-4-K turn out the lights
Spit that fire burn out the mics

[Chorus]
Uh - Huh, OK. What's up?
Shut up!
Uh - Huh, OK. What's up?
Shut up!
Uh - Huh, OK. What's up?
Shut up!
Uh - Huh, OK. What's up?

[Verse 2: Trina & Trick Daddy]
Who's bad? Who's bad
Bad like this
Ain't nann hoe bad as the baddest bitch
Who's bad u know my name
It ain't been in the same since I came in the game
I'm off the chain with a figure eight frame
Everything I drop its a hit man
I risk game out to game fame
Rock the mic leaving lipstick stains
The baddest when it come to this bitch game
New coops, dicks shifts switch man
Lemme show u lame hoes how to get change
You needa take grand's, before he get brains
Get ya mind right don't be a lame hoe
Ain't shit for free, that's how the game go

Top notch, off glass, OK?!
