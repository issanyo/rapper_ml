[verse 2:]
I'm doin this one for the thugs, and them niggas on the corner every morning gettin money, yes sir, and those who died by the gun, and now they dead and gone, I'm doin this one for the deaf, the crippled, and blind, for those who went strong, and they lost they mind, I'm doin this one for the low income, the slaws, the homies, the basers, and bongs, for the good, they got to suffer with the bad, and for the mother of the child with the dead beat dad, for my lil brother who was just in the crash, now he can't feel his arms or his legs, man, I'm doin this one for the tears that were shed, for all the niggas that was sentenced to the state or the feds, to all the does who was givin they bows after talkin to the door while they homeboys told
