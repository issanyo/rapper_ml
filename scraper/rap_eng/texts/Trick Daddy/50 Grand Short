[Chorus: Trick Daddy (Sampled)]
I wanna buy me a Benz, but I'm fifty grand short
Now I got to get this cheese without the boy getting caught
I wanna buy me a Benz, but I'm fifty grand short
Now I got to get this cheese without the boy getting caught
I wanna buy me a Benz, but I'm fifty grand short
Now I got to get this cheese without the boy getting caught
I wanna buy me a Benz, but I'm fifty grand short
Now I got to get this cheese without the boy getting caught

[Verse 1: Plies]
And all the niggas I looked up to done gone Fed
And all the niggas I admired had picked bread
And I was taught that a real nigga don't beg
And these streets were never designed for the scared
The niggas who got real paper, they done took a chance
So if you're on your dick, you better not show your hand
Nigga told me I can't sell dope forever
I told that nigga I don't wanna hear shit from a broke nigga
'Cause in these streets, if you're broke, you're in the way, nigga
Fuck what you heard, I'm trying to get rich in a today, nigga
So don't talk to me about it if it don't pay, nigga
Money excite me, not hoes, okay, nigga?
And how I feel, if you're broke, you deserve to be
'Cause it's too many ways out here to get cheese
And ain't nothing come to a nigga that's sleep but a dream
And I ain't sleeping, you can put that on everything

[Chorus: Trick Daddy (Sampled)]
I wanna buy me a Benz, but I'm fifty grand short
Now I got to get this cheese without the boy getting caught
I wanna buy me a Benz, but I'm fifty grand short
Now I got to get this cheese without the boy getting caught
I wanna buy me a Benz, but I'm fifty grand short
Now I got to get this cheese without the boy getting caught
I wanna buy me a Benz, but I'm fifty grand short
Now I got to get this cheese without the boy getting caught

[Verse 2: Plies]
Wanna thank you fuck niggas 'cause y'all make me hustle harder
That's how the game go: broke today and rich tomorrow
I'm a go-getter, nigga, hustling ain't one of my problems
All the losses I done took, fuck it, I'll charge them
All that mean is the next nigga, I gotta starve them
I'ma get mine, dog, if that mean I gotta rob them
If money one of your issues, nigga, you better solve them
I'ma keep chasing this street money, I got a goldenmine
I get mine out the streets, I got blood on mine
They say the dope game, nigga, come prepared time
You might be right, nigga, but I live for right now
Forgive me, dog, fuck that, I gotta get mine

[Chorus: Trick Daddy (Sampled)]
I wanna buy me a Benz, but I'm fifty grand short
Now I got to get this cheese without the boy getting caught
I wanna buy me a Benz, but I'm fifty grand short
Now I got to get this cheese without the boy getting caught
I wanna buy me a Benz, but I'm fifty grand short
Now I got to get this cheese without the boy getting caught
I wanna buy me a Benz, but I'm fifty grand short
Now I got to get this cheese without the boy getting caught
