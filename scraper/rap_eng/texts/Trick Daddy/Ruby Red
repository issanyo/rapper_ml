Early In the mornin when im feelin low
I smoke two blunts of dro, and a cup full of lean
My girls takin pills and blow
Two lines of coke dat I cut wit drano
And her nose starts to bleed
The most beautiful ruby red

I been gettin high since back in junior high
The problems I had back then I still got 'em now
I got them worst tho, cuz I always got a sore throat
My eyes stay red, and all my clothes smell like weed smoke
I think my kids know
Man I hope my kids dont use and try some of the shit me and my parents did
I need to detox
I probably need god in my life dats why my heart ain't been beatn right
And im bout to relapse I got to get up and get out and run about 3 laps
And sit back and relax no more of that brah
Where that clean at I need to clean up my act, man I really mean that

Early In the mornin when im feelin low
I smoke two blunts of dro, and a cup full of lean
My girls takin pills and blow
Two lines of coke dat I cut wit drano
And her nose starts to bleed
The most beautiful ruby red

The most beautiful ruby red

Man the truth is, smokin is stupid and cigeretts are so ignorant
Plus they do kill you know its bad when you dont remember where you live
And its kinda sad when you dont remember shit you did
They tried to off me
Offered me coffee
One more addiction wit dis one it'll cost me
So im hollin mayday prayin for my payday
You'll still be on dat yay i'll be on my last days of A.A
I left bobby like whitney im on a whole different system
No more addiction too many headaches dey leave the heartaches
So no more chest pains dat would be da best thing

Early In the mornin when im feelin low
I smoke two blunts of dro, and a cup full of lean
My girls takin pills of blow
Two lines of coke dat I cut wit drano
And her nose starts to bleed
