Until the day a nigga D-I-E-
I'll be forever thuggin baby
Ever since I fucking
These bitches loved it baby
Still got the chron son
I used to be drug dealer
X-men, Ex-con, forever thug nigga
Around here we smoke a bitch I still book 'em heavy
Cause I bought that benz,(uh-huh)
Damn me I sold my chevy
I love my ? , I talk to 'em everyday
I ride around 'em cool, I walk be 'em yesterday
I'm from the southwest, where niggas drive chevys at
Come through with that bullshit
My niggas don't gonna handle dat
I fuck with no bustas, my game is straight must-a
So if you fuckin with us
We'll hit you up with K Cutters
I feels no niggas
But I pitch no hittas
The curve balls at they ass
They gonna watch 'em go get em
I'm now the coo guy up the street up the block from em'
I used to up my Glocks on em, then take they blocks from em'
Nigga this is thug shit, thats all I represent
You don't believe me, ask them niggas I bets they love this
Nigga this is thug shit, thats all I represent
You don't believe me, ask them niggas I bets they love this

(Chorus: repeat 2X)
When my niggas and bitches
Go from rags to riches
It'll be thug life and yall still with me
When my niggas and bitches
Go from rags to riches
It'll be thug life again, so ride wit me

(Tre-6)
(Uh-ohh)
C-O, betta known as Mr. Piscopo
Pull out my dick and piss on hoes
In ya face while I spit these flows
Like you ain't know, nigga we kick down doors to get that dough
Hit your hoes, bend your doors, smoke your dough
And we gonna get mo'
For sho', you know dat cheddar make it betta
And its thug life forever, and we all in dis togetha
Like dun-a Dun-a
Nigga dem rags to riches
Wit your boy C-O money, marching double-D so bitch don't go

So nigga rolls, so every motha fucka get down the floors
Get away from all your doors and windows
Cause a nigga done passed wit' a .44
And im'a let it go, like --boom--
Betta break ya-self, I can't take myself
But killa, nigga, won't have to make myself
And i'll come to ya wake myself
I won't send no dogs, no friends, no loot
No fool, no car, no clothes, no suit
Just a note that say, he.. through
Now, now thanks to you
Me and tre gotta make up for these times lost
We bout' that cash, we on that ass
So let them 9's off

(Chorus)
(Trick Daddy)
So mutha-fucking sicka, stupid hoes and fuck niggas
Snitches and bitches, yo hold on I'm gon' kill 'em -(CHECK)
And I'm just chillin bustas, she fought for me to keep em
So I just peep em', lay back and I book my reefa
I'm a thug nigga, so ya know I gots to keep my pistols
I got the choppers that i'll bring down and won't miss ya
You want a nigga that gives a fuck about a bitch
Unless you sucking the fucking ho and tryin' to get rich
I need a bitch that can ball a nigga out
Who can shoot a nigga best
A bitch about stacks ho
All this complaining ho, bitch about that
Ever since I hold a benz, bitch be all in my face
Nigga this is thug shit, thats all I represent
You don't believe me, ask them niggas I bets they love this
Nigga this is thug shit, thats all I represent
You don't believe me, ask them niggas I bets they love this

(Chorus)
Nigga this is thug shit, thats all I represent
You don't believe me, ask them niggas I bets they love this
Nigga this is thug shit, thats all I represent
You don't believe me, ask them niggas I bets they love this
Thug life again so ride wit me
Thug life again so ride wit me
