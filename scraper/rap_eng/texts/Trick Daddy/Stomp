Just a pine box dropped off in the woods
A man to come home, six-oh-three be like that
Catch a case and come right back

Standin out in the track with a bumma hard
Bummin weed into the sack
Nigga let the weed smoke blow
I'm intoxicated trying to make a few hits in the head
Baby, cause I be wilder, big BALLER, call up with quarter
Trying to make a few endz
Be runnin from the police, never wanna follow the Impala
