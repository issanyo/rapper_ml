Intro}
(The U) Tre-Oh-Five
(The U) Miami-Dade County
Y'all already know what time it is

We gon' let the band deal with this!

[Chorus]
Steppin' out the do' on them big body thangs 305 the city we the home team' (U already know)
We gon' turn it up
Gettin' things on deck
We the home team (u already)


[Verse 1]
You already know
When it come to crib, we all gon' go
And we gon' go fast
If you put on pads we gon' get in that ass
And I need me a ghetto hero
Get a sack like Warren Sapp
Or break records like E.J
No problem, get me a good 'cane
Ok, act like you don't know
Five national titles, we want mo'
Even knocked down the ol' O.B
R.I.P. to, Sean T
We gon' do this for you
And we already know what we got to do
Got hard and let it do what it do
Show off and then throw up the U


[Chorus]
Steppin' out the do' on them big body thangs 305 the city we the home team' (U already know)
We gon' turn it up
Gettin' things on deck
We the home team (u already)

[Verse 2]
Hey, you already know
Any history before it was already wrote
But y'all so fake that y'all gon' hate
But y'all niggas low
Like this is how it's gonna go
Ain't no way we gonna let you sco'
You'll leave here so' cuz you're way too slow
And you ain't goin pro
Started off in the Big E.T
Then they moved the beast to the A to the C's
Always on National T.V
Trust me, right here's where they wanna be
I know y'all go out to South Beach
But honestly that's way out east
From down south, to the northwest
Y'all sleep, we don't need to get rest

[Chorus]
Steppin' out the do' on them big body thangs 305 the city we the home team' (U already know)
We gon' turn it up
Gettin' thangs on deck
We the home team (u already)
