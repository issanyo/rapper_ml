[Intro: DJ Khaled]
DJ Khaled, we the best
Who, we nigga? We the best
The Runners, I represent the ghetto across the world
And you represent the hood, two hands in the sky
I'm SO HOOD, LISTENNN~!

[Chorus: T-Pain]
I'm so HOOD! I wear my pants below my waist
And I never dance when I'm in this place
Cause you and yo' man is plannin to hate
I'm so HOOD! And I got these golds up in my mouth
If you get closer to my house then you'll know what I'm talkin 'bout
I'm out the HOOD! And if you feel me put your hands up
HOO-OOD! My hood niggas, can you stand up?
I'm so HOOD! If you not from here you can walk it out (walk it out)
And you not hood if you don't know what I'm talkin 'bout
(I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm - SO, HOOD!)

[Verse 1: Trick Daddy]
E'rybody wanna motherfuckin know why, I, dress so fly, sit so high
Bitch, I do it for the hood, bitch-ass niggas I do it cause I could
Heavy starch in my jeans, fo' X in my white tees
Livin life like a G, that's why these bitch-ass niggas wanna fight me
But I ain't gon' play wit 'em, (uh-uh) - I'd rather let the AK hit 'em
Tough niggas get fucked up and put on ice for the rest of they life
I'm straight out the hood bruh, see that's what I do it for
And my low class ghetto ass, just renewed my ghetto pass

[Chorus: T-Pain]
I'm so HOOD! I wear my pants below my waist
And I never dance when I'm in this place
Cause you and yo' man is plannin to hate
I'm so HOOD! And I got these golds up in my mouth
If you get closer to my house then you'll know what I'm talkin 'bout
I'm out the HOOD! And if you feel me put your hands up
HOO-OOD! My hood niggas, can you stand up?
I'm so HOOD! If you not from here you can walk it out
And you not hood if you don't know what I'm talkin 'bout
(I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm - SO, HOOD!)

[Verse 2: Rick Ross]
YEEEAH~! Ross..
YEAH! Four-five off in the ride (ride)
Fo' blunts for me to get high (high), feel the bump when I ride by
(I'm so HOOD!) I got 'em hatin talkin like Plies (Plies)
Niggas keep droppin like flies (flies) snitchin ain't goin cut no time
(I'm so HOOD!) I murder one of you fuck niggas
Rob you for your last, the North comin mad
(I'm so HOOD!) Mo' money, mo' mayo, the llello in millions I made 'em
My Maybach is mine, my city is mine, I made it
Ross

[Chorus: T-Pain]
I'm so HOOD! I wear my pants below my waist
And I never dance when I'm in this place
Cause you and yo' man is plannin to hate
I'm so HOOD!And I got these golds up in my mouth
If you get closer to my house then you'll know what I'm talkin 'bout
I'm out the HOOD! And if you feel me put your hands up
HOO-OOD! My hood niggas, can you stand up?
I'm so HOOD! If you not from here you can walk it out
And you not hood if you don't know what I'm talkin 'bout
(I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm - SO, HOOD!)

[Verse 3: Plies]
Damn my P.O.~! Y'all can tell her I said it
Violate me if she want, gon' have to come catch me
Piss test me all you want, I'mma smoke when I'm ready
Pants hangin off me now cause my pistol heavy
(HOOD!) I ain't spoke to you yet dawg, cause I ain't friendly
I drink 'gnac homey, y'all drink Crist'
I like bust-it babies, I ont want that bougie bitch
I never buy a Phantom, 28's can't fit
They say I'm Fed bound, they call me high risk
I'mma full bloodied goon, lames make me sick
You gettin three or fo' birds where I'm from we call you rich
I'd like to the the hood homey, you taught how to rip

[Chorus: T-Pain]
I'm so HOOD! I wear my pants below my waist
And I never dance when I'm in this place
Cause you and yo' man is plannin to hate
I'm so HOOD!And I got these golds up in my mouth
If you get closer to my house then you'll know what I'm talkin 'bout
I'm out the HOOD! And if you feel me put your hands up
HOO-OOD! My hood niggas, can you stand up?
I'm so HOOD! If you not from here you can walk it out
And you not hood if you don't know what I'm talkin 'bout
(I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm - SO, HOOD!)

[Outro: DJ Khaled]
