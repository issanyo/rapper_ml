[Intro: DJ Khaled & Akon]
DJ Khaled! We the Best Season has returned!
Cause I'm out here grindin
I do this for the streets, The Runners!
Cause I'm out here grindin, hey, hey

[Hook: Akon]
I don't care what nobody say, I'mma be me (be me)
Stay hood, stay raised on the streets (cause I'm out here grindin)
Niggas talk about greatness
Whenever they speak about me (cause I'm out here grindin)
I ain't splittin nuttin with nobody
Homey I gotta get me me (cause I'm out here grindin)
I ain't slept in eight days I can go for eight weeks
Ain't nuttin to me, cause I am the streets

[Verse 1: Rick Ross]
Ricky Ross, a.k.a. Moneybags, feel me?
Put my life on the line, but I'm likely to grind
I'm on top of the game, fuck if you like it or not
That's how I get the freaks, strawberry Swisher sweets
You'll be dealin with H, when you dealin with G's
Smash it deal with the realest, shoppin like it's still December
Diplomat on the fender of the Phantom I'm the winner (winner)
I do it for the hood (hood) I do it cause you cain't (cain't)
You suckers wish you could, Ricky Ross its in the bank

[Verse 2: Plies]
Hey feds! Heard you're bringin my name up
Know you want me bad, thank I give a fuck? (Thank I give a fuck?)
Better indict me now before my price go up (up)
Came in the world thuggin, leavin with big nuts (nuts)
Yeah I run with killers homey, so what?
What you want me to tell you, I sold a lil dust?
Send your informant, I bet he leave bust
I ain't scared to go, I believe in Jesus

[Hook: Akon]
I don't care what nobody say, I'mma be me (be me)
Stay hood, stay raised on the streets (cause I'm out here grindin)
Niggas talk about greatness
Whenever they speak about me (cause I'm out here grindin)
I ain't splittin nuttin with nobody
Homey I gotta get me me (cause I'm out here grindin)
I ain't slept in eight days I can go for eight weeks
Ain't nuttin to me, cause I am the streets

[Verse 3: Lil Boosie]
I wake up to get my cake up, I'm Alton Brown
What can I say I'm a product of my environ'
Uh-oh, I'm in the game, watch me do me
Kickin these niggas Khaled man call that Bruce Lee
Summer winter spring I can't forget the fall
I still remain a dog, a diabetic and all
All I want is my paper, I don't care what they say
And stick they tongue out when they bow they head cause we the best

[Hook: Akon]
I don't care what nobody say, I'mma be me (be me)
Stay hood, stay raised on the streets (cause I'm out here grindin)

Homey I gotta get me me (cause I'm out here grindin)
I ain't slept in eight days I can go for eight weeks
Ain't nuttin to me, cause I am the streets

[Verse 4: Ace Hood]
Hey knock knock! Yeah I'm knockin on the bank do'
Three hundred million dollars and I'm droppin off the cash flow
See ye ain't heard I hit a lick, now my money right
Spend it on the U-Haul, dippin on the turnpike
Call up my dogs (dogs) brag on my face (face)
Bodies gon' fall (fall) tell em it's Ace (Ace)
If I catch a charge nigga I'mma flee the state
Hit my niggas L.A. Reid and Khaled watch me beat the case

[Verse 5: Trick Daddy]
(Hey!) You niggas fly, before you was just maggots
I'm the shit bitch, because I'm black flaggin
Yessir, the DR the new sqaud
You niggas mod and squad, we go hard
They like oh God, there go T-Double
He got his clique and his brothers, I know it's gon' be trouble
Dark boys on the black Jags
See in them black masks, now they can't stand my black ass

[Verse 6: Lil Wayne]

And weezy be the shhh like two H's after S

If Khaled say it's a movie then Weezy best actor

[Hook: Akon]
I don't care what nobody say, I'mma be me (be me)
Stay hood, stay raised on the streets (cause I'm out here grindin)
Niggas talk about greatness
