I come through stompin in my big black boots
I keep em jumpin jumpin stayin funky funky for you
Whether prada, gucci, versacci, my coochie drain in la pera
Got watches like liberacci
From my head to my stockings
I promise to rock this and keep it poppin
Ain't no stoppin me, naw, 'cause I'm on fire like a cigarette
Get higher when the beat quick nigga we hit
Shittin on niggas to heeze on em just to eat quick
Recently, I've been eliminating haters hippocrits
When they see on the street with the screaming whip
It's hard to not hate, so don't even trip, 'cause I'm chuch

[Chorus:Cee-lo and Da Brat]
If you see me when I come around (That's Chuch!)
Breakin all these hoes down (That's chuch!)
Got Cadillacs and Bentlys ahh (That's chuch!)
Got Money to the ceiling ya'll (That's chuch!)
Everywhere I go they scream (That's chuch!)
Everybody say it now. (That's chuch!)

[Verse 2: Da Brat
I'm Chuch, I'm smokin, I'm sharp, I'm hot. I'm sexy, I'm bangin, I'm sickening, I rock! I'm the hottest a hard act to follow. Never bite off more than I can chew up and swallow. If you got a problem, holla at me tomorrow 'cause I'm too busy bein the leader you follow. Nigga I'm cold blooded in a mustard color farrari. Somebody showl love me. I hope a nigga won't come out ugly shit I ain't buyin em. That's chuch! Whatever work for you. I'm so tough that I just lay all my coo. I'm so much that I only give a little to you and show you how these niggas up in Chi-town do

[Chorus]

[Verse 3:]
Like catties and furs. (Chuch!)
House in the suburbs. (chuch!)
Big ass rings and chains. (chuch!)
Big trucks sittin on thangs. (chuch!)
Daimonds and jewels. (chuch!)
Shining down on you fools is (chuch!)
Rhyming the way I do that's (chuch!)
Blindin em when I come through (chuch!)
Bling Bling that's right! Everything Da Brat-tat-tat do, you could identify that as chuch, not Church! That don't mean to da flo! That's chuch! When you got the muthafucking hat to match, nigga, That's chuch!

[Chorus 2x]
