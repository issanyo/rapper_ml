[Intro]
Yeah, yeah come on
(Baby, you make my)
Yeah, yeah come on
Yeah, yeah come on
(Baby, you make my)
Yeah, yeah come on

[Verse 1]
Each day I come in it's always somethin'
Don't stress me I'm paid like Phil Drummin
I pop like ten Cristies a day
In the spot like I'm way past risque
B R A T hard and sexy
And you can't get next to me, baby
With a blunt in my hand shit is obsolete
I don't wanna be fucked with when I cheat
It's my smoking lye, how it's supposed to be
You bitches could never get close to me
Hopefully you know not to blow my high
Impose in my zone extinguish my fire
It's my desire to blaze it up
Mad 'cause I puff I don't give a fuck
Don't come around me with no negative shit
Step up, step up and I'ma bust your lip

[Chorus]
'Cause I don't like to be fucked with when I'm high
(To the sky)
First thing you can do is make my high come down
(Down, down)
Ooh, when you make my high come down
I don't wanna be around you no more

[Verse 2]
Let's space it out, my faith is out
When I get frustrated I take it out
On the optimo so break it out
Gun me vicariously till I choke me
Make no mistake about Miss Harris stakin' out
Good cabbage lay it out
Gray for glycoma, rotten to Daytona
How to survive?
Get high all by your lonesome unless you want some company
I might pass the blunt but this bud's for me
My concentration and know nothing else
I take my problems lay 'em on the shelf
Block all the calls then shut off the cell
It's not absurd niggas get on my nerves with
Bullshit too much for this bitch
Me and my spliff don't wanna be fucked with

[Chorus]
'Cause I don't like to be fucked with when I'm high
(To the sky)
First thing you can do is make my high come down
(Down, down)
Ooh, when you make my high come down
I don't wanna be around you no more

[Verse 3]
Usually, when I split my gun down the middle
Got good weed, so strong it takes just a minute
For me to get to that place we love to go
I made this shit so you would know
When the ashes burn off
I get flashes on how you were turned off
And a big distraction, don't nobody wanna be agitated
Upset or annoyed and aggravated
Masturbation ain't stimulating as this
When it's twist, put it up to my lips and hit
Don't forget to puff, puff and pass
My blunt is stuffed up with chunks of hash

[Chorus]
'Cause I don't like to be fucked with when I'm high
(To the sky)
First thing you can do is make my high come down
(Down, down)
Ooh, when you make my high come down
I don't wanna be around you no more, no more
