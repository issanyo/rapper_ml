[Intro: Da Brat]
Yo, puttin' down, definition
Breakin' motherfuckers off proper like
And all y'all motherfuckers know what I mean

[Chorus: Da Brat]
(Ain't no thang, ain't no thang)
Puttin' it down puttin' it down ain't no thang to me
(Ain't no thang, ain't no thang)
For me to knock niggas out the box daily

[Verse 1: Y-Tee]
Get out, watch ya steps and the ol' bucksway
Fire sixteen and we bust an oozy
What side can we ride on, take off your sign or
Fire tech-9 and we bust your car right
Here's one, it bust louder than a normal gun
Here's one, fire one and fire on and on
Ambush, we have bush and we have tech psycho
Run by and rat tat tat at cha' and ya trucko

[Verse 2: Da Brat]
Bumptity bump is that shit that cha' get
When ya listenin' to the sounds of Da Brat (BABY!)
It's like that it's like that ain't no future in frontin'
So to avoid all that I keep bumpin' (AH NIGGA!)
I ain't no motherfucking joke (NIGGA!)
Step and get broke up loc
How I came in is how I'm goin' out (With a bang)
Puttin' it down, puttin' it down ain't no thang

[Chorus: Da Brat]
(Ain't no thang, ain't no thang)
Puttin' it down puttin' it down ain't no thang to me
(Ain't no thang, ain't no thang)
It's the ZZ, it's one to the two to the motherfucking three
(Ain't no thang, ain't no thang)
Puttin' it down puttin' it down ain't no thang to me
(Ain't no thang, ain't no thang)
For me to knock niggas out the box daily

[Verse 3: Da Brat]
Uh, it ain't no thang for me to lay a busta down
Buck a sucker down cause me don't fuck around
With them niggas that be fussin' on that fake shit
I'm on that ill tip nigga, you ain't heard about that real bitch
Don't push me cause I'm close to the edge
Motherfuckers wanna test me, cops wanna arrest me
But fuck that, ya get a hole in ya fuckin' head
I puts it down as a come up with a pinch of Chi
A little dash of the funk and it's funkdafied
As I combine them to get the good funkdafied
Can ya ride with this bitch from the Westside (NIGGA!)
I ain't no motherfucking joke (NIGGA!)
Puffin' on that indo smoke
How I came in is how I'm goin' out (With a bang)
Back with a motherfucking dope and man

[Chorus: Da Brat]
(Ain't no thang, ain't no thang)
Puttin' it down puttin' it down ain't no thang to me
(Ain't no thang, ain't no thang)
It's the ZZ, it's one to the two to the motherfucking three
(Ain't no thang, ain't no thang)
Puttin' it down puttin' it down ain't no thang to me
(Ain't no thang, ain't no thang)
For me to knock niggas out the box daily

[Verse 4: Da Brat]
From around the mountain, to the place that chu' call ya block
It's that nigga with no nuts but cha' still on jock
Highly (Why you) why me cause I rap tightly
And ain't no need for you to even try me
From sunrise to sunset I keeps niggas in check
It's the i-itiful, dopest individual
Who gets wreck, for all places and all races
First come, first serve basis
(Ain't no half steppin')
Cause Brat's spittin' shit like an automatic weapon
Ain't no room for no flaws in this click
(Cause the shit that we make is the funky shit)
Ya know (NIGGA!) I ain't no motherfucking joke (NIGGA!)
Step and get broke up loc
How I came in is how I'm goin' out (With a bang)
Puttin' down puttin down cause it ain't no thang

[Chorus: Da Brat]
(Ain't no thang, ain't no thang)
Puttin' it down puttin' it down ain't no thang to me
(Ain't no thang, ain't no thang)
It's the ZZ, it's one to the two to the motherfucking three
(Ain't no thang, ain't no thang)
Puttin' it down puttin' it down ain't no thang to me
(Ain't no thang, ain't no thang)
For me to knock niggas out the box daily
