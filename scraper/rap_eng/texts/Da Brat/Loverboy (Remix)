[Intro]
Yeah
Yeah, Oooh
Candy sitting in a tree
K-I-S-S-I-N-G
(Ah) Uh huh uh huh baby (x3)
I wanna (x4)
I need a (x4)
A lover (x6)
A loverboy for me

[Rap: Ludacris]
Man, is it the glitter on her breasts, or the gloss on her lips?
Hickeys on the chest, or the toss of the hips?
I'm lost in the mix, so I floss in the sea
Turning out the hits, so I'm exhausted in it

[Rap: Shawna]
Now baby it's the mo' maker, dough chaser
Now get it right, would ya, heartbreaker?
I keep it tight but I'm no faker
You can laugh now but ya'll cry later

[Rap: Ludacris]
I think I like you in ya freak clothes
Freak those, in my specialized peep shows
And then I'll make you touch ya knees to ya elbows
Toes, girl from the street of Melrose

[Rap: Shawna]
It's clear to see I like it when we smoke that
Smoke, choke that, I'm so freak (no doubt)
You kinda got me like a free when you roll out
Now get your boys from our girls, you can roll at

[Verse 1: Mariah]
I got myself a lover who knows what I like
When he invites me over I come every time
And when my sugar daddy takes me for a ride
Whatever way we go it's delirium time

[Pre-Chorus]
He's all mine and his lovin' makes me high
Like a taste of ecstasy
All I need is him to be my loverboy

[Chorus]
Loverboy, c'mon and love me
Give me more, touch me and touch me
I enjoy the way you rock me all night long
Loverboy, c'mon and take me
Only you know how to make me
Shudder with anticipation all night long

[Verse 2: Mariah]
I got myself a lover and he's so sublime
It's quite a bit of heaven to feel him inside
Cause when my sugar daddy takes me for a ride
Whatever way we go it's delirium time

[Pre-Chorus]
I get weak when his candy kisses sweet-ly
Caress my whole body
All I need is him to be my loverboy

[Chorus]
Loverboy, c'mon and love me
Give me more, touch me and touch me
I enjoy the way you rock me all night long
Loverboy, c'mon and take me
Only you know how to make me
Shudder with anticipation all night long

[Rap: 22]
Come on, yeah
Well I'm kind of innocent
A vision of love
You adore me, even though my image is thug

[Rap: Da Brat]
What I see in you is for my eyes only to see
I bring out the freak in you up and down on me
I'm your lovergirl

[Rap: 22]
Me your loverboy
But when we roam alone we come touch toys
Making noise, we can't avoid

[Rap: Da Brat]
The way I throw that
Can't pop, backdrop, stopwatch
Brat-tat, get ya more rock, hard up
All of the things you wanna do to me, you wanna
We can get obscene, my cream and you're ding-a-ling mingle
Bother me not, when the sensation come out

[Rap: 22]
Because I'll make you scream
Uh huh uh huh baby
Feel me, when I pump the pump lady
Remind me we can be close like family
You're so sweet, you taste like all types of candy
Starburst to jellybeans

[Rap: Da Brat]
Banana split my dairy queen, butterfinger my tangerines
Chickens only taste my loverboy in they dreams
Here, all my ladies let me hear you scream:
HATE ON ME AS MUCH AS YOU WANT TO
YOU CAN'T DO WHAT THE FUCK I DO
BITCHES BE EMULATING ME DAILY
(Daily)
HATE ON ME AS MUCH AS YOU WANT TO
YOU CAN'T BE WHO THE FUCK I BE
BITCHES BE IMITATING ME LATELY
(Loverboy!)

[Chorus x2]
Loverboy, c'mon and love me
Give me more, touch me and touch me
I enjoy the way you rock me all night long
Loverboy, c'mon and take me
Only you know how to make me
Shudder with anticipation all night long

[Outro]
Loverboy, c'mon and love me
Give me more, touch me and touch me
I enjoy the way you rock me
