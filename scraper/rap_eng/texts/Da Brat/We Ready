[Intro: Da Brat & (Jermaine Dupri)]
Come on then, shit
(So give it to 'em, whoa!)
Lay your head back (Whoa!)
Lay it on me (Whoa! Whoa!)
And for the money (Yeah whoa!)
You can lay that shit on me too (Whoa!)
But for now let's talk about riding
Yeah I'm saying it's like this
(Brat where are you at?)

[Verse 1: Da Brat]
You know its So So Def
Cause I'm the B to the R-A
T the most eligible bitch today
And these niggas wanna ride with a dime like me
They say they like the way the system pound in my jeep
I got two twelve's that bump from wall to wall
So loud that he headlights blink on and off
I laugh when people watch I don't stop I shine
It's attractive to motherfuckers that love to grind
I sparkle from the rims to the chain to the watch
To the rings to the ears to the wrists to the Glocks
To the parts in the braids
Shorties that stop to watch throw on the shades
Cause Da Brat got gleam for days
Sunroof open let the sun shine in
Baking the fuck out of me and all my friends
In the backseat, stay in the front
Ain't no room in the trunk
Just a devastating woofer that bump
You know!

[Chorus: Jermaine Dupri & Da Brat]
So So Def is the place and we
Ain't never gon stop
With Da B-R-A-T
We gon keep this bitch on lock
We the best at what we do
Getting paper making all the moves
And anybody that wants some
Nigga we ready for you (We ready!)

[Verse 2: Da Brat]
Uh I keep the windows down
So when I hit the stoplight
All the niggas standing around spot what they like
They shoot me the 'Come Here' finger
But the music's so loud I just smile
And act like I don't see 'em
I've done had one or too many shots of Tequila
But when it's set to crunk I need my liquor
Loud and rowdy naturally
Pull up to my truck and smile
But you ain't proud of me
I left you in the rearview with a look of disgust
And a mad mug cause your windows almost bust
I can't fathom the thought of my seats not rumbling
And people catching whiplash when I past in front of 'em
I'm flashy and I don't care if you know
From the C to the H-I-C-A-G-O
I'm fresh to death no matter how I'm dressed
It's even hard for the cops to put me under arrest
Irresistibly huggable and lovable when
I gotta wiggle myself out of the trouble I get in
I'm Da Brat officer he turned and laughed
And said stop disturbing and got an autograph

[Chorus: Jermaine Dupri & Da Brat]
So So Def is the place and we
Ain't never gon stop
With Da B-R-A-T
We gon keep this bitch on lock
We the best at what we do
Getting paper making all the moves
And anybody that wants some
Nigga we ready for you (We ready!)

[Verse 3: Da Brat]
Roll up a fat one and pass it around
Lots of niggas hear the sound now they flagging me down
Get attention when I drive by cause I'm so fly
Shorty the pimp represent the West Side of Chi
Know the haters watching
I love making 'em sick
I tear the roof off this mother like Parliament
People ride with me just to feel the bass in their chest
And be reminded of how it sounds So So Def

[Verse 4: Jermaine Dupri]
See what we do other niggas can't
That's why for ten long years
I've been making 'em dance
You know?
Me and Da Brat it's family boy
Ya know?
We ain't never gon' break down
For y'all hatin' ass niggas
We gon keep on and keep on
Ya heard? (We ready!)

[Chorus: Jermaine Dupri & Da Brat]
So So Def is the place and we
Ain't never gon stop
With Da B-R-A-T
We gon keep this bitch on lock
We the best at what we do
Getting paper making all the moves
And anybody that wants some
Nigga we ready for you (We ready!)
So So Def is the place and we
Ain't never gon stop
With Da B-R-A-T
We gon keep this bitch on lock
We the best at what we do
Getting paper making all the moves
And anybody that wants some
Nigga we ready for you (We ready!)
