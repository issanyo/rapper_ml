She, was my ace boon coon in high, we grew up together, you fucked with her i'd fight you , and vice versa, from class to choir rehearsal, totin the bags, slangin them sacks, and beat up all the hood rats, rolling off with the richest niggas on the block and bring they whips back, but things changed when I started to rap, jealousy kicked in, she wouldn??t be my friend, she wasn??t even lookin out for me then, she didn??t even have time to call me on the phone to say hello so good-bye, good-bye , you??ll never get apiece of my love again don??t try, my love is everlasting like Tony Terry , I??m very territorial and I??m over protective to niggas I love, cause I respect them, but not this heffa, she took things in a different direction, I can??t protect her when its said and done, shit, I am not the one, I need loyal buddies, supportive of me, roarin for me, breakin my trust can get ugly so please don??t mistake my kindness for weakness, learn it, as I stomp trough the trenches on this tedious journey, I??m so hot my feet burn , and you keep yearnin to be a part of my life but you done fucked it up permanently, now it don??t concern me no more
