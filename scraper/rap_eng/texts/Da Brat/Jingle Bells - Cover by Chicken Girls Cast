Jingle Bells
Jingle Bells
Jingle Bells
Jingle Bells

Dashing through the snow
In a one horse open sleigh
Over the fields we go
Laughing all the way

Bells on bobtail ring
Making spirits bright
What fun it is to laugh and sing
A sleighing song tonight

Oh, Jingle Bells, Jingle Bells
Jingle all the way
Oh what fun it is to ride
In a one horse open sleigh

We fly so high
We fly together
We are a girl gang
Like Birds of a Feather

Dashing through the snow
In a one horse open sleigh
Over the fields we go
Laughing all the way, C'mon

Jingle bells, (Jingle Bells) Jingle Bells
Jingle all the way
Oh what fun it is to ride
In a one horse open sleigh (Jingle Bells)

Jingle Bells, Jingle Bells (Jingle all the way)
Jingle all the way (Jingle Bells)
Oh what fun it is to ride
In a one horse open sleigh

Jingle Bells
