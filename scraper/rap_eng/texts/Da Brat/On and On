[Verse 1: Chanté Moore]
Ain't no telling where this love can end up
My love is stronger than pride, I'll never give it up
I'll hold on to your hand, never let go and it's going down
Wonder Woman, Super Girl, I'll be there at the speed of sound

[Pre-Chorus: Chanté Moore]
And I won't stop, and I won't stop
And I won't stop, and I won't stop

[Chorus: Chanté Moore]
And it goes on
And it goes on
The beat goes on and on
My love goes on and on
The night goes on and on
The beat goes o-o-on and on
So let it go

[Verse 2: Da Brat]
Yeah, let it go, put the pedal to the floor
I never let another mother-mother tell me no
I'm the daughter of a winner, born a go-getter
Swore to be the best since the very beginning
I been up in a lot of pain
Now I'm back in your face to put another
Back to a place where I'm doing me
Don't give a damn if you're cool with me
Back then I foolishly though that you were true to me
But you were just another hater using me
It didn't kill me, it made me greater
Now I'm more of a lover and an appreciator
Can't nobody do you like Chanté
'Cause I go on and on until the break of day
I'm the beast you made
And I must say that I'm

[Pre-Chorus: Chanté Moore & Da Brat]
And I won't stop, and I won't stop
(I won't stop)
And I won't stop
(I don't stop)

[Chorus: Chanté Moore & Da Brat]
And it goes on
(On and on and on and on and on and on and on)
And it goes on (on, on, on and on and on)
The beat goes on and on
(And the beat goes on)
My love goes on and on
The night goes on and on
The beat goes o-o-on and on
So let it go

[Interlude: Chanté Moore & Da Brat]
Yep, yep, yep
Yep, yep, yep
Yep, yep, yep
The beat goes, go-goes
Let it go, go, go-go
The beat go-go-goes
Chanté Moore in the house
Your girl B to the R.A.T
And the beat goes on
And the life goes on
Let it go

[Bridge: Chanté Moore]
Ain't no telling where this love can end up
My love is stronger than pride, I'll never give it up
I'll hold on to your hand, never let go and it's going down
Wonder Woman, Super Girl, I'll be there at the speed of sound
Sound, sound, sound, sound

[Pre-Chorus: Chanté Moore]
And I won't stop, and I won't stop
And I won't stop

[Chorus: Chanté Moore]
And it goes on
And it goes on
On and on, on and on
On and on, o-o-on and on
