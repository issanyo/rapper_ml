(J. Dupri/Big Rube)

I was thirteen, first on the block, makin' niggas jock
'Cuz before me you never saw a shorty rock (Rock)
My life did a three-sixty
Girls that didn't like me in class all uv a sudden wanna fix me
(Uhh)
I went from wakin' up early catchin' a bus
To wakin' up late sittin' in something more plush

Now no longer am I in a class full of kids
I got a one on one
Thought I was a day at the crib
Everyday was different but it didn't quit
I gotta four twenty-S and didn't have a permit
Now I was (Rich as I was rich)
I had whatever would please me
A Benz, half a million dollar house easy (And who loud)
I got the top of the world
Brauds making house calls, doin' things to me
You wouldn't belive, y'all
'Cuz I'm this, I'm that, I'm steady shaking the spot
In the position where I can't be stopped (I'm)

Young (Young) Rich (Rich) Dangerous
(I hear voices sayin')
The world is yours, nigga, get it now
Get in the game, do yo' thing and don't stop
Until it's locked down
(x2)

(Well I'm) Sittin' on top of the world
Goin' from coast to coast
Plushed out pre-votes doin' more than most...
Niggas do in their whole lifetime
See, since I was twelve
A little shorty I've been gettin' mine
Not that halfway almost dead in between
I'm talkin' 'bout this little nigga gettin' cream
Fulfillin' dreams, makin' a name for myself
Steady doin' things, learning the game gettin' wealth
I went from sittin' in the front to riding in the rear
(yeah)
I got a five-bedroom yact sittin' in Lake Le Neer
That's where, me and my crew discuss
Different ways for us to maintain in this game
And keep on kickin' up dust
Sold out shows, magazine covers (lock down)
Makin' it easier for other little shorties to rock now
It's like this (uh-huh) that's how it be (say what)
You can't predict the future without mentioning me
('Cuz I'm)

[Chorus]
Now my first name is Chris...A.K.A....Lenny ...with plenty
A millionare before i reach the age of twenty
I'm surround by a crew of niggas livin' the same
Young (young) rich and dangerous and wear anything
Earrings, rings and watches full of ice, hell-a-merchandise
Hellicopter flights to little places called "Paradise"
Where I'm surrounded by three or four women
Poolside drinkin' them drinks with the umbrella in 'em
I got the money and the power livin' it grand
In this position I could hold the whole world in my hands
Shot callin', big ballin', deal makin' I'm wanted
For then they think this is nigga here I got it all and
I'm just gettin' started and I'm deep like this
Oh, I'm destined to be the next Berry Gordy
Of this business
'Cuz I'm this, I'm that, I'm steady shaking the spot
In the position that I can't be stopped (I'm)

Young enough to make mistakes
Exposed to all forms of good and bad
The choices of many are the right choices of few
Rich enough to make mistakes in a catastrophe
It won't stop wit dollars. I'm known by millions
Rich wit knowledge and that power is dangerous
That's where your fear starts
You tryin' to come from your pocket instead of your heart
True youths come from within
The only rich man is the one who knows the value
Of life and death, danger is present when countenance is absent
Let your mind be the key to unlocking the beauty
In your hear and Godliness in your soul
Live in it or rest in it, I'm gone

[Chorus]
(Jail cell doors)
