It's da bomb
It's da bomb
I drop bombs like Hiroshima
(It's Da Bomb)
I know you hear me comin’ (here I come)
So you besta watch ya back
(It's da bomb)
I know you hear me comin’ (here I come)
And I'm called the Miggida-Miggida-Mac

(Verse 1: Mac Daddy)
Can I drop the bomb? (Drop the bomb!)
Can I drop the bomb? (Drop the bomb!)
Can I drop the bomb? (Drop the bomb!)
Well, here it comes
Say what?
Here it comes
It's the quicker gripper ripper
Known to flip a script like it ain't notin'
All ya MC's that dissed the M-A-Cs better duck an'
Run an' hide cause it's too late to try to make it right
Ya just messed up and I ain't tryin' to let ya slide
Cause I ain't the one for that I ain't the one that slack
I'm the Miggida-Miggida-Mac pack and I ain't takin' jack
I don't care who you get or who ya wit'
Just you won't be equipped to what it takes to break this Krossed Out kid
I've got dessorked out clout 'cause I'm dessorked out
I'm bad type if ya wanna know what I'm talkin about
So lay your cards on the table cause I'm able to rock
Whenever, wherever, I still rocks the cradle
Cause I’m a nappy happy bad little son-of-a-gun
And in my eyes, nigga, you don't want none
Cause on the mic I get dum-ditty ditty-dum
So watch back when I say here it comes


(It’s da bomb)
I know you hear me comin’ (here I come)
So you besta watch ya back
(It's da bomb)
I know you hear me comin’ (here I come)
And I'm called the Miggida-Miggida-Mac

(Verse 2: Daddy Mac)
Can I drop the bomb? (Drop the bomb!)
Can I drop the bomb? (Drop the bomb!)
Can I drop the bomb? (Drop the bomb!)
Well, here it comes
Say what?
Well, here it comes

(JD)
Understand that Kris to the Kross comes with nothing but flavour
We get our own on our own ain't askin for no favours
We're true to what we do that's how we be
So just reason with the D-A-double D-Y-M-A-C

(Daddy Mac)
I betcha never thought you would here it like this
Some funk for your trunk by this nigga named Kris
See, I ain't into the game
I'm true to the gang
I'm poppin' your thang till the party people swing
Cause I'm a little rough neck
Tiffy-tiffy tough neck
Causin’ what gettin' 'nough respect
And all those little punks talkin' junk bring it on
Cause I just love takin' punks out’ homes
(Why?)
Cause I'm a nappy happy bad little son-of-a-gun
And in my eyes, nigga, you don't want none
So watcha back or comments will start a runnin'
And do-do on yourself when you hear the daddy comin'

(It’s da bomb)
I know you hear me comin’ (here I come)
So you besta watch ya back
(It's da bomb)
I know you hear me comin’ (here I come)
And I'm called the Daddy Mac

(Verse 3: Da Brat)
But, can I drop the bomb? (Drop the bomb!)
Can I drop the bomb? (Drop the bomb!)
Can I drop the bomb? (Drop the bomb!)
Well, here it
Say what?
Comes
I'll be coming around the mountain when I come droppin' a bomb
Creepin' up on those Romper Room suckas who wanna get some
So feel the wrath of a brat with the Mac pack
Walkin' over you like the bottom of a door mat
I didn't gain props cause I was a suckas daughter
I had to earn them droppin' dynamite like Jimmy Walker
I can pay Donny Mars in a bird in a sticky cage
Give me 30-30 half-caliber half-gauge
And if you don't know what I'm talkin' about, test me out
We're in the big part of in The Last Boy scout
Scopin' out niggas like a needle was in a haystack
Press the new rookie breakin' rims down like Shaq
You think you're dealin' with a weak boy step back
Cause I'm comin' up like a Veteran on a phat track
I'm bein' all I wanna be so you tell Uncle Tom
Dat Da Brat done drop da bomb

(It’s da bomb)
I know you hear me comin’ (here I come)
So you better watch ya back
(It's da bomb)
I know you hear me comin’ (here I come)
And I am what they call Da Brat
