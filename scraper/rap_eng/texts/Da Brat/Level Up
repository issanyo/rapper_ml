[Hook: Mishon & Jermaine Dupri]
Levels, can't be all winners
It's levels to this shit, you gotta think bigger
It's levels to my broad, nigga
It's levels to my motherfuckin' squad, nigga
See I don't know 'bout them all, I ain't waste shawty
Just spent that half a million on you, tryna taste shawty
If you ain't happy 'bout the current situation shawty (Level up)
Quit all that talkin' nigga (Level up) and all that hatin' shawty (Level up)
See I don't know 'bout them all, I ain't waste shawty
Just spent that half a million on you, tryna taste shawty
If you ain't happy 'bout the current situation shawty (Level up)
Quit all that talkin' nigga (Level up) and all that hatin' shawty (Level up)

[Verse 1: Jermaine Dupri & Da Brat]
So sick, brand new money
Drop top, all blue hundreds
Yada yada, what's the problem
Niggas talkin' shit, ain't sayin' nothin'
Hit the gas, see me comin'
Paper tag, car 300
I'm dancin' with the stars in the roof
I'm Paul Pierce, baby I'm the truth
Been there, done that
ATL, I run that
We ain't never left this bitch
So we ain't never gotta come back
I'm at the city, where my ones at?
One at, that slick talk, that rich talk
Niggas ain't cut from this cloth and they pissed off but that's his fault
Yeah and that's the example of too much sauce
I been paid, it costs to be the boss
Way before Rick Ross
We in the city, rockin' in the city lit, look at this
Fake ass, fake titties, I don't really give a shit
Lil mama, bust it open for me and stand, do a split
Y'all niggas ain't doin' shit if you ain't doin' it like this
See I ain't never sold a brick
Hey, you ain't never make a hit
Quarter milli on the whip
Just to take a nigga bitch

[Verse 2: Mishon]
I been on the level up for so damn long, yeah
I don't even know what level I'm on, yeah
Guess this Hennessy got me in my zone, yeah
If she ain't tryna suck, don't call my phone, yeah
'Cause it's levels to this bitch
Can't sing my song 'cause there's levels to this hit
Can't do my dance 'cause there's levels to this bit
Can't sauce my faith 'cause there's levels to this drip

[Hook: Mishon & Jermaine Dupri]
