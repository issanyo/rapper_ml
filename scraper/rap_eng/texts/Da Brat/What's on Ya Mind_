[Intro]
Ay homie
Ay yo
Shit wassup with you
What...I make ya horny huh (giggle)
I make ya horny huh (giggle) shit
You act like you want some nigga.....do you?

[Verse 1: Da Brat]
Di di di da di di di da di day
I'm on the dance floor and you up on it in every way
Day to day you think of me
Can't wait to get to the club to see my face just to smoke and drink with me
The DJ keep spinnin' the hot records
Make the whole table go crazy the first second
Third I'm ready and able to hit the middle
Under that disco ball so I could shake a little
This shit for yall who dance with me
Touchin' my ass and titties so frantically
Don't get carried away with it
I'll let you have a little fun if you play with it
Insatiably, when I cum I do it patiently
Cuz if it ain't all night its a waste to me
You been chasing me for the longest time
Like Billy Joel so please tell me what's on ya mind..nigga

[Chorus]
Homie, you act like you want some
Now tell me, do I do I make ya horny huh
All up on me having a good time
I just wanna know what's going through ya mind mind mind
Homie, you act like you want some
Now tell me, do I do I make ya horny huh
All up on me having a good time
I just wanna know what's going through ya mind mind mind

[Verse 2: Da Brat]
I put my hands on the back of your fade
And we danced till the crack of dawn came
To the sun raise up its on
Still got stamina to take you home
Brat the damager managed to handle any position handed to her
You wanna fuck with the funk bandit
Leave it alone when the sweat trinkle down my cleavage you can't stand it
And you ain't even believing you dancing with Brat
And making eye contact
Homie put your hands on my waist and occassionally
Run your fingers through my fresh ass braids and say to me
That you feel horny cuz I wanna know
If you want some of this I wish you tell me so
Cuz if I let you touch me I must want you to go
Home with me be alond with me to get some mo'
Cuz we smoke we drink we bump and grind
And even though I'm tipsy I wanna know what's on ya mind

[Chorus]
Homie, you act like you want some
Now tell me, do I do I make ya horny huh
All up on me having a good time
I just wanna know what's going through ya mind mind mind
Homie, you act like you want some
Now tell me, do I do I make ya horny huh
All up on me having a good time
I just wanna know what's going through ya mind mind mind

[Verse 3: 22]
Brat now let me rock it from a niggas perspective
No chick can neglect this
Just listen when I stress this
The bitch was breathless
Big lips so thick make me wanna drop draws
Star had me rock hard shaking like a pornstar
Uh huh wassup shorty
Won't you be my sweet lover friend what homie
Thug love homie Brat put you up on pink lemonade
That's why I don't attract rats with my serinades
Stack off plubicades
Lack when it comes to brains
More than 2 women I'mma stack'em then play the game
Rack'em they love my name 22
Cuz they figure amongst themselves can I really enject 2
With my nine inch source see me climb in the nookie screaming
Everything is mine while I'm grinding the pussy
Can you picture that what's on ya mind baby push me
I don't mind raiding the jar just to get a cookie, uh

[Chorus]
Homie, you act like you want some
Now tell me, do I do I make ya horny huh
All up on me having a good time
I just wanna know what's going through ya mind mind mind
Homie, you act like you want some
Now tell me, do I do I make ya horny huh
All up on me having a good time
I just wanna know what's going through ya mind mind mind
Homie, you act like you want some
Now tell me, do I do I make ya horny huh
All up on me having a good time
I just wanna know what's going through ya mind mind mind
Homie, you act like you want some
Now tell me, do I do I make ya horny huh
All up on me having a good time
I just wanna know what's going through ya mind mind mind
