So so def
Hey shorty
How we do
Hey shorty
I'm all about that paper dough
Can you see me
You know yeah
As the clock keep ticking tick, tick gotta keep my vision bleary
I'm in a hurry to get this paper don't worry I'm a dough chaser I'm
Still living my dreams wheather its hustling, shaking
And shuffling niggas around I'm getting more greater
And its the gang shit that I ain't seen yet
And its the gang niggas I ain't meet yet
Even though I been to Paris and London and rome
Japan, Africa, Baghdad Amsterdam brought back a phat sack
And I'm rolling dem joints chrome flashing sparkling like gucci colins
When I throw on that boostey
You niggas can't stop slobbing
I'm a pretty young thug and its hotter than ever
Fucking it up so I get paid to do stuff never
When this cheddar at stake
I'm a chain billionaire blow a couple of millon
Some cars so my family and homies can ride like stars

[Chorus: x2]
I'm all about the money I don't know about you
I got places I wanna go and things I wanna do
Gotta whole lotta living to do be4 I die
And I ain't got time to waste
Honey yeah yeah
Now understand me cause its not complex
I'm young and restless with one life to
Live so I cash checks
I'm individually wrapped liked a fresh twinkie
So if I cream in the middle
Nigga licky, licky, licky, licky
Become sponge bob absorb me up
Can't just polish this I demolish the flow
Niggas astonished when I spit
When I'm pissed I let it flow
I can afford me a Bentley
Without having to forge a signature
Or getting a nigga to co sign with me
I get bored quickly so I
Sour on the g4 to Cali for more sticky gravy life
Come hop on this tour with me lets get faded for life
I used to save up cookies they are brown even
But I got rid of the whole box
And I didn't even turn the loot in'
I'm shootin' its all cause of you lame ass butlers
When I smirk if devils could talk mine would say fuck ya!

[Chorus: x2]
Its so so def
How could the cans get dropped
From the mansion to the high rise to the block we hot
I rock the white people the Latinos and foreigners
Niggas can't see me when they cry I scratch out there corniers
I'm warning ya I was born a winner
I scare crowed off like that Anna Lotono
Did right after she sang 'home in the weares
After the blizzard that's
When I came through with them frosted pieces was dripping like icicles
Keep a few of dem precious V-V-S's next to my skin
So with the best investment jems ain't no second guessing its here
Ain't not question who the best is
Take a lesson from a bitch who is the goodie in years
Never skooted in here got dem all in here
Cause dirty money spin like clean money from da A-T-M dummy
So when you done bumping your gums there's a lot of dough to be made
You should get you sum before its too late
And you left wiv none
Now its all bout the cash where ever it come from
Nigga

[Chorus: x2]
Honey if you hear me
