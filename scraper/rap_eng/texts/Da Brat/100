[Intro:]
Niggas say they wanna love somebody
Say they wanna find a lady
Talking all that bullshit
Riding around in new mercedes
Say they wanna blow that check
Then they start acting shady, no

[Pre-Chorus:]
I be whippin' in that 'rari
Yellow diamonds on my wrist
I be all up on your TV
And I got these haters pissed
CEO's wanna see me
I just scratch 'em off my list
I'm a grown ass woman
I do boss ass...

[Chorus:]
Keep it 100
Baby cause I wanna love someone
Just be honest, and tell me all that you want
100, because it's written all over your face
Why you frontin', just be honest
100, baby cause I wanna love someone
Just be honest, and tell me all that you want
100, no time for silly little games you play
Just be honest, 100

[Verse 1:]
See, I need a man to keep it a thousand
He's quick to come here, underwear browsin'
So tell me all your intentions, cuz boy my intuition
Is tellin' me something's missing
Boy you claim that you're the trillest
When you all up in them streets
But you can't be a man and keep it real with me
Tell me what you want, I know just who to be
Say you wanna wife, but really you wanna freak

[Pre-Chorus:]
I be whippin' in that 'rari
Yellow diamonds on my wrist
I be all up on your TV
And I got these haters pissed
CEO's wanna see me
I just scratch 'em off my list
I'm a grown ass woman
I do boss ass...

[Chorus:]
Keep it 100
Baby cause I wanna love someone
Just be honest, and tell me all that you want
100, because it's written all over your face
Why you frontin', just be honest
100, baby cause I wanna love someone
Just be honest, and tell me all that you want
100, no time for silly little games you play
Just be honest, 100

[da Brat (Demetria):]
Keep it 100 with me, its a long line of them and
They was wishin' they was runnin' with me
And they all find something they love about me
Get addicted to me, can't live without me
And I don't doubt for one second, hard to get on my level
I can't settle for nothing less than better
You better be ready to battle the stormy weather
And if everything shatters could you pick up the pieces
And make it all 100 again? (Could you do that?)
Or would you rather be running with your friends
Instead of celebrating a down ass woman is right here
Instead of spending all of your time doing anything
Other than making me smile from ear to ear
I ain't impressed easily, let's be clear
I need that genuine, so I could ride that pony
That pony, that pony, till the morning time

[Chorus (da Brat):]
Keep it 100 (Yeah)
Baby cause I wanna love someone (It's official)
Just be honest, (Demetria) and tell me all that you want
100, because it's written all over your face
Why you frontin', (Ay we just want y'all to keep it 100)
Just be honest (Just be honest)
100, baby cause I wanna love someone
Just be honest, and tell me all that you want
100, no time for silly little games you play
Just be honest, 100 (Be honest, honest)
One

[Outro (da Brat):]

(100 with you {x3})
