Yeah, LT
And it's the brat tat, tat y'all
And it's another album nigga
And it's so phat, phat, phat y'all
Ooh, I'm in love, I'm in love
I'm in love, I'm in love wit chu
And there ain't nothing I won't do for my baby
You drive me crazy and it makes me say
Ooh, I'm in love, I'm in love
I'm in love, I'm in love wit chu
And there ain't nothing nobody can say
'Cuz you're the one for me baby
When I wake up in the morning, it's you
When I can't sleep at night, it's you
When I'm tossin' and turning, it's you
When my body yearnin', it's you
I'm in love like Maxwell
You see me cryin' but I just can't help it
My self esteem is even higher when I'm walking with you
You give me fire and desire like Tina Marie and Rick James do
I don't care, burn up the minutes on the cell
Just turn up the music and feel it's hard as hell
I get abusive with the flows on me
When I seduce em' they just wanna hold me
'Cuz I'm so smooth and it's real not phony
Fuck with a nigga you'll never be lonely
It's been official I'm hot and since you is, let's do this
It seems I been shot by Cupid am I gonna stop, think not that's stupid
'Cuz ooh, I'm in love, I'm in love
I'm in love, I'm in love wit chu
And there ain't nothing I won't do for my baby
You drive me crazy and it makes me say
Ooh, I'm in love, I'm in love
I'm in love, I'm in love wit chu
And there ain't nothing nobody can say
'Cuz you're the one for me, baby
I'm in love wit chu more than my car, more than my house
More than the night I keep your name comin' out my mouth
If I can't get you off my mind
Finally found somebody who sees me beside what's on the out side
Fine as Roy Jones makin' a move in my bones
You presents makes everything else irrelevant when we close
Turn off the 2 way, you lay your head on my pillow
And do me baby, the rhythm gonna get chu groovin' baby
And we can rock until broad day light
Body's knockin' the boots, destroying property, poppin' me up
To get through, it ain't right, how you feeling on my booty
It's just you and me unexplanatory
The way you adore me
Lord have mercy somebody gonna have to pray for me
Your worthy, my service is superb
And on purpose I'm swerving all the way to ya heart
Ooh, I'm in love, I'm in love
I'm in love, I'm in love wit chu
And there ain't nothing I won't do for my baby
You drive me crazy and it makes me say
Ooh, I'm in love, I'm in love
I'm in love, I'm in love wit chu
And there ain't nothing nobody can say
'Cuz you're the one for me, baby
When I wake up in the morning, it's you
When I can't sleep at night, it's you
When I'm tossin' and turning, it's you
When my body yearnin', it's you
When I wake up in the morning, it's you
When I can't sleep at night, it's you
When I'm tossin' and turning, it's you
When my body yearnin', it's you
Ooh, I'm in love, I'm in love
I'm in love, I'm in love wit chu
And there ain't nothing I won't do for my baby
You drive me crazy and it makes me say
Ooh, I'm in love, I'm in love
I'm in love, I'm in love wit chu
And there ain't nothing nobody can say
'Cuz you're the one for me, baby
Ooh, I'm in love, I'm in love
I'm in love, I'm in love wit chu
And there ain't nothing I won't do for my baby
You drive me crazy and it makes me say
Ooh, I'm in love, I'm in love
I'm in love, I'm in love wit chu
And there ain't nothing nobody can say
'Cuz you're the one for me, baby
Ooh, I'm in love, I'm in love
I'm in love, I'm in love wit chu
And there ain't nothing I won't do for my baby
You drive me crazy and it makes me say
Ooh, I'm in love, I'm in love
I'm in love, I'm in love wit chu
And there ain't nothing nobody can say
'Cuz you're the one for me, baby
