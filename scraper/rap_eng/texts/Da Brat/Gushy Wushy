You can find me in a cloud of smoke
Usually I'm posted up in the corner with mah folks
Surrounded by thugs and models
Everybody getting fucked up and we all gotta bottle
Ain't nobody stuck up cuz we all wanna holla
We all wanna party till tomorrow
Lets follow the yellow red road to mah humble of bowl
Trip over the ninety way take off all of our clothes
Kiss most of me right away because I'm about to explode
And if you don't know, know you know
Nigga I'm sickning and I never get with
When I retire I'll be crushed up like a old battle ship
I'ma put the dip in your hip from right to left
It's that ghetto ass bitch and I'm so so def
It could get drastic don't fuck around and get ur ass kicked
Cuz I have never been faithfully uplasted

[Chorus]

Ima bout to bust all you motherfuckaz (just a lil)
Don't touch me cuz you get fucked up (just a lil)
Where the party at I'm tipsy nigga (just a lil)
When it comes to the doe I'm filthy nigga (just a lil)
Can I get in and rock it (just a lil)
Can I get this dirty money lagit (just a lil)
Can I make you wanna kiss on my kitty (just a lil)
Just get down to the nitty griddy gushy wushy sticky icky

In the club in the heat in the V.I.P
Sippin on bub? lighten up a tree
Its tight enough the place for me so I tight on doves?
Security still had to squeeze niggeaz like chokin on doves wit me
Smokein on mah chronic cuz it's straight from cali
If I'm provoking you do do cuz I gotta do weed
Stay focused on the doe wit mah family
I need to live all good, I need to sleep all good
I need to know who the niggas in mah neighborhood, in mah neighborhood
So shit if anything happens if sumthin goes down
Im getting ready for the motherfuckin show down
And theres no telling wut I do cuz I know more now
I just might turn it ovea to mah crew and roll out
Cuz imma kool bitch breeze through the bullshit
Be eazy cuz I keep me focused

(chorus)

Ima bout to bust all you motherfuckaz (just a lil)
Dont touch me cuz you get fucked up (just a lil)
Where the party at I'm tipsy nigga (just a lil)
When it comes to the doe I'm filthy nigga (just a lil)
Can I get in and rock it (just a lil)
Can I get this dirty money lagit (just a lil)
Can I make you wanna kiss on my kitty (just a lil)
Just get down to the nitty griddy gushy wushy sticky icky

If you want drama I'm from the Chi, Illinois
Going wit the docomentry on mah boys
Some of them cold killaz doe killaz
Murda their babysiter gold realistic do whatevea for their lil sista
Four g's folks low ..?.. oh please
No matter what city I'm in I get wut I need
Niggas think they love me cuz I'm the b to the r-a-t
Every second is appropriet for me to bust and discuse
Whatever the fuck I wanna bring up and string up
My a f one laces would you niggeaz stay out of our faces
My team winning like the L.A lakers my cron peepz
Spinning on a navigator when I stop niggeaz there they can't take it
It took mah moma nine months to make it ain't no mistakein

(chorus)

Dont touch me cuz you get fucked up (just a lil)
Where the party at I'm tipsy niggea (just a lil)
