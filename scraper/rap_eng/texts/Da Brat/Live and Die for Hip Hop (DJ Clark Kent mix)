(Verse 1: Mac Daddy)
I devoted my whole life to rockin' mics gettin crowds lifted
Put my pants on backwards caus' I wanted to be.... different
I keeps'em with a crease tom peeps burn to nucci, house
Full of hunnies sportin' gucci, cuttin' coochie
I'm the man girlfriend, luxury I swim
Macadocious to the most brown sexy, slim
Setter of trends, known for making dividends and millions my people jump, jump, jump, jump

(Verse 2: Da Brat)
Who chose to be the next nigga to step get deleted by death Undefeated ain't no thang to put that body to rest
Chest filled with smoke yokin' niggas up by the collar
Follow me cuz my dollars makin' more cents than common
Robbin' you for your money and your diamonds
Endangerin' your species
More like a woman than the bee gees
No remorse steady smokin' plenty grass let it go
And let Da Brat commence to be the baddest hoe

(Hook: Mac Daddy)
Well baby roll me a mic and let me smoke til' I'm high
If you ever seen me rock than you know that I
Live and die for the things I do slang I use
Breakin' down mics and destroyin' crews

(Hook: Da Brat)
Well nigga roll me a mic and let me smoke til' I'm high
If you ever seen me rock than you know that I
Live and die for the things I do slang I use
Breakin' down mics and destroyin' crews

(Verse 3: Daddy Mac)
Nothin' but a C big parties (twelve until)
See I'm the daddy of the mac and at the top of world I chill keep real
My feela' work consists of that
(a thuggish ass niggas sayin' way to keep 'em pissed) my life
I wouldn't tread it, to me it's nothin' better
Wakin' up when I wanna
Sportin' Jay-boogie leather autographs (bubble baths) five star hotels
Rollin' wit' a clicc supa' thick and everybody gettin' well

(Verse 4: Mr Black)
Take off the safety face me gun powder chowder for real
The last nigga figure to ever make it off the hill with steel
Rhymes rock like Cope the smoke
And I'm in effect with a tech that got a infa-red scope
Smackin' those actin', tough as Tinactin
Fall up in your hood increase your brain with the Mac-10
Stacked N's seventeen's on the benz
And burn up on my thigh in case these niggas won die

(Hook: Daddy Mac)
Well baby roll me a mic and let me smoke til' I'm high
If you ever seen me rock than you know that I
Live and die for the things I do slang I use
Breakin' down mics and destroyin' crews

(Hook: Mr Black)
Well nigga roll me a mic and let me smoke til' I'm high
If you ever seen me rock than you know that I
Live and die for the things I do slang I use
Breakin' down mics and destroyin' crews

(Breakdown: Aaliyah)
Oooooooooooohhhhhhhh........ Someone tell me.........
We got it goin' on...... I'm tellin' y'all (it's that SoSo Def)

(Verse 5: JD)
I want you to feel me, my whole thang is to get inside your body
I run game like my name was John Gaddy
Hittin' hookshots like Vlade and niggas around my way call me little Liberace
A lady lover like no other
And I be lethal with my weapon so they call me Danny Glover
Now who keep it hot? (We do!)
See So So def ain't nothin' but a fool ass crew
