Uh
And that's the story, no life no more, just the loss
Caught up in between the negative and positive force
Carmen Brown, sad tale of a life cut short
Who will take the responsibility when the guns go off?
On one side you have Hill, he got to live with the guilt
Is he the one that she needed or the one that got a kill?
Or is it Carmen to blame for her own downfall?
Did she play with his heart and never loved him at all?
It doesn't matter now because she is resting in peace
And all the playas in the game have to live with the grief
It's only now that she's gone, you will truly discover
The Immortal Beloved Carmen Brown, there never be another
