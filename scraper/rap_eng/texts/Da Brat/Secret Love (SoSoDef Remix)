And baby, it's tearin' me apart (Yeah)
Cuz I want the world to understand
That I love you and you are my man (Uh huh)
Baby, we know that we belong
A love that is real just can't be wrong
Can't keep it inside for very long
This love is too strong
So, when you're not here, I got (Yeah, yeah, yeah)

When I feel inside strong enough to bust
Open up the hard, the hardest thug
Hop on his wood when he need love, can't hide
They see me shine when I ride this (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Let's blow quiet reminds just you and I boy (Yeah, yeah, yeah)

Repeat 1 to end
