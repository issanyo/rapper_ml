[Intro]
Don't let no one dim your light!
Don't let no one dim your light!

[Verse 1]
Yo! I ain't finna let nobody dim my light
I ain't finna mess around with these hoes, 'cause they ain't friends, they foes
Ain't got no heart or soul, try to come for me and I zone out
I make 'em uncomfi one
I keep my head up
Commissary bread up
I got connection in kitchen, I stay fed up
Enough is enough, I'm close to the edge, I'm 'bout to jump
They took away my freedom, 'cause I'm not a punk!
But it is what it is, the only one sufferin' is my kids
So I filed enough peered, when I close me eyelids
I think about what I did, when I did, what I did
Ain't no tellin' when I might see my kids
I keep tellin' myself; "Shout like it is!"
But it ain't tho
Play 'cause I used to go
Now I can't go! Whippin' it in the Bentley, countin' bankrolls!
Them memories gone
I'm so defienetly the one I wish they wanna send home, I'm Jezzie!

[Chorus]
Take errthing out yo hand and put them in the air
And highfive your neighbor and say I'm stil here
'Cause this is yo life
So don't let no one dim your light!
Take errthing out yo hand and put them in the air
And highfive your neighbor and say I'm stil here
'Cause this is yo life
So don't let no one dim your light!
Don't let no one dim your light
Don't let no one dim your light

[Verse 2]
48 laws of power, don't ever try to outshine a master
It won't make yo time move faster
We honor the system, established to build a friction
And design the work against 'em, but i still climb
Even tho the fence is barb wired
Nails in my hands, left hangin' out to dry
I cry, and laugh like it's no tomorrow and give God back what I borrow
We all up in here
Competition where?
We might as well uplift one another and stop livin' in distance Whether you like it or not we all sistas
Prayin' with the same repintence  and need forgiveness
My sentence is just a fragment
I'm incomplete if I ain't got a pen and a pad, man its history!
Pull a yet her story
At least I'm still alive and I'm givin god the glory, thank you!

[Chorus]
Take errthing out yo hand and put them in the air
And highfive your neighbor and say I'm stil here
'Cause this is yo life
So don't let no one dim your light!
Take errthing out yo hand and put them in the air
And highfive your neighbor and say I'm stil here
'Cause this is yo life
So don't let no one dim your light!
Don't let no one dim your light
Don't let no one dim your light
