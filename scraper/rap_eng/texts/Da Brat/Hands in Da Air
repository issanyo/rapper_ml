Niggas always watchin' me
(Funky)
But I want 'em to keep on watchin' me
I'ma keep give 'em sumthin' to see
(Smokin')
I always feel like
Somebody's watchin' me, watchin' me
Could it be the way I'm still tight?
Niggas that didn't use to feel me jockin' me, jockin' me
The, whole world got too much money for me
To not get no dough, dough, can't no hoe
Rock harder than the one from so-so
I never go broke, broke
I keep comin with the vocals that make most know
Why the fuck I boast, boast and brag
Why should I look sad that I got some loot now?
In fact, I knew how
Watch when I back the Coupe out
Can niggas just troop out?
The same way they do when I show you Brat
With a little bit of boobs out
And her big ass protrude out
Get the news out
Some of you bitches lose out
When the sexiness ooze out
Like orgasms, I'm the best at this
Throwin' tantrums when I move into makin' shit
If you thinkin' of becomin' one of my favorites
You gotta pay a bitch 'cause I be stayin' rich
I ain't quittin', quittin'
Way before, "Funkdafied" I was spittin', spittin'
Throw yo' hands in the air like you don't care
This fo' niggas and bitches everywhere
Forever you playas playas flash on 'em
Get cash on 'em
And make 'em say, say
Hands in the air, from side to side
Forever I'm high, high
Together we ride, ride
I'm never too tired to get that paper, baby
If y'all wanna see me, see me
I'm give y'all somethin' to look look at
Make a nigga neck turn turn for Brat
Burn burn these hoes 'cause I'm back and my pants still sag
It's automatic, they wanna jump on my wagon, wagon
I ain't lackin', lackin' on shit
Open ya eyes when my body when I try on clothes that fit fit
I'm articulate and particulate on who I let hit hit
And get up in the middle of the center of my tootsie roll
Roll me something to smoke smoke and burn slow slow
Don't keep it a secret, tell all ya folks
See you when I shine, I glow, glow
From the C H I C A G O, 60644
And I trust no, nigga that make a mistake for me
Guns ready to blaze and to leave with you
Some of the ones run
I can't control my trigger finger when it pump, pump
Stay out the way when I come come
It's guaranteed to bump, bump the trunk, uh
And put a hump in ya back
If niggas is askin' who's thumpin', it's Brat Brat
Throw yo' hands in the air like you don't care
This fo' niggas and bitches everywhere
Forever you playas playas flash on 'em
Get cash on 'em
And make 'em say, say
Hands in the air, from side to side
Forever I'm high, high
Together we ride, ride
I'm never too tired to get that paper, baby
I keep my bad braids back when puttin' the dick on the track
You can turn it down playa, we don't listen to that
The bass don't thump, we spit on crap
That beat ain't tight nigga, that shit ain't fat
Every time that shit come out, I toss it back and I slap
I be breakin' ya back to the rhythm of rap
[Unverified] test it loud for the low frequency, where it's at?
Niggas say, "I love that fuckin' shit ya did wit Da Brat!"
Actin' bad with the pad, with the pen, with the paper
Still smoke a nigga under the table
Put the lines in the words and the hooks and the phrases
Instead of puttin' out sumthin' that's blazin'
Get ya hand out my pocket, get ya foot out ya mouth
And ya head out ya ass
And keep ya nose out my business
And I mean it, goddammit, 'cause I'm fiddinta get mad
I put 'em in the trash bag
Twist tie, put 'em out Monday and Wednesday
I kick 'em in they raggely ass
Take money from 'em and you know I better get some
I know it ain't fair
But I smoke with alligators and I wrestle with bears
Throw ya hands in the air
As high as you can and leave them bitches there
Throw yo' hands in the air like you don't care
This fo' niggas and bitches everywhere
Forever you playas playas flash on 'em
Get cash on 'em
And make 'em say, say
Hands in the air, from side to side
Forever I'm high, high
Together we ride, ride
I'm never too tired to get that paper, baby
Throw yo' hands in the air like you don't care
This fo' niggas and bitches everywhere
Forever you playas playas flash on 'em
Get cash on 'em
And make 'em say, say
Hands in the air, from side to side
Forever I'm high, high
Together we ride, ride
I'm never too tired to get that paper, baby
