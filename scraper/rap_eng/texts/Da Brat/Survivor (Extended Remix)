[Intro: Da Brat]
Welcome to the wonderful world of Destiny's Child
I'm the Brat-tat-tat
My homeboy Den on the track
And we gonna lay you flat on your back
With the beat-boom-boom-pat-pat like that, y'heard me?
Now we comin' into this game like some survivors
And we leavin' this game like some survivors
So from now until we dead and gone we gonna be some survivors
Y'heard me? Beyonce where you at?
Uh!

[Verse 1: Beyonce]
Now that you're out of my life, I'm so much better
You thought that I'd be weak without you, but I'm stronger
You thought that I'd be broke without you, but I'm richer
You thought that I'd be sad without you, I laugh harder
You thought I wouldn't grow without you, now I'm wiser
Thought that I'd be helpless without you, but I'm smarter
You thought that I'd be stressed without you, but I'm chillin'
You thought I wouldn't sell without you, sold 9 million

[Hook: Destiny's Child]
I'm a survivor (What?), I'm not gon' give up (What?)
I'm not gon' stop (What?), I'm gon' work harder (What?)
I'm a survivor (What?), I'm gonna make it (What?)
I will survive (What?), Keep on survivin' (What?)
I'm a survivor (What?), I'm not gon' give up (What?)
I'm not gon' stop (What?), I'm gon' work harder (What?)
I'm a survivor (What?), I'm gonna make it (What?)
I will survive (What?), Keep on survivin' (What?)

[Verse 2: Beyonce]
Thought I couldn't breathe without you, I'm inhaling
You thought I couldn't see without you, perfect vision
You thought I couldn't last without you, but I'm lastin'
You thought that I would die without you, but I'm livin'
Thought that I would fail without you, but I'm on top
Thought it would be over by now, but it won't stop
Thought that I would self destruct, but I'm still here
Even in my years to come, I'm still gon' be here

[Hook: Destiny's Child]
I'm a survivor (What?), I'm not gon' give up (What?)
I'm not gon' stop (What?), I'm gon' work harder (What?)
I'm a survivor (What?), I'm gonna make it (What?)
I will survive (What?), Keep on survivin' (What?)
I'm a survivor (What?), I'm not gon' give up (What?)
I'm not gon' stop (What?), I'm gon' work harder (What?)
I'm a survivor (What?), I'm gonna make it (What?)
I will survive (What?), Keep on survivin' (What?)

[Verse 3: Kelly Rowland]
I'm wishing you the best
Pray that you are blessed
Bring much success, no stress, and lots of happiness
(I'm better than that)
I'm not gon' blast you on the radio
(I'm better than that)
I'm not gon' lie on you and your family
(I'm better than that)
I'm not gon' hate on you in the magazines
('m better than that)
I'm not gon' compromise my Christianity
(I'm better than that)
You know I'm not gon' diss you on the internet
Cause my mama taught me better than that

[Hook: Destiny's Child]
I'm a survivor (What?), I'm not gon' give up (What?)

[Verse 4: Da Brat]
Uhh, c'mon, uhh
Now I done been through the storm and the rain
Climbed up the rough side and got tougher times, but I remain
Ya buff out the stuff to shine, And pull out the pump, protect mine
Survive in the game, Hate on me cuz you lame
They don't ever see your face or say your name
No more pain for me, No more misery, cuz you history
Imma hold on to what I got, Strap on my perfection, strap on protection
My own direction, born to be the best at what I do, I'ma make it through
Stompin like a soldier in my big black boots
I keep 'em "Jumpin, Jumpin," stayin funky, funky for you
No matter who's that man who walk out of your life
You don't need him, don't be no heathen
Long as I see you breathin', not leavin' for no reason
Seen 'em come and go once rich, they now po
No house, no mo, not even a condo
As long as I know how to love Imma stay alive, no need your game or style
They can't tame me cause I'm wild, not ashamed of stayin down
Can the rain sit, and on things chromed out, spit
And in my game, no doubt, I'ma get paid in a big way, survivor!
