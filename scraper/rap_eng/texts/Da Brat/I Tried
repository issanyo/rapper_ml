[Verse 1:]
I'm sittin' home on a cold day
Underneath the covers like a little baby
I think I wanna hear some Coldplay
Especially that song when that man says:
"Did I drive you away? (yeah)
I know what you'll say"
Ooh, whoa, whoa
I know all about your ways

[Pre-Chorus:]
What you do when you're gone (what you do)
And I knew all along (I knew)
But they say people change
So I turn and look the other way

[Chorus:]
I tried to be blind to your game (tried)
Deep down I knew you wouldn't stay around (oh)
I should have left your side in the first place
But I thought I'd be cool when you would be around (when you)
I tried to be blind to your game (yeah yeah)
Deep down I knew you wouldn't stay around (ooh I knew oh)
I should have left your side in the first place (should have)
But I thought I'd be cool when you would be around

[Verse 2:]
All I can see is your old face
Giving my love away at some woman's place
Maybe I should I get up and go wash my face
Cryin' never kept you at home anyway
Did I drive you away? (No I didn't but you said it)
I know what you're saying
Ooh, whoa, whoa
I know all about your ways

[Pre-Chorus:]
What you do when you're gone (what you do when you're gone)
And I knew all along (I knew all along)
But they say people change (say people change)
So I (so I ) turned and looked the other way

[Chorus:]
I tried to be blind to your game (tried to be blind yeah)
Deep down I knew you wouldn't stay around (deep down I knew inside oh)
I should have left your side in the first place
But I thought I'd be cool when you would be around (I tried)
I tried to be blind to your game (I tried to be blind)
Deep down I knew you wouldn't stay around (but I knew it)
I should have left your side in the first place (oh)
But I thought I'd be cool when you would be around

[Bridge:]
I noticed it
The calls you get
Leavin' the room and sh..
And I knew you had a bitch
And I hated it
That's what I get
(Ooh)
I noticed it
The calls you get
Leavin' the room and sh..
And I knew you had a bitch
And I hated it (yeah)
That's what I get

[Chorus:]
(What ya doing to me baby)
I tried to be blind to your game (oh)
Deep down I knew you wouldn't stay around (deep down)
I should have left your side in the first place (oh I should have left your side)
But I thought I'd be cool when you would be around (oh)
I tried to be blind to your game (yes I tried)
Deep down I knew you wouldn't stay around (ooh I knew)
I should have left your side in the first place (oh)
But I thought I'd be cool when you would be around (yeah thought I'd be cool)

[Chorus:]
I tried to be blind to your game (yeah yeah yeah)
Deep down I knew you wouldn't stay around (ooh)
I should have left your side in the first place (yeah yeah yeah)
But I thought I'd be cool when you would be around (oh)
I tried to be blind to your game (oh oh I tried)
Deep down I knew you wouldn't stay around (ooh I knew)
I should have left your side in the first place (ooh)
But I thought I'd be cool when you would be around

[Outro:]
I thought I'd be cool
I thought I'd be cool
I thought I'd be cool
