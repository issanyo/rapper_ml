[Intro: Kelly Price]
Hmm, wonderin' where you been, baby, baby

[Chorus: Kelly Price]
I've been wonderin' where you've been sleepin'
(I wanna know, I wanna know)
We've been runnin' out of time
Cause you wanna be creepin', pimpin'
(You've been runnin' around creepin' and pimpin' baby)
I've been sittin' home alone at night
I've been cryin' (oh)
We've been runnin' out of time
(Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, hey)
Tired of your lying

[Verse 1: Da Brat]
Uh, uh
Really though how much time you think I got?
The clock is ticking, it's ticking away
You're slippin' away fucking the honeys on the block stop
Cause if I gotta drop kick a ho, I'll kill her fa'sure
Let's stick around till the murderer curse
How you gonna creep with me and sleep with her?
At the moment of time
When I heard the news, my vision must have been blurred
Cause I ain't think you deserve to lose the nerve for fools
Shit people were saying was absurd to me
But I certainly never thought you would take it to the degree
Of hurtin' me, purposely
We were supposed to be husband and wife
So I dedicated myself to you
Why? So you could keep a chick on the side
Cause if I sneak a dick on the side you lookin' to die
And booking me a ticket to Chi cause you choose to lie
I need a nigga with an attitude, maturative mind
Give me gratitude when I'm giving him shine
No matter who the bastard was I was passed his love
But he never ran fast enough
I'm a master at the craft cause I roll with some master thugs
Laughin' as I pass you up
Should've told me that you wanted to get ass and fuck
I would've set it up so we all had some fun
You assist to get around
I'll be the aid and assist you to get out
Thank them hoes cause you're shit out of luck
And I don't regret what I spit out and bust
I'm sick and tired of you, us
I'm tired of sittin', cryin' and being alone
Nigga if you want to roam the streets then just let me be
There's a whole gang of niggas that wanna hit my sheets

[Chorus: Kelly Price]
I've been wonderin' where you've been sleepin'
(Come on baby yeah)
We've been runnin' out of time
Cause you wanna be creepin', pimpin'
(I've been yeah)
I've been sittin' home alone at night
I've been cryin'
(Not gonna cry no more, baby no)
We've been runnin' out of time
Tired of your lying
(Yeah you've been lying, lying baby)

[Verse 2: Da Brat]
Shit all I ever did was wait and look out the window
And smoke me some endo
It drove me to drinkin' and getting bent mo'
Gave myself 100% more time to think
Was love designed to stink?
Repeatedly you lied to me
Told you to confide in me
Ain't nothin' them other hoes could do
Cause I molded you
To fit properly was inside of me
When you're strokin' them
You're thinkin' of riding me
And most of them hopin' to slide with me
Cause I'm a ferocious hoe
When it comes to freaky shit the dopest
You had to blow this
It's all out of proportion and lost your focus
Wasting my time cause I'm just getting older
You're the reason I keep a chip on my shoulder
44 in the holster bulletproof vest under my clothes
I'm supposed to trust you
Every time I leave town I bust you, fuck you
The moaning and groaning
Led me to the pillow where you laid you head
Felt like I'd rather be dead instead
Went ahead followed the sound through the hallway
You said you'd always be true
But the neighbors say the bitch was there all day with you
That's why you ain't answered when I was paging you
I hit the door, you duck and dove
She tried to find her clothes
Y'all was dodging bullets holes together
You gonna stay with that broke hefer
You know who the So So Defest is
I ain't gotta show a motherfucker breastesses
To keep 'em interested in
You better recognize the good investment
From the West Side of Chi nigga

[Chorus: Kelly Price]
(I've been)
I've been wonderin' where you've been sleepin'
(Said I've been wonderin' where you've been)
(Wonderin' where you've been)
We've been runnin' out of time
(We've been runnin', runnin' out of time)
Cause you wanna be creepin', pimpin'
(Cause I'm tired of lies baby)
I've been sittin' home alone at night
(Don't wanna be alone)
I've been cryin'
(Don't wanna be alone, no, no)
We've been runnin' out of time
Tired of your lying (yeah)

[Outro: Kelly Price & (Da Brat)]
(2000)
I've been wonderin' where you've been sleepin'
(AP hit me on the trizzack, deuce, deuce ya know?)
We've been runnin' out of time
Cause you wanna be creepin', pimpin'
I've been sittin' home alone at night
I've been cryin'
We've been runnin' out of time
Tired of your lying
You're outta time, you're outta time, you're outta time
(Whoo! And I'm running out of breath)
