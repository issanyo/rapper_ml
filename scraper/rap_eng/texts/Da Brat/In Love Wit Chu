[Chorus]
Oooooh I'm in love, I'm in love, I'm in love, I'm in love wit chu
And it ain't nothin I won't do for my baby
You drive me crazy and ya make me say
Oooooh I'm in love, I'm in love, I'm in love, I'm in love wit chu
And it ain't nothin nobody can say cuz you're the one for me baby

[Da Brat]
When I wake up in the mornin (It's you)
When I can't sleep at night (It's you)
When I'm tossin and turnin (It's you)
When my body yearnin (It's you)

[Da Brat]
I'm in love like Maxwell, you see me cryin but I just can't help it
My self esteem is even higher when I'm walkin wit chu
You give me fire and desire like Tina Marie and Rick James do
I dont care burn up the minutes on the cell
Just turn up the music and feel it as hard as hell
I get abusive with the flow zone deep
When I seduce em they just wanna hold me
Cuz im so supa and It's real not phony
With it youll neva be lonely
Its been official I'm hot
And since you is lets do this
I'ts seems ive been shot by cupid
And I'm gon stop, think not thats stupid cuz...

[Chorus]
Oooooh I'm in love, i'm in love, I'm in love, I'm in love wit chu
And it ain't nothin I won't do for my baby
You drive me crazy and ya make me say
Oooooh I'm in love, I'm in love, I'm in love, I'm in love wit chu
And it ain't nothin nobody can say cuz you're the one for me baby

[Da Brat]
I'm in love wit chu more than my car
More than my house
More than the night I keep yo neck comin outta my mouth
I can't get you off my mind
Finally found somebody who sees me besides whats on the outside
Fine as Roy Jones, think ya movin my bones
Yo presence makes everything else irrelevant when we close
Turn off the 2-way you lay your head on my pillow and do me baby!
The rhythm on ya get yo groovin baby!
And we can rock it till the broad daylight
Bodies knockin the boots destroyin property
Proppin me up to get through it ain't right
How ya feelin on my boooty It's just yooouu and me
Unexplanatory the way that you adore me
Lord have mercy somebody gon have to pray for me
I'm worthy my service superb
And on purpose im swervin all the way to your heart

[Chorus]
Oooooh I'm in love, I'm in love, I'm in love, I'm in love wit chu
And it ain't nothin i won't do for my baby
You drive me crazy and ya make me say
Oooooh I'm in love, I'm in love, I'm in love, I'm in love wit chu
And it ain't nothin nobody can say cuz you're the one for me baby

[Da Brat] - 2X
When I wake up in the mornin (It's you)
When I can't sleep at night (It's you)
When I'm tossin and turnin (It's you)
When my body yearnin (It's you)


[Chorus]
Oooooh I'm in love, I'm in love, I'm in love, I'm in love wit chu
And it ain't nothin i won't do for my baby
You drive me crazy and ya make me say
Oooooh I'm in love, I'm in love, I'm in love, I'm in love wit chu
And it ain't nothin nobody can say cuz you're the one for me baby
