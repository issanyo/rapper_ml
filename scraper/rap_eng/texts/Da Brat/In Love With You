When I wake up in the morning it's (You)
When I can't sleep at night it's (You)
When im tossin and turning its (You)
When my body yearnin it's (You)
Im in love like Maxwell
You see me cryin but I just can't help it
Myself esteem is even higher when im walking with you
You give me fire and desire
Like Tina Marie and Rick James do
I don't care burn up the minutes on the cell
Just turn up the music and feel its hard as hell
I get abusive with the flows on me
When I seduce em' they just wanna hold me
Cuz im so smooth and it's real not phony
With a nigga you will never be lonely
Its been official im hot
And since you is, lets do this
It seems I been shot by cupid
Am I gonna stop, think not that's stupid cuz . .

[And there ain't nothing nobody can say cuz you're the one for me] (Baby)
Im in love with you more than my car
More than my house
More than the night I keep your name comin out my mouth
I can't get you off my mind
Finally found somebody who see me instead what's on the out side
As fine as Roy Jones
Makin a move in my bones
You presents makes everything else irrelevant when we close
Turn off the 2-way
You lay your head on my pillow
And do me baby
The rhythm gonna get chu groovin baby
And we can rock until broad day light
Body's knockin the boots
Destroying property, poppin me up to get through
It ain't right the way you feeling on my booty
Its just you and me
Unexplanatory the way you adore me
Lord have mercy somebody gonna have to pray for me
Your worthy, my service is superb
On purpose im swerving all the way to ya heart
Ooooh
Im in love
Im in love

Im in love with you
[And there ain't nothing I won't do for my] (Baby)
[you drive me] (Crazy)
