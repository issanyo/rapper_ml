FREE AGENTZ!

I was sitting at the table, V.I.P., inebriated
Got so many bottles round me' Got me six thousands in the '80s
So I keep myself surrounded by some moguls making paper
If you're lame, I can't fuck with you
Cause you are no motivator!
Ladies love me, boys adore me
I mean even the ones that never saw me like
You're so cool, you're so cute
You're so uh, I wanna roll with you!
Gimmie the digits and I'll sing you a text
I'll let you know what's next, what's next, what's next?
Follow the leader who for years been giving you heaters
You'll be a masochist in the'

If we're off in the club looking at each other
Somebody about to go home
We got so many options, with or without you
Either way, baby, I'm gone!
I had my shots, a piece of rock
Crown boy, you're black in patron!
So what you gonna do, what you gonna do?
Is it you, is it you, is it you?
If we're off in the club looking at each other
Somebody about to go home
We got so many options, with or without you
Either way, baby, I'm gone!
I had my shots, a piece of rock
Crown boy, you're black in patron!
So what you gonna do, what you gonna do?
Is it chu? Is it chu? Is it chu?

I was standing on the couches and I jumped on the table
Guess I'm feeling kinda cocky
Cause each move I make it's major
So I'm casing my surroundings and my goal with great time force
I'm the incredible, edible, aries spiece
The beauty ain't my flaw, nigga beast
The beauty of that, was it increased?
So I keep a hundred grands in my seat
Rubber bands in the backpack, yeah, we are asleep
Head to the back, in the bach
In the Caddy with a drop or the jeep
Yes, that's a fact ain't no better bitch than me
Not even possibly!
Apostrophe, doing my democracy
Enjoy shots rocking with me!
