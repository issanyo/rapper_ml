I drop bombs like Hiroshima
I know you hear me comin' (Da Bomb)
So you besta watch ya back
I know you hear me comin' (Da Bomb)
And I'm called the Miggida-Miggida-Mac

(Verse 1: Mac Daddy)
Can I drop the bomb? (Drop the bomb!)
Can I drop the bomb? (Drop the bomb!)
Can I drop the bomb? (Drop the bomb!)
Well, here it comes!
(Say what?)
Here it comes
It's the quicker gripper ripper
Known to flip a script like it ain't notin'
All ya MC's that dissed the M-A-Cs better duck an'
Run an' hide cause it's too late to try to make it (right!)
Ya just messed up and I ain't tryin' to let ya slide
Cause I ain't the one for that I ain't the one that slack
I'm the Miggida-Miggida-Mac pack and I ain't takin' jack
I don't care who you get or who ya wit'
Just you won't be equipped to what it takes to break this krossed
Out kid
I've got dessorked out clout 'cause I'm dessorked out
I'm bad type and if ya wanna know what I'm talkin about
So lay your cards on the table cause I'm able to rock
Whenever, where ever I still rocks the cradle
Cause I'm a nappy happy bad little son-of-a-gun
And in my eyes, you don't want none
Cause on the mic I get dum-diddy diddy-dum
So watcha back when I say here it comes

I know you hear me comin' (Da Bomb)
So you besta watch ya back
I know you hear me comin' (Da Bomb)
And I'm called the Miggida-Miggida-Mac

(Verse 2: Daddy Mac)
But, can I drop the bomb? (Drop the bomb!)
Can I drop the bomb? (Drop the bomb!)
Can I drop the bomb? (Drop the bomb!)
Well, here it comes
(Say what?)
Here it comes

(JD)
Understand that Kris to the Kross comes with nothing but flavor
We get our own on our own ain't askin for no favors
We're true to what we do that's how we be
So just rock with the D-A-double D-Y-M-A-C

(Daddy Mac)
I betcha never thought you would here it like this (Huh?)
Some funk for the trunk by this, named Kris (Word!)
See, I ain't into the game
I'm true to the gang
I'm poppin' your thang til the party people swang
Cause I'm a little rough neck
Tiffy-tiffy tough neck
Cause what gettin' 'nough respect
And all those little punks talkin' junk bring it on
Cause I just love takin' punks outta homes (Why?)
Cause I'm a nappy happy bad little sun-of-a-gun
And in my eyes, you don't want none
So watcha back or comments will starta runnin'
And do-do on yourself when you hear the daddy comin'

I know you hear me comin' (Da Bomb)
So you besta watch ya back
I know you hear me comin' (Da Bomb)
And I'm called the Daddy Mac

(Verse 3: Da Brat)
But, can I drop the bomb? (Drop the bomb!)
Can I drop the bomb? (Drop the bomb!)
Can I drop the bomb? (Drop the bomb!)
Well, here it...
(Say what?)
Comes
I'll be coming around the mountain' when I come droppin' a bomb
Creepin' up on those Romper Room suckas who wanna get some
So feel the wrath of a brat with the Mac pack
Walkin' away you're like the bottom of a door mat
I didn't gain props cause I was a suckas daughter
I had to earn them droppin' dynamite like Jimmy Walker
I can pay Donny Mars in a bird in a sticky cage
Give me 30-30 half-callibar half-gage
And if you don't know what I'm talkin' about
Test me out
We're in the big part of in The Last Boyscout
Scopin' them, like them niggas was in a haystack
Press the new rookie breakin' rims down like Shaq
You think you're dealin' with a weak boy step back
Cause I'm comin' up like a Veteran on a Mac track
I'm bein' all I wanna be so you tell Uncle Tom
Dat Da Brat done drop da bomb

I know you hear me comin' (Da Bomb)
So you besta watch ya back
I know you hear me comin' (Da Bomb)
And I am what they call Da Brat!
