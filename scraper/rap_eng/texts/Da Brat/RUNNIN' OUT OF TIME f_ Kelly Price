RUNNIN' OUT OF TIME f/ Kelly Price
KELLY
I'VE BEEN WONDERING WHERE YOU'VE BEEN SLEEPING
WE'VE BEEN RUNNIN' OUT OF TIME BECAUSE YOU WANT TO BE CREEPING, PIMPING
I'VE BEEN SITTING HOME ALONE AT NIGHT
I'VE BEEN CRYING
WE'VE BEEN RUNNING OUTTA TIME, TIRED OF YOUR LYING
BRAT
REALLY THOUGH
HOW MUCH TIME YOU THINK I'VE GOT
THE CLOCK IS TICKIN' AND TICKIN'
THE WAY YOU SLIPPIN'
AND THE WAY YOU FUCKING THE HONEYS ON THE BLOCK, STOP
CAUSE IF I GOTTA DROP KICK A HOE, I'LL KILL HER FOR SURE
THEY STICK AROUND UNTIL THE MURDER OCCURS
HOW YOU GONNA CREEP WITH ME AND SLEEP WITH HER
AT THE MOMENT OF TIME WHEN I HEARD THE NEWS
MY VISION MUST HAVE BEEN BLURRED
CAUSE I DIDN'T THINK THAT YOU DESERVED TO LOSE
THE NERVE OF FOOLS, SHIT
PEOPLE WERE SAYING WITH A CERTAINTY
BUT I CERTAINLY NEVER THOUGHT YOU'D TAKE IT
TO THE DEGREE OF HURTIN' ME, PURPOSELY
WE REHEARSED TO BE HUSBAND AND WIFE
SO I DEDICATED MY LIFE TO YOU
WHY
SO YOU COULD KEEP A CHICK ON THE SIDE
AND FLIP THE 5-SPEED, THE DICK ON THE SIDE
YOU LOOKIN' TO DIE FOR GIVING ME A TICKET TO SHINE
YOU CHOOSE TO LIE
I NEED A NIGGA WITH ATTITUDE
MIND
GIVE ME GRATITUDE WHEN I'M GIVING HIM SHINE
NO MATTER WHO THE BASTARD WAS
I WAS FAST TO SLUG
BUT HE NEVER RAN FAST ENOUGH
A MASTER AT THE CRAFTS CAUSE I ROLL WITH SOME MASS OF THUGS
LAUGHING AS I PASSED YOU UP
SHOULD HAVE TOLD ME YOU WANTED TO GET ASS AND FUCK
I WOULD HAVE SET IT UP SO WE ALL HAD SOME FUN
YOU INSIST TO GET AROUND
I'LL BE THE AID AND ASSIST YOU TO GET OUT
THANK THEM HOES CAUSE YOU SHIT OUT OF LUCK
AND I DON'T REGRET WHAT I SPIT OUT AND BUST
I'M SICK OF YOU AND TIRED OF US
I HAD ENOUGH OF THIS SITTING AT HOME CRYING STUFF AND BEING ALONE
NIGGA IS YOU WANT TO ROAM THE STREETS JUST LET ME BE
THERE'S A WHOLE GANG OF NIGGAS THAT WANT TO HIT MY SHEETS
CHORUS
I'VE BEEN WONDERING WHERE YOU'VE BEEN SLEEPING
WE'VE BEEN, RUNNIN' OUTTA TIME BECAUSE YOU WANT TO BE CREEPING, PIMPING
I'VE BEEN SITTING HOME ALONE AT NIGHT
I'VE BEEN CRYING
WE'VE BEEN RUNNIN' OUTA TIME, TIRED OF YOU LYING
SHIT
ALL I EVER DID WAS WAIT AND LOOK OUT THE WINDOW
SMOKE ME SOME ENDO
DROVE ME TO DRINKING AND GETTING BENT MORE
GAVE MYSELF 100% MORE TIME TO THINK
WAS LOVE DESIGNED TO STAY
REPEATEDLY YOU LIED TO ME
TOLD YOU TO CONFIDE IN ME
AIN'T NOTHING THEM OTHER HOES CAN DO
BECAUSE I MOLDED YOU TO FIT PROPERLY ONCE INSIDE ME
WHEN YOU STROKING THEM YOU THINKIN' OF RIDING ME
AND MOST OF THEM ARE HOPING TO SLIDE WITH ME
CAUSE I'M A FEROCIOUS HOSTESS WHEN IT COMES TO FREAKY SHIT
THE DOPEST
YOU HAD TO BLOW THIS ALL OUT OF PROPORTION
AND LOST YOU FOCUS WASTING MY TIME
CAUSE I'M GETTING OLDER
YOU THE REASON I KEEP THIS CHIP ON MY SHOULDER
44 IN A HOLSTER
BULLET PROOF VEST UNDER MY CLOTHES
HOW AM I SUPPOSED TO TRUST YOU
EVERY TIME I LEAVE TOWN I BUST YOU
FUCK YOU
THE MOANIN' AND GROANIN' LED ME TO THE PILLOW WHERE YOU LAID YOUR HEAD
LOOKED LIKE YOU'D RATHER BE DEAD INSTEAD
WENT AHEAD AND FOLLOWED THE SOUND THROUGH THE HALLWAY
SAID YOU'D ALWAYS BE TRUE
WHAT THE NEIGHBORS SAY THE BITCH WAS THERE ALL SAY WITH YOU
THAT'S WHY YOU AIN'T ANSWER WHEN I WAS PAGING YOU
I HIT THE DOOR, YOU DUCKED AND DOVE
SHE TRIED TO FIND HER CLOTHES
YA'LL WAS DODGING BULLET HOLES TOGETHER
YOU GO ON AND STAY WITH THAT BROKE HEFFER
YOU DON'T KNOW HOW SO SO DEF THIS IS
I AIN'T GOTTA SHOW A MOTHERFUCKER BREASTS TO KEEP HIM INTERESTED
YOU BETTER RECOGNIZE THE GOOD INVESTMENT
FROM THE WEST SIDE OF CHI NIGGA
CHORUS
TIRED OF YOUR LIES
TIRED OF YOUR SHIT
WHOA, RUNNIN OUT OF BREATH..
