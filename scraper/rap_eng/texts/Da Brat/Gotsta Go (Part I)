[Intro] [Da Brat]
Welcome to the wonderful world of Miss Kelly Rowland
And I am your host Da Brat tat-tat
SoSoDef is in the building
Yeah!

[Da Brat]
I got to shake you off
You like a bad habit that I got to break so I am taking off
Forsaking it all, all in your face
At point blank range do not play with my heart
I was loyal, I was kind
I was a fool because I was blind
Thought I was the one me the two
I was three times a lady for you
Creeping in and out, sleeping all around
Think you a ball now?
I got to trick for that booty
You a thing in the past
Where you *** calling now
You will never find another peach that's sweet as mine
Another river that is deep as mine
What you lose somebody else going to find

[Verse 1] [Kelly Rowland]
Late night I hear you creeping
4 A.M. footsteps laying there with the man I am sleeping
Laying there wondering (wondering)
Where you been
Wondering who she is
I wonder why you wake up, get dressed and step right out of here
This has got to end
A fight we will never win (win)
It is just too deep to miss (miss)
I guess I am too far in
If I continue to stay with you (you will do it again)
I know you will do it again
Yeah, you will do it again

[Hook] [ Kelly Rowland]
Never thought I could leave you
Had to take back the rest of me
To get back the best of me
And no longer make believe
I tried to stay with you
But you never worked it out
You gave me strength to leave (leave)

[Chorus] [Kelly Rowland]
Ladies, if you feel me say
Hey-yo, hey-yo
If you fed up say
I cannot do this no more
Ladies, if you feel me say
Hey-yo, hey-yo
Charge it to the game
Tell them you got to go
Whoa-o (whoa-o), whoa-o (whoa-o)
Whoa-o (whoa-o), whoa-ho (whoa-ho)
Whoa-o (whoa-o), whoa-o (whoa-o)
Whoa-o (whoa-o), whoa-ho (whoa-ho)

[Verse 2] [Kelly Rowland]
For a second you had me down
But now I am doing fine
(Boy, you thought I would take you back)
But it would not happen this time
Because all the times that I took you back
The times couldn't find your ass
(From calls from the chicks you had)
This part of the story is only half
(See me in the club) See me in the club
(I was looking fine) I was looking
(Seen you in the club)
(With a lot on your mind) Yeah
Now do not you get mad (no)
Why you look so sad
Still wish you was my man
Boy, do not you make me laugh

[Hook] [Kelly Rowland]
Never thought I could leave you
Had to take back the rest of me (rest of me)
To get back the best of me (best of me)
And no longer make believe
I tried to stay with you (I tried to stay with you)
But you never worked it out (uh)
You gave me strength to leave (leave)

[Chorus] [Kelly Rowland]
Ladies, if you feel me say (ladies if you feel me say)
Hey-yo, hey-yo
If you fed up say (if you cannot do this no more)
I cannot do this no more
Ladies, if you feel me say (if you feel me say)
Hey-yo, hey-yo
Charge it to the game (charge it to the -yo
Charge it to the game (charge it to the gaaaaame)
Tell them you got to go
Whoa-o (whoa-o), whoa-o (whoa-o)
Whoa-o (whoa-o), whoa-ho (whoa-ho)

[Rap Da Brat]
I used to bite my tounge
Because I am not want to say nuttin that will mess us up
I am not want to make you mad
And risk losing everything we had
But you got so out of control
And I hurt so bad that it felt like a hole in my soul
Had to let you go
Since you was tricking I let you know
I got to couple of homies that want to get at you
And pull the trigger so you do not hurt me no more
But see I got this I am not your average chicken
I drop, kick them and I pop this
Peaches roll and pour out a little liqour
Make a toast to my new n**** (yeah!)
Brag and boast because I am big, better
Do I want to get back together? Never!

[Bridge] [Kelly Rowland]
Neveeeeer!!!
You always messed around (you always messed around)
Constantly put me down
Convinced me to stick around (tried to put me down)
You always had me down
Thought you would break me down (thought you would break me down)
Come take a look around
Look who is alone now
I am gone!

[Chorus] [Kelly Rowland]
Whoa-o (whoa-o), whoa-o (whoa-o)
Whoa-o (whoa-o), whoa-ho (whoa-ho)
Whoa-o (whoa-o), whoa-o (whoa-o)
Whoa-o (whoa-o), whoa-ho (whoa-ho)

[Hook] [Kelly Rowland]
Never thought I could leave you
Had to take back the rest of me
To get back the best of me
And no longer make believe
I tried to stay with you
But you never worked it out
You gave me strength to leave
