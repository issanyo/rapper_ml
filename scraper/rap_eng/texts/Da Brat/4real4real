[Intro: Mariah Carey]
It's for real, for real, for real
For real, for real, for real (Turn me up)
It's for real, for real, for real, for real, for real
It's for real, for real (Oh)

[Post-Chorus: Mariah Carey]
Baby it's, baby it's, for real, for real, for real
Baby it's, baby it's, for real, for real, for real
Baby it's, baby it's, for real, for real, for real
Baby it's, baby it's, for real, for real, for real

[Verse 1: Mariah Carey]
Sometimes you be blowin' my mind
If you were mine, I'd take my time with you
But on the low, I'm shy
Though I front like I'm so next level fly
With them other guys
Really I wanna reach out and just touch you
If you could only realize how much I'd like to
Come knock-knockin' at your door
Give ol' girl the heave ho
And give a demonstration of what it's like

[Chorus: Mariah Carey]
When it's for real, for real
100 percent for real
Hotter than cable TV
Like something out of your dreams
It's for real, for real
Million percent the deal
So I'll just keep doing me
And eventually, you'll see
I'm for real, for real

[Post-Chorus: Mariah Carey]
Baby it's, baby it's, for real, for real, for real (Baby, I'm real)
Baby it's, baby it's, for real, for real, for real
(Baby, I'm for real, for real)
Baby it's, baby it's, for real, for real, for real
(Baby, it's for real, for real)
Baby it's, baby it's, for real, for real, for real

[Verse 2: Mariah Carey]
All my friends say I'm wasting my time on you
Trying to dissuade me with schemes
Wanna make it less than you seem
But I'm not that one, to listen to dumb
Chicks that wanna be, where I'm gonna be
Really I wanna reach out and just touch you
If you could only realize how much I'd like to
Lay myself down next to you fall asleep
Watching cartoons
And wake you up with something good
'Cause it's real

[Chorus: Mariah Carey]
When it's for real, for real
100 percent for real (100 percent)
Hotter than cable TV (Hotter than cable TV)
Like something out of your dreams (Dream)
It's for real, for real
Million percent the deal
So I'll just keep doing me (Me)
And eventually, you'll see
I'm for real, for real

[Post-Chorus: Mariah Carey]
Baby it's, baby it's, for real, for real, for real (Baby, I'm real)
Baby it's, baby it's, for real, for real, for real
(Baby, I'm for real, for real)
Baby it's, baby it's, for real, for real, for real
(Baby, it's for real, for real)
Baby it's, baby it's, for real, for real, for real

[Verse 3: Da Brat]
Check this out
For real, for real, yo
This ain't for play, ain't for play
I been tryna figure it out
How to come at you off tay day
It's morning and I wanna Shirley Murdock ya
Like as we lately
But on the low, I'm shy like MJ
I don't know what to say, say, say
But I know who I wanna do, do, do
I'm for real, for real, that's you, you, you
You ain't ever met nobody like me, me, me
Hotter than Comcast and satellite TV
Lemme demonstrate how it's supposed to be
'Cause it's something you can't imagine
Like outta ya dreams
Obviously, people gon' hate on me
They don't want me to date on ya
They don't want you with a paid woman
But they can't deny that I'm a rider since day one
It's for real, for real

[Chorus: Mariah Carey]
When it's for real, for real, for real
(When it's for real, for real, for real)
100 percent for real
Hotter than cable TV
Like something out of your dreams
(Like something out of your dreams)
It's for real, for real (More than a million)
Million percent the deal
So I'll just keep doing me (Keep doing me)
And eventually, you'll see
I'm for real, for real

[Post-Chorus: Mariah Carey]
(I'm for real, for real, for real, for real, for real, for real)
Baby, it's, baby, it's for real, for real, for real
Baby, it's, baby, it's for real, for real, for real
(Baby, I'm)
('Cause baby, I'm) Baby, it's, baby, it's for real, for real, for real
(Hey, for real, for real, for real, for real, for real)
Baby, it's, baby, it's for real, for real, for real
(Baby, when it's for real)

[Chorus: Mariah Carey]
When it's for real, for real
100 percent for real (I know)
Hotter than cable TV (I love it, I love it)
Like something out of your dreams (Oh, hur, hur best friend)
It's for real, for real
Million percent the deal
So I'll just keep doing me (So I will keep on being me)
And eventually, you'll see
I'm for real, for real (I'm for real, oh)

[Post-Chorus: Mariah Carey]
Baby it's, baby it's, for real, for real, for real (Baby, I'm real)
Baby it's, baby it's, for real, for real, for real
(Baby, I'm for real, for real)
Baby it's, baby it's, for real, for real, for real
(Baby, it's for real, for real)
Baby it's, baby it's, for real, for real, for real
