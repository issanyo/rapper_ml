[Intro]
To the tic toc you don't stop
To the beat beat and ya dont quit shit
(Repeat)

[Verse 1]
Before the sun shines the rain falls
Applause the encore
Haven't you heard of a bitch who can open like pores
Pop a nigga like a pimple keep it simple enough
Make 'em wonder what the fuck happened leavin em stuffed
Get that ass kicked fast quick in a hurry
You felt the fist of fury when you envisioned that i was comin'
Used to laugh when i had a demo
But since the big stretch lex limo
You ain't got no moe jokes
Ya wanna come on and go wit me
To my place hate to hurt ya feelings sexual healin ain't the case
Laced the tracks like angle dust
Thus fuckin wit us is deadly
Behead the whole crew of the last nigga who wasn't ready
Stay bregheted up, platinum plus
New BM Z3, four chrome's 18's three piece B B S treat seat's
And y'all shall find riches it's mad bitches gettin dough
I'll die for I go broke just a lil moe

[Chorus]
Just a lil bit more
Do me just a uhh
Just a lil bit more will ease my mind
Just a lil bit more
Do me just a uhh
Just a lil bit more will ease my mind

[Verse 2]
Now put one hand in the air if ya keep the chinky out effect
I live to party all night
And love to have sex
Got a main squeeze and a piece on the low
Make a good piece of cheese but could use some more
Who got a lighter bout to blaze up its tucked in tight
I let the ventilation slide sensation between the windpipe
Ignite it up try to bite my style too tought
Its too much , too lil, too late for you to come up
Be decieved of ya wanna be foolish this bad mannered bitch is
True to the shit, envoke the spirits like the craft's
Serve the niggas half the stash in case the cash get low
The bastard know
Fuck over the dough and die
Pick yo casket if you feel that you gone try some shit
No nigga ever lasted past the first attempt
I leave em baffled and gaffle em for all of they keys
Then dispence to my niggas like Sony distributing LP'S

[Chorus]
Just a lil bit more
Do me just a uhh
Just a lil bit more will ease my mind

[Bridge]
To the tic toc and ya dont stop
To the beat beat and ya dont quit
To the tic toc and ya dont stop
To the beat beat and ya dont quit
To the tic toc and ya dont stop
To the beat beat and ya dont quit
A lil moe bitch
A lil moe nigga
A lil moe baby

[Outro]
That'll ease your mutha-phuckin' mind...
So so def wit that mind blowin shit
