[Chorus: Lil Bow Wow]
(You know me)
Yo this is Bow Wow, uh-huh
(You know me)
What can y'all do to me
Nothing
Shut it all the way down
(You know me)
Ain't no question I'mm do what I do every trip mama
A little pimp
(You know me)
All I do is find 'em
Love 'em and flee
It's like that
Little cat but I'm nice
(You know me)
Don't believe please
Step, step, step up
'Cause I'm bad like Mike
(You know me)
'Bout to watch small change, all change
Into big bucks

[Verse 1: Lil Bow Wow]
My niggas all we do is put down the smash
While y'all playa hataz keep coming with trash
I'm everything y'all been looking for
Everything that keep y'all straight hitting the floor
Little girls in the hood I got 'em all shook up
Tryna find this nigga so we can hook up
Even girls 18 they be tryna sneak
They find all kinds of ways to get next to me
I'm the don in this new millennium
O-H-I-O is where I'm from
I might of said it before but I'mma say it again
Since I stepped y'all niggas can't win
It's the B-O dub all in the club
The reason that girl keep shaking her butt
(You know me)
Gots to keep it going on
With JD on the track how can I go wrong?

[Chorus: Jermaine Dupri ]
Shut it all the way down
(You know me)
Ain't no question
I'ma do what I do what I does every trip mama
Big pimp
(You know me)
All I do is find 'em, love 'em and flee
It's like that
Big cat and I'm nice
(You know me)
Don't believe, please
Step, step, step up
And I'm bad like Mike
(You know me)
'Bout to watch small change, all change
Into big bucks, uh

[Verse 2: Jermaine Dupri]
Girls that talk slick
I don't want that
I want me a nice girl type
That ain't really been touched
If she all in the mix
I don't want that
Cause those be the hoes that talk to much
That five double oh
I don't want that
I want me a six with the tricks and the tv in the roof
That bottle of Mo'
I don't want that
Bring me the pineapple, cranberry
And the grapefruit sour
Do it, five flavor flow like fluid
Swallow I'm tryna keep y'all dancing like never before
Screaming at the DJ gimme some more
It's So So Def and we don't play
Put it down like this every day
And in the A-T-L-A-N-T-A, G-A that's where I stay
Now march

[Chorus: Da Brat]
You gotta find a way to turn it up man
Uh, uh, shut it all the way down
(You know me)
Ain't no question I do what I do every trip papa
A big pimp
(You know me)
And all is find 'em
Love 'em and flee, it's like that
It's Da Brat and I'm nice
(You know me)
And if you don't believe, please
Step, step, step up
I'm bad like Mike
(You know me)
And all I do is keep on making the big, big bucks

[Verse 3: Da Brat]
Niggas with no dough I don't want those
Broke in the club all night holler at any ho
Pretty boys who feminine I don't want that
I need a thug to keep my adrenaline pumpin' fast
Hook up my grandma with a fresh new V with a note attached
Telling her you love me
The six-o-six-four-four and I'm too nice to stop the flow
Rock some more
So So Def is a family
We on top and that's how it has to be
From JD to Bow Wow, to JE and me
Everything we drop so hot continuously
If the sex ain't freaky that ain't me
And if the check ain't weekly, we can't be
I'm still a big thang getter
Big Momma the Brat from C-H-I-C-A-G-O
