[Intro]
Uh oh o, uh uh o, ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
Uh oh o, uh uh o, ah-ah-ah-ah-ah

[Verse 1]
Bringing more noise than pg-we true and flew in life
Leave us-JD and rock a party all night tight nigga
One,two,three,four,five,six,seven
I can rap like hell but make it sound like heaven well
Seven,six,five,four,three,two,one
JD-what the deal is? Lemme get some
How many occasions,you and your liasons
Can't fuck with this phenomenon,division,separated from the norm
Pop a lot of Shawn Don and celebrate the good times
So get your groove on, pulling on the in-and let's all get high
In the back of my-Black on Black,you come through in ninety
Bumpin' you remind me with the cops right behind me
I got head rest, Genesis played by the Brat-Hey
Bulletproof windows, for negroes, that wanna act
Don't wanna face the fact, That that's the way we live
Lookin' everyday Jig, Buyin' everything big-You dig? Nigga
You don't wanna' go the distance-Surrender-Consistence
Allows me the key clock contender
And enter a new millenium,Cracking mutherfuckers craniums
Droppin Bombs-Saddam Hussein and nigga's straining
Hit a little,I'm feeling tickles from the nickels I smoked
The sweat trickle,as I slid a little liquor down my throat
It ain't no hope for these nigga's who broke and acting big willy
They dream to see a milly and talk shit before it happen really
Spark up another philly and eyewitness
The Brat fulfilling champagne and caviar wishes
The lifestyle of the bitch is famous,Make the payment to chante
Embarass nigga's live a hobby-All day harris
Fly me to the moon,soon and very soon stay tuned
Prepare to meet you doom 'cause it ain't no room for you

[Chorus]
No matter what they keep on saying and what they thinking
We be keepin' in live,Keepin' it live-Its' like straight to the scene
It's like that it's Da Brat just
Keepin' it live,Keepin' it we make you say
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah,ah-ahh,ah-ah-ahh
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah,ah-ahh,ah-ah-ahh

[Verse 2]
And if you're feeling for masquerade,I can rock a party today
Breaking parlay as we stack cakes of cheddar
Butter like parkay,wanted in four plates-sex
So-so definitely the best,Better watch your step
It's pooky,Trap with hits I make 'em clap to this
You knew we was coming back to kick some asses kid
It's nigga's like me that have more fun
Pop mo' bottles than the next one
Supermodel sex and make a portion
Now catch me if you can like the gingerbread man
Fifty grand in my hand sit-tin' on top of the world
Half drunk,high as fuck,shitting hard,legs swinging
Bringing the ruckus to all motherfuckers-woooo
Hey yo,Brat you Da funk bandit
Act like you know,the baddest sweet habit having mommy to hit the door
Flash it a little,living riddles can't buy the vittles
Get cash,Life don't only come once-to let it pass
To all my nigga's rockin' big jewels,brand new shoes and new kicks
Nigga's from the old school that started all this shit
Big time weightholders,Dope clocking for years
Nigga's you watched as a shorty thinking that's the way to live
Giving all I got to give,us bitches is pushing sixes
With ten thousand dollar bracelets around they wrist
Legistics,is strictly riches,the other fishes in the sea
Can't be malicious as me,fucking with G's

[Chorus]
No matter what they keep on saying and what they thinking
We be keepin' in live,Keepin' it live-Its' like straight to the scene
It's like that it's Da Brat just
Keepin' it live,Keepin' it we make you say
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah,ah-ahh,ah-ah-ahh
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah,ah-ahh,ah-ah-ahh
