[Chorus]
I know you think I'm young and naive
But you gotta trust in me
To be strong and responsible
'Cause I think I'm in love
I know you think I'm young and naive
But you gotta trust in me
To be strong and responsible
'Cause I think I'm in love

[Verse 1: Solange (Beyonce)]
Don't try to tell me this ain't real
(I know I'm young)
It's in the way he makes me feel
(I know I'm young)
I think my baby is the one
(I know I'm young)
It's in the way he holds it down
(I know I'm young)
I know you think that this is real
(And you're too young)
I know exactly how you feel
(And you're too young)
Too young to know if he's the one
(And you're too young)
Girl you got time so slow it down

[Chorus]
I know you think I'm young and naive
But you gotta trust in me
To be strong and responsible
'Cause I think I'm in love
I know you think I'm young and naive
But you gotta trust in me
To be strong and responsible
'Cause I think I'm in love

[Bridge:  Solange Beyonce]
It's too complicated
To explain my relationship
My friends are hating
Cause they ain't feelin' what I'm feelin'
Leave me alone and just let me be
Find your own thing and get off of me
It's not complicated girl
I've been where you are before
I'm not underratin'
I'm just tryin' to protect your feelings
Solange, listen to me
Understand what I'm sayin'
You'll realize one day how much I care

[Chorus]
I know you think I'm young and naive
But you gotta trust in me
To be strong and responsible
'Cause I think I'm in love
I know you think I'm young and naive
But you gotta trust in me
To be strong and responsible
'Cause I think I'm in love

[Verse 2 Rap: Da Brat]
Solange, you might love the boy
Even sneak around the corner, kiss and hug the boy
But Beyonce been there before
And she wouldn't want anybody to hurt you
Cause Matthew would drill the boy
And I can't ignore that you young
We just don't want you to get sprung
On some young dumb-dumb with no crumbs
Get all up in your heart and then run
Gettin' your heart broke is no fun
Neither is somebody tellin' you he not the one
You gotta learn for yourself though
And if you don't experience things
Then you'll never know
I don't want you wishin'
You coulda, shoulda, woulda did it, but you didn't
Listenin to other people's advice
It's your life
Make your own decisions really

[Bridge:  Solange Beyonce]
It's too complicated
To explain my relationship
My friends are hating
Cause they ain't feelin' what I'm feelin'
Leave me alone and just let me be
Find your own thing and get off of me
It's not complicated girl
I've been where you are before
I'm not underratin'
I'm just tryin' to protect your feelings
Solange, listen to me
Understand what I'm sayin'
You'll realize one day how much I care

[Chorus]
I know you think I'm young and naive
But you gotta trust in me
To be strong and responsible
'Cause I think I'm in love
I know you think I'm young and naive
But you gotta trust in me
To be strong and responsible
'Cause I think I'm in love

[Outro]
I know you think I'm young and naive
But you gotta trust in me
To be strong and responsible
'Cause I think I'm in love
I know you think I'm young and naive
But you gotta trust in me
To be strong and responsible
'Cause I think I'm in love
