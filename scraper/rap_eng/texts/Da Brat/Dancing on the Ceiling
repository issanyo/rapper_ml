Something has come over me
Got all the feels
Running circles around me
Head over heels

We'll stop at nothing, to get what we want
Can't fight the feeling, there's no moving on

Knocking on you front door
Stepping in the DMs
Dreaming of my first kiss
Thinking this could be it
It all feels the same
Hanging on your last snap, watching it on replay
Bring it to real life making it the best day

I'm gonna go up down, moving all around
Like I'm upside down, Dancing on the Ceiling
I'm gonna go up down, moving all around
Like I'm upside down, Dancing on the Ceiling
Yeah Yeah, Dancing on the Ceiling Yeah Yeah
Yeah Yeah, Dancing on the Ceiling Yeah Yeah


The light are gonna be on me
That's how I like it
Played you like an ugly game
But you don't mind it

We'll stop at nothing
To get what we want
Can't fight the feeling
There's no moving on

Running through the hallway
Flipping through the textbook
Waiting on your FaceTime
Overthink each look
Hanging on your last wish
Now I'm going crazy
Looking for a lady that can call me baby
Yeah, I'm at the top of my class I bring the party and I never be last
Never see me coming while I'm running these laps
The flyest guy in school, always get the last laugh

I'm gonna go up down, moving all around
Like I'm upside down, Dancing on the Ceiling
I'm gonna go up down, moving all around
Like I'm upside down, Dancing on the Ceiling
Yeah Yeah, Dancing on the Ceiling Yeah Yeah
Yeah Yeah, Dancing on the Ceiling Yeah Yeah
