[Jermaine Dupri]
You know all we know how to do is keep it hot
This is So So
See I'm bout it, bout it
Now is you with it, with it
I don't care how you get your dough
Just get it, get it
See I'm bout it, bout it
Now is you with it, with it
I don't care how you get your dough
Just get it, get it, get it

[Jesse]
Girl I've been longing to make love to you
Now we're alone so if you're in the mood
I will hold you, caress you
And slowly undress you
Girl that's what I wanna do
Well that's what I'm gonna do

1 - Don't you, don't you know
I'm bout it
If you ain't heard about me
Just remove that coat
I'mma break you off
No doubt girl is you ready
Girl is you ready

I can take places you've never known before
I know you think you know it baby
But let me show you more
I mean girl I'm gonna satisfy the woman inside of you
That's what I wanna do
And that's what I'm gonna do

Repeat 1 (2x)

Coming from 60-644
Keep me, B-R-A-T
You ain't heard about me
I'm the most shit poppin' dis
Ain't no stoppin' it's
Dolla, after dolla
It's holla when you need a hit
So So Def is the clique I claim
Westside when I ride, come equipped with game
In it quick, 2000 bounce with no range
You hate cause y'all wish y'all was doing the same
Without the 20 twin-twin's I don't operate right
So somebody, anybody pass me a mic
I rock for the thug, niggas that sell drugs
Ladies in the club that shake it for the paper
Those who take new whips and fill them up with speakers
I hate the word cheaper
I love new sneakers
I'm bout it
You wanna test me? Undress me
The remix with Brat, JD, and Jesse

Repeat 1 till end
