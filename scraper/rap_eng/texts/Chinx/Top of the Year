[Verse 1: Chinx]
Quit cryin over shit, shoulda been did it
Whens is you gon' boss?
Can't turn you back on your homies, they depend on ya
Whens is you gon' boss?
Back against the wall, nigga gotta hold the fort down
Whens is you gon' boss?
Fuck nigga talkin about cryin like he ain't eatin (fuck 'em)
Nigga you won't boss
Tear, sweat and blood like a new Piru
Plushed out suite with a poolside view
Double cup on me - two times two
Sunset Boule about to loose my roof
Got a couple freaks down to moulin rouge
Fuck nigga ain't tryin' to do what I do
Wasn't all that, only hit it once
Told her I ain't down with the déjà vu
You gon' boss when you just came home
And your ex got a baby with your homie (damn)
You gon' boss when your pockets on E
And all you got is a fresh Glock 40
You gon' boss when you pull up to the club
Jewels on lookin' like Drop Top Shorty
You gon' boss when you got no choice
But do it like a young nigga hit the court and drop 40

Fuck nigga cryin' over shit he shoulda been did
Whens is you gon' boss?

Whens is you gon' boss?
Arkansas native gotta hold the fort down
Whens is you gon' boss?
Stupid ass bitch talkin' about how she ain't freaky (what?)
Bitch, you won't boss
Coming from the backwoods, smokin' backwoods
Country nigga, flip a quarter sack, anotha make 100
Made it to the top floor from the dirt floor (?)
Following the paper trail, I was headed to the money
Told you niggas way back in the day that
When I finally make it on my own all my niggas gonna shine
Now you on the backroad by the front door 'bout wishin you was down with the shit the whole time
You gon' boss when your money stacked high
Finna mess with more pies (?) and ya niggas all eatin'
You gon' boss when you pull up in the brand new foreign
Park it right in front, makin' sure they all see ya
You gon' boss when you realize these hatin' ass niggas only hatin' cause they really wanna be ya
You gon' boss when you start to take notice your the realest nigga left and the game really need ya
