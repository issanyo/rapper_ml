[Hook x2: O.T. Genasis]
I'm in love with the coco
I'm in love with the coco
I got it for the low, low
I'm in love with the coco

[Verse 1: Chinx Drugz]
Found the paper, then I dove in it
Aston Martin, nigga, drove in it
Copped the whip and throw the stove in it
Whip that shit in less than four minutes
Flocka ring the chickens just the way I like
Talkin' nine piece biscuit just the way I like
Talk about the money, often show with it
Ain't about yo biscuit, have my young'n knock a hole in 'I'm

[Refrain 1: Chinx Drugz]
Takin' orders, I been takin' orders
Takin' orders, I been takin' orders
Bust up nigga, I don't take no orders
They should throw my face on the box of the bakin' soda

[Hook x2]

[Verse 2: O.T. Genasis]
Thirty six, that's a kilo (aqui)
Need a brick, miss my free throw
I'm in love, just like Ne-Yo
Bustin' shots, now he Neo
Free my homies, fuck the C.O
Fuck the judge, fuck my P.O
All this coke, like I'm Nino
Water whip, like I'm Nemo

[Refrain 2: O.T. Genasis]
Bakin' soda, I got bakin' soda
Bakin' soda, I got bakin' soda
Whip it through the glass, nigga
I'm blowin' money fast, nigga

[Hook x2]
