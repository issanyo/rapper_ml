[Intro - Lil Durk (Chinx Drugs)]
I ain't gone lie, (I ain't gone lie)
I ain't gone lie, (I ain't gone lie)
I ain't gone lie, (I ain't gone lie)
I ain't gone lie

[Verse 1 - Lil Durk]
I ain't gone lie, Got K's in the crib that'll shoot
40 cal, 50 cal, one call my niggas gone hit you up
I ain't gone lie, got bricks in the crib for the low
One call my niggas gotta get that move
I ain't gone lie

[Hook - Chinx Drugs]
(I ain't gone lie)
We move that work right from off of the playground
(I ain't gone lie)
These niggas quiet, the shit I be smoking it stay loud
(I ain't gone lie)
Them youngins I came with don't play around
(I ain't gone lie)
They hit your chest and yo head with that K round
(I ain't gone lie)

[Verse 2 - Chinx Drugs]
Letting off a hundred round drum, cook a pussy nigga well done
Stick the fork in em, my young niggas hit em for the low
Real niggas sitting in the feds
Down to go to war for the spread
Hope you got a helmet, hit a fuck nigga in the head
Extended clip, hey
Need an extra liver cause I'm 'bout mine
Nigga you food, and every nigga with me know it's chow time
Hold it steady ay, niggas keep your eyes on the target
Ain't nobody gonna miss â€˜em, just one less pussy nigga on the market

[Hook]

[Verse 3 - Lil Durk]
I ain't gone lie to a nigga
Talkin all this roof, Imma ladder me a nigga
Tell em climb up, Rolex on me say time's up
50 seconds from the west niggas get ground up
Ain't gone lie to a nigga dad
Or another nigga he don't give a damn of
I keep the nine tucked, if you come around wrinkle my shit
You gon have some, then we been work
Stay on the porch and finish school first
Proof in the line to me, nigga you gone need a hearse
OTF, 300, CokeBoy I know you niggas heard of Lil Durk
No CNN or TMZ, Chiraq where you heard it first

[Hook]
