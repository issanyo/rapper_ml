[Hook]
In that red flame, clogging up the lane
Gripping more grain, bitch, I'm in the game
(Nigga talk about it)
Fuck 'em all, I ain't jacking what they saying
Looking both ways, watching for them lames
(Nigga talk about it)
Feeling good, money straight, purp on deck
Nigga talk about it (nigga talk about it)
Nigga talk about it (nigga talk about it)
Nigga talk about it (nigga talk about it)
Nigga talk about it (nigga talk about it)

[Verse 1]
Eight racks, throw it up, more drink, pour me up
Rolls Royce, roll it up, Coke Boys, you know what's up
Nigga flyer than a bald eagle
Hands stay filthy, but I tell the white people that it's all equal
Picture we game, cause you all sequels
All that fuck shit is only gone lead you
To a pine box, Curtis took nine shots
And lived out, you do the same
And watch how I do it again
All green dot, watch how I do the chain
Youâ€™re wearing suede in the rain, nigga you Jermaine
Tryna get the whole thing, nigga use your brain
Peep how I cut these niggas off, I done took the lane
Maserati, Kawasaki, rolling on em
Coke Boys got the city in the smash, 750, all cash
If they ain't talking math those the ones I blow past

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Talking bout that glass house, talking bout that Ghost
Talking about success, got these niggas by the throat
You ain't talking about a thing, yeah, I pull the strings
Like a violin, sliding in all the little flavors
Had a 50K lit, couple inches on his lip
And his tie super skinny, slide with your bitty
Niggas outdated get their clock fixed
Swagger jacking ass, all these niggas do is shoplift
Talking about the city on my back, nigga, that's a fact
Had they little run now they wheezing in the back
Different colored gems got me looking like those Ms
Weight all away up like I'm lifting up the gym
Niggas do the same shit these hoes do
Hurry up and die, fuck, nigga, I done told you
Few years I've been shaking in the game
Fuck what you're talking, cause our conversation ain't the same

[Hook]
