[Verse 1: Trouble]
Ak 47's, Mac 11's, to Glock's and 40's
Turn your motherfucking block into a grove street party
Now Waka Flocka popping, [?]
Turn your shit upside down when I come through with French Montana
Niggas don't want no ana, [?] on my ana
Evidence lookin' like you've been spillin' strawberry fanta
Blood all over the scene, it's for that [?]
I got a ghetto dream, a few licks, a few rings

[Hook: French Montana]
I made a few flips, the money grew wingz
Squad took the chips I talk a few rings
Talk about few bottles, talk about few chains
Talk about few cars, I need a few things
And hell yeah I'm getting high, it's the high way
I bought a half a mil car in the drive way
Money machine is my favorie anthem, (Money Clearrr)
That's my favorite answer

[Verse 2: French Montana]
Five stacks to my favorite dancer
Stumber ass up shawty like lift yo pants up
Money longer than the flight to Taiwain
Got your bitch going down like my time line
Panamoney..
50 thou' Rolly, 50 cal for your head
[?], be clear
We the mob, flip the chips need a few rings
Call 500 horses crow wings
Bitch I be ballin' like a metalhead
100 round drum sound like the metal band
Coldplay, U2 fucking with the leaders in the new school

[Hook: French Montana]
I made a few flips, the money grew wingz
Squad took the chips I talk a few rings
Talk about few bottles, talk about few chains
Talk about few cars, I need a few things
And hell yeah I'm getting high, it's the high way
I bought a half a mil car in the drive way
Money machine is my favorie anthem, (Money Clearrr)
That's my favorite answer

[Verse 3: Waka Flocka]
Aye, aye
Homie this the life, half a million dollar car at the red light (FLEX)
She say she like the way the shit feel
When I talk man she say she get a cold chill
Told her blame it on my grill. Baby I'm addicted
Married to Bricksquad, that's how I'm livin'
Wake up in the morning two bitches
Two swishes, wish I had two dicks, ugh
Bring more more more more liquor, tonight's a movie motion picture
If I throw these bands would you lick her
Everything on me baby pick a liquor

[Hook: French Montana]
I made a few flips, the money grew wingz
Squad took the chips I talk a few rings
Talk about few bottles, talk about few chains
Talk about few cars, I need a few things

[Verse 4: Chinx Drugz]
Train daily man on the roof I got to wait with birds
And you can keep that bitch she's an angry bird
Hundred carats on my arms
[?] for that body with that bomb
Whip game big chain, super charge
You know them coke boys goes stupid hard
I'm super stupid [?] I fuck with stupid groupie
Big money on his hand baby lose his [?]
Nigga swerving in that ride watch your step nigga get you murder on that side
Them Mac baller wingz with me French with me ride with me Slim with me
And rap slow I'm gon' show em how to move that whitney

[Hook: French Montana]
