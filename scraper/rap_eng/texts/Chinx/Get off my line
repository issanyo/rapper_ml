Thats right....

Bitch get off my line, bitch get off my line
Bitch get off my line, bitch get off my line
Snatch the weave off that ho, make her walk it out
Snatch the weave off that ho, make her walk it out
Pour that drink up, put that kush up in the air
Pour that drink up, put that kush up in the air
Bitch get off my line, bitch get off my line
Bitch get off my line, bitch get off my line

I put that ho on the track and then she walked in
I put my money on the lease then I walk in
I see some hoes in this thang they finna jump
I see some hoes in this thang they finna jump
I done blew damn near bout 50 this month
Backseat, ass up, stuck her head up in the trunk, dont lose me now
Let some 30 for that birdie then you caught a lick
He was straight up in the ho and then he laid a brick
Knock the bottom out your bitch and make her burn it up
Coke boys in this thang bout to turn it up
Told her buss open that peach, G.A
Shawty call her friend and now them hoes is on the freeway

Bitch get off my line, bitch get off my line
Bitch get off my line, bitch get off my line
Snatch the weave off that ho, make her walk it out
Snatch the weave off that ho, make her walk it out
Pour that drink up, put that kush up in the air
Pour that drink up, put that kush up in the air
Bitch get off my line, bitch get off my line
Bitch get off my line, bitch get off my line

Stop fuckin with a nigga, leave me 'lone
Only reason they be flockin, cause them bitches know we on
Medicine up in the air, hella smoke you know we strong
Going deep for them bands, hail mary going long
Shawty open wide, mobile home up on her back
That's a double Y, I go doggy from the back
Put in overtime
Took it down, now she blowing out my ninex
And you know I whip the thang like a pyrex, I whip it
There's only one crime we can co-exist, nah
Before this rap shit, I was throwing bricks
They know I keep a choppa for the made man
Laughing to the bank, all them mary days payday
Out in houston flash out my nigga baby, wassup
These niggas look like they'll tell, Dae Dae
If you hear dem niggas rappin' like this
Just remember who done started that shit
Trick get off my fuckin-

Bitch get off my line, bitch get off my line
Bitch get off my line, bitch get off my line
Snatch the weave off that ho, make her walk it out
Snatch the weave off that ho, make her walk it out
Pour that drink up, put that kush up in the air
Pour that drink up, put that kush up in the air
Bitch get off my line, bitch get off my line
Bitch get off my line, bitch get off my line
