[Verse 1: Chinx Drugz]
Came up and they know it
Drinks up and they pour it
I be hoppin on that money like a fool
I be fightin off that itch
I get that scratch off them corners
With them rollers keep them chickens on a hatch
Shawty do it like a pro
Bust it open with no hands
Make her way up on the pole
Then she droppin scoop them bands
She a wild one, they don't does it how I do
In my car in hot pursuit
I get silly for that loot
Nigga listen here
I be on it, keep the preziez on my mop
Play my game back in rewind
Shawty watch me do it
I be on it, get that money all the time
Got your main bitch on my line

[Hook]
Hey I heard you were a wild one Oooh
If I took you home it'd be a home run. Show me how..

Show me how you do that
Got the drink on
Got the pills rollin
Finna get in mountain zone
Said she's sick of him, so she can get with me
She won't leave a nigga alone

[Verse 2: Chinx Drugz]
Shawty know I'm that one
Hit the chuck of that deuce
Smoke clogging my lungs
Fresh off of that loot
Know them coke boys gon ball
10 bags of my small pocket
Shawty jump when I call
She bring it to me that's all profit
Hackin off of that jack
Hoppin in in your bitch
VS1 my name
Shawty catch when I pinch
She be scoopin' them bills
Niggas tossin' them banks
Probably off in that drank
Probably off in them zens
I be on it, get that money all the time
Niggas see me post it up like a ball player
I be on it 24 I'm on my grind
Stack that cake like dunk and high
I need more legs

[Hook]
