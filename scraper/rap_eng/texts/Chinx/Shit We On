That Purp I'm on, lean I'm on, hen I'm on
Type of shit we on,your bitch gone and my brain gone
Cause i know she looking for someone to show her the whole world baby!!

[Verse 1: Chinx Drugz]
Eyy yo you know i figured out
Its two type of niggas in this world
You got the niggas that get it
And the niggas that watch it go down
I give your bitch back first we need a moment
187 on that pussy yeah i Peter roll it
You only get one shot shorty seize the moment
In that Bentley hard top know you see me rolling
Coke boys driving round the globe
Fresh home, 3 tours hit the pot of gold
Don't be stingy with that cookie shorty bring it here
You got some issues with ya nigga hold on bring him here

[Hook]
That Purp I'm on, lean I'm on, hen I'm on

[Verse 2: French Montana]
Affilated don't get yourself humiliated
Getting to the money homie save that bitch for later
Bitch a dime me and the chrome nickel plated
M.J. jump shot get em faded
Smoking on that granddaddy drinking dark
Chopper hit you take off a body part
Elephant balls with a lion heart
Came up out the corner now he on the charts

[Hook]
That Purp I'm on, lean I'm on, hen I'm on
Type of shit we on,your bitch gone and my brain gone
Cause i know she looking for someone to show her the whole world baby!!

Blue dot and green lean is what im soaking on
Falling off and downfalls is what they hoping on
White gold but look better with the golden on
All my niggas strapped up no trojans on
At the top its just us my foot they try holding on
Pull them pants down from the back get my poking on
Bitch rip your shirt off get your hulk hogan on

[Hook]
That Purp I'm on, lean I'm on, hen I'm on
Type of shit we on,your bitch gone and my brain gone
Cause i know she looking for someone to show her the whole world baby!!
