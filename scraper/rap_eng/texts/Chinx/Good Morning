[Introduction:]
Good morning! That’s right. . . it’s a new day in the game . . . Coke Boys, Riot Music Group . . . without further interruption let’s get into it

[Hook:]
It’s a slow road to the fame when the windows is closed
When it’s clo-o-o-o-sed
My ten toes in the game on my way through the cold
Through the co-o-o-o-ld
I’m bout to bring this through the game like the wind when it blows
When it blo-o-o-ws
These niggas insects on my windshield I wipe ‘em
Twin vets and double piping
And nigga you ain’t none like him

[Verse:]
Niggas want to kill me, bitches want to date me
Some niggas will feel me, other niggas hate me
Death or jail is the ultimatum
You supposed to hate him
Jewelry bright, stones clear
Flying in my own Lear
Fuck niggas I don’t hear ‘em
My definition of a million is relief
We hold court up in the streets, no police
Knots busting out my pockets all profit
Lord help me get my daily bread
These niggas famished, see they barley fed
Jewelry red Panamera black Herrera shades
Jewelry lemonade I’m killing the game
Watch me demonstrate
Bad bitches on me, no deuces just tens like Timberlake
Crack the window let the breeze ventilate
Nothing but a thousand make you monkey niggas disappear
Life is cheap bitches acting up
So I wifed the streets
Live in the fire because I like the heat
Feeling on my suede said she like my seats
Everything I own nigga got receipts
Close range with the chopper split his wig open
No insurance for the doctor wounds still smoking
Coke Boys put the city back up on the mizzap
Rapper looking sleepy I can help them with a nizzap
Blowing 30,000 on my wrist is not a mishap
Shooters bang the pains on you so to change just sit back
My melody’s addictive so they call me Drugz
Niggas hate the air I breathe bitches show me love

[Hook:]
