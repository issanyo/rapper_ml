[Hook – Manolo Rose]
Pull up in some shit that made his stomach hurt
Fuck with me baby, you’ll get your money’s worth
You want to get like me, you got to whip it up and put it in the streets
If you want to get like me, you got to whip it up and put it in the streets
Lil nigga get your shit together
Lil homie get your shit together
If you want to get like me
Lil homie, you got to get your shit together
If you want to get like me
Lil homie, you got to get your shit together
If you want to get like me
Lil homie, you got to get your shit together

[Verse 1 – Manolo Rose]
Lil homie get your shit straight
Gym star razor blade scratching up my dinner plate
I had to do the damn thing
To put some food on my dinner plate
Tell papi need it now, not a minute late
I need a Spanish bitch to bring it in a [?]
Hop up on a plane and bring it cross the water
And one sniff’ll have a nigga walking on water

[Hook]

[Verse 2 – Chinx]
Border working, whipping, throw it on the scale
Told my ho don’t get to crying, just go get the bale
Pot scraping, I be baking like a top chef
Flee the kitchen when they kick in, be a hot mess
Hit the yolo with the ice, nigga cold with it
Nigga watch the water bubble when the stove hit it
Kill em with it, whip that bitch till it’s [?] four minutes
40 on a nigga’s wrist, cold as four winters
Pull up on it and hop out and leave the Ghost white
Creep up on your bitch in a white Martin
Told that ho to take a nose dive
Trap house, they gone roll a white carpet

[Hook]
