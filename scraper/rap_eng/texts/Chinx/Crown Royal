[Intro]
We don't count the money on this side, we just weight it

[Hook]
Probably walkin' with a hundred thou on (Yay!)
With a funny nose, couldn't clown on me
Niggas at the top lookin' down on ya
Down to chop the door, with the crown on
Light the pot, drop the pollo in
Light the pot, drop the pollo in
Niggas on the top lookin' down on ya
Down to chop the door, with the crown on

[Verse 1]
Inside Italian, outside microfiber
Doors go up Daniel-son, probably that Crouching Tiger
Sip Crown in dat Royce
Never solid, you moist
Ball like I play for Kansas
Top dog on the (?)
I don't want no excuses, told (?) to get my retainer
Chop a body to pieces, stuffed in different containers
Just to get to that crown, ran (?) that crown
(?) Caprices on that Regal
Cleanse your body from evil
I just popped me two Zans, finna fuck me a waitress
Drumma, he from Sudan
Surgical with two lasers
Lift the ground up from under you
Choppa turn you to dust
Hope fuck niggas perish
For the In Gods We Trust

[Hook]
Probably walkin' with a hundred thou on (Yay!)
With a funny nose, couldn't clown on me
Niggas at the top lookin' down on ya
Down to chop the door, with the crown on
Light the pot, drop the pollo in
Light the pot, drop the pollo in
Niggas on the top lookin' down on ya
Down to chop the door, with the crown on

[Verse 2]
Only youngin still playing by the old rules
Can't learn a new dance wearing old shoes
No dance instruction, bust ya own move
Eenie, miney, moe, bitches gon' choose
Rainin' doing about a buck nigga hydroplanin'
Get cha crown snatched, kufi confiscated
Got the accolades on the corner
Dope from Peru, sniff from Tijuana
Turn nanos (?) to the bando
Feed a dog, can you trust 'em in a jam tho?
Steph Curry with the handle
Pussy nigga kick rocks - Jesus sandal

[Hook]
Probably walkin' with a hundred thou on (Yay!)
With a funny nose, couldn't clown on me
Niggas at the top lookin' down on ya
Down to chop the door, with the crown on
Light the pot, drop the pollo in
Light the pot, drop the pollo in
Niggas on the top lookin' down on ya
Down to chop the door, with the crown on

[Outro]
Haha, you still worried about that shit on the ground level?
Niggas up at the top laughing down at ya
Better figure out how to get up there
Dufflel bag shit
Brown bag, plastic bag
However you bring the money, it all count the same
Coke Boy shit
