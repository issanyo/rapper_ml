[Intro]
Ohh, way
Woah
(La Musica de Harry Fraud)

[Hook: Mavado]
I'm legendary
And even, when I'm gone, you're gon' see, my name live on
I'm legendary
And tomorrow will come and you'll see me through the sun
I'm legendary
A mission man
So many cowards wanna see me buried
I'm legendary
A mission man
Hail Mary
Hail Mary

[Verse 1: Chinx]
I'm on these niggas like a cheap suit
Harry Fraud gon' hold me down as soon as that beat loop
What's that talk bout?
Don't know what that walk bout
Bitches on my tip when I step in and when I walk out
I'm cold blooded
My stones flooded, my temperature drop
I take these lil niggas to school, just listen and watch
This that Coke-coke Boys music, you can use it
In your nose and in your veins
Fuck it we done killed the game
It's Chinx Drugz, you'se a half a man
Flyer than all our dogs, El Capitan
I do hit how I'm 'posed, raise a toast
Pull these niggas by their coats, it's that riot with that coke

[Hook: Mavado]
I'm legendary
And nigga when I'm gone you're gonna see my name in bronze
I'm legendary
And tomorrow will come and you'll see me through the sun
I'm legendary, I'm visionary
So many brothers wanna see me buried
I'm legendary, I'm visionary
Legendary, legendary

[Verse 2: French Montana]
All my diamonds flashin', go and grab a flick
Roll up and your bitch gone, magic trick
All the bitches staring, I'm talking 100 chains
Bitch I'm legendary, I'm talking hall of fame
Junior High to the league, rookie of the year
Hardwood floors every time I grab a chair
I ain't stingy, Montana got racks to share
Crocodile hoodie baby, let them stare
Bitch I'm back to balling, all my whips is foreign
I'm talking A-Team, no license, no insurance
No I'm ridin' clean, little cash fresh off tourin'
You know we bout that life, you niggas tellin' stories

[Hook: Mavado]
I'm legendary
And nigga when I'm gone you're gonna see my name in bronze
I'm legendary
And tomorrow will come and you'll see me through the sun

[Verse 3: Mavado]
Evil lurks in the dark, stick by yourself
I fight to death, this world know me as a fighter jet
Ball king, dive in with my (?)
Bout to feel five for real, never swept
21 gun salute for the soldier
For my fallen soldier
21 gun salute for the soldier
For my fallen soldier

[Hook: Mavado]
I'm legendary
And nigga when I'm gone you're gonna see my name in bronze
I'm legendary
And tomorrow will come and you'll see me through the sun
I'm legendary, I'm visionary
So many brothers wanna see me buried
I'm legendary, I'm visionary
Legendary, legendary
