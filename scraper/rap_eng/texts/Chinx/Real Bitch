[Verse 1: Chinx]
Broke bitch, tell ya story walkin'
Kid ain't mine ask Maury Povich
Spittin' game I'm a sharpshooter
Niggas running through the fire, I just walk through it
Cuz it really ain't a thang nigga
Came up but I'm still the same nigga
She want a dope boy, she don't want a lame nigga
Drop it down to the floor, pick it up, bitch hold it!
Trick I spin off in that Lotus
Bitch I'm the shit you ain't notice?
Bitch don't keep it 100, tell her gon' wit it
