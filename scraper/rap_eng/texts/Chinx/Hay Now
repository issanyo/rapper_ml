[Hook: Chinx Drugz]
Hit the shade on that window
Nigga lock them doors up, Hay Now
Lets get back to the money

[Verse 1:]
[Chinx Drugz]
Mink gon' build the best shoes, Alaxender
Stash box just to pack the Hummer
On a twelve foot yacht's where I park the Llama
Potential threat like your very first sign of cancer
Before rap, I was watching cameras
With that headshot, even mama's love wouldn't find you handsome

[Vado]
Woman mansions, beach house hamptons, dirty dancing
Cinnamon Timbs Stephen Corn Shearling enhance it
Pretty girl she'll answer
Just me and Chinx, I heard your girl some dancers (Wasup)
She said I'm alone too much
I keep two or three -shit I"m in the zone too much

[Hook: Chinx Drugz]
Hit the shade on that window
Nigga lock them doors up, Hay Now
Lets get back to the money

[Bridge: Chinx Drugz]
Hay Now
Moved all white off the playground
Nigga Hay Now
Get down and lay down

[Verse 2:]
[Chinx Drugz]
Nigga who sold it and then park it, gotta go through us
They dont talk transactions on the phone with us
Cause niggas been dropping double nickels
That was back when mercedes dropped the Double Nickel
Black and white ensemble I'm so official
Dropped the bag on em, coach guards got em going fishing

[ Vado]
I feel you, I come to smash niggas
Them niggas mad we bunch of cash getters
Might bump heads you funny ass nigga
They ain't got no bread, a bunch of ass betters
Cherry red drop red'll ll make his Dad jealous
No boy, you care less
Vado and Chinx, Coke Boys -we the best

[Hook: Chinx Drugz]
[Bridge: Chinx Drugz]

[Verse 3:]
[Chinx Drugz]
In the words of NY know I let them things fly
Drive slow as a diesel, observe to drop speed

[Vado]
Stuck up block dice games and c-los
Make a movie with an uzzi you should know

[Chinx Drugz]
I'm license with the four
All white, everything medaying
No training wheels, been pedaling

[Vado]
Benz that never ring, just talking
Ask a nigga where he going, said he just walking (Hay Now)
Hay Now, muhfuckas'll lay down
Get shot down or get sprayed down, like face down (early)
