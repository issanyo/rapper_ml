[Intro]
My country's national anthem

[Hook]
Nigga on weed, liquor, pills, and a perc (Yay!)
Little bitch with me tryna get this work
What the fuck they on?
I don't know what the fuck they on (I don't know)
A nigga gettin' high, all day and all night
Scared of the dark, nigga walk into the light
What the fuck they on?
I don't know what the fuck they on
I don't know what the fuck they on

[Bridge]
I don't know what the fuck they on (Yay!)
Coke Boy
I don't know what the fuck they on

[Verse 1]
Talk money, every day a dollar
Fuck niggas trippin, hoes wanna holler
Young nigga do that shit
Got my first half a brick had to move that shit
Say a prayer to the most high, no lie
Every nigga wtih me on fire, oh my
Talk money first, hoes second
Bricked up, gold necklace
Stare through the tint, see your hoe naked Bowflexin'
Talkin' about the grip better have mine off top
Fuck nigga trippin' burn him like that stovetop
50 racks in a duffel nigga
Word to mama, I don't fuck with niggas

[Hook]
Nigga on weed, liquor, pills, and a perc (Yay!)
Little bitch with me tryna get this work
What the fuck they on?
I don't know what the fuck they on (I don't know)
A nigga gettin' high, all day and all night
Scared of the dark, nigga walk into the light
What the fuck they on?
I don't know what the fuck they on
I don't know what the fuck they on

[Bridge]
I don't know what the fuck they on
I don't know what the fuck they on (Yay!)

[Verse 2]
Count a hundred racks when I feel like it
Nigga cuff his bitch, but I still hike it (still hike it)
Bossed up, gettin' tossed up
Nigga castrated, get your balls cupped
Touched paper on the wake up
Did a couple years on the wake up
Swear to God I was dope dealin'
Now I come through no ceiling
Talkin' about the grip, but have mine off top
Fuck nigga trippin' burn him like that stovetop
Spinnin' paper like a Ferris wheel
Never take a stand unless it's (?)

[Hook]
Nigga on weed, liquor, pills, and a perc (Yay!)
Little bitch with me tryna get this work
What the fuck they on?
I don't know what the fuck they on (I don't know)
A nigga gettin' high, all day and all night
Scared of the dark, nigga walk into the light
What the fuck they on?
I don't know what the fuck they on
I don't know what the fuck they on

[Outro]
I don't know what the fuck they on
I don't know what the fuck they on
I don't know what the fuck they on
I don't know what the fuck they on
