Here me say
You ain't going nowhere yet you feel you moving
Straight on top of straining what that wind done blew in
You can't get right, your pockets super light
And I'm on top of mine, I ain't wasting my time
You can't get right, your pockets super light

I made my way up in the gizame
And then I crept up on some chizange
Thats right, for the love of money
Man fuck boy ain't never took nothing from me
Married to the game but we ain't throwing racks
Use it for the dope you been a question mark all your life
And Mr. Officer I know my rights, mad cause I spent his whole salary on frozen ice
Longest days, the coldest nights, coke boys run New York nigga sure you right
And the riot still a gizame, act stupid chopper knock off half your brizain

You ain't going nowhere yet you feel you moving
Straight on top of straining what that window blew in
You can't get right, your pockets super light
And I'm on top of mine, I ain't wasting my time
You can't get right, your pockets super light

Caught a key of cain, went down that drain you thought you came up in the game
That ain't your lane, it ain't the same you think it's suicide you try to drink away the problems
Every which way you go that black cloud will follow
My money long, my barrels hollow
You'd get it too if you knew that same shit that I knew
But you don't so your next thing is catch a hymnal
But you ain't built for that the boys will have you singing high notes
Navy blue twirler with the red guts
Ain't no such thing as love for money man that there's lust
Damn, your ship ain't moving
You can't get right, You can't win for losing

You ain't going nowhere yet you feel you moving
Straight on top of straining what that window blew in
You can't get right, your pockets super light
And I'm on top of mine, I ain't wasting my time
You can't get right, your pockets super light
