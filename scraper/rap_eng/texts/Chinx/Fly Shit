[Intro]
Boy, I'm on that fly shit, boy, I'm on that fly shit
Boy, I'm on that fly shit, boy, I'm on that fly shit
Boy, I'm on that fly shit, boy, I'm on that fly shit
Boy, I'm on that fly shit, and I encourage you to try it

[Hook]
Every time I dip in they gon’ give me love
Every time I visit shawty hit me up
All about them digits I can't get enough
They know how I'm living, boy, I live it up

[Verse 1 – Chinx]
Bust it open, pop it, twirl it, hold up, shawty, hold it
Buy my tickets, baby, every nigga with me holdin'
Get that money all the time, stand my ground, no drop no dime
In that DB9 I'm flyin', hundred reasons why I fly
On that money gang, fuck them lames, what the business be like
Snatch your lady he might, never leave my pivot, ball over these bitches
You never on that fuck you call that heavy on that pimping
Coke boy, cold boy, shame how niggas did him
Left him on that corner stinking ain't no longer with us
Say you're on the other side, ain't 'bout bread well never mind
I be hopping off that plane just to hop up in that ride, boy, I'm flyin'

[Hook][x2]

[Verse 2 – Chinx]
Kitchen table with that bird, we chop it like lumber
Hundred round drum, give him the whole hundred
All my diamonds they be glaciers, call me biz, I got the vapors
Bended corners in that scraper, with my team we pulling papers
Paper, plotting mega money heist
If this whip could talk it'd tell you fucking right
Probably on that blue dot, probably on the molly
Nigga yo ho choose me, I ain't commit robbery
Youngin kill that noise, I can't hear you niggas anyhow
Whether be my jewelry or my reefer it be really loud
Played the underdog for years, but them niggas feel me now
Your number one coke boy, for sure boy
Boy, I'm on that, boy I'm on that

[Hook][x2]
