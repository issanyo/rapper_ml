[Hook – Chinx & Flip]
Bitch, I told 'em I was all about that bacon
Got that Maserati swerving and your bitches for the taking
Flip, tell 'em
Bitch, I told 'em I was all about that bacon strip
Bacon still caking, we them Coke Boys bitch
Chinx, tell 'em

[Verse 1 – Chinx]
I'm from the other side where other guys don't walk through much
Hopping on the money like whatever they need another ten they come to us
Scared niggas see us, get them bubble guts
My gang real, just turned down my fifth deal
Styling on the majors, whips in different flavors
Driving with no papers, yeah, I'm lawless
Fans might recall this, said you put that work in that little one, I don’t recall it
Bitches on my tip, prezys in my grip, traffic in that trip
Got you bitch strapped by that waist, bet she bring back all the, bring back all that grip
I swear to God I wake up tripping, money talking to me
Interrogation DA debate and they offer for me
My little homie stepped wrong and got his cap peeled
The shooter sped off in that 12 [?] with them black wheels
That's how the gang turn, lanes burn
Real niggas get money, bitch niggas can't get shit from it

[Hook]

[Verse 2 – Flip]
They call me Coke Boy Flip, see I’m addicted to stunting
Get em in by the bricks and I break them down into onions
You know the block is still moving, 22 packs in a week
That's 22 [?] grams each, six hundred a piece
I'm 'bout my bacon, word to my momma
I Katrina these niggas, you know Louisiana
So you don't wanna get caught up in that [?]
As I knock on your door with that four four with the intentions to get paid, ah
And when I'm done, I had that Masi' swerving
[?] that’s five fifty, had them bitches slurping
And that’s for certain, so don’t get it confused
I'm a coke boy, bitch, and I'm oh so rude

[Hook]
