(Intro)
Aye Chinx
I remember countin my first million dollars
I turn around, look at my bitch
She lookin at me, I’m lookin at her
Guess what i told her?
You ever suck a millionaire dick?
Guess what she said

(Hook)
Oh oh oh!
Come on fuck me baby
Like you wanna
Like you love me
Don’t judge me
Tell yo friends come on over
Let me bend em over
I wanna fuck you and yo friends
Smokin granddaddy drinking Henn
Back of the Ghost, dark tints, come and fuck me baby

(Verse)
Uh! Still reppin farock where the ball drop
My front lawn is the car lot
Street sweeper, get the floor mopped
I ain’t scared of nothing but the feds at my door knockin'
Few commas, buried dollars, large wallet
She shaped like a E class but got poor mileage
Niggas slippin like the floor polished
Never seen the money, they was farsighted
Pull up on yo bitch and draw first blood
Funny with a pair of shoes all purged up
They ain’t matchin with my words does
Been that nigga before I knew what the first was
Pants sagging, brick grabbing, mink draggin
I chase paper, show nuff, last dragon
These niggas ass backwards
Run up in this dirty bitch with the bad package

(Hook)
Oh oh oh!
Come on fuck me baby
Like you wanna
Like you love me
Don’t judge me
Tell yo friends come on over
Let me bend em over
I wanna fuck you and yo friends
Smokein granddaddy drinkin henn
Back of the Ghost, dark tints, come and fuck me baby

(Verse)
Hunnit round banana clip when i peel on em
Hunnit thou, Shawty ass fat, you can land on it
Chesse, Chinx Drugz, my nigga harry
My Jamaican niggas kill you for a pound of Ari
Rap game slow up call my connect
Got that crinack, boy is all the chef
Ball like JR, scope on the AR
Money gon last in my pocket like an 8 ball
I seen dreams turns 25 to life
I might cash 25 tonight
Real niggas mouth closed, ball like gauchos
Black Ghost, white hoes

(Hook)
Oh oh oh!
Come on fuck me baby
Like you wanna
Like you love me
Don’t judge me
Tell yo friends come on over
Let me bend em over
I wanna fuck you and yo friends
Smoking granddaddy drinkin henn
Back of the Ghost, dark tints, come and fuck me baby

Yea, Coke Boys
Cheeze D-i

(Verse)
She wanna fuck me baby, suck me crazy
Throw it back like Brady, blow M80’s
Ran through a molly, got a nigga on the waving
While them other niggas tryna cuff like they stay there
Bend that thing over, lil thighs kinda shakin
Ass kinda cakin, short like Pinky
Wrists and the pinky, jewels with the minky
You know I make the money, never let the money make me
Know I blow dough, tell them hoes get a hanky
See them thirsty hoes? now them hoes trynna drank me
Coke Boys ballin, tell drugs set the pick
Ask yo bitch how it feel to suck a rich nigga dick

(Hook)
Oh oh oh!
Come on fuck me baby
Like you wanna
Like you love me
Don’t judge me
Tell yo friends come on over
Let me bend em over
I wanna fuck you and yo friends
Smoking grand daddy drinkin Henn
Back of the Ghost, dark shades, come and fuck me baby
