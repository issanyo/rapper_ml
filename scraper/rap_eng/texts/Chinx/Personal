[Verse]
Uh, made it out the bottom, that was long realin'
Thank God I ain't make it to that Ford buildin'
But now I got the chance to do it big on 'em
I know gluttony's a sin but I'ma pig on 'em
And I won't miss a red cent, scrapin' every inch
Watchin' all this cash, watch the paper raise
Couple homies pray my dreams stop
So I had to pull back from them niggas like a slingshot
But hell, we was off the same block
Neighbors locked, I put numbers on them green dots
See all the hatin' only make 'em cop another coupe, ring, watch
I seen all the snakes surface when the cream crop
It kills 'em that they bitches wanna kick it off
Hoes goin' Hulkamania, they rip it off
Send that trick back, missin' walls
Even Stevie seen Ms, what your vision cost?

[Chorus]
I just tryna get it how a youngin' had to get it
Can't apologize for the way them niggas feelin'
All God's plan and it wasn't my decision
I swear to God that it wasn't my intention
But you take it personal (Don't take it personal)
Don't take it personal (Don't take it personal)
Don't take it personal (Don't take it personal)
Don't take it personal (Don't take it personal)
