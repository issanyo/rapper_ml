[Hook: French Montana]

Make money live comfortably
Never chase the money let the money come to me
One night and she ain't trynna leave
Look at what the game done to me
Fo-five that’s by my side
Down to ride my niggas holdin' me down
Few bottles, few hoes, and me
But nigga ain't no heart in me

[Verse 1: French Montana]

I’m sipping on codeine
White ghost so clean
White hoes OD'ing
Got the hood on lean
Still dippin' in that 'lac
Grippin' on that strap
Sipping on that yak
Pimpin' and I rap
You niggas got that bad batch
One leg you half-assed
Coke Boys that anthrax
Shotta boy, Mad Max
Hoppin' out like there it go
Bad bitch her head low
Mansion on her earlobe
Head dumb, weirdo
Purple drank I stay high
Through the lane like A.I
Ballin' like Isaiah
Bad Boy no way out
Three hoes from Creole
Only like my P.O
Ray Bans on my eye
Coke Boy 'till I die

[Hook: French Montana]

[Verse 2: Chinx Drugz]

My niggas on it
Pistol on me
Fuck nigga this your issue homie
All this drama on my brain
Lawyer about one hundred
This that shit that come with the game
Homies see the B's on the trunk
Count money in the meantime
Young nigga paid attention to them street signs
Couple homies screaming East Side
Two lanes bet the money come on each side
Coke flipping on these lames bout that stunt
Pulling fifty every month
Get your feelings hurt
Windows cracked roll slow up on a chump
Nigga know them Coke Boys
Niggas got that work

[Hook: French Montana]
