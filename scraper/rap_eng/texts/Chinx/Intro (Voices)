[Intro: French Montana] Chinx... Montana... ash to ashes... dust to dust... made niggas... showed you how to get high... enjoy life... nobody told you to OD nigga... cocaine riot... part 3... haahhh

[Hook]
Voices in my head keep telling me.. to go n get the money, go n get the money
Voices in my head keep telling me.. to go n get the money, go n get the money
Voices in my head keep telling me.. to go n get the money, go n get the money
Voices in my head keep telling me.. to go n get the money, go n get the money

[Verse 1: Chinx Drugz]
I be throwin'up my gang just me and my dogs
Money on my brain, keep saying what I want
Manicure my play, middle finger them cops
CokeBoys run New York, nigga we was poppin' nahh
It's a new day up on the east side
Tell them niggas watch their tone we get the peace pie
Murder in the air but we gon' keep silence
See them diamonds glaring like a street sign
Bank heavy roll, shorty ready to roll
When we off in that spot, we be letting it go
Fresh over that block, took over that lane
Can't chill cause the voices in my head, they be telling me (they be telling me to)

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Chinx Drugz]
Bank stopped, I'm all in, top back and fall in
Roll it on these pinhead, niggas bowlin'
Afghan in my swisher, ménage we switchin
At my own discretion, I don't need permission
Smell like that kitchen, flash backs of that stove
Tore the pussy up she had flashbacks of that O’s
Getting burned like forest fire, I'm yelling more fire
Glock shells getting sold to the first buyer
Hard Knock we been there, now all whips is this year
Came up out them cuffs, I done switched up my wrist wear
I be blowin' money presidents goin to thin air
Ain't enough in your account if you know what's in there

[Hook]
