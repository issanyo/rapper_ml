[Hook (KQuick)]
Maybe if I didn't get caught up in the life
Maybe if I didn't run out so fast
Maybe if I'd just slowed down at the light
Maybe you might, maybe you might just still be here
You might just still be here, but that's just maybe

[First Verse (Chinx Drugz)]
You never see the picture through a fools eyes. When you know your people you ain't gotta choose sides
From the bottom we done came up and the time they made us wait, we vowed to make them niggas pay up
I swear to god we had a dream, eventually we'd blow the graceful covers of them magazines..
Excuse my feelings, I just need a moment...
Just some personal shit I need to get on with...
You see I try to block it out, but you was bout to kill the game and them niggas couldn't do nothing about it
Blow out the smoke then I take a swig, just reflecting on the things we said as kids..
Maybe if I wasn't incarcerated I'd have been there with you to fight the devil, and then you'd probably made it
But then you caught a head shot, and now my heart is nothing but a dead spot

[Hook (KQuick) Ad-Libs (Chinx Drugz)]

[Second Verse (Chinx Drugz)]
Bottom to the top top to the bottom see we rolling in the game if he my nigga then I got em
Certain things in life just go unexplained, death's a sure thing, kids left to hold your name
This' for my homies on the other side, we see you short but try hard not to fuck up my stride
Sheisty bitches won't fuck up my high put the key in the ignition and jump in the ride
Just tryin to find a peace of mind, this nasty nigga 's trynna take a piece of mine
Lifes a sheet of paper just stay in the lines, maybe if I'd read between the lines you'd still be alive...

[Hook (KQuick)]
Maybe if I didn't get caught up in the life
Maybe if I didn't run out so fast
Maybe if I'd just slowed down at the light
Maybe you might, maybe you might just still be here
You might just still be here, but that's just maybe
