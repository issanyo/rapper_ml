It feels like the sky is opening, and we're entering. You're all I ever wanted baby. I'm always gonna be here, when you need me, when you get tired of them suckas. Uhhh

Now you know I'm on that molly
Told her I'm not tryna polly
I'm just lookin for somebody to ride
Baby tryna leave this party
We can roll up on some molly
Shorty I'm just tryna blow out ya back
Ya back. Ya back. Ya back. Ya back. Ya back. Ya back

[Chinx Drugz:]
She got that feeling, feeling
Shorty be twerking off the pill
Her clothes start peeling peeling
This ain't no joke these girls for real
She touched the ceiling ceiling
She bought that party here for real
I call her molly molly
She brought that party here for real

[Charlie Rock:]
We started talking
She said she do mollies
Fresh outta college
And offered to party
And you know we la di da di
And we la di da di
And we be on them mollies too

[French Montana:]
She said she graduated college
Now she strippin for some dollars
Told her don't put no more milage on ya thang
Let me help me with ya problems baby
No more window shoppin'
She said Frenchy put some diamonds on my hand

[Chinx Drugz:]
Soon as she roll up roll up
I snatched her by her arm and peel
She touched my pole up pole up
Now that there's her spit shine for real
She starts to shiver shiver
All threw her body she feels chills
I know she want it, want it
I pinch her so she knows it's real

[French Montana:]
