Ride up on the corners I step foot
Saw the money I was right next to it
Had the haters like how the hell he do it
Made it out the ghetto, glory hallelujah
Came up out the sewer
They ain't never show me how to hit a lick and split the profit with the fam
Most them niggas counterfeit never been authentic, they gon' fold when shit hit the fan
In the kitchens whippin' overtime
Caught the drip but it was overtime
Fell asleep and a nigga had a dream
Now I'm whipping foreign all the time
Hundred thousand dollars in the duffle
Stashing over hundred in a muffle
Had to find out where to put the pieces
Just to finally see my day to ball

Gotta learn it on your own, how to get rich nigga

Wish I had a step by step book
On the roads and the path's you took
When you loss or how'd you get it back
Run for it, then it fall up in your lap, yeah
How to get rich nigga, how to get rich nigga
How to get rich nigga, how to get rich nigga

[Verse 2: Chinx]
Done went from holes in my sneakers to counting knots
Franklin and Jacksons we count them out
Used to put the money in the mattress
Now we put that in my safety deposit box
Bet yo last I'ma kill em, stack the cash by the ceiling
2 hundred on the dash, when I pass know you feel it
Missing rack when I'm steering
Certain shit they never told us, had to figure out on my own
Now we winning by a landslide, got the plans right, did it all alone
Stand up, never snitch hitta
Stand firm, never switch hit it
All this game, I done gamed on em niggas

Can't nobody teach you how to believe in yourself, even when no one don't
Can’t nobody show you how to love it
