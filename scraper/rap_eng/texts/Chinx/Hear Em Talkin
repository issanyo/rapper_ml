[Hook][x2]
I hear these niggas talk, but I don't hear 'em
Ho get off my line
Hold up, we sippin', bad bitch I'm pimping
Got this shit wrapped, you can say I'm gifted

[Bridge]
Game off in that crate
Fresh off of that stove
Talking about that bank
Get it on that roll
Ground order my drink
Sit back I'm low
In case they ain't heard
Tell them niggas we on

[Verse 1 – Chinx]
Coca cola mixing, boy whip it, cream it
Your bitch on my line she think a nigga dreaming
Boy my money grown and all your digits free me
Wide body Benz but the tire skinny
Money busting out east side
Couple homies screaming east side
All them off schools we hot
All them foreign cars we drive
Shawty soak me up like that mop
All this money got me pumped
I'm talking about Reebok
She be going down I be yelling timber
[?] no one by no money than I don't remember
Fresh up off the jet now I'm center stage
Vacations, white sands, but my linen beige

[Hook][x2] + [Bridge]

[Verse 2 - Bynoe]
I put on for my city did it for my dawgs
They ain't never coming back, that's behind the wall
Crack the dutch, roll something for a player
At the top it's just us, motherfuck a hater
Diamonds Blu-ray, stones HD
Been through hell and back, how could you hate me
Purple in my cup, bitch I'm poured up
Got my feet well planted, bet I won't budge
Different color bands all around the kitty
Went from cellblock 4, now I'm next to Diddy
Trick get off my line if you ain't talking money
Kevin Hart ass niggas, you can't get funny

[Hook][x2] + [Bridge]

[Verse 3 – Cokeboy Flip]
I heard them niggas talking but can't seem to hear
Money on my mind, nigga got tunnel vision
Broke nigga nah, I don't fit the description
Cokeboy Flip, go and get with 'em
Swerving off in that thang
Champagne for the pain
Move a whole bunch of cocaine nigga
Rice Squad be that gang nigga
I don't know what you claim
But I rep mine to the death
Plus I'm a coke boy nigga
Go and show some respect
You worry about what we doing, why we keep it moving
Ain't no room for losing homie we improving
My presence felt, it got your woman choosing
Cause she addicted to winners, that's what I'm doing

[Hook][x2] + [Bridge]
