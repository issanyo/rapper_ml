[Hook]
Came up out the block, grinding for a spot, but you would never know it
Foreign with the drop, stash with the Glock, but you would never know it
Crept up out the spot, slid out with your thot, you would never know it
You would never know it, you would never know it
Nigga wouldn’t even understand even if I told you
Nigga wouldn’t even understand even if I told you
Nigga wouldn’t even understand even if I told you
Nigga wouldn’t even understand even if I

[Verse 1]
Nigga used to hustle in the cold tryna get mine
Take it off the stove, then we take it up the road when the whip drop
All about the dough, see them hoes on the flipside
Best friends turned to foes, niggas switched sides
Need mine even when it’s slow money
No money better than the dope money
Trust no nigga hold the dope for me
Fuck nigga wouldn’t hold door for me
Young nigga ten toes down when the strip hot
Nigga die by the same set of codes nigga live by
Pull up to the block with the whip doors up
Nigga looking down, now he ten floors up
Fit balmain with the grip rolled up
Getting off the plane and the whip roll up
From the floor to the ceiling, truckload for the dealers
3rd strike, shawty took an L when he blew trial
Tell me how he still thank lord for appealing

[Verse 2]
Wouldn’t understand how you flip that work
Wouldn’t understand how you did that first
Wouldn’t understand how you came up in the game
With his ten toes down all up in that dirt
Could’ve been worse, nigga could’ve got murked
Always praise god, never made it to the church
Nigga spend his whole life tryna find love
When the shit goes wrong, nigga that shit hurts
Pull up to the spot in a four wheeler
Up in here looking like a dope dealer
Never hit another lick for no nigga
I was told if you want it nigga go get it
Nigga go get it
Middle finger to the judge and them ho niggas
Coming with their hands out, I don’t know niggas
I used to grind every morning, I kept that work in my sock
I used to scramble the yay, move that shit right off the block
I used to jam on the stove, flick my wrist in that pot
I might be serving you bricks, I might be sly with your thots
