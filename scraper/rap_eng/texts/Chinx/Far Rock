I mean like Far Rockaway isn't for nobody shit so I embrace me so whatever I embrace it works out  we Anit never had nothin ...


[Verse 1 – Stack Bundles]
Most niggas is cowards, hide behind the record like a shield
Mention my name and you gon’ get killed
Blood spilled for real, you niggas better chill
Cause I solemnly swear to get uglier than Seal
Not behind my back
Only thing I got in common with ass is I clap
Shut up, get up, bet it burns more than your sit ups
What you ate, you spit up
Fuck your outfit up, blood all over your number nines
That cute shit you was saying wasn’t funny to mine
We dead ass serious
So that smack battle rap shit will get you left dead ass serious
Look at me, don’t I look like a nice guy?
I walk around with your head priced high
Niggas playing theyselves like suicide drills
Russian roulette with a TEC, you know suicide kills

[Verse 2 – Chinx]
Dick up in his ear, fuck what you heard
Changed up the pitch, couldn’t hit the curve
Bum nigga go and pick a curb
Shawty wasn’t lit so I hit the swerve
Booty knocking over tables, that’s an ass-fault
Touchdown, nigga hit it on the asphalt
V foreign whip came with a passport
Counting straps like I’m tryna rub a rash off
Caught slipping and he froze up
Never pimps down, hoes up
Head shot, now his toes up
Represent your hood nigga, throw it up
