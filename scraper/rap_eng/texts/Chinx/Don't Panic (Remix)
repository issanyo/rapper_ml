[Intro - French Montana]
Don't panic, nigga don't panic
Don't panic, nigga don't panic

[Verse 1 - Chinx]
Heard he fallin' off like a muffler
Started looking like a customer
We laughing straight to the bank
I just dropped three pills in the thing

[Bridge - French Montana]
Don't panic, don't panic
We just getting started nigga don't panic
Real niggas getting cake
Watch the fake niggas hate
Don't panic, don't panic
We just getting started nigga don't panic
Don't panic, don't panic
We just getting started nigga don't panic

[Verse 2 - Chinx]
Slide on your bitch like I got a warrant
Then a nigga hit it ASAP, no warning
If you're a freak let them titties hey
Imma take it to the hole if I get the lay
With some hands at the telly talking four cornish
It’s young and do his thing talking folk XXX
I’m talking way before LJ
Pass it to my niggas like Elway
Tryna catch a wave tell her twerk some
But when I get mad tell her serve some
Them Coke Boys run the whole city
Just a couple niggas like I told Diddy

[Hook - French Montana]
Shawty fell in love with a hustler
Man I took her from a buster
Niggas keep talkin' like they know something
I slide on your bitch like she on something
Don't panic, don't panic
We just getting started nigga don't panic
Real niggas getting cake
Watch the fake niggas hate
Don't panic, don't panic
We just getting started nigga don't panic
Don't panic, don't panic
We just getting started nigga don't panic

[Verse 3 - French Montana]
I won’t let up, sippin’ that Ciroc amaretto
Real bitches gon’ wait on me, fake bitches gon’ skate on me
Real bitches getting cake, fake bitches gon’ hate
She a model on the Gram
Getting swallowed was the plan
This young thug need four bitches
Take her to the crib take no pictures
Ass fat, let me get up on it
Bounce back early in the morning

[Hook]

[Bridge]
Don't panic, nigga don't panic, don't panic
