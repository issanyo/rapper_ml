[Hook]
You be paper chasing, you got your block on fire
Remaining a G until the moment you expire
You know what it is, and make something out of nothing
You handle your biz, and don't be cryin and suffering
Yeah you know I'm going in
Yeah you know I'm going in

[Verse 1]
Fifty racks up in that Louis, just made fifty more
Fifty rounds up out that Uzi, 'gest you hit the floor
You on your grind, you make your runs, you keep your pockets healthy
You hit your runners with that work, your block is rocking steady
That's what I'm talking about, lil' one do your thing
You stepping on that competition pursuing your game
Thirty on your wrist, about eighty on your sterling
You got them haters sick, they finna hurl up
You pray to God you keep your focus, never go insane
Make each and every dollar count and stack all of your change
But them jackers they ain't jacking that shit that you say
They catch you slipping, line you up, that chopper hit your brain

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
All this water on me make these bitches go insane
Workaholic make my donuts with that coffee man
I'm stepping out, work, I'm stepping on
Inquisition for that paper probably call my mo-, call my mobile phone
You fuck around, them killers put your shit up on a curb
Knock your melon off your neck, your days have been disturbed
Cross [?] we grow up back to back in front that venue
Leave with your chick right in that whip, I cut that like a [?]
Balling so hard on these busters, think I need a ring
While you cramping on that locker room, I'm in the game
They need to know I'm crushing everything within my range
My jewelry dripping and that candy paint, you see them stained

[Hook]
