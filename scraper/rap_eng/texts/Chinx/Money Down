[Intro :]
This Is How We Feel
When You Dealing With A Nigga Thats Real, Real For Real
I be getting ready to get down date a nigga got heads  to take
I just started a nigga got bread to bake

[Hook: ]
And I don’t ever trust these bitches
When they tell me they gon’ always be around
If I don’t know nothin’ else , I know the money down (x3)
If I don’t know nothin’ else , I know the money gonna always Stay down, Stay Down
Never going Broke

[Verse 1: Chinx]
Got The Game by the throat
Young nigga use to hustle in the cold
Now I hope off the plane to the boat ,the money stay down cause i stuffed it to the floor
Pull up with the top back, Nigga Amber Rose
Couldn't Fit a G's Shoes couldn't Stand in Those (Yay)
Take A Nigga Bitch Hit it out the park
Come around third, Now I'm sliding home


[Hook: ]
And I don’t ever trust these bitches
When they tell me they gon’ always be around
If I don’t know nothin’ else , I know the money down (x3)
If I don’t know nothin’ else , I know the money gonna always Stay down, Stay Down
Never going Broke

[Verse 2 : Zack]
And They Just wanna see us fall

[Hook: ]
And I don’t ever trust these bitches
When they tell me they gon’ always be around
If I don’t know nothin’ else , I know the money down (x3)
If I don’t know nothin’ else , I know the money gonna always Stay down, Stay Down
Never going Broke
