[Flight Attendant]
La musica de Harry Fraud

[Verse 1: Chinx Drugz]
Look, money bussin' out my pockets, I ain't never lie
Niggas rollin' with you but they never ride
Seems like I'm caught up in the devil's eye
Father I'm gon' need your guidance
I figure private flights just to change the climate
Riot be the Squad, Coke be them Boys
Fuck around a hundred shots'll get deployed
Been stylin' on these niggas, I been wavy since
Take a seat ladies gents
See these niggas plottin' through Mercedes tints
You are now in tune with the Harry Fraud Chinx Drugz extravaganza
We some wild cowboys swag on Bonanza
I been through hell and back, jail time, death of Stacks
Now these features and these shows got me countin' hella' racks
I lost it all in one roll and told em' bet it back
Shooters wit' me hit you in your head and back tell em' that
You niggas perpetratin' my niggas is paper scrapin'
You want the whole world to gain but you came with nothing

[Hook: Chinx Drugz]
I ain't a fan of the past man it's now or never
I got a whole lot to gain better now than never
I analyze the game through the cloudy weather
I forced my way up in the game they weren't tryna let us

[Verse 2: Chinx Drugz]
I push up on your bitch smellin' like Bvlgari
Polo'd down more horses then a car lot of Ferrari's
I'm mashin' on em, no apologies or sorry's
Loui loafers on them piso's, Crackers call me gnarly
I'm a certified boss money, player money, like cake we get it in layers
When you this fly you experience a bit of turbulence
Weeding out these sucker niggers like some kind of herbalist
The game is just my playin' field and I'm at the 30-yard line
Bout to go in for the kill, I'm the driver at the wheel
Throwin' money in the sky you don't know how it feels
Swear to god my whole like feels like I'm on a pill
With a little bit of lean now it's bulging out his jean's
Rap game ain't been the same since I stepped up on the scene
My jewelry clean, not my money though
These niggas hate me but they baby mothers love me though

[Hook]
