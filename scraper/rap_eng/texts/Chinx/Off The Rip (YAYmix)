[Hook: Chinx]
They only respect the money and the violence nigga
Swerving with your bitch, yeah I’m sliding with her
Stashed with them thangs full of cop killers
Moving in the thang with the drop ceiling
Young nigga top billing
Oh me, oh my my
Cook dope, gon’ need more quinine
40 knock his head off
Drop top V, nigga sped off

[Verse 1: Bynoe]
Drop top V, a nigga sped on him
You be gone by tomorrow when the bread on him
Broadstreet bully on ‘em
Never run that, they know the boy got the fully on him
Peanut butter and the oatmeal
Came home shitting like I had four deals
Cut the dope with the quinine
Then sit it in the rice, now it’s quiet time
You know Riot still the gizzang
Started with an eighth made it to a whole [?]
Any disrespect get met with aggression
Lay on em, knock his head off with the Wesson

[Hook: Chinx]
They only respect the money and the violence nigga
Swerving with your bitch, yeah I’m sliding with her
Stashed with them thangs full of cop killers
Moving in the thang with the drop ceiling
Young nigga top billing
Oh me, oh my my
Cook dope, gon’ need more quinine
40 knock his head off
Drop top V, nigga sped off

[Verse 2: Chinx]
All the hating, they gon’ get the car
Turn states ain’t gon’ get you far
All that praying ain’t gon’ do you nothing
Bitch [?] your dreams, got to choose it up
Four for the skis that’s a double O
Lick ten bricks for the motherload
Foreigns on the latest skates
Bitch niggas say it’s them like a layup shake
Same nigga fuck your bitch, give you a handshake
Four four long, then you’re scared straight
Copped all in cash we ain’t got to [?] credit
Out the back door in the bitch [?]

[Hook: Chinx]

[Verse 3: Meet Sims]

We never die, just multiply, extended off the hip
Me turn your [?] up until your blood start to come [?]
Your bitch gon’ bend it over, heard she fucking for these tips
Oh me, oh my, cook dope, gon’ need more [?]
Me 7 20 clubbing, fuck it up
Save nothing for later
This room look like confetti way we’re throwing up the paper
Look like a smoky forest when we’re lighting up the A
That’s your bitch on the couch and I might have to mash her taters
Wake up, back to turning dough and stacking bagels
Find a brand new dope house, [?]

[Hook: Chinx]
They only respect the money and the violence nigga
Swerving with your bitch, yeah I’m sliding with her
Stashed with them thangs full of cop killers

[Verse 4: Cau2G$]
Fuck you and whoever you with
My heart cold, I act like I shit platinum and [?]
I sparked it, guess I’ll finish it
My penmanship
Get niggas hyped and ignorant, it’s militant
Veteran, rookie in the industry, let him in
Independent, that’s how I’m settling, medaling
No chopsticks, to chop I bring the toolie out
Headshots for everybody, I’m giving noodles out
Oh me oh my my
In the drop top beamer, the nina
Little [?] while I took em to the cleaners
The cleanest, it’s felony hour you misdemeanors

[Hook: Chinx]
They only respect the money and the violence nigga
Swerving with your bitch, yeah I’m sliding with her
Stashed with them thangs full of cop killers
Moving in the thang with the drop ceiling
Young nigga top billing
Oh me, oh my my
Cook dope, gon’ need more quinine
40 knock his head off
Drop top V, nigga sped off
