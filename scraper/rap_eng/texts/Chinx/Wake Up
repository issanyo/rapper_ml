(Intro - Dafina Zeqiri)
Found myself picking up the pieces of me that you discarded
So this is what they talk about when they say broken hearted
Thought I was a together kind of person the type who had a handle
As fate would have it I'm exploding like a Roman candle
And it's pretty in the sky

(Verse 1 - Chinx)
Uh
From the biggest city even bigger dreamers
Pissy hallways way before we did arenas
Fresh up out my slumber then I praise the man
Lip seal for my homies never take the stand
Every time I thought I almost made it out
They stepped on my little campfire put it out
Wings broken will I fly again
Wake up in the morning then I try again

(Chorus - Chinx and Dafina Zeqiri)
Wake up wake up wake up wake up
And it's pretty in the sky
I done learned everything the hard way
Seems we done came a long way
Get up get up get up get up
And it's pretty in the sky
So whom everyone that it may concern
Your blessings are on its way you just wait your turn

(Verse 2 - Chinx)
If you aim for the stars and you miss your target
At least you know what the sky feel like
Never mind them roll with your gut
Pursue it only if it feels right
I hustled on the boulevard of broken dreams
But the ends I made never justified the means
You only get one shot ain't no second look
Wish I could take a trip and see how heaven looks
Gettin' of the black top was my motivation
Where the snakes play fam but ain't no relation
Get yourself together grandma told me "raise up"
Told me "get saved" I was tryna save up
Even though I'm dealing with the same devils
The feeling of this beat is so angelic
Pigs knock me tryna make a buck
But I be back after 4 years and a

(Chorus - Chinx and Dafina Zeqiri)
Wake up wake up wake up wake up
And it's pretty in the sky
I done learned everything the hard way
Seems we done came a long way
Get up get up get up get up
And it's pretty in the sky
So whom everyone that it may concern
Your blessings are on its way you just wait your turn
Wake up wake up wake up wake up
And it's pretty in the sky
And it's pretty in the sky

(Outro - Chinx)
Wake up wake up wake up
Wake up wake up wake up
