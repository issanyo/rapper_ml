[Intro]
What does this remind you of
La musica the hairy front

[Hook]
You can leave the lights off
I am going to hit it in the dark with the TV on
Middle of the night ya’ll
She will be knowing all the right spots to meet me on
Ain’t no stopping us now ain’t no stopping us now

[Verse 1]
The lights out tv on we be gone
Me and ma design my decor
Yea peace and fight yea we be the law
We make up reassuring who she adores
I’ll be laced up in the game lead the score
KD with great deeds I need awards
She be aboard big yachts because she was bored
Big watch second hand hover across
Come across these other broads
Who claim that they aren’t really fraud
I cut them off got uninvolved
But the only way when I call
Because I’ve seen a lot and want it all
Be at the spot so see you all about 3:00
We be here now so keep them coming
Getting money huh

[Hook]
You can leave the lights off
I am going to hit it in the dark with the tv on
Middle of the night ya’ll
She will be knowing all the right spots to meet me on
Ain’t no stopping us now ain’t no stopping us now

[Verse 2]
Can't’s stop a real nigga shorty
Purple in the weed got it fired up
Heads tied up on the bed post
She going to make it drop cause
I said so I will be burning money
Turning bread toasts because if this
Was a team boy you bitch
Would be the head coach
Diamond link trying to break the bank good
Lil bitch until I introduce her to the homies
I hate to say truck tried to kit me with
The hokey pokey fucking like I knew the
Bitch I ain't even know the hoe
Gold in the mouth like I know your houth
Fucked you and her three friends
Now a nigga passed out
Shorty loose the chicken with you and
Come and get a real winner
Coke boy all summer no top in the winter

[Hook]
You can leave the lights off
I am going to hit it in the dark with the tv on
Middle of the night ya’ll
She will be knowing all the right spots to meet me on
Ain’t no stopping us now ain’t no stopping us now
