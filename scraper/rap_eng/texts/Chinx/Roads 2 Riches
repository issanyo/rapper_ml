[Hook][x2]
I'm early for the fetti never late
Scraping off the platter like I never ate
Sliding on you haters like a set of skates
I'm on the road to riches in my Chevrolet

[Verse 1]
They say to reach success you gotta take a loss
Bag up a half a brick and wipe my mama’s table off
Swing turns on the coupe I'm living fast and furious
Vision blur, when you look that's just how bad his jewelry is
Shit, these niggas bi-curious
Half a homo, that's a no-no, don't we get a whole lot
See, it's either get this money or I'm picking your lock
Bad bitches with me when you see the Benzes roll up
Pour up, no lie, you know I
Style on these niggas like they've never been
Your swag is so irrelevant, I've been heaven sent
Coke Boys, get that capital, I be captain, scooping every cent

[Hook][x2]

[Verse 2]
A nigga living for the moment, all these bitches on me
Hard to get a breather, choking on that reefer
Blow it in your Caesar, Drugz on that extra grind
But you're number two ass niggas, you’s the next in line
Hottest in my city for a reason, change with the seasons
Me and Harry Fraud we got that shit that they be needing
Nigga fresh up off the stove, came up out that cold
Nigga off that corner, now I get it on the road
You only live once, nigga, make it count
If you judge a nigga, judge him by his bank account
Riot be the gang, and you niggas know that
That Coke Boy shit, you know a nigga hold that
