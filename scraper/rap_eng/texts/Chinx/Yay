Before I had the deal I was out here with the yay
We been counting money on them niggas
See before I had them bitches I was out here with the yay
We been counting money on them niggas
See before I had the digits I was out here with the yay
We been counting money on them
See before I had the deal I was out here with the yay
We been counting money on them
We some rich young niggas out the projects
Still counting money on em
Screaming fuck them other niggas in the process
Right, still counting money on em
We some rich young niggas out the projects
Still counting money on em
We some rich young niggas out the projects
Still counting money on em

[Verse 1]
I was counting money right in front the corner store
They was talking rap and I was only talking raw
Way before the deal a nigga went out on a tour
I throw that money in the air and tell that ho get on the floor
We was throwing rent out, they be pulling lint out
RIP to Bundles and it’s free my nigga  Penthouse
Pray I go to heaven ‘fore I ever go to hell
Riding with the blinker fully loaded, ducking 12
Pocket full of bands, stupid with them grams
Take it out the pot and wrap that bitch up in Saran
Riding in the ‘rari, party out at Diddy’s
Fuck them other hitters, know I do it for my city

[Verse 2]
Fresh up out the bottom, talking 30K a walk
40 on the wrist, another 100 on the drop
Open up the trap and watch the smokers do the wop
When that money coming in the feds closing on the shop
Standing on the couches, bottle Ace and bottle Rose
Doze off in the trap and had a dream about a Rolls
Got some niggas locked cause they done played it by the code
Made a killing off the block but now we do that off the stove
Don’t be tripping on the phone lines
Got a brick and turned my block into a gold mine
Nigga end up in a cell and I’ma hold mine
When they talking bout the money I be styling on them niggas like
