You're the man and'll prolly move back
To the same old hood
Run up on her while you slang
At the same old hood
Blow job but the pain all black
In the same old hood
Check me out with a bitch, she can pipe
For the same old hood

[Post-Hook: MeetSims]
Same old hood, for my city I showed up
Same old hood, all my niggas they rolled up
Same old hood, all my bitches they rolled up
Same old hood, all my haters
Same old hood, for my city I showed up
Same old hood, all my niggas they rolled up
Same old hood, all my bitches they rolled up
Same old hood, all my haters

[Verse 1: Chinx]
(?) from the dope sign now we on top
Same nigga that you (?) at the side back in 05
Started out when a nigga had nothin', I ain't even gon' lie
Nigga fronted me the work at the (?), realest nigga alive
Came up, changed up, now a nigga tryna make some waves
Grown up, blown up, now I'm tryna get my niggas all paid
Fuck nigga move up out my way
Run a meth run, I got a couple already
Never been a sinner, fuckin' piece and chain heavy
My niggas from the block and we bleedin' out heavy
Syrup on the blunt had her leanin' already

(Shout out to my hood we done made it)
(Four Smith's raised and I grabbed your ass)
Keep talkin', niggas ain't bout nothin'
Told you back then we was really gonna make it
Interstate down, niggas still in town hatin'
My niggas said drive, I'll go anywhere you take me
Never touch a shot if I know I coulda made it
