[Intro]
(Hey, these niggas got different kinda problems man)
This ain’t a diss song (uh uh) this a bitch song
For all you hoe ass niggas
There’s something I want to tell you
There’s something I thought you should know
Yousa fuck nigga

[Hook]
Straight up, you got pussy nigga problems
Sho’ man, can’t help ya nigga
Straight up man, you got pussy nigga problems
Sho’ man
Ain’t nuthin’ but a G thang
I can see your G string
Nigga you soft
And that’s what the streets saying
Whenever we roll up
You just fold up
When shit goes down, down, you never show up
You’s a fuck nigga

[Verse 1]
Ah, these niggas never who they say they is
They never prove what they say they did
I’m not enthused with your latest shit
I came through with your favorite bitch
You got the problems of a pussy boy
Pull your skirt down, I can see your pussy, boy
Never G’d up, you ain’t ‘bout that
Get your juice took, gotta buy it back, you ain’t like that
Try to show up for some lame bitch
And you gonna get embarrassed right in front of that same bitch
Never poked nothing, never popped nothing
Every time it’s on, you screaming “it ain’t ’bout nothing”

[Hook]
Straight up, you got pussy nigga problems
Sho’ man, can’t help ya nigga
Straight up man, you got pussy nigga problems
Sho’ man
Ain’t nuthin’ but a G thang
I can see your G string
Nigga you soft
And that’s what the streets saying
Whenever we roll up
You just fold up
When shit goes down, down, you never show up
You’s a fuck nigga

[Verse 2]
Never got your feet wet, always getting G checked
Catch him in his G ride, scared to get his seat wet
Nigga know I come from the slums
Where the bums get the crumbs
When the shots rang, you the first to run
Cause see you in the trap, fiends get you for the work
When the boys rushed, you gon’ save your own self first
Real niggas to the front, that mean you in the back
Smoked your own, you ain’t gonna do nothing back
My niggas G’d though, put my feet up
Nigga D up, fucked your bitch cream
Niggas got you for the re-up
You’s a bitch what the streets told me
You ain’t never ever lived by the G code
You’s a fuck nigga

[Hook]
Straight up, you got pussy nigga problems
Sho’ man, can’t help ya nigga
Straight up man, you got pussy nigga problems
Sho’ man
Ain’t nuthin’ but a G thang
I can see your G string
Nigga you soft
And that’s what the streets saying
Whenever we roll up
You just fold up
When shit goes down, down, you never show up
You’s a fuck nigga

[Verse 3]
Look look, it’s a fact that you got bitch ways
So emotional exactly how a bitch play
Lean periods it’s over 6 days
Yea we see you boy on your Bruce Jenner ways
You’s a fraud and you know it
Probably getting treated like a broad and you know it
You on blast, I’m about to expose it
We know you got boobs we just waiting till you show it
Just a fuck nigga begging for attention
On my instagram trolling through my mentions
Fake niggas with the feminine intentions
Bout to put these pussy boys in detention

[Refrain]
Something I want to tell you
I been meaning to tell you this for a long time
Something I thought you should know
You’s a fuck nigga

[Hook]
Straight up, you got pussy nigga problems
Sho’ man, can’t help ya nigga
Straight up man, you got pussy nigga problems
Sho’ man
Ain’t nuthin’ but a G thang
I can see your G string
Nigga you soft
And that’s what the streets saying
Whenever we roll up
You just fold up
When shit goes down, down, you never show up
You’s a fuck nigga

[Outro]
Aye, if you the type of dude
That don’t talk about another nigga to a bitch
Cause you tryna fuck her
And you be like, “Aye baby
He be doing this, he be doing that”
And then you go to the club
And you see that same nigga
With that same bitch that you ain’t fuck
Then nigga, you got pussy nigga problems
