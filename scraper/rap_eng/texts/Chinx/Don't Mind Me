[Hook – MeetSims]
Racks on racks on deck when I come through, don’t mind me
Diamonds on my neck and on my wrist, don’t mind me
Pull up in a brand new drop and snatch your ho, don’t mind me
I’ma keep doing this shit until I go, don’t mind me
Racks on racks on deck when I come through, don’t mind me
Diamonds on my neck and on my wrist, don’t mind me
Pull up in a brand new drop and snatch your ho, don’t mind me
I’ma keep doing this shit until I go, don’t mind me

[Verse 1 – Chinx]
I slide all my checks up in that bank ‘fore I leave
Can’t see the hotel suite unless she came, photo ID
Niggas come for my neck so I keep sticks, you know my V
Only one I ever fear is God so I talk to him, on my knees
Get em up work, have blood on my hands
Nigga had to roll my sleeves
Sneaks with the shoelace missing
For that nigga rans’ nothing less than a bando on my feet
Pull the Ks out where y’all sleep
In a red Corvette with a red side grip
Nowadays nigga life goes cheap
Racks on racks on deck, drove off that lot, no signing
Young nigga from the east side, love from the G
Right nigga only see mine, so I creep
No clique, just 100 bands deep
Hoes tryna lock a nigga down
Plan A’s gon' get the Plan B

Pull up in a brand new drop and snatch your ho, don’t mind me
I’ma keep doing this shit until I go, don’t mind me
Racks on racks on deck when I come through, don’t mind me
Diamonds on my neck and on my wrist, don’t mind me
Pull up in a brand new drop and snatch your ho, don’t mind me
I’ma keep doing this shit until I go, don’t mind me

[Verse 2 – MeetSims]
24k on the neck piece
Shining like a Jack, nigga Stevie King thriller
Coke Corleone all white leather limousine tint
White Ross, panorama seats killer
Stacks on deck, finna bust up in the back
Rose bottle, bout to bust open the cap
Don’t mind me, I done came to fuck the club up
With a couple young niggas from the A
Top downs ridden by the wayside
Whip for the baseside, dribbling the baseline kicker
Before I hit the club, I’ma slide up in your bitch, that yay
Come and then she wing bone dinner
Remember back then we was all tryna get out the fiddy
And now they want in, you can stick out
These fuck niggas ain’t even made enough for the pay
In to send em back home with the kick out
Racks on racks on racks, drove off that lot, know I did
Young nigga from the streets, nothing but a G ride
Baby pick your spot before I creep
No clique just 100 rounds deep
Feds want to lock a nigga up
Ain’t worried cause they won’t find me
