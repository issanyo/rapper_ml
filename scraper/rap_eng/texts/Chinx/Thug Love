[Hook: Jeremih]
We was faded, faded, you got one thing on your mind
You wanna love me, love me, ooh, only for tonight
Maybe, maybe
When I put you on that hood shit, I could drive you crazy
I want you to tell me, tell me what you’re doing tonight
Tell me, tell me, oh baby, tell me, tell me
You know exactly what’s on my mind
You know what’s on my mind, you know what’s on my mind, yeah
So tell me what you’re doing tonight (talk to me)
Tell me what you’re doing, yeah, yeah, yeah
Don’t play around I know you never had it like this

Know I’m finna give it to you, finna give you some of that loving
Loving, loving

[Verse 1: Chinx]
I’m tryna love you ‘til you sweating, give me all you got left
We done started from the bottom, made it to the top step
I do, I do, all I do is dream about sex
With you, got you a nigga from the projects
Hold up, young nigga switching them lanes
I’m on my way to the dough
Shawty, let's charter a plane, anywhere you wanna go
When they talk that lame shit, I don’t entertain it
Fuck 'bout what they saying, you know I’m your favorite
Coke Boy shit, what you know about it?
Came a long way from the dope house
Now we on the sand with our toes out
Took her to the crib then we both got

[Hook: Jeremih]
Faded, faded, you got one thing on your mind
You wanna love me, love me, ooh, only for tonight
Maybe, maybe

Tell me, tell me, oh baby, tell me, tell me
You know exactly what’s on my mind
You know what’s on my mind, you know what’s on my mind, yeah
So tell me what you’re doing tonight (I mean)
Tell me what you’re doing, yeah, yeah, yeah

Loving, loving

[Verse 2: Chinx]
Me and you faded, sitting in the background, keep it lowkey
Pretty young thing, but she ride that tip like she a OG
You know what they say
Money can’t buy love, you can get it all free
She be right there when I roll out, she my codeine
Watch me pull off on that two door, comfy like I took my boot off
Your ex she a dub like a 2-O, niggas gon' hate but it’s cool though
Come kick it with a real one, foreign whip, she could steal one
She done fell in love with a hood nigga
Made it to the top and I’m still one
Go and hit the weed, let her zone out
Keep a dime piece on the phone line
We could let a whole day go by
Took her to the crib then we both got

[Hook: Jeremih]
Faded, faded, you got one thing on your mind
You wanna love me, love me, ooh, only for tonight
Maybe, maybe
When I put you on that hood shit, I could drive you crazy
I want you to tell me, tell me what you’re doing tonight
Tell me, tell me, oh baby, tell me, tell me
You know exactly what’s on my mind
You know what’s on my mind, you know what’s on my mind, yeah
So tell me what you’re doing tonight
Tell me what you’re doing, yeah, yeah, yeah
Don’t play around I know you never had it like this
I’m finna lay it down on you right quick
Know I’m finna give it to you, finna give you some of that loving
Loving, loving
