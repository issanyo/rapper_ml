[Intro: French Montana]
They say never, say it's all over
Just do it all over again

[Verse 1: Chinx]
Started small but it's over now
All them books didn't help slanging dope now
Started off hunting he toting now
She tryna hold on when it's over now
She see my face on them posters now
European drop with the chauffeur now
Addicted to the hustle and that you know
Never love you too much to let you go
When you making choices nobody coming to save you
When they all got they hand out man I hate it
If I tell you how I feel man I'll be reaching
Do it for myself dawg I don't need you
I just want to let you know even if they never let you know
Picture nigga balling picture bitches calling
Picture money stacked from the ceiling to the floor man
They don't like it
Pull up in that new and they don't like it
Do what you do man they don't like it
They don't like it at all

[Hook: French Montana]
Picture nigga balling, picture bitches calling
Picture money stacked from the ceiling to the floor man
They don't like it
Pull up in that new, man they don't like it
Doing what you do, man they don't like it
They don't like it at all
They don't like it at all

[Verse 2: French Montana]
If every nigga in your clique is rich your clique is rugged
Hating niggas gon live jealous until they kick the bucket
Nina Ross the only bitch I'll ever kiss in public
Got indicted now the DA talking different numbers
Lost in the shuffle ain't nowhere to turn
They don't want to hear you niggas ain't concerned
Never been a stranger to homicide
Whip drop top shorty stash Glock 40
Broke many nights on the money run
Praying for the day that the money come
Nigga chasing perc switch to killer shots
Halfway can if you live or not

[Hook: French Montana]
Picture nigga balling, picture bitches calling
Picture money stacked from the ceiling to the floor man
They don't like it
Pull up in that new, man they don't like it
Doing what you do, man they don't like it
They don't like it at all
They don't like it at all
