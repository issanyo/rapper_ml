[Intro]
I let it fall, my heart
And as it fell, you rose to claim it
It was dark and I was over
Until you kissed my lips and you saved me
My hands, they're strong, but my knees were far too weak
To stand in your arms without falling to your feet
But there's a side to you that I never knew, never knew
All the things you'd say, they were never true, never true

[Hook]
Promise always keep 100 strapped with 100 clips
Started from 100 dollars, tryna make 100 Ms
Lost 100 niggas, bought about 100 whips
Made about 100 visits, sent about 100 flicks
100, 100, 100, 100, 100, 100, 100 100

[Verse 1: Cheeze]
Your new mixtape, sour we break up on
Put that mac in his face, no make up on
Home invasions, your mouth we puttin tape upon
Blades through your forehead, no shape up on
Yeah, it's Cheeze, I'm the one that get my cakin' on
In the kitchen, pie flippin' with my apron on
I gotta have patience, but they taking long
They ain't got no cool, nigga breakin' on
100 bottles, 100 bitches
2 O's, 100 Swishers
Million dollar dream, blue dream wishes
Ice shining, tryna scheme with your misses

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Chinx Drugz]
Took took took the game by surprise, they ain't see us coming
See they tracks in the sand, got these suckers running
Fresh off this life from poverty, board that money train
Put 100 on your head, you can keep the change
I lost 100 niggas, gained zero friends
I'm six zeroes in, feel like I never came to win
Some call it ungrateful, I call it overdue
Double styrofoam cup with that purple juice
Leanin', big money schemin'
Dump tell stack I said what up, fuck 'em, I ain't lettin' up
Got the game by the testicals, gun range tested
SKs and the 50 Cals, quiet but my jewerly loud
My money went from Spud Webb to Manute Bol
I'm ballin' hot, these niggas luke cold
They don't want the money, that's why they run from it
If you a stand up nigga, then keep it 100

[Hook]

[Verse 3: French Montana]
My niggas put in work, shawty held me down
Hustlin paid the bills, karma came around
That fast money came, nigga, then I lost touch
When it sounds too good, nigga, I never trust it
From crabs in the bucket to them lobster tails
From the block to trynna get Madonna sales
They got keys from west, to hittin Key West
Thats a motherfucker, Delonte West
Gettin high off moll nigga, fuck niggas lame
Thats a hundred thou, trynna fix the pain
Niggas stole our style, trynna switch the game
Hoppin' out the shower, throw on a hundred chain
