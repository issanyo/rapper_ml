(Armed and dangerous X2)

[Hook:]
Yayo
Bunch of young niggas but they know we
(Armed and dangerous)
Came up from the bottom but they don't fuck with us ‘cause they know we
(Armed and dangerous)
Bunch of young fly niggas gettin’ money and they love it
‘cause they know we (Armed and dangerous)
Ya-ya-ya-yayo
Got my thing cocked aim it for the top
(Armed and dangerous)

[Verse 1:]
Young nigga flexin hoppin out the coop
Pull up at the kill you know I'm finna shoot
Either be a ball player rap or hit them streets
Past year the rap game starting to sound like me
Keep my thing cocked aiming for the top
Middle finger to the law fuck the cops
Push that drop, nigga
Most of the time I be high
Your bitch be all on my line
You might of had a shot but dropped the ball ‘cause nigga it wasn’t your time
Like I'm fish bowlin you see me
Been ballin’ in 3D
Never seen a money niggas been callin’ you Stevie
Young nigga chasin that bank
Now we entertainers, but we came up off the block moving yea yea yea

[Hook:]

[Verse 2:]
Baking with the bread I sit and watch the dough rise
Obvious I can see the hate in your eyes
Out the pen a nigga copped like 4 rides
Couple homies back stabbin' so I had to choose sides, true life
Hoes don't mean you well, friends want see you fail
I was trying to find God cause they gave me hell
Nigga just open your ears
You gone take in all this game
Got my thing cocked don’t get caught up in this aim
It's Coke Boy, you know boy, this pay back and you owe boy
Niggas hatin’ they dream killers, you want something then go for it
Off the back blocks where it's never sunny now
All my niggas lookin’ like money but they know we

[Hook: 2X]
