Part 1 - Chinx & Max

[Intro: Chinx & French Montana]
That's my nigga man, that's my bro
I spoke to him last night, drunk out his ass
It's hard to do this, and I ain't gon' lie
I can't do that shit now

[Verse 1: French Montana]
Yeah, Montana!
Soon as you came home, took you on tour
Leave the streets, do whatever for your lil boy
Fast money, bad bitches, livin' in a rush
Now worse when you love somethin' death can touch
Sometimes life hurt more than death homie
Locked up Max, took Chinx, I'm last one left homie
Told you Stack - died, did, done, lived that
You looked at me and laughed, you ain't care
I remember we recorded I'm a Coke Boy
You lit the city up, I told you get that dough boy
I mean we both from the bottom with the same dreams
That's why I felt the same rush when you copped your first V
Starin' at my phone waitin' for your phone call
I see your face every time I see your lil boy
Life pleasant, death peaceful, transition
That's the trouble some comin' where I'm comin' from
Why blood bleed memories nobody steals
Death leave heart ache, nobody heals
In my own zone drinkin' till I'm feelin' woozy
Knowin' I'ma die, remind me there ain't nothin' to lose

[Interlude: Max B]
It's some real shit right here, yeah. I feel like he feels as far as far as not being able to have your nigga there, me, Chinx and shit. Always know this B, you're blessed. You know I'm sayin'? And all you gotta do when you feel like that, look at my situation, you know I'm sayin'? Think of my situation nigga
*You have 60 seconds remaining.*

[Verse 2: French Montana]
Damn how to start this off
One time to the boss don, coke wave boss, damn
Gave my nigga seven-five, damn
They tried to kill my dog alive
Wavy, it's a law fightin' for your life
We live like it no tomorrow, I pray for you at night
Time flyin', it's been 7 years
While time flies fake friends disappear
Fast money, fast cars, lived it to the most
Penthouse, Zack, Chinx, Max, nobody close
Told you focus on the money, fuck the problems
But once you hit the Henny, you the wildest
Remember when you finger popped the joint
And found a condom in her? Haha, and you still hit her?
You crazy, they thought I was done when they locked you up
Haha, turn the city up
Tried to bury us but didn't know we were seeds
International superstars overseas
Despite all our obstacles, against all odds
Keep your eyes on the prize and your faith on God
Every week talk to your mother
I see your baby boy gettin' older
Until you get the appeal we gon' fight homie
Spit that Coke Wave Boys for life homie
Montana

[Outro: Max B's mother + (French Montana)]
(Just say a prayer for us, you ready ma?)

Oh father God we come to you right now. To bring Karim, aka French Montana, and Charlie aka Max B. Bring them both to the altar, Lord God, to give this to you. I give this to you, Lord God, to keep him safe as I know that you do each and every day lord God. We ask you to give them wisdom, to use in a good way, lord God that will help them in their future -- concernin' their children, their children's mothers, for their children are the future and their children's children are the future future. So father God, we ask you lord God to anoint their music, anoint their thoughts, their dreams, their aspirations, oh God. And to speak to them always oh God as we know that you do but let them know lord God that when you're speaking to them  that you already spoke to them and that you always speak to them. It's just a matter of them listening. So father God we ask to carry them through both separate situations under two different circumstances, lord God. And we ask you in your son's name lord God to allow them to apply whatever it is they need to apply in their life, lord God, to make it better for them. And better for the music world, lord God. In this we say, we pray, amen

(Thank you ma, hold on for a second ma)
You like that one?
(Yeah I loved that one ma)
I want to say one more thing

Part 2 - Paid For

[Intro]
Max, Chinx
Think about the times
Think about you sometimes
Think about the dimes
(La musica de Harry Fraud)
Know sometimes I'm goin' under

[Hook: French Montana]
You won't hustle, everything is paid for
She bust it open like I paid for it
Baby tell me what you came for
Make sure you won't leave without
Wanna see you smile
Do it, don't try
Designer shit, wanna see you fly
Live it up, thinkin' bout the time

[Verse 1: Max B]
Ayo, spark them phony fucks from deep
I'ma put them fucks to sleep, quarter million in my jeans
These bitches praise my dick
Penthouse, he in that six (oww) we in this bitch
They raided on my cuh
They takin' all my bucks, they be rapin' all my sluts (oww)
Maxie don't like him
They got me all tightenin', even papi got that 10
Yeah I hit you niggas with that shotty pump
Leave you on that potty slump, shittin' on yourself
I put them bitches in the ground
I flip them with the pound, I'm empty, I need another round

[Hook: French Montana]
Everything is paid for
She bust it open like I paid for it
Baby tell me what you came for
Make sure you won't leave without
Wanna see you smile
Do it, don't try
Designer shit, wanna see you fly
Live it up, thinkin' bout the time

[Verse 2: Chinx]
Look these niggas wishin' on a fallen star
Double park the Vanquish and hop into a different car
We spend money like a whirlwind
Chinx Drugz don't crack, smack a nigga heroin
Your girl went down and never came up
These niggas need to hang up
Three Jewish lawyers on retainer
These liars never tell the same story twice
Been a sucker all your life
Yellow gold stones dancin' off the lights, fuck your life
These niggas ass bent with life, don't touch the dice
Never felt the fire till you touched it twice
What's the price? Kush burnin', cruise control
Everyday's a big game for me like the Superbowl

[Hook: French Montana]
You won't hustle, everything is paid for
She bust it open like I paid for it
Baby tell me what you came for
Make sure you won't leave without
Wanna see you smile
Do it, don't try
Designer shit, wanna see you fly
Live it up, thinkin' bout the time

[Bridge: French Montana & Max B]
Awo, thinkin' bout the time
I think about you sometimes
Awo, thinkin' bout the time
I think about you sometimes

[Verse 3: French Montana]
Uh, thinkin' bout you, couldn't even sleep
Man thinkin' bout you, couldn't even speak
All the confusion had me in the Mosque Friday night
Tryna find a peace of mind but couldn't find a piece of mine
Moral to the story, the story got no morals
Cause the real gon' struggle while the suckers get the glory
It's a new day, she trippin' off a D'usse
Try and hit me with the lemonade when I met her drinkin' Kool-Aid
Tryna be rich and famous, showin' up to court twistin' fingers
If rap was a sport, we was ringers
Gotta lose it all just to make it, God giveth, God taketh
Strip you naked, shake the devil, get the cake

[Hook: French Montana]
You won't hustle, everything is paid for
She bust it open like I paid for it
Baby tell me what you came for
Make sure you won't leave without
(Fraud you a motherfucker)
Wanna see you smile (Max)
Do it, don't try
Designer shit, wanna see you fly (Chinx)
Live it up, thinkin' bout the time

[Outro: French Montana]
Oww, thinkin' bout the time
(Miss you my nigga)
I think about you sometimes (CB for life)
Ow, thinkin' bout the time
(Wave God, MC4, Zach)
I think about the time
Think about you sometimes
(La musica di Harry Fraud)
I think about dyin'
Haanh!
