[Hook: Chinx]
All about the gold, never stress, no problem
Can't believe a soul never trust nobody
Get it on your own nigga fuck the co pilot
Get up on the road, nigga bet the gold find him
Nigga go get it, huh
Nigga go get it
Go get it

[Verse 1: Chinx]
Ever since a youngin' as far as I remember
Nigga want to stand on my own two
When you slow it down, start to pay attention
Start to understand what you goin' through
Still fuck them niggas on the other side
Its only big enough for us, we don't coincide
3 different doors, choose your own fate
First ones death, don't go inside
Captivated by the grind, I'm a slave to it
Kill a nigga for a dime if it came to it
Back against the wall nigga down to scrap
When I thought I lost it all nigga found a trap
Like a DJ fiend screamin' mo' fire
Young nigga with the dream make it more top
Could have got lost in the dope spot
They don't know nothing and they know I'm...

[Hook: Chinx]
All about the goal, never stressin' no problem
Can't believe a soul never trust nobody
Get it on your own nigga fuck the co pilot
Get up on the road, nigga get the goal find it
Nigga go get it, huh
Nigga go get it
Go get it

[Verse 2: Chinx]
Ties on the field, kicking up dirt
Lost few close to the heart, love hurts
Sold your soul, nigga was it worth it
Jealous niggas speakin' third person
Cause you walked the shoes of a Pappy mason
Its your first or last name on the affadavit
Only way to get it was to boss up
Now a days life it don't cost much
Cause I wear a fake smile, do that make me fake
Cause I resemble Mike Brown, do that make me safe
Does this nigga got the crown, would that make me hate
Young niggas down to bang like the 808
Sub conscience block feel like its on hook
Cat in the freezer nigga, cold pussy
Coke Boy, USA dream team
From the black hole to the green screen

[Hook: Chinx]
All about the goal, never stressin' no problem
Can't believe a soul never trust nobody
Get it on your own nigga fuck the co pilot
Get up on the road, nigga get the goal find it
Nigga go get it, huh
Nigga go get it
Go get it
