[Intro: DJ SpinKing & Chinx]
Woo, uh
SpinKing, what up?
Yeah
Chinx, Coke Boys

[Hook: DJ SpinKing & Chinx]
Four finger dope ring
Yeah, you know that gold thing
Hoppin' out that drop top
In and out that non-stop
I switch lanes and get brain
And I ain't know that trick name
I switch lanes and get brain
My nigga, we done came up in the game
We done came up in the game
We done came up in the game
We done came up in the game

[Verse 1: Chinx]
Just left my bitch
Went and got me a new one
One up on these niggas, like the score 2-1
That pussy was pink, now it's a black and blue one
They can't build a case see
I've been killin' shit for too long
A nigga flyer than them G-5's, I done flew one
They hate that we done came up in the world like a newborn
Coke Boys in here, fuck niggas move on
That bitch certified, but you don't think she do wrong
My youngin' tote a 40, we don't fuck around with police
Bumpin' niggas up then they gon' leave out with it slowly
Niggas livin' fast, we gon' kill them niggas slowly
The whip been the coldest
Leanin' like a soda-codeine
I be on that brown, lil' shawty on the way
Roll up on them like I do 'em, pill 'em and it's spray
Back to back 6's like we tripped up on the dice
Gun up on me case they run up on me at the light

[Hook: DJ SpinKing & Chinx]
Four finger dope ring
Yeah, you know that gold thing
Hoppin' out that drop top
In and out that non-stop
I switch lanes and get brain
And I ain't know that trick name
I switch lanes and get brain
My nigga, we done came up in the game
We done came up in the game
We done came up in the game
We done came up in the game
