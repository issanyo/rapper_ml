[Verse 1: Chevy Woods]
You niggas got me fucked up right
I was on that corner, I was there all night
The way I was getting it up off that white
Ain’t nobody around here ever had that price
Like 50, I was seeing cash off Yayo
On my own shit, nobody on the pay roll
Seeing what I seen, change a nigga whole life
Shit they was getting theirs so I had to get mine
Like up all night, fuck that shit
Let a ho hold the work, can’t trust that bitch
Chest full kick then I rushed that shit
Whole thing down the drain, had to flush that shit
Fuck it, a nigga know how to get back fast
Have a couple niggas get some all black masks
Shit that's what happen when that money coming in
Police running, jack boys running in

[Hook]
Hold up, wait a minute
Know it ain’t a party 'til the gang up in it
Hit the club, light a couple Js up in it
Really in the game, you playing with it
Hold up, wait a minute
No, it ain’t a party 'til the gang up in it
Hit the club, light a couple Js up in it
Really in the game, you playing with it
Playing with it, playing with it
Really in the game, you playing with it
Hold up, wait a minute
Really in the game, you playing with it
Playing with it, playing with it
Really in the game, you playing with it
Hold up, wait a minute
Really in the game, you playing with it

[Verse 2: Chinx Drugz]
Get money every day, I could be gone tomorrow
Styling on these niggas, money piling on these niggas
A coke boy for real but ya know man
Not for the rapping but what I did over the stove man
For sure though, the bitch want to take a photo
Let me hit the weed, trick hold on
Back to the money, fuck what a hater talk
Talk back, hold back, see me skating off
Try to make it out this game
But a nigga's on fire, who gone out this flame?
Everything I try to learn I already knew
Now my name ringing bells, who the hell are you?
Shit, them niggas ain’t balling
Through the legs in the lane nigga bitch callin
Some days got a nigga counting hella figures
Haters getting too close, had to tell them niggas

[Hook]
