[Intro]
You fulled up with my [?]
I shop the [?], they got the best coke
I talk about it, I feel about it
It bout money, then we about it
I hit bank it, it's never crowded, boy
I'm just a nigga in Versace, million dollar man, ten deep [?]
All a nigga wants is a manage in a Ferrari
Shorty got that look
I'm feeling guilty catching a body
We trigger low so we got to fucking party jumpin'
This shit for the mental, I'm in [?] like I'm [?]
Different nigga,my name is Gucci Polo
They add the crib on Instagram and Photoshop
My dog just caught a case trapped [?]
Meet me on a lawyer
Luckily I stayed on the shot
Bate to kill I set the clock and generate
I be serving hallo work
I should have a dinner plate

[Hook]
You boot up with my leftovers
You boot up with my leftovers
That's old news, I'm off that
I got a new chick,got a new whip
And a valet that is parked there
You boot up with my leftovers
You boot up with my leftovers
That's old news, I'm off that
I got a new chick, got a new whip
And a valet that is parked there
You boot up for my leftovers

[Verse 2]
I'm getting sick and tired from a ping toe and a Range Rover
New shit, every day I'm on a new shit
More dogs, roughless
One condom, two chicks
Used to pose them by the bar
Now my young niggas are up
All we do is buy the bar
Sing it to my bitches like I'm busy Drake
Then she blew the candles
I might have to see the cake
Eat it how you got it and shot a real nigga's respect
Get that cookie out, don't you get it out of credit
Haters are telling me I'm freshing on your ex, nigga
And the next nigga, and the next nigga

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Young nigga turn rich,bottom line
Stash you see the cake, no covered [?]
You break leg
I'm MJ
Fuck on these hoes, will you [?]
Fuck right, will you eat that?
That's pimp shit ,we don't play that
That's your bitch
And the only way you can fuck her
If she's okay with that
[?]
That's true shit,no new shit
The same nigga before

[Hook]
