Do it for the love? (Do it for the love)
Do it for the plug? (Do it for the plug)
Tears, sweat and blood (Tears, sweat and blood)
She said "Nah, I do that for my hitta"
Would you do it just because? (My hitta)
Dozen white dove (My hitta)
Would you do this just for us?
She said "Nah, I do that for my hitta"

[Verse 1: Chinx]
Count on you to lift me up
Been with me through the mud
It's a different kind of love
Only members in the club
We even had this thing here for some years now
I guess our shit just get better with time
On this road there ain't too much you gotta fear now
We a perfect match, you my favorite kind
Valentina on your feet and both our wrists match
And you will put it on the line, I gotta hit the latch
Promise we gon' keep the trust
Like a dog you'll keep in touch
She the one who got my back ain't got no doubt in mind
Even for you never I decide you not on mine
Would you do this shit for us?
Did you tell 'em burn it up?

[Hook: Chinx]
Would you do it for the love? (Do it for the love)
Do it for the plug? (Do it for the plug)
Tears, sweat and blood (Tears, sweat and blood)
She said "Nah, I do that for my hitta"
Would you do it just because (My hitta)
Dozen white dove (My hitta)
Would you do this shit for us?
She said "Nah, I do that for my hitta"

[Verse 2: Meet Sims]
I know you love your boy, you love your nigga
You that special something, can't do nothing with you
Them other types ain't ever really fit ya
Yeah I know, you only for your nigga
Baby let me conversate you just for staying 'round
You the realest nigga out here just for staying 'round
Girl your feelings is one thing I'll never play around
Girl don't stress, [?] I promise I'm the realest nigga with you
Could it be that they're broken on me?
Could it be that there's bitches on me?
You know a nigga out here and we throwing money up
We young and reckless, waking up and [?]
Yeah, count bands, count stacks and we throw that money up
With the weed and the friend but then we roll the money up
All my niggas ever dreamed 'bout was money off the trucks
Misery at the bottom, but the only way up
