[Verse 1]
George of the jungle, lord of the bundles
Hit my youngin with the handoff, he won’t fumble
We that cocaine alumni, fresh up on the grad school
Drafted to the corner, chain might give me the motive
Verse 8, Chapter 12, Psalms 37
Evil get your [?], go and get the reverend
All them hustlers in that V, you hear the engine revving
I bet that chopper slump him over like the number seven
Who kept his own rappers out the cemetery?
Mashing on em’s number one on my itinerary
Money blocking my vision, I can't see the other side
Niggas blocking my digits, that's how motherfuckers die
Thirty thousand on that Audemar
Partying 'till the morning like I ain't got court tomorrow
Drugz, nigga, and you know that
Murder one when I'm around, lay 'em like a door mat

[Hook]
It's that murder one
Bullets hit your back, probably heard alum
Coke Boy, yeah, you heard of them
Don't talk, we be swerving on em
You don't even need a turban, get your head wrapped
You don't even need a turban, get your head wrapped
Yeah, it's that murder one, yeah, it's that murder one

[Verse 2]
I'm balling on point like a church steeple
They say you do your best business with the worst people
When you heavenly, god and none of these niggas can't reach you
I blame your OGs for what they didn't teach you
Never worry, this AK is my insurance
Hair trigger, when I tap it bullets flow like the current
Canaries on my wrist, emeralds in my chains
Y’all just little Indians, we Seminoles in the game
Shot five times ‘fore he even noticed
The fifth one hit his brain, [?] exploded
One eighty seven when we rolling
All we know is homicide, every nigga with me hold it
Killed him in Brooklyn, his family has gone bonkers
Body laid for twelve hours, the coroner was in Yonkers
My shooters put that work in, then they fade to black
Got on a vest and a ball cap, they gon’ aim for that

[Hook][x2]
