[Verse 1: Chinx]
My day 1 niggas A1
Never let the money change us
Same nigga I don't change up, nah
Couple niggas hating on me since I came up
Got it sold about 100 blocks
New jewelry set buy a hundred watches
Young rich nigga from the other side
Touch one of mine, you can duck a shot

[Verse 2: Chinx]
Just a few niggas that I'll kill for
Other niggas I don't feel for
Niggas fucking 'round with the squad
Better off running through a steel door
Banana clip blow a seal off
Talk to the driver tell him peel off
Cashed out I could take a year off
She down to take a molly in the pill form
Shorty get it on the floor
Took her on the road then she did it on the tour
From the sink then she did it on the floor
Give it to me like she did it all before
Hit your bitch with the Ray Rice
Jewelry looking funny in the daylight
Eyes open they ain't playing right
Still posted up whippin game like

[Hook: Chinx & Ty Dolla $ign]
I ain't never had no love, no love
For them niggas on the otherside, otherside
I ain't never had no love, no love
For them niggas on the otherside, otherside
I ain't never had no love, no love
For them niggas on the otherside, otherside
I ain't never had no love, no love
For them niggas on the otherside, otherside
No nigga, no nigga, no nigga, no nigga, no nigga
Fuck niggas on the other side
No nigga, no nigga, no nigga, no nigga, no nigga
Fuck niggas on the other side
No nigga, no nigga, no nigga, no nigga, no nigga
Fuck niggas on the other side
No nigga, no nigga, no nigga, no nigga, no nigga
Fuck niggas on the other side
