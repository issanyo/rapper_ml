[Intro]
La musica de Harry Fraud

[Verse 1: Bobby Shmurda]
They yellin', "Bobby put the crack down!"
A nigga makin' money off of rap now
So I had to pass the trap down
In the studio, I feel like Uncle Sam now
Mama always said I was a problem kid
Movin' work, I used to traffic where my mama live
And I even kept them ratchets at my mama crib
I had a 9, a 45 and a banana clip
Pull up on a nigga with a hundred rounds
Ain't no shootin' out the car, we gon' run him down
I told Monte, "Have him dead before the Sun is down"
Then I tell Fredricks, "Hit the club and bring a hundred out"
Bitch a hundred out
Bitch a hundred out
Bitch, money ain't a problem
Bring them gunners out, BLAOW
Bring them gunners out
Bitch money ain't a problem

[Verse 2: French Montana]
Shawty, bust it open, bend it over, how ya feel?
First they hit me up and then I got up, made a mil'
And my dogs don't swap it if that package ain't sealed
I ain’t talkin' 'bout them Beats, but my dog slangin' pills
The Pepsi and the Cola, crocs and the cobra
Artist and promoter, pull the Phantom and the boat up
Like haan

[Verse 3: Puff Daddy]
Mr. Chow's when we chow down
Bumping B.I.G. on the G5, Soundcloud
Lookie here, baby, lookie here
Money over everything, that's just how it is
Champagne everything, caviar tears
Don’t be 'fraid of this money, baby, that's just how it is

[Hook: Puff Daddy + French Montana]
Bitch, money ain't a problem
Bitch, money ain't a problem
Money ain't a problem
Bitch, money ain't a problem
I got cash, if you a bad bitch, fuck with me baby, baby
One time, one, one time
Got a bad bitch in the back seat and she ride with me
You see me shinin'!
220 on the dash, but she drivin' me crazy, crazy
One time, one, one time
Bitch, you know you gon' ride to the top if you ride with me

[Verse 4: Rowdy Rebel]
I'm ridin', I'm ridin', I'm ridin', baby
Nigga I was home sleep, that's my alibi
So I don't even know who let the hammer fly
I just know if it's problems, prolly down to ride
So keep 'em occupied, I slick 'em while your pocket's dry
When you sigh your deal, they wanna know, boy
Tell 'em that I'm GS9, Coke Boy
And tell 'em we brought guns for the smoke, boy
My nigga French still get it by the boat, boy
Say that Shmoney ain't a problem
We drop a bag on 'em, top dollars
And for a Cuban link collar
My lil' nigga Monte go and pop yah
I got shooters where you lack, I got Brooklyn on my back
I got hitters out of town, I'll send 'em where you at
For a Rollie or a stack, they'll fly him off his neck
BLAT!

[Hook: Puff Daddy + French Montana]
Money ain't a problem
I got cash, if you a bad bitch, fuck with me baby, baby
One time, one, one time
Got a bad bitch in the back seat and she ride with me
You see me shinin'!
220 on the dash, but she drivin' me crazy, crazy
One time, one, one time
Bitch, you know you gon' ride to the top if you ride with me
Yo we spendin' money and we dancin'
Let's dance, come on
Bitch, money ain't a problem
Bitch, money ain't a problem
Money ain't a problem
Bitch, money ain't a problem

[Verse 5: Chinx]
Forty auti' loaded, countin' paper, duckin' 12
Run up on you, blow it, that ain't nothin', I got bail
A nigga came up out that bottom, yeah I'm talkin' 'bout that sewer
Went and hit a lick and then I dropped that on the jeweler
Bendin' corners in that 12 and sippin' brown until I hurl up
Model bitches on me down to suck me 'til I curl up
Pussy nigga how you feel? Money on your head
I break that hundred dollar bill
Stunt right behind your will

[Hook: Puff Daddy + French Montana]
I got cash, if you a bad bitch, fuck with me baby, baby
One time, one, one time
Got a bad bitch in the back seat and she ride with me
You see me shinin'!
220 on the dash, but she drivin' me crazy, crazy
One time, one, one time
Bitch, you know you gon' ride to the top if you ride with me
Let's get this money
Bitch, money ain't a problem
Bitch, money ain't a problem
Money ain't a problem
Bitch, money ain't a problem

[Outro: Puff Daddy]
I ain't got no problems over here, baby
You be blowin' over here, baby
Can't take it with us, you know?
We gon' make the most money
And give the most money away
You feel me?
It's Bad Boy
Puff Daddy, bitch
