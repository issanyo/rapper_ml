[Hook: Chinx and Zack]
Hey fool
Bricks all in my cabinet
Getting money, we trappin'
Bandana on a MAC 10
Hey fool
What up though?
Smokin', watchin' my roof fold
Waistline where my tool go
Fake niggas, they fool's gold
Hey fool
Get shot nigga and you move around
Still serve in the school zone
Neighborhood with my jewels on
Hey fool
Shit, coolin'
Hittin' licks, movin'
Posted up with my fools
Getting high, we just foolin'
Hey fool

[Verse 1: Nipsey Hu$$le]
I'm so used to this jealousy
Stay on deck is my recipe
Can't afford no more felonies
But the hood is like Tel Aviv
Start a war and then tell on me
Type of nigga I'll never be
Suck my dick is what I tell police
And if they catch me slippin', go kill for me
Stay on track and make mills for me
Put my daughter in your will for me
Move smarter and bill for me
Don't budge an inch on them bills for me
Fuck duckin' niggas, go hunt your beef
Play offense, I don't fuck with D
If you hop out, I hop out
That's one for you, one for me
Hey fool! What up?
You heard how they came through
Yellow tape the whole block in broad day
They emptied out the whole tool
Hey fool! What?
Tell me what do you wanna go do
Pull up holdin' them bangers here
Then when he bang back it's on you like

[Verse 2: Chinx]
In the hood bums sip malt liquor out of paper bags
Why I'm skatin' in the paper tags
Every nigga you roll with, they made a glass
Around here niggas take your head off
Like a restaurant, they gon' pay the tab
And usually my breakin' point
Is when the fuck niggas start breakin' bad
Nigga counting bank, tryna find a pussy I can surf on
I don't understand, why the feds take shit so personal
If the spot ain't yours, who you work for?
13 and he ready to get to work through
Drive by, hit the deck, shots, lick, then the whip swerve off
Murders only top, neighborhood is watchin'
I pray for my sins daily cause I know the Lord is watchin'
Ain't no threat, nigga ,you playful
Been movin' work since grade school
Hey yo what the fuck this nigga just said? Huh?
