Old stupid ass bitch
You old stupid ass bitch
What you tryna curb me?
Bitch you tryna curb me?

[Verse 1: Chinx Drugz]
Pull up on a bitch, better act right
Then we whipping off in the mad white
Know a nigga tryna see what that like
We already poured about a half pint
Let me hold something fore the hoes get you
The gold digging hoes ain’t funny
Like the late great Don Bishop
Bitch better have my money
Ho, no we can’t go on no dates
I’m on the road to the bank
Blowing that loud with your skank
Dunk on these hoes in the paint
Nigga already clapped on the backboard
Give it to a ho if she ask for it
Told her she could get the dick half off
Pussy been around, need a passport
Running up the mob, can’t hear
Hoes know my niggas gone share
Broke nigga never gone fear
[?] nigga, gone steer him
Young nigga made it out the trap house
Over 100 million served
Broke bitch get on a nigga’s nerves
Hit his bum bitch with the swerve

[Verse 3: Too Short]
Tryna get that money faster, man
I know she got a master plan
A whole lotta things to get
And she want you to buy the shit
New whips is what she likes
You just tryna fuck her right
I tell you what you need to do, you need to shake the bitch and get something new
Ain't know when I'm fucking with her
I love'em, forget 'em, it's nothin', it's pimpin'
Call me when you want some dick, bitch
I can't do no trick
