[Intro]
Bands in my pocket match the car color
Yeah guess a nigga match that
I got the high score up in the gym
You know a nigga match that
Everything I do is siamese (double)
Yeah, nigga match that
I dump 100,000 on the tape (dump it)
Told 'em niggas match that

[Hook]
Match it up, match it up, up
Match it up, ma-ma-match it up
Match it up, match it up, up
Ma-ma-match it up
Can't afford 2, then you don't need one
I got your shooters too and double ones
Fuckin' round I'ma go and get a drummer sound
Brum-bum-bum-bum

[Verse 1]
Balenciaga match the coat, I had to match that
Pull up with my homie to the venue in a double matte max
Back it up, I told that bitch to come and back it up
Then she came in with her twin, tried to back me down
I call my niggas Stokes to come back me up
Did our thing and told 'em see 'em when we back in town
Hit the alley then a nigga hit the fence
Pistol D's grabbed him now they tryna match the prints
Ma-ma-match up
Nigga movin' work up out the trap
Tryna cleanse another 100,000 out the stack-stack
Stack it up
Some fishy shit ain't addin' up
She ain't the bitch that was up in my DM, shit ain't matchin' up
I put my key, you put your key in
Whole lotta paper we be seein', match that

[Hook]
Match it up, match it up, up
Match it up, ma-ma-match it up
Match it up, match it up, up
Ma-ma-match it up
Can't afford 2, then you don't need one
I got your shooters too and double ones
Fuckin' round I'ma go and get a drummer sound
Brum-bum-bum-bum

[Verse 2]
Yeah, nigga lately I've been seein' double
Fuck it, I see that money double time
I bagged this bitch, she was a pisces
Thinkin' damn, that bitch is a double sign
Yeah, two fish
After the club I pull the car out the fish spot out on 250
I told that bitch that if she like it, double tap it up
Austin laced me with the beat, I had to burn it down
I ain't have no more room in the car
But if she thirsty and she still wanna roll that, lap it up
I've let a nigga double park
Niggas cursin' at me cause I'm backin' all the traffic up
I saw a bitch, don't give me head like my main do
So I had to cut her off cause she couldn't match that

[Hook]
Match it up, match it up, up
Match it up, ma-ma-match it up
Match it up, match it up, up
Ma-ma-match it up
Can't afford 2, then you don't need one
I got your shooters too and double ones
Fuckin' round I'ma go and get a drummer sound
Brum-bum-bum-bum
