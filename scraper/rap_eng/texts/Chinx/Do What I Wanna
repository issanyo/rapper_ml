[Hook: Zack and Chinx Drugs]
Do it when I wanna, I do it when I wanna
Do it when I wanna, spend that money clean baby
Do it when I wanna
Bitch I do what I wanna (Doin what I wanna)
Do what I wanna (Doin what I wanna)
Bitch I do what I wanna (Doin what I wanna)
Do what I wanna (I'm doin what I wanna)
Bitch I do what I wanna (I do it when I wanna) (x8)

[Verse 1: Chinx Drugz]
I'll do it when I wanna, I do my dirt up by my lonely
Doin' shit my own way, she ain't fuckin' told her gon head
Bossed up no lie, get tossed up don't try
Get barkin' up that wrong tree
Them shoes ain't your size
Leave with your bitch in Atlanta
We gon' keep getting these bands
Before you gon cuff, I'm just gon tell you, I hit your bitch in advance
Boy he be servin like Venus
Ballin' like Gilbert Arenas
Fresh out them jacks, right on that corner
Now we be packing arenas
Driven in all of this gold
Then if I do it I don't
Don't even mention, nigga I guess it
Bitch I'm gon do what I (x2)

[Verse 2: Chinx Drugz]
Your main bitch, she chosing sides
You po-pimping, do or die
I'm cramped up in that two seater, not one bitch
But two inside
One shell fits on cap sizes
For them M's you stack thousands
They startin' off on that bullshit
The ma-heat close, (?)
Like I did a nigga on the brick
Do what I want, free as a bird
Shout with niggas locked behind a wall in a fence
Pussy ass judge got the nerve
When the coke boy drop make the floor shake
Niggas hate but they girls twats pulsate
Hopping out the roof with the lv button
Pussy ass niggas can't tell me nothing!
Ain't worried about none of these niggas I do what I want (x4)
