[Intro: Eric Bellinger]
This gon' be your favorite song

[Pre-Hook: Mally Mall]
Are we fucking or what?
Maybach back seat, up in the cut
Are we fucking or what?
Maybach back seat, up in the cut

[Hook: Eric Bellinger]
I can tell you're a freak
Let me get it from the back now, don't hold up
I can tell you're a freak
Don't play with a real nigga that wanna hit it now
I got a hundred bands on me
So baby tell me, tell me what it's gonna be
They say money don't grow on trees
But Mally Mall in this bitch with me
I can tell you're a freak

[Verse 1: Too $hort]
I go on and on
Feelin' good can't do no wrong
I've been doin' this so long
Raise your hands if it's your song
I wanna fuck you and your friend
It's not a one night stand if we do it again
Lil' bad bitch from California
Saw me in the whip when I bent that corner
Now watch a real pimp mack on her
I coulda knocked you in the lone
Don't wanna talk, go for dinner, I don't wanna wait
I wanna fuck, I don't wanna go on a date

[Hook: Eric Bellinger]
I can tell you're a freak
Let me get it from the back now, don't hold up
I can tell you're a freak
Don't play with a real nigga that wanna hit it now
I got a hundred bands on me
So baby tell me, tell me what it's gonna be
They say money don't grow on trees
But Mally Mall in this bitch with me
I can tell you're a freak

[Verse 2: Eric Bellinger]
All I got is you up on my mind, yeah
And I think it's time for us to bump and grind, girl
I know you are ready, I see it in your eyes, yeah
But you gotta be the type to ride or die

[Bridge: Mally Mall]
Are we fucking or what?
Maybach back seat, up in the cut
Slide to the back when she come in front
Face on [?] with a big O butt
Last Kings killing, we know how it's done
[?]
VVS1, that's the cut
Baby girl [?]

[Hook: Eric Bellinger]
I can tell you're a freak
Let me get it from the back now, don't hold up
I can tell you're a freak
Don't play with a real nigga that wanna hit it now
I got a hundred bands on me
So baby tell me, tell me what it's gonna be
They say money don't grow on trees
But Mally Mall in this bitch with me
I can tell you're a freak

[Verse 3: Chinx Drugz]
Why would the wrong whores do the right things?
She regular up on the night scene
Cute face, limp ways with the tight jeans
'Member back when she used to have a tight thing?
That's why [?] outdoors
Never miss a [?] in all our tours
And you the same silly nigga tryna claim it, [?]
I can tell you a freak, hoe
Got a nigga brick like I missed free throw
Caught a bitch [?] Philly, then I hit it from the back
Had her yell out "Free Meek", though

[Hook: Eric Bellinger]
I can tell you're a freak
Let me get it from the back now, don't hold up
I can tell you're a freak
Don't play with a real nigga that wanna hit it now
I got a hundred bands on me
So baby tell me, tell me what it's gonna be
They say money don't grow on trees
But Mally Mall in this bitch with me
I can tell you're a freak

[Outro: Mally Mall and Eric Bellinger]
Are we fucking or what?
Maybach back seat, up in the cut
I can tell you're a freak
(Are we fucking or what? Are we fucking or what, baby?)
I can tell you're a freak
Are we fucking or what?
Maybach back seat, up in the cut
I can tell you're a freak
(Are we fucking or what? Are we fucking or what, baby?)
I can tell you're a freak
(Are we fucking or what? Are we fucking or what?
Are we fucking or what? Are we fucking or what?
Tell me daddy
Are we fucking or what? Yeah
Are we fucking or what? Are we fucking or what?
Tell me daddy)
