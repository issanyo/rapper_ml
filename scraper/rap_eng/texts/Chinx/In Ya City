[Intro: Chinx Drugz]
All this paper got my feelings numb
Came to the realization they ain't..
All this paper got my feelings numb
Came to the realization they ain't..

[Verse 1: Chinx Drugz]
All this paper got my feelings numb
Came to the realization they ain't real as us
Crack slinger turned composer, found that pot of gold
Praying for a smoother ride on that rocky road
Every gram off that lobby sold
Slap your bitch like the puck, talk it hockey go
They want the shine but can't foot the labor
Foreign ride my garage it's for ripping stable
Went from bagging up the work, loading magazines
To looking down at the game from the mezzanine
We them niggas in your city ho
From the blocks to the screens on your vizio

[Hook]
(Know the niggas in the city)
Oh ye we found a way
And we started from the back
And now we're miles away
(Know the niggas in the city)
I did it my way
And like I'm dreaming but I'm on my way
(Know the niggas in the city)
And we done put all this work
(Know the niggas in the city)

[Verse 2: Chinx Drugz]
Witness vision of a nigga who envision much
Seize your moments cause you only get to live it once
Closer to God told my ceiling one
Told my niggas before you feast just know the meal you want
All these Jesus pieces you think it's a holy war
Renovated the crib, I'm freakin'a hold the chord (?)
Got these niggas bowing like they making prayer
I occupy the seat up in that vacant chair
Coke boys run the game that's me on out
Fuck niggas hate it go on pull your hair on out
In them hills choppin up with Diddy
I thought I told you..

[Hook]
