I'm the biggest rapper in my city no stories
I swear a broke bitch can't do shit for me
But if she got the whole world in her pants
Then it's boy meets world call me Corey
We up in this bitch tell a hater get ghost
Burning through the bread like I'm trying to make toast
Baby I'm a player most players can't coach
So it's first class flights cause I'm not a good coach
Living in the burbs let me in the hood though
Burn rubber I be gassing call me Suzy sideshow
Riding with my main thang on some low key shit
G shit, if she ain't with the move then it's peace then
Beasting, always gotta keep something decent on me
Never lonely, always riding with the homies
And what you mean fool it's turn up time?
You ain't fucking with the gang don't come outside
I said
This is for the hot girls
Go ahead, heat it up don't stop girl (what)
This is for the hot girls
Go ahead, heat it up don't stop girl (what)
Make it hot, don't stop girl
Make it hot, don't stop girl
Make it hot, don't stop girl
Make it hot, don't stop girl
Coke boys do our own thing
Rakim Eric B with rope chains
In them game niggas from the sidelines
Let the niggas lease I'ma buy mine
It ain't how you fall it's how you bounce back
Shorty bending over god bounce back
Fuck boys coming for my head huh
Caked up way before the deal huh
Got a main bitch, hundred side hoes
Flying down hate ducking pot holes
Pimping like nigga from Oakland
Getting blood money with the niggas that be locing
This is for the hot girls
Go ahead, heat it up don't stop girl (what)
This is for the hot girls
Go ahead, heat it up don't stop girl (what)
Make it hot, don't stop girl
Make it hot, don't stop girl
Make it hot, don't stop girl
Make it hot, don't stop girl
If you fucking with a nigga let me hold some
But when I'm done you gotta put your clothes on
Ain't trying to lead a ho they trying to prolong
Told that ho to burn it up get your roll on (burn it up)
Jumping on these hoes from the foul line
Taking off like a rocket money Yao high
All my niggas grubbing when it's chow time
All this purple and these pills I'm on cloud 9
She be shaking like a crap table
She be doing numbers like a calculator
Said she only want a dope dealer
Then I guess she want the boys with the coke nigga
This is for the hot girls
Go ahead, heat it up don't stop girl (what)
This is for the hot girls
Go ahead, heat it up don't stop girl (what)
Make it hot, don't stop girl
Make it hot, don't stop girl
Make it hot, don't stop girl
Make it hot, don't stop girl
