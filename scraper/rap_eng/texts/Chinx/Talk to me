[Chinx Drugz Verse One]
We start off on good note but then you draw blank
You never put me on on what side you meant to bank
We had a few good runs but then you changed on me
The truth is I'm tired of you switching the game on me
But overall you know I want you close
See you never leave me completely, and that's the shit I love the most
Am I a sucka? Cause I know other niggas fuck ya
Then I let you back in the crib it just leaves me to wonder
Do I really need you, or am I insecure
Because the thought of you breezing it draws me to you more
You a selfish whore, but I love sluts
I'm constantly scheming to get you think I'm going nuts
I'm looking for some closure, can you fill me in?
Every time I think I'm getting close you leave me in the wind
I'm lost in my grind, racing against the time
When you think you're ready we can ? anytime

[Chorus]
Talk to me
Let me know what's on your mind I ain't got nothing but time
Speak to me
Tell me everything you're going through, it'll only take a moment to
Talk to me
Let me know what's on your mind I ain't got nothing but time
Speak to me
Tell me everything you're going through, this conversations overdue

[Chinx Drugz Verse 2]
Yellow coupe top down rolling through the slums
Time is money so I'm only moving for the ones
Take control of me, every step I take it's like you holding me
I feel ashamed but baby don't let go of me
A lost soul left with no direction
I type you in my GPS but the system won't give me no directions
You give a little then you take it back
When I express myself in the bed you just roll over and take a nap
If that ain't cold hearted, then I don't know what is
But I done built up a tolerance for it over years
Why don't you stay with me forever?
And am I wasting my time with all of this effort
You the only thing thats precious, even though you lead me on
Will you ever love me back can you let it be known
Until the verdict is announce you the air I'm taking in and pushing out
I breathe you

[Chorus]
Talk to me
Let me know what's on your mind I ain't got nothing but time
Speak to me
Tell me everything you're going through, it'll only take a moment to
Talk to me
Let me know what's on your mind I ain't got nothing but time
Speak to me
Tell me everything you're going through, this conversations overdue
