[Verse 1: Chinx]
Keys, valet, got the whip outside
Shawty knows she fucking with a boss
Throwing back shots of the Henn all night
And she down to break a nigga off
She ain’t never rolled with a nigga like this
That be for certain, that’s one thing I know
Count up this money, yeah we get the dough
Pull up the foreign and she revved to go
99 problems but the money never was it
I done switched the same money over three times
She ain’t fucking with you ‘cause she really want to roll
With a rich young nigga from the east side
You ain’t gotta count it, see the money all there
Fuck them niggas hating, they ain’t going nowhere
Seven days a week, 365
We the only niggas in the club throwing money all year

[Verse 2: MeetSims]
Pouring outside
Raindrops got the foreign outside
Looking like it need a [?], nah-nah-nah-nah-nah-nah
Hundreds in the rubber band, stacked on the table
When you throw ‘em make the stripper bitches go nah-nah-nah-nah-nah-nah
Pussy poppin’, make the pussy roll
Matter fact do it for my bros
When it come to money we the only niggas spending
Guess why niggas always got they face nah-nah-nah-nah-nah-nah
Alright now, ok now
We the only niggas in the club throwing money
Poppin’ bub, getting stripper bitches paid now
Alright now, ok now
We the only niggas in the club throwing money
Poppin’ bub, getting stripper bitches paid now
