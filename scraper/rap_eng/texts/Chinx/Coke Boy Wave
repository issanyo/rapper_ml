[Hook: Lady]
Just another day livin' in the hood
Just another day around the way
I'm still on my coke boy wave
I duck the D's and I'm here to stay
[X2]

[Verse 1: Chinx Drugz]
New keys to that 7-room fortress
My real-estate broker sent the fax from his office
The game I'm givin' out's worth a fortune
Remember we ain't have a drop of clean water in the faucet
Now it's 7's in the front lawn
Game we gon' bogard
Eli to Packs tell my block runners go long
Gettin' straight to that money I don't prolong
All this frozen water on me nigga need a coat on
The haters talkin' bout me I don't hear a peep
With just a little bit of faith ima take a leap
Fresh fitted home game Yankee Stadium
Bullets like stylists they'll decorate your cranium

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Chinx Drugz]
Clear the runway, spread my wings then I take off
Light a kush blunt, take a sip, shake the hate off
Couple bad bitches poolside
You never see them pictures through a fools eyes
I'm aiming for the top nigga bulls-eye
McLaren fishtailin' on Rodeo Drive
Boss shit put yo money on it
Gotta grease the wheels just to keep the money rollin'
Coke boys run New York, got my tracksuit on
I'm everything you was, tell his ass move on
With them lame niggas talk is rubbish
I move my fam to the suburb but its

[Hook]
