[intro]
I swear I want this to last us a lifetime
Those are times we most ain't in out right mind
High on prescription pills
So  much I miss the feeling
If I could just play this shit off
If I could just play this shit off
If I could feel you (feeling)
All I need is one evening (feeling)
If I could feel you (up)
All I need is one evening (up)
Oh, they throw me out of them  heavens I promise I'll fall on that bed
If you don't mean me no harm nigga promise that I will not wait..
No more
No more
Out in the know
Is this time for real
Is this time for real
This Time
Ahhh
Ohhh
Ahhh
I need to know which Way I left the door
Came without nothing
No package, no luggage, no doe
If I can be the one
Ohhh
If I can be the one
I need to know
Is this time for real
This time

I swear I want this to last us a lifetime
Those are times we most ain't in out right mind
High on prescription pills
So  much I miss the feeling
If I could just play this shit off
If I could just play this shit off
Lord knows

They throw me out of them heavens I promise ill fall on that bed
If you don't mean me no harm nigga promise that I will not wait..
No more
No more
Out in the know
Is this time for real
Is this time for real
This Time
Ahhha
Ohhh
I need to know which way I'm left to go
Came without nothing
No package, no luggage, no dough
If I can be the one
Ohhh
If I can be the one
I swear I want this to last us a lifetime
Those are times we most ain't in out right mind
How on prescription pills
So  much I miss the feeling
If I could just play this shit off
If I could just play this shit off

Lord knows
