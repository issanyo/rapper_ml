[Hook]
Walked in this bitch and tossed a hundred bands up
I just blew a check
Nigga talking money but they never saying nothing
Young nigga laughing to the bank
She ain’t tryna fuck, tell her holler then
They ain’t bout a buck, told em holler then
Never talking much, tell em holler then
Feet up on the clutch, tell em holler then

[Verse 1]
Both hands, my Vs up, ain’t talking bout Virginia [?]
Wide body, they freeze up, slide with something slender nigga
Drink when I want, smoke when I want
If you stick to the script, how you change up the story
Alligator my watch, call it crocodile dungeon
Your bitch stay on the jock, like the hand of Al Bundy
Nigga dripping in water, neck's all frigid
VH1, E channel, know you see us on TV
From the bleachers they watching, Porsche Julio Chavez
Shawty hit the club, tell the DJ go and play my shit
From the bleachers they watching, Porsche Julio Chavez
Shawty hit the club, tell the DJ go and play my shit

[Hook]
Walked in this bitch and tossed 100 bands up
I just blew a check
Nigga talking money but they never saying nothing
Young nigga laughing to the bank
She ain’t tryna fuck, tell her holler then
They ain’t bout a buck, told em holler then
Never talking much, tell em holler then
Feet up on the clutch, tell em holler then

[Verse 2]
Hate to fall from this height, bounce back
Take a selfie in the mirror and shawty make it bounce back
Versace on my face cause the coupe from [?] space
And this bitch is all white like heaven, open up the gates
So before you drop it boil in the water like the eye
Got a main bitch and another on the side
Four car garage, which one I'll decide
Fuck up out my dope house, hurry up and buy
Nigga think it’s 7:30, we be 7:45
Young nigga spending money we gone blow it every time
Nigga think it’s 7:30, we be 7:45
Young nigga spending money we gone blow it every time

[Hook]
Walked in this bitch and tossed 100 bands up
I just blew a check
Nigga talking money but they never saying nothing
Young nigga laughing to the bank
She ain’t tryna fuck, tell her holler then
They ain’t bout a buck, told em holler then
Never talking much, tell em holler then
Feet up on the clutch, tell em holler then
