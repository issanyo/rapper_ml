Yeah!!!
Right!!!
It's all I know

(Hook)
Talking bout the money, talking bout the money
Talking bout the hoes, talking bout the hoes
Talking bout the cars (the cars)
That street shit is all I know, it's all I know
It's all I know, it's all I know, it's all I know, its all I know
Nigga if you scared go and buy yourself a gun or call 5-0
It's all I know, it's all I know, it's all I know, its all I know
Nigga if you scared go and buy yourself a gun or call 5-0

(Verse 1)
Drew the perfect portrait now I'm hanging up the picture
Bought myself a fortress isolated from them niggas
Drinking out the faucet thats equated with the riches
Curve ya niggas but do anything for the bitches
Came from the bottom sewer
Ballin' like Dumars back when he played for the Pistons
Hit the gun range, practice aiming at a witness
Song singing need 'em at arraignment with the biscuit
Coke boy ex dope boy
If you ya brother's keeper nigga watch him die doughboy
Boyz in the hood still drinking juice
Thots in the hood still getting loose

(Hook)

(Verse 2)

Everything that happened in these streets god planned em
You know I'm close cuz you can feel the heat start fanning
Snatch the soul out your punk ass make you touch grass
Put a hole in em big enough you can park a van in
Came up swapped the sardines for the salmon
See it's funny how real brick layers turn to scammers
Still watching cameras trafficking the balance
Air your dirty laundry keep your eyes on your hammer

(Hook)
