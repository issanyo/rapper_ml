[Verse 1]
Made my way about that lobby
Now I’m a walking lick come rob me
Paid attention to my O.G
So I end up no homi (homicide)
I’m on solid ground with my ten toes
Haters frown when that Benz rolls
But watch what you say cause
That forty hotter than ten stoves
Get burn, Dead presidents i earned
Now my money straight like worms
Niggas went left but I made the right turn
Before you get left, better say the right words
Word! Niggas done came out the jects
Fuck what they talking if ain't ’bout them checks
Ten white bricks rolling in the white Vette
Fly young nigga fuck whoever I got next, yeah

[Hook]
Twenty bricks in the trunk I'm going
Just got pulled over and I'm on parole
The only option I got is blow it
If they catch me high I ain't ever coming home
Nigga there's no way out, there's no way out, (nigga there's no way out)
X9

[Verse 2]
Now them hatin' niggas want to kill me
And them bad bitches want to fuck me
If you owed a nigga, I want mine
You say a nigga tryin’ to duck me
I’ll be riding round with my young nigga
Fuck niggas we don't run with em
My dough stack like ten-five
So it's five racks by ten times
I pull up and stunt on them hoes
You see me drippin', all covered in gold
Used to hit licks on them corners, was cold
Drop that work, let it boil on the stove
Might get shot caught dipping in the projects
Young nigga balling, I’m dripping in them rocks
Bricks in the trucks ride around, nigga hot
Just got both and I bail on the cops

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Look, came in this bitch on my own
No supervision look bitch now I’m grown
They want me dead but I came out that hole
Glock 40, lets see how many shells it can hold
Roll through the blocks tell em' niggas duck
Point of a brick tryin’ get a buck
When your nigga with you trying live it up
Because when the feds come and get him, better wish him luck
Chasing that money I feel like I’m trapped
When I be open I lay with that strap
For the right number they aim at your cap
Only one way in and out of the trap
Feeling like Pac get a nigga up
Safe half way, trying to fill it up
Dees on the block trying to get a bust
Will I still get the keys to the bigger truck?

[Hook]
