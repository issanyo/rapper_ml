[Hook]
All the drugs that I did
All this money I blew
All the planes that I flew
When you with the dream team
How the hell can I lose
I dun seen the bottom and top at the same time
Talking bout a whole lot of spinach
Get the dough and your ho she get curved Roger Clemens
Talking O's I'm supposed to get the dough by the minute boy

[Verse 1]
And your bitch a liar, and your bitch a liar, and your bitch a liar
She dun sucked me off and kissed you then she looked you in your eyes
Said she'd never leave you
Type of shit that she do
I be rolling up this dank
Shaking off this evil
Stack so much they call me Jewish
My money talking Hebrew
Super dark tints on my ride
Black shades when I roll out
Bundle up because for sure you know it gets cold out

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
That's just how we on it, that's just how we on it
Super fly grain gripper scooping hoes
How you gain the world then you lose your soul?
Coke Boys run the game
Let the truth be told
I'm elevated, so elevated
Boy I'm hella faded
I dun rose up for the paper
Then rose to the occasion
Talking Ros√© by the cases
Boy look at their faces
Listen up ho this that real, who dun left the fakers
See that pussy was a steal, it was for the taking
Bank stop when we shaking
4-5-6 on that rollout
One push of that button and my whole roof is gon fall out
Harry blowing indo back to back hits till we zone out
Boy we packing venues and when we here show get sold out
I was on top of the paper you was on top of them hoes
Now it's fuck you niggas pay me I dun come up out of that hole, boy
