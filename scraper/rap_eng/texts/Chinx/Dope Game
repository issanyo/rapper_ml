[Intro: Takbar]
Yeah, you know
Niggas prolly shoulda been taking this rap more serious
But when you gettin' money in the streets forreal
It's kinda hard to stop and go to the booth, you know
When that paper steadily callin' you all day
You get sidetracked from this shit, ya know what I'm sayin'
And only real niggas that was gettin' real money in these streets Gon' understand what I'm sayin', you know
A lot of times these rappers, they just be talkin' shit they see
They emulatin' life, street life
A lot of these motherfuckers ain't never got no cash
So they had plenty of time to be in the stu
You know, sleepin' in and all that shit
But nigga, we was really rippin' and runnin'
Gettin' this motherfuckin' money
And it's prolly my callin'
I shoulda been did this shit a long time ago
But I was gettin' to that paper
Please don't judge me, shit
I'ma D-Boy so you know all the hoes gon' love me
10 toes down, not one less
And everyday I wake up nigga I'ma ball n' flex (ballin')

[Hook: Chinx Drugz and Tak]
I would've been here sooner
I would've been here sooner
But I was caught up in the hoes
Caught up in the cars
Caught up in the money
Caught up in the life
I would've been here sooner
But I got caught up in the dope game
Talking bout this money made me feel
I got caught up in the dope game
A certain type of way, certain type of way
I got caught up in the dope game
Sorry for the wait
I got caught up in the dope game
I got caught up in the dope game

[Verse 1]
Better late than never, perfect timing for the money
Watchin' niggas ball I swear to god it made me hungry
Blowin' California just a product of the corner
Talkin' out of turn I had them niggas run up on you
Whip to chill a nigga broke his wrist and bought a foreign
Niggas kill you for this lifestyle if they can't afford it
Bank 12 stories
Drop top shorty
Cock Glock 40'
Hit the court and drop 40
It's hot up in the kitchen turn the fan up
Quick to sit and when you piss, a nigga stand up
Nigga quit the bitchin', nigga stand up
Retaliations when them niggas hit your man up
Young niggas aiming at your head for them dollas
Nigga talk trash, find his head in the garbage
We ain't gotta kill him, he was dead on arrival
Nigga paranoid, man I swear I'm getting followed

[Hook: Chinx Drugz and Tak]
I would've been here sooner
I would've been here sooner
But I was caught up in the hoes
Caught up in the cars
Caught up in the money
Caught up in the life
I would've been here sooner
But I got caught up in the dope game
Talking bout this money made me feel
I got caught up in the dope game
A certain type of way, certain type of way
I got caught up in the dope game
Sorry for the wait
I got caught up in the dope game
Sorry for the wait, sorry, what

[Verse 2]
Bendin' corners, ridin' on them niggas no insurance
Feds rush the kitchen, throw the chickens down the toilet
Fuck them niggas talkin', straight to business I was on it
Dope flow fiends, tell you Christmas every morning
Nigga back when I got pinched I prayed I'd bail out
Now I sit on red guts, pushin' to the red line
Straight to bucket on them niggas talkin' cleared out
Hated holidays cause the pens hand your mail out
It's hot up in the kitchen turn the fan up
Lights flash when them niggas pull the van up
Told my niggas go and get it fuck you scared of?
For you be a man down, keep your head up
All you niggas told me use a green light
'Member nigga used to move the work for the clean right
Nigga drop his top they be aimin' at your bean like
Youngin' was a church nigga, now he throwing B's like

[Hook: Chinx Drugz and Tak]
I would've been here sooner
I would've been here sooner
But I was caught up in the hoes
Caught up in the cars
Caught up in the money
Caught up in the life
I would've been here sooner
But I got caught up in the dope game
Talking bout this money made me feel
I got caught up in the dope game
A certain type of way, certain type of way
I got caught up in the dope game
Sorry for the wait
I got caught up in the dope game
Sorry for the wait
I got caught up in the dope game
