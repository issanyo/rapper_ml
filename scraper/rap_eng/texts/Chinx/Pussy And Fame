Intro : all this money falling in my lap

[Hook: Chinx Drugz]

I'm talkin' pussy and this fame. I'm talkin' pussy and this fame
I'm talkin' pussy and this fame, this pussy and this fame
Got me, pussy and this fame. I'm talkin' pussy and this fame
I'm talkin' pussy and this fame, I'm talkin' pussy and this fame
Got me, pussy and this fame. I'm talkin' pussy and this fame
I'm talkin' pussy and this fame. I'm talkin' pussy and this fame
Got me, pussy and this fame. I'm talkin' pussy and this fame
I'm talkin' pussy and this fame. I'm talkin' pussy and this fame, fuckin' up my brain

[Verse 1: Chinx Drugz]

My old bitch is your ol' lady, slim but my gun 480
You fuck wit' us, you gon' need the Air Force and four Navies
I'm in the game and they nose bleeds. 24 with no sleep
I left the club with your freak. I tossed the dick, she goin' deep
There's pussy on my brain, pussy in my lap
I treat pussy like it's beef, you know a nigga stay strapped
Ratchet pussy, I tap the pussy. Beat it up, then get back to pussy
Man this shit is so real. I should kill all y'all niggas
Call me O'Neal. Hottest nigga, no deal
Heard they talking four mill. Two bitches on pills
Two cribs, two cars. Man this shit is for real

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Yo Gotti]

Lifestyle of the poor and thuggin'
Seen a brother rob a brother, cousin rob a cousin
Yeah, pussy niggas fall in love with pussy
Not me my nigga, I keep it pushin'
Y-y-you a lame nigga, you should get no pussy
Y-y-you a lame nigga, you shoudn't have no pistol
Y-y-you the famous brokest nigga I ever seen with your dope boy costume, Halloween
Fuck the fame, bitch I'm on the winning team
All my bitches got that wet wet, swimming team
They say what goes around, comes around. I smell pussy and ain't no hoes around
That means one of these fucks niggas a clown...pussy
You swimming with them sharks, know you gon' drown...pussy
I ain't famous, bitch I'm thuggin'. And I ain't trippin', bitch I love it
