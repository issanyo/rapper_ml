La MÃºsica de Harry Fraud

(Chinx Drugz: Love me so good since she love me so ??)

[Verse 1: Chinx Drugz]
I'm talking guala on the cruiser
Guala on the penthouse
They know I be movin'
Shawty, on my, shawty on my
Line I'm finna scoop her, you know I'm finna cold crush
Find a gang iller, ain't no such pole, nigga
Rose sipper, hoes won't diss ya
Rose dipper, pose when them fans want pictures
They clockin' my ensemble, critiquing in my convo
Never let them see me sweat, ho it ain't a problem
Tell them niggas lay down, fucking with the g's
But the zone's how we play now, we gonna hit the skis
Top dog, pup stay down, plucking off the fleas
When that drop hit that block, dip it clock, dip it ??
Bet yo main bitch gon' hit her knees
And we was on some speed
And we was on some pills
And she was on some weed
And she knows I was on it
Early in the mornin'
Back after my paper
Like I was never zonin'
It's Chinx Drugz, peace flooded flows off richter
Got their hands out, man them hoes gonna get you
When that money gone, none of hoes go with you
Them niggas watered down but they know that my sound
Orchestrates a perfect picture

(Action Bronson)
Bronson
It's the one hitta quitta man
Bam Bam
I'll be there, give me 5 minutes

(Evil Empire drop)

[Verse 2: Action Bronson]
Broken mirrors in the crib cause I'm sick
Put a fucking camera in the toilet on some shit
Got a bunch of manicured paper in the box in the closet
Dollars over bitches, I'm only using logic
Rubber bands break, fly the plane
Another landscape, can tell you're pussy by your handshake
Clammy color of the Porsche Banane
Off your granny, catch me out in North Miami
With two dikes that play ball for the Sparks
All these little guppies try swimming with the sharks
I'm known for swimming, rocking linen in the dark
360s in the Beamer where we're chilling in the park
Uh, she boof so much, she don't even fuck
But her body looking good in that leotard
She said "Bronson, I love you 'till I die"
Baby like Robocop, gun inside the thigh
It's me
