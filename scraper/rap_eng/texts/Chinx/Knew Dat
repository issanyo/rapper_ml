[Intro: Chinx Drugz]
Nigga we share that bitch
I thought you knew that
Our whips ain't the same nigga
I thought you knew dat

[Hook: Chinx Drugz]
Fuck if they love me or hate me, I thought you knew dat
Top of that brand new mercedes, I thought you knew dat
Rather be rich than be famous, I thought you kew dat
I left the club with your lady
I thought you knew dat (I thought you knew dat) (x9)

[Verse 1: Chinx Drugz]
Came in here smelling like money
Most love the scent of my cologne
Shoot a niggas head at the guard
Had to shoot him twice in the dome
Sweet under age pussy like an offer
You know I leave the lil bitch lost
Niggas said they fucking with the coke boy
Go on put the nigga on the phone
G5 Flex I done flew that
Broke nigga ask how you do that
Who done let u fuck niggas in
Looking at the niggas like who dat?
Banging wit some niggas screaming Eastside
They gon tell a nigga never who dat?
I be acting weird for the money
Nigga where the fuck you at?
Nigga we run New York City, I thought you knew dat
I woke up feeling like Diddy, I thought you knew dat
We gon ball out till infinite, I thought you knew dat
Send shells at fuck niggas snitching, i done been through dat

[Hook: Chinx Drugz]

[Verse 2: Cap-1]
A bitch ain't the same, I thought you knew dat
My plug just gave a hundred pounds of some birds
I’m runnin' through that
My Hittas don’t play ‘bout that action
They stomp a nigga whip him blue -black
I walk in the club I got 50k and pistols all in my book bag
MCM gang, Move Coke Major
My shoe cost a bear, nothing but favour
My whip was a hundred thou
Just to piss off the neighbours
I'm fucking up the extra middle finger to the hataz
Spend thirty thousand on the Rollie, I thought you knew that
These Cuban Links not from Cuba, but thats where my boo at
These bitches looking for that molly water, where the food at?
And these pussy niggas got their eyes closed, what they shoot at?
