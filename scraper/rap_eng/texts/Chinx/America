Happy hour, fried on a Friday
Getting to the money in the worst way
All black ski mask, nigga fuck
You ain’t want it that bad in the first place
I fell in love with the money
Straight you can’t take that shit from me
Twentys and fiftys and hundreds
Money and power, I want it, I want it, only in America
Only in America, only in America, only in America
We came to fuck up the money, we came to fuck up the money
We came to fuck up the money, money and power, I want it, I want it
Only in America

[Verse 1: Chinx]
Shawn Kemp nigga, 40 on the chest
On the strip, drop forty on a stretch
Young nigga from the East Side
Dibs on your bitch and my homie got next
Young nigga whip the soda, talking full time watching for the Rovers
On the stove top, tryna whip a bonus
Tryna clock mine early in the morning
I be getting to the bank, with a half a quarter in the tank
Count it then we throw it in the bank
Nigga just flew back into the states
Never gave a fuck of what another nigga think
Nigga we gone still throw the pills in the drink
Love about the deal, I got the wheels on the skate
Pussy niggas still getting killed on the tape
Foot up on the gas, nigga getting to the bank
All black mask nigga, what’s up in the safe?
Drop a little bag, they gone figure where you stay
Turn into a problem, we gone get them out the way
We came to fuck up the money, we came to fuck up the money
Twenties and Fifties and Hundreds
Money and power, I want it, I want it, I want it

Young nigga whipping in the kitchen
Put it on the table, we gone cook it up for dinner
See a nigga shining, bitch you fucking with a winner
Bitch cop [?] to emasculate with us
Real niggas shoot every day
All gold chains, [?] the pay
Politicking paper, tryna make it in the office
Fucking with them laws, you gone end up in a coffin
Anything else when it comes to this paper, you know
Green light your spot for the ticket, please enjoy the show
All of my niggas gone come up
Fuck up the blunt, make it double
I fell in love with the coco, fuck with the dope that’s a nono
I ain’t gone lie, niggas paying double for the fishscale pie
Early morning whipping so the powder wouldn’t fry
Bring it to her bubble and another poured 5
Jumping out the jungle, we just tryna stay alive
Never been a killer but don’t try me nigga
Ain’t nobody scared to catch a body nigga
Got a couple niggas riding with me, now they’ll rob you
You might fuck around a be the nigga that we body
