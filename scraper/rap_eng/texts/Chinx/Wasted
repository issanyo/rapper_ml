Evil Empire

[Intro]
If lovin' you is wrong, I don't wanna be right
If being right means being without you
I'd rather live our own good life
Your momma and daddy say it's a shame
It's a down right disgrace
As long as I gotchu by my side
I don't care what them people say

[Hook: French Montana]
Uhh
I grind I ain't feelin' to sleep shawty
I grind I ain't feelin' to sleep
I grind I ain't feelin' to sleep
Shawty should fuck him good so he could sleep well
I'm wasted
(Evil Empire)
I grind I ain't feelin' to sleep
Shawty grind oughta put me to sleep
I'm wasted
I'm tryna hold on to
Baby you could stay
You waited
You’ve got me armed like a Rottweiler
Rollin' purp, poppin' bottles, wasted
I put my all into it, do it every day
Sweet lady

[Verse 1: Chinx Drugz]
It's hard workin' over everything I ain't changed
Most of these niggas wit' me on the same page
You ain't my kinfolk we ain't on the same page
You ain't hit the block wit' me till the day came
Started this in '01, got knocked '05
Came home blew up
You know we got the city locked
Coke boys certified gettin' it
That rap money slow up, then I hit the pots whippin'
Cuz niggas never love you 'til you dead and gone
Never know how much you love it 'til you let it go
I grind hard put in overtime
On my A game, each and every time

[Hook: French Montana]
I grind I ain't feelin' to sleep
Shawty should fuck him good so he could sleep well
I'm wasted
I'm tryna hold on to
Baby you could stay
You waited
You’ve got me armed like a Rottweiler
Rollin' purp, poppin' bottles, wasted
I put my all into it, do it every day
Sweet lady

[Verse 2: French Montana]
Stars in a movie
Want the 4 door but the dealer tryna coupe me
I'm tryna play the part, pop bottles gettin' smacked
Shawty fuck a room we can do it in the back
Cloggin' up the window lookin' for the police
Nigga hot as fish grease mobbin' through the cold streets
Talkin' town after town after town I ain't tryna wait
You know my shit dumpin' like the 808
Wakeup bread breakup steady ridin'
See it in my face can't hide it
You know my money dirty but my face clean
Steady ridin' like the A train
Time I ain't wastin

[Hook: French Montana]
I grind I ain't feelin' to sleep
Shawty grind oughta put me to sleep
I'm wasted
I'm tryna hold on to
Baby you could stay
You waited
You've got me ??? like a Rottweiler
Rollin' purp, poppin' bottles, wasted
I put my all into it, do it every day
Sweet lady
