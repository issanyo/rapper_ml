[Intro]
I just want to know
I just want to know

[Hook – Chinx]
Do you finance cars or do you lease em
I just want to know
Is that you coming out the freezer
I just want to know
Can you have the whole thing gone by the weekend
I just want to know
Bitch is you down to fuck a nigga, or you teasing
I just want to know
I just want to know, I just want to know
I just want to know, I just want to know
I just want to know

[Verse 1 – Chinx]
Is the bitch pussy wide, is it narrow
Can I slam it like the judge with the gavel
Did they do the nigga like Harold
And if he your man would you tap him
Do your 9 mil come with the extension
Will the judge grant another month extension
Do your dope house got a lot of traffic
Is the line round the corner, is it clicking
Is the stash big enough to hold a 30
Like sipping drink, do you like sipping dirty
Was your rims passed down to you, did you earn it
When you put your pickle in the bitch was it burning
Got a lot of questions, do you got a lot of answers
Did you cop the car with the yacht and the mansion
Nigga I just want to know
When the shotty hit em did it [?] spread on him like cancer

[Hook]

[Verse 2 – French Montana]
Money talk, niggas ain’t speaking
30 racks a month if I lease it
Fuck a judge, bail out from the precinct
Charge 100 racks for a feature
Rocking NDR, smoking Keisha
Met a bad bitch named Felicia
Took her three outings, one weekend
Catch me in Toronto with The Weeknd
Got the ‘rari in the deacon
Scope with the AR have you leaking
Money in the safe when the work drive nigga
Talk a million cash when the ink dry nigga
Got it, came from the bottom with a couple niggas
250 in the duffel nigga
Coke Boys, streets love a nigga
Niggas gone ball every summer nigga

[Hook]
