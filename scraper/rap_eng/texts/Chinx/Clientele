[Hook x2 : Rich The Kid]
I got bells like trees on Christmas
Like Papa got them chickens
Got a red foreign bitch, she whip it
She can do, she can do the dishes
Clientele, clientele, clientele, clientele
I got bricks I don't need no scale
I'm the plug bitch I got clientele

[Verse 1 : Rich The Kid]
[?] crazy, my bands gone crazy
In the kitchen water whippin' cause I got clientele
I don't need a scale, shift it to the metal
Got all white bitch I ain't tellin' no tale
50 bricks in the ceiling and I ain't talkin' [?]
Big ass blunts you would swear I was Jamaican
True Religion pants got 50k in em'
Foreign bitch like [?]
[?] Maserati
Money real old like Bill Cosby
Droppin' bands in Lennox while you shoppin' at the hobby lobby
My ice, real cold like [?] Spring water
Bitch I am the plug I can take your order

[Hook]

[Verse 2 : Chinx Drugz]
I got bricks I don't need no scale
Get knocked out and gettin' no bail
It's them eastside bricklayer
That Southside cartel
Them hoes love how I roll
Keep bad bitch on their toe
I got the bitch of your dreams
But that's whipping that stove
My watch cost bout fourty
They came with a Glock fourty
You reach for it, you seek for it
We're breaking news, top stories
Them bricks truck we roll up then we hop out
Know a couple real niggas got real money hit rock bottom

[Hook]
