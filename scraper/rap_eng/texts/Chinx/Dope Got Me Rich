(Chinx):
All these money fallin out sky
Seen it grabbed it on caught it by surprise..

That dope got me rich
That drop got me flexin
Blue dot got me lit
Hundred bottles in my section..
TELL THE WAITRESS KEEP COMIN (x4) (wooa)
(x2) (thats riight)

Gotta say them boys em ballin thats a false alarm..
Lay a finger on me pussy thats gon cost your ARM
Three pink suited james brown pal...
Got my fortune on your head now your days are lookin narrow (wssup?)
Party to the A.M we gon fuck some models
They know i manage that dope call me custom lotta...??
This too easy like rocks and paper bags
Looking like drop ain't easy
Then drop a paper towel
Whippin on tah work i call that shit reown... ??
Whole lotta stress I gain with each and every corner
My jewlery dumb, cocaine long
Got like 80 bottles that way
I never heard they commin

That dope got me rich
That drop got me flexin
Blue dot got me lit
Hundred bottles in my section..
TELL THE WAITRESS KEEP COMIN (x4) (wooa)
(x2) (thats riight)

Thousand bottles on my table looking like the plug. Told that dumb get the owner I'm tryin to buy the club. Called my first lick, with it poppin two now. Fuck the bitch, then I took the whole group down. Did it, try to, get a nigga in a suit now. Red bottoms, funny metal on my shoe now. Wander town still ridin with the roof down. Fuck that fire, all my niggas trained to shoot now. I don't date, I'd rather pay for pussy. Nigga sideways, like that asian pussy. Tell the waitress keep it comin, me and drinks keep dumbin. East coast, we runnin
