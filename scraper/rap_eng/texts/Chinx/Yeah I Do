[Hook: Chinx]
Yeah I do
Yeah I do numbers and numbers now
Yeah I do tours in London now
Yeah I do (x2)
Yeah I do pull out the foreign now
Yeah I do come with a chain or two
That's what it's all about
Yeah I do think I'm the shit now
Yeah I do think that you missed out
That's your new wallet? (?)
Yeah I do fuck with them bitches
Yeah I do all that they tell you
Yeah I do (x2)

[Verse 1: Chinx]
Style on dem niggas, money off tourin'
Came up from nothin' so at times I might seem a little distant and cocky
But truth is, I know my position you copyin'
Yeah I do swerve in that foreign
Partyin' from night to the mornin'
You up at home waitin' on me as if I don't care for you
Truth is, you know I was there for you
Bet you knew all of that
Yeah I do mistake (?) you for granted
While I'm alone I regret it, I sip out this double cup
Tell myself like what the fuck is up, thinkin' in retrospect
This wasn't us
Yeah I do, yeah I do
Throw all the shit I done started
I know that it wasn't this way when it started out
I'm tryin to fall in, but we just keep on fallin' out
I just get high and keep drinkin' like
Yeah I do, yeah I do
Keep a couple broads on the phone line
Say don't listen to your girls cause it's all lies
They denying all the rumors for a long time
But a nigga gotta own it cause its all mine
I used to give a fuck about those tabloids and papers now (Yay!)
I know you either gon' love it or hate it now
I hope niggas evolve from all of that hatin'
But until then I won't deny it, I'll tell yo ass

[Verse 2: MeetSims]
How all I ever wanted right here in a situation
Between the women that I'm with and the fuck niggas say they hatin'
I mean I'm cool whether or not a bitch leavin' fuck a conversation
Cuz either way tho, a nigga on the road paper chasin'
Askin' me why do I got that bitch numba
Say what you mean? Thought you was through wit me yesterday
All the meanwhile, niggas up in my ear about your business
I can't be caught up in that shit so
Yeah I do text her from time to time
Yeah I do fuck with her on the low
Yeah I do fuck the bitch
Yeah I do know that this shit hurt
Yeah I do know that this shit hurt, I can't control it tho
Why would think any different?
Why would that make any difference?
Why, would them nights, in that Hotel room, back when we wasn't together
Be reason for you to start trippin'? I'm over it
I gives a fuck about them tabloids and papers now
I know you either gon' love me or hate me now
I hope niggas evolve from all that hate shit
But until then no I won't deny it, I'll tell yo ass
