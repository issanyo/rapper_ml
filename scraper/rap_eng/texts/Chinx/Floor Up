[Hook – Chinx]
Both doors go up
Know we’ll never fold up
Started from the floor
Sipping on the lean, got a nigga moving slow
Snakes in the grass so I went and bought a mower
Never knew the skank but I fuck her like I know her
Shawty will you drop it for a nigga little lower
Stash box incase jackboys trynna roll up
Bought a new hideout, now I’m even lower
Started from the floor

[Verse 1 – Zack]
From the floor up
Got killers on the payroll, floor up
Bring your bitch down and you know [?]
Young Z with the keys boy
Threw 100 Gs on my sleeves boy
Young nigga on freeze boy
Never had a job, I was out dope dealing
You was in the [?] boy
Niggas don’t flex on me boy
Pills got a nigga on p.noid
Hit a nigga dead into the breeze ho
Killers on the guard, they [?]
Keep a nigga head on left side
Still on my block thugging homicide
Young nigga never let the drama slide
Young, young, young, young nigga

[Hook]

[Verse 2 – Chinx]
Nigga stack it to the sky
Then I went and did it twice
Got so high left a nigga scared of heights
If everybody Gs nigga, tell me where the mice
Scratch on your head, I ain’t talking no lice
Remember they ain’t wanna let a nigga get a bite
Nigga ducking bail, I remember those nights
Snatched by the feds, they ain’t reading no rights
Remember a nigga used to move the white up on the blacktop
Pushed the Lamborghini with the headshots
If the nigga owe it tell him drop mine on me
Running through the zoo with some wild coyotes
You can keep the fork nigga, let me get the meal
Just a bunch of jar heads strapped in the field
Cap for his halo, see this ain't a game though
Real life niggas out tryna get a kill

[Hook]
