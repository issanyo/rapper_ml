[Intro: Young Thug]
Yeah, yea, thugging, thugger
Stoners, ha, NYC shit nigga

[Hook: Young Thug]
Pull in and whip it, pull in these bitches
Ran all dem digits, Stack through the ceiling
Ma mamma wit it, my brother wit it
His sisters wit it, these hookers wit it
Coke Boys, let's get it
Coke Boys, let's get it
Dope Boys, let's get it, ha
Coke Boys, let's get it
Dope Boys, let's get it
Everyone, let's get it
Get it, Chinx get it get it

[Verse 1: Chinx Drugz]
I'll be counting all of this paper
Smoking all of this dope
Said I wasn't gon make it
Told me wasn't no hope
Always knew I was gon get it
Add the grease to that chicken
Known to fluff the dope when i whip it (whip that)
Bitch in less than 4 minutes
I got freezer burn on my left arm
Gas hose like Chevron
Shot attempts can't fade me (nope)
Skin made of that Kevlar
Don't get lined up wit dem dots
Made my way up off them blocks
Smoking on a 12 foot yacht, open toe sandals you flop
Talking Coke Boy lets get it
My first tour was cocaine, went back and forth like tennis
In your bitch mouth, no dentist
Nosey bitch mind your business
I'm gon stack it up to that ceiling
I'm in traffic ducking that sentence
Found that pot of gold and dove in it

[Hook: Young Thug]

[Verse 2: Chinx Drugz]
I done came up of dem niggas
Seen the lane and I took it
Stove whipping that eco
Grandma like what's cooking (what's cooking?)
Talking car show, we roll out
Dress warm its cold out
Hard top roof fall out
Too fast bitch slow down
We ride through your street
She dialed up my main line, I slide with your freak
Told her told use no teeth
Came a long way from that bottom
Drinking out that bottle, still chasing em comas
Told me get em I got em
Talking bout the money we blew that
Nigga now why you go do that?
When I pull up she hop in it (skrrr)
Rest of em niggas like who dat?
Style on em niggas the worst way
We don't fuck with them in the first place
Nigga we get it the bitches they wit it
They know I get the pussy on the first date
