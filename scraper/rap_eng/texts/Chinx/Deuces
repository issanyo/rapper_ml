[Chorus]
I ain't fucking wid you bird
I need a bitch like oprah
You hatin nigga's is the worst
Still sleepin on ya momma's sofa
You ain't getting money
Never nigga, gon' fuck yo girl
Gonna buy her what she wants
Give her what she needs
And ya know ya bitch a freak
Woah, woah, woah, woah, woah, woah

[Verse 1]
Uh, you see a nigga focused
Incase you haven't noticed
Baby my heart cold but you see my
Wrists there coldest
And all the bitches love us
They wanna kiss or hug us
They wanna kiss in public and fuck us under covers
Dont matter system of us
I mean neices, cousins a pickle missin rubba's
Babys dis the lova's, shorty rock the wave, icey on my block shades
Five chains on they be dancin from a block away
So rock laungerie, rock fresh obama
Called my first nut when i seen seven zero, comma
That nigga check my line up chink, drugs, flip, g's
Sky high in that spaceship yellin bye bye
I ain't fucking wid you bird
I need a bitch like oprah
You hatin nigga's is the worst
Still sleepin on ya momma's sofa
You ain't getting money never nigga, gon' fuck yo girl
Gonna buy her what she wants get her what she needs
And ya know ya bitch a freak
Woah, woah, woah, woah, woah, woah

[Verse 2]
That's right
She ain't never gon' be shit
Nah, let alone feeel a lever in the in the v-twix
I scoop her straight
On the same night that it ain't
Cause she a bird its cause my game tight
Maybe a lil bit of both
She a crumb snatcher tryna get a loaf from the mac with the most
And we beez the boys with the with the coke and and vise
Versa might work her and then kick her ass out
Do yourself a favor when ya hit it dontcha pass out
Cause she a getcha ya getcha ya getch ya for ya money money
And anything she get her fucking hands on is ugly
She jumpin' outcha wip, just to jump in mine and fuck me

[Chorus]
I ain't fucking wid you bird
I need a bitch like oprah
You hatin nigga's is the worst
Still sleepin on ya momma's sofa
You ain't getting money never nigga, gon' fuck yo girl
Gonna buy her what she wants give her what she needs
And ya know ya bitch a freak
Woah, woah, woah, woah, woah, woah
