[Hook x2: Dave East]
I've been drinking all night, woke up with a hangover
I'mma keep winning, for you it's game over
Pull up on the block in a Range Rover
Shit on these niggas for love they ain't show us

[Verse 1: Dave East]
Hennessy in me, I'm feeling so aggressive
Reminiscing on nights I used to hold that weapon
You can look me in my eyes and you know I'm stressing
Lost in the ghetto, future headed in no direction
But fuck it, crack another bottle, let's get drunk tonight
Wildin' out, that nigga front, it's ten getting jumped tonight
Flying up first ave, hit tenth street, then buck a right
Park up, walk 'em twelve body, ayo fuck your life
Patron was my summer twist, after that was Honey Jack
Music getting hotter now, niggas screaming,"Run that back"
Back woods, now remember asking where them dutchess at
Was ten major sipping cheap vodka, nah I don't fuck with that
Now I'm getting texts saying, "Is you 'bout to blow up?"
I'm still in the [?] with coke-heads and baking soda
Head spinning, need a ginger ale, I'm 'bout to throw up
I told myself I'd never drink again, bring some more cups

I've been drinking all night, woke up with a hangover
I'mma keep winning, for you it's game over

[Verse 2: Dave East]
Last night was mad real
I'mma need more than some sunglasses and Advil
Gotta get this cash still
Last thing I remember taking off my Calvins
She came out of Vickys blowing sticky by the mountain
Rosé champagne spilling like a fountain
Super bent, but thanking God I'm so far from public housing
Tequila with the lemonade, whiskey we be drinking straight
Sipping out the staircase, thinking paper we can make
D'ussé, I be mixing that with [?]
If I throw this paper, she gon' shake it like a red nose
No, this ain't confusing, bitch is choosing then she [?] chose
I'mma G, come and fuck with me cause I said so
[?], VIP bottles keep coming, them haters seeing it
Make sure they sparkle it
Really 'bout that life, you just talking it
Getting bent with me, you more than fortunate
Went from sipping forties, now they sparking it

I've been drinking all night, woke up with a hangover
I'mma keep winning, for you it's game over
Pull up on the block in a Range Rover

[Verse 3: Dave East]
I woke up with a hangover
I'm wishing that the pain over
Pull up on the scene in a Range Rover
Lethal with me, he's a flamethrower
I've been drinking all night
I've got millions at my side
I keep the hammer topped, niggas don't fight
Any problem he got East in the [?]
Switching and rolling, bad bitch got me swollen
Got these lil bitches soaking, got these lil niggas moping
My vision in clearer, you niggas is weirder
Posing as some new niggas [?] your fears

[Hook x2: Dave East]
I've been drinking all night, woke up with a hangover
I'mma keep winning, for you it's game over
