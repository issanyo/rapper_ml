[Intro: Waka Flocka]
White watch, white liquor
Black and white girl, which one to pick bro
It's a perfect picture, stop pose
It's a perfect picture, fuck it

[Verse 1: French Montana]
Stop pose
Make the biggest movies, top down we couping'
Twelve ladies choosing, twelve Bentley's cruising
Grind time we moving, told Flock' to scoop me
I'm by the baggage claim, that package came
Diamonds on my Automar, white tee with the Polo shorts
Wrists about a house or two, imagine what that auto cost
Uno, dos, loco money
Took that top and cut it short
Talk about that choo-choo money, fuck niggas know who to cross
Blowing hella' steam, wavy like submarine
Shorty give me head and wipe me off, now I'm cumming clean
Come on shorty, stop that crime
Drink that liquor, she drink that wine
Hit that once, I don't call that mine
Talk no money, don't call my line

[Verse 2: Waka Flocka]
Twenty-five years old, seen a million plus
Twenty-five years old, I've seen a million plus
I'm like what the fuck is this
Stress costs
Grandma need medicine, stress costs
My partner says his mama's lights got cut off
Plus she's six months behind rent, what the fuck
These niggas second guessing me
I know the fucking recipe
Balling, fuck a referee
Hungry like a refugee
Bricksquad Monopoly

[Verse 3: Chinx Drugz]
Bitches dig me when I ride
Nigga feeling tipsy, got that remy on my mind
Drop the top and let the breeze in
All that fly shit wheeze in
Competition slacking, in the back we got them wheezing
Came up in the game
Stumbled on some change
Coke Boy, that Bricksquad, see every hood the same
Styling on these bitches how I'm supposed to
My Bentley go coastal
Money long, match the numbers in my social
Seven-sixty twirler
Nigga got me early
Never hit the party unless they let me sneak my girl in
We all about it
Top off the coupe, I'm trying to crawl up out it
Coke Boy, nigga tell your girl about it
