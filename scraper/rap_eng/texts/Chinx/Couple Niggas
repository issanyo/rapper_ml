Always see me with a couple niggas
Gettin' money with a couple niggas
Burnin' up the spot, fuckin' up the club, we made it
Hell yeah, couple niggas, got a couple bottles
Got a couple swishas
Couple bands, got a couple bitches
Got the whole block sown up
Ask em who it is, they gon' say a couple niggas
Got a couple problems wid a couple niggas
Tell my niggas grab a couple niggas
Hundred deep inside the club
Now them niggas got a pro'lem with a couple niggas
Keep the burner on me for a couple niggas
Only reason I don't fuck with niggas cause I made it from the
Mother-fuckin'bottom fuckin' with a couple niggas, Nigga yea

[Verse 1: Chinx Drugz]
Do it for the love nigga, snub nose, mask and a glove nigga
Take a side shooter, never going happen
At trial, she was crackin' with a blood nigga
I'm all in tears sweatin blood nigga
Head shot paramedics come and get ya
Gone after pills and a couple of liquor
Still on the block wid a couple niggas
Dread by the bank, nigga we ain't got it
Flights ain't the same, nigga different pilots
Whole lot of change, nigga different wallets
IG laughing at them niggas comments
Teach 'em how to shoot, nigga, triggernomics
Shawty need a ride, I'mma give her molly
If dick is her mind, she gon' get the knowledge
Smokin' lot of loud, but you niggas silent
I think I'm Diddy, I run my whole city, I front on these niggas
Pull out the Phantom, the Rarri, the Lotus
The Aston, Bugatti, then stunt on these niggas
Fuck all these niggas
Ain't a nigga fuckin' wid me
Tell the pussy come and get me (come on)
I be right here with a couple hittas
I be right here with a couple niggas
Get a couple million

[Verse 2: Chinx Drugz]
You niggas on it, whippin' they yay to the moment
Bitches they on me, wasn't gon make it
Thats just what they told me
I Ride wit that 40, this life it cost and I can't afford it
Told y'all we ballin', don't fuck wit them lines
Y'all know they recordin', Roll up with the top down
Pull up and we shut the whole block down
If ain't about a dollar nigga not now
Everything designer from the top down
Coke Boy fresh nigga, rocked out
If you could get cheaper nigga shop 'round
9 millimeter with the Glock rounds
Do it for my niggas still in lock down (Boy)
Talkin' bout the money in a whip game
Nother hundid fifty on the wrist game
Scoop a nigga hard on a late night
She will open wide like a Great White
With them bird flue was a safe line
Pussy niggas know they gonna take flight
When you gettin money, niggas wanna know
What the combination to yo safe locks
