[Hook: Chinx]
Now I lay me down to sleep
Pray to Lord my soul to keep
If I should die before I wake
Just make sure while I was here that I was gettin' it
Now I lay me down to sleep
Kept that money in the family, I was gettin' it
If I should die before I wake
Want my realest niggas to tell em I was gettin' it

[Verse 1: Lil Durk]
Stay in your lane, my niggas can't change
Pour a 4, can't hang
These niggas ain't real, these niggas to blame
These niggas can't aim, you bitches ashamed
Cop me a range
Now I can't sleep, I stay in the street
I stay with the heat, I came with a dream
Now wake up, I make you believe
Stress I don't need, bitch I'm conceited
La la la hope I got that loud for you
Cause niggas say that I really got that loud for you
So god I'ma tell you I'ma ride for you
Cause everybody waving they gon' ride for you
But I don't care, these haters are real
Fame on my machete, these niggas mad cause I changed the year
Rollie on me, my diamonds clear
Spring water, molly water, all the way turned up
Travis Porter I'm a real nigga for ya
Lets get it

[Hook: Chinx]
Now I lay me down to sleep
Pray to Lord my soul to keep
If I should die before I wake
Just make sure while I was here that I was gettin' it
Now I'm living thirsty
Kept that money in the family, I was gettin' it
If I should die before I wake
For my realest niggas to tell em I was gettin' it

[Verse 2: Chinx]
I say fuck niggas don't try, fuck nigga don't try
If I should lay in that box, tell my closest homies don't cry
Cause I been puttin' on for my city
Authentic's, no gimmicks
I got the rocket, went straight to the hole
With no warmups and no scrimmage
Fuck niggas off limits, always on top of my business
Left the projects to that white sand up in St. Croix and Marlennox
I married the streets, kiss my momma goodbye
Don't serve me no dreams, don't tell me no lies
Family always come first 'fore they take me off in that hearse
I left NY to the south side to that Chi-town with Lil Durk
We be the realest don't fuck with no lames
Fuck the police we don't give up no names
Last night I fell asleep and then I had a dream
That a nigga hit me in the brain

[Hook: Chinx]
Now I lay me down to sleep
Pray to Lord my soul to keep
If I should die before I wake
Just make sure while I was here that I was gettin' it
Now I'm living thirsty
Kept that money in the family, I was gettin' it
If I should die before I wake
For my realest niggas to tell em I was gettin' it
