Thats right
I take it from here
Let's get it

What? That's right
Ima coke boy

Straight out the fuck'n dungeons of rap
Where fake niggas dont make it back

R.I.P my brother Stack Bundles
You know that

I'm talking youngin we was mob'n, we was live'n lawless
Clock'n all them dollars, watch'n them informants
Last night I fell asleep, with dreams that be enormous
Then them Ds rush the spot, they said they had a warrant
Choppas for my haters, dollars for my thoughts
Niggas in them pens, blow'n on them Ports
Half a 5th of gin, deal'n with my losses, years later
Same young niggas turn to bosses
Bitches on them poles, try'n to make a live'n
Niggas fuck'n up they re-up, throw'n money at the ceiling
And it was all for the love of drug deal'n
Stick your ear out my window and you hear them shells peel'n
This is what they want, that fit just new york, button up and khakis
Nigga fresh up out of court, niggas started off with weed, graduated to that snort
They got they money up to come and see me on the court
Damn right you know I served them
Sell'n 12-12s to put 20s on suburbans back when niggas rode excursions
And say the wrong word, get your dome lit, youngin why you play'n get the whole brick
Aim'n at your top with extend yoppers, talk'n business with bosses over shrimp and lobster
Comatose'n these rappers, put 'em all to sleep, and papi think I'm Dominican, so I got it cheap
Coke boys ride'n 'till we break the ball bearings
This tech empty out your spot like a store clearance
I'm drip'n in all this poland, thats frozen water
A chemist up on the stove with that boiling water
They say me and my niggas make that south rap, so I let this geechy-ass tech push his mouth back
Yeah they got it, but I take it from here, see we play with no fear, see that cake over there?
I'm get'n tour money, talk'n ball money, we don't need no favors over here
