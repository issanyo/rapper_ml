[Wale]
To be honest they trippin' off little change
Rhymin' remarkable not cognizant of shade nigga
Bright-minded, outfit sharp as hindsight is
Hoes open to him, I ain't talkin' chancletas

[Chinx Drugs]
Grain grippin', stain drippin', nigga shoulder leanin'
Got your main bitch with me and she ain't complainin'
Shawty what your aim is, young rich and famous
Never payin' for the pussy, niggas makin' payments

[Wale]
Bitch, I'm ballin' on the court like a fuckin' plaintiff
Any PYT, a thrill like human nature
You have to get your cake up, you have to get your weight up
I rapture any time, you cats need a Baker

[Chinx Drugs]
I'm from them blocks where they hustle just to get the cake up
For the money I be shakin' like Anita Baker
Chinx Drugs I done blew up like a minefield
These niggas bet I lose, 'ey check side deal

[Wale]
I know my mind real, I know my mind ill
Came in a lane and made paper off of Seinfeld
Enthusiastically curb, know my rap is superb
You get clothes off the rack, I make racks off apparel

[Chinx Drugs]
These niggas actin' like jackin' is thorough
Niggas jackin' my flow, I'm just jackin' they girl
Coke boy stylin' on 'em in my bath robe
Like a bad hand in poker, bet they ass fold

[Wale]
Don't gotta worry, the horny bitches be at my shows
No handouts, but my arms strong like Satchmo
Rap flow is poetry over mad songs
My stats good, I'm backslappin' the stack whoa

[Hook]
Where the G's at, tell me when to go
Tell me where the cheese at, I'm all about the dough
Squad like the dream team, all we rock is gold
If you really real son, let a nigga know

[Wale]
Maryland and DC nigga
Don't forget the VA nigga
Out-of-town, the whole team spillin'
Young king with some Queens bitches

[Chinx Drugs]
Movin' on up, niggas roll up like a locomotive
Perseverance be the key, a nigga so devoted
Fuck myhaters, talkin' youngin', get your bank up
In the clubs poppin' Spade call it Ace Hood

[Wale]
Fuck a lame, NYC my face good
Made this dame give me brain via Facebook
Though I met her off it, I don't respect her often
Cause I ain't have all these broads when I was in a office

[Chinx Drugs]
While they was up in college, I was makin' sales
When they was in the world, I was readin' mail
Fresh off of the strip, they attended Yale
All my niggas afloat, so now I'm fit to sail

[Wale]
Sail, please enunciate Chinx
You know the type of stuntin' we do could fuck up a Brinks
Some niggas hate, some niggas not
I make these niggas catch a shuttle just to catch the flight
