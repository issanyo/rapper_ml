[Chorus: French Montana]
If you want it to be what you want it to be, make it believe
If you want it to be what you want it to be, make it believe

[Verse 1: French Montana]
First things first, I'll pop it
Run up on me and I'll cock it
Started from the bottom, not stoppin'
To this money, nonstop
Coke Boy hairline
Ski mask when it's bread time
Lights camera action, head comin' block
Mouth open, ridin' through the open lock
Couldn't get one off
Now I'm caked up like the sun off
Block, block, watch 'em run off
Shots hit you from the back, rip your front off
Came up, spend a quarter mil a month
We don't take them jets out the country
Doin' shit you can't believe
Green passport, blue visa
Trips overseas

[Chorus: French Montana]
If you want it to be what you want it to be, make it believe
If you want it to be what you want it to be, make it believe

[Verse 2: Chinx]
Look, middle fingers held high
I do it on my own 'til the well run dry
Business ain't business when you mix it with your friends
And these thirsty ass bitches tryna get you for your ends
Fuck 'em all, they know I break it down like a chop shop
Nigga playin' ball, I ain't worried 'bout the shot clock
I'm sippin' white zinfandel with your main bitch
A broke nigga couldn't figure what my aim is
I pull up in a two door
Says she wanna fuck a nigga, I already knew though
Busy counting money, there ain't nothing else to do though
In it to the end but I thought you niggas knew though
You know

[Chorus: French Montana]
If you want it to be what you want it to be, make it believe
If you want it to be what you want it to be, make it believe

[Outro: French Montana]
Every other city we go, same song, baby
Every other city we go, same song
Every other city we go, same song
Every other city we go, same song
I was in the video
Making something serial
Making something last long
