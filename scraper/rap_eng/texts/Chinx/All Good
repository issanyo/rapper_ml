Verse 1: [Chinx]
If I could fuck all these bad bitches, a nigga sure would
Coming through the ghetto, grain grippin' all wood
Where that money coming and going, break ya niggas off
If he was in the field wit cha, go ahead and show him love
But on the flip side, niggas coming at me with they hands out
I told them motherfuckers stand down
I catch him slippin' with his pants down
Break em off, choppa choppa, be a man down

[Hook: Chinx]
Shit ain't always all G, shit ain't always all good
If it was on me, we'd be always all good
Fuck them niggas talking, put that money on the wood
They ever had a doubt, I'm here to tell 'em y'all could
Shit ain't all good nigga, all good nigga
Die as a hood nigga
One time for the traps and the hood bitches
Knew I ball since a little nigga, little nigga
Good nigga

[Verse 2: Bynoe]
I knew I balled since a little nigga
When that money slowed up, it wasn't good nigga
Kevin Costner with the wolves nigga
I dance on 'em once, see my two-step
Paddles on the wheel, tiptronic, that's a new 'vet
I do it for the trap and the hood bitches
Riot be the gang, all bets on that wood nigga
Fo', five, six, that's a head crack
Six out da four, leave your head crack
You weathered that storm or get rained on
Shaq in the paint, drop step and get banged on
I do it for my dogs and my partna dem
Python, kick game like soccer dem
It's the mighty, mighty Riot
Eat with us nigga or you gonna diet
Mob or starve
We all in, we all riot
What up!

[Hook: Chinx]
Shit ain't always all G, shit ain't always all good
If it was on me, we'd be always all good
Fuck them niggas talking, put that money on the wood
They ever had a doubt, I'm here to tell 'em y'all could
Shit ain't all good nigga, all good nigga
Die as a hood nigga
One time for the traps and the hood bitches
Knew I ball since a little nigga, little nigga
Good nigga

[Verse 3: Cau2G$]
Shit ain't all good, but everything is all right
When I lost my nigga, man I cried all night
When he lost his life, my whole world stopped
I think we could bring a plaque back to the Rock
I get chills when I hear it, feel it when I see it
I can have a smile on my face, but don't mean it
I'm in my own zone now, that's why I move alone now
When we all get together, that's when we hold it down

The roof on the thing come out when the sun out
Ridin' in that drop-top Mazi, watch 'em dumb out
We was born to make it
Put some respect on my name or I'ma take it
I'm around like a bracelet
Three stab wounds, had to hide in the bathroom
I'm giving 'em lessons, don't need no classroom
We running this sh--, even if we joggin'
So New York like the Garden
Pardon, Gs!

[Hook: Chinx]
Shit ain't always all G, shit ain't always all good
If it was on me, we'd be always all good
Fuck them niggas talking, put that money on the wood
They ever had a doubt, I'm here to tell 'em y'all could
Shit ain't all good nigga, all good nigga
Die as a hood nigga
One time for the traps and the hood bitches
Knew I ball since a little nigga, little nigga
Good nigga

[Verse 4: Stack Bundles]
It's a whole lot of kitty talk, not without Seymour (nah)
Patty cake, patty cake, youngin, I see more
C4, the Mercury switches, the worst on these bitches
Hoe wanna blow when you show 'em the glow
Rhyme slow like numbers on an R&B singer
The name ring bell like Stringer
I'm so educated like a nigga graduated from Yale
Flyin' and I'm glitterin', call me Tinkerbell
Peter Pan wasn't an option when I was in the mix
I needed something with options, I was in a mix
I owned half the building, wanted some for half a million
Two-tone Phantom, half the ceiling
We ain't have to have a mitt to start catching feelings
Just enough to make niggas want to snatch your children (okay)
Louis monograms where the rats get sealed in
The potato on the front for when the cats start peelin'

[Hook: Chinx]
Shit ain't always all G, shit ain't always all good
If it was on me, we'd be always all good
Fuck them niggas talking, put that money on the wood
They ever had a doubt, I'm here to tell 'em y'all could
Shit ain't all good nigga, all good nigga
Die as a hood nigga
One time for the traps and the hood bitches
Knew I ball since a little nigga, little nigga
Good nigga
