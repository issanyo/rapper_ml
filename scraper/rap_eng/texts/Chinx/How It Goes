[Verse 1: Chinx Drugz]
Shit! Look, its only right I'm styling

Run up on a bird brain, and push his beat back

[Verse 3:Rico]
I done bought clean cars off dirty money
Pitching rocks, different blocks
Had them D's searching for me
Made headlines, type of money we chasing
You facing fed time, we push it to the red line
Keeps a clean girl, that likes to talk dirty
Know this adress is me, but her walk's dirty
She likes them foreign v's, thats how I caught her lurking
But play her close, you fall asleep that bitch'll close your curtains
I keep them souijas working, the block is up n' running
I cook a quarter key, and pass it to my youngens
Them shooters up n' gunning, dont try to test us
Chop a head a nigga body from the chest up
