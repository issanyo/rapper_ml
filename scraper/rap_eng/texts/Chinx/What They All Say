We been pushing the foreign, touring, my nigga we up
We been checking the scoreboard, my nigga we up
Got this kush in the foreign, pourin' and rollin' weed up
Out here screaming free my niggas till my niggas freed up
We been pushing the foreigns, touring, my nigga we up
We been checking the scoreboard, my nigga we up
Got this this kush in the foreign car, now roll the weed up
I done heard the shit they talking all before, I know I know I know
That’s what they all say, that’s what they all say
All my niggas ride foreigns, that’s what they all say
I got bad bitches calling, that’s what they all say
Every nigga with me balling, that’s what they all say

[Verse 1: Chinx]
I need Off-Spray on my line, probably got bugs on my phone
On my off day I got more haters tryna toss something at my dome
Let your broad play with these jawbreakers, she scoring while you at home
Whips in all flavors, we ball players, no roof cover my dome
Burn them C notes, change the weight by the keyroll
Homies behind the G wall, hold your head up, I see y’all
Niggas know I be on top of money, letting that dough pile right on
Catch the wrong vibe and them boys crowding right outside of your home
On my ten toes, my eyes wide, my trap house all lop sided
Shoutout my connect, and my phone stored this wifi
From G5 to that money, chuck a peace sign at your honey
Fuck the award shows and your talk shows, them streets always gone love me

[Verse 2: Chinx]
From that milk crate and that corner store, and that small chicken lo-mein
All my shooters good from that outside, my friends' shots gone rang
I got four hoes, they mouths wide, tryna drop my Balmain's
Caught you hopping out that cop ride, you probably dropped four names
Kept that work on me, I jam like that trunk with four 12s
I can’t hold hands, no grown man, you gone grind yourself
I be throwing bands at hoes dancing, my right or to my left
Live that rock life, that spotlight, don’t shine as bright as my bezel
Smoking, drinking, party, shawty hit this Marley
Blew a nigga brains out, then she get the charges
Ever sober hardly, just that type of party
I won’t put your name on, but I use a sharpie
