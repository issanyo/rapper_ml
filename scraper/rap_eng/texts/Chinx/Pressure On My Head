[Chorus: French Montana]
Getting wasted, all this pressure on my head
Mind playing tricks, think I'm going crazy
Baby momma need time, homies from the feds calling
Nigga on the grind, but they think a nigga balling
Getting wasted, all this pressure on my head
Mind playing tricks, think I'm going crazy
Baby momma need time, homies from the feds calling
Nigga on the grind, but they think a nigga balling
Getting wasted, all this pressure on my head
Mind playing tricks, think I'm going crazy
Baby momma need time, homies from the feds calling
Nigga on the grind, but they think a nigga balling
Getting wasted, all this pressure on my head
Mind playing tricks, think I'm going crazy
Baby momma need time, homies from the feds calling
Nigga on the grind, but they think a nigga balling

[Verse 1: French Montana]
Think about the time caught the goose bumps
Got me smoking weed, sipping goose rum
They said a couple pills help you fix the pain
Make a couple Ms, watch your niggas change
Turn to chapter four, nigga, page three
Made it out of hood, out of jail, but you ain't free
Riding with a couple killers but a nigga dirty too
Tryin' judge my bitch, but a nigga moving dirty too
He stopped selling coke, now is home invasion
He stopped telling jokes, 'cause he broke and wasted
Being broke and dirty gave a nigga chills
Told me grimy niggas be the niggas making mills

[Chorus: French Montana]
Getting wasted, all this pressure on my head
Mind playing tricks, think I'm going crazy
Baby momma need time, homies from the feds calling
Nigga on the grind, but they think a nigga balling
Getting wasted, all this pressure on my head
Mind playing tricks, think I'm going crazy
Baby momma need time, homies from the feds calling
Nigga on the grind, but they think a nigga balling
Getting wasted, all this pressure on my head
Mind playing tricks, think I'm going crazy
Baby momma need time, homies from the feds calling
Nigga on the grind, but they think a nigga balling
Getting wasted, all this pressure on my head
Mind playing tricks, think I'm going crazy
Baby momma need time, homies from the feds calling
Nigga on the grind, but they think a nigga balling

[Verse 2: Chinx]
Try and try again, my efforts ain't enough
Wrap money slow, I'm still trying to slang them stuff
My pops hit the same vase every time
Bright and early in the morning chasing so his moms
The answer's right in front of us, yet so sublime
Before we count this money up just close the blinds
Round the way kid, dreams at the Continental
Couple homies thug I murdered, but that's confidential
My little brother Wax, he be home in August
Sitting in that small cell, but his dreams enormous
Dirty paths, but my future's spotless
Car full on that turnpike, know they watching
Tracks here on Earth, but my mental out on Pluto
Cocaine music, snort it, nigga, this that pure dope
Ain't too much left for a hustler to do though
My theme music Harold, Melvin, & the Bluenotes

[Chorus: French Montana]
Getting wasted, all this pressure on my head
Mind playing tricks, think I'm going crazy
Baby momma need time, homies from the feds calling
Nigga on the grind, but they think a nigga balling
Getting wasted, all this pressure on my head
Mind playing tricks, think I'm going crazy
Baby momma need time, homies from the feds calling
Nigga on the grind, but they think a nigga balling
Getting wasted, all this pressure on my head
Mind playing tricks, think I'm going crazy
Baby momma need time, homies from the feds calling
Nigga on the grind, but they think a nigga balling
Getting wasted, all this pressure on my head
Mind playing tricks, think I'm going crazy
Baby momma need time, homies from the feds calling
Nigga on the grind, but they think a nigga balling
