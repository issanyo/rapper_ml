[Chorus: MeetSims]
Fuck them niggas, baby you gon' love me
Got you back to back, all in Ferraris
Know you lit, you with Young Abu Dhabi
Don't you worry girl, I'm on your body
Tell your nigga bye, you'll see him later
Down in South Beach, got you ballin', cross-ups and some layups
Girl I know you know you lit, you with Young Abu Dhabi
Don't you worry girl, I'm on your body

[Verse 1: Chinx]
I got money on my line, you know that shit be callin'
Pull up on her in the ride and let her whip the foreign
They be talkin' 'bout my bitch, yeah that’s a different story
Nigga talkin' 'bout the crib, yeah that's a couple stories
And shawty gettin' high, you know we sittin' way up
Average nigga ain’t gon' get it, gotta get your weight up
Niggas shinin' like a diamond, all them niggas flawless
And if yo' chick outta line, then tell that chick to fall in (Da-da-da)
Get that money, motherfuck a hater
Tell your nigga bye, you’ll see him later
Pull that Porsche up then we pull the Wraith in
Shawty leavin' with me, ain’t no ultimatum
Woop, woop, woop

[Chorus: MeetSims]
Fuck them niggas, baby you gone love me
Got you back to back all in Ferraris
Know you lit, you with Young Abu Dhabi
Don't you worry girl, I'm on your body
Tell your nigga bye, you'll see him later
Down in South Beach, got you ballin', cross-ups and some layups
Girl I know you know you lit, you with Young Abu Dhabi
Don't you worry girl, I'm on your body

[Verse 2: Chinx]
All we do is count this money, getting to the bank (To the bank)
I be slidin' on them lames like a set of skates (Set of skates)
Never pay attention to 'em, we just let 'em hate (Let 'em hate)
Me and shawty burning weed up by the fireplace
They be tryna find out any reason just to fade us (Fade us)
Make it look like we ain't never stressin' and we paid up
I ain't never trip but you the only one who's fallin' (Fallin')
Got the thing wetter than the floods up in New Orleans (Da-da-da)
Tell the truth, do it look like we stressin'? (Like we stressin')
We be stylin' on 'em, super flexin' (Super flexin')
Never mind the price, no need to check it (No need to check it)
You know you my baby, ain't no second guessin' (Yeah)

[Chorus: MeetSims]
Fuck them niggas, baby you gone love me
Got you back to back all in Ferraris
Know you lit, you with Young Abu Dhabi
Don't you worry girl, I'm on your body
Tell your nigga bye, you'll see him later
Down in South Beach, got you ballin', cross-ups and some layups
Girl I know you know you lit, you with Young Abu Dhabi
Don't you worry girl, I'm on your body
