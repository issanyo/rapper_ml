[Hook – Chinx][x2]
Come and holla at a nigga some time
Come and holla at a nigga some time
Certified nigga, I be on it
Got that money coming way too much to fold it
Know a nigga on it

[Verse 1 – Chinx]
Shawty know I'm bout to scooper scrape
Money coming in, you know I'm super straight
I hold that money down like a paperweight
Mines heavy, what your paper weigh?
That president you’re burning, chill, [?]
My shooters banging 'till your fucking wig fall off
My niggas on that murder, [?], death kill fuck a hater
That's right, I done went left field for the paper
Your main squeeze sucking niggas dry
Fuck the streets you should’ve chose school [?]
It’s Chinx Drugz, I'm the nigga with the juice super loose
Grab your pistols, fuck a truce

[Hook][x2]

[Verse 2 – Plenty]
Four bad bitches in the living room, I’m on my new shit
If it ain't bout residuals then I ain’t get with you
Fuck a critical, I need that nigga casket closed
Fast life, lifting money and hoes is all I know
Crap ass niggas from the bottom of the barrel
Want to catch me at the light and pray I'm slipping like I’m Harold
It’s past sad though, you niggas pathetic
You wanna roll with the kings, you think I'm Tyreke Evans
Because I'm balling, but she won't get a ransom up out of me
Drugz said it ain’t a youngin in the streets as hot as me
I gotta be the next nigga in line
Haters pray on my demise, I just laugh and tell they hoes
