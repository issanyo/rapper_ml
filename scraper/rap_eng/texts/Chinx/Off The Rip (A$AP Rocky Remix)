[Intro: French Montana]
Oh me, oh my my (Haan!)
Gon' need more quinine (Montana!)
Oh me, oh my my (Haan! Off the rip)
Gon' need more quinine (Aye aye aye)

[Bridge: French Montana]
I'ma ride with my dog off the rip
Talkin' brown bag, paper tag off the rip
Shawty came through, bent it over off the rip
Dope boy back, poppin' tags off the rip, nigga off the rip
Started from the block, dirty money off the rip
Cut a shark fin, talkin' money off the rip
Walk up on the dealer, a hundred fifty off the rip
My dog came home, buck fifty off the rip
Haan!

[Hook: Chinx Drugz & (French Montana)]
Oh me, oh my my
Cut dope, gon' need more quinine (off the rip)
Oh me, oh my my
Cut dope, gon' need more quinine (off the rip)
Forty knock his head off (off the rip)
Drop top V, niggas sped off (off the rip)

[Verse 1: A$AP Rocky]
Lord Pretty Flacko remix it off the rip
Do it for the west side, 125th
Do it for the South Bronx, my niggas on the strip
RIP to Chinx and shout outs my nigga French
Met a bitch with this nigga Yams tatted on her tit
Nigga pay attention, I'm the main event
Walk up in the buildin' like a nigga pay the rent
Too legit, ever since I was a dipshit
Even then, niggas wasn't fuckin' with my wrist flick
Quick fix, wrist swish, whippin' up the Bisquik
Even then, most of y'all was jumpin' on my bitch dick
Jeans with the rip, tuck my shirt into my hip
Belt game still sick, Goyard on the print
Off the rip

[Hook: Chinx Drugz & (French Montana)]
Oh me, oh my my
Cut dope, gon' need more quinine (off the rip)
Oh me, oh my my
Cut dope, gon' need more quinine (off the rip)
Forty knock his head off (off the rip)
Drop top V, niggas sped off (off the rip)

[Verse 2: Chinx Drugz]
Coke Boys get the bloody money, dirty cash
Live niggas who smoke weed, car seat stashed
You monkey walk, I'm hunchbacked, speak quiet
Talking 'bout mi casa, scared to death when I pop up

[Bridge: French Montana]
I'ma ride with my dog off the rip
Talkin' brown bag, paper tag off the rip
Shawty came through, bent it over off the rip
Dope boy back, poppin' tags off the rip, nigga off the rip
Started from the block, dirty money off the rip
Cut a shark fin, talkin' money off the rip
Walk up on the dealer, a hundred fifty off the rip
My dog came home, buck fifty off the rip
Haan!

[Hook: Chinx Drugz & (French Montana)]
Oh me, oh my my
Cut dope, gon need more quinine (off the rip)
Forty knock his head off (off the rip)
Drop top V, niggas sped off (off the rip)
Oh me, oh my my
Cut dope, gon need more quinine (off the rip)
Forty knock his head off (off the rip)
Drop top V, niggas sped off (off the rip)

[Verse 3: French Montana]
Started with a hooptie and I went and got a Beamer
Pull up in a boat, titanic La Marina
Shout out to young gunner, spend a hundred on my timer
Looking through the smoke and mirrors, smoking marijuana
Rarri and the Gatti and the Beamers and the Benzes
Homicide tryna knock my door off the hinges
Riding with some cubans that be fresh up out that border
Making back a whole thang, breaking down a quarter
Drophead, getting dome, riding through New Orleans
Hear them shots ringing then I hit that money caller
Counting up my blessings, counting money keep a dollar
Drophead white mink on when it's cold out

[Hook: Chinx Drugz & (French Montana)]
Oh me, oh my my
Cut dope, gon need more quinine (off the rip)
Forty knock his head off (off the rip)
Drop top V, niggas sped off (off the rip)
Oh me, oh my my
Cut dope, gon need more quinine (off the rip)
Forty knock his head off (off the rip)
Drop top V, niggas sped off (off the rip)

[Verse 4: N.O.R.E.]
Coke Boys get the coke money, plenty cash
Live niggas just smoke ash, Phantom seat stashed
You donkey walk, I'm hunchbacked, buck quiet
Talking 'bout mi casa, you TMZ niggas gossip

[Outro: French Montana]
Off the rip, off the rip
Off the mothafucking rip, boy
