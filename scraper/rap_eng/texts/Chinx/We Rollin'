[Verse 1]
My buzz getting bigger
It's growing like a tumor
I'm really a big deal, it ain't a fucking rumor
Keep high, light the room up
They can't help but stare
My heart pump that trill shit, I never dealt with fear
Is he bad or what?
Still catch him bagging up
Rap like they Jeezy but they lines ain't adding up
Fuck he supposed to be, Jesus on a rosary
Drugs, I got this whole shit covered like upholstery
Two model bitches, one did a line
The other popped a E, both of 'em gon' pop for me
If it ain't for the homies, the hoe is not for me
Before you step in the loft, bitch wipe your feet
Yo Fraud, this shit is crazy, it sounds like defeat
The riots still got game and you can die for free
Huh, nigga we low up in them trenches
Came a long way from them courts approaching the benches

[Hook]
We rollin', all of us ride
If a nigga out of line, put my life on the line
Get money all of the time
Keep a nigga out the lime
If I'm lying then I'm flying

[Verse 2]
Right now I'm chasing money, I get with these suckers sharply
Burning up while I'm steaming like a cup of coffee
The sole reason why I can't keep these heifers off me
Fly nigga way before I put them labels on me
I took heed to what the older motherfuckers told me
Fuck if they say we went to school together, they don't know me
I'm into bigger shit, bigger businesses
Bigger Benzes, nigga what the business is?
I been touching grip, moving out them crack houses
Vintage hustler shit, boy I'm so nostalgic
Watch yo lips 'cause the feds might be tapping in
A hundred years for conspiracy of trafficking
Nigga, I'm back again
Fresh like a nigga just came out of the packaging
Posted like what's happening
I'm the hottest motherfucker on the street
You gone have to move the ground to take me off of my feet
