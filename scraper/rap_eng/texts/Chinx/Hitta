My youngin he just beat a body
Probably catch him in your lobby
Blowing marijuana in them trenches
Nozzle on this mac is well extended
Nobody tell or he gone hit the witness
Drop the bag and you gone get the business
Cause I brought my hitter with me, and they don’t talk
Cause I brought my hitter with me, little niggas just shot
Only 19 with a Glock 19, tell him go then the light turns green
Nigga get found in your drop top lean, never too far, know I keep em on the wing
I brought my hitter with me, and they don’t talk
I brought my hitter with me, little niggas just shot
I brought my hitter with me, and they don’t talk
I brought my hitter with me, little niggas just shot
I brought my hitter with me

[Verse 1]
I just hit another lick, the bank is never folding
Run up on a nigga, pussy nigga owe me money, tell him let me hold it
M16 with the scope, and my lil nigga down to do it for the love
Nothing but the G shit run through the blood
High as fuck nigga on three different drugs
All a nigga need is a mask and a glove
They ain’t talking money, tell them niggas not now
Young nigga balling and the whip ride out
Cock shit back, let the shit slide out
Hit him in the cap, then we hit the hideout
Chill for a second, let the beef die down
They don’t think I’m with it, nigga you can find out
Sipping on drink, talking four or five ounce
Young nigga hit a nigga, less than five hours
Five dollars, watch a fuck nigga call a timeout
Got a couple chains on, nigga shine out
No top on the roof, watch a nigga climb out
Climb out, ride out, turn this motherfucker inside out
Phone in the traphouse, won’t dial out
Came with the game, nigga won’t file out

[Verse 2]
Fucked up when they let a young nigga in the game
Courtside seats, got a couple wild freaks going hard on them niggas in the paint
Truth is shawty she don’t really love a nigga, she done really fell in love with the name
Came from the streets, heart cold than the heat, do a tour nigga, for a little change
Drinking out the bottle, niggas smoking California, blowing on the finest
Hella marijuana right in front the projects, niggas tryna move the product
I just bought a box of choppers, only take em out the closet for the oppers
Styling on them niggas, fucking all they bitches, hit the bank and make deposits
My hitters all about the violence, all a nigga known was the dope game
Numb a niggas nose when the coke came
Heart turned cold when the dope came
Grind for the dough like the four train
Four train, four train, niggas only do it big with the caps lock
Lock shit down with the padlock, to the rap game from the back block
