[Hook:]

I be hoppin' on that money, I be hoppin' on your bitch
She be hoppin' out them clothes just to hop up on this dick
I be hoppin' out that plane just to hop up in that whip
I gets it poppin' every time
My nigga hop up on my dick
Roll one, pop a pill and pour it up
Roll one, pop a pill and pour it up
Roll one, pop a pill and pour it up
Roll one, pop a pill and pour it up
I got goons on my left, I got G's all in my right
Got drink all in my cup. Got your bitch all in my sight

[Verse 1:]

We be mobbin' like a mother fucker don't we
Fuck nigga actin' way too familiar, he don't know me
Pour the stuff and get the pills, style on niggas for the thrill
Try and infiltrate, long ass nozzle in your grill
All my real niggas feel me though. Bitch can you hear me, huh?
Unloyal niggas start to wear you down. The wear and tear is crucial
Niggas claim they love you boy, ain't none them niggas truthful
Sometimes it's better to be neutral
I got tatts all over my skin, got your bitch all on in my lap boy
I'm back on my shit, coke boy what's happenin'

[Hook]

[Verse 2:]

New coupe on Rodeo Drive
Tryna and find me a bad bitch that don't tell lies
But the chance of that, that's slim to none
Fuck it I'm smokin', already on my second lung
Gettin' money, countin' ends. Different flavors, I be hoppin' in
Still throwin' my gang up, them fuck niggas gon' hang up
They peep up how I came up posted with the same cup
But niggas they don't love you no more, no more, no more...when you getting money and you stay on the road, the road, the road

[Hook]
