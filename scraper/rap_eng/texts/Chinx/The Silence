[Intro]
Too much ground to cover
I don't know where to start
Can't find the words to tell you
I don't know where to start

[Hook: French Montana]
What ya gonna do when them boys come
Knocking at your front door
And they want war? Oh shit!
He ain't a rapper, he'll kill you
My life
Niggas just need to chill
Tryin' to live my life
But niggas wanna see me killed

[Verse 1: French Montana]
It was cold on that corner
Lot of my niggas gone on that corner
Now it's floor seats, ringside by the ropes
Floor seats, playoffs by the coach
I know you hear me on your radio
I know you watch me in the video
Feds ain't watchin, niggas tellin'
That's why I'm Gucci, deal with Gucci
I'm ridin' clean, look at me
Tee the blur ova lock, wicked block
I'm drinkin' blue down for the pain
But fuck what you say, you's a lame

[Pre-hook]
So we'll sit here in the silence
And watch the sun go down
And wonder if we'll ever
Meet again on higher ground

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Chinx]
Lookouts on the corners, knockers on the aves
Snitches in the window, hoes sucking, giving up the info
Tryna escape thru that brown water
Play king till they gems get snatched outta they crowns
And what beef? Those are cow's organs
It ain't no problem, cuz if it was, he wouldn't be around walking
And fuck holding me up, I ain't no picket sign
My closest nigga crossed me like the Mason-Dixon line
Real nigga, we on different times
Already left these fuck niggas twice, waiting on them at the finish line
Clouds dark, shades even darker
That quick you get stripped outta yo life, Mary Hartman

[Pre-hook]
