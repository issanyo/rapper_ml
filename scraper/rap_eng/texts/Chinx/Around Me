I don't need no fuck niggas around me, I don't want
I don't keep no fuck niggas around me,  I don't need
I don't want no fuck niggas around me, I don't want
I said I don't keep no fuck niggas around me, I don't need

[Verse 1]
Yay
Money on the wood, bankstop [?]
Fuck what a nigga got in it (fuck 'em)
Ballin' on them hardwood floors
Even up in the 9th inning
Still mix pills with the drink
Fuck him and fuck what he think
I ain't gotta plot on ya safe
They hand me wine when I step in the bank

Money bag know a nigga get to it (Yay!)
Used to cut beef with a steak knife
Now a nigga jitsu it
Shit a nigga seen couldn't live through it (Coke Boy)
Nigga used to stop at the red light
Now a nigga dip through it

[Hook]
I don't need no fuck niggas around me, I don't want
I don't keep no fuck niggas around me,  I don't need
I don't want no fuck niggas around me, I don't want
I said I don't keep no fuck niggas around me, I don't need

[Verse 2]
Heading to the money full speed
Close mouthed nigga you don't eat
I be hitting licks all week
Bitch look better on her knees (Yay!)
Serve her that Wang Alexander
Nigga gon' pay me like Sandra
Miami Beach in a Lambo
Right from the building across
I watch them kick in the bando

I got the work out the Port
Came through the block in a Porsche
Light up the loud like a torch
You work for 12, you the force (?)
Chopper out my whip (?)
Hop outta the window in shorts

[Hook]
I don't need no fuck niggas around me, I don't want
I don't keep no fuck niggas around me,  I don't need
I don't want no fuck niggas around me, I don't want
I said I don't keep no fuck niggas around me, I don't need
