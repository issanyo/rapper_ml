(Intro)
(Cashis & Bobby Creekwater)

The Motherfucking Gangster And A Gentleman (Oh)
I Am The Gangster Capo Cashis
Creek The Gentleman, Swag On Them (Ha-Ha)
Put Your Hands Up, Now Put Your Hands Up (Yeah Man)
What Up A-Town (We Worth All That)
We About To Show You How We Make Are Shady Narcotics
(Cashis What Up, Lets Say We Get To This Niggas One Time)

(Bobby Creekwater)
The Soft Leather In The Cope Got Me Going Hard
Her Soft Lips And The Brain Got Me Growing Smart
Oh Lord I'm So Caught Up In This Life Style
Cold Hearted Every Now And Then I Might Smile
Spend A Day In My Shoes, And Walk A Light Mile
I Need A Big Problem, Money Fucking Light Pile
My Style So Similar To Yero, A Surgeon With The Word Play Nero

(Chorus)
(Bobby Creekwater)
Please Don't Be A Hero, We Shut Shit Down
And We Want It All, Not Now But Right Now
Blow The Safe, Put The Money In The Bag
Not Enough Room Wit A Drag

(Cashis)
I'm Running In The Bank Like Buck, I Don't Give A Fuck
Flagged Down, Half Broke, Looking Like Nigga What
I'm The Phillie-up, Still Hittin Niggas Up
Foe-Fim Pull My Dump, See 50 What
Spit Blood, Piss Suds In Your Rental Truck
Lite A Blunt, Found A Pretty Little Bitch To Fuck
Hear Your Rap Songs, Thinking That You Really Suck
I'm A Bigger Boss, Bigger Dick, Really Nuts
Better Feel Me Russ, Nigga I Ain't Feeling Duck
I'ma Find Your Ass Down, Let Me Trigger Fuck
I'm In Your City Chump, You Ain't Owned By Anyone
And If I Smack A Bitch Nigga, Chump I'm Getting Bust
I Got Explosive Drugs, Highly Banned Solder Stuff
You Better Recognize A G When You Close To One
I'm Real Life Gang Type, With The Focus Spun
You In My Sights, I'ma Show You Who The Locus Cuz

(Chorus)
(Bobby Creekwater)
Please Don't Be A Hero, We Shut Shit Down
And We Want It All, Not Now But Right Now (By Now Man)
Blow The Safe, Put The Money In The Bag (Come On Man)
Not Enough Room Wit A Drag (You Know The Routine)

(Bobby Creekwater)
I'm Oh So Era, Get, Checked On This Rap
I Hear You Niggas, Rap Dre's Vent
But It Don't Matter None, We Elephants To An Ant
I'm Not The One For No, Probably Or Can't
You Niggas Sound For Me, Like Chant You Pansies
Any Hater Can't Get My Middle, Forlangie
I Guess The Question For Then You Niggas Is Can we
Well Yes We Can, Obama Me Man
You Probably Get Your Lanes Gone For Feed Man
Goons With Weapons in The Air, Like He Man
You Say Bobby In The Future, I Don't Agree Man
I Had Become Everything I Wanted To Be Man
They Call Me Creek, And Now A Days I Don't See Land
Down Underwater Like A Seaman
Ay Homie
If You Mention One You Mention All, Cause its We Man
And That's The Way Its Going To Motherfucking Be Man

(Chorus)
(Bobby Creekwater)
Please Don't Be A Hero, We Shut Shit Down
And We Want It All, Not Now But Right Now (Right Now Nigga)
Blow The Safe, Put The Money In The Bag (Yeah)
Not Enough Room Wit A Drag

(Take The Capes Of Nigga)
