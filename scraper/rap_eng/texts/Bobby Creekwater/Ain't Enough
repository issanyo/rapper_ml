[Verse 1]
Yeah
Papa's livin life off the cuff, so we selling that stuff
And we done came up rough, and ain't nobody up
And that is why we lookin, and that is why we cookin
Like we've ended up chef-ing, in somebody kitchen tryna
Modify the method
And not to send a message
And nothin else we never ever ever come in second
Surrounded by the women who would prefer to be naked
They only told us make it, not be careful how you make it
Be careful how you take it
But get it how you need it
Go get it for ya momma, go get it for ya kids
And what you doin matters, never mind what you did
It means about as much as exfoliating the kids
We just wanted things, women who had grip that kinda tight
But don't cling
And niggas who know how to hold a note but won't sing
My partner used to love to start a fight but wouldn't swing
He thinking 'poor thing', but that nigga would blast
And make ya whole crew hop the fence right fast
A hundred yard dash, a hundred in the math
And I ain't one to brag, he the main one to brag
[ ? ]
But now they fall off, and kids who had never heard of cash
All lost, and action is alone cause the crowd all talk
But death to a faker all bullets all chalk
And fuck what it cost, cause its never enough

[Hook]
Even if your partner got a plug, ain't enough
Even if you got enough to buy the club, ain't enough
Even if the women come in twos, ain't enough
Even if yo baby momma being cool, ain't enough
Even if you got the newest Benz, ain't enough
Got a bunch of diamonds in your grin, ain't enough
Even if the world is at your feet, ain't enough
You wanna open [?] on the same street, ain't enough
