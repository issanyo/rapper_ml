VERSE 1
I dont mean to be rude but
Most all ya muthfuckas suck, what
You dont understand that a man is man when he develop a plan and he got guts
Nuts over size cahones do it right now you can count money sooner
Black track suit and some all white pumas
Lost in a cloud, no time for the rumour
Tryin to get some of that feta scratch
You against me nigguh mismatch
Couple more blunts a?
And cool like a guy with a eyepatch
I back, spinal, what I say go muthafucka thats final
'Case you never heard of me I'm [b-b-b-bobby creek]...

CHORUS
...I'm blowin [dope out my, dope out my, dope out my window]
I'm blowin [dope out my, dope out my, dope out my window]
I'm blowin [dope out my, dope out my, dope out my window]
I'm blowin [dope out my, dope out my, dope out my window]

VERSE 2
First off I roll up a lil somethin'
Windows down this shit bomb
Love the girls that be fryin'
Them the ones that I want
Shawty said her names Anna
Born in Atlanta
College educated plus fine grammer grammer
Ass shots titty's done
Bad mamma jamma
Couple screw's loose but I still wanna hammer
She use to that lobsta
So I grab a cup and no whoppas
Upsize the value meal to sprite on ice some vodka
Cuttin in the braun won't make to morn'
She had a blueberry bra, rasberry thong
Strawberry kush we smokin goin she bowing to the song she blowin' I'm blowing...

CHORUS
...[dope out my, dope out my, dope out my window]

VERSE 3
Live and direct from one point olan?
Betch ya I can take yo hoe man
Bobby creek come through
Take money from the rich man and give it all to the poor man
Whatever, whenever
We in my penlight and freedom fight till it most likely I will die for whatever
[re-re-reason]
My my how things have changed
They killing lame over nouns and verbs
And material things that dont mean shit
We should all be ashamed in the grand scheme of it
Eat a dick in public, yup you gotta love it
I said my piece got it off my chest
Get off my back
Oh...by the way my name is [B-B-B-Bobby creek] and this is Stat..

{Stat Quo}
VERSE 4
...Quo on his yogi purp in my stogie
Bitch making wishes on my dates so they blow me
Downtown L.A. got me feeling like I'm Kobe
Beverly Hills in a swimming pool I'm cool as Axel Foley
I'mma mothufuckin' menace, these niggas ???? up in it
No playboy I dont hate scrimmage
Ball hard cause I'm in it for the penny
Lil mama tried to say she independant
Till the cheque fell through and her rent was due
Now she out there whorin'
Anotha day anotha daughter BITCH I'm blowing...

CHORUS
...[dope out my, dope out my, dope out my window]
I'm blowin [dope out my, dope out my, dope out my window]
I'm blowin [dope out my, dope out my, dope out my window]
B-Bitch I'm blowin [dope out my, dope out my, dope out my window]
