[Hook]
I'm the man with the plan
Got them pussy niggas mad
Now I'm playing with the bag
Four coup do the dash
We used to be broke, nigga look at us
I don't know nobody killing us
I kill a nigga with the swag
I'm the motherfucking man
Now I'm playing with the bag
Now I'm playing with the bag
Now I'm playing with the bag
Now I'm playing with the bag
Now I'm playing with the bag
Now I'm playing with the bag
Now I'm playing with the bag
Kill a  nigga with the swag

[Verse 1: Coca Vango]
Moving the dope, whipping the coke
You should do whatever works for you
Tattoos all over my face and shit
How in the fuck could I work for you
Finessing the jig in the flotter
Moving them blocks 'cross the water
You said I would never be shit
Now I throw dick in your daughter
Carry money like baby nigga
My young niggas signed a baby nigga
My OG was signed to Shady nigga
All my life I've been a famous nigga
I do everything you wanna do
I fuck all the hoes you wanna fuck
Always been about Milwaukee Bucks
I push her into the double clutch
We the coolest niggas in your town
Diamonds dancing shit like Bobby Brown
Young nigga really stay down
Killing niggas with my own sound
I paint the picture like Van Gogh
Stacks on the side with the payroll
Bitches say this nigga heaven sent
Fucking your hoe in the halo
It's cold

I'm the man with the plan
Got them pussy niggas mad
Now I'm playing with the bag
Four coup do the dash
We used to be broke, nigga look at us
I don't know nobody killing us
I kill a nigga with the swag
I'm the motherfucking man
Now I'm playing with the bag
Now I'm playing with the bag
Now I'm playing with the bag
Now I'm playing with the bag
Now I'm playing with the bag
Now I'm playing with the bag
Now I'm playing with the bag
Kill a nigga with the swag

[Verse 2: Bobby Creekwater]
Laughing at them, I just pull up on them
I just push a button, that's a new discussion
We just gon' get it and get it and get it
And you just get nothing that's true deduction
I may not ever fuck with these niggas
But I got a bag though
I may not remember none of these hoes
But I pop a tag though
Pardon the ego but I come from nothing with nothing
Just promise so nothing will change
Your shit is nothing and nothing from nothing
There's nothing, the fuck do I have to explain?
Really don't nobody know you my nigga
I trust you as far as I throw you my nigga
We getting fucked, what you think?
You just a...fill in the blank
I don't be flexing
I don't be running 'round with these suckas that talk about nothing
Hoes be mad cause I ain't communicating
But I promise you I won't be texting
I am not really that big on the fashion
I be like "please get that hoe out my section"
I might just pull up on you with the Wesson
You ever see me you should know that's a blessing
This Coca and Creek man

Now I'm playing with the bag
Kill a nigga with the swag
