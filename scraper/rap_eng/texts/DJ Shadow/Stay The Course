From the first inhale, a child let out a cry
Some say cause we in hell ‘till we die
What if at death there's no sign of Muhammad, no sign of Isa
Just a pearly gate agent asking for your visa
We’re back on the third rock
People trying got keep ‘em head up, you heard pop?
And bad time trespasses on your premises
Good times avoid you like a nemesis
With or without, we all gonna face that
Find a way to put food upon the place mat
Stay sound, feet well hanging
'Cause trouble always imposin' with its bulldozin'
The majority will not see the few chosen
But we'll see our way through before curtain closing
Maneuverin' around, frowns keep the [?]
Out and in them four walls for all four seasons

Be the one, be the now, live forever in the style
Never stop, never rest, always know, never guess
Navigate through the North, East, South, to West
And just stay the course, you gotta stay the course
Keep the eye on your prise and your thoughts out the box
And your head in the sky, let the knife cut the pie
Take a piece, no matter East, North, South, to West
Just stay the course
We be talkin' that matter of fact, right and exact
Maintain, just stay on track
We be talkin' that matter of fact, right and exact
Maintain, just stay on track
We talkin' that matter of fact, right and exact
Maintain, just stay the course
We be talkin' that matter of fact, right and exact
'Cause if you don't, that's when you're lost

Stay the course, take a horse
Since I'm makin' my way across the high planes
Life a drifter, the stripper's takin' it off
The world's shittin' on me, instead of shakin' it off
I let it dry, brush it off, I'm never takin' a loss
From the start to the finish, my heart'll never diminish
Hit the stage, but I started in the park on the benches
I was singing for fences, when I sing it's such a blessing
They tweetin' for their redemption poem, bringing with the mentions
Bringin' different dimensions, you see that shit?
You say you’re making a movie but I’ve seen that flick
Kids stay in the picture, really complete the photo
Electric fire and electric lightin', like Vita Coco
Livin' la vida loca, my life is sort of like the tornado that took Toto
I watch you dance slow mo, then I shape it like Plato
I don’t mean the clay though, what I mean is my philosophy keepin' me real stable

[Chorus]
Be the one, be the now, live forever in the style
Never stop, never rest, always know, never guess
Navigate through the North, East, South, to West
And just stay the course, you gotta stay the course
Keep the eye on your prise and your thoughts out the box
And your head in the sky, let the knife cut the pie
Take a piece, no matter east, north, south, or west
Just stay the course
We be talkin' that matter of fact, right and exact
Maintain, just stay on track
We be talkin' that matter of fact, right and exact
Maintain, just stay on track
We talkin' that matter of fact, right and exact
Maintain, just stay the course
We be talkin' that matter of fact, right and exact
'Cause if you don't, that's when you're lost

Be the one, be the now, live forever in the style
Never stop, never rest, always know, never guess
Navigate through the North, East, South, to West
Just stay the course, you gotta stay the course
Keep an eye on the prize and your thoughts out the box
And your head in the sky, let your knife cut the pie
Take a piece, no matter East, North, South, or West
And just stay the course, stay the course
Be the first, not the last, get a hold, get a grasp
Of your soul, we're now never slow, profound
Keep it right, never wrong, write a poem, write a song
And just stay the course, stay the course
