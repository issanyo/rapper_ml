[Intro: Lyrics Born] + (Joyo Velarde)
Girl I got you good now...
You ain't goin' nowhere...
Hehehe
(Ooohhooohhhhoohh)
(Ooohhooohhhhoohh)
(Ooohhooohhhhoohh)
(Ooohhooohhhhoohh)
(oooohhh, oooohhh)
(aaaahhh, aaaahhh)

[Verse One: Lyrics Born]
Girl, I know that look when I see it
I know that I can make it work girl, believe it
There's big things 'bout to happen to you now, just release it
I'm like a hunter that searches for your finest weakness (Listen!)
Cause I take my time, and I bait the line
Then I creep like a lion, 'till the prey is mine
Can ya taste it?
They way I slip it and give it to you little by little
And minute by minute 'till it's mixed in your system like venomous liquid
It gets so addicted, you're feeling so twisted
You can't live without a hit of it... I'm so wicked
Live it

[Hook: Joyo Velarde]
Fiendin', schemin', stealin'
Losing it oveeeeeerrrr youuuu
I've been cryin', lyin'
Doin' it all fooooorrr youuuu
Schemin', pleadin', theivin'
Losing it oveeeeeerrrr youuuu
I do it over and over and over and over and over againnn
I do it over and over and over and over and over againnn

I don't, know who, I am, anymore, anymore, anymorrree
I don't, know who, I am, anymore, anymore, anymorrree

[Verse Two: Lyrics Born]
I'm flowin', through your veins
And I'm floatin', through your dreams
Holdin', like a leash
And I won't let, you release
I'm always, on your brain
In the mornin', you awake
'Till the moment, you're asleep
I'm holdin', all the strings
You're acting so beside yourself
You know your family don't even recognize you, girl
They can't believe you let me in your life
And you can't leave, you're so hypnotized
You do anything, say anything, prove anything, praise anything
Sell anything, give anything, steal anything, risk anything
Kill anything, bank anything, anything but the remedy for me
(dendendendendennn) (Wrap it up!)

Fiendin', schemin', stealin'
Losing it oveeeeeerrrr youuuu

I do it over and over and over and over and over againnn
I do it over and over and over and over and over againnn

I don't, know who, I am, anymore, anymore, anymorrree
I don't, know who, I am, anymore, anymore, anymorrree
I don't, know who, I am, anymore, anymore, anymorrree
I don't, know who, I am, anymore, anymore, anymorrree
