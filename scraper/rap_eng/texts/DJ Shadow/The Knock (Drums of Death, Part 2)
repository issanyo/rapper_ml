[Intro]
Yeah, come on
Come on, come on, come on
One time, come on, come on, come on, come on
Come on, come on, come on, come on, you don't stop
Yeah, one two, one two
(With the best MC in history)
Check me out
Yeah

[Verse 1]
Now I'ma break it down in the UNKLE style
Drums of death that are worth your while
In the file, I'll dial, I said
Anyone who says we're not versatile
'Cause it's me, M-I-K-E to the D
Getting down, U-N-K-L-E
For this, you pay a fee, it's not for free
Coming to the end of the century
Crossin' continental with these beats
And we can get asses jumpin' out your seats
The drop-top up with the Flintstone feets
â€˜Cause I wanna get you down with addictive treats
Hand me the mic and I will say
Living positive each and every day
Whether in the fall or the month of May
Lavelle be getting down with no delay
(Down with no delay)

[Interlude]
Yeah, drums of death, y'all
Puttin' it to the test, y'all
Never rest, y'all, yeah
Check it out

[Verse 2]
I got a little story to tell
With DJ Shadow and James Lavelle
It starts right now in history
And I am known as the rapper Mike D
Funky, funky beats, one-two, break it down
Deliver it on down with the a-one sound
Ounce by ounce and pound for pound
Got that shit that's out of bounds
The beat's on time and I hope you feel
Nice and complete like a happy meal
Sounds of tomorrow, can't y'all just steal?
Or is it too hectic for y'all to deal?
Gotta keep moving 'til we hit the top
My boys UNKLE gonna let the beat drop
Grab the mic and I start to mop
Like I done since day one in the game of hip hop

[Interlude]
Whew, that was hot, now dig this

[Instrumental Break]
Yeah, drums of death, y'all
Yeah, drums of death, y'all
Yeah, drums of
Yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah, drums of
Yeah, drums of death, y'all

[Outro]
Yeah, drums of death, you know what I'm sayin'?
Uh-uh, straight for moneymakin'
Moneymakin', oh, easy
