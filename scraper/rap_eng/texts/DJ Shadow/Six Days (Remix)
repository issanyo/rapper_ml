(DJ Shadow)
At the starting of the week
At summit talks you'll hear them speak
It's only Monday
Negotiations breaking down
See those leaders start to frown
It's sword and gun day

Tomorrow never comes until it's too late

(Come come come come come with it)(x2)

You could be sitting taking lunch
The news will hit you like a punch
It's only Tuesday(What time is it?)
You never thought we'd go to war
After all the things we saw
It's April Fools' day(What time is it?)

Tomorrow never comes until it's too late
Tomorrow never comes until it's too late

(Mos Def)
Tomorrow is another day
Today is another boom
Tomorrow is another day
Today is another…boom
Tomorrow is another day
Today is another boom
Tomorrow is another day
Today is another
(boom boom ba ba ba ba boom ba ba ba ba boom ba ba ba ba ba)(x4)

(Slow it down….)
SHOT!
Escalation
Never Station
Generation
Separation
Situation
Dissipation
Shot!
Another shot another shot the tender is to(?)
The heart is cold the gun is hot(Shot)
Im not sure if they feeling that
Im not sure if they wanna stop
The gun is cold the blood is hot(Shot)
(Sha Sha Sha Sha Sha Sha Shot)
The hearts are weak the guns are not

(DJ Shadow)
You hear a whistling overhead
Are you alive or are you dead?
It's only Thursday(What time is it?)
You feel the shaking on the ground
A million candles burn around
Is it your birthday?(What time is it?)

Tomorrow never comes until it's too late(Get tomorr' on the phone… Tryna be smart …Get tomorr' on the phone)
Tomorrow never comes until it's too late(I need to see tomorr '…Tryna reach tomorr')
Think tomorrows come I think it's too late

(Mos Def)
ANOTHER DAY!!!!!!!

Till the end
Boom boom ba ba ba ba boom ba ba ba ba boom ba ba ba ba ba

(Tomorrow is another day)(x2)

Bring it ON!
Bring it ON!
Bring it on cuz theres gon be shit tonight!
