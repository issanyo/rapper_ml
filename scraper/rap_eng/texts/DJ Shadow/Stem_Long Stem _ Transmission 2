Then go back and then decide, decide...

I come to play right down

I'll tell your children not to lay right down
I say parking tickets?! You're crazy! I don't...

He says well, they have some outstanding warrants left on you
And they want to just solve them you know, whatever it'll be
So they take me in on a chain to long beach
And now they lock me up in the cell
Behind the courtroom in Long Beach
While I'm awaiting to be heard
On my traffic offences parking tickets
And I panicked, I'm thinking, oh my God, man
While I'm here, you know, holding me
Actually what's to stop them?
I mean what's really to stop them?
Oh, I assumed that maybe some day
My mother would realize that I should have gotten out!
But ah, she was nice, she would have known
But still, what's to stop them?
And I'm panicking... And finally they called...Sorry
Oh my god...I am... Scared...
