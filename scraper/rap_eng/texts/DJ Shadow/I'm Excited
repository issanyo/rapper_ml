(I am excited) Got your ring, got your ring
Got your ring, got your ring, got your ring now
(I am excited) I just got my record done
And I don’t know what to say now
(I am excited) New days, new days
New album, new race (I am excited)

I am an alien from the ghetto, bitch, you can’t call me etto
But I keep you warming in the ???
You tell me specially like Michael Jordan
Ding ding ding that’s the sound of my alien rest
Got through climb glass, I only throw to show my face
And I hopelessly say

(I am excited) Got your ring, got your ring
Got your ring, got your ring, got your ring now
(I am excited) I just got my record done
And I don’t know what to say now
(I am excited) New days, new days
New album, new race (I am excited)
I am an alien, you have been in the ghetto
Different time, you can brand new day
I am an alien from the ghetto

So what escort ???
If you do, another you before is another one of you
I'm still, I'm ???
??? transition Michael Jackson .. lyrics, forget all ???
I only have to speak my mind, speak my mind
And I hopelessly say

(I am excited) Elevate, elevate your mind, elevate your mind
(I am excited) Hey, open your door
Do you really wanna travel free time?
(I am excited) Alien is not to pray, she's got my rest, got my rest
(I am excited) she's got my rest, got my rest
She's got my rest, got my rest, ah
I am an alien, you have been in the ghetto
Different time, you can brand new day
I am an alien from the ghetto
