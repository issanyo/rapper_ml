Shawn Phillips:
And why should we
Want to go back where we were, how many years?

Irene Kral:
All my life I felt
Content to stargaze at the skies
Now I only want to melt

Shawn Phillips:
And why should we
Want to live a life that's past and nevermore?

[Outro]
This is not a dream, not a dream
We are using your brain's electrical system as a receiver
We are unable to transmit through your conscious neural interference
You are receiving this broadcast as a dream
We are transmitting from the year 1-9

It is happening again...
It is happening again...
