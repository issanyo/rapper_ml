[Verse 1]
I swear I'll solve your life, my feet fall over you inside
And I thought I heard someone say
You'll fly far away
And when you reach up the sky is there

[Verse 2]
This clueless, I wouldn't know
We swam in the waves, and we let it go
Until I heard someone say
Over the horizon beyond
Oh, where you reached and knocked over stars

[Chorus]
I dreamt I came from parking movements
Every moment I see with our clothes
Take me to places where we can stop
I dreamt I came from parking movements

[Verse 3]
Ooo, Ooo
Nothing can steal this treasure from us, babe
I'm still in love, now
Fighting the sounds
Take chances and come closer to me babe
I'm fallin' out, now

[Chorus]
I dreamt I came from parking movements
Every moment I see with our clothes
Take me to places where we can stop
I dreamt I came from parking movements

[Outro]
Now, Oooooo
Take chances and come closer to me babe
I'm fallin' out
