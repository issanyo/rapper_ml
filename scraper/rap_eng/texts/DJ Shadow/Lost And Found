Well
Well
You know something that's what you've done
You said to me

Come
Come
Come
You said to me...
You said to me I'm outta my mind

Now, now, now
Now let me give you the picture of, of
Of what's going down

Now, now let me give you the picture of, of
Of what's going down

Now let, let, let, let me give you the picture of, of
Of what's going down

Now let, let me give you the picture of, of
Of what's going down

Now let, let, let-let
L-let, let, let, let-let
Let-let me give you the picture of, of
Of what's going down
What's going down

Wanted more for a letter
Want to go...
Seasons gone

Get high...
Get above yourself
Look down upon yourself
Until you're inside o' yourself
Look to the front or the back o' yourself

To the back or front of yourself
It's inside yourself
And then you see your own head
And know yourself is yourself

'Cause when you find yourself
You're gonna find that yourself is only yourself
And the self that can only be yourself
So when you're infront of the back of yourself
You're gonna find that your mind is in the centre of yourself
And God is nothing but yourself

And when you reach for yourself
You'll know that yourself
Is the only thing
That can happen to yourself
So that nothing can put you down

I said goodbye smoothly
I said goodbye smoothly
I said goodbye smoothly
I said goodbye smoothly
