[Verse 1]
You broke you can choke this smoke out
You living like a low you be toast in ghost town
Ghost town
Break break break break break you broke you can choke this Smoke out
Go go ghost town you living like a low you get toast
Ghost town
Ghost town
Break you broke you can choke this smoke out
You living like a low you be toast in ghost town
