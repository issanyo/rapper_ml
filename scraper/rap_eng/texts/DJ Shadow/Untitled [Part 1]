Outside my window
I can hear a radio
Playing my favourite song

He comes on every day
In such a groovy way
He's a funky DJ

He plays that funky music 'til the early morn
And the funky, funky DJ keeps rappin' on

Check it out

Funky, funky DJ, gettin' down, check it out
Funky, funky DJ, gettin' down, yeah, check it out

He plays that funky music 'til the early morn
And the funky, funky DJ keeps rappin' on

That funky DJ

Down to the/
Brothers startin' out early
And roundin' up their friends
He starts gettin' down at 8
By 9 you can't get in
When he spins his records
You wanna get on the floor
Don't worry when that record ends
Cos he's got plenty more

Nobody listens to tapes in cars
When he's on the radio
Nobody watches television
Cos he's got a better show

He's number 1, he's a turntable king
He's number 1, when he's doing his thing
He really gets down with it baby - uh!

Raise it sayin' about playin' this chord
Ain't even hittin' the B flat right
I'm a... (he's a turntable king)
Hit me just a little bit... (he's a turntable king)
If it's the last thing I do... (he's a turntable king)
When I come home you're gonna put your cold feet on it
(he's a turntable king)

Raise it...

I'm sportin' rings and things, that's what money brings
If you act like you know I'll put you under my wing
If you act otherwise, and try to demise me
Take me for granted, and try to surprise me
I'm out of dreg, I'll break your legs
Because you're yellow, just like the yolk of an egg
His name is Donnie D, and I'm the Master Rob
MCs rock my rhymes, like they was corn on the cob
I shoot a sudden K, from the white shit tip
Know what I'm sayin'? I'm not playin

Shoop! Shoop!

When you told me, I had the only key
That opened the door to your heart
When you told me, I had the only key
That opened the door to your heart

I'm a one woman man
And I'm gonna prove that I can
Be a father, a lover and a friend

Wahhhhhh! Three!
Three people in love!
That ain't right!
Sho' ain't right!

One two three
People in love
Somebody gonna fight
(I don't want that to be y'all)
Somebody sure gonna fight tonight
(I don't want that to be y'all)

If I feel like I do feel today, tomorrow
I would feel like I felt yesterday
And if I'd listened to the words you said, and followed
I'd still be where I was yesterday

Let me tell you life was simple
Lovin' was an easy thing
Seein' was believin', listen to the words I say
Think of yesterday
You're nowhere today

????? ready on the line, today
Same ones that you told me yesterday
Keep the faith, believe me and I'll see tomorrow
Promises are not all you gave to me

Let me tell you life was simple
Lovin' was an easy thing
Seein' was believin', listen to the words I say
Think of yesterday
You're nowhere today

Is it good enough for ya? No...
Is it good enough for ya? Almost...
Ahhhhh, you know it's good!


Uh la la la la la...
Oh can't you see?
I gotta be me
Ain't nobody just like this
I gotta be me
Baby, hit or miss

Much too late, it's goin' on y'all
It's too late, it's goin' on right now

We're about to do a thing called thang
Everybody gotta join in and do it
Momma can do it, pappa can do it
Great-grandfather can do it too
You too!

We doin' it, we know it
We got thang in our soul to show it
We doin' it, we know it
We got thang in our soul to show it

We know we doin' it
Cos we can find it, wherever it is
I'll tell you what you can do:

Put it on the ground
(We'll bring it on up)

Put it in the air
(We'll bring it down)

Put it in the river
(We'll drink the river dry)

Soul you can find, wherever you try to hide
We're doin' it

Down at the corner, they got a discoteque

Down at the corner, they got a discoteque, yeah
The chicks are groovy, and ???, yeah
When the band start smokin', they hop up on the floor
And do the hittest dance that you ever saw, oh
Ugh!

He wanders round every day
Lookin' for a place to stay
He stays out all night long
Cos he ain't got no home

He's the tramp from funky Broadway
Come from down on funky Broadway
He's the tramp from funky Broadway
Dirty dirty Broadway

It's Saturday night in LA and the strip is jumping
The groupies, Barbara, Dolly, and Jane, are making
The scene, looking for fun and games to make the
Night. But the trip they're about to take is going
To be a real bummer... in a...in in... a... bummer
