Now this happens to be... what they might call
Or what they might term a remix
A rethink, a rejiggle

So who's that...
I see many lights before me?
Many lights!

Dark shadows
Nice Unkles
And a Rooty-toot Manuva

Swell then!
A shizzle

More bass

Find me a space
Find me a space on, on the beat, yeah!

Round chemist, menace
Who that met off for this five whore
Totally soft
From jokey-jammin'
Now we plannin'
Now we mannin' that mission now
Rediss and dismantle, my spambo
Knockin' you down, come catch this sound
Heavy weight now, takin' you there
You made me take wow, wait now
Walk to the light, that baptism
Medicinal positionin'
Visit now we fishin' in my jin sin in acid
See my dick's never flacid
Tax machine
Leanin' and mean
Sweat 'til it hurts
Splurt my bambino
My Brian or my Eno
Oops-my-daisy,,
Can't see your face never faze me
Love for day my oxi
Sonny is he crazy?
Yes y'all, chicks in the bathroom
They hippy high heels with the lippy
Now we sick to the back tooth
Uncouth, corner the room
They'll cut root now
Sonic yarp youth
See the light, see the truth now

You little piece of dick brained, horse shit, slime sucking son of a whore!
You live with a cocksucking mynx, you scumbag, you low-lifed motherfucker!

Badder boy, ship ahoy
Ghosts how we do this
We fucked up, we tucked up
Leave me to thief police car
Ride don't know me
Won't you walk with me slowly?
Yes y'all, you don't got no time to be stood
One doosh, one toosh
Irrigation, colonic
My trance for you, 'tronic
We on it like a sonic
We done it 'cos we dance from long time
The prime
Porky walky
See the codes on my
My walkie talkie
(Breaker one nine, breaker ten to we stage)
True up to the faith
'cause it just can't be replaced
Put a poem on that dark place
See it from that dump state
Burn down that hate shootin'
Practiced in the state
With that snake, that I sting you
That statement stage will
'cause most of the time we keep it all for real now

Goddamn motherfuckin' son of a bitch...
