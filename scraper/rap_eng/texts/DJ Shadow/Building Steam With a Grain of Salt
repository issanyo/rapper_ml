[Intro]
Producing

[George Marsh]
From listening to records I just knew what to do, I mainly taught myself
And, you know, I did pretty well
Except there were a few mistakes
But um, that I made, uh, that I've just recently cleared up
And I'd like to just continue to be able to express myself
As best as I can with this instrument
And I feel like I have a lot of work to do
Still, I'm a student, of the drums
And I'm also a teacher of the drums too

[Interlude]
What makes cancer tenacious?
The moon rules the fluids
Including the inner juices of human beings
That which assimilates and feeds the body
So the crab feeds his astral plane
Assimilating and distributing all he receives
Slowly, until it becomes a part of you

[Break]
I fly to the strangest lands

[Outro: George Marsh]
And I would like to able to continue
To let what is inside of me
Which is, which comes from all the music that I hear
I would like for that to come out
And it's like, it's not really me that's coming
The music's coming through me
The music's coming through me
