I do what I do best, I take scores. You do what you do best, try to stop guys like me

You wanna be makin' moves on the street, have no attachments, allow nothing to be in your life that you cannot walk out on in 30 seconds flat if you spot the heat around the corner

Our problem is take the bank or split right now, do not go home, do not pack, nothing. 30 seconds flat from now we are gone on our separate ways, that's it (that's it, that's it, that's it)

M.O... is that they're good. Once it escalated into a murder 1 b. for all of 'em after they killed the first two guards, they didn't hesitate, pop guard number three because... what difference does it make (does it make, does it make, does it make)?

We want to hurt no one. We're here for the bank's money, not your money. Your money is insured by the federal government, you're not gonna lose a dime. Think of your families, don't risk your life. Don't try and be a hero

That's exactly what they're gonna do, they're gonna walk. This is my operation, I have tactical command that supersedes your rank, they will walk away and you will let them

Let. Go. Act. Do. Advance. Decide (decide, decide)

What happened out there?
Don't ask

You know, we're sittin' here... you and I are like a couple of regular fellas. You do what you do, and I do what I gotta do
And now that we've been face to face (face, face, face)...

I could just lay right down, I tell ya children I could lay right down

What if you do got me boxed in... and I gotta put you down? Cause no matter what, you will not get in my way. We've been face to face, yeah. But I will not hesitate. Not for a second

So it's all over then

You take it easy (take it easy, take it easy, take it easy)
