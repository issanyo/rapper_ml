Peep through the door
It seems as though the grass was much greener before
The dead life has been washed upon the sea shore
Money and greed deluded what is truly pure
And yet our flesh keeps screeching out for more

Now you're trapped
A hole in the ozone about to make the world collapse
Pollution fills the air and minds with bullet twisted facts
Midnight is now upon us people righteous laws are coming back

Don't turn your head away cause you can't get away
Your mind is lost because your spirit has been led astray
Don't ever say you gave it all if you ain't gave it all
Just fade it in the hazy purple twilight
No more time I tried to warn you all it's now approaching midnight

Panic's in the air
Some jumping out of buildings others on their knees in prayer
Some cry out to the sky and yell they aren't quite prepared
You looked god in the face and said forgive me all he did was stare

Now you can run
But where you gonna hide from all the power of the sun?
The cosmic repercussions of what human kind has done
No understanding of the fullness everything is simply one

Soon to be none again so that new life can come again
Illusions rule the mind your soul is never gonna end
So don't pretend you gave it all if you ain't gave it all
Just fade it in the hazy purple twilight
No more time I tried to warn you all it's now approaching midnight

So I bid farewell
No more good times or bad times, no more heaven no more hell
Now brace yourself for impact it's a half hour to twelve
Complete in total darkness empty space is where you're left to dwell

And all you had to do was live today for your tomorrow
But now it's over and you're drowning deep inside your sorrow
You could've led but instead you confirmed and chose to follow
So once again I bid farewell

There's only seconds left you'd like to second guess
But through your foolish ways you've literally beckoned death
So just don't say you gave it all if you ain't gave it all
Just fade it in the hazy purple twilight
No more time I tried to warn you all it's now approaching midnight
