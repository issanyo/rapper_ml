[Intro: Black Milk - The Kraft]
This is probably the most challenging record you have ever put
On your turntable
Its purpose is to challenge the performance potential of your stereo equipment

[Hook]
You could be as good as the best of them
But as bad as the worst
So don't test me
You better move over
You could be as good as the best of them
But as bad as the worst
So don't test me
You better move over

[Verse 1]
I'm still grooving, feel the vibration when I move in
Leave cats ruined through the doodling, schooling
These low class G's on how to cool it
Leave the coolest females drooling
You got to ball like pool and laugh at those who be losing
Dont talk to every chick cruising 'cause you know they be acusing
Tryna up my figs like newton, bars
Keep mines mines turn yours into ours
Shaky like a berry gordy contract
Very sporty shorty in the stone washed jeans, the best I've seen
Tighter than a fist trying to make a vein pop out
My punchlines bring the knockout
Stro flows cold like December 25th with the sock out
Brooklyns own, yall are just clones
Got to keep it real in the field of rap
I can't feel your tracks you could have that back

[Hook]
You could be as good as the best of them
But as bad as the worst
So don't test me
You better move over
You could be as good as the best of them
But as bad as the worst
So don't test me
You better move over

[Verse 2]
Realer than most, that be the motto homie simple and plain
Without a cheat code we still managed to live in this game
Life's a movie, my characters main
Never no extra
Making moves, crews check the motion detectors
Perfecting, ever since my poppas erection
Direction is up trying to get the top no smuts
It's enough of that back home, I'm on a new road
Trying to tell these haters kudos, 'cause you know
They use their power just to pull your card like UNO
Mad when you jamming and your tracks slamming like sumo
No wrestler, hustler, get the rest of your
Folks and check out this lyrical dope
Rap game, crack game same thing only difference is
It's no baggies, skinny jeans and saggies
I'm so nine 0, but Stro never add the two one o
I keeps it real, you better chill

[Hook]
You could be as good as the best of them
But as bad as the worst
So don't test me
You better move over
You could be as good as the best of them
But as bad as the worst
So don't test me
You better move over

[Verse 3]
What they be asking when I flip the tracks
They reacting like macs but I hacked em
Spitting just like a captain, it's deeper than rap
Don't mention us in the same sentence, I'm all caps
It's the mac daddy mac, oh my god don't trip
I mop 'em up with flows I kick their waiting for me to slip
Don't pass the microphone, unless your trying to set it off
Let it off, got to cure my ill with the lords doctor
Kick rocks like poor socker
Chart topper, living in hell I bet I leave hotter
Represent for the Brooklyn borough
Stro gets props on every block like matumbo
Killing by the bridge I caught a body in Dumbo
You can't verse my verses, I turn a rapping Mayweather humble
Don't put me in a box and recognize who be the ink king
Got more bars than sing sing
I flow def up until I hear the ching ching
Trying to get my piggy bank brolic
Get a grip your falling
Ahh, it's nothing they can tell us
Alright you're nice but don't get too overzealous
