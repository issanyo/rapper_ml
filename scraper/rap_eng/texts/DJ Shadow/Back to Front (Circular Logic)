[Intro:]
I'm back... I forgot my drum

(He throws his head back, opens his mouth, and takes a deep breath.)

[Chorus:]
One by one, one by one, one by two by one by two

One by one, one by one, one by two by one by two

One by one, one by one, one by two by one by two
One by one, one by one, one by two by one by two
One by one, one by one, one by two by one by two

[Outro:]
(Watch out for the horse!)
I am DJ Shadow

(Watch out for the horse!)

I am, I am
Watch out!

(I'm really sorry, if I've caught you at a bad time...)
Shut up and die!
