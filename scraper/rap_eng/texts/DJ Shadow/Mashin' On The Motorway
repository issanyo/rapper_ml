[Intro]
He just wanted us to call him "Captain Da"
He said, "You can call me Da-da"
Whatever that meant

[Interlude]
Out of gas, still burning
Hey there... who, me?
Just your friendly neighborhood speed demon

[Verse 1]
I'm out to NASCAR to fast car to the last car
'Til there ain't no cars left
Enough cars go by with enough dust flyin' around
To make you cry, back down, and choke half-near to death
I'm up here on your left

[Interlude]
Sorry about that

[Verse 2]
See, like you, I push the bucket
I like to burn big
Like you, I've gotta cut all the bullshit out of my life to live
So I tell them, "Move over, this road ain't big enough for you!"
I'm flying like Knight Rider, they're tryin' to keep up
With their grandma outside on the sidewalk, size
Maybe their steel belted radials expired, maybe they're tired
Maybe their odometer needs to be rewired, or something

[Interlude]
(Fucking asshole!)
My bad...
Can you believe some of the drivers they let out here on the road?

[Bridge]
See, when the whole thing slows down
You're gonna find that clown who's gonna give you your scene
With the chance to take it... now!

(Damn, what the fuck're you doing, motherfuckin' asshole?!)
Sorry!
(Get off my lane, you fucking fuck!)
Hey, I got yours right here, buddy!
Bite me!
(Dude, what the fuck is your problem?!)
(Maldito hijo de puta!) Well, get out the way, then!
Move!
I'll catch ya on the rebound!
(Goddamn, motherfucker, what the hell are you doin'?)

[Outro]
So much hostility...
Y'all just keep checking your rear windows
Maybe you'll catch me passing... mashin'
