I'm sad and I'm lonely, my heart it will break
My sweetheart loves another, Lord, I wish I was dead!
My cheeks once were red as the bloom on the rose
But now they are whiter than the lily that grows

Young ladies, take a warning, take a warning from me
Don't waste your affections on a young man so free
He'll hug you, he'll kiss you, he'll tell you more lies
Than the cross-ties on the railroad or the stars in the sky

I'm troubled, I'm troubled, I'm troubled in mind
If trouble don't kill me, I'll live a long time
