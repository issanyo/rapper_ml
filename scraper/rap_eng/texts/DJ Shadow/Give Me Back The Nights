Give me back the nights
Give me back the agony of my solitude
The nights I've spent alone
The million endless Solitary nights of my life
Give me back all the people I desired that never came
Give me back your love, the love which was never really given
And even the lessons that you gave there was the taking
For you surprise and loving someone more helpless than yourself
Give me back the nights

Give me back the agony of the years of lonely living
Give me back the thousand rejections of my love
Give me back the love which I deserved
Give me back the time, the lost time, and energy, and beauty of my youth
Wasted in the wind and spilled out in imitation
When nothing was coming
And the waiting, the waiting
Give me back the nights
When we should have lain together
Building a great temple of our love
Give me back the nights
The nights
The nights
The nights
The nights
The nights
The lone, cruel, endless, dead
Nights
