[Verse 1]
In the beginning, well
I didn't know
As time passed on
Still didn't know
I didn't know

[Chorus]
But this time
This time, I'm gonna try it my way
I'm gonna live life my way
This time
This time, I'm gonna try it my way
I'm gonna live life my way

[Verse 2]
Well, I didn't know
Just couldn't see
The memories of past failures
Like a shadow haunting me

[Chorus]
But this time
This time, I'm gonna try it my way
I'm gonna try it my way
Yeah, this time
This time, I'm gonna try it my way
I'm gonna live life my way

[Verse 3]
There was a dream
I wanted to come true
But dreams, you know
They need to be followed through

[Chorus]
That's why this time
This time, I'm gonna try it my way
I'm gonna try it my way
Yeah, this time
Oh, this time, I'm gonna try it my way
I'm gonna live life my way
