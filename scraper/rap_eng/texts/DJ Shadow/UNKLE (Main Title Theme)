Put aside the everyday world and come with us
Into the realm of imagination
The middle ground between light and shadow
U-N-K-L-E
...would've ordinarily unveiled themselves as a guarantee of anonymity
But could include among other notable figures....
DJ Shadow and James Lavelle
Keep on rockin, keep on rock...rock...rock...keep on rockin
Keep-keep-keep on rock...K-L-E...keep on....K-L-E
Keep on...L-E, L-E...rockin
U-N-K-L-E, U-N-K, U-N-K, U-N-K-K-L-L-E
It's the awesome eternal UNKLE word-word-word....word
Science fiction, science, science fiction, science fiction
Fiction, fiction, science, science fict- biobreaker
An adventure unlike anything on your planet **
Keep on, keep on, keep on, keep on, keep on, keep on, keep on
Keep keep on rockin
Keep keep in keep keep keep in keep keep on keep keep in keep on
Keep on keep keep keep on rockin
Keep on U keep on N keep on K keep on L keep on E
Keep on rockin E
U (U-N) N (L-L-L) K-L-E....
There were too many of us
We had access to too many, uh, too much money
Too much equipment, and little by little we went insane
Fiery the angels fell...burning with the fires of Orc
U-N-K-L-E, U-N-K, U-N-K, U-N-K-K-L-L-E
A ticket to nothingness...
UNKLE
