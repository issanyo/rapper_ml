[Verse 1: Already A Thief]
Picture this, I'm the newest shit
Put me on your list, never less
I be runnin' over there with the best
I'm a thief
Tryna catch me I'm too quick
I ain't scared, be prepared
I could punch you in the face knock you out
Don't you pout, don't be cryin'
I ain't tryin' to hurt you
Well not yet
I could kill you with my thumb, Break your neck
Man I'm really not afraid of nothing
Step off bitch
'Fore I push you in a corner and I kick you to the ground
Safe and sound
There won't be a single soul to hear you
When you scream
And I will not feel a thing when you swing
You're a wimp
You will get down on your knees, Suck my dick
Little prick
You're a stupid motherfucker
You are dead

[Verse 2: Already A Thief]
Okay I will admit I'm not the first to do this shit
I'm not the second neither
It was Run the Jewels and then Enwind
But make some room for me here
Cuz they save the best for last
And ain't nobody comin' behind me
So get runnin'
From behind to steal ya thunder, I'm comin'
I promise
I really am not afraid of nothing
You could try shoving me into a dungeon
It would never do shit to me
Are you sick of me?
I could never get enough of me
Cuz I am deep-ily in love with me
I put pen to my paper like salt goes with pepper
And I'm pouring salt right into open wounds
Youâ€™re a pussy
You can't even handle a little bitty burn
Don't be fussy

[Hook: Run The Jewels]

[Verse 3: Already A Thief]
Stupid bitch put a picture
Of your stupid duck face
Up on Insta
I will double tap on that ass
Get to fuckin' class little hoe
You're a joke
Careful don't choke (cough cough)
Alright now I'm finishing
Better be listening
Your face is glistening
From the sweat that is drippin' down
Are you nervous from the sound
That is playin' real loud
Call it music call it skill
Call it talent it is real
I don't fuck around
This is not a fuckin' drill
So you better get to cover now
Cuz I gotta gun you better run now
I'll give you a countdown to get away
5 4 3 2 1 yea
Live to Shoot another day
