[Erinn Anova] (Chorus)

Come along and reap
I need my song
We're climbin' over
Beneath the sea
March on
Time is almost gone
It's all in me
No maybe

[Gift Of Gab]
Here we go again
Slip into my conscience, come along an take in
A story bout a battle, in this corner, Satan
Cunning, baffling, and jumping into half the drink
And suddenly disasters and catastrophe
And acting unrationally
Reacting savagely
To passionately
Bask in everlasting like escapes from just what its creating
Jeopardizin' love
Look at all the people that you took advantage of
See your hypnotized
Rom be gone, take another cup
In consequences lurk
While the reaper got your shirt size
Nigga wake up
Times overdue for the birth of a power that the universe grew from

(Chorus 2X)

[Gift Of Gab]
You search for the answers outside
Refocus causin' time and time again, backslide
You've noticed times before the presence of that "I"
But never did submit to it and let it apply
Whatever be his will in this present life time
Or essence like mine
Know the blessings you might find
If you let your higher power inside
Emerge and apply to every single thing in your balance
You will truly find
Who you really are
Die and become reborn
When God is present in your life than you can come reap on
And ain't a storm that you can't weather
You got a purpose you was born to create
Destiny is waitin' for you
Arms open, take with ya
Knowledge bestowed by the great giver
Lakes, rivers
Mountains and steams
Now reality's the dream wraitha
No more searchin' for truth that was always wit' cha
It had to hit ya through the struggle and the turmoil
Ya soul was planted and it sprouted out above soil
And let the sun shine freely down
At times it looked like it wouldn't
But the plant came to flourish
Now it's standin' on solid ground

(Chorus 2X)

[Lateef]

Sun rises like water up in my eyes
I'm watchin' changing times but like a changing tide
Tryna to keep my head above the ed if I could be

[Lateef & Erinn Anova]

The sun rises like water up in my eyes
I'm watchin' changing times but like a changing tide
Tryna to keep my head up
Above the ed if I could be
Least
If I may

(Chorus 4X)
