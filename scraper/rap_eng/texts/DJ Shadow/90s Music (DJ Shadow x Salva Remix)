[Pre-Hook 1]
(I been missing what you)
Some old song I know
Won't get out of my head
Though the feelings gone
The love ain’t disappeared
Some old song I know
Won't get out of my head
Though the feelings gone
The love ain’t disappeared

[Hook 1]
I've been missing what you
I've been missing what you
I've been missing what you
I've been missing what you
I remember what you
I've been missing what you
I've been missing what you
I've been missing what you
I remember what you

[Verse]
I’d been driving round in my car
Rolled down the window beside ya
Blaring out loud of the broken speaker
(Love like, Love- Love- Love- Love- Love- Love-)
From that day we'd only be with one another
Gang hangs, bust the jams, meet my mother
There was nothing that could come between us
(But I've been missing what you)
Stones at my window, like Romeo
Shot by Cupid with a bow and arrow
Old school, make me drool, roses at my door
(But I've been missing what you)

[Hook 2]
I've been missing what you
I've been missing what you
I've been missing what you
I've been missing what you
I remember what you
I've been missing what you
I've been missing what you
I've been missing what you
(Music music music music)

[Pre-Hook 2]
Some old song I know
Won't get out of my head
Though the feelings gone
The love ain’t disappeared
(I've been missing what you)
Some old song I know
Won't get out of my head
Though the feelings gone
The love ain’t disappeared
(I've been missing what you)

[Outro]
Everyday be listening to (90's Music!)
