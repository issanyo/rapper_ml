Hello Lester
We're having a quieter time around here now
But we really wished you were up
Well, one thing is pretty hot up here too
And look where everywhere I go
I draw heat - period
You heard what the man said
Well it's really been a lot of fun being up here
This is the best vacation I've ever had
And I guess I'll leave Friday
I'll get there maybe Saturday
Not later than Sunday
Take care of yourself
I know you have been
And bye bye and see momma
Sincerely yours, Nobella Johnson
