Then go back
Head there
Decide

I took on way right down
I tell you children I can lay right down

I say parking tickets you're crazy, I don't
He says well, they have some outstanding warrants left on you
And they want to just solve them you know, whatever it'll be
So they take me in on a chain down to Long Beach
And now they lock me up in the cell
Behind the courtroom in Long Beach
While I'm awaiting to be heard
On my traffic offenses, parking tickets I panicked
I'm thinking, oh my God man while I'm here what's to stop them?
I mean what's really to stop them, oh, I assumed
That maybe some day my mother would realize
That I should have gotten out, yeah
She was nice, she would have known but still
What's to stop them? And finally they called
So, they called, oh, man scared
