(feat. Christina Carter)

I speak from the heart
I fear beginning
I must go
Broken and soaked
To the wider world returning
I'll never be sullen again
Something is wrong
I can't stop my thoughts
I tell myself to stop them

Stop, stop what you're doing
I guess I'd better face it

The thoughts are sabotaging me
Even though they are mine
It feels as if it is physical
Like being in a different world
Weirder
As if somehow things just are

Let's go ahead and get it over with

Don't be afraid
Can't you trust me
We all have thoughts
And we are together
We are together
I am your healing spirit
I am your healing spirit
I am your healing spirit

Healing spirit

There is a boy
Standing in a meadow
Looking out into the sky
And hundreds (and hundreds)
And hundreds (and hundreds)
And hundreds of butterflies
Lift off from around him
(Lift off from around him)
That's all I can remember
(Lift off from around him...)

Your mind
Due (?) bright morning
Dance with light
Send stars to the night

I am awake
I have a dream
I am living proof
I am living proof

What I have done
What I have done
What I have done

First steps
Through open fields
