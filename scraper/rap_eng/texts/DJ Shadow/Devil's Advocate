Now, may I say to you?
Friend there is nothing wrong with a beat
It's used in every type of song
Whether it's a march, a waltz, a polka, a tango

But rock and roll is a different type of thing
For it is a mixture and confusion of beats
That jangles the nerves

The impulsive beats of our bodies and the spirit
And the pure unprovoked music
Has been domesticated for a problem
Rock music must give birth to orgasm in revolution

The heavy rock music now in style
Motivates you and entirely gives you
A sexual feeling, a girl can be turned on
By the music, it releases her inhibitions

The beat of the drum has always been
A factor of fertility rights, the girl realizes
Her sexuality through the music
And through the beat

Sex, sex

But they said that there was something
That got to them more than the words of the songs
And that was the beat, the beat
Louder and faster, louder and faster, louder and faster

It hooks young people, hadden
It become a part of this generation
And there lives are ruined

We need to shake ourself of this filtly beat
Music and words that produces
Revolution sex and drugs

The same beat produces the same evil incarnations
Even if we tie the words Jesus saves to it
Let's have our vile and get rid of this trash

Smash thouse filthy records get rid of them
