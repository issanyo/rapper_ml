[Verse 1]
At the starting of the week
At summit talks you'll hear them speak
It's only Monday
Negotiations breaking down
See those leaders start to frown
It's sword and gun day

[Hook]
Tomorrow never comes until it's too late

[Verse 2]
You could be sitting taking lunch
The news will hit you like a punch
It's only Tuesday
You never thought we'd go to war
After all the things we saw
It's April Fools' day

[Hook]
Tomorrow never comes until it's too late
Tomorrow never comes until it's too late

[Verse 3]
You hear a whistling overhead
Are you alive or are you dead?
It's only Thursday
You feel a shaking on the ground
A billion candles burn around
Is it your birthday?

[Hook]
Tomorrow never comes until it's too late
Tomorrow never comes until it's too late
Make tomorrow come, I think it's too late
