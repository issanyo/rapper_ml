Dear Lester
I'm sorry I didn't write before
And because this record wasn't sent
Which I intended doing before this
Everything went wrong

Tonight, we got together and kept the kids up
And decided to have a little fun making this record

Well of course, coming up
We didn't have a lot of trouble, we had a lot of fun
Momma slept all the way, and I didn't get tired driving
Was over anxious. We got in about 12:45
Got to Richmond, woke the family up
And there are so many things I could say
I just can't get them together...
I'll let you hear from somebody else
