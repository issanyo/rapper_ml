[Hook]
God knows you're lonely souls
God knows you're lonely souls
God knows you're lonely souls
Yeah, yeah

[Verse 2]
I believe there's a time and a place
To let your mind drift and get out of this place
I believe there's a day and a place
That we will go to and I know you wanna share
There's no secret to living
(There's no secret to living)
Just keep on walking
There's no secret to dying
(There's no secret to dying)
Just keep on flying

[Chorus]
I'm gonna die
In a place that don't know my name
I'm gonna die
In a space that don't hold my fame

[Hook]
God knows you're lonely souls
God knows you're lonely souls

[Verse 2]
I believe there's a time
When the cord of life should be cut, my friends
(Cut the cord, my friend)
I believe there's a time
When the cord can be cut and this vision ends
(Let this vision end)
But I'm gonna die
In a place that don't know my name
And I'm gonna cry
In a space that don't hold my name

[Interlude]
(Walking in the cold)
Just keep on flying
(There'll be a searchlight on the mountain high)

[Hook]
God knows you're lonely souls
God knows you're lonely souls
God knows you're lonely souls
God knows you're lonely souls
Yeah
Yeah
Yeah
Yeah
Yeah
Yeah

[Interlude]
I'm a lonely soul
(I'm gonna die in a place that don't know my name)
(I'm gonna die in a place that don't know my name)
God knows you are lonely souls
Lonely souls
Lonely souls
Lonely soul
I'm a lonely soul

[Bridge]
So long, little chapel
Sweet is the sound
Pack up your light
Pack up your light
Say goodbye to the Holy water life
Sweet sound, in and out
Pushing it out
Pushing it in
