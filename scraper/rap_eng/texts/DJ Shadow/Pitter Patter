[Chorus]
I hear all your raindrops falling this time
But they don’t come with everything teardrops on the line
[?] everything’s [?]
Why [?] don’t we ever know
But you still live inside
I hear all your raindrops falling this time
But they don’t come with everything teardrops on the line
[?] everything’s [?]
Why [?] don’t we ever know
But you still live inside
