[Verse 1]
They say if you took it all away
This love would fall apart
I say, no way
You don't know the size of my heart
Vicious, suspicious
It doesn't matter what I say
Users and losers
There's nothing here to make me stay

[Chorus]
Bloodstain on a blue vein
Take it with no shame
Love tracks on a loose train
Bloodstain

[Verse 2]
No gain with no pain
My scars are deeper than you think
Tie me, try me
One more time before I sink
Big lies, big times
This love is not what we're about
It's too late, and I'm too straight
It's time to blow this fire out

[Chorus]
Bloodstain on a blue vein
Take it with no shame
Love tracks on a loose train
Bloodstain on a blue vein

[Bridge]
Take me softly
I'm going crazy for your touch

[Chorus]
Bloodstain on a blue vein
(Blue blood, blue blood, blue blood)
Take it with no shame
(No take, no take, no take)

[Outro]
I'm alone and dissatisfied
And someone else is alone
And dissatisfied, too

You are alone?
