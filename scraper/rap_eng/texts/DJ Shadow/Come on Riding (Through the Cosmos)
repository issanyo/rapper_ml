[Intro - Laurie Anderson sample]
"Well, I know who you are, baby
You're the snake charmer baby
But you're also... the snake."

[Verse 1]
Though its true I'm living with
A travelling heart
And it was yours you knew from the very start
And I have come to know your eyes
When they're hiding

Though its true I'm living with
A travelling heart
And it was yours you knew from the very start
And I have come to know your eyes
When they're hiding
Lost in the time that slowly cries

[Chorus]
Come on riding!
Come on riding
Come on riding!
Come on riding

[Verse 2]
I have come to know your eyes
When they're hiding
I have come to know your eyes
When they're hiding
Lost in the time that slowly cries

[Chorus]
Come on riding!
Come on riding
Come on riding!
Come on riding

Come on riding!
Come on riding
Come on riding!
Come on riding
