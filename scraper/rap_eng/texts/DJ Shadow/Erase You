She was buried for a long time, disappeared into the night
She had a voodoo smile and a devil inside
So she's been down to the fog spitting words out like grenades
They got devils inside that explode in your face

You gotta be so careful, don't talk in your sleep
You gotta be so careful, the souls see

He was quiet for a long time, he never would sleep at night
He knew every little shortcut, he did everything right

Trying to be so careful, so he wouldn't speak
Trying to be so careful to hide his disease

(Under the blood red sky, under the blood red)
(Under the blood red sky, under the blood red)
Erase you (Under the blood red sky, under the blood red)
(Under the blood red sky, under the blood red)
Erase you (Under the blood red sky, under the blood red)
(Under the blood red sky, under the blood red)
Erase you (Under the blood red sky, under the blood red)
(Under the blood red sky, under the blood red)
Erase you (Under the blood red sky, under the blood red)
(Under the blood red sky, under the blood red)
A million serpants entering, ahh
(Under the blood red sky, under the blood red)
(Under the blood red sky, under the blood red)
They've broken free 'cause it's feeding time
(Under the blood red sky, under the blood red)
(Under the blood red sky, under the blood red)
And they're sharpening their teeth

I can't hear the noise when it gets too much
When it gets too much you can't hear the noise
I can't hear the noise when it gets too much
When it gets too much you can't hear the noise
(Erase you) I can't hear the noise when it gets too much
When it gets too much you can't hear the noise
(Erase you) I can't hear the noise when it gets too much
When it gets too much you can't hear the noise
(Erase you) I can't hear the noise when it gets too much
When it gets too much you can't hear the noise
(Erase you) I can't hear the noise when it gets too much
When it gets too much you can't hear the noise
