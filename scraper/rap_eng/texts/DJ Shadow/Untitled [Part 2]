Don't wanna signify, but the groundhall is always
Gonna be a mailman! (?)

To see the risin' sun

And I got some...satisfaction, woo!

To take with me on this trip
Now, this ride is gonna blow your mind
Cos the places we hang are gonna be so hip!

Who are really deep down into what's happenin'
Get inside the GVE and let me take you
Soul travelling!

Fasten your seatbelt baby, beacause

This is the joint Michigan
That funky place that they call the motor city
You know I've got a beautiful friend from here
He's a talented dude, I know you'll dig him

Hey klutz, don't come in here slammin' doors
And knockin' down chairs, I know you've been
Out all night, you look like...

Seems to me you've caught something, standing
Against the door jam and trying to scratch...
You want me to help you, huh? Don't jive me
Baby, you ain't doin' the scratchin' round
This that door jam, you tryin' to scratch that
What you want me to call it...

Come on baby!

What you want me to do? Come here for what?

Just keep on scratchin' here

Scratch? Scratch what? What's wrong with ya?

W... suspense beyond words!
Who is W?
What is W?
Where is W?

When will W strike again?

Like a sound you hear that lingers in your ear
But you can't forget from sundown to sunset now
It's all in the air you hear it everywhere
No matter what you do, it's gonna grab hold on you

California, San Fransisco, California, San Fransisco
California, San Fransisco
California soul
California soul

Where is W?

From this day on I'll dry your tears
From this day on I'll end your fears, yes I will
Cos a love like yours
Comes once in a million years
And I'll take care of you
From this day on
