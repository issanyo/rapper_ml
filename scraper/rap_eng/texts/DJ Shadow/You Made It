Stay close
The water is rising
Silent cries
The shadows surround us

So we crawl out from under
The water
Out of darkness

We're almost home, no sleep, don't girl

Look around
Don't stare into the light too long
There's nothing here to see, nothing here to see, nothing here to see
Frozen hands on the window
Crying out in your sleep
Look away now
Look away now

I never said that you were falling to pieces
I know the thought that we would never get out of this

Now the time that falls into the cracks
There's nothing here to see, nothing here to see, they never will be

So we crawl out from under
The water

I never said that you were falling to pieces
I know the thought that we would never get out of this...

And we crawl out from under
The water
Out of darkness
