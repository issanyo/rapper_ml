Look Bitch
Ya know I'm coming tight
So you can switch them hips from left to right all night and won't nobody give a shit
If you was sittin'
I might ask you ta stand, take a load off of ya mind cuz them lyrics you kicked was so butt
Ya brain must be synonymous with your behind
The timing on ya rhymin' sucked black
That's why I still caint figure out why the fuck
He was all on my nut sac
And droolin' on the tool and who ya foolin' tryin' ta act so cool
When it comes to the duelin'
Pull up a stool and we can begin the schoolin:
Ooohin' and Aaaahin' it
Really don't matter as long as the rappers know
Who's shit is fatter
And who should be beggin' the pardon
For the disaster
As I blast ya into Anti matter
Make you scream out Uncle! as I punk you with the funk
Watch you buckle like a punk will
Another chump killed as I chuckle pumping steel, through the steel, so that I can steal the show
The bunk have no appeal
Meaning that I don't feel the wack, even when you be feeling that
No matter how slow
Ya go
Ya still got no thing to say
When skills are softer than clay ? now come on man, that ain't where the Cassius
You must have thought that sexy ass was gone make some dough
On the strength of them promo pictures- Ho
Blow me down
I'd be surprised if you could even go just one more round
And I'm from the O
Challenging you in your own Goddamned town
And I know the homies gone clown
When they hear the
Profound thoughts and experiences applied from my strife to the end of your life on this mic
The Pipe is like enlightening when frightening
Reciting passages striken 'em all like lightening
From the hand of God
Writing missing your hand it might be odd at first
Awful uncomfortable but the fractured skull has gotta be worse
Curse the killer while the life giver is giving untill it hurts
Perkin' and buildin at work, blurtin' out warning! Alert!
Don't be decieved as to the multiplicities of realities available
Here on this earth since birth
Don't forget the royalties and legalities
Even though I don't think they were meant to be
Purchased on purpose
And maybe we're supposed to see grass first and then miss it
Excuse me ya'll
Sometimes my tense it gets terse
Cuz shit it pisses me off
Like niggas fallin' off did Coerced!
And oh! the shit is so perverse
And I didn't wanna be bothered with you or your smirk in the first
And it's probably best for everybody
Involved including the verse of course
If we all just word to thought
Cut short
