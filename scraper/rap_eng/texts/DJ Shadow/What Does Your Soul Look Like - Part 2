We are standing here at the edge of time... Cold...
Our road was paved to the edge of time... Steel... Sparks...
Come with me now to the edge of time...
Does anyone remember who I am?
In a few moments you will have an experience
Which will seem completely real...
It will be the result of your subconscious fears
Transformed to your conscious awareness...
You have five seconds to terminate this tape...
Five, four, three, two, one
Has everybody got a place to hide? Is everybody inside?
Has everybody got a place to hide? Is everybody inside?
There's a game out there, and the stakes are high
And the guy who runs it figures
The averages all day long, and all night...
Once in a while he let's you steal a pot
But if you stay in the game long enough, you've got to lose
And once you've lost, there's no way back... No way at all...

The time has come...
Darkness! Darkness! Darkness! Darkness! Da-da-da-da-darkness!
The time has come, the time has come...

Can you feel this? What is that buzzing?
Are you now, or have you ever, moved slowly?
