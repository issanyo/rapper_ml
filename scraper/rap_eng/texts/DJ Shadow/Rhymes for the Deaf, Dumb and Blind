[Gift of Gab]
I got rhymes for the deaf dumb and blind
And a 20/20 eyesight; big mouth yappin
Crystal clear ear competition mere child's play
When I'm formin up, can't be guarded now, sendin y'all to the
Drawing board, I floored niggas with the skills
I'm sick and bored, of all the triggers and the steel
That you're cappin; why don't you give all that weak shit a rest
And start rappin - I'm puffin the buddha bless yes I'm packin
BOWLS, and spittin the rhymes on ?testabra?
Be like D'Wayne from _What's Happening_ talking about "Uh-uhh!"
Ya, can't defeat me, delete me, beat me, greet me
With a grin or, get your chin jaw and your neck broke
And then I'll rip off your arm and throw it in a stew --
Boy I'll make mincemeat of you, ? speed a few, wimps eat a few
Shirmps need a new, temp-orary mind-boggler, follow me, G
Niggerole, bigger flows, hover over small ones
Others flows will fall, come and get some
Runnin shit one rhyme AFTER the next
Master the flexology, follow me, take all of me
Fuck a beast, buck a beast, sucker please
Don't you know _Miuziweighs-a-freakin-ton_ like Chuck D's?
Psych! Thought I would contradict myself, didn't ya?
I'm gettin ya
I'm hittin ya ass with bass all in your face so taste the bit
In ya, bowls of Soul, get on a Train but I'm not Don Cornelius
Really it's not no gimmicky shit like chicken popcorn
Now new and meatier, shootin like a meteor
Beats fat and beatier, feed me your brain child
The strange style contains foul language
So tell you kids to go to sleep so the beat can enhance you ock
If you a rapper grab your mic broke cancel the Glock yo'
Ass is grass and I'm the lawnmower hey bonhead nigga
Put your rhyme in the towaway zone
Red's all I see like if my name was El Toro
On the land, smokin a reefer, underwater smokin a coral reef
I squash beef like a meat grinder
I'm the kind of chief rocker to seek and destroy boys
Oy, I'm all of that and a plate of chitlins
So won't you sit and listen to the way I flip the script
Like, a pizza-maker flips a pizza, breakin shit
Delete you makin hits complete awaken kids I eat ya
Like a batch of bacon bits takin it to the next step
LET'S GET ILL
