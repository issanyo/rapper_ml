[Verse 1]
Does it mean I never let you know?
Each time I turn inside
When I fully grow, I'll outsize you
But I won't let you fall in love
You know it flows over me
And you won't let me drown inside

[Hook]
Sing a nursery rhyme to keep me quiet
Sing a nursery rhyme to keep me quiet
Woman, please stay close to me, close to me
Carried through your ecstasy

[Verse 2]
You can't stop me breathing
Even when you're on fire
Know that you're weaving
With my emotional wires
Flows through me, in through me, out through me
Over me, feeling me, feeding me electrically

[Chorus]
It's electric ballroom love
It's electric ballroom love
It's electric ballroom love
It's electric ballroom love
It's electric ballroom love
It's electric ballroom love
It's electric ballroom love

[Verse 3]
I have to breathe the air you breathe
I'm inside you
In a room inside a room, I'm inside you
The colour changes follow your emotion
I can see when you're feeling desire
I feel him close to you
While I just walk around inside you
Don't let him close to me
Not when you know it's not the one
The one that you love

[Chorus]
It's electric ballroom love
It's electric ballroom love
It's electric ballroom love
It's electric ballroom love
It's electric ballroom love
It's electric ballroom love
It's electric ballroom love
Keep me quiet

[Bridge]
Won't you sing me a nursery rhyme
To keep me quiet while you're on fire
Won't you sing me a nursery rhyme
To keep me quiet while you're on fire
Won't you sing me a nursery rhyme
To keep me quiet while you're on fire
Please just sing me a nursery rhyme
To keep me quiet, while I'm inside
Please just sing me a nursery rhyme
To keep me quiet, while I'm inside
I won't let you fall in love
You know inside, the baby knows
I won't let you fall in love
You know inside, the baby knows
I won't let you fall in love
You know inside, the baby knows
I won't let you fall in love
You know inside, the baby knows
Your baby knows
Your baby knows
Your baby knows
Your baby knows
You're on fire, you're on fire
Keep me quiet, keep me angry
