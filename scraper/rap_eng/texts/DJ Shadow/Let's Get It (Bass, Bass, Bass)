[Spoken intro]
If you're ready... I'm ready
It goes something like this:

[Chorus]
Let's get it!
Let's get it!
Get it! Get it!
Let's get it! Get it!
Let's get it! Get it!
Let's get it! Get it!
Let's get it! Get it! Get it! Get it!
Get it! Get it! Get it! Get it!
Get it! Get it! Get it! Get it!
Get it! Get it! Get it! Get it!
Ge-!
Ge-!
Ge-!
Ge-!

Let's get it!
Let's get it!
Get it! Get it!
Let's get it! Get it!
Let's get it! Get it!
Let's get it! Get it!
Let's get it! Get it! Get it! Get it!
Get it! Get it! Get it! Get it!
(Get it! Get it! Get it! Get it!) Bass-bass! Bass-bass! Bass-bass! Bass-bass!)
(Get it! Get it! Get it! Get it!) Bass-bass! Bass-bass! Bass-bass! Bass-bass!

[Bridge]
Ge-!
If you front on me you might get hurt
I like pushing bitches to the dirt
Ge-!
14th Street gangsters
86 that, bitch!

Bass-bass! Bass-bass! Bass-bass! Bass-bass!

[Singing in a different language, two lines, female vocal.]

[Chorus]
Let's get it!
Let's get it!
Get it! Get it!
Let's get it! Get it!
Let's get it! Get it!
Let's get it! Get it!
Let's get it! Get it! Get it! Get it!
Get it! Get it! Get it! Get it!
(Get it! Get it! Get it! Get it!) Bass-bass! Bass-bass! Bass-bass! Bass-bass!)
(Get it! Get it! Get it! Get it!) Bass-bass! Bass-bass! Bass-bass! Bass-bass!
