Come inside my mind there is something you should see
Pick up the telephone and hear my distant plea
If I start dancing, you can join me with your soul
I want to you feel you near, don't leave me on my own
Closer, closer. Get closer next to me. (Get a bit closer, babe.)
Closer, closer. Get closer, come closer so I can see ...
Hey, Mr. Shadow, won't you break this down ? (uh huh)
I'm dirty chasin and take this sound
That scratch is making me itch and I can't slow down
Shadow! Switch it up, and rearrange it briefly for us, please
Yah! You know what time it is. We 'bout to crank this thang
It's Fresh! We 'bout to tear this thing down
Uh uh uh x4
Bounce bou uh uh uh x6
Bounce... Hey, Mr. Shadow, won't you brace this down
We 'bout to tear this thing down, down, down
Down, down down. Down, down, down...
Tear, tear this up right!
Switch it up! Switch it up!
We 'bout to tear this thing down!
Slow down... Shadow, switch it up, rearrange it briefly for us, please
*Turn-table scratching "It's Fresh, fra, fra, Fresh, fre, Fresh."*
Everything goin' to slow mow
Fra, fra, Fresh, fre, Fresh, fra, fra, Fresh, fre, Fresh
Everything goin' to slow mow
Fra, fra, Fresh, fre, Fresh
Never closer, then I've ever felt to you
Did I ever caught your eye
Stand a bit closer then you ever stood before
I'm your moon and you're my sky
Closer, closer. Get closer next to me. (Get a bit closer, babe)
Closer, closer. Get closer, come closer so I can see
Can't you see, my head is spinning round and round, we're underground
Let's fly away, spend night and day just wasting time
If you don't mind
Closer, closer. Get closer next to me (Get a bit closer, babe)
Closer, get closer, come closer so I can see
