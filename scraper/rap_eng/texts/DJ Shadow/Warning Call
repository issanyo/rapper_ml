This is the greatest thing
You're ever likely to achieve in your life
Holding up the medals, you've won
While everyone else is swimming in circles
Working out, what happened to, everything you learnt in school
You don't remember them telling you that it's cool to be you

It's cool to be you when you like what you do
And you're strong, head strong, I'm saying, just saying
This is a warning call, a warning call

I wanna go home, I've said too much and I've set it up
It breathed all on it's own, it's own
There's nothing more to be done, so pack up your shelves of bitterness
There's a time for heroes and it's not now, it's not now

It is the greatest thing
You're ever likely to achieve (not, not, not...)
It is the greatest thing
You're ever likely to achieve (now, now, now...)

I know how to find out everything about you
I know how to find out everything about you

Well it's cool to be you when you like what you do
And you're strong, head strong, I'm saying, just saying
This is a warning call, a warning call
A warning call, a warning call
A warning call, a warning call
