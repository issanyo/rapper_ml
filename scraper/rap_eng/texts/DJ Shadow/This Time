In the beginning, well, I didn't know
As time passed on still didn't know
I didn't know

But this time, this time
I'm gonna try it my way
I'm gonna live life my way
This time, this time
I'm gonna try it my way
I'm gonna live life my way

Well, I didn't know, just couldn't see
The memories of past failures
Like a shadow haunting me

But this time, this time
I'm gonna try it my way
I'm gonna try it my way
Yeah this time, this time
I'm gonna try it my way
I'm gonna live life my way

There was a dream
I wanted to come true
But dreams
You know they need to be followed through

That's why this time, this time
I'm gonna try it my way
I'm gonna try it my way
Yeah this time, oh, this time
I'm gonna try it my way
I'm gonna live life my way
