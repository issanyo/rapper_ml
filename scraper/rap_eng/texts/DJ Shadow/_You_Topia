(Verse 1)

Its time to take a perfect trip
Were they not gon hurt the kids
Pray to stay curtain prince
Hate is just an urban myth where rumor will not surface quick
Thieves won't steal a purse they give where I never learned to quit
Where I feel the curse was lift hobos aren't cover in dirt spit
Real rap fastly immerses big we don't have no worthless pick
Money ain't why the world would spin laws written in this cursive script
A promise is for certain won't get judged wearing a turban burning won't leave you u hurting a dollars not what its worth to live
Where there's no such thing as death and pain
Hitler won't the next to reign we all won't playing separate games
Everything was off ya chest and u never had to check ya mate
Literally would levitate to better place wht we live is like a mess today
Chill out and put them tecs away are problems all were yesterday
But he had higher pressure gauge so he took my homies breath away
All the villains excavate hunting in the treasure chase
Stand inside a debtors way things surely gonna escalate

(Hook)

Tryina live a dream x 5
Mind spittin steam x5

(Verse 2)

They said that we can handle it left us just to rot in pain
And ever since the change I feel I just was not the same
But the pressure got my frame change the picture from a lion to some leopard spots and stains will we eva top the game can we eva stop the strain can't just let em watch us raise
Cause the demons in the shadows all just want the fame
So I press on the play watch the text off stage because i need a script to be the next pawned slave

They won't ever notice us they won't ever cobra touch bogus stuff we loathing bruh they won't eva show they buck they just won't bestow us trust the just won't bestow us love love pops off this is like the soda love welcome to Youtopia welcome Youtopia
