(Sample - "The Man Who Couldn't Cry" by "Loudon Wainwright III")
He cried, he cried, an' he cried, and he cried
Rained 40 nights
Played lots of chess
And he made lots of friends
He cried, he cried, an' he cried, and he cried
And he made lots of friends
And he wept every time it would rain
Well once it rained...

Latitude... Zero...
