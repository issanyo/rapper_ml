Are you ready for the...

Rap music
Aggressive assassination
Guns, drugs, violence, sex
Is that all rap is about?

The moon rises
Upon funky city
But wait a minute, out of the darkness!
A tall figure appears
Who is he?

Tell 'em who the fuck I am
The one, the only
DJ Shadow
Tell 'em who the fuck I am
I want you to meet the baddest motherfucker in town
Tell 'em who the fuck I am
The producing genius of
DJ Shadow

They've made such insignificant changes
To the sound recording
That it is still improvement
As far as we're concerned
And they have violated our school supplies of sound recording

They did what... the kids call "Sampling"

In the middle of the stable
With a turntable

Spin it like that

Spin it like that

Spinnin' on the turntables back to back
Back to back
Spinnin' on the turntables back to back
Back to back
Spinnin' on the turntables back to back
Back to back

The sound that nobody took seriously
Is now a power to be reckoned with

Now I don't even consider this art
He's rapping not singing for one
- But, but, that's your opinion
Well, it's rap, isn't it called rap?

Rap is definitely large, so
Rap is definitely the biggest form of music, right now
Because if it wasn't um... anybody wouldn't be using it
R&B, Rock, whatever
The rappin' is something...
It's always a rapper
The cartoon commercials
S'it matter, They got fat sis' don and donnie with fat chains on
You know, with the commercials, with the turntables
So now everybody wants to rap now
Why'know what I'm saying?

First it was like "Ok, it wasn't gonna last" back in 1979
It wasn't gonna last
But now it's '92, and we're still kickin' it

In the middle of the stable
With a turntable

The sound that nobody took seriously
Is now a power to be reckoned with

In the middle of the stable
With a turntable
