[Intro]

Ayo, kick that gangsta shit, c'mon
You got to kick that gangsta shit, c'mon
You got to kick that gangsta shit, c'mon
You got to kick that gangsta shit
What, what, what, what

Fingers in the flavor

(Count and estimate about a thousand dead)

[Verse 1: Gift of Gab]

It's funny here my burners are burners like incense
My new to this, true to this, but writing with pen since
I was a sperm cell, I hope you learn well
That the cream of rap is rising, other rappers burning well
Burn in helllafied flurries of syllables, juries was finding me guilty of killing emcees
So after I enter ya, know I'ma injure ya, rolling like a mass of villainous Gs
G-I-F-T, see I left the, suckers in confusion 'cuz I'm strong like Hefty
Bags or the fags and the hags, I'ma drag 'til the pig get to whipping til you wave the white flag
Dag nabbit, who framed Roger?
And sample more bounce 'til I'm played like a Dodgers' home game
From here to Rome sing, whole thang, I be hearing all the vinyl and it makes me moan "Dang"
Come get a slice of this, so rap's on the tight shit
Fight, get sent for words when I get my pipe lit
I pick up the bass like litter on my lawn
Your girl plays a hooker role, hit her and I'm gone
In a hurry, bury, any thought you ever had
Of slaying the Gift of Gab, I be making them jump like the mack dab
Calculate the sum, or add it up in your head
But uh, (Count and estimate about a thousand dead)

(Count and estimate about a thousand dead)
(Count and estimate about a thousand dead)
(Count and estimate about a thousand dead)
(Count and estimate about a thousand dead)
(Count and estimate about a thousand dead)

(About 100 or more)
(Fuck that, you and your bullshit crew)
(Fuck that)
(About 100 or more)
(Fuck that, you and your bullshit crew)
(Fuck that)
(About 100 or more)
(Fuck that, you and your bullshit crew)
(Fuck that)
(About 100 or more)
(Fuck that, bullseye, dead)

[Outro: Gift of Gab]
Yo, yeah, it's like this y'all
Solesides in the house
Blackalicious, DJ Shadow, Asia Born
And we hitting you with stuff you ain't never expected from the left
To all the suckers get rejected
And we out

(This was a goddamn slaughter)
(This was a goddamn slaughter)
(This was a goddamn slaughter)
(This was a goddamn slaughter)
(Goddamn slaughter)

(Next thing you know you're being buried and planted)
