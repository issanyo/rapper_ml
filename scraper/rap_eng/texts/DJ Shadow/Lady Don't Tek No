[Verse 1 - Lateef]
Lady don't take no shit insist on respect
Insist to walk around like a woman
She won't speak less it's something worth sayin
Don't play, the girl take herself so seriously
People stare curiously
She got a natural way, her hips sway furiously, yet luxuriously
Carries herself like the cutest most purdiest
Thing you've seen, this side of the bay
Go about her business so purpose-fully
She got razor sharp wit and she just won't quit
Flauntin it, body built like a house made outta bricks
She got the smile, the style and finesse
And bounded with the blessed and profound intellect
Select few have ever seen her butt naked
And they too wanna see the rep protected, cause...

She don't like violence
But she can throw them things so don't let your guard down
Her thighs are soft but her eyes hard
You can't just try tell her c'mon now
She digs Angela Davis
Alice Walker, Nikki Giovanni, o honey
Say she wanna be a doctor
And I'm sure someday, she gonna be treatin somebody
School to street smarts, girl ain't no dummy one
He can not make it back while then it ain't about the money
The boys and guys both start act funny whenever the queen's coming around the town yeah

[Bridge - Lateef and Lyrics Born]
Sweet top, London, Rome, outta sight, outta mind with the freaky shh
That she can't quite see, but she can't quite know
And it lies in the gentle, come better than that

[Verse 2 - Lyrics Born]
Wherever you took my head baby send it home, send it on home
I really think I lost my head cause this female's on [a whole new drug]
All the clerks wanna offer your help, all the folks compliment your style
Little children wanna jump in your lap, girl I wanna do that myself
She ain't no innocent Hello Kitty gem, she's commited sins, and ain't finished yet
But, because of her dis-po-sit-ion, she ain't subject to cri-ti-ci-zm
That's why the other women started mimicking
She ain't tripping off no images
Her interests are all limitless, she ain't limited by inhibitions lord
Boundless imagination, she wants this idea off me jack
That had me out in space, somewhere just floatin not knowing the way back
You know how I can't always fathom everything that you're saying bout have the time
When I hear your voice you support your boys
But all of that body language girl it's alright

[Outro - Lateef and Lyrics Born]
It's alright, it's alright now, I look right in your eyes and ask
How'd you get so deep (how'd you get so deep)
And just when I think I know your style, I notice some I ain't been
Don't give me no silent treatment girl
We tried to sing your name in latin baby (I'm gonna prove to you baby girl that I care about you)
Ain't that my obligation, no no no
('Cause I see something subtly rare about you
Certain savoir faire in the air about you)
