Question all your smiles because
Question all you got in a knot
And do that trick
And fuck off

Question all the pipes split off
Question all you pant alone?
And do that trick
And fuck off

What if I see you?
What if I see you?
What if I see you?

Question all your smiles because
Watching all you fans alot
See all that you've become
Do they recall
And you do it for us
And you do it for all the simple chords
