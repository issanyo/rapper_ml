It's a song about life, death, love, hate, wealth, poverty, racism...
Just a few things been running through my head...
Listen... We call on you... Listen... Now, we call on you...
Be strong... Hear us now!...

When you speak of overthrowing those conditions
I think this is what frightens people from the freedom of...
The average American, when you simply say the word overthrow
May see this as something very, very bad...
I know you're not responsible for his feelings
But, when you say these things, are you threatening someone?
Right now... People's power, People's power... People's... power
Detroit in '42... New York in '64...
Blinding by a hundred watts... The naked, black, white truth...
Destroy the establishment
Tear down the face of stupidity and corruption
And put up in it's place, an edifice of truth...
Unite in struggle for people's power... Unite, unite, unite, truth...
Unite in struggle for people's power...
We are a part of those concerned with gangs...

Meanwhile, uptown, the DJ a player...

Everybody's so concerned about heroin and marijuana and all that
Until they forget the most dangerousest narcotic that exist's
And that's the narcotic that's injected into the minds of infants...
It's called social narcotics...
So, you know as well as I do that things are changing...
Yeah, change, you know...

Meanwhile, uptown, the DJ a player... Revolution...
Yeah, change, you know... My gift... Make music...

So I say you youngster's gotta get a job
Work to change the system...
Definacy... Equal, justice... Submission...
...Moving on... The people's power...
...Ghetto wack, lining my ears... My gift... Make music...
Change, change, change, it's only a matter of time
Change, change, change, it's only a matter of time
Change, change, change, it's only a matter of time
Change, change, change, change... It's only a matter of time
Freedom! (Freedom!)... That's all that life is...
The record ends and we must begin again...
