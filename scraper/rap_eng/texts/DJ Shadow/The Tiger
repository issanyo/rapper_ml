Move in close, tiger comes into the sun they run
Pray to thee, they come for me into the light and fly
Keep it low, smell that fear, spirits are gathered around
Our ancient hive, sharpened tounge, God comes to send me asleep

Fire brings light, light brings me here
And I run (and I run) like the sun (like the sun)
Cast a light (cast a light), see you try (see you try)
Bet you would (bet you would), use your gun (use your gun)
Bet your time and your money will come, your time will come
Today is not a day just a time, another place in eternity
A time of which no man is part of except in soul
And in the ire of catastrophe you wonder, what will come next?
And you keep what you have to stop what they hear
To fulfill what you saw isn't right

They're so tied, so empires will fall
Soaken smile, the silence is all
Move in close, tiger comes risen free from the snare
Night draws in pillars fall down on your knees if you please

And I run (and I run) for the sun (for the sun)
Across the feilds (across the feilds) burning wheels (burning wheels)
Eye for an eye (eye for an eye), indian sky (indian sky)
Fire brings light, light brings me here
Fire brings light, light brings me here
And I run (and I run) for the sun (for the sun)
Across the feilds (across the feilds) burning wheels (burning wheels)
Eye for an eye (eye for an eye), see you try (see you try)
See you try...
