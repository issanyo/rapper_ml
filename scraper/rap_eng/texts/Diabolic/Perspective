[Verse 1:]

Yo, I set Northern Lights on fire
Get higher off of each bowl
Plot deceitful, we wolves dressed in sheep’s wool
We the people are not accepting our demise
We concealing our identities, a blessing in disguise
Directly in my eyes, that’s where the fire scorches
Seeking higher forces, inside of iron horses
Alive is corpses, with the heroes left to die
Like it’s a standoff at high noon under desert skies
LI to Bedford-Stuy to up town where Tech resides
With God as my witness, I gotta stand and testify
If you real you recognize our lives are jeopardized
So we drink away pain and maintain by getting high
C’mon step inside, play the track, let it ride
See why I burn bridges, turn vicious, sever ties
Cause everytime somebody put Bolic under pressure
Life flash before my eyes and burn an image on my retina

[Hook:]

([samples] – Diabolic. I’m ain’t the type dude you go to war with. I gotta chip on my shoulder. Bring it on. Knock ya head, break the fuck up off ya.) – 2X

[Verse 2:]

Yo, yo, I think it’s easy to tell the life I’m leading is hell
I can see the future, it’s my past repeating itself
Be catching several cases and just sleeping in cells
Like Al-Qaeda plotting to send you plastique in the mail
I know Jesus can feel that I miss my silent nights
Since they been replaced by siren lights and fire fights
I duel on iron mics and excel when it’s crunch time
Double fisted, alcoholism in my blood line
Sometimes they say I’m crazy and they sort of right
I want to go door to door tonight and murdering ’till morning light
Cause I was born poor and I ain’t the corporate type
So maybe when I got shit, I’ll think there’s more to life
‘Till it happens, yeah right, I’ll fight and I’ll paper chase
Off the books, dodging the federal government’s database
At a later date, my paper mate, may just change my fate
Paid to write about the times when I made mistakes, now

[Hook] – 2X

[Verse 3:]

Yo, yo, Lord knows Bolic couldn’t fathom what was foretold
At the crossroads, God talking back in morse code
Lost soul as confused as Donnie Darko
Wishing I was ignorant to these illuminati barcodes
The shit I know could make the human body’s heart blow
Presidential plots supplying Giuliani’s cargo
Car loads of soldiers in illegal wars
With a system designed to keep the poor people poor
To keep the poor asking why the fuck they breathing for
Mad, like let’s burn the flag that we pledge allegiance toward
Tired of these streets, sick of this convenience store
Fuck I do nuttin’ new, everything I’ve seen before
Old E, pounds of weed, G’s of raw
Now I see, keys are pure, stashed in Buick Regal doors
Creating a monster in the street’s deepest core
So it’s time all y’all realize that we at war, c’mon

[Hook] – 2X
