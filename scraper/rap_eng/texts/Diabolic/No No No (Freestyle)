[George Carlin] – "Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you and fuck you…."

Okay
Don’t think they ready for this one (nope)
Here we go (No, No, No)

If things were my way I’d give Diallo that cop’s gun
And put him back to the exact spot they shot from
Reverse the roles, them same cops could catch them hot ones
Screaming at the top of they lungs (No, No, No)

Everytime I heard a squad car’s tire screech
I’d be in the driver seat ready to drive by police
Convince the fire chief the fire heat
‘Til every liar, thief, detective’s cryin’ please (No, No, No)

I might get signed dawg, but I ain’t chancing that
When I could brandish gats, take your advance and stack
See Bolic don’t think you enough of a man to scrap
So you asked yourself and answered back (No, No, No)

Cats be asking if Interscope signed me
Think about it, if they did, is there where I’d be?
But still I got producers like ‘I want five G’s’
When he ran it by me, I said (No, No, No)

I’d rather two track than pay cats to produce that
Believe me, I ain’t wasting the cash that I do stack
I love my money like I love slapping a new jack
Having to move back, saying (No, No, No)

Haha, the game ain’t ready for this one
I’ll show you how to take someone else’s track and do it right
It’s for my people, it’s for my people, it’s for my people
Well fuck that, this for me too

Every mothafucka who rapped, got iron and used it
But killers don’t talk, you either lying or stupid
Y’all claim to bust gats and take lives in your music
But when it’s time to go do it, you like (No, No, No)

It’s not hype, I really am the type who might flip
Icepick your life, at night slit your wife’s wrist
I hit the light switch and realized you tight bitch
When I heard you screaming like this (No, No, No)

Uh-oh, it’s Diabolic and he’s at it again
Only difference this time, he’s two tracking with Pen
His groupie caught feelings in the back of a Benz
When I tried stabbing her friend, she said (No, No, No)

I’m not the one you want to go face to face with
No, no, no, just ask the kid who made this
Quest told him to battle me on this Foul Play shit
Buy Jae’s bitch so his manager said (No, No, No)

Haha, I stay laughing man
These games of fucking rap, I already told you
It’s over with, I’m a fucking problem
We’ll see what’s gonna happen
It’s for my people, it’s for my people, it’s for my people
Well fuck that, this for me too
