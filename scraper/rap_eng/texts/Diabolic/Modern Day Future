[George Carlin talking]

Yeah, sooner or later the people in this country are gonna realize the government does not give a fuck about them
Government doesn’t care about you, or your children, or your rights, or your welfare, or your safety
It simply doesn’t give a fuck about you
It’s interested in its own power, that’s the only thing, keeping it and expanding it wherever possible…

[Diabolic]

I ain't no ‘conscious political rapper’
I just say real shit

[Verse 1]

I see the truth in lies
Music let you see it through my eyes
Its do or die, kill or be killed; choose you’re sides
I may just shoot the five, or maybe shoot the 5
Cops cruisin’ by my block rockin suits and ties
I lead the likes of freedom fighters full of foolish pride
Pale horse, close as you and I since William Cooper died
Unified front, guns to the sky: drunk
Screaming at the top of my lungs
You only die once!
Living on the edge, mission torn to shreds
Pigeon on the ledge, had to snitch and warn the feds
But I was born and bred to give the blind some higher learning
And the tides are turning like a drunk driver tires swerving
This ain't no quiet sermon, see i’m an Irish/German
Genes spliced with Tyler Durden, fighting till I die for certain
So take a look into my eyes, you’ll see the fire’s burning
And afterwards let’s reveal the guy behind the curtain

[Hook: Deadly Hunta]

Witness the modern day slavery
Forget the chain, I rip them full of shit
They want to tag you with the microchip
This a modern day slavery
Why don’t you open your eyes?
And realize…
Were living in a modern day slavery
They give us crack and gun
To kill each other in the slum
While their dictating fascism
Modern day slavery
It’s them wolfs in disguise
Oh yeah, yeah…

[Verse 2]

While Bush throws the horns of Satan
I see the wars he’s waging
Like he owes a mortgage payment to some oil corporation
And what my daughter’s facing makes me wanna stop rhyming
And start stock piling Glock nines and rock climbing
Corrupted presidents, disappearing evidence
And symbols that could represent the future in the present tense
I tried to talk to God from a crucified position
But then I lost my job, now im losing my religion
Some alcoholic slob on a suicidal mission
Against the odds, nothing to lose but my conviction
And to you politicians living in your fathers shell
I hope you rot in hell, sharing Jeffrey Dahmer’s cell
I hope he eats you while you alive and gotta yell
And your fate repeats eternally on stage at Rock The Bells
So everybody else can get a taste of retribution
When generation X is laughing through your execution

[Hook: Deadly Hunta]

Witness the modern day slavery
Forget the chain, I rip them full of shit
They want to tag you with the microchip
This a modern day slavery
Why don’t you open your eyes?
And realize…
Were living in a modern day slavery
They give us crack and gun
To kill each other in the slum
While their dictating fascism
Modern day slavery
It’s them wolfs in disguise
Oh yeah, yeah…

[Diabolic Talking]

Now’s not the time for picket signs
Or letters to your senator and etcetera
If you love your children, if you love yourself
You’ll throw down the fucking hand that’s dealt
And cut the puppet strings attached to your life
Fuck it! See you in hell muthafucka!
