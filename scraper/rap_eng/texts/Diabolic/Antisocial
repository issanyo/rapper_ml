[Verse One: Danimal Lector]

I don't know you from a hole in the wall, so bye bye
Mirror, mirror who's the dopest of all? Why lie?
Lookie lookie,  pussy wussy, it's him again
Time to get rid of the middle man
Give me a minute, I'm a finish them
Synonym for winnin', with Ritalin dripping rhythms
Kickin' so much ass I broke the fucking branches off these Timbalands
You're witnessing a man who finally lost it, aw shit
Fuck a co-sign I'm on my boss shit
Faggot motherfuckers catch a broom in the ass for bad behavior
D-Lect style, code name: Vlad, the Impaler
No average player, I'mma stunt, I'll catch you later
And it's CT all day, 'til they bring back the fucking Waylers
Must I remind them I'm grinding? Stop me, ho
On fire, I should motherfucking drop and roll
I'm a weirdo, but honest, though
Give me six feet to lay six deep
Bitch, please, I gotta go

[Hook: Danimal Lector]

I'm only one step away from going postal
That's gotta be the reason I'm so antisocial
So I suggest that you do as you're told to
GET THE FUCK BACK, man, I don't know you (x2)

[Verse Two: Diabolic]

I hustled hard, stacks of paper, got this label started
Played the market, set my sights high, sprayed the target
They say I'm heartless, bordering on sacrilegious
When y'all the ones that sold your soul to go from rags to riches That's why I'm acting vicious as a rabid pit is
Smacking bitches that refers to rap as if you have it twisted
Now back to business, fuck that, lets motivate
Don't debate, I captured the essence, there's no escape
Closed the gate, produced the solo, and the musics loco
Tattoo my logo on Riff Raff, now do some promo
Art of Rap, Ice-T, peace to you and Coco
The only thing these Soulja Boy's will ever shoot is promos
Zoom in slo-mo, focus frames, it's open game to roast a lame
With a flamethrower, fans will go insane
I hold the pain I overcame close, and drove the slain
The most acclaimed lyricist there is and you don't know his name

[Hook: Danimal Lector]

I'm only one step away from going postal
That's gotta be the reason I'm so antisocial
So I suggest that you do as you're told to
GET THE FUCK BACK, man, I don't know you (x2)
