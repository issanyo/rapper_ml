[Intro]
Uh huh
Grind Mode Cypher
Diabolic whattup

[Verse 1: Lingo]
What the deal player? I get nice on mic devices
A true trailblazer so I'm hikin' up my prices
Debate it now, wait an hour and lay it down
Then lock it in a vault so my music's safe and sound
Protect from biters, who watch and respect the fighters
Unless you writing that check, I'm chic-checking you biters
Infecting your life, like insects with a bite
Suckin' dumbs you fucking dumb, guess incest is inside you
Blatant or discreet you're hating on a G
Emcee
Damn he
Gotta take it to the street
See?
Place a beat, and it's like placement on a beat
So I'm son'ing these pigs, so they bakin' in the heat
Deal breakers break fast and they steal paper
From mass appeal and ask for a meal later
Blast the steel with Jesus grabbing the wheel savior
Oxymoronic cause all of y'all real fakers

[Verse 2: Rippz]
The roadie devil I'm damaging drums with Diabolic
So blow these rebels and don't forget to swallow the tonic
The flow be celibate never finding a fuck to give
To chauvinistic rappers and trap is stuck on some sucker shit
Not me though, defiant with a giant ego
And I'm about as iron as Mike Tyson with a mic and a beat yo
Spit vernacular nastiness better let it go
Ask anybody Rippz is spectacularly incredible
SLAM! Let the boys be boys
And you ain't gotta be on X, better bring the noise
Public Enemy number one I'm Dillinger with the paint mayne
Ridiculous riddled rhythms alliteration my end game
A stone cold ben grip when I blow so throwin' boulders
Old soul, young rebel the 401 is on my shoulders
Any questions you better address a General properly
Hip-hop is still breathin', say different u trying not to be

[Verse 3: D-Gazz]
Dante's inferno, Mister Diablo
You an intern, so in turn it's me you follow
I could be tomorrow see defeat and still defeat the power
I'm devouring these rappers like the feast of beats
And cease the heater of lies I'm the breeder of rhymes
Your minds peace, come get a piece of my mind
I'm from the smallest state, it's something like a crucifix
Because every time I say I'm in R-I, I'm in our ride
It's like I'm reading it off a crucifix
If that went over your head, you must be new to this
Cause Lingo set the track like that know when i do the shit
If you a ?? shit I got rhymes to make you duck, duck
And raise the bar make these rappers clap like back to dump trucks
You dumb fucks couldn't handle this
It's grind mode, two fakers and we put you out like a candle wick
We're brawl game, Diabolic won't stand for it

[Verse 4: Massaka]
All that
Medicinal haze got your visual's vague
Now your sitting in the state collecting minimum wage
Wishin' your game was sharp
Like a barber with a straight razor
It wasn’t really you, fake heart - pacemaker
You really think I didn’t come to rap, son?
My only task - don’t be task one
Come on Cory, how could you be that dumb?
Real underground cats knew exactly where you grabbed it from
Man fuck that, it’s the grind mode cypher
Hard rhymers, no bar biters and ghost writers
When you flow, it’s comparable to Alzheimer's
But me?
You can feel it in your bones like arthritis
And I ain’t gotta throw a line to try n’ hook 'em
Even though I read you, I wouldn’t book 'em
You counterfeit by the sounds of it [womp womp womp]
You Charlie Brownin’ it

[Verse 5: Easty]
Y’all are task one copies
Diabolic’s grandson
Shots below the belt, I ain’t reachin' for a handgun
I put in work
One take, I’m hitting every snare drum
Throw my three’s
I’m the man to cross em’ up, and one
Bringing back the ‘bolic that’s as potent as the chronic
Been smoking, it toking it
Hold my dick since you on it
My diction you could turn a dictionary into a dinosaur
Breaking verses like a spinal cord ‘til my final raw want beef
Bring the cattle to the final battle
Here I’m in my Golden State and you wish you a Cavalier
Real as a tatted tear
Drip below the eye line, I’m just like Hernandez
Killer for lifetime
Like my neck tatted, fuck the game like a sex addict
Throwing slugs through the atmosphere I got the best balance
When i crack a pen, I swear it’s the X factor
Y’all are last week's headlines, and I’m the next chapter

[Verse 6: Passionate MC]
Seeking in a sleeveless and gloves
When I’m walking and they can’t tell if it's me
Or if it’s scorpion assaulting I’m offing ‘em
Gripped you by your feet to life you off of them
Then body everybody ‘til your body hits the floor again
So quick it’s like the time froze
Pulled the strap to tie around your dome
Like the blindfold
Your whole circle will divide slow
And catch three when I drink this one fourth like a pinecone
Disassembling your team
You will never see this passed down
I am not a hereditary gene
I am truthfully unique like Bruce Lee
With his two legs that’ll knock you each into two weeks from next Tuesday
But back to the present, a psychopathic obsession
For burying the dead in wet cement for a lasting impression
And when I’m finished
It’s your girls I screw
Cause I’ve done seen more top than a birds eye view

[Verse 7: Diabolic]
I’ve been getting dome from this hottie Margeaux in a Monte Carlo
She tries yapping, I die laughing like Donnie Darko
Couple margaritas and she wants the hardest wiener
Followed by, "you ain’t shit"
Okay bitch, you aren’t either
My bars are ether
Either that or scarlet fever
Ask for verses I’m a plastic surgeon, I charge for features
Dark tequila makes me a heartless creature
Without an axe to grind a hatchet’s fine
I’m the sharpest cleaver
I spark the reefer indigo or (?) sativa
On this same couch ‘til I’m spaced out like parking meters
Martian leaders are attacking Earth from other worlds
Cause I crossed my DNA with theirs when I fucked his girl
I get drunk and hurl call the bitch a b (?) crew
Pull out my dick and I mix the gene pool, piss and refuel
I be cool cause I can take inanimate objects
And trap them in a concept like captive Vietnam vets
Ah yes, start babbling some nonsense
And the bitch is going crazy like Carrie in a prom dress
I just drift off and process my sick thoughts
More sicker than a mortician with his dick in a stiff corpse
