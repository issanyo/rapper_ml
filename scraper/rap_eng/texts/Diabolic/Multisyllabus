[Intro: Danegurous]
Yeah... Uh
Danegurous, Apathy, Diabolic and C-Lance
Underworld, Motherfucker
Real lyricists up in this bitch
SP, Crime Family
Let's go

[Verse 1: Apathy]
I make paper off Hip Hop, I used to pickpocket for profit
Was a pit stop, but now I picks stocks that rocket
Give the godz they offering, I ain't got a lot of options
In jail hustling toxin's or bare knuckle boxing
A bear size cracker that paralyze the wacker
I terrorize rappers, compare our rhymes after
Big difference, big dish, let's leave 'em with some ribs missing
Run up on their kids christening wizard of Wig Splitting
Abra Kadabra, turn cadavers into anti-matter
Stab you, unravel your abdomen blood plasma splatters
Straight bullet shatters plasma screens
Loading up the magazine It's not a nightmare, it's a savage dream
I got bags full of green, you make average cream
You're a passive queen I'm a massive mean radioactive green
Hulk that will smash your spleen
Spit a paragraph and take a bath in gasoline

[Hook: Scratches]
"Multisyllabus"
"Welcome to the next level"
"Make a non believer see a miracle"
"The question is, can you top that homie?
You can probably pull something close but stop that homie"
"Fasten your seat belts for take off and landing
The game been over, because the lead is too commanding"
"You can bring your best but you never match this flow"
"We rise above it and they love it"
*Moaning*
"Makes ya mad, don't it?"

[Verse 2: Danegurous]
Ripping it up when the beat has begun
Danegurous, Ap and Diabolic
Ripping it up with the weed in my lung
Blaze a bag of fire chronic
Vile-vomit-bile living it up cause we are the ones
Sticking em up with the heater and run
Picking it up and I leave in a rush
Hush... As a kid I didn't listen much
Solicited illicit drugs
So listen I'm sick as fuck
Explicit, I pissed on sluts
Sadistic, I'll slit ya jug
Consistent, you a sitting duck
I'm gifted with a twisted tongue
Never interrupt when gripping on a pistol pump
Sipping on a fifth of rum, splitting the biggest thickest dutch
With the finest strands filling up my diaphragm
Fiddle on the violin killin' a man, I'm Meyer Lan-sky
Silent stampede for the fans to see insanity
Violent fantasies for your fam to grieve
You ain't a fan of me
You are now, demanding me
I plan to be branded elite panic and leave
Check the spanish speech
I'm peligroso plenty loco
Semi .44 get ready machete for any local
Many so-so so I put 'em in the fetal position
The evilest is him get beaten like Gs in the prison
You people are tripping like believing that Jesus is Christian
Cease a critic shadow people wrecking beats per minute
D's predictions that you'll speak but you full shit
My mutli's legitimate
Study the multisyllabus, Bitch

[Hook: Scratches]

[Verse 3: Diabolic]
I used to love her, until some dudes abused and fucked her
Now I speak a Broken Language
I learned from Smoothe Da Hustla
Throwing uppercuts till suckers guts ooze and rupture
Fighting like I'm Iron Mike, but never lose it to a Buster
I'm just too unorthodox for the conformist flock
Because I inspire Blacks, Whites, and Puerto Rocs that slaughter cops
We need to change
Let freedom reign like water drops
And tear down the fences they use to keep the borders locked
Squeeze a warning shot, homie, we on a daily grind
And you rarely find the feeling you get when you hear me rhyme
Clearly, I'm the cat who came back to raise the bar
When you come with cheap bubblegum shit like packs of trading cards
Smack a famous star backwards, jack his favorite car
Making Muslims pray to God while the Catholics praise Allah
Taking part of something different, give it what's been missing
Sipping rum, getting drunk and pissing on every sucker living

[Hook: Scratches]
