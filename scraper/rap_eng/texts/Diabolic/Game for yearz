"We want one thing. We declare our rank on this earth, to be a man, to be a human being, to be respected as a human being, to be given the rights of a human being. In this society, on this earth, in this day, which we intend to bring into existence, by any means necessary."

[Hook:]
4X [I've] been in this game for years, it made me an uh
I may be an animal,It's rules to this shit
I wrote me a manual
3X [I've] been in this game for years, it made me an uh
It's rules to this shit
I wrote me a manual

[Verse 1:Diabolic]

Read the prophecy, I believe the streets are watchin' me
Like police with a warrant to search and seize my property
The demon side of me exhales a breath of smoke
When I feel the beat in my chest like a stethoscope, check my pulse
My neck is broke from the weight that's on my shoulder blades
And I'll hold the rage close, 'till I go from broke to paid
Seen the coldest days, how life came and life changed
Broke the mold, told Satan my soul's out his price range
I'm prone to violence if a soldier broke the code of silence
Shed an ultraviolet, 'till you open both your eyelids
I've been nice since your mama made you rock pajamas
You's was playin' cops and robbers, tell your team not to bother
I'll chop ya roster of imposters, pass the actors
That I smash and fracture up inside a trash compactor
Ain't no manufactured rapper for the industry
The simple shit I spit for free will let me live in infamy

[Hook]

[Verse 2:Nickles]

Nowadays the games kind of fucked up in the rap gallery
Head honchos are calling the game of casualties
So I load up the pump, pop and clickin' mallory
Natural born killer, coming thru with my armory
Wat up, yo it's Nicks, walk ya pop like a tray 8 <--(?)
Rock the spot doc, make it hotter than hell's gates
Po-Po on the seen, I'll be alley like eight eights <--(?)
Fuck the case, fuck the jake, I'll bluff with a straight face
No time to get locked up, it's time to replaced, so
Tighten your lace, prepare for the worst
To all you weak MC's, I'mma take you to church
Rap is my weapon, leave you in the back of a hearse
Rap's been in my veins, since the day of my birth
Took it in with the first deep breath on the earth
Been in the game, so fall back, you're gonna get hurt
Sign, Nicks mothafuckas, yo I put in my work

[Chours]

[Verse 3:Pot Bull]

I've been in this game for years, I think I'm losing my mind
I tried too many times, but they just too blind to see me
Believe me, it's the skills that you're lackin'
Your bones crackin', and you ain't packin' no pistols
I'll whip you, slick your girl up like Crisco
And switch flows, you don't want to dance at this disco
Bitch ho, that's what you are to me
Pardon me, but your rhymes styles is garbage B
I'm retarded, I'm startin' the fuckin' revolution
I'm pollutin', start movin' your neck to the sound that be oozin' out the speakers
Leaders of blood get spilled out the tweet
As my sneakers placed on your grill
Everytime I'll rip the mic line, I'm devine
Light shine, in hindsight, vision don't pay it no mind
I told y'all, I run with a sick team
And this beat chopped up like lettuce and swiss cheese

[Hook]
