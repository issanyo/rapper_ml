[Intro: Diabolic]
We told these truths to be self-evident: that all men are created equal; that they are endowed by their creator with certain unalienable rights; that among these are life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness; that to secure these rights, governments are instituted among men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed; that whenever any form of government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the right of the people to alter or abolish it, and to institute new government

[Verse 1: Diabolic]
A decade since 9/11, jihad went kamikaze
Only proof's a photoshopped picture of Bin Laden's body
Now breakdown conspiracy, theory or hypothesis
My educated guess, the politics are obvious
From monoliths in GC, to what you watch on TV
NBC, the Comcast bought from GE
Goes way beyond that to defense contracts
The War on Terror gives an endless excuse for combat
The hierarchy doesn't need to justify the battle plan
That has us land planes in Iraq or Afghanistan
All they need is scare tactics, visualise an avalanche
Support from mass media, who supplied the cameraman?
The average man doesn't see the complicated falsehoods
But y'all should, still don't mention Operation Northwoods
It's all good 'cause I will expose the inappropriate
Plots from black ops to frame Cuba and the Soviets
Now there's an epidemic of Middle Eastern dope we get
The CIA imported all these opiates and sold me it
Oxycotin, now the roxies got it, move to heroin
That mixed with fluoride and water and you're American
American as Verichips tracking you with circuitry
Surgically compatible with National Security
American as litigation and disinformation
While Monsanto controls the food and drug administration
American as kids who eat the GMOs you're giving them
Or using school curriculums as a tool restricting them
American as the hero who will never die
Teach your kids to think critically instead of memorise

[Chorus: Diabolic]
Say A-M-E-R-I-C-A (A-M-E-R-I-C-A)
Say A-M-E-R-I-C-A (A-M-E-R-I-C-A)
Then plot against your own, it's the American way
Say A-M-E-R-I-C-A (A-M-E-R-I-C-A)
Say A-M-E-R-I-C-A (A-M-E-R-I-C-A)
Then plot against your own, it's the American way

[Verse 2: Diabolic]
Y'all know about the Bush's, well let's examine Prescott
A known Nazi in the notes from J. Edgar's desktop
Next stop after Hoover seize the Union Bank
He's elected to the Senate, really moving through the ranks
But there's much more, his son George is about to make it big
While he oversees the operatives in the Bay of Pigs
Direct involvement with the coup attempt in Dallas, Texas
He watched as Howard Hunt and Frank Sturgess murdered Kennedy
Eventually he's CIA Director, let's coordinate
While Howard Hunt Does Nixon's Dirt During Watergate
Formulate a plan, execute it perfectly
And employ the same tactics Hitler did in Germany
Certainly, we can give the Skull and Bones fraternity
A pass to commit treason and murder in the first-degree
Certainly, we can make this psychopath the President
That mixed with true belief in lies and you're American
American as the Great Depression when the stocks fell
An alien flying saucer cover-ups in Roswell
American as police that never read your rights
Or blaming mass hallucination for the Phoenix Lights
American as watching cellphones, every kilobyte
Our President Obama pissing on the Bill of Rights
American as oil tycoons from the West
With the words "We the people" tattooed on my chest

[Chorus: Diabolic]
Say A-M-E-R-I-C-A (A-M-E-R-I-C-A)
Say A-M-E-R-I-C-A (A-M-E-R-I-C-A)
Then plot against your own, it's the American way
Say A-M-E-R-I-C-A (A-M-E-R-I-C-A)
Say A-M-E-R-I-C-A (A-M-E-R-I-C-A)
Then plot against your own, it's the American way
