[Hook]
It's my turn
I was given the power
And I'd rather die fighting than live as a coward
If I do what I feel and say what I want
At least you'll know it's me when you're playing my song
[2X]

[Verse 1]
Got evil through my soul
Jealous and hatin'
It's a hell of a statement but I'd sell it to Satan
End up handcuffed in a cell in his basement
Praying to Jesus when I fell to the pavement
I ain't got religion or a pot to piss in
I think the worst it happens the plot just thickens
The clock is ticking
I don't twist words
I'll leave your throat slit in six thirds like Nick Berg
I can flip birds
Make the cash I like
But I'd rather write, make fun of death, and laugh at life
Parasites will take what I stack for spite
Cause I get G's when I flip P's like Vanna White
Today was a good day, I drove past your wife
Got her number and I'mma get the ass tonight
I'll slash you twice
Ain't showing remorse
I’ll just catch a body, like you’re throwin' a corpse

[Hook x2]

[Verse 2]
(Here we go)
Excuse me lady look how crazy your driving him
Got 99 problems, my bitch is 85 of em
I've changed
At war with my mind frame
Scheming to even the score like tied games
I've gained loss
Where pain's the main course
Me and my alter ego don't share the same thoughts
My brain's warped
I don't buy what stars sell me
But I'll double team a troubled teen with R. Kelly
Begin some rumors that offend consumers
I'm sadistic with a twisted sense of humor
I wanna body 8 Jakes with a straight face
And leaving 'em leaking like info bout Kobe's rape case
I love to gamble but I'm the same soldier
Who won't bet the under cause I'm bout to take over
There'll be no second guessing me chump
Cause I'll murder you if you ever question me once

[Hook x2]

[Verse 3]
Tortured genius more respect less connected
The aborted fetus, Immortal Tech resurrected
The filthiest affiliate
But don't feel me if I impale ‘em on the coathanger they killed me with
I do an eye for an eye
But I don't respect ya
So I used an aids needle to stab both your retinas
Student and teacher
Killed my own professor
He ain't understand I was too old to lecture
I paper chase and hustle but hate to scuffle
When we go hand and hand I always break your knuckles
I'll bless the mic
That's my only offer
You couldn't bless shit with a toilet full of holy water
I'll use brute force to introduce two forts
Fornicate with your mind
Fuck what you thought
Life's too short so I'm not concerned
I'll show you how to do this
Just watch and learn

It's my turn
I was given the power
And I'd rather die fighting than live as a coward
If I do what I feel and say what I want
At least you'll know it's me when you're playing my song
[2X]
