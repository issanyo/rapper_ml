[Intro - Poison Pen:]

Live from the Beat X
Awar
We got the Fallen Angels
We got Triple Optix
We got Stronghold
That's what's poppin' yo
Diabolic, Poison Pen, Awar
Let's take 'em to war yo
Take 'em to war yo

[Verse 1:Awar]

I'm here, stainless steel ice grill, razor proof skin
Do a show in hell, raise the roof with enough space to move in
Walkin' with Satan's troops, I'm color changing your mood rings
Raid the food in your fridge with a sabor tooth grin
Chomp it down, I'll make your smile mold a necklace
And kick a black hole in your solar plexus, on my stomping grounds
You speak Islamic now, rap in a broken language
Translating Bin Laden in a Pig Latin and ten axes
And a pimp's passion, walk with a little limp action
Sprinklin' baby powder on mits for my assistant pimps who get distracted
I'm [??], and if I said it I meant it
I'll have your girl missing periods like a run on sentence
So keep your guns on the entrance, or play laser tag with inferreds
The kiss of death, serving molotov cocktails in hell's kitchen
Lethal weapon like Mel Gibson
Death to the fate of your ruler
Cause my fam drops enough gems to bankrupt Jacob the jeweler
Wake up your medula, you don't tote Glocks, you smoke cocks in the industry
Your infantry sounds like a bunch of broke Pacs
[??] never sold rock but I got your souls locked on a triple beam, like ya blown hops to smithereens

Chorus - Poison Pen:

[??] y'all, put [??] on the back of your throat
Jump y'all, you think that we crackin' a joke
Stuff y'all, rough y'all, cut y'all, crush y'all
??? what the fuck y'all
[2X]

[Verse 2:Diabolic]

Yo, cops are lookin' for an excuse to call reinforcements
So proceed with caution, or see a coffin
I'll read your fortune, I can see the future
Squeeze a Ruger, serve beef like Peter Luger
D's and troopers, the first of three targets
To get set up framed, for first degree charges
Any rapper you put verses me garbage
I'd rather serve or pee and burn the weed harvest
You cannot be hood, you Hollywood pussy
Well 'bolic just want that Hollywood pussy
I could rap for weeks, y'all just rappin' weak
You ain't have the streets, you had 'em fast asleep
I ain't blastin' heat, na I slash and butcher
Cause y'all punk bitches like Ashton Kutcher
Diabolic, man with the shortest fuse
Defeat's out my price range, can't afford to lose
Money talks, it speaks and I listen
And life's the bitch with bare feet in my kitchen
Screamin' and bitchin' so I'm plottin' for wealth
Gettin' bars off my chest like I'm spottin' myself

[Hook]

[Verse 3:Awar]

Yo, my optical stance, standin' at the top of the planet
Hip-Hop's the only obstacle in the ways of dollars I can't get
If I gotta pack [confised??] cannon to profit off the promise land
To blow up popsicle stands, slayin' contraband
I'll get my chance yeah, you smile for the media
Blurb about the jewels he havin'
I'll get your smile in a mediums, and curve your enthusiasm
Cause I flirt with death, like the Grin Reaper had a trim beaver
I work out tracks like a gym teacher's new receiver
I make your protojays, slit your throat with your shoulder blade
Motivate cultin' visions, because when inside and out and it's the only ultimatum
And every degenerate knows, I won't rest my dome
With airwaves flooded with my genetic clones
When the name Awar rest in peace is etched in the headstone
The beats bang like Gang Initiation
Free Easy Duke till a pulp fiction

[Hook] - 2X
