[Diabolic]

Imagine being driven crazy, but seeking greener pastures
And the voices in your head are a bunch of demons screaming at ya
Power to the people, make their egos shatter
They're full of shit leaking nothing but some fecal matter
Paranoid like who's that peeking in my window
It's the NSA and they're scheming on my info
I don't like to talk, keep secrets within kin folk
Face to face no phone, meeting up on Skid Row
Police will come and tip toe, missions get aborted
I really should of saw it but my vision was distorted
Probably should have said no to this liquor when I poured it
But I get twisted and record it, shits listener supported
No state of the art equipment, we're playing the cards we're given
It's a statement of our conviction like playing the yard in prison
But I've been losing faith, not praying to God or wishing
To me that shit equates to praising Allah for Christians

(hook by Tones)
It's the torture, anger, the murder, disgust
It's the envy, betrayal, the struggle, the lust
Roaming when I'm home, it's the feeling when alone
It's the torture, the anger, the murder, disgust
It's the envy, betrayal, the struggle, the lust
Roaming til I'm home, when I'm feeling all alone

I swing a bigger stick, nibble on your bitches clit
I eat like I got a dozen assholes for shitting with
Fucking electrifying stick my dick in an outlet
I petrify guys having 'em shitting in they outfit
Tear souls torn from out kids, don't doubt that I'm 'bout this
Turn them into dust and throw they ashes off a mountain
Return like the Third Reich and burn like a hippy
Run 'em off the turnpike for sucking like a hickey
Suckas shifty, bitches must be on some Whitney
'Cause you cunts is smoking crack if you think you fucking with me
And you could die right there and leave an ugly corpse
I take your keys and do some doughnuts in your fucking Porsche
Piss me off bat swinging like a pendulum
Do a Homi on your team like Swave, Pump and Pen and them
For some Benjamins you could see the other side
The hunter is the hunted so you better run and hide

[Buttatones]

Third eye awakening, flesh to the soul
Cuffed to the fire, fed to the cold
Locked in a dungeon, forgotten since a young'un
Chased by my shadow and they not even coming
Engaged in the battle, born on a different level
Disheveled from the death, delivered by the devil
Thoughts undefined, talking in rhyme
Lost in the lines or it's all in my mind
Chewed by the parasites, watched by the satellites
Life in the stars, astrologers are sacrificed
Diseased from distraught, disturbed by disgust
At peace with the war and all that I've lust
Songs from the coffin torn into portions
Travel through the clarity, lost in distortion
Many personalities coming by the hundred
Got me in your scope but the hunter is the hunted

(Hook)
