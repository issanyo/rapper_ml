[Tab]
Found God in the gutter on a turnpike level
This is more like trouble, I am oh so subtle
Ocho doubled over, hit em with the verbal yoga
Vertigo from going where I shouldn't go to
Draw the shutters, start creating with the shut ins
Make nothing out of something, I been too woke to function
Peep the deconstruction right before the introductions
Excluding with instructions, the Buddha got a question
Don't chase the narrative, odds are they are comparing us
The signal from the obelisk preparing us
Polish off the bottle still anonymous in old age
Work day what a dull blade
Flow state
Take shape
Rotate
No taste
Open
Shut
No case
Blow the whistle
Pork face
I've been having off days
Tucked in the crawl space
Shadow in the hall ways
Big bird
Small cage
New level
No saves

[Taboo]
Preparing for lift off like space camp
Bout to face this plant until I face plant
Life hit me in the nuts with a kick it threw from Christ's stance
Spewing the same rants, I'm truly a changed man
Ruining your day plans, this wasteland is so savage
I see it all cuz I poked a hole through these rose glasses
I'm the phoenix that rose from its own ashes
Like a soul passing as it rose from a ghost out of a closed casket
An obstacle will get its whole ass kicked
You better know I set a goal and then I John Doe toe tag ya
Rolling down the road in an old classic
Slower than molasses, catching brain in my whip like Onassis
They slow the passage with the roads that they block
But you can't break the broken whether you hope to or not
There's power in the practice, we're not going to stop
Flowers in the attic, we've rose to the top

[Diabolic]
It's been an uphill climb, as I approach the summit
I'm just hoping that I overcome it, time to go and fuck it
Broke as fuck and over budget, moving slow and sluggish
Stemming from the thorns in my side but I rose above it
Ducking what I'm told to covet son it's so seductive
And the strings attached they hold you up will just control the puppet
I ain't with that bullshit, unless it's growing fungus
Broken up, insult the stone as near my home in Suffolk
I analyze the circle in my photo bucket
Smoking dutches till I see the whole circumference like a golden compass
As for social justice, I picture blowing trumpets while the 54th Civil War soldiers load their muskets
I picture Lincoln quoting Douglas, and hope to uplift
Like a tractor beam moving those UFO's abducted
So in closing here's a gem I told my youngest:
"Set a goal and never slow til you're close enough to cobra clutch it"
