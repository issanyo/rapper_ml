[Malone/Hersemann]

Two sides
Of the same coin
Hemispheres
Mental imagery
Disarray
Of the inner self
The "ID" has split
Causing sanity to melt
Trains of thought
Start to form
Unbeknownst
To the main persona
Leading to
Calamity
As the mind
Begins to consume itself!
Why?
Am I?
So cursed?
Inside?
Within
The form
Behind
My eyes
Exists
Too much
To
Survive
I must
Abide
The war
Of my
Selves
As I exist here alone
I feel as though I'm not alone
Things around me are inside me
Making all my senses thrown
Beating fists within my brain
Swelling veins, am I insane?
Voices calling in all directions
Frequencies are ever-changing
Now the voices turn to shrieks
Drowning out benevolence
Rolls of skin beneath my nails
As I pull my flesh away
I must find out what is in me
And show the world that I'm sane
Until that time arises
I will make the world feel my pain
