[Verse 1: Diabolic]
Yeah
Sky's the limit?
Nah, I'm high enough to fly up in it
Fry a Dutch and drop the scientific, that's defying physics
Applying sick shit, cold as Freon liquid
Your girl passed by the far side because she on his dick
A misfit, but the bitches like me because I act realer
Saying "I'm really into Mac Miller, but you rap iller"
Still I gotta struggle
I'd rather throw an uppercut to lift these suckers up like girls feet playing double dutch
So fellas knuckle up
Ladies shake ya bubble butts like you in the strip club to hustle for a couple bucks
What the fuck is good?
We rolling thick in Gotham like "Fuck critics with a dick too big to fit inside him"
On top or rock bottom, 'Bolic always stayed the same
Played the game, and didn't like the flavor when he tasted fame
I ain't ashamed to say I'll take your watch or take your chain
You'll need Storm from the X-Men to come and make it rain

[Hook x4: Diabolic & Coast]
Here we go, yo
Here we go (Here we go)
Here we go, yo
Let 'em know (let 'em know)

[Verse 2: Coast]
I don't give a warning shot
You should know the time lately
Fuck a pussy up like an over-sized baby
I'm retarded when it comes to being rational
I'm sticking something sharp into your heart and then I slash a dude
Blast a fool, fuck it we could all fight
I got the best product on the street like I'm Walt White
Break 'em off bad, make a compound fracture
Stomp down rappers, y'all softer than alpaca
Wild cracker from the Island where they shoot dope
Better pray I'm swinging for the fences like I'm Pujols
Don't judge a book by its cover, you should know the rest
I be broke as fuck the day after they wrote the check
Fucking animal, living like a misfit
Proud like a motherfucker, I ain't never did shit
So tell a rapper that I beat him in his cum catcher
If you came to front, I'll stomp your lungs out your guts, bitch!

[Hook x4]

[Verse 3: Diabolic]
Verse 3, coming with that THC
Diabolic, murder that boom BAP
Boom bap, the new jacks wanna replace me
That's fine, your flatline on the EKG
Words on the street'll reach the asphalt
Last call to face off like we're eating bathsalts
Brass balls in my nutsack
Rappers, clutch that
Society says to conform

[Verse 4: Coast]
I'm like fuck that
Bust gats, you dumb cats is asinine
Rapping about your guns while I pass the time blasting mine
Smash your spine, get beat bloody and snotty
You buttcheeks, your beats buffy the body
We get it in, pack bongs, that's a medicine
Crack em in the mouth, black out like ConEdison
I'm a veteran, even though we just met
Coast been killing shit a long time, make these punks check

[Hook x4]
