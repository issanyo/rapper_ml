[Intro: Talking]
Yo I thought they gave you fair warning, bitch
You should’ve listened
You know you done fucked up, right
Diabolic, ha ha ha

[Chorus: Diabolic]
One, two, three
Rest in peace Talib Kweli
Crying like make it stop
That shit isn’t hiphop, you ho

[Verse: Diabolic]
I did some research read your piece it needs work
Ain't medium dot com the place you buy your tee shirts
I had a knee jerk reaction while you cry and tremble
Petrified not only do you generalize you lie in general
Doubting my potential cause my skin is white
Shit if writing's your super power making sense is kryptonite
But don't doubt the fact I'll show up at your crib tonight
And hit you with a right for each thing you wrote I didn't like
Online picking fights 'til Pen and Tech addressed it
Not for me they stepped in so this bitch wouldn't get his head split
Then you said if I was sorry you'd apologize
Followed by a convo 'bout the boys Bambatta sodomized
Do not deny the truth ho you asked for evidence
And that's the precedent you set when Tech was at your residence
Now I'm addressing it to fill the part that's missing
And the parts you skipped in all that Kickstarter shit you started kicking
Disregard the fiction I'm not the only artist living
To fuck a few orders up doesn't mean they aren't shipping
I've given back to this culture and it's clear
The only vultures that appeared circle over your career
Yeah you popped off once stock dropped off jump
So severe your whole career's become a sophomore slump
Chump I walk through crowded sidewalks in Bedstuy
Bump shoulders and knock this punk over just to get by
Then I meet Swave Sevah at the back bar
At a Black Star show wondering where the fuck the blacks are
So how you go on Twitter with the nerve to act hard
Your crowd's the same as one at Talladega watching NASCAR
You wack par as far as rhyming to beats
You’re too busy finding Kelis to hide behind when there's beef
You’re too busy with the scene telling lies in your tweets
If you were real Mr Green you'd do it live in the streets
While I’d make sure the prophecy still holds true
Stop fronting ain't dropped something quality since '02
That's probably why you feel so obsolete and old school
In boat shoes fresh off your shopping spree at Whole Foods
You're like so cool in your French heels and neckerchiefs
'Til I fire cannons out of left field like Cespedes
When your homie Niko's left feeling pressed a bit
In LA you do nothing [?] protects the kid
That's my regiment so if I were trying to silence you
I would now shut the fuck up here's what I would do if were you
I'd find a crew like mine to squeeze a round at tyrants who
Really hold your people down not tweet at clowns to ride for you
But that's too live for you that's why my record player's
Playing Respiration while every breath you're taking's through a respirator
Shedding rays of light like neon gas
Don't need Vinia singing to put Kweli on blast
Just throw a beat on won't see Sean you're beyond trash
Dream on I'll air a smith at your pee on ass
Like it's my theme song Steven's got them screams on smash
Your CD's for rolling weed on my Nissan dash
Now be gone fast quick before the topic's trending
Hashtag the revolution's not a Twitter war so stop pretending
Admit it you're just immature and condescending
Cause we've seen the shit before throwing fits when your with Donald Lemon
A common ending to any topic of discussion
You're involved with Obnoxious you gossip it's disgusting
Everybody's a nobody ’til proper introductions
Guess what nobody's bodying your knowledge and instruction
Honestly it's nothing but hang tough don't forfeit
Who am I kidding I just wanna bring up some more shit
You say stuff like you should thank us for all this
Fine thank you Kweli for bankrupting Rawkus
Thanks for generalizing when it generally serves you
Exhibit A I didn't know Remedy Urkel
You nerds will twist words and deflect in these circles
Scared to look in the mirror cause that reflection's eternal
Step in the lab with that aggression and spaz
I'll shit on you and wipe with the confederate flag
Go to Twitter for support the only weapon you have
But I don't care about those kids like Mos Def as a dad
Toe tagged if we battle you'll be dwelling on race
I'll smoke a blunt to the head you'll take an L to your face
Cause to me melanin's your least relevant trait
Before that there's petty pussy fragile selfish and fake
But wait you're revolutionary right those are just rhymes
Cause real revolutionaries fight on the Frontlines
So when it comes time for you to die true indeed
This tune will be played on boomboxes at your eulogy

[Chorus: Diabolic]
One, two, three
Rest in peace Talib Kweli
Crying like make it stop
That shit isn’t hiphop, you ho
