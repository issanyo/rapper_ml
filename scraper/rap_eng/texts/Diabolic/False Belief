Heaven's such a vicious lie
Only Satan's word can I rely
Even when I question f*ckin' honor
Turn my back in disgrace
Ask and you shall receive your gift
Devotion to evil must believe this
All the pleasures of this world
Must be hailed from within
Soul is gone for eternal faith
Prayed to God seems such a waste
Rituals have always prevailed
Given lust beyond this world
Sent a demon from his horde
His only aim is just destroy
Everything built that stands
Torn down, all that's left is man
Dedicate the being of forseeing
The future brings death to the deceiving
The unholy truth survives
In the blackened eyes
Weaken to the power, only to die
Offered in the face of God
False belief, false belief
