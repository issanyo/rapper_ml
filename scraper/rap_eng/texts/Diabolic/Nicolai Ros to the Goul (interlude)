Nicolai Ros to the goul, I come to country
Immigrant, obviously, idiot
I am from Czech Republic, we bust off real tech
I wanna' listen to hip-hop
Somebody recommend place called FatBeat
They give to me CD, "Thief & Liar"
Listen to it, now used as coaster for drink for Vodka

[Man 2 speaking]
Yo, yo you talkin' about Diabolic right now?

[Man 1 speaking]
Diabolic?

[Man 2 speaking]
Yo, let me tell you somethin'. I used to record that fuckin' kid
That kid used to come here, never paid me a fuckin' dollar

[Man 1 speaking]
Asshole

[Man 2 speaking]
The kid drank my fuckin' alcohol, he got the fuckin' dog drunk
And I'm pretty sure the kid stole my fuckin' headphones

[Man 1 speaking]
Piece of shit

[Man 2 speaking]
Let me catch that fuckin' kid

[Man 1 speaking]
I tell you, my country we catch thief, we alligator frenzy
That's what we do in country, champion spit-boss spitter
He think he spit, I spit better than him, he not on my level
