[Intro: Immortal Technique]
Oh, you motherfuckers thought it was over, huh?
Well, it's not, you didn't count on a fallen angel
Gettin' back into the grace of God and comin' after you
Y'all niggas ain't shit
Your producers ain't shit
Your fuckin' A&R ain't shit
I'll fuckin' wipe my ass with your demo deal
Yo, Diabolic, take this motherfucker's head off!

[Verse 1: Diabolic]
Go ahead and grip Glocks
I'll snap your trigger finger in six spots
You'll have to lip lock with hypodermic needles to lick shots
I'll watch you topple flat
Put away your writtens and holla back
Can't freestyle, you're screwed off the top, like bottle caps
Beneath the surface, I'm overheatin' your receivin' circuits
By unleashin' deeper verses than priests speak in churches
What you preach is worthless
Your worship defeat the purpose
Like President Bush takin' bullets for the Secret Service
Beyond what y'all fathom
I shit on cats and jaw tap 'em
Show no compassion, like havin' a straight-faced orgasm
Tour jack him, have his half-a-ten bitch suck my friend's dick
In the mean time, you can French kiss this clenched fist
Diabolic, a one-man brigade spreadin' cancer plague
Fist-fuckin' a pussy's face, holdin' a hand grenade
So if I catch you bluffin', faggot, you're less than nothin'
I just had to get that stress off my chest like breast reduction

[Verse 2: Immortal Technique]
You motherfuckers are nothin', you cannot harm me
I'll resurrect every aborted baby and start an army
Storm the planet, huntin' you down, â€˜cause I'm on a mission
To split your body into a billion one-celled organisms
Immortal Technique'll destroy your religion, you stupid bitch
You're faker than blue-eyed crackers nailed to a crucifix
I'm about to blow up, like NASA Challenger computer chips
Arsenic language transmitted revolutionarily
I'm like time itself: I'm gonna kill you inevitably
Chemically bomb you, fuck usin' a chrome piece!
I'm Illmatic, you won't make it home, like Jerome's niece
I'll sever your head diagonally for thinkin' of dissin' me
And then use your dead body to write my name in calligraphy
This puppet democracy brainwashed your psychology
So you're nothin' like diversity without equality
And your crew is full of more faggots than Greek mythology
Usin' numerology to count the people I sent to Heaven
Produces more digits than twenty-two divided by seven
You're like Kevin Spacey: your style is usually suspect
You never killed a cop, you not a motherfuckin' thug yet
Your mind is empty and spacious
Like the part of the brain that appreciates culture in a racist
Face it, you're too basic, you're never gonna make it
Like children walkin' through Antarctica, butt-naked
