[Hersemann/Malone]

All our futures once were foretold
First etched stone now carved flesh
Despite our frail human stock
We traverse the realms of death
With knowledge bestowed upon us
We proceed to forge our paths
Despite all the lies around us
We will dominate this quest!!
Subconscious strength
Deep inside
Will not accept
Cannot abide!!
Forever onward
Never relent
No forgiveness
No repent!!
Defeated legions
Lie behind
Their corpses stuffed
With their leader's minds!!
Holy symbols
Now ablaze
Like the congregation
Mindless slaves!!
Overtaking the realms of ignorance
Force feeding the spirits of simple minds
Kicking and screaming the fools are dragged
From -- the -- mines!
Our display, to show unending strength
Taught and reinforced since the birth of time
When will the maggots start to learn
We'll be here until the end of time!!
Defeated legions
Lie behind
Their corpses stuffed
With their leader's minds!!
Holy symbols
Now ablaze
Like the congregation
Mindless slaves!!
With resilience
The strength of steel
The attack proceeds
Through infinity!!
Now our dominance has been displayed
Trampled underfoot the mindless slaves
Learn by example -- we stand as one
With this knowledge now our quest is done
