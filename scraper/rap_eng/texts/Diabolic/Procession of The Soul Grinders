[Hersemann/Malone]

Perpetual
Limitless
Unending
Infinite
Everlasting
Never-stopping
Forever!!
Procession of the Soulgrinders!
Left unchecked
Collective thought
Led to guilt
No-self-will
Humanity's
Weakest links
Sympathy
And cognizance!
Unexplained
What causes a human to feel insane?
Influence surrounds
Yet all directions lead to pain
Mass hypnosis
Ceaseless scourge of rational thought
Unblinking idols
Gazing blankly at battles fought
The soulgrinders proceed!
