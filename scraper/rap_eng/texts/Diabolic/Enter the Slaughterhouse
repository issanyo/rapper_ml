(SKRIBBAL)
Welcome to the basement/Underground bass hits
Back to claim the throne and leave these cats faceless
Microphone psychotic/Spinning through your territory
Rippin' through ya flesh now ya death becomes my glory
Sick psychopathic/delirious, deranged
My infuriated pain stems from serious insane capablities
Never walk the street without hostility
Chills shift down my spine, Im goin on a killin spree
The minute that you turn/I attack without question
Transgression, leave you mutilated with infection
As the maggots crawl inside/I'm eatin you alive
Then chop you into pieces and take you for a drive
Depraved and deprived/Enslaved in the mind
Dump you in a lake and burn the rest of you inside
My catacomb/Where the microphone fiends for ya blood
I fiend to dump slugs, and let you bleed in the mud
Im a fiend

(DIABOLIC)
Im an abomination/A combination of god an satan
Under constant observation, testin a doctors patience
I need my head examined/so we tried operatin
Dropped the...??..dead/talk about complications
Now Im escapin, let the epidemic spread
Conversatin with the voices in a schitzofrenics head
Fuck the vinyl, why I was summoned from the other side
By a 105 witch doctors and now Ive come alive
With a dozen tribes of natives/Who feel justified
Scalpin pilgrims with the fuckin knives to cut their pumpkin pies
And Im gonna ride/Till i die or Im tried by twelve
Gettin knocked, left to rot in a cell by myself
Why the hell not/Im shell shocked like everybody else in this meltin pot
Wether sellin rock or stockin shells
So i gotta tell my story/But Im not a glory hound
Im pourin out my 40 oz for all my soldiers fallin down
