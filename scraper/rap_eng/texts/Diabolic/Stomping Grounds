[Hook: Diabolic]
I ain't in the club
Can't afford no bubbly
I ain't got shit
So you don't wanna fuck with me
Shit is poppin' now
Time to lock it down
And see a soldier
Leave his footprints in your stomping grounds

[Hook]

[Verse 1: Diabolic]
Birth of dominance
On some divide and conquer shit
Got so bent, I split Pangaea
Into seven continents

Before the tall travels
Went to war and stormed castles
Swinging swords in more battles
Than Snake Eyes and Storm Shadow

Explore Babel's Tower
So now I have the power
Causing scattered showers
Raining fire every half an hour

The seventh sign to ya
Fetter lines the best you'll find
I'll stand the test of time
And outrun it, so I'm ahead of mind
In times, I get to find
The devil's kind in God's likeness
Part righteous, hatin'
Makin' joints tight as arthritis
Bar fighter
Cauterizin' eyes with car lighters
And I don't see you nearin' me
So lyrically I'm farsighted

Born the dopest
More ferocious
Than a swarm of locusts
Or some poor and hopeless
Peasants with C-4 explosives
Feeling claustrophobic
I exceed your normal dosage
Giving formal notice
'Bolic never lost his focus

[Hook x2]

[Verse 2: Diabolic]
(Yo)
I plot to master lock
This pop culture aftershock
Move to Planet Rock
And have more props
On stage than Carrot Top
No glamor shots
On your Magnavox plasma screen
No ads in magazines
Just North Pole and tractor beams
Smack the battle scene
Shatter dreams, took the title
Raided club hater with Smoothe
And I still pushed the final

I think you're basic, ignoramus
I ain't big and famous
But I can take your greatest masterpiece
And fingerpaint it
Drink some tainted liquor
Give you my distinctive cadence
Then turn the tide
You'll burn alive
Like the English patient

My thoughts orbit Venus
You'll get torn to pieces
By an aborted fetus
Jesus had me born a genius
So will I need an orthopedist
Just to cure diseases
Now all I need is a crowbar
To get you off my penis
But I'm broke
And my budget couldn't afford some Reese's
That's why respect in this game's
Paying for my features

[Hook x2]

[Verse 3: Diabolic]
(Yo)
I swore allegiance
To this hip-hop
For shadowboxin'
And the Big Apple's rotten
So I only have one option

And that's to die sinnin'
Then take your lives grinnin'
Slide in and ring your necks
Like Burmese drops women
It's nine innings, game over
'Bolic dominates, wide awake
Violatin' while you hibernate
It's commonplace for me
To shake the Earth's tectonic plates
Open holes in the Empire State
And swallow fakes

Annihilate my competetion
In the top position
Shopliftin' a pot to piss in
From their mama's kitchen
That's how I'm livin'
So if and when disaster strikes
My appetite for destruction
Feeds me in the afterlife

'Cuz my satellites above my head
Can Google Earth
Something tells me what the government
Can do is worse
That's why I'm doin' dirt
Makin' sure my records spin
I feel it in my flesh and skin
This is where the end begins

[Hook x2]
