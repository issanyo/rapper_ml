[Verse 1:]

Yo, Long Island test sites, Suffolk's microchip children
While NASA will get site of the triple six building
It's built in, hustle or fall fast
Stick 'em to a modern caste system where cash the past wisdom
Fascism covered in coagulated blood
When aggravated thugs bless contaminated love
Nuttin' barricades the flooded drugs thru the populace
Politics producing hollow tips, induce apocalypse
Chew and swallow it, I'm chasing truth
But the JASON group stole exhibit A and erased the proof
Soldiers lace your boots, the anti-Christ seven signs
Next in line, so I manifest the stress defined
The architect's design kept your mind in confinement
Finding time to strip cloud nine's silver lining
But still we're climbing, a mountain of lies, most kids plummet
I reached Dit's Summit <--(?), only to take a piss from it

Chorus:

I've been falling, no one to help me up
Gone <--(?) for self, 'bout to self destruct
I felt corrupt, seekin' revelation
When I noticed, around every corner the devil's waiting
[2X]
