In the beginning
We fought to find
Our rightful place
Destined to reign supreme!!!
With desperate visions
We fight until death
And banishment of cursed souls!
This battle for survival
In eternal war!!!!
Ancestral blood of distant warriors
Flows through our veins
Ignite the white-hot flame
Desire burns, burns burns
Infinitely
Our blood boils with rage
Ignite the white-hot flame!!
With desperate visions
We fight until death
And banishment of cursed souls!
This battle for survival
In eternal war!!
Vengeance screams!!
The ally of strength
We beckon the call
To accelerate the demise
Enemies bloodied and maimed
Bleed, bleed, bleed
With hatred we spit on your corpse!!
No honor
Pathetic speck of vile existence
Despised even in death
Victorious we reign!!!
