[Verse 1]
[Diabolic]
The day that we died
Was on the lower East side
When I seen these three D.T.’s speed by
[Lou Cipher]
Still feeling the trees, the weed fly
My reaction slow while stashing bags of coke in my Levi’s
[Diabolic]
Three guys creeped from each side, tryna to spark me
I grabbed they car keys and snatched they Grand Marquis
Made it four blocks before some uniform cops
By a corner store stopped and licked off four shots
They ricocheted off the door lock—the tires exploded
The shot passed the gas tank—fire engulfed it
[Lou Cipher]
Digged out like we ran a track meet when the man attacked me
In his hands, some black heat with a plan to clap me
For covering a stand-off deadlock
They let Glocks spray and ‘Bolic got caught with a headshot
Had to revenge plot
Grabbed a gun from a dead cop
‘Til I felt something red-hot in my chest and my breath stopped

[Chorus x2]
Sometimes I wonder, “Do I deserve to live?”
“Am I gonna burn in hell for all the things I did?"

[Verse 2]
[Diabolic]
We had street cred.  How could we be dead?
I fell to the gates of Hell and seen the dog with three heads
[Lou Cipher]
Told the world to sit the fuck down on some Double Team shit
Expected Heaven, got Hell and had to come up with a scheme quick
[Diabolic]
So quick dipped and attacked the triple-6 throne
Cracked Satan's chin bone with a chunk of brimstone
[Lou Cipher]
Lou Cipher’s/Lucifer’s executioners approached from all the angles
But I used the Devil's horn to stab the fallen angel
[Diabolic]
The brawl was painful, but I had faith in Jesús
Prayed I could break loose and found an escape route
[Lou Cipher]
Atop a mountain of Satan's troops, in a burst of glory
If you heard the story, you'd know the power of purgatory
[Diabolic]
Escaped the hell-hole where the Devil sells souls
Saw Heaven's gate in the distance, and heard the bell toll
[Lou Cipher]
Celebrated with an L roll, and seemed to be straight
Ran toward God's light and seen St. Peter at the gate

[Chorus x2]
Sometimes I wonder, “Do I deserve to live?”
“Am I gonna burn in hell for all the things I did?"

[Verse 3]
[Diabolic]
We ran up screaming, "Open the gates of Heaven.”
He said, "You're not in the Book of Life and God don’t make exceptions."
[Lou Cipher]
I sprayed ether at St. Peter and hit the spot
While ‘Bolic broke an angel’s halo and tried to pick the lock
[Diabolic]
Soon as I opened it, an angel came and closed the shit—dead bolted it
So we were forced to climb over it
[Lou Cipher]
Jumped in Heaven, saw two angels unsuspecting
Ran their white robes and begun to blend in
[Diabolic]
But Moses noticed and exposed the hidden truth
We hid in the Garden of Eden, eating the forbidden fruit
[Lou Cipher]
Jehovah's two best soldiers lead the chase
They caught us and brought us before God to plead our case
[Diabolic]
I told our story
He moved, then stopped and said, "I’ll give back your human body if you fight the Illuminati."
[Lou Cipher]
Had no choice but to accept God's gift
So here we are resurrected on earth as prophets
