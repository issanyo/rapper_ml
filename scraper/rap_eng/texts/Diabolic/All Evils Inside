There's a void you can go
A region you don't know
Shadows waiting to please you
With pleasures and evil

You can perceive what you need
But be rigorous of greed
It's dangerous, unwilling
Some find it fulfilling

Abyss of depravity!

Don't go to the hole
The darkest of holes
You just might not know
What I'll harm is lurking

Because you are flirting
With menace unknown
You could come to your death
Shot blast to your head

Left for dead
Stripped of your life
The demons entice
Just may be sliced

If you get out alive
You played with your life
Until the next time
All evils inside!
