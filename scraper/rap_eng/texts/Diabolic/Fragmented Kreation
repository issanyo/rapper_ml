Evil from an inborn birth
A monster lives inside
An angel on exterior
A demon dwells alive
Subjected to the darkness
Propaganda glorified
Became a part of the dark world
Young at heart, evil then starts!
Behind the darkened eyes
No rhyme or reason
Influenced by religion
A wrath of devastation
Satan gives, Satan takes
To pull in all that he hates
To unleash upon the weak
