[Celph Titled]
Dump a body motherfucker
Evil Intentions
Celph Titled, Diabolic
C-Lance on the orchestra
Light the motherfucking torches up and scorch a fuck, let's go

I paint pictures in blood
Thats my art of war hobby
If it wasn’t for that, i’d be robbin’ stores prob’ly
But don’t think i won’t do it
Dipstick, ima purse neck bitches and keep their lipstick
So i can, put it on you and call you candyman
And the fifth time i say it
Ima murk you and your pansy fans
The block gon’ tear through your roca wear
Put this infrared dot on the back of your S. Carter’s
Ain’t nobody rock harder than this
Take a hoe out to dinner and I’m chargin’ the bitch
Your whole crew is corn huskers
Cuz beef you don’t handle
Celph Titled logo engraved on my guns on each handle
Animal floridian derelict slight nology delicate
Make your body a floating island for pelicans
We pulling heists homie the cops can’t stop us
Elvis imposter jumping out of helicopters

Verse2
Ain't no fake in the vein
Commercial rappers raping the game
I don’t take it in vein
Forsaken the flames
Start praising my name
Formaldehyde n sacred the same
Bringing hip hop back from the place that it came
Blazing the jane
Hazing the brain
Amazing insane
Strange days lacing the pain with jays and the caine
Special k in strains the strange
Chasing the change
Phasing my rain
Maintain and blazing devane
Throw you off thae mezzanine
Out to get the ghetti green
Douse your ass in ethylene
Light a match and let you scream
Slicing raps like jets your spleen
Life is fast and death is me
Suffice to blast and rest your cleats
Hype and rap the bed that you see

Verse3
Master of gore
Slash poor
Disaster with war
Hammer of thor damaging drawers
Cuz your grammar is poor
Cannibal corpse stabbing a whore glad bag gagged and dragged on the floor
After some more raps to restore

Verse 4
Fuck the world
I run the globe uncontrolled
Bout to go, out my brain
Like JFK's frontal lobe
My souls colder than the tundra or the southern pole
I hold court, and put a hundred holes through judges robes
Jehovah broke the mold when he built a statuesque villain that complexed the children
While they chill in bassinets
A rabid pit getting shot i will attack the vets
Until i snap their necks I’m the illest rapper yet
Ill peel your cap in less than seconds you’ve unlocked the beast
Gettin’ buckwild like Celph Titled when he shots the beats
King of the mountain counting bodies quarter top the peak
Burning more ganja than a rastah with a flonkin’ wreath
On Bolic’s streets the monsters feast when they spot the weak
N see the bitch in you like cube when common beefed
So yall should cease witness real be personified
When my performance shut ‘em down like seeing onyx live

Verse 5
This is hell hound
Hell bound hell raiser
Hell on earth
Gallagher with the hammer caliber make your melon burst
Selling sherm, well imbursed
Dwelling in a felons shirt
Another, nuiku who was due to do the devils work
Victims still reserved
Still my nerves
I could still reserve killer verses
In loose construse still reserves
Steal the stash steal the stash I’m stealing rap
Im hip hops special ops
Weapons cop the shotty
See your body ima let it drop
Fuck with us you better not
We’ll wreckon shot like demolition semi auto scripture sleepy hollows now your head is missing
Weapon visions better listen dead the henchmen
Spread the sickness like a rap script ima a mattress like a veteran
Never ending grewing streams like whenever sweaters did it ain
Or epidemic, so sick, get a medic, gettin’ redded
In a minute get beheaded with a leg get deaded
Your head gets shredded like a head of lettuce
