[Verse 1:]
>Me and ???? redneck skins ???< give birth to Zombieland
Uncle Sam's plan is to reprogram triple six politricks >???< worship microchips
Hurricanes and hollowtips Welcome in the Apocalypse
Military blood drips from the veins of Lady Liberty
The 33rd degree'll sickle into the ministry
The >Pope/poor??< pray for the death of me
Angels on my balcony protecting me with heavenly weaponry
Prop circles and hearses biblical verses








[Verse 2:]
Life is hard as ever I'm left with stressed emotion
Getting open like documents from Edward Snowden
Hearing Zombieland it's hot as the >Mugabe's sand??<
And war supporting oil tycoons and importing poppy plants
Body scams copying the Nazi plans and I be damn
If I don't fight through the crowd like hockey fans
Johnny Chan couldn't play the >ham and???< himself
Walkin dead fed

I stand in hell Devil's on the palace throne replacing Bill Cooper
With provocateurs like Alex Jones
And now we're home it's the illusion your born free and what I forsee goes beyond World War Z
You see the surface go beneath and see the purpose
See Police performing illegal searches like Secret Service
See this evil serpents we call Illuminati
Gimme drugs and turn a human body into a clueless zombie
