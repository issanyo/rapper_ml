Marked for banishment
Condemned in the eye
Inhabit bad karma
Deport desensitized!!
Do unto thy enemies
As they have done to you
Put them on a hit list
Curse them with illness
Promise doom and destruction
Their fate will do the rest
Burning candles rituals done
Their end has just begun!!!!
They tried to hold us back
Now we seige the assailant
The battle they cannot secure
Our triumph over obstacles
The greatest men are alone
Without suffering there's no wisdom
Ravage the night terror
Marked by the master!!!
Marked for banishment!!!
Righteous ones!!!
Victorious!!!
Overall!!!
Triumphant!!!
