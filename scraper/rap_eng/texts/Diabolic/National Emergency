"Fire one, back the fuck up.  Nigga smack that mothafucka.  Get your mind right mothafucka.  Can't believe this shit.  Who the fuck told you to talk man?  I'll smack you out of your dumbass."

Chorus - Diabolic:

National emergency, get your riot gear
Fuck the cops, fuck the world, we gettin' high in here
Get the party poppin', when it dies I appear
To bring this shit back to life, yo the time is near
[2X]

[Verse 1 - Diabolic:]

I've been skitzin' lately, driven crazy, a bit insane
By shady politicians kissin' babies like Lil' Wayne
Shit'll change all the pixles in your picture frame
Twist your brain, and leave visions of Jesus with a pistol aimed
We all kind of live the same read and god scroll
We both feed on steamin' hot coals leavin' pot holes
And God knows, I'll reap what I sow, the truth is unfair
The dude who moved in upstairs, is sayin' "who the fuck cares"
Fuck yeah, I drink to hide the pain, to think on higher planes
Teary eyed, the sky just rains fire, what a cryin' shame
Got the game in iron chains, I will not acquire fame
I will die in vain, like anybody's killed the vibal strain
I won't change, I'll do something drastic with a gun and blast it
At every frontin' faggot, New York rapper with a southern accent
This drunken bastard got suicidal tendencies
Survivin' mentally like I knew I'd die eventually

[Chorus]

[Verse 2 - Nickles:]

I'm 'bout to start a revolution, I'm introducing the kids of nussaince
Fuck the law, I'll raise a fire, tear the Constitution
And smash confusin' when I step inside the booth abusin'
I'll leave you oozin', it's proven doggie, my screws are loosin'
They want to lock me and drop me inside a institution
You couldn't stop me, I'm Rocky, homie there's no solution
There's no excuse, there ain't a thing about my life amusing
I'm not a human, I'm a super guy, an evil mutant
I got the power to steal on top of the tallest towers
Black skies made it rain, it's fuckin' fire showers
Now I'm back with the mac strapped in the Cadillac
Hear that click-clack, that's the beam aimed at your cateract
Fuckin' maniac, a little off in the brainiac
My life's fucked up, got me pill poppin' a Zaniac
So fuck the world 'cause we all gonna die in here
Let's get it poppin', everybody get your riot gear

[Chorus]

[Verse 3 - Pot Bull:]

It's a national emergency, I know who you are
I'm talkin' surgery, to remove your fuckin' memory card
You mentally scarred, I'm livin' like it's meant to be hard
I wake up early in the morning feelin' Federally charged
I'm heavilly armed, 'cause I don't really trust these bad souls
You assholes, should've looked past the cash flow
My sample, but naturally you shook and trample
My ammo's tucked in these crooks and castles
We spill it out into the street, body your face kid
The real shit, you can't even try to fake it
You naked, strip you like a bitch, it's payment
The livest mothafuckas underneath this pavement
We back again, hackin' up these tracks like F Crew
I'll hex you, step aside or Nickles will bless you
It's Pot Bull, and I don't give a fuck about your lifestyle
Lights out, everybody wild the fuck out

[Chorus]
