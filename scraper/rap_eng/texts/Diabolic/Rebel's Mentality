Haha
Eternal Love, Diabolic
Third World Order, Rebel Army
It’s all mental

[Refrain:Eternal Love]
This is the rebels mentality, always in the zone
Ready to go hand and hand, yo lock and load
This is the rebels mentality
Fight for freedom in my home
Don’t destroy my people and the babies getting grown
This is the rebels mentality

[Verse 1:Eternal Love]

Morphing? necklace around my neck and tomahawks in my hands
I calmly? sang that when I’m speaking Korean
They give the hurt, when they’re tearing thru your skin
As if you’re a wall safe, and I’m breaking in
I’ll grab your mind and I take it, cold with spin?
Take you to the end of time just to re-begin
They look at me and say that I’m walking in sin
But I go to war so they don’t have to, and I fight to win
I can see it and do it, but I explain it though
I can see thru the matrix and can re-arrange the code
So fuck what they doing out of Bohemian Groves
I’m like the full metal, I don’t need to use any circles
I’m a front line general, re-arranging the chemicals
In your city road, giving the third a bed of flow?
So you can open up your eyes
Or we can break the oppresion on you they hold

[Refrain:Eternal Love]

This is the rebels mentality, always in the zone
Ready to go hand and hand, yo lock and load
This is the rebels mentality
Fight for freedom in my home
Don’t destroy my people and the babies gettin’ grown
This is the rebels mentality
Take it to a higher state, this is guerilla warfare, doing whatever it takes
This is the rebels mentality
Always raising the stakes, ’cause we’re always makin’ moves to change this place
The rebels mentality

[Verse 2:Diabolic]

Fuck cops, go to war with police
And force them to eat their guns when their fortress is breached
Attacking like it’s Normady and we’re stormin’ the beach
Afterwards Bolic’s going for the corporate elite
Kick the door with my feet ’till I break it in half
Lawn mower blades spinning for the snakes in the grass
40′s and 10′s, fuck the champagne in your glass
Son of a gun, pap’s told me aim and just blast
Ain’t chasing the cash and spitting vaginal raps
I just make songs based on actual facts
Tearing thru your flesh, where the fuck my cannibals at
Slaughter sheep with the wolves in this animals pact
Attacking the track, everytime I go in the booth
And inspiration when moral is getting low in the troops
Told the recruits, I would rather choke from a noose
Then accept being lied to, so I’m exposing the truth

[Refrain]
