[Verse 1:]

I don't want to battle, I'd rather curse at your wife
I ain't trying to win, I'm trying to fuck up your personal life
When the block in a daze, your wife's watching amazed
So I dug her back out like I was robbing a grave
Stay bent, brain drenched by the haze stench
Strugglin' to make sense of where my day went (what)
Time to pay rent, duckin' the landlord
Fuckin' some tramp raw on the trunk of my man's Ford
Self destructive, smokin' l's in public
I fell in love with the feeling of yelling fuck it (Fuck it!)
Raising hell above it, without a Glock to pull
I'm greedy, I'll run ya pockets when my pockets full
Unstoppable force on an obstacle course
Lookin' at your chain for a few rocks that fell off
Could be a good fight 'till I land a hook right (blah)
And draw blood like police sketches of Sug Knight

Chorus:

I'm not like you, y'all could never relate
You couldn't handle half of the pressure and weight
I'm not like you, y'all pretenders and fakes
Real recognize real, I don't remember your face
[2X]

[Verse 2:]

Yo I may be wrong, at war with my baby's mom
But I'm way beyond giving a fuck what ladies want
Please believe it, there's no deceitful secret
I'm too raw, the evil genius and his people seen it
Dodging cop stations on blocks you're not safe in
Passing thru telling camera crews to stop taping
I may slap the same cats who watch hating
Couldn't get work if the spot had job placement (haha)
Chasing the dough you stash, approaching fast
Smoking hash, ride or die, hope to crash
Grab your throat to slash an open gash
Try holding on with both your arms broke in half
Jehovah's wrath, God gave for pap's glazed <--(?)
Shockwave with a buck fifty ox blade
And the cascades driving thru police blockades
Escaping the heat, takin' a leak on a cop's grave

[Chorus]

[Verse 3:]

Yo I make shit happen, so just in case shit happens
I can laugh it off like fuck it shit happens
Bitch slappin' your jaw to six fragments
Click clackin' at your team screaming QUIT RAPPING!!
Crooks countin' they wealth, while Sug's shoutin' for help
When I do dirt like the ?? lookin' out for himself
More controversial, I'll do your kid's momma dirty
Cause drama worthy if you askin' god for mercy
Your worst nightmare, rockin' the venue
Sellin' you a dream, plottin' against you
The razor cut your face 'till it stapled shut
Get dropped and be the next flop the label fucks
Rest assured, everything I said is raw
Acting foul, won't crack a smile unless it's yours
Ride with me, blazin' five fifties
Top of the world, so if I fall I'm takin' the sky with me

[Chorus]

Haha.  I'm not like you.  Go sit on a cucumber and spin.  Motherfucker
Diabolic, Triple Optix, Brooklyn Academy
Hahaha.  Game over.  Holla back you little bitches
