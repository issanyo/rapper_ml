Chorus:
I solemnly swear that I will stay raw (raw)
So if you love hip-hop I’m the savior that you pray for (for)
I ain’t here to bring it back I’m living proof
That’ll show you how a liar and a thief can be the truth (truth)
[2X]

[Verse 1:]

Yo, I’ll burn an ounce of the best, left with doubts left in my stress
Speaking from the heart like there’s a second mouth on my chest
I really must confess I’ve been thinking who I might murder
And stoppin’ me is like Ike Turner being a civil rights worker
I’m Dr. Jekyll and the twisted side of Mr. Hyde
I swim beside the sharks but got bigger fish to fry
Don’t matter if I live or die, I’m here and I’mma fight you
And the only place that I’m getting punched in is the mic booth
Aight dude, you know the stuff I’m dropping is hot
Shit is fire like the human torch coppin’ a squat
It’s the only option I got so I’mma rape the industry
Makin’ history and ain’t nobody saying shit to me
Defeat is agony, I’m thrilled by the taste of victory
Out in the Boondocks, boombox playing symphony
I still exist in rap even when I’m sitting back
The only living cat with a fan base off a hidden track

[Chorus]

[Verse 2:]

You know it’s not hype, I’ve been god-like when I rock mics
Since gunmen took Pac’s life in Vegas at a stop light
Way before Suge Knight had cops aiming 4’s
Off duty shooting Big leaving the Soul Train Awards
And later on I came across my own fatal flaws
When I shit where I eat and wipe my ass with the table cloth
I sprayed the boss and I’mma take his turf for paper work
I’m an angel’s birth intertwined with an ancient curse
And to make it worse these kids buy the records we drop
An excessively hot recipe, I’ll never be stopped
You could have my mind shackled and penitentiaries locked
I’ll eventually pop the sheriff with the deputy’s Glock
My shock values ten times the cost of pure lightning
I just lose it off the top like Lucy Liu sword fighting
When it comes to raw writing, Bolic’s a born titan
To be completely honest I wish there were more like him

[Chorus]

[Verse 3:]

Yo, I came to a fork in the road, hauling straight and swerve
Stole an ancient language and escaped, I got a way with words
I give the kids who love hip-hop what they deserve
And a little something me, myself, and I can break in thirds
Could say a verse you wish you thought of but didn’t think
While I sit and drink and spit some pink vomit in my kitchen sink
Merciless as Ming, clenched fist, kiss the ring
The vicious king living off beer and chicken wings
I mountain climbed to get here, like next year is our time
Now it’s mine, a chance to show these peasants how to rhyme
Survival of the fittest, Bolic’s so prepared
King of the jungle, throwing solar flares at a polar bear
Lion’s pride, eye of the tiger, coldest stare
And some drunk thoughts on my front porch in a folding chair
Drinkin’ vodka, tryin’ to do my thing and prosper
‘Till the fat lady singin’ opera while I finger pop her
It’s over bring the doctor, referee stop the fight
Bolic’s nice at the bar, throwing chairs like Bobby Knight
I body mics, but they won’t play my cleanest version
‘Cause I ain’t a people person and rotation’s pre-determined
To be for certain, I’ll get even with these evil serpents
When they girl’s penis slurping, gaggin’ like bulimics purging
I’m a genius working, leaving pussies bleeding worse than
A screaming virgin with a deep insertion between her curtains

[Chorus]
