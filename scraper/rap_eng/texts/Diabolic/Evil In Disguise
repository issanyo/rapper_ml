Evil!!
A different breed of animal
Somewhere driven by death
Every breath is dead air
Leaving millions in despair
A gift that no one can believe
Seventy two virgins, their motive to kill
To spend eternity in bliss
All they gave was one last wish
Cunning and deceptive
They had a master plan
Years in the making
To kill as many as they can
Evil in disguise
Evil from the skies
Mission from the master
The end is coming faster
The hate will never stop
For those who avenge us
Mentality of carnage
Offered to their kind
Ancient hatred destroyed
Future hatred deployed
Ancient hatred destroyed
Future hatred deployed
