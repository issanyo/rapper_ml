[Shitting] "Thank god"

This is what you get when you get two of the fattest pieces of shit to walk this planet (right)
Yo Bolic, (uh-huh), You’re a piece of shit (damn right), I’m a piece of shit (yeah), So it’s only right we drop some shit (ha ha), You know, diarrhea style on the game
Tell ‘em something
Let’s go

[Verse 1:Grimlock]

So who ever wanted to bring it but know I’m dumbing it with it
You’re ain’t about shit, hold your mouth put a sock in and zip it
‘Cause this year got bitches wanting a dilly to ride to
As I give them the eye, then come hit it and slide
Without giving a bye, lock is the code, he's bad to the bone like osteoporosis
You ain’t got balls to bring it to Grim, ’cause I’ve got jewels
Plus some crack in the flesh like wrinkly skin
I’m sippin’ the gin, drink ’till I throw up
Don’t like switchin’ the flow up, stop the bitchin’ and roll up
You’re not with it then so what, it’s for me, I’ll do this
I’ll give less than two shits what you and your crew thinks
Tryin’ to stain my name, I’ma be here forever
I run it cause I’m signing cats while I’m reigning the game
I ain’t changed, I’m the same from the last appearance
Tryin’ to make a profit like Nostradamus' parents

Chorus:

So throw it a beat, then I’ma prove the way we flowing this heat
But what do ya know, it’s the asshole & a creep
Grimlock, Diabolic, staying well connected
From US to UK we staying well respected
[2X]

[Verse 2:Diabolic]

Yo, I’ve been a heartless heathen since pap’s discarded semen
Mom felt me kick, her belly split, started leaking
I started breathing, parted seas, and marked the beast
And inspired skies to fall, sold the stars to demons
The reason these cops be switchin’ apparel
Lockin' the street, cockin’ the heat, like they dicks in a barrel
It’s holocaust when I set the drama off
Tossing tomahawks with a force of a bomb Osama launched
Lock your doors, I’ll release the Kraken
And turn feast to famine, leaving murder scenes police examine
Squeeze a cannon and bust just to prove it
I’ll lose my cool, but I was never cool enough to lose it
Undisputed, your spine will get crushed
Ain’t no big deal like Guerilla Black signing with Puff
Eyeing your slut, tryin’ to nut half the night
Sticking more virgins than terrorist in the afterlife

[Hook]

[Verse 3:Grimlock]

All I need is cash and a gat, with tight cash, half a gallon of Jack
I’m sick of these cats claiming what’s in back of they act
You carrying gats, please, taking your laptop on holidays
The only way that you’d be packing a mac
I’m the shit, you cats are just a fart and a limp
With stones in your scrotum you can't come harder than this
So tell a friend, tell a foe, that I’m ready to blow
‘Cause like fat gals(?) with tampax, I’m heavy with flow

[Verse 4:Diabolic]

Yo I’m ready to go
I won’t let your propaganda stop me from dropping grammar
‘Til coppers lock the slammer
I’m the kid like, I’d rather fist fight than cock the hammer
I react like Dr. Banner zoning off on lots of gamma
You wouldn’t like me when I’m getting a little angry
So get off my dick, y'all just talking shit like Mr. Hankey
Grimlock and Diabolic expose you to violence
Screaming on you when they ask for a moment of silence

[Hook]

Haha, fucking bloody wanker
I’ll have you wife up the duff
Stick her in the gary glitter
You heard
Hahaha
Fuck out of here
Foul Play bitch
Grimlock, Colony, all that
