[Verse 1: Diabolic]
Seems clear as Belvedere: ‘Bolic’s a mutated monster
All the water making up his body's been replaced with vodka
Plus I blaze the ganja, add the two, do the math equation
The world revolves around me like the sun's gravitation
Now shots of Jack are making everybody aggravatin’
I'mma snap and slam you on your back so hard you crack the pavement
Captivating mastermind, back with an axe to grind
I'll crack this hatchet's pine handle off in a rapper's spine
Cops come and clap the nine, but couldn't stop the violence here
With flying tear gas grenades, barricades and riot gear
Pioneers arriving, tryna steer clear when snakes approach
They wouldn't have my back with me in a rear naked choke
I hate to boast, but what the fuck you gonna do to 'Bolic? Please
I'm bloodthirsty, a chupacabra feeds at supersonic speeds
All you humans gotta heed the warning on the caution sign
Let's play connect the dots, this is where I draw the line

[Verse 2: Danegurous]
Here's a mass diversion 30 fucking gats is burstin'
‘Bolic pass the bourbon; alcoholics smashin' virgins
Rebels smackin' sermons, sparkin' blunts, and laugh in churches
Kill the rats and vermin; fuck ya moms and snatchin' purses
I'm the baddest person back to give you active service
Blast the fifth I'm strapped insurgents, guns ablaze we're a divergence
Only classic verses, verses only scratch the surface
I'm a natural - you just cut and paste like plastic surgeons
Usually I prelude, my eulogy on page 2
I'll turn your face blue, like E.T.’s in spacesuits
It's Rap's Jé-sus, sluggin' down the Grey Goose
80 Proof, spittin' venom like a recluse
Slay dudes, use his skin to make boots
Moving then I break truce, rule the land with eight goons
Great news, I'm 22 with attitude
.22’s will clap at you, plenty goons’ll laugh at fools

[Verse 3: Diabolic]
I broke the mold for lunatics, by throwing bows like Ludacris
Till the blood from your broken nose overflows your uterus
Pussy, hug your crucifix, pray to any God you wish
Then find out, this is my world, & he does not exist
Now find the nearest monolith or building in your metropolis
That's too high to survive the fall & jump off the top of it
This is the apocalypse, head for the hills, seek higher ground
I have now open the flood gates from the Long Island sound
Then we're Carolina bound, reaching the eastern seaboard
With the speed in G4s, with the debris released by C4
Knocking at your screen door, exploding on the fucking scene
Like suicide bombers on porn sets getting double teamed
It isn't always what it seems, I love to plot hustle schemes
Deeper than sea levels where the pressure crushes submarines
All the talent in the world, only way I'm touching C.R.E.M.E
Is rocking skinny custom jeans tight enough to rupture spleens
Fuck that, just pass the chronic, or it'll be as catastrophic
As atomic mass of rockets crashing with a passing comet
Now get it through your thick skull & see the darker half of Bolic
Perform Chinese water torture with Sulfuric acid droppings

[Verse 4: Danegurous]
Lyrical assassination, feel his lash of laceration, classic rap for half the nation, slap and dab a pact with Satan
They say I'm basket casing, something like a Master Mason
Faded off this hash I'm craving, stated like an Affidavit
Dangerous, diabolical, diabolical, dangerous
Deranged and abominable, your abdominals will take six
The stainless is probable, philosophical cadence
Biological shape-shift, my tongues swallowing spaceships
I'm Violating your ordinates, annihilating your co-ordinates
Highest graded performance, mind was raised with the orbits
Ready with the weed I'm smoking, Henny gives me keys to open
Up my fucking hemoglobin, colder than the deepest ocean
Now the beast is roaming, breathing with the demons omen
Flowing 'til I keep a motion sickness, now I need a Motrin
I'm a spit machine, I cripple knees like Triple C's
He's like six marines, the pistol beams like Mister Clean
A deadly sick disease, a different strain, a different breed
I've always been a beast, syllables been a breeze
You snitching like a Lil' Cease, I'm the missiles in the Middle East
Crystals what my writtens eat, a bigger piece of brittle me
Find out where your sister sleeps, and give the niece a nipple squeeze
Swallow down my dick, o please, and blow that shit to smithereens
