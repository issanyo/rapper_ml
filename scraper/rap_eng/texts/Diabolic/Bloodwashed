Where is the sacred swine
Whose blood can cleanse my brainwashed mind
Cleansed of all the good
Which plagues the earth with lying words
Let me be bloodwashed clean
Of holy's bright white light sheen
Give me back my natural being
Born of darkness, things unseen
Let me be bloodwashed clean
Of holy's bright white light sheen
Bloodwashed clean!
Of holy's bright white light sheen!
Who with nature is the beast
Who with nature is the feast
I serve Satan, he is truth
Served by Satan's split hoof
Bloodwash is what the world needs
F*ck the goodness
F*ck the peace
Serve the goat, for he is truth
Submit to nature calling you
Don't be ashamed of murderous thoughts
For murder is what we're taught
These righteous f*cks who think they're saved
Their souls be doomed to wretched graves
Bloodwashed clean, I am evolved
Nothing else will be allowed
Hear these words of f*ckin' mine
Blood of swine!!
