Ancient witchery an evil sorcerer
Supernatural powers brings life's death
The devil's cohort a chilling specter
She is a shadow that is out for blood
Beautiful deadly she's the night
Practices of black infanticide
Orgies of unearthly acts
Is the nightmare of the human mind
A goddess figure a divine force
Ritual incantations brought forth
Possess powers of divination
A mortal vision of the forbidden
Soars to nocturnal gatherings
Face to face with Satan's sister
Worship the ensemble of the witch
Lucifer appears to partake in lust
For those who condemn evil
The would torture to confession
Found guilty of witchcraft
Burn Witch
Burn Witch
Burn Witch
Burn to f*cking Death
