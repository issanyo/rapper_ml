Grinding out evil emotion
Murder is death envisioned in devotion
Criminal mind committed daily
Sentenced to their thoughts deadly
Death is all death can do
Final judgment I'll call through
Evil gives to the demise
The essence of a forgotten soul
The great dying, Loss of God
Dissipate, The evil grows
Through the destroyed world that ends
The efforts of unknowing fools
Bless the wretched herds of Christians
With a bath unholy water
Cleanse them all of unholy thoughts
Deprogram everything they're taught
Slave of God, Lost souls
Transform into blasphemy!
Once a begotten son
Only to question faith
Keep the soul forever
Burning down heaven's gates!
