"Yeah.  Look at you, like life's a task for you.  You's was the one who's supposed to help me pass it, but you fronted like the rest of 'em so, I don't know what to tell you.  But whatever."

[Verse 1:]
I remember the first time I saw ya
You was a dime I was too shy to talk to
I declined the offer, it wouldn't happen twice
Soon as you saw the appetite and fire in my eyes
And grab the mic, you had to have the life
But couldn't take the sacrifice
So you would sabatoge me with your bad advice
Acting like you could never be wrong
Could question me on what I did
But when it's you your memory's gone
Six months together you're never laughin'
You stay gettin' mad, and we would fuck to forget it ever happened (I hate you)
'Till those early morning visits, resulted in morning sickness
And we both agreed, no abortion clinic
Nine months in a New Yorker's minute
I saw ya cross the limit, start a war and put my daughter in it
Always pushing buttons but you look disgusting
Telling my daughter her father's good for nothing (your father ain't shit)
So we both know I had to leave
Then you take the fact that we have a seed, and throw it back at me (just take it)
Automatically became vandictive
Had to see pain inflicted, everytime I came to visit
And you'll see when she fights you (sit down!)
Cause when you get spiteful, and fuck with me, you're fuckin' up her life too
And she's what god sent me for
So I pray you bless me lord, cause it's not about us anymore

Chorus:

It's not about you and me
What the fuck is it gonna take to make you see
(It's not about you, not about you)
[2X]

[Verse 2:]
I quit putting up with you, realized I couldn't fuck with you
Nothing I did was ever good enough for you
That's the truth and you know it
So stop the confusion and focus or Shayna's future is hopeless
You know this shit is trifle, that's why I grip the Bible
Knowing our daughters caught in a vicious cycle
I fight through deep depression, you're defeating a season veteran
How can I win, my seed's the weapon
You never wore my shoes, left for the courts to choose
I gotta gamble something I can't afford lose
It's like living is worthless till I invisioned a purpose
What you did, I didn't deserve it
Wasn't perfect, but I tried my best
You'd collide, apply the stress, I was blind thinking time's the test
But there's no way I'm your soul mate
That's like Nicole Brown and OJ's marriage being okay
It's too much trouble to see through
I hustle to feed you, you look down at me, I crumble beneath you
Bitch, you're immature, mad at me cause you were thin before
Gained some weight and got insecure
I look above for help, thru sickness plus the health
But how can I love you when you don't love yourself
I'm without a clue (I'm the best thing you got), but I know now it's true
Our daughter's the only good thing that ever came out of you

[Chorus]
