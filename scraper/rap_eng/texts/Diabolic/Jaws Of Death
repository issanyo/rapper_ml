Jaws of death hammering down
Killing is the way i live
Seriously taking life regrets
Doing Satan's will at best
F*ck God
F*ck Christ
Hoathe Satani!!!
The slaughters have not been found
Until they find the dead i killed
I defeat God and make my own
Spend eternity in hell
Prepare for the great battle
Watch his weak children die
To serve in heaven no longer
Leaving victims for dead
One crushed with deadly force
One beaten with blunt trauma
One hung, gutted from within
Deserve to die for their ways
Don;t need to live another day
Once gone forever forgotten
Left for dead begin to rotten
He came back to have his way
Life or death a trade with evil
On a path of destruction
Innocent people gone forever
Met a mad man out for pleasure
