Godless lifeless outcast
Alone in darkness I live
Stripped of all emotion
All I feel is nothingness
To live is a murder of thyself
Do you like to see death
Destroy the dreams of faces
Power of Satan in my hands
I am God I make demands
To die would be a blessing
Second from karma's fate
Outcome is evil hate
To end the lives of countless
A sorry existence lies ahead
For those who die first
It will cleanse my thirst
Fulfill my need to kill
From a deviant demon
The conquest has been won
The time has come to count the dead
For those who don't belong
From all the pain inflicted
Now it's time to die
Never know the reason why
Made their lives a living hell
They will never be the same
From my twisted killing game
As I descend deeper
Kill myself to the keeper
Satan!!!
