[General Zod - Superman II]

Yes, today begins a new order. Your lands, your possessions
Your very lives will be gladly be given in tribute to me
In return for your obedience, you will enjoy my generous protection
In other words, you will be allowed to live

[Verse 1]

Yo
Freedoms been overthrown by Skull and Bone, scroll and key
Lunatics, upside down crucifix on their rosary
It's the home of the brave, land of the supposed free
And Trilateral Commission expeditions overseas
Opposing me is a socially accepted secret known to me
The Jason Group mistakes the truth as its golden fleece
Am I supposed to believe masons who have a mixture
Of Satan and Catholic scripture, traded some gas to Hitler?
Should I believe when your forefather's Jack the Ripper?
And you worship statues in the forest and practice Wicca
I seen it unfold, summer season, reading a scroll
Translating masons speaking in code at Bohemian Grove
Prince Bernard of the Netherlands left some evidence
And the Bilderberg chose our presidents ever since
Veteran Illuminati invaded the Scottish Rite
Denounced god and Christ, worshiped man, and forgot the light
So I got to fight, cause I don't care how it sounds
The CIA planted C4 to bring the towers down
Planes hit, a weapon's born tracking us with Echelon
When a video exists of a missile hitting the pentagon
What a masterpiece, the past repeats, it's never gone
In daddy's footsteps junior re-enacts Desert Storm
Like let's get it on, act righteous, cause a fast crisis
Double gas prices and blame the fact we tax-hyped it
But observing optics can see through a vermin's logic
To just turn a profit and fatten Halliburton's pockets
Making Satan's fire lakes out a higher place
So this time I break, there's only so much I can take

[Hook x2]

Here's the truth, we the people have been seeing your attempts
And realized we the ones you declared war against
Here's the truth, I refuse to have you controlling me
With my faith in a bunch of snakes I just don't believe

[Verse 2]

The holy Roman crown is sacred and it seems the House of David
Left Black Nobility and Jesus somehow related
Black don't refer to the color of these cowards faces
Their powder pasted skin makes them the proudest racists
Illuminated lineage on lonely chromosomes
Known for seeking the return of the holy Roman throne
Committee of 300 call the shots close to home
Tapping in your mobile phones, matching up your vocal tones
It's your darkest belief, started with Harvard's elite
And Yale's fraternal orders marketing the mark of the beast
Deceiving as a demon playing the part of a priest
Habsburgs causing famine while we starve in the streets
Old School psychology basing fate on numerology
The newest colony and Lucifer's future prophecy
In aristocracy with souls in the devil's hands
And architecture plans, city streets designed as pentagrams
Hidden cams on every inch of this blessed land
A Verichip GPS attached to your genetic strands
But I'll be damned if I allow some coward to drown me
In the powers he proudly learned from Alister Crowley
Cause outta my county on the turnpike, word life
There's Nazi propaganda promoting Bush's Third Reich
Turn right at the left wing and find these cult leaders
Then expose FEMA before you take The Fall like Colt Seavers
No Geneva Convention peace treaty will be safe
When the elite make a one world government police state
I know y'all relate and even I hope I'm wrong
But I know I'm not, cause I know what the fuck is going on

[Hook x2]
