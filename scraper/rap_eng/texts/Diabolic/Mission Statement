[Verse 1:]
I'm your worst nightmare, I spit the shit you're dreaming of
Dope as intravenous drugs flooding River Phoenix blood
Building from the ground up, 'til I'm in the suite above
Buzzed, twisting greener bud than Wiz Khalifa does
See I ain't rhyming 'bout the diamond rings and flashy cars
Finer things than caviar, I just bring it as we are
And it got me thinkin' that the bar's been raised to mount position
With the weight and pounds I'm lifting barely makes an ounce of difference
Still fans play it loud, they say I make 'em proud to listen
They use it to escape like tunnels breaking out of prison
And they relate cause life's a bitch who knows her way around my kitchen
But wouldn't give me cake with flour and baking powder mixed in
Bank account's deficient, withdrew and overdraft
Can't afford to see the sky go from blue to overcast
So I use emotion as fuel, and spew explosive gas
Like a supernova blast coming through your phonograph..

[Verse 2:]
I choose to go a path that don't meet the status-quo
Chose to be an average-Joe, earn my keep and stack some dough
I chose to speak the truth, cause the people had to know
And they told me go to hell with the demons trapped below
They said hip-hop was dead, they confirmed it as deceased
'Till I reached out the casket through the dirt and grabbed their feet
So I could pull them underground, where verses smash the beat
And every person that meet is vermin turning savage beast
My work's a masterpiece, think not it's all the same
At least Iâ€™ve got in all the Janes for me,to shop at malls in Maine
Watchin' y'all drop the ball from atop the Hall of Fame
Then just stop and call the game like these drops of falling rain
Yo it's not my fault the pain's too much for angels on your shoulder
Their inner demons represent my name up on a poster
Sean came a long way, now he's way beyond the culture
An abomination spawn from the greatest song composers..

[Verse 3:]
I'll napalm your soldiers, I'll spray a loaded Glock
I'm not like these people, I embrace the culture shock
I'll celebrate the day my foes are layed below to rot
And chase Patron with shots of Jack straight and smoke some pot
Got the same approach with cops 'till they raid the local spots
Or invade my home with SWAT and snipers aim from overtop
That's not cool anymore, they say the game is going Pop
Rap about playin' beer pong with a case of Rolling Rock
I'm like fuck that, to me it'll always be the golden age
Skills matter, and ill rappers like me control the stage
Releasing flows and waves leaving people so amazed
They bend over backwards, their calf muscles reach their shoulder blades
From beneath the overpaid, where it's not commercialized
'Bolic drops the certified fire, watch him burn alive
I will lock it worldwide, hip-hop will turn the tides
And whoever fuckin' doubted me, y'all are first to die..
