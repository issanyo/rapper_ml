Haha.  This is feel good music right here man (yeah it is).  Johnny Vegas you played your cards right on this one homie.  I'm just tryin' to make y'all feel good with this here (feel right).  I really am, I'm serious (uh-huh).  This is uplifting music.  Na, wait a minute fuck y'all (yeah fuck y'all)

[Verse 1:]

I shoot up the needle breaks, got deceitful traits
At the last supper, stealing food off people's plates
Dodging thieves and jakes for this cheese I chase
The cool villain, sellin' school children weed I lased
Bolic needs his space, so he'd appreciate
If the population of New York would gladly leave the state
I'm don't believe in faith, I believe that Jesus H
Left me here phening, to scream in a devil's face
So my words come to life when I tour in hell
I don't write, my rhymes they go record themselves
Got a mind of their own, and some organ sells
They plot against me, they open the trap door, I fell
Hit rock bottom, now I got problems, no solution
Money talks, speaking in tongues, it's so confusing
No conclusion, drink away the soul pollution
Black out on Black House smokin' dro then puke it

Chorus:

I'm a asshole when I'm walking the streets
Sayin' fuck cops while they walkin' the beat
And I'll be there, 'till I'm in a coffin deceased
So watch what the fuck you say when you're talkin' to me
[2X]

[Verse 2:]

Yo I'm the pure demon with door keys and the four seasons
Force feeding your whore semen 'till the score's even
Before breathing I opened my two eyeballs
Reached for the stars and made your blue skies fall
Ain't my fault my brain just came apart
I'm tryin' to keep it together like the game on Change Your Heart
You play the part, I ain't in the same regards
I'm in the hood lace, foot race, with a st. benard
Got a paper to chase but it made an escape
So I'm raising the stakes, takin' combinations from safes
Agents and Jakes watchin' every single movement
So Bolic keep an eye out like that singer Houston
I stick to boozin', it makes things confusing
Drinkin', puking, porn, and the diamond rings I'm boosting
Promoting violence, just praying I'll reach
I'm not just an asshole, I'm an inspirational speaker

Haha
Fuck y'all

[Chorus]

[Verse 3:]

Yo, I'm close to the edge, the next man is over it
Got wifey pushing buttons like Def Jams' promoting it
So I throw the dick ten <--(?) and hope this seems possible
Holding a heartbeat (or hard beat), and the heartbeat's optional
I'm chuggin' Belvedere knowing hell is here
When I battle Satan, an image of myself appears
I'm like fuck it, two dutches and a twelve of beer
'Cause either you just shit yourself, or I can smell the fear
So tell these queers who claim to clap and shoot
They got me loosing my patience like a mal-practice suit
I booby trap the booth to see four so when the door close
I'll separate your limbs from your torso
Made your whore go to some distinctive doctor
She complained how I drew blood when I finger popped her
I'm the type to wipe my ass with the best you did
I'm ready to die, so why the fuck would I let you live

[Chorus]
