[Verse 1 (iCon The Mic King)]
In an instance, watch your life race before your eyes
A serial murder's verbalist, rapin' the baseline
My mind's a cancer effect, yours is a tumor that's renin
Not effective unless in a delusionary state of mind
Hallucinogenic or a heroin-induced high
Times are pathetic, emcees battle (lose), and blame it on they high
I'm zanier, [?] until my cranium bust
My notebook is equipped with a titanium crust
Complainin' too much results in brains being mangled and such
I angrily lunge and leave your body covered in angel dust
Containment's a must and you faggots get anally fucked
I'm an alien, but, that's what life in entertainment does
Started with big-dog crimes, perfect storms outshine
Fuck a [?] out your mouth time
My verses are [?]
You rather have me snatchin' purses on the street?
My [?] purses for ransom, then blackmail
I inhale 'til my trachea begins to feel like nails
Cut off the royal figurehead, so I can exhale
Fly through the galaxy at lightspeed on a [?]
[?] to battle me, my casualties are jail [?]
Incarcerate niggas whose bars are great, and rhyme hard
Times is hard, my whole squad has defined yours

[Verse 2 (Taboo)]
You stand as my opposition, you must be out your brain
You a wasted thought, should've been busted down a shower drain
I could kill it, if raps were an accordion
You couldn't kill it if you brought your [?]
You should admit your flaws, son you wish you raw
That's why I throw lines for you to bite like fishin' rods
Double negativity, sees through your vague image
Via craved mimic [?] followed by a plague of misery
I pity the fool that rhyme pitiful
Your contacts has no depth like kiddie pools
All your threats are miniscule and subject to ridicule
That sight from the bottom of the barrel must be a shitty view
Could give a fuck if your camp's paid
I was crafted of divine design to block your shiner glass shades
Oh, you hold gats, so your men must be illin', right
You about as ill as a shot of penicillin
Heard your forte, it's comin' soft like sorbet
I'mma destroy you and that fake emcee that you portray
Gimme a better reason I should pity ya
[?] four knuckles is my insignia
It's startlin', you fall for the tricks of marketin'
You roll with harlequins who speak the jargon of charlatans
My cosmic concepts be marvelin'
Soon it will all be over, fuck 'em with this exposure as a cardinal sin
I survive torture in a war [?]
The grand explorer, [?] of pandora
You wouldn't be fly in that [?] my kind
Supposed road blocks get rowed through like stop signs

[Hook]
I'm the walking rap-to-mic to whom you sacrafice
I am, the epiphany
The energy, entity [?] injuring enemies
I am, the epiphany
[?]
[?]
I am, the epiphany, the epiphany, the epiphany

[Verse 3 (Diabolic)]
Yo, for stress release, I go in my record's reach, west to east
Take a leak on your block, piss holy water, and bless the streets
Your best is weak, dissing me on the Internet, discreet
I'll find your name in the mainframe of existence and press delete
Diabolic, every metaphor I ever said is raw
Stay actin' foul, won't crack a smile unless it's yours
I bet it's fun to pop shit about [?], guns and Glock clips
Until I make your car go [?], and run your pockets
Broken profit, [?]'s bent
Heaven sent with [?] event
Dissect your best attempt to set the precedent
Disregard those at our shows by the car holds
'Cause my plan's complete when I brand the beast with a barcode
[?] into your [?], play charades
And sustain a rain of razor blades on your gay parade
These days, I think my life's strictly to smoke 550's
Top of the world, so if I fall, I'm takin' the sky with me

[Verse 4 (Manifest)]
I run against forces, impervious since design
I can move the path [?], fast forward and rewind
I don't speak English, I sound off in an alien language
Telepathically translated, you get it straight through [?]
You layman, I'm definin' the scientist
By spellin' my pseudonym in the planet's alignment ship
I'm [?] this, human born, you've been warned
By the rhyme I wrote for [?] while teachin' them cuneiform
My lyrics is on [?], my [?] is on your lyrics
Fear this, testament of experts
That hits hard in the head and makes the verse drop in your excrements
A man with a fowl mouth and an act that is down south
Pimpin' his style out in the wintertime
Diminishin' limits defined the minute I finish the rhyme
Exhibiting sickness inside, cats are scared as hell
I spit with gymness fit, and no bars are parallel
My service is removin' cervixes for [?]
Only sound you just make is pissin' in a lake from nervousness
I [?] swallow fuels, right through some hollow tunes
And burn you so black, your shadow won't even follow you

[Hook]
