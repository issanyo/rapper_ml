Diabolic ft. Celph Titled and Swave Sevah - “Higher”
[Emcee(s): Celph Titled, Diabolic, and Swave Sevah]
[Producer(s): Junior Makhno]

[Verse 1: Celph Titled]
There’s hidden messages in my lyrics—I’ll speak in bar codes
My CD barcode move weight by the carloads (Fucker)
You can't find my land mines with metal detectors, but my
Satellite'll see the shine on your bike pedal reflectors (Get ‘em)
Fire through your studio monitors and it's obvious
I'm down with Warhorse and part of Diabolic's war force (Salute)
I’ll show you how to do this, dunny.  I'm trying
To get that Bone Thugs-N-Harmony Ruthless money
Loaded guns out the armory to shoot these dummies
Hear a “uh,” hear a “yeah,” you might assume he's cumming/coming (Yes)
Burn your bitch 'til she's bald leather like taxiderms—she'll need
A double extension and, no, it won't be for tax returns (Uh)
You failed the first fucking question of a lie detector
Quiz and all they asked was what your gender is
The agenda is Celph Titled is sick with his
The most ignorant to spit and that's what my intention is

[Hook: Diabolic]
So roll it up, light it up.  This shit'll take you higher
Master kush, purple haze, this shit'll take you higher
Pure dope for the mind, this shit'll take you higher
Higher than you ever been, y’all, we got that fire
Turn it up, let 'em know this shit'll take you higher
Northern Lights Bubblegum, this shit'll take you higher
Pure, uncut raw, this shit'll take you higher
Higher than you ever been.  This that medicine

[Verse 2: Diabolic]
I got a villain's logic.  Rocking shows, I’ll fill the spot with
Crowds captivated—every two bars, I kill a hostage (Blao!)
I'm jobless, so I'm going into children's pockets
At the Grammy's, throwing brandy on Andy Milonakis (Haha)
I won't stop it until I got a million godless
Hoes there, chilling topless, screaming, “You’re the illest, 'Bolic!”
Critics can swallow a bottle of pills and vomit
Choke until your face is blue like war paint on William Wallace (Freedom!)
King of the jungle, hold gold in a silver goblet
Dropping knowledge that could have gorillas building rockets
Trying to fill my pockets 'til I feel accomplished
Fresh candy paint on my DeVille, and the grill is polished (Fresh)
Nah, I'm broke as ever.  I'm still as modest
Still knocking motherfuckers out, they’re still unconscious
In A Different World like Dwayne Wayne in Hillman College
While I'm chilling with L’s so fat, they're spilling chronic

[Hook: Diabolic]
So roll it up, light it up.  This shit'll take you higher
Master kush, purple haze, this shit'll take you higher
Pure dope for the mind, this shit'll take you higher
Higher than you ever been, y’all, we got that fire
Turn it up, let 'em know this shit'll take you higher
Northern Lights Bubblegum, this shit'll take you higher
Pure, uncut raw, this shit'll take you higher
Higher than you ever been.  This that medicine

[Verse 3: Swave Sevah]
Yo, don't you like when dudes rap about things they’re really known to be (I love it)
Flow tight, sit in the pocket, know how to control a beat
(About that) Any drama, they’ll welcome it openly
(Word up) But wait ‘til you fuckfaces get a load of me
(What?) I got the potency (Word), bars melt your brain
Make it leak out your ears and fuck up your upholstery (Ewww)
Ain't too many of you rap dudes could come close to me
(I’ll mean that) But to ease the blow, I’ll say it jokingly
(Haha, fuck that) But that's part of the main issue
Y'all stupid ass always think somebody playing with you (I ain’t playing)
I ain't here to amuse, I ain't your friend
Catch a swift right to your chin if you don't wipe off that grin (Blao!)
Nothing worse than hearing a grown man bitch
Send him home with his face bearing my whole handprint
Grown man shit.  Became a beast over time
Laid down the law of the land.  Now I'ma go get high

[Hook: Diabolic]
So roll it up, light it up.  This shit'll take you higher
Master kush, purple haze, this shit'll take you higher
Pure dope for the mind, this shit'll take you higher
Higher than you ever been, y’all, we got that fire
Turn it up, let 'em know this shit'll take you higher
Northern Lights Bubblegum, this shit'll take you higher
Pure, uncut raw, this shit'll take you higher
Higher than you ever been.  This that medicine

[Outro: Diabolic]
This shit'll take you higher.  This shit'll take you higher.  This shit'll take you higher.  Higher than you ever been.  This that medicine
