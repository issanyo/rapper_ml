Hook by Diabolic:
Yes yes y'all, check one two
Hands in the sky what the fuck you gon' do
I said yes yes y'all, check one two
To the beat yo what the fuck you gon' do
I said yes yes y'all, check one two
Hands in the sky what the fuck you gon' do
I said check check check check check check
Check to the beat y'all

When I say vibe to beat I mean timelessly
I open my eyes and speak whats inside of me
Inspires from defining me to exemplify the irony
I move lifelessly past the tyranny
They can't rhyme like me I put my soul on the page
You put ya foot in ya mouth I got the flow of a wave
Look at you now holdin ya face Show ya disgrace
What you be putting down donâ€™t sound dope on the stage
Im a iller emcee Ill kill a MC for not feelin me
My freestyle is better than your written lyrically
Fuck wit me your really see go on a killin spree
Through ya childish facility you look like kids to me
Compare this air I breathe to your whole trash steez
Recognize the real I represent the Last emcees
Youd have to be out ya fuckin mind to Battle me
Spit passion release the energy into the galaxy

Hook by Diabolic

When I say rhyme its like I mean redesign ya sight
Shine so bright you redefine the light
Im a sick emcee different breed ride the flight
Cliff dive at night when Im live on mic
I said any but not many stepped to me when I spoke
They laughin disrespecting without Getting the joke
I Dead emcees Comin for ya head and ya throat
You gon bow down to Whatever I wrote
Then your gonna quote like Can't belive he just said that
Roll a 4, 5, 6 to demolish ya head crack
I got the energy of a star you could never dead that
My squad will put up all they got where ya bread at
Put up ya crib bitch wait You ain't got one
Put up ya whip trick, nah You rode Shotgun
Put ya life on the line if you got a problem
Take out a blunt after we battle Im gon rob em

Hook by Diabolic

When I say represent until the death I meant
Still am emcee When every last penny Left is spent
IM ready for anything I ain't Never Hesitant
If Im there youll get a good show most definite
Still an underground hero could care less about cash
I do this for love make music caused the hours pass
The energy I put out comes back now at last
I just step on stage right after a pound of grass
They say we look like each other We could pass for brothers
I say Roll up another motherfucker did I stutter
So high Im on a different level above ya
I can't come down without a week off the butta
Who wanna try me remind me why I started freeing
Whoever it is I got the smarts and heart to beat him
If he somehow survive all the Scars and beatings
He get mac truck struck by all the stars he seein
