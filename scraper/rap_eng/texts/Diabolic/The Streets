[samples:  In the streets.  All of us fast, it's either hustles or my..my streets.  In the streets.  That's like fuckin' with what god is like, fuckin' with monsters.  In the streets.  I'm 'bout to smash.  Y'all ain't ready.  In the streets.  I'll be like traffic signs kid, all over the streets.  In the streets.  I'm 'bout to smash.  In the streets.  I'm 'bout to smash.]

[Verse 1:]

Yo, my co-star betrayed me, Bolic's far from crazy
But I let a pitbull loose in his yard with rabies
Two percent of me is raising, the bigger part is shady
So I'm gonna do it everyday 'till he starts to pay me (Pay me!)
Street deciple, the life I lead is trifle (uh-huh)
Read the Bible in my boxers and squeeze a rifle (blah)
Vicious cycle, goes around comes back around
And tracks you down like K-9 units with bats in hands (haha)
Ask around, when it rains it pours (yeah)
So the forecast for my life's hurricanes for sure (uh-huh)
To get mine I'm takin' yours, what's yours is mine
Insanity and genius, I cross the line all the time
On the grind, poppin' jaws out
'Till pigs run up in my crib like it's Bubba Sparks' house (haha)
So labels pray to Hey Zeus that this debut (what)
Don't give the kids something they can actually relate to
