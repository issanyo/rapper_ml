Inspector Ginko: The whole underworld worries me less than a single man...
Police Chief: Diabolik

[Verse 1: Diabolic]
Yo, brace yourself for impact. I'm raising Hell
With syntax like Satan cast an ancient spell on this track
An angel fell, who stays compelled to spit raps
And what the majors sell, he ain't afraid to tell you, “Shit's wack”
Now blaze an L and sit back, crack a six-pack
And sip that 'til it's pitch-black while you chit chat
This that dark side of a psychopath
Blacking out, so we don't see the light of the righteous path
He'll strike as fast as lightning when titans clash
Smash your mics in half, laughing like he siphoned nitrous gas
Type of wrath from Old Testament stories told
Anything you do to me is coming back forty-fold
Forty days and forty nights, did forty shows
With shorties so horny, they want my dick in a gloryhole
So y'all should know I will murder these tracks
'Til I'm on my last leg like an amputee's kneecap
It seems that every time I hear emcees rap
The voices in my head scream at me, saying, “He's wack!"
These cats act like bitches, their vagina sore
Like dinosaurs crawled out their cervix and their hymen tore
I'm designed for war on the Long Island shores
Swinging a rapper’s severed head by his spinal cord
In a blind rage, on a drunken tirade
As a diversion while me and Preem mastermind the crime wave

[Verse 2: Diabolic]
Every verse I brainstorm makes hurricanes form
Wind gusts that flip trucks, raining burning napalm
Too many rappers here get on my nerves—to stay calm
Put on the radio and heard the same songs all day long
It's mind-numbing like doctors squeezing forceps
To load my brain with Novocain in my cerebral cortex
Seasoned war vet piss on these peoples’ door steps
Like, "Suck my dick soaked in three weeks of ball sweat"
My cult following shares the same perspective
They'd die for their beliefs like Dave Koresh's in Waco, Texas
Deranged and reckless, what I say is infectious
Plus Preem is scratching 'til needles snap and break the records
The label pressed it, giving y'all the extreme
A sick fuck like sex scenes from Ed Gein's wet dreams
I'm getting open a soul with less emotion
Cold as the cryogenic potion Walt Disney's head is froze in
Set in motion and momentum's building up
I can feel the rush like a vanilla Dutch filled with dust
This high class dime's attached to my shaft
And I'm fast to get in their guts like gastric bypass
Why ask why? I don't bat an eyelash
And if you're after my cash, then kiss the crack of my ass
While I drop manure and take a shot of Dewar's
With those underground villains like Bane in Gotham sewers
