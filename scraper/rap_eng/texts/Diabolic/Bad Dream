[Verse 1: Diabolic]
One day my baby mama took my daughter to Orlando
It's been seven years now, that's more than I can handle
The judge let her go, I want to make 'em all examples
Putting on my camo and licking off the ammo
But I can't though, so it's support I gotta pay
Now I see her in the summer and alternating holidays
Plus I got a son with this other cunt, I have to find her
One day it's all good and then off to North Carolina
She said, "I'm moving to my sister's doing what I like
I met a guy he's really nice, go to hell get a life
Kingston's doing great no he doesn't miss his dad"
Bitch shut the fuck up I gave you everything you have
So I filed all the paperwork to go to family court
Why the fuck did I ever take this bitch's panties off?
At least I got my son I'm assuming this is fate
But I don't know how much more of this bullshit I can take

[Hook]
It's like everyday I wake up to a bad dream
I don't got shit to live for no more
It's like everyday I wake up to a bad dream
I don't got shit to live for no more
It's like everyday I wake up to a bad dream
I don't got shit to live for no more
It's like everyday I look up at the sky to see the same black cloud that's been following me

[Verse 2]
Search for Diabolic see my name on top of Google
Still I'm broke as fuck stuck eating Ramen Noodles
I'm great at what I do my debut was a classic
But every kid who has it when and downloaded that shit
So, back to square one damn I need this paper
I was like fuck it I'll test my luck up at a major
Handing out some demos calling in some favors
Took a couple meetings they said "I'll call ya later"
I walked into the office they were way across the room
Said "your shits too hard you should try some autotune"
I'm like who you talking to? They got a little startled
Then replied "no offense you reminded me of Marshall"
Oh here we go again, apparently to them
Being white and lyrical means comparing me to Em
It just goes to show the severity of trends
And chances are Diabolic will never see the end

[Hook]
It's like everyday I wake up to a bad dream
I don't got shit to live for no more
It's like everyday I wake up to a bad dream
I don't got shit to live for no more
It's like everyday I wake up to a bad dream
I don't got shit to live for no more
It's like everyday I look up at the sky to see the same black cloud that's been following me

[Verse 3]
Since me and wifey split and she moved in with her sister
Things have gotten crazy she's acting like I'm with her
She broke into my Facebook hacked into my twitter
Called the police and told the pigs that I hit her
Now dees are taking me into custody tonight
And my wrists are turning purple cause they cuffing me so tight
Fucking with me like Bolic's an abusive husband
All because I kept my composure doing nothing
Now she's trying to bait me into a new discussion
Screaming "I demand to know who the fuck you were fucking"
Jesus H. Christ bitch hit the brake lights
You officially lost your damn mind you ain't right
Have a safe flight take your ass and that slutty jaw
To the funny farm and lock yourself in somebody's barn
That's where you belong as for me I've had enough
I've packed my stuff I'm moving on this is wack as fuck
Peace

[Hook]
It's like everyday I wake up to a bad dream
I don't got shit to live for no more
It's like everyday I wake up to a bad dream
I don't got shit to live for no more
It's like everyday I wake up to a bad dream
I don't got shit to live for no more
It's like everyday I look up at the sky to see the same black cloud that's been following me

[Outro]
Oh yeah, great, great what is this record deal come with another baby mama to drain my fucking pockets?
Oh yeah that's great, I'll sign right there

Oh that sounds wonderful. Ok, I must be out of my fucking mind. Fucking with these hoes
