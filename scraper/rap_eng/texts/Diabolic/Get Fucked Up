Uh, waddup, Diabolic, been drinkin' all day.  Takin' over the game (word) Oz Terentino, yeah.  Triple Op
Bitches to the front (where you at)
Soldiers to the back (yeah)
C'mon, walk with me
C'mon, c'mon
Yo

[Verse 1:]'

Yo if you like me, then you'll probably like me
And you might be out right now drinkin' a Long Island ice-tea
If you got wifey, you remembered not to bring her
And you gonna ride home drunk, and give cops the finger
Find some dro to twist the dutch and open it
Roll the shit and you make sure I'm the one you smokin' with
In a stolen six, hydroplanin'
On the clear view, in the rearview 5-O's gaining
But it's alright, that's life, you only live once
Smoke those six blunts and drive your ?? drunk
This for live cats, in the club with nine strapped
Playin' my track, drunk while they drive back
From the streets out to Puff's Hampton Beach house
Takin' a whole bottle to they head like Steve Stout
This for cats grinding for weekly cash
Catching a DWI smashed, while CD blasts

1st Chorus:

Get fucked up, right now
Drive home drunk, c'mon
Get fucked up, all my soldiers
Drive home drunk, all my bitches
Everybody live your life
Get fucked up tonight
Everybody get it right
Fuck every bitch in sight

[Verse 2:]

Yo the fit survive, and you ain't fit without six or five
So live your lives with 22's equipped to drive
And (get fucked up), it's that simple
Ask every fan if the jams they packin' to
Go find a bouncer who's twice your weight class
And leave his face smashed with your champagne glass
Then skate fast, drive, get away, crash
And scream "Fuck the cops!" while they pass
I don't care if you take cash to blaze hash
Walk a straight path or pump rock like Dane Dash <--(?)
Keep it poppin' like me with people watchin'
To see when Diabolic's debut LP is droppin'
You can see in my eyes that I'm teachin' you why
I don't have to pull out to make you reach for the sky
So throw your hands up, scream and get live
If you already with me, don't even reply, just

2nd Chorus:

Get fucked up, right now
Drive home drunk, c'mon
Get fucked up, all my soldiers
Drive home drunk, all my bitches
Everybody live your life
Get fucked up tonight
Everybody get it right
I'll rob all your ice <--(?)

[Verse 3:]

Yo at the club hoes see me, like what's he thinkin'
To go outside, puke and keep drinkin'
I'm thinkin' I'm the same bum who ate crumbs
Then found time to find a chick to get brains from
When the bass pump, proud shout and wild out
East coast, west coast, mid-west, down south
I'm no different, so get live and let's ride
I wanna see you at the sex drive up at ex. five
Mommy let's slide to my crib and get high
You always got a place to crash like left eye
Shake your ass and breast size, let's rock tonight
Got bottles popped on ice, so what's not to like
You're dressed to kill, radiating sex appeal
Sip this proof, let loose, then stress your feel
Bring it on, strip to g-strings and thongs
You don't think it's wrong, c'mon just sing the song

3rd Chorus:

Get fucked up, right now
Drive home drunk, c'mon
Get fucked up, all my soldiers
Drive home drunk, all my bitches
Everybody live your life
Get fucked up tonight
Everybody get it right
Get fucked up tonight

Outro:

Triple Optix, drive drunk tonight
Oz T, drive drunk tonight
Immortal Technique, drive drunk tonight
Stronghold, drive drunk tonight
Travis McFet, drive drunk tonight
My boy Dexstar, drive drunk tonight
Lou Cipher, drive drunk tonight
Everybody, drive drunk tonight

Fuck it, we out.  One
