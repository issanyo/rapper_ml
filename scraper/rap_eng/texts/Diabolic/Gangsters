Haha, Diabolic, Foul Play

New York got those mothafucking (Gangstas)
Yeah they do, Catch 22, Stronghold
Here we go

London got those mothafucking (Gangstas)
Around my way, Foul Play put ‘em in a shallow grave
‘Cause (Gangstas) flip pounds of haze
But y’all mothafuckas now a days ain’t (Gangstas)
You claim to be, give the people what they came to see
Real (Gangstas) just aim and squeeze
Slap you in the face and take your weed
But (Gangstas) ain’t faking jacks
Talkin’ ’bout sellin’ yay and crack
You (Gangstas) when you making tracks
I don’t believe what you say in raps
We (Gangstas) who kept it real
Still independent with a record deal
Them (Gangstas) we dress to kill
Fatigues all ready like it’s Desert Shield
Them (Gangstas) east and coast
Fuck the president we revolt
Some (Gangstas) would squeeze your throat
Laugh in your face as you bleed and choke
Those (Gangstas) scar your life
Stick it in your wife with the hardest pipe
We (Gangstas) at the bar tonight
Getting drunk enough to start a fight
Like (Gangstas) but we thinking right
Fund my shit, I’ma sling some white
With (Gangstas) we think alike
That’s why this bitch who’s singing likes them
(Gangstas) who control the game
Pitbulls let off they choking chain
Real (Gangstas) who flow insane
Foul Play mothafucka know the name

We (Gangstas)
Long Island got those mothafucking (Gangstas)
Peckham got those mothafucking (Gangstas)
Brooklyn got those mothafucking (Gangstas)
Brixton got those mothafucking (Gangstas)
Harlem got those mothafucking (Gangstas)
Holston got those mothafucking (Gangstas)
Queens they got those mothafucking (Gangstas)
Hackney got those mothafucking (Gangstas)

[(Gangstas) repeats until the end]
