I never thought the shit I say would affect the public
Enough that some Masons would have me abducted
But it seems ‘Bolic must have talked enough shit
So they approached me in my house out in Suffolk
Was late afternoon towards the end of the summer
On my block I seen four men in a Hummer
So I made a break for it, beginning to wonder
They chased me, hit a lady, dented the bumper
I hid under this box truck a block up
Unarmed and wishing that I had a Glock tucked
Started crawling out from under and got stuck
That’s when three cats dressed in all black popped up
Grabbed some broken glass fast and hopped up
The first cat who approached me got cut
Tried to run got snuffed while people watched us
And thrown in their whip with the doors locked shut
Blindfolded, wrists wrapped in duct tape
So I started wilding out acting like a nut case
They pistol whipped me like, “Shut your mouth, fuckface”
Won’t hesitate to empty this clip, just wait
Thought it was Jake cause I pushed enough weight
Or someone that I stuck cause you know I love tapes
Then I recall that one night I was up late
And Technique called saying, “Meet me upstate.”
He explained to me the revolution rises near
It’s gotta be the same reason why I’m here
I just stayed calm thinking like I’m James Bond
The only thing that I could do was stay strong
Drove about an hour, didn’t take long
If you thought I was scared to death you ain’t wrong
Had to wait for them to get where they was going
Till I felt the car stop, heard the back door open
They marched me in some building bloody and broken
Stuck me in a room, I heard a voice soft-spoken
Like, “We looking for Technique, do you know him?”
Seems pretty clear how the two of you are rolling
The only thing I said was fuck you for the moment
So then he burned my chest with the bone he was smoking
Next thing I knew Poison Pen must’ve broke in
I heard his voice like then heard an explosion
Grabbed one cat, quickly slit his throat
Then cut me loose and handed me the gat he was holding
I opened fire while dude reached for his holster
Hit the floor ready for war, I’m a soldier
He pulled out, shot, I took one in the shoulder
He took two in the sternum, his life was over
Pen picked up his gun, we ran for the door
Licking shots at every single man that we saw
Just when we thought we couldn’t handle no more
Qwest and Tech came through, blamming the four
Was on the sixth floor, the elevator ain’t safe
So we hit the stairwell trying to make an escape
Made it to the second floor staying in place
Ten more enemies came raising the stakes
We fled to the hallway and left the chair stuck
To jam the door but caught a case of bad luck
Tech and Qwest went in the vents but we’re fucked
Cause me and Pen are too fat to fit in the air ducts
Got two choices, surrender or stay and fight
So the first cat that came in, I sprayed him twice
The next dude’s scope had a laser sight
Aimed at my head so Pen tackled me and saved my life
Grazed his right, held his Glock in his left
The dude that shot at me took a shot in the chest
Three more came through, two rocking a vest
So I loaded up the cop-killers popping the rest
Ran out of bullets now and couldn’t reload
So we locked ourselves in a room like keep low
Paranoid and confused like where do we go
When I notice someone’s eye looking through the peephole
I creep slow and as I got to the door
Heard shots fire, it was Tech popping the four
Qwestion came through, dropped to the floor
Took out two cats but watch it there’s more
Forgot what I saw, took a deep breath
Came out the room slowly and seen Tech
Each step remembering that there’s three left
Then they popped out screaming, “We ain’t leave yet.”
We kept it moving thinking we’re done for
No ammo but only had to make it one floor
Made it one floor then guess what son saw
All of Stronghold standing at the front door
We escaped but that don’t explain this mishap
That don’t explain why Diabolic got kidnapped
It don’t explain why this gat click-clacked
Or why they interrogated me on this track
The sick fact is that we’re sheep for the slaughter
In the new world with George Bush keeping the order
We found evidence about increasing our borders
While the media’s cornered to mislead the supporters
The evil is taught us to use an excuse
We’ve all been lied to so it’s time for the truth
