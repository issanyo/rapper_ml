[Verse 1:]

Yo at birth I obtained the power to brainstorm flood rain
And bloodstain a state trooper then break thru the handcuff chains
Only to offend folks with every pen stroke
It's spoken word in a trenchcoat flashing the event host
Don't step close, anyone I'm brawlin' with will call it quits
When I ball a fist and punch thru a wall of bricks
Like flawlessness, I'll chain smoke your brave hopes
Rob your stage coach, with a blade close to your dame's throat
See it's human nature to use this razor
Performing euthanasia 'till God himself can't rejuvinate ya
And Suffolk's poor public, demands more of it
When I stick a warm musket thru a supreme court justice
Makin' heroin phenes out of the American dream
Arm wrestling fears while terrors peer like Marilyn's team
So when my debut reach platinum in two weeks
I get two beats to the crew chief, during an MTV news brief
