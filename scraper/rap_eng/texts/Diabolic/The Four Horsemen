[Verse 1: DSEIZE]

I'm the vicious fire from the zippolighter, words can't get extinguished
My rhymes is flamboyant like a grip of Psilocybin
Eyes is red like the highest zombie from the living dead
When I'm walking on the streets I'm falling in the fence
I'm wrecked and broke, hustling for living, no job
I'm feeling tense after ten grams of coke, shivering
Driving on the sidewalk, my mind is above the clouds
Knocking on the heaven's gate but God told me to keep out
Evil thoughts inside my brain, I'm carving after answers
Inside my veins, no trace, I'm monstrous when I rage
The Four Horsemen is so loud it's hard to ignore
But with four pencils we eat beats and transform
Our papers to high quality stencil, I'm Satan's disciple
Breaking your idols like I'm spraying a rifle
Raising my vitals, insane when I'm laying the vocals
Taking the haters' souls and we are slaying it global

[Hook x2: STaTiiX & MC Infliction]

Step up in the chamber, bringing mad flavor
Finger bone pens leaking blood up on the paper
Four horsemen with an appetite for danger
Hell be the comfort zone, no we're not strangers

[Verse 2: MC Infliction]

Landed on this planet, bandit, plan is: cause damage
Hysterically laughing, watching your family frantically panic
Spazmatic bad habits, rabid bash bastards
Swaggots like Frogger, I just crash um into traffic
I'm that sick on dat piff, devilish wordsmith
I'm scribblin' sermons that the peasants'll worship
Four Horsemen, reign of terror down-pourin'
You'll feel it in every orifice, style is an orphan
But I'm born to be king, 13th blood courses
Soar to orbit with the forces of a million horses
Shape-morphin' monster, clobber silly Porsches
You emcees will never leave off of your mama's porches
Bring war like storage, rhymes paint portraits
You can't ignore us, the young Chuck Norris
It's been a dark year for hip-hop but now we got torches
Prophecy fulfilled, you ain't fuckin' with the Horsemen!

[Hook x2]

[Verse 3: STaTiiX]

I'm a fire-spittin' dragon with the rhyme and rhythm patterns
I will climb inside your mind and occupy that hidden labyrinth
The pin-pullin' pessimist perfectin' this penmanship
Heaven sent me to present this generation with an exodus
Questin' for the vested knowledge like a Methodist
I'm coming through your screen, mother-eff an exorcist
I'm possessing this microphone, fight to free the people
Up under the Fed's skin like a hypodermic needle
The Four Horsemen, we serve a higher function
Riding blunted with a mic tryna cause some wide destruction
I'm not reluctant, my mind is fucked, plus
There's live mines wired to my nuts, you won't survive what I am bustin'
You bouta find the fury and the spite, on the mic
It's like we're born-again centurions, except I'd rather serve
A spliff of green than the Byzantines, you ain't fuckin' with
The killa team, wack emcees please step to the guillotine

[Hook x2]

[Verse 4: Diabolic]

It appears God didn't engineer us the same
I do the right thing with the left hemisphere of my brain
It's hell on Earth, heaven's fearing the flames
Got us burning weed and chugging Everclear for the pain, see
I been raising hell since Satan fell from heaven
Locking shit down like Rick Ross doing cell inspections
Been a nutcase since I first felt aggression
Telling reverends lies while I blaze L's confessin'
Not to mention I do what others won't endorse
But when the hope was lost I returned to hold the fort
As a show of force I swing harder than George Foreman
We're Four Horsemen to back me up versus your squadron
Marchin' towards all y'all apartment doors
To paint a bloody masterpiece in this art of war
So what's beef? beef is me turning the tide
Spittin' fire, watching y'all burning alive

[Hook x2]
