Yo once upon a time, not long ago
I was driving around with a hundred pounds of dro (word)
Next thing I know, 5-O's behind me
I look at my dash I'm doing close to 90
Problems like this ain't supposed to find me (na)
So I thought about it, pulled over finally
Like, he might search the trunk, don't remind me
Luckily he flashed the lights and drove it by me
So I proceed to turn right at the first light (yeah)
Now I'm heading east on Jericho Turnpike (yeah)
Been doing this for years man, I had to earn stripes
Transported 40 P's on my worst night
Word like, Bolic been making paper lately
And that's just making sure all these haters hate me
But enough small talk, let's get back to the story
I met this kid Jay, with a package of 40
He said 'I know my numbers 29 now, but I want 28'
I said let me find out
Bolic knows he did good business with you
But that don't mean I won't swing this fist and hit you
He agrees so I'm off to my next stop
20 in a dufflebag about to get dropped (yeah)
Left that spot and got 39 left
Cops behind me again, shit, I'm holding my breath
Pigs behind me, 39 in the trunk
Well at least I ain't got 30 9's in the trunk
Vacuum sealed just some kong and some skunk
I should be fine cause Po-9 is some punks
I can't front, I can move an ounce of rock
I just feel safer with a hundred pounds of pot (yeah)
The only set back I drive around a lot
But I ain't down to stop 'til every town is locked (right)
Enough about being still in suffer county
Half-wits expecting knees to put the cuffs around me
Got lucky again, Jake made the next left
Next step, meet this cat I ain't met yet
Had to head west, now I'm passing his house
So I parked, dropped off the dufflebag, and I'm out (peace)
Northern Long Island, heading back to the south
Like damn, what the fuck's this traffic about
Time to proceed with 19 P's left
This faggot named Mike who's I gotta meet next
His money's on point but he got a weak rep
Another punk who ain't happy with the number he gets
Got to his crip with the last 19
Said I'll be back tomorrow to collect my cream
Next thing I know cops have me stopped quick
Like, can I search the trunk
Yeah, I ain't got shit
Hit me

Haha, Yo, If you having money problems, I feel bad for you son
Got 99 pounds, who the fuck needs 1
Hit me
Got 99 pounds, who the fuck needs 1
If you having money problems, I feel bad for you son
Got 99 pounds, who the fuck needs 1
Hit me
