[Intro - Cralls & Diabolic:]

Y'all already know, Cralls on the beat
It's time to wake the fuck up now
It's about that time
Diabolic (yeah)
Cralls where the fuck you at
I'm right here
We 'bout to go in right now
Alright let's do it then

[Verse 1:Diabolic]

I'm far too extreme, for marketing schemes, talkin' to teens
Still on stage barkin', and they're startin' to scream
As far as it seems, hip-hop's a foreign regime
We the squad of marines armed with particle beams
I'm a starvin' artist full of horrible dreams
With an arsonal or bars to pull it apart at the seams
Workin' hard for the cream, I'm earnin' my keep
Top of the world chillin' with the earth at my feet
Word on the street Bolic's 'bout to vertical leap
Fly head first into a cipher and murder the beat
I'll get personal, persecute a person's beliefs
Screamin' God don't exist while you in a church with a priest
Burnin' a leaf to cure my sickening thoughts
Twisted off quarts of Guiness 'till my vision distorts
So before you test, I suggest you mission abort
Or you're fuckin' dead, like you stuck your dick in a corpse

[Chorus:Diabolic]

Allow me to explain, this is not a game
Turn on the radio, shit is all the same
Another wack song gettin' stuck inside my brain
So it's fuck the world, shit will never change
[2X]

[Verse 2:Cralls]

I'm not a rat, but I dwell in catacombs why I'm always dark
I spit poison in your arteries to close your heart
My flow is hard, I'm an animal on Noah's Ark
I'm equivalent to Da Vinci, both composing art
I'm exposing harm, and only I can judge myself
I'm the devil now, so Satan is stuck in hell
I take whatever's dealt, use it as a brutal force
Make any two divorce and blame it on the stupid whore
Givin' birth underground would make your rap emerging <--(?)
Cralls and Diabolic for sure is not your average person
I never had a purpose, I was born an accident
See I'm a dog, fuckin' raw like my rappin' is
What my habit is, I combine words to kill
I was born with it, I never had to learn the skill
I'm fuckin' sick, my doc made me turn to pills
When you address me by name, I'm reffered as Ill

[Verse 3:Cralls & Diabolic]

[Cralls]

Fuck this battle, I'm a war vet
I'm original, and American-made like Corvette
I ain't got a fortune but enough to carry me
You could learn something from us, we're the fuckin' faculty
Got the world mad at me, you wouldn't want to battle me
Unless you want to get ripped open like anatomy
Laugh at me, you're lucky if you get your jaw to open
I know you're a pussy cause your water's broken

[Diabolic]

Yo, Diabolic don't need to pull a pistol and squeeze
To knock you off your high horse like Christopher Reeves
Me and Cralls will brawl 'till we're crippled and bleed
Just to say some real shit the kids will believe
So it's simple to see, if we're in the same place
I would slap that fake tear drop off Lil' Wayne's face
And fuck Dre, put him in a live rap battle
I'd kill him on stage like he's Dimebag Darrell
