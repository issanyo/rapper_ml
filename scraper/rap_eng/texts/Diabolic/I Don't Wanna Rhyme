[Intro]
Yo, Engineer!
I think I lost my mothafuckin' mind, man
Diabolic, Foul Play
We takin' over the mothafuckin' game

[Verse 1]
I remember being on my momma’s porch
A kid with rotten thoughts, tossin' tomahawks
At kids to knock ’em off their rockin' horse
Now I’m at war, connectin' cops
To electric shock treatment, and I’m not leavin'
'Til their eyes pop bleedin' and hearts stop beatin'
The whole cop precinct thinks I should be in a padded room
When they the bastards who
Fucked Luima in the ass with brooms
I travel through and kill the mothers of these savage goons
Fill the house with gaseous fumes
Lightin' up a match like, "BOOM!"
On the crime scene they’ll have the camera zoomed
At every massive wound
I left when I stabbed the womb with plastic spoons
And now the planet’s doomed, ‘cause this afternoon
I was pissin' out the Sun’s flames
With guns aimed at the Moon
Cats assume I’m crackin' jokes, but I ain’t laughin’, folks
I’d slash your throat for a pack of smokes if my ass is broke
Stashin' coke, stayin' cool, I ain’t no nervous wreck
I earn respect, burnin' purple sess durin' urine tests
I flirt with certain death
Attackin' for some fame and fortune
With some ragin' swordsmen
Torchin' who's on stage performin'
Take this chloroform and pour it on some fresh linen
Gag, you have your head spinnin', tied up like the tenth innin'
Bread-winnin’, I sex women, slap the chaperone
Take her in the back to bone
And tape it on my camera-phone
I have the throne hard as granite stone
The illest rapper known inside New York’s catacombs
Underground, ‘cause that's my home

[Hook]
I think I lost my mind, I’m 'bout to cross the line
Start a riot, kill a cop, and just toss the 9
I’m hungry all the time, pain is all I find
Fuck my music! I’ma loose it, I don’t wanna rhyme

[Verse 2]
I was born from mom’s colon
Possessed by the ghost of Lamont Coleman
Now Sean’s flowin' like hemoglobin
Through a hole in Ron Goldman
I’ll be slappin' jaws, bitches I be stabbin' raw
Tappin' more than a Jehovah’s witness knockin' at your door
Smashin' whores, bangin' in the car like 808’s
More semen than a naval base
Skeetin' on their facial traits
Me and my label mates
Don’t need a watch from Jacob’s place
To make her take a taste
And add devil's horns to an angel face
Ain’t at the VMA’s, I’ll be up at CMJ
With bitches on their knees to pray, swallowin' my DNA
Drunk chuggin' ENJ, dodgin' pigs drivin' Fords
I see more holdin' cells than salesmen at Verizon stores
Iron core, hard as nails, raised inside a garbage pail
Could've went to Harvard, Yale
Or Princeton, but chose to market sales
The end is near, I sense your fear
‘Cause me and Engineer guzzled Everclear
And sabotaged the Western Hemisphere
They sent us here when I stepped in Hell with Jezebels
Pressed the 12 and Heaven fell every time my record sells
I'll be dead or left in jail before I'll be the next to fail
Other cats don’t measure well
Like ounces on a metric scale
My train of thoughts pay the cost and never take a loss
Make you a decayin' corpse
And laugh through my day in court
Don’t play it off like I won’t run a razor straight across
Your throat 'til there’s tomato sauce
Sprayin' towards your neighbor's porch

[Hook]
I think I lost my mind, I’m 'bout to cross the line
Start a riot, kill a cop, and just toss the 9
I’m hungry all the time, pain is all I find
Fuck my music! I’ma loose it, I don’t wanna rhyme
