What do you do when the devil looks right in your eyes?
And you find out your entire life is a lie?
Inside Capitol Hill, those cowards were laughing
The towers were crashing; they allowed it to happen
Devoured the fragments from the media site
With some of the sickest shit I've ever seen in my life
Orchestrated by masons all related
Their royal sailing oil fields corporate hatred
But how can I be concerned with world war?
Gotta worry about dying from sticking some girl raw
What you heard before ain't as big of a lesson
As George and Jeb Bush rigging elections
Press release worldwide, west to east
Followed by George Junior's acceptance speech
I'm too stressed to sleep, but believe I'm alive
And death just creeps, so I sleep when I die
I'm Screaming out "Why?" as I reach for the sky
I dance with the devil, God don't even reply
Burn weed 'til I'm high with my chest wheezing
Left breathing, shadow of death creeping
My ex beefing, laying threats to get even
Me dreaming of Russian Roulette left leaking
But if I was left leaking, I'd be accepting judgment
So I made my choice: I ain't accepting nothing

[Hook]
I don't believe your truth; I've been lied to!
So if you're ready to fight, I'm right beside you!
If you don't believe, you don't see what I do
Just open your eyes, the truth's inside you

[Verse 2]
I run in CBS with a Beretta shootin'
This way, I can televise the revolution
No resolution when cops load up a Glock clip
And shoot like you Diallo holding his wallet
Thankfully 'Bolic was raised with street smarts
Taught since birth to evade police narcs
Prayin' to God, fighting Satan's beast mark
Hoping one day I can make the seas part
I cross the train-tracks and hear an outcry
Like why's the ghetto always on the south side?
Skeptics will understand the art of war
When they lock the streets and declare martial law
When a rain of microchips start to pour
What the fuck you think the National Guard is for?
It's a bad dream, when Big Brother maps genes
And injects technology in kids' vaccines
It's next to nothing when my blood pressure's rushing
And damn right I fight sleep, cause death's his cousin
Now maybe you'll believe me and listen a bit
When you're on line to put a microchip in your wrist
We're living this shit, government's playing a role
They invented AIDS for population control
They've taken a hold and sold Satan your soul
While people like me and you are breaking the mold

[Hook x2]

[Verse 3]
It's not just my home, it's real in every place
Like Anthrax sent from a military base
Y'all emulate snakes that imitate disciples
Watching the Catholic Church manipulate the Bible
I never stood a chance of enjoying the scripture
Freemasons freebase and poison the mixture
My point is true
But the boys in blue got me looking over my shoulder trying to enjoy the view
Got two words for Bloomberg and Giuliani
Fuck you, George Bush, and the Illuminati
I wanna' go in the oval office
Pop a few
And act out the cover of Revolutionary Volume 2
They're watching you, it's the national pastime
Believe me I'll be red-flagged for that last line
Po-9'll lock down the hood forever
They a bigger gang than Bloods and Crips put together
Marines still die in Iraq, it seems ill
Bush already contracted lobbyists to rebuild
Don't fund his campaign he the foulest vermin
Trying to put a pipeline owned by Halliburton
But god's watching us to keep the evidence clear
While Lucifer whispers orders in the president's ear
Heaven is near but Hell is even closer
I watch it everyday watching demons approach us

[Hook]
