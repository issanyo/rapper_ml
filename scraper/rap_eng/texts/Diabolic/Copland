[Intro - Poison Pen:]

Uh-huh, yeah, I represent Da Circle
This go out to Fuzz, the Jake, po-po
One time, them boys
Haha, better known to y'all as the beast
Yeah, uh-huh, check it

[Verse 1 - Poison Pen:]

40 to a pig's head <--(?), get in the crib
Hit the lamp post, and took a 40 yard piss
So sit twice, that's good
Can't keep my cock out, turn the boogie
This rookie flat foot, had his Glock out
Damn it's so wild, you wildin'
You all gung-ho, for that bum ass 25,000
Should of got a job at Staples, stockin' shelves
4 to 12, get you the safe paper
Here's the idea, I'm Poison Pen, yeah stay right there man
I live with no string, breath easy
You get loud, I get loud back
You calm down, you get wild, I get wild back
No disrespect to the kid, I get ?? as fuck
Especially when my record is clean
Patted me down, deputes stacks
Half for me, got her realize only got two g's back, damn

[Verse 2 - Diabolic:]

I hate muthafuckin’ cops like Justin Vowby and Richard Murphy
So I paid a prostitute to fuck ‘em slowly and give ‘em herpes
Protect and serve me 'cause I pay taxes right
Instead they go 730, and beat me with their magna lights
It happened twice, Huntricle Station in Central Iceland
Gettin’ righteous, whoopin’ my ass with the Sheriff’s night-stick
I’d rather fight than run, like Will Tarance, guest starrin’ in the precinct
Smackin’ the death sergeant with my arrest warrants
Treated like my eyes are blind, so I do right in silent ?? time
For slittin’ cop’s throat with a badge he hides behind
It’s a sign of the times and made me a firm believer
They'll perform illegal search and seize ya take your work and beat ya
I rolled up on a cop with a stolen go-kart and hit him so hard
He rico-shades and flips over his own patrol car
Call for back-up, I won’t run when I hear the iron blast
I’ll just laugh when I see them muthafuckin’ sirens flash


[Verse 3 - Goodtime Slim:]

Ayo secretly assaulted, decieving ghetto orphans
Momma ran the righteous equivalent to abortions
Remain silent, the law which you pretend to be
Public defenders, with no interest in defendin' me
Whatever happened with to each is own
Your timeline of corruption stretchin’ reach their own
This ain’t Julius Ceaser, seize and assist pa
These don’t exist if police cuff my wrist pa
I got patience, got a strong resolve
But if all else fail, got the chrome revolved
In revolvalution, upholds my constitutional rights
If you think they playin’ fair you delusional
I cause contusions to coppers, who confuse a few
Make they black bruise ooze white puss like a Suzy-Cue
I’m like the big bad wolf to these piglets, with no resentment
A co-defendant of the ??


[Verse 4 - Fatz Da Assassin:]

Four cops, 41 shots, 19 hit the frame, close range
One unarmed man, like ?? poll
My scriptures beat the Gospel
Protect and serve, mathematically impossible
Continuous oppressive procession, latin and nigga depression
Is now your condition
Resist arrest, they got ya number, get your teeth knocked out
Four astericks on a plunger
Coward bastards got me pulled over in traffic
Talkin’ sarcastic, smithies’ on they ratchets
I speak for the niggas and spics, dudes and chicks
Without the badge and gun, you ain’t shit
Crime scene alterations, cover-up altercations
That end in homicide with no justification
Political agendas achieved though economic
P.O.L.I.C.E spell pigs in ebonics


[Verse 5 - Immortal Technique:]

We were swallowed by the system for 500 summers
In order to satisfy Europe and Americas hunger
The preach-hate police state gives football numbers
But it’s always probation, for the rich, white
New generation of pill-poppin’ politicians that make a donation
The segregation of drug offenses prevent their incarceration
You can’t justify your liberation, 'cause you’re the incarnation of Jefferson Davies' nation
The Justice System is a plantation, the Blue-Klux-Klan overseers beat us lifeless
I wish someone would rape a cop with a night-stick
Side swipe you in Central Park and get your bike flipped
You pretend to be righteous and use torture devices
In Chicago, New York and down in the south of course
Use to hunt us for sport, now we takin’ the court
With some trumped-up charges added in the report
‘Cause you hopin’ that we cop a plea
You can keep your fake rehabilitation philosophy
Fuck prison, my freedom is prophecy
So I’m drivin’ with the pump-shot cocked in Copland
With heavy-metal screamin’ out like a Rock band
‘Cause if you don’t respect me, then I don’t respect you
And if you don’t protect us, then it will affect you
Each bullet is a scalpel and it will dissect you

You muthafuckas know what it is
Immortal Technique, Da Circle
Harlem, Brooklyn
Back again muthafucka
We ain't takin' no shit from no pig mothafucka
You heard that nigga
Immortal Technique
'Fuck out of here
