[Verse 1 - Diabolic]
I got pope John Paul in his casket turning
When I'm at a Catholic sermon smashed with a flask of bourbon
Dashing in a black suburban, passing, swervin'
Crashin', burnin' like attacks from Iraq insurgents
But now I'm back, determined to have some virgin
Taking face shots like botox from a plastic surgeon
Not your average person, cause this cash I'm earning
Got me riding dirty like the mastered version of my tracks with cursing
The illest cat for certain, too perverted to mention
In a class by myself like internal suspension
I'm terminal, spreading through your chest and ribs
'til the song's stuck in your head and gives you less than a month left to live
Infect the kids, I love to poison minds
Got hoes bending over backwards like double-jointed spines
I'm at the point in time where I don't give a flying fuck
And if I get fired up you get your jaw wired shut
And it's

[Hook - Diabolic]
Mic check, one two, we back on the block again
Body in the trunk, somebody's getting shot again
Fist full of haze, stomach full of Heineken
My bitch put the radio on - No, not again!
We want that real shit, something I can feel shit
You know the gutter shit, fuck all that other shit
That go to war shit, kicking in the door shit
Diabolic, Vinnie Paz, yeah, that raw shit

[Verse 2 - Vinnie Paz]
Ayo D, you the foulest motherfucker around
Anyone who got a beef with us get stuck with the pound
That's regardless if they haters or they fuck with the sound
And regardless if they ravers or they come from uptown
I don't care who gets stuck - Black, white, Spanish, anybody
My weaponry a left hook and a mini shottie
I don't discriminate, Pazienza blazing people
I'll kill your dog and eat him up like I was Asian people
Me and Diabolic similar to haze and diesel
It's straight to the head and stick inside the veins of people
And Pazienza too intelligent, my brain'll eat you
My bitch stay strapped - even Vinnie dame is lethal
I did a little bid for taking fucking change from people
But Diabolic did the motherfuckin' same, we equal
That's why people call the two of us insanely evil
And that's why people call the two of us insanely evil

[Hook]

[Verse 3]

[Vinnie Paz]
I scream "Allahu Akbar, murder murder. kill kill"
In the same sentence, that's why I'm incredibly ill
We better rebuild, and put the motherfuckin' pope in prison
For practicing remote-control socialism
But I ain't mean to get political on this shit
So give me a forty-ounce and pass the motherfuckin' biscuit
And do some type of shit I did that I don't wanna revisit
Y'all better tell the C-cypher that they gonna need ballistics

[Diabolic]
So keep your distance, cause me and Vinnie? We the sickest
We'll make you sleep with fishes like tsunamis from the east Pacific
I keep a spliff lit, guzzling this Belvedere
Chase it with a twelve of beer, and heaven fell, hell is here
Hell yeah, I smell your fear, and I'm your fearless leader
With lyrics deeper than the crater left in Hiroshima
So if you love Hip-Hop but saw the spirit leave ya
Me and Vinnie thought we'd bring it back here to see ya

[Hook]
