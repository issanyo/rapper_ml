[Diabolic Talking]
By the time you hear this…
You will have been fully offended
And all I'll have to say is…
"Go fuck yourself"
Blow your fuckin' brains out…
I'll see you at the crossroads…
And I won't have your fuckin' money so don't ask
And to my ex… where the fuck is my money?
And to all you people who are thinkin' about buying this fuckin' album…
…Don't
Coz' I don't give a fuck about you
And if you do buy this album…
Break the fuckin' CD in half and slit your wrist with it…
Or even better go home, kill your family with it…
It'll just give me more publicity
This way I'll be in the paper
You'll be blameing me for your suicidal phsychotic thoughts
And I'll be laughin' at you
While im spending the money that you used to purchase my CD
On weed and beer

Signing off…

- Diabolic

One love & fuck you
