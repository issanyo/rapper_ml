The will to survive is strong
Look inside thy inner self
Integrity that drives persistence
Constant strive dwells inside
Comfort zone, state to be alone
Deep strength unheard of
Harden feelings to be numbed
Emotions gone, hard as stone
To live on the dark side of the law
Lawless is the path of thy self
Flying free with dark wings I soar
The dark lord will conquer all!!
No one knows the hell I live
One day Satan will soon give
All the pleasures of this world
Matter of time, have my rewards
Staying true to the beliefs of
The motivation to stay alive
Death would be solution to some
Desecrate the criminal fools!
To live on the dark side of the law
Lawless is the path of thy self
Flying free with dark wings I soar
The dark lord will conquer all!!
Crutch for God need not have
I am God in my broken land
Believe in myself to crush all
Stand as one, I will not befall
Sheer fear of unruly law
Respect to the powers of us all
Without force war can rise
Violent streets can kill
Ganglands are taken over
Don't feel pity, out to kill
No remorse for the death
Kill all in the way
Terrorize, intimidate the weak
Uprise will survivors seek
Dark years, the sun is shadowed
Despair, misery of all
Decimate is the calling of sin
Committed to Demonic Evil
Evil...Evil...EVIL!!!
