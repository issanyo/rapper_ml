[Verse 1:]

Yo, I'm a liar and a thief with a fucked up outlook
Only truth I tell is what everyone knows about Bush
The rest of the time I lie, cheat and steal
I don't care about you, as long as I eat a meal
Why I keep it real, all the stacks I've earned
Was from stabbing people while they backs were turned
Smile in your face like I'm telling the truth
Can't believe you buy the bullshit I'm selling to you
I'm done with respect, put a gun to your chest
Ice grill <--(?), but laughing at you under my breath
I must've been the biggest scumbag on earth
Fourteen stealing money for weed out mom's purse
Came home, 3 A.M., playing the safe
She'd ask about it, I'd lie straight to her face
The truth hides inside the heart of a secret
I tell the same lie so much I start to believe it
Another lie to cover up the other lie
When I get my story twisted, feeling justified
I justify authority like so what if I put trust aside
And rob my friend who hustle pies
Like he don't need the paper as bad as me
He don't have a seed and just for that he'll bleed
I'd lie to my best friend for a bag of weed
I'd actually love to change, but hey that's just me

Chorus:

I'm a liar and a thief, why I keep it real
Ain't got shit so I lie, cheat and steal
Should I be concerned what my people feel
I don't care, as long as I eat a meal
[repeats thru Chorus - "Lie, cheat, steal.  All I do is lie, cheat, steal.  That's just me I...."]
[2X]

[Verse 2:]

I swear to god I'll never lie, you know I'm honest
Wait I told them I wouldn't steal and broke the promise
When I rolled up on this guy in a suit and tie
Like give me your bread and maybe you'll survive
I understand you with your wife, but it's do or die
So either do what I say, or you'll lose your lives
I must've had my head in the clouds and o-zone
When I ductaped a kid for a pound of homegrown
He could tell it was me thru the ski mask
He's asked why I draw guns for his weed stash
I said I don't know what you talking about
I got an alibi so charge me or I'm walking out
Running off at the mouth, 'cause now-a-days
I hear dope ??, and smell gold from miles away
How can I pray, I forgotten forgiveness
God as my witness, watching me robbing your riches
I stole from my own brother and lied about it
Also I can go to the mall and buy an outfit
I talk around it when I get interrogated
He like I can't even believe we're related
I turn away like I ain't concerned today
But mom and pap don't believe a word I say
And it breaks my heart that I play this part
Maybe I'll change but until then I'll stay razor sharp

[Chorus]

[Verse 3:]

Yo, I always let my whole life drag thru the dirt
Trying to find the easy way out, rather than work
I've been a drug dealer, thief, failure and more
In your crib taking whatever ain't nailed to the floor
I might care but nightmares infected our dreams
So I'm right there reppin' running credit card schemes
Getting our cream is the prime objective
In my mind what's yours is mine, accept it
The bread I've collected ain't an honest living
It's from lying and stealing without a pot to piss in
And maybe I can put down this gun that I aim
But doubt it 'cause really I'm too stubborn to change

[Chorus]
