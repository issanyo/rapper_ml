"And this is only the beginning"

Yeah
UGP
Foul Science

[Verse 1 - Nickles:]

Yo as the night darkens, the moon shines and wovles barking
Bums drinkin' booze, phenes hit the pipes sparkin'
We hustle the blocks, but watch for the D's hawkin'
They call us creeps, so move with proceesed caution
Goons, creaps, thugs, and freaks
Heroin, crack, dope, meth, X, and lee
Just a peek of the life on these New York streets
Pay homage to the [??], your life deceased
And peace to the real fucker, die if you fake
And stand tall, to all my dudes locked in a cage
Caught in a blaze, back track, I mastered the craft
I spit and talk about the things I've seen in my past
At last I've seen a vision and followed it with precision
Won't stop 'till my soulless vision will drop you to devil's prison
My intuition dig deep into where we live in
So forget the wife, friends and may continue my mission

[Scratched Hook:]

Days are shorter, nights are colder. Feeling like life, life is over - [4X]
These snakes strike like a cobra

[Verse 2 - Pot Bull:]

Yo be quiet son, I think this mothafucka right here
Dark forces turn your dreams into bloody nightmares
Streets fear no man in this Milky Way
Twist blades, skin fades and you piss away
It don't matter, brain matter gonna splatter the door
I got the option, to blow the fuckin' brain on the floor
I call out to Ev and even knock on her door
I'm on the porch, shut the lights off and crack my jaw
Turn the lights on, she soaked in blood and snot
We got cops runnin' numbers and patrollin' the blocks
It's hot like butane, over a 1000 degrees
While they rollin' with the sleeves up and burnin' these trees
At ease, we can't do it cause I'm trapped in hell
Another day, another body on a locked in cell
And raise hell, like Satan on the day that he fell
With the virgin Mary suckin' dick and sniffin' a rail

[Scratched Hook]

[Verse 3 - Diabolic:]

Another day another body droppin'
Papparazzi clockin' life in the fast lane
I'll run in Maserati's [???]
Got me plottin' on somebody poppin' oxycottin
Watchin' how it leaves him shakin' like Muhammed Ali boxing
Boxed in by cops, shotties cock shots like Bobby Johnson
To get me out the show, they got me locked in quick as Johnny Cauchran
Free like Olly olly Oxen,I'm insane
I want John McCain and Obama slained like Saddam Hussein
Watch 'em hang as warn and tellin' haters
My back's against the wall like callin' corners in an elevator
Excelorator to the floor of this Ford
Bring the war to your door like it's Normandy shores
Diabolic, make you superstitious like some voodoo witches
With politicians hangin' off in verti crucifixes
Stupid bitches, I'll be laughin' before I just shatter your jaw, like it ain't matter at all
