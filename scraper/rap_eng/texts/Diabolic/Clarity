My memory is far out
Four wheels spinning
I still gotta dig the car out
I found nirvana on a small couch
Part of me is all out
The rest of it is all in
The recipe is falling
Visionary caution
Don’t visit very often
Coughing
Got five digits on the coffin
Tossin'
Turn into the villain
In the Gotham
Awesome
Whole world spinning on the clock in
Punch out
Lunch in
Skip that production
Grown up discussion
Own up to something
-nah, I’m too busy
With a whole bunch of nothing
-yeah ,hold that assumption
Bubba Gump Trumpin'
Level up something
All out of punch ins
Goin on a hunch
Since I had to learn something
-still awake
So i gotta burn something
Still a dream
So i gotta earn something
Still at work
But u gotta know something

-new kaleidoscope
In everything that i have wrote
Heaven spoke
Told me that my shit is dope
Never knew
-where it never grows
Head to toe
Tagged
This Rosetta Stoned bag
Talk to heaven and than let us know
Back


[Hook:JadeGritty and Tab]

As far as i can see
I got things i need to be
I got god inside of me
I got angels up my sleeve

As much as i don’t know
I got plans i got to go
I got demons on my soul
I got evil in my bones

Taboo:

For years I feared the mirrors reflection cause the clearest perception just appeared as deception no accountability through these years of deflection I wasn't hearing the question cause feared steered the direction

I read all the chapters but they were ordered backwards the reaction to the deep hurt was knee jerk automatic  ... The more I thought about it I saw it was sorta tragic cause I know I need some patch work on my moral fabric

I've know that shit since I was Fourteen I also know u ain't shit if u don't war scream for your team Making my way Wading through a sea of Lost dreams Scooping out huge buckets of fuck it from my thought stream

Cause it's Too much; so sad too nuts; gonads a nomad that travels around the parameters of his note pad I go and smoke dabs then rifle through my vocab to find the words to define why I hold onto to what I don't have

Just tryna wear my insides on the outside so I can walk around with out pride and see where the doubt lies...tryna see without eyes and navigate my way by the loud outcries of the egos who've been  down sized

So I walk around corners of the earth what they offered me is worse I wonder what all of this is worth I don't feel comfortable calling this a verse this isn't getting up, it's falling in reverse
