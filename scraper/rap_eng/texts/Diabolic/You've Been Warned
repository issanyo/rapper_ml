[Verse 1: First Amendment]

I'm A
Devil's Advocate Chanting Raps That Are Blasphemous
Chatting With Black Panthers And Blasting Chapters Of Nazareth

Backslapping Fans Who Don't Know What My Twitter Handle Is
And Leave Your Family Standing Around A Casket With Some Candles Lit

I Take Action Make Or Break A Contraption
Obliterating Snakes Who Are Faking Making It Happen

Save The Date When I Rape The Game Into Fragments
Incinerating Hate Cuz Assassination's My Passion

Going Kamikaze My Code Is Like Hammurabi
Leave You Floating In The Ocean Right Next To bin Laden's Body

Put A Hole In Your Dome Like A Lobotomy
Your Whole Squad Is Known To Be Studying Knowledge Of Sodomy

Way Ahead Of My Time If You Notice In Every Rhyme
I Make Mental Notes Of The Greatest Rappers Of All Time

Every Line Designed To Expose The Depths Of My Mind
And Speaking Of Greatest Rappers Soon That Title Is Mine

This Is Just The Beginning Of Verbal Murder And Sinning
I'm Kicking Writtens With Visions Eclipsing Verbal Precision

So Ask Me How I'm Living I'm Not Swimming In Women
But These Little Gifts Given Are Serving As Ammunition

Continue Ripping These Clowns Until I Drown
Disconfiguring Contenders I'm Injuring Every Round

Swinging Haymakers Creating Thunderous Sound
And If You Wanna Take My Flavor I'm Selling It By The Pound

This Rap Shit Is So Easy It Ain't A Thing To It
Your Wife's Pussy Is Greasy I'll Stick A Blade Through It

Jesus Christ Is My Third Cousin Who Knew It?
You Should Know That Me And Satan Bleed The Fucking Same Fluid

[Hook x2: Diabolic]
Ciphers under street lights
Party on the rooftop
Boondocks with my goons
Beats on my boombox
"Rock on!"
Till the break of dawn
When the due drops
You already know the flow
So here we go

[Verse 2: First Amendment]

My Favorite Time Of The Day Is When The Sky Darkens
So I Can Shine My Blade And Wait Until The Knife Sharpens

I Use Handicapped And Crippled Kids As Practice Targets
If I Practice Long Enough Eventually I'll Be A Marksman

The Wrath Of My Violent Siren Can Never Be Avoided
Perfect Timing Family Crying So Fucking Disappointed

Throw You In The Cage Of A Lion With The Muzzle Pointed
You Can Break My Spine And Think I'm Dying But I'm Double Jointed

Rappers Know That I Got The Hold Of A Vice Grip
And You Should Know That I'll Roll You Over A Spike Strip

Whenever The Sun Dies And Night Falls I Write Shit
Sick Enough To Pop Both Of Your Eyeballs With Ice Picks

The Crack Addict Fanatic Is Back At It
You Got A Real Bad Habit Of Sticking Dick In Your Ass Faggot

The Mathematic Advantage Subtract Add It
I'm Laughing At Whack Rappers Imagining Us Inadequate

Living On A Planet Where Syndications Are Made Evasive
Sacred Information  With Slaves Chilling On Plantations

Native People Excluded From Raising Their Nation
Stuck On Reservations By Pagans Praying To Pages Of Satan

It Amazes Me How Racist A Slave Could Be
It's Like His Brain Waves Got Tangled Up In The Ancient Sea

Hit Up My Facebook Page And All You Slaves Can See
How Hatefully These So Called Fans Are Craving Complacency

You Lames Should Put Your Faith In Me And Start A Revolution
Instead Of Recruiting Dudes Who Are Fueled By Execution

Eliminate The Fools Who Pollute The Food We're Chewing
I'm A Student Of The Universe Juking Around Confusion

Now I'm Zooming From The Basement To The Ceiling
These Faggots Have No Answers For The Weapons I'm Concealing

I Stay Wheeling And Dealing
My Rap Style Is Revealing
The Way I Feel About These Cocksuckers Catching Feelings

So Stay Out Of My Lane I'll Probably Go Insane
If These Modern Day Rappers Continue To Ruin The Game

Fuck The Status And Fame I'm Here To Ignite The Flame
So The Back Of Your Lady's Throat Is Where My Sniper Rifle's Aimed

I Was Sent Here To Be The Saving Cure Of Humanity
You Just Listened To 3:30 Of Pure Insanity

You've Been Warned

[Hook x2: Diabolic]
Ciphers under street lights
Party on the rooftop
Boondocks with my goons
Beats on my boombox
"Rock on!"
Till the break of dawn
When the due drops
You already know the flow
So here we go
