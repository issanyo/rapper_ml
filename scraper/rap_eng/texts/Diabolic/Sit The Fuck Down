[Hook - Taboo]
You's a gold digging ho?
(Sit the fuck down!)
You only in it for the dough?
(Sit the fuck down!)
You getting live at our show?
(Sit the fuck down!)
You ain't surviving the flow
(Sit the fuck down!)
You only spit about coke?
(Sit the fuck down!)
You think this shit is a joke?
(Sit the fuck down!)
You got a spliff I can smoke?
(Sit the fuck down!)
Use this as a cloak!
(Sit the fuck down!)

[Taboo]
To what my crew has proven, you should be used to loosing
You was born immortal, reemerged from Earth to superhuman
We on strike all life 'cause it's our birthright
To serve as a search light for all those that thirst sight
Don't misinterpret this nigga's purpose
I was born with vision perfect to deliver a vicious verdict
In a quick breeze, I'll blitzkrieg your bitch steez
Now watch your lip bleed, 'cause you mislead with greed
So sit the fuck down before I break your teeth
Or beat you to death with a folding chair and make you take a seat
You can't fuck around, you ain't of a titan stature
Timidly torture insults, I throw bolts of lightning at you
Through musical bars I leave unusual scars
Take an AK to the sorcerers and shoot for the stars
You mad frail, check you while you opening fan mail
You can't test the great, you hold less weight than hand scales

[Hook - Coal]
You only talk shit?
(Sit the fuck down!)
Your crew will forfeit
(Sit the fuck down!)
You on some soft shit?
(Sit the fuck down!)
I'll fly your head into orbit
(Sit the fuck down!)
You ?? rocks sticking
(Sit the fuck down!)
You bitches ain't drinking?
(Sit the fuck down!)
You stack four figures
(Sit the fuck down!)
I'll force your extinction
(Sit the fuck down!)

[Coal]
Stay sharp 'til my tongue rust with one thrust to battle the unjust
Rambunctious bum rush
Crush the sun's crust 'til it becomes dust from one touch
As the lungs busted the lies your son trust
Caught among us, flung us to Earth regarding the worth
Of a worthless hurt, pardon the thirst, starving the works
I'm regarding the dirt
Carving the first verse in the heart of the earth
Part of the worst curse to burst
Versatility's ability verse disperse artillery
My stability's a formality
I battle to kill Satanic divinity with dynamic agility
Burn humility and turn tranquility to panic
It's automatic, spitting granite the size of planets
Burn organic matter to shatter ceramic data
That's like Mad Hatter when brains splatter, but rather
Stand with Jacob's latter to combat the cadavers

[Hook - Diabolic]
You politically correct?
(Sit the fuck down!)
You an industry exec?
(Sit the fuck down!)
You ain't giving me respect?
(Sit the fuck down!)
We're visibly the best
(Sit the fuck down!)
You a Midwestern gimmick?
(Sit the fuck down!)
Cats rapping timid?
(Sit the fuck down!)
I'll wipe my ass with your image
(Sit the fuck down!)
You motherfuckers are finished
(Sit the fuck down!)

[Diabolic]
Yo, I slipped out um roofies, screw these
Started a new breed that proofreads
The fine print and won't eat what you spoon feed
Testing fate, expressing my present state
Tryna dip from cops so I can pick the locks on heaven's gate
Stressing papes til dough doubled on a dro hustle
Go figure, now I beat gold diggers with they own shovel
On a cursed path, worth half my herb stash
Feeling pain that surpassed the worst rap an herb gassed
Y'all are curb trash, a disgrace misplaced
Defecate single file, get your shit straight
Don't make the mistake of fixating your eyes on me, I'm warning ya
I, my formula, I'll stick a saw to your cornea
This where trends stop and gems drop
Where we give inmates from gen pop a 10 spot to feed you hemlock
Your block's nothing, so stop fronting (faggot)
You ain't shit, you have butterfingers, you woulda dropped something

[Hook]
A snitch to the beast?
(Sit the fuck down!)
You ain't spit in the streets?
(Sit the fuck down!)
Try to shit on my beats?
(Sit the fuck down!)
I'll kick in your teeth!
(Sit the fuck down!)
You never shave your box?
(Sit the fuck down!)
Suffolk County cops?
(Sit the fuck down!)
You can't rhyme off the top?
(Sit the fuck down!)
Yeah, fuck with Triple Ops!
(Sit the fuck down!)

Sit the fuck down (x8)
