Masters to create
Gathering in the dwelling
Darken the imagination
Uniting of the minds

Forging forth we think alike
Absence of anything light
Blacken hearts we then begin
Ceremonies in the devil's den!!

Burning desires!!!
Unholy sinful lives!!
Practice the art of rage!!

Fearless for maximum cause
Reckless we captivate
Blasphemous immaculate
Dominance at unrest!!

Mindstorms and mania
Meditate to overpower
Vanquish sounds of the deep!!

Assault on your sympathy
Disruptive human nature rage
Unrelent the only way
On a razor's edge
The flame we keep
Pronounce to devastate
Supremacy behold!!
