My ears hear everything...
It's like fucking sonar!

[Diabolic]

I seen a satanic mixture amidst the Catholic scriptures
So I'm flashing pictures of the Pope selling gas to Hitler
Force feed 'em proof, 33 mislead the youth
I'm the culprit who slit his own wrists and bleed the truth
Bleed the deepest roots with twelve to oversee
Wanted to helm opposing three while Satan sells his soul to me
The devil's advocate rose from the dead a rebel passionate
A level pass this shit with a score to settle after it
Bush and Bin Laden plotting to end contact
Intense combat means defense contracts
Beyond that a New World's captive effect
Where Police scan the beast brand on the back of ya neck
With cobras bite attack and infect your soul for spite
Till I rose to life, a poltergeist shedding Jehovah's Light
It's a true story I explore the honest approach
Dance with the devil and slit his choreographer's throat

It's where we at - you, you, you and me
It's a crew of three serving the truth for you to see
It's usually right there in front of your eyeballs
Walk with me, wake the fuck up before the sky falls!

It's where we at - you, you, you and me
It's a crew of three bringing the truth for you to see
It's usually right there in front of your eyeballs
[Walk with me] wake the fuck up before the sky falls!

[Tabs]

Look through the windows of my soul you see the pain in my eyes
But you will really feel my pain when fire rain from the skies
So embrace love before you get a taste of these fake thugs
Drowning in the great flood of snakes blood (learn to swim)
The truth is vicious most of y'all turn superstitious
Been bothered by the sins of the Father and the youth it visits
Useless gimmicks try to limit the legends airplay
Beyond live, I'll swan dive off heaven's stairway
To teach man about they deep plan
To have us on C-SPAN receiveing thr beast brand in each hand
The concept of freedom is a complete scam
United we stand on our own while they clone our gene strands
I march my legion through the darkest of regions
Snake rattle at golden apples in the Garden of Eden
What I fierce sight when I grab the spear that pierced Christ
War chants towards your camp, watch demons run for dear life

(Hook)

[Coal Cash]

Invitation for you to stand in the grand book of life
Through the son's sacrifice cleanse myself in blood of Christ
Till my garments turning white, my divine might and mind's plight
Don't need your words of hindsight
This finite type of equation gazing at a new world invasion
Society of JASON's got my heart racing
Facing world extermination through my sperm's germination
Trilateral connections, elections run my Masons (all day)
Revelations, Counsel of Foreign Relations
Where devils take vacations at Camps David's location
Try my patience but I'm a firm believer
That the leaders in Geneva, prophesize like I was Peter
Strong as stone, AIDS was made in the club of Rome
The silent plague that was made to invade ya home
They're making clones, cell phones carry the low jack
And George Bush Sr. was the first person who sold crack
Hold that, I'm just here to spark the beef
Tell you right now Star of David - mark of the beast
With six triangles times three, start to believe
It's not the Jews just Pharisees and High Priests

(Hook)
