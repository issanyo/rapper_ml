[Intro]
-I was all alone, thats how the "easy target" came along
-You had no one to... to back you up?
-Nope, nobody...


[Verse 1]
Meet Joe, quiet type just an average dude
15 an outcast to the kids at his school
They took his silence as him Having an attitude
So the bullies there would whoop his ass every afternoon
Last Tuesday, he was just waiting on the lunch line
Patiently, minding his own business when some guy
Came from behind to put him in a sleeper hold
While his boy punched him in the face and couldn't be controlled
They threw him to the ground kicked him while he's down
A crowd formed around him laughing, calling him a clown
Now, he just laid there with teachers broke it up
Teary eyed, nose bleeding, eyes swollen shut
His parents picked him up, his Mother caused a scene
And Joe went from picked on to being quarantined
His father seemed ashamed, he could tell by how his face looked
Kids started rumors and harassin' him on facebook
Pain changed in his brain waves and became rage
8 days later payback was all he maintained
He had enough, finally he snapped
So he went to the drawer where His father kept his gat
Put it in his knapsack and took it into class with 'em
Looked at everybody lookin' at him and started blastin' 'em
12 dead laying there as Joe fled
To the lunch room and put a bullet in his own head. (BANG)

[Interlude]
-from the inner lasting affects of childhood bullying
-I literally didn't know why they were being so mean to me... and they would just say  well you're fat...


[Verse 2]
Meet Jane, slightly overweight and insecure
16, good grades, classmates are immature
Concerned with fashion, boys and who was rich or poor
They pointed at her and laughed when she walked in the door
Last Monday she was just getting dressed for gym class
Cruel girls called her fat said she needed Slim-Fast
She tried to ignore these hoes talking bout' her weight
But couldn't help the tears from running down her face
Feeling outta place she ran out the locker room, to avoid ridicule Cuttin' class was opportune
It's a vicious cycle, went from A's and B's making mom proud
To self medicating, hangin' with the wrong crowd
Another helpless teen lackin' self-esteem
Beaten down by mean girls like it's on the silver screen
She became a fiend, for oxy's and percocet
Ran away from home, her mom's a nervous wreck
She started losing weight eyes sunk into her face
Pill's got too expensive he began shootin' H, made a few mistakes
Now she's way beyond the wrong route
An all out thief, stole jewelery from her mom's house
Walked out focused, headed to the pawn shop
Got paid, went to cop and this is where it all stops
People she had gone to cut a kilo of it wrong
Found her dead on the couch with a needle in her arm
