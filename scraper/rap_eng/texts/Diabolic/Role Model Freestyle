Uh hu, Diabolic
DJ Scully (ha ha)
We 'bout to bring it back
(man, thats right) Ain't no fuckin' role models
Uh hu, c'mon lets go

I paper chase
But my razor raise the stakes
I made mistakes
But at least I ain't make racist tapes.
Face to face y'all can't fuck with me
So you do shit behind my back
Like cops handcuffing me
Now hows it feel waking up fake as fuck?
Cause I'm real
So I know you don't feel the same as us
I'll gain your trust as fam, then crush your plans;
And take advantage like I'm shoplifting the upper hand
Puffing grams of haze while I rant and rave
Tap dancing on land mines, juggling hand grenades
I wanna pop pigs and split a cops wig
Drop hits and pop cris', like I shot Big
And back slap the hardest rock in the parking lot
And beat him to death
Like we'd race to see whose heart would stop
I'm blessed with talent displayed in the bars I drop
But I don't give a fuck if I become a star or not
Look how far I got without compromise
Thinking homicide, looking at my baby mommas eyes
While snitches squeal I'm real personified
Living amongst thieves wondering when the honor died
With an angry mob who got you thankin' God
But we were sidetracked when we found a bank to rob
I'll stab and shoot you
No blanks involved
And put a bullet in the same place the shank is lodged
He'll be choking on blood
The only sound you'll repeat's
The same bubbling in the background of the beat
I'm angry at hip hop
Cause now its just weak
But Scully going to bring it back like he found the receipt
Carjack Tim Westwood, catch a court case
And fuck up his drop
Like slick Rick doing four tapes
I'll make your favorite rapper cancel tour dates
Like R. Kelly, getting sprayed with a can of pure mace
So if you in the studio, watch the booth
Before I cop a squat and drop a deuce on a labels top recruit
Obnoxious youth with cops in hot pursuit
Who you think I watched to learn how to cock and shoot?
I'm a liar and a thief
So murder is instinctive
Firing the heat
Like my burners got a pink slip
I've seen the coldest day broke and paid
With Satan fucking up the angel on my shoulder blade
With a loaded gauge I won't just take your life
I'll father your kids, move in your house and date your wife
So pray to Christ I don't chug a whole bottle
And convince the kids I'm the role model to go follow

Motherfucker, diabolic, foul play motherfucker, DJ Scully
We gooing to bring it back
