[Swifty McVay]
You can feel this wrath
It makes me laugh
How it's easy to snatch your cash with no mask
An evil demeanor
Leave out jeans and flip flops
With a bloody wife beater, see me
In front of your house wheezing
Squeezing a pistol
In the other hand it's a pitchfork
I'll hit ya
With accurate precision
That means I ain't missing
I specialize in splitting wigs from a far distance
20 years, I can spot a bitch nigga by listening
To his tone and rhythm, stop kiddin'
You ain't hitting nothing
I could interrupt your session
With the push of a button
While you up in the booth cussing and fronting
Your shit won't happen
While I'm grabbing a mag you reach for your pen and pad
Nigga I ain't no bitch
I break the mic over your head while your engineer is screaming in high pitch

[Diabolic]
After years of evolution moving inches
My DNA evolved to a superhuman sickness
Short circuit in my brain
A few computer glitches
Act a fool, snatching jewels and crucifixes
In the music business, eating some crumbs
Creeping the slums
Waiting for the reaper to come
Mix weed in my lungs with a liter of rum
And I'm possessed by a demon
Speaking in tongues
Unforgettable dope
Twice the medical dose
Got you feeling the beat like you're checking it's pulse
Expecting results, no federal notes
Hoes ripping off their clothes like The Incredible Hulk
So I'm letting the folks know I'm usually calm
Burning trees like Napalm, through Vietnam
A short fuse wired to a nuclear bomb
Smacking Primadonnas out their Louis Vuitton, it's on
