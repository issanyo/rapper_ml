[Intro]
*Coughing*
Hey, another day...

[Verse 1: Diabolic]
Yo
Woke up early on my born day, 28 ain't a blessin' though
My bills are stacked up high and my funds are gettin' low
I'm set to go up-to this shit-hole local bar
So I can get some peace, plus they don't over-charge
Order my first shot I'm sittin' there all alone
Some piss warm Cuervo coz' I can't afford Patron
They say I crossed the line coz' I don't need no salt or lime
And I smell the liquor before I take it all the time
Got problems on my mind, some I can't handle
Time for shot number two, gimmie' some Jack Daniels
It's how I cope, pressure hits, I go get a brew
And after two honestly I'm in a better mood
Round three I got that Jameson's Irish whiskey
Then I put it back and yeah I'm feelin' kinda tipsy
This busty bar tender lookin' better by the minute
A few more and I gotta say I'd slide up in it
So I'm like: "Yo, come here miss, be friends with me"
Then shots four and five are double-fisted Hennessy
I should let it be, I'm gettin' rowdy poppin' shit
Time for number six, but wait yo, I gotta piss
Took a leak, took my seat, now I'm tryna flirt
But the Henny's repeatin' on my every time I burp
Then the bitch told me six she was buying back
I said surprise me, big surprise, another shot of 'yak

[Hook: Nate Augustus]
I'm far too proud to cry, and refuse to taste my pride
Everyday's the same so I drink to hide the pain inside
So it comes to pass my time, when I breakdown and say goodbye
I begin to close my eyes, hide the pain inside

[Verse 2: Diabolic]
Now it's eleven on the dot and I want my seventh shot
Some ice cold JÃ¤germeister would just hit the spot
Threw it down and said "yo bartender do a round"
I think that was eight, I'm drunk so I'm losing count
Vision kinda spinnin' but still I want another
Now the bitch looks like Vida and I wanna' fuck her
I called her over but god-damn my mouth was slurrin'
So I was like fuck it, "just bring me out some Bourbon"
Took my ninth and looked at life in another light
I went from happy too "Imma' start a fuckin' fight!"
Thoughts were runnin' like "I hate myself nowadays"
I'm really broke and my seeds a thousand miles away
Baby mama always gotta bring that same drama
"Yo bartender bring me back a shot of straight Vodka"
That's number ten but at this point does it matter?
I'm half a father, half a sucker, half a fuckin' rapper
Half-assed and half the time I'm just a drunken bastard
Who smokes so many cigarettes I got a touch of asthma
Ordered my eleventh E&J. and with the quickness
Took it and told the bitch "I'll be back in twenty minutes"
I went outside, threw some punches and hit the wall
Knuckles bleedin', screaming till I trip and fall
I ain't got shit at all, and I don't even love myself
Fuck it, I ain't going back in, here's number twelve

[Hook]
