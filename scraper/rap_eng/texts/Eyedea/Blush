[Verse 1]
She thinks sex might blur the lines
I’d be goofing at her clothes
She’d smear ‘em to death fly paradise and calls a castle home
Come on her own
Come on her own
Come on her own
Come on her- cold can rescue, broken blood vessel crush

She thinks her doctor's Jesus Christ
She must not like my song
She paints a side and picks a fight
Like's to show there's better cold
Come on her own
Come on her own
Come on her own
Come on her- cold can rescue, broken blood vessel crush

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
She thinks sex might blur the lines
She’d rather bleed than blow
Come on her own
Come on her own
Come on her own
Come on her own
Come on her own
Come on her own
Come on her own
Come on her- cold can rescue, broken blood vessel crush
