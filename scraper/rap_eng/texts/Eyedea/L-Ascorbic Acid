"Hey you!"

[Verse One: Jack Cracker]
O.J. captains will locate the action
Shogun assassin of flows got 'em clappin'
Raps are lumpy, big, fat and chunky
Yes Jack is funky, pass the brass monkey
Write till my wrist hurt, throw mud, kick dirt
Big hurt, big breath, exhale, windsurf
My twist strip the screw
Scripts look for you
The kid rip your crew
This switch is true
Quick to grip mics, kick this just right
I just might snap like noses in a fistfight
The older I get, the colder I spit
Roll on these beats like a deodorant stick
Uh
Grease the gears in-between these ears
Listen here before this shit disappears
Got no standard rhymes, use no camera lies
I like the street cred to have violence to glamorize

[Scratch Hook]
Hey you
You're losing, you're losing, you're losing, you're losing your
"Hey you"
"Party people"
"Break it down like this"
"Hey you"

[Verse Two: AD]
Back at it without black paddocks or rims
Or selling rocks to crack addicts
Again
But I still hustle
I'm slanging a disc and I stay in the crib till I'm making it hit
I am making a fist
And I'm waving that bitch till I'm breaking my wrist
To my grave where I sit, I'mma stay on my shit
Every stage, every set, every place that I rip
When I flood the spot, monks love to rock
I pump up the spot to jump up a lot
Untuck your cock, pull up your socks
We're gonna do this for the heads from up the block
To the heads that run the shops
To the heads that don't untuck the Glock
To the people boiling in this melting pot
We living through it even though it's sweltering hot

[Scratch Hook]

[Verse Three: Eyedea {Carnage}]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
M {M}
C's {C's}
Or hollow store
{Filler, I'm the iller resort killer unadult-}
-erated, made a melody out of metal
For mangling mentally under developed partisans of my ass
{Every time I could snap
Though don't even need a proper track to rock in fact
Just add a [?] wattage amp}
[?]
{I'll knock the gnats off a black cool caucus cap with a [?]
Spot the wack
Why is that?
Blaacka blaacka clack}
The walking Glock is back
[?]
Is that minister fine to [?]
Time to rhyme into your mind and blind vision her
I'm the prime minister of combined sentences
Climb to my pinnacle, find your rhyme miniature
{Two badasses leave talentless challengers stricken with paralysis
And calluses on how I gotta live}
Most think this rap shit's a joke
{Fat nigga though}
After the show
{Leave your heart take her back [?]}
Your rhyme passes revoked
Assess will quote
Maze pushing for the masses that wanna see you choke
{The majority?}
No
{Each and every rapper leashed}
Nothing short of the {fantasy of masterpeice}
