[Intro] (spoken)
You are about to embark upon a fascinating adventure into well-being
A journey which will leave you with a lifetime method for gaining unequaled health of body and mind, and the sense of a new life

[Verse 1]
I'm here to break my own ball and chain
Hoping the plight to be completely sane
Nothings to gain if image blocks the only chance for change
When I expand my range the world stands as judges
But don't think music defines my character
These songs ain't me, they're just documentations of momentary thoughts
Nothing's set in stone just because it's sold or bought
Your expectations need a category of placement
But a renaissance man sits nowhere particular
Every seed is vacant to a song writer, comedian, method
Actor, author, emcee, carpenter, producer, engineer, shit talker
Hustler, musician, architect, businessman
Student of the scene and human being if you give a damn
No matter what side you see it's just one side
No matter how much you think it means, it's just one side
My depth is only as shallow as time and space is
This is just one of my many eternally changing...
