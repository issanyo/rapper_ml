What would you do if it happened tomorrow
Would you consider it the end of the road or the beginning of a brighter path
What would you do if it happened tomorrow
Swallow the contents of that glass and get up off your ass
Let a razor touch your viens to bless skin of the red stain
Keep your head sane
Bear the pain
Continue playing just a game
Would you say fuck the game out loud
Would you be proud
Would you believe
Would you breath
Would you still see above the clouds
Would you speak about the subject
Or keep it all inside
Would you look eye to eye with the problem
Or would you decide to hide
Would your dreams be destroyed
Heart never beat the same again
Would you struggle to see the opening, focusing, of where the rain gets in
Would it be a different color
Would it just ache
Would you touch the state of fluctuating emotions
And notice you can't even sit up straight

What would you do if it happened tomorrow?
Quit your job, grab a bottle, drive your pride and crash your sorrow
Would it even wait up for your mind for an hour total
Or another daily article leaving you partially startled
If it happened tomorrow could you adjust to the thin air
Don't ask me i won't know until i get there
What would you do if it happened tomorrow?
The eyes of today only see it till we fall asleep
What would you do if it happened tomorrow?
My eyes can't see it but my ears can hear it calling me

I've done a good job convincing myself i'd be ready
When i jumped in I understood the load was heavy
If it happens tomorrow would you understand
Have an another plan
Maintain your health
Blame yourself
Blame another man
Touch the sand
Of a brand new land
Holding entirely in a closed hand
Fire, with a desire to show the world where you ran
I bet you would if you could
But not everyone can
And whose going put the tear soaked coat back together
So you can wear it again
What if you woke up to it?
Would you rush through it
Would your tear ducts be working over time
Would it blow your mind?
Or would your soul confine
Choke and cringe
Provoke a sign
That hoped and shined
Through those broken vines
What would you do if it happened tomorrow
Would you consider it the end of the road or the beginning of a brighter path
What would you do if it happened tomorrow
Would you push away the glass and try to live in the past?

Yo when it comes it comes so no hard feelings
Its gonna happen anyway
So i suffer from it until then
Imma die anyway
So why die until then
We all die anyway
So i may as well build until then
What would you do if it happened tomorrow?
The eyes of today only see it till we fall asleep
What would you do if it happened tomorrow?
My eyes can't see it but my ears can hear it calling me
