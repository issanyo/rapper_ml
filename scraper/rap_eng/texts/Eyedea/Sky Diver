Verse 1: Eyedea

Use your fist, please don't knock
My loose teeth are yours to take
Cuddling our new found freedom
In keepin' our eyes open without being awake
Kiss my ear, the faint still taunts
Children rejoice 'once hero now dead'
One last time, I'm really hurtin'
Just a little taste to take off the edge
I rummage through old love letters and photographs
In a desperate reach for a clue into who I am
But with only the distant past as a reference I fail to feel any connection to the bones under my skin
You can cry but you're still gettin' sterilized
Can show the sun how to come if you know the sky
He'll let you make a mess if you keep him high
It was a good shoot, the messenger deserves to die for his lies
Make it hurt
Scare me straight
Cursed is he who can't burn by fire
We're all falling, show me feeling, I'm your designated diver
I can see the cuts on your mind
Your mother made yours, mine made mine
I know you'd rather be sad than stupid
Genius by day
Junkie by night
By the grace of breeze I never scraped a knee
That didn't help me see bleedin' isn't what it seems
Let it steam, let it steep (Let it sting, let it steam) 'til it screams 'finally free'
Then you better leave
I bet that she's gonna kill the king

[Verse 2: Eyedea]
Doctor wound, perfect numb
13 billion years in the making
Black hole in the center of a galaxy
We're still suffering, we're still aching
The sanctuary is closed for repairs
I used God's guide to paint a maniac the nice way
Bad habits make for good memories
I'm good at being at the wrong time in the right place

Crust and clots at the corners of her mouth
Eyes white like yours but completely different somehow
Caught her post dose looking like a ghost
Cheeks-rosed from the flush of fluid so familiar to us now

Legs folded, the predators' prey
There's no messiah that wasn't a slave to it's brain
If I could do with nails what you do with words
There'd be one more crucifixion - one less open door

Use my fist, but I won't knock
Break it open, itch me sober
Trust me: we'll get out of this alive
Now take my hand it's almost over

I apologize for lying about smiling
I'm a frightened little cat that learned to act like a lion
While Leviathans beach in the grip of their patience
I'm driving this cheap pirate ship to the pavement

By the grace of breeze I never scraped a knee
That didn't help me see nothing's really what it seems
Let it steam, let it sleep 'til it screams
"Finally free", then you better leave
I'm aiming right for the head of the king
