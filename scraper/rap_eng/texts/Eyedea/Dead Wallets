[Verse 1: Sinthesis]
Reaching down, reaching out, now in touch, out of bounds
Bodies on the grass, paying homage to the past
Massive allergies...To social functionality
My antipodeans (?) and hints of interacting impotence
And innocence...Guilty of a conscious common sense
Listen and a take a taste of your prize, a proper proprieter
Picking at a piece of the prize at a rising price
Holy implication, enough to make the sickness ensue
The thought of suicide would make these faces cry in denial
The vile apathy, smile happy camper you
Knew that the brace was just working gloomy afternoon
Overcast addicts asking for abrasive broom
Lock loaded, livid living isn't as impressive
As an interest, in the cynic sadist sinister divine
Leaving behind flowers on forgotten landmines
Like sand through the hourglasses of time

[Pre-Hook]
Sewing the grace in the skies, as well as the hate in the eyes
Breaking the legs if they're racing to pride, it was I, I, I
In disguise I sign a sniffle, globed and open
Riddle me this, if we've been easy to find there's a twist
And I'm lovin' and rubbin' 'em out on death
Betting up on my broken chips
The feet relieve the ground, the head resembles clouds

[Hook]
Deep inside you can hear them lie to you
Say goodbye to the lie you never knew
Deep inside there's a lie that you can't hide
Clutchin' dead wallets...Say goodbye

[Verse 2: Ecid]
Bathing in a naked sky, ducktaped to my inner eye
Surrounded by shiny black suits, base chides, and flags raised high
W-w-why was there something inside the disguise?
A motive, undetected I venture expressions instead of wise guys
I'd follow the sun if my clouds weren't so stubborn
Instead I crawl to the couch and embrace my lovely rugburns
I believe I'm convenient, and for whatever reason I'm leaving
My favourite reason of breathing to trees reason to breathing
The fumes of these humans, ten miles behind my latest witchery unit
Feeding poison scapes and I'll see you in
Whatever the hell you want to fucking call it
I stole a dead man's wallet and moved to small town Indiana
Where everyone's a fan of meth and mesh bandanas
So it's probably best I don't get friendly with locals
Which is just fine to me, cause now I have more time
To sculp my (?)
And be nothing more than a memory, 'til everyone forgets me

[Hook]
Deep inside you can hear them lie to you
Say goodbye to the lie you never knew
Deep inside there's a lie that you can't hide
Clutchin' dead wallets...Say goodbye
Deep inside you can hear them lie to you
Say goodbye to the lie you never knew
Deep inside there's a truth that you can't hide
Clutchin' dead wallets...Say goodbye

[Verse 3: Eyedea]
I've robbed myself of the ability to see the mountain by focusing on the mole hill you made and telling you all about it
Now you tip-toe around, careful not to awaken the problem
As long as it's asleep you call it solved; all flaws forgotten...
Step within a mile, you can smell the self-loathe
Death of an only sundial
Made touching hell helpful, meltdown
Burn up, side to side, ache
Lovers know each other, how'd it feel when you imagined my face?
I hurt, strangled by the money dirty bloody taste
You hurt, but we live to fight and fuck another day
Shut your eyes butterfly and trust the skies
I had enough of my shit too, your flight plan is justified
I'm not sure I feel as awful as I act
But Romeo never got his way by faking a laugh
I'm making this puzzle one war at a time
Yours truly, my only and beloved falsely mine
