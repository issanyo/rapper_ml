Kristoff: Take the scenery all apart
Take the scenery all apart

Eyedea: I've seen your dreams how they start
I've seen the seams rip and fall apart
A part of the path
A heart skipped a beat when you laughed
Now the algae in this pond spawned what human beings became
And they will be part of everything that lies beyond

Kristoff: Stabed into parts, now we're still a (?) born
The despair in the darkness, nobody seemed to care
And after a while as a small child, they called me a boy
They gave me all the dessert and they showed me all the toys
But boy oh boy, I did not think(?) it's where I needed to go
I felt it hurt and I needed to grow, so I proceeded to show
Every part of my insecure self that I didn't ever think
Could be on exposure to the world, and everyone I assume was a ghost
And that's why my desires have overcome my passion to live
If you ask me why I took the wrong direction my reaction was sin
So I can't blame to judge you or, or even try to touch you
But I want to tell you that even though you're invisible that I really still love you
And I've always have. Your're not sure how we're related
But it's the reason that you feel ashamed when you look in the mirror as you see yourself naked
Depleted at last,  no energy
You try to laugh but you hold it in
You proceed to think the external world's the enemy
But it knows that you'll live through anything
And I believe in you and that's why I'm here today
To understand that you are me and I'm putting your fear on display
So if we both decayed today, it's fine, nothing will stipulate the disintegration of all mankind
Would you live? or would you be fine...
