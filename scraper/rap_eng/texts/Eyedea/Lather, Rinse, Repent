(This one right here is old school)

I have no comment
I'm not your heaven
Unless you cut yourself into pieces I can understand

Die for your causes
I'll be your witness
You don't always bore me
It's just that you can

They fly around my bones
I can't even escape them in death

Find the one who makes the grass green
Then it's off with his head

I have no comment
I'm not your heaven
Unless you cut yourself into pieces I can understand
