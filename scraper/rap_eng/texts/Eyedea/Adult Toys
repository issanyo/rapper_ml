[Verse 1 : Carnage]
Kill everybody in the cypher
Strike ya when I wipe the _
Earth off me - from the face of the Earth -
I'm facing the worst motherfucking part of me I ever saw
Forever raw with it
My jaw split it
Every time that I come raw with it
Raw with it - with it - roll raw - never soft -
Saw the way that I bring it back
Cut you like a saw
And when I leave you in I believe the men who be deceiving them

[Verse 2 : Eyedea]
Agh, this is just for me enough of me to get a touch -
Just - uh - one adrenaline rush - a little less blood
Head rush, head rush, 'til I'm dead - what?
'Til I get up - and I can stand up front

[Mazta I]
Tell them motherfucker's all the secrets that I wrote
Chasing, represent, they stopping us, hope
This' the way, we try to see them grow
We go the speed of light, they came slow

[Kristoff Krane]
Agh, everybody in the crowd's got their hands around their throat
I hope they haven't got his Adam's apple, I'm hoping you don't, choke
Oh no, here we go, don't provoke
Don't evoke, I'm 'bout to blow

[Mazta I]
I don't move my pelvis like Elvis 'cos my daddy gave me belt whips
It's all good 'cos I know who the king is - I know; believe it's...
Good night sweetheart, hope that you get home safe
'Cos if not, then you might get forgot
And you body might rot
And decompose - and watch a bunch of roses plot
Some hang off trees outside De La Car
Steal shit; don't you like me and my squad?
Dread represent like, here goes Chris Krane
