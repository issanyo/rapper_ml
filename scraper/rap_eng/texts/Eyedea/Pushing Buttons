[Guitar chords]

[Verse 1]
I dug deep in my system to find nutrition for others
Lost sleep, tossed and turned, only to learn love is expensive
Talk was cheap, till my thoughts grew feet
Now I take them on walks with me
But I don't let them off the leash
Cause they might cross the street and get hit
Listen a second, I pretended to need a friendship
With many forms of energy till everyone repented
Now I'll end this with a sentence and a sense has become a way of life
To stay the night with my notebook, then wake up the next day to write
Again, and again, and again and again and again and again
Until my pen is inevitably inseparable from my finger skin
Lingering in the depths of a pool caressing this jewel
Fighting a million and ten inner battles that'll sprain my neck in the duels
Bobbing my head to keep cool, true, stays on the down low
Meaning proof for the bleeding, isn't useful in the council
Meaning it's cheaper what you believe to be the dopest at the moment
I'm exceeding the quotient and feeding me tokens
But the machine must be broken

[Hook]
Cause I'd rather give him a uppercut than give him a hook
So he steady throwing jabs just to get him to look
Man, every thought he ever had quietly sits in his book
For anyone that's afraid to jump, let me give him a push
Cause I'd Rather give him a uppercut than give him a hook
So I'm steady throwing jabs just to get him to look
Every thought I ever had quietly sits in his book
For anyone that's afraid to jump, let me give him a push

[Verse 2]
From the North side to the South side, to the wild side to the pesticide
To the genocide to the homicide, you decide to set aside
Well, pick a side, any side, are you along just for the ride?
Oh me oh me oh my, I wish you would just die
Cause kid, you're the reason for my sore throat
Petty mortal, the war won't stop till you hop in a porthole
And sort those problems out, child, it ain't all about your style
Cause you could break your back to state the facts and make them smile
While the pain in my religion, painting by the pigeons
Straining while you're listening to my brain on tire ribbons
Giving a splitting headache with energetic delivery
Living as a poetic shredded by the edge of misery
Vividly describing the pain inside of this entity
Physically and mentally, we all pretend to need sympathy
Interesting enough, you say you don't give a what
But there's much I grew to like through this mic that I clutch
So keep your hands down, and put your attention span up
Understand now, man, sound is a dimension you can't touch
Plants crush, when the vocals of that local named Eyedea hit your ear
So kid ditch your chair and stand up

[Hook]
Because I'd rather give him a uppercut than give him a hook
So I'm steady throwing jabs just to get him to look
Every thought I ever had quietly sits in his book
For anyone that's afraid to jump, let me give him a push
Rather give him a uppercut than give him a hook
So I'm steady throwing jabs just to get him to look
Every thought I ever had quietly sits in his book
For anyone that's afraid to jump, let me give you a push

[Verse 3]
But bury my mind with a friendship bracelet and a tin can
Get your business down and dig me up outta the ground when you get rich, man
I'll take a round of applause, but won't take no kids hand
Cause the challenge tonight is to balance my bike without a kickstand
Now a spoon full of sugar makes the medicine go down
In a room full of hookers, well my head isn't in town
I consume what you, shoulda, and assume that the lookers
See the moon and the fact they pushing you to do more than push a broom to
Cushion
Tune rolls to your head, and enables you to see
There really is more to life than busting nuts and smoking weed
But we proceed to say it ain't fair until we got gray hair
But next time I ask you to think, please don't give me a blank stare
Now take care!

[Hook]
Yo, cause I'd rather give him a uppercut than give him a hook
So I'm steady throwing jabs just to get him to look
Every thought I ever had quietly sits in his book
For anyone that's afraid to jump, let me give you a
Give you a, push it up now, push it up
Push it up now! Push it up
Lemme see them hands, people (Push em up now!)

[Abilities - overlapping Eyedea]
So push it up now!
So push it up now!
So push it up, so push it up now!
