Its October 23rd
It's a funny word
I touch the herd on the grass that's grazin
Crush my words touch me make it feel amazin
Let's keep looking stuff up and plug the wires in
Until it sets me on fire until life finally gets inspiring
I'm tired and I can't sleep, hungry can't eat
Come walk across the country with me bruised toes and feet
No one sleeps and no one knows the incomplete
I saw the bird speaking from the beak and I didn't know what to think
So I kept traveling kept it ongoing
I kept babbling as I kept on raveling this long hole I'm in
And there's no way to dig out, get out of my way
There's no thing that the kid can live out of any day
So let's play with the video games and the individual pain that paints the paint in your brain
It's the same as mine is, tie this, time is not existent
Because space is traveling past that be persistent
Ask if you are going to die
I know that you're high that's why I'm low on the ground looking up at the sky
That's where I caught your eyes divided in the clouds
I never provided anything that I didn't think was purposefully for now
And there's no smile no frown no town
Nothing that is a mountain that's broke-down no sound
Let's go around this is a ghost town
And now how can you try to just get on trial by jury, hurry up and die!
That's what they're saying but what I am displaying
Is just a part of me that makes me want to cave in
And I can't take it
We can turn the volume up
We can turn it down
It doesn't matter what it sounds like the, brain will still turn around
And as it paints and scrapes the inside of the skull
The dull becomes sharper images in this victim-less thing I pull from
So numb, full, come broken and stuff
Wanna give it a little touch?
I fold the bill, I know what's real
Gold rush, adrenaline rush, just a pill
Touch the ceiling, fuck your feelings
You're just a puppet string, now kneeling
Melting down the candle wax and I can't handle that
I'm damaged back jumping on a camel's back I understand the facts
The planet's flat that's why I don't believe in the round
Circular while I'm leaving it down
Perpendicular to believing in sound
I'm leaving it now I bleed in a frown
But I achieve a new smile
Every time that I climb up pull another trick up my sleeve
I'm a child that believes in magic still
It's not a tragic accident that happened it's just a rapid skill
Firing out of my neuron connections
You're on to something that you're off of so what's next man?
