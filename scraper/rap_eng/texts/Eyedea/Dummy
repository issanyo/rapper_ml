[Verse 1]
It’s a bitter taste
Rubbing alcohol
Pulling me together
Just to let me fall
If it makes you happy
I’ll stone myself
In the name of ugly - touched in a dirty mouth
I’m a copycat
I’m a lying dog
Open ended friend
Fill the cut with salt
You can take me now
You’ll pay for it
You’ll make me yours
You make me sick
Pet me inside
Wanna feel your burn
Momma should’ve loved you
But you never learn

[Chorus]
Yeah…

[Verse 2]
I’ll please you
I’m a hired gun
I’m your pin-up daughter
You’re s’posed to eat the runt
Broken circuitry
Press developments
It's my machine, give me liberty or give me death

[Bridge]
Yeah

I’m where?
I’m where?
I’m where?..

Homesick…
Come on…
Homesick…
Come on…

Homesick
Come on…
Homesick…
Come on…

[Verse 2]
What’s the nod again?
I’ve got silver skin
Wings and no stomach
I’m a perfect dummy
Hide inside disgrace
‘Til I float away
Pretty’s so ugly
Pretty’s so ugly
Pretty’s so ugly

What’s the nod again?
I’ve got silver skin
Wings and no stomach
I’m a perfect dummy
Hide inside disgrace
‘Til I float away
Pretty’s so ugly
Pretty’s so ugly
Pretty’s so ugly
