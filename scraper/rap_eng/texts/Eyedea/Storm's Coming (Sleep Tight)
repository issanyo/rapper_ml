Storm's coming was the talk of the truck stop restaurant
Settle up the green and sky's coming close
Buckle the baby down
Mufflers sound like cellos tuning
Wind like a theremin
She dreams cartoon mice barber shop quartet serenade:

Sleep tight, baby
Sleep tight
Sleep tight, baby

Outside it's my shitty car silhouette
Backlit by lightning
Then came the flood
Road fills with mud
Mouth fills with blood
It's time that I tell you where the angels come from
I promise to keep you warm 'til they arrive

Sleep tight, baby
Sleep tight
Sleep tight, baby
