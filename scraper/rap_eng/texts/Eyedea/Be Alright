You never heard me say it's easy to be positive
It's obvious, regardless of your problems you gotta live
There's probably no way I'll always be a candle
Cause on a cold day, I need a warm place to stand too
Bulurry vision lets me know it's past my bedtime
As long as i'm living, I got a fair chance to get mine
Only a week until the deadline
But I've been through a whole library of words
Trynna make hell and head rhyme
I'm just another voice confined to your background
But when I stood up they sat down, who got the last laugh now?
Let's push the manual, can't look back at when the hand shook
Stand on a planned book, forgotten and rottin' with the canned goods
They won't lend you a shoulder, they think we're miniscule wimps
I learned as I got older, it don't exactly get simpler
I'm breathin' the germs, I'm teachin' to learn
It'll be me and my mic until the scream is adjourned

[Hook]
Everybody has their troubles but that's life it is a struggle
And I just wanted to shed a small light cause it ain't all good
But it's all good enough, so I'mma be alright, alright?

I know it's hard to keep on thriving when you only feel like crying
But I just wanted to shed a small light cause it ain't all good
But it's all good enough, so we gon' be alright, alright?

Everyone's got issues, don't be pissed if I dismiss you
Man this is seri-, happiness leaves my fingertips too quick
And I wish you would quit resistin' the system
Sendin' missiles to my system repetition
But if you keep whittling on the same piece of wood one day it'll be gone
And I'll be stabbin' my palms for the last ten songs
If my passion strong, won't be lastin' long cause
I'm crafting lines without a mind to cast 'em on
Put my emotions in alphabetical order
I looked at the ocean and saw nothing but water
I needed to use the phone and didn't have a quarter
With my devotion I was able to motion forward
When you're out in the open you can still feel cornered
Haunted by the ghosts in the depths of your soul, tortured
Don't know where I'm going but I'mma head for the border
All I need is my close friends and a few supporters

[Hook]

People show no sympathy to your problems
They think it'll never happen to them
They're living in a fairy tale quite magical
When reality hits 'em, they got the nerve to complain
Like they're the only ones in the universe it ever happened to
Haven't you ever looked around and felt the frowns?
I smile now cause I know how to look up when I'm down
But it's hard to live in a rainstorm and pretend it's sunny
While we all live in the foundation of puppetry
I scream "revolution!" in attempts to make a difference
I see no solution to the sickness outside of listsenin'
Your eyes listen by descision
But to use my imagination will disrupt a few of the caskets that's awaitin'
So in my notebook there's a riddle and as I write I giggle in sorrow
Reflecting the painful grin, but don't think I'm laughin' at you

I ain't laughin' at you
The world's laughin' at you

[7x]
And I'm just laughin' at them

And he gon' be alright
And she gon' be alright
And they gon' be alright
We all gon' be alright
My ma gon' be alright
My pals gon' be alright
Your folks gon' be alright
My folks gon' be alright
And he gon' be alright
And she gon' be alright
And they gon' be alright
We all gon' be alright

Alright, alright
