[Verse 1: Phonetic]
Phonetic is an alias i use on stage
When i betrace my thoughts
And you embrace them
The music i make
And its beatiful tonight
Cause when people come and find us
They generally just like us
Ready to light up
We all gotta ??
Tonight we giving up on
How difficult our life was
Put it in the glass
Put it in the glass
Now it in your system
Who said you couldn't dance
???
Now see the people in front of the stage
Makes me believe that we come from same place
Postive energy ???
They call that hip hop
But its not that simple
??
We got a lot to lose
And less to gain
Gotta let it loose
Cause stress in pain
??
??
Let us entertain
Put your plams to the roof
If you feel the same and

[Hook]
Bounce bounce bounce bounce put ur hands up and bounce bounce put ur hands up and bounce bounce bounce bounce  come on bounce

[Verse 2: Eyedea]
Main line the wires
Use my pain to inspire
The brain to light a flame and set my cold heart back on fire

I indulge my vice like it's my only option
Pair of eyes cutting holes in my skin
That's how I know you're watching

In paradise I drink my water like shots and my whiskey like wine and I'll probably never stop

The exhilarating rushes, debilitating

Doesn't matter if it's love or lust
No matter what, I'm still escaping

Break me open maybe you'll find something there
Between the clown shoes and makeup there's someone who still cares

I don't mind if your hands are in the air
Folded in prayer or wrapped around my neck
I'm just glad you're here

It makes me feel a little less alone
Helps me through the mess
Lets me confess where I was wrong

Tell it to the guitar
Tell it to the song
I tell it, dealt it, felt it
Went to hell with it now it's gone
