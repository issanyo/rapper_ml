[Intro: Eyedea]
I want us to keep the head space
Your eyes rolling into the back of your head, I like that
That's Beautiful. We the head the space, we keep the head space, we keep our heads space. How does my head taste? Well, how does my head taste? I want to know how does the inside of peoples heads taste
That's what ya' got
Great! (Kristoff Krane)

[Verse 1 : Eyedea]
All you've got is, one light
One more match
How long is this illumination gonna last?
I can't take it all the way back because I'm still breathing and weezing through the same demon's mask
Don't even ask, spend the last weekend
Not swimming in the bottom of a glass in the gene pool;
Just start thinking
And then you'll understand
And then you stand under
And then you over-stand, overthrow the whole plan and they wonder why you did it
Well try to be committed
The light is still flickering, I'm still listening
The position stays the same, the chairs' arms mold
But we're still infested with the bar codes; tomorrow knows
I have sorrow for everyone who doesn't grow
The sorrow grows in me so it makes the rest of me not grow
So then we're in the same place and they feel sorry for me
But, I'm so hollow, they can't follow the freedom that breeds it's own breathing

(Are you guys laughing?)

[Verse 2 : Eyedea]
Don't laugh, don't laugh, I'm here on my behalf
Let's split our genetic code down the road; you can take my half
I've grafted, grafted, I'm plastic, my mask; I can't breath and so I gasp
There's no need to even ask
I fall asleep and then I grab
Onto the math
The mathematicians, the specific historians that have passed
All the different boring Kevorkians storing glass
Blade shattering lights and it's all in my path
It's on my path but, I don't feel much wrath 'cos -
It sits, it makes the whole position backup, then I ask what you came for
My brain's sore, the rain pours, down on the same head but I stand upside down and walk on the floor
Walk on the ceiling of the brain that's peeling back, I wanna see the insides -
Wanna see the insight, wanna see what you lack
But if you lack it, it's OK don't stay passive
Practice that and eventually you'll understand how to land right, flat, on a mat, and understand the back
And the front and the sides and the sides, and how to hide from your pride when it's time to open your eyes
Knowing what's wise is not necessarily wisdom
And if the world's gonna die bury me with them, I carry my vision; it's scary but there it is; incisions
Apparative, a parentless, sexless, scentless; my apprentice is barely embarrassed by the, cherished moments, and so it exploded, I never load it
That's why I hold it
