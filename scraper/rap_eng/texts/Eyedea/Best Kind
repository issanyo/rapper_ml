[Hook: Slug & Eyedea]
S: Here's to the friend's I've lost and the one's I've left
E: And here's to the ears that want something to digest
S: Here's to the small population that's got my back
E: And here's to the robots that can't see past white and black
S: Here's to the Newfie cuties, come and get me
E: And here's to the hometown hoodies in the twin city
S: Here's to my man Nool and his drunk friend Andrew

[Verse 1: Slug]
Here's to the good times, and the good rhymes
And every cat that shook my hand after I took his or he took mine
I put life in the mic - for what that's worth
Plus I turned out to be the type that always wants the last word
There ain't no pieces to a dream on my keychain
But I got the secrets of the ages, on the papers in my briefcase
And if I could see straight, I'd of drove myself home
And if you really was a B-boy you'd have a cell-phone
I seen my share of war, mess em' of their royalty
Watch the soldiers jump off the dock to test their buoyancy
Took a drink from the gauntlet and passed it left
And waited for the master of the class to catch they breath
Oh wow, now you got freestyles for days, right?
But a lot of cats that got flows can't write a song to save they life
And I can't figure out, what you're talking about
Try to do it - after you take your man's unit out your mouth

[Hook: Slug & Eyedea]
You tryna get paid, now that I understand
Cause if a man's to have a family then he has to have a plan
And I'll be damned if I do, and I'll be done if I don't
Still I keep my heart tucked under a thick winter coat

[Verse 2: Eyedea]
From this day on, I'll never be fooled by a fool
Always be cool with the rules, and never eat food by the pool
See, I'm not here for the amusement of you
I stare right through with a clue
And appear as the student's of who? No one
I asked Mr Notebook "do you care if I doodle for two minutes?"
I knew that he knew and he didn't refuse cause he's true
I neutered a few, went to the moon with a flute
Flew on a broom into the future and came back with a pair of shoes and a crew
Drew a blueprint of a new computer - super human
And opened my eyes and noticed that I was alone in my room on a stool
Yeah - I'm a loser. (Yeah, I'm a loser..) So why don't you kill me?
My tooth hurts - and due to your blood squirts my school shirts are filthy
Skills seep from a closed mouth - quilts keep the cold out
The hills steep - Let's roll south
Until we can prove worth, to the whole house cause really
My soul's mouth is ill see
It can move words, at, oh about two/thirds light speed
Silly, Mic's bleed, Fancy amounts of glow in the dark kool-aid
Which was the gas to drive over the hump of my flow and it starts today
You say life sucks, so you refuse to touch tomorrow
Read my bumper sticker, it says "death is better cause it sucks and swallows"

[Hook: Slug & Eyedea]
S: Here's to the kids that don't need me to tell them how to live
E: And here's to one's that have it all and still find it in the heart to give
S: Here's to my peeps that know to look before they leap
E: And here's to the lyrics and beats that makes life complete
S: Here's to all my folks that don't let life kill they hopes
E: Here's to the man with the mic in his hand that walked away with a sore throat

[Outro: Slug & Eyedea]
S: Here's to you, and here's to them, and here's to me
E: Here's to you, and here's to them, and here's to me
S: Here's to you, and here's to them, and here's to me
E: Yeah, Here's to you, and here's to them, and here's to me
S: Here's to you, and here's to them, and here's to me
E: Here's to you, and here's to them, and here's to me
S: Here's to you, and here's to them, and here's to me
E: Here's to you, and here's to them, and here's to me
S: Here's to you, and here's to them, and here's to me
E: Here's to you, and here's to them, and here's to me
S: Here's to you, and here's to them, and here's to me
E: Here's to you, and here's to them, and here's to me
S: Here's to you, and here's to them, and here's to me
E: Here's to you, and here's to them, and here's to me

[Dialogue]
Slug: Ayo, Nool. Was that best kind?
Nool: Yeah man, that was best kind
Eyedea: Yo man, What is best kind?
