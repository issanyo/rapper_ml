Ayo, Abilities man *Yo what up?*
Yo, I got a lil' somethin' I gotta get off my chest right quick
*Spit it out, spit it out, go ahead spit it out*
Alright dig this man, I'm sick of all these punk motherfuckers in this rap game
You know what I'm sayin? *What's happenin' fool?*
I'm sayin' these fools steppin' up to us knowin' they shit is straight  ga'bage
You know what I'm talkin' about, E&A don't play that shit man
*Why don't you explain?* Alright, check it out...

[Eyedea]
It's like we walk into the place and instantly we surrounded
The kingpin, big shots, of this underground shit
In less than a sec Abilities is at the bar
Half these guys don't even know who we are, but we still act like stars
Your set could'a been tight, I wasn't listenin'
I was peepin' out some new lyrics my man Carnage was kickin'

[Carnage]
Forcin' this contortionist towards blowin' kids
Physicals over inproportionate coordinates (..damn that shit is hot)

[Eyedea]
Now back to the subject, to me not givin' a damn about you
This is my world, it just so happens that you live in it too
But that don't mean I gotta tolerate your talk
There's a thousand other people in this room
That'd probably love to hear your thoughts
But while your uncomfortably ridin' my tip
Abilities is upstairs stealin' yo chick
You want props, stop runnin' your mouth
Just give a pound, buy a CD, and be out
Yo, you need to take a few steps back
Your DJ can't scratch and your emcee can't rap
You all up in my face and we just came here to max
Man you stupid motherfuckers need to learn how to act

"Ayo, ain't that that Eyedea kid, talkin' all that crazy..
Man I'm 'bout to hyperbolate this fool, you can't see me!"

Ever since we started winnin' battles and travelin' 'cross the land
Fools think if they could beat you they could beat you and
They wanna test so they step not knowin Eyedea's rep to leave 'em swept
Up off they feet, the contest always ends like this:
-Your cheap flimsy chump style ain't worth the ground it'll get buried beneath
-The beats are buckin' your weak, flowin' your flow is scared of the beat
-Princess, the king's here so play the background
-How's that sound? You just got clowned now sit your ass down
Man these kids get on my nerves, but I can't pretend I hate 'em
Cause whack emcees are such a great source of entertainment
Me and Abilities watched the Blaze Battles for like a year:
"This kid out there, got nothin' to do"
Heh, it's funny, sometime's kids is so whack with the rappin
Instead of actually rappin' back I just wind up laughin' like
*haha haha haha ha haha ha haha ha ha ha*
Yo, you need to take a couple steps back
Your partner can't scratch, and your cousin can't rap
You all up in my face and we just came here to max
Man you stupid motherfuckers need to learn how to act

"Oh my God, Eyedea & Abilities, you guys are soo phat!
My boyfriend loves you guys soo much
You know what? Oh my God, you should sign my tits
Oh great, this is gonna be perfect!"

You know we love to see ya'll at the shows
But this is dedicated to the ones someone might call a *ho*
All I gotta do is wink to get you back to my hotel
I can't respect a person that don't respect themselves
You're that one girl I went to highschool with
Back then you treated me like I wasn't shit
You say if I give you a free CD you'll show me your tits?
You get the CD for ten bucks like everyone else you stupid *bi-yotch*
*No* I don't care if you just broke up with your boyfriend *No*
I ain't tryin' to go where every other rapper's been *No*
If I was to kick it all my boys would clown so I could
*Never hold you, can't hold you, won't hold you down*
Look all you gotta do is learn some manners
Women and men, DJs and rappers
There's nothin' more to say, this meeting is adjourned
And if you don't know by now *I think it's time you learned*
