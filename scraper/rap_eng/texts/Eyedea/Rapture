(Playstation 2 Introduction)

[Hook]
I stand alone
Burned every bridge over the troubled water
No longer hiding from my personality disorder

[Verse 1: Nalyd Ecitsuj
A stronger tide is coming and I've been running
Trying to function fine with out my mind
Climbing out this fucking corner
I was born a thorn away from rotten petals
Forgotten rebel passed through the absence of heavens wholesome hands to develop an evident level of benevolence
So it's probably better I sold my sold to the devil
This is a message to anyone I met that thinks they know me
Don't pretend to understand any of the issues that I'm holding
I was in a rush to grow up, so yeah look Mommy no cuts
Just a stomach disgust, and the fear that I might go nuts this year
If I don't swell up I'll see you one my way
One day this shit'll kill me but I guess that it's OK
I've lost all fate in a world so full of hate
I don't fucking love music I just use it to escape
I'm caught between wanting to punch someone in the face
And putting a bullet in my head to leave the human race
Everything takes its toll but there's no tolls I can take
I haven't yet found a good reason to stay awake
Introducing the corroded bones I had behind my smile
I'm angry at the universe for the way she treats me now
And keeps me down, stealing all my energy
I'm feeling like my enemy, concealing my identity not dealing with my tendencies
I peel the skin and then I squeeze the real imprinted Hanse's disease
Not human in this century, I'm ill until the entity
Who built this penitentiary for me It's filthy as a centipede and guilt was in his sense cause he was willing to
Just let me bleed, While I wore a game face
10 years later I'll be in the same place
This planet is just an overpopulated mental hospital
Each zombie walks around constitutes another obstacle
So here it is I'm finally coming out my shell
All 18 years of my life have just been in conflict with myself
I'm insecure by every faucet of the existence
From my addictions, to the conditions I choose to live in
Who you kidding I suffer from excess anxiety
A product of pollution in American society but I somehow keep the sobriety
Stare into my eyes and see the hell that burns inside my mind plus I no longer have an ego I can hide behind
But I've been trying disregarding my insanity
Every form of hurt isolates me from humanity
But it's provoked against being force fed
So Fuck education for a decade and 3 years of headaches from my peers
Cause now I realize I could have learned more on my own
They taught me how to know everything except my soul
Which is everything I need to grow
Everything that keeps me whole
So I leave with golden hope
To rip the beast that holds my focus
But the fact remains the same, I'm still bound by chains
It doesn't matter if your chain is 10 feet or 100 feet
The fact remains the same, you're still bound by chains
So people say I've changed, and it's harder to relate to me
Good, I never liked you for our friendship was make believe
I'm peeling the mask back and revealing the rap distortion
Feeling my organs drilling distorted short portions
Of morbid machasanistic acid keeps the torture unfortunately crafted
Interests to orbit my portrait and inflict my image with disorder
The minutes get shorter, the walls start to close in
Feels like the brain is hanging on by one clothespin
I've hidden in the darkness for too long
I make it look all right but inside its so wrong
I want life to change but I don't know if it can, For a man or machine or whatever the fuck I am

[Hook]
I stand alone burned every bridge over the trouble water
No longer hiding from my personality disorder
No longer hiding from my personality disorder
