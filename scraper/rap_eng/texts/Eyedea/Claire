If there's a place where nothing grows apart
Take me there with Claire
If there's a place where nothing grows apart
Take me there with Claire

Keep trying to convince myself I'm over it
Keep trying to tell myself I'm fine
But if there's a place where you get a second start
Take me there
With Claire

If there's a place where I never broke her heart
Take me there, I swear
I swear
I swear
I swear

Keep trying to convince myself I'm over it
Keep trying to tell myself I'm fine
Never thought you'd leave me all alone like this
But I made the bed
Yeah I made the bed
So I guess it's mine

But if there's a place where love isn't so hard
Take me there with Claire
If there's a place where she never broke my heart
Take me there with Claire
