Yeah, he used to shoot it in the air for kicks
Promise he had perfect aim, swore that he couldn't miss
Wore it underneath his belt because by law that was his right
Besides you never know what type of danger's hiding in the night
He said he'd never use it in a fight, he'd take a punch instead
And it made him feel at home, he used to hunt with Grandpa as a kid
As time went on he started to think more and more about what he would do
If he was home and someone kicked down his door
Paranoia kept increasing
He kept imagining a tragedy, as if it was inevitable trying to prepare himself
For how he'd feel if he ever had to steal a life to save a loved one's or his own
That soul-less piece of metal was the boss in the relationship he bought it to keep him safe
But it just made him sick
And it wasn't until the day that he got rid of it that he felt like
He was safe, no longer a slave to that piece of shit
