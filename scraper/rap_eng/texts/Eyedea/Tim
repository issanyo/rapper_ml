[Tim and his Mother arguing]
(Tim loads his gun and shoots himself in the head)

[Verse 1: Nalyd Ecitsuj]
I see the hurt when I look into your eyes
How you struggle to hold it and keep it bundled inside
It drives a dull blade deep in my heart; it makes me want to cry
So I offer you a hand to help wash away the rainy skies
I'm running out of words, but I haven't yet made my message clear
So if none of this makes sense, I just want you to know Tim that I'm here
As a musician, as a friend, as a teacher, as a student
To grow and realize that everything's in constant movement
Each problem that we face is just a part of this movement
It seems helpless, but if we stick together we'll get through it
And return to the essence from which we've been uprooted
And wake humanity from these illusions
The second you can look into the sky and see your own reflection
Tim I'm telling you I know tht when you're headed in the right direction
The river ride ain't always smooth, but with it I live
And everything is perfect, just the way it is

[Hook: Nalyd Ecitsuj]
Timmy, what are you gonna do
When those walls start falling down
Falling down on you

[Verse 2: Nalyd Ecitsuj]
Tim you gotta learn to see the beauty in each moment of life
Everyone has different paths and we're seeing the light
The world is divided between peasants and kings
But the truth is everybody looking for the same thing
Now I want you to know, The role you play is part of the whole
Without you it couldn't be, and I mean that with compassion
Look at this house of yours its been window smashed and your childhood has been cracked in half with busted floors and holes in the wall
So if you ever need anything, I mean anything at all
I'm here for you; all you gotta do is ask timothy
I'm here for you, in the same way that you'd be here for me
Each person is an intricate piece of infinite
I feel like if you could see what I see
Then we as humanity could be free
I'm here for you, not for any self centered reasons
I've been put in this place too Tim trust me  I've talked to the demons
But reality is different manifestations of one single mind
You ain't isolated from the world Tim, even though it feels like that sometimes

[Hook: Nalyd Ecitsuj]
Timmy, what are you gonna do
When those walls start falling down
Falling down on you [X2]

[Verse 3: Nalyd Ecitsuj]
We're all born into this river without knowing how to swim
And eventually we learn how to keep this water under our chins
Some times this river is so cold to be in
Freezing my soul, solidifying my skin
Regardless of how far I see, I never see my travels end
Were carried by the current, being driven by the wind
The scenery we pass, we'll never see again
So we store it up as memories and don't let go of them
We're under a spell thinking the river should go straight
We set goals and desires to control our own fate
But all the pain we experience is a result of our expectations
Because it's the rivers nature to twist and turn
The shit can burn
And I know it
I have the same conflict
But I try to sit and flow with this rivers natural process
And sometimes when I watch myself float downstream
I see the beauty of it all, and it feels like a dream
And at that time I appreciate the rivers course
Some call it God, reality, momentum, force
I stare up at the naked moon, and she stares down at me
Outside thoughts boundaries I'm all I look outward to see
The universe is not something separate from yourself
I know you feel alone, but that's why I'm here to help
I know you feel alone, but just look up at the stars
And everything that is out there is what you really are
Each passing day opens a door for a better tommor'
