[Verse 1]
I'll never forget that day
The reflection of the cave in the river
The day we accidentally broke the models
Dead, alive, asleep, and awake and genuinely afraid -
That there would be no tomorrow
I didn't see it coming, I must have been blind
I never knew that space existed without time
It's just some places that you're not supposed to find
In the deep, dark halls of the mind
You're never not you; that's the trip
And these zombies walk around not comprehending how it feels
To float in a realm where everything is nothing -
And you consider taking your life just to prove death is real, well
There's no devil outside the three of us
We hadn't wrote nor talked about it, we didn't need the stuff but -
We paid the fare, and we took the train
Three teenagers, helping each-other go insane

[Chorus]
We were so excited for that day to come around
Just wanted to have fun like your average high school clown
No words can explain exactly what we found
And the walls came tumbling down
The walls came tumbling down
The walls came tumbling down
The walls came tumbling down
Came tumbling down
Came tumbling down

[Verse 2]
You guys know
That no one outside us'll ever understand
Truthfully I don't even think that we do
It's like thinking about thinking
And watching your head orchestrate a reality with the absence of ego
I can't explain it...
I can't find the words
The world probably thinks we're disturbed
But when I stood upon those rocks, I was in Hell
And ya'll were both there with me
By your faces, I could tell
And I admit, it was dangerous
We could have fell behind a trapdoor and never got out
But the fact that we did
See, that means we're strong
And the experience was all well worth it, no doubt
We never have to go there again
Maybe we only made it back by pure luck
But if I was asleep my whole life, when I finally woke up -
At least I knew that existence was nuts

[Chorus]
We were so excited for that day to come around
Just wanted to have fun like your average high school clown
No words can explain exactly what we found
And the walls came tumbling down
The walls came tumbling down
The walls came tumbling down
The walls came tumbling down
Came tumbling down
Came tumbling down

[Verse 3]
We ain't ever gonna look at anything the same
Perception, animation, happiness, pain
I still feel like I'm sitting on that bench
And nothing around me makes sense
I remember the rain in the night falling right before our eyes
Horrified in a universe, we don't recognize
Let's not alter our nervous system for safety
Let's just watch ourselves paint ourselves in this painting
It's crazy, but at least now we know it
We can put together a puzzle with the piece we unfolded
The brain's a fun house, a madman's playground
But I know myself, that's something I can really say now
I hope you both, feel the same
Each personal Heaven, can breath forever
And if we're insane, fuck it; we're insane
At least the three of us are insane together

[Outro]
... And the walls came tumbling down
(Left taste, smell, touch, sight and sound.)
... And the walls came tumbling down
(Everything was never not nothing, and you're never not you.)
