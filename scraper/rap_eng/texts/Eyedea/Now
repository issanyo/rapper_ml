We're here to
Bring the people and the music and the movement all together now

We see through
Repetitive etiquette and the highly unoriginal

We're here to
Bring the people and the music and the movement all together now

They will lose
Check it out now

This is a necessary change from the grim simple and plain
Gotta exercise that brain to break the chain pain is a part of gain
No need to explain
We innovate to generate an intricately interwoven tapestry
Of musical and ethical epiphanies
The industry is minimal
I'm on an awesome lesson with an angle
That can take it all the way to where the sun is
Like a runner loving running
Sun I'll turn it through a simple simile
Simple sentiment adrenaline is coming back
I'm in the innercity, where they die to be a superstar
I'd rather be a galaxy
But how you see is so dependent on the medicine the rhetoric
And how inventive any second of your thinking is
I'm sitting at the brink of this
World is all asleep and I have no apologies
I breathe
Keep my sight on what we ride on
Let bygones be bygones
The migraines don't sidetrack
My final destination nothing rivals predetermination
To exterminate the germination
Of a nation that accepts anything that's thrown in its fat face
'cause when there's nothing left
There's no more point to the rat race
We don't waste a minute of the day
Hope you can figure what I'm saying
Tryin' to send it all way to another stage
A creative alternative rated and greater
The crazy maniac, melodies gettin all up in your face, wait
Success ain't only based on self esteem
It takes a sense to differentiate between
Whats yours and someone else's dreams
I felt the screams climbing up my cold spine
Saying now's, the time, gotta give it all my energy
To get rid of the enemy I said it's so

We're here to
Bring the people and the music and the movement all together now

We see through
Repetitive etiquette and the highly unoriginal

We're here to
Bring the people and the music and the movement all together now

They will lose

'cause music ain't good if it ain't got style

Sick of the same old thing

Free us and touch what we can't see
Twist that knife and watch him bleed
Lost inside its way too deep
Someone choke me
Help me breathe

With nothing but space
In front of my face
Iâ€™m no longer running in place
