Purest Disgust

(Sapient)
It's like, how can I spit it if they don't relate?
Lettin' it culminate, till it's too heavy to pull the weight
I hunger for more yet my soul is caged
Under floorboards hiding from solar rays
But, I feel calm and at home in the darkness
Submerging my skin, feeling cold and lethargic
In a paper ocean, floating on paper boats
I paint my disgust in slow and graceful strokes
My war machine is well oiled and tuned up
Cooped up in a small room with its wounds glued up
I keep no glove on its hand to hold the poison pen
But I keep a hood on my head to hold the voices in
I will never confuse divine with human lies
Buddha shrines or that which is computerized
I am the unrooted vine that grew despite its wilted fate
And learned a serpent in a suit and tie is still a snake

Chorus

This feeling, this feeling, it's the purest disgust
This feeling, this feeling, it's the purest disgust
My bare feet have killed the worms in the mud
The dirt and the bugs were the closest thing to my circle of trust

Verse 2 (Ethic)

And I been factioned to make this
Distaste innovate ain't passed up a day yet (??)
I stay busy crashing they spaceships
Walk around rocking the glasses from "They Live"
Stay above water like the bay bridge
Never been a part of somethin I couldn't relate with
Never caught up, automated bravado making plates shift
When y'all are outdated like a tape deck
I'mma make you make sense, they gon make you think less
I make music even if music don't make rent
And it ain't been a beneficial state
That we in, the ceiling's high but the floors are thin

Chorus

This feeling, this feeling, it's the purest disgust
This feeling, this feeling, it's the purest disgust
My bare feet have killed the worms in the mud
The dirt and the bugs were the closest thing to my circle of trust

Verse 3 (Eyedea)

Baby shoes for sale, never worn
I add my own salt to the wound and croon inside the self inflicted storm
Make a promise I can't keep, bleed for your amusement
Cut me, love me, stop and crush, fuck me with confusion
Loose ends tie me up and rape my motivation
Break my teeth into dust and go to sleep clothed in blood and semen
Every day's a Saturday night
I waved my right to play fight with daylight the second the sun saved my life
Hurts me so good when it's going in my vein
I gotta leave I'll let you know if the seizure's sweet as better pain
You keep on spreading crazy all over this worthless town
A fingernail couldn't find the dirt underneath your surface now
You are my sweet and my sour
If it stays this deep I could cheat death by at least an hour
Let me go with my blood, poisoning my brain
Let the morphine drip drops and self inflicted rain, ok

Chorus x2

This feeling, this feeling, investing it all, back to the wind
This feeling, this feeling, of getting it all back when you win
This feeling, this feeling, investing it all, back to the wind
This feeling, this feeling, of getting it all back when you win
