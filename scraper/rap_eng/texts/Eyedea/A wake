[Verse 1: Eyedea]
The leader of the drug cultures
The leader of the country
The root of all evils buried deep within the money
Society's a machine a puppet with invisible strings
While we dream the eye in the pyramid sings
The wings we're born with were quickly clipped to fit the form
We're kept warm and senseless, your shepherd's relentless
Every genius was considered a madman in his time
From Jesus all the way down the line to Einstein
And people are so naive to believe
They chose their frame of mind
You're conditioned so you don't provoke
While the plan is in the prime
That's why things like alcohol were designed
I'm not paranoid, you're just blind and that's fine
If you never wanna find out who invented the game
And told you can only use 12 percent of your brain
Nowadays if you believe in aliens you're perfectly sane
But a century ago a thought like that would get you chained

[Refrain: Slug]
At its beck and call, let's set you all up against the wall
At its will, will even kill or be still my beating wrecking ball
For his enjoyment, we'll toy with what you perceive
Till you not only get the point but till you believe

[Hook: Eyedea & Slug]
[E] Burn the books, push the heroine, assassinate the speaker
[S] You need some dream sweetener!
[E] But I ain't asleep no more!
[E] Throw the scientist in prison and legalize free thought
[S] You need some dream sweetener!
[E] But I ain't asleep no more!

[Verse 2: Eyedea]
Why do you think marijuana's illegal?
Because it's green? Different? And not good for people? (No)
It's chemicals access a dormant circuit of consciousness
Which could potentially change the brains thought process
And why don't the government want you to change the way you think?
Because if you thought about what they do then you might start a revolution
So their solution is to try to stop its circulation
Paying millions a year cause they fear its provocation
They did the same with peyote, mushrooms and DMT
And prohibited scientists to experiment with LSD
They put Timothy Leary in prison because he used it
But the CIA secretly tested it on college students
They stripped the product from the natives and the highly educated
Then put it on the black market so the users would be aimless
With the right guidance, we could benefit from all of the above
But if it's not there, it's just a drug

[Refrain: Slug]
At the request of his greatness
We filled in all the negative spaces
With void stamps to stand on
Some hands-on experience
Stampede extravaganza cautionary gone and heeded
By the majority of the uprooted seedlings

[Hook: Eyedea & Slug]
[E] Burn the books, push the heroine, assassinate the speaker
[S] You need some dream sweetener!
[E] But I ain't asleep no more!
[E] Throw the scientist in prison and legalize free thought
[S] You need some dream sweetener!
[E] But I ain't asleep no more!

[Refrain: Slug]
At the emperors request
We've undressed all the children
Stripped the process of the consciousness building
At the request of the emperor
We've ventured from the center of the thought
So we can package it and market it to be bought

[Verse 3: Eyedea]
Alcohol is proven to paralyze the mind
And what do you see advertised on almost every billboard sign?
But wine ain't always the answer, so once upon a time
They flooded the streets with heroine
To stop the rise of the Black Panthers
They keep us doped up and psychologically clamped
The projects is just a concentration camp
Don't say we can't kill the system
Now it's time to shoot
I'll turn my head inside out if I have to
To find the truth

[Refrain: Eyedea]
Land of the free
And home of the Brave New World Order
Pour some more fluoride in your water
Land of the free
As long as your freedom don't encourage freedom
And stifle the governments freedom to minimalize your freedom

[Refrain: Eyedea]
The leader of the drug cultures
The leader of the country
The root of all evils buried deep within the money
Back when I was asleep I didn't know that dream were fake
But you can't kill me, when I'm awake

[Refrain: Slug]
Welcome!
To the new arena! Nice to meet ya!
Rule number 1 is:
If you got something to say, you better shut up!
Seldom
Will you even see the way we treat ya
Have a choke and a smile and pick your nuts up
