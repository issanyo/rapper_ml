[Hook]
(On a clear day) I can see for miles
(On a clear day) I can be myself
(On a clear day) I can sit in my place
(On a clear day) I'm not part of this race
(On a clear day) I'm not in this alone
(On a clear day) I got freedom to roam
(On a clear day) I can sit in my place
(On a clear day) I withdraw from the race

[Verse 1]
Excuse me, but there's so much here for you to touch
And there's nothing I can do to make you give a fuck
Sometimes everything ain't enough
When the eyes retire from wearing desire's handcuffs
If I was content sitting I wouldn't need to stand up
Why am I living if I can't love?
I want to scream at the top of my bleeding lungs
Never meant to break your trust
Just wanted to wake you up
Once before I left in this personal search for clarity
Either they're scared of me or laughing hysterically
I'm just a parody of something that apparently
Was never properly prepared to bleed
Oh how do I wish that I'd never learned to cry
When your only reply is waving your hands from side-to-side
I am lost cause I'm my own tour guide
And if I ever talk to myself I'll probably tell lies
So for now I sit in this disfigured toadstool
Showing the face of a child that only smiles cause he's told to
Sometimes they look to me for the answers and I don't know what to do
I'm usually just as confused as you

[Hook]
(On a clear day) I can see for miles
(On a clear day) I can be myself
(On a clear day) I can sit in place
(On a clear day) I'm not part of this race
(On a clear day) I'm not in this alone
(On a clear day) I got freedom to roam
(On a clear day) I can sit in my place
(On a clear day) I withdraw from the race

[Verse 2]
The chord sprung a leak
The mind was filled with cork crumbs
Charisma bit its cheek and died of boredom
It's not a clear day until the war is done
And I'm no longer haunted by the bullet hole
I put in the head of a porcelain clown found porch bum
Reciting my spells biting the nail off my sore thumb
Leaving for good I knew that when the door swung
I don't believe that I could stay even if I wanted to
My brain ain't gray sky or water proof
So by tomorrow I'll be a robot again
The thought of the clouds coming in makes me cringe
But I've been in the storm, submerged in the distortion
For most of my days spent following this course and
I'm learning to love the moment that's rolling
Instead of openly viewing time as my opponent
So I'm always...

Wait, wait, wait, wait!
Here let me cut this shit man
It's a nice day
Fuck sitting here and writing
I'm going for a walk...
