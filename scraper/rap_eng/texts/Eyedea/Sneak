[Verse 1]
Never was one to wonder, 'bout her being under covers with somebody other than me but something seems up
Her little inner sinner suddenly gets freed up
She needs love, obviously I don't have enough
Must have been the trust cause the fucking was always great
Or maybe she was a slut and I was last to see the tape
Feel played, feel broken, feel hate, feel stolen
Ice where my heart used to be, now I'm frozen
Yeah, just another bad love song
But come on you was numb way long before the fat lady ever did sung
Violin strums, pain feels violent, eyelids stung from the tears
And who's going pay me back for all the years
And every lady I wanna' love after this I'm gunna' fear
Cause it burns baby burns baby burns till it sears

[Hook]
Hush little baby don't say a word
No, don't you make a peep
Cause there's a little rumor going 'round the town
This girl is such a sneak

She's a freak in the sheets, but discrete in the streets
Which is why it wouldn't seem she's the type to creep
Woe is me, oh now I see
This girl is such a sneak

[Verse 2]
So I've been seeing this gal who's been seeing guy
She says he's just her pal but I think it's a lie
Cause when I bring up dating her she doesn't even try
To hold me to commitment to tangle relation ties[?]
Oh why why will I question this
I get to touch her tits and when I bust I split
But it's the rush I get knowing lust is sick
And if I fuck a bitch she do it just as quick
And I'm mad
I can't go on just pretending that this "just a friend" thing won't rush an ending
I'm a lust descending into bad luck, dummy
Wanna' trade my hunny for a damn fuck buddy
Relationships suck when you want one
Trust isn't something you pack up and run from
You gotta' feel it in your guts that she's really not a slut
Who conceals all the eels that she's feeling in her guts (Yuck!)
This definitely isn't what I want
Karma from when she let me stick it in her butt
Now I toss and I turn cause I'm lost and concerned
Cause my cock when I pee
Well it burns baby burns baby burns

[Hook]
Hush little baby don't say a word
No, don't you make a peep
Cause there's a little rumor going 'round the town
This girl is such a sneak

She's a freak in the sheets, but discrete in the streets
Which is why it wouldn't seem she's the type to creep
Woe is me, oh now I see
This girl is such a sneak

[Verse 3: Eyedea]
I watch the moonlight reflect off the eyelashes
Love the way you pick the terrible and make it more tragic
Scratchy skin won't cover the aroma
Pull off the sheets clothes, find an old lover turned loner
Cold shoulders, still hot headed
Bright blue eyes and a nasty little coke habit
You can coin toss, pillow talk, call heads or tails
Doesn't matter either way you're still sleeping on a bed of nails
Storms coming, but it won't stop me from setting sail
Sun would be ideal, but I'd rather have rain than hail
Another shot helps me stop thinking about her
At worst it's a futile mess, at best it's still going nowhere
The closer I get the further it appears to me
I'm your pet, you're my personal sneak
Birds of the same feather flock together, eat, fuck and hurt
You're not the only one that's been burned baby burned baby burned

[Hook]
Hush little baby don't say a word
No, don't you make a peep
Cause there's a little rumor going 'round the town
This girl is such a sneak

She's a freak in the sheets, but discrete in the streets
Which is why it wouldn't seem she's the type to creep
Woe is me, oh now I see
This girl is such a sneak
