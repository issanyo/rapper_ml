I'm gonna run from the voice of reason 'till it turns to laughter
Against the masquerade like I don't believe in the morning after
The chronicles contain a few hidden chapters
A Wrinkle in time so there is no dream to chase after
I keep my mirrors dirty, in case vanity backfires but does it matter
Or even apply to me with my left field rap career happened without celebration making me featureless
Nobody even knows what I can do with a microphone and with eight stories is it meaningless
A cold grin curtains hunger pains and eagerness
In one throw you could expose up my weaknesses
I'm putty in your hands keep my wicked ways buried'in sand
Until you learn to look through a window no one else can

Oh charity, clarity, honesty excitement
The one with class, falsely accused, misconstrued
Anger, sorrow, happy, machinery, decisions, collision
Instant gratification, not thinking logically
Programmed to destruct obviously
A Wrinkle in time, probably

What don't kill me, will just me crazier
The smoke gets hazier, The rhymes get lazier
Hard to claim myself as a mic fiend blazier but i ain't no savior
I'm so filthy, sorry you had to see me like this
Can't steal my ideas because nobody wants to bite this
Each track is a fight
I sold you a lie that showed through my eyes
It told you to cry a stained glass suicide
They slowly chiseled down the walls we all hide behind
It's only time before your secrets become weakened headlines
But I'll be fine, suffocating on my own anonymous mask
I just wish I could forget how to read ambiance between the cracks

Perceptive, unethical, digested tunnel vision, decisons
Methadone, real diamond cut tested, i'm guessing
Resurrected perfected by well respected professionals
Head doctor, head hunter, scratched the surface
Lost somewhere, accepted own ability transparent open curves
It hurts, It burns
A wrinkle in time yet the world still turns

[Repeat 2X]
You're living in a world made of windows and mirrors
Using safeguards covered crystallized tears
In and out different images, same fear
One day it's all gonna shatter, and I hope you're right here...

See through my anxieties and insecurities rip out my insides
Put 'em on display, encaged, enraged, hands on the wheel throttle
Vocab Vulture matching words to boggle
No games but I still button mash and toggle and break the bottle
That I've become, I run I jump I grow completely shattered fractured, captured
Glad I had the chance to be so helpless
See through my four corner window pane
Plain and simple
My Brain is crippled running through a maze
When did I decide to be an object of reflection, crucified for all my imperfections
I answered every question peeling the tint off of my confession
Close your eyes if we can
Death to pride, lets begin
I'm wrinkled and everything's a dream
And I don't miss a damn thing
Broken mirrors don’t bring bad love, they
Cherish image, how do I look any given day
You can't kill me if you rebuild me
You won't she won't he won't
I gotta do it all alone again goodbye
You fled - no one ever said - there was any peace came out of my head
I’m dead, everybody lies and plays in time before they’re born again
Wipe my slate clean, I wanna skate upon your pretty reddish skin and holler matrimony, mope she broke. And now we know enough about each other everything is shattered!
Everything is shattered
Everything is shattered
But does it really matter
A wrinkle in time is all that ever happened
