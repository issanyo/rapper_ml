Rain
Everyone wants to get out of the rain
Wants to be free, wants to see no more pain
We're guaranteed that the seasons will change
'Till then, I'm keeping sunshine on my brain
When the drops hit my head they leave a stain
Everyone wants to get out of the rain
Everyone wants to get out of the rain
Everyone wants to get out of the rain

Harvested love only comes after rain
Even though it brings overwhelming strain
It falls from all skies so I can't complain
Without it, our growth would not be the same
Most people like to have someone to blame
But it falls randomly, not taking aim
It makes up one half of the yin and yang

Harvested skill only comes after rain
Architects build under sun, so they claim
But when the puddles decided to hang
Is when their hands sketched the plans that remained
Every man secretly hopes he can tame
The beast he fears most cause it can't be slain
Towering, gray faces laugh so deranged
One day we all will break free from their chains
One day we all will break free from their chains
And rise towards the sun with good health sustained
It's almost impossible to explain
But I owe all my success to the
