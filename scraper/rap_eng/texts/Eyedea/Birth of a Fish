He lives in a four by two glass box that reminds me of my head
I wish my floor would have rocks, but it's covered with puddles instead
If I could be him, life would be great
I could erase this permanent frown
I wouldn't even be held down by my own weight
I woke up walked to the tank to hear his thoughts on yesterday
"How was it?" I asked And after a tap on the glass
He looked my way then gave me this depressed expression
And pressed his best just to say;
"Besides the tides and the grey skies, it was ok!"
And I said< "Hey mister fish, you did all that you wish
You got nothing to complain about while hanging out in this abyss"
And he replied "Well existence is bliss, there's so much that you missed
Besides get off the trip, happiness is just a myth"
I said "Living in water is extremely more peaceful than life confined to a mind
Blinded by evil, and forced to see through these two peep holes
It seems I've redeemed freedom, not being limited by walls
But that only means I qualify as ground for the sky when it falls
That only means I qualify as ground for the sky when it falls
That only means I qualify as ground for the sky when it falls
That only means I qualify as ground for the sky when it falls'
But Mr. Fish just laughed as I went on and on and on
So I interrupted his chuckle, putting up a middle finger
And he boldly told me it's too bad I'm such a thinker
So Arrogantly I asked "How could someone think too much?"
He added that insanity lingers and thoughts brought me to the brink of such
He said "You live inside a head that reminds me of my glass box
And everyone's the same; all brains are contained by your reality frame
And chained to the terrain, it's trained not to change
And once you see what I've explained you hit the jackpot"
And at that very moment it was like my eyes really opened
The air that previously surrounded me was now an ocean
Still totally invisible except for minor pieces of debris
Then Mr. Fish pushed up to the glass and he looked just like me
My whole world spun around, I didn't understand
But I realized I was no longer a man
So I thought about what he said and asked him what was going on
And he said, "You didn't know it but you were the fish all along"
He said, "Congratulations, you did it, you broke free
You're just a fish, like the rest of humanity"
Now it took me a long time to get adjusted to this tank
But now I know what I am, and so to that man I give thanks
I've always lived inside this glass box that reminds him of his head
It just goes to show ya that your mind is your own monster
Reality is what you make it, and if you take it away
You're just a fish, like me, swimming in the powdered water
