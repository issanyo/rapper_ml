Head heavy
Left on the shoulders
Dead dead dead dead dead me till I'm over
I let my breath bleed all over your colder
Shoulder that you try to flip over
I know words might seem the same
But I can see a light beam that's pink in my brain
I called it this living information in my frame
But theirs nothing left that I have to paint
Can you guys give me one second
Cause I wanna try to catch it
And I wanna make sure that when its dissected
I wreck it
I give it a second
Fuck it I give it a minute
Because time and space don't mean shit if the earth ain't spinning
Cause that's how we define the lines that we set
Between the stars and the universe's design
It hurts but I'm fine
Because this is the type of person I am
I'm built to climb any mountain and any galaxy
And anything that lives inside of me, inside of me
And here it goes
The hero knows that he can't save the break brave
So he grows up to be another dead human being
Walking around like a zombie
Not even achieving anything and his dreams bleed right into his brain
They go into his life while hes awake
And I don't know what to do about him
Can't give him advice
Cause I don't really have shit to tell anybody about life
Cause if they looked at me and followed my device
They'd be stuck in my same crisis
Grasping on the light
And there's nothing but darkness inside of the heart compartments
And so the second you started
My heart skips a couple beats
I don't know how to breathe
I know what you can achieve
I know when you wanna leave
I can read it in your eyes
No tricks up the sleeve
I can beat it till it dies
And finally lives in me
Live inside of me until the day that you die
Because I know that when you touch the sky, you don't get too high
Your mine and your this design
That's inside your genetic code I can't let it go
Cause I'm still possessed by the flesh
That I just got stuck inside of
Inside of my best parts of my head
And my heart and my death
And the start of this little spark
That left me undressed
And I don't know how to contest
Because there's a part of me that thinks your the worst
And best part of me thinks your the best
And yes is a no
Its the same answer
Its the pain
Its climbing the cancer in your brain
I try to advance
I try to dance with you to this flame
But the candles not lit enough
So I explain why the light is not holding up to the sun
Why I'm alright even though I'm overdone
Why I feel like I'm alive even though I'm numb
Why I feel like I'm gonna die
Even though I'm someone that is meant to be alive
For as long as I can finally be living inside of a song
Or living inside a breath
Or living inside a death
I still try to write it till the destiny is dept
And there's no part that can be part of the whole
And there's no excuse for getting loose from the noose you hold
The truth was told back in the days
And I can still feel it
It's real to me so I say everything I can
I still wanna be your friend
Even though I wanna crawl it up my skin
I wanna just dig back into the fetus
In the fetal position
I wanna cut off my ears and find a way to finally listen
I wanna try to ride it in this new position
I wanna provide my light, my mind with new decisions
I wanna stop living in the shit that I live in
I wanna stop taking from you while still giving
I wanna get rid of this old religion
I wanna just break it then gap the bridge
And move on til I can live for my children
That I still don't have
Living for building
Living for building
Living for building
Living for building
Living for building
Living for building
I'm living for building and if I'm not alive
I probably was killed then
