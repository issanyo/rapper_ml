[Verse 1]
Now he sleeps with pillow in between his legs
Hoping that his dreams don't haunt him tonight
But they keep on coming back every day after day
He wonders if he'll have them for the rest of his life
Now he quit smoking cigarettes three years ago
Just didn't like the thought of being dead by fifty-three
He don't miss the head rush from the pack of Marlboros
He's just thankful that he was able to break free
He loves to sit under the sun and write his songs
Breaking his addiction proved to him he wasn't weak
But he does still smoke in fact he did all along
The difference is now he only does it in his sleep
And he tries to wake himself when he lights the match
But he has to inhale, he has no control
So he cries, cause he thought he escaped the trap
But it's a reoccurring nightmare and he wants to know

[Hook]
What is a dream (Something to sleep on)
What is a dream (Something he needs gone)
What is a dream (Something that keeps on)
What is a dream (Just a problem with his head)

What is a dream (Something that speaks strong)
What is a dream (Something that we want)
What is a dream (Something he'll sleep on)
What is a dream (He doesn't want to go to bed)

[Verse 2]
Now he met this young girl around the same time
He dropped his smoking habit and began it in the dreams
He let her in his life because he needed to shine
And she was the most beautiful woman he had ever seen
And he grew three years long, two hearts wide
And immeasurably deep, they were perfect together
And he knew somehow, he felt on the inside
That no matter what the weather it'd be him and her forever
Their hands interlocked 'till the end of routine
He would never break her heart because the love is so real
And he can't seem to stop having these dreams
Where he solemnly commits adultery against his will
And he tries to wake himself because he loves his girl
But he has to take it all, he has no control
So he cries 'till he's out of his subconscious world
It's a reoccurring nightmare and he wants to know

[Hook]
What is a dream (Something to sleep on)
What is a dream (Something he needs gone)
What is a dream (Something that keeps on)
What is a dream (Just a problem with his head)

What is a dream (Something that speaks strong)
What is a dream (Something that we want)
What is a dream (Something he'll sleep on)
What is a dream (He doesn't want to go to bed)

[Verse 3]
Now he bought a couple books to help him understand
What was going on on the inside of his brain
He thought if it persisted he may lose his stance
And was told that was step one to going insane
Every night it's the same, either one of the two
Lighting up a cigarette or cheating on his woman
And he fights constantly in his head what to do
Cause what he does in his dreams, in real life he wouldn't
No control, makes him skeptic of everything else
He don't trust himself cause dreams can come true
His soul is agitated from its image itself
And he wants to be happy but don't know what he's gotta do
So he walked one day, through the woods for miles
With the waterfall below he stood at the edge of a cliff
When he talked, he heard an echo so he exhaled his Marlboro, grabbed his dick and screamed

Dreams are bullshit
Dreams are bullshit
Dreams are bullshit
Dreams are bullshit
Dreams are bullshit

[Outro]
What is a dream
Dreams are bullshit (x10)
