Thank you

Man, save the kids from the ignorance

[Verse 1 : Eyedea]
We save them from the ignorance - we save them from the indolence and from the innocence and from the penetrating benefits
And from all of the skeptic mystisism and all of the neglected wisdom and the eclectic visions
That wreck incisions - the prosphetic limbs bend into the wrong space -
Why don’t you transcend - let the wind hit skin and then -
Only then will you be able to eat, will you be able to feel your fucking teeth when the flavourless meat’s ripped

[Verse 2 : Kristoff Krane]
I can't feel my feet
I can’t feel my balance
I can’t fill my void
I can’t build this palace
My teeth are so weak
They grind to eachover
My peoples are blind
My brothers and mothers
(Stomach rumbling.)

[Eyedea]
I hold it, I controlled it
I first revoked it
But now that I’ve got a little bit older I know that it’s too hot to hold -
So I have to hope it, one day will cool down -
Wipe it with soap and scope without from a mile away out of town

[Verse 3 : Mazta I]
And then I took the chance and grabbed it anyway without the pot
Hold us - yes now, that I’m holding’s gold
Fist don’t, know, where my skin is going to grow back -
All I see is motherfucking bones - what?
Who is gong to control that?

[Kristoff Krane]
Sticks, sticks, sticks and stones
They won't ever break my bones
They won't ever hang me from my own eternal mistletoe
They won't ever put me on the little individual’s kind of a little invisible -
When you’re swimming in a little tiny, principle they can’t even see anymore it’s pain

[Eyedea]
Thank you
I do this, I can’t see, but
I’m so sorry

[Kristoff Krane]
So unproportionate
Constant buzzing
Always going on; is never silent
