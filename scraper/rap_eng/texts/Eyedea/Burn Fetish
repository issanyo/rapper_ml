[Verse 1: Eyedea]
Teeth marks on the skin
The greatest trick the devil ever played was convincing me that I was him
We like to feel the blood and fat dripping off our gums
She likes to talk directly down the barrel of her gun
Learning to perfect the ancient art of quiet rape
You've always been so warm and calculated, I owe you a thanks
Eyes wide shut, I promise not to fall awake
Lick the guillotine and tell you how the gasoline tastes
The grass is always greener on the other pesticide
Solemn precious crept through the mess to shed it's infectious high
What's for me to know and you to find
Guilty, the almighty praised adrenaline
Such an underwhelming thrill
Where there's a will there's a wake
Burn me at the stake
Who the hell am I trying to fool?
I'm a fool, I feel so fake
One last goodbye before I take my .45
Shoot a hole in the sky, rip it open
And climb inside

[Hook: Eyedea]
Empathy is the poor man's cocaine
And love is just a chemical by any other name
I like the way your pheromones make me sleepy
This far away I still smell you inside me
Empathy is the poor man's cocaine
And love is just a chemical by any other name
I like the way your pheromones make me sleepy
This far away I still smell you inside me

[Bridge]
Tie me down till my sweet nothing's sour
I screwed up trying to squeeze 65 minutes from an hour
Outnumbered by such a large amount
No wonder why we lost the battle, the counter-culture can't count

[Verse 2: Eyedea]
Welcome to my private hell
There's no one to fight now, enjoy myself
I'd rather drown than ask for help
I wish I was someone else
Mr. Perfect, Misconstrued
Lead the way, follow through
You probably hate me, I do too
You're so much like me I feel sorry for you
But I think you're pretty, pretty sure
You will profit, you will get hurt
I eat my words they taste like dirt
I'm only ashamed because I know what it's worth
Find my comfort inside blame
Shove my pride back down my face
My worst habit's waking up at least once a day
Balance barefoot on a needle heaven's just a jump away

[Hook]
Empathy is the poor man's cocaine
And love is just a chemical by any other name
I like the way your pheromones make me sleepy
This far away I still smell you inside me
Empathy is the poor man's cocaine
And love is just a chemical by any other name
I like the way your pheromones make me sleepy
This far away I still smell you inside me
