[Verse 1]
Trying to fix the leak
Ruined your precious chic
No one’s as dead as the brave
Piety’s bad on brains
It’s training via neglect
I get the flu you get our friends
So worst best thing
I don’t think it’s…

[Chorus 1]
Broke part of the castle for the lullaby me all the way to coma
I don’t care
Glad to finally get some clarity and break my teeth in calm restraint -
I’m morning sick I had to do good I’m hurting for someone to bore me -
Over ‘til the mosh grew up, a sentence before I dropped
"Leave me the fuck alone," it's a good goodbye
Dopamine, vaccine, poisoned apple of my eye
Knife through the stars, sit, drink away while the night bleeds
Monumental discouragement so inspiring, hey

[Verse 2]
Trying to fix the leak
I ruined your precious chic
Breaking this feared event
I don’t think it’s…

[Chorus 2]
Broke part of the castle for the lullaby me all the way to coma
I don’t care
Glad to finally get some clarity and break my teeth in calm restraint -
I’m morning sick I had to do good I’m hurting for someone to bore me -
Over ‘til the mosh grew up, a sentence before I drop
"Leave me the fuck alone", it's a good goodbye
Dopamine, vaccine, poisoned apple of my eye, knife through the stars sit, drink away while the night bleeds -
Monumental discouragement so inspiring, hey
