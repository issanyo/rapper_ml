This year Halloween fell on a weekend

[??]
Day by day it's more impossible to cope

[Eyedea]
I make big money. I drive big cars
That’s the rigs
I don’t behave or big dream anymore
Before the cordial fuck you
Who do you think you are
You think too hard
You are not sane
The fact that your wack speech puts you in direct breach of our agreement
When intellect peaks and starts its down hill journey beware the next scene
That everywhere the bleeding consists of multiple close up shots wherein my fist gratefully introduces your teeth to the cement
Contract is signed and you’ll be fine to be resigned to nonviolence
But I didn’t know that you was going to be rhyming
So now it is time to set the lawyers aside and start destroying your pride I’m annoyed with your vibe the tone in your voice when you cry reminds me of every other motherfucker I’ve crossed and talked too much
Got crushed, lost his life
Was tossed right off the mic
Is in my nauseous nights
The moral of the story is stick to your word and you won’t be served

[Crescent Moon]
At night I can't sleep, I toss and turn
Still got a lot to learn
Before i hop the cuve
