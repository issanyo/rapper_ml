I've never been here
But I think that I should leave now
I think that I should leave now, for better or worse

Make me a rainbow
Tell me that its real
Here lies the hero
Get me out of here

Here lies the window
The window that you know
A fog that I would kill for
I'll take it as it comes

Take me as I hide myself
You'd be crazy if you didn't
As expected, Im offensive
See me through there is no difference

After its all said and done, tell me what I want to hear
I wanna hear
I want it now
I won't let go
I can't get it out

I've never been here, so I think that I should leave now, I think that I should leave now, for better or worse
