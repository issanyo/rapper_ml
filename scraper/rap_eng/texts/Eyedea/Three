[Kristoff Krane]
Skippity loo da, skippity day
My oh my what a wonderful way

Skippity doo da, skippity day
My oh my what a wonderful plague
Skippity doo da, skippity day
Everyone's dying, 'round the way
Skippity doo da, skippity day
My oh my what a wonderful plague
Skippity doo da, skippity day
Everyone's dying, and no one will live

[Eyedea]
Well if I had a chance to give the cure to
What we endure I would make it, pure
In this biological state
I would throw it to your fate
I would make sure that you escape
This degenerate

[Kristoff]
But would it work the same for anyone that digested it and
Put it in the body that they call a sittin' stem
Or would it sometimes lead to different side-effects
And would invigorate the primate parts of me that I dissect

[Eyedea]
Well there'd be no side-effects
Because what I invent
Would be so perfect
It would be perfect
For every person

[Kristoff]
Perfectly aligned, perfectly aligned
That's fine that's fine that's fine
We're all living in a box and we're all just minds
And put our hands in a light
But sometimes the light and everything in between
Makes me silent so I think that I'm a cat
But really, inside, are the courage of a lion

[Eyedea]
Would it work for me, if it, will work for you
I spit a little work for me, if it don't work for you
It'll work for me it'll work for me
It'll personally be my best if it works for you or your friends
It'll work for me, it'll get inside of my head circuitry
It'll work for me if it works for you

[Kristoff]
Sure I believe you
But do I need a bag
For everything that you say
Will make everything just go away
And I'm okay
Some days
When you give it to me
But I do not believe that it will do
The same thing for me as it does for you

[Eyedea]
My medicine, is my favorite point
My medicine is a metaphor for your
Disappointment
My medicine is yours
My medicine is open indoors
Close in walls
And it all inside of my pores

[?] us all, and get 'em, inside of it
Gettin' close enough to touch it
And then I hide from it
I light it, I fall asleep in it
And I give it up, but I wind up givin' it back
I want 'em takin' it
I don't want 'em keeping it 'cause [?]

[Kristoff]
And when you give it up you will drop it
On the sidewalk of 7th and 3rd and I will
Pick it up one day when I'm staring at a bird
Because I've been feeling disturbed
I'mma need something else, to have an influence
On my reality so give me that I will make
Harmonious with everything like

[Kristoff (Eyedea)]
(I love you, so much) I love you as well
(My medicine)
My medi- (I love you so much)
My medicine, my medicine (My medicine)

[Both]
I love you so much, my medicine

[Kristoff (Eyedea)]
(I love you) Skippity doo da
(Let's let it in) Skippity day
