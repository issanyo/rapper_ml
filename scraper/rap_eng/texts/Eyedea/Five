[Eyedea and Kristoff Krane, repeated]
I'm gettin' ugly

[Eyedea]
I'm gettin' ugly but it couldn't
Touch me, it couldn't even come close
It couldn't touch me
It couldn't, it couldn't even come close
It couldn't touch me
It couldn't, no it couldn't even come close
It couldn't touch me couldn't touch me couldn't touch me
I'm gettin' ugly, it couldn't touch me
No it couldn't even come close

Now every thorn has its rose
But I was born, to oppose
The way we traveled down this road
Living in [?] inside of the ice
Inside of the snow inside of your mind
Inside of your spine inside of the time
That goes [?] fast and if you could catch it for
A sec, you might change your respect
Or change your direction
What are you supposed to protect
Your little cells that are all dividing
Well what are you providing
I know that you are
Wow you were tellin' the truth?
But you were, lying
I'm trying to dive into it
For one second
Skin it
And see what's in it
For one minute or two
Or five or six
Or seven or eight or nine or ten or
Eleven or twelve or thirteen
Doesn't matter it's all a trick that's
Made by magic, rabbits out of a hat
I'm a disappearing act
Now how clear is that?
