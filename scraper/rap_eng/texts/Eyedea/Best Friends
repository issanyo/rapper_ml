I think this one looks like a fight, between a plate of fruit and my dads exercise bike
I bet if these ants dancing next to my head could fly that high
They would use that cloud as a bed

[Kristoff Krane]
But my dad said that bugs bite and fly with the wind
And if the sun isn't hung right then run like a fish
We could win if we both try to untie our fins
And climb that pine tree with the swing on it behind the fence

[Eyedea]
Alright, one, two, three, let's race, I bet that I can beat you there
Last time you ran faster than a grown up when we were here
Remember? I scraped my knee then got stung by a bumblebee
And the old man that lives behind the fence came out and yelled at me

[Kristoff Krane]
Of course I remember, Oh how could I forget?
He wrote my mom a letter and my daddy threw a fit
But this time will be better I promise as long as we're honest he'll give us permission
[Eyedea] Yeah he can't say no to a kid

[Hook: Kristoff Krane & Eyedea]
I will never turn my back to a lollipop to lick
It's all puppy dog kisses and hugs
So fill my cup with cotton candy, ice-cream and weekend sleepovers
I don't wanna grow up if it means getting older

I will never turn my back to a lollipop to lick
It's all puppy dog kisses and hugs
So fill my cup with cotton candy, ice-cream and weekend sleepovers
No, I don't really wanna grow up if it means getting older

[Kristoff Krane]
See, what I really don't get is why the big kids never get grounded after playing ding dong ditch
And the slingshots look like mighty fun, wish that I had one
That way I could stand up to bullies, instead of trying to run

[Eyedea]
Yeah, and they always get the baseball cards from the policemen
Being tall don't make you smart
At least we can always find something to do
Like looking at the clouds with my best friend, That's you

[Kristoff Krane]
I'm not sure what to say, I'm just happy that we're small enough to look up at the sky and feel okay
And I'd be lying if I tried to say that I don't feel the same way as you do
So let's be on our way it's time to play

[Eyedea]
Oh, to the jungle gym or to the swimming pool
School's out forever
And I hope I'm never too cool to keep on making my life better
Whether 5, 25 or 80 as long as I'm alive I'm in love and forever changing

[Hook *Variation*]
I will never turn my back to a lollipop to lick
It's kisses and a hug with love
Fill my cup with a bunch of good things that always feel alright
Cause I'm a little kid, we're all little kids on the inside

Never turn my back on a cupcake
Love mixed with kisses and a kitten with love
Now fill my cup full of cotton candy, ice-cream and weekend sleep-overs
I will never grow up, cause I'll never get older
