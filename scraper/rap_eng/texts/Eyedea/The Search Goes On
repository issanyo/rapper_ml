[Intro] X 2
These songs ain't me
They're just the way I feel at a particular moment
And at this particular moment, the search goes on

[Verse 1]
Sometimes I swear if it wasn't for the mic
I wouldn't get dressed and go through this piss-test
We all call "life"
Without being about to fall right on my face
So I never run in place
And always try to cover up my mistakes
Cause running takes energy
And going nowhere's a waste
And if you mess up, all of a sudden
You're subject to hate, well, great
There's no escape
We all get ten seconds to get our point across
And then we're supposed to shut up
(man, wait wait wait wait wait wait)
People in a rush to get nowhere
They hurry up to get past that; once they're there
They're in a hurry to leave to find a place to relax at
They hurry up and relax, cause they had other plans
Seeds in a hurry to be a plant
I'm a boy in a hurry to be a man
But I can't
Damn, I just wanna display these skills
And not have to worry about a square
Three meals or paying bills
Just the thought sends chills down my spine
Hell yeah I rhyme
But I need to find something to do for real
Word to G Pu that's a ten year vet
Who invested mad talent and still ain't seen a paycheck
He's asking what's next?
I'm up to my neck in compliments
So I'm pretty deep up in it
And I'm already at the point
Where only music keeps me grinning
And look, I'm still sitting and trying to write rhymes
I'm an emcee
Even if that's all I ever am in my whole lifetime
(why you still trying...)
Yeah, I'm an emcee
Even if that's all I ever am in my whole lifetime

[Chorus]
Where am I going? I'm not really sure
I think it's in a good direction but it's all a blur
All's I can do is show love, put in effort, and try
And maybe I'll accomplish finding myself before I die

Where are you going? Are you sure?
In order to know who you are you gotta know who you were
In order to know who you'll be
In order to be free, I don't know about you
But the search goes on for me

[Verse 2]
I can win battles, make albums, write books
Raise a kid, go to college all or none of the above
Spend every night in the club; waste my life on drugs
Try to change the corrupt world or
Meet a girl and fall in love; write a screenplay
Design freeways, be a high-school teacher
(be the voice trying to reach the one furthest from the speaker)
Live in the country or the city; have a dog or a kitty
Sleep til noon eat some shrooms and bathe in self-pity
If you choose the emcee route
It might take you til you're dead
Before half the people that heard you
Understand what you said
I'll take a breath, before I throw this statement out:
I don't complain I just give you something to complain about

Emcees should know their limitations
I'm patiently waiting to reach, my destination
Through this current occupation of speech
But me, I listen to what I'm told
After so much work and so much time, shit gets old
My goal is not to be the illest with the flow
But if I am, it's cause I'm persistent and it shows
You got your definition of accomplishments
I got my own; mine ain't got to do with dough
Just finding my soul
Word to Michael Jordan, Bruce Lee
Tiger Woods and Bill Gates
I'ma keep carrying my man's greats
Until I can conversate with fate
And ask if it's a waste holding a mic, shit
At any rate, I hope you like it

[Chorus]
Where am I going? I'm not really sure
I think it's in a good direction but it's all a blur
All's I can do is show love put in effort and try
And maybe I'll accomplish finding myself before I die

Where are you going? Are you sure?
In order to know who you are you gotta know who you were
In order to know who you'll be
In order to be free, yo, I don't know about you
But the search goes on for me
The search goes on for me
