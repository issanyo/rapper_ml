(One, two, three, four)

I caught a half a smile
Tryin' to sneak onto your face
It's not what you think
It's everyone else's fault
I'm perfectly sane

Go away
I lose my pulse
Just to gain control
Feel so fake
You are my god
You're my poison and paralyzed savior

I taste your blood
You're so fucked up
And you pay her
Drag or chase her
I don't blame her
We're not from the same earth

I'm called a bastard child
An envious beef with no guts and no taste
It's not what you think
It's everyone else's fault
The ride has been plain

Go away
I lose my pulse
Just to gain control
It's all in good faith
You are my god
You're my poison and paralyzed savior

I taste your blood
You're so fucked up
And they pay her
Drag or chase her
I don't blame her
We're not from the same earth

I sing down
You love me back
The son of Sam
Blood on your hands and
You are

I sing down
You love me back
The son of Sam
With blood on my hands and
You oughta

Tear me down
Yeah fuck you back
If you won't take no laugh
I set down my path
Just to haunt you
