[Intro]

We are now planning for sex on the streets in every major city from coast to coast
And get ready for a shock; the music, that they're planning to use, to crumble the walls of America, is this rotten, filthy, dirty, lude, lascivious, junk!
Called rock and roll


[Verse 1]

You stand here
I'll stand there
This is sex from a cemetery
Don't be scared
No-one's there
She's just talking and I'm honestly...


[Reversed]:

(You stand here
I'll stand there
This is sex...)


[Chorus]:

I don't care!
I don't care!
Oh yeah - itch me!


[Verse 2]

Pull my hair
Push up air
There's nothing left for you to breath
Say my prayers
It's only fair
It's not special if it's not weak


[Chorus]:

I don't care!
I don't care!
Oh yeah - itch me!


[Reversed]:

(Pull my hair
Push up air
There's nothing left for you...)


[Verse 3]:

You stand here
I'll stand near
This is sex or symmetry
Don't be scared
No-one's there
She's just talking and I'm honestly...


[Chorus]:

Now we're clear!
Now we're clear!
Oh yeah - itch me!
