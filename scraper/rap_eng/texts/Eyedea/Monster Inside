[Verse 1: Eyedea]
Yo, there's a Monster Inside Me
And I hide because form any tiny disruption
I find the destruction of all emcees, fall and freeze
With ya hands behind ya back
Ya man will find ya fractured
I attack first and leave last
So I'm walkin away laughin', stay passive
I tell my self but aggressions' my weapon of choice
Can you feel me, fuck if you can feel me or not
Cause really its not for you
Iâ€™m filling the potholes of hip-hop with skills
Head for the hills
If ya wanna keep that head for real
Cause I intend to kill
I belch more flavor than any will
With four more years of experience
Heres a tip, quit rhyming quick, ya shits got me inferiors
Seriously monstrous is how I actin
Plow and wackin' down to fractions
Bouncing back in different form
With abnormal reactions you were born
Don't be rappin', fasten ya seat belt and chill
And feel the heat melt ya grill
The monsters comin' out to kill
I feel im stealin' my brains position, itchin'
For this win its in my blood to kill
Whats even stranger is that this anger
Is wrapped up with a bunch of skill
It doesn't feel right to let a fake emcee
Walk away from me not bleeding
Even is I liked him as a person, I have to hurt him just for teasin'
Me and my lyrics are tight
Like bark to a tree and snow in the winter season
Were alone at night I start to emcee even when im sleepin'
Eatin' you is healthy
Cause you're not fat got that, in fact
You're quite nutritious I might do dishes with your watery ass
You got to be fast to escape my grasp
But what makes me laugh is your fake ass tracks
Im brakin backs with bats over anything
My voice is echoing like
This was the Grand Canyon but this man standin' in front of you
Beat... As the monster comes to fuck up your crew

[Verse 2: Eyedea]
I have illogical deep dark dreams
Where I follow you to the sweet park scene
And see me starting to perform a new pain infliction act
That maybe its an accident
My conscious tells me but its a full moon, so soon
I will return to my restin place
Im feeling wrestless weight
I wipe my sweaty face
It was just a dream, but manifest
Into my flows a monster grows
I gotta go get a cup of tea and relax
As I realize no one can fuck with me and my raps
Ya trapped, im in a realm of wackness
And they comin' back
With flashes of acid trips
I have to rip your tongue out
Come out and get it back you bitch
You be rhymin' in a puddle of your own blood after this, Ha
Suddenly your mumbling
Funny thing I thought you would just stop
Cause my lyrics are monsterfying
Sorry to leave ya momma crying
But I need to eat you
Its a urge from within
No I don't really chew on you
Its worth the words im kickin'
So within my own analysis
My style is crisp
So listen for a flaw
Im gettin' callouses from grippin this mic so hard
You're like, oh god please come to my rescue
But he told me to test you
For messin with hip hop
You get dropped
The rhymin' cops come and arrest you
When its time to stop
I don't expect you to keep flowin
I'll call the next crew
Cause you got me dozin'
You're weak slow and ya keep posin', to be an MC
I'll leave ya beat broke and ya beats roast
From these hot lyrics
Ya like cheap clothes and daytons
You don't belong here, kid
Im stronger with my shit than lumber jaxes, with axes
Ya stomach acid is active
Cause my attack is massive
Fighting back with magical lyrical tactics
Deteriorating, and infer failing MC's, when I get hot
Im nearly 280 degrees, Ya making me sneeze
My allergies are highly sensitive to no achievement
It's impossible to stop the monsters force of believing
I'll make ya eat shit and wash it down with coffee grounds
You crossed the bounds of reason, on the brink of insanity
For some odd reason surrounding me
Too many undeveloped pitiful rhymes, my riddles
I blow minds, I leave ya
Paralyzed when I chisel your spine
A paradise for a monster, is it devine
Abilities is ready to Dine and conquer mine
Will stomp yours and im alot worse
Than a fictional motion pictures
So don't get me confused with Jason or Micheal Myers
You'll be studderin' over my words, tumblin' like clothes in a dryer
Most men perspire, from the first verse
But whats worse ya heads rolling like tires
Like my eyes were when you were flowin
Didn't know to admire
You're just showing you're tired
Well I suggest you leave before she gets cryptic
So when you find mutilated bodies in the crowd
You know who ripped it
