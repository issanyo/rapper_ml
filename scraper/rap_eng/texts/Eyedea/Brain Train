[Intro]
See, I don't know what the fuck it is
Why they always lookin' at me like that
Why!

[Verse 1: Nalyd Ecitsuj]
Why they always looking at me, like there's something on my face man
Damn, No matter where I go, I'm always feeling out of place
And I know I'm not your regular I got a different taste
Probably cause most my life, spent right in my basement
I didn't watch the Super Bowl, I did not drink the alcohol
I don't carry I.D.,I don't drive, I did not go to the mall
I'm extra argumentative and really good at fast talk
I can't dance or sing but I can rap my ass off
Hey my voice is unique, I'll leave it at that
But no rapper you know, has the ideas that I have
And it ain't like the skin color really is significant
Wouldn't put you in a category of part ass or idiot
But I don't try to fit in
My life's is novel of science-fiction
My mission?
To get into your mind, and make you listen and
Rewind what you were missin', everytime that you insisting to be blind
I paint a picture with the rhyme and climb the instrument
I'll hide behind a picket fence, slash a little wickedness and
I win at this

[Hook]
I know alotta people tell you they hate me
Some say I'm a genius others say I'm crazy
I can't help it, It's the way I was raise
Here's a ticket for the train, Pay a visit to my brain [X2]

[Verse 2: Nalyd Ecitsuj]
I only work with a certain type of pen (chameleon)
Switching from an itchy introvert to loudmouth
First thing I do after I buy a CD is open it up, when it's it's out
And see if my name's in the shout outs
I read books, I know the inclono mechanics
Psychology, philosophy, peyote and acid
I like Marshall Mathers more than any rap shit
And my favorite movie's Airheads, that's a classic
Never had a fist fight, got knocked out the one time
Stupid motherfucker thought peace was a gang sign
Yo I never liked the circus I'm afraid of clowns
15 years in the same city still don't know my way around
And still get lost
Inside of my thoughts
Sayin dumb jokes just to hear myself talk
Yeah I know my clothes probably need to be washed
But I like em' and if I didn't I would take em' fuckin' off

[Hook]
I know alotta people tell you they hate me
Some say I'm a genius others say I'm crazy
I can't help it, It's the way I was raise
Here's a ticket for the train, Pay a visit to my brain [X2]

[Interlude]
Do dee doody doddy dee, do dee doddy dee, do dee doddy doddy dee
Here he comes Nalyd E-C-I-T-S-U-J (Pay a trip to my head, that goes for the girls)
The Ecitsuj Way (like my penis i mean)
Oh, Oh it's a verse

[Verse 3: Nalyd Ecitsuj]
I'm not accepted by any certain group or people
I'm a walking talking freak-show and by now you know my steelo
Everybody's weird, you know that's true
I bet you even got a little bit in weirdness in you
My lyrics are due to depression, and an essence impression, unprecedented
Identity, representin' the Midwest I guess I'm just ahead of my time
Blame my pedigree, I'm telling you a tale of the time, embellish the melody
Who are you to say I got a few loose screws, dude?
The tools humans use can never measure my texture
(Oh shit this is where the hook comes in)
(Wait that's the hook guy)
(Well, It's too late now)
(No, do the hook)
(It's too late you're not getting it)
(Nope, Nalyd do the hook)

[Hook]
I know alotta people tell you they hate me

I can't help it, It's the way I was raise
Here's a ticket for the train, Pay a visit to my brain [X2]
HELP ME!
I THINK I'M MELTING (he's fucking melting)

[Verse 4: Nalyd Ecitsuj]
Extra, extra read all about it Nalyd's an extraterrestrial don't let him
Touch you or even sit next to you
Hey I dont write, so you're wrong and that makes me right
Song after song, night after night
Gonna spit my words into this little mic
And the crowd reacts nice if it's something that they like
Now is that so strange to want the attention
If you think I should change, man save your suggestions
I swear someday I'm gonna be somebody's hero
But until that day I'm just another fuckin' weirdo
