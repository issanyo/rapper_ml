With your K-Mart Led Zeppelin shirt
And your Target friendship bracelet
Your Urban Outfitters record shelves
And your extra large condoms
Your dad is a grunge rocker
Your daughter's a republican
I would try to sleep with her
But she's under thirty

I may be insecure but at least I'm not poor
You fuckers should be kissin' the ground that I walk on
You fuckers should be kissin' the ground that I walk on
You fuckers should be kissin' the ground that I walk on
You fuckers should be kissin' the ground that I walk on
Because I'm so fucking cool
