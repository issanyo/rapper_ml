I'm gonna run from the voice of reason 'till it turns to laughter
Against the masquerade like I don't believe in the morning after
The chronicles contain a few hidden chapters
We keep our mirrors dirty, in case vanity backfires
A cold grin curtains hunger pains and eagerness
In one throw you could expose up my weaknesses
I'm putty in your hands kept my ways burned in sand
Until you learn to look through a window no one else can

Oh charity, clarity, honesty excitement
The ruling class, falsely accused, misconstrued
Anger, sorrow, happy, machinery, decisions, collision
Instant gratification, not thinking logically
Programmed to destruct obviously

What don't kill me, will just make me crazier
I'm so filthy, sorry I had to see me like this
I sold you a lie that showed through my eyes
It told you to cry a stained glass suicide
They slowly chiseled down the walls we all hide behind
It's only time before your secrets become weekend headlines
But I'll be fine, suffocating on my own mask
I just wish I could forget how to read between the cracks

Perceptive, unethical, digested tunnel vision
Methadone, real diamond cut tested
Resurrected perfected by well respected professionals
Head doctor, head hunter, scratched the surface
Lost somewhere, accepted own ability transparent open, curves...?

[Repeat 2X]
You're living in a world made of windows and mirrors
Using safeguards covered crystallized tears
In and out different images, same fear
One day it's all gonna shatter, and I hope you're right here...

See through my anxieties and insecurities rip out my insides
Put 'em on display, encaged, enraged and break the bottle
That I've become, I run I jump I grow completely shattered fractured, captured
Glad I had the chance to be so helpless
See through my 4 corner window pane - plain and simple
Brain is crippled walking through a maze
When did I decide to be an object of reflection, crucified for all my imperfections
I answered every question peeling the tint off of my confession

Close your eyes if we can
Death to pride, lets begin
I'm glass and everything's a dream
And I don't miss a damn thing
Broken mirrors don’t bring bad luck, they
Cherish image, how do I look any given day
You can't kill me if you rebuild me
You won't she won't he won't
I gotta do it all alone again goodbye
You fled - no one ever said - there was any peace came out of my head
I’m dead, everybody lies and plays in time before they’re born again
Wipe my slate clean, I wanna skate upon your pretty reddish skin and holler matrimony, mope she broke. And now we know enough about each other everything is shattered!
