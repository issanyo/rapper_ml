I am all that I think
I am the way that my neurons are wired
They fire ions through electrical
Synapses fusing themselves to receiving cells
Building a network that only gets stronger
As I continue the thought pattern
Implied by the process
I make a decision on what to react to
What I perceive based on electrical current
And I am all that I feel
I'm a neurotransmitters' desire
These chemical messengers look for a nerve
With the perfect receptor to fit in
They get in and give it specific instructions
On what to release until this chain
Of events reaches down to the glands which
Then produce every hormone known to
Spread to the tissue of organs
And make them dance
All I can do is breathe
That's how I put out the fire
And all I can do is think
Force my circuitry to rewire
Everything outside is already inside
There's nothing we see that we don't
At least partially make on our own
In our heads so it seems like my duty
To get in my bio-computer and
Pry apart neurons with long-term relationships
That tell my brain to release "feel bad" chemicals
One day I'll be free from the brain
That makes me, me
Now that I know that I'm in control
I can cut my own puppet strings
You are all that you think
You're the way that your neurons are linked
I bet if you don't let it get a little better
It will get a lot worse
All you gotta do is open up and
