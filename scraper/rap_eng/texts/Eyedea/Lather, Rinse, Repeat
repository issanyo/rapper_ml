I have no comments
I'm not your heaven
Less you cut yourself
Into pieces I can understand

Die for your causes
I'll be your witness
You don't always bore me
It's just that you can

They fall around my bones
I can't even escape them again

Find the one who makes the grass green
And it's off with his head
