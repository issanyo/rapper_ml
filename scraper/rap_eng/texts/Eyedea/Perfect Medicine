Two steps ahead of myself following you blindly
Set my faith on fire but the real Larsen (arson) was bad timing
Walking through walls never seemed so uninteresting
You make magic mundane when you put the suicide in sexy
IV upon request Im finally walking on my own
Mama was a coma; Papa was a rolling kidney stone
Send me home with enough thread to keep my wounds closed
Here Lies the Truth was tattooed on the tombstone
The wounds tore, leaking worms out of its newborn scorn
Your perfume performs plastic poetry on my human form
Warm bacteria glowin in the dark, flash cooks the psyche
All Mikey ever wanted was Oliver Hart (all of her heart)
Ill go for a short walk in the long run
When the spores spread to the lungs
Its all nails to the tongue
Failed to accept it all comes to pass
Fight me slow, fuck me fast
Youre still my friend take off the mask
When I heard Ive got this perfect little medicine
Bright enough to blind the sun, it makes my itches interesting
Im a slave, youre a story, but your bravery is boring
Lick your lips, point em at my heart, and cut it open for me
If this was heaven it would have a better backstage
The director keeps pressuring me to act my age
Maybe shes right
If I could squeeze a bit of life out of this empty page
In the book of love maybe Ill push and shove my way
Through this rainy day, changes in my brain made the chains decay
My prescription angel, come and take my pain away
Play your guitar, try to sing out my cough
Found a treasure chest of pleasure, excess marks the spot
Screw in the screws tighter, clip the loose wires
I was truly inspired til my muse told me shes too tired
I had to come and pull the label, didn't read the warning
Running, running, running, running, running can be habit for me
When I heard Ive got this perfect little medicine
Bright enough to blind the sun, it makes my itches interesting
Im a slave, youre a story, but your bravery is boring
Lick your lips, point em at my heart, and cut it open for me
