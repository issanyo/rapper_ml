[Eyedea]
I’m getting in my
I’m getting in my
I’m getting in my
I’m getting in my scary state
It’s only happening yesterday - I can barely wait
Carry the weight, don’t bury me - I’m awake
Don’t be scared of me, be prepared for me -
I taste the same way every parody tastes
So marry me, wait -
Bury me under the lake and carry me to fate and make me feel like I’m not fake
Make me feel like I really have a face
Make me taste, ‘cos right about now - I don’t taste -
My taste buds are fighting eachover over the same negative space -
It’s repetitive waste and yet, I face - my tidal and my fate -
The tidal waves won't crash me today
I won't let ‘em take me, because it’s mine now I’ve got my life jacket -
It’s called rubbing you with a smile
And all I’ll do it is once
Because I don’t have enough time to reconstruct all the things that fuck me up -
And if I did I’d say good luck - you can see me in the sky -
I guarantee one day your plight’ll get stuck
What? Broken, open; molten lava
The same thing that’ll watch ya, until it’s got ya
And the second it’s got ya; it’s gotta do it’s thing
That means the monsters in the bad dreams; you know; the bad scenes
