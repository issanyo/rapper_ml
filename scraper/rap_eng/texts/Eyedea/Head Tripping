I won't let you in my head (4x)
I can't get you out my head (4x)
I can't kiss you I'm too dead (4x)
(I forgive you you're so messy) (4x)

If it is true that you are me
Then how can I be you
And If I am you
Then who are we
And how can we feel new

Knew from the start that we were pushing to the end
I never felt so alive as when I realized that I was dead

Was it selfish not to leave
And would It have been selfish
If I had left

Each healed wound is a moon to help the sun undress
Make a mess miss a month got a rolled silhouette

Take a test
Fail or flunk
Pass or fail
It's still a guess

Naahh, I don't want to leave
I don't wanna stay
I don't wanna have this conversation
If I have to be awake

It's always been a struggle
Every puddle's been a flood (flood)
Trying to build muscle
Cuddle with someone you love

Well, cuddle with the curdled milk scab left unpicked

You can ruin a perfect piece of fruit puttin' sugar on it
Why not enjoy the way it comes without a buzz

I got so lost in lust the picture didn’t even look like us

[Hook]

The way you frown
Always makes me smile
I'm big enough to admit
I'm still a little sadistic child

Yeah I know what it's like to feel like no one likes you
And the only person that you like likes to bite you

Fight truth with your lies
Dead wrong, living right

Like who did you blind just to prove you're sick of sight
I think it might be time to take some time and think it through
If you are me
And I am you
Then how can we feel new?

I judge you
I make you do things
I need to see
In order for me to learn the lesson I've been trying to teach

My tongue won't break your scabs
If they don’t touch your teeth
I'm not ashamed of being deep in love with your ugly

Simply put, I wonder if they understand?

When the thunder hit
All the live stock went dead
Pan slept and slept till awake felt second hand

First things first
I won't let you in my head
