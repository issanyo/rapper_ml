Another window's closed on my dream x16

Eyedea:
Eyes closed, slowly dissipate
Have a stare down with the sun and hope that it could lift away
I can't say I never made a mistake, but people will be people and I can't hate you cause you change
No matter how many times I﻿ rearrange the chairs in my apartment the walls still look the same
I don't know why I'm here but I'm glad I came, I feel lucky to know you by your first name
Let's dance in the grave for your pain;
If I had another chance I'd do it all again the same way
Canvas never threatened the paint
You're still my best friend, the feeling never went away
You make my days dark, and my nights grey
Drive a knife through my heart, I'll try to drive you insane
If I can pull some skin﻿ from my brain, I'll stick a pin in my flesh and carve a smile on my face

Joe Horton:
??????????????????????????????????????????
Great strife, make it stay in the daylight
Wait, wait, the stakes are greater than I anticipated, stay straight, the snakes, attack from behind
Take the foresight, strike it blind
Two of the same kind, let's lose our minds
Step in the slow lane, Racing a long pace
Tell me your own name, n' I'll do the same blame. it's getting late, late
Never let the nightmare separate from my dreams if it means that I could see your face
Place strength into what I always wanted you make outta' this pile o' bricks and this roll of tape
Nothing's ever fair, but﻿ at least it's equal, The lake isn't dry but the beach never ends deceitfully avenged in the middle when I send you a symbol it'll mean that I've given up on wasted faith
