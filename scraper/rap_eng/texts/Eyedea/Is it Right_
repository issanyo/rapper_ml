[Verse 1: Eyedea]
I'm not really dead
This caskets for show
I'm not really alive
I only cry to bring you into my hole
And I will hold you tightly in the name of fucked up
'Till you bite away the staples that connected us

My ribs break every time I get a hug
A billion stars in the sky and I only want to taste one
You're my Jupiter, I'm your junkie
I know you're pretty
I can see it in my ugly
Now I'll put my face down
You can stand on my back
If I drown
Please know that
I'm happy to see you get where you had to get

[Hook]
Is it wrong? Is it wrong?
I still feel like its wrong
Is it Right?
Jokes on you
Is it wrong? Is it wrong?
I still feel like its wrong
Is it Right?
Jokes on you

[Verse 2: Kristoff Krane]
Meet me in the middle where we know each other's pain
And understand the reason that we fight is only cause we feel the same
Angry at each other
We know no ones to blame
We do not need to suffer for what's covered underneath
I care about you too much to abuse true love then lose trust
In what use to touch
But grew immune to using us and getting used
We use it as a crutch
It loses us
But its beautiful
How we go through the bruises
And see each other change

Sometimes I get all blue because I wish I knew
How to love you better
Like I've become a letter
That was sent in June
But it didn't make it till mid autumn
Right before the winter took the light away from the smile
That reminds me you are new

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Crescent Moon]
Reap what your hands sow
Sleep on your land cold
Take what you must take
And leave what you can't hold

Cornered with a paper trail
Bail when nature fails
See the razors
While I'm sipping on sky scraper hail
But a night so stale
And a light so pale I'm walking to it
Gawking foolish
Often stupid
Who is, you to lose it through the bluest eyes she pins me with a thought that's moving by
Drew the line I'm never ending, am I simply losing sight
I, I can't (can't) dance
Dance on wounded lies
Caught a flashback to the backtrack with a Zantac and I'm sui-cide ways walking
The highways talking in my sleep
But the talk is always cheap, get's lost under my feet
Summer creeps like a killer still the thunder sky weeps
Stop to wonder why me
Hear a hundred cries deep
I push with a little more push
Keep on with a little more keep on
For the jukebox broken only plays our favorite R&B song
I hope it plays forever
Fifty train tickets long
Well it'll die whenever
Whatever, so tell me is it wrong

[Hook]

[Verse 4: Impulse]
With the little bit of strength that I still have
Ive been working on a better way to go about my death
And I never took time to take a second look at certain
Instances that left me hurting as a person
I'm witnessing what is better known as perfect
Which you cannot see but that's the purpose
Nervous twitches
Ridiculous mischief
I'm so done with this
Let's just break away
Dull the pains
Make it a point to point out mistakes
As long as we can get it to a level where we both understand that I am happy
I am
I wouldn't lie, I wouldn't wanna pry
I wouldn't wanna see if I couldn't look you in the eyes
Justify, trust the sky
Seek shelter when it's time to make the clouds cry

[Hook]
