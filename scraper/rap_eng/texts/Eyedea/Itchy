I don't know what's wrong
It's nothing special tonight
I just feel like I could use a friend

Sometimes I do too much
Itch my way through the high
Everyone needs something to help them hide

If I die before I sleep
Heaven will look just like a dream
If I go up 'fore you do
I'll save a spot in heaven for you next to me
