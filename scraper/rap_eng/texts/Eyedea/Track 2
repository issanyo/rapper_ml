It's good for me to hear too
It's good for me to look in the rear-view
It's good for me to get a clear view from the mountain top
It's good for me to get up to the bottom then I start to stop
There's no part of my heart that won't get revived by the shock, I won't be alive if I don't stop
So I try to try to just open up my eyes cos I look at what the chemicals I put inside provide
And I never lied, I've probably died a thousand times every time
I thought of what was in my mind it's been there trapped inside of my nightmares and I don't have anything to spare
Light a flare I don't care I don't care that's what they all say, They swear that they don't care but they come to me everyday And say I actually do it's reality too it's not a tragedy foo' and We're all a fool in the king's crown and when we're lookin at The jester we try to bring the sound down now as They're Throwin pies at em and their throwin flys at em, my atom's got Split to a million pieces before and it released all this energy That created this metaphor that put walls on doors and floors On ceilings and you're just pores and spores and your feelings, More is more and less is less but i never protect any part of Your neck unless I get somethin out of it and that's a true Human feeling that i have sorry if it seems selfish but I have To Do it there's no part of me that can be a human being unless I'm getting something from my dreams and I can't be like I'ma Be here for everybody I can't hear anything I can't pretend you Love me I can't hear anything anymore at my door and I know What you're talkin about now I know what that... that's uhh Radiohead song and it's great but i try to escape inside of this Little licking plate giving fate another chance to just flip a Different card. You got Aces? Well it's so basic it's not hard You could look at the face facelift it get's scarred take this From me give me your heart
