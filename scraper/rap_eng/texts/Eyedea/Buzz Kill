[Verse 1 : Eyedea]
There once was a boy
He didn’t make enough noise
He left the wrong cleft and the best of them to destroy
All the people that he tried to employ by being a voice
‘Til he got stuck in the wrong choice -
She said it was her choice
Didn’t know exactly what to do
Same hospital trip, different day; always something new
Now what it had to do with, was the tragic music that plays when your spine sways in contusions
Loses you; and it loses me too
The flame flicker
The liquor, and the brew, and the sicker ways that grew inside of the esophagus when you tried to kiss her but she only blew you with that tragic moment
That tragic accident
Is it really an accident if it’s supposed to be what’s happening?
Now you look at mother nature, and now you’re laughing ‘cos, it’s the only thing you can do to stop being psychopath and touching all the wrong parts of your body tonight
Sorry if I have to hang myself to make you feel alright but I will
‘Cos I know it’s my job, it’s my opportunity in the land of the free, home of the brave new world that’s losing me inside of my head
I’m inside of your head too
‘Til I’m dead ‘til this seed grows up and gets nephews and seek refuge
Please don’t make me excuse you because my breastplate oozes the same goo -
You knew what was going on
Why didn’t you tell me?
Why didn’t you tell me?
You’re the only person I actually know that can help me
But don’t help me, help yourself first ‘cos it’s unhealthy if you’re my nurse and I can’t converse with anyone else -
Because my shadows grow too tall - the medals grow too tall so I’ll have to sit at the bottom level of the straw
And I’ll sit there forever as long as when we breath we can put this all behind us -
We can find what we need
We’ve, only been achieving - only been misconcieved and had enough of the rough and tough life we lead
So let us all bleed
And let us not breed if the seed is something we feel like we don’t need

[Verse 2 : Kristoff Krane]
I have this feeling; it was mother nature
Gave that little seed and that yearling his whole vapor
He swallowed it down inside, no question it was that boy
I can see it in his eyes; I can see that he could never hear the noise
He was deaf, and mute; a mutant -
And ants inside of a colony try to salute, to statues that don’t, hold their pants, up to their belt waist, well down
Melt like I felt the taste of your smell hell-bound
Flesh, ripped now
There’s no, interrogation -
The jury was hurting me and I was trying to stay in the snow
I’m hiding underneath the only thing I know, that’s a cure
It’s the white mirror that I see it, and I smell it; it’s pure
It’s the flowers that I planted - the power that I give to another person
I’m, trying to take down every hour and minute, like it’s all worthless
I’m standing in this moment
Demanding that my focus
Will try and take the selfish ulterior terrier motives
But it’s, holding me back, it’s clenching my flesh
It’s holding me down, it’s got me at my best
It’s my worst taste, I’m fucking standing with that judge -
Trying to push me off of the cliff - he gives me a little snudge - a punch - a push
I fall, I teeter totter - I’m all over the walls -
Skin a [?] - the sky’s just splitting - it’s about to fall
Here it comes, the part of the muscle that nobody’s got the trouble to undertake the underdogs from under the influence - agghh

[Eyedea]
Stretch it out…
What’s it all about?

Three; that’s a magic number

Moon Employer
Nah, I’m not-we’re not really gonna do any songs
Is that cool? Is that alright with you?
