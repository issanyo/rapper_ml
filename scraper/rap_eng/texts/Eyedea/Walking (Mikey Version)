[Verse 1]
All I wanna do is sit here and write
I'm not worried about anything, I'm just living my life
I can't be bothered with anyone else's ideal
Path to success, I pass up that stress
Feel bad for the quest, gasping for breath
Trapped in my head, asking for less rations in death
Passion is left, ashes and just...
Just to sit in the love of an antique box on my window sill
My mask is my flesh, my dream is to grow wings
And sing 'til freedom rings
I got a rhythm but I'm eager to unplug the speaker
And let my heart be my teacher
You're welcome to listen to these words
But I don't know where they come from
I think my soul holds the song of eternity that's undone
It'll never finish, that's the point
But I gotta get going
Thanks for the inspiration

[Chorus x4]
I'm walking
Not cause I'm mad at you or anyone else
I'm walking
Walking until I find myself

[Bridge x2]
Sometimes, the closer you get
The further away it gets
I run towards the rainbow
But when I get there it's gone
So next time there's a rainbow
I'ma run away from it
So when I turn around
I'll see it while it's strong

[Verse 2]
I don't care about my whereabouts, I blare it out
I gotta go, that's all I know, I hit the road and find my soul
And they say, "Listen, if you get a degree, look up and see
What you can be: infinity," but everything ain't anything anyway
I see your eyes and realize I need to cry
But even I attempt to hide (?) would be alive so deep inside
Thanks for your help, but I won't find nothing better
In a world this beautiful, I'll be walking forever

[Chorus x4]
I'm walking
Not cause I'm mad at you or anyone else
I'm walking
Walking until I find myself

[Verse 3]
On this journey, I don't expect nothing but the unexpectable
The only thing I know for a fact is that I'll never know
Too much about myself, so I'ma keep learning
'Cause I'm determined to find what keeps the fire burning
I'm turning these pages just as slow as I can
Reading every single word from the poet within
I flow with the wind and stay content wherever it carries me
There was no beginning and there won't be an end
I'm just a piece of a galaxy, a seed in the soil
A stream of consciousness, to the seasons I'm loyal
Don't take my movement personal, it's not that I don't dig you
But I can't be on the beach of your sea when it boils
And so I walk with the music 'cause to me it's all that's real
I don't know where I'm going, I don't have a plan
I've been hearing instructions my whole life
And I still think walking away from your rainbow
Will make me more of a man

[Chorus x2]
I'm walking
Not cause I'm mad at you or anyone else
I'm walking
Walking until I find myself

[Bridge]
Sometimes, the closer you get
The further away it gets
I run towards the rainbow
But when I get there it's gone
So next time there's a rainbow
I'ma run away from it
So when I turn around
I'll see it while it's strong

[Outro]
Sometimes, the closer you get
The further away it gets
I run towards the rainbow
But when I get there it's gone
And I promise you
If I ever touch a rainbow
I won't turn it into a song
I won't turn it into a song
I won't turn it into a song
I won't turn it into a song
I won't turn it into a song
I won't turn it into a song
I won't turn it into a song
I won't turn it into a song
I won't turn it into a song
I won't turn it into a song
I won't turn it into a song

(Okay, okay, shut up, shut up
Shut up, shut up, shut up, shut up
Shut up, shut up, edit, yeah)
