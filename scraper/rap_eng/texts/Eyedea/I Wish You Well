(YO YO YO person!)

There's a person around the corner
Doesn't need anyone to make them happy
They're perfect for you right now

There's a river growing from the ocean
Doesn't need anything to make it perfect
It's perfect for me right now

And there’ll be plenty more where that came from
There’ll be plenty more where that came from
There’ll be plenty more where that came from
All I’ve got to do is open my eyes

(God, I'm out of tune, it's awesome)

There's a person around the corner
Doesn't need anyone to make them happy
They’re smiling at you right now

There's a river growing from the ocean
It doesn't need anything to make it happy
It's perfect for me right now

And there'll be plenty more where that came from
There'll be plenty more where that came from (Fuck!)
There'll be plenty more where that came from
All I've got to do is open my eyes
(Aww God…)
