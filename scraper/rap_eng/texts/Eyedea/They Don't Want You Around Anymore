Well you tried your best to be something you're not
They already know
Wore your cool guy suit to many friends, it almost worked
But they don't want you around anymore
They don't want you around anymore
They don't want you around anymore
They don't want you around anymore (Yeah)

Well you know that my sex face is solely yours
With built-in blush
Super woman glue to stick to your guns
You sure draw a crowd

But they don't want you around anymore
They don't want you around anymore
They don't want you around anymore
They don't want you around anymore
They don't want you around anymore
They don't want you around anymore
They don't want you around anymore
They don't want you around any mother-fucking more
