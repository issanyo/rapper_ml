Do what's good for your health, man
Always put yourself first
Ill be here when you feel helpless
I don't know which half is worse
The fact that you're a temptress
Or a blessing and a curse
Do what's good for your family
Leave enough for the earth
Fuck it man I just may commit when it's time
To put a ring on you or go down with my pride
I live to waste my hours but our time is running up
Do what's good for your family
Leave enough for the gun

If I were to go to the end of the earth
I'd outcrop the land for you
Sea to shining sea would be your pool
And the sky is your mirror
I don't mean to be so miserable
You're more than I can stand
But I will learn, but I will learn
In due time
Your pain is mine now
My dreams are silk
And spotted with brine now
Being me a gun
Blow my head
I am undeserving of any if not all ways of human comfort
Cut off my limbs
You are pure heroin
All I need now is time
Cut off my limbs
You are pure heroin

Watashi wa nokoshitai

You can walk away but I won't forget your face and
How you made me feel when our hearts were stargazing

I will hold your head while the doctor sticks the needle in
I'll always remember our companionship and what it meant
And on Sunday, October the 5th
You took your last breath, and you will be missed

And I've been so different ever since
Ballads of the broken as evidence
I'm smoking til my lungs start to tint
A shade of black, a shade of black
And I --
Have never seen you in the whole time that we've talked, time that will haunt
And I --
Will never see you in the whole time that I bought, time that is short
And he may have took your eyes in that plaza but they say that love is blind
So you'll miss
All the things, that are amiss
