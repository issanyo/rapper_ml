[Eyedea, in the background, repeating]
I think you're so beautiful

[Kristoff Krane]
And that reminds about when I was
Fourteen and I was with my girlfriend
That I would never consider being with
But my whole life and then I went up to a swing set
And we thought about everything that we would make
Like little tiny babies and I didn't, know but we would go
And then we'd travel, and we would overcome
Every shadow and it would be, the best battle
That I've ever fought
And everything would be happy as can be
And everything is so serene
But then I jumped into the sea with her
And everything dissolved
Everything was invisible I could see the wall
Even all the large organisms got small
No one [?] looked at that and there was a little child
So, even if it repeated itself through history
It doesn't really matter because everything is imagery
And now we'll never um, give in to all of the
Dumb temptations that might tempt me like
She is not the one, maybe she is maybe she's not
But, either way I know that once in a while I touch god
If I've had god then I would be so so, ignorant
To run away from all of that vision I think you're beautiful
As well I think you're beautiful, yeah I think you're beautiful
Yeah I think you're beautiful, yeah I think you're beautiful
Yeah I think you're beautiful, yeah I think you're beautiful
But everything will never make us sane, yeah
