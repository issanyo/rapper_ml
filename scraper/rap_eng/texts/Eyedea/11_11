[Intro]
I can't stand the rain, against my window
Bringin' back sweet memories

[Verse 1: Nalyd Ecitsuj]
Rain
Everyone wants to get out of the rain
Wants to be free, wants to see no more pain
We're guaranteed that the season will change
'Till then, I'm keeping sunshine on my brain
When the drops hit my head they leave a stain
Everyone wants to get out of the rain
We cannot avoid nature's bleeding vein
But I smile while it trickles down the rain
Harvested love only comes after rain
Even though it brings overwhelming strain
It falls from all skies so I can't complain
Without it, our growth would not be the same
Most people like to have someone to blame
But it all falls randomly, not taking aim
It makes up one half of the yin and yang
Without the water, you just can't have the flame
Some are content holding ground in their game
But when my soul steps to exit this frame
I will be reincarnated as rain
So here I come again
Call me rap's reign
Rain
Everyone wants to get out of the rain
Wants to be free, wants to see no more pain
We're guaranteed that the season will change
'Till then, I'm keeping sunshine on my brain
When the drops hit my head they leave a stain
Everyone wants to get out of the rain
We cannot avoid nature's bleeding vein
But I smile while it trickles down the rain

[Verse 2: Nalyd Ecitsuj]
Rain
Harvested thought only comes after rain
Artists may talk and give it different names
When they appear wet, they may feel ashamed
So they don't walk but instead take the train
And when that ride stops they notice the strange
Sense of degeneration they've obtained
While the world evolves, they stand and turn lame
Storm is prerequisite to mental gain
Storm is prerequisite to mental gain
Philosophy's life
That's simple and plain
Poets play with words to keep themselves sane
You do your thing while the clouds pour the
But when the puddles decided to hang
Is when their hands sketched the plans that remained
Every man secretly hopes he can tame
The beast he fears most cause it can't be slain
Towering, gray faces laugh so deranged
One day we all will break free from their chains
One day we all will break free from their chains
And rise towards the sun with good health sustained
It's almost impossible to explain
But I owe all my success to the rain

[Interlude]
11:11
Living in hell and I need heaven
Everyday I count my blessings
Every wasted second marks chances
The devil dances and eventually answers
Let me be accepted 11:11 make my wishes granted
Give me the strength I need
