[Eyedea]
P.E.A.C.E., beat me, is something you won't be able to accomplish
Whatever happened to "We'll never fall the fuck off, we promise"?
I ain't even trying to say it, but... couldn't say it
This is playing with the lyrical style that just slaying emcees
I'm not a mic hog
You know that I'm tight y'all
On the Freestyle Fellowship he's dope but he's the little Phife Dawg
It's all good though
You couldn't flow
You're not cute
Your momma bought some new shoes
So you could look cool but you don't
You not dope
I grab the mic and leave you broke
Emcees, it's done
Drop the mic, go home, you just got smoked

[P.E.A.C.E]
That was cute... like a plush toy
Now half of that shit you just said
You bet it wasn't hype
You know what the girls call me?
They call me Nestl√© Snipes
And they all say
He's a warm chocolate latte
But you's about to get popped up
Take your rock, hey
Dude you know better than to fuck with me
Why you mention my crew?
Why you mention everything about my momma?
What the fuck you do?
Where your album at?
I bust your ass up the same
Hey, I like the way that you was rapping, but I ain't heard nothing today
Now, where your tape? Now, where your CD?
Answer me
Where your money?
You been around the world? say it funny
You lost, you lost, you lost, you lost
I wish your ass was a frisbee cause you straight getting tossed

[Eyedea]
Yo, this battle about to take it
A frigerator getting tossed?
That shit don't even make sense
Try to say it
I grab the mic and get props
I don't got an album but if I did, I quick with it get dropped
Like your whole crew, I got respect for you
But still up on the microphone
I be dissecting you I wreck the crew
Guaranteed do
Emcees like you is queer
You used somebody's little dick to pierce both your ears, you're weird
Fuck, now cease with that shit say
Look at his dopest song, it was "Six Tray"
Don't give a fuck about their weakness
Peace you can't freak this
What I say
Take your ass back to L.A

[P.E.A.C.E.]
Let me tell you
You fucked up again son
You done slipped
You gonna end up mentioning another one of my songs
So you's a dickrider, you been listening, rehearsing
Hold up, wait a minute
I'm producing by the person
From a bitch nigga you damn ho you should be gone
I can't believe you wanted to come here and try to play strong
You want to try to tell somebody to go back home
Nigga, I could take you there today and you wouldn't survive in L.A
I could show you where to play
I could take you take you to the hood
I could make you sit down with the homeboys and they could give you some good tips
But you still want to come up here and act like you the man
Who's about to get diced, sliced, creamed, spit, hope you like getting sliced
Crush that bullshit

[Entering overtime, since the judges ruled the battle a draw at this point. Eyedea's first overtime verse is not in the linked YouTube video, but other footage on YouTube has it.]

[Eyedea]
All right
Check it out
I'm first
And you're the next to rhyme
I'm eating you up
Not the first time but second time
The last time the judges gave you a break
But I'mma show you that you're fake
Take your legs and break them
I like that little intimidating expression you're trying to give me
Emcees try to step to me
I get up in your kidney
Fuck you up like cocaine
[Unintelligible] fake gold chain
You can't hang
Blowing your brains out like Cobain
So try to bring it with that style you ain't intimidating
Penetrating, lyrically creating
You're just faking it
I don't know what to say
I did this once before
But I'm gonna smoke you up quick
Like a blunt
You whore

[P.E.A.C.E.]
Six million ways to lose a battle
Choose one
First of all, you standing on stage
You done choose one
That choose me
Battle P, know what you gonna do
I should set your ass free
And bust yours too
But, look, homie
While you was listening to my tapes
I was back in L.A., trying to make some paper
And do this shit the right way
But you was on some flow shit
Getting up in this motherfucker
Coming with that bullshit
Man, look, I don't like physical exertion
All I like to do is get here and get in your nerves and
Bounce all around like a fucking basketball
Off the chair, off the lens, off the turntable
On that
Back

[Eyedea]
(Host: Final round)
(P.E.A.C.E: Come hard, come hard, or lose it)
OK. I'mma come hard
Check it out
The only way you win is if I let you win
The difference between me and you, testosterone, estrogen, whatever
Girly boy
You can't go the noise
You just annoyed
Want to be like the Beastie Boys
No, I don't even want to say this
You's alarming me
You bit your whole style from Bone Thugs-n-Harmony
[Unintelligible] steady
I dissed you like that
With a tight rap
Emcees don't know how I just be fat
When Eyedea's straight grabbing the microphone, rocking the lecture
That cheap shirt, you'd look good with a pocket protector
Thinking you're fresher
Emcees is [unintelligible]
Your name is P.E.A.C.E
(Host: Time!)
Well I'mma leave P.E.A.C.E. in pieces

[P.E.A.C.E]
Listen you, listen you
You punk ass, pussy ass nigga
Let me tell you something
You done lost your figure eight, ah
Trying to go straight, ah
[Unintelligible]when I jumped off of it
I landed in the water did a backstroke splashing
Are you loving it?
I'm worse than the Little Mermaid
Trying to tell you where she gonna go but she can't
But hey
But I can jump the beat and I can jump the rhythm
All I give you what you looking for
Talk about me all day
Still can't beat me with the floor
I don't give a fuck
Tell that DJ to turn the beat down
Tell him, right now, say it, say it
Tell him stop
(Eyedea: No)
(Eyedea laughing)
Tell him. Tell him stop
(Eyedea: Stop the beat)
Stop the beat
Now, free!
Ah, two times, free, free, free
Three times, free, free
(Host: Time!)
[Unintelligible] I bust the floor like nobody
(Host: Time, time, time)
Don't cut my mic off nigga, please
