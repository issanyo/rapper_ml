[Chorus: Eyedea]
I don’t smile, ‘Cause you’re not
I don’t play dead enough!
Brush you off, turn me on
Blushing brain’s mine to own

[Verse 1: Eyedea]
And what you call on fails
You’re just another season, blowing sun
Taking the wind outta my sails
Braille read your blind spot
Now we see eye to eye
Cross roads, cross the line
Put me on your cross and watch me
Diecast metal plate finish
Before prayer and father rate
Prostate, long live and prosper before Mom to wake
I’m a Saint, you’re a sinner
You’re an angel, I’m a drinker
I don’t wanna move
I don’t want you to be a better kisser
I hate you just the way you are
Less freedom, more fanatic
Every sun is not a star
Let’s be blood brothers
Mayhem scarred
Find yourself And I’ll find me
In pretending I'm who you are

[Chorus]

[Verse 2: Eyedea]
Yes, it’s good taste
Tastes like broken glass
Touch her face
Make no mistakes and hope it lasts
She loves her dead parts
All of her head and some of her heart
The sum of all things is only something falling apart
You’re such a showoff
You’re such a touchy flame
Between feed and fuck
I fell in love with your pain
I make your sequence mine
I hear your deeper cut
I climb the highest mountain just to fall off and land in lust
I stay alive on fire
Put out old flames
Lower my standards and aim for higher
I can’t bring myself to quiet for the choir
Every note sounds the same
Either I’m insane or you’re inspired
Dead to the livestock, I pray for the weak
Thou shalt not be happy till no one disturbs your sleep
You’re such a better you without, me
Such good taste, everything…
