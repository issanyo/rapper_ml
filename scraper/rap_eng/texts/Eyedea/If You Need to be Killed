[Verse 1]
Little needle push my blood back, make my disease gone
Little kitten hear my mousetrap, scratch your own skin off
A little practice makes me perfect, I’m a perfect shot
Little ego does the right thing even when it’s wrong…

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Little mosquito push my blood back ‘fore I make you gone
Little people cross the train tracks, blew their big heads off
Little practice makes me perfect, I’m a perfect shot
Little ego does the right thing even when it’s wrong

[Bridge]

[Verse 3]
All your saviors make you work while your angels watch you bleed
I can be your darlin', devil and everything in between
My gun is empty and it’s only time 'fore it gets to fill
I don’t wanna kill you but I will
