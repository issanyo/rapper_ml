You have the answers(Kristoff Krane)
I wish I had the answers(Eyedea)
I know you have the answers(Kristoff Krane)
[Verse 1: Eyedea}
I severely feel like I don't know
I severely feel like I'm so froze
Severely feel like I should severely feel
When I can get out of that early clearly eery field
And let your ears just peel
She probably missed the first one
Missed the first one
But still I was the first one
That real person
To see another person as a person
And when other people don't see you as such
I know the feeling is naturally hurt
It's okay
It's okay
You're not alone
You're not alone
The wind doesn't blow that way
Cause from where I stay
The wind blows us away from the rest
And together
So we can put ourselves on display for the world
So We can say this is major
This is secret
This is deep shit
This is not but just a weekend favor
This is real
This is something that'll last much longer
Something that's so much later
Something that's so much stronger
Something that's conquered
The monsters that live inside the circuitry
And why are we so purposely
You hired me to first see
What water was spilled
What daughter had guilt
Because she wasn't loved right
What sunshine never really feels lovely
Where do we take ourselves
Where do we carry ourselves
Embrace ourselves
Before we break our help
Cause the only thing we're looking at is the scraping
Melting treef that are scathing
Bathing in the dissected unprotected corrected scathing
That we're all losing
We're bruising our inside of the teeth biting on the same thing
But I'm here
To rip your jaws open even when they're clinched tight
I'm here
I'm here to shed tears
I'm here to stay up all night
I'm here!
And I'll never leave
I'll never leave you
I'll never leave you
I'll never leave you
I'll always believe you
I'll always be-leave you
So put the be in front of it
Put the bumblebee for the birds and the bees
That I guess naturally are running this
Fucking emotional chemical imbalance
That we have
But it's all I have
So I'm fucking glad
And one day I'll be a dad
And we'll walk and the shadows won't seem that deep
The shadows won't come up when we're asleep
The shadows weep for me no more
Cause I'm leaving all the fucking graveyards behind
And I'm polishing up my mind
And I'm leaving you
With one thing to know
I'm yours you're mine
And if the world doesn't know that's fine
We decide
(I'll never leave you)
