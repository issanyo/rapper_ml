(It's-it's it's about time)
(It's-it's-it's it's-it's it's-it's it's about time)

Yo DJ Abilities what you gonna do?
(B-b-b-bout to rock)
Add me to mix, you get E&A crew
And we (Blow up the spot)
Why don't you go ahead and give a taste of what you got

[Verse 1]
Man you killing it, I'm feeling it, you feeling it?
We drill 'em with the cerebellum-swelling-sonics
Surfing over snare snaps
Psycho with syllables, insane with a scratch
My DJ is with me and we ready to get busy
(Let's start it like this!)
Eyedea and Abilities we coming through to represent
The rhyming and the cuttin', never hesitant
To give you something better than the previous
What people think graffiti writers
DJs and the hungry rappers, we the type that
Once we crack the median then co-exist
Immediately everyone is motionless cause
When we come to mediate we devastate
I hope you get the message way too cold to
Play with featherweights in mediocre mental states
We smoke 'em in a demonstration so
We'd like to thank y'all for checking out the show
And if you don't know by now you never know
Some are amateurs but we be pro's
Abilities show 'em what I mean bro

(Time-time-time-time for some action!)
(Go 'head!)
(Yeah!)

[Hook]
And do we got the skills on the turntables and the mic?
(Yeah!)
Is the people really feeling hype?
(No question!)
Them and us is all we needed right?
(Yeah!)
Then we're going to rock the spot tonight!
(No doubt!)

[Verse 2]
Back to the lesson of rap in its essence
The masters will reckon we nasty no question
You asked for the best and this crack in we stepped in
And the fact is we blacklist the wackness
The two of us we doin' stuff to ruin you and your clique
Fasten your seatbelt cause we're going on
A trip to party people, purgatory, end of story
Never slowing in motion
I'm blowing a hole and I'm motor-boatin' opponents
(Oh yeah!)
This is how we play to keep it alive
Put the grooves, them hands in music
Tell me how would you survive?
Fight, give it a like, you win the right, do it tonight
You put an MC, a DJ, and Hip-Hop at the center
(It's a sample of victory here)

[Hook]
And do we got the skills on the turntables and the mic?
(Yeah!)
Is the people really feeling hype?
(No question!)
Them and us is all we needed right?
(Yeah!)
Then we're going to rock the spot tonight!
(No doubt!)
Done!

(Attention to all you punk motherfuckers out there)
If you want incredibly fast relief from the pain of
(The wack, wack)
Try (E-A)
That contains not just one but a combination of
(All types of funk) (Hot shit)
That give effective relief
(True) (Yeah)
If you've not been introduced to (E-A)
By your own physician or dentist
(You're slipping)
(You know what I'm saying?)
I'll repeat the name for you
(E-A, E-A)
(You punk motherfuckers!)
