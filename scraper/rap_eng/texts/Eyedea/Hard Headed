It’s way easier to be square then be there and not be 20 minutes late
It’s easy to put on a jimmy, but easier to hit it raw
Nowadays it’s easier for kids to believe in guns than Santa Claus
How come it’s so hard to stay sober through the rough course of life?
Forget a long-term relationship it’s easier if it lasts one night
One hour, 15 minutes cause sometimes it’s hard to last long, shit
It’d be easy to do it again but I’m not that strong

It's hard to save money for my ride…
Fuck it, it’s easier to have your girl drive me around in your car
It’s easy to smoke a cigarette than it is to deal with cancer
Test is easy if you steal the answers
Hard to be slave
Easy to be a master
Easy to see who’s sexy, but it’s hard to resist letting your
Hand plant a billion and ten seeds in your bed sheets
Tell me where to urinate if you only got a pot to piss in
And is it my position to tell the truth if I know that you won’t listen?
Now you're trippin, cause it’s easy to fit in any religion
When you don’t know yourself and that’s the only help that you're given

Man whatever happens, happens. I don’t ever sweat it
Just let it be known: It’s easy to be hard headed
