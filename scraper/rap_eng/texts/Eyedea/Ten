[Eyedea]:
Pass around the medicine
Pass it all around
Pass around the candles
Burn this place to the ground

Okay
Now the headphones are on
Now I play every part of my life
Like I know the songs
And it's your right to know you're wrong

I see we goin' on this plight
I see you're holdin' on
To last forever
They built me to grasp onto my past
Mask made of leather
Leather made out of skin
From human beings
Leather made out of sin
For bein' in a room and breathing
These same toxins that I breathe in
Carbon monoxide
We're all made of carbon
All from the sea don't hide
From your true nature
As a single celled molecule
Never learnin' how to split
Until someone follows you
Being a teacher
The same as being a leader
It's just your ego, bleeding
And you don't even need it either
It just stops you from actually progressing
It keeps you from seeing how everything was connecting
And it does the same to me
Cause most the time when I refer to you
I'm actually referring to me
And furthermore what's overdue is an apology
For all the lies I've told
I don't really lie all that much
But when I do, I know
It cuts me to the bone
Even if it's just a little white lie
Lookin' inside of the night sky
Frightened by the look in your eyes
I could've died
Every time that I've hurt
Even if it was just some lame thing that came outta my head
When we would converse
And I love your songs so much
It feels great to just be your friend
Look your eyes and understand that fate's not
Somethin' you can plan
We're all on this same road
You know like Brian said
It's just how the story's told

You know?
It doesn't even have to make sense anymore
It's just me trying to get through these walls and doors

I've been tall before
But I've also been small much more
I've been so tall before
But I've been so small much more
I've been so tall before
But I've been so small much more
And... you know what I mean
