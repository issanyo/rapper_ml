I wait for you, in heaven
On this perfect string of love
And drink your soup of magpies in a pottery bowl
Looks as I am now
Brown, round and warm

Chime on a rain wet
An ankle toes or two
Sweetly as it drops upon your head
Just like it did today
Fortunately gone (Bah bah bah)
I wait for you
Fortunately gone (Bah bah bah bah)
I wait for you
