Weird side! Ladies and germs!
It's my pleasure to introduce to you
Your leader and savior, Oliver Hart!

I just wanna send a special, special thank you today
Anyone who donated a little of something in the collection can
God won't forget you

Now see, this next song is a song about writing this song
Now I'm not some profound visionary but this specific incision didn't particularily take too long
I was just running up these backstage stairs
And suddenly it dawned on me
What a good idea, true inspiration
But with no pen or paper to record the creation
I aborted the plans of grand innovation
And stood bored pacing on the wood floor waiting for more wars to pour from my cranium
Maybe I'm not cut out for this writing gig, I thought for a brief second
But then it was like the lightning hit through me in a complete headspin
And kept punching me with phrases concepts rhyme patterns and song structures
A long flux that dropped fire 'til I was finally finished
And in a matter of minutes consciousness is linked with the inventive infinite
And one of my friends happened to have a pen
So I wrote it all down on my hand
That was that

Thank you
We're just gonna
Thank you thank you
We're just gonna pass the collection can around one more time
Try to find it in your pockets and hearts to donate all your money
God won't forget you
