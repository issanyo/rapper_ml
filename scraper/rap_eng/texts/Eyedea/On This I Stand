[Verse 1:]
On this I stand
Two sets of footprints placed ahead of the dirt softened from tear drops
And overlooking the earth as the son of the moon
Protected by a forcefield of pure thought (On this I stand)
A rally of unemployed disgruntled words long for long journeys to somewhere
Somewhere that only caused me pain as I strain my soul cramming it with light
So I can bring some there
I bleed the blood of a cold stone that rolls without a shadow
I'm only deep enough to realize that I'm shallow
My head I keep it up, but its hard to keep it straight
When you don't believe in love
And you just can't cope with hate
Metal rust, leaves turn into dust
As the difference between love and lust clarifies as trust
If you only had an hour to sum your whole life up
Would you spend that hour sayin' that an hour ain't enough?
I've escaped the shell that bound me to cowardice
Now I'm faithful to the wind, but compared to it I'm powerless
The first step was made, and it was a fair accomplishment
The pond was sittin' still, so I threw a rock in it
And as my reflection rippled, it all became clear
Seasons always change so there's no reason for fear
We made an autobiography of our pivotal years
It's all I got and I'm giving it to you because I care

[Interlude (spoken):]
A lot of the time humans, as artists, exist in a self-projected state of falsehood
We're either too close to our image to be objective in our perception
Or too far away to be subjective in any matter
This only widens the void in social conformity introduced to our souls at birth
And so I write, but
I don't write without the intention of objectivity or attention on the image
But only as an omni-directional bridge between the several, floating, tunnel-structured realities present in incomparable space and time
See I don't write for the future, I write about the future, for the present
I write with my past, about the future, for the present

[Verse 2:]
(On this I stand)
The oasis of the limbo, adjacent to my generation, facing out the window
Waiting for some ventilation, patient while the wind blows
Graceful in its demonstration, overall innovation
(On this I stand)
A fountain of youth sovereignty, a thousand syllables more than a pound of flesh
A deep breath of achievement, a dream and a wake-up call
Another haul of the quest
(On this I stand)
A letter to civilization
(On this I stand)
The purity of creation
(On this I stand)
A paradigm for self
(On this I stand)
A 'thank you' for your help
(On this I stand)
My first born child
(On this I stand)
Something for now
(On this I stand)
Life, love, death, and hate
(On this I stand)
An album, glad you could relate. Peace...
