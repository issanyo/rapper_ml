[Verse 1]
Boyfriend, girlfriend, Jameson, Vicodin
Life under pressure, we take death over selfishness
Forever never again, win, lose, or draw -
Blood sever all ties from wrist to rush, now I hope -
It’s not too much to pride me for my promises
Coughing up my cramps, I can taste the iron in your honesty when -
Forced puppy-dog eyes cry placebo rain
The hatred still grows just like it was the real thing
You do your magic on a voluntary amputee
Couples eat together, sleep, and fuck each other’s self esteem
Wire me shut. Let the rate of implode increase, I can push harder this cyst never bleeds
I’ll be your sister, we’ll kiss by the creek
I'm dumb enough to let your silence talk me into a speech
Jump to conclusions, fall between the cracks
See the smile slip off your face and put it’s hands around your neck
It kills two birds for the price of one happy hour, bad day; good times are for the dumb
We’re chasing the paradise without a pulse anticipating seizure sleeping with my hand inside my mouth

[Bridge]
Avoiding your soft spot's so hard…
Avoiding your soft spot's so hard…
Avoiding your soft spot's so hard…
Avoiding your soft spot's so hard…
Avoiding your soft spot's so hard…

[Outro]
Control is your art
