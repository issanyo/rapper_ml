[Eyedea]
I wake up, sun between the clouds
It feels really safe
But that's only because it's right now
It feels really safe
That's only because it's right now
It feels really safe
But that's only because it's right now

And how, did I get so lost?
How did I get stuck inside of these
Fucking stupid thoughts?

And now you're stuck in the same extinction
And I can see the pain in your brain
While you're thinkin'
It never hides inside of a bingey weekend
Another dingey part of your brain speakin'
It always boils down to that little muscle in your head
The way the neurons connect
The way you hate me
As much as you embrace me and you bet
You taste me, you pet me like I'm your pet

Baby baby baby, babe on a roller coaster
No seatbelt, the heat melts me till I'm over
Hold her, up to the highest light
Put a candle in the sky
Watch the sun get pissed off tonight
