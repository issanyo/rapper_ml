[Intro: Eyedea]
Lady's and Germs, it's my pleasure to introduce to you, your leader and savior, Oliver Haaaaaaart (Thank You), give him a warm welcome y'know[?]

[Verse 1: Eyedea]
So I says to the guy "Hey, I'm writing a screenplay"
But Pavlov did pair it with an unconditioned stimulus for a reason
And whoever murdered prophecy can expect a prize from me
And at the exact same time in a totally different novel much stickier than this one came the life of a salesman when card houses crumble
Dammit what word rhymes with "Hide the spike?"
Hey uh... can I borrow one of those cigarettes?
I don't know, I don't smoke

[Verse 2: Eyedea]
I keep my gin even with the sun of the evening so I don't succumb to the sorrow
A martyr racing a snail, a yard or so behind him
I roam the streets with a necklace made of shark skulls
And a tooth in the ground that's how I leave my mark

[Verse 3: Eyedea]
Don't you think American Beauty was way better than Fight Club?
I mean did Einstein reject quantum mechanics because uncertainty's were devils or is that flower just not worth plucking?
It's intriguing, jeez [?] fucking phone cords
I know a song you don't know
I bet this glass will still be see-through next year
Hey uh... c-could you order me another beer?
I don't know, I don't drink

[Verse 4: Eyedea]
Bell's theorem suggests certain information can travel faster than the speed of light
But I keep flashing back to the first time I broke my teeth
So smile strong, breathe good
And one of my friends happened to have a pen
So I wrote it all down on my hand
And that was that, thank you

[Outro: Eyedea]
We're just gonna pass the collection can around one more time...
