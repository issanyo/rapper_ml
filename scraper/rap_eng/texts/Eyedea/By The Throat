[Verse 1: Eyedea]
Oh how easily they forget no anchor to the past
Cut the blood supply and hope the heart beats itself to death
My ribcage is now my own still feels like your arms neck clothed in salt
How'd I let it go this far?
It happens faster than you could ever think
From always and forever to never again in less than a blink
The river runs until it's dry
But I die spitting my last drip into it's mouth to keep it alive
Long drives, wide eyes, and your smiling face
You dance I drink, let's waste the night away
They say you always know right away
But you can't foresee your sand being pulled into the sea under a tidal wave
Secrets leak out when you're asleep
Coming from a queen's mouth, talk isn't all that cheap
I'm now a lone flame searching for a purpose
Setting fires everywhere I go, can't avoid the burns
We shared pain
You took me by my throat and made me understand the world as if I were you and I couldn't breathe
And you can lead a horse to fresh water but you can't teach it how to be okay when you decide to leave
I'm lost, there's no one to protect
I got so used to being shelter from the rain that always followed you
It's not my first time, actually it's nothin new
But that doesn't make it any easier to get through
The snow won't melt, smoke won't clear
Turned hope inside out a thousand times trying to see if it was ever anything more than dressed up fear
But the two go hand in hand you can't have one without the other being there
I'm barely breathing waiting for the spins to end
Begging a god I don't believe in to let me sleep so I can dream again
We went through thick and thin
Came out separate on the other end
But please know no matter what you'll always have me as a friend
And I finally know
Your crime is your pride and your past is my only ghost
I'm going crazy out of my control
But there's nothing I can do, I have no choice but to let it go
Each day gets a little less intense
I no longer feel like there's someone standing on my chest
You made me more me, and I won't forget the times you helped my find my feet
When I was buried in my head
Thank you, for giving what you had to give
Taking what you had to take
And making me believe in you
Even though I might be gone forever there will always be a place in my brain that will think of you
You look so graceful when you're flying
Keep going, there's a lot of world that you haven't seen
You have my best wishes, even if only in silence, you deserve everything that you've ever dreamed
The snow melted right when the smoke cleared
I turned love inside out a thousand times trying to see if it was ever anything more than the will to persevere
But the two go hand in hand, the clouds surrounding you eventually will clear
I can breathe I found contentment in the end
Telling a god I don't believe in to go to sleep so I can think again
We went through thick and thin
Came out separate on the other end
But please know no matter what you'll always have me as a friend
