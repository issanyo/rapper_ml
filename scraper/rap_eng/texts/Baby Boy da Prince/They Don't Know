Baby Boy, Nina Sky

They Don't Know How You Make Me Feel
And They Don't Know What You Do To Me
Just Nobody Has To Know, Nobody Has To Know

Look, They Don't Really Know 'bout The Things I Do
And They Don't Really Know 'bout The Pain We Go Through
So I Shot Down Everything And I Gotta Let You Know
This Industry Shit Hard And It Ain't No Joke

Paparazzi In My Face, Paparazzi In My Hair
Paparazzi Over Here, Paparazzi Over There
But I Don't Care 'cuz Im Always On Time
Right Up In The Game, Now I Finally Got The Limelight

Sexy Rock Star And She's Pretty Like A Mutha, Man
Ill Crack Up If She Leave Me For Another Man
Yeah, You Know Im Real And, Yeah, You Know The Deal
I Just Gotta Let You Know How You Really Make Me Feel

They Don't Know How You Make Me Feel
And They Don't Know What You Do To Me
Just Nobody Has To Know, Nobody Has To Know

I Be Happy Everytime I Hug My Girl
I Be Happy Everytime I Rub My Girl
And I Love Her So Much, Id Give Her The World
The Moon, The Sun, And The Stars Up Above

Our Love, Man, Is So Outrageous
Our Trust, Man, Is So Amazing
Dusgustin' Never My Baby
Fussin', No, Not Lately

Everytime Im With My Girl, Man It Drives Me Crazy
I Try Not To Lie 'cuz I Don't Want Her To Hate Me
I Gotta Keep It Real, I Gotta Keep It Trill
If I Didn't Do This Shit This Wouldn't Be The Way I Live

'cuz I Can Get You Off My Mind, Boy
Im Grateful Everyday That Your Mine
Tried Lovin' But I Could Not Find The One
But Lovin' You Has Taken Me High

They Don't Know How You Make Me Feel
And They Don't Know What You Do To Me
Just Nobody Has To Know, Nobody Has To Know

They Don't Know How You Make Me Feel
And They Don't Know What You Do To Me
Just Nobody Has To Know, Nobody Has To Know
