[Intro:]
Say fresh we goin back home on this one right here ya heard me
See the ladies was buckin from left to right
And the dudes was thuggin from side to side
It was a bum, bum bum, bum, bum bum snap
And a ickeh ickeh fresh and i added a clap

And get the party jumpin for the rest of the night

[Chorus:]
Homie I'm so fresh and I'm so clean
My wrist on bling with a fresh Soly
3 Hundred dolla jeans with a grill on bean
With a bundle in my jeans and its real homie
Naw meen ay ay naw meen [x4]

With a bundle in my jeans and its real homie
