I just left the mall ,  man it was breeze
I kept it 100, 100 like degrees

The more a n*gga write , the confidence increase
I been up for plotting I think I'm losing sleep

He be hollin
Man Kyle wildin
He put the the time in

They can't stop me I'm way to cocky
This ain't my hobby

I made my it lifestyle
They like how
My mom proud
Word drizzy drake I pop style
Undefeated like mike brown

In the playoffs
Y'all be taking y'all be  shots be way off
I'm focused on the wins cuz in the end it's gone pay off

Adolf hitler with the hits don't make no Sense
The heat I'm dropping , drop the ep it ain't flopping
I'm hungry n*gga  no stoppin

I'm poppin like I'm Chris breezy a breeze man this TOO easy . Got shawty she tryna tease she told me her n*gga cheesy


Gone head then
I'm bringing bread in
She throw at me I catch it like I was ted gin
If she too much wit the fuss i leave her on read then
She call her friend once again like can u text him


Dropped a couple tracks guess I'm 2-0
They like Kyle rapping guess they didn't know

I guess it didn't show
I was made like this
Doing shows on the road
I'm getting paid like this
Huh

I'm feeling like drake on this
J's on feet Apple Watch in wrist



Never focused on the opposition
Killin the competition
I think I got the vision

Tommy  cruise with the mission but
Nothing  impossible If they ain't heard they gotta know I'm
Leaping the obstacles


I must be the chosen one like Mary and Joseph son
And I ain't even close to done
U ain't even a close to one
As far as legends I am the closest one
2 or 3 I'm close to 1
I speak my mind don't hold my tongue
