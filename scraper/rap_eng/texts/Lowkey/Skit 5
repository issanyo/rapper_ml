[Norman Finkelstein]
Go Ahead

[Woman]
Hi, um, during your speech, you made a lot of references to Jewish people as well as certain people in your audience, not Jewish people in general, but certain people, especially in your audience, to Nazi's
Now that is extremely offensive when certain people are German, and their also extremely offensive to people who've actually suffered under Nazi rule (Crying)

[Norman Finkelstein]
I don't respect that anymore
I really don't
I don't like and I don't respect the crocodile tears to con, the crocodile tears (Jeers and Applause)
No, answer folks, erm allow me to finish, and allow me to, allow me to sr
Listen sir, allow me to, allow me to finish
Sir, sir
I don't like to play, I don't like to play before an audience, the holocaust card
But since now I feel I com, Now I feel compelled to. (Shouting)
My late father was in Auschwitz, my late mother, please shut up! (Applause)
My late father was in Auschwitz, my late mother was in Majdanek concentration camp. (Shouting)
Every single member of my family, on my father's side, on my father's side. (Shouting)
(The Jews cannot take odds against the Germans!)
My father was in Auschwitz concentration camp, my late mother was in Majdanek concentration camp
Every single member of my family on both sides was exterminated
Both of my parents were in the Warsaw Ghetto uprising
And it is precisely and exactly because of the lessons my parents taught ME and my two siblings, that I will not be silenced when Israel commits it's crimes against the Palestinians, and I consider nothing more despicable then to use their suffering and their martyrdom to try to justify the torture, the brutalization, the demolition of homes, that Israel daily commits against the Palestinians, so I refuse any longer to be intimidated or brow beaten by the tears
If you had any heart in you, you would be crying for the Palestinians, not the Western [?] (Applause)
