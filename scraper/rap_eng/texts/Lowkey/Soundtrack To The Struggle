[Intro: Lowkey]
It's been a long time coming
Too long, too long
It's been in the making a quarter century
But it's here now, it's here now
If by time you hear this album, I'm not here you know why

[Hook: Mavado]
Tell ya
So mi say
Too many suffering too many tears
To see a youth die I’m a know him for years
When me look around nobody care
The people dem a live inna fear
The system need to change right now
To much you do could a inna grieve right now
I know si the bigger is a give right now
After ghetto people A no steep right now (Woo ooh! oi!)

The system need to change right now
To much you do could a inna grieve right now
I know si the bigger is a give right now
After ghetto people A no steep right now (yeah yeah!)

[Verse 1: Lowkey]
My music Is my natural resource, now I want it back
'Til I sever every single chain I will not relax
Just constant attack, 'til my world looks like Montserrat
Contact my comrades, for combat, what's conscious rap
When you say the truth, they attack like a Sabre-tooth
Thinking clear they make you disappear like you hate the fruit
We don't need more Boeings, we don't need more Rebors, weed or Lyor Cohens
They tell us about terrorism and tell us about terrorists
Look up the definition and tell us what terror is
Only know the definition if the television tells us it
Public Enemy #1 they treat me like Professor Griff
This album has been in the making a quarter century
Born to bless the beat and rap over recorded melody
I knew the truth since I was a small little boy
I am a product of the system I was born to destroy

[Hook: Mavado]
Mi can’t believe a suh dem treat people
Dem deh ya fi protect and dem a beat people
And mi nuh see nuh system fi de street people
Can’t believe dem a de lead people
The system need fi change right now
Too much youth a go down inna grave right now

[Verse 2: Lowkey]
On the news, they glorify their own henchmen
Support the troops, but won't mention Joe Glenton
It's funny 'cos the rappers are posing as the gangsters
While the government taking money as bonuses for bankers
In life you learn, to close your eyes and hold your tongue
But together we will overcome, there's never been a chosen one
Still tryina understand, the land I stand on
I'll probably die from cancerous anger like Frantz Fanon
I will never give up, I will never just quit
I will never give in, I will never submit
The reason that I came, Is bleeding from the veins
Of the people 'cause we're equal, only freedom is the aim
This album has been in the making a quarter century
Born to bless the beat and rap over recorded melody
I knew the truth since I was a small little boy
I am a product of the system I was born to destroy

[Hook: Mavado]

[Verse 3: Lowkey]
If you're subordinate to corporate guys supplying your orders
You're fighting fire with fire, I'm fighting fire with water
When they kill me, I know I'll die with a focused mind
Plus there will be millions of me, ready to multiply
Don't just mention, acknowledge me, remember to honour me
My pen and this honesty, defended equality
Declared a republic, and ended your monarchy
Your corporate dictatorship, pretends it's democracy
I hold your bloodline, accountable for every crime
Adam Smith to Rothschild, It's all been a clever lie
Two choices now, revolution or genocide
But thanks to Rupert Murdoch neither one will be televised
This album has been in the making a quarter century
Born to bless the beat and rap over recorded melody
I knew the truth since I was a small little boy
I am a product of the system I was born to destroy
