Yeah, you know you never got on with my mum and all that man
Well this... this is for you baby, this is why

[Verse 1]
When I met you, I didn't just wanna press you
You were special, I knocked off every other chick except you
I treated you well, in hindsight maybe too well
I forgot myself and cared too much how you felt
You say you love me, you need a history test
If you loved me surely you'd wish me success
I wasn't just in it for sex, trust me I never was
There was something about you that made me think I fell in love
I even feel stupid when I put it in lyrics
It was on my mind all the time but I wouldn't admit it
So after knowing you a month I put you next to none
Made you one of three girls that ever met my mum
And it wasn't really surprising she didn't like you
But despite that I still wanted to wife you
We told eachother our deepest and darkest secrets
Now we are where we are man I can't believe it

[Chorus X2]
So low, I don't trust you like them other heads
I should've known you were too quick to jump in bed
Don't try to make it better because the love is dead
It turns out you ain't shit like my mother said

[Verse 2]
Somewhere along the line you started acting funny
The way you were chatting, frankly I had to worry
You called me to talk but really you'd whinge
You'd developed an obsession with material things
In a second you would switch from good to bad
And all you did was bitch about the things you couldn't have
I would've given if I'd had it but there was nothing I could give
You'd scrape by day to day fronting like you were rich
It was sick (it was sick) you went to crazy measures
Finding bare different ways to make me jealous
I didn't need that on top of my daily pressures
But still somehow we stayed together
Always in my ear talking pessimism and hate
From head to toe the very definition of fake
Just another lost girl that envied the attention
But you really crossed the line when you pretended to be pregnant

[Chorus X2]
So low, I don't trust you like them other heads
I should've known you were too quick to jump in bed
Don't try to make it better because the love is dead
It turns out you ain't shit like my mother said

[Verse 3]
You don't want me as a boyfriend, you want me as a fuck friend
Don't be surprised if I treat you like a slut then
Looking back I should have trusted my mum
Because you still call me back every couple of months
Blatantly just looking for sex (looking for sex)
So obviously I just couldn't reject
I can't lie I had fun but you were still crazy though
You only called me because you heard me on the radio
Still I got feelings but what do they matter
You told me that everybody wants to be a rapper
I know you well I know exactly how you think
And no way I won't take you out for a drink
Now my only regret is hitting it raw
I might as well have slammed my dick in the door
Because the sex is something that really I didn't need
And now I think you might have given me a disease
