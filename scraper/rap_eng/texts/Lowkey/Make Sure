[INTRO]

(Yeah, yeah)

[VERSE 1]

Did something change the feeling now?
Heart to hearts, eye to eye, I'm never seeing now
PS, that BS
Nah, we ain't gotta be about it
Drama, drama, drama, we ain't gotta be about it
Nah

I try to say the realest rhymes
She think she really need my money
She just need to grind
Go make your own so you ain't needing mine
Go make sure own so you ain't needing mine
(These type of girls I just need to find)

Don't say no more
Cause she ain't party, you can find your own
And you can hold me down or I can fly alone
Cause I'm higher in my zone
Yes I'm higher in my zone

And I ain't tryna leave so please don't push me out
And please don't let me go
Cause, girl you never know you never know I might blow
Then I'll make sure you hear about it
I'll make sure you hear about it
Yeah
