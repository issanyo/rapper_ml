[Verse 1: Joey Whatever]
Hella dope in my backpack
That bitch old you can have that
I’ve been on one on two
Let me back track
(Do you love me?)
Why the fuck you gotta ask that?
Fuck her good now my back scratched
All this coke gotta bag that
Bad bitch and her ass fat
And I’m gonna eat it like a snack pack
Baby girl let me grab that
Flip some work like a flapjack
Got a problem better back back
Before I go and grab my black mask
Shoot your feet and make you tap dance
I need my money this your last chance
I need my money where my cash at?
And I’m doing whatever I wanna do
Ang I’m going crazy looking for trouble to go get into
And I love it when I fuck her and she take it yeah she do
That’s my fucking mother fucking boo
When she suck it she the truth
Take a lil break cause your face is turning blue
I swear this bitch the truth when I walk up in the room
She stand straight up look at daddy and salute
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah

[Chorus: Joey Whatever]
It’s 4 in the morning
And you know what she snorting
I’m lost in the moment
With my bitch and she gorgeous
I’ve been grinding for a long time
Yup a long ride
I want it all, yeah
Like it’s all mine

[Verse 2: Joey Whatever]
Watch me get it with my mother fucking G’s
I’m gonna be exactly what I’m wanna be
I’m gonna see all the things that I’m gonna see
Keep a bad bitch on her knees
And she never wanna leave
Bitch you gotta go
Cause I’m trying to get some sleep
And I don’t nap with hoes so get away from me
I’m just trying to fuck and make that pussy cream
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah

[Chorus: Joey Whatever]
It’s 4 in the morning
And you know what she snorting
I’m lost in the moment
With my bitch and she gorgeous
I’ve been grinding for a long time
Yup a long ride
I want it all, yeah
Like it’s all mine
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh yeah, yeah
Yeah
