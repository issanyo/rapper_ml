[Intro]

Ive been moving slowly
(like a turtle, time, and more)
Time, time
(like a turtle, time and more)
Ive been moving slowly, slowly

[Hook: IRAI Ouree]
Im running away, away
Im running away, away (as long as you)
Imma have to show you what it is, girl
Imma have to show you what its really gone, be
Honey Bee, after B is C, you see me
Im running away, away
Im running away, away (as long as you)

[Verse: IRAI Ouree]
Im loving my life, loving my life, loving it right
Blunt is my life, Tamera my high, Tamera my wife
Tamera my type like fire and ice
I be the guy Icee the I
And I got a million complications
This blunt burning on my lip like the face of Satan
My eyes low I think I need a motherfucking face lift
And lets face it, basic cops racist, pray for my babies
Everybody want to live they life (right?)
Everybody want to try to live it right (live it right)
But left they morals to the side
Want to slide every time I recline and I rhyme I decline to
(Purchase your tracks today)
Cause all you niggas weak
And on the seventh day Jesus sleep
And lyrically nobody waking up me
Ice

[Hook: IRAI Ouree]
Im running away, away
Im running away, away (as long as you)
Imma have to show you what it is, girl
Imma have to show you what its really gone, be
Honey Bee, after B is C, you see me
Im running away, away
Im running away, away (as long as you)
