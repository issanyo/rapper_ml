[Intro: Lowkey]
Yeah, Got a Story To Tell Part 3

[Verse: Lowkey]
This is the story of twins separated at birth
The same time their mum was getting placed in a hearse
In Part 2 she said give em any paper that's hers
But all she left was a dress and the change in her purse
Once upon a time she had money but lost it
So the 2 boys she gave birth to got adopted
One twin Derek went with David and Leslie
If you ask the neighbours they'd blatantly say that they were friendly
But David beat Leslie, as for Derek she blamed him immensely
As a baby David patiently played with him gently
The other twin Andrew went with Samantha and Mike
A couple with money who handled him right
Andrew lived in the biggest of homes
They never said he was adopted, they raised him as their own
You could say Andrew was spoilt, always getting everything
While Derek was getting told his real mum rejected him
The things Leslie said gave him scars deep within
It wasn't too long 'til David started beating him
Derek wasn't ever taught right from wrong
Andrew had it all but never felt he quite belonged
Derek went to a school where the teacher didn't care
Andrew went to a school where everybody cared
Derek screamed at night, there wasn't anybody there
They were both intelligent but the level wasn't fair
When Andrew got good grades he got extra pocket money
Derek got bullied for that shit man it wasn't funny
'Cause Derek was smart and kindhearted
But he felt unwanted ever since his life started
Andrew was popular at school and top of the class
Captain of the team, his dad would come and watch at the park
The twins were as different as opposites are
Grew separately and never felt the loss of their Marge
And neither knew the other one even existed
As Derek got older, the beatings persisted
'Til one day he switched on David, you should've seen his face
Next thing he's locked up for GBH
So Derek went prison, Andrew went to university
Tell me, out of these 2 youths would you prefer to be?
Derek just wanted to heal
As for Andrew, he just wanted to feel what was real
At uni he got introduced to the drink and the drugs
First came booze, looking for chicks to link in the pub
Soon he was getting smashed on his own
Then he started smoking, he went from smoking ash to the chrome
Not long after that he found pills
From that moment on it was all downhill
Soon came, the mushrooms and the speed
Drugs went from recreation to something that he needs
In his 3rd year he dropped out, it wasn't to be
As for Derek, behind bars he got a degree
So Andrew decides he wants to become a shotter
And Derek decides that he wants to become a doctor
That was always exactly what his dream was
To pay his way through medical school, he works 3 jobs
Andrews back living with his dad and his mum
Didn't bother to hide the drugs he had in his drum
His parents wonder what happened to the boy he used to be
A was introduced to B and through B introduced to C
Andrew was slowly losing his mind
He tried to shot but he got robbed numerous times
It was a fluke he was fine, up in the club shooting them lines
Without a clue what to do with his life
'Cause that morning his dad Mike had told Samantha
That at the doctors he'd been diagnosed with cancer
So Andrews nowhere to be found, a man missing
And Derek has almost achieved his ambition
The day Derek reached the dream of his lifetime
It was deep, that same evening Mike died
When Andrew found out, he just couldn't take it
He straight flipped, went out and got fucking wasted
So now Andrew's on his way to the hospital Derek's in
'Cause he spent his inheritance on heroin
And just OD'd, so please listen closely
To the reason this whole story is so deep
While Derek was in the canteen resting eating food
Andrew died next door and he never even knew...
