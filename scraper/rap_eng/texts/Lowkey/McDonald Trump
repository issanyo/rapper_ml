McDonald Trump, Mc-McDonald Trump
McDonald Trump, Mc-McDonald Trump
McDonald Trump, Mc-McDonald Trump
El pueblo unido jamás será vencido // shut him down
McDonald Trump, Mc-McDonald Trump
McDonald Trump, Mc-McDonald Trump
McDonald Trump, Mc-McDonald Trump
يا مجرم يا فاسد القدس تاج راسك // Shut him down!

[Verse 1: Lowkey]
700 billion a year to the fossil fuelers
750 billion a year to the rocket launchers
This monster's morbid mob is sordid more than what's reported
While this song's recorded, hope a hundred humans cross the borders
Words of MLK, greatest violence purveyor
See ourselves in the afflicted, the environment decayer
Do it for Puerto Rico and Ibrahim Abu Turaya
He'll get Ahed Tamimi while he's tweeting London's mayor
Harbingers of doom, they let the Trump committee galavant
Passport not accepted, it's a London City travel ban
Dystopian future like Amazon's camper vans
Merely an apprentice to the corporate gangster glamour gang

[Bridge: Lowkey]
ExxonMobil are writing this Trump script
The Koch brothers are riding this Trump ship
Wall Street is writing this Trump script
Raytheon and Lockheed riding this Trump ship, shut him down

[Verse 2: Lowkey]
The red face can't contain the rage and hate inside ya
Aching in your pride but take a major nation, make it minor
Engage in nativism, now your state is just a paper tiger
Cover up your face with a solar panel made in China
A weapon of mass distraction in this twisted age of decadence
Government, big business, the relationship incestuous
Hope workers in your businesses unionize and shut you down
A million people march when you try to enter London Town
Do another speech to inspire the next militant
May your nightmares be haunted by vexed immigrants
Mother of all bombs, I hope that every death lives with him
Corporate revolving door from Bannon to Rex Tillerson

[Verse 3: Lowkey]
It's a kakistocracy that acts illogically
Gangsters and bankers kidnap your policies
Grand hypocrisy, expand the poverty
This man's philosophy is rampant robbery
Left Puerto Rico abandoned and on its knees
Massive horror scenes, no plans for college teams
Onslaught wants more handguns on the street
To ban democracy and crash economies
Fake news in the flesh, great at using the press
Ruminate on who to hate when you accumulate debt
The food chain stretched from your goons that invest
Desecrate the state an unusual death
Wanna idolize sly guys who would you guess
Surprised hope they privatize his funeral next
Lucid effect on who you choose to elect
When expansion is limitless what future is left
The system was was fixed for him, sicker than Nixon
With Clinton, Winston and Kissinger mixed with him
The missiles are blistering, pistols on kids
And he spits on the immigrants, isn't it interesting
Donald Trump and his forked tongue, let 'em all come
The precedence never been a president that is more dumb
Slave to the bankers, slave to the gun lobby
There'll be permanent war, always demonize somebody
Families broke up, sanity closed shut
How can it be this man receives a salary to show up
Private jet nervous, disturb 'em with turbulence
Merging with mercenaries working to murder us
They're hurting the Earth and our urges to nurture it
We're ruled by the worst of the worst of the worst of them
Hurting the Earth and our urges to nurture it
Ruled by the worst of the worst of the worst of them

The Republican Party is the most dangerous organisation in human history
