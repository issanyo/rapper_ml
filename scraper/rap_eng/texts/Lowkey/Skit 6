I tried hard to be proud of my service, but all I could feel was shame
Racism could no longer mask the reality of the occupation
These were people, these were human beings
I've since been plagued by guilt, any time I see an elderly man
Like the one who couldn't walk, who we rolled onto a stretcher, and told the Iraqi police to take him away
I feel guilt anytime I see a mother with her children, like the one who cried hysterically
And screamed that we're worse than Saddam
As we forced her from her home
I feel guilt anytime I see a young girl
Like the one I grabbed by the arm, and dragged into the street
We were told we were fighting terrorists...
The real terrorist was me, and the real terrorism was this occupation
Racism within the military has long been an important tool to justify the destruction and occupation of another country
It has long been used to justify the killing, subjugation and torture of another people
Racism is a vital weapon employed by this government
It is a more important weapon than a rifle, a tank, a bomber, or a battleship
It is more destructive than an artillery shell, or a bunker buster, or tomahawk missile
While all those weapons are created and owned by this government
They are harmless without people willing to use them
Those who send us to war, do not have to pull the trigger, or lob a mortar round
They do not have to fight the war, they merely have to sell the war
They need a public who's willing to send their soldiers into harm's way
They need soldiers who are willing to kill and be killed, without question
They can spend millions on a single bomb
But that bomb only becomes a weapon when the ranks of the military are willing to follow orders to use it
They can send every last soldier anywhere on Earth, but there will only be a war, if soldiers are willing to fight
