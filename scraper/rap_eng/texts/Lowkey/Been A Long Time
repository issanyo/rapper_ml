Dj Snips! Lowkey!
Everybody stand up!
This is for the South!
This is for the West!
This is for the North!
And this is for the East!
Listen close...

I do this for those that got love for this music
And realise that most motherfuckers are stupid
The smart ones build, for the others to use it
But label exec's just act gutless and ruthless
Fuck you around with some rubbish excuses
And these days it's hard to find trust in producers
Cos if you don't own your own, your stuff is just useless
Fake Yankee MC's are just fun for amusement
London raised me, even though they don't want it
I'm just a young man that grows and shows promise
Still broke in both pockets, with no job
And holding low profit, but known for no soft shit
~~ is a prick, killing this art from
Silly got listeners on every prison from Brixton to Dartmoor
Thinking he's hardcore
I'm like George Bush on a mission to start war
Coz this is the last draw!
