[Hook: Lowkey]
In my lifetime I learnt life is suffering
And happiness is one thing that money doesn't bring
In my lifetime, our birth right is struggling
It must have been, but no matter what I keep the love within
In my lifetime, I've waited for days that didn't come
The battle's over, but the war isn't won
In my lifetime I'll keep fighting until there's none
You rap about things you see while I rap about things I've done

[Verse 1: Lowkey]
In my lifetime, I've been around the flipping planet
Welcome to the world though my parents didn't plan it
'86, it was my mum and dad that made me this
Just a baby, I couldn't understand the craziness
Let me take you back when, and run through my history
When Wendy didn't babysit my mum used to sing to me
In my lifetime I learnt the meaning of true love
Sometimes I feel like I've been through too much
In my lifetime, I lost battles and won some
Made many mistakes that can never be undone
Carried the same name as a doctor that delivered me
A toddler to a monster, tryna prosper in the industry
So what's your life like? Cause mines a bag of drama
I've seen scenes that Panorama's cameras are after
When I was 13 I saw a man die
Drove his car through that wall, all I could do was stand by
In my lifetime, I've shed so many tears
I've written so many rhymes over these years
By 20 I did more than most other British rappers did
I toured Europe, and spat a hundred bars to cannabis
The state of the world, got me thinking militant
But in the grand scheme my life is probably insignificant
I'll be stuck with regrets till nothing is left
Life's a bitch but I'm still tryna love her to death

[Break: Wreth 32]
In my lifetime, I don't mind if I ain't going platinum
Cause deep down I know that I made gold anthems
I ain't being no ransom
But I know they'll remember me like Samsung
In my lifetime, it's been me, no tantrum
I came on my own and I'll leave no phantom
In my lifetime, in my league I'm a champion
So when I decease they'll scream my anthem

[Verse 2: Wretch 32]
In my lifetime, I've seen everything except what I'm living to see
I'm Stevie Wonder, I'm tryna get a vision of me
In the mirror sitting where I'm predicted to be
As a winner that costs but my lyrics are free
I've seen so much over the years
It's been an uphill spiral, just getting close to the stairs
Now I've got a clean shave come over my beard
Now I've got a clean slate cause, there's no more in rears
In my lifetime, I like to grime for my chicks, and rhyme for respect
While these other rappers couldn't get in line with my steps
Inside of my head is a mind like Albert Einstein
I'm fly like a falcon outside
Just tryna get to where the outcomes outline
In take, it's about time that I ditched faith
And if it's about rhymes then I've been great
But that's the downside when your meets end
