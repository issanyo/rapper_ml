Don't believe everything you read in the papers
Don't believe people 'cos people are haters
Me, I never listen to what the media say 'cos
I won't eat the bullshit they're feeding my brain cuz
I got hate, for them faggot, fake journalists
Always gotta over-exaggerate certain shit
Then wonder why shit gets worse
If they come for me I'm taking out these dickheads first
I'm a different yute, that's why I rap differently
They monitor my blog for terrorist activity
They got cake to keep me, I'm out for a portion
I'm sick of them blowing shit out of proportion
The media is just a fourth branch of the government
They can suck themselves I won't answer to none of them
I'm taking aim and my target is the beast
Believe none of what you hear and only half of whaat you see
