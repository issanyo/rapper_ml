[Verse]
I need a ribbon, I know I'm pimpin
I'm Neva simpin, shit don't get different
I die by da g code and dats how I'm living
Da pea coat a twenty, I ran up my funds, I had to go get it, but dese busta trippin
Dey no speak cash talk, so bitch I no listen
Look at da Diamond dey dripping my neck get to glisten, my shit is da shit man, I'm ready for shipment, boy send in yo order, we do da logistic my niggas gon eat like a picnic regardless, fuk da fame I want da cash I'm jus honest, fuk it up on foreign clothes and da thotties, crazy wat a nigga do for da body, crazy wat a nigga do for sum body, my lil wardies got no prob catching bodies, cheat us out da dough we be at yos knockin, talking crazy we gon pop at ya noggin
East Atlanta I rep gutta gang proudly
We sum animals sum savages bra
Lotta niggas won't b here for da blow up
Switching up when da sun ain't shine on us
No!
