[Intro]
You might take my life
But you can't take my soul
You can't take my soul
You might take my freedom
But you can't take my soul
You can't take my soul

[Verse 1]
Whether it's a cancer patient or assassination
Or I fought for emancipation
My intentions were pure you can't debate 'em
But no, never ever shook hands with Satan
My fans are amazing, I thank and praise 'em
When I die, don't cry, just congratulations
A million more feet will stamp the pavement with plans of changes, no exaggeration
We will not be ignored
You will be rocked with the force of the bombs you dropped in those wars
I will not be bought
And I consciencely thought it was wrong, so I constantly fought
Peace is something I would really adore
But we are at war so give me a sword
I'm merely a corpse, but still be assured
When you kill me there will be a million more

[Pre-Hook-Lowkey]
Born alone and die alone
Those words ringin' inside my dome
Best friends are the pen and the microphone
Roamin' until I find my way home
Turn my body cold but my soul is mine
Take a deep breath and I close my eyes
I will go when I'm supposed to die
But in death I will multiply

[Hook-Mai Khalil]
My backs against the wall
But you can't kill us all
Even if you take my life
Still we will survive
We shall overcome
And the tables will turn
Today I die as one but as millions I'll return
But as millions I'll return
But as millions I'll return

[Verse 2]
In these critical times don't be really surprised
If I get victimised by Gideon's spies
I sympathise with that Brazilian guy
On the tube, but we're used to the hideous lie
YOur civilians die, millions cry
Our civilians die", they're militants right?
How silly am I to be figuring why?
The injustice is clear and I feel it inside
Hear me in Gaza, here me in Glasgow
Hear me in Baghdad, hear me in Plasto
Clearly they hear me from here to Chicago
Think things are all good but really they aren't though
Peace is something I would really adore
But we are at war so give me a sword
I'm merely a corpse, but still be assured
When you kill me there will be a million more

[Pre-Hook-Lowkey]

[Hook-Mai Khalil]

[Verse 3]
My people are bleedin'
So I'm readin' and seekin' the deepest of meanin's
My demons are breedin'
In my sleep I can feel it, I need to defeat 'em
My temperature's risin'
If tempted I'll rise with the temper of Tyson
Resent all the violence
Cause of people with tension
It tends to divide them
The pen that I write with
Is better than a sword when I strike with the strength of a Titan
My friends are still fighting against all the tyrants
So then why would it end when I die then?
Peace is something I would really adore
But we are at war my pen's killing your sword
I'm merely a corpse, but still be assured
When you kill me there will be a million more

[Pre-Hook-Lowkey]

[Outro]
You might take my life
But you can't take my soul
You can't take my soul
You might take my freedom
But you can't take my soul
You can't take my soul

You might take my life
But you can't take my soul
You can't take my soul
You might take my freedom
But you can't take my soul
You can't take my soul
