[Bridge]
Hit my first lick in the middle of the summer
Pullin' out the 'partment complex hopin' niggas didn't see the numbers
Pushin' on the gas tryna' make it to the hood hear the police coming
Bending them corners, I'd do it all for them commas, I'm just being honest

[Hook]
I ain't in the shit for the fame or the bitches
I ain't tryna' chill 'cause I came for the digits
Niggas always sayin' don't change for the money
Say alotta things but you ain't really for me
See a young nigga comin' up, see the bitches runnin' up, but I'm still gon' remain on point
Tryna peep game but my game on point, still keep the thang on point

[Verse]
Ever since I was like ten I was with it
I was tryna' memorize 2Pac lyrics
Gucci Mane "Black Tee" bumpin' in my spirit
If he ain't from 'round here better clear it
Purple rag hangin' on my waist like Jelly
Tryna' go ham with the cheese like the Deli
I was just young tryna' find a little paper
When I touched my first rack ain't nothin' they could tell me
Tryna' find a lick in the beast of the belly
Niggas can't stand when you breathe 'cause they jealous
We can beef if it's 'bout more cheese if they let us
Fuck around leave 'em 6 feet with the devils
We ain't finna' call police we the rebels
Long weekends no sleep gotta get up
Looking for a lick so sweet can't let up
Ain't broke no more my G get'cha bread up
Still remember days at the park just a little after dark everybody had trees they was sellin'
Hoes get exposed in a week if they let us
Hit a few times spend a week with the fellas
All black down use to creep with the 'Retta
Learned alotta shit OG was a felon
Did time on his own feet he ain't tellin'
Still might pull up on a nigga like I...

Hit my first liq in the middle of the summer

Tryna peep game but my game on point, still keep the thang on point

[Verse]
Still keep the thang ducked off with the clip
Car so big get lost in the whip
Sleepin' on the couch it was hard for the kid
But I had to make way take a lost for a win
Out there had to take what they ain't give
Nights I had to starve but I ain't trip
Niggas tried my face like I ain't shit
Bitches switchin' sides like I ain't hit
But it's okay, shit'll happen when you fall off
So now I'm on the job can't call off
So now I'm on the run for the come up when I come back I'ma shit on all y'all, Awh lord
All my niggas keep it ten toes
If a lil' nigga start reachin get low
Told 'em I been on it all season can't slow
Even if the money start leakin' can't fold cause I
Been in this shit for too long, feeling like killin' these niggas by finishin' songs
Been done with hittin' them licks, been done with scopin' out scenes and kickin' in homes
Now I'm just posted and smokin' this dope as I focus on writin' this shit from the dome
Now when I post on that corner it sorta' remind me of times when I
