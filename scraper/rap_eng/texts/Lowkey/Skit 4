You know what's interesting about this whole idea of this, this, this intolerance and this hate, and this terrorism thing, I, I noticed from the debate the other, the other day from, it wasn't the debate actually
It was this conversation he had
It was this woman who said to McCain "Obama is an Arab" (right), and he said "No no no m'am he's not an Arab"
Oh I though this is wonderful he's repudiating this kind of intolerance and hatred
He said "No no he's not an Arab, he's a good man" (right) (Laughter)
(He said he's a decent citizen)
Hold on, what if I said to you, what if someone said "I heard he is a Jew" and I said ""No no he's not a Jew, he's alright" (Laughter and Applause)
"I hear the guy's a catholic", "Catholic? No, he's a, good decent guy" (right, yeah)
Arab and good person are not antithetical as to one another (right, that's that was) (Applause)
This idea of, this prejudice that we've allowed to fester in this campaign where this, we've allowed this idea where, denying the fact that Obama, who yet is not an Arab, nor is he a Muslim, we've allowed that denial to turn into the acceptance of both of those things as a legitimate slur, is really a problem, you know what I mean? (But the irony of John Mccain)
These are slurs, these are category human beings, they are not slurs of people (Applause)
