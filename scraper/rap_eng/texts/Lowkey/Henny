Ye
This is that "its about 4am in the morning"
Its not even about "4am in the morning" it is 4am in the morning.... and we gone, ye

(Chorus)
Gone off the Henny, gone off the henny
Lately I've been going off the henny, going off the henny
Throwin out the E for my side, E for my side
Throwing out the E when we ride, E when we ride

Verse:
Ye, I've been sippin
Convoy got my niggas tippin
2 stepping but we ain't slippin
Girls work it for a nigga uh, damn I'm pimpin
So mean with it
They won't cut it, man I'm too fitted
And my niggas ice grilling mouth too chilly
Going Yaya with the tooth filling, head spinning
Off the henny in my cup lit as fuck with the seat low
Themed out, G shit, thats the sequel
Blowin out swishers like its legal
Ye, nd I'm smooth with it
Its not about what you do, its what you do with it
Bodman upon di ting, me I'm rude with it
Frank Cino murder ink, Ja I rule with it
Ye da crew winning
With dem gyals pon di basement
Alla dem know dem boy a killer, he a waste man

Gone off the Henny, gone off the henny x2

(Chorus)
Gone off the Henny, gone off the henny
Lately I've been going off the henny, going off the henny
Throwin out the E for my side, E for my side
Throwing out the E when we ride, E when we ride

(Bridge)
Henny
Lately I've been going off the henny, henny
Gone off the henny, henny
Gone off the henny, henny
Henny

(Beat Switch)

O11 mixing lean with the sodium
Slowly making way to the podium
Watch for the kid Nickelodeon
Ridin with Simone nd she od'in
In a droptop matchbox, ye the old bm

And we going off the henny, henny
Ye we going off the henny, henny
Going off the henny
