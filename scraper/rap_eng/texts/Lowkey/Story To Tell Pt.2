Remember Ricky's wife in part one? I never said her name
She was known on road as "Vanessa Fame"
When she wedded Ricky she never claimed his second name
Back when she was still acting like the jokes he cracked were funny
She was keeping it low, smoking crack with Sonny
Scheming all on her hubby's stacks of money
Before they took his cash and they dashed to Surrey
Sonny was one of Ricky's trusted friends

Back when her and Ricky still had sex but she'd just pretend
They took his funds then drove into the sunset like 'fuck the ends'
Chased by cops and jakes but got away
Besides, Vanessa's been eight weeks pregnant now
Ain't told Sonny, he's stressed out cause there's feds about
Three months, she tells him. He's overjoyed - hopes it's a boy
But you've got to feel sorry for the silly prick
'cause she never said the fetus in her womb was Ricky's kid

Four months, Vanessa feels awkward
They find a flat so she tries to act like it's all good
Settle down, in a peaceful town
But five months, she just can't suppress the guilt
Tried to slit her wrists when Sonny's out to get some milk
They put her on bare different anti-depressant pills
All that, on top of a crack habit
Ain't hard to see this baby's fate - it's all mathematics

Seven months, everything she's seen Vanessa kept it in silently
But wrote down exactly how she felt in her diary
Should have bun it when they were running from feds
But instead she hid it under the bed
Deep down she was smart but drugs had her dumb in the head
Still you could never tell that her husband was dead
She took it faster now, acting happy with a heartless smile
In writing, cursing her bastard child

As for Sonny, he was doing things he couldn't say
Almost got put away for pushing H
He didn't fuck with it but wasn't sure Vanessa could resist
Still had nightmares about her severing her wrists
Eight months comes, Sonny prays once for his baby's life
Maybe twice. By now Vanessa's stomach is unusually large
And Sonny's planning all the things they're gonna do to the yard
Oblivious to the hideously obvious

He was shottin' to some kids
While she was on a trip to the doctor's quick
He was over in Walthamstow, talking on his phone
When they called him to let him know her water's broke
And she went into labour. He got home, two hours and ten minutes later
Got the message, but decided not to stress it
In his bed, reached for his lighter and cigarettes
But dropped his lighter, as it hit the floor it rolled under the bed
He pushed the bed back. The book he found underneath, he read that page by page
Feeling like his heart was being sliced in half with a razor blade
Sonny can't believe what he finds out
Gets all reflective and high in the house
Tries brown the first time and he dies on the couch
Some say that they die when the smoking starts
But others think that Sonny really died from a broken heart

The worst thing is that Vanessa's giving birth to twins
Maybe she knew Sonny died, we never could tell
But at that moment, her heartbeat's level, it fell
A heart attack, what kind of last laugh is that?
She told the midwife "What? I'mma let my kids have it"
But her last words were "it should have been a miscarriage"
What goes around comes around seems to ring true
But this is far from the end blud: to be continued
