[Verse 1]
We were just 2 brothers 5 years apart
Back in the days when I feared the dark
In them times we did what the rest do I looked up to you
Tried hard to impress you
But I was too young to think logical
Gaining your approval was impossible
Go away that was all you were telling me then
Down the line then things between us were very intense
And I admit sometimes I'd act stupid and
It was you who introduced me to rap music
You groped my hand one time I thought you bruised it
But there was so many I times I saw you lose it
I remember mom screaming when you hit her
And in my photographic memory theres a picture
I'm on the stairs watching dad throw you out the front door
As the memories run through my head once more

[Hook x2]
Did I reach out and Hold you
Did I reach out
Did I reach out and Hold you in my arms
I'm Sorry
Did I reach out

[Verse 2]
When I was 12 and you where 18 you went away growing up
I experienced some better days got to know myself
And how to stand on my own too
I failed to grow into a man that would show you
Sometimes I wasn't around you was good for me
Cuz you showed me things a child my age I shouldn't see
Years later you came back acting the same
I refused to speak to you That was ashamed
You tried to talk to me
But I wouldn't even look at you and
You reacted in a way I thought you wouldn't do
You took me seriously But you would never change
And thats something I really believed
Then on my birthday you wrote a rhyme to me
Still when I saw you I walked past silently
You said you understood I needed room at the end you said
Peace k low see you soon
(but you didn't... you never did)

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Sorry I didn't answer your letter
I can't remember the last time we were laughing together
Sorry I told mom to not let you come around
You extended you hand
While I shut you out
I'm sorry I didn't see the love in your heart
Sorry I still held a grudge from the past
I'm listening to this beat on your cd player
I'm sorry I'm sorry you didn't see me later
I was running from issues
I didn't want to face
You were on the steps chillin with them kids on the estate
Pictures just bring me to tears
You believed that we should face all the things that we fear
Sorry I just wasted a wasted chance
Sorry I so ashamed to stop it
Sorry I didn't write back
Sorry you didn't get a ding
Sorry so sorry for everything
