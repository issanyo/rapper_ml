[Intro: Lowkey]
Yeah, Lowkey!
Straight from South-West.(Straight from South-West)
Let's Go! (Let's go!)

[Verse 1: Lowkey]
I'm from a place that, left me psychologically scarred
A lot of crime, but many guys that wanna-be stars
Mans take it easy, but a life of poverty's hard
Shit is common, like a knife 'n' robbery charge
In my life I did what the blind majority can't
Around me fiends crave for crack
And stomp your head into the pavement untill your face is flat
Talking codes on the payphone, incase it's tapped
I might make a track, but still remain gutter, till my life fades to black
Don't come around if you don't know the right way to act
Cause there's some things that you have to know first
Round here the cameras don't work
Yout'-dem don't give a fuck for another man
If you take a loss, bounce back like a rubber band
Understand pricks try to test you
This life is stressful, if your quite successful
Wolves that are quick to slash your temples
I might get a few rings and customize new kicks
Just let me do my thing, don't fuck with my music
I'm an emcee from my head to my toes
It runs in my blood, in my flesh and my bones
The pen is my best friend, I'm never depressed and alone
I'm an underground cat with a professional flow, destined to blow
Emcees need to backup and let their testicles grow
(What the fuck?)
