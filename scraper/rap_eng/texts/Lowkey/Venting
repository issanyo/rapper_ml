You can't force it
Ya can't plant it
Even though I'm your orbit
I'm still stranded
Of course this is more then
Ya standard
Situation I can't stand her
So I sit and wait for ya answer
Anticipate but I can't burst
Into tear my heart glass chamber
Not the one you use to smoke weed with
And release anger
Keep pleading the 5th and burning bridges
Ya cliff hanger
Shift changer
Give me the gist without the disclaimer
Ya bitch told me give her the dick
After I finger banged her
Cut the shit I need a razor
Or a crisp piece of paper
(the To spread the word)
To spread the word
Don't even know what is worst
To have a gift or a curse
Cause gift could be what hurts you
Having an exquisite mind
But no body spent time and heard you
But they act like heard you
Heard you bro, heard you bro
Heard you bro I heard you bro
But i ask where did your virtues go
Virtually progressing Turtle slow
What cereal without milk
Was miracles without the struggles
How can you ever be killed If you never lived up to
Ya expectations that you had in mind for ya self
That alive is what helps
You Imagine a life with wealth
Antagonizing ya cells with
The fire that had melted it
And were put to use when you felt helplessness
But I don't want fail again
If I was delicate
I would of fell and then
How I felt with in
Was like Hell and sins
Life's a bitch but ya can't teller it
Like some Hellen Keller shit
Except I'm a magician with this Pen I tell her it
With out it I'm irrelevant
Cause then I couldn't vent
Or invent these flows
To be invincible
Unpredictable
Lungs get hit with smoke
Dumb bitch get choked
Some kids is broke
And I happen to be one of them
But rich with soul
This is what meta is
Steady got my eye in the sky and my head in it
Searching for treasures that ly in mt Everest
But it be treacherous
Cause I could never get
A letter in the mail that's tells me I'm better then the veterans
Etc. etc. I jetted in my race then my coach had told me to settle in
Running from my problems straight into the deadest in
I just want to be ahead again
And be a gold medalist
Momma told me be the president
Daddy told me to be better then him
Felt like I never would win
Whether or not I win I should never give in
Keep
They not letting us in
But I wonder what's in
My color skin
To have them offend
Me And not even see what's is in me
Maybe they envy
Anything but empty
I'm filled with plenty
Of these energies that harbor Da Vinci
Pinch me I must be dreaming
And now im lucid
Loosing up ya to stiff
They loosing up ya tooth when
You act ruthless
I thought ya knew this
You should try bud or be a Buddhist
I know it's tough but trust me we could do this
It's not just guns they shooting
They shot my cousin with the lupus
They wouldn't do shit if they shot me with guns held by the guy in blue shits
But it's okay cause trust me we could do this
