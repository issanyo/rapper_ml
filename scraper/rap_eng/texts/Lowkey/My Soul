[Intro]
They say the fool thinks himself to be a wise man
But the wise man knows himself to be a fool
I say that, to say this

[Hook]
You might take my life
But you can't take my soul!
You can't take my soul!
You might take my freedom!
You can't take my soul!
[X2]

[Verse 1]
They can't use my music to advertise for Coca Cola
They can't use my music to advertise for Motorola
They can't use my music to advertise for anything
The truth, I guess that's the reason the industry won't let me in
Refuse to be a product or a brand, I'm a human
Refuse to contribute to the gangster illusion
Whether I'm number one, number two, or number three
I'm unique and there will never be another me
And there will never be another you
Be proud of who you are, don't copy what the others do
They are not superior, you are not inferior
When we realize that is gonna be hysteria
Not commercial, always controversial what my pen has written
When they listen many have risen from the mental prison
That's why you don't see my face upon the television
But every time I try to sleep I hear the devil singing

[Hook]
You might take my life
But you can't take my soul!
You can't take my soul!
You might take my freedom
But you can't take my soul!
You can't take my soul!
[X2]

[Verse 2]
They can't use my music to advertise a watch or your car
They can't use my music to advertise a drink you got at the bar
They can't use my music to advertise for anything
The truth, I guess that's the reason the industry won't let me in
My integrity is the reason I'm thinking separately
Keep your three-sixty I can do this independently
It's likely I'm quite mad (why?)
Cos I say with ease slavery gave the streets Nike's and iPad's
They don't like my rhymes, say my style is like a lecture
But I'd rather die, than smile with my oppressor
I'm an honorable student, with the facts and you're Judas
You're not Hip Hop or Grime, you're just McDonald's music
Not commercial, always controversial what my pen has written
When they listen many have risen from the mental prison
That's why you don't see my face upon the television
But every time I try to sleep I hear the devil singing

[Hook]
You might take my life
But you can't take my soul!
You can't take my soul!
You might take my freedom
But you can't take my soul!
You can't take my soul!
