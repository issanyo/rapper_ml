[Intro: Lowkey]
This one is dedicated to the suit-wearing arms dealers
To the champagne-sipping depleted uranium droppers

[Hook]
Keep your hand on your gun
Don't you trust anyone
Keep your hand on your gun
Don't you trust anyone

[Verse 1: Lowkey]
First in my scope is BAE Systems
Specialize in killing people from a distance
Power is a drug and they feed the addiction
Immediate deletion of people's existence
Who says what is and what isn't legitimate resistance
To push these buttons you don't need a brave heart
State of the art darts leave more than your face scarred
You might impress an A&R with your fake bars
'Cause you probably think Rolls Royce only make cars
This is for the colonizers turned bomb-providers
Take this beef all the way back to Oppenheimer
They call it warfare but your wars aren't fair
If they were there'd be suicide bombers in Arms Fairs
Scam for the funds, they will mangle your son
If you try to speak out they will stamp on your tongue
To your land they will come till you stand up as one
It's begun

[Hook]
Keep your hand on your gun
Don't you trust anyone
Keep your hand on your gun
Don't you trust anyone

[Verse 2: Lowkey]
Next in my scope is Lockheed Martin
They will tell you when the bombs need blastin'
Don't think, just listen to the songs, keep dancin'
Do they really want us to have our own brains
Who do you think is really running Guantanamo Bay
And it might be sensitive but I'll mention it
Who do you think has got us filling out the censuses
Who do you think is handing out the sentences
This ain't the BBC so there's no censorship
Heard of many mercenaries gettin' with the clever pimp
Not a gun seller but none's better than Erik Prince
Make money off many things, mainly it's crime
This one is dedicated to the Raytheon 9
Scam for the funds, they will mangle your son
If you try to speak out they will stamp on your tongue
To your land they will come till you stand up as one
It's begun

[Hook]
Keep your hand on your gun
Don't you trust anyone
Keep your hand on your gun
Don't you trust anyone
