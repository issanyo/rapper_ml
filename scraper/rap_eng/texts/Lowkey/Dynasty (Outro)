[Intro: Emilio Rojas]
Sometimes you gotta let people know where you been
So they can appreciate where you at

[Verse 1: Emilio Rojas]
Growin' up, I seen a lot of things go crazy though
Product of the 80’s though, mama played Madonna
While my father played Willie Colon
When I was seven, he left us, that’s when he fled our home
Ain’t give my mama nothin', not a cent to help her feed or clothe
And we were cold as hell, everybody broke as well
The market saturated, couldn’t give away a soul for sale
Your choice was go to jail or go to school and go in debt
Or work a nine to five and live the rest of your life with no respect
Some of us done went to early graves or early funerals
Sad it happened but it’s sadder that it ain’t unusual
Selling drugs or usin' ‘em, my cousin was abusin' ‘em
He tryna rehabilitate, he saw what they was doing to him
I got a girl I’m livin' with because I love her
But her family hate my ass, her mama tryna break us up
And her father got the monster, no one even knows what stage it’s in
But if you poor and a minority, you can’t get AIDS and live
And she just take it in, carryin' the weight of it
And she don’t shed a tear, I never seen such an amazin' chick
I wanna give the world to her but can’t because the space I’m in
Somewhere in between unknown and blowin' out the frame of this
Showin' y’all the way it is, showin' y’all the way we live
Showin' y’all the truth behind the bullshit they place us in
And I was lost but now I finally found my way again
I’m ready for the fight of my life, it’s time to weigh me in

[Hook: Gene Noble & Emilio Rojas]
So much more than just what meets the eye
(Now I just wanna build a dynasty)
We’re on our way somewhere up in the sky
(Now I just wanna build a dynasty)
And it’s so big that even when we die
(Now I just wanna build a dynasty)
We’re gonna be a dynasty, we gotta be a dyntasy
(Now I just wanna build a dynasty)

[Verse 2: Emilio Rojas]
And this for all my people tryna eat
I done grown so much, I’m everythin' that I was tryna be
Used to think they cats was out to get me
I was blind to see that people wasn’t usin' me
They really just relied on me
When homie first reached out to me, I thought I hit the lottery
I’m standin' in them BET Awards like they gon’ ride for me
Yeah, I was finally part of a team, in the city that never sleeps
Now I find it’s harder to dream, ain’t no rest
Up with anxiety all inside of me, sirens passin' me by
In the city where all the violence be (brrrrrraaatttt)
Ain’t no economy here ‘cause there’s only poverty
Section 8 apartments but we dressin' in the finer things
She got her mother’s figure, never knew her father figure
Now she strip for figures, her father could be the guy that tip her
They on the block again, puttin' kids through college
And drug money turnin' ‘em toxic instead of scholarships
But I don’t play the politics, I don’t think I’m even votin'
Obama probably in pocket with all them CEOs
And y’all could live for the moment, I’m livin' for the future
I got some sins to atone ‘cause I put some women through hurt
And what’s a king if the throne has been sittin' in manure?
And what is livin' if you just livin' for gettin' through it?
It’s gon’ be different for any kid that I bring into it
I don’t see the sky as the limit to it ‘cause I’mma build a dynasty

[Hook: Gene Noble & Emilio Rojas]
So much more than just what meets the eye
(Now I just wanna build a dynasty)
We’re on our way somewhere up in the sky
(Now I just wanna build a dynasty)
And it’s so big that even when we die
(Now I just wanna build a dynasty)
We’re gonna be a dynasty, we gotta be a dyntasy
(Now I just wanna build a dynasty)
So much more than just what meets the eye
We’re on our way somewhere up in the sky
And it’s so big that even when we die
We’re gonna be a dynasty, we gotta be a dyntasy
