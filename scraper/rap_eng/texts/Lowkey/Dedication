Listen...yeah

Human lives more precious than gold
When children die their souls are left to haunt the rest of the globe
Then the weather gets cold feel'em in the wind whenever it blows
When it rains God cries cuz now the devil is involved
They raise hell which means more weapons
They get obese while a child dies from hunger ever four seconds
That's why I got no respect for what your reppin
Another nation we've equalled power got you all threatened
While you worry about your career
The government sit and worrying about north Korea
The world is in a messed-up state and it's more than clear
That we got more than enough clean water here
I'm just doing what I can to help right these wrongs
After this tune is finished though the fight goes on
It took about twenty minutes just to write this song
When it's done I wonder how many more lives are gone

This one’s for Kosovo, Iraq, Palestine, Chechnya
All those who passed on 9/11 in America
Afghanistan, Kashmir, Bosnia and Darfur
It's in our nature as the human nature to start wars
Congo, Somalia, Eretria, Rwanda
Lebanon, Liberia, Serbia and Uganda
Around the world to many child deaded in vain
I won't carry on cuz there's too many to name

Yea I know your ends are sown up
But I know a girl from Kosovo that witnessed her best friends get blown up
Where I live these little these chicks pretend their grown ups
They got abused young so most men they don't trust
Bush or Hussein who's crazier?
Who's sane who's evil who is the true saviour?
Here the children are spoiled and move lazier
While child prostitution is rising in Romania
Tell me true who really cares?
When slavery put on our feet the very shoes that we wear
You don't care if it's strangers they killing
You don't care that the soldiers that go there are rapping the women
Don't lie when your soul dies is wealth enough?
Hells in us the world's submitted to be Beelzebub
We won’t help ourselves and no one’s helping us
It's only a matter of time before we self-destruct

This ones for Kosovo, Iraq, Palestine, Chechnya
All those who passed on 9/11 in America
Afghanistan, Kashmir, Bosnia and Darfur
It's in our nature as the human nature to start wars
Congo, Somalia, Eretria, Rwanda
Lebanon, Liberia, Serbia and Uganda
Around the world to many child deaded in vain
I won't carry on cuz there's too many to name

Yo, fam the cycle is vicious
Governments compare the value of human life likes there's a difference
What’s really guiding us science or religion?
They say war is a last resort their lying it's a tradition
There so much pain in my eyes, but I don't cry
It's like my heart just froze up in these cold times
They start the civil wars then go, but I know why
Cuz It’s westerners that supply the weapons for both sides
You think my words should have got me killed they probably will
There in Afghanistan to profit off the poppy fields
Where is the love I'm not sure these days?
Everyone knows for years they've had the cure for AIDS
And in Palestine suicide bombers avenge their relatives
I'm not saying It's something that's justified cuz It never is
But you have to remember what Nelson Mandela did
Before he became the president, he was a terrorist

This ones for Kosovo, Iraq, Palestine, Chechnya
All those who past on 9/11 in America
Afghanistan, Kashmir, Bosnia and Darfur
It's in our nature as the human nature to start wars
Congo, Somalia, Eretria, Rwanda
Lebanon, Liberia, Serbia and Uganda
Around the world to many child deaded in vain
I won't carry on cuz there's too many to name (x2)
