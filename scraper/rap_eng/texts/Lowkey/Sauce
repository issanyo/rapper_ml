Too much sauce I got mustard
If I see that girl ya boy lustin'

If you send that beat I might bust it
Too much sauce I got mustard

Runnin' like Usain bolt with no exits
Flippin' like hunnid tracks with no effort
The old lab was good but I left it
Boy only real niggas in my section
Burn cities finest we the bestest

Young Niggas with the sauce
Coming up from the bottom
We was chillin' on the South Side
But now we heading to the North
Young Niggas with the sauce

Bars breaking every wall that's in front of me
So much dayum fuckin' sauce that I'll flood the sea
On top of the charts where I'm gonna be
So come FUCK with me

[Verse 4: Michael Wang]
Man the sauce so lit so I salute the fakes
So I say fuck you snakes again I have to say
I go brazy crazy on my grind for fact
Homie I can't go sleep
My mind is counting stacks so I stay focus
Money, money coming closer

I see butlers with the henny my nigga
They offer dubies with oj we saucin'
