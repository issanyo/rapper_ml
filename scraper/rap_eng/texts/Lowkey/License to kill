Verse1:
In any society Police are very necessary
But is it necessary to leave us in cemetery’s
Look at the victims dead and buried because there’s very many
What is the sentences there getting? Is there ever any?
What will take to get the public up in arms?
They pull out the truncheon and thats when the trouble starts
3rd of Jan 09, Riot Masks come and charge
Ambush kids and women in the Hyde Park underpass
How could you justify the figures when you count them all?
We come out to protest? Do you just come out to brawl?
Cowards and fools protect a system which is bound to fall
Bountiful evidence, still no one held accountable
Golden Eye know your rights cos it’s real
This is real life, they won’t treat you like in The Bill
This one’s for every innocent that died in field
Tell me who really gave them the License To Kill?

Hook
Cuz they will search you, and they will cuff you
And they will curse you, and they choke you
And they will beat you, and they will hurt you
They batter your body black, blue, brown and purple
But who gave them the license to kill
When I say we want you say justice
We want Justice 6x

Verse2:
First Menezes got killed, then Dick got promoted
Then Hip Hop’s lip’s locked and did what they told it
No one even said a bar
A whole chain of command responsible and not one person was ever charged
It’s like we stood back, All closed our eyes
'cuz If you’ve got a badge the laws don’t apply
They tell us be patient, For justice we keep waiting
Chris Alder died on the floor of a Police Station
And not one person convicted in eleven years
But it was very clear, the footage was everywhere
I'm not intimidated
This is for families that lost loved ones and never saw the killers faces
Golden Eye know your rights cos it’s real
This is real life, they won’t treat you like in The Bill
This one’s for every innocent that died in field
Tell me who really gave them the License To Kill

Hook

Verse3:
I can’t understand coppers
Who attack a man with his back to them, and his hands in his pockets
You can’t disregard the facts
They rushed the post mortem, at first tried to claim it was a heart attack
Not a protestor, just a working person leaving
Second post mortem? cause of death, internal bleeding
It's just manslaughter captured camcorder
Imagine that was your grandson or granddaughter
NEVER think we’ve forgotten them
ALL the brown and black victims treated just like Ian Tomlinson
It’s something that bothers me
So stuff your apology
Two things we ask for, justice and equality
Golden Eye know your rights cos it’s real
This is real life, they won’t treat you like in The Bill
This one’s for every innocent that died in field
Tell me who really gave them the License To Kill

Hook
