[Chorus] x2
I see freedom around the corner, love, peace and laughter
Victory's amongst us, so I smile through this disaster
After a life as a traveller, when I reach my hereafter
I pray the doors open, reward for these words I've spoken

[Verse 1]
There's a war going on outside
You can run but you can't hide
You can stand here in your suit and ties
And live life blind, in all good time
Imma see that smile where the sun don't shine
Imma die a coming one more time
So I can die again in the same frame of mind
If this is a crime, label me a serial criminal
For the rest of my life, black and white
Good against evil, it's as simple as wrong against right
And I'm standing on the right side, waiting in line
For my time, uwo wo woah
I stand up for what I believe in
As long as I'm still breathing
And I fall down on my face this evening
Like it's the last prayer I'm leading
I turn my back on my own wife and children
If they were bad for my religion
? x3

[Chorus] x2
I see freedom around the corner, love, peace and laughter
Victory's amongst us, so I smile through this disaster
After a life as a traveller, when I reach my hereafter
I pray the doors open, reward for these words I've spoken
