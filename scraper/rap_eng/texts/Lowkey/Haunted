[Hook: Mai Khalil]
I can feel you here, watchin' me
Whispers that I hear are haunting me
I can feel you here, watchin' me
Whispers that I hear are haunting me
Feel it in the air

[Verse 1:]
My brother died when I was 18
Now I'm 24 and I keep having the same dream
My days seem to past fast, but now I hate sleep
So when they say stay free I really know what they mean
Just remember I was destined to fail
At every level they tell you the rebels will never prevail
Heaven or hell, whatever the weather, you never can tell
You know you've lost a loved one when you remember their smell
I was born to fight oppression, but I'm traumatized and stressin'
With this borderline depression I swear I'm haunted by your presence
You get all of my confessions, pray the Lord provides His blessing
And I soar as high as heaven but it's sort of like I'm guessing
Cause I'm older than you were when you died, I'm nervous inside
In the afterlife, are you the age you were when you died?
It's puzzling me, that would be something to see
Face-to-face with an older brother that's younger than me
I'm still haunted...

[Hook: Mai Khalil]
I can feel you here, watchin' me
Whispers that I hear are haunting me
I can feel you here, watchin' me
Whispers that I hear are haunting me
Feel it in the air

[Verse 2:]
When I was 18 my older brother killed himself
Now I'm 24 and I'm sittin' in this flipping cell
No comment why they raid my home, I'm waitin' to be given bail
Wish me well, don't know where I'm headed, I hope it isn't jail
It's a strange feelin' when your face is on the news
And they try to twist your lyrics, claim it's hatred for the Jews
Everybody's waitin' to assume, debatin' all your views
When they would do the same if they were in your shoes
It's like barristers, court cases, solicitors and law suits
Prayin' for my freedom while I'm sittin' in the court room
I am just a simple man spittin' these ideas
But the CPS fantasize about givin' me 5 years
Til the day they release my spirit and it's peaceful
Digest the words in every lyric that I leave you
A true leader knows, it's the citizens that leads you
When I go, just know, that I did it for the people

[Hook: Mai Khalil]
I can feel you here, watchin' me
Whispers that I hear are haunting me
I can feel you here, watchin' me
Whispers that I hear are haunting me
Feel it in the air
