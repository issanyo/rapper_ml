[Hook]
Walking on this air meet me right beneath the clouds
Girl I'm in a daze there ain't never been a doubt
Talkin' on the phone 'til the sun goes down
Tell me baby girl do you love me now?

[Verse 1]
It's a cold world, Louis prince no jheri curl
I'm eatin miso soup with my Teriyaki girl
Not one to stipulate, I swear she down for anything
Lets make a movie girl, you could be my Lisa Ann
Straight to DVD, charging up my PSP
I'm playin' with your heart now save it to my memory
Polo everything, hulu plus and Hennessy
I'm watching Sailor Moon, catch me out in Waikiki

Talkin' all of this shit
Poppin' off at the hip
Said you like to party girl? Then hop up in my whip
Work it down to the tip
Bring it back while I sip
All in my emotions but she love the way I hit

Throw it down, 20 rounds, on my senpai shit
Be my Princess Bubblegum, I could be your Jake and Finn
Reading fakku gettin gully off this doujshini
I'm out in Maui bay, straight up out an anime
So risque, girl now twerk it like Beyonce
My Matsumoto-san, I'm textin you some ecchi things
Shawty 1st first class, I cannot control myself
I think about ya girl
I think about ya, no one else
