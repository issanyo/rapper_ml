[Charlie Chaplin]
The hate of men will pass, and dictators die, and the power they took from the people will return to the people. And so long as men die, liberty will never perish

[Verse 1]
Is it just a dream? Am I a fool for trying?
I stand defiant but my enemy's the tallest giant
Will my visions be reality? They tell me never
I wanna feel the unity that Malcolm felt in Mecca
I wonder if it made sense in his last moments
People don't value the soul cause they can't hold it
Find something real beyond death and misery
And understand the present in the context of history
It's been established Sykes-Picot was a bitter marriage
Since the day Thomas Edward Lawrence tricked the Arabs
Please be loyal till we're deep in soil
You can ask Mosaddegh about BP Oil
This is a battle that many better men have died fighting
But I hope to give an insight through my writing
My pen fires at the men who defend liars
I send fire till the end of your empire

[Hook: Sanasino]
We will fight to live
We will not give up
We will not give in
We will rise

And through the blood and tears
We will not give up
We will not give in
We will rise

[Verse 2]
Guess who's back, descendant of the occupied
I represent the sentiments of many men you've colonized
The President is eloquent but he's never been on my side
Melanin's irrelevant cause everything was prophecised
There was a time when they talked about the Arab Nation
Broke our good leaders, the royal map was a fabrication
Took your Keffiyeh and changed it to a fashion statement
You sat with Satan, Camp David means assassination
Peace in your imagination, that's not real
I've been where Arafat got poisoned and Sadat got killed
I'm not a martyr, just a man without a Masters
Or a master runaway slave, it's freedom I am after
This is a battle that many better men have died fighting
But I hope to give an insight through my writing
My pen fires at the men who defend liars
I send fire till the end of your empire

[Hook: Sanasino]

[Sanasino]
Like Zajel, the peaceful dove of Palestine
I will fly, I will rise
Far beyond the seventh sky
I will break free, and soar through the lies
Seeking truth, seeking the justice that is mine
The justice that is mine
I will stand, I will climb
I will spread my wings
Elevate and rise
I will rise, I will rise
We will rise
