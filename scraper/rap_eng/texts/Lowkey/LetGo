Intro:
"Hey Retta, uhm, it's me, uhm, I've been trying to call you and I just keep getting your voicemail...why don't you wanna talk to me? I really miss you and I really wanna talk to you...please call me back."

Chorus: JRetta
I'm not the guy that she should be with
She don't wanna let go
She knows that I'm a cheater
She don't wanna let go
They told her I'm a player
But she already know
I told her I can't stay here
She don't wanna let go

She, she, she, she, she don't wanna let go
She, she, she, she, she don't wanna let go
She, she, she, she, she don't wanna let go
She, she, she, she, she don't wanna let go

Verse:
Your mother warned you, your father told you, why aren't you listening?
Your friends informed you, of all my stories, my messy history
You said you know this, but you'll ignore it, you stayed persistent
You said you're for it, I tried to forfeit, 'cause I'm against it
See you're a good girl, untouched, that what makes it worse
And i'm a loner who likes to fuck, doesn't go to church
And you're a virgin who goes to school with a lot of perks
Somehow even though it's a job you say we'll make it work
What a curse...
Let me go I ask again
I don't wanna be the reason you're looking to numb the pain
I don't wanna be the reason you're hiding tears in the rain
'Cause I'm a player, and I know you not ready for all these games
Let me go...

Chorus: JRetta
I'm not the guy that she should be with
She don't wanna let go
She knows that I'm a cheater
She don't wanna let go
They told her I'm a player
But she already know
I told her I can't stay here
She don't wanna let go

She, she, she, she, she don't wanna let go
She, she, she, she, she don't wanna let go
She, she, she, she, she don't wanna let go
She, she, she, she, she don't wanna let go

Verse: JRetta
I'm kind of nervous, all the promises I made you were so empty
And you heard this, that I'll pass on you when I feel that it's failing, and...
Further down the line you'll start to realise I was faking
When I'm a prisoner to your love, I'll want out, you'll see me bailing like...

Chorus: JRetta
I'm not the guy that she should be with
She don't wanna let go
She knows that I'm a cheater
She don't wanna let go
They told her I'm a player
But she already know
I told her I can't stay here
She don't wanna let go

She, she, she, she, she don't wanna let go
She, she, she, she, she don't wanna let go
She, she, she, she, she don't wanna let go
She, she, she, she, she don't wanna let go

Verse: JRetta
I'm kind of nervous, all the promises I made you were so empty
And you heard this, that I'll pass on you when I feel that it's failing, and...
Further down the line you'll start to realise I was faking
When I'm a prisoner to your love, I'll want out, you'll see me bailing like...
Listen, I just feel something's different
You don't see it, but my eyes stay open when we kissing
I don't feel it, and you think I'm kidding, but I mean it
I'm tryna find the words to tell you, girl, let's just leave it
It's not meant to be
Let go of me
And I just hope you see
You need to let go of me
Let go of me...
