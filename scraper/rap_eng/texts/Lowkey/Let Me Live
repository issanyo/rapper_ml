This is for those who died on the 7th of July, passed tragically
And the many more that are gettin' killed in Iraq as we speak
Our bombs that we taxpayers are paying for
Everyday we're slaying more, you're wrong saying we ain't at war
56 losses that's what the telly just said
In Iraq, they'll never tell us how many are dead
And in the event that's up to our government
They don't show the numbers, (Why?) 'cos the public can't stomach it
How can you represent truth & freedom
When you're pillaging and killing innocent human beings
That is something Iraqi youths are used to seeing
So tell me truly, what do you believe in?
They've been telling us lies for years, still we wanna listen
The public got a shield for the guilty politician
Now at the end of the day, why are they sharing their views?
'cos I never seen The Queen or Tony Blair on the Tube

[Hook]
Let me live my life
Without your prejudice
Why am I getting frisked, I'm not a terrorist
Let me live my life
Evidence is irrelevant 'cos we're a threat, the feds are getting rid of it
Ever since September 11 they've been obsessed with it, oppression is what their weapon is
Let me live my life
Forget arrest on the spot, death sentences, leave my people alone, just let them live

These days we can't even bop through Oxford Circus
Without pointless coppers trying to stop and search us
What's the purpose, why you wanna bother me?
Increase security? Pff, tell them to fix up their foreign policy
I can't even sit on the Tube with my Walkman
And listen to tunes without them getting suspicious and rude
Watching closely at the things that I do
Why are you so interested bitch, I'm probably more British than you
Gotta talk safe on the phone, for years I had the same digits
With jakes try to take you to court for a train ticket
Don't argue, just listen instead
ID Card a step closer to a chip in your head
There's a bomb scare
They ask me, what, where and who, why?
It's not fair
How many muslims have blonde hair and blue eyes
So think twice
About who you try to bother
You're just as likely to be that suicide bomber

[Hook]

Police shot an innocent man, five times in the head
No militant plan, just died 'cos he ran crying and fled
Do they really want us to riot and ride on these feds?
Yeah maybe violence will have the desired effect
The other day a man got shot on the Tube, it's ill
If you were his fam, imagine how you would feel
On the news, you never see the truth revealed
Face it, the truth is them Muslim racists shoot to kill
It's all gone wild, they got us locked down in compounds
Evidence is not found, no trial, this needs to stop now
And they got the nerve to say we're hostile
Forget crackhouses, they're raiding Mosques now
I wish I could say that the future's bright
But it's not and I can't so I choose to fight
What have you got in your heart blud, you decide
'cos everyday they're abusing our human rights

[Hook]
