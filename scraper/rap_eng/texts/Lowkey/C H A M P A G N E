[Intro: Tracy Statik]

My Brain is my shit
And a lot of times man, I just really do what the fuck I feel
And the shit just come out hot you know what I mean?
( Love the way i shine, in the fucking night, all across my city boy I feel like the black knight, alright ,alright, tell me that’s alright)
But everytime you know I sit down, I put my time in
Nigga i’m trying to take off
I ain’t trying to come back nigga

[Verse 1: Tracy Statik]

I moved along to find better things
But the better things stayed away from me
I’m thankful for all that I’ve got
I never say thank you, complaining a lot
This is my opportunity
Let me make it up
Blowing out the candles
Like you did around this time on your birthday
When I wasn’t present
Still i got a gift
But you wanted me there
Standing there in person

[Hook: Tracy Statik]

Now I’m surrounded by love
Proposing a toast
We do the most
Designer & Dro
Momma had a son
Love you to the moon
We’re all superstars
We’re coming home soon

[Verse 2:  Tracy Statik]

And what are we really celebrating when we stepping out (shit)
Secretly I love your frequency
Not a blood but she’s been on my “B”
Frequently she taps into my brain
I got the 4 across my back like Redick
Crazy how my city let em’ ride
From the home of the 4’s on your motherfucking ride
Ay, Tell me can we get away
We can go real far away right now

[Hook: Tracy Statik]

[Verse 3: Tracy Statik]

I be blowing up cause a nigga young as fuck
They don’t want to fuck with me because they know i got it
I’m a fucking addict man this shit stored in the addict
We all started off in pussy cut that hard shit out
This should be the outdo but she love it in the middle
My dawgs hotter than McGriddles
They be hanging out the window
The perfect scene to me would be so chill & serene
Do to all this shrubbery
Power puffs make it bubbly
Like buttercup she love it rough
She blossomed to a woman
We can go real far away right now
Bitch I’m out of the solar
I’m gonna miss the ones that raised me
I just gotta stay strong
I find comfort when that paraphernalia’s
Ripped in the bong
I did this all night long
I do this for my dawgs
Let’s fuck up commas
I get robotnic
I’m from futurama
Sorry mama never meant to hurt you
Had to teach your ass a lesson
Still your little blessing
Lord you know I fucked up
God damn you know I’m fucked up

[Outro: Tracy Statik]
We can go real far away right now
Tell me what you want to do
It ain’t no phones on
Just me & you zoning out
Reminiscing bout the shit we been through
Made it out
I been on my own since day 1 girl
Had more one night stands in the last 5 years
Than a motherfucker been to church
Damn that there shit so real
That’s why she feeling the way that she do
Alright, alright, alright
(Trace Statik you gone, boy Trace static you on, boy Trace Statik you on, No phones on it’s you zoned out, yeah yeah)
