Verse: Sebby OG

Coolin with sauce and we rollin that killa
Red leather jacket like thrilla
Dont need no man in the middle
We handle that business
Family thang we make a killin
I am so austin powers widdit widdit
Groovy baby, choosey lady
Beat the booty then i be skating
I be ducking my location
Working hard being patient
Marijuana licensed patient
Triggeration statiom, mitchy slick
I rep the town that im livin in
Puttin my life in these sentences
Catch you slippin catch a sentence
Catch me cruisin gettin lifted
Oh!
She say that she love my aroma
Smoke with her turned to a stoner
I gave her that game that she soaked in
Took it then put it in motion
Took a lil sip of that potion
Feel like i dove in the ocean
We got the juice and she know it
Spazzin on stage with the homies
Im a daygo player like Kellen Winslow
Blowin heavy indo
Keep in confidential
I ain't spillin info
You dont get no intel
So dont bleep my nextel

Chorus:

I just wanna smoke my weed, roll my blunt yuh
I just wanna roll my weed, whatchu want ? yuh
I just wanna stuff my raw, roll a cone yeah
Raw$ pull up he got that O, dont blow my phone
Yeah yeah yeah

Verse: Raw$

You ran with the wolves
Now you gon run with the packs
I pull up outside of my shows
I dont even say nothin back
I pull up hop out of the rover
She say she like my persona
I coulda got head with no shoulders
Id leave it dead like a soldier
Oh do thang
Oh oh do that thang
We keep it pushin for miles
Yall are still choosin ya lanes
She did everything that i told her
She hit my cone hit my doja
She hit everything that i rolled her
Workin on her like a quota
Water sippin never water whippin
If i ball i win it swishin
If i got it then you know i bought it
Its alot of fraudin
So you know i dont stop to listen
With my homies
We pull up in a van
Killin shows and i dont know where they at
Im just posted w the brodies in fact
This bitch blowin my phone
I ain't blowin it back

Bridge:

Play this for your bitch when i roll by
Put a price on your head if he told lies
She gimme dome gimme dome while im so high
Play this for your bitch when i roll by

Chorus:

I just wanna smoke my weed, roll my blunt yuh
I just wanna roll my weed, whatchu want ? yuh
I just wanna stuff my raw, roll a cone yeah
Raw$ pull up he got that O, dont blow my phone
