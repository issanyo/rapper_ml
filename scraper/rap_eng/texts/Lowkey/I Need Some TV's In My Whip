[Intro]
(Phone Conversation)
Yuh (5x)
Yuh (4x)
Uh Lowkey

[Verse 1]
I just bought a pistol with 30 rounds and that clip aye
My crew smoking extendos we get right out the zip aye
8tracks on the groupies jacuzzis inside the VIP aye
8tracks everyday 'till there's TV's inside my whip yuh
Yuh (5x)
Pull up to the function with tooleys and pull the skeet down
Why you acting booshie I load your homie with 3 rounds
Fetty Wap my Glock but the shawty can help you see now
Pull the strap on pussies the tooley about to skeet now
Balenciaga wearin'
I got some hoes in Paris
I pull up in the LOF Ferrari all the hoes is staring
And I ain't her parent
But she call me daddy
Waking up with random hoes blame it on the Xany
Chillin' in Miami
That's a bit ironic
You can hit my homie line if you need the chronic
Ferragamo belt
Hold my jeans up
Keep the Lean cup
Keep the-
Uh yeah

[Verse 2]
Holding my nuts and I don't give a fuck
And if shawty come over she giving me suck
And I roll up the pack when it's fresh out the zip
And I smoke the whole spliff 'till I'm real off the shits
I got broads in New York I don't fuck with you dorks
And lil' shawty got neck and her hands giving torch
And I'm hitting the block and I'm putting in work
And a youngin' been thuggin' right off of his porch
Gah'damn

[Bridge]
(It's fuckin' hot in here)
Yuh (5x)
I just bought a pistol with 30 rounds and that clip aye
My crew smoking extendos we get right out the zip aye
8tracks on the groupies jacuzzis inside the VIP aye
8tracks everyday 'till there's TV's inside my whip

[Hook]
I need some TV's in my whip (8x)
Whoa
Aye

[Verse 3]
Shawty wanna' give me neck
But you know I sent her home
She telling me she love me
Got crazy ideas in her dome
I don't mess with thotties
They taunting and I'm too Indigo
Trying to wreck me steady making records like I'm Interscope
Whip flip it in the chamber aye
I been ballin' like I'm Chamberlain
I hit right then she sang for me
Now she in love with my dang-a-lang
How much do I gotta slang today
Wonder where I gotta bang today
Praying God take the pain away

[Outro]
Aye
I don't fuck with the Feds
Fuck what you 'talm 'bout
A&T the Presses [?] couldn't even help me calm down
Trying to make some guap so I can help my Dad and Mom out
And I done lost everything so I can't take a loss now
Uggh bitch
Aloe
Uh Lowkey

[End]
