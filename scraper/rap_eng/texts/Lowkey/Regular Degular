[Chorus]
I am not your regular or degular
I am just so extracurricular
I will not get off into particulars
I just copped a coupe, that bitch ridiculous
I am not your regular or degular
I am just so extracurricular
I will not get off into particular
I just copped a coupe, that bitch ridiculous

[Verse 1]
Oochie coochie, juicy Tropicana, yah
Who be looking bougie in Gabbana? Moi
Which one of y'all selling them bananas, huh?
Sweep the Playoffs ‘cause who needs a janitor?
They ask me when I knew I wasn't regular
I tell ‘em that the coupe do not take regular
Plus all my dogs is with me like Cruella, yah
Get these bitches some bread because they jelly, yah

[Refrain 1]
Thick in the thighs
Wet as the ocean, he fixin’ to dive
This is the prize
Road to the riches because of my drive
Up in the skies
I am so famous, I need a disguise
Cuttin’ some ties
That’s word to Kendrick, they killin’ my vibe!

[Pre-Chorus]
Th-thicka ah, thicka ah, ain't regular
Don’t even ah, even talk on my cellular
I’m still a yah, you a nah, you a regular
I am a star, where you start? In my belly, yah

[Chorus]
I am not your regular or degular
I am just so extracurricular
I will not get off into particulars
I just copped a coupe, that bitch ridiculous
I am not your regular or degular
I am just so extracurricular
I will not get off into particular
I just copped a coupe, that bitch ridiculous

[Verse 2]
.45 on my table, I’m a killer, yah
Where is Elvis Presley? I’m Priscilla, yah
‘Bout to cop some dope from my drug dealer, yah
Then, I’m ‘bout to crush it like Godzilla, yah
Is this how people act when you not regular?
They screamin’ from Africa to Australia
I told ‘em that I’ve always been peculiar
Queenin’ down to the letter, as in Julius

[Refrain 2]
Thick in the thighs
Thin in the waist, I be catching them eyes
Look at the ice
Whippin’ that work, I be flippin’ them pies
Flippin’ them pies
Givin’ him work whenever he applies
Look at the size, supersi-ize, I ain’t talkin’ the fries

[Pre-Chorus]
Th-thicka ah, thicka ah, ain't regular
Don’t even ah, even talk on my cellular
I’m still a yah, you a nah, you a regular
I am a star, where you start? In my belly, yah

[Chorus]
I am not your regular or degular
I am just so extracurricular
I will not get off into particulars
I just copped a coupe, that bitch ridiculous
I am not your regular or degular (Aye!)
I am just so extracurricular (Aye!)
I will not get off into particular (Wait!)
I just copped a coupe, that bitch ridiculous (Skate!)
