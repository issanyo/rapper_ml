Mmm Lowkey

[Verse 1]
Yeah you know I did it for the turn up
(Turn up turn up turn up turn up)
Did it so no fake turn up
Okay I'm coolin', I'm boolin
While they schoolin', make learners
I make it cool to go murder
Fake shit out here is unheard of
Im still FAR Party man
But I'm takin' shit further
I'll go and be a goat and all you sheep meet your herder
I go ahead and skeet and make ya bitch lick my curd up
Okay I'm tryna go stir up
All these fucks who deferred us
I tell ya bitch "Go 'head, go 'head, go 'head drop it low"
She do it like pro, know she been here since before

'Bout to fuck the whole block up
Ask them "Where the birds at? Tell em bring the whole flock up"

So I make it lit like I'm Flocka
Do it like El Chapo, free my mans when he locked up
Tell the man to sound blockas
If they tryna block us
Never been blocked before (No!)
Fuck 'em tryna stop us
And stalk us, tryna get on this guest list
Well fuck 'em (Fuck 'em, man, and)
Hand the waitress this check list, like
