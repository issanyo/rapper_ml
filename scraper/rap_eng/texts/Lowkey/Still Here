[Intro]
They told me that I fell off
But I'm still here
Aye, but I'm still here (2x)
They told me that I fell off

[Verse 1]
Man they forgot about Michael
I am the city's revival
Come alive in the nightfall
Man a nigga so spiteful
I ain't been reading my bible
Now my dad is a rival
But that's just how it goes
When niggas be switching their roles
Man I'm fighting for my soul
Forgot about all of my goals
I know I've been losing control
God is always on patrol
Shawty always on the pole
Healing is a long road
Time to let it all go
Now I'm back up in the mode
Aye, man I took me a break
All this love and the hate
I've been losing my ways
All this time that I waste
Niggas is all in my face
I see as they copy and paste
My memory's never erased
The voice had me on delay
Shawty had me on a daze
Lorain had me on a phase
All my past really weighs
Gotta live another day
Blasé, blasé, blasé, blasé
Niggas know how I be rocking
Imma get it, ain't no option (2x)

[Hook]
They told me that I fell off, ooo (2x)
They told me that I fell off (told me that I fell off)
But I'm still here
Aye, but I'm still here (2x)
Yeah, they told me that I fell off (they told me that I fell off)
But I'm still here

[Outro]
Michael where you been?
