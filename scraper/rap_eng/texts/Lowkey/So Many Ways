[Intro]​​

Yeah
Its like so many ways that I can flip it
Better know that man I’m so different
Hold on young nigga might just go kick it
But you know the young nigga just be living
Man I feel so vivid
Aye
Man I feel so vivid, Aye
Man I feel like I’m living, Aye
Nigga pass it to trey, Aye

[Verse 1]

Nigga don’t smoke, but I’m high off life
Pearling it, so just pass me the light
Shining the brightest when it is the night
Niggas be hating but that is all right
Step in a room full of goons
Niggas be making their moves
I just be keeping my cool
Because I play by the rules
Raised by Aubrey and Dante Key
Told me how to stack my money
Or to charge it to the game
Cause they never give you credit
Silkk the Shocker when I’m on the vodka
Because I start to Rap off the beat
Master my mind, Mess with her mind
Now I’m gonna Master her P

[Pre Hook]

In so many ways
In so many ways
In so many ways
In so many ways
In so many ways
In so many ways
In so many ways
In so many ways

[Chorus]

In so many ways
I can get this doe
In so many ways
I can get this money
In so many ways
I can get this doe
In so many ways
I can get this money
In so many ways
I can get this doe
In so many ways
I can get this money
In so many ways
I can get this doe
In so many ways
I can get this money
In so many ways
I can get this doe
In so many ways
I can get this money
In so many ways
I can get this doe
In so many ways
I can get this money
In so many ways
I can get this doe
In so many ways
I can get this money
In so many ways
I can get this doe
In so many ways
I can get this money

[Verse 2]

Mentally fortune five hundred
Niggas talk rich but they bluffing
I ain’t been tripping lately
Been doing different lately
Been doing me to a T
That’s how I’m different baby
Plus I’m a Prophet because I make profit
Niggas be hating so we aren’t relating
All of my niggas turn super saiyan
So you know that we ain’t fucking playing
I can get money in so many ways
I can get your bitch in so many ways
If you don’t know, then now you know
If you don’t get, then now you get it

Keeping it dope, keeping it low
