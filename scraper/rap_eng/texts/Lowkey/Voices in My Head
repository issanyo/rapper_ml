Yeah, its Lowkey
DJ Snips on the boards

Gemini... always stuck in two minds, you know


(Verse 1)
Look bruv, this came to be had
And basically that you screw face at me needs to be fatally stabbed
No it's not necessary, just proceed with caution blood
Talk to this thug, teach him about walking in love
Look he is in his car now, and the door isn't shut
You can jump him right now, spill his organs and guts
I told you, I ain't boarin' him up
I dont want a man's blood on my hands, a warning is more than enough
You're dumb, your friends plan to get you hung
And all the cigarettes you smoke growing cancer in your lung
Brother I'm a smart man with plans not some wanker with a gun
Or a mob boss with a mansion or a gangster in the slums
You acting like you ain't got love for the family
I'm focused and you're a man stuck in insanity
Face it, you've lost touch with reality
Walking the streets with the wrong fuckin mentality asking for tragedy

(Hook)
I hear voices in my head telling me what's wrong and what's right
I can't sleep, I guess its gonna be a long night
Voices in my head fucking around with my mind
When I get up tomorrow it's just another mountain to climb

Voices in my head telling me what's wrong and what's right
I can't sleep, I guess its gonna be a long night
Voices in my head fucking around with my mind
When I get up tomorrow it's just another mountain to climb

(Verse 2)
I'm the best emcee to ever touch this mic
And a couple of guys are gonna get cussed tonight
Nah, I'm not too sure about battlin'
I might lose, and get slept on like a travellin'
Listen, before you start your babblin'
I'm armed with punchlines that are sharper than javelins
I swear, bare people have heard this verse
And perspiration got me spitting nervous with words
I knock back top cats in combat with strong rap
And I always look to make eye contact
I flop tracks, forget rhymes
Get defeated in battles and right now I'm getting raped on my contract
Quit the long chat, you talk about defeat now, what's that!?
Your weakness is something I'm shocked at
What I spit is irrelevant
I've been competitive, but all this failure has got me thinking negative

(Hook)
I hear voices in my head telling me what's wrong and what's right
I can't sleep, I guess its gonna be a long night
Voices in my head fucking around with my mind
When I get up tomorrow it's just another mountain to climb

Voices in my head telling me what's wrong and what's right
I can't sleep, I guess its gonna be a long night
Voices in my head fucking around with my mind
When I get up tomorrow it's just another mountain to climb

When I get up tomorrow it's just another mountain to climb...

Big up to all my people climbing the mountains
With the voices in they head, you know

Big Snizzle, Naughty P, my boy Spellz

Yeah, ignore the voices blood, just do what you are doing
