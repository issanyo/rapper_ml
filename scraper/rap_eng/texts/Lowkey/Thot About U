[Hook 1]
Spent a hundred on the coupe
(Hundred on the coupe!)
Whole squad never lose
(Never lose)
Had your chick coming through
(Come through)
She said "I thought about you,"
Well, I thought about it too
I'mma hit you with the truth, boy
(With the truth!)
I'mma hit you with the truth
Something nobody else would do

[Verse 1]
This is where you heard it first
Your whole squad getting murked, boy
What you know about a dope boy?
What you know about a skirt?
She headed with me to the hotel
Hit them with the "don't disturb,"
I don't step up in a church
Because I don't really want to burn
Black Benz out in traffic
Glovebox full of work
Wood grain make it turn, boy
Little money make me swerve
Let me hit them in the nerve!
About to take it to this hurt bitch
(Make it hurt)
First she told me you a "friend"
Then she told me you a fuckboy
(Damn...)
You don't want to hear the rest of it
I'm just getting started, I ain't done, boy
(We ain't even finished)
Real talk, I ain't playing with them
Fuckboys don't assert
(Eat them for desert)
I gotta put them in the dirt
We gon' get your ass served, bitch
She say she want it in reverse
Who am I to be adverse?
Lancaster where I'm from, boy
Young California son, boy
What you know about the heat, bitch?
Got a nug that we keep lit
We ain't fucking with the weak shit
We ain't fucking with the weak shit!
Nah, I don't think he Able
We all know you not the Weeknd

Spent a hundred on the coupe

Whole squad never lose

Had your chick coming through
(Come through)
She said "I thought about you,"
Well, I thought about it too
But you a fake ass dude
And your bitch fake, too
About to hit you with the truth, boy
Something nobody else would do
