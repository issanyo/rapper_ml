[Verse 1: DED DAV]

I'm feeling breathless in the night before me
Breathe a dragon, chug a 40
Poet recording night until the morning with these allegories
Half the stories spoken speak of actions that deemed so disorderly
Order for the action seems to make me want to pack a morgue, see
King in this realm, i kill mortal kombat till your kingdom has fell
Until all the kids are crammed in deep in that well and riches i gather a myth that i tell
You pissing yourself while i picture myself sat on top of your throne
Manifest what I'm dreaming so now that your leaving your castle became what I'm calling my home
Casting spells catapult career soon i got cabbage coming colossal
Kamikaze with my captions I'm constructing contraptions, killer instinct, turn your kids into fossils
Commit a school shooting just to fit in, if your living in America then pitch in
Don't stop until the teacher is dripping, if i accomplish to embarrass ya then fix it
Revolution no looting, resolution no shooting, retribution no stooping
Government incompetent i contemplate conclusion i created my own movement

[Interlude: DED DAV]

How many y'all mo fuckers created your own movement, I'm bringing change
Y'all better watch me CIA, FBI, NSA, you can't stop me, I'm coming for ya

[Verse 2: DED DAV]

I spit a 16 to the crowd like I'm waterboarding
Not important to you yet but better catch us fore you can't afford it
Can't import it to the ports like the corporations been snorting
This corpus got correlation to the kill at your coronation
Never been one to intake in that dirty
But give me a cup cause I'm killing so fast, so Georgia Illuminati is getting so worried
They wanna choose us when they hatching their plan to put the bodies in the ground
Well I'mma use us, snatch every acre of land they stole, matching their plan to tear their empire down
Now let em eat cake fore we cut off their heads, now they know their mistake they necks covered in red
And i know that they dread the life coming right after, no matter their pastor the devil their master

[Chorus: DED DAV]

2016 no one is safe, 2016 not a soul safe, 2016 no one is safe
Try running from this danger then you're running in place

Find me with the reaper chilling, laughing at these bankers children, he telling me to make a killing
Don't stop until they bodies spilling wipe their blood with all their millions x2

[Verse 3: DED DAV]

Super saiyan every verse immerse the fans in universe
A thirst to burst this fucking curse of innocents inside the hearse
I need a moment silent, defy the entire violence
That's vilifying the sirens plus it simplify for tyrants
You a slave to the system, slave to the system
Save all these children, lead a wave of forgiveness
Flip the page for humanity without a calamity
Kill these leaders lead our countries through their constant insanity
Another family deported, another worker extorted
Another drone given orders to kill, got infinite borders
Another infant in a morgue while i sit here recording
Laser guided democracy, can you see the hypocrisy
These wars that we waging, they way more than costly
This world is bleeding, we ain't killing em softly
World peace is my goal, i feel like I'm chosen, and i know the whole a world couldn't succeed in stopping me
