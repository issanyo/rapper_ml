Yeah, you know you never got over my mom an all that ma'am, Well this... this is for you baby, this is why

When I met you I didn't just wanna impress you
You were special I knocked off every other chick except you
Treated you well, in hind-sight maybe too well
I forgot myself, and cared too much how you felt
You say you love me? You need a history test
If you loved me surely you'd wish me success
I wasn't just in it for sex trust me I never was
There was somethin' about you that made me think I fell in love
I even feel stupid when I put it in lyrics
It was on my mind all the time but I wouldn't admit it
So after knowing you were mine I put you next to none
Made you one of three girls to ever met my mom
And it wasn't really surprisin' she didn't like you
But despite dat I still wanted to wife you
We told each other our deepest and darkest secrets
Now we are where we are man I can't believe it

{Chorus}
So low
I don't trust you like them other heads
I shoulda' known you were too good to jump in bed
Don't try to make it better cause the love is dead
It turns out you ain't shit like my mother said
I don't trust you like them other head
I shoulda' known you were too good to jump in bed
Dont try to make it better cause the love is dead
It turns out you ain't shit like my mother said
