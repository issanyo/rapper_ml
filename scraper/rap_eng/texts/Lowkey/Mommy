[Chorus]
Where you at?
Who you with?
When you comin' home?
Like my mommy when she hit my motherfucking phone
Where you at?
Who you with?
When you comin' home?
Like my mommy when she hit my motherfucking phone

That bitch be like my mommy
She always trying to find me
That bitch be like my mommy
She always trying to find me
Where you at?
Who you with?
When you comin' home?
Like my mommy when she hit my motherfucking phone

[Verse]
Way she hit my phone, I think my new hoe just be crazy
First she talking babies, then she tryin' to come and play me
Right on top my dick I swear this bitch just likes to [?]
When I cummed right in her mouth, you think I gave a case of rabies
No, I swear the bitch is insane
Everyday she just inflicting me pain, and [?] I be thinking I should hop outta lane
Cause I swear to god there's something wrong with her brain
Fuck, I got no clue what to do
Now her parent's tryna chew up me too
I'm in trouble no I really mustn't be rude
But I'm bout to go and cop a flight to Peru
Shit, now I'm thinking bout the times we fucked
She's the type of chick to take a condom, poke the front
Please excuse me, if I leave the room I'm throwing up
Have the thought of pregnancy with this crazy little cunt
Cause, I ain't got time for kids, only 18 what the fuck this is
No job, no house, no whip and shit
I gotta rap career ahead of me bitch, so
I'm a dip out the city
I don't give a fuck if the hoe be pretty
See my future and with her is shitty
She can cry all day, I ain't got no pity
Gotta stop going for the crazy hoes, but they turn me on like radios
Don't wanna admit that I'm predisposed to picking cold ass bitches like Eskimos
Ready to blow the bitch like a bomb
Sipping on the Life real smooth and calm
She was mad about my math grade that's whats wrong
I said "Bitch, you acting like my goddamn mom"

[Chorus]
Where you at?
Who you with?
When you comin' home?
Like my mommy when she hit my motherfucking phone
Where you at?
Who you with?
When you comin' home?
Like my mommy when she hit my motherfucking phone

That bitch be like my mommy
She always trying to find me
That bitch be like my mommy
She always trying to find me
