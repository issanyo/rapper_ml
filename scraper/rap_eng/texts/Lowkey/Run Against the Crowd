[Intro]
Mugen is back
Woo
Wooooo oooo
Ooo

[Chorus]
Run against the crowd
With the loud in my lungs
Cup full of rum
Ooo

Run against the crowd
With the loud in my lungs
Cup full of rum

[Verse 1]
Bout to get it done
I’m the one
With a ton of tracks
Used to drive a Buick
But I crunched that
Money just a number game
I crunch that
You stuck on the same thing
Don’t believe in luck
I’m doing everything
Doing it my own way
Push against the flow
YUH
I create my own waves
I create my own flame
I will make my life change
Stranger things have happened
I ain’t talking Demagorgon
I’m shooting for the stars
Too bad I am what they orbit
Ooooh shit
I hope that we recording
Mind racing for 24
Call me Jeff Gordon
Skirt, skirt, skirt, skirt, skirt

[Chorus/Bridge]
Woo
Ooo
Run against the crowd
With the loud in my lungs
Cup full of rum

[Verse 2]
I’ll have my day up in the sun
Chlorophyll fill my blunt
Still been on the run
Stun 'em when I take the stage
Bars hotter than these summer heat waves
Chip off the block
Got a chip on your shoulder
Boy I eat Lays
Ooo
Sunbaked
Baked in the sun
Wearing shades, aye
By the time Saturday come
It is Sunday
Best prepare my runway
Fashion on my plate
Yeah, you know I make statement
Everybody loves me like I’m Raymond
I stay sharp
Like camen teeth
Stay sharp like barbwire
Caveman
With the first fire
Stay in my zone
Tired of you clones
Y’all need to get grown
I’m about to get throwed
All my music on froze
All my clothes so clean
All my green puff sweet
Play this shit in the street
Get a healthy dose
She move her feet
Do the dosey-doe
All my foes clowns
Like when the fuck I go to rodeos?
Get with The Time
Like some Jungle Love
Oh we oh we oh
Oh we oh we oh

[Chorus]
Run against the crowd
With the loud in my lungs
Cup full of rum
Woo
