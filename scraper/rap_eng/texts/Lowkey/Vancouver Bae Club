Got these girls coming like centripetal
Got their tongues
Flipping like reciprocals
Flow so cold
It bring a hoe a chill
Pussy poppin for me
Cuz she know it's real

That Ass too fat
My hand about to slip

Knew she was a go
The way she licked her lips

Head was on fire

Swear that bitch name was cinnamon

See the way we fuck
I swear it belong in cinema

Shawty roll my weed
We never fucking with Reggie mane
Took a shot for me
Now pussy breaking
The Levi mane

Bet that shit be Atlantic
Throw it back if it's aerial
POV the best
The views better from aerial

These theories come
With consequences
These trophies come
Expenses
Member back in the days
When these hoes was just
Some wishes

Now we put on a show
And all these Vixens
Granting wishes

Guess they thought they was genies
Bet that frame be a bottle
Twisted thoughts probably
Loosely based upon of all these fucking models
