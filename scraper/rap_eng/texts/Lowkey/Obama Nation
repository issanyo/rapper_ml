[Intro]
This track is not an attack upon the American people
It is an attack upon the system within which they live
Since 1945 the United States has attempted to overthrow more than 50 foreign governments
In the process the U.S has caused the end of life for several million people, and condemned many millions more to a life of agony and despair

[Verse 1]
The strength of your dreamin
Prevents you from reason
The American dream
Only makes sense if you're sleepin

It's just a cruel fantasy
Their politics took my voice away
But their music gave it back to me

The land where their lumpen are consumed by consumption
Killing themselves to shovel down food in abundance
I guess a rapper from Britain is a rare voice
America is capitalism on steroids

Natives kept in casinos and reservations
Displaced slaves never given reparations
Take everything from Native Americans
And wonder why I call it the racist experiment

Afraid of your melanin
The same as it's ever been
That ain't gonna change
With the race of the president

I see imperialism under your skin tone
You could call it Christopher Columbus syndrome

[Hook 2x]
Is it Obamas nation or an abomination?
Is it Obamas nation or an abomination?
Is it Obamas nation or an abomination?
Doesn't make any difference when they bomb your nation

O! Say can you see by the dawn's early light
What so proudly we hailed at the twilight's last gleaming
Whose broad stripes and bright stars through perilous fight
O'er the ramparts we watched were so gallantly streaming

[Verse 2]
The worlds entertainer
The worlds devastator
From Venezuela
To Mesopotamia

Your cameras lie
Cause they have to hide the savage crimes
Committed on leaders that happen
To try and nationalize

Eating competitions while the worlds been starvin
Beat up communism with the help of bin-laden
Where would your war on terror be without that man
Every day you create more Nidal Hassans

Kill a man from the military, you're a weirdo
But kill a wog from the Middle East you're a hero
Your country is causing screams that are never reaching ear holes
America inflicted a million ground zeros

Follow the dollar and swallow your humanity
Soldiers committing savagery you never even have to see
Those mad at me, writing in emails angrily
I'm not anti-America, America is anti-me

[Hook 2x]
Is it Obamas nation or an abomination?
Is it Obamas nation or an abomination?
Is it Obamas nation or an abomination?
Doesn't make any difference when they bomb your nation

And the rocket's red glare
The bombs bursting in air
Gave proof through the night
That our flag was still there

O! Does that star spangled banner yet wave
O'er land of the free and the home of the brave

[Verse 3]
I don't care if him and Cheney are long lost relations
What matters more is the policies I lost my patience
Stop debating bringing race into conversation
Occupation and cooperation equals profit makin

It's over - people wake up from the dream now
Nobel peace prize, Jay-Z on speed dial
It's the substance within, not the colour of your skin
Are you the puppeteer or the puppet on the string

So many believe that they was instantly gonna change
There was still Dennis Ross, Brzezinski And Robert Gates
What happened to Chas freeman (APAC)
What happened to Tristan Anderson it's a machine that
Keeps that man breathing

I have the heart to say what all the other rappers aren't
Words like Iraq, Palestine - Afghanistan
The wars on, and you morons were all wrong
I call Obama a bomber Cause those are your bombs
