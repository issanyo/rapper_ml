[Verse 1]
After what happened on 9/11
Saddam was a threat they had to find his weapons
Then an inspector said that he never had any
A couple of months later that man's buried
Its damn scary 'cus he exposed their ruthless lies
Then apparently committed suicided
But its obvious that he didn't choose to die
The truth is he was brutally crucified
Just imagine if they invaded Great Britain
Face it that war was based on racism
I love Michael but deep down he's a child
For years they said he was a pedophile
But when it went to court he beat the trial
The reason is money buys freedom so he's allowed
Don't believe the hype or let 'em cease your mind
People please read in between the lines

[Hook]
Read between the lines...
Life is just a pantomime

[Verse 2]
Yo I might get misquoted in an interview
And people might say somthing about me that isn't true
Or say that I did something I didn't do
'Cus I say I'm Arab some people disapprove
Straight up its made, blood, the fakeness annoys me
Like a club night that doesn't pay its employees
I don't go there with my friends to party
'Cus thats about as hip hop as Gwen Stefani
Years back 50 was real, his shit was raw
Now the same man call him a snitch and fraud
Joss Stone didn't sell when she hit the stores
But that changed when she won two Brit Awards
A certain MC set up a clique but found bredda's
Worse than him just so he could sound better
Don't believe the hype or let 'em cease your mind
People please read in between the lines

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Yo, yo, hip hop used to be done on the streets
Now every mug and their mum wants a piece
Suburban parents hated this music their kids love
Now even Britney Spears tries to spit, bruv
They copy whats hot, they're too dumb to innovate
Christina Aguilera, Justin Timberlake
And garage was around in the ends for ages
Then they called it grime and Westwood played it
Then you got American rappers like Mobb Deep
Who spit about murdering people on hot beats
In life they get robbed on street and squash beefs
When you look at the affect they have its off key
Bush rigged the first election even let us find out
Then you wonder why he won again the second time round
Don't believe the hype or let 'em cease your mind
People please read in between the lines

[Hook]

[Outro]
Yeah yeah, you know in these days and times
Weve got to train our minds to read inbetween the lines
Weve got to figure out who's who
Weve got to see the people for who they are
