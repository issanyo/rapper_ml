[Verse 1: Logic]
Hear my words…
Cause I was born in a Shanty town
I used to live around the city and cars
But they threw my whole family out
We don’t have schools so I can't make my family proud
And I’m way past hand-me-downs
I wear what is there for me
And when I was six the army came, there's no fam left to care for me
My brothers and my dad was made to fight
See I was born in Uganda, and this is where I think I'm gonna die
I saw my mother getting raped, my sisters cried
And then they raped my two sisters and just pushed my mum aside
Before ending all three lives
Now I live on the beach, but it ain't' no seaside
I’m sick of seeing the sea, I think I’m nearly 8 years old
And I ain't the only kid like me
Yea this ain’t the saddest story ever told
I want revenge, and I can’t let it go
I know It’s hard to hear, but it’s true stories
There’s so many of us
I know it’s easy to ignore me
I know about living real poorly
Where every day’s gunfire
No food, it's a drought, make the sun higher
I live real street life, I’ve seen faces disappear
And everyday I hustle for food, and while I'm living here
I clear fear out of my thoughts
If I die fam, I die, that’s the way I was taught
And I fought for every scrap of food I ever got
There’s no letter box, you can only help when you come here
And that’s the point I want to get across
Charities don’t make me better off
My teeth hurts, there’s no dentist to fix it
See I’m poverty driven, I don’t envy the rich kids
‘cos this is just life I must live this
Just hear my words, I need more than wishes
Listen..

CHORUS (x2)

Everything Is relative, we all live the same dramas
Just different levels of hardship
Everyone who breaths the air, is a target
You see Home is where the Heart is

[Verse 2: Lowkey]
I pray you can relate to my views and my struggle
They took my home and reduced it to rubble
Nobody cares and no one will help us
Then they wonder why we’re going to their cities
And we’re blowing ourselves up
They acting’ like we killing them, they killing us harder
They couldn’t imagine what life’s like living in Gaza
Insh-allah, with my life I can give you a martyr
Too young to understand what they did to my father
But I’m told he was diabetic
The soldiers said the medicine
In his hand looked like a weapon they’re quite pathetic
They shot his head and never ever will I forget it
They raided my house, broke their way inside and wrecked it
Kidnapped my uncle, took my brother to prison
They let him out, when I look in his eyes now, something is different
Took away his pride, he’s to weak to be militant
I know he got tortured, but I don’t know what they did to him
He’s always acting weird and doing strange things
He’s been out for 3 years but he's never been the same since
The perpetrators are destined to learn
Cause forever they’ll burn, as for my uncle he was never returned
The things they do now are worse than what they did in the past
Why should we hear their voice, they never ever listen to ours
They talk about a road map to peace, it’s just a mirage
My poor little sister got shot, sitting in class
So now you understand that peace is impossible
When they even dropping bombs on people in hospitals
They’re eating, while my people are wasting away
It deepens, we’re not even safe when we pray
My heart’s in the Gaza strip, do you know where this is?
We’re living in pain, whether or not you’re aware of it
Soldiers are cowards and punks, they scared of kids
We throw rocks; they shoot bullets, now who’s the terrorist?
Yeah we hate you
But if my people bulldozed your house and killed your family
You’d hate my race too
This is not anti-Semitic
Cause Arabs are also Semites too, how can they forget it?
This is the look in my brother's eyes
This is the scream that I hear when my mother cries
This is the war between us and the other side
And once upon a time, we were brother tribes
All the stops at the checkpoints are making us madder
Every night we starve, and every day they get fatter
In a minute not one of these statements will matter
Cause It’s time to detonate, Insha'allah I’ll make it to Jannah

CHORUS (x2)

Everything Is relative, we all live the same dramas
Just different levels of hardship
Everyone who breaths the air, is a target
You see Home is where the Heart is
