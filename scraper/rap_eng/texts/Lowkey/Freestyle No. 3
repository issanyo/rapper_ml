[Lowkey]
Rest in Peace to Big Pun, yeah
My headphones are a bit mental
Yeah, crackling a bit and that
Listen, 1,2,1,2,1,2

It's like, it's like these days DJ's won't play a track if I'm on it
But ironically they play DJ Ironik
My logic tells me  I don't rap about the right topics
My politics scare people so they hide from it
Give me a pencil, an instrumental and i'll shine on it
I shine on it so bright i'll burn your eye socket
I'm iconic, that novice is sick but I vomit
Never hear me bite a bar, I don't even like chocolate
Originality, indicates the innovators
With a bit of paper I eliminate you little traitors
Give me the playlist you hypocritical hidden haters
Probably too busy filling in your flipping twitter status
I will spit at least a hundred bars of realness
No need to wheel this
My brother MK filmed it
We can argue about the milk and who spilled it
If you say hip-hop's dead then you killed it
Find the real Rick Ross and ask him
The real Rick Ross not the fat copping fake glasses
I wonder what the real 50 Cent would say
If he knew what his name represents today
Cause lately the game is crazy, shady and shabby
Lil Wayne kiss the man he calls baby and daddy
Is there anyone out here
That thinks that sounds weird?
Lyric for lyric, ain't a single spitter my mouth fears
See my status growin', ill define the baddest rapper flowin'
Catch him in the alley, G, batter Sacha Baren Cohen
I murk sets and destroy jams
While these little boys run around like they're in a boyband
You're out to get scrilla
I'm the Malcolm X spitter
Doubters get bitter because i found respect quicker
Cowards get slimmer, I'm bound to get bigger
They call me the alpha male slash (/) alphabet killer
I give sight to the blind like my bars are braille
You might, want me to fail but i can't prevail
And everybody's saying they're as hard as hell
But if you're such a shower man then why your armpits smell?
Rappers chat cabbage like the life they're having is lavish
When really they lack P's like the Arabic language
You don't want me to make my mark and leave that in time
Cause i say save Iraq and free Palestine
Reality, you could challenge me but never lyrically
Its incredible; my credentials and credibility
Man are hatin', cancer patients never get as ill as me
When it comes to killing careers, I dead it differently
When i grab the mic an' step
I get hyper rhymers vexed
Born with a stick of dynamite up inside my head
Writers try to bite, they must want iron mike to fight instead
Try to find a tighter rhymer, find that I'm the finest yet
Rappers; there's a few that i respect but I don't like the rest
Thinking punches and i ain't talking bout' rights and lefts
To battle's a gamble and when I'm on the mic, rhymers get
Like the violent tyrants in China because they don't like Tibet
I got relatives addicted to gambling
That's why gambling I haven't dabbled in
I see addiction everywhere when I'm travellin'
That's why i stay on point like a javelin
I know fakes addicted to sayin' keep it real
I know obese people addicted to eatin' meals
I know I went deep but I can go deeper still
I know insomniacs addicted to sleepin' pills
I know a lot of people addicted to cigarettes
And a man addicted to watching porn on the internet
I know breddas that spend their whole day sippin' becks
And still swear down they're not addicted yet
I know kids addicted to gettin' bigger reps
And couch potatoes addicted to sittin' in their bed
And man addicted to crystal meth with the biggest debts
And frisky little skets addicted to giving head
Some are addicted to sales like street vendors
I know grown women addicted to Eastenders
People addicted to power like dumb feds
I know grown women addicted to sunbeds
Anythings addictive if you abuse it
There's a long list of addictions, just choose it
Addiction of the dude, you're listening to
My addiction is you
Cause I'm tight spittin my life's written, I like women
In real life these rappers are like polite women
Dont fight with em', grab the mic, kill em'
Let em' die wishin' 9 minutes of live lyrics
I'm quite different
Uncivilized villainous guy killin' your hype, listen
My vision is like life so why try dissin'?
My mission is Zeitgeist cause my time's tickin'
Einstein, but fight night I'm Mike Tyson n'
Guys might hype with em', strike like lightnin'
My rhymes, like drivebys are quite frightenin'
Silly billys say biddy biddy bye bye to em'
I despise the white lies these nice guys try to sing
I can't make love songs for the school girls
Because I'd rather tell the youngers, "this is your world"
I don't make songs about knives and straps
Cause' I'd rather show you there's more to life than that
And I don't dress up and act stupid in the videos
Wish I could moonwalk but I can't really, bro
Don't talk about watches, cars or pretty clothes
Cause' there's more to life than raving and bagging silly flows
On my stereo I hear a lot of these iffy flows
I pity these souls couldn't even see me on their tippie toes
If you take the piss like kidney stones
I'm lyrically drillin' holes in you iffy milly vanilly clones
