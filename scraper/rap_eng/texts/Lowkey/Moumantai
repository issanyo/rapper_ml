[Verse 1: Harvey Deux]
Cruising through the projects
Late night when a nigga need contact
I been searching this phone for my contacts
I see you pop up and I want sex
True
I'm a dog and that comes natural
Most of these niggas still tryna catch you
You been ducking and dodging for months
Hoping I'd lose interest if i don't get what I want

But I'm very patient;
Wait wait no i'm tired of waiting
Need someone on top girl my body's aching and
Love heals all but your spot is vacant

And lately you tell em you done with a nigga
But i'd do anything to keep fucking up witcha

Pick a time and place and, Position i'm with it
The conversation-
Is way more specific-

When its me and you right?-
Don't wanna sleep when I text you good night
And you don't really think that we fighting the good fight
We both doing dirt and for now we lose sight
Cuz they don't see us and its us just 2 right?
No way-
But maybe all the fussing and fighting
And the fatiguing and trying give you a reason to ride it
I'm tryna see whats inside it
Needing the gratification
But you believe in something else and there's a reason you're patient
I get it-

[Verse 2: Harvey Deux]
Cruising through the projects
Late night when a nigga need contact
I been searching my phone for my contacts
I see you pop up and I want sex
False

You're the light in my darkest time
You shine the brightest when Its after 9

I need answers cuz shit been getting hard
I need a 'Moumantai', you know, without the bars-

Excuse me mama
Wait I just need a second, honest
Right, I'ma need a sacred promise
That you ain't getting mad at what I'm becoming

Yeah-

Funny how the money change niggas
And even though you put them on they ain't even tryna change witcha
And they  tryna crop me out but we in the same picture
Then again I dub em on the days that I spend witcha

You're my little angel
The universes way of saying thank you
Devastated if you let em take you
Devastated if you let em take you
Gotta thank the ones that went and made you
Call if you need me I'd gladly save you
Take it easy anytime I praise you
Devastated if you let em take you

[Verse 3: Harvey Deux]
Cruising through the projects
Late night when a nigga need contact
I been searching my phone for my contacts
Fuck that, pull up for the rough sex

A nigga horny, you been watching the snap
Girl just call me
Hate that you treat the shit like its all me
And all of them dudes you with, them niggas corny
Hate that I know them niggas, I mean damn
You ain't even show me love, i'm in town
Drove through your hood the windows was down
And you ain't even pick up once
Or lick the tip just once
Or roll the blunt, or hold the blunt
There's a first time for everything mama
I stay real low to avoid the drama
But you hate nigga like your name was karma


[Verse 4: Harvey Deux]
Cruising through the projects
Late night when a nigga need contact
I been searching my phone for my contacts-
No one's picking up, sipping cognac

Type of lonely night I want (bleep) back

But shes gone forever
Yeah I noticed that shes gone forever
And I'ma sing this whole song forever
Sleep alone forever
Keep it all together, nah why try?
Best part of mes gone like poof viola
Keeping honest with girls , just truth why lie
Cuz some times she just needs a stand up guy

And sometimes the need thing is necessary
Because being alone now is fucking scary
So much pressure for us to just cross the line
But in the heat of the moment just Moumantai
