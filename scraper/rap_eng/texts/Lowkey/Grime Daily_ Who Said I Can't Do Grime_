[Lowkey]

Whether you’re in HMV or KFC, H.M.P. or A&E
I make them see A-N-D let you know the C-A-S-E
From LDN not NYC, on the M-I-C I’m M.I.B
Like BIG, the MVP, VIP to the E-N-D
E.G. my CD is way too D-E-E-P
That goes for your TV screen, DVD or BBC
ITN or ITV, C-O-Ps say ID please
S-T-O-P like IC3, wanna see me hooked to an I.V. G
In a ICU but I’m N-O-T
They went OT with the M.O.B
Can’t see me through the F-O-G
Don’t cuss mothers of S.O.B.s
These MCs are O.A.P.s
Wanna hype up I’m like ‘OK G’
You think your B-A-D get a P-E-N and a P-A-D
If the C.I.A. and the F.B.I. the MI6 and the MI5
Get on the A3 then I drive, turn up the A.C. FYI
MJ like P-Y-Ts, LOL another T-Y-P
I E-A-T on E-I-D, twist CID like Levi Jeans
D-I-E like BNP, EDL just BFGs
Youths don’t want no GCSEs
They want COD on the PS3
I’m like DP or PE or KRS from BDP
Download this on your MP3
Send it to your MP and MTV
Not on this ting like A.D.D
Your CD I rate PG
Like KKKs with AKs my AKA is AA
Take you off the road ASAP
DDT these JLS MCs
What you just saw basically…
Is how to murder the ABCs

Cos I’m back in the booth
Rappers wanna chat about the strap they stashed in the back of the boot
But I chat to the youths, abstract or backpacked
My attributes are stacked to the roof
I capture the truth, pour it on tracks with my views
Then I sell it out the back of the boot
I’m positive you’re negative, you’re whack and confused
I’m back and the fact is your Dad’s in the room
Ain’t a chap that you rappers can battle with
Every chat that I spat is immaculate
Any track that I smash I’m attacking it
Heard you rap fam, your tracks are inadequate
Your CD was cack, it was crap, I’m dashing it
You follow fashion, with rap I’m passionate
Blood starts splashing, your whip you dash in it
Said you were packing a Mac in the back of it
Kizzy, I’m busy, I’m really a brilliant guy
It’s gritty and sh*tty but really the city is mine
If you diss me, pity the silly billy that try
From Bricky to Piccadilly to Mississippi I’m live
Get Milli if you Milli Vanilli’s gimme the vibe
Get Jiggy like Willy spitting the wittiest rhymes
Uncivilised, ignorant, diligent type
And I victimise an idiot a million times
Hey hey we ray-rays will spray flames
Take snakes off the road like AA
So waste brays, vacate and make space
You bait fakes, ain't straight you stay fake
Chase papes, you chase dames like ‘babes wait’
On a lay-lay you date rape to save face
In the same place we maintain and ain't changed
We make tapes that rake papes like Kay Slay
Don’t dismiss or diss this, we live this
From Lisbon to Ipswich
For instance the dick’s got your sister addicted
Oh look! Big tits came for a quick fix
You’re limper than Bizkit, you nitwits
A monster, a beast when I stomp on the beat
If the nonsense you speak is not gonna cease
I’m conscious but leave unconscious emcees
Don’t respond to the beef if you're nonces or NEETS
Get ill upon the rhythm when I kill ‘em with the lyrical
Finish up my dinner then I drill ‘em with the syllable
Don’t really care what you did or what you didn’t do
Little fools are miniscule, spitting isn’t difficult
You found your mind cos I’m outta mine
Fuck a pound sign, came for the crown in grime
I told you once, I told you a thousand times
I’m a fountain of acid you’re alkaline
You alcoholics are out of time
Got a mountain to climb if your mouth is lying
Bow to his highness I’m bound to shine
Let me coach you on vocals and how to rhyme
Think I’m vexed with your indirects
If I spit rhymes next I slit five necks
I’m a big time threat to you pissed sly vets
This guy lives life inside stress
I’m the best in the game, not impressed with the fame
I’m testing my aim if I send for your name
Successful or lame, they kept it the same
But whatever the weather it’s destined to change
Couldn’t give a f*ck for your creps and your chain
You slobber on the mic like a sket giving brain
I’m mental, deranged, crush temples and frames
My pencil will end you like petrol and flames
Burns like syphilis, you nerds are privileged
When I die you can say that you heard the sickest spit
My verse is limitless, the earth is spinning quick
Pure words of wickedness that I murk the rhythm with
Heard you were good, it’s a shame that you’re not
Don’t care about your chain or the fame that you got
Keep my name on your brain cos I came for your spot
What you’re making is pop, they say it’s a lot
You’re whack bro with your cat flow, but your whack though
Put your cap low, prat go back home
This monster is stronger than Castro’s backbone
I attack those little fat bowcats so
Don’t ever get arrogant, don’t start panicking
Phone your management, mumbling
Man are in the manor getting’ mad again
Don’t care ‘bout your swagger, mandem or your medallion
What’s the matter then maggot? Where’s your magnum
When there’s beef mandem are missing like Madeline
I been badder than you and your bag of men
What’s happening when I kill ‘em with a pad and pen
Ain’t got the bars in your pad to match me
Me, I’m so fast I should catch a taxi
Have you got the picture like paparazzi?
You like the facts to go back to back B
When I watch you rap it’s like crazy comedy
I’ve got a ‘don’t rate fake G’ policy
F*ck your awards I don’t rate these nominees
Just little fickle Jay-Z wannabes
You hobos are old though, it’s oh so true
No promo, logo or photo-shoot
F*ck your postcode, MOBO and Polo suit
My opponents are hoping I won’t go through
I’m certainly burning these burglars verbally
Murking these murkers ‘til mercenaries murder me
Burst in and turning your Burberry Burgundy
Guernsey to Germany, Jersey to Bermondsey
True rhyme, ain’t got a pen, you can use mine
Ain’t staying underground like a tubeline
Im’ma come through with shine in due time
Which one of you pr*cks said I can’t do grime?
Which one of you pr*cks said I can’t do grime?
Which one of you pr*cks said I can’t do grime?
