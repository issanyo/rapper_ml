[Verse 1: Senya]
First off Senya morphing same as seasons and impeding off the sleeping of the fame on which i'm feeding, dark of night creeping iris red like i'm a demon realize the lines of lies inside the guise that hides the pretense, holy rhymes i'm a pastor spitting meaning ever preaching to the fiends of the music like my team is, posted in the den smoke is loud hear it screaming bunch of niggas like some mobsters so we gotta stay scheming, women come and give me loving do it deeper now you peeping all the girlies scream my name like they beliebers, and she fine but could never be a keeper they in line and my dick is the midnight feature, but that's basic i don't care about it either if she don't support the movement see ya later imma leave her, rappers blood the potion and so you could call it ether now i'm spitting more rhymes than a Dr.Suess creature, sick wit it witty i'm killing em like its cancer, similar santa getting death letters from prancer written by dancer while he popping pills of Mylanta taking place on a nice bright shiny day in atlanta, shocking, harvesting stock and stopping the plotting of coppers shoppers and robbers at night like i'm watching gotham, some of my niggas nice but some other ones got a problem for constantly dropping drops of some blood like hotel Rwanda, breathe in the marijuana it's potent choking my partners could possibly call em robin they packing it like they farmers zookeepers is what they job is the way they holding the lamas the shaman causing caution and chomping souls like they was ramen, and still rhyming

[Verse 2: C.T.P]
I never walk, I glide like I'm a fucking snake on ice, I'm coming for your life A 45 and a knife, I'm takin all of your wives Niggas go and try to dive, but no one ever survives, I'll hunt them in their afterlives
I'm not a human I'm a demon, I got your bitches drowning and they chokin on my semen
Leave me with a 40, leave the whole block screamin
Roll up in a black buggati with the rims gleamin
If I see a snitch, you know the whole squad gonna squirt him, Pop a nigga, leave the 40 hot enough to burn him
Bitch I leave the 40 hot enough to make him melt, I'm just tryna feed my niggas like I'm Roosevelt
If you talkin shit Bitch I'll make you taste the street, I'll sit and slay you sinister, bullets hit like it's sleet
I'm the minister take a seat, I repeat your defeat I'm discreet in the dark so duck dactfully when I'm bringing the heat
You're weak, you reek, you're meek, it's bleak, they sleep, when the pistols gripped by their cheek, They geeks, I'm Greek with the warfare
Blend in with the crowd like I'm Mystique, My fury reaches it's peak
When my technique makes niggas crumble like they're old antiques, I'm not the nigga to mess with, I'm not unique but i'd damn sure leave yo ass prayin' like it's holy week
It's prodigy demonic ideology on your head cosmotology I accept no apologies and
