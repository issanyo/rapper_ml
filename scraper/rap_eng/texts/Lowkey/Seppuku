[Hook:]
It was a Sunday morning, they both drowning in E&J
They had each other but still needed that brief escape
They both broken, thats a void that they could never fill
But they coincide, living in the moment cuz of how it feels

[Verse 1]
He was masking all emotion joking knowing
That he really fuckin tryna hide the pain
She she was swimming in the liquor tryna get the courage
Just to mothafuckin cut her veins
His Shirts stiff from tears that dried
Emotions he couldn't keep inside
Suicide that crossed they mind
But Every time he close his eyes
All he see, is his momma cryin
His mamma said whats the point of living if you not here
He didn't know it but that was somthing he had to hear
All the work she did tryna raise you
All by her self, and went back to school
To get certified for a 9-5, just to feed you
And keep you alive
All the fuckin love and things she provide
And you contemplating your own demise
Picture burring yo own child
If he was To weak to just rise above
Crushing everyone he ever knew and loved
If He wasn't here she couldn't live with that
The thought of death He wish retracted
Selfish, inconsiderate
Doesn't matter how dark it gets
This is life nigga
Deal with it

[Hook:]
It was a Sunday morning and they both drowning in E&J

They both broken thats a void that they could never fill
But they coincide, living in the moment cuz they know its real

[Verse 2]
A certain sadness really sitting in her
And her brother was her only father figure
Cuz her father passed, she was only little
Now the crib raided, feds took the nigga
Cuffed her momma and the nigga sleepin wit her
She was devastated he was in the system
Now her momma gotta notice for eviction
So its hard for her to be optimistic
She said the alcohol really make her just feel it all
He tried to bring her back knowing that she already gone
Too deep in the shadows existing in her cornered walls
Thats when he noticed the healings that was up on her arms
He said if you loved me dont do it no more
Cuz I understand the shadows i been thru it before
Before he told his-self that he wouldn't stick around
But for the sake of her, still stayed down
Because cuz it counts the most right about now
Till one night he caught her in the kitchen blade to the wrist
Vein bouta split, life bouta slip
Thinkin what the fuck are you doing bitch!?
She said you can go back in the room
Imma be there soon
But from that view
Man He just knew, that that wasn't true
All the effort put in was a waste of time
Cuz she contemplating her own demise
So he walks to her, hands her the knives
He Said i love you, but before you decide
To cut too deep and bleed out and die
Think of everyone that you'll kill inside
