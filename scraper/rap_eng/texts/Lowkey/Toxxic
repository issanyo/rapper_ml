[Hook]
You needed me for Direction
I neededed you for Affection
But This shit is toxic (3x)

I tried to fix your emotions
But You were just so fucking Broken
This shit is toxic (3x)

[Verse 1]
Feelings reminiscing when it hit me
And your voice in my head fucking wit me
Don't kiss them other bitches, how u kiss me
Don't lick another bitche how you lick me
Yet You always tyna find a reason to leave
And I'm always tryna find a reason to cheat
But i never crossed the line and i never did deceive
And this never what i wanted but this what it gotta be
If she lying to her Momma its easy to lie to me
And i always looked the other way
And i let u do ya own thing
For it blow up in my fucking face
I guess we was far from compatible
And I ignored the signs like an avenue
I guess i was just tryna right my wrongs
And prove i could be a good guy for once

My conscious justifying my bullshit
Ashanti i'm looking so fucking foolish
You text me, I text back like whose this?
Knowing that your number saved as
Don't answer dis ungrateful bitch
Why you yelling n shit
I don't even know what the fuck this bout
I'm trying help u out, that's when u start to shout
You know what get ya shit and get the fuck out my house, word
If you was honest it wouldn't be anything to hide
Every night u getting drunk n gotta cry
But I'm a hypocrite. i feel so empty inside
We in Miami can u try to have a good time
I'm trying
To keep up with you
Sick of being stressed out now i'm numb to you
Everybody telling me not to fuck wit you
But when youu put it in ya mouth its something hard to do
Lord

You needed me for Direction
I needed you for Affection
This shit is toxic (3x)

I tried to fix your emotions
You were so fucking Broken
This shit is toxic (3x)

If you loved me you would never walk away
Far from optimistic constantly complaining
Learn to love ya self before you stop pain and
I just hope you do Before its too late

Cause this shit is toxic
This shit is toxic (3x)
