[Hook]

NO, NO, We don't want them (3x)
We don't want them (x2)
NO, NO, We don't want them (3x)
We don't want them (x2)

[Verse 1]

Look at my face, Am I everything that you hate?
Half-this, Half-that, born in the U.K?
You wanna stop immigration? Well, it's too late
We're here living and there's nothing that you can do mate
Worst comes the worst, You should pack your suitcase
Scared little man with a screw loose and a screw face
I am the hindrance to the ignorance you bring
Doesn't make a difference the flippin' pigment of your skin
Can't blame immigrants for the state of the economy
Some come here from former British colonies
Some come here to escape British foreign policy
You make a mockery of democracy and equality
Scapegoat the innocent to gain votes
They slipped through the net once by next time they won't
We don't want people like you on our shores
Don't talk to my face, talk to my passport

[Hook]

NO, NO, We don't want them (3x)
We don't want them (x2)
NO, NO, We don't want them (3x)
We don't want them (x2)

[Verse 2]

Let me tell you what it is (What?)
Ethnic minorities are disillusioned with British politics
And as for the neighbours...the white working class, they became disillusioned with the labour
That's the only reason, these prats got any power
They scream '"Freedom of speech" but I won't let these cowards. Above all the divisions, we're still human bro
You don't like the B.N.P? but did you use your vote?
Cause they did, and they don't like you cause' your skin's different
That's why I don't respect Nick Griffin or his vision
Look at history, Let me teach you a little lesson
Hitler rose to power in a recession
And it could happen here if it really gets dodgy
But if it does, that'll be over my dead body
I hear your threats hardy har, you could hardly harm me
B.N.P aka British Nazi Party
