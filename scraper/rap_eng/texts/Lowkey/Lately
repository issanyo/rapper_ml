[Verse 1]
Lately I’ve been thinking about calling you 
But I just can’t find the words to say
Girl, I don’t know why I just can’t leave it alone
But I gotta tell you

And I know it’s been a long, long time
But I’m just hoping I can change your mind
And I know that it’s late, and I know that he’s right there next to you
But we both know that I’m running out of time

[Hook]
Do you remember when we used to be in love?
Well I still feel the same, you know ain't nothing changed
Remember when I used to hold you, remember when I told you?
Lately I’ve been wishing that we never went our separate ways

It’s just this thing about you, I can’t be without you
You can’t tell me that with him it feels the same
Remember when I used to hold you, remember when I told you?
Lately I’ve been wishing that we never changed, never changed

Lately I’ve been wishing that we never changed

[Verse 2]
Take it all
You can take what's left of me
Cause' you know that I can't live without you

You're my everything
Ain't no one who knows me like you do
Cause' baby, I was meant for you

[Hook]
Do you remember when we used to be in love?
Well I still feel the same (still feel the same)
You know ain't nothing changed
Remember when I used to hold you, remember when I told you?
Lately I’ve been wishing that we never went our separate ways
(And girl you know it's just that)

It’s just this thing about you, I can’t be without you (And I know you know)
You can’t tell me that with him it feels the same
Remember when I used to hold you, remember when I told you?
Lately I’ve been wishing that we never changed, never changed

[Outtro]
Lately. Lately I've been wishing that we never changed
Fuck it
