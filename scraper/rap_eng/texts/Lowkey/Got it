[Hook]
Started to rap and they doubt it
Mac he just him me, I got him
He hit my phone like I got you
Do not let these people stop you
Fonzi just told me I got it
Now we gon' pull up exotic
Trust me I got it, I got it (x2)

[Verse 1]
Trust me I got it, I do
Been in the trap it ain't new
Promise to you it ain't new
I know you probably assume
I'll be in Cali by June
I keep on telling ya'll soon
These bitches won't give me room
Now they want to show affection
I don't know what you expecting
They look at me for direction
I ain't even giving lessons
I ain't even tryna test you
Then I had to drop Finessin'
Gucci on me, I'm confessing
Louis Viton how they checking
Wanna get it, then let's get it
Pull up on you in a second
I done did it on the first time
Now I got them second guessing
Now Mac about drive, look at me now
Look at the people that I keep around
And I know people that don't know me
But they down to hold it down for me, for me
Riding round through the damn bay, and they all on me
Yeah, all eyes on me
Yeah, I know you see it
I know you see it
