[Kayem, Verse 1]

In the darkest hour, when the world has turned away
And no-one's watching
When the sky has turned to gray
And you have no options
When your voice is illegal
Only choice for the people
Is to stand up proudly
In the face of death
And it ain't waste of breath when you speak up loudly
On behalf of the kids in the street with no pot to piss in
Living on they own cos' their papas missing
Don't know if he's dead or he's locked in prison
Disappeared, they considered him the opposition
But now I'm having visions and dreams I shouldn't see
Like could we be this close? nah couldn't be
But if the people in Egypt and Tunis can do this
Decide their fate, why wouldn't we?
More than forty years he done rocked the nation
Under occupation we can not be waiting
We gonn' stop debating, when one of us dies
Ten jump in line ready to box with satan

[Chorus]
You can't take our freedom or take our soul
Take our Freedom or take our soul
You are not the one that's in control
You are not the one that's in control
La Ilaha Il-Allah, no power's greater than God
Go ahead and devise your plans, at the end of the day
You are just a man

[Lowkey]
The movement is building
When the fathers past the scars through to the children
They shooting to kill them
But the question I'm asking is who's gonna heal them
Look up to the clear skies and down to the brown
Where the blood, sweat & the tears dry
We are questioning their lives
And realize that is not a threat when the fear dies
So we are not afraid anymore
And you can't play God with our lives
You attempted to cage every thought
But resistance is locked in our minds
From Millbank Tower to Tahrir Square
Nobody can deny its a fact we are there
We are not leaving until we got freedom
We are willing to bleed and even stop breathing
You must have known from the rust on your throne
That you couldn't maintain by cuttin the phones
Justice alone will sustain our presence
Tunisia to Libia, Bahrain to Yemen

[Khaled]
I done tasted blood
I done tasted sweat
I done tasted tears
I ain't taste regret
I done tasted blood
I done tasted sweat
I done tasted tears
I ain't taste regret
Now I'm a grown man, ain't never seen my homeland
Ain't been closer than a Magic Jack phone plan
Dad escaped jail and he dedicated
His life to the cause but he never made it
This ain't about my father getting retribution
Or my uncles getting tortured with electrocution
Other uncles getting hung in public executions
Just simply coming up with the best solution
And I don't know why it seems
This guy's regime
Keeps pushing through the silent screams
Won't take you half an hour, to figure that this coward
Can only get his power through violent means
Killing all the doctors in the hospitals
When the regime just seems so unstoppable
When freedom feels like it's impossible
The People rise and overcome every obstacle

[Chorus]

[Lowkey]
Dictators are nervous, take from the people
Give straight to the serpents
The sick place that this earth is
Will only ever change, if change for a purpose
By the people, for the people
None are supreme, all are equal
There's mountains to touch, The power is us
Devour these cowards with the sound as we rush
I am not a leader, a teacher or preacher
If my people aren't free, than I am not either
I refuse to be silenced And we will not stop short of
Removing these tyrants There comes a time where summarize
Events gone Look up to the sky and wonder why you're next
You could call this the Butterfly Effect
I despise the rats that disguise the facts
When they know the population is fighting back
Inside of crack, this time I bad, like the second Bouazizi
Did light that match
