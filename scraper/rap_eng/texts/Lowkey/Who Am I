Yeah lowkey
Who am i?

[Chorus x2]
Who am i?
A man Contemplating suicide
Cause in this place and time my frame of mind is do or die
Who am i?
A man with nothin' to lose
Who am i?
A man speaking my views with something to prove

A young man in central london running for the night bus
Passed baseheads bunning on the white stuff
Rollerblading crackfiends old and aging drag queens
Hustlers that know the way to stack cream
Clicks that go to raves and jack teens
?????????????? know about bus drivers
Me and my people are writers now fuck rhymers
I crush cyphers close fates and shut eyelids
But i'm deeper than that and i ain't been sleepin' recently
So i need to relax things on my mind
When i put ink on this line ima poet but i
Been both a loser and winner
Been both stupid and clever
Been both student and teacher
Stress now got me usin' the reefer for the pain relief
Who am i?
A man that plays for keeps and can't be told shit
That's what makes me me

[Chorus x2]
Who am i?
A man Contemplating suicide
Cause in this place and time my frame of mind is do or die
Who am i?
A man with nothin' to lose
Who am i?
A man speaking my views with something to prove

Sometimes it harder to sleep when in the streets
It's just drama and beef and the karma is deep
I seen so many walk the path of deceit
Living in the heart of this beast kindness i done that
The price of that been in knife fights and scraps
But never ever ever think my guys are strapped
Cause i escaped that by trying to rap
For every shotta every fiend buying the crack
Every drug smuggler thugs hustlers i'm not one of ya
Rappin' wise i'm the best in the land
Still i rep for the fam just a man obsessed with a plan
Till i get the checks in the bank
I won't stop like a red light i'll wreck mics
Don't even tempt me i'm a weeded mc
So check the website cause my dreams are empty
And i'm droppin' a album next time make sure you get me
