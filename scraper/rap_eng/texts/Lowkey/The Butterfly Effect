[Hook: Adrian]
If you could go back, what would you change
What would you do again ever would remain the same
What would you give, and what would you keep
What would you take, and what would you leave

[Verse 1:]
I see an old lady holding the door
As I tumble out my wheel chair and roll to the floor
First thing in the morning in the grocery store
Not sure if this alcoholics body can hold me no more
I hustled up enough change for the whiskey in my hand
Tried to tell all the people but they didn't understand
Too many years spent sleeping in the gutters
On my hands and on my knees, eating from the rubbish
Roam the streets with very little keeping me sane
Too many twisted visions left engraved deep in my brain
Nightmares are right there and I don't think good thoughts
Happy memories became haze and days when I could walk
Make me hate those that have a life and could stand
Do you people know what I sacrificed for this land?
My aching heart can't feel the bladed glass in my feet
Don't take a glance cause I'm just a face you pass in the street

[Hook: Adrian]
If you could go back, what would you change
What would you do again ever would remain the same
What would you give, and what would you keep
What would you take, and what would you leave

[Verse 2:]
Evicted from my home couldn't scrape up the right rent
No heat in there all I had was the lights left
Spent months eating sleeping shitting in my mess
Thinking back to when my wife left, I was quite stressed
Guess all my addictions had got the best of me
Sometimes I wish to change my fate or was it destiny
Look up to the sky on rough nights wondering why
I saw our baby girl pass in front of my eyes
Before it the thought of it tortured me
Only lived six days was born with deformities
Still the birth really filled me with joy
Even though I kinda hoped it would still be a boy
I was dealing with demons I carried with me daily
Wanted to carry on my name when I had the little baby
Thinking in deep ways til my soul is torn
Of the bitter sweet day I came home from war

[Hook: Adrian]
If you could go back, what would you change
What would you do again ever would remain the same
What would you give, and what would you keep
What would you take, and what would you leave

[Verse 3:]
I roll out the hospital on honorable discharge
I looked down saw my body with horrible big scars
Brave face but it was bad at night I would break down
I woke up and I was paralyzed from the waist down
Was in a coma for a few weeks before I closed my eyes
I was just another soldier with two feet
On all type of drugs that set me higher
Shot by my comrade official name friendly fire
Everyone was screaming but I only heard her
And everyone was crying but I only heard her
As I looked down to what I had done
I had a split second to contemplate what I had become
Like it or not trained to kill like it was a job
Wild or not she was just a child with a rock
Threat in my eye and the power in my left hand
I swear my finger slipped and then the trigger went bang...
