[Verse 1: La Mique]

On My Low Life shit
Bitches wanna trip, cause I'm 5'6

Laugh at me now, Bitch you gon cry to me later
You just gon hop in your bag, Ima hop out of the ranger

Everything I spent on you, Ima make it back
Triple 6 all on my back, Triple 6 all on my hat

Ignoring the phone
You know I ain't calling you back
No I ain't calling you back

I'm feeling myself
I feel the man like I'm Pac
I hit that broad with the Mac

The Mac and cheese
The combo with fries and greens
The Chicken and rice and beans

But she don't want a nigga where her eyes can see

I said girl you gon be lucky if it's me
She said "please, only thing you ever cuffing is my jeans"

Tried to give that bitch a hug she said "boy don't touch me"

[Christal]

"Eww Nigga don't touch me, get away from me!"

[La Mique]

I'm looking at her like whassup? she said "boy you ugly"

[Christal]

"Nigga you ugly as shit anyway"

[La Mique]

Aight cool, I won't stress it, I'ma let you rock
I'ma throw my jersey on, my shorts and my adidas socks

[Chorus]

You know Ima ball on that bitch, dunk up on her head
I'ma ball on that bitch, dunk up on her head

Yeah, 5 foot 6, I think I'm Spud Webb
Yeah I'm 5 foot 6, I think I'm Spud Webb

[Verse 2: La Mique]

Okay
S. P. U. D. W. E. , Double the B
She was the shit in the A?
I had to double the D

Your niggas ain't fucking with me
I sip a cup of the tea

I throw it up from the 3
I'm taking 1 for the team

I'm taking all of the cream
Run up the check and I go

I'll take a chance for Savannah (Jayde)
Worst she can tell me is no

You could've slowed your roll
And rolled but no you doing the most

Most the time I don't worry
Because you is a hoe

You was just riding the bench
Moving from brodie to bro

Feel like Jerome 86
I had to dunk on the "bro"

[Bridge]

I had to dunk on the "bro"
I had to dunk on the "bro"

You was just riding the bench
Moving from brodie to bro

I feel like Jerome 86
I had to dunk on the "bro"
