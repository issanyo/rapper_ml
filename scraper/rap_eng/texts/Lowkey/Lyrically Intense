Okey, Lowkey, Daily Duppy yeah
Listen listen..

Kizzy is the name I'm lyricall insane
I kill 'em on any rhythm plus I'm critically acclaimed
But misery and pain has driven me to change
All these spitters seem the same the whole industry is lame
The poisonous fam, get familiarized
Real recognize real I got familiar eyes
And If you try to stop my familia rise
Get victimized like that innocent Brazilian guy
They're saying Lowkey's a terrorist
But when I reveal dangerous styles you better go seek a therapist
The flow's deep & effortless, you phonies could never diss
Best thing since sliced bread I don't need your bread in it
Think about this stuff before you run your mouth and cuss
I don't want to have to travel on the underground or bus
So I wake up everyday and wonder how to bust
The only U.S. I ever gave a fuck about is us
Forget glory on the tele
What you know about puttin' out three CDs before you were twenty
You know that you heard of me
What you know about being eighteen and doing shows in Germany
What you know about four stars in a magazine
What you know about the game waist man I have the key
What you know about hundred bars on the radio? Nothing
You weren't makin' dough, you were lazy bro
You're following, before you were bothering I was on this thing
Songs fill my pockets with profit I'm being honest kin
It's all politics before anybody hollered it
Turned down chances cause I knew what they were offering
Called out a couple names had the game gossiping
Never heard me on a track with Lady Sovereign - with her modeling
Think you're sick cause your vids got a whip with a model in
Shot my first CD myself It was astonishing
Stockers wouldn't stock us now we tell em' stop groveling
I shot a shot to shoppers and shotters we got a lot of them
Coppers can't cop it but copiers should stop copying
Topping the toppers from Oxford to Nottingham
All your favorite rappers want us to do a song with them
Me? I ain't bothered with all of the fake politics
Me I just live my life and stay positive
Epitome of verse killing, lyrically I'm hearse filling
Been out for a minute G, now mini-me's are surfacing
Your whole trilogy still didn't beat my worst rhythm
What you'd figure it be? You are ill as me? I heard different
See, your favorite MC, I nurtured him
And see, all your favorite beats, I murdered 'em
Face it, your clique is wasted I won't work with 'em
They certainly heard of me from Guernsey to Birmingham
Cause the name holds weight
And still I wake up to the same old hate
And pray for a day my face ain't so baked
I'm a rapper, other rappers act like they don't rate
Cause DJ's will get my tunes and play 'em eight shows straight
Rewind them and drop bigger bombs than NATO mate
To be real, it isn't all about the radio play
Cause we all wanna bust, there just ain't no space
But the -

Nobody's gettin' record sales
AKA's full of sweet boys trying to impress the girls
The only rappers a lot of breaders have ever felt
Are dead or depressed in jail and never getting mail
When alive, they hate, when gone, you're the best ever
This ain't a comeback, fuck that, I'm a trend setter
People talk and get me differently twisted
Cause this rap shit is the bitchiest business
So what you peddle pebbles, your dead when my pencil moves
On every level I rep with rebels, I never lose
You resemble devils the terrible tales you sell the youths
You need to fix up yourself and tell the truth
You've been rich for ten plus years, still selling crack
Saying that you're still busting guns, why you tell 'em that?
Knowing that these kids emulate every rhyme you ever spat
You need to get your role models from somewhere else instead of rap
You shouldn't even need me to explain
You know that they imitate what you speak and what you say
You got more power than their parents but you leading 'em astray
You don't tell 'em that these illegal ways will lead 'em to the cage
I'm pissed, why? Got dick riding breadders hatin'
While you spit rhymes that misguided my generation
You're not real, cause what you're saying ain't the truth
You're trying to kill the kids, me? I'm trying to save the youth

Hold on...

I said the future's removal of humans, computers pursued revolution and Lucifer moved in
Hell is hot, we burn like chips in a pan
At your kid's birth they'll insert a chip in his hand
I spent so many sleepless nights pondering reasons why
Most of the good people in my life seem to die
See my eyes, take a look deep inside
Seek and find the bottom of my soul
Find a hole where my demons hide
All I want's a peaceful night, but I can't see it, why?
Every morning mom weeps and cries, so I don't even try
Still she teaches me right, stay humble and be polite
But she never saw what I saw on the streets at night
I just want to see the light
Raise the youth, feed my wife
But they're trying to take away my freedom so I need to fight
Redesign your feeble mind and read the signs, be advised
Either I get it or I'm taking what I feel is mine
Cause my life is like the best book you ever read
Spent nights listening to Westwood and getting vex
My pen writes when I'm depressed cause I never slept
Bread or step, lets do it man to man like Red and Meth
You can freestyle all day, I make the best songs
I'm like an insomniac's bed, can't be slept on
The open mics, you know that's where I got my rep from
Shady breadders thought they were big, but they were dead wrong
Rap for the spitter spitters, and spit for the rappers rappers
I rip the rythm to rythms from Britain to Madagascar
Listen to lyricists and I'll diss all the backwards acts and dismiss all the killing shit
Cause none of that crap should matter
Listen, listen
You know I'm right, go and find a rapper that's as real as this
He couldn't battle the flipping demons that I'm dealing with
Everybody says they're the hardest, but even if
You envy what I got and you want to swap, we can switch
Put on my Air Mac's and walk around a day in my shoes
Look at the bare facts and talk about paying my dues
You'd realize every bar that I'm saying is true
Phoning to cuss any DJ that ain't playing my tunes
In a drought, consider me the Guinness Stout
No I'm not the biggest or baddest but I'm the illest out
His bars might sound good when he spits 'em out
But would it mean something if you were looking at it written down?
Artist 'slash'/ terrorist
'Slash' Double P representative
'Slash' the worst rapper you could ever diss
'Slash' activist
'Slash' kidnapper of the president
Slash his wrist, leave a flipping slash where his temple is
Forget a crep-check, these brothers need their head checked
It's like they heard Dead Prez and went deaf
Only time they ever push weight is when they bench-press
When these DJs act like I don't exist I get vex
The pain I harbor burns like phosphorus rain on Gaza
They say I'm rather like Che Guevara or Sheikh Osama
But Sheikh Osama was Gates, Carter and Regan's partner
So we don't rate Osama and neither do we rate Obama
Cause more war more guns, that ain't the change we're after
They can ask to change the mask, it's still the same commander
I'm laying bars so razor sharp I could shave my barber

Daily Duppy yeah
