Intro [Lowkey]
Listen... the beast of the Middle East
Listen, yo

Verse One [Lowkey]
While little kids throw boulders at Israeli soldiers, you're at Marks and Spencer's buying Coca Cola
Donating the guns for these vulture's holsters
You don't even know you're involved, you jokers
I can't laugh my brother, it ain't funny
You say you don't support the beast, but you gave money
You see me, I won't contribute to the genocide
Whatever they try, Palestine will never die
So keep the road map, you're giving them billions to kill Palestinians and that's a known fact
How many children have to die in the streets before we put a stop to these Zionist beasts?
And Palestine's people can live well
Israel equals the U.S - the U.S equals Israel
They're funding this terror in the worst way
Welcome to Israel, the 51st state

Chorus [Stylah]
Star spangled banner
Side with the snakes
Big guns and big funds in U.S of A
Handshakes, the madness, the lies and the hate
Welcome to Israel, the 51st state

Verse 3 [Lowkey]
It's time for some action people, stop debating
Every single day they decrease the population
Inside out, it's an evil operation
Ask whoever you want, it's illegal occupation
America wants to pretend that they're helping the children, and they just give Israelis the weapons to kill them
They give them the tanks for wrecking the buildings
The facts always come to light, you can never conceal them
Even as I spit and record this people die and these Evangelical Christians support it
Forming an alliance with the Zionist lobby, while over here these spies are trying to stop me
We just want our people to live well
Israel equals the U.S - the U.S equals Israel
They're funding this terror in the worst way
Welcome to Israel - the 51st state

Chorus [Stylah]
Star spangled banner
Side with the snakes
Big guns and big funds in U.S of A
Handshakes, the madness, the lies and the hate
Welcome to Israel, the 51st state

Verse 4 [Wissam]
The bomb shells, the guns, and M16 planes
They kill mums and sons and still don't get blamed
The United States puts in a sniper - post slain
Kills a school girl, the world just watches - no shame
Israeli fighters should stop and be named with the stars and stripes on their cockpit main frames
Nuclear war heads aim to inflame, no prize just for guessing where those designs came
It ain't just occupation, it's M & S occupation, U.s supplication
Hate funded invasion of this location
State-run degradation of a nation
Book no vacations to this Hell
Israel equals the U.S - the U.S equals Israel
They fund mass murder in the worst way
Welcome to Is-Raheel the 51st state

Chorus [Stylah]
Star spangled banner
Side with the snakes
Big guns and big funds in U.S of A
Handshakes, the madness, the lies and the hate
Welcome to Israel, the 51st state
