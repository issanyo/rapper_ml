[Intro: Lowkey]
Yeah, I don't even know about this rapper thing anymore, man
I don't even know if I'm on this 'ting man, listen up!
It's not really me anymore, man...
Na'-what I mean? Yeah
Yeah!

[Verse 1: Lowkey]
Ever since eleven this rap shit meant, everything!
It was like the mic in my hand was a wedding ring
Don't get it twisted, it ain't my wife!
It's bigger than that at some point, it became my life!
Me and my friends used to argue over songs we'd preferred
As rappers back then, all we wanted, was to be heard
I'd spit for hours just to make sure you'd recognize
Hoping one-day I'd hear myself on 2-7-9
To tell the truth, I couldn't tell it was whack then
Cause everyone rapped in American accents. (Holla!)
But, still I wanted to blow in a hurry my friend
Looking back it's funny, Cuzzy, cause I was hungrier then!
We aimed to change the game, lyrically raise-the-bar
Take over the whole industry, make-it-ours!
Frequently I think about what this rap game means to me
But I can't lie (Can't lie), all of that changed recently...

[Hook: Doc Brown]
When you feel you've seen it all before
All the music ain't raw no-more
Feel to put the mic down [?]
Feel to put it down
When you bare your soul rapping a verse
And you gettin' nothing back in return, what's it worth?
Need to take some time out!
Feel to put it down, feel to put it down, feel to put it down
Feel to put it down, feel to put it down
Blud, I'm going crazy right now. Like, I'm breaking right-down
Need to take some time out, all the pain in my house, probably make me wile out
Feel to change my life around and
Place the mic down, come on!

[Verse 2: Lowkey]
Yo
I was a raw spitter, before an award winner
Before these fraudulent frauds were all in her
Maybe the fact is, this rap shit distracted me
Took away time I should of had with my family
I can go do a show, but then it's back to reality
Back to feeling alone and, trapped in insanity
Now I can hear myself when I tune into Choice
But, can't do fifty-minute shows without losing my voice!
I used to be so determined to earn respect!
Now I'm sitting here all messed up (Pfft!) a nervous wreck!
I haven't learnt my lessons (No!) I don't deserve success
It doesn't matter as long as when I'm gone, my words are left
I'm really only known truly by, certain heads
Excluding them, fuck what any other, person says! (Fuck 'em!)
'N fuck a psychiatrist, or psychologist
I don't need someone I don't know telling me what my problem is

[Hook: Doc Brown]
When you feel you've seen it all before
All the music ain't raw no-more
Feel to put the mic down [?]
Feel to put it down
When you bare your soul rapping a verse
And you gettin' nothing back in return, what's it worth?
Need to take some time out!
Feel to put it down, feel to put it down, feel to put it down
Feel to put it down, feel to put it down
Blud, I'm going crazy right now. Like, I'm breaking right-down
Need to take some time out, all the pain in my house, probably make me wile out
Feel to change my life around and
Place the mic down, come on!
