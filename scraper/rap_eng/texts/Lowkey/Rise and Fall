[Verse 1]
Back in the days, I had dreams of rapping on stage
Imagined listening to radio when my track would get played
Its tragic I never fathomed that the magic would fade
Lets take it back to the days when I established my name
I was over hungry for beats, like the melody was something to eat
Bars a 100 a week was nothing to me
Long as I had something deep to crush a sucker and see
I won battles but in a couple I fumbled; suffered defeats
I was grinding hard, way harder than other artists did
At 17 on Choice FM, I went bar for bar with Swiss
Lyrics for 45 minutes, ready and prepared
No lie, you can ask anybody that was there
Simple and plain my CD got critical acclaim
I began to build an official position in the game
Quicker than I could think I was fulfilling all my aims
I miss them days and now its difficult and shit isnt the same

[Hook]
Everything that goes up must come down
I was alright before, but Im fucked up now
Got a bit of success, didn't like it at all
Its time that I document my rise and my fall
If its not your destiny then its not meant to be
In the mirror face to face with my worst enemy
Got a bit of success, didn't like it at all
Its time that I document my rise and my fall

[Verse 2]
Before volume 2 dropped, my brother died
I never stopped I just carried on busting rhymes
Putting on a brave face but it was still tough at night
I Couldn't sleep, cos my nightmares were nothing nice
Volume 2 came out, got love in the press
Regardless, I was still stressed and fucking depressed
More successful, the more I felt stuck in a web
Pain ate away at my soul till nothing was left
There were rumours about, I heard the dirty sound
They even tried to say that chance has turned me down
Everyday they were on the phone tryna get me on that show
Till I had to tell them straight, look I didn't wanna go
But I didn't wanna blow, had nothing to prove brother
In '05 I won an award for best newcomer
But that shit's all irrelevant
They say the only thing worse than not getting what you wish for is getting it

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
I just can't handle the chinswagging and the lips chatting
My issues have me making decisions to quit rapping
Its funny (why) cos that almost really did happen
I changed my mind everyday, kept zigzagging
But Im a lyricist, I live for this, I tried to stop
Got volume 3 of my chest and hit writers block
Very pissed, I was getting sick of my topics
A pad and paper, I couldn't fill a line of it
Seeing rappers in magazines, I know Im better then
Cussing has-beens when really Im just a never-been
Me and my clique would be rich if we were American
Those negative times are so clear when I remember them
I hope you heard a bar you can maybe relate with
Life is strange, it never remains the same; it changes
It wasn't just memories that made me make this
Cause we all rise and fall on a daily basis
