[Verse: Lowkey]
Ay yo it's Poisonous, we're poised to bust
So boisterous that boydem are avoiding us
Hard to reach that Toys 'R' Us
Starting beef is pointless, cuz
Represent crooks like a lawyer does
About to flood the underground like somebody's boiler's bust
Killers lyrically with ill ability
Village idiots grilling me
We envision the bigger picture differently
Written history
The sickest lyricist killing it in the industry
In the streets we're ripping it particularly
Double P, any trouble
Get left as rubble under me
Suffered a couple fuckery
Luckily it must've toughened me
On the hunt but we hustle to double our bundle subtly
It's lovely jubbly even though the struggle's stuck in me
There's a great abundance of haters in London
Layton to Sutton
Making the assumption you're raking the funds in
And they're patiently pacing and hunting
Waiting for something so they can raid your drum
Take your mum and whack her face with a gun
And that's the way that they function
It ain't safe in the dungeon
You could get blazed like a Bunsen
Plus there's Jakes with their truncheons
And racists at customs
Ready to break your face if you punch them
It's basically fucked
You better watch who you're placing your trust in
Can't even blaze with your cousin
Braids get brave when it's blatant your bud's in
Change your fate with a razor blade over nothing
Bare frustration and fussing, no debates or discussion
There's dangerous strangers aiming flamers and busting
Plus watch what lady you nut in
Cause the dame that you're crushing
Could have..... bacon in the oven
There's snakes making names, laying claims
Chasing paper and fronting
Praying about playing the game
Satan is running whenever I rhyme on the beat
I bless it right properly
I recognize honesty
You're telling lies probably
Never try stopping me
When I'm in the hood like meals on wheels and ethnic minorities
Forget buying designer attire
I'm writing this fire 'til these liers resign and retire
Got the type of mind Einstein would admire
Tighter than a Mayan's vagina
But I'm here if you biters need a writer to hire
Iron mic, spits the dynamite you'd like to acquire
Need firefighters' saliva just to survive in this cypher
Recite the messiah
Time to fight with the tiger
Likely to find me flying to China
I recently had beef with some demons that dreamed of eating me
Like pizza or a piece of meat, I deleted them easily
Please believe me, G
There's a deeper meaning to being free
Legally, read and see the freedom that we can reach
I'm teaching teachers teaching me
Preaching to people peacefully
Don't smoke needlessly cause, weed weakens me
And being mean just feeds the beast, mean machine
They don't feed the needy
But they're eager and keen to keep the greedy queen
I told my sister reach her dreams
Be everything that she can be
They want us as feeble fiends
Reason being they keep the cream
It's an evil scheme
Police on the beat peeping me
Life is deep
But we need a leader to lead the weak
You're own people will leave you deceased like Caesar
See, it seems to me
That they don't wanna see our seeds succeed
Ends need to meet, so I'm on the streets seeking P's
Cause this is what I breathe and eat
Look deep, can you see the pain in my eyes?
Do you think you can relate to the state of my mind?
I need to lay it all out, cause I'm aching inside
But I know this pain will stay 'til the day that I die
I take a deep breath and step outside
It could be me next
Whatever comes, I stay ever ready to meet death
So stressed, waking up in cold sweats
I need rest
It's messed up, how dark and disturbing my dreams get
Little kids that died, covered in flies, with ribs touching
Corporations that saw them nations, but did nothing
Governments are puppets for billon dollar companies
Sooner or later, the killers are gonna come for me
When I think about the truth, I feel so sick
Even if you're egnorant, fam, there's still no bliss
The roads are brainwashed and you will note this
They put fiberglass in the weed and brothers still smoked it
You think you're hard, but they're laughing at us
You think you know, but it's larger than parliament, cause
We're not even free when our hits are sitting on the shelf
The lyrics that you're spitting in your songs, you're just snitching on yourself
You think what you do is making it better?
I'm not trying to open your mind
I'm trying to change it forever
But probably above all, I embody the struggle
Of everybody that hustles and I ain't sorry for fuck all
I refuse to be a product of the place that I live in
Never playing the villain with what I say on the rhythm
They molded us from day, how didn't we know?
Demons are starting at my soul and they're killing me slow
Will I make it to tomorrow? I can't tell
But I know I've gotta free all of my brothers from this dark hell
Everything I spit is heartfelt
The ink that I'm using to write is what I get when my heart melts
You need more than a 64 to outflow me
Tell me, what's this whole scene without Lowkey?
That's like football without Pele
That's like chess without checkmate
Or L.A. without eses
That's like crack and coke without addicts
Or like Ladbroke Grove without Arabs
That's like the fresh beats without an MC
That's like this scene without Grime Daily or SB
Don't be greedy boys
And stop acting hard if you're really moist
I'm like the industry hater without the mask and the neeky voice
Ya done know, big up SB
