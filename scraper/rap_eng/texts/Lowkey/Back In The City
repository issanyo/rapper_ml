Back in the city
Where I belong
Back in the city
Girl are you home
Back in the city
Girl are you alone
Back in the city
Relationship status unknown

Back in the city she asked what's that cologne
Back in the city I feel like Capone or Sean combs
Cause I'm the man in charge
Distance between me and you has gotten large
Cause you doing you
I been doing me
You happy
And that's all i wanna see
You got a new nigga Ima let you be
Just know that there is no we
Cause you fucked up
And I lucked up
I told my brother these hoes never loved us
Never loved us
Never had trust
Never had love
Just had lust but
