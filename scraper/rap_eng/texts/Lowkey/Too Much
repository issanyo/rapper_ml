[Intro: Lauryn Hill]
If you down with the rich man, and that can be rich in anything
Don't you take too much
If you laugh at a poor man, and that can be poor in anything
Don't you laugh too much
If you trying to be rich man, and that can be rich in anything
Don't you take too much
And if you need to be needed, and you're looking for purpose
Just remember, don't you need too much...

[Hook: Shadia Mansour]
If you take something you, don't need, and keep it
Then you've stolen from somebody else who's hungry
Everything that you do, is everything you are
Everything that I am, is everything you'll ever need

[Verse 1: Lowkey]
Money can buy power, but it can't buy respect
Money can't buy sleep, but it can buy a bed
Money can't buy you love, but it can buy sex
Do you posses money or by money are you possessed?
Money can buy a house, but it can't buy a home
So even with money you still feel all alone
Money can buy you friends, but it can't buy family
Money can't make you happy, that's just a fallacy
It can buy a bath, but it can't buy purity
It can buy bodyguards, but it can't buy security
While people around the world starve, I eat
Cause money can buy war, but it can't buy peace
Some do everything and anything to get the p's
The society we living in, it's a necessity
It's got the power to turn your best friends to enemies
It's funny cause money doesn't follow us when we leave

[Hook: Shadia Mansour]

[Verse 2: Lowkey]
Does happiness live in a mansion with a swimming pool?
I know people with plenty of money that are miserable
We all need to earn in this world we live
Most work for it, some steal, but many worship it
Some sell poison for it, some seek employment for it
We need it to survive, so some clean the toilets for it
I need papes to live but never will I live for papes
Abolish the Queen, I don't wanna see that witch's face
Many sell their soul for it, no not me
Some will try to tell you that it doesn't grow on trees
I heard the saying said, many a time, but they were wrong
Cause if it doesn't tell me then where do you get the paper from?
Most think they will be happy if they only had more of it
Some waste it, some feel more important because they're born with it
Some have got the nerve to say you're fraudulent for forging it
The truth is you don't need a fortune to be fortunate

[Hook: Shadia Mansour]
