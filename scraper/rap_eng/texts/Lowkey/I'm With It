[Intro]

Yeah
I like this one
Yeah
Lowkey
Feli's Friday

[Chorus]

I've been thinking bout you for a minute
And I ain't seen you in a minute
I've been thinking bout you

Girl I'm with it, if you with it
Girl I'm with it, if you with it, then I'm with it

[Verse 1]:

Got the King ring and I'm fresh as fuck
Other ring and I'm fresh as fuck
Black rims on my first whip
No doubt feeling fresh as fuck
NASA stuntin'
My bomber jacket is the bomb know I ain't frontin'
I had to put it in a song, no that I ain't stuntin'
Young Jesus came on, know that I was bumpin'
Yeah yeah
She's cuter with her hair up
She's just told me I look good I just finished my hair cut
I just told her she look good, she said she looks a mess-uh
I just told her ride with me, I just wanna de-stress her
Uh
Something to eat
I know that you're hungry you ain't fooling me
Take a long walk tho there's not much to see
But it's all good cause you're all that I need to see
No I ain't tryna run game
But these things happen, is all I'm saying
And these things happen, cause we've been craving
And these these cravings, are slowly fading



[Chorus](x2)


[Verse 2]:

You ain't gotta be here for me in my darkest hours
But I might pull up just to visit we can share what's ours
It's you and me, all this sexual chemistry
A bag of weed, ain't a smoker that ain't guaranteed
Soft kisses, no misses, just blisses, I miss it ...
Yeah yeah
Soft kisses, no mister, just blisses, you miss it...
Jokes on deck
Fuck around and kiss your neck
Fuck around a kiss what's next
Figure out just what comes next
I could make your dreams come true like a Celebi
I could make your downstairs change how the weather be
Biting on your lip
Don't hold back you're taking the piss
Baby maybe we should strip
Follow me to the back of the whip
Hit the right coordinates, and sink you like a battle ship
Hit the right coordinates, and sink you like a battle ship

UH
