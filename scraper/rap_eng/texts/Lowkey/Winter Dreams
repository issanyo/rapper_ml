[Verse 1: Haze]
(Here’s a message to the newborns)
I’ve seen a lot of nights turned cold in my winter dreams
Within the realest picture vision what the feeling means
The same feeling that I feel and try to feed the dream
The same reason there’s a reason for it reason being
Being that I’m chosen see I've always seen the deepest scheme
Real life
I’m enlightened I can feel the deen
But on the other side flip that
We be on the rotag
Really trying to get that
Bunnin’ on the spliff chilling sitting why arrest that?
Life that we live see you gotta watch your head back
Righteous
I ain’t living right but I’m blessed that
Nigga on the run
Eatin’ like I come from LeFrak
I can see an angel and a devil in a death match
My soul’s tied to the most highest blessed that
Through my winter dreams
I can see the light
It’s freezing cold
But the morning's bright

[Skit: Charles Chaplin]
I don’t want to be an emperor
That’s not my business
I don’t want to rule or conquer anyone
I should like to help everyone if possible
Jew, gentile, black man, white
But we have lost the way
Greed has poisoned mens’ souls

[Verse 2: Lowkey]
(Here’s a message to the newborns)
I say death to the empire and debt to China
Conquerors on a conquest the best divide us
Dying economically
But the impact is cultural
Sit back I rip tracks spit facts and quotables
Spitting's an addiction
Like whiskey to Christopher Hitchens
But I’m here on a particular mission
Got strangers praying for the death of me
Dangerous like Israelis with race specific weaponry
Not afraid of the weather never cave to the pressure
Do you love your people or hate your oppressor?
Consumed by the pain I will carry till I’m gone
Or they switch off the machine next to Ariel Sharon
I was never sold the lies we were told to buy
I wonder what’s the real reason that Diana and Dodi died
They never gave citizenship to that old Arab
Can’t be part of the family even if you own Harrods
Here’s a message to the newborns
Can’t be part of the family even if you own Harrods
