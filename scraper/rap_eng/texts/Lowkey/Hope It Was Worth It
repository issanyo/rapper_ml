[Intro: Kurri Official]

Oh yeah (7x)

She did me dirty yeah



[Chorus: Makai Raymond]

Tell me if its worth it

Tell me baby girl was it worth it

Was it worth it

Was it worth it

Tell me baby girl was it worth it

(Repeat)



[Verse 1: Kurri Official]

You could tell me anything

And I'd believe

So naive

My trap queen is you

My trap queen was you

Telling me I was your man

Clarifying saying yes I am

Didn't realize why yo phone would be buzzing

Goin' outside must be ya cousin

Ah I was wrong

Took too long

He was coming round

And I'm just sitting down

Like what who are

Why

Sitting here thinking bout what you said

Wishing iMessage didn't say read

I shouldn't have to live with knowing you love him

Hold up no deal ah but

Can't you see I'm focused on the music

Gon' head girl cause you blew it

Do you take back what you said since I'm making moves

This is not chess but if we played you'd lose

And yes I see that you've been hitting my line

What a lost cause trynna make up lost time

I'm nobody's golden ticket to fame

So right now girl get in ya lane

I'm talking foreal

I'm incapable of feeling what you feel

But ima be ok

Ima be all right

This message you've sent for me to read

Supposedly my ride or die

But you didn't even put up a fight

So tell me baby



[Chorus: Makai Raymond]

Tell me if its worth it

Girl tell me if its worth it

Tell me if its worth it

Girl tell me if its worth it



[Verse 2: Makai Raymond]

Look goin' through the same ole shit

Remind me of my old ass chick

He was really being real w/  chu

Prolly even run a mile for you

Wasn't even playing games w/ chu

Damn he really had a thing for you

All he wanted was the same from you

Said you never do him dirt

And you claiming you different from other right

Give you real satisfaction

I guess that was nothin' you wanted right

You get kicked to the curb

And niggas don't even really know it

He really wanna fuck w/ chu

But you only wanna mess for the moment

Look I'm tired of playing these games w/ chu girl

I'm tired of playing these games w/ chu

There's nothing a nig-- can really do

The only thing I can say to you



[Outro: Makai Raymond]

Girl I hope it was worth it

Thought we was so perfect

Never thought you was worthless girl

Girl I never thought you was worthless

Damn

Goddamn (2x)

Yuh (3x)

Goddamn
