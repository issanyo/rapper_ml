[Intro]
Niggas is bitter, they heard us
Look at the business merge
(Sneak dissing!)

[Hook]

They was bitter all along
Thats shit I don't condone
I'm the real, you a clone
But I'll flex for these hoes
Cause look how far we come
Mom and dad was never home
Turn around and they gone
I had to get it on my own


[Verse 1]

And I'd love to have to be the one to do it
Getting everything thats coming to ya
I'm Southside - I'll run up on you like John Gotti
Hard Body - Clap back, clap to the music
After 5, we the only movement making any movement
My bitch as pretty as she money-loving
Campaign on Tom Hanks, and I'm still running
I came up with the only nigga in the whole thang kept it 100
CloneFree? Who gives a fuck
Don't Runaway, just run it up
Ya'll niggas not really running
Just sit back - You might learn something
Gave em plays, they got in the way
They not business-made
Can't catch up when this rap shit that I ventilate
Like 900 on the interstate
Niggas swear they getting paid - Paid for views, skip the stage
I'm tryna get my niggas on Pay-Per-View in fifty states
They shit like REALLY played - Mine hit like John White
Mayweather, nothing nice - Killing off that weak shit
Drake-ing off that Meek shit - I'll give it a week, yeah

[Hook]

They was bitter all along
Thats shit I don't condone
I'm the real, you a clone
But I'll flex for these hoes
Cause look how far we come
Mom and dad was never home
Turn around and they gone
I had to get it on my own

[Verse 2]

They was bitter all along
Thats shit I dont condone
I'm the real you a clone
But I'll flex for these hoes
Cause look how far I came - Just doing my thing
And these niggas so lame - Stay the fuck in yo lane
Work hard til I'm sore - Workin harder than before
Gettin money, need yours
Stack chips and I dip
Told ya'll we on tip - Bitches reading my lips
Want me all in they mouth - Got em talking my shit
Fuck models, eat shrip - Cream soda my scrip
Niggas thinking I pimp, I might walk with a limp
Should've off that in 06
I don't sneak when I diss
I ain't sneak you back then
I'm on 4 block - what it is?

[Bridge]

I'm so south jack with my niggas twistin fingers
Gangbangers, big chiefers
Do you smell me?
Can you see me?
Uh-uh

[Outro]
