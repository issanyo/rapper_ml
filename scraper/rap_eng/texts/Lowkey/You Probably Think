[MIA - Paper Planes beat]

Verse 1

I don’t sell drugs, and no I’ve never been shot
Stop thinking you know what is and isn’t hiphop
No Im not a cockney though my home is London
Please, look past all your own assumptions
You reckon it’s all bitches and hoes then you’re an ignorant bloke
Don’t understand so you think it’s a joke
Negativity is not what Im glamourising
Listen with your heart, stop sitting there analysing
Broaden your mind, stop sitting there patronising
Take that smirk off your face when you hear a rapper rhyming
And stop believing the hype see it deep in the mind
Seek and you'll find people are just people in life
You don’t wanna, witness what the kids spit
You'd rather dismiss it as misogynistic
I know great rappers from Margate to Manchester
So please spare me the embarrassing hand gestures

CHORUS

All I wanna do is
*Gunshots*
And take your money

You probably think
All I wanna do is
*Gunshots*
And take your money

I bet you think
All I wanna do is
*Gunshots*
And take your money

You probably think
All I wanna do is
*Gunshots*
And take your money

But you're wrong

Verse 2

I never been to jail but I’ve been to University
Don’t take it personally certain journalists are _
Don’t sell drugs, I perform poetry and earn a fee
You look down but one day your son might work for me
Hip-hop is universal, take time think on it
Don’t own a car, let alone one with rims on it
You wanna hear rappers? There’s tons from London, In fact
None of us rap about the guns and the crack
’cos that is not hip-hop and they know it
Forget the word rapper, we’re just modern day poets
We make the points, that you perverse jerks never make
Don’t wanna break the change, you'd rather perpetuate
You must have a very closed mind
If you can’t see past all the stereo-types
If you know a hater, reveal them
Don’t worry about me, just watch which rappers are raising your children

CHORUS (x2)

All I wanna do is
*Gunshots*
And take your money

You probably think
All I wanna do
*Gunshots*
And take your money

I bet you think
All I wanna do
*Gunshots*
And take your money

You probably think
All I wanna do
*Gunshots*
And take your money

But you're wrong
All I wanna do
*Gunshots*
And take your money
