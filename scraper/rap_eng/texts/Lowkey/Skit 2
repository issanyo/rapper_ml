Dear friends, I think it's now, time to at least have a first balance sheet, not the last, the first balance sheet of the Obama presidency
As many of you know the images of the campaign are still vivid
Big, large mobilizations in the United States, of young people primarily, desperate for change
And the slogan of that campaign: Change We Can Believe In"
Change Change Change
But what has changed and what hasn't changed
There has been of course been a change in the presidency, and we can't complain too much about that (Laughter)
There is a new vice-president also in the United States, and we can't complain too much about that (Laughter and Applause)
But the Defence Secretary is the same. That's the guy who sits in the pentagon and organizes wars, and the reason he was kept on was to show that there is, there are both elements of discontinuity at the top AND very strong elements of continuity
And the reason for that, is that if you wear Caesar's clothes, you have to behave like Caesar
