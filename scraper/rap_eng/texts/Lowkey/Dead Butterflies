Pre-hook:/
I almost fell for your lies
Till I looked deep inside your eyes
I could feel it through our vibes
You no longer wanted to be mine

Hook:/
Stomach full of dead butterflies (x4)

Verse1:/
Shawty got me trippin
Got me pill poppin to kill the feelin
Bout to make me turn into a villain
Grab the suppressor from the dresser
And put another clip in
These drugs give me dark visions
They got me thinkin a little different
Makin quick split decisions to whether
I should kiss your throat or slit it
Got me feelin like ted bundy to these women
Let me get formal, imma act normal
Then imma fuck you, then imma record it
Smash your head in, take you to the forest
Then imma fuck you again act like it was nothin
Then imma nut on the butterflies in your stomach
