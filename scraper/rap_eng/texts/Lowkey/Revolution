Little man never did exams
Got a particular bigger plan flipping grams
When a bigger man in his gang gave him a stick to bang
Or maybe just hold 'cos no one thought he would kill a man
Till he caught a silly billy villain, chilling in the jam
Sipping cham’ spliff in his hand trigger didn’t jam
Bang bang biddy bang biddy biddy bang
Now he's in the can thinking damn what a pity fam
Rappers are yapping and flapping their lips
Bout how they're packing and clapping their sticks
Has to be big
The impact it has on the kids, tells me where the factory is
The government kill, they're just stacking their chips
You wonder why the yout dem are strapped and their pissed
If not a nine, it's a knife getting jabbed in your ribs
People die for the petrol and gas in our whip
In London, you can get shanked in the heart
Still the government put more tanks in Iraq
Ignorant little spitters are talking greezy
Cos they bitten bits that the saw on TV
If all you rap about is the hoes and the doe
It's already too late, you sold 'em your soul
You jokers act like you know but you don't
'Cos there's little kids dying all over the globe

They used to beat my lights out and nights out
And days in spent blazing
Didn't help me to navigate ways through the mazes
But why now it's right out amazing to think
Now let the revolutionaries sing
Stand up for your rights and fight for revolution
Free your mind and so ignite constitution
'Cos they're killing us all...

Little man never did exams
He be chillin with his fam in a flat
Spliff in hand and spittin raps
But there's more than one way to skin a cat
Gotta make up for the things he didn't have
Wanna be a dan
Little mans gott bigger plans
Wanna be bigger than jigga and killer cam
Picture that while hes sittin back sippin out a guinness can
Feelin trapped
Done with the chitter chat!
Little man dealing crack for a bit of cash
Put his shit on smash, buildin’ stacks
Livin isnt bad
Untill a cat got in his flat
And hit him with a bat
And they found where he hid his stash
Little man fouled it
Get him back
Now really mad
Feelin militant put on his timberlands and headed to the flat
Where the cats that had jacked him were chillin at
‎Bowl full of gas in his gaff
And lit a match
Put it in a bad
And away it goes BANG!
But the cat's whole family was in the flat
Now it’s definitely defo prison for little man
He could of been one in a million he could've had the whole world in his hands
But shit hit the fan
When the cat came back
With his strap
Pulled the trigger back
Finished little man in a flash
Its a FACT!
That he's dead now....
