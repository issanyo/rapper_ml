[Verse 1:Lowkey]

This is my medium
Cause medium murdered reality
Count downs begun
Feel the change coming closer
Fires been burning for years
Soon its gonna bubble over
And you wonder why there's underlying and anger
When you use our taxes for bombs and subsidising bankers
Ignore the clock that you can't hear﻿ the time ticking
Spend your life football watching﻿ bet placing pint sipping
Look at the world like its all a movie
Learn to blow a wogs brains out on call of duty
Be a lazy consumer that plays his computer
Unaware of the little boy that made you your pumas
And the one eyed two headed babies of Fallujah
And the patriotic bomb makers that gave him the tumor
Lead a one man
Revolution from your arm chair
Talking cliches to listeners that aren't there
You call it warfare, but your wars aren't fair
If they were, there would be suicide bombers in arm fairs
Still trying to understand the land I stand on
I'll probably die from cancer...
Whats the reason for your name and your where about's?
Who dictates what you should and shouldn't care about?
Death to the empire, and death to China
Conquerors on a conquest, the best dividers
Dying economically but the impact is cultural
Sit back, I spit raps, spit facts and quotables
Spitting is an addiction, like whiskey to Christopher Hitchen's
But I'm here on a particular mission
I got strangers praying for the death of me
Dangerous like west race pacific weaponry
This is not the United Nations, but we unite the the nations
I'm trying to find some righteous brave man to fight the masons
Here come five of the greatest out of hibernation, to try and save this dying race before annihilation
Were actually......
Attackers get bow splattered
Gagged and bows captured
Think our men can't fight, to defend our rights
My sword sends scars when charged at Templar Knights
Cause, Karma can't make love like Kama Sutra
These are sharp shooters, I'm not Gandhi or Martin Luther
Your subordinate to corporate to a guy supplying you orders
Your fighting fire with fire, I'm fighting fire with water
The policies supremacy, equality is the enemy
It honestly astonishes me, they wanna see the end of me
The elite narrative, they're seeking the damages
Delete and deceased and the people that challenge it
Eye of the tiger, cause I'm a survivor
My rhymes a reminder from china to Naija
We all are humanity, the poor of reality brings us all back to the cause of calamity
The better, the worst, the pure attainted
The death, the birth, the torture it came with
Inferior, superior, the thoughts of racist
No knowledge of land while they walk on the pavement
Saying 9/11 in chile, thats a different day
When the CIA back peniche, they innovate different ways they can kill an slay
Is this Great Britain? Cause tell me, whats makes Britain great?
If your from Diego Garicia, Britain isn't very great
Many children from that place for a military base, and they can't go back cause there isn't any space
And the bombs kept there, turn to killings everyday
So where's the equality, where's the humanity
No news on it, can't stare at the tragedy
Children with siblings, parents with families, it comes down to it, your in fear of the gravity
A rearrange big change in the policy, the enemy's supremacy, the change is equailty
