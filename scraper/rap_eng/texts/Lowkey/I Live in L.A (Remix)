(Verse 1: King K)
Okay, Okay
Diamonds brighter than the sun in broad day
Wrist cold like I had it in the freezer all day
Call me Mr.Steal Your Girl don't say
That I didn't warn a nigga from the moment I came

(Verse 2: Bri-C)
Iced out, imma pull up right now (Right now)
Money counter I just listen to them sounds (To the sounds)
Big bank stack tall to them clouds (To the clouds)
See me swerving I be lurking for my crown (Hey ya)

(Verse 3: King K)
Call me King K, the first
Pull up on me best prepare, for worst
I'm repping TNC all on my shirt
I got your hoe on my plate, dessert

(Verse 4: Bri-C)
Aye, look
I'm trynna pull up in the Benzo
Or the Range Rove
I be saucing everyday hoe
Flexing so impressive every single time I change clothes
Then I change flows get paid check my bankrolls

(Verse 5: King K)
Thankful Thankful talent on a mill
Trynna cop a rollie with some diamonds and a grill
Oh I got an attitude? Put it on the bill
Can't apologize for flexing y'all can call it overkill

(Verse 6: Bri-C)
What
Overkill
Every track I'm on I drill
Diamonds steady looking glossy Fiji water when I spill
Every check I run it up I fuck it up you know the deal
I'm speaking shit into existence just to keep it on the real

(Verse 7: King K)
Pull up in a Rari same color as my president
Orange
Girl on my hip she a dime she foreign
My team look fly yeah I know we soaring
King K, Bri-C next summer we touring

(Verse 8: Bri-C)
Aye, Look, Aye
Them windows tinted fuck a drop top
Never pop drop but you know I got this game locked
I been a finesser since the day I been awake (HA)
Man they really love me trynna tour a couple states
Seizing every moment Carpe Diem when I wake
Fall, Summer, Winter, Spring, everyday I'm chasing cake
Yeah, Yeah, Yeah I got the drip
Looking something like a lake
Then I wake up then I do this no I never take a break

(Verse 9: King K)
Y'all probably sleep on my talent
Never be on my status
Nigga while you're acting crazy I'll be here living lavish
Ray Bans on my face
Bands round my waist
Wanna know where I'm from I just tell'em outerspace

(Verse 10: Bri-C)
Look
Rollie I be flexing on this track I be finessing
Never travelled with a tooly never had the Smith & Wesson
But see if you got a problem I'm advising for discretion
We get violent out here nigga I ain't worried never stressing
Pull up on the block
Pull up in a drop
Gave that nigga two pieces I ain't talking Wingstop
Want that rollie for my wrist so a nigga finna pop
Why you focused on my riches why you niggas gonna flop
Aye

(Bridge & Outro)
Look
Bitch I'm living in L.A aye
Look
Bitch I'm headed to L.A aye
Look
Bitch I'm living in L.A what
Aye
Bitch we living in L.A
