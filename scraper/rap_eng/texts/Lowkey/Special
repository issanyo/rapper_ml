If you don't respect yourself, no one's gonna respect you
If you don't love yourself, no one's gonna love you

It's a special kind of love, a very special kind of love
A very very special kind of love, yeah
It's a special kind of love, a special kind of love
A very very special kind of love

[Verse 1]

First verse go's out to the girls, be proud of yourself
But don't just take pride in your outer shell
They take mens advances for granted
Cause it's common that we bother them
Thats why so many young women can't take a compliment
You'd probably get put off if I called you
And probably get turned on if I ignored you
Make up caked up to cover up whats under there
All your facebook friends see pics of you in your underwear
He treats you like a princess, your not impressed
The truth is you'd probably like him more if he did less
You change the colour of your hair and the colour of your eyes
When will you realise that this stuff is a diguise
I sympathise certainly, seeing Jordan on tv mentally legitimise surgery
You'll only be truly loved by someone else, when you learn to respect and to love yourself

It's a special kind of love, a very special kind of love
A very very special kind of love, yeah
It's a special kind of love, a special kind of love
A very very special kind of love
It's a special kind of love, a very special kind of love
A very very special kind of love, yeah
It's a special kind of love, a special kind of love

[Verse 2]

Second verse go's out to the males of the species
The ones who've got different women for each week
What's next? i'll break down the player complex
And tell you what the motive behind it is cause it's not sex
Most people at some point got their heart broke
Misery loves company some people just can't cope
A man that hops beds cause he's scared to sleep alone
Is the same as a loose women that can't keep 'em closed
Your both in the same boat, this is what you need to know
A man gets called a player, as for the woman she's a ho
The truth is they both are insecure people trying to mend their broke hearts
If you brag that you've slept with thousands of girls
All that tells me is that you don't value yourself
You'll only be truly loved by someone else, when you learn to respect and to love yourself

It's a special kind of love, a very special kind of love
A very very special kind of love, yeah
It's a special kind of love, a special kind of love
A very very special kind of love
It's a special kind of love, a very special kind of love
A very very special kind of love, yeah
It's a special kind of love, a special kind of love
