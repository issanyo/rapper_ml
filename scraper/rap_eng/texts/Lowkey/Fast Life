[Verse 1: Lowkey]
My first years on this earth
As a young boy swapping fun toys gave me some joy
At that age simple things made me happy
Potty training starting, mum changing nappys
Approaching puberty, body changing already
Satan had me
Becoming a teenager
Growing up to need paper, just to stop fucking with cheap trainers
Dreaming of a house where I won't see neighbours
In a garden thats a whole three acres
I was running the streets
Getting invites, now my tounge in a beat is my weapon in life
Caught in the stress and the strife
I learnt theres a thin line between your flesh and a knife
Your heart and a bullet
Defeat was hard but I took it
Like a man
Before I learnt to crawl I tried to stand
With just a mic in hand
I shine without designer brands leavin' psychis prang
Scared to fight the champ
Im not the highest rank, not with a title
Still better than your popular idols
Certain people wanna stop my survival
What i've seen is shocking and frightful
Lowkey and rap go together like God and the Bible
