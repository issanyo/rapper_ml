[Verse 1: Logic]
You see cause these are my last words
I've embedded my heart into this song so I hope every bar's heard
Before I go I hope to get to speak to Nas first
Ask him why he sold out
See if his heart hurts
In my name build one church and one mosque
There's different ways of worship but there's only one God
I hope people like that I speak straight
And to my family my Mum most of all I appreciate
More than you can ever think
I love you for everything
And to my foes that I've fought in my past
Cause everybody has made me
Without it I wouldn't have lasted through half
Society was never able to mould me
I wanna shout-out to everyone who can say that they know me
See cause this is what I leave you
An immaculate piece of art for my people to see truth
I hope freemasonry is abolished
I hope the chosen one rises just like the Qur'an has promised
I hope Jesus Christ returns
I hope corrupt politicians are made to burn
Cause how will they ever learn
Without being force fed?
Listen, imagine every gun they pump into the system for us pawns
We build our own army and reform
Re-unite; my last words are for a positive fight. (Yeah)
So if I die I can say that
I was able to write and leave my fans with a last quote
I sit back and sip my last brandy and light up my last smoke
See these words that I give you now see they're my last hope
I'm nearly 25 I'm feeling like I've missed the last boat
But I don't care and I quote yours sincerely, Logical, Cigol

[Verse 2: Lowkey]
See these are my last words
I'm grateful for the life that I lived cause it could have
Been far worse my scars are burning I feel like my path's cursed
But remember me for teaching people that can't learn
Remember me for what I did surrounded by negativity did my best
To be positive I spoke for those that can't speak remember that
After my last breath and my heart's last beat I stayed strong
And never preyed on the weak never snaked my friends
Never changed for the P's these are my last words
While I pray on my knees thank you for my life I'm so grateful
Believe I turned my back on my brother to learn the meaning of love
If everything goes to plan I will see him above with enemies I ain't
Keeping a grudge cause most people are deceitful and it's easy to judge
With my dying breath I let them know that I tried my best till that
Organ stops beating inside my chest I gave 100 percent with every rhyme
I said but it's not right living life this stressed after the last beat of
My heart you better believe that I'm leaving my mark and I might
Never see my cd in the chart but inshallah my seed can see peace in Iraq
I apologize to the people I hurt It's so hard to explain because
It's so hard to explain because it's deeper than words but when
I'm 6 feet deep in the dirt make sure every word that I'm speaking
Is heard when I die please don't mourn cry not for me when I die
Please don't cry write a song for me remember what I did right and
What I did wrong don't say rest in peace help me live on

The last statement of James Connolly
We went out to break the connection between this country and the british
Empire and to establish an Irish republic we believe that the call we thus
Issued to the people of Ireland was a holier calling and a holier
Cause than any call issued to them during this war having any connection
With The war we succeeded in proving that irishmen are ready to die
Endeavoring to win for Ireland their national rights which the british
Government has been asking Then to die to win for Belgium as long as that
Remains the case the cause Of Irish freedom is safe believing that the british
Government has no Right Ireland never had any right in Ireland and never can have any right in Ireland
