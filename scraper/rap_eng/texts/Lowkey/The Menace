[Hook: Mongrel]
Fundamentally, you’re a fundamentalist
Kinda guy who wonderin' who the real terror is
You’re a menace, You’re a credit to none
Electoral eclipse of your morals, son

[Verse 1: Lowkey]
Religions are made evil, the way that we twist ‘em
OK, so now this warmongerer claims to be a Christian
That’s False. You see it if you only look:
Money’s religion, and TV’s the holy book
If he’s Christian, then Christians are getting a bit crazier
He should know Iraq was once called Mesopotamia
They tell a lot of lies that are hard to believe in
‘Cos Mesopotamia was the Garden of Eden
Systematically sadistic, sicker than sickle-cell
"Christians" couldn't turn the Garden of Eden to living hell
Kill women and children, claiming they’re not civilians
Get on the TV and start brainwashing millions
Using innocent lives that died in them buildings-
To get soldiers to fight, but doesn’t want that life for his children
Hypocrite, a killer with the covenant of sinner
Governor of Government? Just a puppet on a string
Terrorism? Take look in a good mirror
Beat around the bush, I’m a Bush whacker, Bush killer
Don’t believe it, even though some sheeple do
They wouldn’t hate you if you didn’t give them a reason to
You say justice but that’s just a lie
Religion’s not the reason - just the way they justify
You’re a terrorist, giving birth to another terrorist
The fact is fundamentally that you’re the fundamentalist

[Hook: Mongrel]
Fundamentally, you’re a fundamentalist
Kinda guy who wonderin' who the real terror is
You’re a menace, You’re a credit to none
Electoral eclipse of your morals, son
They didn’t have no guns and the war's not won
Electoral eclipse of your morals, son

[Verse 2: Lowkey]
This one’s for Kosovo, Iraq, Palestine, Chechnya
All those who passed in 9/11 in America
Afghanistan, Kashmir, Bosnia and Darfur
It’s in our nature as the human race to start war
Congo, Somalia, Eritrea, Rwanda
Lebanon, Liberia, Serbia and Uganda
Around the world, too many children deaded in vain
I won't carry on ‘cos there’s too many to name

[Hook: Mongrel]
Fundamentally, you’re a fundamentalist
Kinda guy who wonderin' who the real terror is
You’re a menace, You’re a credit to none
Electoral eclipse of your morals, son
Four lucky young guns done london
An Electoral eclipse of your morals, son

[Verse 3: Lowkey]
Whether you from Battersea or Basra, From Oman or Canada
From Aberdeen or Africa. Camden or Addis Ababa
I do this for the mothers and daughters without running water
And the brothers tortured in lawless wars that leave countries slaughtered
You say justice well that’s just a lie
Religion’s not the reason - just the way they justify
You’re a terrorist, giving birth to another terrorist
The fact is fundamentally that you’re the fundamentalist
