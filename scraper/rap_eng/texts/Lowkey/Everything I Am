[Hook]
Everything I am, and everything I want to be
I put it in your hands, you could open up to me
Everything I am, and everything I want to be
I put it in your hands, you could open up to me
Oh don't we ever get beyond this wall

[Verse 1]
I am no role model, I am not Mr. Perfect
Been bitten a couple of times and I did deserve it
Everyday livin' and learnin' through these written verses
My life is a sacrifice, I wonder is it worth it?
People can change, I'm living physical proof
I'm not important, or special or different from you
To other people, I may seem like a good adviser
But to myself I feel like a dirty womanizer
I am just a man, I will never be a celebrity
That is a mantra I will cling to until the death of me
Don't wanna feed my kids the very treachery they fed to me
Preferably the aim is equality eventually
Don't relegate me below, or elevate me above to you
Needless to say, in either place I'm uncomfortable
I treat you as an equal, I'm simply a man
Your brother in humanity is everything that I am

[Hook]
Everything I am, and everything I want to be
I put it in your hands, you could open up to me





Everything I am, and everything I want to be
I put it in your hands, you could open up to me
Oh don't we ever get beyond this wall

[Verse 2]
Listen close to the words that were sang in the chorus
There's a big difference between fans and supporters
Never asked to be scrutinized or consumerized
Or treated differently to any other human life
Most don't, but some do and it saddens me
Force fed celebrity to subdue our humanity
See the false image depicted and think it's purity
When beneath that image they hold more insecurities
Than you do, but sometimes it's hard to tell who's who
There's more to life than Twitter followers and YouTube views
And if I came across like I was cocky I am sorry
You were born original so please don't die a copy
Don't relegate me below, or elevate me above to you
Needless to say, in either place I'm uncomfortable
I treat you as an equal, I'm simply a man
Your brother in humanity is everything that I am

[Hook]
Everything I am, and everything I want to be
I put it in your hands, you could open up to me
Everything I am, and everything I want to be
I put it in your hands, you could open up to me
Oh don't we ever get beyond this wall
