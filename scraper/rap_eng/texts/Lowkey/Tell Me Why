Put your lighters up
Put your lighters up
Put your lighters up

They will fight 'till extinction
Using nations as weapons

[Verse 1: Lowkey]

I've been gone for a while but don't watch that
'Cus now I'm back ready to show all these whack rappers how to rap
Type my name on youtube and watch that, get the picture. Yep
I'm the biggest threat to your little rep on the internet

Forget Channel U don't watch that, no one spits facts
And since Wifey Riddim everybody's making chit chats
But when my vid drops and you watch that, you'll be seeing why
There's a big difference between me and the meaty guys

MTV cribs I don't watch that, the greed sickens me
I guess I just look at the world and see it differently
Kids starving to death when I watch that, I cry inside
How can these rappers live in yards that type of size?

Kids film happy slaps and they watch that, then text their friends
Generations of degenerates, will it never end?
The Twin Towers fell and we watched that
It was controlled demolition, there was no terrorism; it's not that

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Lowkey]

Youths get the Scarface movie and watch that, live that violent dream
They shoulda watched more carefully in the final scene
Forget Big Brother don't watch that, even if the other TV's shit
You can't spend your life watching people live

Turn off Fox News, don't watch that - read a book
Glance back at history 'cus we need to look
They film us on CCTV and watch that, are we catalogue humans?
Oyster cards stay tracking our movements

Forget Myspace don't watch that, I ain't feeding Murdock
Or looking at girls posing with their skirts off
Forget profile hits, don't watch that, I know people can tell
Those numbers don't equal yourselves

Forget Borat, don't watch that, it ain't funny fam
And that's start of something bigger than you understand
And there's talk on the road but don't watch that, 'cus I'm well known
And wherever I go my name rings like a cellphone

[Hook]
