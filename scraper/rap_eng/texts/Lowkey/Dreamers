[Intro:]
This one is dedicated to the dreamers
Most people see things that are there and ask why
Dreamers, see things that aren't there and ask why not
I'm dreamin' with you

[Verse 1:]
I once knew a girl who on the surface was as solid as a rock
Future full of promise and mind seemed stronger than an ox
Face of beauty and a tongue was as honest as it got
That wasn't what is was, problem rock bottom she was lost
I couldn't see this sweet genius was full of secrets
Full of demons that pulled her deeper in this pool of leeches
Confused by the news, I was bruised when they told me
It concludes to the truth, was she consumed by the loneliness?
She was a true queen, nothing like Elizabeth
Often caught her starin' into space with a distant look
Considerate but detached from others even when intimate
Now I'm searchin' for answers I'd never find in a book
Last time I saw her, before the day she took her life
I wish I fixed her pain, I shoulda, coulda, woulda tried
But I took it personally and turned to leave
And to this day I'm still haunted by the words she screamed...

[Hook:]
Sometimes I really really hate myself
Sometimes I wish that I could change myself
Sometimes I don't wanna give no more
And sometimes I just don't wanna live no more
Sometimes I don't know where to call for help
Sometimes I don't really know myself
Sometimes I wish that I could fly away
And find away to a brighter day

[Verse 2:]
They say that life is a question and death is the answer
But Niko lost his brother and Rewds lost his father
God bless your souls please know that I love you both
They say time heals but the pain still doesn't go
I've seen my brother die and seen my mother cry
Seen the wind change in the flutter of a butterfly
Seen people get sectioned for life, I think and wonder
A small twist of fate, that could've been my brother
25 years a life could say thus far
I always have wondered who the sane ones are
Though I live by the words "fear not", I'm afraid
When I wrote this so many tears dropped on the page
It's mad how death always manifests in the weirdest ways
Won't go near the grave but in my dreams he appears the same
Then I get closer and see his face, it's clear as day
He looks me deep in the eyes and I hear him say...

[Hook:]
Sometimes I really really hate myself
Sometimes I wish that I could change myself
Sometimes I don't wanna give no more
And sometimes I just don't wanna live no more
Sometimes I don't know where to go for help
Sometimes I don't really know myself
Sometimes I wish that I could fly away
And find away to a brighter day
