[Hook]
I know you got a man, I know he treat you right
I know you need excitement, wanna live your life
I know the things you want, you don’t gotta lie
And you don’t gotta leave girl, you can spend the night
Yeah, good morning mean good bye, good bye, good bye
Good morning mean good bye, yeah
I said good morning mean good bye, good bye, good bye
Good morning mean good bye, yeah

[Verse One: Emilio Rojas]
Damn, come and stand with a real man
The one you with a fucking bitch and I can feel that
You want a man who gon’ respect you and protect you
And don’t see your independence as neglectful
I let you do your thing girl, I know my place
I love the way my shirt is hanging off your shoulder blade
Panty line below your waist, I know he hurt you
But baby, I’ll be your Novocain
Way your thighs shaking around my head girl, I know you came
I know you stressing and wondering why I jetted
‘Cause you trying to be my girl and yet I can’t commit to friendship
You say I hurt the ones I love and don’t respect ‘em
If I hurt the ones I love, it’s just to test ‘em but everything a test
Now everybody passes, all my exes bad so a bad bitch is average
Playing hard to get, it’s better with a challenge
I promise if I want it, I could have it

[Hook]

[Verse Two: Emilio Rojas]
Yeah, you hit him up when I’m with ya
Like “babe, I miss ya” and talk to him while I strip ya
And send him texts while I kiss ya, huh?
You playing both sides, it’s cool with me
‘Cause you ain’t my girl, I know your ass ain’t made a fool of me
You could see that you and me done had our share of women
You and me be sharing women, you be kissing on her
Girl, you tearing in it, you ain’t comparing him to me
We after different things, I just wanna give you orgasms
He tryna give you rings, my favorite thought of you
Is sitting in that loft with you, you show up in my crib
In Louboutins and shit he bought for you
I’m in the car when he call you and you just texting back
Begging me to fuck you raw just to disrespect his ass
Ain’t no commitment, you my temporary chick, right?
‘Cause I got problems, you my temporary fix, right?
No expectations baby, you know what it is
The night belongs to us but mama, you belong to him

[Outro]
I know you got a man, I know he treat you right
I know you need excitement, wanna live your life
I know the things you want, you don’t gotta lie
And you don’t gotta leave girl, you can spend the night
Yeah, good morning mean good bye, good bye, good bye
Good morning mean good bye, yeah
I said good morning mean good bye, good bye, good bye
Good morning mean good bye, yeah
I know you got a man, I know he treat you right
I know you need excitement, wanna live your life
I know the things you want, you don’t gotta lie
And you don’t gotta leave girl, you can spend the night
Yeah, good morning mean good bye, good bye, good bye
Good morning mean good bye, yeah
I said good morning mean good bye, good bye, good bye
Good morning mean good bye, yeah
(Get your ass up, get your ass up, get ya, get ya, get your ass up)
