I believe...

[Verse 1- lowkey]
I believe in equality, freedom & honesty
I believe that I'm a born leader so follow me
I believe in respecting others
I believe that sons should learn from their fathers and protect their mothers
I believe that you reap what you sow
And people won't believe if you don't speak what you know
I believe the jewels are sacred and I'm gonna be the greatest
But I'll leave this place before I'm fully appreciated
I believe in choosing your path but to improve in advance
You have to understand your roots and your past
The future is ours, there's room for our Tunes in the charts
And we'll become superstars if my crew gets the chance
I believe life's a lesson, we're all students in class
I believe that MC's are confusing this art
There's lies on the telly but there's truth in my heart
Do you believe in yourself or is that stupid to ask
Cause I believe...

[Hook-Eden rox]
I believe my future's gonna bring me greater things
I believe in getting anything it ain't impossible & easy to achieve
Ain't nothing wrong you can change your dreams
Make your moves and take the lead
I believe... we can do anything

[Verse 2- Lowkey]
I believe I was placed on this earth for a specific reason
Numerous close shaves, but still I'm flipping breathing
And I believe all oppressed people should be given freedom
I believe you saw them kids starving, you just didn't feed 'em
I believe in love, I believe in peace, I believe in God
Somehow, some way; we're gonna beat the odds
I don't believe in black or white (no), only wrong or right
I believe there's other life forms up beyond the skies
I believe you can't judge a book by it's cover
We're still brothers even if we don't look like each other
I believe it's up to you to find the life you'd like to live
I believe God guides my hand when I'm writing this
I got other purposes besides just rap
I believe I'll probably die before I relax
But if Muhammad Ali won his title back
Then I can change the world when I write a track
Cause I believe

[Hook- Eden rox]

[Verse 3- Lowkey]
I believe in miracles
I believe the spirit goes to a peaceful place when you leave the physical
I'm privileged to have a opinion that people listen to
Hope this song can ease your mind if you're feeling miserable
I don't believe in fiction, facts make better movies
I cry freedom for Steve, Beco and fela kuti
They can never move mee even if they execute me
Listen to my words and every sentence cause I meant them truly
I believe that Marley, Marvin, Martin and Malcolm did
Become an alchemist with this evil I've been surrounded with
However is Mount Everest standing on the mountain stick
I'm not about to live on my knees with cuts around my wrists
I believe it's essential I represent my peers
Please let go of your fears and your sentimental tears
If Mandela got free after 27 years
Then I can change the world with this record that you hear
Cause I believe...
