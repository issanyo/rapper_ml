[The Narcicyst: Intro]

Growing Up.... watching Jiddu
I felt like, he was the King of Poetry
I Must be the Prince of Poets
Let's Go!

[Hook:]

Hubris, using my illusions
All about the music
Where no one's on my side..
And I knew it, somehow we Confused it
Lost In All the Music
Probably Prophesying My...

[The Narcicyst: Verse 1]

Yeah, Yeah They Say we immigrated
We had to make a move
I've been intimidated, hated and given papers
My father knew better
Put down so belittled
Put up with so much
But always proved whether Ollah hadeen
I Almost didn't make it through the winter
My parents looking bitter
System got my sister thinner
That's when I﻿ twisted in the thoughts of a new beginner
Iraqis sitting close to mics like Scottie Pippen
We splitting Stereo in your aereo
It's radio...burial
I'm a serial, here we go again, scenario
Than here we go with some maters
Higher than rocketeers
When we pop the snares
And when they say Yahcoo

Old man your whole gang is totalitarian
You both whack I spoke that, toe tag the pair of them
My flow’s mad, my notepad is so fat it’s scaring ‘em
Sleep with the fish, like their homes have aquariums
A paragon of acting wrong
Half vagabond, Half dapper don
Batter up any track that I spat upon
You can carry on with the battle songs that you babble on
I want listeners from Babylon to the Amazon
Spat some dark, savage bars, that could channel graphic art
Picking up images that Avatar’s cameras can't
It’s hard to diss a partnership of arsonists as hard as bricks
Half hearted artists can’t exist
Tell Em’ Narcicyst
