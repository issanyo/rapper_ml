Yeah, this is Lowkey
And this is straight from the heart blood
Yeah, for all my people
Wherever you may be in your life blood
Yeah, all my women and men
Understand this is for you
No frontin' is involved right now, ya know
It's all real

We've been friends since four years old
Always speak your mind, never keep your ears closed
Sure, we'll grow in different directions
But I'll stick with my bredrans
Till I live off of pension
But I've got to give hip-hop a mention
Together as youngsters we faced the beasts
Grew from concrete that paves the streets
Escaped from racist beef, we blazed the weed
I feel like I was raised in greed
Bruv I believe in you cause you've got faith in me
I know circumstance is a fuckery
But I'll never forget what certain mans have done for me
Bruv we link up stronger than blood, closer than family
So if you want it with us you're provoking a tragedy
Bruv over the years you've been my best friend
From the ends around foolish peers from the west end
Rippin' mics together, but remember
'cause none of us are living life forever
And any of us might die tomorrow
For people to look on our lifetime with sorrow
We set trends guys try to follow
They might like the model
But write rhymes that are hollow
We living up in the ends
But picture us in a benz
A long way from billin' up at the bench
I'm spittin' this outta love for my thugs and my friends

For all those I still speak to
Guess we're still people
Life's more peaceful when you grow
And you eating legal
For all those I still speak to
Guess we're still people
Life's more peaceful when you grow
And you eating legal

This goes out to every man dissing the girls
Women to me, are the key to bliss in the world
As long as there's breath in my lungs
I try hard to show respect to my mum
And treat my woman like a queen. Why?
'cause she's always got good advice for me
But arguments are the type you wouldn't like to see
This is for mans showin' disrespect to frisky skets
Indulgin' in risky sex
Suck my dick and wanna kiss me next?
You must be crazy. I've been through a lot of shit
But won't let the fuckeries change me
I'm a nice guy, but in bed I bully chicks
I swear Dan I won't ever get pussy whipped
Even when she's got her hands on my hoody zip
And whisperin' in my ear
"Shall we strip?"
I know a girl that was raised in insanity
Life tainted with tragedy
Age eight she was rapped in the family
Nineteens can't stop weight tracing calories
I pray to see you, one day living happily
You've got issues deeper than the oceans bottom
But the kindness in your heart won't go forgotten
Can't love anyone else if your soul is rotten
Hoes are common
I used to chirpse em just rob the phones and chop em'
It's hard for me to front
The first time we met, you became a part of me a once

For all those I still speak to
Guess we're still people
Life's more peaceful when you grow
And you eating legal
For all those I still speak to
Guess we're still people
Life's more peaceful when you grow
And you eating legal
