[Intro - Lowkey]
This is unity, this is the real versus the fake
This is the substance versus the image
This is the equality of all versus the supremacy of some
Lowkey, Akala, Black The Ripper, lets make history!

[Lowkey]
I believe in equality, freedom and honesty
I believe that I’m a born leader so follow me
This tune can touch you deep, what can it do for love and peace?
Forget the color of your skin, we’re all just humans underneath
But, we were conditioned to be ashamed of intelligence
Take pride in your brain, it’s your chain that’s irrelevant
These monsters on the mic chatting nonsense in their rhymes
Forget your wallet and your ride, what’s the contents of your mind?
You better listen when I tell the television tricks you well
Don’t let them dictate to you the definition of yourself
Cause when it’s said and done the products are all irrelevant
And a man who stands for nothing will fall for anything
The threats to keep you dumb, but don’t mentally succumb
Take steps to reach your son, ’till your legacy is done
We are set to see a better dream, eventually will come
The equality of all and the supremacy of none!
I believe, I believe

[Hook Edan Rox]
I believe my future's gonna' bring me greater things, yes, I believe!
I believe we can be anything, it ain't impossible it's easy to achieve
Ain't nothing wrong, you can chase your dreams. Make your moves and take the lead
I believe we can do anything, yes, I believe!

[Akala]
Yo, yo, yo, yo
I believe in truth, no matter who is speaking it
And of course I believe in justice, no matter who’s receiving it
Believing almost nothing, I am told is the status quo
Cause history shows how the lies un-fold
I believe we can use the term conspiracy theory
To discredit inconvenient ideas without the slightest query
Not that they’re necessarily correct but the world
We have created is one that’s blatantly tamed to regurgitate hatred
The ones at the top think we’re pawns here for their controlling
It’s about maintaining the privilege that they’ve already stolen
But, we, the people can feel our consciousness is changing
So, no matter how they brutalize they cannot restrain it
I believe every child’s a born genius, they’re just taught
How not to be and place barriers between us
I don’t believe in human nature, just conditioned behavior
I don’t believe your oppressor, could ever would ever be your savior

[Hook]

[Black the Ripper]
Samson, Samson, yeah
I believe in making money and investing
I believe in God but religion, that’s a next thing
Terrorism and recession was made to force us into submission
Now look everybody is stressin’
It’s a deadly weapon, gotta’ stay two steps ahead of ‘em
I’m like Nat Turner, with a big strap I’m deading them
Born and raised in Edmonton, but the struggle’s universal
So in the hood trust is minimal cause anyone can hurt you
I believe in my talent so I use it
Prayin’ one day real music can move units
We do this but we ain't appealing to little school kids
That’s why labels think we’re intimidating, bullshit!
I prefer the word educated
Yes I’m rated but sometimes I feel underestimated
I’m only 23 rebelling in this crazy city. I can’t do this by myself
I need you all to change it with me
I believe

[Hook]

[Outro - Lowkey]
So there you have it
If you’re sick of these DJ’s playing the same 20 songs over and over again, text them, email them. Tell them to start playing the realness
Peace and love
