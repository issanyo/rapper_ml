[Hook: Mai Khalil]
Whoa, give me the words, give me the words
That tell me nothing
Dear England
Whoa, give me the words, give me the words
That tell me nothing

[Verse 1]
They say God save the queen, Britannia rules the waves
Britannia's in my genes, but Britannia called us slaves
Britannia made the borders, cause Britannia's forces came
Britannia lit the match, but Britannia fears the flame
Where blood stains the pavement, tears stain a cheek
And privilege is threatened, the fear reigns supreme
Where bankers are earning, from burning and looting
The nervous are shooting, search for solutions
I shed a tear for the father in Birmingham
Quick swerve of the car and it murdered them
In Tottenham the apartments were burning
And nobody came just arson is circling
All wanna be down till TVs get robbed like jewels on the queens crown
They say now no cause for a rebound
See now they call me a fool cause I speak out
People are humans, not mindless animals
This violent tyrannical system is fallable
Hand in a looter the minute you see 'em
But the biggest looters are the British museum
This happened here and you think its a accident
Just relax as we slip into fascism
And the fear gets drilled into your hearts
But remember these children are all ours

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
If a policeman can kill a black man where he found him
A soldier can kill an Afghan in the mountains
A petty thief can get ransacked from his housing
While the bankers are lounging
That's my surroundings
Took land, no one in your family has heard of
Before you sleep, whisper the mantra you learnt cause
Never will there be a day that cameras are turned off
Who runs this country, Cameron or Murdoch?
Who's the government, a government that can't govern
Can't you figure it's ways bigger than Mark Duggan
Bigger than Smiley, bigger than Jean Charles
Hundreds are dead not one killer is on trial
Just a familiar sound of hysteria
Bombs over Libya but not this area
Downing Street I can find villains
Cut education, privatise prisons
Surprised by theft when it's organised
But mass immorality is normalised
Assumptions surrounding the looting of London
But this is a system consumed by consumption
Yea it happened here and you think its a accident
Just relax as we slip into fascism
And the fear gets drilled into your hearts
But remember these children are all ours

[Hook]
