[Rev. Jeremiah Wright]
What Malcolm X said when he got silenced by Elijah Mohammed was in fact true
America's chickens, are coming home to roost
We took this country by terror, away from the Sioux, the Apache, the Arowak, the Comanche, the Arapahoe, the Navajo. Terrorism
We took Africans from their country to build our way of ease and kept them enslaved and living in fear
Terrorism
We bombed Granada and killed innocent civilians, babies, non-military personnel
We bombed the black civilian community of Panama with stealth bombers and killed unarmed teenagers and toddlers, pregnant mothers, and hardworking fathers
We bombed Qaddafi's home and killed his child
Blessed are they who bash your children's head against a rock
We bombed Iraq
We killed unarmed civilians trying to make a living
We bombed a plant in Sudan to payback for the attack on our embassy
Killed hundreds of hardworking people
Mothers and fathers who left home to go that day not knowing that they would never get back home
We bombed Hiroshima
We bombed Nagasaki and we nuked far more than the thousands in New York and the Pentagon and we never batted an eye
Kids playing in the playground, mothers picking up children after school, civilians, not soldiers, people just trying to make it day by day
We have supported state terrorism against the Palestinians and Black South Africans and now we are indignant because the stuff we have done overseas is now brought right back to our own front yards

America's chickens are coming home to roost
Violence begets violence
Hatred begets hatred
And terrorism begets terrorism
