[Verse 1]
To say I might be going somewhere is an understatement
I’m elated, must be related to someone famous
Way I’m set up for greatness
Good gracious
Good God
I'mma stunt
Like Jon Kralt in Hot Rod
Rush my voice to the crowds
Pull a Limbaugh
Yeah I’m limber
Flex with me
Got the lumber
Smoke the best tree
Cumming on that lumbar
Mess-free
Mystery flow, so Nessie
Find me in the Loch Ness

[Hook 1]
Talking ain’t doing you no good
You need to talk less
Talking about that money
Ain’t got none up in them pockets
Keep on talking
Shit you’re saying pretty far from shocking
Man, I’m feeling flawless

[Verse 2]
Keep my courage
No cowards amongst my dogs
They come with that bravado
If this is Chowder, I’m Gaspacho
Like a wooly mammoth
My flow so ancient
Rocket Power? I’m Otto
So bro, you ain’t shit
Want a flip trick?
I throw my middle finger
I believe I can fly
Like R Kelly
Fly as a pigeon
I avoid all the wringers
Rap game: Jerry Spinelli
Talking games
Talking Recess
A different Spinelli
Call me TJ Detweiler
Been scheming all the while
Maintaining the style
That my name proclaims
Aim for fame
Yet I stay the same
Only change for the better
Seek pleasure through the pressure

[Hook 2]
Talking ain’t doing you no good
You need to talk less
Talking bout that money
Ain’t got none up in them pockets
Keep on talking
Shit you’re saying soundin’ like some nonsense
Man, I’m feeling flawless

[Verse 3]
As a diamond
My mind intact
Been finding out that
My knack for rap
Is in fact
Staying on track
I make tracks
Back to back
Most fools quacks
Like Aflac
I’m rad
Took first place at Helltrack
Guess you lack
The mad skills I stack
Like bills in a bank
Man I cracked the vault
No insult could harm me
Armored like an army tank
Camo paint
I’mma hide in plain sight
Wait till the time is right
Gain insight
Entertain the fight in me
Semi-automatic
With these words
Had to swerve on ya
Smoke aromatic
Got that herb
So observe
I’mma show you how it’s done

[Hook 3]
Talking ain’t doing you no good
You need to talk less
Talking bout that money
Ain’t got none up in them pockets
Keep on talking
Shit you’re saying ain’t making it through to my conscious
Man, I’m feeling flawless
