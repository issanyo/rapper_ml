Money can buy power but can’t buy respect
Money can't buy you love but it can buy sex
Money can't buy you sleep but it can buy a bed

Money can buy you a house but it can't buy a home

I know people with plenty of ps that are miserable
We all need to earn in this world we live in
We all work for it, some still but many worship it
Some sell poison for it some seek employment for It
We need it to survive, so some clean the toilets for it
I need papes to live for it but never will I live for papes
So fuck the queen I don’t wanna see that bitches face
Many sell their souls for It, no not me
Some will try to tell you it doesn't grow on trees
But moneys paper, paper we get it from the trees
Not the route of evil just the root of inequality
Most think they'd be happy if they only had more of it
Some wasted some feel guilty cause they're born with it
Some have got the nerve to say your fortunate for fortuning? it
The truth is you don’t need a fortune to be fortunate
