The views expressed on this track are not directly those of Lowkey or Logic, were just drawing attention to the lifestyles that some people lead

[Lowkey:] I was born in Bermondsey, one of the south parts

[Logic:] And I was born in Bazara, southside of Iraq

[Lowkey:] We used to play football outside in the park

[Logic:] We used to dodge bullets outside in the dark

[Lowkey:] I never prayed, I was told there isn't a god

[Logic:] I prayed 5 times a day it's like I lived in a mosque

[Lowkey:] Me, I'm easy with a pint and some cricket to watch

[Logic:] They sanctioned everything we got, so now it isn't a lot

[Lowkey:] My mom and dad worked hard, always had employment

[Logic:]
My mom just left and my dad got poisoned
I was young but I was told that the government did it

[Lowkey:]
From my heart I can say that I love being British
I grew with 5 older brothers and sisters

[Logic:]
Yeah I had a lot of siblings but some have gone missing
Now it's just me and my little sis

[Lowkey:] Britain's got a lot of immigrants; they take our jobs everyday I swear I'm sick of it

[Logic:] My Uncles trying to get to Britain quick

[Lowkey:] I'm trying to find a job

[Logic:] Me I'm still illiterate

[Lowkey:] every 2 weeks I'm signing on

[Logic:] we only had school a little bit

[Lowkey:] I got kicked out of school very early, labeled as an idiot

[Logic:] Before my uncle left us, he gave me his gun

[Lowkey:] my girl just gave me a son

[Logic:] You see it's hot where I live, every day I bake in the sun

[Lowkey:]
It's cold where I live so I read every page of the sun
And I'm getting mad, with what I look at and read

[Logic:] I just met a couple elders that are good on their deen

[Lowkey:] My dad told me joining an army would be good for the peace

[Logic:]
I started meeting, now I'm training with the mujahedeen
Because I've heard that the westerners are coming with bombs

[Lowkey:] I spent months in the regiment training up to be shot

[Logic:] But this is my land, my country, I'll defend it till I pass

[Lowkey:] I just got the message that they're sending me to Iraq

Pain is the same fam, it's all relative
They cried the same tears, you cried for your relatives
And one way or another, my brother were all relatives
Home is where the heart is, yeah that's where it is [x2]

[Lowkey:]
Now I'm in the south of Iraq, it's a smelly place
I don't know who to trust, everybody's got a hairy face

[Logic:]
And Bazara's a scary place, it's worse than it used to be
They're dropping bombs everyday

[Lowkey:] Even little boys shoot at me

[Logic:] I shoot at white faces, and any green suit I see

[Lowkey:] Every regiment's lost a couple of troops; we've lost 2 or 3

[Logic:] I still go to pray in the same place the mosque used to be

[Lowkey:] I see little kids starving to death, with no food to eat
But an orders an order, we've got to clean the city up

[Logic:]
They see how we're suffering, and still they don't pity us
They shoot us every day tomorrow's probably me

[Lowkey:] We're trying to help these bastards, but it's like they don't want to be free

[Logic:] Yeah these people don't know what freedom is

[Lowkey:] I saw my colleague rape a woman against her will, but I didn't agree with it

[Logic:] I shot a soldier in the face, and then I hacked '. Real quick

[Lowkey:]
My sergeant got shot in his face by some dumb young kid
Now I just want to go home that's where my heart is

[Logic:] My heart is in Bazara, and never will I part it

[Lowkey:] this wars going nowhere, tell me why did we start it'

[Logic:] I'm fighting regardless till I'm resting where Allah is

[Lowkey:]
Come to think of it, I should have never joined the army
And when I think about it, I don't hate these Iraqi's

[Logic:]
Yeah bullets flying past me, I'm scared but I can't run
I take my sister upstairs and get my uncles old gun

[Lowkey:]
Don't know if it's terrorists or just some civilians
But I've been told to neutralize the threat up in that building

[Logic:] I see the soldiers they're about to pass, I take my pistol out and blast

[Lowkey:]
A bullet whizzes by my face and tears my friends mouth apart
I saw red, and starting shooting to make em all dead

[Logic:] I tried to guard my sister, but a bullet hit her forehead

[Lowkey:]
I ran up the steps to see if I buried them all
But all I saw was my little sister dead on the floor

Pain is the same fam, it's all relative
They cried the same tears, you cried for your relatives
And one way or another, my brother were all relatives
Home is where the heart is, yeah that's where it is
