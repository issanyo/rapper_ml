(Verse 1)
I know you wanna skype but I can only facetime
Eleven o'clock hits and my voice goes way down
Good music plays at your place your waist goes way down
Not for dirty Matt, but for the whole grace size
Got the whole city thinking that we be thingin
This a magic act, we make everyone here start thinkin
Took me a long time to write this but I still hit it
Won't hit you, im gentle, fuck the influence in here, eh

(Chorus)
Have a car, but drive too fast
Had an R-E-A, but can't too last
Had an I-and-B, but can't you pass
Had some green shit please dont get grassed
Had some real probs, that was in the past
Sent some L-O-V's, I sent some back
Glasses on her face, got some on mine
Hopin that one day shell be mine

(Verse 2)
And I know I do cuz I shouldn't really use you
And itd hurt so much if I were even to lose you
Probs more than the past, probs more that times two
Hopin you hear this, also hopin you respond too
Cuz you live far away, but not too far away
Have glasses sometimes on her face, never stay away
Had some problems in the past but its A-Okay
So did I, thats why were humans and we live another day, eh


(Chorus)
Have a car, but drive too fast
Had an R-E-A, but can't too last
Had an I-and-B, but can't you pass
Had some green shit please dont get grassed
Had some real probs, that was in the past
Sent some L-O-V's, I sent some back
Glasses on her face, got some on mine
Hopin that one day shell be mine

Have a car, but drive too fast
Had an R-E-A, but can't too last
Had an I-and-B, but can't you pass
Had some green shit please dont get grassed
Had some real probs, that was in the past
Sent some L-O-V's, I sent some back
Glasses on her face, got some on mine
Hopin that one day shell be mine

(Outro)
Not that thick, still thicker than a snicker
I still appreciate you, stickin like a sticker
Through my tough times, you was actin bigger
Than your role, to save me from a quitter
[eh, eh, eh]
