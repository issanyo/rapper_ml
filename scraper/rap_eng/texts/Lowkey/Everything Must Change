Everything must change...

I'm not some kinda superman
I'm just tryna find who I am
And get my future plan
Don't know where I'm from
Don't know what my aim is
Don't know where I'm going
Don't wanna be famous
Don't wanna be that guy
I need privacy but can't be low-key cause it isn't me
Get pulled both ways and it tears me apart
Seems for years I've been wearing this mask
One to myself, another to the multitude
Now I'm confused with which one of those is true
In bed alone lyin myself
I realize I was lying to myself
Now I'm here, finding myself
The truth's out there I'm a find it myself
Forget going on a holiday bruv
I just wanna change

Everything...

I wish that I could make a happy song
But I'm depressed and I don't wanna carry on
I don't know what you've been told G
But no one alive truly knows me
Forget rapping I should find a job
I need direction, maybe a sign from God
I'm tortured, the pain's tormenting my soul
Got friends but I just can't pretend, I'm alone
I'm haunted, by regrets and mistakes
And everyday I'm just testing my fate
Like a boxer that loves throwing rights at them
But doctors warned him, he'll die if he fights again
Sometimes it feels like the weight of the world is on my shoulders
But that's just the way of the world
It's getting colder, it's too cold
Don't know much but I do know

Everything must change...
Must change...
Must change...
Must change...

So I've made music that made my mum cry
Bruv told me what happens when a loved dies
Don't even recognize my own face sometimes
Don't wanna stay around now, but I must try
Someone, somewhere might understand
I just don't wanna give my life to the fans
I'm tryna do more than just be real
In order to rebuild

Everything must change...

I'm just tryna survive today
And live my life in a righteous way
So I gotta watch what I decide to say
My pride's at stake
Don't wanna be described as fake
My mind states, I rate
And I'm wide awake
But I need sleep and it's kind of late
Don't wanna give them a reason to despise and hate
So I'm tryna change

Everything...

All around me, my people's dying
All being controlled by evil tyrants
Lives lost due to needless violence
Look to the sky, cause I need some guidance
But it feels like nothing helps
Gotta watch for my sister and my mum as well
Everyday it feels like I'm stuck in hell
I guess this is sort of how my brother felt...

See... just gotta hold on
Hope for the best...
Prepare for the worst...
Cause nothing is promised...
All I know is...

Everything must change...
