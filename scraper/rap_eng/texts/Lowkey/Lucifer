[Intro: Lowkey]
This is Lowkizzy, repping London City!
This is Lowkizzy, repping London City!
Gotta make sure you understand!
Yeah!
Yeah, you ready?

[Verse 1: Lowkey]
I'm an outlaw reppin' the streets
Every place in the South, North, West and the East
Forget a punchline, I break your mouth and jaw
And the rest of your teeth
Any other MC about war, come second to me
I stand without flaws from my head to my feet
It sounds raw, when I wrestle the beat
What you acting proud for?
Me, you can never defeat
You can see me down the pound stores
Steppin' outdoors just to get in a Jeep
Go to murk your man spurt in a van after I left him asleep
Like I said get your jaw broke quick and your torso split
On the mic, my people don't talk no shit
Stay repping all night, while yours don't spit
I'm getting pissed of with these fool gays
Undermining Hip Hop from the UK
For that blood, I'll rap to the death
Blood I told you before man I'm better than blessed
Grew with the most ruthless of kids a lost baby
Finally using the gift that God gave me
I'm not crazy just deranged and insane
I came to explain the foul state of the game
Many out chasing for fame without making a name
My belly's aching with pain
Any faker that hates and trys to spit a verse at me
Gets left looking like a circus freak
On his knees screaming "mercy please"
And he ain't even heard me speak
I don't give a fuck whether your 15 or 33
Is all good, I make dorks walk awkard
Tryna to step to this step, get left with a twisted soar foot
Coming in the place leave a space where the door stood
Listen jokers you get dangled of the cliffs of Dover
Leave a undercover agents mission over
Im not a snake, but on the mic, I'm a viscious cobra
Quick to expose a rapper with a bitch persona
So what's gwarning?
