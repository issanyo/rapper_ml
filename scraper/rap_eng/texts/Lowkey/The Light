[Intro: Stylah]
Yeah, Stylah, Lowkey…
This one’s for the females that don’t get enough respect out there…

[Verse 1: Stylah]
Look, did I laugh? Did I call you a name boo?
I’m sorry I was supposed to call you an angel
And when I called you a bitch
I was meant to call you a queen - my tongue slipped
And if I treated you bad, beefed with your dad, cheated behind your back beating a slag
I’m sorry
We’ve been through episodes like Corrie
Down many roads like a long-haul lorry
And nah this ain't a riddim for a girl
It’s more like a song for all the women of the world
When we treated you like just another item on the shelf
Treated you like pussy when you’re more like a pearl
And I know you’re putting up your guard girl
I guess it’s cos we’re living in this harsh world
I know you’re protecting your feelings in a hard shell
And certain breddas get defensive cos they can’t tell
They call you names like sket and whore
But really deep down they respect you more
Shit, we show our feelings in a funny way
We might say some dumb shit on a hungry day, Ay
And I know you’re putting on a brave face
I know it’s still a man’s world things ain’t changed
You can work twice as hard in the work place
Still them jerks won’t reward you with the same pay
Labour, I can’t imagine the pain
So rate her, the women that keep us sane
My mum carried four boys for nine months each and worked her whole life to keep us out of the rain
And there’s no words to explain how much I love her
I know the path to heaven is at the feet of your mother
I know they get on our nerves and drive us crazy
But try and know they’re delicate and treat them like a lady!

Chorus

[Verse 2: Lowkey]
Your aura is magnetic
I’m caught in your damn presence
Delicate ettiquete and your more than just angelic
Hypnotized looking in your eyes the way that you move
Don’t know if I could live my life a day in your shoes
Cos your strength is incredible
Freedom is your name and trust me it’s destined ahead of you
If I could change the world in a blink of the eye, I would smash down the walls that imprison your life
When I see you, I see my future proud and secure
Always in my thoughts whenver i’m out on them tours
I worry for your safety
But how can i talk
You’ll live as an outlaw if you empower the poor
I am sorry for my faults and my failings, the awkward occassions i’ve messed up and wore out your patience
You’ll always remain in my thoughts when I’m acking to see you I need you, you’re more than amazing
