This war does not in any way serve the people of this country's interests
We have absolutely nothing to gain from invading and occupying another country which the British have failed at occupying many times before
Saddam Hussein, though a despicable murderous tyrant, posed absolutely no threat to the people of this country
The Taliban, though a group of abhorrent oppressive maniacs, never posed any threat to the people of this country
People die in wars
People are orphaned in wars
People are imprisoned in wars
People get raped in wars
People kill in wars
And people are haunted by their experiences of war
But some people do strive in wars
Some people do profit in wars
Arms companies like BAE Systems and Lockheed make billions from wars
The oil companies have made billions from these wars, but the people of this country do not gain anything from these wars
Not the British people
Not the American people
And not the Afghan people
There is nothing charitable about bombing somebody's country and occupying it
People have argued that this war was waged in order to defend the people of this country from possible terrorist attacks
On the contrary, this war has endangered British citizens all over the world
Not only has it cost British taxpayers millions of pounds, it has taken the lives of over 200 British soldiers and stolen the humanity of countless others
Rather than deter terrorist attacks, this occupation, like the Iraq one, has only endangered this country
There was a terrorist attack on British soil in 2005, but that was only after the British occupations of these countries had been underway for years already
The only lesson that can be learned from such events is that Britain's tireless support of the American empire and it's imperialist wars have hugely endangered the people of this country
While America's bombing has spread to the Swat Valley in Pakistan with Obama's remote control drones dropping bombs which have displaced at least two million and killed many, Gordon Brown has pledged to send more British troops to Afghanistan to kill and die
That is all that is required of the people that are sent there
Kill and die, while sacrificing your own humanity
But don't ever ask "Why?"
These soldiers are being told that this war is for the good of their country, and more worryingly, for the good of humanity
Where those humans that sent you to war will not lose one minute of sleep over your death, they want you to be robots, and that is all
If you are lucky, you will kill, and be killed
If you are unlucky, you will kill, and survive, only to live the rest of your life tortured by your past, but for what?
It is not for the good of your country, the United Kingdom, or Great Britain
The Queen couldn't care less about your life
Her grandson Harry did join the Army, just long enough to refer to one of his fellow troops as a packy, and the people those soldiers are supposedly liberating, as ragheads
The prince Harry episode is actually indicative of the indoctrination that is vital in this process of justification
They do not want their robots to ask questions
"Shut up, take a gun, and kill some ragheads"
That's all this country requires of it's robots
But, the truth is, throughout this process, the only person dehumanized is the British soldier himself
So when they tell you to "support the troops," the only real way of supporting the troops is by bringing them home now and today
This war does not serve the British people
It only harms us
It does not serve the soldiers themselves
It only harms them
The question is, "How can it possibly serve the interests of this country?"
An interesting way of working out whose interests British Prime Ministers were serving when in power, is to look at who they take jobs for, after there term is finished
For John Major, it was The Carlyle Group, a company with very close ties to the Bush family
For Tony Blair, it was JP Morgan, a company who made millions from the war in Iraq
Who will it be for Gordon Brown?
Who is Gordon Brown working for?
That is my question, because it certainly isn't the British people
