She said "The trust, you fucked it up, you liking all her pics, everyone's a homegirl, I ain't liking all this shit
While I'm lighting up the Piff
Phone on speaker
Trynna formulate the words so this won't go deeper
Bae, imma make it right
You calling me these names & you telling me you hate me
But I know its out of spite
Let's talk, come stay the night
Better yet, i'm pullin' up
You startin' not to talk
So I know you had enough
& IIIII done had enough of these other women
Don't know whyyyy I even really was fuckin' wit em
Why I gotta make you mad so I can get in my bag ?
& why we gotta break up so I see what I had ?
Ego-pride, edo-pride..
Im caugth between the two
"I", but it's never "I", it's realy me & you
Selfish, I been that
I cannot defend that
It's me & you
I cannot pretend that..
It's me alone..

Growing pains got you growing astray
I can't just keep fuckin' up & hoping you stay
I can't just keep runnin' games & hoping you play
Then wonder why you cold in the middle of May
That was my fault, I know
I induced those attidtudes that I hate
Fridge full, still I see new food & grab a plate
What a shame ?
My eyes bigger than my stomach
I got a main dish, I need to love it..
