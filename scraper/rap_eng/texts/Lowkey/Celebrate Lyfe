[Intro]
Alright, ok (alright, ok)
Alright, ok (alright, ok)
Yeah
Alright, ok (alright, ok)

We gon' head right to the preceding this eveing
By the way, the champagne is on me
(Drink up)

[Verse 1]
I went from bad news to effin' with bad broads
From seeing niggas clap to rappin' for your applause
I deserve an ovation, lavish vaction
Type of shit you dream when you sleeping in the basement
Me, I'm on that ape shit
I ain't talking bape shit
G-Rilla, it's like b-nana when I create shit
Face it, i'mma be around like a circle
Walking on cloud nine
It's like I'm puffing on purple
I was put on this earth to
Be all like a [?]
So i sip on me, in my Navy blue three's
In Mercedes, I breeze
Trough the city, no keys
Every whip push-start, nigga, this is so G
Growing up, I had hoes in my school shoes
But now i keep the numbers moving like pool cubes
A rude dude, no, Baby I'm a gentleman
And I can show you how to floss, no dental plan


[Chorus]
So we celebrate life
And i be on success
Ass like a brake light
Clear the Runway, we about to take flight
It's no dark moments when your future this bright

So we celebrate life
Said i be on success
Ass like a brake light (like a brake light)
Clear the runway, we about to take flight
It's G5 status when i write (Wridah)


[Verse 2]
Hopped of the bench and shoot straight to the All-Stars
Other niggas reached, couldn't reach me with a call card
This is life and I live it to the utmost
Room full of dudes, I am the one she want to fuck most
But I dont do the groupies, no Sir
And life's short, while you living, nigga, toast up
And this is for my brothers still struggeling
Locked down, so their baby-momma smuggeling
Never been the one that's worried 'bout their next man
I am a beast, no ex-man
Doing shit these fake rappers only dream about
A verse away from putting mama in her dream house
I can show you what this C.R.E.A.M. 'bout
Married to the game, tell Lo get the rings out
And I even sing vows to her
And I'm the shit in every field like [?]


[Chorus]
So we celebrate life
And i be on success
Ass like a brake light
Clear the Runway, we about to take flight
It's no dark moments when your future this bright

So we celebrate life
Said i be on success
Ass like a brake light (like a brake light)
Clear the runway, we about to take flight
It's G5 status when i write (Wridah)

So we celebrate life
And i be on success
Ass like a brake light
Clear the Runway, we about to take flight
It's no dark moments when your future this bright

So we celebrate life
Said i be on success
Ass like a brake light (like a brake light)
Clear the runway, we about to take flight
It's G5 status when i write (Wridah)


Alright, ok (alright, ok)
Alright, ok (alright, ok)
Alright, ok (alright, ok)
Alright, ok (alright, ok)
Alright, ok  (ok)
Alright, ok  (ok)
Alright, ok  (ok)
Alright, ok  (ok)
