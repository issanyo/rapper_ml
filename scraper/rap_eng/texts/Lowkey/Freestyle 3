It's like, it's like these days Dj's won't play a track if i'm on it. But ironically they play Dj Ironic, my logic tells me that i don't rap about the right topics. Because my politics scare people so they hide from it. Give me an instrumental and i'll shine on it, so bright i'll burn your eye socket
