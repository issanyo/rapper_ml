Oh my oh my God
Got damn you fine
I don't waste no time
I call yo hotline
I pull up outside
Going somewhere nice
Wine & dine you right
I wanna fuck tonight
If you give me that look , young nigga got luck tonight (aye)
And ya dress fit tight heels got your legs looking right (Aye)
Look like you fresh out ah magazine
Bitches should call your majesty
Let's take pic so yo man could see
Caption , your right where wanna be
We do not fuck with no wanna bee
Between your legs where wanna be
Girl I want you is that hard too see ( Stevie wonder)
Girl I want you is that hard too see (I really wonder )

If fine was crime , yo fine would be doing time but not worries I'll be there in time
Paying all paying all fucking fines
Long you mines
You'll be fine
Long you mines
Never rewind
Long as you mind
All the time
Dick yo in spin
Hope you don't mind!
Long you mind
You shine like a diamond
I'll buy ya diamonds
Pussy I dive in
Yo pussy a crime
I'm Guilty Guilty
Guilty your honor

{​​Chorus}​​
Oh my oh my God
Got damn you fine
I don't waste no time
I call yo hotline
I pull up outside
Going somewhere nice
Wine & dine you right
I wanna fuck tonight
If you give me that look , young nigga got luck tonight (aye)
And ya dress fit tight heels got your legs looking right (Aye)
Look like you fresh out ah magazine
Bitches should call your majesty
Let's take pic so yo man could see
Caption , your right where wanna be
We do not fuck with no wanna bee
Between your legs where wanna be
Girl I want you is that hard too see ( Stevie wonder)
Girl I want you is that hard too see (I really wonder )

{​​Second verse}​​
It been a mintue since I
Really kicked it with you
In a different realationship
Kinda glad that it
Isn't with you
I was tired of ya tripping
I bet you missing all the dicking
That you got with the cups of ciroc
Lord knows that it kept me hard rock
Lord knows I loved that shit
I know you did to I know you did to
I know you did to
