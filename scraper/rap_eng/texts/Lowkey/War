If you want war than whats happening?
You don't want more of this action
You do not want smoke with this captain
I just keep eating, I cannot stop, I cannot throw in my napkin
Whats cracking? The dragon, we racking, thats practice, no lacking
Hop on the beat and I bring the torture
A op with the heat when I bring it toward ya
This year is my season I'm bringing Goya
I hold that mic like I'm drinking water
Hi, can I help you ill take ya order
Stop. He scandalous, who Manz is this?
Shock. Handle this, get smoked. Camel stick
His plans, we canceled it
Move devious, I make bread, ingredients
Feed fam, no greediness
Haters mad at me, live lavishly
Walk up, I catch a battery, your soul rise, no gravity
