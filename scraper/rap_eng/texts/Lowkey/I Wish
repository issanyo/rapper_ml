[Verse 1]

Listen
Yeah
Look
I wish there wasn't no system
I wish death on almost every other politician
I wish freedom for all my brothers stuck in prison
I wish people weren't led by the television
I wish the kids turned against the media
Don’t believe everything you read on Wikipedia
Africa I wish that we were feeding ya and not raping ya wealth
I wish that people thought about somebody else before themself listen
Then maybe then we’d all live good B
If you need it then I got that the way it should be
Life’s nowhere near where it could be
Sometimes I wish that I was Lowkey and they come and took me
Cause I feel kinda bad in my heart cause I threw the first bang so it’s hard yeah we buss case
ITunes number 1 yeah forget papes
Forget any of the offers that the labels make

[Hook]

I wish
I wish that all my wrongs were right
And I wish
I wish that I could change my life
So my kids
Would never have to sacrifice
Like I did
So I give
And they live
People have to realize
That we live
We’re living in some crazy times
And I wish
I wish that we would all unite
And I wish
I wish I wish I wish

[Logic]
[Verse 2]

I wish for peace in every country
I wish for a stress-less life for my mummy
I wish that no kid went hungry
Cause trust me, if I had enough money
I’d fill up every hungry kid’s tummy
I wish that money gets abolished
So anyone can give everything to their kids never can’t afford it
I wish the whole world was able to live lawless
I wish that there wasn't no such thing as being the poorest
I wish we didn't know what more is
I wish that everyone saw everyone as beautiful and gorgeous
I wish for a lot of things
I wish that I was young and I still played for Kennington Kings look
I don’t wish for the fame or the glamour
I wish for everyone to understand us
See what I really wish for will probably never be
I wish Africa and Palestine were free

[Verse 3]

I wish I could see freedom for the Irish
And I wish you could see deeper than my iris
As I write this I wish
People would define it in a way that wasn't dictated by dividers and conquerors
Tell us conscious is what our genre is
You think their dominance is monstrous
But a bomb isn't stronger than a continent
Tell us we’re incompetent
That’s nonsense we’re just onto them
My confidence is shocking them
Not all open hands and open mouths
Dry your tears cause the pioneer's the global south
That is why we’re here
Never will I appear on Oprah’s couch
Only in the press when the feds put my photo out
They wonder why the mad and young are grabbing guns (Why?)
But you could speak with your hands if you didn’t have a tongue
Even that’s better than sitting down sad and numb
At times I wish I was Gaberlunzie and I was about to have a son
Scratch that had a baby girl
Live twice and bring life to this crazy world
Be on rap congrats for the new arrival
I’m stuck in Britain accustomed to living suicidal
But not for much longer
I realize that our culture is a weapon
And nowadays I’m much stronger
Simply to exist is what I wish
Retirement or not what I have written is timeless
