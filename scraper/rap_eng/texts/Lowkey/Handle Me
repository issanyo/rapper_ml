To my mum, my number one
I put you under none
This is a letter from your son
In case tomorow never comes
This is the most important tune that i've done
Cos you cared me in your womb for nine months
You gave me life, love, air to breathe
You gave me everything you've always been there for me
As a baby you handled me gentely and carefully
If I didn't have you, I don't you where I'd be
Your the best, the definiton of the superwomen
It's strange how things change when I move to full `em
There still love in this apartment that your living
In my mind I can see you dancing in the kitchen
And I can still hear the music you play
In a way your the reason I do this today
I can't lie, with your boyfriend is awkward
But if he brings you joy then it's all good
Im sorry things didn't work out with my daddy
But if this guy makes you happy, then I'm happy
Thanks for always supporting my rap thing
It's such a shame that all of this happened
And it's not you fault we lost your other boy
We've got everything, even if your unemployed
You didn't deserve the cards you were dealt
I promise I take care and look after myself
