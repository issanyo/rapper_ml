[Intro]
Sample

[Verse]
We've came so far, from where we used to be
Your my shooting star, know what you mean to me
And the feeling you give me, can't be replaced
Can't be explained, can't be contained (harmonizing)
Text you when i'm lonely
Hit your line when i feel like i don't know me
Cause you know me, better than I know myself
Can't give that to no one else
But your heart not in the same place
And it got me so out of place
What did I create? This is all a mistake
Wish it can be erased (x2)
I would go insane for your love girl
Fuck what friends say this our world
This is regret, I feel neglect, and i'm tired of lookin'
So I hope you don't forget me
When you find someone who gives what I couldn't

[Sample]

[Outro]
You got my soul, I love you
You got control, I trust you
And that's never gonna change
Till you truly don't feel the same
