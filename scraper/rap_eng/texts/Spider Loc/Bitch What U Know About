[Verse 1: 50 Cent]
Big money, big things
Big wrist watch, big diamond rings
My niggas love when the club be off the chain
Ya'll front they'll make you niggas take of them chains
You can run 'til the hollow tips hit ya frame
Hang on for ya life mayne
A little candy paint, a little bit of chrome
Some woodgrain a nigga money long
Call shots in this bitch like a boss should
What the fuck I want in your hood?
I cruise through ya strip ridin' real slow
I'm not shootin' but I can and I will though
Said I cruise through ya strip ridin' real slow
I'm not shootin' but I can and I will though

[Chorus: 50 Cent]

[Verse 2: Young Buck]
Keep my name out ya mouth
Before them AK shells come straight in ya house
Won't stop 'til ya whole block layin' hit 'em all up buck buck then we out
Fuck where you from nigga fuck what you 'bout
We can get it poppin'
Bodies start droppin'
Feds start watchin'
Niggas start talkin'
Death is knockin'
At your front door
Niggas really don't want war
Talkin' and walkin'
You'll meet your coffin
Ain't no stoppin'
When the Glock get to poppin'
Bitch niggas runnin', screamin' and hollerin'
Want to see what its like when you get shot?
Want to get jacked for ya iced out watch?
My tour bus filled up with guns I ain't tryin' to go out like Big and Pac

[Chorus: 50 Cent]

[Verse 3: Spider Loc]
Check ya ho
Check ya dough
Hate the game, but respect it though
Cock and blow
Let that go
Otherwise the Tec will blow
In other words ya neck will know
What it feels to have a exit hole
Them guns will make a nigga dumb turn him into a vegetable
I ruined mines
Doin' lines
My little niggas usin' nines
Spittin' rhymes
But I flip a bird
Feelin' like i'm losin' time
Got to get it all
I'm with it all
Been there, done, and did it all
And what I saw was niggas fall
Once the young whore get the call

[Chorus: 50 Cent]
Bitch what you know about?
Grippin' fo' fo's
Poppin' fo' fos
Pimpin' them hoes
Nigga what you know about?
Gettin' that dough
Pushin' that blow
Sippin' that Mo
Bitch what you know about?

Bitch what you know about?
Grippin' fo' fo's
Poppin' fo' fos
Pimpin' them hoes
Nigga what you know about?
Gettin' that dough
Pushin' that blow
Sippin' that Mo
Bitch what you know about?
