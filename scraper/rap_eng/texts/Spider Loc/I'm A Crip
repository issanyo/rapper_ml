I'm a crip when I lay down
A crip when I'm asleep cause'
A crip when I wake up
A crip in da streetzz cause'
A crip when I hit da club
A crip in da booth cause
I'm a crip at all times
Let cripin' tell u da truth cause'

I'm a crip when I lay down
A crip when I'm asleep cause'
A crip when I wake up
A crip in da streetz cause'
A crip when I hit da club
A crip in da booth cause'
I'm a crip at all times
Let cripin' tell u da truth cause'

[J-Love:]
White tee, blue jeans, gotta sag with em'
Clear jordins' but I got, blue ragzz' I'm em'
6 foot, 2 inches I'm a real crip
Shine like a diamond
See cause' I am bitch
Lay 20's need' I still gotta' baby face
Play me wrong I'll have ya singin' songs like baby face
Smokin' blunts on tha grind is ma dad to day
I'm a diamond so I shine from a mile away
Like a cowboy you'll catch me in dat blue need' grey
Ruff ridin' with gorilla's, you'll get blown away
Try need' front cause, you'll get dumped on in California
Caught slippin' in dat alley like that nigga reapa
I keep it cool but characters got alot to say
They want a crip to slip in traffic need' get washed away
For now I'm slipin' bars, I let em' think I let it ride
Designate that ass at the designated time

[Spider Loc:]
Lay low I'm a crip
But I dun know when tha day was
It turned cool for all these fools to say they cause
It's all true u gotta see me talkin'
I'm sick of these G's I see on tha TV C walkin'
You see I gang- bang like a famous Raymon
Before this rap fame 'ma names bin rangin'
It's like, chhiity-chitty 9 South neighborhood
East side EC land of no pitty
Known for almost fallin' off
But I bounce back ballin'
Takin' aim at anythang that I see wak-wallin' cuzzzz'
Blue bandana, left side blue shoes
Laughin at shit, burnin shirtz on tha YouTube
See - sellin his rope-chain on E-Bay
No brain what can they say about a key-weight
Take shit on a red truck trippin in traffic
Still got tga clip in tha plastic
I'm a crip till 'ma casket

[Lil Boss:]
Blue flag in da bak of ma blue catt
I'm a hood rat
See me comin down that blue hill
Tippin in they 100 bak
Lil boss with dat blue hat, with that H on it
Constantly on ma grind
Most of ma homies they stay on dat
We cappin the cut on tha block cause we play on it
I'm from Houston code and ya tha distrabution
Nigga we pray on dat
My blue steel fill a niggas head with that blue matter
Who fatter, ma blue steel make that nigga's crew scatta'
A old hustla but ain't no new rappa'
I rep cats up in plastic need' show em'
I'm a muthafuckin blue flagger
Strait plate bringa titanium with blue sparkz'
SSD 27 inch need' it got blue partz'
My blue denim' bitch I ride on em'
They say I ain't got no pockets on record
Now he be dem tha died on em'
Why can't these nigga's see I shine on em'
I push tha 9 on em'
Don't waste my muthafuckim time on em'
