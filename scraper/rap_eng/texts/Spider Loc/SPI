He is I and I is he

[Hook]
S-P-I
Known to be so braggedocious
Yes he high
They idolize my (?)
You see him struggling
I fucked around and went up and down
Now watch him shine
The coldest hoes the goldest robes

[Verse 1]
They ain't know what finna happen or not
S-P-I he rapping a lot
But he stay with a strap in the spot
And he scrap and he cap when he hot
He don't listen to no advice
He got that flow and he know its nice
Turned down signing more than twice
Stuck and grinding he know his price
Met him a nigga that understood
He the perfect poet that run the hood
Gave him a chance do all he could
Off my advance like a ball for good
All that leather and all that wood
Sitting on top of all that chrome
Give to the streets all I should
And appreciate all that dough

[Hook]
S-P-I
Known to be so braggedocious
Yes he high
They idolize my (?)
You see him struggling
I fucked around and went up and down
Now watch him shine
The coldest hoes the goldest robes

[Verse 2]
From the top to the bottom back to the top
S.P too active to stop
Just listen to the facts that I drop
On top of the tracks that I chop
I don't choose to lose
Naw partner yous confused
I share the views of (?)
To get tools and views, yous and tunes
(?)
Now my music abusing (?)
I can't lose the news
Paprazzi, jacuzzi pools
Words spit like an uzi ooze
Save wearing pink for them Suzie Qs
I'm not like you boujee dudes
The shit I say is usually rude
