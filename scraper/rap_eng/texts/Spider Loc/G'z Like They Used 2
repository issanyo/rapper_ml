[Verse 1: Spider Loc]

This is from the ourtown nigga, claim your hood
Helped him get his chain back bang on Suge
Told him don't trip we can G-Unit then he tried to
Jump ship and leave you in it
You might beef with the homies but this the turf
You diss G-Unit loc then you diss the turf
I walks with no feelings show no fears
Even if I'm sitting on this shelf for 4 more years
[?] tell them Deebo back you ain't no outlaw
You on C-Bo sacc you might crack, and telling us be easy
You sell your soul if you can just be cheesy
They gonna diss you in the south, might as well let
Baby kiss you in the mouth what you did in the dark
Came to the light then jumped on the phone and wanna
Bang on the mic, and I'm like

[Hook 2x: Spider Loc]

They don't make G'z like they used to
I still squeeze like I used to
I got mo' G'z then I used to
But I still roll this like I used to

[Verse 2: Spider Loc]

To make this go away is gonna take a miracle
All you can say your take was a year ago
I understand you took me to the blood
But I'm a man you must have took me for a dub
Your interview made me so sick, switched up
You on Doja dick?
You said he ain't no blood and you ain't no cuz (remember)
But cuz now its on though it ain't no love
This shit ride like it's supposed to go
I beat the shit out of rap niggas so so know
You must be sueded off the wip
Got kicked off the click and then booted
Off the set, every word that i say on this
Track is true, quit crying i gotta pay taxes too
See the THC level in my eyes?
You must be thinkin SPI is the devil in disguise
I'm like

[Hook: Spider Loc]

[Verse 3: Spider Loc]

It's a shame what this lames will do for some fucking fame
This ain't a fucking game, fuck Buck and Game
I bang that capital letter G (Unit) come on cuz
Had to know better, BAYMAAC gonna blast their mouth gone
Pop either way them Guerillas gonna come out on top
I turned the whole county on the hook
Why you think the only bounty hunter shook
Get your butterfly tat y'all can cry together
Or come where I'm at and y'all can die together
Who lied to Buck? Chuck played you twice, remember trying to
Buy your chain and he raised the price?
I'm the truth its for you all to see
You two goofballs call Snoop Dogg a G (haha haha)
Switched up real quick like, on the set I know my
Nigga Tech like damn
