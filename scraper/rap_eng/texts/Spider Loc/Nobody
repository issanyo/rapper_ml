[Intro]
Yeah yeah
Its coming, its coming
Its on me
Its coming, its coming

[Verse 1]
Drink yak with my blood cousin
He call it Hennebee
Imagine him and me going at our enemies
Mobbed in my house shoes til I got turf toe
That was back when 'fore I got my first folds
Raise my hand high, I swear to tell the whole truth
Count dough day and night like a toll booth
I get coins when I put poems in tunes
Keep the last two Ms. Junes in adjoining rooms
Blast against this its the end of your mission
Not to mention me is like the sin of omission
Cash is established, my habits is lavish
Classic as Cassius Clay, play with the plastic
Known to hold the heater the same way I hold a mic
Leader, rare breed like the niggas on the motor bikes
Give a fuck what you think about me frankly
Think about it hater, later maybe you'll thank me

[Hook]
Now nigga I don't give a fuck I'm riding with the pump, pump
Try a nigga luck and I'll hit you up
I give a fuck 'bout what nobody thinks of me
What nobody thinks of me
I keep a shorty with a mac, 40 on my lap
Braaaapp
If homie wanna act I'll blow him off the map
Give a fuck what nobody thinks of me
Nobody thinks of me

[Verse 2]
Niggas go big on the internet, let 'em keep talking
When I see 'em on the set they better keep walking
If off the offering often, don't say judge
I'd rather (?)
The OG's told us to wizzeigh the wizzork
They was evil but we weighed wizzork
I'm too cool to be confused with these new school fools
Even my soul too cold for the old
No kush better, no flow wetter than mine
Nigga young '97 push the center in line
Reign in every region from northeast to southwest
And the rest, the S just run his mouth best
They say its lonely at the top, that's where I wanna be
I see so many of these cowards, only one of me
Ay go eat a bagel, let go of my Eggo
When I let that K go his eyes start to let go

[Hook]
Now nigga I don't give a fuck I'm riding with the pump, pump
Try a nigga luck and I'll hit you up
I give a fuck 'bout what nobody thinks of me
What nobody thinks of me
I keep a shorty with a mac, 40 on my lap
Braaaapp
If homie wanna act I'll blow him off the map
Give a fuck what nobody thinks of me
Nobody thinks of me

[Verse 3]
Heard she (?) but don't preach forgiveness
Nosy people taught to mind their b-i business
Loose lips sink ships, snitches get stiches
Your word is your bond and you never trust bitches
And I don't care what you say about me
The truth is things wouldn't be the same without me
I'm ruthless, don't care what nobody thinks of me
What nobody thinks of me

[Outro]
I just don't give a fuck what they think
Say what I say
Talk like I talk
(?) talk do that
Now they taught me to weigh the work
Wizzeigh the wizzork do you feel me
It was evil but we weighed work
Wizzeigh the wizzork
