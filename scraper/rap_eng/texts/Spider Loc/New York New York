[Verse 1: Spider Loc]
You can't see me, it's the incredible
Rider from ECG, young reputable
A good excuse is hard to come up with
A nigga just came up hard, I'm corrupted
I'm a hog I like shootin' at pigs
Never mind your vest I like shootin' at wigs
It's gonna take a miracle
I'm evil for spiritual and ever so lyrical
I induce mind states
I drink cognac by the crate tryin' to get my mind straight
Curtis Jackson cut the check
And without Spider Loc tell me what's the west? (a mess)
It ain't what it's 'posed to be
What MC on the coast is coming close to me?
I'm everything that they 'posed to be
Lil T mean the most to me

[Hook: Spider Loc] x2
New York, New York big city of dreams
Who gives a fuck where a nigga from? Gimme the green
I ain't no fool, L.A. my town
But this is hip hop and Fitty the king


[Verse 2: Popa Smurf]
Red L.A. hat, ride through the Bronx
Got 5 blunts burnin' gettin' higher than fuck
Spider hooked me up with this east coast connect
Now I'm going back to Cali with a piece on my neck
Dirty south central, feet off the jet
G-Unit west, I eat off of that
Look at the world different behing them Gucci shades
I swear to God, I won't rest 'til my crew get paid
I put instrumentals in hospitals
So fuck you MCs, I spit for my niggas
On the chirp with some hoes from Jersey
Smurf, I got hoes like a jersey
(What?) Me and my boys
Been wearin' white t's before Dem Franchise Boys
I got the 38 chillin'
Higher than the Empire State Buildin'

[Hoook]
