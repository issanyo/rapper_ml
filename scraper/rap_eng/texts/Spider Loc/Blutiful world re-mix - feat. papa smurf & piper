(feat. Snoopy Blue)

It's a blutiful day in my neighborhood
(feat. Snoopy Blue)

It's a blutiful day in my neighborhood
A blutiful day in my neighborhood
REMIX! ha ha muthafuckas

[Verse 1: Spider Loc]
I'm on the blue mic standin in the blue booth
Got that blue light blinkin on the blue tooth
Blue water, great big blue sky
Blue royal, all kind of blue fly
Blue boxers saggin in my blue jeans
Blue chucks on, fat lace blue strings
Got a jacket thats made out of blue fox
Blue knocks on the back of my blue rocks
Snoopy blue in the cut with the blue steel
We drink blue beast, and pop blue pills
Shoot it out over dope like in Blue Hill
Blue benz on four big blue wheels
Hood rats, blue braids, blue nails
Good cat, got an ass like a blue whale
Spray paint got the hood full of blue walls
Bleed blue blood, and got blue balls

[Chorus:]
Oh, Its a blutiful day
It's a blutiful world
I'm in a blutiful car
And got a blutiful girl

It's a blutiful night
My chain blings blue in the light
I'm blutiful when I grind
I'm blutiful when I shine

[Verse 2: Spider Loc]
Blue berry blunt wrapped
Gettin blue back
Bay mack plaque in the back of the blue 'Lac
Navy Blue long sleeves on my blue tees
Powder Blue knock-offs on my blue dees
Got a blutiful glow from that blue ice
Crack the crack game nice with the blue dice
Light the blunt with the torch and the flame blue
I'm in the fastlane gettin' my brains blewed
Blue kicks look good with the blue fit
I keep a blue choke chain on my blue pit
Stuff a dove worth the buzz in a blue bag
Jumpin' out the blue Jag
With a blue rag
Blue belts, blue hats blue coats
Dont sang but I do hum blue notes
High as a kite all night off the Blue Dolphin
When I go lay me in the blue coffin

[Chorus:]
Oh, Its a blutiful day
It's a blutiful world
I'm in a blutiful car
And got a blutiful girl

It's a blutiful night
My chain blings blue in the light
I'm blutiful when I grind
I'm blutiful when I shine

(You next Snoopy Blue ha ha)

[Snoopy Blue: talking]
Hey hold up Spider, How you gon do a song called " Blutiful World"'
And Snoopy Blue ain't in it? Ca- rip!

[Verse 3: Snoopy Blue]
Everything blue from the shirt, to the shoe to the strings
Rims, to the car earrings to the chain
Yeah I bang
Cuzz you can't tell by the colors?
Snoopy Blue in the blue mink middle of the summer chillin'
My birth stone blue ain't that a trip?
A coincidence, nah I was born a crip
Its a blue fact the house blue, trim blue
And everytime you see Snoopy he in something blue
From Dark Blue, to Sky Blue, Royal blue is mine
Sippin' Blueway easty like the Blue Line
Off a blue Puma never mind the blue rumors
Bumpin' Bobby Blue blowin' on some blue persuin'
This blue money cause them blue dice stay skippin'
Like blue rags get shown when niggas set trippin'
I'm in blue more than ya whole hood nigga
Why you think they call me Mr. Snoopy Blue nigga

[Chorus:]
Oh, Its a blutiful day
It's a blutiful world
I'm in a blutiful car
And got a blutiful girl

It's a blutiful night
My chain blings blue in the light
I'm blutiful when I grind
I'm blutiful when I shine
