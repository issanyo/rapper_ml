[Intro]
Yeah
Its SPI
First again
Y'all fuck with red rags
Its G-Unit West but uh
This is crip

[Verse 1]
I make niggas bleed like blood that drip does
Feed on slugs and that's on crip cuz
Trip for the grip, ain't willing to settle for less
I can't rest if I'm still in the ghetto
Besides ass, ain't much I ain't willing to peddle
I'm guilty 'cause the pots still killing the kettle
Whether its murder 1 or dead in the yellow
On the block with my t-shirt concealing the metal
I don't meddle with them niggas that ain't on point
I smoke blunts these days, I ain't on the joints
Full joint suspensions, annoint the mentions
Like the chief commander, I appoint positions
And you the type of nigga that I make run off
Cause you act too hard and won't take nothing off
But its easy to see when a fake one's soft
And its easy for me to just break one off

[Hook]
All my niggas here do it big
Nigga this crip, that's what it is
All my bitches in here do it big
Shake that shit, that's what it is

All my niggas here do it big
Nigga this crip, that's what it is
All my bitches in here do it big
Shake that shit, that's what it is

[Verse 2]
I flip the track great, sip on the yak straight
Trip the clip in the mac, let it rip through the back gate
Keep the sack in (?) because Cali the crack state
And smoking cocaine is an average black trait
Keep more green than you can find on Shaq's plate
Try to calculate, my stack great
Another day, another dose of dollars
And plus my migo supposed to holler
So I'm on the 110 and I'm eastside bound
It should be cracking on the east by now
I been the most easty on the eastside clown
With the hip-hop belt and the eastside crown
Fucking around on the east I've found
That the shit don't die down on eastside ground
It pop like a panther burrows
You're half a devil
But if you step in my path its trouble
Damn
