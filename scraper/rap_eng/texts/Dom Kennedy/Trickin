(First part)

[Verse 1: Dom Kennedy]
Hear these niggas trickin' on my old hoes, don't do it
I hear these niggas trickin' on my old hoes
Braggin' to your homies 'cause you fucked on her
You owe me 50 thou, owe me 50 thou
Huh, that's tennis shoe money
And I still run this motherfucker
Trendin' topic when I leave the house, like
3000 for the bed, 4000 for the couch
I'm good with the count, I ain't never running out
You needs a little more practice, nigga
We waiting on y'all to slip, like
You know my cousin want that Rollie, homie
Had to tell him wait, had to tell him wait
I know violence ain't the answer
Rather throw the 600$ in the air for the dancers, right

[Chorus: Dom Kennedy]
Ayy, I hear these niggas trickin' on my old hoes
I hear these niggas trickin' on my old hoes
If you won't keep it real, you can't get in
If you won't keep it real, you can't get in
It's over for you hoes, and you suckers
It's over for you hoes, and you suckers

[Verse 2: B. Carr]
I hear you niggas trickin' on my old hoes
You can have that bitch, cause she was bumped up anyway
Met her ass and smashed her at the same day
You know I live like Pac, high, Get Around
Bank account on phone numbers, look who callin' now
Watch how I come up, stun' your mouth, throw in the ground
Too much syrup on my waffles, Louis checker down
And if you can't keep it real, we gon' ask you out
See your main bitch gave me a head, she my ex now
They say money [?]
All this gold on me, I should be under federal
Train your bitch, and all this runs [?] medical

[Chorus: Dom Kennedy]
Ayy, I hear these niggas trickin' on my old hoes
Ayy, I hear these niggas trickin' on my old hoes
If you won't keep it real, you won't fit in, yeah
If you won't keep it real, you won't fit in, yeah
It's over for you hoes, and you suckers
It's over for you hoes, and you suckers

[Verse 3: Hit-Boy]
Pippin' up, Half-A-Mil
Pippin' high, in the hills
With the one you love, but she thot
Just my type, swipe, swipe, swipe, swipe
Peace [?] drippin' wet, like they got baptized
I see you niggas on Twitter, givin' out advice
Got a message to deliver, I'm not fuckin' with y'all guys, no
It's over for you hoes, and you suckers
I can't hit that girl, if she ain't stuck up
You owe me 90 racks, owe me 90 racks
I might just get that and blow it on the pack
I might just get that and blow it on the pack
Tell the waitress at [?] throw it on the tab

[Bridge: Dom Kennedy]
Ayy, I hear these niggas trickin' on my old hoes
I hear these niggas trickin' on my old hoes
Trick, trickin' on my, trick, trickin' on my (old hoes)
Trick, trickin' on my, trick, trickin' on my (old hoes)

[Outro: Tag]
Half-A-Mil...

(Second part)

[Intro: Dom Kennedy]
No matter...
Uhh... ayy, told ya...
No matter where you, at
I'll drop a little verse on it...
Ay, ay, ay, ay, ay
Ay, ay, look

[Verse 1: Dom Kennedy]
She curved me just like the S letter
Tell me how could you mess that up
Yeah, I see other girls at the restaurant
You the one I be hittin' licks with my
Had it rolled already when I picked you up
Just a lil' somethin' for the sick headaches
That organic stuff, the more damage done
You can feel this no matter where you from

[Chorus: ?]
She likes to
Sit down, smoke one
And talk about it
About it...
When we smoke
Glow
Woaaah...
You and I
You and I

[Verse 2: Hit-Boy]
You the type of girl that make me do better
Now, I ain't never tryna mess that up
Loving when you slidin' on me on your break for lunch
Church, please, tabernacle, let me bless that up
I might have to confess my love
Cause you work that shit like a professional
And it's fuckin' with my feelings, baby
Everytime you leave, come right back to me
You made me complete, that shit...
Hope you feel the same way about me, too
I'ma dedicate, Snoop, show you how a gangsta do
Not just talkin', baby I'm all in
Your ass is the softest, you got me all impressed
Love watchin' you get dressed
Don't take this as disrespect, but that pussy the best

[Chorus: ?]
She likes to
Sit down, smoke one
And talk about it
About it...
When we smoke
Glow
Woaaah...
You and I
You and I

[Outro: ?]
You and I
You and I
You and I
You and I
