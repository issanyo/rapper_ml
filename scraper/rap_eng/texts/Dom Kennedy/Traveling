[Chorus]
Styrofoam always poured up
Weed always rolled up
Cup always poured up
Glass always poured up

[Verse 1]
Pulled up out of valet playing Last Name
To the Spanish hut like the Batcave
Scared on the inside, you ain't that brave
Scared on the inside, you ain't that brave
Send that text message through a clear signal
Thoughts in my head of you real sinful
I ain't in a rush, doors liftin' up
I might be good for her
Maybe one day I'll have a set of twins
And be as good as Hov, God let me in
Pop the last advil for the migraine
Went t-shirt shoppin' with my side chain
Truck sittin' high, told her climb in
When I get her open, I'mma dive in
Til then I'm ridin' with my only son
Throw it back like you owe me one

[Chorus]
Styrofoam always poured up
Weed always rolled up
Cup always poured up
Glass always poured up
Styrofoam always poured up
Weed always rolled up
Cup always poured up
Glass always poured up

[Verse 2]
Real Rollie diamonds but the bezel sucks
All I need is my one eye to count this fetti uh
Shopping sprees lasting over several months
Got Crys' in the fridge like it's Ketel One
Sugar Ray Leonard with these jabs (with these jabs)
Caesars Palace shops, couple grand (couple grand)
Never bite my tounge for these snake niggas (haha)
18 karat gold ring, I'mma stay drippin'
The best to never sign and got away with it
Wake up wondering what day it is (day it is)
Got your girl back on her Dom K again
Coldest to ever do it, no mistaking this

[Stevie Wonder]
Lonely one of young so brokenhearted
Traveling down the rigid road of life
Using pharmaceutical extractions
To find the paradise

[Verse 3]
Yeah
So as we conclude our little love story (love story)
I see the police, baby hold my drugs for me
And that's the type of shit we call very loyal
Can Bankhead Bounce but I ain't from Georgia

[Chorus]
Styrofoam always poured up
Weed always rolled up
Cup always poured up
Glass always poured up
Styrofoam always poured up
Weed always rolled up
Cup always poured up
Glass always poured up
