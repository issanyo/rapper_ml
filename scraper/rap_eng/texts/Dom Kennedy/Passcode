[Intro}
Aye
Aye
Yeah, yeah yeah yeah
Aye aye
[Chorus: P-Lo]
She always trying to know my passcode (uh)
Steady trippin on my last hoe (uhh)
Why you wanna go and do all that
Why you wanna go and do all that
She always trying to know my passcode (aye)
Think I'm fucking with my last hoe (aye aye aye)
Why you wanna go and do all that
Why you wanna go and do all that

[Verse 1: Dom Kennedy]
All the boys make you cry and you end up by yourself
Lonely and miserable just like everybody else
If you listen long enough you can hear the ring coming
Type of FICO score that could make a great husband
I be in the bay with the HBKs stuntin'
Trying to come up a few mill right quick
We the only ones that keep it real like this
I said whats been going on you been acting real strange
Went through my cell phone there ain't much to explain
Black Superman thought you was Lois Lane
But now, I don't even look at you like that
When she call, I'm Like imma hit you right back

She always trying to know my passcode
Steady trippin on my last hoe (uhh)
Why you wanna go and do all that (aye)
Why you wanna go and do all that
She always trying to know my passcode (aye)
Think I'm fucking with my last hoe (aye aye aye)
Why you wanna go and do all that
Why you wanna go and do all that

[Verse 2: Dom Kennedy]
She a pimp by blood, not relation
Maybe DM some then replace them
So miss all that, tell me how you buy all that
When you was all at the table frowned up at PF Changs
I was hoping something was up with your Lo-mein
Whats going on you been acting kinda strange
I'm starting to get that same old feeling back in my brain
Saying I ain't do enough
There's not much time these days for the two of us
Plus you think I'm out here living like Lucifer
I ain't gonna say no names

[Chorus: P-Lo] X2
She always trying to know my passcode (aye)
Steady trippin on my last hoe (aye aye aye)
Why you wanna go and do all that
Why you wanna go and do all that
She always trying to know my passcode (aye)
Think I'm fucking with my last hoe (aye aye aye)
Why you wanna go and do all that
Why you wanna go and do all that

Yeah, yeah yeah yeah
Aye aye
She always trying to know my passcode (uh)
Steady trippin on my last hoe (uhh)
Why you wanna go and do all that
Why you wanna go and do all that
She always trying to know my passcode (aye)
Think I'm fucking with my last hoe (aye aye aye)
Why you wanna go and do all that
Why you wanna go and do all that
