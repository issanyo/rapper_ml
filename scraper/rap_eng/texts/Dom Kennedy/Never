Yeah, yeah, Tomorrow I might just get that motherfucking car wash and shit
Drive around all day playing my shit, yeah my shit

[Hook]
I never do much talking, I never do much tricking
I never do no hating, I’m what the game's been missing
I hear you niggas talking, you niggas sound like bitches
I’m all about my riches, I’m open even on Christmas

[Verse 1]
She love the fucking attention, I love to fuck that’s my mission
Maybe we can go fishing, She like that now that’s different
My bartender she from Michigan, truffle fries from the kitchen
Happy hour like fuck it, this how we be living
Where every moment is a picture, spending thousands on fixtures
Money hoes what a mixture, I’m not smoking no swishers
Fuck with me it’s addictive, when I’m gone you gon' miss it
Either way its my pleasure, this is more like a friendship

[Bridge]
I never do no stalking, I never do no tricking
I never do no waiting, I must be out here tripping
I hear you niggas talking, you niggas sound like bitches
I’m all about my riches, I’m working even on Christmas

[Verse 2]
Lakers vs the Pistons, this shirt cost me a ticket
My girl purse is ridiculous, it’s parmesan on my chicken
I dress like I’ve been dealing, a silk shirt when I’m chilling
Moon roof in the ceiling, a hundred proof so she feel it
I see you from my building, together we can make billions
Diamond certified brilliant, this restaurant is Sicilian
Damn I had the best feeling, then you had to catch feelings
She always wear the best denim, I fuck with you, you a real one
Wax be the Brazillian, taxes over a million
OPM till it’s over, Wu Tang’s for the children

[Hook]
I never do much talking, I never do much tricking
I never do no hating, I’m what the game's been missing
I hear you niggas talking, You niggas sound like bitches
I’m all about my riches and I’m open even on Christmas
I’m open even on Christmas
I’m all about my riches and I’m open even on Christmas
