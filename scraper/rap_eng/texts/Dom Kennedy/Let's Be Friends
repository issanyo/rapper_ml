This where the magic happens

[Verse 1: Dom]
This what I'm 'pose to say, forgot what I meant
I'ma buy me a house, so tired of rent
This what I'm 'pose to say: I'm finna be rich
'Bout to buy me a Porsche, hope it come with a bitch
They know me up in Saks Fifth, they know me out on the Ave
This nigga told me that his baby mom in love with me bad
I play that Bobby Brown, LL, Color Me Badd
Man, these little niggas pulled a gun on me, damn
Took my cousin phone, turned off and he ran
A few seconds later I heard "Bam! Bam!"
Shit like that is the norm where I'm at
Niggas ain't got a chance when they born where I'm at
A whole lot of weed is getting torn where I'm at
I talk about hoes cause they be on us like that

Nigga, I say I talk about hoes cause they be on us like that

You say it: We talk about hoes cause they be...

[Verse 2: Dom]
This what I'm 'pose to say, I'm building my brand
I didnâ€™t really fuck up, it was part of the plan
This what I'm pose to say: the game finna switch
I'm taking yo spot, it come with yo bitch
I really wish we could have sex again
Three words I really hate ladies, let's be friends
I really wanna to talk to yo sexy friends
Shit, you and Halle Berry girl, y'all must be twins
You won't see this on ESPN
But this shit is finna jam all across the land
I made it out the jungle, now im up in Japan
Damn these little niggas can't fuck with my band
Fuck sardines, I ain't touchin' that can
Money feel good when it's up in my hand
Sharing with the fam, shit I stuck to the plan
I fuck with you nigga, but what's up with your man?
Make it to the top? Yes we can
And we can start over girl let's be friends

I told my little boy I try my best for him
And the world is now yours son let's begin

The world is now yours son let's begin
The world is now yours son let's begin
Said the world is now yours son let's begin
Other People Money ho let's be friends
Westside OPM, tell em let's be friends
Live from South Central gettin' it in... tell em let's be friends
Who got some weed, who got some Hen, let's be friends

We back again, back again, back again, let's be friends (9x)
