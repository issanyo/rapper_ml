Verse 1:
Uh, uh, uh
I hope you understand that
Oh no, not another player track
She ain't never gave me trouble
I imagine I broke her off, for real, I ain't stutter
Tryin' to be a Hot Boy, like Lil' Wayne brothers
Iron my large White-T, ha !
I just wanna work, get my overtime up
Every time you over? gotta shut the blinds up
...If I use my imagination...
I know she has to hate me
But I like doin' crowds, kissin' clouds, mixin' loud
...I wish you nothin' but the best lady

Size 12 on the gas, ayyyeee..
When I see her silhouette? I can't help but turn my neck
Uh uh uh

I hope somebody takin' care of that
Cuz if they ain't? I'm upset, you alone?, no text
