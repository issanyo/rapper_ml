[Chorus:]

Turn the streets
On any given day to a drag strip
I'm the one
Always looking clean in the parking lot

Turn the streets
On any given day to a drag strip
I'm the one
Always looking clean in the parking lot

You might see me posted up at the 76
I'm the one always looking clean in the parking lot
You might see me posted up at the 76
I'm the one always looking clean in the parking lot

[Verse 1:]

So many whips it's a shame
Puttin' ski racks on the Range
And I don't even got one yet
And I told J Pounds think we got one, yes
Fuck around, I been out in the Ace all week
Sippin' Ace all week
Say somethin' real and be way off beat
Limp to the plate still take y'all deep
With goldies on my Mustang
When I do my club thang
I might push some new shit
You gon need that duck tape
Or I'm in my Old School
Told her yeah it run straight
Seen my nigga Cinco
You know we be up late
AH
Get to this cash
Foot on the gas
Ain't no stoppin' us comin' up
She like oooh they comin' up
You better off with one of us
And with curves like that it's gone take a professional
You need me in the picture, I look better next to you

[Chorus:]

Turn the streets
On any given day to a drag strip
I'm the one
Always looking clean in the parking lot

Turn the streets
On any given day to a drag strip
I'm the one
Always looking clean in the parking lot

You might see me posted up at the 76
I'm the one always looking clean in the parking lot
You might see me posted up at the 76
I'm the one always looking clean in the parking lot

[Verse 2:]

And here we find ourselves back [?] again
Remember life is short no matter what the stage we in
So let's burn rubber til the tires is paper thin
We was made to win
I'm no plagiarist
I do major shit
Who raiding this?
How we get a lake by the house?
Maybe a waterslide in the back?
Maybe a shark tank in the room?
All my favorite beer on tap
All new cars on the grass
Old Schools parked behind glass
1942 in my flask

No spots on the glass
Blowin' a bag
Ain't no stoppin us comin' up
Like we ain't already done enough
These niggas ain't stunted once
And it's very important we get to these decimals
That 9-9-1
It keep me on schedule

[Chorus:]

Turn the streets
On any given day to a drag strip
I'm the one
Always looking clean in the parking lot

Turn the streets
On any given day to a drag strip
I'm the one
Always looking clean in the parking lot

You might see me posted up at the 76
I'm the one always looking clean in the parking lot
You might see me posted up at the 76
I'm the one always looking clean in the parking lot
