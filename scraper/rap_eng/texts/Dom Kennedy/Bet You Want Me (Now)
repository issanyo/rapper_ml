[INTRO]

[Verse 1]
Its kinda funny how life happened
Ladies used to call me quiet, now I'm nice rappin'
Guess the polo turned her on, yeah the nice fabrics
Shit, I remember when you said you didn't like rappers
That California sun turned to night traffic
We just hit that gutter lane and we drive faster
All I hear is "There go Dom" as I drive past her
I don't mind giving my number, if you don't mind askin'
She says she never does but she did this time
Cause she knows what I want
Come up to the show they got yo tickets in the front
But don't tell me you in love when its only been a month

[Hook]
Uh
I bet you want me now baby
Bet, bet, bet you want me now baby
Everywhere I go
She tappin' on her friend like "Yeah there he go"
And uh
I bet you want me now baby
Bet, bet, bet you want me now baby
Everywhere I go
She tappin' on her friend like "Yeah there he go"
And uh

[Verse 2]
Its kinda funny how life do you
All you gotta do is ask and bring it right to you
Looking light skinned baby, looking like Nunu
Spoiled LA girls, i'll give my life to you
I'll just took this time out to write to you
It be so good, I don't wanna say goodnight to you
We so close but I dont wanna say wife to you
There's so many things that a nigga really liked to you
If this wrong, I don't wanna be right to you
I be on my macbook trying skype to you
We both gotta iphone so I can type to you
License got suspended and I got up on that bike to you

[Hook]
Yet I bet you want me now baby
Bet, bet, bet you want me now baby
Everything I do
Make her wonder why she had a nigga like you
And uh
I bet you want me now baby
Bet, bet, bet you want me now baby
Everything I do
Is everything you heard
And everything is true
Uh

[Verse 3]
She playin' on my phone tryin' to fuck with me
But I dont need drama
This rap shit is enough for me
My own friends wonderin' whats up with me
But they don't got enough ambition to keep up with me
And this is from the other peoples company
So write my number down and tell your girl to keep in touch with me
I just bought this dodger hat and some chucks with me
I know you niggas mad now cause everybody fuck with me
I give her 1 week till she fuckin me
I give her 2 weeks till she suckin me
I'll give her 3 weeks till she sick of me
From not returning all them phone calls that were sent for me
I love this game
It was meant for me
Send all them girls, a mojito with a mint for me
I gotta a pocket full of singles and some centuries
And im just out here tryin' to be the man I was always meant to be

[Hook]
Yeah
And I bet you want me now baby
Bet, bet, bet you want me now baby
Everywhere I go
She tappin' on her friend like "Yeah there he go"
And uh
I bet you want me now baby
Bet, bet, bet you want me now baby
Everywhere I'm at
There's always one girl telling me to come back
And uh
