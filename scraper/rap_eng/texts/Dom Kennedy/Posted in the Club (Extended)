[Intro]
It's still in rotation, it's still in rotation
I ain't even had a vacation, you know?
It looks like it's us against everybody else now
It don't matter though cause its OPM time now
And I got somethin' I've been wantin' to play for you
I got this, this new Dom Kennedy
And he gon' let y'all know whats been goin' on

[Verse 1]
'But your last shit dropped in October
And, damn, it's almost January'
Another year in the City of Angels
And I been here the whole time bossed up
Spendin' money on my own campaign, flossed, what?
If they don't know a diamond when they see it, so be it
Tryin' to obtain things people said we couldn't have
Places we couldn't go, now it's all in the past
I just want to keep bein' me and stay authentic
Love, I get a lot from us
So I'm stayin' up every night just to make me happy
Cause if I'm mad, then that make her upset
And that's how I know that she's the one, exactly

[Hook]
And if I meet her today or I know her and it happens
Guess it's true, she's the one, exactly
And if I meet her tomorrow while I'm posted in the club
Wit' a bottle to the neck, come holler at me
Come holler at me, come holler at me, come holler at me

[Verse 2]
I'm for real this time, I'm 'bout to change numbers
I kept gettin' calls from some random shit this summer
It's lookin' like, 'Why you think about it?'
You ain't even have to wonder who is gon' be on top
She ridin' me all slow
Talkin' 'bout, 'Them boys been bitin' you on the low'
They like what you about and the city your represent
I said, 'I do too, so let me just do my shit'
If she nice, then she somewhere on my list
Man, I think she Ben Charles
Got a stand-up every night just to make me happy
Cause if I come home late and that make her upset
Then that means she ain't the one, exactly

[Hook]

[Bridge]
Somethin', I could just hold your waist while we two-step
There's so many sad songs in the world today
Just a little motivation, a little motivation

[Hook] (x2)
