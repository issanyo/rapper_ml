[Intro: Dom Kennedy & Eric Bellinger]
Huh, yeah
Comin' live from the 323
Rock me baby

[Verse 1: Eric Bellinger]
Hand me my grinder (yeah)
Uh, girl, it's time to get away, yeah
Baby, sit back, relax as I put on your favorite songs
You know I got 'em all, yeah
Pass me that lighter
Come with me to outer space, yeah (outer space)
You forget about the shit you dealing with
When we get high, yeah
When niggas make you mad (smoke, smoke, smoke it away)
When everything all bad (smoke, smoke, smoke it away)
(Yeah) let's get blown, first we make love, then we fall asleep and when we wake up

[Chorus: Eric Bellinger & Dom Kennedy]
We'll be staring at the ceiling (so high, so high) (woah)
Staring at the ceiling (drifting away) (yeah, woah)
We'll be staring at the ceiling (sheesh, so high, so high) (woah)
Staring at the ceiling (floating away)
This that sexual healing

[Bridge: Eric Bellinger]
If you need it, girl
I got the key remedies to your body
After you hit that weed
Lay with me and it's over
Make sure you rush right home
After work and I got you

[Chorus: Eric Bellinger & Dom Kennedy]
Then we'll be staring at the ceiling (so high, so high) (know I got the hits for you, baby, ayy)
Staring at the ceiling (drifting away) (ayy)
We'll be staring at the ceiling (sheesh, so high, so high)
Staring at the ceiling (floating away) (it's Dom)
This that sexual healing

[Verse 2: Dom Kennedy]
You look so good, I wanna toast you up
Buy you a [?], that's the side effects of love
Make it sound like sex in club
No matter how upset you was
You still text back, I delivered
And walk you to your door like thriller
You look so good, let's park by the ocean
They was like, "What's all the commotion?"
I keep runnin' out of Trojans
Gold wrappers in the trash bin
Random numbers on napkins
Come on Eric tap in

[Chorus: Eric Bellinger & Dom Kennedy]
We'll be staring at the ceiling (so high, so high) (woah)
Staring at the ceiling (drifting away) (yeah)
We'll be staring at the ceiling ( so high, so high) (woah, let's go)
Staring at the ceiling (floating away) (yeah)
This that sexual healing

[Bridge: Eric Bellinger]
If you need it, girl
I got the key remedies to your body
After you hit that weed
Lay with me and it's over
Make sure you rush right home
After work and I got you

[Chorus: Eric Bellinger & Dom Kennedy]
Then we'll be staring at the ceiling (so high, so high) (woah)
Staring at the ceiling (drifting away)
We'll be staring at the ceiling (sheesh, so high, so high)
Staring at the ceiling (floating away)
This that sexual healing
It's Eazy
