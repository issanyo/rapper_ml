[Intro-Bryan Roberts]
Girl what's ya name

[Verse 1-Skeme]
Look it got S. Dot Holla
2 pockets full of dollas
Horse on the tee
Yellow gold by the collar
Baby I'm a dog half rapper rottweiler
Text a bad bitch get her wet as dog water
Niggas want beef we laughin' like why bother?
Here to get dollars then deuces I'll holla
Got girls losing, they marbles like manchola (?)
West side since I seen Dre dip in that Impala
7 and 11 and I'm snatchin' up ends
Baby it's a Coupe so I ain't ridin' with no friends
James Dean tip, Ray Bans for the lens
Paper chasin' till I'm sleep then back again
Seen one girl seen em' all that's the motto
Raise another glass let her play with that Moscato
After she finish got some game she could swallow
Cut the lights low and lose her phone till tomorrow ha

[Hook-Bryan Roberts]
I saw her once before yeah
I think it was on tour and
We poured champagne and more damn
Girl what's ya name?
I know she on it, on it on it
Whoa whoa
I told the bitch dive in
I know you want it, want it, want it
You might as well jump in

[Verse 2-Dom Kennedy]
Game tight, I hit in the same night
She workin' Jet Blue we flew in the same flight
New drawers, Navy Blue or the plain white
Socks hat, guess I'm reppin' the gang life
Look at me, real nigga in plain sight
Chain nice, I touch it she came twice
We Grey Goose, she hit the room then it's execution
We leave home to the Bay then maybe next it's Houston?
I did a show sold out where my retribution?
If I call you when I'm back that mean the sex was stupid
If you seen me and Skeme bitch the West is movin'
La Merte Park forever we the best to do it
West Side forever gotta rep the movement
I gotta Thank God I been blessed to do it
You niggas fell off I just kept improvin'
Never looked back I just kept it movin'

[Hook-Bryan Roberts]
I saw her once before yeah
I think it was on tour and
We poured champagne and more damn
Girl what's ya name?
I know she on it, on it on it
Whoa whoa
I told the bitch dive in
I know you want it, want it, want it
You might as well jump in

[Verse 3-Skeme]
It go guess whose back in the mafuckin' house?
(You ain't no God damn pimp)
Watch yo' mafuckin' mouth
I stay with pretty women who attracted by winnin'
No games girl I knew you was wit' it from the beginnin'
I like em red, yellow and brown I get around
Somethin' bout the way I get down that keep her round
Somethin' bout the way that I sound that got her wet
And nah I ain't new to this mama see I'm a vet
I'm in them Chuck Taylors but walkin' round with them checks
Socks Gang Mob and she ridin' with the set
Gone without a trace no hickeys on her neck
She trip get replaced she leave I holla next
Brittany and Tiffany both hit me to get wit' me
Hit the room tie up they phones we gettin' busy
Playin' like the homies that hooped that got the jimmy
Girl meet me in them sheets I brought Cran and some Remy what's up?
