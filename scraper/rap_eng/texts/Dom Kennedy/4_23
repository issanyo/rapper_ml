(Dom Kennedy)

Yo
It's Dom Kennedy
It's Tuesday April 23rd
I'm the studio with my homeboy Ricky Hil (ratatatattta)
Yeah
Cousin locked up, homeboy passed last year
Ya nah'm sayin
What I'm gon do?

VERSE 1
(Dom Kennedy)

So I'ma ball for every fuckin day I can
She gon think we go together if I let her hold my hand
Aye
So I don't talk to every little skank I can
No I'm not the rap nigga that you bitches think I am
Uhh
I'm not gon take you where umbrellas in the sand
Won't do you no good, I'm tryna help you understand
Uhh
(??) on some Remy Martin girl, a couple grams
We could go double platinum, start performing with the band
Aye
And I could reach like at least a hundred grand
Through the whole world tour in just a couple pair of Vans
Yeah

CHORUS
(Ricky Hil)

Where you goin rebel man, Where you goin rebel man
(Way Up)
With that pair of Vans on

Where you goin rebel man, Where you goin rebel man
(Stay Up)
With that black pair of Vans on

This girl might need a little help
(I don't know what to say to her)
Just make sure she don't hurt herself
Don't hurt yourself
(Don't hurt yourself)
Don't hurt yourself
No women no cry, As long as I'm high

VERSE 2
(Ricky Hil)

I'ma try to say high every fuckin day I can
I ain't takin you on trips unless you taking your grams
Rick Hil from the Norf, I'm raw
No women cry, I be high like I'm tall
No lie got 5, I just took them all
My Chevy fast outside like Chris Paul
This is Hil from the Ville, I'm the illiest there
Your bitches want my shit, cause the shit I wear
Muhfucka you can't compare
My bitch a peach, Yo bitch is a pear
My bitch a beast, Yo bitch is a bear
I take her on tour two pairs all we wear


Where you goin rebel man, Where you goin rebel man
(Way Up)
With that pair of Vans on

Where you goin rebel man, Where you goin rebel man
(Stay Up)
With that black pair of Vans on

This girl might need a little help
(I don't know what to say to her)
Just make sure she don't hurt herself
Don't hurt yourself
(Don't hurt yourself)
Don't hurt yourself
No women no cry, As long as I'm high

(Ladada dadada)

Where you goin rebel man, Where you goin rebel man
With that pair of Vans on
Where you goin rebel man, Where you goin rebel man
With that black pair of Vans on

This girl might need a little help
(I don't know what to say to her)
Just make sure she don't hurt herself
Don't hurt yourself
(Don't hurt yourself)
Don't hurt yourself
No women no cry, As long as I'm high

(Ladada dadada)
