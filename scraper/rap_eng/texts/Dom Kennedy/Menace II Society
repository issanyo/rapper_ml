[Verse 1: Freddie Gibbs]
Slammin', Freddie pull up in some '84 shit
Wrote this flow while smoking on dope, so call me the dopest
Crush these niggas feelings, then come right back in some mo shit
Different colors diamonds, I'm about to stunt on my old bitch
And slide out...
Black Macs and Cadillacs when we ride out
Man these bitches gon' stay attached when I slide out
We relax and take 'em back to my hideout
Big stacks, give me the racks when I ride out
Black Macs and Cadillacs when we ride out
Man these bitches gon' stay attached when I slide out
We relax and take 'em back to my hideout
Big stacks, give me the racks when I ride out
East Gary Indiana, bitch I'm puttin on
Get my weed out on the west cause that's my second home
Before you try to check a nigga, check out who you checkin on
Robbing on my resume, bitch I'm invading homes
Niggas call me Freddie Forgiato, I'm on low pros
Can't be sleepin on these streets, bitch it's no doze
Shouts out to the gang bangers, cain slingers flippin o's
Piru's, Hoover's, 8-tre's and 6-O's
Ride out
Plenty bitches got em undressin in my hideout
Bet she wishing I got her pregnant once I slide out
All my bitches is perfect 10s, nigga dime'd out
Keep it goin until her baby daddy find out
Keep a weapon, I'm never stressin
Shout out to G Malone, Jay Rock and 211
The peoples say my potna's is killers, menaces, dope dealers
Gangsta Gibbs, just a neighborhood thug nigga

[Hook: Freddie Gibbs (& Polyester the Saint)]
Ride out...
Black macs and cadillacs when we ride out
Man these bitches gon' stay attached when I slide out
We relax and take em back to my hideout
Big stacks, give me the racks when I ride out
(How about you and I
Hit the sky
Let's take a ride
Come on let's go)
Big stacks, give me the racks when I ride out

[Verse 2: Dom Kennedy]
Gold D's and purple trees, let me fire up
Red Bull and Grey Goose til we wired up
She tell me she wanna see me, but I'm tied up
Shit I got a personal driver, put ya ride up
Yeah, a nigga shooting them dice, put ya five up
Say what we doin tonight, make ya mind up
Look I got this lil Cristal to get you out of them drawers
I'mma keep it raw
After I do hit, I'm probably never'll call on some rap shit
Yeah I used to work at the mall on some black shit
Selling these hoes clothes, I'm a mack bitch
Can't you tell in my flows?
Gold rings on, Chanel Platinum all in her nose
That's my theme song
And you can't play the homies cause the team's strong
Girl we can't do nothin with them jeans on, on
So let them legs slide out

[Hook]

Big stacks, give me the racks when I ride out
You and I
Hit the sky
Let's take a ride
Come on let's go
