[Intro]
Same thing (yeah)
Back and forth
Same thing
Same thing
Back and forth it's the same thing

[Verse 1: Dom Kennedy]
You love me then you hate me, then you love me (hah)
My eyes ain't on rap, it's the country
Shit, Hillary Rodham was the 45th
Until ya'll let em know niggas true intent
Fuck your advance money, I made her dance for me
Benz ashtray full, I'm half baked
Still can't believe I crashed the cabriolet
Layed up in the bed watching Training Day
Two gats like Lonzo, take that
You wanna be from LA, you gotta pay a tax
To me I'm brown skin but they call us black
Get caught slippin, you gon' take a nap
Police ain't the only one with handcuffs
Dunkin' on niggas and get the And-One
Yeah, real men water they plants, bruh
Serve free breakfast like a Panther

[Chorus]
You better watch them niggas that's close to you
And make sure they do what they supposed to do
Cause you know they been thinking bout
Never personal, nowadays it's the ways

[Recitative: Cuzzy Capone]
Yeah, you know
Everybody come from somewhere different
But at the end of the day, we all in the same struggle

[Verse 2: Cuzzy Capone]
Yeah, daily I be on my paper route
I graduated from that vacant house
I was sellin' rocks on a dirty couch
Slauson Ave, where most don't make it out
I had to hustle back and forth
Making plays off of granny porch
Louboutin sneakers with the khak' shorts
I'm a product of the street but I ain't ask for it
My pockets full of dead presidents
All the hating is irrelevant
God's gift, yeah I'm heaven sent
We risk our life just to pay the rent
Ulysse Nardin with the eel skin
Part of South Central where they kill men (East Side)
We take a lot of losses but we still win
Nowadays ain't no such thing as real friends

[Chorus/Outro]
You better watch them niggas that's close to you
And make sure they do what they supposed to do
Cause you know they been thinking bout
Never personal, nowadays it's the ways
Yeah
How far you go in life, it's all based on your decisions
For what it's worth, keep living
You better watch them niggas that's close to you
And make sure they do what they supposed to do
Cause you know they been thinking bout
Never personal, nowadays it's the ways
