[Verse 1]
Uh
Inglewood gon' stand up
Yep, the man tough like handcuffs getting jammed up
Hoping off that Peter Pan buzz with a damn slut
Had the man fuck in a tan truck
But he never called back, caught that
Send a text said "she wasn't 18" "yeah, what?"
Hit Johnny Law FBI CIA in the Klan Klux
Yeah and now you wanted my nigga
And that's what you wanted my nigga
Idolize the inmates till the court date come
Yeah that's where you going my nigga
Used to have skills for the green for the L
Now I write mail for like 15 and L
We dreamed of sales and tracks, raps on CD's
Now reading books in that cell
Now you asking me to send naked pics of my new bitch
Cause I told you my bitch half asian
I never get locked up, but the cops come up
Best believe I'mma go out blazing, two L's like in hell
I inhale, they exhale
Then excel to a level where my niggas see from jail
Like whats up?

Hook:
I know it's hard to grow when your city hating
And the bitch you fucked want you to make it
And when you broke as fuck it's hard to be patient
The key to life is working harder than your situation
Work harder than your situation
They key to life is working harder than your situation
But when you broke as fuck it's hard to be patient
They key to life is working harder than your....
Man hol' up

[Dom Kennedy]
Bless the weed then we smoke up, it's a dope cut
All crack nigga no cut
Damn know what? I thought you're my bro
But you don't really wanna see a nigga blow up
Nigga grow up, yeah, my rims is crawlin'
I'm knocking the boots, the timbs is callin'
It's OPM we just in here ballin'
I fuck her on the phone while her friends is callin'
Just text or somethin', groupie hoes always tryna get next to somethin'
No way these girls keep looking at me
Damn, I must be what's next or somethin
No flexing or nothin', you stole my style, arrest this son...
I been rapping since '08 my nigga
I can make the best of somethin'
I'm the best is your best assumption
Money comes with happiness
If you can't have integrity and be rich, I'mma take half of it
Niggas rhyme so immaculate
Threaten me and I'm packing it
I'm spending money and stacking it
Might buy a car on accident

Huh, and now you wanted my nigga
And that's what you wanted my nigga
We not that deep, but everybody in the clique down
That's what I ever wanted my nigga
Before I go to sleep, pray the Lord never make me weak
I'd rather a G wagon then a Jeep
I like good girls, but I rather she a freak
And my nigga Shawn Chrys on the beat
Preach
