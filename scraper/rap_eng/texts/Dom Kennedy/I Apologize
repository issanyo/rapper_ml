[Dom Kennedy Speaks]

Welcome, welcome, welcome everybody, we doin this all the way live from Leimert Park California tonight, please put all tips in the jar, all tips in the jar, I brought my man poly tonight to help me out, yeah

[Verse 1]

The first we went to eat you know it transpired
I had to heat that ass up like a campfire
My other girl tell me im wrong but I'mma stand by her
And I know you wasn't out wit michael you a damn liar
Im knowin mostly I ain't right but damn I am trying
And there's a good nigga inside but man I can't find em
I do be stylin on these hoes and well they ain't blinded
They like international niggas and well I stay flyin
She fell in love the night she caught me on that stage rhymin
She turned around I walked up and told her
"Hey I am, well huh, you could use my government
Dom is getting famous now I already had enough of it"
My niggas get the good girls, I just get ot fuck a bitch
Some niggas want this lifestyle, I don't get the just of it
My ex is callin right now, we shouldn't be discussing this
I tell you your my only one, you really don't be trustin it
Gotta couple secrets locked, I don't want you bustin it
So when I leave my phone somewhere, I don't want you touchin it
I swear I love you so much, I don't want you suckin it
Questions bout condoms, I just get to duckin it
Cheatin ain't fun though, I just get the rush of it
It wasn't how it looked then but honestly I must admit
Comma, to whom it may concern
Damn this boy is good hearted and soon it may emerge
Its way more then its surface like the moon they say its curved
But until that day arrives her iTune will play that N.E.R.D
Cause I know how you feel, I really think you doesn't
You said that you would wait for me, I really knew you really wasn't
Whats up with the new guy I heard he do construction
You couldn't make my party huh you knew I threw that function
You fuckin wit my homies now you knew I knew a Justin
I just hope you happy though whatever you come up wit
I ain't send no love yet, I'm just cool wit justin
Besides you like fancy spots, I'm just cool wit Truxton's
I don't know what it was, I just knew it wasn't
Cause you the flash ya lights type and I dont do the clubbin
Right after the 2nd date, I don't move to husband
And you could probably tell by now I wasn't to accustom
To takin responsibility, im talking chivalry
And im apologizing to any girl that had to deal wit me
Fuck being real wit you, I'm just bein real wit me
We could make a home love, you just gotta build wit me
I dont need that loud shit, you just gotta chill wit me
If life's a bumpy road, it's a lotta hills wit me
Never let em see you sweat, it's a lot concealed wit me
I wanna do it the right way, it's a lot enstilled in me
And still wit me is the very first time you said you will
But all I guess I really wanna know is if you still me

[Hook: Polyester]

It's a shame, the way I messed around with ya heart, It's a shame, I'm so sorry (x2)

[Dom Speaks Part 2]

Still miss me? Nah, I wouldn't if I was you either, I finally made you a record though, oh it's not what you had in mind? (laughs) If I could take it all back I would, but I can't, and you are who you are, because of the things I did, I think about it all the time, sometimes, I just wish we could start over... Guess I'll see you next lifetime
