[Verse 1:]

Yeah, yeah

It's a house in Malibu, 13 million on the beach
I'm thinking one day, it might could be me that turn the key
Don't share my same vision, a view, of the ocean is a must
And i pray, every day, that the condoms they don't bust

I'm bout my money (bout my money)
And that don't got shit to do with trust
Remember Pharcyde?
That don't got shit to do with us

So if you pass me by baby then baby don' t come back
Cause I'ma do that ass wrong, and you don't want that
Unless you do, yes you do, lets get it poppin', get it poppin'
Yeah you do, yeah you do, I think I found her, think I found her

[Chorus:]

Nice skin, butter pecan
Girl you badder than Bébé's Kids
Body all kind of thick
Already know that you shit

Her features big, Xtra Large
Not from doing exercise
They bouncin' and I ain't surprised
Everybody got they eyes on you

Everybody got they eyes on you
Everybody got they eyes on you

[Verse 2:]

So you mean to tell me you got all dressed for nothing?
Don't wanna talk no more i was drinking by myself
Thinking the whole time we should be linked up
Maybe a pink tux like, I ain't gon say it

That cologne from CVS, nah I ain't gon spray it
New whips valetin', bad chicks I'm slayin'
Big chips Im playin' she sucking dick I'm stayin'
I might hit in the AM so you could party all night

Gave her the room number by the Wharf
You fuck with OPM?
She said “of course”
And I could really hear it in her voice
She would've did anything I said
But I'm at dinner with you instead
What that say about you?

[Chorus:]

Nice skin, butter pecan
Girl you badder than Bébé's Kids
Body all kind of thick
Already know that you shit

Her features big, Xtra Large
Not from doing exercise
They bouncin' and I ain't surprised
Everybody got they eyes on you

Everybody got they eyes on you
Everybody got they eyes on you
