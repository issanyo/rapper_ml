[Intro/Skit]

"& you know like I used to have to fight in school & I used to have to run home cause they'd go get big brother on me. So uh, I start saying you know "FUCK THAT"! Uh, I Can't be running home! You know cause if I get ran home...my mama make me fight! Cause if I lose that fight...that mean SHE gon' whoop my ass! So I HAD to win! That way I wouldn't get two ass whoopings! Cause if I get beat up, my MAMA gon' whoop my ass for losing the fight! So I started...you know, actin' crazy" [Fade]

[Bridge 1: Dom Kennedy]

Yeah [x's 2]
Was running through the hallway and shit
Aye

[Verse 1: Dom Kennedy]

Run up on me, it's gon' be case closed
Head one the swivel cause' you never know
I know a miracle, one thats locked down
One hour on the yard ain't enough, no!
I like to exercise my spirit
White jeans in the winter, ya'll don't hear me
APC on top, gotta bleed em'
I'm like pac in some neighborhood Adidas
& my ambition as a rider just too real
I mean I didn't learn much, kill or be killed
Watch for sudden movements, cause they plotting
Move you out the way to get the profit

[Verse 2: Ray Wright]

Remember rocking hand me downs, yeah the same clothes
Got that Stussy & the Gucci, bitch the game chose
LA fitted nigga, never rock no Kangol
OPM, flooding in, G'd up, in my same post
Blowing Kush, fuck em' good, lately I been layin' low
Cause I been on the road nigga, 50 days, 30 shows
Champagne, campaign, dripping nigga, head to toe
Thats the PÃ©rignon, you don't muhfuggin' hear me doe
No, no, no they can't stop me
All these hoes be outta pocket
Sad to see a real nigga give up
Call it what you call it but can't call it luck

[Chorus: Dom Kennedy]

Dooooon't, fuck w/ me [x's 3]

Get outta town

Dooooon't, fuck w/ me [x's 3]

Get outta town

[Verse 3: Dom Kennedy]

I wish you never landed here, erase the print
Leave the natives alone you greedy bitch
Leave Haiti alone you greedy bitch
Keep a small pocket, keep a trade agreement
Slaves work for you, you gotta pay these people
Might win a trophy at the ESPYS
Deposit on time, that's a blessing
Turquoise paint, it's a antique

[Outro: Ray Wright]

Now you cannot, you cannot, you cannot know
Fuck w/ a player that's all in control
Flying to islands that's only remote
Benz or that Bentley, it's gon' be a boat
Aye


[Chorus]


[Outro to fade]
