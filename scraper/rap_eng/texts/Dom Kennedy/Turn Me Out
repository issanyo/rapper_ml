[Intro]
I went off backstage and I seen her lil frame
She could tell it was me by the smell of Vera Wang
I told her get her money cuz' she know I do the same
And she came back to me so I know she noticed game

[Hook]
And the best of champagne is what we all about
I could come through to the party unannounced
You don't smoke good if you ain't fuckin' with a ounce
And she saying "Can you-Can you-Can you-Can-you turn me out?"
She hate a nigga guts but she keep me in her mouth
I got 20 Gs that I'm keepin' in the couch
I put 10 on me when I'm leavin' out the house
And she tell me "Can you-Can you-Can you-Can-you turn me out?"

[Verse 2]
I walked from the bar then I walked to the car (Come on)
You know who we are, girl I see you lookin' hard (Hard)
Please talk to me like you talkin' to a star
If there ain't no spot in front, I'm just parking in the yard
I been with you all day damn it's only gettin' dark (Ugh)
I think it's 'bout time that we take yo' legs apart
Fuck a tattoo, I'm embedded in yo heart
And I knew I was gon' get you, yeah I said it from the start
You got such a cool shape to have such a small waist (Waist)
If I could have a plate I'd just need a small taste (Taste)
Somehow I never even really have to chase
I'mma get it on-tape so you can't say it was rape

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
I was like "Yeaaah!" she was like "Uhhhh!"
Phone still ringing, I'mma hit you when I'm done!
Tell your homegirls come and get you when you done
Shit I like nasty girls, they can get you with they tongue
It was like Menace, seen her in a Civic
I asked for them digits, man it only took a minute
On my way to work, so I called when I was finished
Told her "Meet me out in Venice" and you know that she was with it!
No relationships girl, I just wanna hit it like
Get it....get it....get it...get it ugh (Haha)
And we don't ever say no names
I got money, game, couple chains

[Hook]
