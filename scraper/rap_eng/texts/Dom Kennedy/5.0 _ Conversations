[5.0 - Hook]
Flowmasters, top down
Gold Daytonas, I ride around

(When we in my 5.0)

[Verse 1]
Swap Meet, Venice Beach
You looking broke, not me
I’m riding big, I’m shining big
I hit her phone, come by the crib
We in the pool, I slid it in
I slid it in, I slid it in
I take a quick shower then hit again
That fat chocolate ass is like m&m's
I got red hoes, I got yellow bones
This the yellow album, rocking yellow stones
OpM is the new Roc-A-Fella holmes
My niggas in DC be rocking hella foams
I get my grind on, in different time zones
Man, counting all this money got my mind gone
I feel like Derrick Rose, in the rarest clothes
$400 for the jeans, I bought two pair of those
Y’all be sharing hoes, we comparing hoes
I told her start working out; I’m just preparing hoes
For the limelight, get yo mind right
You still buying Louis bags, bitch you all hype
White, Black, Asian, fat, I got all types
As long as they riding we’ll be all right

[Hook]

[Conversations Intro]
Ok callers, we gone go ‘head and open up these phone lines
I need y’all to call in and let me know what y’all wanna hear tonight
If you with somebody, you want me to put something on, we gone do that for you
Right now what we gone do though, I’m a need everybody to call in
If you ain't got nobody we need everybody to describe they perfect person
And what would you say to that perfect person if given a chance
How important is conversation?

[Hook x2]
I need an interview; I’m tryna get down with you
I need an interview; I’m tryna get down with you
I need an interview; I’m tryna get down with you
Get down with you, get down with you

[Verse 2]
Yo, call Tisha phone
Play this while you sleep so you never really sleep alone
I’m keeping on to the break of dawn
If the pussy tight stopped at the light
Bagged your wife caught her looking twice
She said “yea Dom go head boy you looking right”
Know I got my stripes I could never live a rookie life
Still tryna get up in the nookie plus her cookies nice
She give me private shows and don’t have to pay the booking price
Tasha wanna give me 2 mil for the booking rights
If I lived in New York I’d probably be the Brooklyn type
Niggas from the hood don’t be acting all shook at night
Tattoo tears and niggas never even took a life
I swear to y'all niggas nowadays don’t be looking right
It's girls in the kitchen that don’t be cooking right
With so much drama from my old Bm
It’s kinda hard being from this fucking OpM
And that’s real

[Hook x2]
I need an interview; I’m tryna get down with you
I need an interview; I’m tryna get down with you
I need an interview; I’m tryna get down with you
Get down with you, get down with you

[Outro]
You know what I’m saying? Now look at me
Now look at me you know when I was little I used to hop in my dad’s
Back then they would have the little 325’s, you know stuff like that, them type of cars
You would hop in and be like man, look at the leather, look at the buttons
This is it, this is living it
That didn’t seem that long ago and now it’s like
My dad get in my car and man this is like being in a jet
