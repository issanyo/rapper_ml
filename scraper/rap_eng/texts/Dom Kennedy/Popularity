[Intro]
Yeah, legend of the fall
Hotter than summer
I can see it in your eyes
You starving for that new Dom Kennedy

[Verse 1]
You been on my mind since we met, love
So nasty they forgot what triple X was
I put two fingers up and all the experts
With Dom K she do her best work
In my world they judge a man by his net worth
Teach him how to buy clothes, not invest first
Chain hanging on my Gosha sweatshirt
The Grey Goose in my system make the Benz swerve
Don't change who you are for popularity
If she trippin' just let her leave
No shame in my game, I'ma let it be
Keep everything so letter G
She asked me how I know so many strippers
She asked me how I know so many strippers

[Chorus]
We been gettin' it in
We been gettin' it in (we have)
We been gettin' it in
Shit, I ain't gone front (no)

[Verse 2]
Since Troy Aikman, I been penetrating
Got authentic tags on my jerseys
2 a.m. but to me it's still early
And sometimes fine bitches curve me
I don't get upset, I get massages
And 12 packs of Hanes socks at the Target
Been hit Balenc', told em charge it
Stacks was against me cause I'm dark skin
Me and number 7 in the same boat
I love Malcolm X too, I got the game sewn
I don't got to sell shit to get my chain froze
Diamond in the ruff, ya'll rainbows
I got on all black with these Stan Smiths
Don't make me have to hop another damn fence
Have me on the ropes but I'm Cassius
Pink Ace of Spade, no glasses

[Chorus]
We been gettin' it in
We been gettin' it in (we have)
We been gettin' it in (haha)
Shit, I ain't gone front (no)

[Outro]
