[Intro]
Huh, woah
Yeah

[Verse 1]
Everybody that know me, know that I be chilling
With the 6 figure cars in the hood, parked in the village
[?] they plan, champagne spilling
I just wanna go and talk she think I'm tryna hit
Step up the BPM thats what I recommend
Tongue kiss and good weed is what I recommend
Fulfilling your fantasy soon as you think of emâ€™
Hard to believe that this girl even got me  [?]

[Chorus]
Every time she call
Every time she call
Every time she call, we hang out

[Verse 2]
I be getting home at 6
Working late nights for real
Tryna live life for real
I just seen a crib worth 45 mill
Kinda hard to explain to this young bitch, she just wanna chill
Hugo Boss [?] huh
We don't all speak the same language
Spent 30 racks on this frame work
I'm gucci even if we got the same shirt
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
We hang out
