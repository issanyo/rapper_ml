[Verse 1]
I be that nigga always wearing something clean for the groupies
Looking like Caine but nah this is a not a movie
Cell phones up, tell them girls to shoot me
All I hear is "yea bitch that's Dom can you excuse me"
Leimert Park legend, I used to bump that Snoopy
Had some iceberg and I used to want that Coogi
Back in 97 man my uncle wore the Gucci
And he rocked Polo, and he wore the Stussy
I am no marine but these niggas do salute me
Catch me on Pico, I am like the Lucy's
Give it to em raw, I am like the sushi
I hate how rappers use the term "fresh" so loosely
Bad ass nigga, I am like Boosie
But that just might have went over yo head like a kufi
If I was a DJ, I would be Brucie
Or any of them niggas Biggie shouted out on "Juicy"
Sometime I get chose, but you can say I'm choosy
And if you want to keep her then you should not introduce me
25th hour, that was introducing
Roll wit the winners girl cause I ain't into losing
Talking Crenshaw king, that's what we be cruising
Get my point across, so I never have to prove it
Squab wit a nigga, I ain't into shootin
This is not the army but them niggas is recruiting
Hardwood floors, but we don't be hooping
When them boxes touch touch down, then we gon' move it
Maybe out to Compton, just like St. Louis
Sugar 16's, nigga watch how I do this yeah I studied this game
I'm a student, but now everyday they call my name and I be truant
UCLA, I'm a bruin
And all them plans you made, I'm a ruin
Your whole rap career, it is ruined
And everybody say "damn Dom you shouldn't do it"
I'm the number one pick, that's Ewing
No one said I would make it, but somehow I always knew it
And I'm running this game, that's stupid
I write like Eric, yeah that's ruthless
These hoes so Ashanti, that's foolish
I'm good on the track, Carl Lewis
All these rap critics always asking for some new shit
Tell em go buy it and they never do shit
I fuck with FutureStreet, but dawg this my new shit
You say I'm bout to really B-L-O-W shit

[Hook x2]
In 1997, I wrote my first rhyme
"I wanna marry you" is what I told my first dime
Had my first drink, rolled my first dime
And I knew I was that nigga for the very first time

[Outro]
Said and I ain't never left, I tell em I ain't never left
Just tell em I ain't never left, tell em I ain't never left
