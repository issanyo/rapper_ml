Want a beat like this
I never thought I could sound street like this
Make top plays of the week like this
And it ain't just rap boy, I speak like this
I eat like this
I'mma get my pockets so deep like this
I'm heavy as a muthafuckin Jeep like this
And im comin' in your lane beep beep like this
I'm in your seat like this
This is how rappers get released like this
It's never been the rapping that competes like this
Yellin: Just be cool I come in peace like this!
I got my name like this
EA-Sports, im in the game like this
Why you do them strangs' like this
We dont tie Chucks, we let 'em hang like this
Try and buy my own thing like this
Barack couldn't even bring change like this

I'mma die like this
I work my way up to the sky like this
I get by like this
I'm good on the white, I get high like this
I'm so live like this
How have I never been in Vibe like this
I dont know a nigga that can scribe like this
And you ain't probably heard nothing since Tribe like this
Shirt and tie like this
I been going hard since five like this
I'm on the rise like this
I make it so easy to decide like this
Me minus him you divide like this
And we go red carpet you alive like this

I turn her on like this
We be on our six in the morning like this
Another girl scorned like this
Nothing happened to me, I was born like this
Ralph Lauren like this
L.A. had been live, since the Forum like this
I shouldn't be scoring like this
I should run the team Rod Thorn like this
We pop like corn like this
Everything I drop like storms like this
Do not like warm like this
This is me in another form like this
Her skirt gettin' torn like this
We can make our soft porn like this
Her body I adore like this
I'mma tear it up, she can moan like this

In Memory Of
It's been a few months, you remember me love?
