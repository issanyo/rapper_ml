[Sample: The Sylvers - Let It Be Me]

[Verse]
We deserve all that we've received
We wrote our own stories
This is the part I chose to be
Let them niggas follow
In my heart, I chose to lead
And on my mothers couch in the dark
I wrote to beats
Two windows, some motherfucking pillows
I'm trying to picture me sitting next to Jay Leno
I pull up on my ex in a limo
Three girls with me, look like [?] in the limo
Yo, is that Kanye West in the limo?
Nah, that's just the future of the west in a limo
I remember DJs with dry wax on them
Now we got rap stations with no raps on them
You could buy a whole album with no facts on them
Watching BET don't make you motherfucking black, homie
Let's take this motherfucker back, homie
All motherfucking black on me
Chuck D shit, Pirate fitted P shit
911 ain't never did nothing for me shit
Even in the dark I still see shit
That 'never give up, always gotta believe in me' shit
That 'get money, they don't fall from a tree' shit
Even when they told me I was never gonna be shit
I packed up, wore my little act up
Had the instrumentals on before I even backed up
We was in the studio so motherfucking jacked up
I didn't even know the vocals had to be stacked up
I didn't even know the track had to be tracked up
Play it in the party like:
"Yeah, nigga, that's us!"
So many girls in the spot, we was lapped up
Way before iPods, dog, we was macked up
Ass smack who had [?] smacked up
Ladies love Dom, and it ain't no motherfucking backups
You Matt Cassel ass niggas
Capital One credit, no hassle ass niggas
Honest, sometimes I feel malice
Thinking about what happened to my younger cousin Alex
He lost his life for a gang that he wasn't down with
So now I walk around on some head down shit
Like, damn
They took my nigga away from us
My sister called, said "They shot him in the face, brother"
That's why I hate summers

I shouldn't even want to fuck with you [x4]
