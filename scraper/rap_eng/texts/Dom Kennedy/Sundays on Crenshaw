[Verse 1:]
I ain't say i am going to keep a 38 for nigga
I’m starting to lose all my respect for niggers
This be online but not my facts
I wen to simple house and got a shade
Over 10 thousand hours kids that's what it takes
I’m really thinking about turning off my motor
Hit the boulevard where they have the lolos
Some days on Cranshaw but not for lobo
Boy you against us that's a no no
You make me sick i stay in the zone though
Fuck it i know my thing make me see my polo
Why you gotta be so materialistic
Niggers talking down cause their bitches listening
I’m not the one you want to be hating on homie
It's not really nothing take the bait on younging
I’m the only one up here that can break a nigga
You are going to make me open up the safe my nigga
This is not really a close race my nigga

[Verse 2:]
The real legend part get real my nigga
I’m going to run the next millennium watch
I was there before the new millennium why
Now niggers going to be saying they feelin my style
I’m good on the lot I’m good on the block
They jokes ain't funny and the hood ain't broke
So everyone want to hit me with the legal approach
I’m going to come out so i stayed
You don't know what that means so let me explain
I was never scared of niggers that bang
I just never want to shoot but change
Black live matter hashtag that da and all that chatter
I’m in her bladder whispering in her ear
Ain't nobody badder they whisper on the radio

[Verse 3:]
You know my status long hills too Campton's Valley
From feeling them adams all the way from the apple
But I’m on next to some positive stuff
So many judges man with some positive stuff
Niggers ain’t even going to no college or nothing
Dont fuck with me boy it got to be dozen
I’m scoring two 8 easy it's time to be up
All we gotta do is hit the bank and re up
And then go to another bank and re up
I want to apologize for shitting be up
If you hate that then bless your soul
I’m going to still be here ice cold for gold
Get my shit clean no i don't want to lean
You should have seen it coming but you don't want to be
Trying to be hard man niggers they be soft
But they don't want to be them selves man they want to act like God’s
I’m here to take what left my nigga
Yellow pole tools got to rest my nigga
Go and get a job at UPS my nigga
Get insures get you a ford
Find a board write your plans
Don’t respect me in your life again
All about now is nikes and lam
I had a melt down before i even begin
This is OPM shit you were never built for
Next time you see me on a billboard that will be your honour
