[Dom Kennedy: Verse 1]
We grew up quick
Talking bout the ones I grew up with
Some Blood, some threw up Crip
We all got gifts
Some just don't ever get found
You wouldn't know cuz you ain't never around
I'm heavy with vows
Cameras on and I'm ready to smile
And let the world see the ghetto with style
If I was a child I would hope to understand the future is now
You look good in a cap and a gown
He ain't no thug
He don't really wanna see no judge
He just can't keep his feet out the mud
You better watch yo step
I got your back you should watch yo self
You can't make it out without no help
We grew up proud
South central man we grew up wild
Leimert Park I guess you up now
That's all I hope
You was down when we was all out broke
You my nigga bro
That's all I know

[Hook]
If the last time I see you is at the end of the night
You gone be my nigga for life
I said we in this wrong world trying to make things right
And you gone be my nigga for life
Just know theres two of us on yo head if we get in a fight
Thats why you know my nigga for life
So if I don't make it home at the end of the night
You still gone be my nigga for life

[2pac speaking]
Thats what they wanna do, thats what they wanna do
Because now everybody is shell shocked and we having trauma
We be having traumatic nights always
I wanna get away from L.A
You wanna get away from it but you can't
Thats what they taught me
The streets didn't teach me that Thug Life live or die
The world taught me that
I thought I could retire and move on
When I moved on into the so called the real world
The civilzed world
These motherfuckers is worst than the niggas in the streets!

[Dom Kennedy: Verse 2]
Don't say my name
Westside we don't play no games
We getting money girl it ain't no thang
Can't you tell
We came up when they thought we would fail
I can't picture you just sitting in jail
Lets make that switch
I know a way we can all get rich
It's on paper and it's all legit
You can't make it if you never commit
My first song shit it wasn't a hit
You see I ain't quit
Now my money go as high as a fence
And I ain't never coming late on the rent
I see the moms drop they kids off at school each day
I hope they learn something new each day
Yeah between the liquor stores, gun fights, gangsters, and cops
Its so hard to make it off these blocks
But you gone raise a King baby girl just watch
Keep going please
Don't ever stop

[Hook]
If the last time I see you is at the end of the night
You gone be my nigga for life
I said we in this wrong world trying to make things right
And you gone be my nigga for life
Just know theres two of us on yo head if we get in a fight
Thats why you know my nigga for life
So if I don't make it home at the end of the night
You still gone be my nigga for life
