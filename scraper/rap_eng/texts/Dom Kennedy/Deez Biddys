I'ma creep, I'ma dog
Fuggin' your bitch, she lemme hit it raw
Got it on tape, would never show it off
Panaramic take, so you could see it all

1st verse
I display 'em all, then never call 'em back
I don't need 'em all, but never take it back
Make that bitch lick my balls, while I roll another bag
Then hop up out the car, tell that bitch to take a cab
I be on that mota r-rollin' coma f-far from sober
Bonita rosa she roll it up legal California
Los scandalous I be rappin' this when I put it on ya
West Coast got bestest in bitch brew in the cloudy doja
Yaaa, pop it while you handstand
Yaaa, drop it like you can't stand
Like you on band stand
Quit talkin' all that I don't need a man
You the type of bitch that be my biggest fan

My bitch, a bad piece
Your bitch, got bad teeth
My bitch, roll mad weed
Your bitch, got bad feet muddafugga they, stink
