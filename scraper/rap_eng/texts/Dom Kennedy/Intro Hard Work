[Verse 1]
I used to sell clothes, now I sell dope
They ask me can I rap for free and I just yell no!
I'm trying to get paid, take it up the block
Inglish got the bass, I told him make it while it's hot
Take the whole thing, break it down to rocks
You don't need a bag let it stay up in your socks
White socks fitted, I'm chilling on top
A rookie in the game but I'm feeling like I'm not
Life after death, feeling like I'm shot
I'm bout to go dimin' from what's chilling in the pot
Who need a hit? I got slick words
This is not a movie but you can get served
Don't want to be no star but I got big dreams
Some niggas got jobs, but I got sixteens
Trying to go legit, don't want to break laws
I guess they was right, hard work be paying off
And I tell 'em like

[Hook]
95 Air Max cause I'm a dope runner
Balling like an athlete but got no jumper

95 Air Max cause I'm a dope runner
Balling like an athlete but got no jumper

[Verse 2]
Umbrellas up, my reign has begun
Amongst all the legends, my name has become
Shine so hard, playing in the sun
My mind playing tricks is what we played when we was young
Shoot the hot five is what when played when we was done
When you snapped your fingers niggas say where they was from
Cars pulling up, say where they was from
Hopping out active homie take away your lunch
Take away your dinner, take away your brunch
Sizing up your chin so they can take away your fronts
You was in the back, I was in the front
Hit the polo racks, my niggas buy up what we want
Get a nice fade, line up in the front
If I'm in the club, there's a line up in the front
Cocoanut juice, the lime up in the blunt
In 2008 I pushed the rhymes up out the trunk
I worked hard

[Hook X2]
