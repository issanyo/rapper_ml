[Verse 1: Dom Kennedy]
They say, They say, They say
They say AH you be killin it, Dog is you feelin it?
Stupid dope lines nigga, Dom is you dealin it?
This my rough draft nigga live on that dealer shit
Guess what I'm gone drive when I drive off the dealership
Red leather seats, black trim on some Thriller shit
Boppin like a Boss Rick Ross on my Killin shit (3x)
I don't really like you, you just gotta deal with it
I can press the line though, you just gotta chill with it
Everybody got they own lane till I'm stealin it
And everybody got they own chain till I'm stealin it
The way I spit gold nigga you could say I'm grillin it
Fresh like the prince bitch, you could say I'm Willin it
Buyin all expensive shit, you can say I'm Hillin it
Throwin niggas out the house you can say I'm Philin it
Getting head in bathrooms, you can say I'm illin it
And You could say I'm feelin it
You could say I'm killin it

[Hook]

They say AH you be killin it, dog is you feelin it?
Stupid dope lines nigga, Dom is you dealin it?
Leimert Park nigga on my mom we be killin it
B-S-O-D on my mom we be spillin it
If murder was the case I'm like naw bitch I'm innocent
Gangsta LA on arm lookin ignorant (3x)

[Verse 2: Dom Kennedy]

It ain't even ready yet, you could say we mixin it
Baby ain't my girlfriend but you could say we kickin it
Spit that motivational, I just don't be preachin it
I know how to add fool, I just don't be teachin it
See me in some foreign shit, I just won't be leasin it
My Dickies lookin good too, I just don't be creasin it
Dom in other cities now, bitches want a piece of it
Don't be chasin waterfalls, I just hope she Creepin it
Gettin like 25 to life for concealin it
And you could say I'm feelin it
You could say I'm killin it

[Verse 3: Skotch Davis]

Ay Yo, I'mma let these niggas know, I ain't for the dumb shit
Daddy name Vince but, I ain't on that young shit
Ladies love to kick it cause we be on that fun shit
Keep a pair of air max yea I'm tryin to run shit
Talk about flavor uh, you could say I'm margarine
Black and Silver Whips, yea you could say we Raided it
Yea we did a song together you just said they hated it
But they ain't got no choice cause the DJ keep on playin it
Rollin with a Kennedy got life lookin differently
Linkin with the homie got the West Side feelin me
Shuttin down stadiums, you could say we Sheain shit
If you ain't familiar then you could say we Yankee shit
Champion at 26 yea I'm on my Yankee shit
When you out of time yea you could say I'm spankin it
You could call me Benjamin, I'm just bein Frank with it
I'mma put her ass to bed, you just here to blanket it
