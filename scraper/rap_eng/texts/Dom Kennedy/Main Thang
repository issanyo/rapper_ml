[Intro: Dom Kennedy]
Custom made for the baddest in the club
Pockets full of hundreds, no dubs
My old girl still gotta grudge
I'm slidin’ with my main thang

[Chorus:Eric Bellinger & Dom Kennedy]
I just left the club and I'm tipsy so be on your way
I already know that you miss me (I know)  so you might as well stay (stay, stay, stay, stay)
3AM, it's a party in my hotel (yeah)
Baby, just me and you in my hotel (yeah)
Music on loud while we go up in my hotel
Come do the things that I like and I won't tell

[Verse 1: Eric Bellinger]
I can't control myself, tell me can you blame me?
I need you and no one else, swing through, baby
I used to break you off, watch you take it off
Can you take it all? She gon' take it all
She love to make it clap, round of applause
So she don't wanna go, that's a Eazy Call
And I know that we shouldn’t be involved (No)
But this Henney got me thinkin' of my odds

[Chorus: Eric Bellinger]
I just left the club and I'm tipsy so be on your way (yeah)
I already know that you miss me (I know) so you might as well stay (stay stay stay stay)
3AM, it's a party in my hotel (iyeah)
Baby, just me and you in my hotel (yeah)
Music on loud while we go up in my hotel
Come do the things that I like and I won't tell

[Verse 2: Eric Bellinger]
They call me E-R-I-C beezy, alter ego Eazy (Eazy)
Told them I'd be on top but they didn't believe me
Ah, I'm still sittin' pretty like a finger roll
Ah, gold rims shinin' on my Beamer though
Nothing but real niggas in my section, though, huh (yeah)
No help, I’m my own investor bro
Gold pieces all in my collection though (bling)
Bet not walk in my direction though
Perfect ten by my side
I'ma need you to drive, windows tinted on my ride
They can't see us inside, no

[Chorus: Don Kennedy & Eric Bellinger]
I just left the club and I'm tipsy so be on your way
I already know that you miss me (I know)  so you might as well stay (stay stay stay stay)
3AM, it's a party in my hotel (yeah)
Baby, just me and you in my hotel (yeah)
Music on loud while we go up in my hotel
Come do the things that I like and I won't tell

[Outro: Don Kennedy & Eric Bellinger]
Custom made for the baddest in the club
Pockets full of hundreds no dubs (la la la la, la la la la)
My old girl still gotta grudge
I'm slidin’ with my main thang (la la la la, la la la la)
I'm the one that you should run to
You could even have my son, too
It feel like I know you so well
We should light a couple more Ls
That’s a Eazy Call
Head back to my room, that's a Eazy Call
That's a Eazy Call
Me on top of you, that's a Eazy Call
Stare through my window, so eazy, so eazy, so eazy
It's so eazy, so eazy, so eazy
