[Intro]
Ay
Shoutout to the OG that made this possible
This is gonna be one of my smoothest joints ever

She love to hear to me rap, I rub her ass then switch positions
Rowdy dawgs all day I’m off the leash don’t need a kennel
I made this joint so you could dance when you naked you special uh

Sip wine with a baddie who wanted me badly and call that fuego
That’s fuego

We call that fuego
Sip wine with a baddie who wanted me badly
We call that fuego

[Verse 1]
Dussy taste like mango
Good girl got her angles
Thank the lord I’m grateful
Money came Im thankful
Smash that ass on tables
Sometimes she wants labels
Most times she just want me
I like it she bossy
Dont know anybody that cross me
Pull up to her pad and I’m saucy
The jersey Im rocking right now
She wanna wear that
All of my guys got money
We square that
All my jawns been fire
I swear that
Come girl like play that
I want you like a maybach
You want songs I can make that
I want love she can make that
That’s fuego
That’s fuego
Too fuego
