[Verse 1]
I'm on point
That's not the 300 its the Rolls Royce
Stainless steel watch by choice with the gold voice
One look at me and she moist, we in Fuego
Hard rock suite down in Day-go get her prego
Wake up real early to Eggos, and fresh squeezed
You can wear Adidas and Gucci it mesh clean
And I'll take any color in the coupe except green
The girls that I used to fuck with is ex fiends
Thinking I should spend my money on you thats extreme
Now if time cost money, and money cost time
Take care of wifey keep them honeys on the side
Real playboys keep a bunny on the side
Cause you gon' need somebody to bail you out
Platinum Chanel - I can lobster tail you out
Stay in the house cause bitch I can tell you wild
These niggas thirsty, you know they can smell you out
I'mma mack, don't let these niggas Dell you out
Stay focused - if you could get a lil' closer
I'll take you with me when it's time to go on Oprah
Gumbo just ain't the same without okra
And you don't look good without me it's the same thing
Remember Kobe cheated on his, the same ring
We getting rich off sixteens and can't sing
I got fans know who I am in Beijing
I bought my first car off the lot at eighteen
I knew niggas going to jail when we was twelve
They used to come back to school like it was hell
I got my style back in them days if you can tell
Things didn't always look bright but we prevailed
We used to roll oregano joints that we would sell
If you got a couple of sales that's clientele
Ain't no one way in it's try and fail
The games has it's ups and downs you buy and sell
I might go back to school I might Yale
Get a couple million next year I might as well

[Hook]
Uh, Yeah
Platinum Chanel (this that)
Platinum Chanel (this that)
Platinum Chanel (this that)
Platinum Chanel

[Verse 2]
I keep going
Diamonds on diamonds and shit, it keeps snowing
Err'body say they want peace 'til the piece showing
Pull it out the 501's with the crease showing
Take a couple shots then I'm done B. Bowens
I'm the biggest star on the field like T. Owens
Damn I only met her last week and she on it
I ain't got much time to give but she want it
If Mercedes make a new Benz then we want it
Take yo' moment and make it our moment
We don't ask for nothin' from our opponent
We dont give a fuck, my gold chain's stolen
Yo' gold chain plated, ya whole style dated
Leimert Park Legend, So Cal greatest
House party going Fo' Cal Bangaz, shit gets dangerous
First get money, nigga then get famous
Now fuck being famous, the whole shit tainted
You got no money, 10 G's a month yeah I know God love me
I laugh on my way to the bank the shit funny
Don't wear LeBrons to the club the shit's ugly
3 Piece rims on the Porsche it look lovely
Chain hang down to my tummy I look chubby
Tell her like Kendrick Lamar just don't wuwwy
I'm in the best shape of my youth I'm getting loot
I'm backstage eating on fruit, you drinkin' soup
Ya single didn't even recruit you out the loop
It's me, Cube, Quick, and Snoop it's not a fluke
Sittin' out front of the stoop I got the juice
Before I leave the house tonight, I got you ma
