New OPM Shit

New New OPM shit

[Verse: Jason Madison]
I said my favorite movie Friday, I still smoke swishers
I'ma do it my way, you hating on niggas
U still bitin Kanye and Drake whole image
I worked on The Dropout, Then I brought Dom out
Know who I'm talking bout?
*DOM* I think I know who you talkin bout
Fuck name droppin, y'all just game watching
I'm Marc Jacobs watches, Wit hella bass knockin
Put it in ya face, uhh tell 'em Jase got it
Now I got these bitches out in every state rocking
Tell em who the man is, it's not a Problem
Shout out to Diamond Lane, I got fam in every gang
I'm the man in every way, Put Mo' Grams in everything
My program is errythang
Fuck Bitches, Love Life
Get Money, Get Right
Give More, Good Advice
Try to learn something real from my OG's
I was out in the field and this is what they told me

[Hook: Jason Madison]
I'm the mu'a'fuckin mu'a'fuckin M-V-P
When they hollerin my name, Tell em you know me
When you see me in the streets say what up to a G
When you see me in the streets nigga holla at me (4x)

[Verse 2: Jason Madison]
Game Recognize Game
Ain't a damn thing changed on my campaign
Only saying would you like more champagne
I'm only paying if they got more bitches coming
I'm just sayin we the only real niggas coming
Marathon, we the only real niggas running
In H-Town having Dreams, trill niggas done it
But Most niggas say they real, but they really frontin
That's why I chill, Tryna build with my little brother
We the 9th Wonders, Life under the stars
Ain't what its hyped up to
So I stack up my yards, and then I drop buckets
Most Valuable Player, but if I'm not fuck it!
Stil come off the bench and I could drop 20
Every bitch that I'm wit, she got a lotta money
I like to listen to this, when its hot and sunny
Maybe in the nighttime checkin out the skyline

[Hook: Jason Madison]
The mu'a'fuckin mu'a'fuckin M-V-P
When they hollerin my name, Tell em you know me
When you see me in the streets say what up to a G
When you see me in the streets nigga holla at me

I'm The mu'a'fuckin mu'a'fuckin M-V-P
When they hollerin my name, Tell em you know me
When you see me in the streets say what up to a G
When you see me in the streets nigga holla at me (3x)

[Verse 3: DOM Kennedy]
Mary J Blige , Love No Limit
Back in Junior High I was Po Po Pimpin
Now I'm Do or Die and I'm mo Moe sippin
Told her 5 years ago but you hoes don't listen
See me on the Ave., Gold gold drippin
Dreams came true, It's no more wishin
Some queens came thru, to handle they business
And everyday now feel just like Christmas
I'm on mu'a'fuckin mu'a'fuckin BET
After that I switch the Laker game on T-N-T
Nigga pockets gettin swole like the G-N-C
And they say we on the road like the D-M-V
All my niggas run the city like D-M-C
Doing fuckin interviews wit the T-M-Z
Two people that I trust most Me and ME
And that's how they make niggas in the 323
I'm the mu'a'fuckin mu'a'fuckin M-V-P
West OPM til the E-N-D
You'll never catch me in no D & G
I'm a swapmeet nigga, fitted hat and a T
