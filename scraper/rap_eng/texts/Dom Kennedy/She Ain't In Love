[Verse 1]
Trying to reach the Lords favor
I ain't got no haters
I live in the sky scraper
I ain't got no neighbors
Man I got so many styles
Call it poppin labels
It's two girls on they knees playing hot potatoes (Ha)
I love to see her shake tell her break somethin
I get 50 g's a month, nigga make somethin (Wah!?)
You nigga goin broke like the government
I just wanna smoke while I fuck a bitch
I see you went pop on some sucker shit
I want 5 g's a show or I ain't fuck with it

[Pre Hook]
It's a hunned grand a waup
Bitch you be strugglin'
When I'm on the block they be loving me
Word to 2pac it's the thug in me
When I'm out to shop bitches huggin me
Girls all on my jock, she in love with me
I tell her stop, you ain't in love with me

[Hook]
She just like my watch, she ain't in love with me
She just wanna shop, she ain't in love with me
She just like my drop, she ain't in love with me
See me loose my top, she ain't in love with me
She know I make a knot, she ain't in love with me
She just like the shit I rock, she ain't in love with me
She know I'm headin' for the top, she ain't in love with me
I'm just so motherfuckin' hot, she ain't in love with me

[Verse 2]
My name be holding weight, bitch you still a fake
You could get this drank, but you still a skank (Ho)
Hear me on my tank, thats what killa drank
You in the 08 but you got dealer plates
I made her put her face in her pillow case
Shootin' for the money, I'mma kill the bank
I'm eatin all steak till I'm Phillip Banks
Cancelin y'all niggas like Will and Grace
We trying to get them cars that the dealers can't
I'm in the UK with a million Franks

[Pre Hook + Hook]

[Outro]
Yeah yeah yeah
She ain't in love with me
She ain't in love with me
She ain't in love with me
She ain't in love with me
