[Chorus: Quentin Miller]
Fuck that shit we in the hills
Y'all ain't getting to it for real, man
Y'all don't really do it for real, man
Quentin Miller, Half-A-Mil, man

[Refrain: Quentin Miller]
Fuck these guys on?
Fuck is really going on, man?
I had a check before I went inside, but when I looked that shit was gone man

[Verse 1: Dom Kennedy]
That shit was gone
And you'll going out Coldplay
My wrist be off snowflake
75, partly cloudy, bitch you coming?
Poolside, pouring up the 18 hundred
Fuck these guys on man?
I prefer to get mines the long way
'96 Chris with the entree
Two a day, it's a double
No bodyguards, I don't need the muscle
Fucked the first night, we don't judge you
She gon' get attached if I cut her
I'ma smoke the whole thing and use all three rubbers

[Chorus: Quentin Miller]
Fuck that shit we in the hills
Y'all ain't getting to it for real, man
Y'all don't really do it for real, man
Quentin Miller, Half-A-Mil, man

[Verse 2: Hit-Boy]
Yeah, yeah, yeah
HS87 that's my clique, damn
Tapped in with Dom K., we the new Jim and Cam
Yeah I'm going to 60 seconds in that foreign man
I be hearing all your shit and it be boring man
Bust down Rollie, I just threw that on my wrist
Party in the hills and you didn't make the list
Quentin off that Henny, Dom off the crisp
BC in the grotto with a hundred chicks
Tell the DJ run that "100 Rounds"
Delivery on the way up, he brought a hundred pounds
Blade on me, circle smaller
Yeah, I had to cut the clowns
I'ma hit the gate clicker, let me know when you touching down

[Hook: Quentin Miller]
Fuck that shit we in the hills
Y'all ain't getting to it for real, man
Y'all don't really do it for real, man
Quentin Miller, Half-A-Mil, man

[Refrain: Quentin Miller]
Fuck these guys on?
Fuck is really going on, man?
I had a check before I went inside, but when I looked that shit was gone man
