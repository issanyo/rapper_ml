[Verse:]
My shit my shit
I’m no Usher
Damn girl, you really remind me
On these Westside streets is where you can find me
The helicopter lights almost blind me
In the Mercedes Benz that I wanted since the 90s
Look I’m the one all the hoes wanna sit with
I can take a punch in the endos lick
This is not a remix
See who I’m gonna leave with
The homie Ricky Hill is from Limos trick
I like pussy since the day I came out one
Everybody wanna know where I got the bounce from
Throw the dollar bills in the sky they don’t count none
If you’re gonna say it that loud be about something
Otherwise keep it down
I’m a keep it real I was a DC child
Saw all this bullshit y’all been speaking now
Make it easy when she see me around
I got no sneak business
No weak mistress
No he didn’t it’s all like that
I asked her why she wrote her name in my phone like that
With emoji fucks with Jerry over stogie
East Lansing Michigan I first saw it snowing
That was four years ago
Damn we’ve just been going on the sprint
Tour bus, car truck or the Boeing
Baby you’re gonna make me pull my groin fall back
I gotta get to Boston
On the bus coughing
Let me get the mic man I feel alright
N*ggas got stuff and they still alright
And the lastest just cold Bs and Cs
That’s why these rappers get hit up for fees
The shit you say is real hard to believe
But me I’m decades in this
Write essays endless
Might end up friendless
For all this money knock off the hinges
We in the trenches y’all on them benches
Ain’t got my distance the drinks we mixing
When she come over there’s no resistance
We watch the Dodger game pronto
You deserve a penthouse condo
Mongos assorted fresh fruits
Two gold hoops six inch boots
Twelve dollar suits
I’m not into suits
I’m here for the loot
No time to regroup
We fixing to shoot
And put up 50 shots on y’all nightly
Even if BET don’t invite me I’m the best
Gotta love it
We don’t even got a budget
Let me know how it was
Yeah right
Wanna go with me (yeah right)
Everybody wants to watch me fall
Can we have one large popcorn
Cherry Icee
A pack of Twizzlers
And a cup of ice please yeah
The OPM company now presents
Best After Bobby Two starring
The original Dom Kennedy and your LA Leakers
Please no cell phones or talking during the show
Till it’s over
