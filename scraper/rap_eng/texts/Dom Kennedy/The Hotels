[Verse 1: DOM KENNEDY]
I like her faster than Carreras
Twistin' all her hair up
Cartier is with me girl tell your friend to pair up
I'm gon' let this bed out
Help me lift this chair up
You gon' get me kicked out
Baby girl I dare us
Soon as I see your underwear it get tared up
Cuz I could beat it harder than these drums and wouldn't care much (yeah)
Then toss you like some red dunks
Cuz you a diamond like the brand I only wear once
And I be rhymin like the man you gon commit to
But I just wanna be the nigga you rub your shit to
You work out with
You get fit to
I ain't chasin nothin
I get everything I meant to
She make me feel like everything I been through
To post up
I flew coach but
Let's roll sum'n
You smoke huh
The life's good

Cheers to hotels all over
And girls that pick you up from airports when you told 'em
Navy blue fairfax
Duffle on my shoulder
And when I hit Atlanta we gon have to do it over
We say -- Cheers to hotels all over x3
And when I'm in Miami we gon have to do it over
We say -- Cheers to hotels all over x3 (Carter)

(Verse 2 - Carter)
I gotta get it gotta get it
Nah Dom bro
Tell ol girl I'm good on her
Matter fact ask her if she got some good on her
I'm tryna score an 8th
After that
She can skate
I got a girl and I love her
Make no mistake
I ain't perfect but the flow close
And they got me flyin coast to coast
See I depart in LAX arrive in HTX
Check in at the deck
Then hit Rodgers on the text (wassup)
Hit the lobby with a swag they ain't Neva seen
Concier showin love
Now I got the plug
When we come to your city you ain't gotta mug
These broads rushing to the front
You know they here for us
After the show
I'm prolly a no show
I'll be on my phone cakein
My niggas hatin
Check out at 8
Plus I got a early flight
Get it poppin on the skype
Then I call it a night
Watch who you give ya pipe
Gotta learn Where You Get It From
They say they won't tell
Man these birds liars
I'm just in a room
Smokin' by myself
That's enough of y'all hoes
And we say
Cheers to hotels all over
And homies who scoop you up from airports when you told 'em
Tall black, fairfax, duffle on my shoulder
And when we in your city
We gon have to do it over
And we say x10
Dom call the Rodgers
Who you know though
(Who you know x3)
