[Intro]
There's something you should know

[Dom talks]
Yeah, It's intermission time again
I'm about 2 bottles of Merlot in
I go by a couple names
My mom calls me Dom
And I know you been waitin
Wonderin when we was comin back
Cause I know it gets lonely when Im not around
But we had to perfect the sound
Tell Em

[L4 Talks]
Yeah, Your now tuned into the smooth sounds of
The Los Angeles Unified Sound District
Comin to you from, the West with Love
My name is Lazy Lou and Im a Sagittarius
Can ya dig it?

[Hook]
There's something you should know
Before we go and play
That baby tonite

So GO... Now
You should go girl

[All Dom says is "You should go girl. You should go."]
