[Verse 1: DOM KENNEDY]

On the daily you know what I wear
Chanel Platinum's all that I hear
Say you ball; I'm a just share
Lock you down girl, I'm a do years
Pretty girl with the long hair
Where you been, what’s over there?
Ugly girls stop and they stare
Its too bad, life it ain't fair
Drop it low like you don’t care
What you got on, I like ya Nike airs
Buy me some I like a nice pair
Before 21 I could buy beer
Stayed down all of these years
I’m not home you calling me there
Headed to the top follow me there
Met her at her spot she swallowed me there
We the new clique tell all to beware
Niggas look hard I oughta be scared
You niggas look fraud I solemnly swear
To never be a lame shit all of me is player
All this game and all of these prayers
Keeps me away from all you squares
Thick, ass like you do stairs
Well done but I can do rare

[Hook x2]
Pretty girl with the long hair (x8)

[Verse 2 Niko G4]

Pretty girl, long ass hair
Big ol ass, I fucked her bare
Off a pill like nigga who cares?
All my diamonds clear and rare
She coming, fucking, sucking, running
Loving the whole team
All my bitches sexy, ass thick with tongue rings
Spending all these stacks, tell her bring that pussy back
Have you loving young niggas, tell yo friends where it’s at
Bitch I been on the map, bitch you been on my sack
Now you getting extra thirsty cuz you heard a nigga rap
Boy G4, brand new kicks, all them Prada yea it cost 6
Wore em last week when I fucked yo bitch
‘Sace frames gold rings and shit
Roll with the winners, OpM the clique

[Verse 3: DOM KENNEDY]

OpM the clique, like a nigga came early
Know we in this bitch
Take it out put it back in
That’s not water baby that’s gin
That’s not soda baby that’s hen
What we gone eat? You gave me that $10
You looking good in that baby ass Benz
Windows down baby ass rims
Baby tee, baby hair, baby shorts, baby ass timbs
I don’t fuck with shady ass friends
Your nigga fake, maybe ask him
Met up, she gave me that trim
See me out, like “Baby that’s him”
My favorite drink is Grey Goose Pear
Give it to me in this chair
Anytime, anywhere pretty girl with the long hair
