Lets get this cash
Lets get this cash
Lets get this cash

[Verse 1]
What's up what's up what's up what's up with you niggas
Oh y'all stunting
You got thirty houses, why y'all fronting?
Quit playing I ain't impressed by small numbers
Talk chunkier, ever seen the 911 parked all up on the curb?
Just left my grandmomma house, we used to hit that [?]
Don't make me smoke this whole bag till it's emptied out
King of the south, when he went to jail
I said damn they just love to see a nigga fail
Imma keep it facts, I don't fuck with rap
Shit is only temporary like you fix a flat
And I'm a real player, like a Thunderbird
I just go up in value, let me do my turn
Please let the money burn, never kiss and tell
I don't got time for it baby, not if it smell
I like mine well done, make it clap
Please look me in my eyes when you fuck me back
Karl Malone with the mail, right on time huh
Just want everything to sound like vagina
This a business call, you can get the axe
Same nigga everyday, just a different track
Yeah
Yeah
Bout my business, uh

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
I been coppin bands, like I'm flipping packs
I whisper in her ear, gimme that can't leave it up to chance
Ready for my first pitch, putting something in the music that can make the Earth skip
Rockin Vans, off white man you know it
Got some friends coming through hoping that she don't blow it
Bitch you had your time, now we quick to smash
She wear that little pink skirt just to get me mad
I don't like to brag, I been through some real shit
Back when MTV was playing videos with Will Smith
When she lived in a different neighborhood I still went
Her mom kicked me out on the street when she got home
Im bout it
Im bout it
You can ask that nigga BD he can vouch for us

[Hook]

[Outro]
New beat, new flow
New spots, new rose
Gotta get this cash
Gotta get this cash

New beats, new -
New spots, new-
Gotta get this cash
Cash

4 in the morning and I'm still up
Cash
Cash
Cash
