[Intro: Ty Dolla $ign]
Oh oh oh

[Verse 1: Dom Kennedy]
The girls all cling to me
After she took a shower I let her wear my Supreme hoodie
I'm fully paid, got a young face when I'm fully shaved (oh, oh, oh)
I like Griffey, my dad favorite would be Willie Mays
You get in the game be true to it
They say that I got a lot of hoes but I was used to it
Thinking 'bout her body and what I would do to it (oh, oh, oh)
Looking at the stars, getting head, I call that moonroof
She said "I can't fuck with you Dom cause you too stupid" (oh, oh, oh)
Used to love Death Row and I used to love Ruthless
Talking 'bout the Westside, right there on Crenshaw (oh, oh, oh)
Back in '93 everybody was from Lench Mob
Girls ain't groupies, most these niggas are (oh, oh, oh)
Stop buying Jordans, save up, you should get a car
Buy you a laptop, buy you a saxophone (oh, oh, oh)
I got a clean bed, me and you can get nasty on
She love it when I talk dirty
It's only 3:30 (oh, oh, oh)
I know you at work but can you come home early?
Just me and my bitch (oh, oh, oh)
And all she wanna do is hear me say some fly shit

[Hook: Ty Dolla $ign]
Like all the places, we can go
All the things, we can do
When it's just, me and you
We ain't worried 'bout tomorrow
Oh, oh, oh
We ain't worried 'bout tomorrow
Oh, oh, oh

[Verse 2: Dom Kennedy]
And life's a bitch so I had to pimp it
I went from water with a lemon straight to lavish livin'
Fashion's trend: exchange numbers with the baddest women
I couldn't wear a suit and tie and get a average pension
Cause niggas like me would always have detention (oh, oh, oh)
But niggas like me always had ambitions
Of being free in this cold world (oh, oh, oh)
It's just a couple real niggas left and my homegirls
It's real shit right there (oh, oh, oh)
Watch my old videos, I still sit right there
Ran with my clique right there (oh, oh, oh)
First fist fight, I bust my lip right there
I'm just yo' chick type, yeah (oh, oh, oh)
She probably nod her head like "This my shit right here"
Now, I got my game from the Dogg Pound (oh, oh, oh)
So if she know me, then I probably took them draws down
I got 4 cars now (oh, oh, oh)
I took the 6-4 cause she like they way the car sound
Just me and my bitch (oh, oh, oh)
And all she wanna do is hear me say some fly shit

[Hook: Ty Dolla $ign]
Like all the places, we can go
All the things, we can do
When it's just, me and you
We ain't worried 'bout tomorrow
Oh, oh, oh
We ain't worried 'bout tomorrow
Oh, oh, oh

Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
