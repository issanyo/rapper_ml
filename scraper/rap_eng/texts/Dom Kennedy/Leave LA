[Intro: Ty Dolla $ign]
Sunset, yeah, sundress, yeah
I see how you bombin', yeah
You know I want it, yeah
Gave it to me, huh, yeah, we made a movie, huh
Big ol' booty, yeah, bring a friend for 20, yeah
Went from LD, uh, to the crazy girl
She just move a Hollywood, she look just like Megan Good, yeah
Took her to the mansion, she don't wanna leave now
Ooh, whoa, whoa

[Verse 1: 24hrs]
Switched it up, just tired of the same old
You get off work, pick you up in that Durango
Pussy good and it taste like mango
So wet, think that I just saw a rainbow
Pop a dose, my lil' shawty want the lobster roll
She throw it back, tryna made me have a heart attack
My new flame, she work at the Blue Flame
Valet park at Lennox, we go shop at Fendi
Fly out, touchdown
I live in the Valley
Right cheek, left cheek
Shawty pop them mollies

[Chorus: 24hrs, Ty Dolla $ign, & Dom Kennedy]
Don't play, now she never wanna leave LA
She don't ever wanna leave LA
She don't ever wanna leave LA (Whoa)
She don't ever wanna leave LA
She don't ever wanna leave (Whoa)
(She don't!)
She don't ever wanna leave LA

[Verse 2: Dom Kennedy]
I'm the one that she keep callin' daddy
Type in Lamar Park on the navi'
Booty soft, baby, let me get a grip
500 dollar chips, encore fully dressed
Flooded piece on my neck, and got your piece on my neck
I'll throw two Gs and I'll throw three mo'
If you dance for my nigga right here, y'all both
She from the South and went to Hampton, yes
I got her naked in some candids, yes
It went up soon as we landed
Parachute time, never do we slip
It's in a German automobile and champagne kiss

[Chorus: 24hrs, Ty Dolla $ign, & Dom Kennedy]
Don't play, now she never wanna leave LA (Whoa)
She don't ever wanna leave LA (LA)
She don't ever wanna leave LA (LA) (Whoa)
She don't ever wanna leave LA
She don't ever wanna leave (Whoa)
(She don't!)
She don't ever wanna leave LA
(Whoa)
