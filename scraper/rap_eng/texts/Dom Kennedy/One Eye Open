[Intro: VanJess]
You can't relate
[?]

[Verse 1]
You gotta know how much you gettin per album to be militant
I could write it for you, you still couldn't deliver it
You get more than a black card for your membership
Paying taxes, holding guns, big benefits
Another pair of Acne jeans, ooh I'm killin sh*t
Got nothin' to lose, got nothin to lose
I'm from the side of L.A. that feel like Beirut
Josh Gibson flow, the black Babe Ruth
Inventory climbing, plane now arriving
She got my double single ready, and my have to have
Wrist on freeze, just left Denver
She wanna be with me cause she know I'm widdit
Caught another metronome off the backboard
I was already known, fuck I rap for?
Cussin at the cop when he harass me
I don't wanna stop if she nasty
Grab her by the weave but you can't hit her
Felt like yesterday we played tag, pick up
I've been down so long, I'ma uplift em
And get the yellow Turbo and do a buck sixty

I tried to tell you niggas don't fuck with me
One eye open
Yea, aye

[Hook: VanJess]
*Harmonizing*

[Verse 2]
Look, don't take these rappers so serious
That's just real shit, period
I kick real shit, period
The way you carry yourself got me so curious
I wonder who pickin you up
And who take them pictures at brunch?
Who buying you all them fits?
Do you let down that fence?
Opulence is exactly what we strive for
But our women are the gifts we should die for
Why deprive yourself of the five course?
I buy all the twelves, I don't try on
You know the Westside gon get the vibe goin
This could be a novel by Donald Goines
I don't put my trust into any coins
The OPM party if you tryna join
Feel that?
You feel that?
Yea

[Outro]
Yea I like how you
Goin crazy
Got the *censored* goin crazy
Got the *censored* goin crazy
Got the *censored* goin crazy
Got the *censored* goin crazy
