Special shout-out to the whole, whole, whole West side 6,7,8,9 It go...
We used to run streets now they just ours
My luck has been good we made it this far
You probly went to class, we skipped ours
And when we never came home baby we sent flowers
It's grind time, missed showers
Had my iPod playing that 25th hour
I used to mess with red bull til they went sour
Had my lil heart charged up to the 5th power
If I could fly, I'd rather ride
Dead or suck? I'd rather die
I'm the new DMC with a leather eye
Strings in my adidas hang loose and they never tied
I could go all day I'm never tired
Hand on the bible, I have never lied
I had my back to the wall it happened several times
Few broken bones, cracked ribs and a severed spine

But Go Head
Go Head
Go Head
It go If we ain't runnin'
Yeah the world suck but hey we ain't done it when police start comin'
Go Head
Go Head

So when things are looking grim
You wanna see the light well baby just look at him
You be crazy to look at them
It's all smoke and mirrors so maybe just look again
But this time try not to see it with your eyes
See it with your soul, see it with your vibe
Never mind the earth never mind the fire
I was in it too but it was only online
I was thinking to myself they don't know me online
I'm famous where I live at the city hall making changes for the kids
No more danger at the crib
I'm notorious too had to change it after BIG
Then I went to see the movie had to sang it at the bridge
I'm a bad boy with no puffy
I'm on my cycle, no monthly
When I cruise in my city I do it so comfy
There's only one girl in this world that I know love me

But Go Head
Go Head
Go Head
It go If we ain't runnin'
Yeah the world suck but hey we ain't done it when police start comin'

I know I didn't always come home when you wanted me to Ma
But it's aight
It turned out aight
I'm still here

And tell em like If we ain't runnin
Yeah the world suck but hey we ain't done it when police start comin'
Go Head
Go Head

Sometimes you gotta stand up on your own...Thats what I had to do

It go If we ain't runnin
Yeah the world suck but hey we ain't done it when police start comin'
Go Head
Go Head

I just hope I make you smile

It go If we ain't runnin
Yeah the world suck but hey we ain't done it when police start comin'
Go Head
Go Head
