[Intro: Dom Kennedy]
Sidewalk, fast lane
Got a couple zig-zags, (?) ash tray
Crystal fancy, Ice Cream hand made

[Verse 1: Dom Kennedy]
I tell you what
You not gon' make it on the bus, if you not fuckin' one of us
Call her Roxi Blush, Pizza Hut to the crust
Don't do 'em like that, one hand on my nuts
Ay, dark shades on the bitch, hoodie on top down
Hear the waves when they twitch, roll joints back to back
We just wanna have fun, nothing wrong
This for the girls who wanna dance on the wall
Got somethin' coming, brand new, all pure
Tell 'em I spit like that, because I get like that
Try and buy the whole building, he ain't built like that
Shouldn't be a close call, even if I'm last minute, I'm the best candidate
No pun intended, let me run in it
Give you what's missing, then maybe we can fire it up

[Hook: Dom Kennedy]
I went from sittin' on the sidewalk, now I'm in the fast lane
Got a couple zig-zags, sittin' in my ashtray
Crystal fancy, Ice Cream hand made
Mostly pour champagne
Sittin' on the sidewalk, now I'm in the fast lane
Got a couple zig-zags, sittin' in my ashtray
Crystal fancy, Ice Cream hand made

[Verse 2: Ty Dolla $ign]
It's either Vans or Nike's
I got a whole lotta Supreme and Ice Cream
Pull up in the Porsche, now she like me
She just want a picture for her IG
No phones, trick
We just tryna live in the moment
(?) the winner, I own it
Yo, man, it's to good to control it
And gril, you need a man, that's gon' get you and your girls plane tickets
Come party with a rich nigga
You got your hair and your nails did
And you ain't got no kids
I'll fuck you right, I will
I'll fuck you right, I will
Then I roll one up, you been single two years
You been working hard, hell yeah, you deserve it all

[Hook: Dom Kennedy]
I went from sittin' on the sidewalk, now I'm in the fast lane
Got a couple zig-zags, sittin' in my ashtray
Crystal fancy, Ice Cream hand made
Mostly pour champagne
Sittin' on the sidewalk, now I'm in the fast lane
Got a couple zig-zags, sittin' in my ashtray
Crystal fancy, Ice Cream hand made

[Scratches]
Come party with a rich nigga
Don't do 'em like that, one hand on my nuts
We just tryna live in the moment

Come party with a rich nigga
Don't do 'em like that, one hand on my nuts
We just tryna live in the moment

[Hook: Dom Kennedy]
I went from sittin' on the sidewalk, now I'm in the fast lane
Got a couple zig-zags, sittin' in my ashtray
Crystal fancy, Ice Cream hand made
Mostly pour champagne
Sittin' on the sidewalk, now I'm in the fast lane
Got a couple zig-zags, sittin' in my ashtray
Crystal fancy, Ice Cream hand made
