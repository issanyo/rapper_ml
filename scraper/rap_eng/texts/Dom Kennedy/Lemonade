[Intro]
Can't make no real decision based on emotion
You especially can't make no money
And I'm here to get paid

[Verse 1]
Sit with my son in the shade, sippin' lemonade
If that's his favorite, I'll buy it
I mix mine with iced tea, I let him try it
If I told you I have fo' million in the bank, I'd be lyin'
If I told you I was broke, you wouldn't believe me, anyways
So it's a good thing I'm not, takin' pictures in the fox
I remember when we used to be in here eatin' Whoppers
Rollin' five homies deep, mall security would stop us
'What ya'll up to? Ay, ya'll ain't shoppin', ya'll ain't workin'
Ya'll just makin' people nervous with them backpacks
Size thirty-eighty jeans, and you got your hat back'
That's another trademark, we was on the fast track
In the midst of growin' up, memories from, like, threesome
Through all the ups and downs
I always felt we was gon' be somethin'
At eighteen months old, through a smile, I see teeth comin'
Now all he wanna drink is lemonade

[Hook]
Good thing it don't take much to make that
It's a good thing it don't take much to make that
Water, sugar, lemon, squeeze
Water, sugar, lemon, squeeze
Water, sugar, lemon, squeeze, water, sugar, lemon

Water, sugar, lemon, squeeze
Water, sugar, lemon, squeeze
Water, sugar, lemon, squeeze, water, sugar, lemon

[Verse 2]
Just another Friday in the studio
Truck ain't ready yet, just got the text from Julio
Rydell Chevrolet in Northridge, yes, I did
'Aren't you Dom Kenne--?' 'Yeah, yes, I is'
And I might have never blew the charts out
But girls still rock my T-shirt with they hearts out
Ay, and you know what I mean, player
250 a pop, them A.P.C. jeans, player
Uh, I be shoppin', I ain't frontin'
I could buy you what you wanted with my backpack
Let me get my notepad, a pencil, or a pen
Leave me in the studio
I guarantee when you come in I'll be finished
Cause I probably got a ticket fuckin' parkin'
Hate quiet neighborhoods, I'm used to hearin' dogs barkin'
Kids runnin', now formula is no longer the formula
Cause all he wanna drink is lemonade

[Hook]
