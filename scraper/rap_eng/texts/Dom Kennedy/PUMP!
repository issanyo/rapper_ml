[Verse 2: Ski Mask The Slump God]
My dick unimpressed
You take Xans that's pressed
My shirt striped like Ness
Flash them titties at me like the press
Speaking like I'm Hurricane Chris
Pull up on your momma I say "A Bay Bay"
Like I'm YMBAPE
I'm beating on my chest when I see the pussy if they ain't coming
Bitch off the rip
Just like a baby she just gon' take it from the tip
I just "Swiper, no swiping" that pussy 'cause I dip
Walked up in the division like "are you tryna pull?"
And there's no nigga that I fear
Got the horror of a spear
Got to be kidding me, made me giggle like tickle me
You said this nigga envy me
Bitch you shaped like a centipede
And my songs long as centuries
Bitch I must have to pull the .45 on my hip
I just got her cum on my dick
Arthritis wrist on sick
Cut my diamonds then get blisters
Blood diamond, ratchet ass bitch
She done sucked my dick and then you kissed her
You just might just throw a bitch fit
Bender with me cause the metal on my hip
Four-five bust like zit
Four-five bust like zit
Four-five bust like zit
Four-five bust like zit
Four-five bust like zit
Four-five bust like zit
Four-five bust like zit (Water)

[Verse 3: Lil Baby & XXXTENTACION]
Cartier glasses, I won't even peek at you
Yellow Ferrari like Pikachu
I got 'em waitin' and watchin' what he gon' do
Tryna peep what I do, tryna steal my moves
25 hundred for a new pair of tennis shoes
The same price, I could make them youngins come and finish you
Lawyer been chargin', he a Jewish like he voodoo
Real dope boy, hundred thousand in Evisu
Presidential tints slide by, we don't see you
I been gettin' money, I ain't worried 'bout what he do
I'm gettin' money like I'm from the '80s
Me and Drake 'bout to drop man, this shit gon' go crazy
They know I'm the truth, comin' straight from the basement
I'm straight as the street, man I come from the pavement
A million, all hundreds
Patty cake, patty cake
Work my wrist like patty cake
Two white bitches like Mary-Kate
Nigga want beef like patty cake, aye
Eat my dick like sirloin steak
Rape, bitch, that's my fetish, aye
I don't speak your language, Rosetta, hmm
Only speak the language of a lettuce, hey
Patty cake, patty cake
You finna get some dick today
Drop neck on me like a lynch, bitch, limp dick
Put it on your daughter and she still caught a nut

[Bridge: Dom Kennedy]
I’m just sitting 'round here smoking weed with my niggas

I’m just sitting 'round here smoking weed with my niggas
