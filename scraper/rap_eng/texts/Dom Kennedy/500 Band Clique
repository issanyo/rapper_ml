[Hook: Hit-Boy]
Knee deep in the game i ain't turnin back
Lost some homies that i thought would never turn they back

[Verse 1: Dom K]
Spend cash on cars probably shouldn't have
But you only die once ain't no coming back
And my landscape bills close to 30 g's
So the snakes in the grass don't worry me
Time to step on em
Threw the nike checks on em
Crenshaw mall, fatburger, you was hella nervous
Game get risky, your money get crispy
Mixing that don julio with the simply
HB

[Verse 2: Hit-Boy]
I only keep tabs on the currency
500 band clique, yeah i know you heard man
Big timing like we run with bird man
Rope chain on like i'm slanging birds man
Knee deep in it, i ain't turnin back
Half-a-mil set at the summer jam
James brown moves this the payback
Treatin' sunset boulevard like a racetrack
Dom slip through with a bottle, let the moe spill
So many coupes they think we doing dope deals
Mr. C hotel off beverwhil
If you don't get it now, then you never will

[Hook: Dom K]
Knee deep in the game never turning back
Lost some homies that i thought would never turn they back
Ran laps on the shaw, all the windows rolled down
Girls yell at the light, what you finna drop now

[Bridge: Dom K]
All cash on em', all cash
All cash on em', all cash
All cash on em', all cash

[Verse 3: Dom K]
An there really ain't nothin we could do here without it
Wearing shades at night like a stuntaman
Let me drop back, they gon' punt again
I done came up with a hundred trends
And i know this costa rican girl i wanna smuggle in
Import/export we be gettin checks more
And we sip moet more
Who needs an investor
It's always niggas with no game that wanna test yours
What you niggas crying to the refs for?

[Verse 4: Hit-Boy]
Way back no birds in the trap
And we doing numbers, skip algebra class
Only got love for my fam and my math
Only got love for my fam and my math
Respect to the squad in this hoe, we payed mad dues
An she love the fact i ain't got no tattoos
Guess again like we playin taboo
I'm not the nigga you should get attached to
Get dressed, ima see you not dressed, yeah
Got some good good for you, its some uber X fare
Real one, faded like a swap meet [?]
And you baggage overweight, bitch, carry on
Might do some lean, might do supreme
Bank teller, run it through the machine
2-10 traffic got em all askin
How an ashy nigga rise up from the ashes

[Hook: Hit-Boy]
Knee deep in the game i ain't turnin back
Lost some homies that i thought would never turn they back
Gotta stay sucka free in the streets boy
When you gettin money, stuntin like a d-boy

[Bridge: Dom K]
All cash on em', all cash
All cash on em', all cash
All cash on em', all cash

[Outro: Hit-Boy]
And it really ain't nothing but i still can't go without it
