[Intro: Hit-Boy]
Check out my next tale
Shit, we doin' more motivation over anything

[Verse 1: Hit-Boy]
Look, check out my next tale
Check out my next tale
Check out my next tale
When I had Nextel (brrt)
I used to chirp 'em in
I used to curve 'em in
I had some birds back then
'Fore I made "Niggas In Paris", I was puttin' shit together like Tetris
I had a bitch pregnant, imagine if she kept it
19, thuggin', 10s on my feet, we were stompin'
Right in the parking lot, fuck, I left Beemer runnin'
Now I got a V12 runnin', big smoke, DUI, fuck it
No, I'm not up-and-comin', I got a thing in the stash
They hatin' on Hit, but I'm here
You though I was just a producer
Now I'm in the booth, gettin' foolish
No Nike check, just do it

[Chorus: Hit-Boy]
Did it all for my doggs, yeah
I just did it all for my doggs, yeah
Did it all for my doggs, yeah
I just did it all for my doggs, yeah

[Verse 2: Dom Kennedy]
This gon' be a big movie, Lethal Weapon
Old-school costs more than a Lexus
Two of 'em, kissin' on me, feel like heaven
Fast split, yeah, real tits, yeah
Fresh Vans on my feet, girls on my stick
Told her I don't eat at Olive Garden, lil' bitch
Checkin' the iPhone, checkin' the iPhone
Stomach flat, yeah, ass fat, yeah
Don Julio shots, pineapple back, yeah
From the left side of the map
Where niggas cut her off, like [?] in traffic
Courtesy of Half-A-Mil, never fuck nothin' average

[Outro: Hit-Boy & Dom Kennedy]
Did it all for my doggs, yeah
I just did it all for my doggs, yeah (real shit, nigga)
Did it all for my doggs, yeah
I just did it all for my doggs, yeah
Courtesy of Half-A-Mil, yeah
Courtesy of Half-A-Mil, yeah
Did it all for my doggs, yeah
I just did it all for my doggs, yeah
Did it all for my doggs, yeah
I just did it all for my doggs...
