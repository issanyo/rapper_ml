[Chorus: Planet VI]
Uhhh uhhh
Got a pocket full of money (money)
That ain't shit (shit)
Got a couple cars (cars)
That ain't shit (shit)
Got a couple broads (broads)
That ain't shit (shit)
All I got is me and my niggas that’s it
Got a house on the hill (hill)
That ain't shit (shit)
Got dollar dollar bills (bills)
That ain't shit (shit)
Oh ya neck on chill (chill)
That ain't shit (shit)
All I got is me and my niggas that’s it (yes)

[Verse 1: Anything Ill]
Me and my niggas
Straight from off the block
A few years later
We made it off the block
Now we out in tortola
Chilling on a yacht
We live in hotels
I don’t even unpack
A young fly nigga
From my head to my toe
Treat my kicks like my homies
Take them everywhere I go
The same niggas here was with me when I was broke
Living life on the edge
Like we on death row
Haa haa we did it
Look how we living
Shoutout to all the freaks
But this for all my niggas
The ones that still here
And those who is no longer with us
Take a moment of silence
Pour out a little liquor
Me and benny d, kush, and ricky
Verse on the hook so all my niggas is with me
Me and my chick
Riding through the city
Listening to my shit
Either that or some biggie

[Chorus]
Got a pocket full of money (money)
That ain't shit (shit)
Got a couple cars (cars)
That ain't shit (shit)
Got a couple broads (broads)
That ain't shit (shit)
All I got is me and my niggas that’s it
Got a house on the hill (hill)
That ain't shit (shit)
Got dollar dollar bills (bills)
That ain't shit (shit)
Oh ya neck on chill (chill)
That ain't shit (shit)
All I got is me and my niggas that’s it

[Verse 2: Uptown A.P]
Me and my niggas
Me and my chick
Shoutgun bada may
Take the top off the whip
Me and my mama
Me and my pops
Me and my brother
Me and my block
I came from nothing
See that’s what am used to
So I ain't got a problem going back to what am used to
Blew through a million
In one year flat
With the help of my niggas
I got it all back
Family over money
Money over broads
In that exact order
What else do you want
Got life and my health
What else do I need
Besides niggas to be true
Niggas to be real
That industry bullshit will break niggas up
They snake in the grass
Dirty as fuck
So I ride for my niggas
Wrong or right ill die for my niggas
My niggas
Aight

[Chorus]
Got a pocket full of money (money)
That ain't shit (shit)
Got a couple cars (cars)
That ain't shit (shit)
Got a couple broads (broads)
That ain't shit (shit)
All I got is me and my niggas that’s it
Got a house on the hill (hill)
That ain't shit (shit)
Got dollar dollar bills (bills)
That ain't shit (shit)
Oh ya neck on chill (chill)
That ain't shit (shit)
All I got is me and my niggas that’s it

[Verse 3: Dom Kennedy]
Used to go hungry
Now we wanna eat
I used to want money
Now I want peace
Cause ain't nothing promised
When you running in the streets
Got my middle finger up
Right in front of the police
Some girls is freaks
Some girls you keep
Some cars you buy
Some cars you lease
Anything you want
Is right there within your reach
Yea there’s a lot to learn
Nigga even in defeat
I tell them wake up
Work hard
Then repeat
You either on the field
Or you watching in the seats
Me am in my cleats
Sacking through these beats
Living what I write
You got to practice what you preach
House on the hill
Home on the beach
It don’t mean shit
Its Just somewhere I can sleep
Without my niggas
It just wouldn’t be complete
And you ain't gotta wait for the 1st and 15th

[Chorus]
Got a pocket full of money (money)
That ain't shit (shit)
Got a couple cars (cars)
That ain't shit (shit)
Got a couple broads (broads)
That ain't shit (shit)
All I got is me and my niggas that’s it
Got a house on the hill (hill)
That ain't shit (shit)
Got dollar dollar bills (bills)
That ain't shit (shit)
Oh ya neck on chill (chill)
That ain't shit (shit)
All I got is me and my niggas that’s it (that’s it)
