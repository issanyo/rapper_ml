It Ain't Really Nothin'
[Hook]
All these bitches fuckin'
It ain't really nothin' (X2)
It ain't nothin
It ain't really nothin'. (X2)
I know you want me
?? To you

[Verse 1: Rich Hil]
Ricky Hil slide off in the Crown
Vic, Slickville, bitch it's goin' down
Bitches on my dick
Payin' 4 for the pound
Ricky talk slick
Homies get it outta town
Alpine like a mothafucka
Got a new jawn, fine as a mothafucka
What you talkin' bout bitch
I just walk 'em out
Chevy makes noise on the street when I walk it out
Uh, bitch I don't pay no mind to them
I be slurred out
That's the state of mind I'm in
And them bad bitches?
I got all kinds of them
She be leanin' on them pain pills & Heineken
CT, I mighta been
I'm prolly in the city though
With some short skirt, tall, big titty hoes
Lookin like they bout to shoot a fuckin video
Backwood with that lean
On my Philly flow

[Verse 2: Dom Kennedy]

I got my drink, I got my chronic
I know that bitch
She fuck w me, she f w rich, she f w bonic
You know me, I just be grindin'
Or I'm with my baby momma
All these other niggas suck
That's on my mom, just bein honest
I'm on this beat, you on my dick
You love my style, you stole my shit
Everywhere I go, they know my shit
And you ain't never really heard a song like this
You see my belt? I need your help
Just relax, be your self
Shit, get high, we won't melt
Don't bring yo friend if she won't help
Come kiss the sky, witness god
She wanna leave, but it's just too live
I'm in the heart, I'm in the thighs
Dot waste yo time, this bitch is mine
Rolie watch, Cuban chain, yo girlfriend in a groupie gang
Now I got my money up, my pockets feel like Gucci mane
West side? Believe it doe
My shit is arena doe
And I still be wearin' shit these niggas never seen before
My shit got gold buckets
Mom calls me Dom, I don't need no introduction
