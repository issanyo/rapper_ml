[Intro: Dom Kennedy:]
From the top
From the top
From the top
Uhh, yeah

I gotta stay fly in this bitch
Leopard print on my kicks
She just wanna swang with a nigga
HB, what it is
Give her all access
We in VIP, damn
In the [?] with the twins
[?] on the shrimps
Big ass diamonds, hella clear
These niggas [?] hella [?]
I guess I was supposed to be scared
My shit caught [?]
Even when I'm chillin' I be dressed fresh
My ashtray - Hermes
I'm a native nigga, you a pilgrim
She almost climax from the building

[Chorus: Dom Kennedy]
I gotta stay fly in this bitch
[?] print on my kicks
She just wanna swang with a nigga
HB, what it is

[Verse 2: Hit-Boy]
Ayy, shit, I'm at the crib
Can't get none of y'all niggas access
Things changed
I'ma need a sharp knife, look at the stakes
Blood on my collar, look at the stains
Walk through the fire, fire people are higher
Technician flow, a nigga had to rewire
This is unfriendly reminder
When I start to buss, I do not cease fire
Seeing shit, clear that I do not see prior
Left eye in the scope, no sniper
Do the most for niggas, still [?] to villain
Never brought a kid in this world, but I got children
Help niggas get out their momma crib, get out the jungles
Gotta keep blessing, I get it back double
I think we finna bubble, going for the win
Half-A-Mil, O.P.M, and you know I'm still reppin' HS87
Talk cake, no wedding
I ain't got no answers for your questions

[Chorus: Dom Kennedy]
I gotta stay fly in this bitch
[?] print on my kicks
She just wanna swang with a nigga
HB, what it is

[Bridge: Dom Kennedy]
Uhh
Stevie Wonder gon' fuck with this

[Outro: Sample]
- "See, I feel like it's time for us to, like, go out, go away from here, you know what I mean? I been thinking about it for a long time"
- "Where do we go?"
- "T, let's go to Africa"
- "Shit, nigga, please. Be for real"
- "Yo, I never been so serious in my life. I mean, we been to islands, we been everywhere. Who says we can't go to Africa?"
- "I mean... but, I mean... shhh, I mean, I don't know. Africa's far."
- "So what?! I'm sayin', just think about us. That's all we ever talk about, that's our dream, to go to our homeland. Where our roots are..."
