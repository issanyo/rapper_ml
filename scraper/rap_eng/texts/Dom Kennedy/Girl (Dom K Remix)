[Verse 1] (Dom Kennedy)
Hop off the plane, get picked up
Parrot, Grey Goose, cranberry still the mixture
Hit the dim switch then switch on the fixture
If I was blindfolded, man, I could still pick her

[Chorus] (Girl Singing)
Girl
If they don't know your worth
Tell 'em you're my girl
And anything you want is yours

[Verse 2] (Girl Singing)
Passion burning, causing rapture of laughter
Pressure building, falling faster and faster
If I told you that you rock my world, I want you around me
Would you let me call you my girl, my girlfriend, my girlfriend?
I can give you the life you deserve, just say the word, baby
And I got you, darling, I got you

[Chorus] (Girl Singing)
Girl
If they don't know your worth
Tell 'em you're my girl
And anything you want is yours

[Verse 3] (Girl Singing)
Chapters turning, so old fashioned and natural
Potions got me falling for you, oh yeah
Baby if I told you that you rock my world
I want you around me
Would you let me call you my girl, my girlfriend, my girlfriend?
I can give you the life you deserve, just say the word
And I got ya and I…

[Chorus] (Girl Singing)
Girl (you're mine)
If they don't know your worth
Tell 'em you're my girl
And anything you want is yours
Girl
If they don't know your worth
Tell 'em you're my girl
And anything you want is yours
Girl
If they don't know your worth
Tell 'em you're my girl
And anything you want is yours
Girl
If they don't know your worth
Tell 'em you're my girl
And anything you want is yours

[Verse 4]
I left my chronic in El Segundo
Eat at Ramona's right across from Elco
Hit you with my arrow, spit Valero
This is about life, skip dinero
I'm in a good space if I'm talking like that
My Barnes & Noble membership still valid
So shout out to DJ Babu and Khaled
Steak with the seafood on top, side salad
Her lips look like they got something to say to me
Send me pics when you out of town, don't play with me
The shirts with your butt poking out them ok with me
Just tell them you my…
It's been awhile since I had one of those
I ain't never seen knee hole pants at the Grove
Might let you wear my jean jacket when it's cold
Game so seasoned, even when it's a hundred out in Phoenix, tell em you my…

[Chorus] [x2]
