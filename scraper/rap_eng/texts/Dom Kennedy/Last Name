[Verse 1: Hit-Boy]
Pirellis on the wheel, models for the real
Come through our post, I stay in the hills
Bitches in the kitchen, yeah they sorttin' pills
After she crush 'em up, I gotta crush her up
Got a crush on this bread, I can't get enough
Penthouse sweet, ain't big enough
Producers in the game, ain't Hit enough
Don't talk to me about no hoes, you ain't hit enough
Who fuckin' with you when the lights go down?
What is gon' land on when the dice roll out?
Backwoods smoke by the pound
Had my nigga Sonny break it down, yeah
Gallardo keep me sane, too much on my brain
Too much on my plate, I can't take a brake
Sayin' grace at the table, I got it from Bey
Prayin' they let Big Hit off of his case
Run the whole office, I stay in the race
Still pink [?] at the bottle, she making mistake
Put moms in the new addie, I can not complain
Get to it, that's my motto, we won't ever change

[Chorus: Sample & Dom Kennedy]
[?] still the same
If I ever change [?]
Put that on my last name
Want somebody that's gon' pay your bills, ah-ha?
Never met nobody this real, ah-ha?
Have some safe sex while we chill, ah-ha?
Screamin' Half-A-Mil, screamin' Half-A-Mil

[Verse 2: Hit-Boy]
I just took the fronto to the face (ah-ha?)
Got my shit movin', fast pace, yeah (ah-ha?)
Stickin' to the script, we on Ace (ah-ha?)
By 21 year old got [?] on her waist (Half-A-Mil)
That might get her bills paid
Park the Vintage in the driveway, uhh
Slide off in the Wagon with Dom K
Still trippin' on how I made millions with Kanye
I been swinging for the fences, nothin' but big business
She know my name, but not my face, I'm not offended
Shit, usually you can catch me in the tuck
Your niggas pullin' stunts, my niggas pullin' up
Four door under my arm, like a [?]
Diamond rings, watch how they buss
Fuck it man, I'm all out of trust
Y'all do ya shit, but y'all ain't hard as us
Get to it [?] accounts tomorrow comin'
Bars nice like a nigga that needs to borrow somethin'
Game go how it go, you gotta love it
Snake niggas, your karma comin', uhh

[Chorus: Sample & Dom Kennedy]
[?] still the same
If I ever change [?]
Put that on my last name
Want somebody that's gon' pay your bills, ah-ha?
Never met nobody this real, ah-ha?
Have some safe sex while we chill, ah-ha
Screamin' Half-A-Mil, screamin' Half-A-Mil
Screamin' Half-A-Mil, screamin' Half-A-Mil
