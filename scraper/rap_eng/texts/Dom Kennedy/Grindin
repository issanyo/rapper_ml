Answer the phone when a real nigga call

[Hook]
Grinding, nigga out here shining
Early in the morning check the Rolly with the diamonds
Grinding, grinding, grinding, grinding..

[Verse 1 - Dom Kennedy]
Grinding, damn I got good timing
Your niggas is falling off and my niggas is climbing
Run it, other people's money
Tell em don't leave, girl, the real niggas is coming
Comic, sell it like an onion
I Fuck with Casey Veggies, nigga, that my Lil young'un
Bumpin, on my way to function
Pull it up in the front, damn this shit look like it's jumpin
Jumpin’, this my introduction
Mom calls me "Dom", girl I smash it like a pumpkin
Punking, girl you really fronting
If it's not with you, bet I be leaving here with something!
Quote it, she tryna get promoted
Took me to the bathroom and you ain't even notice
Yeah, I guess we call that "groupie love"
I made her get in that jacuzzi tub

Grinding, nigga out here shining

Grinding, grinding, grinding, grinding..

[Verse 2 - Dom Kennedy]
Grinding, you so far behind it
I be going shopping for that shit you don't be buying
Flying, everybody trying
Wanna be the king, but I'm a little lion
Eating, I ain't talking vegan
We at Benihana like twice on every weekend
Keep it: that's our little secret
If you don't tell him, he would never think you cheating..
I'm ready, come give me my heady
You don't need school, girl, you know so much already!
Deadly, I'm like that nigga Freddy
One phone call turns these niggas to confetti
Quote it, you have been demoted
Your album came out, damn and we ain't even notice
We call that a "floppy disc"
This that Gucci Shirt, Versace shit…
