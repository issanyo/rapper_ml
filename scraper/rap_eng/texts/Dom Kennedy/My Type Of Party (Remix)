Huh, Japollonia, Dom
Let's go

[Hook: Mila J & Dom Kennedy]
My girl got a cute face
Her friend got a nice body
We just tryna have fun
This my type of party
It's twenty niggas in the lobby
Twenty bitches in the lobby
They all drinkin', they smokin'
This my type of party

[Verse 1: Mila J]
I'm hittin' switches in the low
Me and my bitches, we dope
Watch, we already know
We just partying fo' sure though
Try to be with this photo
Japollonia solo
Tell everybody that you know
This is where you need to be fo' sure

[Verse 2: Dom Kennedy]
I hang with niggas that'll dodge ya
I hang with niggas that'll rob ya
I came wit hoes and they squabbin'
So you don't want no problems
So you don't want no problems
So you don't want no problems
So you don't want no problems
So you don't want no problems

[Verse 3: Mila J]
I hang with bitches that are thots
I hang with bitches that'll rob you
Got a problem, just gobble
Got a problem, just holer
Gettin' money, not that s'posed to
Gettin' checks, control shit
Gettin' checks, control shit
So come party wit me
This is my type of party

[Verse 4: Dom Kennedy]
This is my type of party
Makin' money like Oakland
Do it big like I'm sauser
Never drink King Cobra
Gettin' head on the sofa
OPM is over, nobody is colder
You niggas sniffin' that coka
I don't even drink soda

[Verse 5: Mila J]
Niggas up in here drinkin'
Niggas up in here rollin'
Niggas up in here chokin'
Skip the blunt, I ain't smokin'
And the party is droppin'
Niggas all in here jockin'
We ain't plannin' on stoppin'
We're sorry for party rocking

[Verse 6: Dom Kennedy]
Get the girls like a owner
Livin' life like a stoner
You can hit, I don't own her
Money give me a boner
My 'parment look like an owner
I got hoes in Arizona
They got a college diploma
And my watch got pneumonia

[Hook]
You nigga got a cute face
Her friend got a nice body
We just tryna have fun
This my type of party
Twenty bitches in the lobby
Twenty niggas in the lobby
They all drinkin', they smokin'
This my type of party
