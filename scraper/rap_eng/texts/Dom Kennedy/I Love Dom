[Verse 1]
Toot that, love the way you shoot that
Just got her hair did she tryna get her groove back
Touch it like a iPad, baby I’m a true Mac
Real nigga coming through everybody move back
Walked through the back door, they was like "whose that?"
6’1 brown skin sagging in my new hat
Had to look back when you passed cause it’s too fat
She told me come over right now she got a new wax
Them other hoes gone, baby girl you back
Don’t throw the ice in the trash we can use that
Got a nice bra on, baby we can lose that
Don’t say you a pro, I'mma make you prove that
I LOVE DOM
That should be your new tat
I just wanna hit that, I can be your new bat
Walk up in the house 3am where the food at?
I’m tryna have it ready when I’m finished fuckin you (ah)
See a nice couch, but where I’m fuckin you at?
Don’t grab my ____ so hard you can bruise that
I know yo boyfriend just mad cause he do rap
But don't be on my nuts, nigga its a food tax
Hit em wit the new blue and white just be cool hat
Number 8 Jordans unlaced wit the two straps
This is not a game or anything I can lose at
I'm standing right here, this where you should choose at

[Chorus]
I got her going DOM, got her going DOM
I never really let a nigga ever meet my mom
But I been sorta maybe thinkin you can be the one
I been sorta maybe thinkin you can be the one
When I do hit I’m talkin shit before I’m done
I know you prolly wanted to fuck wit me since we was young
I know you go slow when you tryna get me sprung
I know you go slow when you tryna get me sprung

[Verse 2]
Maybe I’m the one, maybe I’m the two
Maybe I’m the nigga that you call when you through
Don’t even trip I got other hoes too
Maybe I didn’t even really wanted to fuck wit you?
Had one drink now you gettin’ a lil loose
All cranberry bitch thats a lil goose
I’m the best nigga that you know near the booth
And if it’s any doubt in yo mind here’s the proof
Everything I said last week was the truth
How many girls can I have till I’m through?
I don’t really know what these other niggas do
But you ain't heard nobody like me since Snoop
Them the Bo Jacksons that I had in ‘92
I'mma stay fresh bitch thats just what I do
Burnside Boyz nigga reppin for my crew
And she tell me I can get it but I’m never in the mood

[Chorus]
Look I got her goin DOM, got her goin DOM
I never really let nobody ever meet my mom
But I been sorta thinkin maybe you can be the one
And I been sorta thinkin maybe you can be the one
But when I do hit I’m talkin shit before I’m done
I know you prolly wanted to fuck wit me since we was young
I know you go slow when you tryna get me sprung
I know you go slow cause you tryna get me sprung
Tryna get me spung
