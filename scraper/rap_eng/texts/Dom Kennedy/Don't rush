[Intro: Will Smith, Dom Kennedy, Myles Parrish]
"Make a choice, you just decide, what's it's gonna be, who you're going to be, how you're going to do it, just decide, and then from that point, the universe is gon' get out your way"
Aye, aye, aye
Aye, aye, aye
Aye, aye, aye (P-P-P-Lo, time to bring the bass back)
Aye, aye

[Chorus: Dom Kennedy, Dom Kennedy & P-Lo]
Got a little bitch bad as fuck, bad as fuck
Keep a lot of bands, stack it up, stack it up
1999, back it up, back it up
I just took my time
Nothing great happens rushed
Got a little bitch bad as fuck, bad as fuck
Keep a lot of bands, stack it up, stack it up
1999, back it up, back it up
I just took my time
Nothing great happens rushed

[Verse 1: P-Lo]
Aye, I just took my time, aye, uh
I ain't with the hype, aye
Get racks for this spitter with my guys, aye
I'm not nothin' nice, uh
Need my Jesus like a slice
Over time I get better like I'm wine, uh
Damn my bitch too fine, tell me somethin' that I don't know
Askin' why I got a pink phone, bitch that's rose gold
Baby 21, eat the meet like she a [?]
More racks then I don't go
Motherfuck that Volvo
I whip on them Royce, ain't no choice, aye
She say that I get her moist
I done rose up from the [?] like I'm Illonios, uh
Been the boy, I'm the man now, uh
Pillowtalkin, bitch that's man down
Came up from the dirt like the campground
Play tough, they just act now
I was in the background
Boppers with they ass out
Nothin' great happens from bein' rushed
Pay your mama's bill just for bein' nice

[Chorus: Dom Kennedy, Dom Kennedy & P-Lo]
Got a little bitch bad as fuck, bad as fuck
Keep a lot of bands, stack it up, stack it up
1999, back it up, back it up
I just took my time
Nothing great happens rushed
Got a little bitch bad as fuck, bad as fuck
Keep a lot of bands, stack it up, stack it up
1999, back it up, back it up
I just took my time
Nothing great happens rushed

[Verse 2: Dom Kennedy]
Poppin' all that talk
All I gotta say is y'all corny
And my back hurt, tell lil' baby come rub it for me
If you dance on me, baby take your time
Do it like it's mine
Play that bump and grind
I got automatic [?]
I can't fuck if she ain't fine
I got Bay Area ties, 'til they close both eyelids
I ain't with the hype
We got it on the flight
Smokin' out in Paris, on tour, real life
Favorite route to try
Her jaw was open wide
When I walk in lookin' fly
But that ain't no surprise
I know this lil' scrape bad as fuck
She got the ass shots, but I'm the one that make her blush
I'ma get it early in the mornin', Cap'n Crunch
Mac Dre lookin' down, smilin' on us
I'm feelin' myself
Roll the whole ocho
P-Lo in the club, uh
Dom in the club, uh
She might never come home

[Chorus: Dom Kennedy, Dom Kennedy & P-Lo]
Got a little bitch bad as fuck, bad as fuck
Keep a lot of bands, stack it up, stack it up
1999, back it up, back it up
I just took my time
Nothing great happens rushed
Got a little bitch bad as fuck, bad as fuck
Keep a lot of bands, stack it up, stack it up
1999, back it up, back it up
I just took my time
Nothing great happens rushed
