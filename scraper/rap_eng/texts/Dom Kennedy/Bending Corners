[Intro: Dom Kennedy]

True [x's 2]

[Krondon]

Unh, yeah

[Bridge: Krondon]
I know you heard me on the radiooo
See me in that new Mercedes thooough
Bending corners through the Crenshaw district
She gon' take a picture if her girlfriend miss it

[Verse 1: Dom Kennedy]
I'm feeling brand new so what's up honey
Used to buy her hush puppies w/ my lunch money
Told her "This that real, real", all steel doors one hand I got skills
Money to loan, let me know I'm giving deals
Throw a pair o' live Maine lobsters on the grill
Or is it Taco Mel season? Sunday at Dulans
Hustlin' every night from Monday to Tuesday
And what? They suffering? We ain't jealous
I be always coming sick, tell em
Your dream girls? I done hit several
She listening like "This shit clever", A 90's baby, thats a sick era
Black Nikes like I'm Chris Weber
Keep working, it's gon get better
That's all I can tell ya

Uh!

[Hook: Krondon]
I know you heard me on the radiooo
See me in that new Mercedes thooough
Bending corners through the Crenshaw district
She gon' take a picture if her girlfriend miss it

I know you probably seen my videooo
Name ringing bells through the city thooough
Bending corners through the Crenshaw district
She gon' take a picture if her girlfriend miss it

[Verse 2: Dom Kennedy]

Chilling w/ the homies, smelling the buuud
Line wrapped around to the back of the cluuub
In the spot you can't get in for a duuub
They won't let me in, say I'm dressed like a thug
Came through like Birdie in "Above The Rim"
Off camo hoodie under and a pair o' Timbs
Nah, for real rock vans w/ the [?] slims;
She'll do anything you want
I swear you better make that girl happy
Even if I have to drive a taxi
I will still have you eating crab meat
THEN hit you with the Laffy Taffy
A 90's baby, thats a sick era
She thinking ring and I just met her
Keep working, it's gon get better
That all I can tell ya

Uh!

[Hook: Krondon]
I know you heard me on the radiooo
See me in that new Mercedes thooough
Bending corners through the Crenshaw district
She gon' take a picture if her girlfriend miss it

I know you probably seen my videooo
Name ringing bells through the city thooough
Bending corners through the Crenshaw district
She gon' take a picture if her girlfriend miss it

[Outro: Dom Kennedy]

Yeah, Krondon
Aye, Aye
Yeah
