[Verse 1:]
Smoking out pulling up
Hit up tito's in my truck
Hoes they want it super sized
Fred Mack you call em slut
Every body wanna floss
But don't want to pay the cost
Pounds I been shaving off
Weed we been blazing off
I don't wanna stay and talk
Sold out in New York
Dreams of me in a porshe
Clean when I'm on the court
Poppin like it's on the 4th
I already got the torch
Bottles just without the cork

With models from Norstrums
Videos where niggas MC on em
You might see me out here in the new M3 on em
Phone in my hand like the young pimp c on em
Walking out the strip club
Gone with like three of em

Hook:
Smoking out pulling up
Smoking out pulling up
Smoking out pulling up
Smoking out pulling up
Hold up

Ima give her the keys cause she ain't even faded
In a authentic number fifteen Raiders

Hold up

[Verse 2:]
Switching lanes, screens falling
Chilling with darling Baldwins
Top floor, shots calling
Blowing that Bob Marley
Uh
What you know about them Texas boys?
Bubble eyed Lexus
Got me flexin like Iâ€™m Arnold Schwarzenegger
Fuck a hater
Riding candy now and later
Got that old school with them new shoes
Got them swangers
Got they head turning like it's voodoo
I'm almost famous
Got my baby going Koo Koo
How I slang it
Fly I'm out the hanger

Hook:
Smoking out pulling up
(oo this banging banging)
Smoking out pulling up
(oo this banging banging)
Smoking out pulling up
(oo this banging banging)
Smoking out pulling up
Hold up

Ima give her the keys cause she ain't even faded
In a authentic number fifteen raiders
