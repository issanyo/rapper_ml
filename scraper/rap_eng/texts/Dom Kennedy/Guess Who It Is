[Intro]
Yeah
This the part of the muthafucking game right here
We start diving in the end zone on y'all niggas
Cause we kicking y'all muthafucking ass like that nigga, yea
Aye what up nigga
My niggas moving in the Marina and shit
We fucking with the white people now
Niggas is making dates fucking tennis and shit nine in the morning
The fuck I'm talking about
And y'all niggas wanna talk about this...maaaan I ain't even fucking talk about that shit, nigga
We got bigger shit going on
Yeah
Uh

Lets get into it

[Verse]
Guess who's bizzack, you steal hand cracking my songs
I'll beat your ass with the back of my phone
Joe Pesci on the West beat, I'm Keyshawn at SC
I ball so much that I might just win an ESPY
I'm feeling like the next me, my video is next week
I'm so sucker free but theses niggas is trying to next me, ew
Gucci and a rack, so why would I battle rap
When girls see me out and be like oooou where my camera at
Niggas in the club I'm like ummm where my hammer at
I ain't for the stupid shit, I just want to handle that
Models in the throttle on Porsches with four horses
Telling the French waiter like man I need more oysters
The things I indulge in y'all dudes ain't exposing
Pinocchio ass niggas don't even stick your nose in, oh
Mr. Kennedy, titian like Tennessee
Not licensed to be fighting like Tyson I'm off this Hennessy
Smooth like Emmitt be
Nigga that wore twenty-three
Forty five and nine ones
Summer time is mine but
It's gon be a slight chill, liking how my life feel
Them other dudes don't kill it but the nigga on the mic will

South Beach, might chill, Daygo, I may go
You ain't even see how we connected like legos
You ain't even see I was bout to exit like Mase though
Right after the check cleared
You might not see me next year, shit
I've been a baller like Ben Baller
Fuck running for it, nigga I've been in office
I'm huge in July, I'm big in August
I'm ready to die, nigga I'm BIG in all this
Rap rebel shit, you ain't on my level bitch
The government is handing out coke so you better peddle it
The bar got a couple of cases I'm trying to settle it
Gold card go hard
My old bitch rock Goyard
My new bitch drink Old E
Bamboos, gold teeth
In five, four seats
Spikezz, color feet, please
I'm so often, holier than gold crosses
Niggas know me I'm so Slauson from Leimert park to Boston
Bean town to the Bronx I'm senile with the ugh
Back in 05 I would freestyle in some dunks
But now I ride around with me now in the truck
Yelling get out the way my nigga it's me now in the front
I'm bout to buy a Porsche put the cheese down in a month
Like come out the house ma that's me down in the front
I grinds like pepper, with dimes like Hefner
Might take you out to eat but the wine is like extra
I'm trying like catcher from behind like catchers
But things never seem to be aligned like Tetris
Yo girl mine like the West is
She say I'm so sick and she trying not to catch it
But I ride like a Lexus
Her body is like oh god and I'm trying not to bless it
I'm on fire where the exit
Dom is like a whole fucking choir with a message
Some nice attire when I'm stepping
My right side nice but I'm flyer on the left one
They say Im flyer than the Jetsons
Mesh Gucci loafs, niggas admire the selection, Yeah


[Outro]
Leimert ain't QB but still I'm never shook
Dom Kennedy is like little brother with better hooks
No castles just better crooks nigga
Yeah
Yeah
Yeah
