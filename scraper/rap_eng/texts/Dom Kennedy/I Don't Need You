[Intro]
See me and my Annie got a understanding that's so good. That an misunderstanding in this is understood. You finding me?

[Chorus: TeeFlii]
Girl, I don't need you
I don't need you
No, I don't
A little bit just won't do
A little bit just won't do
I don't need you
No, no, no, I don't need you
I don't need you
I don't need you
No, I don't need you

[Verse 1: TeeFlii]
You causing stress, shit is a mess
I really thought you loved me, but you really don't love me
I'm watching your actions, but they ain't the right actions
You won't catch me outside it
Girl, I do it just how a thug supposed to do it

[Pre-Chorus]
But you playing these games like a Playstation 4
All my annies get along
They know right from wrong
You better stop acting dumb, recognize what you got
Cause, I, I

[Chorus]

[Verse 2: TeeFlii]
You causing drama
Got two baby mamas that already cause me drama
You can't be [?]
But I'm like fuck it, life ain't never been fair
That's right, I trust my niggas way more than I trust you bitches
I thought that you loved me, but you loved me in a wrong way

[Pre-Chorus]
But you playing these games like a Playstation 4
[?]
There ain't no right from wrong
You better stop acting dumb and recognize I've seen your face
Cause, I, I

[Chorus]

[Verse 3: Dom Kennedy](TreeFlii)
Learn how to cook first then try to tell me how to do my job
I've been here every night
For the last five years with the car or a bike
Start getting nice
I just wanna stay out of trouble
You can't always be humble
Man, I'm just trying to carry the rock
And niggas wanna see me fumble and it's hard getting old
Cause now I look at homes and stuff
And I don't wanna be on the phone this much
Oh yeah, I'm sure, this might be the fifth tour
Really ain't home too much
I'm on niggas like a bus pass for the hate that they must have
Thirty thou in the duf bag, girl with a plump ass
Smell the weed when we come past
Car service when we come past, I don't need you
(Go ahead tell motherfuckers what have you done)
Never have, never will
See me switch lanes in a Benz for real
Should have a movie like the Man of Steel
Or have a movie like Fade to Black
Get your homegirl, she a fan for real
[?] two chickens how it's supposed to go
They had to get down on their hands and heel

[Chorus]
