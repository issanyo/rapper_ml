Yeah
Too much, ay
Too much, ay
Ay

[Chorus]
(Ya) Ya body look good in that dress
But it look much better when it's bouncin' on me
(Ay) I think about you so much
Real talk, even when I'm with another woman
Living downtown was too much
Every night the doorman meet another woman
I could have a statue downtown

[Verse 1]
Been hustlin' out here all day
I could finally kick back when you comin' honey
Everybody know
Closed mouths ain't gettin' nothin'
You can't take it with you anyway
It's just money baby
I wanted to three years ago
But you was runnin' from me
Had to find somebody out here
Tryin' to give it to me
Everybody know
Closed mouths ain't gettin' nothin'

[Dom Kennedy talking]
I mean.. Quit asking me where I been you know what I'm sayin'? Both my bathrooms marble, I'm good. What's up with Y'all ladies though?

[Chorus]
(Haha) Ya body look good in that dress
But it look much better when it's bouncin' on me
(Ay) I think about you so much
Real talk, even when I'm with another woman
Living downtown was too much
Every night the doorman meet another woman
I could have a statue downtown

[Verse 2]
I'm hopin' you the one
Like Penny in central Florida
I be wishin' it was more of it
I bottle it up
No foolish pride when I'm around you
I swallow it up
I might follow this up
With a dozen of 'em
Long stem roses
'Cause you so gorgeous
And we gettin' close
Let's just toast
To you
To me
To this
You don't even have to be convinced
It's so obvious
By the time you hear this
I'll have a smile on my face
Goin' hard like I got a child on the way
Stay catchin' thick girls at the concert
Smellin' good in them high heels
That make they feet hurt
I know

[Chorus]
(Yo) Ya body look good in that dress
But it look much better when it's bouncin' on me
(I know) I think about you so much
Real talk, even when I'm with another woman
Living downtown was too much
Every night the doorman meet another woman
(Yeah) I could have a statue downtown
