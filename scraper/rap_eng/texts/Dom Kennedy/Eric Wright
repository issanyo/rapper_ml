[Verse 1: Dom Kennedy]
Always playin' tenderoni, when I smashed off
Took her straight home after last call
Do what you want, if your cash large
Told her its a rap, please forget it
Take the sauce and exit, don’t pass that
Might see OPM on the NASDAQ
Might see Half-A-Mil in the playlist
Me and HB running the grave shift
We getting faded, when it’s dark out
And walking in the club, like it's our house
Tell your man chill, he on his fourth foul
I might be on my fifth whip
I play it like some Big Wiz
And nah, I don’t forget shit
Y’all act, like I owe y'all something
Get a bottle, get a chick, man
Roll y’all something
Got one Impala stock, one Impala customed
Girls wanna cuff him, bringing up Truxton's
This like a nigga in the playoffs, bussin'
I might drop 50 for the titties in the stands
Them crazy girls, VIP, 5 bands
7 girls on stage, my niggas ain't playin'
We get shit popping, like Eric-fuckin'-Wright
She be in this bitch, going hard, every night
You fuck around and might get attached
And always wanna know where she at
I’m still waking up by myself
Cause the words that I say, make everything melt, yeah

[Bridge: Dom Kennedy & Hit-Boy]
She already knew my name
VIP, 5 bands
And its like how you pass the mic to a nigga
Yeah

[Verse 2: Hit-Boy]
She already knew my name, she ain't have to read my jersey
Saw my Zoomin' chain and she started acting thirsty
Finna put up 30, like we at The Forum
Big game, James Worthy, pullin' off in a foreign
Swisher sweets, fresh from the Shell station
My OG said: "Young nigga, be patient"
Blowing big tree, foggin' up the window
C cups in her tee, I use 'em for pillows
Old white people starring at me, in my Chevy
While I get the bass right and adjust the settings
"When can I hit again?", Girl, that’s just a question
Niggas switched up on me, I call that a blessing (hallelujah)
This year I gotta double up the sales tax (yeah)
Still on your head, like a wave cap (yeah)
I still hit your friend with the fake ass

[Bridge: Dom Kennedy, Hit-Boy & Jay 305]
Early morning send her home, in them Ray Bans
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
She already knew my name
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
She already knew my name
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
She already knew my name
Let it hang, let it hang, ha, ha, ha

[Verse 3: Jay 305]
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
305 beating, two twelves charlie (uh-uh)
In the Hemi skittin'
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
Why you niggas mad?
Alexander Wang, diamond fangs on your bitch ass
Go hard or take your ass home, OPM rule
Take that choker off, bitch you grown, you look like a damn fool
Skrt-skrt-skrt on your ass (skrt-skrt-skrt)
I ain't got no Porsche, I got a mac
Shoot your ass up, then hit Sam's, ahh
Look at this, niggas look confused like
How you get the R8, top rank
Whole blue lobster, black mobster
Go place, smoke grape, red green rasta
IPhone 8 came out and I’m still thuggin'
Bitches on Basketball Wives ain’t got no husbands
Bitch I’ll never be married
I’ll never be your husband
I couldn’t be your daddy
I probably fucked your cousin'

[Outro: Dom Kennedy, Hit-Boy & Jay 305]
She already knew my name
She already knew my name
She already knew my name
I never had no love for her
