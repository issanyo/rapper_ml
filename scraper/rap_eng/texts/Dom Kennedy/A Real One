[Verse 1: Zeke]
I like my girls in heels and timbs
I like em in the kitchen and in the gym
I like em tall, short, thick and slim
Long as that sex appeal's on 10
You gotta be down and know the deal
Play your grown up role we chill
And on and on and on and on
Champagne we pour with patron

[Verse 2: Jay305]
Uh, Jay305 crusin
Listen boos and winning with the winners
Yeah, ya mans a loser
If you knew better you'd do better baby
Go head and lose em
Watching you watching me
Go head and choose up
I been here before
Got too much game to exchange with you hoes
Chest hair showin, gold chain on you hoes
18 karat cardia frames on you hoes
Im a real nigga doe

[Chorus: Zeke]
My card do your thing you can eat right
You down with the crew and its for life
I gotchu, you got me, we  stay tight
Thats what i represent, yeah thats what i represent
Im loyal, my word's what i live by
I talk good, my walk good, my shoes fly
She with me, no hickies, the smart type
Thats what i represent, yeah thats what i represent
A real one (a real one), A real one something you can feel on
A real one (a real one), A real one something you can feel on

[Verse 3: Polyester}
I know you sick and tired of that old thang
But don't bring used bullets to the gun range
We can pop at the top of the food chain
Theres so many ways to love a woman
Let me count the ways

[Verse 4: Dom Kennedy]
5,4,3,2 told her you're the 1
See that cliquo on the table could you pour me some?
And you looking more expensive than my recording fund
And ion be tongue kissing unless I'm border some
I'm out here getting chose
Tryna get it how i know
Having big bank rolls
Supreme tags all on my clothes
You niggas been exposed, say cheese
This is for my ladies
She say i fuckin hate you Dom because she can't replace me

[Chorus: Zeke]
My card do your thing you can eat right
You down with the crew and its for life
I gotchu, you got me, we  stay tight
Thats what i represent, yeah thats what i represent
Im loyal, my word's what i live by
I talk good, my walk good, my shoes fly
She with me, no hickies, the smart type
Thats what i represent, yeah thats what i represent
A real one (a real one), A real one something you can feel on
A real one (a real one), A real one something you can feel on
