[Verse 1]
Hit me
We started off small from the ground up
Wasn't looking for the fame, but it found us
People ask "Dom what you chasing down?"
Hmm, take nine hundred thousand
And nigga, round up
Ain't never begged in my life
Nigga's hound us
Them boys pressin you? Shit
They always pound us
Ask my man in NY, how I sound brah?
He replied "Shit we know how you get down son"
I recognize a lame nigga when I'm around one
But I look like a clown try'na clown one
A new Coretta Scott King I think I found one
Man I'm through with y'all hoes I think I'll crown one
I been sitting on these bars
You can down one
I been leading the whole time
You been down one
I don't rap about the hood I come down like (gunshots)
Yeah I'm from round one

[Verse 2]
I was just telling my moms
When I hear my songs I be feeling like Braun
No Corey Matthews, I be feeling like Sean
Yeah I finally got a job
Is you feelin that Mom?
My Dad asked me why I wasn't signed yet
I said obviously because you never rhymed yet
And my watch say "Nigga it ain't yo time yet"
I ain't have enough time to do Dom yet
But errbody ask my for an estimate
And wanna take my style, look I ain't even perfected it
I ain't even saying I'mma perfectionist
But at least let me pursue it on some Lexus shit
Cause I don't wanna be screwed on some Texas shit
Twenty years later saying I blew it on some reckless shit
The city locked up on some necklace shit
So if you got other plans, you should exit it
The game need niggas that's affectionate
Not just a bunch of niggas wantin' checks and shit
Not just a bunch of niggas wantin' sex and shit
Dissin the same niggas that they textin with
I'm textin a nigga girl like yo man suck
Meet me up at Autobahn, tell him get his hands up

[Verse 3]
Let me drop some math on em
Nah fuck that let me drop my ash on em
Put em in a room and turn the gas on em
Nobody saw a thing, put a mask on him
He a threat to the public put a task on him
When you going through his pockets put a stash on him
Shoot him one time but don't blast on him
Break a man's soul and put a cast on him
The game so cold so many snake brothers
We can't even realize who really take from us
From "Watermelon Sundae" to "I Hate Summers"
I got big self esteem, but I stay humble
I say Leimert Park was cool
They say Leimert Park was new
Maintainin, bunch of niggas complaining
For my birthday I bought me two Cuban chains and
I try to tell my boys that we more than entertainment
And I'm leaving with a different girl than I came with
And still and all we just this close
Waking up early so we don't miss this boat
I said still and all I'm just this close
I'm stayin up late so I don't miss this boat

And a uhh Leimert Park was cool
I say Leimert Park What's cool
I say Leimert Park What's cool
I say Leimert Park What's cool
I say Leimert Park What's cool
I say Leimert Park What's cool
I say Leimert Park What's cool
I say Leimert Park What's cool
I say Leimert Park What's cool was cool
Leimert Park was cool
Yo
