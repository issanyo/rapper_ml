(Intro)
Half-A-Mil
Everytime, yeah...
Look, yeah...

(Chorus: Hit-Boy & Dom Kennedy)
We don't pop pills, pop tops on the Hennesey
Three red cups later, it's finally hitting me
Skiped class, still made history
G-class, been past chemistry
We don't pop pills, pop tops on the Hennesey
Three red cups later, it's finally hitting me
It's finally hitting me

(Verse 1: Hit-Boy)
I'm like RJ, I'm off the Hennebito!
Even when I'm faded, I watch how I speak though
Your closest might turn into amigo
I see the same freaks every city we go
R.I.P. to the Nate, roll the whole 8
Drop that Half-A-Mil, she know the whole tape
Incoming text from an old flame
She want that old thang
Bossin' over the [?] both close lake
Meet me in the parking lot
I got something to spark
Call me as soon as you park
You can never say I kept you in the dark
And I can never let you play me closely
Even rappers hatin' on me
Grab that cognac and [?]

(Chorus: Hit-Boy & Dom Kennedy)
We don't pop pills, pop tops on the Hennesey
Three red cups later, it's finally hitting me
Skiped class, still made history
G-class, been past chemistry
We don't pop pills, pop tops on the Hennesey
Three red cups later, it's finally hitting me
It's finally hitting me

(Verse 2: BC)
Bitch, think I'm tripping off her, well sorry I don't fall for hoes
Line em up baby knock them down like dominoes
Guarenteed I got one everyday of the week
Get Around, Get Around, like 2-P-A-C!
Please don't act crazy got that thang on me
Finna had me started up, gotta stay low key
Cause I don't need them old bums, fuck them aging
Niggas tryna say they want sign me cause [?]
Banks in the addie, I ain't puttin' in my [?]
Niggas still thuggin', I ain't even check [?]
Money still dirty, and [?] got a ransom
Even if it ain't bout the church, nigga hell [?]
Pullin' off in the back to back trucks, like the President
If it ain't about the money, nigga, it ain't relevant
Shawty way too thick, yeah, nigga, ain't no mercy
Bringing it to [?] secrets, baby, like some [?]

(Chorus: Hit-Boy & Dom Kennedy)
We don't pop pills, pop tops on the Hennesey
Three red cups later, it's finally hitting me
Skiped class, still made history
G-class, been past chemistry
We don't pop pills, pop tops on the Hennesey
Three red cups later, it's finally hitting me
It's finally hitting me

[Verse 3: Dom Kennedy]
My only position is to be thankful
Spread only positive information
Practice discipline, practice patience
I won't be exceeding those limitations, uh
Jacuzzi is full, it's a situation, yeah
Only the real ones got a visitation, yeah
Lying on me, these niggas is hatin'
I might [?] to Cayman
And I only smoke flavorin'
Her eyes so tired, look like she Asian
Down Sunset, like I'm parading
On the car-phone talking with Van Davis

[Bridge: Hit-Boy]
We don't pop pills, pop tops on the Hennesey
Three red cups later, it's finally hitting me
It's finally hitting me

[Outro: Tag]
Half-A-Mil...
