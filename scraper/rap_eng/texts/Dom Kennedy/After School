[Verse 1: Dom Kennedy]
If I make it to heaven
I hope they're still drinking brew
I hope I get to see Nick
Me and him have a few
Talk about '96
The shit that y'all never knew
When we was stealing Polos
Then wear it up to the school
Hell nah we wasn't broke
We just acted a fool
Shirt tucked into our jeans
We just thought it looked cool
You can say what you want
But that don't make it the truth
When its 91 outside
Bet it's 69 in my coupe
The A/C blowing strong
And we smoking that Ohh
Her homegirl is looking good
Yeah I was scoping that too
But I heard you got her pregnant
Thats whats up when y'all due?
Then somebody knocked on my door
Nick I'm hoping thats you

[Hook]
But that's a dream deferred
And they don't always come true
4 minutes 'til 4
The bus ride after school
If I make it to heaven
I hope it comes with a view
So I could see LA
Niggas know how I do
Fuck with me and get smoked
Or fuck with me and smoke too

[Verse 2: Dom Kennedy]
Yellow Album so good
Niggas thought it was a fluke
Niggas thought I was on the juice
Yeah nigga it was the goose
And the bitches shaking they ass
I'm like, "damn what it do?"
She like, "damn can we fuck?"
Call me up and come through
Watch whatever you want
Champagne in there too
Niggas know what I sip
Tats on both of my wrists
"In Loving memory of hip hop"
I got that in '06"
A nigga so West Coast
You can tell by my clique
You can tell how I dress
You can tell by my whip
Most LA niggas I know
Some no longer exist
And they got moms just like me
If I could grant them one wish

[Hook]
But that's a dream deferred
They don't always come true
4 minutes 'til 4
The bus ride after school
If I make it to heaven
I hope it comes with a view
So I could see LA
Neighbors and the Pirus
Fuck with me and get smoked
Or fuck with me and smoke too

[Bridge: Dom Kennedy]
Niggas know how I do
Bitches know how I do
If I make it to heaven
I hope it comes with a view
I gotta see LA
And keep an eye on y'all fools
A nigga is so West Coast
You can tell by my clique
You can tell how I dress
You can tell by my whip
The LA niggas I know
Some no longer exist
And they got moms just like me
If I could grant them one wish

[Hook]
But that's a dream deferred
They don't always come true
4 minutes 'til 4
The bus ride after school
If I make it to heaven
I hope it comes with a view
If I make it to heaven...yeah
