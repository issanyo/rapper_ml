[Verse:]
I’m the best here he comes I’m the best
Here he comes I’m the best
Here he comes here comes the best [x2]
Here he comes here comes the west
Check out beyond look around like who’s next
I can't do second best i don't take less
More I’m doing the more they say that’s a lie
You seen my commercials by now you hot
Aren't you lonely at the top but I’m going any way
I can do this any day i will still be right here
I prosper anyway the rest dont like me
But the kids want to grow up and be just like me
I came from the streets likely
Tonight i might make five beats
Then put it in the bed like sheets
I’m number 25 on my team
That mean there ain't nothing getting past don't ask
Don't try it MVP i don't buy it stop lying
Trying to say I’m the best you seen I know
So when i say OPM until it's over you all know
It's the best
Here he comes here comes the best [x2]
