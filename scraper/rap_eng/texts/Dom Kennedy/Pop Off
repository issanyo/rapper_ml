[Intro]
(Radio) Yeah, yeah, aw man

[Hook: Casey Veggies]
Party at the spot, it's the pop off
Yeah this shit real, ain't no knock off
Real west side winner where it pop off
Don't say nothing to me when it pop off
When it pop off, yeah it's gon' pop off
That's a lame nigga, he is so soft
Chilling with some women when it pop off
Ain't worried bout nothing, it's gon' pop off

[Verse 1: Casey Veggies]
Yeah they be on it when it pop off
I hear them boys talking but they not involved
My podna got some shit that keep the problems solved
I got my game face on for when it's poppin' off
For a hundred grand, name a rapper I'll knock 'em off
I never see you out when it's poppin' off
You the type of nigga try to pay to trust
Still I hate it but gotta get your paper up
Swear I spit that shit that'll save you bruh
I'm my own hero and I never give it up
Give me double digits it can pop off
I be on my business and my rap shit
Either these girls really love a nigga
Or they do a good job acting
So sad saying she shouldn't fuck with me
But I give her too much satisfaction

[Hook: Casey Veggies]

[Verse 2: Dom Kennedy]
Twenty five bottles tryna pop off
Call for ten more get 'em dropped off
Any rapper you know, he'll get knocked off
In a white Porsche with the top off
Went between my legs like I'm Hot Sauce
In a Jordan jersey I'm a hot dog
Dom and Young Veggies, get ready
Party at the all white crib look like Belly
Low top Air Force Ones just like Nelly
Can't be in a real relationship til I'm married, ayy
Now everywhere I go I'm seeing cop cars
My little cousins think I'm a rockstar
The team gon' shoot when the clock starts
OPM baby, hit the pop charts
I got a AMG them the stock parts
If you can't cook, make a Poptart

[Hook: Casey Veggies]

[Verse 3: Casey Veggies]
Name a rapper I get him, he get knocked off
Talkin' nonsense you catch lockjaw
Spitting all that shit that a nigga saw
You ain't fuckin' with me, tryna build a wall
Only got one life, I'm tryna get it all
They say a black go getta it's against the law
They wanna see us fail so we live it up
If I go to jail man I'm breaking out
Put your body in a cell, put the mind free
To do what you wanna do, be what you wanna be
Live life, stay blessed, see what you wanna see
One thing I know you'll never find another me
She tried to run a tool with this wannabe
It's like I got a gold mine in front of me
Champagne topped off when it pop off
Me and my dogs PNC I'm a mob boss
Veggies
