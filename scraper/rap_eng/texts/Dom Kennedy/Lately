[Intro]
Yeah, turn it up
Uh
Yeah
Aight

[Verse 1: Dom Kennedy]
I grew up sandwiched up
Between my oldest sister and my youngest one, Danica
I didn't have plans for much, just lamping up
And used to confuse nice things with the fancy stuff
I'm a back in the day nigga
I'm a westside Crenshaw official L.A nigga
Money still don't make me
You don't wanna see a nigga pull out off safety
Your girl still wanna date me
She wanna hit the mall, I'm here come take me
Tell her just don't rape me
Bust a nut, give her dap, tell her get home safely

[Hook]
Lately, Lately
When I roll up heads turn my tops up
Lately, Lately
Niggas don't really want no problems
Lately we make all the girls strip at the pool party, summertime
I'm talking 'bout lately, I'm talking 'bout lately, I'm repping L.A
Lately that's what im talking 'bout

[Verse 2: Dom Kennedy]
I been up but it don't mean much
What's the good in being on when your whole fucking team's stuck
I'm trynna help lift their dreams up
I'm not happy in the playoffs I'm tryna pick some rings up
When life's hard get harder, think big think smarter
Be a boy, be a man, be a martyr
I used to catch a game with my father
And now I catch planes to Chicago
A nigga felt the pain of the bottom
And now I chalk game up in Harlem
2 gold chains, what's the problem
A nigga work hard so I got 'em
Them Jordans go hard so I got 'em
That nigga seen mines then he got 'em
So in us, we trust
Hoes down G's up
Spend money, re-up
School days, free lunch
Never quit, keep up
You gotta hit the weed once
Sky high, reach up
We don't like police much
One nation, teach us
God bless, peace up

[Hook]
Lately, Lately

Lately, Lately
Niggas don't really want no problems

I'm talking 'bout lately, I'm talking 'bout lately, I'm repping L.A
Lately that's what im talking 'bout

[Outro: Dom Kennedy]
Uh, yeah
Yeah, uh
One more time

In us, we trust
Hoes down G's up
Spend money, re-up
School days, free lunch
Never quit, keep up
You gotta hit the weed once
Sky high, reach up
We don't like police much
One nation, teach us
God bless, peace up

Put your peace..... up

[Hook: (fading out)]
Lately, Lately
