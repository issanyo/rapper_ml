[Verse 1]
This the thick girl anthem, I be looking handsome
You should tell yo mama, she gon' have a grandson
Niggas think we fucking, tell them we just dancing
I'mma let you touch it, girl why you keep on asking
Red leather jacket, girl call me Michael Jackson
Five shots later, we call it Johnnie Paxson
Money we be spending and money we be stacking
Gon' put up all these Franklins and we gon' spend these Jacksons

[Hook]
Girls on stage, making change, make it rain
We like clothes, good food, champagne, entertainment
We don't ever ask for much except trust, women lust
Every time a real nigga call yo phone, pick it up

[Verse 2]
This that girl where you going, I'mma need a moment
Heard you like it doggy, I just wanna bone it
I don't wanna borrow, I just wanna own it
I see you got yo homegirl, come plug her with the homie
We don't really care about much, live it up
Bank accounts, gold chains, spending bucks in a rush
We ain't never had help, it's just us, it's just us
Every time a real nigga call yo phone, pick it up

Girls on stage, making change, make it rain
Gi- girls on stage, making change, make it rain
Girls on stage, making change, make it rain
Gi- girls on stage, making change, make it rain

[Hook]
