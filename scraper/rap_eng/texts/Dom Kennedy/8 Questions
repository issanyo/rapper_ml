[Intro]
Leimert Park, California (what’s cool?)
You’re now rocking with
The Best (Best After Bobby) After Bobby

[Verse]
I just want to make it to twenty-five
And hip-hop every nigga I would be [?]
That shit drive me crazy, baby, and I
Hope you can understand why I’m rapping now
March 9th, I sat home in my room and cried
The nigga Pun was a personal favorite of mine
That shit drive me crazy, baby, and I
Really hope you whack niggas stop rapping now
If gangsta didn’t sell, would you still do it?
If [?] never happened, would you still music?
If hip-hop wasn’t cool, would you still choose it?
What if all these girls just wasn’t appeal to it?
What if no big labels, no deals to it
What if no gold chains, no grills to it
What if [?] never came, no meals to it
Just the niggas working in cotton fields do it
Can I count on you to be there to rap about luxury and talk about chains and how they fit so comfortably, nah
It probably be no love for me and that’s the main reason why Dom don’t fuck with it (what)
It ain’t no more to it
