[Verse 1: 24hrs]
No fake Rollie, on my way for mine
Ice cream truck, I was countin' dimes
Bag of chip with this white lemon-lime
Hahaha, enjoy life
I done did everything twice
And I don't mean that everything was right
Cleanin' up in the crib, mom playin' with me
I'm in love with Saint Laurent, but it could never fit me
Moved all around the world, never had a home
Told my girl I'm ride or die, and she is not alone
I touched my first million dollars, that's a big blessing
Told my brother "Be a dad, everything second"
If I tell you that I love you, then I love you
You can always call my phone when you in trouble
Sunday, momma made collard greens
Grew up watchin' Martin on the TV screen

[Chorus: 24hrs]
If I tell you that I love you, then I love you
If I tell you that I love you, then I love you
If I tell you that I love you, then I love you
Sunday, momma made collard greens
Grew up watchin' Martin on the TV screen

[Verse 2: Dom Kennedy]
You ain't gotta vouch for me, I'm gettin' mine
Key in the '63, watch it come alive
No fake Rollie, custom chains
After I get in her, she be walkin' strange
Reminisce on school days with the coffee cake
This industry don't love me, niggas all be fake
Had to learn the hard way, shit is cut-throat
But no amount of money can corrupt my soul
Balenciaga just to hold my iPad in
The big homie used to push a Wagoneer
If you talkin' checks, than I'm all ears
If you rode in my Porsche, then I love you

[Chorus: 24hrs & Dom Kennedy]
If I tell you that I love you, then I love you (Right)
If I tell you that I love you, then I love you (On God)
If I tell you that I love you, than I love you
Sunday, momma made collard greens (Uhh)
Grew up watchin' Martin on the TV screen
