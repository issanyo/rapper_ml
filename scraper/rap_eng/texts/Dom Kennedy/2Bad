[Hook: Tish Hyman]
You're too bad, baby, I just had to tell you
You're too bad and now I wanna get familiar
You're too bad, oh, gotta get to know ya
You're too bad, yeah, girl, you're too bad

[Verse 1: Dom Kennedy]
Bet they never saw this comin'
Size 5'6" crop top and hip-huggers
Cinnamon Big Red MAC gloss, her lips covered
Couldn't tell you how I felt then, hope this does it
And when we out in public, got you blushin' and all that
Hook my homeboy up wit' ya cousin and all that
We can hop in my third whip and swerve shit, my turn
Aye, how many times you heard this? (You're too bad)
But you don't make me nervous
I take you somewhere phones ain't got service
Grab a twelve-pack, let me nail that
Aye, I can't even smell that
And I can tell that you treat your body well
Gon' give 'em hell, yeah
We pullin' up for real, Benz like Denzel, yep
Watchin' Mo' Better Blues from rooms with way better views
If we talkin' 'bout for you, then it ain't no better dude, feel me?

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Dom Kennedy]
Aye, and I never saw this comin'
Runnin' through twelve-pack magnums, them big rubbers
Now she wit' OPM, we can do big numbers
Her old boyfriend realizin' he did love her
I wake up every mornin' same time, like ten-somethin'
Do some push-ups, couple crunches to "Been Thuggin'"
Hit the studio, [lighter flick], and I spend somethin'
Buy a house first, then I'm a go get my wrist flooded
Cause money get niggas in the club, the list doesn't
I only wanna wear my own clothes like Ben Hundreds
And stay in big casinos, navy chinos
All weed, nigga, no premos, haha yeah
Still watchin' Mo' Better Blues
Stay in, order food, white robe, get her nude (Woo)
From rooms with way better views
If we talkin' 'bout for you, then it ain't no better dude, feel me?
