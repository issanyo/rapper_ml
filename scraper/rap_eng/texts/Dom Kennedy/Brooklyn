[Verse 1:]
It's our first time together and she
Convinced that making love kinda boring
Yo i want to write a sad song
About knocking my pats off in the lining
You want me to show you ain't got lost cause
Calling me daddy and screaming my name
After that we put the whole haul into a flame so what you playing
That's like a barbie in a ride making it last forever
Damm i know you ain't tired oh let me slow down my flow
Give it to you how you like it baby nice and slow
I see the chance to get a real hero on the sack
Who ain't afraid to talk shit and spank it from the back
No doubt I’m about to make a mess on both towels
You really think you talking to a child
I guarantee baby for real if you stick it out you going to see how it feels
When we Goin in goin in goin in
I represent LA she was raised in Brooklyn
I represent LA she was raised in

[Verse 2:]
I want to hit it in the worst way
I’ve been working on this song since the first day
She like it when i talk like that
Make you OPM when i get off like that
More flesh than the freak fest pinch on her breast
After hennessy the privilege is the best
Way way homie many months ago
I was a young boy watching while you ran the show
Now the plan of taking over really be on
It's where the cash incharge and switch cars
One of a kind when it’s time to do mine
Red line in the whole shit press rewind
Later show on the screen while we smoke in here
Got her mouth wide open like she under a spell
But that's life ain’t got a lot of threats around
Miami heat some one take him up town maybe
I represent LA she was raised in Brooklyn
I represent LA she was raised in Brooklyn
