[Verse 1]
Every White girl wanna fuck a nigga in a Benz
Trust me on that one, love Cleopatra
And the Scarlett Johanssons, dog
Who gon’ mix my bath water with the Epsom salt
Might make her a first lady like Tipper Gore
Name the airport after me, we only moving forward

[Hook]
We can’t wait for the day King’s dream come true
And we can’t wait for the day King’s dream come true
Said we can’t wait
We can’t wait

[Verse 2]
So you invite yo friends, I’ll call my friends
We can watch Con Air, let that sink in
This 4K HD put me in the stores
I’m running white walls nicknamed it Forrest
Send her home happy like Peter North
Damn
Keep the popcorn I just need applause
So what’s the chances, I can get some candid
Time with you alone I been minding my own but
I wanna take you to the movies if you haven’t
Seen the one that’s out now let’s make it happen
Don’t be shy sip your martini keep it raw
Half Naomi Campbell half Kate Moss
Surrounded by Queens like a deck of cards

[Hook]
Time flies when you’re having fun
Time flies when you’re having fun
I wanna take you to the movies
I wanna take you to the movies

[Verse 3]
So at my funeral don’t talk about rap songs
Bury me with my 9 named it Matt Barnes
Wore Phat Farm, Rush you owe me for that one
More champagne, more Mr. Chow
House by the Canal what you drop for it
Other People’s Money what you got for us
I eat beats like beef ribs, collard greens, and yams
Hit my Fred Astaire
I’m just over-prepared
Turn your lashes to shreds
Go Antonio Banderas
The Monte Carlo SS
All the comments say “yes”
You ain’t getting no money
I spent that on two chairs
Recline on that

And we still got a long way to go

[Hook]
Go! Time flies when you’re having fun
Go! Time flies when you’re having fun
I wanna take you to the movies
I wanna take you to the movies
