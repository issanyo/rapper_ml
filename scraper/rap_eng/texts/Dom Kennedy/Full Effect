[Pre-Chorus]
Old school swang
Brand new boogie
Old school swang
Brand New boogie

[Verse 1]
Tigger ride wit me she a lifer
I treat her how I treat the song yeah I be nice to her
How you turn a introvert to a extrovert
I got a knack for the vibe vicea versea
My style is authentic unlike ya
I keep it all the 100 till the spikes up
And when I freak it now I freak it she get hyper
And when she feelin how she feel she get pipe

My style is retrofit
Progressive
While in rewind
To get my duckets sooner
Samaje Perine
Tryna recline with the ruler of my desires
Til I go senile
She's all I really need I'm
Still stuck in Dream mode
While I'm reminiscin
The day we met I've never settled since then
I like to meddle in malevolence
Make em into riddles that's my reverence
Stay behind the pistol
Like a Maravich

[Chorus]
She say she love that old school swang
Brand New boogie
Love the way I do it so I let her do it to me
I got old school swang brand new boogie mami feel the full effect when she standing next to me

Old school swang
Brand new boogie
Old school swang
Brand new boogie

[Verse 2]
It's just something bout the way a nigga rock his fits
And spit his flows
The way he dip dat whip
While he clockin dough
Yea he was born in 1990 off that 110 & Redondo
Where young niggas get brought up to be bosses and head honchos
So native to my land nigga don't Neva call me tanto
Got patnas I'm different places and they lacin niggas pronto boy don't
Trip on me cuz yea I'm doing my thang
My beat funky and she love how I swang
It might be yo girl his girl mane it's All the same
Don't want her running loose cut her off or sucka you should tame cuz they
Know my name and best believe they know the gang how we
Rock and roll and put the boogie with the bang I'm sayin
It's just a California thang
The only thing that's raining is this game
Yea every single day I hear em say...

[Chorus]
She say she love that old school swang
Brand New boogie
Love the way I do it so I let her do it to me
I got old school swang brand new boogie mami feel the full effect when she standing next to me

[Verse 3]
I’m just a West Coast nigga to the core
Her eyes lit up when she see me in the Porsche
And I took her to Gyu Kaku for the s’mores
And get it wet til it be making noise
I’m cool on the White Russian it’s a bit much
I’m a call you when I leave baby pick up
I hit the second date it took me 6 months
Flossin the red seats on the bench truck
Had her legs pent up (?)
When it comes to my love she’s defenseless
Might have taken me 30 minutes to invent this
God took 9 months to endow me
I’m tryna fuck with only girls that wow me
In the smoke drowning
Players in my surroundings
A pussy real soft and clean like that Downey
Dom the hardest singer out of LA County

[Chorus]
She say she love that old school swang
Brand New boogie
Love the way I do it so I let her do it to me
I got old school swang brand new boogie
Mami feel the full effect when she standing next to me

[Outro]
Old school swang
Brand new boogie
Old school swang
Brand New boogie
