Wolves out, baby

My barrel lean like therazine
Dream like raven king, cream like Medaheem
Cartel spark, well yard in the mezzanine
Swimming at the shark boll
Shark boll – guillotine
Hundred on the dark boards, go up on the big machine
Blowin at your entourage, whole squad been verines
Camouflage dons spits hella steam
Prophesize, we monopolize
Gotta get the green

Packs in my nap sack, roll up a swisha sweet
Light a spliff, life’s a bitch, freakin off with the team
All the shit I seen probably, probably should be dead now
Fuckin ZOMBiES smoke the bombast weed to the head now

It’s the semi-auto blowin through yo audio
My niggas pressure you and leave you in the pause mode
No movements, this reality music
The gun law is – if you got one you better use it
Bangin B convo, see yo way out
Before D jump over E and F U up like a G
So play silly, fill a 9 millie
Actin you bout this life, be for really
Face fightin, wanna stay up, yall niggas kill me
Everything, 215, it’s Gucci Philly
It’s Louie loaf with the smoke to be exact
Camouflage Dons, ZOMBiES, Statik Selekt

Is it’s 10 shots, we blowin off limbs
No suplems, don’t get it twisted, we not them
It’s a new wave, NWA
Trick it how you want it and it’s all I gotta say

The fame don’t change me, I still won’t fuck with you niggas
I still be on the streets, I still scream fuck religion
I ain’t scared of beef, come beak and put on a skilly
To biggest, to non-existance so fuck with my competition hoe, hold up

Both heads in competition
Your mortal visions, sacrilegious, spittin vivid pictures
Smoking with the same niggas, Montana flow
Wired into white cope that shot that kid on my block

I’m from a place where if we want it we take it
Gold teeth, two phones, driving in the basement
Two freaks, one me, it’s threesomes in the AM
Takeaway for curve shit, four blunts in one bag
Bodies in the basement, homicide cases
Prophesizing about multiplyin, part like we acres
Hater you ain’t on like the Lakers
I know I’m wrong but we done for, got the same shit
Smif-N-Wessun, one bullet, you’ll pick
3rd leg, I be putting in your back
Rhyme like life after death, had a full disc
Rhyme like all eyes on me, times full of shit
Glock blaze, cheap pins, smoking at the ball game
Sky bucks, up top only when the Knicks play
Smif-N-Wessun fine and OG in the swift blade
Before you cross a day, motherfucker look both ways

Motherfucker look both ways (both ways)
Motherfucker look both ways
