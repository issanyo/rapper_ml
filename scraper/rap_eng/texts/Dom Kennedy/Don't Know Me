[Intro: Hit Boy & Dom Kennedy]
Yeah, yeah
Backwood's lit, I'm lit too
AY AY AY AY
Its massive up here right now
HB87, O.P.M
Yeah, fuck what yall on
Yeah

[Verse 1: Hit Boy]
Don’t know me for doing shit
Rapping better than these niggas
Dressing better than these niggas
Finessing better than these niggas
Look, I live it how you never could all you need to know
Paid dues, I hate rules so I made my own
Pushing on a open road fighting off sleep
5am whipping solo until I eat
Major key don’t play me for cheap
Until you step it up nigga don’t play me a beat
That was said to me
The reason why my heart turned zero degrees
Now the chain on my chest that’s my rosary
Don’t get it fucked up yeah we straight
Tell your neighbor to take his hand out the collection plate
Or get struck down by the hand of God
Damn if I ain’t pass the fly
You fishing for lies
I’m a black panther with his fist in the sky
Even with a neuralizer ain’t no clear in my mind
Backspace on the bullshit
Flow like a preacher reading scriptures from the pulpit
Somebody daughter getting baptized in Molly water
Swimming in sand through them Hollywood parties
That’s the price of a missing father, distance momma
Two things she know best dick and drama
Fighting at the family reunion over the clobber
Got a LA bitch that’ll fight you over the Dodgers
Baby bust it open for a million followers
But we need orders to suite please make it bottleless
I got it bruh
Need more OGs to chop it up
Damn we gotta to get our knowledge up
Chasing dollars bruh
Need big cream
We got big teams
Applying big schemes
Yeah we gotta get this quick cream
Half-a-mil nothing less
Half-a-mil no stress
The family straight nigga pick up your weight

[Verse 2: Dom Kennedy]
Don’t know me for doing shit
But I’m rapping better than these niggas
Dressing better than these niggas
Finessing better than these niggas
I rep 3 letters, cashmere sweater
Left side for my car key
A SS on my large tee
So what’s the talking about
I live it how you never could I’m gone keep it blunt
Aston Martin’s and Corvette’s parked in the front
No fronts this time niggas gotta pay
On my king size shit need a lot of space
In the the Prada bubble coat get a lot of hate
Running with pretty hoes in a lot of states
What’s all the talking about
They got silencers for that
But keep it real I be modest on the track
But don’t me a favor
Don’t me a favor
Look, I’ll be good anyway
The new turbo might drop any day
Keep your ear to the beat niggas
Half-a-mil on repeat nigga
Don’t get your ass beat on assumptions
Your bathtub yellow my G
I mean I don’t take you niggas that seriously
I mean these niggas talking to the wrong dudes
Ask Snoop Dogg about me nigga Daz too
Might let Korupt do my ab-libs
He’ll say fuck all these busters
TSA pre-checks sped off through customs
Two in Miami yes indeed I crushed them
If you want to run a fade with me it’s nothing
I’m on king like every other day
In the 6-1 people ask if it’s a trade
More into the details into the females
I don’t have time to wait
I haven’t seen my gold Rollie in 2 years
Backstage bottles with tequila few beers
Coors Light I’m a real one
Look like she got double Ds let me feel one
West coast hall of fame member I’m still one
East coast niggas say Dom keep it real son
Rap my old shit to Nas
Royalty checks like Wyclef and (?)
You ain’t never seen 100 Gs
Marble all in the shower she don’t wanna leave
House party all girls and a lot weed

[Outro: Dom Kennedy]
Don’t know me for doing shit
But I’m rapping better than these niggas
Dressing better than these niggas
Finessing better than these niggas
For real
