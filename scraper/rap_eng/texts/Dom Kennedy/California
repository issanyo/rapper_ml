Aye Dom, so far I listened to your album
And I ain't heard nothing you can post up and smoke a Black to

We don't need you on this one
Ha ha, aye! Check it, aye!

Verse 1:
Y'all out of town niggas just don't understand
We ain't got the same mindset or the same plans
I done ran with my mans, instead of runnin' to the man
Two shows back to back, got paid 50 grand
And a nigga like "damn, why you on 'em so tough"
Talkin' that shit, cuz his bitch chose up
Tried to get my number in his face like "dammmmn,"
Then my nigga Jay 305 rolled up
PhreshCru attire, my niggas on fire
Them 15 inches wires, we put 'em on tires
Then roll up...pockets on swolla
Stand on Stockton, hearin' choppas, not sober
Sometimes I feel like I'm still supposed to be there
And when I stop in the hood, I see Lil' C there
I try to show them the hustle, instead of fortune and fame
It's a mental battle now, I tell 'em, put 'em on game
And niggas love how I do...
At the skatin' rink, Girbaud down, Nike shoes
...Them hoes love how I do
Drinkin' Hennessy on stage, House of Blues

Uh, cuz California is for gangstas
California is for gangstas
California is for gangstas, California
California is for gangstas
California is for gangstas
California is for gangstas, California

Verse 2:
Y'all out of town niggas just don't understand
We ain't got the same mindset or the same plans
I done ran with my mans, 'stead of runnin' to the man
Two shows back to back, got paid 50 grand
...I'm Dr. Dre to the streets
They wanna know when it's gone release !
I tell 'em I do big thangs for you
Switch planes for you, got a nickname for you
C..A..L..I
A lot of girls fly to the West Coast cuz we here
Marquita from junior high ?, man I hope that she there
All my niggas gone bubble, tell yo homegirls come
All of 'em is in trouble, we don't close 'til 1
Wake up at 1:30, In N Out 'fore it close
Catch me in the drive thru, then spin out on these hoes
....Cuz they love how I do
Linked up with Big Von in the Bay, power moves

Uh, cuz California is for gangstas
California is for gangstas
California is for gangstas, California
California is for gangstas
California is for gangstas
California is for gangstas, California
