[Verse 1]
It's looking better every day
So I be writing every night til I am known in every state
Tell them lil niggas that they can't fuck with heavyweights
And I be on my grind daily so shout out to Terry K
A full house of girls, man, shout out to Mary Kate
The way we pull up to my show drunk as fuck and very late
Wait up
You would swear we were some all-stars
It's 20 niggas back stage and we all stars
You know me the fitted hat and some All Stars
My mom calls me Dom baby put that in your call log
You know what
You make me wanna take your walls off
I just want to brighten your day before you jog off
Yeah, and this be that shit that you could blog off
I bet I take your heart before I take your lil drawers off
Dom, this be that shit that you could blog off
And I got a request before you log off

[Hook]
Put it on the screen
Put it on the screen
Put it on the screen
Put it on the screen
What's your name girl, what's your ID
All around the world, you can find me
Put it on the screen
Put it on the screen
Put it on the screen
Put it on the screen
What up up up
What up up up

[Verse 2]
This that verse that I know I murdered
That watermelon sundae yeah I know you heard it
I'm getting better now because I'm so determined
And we be in your hood in like four Suburbans
Chinos and Chuck Taylors, gotta keep it urban
Still all over the map like your phone service
Guess that's the beat talking
IPhone chat baby never cheap talking
Any time zone, I don't get much sleep often
That speaker phone love, I just tell her keep talking
Say "hello Dom,"
I say "yo girl,"
"Are you home yet?"
I say "no girl
Are you tired yet?"
She say "some Dom,"
"Can I stop by?"
She say "come Dom,"
"I'm on my way now,"
She say "run Dom,"
I'm that nigga huh
Number one Dom
What up up up
