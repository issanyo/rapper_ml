[Verse 1]
Hard denim and my same vans
You know I'm still doing my same dance
The one in Bank of America
I used to have this cute brownskinned named Erica
But let me take my time though cause me I don't never rush
Ridin' in them tight spaceships we didn't never push
Coulda got the black five fifty with the leather but
I just thought the AMG was the better look
The 360 deal handshakes I ain't never shook
So it say other people's money in my debit book
If she can't suck dick well then she better cook
I'm trying to find a girl that do both ima tell her look
I'm not gon' buy you flowers, me I'mma smell your bush
Then tie your hands up together, treat you like a crook
Every time we go out she tell me how nice I look
Eating in them spots that don't even put the prices up
These niggas not hype enough!
She rather fuck with the captain
In my hotel wearing satin in midtown Manhattan
Relaxing watching CNN or Sportscenter
Indie but I do it like a fucking award winner

I got on hard denim and my same vans
You know I'm still doing my same dance
Right in Bank of America
I used to have this cute brownskined named Erica...
