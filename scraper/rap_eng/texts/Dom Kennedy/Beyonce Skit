[Verse:]
Yea yea yea LA lakers Dom Kennedy best after barbie too
I asked the most generic question ever bro
Because you know i don't see many collab out there
Outside the homies yep absolutely
But outside the homies if you had to collab with someone
Who would it be man
At this point man honestly i think about it man
I get i get a lot of nerve and prepare
And it's hard for me but i always say at this point Beyonce man
And for real that would be a person i would
Definitely want to work with you know as far as music pair
You know i just say i do songs with the homies
But Beyonce man hollar  at me i would love
To do some music you know what i mean for sure
Ok
