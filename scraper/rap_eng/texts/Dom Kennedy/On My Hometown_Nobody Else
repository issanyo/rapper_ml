Part 1: On My Hometown

[Intro]
What's up? What's up? What's up?

[Hook 1]
Do it like this if you from my hometown
That nigga AD, yeah, he from my hometown
Never got lost, never got found
I was in here the whole time wit' my nigga J. LBS

That nigga Boogie, yeah, he from my hometown
My big homie Lance, yeah, he from my hometown
He was the first one to say Leimert Park on the track
Like, 'Little homie, kick back, let me show you how to get down'

[Verse 1]
And you know how I like to do when I'm off the kush though
Might skip car next year and get a fresh boat
You know, they got spots on the water on the West Coast
Cut off the khakis, made shorts, did the dress code
He could take you around the world, put your name on the map
I could take you out to the beach, let you sit in my lap
If I take you out to eat, it might be a drive-through
Lookin' out my sideview, don't scrape the curb
I just got 'em repainted, damn, that's my word
You want to roll around wit' me and blow lots of herb?

[Hook 2]
It's how we do it in my hometown
You talkin' crazy in them rap songs, you need to slow down
It's on my hometown, it's on my hometown
Yo, that nigga BH, yeah, he from my hometown
Shout-out my nigga Tre, man, he from my hometown

[Verse 2]
Yo, I told her she was pretty, then I got laid
Rep for the city, then I got paid
Went global, had three girls on me like Total
IPhone, got a Gucci case on her Boost Mobile
Fuck your feelings, we tryin' to get these millions
Ain't shit sweet, my cavity need fillin'
Don't catch no feelings nor tract infections
Seen her fat ass in 'em shorts, damn, I had to press it
Lookin' like Jet magazine in this motherfucker
Hope I don't get arrested
For doin' 85, goin' straight up La Brea
Told her, 'Fuck wit' OPM', girl, them niggas is players
For real, we might blow the whole pound
Damn, why y'all let World On Wheels close down

[Hook 3]
Damn, damn, that nigga J Phresh, yeah, he from my hometown
Shout-out to DJ Quest, man, he from my hometown
Yo, you know the homie Mizzle, man, he from my hometown
The homegirl Gizzle, man, she from my hometown, yeah

Part 2: Nobody Else

[Intro]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 1]
Told lil' mama, 'Go to work', you don't even know you blessed
Fell back at Sam's the other night, my vice could've been cigarettes
Met a cute girl the other night, you know, nice ass, nice breasts
Called up to your job twice, I was wit' a girl we met
Had to start takin' my advice
So I don't change nothin' but a cheque
Even though it's B, you're overrated
That's why I keep the Virgin Mary on my neck
Uh, cause I don't trust nothin' else
OPM, besides that I don't fuck wit' nothin' else
I don't trust nothin' else
OPM, besides that I don't fuck wit' nothin' else
I don't trust nothin' else
OPM had my back when I ain't had nobody else
