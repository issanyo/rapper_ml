[Intro]
Yeah
Aye Look

[Verse 1]
Don't play with me baby I ain't the one
Two at the same time and I make them both cum
I spend racks every time Im in the club
Didn't take me long to write this, time to flood
Don't make a song about me, is y'all done?
Show sold out, no deals, Im the one
10 years in write me borrow none
Since 23 all I seen was lump sums
And I got a send a RIP, the one punch
I'll never roll with a nigga I can't trust
Ol boy said he got six figures that ain't much
I spent that on at the lot on my truck
Ask Matt Kemp about me, I don't front
Do it for LA every time I drop a cut
I tell her I'm cool and she still stay in touch
I need a few millions off these next nine months

[Bridge]
Don't play with me baby I ain't the one
Don't play with me baby I ain't the one

[Chorus]
Look, heard they said I fell off Im like "How?"
Archie Davis birthday and Mr. Chow
Malibu fried lobster, couple 'rounds
Don't gossip about me, bitch hold it down

[Verse 2]
Tag team whoop, there it is
I might leave the spot with her best friend
Niggas crew hopping cause they desperate
Im with OPM, Im with OPM
We don't give a fuck about award shows
I might take them home and shoot the porno
From Leimert Park out to Hollygrove
I'm the best rapper that you know

[Chorus]
Look, heard they said I fell off Im like, "How?"
Archie Davis birthday and Mr. Chow
Malibu fried lobster, couple 'rounds
Don't gossip about me, bitch hold it down

[Verse 3]
Don't play with me baby I'm not the one
Look, Like this, look
I might leave the spot with her best friend
Niggas crew hopping cause they desperate
Im with OPM, Im with OPM (I love it when they pretty and nasty)
Don't play with me you better go [?]
Don't play with me you better go [?]
Don't play with me you better go [?]
Don't play with me, no
Don't play with me you better go [?]
Don't play with me you better go [?]
Don't play with me you better go [?]
Don't play

[Outro]
Like I said if you get a shot with me, you bettter do your thang
We out
(remember all that shit, you was saying)
OPM
