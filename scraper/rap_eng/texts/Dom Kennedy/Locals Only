[Intro]
Yeah

[Verse 1]
The very first time I heard Run in them Adidas
I never would have thought one day I'd have a fever
They used to say, "Nah, Dom, he is not no keeper"
And "Yeah them songs cool, but naw he ain't got no heaters"
But then I went home (Shhh) we ain't we ain't got one neither
The gas shut off man I just go to sleep but
These niggas think they good but I really know they suck
And niggas think they hood but I really know they punks
The man with most isn't always in the front
So hit that West Side and we'll give you what you want
A nice black eye that'll go with all them lumps
And I try to stay quiet if it ain't involvin us

[Chorus]
She asked me where I came from, I told her "Where you headed?"
"Back to LA", I said, "Baby what you reppin'?"
I got these ideas and I'm tryna make some records
So when the train stops this time, I'ma catch it
When the train stops this time, I'ma catch it
And when the train stops this time, I'ma catch it
When the train stops this time, I'ma catch it
So when the train stops—

[Verse 2]
The very first time I heard Black Superman
I knew it was okay to just act like who I am
I used to rob stores for a tape I could afford
I want to thank the Lord for the life of 2Pac Shakur
I know living's hard, but you gotta see the light
You never gon' make it if you never roll the dice
Take the first step, that was Doctor King's advice
Goin' no days off I'm gone practice every night
I got so many thoughts and I got so much to write
And that right there is the story of my life
Can't sit and complain, naw I'm tryin to get a name
Help feed the kids and I'm tryin to get a chain
My homeboy Ian was the first one with a Range
We used to play my old shit, now I got mo' shit
Just a little somethin' I can get out on the road with
Or maybe just walk to the store with

[Chorus]
She asked me where I came from, I told her "Where you headed?"
"Back to LA", I said, "Baby what you reppin'?"
I got these ideas and I'm tryna make some records
So when the train stops this time, I'ma catch it
When the train stops this time, I'ma catch it
And when the train stops this time, I'ma catch it
When the train stops this time, I'ma catch it
So when the train stops—
