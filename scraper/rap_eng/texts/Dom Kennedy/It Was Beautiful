Yeah
I just need a minute of your time (just a minute of your time)
Can I please have a minute of your time?
Yeah
Get a minute of your time

Ever since we was 12 I've been wanting you to hold
You never was around when I wanted you to roll
Now I see you once, if I'm lucky couple months
I be with this music and you always coupled up
Duffled up or backpacked, the show must continue
I got a couple beats right now I want to send you
I got a empty heart right now I want to lend you
But love don't buy shit so right now I love this pencil
When the mic I record with, nights I get bored with
So I be tryna write some shit that I can hit the stores with
Spit it a cappella and have a nigga on some floor shit
So you can see me at a Laker game on some floor shit
I wanna explore her, that's some ford shit
These hoes don't pay attention cause they probably can't afford it
Haha
But I told you she was beautiful
I told you she was beautiful
And now it's like 2 and I'm tryna make good
Them promises I made that I was gon get us out the hood
Never come back, probably get us out for good
If this was '94, I’d probably give this out to Suge
Like yeah nigga I'm on, posing like I made it
I had a couple cuts but them niggas wouldn't fade it
So I kept writing, booked time and I laid it
Now I couldn't tell you all the girls that I done laid with
Man I couldn't tell you all the places that I played in
Shit I couldn't tell you all the places that I stayed in
Clothes that you rap about, shit that I stayed in
You niggas get love but that's the shit that I was made in

Well, they told me I was beautiful
I told you I was beautiful
I told you I was beautiful
I told you I was beautiful

Like Stevie on the keys, Isley on the string
Every time I see it, it reminds me of them things
Every time I see you it reminds me of my dreams
Everything is fine, hope I find you when I leave
Just because I style they think I ain't broken
And just because I smile, they be thinking I be jokin
I pass on the blunt and niggas think that I be smokin
Bust my A's hat and people think that I'm from Oakland
But I'm just athletic, just as ready
And when I say you fine I'm talking just aesthetics
Cause it's kinda a façade, you steady goin out
Chest be poking out, when you know you got a job
And you barely got benefits, talking what you finna get
It's all cool now but I want you to remember this
Matter fact don't remember shit
Especially old girl that you caught me out at dinner with
Sin a bit- pray more, thank you for this day Lord
I only answer to you so I shouldn't have to say more
Uh

And I told you life was beautiful
I told you it was beautiful
I told you it was beautiful
I told you it was beautiful
I told you it was beautiful
I told you it was beautiful

As women on the stretch pole
Why we so disrespectful?
Why Jesus resurrect for?
Some things you never get told
How beautiful this sound be
I'm just happy that it found me
Karma comes around, niggas
I'm just glad I'm already down with her
This from my side of town with it
That rest in peace James Brown with it
But I don't wanna get to loud with it
I just hope I make you proud with it

And I told you we was beautiful (J. Skillz)
I told you we was beautiful (Yeah)
I told you we was beautiful
I told you we was beautiful (Look at us now)
I told you we was beautiful
I told you we was beautiful (Haha, second time around)
I told you we was beautiful (Do work)
I told you we was beautiful
