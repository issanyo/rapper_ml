[Chorus]
I need a freak like you
I need a freak in the day time
Freak in the late night, late night, late night
I need a freak on call
I need a freak like you
I need a freak like you
I need a freak in the day time
Freak in the late night, late night, late night
I need a freak on call
I need a freak like you
I need a freak in the day time
Freak in the late night, late night, late night
I need a freak on call
I need a freak like you

[Verse 1]
[?] company for lunch and dinner
Leave them Goyard wallets with nothing in it
Whoever need it first, approach the window
I'm talking all business [?]
I approach woman with complete respect
Turn the iPhone off give your thoughts arrest
Nikes on the box give your self a check
7 figures [?] how you feeling ref
Blow the whistle like [?]
For hating niggas like [?]
Champagne over [?]
Thats on everything OPM going north
I lost money on the last bet
I’m still up, switch the address
Stay veggie with the crab legs
Just be yourself thats what my dad says

[Pre Chorus]
And I must agree on the regular
Living every day thats the schedule
Mixed the 100 proof with the medical
What you doing isn't comparable

[Chorus]
I need a freak in the day time
Freak in the late night, late night, late night
I need a freak on call
I need a freak like you
I need a freak in the day time
Freak in the late night, late night, late night
I need a freak on call
I need a freak like you

[Verse 2]
Passed the goal line and I kneeled down
Waiting on your turn it might be a while
Nice landscape and then she get aroused
Baling hard like Mr. Trout
Gucci flip flips when I kicked her out
It was still [?]
Imma leave the game shook
I don't wanna change teams
[?]
Make the 808 push
[?] money in books
Real players say [?]

[Pre Chorus]
And I must agree on the regular
Living every day thats the schedule
Mixed the 100 proof with the medical
What you doing isn’t comparable

[Chorus]
I need a freak in the day time
Freak in the late night, late night, late night
I need a freak on call
I need a freak like you
I need a freak in the day time
Freak in the late night, late night, late night
I need a freak on call
I need a freak like you
