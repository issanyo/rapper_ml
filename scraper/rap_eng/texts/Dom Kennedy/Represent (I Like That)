[Intro]
Where you at, J Poundz?

[Verse 1]
I had passed on this beat when I first heard it
Now its murdered like the Inc., Irv Gotti never rode a Ducati
And if you pull up on me, do it fast make it sloppy
Told her both my parents black, but you can still call me papi

[Hook]
Ooh, I like that, ooh, I like that
Yeah, I like that, ooh, I like that

[Verse 2]
Ooh, this was always plan A, let me know what you tryin' to be
I'm the one they tryin' to see, give these girls all kind of D
Dope Dom and a Dollar Menu, I'll continue
Sold a thousand walk-up tickets in Diego, switch the venue
Rest in peace Tony Gwynn, I just see the field different
Had to flood the whole bracelet, man, this shit just feel different
My brother Larry told me, 'Yes', he comin' out to rep that West
Made it back to the hotel to wash my face and catch my breath
Another night at Mama Shelter watchin' movies by myself
Or I could go downstairs, find a cutie and get some help
I be saggin' on stage, damn, I should have just wore my belt
Tryin' to put them ice cubes on your leg and make it melt

[Hook]

[Bridge]
Do your thing, girl, go on, represent
Go on, represent, go on, go on represent
Told her, 'Do your thing girl', go on, represent
Go on, go on, represent, go on represent, ooh

[Verse 3]
Her Instagram blocked, it's feelin' like she not it
No matter what kind of car I'm in, I'm lookin' like the top pic
She told me, 'Let's go to the bridge, Dom, I want to watch this'
So I drove to pick her up the other day, she wasn't ready
Walkin' up to her room, only us, not a sound
Wrapped in a green towel, wipin' lotion all around
I used the whole bottle messin' with you, better know it
Lay down, I'll pour it, after that you better throw it

[Hook] (x2)

[Outro]
Go Ares, it's your birthday, all the Libras, it's your birthday
Go Taurus, it's your birthday, all them Cancers, It's your birthday
I said, 'Go Leos, it's your birthday'
All them Scorpios, it's your birthday
Go Pisces, it's your birthday, all them Virgos, it's your birthday
Go Aquarius, it's your birthday, all the Geminis, it's your birthday
Hey, Sagittarius, it's your birthday
All the Capricorn, it's your birthday, ooh
