[Intro]
Yeah, Nip hold your head
Yeah Yeah
All Money In OPM, and that's for sho
Hey, that’s just how it's been, ya know
Still on the come up
So..

[Verse 1]
Rest in peace to that nigga Fats
It's a South Central thang, let you know where we at
Sun Visor low I got the my hat to the back
Sometimes you gotta get it done when off the nest
Another murder in the city got us all stressed
As I look around I wonder which one of us next
Reporters from our city sh-h-h, I’m one of the best
Could of made my momma proud just working at UPS
Fuck that it wouldn't of been enough cash for me
Fuck that I make these women shake that ass for me
Just off of facial recognition they know that I'm tippin'
You ain't with the team right now, keep the distance
We ain't playin' wit you entertainers No (No)
18 Karat on my wedding finger whao (whoa)
OPM rings for my day unos (unos)
She might get fucked if she stands to close (to close)
Lucky number 7 not Toni Kukoc (Kukoc)
OG Kush I don't fuck with pre-rolls (with pre-rolls)
I don’t trust you niggas to roll my shit
Just quit hatin’ on me and get off my dick

[Hook]
Karma is a bitch, trust I know it
She use to give me good head moms never sober
Martini's with the dinner 200 dollar blenders
She thought I wasn’t gonna shit from what I remember
Now I bet she want another chance (chance)
Now I bet she want another chance (chance)
Sometimes you really gotta take a stand (stand)
Have the mic ready for me when I land, Aye

[Verse 2]
It was 1 degree when we hit Minnesota
I just bendin' the rules you keep bendin' over
Leather with the wool-lining think I'm gettin colder
Blonde ponytail just like paloma
Shit is too expensive to be broke (ya’ll broke)
If you run for president baby I'll vote
Look us up OPM in the DOW Jones
If it ain't about that you might get the dial-tone (hello)
Glad to pass on Joey Supreme is now home (home yea)
Fish fryin' hot off the stove yea I'm on (on)
Cold champagne for my nigga yea I'm on (on)
Learned a lot of game just watchin' Sean Combs
Talkin crystals talkin pistals
Shuttin' down clubs pullin' chics out
Hop in sports cars with the big valves (big valves)
2Pac should've had a mistrial
Every single diamond gonna glisten
I ain't sweatin' no competition (tion)
Workin' Pro-Tools like the kitchen
I told her all you gotta do is listen

[Hook]
Karma is a bitch, trust I know her
She use to give me good head moms never sober
Martini's with the dinner 200 dollar blenders
She thought I wasn't gonna shit from what I remember (I remember)
Now I bet she want another chance (chance)
Now I bet she want another chance (chance)
Sometimes you really gotta take a stand (stand)
Just have the mic ready for me when I land (when I land)
Yea, I say I'm back in this bitch
I just happen to rap
And that's lucky for you
I spit actual facts, Aye , Uh-hh

[Outro]
Yea you know, I use to have a fight at school, and I use to have to run home cause they gonna get big brother on me. So uhhh, I start
I start saying (car horn blows) fuck that, I can't be running home. Ya know, cause I get ran home. My momma make me fight! Cause if I lose that fight that means she's gonna whoop my ass. So I had to win. That way I wouldn't get 2 ass whoopins. Cause if I get beat up, my
