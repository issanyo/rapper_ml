If ever we get lost during our time, please don’t forget me
You are free to take a look around but always remember where you come from
By the way, I left a notebook for you by the door
Please write when you can
Peace & Happiness!

[Hook]
Peace & Happiness(x4)

[Verse 1]
I used to wonder when my turn would come
Now I wonder if I’ll ever w quit
I be buying shit I never had
Cuz I was tired of never having shit
And now I’m picking crab with shrimp
And I don’t fuck with no average chicks
We eating $400 meals, tell me what you think I average tip
Don’t get caught up in extravagence
And you can go from rags to rich
Girl I see you got yo Gucci purse
But you looking like a bag of shit
And I don’t gotta ask for shit
I be counting all this cash I get
And shout out to my baby mama
Cuz she be paying half the rent
Sometimes I sit back and just think about (Peace & Happiness)

[Hook 2]
Peace & Happiness(x3)

[Verse 2]
You ttryna get to Heavan much
Niggas can’t eat off of 7 bucks
Bet you always expected us
Who scratched the fucking records up
This girl always tryna sex me up
You better always gotta check for us
Cuz we tryna get this money fast
On Westside Get The Money Ave
The kids wave when I’m coming past
It’s a parade when I’m coming past
I can count a million one in cash
And still I give all I have (x4)
