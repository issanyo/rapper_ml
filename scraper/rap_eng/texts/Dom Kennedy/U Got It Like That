[Intro]
All I wanna do
It's all I wanna do
Be exactly who I am

[Hook]
You say he trippin'? cut him off then
Guy like me don't come around that often
The money the only thing that I really wanna talk with
Ridin' on leather seats, huh, you a boss bitch

[Verse 1]
OPM, I'm the franchise
Some things? money can't buy
She can get it with her hands tied
Won the game by a landslide
350 on the health care
Ask him was he from the Westside, he said "hell yeah"
Tell all my enemies I'm doin' well, yeah
95 in the Porsche with the tail up !
Tryna figure out if I should hit them L's drunk
Skinny lil chick, she ain't missed a meal once
We straight to the house, I'ma get the glass cups
No Bill Cosby, used to go by A plus, uh
Half a Mil say it's my year
My son almost 6, I ain't stopped since he got here
If it's past New Mexico? we can fly there
When you roll with me you gotta hit the joint once
I know it's pretty girls way in Pacoima
That love me to death, her favorite performer
I be in the spot with filets to fork up
And you know we gettin' busy in my room if the door's shut

[Hook]
You say he trippin'? cut him off then
Guy like me don't come around that often
The money the only thing that I really wanna talk with
Ridin' on leather seats, huh, you a boss bitch

[Interlude]
U got it like that
Oh God

[Verse 2: Niko G4]
If she trippin', cut her off then
Bounce back, probably fuck with her best friend
Never talk about money that I can't spend
Only focused on vision and progression
All the losses that I took taught me lessons
Gotta be thankful for all my blessings (thank God)
Niggas coppin' whips, fuck what the cost is
Lil' bitch, let me show you what a boss is
VVS, yeah they so fuckin' flawless
A young G, ho I'm so fuckin' lawless
..'Cause I really came from nothin'
...And you ain't really sayin' nothin'
And they just talkin', fuck assumptions
I'm never trickin' but I smash 'em like a pumpkin
OPM, they show love when we walked in
In the club, pop the bub, blow the sparkie

[Hook]
You say he trippin' cut him off then
Guy like me don't come around that often
The money the only thing that I really wanna talk with
Ridin' on leather seats, huh, you a boss bitch

[Outro]
U Got it like that
Oh God
U Got it like that
