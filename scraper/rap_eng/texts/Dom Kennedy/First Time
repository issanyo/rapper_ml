[Verse 1: Dom Kennedy]
Bathin’ Ape sweatsuit Cartier glasses
I wish I walked around (?)
Can’t even take a day off it’s so intense
You know feeling when you riding paper temps
How dare you looking like you ain’t convinced
When it’s fall bet we still rake it in
It’s no room you can’t have this much paper in
This niggas ghetto as fuck and still can’t swim
I touch water so clear
I was already a player
Just made me more aware
Diamonds I share
My son is my heir
He gone be wealthy as fuck
He gone be healthy as fuck
Gucci polo for picture day uh huh
She just can’t wait for February to come
Black Chanel box with the bow to match
Somewhere along the way we got so attached

[Chorus: Dom Kennedy] 2x
Guess you could say you'se the one I trusted
Who would ever think that you would spread like mustard?
When shit got hot

[Verse 2: Dom Kennedy]
Oh now y’all want to talk black businesses
Come to LA get your apprenticeship
On Crenshaw Bob had his liquor store
Sydney Lyons say nah just give them more
Don’t never quit the game if you love it
You might never get the see through AP flooded
All them nights spent with hoes got repercussions
But when you 80 dawg who you gone end up with
I might just hit it out the park like Justin
Game 2, paid dues
I remember rocking songs for the first time
Taking off her thong for the first time
I need everybody to stand like at church time
NYC skyline off the turnpike
And LA sunsets with you by my side

[Chorus: Dom Kennedy]
You know
Guess you could say you'se the one I trusted
And who would ever think that you would spread like mustard?
When shit got hot

[Outro: Lionel Richie (Dom Kennedy)]
I wish the world were truly happy (when I wake up in the morning)
Living as one
I wish the word they call freedom someday would come
Someday would come

Lionel Richie never lied
Lionel Richie never lied
Lionel Richie never lied
