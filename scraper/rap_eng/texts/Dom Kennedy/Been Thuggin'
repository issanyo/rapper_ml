[Verse 1]
I'm in the game to win somethin'
She didn't wanna roll with me until she seen her friend comin'
Bought the BMW, you know I got the Benz comin'
Broke niggas always in the club but never spend nothin'
These broke hoes always talking 'bout you should spend somethin'
Got my first kiss in '89, yea I been thuggin'
Tryna write a song everyday cause the rent comin'
Kids see my car and they think it's 50 Cent comin'

[Hook]
Leimert Park nigga, never runnin' cause we been thuggin'
West side niggas never runnin' cause we been thuggin'
East side niggas never runnin' cause we been thuggin'
West side niggas never runnin' cause we been thuggin'

[Verse 2]
Ay, park my car up in the front and keep the shit runnin'
I fuck with you nigga, 100, we can get blunted
Me and my nigga Nip Hussle in the 600
How you gon' win if you never wanna risk nothin'
Get up off yo ass lil' nigga gon' get somethin'
I'm in the dice game, all bets, tryna hit somethin'
These hoes walk around in the club tryna kiss him
Not right now damn can't you see I'm with somethin'
Don't ever mess with sloppy hoes cause you can get somethin'
Niggas up early in the morning tryna get somethin'
If you put in on this weed then you can hit somethin'
Leimert Park nigga, never runnin' cause we been thuggin'

[Hook]
West side niggas never runnin' cause we been thuggin'
East side niggas never runnin' cause we been thuggin'
West side niggas never runnin' cause we been thuggin'
East side niggas never runnin' cause we been thuggin'

[Outro]
We been thuggin'
Been thuggin'
Been thuggin'
Been thuggin'
