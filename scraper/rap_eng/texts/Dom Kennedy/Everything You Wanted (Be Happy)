[Verse 1]

So I been lookin' for this female
So I had to get that email
We went further into detail
She pulled up in the CL
I'm in that 650 though
I'd told her "look, come get me though"
You might can't be my main girl
But you can smoke somethin' with me though
These might not be your first drugs
I might not be your first love
That's Chanel in your purse huh?
Oh you need a ride to work huh?
Them little shorts with the booty out
Oh it's lookin' like a movie
Oh I think she wanna do me now
We did it big in the jacuzzi BOW!
That's how it sounded when it skeeted out
And then she asked if I could eat it out
I'm the nigga of the year baby
Fuck who you've been reading 'bout
No disrespect to any nigga
But I ain't in debt to any nigga
I'll fly a jet into any nigga
I know you niggas hear me nigga!

[Hook]

Be happy, get your money yeah
You're doin' shows, fuckin' honeys yeah
In videos countin' hundreds yeah
Ain't this everything you wanted? yeah (x4)

[Verse 2]

Shit, I just realized
I don't ever use clear eyes
I'm always on my chill vibe
They wanna see me on my kill side
Shit I been on four wheel drive
I went on tour in 09
You still tourin' in '012
You still fuckin' in motels
Niggas crawlin' on my coattails
If you get caught I'm posting no bail
Empty the clip until it's no shells
I wanna say what's up to Rochelle
And linin' up like it's coat sales
And she don't like the way the smoke smells
You on fire nigga, no hell
It's our secret baby, don't tell
Don't worry be happy, yeah
You're almost thirty be happy, yeah
You can't hurt me be happy, yeah
You hoes thirsty get at me, yeah

[Hook]

Be happy, get your money yeah
You're doin' shows, fuckin' honeys yeah
In videos countin' hundreds yeah
And you got everything you wanted yeah
