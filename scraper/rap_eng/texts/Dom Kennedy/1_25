[Intro]
Its 1:25 baby and guess what we up doing
Get money then you die my nigga
Ain't really that much to it
A lot of people have big plans
I’m just the one that stuck to it
A nigga tryna drive what Baby driving
Shit, I’m tryna do what Puffy doing
I feel like the guy in Crush Groove
My whole life is like Crush Groove

[Verse 1]
How things been since I left?
I know these niggas now have very little respect
That’s why I came back to get you up out that dress
And that was kinda direct but what else would you expect
You can buy cars, big condos and jets
Handguns and tecs, you’ll never get no respect
She walks in the room kisses me on the neck
Sits down on the couch like I’m tryna have sex
Two months later her stomach it feels upset
Took a pregnancy test shook her head and was yes
Never meant to happen hoping it turns for the best
Whatever the outcome I’m always gone have regrets
I am not Jody you are not no Yvette
‘Fore charges get pressed I’ma go head and step
If you getting money niggas gotta connect
And I never smoke stress or wanna fuck w my ex

[Hook]
It’s 1:25 baby (x4)

[Verse 2]
Excuse my language but I done been through some shit
One thing I knew is I never was finna quit
Build a foundation it take time to get rich
Instead of can tuna Ima fuck with this shrimp
Get a nice car hit it off with some tint
And every time I see my girl I hit her off with some rent
I talk to the kids hit em off with some sense
Don’t talk to police you might get somebody pinched
Never give a inch life can go in a flinch
Don’t say you got a gun when niggas know it’s a wrench
Hanging out with me feels like an event
And I hit it one time she said, “Yea, I’m convinced”
I know it’s getting late but I ain't feeling content
So I’ma pick this lock till I hear it go click
Tryna get my chips and stay away from you simps
If you happy being you I fuck with you on the strength

[Hook]
It’s 1:25 baby (x4)

[Outro]
You know, just living the way I was always meant to
Ain't no coincidence, you work hard, you get what you deserve then you die
The rest is up to you and how you spend it is up to you
Tomorrow ain't promised for none of us
That’s why we pop champagne today!
