[Intro]
Fuck a role model
My advice (mental health)
You want my advice?

[Verse 1]
Just have fun, live life
Get married, throw some rice if you want to
Get through a book by Sun Tzu
I'm back with a brand new agenda
Carbon fiber trim, matte black, five percenter
Florentine Gardens parking lot
We smoking, drinking, watch out for the cops
Them Portuguese youngins, them shits was hot
Damn, CG used to hold me down the lot
Fuck a role model
The white house full of criminals
So I tell 'em make sure you get the gentiles
Gave you little niggas plenty styles
Not playing for another city just to stick around
Might lay the verse one time then hit the loud
L.A. not for sale, letting off shells, spitting acapellas
Supreme Vans in the mail

[Bridge]
Yo, forreal
Do not live your life based off money and what you don't have because it don't exists
It's an illusion that's driving this world crazy

[Verse 2]
Will we be happy?
Yes is the answer
Find it in your heart to give back (like Candace)
Vodka and [?] at the tavern
Every time she don't get her way, another tantrum
Babyface, it look like she was eleven with curls
Felt it in her heart 'cause my message is thorough
Came in thuggin', we ain't no referrals
When it's all done, man we raising the [?]
And go all the way to lover's lane
Find a spot, we don't gotta tuck the blades
[?]
Fiend birds holding hands like mayonnaise
Damn, so catch me I'm the man
These days, I'm truly my biggest fan
Galaxies far away can see me
I can't pretend like my temperature ain't just raise
