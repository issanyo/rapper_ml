[Intro: Smoke DZA]
Yeah, you know
A lot of niggas make music for a certain demographic
I make music for my niggas, and niggas like me
No figure, no funk
Cinematic, look

[Verse 1: Smoke DZA]
What up, haters? You forever be anonymous
Forever popping shit, my ears ringing
Them bullshit tunes and things that they singing
‘Bout the hustle and the struggle that they ain’t been in
You seen it from the window sill, you was playing
Nintendo still, we was the niggas in those fields
With ya McLovin gaffe, you niggas can’t fool me
I sold bud, sold raps, working on movies
Young Warhol giving you game
Tryna get more than 15 minutes of fame
Nigga, I’m one of the nicest, you suffering
With identity crisis, nigga, you don’t even know you
Fuck a nigga owe you? I’m Goku, Mr. Miyagi
Sonny from Bronx Tale, or the nigga that gave Leroy his blow
I mean, I taught you everything that you know
Lil ungrateful lil bastard, tryna outshine the master
Closed casket, cremation
Had to Marvin Gaye my kids that ain’t behaving
Niggas is doo-doo, shit’ll get crucial
Fuck nigga, who you? I did this to you, DZA

[Interlude: Dom Kennedy]
‘Sup, nigga? Yeah

[Verse 2: Dom Kennedy]
Dark shades with the two Cs
Skate highs with the blue jeans
Got 1000 in my pocket, tryna take it up to two Gs
I buy tees with my loose cheese
The low tops with the two Gs, if not them then the 2-3s
Shit I’m probably somewhere right now eating steak
But if I ain’t, it’s a two-piece
Could make a million in like two weeks (yeah), uh
I’m on my grind like brakes
I ain’t tryna grind til I’m eight-
Zero, I’m looking like that Negro
Cops pull me over for being a Black
But I’m the type of nigga to TiVo the Nat Geo
I’m in New York, so "What up?" to the Fat G-O
If a nigga say I ain’t got bitches, it mean he don’t
If a nigga say he ever gon’ kill me, it mean he won’t
If a girl say she love me forever, it mean she won’t
You can’t name places you go, and nigga, we don’t
Yeah, I’ma tell it like this
LA in like one and NY in like six
They call me DOPEITSDOM ‘cause I’m frying like, uh
Why buy that when you can buy it like this?
Baby, I can put you at the top of my list
You never had love 'til you try it like this
How you gon’ run from a feeling like this?
Have you ever seen stars from a building like this?
