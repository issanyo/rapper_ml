[Pre-Hook]
Gon' pour this wine in your memory
Yeah, can I smoke this one for Phillip, please?
They say my nigga gone, but I think they lyin', I feel his energy

[Hook]
When I'm gone, just remember me
When I'm gone, just remember me
When I'm gone, just remember me

[Verse 1]
When I'm gone, gon' fill your glass up wit' Hennessy
This might be the last time you see a G
Might go get me a bodyguard
I might smoke the whole ninety yards
And leave the rest at your gravesite
So I never get stage fright
Wit' all these people comin' out for me
Forgive my words and you look out for me
And on the way home, I, I drove by my old school
I rolled me a tight joint, then popped me a cold boo

[Pre-Hook]

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
When I'm gone, I might just retire and move to Alhambra
Fuck my old lady 'til I need to use Viagra
Big nice cars, they'll make you drive faster
In the long run, what does it really matter?
So let that Remy be your remedy
Find a girl half-Philippine, the other half straight nigga
She got ass, then I ain't trippin'
She could be a white girl
Her momma have doubts in me
Her daughter's always at my show
Forget my words and she look out for me
Ha, and on the way home, I, we stopped off at Santa Cruz
I made me some new friends, then popped me a cold boo

[Pre-Hook]

[Outro]
I might just retire and move to Alhambra
Fuck my old lady, tell her I need to use Viagra
Big nice cars, they'll help you drive faster
But in the long run, what does it really matter? Uh
