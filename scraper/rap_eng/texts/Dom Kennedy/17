[Intro: Dom Kennedy]
Back when I was 17
Back when I was 17
Back when I was 17
Yeah...
Check

[Verse 1: Dom Kennedy]
Back when I was 17, I had a notion
That I would see the whole world across the ocean
My dad be workin' hard but he get no promotion
And he there every day, shit that's devotion
I never had a chance to be in the U.S. Open
I used to collect cans for them U.S. tokens
It's that time of the month? girl, we use that lotion
Before the president was black, shit I wasn't votin'
I used to believe a dollar bill was all I needed
Why you keep lookin' in the mirror if you not conceited?
Don't pack them Air Jordans, boy you not gone need em
On Burnside with my niggas, and them tacos screamin'

[Hook]
If I told you what I saw, you would not believe it
If I showed you how I ball, you would not believe it
If I told you what I make, you would not believe it
Look how niggas did Ma$e, I cannot believe it

[Verse 2: Dom Kennedy]
I had the Craig Mack tape with that one single
Lotta niggas back then had one single
Tell her pop that ass trick and I'mma drop some singles
And real niggas fuck with Jodeci, not The Beatles
Lotta women in my phone, cause I'm ridin' chrome
West Side till I'm gone, Ima die alone
Never runnin' out of strong, I might buy a zone
Have her comin' home blown, smell like my cologne
Who you talkin' to nigga?, better watch yo tone
She used to call me every day, 'til you blocked my phone
I used to dream one day that I would shop in Rome
That ain't the life for me nigga, the block is home
Now I'm back with my people and I'm never leavin'
Don't do it for yo' self kid, it's better reasons
It get lonely at the top and its hella freezin'
I was here in '92 when it all fell to pieces

[Hook]
If I told you what I saw, you would not believe it
If I showed you how I ball, you would not believe it
If I told you what I make, you would not believe it
Shit we used to dub tapes, I cannot believe it

I cannot believe it
I cannot believe it
I cannot believe it
I cannot believe it

[Outro: Female Radio Host]
Latest news off the street. The OPM Boys made it to first
But the inside word is the odds have stacked against them
Be careful out there boys, real careful
