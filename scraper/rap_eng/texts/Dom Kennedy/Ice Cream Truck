Yeah.. uh huh, lil something for the..yeah

[Verse 1]
On my way to Hollywood, im taking a short
If its girls in here man I'm taking em all
Can't wait to tell her mom that she dating a star
That first Biggie Smalls album stay in my car
Got some competition but they say I'm in charge
She can see the watch when I sway the cigar
I dont need luck I'm just playing my cards
I put the lotion on her while she lay in the yard
It look like you had a long day at the job
I made that jerk chicken with the corn on the cob
Body so right you got a hell of a mom
I gotta give it up she did a hell of a job
My man put me on he just through me a line
I like that you ain't got a pic of you on your blog
Ipod on while you walking the dog
Playing Salt N Pepa, TLC, Nicki Minaj
And I don't search that much but I had to pay attention
Cause you worth that much
I bought you the Chanel lil purse slash clutch
I made 40 gs and we burnt that up

[Hook]
Barbeque for the whole sqaud, house party right down the street
Sip champagne all day, Ice cream truck all week (x2)

[Verse 2]
I wanna mellow out, cold beer, cigarello out
School never was for me, went the ghetto route
Now im big in New York, Carmelo house
Can't wait to turn Coachella out
I just want paper and some property
Girls is on top of me, Im boardwalking its Monopoly
Yeah, Garlic prawns with the broccoli
Uh make sure you spell my name properly
This is all capitals, doing anything for them capitals
Dont have my check on time and we after you
Anything I say I do it's all actual, I get money shit is factual
I be in the library reading recipes for thai curries
In the studio talking on the phone with my attorneys
This is life, I got a lil something to smoke, make a plate
And then take something to go, oh

[Hook]
Barbeque for the whole sqaud, house party right down the street
Sip champagne all day, Ice cream truck all week (x2)

Make sure the drinks don't stop, just make sure the drinks don't stop (x5)

[Hook]
Barbeque for the whole sqaud, house party right down the street
Sip champagne all day, Ice cream truck all week (x2)
