[Intro]
You can find me on Cree, polo on my tee
And even when I’m gone, my logo on the street
What that tell ya?
What that tell ya?
What that tell ya?
What that tell ya?
It’s what they tell me

[Verse]
They say 25th is a classic
Future Street was on the radio and mastered
I miss Mike S. call, but he called back
I still book my own shows, you should applaud that, yeah
On the road to the money and we started renting vans doing shows across the country
I met Ricky Ross and I think that nigga dug me
So shout out to Nick Diamond cause I think that nigga plugged me
Went to ATL where the women was looking lovely
And LA got bitches, so you know it’s hard to judge ‘em
Gold diggers are a high, so you know it’s hard to trust ‘em
And yeah them hoes be on, but nigga it ain’t hard to fuck one
Take it from a nigga that done touch one
Same girl that them niggas wanna cuff, huh
Jay Fresh will tell them hoes, “Lets puff one”
If I ain’t got no bottles, shit, we finna pick up one
All designer clothes with the chucks, huh
Jay 305, nigga, we don’t give a fuck, huh
Where these niggas going with these dunks on
And any nigga in the way is getting dunked on
So show the tape, then show his face
I woke up and wrote this, so you know it’s fate
If he say he don’t feel it then you know it’s hate
The biggest thing shining in this muthafukin’ golden state

[Outro]
Find me on Cree, polo on my tee
And even when I’m gone, my logo on the street
What that tell ya?
What that tell ya?
What that tell ya?
What that tell ya?
It’s what they tell me on Cree, polo on my tee
And even when I’m gone, my logo on the street
What that tell ya? (Dom good)
What that tell ya? (Dom good)
What that tell ya? (Dom good)
What that tell ya? (Dom good)
It’s what they tell me, uh
