[Verse 1: Lady of Rage]
I never played, so before first grade I skipped the playpen
Pen game was flame before I learned to tie my laces
Rage is where the plague is, no containing
Sick with the spit that I spit, I inflict contagion
Inhale the ether
They can't breathe easy when I'm around
I leave them a Lil' Weezy like the son of Cita
Ha, I'm Chiquita, bananas
Y'all monkeys wouldn't bust grapes
Ahh, I roll with gorillas, for real-a, my nigga, bandits
Planet of the Apes
Rise, all hail Queen Kong
Peons that becoming soft enough to stuff them out your ding-dongs
Ah, I'm in it to win it 'til I become
The hottest chick to run the third rock from the Sun
Lyrically, you would be a fool to fight
With the Robin Givens I'm spitting shit on two of the mics
Yikes, I'm goin' in like a lifer
Step into your radius and decipher your cypher

[Verse 2: Blind Fury]
Let me try it
This the Big Payback, stupid
Get lost, I'm a big boss like Rick Ross's Maybach Music
I make cats lose it
When they realize they part of the reason I'm starting to sleep on rap music
I'm AJ with the style, cause I go free
Now everybody and they mama want to know me
I'm on that OG, feeling like I'm suppose'ta
Came to ruin it, and I'm doin' it 'til it's over
It's gon' take a little bit more than this to move me
I'm on BET more than the Biggie movie
Ain't looking for no girlfriend, just a clique of groupies
Call me Wiz, cause tonight I'm tryna get the chewy
I love New York, but out of town's sweeter
I cheated on Irene 'soon as I found Keisha
So, 'nuff respect to alla crew in all d'area
Right 'ere on the street is where we-a bury ya
Boom

[Verse 3: Dom Kennedy]
Even though I can't see me
I know I look good right now on your TV
Throw my shades on, call me young Stevie
Leimert Park legend, we just make it look easy
And I'm counting my money, everyday sunny
I earned my spot, you ain't taking that from me
Tell them fine girls start shaking that for me
West Side get the money, start making that for me
It's the unfadeable
Who the best is debateable
But I do it with no label though
Yea, I said we going all night wit' it
Prolly ain't seen this since Suge Knight did it
Girl you look good, tell her get right wit' it
I can't do a show in your city if the price isn't
When I walk in, I can tell that they feeling me
I hear the girls say that's Dom Kennedy

[Verse 4: Skillz]
If you a rapper from Virginia, meeting me should give you the chills
I'm the reason that the world expects you to have some skills
Y'all better call Rozay, dude
Cause this verse gone need like nine uhh's and twenty-two whoo's
I ain't kidding around
You got BET in HD? Well you might want to hit that now
Cause I'm never home, I stay gone
Y'all was everywhere, now you never there, payphones
Clutch fast, spit mustard gas
And when haters say my name, it sounds like crushed glass
They students, I crushed the class
Plus, y'all never came in like Jay-Z's mustache
Top me? Don't be crazy, chump
Unless one of these guys decide to show a baby bump
Shout Mr. Hill and Ms. Lee
Oh, and the award for who destroyed the cypher?
That goes to me
