[Verse 1: J. Cole]
Below that Mason Dixon my residence
Dirty South Confederate
Ay we should hold election's I say Bun B for President
He represent them Real Niggas
TX to ATL to NC yea them Ville Niggas
Them Trill niggas chill nigga this that rider shit
My bottom bitch say "I'm not a bitch boy I got a bitch"
I keep her ass in Prada shit
These rappers counterfeit
I potty train niggas yea this that "teach you how to" shit
I'm 'bout to shit my minds the Glock my mouth's the clip
My words is bullets I'm 'bout to spit
I'll leave you leakin you lay in pieces
As if the streets a couch and shit
You see me on my bouncin shit
Watch how I put you out this shit
Man I'm makin so much money gotta pay somebody to count this shit
Probably gonna make my accountant sick
Boy I'm higher than a mountain's get
These new niggas ain't talkin bout nothin
Cause it's obvious they ain't been around this shit
So they bound to split
When they go down, profound with these pronouns
Ladies lovin J. Cole now
So you better not bring yo ho round

[Hook]

You know the residence
Dirty South Confederate
Ay we should hold election's I say Bun B for President
He represent them Real Niggas
TX to ATL to NC yea them Ville Niggas
Them Trill niggas

[Verse 2: Dom Kennedy]
You know I represent, West Side Checkin in
If we gone hold elections I say Bun B for President
He represent them Ville niggas
That get yo money up without no record nigga
That's real nigga, Hey
Make this left, we gone take it out West
I hope niggas don't really mind
I was just payin my respects
"The Game Belongs To Me" is what I be bangin out my deck
And I can understand why niggas sayin Dom is next
Let's talk about now though
I'm still the new nigga these new niggas look out for
"Well Damn Joe" that's what Chicago niggas greet me with
These niggas really not eatin
Watch who you see me with
Wait till a nigga blow up, watch who you peep me with
I only want her for tonight man you can keep this bitch
Peep this shit I got my 20's
Got my 50's I got my hundreds I got my 1's
A new night, a new city
I did my show I gotta run
To the kids of America and all these fucking slums
If you want to be King then I suggest you vote for Bun
A real nigga know, when a real nigga's done
If you want to be a King then I suggest you vote for Bun
Like that
