[Hook: Polyester] (2x)
Hanging at the park after dark with the homies
Laced up Chucks, gold chain rollie
Hop over the fence, ain't no tripping cuz they know me
This is what it's like when you graduate to OG

[Verse 1: Dom Kennedy]
Time keep moving like a record spinning
Step up out the house and I'm representing
I don't just live here, shit, I represent it
That Westside got your girlfriend catching feelings
Don't ask about my last name, it's presidential
You can't talk about a street that you ain't never been to
You always yapping bout them girls you ain't never been through
She call my phone crying, I give her more than tissue
A chance to make a million off these instrumentals
And I deserve the whole thing, look at what we been through
If it was over today, I ain't got no issues
I'll be right back in Leimert to keep it funky with you

[Verse 2: Dom Kennedy]
You better off dead than chilling with the feds
You tell on somebody here, they gone cut yo head
Ask me for advice niggas, don't be dumb and scared
The school of hard knocks, don't be unprepared
Soon as you hit junior high, it feel like no one cares
Opportunity might knock, but it'll be no one there
Them boys waiting at the park, but don't you go in there
Them gang injunctions hitting niggas with over 40 years
SWV show, these niggas throwing chairs
That's the type of shit I seen out here
A helicopter every night, can't dream out here
Damn, it feel good to say I did my thing out here, I be

[Verse 3: Dom Kennedy]
I learned the whole game from the ones that lived it
I was around black men who was running businesses
Making something out of nothing, shit we all physicists
And they tried to buy me out, but we wasn't interested
Y'all do something good and it's so interesting
We do something better and niggas gone mention it
It really don't matter cuz y'all got no benjamins
Remember back in 98, you was so feminine
Now it's a rag in yo pocket, nigga who you mimicking
You gotta pay yo dues first, no dividends
No matter if it's Chucks or some old Timberlands
Sometimes I close my eyes and I start remembering
