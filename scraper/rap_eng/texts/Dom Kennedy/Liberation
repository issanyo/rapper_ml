[Intro]
She’s falling under my spell
She’s falling
She’s falling under my spell
She’s falling
She’s falling under my spell
She’s falling
She’s falling under my spell
She’s falling

[Verse 1]
Even if the steak’s still Outback
Don’t ever question ya man
I’ll put you out on both legs
In between [?]
I know exactly how to play it
Make enough for the both of us, I’m just saying
And the sweater is Champion, like Ambien
Somehow I beat the averages
Pretty toes, cute face, shine like my prezzy
If looks could kill, I’d be dead already
You know

[Hook (4x)]
She think I only want her ‘cause she fine
But to me that girl is official

[Verse 2]
Imperial Highway to the restaurant
On your wedding day what type of dress you want?
If it’s in the stars like Orion’s Belt
On my bad days could you make patty melts?
You done heard the story from everybody else
I’m the real source for the vibes you want
See all these niggas tryna size you up
Just wishing that they could spend time with her
Guess I’m too complex for the front of the Fader
With all due respect, I made too much paper
To ever give a fuck what you feel ‘bout me
On our first date I wore black cement 3s

[Hook (2x)]
She think I only want her ‘cause she fine
But to me that girl is official

[Outro]
She’s falling under my spell
She’s falling
She’s falling under my spell
She’s falling
