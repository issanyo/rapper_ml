[Verse 1: Dom Kennedy]
Now that
We have come together on this soundtrack
Been looking for my heart? Yeah, I found that
From the west side, where I lay down at
I got my sound back
And I'm solar
I shine better when the day is over
Let me take you to a place colder
And you could put my jacket on your shoulder
Just let me know, huh
Is that right, huh?
You ain't gon' give in, you gotta fight, huh?
You just can't do it all in one night, huh?
You gotta make me think you all nice, huh?
(Yeah, that's right)
Well, I can't hate that
It would be an honor just to date that
Somewhere out of town where a lake at
A little Al Green on that 8-track
Let's go way back

[Chorus: Dom Kennedy]
I say, "What's up, girl?'
She say, "What's up?" right back
I say, "What up, girl"
She say, "What's up?" right back
I say, "What's up, girl?'
She say, "What's up?" right back
I say, "What up, girl"
She say, "What's up?" right back
You like my style, huh? (I never thought about it)
You want me now, huh? (Nope, I never thought about it)
We having kids, huh? (I never thought about it)
Yes, you did, huh? (Nope, I never thought about it)

[Verse 2: brandUn DeShay]
Yo, on some real shit
You looking like the type I wanna chill with
You wondering why I'm rapping on some chill shit
But really, I'm just rapping on my Dom shit
I'm off my mind and shit
Tell me what else is new, trying to get in your head like some Selsun Blue
And where you going? 'Cause I need to be going, too
You try to shut me down twice, now I'm 0-and-2
And I ain't one to lose except my mind over you
Great tits, amazing face, and got crazy legs
You dance in circles around my game like Crazy Legs
I got a soft spot for you like a baby head
And you made me red in the face like a white guy
I ain't the toughest nigga, but look on the bright side
If you win the R&B this year, I'm your right guy
I don't sing much, but you need to have me on your team, girl
I'll be batting clean up

[Chorus: Dom Kennedy]
I say, "What's up, girl?'
She say, "What's up?" right back
I say, "What up, girl"
She say, "What's up?" right back
I say, "What's up, girl?'
She say, "What's up?" right back
I say, "What up, girl"
She say, "What's up?" right back
You like my style, huh? (I never thought about it)
You want me now, huh? (Nope, I never thought about it)
We having kids, huh? (I never thought about it)
Yes, you did, huh? (Nope, I never thought about it)

[Verse 3: Dom Kennedy]
Then we
Take a little ride in the Bentley
Nah, I'm just playing, that's my friend's Jeep
But I'm gon' get me one off of this beat
Let's make history
I write my own book
And a skit and a verse and my own hook
'Til we doing more numbers than a phone book
I'm cool on trends, I got my own look
It's called the "OWN" look
Did you catch that?
I'm coming out Leimert, I gotta rep that
Same place you need to get your rest at
I'm just being real, you can expect that
(Yeah, I respect that)
But you don't smile much
I just want a chance to correct that
Your heart is on your sleeve, can I protect that?
I will 1-800 call collect that
You gotta accept that

[Chorus: Dom Kennedy]
I say, "What's up, girl?'
She say, "What's up?" right back
I say, "What up, girl"
She say, "What's up?" right back
I say, "What's up, girl?'
She say, "What's up?" right back
I say, "What up, girl"
She say, "What's up?" right back
You like my style, huh? (I never thought about it)
You want me now, huh? (Nope, I never thought about it)
We having kids, huh? (I never thought about it)
Yes, you did, huh? (Nope, I never thought about it)
I say, "What's up, girl?'
She say, "What's up?" right back
I say, "What up, girl"
She say, "What's up?" right back
I say, "What's up, girl?'
She say, "What's up?" right back
I say, "What up, girl"
She say, "What's up?" right back
You like my style, huh? (I never thought about it)
You want me now, huh? (Nope, I never thought about it)
We having kids, huh? (I never thought about it)
Yes, you did, huh? (Nope, I never thought about it)
