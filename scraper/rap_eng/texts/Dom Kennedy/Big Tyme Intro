[Verse 1: Dom Kennedy & Hit-Boy]
Anything I smoke, at least 260
I can see from here she wanna move with me
I just told the dealer to remove the ceiling
230 on the dash, finna pop a wheelie
Met you in [?] when we stopped in Philly
33 Purple Rd., niggas got to feel me
Docked off in the sweet off the wine and whisky
[?] top floor, I got two with me
Yeah, I'm someone you can invest in
So go tell all your best friends
So they can fuck my best friends
Me and Dom plottin' on them twin DB11's
Fast break, James Harden, switchin' to my left hand, like

[Refrain: Dom Kennedy]
Might go get the, four
Might go get the, coupe
Gucci on my, shoes
I'm gon' let her, choose
Might go get the, rack
Might go get the, coupe
Gucci on my...
Gucci on my...

[Verse 2: Hit-Boy & Dom Kennedy]
Pray your hands for the ones that flipped on me
Half-A-Mil sweaters for the members only
Young nigga ganged up, like I'ma tripple OG
Oyster perpetual Rollies
Pray your hands for the ones that skipped on me
End A&Rs trying to piss on me
I got some calories on my wrist, homie
All we do is big time shit
They start controversy up, and I still come up sturdy
Can't show no mercy, nigga I'm three much for thirty
We got it poppin' soon as we checked in
No games being played, nothin' to talk about
[?] your bitch, might have to walk her out
Say she wanna [?] me at the Waffle House
Plays off the trap line, don't even caught the house
Bought three packs, they was all out

[Refrain: Dom Kennedy]
Might go get the, four
Might go get the, coupe
Gucci on my, shoes
I'm gon' let her, choose
Might go get the...
Might go get the...
Gucci on my...
Gucci on my...
