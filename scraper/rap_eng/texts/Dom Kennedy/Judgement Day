[Dom Kennedy: Verse 1]

I told her this a little tale about a nigga driving big wheels
At the video shoot its looking like tip drill
Chill or be killed is the motto cause this shit real
To be a millionaire, I wondered how that shit feel
At the swap meet but we still spending big bills
Watchout for the pot hole nigga cause it gets ill
Other people's money yeah we are eating scrimp still
Independent nigga I just seen a house for ten mil'
Damn this girl just left her number on my windshield
Took her to the Dodger game, let her touch the infield
I ain't gotta call her everyday and we friends still
Just text a nigga when you tryin' get yo' limbs peeled
Don't just think a nigga rap cause I been real
I don't give a fuck if yo nigga had ten deals
He still can't buy a Lamborghini, he's a weenie
Tell him stay in his place before I get him erased
What's his face [What's his face]
You know he rap with what's his face, they really stink up the place
It's too fucking late, these niggas trying to be me, it's too fucking late
Im too fucking great, turn up the bass
Let me show you little niggas how to run a race
I told'em I could beat you if I was running late
I know some girls with tattoos that say come and play so I come and play
And OPM til it's over and another day
And thats what I'll tell the Lord on judgement day (2x), on judgement day
And I wanna wish my people eternal grace
If not here maybe in a new time and place
I sip beer while I listen to "Find A Way"
Tryin' to find a way, and OPM til it's over and another day
Im with my son girl call me another day, and thats what I'll tell the Lord on judgement day
On judgement day, On judgement day
