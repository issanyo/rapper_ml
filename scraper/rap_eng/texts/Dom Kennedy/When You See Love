[Hook x3]
Her smile reminds me of a warm summer breeze
Like that playground with steez
Write our the name in the trees

Her smile reminds me of a warm summer breeze
Like that time on the beach
Feeling that sand through your feet

[Verse 1]
Comin live from never never land
We out in Jamaica getting hella tan
Adidas track pants on and wedding bands
When you see love just go get it fam
She half super woman but she down to earth
It's about who have it last not who found it first
Them tears on her pillow is the sound of hurt
Any time you want to build I be down to work
Just call my number up
Got to keep in touch
Just tell me if there someone else
We got to keep the trust
You always focused on us girl just keep it up
And I'mma take you roller skating before the week is up
I'm always on the road so we don't speak enough
I was told skys the limit so I'm reaching up
Them glow in her eyes just eat me up
Turn them speakers up

[Hook x2]
Her smile reminds me of a warm summer breeze
Like that playground with steez
Right in the name in the trees

Her smile reminds me of a warm summer breeze
Like that time on the beach
And that sand through your feet

[Verse 2]
Its a lot of late nights filled with contemplation
I could read your body language like a conversation
If we never talk again was your time wasted
I'm in a league of my own Tom Hanks
Good people going great places
It don't happen overnight
Shit it take patience
Nothing is the same
Life stay changing
As I put my head down and I say graces

[Outro]
Warm summer breeze
Playground and steez
Right in the name in the trees
Smile reminds me of a warm summer breeze
Time on the beach
Sand through your feet
