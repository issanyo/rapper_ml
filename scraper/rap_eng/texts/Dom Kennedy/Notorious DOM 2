[Verse]
Niggas, bet they grabbed a seat
Imma a let y’all sing while I keep shit street
Survivin’ South Central ain’t never been sweet
Now I’d rather go see a judge before I lay six feet
Young nigga from Leimert guaranteed to stay down
Used to kill niggas with [?] on playgrounds
Now I’m out of town bound
Catch me on the [?]
225 tryin’ to set me up a waiter
Wait up, tell Reese I want to date her
Girl name Janae, her pops tried to run for mayor
Stomach so flat, other bitches say they hate her
And she get weed for free and like to blow it out in Vegas
(What else?)
A home girl named Mikasha
Player so close the troop thinks you want to taste it
And get money wide from a nigga off the paces
And fuck with Benz driving ass niggas from Jamaica
(Wait up)
So you know I tried to break her
But what did you expect muthafuka I’m [?]
At the Rose Bowl tryin’ to watch the Trojans beat the Gators
And they hate us so loud, but never want to fade us
Who yo top five, niggas never wanna say us
“Ya, Dom cool”, but niggas never wanna say much
Keep ya mouth close, pussy nigga, and just pay up
You trying to recoup that, watch how I stay up
Miami John Stockton style, watch how I lay up
[?] I’m just trying to spend a [?]
You saying, “take that”
I’m saying, “take what?”
You saying, “sign here”
I’m saying, “make what?”
Living just like Vince Vaughn did, Breakup
I run my own job, bitch, so I ain’t got to wake up
I’m out, I’m in, I’m out, I’m in
We gotta get this money cause this money gon’ spend
If you really get money then your money don’t bend
Gotta keep this shit moving
All money, no friends and I’m out

[Outro]
Uh, Chanel Platinum and all that, uh
Kicks matching and all that, yeah
To all my Hennessy sippers
And my champagne spillers
Get you a bag of something special
And make sure them hoes roll your joints tight, ight
