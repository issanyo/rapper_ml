[Verse 1: Smoke DZA]
Know it's nice out, when the bikes out
80 dollar bets, so bring the dice out
Feds snatched Black, he be right out
Jerk salmon and mac and cheese from Lighthouse
You niggas do what you're told, I do me 'cuz I'm bold
I maneuver in Ubers, Keep a Lincoln on hold
OG by the O, shit my mans and 'dem grow
On the low he blend in think he regular joe
He the plug
Pump so much bass I need another sub
Ask to many questions he might be the fuzz
No love trying to play me
Hold a grudge like a new born baby, beloved
Imma be here nigga so hate it or love it
Always pulla couple strings
Hide behind the web that's a sucka thing
Reality strike and it was just a dream
Dusk 2 dusk

[Chorus: TheMIND]
Street lights and strawberry skies
Dirt on my hands, sun in my eyes
I wake up from a day dream singing lullabies
Am I the black sheep or the star on the moonless night
Cast me out or wish upon me
I just pray the sun will make it right in the morning

[Verse 2: Big K.R.I.T.]
This sound like Champagne and Henny, last train to Paris
Every day's a day off, working wheels like a Ferris
Bueller, cooler than a fan in the church house, I
Couldn't sweat that bullshit they pressing up (smoking)
Even if I worked out
So now it's steak and shrimp on my meal plan
And I'm talking foreign cars [?] a nigga wheels slam
On unexpected haters
It's about that cheese you got when they grate you
Cause niggas get shredded everyday tryna make it to the majors
I'm just on my own two, Multi till my bone blue
I'm worldwide with this movement like where your flight done flown you?
Passport stamped up, Dutch got me amped up
Could feel it's a sure shot like Kevin Durant with a camera
And that's word to [?]
Got the key to my city in a week and think I'ma buy a float
And parade up and down that shit but those the things I do the most
But that's just how shit go
Everybody ain't gon' love you for your trinkets and trunk hose
'cause it's dusk to dusk

[Chorus: TheMIND]
Street lights and strawberry skies
Dirt on my hands, sun in my eyes
I wake up from a day dream singing lullabies
Am I the black sheep or the star on the moonless night
Cast me out or wish upon me
I just pray the sun will make it right in the morning

[Verse 3: Dom Kennedy]
I'm like ya can't be serious
Only time I get no pussy she on her period, oh
Keep it real you wanna be like me
Shopping spree for my dad, might get a bulldog a lab
Four whips in the driveway
Let's see what I'ma have
I want the chicken sauce and the ribs please
In the [?] breeze
D-O-M-I-N-I-C, that's me
Buy her ass some sandals and she sucks dick for free
It's a shame how girls do anything for a look
It's a shame how rappers do anythings for the glow
Talk about places we lived a long time ago
But it's in me for life and if you feel my light
You get to send me on site but you broke
So I just continue my dreams
And keep shopping those BMs
I feel 56 thousand people's screams
They got blood boiling like I'm a fiend
She got tight as a keyhole and I'm always erect
The Westside of LA, man the party the best
So from Christmas to Christmas Eve
I'm lighting up all my trees
Killing all my songs, got money in all my jeans
Girls on all my screens, relationships over flings
Barbecue wings, ballin' within my means
And everybody's down to sacrifice for the team
Peace, happiness and a lil red and green and that's it

[Chorus: TheMIND]
Street lights and strawberry skies
Dirt on my hands, sun in my eyes
I wake up from a day dream singing lullabies
Am I the black sheep or the star on the moonless night
Cast me out or wish upon me
I just pray the sun will make it right in the morning
