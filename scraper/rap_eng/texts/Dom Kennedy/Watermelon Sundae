HEY!
You must got a fever, to hot to have a man
Girl you must gotta leave him (HEY!)
I keep it up like a tree (UM)
Palms on 7th AVe that be lining up the street uh (HEY!)
Her hips grindin to the beat
It's your birthday and Im just trying to get a piece, Go (HEY!)
I fell victim to your waist
The cherry's on top you can lick it get a taste, Say (HEY!)
We can kick it any day
Ain't gotta share flavors we can kick it anyway say, Uh (HEY!)

[Chorus]
Life ain't sweet, Saturday through Monday
But in the summer time you my Watermelon Sundae
Life ain't sweet, Saturday through Monday
But in the summer time you my Watermelon Sundae

But in the summer time you my Watermelon Sundae
Gotta beat the heat, even though I wanna play
But you keep me cool you my Watermelon Sundae

HEY!
You taste so cool
In your crispy clean crew yea we make those too, I say (HEY!)
You rock Jay's so smooth
If you wasn't into me I'll prolly date yo shoes, I said (HEY!)
You can replace most dudes
But when you stand next to me don't melt away so soon, I said (HEY!)
We can play games no rules
Fat french fries with the steak au jus, I said (HEY!)
Throw a shake on too
Put ya legs over here I bet I shake those too, I said (HEY!)
You can't escape what's real
Fuck grown old I wanna make love here, I said (HEY!)
We might breakup yea
The sun will go down and we'll make up there, I said (HEY!)
You like a missile and it blows
Try and get away but I just kiss you on the nose, say(HEY!)

But in the summer time you my Watermelon Sundae
Gotta beat the heat, even though I wanna play

[Verse 3: Jason Madison]
Seven years ago to today, I met her
She had long hair and I had a bad sweater
Two years and several months ago I kissed her
Then I met her moms and her little sister
And she met mine and we kept tryin
But I kept lyin and she kept cryin
A river in the ocean waves of commotion
She said too much emotion without no devotion
Love potion number nine was her screen name
It was a mean game tryin to keep my thing tamed
She seemed sane but we all go a little nuts
She used to grab the tab but now I pick it up
Pick it up pack it in let me begin
I never pretend to commit a few sins
And since she's committed we had to did it again
I grabbed the Juice and she sipped the Gin
Some men never did what I had done
But my excuse is that we was having a little fun
And funny I remember daily taking her to work
And Watermelon Sundae was her favorite dessert, because

[Chorus]
Life ain't sweet, Saturday through Monday
But in the summer time you my Watermelon Sundae
Life ain't sweet, Saturday through Monday
But in the summer time you my Watermelon Sundae
Life ain't sweet, Saturday through Monday
But in the summer time you my Watermelon Sundae
Gotta beat the heat, even though I wanna play
But you keep me cool you my Watermelon Sundae

[Outro]
Life ain't Sweet
Go Head!
Go Head!
You my Watermelon Sundae
Go Head!
Saturday through Monday
Go Head!
You my Watermelon Sundae
Go Head!
Go Head!
And then I found you (repeat fade out of the song)

[Bridge]
Go Head! UH!
Go Head! UH!
Go Head! UH!
Go Head! UH!
Go Head! UH!
Go Head! UH!
Go Head! UH!
Go Head! UH!
Go Head! UH!
Go Head! UH AH UH!
