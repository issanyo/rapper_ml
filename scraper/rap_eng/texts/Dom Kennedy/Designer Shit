I'm only gonna do this one time
Tailor made...
Uh. Im talkin about everything tailor made
Yeah...Yeah
Check

On a road trip to Vegas
And that's 14 carrots
So them gold diggers crave it
Put it in a pipe just like them old niggas blazin
"We finna get this money bitch," I told niggas daily
Anything can happen shit I showed niggas daily
I never met a girl in my life that wouldn't date me
True Story, My jeans cost about 240
I fucked 2 shorties in a house that's 2 stories
I can't wear regular shit, it's too boring
So when she see a nigga like me she come join
This designer shit, got a "O" of marijuana
By the China shit, that Dom I wanna meet yo momma shit
No hooks, you know we all about that rhymin shit
Cash Money, Independent, Big Tymer shit
I said, "Girl, I know you know you know you fine and shit
But Goddamn, Why can't I just make you mine and shit?
Why you always actin like you blind and shit?
I know you love the way that we be grindin it
But I don't like them niggas you be ridin with
And them the one's you always end up signin with
Don't ask me when you see me who I'm signin with
Who ever got the most money is who I'm vibin with
Fuck that, who the fuck I'm even jivin with
I'm already inner scope, ain't no hidin it
I just want a Maybach to recline in it
No, I wanna lay back and take my time with it
If you gettin cheese say "one time" with it
And if you on yo knees take yo time with it
I might Kangol and Gold Tooth it
Man I told yall these hoes stupid
I wouldn't fuck no bitch named "Stacks"
And real niggas make shit on wax
Fuckin Fruity Loops
All yo shit so whack, cause real niggas make shit on DAT's
You fuckin rappers
You niggas couldn't hit on bats
You ain't shit nigga sit on that
It's like a cashmere sweater
A million upfront will make a bad year better
Birds ain't flyin off last years feathers
And I ain't eatin off last years cheddar
Ain't no sunshine just ask Bill Withers
Two Hundred twenties make my pockets feel better
Know we got girl friends and they still let us

This that Designer Shit... This that Designer shit (Yeah)
And all them hoes stay in line for this (Uh)
