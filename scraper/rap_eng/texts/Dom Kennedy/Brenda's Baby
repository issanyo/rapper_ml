[Intro]
How tall are you? For real? No that's perfect
My real name is Dominic, That means belonging to the lord
So you gotta take care of me
Im special

[Verse 1]
She don't got that much cleavage
From the valley probably went to Cleveland
From the city probably went to Jeff
Came through and did her best
All the ballers throwing loot at her
All the rappers tryna shoot at her
When she around she don't talk much
6 700 hundred for the mall run
To south coast with her best friend
Caught my song on the XM
I think we passed by the exit
You was lost till you met him
All bones where we left as
Make you happy, what im best at
Im ball under chest pass, paul on the step back
Get that girl a press pass

[Bridge]
She grown now
She grown now
She grown now

I don't care what day it is
Going hard is the narrative
You only live once gotta cherish it
Revenge taste good imma cherish this
STD check its imperative
Shout out to my jones out in Maryland
Crab cakes on me when we back again
She love my LA accent
For us to meet it was destined
Her mom name is in question
Ill say it was Brenda, although I really don't remember
But now her baby girls a stripper
And her bf hits her
Still they label her a bad bitch
Can't be living in the past tense

[Bridge]
She grown now
She grown now
She grown now

[Outro]
Well it was good seeing you again
I think we gone be back in a couple months though, shit
Well anyway you got my, you got my email
You know what im saying
So just hit me , you know if you ever in LA or something
