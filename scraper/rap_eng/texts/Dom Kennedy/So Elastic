[Verse 1]
I'm just exploring
I walk up to the fine girls, say what you doing
Girl, you tryna get with me I like yo taste
I like yo shoes, I like yo shirt, I like yo waist
Let me see what you got in that safe
Uhh, yea, I said I talk to girls who talk to girls
I think I ran across ya girl
I think ya man just lost his girl
Shit I think we been across the world
The money's what we running after
And what you think is coming after
Shit, I heard yo girl say she want a rapper
Man that shit was so dumb, I slapped her
A real nigga and he want his master's
I get girls cause I'm so attractive
I can't fuck if it's no attachment
A night with you could be so relaxing
And you ain't never had thug passion
Girl, you ain't never had thug passion
A night with you could be so relaxing
I love yo ass because you so elastic
And you ain't never had thug passion
Girl, you ain't never had thug passion
A night with you could be so relaxing
I lo' yo ass because you so elastic

[Bridge]
If that's who you want to be with
Then baby so be it
Never held your heart
'til you had the freedom to leave or stay
I was never in the way
But sometimes you want it
And you want me to step
Try so hard to fix it, baby

[Verse 2]
I went from eating cheesy macaroni to Peppone
Told her gon' drop it down for me like you owe me
When you see me don't be all on me, you don't know me
You gon' be a star one day, that's what my uncle told me
So I'm tryna make it happen, damn how I end up rappin'
Yea, started making money when we dropped that Legal Trappin'
We be going hard for seven days like Toni Braxton
And she ask me do I love her, nah I just want some satisfaction
Uh tell me what you do when the streets is all you
Pull up to the club a hundred deep this our crew
I just want all the fine girls to fall through
Like I’ll take her, her, her, her her, and y’all too
It’s true that most west side niggas wear blue
But I done just kicked it right there on Piru
Fucking niggas say man we all about this loot
West side get the money nigga this ain’t no fucking group
Blue, red and green is the colors I salute
Blue, red and green is the colors I salute
Blue, red and green is the colors I salute
West side get the money nigga this ain’t no fucking group
