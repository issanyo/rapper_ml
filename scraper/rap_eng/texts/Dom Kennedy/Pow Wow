[Verse 1: Smoke DZA]
What the lick read them small timers be big league
Entertaining the bullshit too risky
Fifty dollar half a mint, mixed breed
Bitch please go plankin', six feet
Bout to teach everybody a lesson
Think they got all the answers til you switch up the questions
Fuck the guidelines new age baby boomer
Rules don't abide by not I
Not even trynna me and my little mama
Somewhere on a beach on Porta [?] smokin' sour
Livin' life
Funk the resort up nothin' but load
The holdin' their nose prolly think the skunk is around
You know the kid got the meanest raw, cleanest bar
Got Ralph Lauren pieces never seen before
Nigga closet way iller than yours
Rugby game like Richie McCaw

[Hook]
Live like like a Rolling Stone
Passport got no room for stamps
Everywhere we go they know my name you messin' with some real life made men
Uh, self made bosses
Want something done and they say when
That's why you could never be able
To pow wow with us at the head of the table

[Verse 2: Dom Kennedy]
From where I'm sittin' I can't see ya'll
I'm in this golf shirt bout to tee off
This rap shit is like gettin' weed off
And I ain't buy these shades at no kiosk
If money is the goal I'm the inkeeper
And I ain't start rappin' to make friends either
They let us in the game now they stuck with us
It's hard to find somebody that don't fuck with us
You know we got a little bucks with us
Fans feeling like they grew up with us
Shit, I'm on my first of the month business
She got stretched just to eat a little lunch with us
Yeah, I got the prime rib veggie plate
She hit me with the Dom you know I'm ready face
I got my napkin in my low shirt
Just let me finish my Merlot first

[Hook]
