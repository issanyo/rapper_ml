Oh baby
Ooh baby
Oh baby
You're driving me crazy
Oh baby
Ooh baby
Oh baby
You're driving me-

[Verse 1]
My LA show, it had sold well
I went home, no hotels
Phone's off, voicemails
No side hoes, just my homegirl
I be fucking up, calling old girls
We at Supperclub, they popping Spades
In Lamborghinis, still coppin' J's
Still smokin' weed, still rockin' chains
I'm in my Vans, I'm in my stance
I see her look, then do a dance
She see the man, I see the van
I can't go to sleep, I leave for France
Then fly to London, like Peter Pan
You don't need a drink, girl you need a man
Girl you need a plan

And when I talk, she ate it up
That's what I thought
Out of all girls, the ones I want
Stay at home, be at Starbucks
Out of all girls, the ones I want
At least 22, so don't card us
Out of all girls, the ones I want
If I couldn't rap, on the job hunt
Out of all girls, the ones I want
All the girls, that's what I want

[Hook]
Oh baby
Ooh baby
Oh baby
You're driving me crazy (crazy)

[Verse 2]
The DC show, it goes well
We on the bus, no hotel
With some fine hoes, don't tell
If you see my girl, don't tell
I love New Orleans, I'm sad when I'm leaving
I fuck with Ohio, It's ladies in Cleveland
Let's go to Detroit, let's shop for some pieces
Let's make it a weekend, get a place at the Seasons
Then wake up in Dallas, I'm checking my balance
Running these laps, eating these salads
Understanding my talent, gaining my balance
Looking for homes, to make it my palace
The best is my average

And when I talk, she ate it up
That's what I thought
Out of all girls, the ones I want
If I couldn't rap, on the job hunt
Out of all girls, the ones I want
Love rap, especially God's Son
Out of all girls, the ones I want
All the girls, that's what I want

[Hook]
Oh baby
Ooh baby
Oh baby
You're driving me crazy (crazy)

Uh, yeah, yeah, uh
Yeah, yeah, yeah, uh
Yeah, yeah, yeah, uh
Yeah, yeah, yeah, uh
Uh, yeah
Uh, yeah
Yeah, uh
