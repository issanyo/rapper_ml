[Intro: Hit-Boy]
Yeah
Drinks still out
Niggas don't even understand
For real, yeah

[Chorus]
Niggas like to speak outside your house
That's why I'm not inviting niggas to the crib as much
I could tell they'd rather see my ribs touch
Then to see me eat, uh, shit is deep

[Verse 1: Hit-Boy]
Keep your integrity intact, HB still fuckin' with the tracks
They try and pull me down, bucket full of crabs
You snapchattin', I got a pocket full of snaps, uh
Bitch back up, never made no backup plans, uh
Fuck what you thought, double check, try again
Yeah, even if she still leave with a kiss
Can't trust a bitch again, long as I live, uh

[Chorus: Hit-Boy]
Niggas like to speak outside your house
That's why I'm not inviting niggas to the crib as much
I could tell they'd rather see my ribs touch
Then to see me eat, uh, shit is deep

[Verse 2: Hit-Boy]
Before I get fucked over I get on [?]
Raekwon, by the bonfire, did it for the C.R.E.A.M
Couple thousand beats they ain't for the cheap
Bitch come off when I beat, time to hit the streets
Yeah, HS87 that's my squad
Reppin' that until he punch the clock
Ain't fallin' for the ooh-wop, that's on god, uh
Bangin' photoshoot by guwop, try and plot, um yeah
Free my brother Chilly Chill from the mob
Yeah the surf club shit inside my heart
Since the bubble eyed Lex I went hard
To the niggas that wen't left send my regards, uh

[Chorus]
Niggas like to speak outside your house
That's why I'm not inviting niggas to the crib as much
I could tell they'd rather see my ribs touch

[Verse 3: Dom Kennedy]
So, I like to smile at all my opps
Whisper: "you can get your shit pop"
Wake up with my logo on my socks
Crazy girls, yeah, might blowin' up
LJ in the cut, weed in my lungs
Shoes brand new, came for the ones
I heard she wanna charge me for a hit and run
All out of fucks, I don't give 'em none
Bitch, back up, never had no back up plans
Half-A-Mil, but you don't stand half-a-chance
Niggas still biting Dapper Dan
Runnin' through Phoenix like I'm Nash
Parked the truck up and do the [?]
Them MVP trophies, time to get me one
It's funny seeing phony niggas clicking up
[?] through life just [?] drugs
Hardwood floors, real fur rugs
Mickey Burns ain't got nothin' on me
Let them niggas talk outside your house
Stussy throw blankets on my couch
I couldn't even tell it was a drought
I ain't really trippin', we got an influx
[?] on 33rd, I'm picking ribs up
Heard the big engine when we slipped up
Chanel bag seats, feelin' real plush

[Chorus: Hit-Boy]
Niggas like to speak outside your house
That's why I'm not inviting niggas to the crib as much
I could tell they'd rather see my ribs touch
Then to see me eat, uh, shit is deep

[Outro: Big Hit]
Homie, homie, that's what it, do my nigga
You know what I'm sayin', calling from the pen, my nigga
These crackers are shipping out of state, my nigga
You know what I'm sayin', without my consent
That's how they do everyday [?], you know what I'm sayin'
Everything is on contract, not the shit y'all [?] don't know
You know what I'm sayin', while y'all niggas out there thinkin' y'all bosses, nigga, you fucking with the real boss, boss of all bosses, nigga, Big Hit, bitch, you know what I'm sayin', Hit-Boy, bitch, nigga, [?] bitch, you know what I'm talkin' bout, [?], bitch ass niggas, you know what I'm sayin', niggas never run up with your motherfuckin' mouth, nigga
That part!
