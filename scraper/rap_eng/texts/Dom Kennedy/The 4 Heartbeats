[Intro]
Yeah we back on WTWR radio
This is DJ Cream
We got a new hot track from Dom Kennedy
And Overdoz, we throwin' it at cha
Whatchu gone do wit it?

[Verse 1]
The first time I met her
I knew she'd take my heart from me
The first time I let her
The type that lay you down
And try to carve it out your sweater
And she came form out of town
I say the farther out the better
LA a big city but errbody know me
So say that you my homie
Or else things could get trickier
I call my ex chick chillin with my ex girl
I say my next girl is finna be my best girl
So let's toast to the girls in the front (Ayeee!)
And let's smoke with the girls in the back (Ahhh!)
You know they say them opposites attract
So me and Overdoz is goin' all over the map

[Hook]
You tempt me girl
I'll tempt you back (You're tempting me)
Can't lie baby you're tempting me
If you kiss me then I'll kiss you back (You're tempting me)
Can't lie baby you're tempting me
Gotta do what I gotta do (You're tempting me)
Can't lie baby you're tempting me
You're tempting girl
I'll tempt you back (You're tempting me)
Can't lie baby you're tempting me

[Bridge]
I just wanna go on a date in peace
And there's so many beautiful girls in the world
You can't blame me for taking
A look at you
What would you do
If you were in my shoes
They're only tempting baby
Girl I got you

[Verse 2]
Darling I'm tryna be persistent
Plottin from a distance
But when I do pursue girl
All you do is keep resisting
But every time the plot thickin you're chicken
I'll probably never be able to get cha
So my motto fuck bitches, get it
See y'all love the way my rhymes give your minds orgasms
But I'm tryna make a couple mo to make mo at it
Increasing my own status
But leave it in the past
Cause we on to bigger things
That you imagine, never had in this life

[Hook]
You tempt me girl
I'll tempt you back (You're tempting me)
Can't lie baby you're tempting me
If you kiss me then I'll kiss you back (You're tempting me)
Can't lie baby you're tempting me
Gotta do what I gotta do (You're tempting me)
Can't lie baby you're tempting me
You're tempting girl
I'll tempt you back (You're tempting me)
Can't lie baby you're tempting me

[Verse 3]
Yeah, I said a party finna break out
Some bottles of Merlot and a bag full of take out
We can move it to the back room for the make out
Them knots in your back and whatever else you wanna shake out
Uhh, girl stop playin' wit me
I know my songs the only reason why you layin wit me
The way the whole building get to swaying with me
Sign on my door sayin "No you not stayin wit me"
So knock twice if you tryin get right (Ayeee!)
Knock again if you brought your lil friend (Ahhh!)
What I want I let you fill it in
There's two minutes left and I'm goin for the win
Dom!

[Hook]
You tempt me girl
I'll tempt you back (You're tempting me)
Can't lie baby you're tempting me
If you kiss me then I'll kiss you back (You're tempting me)
Can't lie baby you're tempting me
Gotta do what I gotta do (You're tempting me)
Can't lie baby you're tempting me
You're tempting girl
