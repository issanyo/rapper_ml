[Verse 1:]

The guys always cryin' on twitter ain't my niggas
I be with the ones that's gon' really let em fly wit'cha
Westside OPM from now till the sky hit us
This Don Julio and kush got me in my zone

It's time to pay the mortgage
The flow is bout to change up
So I don't really give my number out
Cause then these hoes like to change up

Range up, all because it was good you couldn't pull out?
Most the girls i know that be rockin' golds in they mouth
They ain't even from the south, she know i could go there
You know what i mean we ain't even gotta leave the house

I fuck her the best, in n out, over sonic
Any day without a doubt
I'm like Richard Sherman
In the fuckin' field, jumpin' routes

Hear niggas making noise
So I'm seeing what its bout
I got J. LBS, he doing the whole thing on it
If it's good to you baby
You could put the whole team on it
Take the camera out, let me shoot a couple scenes on it
If you that bitch

[Chorus:]

That's that shit I'm talking 'bout
That's that shit I'm talking 'bout (Check you out)
That's that shit I'm talking 'bout
That's that shit I'm talking 'bout (Cameras rolling)

[Verse 2:]

The guys always crying on twitter ain't my niggas
Asking these hoes about me don't be dry snitching
She be actin funny when she see me
I wanna take her for tortellini have sex that's all steamy

Like a million dollar Hollywood script
You been at blockbuster this whole time tryna' rent
Classics that ain't got shit on how we live now
But they don't celebrate you when you comin' down

They just give you that look, then appraise yo shit
Like that's that twin turbo, I know you paid a grip
Nothing counterfeit, every line you could quote
I could roll stock Forgiatos or spokes 'round this mothafucker

[Chorus:]

(You know)
That's that shit I'm talking 'bout
That's that shit I'm talking 'bout
That's that shit I'm talking 'bout
That's that shit I'm talking 'bout

That's that shit I'm talking 'bout
That's that shit I'm talking 'bout
(You know)

That's that shit I'm talking 'bout
That's that shit

[Outro:]

I said this for all the pretty ass girls that's in this club, for
(all the pretty ass girls that's in this club)
This for, all the pretty ass girls that's in this club, this for
(all the pretty ass girls that's in this club) x3
