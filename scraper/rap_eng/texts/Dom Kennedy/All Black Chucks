Hook:
Do it side ways
Smack it, smack it, smack it in the air
Brand new weave
I can't pull your weave
All black chucks
These ain't nothing rare
Send me your location
Baby and I'm there


Verse one:
I fuck her like the first time even now
Lets see who gon end up grieving now
My dad always told me things will even out
I never even dreamed I would have
A mothafuckin seventy five flat
Four racks, no tags
If you tryna book me
Way over seas call max
Seven twice, seven twice
So much weed I fell asleep
Woke up wrote a check
20 freestyles a week
I'm the man you wanna keep
Good things they never cheap
That's why we don't shop together
Steak all in my teeth
Real niggas never beef
Got some for everybody
That's why I'm never deep
All my girls are really freaks
Let me slide up underneath
The neighbors called here yesterday
Say they hear you across the street
You need to let her off the leash
Performing on venice beach
The rolex is 10 atleast
Tell her come make the leak
Mothafucker
Yeah, fucker


Hook:
Do it side ways
Smack it, smack it, smack it in the air
Brand new weave
I can't pull your weave
All black chucks
These ain't nothing rare
Send me your location
Baby and I'm there
