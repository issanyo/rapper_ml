[Verse 1]
I'm driving down the boulevard of broken dreams, tryna get my money up
Making sure my momma's straight, tryna leave my son enough
I know the Lord protecting me, but I don't keep my gun enough
They used to look down on me, don't look now I'm coming up
I used to wanna run with her, now them hoes is runnin' up
You live on Crenshaw huh? That just make you one of us
I don't need a lot of beats, I just make sure one enough
The Westside is back again when niggas thought we done enough
I rep that David Blake cause you'll forever be a legend
O'shea gon' be the first, so I'll forever be the second
"Who rep Leimert Park?" is something you ain't gotta question
They like Dom grown up, better than we expected

[Hook]
You can sit up on my shoulders I'll always hold you down
I done been from here across from here across the water, but I still rep my town
Nigga I'm still me, nigga I'm still me, nigga I'm still me, nigga I'm still me
And I vow to never play you, promise that I'll make you proud
Nigga I'm still me

[Verse 1]
I'm still the most reliable, still the most waited on
Still the most looked over, still the most hated on
Power 106, without a manager, I made it on
Still seeing girls in your video I dated on
It's still who rollin' with me, still got the same
Still eat at Earl's grill, still got the same whip
Still drinkin' Hennessey, still got the same bitch
Still got the '22, still got the same
Still love hip-hop, still got the same gift
And every time I see her, I swear I get the same kiss
Still play that old Nas still play that old Kris'
Still play that same Jay still got that same lisp
Still sell my own shit still got the same flip
Still my own boss too still got the same split
Still fuck with Cartier, still got the same clique
Still playing every night, still got the same wish
Still sit and reminisce, still got the same flicks
Still think about Alex, still miss my nigga Nick
Still ain't a millionaire, still never save enough
Still got my fitted on, still never gave a fuck
Still know my old shit, still wasn't played enough
Still gon' give it back to all the kids when I'm payed enough
I give my James Yancey on the raise it up
Welcome to the future though y'all niggas late enough

[Hook]
