[Hook]
When I first saw you
I didn't know what to say
I didn't know what to do
Tryna find my way

[Verse 1]
Girl, I'm all on you
I might even be late
But my love is the truth
I cannot be replaced
So let's do what we want
The day might come we can't
I'm always here for you
I can't forget the place

[Hook]
When I first saw you
I didn't know what to say
I didn't know what to do
Tryna find my way

[Verse 2]
I wrote this song for you
I hope it finds your taste
I know it's overdue
Just hope it ain't too late
So let's stay up all night
The day might come we can't
I'm always here for you
I won't forget your face

[Hook]
When I first saw you
I didn't know what to say
I didn't know what to do
Tryna find my way

[Outro]
I didn't know what to do
I didn't know what to say
When I first saw you
Just tryna find my way
