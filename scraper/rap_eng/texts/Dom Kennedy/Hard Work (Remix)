[Dom Kennedy verse]
It go, I used to want the town, now it's on my back
I'm comin' out Leimert, now it's on the map
Money on my mind, hundreds on my cap
Before Jay said it homie we was all black
You was on this, we was on that
And I bet it's lookin' good even when it never matched
Chillin' on the corner, bet I'll never scratch
Motivational speaker, bet I'll never rap
Tell 'em it's a million, tell 'em that it's double
South Central coming, tell 'em that it's trouble
Niggas gettin' hit, some niggas finna fumble
I don't care about Padiham boy, you niggas gettin' crumbles
Spoken out of love, I did this on the humble
I love to smell the flowers that they growin' out in Humboldt
Roll me up a plane and tell 'em when we land
That this the remix in case you didn't understand
And we tell 'em like

[Hook]
9 to 5, bury that 'cause I'm a dope runner
Ballin' like an athlete, but got no jumpers
9 to 5, bury that 'cause I'm a dope runner
Ballin' like an athlete, but got no jumpers

[Rich Boy verse]
Baby, you a cutie pie, never had this kind of guy
First class seats is the only way I know how to fly
Brand new hard denim lease with the iMax
Wanna do a bid just sign right here on the contract
Women catch a contact, sativa's got 'em feelin' fevers
Baby open up your legs, come be the wide receiver
Pretty women chillin', why the record's spinnin'
We standin' on top of the building like a sniper killin'
I'm at the bank, double-checkin' different deposits
It's fed time if they see what's in my closet
I'm moppin' out in designer frames with two chains
Shout out the player Polow Da Don and Young James

[Hook]

[Slim Thug verse]
I used to dream of ridin' Bentleys, now I'm an owner
Came along way from pushin' rocks on the corner
Used to rock braids but the waves more broner
Ten chains on and ain't nan one a loaner
A sixteen'll cost you 'bout the same as a brick
Still get it independant, I ain't gotta sign shit
6'6 tall pops think I play ball
'Cause I'm spendin' like the pros when I go up in the mall
Keep a bad bitch like she my I.D
Kush in my blood like I got a I.V
I smoke and poke dimes like it's a hobbie
I'm stayin' at the W meet me in the lobby
Better hide your chick when you see Slim Thee
'Cause I'm obitual committin' hoe robbery
'95, Avmax, ex-dope runner
I ball like LeBron but I ain't got no jumper

[Hook]
