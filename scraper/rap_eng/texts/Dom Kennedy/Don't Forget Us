[Hook: Dom Kennedy]
I’m just sitting 'round here smoking weed with my niggas
I just hope when we gone that they don’t forget us (x2)

[Verse 1: Nipsey Hussle]
Look
We just sitting here tryna win
Pull up to the spot, it’s a flock of Benz
So much smoke need oxygen,
Re-up money, that’s not to spend
All gold bottles at Toxic and
Standing on the couch, me and my accomplices
Pop a bottle, spot the bitch; get the bitch, got the bitch
Streets wanna know 'when you droppin' Nip?'
Police wanna know how you got your Six?
Niggas on the side hate to watch the shit
See you on top, so they throw rocks and shit
Never really was with the talking shit
Me, I just went and got a pot to piss
Upgrade diamonds on my watch and shit
Pictures on the wall at the offices
AC colder than my Compton bitch
Talking that “You don’t even need a condom” shit
Look, I’m really on some baller shit
On some rich nigga, I ain't gotta call you shit
On some, fuck with me if you loyal shit
Everybody in my circle get spoiled shit
Really started in the soil shit
Crowns on the wrist, that’s royal shit

[Verse 2: Nipsey Hussle]
Look
We just sitting here tryna win
Drop 20 bands, you can fly us in
Turned down deals, they gon' try again
We need a partnership, it ain't no signing him
You don’t see the type of cars we in?
You don’t see the shows and the lines for them?
You don’t know the spots we residing in
Nigga we straight with dough ain't no enticing him
Look at my life my friend, I got the right to win
I put the grinding in
Even on them nights when the lights was dim
When my hope was low, I found light within
I know it’s ups and downs
So every loss I took, I knew to strike again
And I be saying a lot, that’s a priceless gem
And if we living in hell, is it alright to sin?
I had a goal to chase, a life to live
I tried to wash my hands, pulled me right back in
