[Verse 1: Dom Kennedy]
I don't need no calls today
I don't want no company
I just checked my messages
That bitch just broke up with me
This not what it's supposed to be
Sexed you just the other night
I can't let your panties go
We gone still be homies right?

[Hook x2: Dom Kennedy]
Saw you just the other day
Seen you just the other night
I can't let your panties go
We can still be homies right?

[Verse 2: Dom Kennedy]
This our anniversary
But I don't have to take you out
Show up with my other hoes
I ain't got to fake you out
Hit the store all by myself
I ain't got to drape you out
You putting taps all on my phone
Why you trying to stake me out?
I know I ain't perfect but
I ain't who you make me out
I had your love on lock last year
Now you say you breaking out
But I do love Miami girls
Maybe I should take it south
And spend my nights on Ocean Drive
Buying drinks and making out

[Hook x2: Dom Kennedy]
Saw you just the other day
Seen you just the other night
I can't let your panties go
We can still be homies right?

[Verse 3: Dom Kennedy]
Champagne game
Girl you make me wanna sang
Look into me eyes
Say Versace on the frame
Got me in the car
And you got me on the train
Southern California baby
Where it never rain
Hot cheetos, now and laters and ice cream
Hot Sake, Cortez and dice game
I'm not saying I'm a do the wife thing
I just want to do the right thing (right thing)
Thats apologize for the time I hurt you
And the time before that
And the time before that
And the time before that
But uh I just wanted to let you know
I do be thinking about you
Fuck, I said it
I do be thinking about you
Damn

[Hook x4: Dom Kennedy]
See you just the other day
Want you just another night
I can't let your panties go
We can still be homies right?
