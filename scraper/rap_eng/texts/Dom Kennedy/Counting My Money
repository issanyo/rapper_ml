[Verse 1: Kent]
A lot of shit gon' change when niggas start gettin' money
Caucasion dads mad cause they baby girls say they love me
Flow hotter than a model walkin down Rodeo
She think she bad cause her Gucci bag ain't even a day old
Old friends say I'm stuck up cause I smoke up in Bel Air
Rollin' roun' in my CL63AMG lookin' player
My girl gon' love me cause I'm passionate
Ignoring calls from Kim Kardasian
Left a voicemail sayin' she got some cash to spend
Can't wait to OD doin' what ya'll niggas imagining
Girls say we hot, dudes think we cool
Kids listen to us every morning when they walk to school

[Hook:]
Driving fancy cars, dating movie stars
And I always count my money
Every girl I see wanna be with me, and
I can't blame 'em either
Same old shit different day
I'm rolling weed counting my money

[Verse 2: Joon]
A lot of this shit gon' change when niggas start gettin' money
Wodies wanna be brodies and bitches ain't actin' funny
No more, kushed than a med shop
Ladies giving Pez top, thicker than a dreadlock
Fucking me out of wedlock
And bet I get her like the inside of a bed box, boi-yong nigga
Bet I, bet I, bet I be in yo daughter playlist
While you regret ya life in ya Jetta I know you hate it
Cause I was that nigga in the party with you, drugged out
Now I'm teaching ya children what money life and love 'bout
Yea I understand but everybody got they own plan
Hope you see I'm a changed man

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Sleezy]
A lot of shit gon change when niggas start gettin' money huh
Keys in the range, old friends say I changed
Came into the game and got exactly what we wanted huh
Girls in different states toss they panties on the stage
It's kinda funny huh
Back then, couldn't afford a cut
Now I'm steady faded like yo taper countin' paper up
Courtside watchin' Lakers run
Mixing fun with the drugs
That's the funk to make yo speakers bump
It sound good, don't it?
ODoz. got them flows from the hood
Now they on us tryna clone it
Trees got me zoning
I'm higher than the Palms
Sound the alarm
We the bomb, hi mom

[Hook:]
Driving fancy cars, dating movie stars

[Verse 3: Dom Kennedy]
Yeah, I'm goin' crazy this winter
I'm tryna get money like baby, what up Brenda
I wrote this on the back of the plane, what up Spitta
So if I met you once it's a chance I don't remember
Since I go to sleep for breakfast and I'm waking up to dinner
Are my pockets getting fat or these girls just gettin thinner
That's just one thing I observed
And right next to my name on my card it says preferred
The cars always on time and the rooms always reserved
So after I eat this pizza then it's please do not disturb
I wear these dreams like a sweater on me
Tryna decide what Benz will look better on me
Just tryna focus on the now but I know its people out there who got hopes to bring me down
I'm a throw it in ya face nuh uh you just see me smile
It's no cursing in my raps I wish the Pope could see me now
I made it this far you won't defeat me now
You gone have to hang a cross, tie me up and beat me down
But the people will return see me there and bring me down
And when I touch the ground they gone drop the single out
I'm drivin'

[Hook:]
Fancy cars, dating movie stars
And I always count my money
Every girl I see wanna be with me, and
I can't blame 'em either
Same old shit different day
