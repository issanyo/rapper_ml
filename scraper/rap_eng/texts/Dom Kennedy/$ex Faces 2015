[Verse 1: Dom Kennedy]

Yup, I'm vibing with you
Go ahead and make your home movie girl I'm riding with you
'My Type of Party' still bumping in the 60's
Me and Archie Davis like Face and J. Prince
We only make endz cutoff your fake friends
Take a vacation with me just say when
I ain't been nowhere in a while but laid back
Get all up in her ear and state facts
I ain't from Houston look baby where Dreams at
I can do the Southside too stream that
Ass like, pretty and a mean rack
I took another sip of the yac' and leaned back
To my surprise she forgot who my face is
The same one from 3 years ago in here waiting
On her to realize the truth in her sights
But that ain't gone stop me from fucking on her tonight
I'm not the one with my shirt off on the mic
But we do freaky shit I tickle her on her right
Take a little time for yourself you need help
I'm not only talking about wealth I mean health
It's not good to have that pinned up all inside
When all you got to do is call me and take a ride
Listen to some 40, Nas, or Do or Die
She brought a pair of heels, sandals, and puma clydes
Anybody get in the way get minimized
But I rather worry about if the chicken is tenderized
Blue, red, and green in her eyes is this a sign
She don't got a fucking Snapchat or a Vine
So i took her to a world of a lot of 'Lex Faces
A lot of car keys, you just a spectator (whoa)

Niggas like me do this shit all the time
I might buy a house in Sugar-land, I'm bored

[Chorus: Devin The Dude]
You must be used to all the finer things
Infatuated by what money brings
It seems to me you, will never change (and you hoe niggas)
So all that's left is for us to exchange

[Verse 2: Jay 305]
Checking in the Viceroy
Baby all on me back up I fuck your life up
Hotel gym pull up do some push ups
Run 2 miles J1 I need a fresh cut
Champagne sipping pour it out fresh cup
Santal 33 smelling like milly
Balmain belt holding up the Dickies
Snapchat that pussy wax and DM's is tricky
She got some bomb head but the the pussy was mickey
Fucked her homegirl, small world, Disney
Don't shop the malls these days I'm to picky
Saint Laurent shades gold chains with the baldy
A/C at 65 bumping Still Callin
Other People Money's ya bitch we still ballin
Jay 305 ya bitch I'm still ballin ya dick
And I'm tell you this secret
Every bitch I fucked done sucked my dick
AKA Mr. never-seen-with-a-weak-bitch

And that's how I gone keep it
I'm cold on these hoes like Alaska (church)
Came through, Dom had one
I had one, we was somewhere
I can't remember, we been so many places
