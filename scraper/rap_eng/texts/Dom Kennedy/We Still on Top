[Verse 1]
Ask them niggas at the corner store
And them strip club bitches, they know this for sure
Every time we come through we got cash like them niggas on Vernon Ave
Make them empty all the bags
You want money let's get it
You got hoes let's fuck em
What you smoking on let me hit something
Let y'all predict it I'll outsmart y'all niggas
You won't win shit I'll John stark y'all niggas
You got it fucked up really
You fucked up really
Cause now everybody gonna know the truth
Got 35 pair but all I seem to wear is two
Don't plan on fucking tonight but prepared if I do

[Hook 1]
I wanna roll grass together
Look a gray photographs and have cash forever
I'm gone trade my benz and get my dad Carrera
Niggas can't fuck with me
The bitches that fuck with me I'm down

[Chorus:]
Spend 80 thou on rack that's what that asking
New Bo Jacksons I stay on point
She know if she roll me she better stay on point
I got another one on my line texting me now
With the back and forth acting brand new every week
Like y'all ladies do the only pussy I eat
Gotta be mine all mine
Or it's not going down
Same thing for beat
Damn we still on top

[Interlude:]
First thing we park that Bentley
P.J (?) parking lot
I mean you can fuck with me baby
They fucking around on Melrose
We got to grow
There is mo money in Orange County anyway fuck with me

[Verse 2]
And they say no if they broke
If they get money they agree
Don Julio when I pee
Veuve Roseâ€™ when I skeet
Tell them please keep the mic going
I don't really gotta think (no I don't)
I just really came to this bar
Ended up buying all drinks
Everywhere we go I got a tab
Everywhere we at I got stacks
Threw up OPM in the pic
A lot of nice cars in the click
She wanna go hard for the click
No overtime it's lit
You already know you gotta represent
You already know you gotta represent
Sip what you like fuck what you want
We don't throw salt
Buy what you need
Splurge when you can
Just play your part
I don't just talk
Look in the vault
I wrote the plan

You see me 200 thousand in Orleans in your parking lot baby

[Chorus: 2x]
Spend 80 thou on rack that's what that asking
New Bo Jacksons I stay on point
She know if she roll me she better stay on point
I got another one on my line texting me now
With the back and forth acting brand new every week
Like y'all ladies do the only pussy I eat
Gotta be mine all mine
Or it's not going down
Same thing for beat
Damn we still on top
