[Verse 1]

She was 5'5, sweet with a cool body
I wanna say I met her at a little pool party
At her sisters, she was out of town
So she fixed up, LA house parties
You know how niggas get mixed up
In Gin, Tonic, Grey Goose, we got it
And like 03 so we was still on hypnotic
Then I spotted her, tapped my nigga Dre like, "I got it brah"
Got at her, called the next day just to acknowledge that
Pride, had to swallow that
Trust, don't want to Hollow that
Your heart can get broken, naw, you don't want to follow that
But fuck it, I jumped, We had our little months
I took her to 305, we had our little fun
But your dislikes I did like, yea I remember them nights
I went home thinkin, "Man, I can't do shit right"
I'm damned if I stay and I'm damned if I leave ya
You just wasn't ready and well, I wasn't either

[Hook: 3x]
I'm still lookin y'all

[Verse 2]
Now next it was Sarah, at best it was "whatever"
Cause I was kind of young, and that she was scared of
Like "you dream of Porches, I'm goin Corporate
If you don't want a relationship then I'm gonna abort this"
I did like any nigga would, make her feel important
Had a spot on the roster so I had to fill the void in
Avoiding all long term plans, we hold hands like couples do
Tell her "if you want it, it's up to you"
But after we go sexin, she would pose questions
Like, "Like after I spend a night Dom can we go to breakfast?"
HUH? I didn't knew that, right before I screw that
You would catch feelings, now love you can't do that
You say I'm fucked up, but I know it ain't true
I'mma find her one day, but I know it ain't you

[Hook: 5x]

[Verse 3]
I'm still looking after (SSSHHHH), Yea she was priceless
The perfect definition what a wife was I liked her
From AIM to the E-Mails, fly little female
Wasn't that official yo, A nigga still miss you though
And Tina was dreamer, I'm 2 years a Senior
So I didn't really vibe with her demeanor but I leaned her
She would say I lied to, her like all guys do
But I ain't goin in if I could pull through the drive-thru
And you I done lied to, it's ain't because I tried to
Just that I didn't want to be the dude you always cried to
Leave you I've tried to, but you would always lie through
Like "What you want to eat, is there some shoes I can buy you?"
And the neck you provide boo was wet like the Bayou
I just never did what the next nigga might do
And when you heard this song, I thought you would flip
Oh when we first met, I thought you was it

[Hook]

[Samples]
She wants that old thing back
Tease me, I don't want it if it's that easy
I'm not only a client, I'm the Player President, One more chance

[Outro]
