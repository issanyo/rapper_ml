[Verse:]
Man i got these hoes talking about me and nut
So I’m out here all day and RJ telling me i need them on the 3rd verse
Me personally homeboy i don't give a fuck
Reheat the leftover in the oven
Roll it up and light the bitch up
Don't talk me to death you have drunk niggers poet
If she backstage guarantee i can fuck
You know what i mean I’m tattoo and all
Medallions iced up don't like yelling much
My benz telling me to get in
Me and her still in touch some feel I’m locked up
My heart don't fuck with strangers
So i don't twitter much raise my feet up
One day all we got to do is get out rap life up
Leave them dessert she up here she getting
Bone yard on the first lifes funny millionaires flirt
And her hunny i can bet you never made her squirt
7 inches on TV make her twerk
It going to take one hour to have her to squirt whoa
It’s like one two three
I mean these shows be so crazy sometimes homes
Sometimes i don't even know what i am going to put out
I put on with so many women with my face vibrating
I pay my specialist a visit i went to the counter and then who do i see
Posters everywhere she knows exactly who i be
Immediately i started thinking about grill
A nigga like me have gentle in the bath tub
Looking through the bag i forgot how my hat be
Anyway quickly and call it flash flood
Homies in jail like damn what am i cuz
I know gang bang but a nigga that act tough
Where you from philly i know you got so much going on
Back when my sideburns were just growing up
Now OPM is up next, sure enough
25 for the Mowet pull it up
If you from the motherfucking west throw it up west throw it up
These offbrand niggas upset
Might trade the truck in and go and get vette
Just to ride down imperial witcho ex
I can say really i got no regrets
Nah all i do is rap get have sex and get dressed
Show you how to get your check now you got your respect
Before i hit the set i hit the reset
Holding with some chicks playing on some defense
Fucking with a dropout because I’m a reject
Oh boy J i know you heard the name
I take my cars like my lexus dark and my kensas
Yea just like pollen of the year bluevale white porsche
Call it in the year
I swear it was like rapping so trendy
I woke up get my glass to dress up my feeling
Ply forgetting letting the holy matrimony
Be rich Mack and getting money after the matching parties
At home we will be whining like a pimp mode
Whoa i put my robbers on my retro
Whoa i be swerving on some test runs
Paid the debts though I’m feeling shit up in my lane up high
I’m a straight up pimp as soon as the bird lands I’m going to eat
Your trick I’m going to be in that benz and that O10
And you can't see your bitch taking big old dick
And I’m all on the grind with a member
Coming taking shows if i had to do
And now because they got my rap name blast
At front posing for some front line
And back stage pass
I need to lean on somebody every time I’m falling
But never seen you though before
What you all doing dress like baller of the year boo
Light bottom light top call it in the air
I come by every time i fall in here
Her mom use to say little boy don't call her here
I would still call her i don't care you
Can do what you want you the baller of the year
