[Intro]
Same back channel (oh)
Time to undress this sample
50 dancers on stage like hammer (whoa)

[Verse 1]
When im on stage show me tits
I did Barclays, naw for real
A couple write ups in the Source
Offer provided to a porche
We make a whole lotta noise
Leaving out the valley in my toy
And my locs are Tom Ford, and I speak that bonjour
Ménage à trois with a twist
Whip cream and tequila, ooh that's it
Always got me when I need you, ooh that’s it
Independent but you still gotta get hit
Im thinking over the fence, us in the 62 non comprence(?)
I let her brag about me to her friends
One day you might taste the perfect ten

[Hook]
I might flex for no reason
Do it for my ones that ain't breathn
And you can't hang with us, if you don’t bank with us
Those bitches lame to us, those niggas lame to us
You try so hard to step, might spend a hunin this month

[Verse 2]
Pull up to the spot playn near (?)
Liquor already got em on they tip
Aces(?) at the door, they tryna get in
You ain't really with the shit, you tryna fit in
They say he crashed it up and got em a benz
I might curve my bottom chick, she too thin
But then again they usually freaks
I know a few that got that heat
Round here we play for keeps
Your paper looking incomplete
FF Ferrari, need that next
7 bedrooms with your favorite ex
I fuck with real niggas like Mike Epps
Derrick Fisher with one shot left
Tell yo ----- there ain't no spots left
Raising a 7 year old king in the process

[Hook]
I might flex for no reason
Do it for my ones that ain't breathn
And you can't hang with us, if you don't bank with us
Those bitches lame to us, those niggas lame to us
You try so hard to step, might spend a hunin this month

[Outrox2]
No matter what they tell you
No matter what they tell you
No matter what they tell you
No matter what
