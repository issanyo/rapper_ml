[Intro]

Uhh, Yeah

[Verse 1: Dom Kennedy]

It's funny how hoes be controlling nigga's
It's always money over bitches thought I told you nigga's
Don't never turn fake, stay a soldier nigga
And its an OPM thing, 'til it's over nigga
Lil sag in ya jeans when you fall on scenes
And we grind all winter just to ball all spring
I had the whip sitting clean on them chrome 15's
Said "Dom I never seen, no shit this clean"
We drink Hennessy, w/ apple juice always actin' loose
Sometimes we can play scrabble and drink Snapple juice
But I rather smoke with you baby and then fuuuck
Let me set the camera up, and cut

[Hook: Dom Kennedy]

So much liquor and weed
All my nigga's is G'z
So many women inside (so many of 'em)
Finna have a hell of a night (it's plenty of 'em)
All my nigga's is G'z(all of em)
So much liquor and weed (so much yeah)
So many women inside
We finna have a hell of a night

[Verse 2: Dom Kennedy)

I had on house shoe's
I'm at Poodoh's, smoke sumo
I hate when Pollo Loco be having no more Churro's
Fox news, channel 5, Telemundo
I need me a cute Spanish chick name Lulo
So much liquor and trees
I threw up all on my 3's
I don't wanna drink 'n' drive
Lemme go to sleep in your thighs

[Hook: Dom Kennedy]

So much liquor and weed
All my nigga's is G'z
It's So many women inside
Finna have a hell of a night
All my nigga's is G'z
So much liquor and weed
It's so many women inside
We finna have a hell of a night
