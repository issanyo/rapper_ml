[Verse 1: Lakim Shabazz]
This beat is chunky, lyrics are spunky and tough
You wanna battle? You ain't funky enough
Lak Shabazz'll throw a lyrical roundhouse to uplift
The spirits'll hear it 'cause Mark came up with
The slamming sound that is dope and high technical
You say to yourself this is the best that you've ever heard
Coming from a musical sampler
The beat is like a [?] baby, the Markey pampers it
'Til it's perfected then he injects it into a tape cassette
Mistakes are corrected, he's orally respected
Yo Mark, it gets kinda hectic
You're the director, so direct this beat in the right direction
With my voice in the background kicking the lyrics I'm willing to bet
It's gonna go gold, behold the untold
My rhymes are hard, yours are soft like a casserole
It doesn't bother me to burst your bubble, you want trouble?
No problem, I'll give it to you right on the double
So quick and fast, you know I will last
My name is Lak Shabazz, give me a task, the test I'll pass
Pay close attention, so you don't miss the style of the rhyme
It has jazz, charisma
The hype is here so wipe your tears, my dear
It's '88, time to elevate and get fierce
I'm getting fierce

[Verse 2: Lakim Shabazz]
Are you awaken? Well get up on your good foot, listen up
Let the fabulous one put this raw deal together
That appeals to the adolescent crowd that will appreciate what I do
Is kick lyrics, say them loud and clear for y'all to hear it
I'm higher, under, I roll like thunder
Sometimes down deep in your mind, I know it makes you wonder
About what's gonna happen next, you tryna diss
That's when I start snapping necks
You wanna rumble? Come on, I fight fair
My name is not Fred and this is not a nightmare
I'm not deluded, polluted
I'm one of the coolest, intelligent brothers far-fetched from
A foolish man, but certain [?] mine, and do what I wanna do with it
I think it's 'bout time to convince you to get into the flow
As he rolls and living large, I know you wanna battle me, bro
That's a no-no, 'cause many of days go by, my rhymes mature
They're pure and not your, I can't be conquered
The hype is here so wipe your tears, my dear
It's '88, time to elevate, and get fierce
