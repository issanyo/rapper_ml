[Verse: Lakim Shabazz]
This style is infinite, different
I'm a menace to society, varieties of brothers admit to this
That I'm an expertise, unleashing my rap
I'll pulverise a woofer, explode a hi-hat
I start to catch a microphone tantrum, turn into a phantom
Beats I slam them down on you, you
You want to rock, shake and slide and dance
Let me inform you, to the knowledge, the basic foundation
Of all things in existence from my mind, you can't erase this
You can try but to try is to fail
I won't fail, I'll always prevail
'Cause I speak wise words from a mouth which is wisdom
Like an ocean that never runs dry
It'll lift you, make you draw clear picture, hit ya with lyrics
Science of self behind it
It fits you right where you need to be fitted at
Your weak rhymes, I slam 'em down and spit it idly
'Cause I'm not just your ordinary MC that comes along
My way of life tells me how to make knowledge born
I free the dumb from the ignorant, from the lies
And slavery of a mental death known as Christianity
A mental change will release from your mental composition
So listen with [?], let me make this proposition
The power of Allah, it wins me over
Arm, leg, leg, arm, head is in me
So you see this style that I use
I have you thinking my lyrics was simply pure taboo
But it's not, it's the nature of God
With a kick and a snare and a bass drum that hits hard
Death defiant I'm not lying, me and my alliance: The Flavor Unit
We're coming off so don't try us
