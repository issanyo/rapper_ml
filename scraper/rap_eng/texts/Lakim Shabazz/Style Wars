[Verse 1: Lakim Shabazz]
See, what you gotta do is man your battle stations I'm gracin
Contest, start the process of elimination
Make a maneouvre, you move too fast to see
Who's next up? Let's see who's last decree
My strike is fatal, you feel the wrath, you're doomed
Today is gonna be dog day's afternoon
Rappers, I torture, teach em what naughty means
Pick 'em like coffee beans and show em what 'off me' means
They go against, they never win, they get dock-seated
Lyrics hit you so hard you think you had a shock treatment
Rappers, I pass flash by 'em like a thunderclap
My mic is a axe, so call me a rapping lumberjack
A terrorizin terror makin no errors
You're a duck, so I'ma pluck all of your feathers
My voice remounts, it's full like a fountain
MCs, I caught em, manslaughter em while I'm countin
They mullah, then I look in they crew's eye
Watch em take a deep breath, then step from the set
'Cause my killer instincts will show in deadly ways
Look around, can you count all the heads I laid?
Lak Shabazz, a menace, a real trouble maker
Let it be known that I'm hard, I love to take a
Weak wack rapper and make him look down to me
Because he looks like Bozo the Clown to me
Everything is serious, nothin to smile for
You gotta brace yourself for the style wars

(We are ready to go to war - now)
(We are ready to go to war - now)

[Verse 2: Lakim Shabazz]
Well, I'm back to attack, clash of a mic and a titan
I'm fully equipped to rip and totally enlighten
Lyrics are swift and smooth, hit you real, see
When you hear em, you forget all about the beat
Lak's the name, not a game like double dare
MC' get scared or beware because trouble's here
You wanna battle me? Hey look, go for it
Your lyrics are old school, prehistoric
Ancient, corroded and busted
Greasy and dirty and full of combustion
What a flop, what a pity, what a waste of time
You want def rhymes? Here's a taste of mine
Lyrics I write contain a hard, def style
Yours are soft and moist, made out of textile
( ? ), put em in the double x file
Of wack rappers, they gotta exiled
Call me an undertaker, I use my mic like a guillotine
Take 10 seconds to find out what killer mean
There's always a sucker in the crowd that'll spill the beans
So just bodybag him and ship him to the Philippines
Mission accomplished like I promised
You're on a wack staff, I got the last laugh
I'm cold serious, nothin to smile for
You gotta brace yourself for the style wars

[Hook]
Cause these are the style wars

Ah yeah, Flavor Unit in effect
1990, small things behind me
Righteous Force Productions in effect
You know what I'm sayin
Cold rippin off necks

And I'm outta here
We in effect, y'all
Peace
