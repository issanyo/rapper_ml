[Verse: Lakim Shabazz]
Cee's a king, a menace at making beats
Dance or prance or just take the seat
It's causing chaos, confusion, all types of turbulence
Have you heard of this? 'Cause I'ma murder this
Beat to break you down, shake the ground
My people party hardy, make a sound
Make some noise if not he'll sample it
Then come over beats the rhymes I'll handle it
The new rap on the block, this man will loop it
The 45 King of swing gets stupid
The super duper producer gets looser
Keep in step 'cause he's deaf and he'll choose the right beat
For me to kick and make it quick of who is live and who's jive
So take your pick, make sure you're intelligent
Are you a man? If the answer is yes, yo, that settles it
Do the knowledge first before you converse
Express your thoughts, opinions or be cursed
By a lyrical prophet
The money I pocket is a never winning battle for you so stop it
You can make an attempt at the title I clench that
Your mad and sad 'cause you went back
To your old ways of acting wild
Now you gotta keep your poise or Mark'll sample the dope noise
We got beats and rhymes combine like cuts
Upon the beats is Mark, on the cuts C-Just
You want some of this?
Why don't you come and get some flavor unit
Fine tuning it, you'll get dissed
It's time to start to [?]
More pushing and pulling, more power than a Mack truck
What's your job slob? Do you steal or rob?
Why don't you tell me what's happening hobs?
I'm Asiatic, original, rhymes are critical
The mathematical terms I express are dialectical
I got gusto, I'ma make Just go get another record
From the crates so it cuts the flow
Elevating, constantly straight up
You step in my cage I'll enrage, you get ate up
Your falling is your fault, don't start yelling hawk
You sleep, let me awaken you
My rhymes are like smelling salt
The 45 King is talented and complete
Like accent for me to give flavor to all beats
My Earth in fine, I know you want to [?] her
But she's mine, I know every square inch of her
So I'm telling you now you can't have none of her
You better step back you new jack 'cause I'm a son of a-
Gun, ready to stun, so keep your poise
And let the 45 King sample the dope noise
