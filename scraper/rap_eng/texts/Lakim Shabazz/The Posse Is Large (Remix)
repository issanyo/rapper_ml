[Verse 1: Lakim Shabazz]
I'm speakin' on the posse the P-O-double S
Drop the E, no, bring it back to reality
Put it back on the end so I can begin
And start sayin' raw, dope rhymes again
I know you like this friends, are you listenin'?
Because a brother like Lakim'd like to discipline
You, your girl, you boys who like to make noise
Or make some as I get dumb
My literature is truely hardcore, all you fruit punch
You better stay back, you're not ready for a style like this
That blends with cuts, no matter no weather you gotta get up
And stay in touch with the man like Shabazz, I can go fast
Or slow the tempo down, I won't use no hesitation
'Cause I'm constantly elevatin' to the top so sit back and be patient
My style is dope on the rope
Now can you cope with the rhymes that I bring
45 King, as the beat'll go with it
Cee Just provides the cut, the power and thrust
That backs me up, never whack me up
But it enables me to become a number one pro
I am symbolic to knowledge so I gots to know
The foundation of all things in existence
Nonetheless, before you fall over the ledge, you misfit
I came to tell ya the posse is takin' charge
The 45 King kickin' the beat yo, the posse is large

The posse is large

[Verse 2: Lakim Shabazz]
I'm down with the L-the A-the T-double E, A-P-A-C-H-E
Latee and Apache, my brother Live: the creator of the Flavor
Apache wrote the smooth on our cut
Then he saved the part for me to get mine 'cause he get theirs
Never nervous on stage, no butterflies in my stomach
'Cause I'm not scared, I just grab the mic and go for broke
And won't choke and I will provoke the crowd to get live and wild
Bringin' a brand new style of rappin', tell me if you tippin'
Or if you tappin' your feet to the beat
That Mark program that slam, I get you understand
We like to jam my man, now get up and get the Chill Rob G
Double J, [?], the great Alibaski, huh
We take rap serious, that's not a hobby to us
And we've been blessed with the princess of a posse
Her name is Latifah, her alias is Dana
And after this we'll gain at least a million, a billion, a trillion or a zillion
Whatever you wanna call it, we'll be cold chillin'
I came to tell ya the posse is takin' charge
The 45 King kickin' the beat yo, the posse is large
I'm tellin' you, we real large
In the house Flavor Posse '88
With my man DJ Cee Justice and The 45 King, peace
