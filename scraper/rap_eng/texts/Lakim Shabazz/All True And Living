[Verse 1: Lakim Shabazz]
See I'm an all true and living
So take heed to the knowledge that I'm giving
And you will be uprisen upon your highest point of achievement
You will receive this, loud and clear and I mean this
It's a warning or precaution, proceed with caution
I'm so manipulant I'll use distortion
To twist out the normal shape, all natural
I'm right and exact, my facts are actual
I'll make you freeze, seize where you stand man
Lock 'em up and chop 'em up just like Mr. Hangman
With negative brothers and suckers yeah I dealt with
I won more championships than the Celtics
Got a feeling for rap the first time I felt this
I got me a pad, a paper and a felt tip
And started going to work with rhymes and words
I'm not a joke or jerk, got no time for nerds
I got the time, a rhyme make money and things
You want a taste of honey, girl, give me a ring
'Cause I'm a father, I'll fill you with the cream
Of life, that's right, 'cause I'm an original being
I'm very militant prepare for the holy-caust
Are you the same, if not take a total loss
You keep listening you will be uprisen
From a regular slave by the all true and living

[Verse 2: Lakim Shabazz]
I'm pushing rhymes of a heavyweight, yours are middleweight
It ain't my fault you came to the party just a little late
You lost your turn to rock, now it's your turn to jock
A real rap professional, burn the block down
'Cause I'm a lyrical prophet prophesizing my
Literature which is hardcore and ask if I
Give a damn, my man, about what you want to do
'Cause I'mma tell you right now what I'm gonna do
Take a 120 ducks, a 120 suckers, a 120 more blind, deaf and dumb brothers
Fake emcees, wannabes, yeah that's good and plenty of 'em
And I'll demolish all 360 of 'em
The number of blind brothers used to multiply
They were fed the wrong foods, taught loads of lies
Now it's decreasing 'cause I'm unleashing my knowledge of self
I'm holding my belt and I'm teaching
Those that need to be taught and brought up
Into a square of pure righteousness and get caught up
With the lessons, they're a blessing and keep you from guessing
All praises are due to Allah, you get the message
'Cause I'm a provider of lyrical torture
I absorb lyrics like a sponge does water
To me knowledge is food like Dig 'Em Smacks
I'm digging, keep listening
To the all true and living
