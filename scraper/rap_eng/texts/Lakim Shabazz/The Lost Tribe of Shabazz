Our people will survive America

[Verse 1]
My people were took from the motherland
By the other man
Brought to the wilderness
Like a ventriloquist
Played my people like puppets by plantin' fear in their heart
Nowadays most of us don't know where to start
10% of us can help, but don't feel the need
They love greed
And this really bothers me
85% of us are totally ignorant
Walkin' around with the nigga mentality
5% of us are ready to die for the cause
Of course the source is Elijah
Knowledge of self is what you need to stop the bull
If you don't get it, I'm held responsible
Rhymes I make are designed to reach the youth
I gotta teach, that's why I speak the truth
Some waste time dwellin' on the past
It's time they know that we're the lost tribe of Shabazz

Our people will survive America
Our people will survive America

[Verse 2]
Stay awake and don't sleep, 'cause I'm comin' after ya
Devils I smash and leave 'em flat as a spatula
Back again, the mathematical radical
Gettin' emotional, very emphatical
The original man uses 23 million square miles on the planet Earth
Constantly buildin'
On the other hand the other man wants to confuse ya
Simple psychology, tricknowlogy fools ya
They have you believe we descend from cannibals
Show you pictures of Africans lookin' like animals
How could we be animals, look at the things we did
With our own bare hands we built pyramids
Blind, deaf, and dumb is how they raised ya
To them it's Africa, to us it's Asia
To get to the point, to make it clear to ya
They're no superior, and we're not inferior
I got the other man pointin' at me, 'cause I licked him
Took a stand for the black man, and didn't fall victim
The nation is growin' rapid and fast
That's why I'm tellin' you we're the lost tribe of Shabazz

Our people will survive America
Our people will survive America
Our people will survive America
Our people will survive America

[Verse 3]
I couldn't wait to battle a beat like this track
It's so def, I had to pump my fist, black
My rhymes weigh six sextillion tons
Heavy as the Earth, a lyrical function
Imagine if every black man, woman and child
Would simply refuse
To go to work for one day
Do you know how much money these companies would lose?
Since everything's based on money, that's what we gotta get
We gotta learn when to quit, when not to quit
It's really sad, I know some people
Think that one day we'll be treated as equal
It's the land of the freedom, or so they say so
They tell you're free, yeah, but free to do what though?
Off our arms and legs they took the chains
Big deal - they still left 'em around our brains
Things I say make the government fear this
I speak with authority, so you can hear this
I hate oreos, that's why I gots to bomb
You so-called niggerish Uncle Toms
We're on a rise-up, you better wise up
You can't stop us, now are you surprised, duck?
You might take it as a political outblast
But we're the lost Tribe of Shabazz

Our people will survive America
Our people will survive America
Our people will survive America
Our people will survive America
Our people will survive America
Our people will survive America
Our people will survive America
Our people will survive America
