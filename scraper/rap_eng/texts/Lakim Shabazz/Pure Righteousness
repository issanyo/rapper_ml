[Verse 1: Lakim Shabazz]
Peace as I unleash
Style of the wild, tell a lyrical masterpiece
Swift as a summer's breeze
The knowledge I possess is power of self and it gives me
The strength to go the length
You're yapping, flapping off at the lid
'Cause you must have been sleeping, now you slept
You see you're lost in the sauce boy, did you forget I kept
The beat intact and I'll spark this
It's elevated, created straight from total darkness
I freeze your mental comp, word to herb I can do this
Because my mind is my third eye
I show and prove, the multitude
Is the crowd that I will move
I have to say today you and your boys you're not right for this
I'm raw and rare, I stand in a square of pure righteousness

Righteously pure

[Verse 2: Lakim Shabazz]
See I'm pure, clean, I mix with anything
Not contaminated, but reanimated
First I was living the life of a blind one
Now I'm sincere, polite and a kind one
The devil planted fear in my heart, I was just a child
That was long ago
In the meanwhile I'll manipulate 'em, then I'll make 'em
Kneel to the power of God 'cause I'm hard and I'll take 'em
Through trials and tribulations, miles of aggravation
I'm yearning, I'm determined, my determination
Is strong, I have the will to bill you
Fill you with the cream of life and appeal to
The adolescent crowd who are youngsters
Dump all your wack rhymes into my dumpster
I came to tell you that you are not right for this
I'm raw and rare, I stand in a square of pure righteousness

[Verse 3: Lakim Shabazz]
See I'm righteous, you wonder how I got to this
Think about it, form a hypothesis
An educated guess upon who can manifest
Ejaculate lyrics into the mic at your request
Well it's me, G-O-D
I'm God, my number is 7
I'm def and all those things that coincide with dopeness
It didn't take long to perform and to quote this
A lyrical prophet prophesizing poetry
Why don't you wise up, come on and go with me
Into this realm where I dwell as a king
The brothers follow the path, the wrath of Lakim
I'm your spice of life, my rhymes are nice and tasteful
The stage is a battlefield, that's where I'mma waste you
To be specific, yo I'm terrific
Talented and gifted, you're wondering if it's
A brother being careless, try to compare this
Rhyme to another emcee, your result'll be fatal
Because the God is willing and able
You're like a brand new baby, I rocked your cradle
I'm telling you boy, you ain't right for this
I'm raw and rare, I stand in a square of pure righteousness
