This is real live flavor, up to date data
Beats programmed by sampler cause Mark made a
Another def jam it's gonna slam my friend
Lakim is rockin' raw dope rhymes again
Peace brothers and sisters who are out there
Giving me your attention
I'd like to share with you, bear witness to you
That I'm not scared but prepared to do hard labor
Do me a favor, clean the wax out your ears
Cause this is the state of the art
To see whose lyrics is the most sharp
I came to tell you I'ma breed apart from the rest of them
I mean the best of them, I question them
Start testing them, then I manifested them
The knowledge, given to me by the almighty one
And while I'm doing my thing all night I'll have fun
It's not a hard task, it's kind of simple
And easy, just give me the instrumental
And I'ma rock ya all live and infinite
Style is unorthodox rhymes are most different
Alibaski, those are lyrical swift kick
I throw a lyrical roundhouse to uplift a party
If you're sittin' I'll make you get up
And check out this dope setup
Cause I'm fed up
With your weak rhymes, you think they could beats mines
But you and your lyrics just suck, they geek lines
I won't brag or boast cause I'm the most choice
From coast to coast you hear the dope voice
The type of guy that gets hyper
Keep your Heineken and pass me the pipe
Or pop it! Let the celebration begin
Yo, cuz I'm rockin' the raw dope rhymes again

This beat is like a woman I marry her
And carry her on, with lyrics so strong
They break the sound barrier
A man is intelligence and I'm an intelligent man
I don't believe in I can't cause I can
Get busy, copacetic, give me the credit
When it's deserved you know I have to get on some of your nerves
While I'm droppin', science like this
Over mic, it has to get some of you pissed
But really, it doesn't bother me
I just say so what the hell
You think I care, emphatically no
I'm here to rock ya, right here on the spot
No need to wonder I'ma tell ya what I got
Lyrics got loads to come, I'm not opposin' none
I'm getting dumb cuz I'm a chosen one
Party people get down now are you with me?
Comin' to you live in effect from the Brick City
Newark, known as hardcore heaven
No half-steppin' if you do you get left in the back
With the wack pack who talk junk and not write
In exact Jack, you better walk punk
Because your rhymes'll be battered and bruised
Uncontrolled I'm a shape, bake, rattle, and roll and mold
Them into rhymes I perfect this style
After that, you're guaranteed to crack a smile
So listen in to the rhymes that I send boy
Cause I'm rockin' the raw dope rhymes again
