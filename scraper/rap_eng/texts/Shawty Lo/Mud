[Hook: Shawty Lo]
I’m from the mud
Real mud dealer, sold a lot of drugs
Came to be the plug
Real dope dealer, kingpin nigga
I whip it up
Last man standing, they can’t understand me
Look what I’ve done
Thug life nigga, I was raised in the jungle
That’s where I’m from

[Verse 1: Shawty Lo]
Pull up in this bitch like Frank White
Straight up off that water, got great white
And I remember on them late nights
Grandma want me in before the streetlights
Rest in peace to grandma, I really miss you shawty
Now I’m doing good, all they do is talk about me
Sold a lot of deals and I got my own sack
One hundred in the street, I ain’t never been a rat
The mud
It’s about the money, the power, the love
Shout out to my bitches get money, what’s up
If you pray for rain gotta deal with the mud
And I ain’t never gave a fuck
Shawty L-O
Got it for the L-O
One home shawty
Bankhead hero
Ocean Drive nigga, doin’ my thing
We got um and um, talking everything

[Hook: Shawty Lo]
I’m from the mud
Real mud dealer, sold a lot of drugs
Came to be the plug
Real mud dealer, show ‘em how to move
Show ‘em how to grow
Real mud dealer, show my niggas love
It’s in my blood
Real mud dealer, see you niggas move

[Verse 2: Front Street]
Gettin’ money in my blood
Got it up out the mud
Never dealt with the middleman
Went straight to the plug
Born home here I’m from
BHF to the death of me
Brad ski on the left
And L-O on the right of me
Yeah nigga, this Front Street
Got it in up on front street
Lemme say this where I’m at it
Got my own money now, a nigga fronted me
Niggas hating ain’t nothing to me
Mad ‘cause they still up under me
I’m getting money, yeah abundantly
In my coat where that thunder be
Yeah, I got it up out the mud
Five chains on ho, oh what a flood
Bitch ass nigga, you acting just like a stud
Reason my cup is so dirty, ‘cause I be drinking on mud

[Hook: Shawty Lo]
I’m from the mud
Real mud dealer, sold a lot of drugs
Came to be the plug
Real dope dealer, kingpin nigga
I whip it up
Last man standing, they can’t understand me
Look what I’ve done
Thug life nigga, I was raised in the jungle
That’s where I’m from

[Outro: Lynn Tate]
Real mud dealers, sold a lot of drugs
Came to the plug
Real dope dealer, kingpin nigga
I whip it up
I whip it up
I whip it up
That's where I'm from
