[Chorus]
Louie V bag be, that's where the cash be
Jeans stay sagging, million dollar mouthpiece
Louie V bag be, that's where the cash be
Jeans stay sagging, million dollar mouthpiece
Louie V bag be, that's where the cash be
Jeans stay sagging, million dollar mouthpiece
Louie V bag be, that's where the cash be
Jeans stay sagging, million dollar mouthpiece

[Verse 1: Quondo]
If you ain't know, yeah, hoe, but you can call me Lil Lo
Sing this song real low with Frontstreet and two hoes
Yeah, I can cop it, folk, anything, I'll drop it folk
Yeah, the next CEO, tell them what it is, folk
Fifteen, doing my thing, and I stay fresh and clean
The finest thing you ever seen, the finest thing you ever seen
Twenty karats, one ring, D4L, dream team
You like the way the chain swing on my red Monkey jeans
I'm stunting like my daddy, nah, that's for real
And in my bank account, I got a cool mill
'Bout to hit your momma, nigga starting to hit your daughter
Nigga taught to be a soldier, nigga, head above the water

[Chorus]
Louie V bag be, that's where the cash be
Jeans stay sagging, million dollar mouthpiece
Louie V bag be, that's where the cash be
Jeans stay sagging, million dollar mouthpiece
Louie V bag be, that's where the cash be
Jeans stay sagging, million dollar mouthpiece
Louie V bag be, that's where the cash be
Jeans stay sagging, million dollar mouthpiece

[Verse 2: Shawty Lo]
Shawty Lo, yeah, hoe, you can call me boss, hoe
Fifty-thousand feet up, looking out the window
Yeah, that's a G4, just left the West Coast
Got a couple Pintos, yeah, Lo problems
Real supermodels, yeah, I'll start them
Couple gold bottles, fed them little lobster
Dessert, no cobbler, bitch got problems
Shawty, I solve them, it's no problem
The world still revolving, Shawty Lo balling
Bankhead

[Chorus]
Louie V bag be, that's where the cash be
Jeans stay sagging, million dollar mouthpiece
Louie V bag be, that's where the cash be
Jeans stay sagging, million dollar mouthpiece
Louie V bag be, that's where the cash be
Jeans stay sagging, million dollar mouthpiece
Louie V bag be, that's where the cash be
Jeans stay sagging, million dollar mouthpiece

[Verse 3: Lil Mark]
Catch me flying by in a two seater
Fitted hat bent in my white beater
I got these suckers high, something like a fever
Hurricane Cutlass, I call that bitch Katrina
When it come to flexing, I'm the best at it
Drive it two or three times, then let my ex have it
It's Lil Mark, baby, I know you heard of him
He eating off of publishing, you eating off of then
Arrogant of him, million dollar swag
Seven jeans sag, got these niggas mad
I be posted up, on Front Street
In a foreign car, driver's side right seat

[Chorus]
Louie V bag be, that's where the cash be
Jeans stay sagging, million dollar mouthpiece
Louie V bag be, that's where the cash be
Jeans stay sagging, million dollar mouthpiece
Louie V bag be, that's where the cash be
Jeans stay sagging, million dollar mouthpiece
Louie V bag be, that's where the cash be
Jeans stay sagging, million dollar mouthpiece

[Outro: Shawty Lo]
Say, what's happening?
This your boy, Shawty L-O, man
I'm da Man 2, man
Appetizer before the full-course meal
So let's get it, get it, get it
Still on Bankhead, still doing my thing, man
You know what I'm saying?
Units in the City finna drop, man
On y'all ass in October, man
Y'all niggas been waiting on this shit
Niggas been hating on this shit, man
But it's the done dada, done done
Done did it, let's get it
