[Verse 1: Jurrarri]
What's a hundred thousand? Nigga, it ain't shit
I spunt twenty bands just for my wrist
Ten in my ear, shawty, just to see the glitz
Another 30K for my neckpiece
Oh man, I'm so icy
I make the haters mad, they don't like me
It cost me 60 thou just to get icy
I'm still arrogant and high maintenance
Y'all love the hoes, I love Franklin's
Look at me, I got a million dollar mouthpiece
Close your mouth, shawty, they say talk cheap
I wear expensive shit, y'all wear a tall tee
I think I need help, I'm 'bout to do it, do it
Ju of D4L, bitch yeah, I do it, do it

[Chorus: Shawty Lo (Sampled)]
A hundred thousand in that bitch, I'm finna do it, do it
A hundred thousand in that bitch, I'm finna do it, do it
A hundred thousand in that bitch, I'm finna do it, do it
A hundred thousand in that bitch, I'm finna do it, do it
A hundred thousand in that bitch, I'm finna do it, do it
A hundred thousand in that bitch, I'm finna do it, do it
A hundred thousand in that bitch, I'm finna do it, do it
A hundred thousand in that bitch, I'm finna do it, do it
A hundred thousand in that bitch, I'm finna do it, do it
A hundred thousand in that bitch, I'm finna do it, do it

[Verse 2: Jurrarri]
Goddamn, Ju still spending money
Spending money and throwing cash, nigga, I got plenty money
You ain't seen the YouTube, been counting money
On my grind, every day, Monday through Sunday
Every day sunny, Stuntman told me that
How they get that money, nigga, L-O showed me that
The whip game [?] slipping, hell yeah, I'm the shit
When I made my first hundred thousand, I blew that shit
[?] cut the neck checks, six hundred thousand
I hear some niggas say, "Ju ain't getting money"
Getting money, bitch? I got a motherfucking record deal
Six hundred thou, that's a half a mill
Y'all niggas don't even got a record deal
They gotta deal with me, so just deal with it

[Chorus: Shawty Lo (Sampled)]
A hundred thousand in that bitch, I'm finna do it, do it
A hundred thousand in that bitch, I'm finna do it, do it
A hundred thousand in that bitch, I'm finna do it, do it
A hundred thousand in that bitch, I'm finna do it, do it
A hundred thousand in that bitch, I'm finna do it, do it
A hundred thousand in that bitch, I'm finna do it, do it
A hundred thousand in that bitch, I'm finna do it, do it
A hundred thousand in that bitch, I'm finna do it, do it
A hundred thousand in that bitch, I'm finna do it, do it
A hundred thousand in that bitch, I'm finna do it, do it
