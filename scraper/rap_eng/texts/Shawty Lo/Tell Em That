[Intro]
Nigga
Crank that shit up nigga
Nigga I’m flexing
Ok, ok ok
Ok ok, ok ok

[Hook]
Run tell ‘em that, run tell ‘em that
Run tell ‘em that, run tell ‘em that
Shawty back
Now tell ‘em that, now tell ‘em that
Now tell ‘em that, now tell ‘em that
And I let them things go like a quarterback
Peyton Manning, Mike Vick
Eli, I do this shit
Now tell ‘em that, now tell ‘em that
I let them things go like a quarterback

[Verse 1]
What’s ha’nen-nin?
Say what’s the word?
Up through this bitch
I got the birds
Who fly as me?
Only one man might can be
She O-D, I’m B-O-G
B-I-G, D-O-G
I like my girl
She like girls
Anything said behind my back considered fightin’ words
I got your lady, turned you to a hater nigga
You can start a war, it won’t end in your favor nigga
On my bullshit, Rosé by the cases
She might be bad to you, but to me she basic
Old money, new money, my money ageless
Big face, small face, just taste it

[Hook]
Run tell ‘em that, run tell ‘em that
Run tell ‘em that, run tell ‘em that
Shawty back
Now tell ‘em that, now tell ‘em that
Now tell ‘em that, now tell ‘em that
And I let them things go like a quarterback
Peyton Manning, Mike Vick
Eli, I do this shit
Now tell ‘em that, now tell ‘em that
I let them things go like a quarterback

[Verse 2]
There might be a Chevy on the block twerking
Twenty-four seven, we don’t stop serving
Rosé spilling, we never stop swerving
Got that raw Kelly bunny, and she not a virgin
House on the hills, Kelly cosign
I go to jail, Kelly bail me out in no time
Got a white girl fetish
Keep me in the streets and my side hoes jealous
Tell me what you want but you niggas know the truth
Getting money in the hood, growing while I’m in the booth
If her ass come back then you know we got a winner
Throw Kelly in the pot now she got a twin sister

[Hook]
Run tell ‘em that, run tell ‘em that
Run tell ‘em that, run tell ‘em that
Shawty back
Now tell ‘em that, now tell ‘em that
Now tell ‘em that, now tell ‘em that
And I let them things go like a quarterback
Peyton Manning, Mike Vick
Eli, I do this shit
Now tell ‘em that, now tell ‘em that
I let them things go like a quarterback
