[Intro: Birdman]
I'ma start this shit off straight and tell all three of y'all stop playing with my name. Stop playing with my fucking name. Put some respek on my name. Understand me? When y'all saying my name put some respek on it

[Hook]
I've been a rich homie
You just a bitch homie
Put some respek on it
Spend a little check on it
She got a frame on her
I put that thang on her
Put some Chanel's on her
Put some lil' fame on her
Put some respek on it
Put some respek on it
Put some respek on it, put some respek on it
Put some respek on it
I got a check homie

[Verse 1]
I'm from the Bank homie
I keep a bank on me
Shawty be dead fresh
This be a bank homie
I got that old money
I'm talking street money
Been with my day ones
These niggas'll kill for me

We had them bricks homie
You niggas just rap hustle
Never got street money
So shout to my blood
So shout to my cuz
So shout to my thugs
They show me love

[Verse 2]
Love the snow bunnies, talking bout them pink toes
Love them white girls, talking about that gas stove
I fell in love
I beat it up
I'm with her, I'm with her, I'm with her
Where I'm from they don't play with (?)
From the streets and I ain't gonna say it no more
I love the hood, talking bout that ghetto
Put some respek on me
I spend a little check on me

[Hook]
I've been a rich homie

[Outro]
Ain't with all that he said, she said. He say he ain't scared. Let me tell you like this, they don't bury the scared, they bury the dead. Put some respek on it, Shawty
