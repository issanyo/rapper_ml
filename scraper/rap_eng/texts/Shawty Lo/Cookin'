[Hook: Shawty Lo]
Man these hoes be tripping
Asking what I’m cooking
Cook it right in front of ya
That’s how I know, I cook it
Man these hoes so crazy
Asking what I’m cooking
Cook it right in front of ya
That’s how I know, I cook it
Cook, cook, chef
Wrist (skrt), whip (bricks)
Cook, cook, chef
Wrist (skrt), whip (bricks)
Cook, cook, chef
Wrist (skrt), whip (bricks)
Cook, cook, chef
Wrist (skrt), whip (bricks)

[Verse 1: Shawty Lo]
She want to model baby
Forget minor baby
This Shawty baby
Shawty Lo, I do it B-I
I do it, do it
Shawty Lo, I do it B-I
Man my ho just walked in
Asking what I’m cooking
Sit your ass in the living room
And stay out my kitchen
Country boys want two things
Got one left, watch me do things
Wrist game wax on wax off
Chop blocks like sensei
Don’t mix me with that rap shit
Ain’t nothing but some he say
I run my city
Whole town do what I say

[Hook: Shawty Lo]
Man these hoes be tripping
Asking what I’m cooking
Cook it right in front of ya
That’s how I know, I cook it
Man these hoes so crazy
Asking what I’m cooking
Cook it right in front of ya
That’s how I know, I cook it
Cook, cook, chef
Wrist (skrt), whip (bricks)
Cook, cook, chef
Wrist (skrt), whip (bricks)
Cook, cook, chef
Wrist (skrt), whip (bricks)
Cook, cook, chef
Wrist (skrt), whip (bricks)

[Verse 2: Yung Ralph]
In the kitchen whipping up like a chef
In the game calling plays like a ref
Fuck her good, eat it up, it’s top shelf
Don’t leave the trap ‘til it ain’t none’ left
Need some extra hands, all the money that we counting
All these diamonds on me, you can call me water fountain
Nigga cop a coupe, same day going mounting
Good with them digits, I don’t need no accountant
And they know a nigga represent the three like Curry
OG money, whip it in a circle like skerr
And they know everything Gucci on me like burr
[?] McGee, I’ma need a chauffer
West side, Ocean Drive, screaming out “Dey Know”
Dead man got me seeing stars like fable
A nigga moving slow, just poured a four in a Faygo
*2 Federal*, bumping Moneybagg Yayo
Still made the juggs off the bag like Shawty
Rollie on my wrist costs forty (thousand)
Just spend twenty on an old school
Same thing I spent on lil shawty
Trap money, it ain’t none’ but trap money
Benihana lunch with the cap money
Rest in peace my nigga Shawty L-O
Switch it all up, told her rap money, jugg
