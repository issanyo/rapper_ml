[Verse 1]
It was a typical mornin'
I'm yawnin' cause I'm horny
Off in Magic City star studded on a Monday
Valet cost a hundred
It don't really matter cause I'm gettin' to the money
I'm the man now who want it
Y'all makin' it rain but the kid got it stormin'
Well gotdamn Lo give it to 'em
A hundred thousand bissh I'm finna do it, do it
I'm a freak, I like to see the girls do it
I still got em for the L-O
17 5 all you gotta do it holl-O
Remember '96 burnt orange Monte Carlo

[Chorus]
Dope boys got them girls gone wild (gone wild)
Well gotdamn I done found my style (I done found my style)
I done found my swag (found my swag)
You can nip it in the bud, you can put it in the bag (in the bag)
Dope boys let's get get get it, get it
Let's get get get it
Ay, let's get get get it
Rep where you from if you get get get it
Dope boys got them girls gone wild (gone wild)
Well gotdamn I done found my style (I done found my style)
I done found my swag (found my swag)
You can nip it in the bud, you can put it in the bag (in the bag)

[Verse 2]
K-I N-G S-N A-P
Nope betcha can't do it like me, yep y'all some wannabes
You pussy niggas better getcha weight up
Push weight and I ain't never did a push-up
Only thang I did was lit a fork and did the cookup
Learned the recipe had the city in trouble
Yeah I already had muscle
Now I'm sittin' back and I'm watchin' money double
It's no secret I'm on the rise
I crossed the game over like Allen Iv
Why work a 9 to 5?
Fuck witcha boy get a 9 for 5

[Chorus]
Dope boys got them girls gone wild (gone wild)
Well gotdamn I done found my style (I done found my style)
I done found my swag (found my swag)
You can nip it in the bud, you can put it in the bag (in the bag)
