[Intro: Shawty Lo]
Yeah
Number two, number three, nobody remembers
Hashtag number one, champion
Shawty

[Hook: Shawty Lo]
I’m the don
Couldn’t be done
Number one
Champion
No excuse
I refuse
I will not lose
Champion, champion
Champion, champion
Champion
Number one
I will not lose

[Verse 1: Shawty Lo]
Fighting made me
Money made me
Holiday, May Day
All for one, one for all
Number one, champion
I’m the greatest like Muhammed Ali
Float like a butterfly, sting like a bee
It’s your time, no excuse
It’s your time, pay per view

[Hook: Shawty Lo]
I’m the don
Couldn’t be done
Number one
Champion
No excuse
I refuse
I will not lose
Champion, champion
Champion, champion
Champion
Number one
I will not lose

[Verse 2: Quando]
Mama made me
Daddy raised me
Nineties baby
The fork with gravy
They tryna slave us
But I’m the master
Bankhead
Another chapter
I miss ya papa
My daddy gone
Long live the king
I carry the throne
Do it with a passion and that’s to the last breath of me
Sixteen summers and they still ain’t learned the recipe
Thirty-six five, my nigga still play piano keys
Boy ain’t home forever, nigga still play them backstreets
Floyd Mayweather fly
Yeah I got them racks on me
Built Not Bought
We an empire, not a faculty

[Hook: Shawty Lo]
I’m the don
Couldn’t be done
Number one
Champion
No excuse
I refuse
I will not lose
Champion, champion, champion, champion
Champion
Number one
I will not lose
