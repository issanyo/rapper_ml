Ey ey I tell her...
Get it girl, keep that motor running
She poked that thing out like her name was Pocahontas
Shawty look half Indian and never say a thing
'Til I pull that wallet out and wa-wave it in her face
She be like...
I can make it rain (X8)

[Shawty Lo]
New school, old school outside
Fuck high school, motherfucker I'm high
L-O, I'm like whoa kemosabe
50,000 ones before I hit the lobby
I can make it rain
Money ain't a thing
She's a sex chaser, do whatever for the change
Well do the hokey-pokey, and turn that ass around
Up and down, up and down, bounce that ass up and down
Get up, get, get, get down (X2)
I'm popping rubber bands
She do it with no hands
Big shit popping, I'm the man

Yessir... momma looking Puerto Rican and she got the best hair
Come on over to the scene, grab a table, let me take a look at that there
Turn it upside down and open your legs if you're real cold
I'mma punt the paper over the pussy like a field goal
Touchdown, fatty super swole
The way that she got me throwing money she about to win the Super Bowl
And you know I keep it coming cause I get it with the rhythm and I get it on the block
Vroom vroom, keep the motor running girl, you know it don't stop
When she bounce that, when she shake that, when she work that
I'mma throw another hundred when she pop that, and she drop that, and she twork that
I'mma throw another hundred when she go and do it for my nigga Shawty Lo
And when you do it all they wanna know is how low you would go
Show me how you work it from the top to the bottom of the pole

Yea, strippers get excited when I get up in this ho
Got that Silkk The Shocker swipe, ain't No Limit on this ho
Ain't no gimmick with the flow
Ain't no women at the shows
When I be speaking they be geekin' like I'm giving bitches dope
Yea, DC boy today I'm out the stadium with dollars
Make the pussy talk, well I'mma make that pussy holler
We up in that Magic City throwing up them dollars
Now we up in that Magic City make it rain, viola
My apologies, let me give you acknowledgement
No, no this ain't tricking I'm simply giving them scholarships
Uh, red bottoms and a thong
Pay a whole semester in a motherfucking song
