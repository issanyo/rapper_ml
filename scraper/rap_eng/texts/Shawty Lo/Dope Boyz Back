Ey this is weezing
And if I don't make it back
I'm fleexing with the racks
My money's on the shed
Money for the fam'
But I can make it back
In case it's just an ample
The dope boys are back
The dope boys back
The dope boys are back
The dope boys back
The dope boys are back
The dope boys back
The dope boys are back
And this is just an ample
The dope boys are back
The dope boys back

[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]
It's Gucci Mane and Lo we still got it for the lo lo
Ballin'yo on the mo mo, we back to back in lambo
I don't bother that the boy I got
More cars than a car lot
I'm a hot boy with a cold wife
Make the girls wet, show the whole junk
White ones with no something
White rhymers with no talk
They ludacris and born home
So you know that we got more shot
Everybody love a d-boy
Old's school for the tic tac
No whities for the rebunds
To rerocking a free blunt
It's Gucci Mane and Lo we still got it for the LO
Got a dope game and a choco
Price so low I been a deep stone
Ludacris and flesh shows
You can call me Ayo
And the J could get 50 Cent
Our sirens could say the mojo

Ey this is weezing
And if I don't make it back
I'm fleexing with the racks

But I can make it back
In case it's just an ample
The dope boys are back
The dope boys back
The dope boys are back
The dope boys back
The dope boys are back
The dope boys back
The dope boys are back
And this is just an ample
The dope boys are back
The dope boys back

[Verse 2: Shawty Lo]
Ey, Shawt Lo, Guccy, everything, Gucci
Still rocking the MV
Be real bum, they envy

In 45 get your twenty
One fourth of the hugh blow
We singing on lambo
Mocking nigga like can't go
Bake it nigga be cycle
Bitch keep happening on air low
Remember white girls
Say nigga why you turned back
I'm back like I've been gone
They torn down my pride checks

Daddy boy, tough strong
Won't be long before they gone
So what, song 6

You know all my dope boyz put your fucks in the air
