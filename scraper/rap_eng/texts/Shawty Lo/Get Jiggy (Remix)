[Verse 1: Yung Ralph]
I pull up at the mall and spend gwap on clothes
Then I hit Strokers and spend gwap on hoes
What the Hell I care? I get gwap from my shows
Drop my earring in my Goose just to make my drink cold
I remember me and mama used to shop at Target
Now we getting jiggy, shopping in these mini-markets
Yung Ralph, ATM, Parlae, we get that paper
Catch us in the club, getting jiggy on them haters

[Verse 2: Selfmade]
My swag off the chain, these hoes all on me
Cheddar cheese diamonds, I call it macaroni
Money out the ass, and I got diarrhea
Shitting on these haters and I got diarrhea
Ugh! Count so much money that my hands hurt
Stacks to the ceiling, money trying to stand up
It's young, rich [?], worth a couple of million
I grind, I hustle all the time, my nigga, I get jiggy

[Verse 3: Parlae]
My chain game swing, my chain hang low
I'm getting jiggy, man, my hand swing low
And I look like money, swag like money
Way before the deal, you can tell I had money
Stacks in my pockets, got them looking like thigh pads
On that bubble kush, eyes looking like the Triads
All them other songs, I can't get jiggy with that shit
Don't want to remix and get jiggy on a bitch

[Verse 4: ATM]
I hit the VIP tipsy with a pound of that kush-y
Dressed flyer than a pigeon and swag is appealing
'Cause I look like money, talk like the same
Throw a stack in the air, bet it look like rain
And I'm oh so fresh, ain't a damn thing changed
Remix, Yung Ralph and my nigga Parlae
Look them hoes in their face, tell them, "Man, I'm a stunner
Fuck with a player, baby, I'm doing numbers"

[Verse 5: Shawty Lo]
Hold up, hold on, let the man in this bitch
Bankhead in this bitch, Zone 1 to Zone 6
Getting jiggy in this bitch, Shawty Lo in this bitch
And I'm tipsy, I'm leaning, I'm rolling, I'm horny
Gangsta Grillz productions in my ear, man, they blowing it
I'm high as a four-four, looking for that low-low
And she can go with me and get jiggy if she want to
Remix
