[Hook: Shawty Lo]
We getting money right here, y'all niggas need help
I spin the fork with the right, lean the pot with the left
Hey, nope! You can't do what we do
'Cause real street niggas, make it do what it do

[Verse 1: Shawty Lo]
I'm Shawty L-O, got them for the L-O
Twist the ice up, rock the blue and the yellow
I still live in the ghetto, doing my thing
Got the blas√©, whoopty whoops and the chicken wings
They finger-licking good, I'm sitting on the throne
Everybody know it's real, who's the man from Bowen Homes?
(Bitch, I'm the man, I, I, I'm the man)
Just last week, sold fifty of my girlfriend
Yeah, I'm a pimp, I work them hoes
She got the deuces, he got the fours
So you knew about the base, then
Got no wife, but the white be my girlfriend

[Hook (2x): Shawty Lo]
We getting money right here, y'all niggas need help
I spin the fork with the right, lean the pot with the left
Hey, nope! You can't do what we do
'Cause real street niggas, make it do what it do

[Verse 2: Lil Mark]
I make that crackwork jump each and every day
And I make the block bump, bump like B2K
I cook the yay, they serve the grams
I fuck with Lo, 'cause he the man
Patty cake, patty cake, baker's man
Whip it up, sell them hoes as fast as I can
Yep, and I'm for real, you can check my resume
Made ten stacks easy on my off day
I get off yay, nah, I ain't playing with it
Ding, ding, ding, dinner's ready, so they come and get it
Five bricks, one day, yeah, I ran through it
Money ain't a thing 'cause you know the kid used to it

[Hook: Shawty Lo]
We getting money right here, y'all niggas need help
I spin the fork with the right, lean the pot with the left
Hey, nope! You can't do what we do
'Cause real street niggas, make it do what it do
