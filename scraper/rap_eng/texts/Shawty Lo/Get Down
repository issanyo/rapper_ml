[Verse]
Let's keep it pimping, I'm the player of the game
Fuck the fame, street nigga, been doing my thing
I see the kids stay in the mix of things
I'm a two-time felon, but I keep that thing
I'm the last man standing, I survived the game
Wish I could say the same for these suckers and lames
I born a hustler, got a mean wrist game
Been the man ever since I hooked with cane
Took aim, I'm cain, or whatever they call me
And you can get it, too, whenever you call me
I've been getting money, C.E.O., D4L
Records, we a army

[Hook]
They say they like my sound
It make them get up, get, get, get down
Get up, get, get, get down
Get up, get, get, get down
They say they like my sound
It make them get up, get, get, get down
Get up, get, get, get down
Get up, get, get, get down
