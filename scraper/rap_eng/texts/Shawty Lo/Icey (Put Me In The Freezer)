[Verse 1: Baby D]
Its baby D, Gucci shawty low we gotta be a hit
I walk up in the club chain hangin to my dick
I know that im the shit, so haters start talkin down on me
Keep a full pound on me so keep em down homie
Bout a half a mill on me look at my wrist
The whole interstar dont shine like this
Bitch im rich gotta iglu watch
Put me in the freezer, cuz im so hot
Im so icy from my head to my feet
That i dont ride, i glide down the streets
These chains ain't cheap, these rangs ain't cheap
Ain't talkin bout money shawty then dont speak
Put me in the freezer right next to the beef

Take your shades down then you can clearly see
That everybody in the A icey like me!

[Verse 2: Gucci Mane]

The opposite of big clay cousins will dro
Money price high, Gucci price low
Chain hang low cuz Gucci said so
If a hater see my chain then you know he wanna fight me
First still change the party dawg let’s bring em to the light
Oh no Gucci mane, bout to steal their girl
Wit the blue n white chain it could change the whole world
Ima ice yo see the light show
Club night club right Gucci shining hella bright
Grey stones red stones yellow lights finger ring so bright

When you get money, you can do whatever
Slashes on my face I can see a little better

[Chorus: Baby D]
