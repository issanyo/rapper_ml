[Chorus]
Turn it up on these punk ass hoes
Turn it up on these punk ass hoes
Turn, turn it up on these punk ass hoes
Turn it up on, turn, turn it up
Turn it up, turn it up
Turn it up, turn it up
Turn it up on these punk ass hoes
Turn, turn it up on these punk ass hoes

[Verse 1: Lil Mark]
Turn it up on these punk ass hoes
Spitting game from coast to coast
Lame hoes hate me the most
I got the right to brag and boast
What you know about yachts and boats?
[?] we're off the coast
No more playing, I'ma coast
They say he's arrogant, of course
Let me clear my voice
Fuck with me, he ain't got no choice
Raw report shawty
Got extra money, ask your source
Bitch, what? Small fee?
Charge who? Not me
What I look like, paying for the pussy
When I'm giving you the dick for free?

[Chorus]
Turn it up on these punk ass hoes
Turn it up on these punk ass hoes
Turn, turn it up on these punk ass hoes
Turn it up on, turn, turn it up
Turn it up, turn it up
Turn it up, turn it up
Turn it up on these punk ass hoes
Turn, turn it up on these punk ass hoes

[Verse 2: Mook-B]
Turn it up on a punk ass hoe
Show her something she never seen before
Islands in other countries
Bitch, you can't do nothing but want me
Usually, I don't this shit
I'ma turn it up on a punk ass bitch
Slide on these Gucci shoes
87 jeans, I'm looking so cool
Mook-B is in this bitch
Tonight the night I'm finna show you I'm rich
Valet my European whip
VIP line is where I went
No waiting and no check in
This space ready, that I rent?
'Cause me and the crew here to do this shit
Buying bottles, spit game at bitches

[Chorus]
Turn it up on these punk ass hoes
Turn it up on these punk ass hoes
Turn, turn it up on these punk ass hoes
Turn it up on, turn, turn it up
Turn it up, turn it up
Turn it up, turn it up
Turn it up on these punk ass hoes
Turn, turn it up on these punk ass hoes
