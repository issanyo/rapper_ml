[Verse 1: Fabo]
Shawty keep real good blow
Found him on the new [?] down in Bankhead [?]
He the dopeman, yeah, they call him "Two-for-Five Shawty"
Moved up, Atlanta name, don't get high and keep your forty
You don't know him like the J's in the trap, it ain't just a rap
Shawty keep that thing in his lap, quick to bust a cap
Plan big moves, always know what's going on
He connected like all of his cousins down at Bowen Homes

[Verse 2: Shawty Lo]
I don't know what y'all been told
Shawty Lo, back on the map, what's up, that's what's happenin'
And you know I keep work
Seventeen five, same color T-shirt, so what's happenin'
I'm the man, bitch, I'm the man
Got no wife, but the white be my girlfriend
I'm hustling, got units in the city
If you want it, come and get it, work

[Verse 3: Stuntman]
Freshest nigga you've ever seen, been [?] triple beam
Now you never scared to [?] and shoot a M-16
Man, I know how to flip my dough, Lo showed me how to stretch the blow
Plus I got a connect in Arizona and that Mexico
Been for the low, Malcolm X still hitting my twerk
Stuntman [?], so Stuntman got the work
I ain't scared to die, you know I've been trained to go
So keep it on the low, nobody got to know

[Verse 4: Mook-B]
Stunt and Lo in the kitchen, cooking up chickens
Me and Fabo at the table, picking collard greens
Lil Mark, pass the crew the plates 'cause it's time to eat
Can't forget about the pot with that colorful beans
You feening, we got it, them besos, they clocking
Posted under the tree, ain't no motherfucking stopping
Po-po's, they watching, watch out, they spotting
We ain't never slipping, they rush us, we dipping

[Hook: Shawty Lo]
Bitch, I'm the man, I, I, I'm the man
Got no wife, but the white be my girlfriend
Got, got no wife, but the white be my girl...
Got, got no wife, but the white be my girlfriend
Bitch, I'm the man, I, I, I'm the man
Got no wife, but the white be my girlfriend
Bitch, I'm the man, I, I, I'm the man
I, I'm the man, I, I, I'm the man
Bitch, I'm the man, I, I, I'm the man
Got no wife, but the white be my girlfriend
Got, got no wife, but the white be my girl...
Got, got no wife, but the white be my girlfriend
