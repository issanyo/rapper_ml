[Verse 1: Soulja Boy]
It's Soulja Boy Tellem, I rap with Shawty Lo
I got so much snow, Gucci head to toe
Chain on chill (chilly), watch on freeze (freeze)
So much ice I got you looking like Chinese
Gucci shades but they still can't hide me
I hit the club, eighteen with no ID
Uhh! I change up the format
Welcome to my crib, leave your shoes at the doormat
Uhh, and ain't this beat tight?
My chains say hello, my watch say goodbye
And I still look right, this is the good life
This Gucci Bandanna it just make me look tight

[Gucci Mane:]
Gucci Bandanna, call me Gucci Montana
Gucci girl with me, Gucci bag, Gucci sandals
She too hot to handle, hot sex, burning candles
Gucci Mane la flare, Gucci shopping this extravagant
Gucci Mane drive a drop top red Phantom
And my bed got them super size Gucci spreads
Pull up to the hood stop and let them jock Gucci
Broads jock Gucci, cause Gucci, just Gucci
Yeah my boxer briefs equipped with double G's
Gucci key chain holding for my Gucci keys
Gucci down all the time in the summer time
I'm Gucci Mane, you would think that was my clothing line
Gucci!

[Shawty Lo:]
Shawty Lo, I really run Atlanta
Scarf 'round my neck, Gucci Bandanna
Haters talking slick, they filled with ana
But I don't care so god damn ya
This big ass watch costs more than yours
I built a house you can't afford
It's stupid big, got an ocean view
It's way up there, I look down on you
We flex down here, that's what we do
Get in my way, I flex on you
You acting monkey, we keep bannanas
Keep them goons with me, Gucci bandanna
Scarf 'round my neck, Gucci Bandanna
