[Chorus: Gucci Mane]
Huh, huh
All-white bricks
Off-white bricks
Ay, Holiday, Juiceman
Light-tan bricks
Ah man you got everyone on this one, cuz, this the remix
Juiceman gon' start this one off though, lets go
Just hit a lick for fifty more bricks
Balling like a bitch with all these bricks
Bricks!
Thirty-six zips
DJ Holiday, this is for the streets, Fabulous, Shawty Lo 8Ball and MJG
That's a whole chick
Want a bad bitch? Gotta have bricks
Yeah that makes sense
Yeah, I make hits
But I still take bricks

[Verse 1: OJ da Juiceman]
Brick, hundred fifty bricks man
Young Juiceman with my bricks out the trash can
White baby, tan baby, no I'm not a gravy baby
We started in Georgia, pappin', young Juice, '98
Right wrist real retarded, dawg, right hand just replaced the J
Bust it, break it down, now Juiceman got the stupid [?]
Twerkin' fifty bricks now left wrist switched like the Lakers
Catch me in my Hummer and I'm taller than a damn glacier
Pinky ring, forty stacks, bought it with that con back
All these, just a gram, got my diamonds just like jumping jacks
Young Juiceman, God damn, you boomin'
All these bricks in, I ain't blow in the movies

[Chorus: Gucci Mane]
Bricks!
All-white bricks
Off-white bricks
Light-tan bricks
Just hit a lick for fifty more bricks
Balling like a bitch with all these bricks
Bricks!

[Verse 2: Fabulous]
Chickens came through, all white me
It's time to kill these hoes, get the white sheets
Back seat bricks, chauffeur drippin'
Now there's birds on the table, happy Thanksgiving
Daddy do the duffel, shorty do the speed
Big first week numbers, I ain't sell a CD
We flip squares, welcome to White Castle
She say I'm ballin' like a bitch, ho, did I ask you?
He's low, so, 'case you didn't know so
If you don't you know now
They should call me snow plow
All white, just like, but you know I took ten
These gon' go for double when I get 'em back to Brooklyn

[Chorus: Gucci Mane]
Bricks!
All-white bricks
Off-white bricks
Light-tan bricks
Just hit a lick for fifty more bricks
Balling like a bitch with all these bricks
Bricks!
Thirty-six zips
That's a whole chick
Want a bad bitch? Gotta have bricks
Yeah that makes sense
Yeah, I make hits
But I still take bricks

[Verse 3: 8Ball & MJG]
I'm wrapped up in all dirty types of shit, so
This the dirty game, give me thirty six domes
I'm tight, MJ with the big foams
Four cock backs, baby tryna get more
You don't know about the pistol on the [?]
You try to catch me slippin', make me try to pop a ho
Stupid nigga, try to catch me on the smooth creek
You know I'd never keep nothin' where a nigga sleeps
That's where you gotta eat, where everything is sweet
You Dwayne Wade? You wanna bring the heat?
Bricks on the block, bricks in the trap
And when you ridin' keep a couple bricks in your lap
Don't get your feelings hurt thinkin' this is just a rap
You heard- you know where they do that at
Bitches love money, niggas make money
You not a hustler, motherfucker, you a crash dummy

[Chorus: Gucci Mane]
Bricks!
All-white bricks
Off-white bricks
Light-tan bricks
Just hit a lick for fifty more bricks
Balling like a bitch with all these bricks
Bricks!

[Verse 4: Shawty Lo]
All-white bricks, off-white bricks
At the bay, switch J's, so hood rich
Like ten bricks, sold 'em ASAP
To my Carolina boys, made a full cap
Ay, bricks like [?]
Beat the work up like I beat Tina
Nigga fly as hell
Got the thing swimming like Michael Phelps
Ay, and I don't need no medal
Chain so big, it's the size of your kid
Dun, dun, dun, done what you did
You ain't man like me and Gucci, servin' ya bricks

[Chorus: Gucci Mane]
Bricks!
All-white bricks
Off-white bricks
Light-tan bricks
Just hit a lick for fifty more bricks
Balling like a bitch with all these bricks
Bricks!
Yeah
Thirty-six zips
That's a whole chick
Want a bad bitch? Gotta have bricks
Yeah that makes sense
Yeah, I make hits
But I still take bricks
