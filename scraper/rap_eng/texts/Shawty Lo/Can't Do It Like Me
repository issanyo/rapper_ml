Testing, one, two, three
Nah, you can't do it like me
You can't do it like me, can't do it like me
You can't do it like me, can't do it like me
You can't do it like me, can't do it like me
You can't do it like me, can't do it like me

[Verse 1]
Hell, no, you can't do it like me
The kid's stay real pimpish, I'm a sight to see
I remember around the time I was riding a fleet
When the cops got behind me and I had to flee
Riding dirty with no license and plenty of weed
And the rap police snapping pictures of me

Nah, you can't do it like me
You can't do it like me, can't do it like me
You can't do it like me, can't do it like me
You can't do it like me, can't do it like me
You can't do it like me, can't do it like me

[Verse 2]
Nope, you can't do it like me
Shawty Lo shit, nigga, yeah, brick I [?]
Ain't enough paper that can wipe my ass
My shit's green, son, you can't count my cash
Niggas bad, they say that I came up fast
But if I didn't, cats was gonna feel my wrath
Shawty Lo, CEO, nigga, fuck the [?]
Got gas full of cash, y'all can kiss my ass

Testing, one, two, three
Nah, you can't do it like me

You can't do it like me, can't do it like me
