[Verse: Shawty Lo]
Shawty Lo, yeah, hoe, you can call me boss, hoe
Fifty-thousand feet up, looking out the window
Yeah, that's a G4, just left the West Coast
Got a couple Pintos, yeah, Lo problems
Real supermodels, yeah, I'll start them
Couple gold bottles, fed them little lobster
Dessert, no cobbler, bitch got problems
Shawty, I solve them, it's no problem
The world still revolving, Shawty Lo balling
Bankhead

[Hook (4x)]
Louie V bag be, that's where the cash be
Jeans stay sagging, million dollar mouthpiece
