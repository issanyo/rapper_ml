Bankhead, nigga, seated in the head lounge
Bank, Bank, ba-Bankhead nigga
Bank, Ba-Bank, Ba-Bankhead, nigga
Bank, Ba-Bank, Ba-Bankhead, nigga
Bankhead, nigga, Ba-Bankhead nigga
Bankhead, nigga, seated in the head lounge
Miracle smoke strong and I did it with a Tec, now
Bankhead, nigga, seated in the head lounge
Miracle smoke strong and I did it with a Tec, now

[Verse: Shawty Lo]
Who mention Bankhead, then deny that's me
What, you blind? Need glasses to see?
You got a deal, still ain't rocking more ice than me
I thought you would have been more nice than me
You ain't seen more stacks in life than me
'Cause your stacks just a bite to me, so be polite to me
'Cause when you see me, I'm a sight to see

Bankhead
Bank-Bank-Bankhead
Bankhead, nigga, seated in the head lounge...
