Man, I didn't even make me the man, man
The hood, the streets made me the man, you know what I'm saying?
I just did what I did, man, you know what I'm saying?
Niggas was calling me, like...
You had niggas calling me "King"
You had niggas calling me "Frank White"
Niggas saluting me, calling me the colonel
Shit, you know...
The title must mean something, I don't...
They just gave it to me
