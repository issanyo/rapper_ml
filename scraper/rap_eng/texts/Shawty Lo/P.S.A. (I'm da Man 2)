Niggas can't mention this shit
It, it's impossible
Nothing, nada
How can you mention Bankhead and Shawty Lo in the rap game?
Just because we brought up D4L from that, like, you know what I'm saying
Like, the little snap shit, you know what I'm saying
Like, that shit wasn't planned to happened like that, or whatever
When I first started, nigga, I was in jail when...
When the shit really, like, jumped off, before I got out of jail
You know what I'm saying?
That kind of shit, I had to roll the flow, nigga
I'm trying to get my money
You know what I'm saying, what was I supposed to do?
I'm trying to get my money
So niggas had it fucked up or confused, know what I'm saying?
I wasn't a rapper, I was just on a couples of verses, doing this, you know what I'm saying?
But, shit, once I sat down and doing the math of this shit
Looking at these niggas where they first started a couple years ago and where these niggas at
And they started rapping about me
And then we got they folks, they own people
Saying, goddamn, "I don't know he ain't who he is
He need to, goddamn, you know what I'm saying, why he just..."
Nigga, nigga talking that shit
Nigga, this L-O
Nigga, I'm on Bankhead, this my shit
Nigga, how you gon' mention this shit without me?
