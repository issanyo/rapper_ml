People gon' talk, that's what they do
When you on top, they gon' hate on you

[Verse 1: Shawty Lo]
To be the talk of the town
You gotta walk that walk
And you gotta stay down, stay down nigga
On the head, all the sodium
I'm at bay reach on the low
Gonna have it now

Ground me bitch

I thought I told you let me show you what the dice at
Let me role it, live
I'm a addicted to the money, I have money I get money
Do you hear me, ey
Yeah bitch, I'm shawty Lo if you didn't know

[Verse 2: 50 Cent]
I'm the ninety vet, I'm the sinner attraction
Everytime I come around and slice camera action
I'm the talk of the town and when they talk about it
Getting more bread, I mean more bread
I love this girl in this dream about a chocolate beam
I mean like everywhere I go a nigga cause a scene
I let the hater keep breathing
I watch him when I keep winning
I think I'm meant to be on top from the beginning
That nigga wise the shine, time after time
You didn't know where up her gas or pop an arm
No joke front this low flow
So don't I'm a stay paid
I just fight with the guns, I let you move an ounce
What you have in your head, it's the dope boy sound
Gotta handle the habit, that money I gotta have it
So I be bouncing the heart, yes I be the F
Stand tough and you lovin' me
You be humming bird, can't fuck with the style that I got
Go ahead, press the one play it one more time
50 Cent damn I'm hot
