[Intro]
Hey
It's the greatest show on earth, man
Shawty L-O, man
Bigger than Ringling Bros
Bring your top hat
Hey

[Chorus]
L-O, L-O, they know, they know
L-O, L-O, they know, they know
L-O, L-O, they know, they know
L-O, L-O, they know, they know

[Verse 1]
Shawty Lo, I got flavor
Lets you know the kid got paper
Like 40, don't save her
Bankhead, been pulling capers
The way you drop would have thought I had a taser
Call me street like a razor
Shawty Lo, ATL, I'm the mayor
Street nigga, but my gear be tailor
Every day and then, shawty might rock gators
Millionaire plus I got acres
Yeah, no more nosy-ass neighbors
Big ups to all my haters

[Chorus]
L-O, L-O, they know, they know
L-O, L-O, they know, they know
L-O, L-O, they know, they know
Rep where you from if you get, get, get it

[Verse 2]
I'm the man and they know that
I got cash, I'm talking throwback
A hundred grand, what's that?
I hit club and I blow that
All these hoes know Lo that
I'm picture perfect, made for Kodak
Let's talk money, I got plenty
Dope boys let's get, get, get it

[Chorus]
L-O, L-O, they know, they know
L-O, L-O, they know, they know
L-O, L-O, they know, they know
Rep where you from, if you get, get, get it
L-O, L-O, they know, they know
L-O, L-O, they know, they know
L-O, L-O, they know, they know
Rep where you from, if you get, get, get it

[Verse 3]
Hey, hey, hey, hey, how you doing? It's L-O
You said they see three, I'm the one in the middle
And I don't need this beat, I could rock it acapello
Pop one, pop two, all I needed was some skittles
Yeah, now I'm geeked
Screaming, "Yes, sir", just like G
A-Town fitted, who but me
L-O, she know, he know, they know, I am

[Chorus]
L-O, L-O, they know, they know
L-O, L-O, they know, they know
L-O, L-O, they know, they know
Rep where you from, if you get, get, get it

[Outro]
They know, they know
They know, they know
They know, they know
