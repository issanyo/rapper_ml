[Verse 1]
Ten years, ten reasons
Wanna hear the rest? served one year in prison
I couldn’t sleep
I was steady fighting my demons
I gotta thank god that the kid still breathing, yeah
The eight [?], I call it home
Streets behind me, I don’t stand alone
Free big danny but my nigga touched grown
Fast [?] my nigga [?] I’m from goin’ home
Thought it wasn’t no competition
But my show, they wanna sign petitions
Yeah, they wanna see Shawty broke
Why? ‘cause I really sold dope

Shawty, but they call me Shawty Lo
Bankhead king, you can ask JoJo
I do it, I’m a bad motherfucker
Three stack eleven, I can make it at the buzzer
I ain’t have shit, my life was rough
Barely had food, no toys for us
Line at PlayWorld, no Toys R Us
I’m talking Bankhead coke nigga, to the bluff
I’d rather lose a loved one than love a loser
Young hoes only, I don’t fuck with cougars
Yadda yadda yadda, it’s all he say
You can hate me, I like cash any way
