[Chorus: Stuntman & Shawty Lo]
Stuntman, bitch, 17-5, you know I got them
Buy four or more on my spot, you can drop them
I ain't flexing, I'm a kingpin
Well, goddamn, Stunt, give it to them

[Verse 1: Stuntman]
My rims still spin, man, I'm sitting tall
Why these haters wanna see the Stuntman fall?
I'm something like the WIC man, nah, I'm the brick man
Seventeen five for a whole, get it in, man
These niggas don't know about that, I don't think they hear my rap
They don't know how to make no caps, how me and Lo run them traps
The base stays, man, they did numbers
Ran through plenty bricks, man, in one summer
I'm for real nigga, I'm a kingpin
Peep the ice on the wrist, twenty-six ten
Don't forget my neck 'cause you know it glow
That's the sign of a nigga who got plenty dough

[Chorus: Stuntman & Shawty Lo]
Stuntman, bitch, 17-5, you know I got them
Buy four or more on my spot, you can drop them
I ain't flexing, I'm a kingpin
Well, goddamn, Stunt, give it to them
Stuntman, bitch, 17-5, you know I got them
Buy four or more on my spot, you can drop them
I ain't flexing, I'm a kingpin
Well, goddamn, Stunt, give it to them

[Verse 2: Stuntman]
Have you even seen it bust up out the wrap?
Duct tape on top, underneath the Saran wrap
That's what I did, I'm the main man
Never change, stay loyal to you, I'm the same, man
I love that shit, God knows I earned the shit
I had to be rich, [?] like fuck that shit
Got a deal now, I still should've chilled, now
Feel like [?], fuck how you feel now

[Chorus: Stuntman & Shawty Lo]
Stuntman, bitch, 17-5, you know I got them
Buy four or more on my spot, you can drop them
I ain't flexing, I'm a kingpin
Well, goddamn, Stunt, give it to them
Stuntman, bitch, 17-5, you know I got them
Buy four or more on my spot, you can drop them
I ain't flexing, I'm a kingpin
Well, goddamn, Stunt, give it to them

[Verse 3: Shawty Lo]
Swear to God, man, I ain't no rapper
I just kill them with the slow flow
Getting paid to tell my adventures
(This is based on a true story)
My life
This is not a movie, it's my life
Twenty-eight arrests, got four convictions
Now I'm doing shows at big conventions
My goal quick, so all my weight [?]
Twelve for a deuce, that's twelve for a walkthrough
This Pimpin', I stay Jizzal
Bring your Buddies and let's Parlae
Y'all know what this is

[Chorus: Stuntman & Shawty Lo]
Stuntman, bitch, 17-5, you know I got them
Buy four or more on my spot, you can drop them
I ain't flexing, I'm a kingpin
Well, goddamn, Stunt, give it to them
Stuntman, bitch, 17-5, you know I got them
Buy four or more on my spot, you can drop them
I ain't flexing, I'm a kingpin
Well, goddamn, Stunt, give it to them
