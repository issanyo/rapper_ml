[Verse]
Big dog, yeah that's me
I'm the big underdog of the industry
I'm a hustler, shit I'm Bankhead fine
I'm a real d-boy and I'm the d-boy rhyming
Big d-boy grinding, see these d-boy diamonds
You will never be the d-boy I am

[Hook]
L-O, I've been around the world and back
I'm here now and ain't no turning me back
L-O, I've been around the world and back
I'm here now and ain't no turning me back
L-O, I've been around the world and back
I'm here now and ain't no turning me back
L-O, I've been around the world and back
I'm here now and ain't no turning me back
