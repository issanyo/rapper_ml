[Chorus: Shawty Lo]
Bitch I'm the man, I, I, I'm the man
Got no wife but the white be my girlfriend
Got no wife but the white be my girl...
Got, got, no wife but the white be my girlfriend

[Verse 1: Shawty Lo]
I don't know what y'all been told
Shawty Lo back on the map, what's up
That's what's hannenin'
And you know I keep work
Seventeen five, same color t-shirt
What's hannenin'
I'm the man
Bitch I'm the man
Got no wife but the white be my girlfriend
I'm hustlin'
Got units in the city
If you want it come and get it (ha ha)
Work (whoa)

[Chorus: Shawty Lo]
Bitch I'm the man
I, I, I'm the man
Got no wife but the white be my girlfriend
G-got no wife but the white be my girl...
Got, got, no wife but the white be my girlfriend
Bitch I'm the man
I, I, I'm the man
Got no wife but the white be my girlfriend
Bitch I'm the man
I, I, I'm the man
I, I'm the man
I, I, I'm the man

[Verse 2: Shawty Lo]
Don't look suprised they can't hold me
I'm like oil base, I'm hard to lock up
You can't beat me, still hard to lock up
Hit the Westside I made them stand up
CEO, colonel, whatever they call me
Niggas gain weight
They obese
They done got fat
Its that time, Jenny Craig
Got that Shawty Lo crack
Whoa made them stop that
They don't want that
D4L made them suckas lean back, way back
’Cause I'm the man
Yeah, bitch I'm the man
Catch me in the club poppin' rubberbands ’cause I can
I like to stunt a lot
See me in the parking lot
645 a roof gone, yeah I dropped the top

[Chorus: Shawty Lo]
Bitch I'm the man
I, I, I'm the man
Got no wife but the white be my girlfriend
Bitch I'm the man
I, I, I'm the man
I, I'm the man
I, I, I'm the man
Bitch I'm the man
I, I, I'm the man
Got no wife but the white be my girlfriend
G-got no wife but the white be my girl...
Got, got, no wife but the white be my girlfriend

[Verse 3: Shawty Lo]
The cars, the hoes, the life I chose
The ice is froze, my flow is cold
I'm hot for sho', you know it's Lo
I been getting money way back in '94
The base, my trap, and you know it be on fire
D4L ain't gettin' money? That's a motherfuckin' lie
I already got money, can't you look at me dummy?
I'm laced head to toe, look at the way your ho chose
Bank roll unfold, I made it rain on them hoes
'04 four-door double-o on them hoes
Bubble kush I blow, leave the smell on your clothes
I'm gettin' money in the hood and they already know
Whoa!

[Chorus: Shawty Lo]
Bitch I'm the man
I, I, I'm the man
Got no wife but the white be my girlfriend
G-got no wife but the white be my girl...
Got, got, no wife but the white be my girlfriend
Bitch I'm the man
I, I, I'm the man
Got no wife but the white be my girlfriend
Bitch I'm the man
I, I, I'm the man
I, I'm the man
I, I, I'm the man
Bitch I'm the man
I, I, I'm the man
Got no wife but the white be my girlfriend
G-got no wife but the white be my girl...
Got, got, no wife but the white be my girlfriend
