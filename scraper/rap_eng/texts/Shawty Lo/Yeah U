[Intro]
Yeah U
They ain't U
Quite a few

[Verse 1 - Shawty Lo]
Girl you gotta going on why they hate you
I hate to say the L word but I mmmh you
Baby like when the bills Late
We overdue, I wanna put a ring on it, I swear I do
Mama said, judge no book by its cover
But shawty so bad she belong on the cover
She make her own money she don't ask me for shit
She got her own whip and she pay her own rent
I respect that shit, never knock a hustler
But she ain't had to lie like she work a 9 to 5
Since you had the flame then you try run and hide
And unlike them other guys girl, and shit ain't no surprise
Shawty so hood, shawty so street
Then she ain't never met a nigga like me
Shawty get low put it down on me
I'm Shawty L.O, L.O.V.E

[Hook]
Shawty u a bad bitch, yeah U
Don't worry about them other girls they ain't U
And she got a lot of bags, quite a few
Damn I had to sneeze oh her, bless U
Girl you got it going on, why they hate U
I hate to say the L word but I mmh you
Baby like when the bills late we over do
I wanna put the ring on it, I swear I do

[Verse 2 - Rich Homie Quan]
They say money come and go so get it when you can
I stack the hundreds on the floor, I count every single in my hand
I got bitches in every state, I'm plugged every city
I've been working all day, and it's all from tryin to get it
I'm talking bout that Pack they hate on me, can't mistaking this shit
I ain't riding in no jag girl, this a brand new benz what the fuck you would think
How the fuck you know that girl, told me double your friend that's a lot I can't believe
To the hood you can back there, Ooo
Why you lie like that? that's the main damn reason
Why you cry like that, I brighten your day make you smile like that
They H.I.G.H, high like that
Can't let a fuck nigga get by like that
Your personality to me no, me and shawty lo dun teamed up
Put a ring round your finger

[Bridge]
Girl you got it going on, why they hate U
I hate to say the L word but I mmh you
Baby like when the bills late we over do
I wanna put the ring on it, I swear I do

[Verse 3 - Plies]
Girl I wanna leave it to you, I swear I do
The first pussy I ever ate, it was you
Wanna see them titties swayin like grape fruit
Tryin to put that pussy on em, cur few
You said I knock your fear on period on, I try to
Every time I think about you, I want U
You said that I'm a freak baby, now that's true
I just wanna beat you good and land you
I don't know the name of you, your perfume
But every time I leave around you I still smell you
The way you call my name out, it's so cute
When they gave that good shit out they triple blast you

[Hook]
Shawty a bad bitch, yeah U

Baby like when the bills late we over do
I wanna put the ring on it, I swear I do
