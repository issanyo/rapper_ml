[Hook (2x)]
It feels good to be here
It feels good to be here
It feels good to be here
I must've done something right here, the kid right here

[Verse]
Ninety-three, my granny left me
So confused, my home is the streets
For although I chose to stand
I was like, "Damn what about me, and?"
A young teen forced to be, a grown man
Who idol was Michael Jordan, not a dopeman
"Dopeman, Dopeman", yeah, it's me
And ever since I heard that, yeah, that's me
A 9th grade dropout, got a rock at the park
Me and Kurt riding dirt, serving slims out the car
Dope boy fresh, man, I swear I was balling
Fit from Kel, got my kicks from Walter

It feels good to be here
It feels good to be here
It feels good to be here
I must've done something right here, the kid right here
