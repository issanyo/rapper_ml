[Verse: Shawty Lo]
[?] like the Carter, come and place your order
Serve fishscale, with a extra tartar
I drop it in the boiler, add a little water
Mix it with the soda, with it, made it harder
The trap's still bunking, the trap is steady moving
The folks still watching, but the money still moving
And nah, I ain't losing my girlfriend Susan
Made a lot of money, fuck all the hoes choosing
Whispered in my ear, "Shawty Lo, let's do it"
Got right to it, I know how to do it
Plus I'm getting money every time I bust a unit
Put it in the trap, watch the J's who would do it

[Hook: Yung Ralph]
My trap stay bunking, my trap stay booming
The folks steady watching, but the money still moving
My trap stay bunking, my trap stay booming
The folks steady watching, but the money still moving
What you doing? Nothing, nothing, nothing
What we doing? Nothing, nothing, nothing
And what they doing? Nothing, nothing, nothing
Aye, the folks still watching, but the trap still booming
