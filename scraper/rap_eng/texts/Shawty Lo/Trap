[Intelurde: Tadoe & Chief Keef]
I'm finna trap
Just got a whole brick of what's cracking
Finna break it down bitch lil magic
Tadoe? Damn, Tadoe, what the fuck?

[Verse 1: Chief Keef]
Aye, bitch, my wrist look like magic
In the trap, these bitches, they some maggots
They some lice all in my motherfucking hair
Bitch, you gotta get up out of here
'Cause I'm trapping, aye
Bitch, I'm trapping out the mansion
I ain't trapping out no abando
This ain't no Versace, this a Herman's, fifteen hundo, boy
Done that shit like Shawty Lo
And I got my shorties though, and they carry fo'
Shooting at your fucking lobes
Shooting at your bros and your fucking hoes
Damn, I need to buy a Rolls
Instead I bought a X6 M though
That bitch 150 or two hunda
I don't really know, but I said I want one, I got it
Bands all in my pocket
Whatever I want, you know I bought it
I flex on my opponent
You niggas need to wear some garments, aye

[Chorus: Chief Keef]
Trap, trap, trap, trap, trap, trap, trap
Trap, trap, trap, trap, trap, trap, trap
Trap, trap, trap, trap, trap, nigga, trap
You ain't getting no damn money, I suggest yo ass to trap
Trap, trap, trap, trap
Trap
Trap
Nigga, trap, nigga, trap, nigga, aye
I suggest yo ass to trap, nigga
Trap, trap, nigga, trap, nigga, trap, trap, trap, trap, trap

[Verse 2: Shawty Lo]
I made my first mill in the trap
Bankhead born [?]
A lotta y'all talking in your rap
Come and find out y'all don't really know 'bout that
Oooh, it's Shawty
Getting to the money with my youngins
Gas stove, I be burning
Baking soda water, I be drowning
Life's a gamble, we shooting crap
Trap, trap, trap ,talking about in the rap
30 for 'em, they in the wrap
Never sleep, I will nap
Oooh, it's Shawty
Getting to the money with my youngins
Keep it one hunna, three hunnid
30 bricks cost me 300

[Chorus: Chief Keef]
Trap, trap, trap, trap, trap, trap, trap
Trap, trap, trap, trap, trap, trap, trap
Trap, trap, trap, trap, trap, nigga, trap
You ain't getting no damn money, I suggest yo ass to trap
Trap, trap, trap, trap
Trap
Trap
Nigga, trap, nigga, trap, nigga, aye
I suggest yo ass to trap, nigga
Trap, trap, nigga, trap, nigga, trap, trap, trap, trap, trap
