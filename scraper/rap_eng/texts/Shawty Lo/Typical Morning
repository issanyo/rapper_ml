[Hook: Gucci Mane & Shawty Lo]
It was a typical morning
Early in the morning
Way I work my wrist, it's like I'm doing a performance
I'm yawning 'cause I'm horny
I'm doing it 'cause I'm horny
Way I work my, way I work my, way I work my, way I work my
That hoe wants it
Tell me who wants it
Magic City Monday, I got the thunderstorming
We got it storming
You know we got it storming
Gucci, Shawty Lo, and we rolling, rolling, rolling

[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]
It's flaking and it's caking and it's making when I scrape it
I burn it, then I turn it, then I let my junkie taste it
Put a pill in the pot, drop a light blue deuce
Visionary, clear [?] dope, clear coat, too
In the kitchen, water whipping, Gucci, Gucci, what you doing?
Gave her ass $400 just to stop all the confusion
Truck coming in, but I really want to ship
Straight drop dope, hell nah, it ain't no whip
I got grimy niggas' AIM when I put it on the screen
Can't eat, can't sleep, just geek, geek, geeking
Two-thousand pounds coming in this week
My partners call me thrift store 'cause I'm so cheap
Reminds me of a very, very expensive bag of weed
Maybe she can turn me on to some fucking keys
She reminds me of a very, very expensive bag of weed
Maybe she can turn me on to some fucking keys

[Verse 2: Shawty Lo]
I'm a hustler, I'm A-town's finest
Niggas talking fast, but they really behind us
Yeah, they're really vaginas
Pussy! I'm Bankhead's finest
And Bankhead is where you can find us
I'm the real d-boy, you just d-boy rhyming
Yeah, you just d-boy climbing
You ain't never been there, I'm a d-boy Heisman
L-O, L-O, I still be the man in here
And I ain't drop yet, but the streets still demanding him
The streets still believe in him, Shawty Lo believe in him
Say, he did what?
Nah, the streets ain't believing him
