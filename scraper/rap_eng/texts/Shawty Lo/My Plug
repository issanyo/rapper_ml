[Intro: Eldorado Red & Shawty Lo]
My plug, my plug
I love my plug
My plug, my plug
I love my plug
My plug, my plug
My plug, my plug

[Hook (4x): Eldorado Red]
I love my amigo friends, I'm plugged in with ese and them
Last year, I spent a half a mill with my Mexicans

[Verse 1: Eldorado Red]
I love my migo friends, I ain't on no bullshit
Even talked in Spanish 'cause I came and bought so many bricks
Hit a lick? Hell, no, never rob a migo, dog
Migo got my diamonds, I put blue, just like a waterfall
Migo bought me big house, six bedrooms, mane
Word on the street, Rado got them square things
Baby, you can shop with me, dog, just keep with your mouth closed
'Cause my amigo be coming in with kilos
I'm talking truck loads, can you handle that?
Sniffing cakes like my granny flipping flapjacks
A hundred pack gone in thirty minutes
That's a hundred grand worth of popcorn midget
Your connect real? My connect realer
On 20 East with them things in my 18-wheeler

[Hook (4x): Eldorado Red]
I love my amigo friends, I'm plugged in with ese and them
Last year, I spent a half a mill with my Mexicans

[Verse 2: Shawty Lo]
I'm connected to the socket, where your wallet?
Niggas talking 'bout it's a drought, boy, stop it
And you know I keep the white girl
Eighteen-five, but I had to go up in stacks
It'll be two weeks before them things get back
But in the meantime, break them down in packs
Even boys in the hood break them down in sacks
This is real nigga shit if you're trying to get back
Me and Eldorado in a 'rado
Which one, Lo, going for the low-low?
You thought I was a migo, now my name is Dalo
But they ain't getting no money, tell them [?]

[Hook: Eldorado Red & Shawty Lo]
My plug, my plug
I love my plug
My plug, my plug
I love my plug
My plug, my plug
I love my plug
My plug, my plug
I love my plug
I love my amigo friends, I'm plugged in with ese and them
Last year, I spent a half a mill with my Mexicans
I love my amigo friends, I'm plugged in with ese and them
Last year, I spent a half a mill with my Mexicans
I love my amigo friends, I'm plugged in with ese and them
Last year, I spent a half a mill with my Mexicans
I love my amigo friends, I'm plugged in with ese and them
Last year, I spent a half a mill with my Mexicans
