The song wasn't even called "I'm da Man" at, at first, you know what I'm saying?
I used to come to the studio, run through beats and shit, you know what I'm saying?
I had like that beat, and I've been writing a verse, you know what I'm saying?
I had did the first verse, you know what I'm saying?
I was thinking, you know what I'm saying
"Man, what the Hell this hook gon' motherfucking be?"
You know what I'm saying
I couldn't come up with it, you know what I'm saying
So my, me and my President, Born Immac,  you know what I'm saying
We, goddamn, you know, he heard the, uh
Me saying "I'm the man" inside my verse
And he chopped that motherfucker up and put that, like, "I'm the man", you know?
And then, you know what I'm saying, like
Niggas in the street, like, coming up to me like
"Damn, Lo, man. We know you live that shit for real, man
We don't know nothing about home or other niggas, you know what I'm saying?
We don't know nothing about them niggas, man, you know what I'm saying?
We wanna, you know what I'm saying, we wanna hear you"
I said, man, I swear I thought that shit was luck
And next thing you know, I just start vibing
And doing more songs and more songs
And shit, everybody said, "Shit, boy. You the one, Lo
You just don't know it, you're the one"
