[Intro: Shawty Lo]
What's happening?
Ain't telling you niggas 'bout me
You ready?
Oh, okay, I ain't know you was ready

[Verse 1: Shawty Lo]
Ain't telling Yyu niggas 'bout me ('cause they know)
Shawty Lo, I am the street
One hundred, I am a G
Bankhead, who want it with me?
This is not rap, man, this is my life
It was a gamble, but I rolled them dice
Four, tre', five, three, six, eight
Yeah, nigga, now the kid sitting straight
[?]
My mama so proud of me

[Chorus: Shawty Lo, Phace Baity & Both]
Ain't telling you niggas 'bout me
One hundred, I am a G
Bankhead, who want it with me?
Ain't telling you niggas 'bout me
Ain't telling you niggas 'bout me
Ain't telling you niggas 'bout me
One hundred, I am a G
Adamsville, who want it with me?
Ain't telling you niggas 'bout me
Ain't telling you niggas 'bout me

[Verse 2: Phace Baity]
Man, time is a motherfucker and I've been waiting
Shawty Lo got a secret weapon and it's the Phace
Niggas ain't on my level, I'm out of here, gone
But always keep it gutta 'cause ATL's my home
Adamsville's my hood, 3-dub, to be exact
Always keep that 'thrax that take you to Iraq
J gots them packs, my dog back on the scene
Niggas talking 'bout work, selling you niggas dreams
Real dope boys is here to set this shit straight
These fuck niggas is talking like they ran the A
Lo gave them Hell and I had them locked
So which part of the city you niggas talking 'bout?
Steady grinding this here and Valley Hood is back
Slim and Spoon, what's happening? Can't wait till you get back
I told you niggas that these real D-boys is here
Like a group of magicians, making them disappear

[Chorus: Shawty Lo, Phace Baity & Both]
Ain't telling you niggas 'bout me
One hundred, I am a G
Bankhead, who want it with me?
Ain't telling you niggas 'bout me
Ain't telling you niggas 'bout me
Ain't telling you niggas 'bout me
One hundred, I am a G
Adamsville, who want it with me?
Ain't telling you niggas 'bout me
Ain't telling you niggas 'bout me
Ain't telling you niggas 'bout me
One hundred, I am a G
Bankhead, who want it with me?
Ain't telling you niggas 'bout me
Ain't telling you niggas 'bout me
Ain't telling you niggas 'bout me
One hundred, I am a G
Adamsville, who want it with me?
Ain't telling you niggas 'bout me
Ain't telling you niggas 'bout me
