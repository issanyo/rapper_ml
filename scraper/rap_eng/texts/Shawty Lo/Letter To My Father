[Hook]
I really miss you papa
I really miss you papa
I really miss you papa
I really miss you papa
I really miss you papa
I really miss you papa
I really miss you papa

[Verse 1]
Red in my eyes
Tears on my cheek
It’s not a dream
Thought I was sleep, don’t know what to think
My mama was screaming
We came from the beach
My daddy gone
I know he at home, I know he at peace
Now I’m at peace
His spirit is free
Carry the game
You got the key
Heir to the throne
Forever my king
Yeah yeah, yeah yeah, yeah
Yeah yeah, yeah yeah, yeah yeah
I miss you
I miss you

[Hook]
I really miss you papa
I really miss you papa
I really miss you papa
I really miss you papa
I really miss you papa
I really miss you papa
I really miss you papa

[Outro]
Damn
I wish I could’ve told you I loved you ‘fore you left
But you know
We gon’ walk again one day
We Walker boys, right?
I remember I used to catch the bus to the Decatur train station
Catch the 15 bus all the way to the pavilion
Just to be with you on the weekends
I remember you went to the feds
Making trips
Back and forth to Florida
You laid down, you ain’t say nothing
I remember you had to struggle
I told you come on up here, I got you
Live with me
Carl Lee Walker
(I miss you
I’m talking to my daddy)
