[Verse 1: Shawty Lo]
I'm the nigga [?]
Man, I'm home, man, I got a lot of cousins
Hair shop, beauty parlor, who they stussing
These stinking bitches would say they love me
Bitch, I love y'all, too
First night stand, make it do what it do
Know that, know that, go and take the flick
This, this, this definition of rich
A-Town, Bankhead, my street
A real OG's can vouch for me
Skin tight [?]
Even Q-Ball love to scream

[Hook (3x): Shawty Lo]
Dubs, fifties, hundreds, no change
