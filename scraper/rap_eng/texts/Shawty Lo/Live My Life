[Shawty Lo]
I was thrown in the game in '76
By the year '93 i was in the mix
Knee lan key said we had bad ways
Old folks say we gon shaun our days
Slow ya roll Shawty, Pump ya breaks
Life ain't peachy in the Georgia state
U.S.D.A, yeah shes with in
Now im puttin in a laugh with the goverment
Now im bein watched by the goverment
Still bein watched by the goverment
A Town, Westside I represent
And all that hatin is irrelevant
I been gettin my blessings ever since
Ain't sayin im a angel but im heaven sent

God please bless all americans
Please bless all americans

[Chorus]
If i die tomorrow
I could be mad (could be mad)
I dun seen my life (i dun seen my life)
I dun lived my life (lived my life)
If i die tomorrow
I could be mad (could be mad)
I dun seen my life (i dun seen my life)
I dun lived my life (lived my life)

[Shawty Lo]
Theres a war going on in Newaga Streets
Still going on in Shilver street
Why things gotta be the way they be?
I thought Abe Lincoln said we was free
From the things i see, that can not be
In the court room yeah where, roam, we
The laws and the gestures (still thug life)
That why my partners (got all this time)
Cause thats why Brian Nichols lost his mind
We'll never know till the end of time (aye!)
Till the end of time
We'll never know till the end of time (aye!)

[Kool Ace]
Ya'll know we'll never know till the end of time
Ya'll know we'll never know till the end of time
Ya'll know we'll never know till the end of time
Hizadi ha Shawty Lo mann
Shawty wanna be, a big rock star
A lotta thugs goin in the back of the car
They all sang, Oh Yeah! The game goes on
Ya'll sit back and listen to ol' Shawty's rock song
When he say Oh Yeah! And the game goes on
Ya'll sit back and listen to ol' Shawty's rock song
And we gone
