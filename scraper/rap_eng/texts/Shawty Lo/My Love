[Hook: Lyfe Jennings]
My love, long as I’m breathing
You’re what I’m feeling ‘til the end of time
Even when I touch the sky
You’ll be my love, my guardian angel
Just wanna thank you for holding me down
Nobody else was around

[Verse 1: Shawty Lo]
Yeah, shawty got that good love
When I’m up in it, I can tell the way your toes curl
You remind me of my first love
That was then, this is now, this is your world
And when I went to prison
You ain’t have to wait, yeah you made your own decisions
Can’t explain how I’m feeling
Before I had a mil you was one in a million

[Hook: Lyfe Jennings]
My love, long as I’m breathing
You’re what I’m feeling ‘til the end of time
Even when I touch the sky
You’ll be my love, my guardian angel
Just wanna thank you for holding me down
Nobody else was around

[Verse 2: Shawty Lo]
I’m from the hood, shawty from the suburbs
She in my nest getting rest, that’s my love bird
Shawty got that good love
I swear to god she remind me of my first plug
She remind me of that white girl
They make moves, I make movies
It’s only one me, them boys can’t be me
I am L-O, you can be V-E

[Hook: Lyfe Jennings]
My love, long as I’m breathing
You’re what I’m feeling ‘til the end of time
Even when I touch the sky
You’ll be my love, my guardian angel
Just wanna thank you for holding me down
Nobody else was around

[Bridge: Lyfe Jennings]
You’ll be my love
Nobody else was around
You’ll be my love
Nobody else was around
You’ll be my love
Nobody else was around
You’ll be my love
Nobody else was around

[Hook: Lyfe Jennings]
My love, long as I’m breathing
You’re what I’m feeling ‘til the end of time
Even when I touch the sky
You’ll be my love, my guardian angel
Just wanna thank you for holding me down
Nobody else was around
You’ll be my
