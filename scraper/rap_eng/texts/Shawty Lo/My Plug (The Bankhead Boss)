[Verse: Shawty Lo]
I'm connected to the socket, where your wallet?
Niggas talking 'bout it's a drought, boy, stop it
And you know I keep the white girl
Eighteen-five, but I had to go up in stacks
It'll be two weeks before them things get back
But in the meantime, break them down in packs
Even boys in the hood break them down in sacks
This is real nigga shit if you're trying to get back
Me and Eldorado in a 'rado
Which one, Lo, going for the low-low?
You thought I was a migo, now my name is Dalo
But they ain't getting no money, tell them [?]

[Hook: Eldorado Red & Shawty Lo]
My plug, my plug
I love my plug
My plug, my plug
I love my plug
My plug, my plug
I love my plug
My plug, my plug
I love my plug
I love my amigo friends, I'm plugged in with ese and them
Last year, I spent a half a mill with my Mexicans
I love my amigo friends, I'm plugged in with ese and them
Last year, I spent a half a mill with my Mexicans
I love my amigo friends, I'm plugged in with ese and them
Last year, I spent a half a mill with my Mexicans
I love my amigo friends, I'm plugged in with ese and them
Last year, I spent a half a mill with my Mexicans
