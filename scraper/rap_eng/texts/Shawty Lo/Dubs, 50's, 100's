[Intro: Shawty Lo]
Dubs, fifties...
Dubs, fifties, hundreds, no change
Dubs, fifties, hundreds, no change

[Chorus: Shawty Lo]
Dubs, fifties, hundreds, no change
Dubs, fifties, hundreds, no change
Dubs, fifties, hundreds, no change
Dubs, fifties, hundreds, no change

[Verse 1: Shawty Lo]
I'm the nigga [?]
Man, I'm home, man, I got a lot of cousins
Hair shop, beauty parlor, who they stussing
These stinking bitches would say they love me
Bitch, I love y'all, too
First night stand, make it do what it do
Know that, know that, go and take the flick
This, this, this definition of rich
A-Town, Bankhead, my street
A real OG's can vouch for me
Skin tight [?]
Even Q-Ball love to scream

[Chorus: Shawty Lo]
Dubs, fifties, hundreds, no change
Dubs, fifties, hundreds, no change
Dubs, fifties, hundreds, no change
Dubs, fifties, hundreds, no change

[Verse 2: Parlae]
I'm blowing money like the candles on a cake, hoe
'Cause I'm adding Arm and Hammer on my cake, hoe
Aye, I'm getting hundreds and hundreds and hundreds
I'm in the trap screaming, "money, more money, more money"
And I'm the motherfucking hustle man
I hold the pot and work the fork with my other hand
I got the J's at my window like Brother Man
'Cause I hit the pot like I got a couple hands
Aye, I got a rubber band bank, boy
From making plays on them thousand-gram cakes, boy
Dubs, fifties, and hundreds
Got me throwing up money like I'm sick to my stomach

[Chorus: Shawty Lo]
Dubs, fifties, hundreds, no change
Dubs, fifties, hundreds, no change
Dubs, fifties, hundreds, no change
Dubs, fifties, hundreds, no change

[Outro: Shawty Lo]
I ride, I die for that M-O-N-E-Y
West side, east side, M-O-N-E-Y
North side, south side, nigga, M-O-N-E-Y
We ride, we die for that M-O-N-E-Y
