[Hook]
Bricks all white bricks all white bricks
White ten bricks just yellow bricks
Just 50 more bricks
Uh howling like a bitch
With all these bricks
Uh bricks 36 sips
That’s the whole shit
What a bad bitch
Got a whole brick
But it makes this
With those bricks
Well I still take bricks

[Verse 1]
All white bricks all white bricks
Ain’t the days make the J’s so hood which
Like ten bricks so they may sell
To my Carolina boys
Who has made a full kill
Hey rich like sorino
We would work up like Ike and tina
Nigga quiets kill got the things with me
Like mike fills hey and I don’t need no medal
Chain so big it’s the size of your kids
Done done done what did you a man like me
Gucci serving your bread

[Hook]
Bricks all white bricks all white bricks
White ten bricks just yellow bricks
Just 50 more bricks
Uh howling like a bitch
With all these bricks
Uh bricks 36 sips
That’s the whole shit
What a bad bitch
Got a whole brick
But it makes this
With those bricks
Well I still take bricks
