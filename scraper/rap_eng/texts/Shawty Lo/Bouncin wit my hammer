[Intro]

[Hook]
I'm just ballin' in the club
And bouncin' with my hammer
Bouncin' with my hammer, bouncin' boucin' with my hammer
Just ballin' in the club
And bouncin' with my hammer
Bouncin' with my hammer, bouncin' boucin' with my hammer


[Verse 1 : Mike Knox]
I play twenty... cause nigga I'm the shit
Ballin' like Carmelo, every month a different whip
When I step inside the club
All the strippers know what's up
I just start to throw the money
They love to pick it up
Bringing bottle after bottle after bottle after bottle
I'm money-motivated, I know you niggas hate it
I ain't mean a ? you're waiting
Come on baby now shake it
See them diamonds 'round my bracelet
I know you cannot take it
I get it how I get it, spend it how I spend it
Life is good, I live it like I live it
WNBA, I'mma fuck her on the ?
She smelling at a nigga so I know she's really with it (with it)

[Hook]

[Verse 2 : Shawty Lo]
Bounce, bounce with the hammer
Four top fantasty bouncin' with the hammer
My philly hoe sexy like my ?
She like it, I love it
Got damn, motherfuck it
Shawty got the molly and the powder
Y'all broke ass niggas, y'all should've stay home
Autograph-free, Audemars 100 thou'
Lot of bread bitches stay in line to break by
Yeah, and it ain't even been a hour
Drop fourty points on a head like Lebron
Hell yeah I'll pay the Heat nigga you don't wanna gamble
Bankhead shawty belly bouncin' with the hammer

[Hook]
