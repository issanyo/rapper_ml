[Intro 2: DJ Drama]
Hey Dorrough
You know you started something with this "Get Big" shit, right?
Got the whole world on it now huh?
Catch up suckas!

[Verse 1: Dorrough]
Hey, first thing first, I hit the scene solo
I rep the triple D, Dirk Nowitzki Tony Romo
I can’t be touched, oh no, I’m flashy like a photo
My car paint like the AT&T logo
Blue and white paint on a Mazarati fo’ do’
My outerwear is Gucci but my underwear is polo
You say you getting money but you baby mama say
You got a dollar in yo pocket, say my nigga youse a hobo

[Hook: Dorrough]
You ain’t got enough money [x2]
Get big [x4]

[Bridge: Diddy (over Hook)]
This that Dirty Money crew, yeah
Hey yo Dorrough, it’s ya boy Diddy
It’s big nigga talk right here motherfucker
C’mon check this out - go!

[Verse 2: Diddy]
Who the fuck talkin’ money, ha ha ha funny
I got so much money, my money count money
My nickname is Billy, I’m a motherfucking star
My penthouse so high that my address is Mars
Bought an oil rig now my bank counts Arabian
Yacht so big, you coulda sworn I brought the navy in
This is my throne, the top, I’m alone
If you ain’t close to a billion, take yo broke ass home
Motherfucker

[Hook]

[Bridge: Diddy (over Hook)]
Take yo broke ass home man
This is big money talk right here
This is the remix
I see you Dorrough, c’mon
C’mon let’s talk that shit niggas, let’s go

[Verse 3: Yo Gotti]
I spit dope boy knowledge, bird in my pocket
There’s too many hundreds, they can’t fit in the wallet
Rubber band up, all white down
Three hundred twenties for the whole pound
Big block gators, fresh pair of Marcs
599, brand new Ferrari
Remix, yeah nigga get it
Million dollar nigga, money be my best friend
Yo Gotti!

[Verse 4: Bun B]
I got my city on my back, my diamonds on my front
Conjure up in my cup, granddaddy in my blunt
Did it 2000 and whatever, the year is after this is
Cadillac shoes and the jazzy yellow misses
Wanna blow me kisses, right around the zipper
Down and drop it to the flo’ and I ain’t even gotta tip her
R.I.P. to Jack Tripper, two up in the crib
They say they wanna have my babies then they better get a bib
Here they come

[Verse 5: Diamond]
I came in as a rookie with my pockets on fat
Got a million dollar pussy, bitch, my cat got stacks
Uhh, n-n-n-now that a boss bitch move
If you go against the boss but the boss never loses
Got a house on the water so I can feed the gators
Rasberry Porsche, 32 flavors
My bread so swoll, I can’t fit it in my wallet
My pockets on big, Christopher Wallace

[Verse 6: Shawty Lo]
Do it shawty, let me say
Shawty Lo do it B.I.G
I like a lot of hoes and I love the freaks
But if I had to choose - M.O.E
You ain’t got enough paper
Middle finger to a hater
You remember me? Big Uf
Purp in mine, what’s in yo cup?

[Hook]

[Verse 7: Wiz Khalifa]
I post up, time to roll up
Give the hoes what they need, give the people what they want
Uhh, I don’t fuck with no blunts
You know how it go homie, no zig zag, no drig drag
Wizzle man, rollin’ out the big bag
With a bad bitch, light brown skin thick ass
Never slow, I get mine quick fast
Gettin’ money in this bitch ass

[Verse 8: Maino]
Standin’ on the couch in club with a pocket full of c-notes
Niggas can’t tell me I ain’t bigger then Nino
Hop up in the Coupe, give it gas I’m floatin’
Money getting’ big like the arms on Hulk Hogan
Stacks on top of stacks, baby this is IHOP
I be runnin’ down on sacks, auto I shop
Everything is big, big chain keep a big chrome
Big house big truck, big body red bone

[Hook]

[Outro: DJ Drama]
You didn’t know he was gonna bring it that big huh?
Get used to it! Hahahahaha
And like that, we gone!
