[Verse 1]
Everyone I know, they just want something from me
(What they want, Shawty Lo?) I got a pocket full of money
Everybody know I move units through the city
They ink ain't dry and I'm still sitting pretty
Been had fetty since the '94 summer
A decade later and I'm still doing numbers
Young CEO, King Lo is what they call me
I still fuck around, if you want them, then call me
And say, nigga, don't talk reckless on my phone
You know it's bugs and leeches so don't need the dial tone
And nope, nigga, I don't play like that
Seventeen for the things and they don't like that
I'm still on the grind, niggas know it's my time
This the rare wrist game made me ahead of my time
I spin the fork with right, lean the pot with the left
Glass recipe, compliments to the chef
Whoever knew I'd be usually inclined
I do my thing with the rap, but I'm sick with the grind
Forty-five for a nine, get the split for nine
And the prices don't jump, it's like that all the time

[Hook (8x)]
I got a pocket full of money (What they want, Shawty?)

[Verse 2]
What's happening, what's up, what's really going izz-on?
These hoes leaning, and they slizzard off Patrizz-on
Hey, I see tonight is going digital
Nah, I don't smoke, but you know what the Skittle do
I pop, I roll, it's all, I know
It's the summer time, baby and all this ice got me froze
I ain't gotta talk, let my diamonds do the speaking
I like a lot of girls, but I love them Georgia peaches
Latina, Lebanese, Black, White, or Puerto Rican
Money ain't a thing, man, I blow it every weekend
So what goes up, must come down
So when I throw it up, you know it's going dizz-own

[Hook (8x)]
