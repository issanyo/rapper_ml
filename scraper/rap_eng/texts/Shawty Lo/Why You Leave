[Hook]
Why you leave?
You should've just stayed with me
Why you leave?
You should've just stayed with me

[Verse 1: Quando]
It ain't no way in hell I'm saying rest in peace to you
When you was down, I was down, we had to see it through
You took a step, I took a step, 'cause that's just how we move
They sayin' different, I say fuck them, they was never cool
Ain't in the gang firsthand, I never leave the school
This what I'm hearing, I just pray the shit cannot be true
But for my mothers, for my sisters, gotta make it through
Never switch sides on 'em, never turn your back on 'em
These other tuckers tryna square I got your back homie
Grandma miss you dearly, know you're smiling down on me
Never turned your back on me, always held me down homie
Even in the deepest ocean, know that I would drown homie

[Hook]
Why you leave?
You should've just stayed with me
Why you leave?
You should've just stayed with me

[Verse 2: KeKe]
How the fuck should I feel?
I get a call that my dad just went down the hill
How the fuck should I feel?
Man is it real? won't y'all tell me 'bout that
Everybody screaming that they fuck with my dad
When he was here where was everybody at?
Late night kicking it, damn I'ma miss that
I'll never forget who really had my back
Pops taught me the game, he never cut no slack
Wrong or right he always had my back
I know you looking down on me though
And I'ma take that pedestal for my sisters though
Just for you

[Hook]
Why you leave?
You should've just stayed with me
Why you leave?
You should've just stayed with me

[Outro]
With us
We miss you papa
Forever rocky
Shit don't feel right
I miss you man
Just come back
I miss you dad
I know you'll always be here
Looking down on us
I'ma miss you
