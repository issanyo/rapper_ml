[Hook (8x): ATM & Shawty Lo]
I'm getting jiggy (remix)

[Verse: Shawty Lo]
Hold up, hold on, let the man in this bitch
Bankhead in this bitch, Zone 1 to Zone 6
Getting jiggy in this bitch, Shawty Lo in this bitch
And I'm tipsy, I'm leaning, I'm rolling, I'm horny
Gangsta Grillz productions in my ear, man, they blowing it
I'm high as a four-four, looking for that low-low
And she can go with me and get jiggy if she want to
