[Hook: Dorrough]
S.O.L.O., S.O.L.O
She drop it, so low
One deep, so low
S.O.L.O., S.O.L.O
She drop it, so low
One deep, so low

[Verse 1: Waka Flocka Flame]
On the highway, riding with like thirty K
Youngin' dipped down in the back seat plotting with the Russian K
Pulling this car over, like throwing your life away
Catch you with your top down, then you know it's J.F.K
Clay County nigga, I'm like the mayor
Disrespect them bloodhound's they'll motherfucking spray you
Simon Say her, gon' check his mama
Take them bands, we'll get your little brother and your partner
In the club, we the shit
Ask your girl, she sucked my dick
Flexing like a bitch, I don't do no guest list
Damn these molly's got me rolling like a bitch
Turn the lights down, pour me up
Came to the club just to party and turn up
Drank till I throw up, through your fucking hood up
I just wanna see little mama drop it to the floor and shake that ass

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Dorrough]
I'm balling fast pace, like a fast break
Them niggas hating just cause they in last place
Little mama drop it low and make that ass shake
Make a nigga wonder if it's real or if that ass fake
I fin' it up and throw it from the Gucci bag
Ain't scared to throw it up cause I'll recoup it back
Money making zero's, I call it stupid cash
I want a smart girl, that got a stupid ass
I throw my money high, make her get low
I like them skinny girls, but I want a thick ho
She drop it so low, one deep, so low
And hit this pit cause she do it on my dick bro

[Waka Flocka Flame]
Turn the lights down, pour me up
Came to the club just to party and turn up
Drank till I throw up, throw your fucking hood up
I just wanna see little mama drop it to the floor and shake that ass

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Shawty Lo]
411, she say she need my info
But I informed her, I'm looking for a nympho
Get low, L.O., beat her, D-Bo
Uno, dos, quatro, cinco
Yeah, I'm looking for a slight model
Bad bitch with a body like a Coke bottle
Aye, fat ass like Lola, guess a little water, guess a little soda
Turn the lights down, turn me up
I was asleep, they woke me up
But hold up, I do it for the d-boys
Waka, got the party like the white boys

[Waka Flocka Flame]
Turn the lights down, pour me up
Came to the club just to party and turn up
Drank till I throw up, throw your fucking hood up
I just wanna see little mama drop it to the floor and shake that ass
