Yeah hello
Nigga you gonna stand up
Or you going to stand the fuck down
Hood nigga been doin’ my thing
I don’t even know who came
Dope boy I don’t know what to say
Till I fool around the hood
Girl I’m DJ serene now
The whole world screams
Hello they know we know
She knows hey hey hey
The man want to hit round
Whenever I want hey nigga
I’m on these streets hey hey
Who wanted a grenade
