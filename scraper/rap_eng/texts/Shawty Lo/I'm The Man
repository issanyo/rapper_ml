[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
Old money, new work
Lil coke on my gums like my tooth hurt
They from the red clay, I'm from that brown durt
I love my baby mama, and Grandaddy Purp
New shirt, new jeans
New Bent' cost a nigga two Beams
That's two hundred thousand
Nigga you don't know nothin' bout it
Got real niggas ridin', fuck around we bustin' out it
It's Weezy bitch, yeah it's Weezy ho
Ray Charles mama, I don't even see the dough
Show me the money, show me the dough
I'm low, I'm C.E.O
Got stacks on deck, got hard, got wet
A bad bitch with me, I'm hard, she wet
Got raw, got white, got weed, got syrup
Work!

[Hook: Shawty Lo]
Bitch I'm the man, I, I, I'm the man
Got no wife but the white be my girlfriend
Bitch I'm the man, I, I, I'm the man
I, I, I'm the man
I, I, I'm the man
Bitch I'm the man, I, I, I'm the man
Got no wife but the white be my girlfriend
Got no wife but the white be my girlfriend
Got no wife but the white be my girlfriend

[Verse 2: Shawty Lo]
The cars, the hoes, the life I chose
The ice is froze, my flow is cold
I'm hot for sho', you know it's Low
I been getting money way back in '94
The base, my trap, and you know it be on fire
D4L ain't gettin' money? That's a motherfuckin' lie
I already got money, can't you look at me dummy?
I'm laced head to toe, look at the way your ho chosed
Bank roll unfold, I made it rain on them hoes
'04 four-door double-o on them hoes
Bubble kush I blow, leave the smell on your clothes
I'm gettin' money in the hood and they already know
Whoa!
