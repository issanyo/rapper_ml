[Verse: Shawty Lo]
What it is, what it do? I'm Shawty Lo
I'm on the beans, but these hoes want to smoke
Cali bud guaranteed to make me choke
Bought a hundred thousand [?]
Some call me colonel, some CEO
But the world know me as that nigga Shawty Lo
Been getting money, '94 dough
Did it with the work, now I do it with the flow
Dope boy music, real lifestyle
Bitch, "I'm da Man" got these girls going wild
What it is, what it do? I'm Shawty Lo
I'm on the beans, but these hoes want to smoke

[Hook (2x): Redboi]
Break it down, roll it up, put it the air
Break it down, roll it up, put it the air
Break it down, roll it up, put it the air
We get high, we get high, we get high, we get high
