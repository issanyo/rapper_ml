[Chorus: Redboi]
Break it down, roll it up, put it the air
Break it down, roll it up, put it the air
Break it down, roll it up, put it the air
We get high, we get high, we get high, we get high
Break it down, roll it up, put it the air
Break it down, roll it up, put it the air
Break it down, roll it up, put it the air
We get high, we get high, we get high, we get high

[Verse 1: Shawty Lo]
What it is, what it do? I'm Shawty Lo
I'm on the beans, but these hoes want to smoke
Cali bud guaranteed to make me choke
Bought a hundred thousand [?]
Some call me colonel, some CEO
But the world know me as that nigga Shawty Lo
Been getting money, '94 dough
Did it with the work, now I do it with the flow
Dope boy music, real lifestyle
Bitch, "I'm da Man" got these girls going wild
What it is, what it do? I'm Shawty Lo
I'm on the beans, but these hoes want to smoke

[Chorus: Redboi]
Break it down, roll it up, put it the air
Break it down, roll it up, put it the air
Break it down, roll it up, put it the air
We get high, we get high, we get high, we get high
Break it down, roll it up, put it the air
Break it down, roll it up, put it the air
Break it down, roll it up, put it the air
We get high, we get high, we get high, we get high

[Verse 2: Redboi]
Bitch, I stay high, smoking on that dro
She looking at my eyes and they sit real low
Smoking bubble kush-y, sipping on that Goose
I fetch the bankroll, watch the hoes get loose
Seven hundred on the ounce and bitch, I'm smoked out
Let my partner hit the purp [?], he passed out
I be smoking like a fool, I don't know about you
You can catch me rolling, rolling 'cause a nigga popped, too
Smelling like [?] smoking on Now and Laters
I feel like OutKast 'cause I'm high like elevators
Bitch, I'm Redboi, been getting paper
D4L Records, middle fingers to you haters
Yeah

[Chorus: Redboi]
Break it down, roll it up, put it the air
Break it down, roll it up, put it the air
Break it down, roll it up, put it the air
We get high, we get high, we get high, we get high
Break it down, roll it up, put it the air
Break it down, roll it up, put it the air
Break it down, roll it up, put it the air
We get high, we get high, we get high, we get high

[Verse 3: Braski]
Now I'm in the club, popping, blowing on exotic
Niggas smoking mid, homeboy, you need to stop it
It smell like burned carpet, nah, that ain't it
Folks pass around me like he blowing on the shit
They like, 'Where it's at?' I'm like, 'Here it go'
They like, 'I know you got it 'cause you fuck with Shawty Lo'
What you want, a gram? Or what you want, a fifty?
Don't be stingy with that money, spend it with me

[Chorus: Redboi]
Break it down, roll it up, put it the air
Break it down, roll it up, put it the air
Break it down, roll it up, put it the air
We get high, we get high, we get high, we get high
Break it down, roll it up, put it the air
Break it down, roll it up, put it the air
Break it down, roll it up, put it the air
We get high, we get high, we get high, we get high
