[Hook: Yung Ralph]
My trap stay bunking, my trap stay booming
The folks steady watching, but the money still moving
My trap stay bunking, my trap stay booming
The folks steady watching, but the money still moving
What you doing? (Trapping, trapping, trapping)
What we doing? (Trapping, trapping, trapping)
And what they doing? (Nothing, nothing, nothing)
Aye, the folks still watching, but the trap still booming

[Verse 1: Shawty Lo]
[?] like the Carter, come and place your order
Serve fishscale, with a extra tartar
I drop it in the boiler, add a little water
Mix it with the soda, with it, made it harder
The trap's still bunking, the trap is steady moving
The folks still watching, but the money still moving
And nah, I ain't losing my girlfriend Susan
Made a lot of money, fuck all the hoes choosing
Whispered in my ear, "Shawty Lo, let's do it"
Got right to it, I know how to do it
Plus I'm getting money every time I bust a unit
Put it in the trap, watch the J's who would do it

[Hook: Yung Ralph]
My trap stay bunking, my trap stay booming
The folks steady watching, but the money still moving
My trap stay bunking, my trap stay booming
The folks steady watching, but the money still moving
What you doing? (Trapping, trapping, trapping)
What we doing? (Trapping, trapping, trapping)
And what they doing? (Nothing, nothing, nothing)
Aye, the folks still watching, but the trap still booming

[Verse 2: Yung Ralph]
They say I look like money, smell like money
I got that money, man, my trap stay bunking
Shawty Lo called my phone, he said, "Dog, let's get it"
I told him I need ten, give your boy good ticket
My bankroll stupid, blunt full of fruity
Quarter-million worth of jewelry, got them haters looking stupid
I used to walk around, dirty toes, hoes in my boat
Now I lay it back, the brain, let it rain like a [?]
Rap be rapping, rap be trapping
But I ain't gotta touch the work, I can get it clapping
It's too much, I can't hold this money
I've been stacking so long, I got more than money

[Hook: Yung Ralph]
My trap stay bunking, my trap stay booming
The folks steady watching, but the money still moving
My trap stay bunking, my trap stay booming
The folks steady watching, but the money still moving
What you doing? (Trapping, trapping, trapping)
What we doing? (Trapping, trapping, trapping)
And what they doing? (Nothing, nothing, nothing)
Aye, the folks still watching, but the trap still booming

[Verse 3: Parlae]
People talk about the trap, I got a [?] game
'Cause I keep a 8-ball like a pool game
In my corner pocket, I got a hundred grams
In my other pocket, boy, I got a hundred bands
And I can use the digital or the triple beam
My grams still jump like they bouncing on the trampoline
I can stretch it like footy socks
I wax on and wax off when I'm cooking drop
I got 'em for the L-O
You can ask L-O, I still got elbows
I'm still trapping, I stay pictured like a sun, bitch
I'm still brick-wrap ripping like a [?] bitch

[Hook: Yung Ralph]
My trap stay bunking, my trap stay booming
The folks steady watching, but the money still moving
My trap stay bunking, my trap stay booming
The folks steady watching, but the money still moving
What you doing? (Trapping, trapping, trapping)
What we doing? (Trapping, trapping, trapping)
And what they doing? (Nothing, nothing, nothing)
Aye, the folks still watching, but the trap still booming
