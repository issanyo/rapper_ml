[Chorus: Kool Ace]
I keep a fresh pair of Gators on my feet
The hood's been good to me
Through Atlanta [?] from Oxford Street
The hood's been good to me
I don't ride on nothing less than twenty-three's
The hood's been good to me
Yeah, smoking kush adventure every day of the week
The hood's been good, the hood's been good to me

[Verse 1: Kool Ace]
It's the real Mr. O, so fresh, so clean
Used to be part of the crop, but now I'm the cream
Rose up out my garden, but it must've smelled
Neighbors don't speak to me, they think I'm going to jail
Still ride LeBron James, like I can't tell
Still fucking on they ass, like Dave Chappelle
Serve work on the block like gas at Shell
Putting hoes out my crib, man, Heartbreak Hotel
It's the P to the I to the M to P
I was born in the four, raised in the three
You can catch me at Boom booming in the wee of the night
Or you can catch me at Las Vegas, up under the lights
With a fresh pair on

[Chorus: Kool Ace]
I keep a fresh pair of Gators on my feet
The hood's been good to me
Through Atlanta [?] from Oxford Street
The hood's been good to me
I don't ride on nothing less than twenty-three's
The hood's been good to me
Yeah, smoking kush adventure every day of the week
The hood's been good, the hood's been good to me

[Verse 2: Shawty Lo]
Do it, do it, get it, get it
If you want, then you bitches coming with me
In the pot, coming back like a biscuit
I got 'em whole, all you got to do is hit that
And yeah, I'm the man in my city
Just ask about me, I got units in the city
Mirror mirror on the wall
Who's the freshest of them all?
You know the place where the d-boys be
Holler at Mr. Joe at Oxford Street
Alligator shirt, alligator shoes
Two time in front, alligator one, too

[Chorus: Kool Ace]
I keep a fresh pair of Gators on my feet
The hood's been good to me
Through Atlanta [?] from Oxford Street
The hood's been good to me
I don't ride on nothing less than twenty-three's
The hood's been good to me
Yeah, smoking kush adventure every day of the week
The hood's been good, the hood's been good to me
