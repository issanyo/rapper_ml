[Intro: Miss T]
Shorty you can call on me
Satisfaction guaranteed
Cause I can make it rain on you
And I ain't gotta throw a damn thang

[Shawty Lo]
I'm sittin here lookin out the window (out the window)
Yeah, I'm lookin at the wind blow
Shawty L-O, I'm head of the team
D4L, man I'm livin my dream
Bankhead man I came from that, and
Hehehe, and I ain't ask for nothin
Slow flow man that's what's happenin
Found my swag, now they swear to jack it
Match wear free nigga let me be
Say homeboy, please spare me
Come one hundred I am a G
Baby girl, you can call on me

[Chorus: Miss T]
Shorty you can call on me
Satisfaction guaranteed
Cause I can make it rain on you
And I ain't gotta throw a damn thang
Cause I can make it rain on you
And I ain't gotta throw a damn thang
Shorty you can call on me
Satisfaction guaranteed
Cause I can make it rain on you
And I ain't gotta throw a damn thang

[Shawty Lo]
I'm on my way to the top, is you comin?
Shawty what you doin? I ain't doin nuttin
A hundred G shoppin spree it ain't nuttin
Baby girl I do it big for real
I can make it rain - and I ain't gotta throw it
No ID, black card just show it

And you can call on me, if you need to
Whatever your needs be, I'm a see to
I'm a G boo, you can see too
Satisfaction all night at the one-two

[Chorus]

[Miss T]
And I ain't gotta throw a damn thang...
Baby it's the best, you can call on me
Cause, if you ever feel lonely
I won't hesitate to give you what you need
And just say the word, it's official
I ain't goin nowhere
I'ma be your friend, through the thick and thin
Let 'em stare while we blowin smoke in the air
AYYY~! And I ain't gotta throw a damn thang

[Outro: Miss T - as music fades]
Shorty you can call on me
Satisfaction guaranteed
Cause I can make it rain on you
And I ain't gotta throw a damn thang
