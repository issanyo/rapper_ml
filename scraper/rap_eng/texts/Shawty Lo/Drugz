[Intro: Shawty Lo]
I don’t give a damn about this shit man
I got to mind this motherfuckin’ tree
Bitch go pick it yourself ho
L-O, real bankhead

[Hook: Shawty Lo]
Made a few mils in the trap
I got the strap in my lap
I made some helluva caps
I put my hood on the map
I got whatever in food
Niggas ain’t fucking with us
Even got snow on the bluff
I put your ho in the dust
I got drugs
I got drugs

[Verse 1: Shawty Lo]
I pray to god for my enemies
I don’t know if god into me
Y’all niggas ain’t no kin to me
I hate to sin but it’s you or me
Paper towels at church
Ten percent not thots
Y’all niggas ain’t hungry
Y’all hoes just thirsty
Spend a bag on y’all hoes
Made it back at the bando
Charge up like Toronto
Shake the ho like a red nose
Niggas can’t go how I go
True N-A forever
Thirty wop for a kilo
He high, I’m L-O
Shawty crunch them numbers
Play with snow in the summer
YSL cost a bundle
We did kill ‘em this summer
And I don’t believe in karma
I believe in commas
Big dog like roof
West side of the jungle

[Hook: Shawty Lo]
Made a few mils in the trap
I got the strap in my lap
I made some helluva caps
I put my hood on the map
I got whatever in food
Niggas ain’t fucking with us
Even got snow on the bluff
I put your ho in the dust
I got drugs
I got drugs

[Verse 2: Ralo]
I put my hood on the map
We finna fuck up the globe
I got to stick to the code
The rest of these nigga gon’ fold
You know that shit gon’ get back to me
They want it real, so they gonna ask for me
When I went broke, they turned their back on me
How you my folks and you used to laugh at me?
I used to look up to them, remember?
Now I got more money than them niggas
My kitchen filled with pots and blenders
The rest of these niggas is still pretenders
None of these rappers done go to your funeral
I think they forgot what you used to do for them
Remember them shots, we used to shoot for them
You popped a lot, but you used to root for them
You had them shaking that laffy taffy
You used to make all them niggas happy
You was the man before you started rapping
You made all of your kids proud of their daddy
We done it all and made us a don
We the ones didn’t forget where we from
Ocean Drive, you know it’s still alive
Long live forever, don’t ever die

[Hook: Shawty Lo]
Made a few mils in the trap

Even got snow on the bluff

I got drugs
I got drugs
