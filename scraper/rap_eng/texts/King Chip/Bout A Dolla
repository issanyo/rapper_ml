[Hook: The O'My's]
Living the dream ain't all it seems
Some turn fiends for the paperback greens
Truth be told, it's all I know
I'd rather go blind than lose my soul
Rather not eat if it means I can't speak
I don't lose sleep over niggas who's sweet
See this whole dream was built on cream
If it ain't about a dollar why you talking to me?

[Verse One: Chuck Inglish]
See oil's still spillin', niggas still chillin' tho
We in your house like the rock through the window
Yeah ho, and it's like that for you
And you thought that I wasn't going to mention this at all
It's about to blow and everybody's on dope
Like who hasn't died from a fuckin' overdose
Well here's a song, get on, methadone
Take the edge off, slid off, how you love that
This is how we do it, we writin' them real raps
I ain't got to worry about gettin' my chain back
Cuz niggas know I don't need to get mine snatched
And I hope when they hear this they can feel where I'm at
Like back in the day buying tapes before sacks
Macks catch a case in the face, Max pen
And it happened to some friends
They intentions were waybetter than their decisions
I'm not finished
Call every number on my phone like 'you heard that new song, that came on
It was wild, that nigga Chuck lost his mind on that line'
And it rhymed like...

[Hook: The O'My's]

[Verse Two: Chip Tha Ripper]
Twenty-Twelve is here, we all is avatars
We all be livin' large, we all got pretty broads
The whole globe is ours, we taking over the earth
You thought it was bad now, this shit is going to get worse
Cuz niggas with money too flashy, unruly
Brain washed by this life, it's like a movie
Stay the realist to the end, call me young Abbie Hoffman
Hear about em all the time, we don't see em often
And he don't fit in with all them cornballs
It's going down to late to warn ya'll
This is how real niggas get down, too laid back
Cause attention is for girls, that's why she's wearing that

[Hook: The O'My's]

[Verse Three: Chance The Rapper]
Little rapper, wrap up all that trap rap bullshit
You can dancer, back up (IGH)
Damn dear prancers, don't dash for dames
Don't dip for chips, don't give up your chain
Let me flash the bang, wait and see if they buck
Let me see if they miss, if they hit me it's luck
If they touch me I quit, I'm a rapper's delight
I'm the rapper to like, a comma after the the
Got a bad appetite (IGH)
Fake food that's that shit I dislike (IGH)
Fake boobs that's that shit I did like (IGH)
She likes the mixed drinks
I like the mixed type
She got an accent
She loved the mixtape
Oh you're english?
You heard of Chuck The Rapper?
You heard of Chance The Ripper?
You wanna fuck a rapper?
Life's funny like that, like that
Make it then you bring it right back, right back

[Verse Four: Twista]
The things that people are willing to do when they want to go straight to the top
Integrity's always important regardless if you ever make it or not
I seen enough of the suffering, what will we do and amounting to nothing and
No method for kissing and hugging the babies, they hatin' instead of lovin' them
And what's up with the government, it never get better
We forever fight over cheddar, so what does it matter who running it - democrat or republican
Stay on top of your business, let nobody stop you from living the dream
Try to be careful about what you do because nothing is as good as it seems
Out of the dark, steppin up hard into the light
Whatever's wrong you can do right, Going against everybody in spite
Lovin' the thoughts they might be having about you not bein' able to come with it on em
...until you shitted on em
Enemies finna face defeat, so they finna hate me
Came through in the place to be in a Benz, Mercedes
They way I spit I'm laced with heat so they imitate me
