Givin girls rides to the crib not a rat trap
Cheese, peanut butter freeze raps
I want all these snapped in his back in the day
Like a tall tee tag

What's the weather gon be?
Drop top, no drips on this (supoustry  ?)
Supposed to be headed downtown
Carwash like (blal  ?)
And my girl drive the chevy while I break this tree down
Roll the window back up
Good, turn it back up
Ugh, UGK
Diamonds & Wood
Hold up, yea roll up

You do this right, you might have the time of ya life

Asher Roth:
I be frustrated with the way that shit's been agin
And Im about to take a break and get away on a vacation
Like, maybe Malaysia to escape the meditation
I'll just eat, pray and wait for my day of revelation or I'll
Take peyote, roam the rivers of Nairobi
Change my name to Navajo and live alone and only grow weed
Cuz this Naomi flowin show gets pretty lonely
Dont nobody ever know you
Everybody call you homie
Moany Moany they'll be sure to treat you phony
As soon as you hit your low they won't be pickin up the phone
See, Im moved to (Comie  ?) show these fools that I am home
And when Im on the microphone all you wanna-be's can blow me
So, take this boner to the dome you little bo-peeps
That may be inapropy but Im certainly no sheep
See, I only lead in this game of entertainment
