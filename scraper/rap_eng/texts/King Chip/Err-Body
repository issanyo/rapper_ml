[Verse 1]

[T.I.]
Only signed that nigga cause he had that song
Thought he was that nigga but I had that wrong
Had I known what I know, I'd a left that alone

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
[Trae Tha Truth]

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Chip]
I use to throw my coins away, bought pennies made pounds
Pennies for my force, and pussy every penny counts
And everywhere we go, these people wanna know
They wrecking, they turning up, carry on till your speaker blows
Cause time's money, money's time nigga
It's g.d.o.d, I'm still alive nigga
I rep my city, yea I put on for my cut
All I do is murder verse, now who wants to die first
It's hustle gang my nigga, I'm putting on for my team
Spazzing on that trigger, but I'm shooting after my dream
Been a problem since I stepped in,****it I'm fresher than a freshmen
Step in the booth and I'll burn the mic, like check one, two, testing

[Hook]

[Verse 4: B.o.B]
Hustle gang over everybody in here
If I'm in building alone then it's a hundred million in here
From another planet motherfucker I been sent here
My dick so long I'll go back time and****yo bitch for ten years
I'm this real, I'm this real, I'm colder than windshield
I walk through the front door like what's up the pimp's here
Life in the fast lane, I wake up in sixth gear
I wake up in vegas like bitch why you still here
That's just how I go about it, B.o.B best know about it
Nigga I be everywhere, if I'm on a plane I know the pilot
All them haters talking shit, nowadays they show is quiet
Tell me why you front row, with your main bitch she so excited, so excited

[Hook]

[Verse 5: Shad da God]
We ain't got no conscious, we don't show no pity
Turn up in yo town, put this up in yo city
Dirty ass bank roll, no this ain't no diddy
Posted in the trap, pull up get a 50
Shitting on these niggas, safe to say A.P. shitty
Ain't nothing lil bitty, Big ass in my glass drop
And this****on 50, Careful what you ask for
Grind for every thing, so we ain't never had to beg for
Bad red bitch, you know I fucks until her legs sore
When I'm in her spot, you know that 45 on the dresser
Whole click sold blumma, don't get in****you can't handle
Straight pulling up in them toys, but we don't play around Southside Atlanta
Hustle Gang over everybody

[Hook]
