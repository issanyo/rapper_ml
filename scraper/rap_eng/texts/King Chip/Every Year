[Verse 1: Chip]
I woke up, yes, I woke up
Thank god I woke up
I didn't have to woke up
I woke up your bitch and told her roll up coffee
And hopped up in the shower, washed yesterday off me
Then hopped out the bathroom, threw on the polo
Few sticks of diesel got my morning in slo-mo
But that's how I like it, taking it easy
Really ain't no need for all the energy, you can save it
Matter fact, you can replace it
This shit is great, nah this shit amazing
We on the freeway, smokin' and leanin'
We ridin' dirty so no need for speedin'
On the turnpike to whichever city we pull up
Don't be surprised if I'm in your hood like "what up?"
I'll be in chicago like what
(?) full of sluts, south side with ya chutch
With GL in the CL, bendin' through the community
Gun shots, ciroc, same shit I usually see
Hell yeah, real niggas every year
Niggas hustle where I live, swish rips every year

[Hook]
Yeah
Niggas gettin' money 'round here
Niggas hustle where I live
Swish rips every year
Yeah
Niggas gettin' money 'round here
Niggas hustle where I live
Swish rips every year

[Verse 2]
Now listen up, no need to act stiff
Too fresh, under arrest
I plead the sax fifth
Let them packs flip
Fuck them other niggas get dumb rich
Grip the grain til the polish fade off that son'bitch
Cash rules, I know some seven deadly sinners
Who be shining every summer cause they grinding every winter
Get paid, my nigga, they don't like when I stunt
Fuck a soundcheck bro, just come and mic the fuck up
Put your hands up high if you a stand up guy
And is there any bad bitches in the spot tonight?
I'm pretty high, liquor party with my nigga Cudi
I'm just looking for a bad chick with a little money
And he just wanna high class chick who ain't slutty
I'll be ducked off them hoes be looking for me
Incognegro, sipping on mojito, money go every where we go
We ain't poor!

[Hook]
Yeah
Niggas gettin' money 'round here
Niggas hustle where I live
Swish rips every year
Yeah
Niggas gettin' money 'round here
Niggas hustle where I live
Swish rips every year
Yeah
Niggas gettin' money 'round here
Niggas hustle where I live
Swish rips every year
Yeah
Niggas gettin' money 'round here
Niggas hustle where I live
Swish rips every year
