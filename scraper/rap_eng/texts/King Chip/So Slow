[Chorus: Anderson .Paak]
My old Chevy movin' so slow
But my mind still spinnin' off of coco
Don't let a nigga get his money right
Don't leave no hair up on my sport's coat
Young nigga with a old soul
But my mind still spinnin' off of coco
Don't let a nigga get his money right
Bitch - don't leave no hair up on my sport's coat

[Verse 1: King Chip]
I told a mama make these niggas pay the fair
Have some money leftover when ya done paying me
I'm Pimp Chip something like a Pimp C
I'm out here grippin' and whippin' on wood
And ain't no way I couldn't be, bitch
I'm cold up, pulled up to the Chevron in my Chevy [?]
Tell a bitch to hop out, pump the gas, she was ready
My other stallion hopped out, they hit the store
I rolled the window down, said "Grab some backwood", she said "I know, oh"
Stupid ass nigga, I'm out here, brought the fucking doll
I pull up in the [?] and take your bitch, don't care what the fuck you ball
Stupid ass nigga, I'm out here, brought the fucking doll
My 72 Impala, got some hallow, what you're hallowin' 'bout?

[Chorus: Anderson .Paak]
My old Chevy movin' so slow
But my mind still spinnin' off of coco
Don't let a nigga get his money right
Don't leave no hair up on my sport's coat
Young nigga with a old soul
But my mind still spinnin' off of coco
Don't let a nigga get his money right
Bitch - don't leave no hair up on my sport's coat

[Verse 2: Anderson .Paak]
Young nigga, fresh into some bitch
My white hoe, got a nose in the fun dip
Talk slick, something that she never get to hear
She talk shit, it's only with that other nigga
Ride around - speed slow, these bitches stand hard, [?]
Said, "P do you ever love em?", (Hell no!)
Nowadays can't trust, these hoes, (No!)
Ol' stupid ass nigga I'm out here what the fuck you think these hoes be poppin' that 'P' like it's the cure for pancreas disease (woah!)
Ol' stupid ass nigga, I'm out here what the fuck you think
I'll turn a basic bitch into a motherfucking MVP

[Chorus: Anderson .Paak]
My old Chevy movin' so slow
But my mind still spinnin' off of coco
Don't let a nigga get his money right
Don't leave no hair up on my sport's coat
Young nigga with a old soul
But my mind still spinnin' off of coco
Don't let a nigga get his money right
Bitch - don't leave no hair up on my sport's coat
