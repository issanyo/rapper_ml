(Intro)
Now this some real shit...
Uh...
Drift off...
To a place you wanna be

(Verse)
I-, I-, I wanna go back to my mansion
Not the one in Cleveland, the one in the Hamptons
You can take the Lambo, We takin' the Phantom
My girl got some friends, she said she want me to grab em
Yeah, I keep that new Porsche prancin'
Where the hoes at, and why they not dancin'?
I had an asthma attack in that trailer
Down south where I was at and I had to wake up gaspin'
Matter of fact, I ain't wake up for a few days
IV's, had them mothafuckas in two veins
And momma ain't know what to do
Middle of the night
Baby boy laid out on the couch not breathin'
Momma start screamin'
Ran for the phone
But when she dialed Nine-Eleven
She just heard the tone
Cause' we was in a small town called (Idea?)
Where people had to call on god for the heal
Meanwhile, here I am, half dead on the couch
Momma ran out, bangin' on everybody's house
But less than a minute later, momma was back
With T, he had a truck, tossed me off in the back
But if momma ain't wake up
Then I wouldn't have woke up
And Cleveland wouldn't have had a reason to have its hope up
Slip in the coma right back to my fantasy
Back to all the beautiful bitches attacking me
Back to sippin' them dacharies, couple of hoes fannin' me
And two bitches just laid up butt naked up on the canopy
Back to them Lamborghinis and the Bugattis
And enough of that Benihana's bet I can do karate
And, back to my mansion like you promised me
I'mma see my grandma, and she proud me
Im on the streets of gold, you can't stop me
Please doctor, don't shock me
I dont wanna...
