La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, yeah
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
Hey, howdy, I am super duper good
You can find me drowning in some mini mixed with groupie love
All of the above like Im Maino or Im
When its no more room, its to Cleveland if I needed you
Whip more, fucking niggas stomach up Im throwing them
Hot sauce, really used to be killing when Im drinking though
Used to ride my bike all day, too single jungle though
Dont stop, grind hard, watch cops, give them the smile
Not doing wrong, just chilling oh yeah
We gotta find our ways
If I focus on my dizzle, not these popped out hoes
Trying to find me a Hale Berry up in bed
For somebody I can desperately housewife
But really, fuck you nigga, I ain't trying to play housewife
Independent that give us a good
Understand what other and other records
But women Im amazing, but I know its crazy
See see, now you dont have to like me
Please respect the fucking glory of the mighty
We the all, all, all, all mighty, glory, glory, glory, all mighty
Glory, glory, glory, all mighty, glory, glory, glory, all mighty
Glory, glory, glorious
You want something call me Chip I just be chilling though
Through these crazy hoods and bumpy roads
Memories are living conditions worst than you ever seen
Now its total opposite, Im self made, fresh and clean
Straight up menace, we some rebels bad it did it right
Most advice I get, I just can't use it, they dont live this life
Hope for the best but its probably bad as it seems
I brainstorm coming up yeah I had a few dreams
Used to stand outside at getting tips to help with bags
9 years old running shopping carts to get that quarter back
Shooting my bang bang, dont drive too fast, around my hood
Wish that I could change they perspective and tell them whats really good
Blow about 4 hundred a day on that purple Callie
Cause life is over maintain the financial sanity
Say whats on my mental when disregard the emotional
Try to stay on track and keep it to where Im supposed to go
Before my grandma passed, she told me I will lead the people
Im all that is man fearless, have yet to meet my equal
Im call, ladies and gentlemen, hood niggas and bitches
You all about to witness, how nobody fucking with us
We the all, all, all, all mighty, glory, glory, glory, all mighty
Glory, glory, glory, all mighty, glory, glory, glory, all mighty
Glory, glory, glorious
