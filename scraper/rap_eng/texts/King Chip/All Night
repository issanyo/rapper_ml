[Intro: Domo]
(Na na na nanana)
Nana nana
Ya
Ya

[Hook: Domo]
If you don’t like this song, then go and turn my lights off
I count all my blessings cause I know that karma won’t bite soft
It ain’t too wrong and its timing now, and I know enough to do right, y’all
I hope I shine a new light, y’all, ain't felt this strong in my life, y’all
I sleep and dream about it all night, all night, all night (all night)
I sleep and dream about it all night, all night, all night (all night)

[Verse 1: Domo]
Tell me what it takes, I ain’t waiting around look into a certain face
And uh, they give me space, never get a replace
They gave haste till I paved the way, you can’t relate to this
Surviving on my grounds is dangerous, and despite all the doubt I still take the risk
Why most young niggas thinking that it can’t exist? I just feel it it's my time I can’t shake the shit
Young running up roach clips with thug niggas, pop's in jail should’ve turned into a drug dealer
Late nineties I was still learning what it was nigga, used to be alone until I learned to be in love with it
Still, I was never lead astray, I know I’ll see a better day
And every night I lay, I still had the same dream as the other day
Lord, listen to my Mother pray, goddamn

[Hook]
If you don’t like this song, then go and turn my lights off (my lights off)
I count all my blessings cause I know that karma won’t bite soft (know that karma won’t bite soft)
It ain’t too wrong, and its timing now, and I know enough to do right y’all (do right y’all)
I hope I shine a new light, y’all, ain’t felt this strong in my life, y’all (all night)
I sleep and dream about it all night, (all night), all night, (all night), all night, all night, (all night)
(all night), I sleep and dream about it all night, all night, all night, (all night), (all night), (all night)

[Verse 2: Domo]
Shit, I don’t complain about nothing, dog, I just take my pain and write mad shit
My plan is to come up from nothing and just act like I never had shit
I’m looking in the mirror right now, looking just like my dad did
But I promise y’all if I do one thing, I won't miss the steps my dad did
I’m still screaming “fuck them all”, I’ve become the man that I wanted to
They pray to god that I won’t evolve, but I transform right in front of you
If I die today, just judge me by all my statements, y’all, tell them that I was never afraid at all
I’ve seen the greatest falls, but still I stayed involved, sitting up late getting faded on

[Outro: King Chip]
On and on
I dream about that shit all night, my nigga (all night)
I dream about that shit all night (all night)
I dream about that shit all night, my nigga (all night)
I dream about that shit all night (all night)
I dream about that shit all night, my nigga (all night)
I dream about that shit all night (all night)
I dream about that shit all night, my nigga (all night)
I dream about that shit all night
(I’m really about that shit, I’m really about that shit, I’m really bout that shit, oh)
(I’m really about that shit, I’m really about that shit, I’m really bout that shit, oh)
