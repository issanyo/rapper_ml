[Intro]

[Verse 1: Chip Tha Ripper]
Yeah
Niggas dont know shit about me
First house on Woodworth and EC
One-Nine-Eight-Six the year it be
My middle name is Swahili
Cause daddy was on that Black Panther shit
Leather, medallion, African
Momma taught school and dad did too
Lived in the hood where the kids bad news
So momma used my auntie's address
So they would never have me possessed
What ever she did to relieve her stress
Hid it from me pretty good I guess
First rap I heard ever six years old
Will Smith Fresh Prince that shit was so cold
Hypnotized by them rhymes
Pretty smart kid understands those lines
Front porch on Thornhill cooking up raps
All my niggas now been my niggas way back
Ten years old blowing niggas wigs back
Like "damn little man who taught you that?"
Yeah I was baby man
Rode my back on any land
Then my little sister came
And mom and pop split up again
For the umpteenth shits gonna be fine
Momma said headphones on bumping them rhymes
I'm eleven years old with the mind of a G
Ain't no e'rybody who think like me
Willow Arms, building E
Miss my nigga Mondo rest in peace
Moved down south fifth grade
Macon County really made me a man
On my own small little town big shit went on
Shot my first gun in the woods
Ninth grade moved right back to the hood
On Saint Claire
Thought I was going to be a superstar athlete
Then asthma attacked me
Put that shit on that backseat
And got back on that rhymin
Bought that studio time
With them ends I saved up cutting grass and just a little grindin'
And ain't nobody know about
Daddy taught me patience
Keep that money in the bank
He said when I got cake from Atlantic Records I was eighteen
No lawyer on the scene when I signed that wet dream
Got some paper though racks, commas, dollars
I thought I was set for life cause I ain't had no knowledge 'bout life
Niggas ain't cuttin' no slack when it come to them ends niggas losin' their lives
I learned to stay off of the scene cause ain't nothing but bullets and trouble at night
And my nigga Hawk can no longer walk on the world got 'em I take his advice
If you get a chance to do something real do it right cause you cannot do it twice
I set myself on a mission to get 'em
To switch it a little bit different and tell 'em there's more ways to make a living my nigga
Stace was nineteen when they gave 'em thirty eight years in that prison
I sent him some pics so he see how we livin'
And these were the cards I was given - the bio
