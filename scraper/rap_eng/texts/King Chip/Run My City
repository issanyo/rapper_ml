[Hook:]
Ain't no--ain't nobody fuckin' with me
I run my city baby
I'm the man where I live
Tell them what my name is
Chip tha Rip, Chip--Chip tha Ripper
Chip tha Rip, Chip--Chip tha Ripper

[Verse 1]
I'm a wreckin' cappin' money stackin'
Pistol packin' son of a bitch
I'm throwed-(yeah)-I'm so throwed in the club
And I got my gun in this bitch
Niggas be hatin', talkin' shit
I don't get mad or throw no fits
I'mma let my gun to like the tip of my dick
Everytime I'm with your bitch
Blastoff, Cock-Boom!
Barbeque sauce all over the street
Pieces of you everywhere
You almost as famous as me
Yeah I know you like my whip
But leave it at cause I ain't no punk
Got a diamond in the back and a sunroof top
Every time I cock my Glock I dunk
Roll forty-five in the shotgun pump
Blow out your god damn socks, nigga
I don't give a fuck you ain't heard about me
I'm a motherfuckin' ox, nigga
Flyer than a motherfucker hoes come and get me
I stepped out in my gator boots
And Crocodile Dundee tried to trip me
I don't play with these haters
I let them off until they empty
I bring Kibbles N Bits to the hood
So tell them big boys come and sick me
All it takes is one pound to the crown
And you lost
No matter what game you playin'
You can't beat the boss

[Hook]
Ain't no--ain't nobody fuckin' with me
I run my city baby
I'm the man where I live
Tell them what my name is
Chip tha Rip, Chip--Chip tha Ripper
Chip tha Rip, Chip--Chip tha Ripper

Ain't no--ain't nobody fuckin' with me
I run my city baby
I'm the man where I live
Tell them what my name is
Chip tha Rip, Chip--Chip tha Ripper
Chip tha Rip, Chip--Chip tha Ripper

[Verse 2]

I'mma get my dough
I'mma get my bread
Hundred dollars bills are worth
A lot more than your head
What you wanna do?
I got money in the bank
Try to play battleship with Chip tha Rip
Your ship will sank
I sip purple drank
I roll purple dank
Twenty-eights on the hummer truck can make it look like army tank
Hold up--hold up stop--hold up stop my mind is blank
That hydro got my mind blown I can't think
Now are them twenty-eights on that little Chevrolet
Or am I trippin'?
My car sits up too high
How the hell are we gonna get in?
If it wasn't twenty-fours and up
Then it wasn't Chip then
Doors go out or up up up in the air
I lift them
The wood in the middle of the Christmas Tree
Is what--is what I'm grippin'
Clear finger nail polish
Is what my car got dipped in
Nuts colored golden brown
So I'm sittin in chicken
The outside of my whip is the color of tea
So I'm sittin' in Lipton

[Hook]
Ain't no--ain't nobody fuckin' with me
I run my city baby
I'm the man where I live
Tell them what my name is
Chip tha Rip, Chip--Chip tha Ripper
Chip tha Rip, Chip--Chip tha Ripper

Ain't no--ain't nobody fuckin' with me
I run my city baby
I'm the man where I live
Tell them what my name is
Chip tha Rip, Chip--Chip tha Ripper
Chip tha Rip, Chip--Chip tha Ripper
