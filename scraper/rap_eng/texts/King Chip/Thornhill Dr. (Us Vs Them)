Thornhill Drive

Flying down Thornhill Drive
Police flying down Thornhill
Bitch I'm from for Thornhill, nigga

Lo and behold, runnin' parallel to Eddy Road
When niggas around my hood can't take it no more, they taking your soul
Niggas be ready for war, they ready to go, they out of control
Chopping them down, damn, the ammo is low, we gotta get more
Thousand niggas outside, it's too many yappers, can't nobody stop us
Trained gorillas we busting them coppers, busting their helicopter
Up in the field, niggas is all in the parking lot
Holding the street, my nigga, we deep, hold this piss cause I got them hipped to all the deceit
The lies, drag the God stones, they wanna us all dead, they wanna start over
No, not in my zone, we SK, then AK'd up, my nigga not giving no fuck
Thank God we unified, thank God we fucking them up
Cleveland niggas arriving, they train ahead, the ammo and blunts
How ironic that we using them all on the people they came from
Every member of your SWAT team is dead
Christopher Dorner, he was an animal, you get some monster, that's to your head, what!

It's a war going on outside
Shit is going down on Thornhill Drive
It's a war going on outside
Shit is going down on Thornhill, nigga
It's a war going on outside
Shit is going down on Thornhill Drive
It's a war going on outside
It's a war going on outside, nigga
Thornhill Drive

(Us vs. Them)

Yeah
Me and my niggas is up in this thang
Best believe these nuts gon' hang
Lookn to the left see the [?] young thang
With the ass too fat and the [?] ring
Ho-pin that she know what to do
Gotta choose me cause uh nigga won't choose
Ever seen a nigga hard then you know I won't choose
Now we up in the mall, "Do you like those shoes"
What about the loot, "Do you like that too?"
What about your friends, invite them through
We can do everything that you might wanna do
Everything that you probably wanna do
Now we up in the crib with the lean and the weed
Everybody DTF indeed, gotta be the fliest nigga that you ever seen. Promise I can give you everything that you need, but I won't give you everything that you want. Bitch give me head while I'm blazin the blunt, Bitch let me hit it any way that you want. We up in the Lex, with the bang in the trunk. if a nigga run up on us we blazing him up. Riding through the ghetto lazy as fuck
