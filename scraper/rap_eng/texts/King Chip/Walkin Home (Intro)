[Verse 1: King Chip]
Nigga walkin home from the bus
Never scared to let it bust
Broke niggas make a lot of fuss
Niggas always lookin suss
In the Springfield 40 I trust
Hop the fence on Eddy Road
You already know nigga, this where anything go
Nigga just trynna get home, make it to the front door, these niggas want anything though
Even 35 dollars will get them through the next couple days then they right back huntin (damn)
"What's his name" just died, got shot up in his ride cause they heard he was stunting (damn)
Please god let a nigga make it home these niggas trynna take my book bag
Almost had to uppipe on a nigga with his looking ass
Damn bitch nigga - what you looking at?
Gotta walk past 10 niggas on the porch, all looking scantless
I ain't scared, I'm a product of the lord and I got a fully auto - I can handle this
Nigga let's go, I ain't never been a ho
Bitch I hit you with the, hit you with the
Car with the lights off, creeping up slow
Ahh man let's go, here we go nigga

[Outro: King Chip]
Walking home at night, might not be alright
Walking home at night, nigga might not be alright
