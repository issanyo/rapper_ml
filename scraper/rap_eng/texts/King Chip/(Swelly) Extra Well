We off in this bitch, we doin' extra extra well
And yes oh yes I'm fresh as hell
We off in this bitch, we doin' extra extra well
Oh yes oh yes I'm fresh as hell

[Verse 1 - Chiddy]
We up in this bitch we doin' extra extra well
And my phone blowin' up, I need an extra extra cell
On my outfit, ain't that shit extra extra swell?
It's recess bitch we came here to ring bells
Lookin' to the skies like, could we ever be stars?
I said bitch my flow raw like G-Star
And there's no point in getting bread and coppin' three cars
They lightweight, I'mma throw them off the seesaw
Grindin' this daily, pray in time it don't fail me
And I'm still on my shit hope the weather will sail me
We on it, so fuck your opponent, we dilated and we just
Live in the moment high, fuck it I'm zonin', uh
Young Chiddy turn a verse into a masterpiece
Nigga focused on the pie, I can let you have a piece
Everything you can't be, Fendis in the pantry
Haters marvel at it like Stan Lee, damn me

[Hook]

[Verse 2 - Chip Tha Ripper]
We up in this bitch we doin' extra extra well
If my album ever dropped I hope it extra extra sell
And every time you see me yes, oh yes I'm fresh as hell
And yes every hotel bet you yes it's gon' smell
Like a bunch of bonfires on the marijuana field
I said a bunch of bonfires on the marijuana field
Like I'm Foghorn Leghorn, said shit twice
So high up in the sky just might say some shit twice, nigga
And I'm from Saint Clair, comin' up was really hard
Nigga we was shootin' dice in kindergarten
Now people takin' pictures when we thought this really odd
Like we dressed like that man on Hollywood Boulevard
I feel the whole world's mine for the takin'
Smokin' on this plankton I got you all plankin'
Feelin' good, I ain't had this feelin' in a while
Penthouse hotel, fat bitch with the titties out
