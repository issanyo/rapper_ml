(feat. Tezo)
Wander way nigga don’t hate no more
Black on black my track is there
You nigga you tell no but
Black or black my track is there
Drop nigga some hores
You nigga you tell no but
You won’t need no drug
Drop nigga some hores
You nigga you tell no but
Way would you go back with cleaver boys
Cleaver boys
They can drive and can swim
I need more couple
It’s so wild for your pussy
Put there on my wall
Get on top of the bottom
They aren’t the same
Sometimes late in night
I talk to the Lord
He gave the swat
The shit in the bag
I said sometimes late in night
I talk to the mayor
He gave me the swat
The shit in the bag
Black on black my truck
You nigga you don’t tell but
Drop nigga some hores
Drop nigga some hores
Drop nigga some hores
