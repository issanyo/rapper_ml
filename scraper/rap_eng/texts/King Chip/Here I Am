Aight look

Soon to be the nigga on whatever
Drunk bullshittin, gettin nough chedder
Eatin good. Little feather weight
Alaskan crab legs on plates while I say grace
And unravel the napkin
Bon appetite ya little bitch. Why you snackin?
That and life is just a phase
So I puff the ill till I got a hi-top fade
I be all over the map. Rap. Im everywhere
Long as I got some hotel fare, hell yea I'm there
Turnpikes. We burn right and cloud surf
Bring me another ginger ale now, jerk
Is what some stuartists might testify. Oh this the guy
Is what I've always heard. This shit ain't nuthin new
I'm classified amongst niggas who do this beautiful music
He be spewin, representin, have you movin through ruins
Niggas is foolish. Middle man is out here scoopin that new shit
I rise above it. Niggas talkin, but really jivein? They nuthin
Gotta be fuckin kiddin me. Is you serious? Niggas crazy
Only one life to live and I ain't signin up for no slavery
Niggas gotten mistakin. Theys burnin, constantly bakin

My brain got me thinkin bout slowin down on that drinkin
My life long story told
Everything that glitters ain't gold
This shit'll grab you by your ankles when you try to run so you can't go
Contracts. Beyond that and case closed
Won't sign shit. We poppin with many options
We smoke and be poppin while you ponder
Bout life and your next move and transaction
He is a man, only if that man stackin
I'm doin sumthin. You can if you part of the new heights
New endevers, new levels, new days, new nights
Survival of the fittest. I'm a livin witness straight out the jungle
I just lost all my niggas
Man this shit is gettin outta hand. Must be part of Gods plan
Destroy and rebuild. That's why he put me on land

So here I am. Can't stop me on his arm, Jesus on his neck, ain't nobody harm. He dont rock a charm
Here I am. Can't stop me on his arm, Jesus on his neck, ain't nobody harm. He dont rock a charm
Here I am. Can't stop me on his arm, Jesus on his neck, ain't nobody harm. He dont rock a charm
Here I am. Niggas. Here I am
