Last night I had a dream, i woke up and thought a nigga shot me
Last night I had a dream, i woke up and thought a nigga got me
But I'm glad it was a nightmare, that i had when i was having conjuring
I've been living in a nightmare, every night [???]

(Chip wake up. My nigga wake up
Chip wake up. My nigga wake up.)

[Verse 1]
My inception is more perfect than perfection
My recollection is King Chips reflection
Having deju vu in my dreams, fuck does that mean
Even in my dreams, won't let you fuck with my team
I went to go shoot the nigga who killed Hawk
Parked the whip around the corner then got out and walked
So I'm standing in this driveway, chugging the brew
Let the tech 9 sing as i scream fuck you
His next door neighbor thought that he was under attack
A couple rounds hit his house, he came out with the mac
I did a Michael Vick, Jessie Owens, wylin ass, rolling, felt a tingle in my neck and in my chest i kept going
Got around the corner, hopped up in the hottie
Peeled off. Start coughing, couldn't stop coughing
Looked up in the mirror, i was [???]
Pulled the Buick over, said a prayer and then she woke me (She woke me)

(Chip wake up. My nigga wake up
Chip wake up. Wake up nigga!)

[Verse 2]
The next night i went to sleep and continued my dream
When i dozed off i woke up in that Buick and bleeding
I merely picked up where i left off
I'm half dead, on the hundred twenty fifth, and my stolen asset
Started feeling around for my phone to call for help
Might have to drive right to the Cleveland clinic myself
Damn this shit is starting to hurt, choking on blood
That nigga who just shot me is still coming on foot
Started panicking, then remembered still have some bullets left
Hurt to up the tec, but i up the tec let him feel it
Yeah i hit him but he was still coming and busting shots
Ducked down in the Buick but damn, nigga got shot
Another one to the back, I'm burning rubber
Hit a couple corners, started thinking about my mother
Wishing i could say bye to my son, dying lonely
I exhaled, said a prayer, then she woke me

[Hook]
Last night I had a dream, i woke up and thought a nigga shot me
Last night I had a dream, i woke up and thought a nigga got me
But I'm glad it was a nightmare, that i had when i was having conjuring
I've been living in a nightmare, every night [???]

(Thank God she woke me
Thank God she woke me
Cause a nigga thought he was gone
A nigga thought he was gone. On life)

[Hook]
Last night I had a dream, i woke up and thought a nigga shot me

But I'm glad it was a nightmare, that i had when i was having conjuring
