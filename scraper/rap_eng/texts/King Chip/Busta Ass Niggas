[Hook: Hit-Boy]
Fuck them busta ass niggas
Fuck them sucker ass niggas, you a ho
Fuck them busta ass niggas
Ask the world I'll show you what is in the ?

[Verse 1: Chip tha Ripper]
I can beat you to the punch or I could punch you to the beat
I keeps it two hundred thousand, real ones fuck with me
I got money, but ain't too flashy, only fuck with girls who nasty
Bitch, let me see one ass cheek, I'm still high from last week
Hate I don't respond to, I just come and find you
With your girl and your mom too, do what I gotta do like John Q
Compared to how I used to live, I'm rich as hell, extra good
You say if you had a shot, you would all net, bet you would
Hey bitch, do you take MasterCard or Visa
Okay come in, hop on this Leaning Tower of Pisa
Keep them things on us, nigga we don't pop trunks
I ain't ever been no bitch, I ain't ever been no punk
Got thirty seven hoes at my crib getting drunk
Got a crib downtown and I ain't been there in two months
Niggas is hoes, hating on us, just don't fuck around and get lit
Guarantee you when I see you, nigga, you ain't gon' be shit

[Hook (2X)]

[Bridge: Chip tha Ripper (4X)]
Niggas acting like hoes
Bitch we getting this dough

[Verse 2: Hit-Boy]
I'm all about mine, I'm all about grinding
You all about losing, bitch, we all about shining
I'm doing this shit for my family, my niggas, you'll never catch me in the drop
I want cribs as big as Texas, bitch, respect the Swisher house
Catch me on the top of the charts, or your girl
Either way I'm winning watch the throne, I'm dropping the world
And she lusting for Louis, she fucking for Fendi
She greedy for Gucci, it ain't no pretending
All my niggas gonna smoke to this
All my niggas gonna roll to this
All my bitches get high cuz we finna get fly, got me felling like Hov and shit
? big pimping now we on a boat
Somewhere off in the Pacific now we on the coast
Nigga we celebrating, sipping now we gotta toast
To all this fucking good living, now the struggle gone
Yeah we on, yeah we on and life was all so hard
Until I made a song called ball so hard
She don't wanna let me swipe, I'll use my Kanye card
Now she knows that I'm repping that G.O.O.D. Music
And it's just nothing to getting them drawers off

[Hook + Bridge]

[Verse 3: Bun B]
I sit on the side of the bed, smoking a blunt, counting my bread
Your bitch got her face in my lap going fed
And I'm tapping that, she's on top of her head
Yeah this is the life of a king, money and power, the lights and the bling
And my wife is a queen, look at me nigga, my life is a dream
You caught in the hype and it seems you think you like me, but nigga you ain't
So if you step to me wrong then I'll split your ass from the teeth to the taint
See, I've been in these streets and you can't just say what the fuck you gon do and don't do it
Say you want drama, we gon pursue it
Radiator gun be leaking that fluid
Fuck a hater and whoever came with him
I'll point the finger, then my niggas get him
After my niggas got him, he tossed in a river and sink to the bottom
When that body gets bottom
Sleep with the fish like Osama Bin Laden
Fuck boy, we ain't hiding
We at your broad, daylight and we riding
And my hat low and I'm sitting on fat, ho
Plus, I'm packing that gat so
Watch where you're walking like Ratso
Rizzo, extra street and these kids know
So do us all a favor and go mind your motherfucking biz, ho
