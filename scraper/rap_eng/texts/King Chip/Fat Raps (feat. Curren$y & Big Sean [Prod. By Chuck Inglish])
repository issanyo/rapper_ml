Chip Tha Ripper-
Uh-huh. SLAB ENT BOY. Good luckin out, chyeah
Pulled up to the hand-car wash like blao
Just the outside my nigga gon' wipe me down
Know i gotta couple dollars for you when you done
Roll the window back up, roll the blunt, cut UGK back up
Cut the AC back up; gettin kinda hot in here, Benny Hanna
Left-over weed, smokin, I'm in here
Let me volunteer to get you niggas minds right, getcha funds
Up instead of chasin after limelight
But since I'm all good I might, go and see whats good
With these pretty girls for one night. So I whipped around
To the spot I knew was poppy-in. Parked then we
Hopped out then hopped in, no problem. Soon as we got in
Eye brows raised up, I missed the tape with Fay Cut(?)
With the Escalade truck, in the party lookin for Miss-Not-
Too-Bougiese with a booty and know how to roll
Doobies and junk

Curren$y-
Bitches think I'm living out my car, all these shoe
Boxes and shit, don't confuse it boo, this stuff I
Just bought, before I came to scoop you, coulda
Dropped it off, but I wanted you to see it, confident
But not concieted
Yeah, I like my grapes, and my weed seedless
Gettin pussy with my fathers features, believe it
If you missed it, then I bet somebody out there seen
It, TwitPic my outfit, bitches stalk my comments
Just fool
What they say I came first on my list of things

To do(?). If the broad got wireless at her crib
I fall through. Gotta e-mails to read, as she
Break down my tree, reach my cell phone
Turn the TV down for me(yeah)
It was kinda ironic, cuz I had the papers
She had the chronic. The Hornets beat the
Supersonics. And hella vapors from the smokin
Volcano, I'm thirsty need some water, boy captain
Insane-o(?)

Big Sean-
Aye, in this lifetime you only get richer or not
So hoes jump for my balls like they tipped off
The rock. I get it from my dad cuz I'm a chip
Of the block. Now I'm up in Cleveland to grab
Chip off the block. Now whip off the lots, with
A bad bitch, ass thick, and tits so I slipped off
The top. Yeah, Bitch I'm the man, forever gettin
Chose, I party everynight and it's never gettin old
The story of your life is probably never gettin
Told, them tickets to your show is probably
Never gettin sold. I might just cop some shit
From some set, New York to LA, I beat the sunset
Your girl show me L-O-V-E. I dropped the O and
E, and just took the LV. Thats Louis Vuitton luggage
Everytime you see my passport, Domneyair(?) print
Got me lookin like a chessboard ahaha
