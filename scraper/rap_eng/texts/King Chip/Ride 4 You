Yeah, ooh girl, don't be silly, don't be stubborn, don't be spoiled, rotten
I know what you want, you got it coming
If you can't cooperate with the laws and the vision we could be really good friends
I know I can give you what you're missing
If you listen, the littlest things are so colossal
If you could treat my world like it's gold then boo I got you
You could be my homegirl lover, ain't no other
You ain't 'bout to wonder, I am here, I am down for you
If you act right, you know I got you

It's just a simple thing, a simple thing
Baby if you hold me down, baby if you hold me down
I will give you everything, everything
You could be my roll dog, I could be your homie

It's just a simple thing, a simple thing
Baby if you hold me down, baby if you hold me down
I will give you everything, everything
You could be my roll dog, I could be your homie

[Verse 2: Far East Movement]
My baby don't trip cause she on the grown tip
I keep her on the hush hush, treat her like my home chick
You know she rather die, living life on the edge
A million miles a minute living life no regrets

[Verse 3: Far East Movement]
Yo her friends they be texting sometimes, but I don't
Ever give them replies cause they won't
Ever have what we have
Our conversations are crack, the little face with your laugh
You've got me fiending for that that that

Tell me now who gon' ride for you, you know
Tell me now who gon' ride for you, yeah yeah
Tell me now who gon' ride for you, you know
