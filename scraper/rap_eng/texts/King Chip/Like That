Chorus:

Made it like that
I want it like that
I’m livin’ like that (X2)

Verse 1

They say money rule the world
Well I’m a hundred dollar bill
And I’m just lookin’ for a subtle spot to chill

Niggas crazy
Thinkin’ ‘bout today and not tomorrow
Hope they never have to borrow
Out here frontin’ like they (Made it like that)

But I don’t stress em’ I just keep pressin’ along
If I ain’t got no rolo’s then Case got the bong
And maybe take one to the face then I’m gone
Got these Louis’ on my face for the sun cuz I (Made it like that)

And everything I got i took it
Look at what we did
Passin’ out tapes at school to out of town paid gigs
Even older bitches want the kid like I’m Taye Diggs
Givin hoes their groove back

All I hear is heyyyy Chip
Hey bitches how you doin

And they flock to him
Cuz they know he won’t pursue it
Just do it if you want it
And don’t stop until you there

Damn Chip you poppin’ everywhere
That’s cuz I

[Hook]

Verse 2

Comin’ to you live
From a jungle full of pride
And drugs
Many lives taken from under these lights

With them Nike Air Flights
Been rollin’ up plenty nights
Was a whole lot of shots
And not too many fights

I was young, keepin’ up
With the niggas who was hatin’
Ain’t nobody gave us nathin’
Nigga we just had to take it naw

Little Stace got 38
Better smartin’ up
Lil’ Jon goin’ off
Yea we got some problems but

Prayin’ ask the Lord to stay
With you just another day
And if I die before I wake
Tell my niggas split my cake

Yea and just like 50 say
Cuz I can’t take it anyway
We livin’ in a different day than yesterday
And shit today

So what I gotta get today
Is paper in a different way
Condo fuck a crib
Cuz hey a window just a brick away?

Followed by, me fill in the blank
While I just stottle by
Up at 2 and 6?
I’m ‘bout to catch a flight to na na na

[Hook]
