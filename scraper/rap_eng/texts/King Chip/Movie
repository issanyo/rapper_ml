Dawg my life is like a movie (movie)
All of the cars, and places we are
All my girls look like them girls off in the movies (movies)
Jam - packed with action
I swear my niggas be packin them choppas that you see up in the movies (movies)
We do not pretend to be in the streets
This is documentary
My life like a movie (movie)
Dawg my life is like a movie (movie)

[Verse 1]
Volcano vaporizer, we higher
Dumb fresh, plus we kicks it like hi-yah
Call some ladies that is finer than Mya
With some ass, and don't be inviting them fuckin flat-tire ass hoes who wanna roll cause ain't nobody flyer
TV Screen, computer screen, word of mouth with the flyer
Fire another language, sound just like english
If you niggas is hot then call me MC Extinguish
And my fit be the meanest
And my whip be the cleanest
Told these hoes that a rubber is the only thing between this penis
Yeah, I got plenty of it
No you like it, no you love it
She catch amnesia in public
She be like nah, we just friends
I be gone in the wind
Sour diesel got a nigga dosing off again
My real life is like paid in full
I'm just a modern day ace for y'all

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
St. Claire state of mind when I'm on this grind
Real recognize real I seen myself a couple times
Baby why me, I'm prolly gon' be an asshole
She don't care, she just wanna pose when the flash goes
Jag, Rolls Royce, Lambo's, Austin's, Lotus, Focus
And just try to be the dopest
Blue magic pouring out of my pores
Tongue full with fungus spores
The front row subject to my illness and more
Chilling on tours just to get the music further
I'm treadind water
Tryna stay afloat but I don't have a boat
And don't need one
I'm the one
I'm what you niggas sleeping on
Cudder was one of the only to hold me down so we dreaming on
Pretty good unfold the poster
I'm doind the can't stop hand to my mouth talking bout blowing doja
To the world
All 7 continents got the shit
Realest niggas here and we shining all over your counter
