[Verse 1: Smoke DZA]
I'm a king bitch, really though, I mean really though
Kushed god signs everywhere he go
You don't know, ask around maybe Siri know
Royalty, everywhere he go
One man band but the nights on deck
Coming through with the semi, no Arsenio
I got many flows, they semi-pro
Jackie Moon niggas can't fuck with Derrick Rose
Who are you nigga, you ain't never get no dough
You can fool them, but you ain't really like that though
Classic tapes, massive flows
Something that the game missing
Tell these rap niggas that they in too deep, and they fucking with dwayne Giddens
Got a low spot with nothing but low up in it
Low mug, and I pour up in it
I'm a marijuana activist but this Activis got me leaning like slow up nigga
Take caution talking cause I'm made
Niggas never caught a fade
If it ain't ? then this the spades
Tip a hundred to the waiter cause a nigga getting paid

[Hook: Smoke DZA]
Right, right, right
I heard these niggas wanted weed raps
So here's another weed rap, right
Heard these niggas wanted weed raps
So here's another weed rap, right
Heard these niggas wanted weed raps
So here's another weed rap, right

[Verse 2: King Chip]
Yeah, King Chip in this ho swagging on them
Styling on 'em, straight whylin' on 'em
I ain't want to have to get violent on 'em
But they bitch ass should have stayed silent homie
Know a nigga burn that frosted bush
Got a ounce for the next two hours
Know a nigga smoke about a pound a day
Nigga roll up them frosted flowers
Damn right we gon' floss with ours
Nigga better know what day it is
She said what's your name boo?
I said whatever I say it is
Call me King Chip, my son the prince
'For I give him Ritalin , then I give him kush
Doctor prescribed it so it's alright
If they hating then tell them shush
Buy copy cribs, copping whips
Showing up on red carpet shit
Damn I don't need a key to start the whip
Always valet, never parking bitch
Cloud of smoke fresh out the whip
All this money I got to get
Tell the bitch quit playing, I got the hip
Yo, King Chip gon' smoke that shit

[Hook]
