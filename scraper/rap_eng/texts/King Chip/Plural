[Intro]
Uh two going at once
I like my girls like I like my blunts (simultaneous)
And that's two going at once

[Verse 1]
Check
Headed to the beach
Me and two pretty girls from the East
Ice in the cooler with Patron and the 'Rossi
Mix em up, we call it Patrossi
Louis cover up the eyes on all us
It's a nice day we should be cooling by some water
Sipping, smoking, conversating 'bout what we be thinking bout
I tell them shorties not to believe all of the shit they read about
Fresh out the college, they peoples got dollars
They amazed by my ill street knowledge
I forewarn them, 'bout the underworld they never saw
They pretty asses had no idea
They both had often told me stories, about childhood, good living
I could relate now but coming up I wasn't winning
We chilling, 'bout to get fried
Flat screen in my Teepee, Miami Ocean Drive

[Hook]
Two going at once
I like my girls like I like my blunts (whenever, however)
And that's two going at once
Two going at once (whenever, wherever)
Two going at once
I like my girls like I like my blunts (whenever, wherever)
And that's two going at once (yeah)
Two going at once

[Verse 2]
Uh - they both roll nice
Light 'em both up, take flight
Hell naw I ain't getting in that water
They both got bikinis on ass oh my God uh
They both ran off, I watched from afar
They kind of touchy-feely, on each other underwater
But that water much clear so I can see all that
Should take em up to the 'telly be a part of all that
But we do that, yeah that so I'm gon' fall back
Light one up not on my mind now what you call that
Mo' girls arrive, to my surprise
They had a bag of 'shrooms and kush and didn't bring no guys
Here we go, get ready good thoughts and flat colors
Everything dance with the music I love it
We in abundance, I'm the man I suppose
Headed to the suite to wash all the sand out my toes
And they coming too

[Hook]
