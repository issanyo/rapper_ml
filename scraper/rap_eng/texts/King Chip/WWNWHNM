[Verse 1]
They burnt up LeBron jersey cause they love that nigga
Held that nigga down, put no one above that nigga
You had a fight with yo girl because you love that bitch
You in the club lookin' mean on yo mug cause blood got rich
You still drivin' that same Mazda, you still ain't shit
Mad niggas getting bags of cash, ain't give you shit
All them hours you spent, mad at me cause I'm shinin'
Could've been grindin', could've been flyin'
All the way cross the world like I am (Dumbass)
Bitch ass nigga don't hate on me because I'm using my brain
Bitch ass nigga, might as well just take a few notes, start doing the same (bitch)
You that nigga known for hatin' real heavy
You's a ho (ho)
Yo kids should be ashamed of they daddy
They wonder

[Verse 2]
They gone understand they hate, I understand I'm great
Success â€“ that's that bait, oh these haters can't wait
Stress come from giving a fuck, I'm carefree, I'm livin
Damn I shoulda been dead, few times could've went to prison
How the fuck you niggas hatin' on me? Everything you got was given
How we deal with haters around my way? Nigga we just kill em
You probably sittin' next to a hater right now and you ain't even know it
That's why I tuck that 40 mane
Blow yo head off and keep going
Hate come from love, they all wanna live like this
They all want a crib like this
And if they got one they ain't pissed
These haters hate themselves
They wish they had a chance
They complain every day at work, on they lunch breaks to they friends
