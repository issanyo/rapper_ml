[Intro: Naledge]
It's so beautiful, it's so lovely, it's so gutterant, it's so ugly
Love me or hate me, ya'll can't break me cause ya'll ain't make me
[Beat starts]
Some how, you can turn nothing into something though
I'm so cool man
Flyer than giraffe pussy

[Verse 1: Naledge]
School boy fresh back with Mr Light Saber
Cook food for thought, these fruits of the labor
Off my high horse. Pop up like screen savers
Fresh off the plane, from broad, high haters
Raisin the bar, I don't need a spot
Fuck a cosign, you can see him hot
Nigga Honor me
Purple heart rhyme veteran this is special auto shit
Turn hoes on like late night letterman
Top of the line, nigga state of the art
This is high straight world wide
My style 740 7 lear jet fly
Ya'll read swagger for dummies
My aura naturally disiminates from me
Underground Pimp C, Bun B in a Polo Rugby
Raps child play and I feel like, chuck you
And don't it sound so lovely?

[Hook]
How high? So high I ain't never coming down, how fly? So fly I reside in the clouds. How sick? So sick that they on my dick. You alladat? Yeah I'm alladatshit
How high? So high I ain't never coming down, how fly? So fly I reside in the clouds. How sick? So sick that they on my dick. Everybody say hello to Mr. Alladatshit

[Verse 2: Donnis]
I be like hello? hello? hello? Dingo
Where in the world is Donna San Diego?
Hoppin off the plane, Trinidad and Tobago
Study geography but you never know where we go
Crazy like C Low, excuse me Gnarly Barkley
She left me but I still need bail, Charles Barkley
Now I got chick that says I'm totally narly
She from CA, I call her Malibu Barbie
Stewart on the barbie
Calls me Raekwon the chief
When your foods in the stove, in 30 minutes or less
They say hip hops dead but I swear these niggas deaf
Cause baby girl thirsty, I'm still sucking on her chest
So this is RIP, for weak MCs
I am everything that these niggas wish they could be
I am rap I am hip hop, I'm a mother fucking hit
So when I'm done you can say goodbye to alladatshitttttttt

[Hook]
How high? So high I ain't never coming down, how fly? So fly I reside in the clouds. How sick? So sick that they on my dick. You alladat? Yeah I'm alladatshit
How high? So high I ain't never coming down, how fly? So fly I reside in the clouds. How sick? So sick that they on my dick. Everybody say hello to Mr. Alladatshit

[Verse 3: Chip Tha Ripper]
Chip bone
Double O I be so, in it
Oh yeah that's my MO
Bitches tell me buy em drink, I just tell em N-O
Fucking with my money, you must not know what you in fo
Cockin back and punchin niggas out like I was Kimbo
Market Jacob shades make the bitches smoke em stolo
Sip that ace of spades but don't get that on my Polo
Hood niggas, we just got a whole bunch of finesse
Cleveland is my city
St Clair we the best
Diamonds on my chest, check my polo vest
5 hundred for those Gucci shoes ain't nothing less
In other words I can dress, I got money I'm a spend it hoe
Fuck if you ain't in it for the stuntin, then what you in it for?
I be on that cool shit, cooler than a Heineken
Is she cute? And not how many fellas she can bring a friend
All them hoes be telling me, I'm something like celebrity
And when I wear them Gucci shades
I wonder if you can tell it's me?
