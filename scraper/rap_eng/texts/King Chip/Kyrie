Damn, Menace got beats

[Chorus: Trinidad James]
You can't check me (I feel like)
You can't check me (I feel like)
You can't check me (I feel like)
You can't check me (I feel like)
You can't check me (I feel like)
You can't check me (I feel like)
You can't check me (I feel like)
You can't check me (I feel like)

[Chorus: Trinidad James]
I feel like I'm Kyrie, you know you can't check me
Move like I'm Kyrie, you know you can't check me
I feel like I'm Kyrie, you know you can't check me
Move like I'm Kyrie, you know you can't check me

[Verse 1: Trinidad James]
Check, check, check, check, check, you can't check me
Niggas double-crossing like it's soccer, call 'em Messi
Multi-colored money, that shit look like a canary
I am not the homie, no my nigga, we not friendly
You are not a gangster, pussy nigga, you just [?]
Dripping YSL but the gagos might be Fendi
I set my own trends, I don't follow what is trending
I keep a few thousand for unnecessary spendings
24s on my ride, I feel like I'm Kobe
Slap a nigga with the left, I feel like Gin√≥bili
Niggas want rings man, niggas want trophies
Niggas know my name but, these niggas don't know me
These niggas don't know me, I know
I know that she want me, I know
These niggas can't check me, I know
I know, I know

[Chorus: Trinidad James]
You can't check me (I feel like)
You can't check me (I feel like)
You can't check me (I feel like)
You can't check me (I feel like)
You can't check me (I feel like)
You can't check me (I feel like)
You can't check me (I feel like)
You can't check me (I feel like)

[Chorus: Trinidad James]
I feel like I'm Kyrie, you know you can't check me
Move like I'm Kyrie, you know you can't check me
I feel like I'm Kyrie, you know you can't check me
Move like I'm Kyrie, you know you can't check me

[Verse 2: King Chip]
Yeah, I'm too cold, you can't check me
You ain't got enough to pay me, you can't check me
Anywhere I go, bitches gon' select me
Watch your mouth bro, none of your lame ass niggas could check me
I'm pullin' up sexy, I'm givin' no fuck 'bout [?] niggas, I'm pullin' up flexing
No that's not alligator my nigga, bro that's T-Rex be
Got too many hoes, I got Brini confused with Lexi
If you not finna go crazy, bae don't even text me
We won the Championship so bitch go 'head, undress me
Pulled up so fly, hopped out, police try to 'rest me
I spin-movin' cross these hoes over if they stress me
Get shot from halfcourt but just now you try to press me
Yeah, try me
Yeah, you can't keep up with me like I'm Kyrie
Yeah, you can't buy me air, you can't get by me
Go wait in the lobby, you can't check me, you ain't got me, you can't stop me

[Chorus: Trindad James]
You can't check me (I feel like)
You can't check me (I feel like)
You can't check me (I feel like)
You can't check me (I feel like)
You can't check me (I feel like)
You can't check me (I feel like)
You can't check me (I feel like)
You can't check me (I feel like)

[Chorus: Trindad James]
I feel like I'm Kyrie, you know you can't check me
Move like I'm Kyrie, you know you can't check me
I feel like I'm Kyrie, you know you can't check me
Move like I'm Kyrie, you know you can't check me
