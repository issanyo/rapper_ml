[Verse 1: King Chip]
King Chip up in this ho
Fresh up out the liquor store
Swagging, if you didn't know
Yeah, I bet them bitches know
Know a nigga straight up out the hood on Wikipedia
King Chip you fucking looney all up in the media
Straight up out the ghetto with the knowledge of a oracle
Most these rap niggers is some ho's, how the story go
Up until age 19, I was very po'
Started selling raps moved right up out the ghetto fo'
St. Clair Ave, that's where you get your head bust
Seen a lot of shit, when I was young I never said much
Only if I knew you, would I be all on some cool shit
Seen a lot of my nigga's dead on the pool pit
I could get my hands on the blam in a heartbeat
Only when you had no fear of death, do you start beef
I'd seen some nigga's, getting hunted like some fucking deer
Wonder why I have no heart, that's all I known for all my years
Nigga's know, make it out my hood on some rap shit
Therefore, I am legend living fantastic
If you roll a nice one, motherfucker pass it
Light my air mags up before you drop the casket
Yeah, King Chip
If you roll a nice one, motherfucker pass it
Light my air mags up before you drop the casket

[Verse 2: GLC]
GLC, The Ism is a visionary
Seen my face next to Ism in the dictionary
These pussy ass lames, they just can't compare me
My bitches they just don't complain when they gotta share me
I was 16 when I got a Chevy
Came up from a pack to a fucking heavy
Gospel, talk to apostles
Who you know that knew that shit and fuck like Costco
I know, the truth will get you goofy niggas
Holding nigga's balls, y'all some groupie niggas
Flexing and finessin', riding hoopty niggas
I be manifesting [ - ] sushi nigga
Cool out, that silk shit I rule out
Chip got it cracking out in Cleveland, so I flew out
Got these hoes going down low, like a lou out
I'm about that money and the power, what is you 'bout

[Verse 3: Chevy Woods]
I'm balling' just like John Walk
Bitch, call me the wizard!
Couple years before, you know a nigga had that wizard
White T from the corner store was my shizzurt
Breaking angles, cross serve, I know that it hizzurt
Fresh from the corner, smell the fiends I was chilling in
I was smoking Kush up in them hotels in Michigan
What'd you think I came from? Lil niggas pressed for time
When you hear G speak, hurry up and press rewind
All we do is cash checks, I be in them'  Bo Jacks
Ten in the rubber band, no less, I need 90 back
Mind of an old nigga, tell the ' is fully you
With your point guard ass, you ain't never try to shoot!
Niggas saying won't you just play something that I'm nice
Pussy niggas, what's your bet? Nigga, I don't need the price
I keep it Pittsburgh nigga, but it's weekend
Chip said it got it popping, quit traffic to Cleveland

[Outro]
Light my air, light my air mags up before you (repeats)
Light my air mags up before you drop the casket
Light my air, light my air mags up before you (repeats)
