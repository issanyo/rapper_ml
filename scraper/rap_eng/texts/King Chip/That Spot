[Verse 1: Chip Tha Ripper]
Baby girl 5'6"
Fine, thick
She had to be like a size 5 or 6
I met her at the mall right in front of footlocker
My nigga bet me 20 I couldn't get her so I
Walked in like I was about to buy something
And got to looking around like I couldn't find nothing
She walked back in got to looking at her ass
Then I asked if she had these in 11 and a half
She was like "ooh baby I don't work here"
Then I put the shoe back and I said I knew that
She smiled and got to walkin to the door
But I couldn't let her go so I walked te door too
Then I said "come on my niggas lets go
Pretty girls ain't giving out their number's no more"
Then I turned around looked at her and she laughed again
Tapped me on the shoulder
And she asked if I had a pen
I said "yea theres one in back a my trio"
She pulled out her razor I said
"I'll trade ya!"
Her screen saver said "niggas ain't shit"
Thats funny because mine said "money over a bitch"
I said "I'll call ya"
She said "You better"
Collected $20 from my nigga
Then later on got her on the phone like "wait til gettcha"
She like "what makes you so special?"

[Verse 2: Chip Tha Ripper]
We was on the phone until the early morn
I was just trying to see what this girly on
I said "I'm digging you" and she was digging me too
Baby look familler think I saw her at the view
I was like girl you should be my boo
She was like "ohh daddy can I come through?"
I was like "cool" then I told her where I live
She said she be over by 1O and its 9:45
So that don't really leave me much time to clean up the crib n chill a bottle a wine
Then she rang and I buzzed her in told her come to apartment 210
Magnum on deck for when its time to suite up lit up the booty and does it defiantly do up
Put a movie in but she really didn't care
She looking at me and I'm looking at her
She touching on me and I'm touching on her
Then she started kissing hair
"girl, you betta quit that shit before you fuck around and get that shit"
She was like "nigga please"
"I ain't met a nigga who can satisfy me and honestly I don't think you can hang with me"
"I'm gonna need 2 hours, baby, mabye even 3!"
I said "Baby, time is of the essence you need someone to deliver a package and not a message"
"And I'm the UPS man, I go the extra mile"
"I delever with a smile, been delivering for a while"
So be cool because I know what I'm doing
Panties and bra is what I want to see you in
Then we can just minus the panties and bra
Massage your thighs and just add this cannon with balls
And any other problems I can solve em
Even if you just need a massage I got you
We can take it real slow at the beginning
Keep them coochie lips a grinning when I hit it from behind
Then pop goes the weasel
Because the weasel goes pop all over your head, shoulders, knees and toes
But I bet you I don't even get to finish
I'mma have you tapping out in 30 minutes
Because I know where that spot at girl!
