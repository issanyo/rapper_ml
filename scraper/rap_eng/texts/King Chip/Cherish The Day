[Verse 1]
24/7 I’m Coachelin' in heaven
Heaven is what you make it
Some earn and some take it
Keepin' it real, no fake it til you make it, that’s some ho shit
Don’t listen to all advice cause most niggas don’t know shit
Roll up my nigga, (Cherish the day)
Shout out to all my fam doin the best they can
Don’t settle for less my nigga, just come up with better plan
Don’t be too quick to call these new niggas yo friends
On a roll and this one hope it don’t take me up out the solar system
All against 'em, have no future, they best to born with 'em
Please don’t step on these Michaels they ain’t available yet
We ever so fresh, tell these reckless hood niggas that’s ready for death
That’s why we (Cherish the day)
We leaders like Nas and Damien Marley
Aim to be wise and stop putting all that poison in my body
I swear I’m on that shit like right after this party
So ready, set, go, we spoke to the people
We told em that all go upward we go
I’m down with the plus sign, nigga fuck evil
Consecutive blunts smoking til I PO
Take it slow, that’s how I...

Cherish the day

[Verse 2: Domo Genesis]
It’s like I hustle so hard to keep lunch on the table
All this hard work and this is how they fuckin repay you
Compared to what? These niggas suck
How the fuck if the play you? You think you lucky but you drunk
Getting fucked by yo label, got the mentality
Never had shit to prove, so in turn it ain’t shit lose
Be that follower shit from fools, me I’m burning the book of rules
Want moves? Get you bruised by young dudes with 22’s
Weak dudes, so confused, play it cool, you get to choose
I ain’t no slave but I’m out here in the field, nigga
If I get killed today at least I went a real nigga
But I ain’t planning on leaving, my seat back and I’m chiefin
I sleep after I’m breathing, I bleed rap for a reason
I tried to tell these niggas about my prophecy (
All inked out, now these niggas wanna copy me
Thoughts came out, who'd a  thought I had a lobotomy?
Honestly only policy, mobbing deep, work the prodigy
Shook niggas, fuck is you talking? It ain’t no stopping me
Morphine flow, it’s like I’m spittin out some policies
Ain’t a nigga allowed to speak? Who is hot as me?
I kick the rap game in the face, say no apologies

Cherish the day
