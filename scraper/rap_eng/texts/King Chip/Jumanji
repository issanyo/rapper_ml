[Verse 1]
I keep it super cool, I don't fuck with these niggas
Compare that shit to 99' you see the big difference
These niggas is some bitches, that's just how I feel
You say you cut from a different cloth well bitch I'm cut from steel
Make a phone call get you tough niggas killed
Niggas hating' on the net when I know where they live
Got a big list of some hungry hood niggas
Send 'em to yo house while I'm out of town chillin'
Cavs took an L and the browns ain't winning
The whole city bidding', ain't not a soul grinning'
On top of that niggas still getting' shot down
Total anarchy ain't too far fetched now
The city where the sun always hides behind them clouds
When the time ain't no love in this whole fucking town
Don't drive too fast on St. Clair slow down
Get yo kids in the house it's about to go down

[Hook 1]
Yeah, roll the window down and get to bustin'
I don't give a fuck about too much of nothin'
(Hey come on this nigga crazy)
Roll the window down and get to bustin'
I don't give a fuck about too much of nothin'
(Ayo come on this nigga crazy)
Roll the window down and get to bustin'
I don't give a fuck about too much of nothin'... Jumanji..

[Verse 2]
Well if it go down, while I'm on this earth very promptly
And everyday I'm watching out for niggas tryna hunt me
For what I got, real necessities, clothes
Food, a home niggas don't got those
Shit is fucked up, I stay with my uzi booked back
Fully clips you can't do nothin' to me
I grabbed this vest off this dead cop I saw laying on East 9th
All black Escalade you know I ain't think twice
Took that me and my crew some niggas we got are new
They survived, either get a gun or you through
Either you lucky or not so lucky, one of the two
If you normally shine then niggas is coming for you
Imagine familar faces demanding yo last shit
Pistol to yo upper lip and yeah they might blast it
Drastic, this shit is book of Eli
God bless the earth, please don't let me die

[Hook 2]
Tonight when I roll the windows down and get to bustin'
I don't give a fuck about too much of nothin'
(Hey come on this nigga crazy)
Roll the window down and get to bustin'
I don't give a fuck about too much of nothin'
(Ayo come on this nigga crazy)
Roll the window down and get to bustin'
I don't give a fuck about too much of nothin'... Jumanji...
