[Hook: King Chip]
Shout out to the bay
Yeah, tonight we in the bay
Shout out to the bay
King Chip nigga Cleavland  all day
Shout out to the bay
King Chip nigga Cleavland all day
Shout out to the bay
Yeah tonight we in the bay

[Verse 1: King Chip]
Girl, you already know what I'm on
You should put it on your tongue while your sliding down your thong
Let me hit it in the bathroom, I know we in the club
Why you dressed like that, if you weren't trying to fuck
Your friend getting jealous tell her she can join in
Cut the lights off now you look like twins
Girl got the minge, girl you musn't see the Benz
Ten hoes at the crib and you know they all tens
It's a bunch of Louie bags, bitches came to get it in
Now she naked in the pool telling me to dive in
Got a bunch of girls here, right amount of niggas
Man these hoes going HAM choosing up all the winners
Smoking upstairs on the couch with some freaks
So when you get it when you pass blunt fuck with chief
Some bitches at my crib that I ain't even meet
Probably been here for a week
Probably fuck and we  didn't even speak

[Hook: King Chip]
Shout out to the bay
And it's going in the eight like its going in the bay
Shout out to the bay
And you know what they say [?]
Shout out to the bay
Cleveland thats the city where you know they don't play
Shout out to the bay
We got some hoes in the bay

[Verse 2: RiFF RAFF]
Hold up folks
Shark-skin coat
Pull up working oak
In the yacht-style boat
Lobster biscotti
Drive a big body
Should I do karate
Valet park the Maserati
First off, license registration
All this ice on my chest, figured I was a figure skater
Figuratively speaking mentally on vacation virtual verbatim
I beg your pardon swing to Olive Garden
Now I'm with your daughter in the karma Aston Martin
Used to park cars, now five stars
Gave you a Swedish massage in my seven car garage
Got nice hips, vice grip lips
Me and King Chip flip Versace rice bricks
Now I'm in the mix like salad dressing
All this wood wheel molesting got my four five Glock testing

[Hook: King Chip]
Shout out to the bay
And you know the Memphis kid going HAM everyday
Shout out to the bay
From Oakland to Sactown like Pac say
Shout out to the bay
Now bring it to Chicago and swing to to PA
Shout out to the bay
Yeah, tonight we in the bay
