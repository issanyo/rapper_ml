[Hook: King Chip]
Lipstick on the blunts, her jeans on the floor
If a nigga was hatin' we wouldn't know
Haters can' afford to be goin' where we go
We on the top floor, just me and these hoes
Lipstick on the blunts, her jeans on the floor
If a nigga was hatin' we wouldn't know
If a nigga was hatin' we wouldn't know
Shit, we wouldn't know

[Verse 1: King Chip]
Baby girl cold yet she always stay hot
Lil' mama fresh, everyday she extra fly
Lil' shorty bad, she make all the bitches mad
Light skin chick with a dark skin swag
Lil' mama cold, yeah she get my vote
Not only is she bad but she got the convo
We should get in jacuzzis smokin' less than time blow
Told her dig in the movie that's the perfect combo
Got the molly with the lean and the weed in this ho
You not late if you've never seen this before
Hotel room, hella cheese on the floor
Ass so fat can't breathe in this ho
We up in New York and I'm feelin' like Cam
Me and two bitches in NY goin' HAM
Lipstick on the blunts, her jeans on the floor
If a nigga was hatin', shit we wouldn't know

[Bridge: King Chip]
We-we-we-we-we-we wouldn't know
If a nigga was hatin', shit we wouldn't know
We-we-we-we-we-we wouldn't know
If a nigga was hatin', shit we wouldn't know
We-we-we-we-we-we wouldn't know
If a nigga was hatin', shit we wouldn't know
We-we-we-we-we-we wouldn't know
If a nigga was hatin', shit we wouldn't know

[Verse 2: Casey Veggies]
Yeah, what it is? I'm on the scene
Me and Chip in the Vette lookin' hella clean
From the fit to my whip this my newest 'zine
New swagger, hoes hit radder
Livin' life backwards, grew up kinda faster
My homie was a bastard, my girl was a track star
My nigga was a gangsta, why you tryin' act hard?
My life Anita Baker, caught up in the rapture
But tonight I'll let it go girl, I'm poppin' Patron
Gettin' dough on the low don't let nobody know
If they hatin' on us, you wouldn't know
If it don't feel right, I wouldn't go
Baby girl I'm at the crib, you could come through
You know that I'mma run through
Give your ass a run through, you can't let it go now
Tell me what you gonna do, I'm doin' what I'm supposed to
