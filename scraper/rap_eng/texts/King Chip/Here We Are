[Verse 1]
Sup lonely girl with the expectations way too high
Ever think about why you lonely you should switch it up tonight
You should loosen up tonight
You should be cool dont put up no fight
You should give me some butt tonight
You might as well not give a fuck tonight
Got my niggas in here
Everything on me
But we all got bread
Young boss young gee
Got a cold young bitch
She got a brand new whip
Vallet back to back
Black on black
Racks on Chip

[Hook]
