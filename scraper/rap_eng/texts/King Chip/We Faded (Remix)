Nigga we faded
Nigga, we faded
Nigga, nigga, we faded
We faded
Nigga, we faded


[Verse 1]
I just woke up with a blunt in my mouth from the previous night
My [?] is filtered, best believe what I'm breathing is right
How bout a dab instead of some dap, and how bout a bitch on my lap
How bout I put Cleveland all on my back, and take that bitch all through the map
Drop that ass, don't spill that drink
Let a real nigga feel that pink
If I was to steal on you what would you think?  You wouldn't have no time to think
That hater mad, cause I'm getting paid faster than he can blink
That's fake leather, that's a vegan mink
High, King Chip need a shrink
I'm on Michigan Ave. in the Chi gettin' high
Now we on the PJ, and I ain't gonna lie
Lotta shit nigga tryin' to before he die
Might as well start by going to the sky
And she want a nigga who cake up, she want to tell all her friends bout the break up
Hope you can see through the make up, the next morning you wake up, that bitch look like Jacob
And how is you mad every time that I'm happy, huh, nigga you hatin'
I'm three hours late for my 3-some, they hit me like 'nigga we waitin'
She was so good with her tongue, the hair on my balls is fittin to be braided
I murdered them cunts, we burned a few blunts, now nigga we faded
