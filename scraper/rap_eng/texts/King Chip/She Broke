[Hook]
She bad but she broke
Yeah

[Verse 1]
Ass so fat its like a joke
Fuck facebook im tryna poke
Im tryna stay focused on my craft
Every time she pass I be focused on that ass
Rich niggas to broke dimes whats the ratio
Im on the receiving end of fellatio
She got kicked out her parents house no place to go
Damn shame this bitch 28 years old
Its a lotta dimes that ain't worth 2 cents
At my crib actin like she ain't tryna do shit
She need a nigga with some bread
Shes sick of givin broke niggas head
She think she too good for a job
She even set a couple ballas up to get robbed
Yeah thats how them broke bitches do it
If you dont call her yeah then shell call you

[Hook]
She bad but she broke

[Verse 2]
Yeah, we in France baby girl this ain't Cleveland
Ass so fat I stop breathin
Let me grab my inhaler
We did it all night now she lookin for a favor
The weed on me, we blazin
She think she got me good [?]
Naw I ain't gone save them
They all want a nigga thats paid and amazing
Before I came through you was browsin the dollar menu
Now you got filet mignon and salmon in you
Should I stop right there or should I continue
Sometimes I keep it too real boo did I offend you
Im at the bar like wait a minute hold on
She came in with her girlfriend clothes on
And her perfume so strong
Think Id rather be alone for the night so long
