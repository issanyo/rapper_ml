Black on black, Black on black (x6)

Chorus:
At night my hood is black on black (x2)
All my straps is black on black
I swear to God, all my straps is black on black
At night my hood is black on black (x2)
Nigga, my whip is black on black
My lifestyle is black on black

Verse 1:
A nigga so extra cold, never gave a fuck about a bitch, gave a fuck about these hoes
Ridin' in the Clair on 4s, sliding down 105 looking for my nigga with the bows
Business, on my nigga Holyfield, coming up the sto now got em in the whip, we gone
Copped my nigga a bottle cuz he on papers and he can't smoke that strong
See me on 117th, see me on 115th, see me on 112th
See a nigga on the 8th, don't come around Sellers my nigga that's bad for your health
Nigga hit a left on Ablewright, damn I miss my nigga Hawk
I could remember back in the day where they used to outline bodies on Shaw
Damn a nigga really from the ghetto (Start down Lakeview)
Nigga finna hit Wade Park
Niggas on 93rd in the game, on fuck niggas that's where that drama start
I got robbed on 79th but I got bread so it's all good
Yeah bitch I'm from Cleveland, if you ain't never been robbed then you ain't from the hood
Lost my Grandma Rose, lost so many of my niggas they casket closed
Lotta my niggas turned hoes
Coming up, King Chip got cash for gold
Black on black, black Morpheus
Pills on deck, black Morpheus
This night life is, but we create what's in store for us (King Chip)

Chorus:
At night my hood is black on black (x2)
All my straps is black on black
I swear to God, all my straps is black on black
At night my hood is black on black (x2)
Nigga, my whip is black on black
My lifestyle is black on black
