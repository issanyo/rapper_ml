[Verse 1]
I took over your town, kings get the crown
I'm sipping on that actavis, a nigga damn near drowned
Girl you know I need that crown, light skin or brown
Armenian, Latino, bitches known to blow it down
Got a black and Asian stallion, bad bitch from Sweden
Hair extra blonde head bouncing while she eat it
Her friend is Norwegian, that means she's from Norway
She said let's do it your way she crowned me in the doorway

[Hook]
That crown
You know I need that crown
Your boyfriend is a clown
Maybe that's why you around
I'm a king I need that crown
Girl gimmie that crown
The show is going down
I'm a king I need that crown
Bitch drop it to the ground
You know I need that crown
Your boyfriend is a clown
Maybe that's why you around
I'm a king I need that crown
Girl gimmie that crown
The show is going down
I'm a king I need that crown

[Verse 2]
I'm a king bitch, Aladeen bitch
Off with your head real quick cause you don't mean shit
We at Katanas with some queens who gon' do the team
Fuck them hoes with morals we gon' live this life and hit the scene
Only fuck with chicks who look like they model for Maybelline
This is how we living real life lord this ain't no dream
She know I'm tied in she want to get to know my clique
The lipstick that your bitch put on this morning is now on my dick

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Guys fuck in that all black
Forty on me nigga fall back
2 perfect tens in that all black
And they know these niggas is all whack
Please don't think I'm cashing out on hoes that shit is dead
Them red bottoms mean nothing if you ain't 2 steps ahead
Got that hash got that wax
Tell your boyfriend to relax
Bitch you know I'm after these racks
I'mma stay paid dropping these facts
Drop your head into my lap
Fuck you know about that?
Tell em King Chip is back
Tell em to french kiss my sack

[Hook]
