[Hook]
They love to see you down
Oh how they love to see you down
They love to see you down
Oh how they love to see you down

[Verse 1]
Yeah, the people love to see you down when you got the bread
Try to take a nigga crown right off of his head
Niggas love the bullshit like Charlemagne
Then they tryna lie and say “It’s part of the game”
Niggas with the cameras rolling when you real love it
Keep the cameras rolling, try snitchin’ on video
Yeah you might be listening but you ain’t hear me though
I fuck with lotta niggas I try not to keep a [?]
Dolo, negativity is lucrative
And I keep paying the cable bill to watch a bunch of stupid shit
People mad, talking shit but they ain’t doing shit
Must be human nature to conquer and ruin shit
They call it destroy and rebuild
If you tellin’ how it is, they say “Boy you need to chill”
They catch you at your lows, they gon’ feel me
But that’s a whole ‘nother world, it’s shit you gotta deal with

[Hook]
They love to see you down
Oh how they love to see you down
They love to see you down
Oh how they love to see you down

[Verse 2]
Damn, they wanna see how you react to the nonsense
For sure they wanna see you caught up with that lime bitch
You know they wanna see you broke with your feelings
How they wanna see you mad, wanna see you go the nigga route
It’s entertaining when you’re in pain
And it’s entertaining when your whole world cave in
The whole world is a bunch of hoes
Bitter sweet lifestyle when you got a bunch of O’s
Couple two, three commas in the bank
Got them commas in the safe and I gotta keep it safe
They just wanna see you in the race
They don’t wanna see you win, they just wanna see you race
Yeah they want the content but they ain’t buying shit
They rather see you on some bump shit than some fly shit
They hope you fall right off the stage at the award show
They wanna see the hit and camera footage when the door close

[Hook]
They love to see you down
Oh how they love to see you down
They love to see you down
Oh how they love to see you down

[Hook]
They love to see you down
Oh how they love to see you down
They love to see you down
Oh how they love to see you down
