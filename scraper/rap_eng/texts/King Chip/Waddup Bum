Slab niggas make the hoes go dumb
Gettin' hella change so we call each other bum

Verse 1

Fuck them other niggas yo I'm good I don't need 'em
I'm on the grind see the sparks fly when you lead 'em

Louis V’s, gold coins, DC’s, and your chick with me
Get busy nigga, board slide or the 50-50
And we ain't get no tricks, just licks
And we ain't gettin' no top score for this

Probably me and two chicks
That end up at ruth chris
Niggas 'bout to jump on they steak like "who's this"
Keep them hoes trickin' talk about I wanna be with you
Check a young nigga swag, you could learn a thing or two

I shine at night like the bathroom light
When you with me we can hit any club you like

But really I'm just a low key
Nigga who smoke weed
And be so clean
Just like all of my homies

Chorus:

Waddup Bum (yes), waddup bum
Waddup bum (yes), waddup bum
You look cold bum
Oh fo' sho', too fresh
Now where the hoes bum
There they go, there they go, there they go

(Hold up) Slap niggas make the hoes go dumb
Gettin' hella change so we call each other bum (X2)

Verse 2

And crew can't make the hoes go dumb
My hood trend set where you think you get it from?
Let me pull down Scottwood? choppin' with the posse
Had to grab a OZ and a pint of Rossi

My hood could fly if you rockin' that shit that you would not see
Damn it so obvious when niggas try to copy
And my nigga pulled a bang right before the show
Everybody know ???? got the polos on the low

Let me hear my nigga luggage
And see where the tree be
Mary's got them free leaves
Boppin' on repeat
Grindin' my DC
Up under that BBC
Ain't no second guessin' when we step out ho
You see we be

Killin' and walkin' around
This shit you never seen
Even though I stay fly
Yo I'm never on the scene

Cuz really I'm just a low key
Nigga who smoke weed
And be so clean
Just like all of my homies

[Hook]
