Have us a good time, and I ain’t gonna lie
Got some friends around, nigga slide by,
Have us a good time and I ain’t gonna lie
Got some friends around me, got some friends around me
Have us a good time, and I ain’t gonna lie
Got some friends around, nigga slide by,
Have us a good time and I ain’t gonna lie
Got some friends around me, got some friends around me

My people be on across the globe
Don't box me in, claustrophobe
Tonight we alive, we should give em a show
And my living room dance floor is ready to go
My people be on across the globe
Don't box me in, claustrophobe
Tonight we alive, we should give em a show
And my living room dance floor is ready to go

(Bring your friends)
Ready to go
(Bring your friends)
Ready to go

[Bridge]
Bring your friends
