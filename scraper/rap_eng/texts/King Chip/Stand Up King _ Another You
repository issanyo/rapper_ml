[Verse 1]
This life that chose me filled with hate and some hoes and lots of dough
Yeah, my nigga, we sipping, grab that 2 liter, I got the 4
Please excuse my bluntness, oh, you don't smoke? Excuse my bluntness
No, don't try me cause you don't want this
Yeah, my Oldsmobile was stuntless
You a fake ass nigga, I'm a stand up king
Fall to your knees and kiss this ring
Y'all hoes ain't got shit on us
Nigga, we too real, no jewels, all bling
Couple stripes, sipping that, flipping in the clique
Real niggas put two guns in the air
Let it out, two or three shots to let these fuck niggas know
We up in here
Bitch ass nigga, I'm king, this bread fine, I'm spitting these facts
You can keep your two cents cause I'm working with all these racks
Bitch ass nigga, I'm King Chip, rhyme with a queen and two or three jacks
Yeah, y'all hoes can roll as long as y'all promise to relax
Can't fuck with hoes that's too turnt up, her image gotta be flawless
Every damn asshole, what they call us
That's probably cause they can't call us
Got no communication with these lames, just let 'em keep faking
Been too patient, one shot turn niggas to patients
Just face it

[Hook]
You a fake ass nigga, I'm a stand up king
Fall to your knees and kiss this ring
You a fake ass nigga, I'm a stand up king
Fall to your knees and kiss this ring
You a fake ass nigga, I'm a stand up king
Fall to your knees and kiss this ring
You a fake ass nigga, I'm a stand up king

[Verse 2]
Have a goddess in my hotel, last few nights I sweat for God
Sink, their life so crazy, so many times I almost died
Everybody wanna be a boss here, everybody wanna be head nigga in charge
Everybody wanna play killer but don't nobody wanna take that charge
You a fake ass nigga, I'm a stand up king
Fall to your knees and kiss this ring
Y'all hoes ain't got shit on us
Nigga, we too real, no jewels, all bling
Tell these hoes I got that glow, I'm a always make sure you know
Blow was out 10 years ago, selling reggie outside the store
Post it up, gotta miss the seeds, got niggas out here tryina get a little cheese
Police don't say freeze, they just squeeze, yo Kimble rest in peace
Bitch ass world tryina hold me back, a lot of my niggas never seen ten rack
Money only good when you able to spend it
New Benz only look good when I'm in it
Real shit, nigga got a brand new branding, when the new shit drop, I'm a be in it
Should've never told me time to get it, should've never told me sky's the limit
Level takes walking through the mall, bitches thought they seen a Sasquatch
Bitch, come get these back shots, might as well call 'em rack shots

[Hook]
