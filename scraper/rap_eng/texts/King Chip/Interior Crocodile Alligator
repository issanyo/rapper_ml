[Intro]
Yeah, Chip Tha Ripper
S-L-A-B, you already know who it is
Uhh, yeah, uhh, ayy

[Verse]
Now baby I'm the ripper, your baby daddy's worst nightmare
Catch me by the Clair, I'll be right there
Niggas copy everything we say
Louie frames, eyes lower than my G-P-A
Riding and swervin', kush I'm blowin'
Doors wide, my trunk bump like Eddy Road
I don't cake hoes, I never tip the stripper
I'm rich, bitch, but you can call me "Cheap tha Ripper"
Shell toes, yes. P.R.P.S
There's a man riding a horse on top of my chest
Polo fresh, I am ze man
I be slam dunking Tanqueray shots wit' LeBron
Told niggas keep it Carmelo, okay
Rolled past Dave told him "hello" and "hey"
Me and Cash in something old on 23's, ho
Back window says "Mama Mel Bicho"
Skateboarders grind, I grind too
That's why you can catch me in D.C. shoes
I quit the team but believe I'm ballin'
Want a verse, put up a stack or quit calling
30's on my Chevrolet call me super duper
Garage like Roots I got more whips than Kunta
Riviera sitting on the Bulls best hooper
Y'all still riding 20's, y'all some Oompa Loompas
Doors swang on niggas that got bad behavior
My four 15's woke up the neighbors
Interior crocodile alligator
I drive a Chevrolet movie theater
Ha, ha, ha
