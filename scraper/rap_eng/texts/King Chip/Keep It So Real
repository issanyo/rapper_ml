[Intro]

Yeah

Cardo on the beat

Niggas on now

[Verse 1: Chip Tha Ripper]

Me and my niggas is up in this thang
Best believe these nuts gonna hang
Take it to the left see the cold young thang
With the ass too fat and the pink tongue ring
Hoping that she know what to do
Gotta choose me cause a nigga won’t choose
And you see a nigga hard than you know I want you
Now we up in the mall, do you like those shoes?
What about that Louie, do you like that too?
With a bunch of friends invite them through
We can do everything that you might wanna do
Everything that you probably wanna do
Now we up in the crib with the lean and the weed
Everybody dtf indeed
Gotta be the fliest nigga that you ever seen
Promise I can give you everything that you need
But I won’t give you everything that you want
Wish you give me head while I'm blazin the blunt
You should let me hit it any way that you want
We up in the lex with the bang in the trunk
If a nigga run the bars then I’m blazing them up
Riding through the ghetto, lazy as fuck
Cause you can’t be spilling on loud with the cup
Everybody know nigga, I don’t give a fuck
Chevy in the park it's right with the ice if you suck this right then you might see me twice
She don't love me she love my life
She don't love me she love my life
Damn that was so cold nigga had to say it twice
'Scuse my fresh, be polite, do my best
Keep it so real don't like that shit
Keep it so real don't like that shit

[Hook]

Goddamn Ga-Goddamn
Keep It so real don't like that shit [x3]
Goddamn Goddamn my fam
Keep It so real don't like that shit [x3]
Goddamn Ga-Goddamn
Keep It so real don't like that shit [x3]
Goddamn Goddamn my fam
Keep It so real don't like that shit [x2]
Keep It so real
