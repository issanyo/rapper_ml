[Verse 1]
All hail King Chip, damn, where the fuck is King Chip?
Rockin' Yeezy 2's on rose petals, you believe this shit?
Nigga is way out in Spain, nigga is way out his lane
Puffin' Cubans on St. Claire, this nigga lost his brain
Bitch, I am King Chip, bitch, I'm gon' stay rich, bitch
No safety on my straps, seven [?] your shit, bitch
I'm really from that shit, niggas don't make it out my hood
So that makes me a Cleveland legend, get that understood

[Hook]
Know a Cleveland nigga smokin' under palm trees
Fuck up off my nuts let a dog breathe
Know a nigga smokin' under palm trees
Got some freaks up at my crib, they don't wan' leave
Know a Cleveland nigga smokin' under palm trees
Fuck up off my nuts let a dog breathe
Know a nigga smokin' under palm trees
Got some freaks up at my crib, they ain't tryna leave

[Verse 2]
I'm takin' over your brain, give me your watch, give me your chain
Got to live, gotta maintain, like that weed, gotta stay sane
Got my seed up out that rain, me and West swaggin' in Cali
This where all the haters wanna be, but they can't afford to get at me
Shit, nigga might as well live happy, might as well stay up on that fly shit
Got them red Balenciagas, come go shoppin' in my closet
Get your hand out my pocket, y'all ain't independent like me
Y'all ain't into winning like me, can't get in, you need your ID
Girl you're not on the list, please stand off to the side
We gon' let some hoes inside, what's up hoes, come on inside
You're my dog you know we gon' ride, we ain't lettin' that shit slide
Can't go out like no bitch, cause I got way too much pride

[Hook]
