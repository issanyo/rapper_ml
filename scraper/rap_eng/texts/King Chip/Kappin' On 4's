Slab up...
Chip the ripper

[Hook:]
We kappin(we kappin) on 4's (on 4's) [x4]

[Verse:]
I be swangin' n' be swervin'
My doors doing tricks
Ya already know what slab in dis bitch
I'm a stack chips, shit, that is my damn name
Pull up slow, pull out dough
You broke? that's a damn shame
I be kappin' on these hoes, got diamonds in my mouth
Kappin on mtv cribs, gotta baseball field in my damn house
I pull out my strap, leave these niggas assed out
Pulled out my dang-a-lang made your sister pass out
See me swervin' through your hood, I don't give a fuck
What time does the movie start? got 80 inch screen in my tahoe truck
I'm all about a buck?
Said that on my last tape
Gettin paid but I ain't change I'm still black and my ass stank
Ridin on 4 ferris wheels 28 inches hold up listen
Stop n scoop up hoes
When they get in I charge admission
Check my 77 cutty
Screens fallin', paint drippin'
My inside big enough to have a livin' room n kitchen
I pull up swang, now old folks complain
Cause my trunk got enough bang to make they oxygen tanks drain
Chip that's my name
Doors I'm a swang em
Niggas be hatin', I ain't gonna shoot, I'm a get some barb wire n hang em
4 15's in the back of my 87 grand prix
Screens on glow when I pull up slow these niggas can't stand me
Let my trunk bang
Drop top cutty ain't got no lid
Roll through the park, swung on all the kids
Hold up, hold up, stop the beat
Let me sip my drank
Wen I run outta goose I'm a get out my car & lick my paint
Doors do the fool
My rims stop n' go
Call up some gold digga' hoes wen they get 2 my house I'm a lock my door, BITCH!
Yes I'm from the slab
Yes I get that cash
No I'm not in love with a stipper show me them breasts & bounce that ass HOE!
Kappin' is a habit I'm not tryna break ho
Let my screens fall on Ray Park and they saw 'em on Lake Shore
Bitch I stay throwed
Bitch I make dough
I don't spit no god damn game, Hoes fuck when I say so
What u mean fuck a hater... I want u 2 hate me
Cause as long as I got haters I know I that I make cheese
