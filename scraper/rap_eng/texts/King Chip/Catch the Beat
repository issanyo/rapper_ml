[Verse 1]
Okay good evening everyone and welcome to the track
That you probably downloaded from your PC or your Mac
Yes, I'm the main topic in the barbershop chat
Now you can call me Chip, or you can call me crack
I'm in a comfy condo with every one of your ladies
Now say hi girls...
Ssh, okay how about some silence?
Let's see if I can focus while these girlies tickle my privates
Yes, baby I'm the Ripper
Baby, I'm a winner
Thick girl's a freak but she say she's a beginner
I'll put you on a diet if you're trying to get thinner:
Babies for breakfast, babies for dinner
I grip the damn grain 'til my hands get splinters
I control the ball before the snap just like a center
But this ain't football
Cuz if it was then your bitch would be the wide receiver crawling on the rug
And I would be the quarterback telling her to go long
And she would catch the touchdown pass above her thong
Something must be wrong
What is going on?
Everybody's T-shirts are still too damn long
Yeah, that was cool a couple years ago but now it's different
I don't pay for the jeans, I just pay true religion
And of course the man on my shirt's riding a horse
And I wear so much DC they should endorse
Live life denim
I live life in 'em
Wear so much Live Mechanic people ask did I invent 'em
People tend to forget where I'm from here and there
'Cuz I'm on Saks Fifth Avenue more than I'm on Da Clair
And if you owe me a dollar you on Death Row
That .45 hurt to swallow like strep throat
Fuck a lady, get the money, sip the liquor
These bitches ain't shit, mother nature was a stripper

[Hook 4x]
Now watch me catch the beat
Catch the beat
Catch the beat
Catch the beat

[Verse 2]
Pimp, I get my limp on
What the hell is Chip on?
In a five fifth the same color as my skin tone
Big balls, dick long
Pants was a thousand
P.R.P.S baby girl, I be stylin'
That nigga be wildin'
Trend setter, ho
That means if you got it on then I don't
That means if you doing that, the I don't
If you niggas is buying out the bar then I won't
I'll just take them hoes that you had to my crib
Give them Tanqueray to sip
Then sit back and watch them strip
Then sit back and get my dick sucked
(Get my, get my dick sucked)
Hoes will do anything for a nigga with big bucks
And we got them big bucks, that's a no brainer
My CuDi got the top dropped I'm driving a no brainer
Then I upgrade, we don't test drive it
I'm in the sky cracking jokes with the pilot
I'm on the DoLo
Catch me in that polo
You fuck with my money, I'm in your ass (No homo)
I'll be in the fo' do'
Counting that fa'sho dough
I don't do promo, cuz promo means no dough
Hop on the train, let's get wicked
I'm the train conductor, I hope you have a ticket
Girls want to kick it, but I just want to stick it
I should put a counter on my balls like Skip-It
I got a Ruger and I'm not afraid to shoot it
(What the fuck is that smell?)
Oh yeah, I pooted
My stomach is bubbling
I have to take a shit, umm
Where's the nearest toilet or corny rapper to shit on?
Get money, get goin'
Used to get picked on
Now all the hoes watch me just like a sitcom
SLAB in this bitch don't get punched and kicked on
Nobody is on the level that Chip's on
