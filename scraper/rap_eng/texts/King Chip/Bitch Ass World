[Verse 1]
Yeah, my nigga's own father shot him in
The stomach like four times
He took a step back, look his pop
In the eyes and he survived
Nigga that shit so crazy
Dog on life I hit survive
Nigga that shit so crazy
Nigga on life I swear for God
What could make a nigga try to murk his own son?
I know I'd die for mine
Your parent got a divorce
Nigga shot your bitch ass and quit crying
My nigga be strong, nigga hold your own
Nigga this world ain't no ho
So many people I really love, they ain't alive no more
My day my niggas don't fuck with me no more
Because they broke
Like 21 years right down the drain my hearts are called no joke
Nigga that shit so crazy
Nigga on life I swear for God
My nigga got shot on that front lawn
That's where he died

[Hook 1]
Bitch ass world tryna hold me back
Bitch, bitch ass world
Bitch ass world tryna hold me back
Bitch, bitch ass world
Bitch ass world tryna hold me back
Bitch ass world tryna hold me back
Bitch ass world tryna hold me back
Bitch, bitch ass world
Bitch ass world tryna hold me back
Bitch, bitch ass world
Bitch ass world tryna hold me back
Bitch, bitch ass world
Bitch ass world tryna hold me back

[Verse 2]
Nigga in this wise they gettin' dick come take a flick
With a nigga who'd get all his shit and call him Chip
Up the text soon as they call the shit they call it quits
Shot the band and shot the audience I'll applaud him bitch
Clapping at him, I don't care if it's not fair
I don't care if they pussy don't even got hair
Till my gunners don't let him live
Till my gunners go up to the suburb where they mama live and pop the crib
Bitch I'm from the 44108 murder zone
Be Cali getting crown like I never heard of dome
I am king look what I came I own my own name
I ain't trade it for fame I am the same

[Hook 2]
Walkin though the crib with a chopper like Malcolm X
Walkin though the crib with a chopper
Walkin though the crib
Walkin though the crib with a chopper like Malcolm X
Walkin though the crib with a chopper
Walkin though the crib
Walkin though the crib with a chopper like Malcolm X
Walkin though the crib with a chopper
Walkin though the crib
Walkin though the crib with a chopper like Malcolm X
Walkin though the crib with a chopper like Malcolm X

[Verse 2]
Got that MAC nasty and the [?]
Ready to shoot it out with the hook if they raid the crib
So if I open all you this ain't no laser tag
The fuck is you gonna do if that gonna make me mad
You can buy school but can't pay for class
I say bullshit long as you're paying cash
You too can get an 8mm
.22 and my tempo's playing
Pencil brakes with .38's graduated to a Ber'
Staring through the drapes peaking though the blinds
With this AK-47 4-5
TEC-9 and the .40 that'll blow your mind

[Hook 2]

[Verse 3]
Yeah blood thicker than water, but money thicker than blood
But that's the one I spent on rodeo you can get dub
I'm in the coupe with something cute gettin' this loot
Racks in my pants, racks in my hands, racks in my boots
Got your advance except I don't owe it back like you
All of this mine watch me go ham I could buy you
True, my entertainment sell appliances
If King Chip ain't on your stereo, then why you buy the shit
Hit the club with a hundred killas like an Afghan
Hit the club in all black looking like Batman
King Chip is too heinous you ignoramus
Can nappytab my name on your face
Know what my name is

[Hook 2]
