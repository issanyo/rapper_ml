[Hook] 2x
Girl got a fat ol' ass
Yeah, ol' Girl got a fat ol' ass
Yeah, ol' Girl got a fat ol' ass
Yeah, that type that make you tell a bitch just dance

[Verse 1:]

Dance, too much booty in the pants
Caught eye contact like she knew me in the past
Ass so fat just dropped my glass
Ass so fat nigga couldn't write a pass
Latina mami super thick got not tats
Told her when she go Black won't go back
Baby girl have fun, don't hold back
Cause when you get old that booty might go flat
Educated paid nigga and from the hood
She need a real nigga that can do something to it
Naw, she just want a nigga that stunt good
She got back but I wonder if the front good
We at the pool party, she got bikini on
Shut the whole party down had to bring her home
She choosing she on me like a tattoo
And all her homegirls got ass too

Repeat Hook

Let me see you drop it
Let me see you drop it
Now bring it up, what
Now bring it up, what
Bounce to the floor, what
To the floor, what
Let me see you drop that
Yeah, don't stop

[Verse 2]

From the neck up is amazing
From the neck down, eyebrow raisin'
She killin' all the girls on World Star
She wanna be on TV, be a world star
She in VIP gettin' it
You can hear the ass clap when she hittin' it
How you shaped like that, I'm not gettin' it
I'm in the zone thinkin' bout hittin' it
That ass took over the whole club
Somebody hold my drink I'm in love
I just wanna walk up to and give it a hug
You might as well come sock it to the plug
Fuck the bullshit, I'm tryna get inside her
Them high heels make that ass sit a little higher
Man it's too light in this club, let's get ? here
And when she walk there's booty everywhere

Repeat Hook

Let me see you drop it
Let me see you drop it
Now bring it up, what
Now bring it up, what
Bounce to the floor, what
To the floor, what
Let me see you drop that
Yeah, don't stop
