[Chip The Ripper]
Uh get it girl put it in my...
Uh get it girl put it I'm my...
Uh get it girl put it in my...
Uh get it girl put it in my...

[Verse 1: Chip The Ripper]
Baby I'm the ripper
See me on them 4's
T.V.'s I suppose
Lookin' for these hoes
Bitches know the deal
When they see me swing them doors
Tell em they ain't even got to take off no clothes

When you see me in that old school swerving
Probably cause your baby mama in my lap slurping
Hit the freeway goin 77 south
Thick light skinned dime setting off the mouth
Take your time speed it up really don't matter at all
Long as the baby batter splatter in ya jaw
Let it shoot from the window to the wall
My knees week I try to stand up and I fall
Now it's my niggas turn he got next
Don't expect a dollar we ain't writting no checks
I don't wanna feel your teeth this ain't the chewing
Two niggas and one girl what was ya'll doing

[Hook: Chip The Ripper]
She's a go liver
Put it I'm my
She's a go liver
Put it in my
She's a go liver
Put it in my
She's a go liver
Put it in my get it girl

[Verse 2: Chip The Ripper]
Ay little mama got a ass so fat my nigga
Like damn look at that look at that
Yea I said it's cool
But I don't even wanna stroke her
Cause when she lick my nuts it's like I'm on a rollar coater
Dear Mrs. thick lips
I'm the big blow the juices of the tip
If you give it a good lick
I know you don't want nobody thinking your a trick
But the windows on the cutty tinted I ain't sayin shit
Me you and my crew can go somewhere private
So you can salive it but you ain't gotta hide it
The whole hood know that you a go liver
So go head and dive in my thighs like Godiva
Gave shawty a ride but she ain't have no gas money
She said "Chip I'm broke but you can get some ass from me"
"I gotta better idea"
I said, as I reclined my seat
I had her quick weave bouncin to the beat like

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Fat Al]
Ay girl I'm swang nine and I ain't talkin about a nine
But my dick is brain food good for your mind
Oh you smoke that's fine
At least I know now she goin down down down for a dime
How rude of me it's the f-a-t
Pull up on three's candy green armani seats
But that's only half you ain't seen shit yet
Pull up fresh checks off the marquee jets
Plus I gotta about a pound of diamonds on my neck
Pull up in a lex
My pockets to cash a check
Don't mind me cappins a natural reflex
You won't reject
Cause I'm me and that's that
I ain't askin for much just a little jaw
Not trying to hit your walls
Just wanna hear you gaw
You make it hard for me to control myself
Just thinking about your barin makes me Oh myself
She be like

[Hook]

[Hook: Chip The Ripper]
She's a go liver
Put it I'm my
She's a go liver
Put it in my
She's a go liver
Put it in my
She's a go liver
Put it in my get it girl

Put it in my get it girl
