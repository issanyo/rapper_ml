[Hook x2]
Mr. Officer, get your bitch ass in the truck
(Yea, I got the police in the trunk)
Mr. Officer, get your bitch ass in the truck
(Bitch ass nigga what's up I got the police in the trunk)

[Verse 1]
Riding through EC I got my pistol and my blunt
Peach and white impala sittin' up [?]
I got pulled over, deep off in the cut
When he came up to the window yea he met my sawed off pump
Bitch ass nigga what's up? You make one move you gonna get killed
Bitch ass nigga what's up? Take off that radio and belt
He try to pull a superhero move and grab my shotty
I just took a step back and blew his melon off his body
Damn there's so much blood and brains I ain't get none on me
Had a blanket in the trunk I wrapped him up and hit the street
Set the police car on fire 'fore I left so yea, I'm good
Feelin' tell my nigga [?] come up to the hood

[Hook x2]

[Verse 2]
I'm riding with this headless deputy I got a plan
Got to drive this headless deputy like halfway 'cross the land
So I'm flying up 'bout 90 bumping Project Pat I'm cool
I got off on Eddie Rd. I knew exactly what to do
My nigga father own a butcher shop right [?]
Bout to turn this nigga to ground beef as soon as I get there
Let my nigga know the scoop I told him raise up the garage
Told him climb up off them bitches he was having a menage
Less than 20 minutes I got to the shop and popped the trunk
Cop shitted on himself you should have smelt the way he stunk
Gave my nigga like four rags and told him take care of this here
Was the same cop that killed two of my niggas late last year
