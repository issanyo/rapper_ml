[Verse 1: King Chip]
If my niggas don't fuck wit' you, I don't fuck wit' you
That's just a code in my hood, don't let these guns hit you
Be a man of your word, don't ever let 'em play you
Stand up for your shit, make sure these haters pay you
Can't nothing stop a room full of real niggas
I got some bad rich bitches, they my real niggas
It's like working four jobs not to kill niggas
My little niggas love to ride by and spill niggas
If y'all fell out over some chips that ain't your real nigga
If y'all fell out over a chick that ain't your real nigga
Before I be a house nigga be a field nigga
I gotta Port Arthur chick, call it my trill nigga
I met Duke in 92 and we still niggas
Rockin Hilfigers before they was like chill niggas
Living well me and my niggas go'n eat
Before you hate, hit the brakes with both feet

[Hook: Kid Cudi]
Hey yo, all right
This is how it's supposed to be (x4)
Hey yo, all right

[Verse 2: Rolla Costa]
If my brothers don't fuck with you ima fuck with you
Egg your fucking whip right in front of your bad bitch
Didn't care if my swag was weird they staired
Like 50 flights so they couldn't keep up with my fly
But it's like when they see me with a new joint they wanna cyph
But I'm laughing like ain't this nigga said I can't ride a bike
Started rocking these jerseys and it trended to my brothers
Like Ben got my brother franklin working started from a boss at young
But rally just chillin having fun
So when you see me just know I'm
Working
Trying to start a business
Ah tv show a clothing line
My nigga we be hoping the train back to the block
We saved guap for lil cezar pizza box (Ahhh) real nigga shit right there
For now crunch time is lunch time and one rhyme is dumb fine

[Hook: Kid Cudi]
Hey yo, all right
This is how it's supposed to be (x4)
Hey yo, all right

[Verse 2: A$AP Rocky]
Max with the homies, try to teach them things
Teach them how to make a piece of change, even keep the change
But they neva change, bought a set of chains with another chain
Upgraded to a better chain, that Beretta sing, I ain't playing
Shoes on the 'rari start to look like hooves
Pigs by the crib start to look like wolves
Money neva change me only change the situation
The paper I be chasin got them sucka niggas hatin
Started from the pavement, basement Satan
Couldn't match my flames so they compare me to a mason
Free like slaves but they based and crazy
We talkin' bout crack or we talkin about blacks?
Spliffing the blunt up, then they pickin the gun up
Motherfuckers is trippin, they fixin' to run up
Then they gettin the come up, yup bitch
And they do it 'til the sun up
And this is for my niggas and my gang
Through the fortune and the fame
Only thing that never change is my niggas

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Kid Cudi]
I got the niggas that I need with me
Any issues my nigga you know to please hit me
No question no hesitation when it comes to holding fam down
If you creep me the fuck out you probably ain't around
Now you can hate on the side lines, I'm skippin past
You got me fucked up, keep talkin and kiss my ass
No sweatin the ho shit, too in tune with the family
I do got the ones that do know Scott
They give me the love that a nigga need
If its a place to stay or a dime sack of weed
Word to Dennis, ridin' thick and thin until we finished
Focused to keep the pockets replenished, clothes on our kids
And keep my niggas from goin away on a bid
Only wanted all the fly shit when we got big
Chasin these hoes up in they ribs at they momma crib
Beat niggas up so 'bout it, 'bout it they go blind about it
We all grown, families of our own
Providing for 'em real niggas, real morals that's the code
Perform so long as I am my brother's keeper
He will provide me with a nine if I need or a street sweeper
The love I have for my niggas is another type
You gotta real nigga down with you for your whole life
Love for my niggas
The brothers that I never had made my life a lot less sad my nigga

[Hook]
