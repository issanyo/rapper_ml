[Verse 1]
Ask a brand new baby bout me
Yea, ask your old lady bout me
Some girls say they can’t live without me
Broke hoes tryin to get babies out me
Nigga pulled up so extra clean
Swing my door, you smell that green
Bad ass bitch long hair don’t care
Look like she model for Maybelline
Chip go shopping every day
I just grab whatever I want
Make sure I take care of my shit
Young Cash [be?] number one
Boo, as soon as I picked you up
You should've gave me head in the car
You should fuck me now girl
Don’t wait til I’m a megastar
Riding through my crazy hood
Where you're not allowed to be
Pulled up on my nigga Mase
He said he was proud of me
If I ever caught that bitch nigga who murked Hawk
Sawed off shotty to the dome without no talk
My nigga ain’t make the news ’cause he was in the streets
Now the word is they don't give a fuck bout young black niggas like me
But fuck the world I’m swingin' to pay the ?
Sippin this purple, smoking tree with my companion
Yeah, we jammin damn it

[Hook]
A-A-A-A-Ask-ask
Ask a brandy new baby bout me
Ask-a-ask-ask a brand new baby bout me
Ask-a-ask-ask a brand new baby bout me
You can ask your baby
Ask-a-ask-ask a brand new baby bout me
You can ask your baby bout me
Ask a brand new baby bout me
You can ask your baby bout me
A-A-A-A-Ask-ask
Ask a brand new baby bout me
You can ask your baby bout me
You can ask your lady bout me

[Verse 2]
Ask a brand new baby bout me
You can ask your old lady bout me
Some girls say they can’t live without me
Broke hoes tryin to get babies out me
King Chip extra cold
Young boss extra bold
Nigga just really don’t give no fuck
Money is cool but I’d rather have gold
I’m bendin corners through my hood
What's up 117th
Flying down 105, Lakeview, where them killers be
? Road niggs don’t give no fuck
Shout out to the Sterns
Parked in front of that red wine house
With little C and that blunt gon burn
Free my nigga Monkey Dame
Free my nigga ?
I was right there when the judge gave my Lil State bout 38 years
Then victim’s wife took the stand and explained
How she found the her husband dead and I was like damn
They said my nigga pistol whipped him after he shot him
Some ho ass nigga took the stand and testified with no problem
Years later I’m living in Malibu Canyons
Sipping this purple, smokin tree with my companion
Yeah we jammin dammit
