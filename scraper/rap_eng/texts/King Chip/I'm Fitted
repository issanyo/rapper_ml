[Intro]
Uh, Yeah

[Hook]x2
I'm fitted, I'm fitted, I'm fitted, I'm fitted
(Fresh)

[Verse 1]
I done swong out imma swang
Slab ain't no gang
But Everybody Know my name
Diamonds on my piece and chain
(uh)
Had the game locked up from Cleveland to Lorain
Money got that bitch sewed up from L.A. to Maine
Paint drip off the frameI got money in my pocket
The bank called and asked when you gone make a deposit
You think I'm fresh to death now you should see my closet
You see my house you'll say i lost it got Moet coming out the faucet
Everything's real fake clothes that's a no-no
When i hit the mall hoes run up taking photos
Used to be bonk i was broke i was dolo
In a chevy swimming pool with Marco and Polo
Evisus for promo, nigga this how we do
Red Monkey Bathing Apes somebody call the damn zoo
God bless me i didn't have to achoo
I'm gone blow i got dough nigga how about you
I step out (i'm fitted)
Ain't no doubt (i'm fitted)
Check my fit (i'm fitted)
Polo tee (i'm fitted)
Look at my jeans (i'm fitted)
Goddammit I'm clean (i'm fitted)
Where in the world did he get it (i'm fitted)
Just admit it (i'm fitted)

[Hook]

I'm a fly young nigga (ugh) don't you forget it
Put some money on a mountain top I'mma go get it
In the summer kept the plumber, everytime I stepped out I shitted
24s on the truck, I did it
When I hopped out Im fitted
In my ROC fit, I get cash I'm the man hoe!
LRG, BBC, my outfit costs a grand ho
Visu jeans, white tee, I'm gon' do some damage
Don't ask for an oil change if you see me in Live Mechanics
No need for dairy queen i am desert
In my ice cream shoes and my ice cream shirt
PRPS fresh spend about a nine
Skateboard DC's I'm on my grind
200 for the lokes, yes
I'm so fresh
I got hoes? yes
I blow the best
Trendsetter when I step out
I make sure nobody did it
I'm fitted

I step out, (i'm fitted)
Ain't no doubt, (i'm fitted)
Check my feet (i'm fitted)
Polo tee (i'm fitted)
Look at my jeans (i'm fitted)
God damnit I'm clean (i'm fitted)
Well, where'd he get it?? (i'm fitted)
Just admit it! (i'm fitted)
Im fitted (i'm fitted)
