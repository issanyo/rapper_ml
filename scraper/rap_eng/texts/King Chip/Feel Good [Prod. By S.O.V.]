Chip Tha Rip
Mmhmm

Bitch I feel good
Don't I look stupendous?
My shine is so endless
Ain't shit you can do to end this
Even when I'm dead nigga's still gon' bump that Chip shit
Coke white escalade on 6's for you dipshits
So you won't forget this, midwest nigga be the coldest
Cleveland is the city where you hustle or you hopeless
And my closet's like a store bitch
Only difference is you ain't gon' find this in no store bitch
It's fresher than your whole clique
G shock over D.C. grindin' everytime you see me
Hum louis Vuitton complete me
Now r.i.p. to ant while I'm out here stuntin with keke
I be ridin' super tint
I'm a ghost you never see me
Cause I'm up above, I'm in the clouds, I'm rollin up, I'm lookin down
Chip in the house, ya'll stop ya breathin
I'm a superhero, like hancock to cleveland (nigga)

Hell yea, that nigguh shine all the time but look at him you can tell he from the hood
Bitch, I feel good
Hold up, roll up, we just smoked 4 blunts and I'm feelin like I should
Bitch, I feel good
Nigga where the liquor? Where the cups? Where the ladies, where the sluts? I'm drunk, what
Bitch, I feel good
And I'ma stay a fresh, fly nigguh doin' everything you would if you could
Bitch, I feel good

Don't I look tremdous?
Damn I feel so splendid
I walk up in yo shindig
Higher than the o-zone, damn I can float home
Just call me when you want some
I'm out here by my lonesome
Pack a bape jacket for the winter polo v-neck for the summer
I'm a young hood boss, I do what I wanna
If you tryna fuck with me then you better have some bros hun
I fuck wit them OG's, I'm probably stuntin with yo fathaaa
Problem is you don't want it, nada
My nigguh's got hella choppas, you gonna need hella doctaaas
And I rep my city proper
Probably catch me rockin' prada, hoppin off a helicoptaaa
In the skizigh, CuDi hand me ya shizit
Nigga we gettin hizigh
Uh, lookin for izigh, yeah here I go
The nigga who get your income tax every show (lets go)

Hell yea, that nigguh shine all the time but look at him you can tell he from the hood
Bitch, I feel good
Hold up, roll up, we just smoked 4 blunts and I'm feelin like I should
Bitch, I feel good
Nigga where the liquor? Where the cups? Where the ladies, where the sluts? I'm drunk, what
Bitch, I feel good
And I'ma stay a fresh, fly nigguh doin' everything you would if you could
Bitch, I feel good
