They come around, but they never come close to

[Verse 1: King Chip]
He came on the scene at seventeen
He just wanted to show what they never seen
He never had no goals, he never dreamed
He just wanted niggas in his hood to swing
And sure enough, them old schools spread they wings
In big trucks that's rimmed up
Man each door got fifteen
They all screamed for Chip to do his thing
He stay true to his hood
'Cause he believe he a young prince
And every O.G. is a king, or a general
And he's just a private saluting
Atten-hut, now man up and do things
Leave a mark in this world, pursue dreams
And chase paper till you can't walk
Or when your legs go out
Just get more dough, just like hawk
Aw, shit, would you listen at him talk?
You thought you was on fire
Bitch, you never had a spark
They what?
