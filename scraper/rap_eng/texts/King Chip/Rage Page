[Verse 1: David Biga]
The inner fill with rage
Hit the page
Then the page hit face
Baby learn the name
The flow
Leave it rearranged
Introduced to pain
Looking down to aim
The kids got range
Whip bang
God damn
What you really trying to say
Wait here
Whoa lord
Oh Nelly
When she comes around
She begs to be bellied
When you’re this smooth
Each step is like a wheelie
They all blame me cause
I make their girl get silly
Switch and sue me
Bobby Boucher
Except with kool-aid
Who they?
Who cares cause they flakes
Who me?
So baked
Frito Lay
Today
Is good day
Welcome to the boss round
Come n bounce now
It’s bound to go down
Hit towns
Downtown
What now
Switch sounds
Leave it all up in the air
All this work means
No complaints over here
It must be hard to bare

[Bridge: David Biga]
Sit there and stare
The rage fill air
Aye
Whatchu need?
Aye there's a fee
Aye I am me
Aye I am free
Rage I am free
Rage I am free

[Chorus: David Biga]
I have so much rage
It fills my soul
When I speak these words
My soul just lets it go


[Verse 2: Chip Tha Ripper (King Chip)]
Went Whippin
Tinted tripping
Smoking
I’m focused
You popping?
I ain't noticed
I seen a lot of bogus
Can’t fit in my partner lotus
I'm driving like I'm angry
Niggas better not try n play me
Valet my Mercedes
Hop with some project babies
Valet my Mercedes
Hop out and you gots to pay me
Shopping
Big popping
My niggas ain't never stopped rapping
Found out that I was top rhyming
Now these hoes don’t ever stop slobbing
Foreign
Touring
Hope these hoes ain't boring
Hope they know I'm scoring
Hope they know I'm scoring
Come to my section
Kept it flexing
Got that rose pouring
Come to my section got Patron
I got some Jose for em
Making statements on em
Bank statements on em
Pull up skating on em
Damn no wonder they hating on me
Don’t like me
I love it
Take your life and shove it
Ima try to be nice in public
Even though I came from a life of thuggin

[Bridge: David Biga]
Sit there and stare
The rage fill air
Aye
Whatchu need?
Aye there's a fee
Aye I am me
Aye I am free
Rage I am free
Rage I am free

[Chorus: David Biga]
I have so much rage
It fills my soul
When I speak these words
My soul just lets it go

[Verse 3: David Biga]
And then I go

That’s soul
What cha know?
Let’s go

We here to die
We’ll give our life
To Give it to your mind
We Savage
Outlandish
Eat ya face off
With good manners
Filleted like salmon
So sick call it famine
Get handled
Rocky meets Rambo
Bent to limbo
Turn a play to a digit
It’s really that simple
Girls wanna pole volt

Make em all drip sauce
Keep it in a slip lock
Flip it like Rick Ross
Get in it headlock
