[Intro]

[Verse 1]
You do not need to do all that
You need to calm your ass down
You need to hit this killer weed
And not make a sound
You need to bring it from a level ten
To a level two or three
You need to stop tryin' to hit a three
Play some fuckin' D
You need to get your shit together
Nigga, your attitude is weak
You need to stop actin' like somebody owe you somethin'
And go beat up the street
You need to stop beggin' me for money
You ain't gettin' none from me
Without joinin' military
You need to be all that you can be
Nigga, you need stop tryin' to intervene
Tryin' to get some green
Try to get an operation goin'
Try to build a team
You need to come with somethin' brand new
Shit we've never seen
Nigga, we a Type Zero civilization
You lookin' at me like, 'fuck does that mean?'

[Chorus]
You do not need to do all that
You need to calm your ass down
You need to hit this killer weed
And not make a sound
You need to focus on you
Shut the fuck up and sit your ass down
You need to hit this killer weed
And sit your ass down

[Chorus]
You do not need to do all that
You need to calm your ass down
You need to hit this killer weed
And not make a sound
You need to focus on you
Shut the fuck up and sit your ass down
You need to focus on you
Shut the fuck up and sit your ass down

[Verse 2]
You do not need to do all that
You need to calm your ass down
You wanna talk crazy when I'm gone?
You ain't cop deuce when I'm in town
You need a blunt and bottled water
You'd rather have molly and some brown
You need a blunt and a bottled water
And you need to sit your ass down
You always on the scene
Ain't never got no green
I tried to tell these stupid niggas
But they ain't listen to the King
Get the fuck off planet Earth
You ain't tryin' to do the right thing
We a Type Zero civilization
You lookin' at me like, 'fuck does that mean?'
Because of fuck niggas like you
This planet is disintegratin'
You just sittin' there waitin'
You just in the way and you just sittin' there hatin'
Must be your bitch that I'm penetratin'
Must be the way I finesse a payment
Finally somebody made these statements
Walked out the bank and I made a statement
Stupid, that's not how you make a statement

[Chorus]
You do not need to do all that
You need to calm your ass down
You need to hit this killer weed
And not make a sound
You need to focus on you
Shut the fuck up and sit your ass down
You need to hit this killer weed
And sit your ass down

[Chorus]
You do not need to do all that
You need to calm your ass down
You need to hit this killer weed
And not make a sound
You need to focus on you
Shut the fuck up and sit your ass down
You need to focus on you
Shut the fuck up and sit your ass down

[Outro]
