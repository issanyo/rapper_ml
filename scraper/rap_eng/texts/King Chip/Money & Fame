[Intro: King Chip]
Yeah, King Chip
Money and fame...
Money and fame...

[Verse 1: King Chip]
You talking bout how much money you got
Your niggas is broke
All turned up for the camera
Damn bruh its gotta be the coke
Money and fame got you feeling like God right now
Your day 1 nigga just called and you was like
Naw nigga not right now
You feeling that power
You were looking in the mirror for an hour
Nigga yous a coward
You scared you will lose that power
The story they tell bout you
To your kids is something you just can't buy
If you feel like money is the only reason you alive
Shit nigga might as well die
I give you about 58 dollars
To blast yourself in the head right now
That's about all its worth to watch your body
Go plop to the ground
You done lied to the world
Like you and your homeboys living on top
You done bought a new whip
And your nigga fucked up out looking for a job

[Hook: King Chip]
Money and fame, still won't change who been a bitch
Money and fame, can't change ya from being a bitch
Can't buy real cause it ain't for sale
Shits not for sale
Can't buy real cause it ain't for sale
Shits not for sale
Money and fame, won't change you from being a bitch
Money and fame, still can't change who been a bitch
Can't buy real cause it ain't for sale
Shits not for sale
Bitch nigga can't buy real
Cause it ain't for sale

[Verse 2: King Chip]
I rebuke you faking ass hoes
In the name of the Lord
You ain't never been with a real nigga
Just a bunch of fake niggas
And you lame and I'm bored
Real king with the glow
In the ghetto with the four
If you ever see a demon finna go
Yeah I got my foot up in the door
I ain't never been a ho
Now I'm 'bout to get my niggas in this ho
I done came back from the dead like a mummy
And my son let me in, gotta love me
Now you on this rap songs talking about money
But the niggas you came up with looking bummy
Fuck money, we'll take your money
Use that money to make more money
Your security guard's face so bloody
We done damn near [?], buddy
Niggas trying to sign me and shun me
Fuck your money
Get the fuck from me
Nigga trill, said Bun B
Nah a bitch can't run me
Bitch can't pimp me
Whoever said everything for sale
Is a god damned liar
You can ask Bun B, my nigga
That trill is just something you can't buy
