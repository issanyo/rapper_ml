[Intro: King Chip]
Yep
Chip
Nigga

[Verse 1: King Chip]
I can remember living in cars
Fuck the world, living is hard
Making mistakes and fixing them up
Either that or not giving a fuck
Because problems show up as much as the girls
Knock on the door, into my world
Hope you brought some weed my nigga
Break it on down, here goes the zig
Baby say we can tear up this hotel
As long as I promise to her I won't tell
Cause she be on tv reportin’ the news
Never thought I’d get a load of those boobs
Sometimes you win, sometimes you lose
Unless you play no games and say fuck the rules
And do what you want
Say what you feel
I am no asshole, I am just real
Being polite that's just being fake
Hard on myself but that's bein’ great
Ninety-nine times out of ten I be late
But when I show up, set up the wake
Killed their ass, roll up more grass
Pour some more Rémy up off in this glass
You having some fun, or having a blast?
Settle for less, nah I’ll pass

[Hook x2]
Imma do what the fuck I want to
And Imma buy what the fuck I want to
Roll up and tell them girls to come through
Only if we can do whatever I want to

[Verse 2: King Chip]
I can remember living outside
Ain't have no food, but still had my pride
Now in a four bedroom house I reside
Mercedes and Lexus that's what I ride
Came a good way from throwing hair dry
Most of my niggas no longer alive
Walk in the mall, they looking suprised
We going to be swagging the rest of our lives
Can't believe they had the indignation
To say I ain't repping
Bitch I paid the way for your soft ass, I'm Cleveland legend
I worry about death when it comes
Right now I'm [?]
Bitch I'm from Cleveland, yeah nigga that's my creation
Been running my town I'm not tired
Fuck with King Chip get a Lahar
We can burn these haters in a bonfire
Bitch I've been around since LimeWire
Shoutout to the [?]
Can't forget about my niggas on Superior
Riding down St: Clair in a white thing
Two hoes in my interior

[Hook x4]
Imma do what the fuck I want to
And Imma buy what the fuck I want to
Roll up and tell them girls to come through
Only if we can do whatever I want to
