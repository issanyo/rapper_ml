[Intro]
Stay without me
Stay without me
When your head goes down
When your head goes down
When your head goes down

[Verse 1: Lorine Chia]
I think they crazy, I think they really try to play me
Their whole approach was just to faze me
Their action plan is just to change me
You won't change me
I'm seeing everything for what it is and what it's 'possed to be
I pray the Lord is watching over me
This crazy world just took a toll on me
Won't take control of me, no longer be afraid
I'm hip to all their plans and mental games
Wisdom is gone and they call it change
Old friends are acting like we're not the same

[Hook]
Stay without me
Stay without me
When your head goes down
When your head goes down
When your head goes down
When your head goes down
Stay without me
Stay without me
When your head goes down
When your head goes down

[Verse 2: King Chip]
This bitch-ass world keep lying to me
A nigga was blind but now I see
My heart is pure but now I know
The world around me is way too low
Maybe that's why a nigga so high
Plant seeds so a nigga won't die
Get sent to jail, pay rent on time
Get sent to hell, nigga still gonna shine
My legacy is way beyond
My vital signs, I am a God
I can't describe first time I figured that the Bible lie
That's why I trust no organism
King Chip fear none now
Middle take I sent to his daughter again
Goddamn, it's going down
What you gonna do when camouflages banging on the door where you lay?
Tell the cops you got sent to watch
Can't postpone this here and you can't dodge
They gave our leaders cancer, Anne Russo, RIP
Newton William Cooper, damn, feel like he wrote that book for me
King Chip
