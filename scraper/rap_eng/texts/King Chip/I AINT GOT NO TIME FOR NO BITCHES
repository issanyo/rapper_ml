[Bridge]
I got no space up in my mind for these bitches
I was wasting all my time with these bitches
Spending money spending time with these bitches
Got no time for the bitches
I ain't got no times for no bitches
I got no space up in my mind for these bitches
I was wasting all my time with these bitches
Spending money spending time with these bitches
Got no time for the bitches
I ain't got no times for no bitches

[Verse 1]
And I really don’t really know
I do my thing give a fuck about these hoes you know
Bitch how the fuck you gon' be so ungrateful
How you gon' be so disrespectful to me when we talking on the phone
How the fuck you gon be so ungrateful
How the fuck you gon be disrespectful
Bitch I bought you everything you own
I can’t believe you turned on me
I can’t believe you brought some niggas to my home
Sat there watched me almost catch a case
Against a nigga plead the fifth
I won't be trusting these hoes no no
Had a nigga tell me that my son was lying when he told me that he saw his mommy kiss a man that wasn’t me
These hoes tryna' bring a nigga down tryna' kill me
I won't let these hoes kill me
Bitches could slow a nigga down if you let them
I bet Albert Einstein ain't have no time for these hoes
Fuck em and forget em
I was already successful girl
You knew what it was when you met me girl
Every time i tried to leave you wouldn't let me girl
Cause you wasn’t finished tryna' to finesse me girl
Don't you know that bitch will pull the trigger like a nigga
Don't you trust none of these bitches
They gon' kill you like a nigga
Don't you trust a bitch that bitch will kill you like a nigga
Don't you know that bitch will run up pull the trigger like a nigga
Pussy gon' kill you the head gon' thrill you
In exchange for your soul
She gon' make you feel alright and lose sight of the real you
I'm tryna tell you

[Outro]
She called me drunk and high crying trying to apologize
I ain't got no time
She called me drunk and high crying trying to apologize
I ain't got no time
