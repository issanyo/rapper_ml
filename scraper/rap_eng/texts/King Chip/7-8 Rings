[Verse 1: King Chip]
King Chip in this bitch, valet park the chariot
When I'm walking on rose petals I ain't hearing it
Can't tell me shit with $30,000 shoes on
Even if I'm is wrong, naw nigga you wrong
Damn these bitches love me, they say I should be in movies
I just signed with the C.A.A., they wish just might come truly
Hell yes she's got that booty, do I got to say it
That head and pussy crazy, type I got to spend the day with
Niggas see me on TV and be like damn Chip you made it
But, if you ask me I need a few more toys to play with
Bitch don't stare too long cause your panties will get creamy
I was looking like a natural king like every time you see me

[Hook: King Chip]
7-8 rings
And you know a nigga rock 'bout 7-8 rings [x8]

[Verse 2: King Chip]
I'm the coldest nigga who is ever on this earth, ho
Yee ain't tryna ball out then what the fuck you work for
People only doubt you cause they know for sure that they can't
I been spending so much paper, damn I need to take a vacay
Put me in a place where I can walk around and buy shit
Put me in a place where it's some bitches on some fly shit
Reminder bitch, you got a stupid question not to ask
Trigger finger ringless case I gotta pop your ass
Get these niggas heads chopped like the king that I am
Eating like a mob boss, little chubby yea I am
If you fuckin with a real king ain't no losing
Told these bitches kiss the ring just to let me know they choosin
Catch me on Twitter going ham on the pastures
King Chip ain't no bitch, father I'm a master
Sippin some patrossi, with some bitches in the posse
Whippin up millions on my iPhone and I know my ghetto got me

[Hook]
