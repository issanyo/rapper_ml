Yeah, we in this ho
Me and my niggas, we in this ho
Make room (make some room nigga) we in this ho
Bitch, bitch we in this ho
(Pour that shit up nigga)

[Verse 1]
Yeah, I'm mister young nigga that came straight outta jungle jumanji
Chillin' on St. Clair where you can find me
Escalade, pistol beside me
If you don't know me don't say hi cause I'mma be thinkin' that you tryna rob me
Round my hood niggas is grimy
Off in the cut, where you can find me
Making the room cloudy
Nigga no puff puff pass we roll them personal blunts
Gettin' this bread, all through the calendar nigga not just on the first of the month
I travel the map, lettin' these hoes know how these Cleveland niggas get down
Some ho ass niggas back at the crib
Tried to play me, look at me now
I got yo bitch, never pick up the phone unless I'm in town
She stalkin' me, doing her research tryna find out when I'm comin' around
These hoes just wanna be seen, I'm not gon' showcase you, I'll pass
Louie Vuitton, DC bag, Dior's hangin' off my ass

[Hook]
Yeah, we in this ho
Me and my niggas, we in this how
Make room (make some room nigga) we in this ho
Bitch, bitch we in this ho
Travel all across the map (SLAB ENT nigga)
A-ask about Chip they gon' say 'oh yeah I'm feelin' that'
(Pour that shit up nigga)
We in this ho, we in this ho
A-ask about Chip they gon' say 'oh yeah I'm feelin' that'

[Verse 2]
I let my pants sag to let the whole world know I'm is a nigga
And if you disrespect me then I'm gon' fuck this bitch up
I'm fre$h than a motherfucker everyday workin' tryna get my shit right
Tryin' to maintain in this cold world is like heel toein' on thin ice
Lightin' up non-stop THC, focus on more dollars
So much stress in my life there's a whole nother world of problems
Been a young G my whole life so many of these niggas can't stop me
Lotta these niggas is bitch made, I'm what you can't copy
I'm so cold these hoes know
In the club blowin' smoke
Gettin' chose not choosin'
Niggas in here straight losin'
Me and my niggas just touched down
Now we in here scorin'
Make some room for these hoes yo
Keep that Ros√© pourin' we good
