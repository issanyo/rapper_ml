King Chip

A nigga just left out landmarks
On 55th and I'm feelin' well
Told my nigga Ma$e
Before he got locked up I was gonna give him hell

Reminiscing my past life
As a young nigga tryna hit a lick
Only thing you can say about chip
Is that nigga cold in that denim shit

I'm all in the hood politics
If you pop in then they watching you
Just found out this badass bitch
In cleveland heights was prostitute

These hoes wanna fuck with the king
Cuz they heard I got lots of loot
Bitch ass nigga wanna pose a threat to a real king
Then I got to shoot

Blow these whole nigga heads off
Then I'm headin off to feelin good
Moved out to? 55
Might catch a nigga in hollywood

My uncle is laying down
I'm used to seein him breathing
Came back home for a funeral
THis ain't nothin new this cleveland

I'm lookin forward to never lookin back again
Cuz I'm a dad now
All that young shit I was on can't take it back
But that's dead now

Damn I done got my mind right
4 blunts rolled and a double cup???
Got no stress cuz I don't give no fuck

And it's 7am on St. Clair
It's 7am

My nigga it's 7am on st. clair
And I'm feelin good
Nigga I can float through any hood
Nigga I float through any hood

Ray Cash

Started from the bottom
Started from the gutter
And she in my bed

You know I get bread
Better believe that pussy's butter
She give good head

I used to get bread
WIth her older brother
Til the judge gave him two

But he kept it true
You know old girl do
Baby mother, yup
Small world

Nigga I'm just tryna function
Just licked a liq store on london
At the light just me and my weapon
At the marathon on 152nd

Police all in my sight
Pulled right to fuck up my night?
Sippin' my double sprite life is a forty
Take me a sip as I ride by the forty

Double cup eases the pain
Molly all up in her drink
Kush in the air what is the Clair
We're on 117

Shout out to my nigga Ma$e
Real niggas don't talk
If this was st clair 2008
Then I'd be with my nigga hawk

I'm on 99th in my own head
Breakin bread? chillin
Know real niggas from every hood
That's on st. clair and that county building

I'm certified
East side of King
My bitch a 10 fine queen
Went down the way got on the freeway
Got off on Martin Luther King

About 7am on St. Clair
It's 7am

My nigga it's 7am on St. Clair
And I'm smokin good
Nigga I can float through any hood
Nigga I float through any hood

It's 7am on St. Clair
It's 7am
It's 7am

My nigga it's 7am on st. clair
And I'm feelin good
Nigga I can float through any hood
Nigga I float through any hood
