[Verse 1]
I drop for no reason like building seven
RIP to those in heaven
Fuck the rules, fuck Armageddon
I don't believe that bullshit that yall been tellin'
And fuck TV, they trying to control my brain
Bad girls club got you hoes going insane
Now we're getting this bread, Oh no we're getting this paper
Cuz when you're broke you be pissed off
Breathin' hard like Darth Vader
?, That's a woman's name
I don't see no haters, I just see this change
I don't wear no chains, I just wear pussy
I wasn't on that freshman list cuz bitch I ain't no rookie
I've been livin' off this rap, bout seven years back
All we see is stacks and we got straps on straps on straps
It's nothing you can do except move when we comin' through
I'm in that new-new, you niggas tall tees and FUBU
I'm bruh man fifth floor, we got seventy-six hoes
Bitch we heavily get dough, it's something you never seen before
And you know we rolling blunts cuz that's what real G's puff
If you ain't feelin' these raps, then you can feel these nuts
With ya mouth

[Hook]
Every time you see me I be high as fuck
Every time you see me I be fly as fuck
All these pretty hoes I'm with is high as fuck
That Louis Vuitton I just can't buy enough

[Verse 2]
I drop for no reason like building seven
RIP to those in heaven
Posted with them choppers on your real estate
Wild and crazy hoods, bitch I'm from the realest state
My nigga this that laid back stoner flow
Bad bitch I'm rolling with said pump her gas, I told her no
She my chauffeur, my nigga she could take me there
In the back seat with here friend, she butt naked, yeah
We in the parking lot sippin' champagne
Hoes don't even make in the club they out here givin' brain
In the back seat of that truck with the rims shined up
Yo my nig pass me that blunt, we in here gettin' fried up
You know I don't give a fuck, just cop a bigger truck
Just go hop in a newer Benz, smoked out, tinted up
I ain't in the old school, I'm in the Benz playin' hookie
Yeah you see a nigga shining girl give him some pussy

[Hook]
