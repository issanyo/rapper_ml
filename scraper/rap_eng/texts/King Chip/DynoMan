Verse 1

This life is like DynoMan
Running wild I ain't got no plan
In the night time I'm hollow man
Blending in, body snatching, party rocking, dough stacking
For sure captain
Tryna make some more happen, this cold rapping
Got my change up, tangible goods
I'm more luxurious than they should
Living past necessities grinding still
Roll em up so my mind can build
Time reveals, the underdog was on top and won't stop
Came from playing any bounce with tennis balls and dough blocks
Me and my niggers, I was still tryna figure out why I was living
Many jobs I worked, tryna stay in business
Many setbacks, different women
Niggers died, niggers made it
Some went to prison, revenue streams no levies on em
Free agents still up in this game scoring
No hands in these pockets we gon' show em
These niggers playing I'm just saying that shit that you should live
I knew I had a purpose since I was a ruthless kid
Stupid shit I did man you see the bigger photo
If you ain't got no siamese twin then you on the dolo
DynoMan...
