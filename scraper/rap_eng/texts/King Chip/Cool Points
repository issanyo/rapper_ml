[Verse 1]
Louis Vuitton, Dior for sure
I just touched down, I'm tryna score some more
My personality is insanity mixed with wisdom
Today the day they let my nigga Arc up out that prison
So we bout to hit the mall as soon as I come off tour
He showed me how to live, I owe him a little more
In this world where they say that you don't owe nobody nothing
All I ever had was my niggas, since a youngin
On the front porch, heard them shots it was nothin'
Dope boys had what the celebrities had, stuntin'
So being starstruck by the nigga from St. Clair
Bringing two or three whips out a year just wasn't fair
As a young nigga I looked up to that
But now I'm older, wiser, I don't fuck with that
I'm trying to live for real, and get this paper and chill
Sometimes I wish the fame ain't come with these raps I spill
And I blast to kill, I got that 40 on me all times, that's for real
This really my life, these ain't no acting skills
Cause you can act like you 'bout to bust a move and get killed
Whoever look like they up to something, that's they ass
I'm from where niggas shoot first and don't never ask, nigga
You better stay up on your current events
Fuck the mainstream, the world don't deserve this

Now have you heard of this nigga named Chip? (Cool points)

Don't be bumping that bullshit

Don't be playing that bullshit

[Verse 2]
I'm scared to go to sleep at night, I might not wake up
I'm trying to shine, like something fresh out of Jacob
I want to be good, but nigga I'm trying to cake up
I need a bitch who a 10 before the makeup
And if not, give me the pussy with no hassle
I'm a king, where my crown, where my castle
On average I come near death like twice a week
See a Cleveland nigga on the street, we don't like to speak
If these hoes know what's up, are you DTF or what?
My lifestyle too fast to be your man, bitch don't hold me up
After I ooze, I gots to make moves
Niggas end up on the news for running up on them fools
Yo, my hood got its own government, fuck the rules
Little niggas in my hood got way too much to prove
And not too much to lose, cause most of they fam in jail or dead
And you wonder why them young boys never scared
Just tryna get hella bread, too much pussy, hella (?)
I'm just tryna do what I done cause these niggas never did
Try to keep a level head, show 'em what this life about
Corny-ass niggas stepping up to bat and striking out
If I hit the club I got that weapon on me always
But all I get is love, so we party and we all blaze
Vaporizer, get higher than the stratosphere
And get some money, get some dome, and we outta here
