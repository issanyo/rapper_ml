[Intro]
Yeah, dolo, bitch

You ain't shit without your homies
You ain't shit without your homies

[Verse 1]
I do my dirt up by my lonely
Niggas just hold they shit without your homie
You niggas tryna jazz on me, tryna clone me
I regret every last dab, oh you phony
Bitch, I'm the California cool and
Bitch, I'm a one man movement
That's the whole point of being a King, you fucking goofies
If I  up the [?] I ain't gon' aiming where the roof is
It's gon' hit you in your nose and your tomb bitch
Ham back your head and look like [?] bitch
Getting crazy, don from my new bitch
It's Chip tha Rip, King Chip, what it do, bitch

You ain't shit without your homies
You ain't shit without your homies
I do my dirt up by my lonely

You ain't shit without your homies
You ain't shit without your homies

[Verse 2]
I do my dirt up by my lonely
Can't nobody play me, can't nobody fold me?
These niggas think they know me cause they know the old me
Bust him in his neck and let the pussy die slowly
I catch these niggas by they self they wanna talk it out
Catch these niggas by they self they don't know what I'm talking 'bout
Catch these niggas by they self they wanna get me up
And notice how, I ain't need nobody here to back me up
Bitch, my loud challenge with the selfie
I made this beat all by myself and ain't nobody helped me
I die before you talk my son's father was a hoe
I became a man, I ain't that boy you knew before
I caught you walking out the store, hopped out and [?]
Dropped your back and ran it up the floor and start to dump
I make sure that you hit the ground and you was [?]
I guess it's done in less than 30 seconds, nothing to it

[Hook]
I do my dirt up on my lonely
I do my dirt up on my lonely
You ain't shit without your homies
You ain't shit without your homies
I do my dirt up on my lonely
I do my dirt up on my lonely
You ain't shit without your homies
You ain't shit without your homies
