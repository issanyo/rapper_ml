[Verse 1]
Got damn we 'bout that
Better ask around let the OG's know
Kick the door, get the fuck on the floor
Better go on ahead, let the OG's know

Think it's sweet, let the whole thing go
Give a fuck what you did before

Got a tek-9 with a 50 round clip
Doing fine, I ain't worried 'bout shit

Catch these niggas all up in the club
Catch these niggas sitting in the Porsche
Say God damn this life a fucking blur

Young niggas in the hood running wild
