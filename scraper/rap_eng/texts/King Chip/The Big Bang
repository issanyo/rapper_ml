[Verse 1]
Thank god a nigga saw another year
Besides almighty god I dont have another fear
The big bang the same as anarchy right?
Imagine niggas in the hood with no passion for Christ
Yikes, blowing niggas out they Nikes
Before shit hit the fan I'm a grab me a flight
St. Thomas beach house
Jamaica for the winter
Seasons South Beach summer
Then bring it back to Cleveland
For the weekend
Scoop up my niggas before the world end
Take ‘em to the planet I be hurled in
Young nigga on some grown man shit
Getting more bread than yo old man get
The finest women that you ever seen at my crib
Fixing me up big ass sandwich and shit
Oh yeah boo, hurry up and roll up
Before the world blow up
She turned back and said sure enough

[Hook]
Cause now they trying to compare god to Santa Clause
Dammit y'all we was doing good what happened y'all
Lock us up for weed when we dying from alcohol
Cigarettes, Xanax, ex and adderall
What happened y'all?
What happened?
What happened y'all?
What happened?

[Verse 2]
Knowledge is power but wisdom is even stronger
I won't be fucking with these leech as niggas any longer
These tattoos and for decoration they represent pain
Frustration trying to exercise my fucking will to gain
In this world where it wasn't designed for me to shine
I took mine, gimme that shit you better respect my fucking mind
You niggas ain't saying nothing your time has come to an end
I’ve been blessed with this voice to make you niggas comprehend
Underdogs to the fullest, fuck you was in my facial
But thank you, to all my supporters I'm very grateful
Fateful, and I promise not to waste you niggas time
Them niggas ain't saying nothing these words to live by
Be aware of what's real and whats not
Certain products that we consume we should stop
Stay away form high fructose corn syrup
These niggas think they slick trying to poison the whole world

[Hook]
