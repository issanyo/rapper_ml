Hey
DJ EV

[Hook: Chip Tha Ripper]
Ain’t nobody give me nothing, bitch I got it on my own
I’m the coldest where I’m from plus my hustle too strong
How the fuck you gon’ stop me?
All you can do is watch me
I can make it across the globe, all my niggas, King K
I’m all about the dollar [?]
How the fuck you gon’ stop me?
What y’all niggas do is watch me

[Verse 1: Chip Tha Ripper]
Money over you
Okay now let’s begin
I can show niggas the game like ESPN
God dropped me off, I’m in the same spot he left me in
So I’mma steal win, if you ain’t tryna let me win
And if you think I’mma lose, my nigga [?]
I got a hundred thousand [?]
Really more than that but let’s just keep it fair
And if you wasn’t my nigga then you was never there
So I know who my niggas is, all my slap niggas is
Right there, get me, just like all your bitches is
My buzz, ridiculous, your buzz is so worse
I’m in a Q35 Infiniti doing [?]

Keep them 20 songs, niggas is [?]
You know where to find me, like there in the hood
Cleveland, I gotcha, you’re good

[Hook: Chip Tha Ripper]
Ain’t nobody give me nothing, bitch I got it on my own

How the fuck you gon’ stop me?
All you can do is watch me
I can make it across the globe, all my niggas, King K
I’m all about the dollar [?]
How the fuck you gon’ stop me?

[Verse 2: Kid Cudi]
Oh what a feeling fam
Who ever knew I make it out of Shaker Land
Got no way niggas used to hate that man
Cause of his low [?]
I’ve achieved so much, check out my [?]
Dawg I travel the world with frequent fly miles
And they can frequently tryna be fly [?]
I can’t be great if there’s no hope alive and no [?]
Base so low and then I’m runnin’ for that home play
Cleveland is home base, so is the Tri state
That explains why my demeanor is different from they
But with my Cleveland face, dodging the Cleveland fate
I had to leave that place, to find a different pace
How can you blame a nigga rollin’ stoned, mention the future
Then they gon’ name a nigga, hey
Now all the red bones wanna go half on baby’s
From the home of the Shady’s
Didn’t let them phase me, change me

[Hook: Chip Tha Ripper]
Ain’t nobody give me nothing, bitch I got it on my own
I’m the coldest where I’m from plus my hustle too strong
How the fuck you gon’ stop me?
All you can do is watch me
I can make it across the globe, all my niggas, King K
I’m all about the dollar [?]
How the fuck you gon’ stop me?
What y’all niggas do is watch me

[Verse 3: Chip Tha Ripper]
Smooth with that raw shit, [?]
Niggas don’t hustle like I do, I make it happen without you
My real niggas I got you, you phonies know what to stun
Free my nigga [?], slap niggas is best
And hoes be on my nut, squirrell, [?]
I’m all about my fetti on some real girl pimpin’
If a nigga ain’t talkin’ ‘bout a dollar, I ain’t listenin’
I’m tryna [?] and you tryna [?]
And biggie nigga you clueless just what to do with this music
So just be through with it, I show you how to do this shit
Mind of a hustler and a customer, who the shit
I really do this shit and you just kinda fell into this shit
Slab niggas teasing, [?]
Keep a crew of white dudes, just to [?]
You can ask the streets ‘bout that nigga Chip
You know that I’m the number one pimp

[Outro: Kid Cudi]
Fuck
Y’all niggas don’t understand me
This ain’t no joke
We can’t be stopped
Niggas can’t stop us
Niggas can’t stop me
