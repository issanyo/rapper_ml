I'm a activist sipping actavis
In the back of this cadillac with this
Purple sprite
Know I'm thuggin' know I'm feeling alright
I'm a activist sipping actavis
In the back of this cadillac with this
Purple sprite
Know I'm thuggin' know I'm feeling alright

[Verse 1]
Ain't nobody never gave no fuck about no nigga man
Know it nigga, smoking weed to help keep me sane
Rest in peace my nigga hawk he left me in 2011
Niggas ran up in his crib and hit him in his brain
Praying with my nigga dog, care for my nigga lord
Help a young nigga while I try to find my way
Damn it was my nigga dog, care for my nigga lord
Help a young nigga, I just bought this new AK
Weaving, bob and weaving throwing punches at the world
Yeah I'm fighting back cause I ain't no ho
Grieving, my niggas dying
Niggas changing on me not that I got money
I ain't got no where to go
Theres so many people in the world with so many problems
Wonder who would give a fuck about mine
Paid 350 for the pint 2 liter sprite
Yeah this shit is dirty nigga had a long night

I'm a activist sipping actavis

Purple sprite
Know I'm thuggin' know I'm feeling alright
I'm a activist sipping actavis
In the back of this cadillac with this
Purple sprite
Know I'm thuggin' know I'm feeling alright

As I pour another cup
I think to myself
The only thing worth getting heard in my life
Is what you take the sin up out my life
As I pour another cup
As I pour another cup
As I pour another cup, my niggas

[Verse 2]
Stress never the less a nigga blessed
Frustrated cause I know I'm better than this
Alone, I am alone, alone is me
Prone cause in my zone to be a G
The world told me lies, killed my friends
The world, fuck the world till it ends
Got a pint for the night, treat it like gold
I need more stress gone I'm moving slow
