[Verse 1: Chip tha Ripper]
I'm ballin forty in my hand
Bet this motherfucker won't NBA Jam
Up the Springfield, don't think my aim off
My Louie Jacket cost more then ya chain cost
I'm finna act up, not sober (drunk as fuck)
I'm strapped up, glaucoma (fuck you up)
Hot damn, son of a bitch
Tell your daddy hush don't be a son of a snitch
Turn the t.v. on, they tellin' stories
Turn your bitches on, she extra horny
You know what I'm on, with your fine ass
She got red lipstick on the wine glass
I know you niggas mad, I see you tail wagging
Act like you got some sense or something bad will happen
She got off work and came straight to the club
Your bitch tryna catch a date with some rich thugs
And you mad

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Bun B]
Trill OG Bun B all ready
Trigger finger on the trigger and it's all steady
No problem is too big or too small
Got the third eye to see around corners and through walls
No matter who calls we answer first ring
Mind on the money baby that's the first thing
Got your baby mama, by her purse strings
Losing her to me wouldn't be the worst thing
This that mob music, strictly for made men
Run up like you want it you can catch up fade then
I ain't playin I'll pop you and then I'm not stayin
They gone find you right there in the same spot you lay in
I'm not the one and I'm not the two bro
I'm the cat who gone make it do what it do bro
And you know so act right
Cause I'm gonna keep the mack tight make it go boomshakalaka

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Chip tha Ripper]
I'm what you call a living legend (sha-plow)
This what you call a mack eleven (sha-plow)
Here's two on the way down (plow plow)
Here's four more (plow plow plow plow)
I got a plan to take over your land
If you keep it one hundred I keep it hundred grand
I'm not a star you know my name now my story
You simple you represent fame I rep glory
Damn now these nigga's talking down
But they don't say nothin' when I'm around
We don't fuck with y'all no dap you get a pound
Naw, matter of fact fuck that you get a round
I don't' hang with industry niggas I hang with killers
I don't fuck with these rap niggas they ain't my niggas
My whole outfit from Paris
Show up to your house party like Robin Harris with the
