King Chip
East side of Cleveland, south side of Chicago

[Verse 1: King Chip]
Blessed with a gift by god
I'mma take my time
Let me get mine
Let me get mo'
Tryna' spend his most time
As I can with myself
When you gotta go
Nigga never know
Way too many niggas in my lane
I'mma bust 'em in they brain
Let my nuts hang ain't no thing
Nigga must be heavy off the 'caine
With a fake ass chain don't use my name in vain
All y'all niggas farm hoes
My heart is cold
Hella hella cold
Hella hella cold
I don't give a fuck about no hoes, broke bitch
Better know that you fucking with a nigga with the glo
Kill these niggas in they face, don't leave no trace
Hit a lick then splash that ace
Naw' I ain't in the rap race, hella steady on the pace
When the whole hood know my face
Bought my whips and cribs from selling these thots (thes thots)
Fucking these thots
Niggas broke a whole bunch of part in a young nigga heart
Bitch I don't give a fuck what you got
Rest in peace Young Hock
Kid it ain't gon' stop
Sucker free until they put me in the box
I don't give a fuck about the talk
Nigga I'm a St. Clair Ox

[Verse 2: Fredo Santana]
I don't give a fuck if it's day time
I don't give a fuck if it's dark
I'mma pull up, I'mma let it pop
I'mma pull up, ain't gon' park
I'mma let it spark
Aiming at your head
Aiming at your nose
Aiming at your heart (What, what?)
Remember being broke
Thank god for the motherfucking pots (Whip!)
I don't know where you going
But I'm going to the motherfucking top (To the top!)
I'mma pull up in the drive (SKRT, SKRT!)
I'mma pull up with a thot (With a thot!)
Hell nah I don't talk to the cops (Nah, nah)
Hell nah I don't talk to the opps (Nah, nah)
Wanna be a tough guy?
Well take these five shots (Bang, bang!)
Remember stash crack in my sock
Remember sleeping in the trash pot
The way this is the beginning, even when it's hard (I work)
Nigga see me winning, now they want my spot (My spot)
Pull up with this chopper, I kill that parking lot (Grrah, grrah)

[Outro]

I don't give a fuck if it's day time, I don't give a fuck if it's dark
I don't give a fuck if it's day time, I don't give a fuck if it's dark
I don't give a fuck if it's day time, I don't give a fuck if it's dark
I'mma pull up, I'mma let it spark, I'mma pull up, ain't gon' park
I don't give a fuck if it's day time, I don't give a fuck if it's dark
I'mma pull up, I'mma let it spark, I'mma pull up, ain't gon' park
