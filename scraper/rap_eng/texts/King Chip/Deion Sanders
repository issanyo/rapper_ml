[Intro]
Y’all niggas, y’all niggas, y’all niggas, y’all niggas…
Y’all niggas, y’all niggas, y’all niggas, y’all niggas…
Y’all, y’all niggas, y’all niggas, y’all niggas, y’all niggas…
Y’all…

[Verse 1]
King Chip, extra fresh, put that on my mama neck
Light skinned with the mens chillin’ right beside of him
Booty California, shout-out to my cousin Jonathan
Been in jail his whole life, now he out here tryin’ to win
Yeah I’m swaggin’ like Deion Sanders
When he had the Jheri curl and all the answers
They gon’ talk about a king until the end of time
Endo breath up in my lungs, and bitch you know I’m finna grind
King Chip worth more than Wells Fargo
But the blunt out on the glass and the marble
Here this nigga go, so full of himself, oh god
Give me head, bitch - blowjob better than no job
She love the way I don’t care, wanna get married to me
Watchin’ news in Cleveland scarier than scary movies
Smokin’ in my hotel at the Ritz, tryin’ not to ash on tits
However you feel about Chip sure ain’t gon’ change all this

[Hook]
Y’all, y’all niggas got the game fucked up
Y’all, y’all niggas got the game fucked up
Y’all niggas, y’all niggas got the game fucked up
Y’all, y’all niggas, y’all niggas, y’all, y’all, y’all niggas…

[Verse 2]
I promise not many niggas livin’ like this
If I was only two hundred I still wouldn’t give two shits
When I spray the tek, all your niggas gon’ desert you
Knowin’ not to fuck with King Chip is a virtue
Pulled up and she got it wearin’ nothin’ but a leather coat
Damn that pussy wet, when she got out, had on my leather, so
Don’t be chasin’ women if she wanna throw a deuce up
(Y’all, y’all niggas got the game fucked up…)
I’m the most organic rap nigga in the galaxy
I don’t fuck with broke hoes, bitch, that’s my policy
We ain’t got no blunts? Ah, fuck it – roll a joint then
King Chip swaggin’ on your daddy and your boyfriend
Offer me the pussy, I ain’t ‘bout to ask “can I?”
Livin’ on the road, got my condo in the Semi
Who gives a fuck if you Democrat or Republican
Is you ballin’ like a king or is your broke as them fucked boys?

[Hook x2]
