(Verse 1)
I just want to be, Fly
And pay no mind to these niggas comin' up to me askin' me about mine
That's why, I keep them Louis frames on my nose
And, I, keep that Polo man on my clothes
If I was dead and they recollected
Why he don't rock a necklace but fresher than you expected
Damn, why is you askin' him all these questions?
Can't he chill for a second?
Nah, he'll get your message, on Myspace
Get your little Jimmy Neutron head ass out of my face
Unless you got cake
And you tryna put it in my H-A- N- D
If not gimme dap say hey then leave
Or neither one of them options
I'm from where you say hello, they just look at you, keep walkin'
Somebody call for my valet parkin'
Gave the waitress a tip, I said stay out of the dark in Cleveland

(Hook)
Hold on, you did what?
Gave the waitress a tip, I said stay out of the dark in Cleveland. (x3)

(Verse 2)
Yes, 2 gun clips, 216, and I'm good
A nigga be fresh, ahead of the rest
But nevertheless, I'm dealin' with stress
Cause niggas is phony, fuck a new homie
Rather be lonely, niggas can't slow me down
Or stop me, Me and my posse
Keepin' it humble, we never stumble
I'm from the jungle, no they won't jump you
They'd rather kill you, nah we don't feel you
Fuck an emotion, niggas is broke
With nothin' to lose except they freedom
Takin' they chances, lookin' for answers
Empty those pockets, yeah, we gon' need em
90 percent of these rappers is whack and out here in Cleveland we don't believe em
Bein' real is like a talent, most don't have, they never had it
We been had it, reefer addicts
SLAB E.N.T, where dreams can happen, Damn
Daydreamin' this whole verse
Sittin' here at this restaurant
Now I'm full, waiter comes up and asks
"Is anything else you want"
Just respect, just the check, please
Now we leavin', gave the waiter a tip
I wrote stay out of the dark in Cleveland

(Hook)
