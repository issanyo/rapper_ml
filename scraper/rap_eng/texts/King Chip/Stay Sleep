These niggas sleeping on the kid
Well they can stay asleep so they could dream about how we live
It’s when you sleeping on Chip. What?
These niggas sleeping on the kid
Well they can stay sleep so they could dream about how we live
These niggas sleeping on the …

[Verse 1: Chip Tha Ripper]
I ain’t ask for this life, it simply asked for me
It’s so many others who’d do what I do
I wonder how this shit is working for me
We running amok and I ain’t giving a fuck
My nigga we living it up
Travel the map, tell them sexy hoes to get on the bus
Bottles of Jameson and the goose, while we’re on the tour bus
It’s 4 of us, we’re trying to get these girls to absorb us
Trying to stay focus, back home they want me dead
I can feel it, ain’t nobody got the say it
I’m ready for war at all times
My nigga this shit is so real
I’m trying to cop a couple of cribs around the world
So I could chill stress free and relax
Just 300, some niggas is sorry
Cause we getting paper, they wanna be in on the money
These niggas is not my fam, these niggas is not my comrades
We keeping the circle tight as a Cheerio
That’s how I am gonna last in this world where
Niggas come up off other niggas
We did this, no help from phoney snake in the grass pretenders

[HOOK: Chip Tha Ripper]
What you say these niggas sleeping on chip
When they could stay sleep so they could dream this shit
What you say these niggas sleeping on the kid
When they could stay sleep so they could dream this shit
What you say these niggas sleeping on Chip
When they could stay sleep so they could dream this shit
What you say these niggas sleeping on the kid
Or they could stay sleep so they could dream about how we live

[Verse 2: Krayzie Bone]
We living the life for real, living it right, nigga we getting it into the night
Mentality… if you are the mind, then you are the sight
My nigga we grind hard
And if that means then we gotta die, then nigga we’ll die hard
But I keep this heat my nigga, on easy
I will light y'all up, like you was rolled up in the blunt
So nigga don’t front, don’t ever run up on me bluffing
Trust you niggas don’t want this
I represent it to the fullest the city is Cleveland
But nigga we gotta believe that it's our time, go get it and quit blamin' shit on Lebron
This is 24/7 the grinder, call me greedy the grimer
Cleveland city… guess it's just in need to rise up
From the bottom of the … to the southern …air
They thought I was over…give up the game
Are you sleeping me?
He must have been dreaming..
But I can turn that dream into a nightmare

[Verse 3: Chip Tha Ripper]
Stay up all night trying to make a better plan
Gotta play chess with life, and don’t never show these niggas your hand
I can do all things, through Christ
Who strengthens me, anything that happens in this crazy life was meant to be
It’s … from Cleveland, don’t get it confusing
…you got no hustling, you loosing if you …
Niggas tripping, I’m trying to learn to be a better person
Don’t fuck with .. my brother, that shit will kill you for certain thing
I am that perfect verse over a dope beat, don’t be, running up trying to act like you know me
Roll 3 hundred more blunts, I’m trying to smoke G
Saint Clair, original legend…
We off in the club with your bitch…
Shit’s so real that we can give a fuck if niggas not convinced
That we living like this
My nigga you must be crazy, if you don’t think… going nuts
