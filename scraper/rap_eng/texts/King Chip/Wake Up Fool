[Verse 1]

Riding with a uzi, and 3 niggas with the shotty's
And 2 hotties, a purple Bugatti, a candy Ferrari
Crashed then flew out the windshield, tuck & roll
Hopped up, bloody nose, fuck it nigga here we go
Shots ring out, I duck, running through the woods
Pulled out my phone called Big Foot said "Look
Punch the shit out these niggas like you did that one nigga
In that beef jerky commercial he said well no one will hurt you"
Then hung up. Then a goddamn ninja popped out
And started throwing ninja stars at me, got me
Blood everywhere I keep falling to the grass
Samurai sword in his hand while he just laugh
No, that was just a dream, now I'm woke
Thank you Geeze, wipe the crust out my eyes
Brush my teeth I have hygiene, then spark them tweeds
That I need to succeed, that trojan ganja got no seeds
Then after all that I give them hoes a call back
Well, on second thought maybe I'mma fall back
Cause all that riff raft ain't even what's happening
Just go wake up Mr Mcnaire and ask him
More love less blasting, check it
Voice mail full, first unheard message
Was a pretty young thing trying to give me a message
I mean massage, I mean besides
The simple fact that I gotta get paid for today
Hey, I charge the world to stack for me to wake and get
Unless you trying to come over and get naked
I used to hound the pussy now I can't shake it
I jumped up, juke spin move from the pussy
It's like Madden, in the end zone a bunch of money
So touchdown Hopkins, baggage claim Jenkins
Shoe game stankin', Louie frames reeking
Now tell me can you smell me
Ladies can you feel me
I only pay attention
It ain't nothing you could sell me
A hustler from Cleveland, niggas busting every evening
Murder rate top 3 and ain't even a million people
More DC to grind till we equal
Lick the balls make sure you get every wrinkle now
We was down but we up now
All mighty glory us, when you see us bow, nigga
