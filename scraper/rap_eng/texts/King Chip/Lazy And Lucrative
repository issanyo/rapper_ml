[Hook: King Chip]
All I wanna do is nothing, all day
Smoking and fucking, all day
All I wanna do is nothing, all day
Smoking and fucking, all day
All I wanna do is nothing, all day
Nigga, rather waste my days
All I wanna do is nothing, all day
Nigga, rather waste my days

[Verse 1: King Chip]
We go to work, just so we can chill
I don't go to work, so I just chill
Not moving a muscle is a thrill
Not moving a muscle, shut your thrill
And yeah, a nigga super chill
My car goes fast but I'm still sitting still
And yeah, a nigga super real
Yeah I tell you how I see it
I ain't tripping on how you feel
Lifting the blunt up to my lips
Shit is strong, got to give this kush a kiss
My life is effortless, I ain't fucking with this
I know what time it is, no rollie on the wrist
My niggas dead, yeah the homies I'ma miss
It's not another, I'm the only one like this
Elevators escalators in this bitch
Yeah I'm out in public but I still don't flinch

[Hook]
All I wanna do is nothing, all day
Smoking and fucking, all day
All I wanna do is nothing, all day
Smoking and fucking, all day
All I wanna do is nothing, all day
Nigga, rather waste my days
All I wanna do is nothing, all day
Nigga, rather waste my days

[Verse 2: King Chip]
It's like I'm Malcolm X, floating to his last speech
I'm on the segway, floating down Venice Beach
A Cleveland nigga, so bored and it's perfect
Last week I ain't do nothing, it was worth it
Yeah I rock and roll [?] up in my comfort zone
Anywhere I roam, a nigga feeling home
A nigga vegan I don't beef I just stack kale
I'm on the couch having a blast, can't you tell
Damn you still haven't held the new $100 bill
You been at work all week plus the overkill
All them hours that you spent, can't get them back
Plus you working hard pimp, yeah I'm digging that
A nigga must be blessed not to have to
Might call a hundred bitches over, get a tattoo
But tryna find a [?]
Fell into a weed coma, [?] begin to, damn

[Hook]
All I wanna do is nothing, all day
Smoking and fucking, all day
All I wanna do is nothing, all day
Smoking and fucking, all day
All I wanna do is nothing, all day
Nigga, rather waste my days
All I wanna do is nothing, all day
Nigga, rather waste my days

[Interlude]
Yeah
The Law of Attraction, can not feel
Even if I sit right here all year
I'm still gonna get to where I visualized myself to be

[Hook] x3
All I wanna do is nothing, all day
Smoking and fucking, all day
All I wanna do is nothing, all day
Smoking and fucking, all day
All I wanna do is nothing, all day
Nigga, rather waste my days
All I wanna do is nothing, all day
Nigga, rather waste my days
