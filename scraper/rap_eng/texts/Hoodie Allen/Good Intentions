[Verse 1]
It was all a dream
Bought an old whip when I was like fifteen
Thought it was fresh then
I was a freshman
Whatchu mean I got years to go?
That's why my '97 Honda's like a miracle
I tell 'em fuck a speed limit I never be timid
I rather ride around the town with these beautiful women
And let 'em ride in shotty while we be doing doughnuts like a Krispy Kreme
Oh you got a sugar rush, now you're missing me?
Go and tell your old boy that he history
No matter what he doing better tell him not to visit me
Cause my motto is to get it
So long as we driving it don't matter where we headed

[Bridge]
She tell me I'm a bad motherfucker
Cause bad motherfuckers do what they want
And we don't ever front
Your old man say I look suspicious
I am, you can tell him I'll be home for Christmas

[Hook]
Baby, baby I just got one simple rule
So let's start with good intentions
Start with good intentions ahh ohh
Got me crazy don't you play me for a fool
So let's start with good intentions
But I'll make an exception for you

[Verse 2]
Yeah, and I got a good memory
Your old dude's got the swag of a spelling bee
Damn, and I just wanna know your origin
Fuck it, I'm only playing like I was Bellamy
But this is hell to me
If you believe in celibacy
But look so fine that I can't understand what you're selling me
So act like you love my quick talkin'
Baby you can run I'm already Chris Walken
Ditch my old car for a brand new apartment
And I never lock the door cause I'm hoping that you walk in
But fuck it, she want me to Nicholas Spark it
Either way, I hit my target

[Bridge]
She tell me I'm a bad motherfucker
Cause bad motherfuckers do what they want
And we don't ever front, yup
Your old man say I look suspicious
I am, but at least I look good in pictures

[Hook]
Baby, baby I just got one simple rule
So let's start with good intentions
Start with good intentions ahh ohh
Got me crazy don't you play me for a fool
So let's start with good intentions
But I'll make an exception for you

[Interlude]
Girls in the club right now
They just wanna turn you down
Go and tell them
Fuck that shit
Fuck that shit
Guys in the club right now
Only trying to buy you rounds
Go and tell them
Fuck that shit
She be coming home with this

[Hook]
Baby, baby I just got one simple rule
So let's start with good intentions
Start with good intentions ahh ohh
Got me crazy don't you play me for a fool
So let's start with good intentions
But I'll make an exception for you
Baby, baby I just got one simple rule
So let's start with good intentions
Start with good intentions ahh ohh
Got me crazy don't you play me for a fool
So let's start with good intentions
But I'll make an exception for you
