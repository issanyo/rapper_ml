[Intro]
Your heart pounds with precision
A king dies inside his courts
Your heart pounds with precision
A king dies inside these doors
Let it all work out (x4)

[Verse 1]
Man
She asked me when you come into my college
Cause she's all about it
I said its 40,000
Dollars she ain't got em'
She begs her parents constantly
She got A's in all her classes
But I know she wants the D
Look at your kid do the math
Running over the game while you taking a nap
Vehicular manslaughter when they give me the rap
Probably gonna need a miracle to mirror me back
Make fans, move units
Tim Taylor that's home improvement
Cameras follow me everywhere
But don't call me Truman
Resume is like a Rubik's Cube
Cause it's hard to use
And I'm hardly using my brain
Fans screaming my name dog
Well that feeling's always insane
The band wagon bout to leave the station
So hop right on to that train
Always motivated my love
Never motivated by fame
Blink once it's like what's my age
They stressing off of my accolades
People tell me I'm doing great
But honestly I just can't relate ( I just can't relate)
And I'm going through some shit that got me stressing now
But like my homies told me
Let it all work out

[Chorus]
Let it all work out (x3)
Let it all work out, work work (x4)

[Verse 2]
Oh, Let me be the guy that I'm supposed to
The person that I envisioned
The boy who be all like "told ya"
My dream keep getting bigger with every year I get older
Some how got my diploma
And now own it like Oprah
I'm sorry I ain't bullshit in the minute
With all these bridges sometimes I get tunnel vision
I'm thinking how I'm bout to cross some long division
Only 5'9 but in the center wrong position
But I been in the game and I came to ball
Send one tweet like I came to the mall
Hundred motherfuckers gonna show right up
Tried that shit in Oklahoma city it was lite as fuck
Mothers drop their daughters off
Now they got me running like we never shut the water off
Homie take this Carter off
I throw trow your ass in gatorade
Always been a free agent but no my team they came to play
It could be
1 against 100
I promise they'll never stress me out
Cause like my homies told me
Let it all work out

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
You know they say like
99% of the things that we worry about everyday
Don't even happen
So I'm gonna spend all that extra time
Fucking your bitch
And when I'm done
We both could go to Applebee's
I'll tell her "you can get whatever you want"
She want that appetizer sampler
You can't get that sampler
But I got it, I got it like that
Bitch have all the buffalo wings you want
Next song
