[Intro]
All I want to do
Is sit and wait for you
All I want to do
Is sit and wait for you

[Verse 1]
Are you movin' ahead? Am I fallin' behind?
Fuck it, probably either way, it’s all in my mind
You got all that you want, I got nothin' but time
Honestly all we want is somebody to grind with
In a junior high prom, probably regrettin' my haircut
And the color of my tie, let's Photoshop it and airbrush
As long as the girl with me is flyer than Aaron/air miles
I'mma be a happy camper with nothin' to care about
Damn, well put, that's the way it goes
I know you say that you love him, but that was days ago
I moved to London and tried to find me a Daisy Lowe
I mean it can't be that hard to find a crazy ho
She high up on the Macy floor, I'm flowin' in my fast car
You want to watch the world end in my backyard
We go in circles, that's NASCAR

[Hook]
Only you get me high, high, high
High again
Leavin' your smell on my clothes
I think that I'm losin' my mind again
Baby, don't leave me alone
You get me high, high, high, high
All I want to do
Is sit and wait

[Verse 2]
Are you goin' with him, am I takin' you home
Fuck it, probably either way, I end up alone
You got all that you want, I got nothin' to show
Honestly all we want is somebody to bone
So can I get your phone number, your credit card, and your passport
You gave me this crude face like why did I ask for it
My plane to the UK, but I didn't pack for it
If this is a layup, then where is the backboard
A sinful investigation is makin' me unretired
I'm with you, I'm suffocating, my lungs are like fuckin' fire
There isn't an explanation you wouldn't try to get me high

[Hook]
High, high, high
High again
Leavin' your smell on my clothes
I think that I'm losin' my mind again
Baby, don't leave me alone
You get me high, high, high, high

[Bridge]
Nobody's gonna keep me down
You get me high again
My feet are floatin' off the ground
You get me high again
And every time that you’re around I’ll be down to stay by your side
Only you can get me this high

[Hook]
You get me high, high, high
High again
Leavin' your smell on my clothes
I think that I'm losin' my mind again
Baby, don't leave me alone
You get me high, high,  high
