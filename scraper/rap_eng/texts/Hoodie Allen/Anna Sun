[Intro]

[Verse 1: Kina Grannis]
Screen falling off the door - Door hanging from the hinges
My feet are still sore - My back is on the fringes
We tore up the wall - We slept on couches
[2x] We lifted this house

Oh, Anna Sun
Oh, Anna Sun

[Chorus]
What do you know? - This house is falling apart
What can I say? - This house is falling apart
We got no money - but we got our heart
We're gonna rattle this ghost town - this house is falling apart

[Verse 2: Hoodie Allen]
I don't wanna waste my time with
Girls who rolling they eyelids
Girls who lookin' for a place to stay
Cause they came away from Long Island
I don't wanna make your mind up
I'm just tryna make you mine quick
But ever since I put you in my line-up
All I do is choke: Heimlich
Good girl in a bad dress
Ain't nothing really changed but your address
In the Upper West Side
You were thinking of the people
That never would have accepted all your assets?
I'm Cassius, you cash poor
I'mma give you anything that you ask for
You a small town girl but you living in the city
Oh girl, you'll be living in the city now

Oh, Anna Sun
Oh, Anna Sun

[Chorus]
What do you know? - This house is falling apart
What can I say? - This house is falling apart
We got no money - but we got our heart
We're gonna rattle this ghost town
What do you know? - This house is falling apart
What can I say? - This house is falling apart
We got no money - but we got our heart
We're gonna rattle this ghost town - This house is falling apart
[2x] This house is falling apart
