[Intro]
Clap your hands now people clap now
Clap your hands now people clap your hands
Hey, Hoodie, Legend

[Verse 1]
And I'm feeling like, a suspect
And I'm sick to my stomach without a gut check
My money is super tall, they call it success
"Would you like to climb in my wallet?" She said, "Fuck yes"
Well now that we've came to an agreement
You should know I really mean it
Ms. Rapunzel with the cleavage,
Ivy League cause I'm a genius
I get girls Adam Levine did
Good jesus, what an achievement
People didn't believe it when they saw my first video
Yeah if I was hipster I woulda put it on Vimeo
Please don't handicap me #drizzyflow
Ran the whole time they wonder where I really go
Cause just about a year ago I made my life amazing
Now I'm Eric B. screaming "Cara is my agent"
Anyone that is hating I just give you plenty thanks, bro
This whole crowd is high, James Franco

[Hook]
Clap your hands now people clap now
Clap your hands now people clap your hands
Clap your hands now people clap now
Clap your hands now people clap your hands
Sing it with me
Franc - O, Franc - O, Franc - O, Franc - O

[Verse 2]
I said "screech, powers, slow it down, speed trap"
Cause all these white people want to talk is some weed rap
I'm with some underage women in a G-chat
Playing new songs cause I really need their feedback
I'm not impressed, get me press like I'm Clooney dude
Butterfingers gotta get a grip like a movie crew
Need a bad chick, good grades with the booty too
Feedin' me sushi so I call that woman Lucy Liu
Okay, that's loosely true, kind of based on facts and shit
Spend a lot of time asking God if this is happening
Mark Wahlberg of this rappin' shit never mind
Use a lot of famous people just to write some clever lines
I wonder if they'll hear it? If they'll notice?
If they ever wind up being My opponent
If I open up a beverage line?
Cause I'm thirsty, and I drink slow
And I hate Spiderman too, James Franco

[Hook]
Clap your hands now people clap now
Clap your hands now people clap your hands
Clap your hands now people clap now
Clap your hands now people clap your hands
Sing it with me
Franc - O, Franc - O, Franc - O, Franc - O

[Verse 3]
When I say "James" y'all say "Franco"
"James" "Franco" "James" "Franco"
When I say "James" y'all say "Franco"
"James" "Franco" "James" "Franco"
When I say "James" y'all say "Franco"
"James" "Franco" "James" "Franco" "James" "James" "Franco"
"James" "FRANCO"
Put the money in the bank bro, James Franco

[Hook]
Clap your hands now people clap now
Clap your hands now people clap your hands
Clap your hands now people clap now
Clap your hands now people clap your hands
Sing it one more time with me
Franc - O, Franc - O, Franc - O, Franc - O
