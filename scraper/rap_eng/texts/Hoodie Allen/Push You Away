[Verse 1]
Lamborghini doors, split to the caption
A motherfucker living out a life in the Hamptons
Oh my gosh, tragic, is it though?
Ended way faster than anyone imagined
Living like a wealthy man, anything can happen
She was just a sundress spotted in Manhattan
Now we getting undressed back room on the mattress
Got a tiny apartment but I hope that you will crash here
They say I didn't pay my dues, I don't ever need it
If everything you say is true, I do not believe it
Money's piling up I just feel like a bulimic
Throw it up throw it up and I'll leave it
Cause I'm driving in a Chevy that her daddy done bought
Pedal's getting heavy cause she's never on course
Grabbing to the clutch while she's trying to grab on to me (on to me)

[Hook]
So I'm telling her
Please don't get that close to me
Cause I just got a feeling that you won't like what you see (like what you see)
So you know I gotta
Push you away, push push you away
I gotta push you away, push push you away
I gotta (gotta)
Please don't get that close to me (that close to me)

[Verse 2]
Damn
Cheap wine plus the smell of some cigarettes
Goldilocks, there's another one in my bed
Let's keep the lights off, undercover, infrared
Telling me I think I liked you better on the internet
Living like a wealthy man, yeah she hates my lifestyle
Talking serious and hating it when I smile
I don't really need a wife, but I need a right now
Every mistake I make you taking me to time out
They say I didn't pay my dues, I don't ever need it
If everything you say is true, I do not believe it
Money's piling up I just feel like a bulimic
Throw it up throw it up and I'll leave it
Cause I'm driving in the city where my parents grew up
And the only thing that's changing is I finally blew up
Rollin down the window just to give myself some room to breathe (room to breathe)

[Hook]

[Outro]
Ba ba da ba ba da
Getting that close to me
Ba ba da ba ba da
Cause I been driving in this city in this pickup truck
And the only thing that matters, what you think of us
Packing up my bags, but I never really wanna leave (wanna leave)
So I'm telling her
Please don't get that close to me (that close to me, that close to me)
Cause I just got a feeling that you won't like what you see (I got a feeling that you won't like what you see)
So you know I gotta
Push you away (I gotta), push push you away
I gotta push you away (I gotta), push push you away
I gotta (gotta)
Please don't get that close to me (don't get that close to me)
