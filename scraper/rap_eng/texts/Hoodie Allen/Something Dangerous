[Chorus]
Let's do something that's crazy
Let's do something we've never done
Let's do something amazing
Let's do something we really want, cause
I don't care what we do, as long as it's new to us
In the mood for something dangerous

[Verse 1: Hoodie Allen]
I used to play it by the book
Never get out of line, but now it's time to mix it up
Catalina wine, why you always call my phone, thinking that I'm home?
Tryna' check on me like everywhere I go
Know that I can't be tamed
The consequences of fame
When your body and your name become public domain
I'm living in a space and time where I don't recognize
What's good for you and who's giving you bad advice
But as long as you're here, you know I'll stick with ya
Polaroid girl, you always get the big picture
You know I gotta go on tour sometimes, but like Shaq with the free throws, you know I'm always missing ya
There's something dangerous where everyone you date is a temporary arrangement
Where someone takes and someone gains from it
I hate this, but since you came along, it's like everything makes sense
All I gotta say is

[Chorus]
Let's do something that's crazy
Let's do something we've never done
Let's do something amazing
Let's do something we really want, cause
I don't care what we do, as long as it's new to us
In the mood for something dangerous
I don't care what we do, as long as it's new to us
In the mood for something dangerous

[Verse 2: Hoodie Allen]
Nowadays I'm feeling like we're strangers
Took a little break, we ain't really been the same since
I'm just looking for someone to run away with, just to hang with
Maybe we can get married in Vegas
So if you're in the mood, let's get dangerous
I know your old dude, he was shameless
This television famous
Can't remember your name
Tryna win back your girl with an Edible Arrangement
Lame shit
I'm in a league of my own
So put your seven digits in my cellular phone
And we can take it real slow
Cause I don't sweat it, girl, dog I ain't Ken Bone
Don't think you can pick a side, don't debate this
I never hit you up on some fake shit
I know a lot of dudes tryna chase you
But I'm the only one who ever made sense
Hoodie, babe

[Chorus]
Let's do something that's crazy
Let's do something we've never done
Let's do something amazing
Let's do something we really want
I don't care what we do, as long as it's new to us
In the mood for something dangerous
I don't care what we do, as long as it's new to us
In the mood for something dangerous

[Bridge: Hoodie Allen]
If you're feeling dangerous
Put your hands in the sky like you're prayin'
Girl you work so hard, you deserve a vacation
You deserve a vacation
No more job applications
Girl you already know you the greatest
Put your hands in the sky like you made it
Three, two, one, go

[Chorus]
Let's do something that's crazy
Let's do something we've never done
Let's do something amazing
Let's do something we really want, cause
I don't care what we do, as long as it's new to us
In the mood for something dangerous
I don't care what we do, as long as it's new to us
In the mood for something dangerous
