[Verse 1: Hoodie Allen]
I used to have a dream I could buy my way to heaven
Even made a promise that I never would forget it
Dreams are kinda fuzzy after exiting my bed
And now the only way to keep it locked up inside of my head
Is just to sing it over
Like the melody remembering the details
Like all the times when they had me working retail
And all the times where we got no love from females
But now we're getting boxes like an email
They wanna figure out how this little sprout came to blossom
How it takes so long to figure out I'm fucking awesome
You be on the internet but never came across him
Guess you weren't looking in the right place, the right place
Shout out to Elizabeth Smart
If you ain't livin' for today then you livin' tomorrow
And they recycling my style then claiming it's borrowed
I guess I'm helping the environment doing my part

[Chorus: Jared Evan]
I'm too young to die, Mama don't you cry for me
Just wait for me, wait for me
We can live our lives just like the other side
Isn't it meant to be, meant to be?

[Verse 2: Hoodie Allen]
Nice clothes, nice hair, nice outfit
Nice to finally meet you, I can tell you ain't about shit
And I'm a Leo so you know I'm tryin' to pounce it
Ask me where I'm livin' and I'm givin' the address of all the couches
At my friends' houses that I crashed at
And then she dipped on me, left me with a hashtag
A broke rapper from a Gap ad
But now I'm Indy 500 and I'm livin' on the fast track
So watch me as I pass back and jump up like NASDAQ
I know you couldn't imagine that
From the kid who was livin' in his backpack
Well I made a promise to my mama, I'mma be a better man
It took a couple months and I got a couple grand to show for it
I take the subway no chauffeurin'
I make 'em proud, baby go for it
Cause I be stayin' underground like I gophered it
If you afraid to be alone then get over it

[Chorus: Jared Evan]

[Bridge: Hoodie Allen]
I know you'll never think it's fair
But Marlie baby, don't compare
Cause it's too hard to relate to you lately
If the good die sooner than the bad ones
Then give me one reason not to have fun
I feel like we're falling away

[Chorus: Jared Evan]
