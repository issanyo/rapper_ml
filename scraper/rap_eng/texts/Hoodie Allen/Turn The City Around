[Intro]
Every nights the same
Every, every nights the same shit (3x)
The same shit, t-the same shit

[Hook]
I see the same faces dancing in the crowd
She ain't ever giving it all
And I ain't got it all (all!)
But I want it now (now, now!)
Lets turn the city around

[Verse 1]
Yeah, yeah Woe is me, all these tracks I'm going in
They call it poetry, I am Edgar owning it
So I just fly like ravens and you caged and alone
I'm done with kiddie games but you Raven Symone
So I'm saving the throne watch it when I storm through
And I took over the universe from my dorm room
Bet I stand out like a high school recruit
Y'all stand in when you learning to shoot
That means I'm earning my loot before the big leagues
Everybody biting me like Seigfried dig me

[Hook]

Because

[Hook 2]
Every nights the same
Every, every nights the same shit (3x)
Lets turn the city around

[Verse 2]
Now I move too quick, follow me like a school rubric
Cause I wanna shine like I'm Kubrick
And have the whole world say "damn you sick"
And you slip when you try to stand on steady ground
I am off into the future are you really ready now
So we stand in the waiting line
Never lose the place in time
They say it's the path to success
But if I get a chance to put your face in mine
Into space and a case of wine
We can fly where no one is left
And that'd be the best

[Hook]

[Hook 2]

[Bridge](3x)
Get down, get right, get over love
Let this music hit you from above

[Hook]

[Hook 2]

[Outro]
Let's turn the city around (2x)
