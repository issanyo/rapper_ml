[Hook: OCD: Moosh & Twist]
I ride for my clique
I get live with my clique
Go get high with my clique
Do or die for my clique
Said it's all that I know
Yeah, it's all that I know
Yeah, it's all that I know
And you can never tell me nothing
I ride for my clique
I get live with my clique
Go get high with my clique
Do or die for my clique
Said it's all that I know
Yeah, it's all that I know
Yeah, it's all that I know
And you can never tell me nothing

[Verse 1: Twist]
You already know just where I be dog, I ain't being cocky
But Philly what I'm repping, watch me check it like it's hockey
I ain't tryna get it twisted, if you get it then you got me
If you with it, cool, if not, I'll treat you like a Tamagotchi
I'mma let you down point, yeah, I never disappoint
Give me something I can I spit on, watch me rip it like a joint
I'm 'bout to take her out to dinner, guarantee I tip her
Little but we do it big, like I was a dipper
And these homies never crushin', guarantee they never bustin'
Dog, your flow be super weak, now go to sleep like Robitussin
I ain't tryna be that homie who could never make it happen
If you down let's get it crackin', make that paper keep it stackin'
Like I love the way it feel, when she break it down for real
What's the deal, flow is worth a mil
Trick, I'm 'bout to kill, keep it trill
That's the way I roll, that's the way I go
That's for 'sho, that's the way I flow
Every day you know...

[Verse 2: Moosh]
I'm like one time for my day-ones, man, who the hell gon' stop us?
Came up from that dark side, where they ride around with them choppers
Stay clear of them gold diggers, trying to get a piece of that lobster
Man, I be whipping it so hard, gotta watch out for them coppers
But we just bringing Philly back, it's just me and Twizzy Mack
Swear to God I'm on a roll, you gon' have to willy that
Hear about the kids, we just scare 'em out of gigs
It's about damn time that they verify the kids
Man, I'm feeling stupid homie, I might do the money dance
I flew to Vegas and I woke up at the bunny ranch
Baby, you too official, I'm tryna see it with you
You know they call me Q, be my Moesha Mitchell
I'm like pay what you owe me, I don't play with you phonies
I got enough friends, I don't bet with you homie
You ain't talking 'bout profit, my hands stuck in my wallet
It's all good, my slate clean, don't worry 'bout it, I got it

[Verse 3: Hoodie Allen]
Running with teams up and out of your league
Looking like Leaf, Ryan, you trying but never achieve
Fuck it, I'm cutting down everything that you aspire to be
People be talking 'bout all of your raps and they falling asleep, capital Z
Put on my track and I'm burning 'em down, shout to love letters fired to me
Bank account is like millions, living life with some villains
Pulling up in that stolen car, scaring all the civilians
Rich bitches be pissed at us, bad bitches be missing us
I'm out here with that Moosh & Twist, these other rappers just kids to us
So zip it up, I ain't talking 'bout it, 'less I live that
Big bitches on thin ice, yeah homie my shit crack
Bend over then get slapped, 'bout to teach a lesson
Every time I touch the beat, they said "oh god" like it's a blessin'
Watch me take your girl, I'm just messin'
Watch me take your job, I'm just messin'
I got these old women screaming my name at the top of they lungs, like they might be pubescent
I got your attention, and I ain't gonna drop it
The more that you listen, the more that I profit
So I'mma keep ripping, and y'all can keep floppin'
I'm rap's Robert Griffin, so who gonna stop 'em?
