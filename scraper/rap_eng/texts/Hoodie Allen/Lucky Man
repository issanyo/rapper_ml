[Spoken Intro]
[Hook]
Take a sip of my drink fuck it take the bottle
Dated grad school chicks and I've dated models
I'm a lucky man maybe I should play the lotto
But they don't, they don't, they don't wanna swallow their pride
I ain't tryin' to go home that's the fuckin' motto
And I don't wanna fall in love with another model
So baby what you got inside yo water bottle
But they don't, they don't, they don't wanna ruin the surprise

[Verse 1]
Yeah, so now she wanna hear my new song
I give it to her before right before I put my moves on
I'm in that two door coup√© me and Sufjan
Tell 'em I don't even need a deal like group on
Cause all she ever wanted was that real shit
I'm 5'9 but I'm feeling like I'm real big
On top of the clouds on the buildings
Cut a little class cause my life is like a field trip
Where we stayin' tonight? Am I playing it right?
And can I knock it out of the park like late in the 9th
Cause everyone in the crowd loves a comeback
So name a city that I'm in and I run that
It's all trickery play the Hickory Dickory
Every chick that be into me try to Jeremy Lin with me
I pull him off the bench, I give them all a shot
One minute they on a roll, the next minute they not

And I don't wanna fall in love with another model

[Verse 2]
I been up, like two and a half days
Homie we All American U to the SA
My family call me Hoodie we cool with the last name
I be takin' down my enemy, shoot 'em like Max Payne
Playin' video games, no Lana Del Rey
I met a chick with big lips and I wanted to stay
But most of the pretty women in here are missing their hearts
They be lookin' for world peace but they end up with Art
Testing, testing, one, two, three here's the microphone
I kick it with the Hoodie Mob, and now I feel like Al Capone
But you the biggest drama queen, fine you won the trophy
Cause the only time you like genuine is on the pony
I hit the gold mine, I'm trying to whore this
If she looks like Halle Berry I'll give her that swordfish
And we drinkin' till these women be hittin' the floor bitch
But I'm nicer in the morning I hit up the florist
