You've been acting awful tough lately
Smoking a lot of cigarettes lately
But inside your just a little baby oh

(Drop it)

Its okay to say you got a weak spot
(Its Hoodie Allen)
You don't always have to be on top
(what up marina)
Better to be hated (What up Marina)
Than loved,loved,loved,for what your not

They tellin me to take the safe route
Well this is the detour
Hoodie baby you aint seen a kid like this before him
Late night shooin for the moon like warren
the hits come out as soon as you hit recordin

Born in america chevy,and ford
But these Greek ladys lovin me they sayin he's foreign
Floored him

Glued the crowd down by there boot strap
Came up on the scene so quick you think we was a news cast

Well news flash, i could see right through that
People try to hide whats on there mind like a dew rag

never would I do that im a real fuckin hustler
You bein in the backround makin noise like a muffler

But if it dosen't kill me it makes me tougher
And that's a message that i pass on to my brother

You never really gonna make a difference till you suffer but we past that
now its time to smash that
Thunder

You've been acting awful tough lately
smoking a lot of cigarettes lately
but inside your just a little baby oh

Its ok to say you got a weak spot
You dont always have to be on top
better to be hated
Than loved, loved, loved, for what your not

Lately i have been stayin' on my grind like a skate board
I got some rocket power now so lets take off

we goin' hard over these beats y'all just stay soft
I don't even feel the need to say pause

Cause you a cheat to the system how you came and Bernie Madoff

I'm a firm believer that the hard work pays off
The playoffs, I treat them like Mora did
That means I'm working with a little to get more of it

And anybody who doubted us we ignoring it
I'm on a different mission
An exhibition no scoring it

So if we more legit they treat us like a compound
Yeah they wanna brake us down, never gonna stop now

Cause being scared will only eat you like a cop out
Life's a haunted house and I'm ready to pop out

And shout out to Marina for these pop sounds
I know you really love me but let's let this chorus drop now

You've been acting awful tough lately
Smoking a lot of cigarettes lately
But inside, you're just a little baby

It's okay to say you've got a weak spot
You don't always have to be on top
Better to be hated
Than love, love, loved for what you're not

Say slow up,
Sometimes I'm just feelin' like a robot
Sittin round, hoping that you'll show up
But you know what, you know what

Slow up,
Sometimes I'm just feelin' like a robot
Sittin round, hoping that you'll show up
But you know what, you know what

You've been acting awful tough lately
Smoking a lot of cigarettes lately
But inside, you're just a little baby

It's okay to say you've got a weak spot
You don't always have to be on top
Better to be hated
Than love, love, loved for what you're not
