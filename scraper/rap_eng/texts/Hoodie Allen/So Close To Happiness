[Intro]
(Woah oh, yeah yeah)
Check it yo

[Verse 1]
I think I’ll be a father one day soon
I must admit it
I’ll be the type of dad to give you hugs and lots of spinach
I take vacations but I tell my wife
I’m gone on business
She probably thinking I screwed around with my new assistant
One day our kids will sit us down and ask us how we met
Well I liked her pic on Instagram one day she hit me back
Said I was cute and shit and didn’t love me for my money
Apologize, I was a dickhead in my early twenties
Back in the day your daddy was a rapper
Riding ‘round on tour-busses getting bitches after
Said I needed space, could have sworn I went to NASA
Then I met your mom it was happy ever after
Yeah, okay those days were super crazy
Would have done those shows for free
But won’t complain that you would pay me
Driving around my old neighborhood in a new Mercedes
It won't be too long ‘til they ask me “what you doing lately?”

[Hook]
I know  you think you need that
We don’t wanna believe that
We can make it to the top
We’re so close to happiness
So close to happiness
Big house, don’t really need that
Real love, I’m tryna keep that
Please don’t give up what we got
We’re so close to happiness
So close to happiness

[Verse 2]
Ayo, where the fuck did time go?
I used it wisely, that’s why I will never rhyme slow
I’m in hotels such much that I feel like the Bible
I see so many naked pictures on my iPhone
Oh it’s like a slideshow
Oh my gosh my mind’s blown
It get me deeper than a pizza in Chicago
Been on so many planes I can’t explain my timezone
A middle seat in Delta sorta feels like my home
This is all that I know
Make beats, write songs, hope that shit go viral
Only motivation was to blow it up like pyro
Now that I’m so close to reaching my goals
Every step I take is like a spiral, self destructive, I know
That’s just how I feel, I’m sorry if I’m not supposed to keep it real
I guess I’m scared if I accomplish all my dreams the only thing left
Will be to talk about me and I don’t wanna do that

[Hook]
I know  you think you need that
We don’t wanna believe that
We can make it to the top
We’re so close to happiness
So close to happiness
Big house, don’t really need that
Real love, I’m tryna keep that
Please don’t give up what we got
We’re so close to happiness
So close to happiness

[Post-Hook 1]
Woah-oh-oh
Woah-oh-oh
Woah-oh-oh
Woah-oh-oh


[Bridge]
And I just wanna find someone to believe in
I’m so close
I don’t wanna let you go, why you leaving?
I don’t know
I tend to fuck up all the special things
So don’t let it go away
I’m telling you that I’m so close to happiness
I’m so close to having it, having it
And I wanna let you know
You can be part of it
Cause I’m so close to happiness

[Post-Hook 2]
Yeah baby like
Woah-oh-oh
Woah-oh-oh
Yeah baby like
Woah-oh-oh
Woah-oh-oh

[Outro]
And I want to let you know
You can be part of it
Cause I’m so close to happiness
