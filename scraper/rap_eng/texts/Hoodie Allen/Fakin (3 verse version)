[Hook]
Why you always fakin' on the net though?
Why you always flexing for the timeline?
Fakin', fakin', fakin'
Where your friends go?
Why you taking pictures of me all night?
But I'm not that nice of a dude
I might have to be rude
Why you always begging me for rent though?
Why you, why you, why, why you fakin' fakin'?

[Verse 1]
Why you always, why you always fucking on me?
Just let go me
I'm with my homies, and you don't know me
We ain't that close, bitch we ain't that close
You should, you should already know
A-already know
You came into my party, asking for a plus-three
I'm like "are your friends bad?"
She replied "just trust me"
Feeling kinda Irish, I'm always getting lucky
So many girls call me daddy, I should fight for custody
My life like The Oscars, critics say it's must see
All my haters love me, that's why they never bug me
Your girl is probably going home with me 'cause you ugly
I'mma take her phone so she don't got no pictures of me -
Paparazzi

I might have to be rude
Why you always begging me for rent though?
Why you, why you, why, why you fakin', fakin'?

[Verse 2]
Why you always fakin'?
You must have been mistaken
I look like I'm a movie star, bitch I'm Kevin Bacon
I need more separation, so get these people off this
And I don't lead the office without seven figure offers
Oh you wanna, Oh you wanna be my baby tonight
Oh you wanna, Oh you wanna come on this flight
Oh you wanna, Oh you wanna tell your friends what I'm like
Oh you wanna, Oh you wanna I'm really all about it, nah

Why you, why you, why, why you fakin', fakin'?

[Verse 3]
Fakin' and bakin'
I'm done with the hand shaking
Dap it up on me we cool
Everything negative, you're way too late again
Girls in they get in my pool
Fuck what you saying, I might be Jamaican
They tell me I'm some kind of jerk
Drop the beat I go berzerk
Homie I'm puttin' in work
Got in my back again, still Billy Madison
Still eating lunch and dessert
People keep talking, their guns will be floppin'
I'm ignoring every word
Painting, I'm painting, I'm painting the picture
They tryin' to tell me what it's worth
I swear that I might be the dopest motherfucker off of this planet, on Earth
I did it since birth, I tell you my plans
It ain't no secret that I've been the man
I am just saying this shit's to be saying it
I am just saying it 'cause I c-can, 'cause I c-can
I'll even stutter
These bitches don't know you, they don't even bother
'Cause my bigget fan is also your mother
I swear they be playing this every summer, so

Why you always fakin' on the net though?

Why you, why you, why, why you fakin', fakin'?

[Outro]
Fakin', Fakin'
Fakin', Fakin'
Fakin', Fakin'
