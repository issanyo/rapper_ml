[Intro]
We don't gotta work it out
Cause no one gonna tell you where to find me
When you, you come looking for me
Cause I'll be walking out the door before you know it
And you better believe

[Verse 1]
Kick it with that new girl, eatin my Chipotle
Yeah we getting married, I don't care what all them hoes say
Rap Zac Efron, all we do is roleplay
Screaming "Dios Mio", yeah that must be cause I'm ol√©
All that and a bag of chips, pass the guacamole
We just getting started babe imagine what I don't say
Every conversation is a chance for me to outwit
Do you feel that little spark, outlet, ow shit
So I don't need the press, I don't want a interview
I'm trynna lay you down, you just tryna Witherspoon
Take you somewhere private so that I can get a interview
With a vampire thats True Blood up in the room
So have you heard the gossip girl?
I've been doin it since Mickey Ryan Gosling girl
I read a text that you away, come find me
She said the party here is getting Blake, Lively

[Hook]
I don't know but I been told
The world outside is, oh so cold (So Cold!)
Late at night when you're alone
Do you think about me now that I'm gone?
When I'm on the road I often dream
And think of you (You know I'm thinking of you)
Girl, I hope that you do too

[Verse 2]
Shouts to Roger Ebert, Shouts to Emma Roberts
I think that you're a cutie, but I'd rather have you aunt first
Take you to the movies, I can't wait until your Starburst
Put me in a suit and a pair of dirty converse
I'm flyer than a mothafucka, pretty with her hair up
Bitches wanna play the field, so I just call them Airbud
All these rappers talk inside the box like an air duct
And I can switch it up and sing, go and get your hands up
Every speaker blares, it's a witch project
You gone drop up on the people like a witch project
I be doing it for free until I'm rich, God Bless
Ask me how that works and I admit, it's complex
Well, not like the magazine, ok well actually
I'm Lindsay Lohan cause I swear I'm only acting mean
Pay my dues and slap the beat, for everyone responsible
Swag coming out of my fucking nostrils, hostile

[Hook]

[Bridge]
I-been-all-A-lone
They can't bring me down
I'm-waiting-by-the-phone
Won't you take me out
I-know-when-I-am-wrong
So I say it now
Hey, I wrote this song for an actress
I wrote this song for an actress

[Hook]

[Outro]
