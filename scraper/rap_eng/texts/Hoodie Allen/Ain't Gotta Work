[Verse 1]
I got Michael Clark Duncan on my speed dial
You ain't impressed girl? He from Green Mile
Buying things I couldn't afford, let me keep mine
Rich kids never payed for clothes, that's "free" style
Said "I'll give you the world", so what you need kid
Siamese like where the fuck do I begin?
It's kind of funny, we all chasing the money tree
Son of a bitch, cause bitches want to have sons of me
Is it right girl? Is it sex trade?
White girls, push that white girl to get paid
And do you blame 'em when you meet someone who's famous
On the internet, for saying all the things that you've been saying
Man I do it for the principle, yeah you know that "holy crap"
Sometimes I feel like I'm the only one who holds me back
It's fictitious, I'm here with some big wishes
But I'm really ain't sick, please don't tell Kobe that

[Hook]
Here we come, on our way
We don't got no job today
We don't want one any way
Here we come, on our way
We don't got no job today
We don't want one any way

[Verse 2]
Everyone's a critic, but no one listens to their advice
Staring like I'm Angelina Jolie in a pair of tights
Foreign kids, and yoga pants, but she use to go-go dance
Sample my parents favorite record, Like I know that band
I make 'em real proud, I make 'em hold their hands
Speak a little Spanish, but how do you say Gold in France
Le or, put everything on the tour bus
On deck, circle, but I'm waiting 'til you're up
And I've been skipping out on life a bit
You've been trying to come between us like we hyphened it
Promise that I'ma listen to everything that you said, but
I'm busy making these hits, and you're busy making your bed
So, sleep on it, we on it
I got a couch, no Chappelle, put your feet on it
Gave me a little buzz in the oven, now I'm a honey bee
But no one's gonna like you when you're twenty three

[Hook]
Here we come, on our way
We don't got no job today
We don't want one any way
Here we come, on our way
We don't got no job today
We don't want one any way

[Bridge]
This is for my friends that I lose
If I don't grow up, I won't grow up now
This is for my friends that I lose
If I don't grow up, I won't grow up now
This is for my friends that I lose
If I don't grow up, I won't grow up now
This is for my friends that I lose
If I don't grow up, I won't grow up now

[Hook]
Here we come, on our way
We don't got no job today
We don't want one any way
Here we come, on our way
We don't got no job today
We don't want one any way
