[Hook]
Shit's over now, we can't work it out
If you're right there, chillin' in the friend Zone
And I can't help you if you're frontin' too
You know I can't just live without you

[Verse 1]
You've been the person that's been stressing my life quick
Cause I'm not trying to be the other man like a sidekick
No Butch Cassidy, y'all just have to be
Gettin' in line for the Masterpiece
And I never claimed to be your Romeo
But maybe I'm Master P, that's how it has to be
Y'all can wait after me, came to the buffet starving
Y'all ain't really ready but I'm Reggie at the Garden
Cause I've been thinking you're the future girl I mess with
Call her Judy Jetson, let's split
Somewhere, where our chemistry is tested, SAT's
I be giving her my pen she's like S-A-please, Geez
And that's just exactly how a fan's made
Callin' all the time in between your tan breaks
And now we're friends sharing pancakes
And you tryna to ask for the digits of my band mates

[Hook 2]
And I don't wanna talk no more
Cause I heard that friends don't score
Stuck in the zone that I've been before
And you don't look at me just like I do (2x)

Do you, what the fuck I gotta do?
She don't look at me just like I do (2x)

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
I'm tired of sitting on the side like a red shirt
Cause when it comes to women, I be falling head first
That means my head hurts, so Trent Edwards
I be looking at you, twisting every single said word
And your friend said you leaving in the same cab
Damn, I really hate your friend bad
Every compliment, I meant that, true
So I'm thinking that I can't just live without
You wearing glasses but you got the perfect vision
I'm a jerk, admit it, but I swear I'm worth the visit
Nervous, but I'm living, means I'm always taking chances
How else am I supposed to get you pants-less
No E-Z pass, I couldn't advance and
I don't think we're really there anymore like Kansas
Dancing with the floor, showing everybody that you're worth
I got you sixth string but I couldn't get a first kiss

[Hook 2]

I just can't live without you
