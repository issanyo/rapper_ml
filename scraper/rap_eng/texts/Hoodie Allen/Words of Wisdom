Chorus:
And she spoke words that would melt in your hand (sophisticated)
She spoke words of wisdom (I'm glad we made it)

Verse 1:
I had a vision of us winning now it's gone again
Got the world on my legs Landon Donovan
Shit ain't always what it seems like Juwanna Mann
Worst case I'll be back in 4 years just to run again
Now I be the running man, I deliver goods, don't cater
This shit's hot, someone turn up the AC Slater
If not, then I burn up these tapes like paper
But for life decisions I needed tips like waiters
Got Clipse I waited and they both gave me props
Cleaned up the arena like they both gave me mops
Venus and Serena how we floating these lobs
And stay way over your dome till the thrones what we got
But they tell me keep a level head just in case we blow
I be peeping levels ahead like a cheat code
And once you got it, they can't take it back repo
Back to the future baby, we don't need roads, we go

Chorus:
And she spoke words that would melt in your hand
And she spoke words of wisdom

Verse 2:
These people feeding me lines, they think I'm Kate Moss
I'm all about the promotion until I'm made boss
Got flow like bros that try to play lacrosse
And now my name is stuck in all your throats like a late cough
So pardon me I'm hardly congested
Fans are so down, they Dow Jones investments
But we the blue chip, give you that new shit
Ship is never sinking we avoiding all the loose lips
Came out of my cage now they want to baby proof this
I do it for the babes but I swear I'm never ruthless
Cuz that's small ball, swinging through the screw pitch
Sometimes I gotta watch my mouth like a toothpick
They ask "who's this?" Fam I never lack that
RJF been holding all these tracks like a backpack
I hit 21 now, blackjack
Looking to my future, homie swear I'll never backtrack

Chorus:

Outro:
Let me go and I might just fall
Saying my cause just might be lost
So I know that if I stay tall
The words that I need can't write me off (x4)
Ill be here for forever man
