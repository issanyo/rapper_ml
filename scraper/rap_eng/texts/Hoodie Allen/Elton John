[Intro]
Ooh, Lil Phag
Ooh, Dr Woke
Ooh
It's the doctor

[Chorus: Lil Phag]
Gone off Patron
Got a hundred on my arm
With my clout goggles on
Bitch, I feel like Elton John
Elton John, Elton John
El-Elton John, Elton John
Elton John, Elton John
El-Elton John, Elton John

[Verse 1: Lil Phag]
Moving them keys but I ain't talking piano
Stay in a mansion but came from a bando
Open the suicide doors of the Lambo
Circle is small, don't fuck with a rando
Light up a blunt and get lit like a candle
Platinum plaques going up on the mantle
Gucci stripes all the way down to my sandals
Sippin' tequila right out of the handle
Used to live out in the D (ooh)
Broke so I had to sell E (yeah)
Now your bitch effin' with me (ooh)
'Cause she know Phag is a G (true)
Catch me all over the news (ooh)
TMZ leakin' my nudes (damn)
Twitter be startin' up feuds
Brr, ooh, Lil Phag

[Chorus: Lil Phag & Dr Woke]
Gone off Patron
Got a hundred on my arm
With my clout goggles on
Bitch, I feel like Elton John
Elton John, Elton John
El-Elton John, Elton John
Elton John, Elton John
El-Elton John, Elton John (it's the Doc)

[Verse 2: Dr Woke]
Off a bean and I think I'm meltin'
To the moon, rock your man like Elton
Blastin' off soon as I'm exhalin'
In the clouds, so high I'm sailin'
Flyer than Harry Potter
JK, I'm rollin' harder
Sippin' on pH water
D Woke might fuck your daughter
I'm woke

[Chorus: Lil Phag]
Gone off Patron
Got a hundred on my arm
With my clout goggles on
Bitch, I feel like Elton John
Elton John, Elton John
El-Elton John, Elton John
Elton John, Elton John
El-Elton John, Elton John

[Verse 3: Hoodie Allen]
Yeah
Hoodie came in with a flow so cold y'all know by comparison y'all shit's wack
I don't really fuck with politics but I got nothing but respect for my president Lil Phag
I got girls in all states (huh)
Tryna tattoo my name (tat)
And I'm a good Jewish boy (hoo)
Bitch, I cannot relate (ugh)
This is the life of a rapper
Stay in your lane, you a passenger
I worked with Chance before Acid Rap
The chance of you working with Chanceâ€”
You must be on acid, bruh
I run your pockets, you better get faster
Feel like the rocket man, bitch, I'm so NASA
All of you YouTubers tryna be rappers
You ain't Lil Phag, bitch, I'm breakin' your cameras

[Chorus: Lil Phag]
Gone off Patron
Got a hundred on my arm
With my clout goggles on
Bitch, I feel like Elton John
Elton John, Elton John
El-Elton John, Elton John
Elton John, Elton John
El-Elton John, Elton John
