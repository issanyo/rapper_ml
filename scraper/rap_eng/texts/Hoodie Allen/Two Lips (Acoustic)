[Verse 1]
Sneakin' out my bed at night
I tell her, "turn the lights down low"
I'm tryin' to figure out my mind
She always wonder where I go
Oh, making good music
Comin' home with a pocket full of tulips
You tryna to point an arrow at me like Cupid
I'm tryna to end up in that pussy like two lips

[Pre-Chorus]
But, she wanna off my head
Wanna off my head
Can we both forget?
Baby, I don't know
Want me more, or less?
Want me more, or less?
Is it all for sex?
Baby, I hope so

[Hook]
So, tell me what you want, what you really really want
I ain't got time, if you think that you in love with me
So tell me what you want from me, oh
And I ain't got time, if you really wanna fuck
You're bitchin' all the time that you "never get enough from me"
So tell me what you want from me, oh oh

[Verse 2]
Sittin' in the hotel lobby
You never get me off my phone
Shoot me like a paparazzi
You show up, then I got to go
Make good music
Everybody that I'm meetin' is a doofus
They tryna point an arrow at me like Cupid
I'm tryna end up in that pussy like two lips

[Pre-Chorus]
She wanna off my head
Wanna off my head, my head
Can we both forget?
Baby, I don't know
Want me more, or less?
Want me more, or less, or less?
Is it all for sex?
Baby, I hope so
Well, I hope

[Hook]
You tell me what you want, what you really really want
I ain't got time, if you think that you in love with me
So tell me what you want from me, oh
And I ain't got time, if you really wanna fuck
You're bitchin' all the time that you "never get enough from me"
So tell me what you want from me, oh oh

[Hook from Casanova]
Give me some bad advice
I hate when you ask me over
You drunk off a glass of wine
No wonder I'm actin' sober
So, cut me out of your life
And leave me like class is over
But, when the day goes, and the night comes
I'll still be your Casanova

[Hook]
So, tell me what you want, what you really really want
I ain't got time, if you think that you in love with me
So tell me what you want from me, oh
And I ain't got time, if you really wanna fuck
You're bitchin' all the time that you "never get enough from me"
So tell me what you want from me, oh oh

[Hook from Casanova]
Give me some bad advice
I hate when you ask me over (ask me over)
You drunk off a glass of wine
No wonder I'm actin' sober (actin' sober)
So, cut me out of your life
And leave me like class is over
But, when the day goes, and the night comes
I'll still be your Casanova
