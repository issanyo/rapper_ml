[Verse 1: Hoodie Allen]
I been walking 'round like I don't give a fuck, fuck, fuck
And it's probably for the better baby
I don't talk too much, I never speak enough, enough, enough
I just keep my secrets hidden
Tell me lies, tell me lies
Oh you graduated, with a three point five GPA in communications
And you in LA for the day, this is your vacation
Brought your friends into my crib
But you're the only one that's staying
Well that's me, just being a little cocky
We can do it on the stairs like I'm Rocky
I could prepare you a three course meal but it's not me
I rather eat her out like Hibachi
So stop the conversay, it's like a holiday
The way you bless me girl, that's Godly

[Hook: Blackbear]
So come over tonight, ain't nobody home
We can fuck anywhere, you already know
So keep on the lights, we got nothing to hide
This ain't no surprise party
We could start on the bed, end up on the floor
Fuck in every room, girl, I'll give you a tour
This ain't no surprise party
Girl, and you don't need no invitation
Woah, oh yeah (and this ain't not surprise party)
This ain't no surprise party
Girl, you don't need no invitation

[Verse 2: Hoodie Allen]
Yo I woke up feeling like my life was excellent
She jumped on top of me like "Let's have sex again"
This ain't no investigation, I don't even question it
I'm the type to inspire your girl to get undressed again
Take it off, take it off, we can make some offspring
We don't sleep, we just fuck, I'mma need some coffee
Your boy getting busy with a Sidney in Sydney
And she going down under, yeah, she treat me like an Aussie
And she asking if I'm ready for commitment
Tom Cruise I ain't tryna have a kid, man
Tie your shoes cause baby I think you're trippin'
Maybe you don't go the vision but I'm seeing other women
Aw, I'm tryna blow some steam not my self-esteem
Ask me: "Do you see yourself in me?"
Hah, obviously

[Hook: Blackbear]
So come over tonight, ain't nobody home
We can fuck anywhere, you already know
So keep on the lights, we got nothing to hide
This ain't no surprise party
We could start on the bed, end up on the floor
Fuck in every room, girl, I'll give you a tour
This ain't no surprise party
Girl, and you don't need no invitation
Woah, oh yeah (and this ain't not surprise party)
This ain't no surprise party
Girl, you don't need no invitation
