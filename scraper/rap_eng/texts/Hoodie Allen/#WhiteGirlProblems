[Intro]
Place to rest when you get tired
(I got so many bills to pay)
When your own address is expired
(I tweet way too much)
Hell this is my fifth take of this intro
My dad likes to call that life
But I like to call that

[Verse 1]
White girl problems, met her back in autumn
Every gift I try to get her, she already got 'em
Messing with the TA, wonder what she taught him
Work her way down, literally to the bottom
Where are all my best friends, how can I ignore them
Never gonna text them, I am too important
Look at what my dad bought, yeah it was imported
He took a second loan cause our family can't afford it, nice guy
Bound to finish last if it's a sport
Call her Cee-Lo cause she crazy and her arms are kinda short
Got a traffic ticket once, but she didn't go to court
And she interrupts my sessions every time that I record
So I tell her I got so much shit up on my plate, it's a buffet
Now we out in paris and these women look like Muzzy
Superficial she just need a Combs like puffy
You don't need to go but I think you need to trust me

[Hook]
Come take a drink with me forget all you know
You'll pay tuition I'll just live on the flo'
I think you fly, but your friend's ugly fo sho
Well, come take a drink with me forget to enroll

[Verse 2]
White girl problems, met her at a concert
Think it was Tiesto, already forgot it
Who am I to blame her? She was so obnoxious
Got a little taste of your lips, it was toxic
We should keep in contact, okay, that is nonsense
Sure I'll take your email, tell me where to jot it
Got a pen and pencil on me at all times cause I rhyme
Now I'm kinda feeling genius that I brought it
Switchup, not Black Eyed peas but I wish I was richer
Finally graduated, she majored in being mixed up
Recognize you from T.V., Yo can we please take a picture?
I call you Mary-Kate cause I can't really tell the difference
It beats me, addicted to pills and Avicii
The Hills used to be cool, what happened to LC
Parents moving to Florida so who's left to help me
I can't but I'll write about you on my LP

[Hook]
Come take a drink with me forget all you know
You'll pay tuition I'll just live on the floor
I think you fly but your friend's ugly fo sho
Well, come take a drink with me, forget to enroll

[Bridge]
