[Verse]
You never make it simple, but I'm down for the challenge
I've been caught up in the middle
Tryna find a balance and I should have seen it coming
When you turn into a savage, but you got something special
All the other girls are average

[Pre-Chorus]
And I still got my eyes on you, after all this shit you put me through
And I know I never say I do, but I like wasting my time on you

[Chorus]
I like, wasting all my time, wasting, wasting all my time
Wasting all my time on you
I like, wasting all my time, wasting, wasting all my time
Wasting all my time on you
(You're a bad bitch, know I gotta have it)

[Verse]
Only have a couple minutes, turn to hours by the time we finished
And I know I should have kept my distance, but I didn't now you got me trippin'

[Pre-Chorus]
And I still got my eyes on you, after all this shit you put me through
And I know I never say I do, but I like wasting my time on you

[Chorus]
I like, wasting all my time, wasting, wasting all my time
Wasting all my time on you
I like, wasting all my time, wasting, wasting all my time
Wasting all my time on you

[Verse]
Yo, I fell in love when we first met, not a lot of moments I would regret
And I know this shit is bittersweet, we both know this ain't meant to be
'Cause we live two different lives, and I'm always on the other side
The only thing that money couldn't buy, was just a little more time

[Pre-Chorus]
But I still got my eyes on you, after all this shit you put me through
And I know I never say I do, but I like wasting my time on you

[Chorus]
I like, wasting all my time, wasting, wasting all my time
Wasting all my time on you
I like, wasting all my time, wasting, wasting all my time
Wasting all my time on you
