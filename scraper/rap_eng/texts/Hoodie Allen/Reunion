[Hook]
Class lined up, girls lined up, guys lined up
I said I dropped the mixtape and it sounded like an album
Dropped the mixtape and it sounded like an album

[Verse 1]
Girls up in the front row
Let me see your hands up
They be rocking crew cuts
I ain't talking 'bout no hair cut
They'd rather pull my pants off
So I tell them 'go commando'
She calling me a god
Oh father, that's Marlon Brando
These girls hit you like catfish
Girls hit me like Katniss
They fall in love with this rap shit
And I go to bed when I tap this
Woo, that's madness
Trick, I don't know no magic
But everything I do is crack
Call my album chapped lips
Shhh, you Chaplin
Don't speak when I'm rappin'
You hang around like fashion
But I look good, DatPiff
I'm 'bout to get it that big
Mobb Deep like Havoc
You so out of this world
I don't even know the planets

[Hook]
I said I been around the globe for a century
And I'mma get to you eventually
Cause I'mma take you where you're meant to be
Where you're meant to be, where you're meant to be
Is right next to me, so don't go in a hurry
You already know, don't you worry
I'mma take you where you're meant to be
Where you're meant to be, where you're meant to be
Is right next to me, the reunion

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Girls that fuck with Lupe
Girls that look like Lana
Come back to the telly
And take shots at the Ramada
I'm Morrison like in Jimmy
You Morrisette like Alana
That make us the perfect couple
Let's make a couple Madonnas
Got no problem with coppers
'Less they doin' their job
I'm way too pretty for prison
I'm beggin' you, oh your Honor
Just let me play my position
Chris Paul you could never guard us
Other rappers are sweatin'
I tell them to hit the sauna
Pointin' in my reflection
But I don't need protection
Got a gang of wild bitches
They lovin' my whole inflection
Only move in one direction
No Harry, no Niall
I just gon' bury your style
You could get used to being rejected

[Hook]

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Girls who love to study
Girls with bad attendance
Both after my money
And they only tryna spend it
Said your favorite rapper's who?
I don't even get offended
We ain't on the same page
Jack Donaghy to your Kenneth
Okay well let's pretend it
I'm ballin' like Andy Pettitte
If I keep it independent
I'm 'bout to cop me a pennant
And I only play fair
These bitches is Roger Clemens
You cheat to get ahead
You'll probably lose it in the end
