[Intro]
Happy camper, happy camper
Happy camper, oh

[Verse 1]
Yo, life can be super happy, life can be super sad
I'm trying super hard to separate the good and the bad
I'll go back to my future just to get to my past
But knowing me, my DeLorean would probably crash
Sometimes I get in a taxi when I ain't got no cash
Worry if my credit card don't work, then I might have to dash
Have the cab driver chase me 20 blocks down 7th Ave
And if he catching up to me, I know he'll wanna kick my ass
Damn, that's one hell of an imagination
Even worse than talking to these girls, I get infatuated
Send a text and it go green, wonder what that fucking mean
Like did it send, has it been seen?
Why ain't she writing back to me?
Probably chatting with some other guys and I feel jealousy
Two days later, she write back, like S-R-Y, I fell asleep
I think I'll be alone forever, maybe I'll live with my parents
That way I could eat the food and never feel embarrassed cause

[Hook]
Sometimes I let my ego get the best of me
Sometimes I wonder why my stress is stressing me
Sometimes I lay awake and I can't go to sleep
This is my introduction to anxiety
Sometimes I need someone to take control of me
Sometimes I let my demons get ahold me
Sometimes I think that shit ain't what it used to be
This is my introduction to anxiety

[Verse 2]
Okay class, settle down, this is your teacher talking
I got the girls in the OC flipping like Mischa Barton
The only time I socialize is at a pizza party
Usually I see a party, overthink and keep on walking
Cause what if the friends I came with leave me with a bunch of strangers?
Standing all alone, I won't have no one to play drinking games with
And now I'm semi-famous, all they want's a selfie with me
Or several shots of whiskey to test my masculinity
And see how we compare or have a story for their friends
But I still feel like just some fucking guy so none of it makes sense
I don't need attention, I need an intervention
From the internet like I got sent home from a school suspension
Staring at my ceiling and I'm trying to make sense of it
Asking no one in particular, "Is this the best it gets?"
Swear to God, I hope it's not
Also know I shouldn't swear
Used to give a thousand fucks but nowadays I just don't care cause

[Hook]
Sometimes I let my ego get the best of me
Sometimes I wonder why my stress is stressing me
Sometimes I lay awake and I can't go to sleep
This is my introduction to anxiety
Sometimes I need someone to take control of me
Sometimes I let my demons get ahold me
Sometimes I think that shit ain't what it used to be
This is my introduction to anxiety

[Outro]
This is my introduction, oh
And we back
This is my introduction, oh
Oh, I'll give it to you, no interruption
You know, like the song?
You've probably, you've heard that one, right?
Huu, uh uh ah ah
