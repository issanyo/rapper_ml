[Verse 1]
Yeah, okay, the man who showed me how to fight
The same one who took the training wheels off of my bike
Then when I swerved and almost crashed into the neighbor's car
You screamed so loud at me that I fell over the handle bars
And I was scared to make you mad
You were scared that God was 'bout to take away, like, everything you had
What's weird, that certain memories you never forget
I mean, especially the ones that made you upset
Course you know those times we both would regret
When you and mom were fighting, I would go and bury my head
And with a pillow case on it, I could maybe pretend
I'd make it all go away
But after, the only thing that's broken was plates
I know I made my mistakes, I didn't always behave
Slipping out of the house and lying straight to your face
That shit was never okay
The least I'll do is show you respect
But I can never pay back the debt

[Chorus]
When you get down, someone's gonna steal your crown
But you'll always be a king to me, and a family
Cause you showed me how, showed me how to be a man
And always had a plan for me, a family

[Verse 2]
And when my little brother came, he told me you always keep him safe
Cause ain't no one closer in the world that you could replace
So that there will be a day when it's just you and him alone
You need to know that I can treat him okay
Don't wanna think about things in that way
But just know that I understand it
It's me and him against the fucking planet
Playing Madden, I let him be his own man
Up in college, even when my music shit start expanding
I know you're proud to be a parent
Yeah, we talk a lot, that shit apparent
Sometimes it's all good, sometimes it's about Taryn
Either way, you listen to my shit
Always lend a ear for me
Said you work two jobs, 365 a year for me
Now I'm growing up and that shit became so clear to me
Told me that the only thing in life I need to fear is me
Well, the least I'll do is show you respect
But I can never pay back the debt

[Chorus]
When you get down, someone's gonna steal your crown
But you'll always be a king to me, and a family
Cause you showed me how, showed me how to be a man
And always had a plan for me, a family

[Bridge]
When you get down, I'm gon' lift you up right now
When you get down, I'm gon' lift you up right now
When you get down, I'm gon' lift you up right now
When you get down, it's still gon' be the same

[Chorus]
When you get down, someone's gonna steal your crown
But you'll always be a king to me, and a family
Cause you showed me how, showed me how to be a man
And always had a plan for me, a family
When you get down, someone's gonna steal your crown
But you'll always be a king to me, and a family
Cause you showed me how, showed me how to be a man
And always had a plan for me, a family
