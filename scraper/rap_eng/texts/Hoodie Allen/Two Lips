[Intro]
Come on, come on, come on, come come on

[Verse 1]
Sneaking out my bed at night
Tell her, turn the lights down low
Trying to figure out my mind
She always wonder where I go
Tell her, Good music
Coming home with a pocket full of tulips
She want to point a finger at me, no excuses
Trying end up in that pussy like two lips

[Pre-Chorus]
She wants to off my head
Wants to off my head, my head
Can we both, forget
Baby I don't know
Want me more or less
Want me more or less, or less
Is it all for sex?
Baby, I hope so

[Chorus]
So tell me what you want, what you really really want
I ain't got time, if you think that you're in love, with me
So tell me what you want from me. oh
I ain't got time, if you really wanna fuck
You're bitching all the time, that you never get enough from me
So tell me what you want from me. ohh

[Verse 2]
Sitting in the hotel lobby
You never get me off my phone
Treat me like a paparazzi
I show up then I got to go
Make good music
Everybody that I'm meeting is a doofus
They try to point an arrow at me like cupid
I want to end up in that pussy like two lips

[Pre-Chorus]
She wants to off my head
Wants to off my head, my head
Can we both, forget
Baby I don't know
Want me more or less
Want me more or less, or less
Is it all for sex?
Baby, I hope so

[Chorus]
So tell me what you want, what you really really want
I ain't got time, if you think that you're in love, with me
So tell me what you want from me. oh
I ain't got time, if you really wanna fuck
You're bitching all the time, that you never get enough from me
So tell me what you want from me. ohh

[Verse 3: OCD: Moosh and Twist]

[Moosh]
I say
Whatcha want from me
You want a college guy?
A little yes man who like to work from nine to five
I ain't trippin' because I know you make a lot of dough
But I might see you on the tour girl you never know
When I ain't even mad at you
You get what you had to do
Heard you go to Georgia Tech
Well I go to Savage U
Said you never heard me
Turn around and get me dirty
I would of got you a drink
If I knew you were gonna be thirsty

[Twist]
The worlds heavy on me now
Feel like I can't move at all
And when I got it down
Feel like I'm a lose it all
Everyday feel like the worst day ever
When I'm with you girl
It feel like my birthday, never
I mean, tell me why I really want you right now?
I wanna love you but all you wanna do is fight now
Tell me how its backwards girl, you need practice girl
You about to make me bounce like a mattress girl. I said!

[Chorus]
Tell me what you want, what you really really want
I ain't got time, if you think that you're in love, with me
So tell me what you want from me. oh
I ain't got time, if you really wanna fuck
You're bitching all the time, that you never get enough from me
So tell me what you want from me. ohh

[Outro]
Girl, we can get it on tonight
If you do that little thing I like
I don't want to fall in love
Because I'm only here for the night
Girl, we can get it on tonight
If you do that little thing I like
I don't want to fall in love
Because I'm only here for the night
