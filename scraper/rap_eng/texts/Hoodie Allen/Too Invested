[Intro]
Ooh yeah, ooh yeah, ooh yeah
She want my money right now, now, now
Now, now, now, now

[Verse 1]
Yo, I don't really need a backup plan
I'm looking in the mirror like, god damn
It's an attractive man
I go hard like I'm trying to catch a taxi cab in rush hour, but no Jackie Chan
Yeah, you try, but I actually can
You stuck up like a maxi pad
My new album's a classic, man
If you don't believe me, ask a fan
I'm too high like Americans in Amsterdam
I need to come back down to Earth
I've been waiting all night for you to say the word
Yeah, I'm the shark with the business ship
But when you around me, girl, it's safe to surf
I'mma buy you a drink, you can get dessert
Say you love New York City but you hate the 'burbs
I said, "We all gotta come from somewhere
You might as well make it work"
And she asking me, "What's the worth if you make a little money but you really ain't happy, though?
And these other dudes around you, they be acting like they DiCaprio but they only got a cameo?"
So I be putting on for my family, though
Ain't got too many people in the world I can trust
I grab the check and she say, "What's the rush?
Stay for the night and let's talk about us"
I said

[Chorus]
All I know is everything is gonna fly away eventually
And I'm trying to find the words to say
To show you what you meant to me, yeah
Question, girl, I got a question
Girl, who the one you sexting, girl, late night?
Give you my confession
Girl, here's another question, is that alright?
I was doing bad things, but I ain't never been arrested
Put the money in the bank, girl, I ain't never too invested

[Verse 2]
Too invested, too aggressive
Let me take a step backwards
You say some shit then I say some shit
And I forget what the facts were
Read between the lines, you ain't an actor
You could be my ex or be my factor
One and only person I look after
After you, there won't be any chapters
That could be my fucking happy ending
She told me I'm super condescending
I apologize, but I'm pretending
Oh, I guess that's what she meant
Always think I'm right like I'm playing for the Mets
Everything I do, I'm always doing it my best
Take it from a motherfucker who don't ever sleep
If you trying to come at me, you should give that shit a rest
Young Dracula, doing donuts in my Acura
Big money, I'mma back you up
Too broke, gotta pack it up
But 2Pac, I ain't mad at ya, it just didn't work out
So I won't be sleeping around, please have no doubt
Don't need to sleep on the couch
Cause when I feel down, I know we'll figure this out
I'm glad that I have you around

[Chorus]
All I know is everything is gonna fly away eventually
And I'm trying to find the words to say
To show you what you meant to me, yeah
Question, girl, I got a question
Girl, who the one you sexting, girl, late night?
Give you my confession
Girl, here's another question, is that alright?
I was doing bad things, but I ain't never been arrested
Put the money in the bank, girl, I ain't never too invested
Too invested, ooh I got a question
Girl, do you think you're ready for it?
Question, girl, I got a question
Am I really what you waiting for? Nah
Cause I was doing bad things, but I ain't never been arrested
Put the money in the bank, girl, I ain't never too invested

[Outro]
Too invested, too invested
I'm too invested, I'm too invested
