[Intro]
Yeah
First team
That OG shit, check it

[Verse 1]
It was a Brooklyn summer like no other
She got me feeling like I really love her
And I don’t know if it’s the feeling but I didn’t see it coming
Talking Michael Oher meet Stevie Wonder
I wonder if she’ll break my heart
If I recover will it hurt and will I suffer
Will.i.am but got no Fergie, immature and almost thirty
Think the world has done me dirty but it treat me just like any other
But fuck it I need opinions like I need my mother
Aka I’m so dependent on 'em
Please don’t be offended by the things I say when I’m around ya
I just get a little tongue tied, mouth dry, does it sound familiar?
If you feel the way I feel, baby keep it real
Cause you the total package even got the sex-appeal
Murder in the first degree cause she dressed to kill
I could be the JT to your Jessie Biel

[Chorus]
If you want it you can get it
Na na na
If you want it you can get it
Na na na
If you want my heart then you can cut me open
Treat me like a surgeon fix it when it’s broken
If you want it you can get it
Na na na
If you want it you can get it
Na na na
If you want my mind then read it like a psychic
Keep you by my hip babe you can be my sidekick

[Verse 2]
If you want my love you gotta keep it simple
I tell her lay it all on me like it’s rudimental
I could play a couple songs by homie Ed
It’s gonna get your pussy wet, get your pussy wet
I apologize for saying pussy
I’m a rookie when it comes to long-term I am always playing hooky
Trying to find a way out, or way to take a day off
R.I.P. to my relationship, we need a seance
She be feeling so empowered that she just turned Bey' on
Should have stayed together till the end
You were my day one
But you know how a player do
I always gotta play on
I guess you gotta cut me open just like operation, operation
We don’t stay too long girl it’s only a vacation
I know you said some crazy things
I said some too
But the truth is I’m better off with you

[Chorus]
If you want it you can get it
Na na na
If you want it you can get it
Na na na
If you want my heart then you can cut me open
Treat me like a surgeon fix it when it’s broken
If you want it you can get it
Na na na
If you want it you can get it
Na na na
If you want my mind then read it like a psychic
Keep you by my hip babe you can be my sidekick
If you want it you can get it
Na na na
You can get it
Na na na
If you want it you can get it
Na na na
You can get it
Na na na
If you want my
