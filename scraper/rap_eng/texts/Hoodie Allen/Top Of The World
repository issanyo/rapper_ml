[Verse 1]
Bad girls, all in the mad world
Gave 'em the Mase flow, don't know they dad girls
Tell em I got a place they can visit that's near the beach
You never settle for nothing, but money is what you preach
So peace, to the old life
Got the same old car but nowadays I don't drive
Kicking it with people that do wrong their whole life
And yeah I'm still up on that high horse, Old Spice
And they don't want to mess around, they just want to get in for free
Don't we all man? It's feelin' fantastic
Get up on my level, where you at bitch?

[Hook]
Oh, I'm on top of the world
I'm on top of the world
We making money right now
Yeah, yeah, we making money right now
Oh, I'm on top of the world
I'm on top of the world
We making money right now
Yeah, yeah, so let me give it all out

[Verse 2]
Can you make your booty bounce like hers?
Ah, ah, is everything I ask absurd?
If I dig a little deeper, can I get below the surface
I paid all my attention baby, don't that mean I earned this?
I went from working at Google, to watching my Google Alerts
Now, I got a buzz bigger than Google Earth
All my fans are virgins, let me get a word in
I ask them who they favorite is, they screaming "You the first"
I like to hear that, hear that
They been telling my we're back, we're back
In business, but nowadays who isn't
Treat it like a holiday every time you visit
Don't be dumb and fall in love with an actress
She ask what room are Ewing, Patrick
And now I'm always on top, like a fascist
Get up on my level, where you at bitch?

[Hook]

[Bridge]
I take all my days, and rewind them back
Throw it all away, and let the real shit last
I take all my days, and rewind them back
Throw it all away, and let the real shit last

[Verse 3]
Standing at the top of the world yelling "Geronimo"
From the top of my lungs, made it on to the honor roll
Your boy made it, the education was worth it
I know you paying for dinner, but let me pay for dessert
It's the most that I can do, and the least that you deserve
I can't afford a lot, but I can give you my word
Word, it's real talk, but they be saying we average
Get up on my level, where you at bitch?

[Hook]
