[Chorus]
When I think about all the time I wasted with you that make me mad, mad mad
I prolly shoulda known that I never get the approval of your dad, dad dad (shoulda known)
But I couldn't get you outta my head
That's how you ended up in my bed
'Cause every new beginning come from some other beginning's end
So let's do it all again

[Verse 1]
Uh, when I think about you the madness it multiplies
If time is money I guess that time would be overpriced
We always fight, cursin' me out like it's poltergeist
Ten minutes later we makin' out and it's no surprise
You meditatin' in my livin' room, you so in line
You hate the way that I talk, you tell me I'm so Long Island
You're super fly without tryin', girl you're on auto pilot
But I can tell what you thinkin', I feel like Nostradamus
Oh my God, you're a goddess, I'll never break a promise to you
No, no matter, regardless, I'm always being honest with you
Even if it's impossible, I'ma Tom Cruise it
I ain't like them other dudes, are you stupid?

[Chorus]
When I think about all the time I wasted with you that make me mad, mad mad
I prolly shoulda known that I never get the approval of your dad, dad dad (shoulda known)
But I couldn't get you outta my head
That's how you ended up in my bed
'Cause every new beginning come from some other beginning's end
So let's do it all again

[Verse 2]
Uh, every day I'm with you, it's like the same story
I'm on my Groundhog shit, I feel like Bill Murray
I tell you all of my secrets like an informant
You straight from London, I'm so glad that you imported
I wanna see you in my bed, each and every mornin'
Even if you got a early meeting with your bosses
I'll go and make you coffee
Every girl that's in your posse's a 5'11'' Aussie
When you text me where you at
I come on over ASAP Rocky
Okay you got me, got me, I'm just so glad you want me
But other times I feel unqualified, you Donald Trump me
So what's I'm meant to do but write a song about it?
If it sells a million albums then I won't be mad about it, hoo

[Chorus]
When I think about all the time I wasted with you that make me mad, mad mad
I prolly shoulda known that I never get the approval of your dad, dad dad (shoulda known)
But I couldn't get you outta my head
That's how you ended up in my bed
'Cause every new beginning come from some other beginning's end
So let's do it all again

[Bridge]
I, I used to always be so mad, mad, mad
But now, I give up everything I had, had, had
Just to spend one more day with you
You really got me wantin' it bad
Oh, 'cause everything you do is like home
And now that you got me so, you got me so mad

[Chorus]
When I think about all the time I wasted with you that make me mad, mad mad
I prolly shoulda known that I never get the approval of your dad, dad dad (shoulda known)
But I couldn't get you outta my head
That's how you ended up in my bed
'Cause every new beginning come from some other beginning's end
So let's do it all again
