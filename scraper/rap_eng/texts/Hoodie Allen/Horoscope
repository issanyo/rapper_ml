When you call me on the phone, it's like I already know
My heart's skipping beats while I'm taking off your clothes
You can come right to my place
Watching TV all alone
But I can see your future though, I don't need no horoscope
No horoscope, no horoscope
Worry about the signs when it's just me on your mind
No horoscope, no horoscope
You're just where you're meant to be
So come right here and lay with me

[Verse 1: Hoodie Allen]
Word, that's how I feel
You're just my type and I mean that for real
But I don't need a psychic to get enlightened
I call this chick Muay Thai because she bringing sidekicks
Got all your friends with you like a chaperone
Because they ain't tryna see us in a cab alone
And I'm a Leo like DiCaprio, AKA I never play a crappy role
Let me step up to the plate
This ain't no accident girl it's just fate
Always on flights, I'll meet you at the gate
Text when we land at a quarter to 8
LAX to JFK, she be reading all the signs
Even when they don't say my name, say-say my name
Well that's Beyonce's shit
We living life like our actions got no consequence

[Verse 2: Hoodie Allen]
Must've been an Astro girl because you know I bag well
You've been with too many assholes girl, it's obvious I can tell
And I ain't tryna hit that shit and quit it
I'll put in 10,000 hours like my name was Malcolm Gladwell
So if you got a problem I can fix it
I ain't in this shit for gimmicks, I ain't never saying farewell
Well, peace out to all of those dudes
Right now I'm trying to cruise, turn on the news
I turned on your girlfriend one time and now she is turning on you
I didn't mean to wreck homes, I'd rather give them a makeover
With this Maker's Mark in me it's hard to relate sober
We get a little closer every time you stay over
Reach another level then it's game over
