[Intro: Hoodie Allen]
Yeah
You're crashing in right now
It's Making Waves
By your new favorite crew
Hoodie Allen
We gonna start it off right now
With out further ado
We're coming live to you

[Verse 1: Hoodie Allen]
People start to listen and they wonder if the beat break
I'll be rolling rich even if I rock the cheap skates
Life's a yearbook, never get a retake
And all the good times going faster than a speed date
You wonder why we late? Good question
Never thought we'd make it here now who'd guess it?
New lesson: Treat these moments like a blessin
I'm trynna find direction and you trynna GPS it
And no BSing on this roller coaster we thrilled
We just cut the line trynna get the seat filled
And now you're strapped in acting like we chilled
I know you love it when we go and let the beat build
We feel better then we ever been
I need to clear my head excedrin
I'm taking off to somewhere big and I be hoping that you getting in
But if you don't I know I'll see you when I get home
They say the road is just your favourite place to get grown
So for the people that I dissed and I led on
You can be the people that I miss when I head on

[Hook: Hoodie Allen]
I feel so high tonight
I don't wanna see the ground
Don't look down, don't look down
Life can be so simple
When living in the clouds
Don't look down
Don't look down

[Verse 2: Hoodie Allen]
Ain't no better time than the present
Maybe if we never count the future
And I promise if I said it then I meant it
And I never meant to be the one to shoot your
Dreams down, see clouds and the sounds just opened up
And if they looking for a change then I hope it's us
I know it's tough, so is anything that's worth it
I'm making it my business to deserve it

[Hook: Hoodie Allen]
I feel so high tonight
I don't wanna see the ground
Don't look down
Don't look down
Life can be so simple
When living in the clouds
Don't look down
Don't look down
