[Verse 1: Hoodie]
Sometimes I wish I could just take a break and skate around
Even if I suck at skating, sunny day’s I’m staying out
An 80’s baby, but can’t look to Ronald Reagan now
My liberal education’s taking all the love to break it down
Ok this is real as shit, tell me if you ready for
Insert famous person, work‘em in a metaphor
I’m almost famous like Kate Hudson, I met a whore
My friends don’t really call me
Well fuck those losers I’m better off
Unless they’re trying to get some tickets to my concert
And I just tell ‘em they missin’ out if they not here
Lebron’s here, Plus my mom’s here
I love my Japanese fans, this a bomb year! Uh, no Nagasaki
And when I get up on the beat I kill it like a (...)
I’m not gonna say it. Don’t make me say it
Well

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Duh, next, unapologetic
I live my life the way I want so I do not regret it
I’ll be in the game eventually cause I’m so J.J. Redick
I am white, I got money, people wanna see me debted
Y’all are chicken, y’all are breaded
Yo let’s keep it cooked up in the cage
I follow all my hater’s doin’ on they twitter page
And send them messages and end it with a smiley face
Mikey asked me why I engage?
Well that’s because I ain’t made it
YET
Well "yet" is open to the future
I’m so odd, I’m so used to
Getting all this love, give it to my producer
Dancing on your face like I invented the two-step
Well, then you can really call me Einstein
Because we dropping out the beat when I rhyme
I know a couple people here tryna hurt me
Cuz all these French broads screaming
Merci, merci, merci!

[Hook]

[Outro]
No I can’t be that guy
Merci, merci
No I can’t be that guy
Psh ya you welcome
No I can’t be that guy

I don’t wanna be anything other than what I’ve been tryna be lately
Psh ya you welcome
