[Hook: Marina and the Diamonds]
You've been acting awful tough lately
Smoking a lot of cigarettes lately
But inside, you're just a little baby
It's okay to say you've got a weak spot
You don't always have to be on top
Better to be hated than love, love, loved for what you're not

[Verse 1: Hoodie Allen]
They telling me to take the safe route, this is the detour
Hoodie baby you ain't seen a kid like this before him
Late night shooting for the moon like Warren
Them hits come out as soon as you hit recording
Born in America, Chevy and Ford
But these Greek ladies loving me, they saying he's foreign
Floored em, glued the crowd down by they boot strap
Came up on the scene so quick you'd think we was a newscast
Well newsflash, I can see through that
People try to hide what's on their mind like a do-rag
Never would I do that, I'm real fucking hustler
You be in the background making noise like a muffler
But if it doesn't kill me it makes me tougher
And that's the message that I pass onto my brother
You never really gonna make a difference 'til you suffer
But we passed that, now it's time to smash that, thunder

[Hook]
You've been acting awful tough lately
Smoking a lot of cigarettes lately
But inside, you're just a little baby
It's okay to say you've got a weak spot
You don't always have to be on top
Better to be hated than love, love, loved for what you're not

[Verse 2: Hoodie Allen]
Lately, I been staying on my grind like a skateboard
I got some Rocket Power now so let's take off
We going hard over these beats y'all just stay soft
I don't even feel the need to say pause
Cause you a cheat to the system how you came and Bernie Madoff'd
I'm a firm believer that the hard work pays off
The playoffs, I treat them like Mora did
That means I'm working with a little to get more of it
And anybody who doubted us we ignoring it
I'm on a different mission, an exhibition no scoring it
So if we more legit they treat us like a compound
Yeah they want to break us down, never gonna stop now
Cause being scared will only eat you like a cop out
Life's a haunted house, I'm ready to pop out
And shout outs to Marina for these pop sounds
I know you really love me but let's let the chorus drop now

[Hook]
You've been acting awful tough lately
Smoking a lot of cigarettes lately
But inside, you're just a little baby
It's okay to say you've got a weak spot
You don't always have to be on top
Better to be hated than love, love, loved for what you're not

[Outro: Hoodie Allen]
Slow up
Sometimes I'm just feeling like a robot
Sitting around hoping that you'll show up
But you know what, you know what
Slow up
Sometimes I'm just feeling like a robot
Sitting around hoping that you'll show up
But you know what, you know what

[Hook]
You've been acting awful tough lately

But inside, you're just a little baby
It's okay to say you've got a weak spot
You don't always have to be on top
Better to be hated than love, love, loved for what you're not
