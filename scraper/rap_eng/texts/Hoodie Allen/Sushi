[Pre-Chorus]
I've been working hard to get this paper
If you ain't been with me from the start then see you later
I just throw my middle fingers up to all my haters
You know we doing well, well, well
OK

[Verse 1]
Did the work, put the time in
Screech by I'm like Dustin Diamond
Now I got girls all across the continent
I ain't in a rush, homie, trust the process
Lotta people mad that they don't live like this
Buy anything I want, I don't look at prices
Homie I'm a threat, do I look like ISIS?
Nah, I don't need to resort to violence
I'd rather kill them with kindness
Taking trips with your girl to the Indian Islands
And I bring her on tour, yo, I Nicki Minaj'd it
I be reppin' New York like I play for the Giants
But I root for the Jets 'cause I only fly private
Never stressed out homie, Twenty One Pilots
Tell me I'm the best, I don't gotta deny it
Blowing up my phone, but I'm never replying
'Cause

[Pre-Chorus]
I've been working hard to get this paper
If you ain't been with me from the start then see you later
I just throw my middle fingers up to all my haters
You know we doing well, well, well
OK

[Chorus]
Oh you think you got it made
Pull up in the Uber, it's a Escalade
Out in California where they throwing shade
'Cause I got that money rolling to me
I got, I got that Sushi, Sushi
Show up with no reservay
We don't stand in line, you know we never wait
Nobu, nobu, nobu homie grab a plate
'Cause I got that money rolling to me
I got, I got that Sushi, Sushi

[Verse 2]
Malibu booty, in a jacuzzi, she be dripped in Gucci
Watching some movies, rolling up doobies in a black SUV
Come through your college and I party harder than Jon Belushi
Iced like a koozie, I got all these girls tryna rock my Jewelry
So I never say sorry
Tryna get three, yeah, call me Dan Majerle
She got a friend, and her friend, got a friend, that's a party
I don't follow trends, Ed Hardy
All American like a Harley
Out in California that's gnarly
Take you on a boat, Lil Yachty
Can I hit it raw? Yea prolly, Sushi
Everybody know me, why the hell you introduce me?
'Cause

[Pre-Chorus]
I've been working hard to get this paper
If you ain't been with me from the start then see you later
I just throw my middle fingers up to all my haters
You know we doing well, well, well
OK

[Chorus]
Oh you think you got it made
Pull up in the Uber, it's a Escalade
Out in California where they throwing shade
'Cause I got that money rolling to me
I got, I got that Sushi, Sushi
Show up with no reservay
We don't stand in line, you know we never wait
Nobu, Nobu, Nobu homie grab a plate
'Cause I got that money rolling to me
I got, I got that Sushi, Sushi

[Outro]
Roll roll roll I
Roll roll roll I
Roll roll roll I
I got that sushi, sushi
Roll roll roll I
Roll roll roll I, roll
Sushi sushi sushi
