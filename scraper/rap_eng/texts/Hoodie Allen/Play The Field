[Intro]
How it feel?
How it feel?
Can you keep-
Can you keep it real?
Keep it real
I don't really know cause
I dont never show love
I'm just tryna play the field, play the field

[Bridge]
And it's over, 'for it started
I could leave you so departed
And I know you, tried your hardest
So I'm sorry, but I gotta

[Hook x3]
Play the field
Play the field
Play the field
Play the field
Play the field

[Verse 1]
Ok girl don't rush it, let's just take it slower
Girl let's not get married, let's wait 'til we're older
But if you really need that rock i'mma put you on a flight
Take you straight to boulder, no layover
Let me paint a picture for you, like Crayola
You say that my heart is cold like Minnesota
Say I push your buttons, I remote control ya
Tryna crack the code, I feel like Mr. Robot
Yeah, but I don't got time to be texting
All of my other Exs
I don't care what your friends think
'Cause if treating you good isn't good enough
You gon' have to find somebody else that does

[Bridge]
And it's over, 'for it started
I could leave you so departed
And I know you, tried your hardest
So I'm sorry, but I gotta

[Hook x3]
Play the field
Play the field
Play the field
Play the field
Play the field

[Verse 2]
Ok
Play the field like I'm Clint Fraiser
I'm up and coming, I'm so major
I pay my dues
I might break the news
I'm on the front page of that sunday paper
See ya later if y'all hating
Got no time to be conversating with broke rapper just call my agent
And all you hearin' is-*Dial tone plays*-Dial Tone
Fashion week in Paris, I just style on them
Run the trap
Every time I'm on it that's a milestone
That's your girl, why the hell she blowing up my iPhone
I ain't got no time to kick it, bitch I need a time loan
Every girl I'm dating been on the cover of NYLON
You can be my side kick, shorty riding shot gun
Say, "You should stick around if you a smart one"
You can watch me cruise, Top Gun

[Bridge]
And it's over, 'for it started
I could leave you so departed
And I know you, tried your hardest
So I'm sorry, but I gotta

[Hook x3]
Play the field
Play the field
Play the field
Play the field
Play the field
