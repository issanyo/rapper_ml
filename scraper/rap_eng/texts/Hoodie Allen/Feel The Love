[Hook]
You know I said it's true
I can feel the love, can you feel it too?
I can feel it, I can feel it
You know I said it's true
I can feel the love, can you feel it too?
I can feel it, I can feel it

[Verse 1]
And I ain't slept at home, not trying to be left alone
I'm waking up every morning to a metronome
With no alarm clock, I don't gotta set my phone
And no the bar stops selling alcohol after 2 AM
You no longer in New York City it's just you and them
And the people who fucking with me
I say they travel the world, I'm about to cover some distances
And I'm just trying to prove to y'all what the difference is
So when you love what you doing and then you missing it
I'mma send y'all regards, few postcards up in the mail
Jean Luc, I never fail
This is new wave rap, we never going to jail cuz
All I wanna do is drink wine and make babies
You ain't never had a sick line, Wayne Brady
Let me kick rhymes and y'all can kick rocks
Like bawitabadabangdabang

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
So let the good kids be a little bad
Let them stay out the night they selling the El Ray out
Feeling like King Charles, partying like Harry, girl
These the nights you sorry you got married
Well, single women like room service and take out
So will we make out? I'm so shore, I'm J-Wow
I'm running around the base now
Just trying to get my face down
You got a body let me work it like I'm Basedow
So shouts to Based God, we cooking in this
Top ten on Billboard, I be looking at this
I haven't found success, Em told me success sucks
But I found the best fans, you phonies should fess up, cuz
You ain't touching them, but you'd like to
Some people copying the steez, or they try to
I feel the love like my crew
You only really feel the love when you lied to
You lied to

[Hook]

[Break]
I don't wanna be one of the guys who tell you lies
I don't wanna sit beside them and take up all your time
But when I'm without you I feel like I've been paralyzed
Hit into my heart, hit into my chest
Hit into my knees, hit into my feet
Baby please I can feel the love

[Hook]
