[Verse 1: Puff Puff Humbert]
Man, I feel like we live in a life of Nintendo
Cause reality's such a hassle
Sometimes I even find my princess in another castle
I should ask Dr. Mario for medicine
Maybe hit up Little Nemo for a sedative
And slip into a Final Fantasy
Until the sequels get repetitive
You know I'll never let this stack up against me — Tetris
Some call me Pac-Man, mak-a-mak-a-mak-a
'Cause I eat these spirits for breakfast
And if my game ain't starting
Baby feel free to blow on my cartridge
Alcohol makes everything so pixelated when you party in a

[Verse 2: Hoodie Allen]
Nowadays, my life's so complicated
My TV is 3D, not pixelated
The music is for free and 5, 6, 7, 8 bit
Plug me in, you don't even gotta say shit
Hitting all my neighbors in Mercedes, okay they annoyed
Ask me why I do it, 'cause I'm all about the Paper Boy
Let me know that I am just the illest villain they employed
Let me slow it down, slow it down with the illest noise
Damn girl, you kinda made my screen froze
Take you to my D-pad, show you who's the hero
Give you all the recap, got a Metal Gear flow
'Cause I'm so solid, my whole team brolic
Came to L.A. man, now I gotta dodge her
You ain't gonna make it in these streets like Frogger
I'm on YouTube like a blogger
You heard me
Groupies wanna blow — Kirby

[Verse 3: Puff Puff Humbert & Hoodie Allen]
I drink until I feel like Tyson punched me out
And until these chicks get sick of us
I'll collect hearts like Kid Icarus
Hey Princess, did I tell you
I'm gonna be the next Legend of Zelda
I'm gonna be the one making noise
A real Mega Man amongst Paper Boys

[Verse 4: Hoodie Allen]
I take these ploys, lay them out
Tell them see you later
Haters getting in my face so I'ma call them Space Invaders
Once I get her, I'ma take her
Ya'll say that this is luck, son?
But they ain't ever shoot me down
Duck Hunt
