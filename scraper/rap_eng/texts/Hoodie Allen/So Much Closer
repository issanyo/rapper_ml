I need you so much closer
I need you na na now
I need you na na now
(x2)

[Verse 1: Hoodie Allen]
I know we got a ways to go, but lately I've been feeling like
We're so much closer
I don't wanna wait no more, I'm hung up on you
I'm like a poster
And this is how I take the flow, cause we going
Up and down and they calling it a coaster
But I don't want to take it slow, I'm doing
All the shit that I thought we supposed to to to to let you know
That this is real, and I mean it
Take you to an island, but no, not Revis
Gotta steal your heart and you know I'm not thieving even
If I foul up, never will I ref that
We've been cookin' up this chem like a meth lab
All the other people, never would I stress that
Cause you a cutie and I need you in my death cab

[Verse 2: Hoodie Allen]
I know we got a ways to go, but lately I've been feeling like
I'm chasing planets
And you never change your clothes, but you always
Seem to go and change your status
So I'm just tryna let you know that its so unneeded baby
Cause you the baddest
But I don't want to take it slow, you drive
Me like ford is-automatic
I-i-i-it might mean if you my addiction then I just feen
And ever since the day you've been likin' me
I'm assembling these lines like a height machine
No kathy lee, we don't need a sweatshop
Cause every time we drop a track, people get hot
And I've been aiming for the top like a headshot
Even when aiming for your heart was my best shot

[Bridge: Rocky Business]
I'm not saying I wouldn't ever do it again
But I hope that you'll be there when I open the door
And I swear that I'm trying hard to call you a friend
But I'm sorry I can't wait no more more more more
I'm sorry I can't wait no more more more more
I'm sorry I can't wait no more more more more
I'm sorry I can't wait, oh what the hell I sayin'
You know that I would wait because...
