[Intro: Hoodie Allen]
Yeah, yeah
First team bitch
Stop - Hoodie time

[Verse 1: Hoodie Allen]
Bitches bow down, don't even know me
Told me I'm a dog like Odie
And I only fuck with crazy girls like I'm home like I'm Brody
Made her come trice like Obie, damn
So I don't shop at Alexander McQueen (why?)
I don't even know what that mean
Tryna live life on an everyday scheme
The minute you met me was kind of a wet dream, well
We don't got that in common
These bitches want the Action Bronson
I give a little Magic Johnson
Then she wanna hold my wand like Emma Watson
Oh they mad cause I got flow
And these other rappers cheesy like a nacho
So my pockets getting bigger like Lovato
But you ain't got no fuckin' Hoodie in your Serato?

[Hook: Hoodie Allen]
Talk to me, tell me your name
You want my life, I want the same
You say that it's meant to be, it's meant to be
You ain't no celebrity, so stop
Cause fame is for assholes

[Verse 2: Hoodie Allen]
Hold up, stop, came here with a mission
They didn't pick me first like I'm Griffin
But I don't give a fuck, no Luck I got 20/20 vision
I can see like everything he missin'
Got a bad bitch, she my cash cow, she my cash cow
I'mma make a million dollars so I have her pass out
Pass blunts, babe, I can get you Emma Stoned
And I don't ever leave my bed alone
Tryna tell my future like Cleo
Tell me Iâ€™m the one, treat the kid like he Neo, damn
Thousand white bitches in the club, that's a kilo
Let me spill this cash like the Rio, Grande
I'm all about the ass and bush
That's why they lookin' at me like I'm Ashton Kush
I'm a bastard, look
I'm a fashion crook
So let me take your clothes off, damn

[Hook]
Cause fame is for assholes
Cause fame is for assholes
Cause fame is for assholes
Cause fame is for assholes
Cause fame is for assholes

[Verse 3: Chiddy Bang]
Stop - Chiddy time
I hear girl like "come to the telly"
Hit me on the phone you could run to the celly
Just walked in, why they lookin' at me doe?
Girl you the bomb, could we lay like Frito?
I got my jacket for you if you a tad cold
Swack ho, probably gettin' tail like a tadpole
First time I seen her man she wave like a flagpole
She tryna fuck fame but that shit is for assholes
Yeah, since I heard they finish first
I'mma appetize then I get that pussy for dessert
Clock, clock in you know I always put in work
Tryna find her easy she got designer on her purse
I don't need to know your accolades
I could do that shit in half a day
Act brand new but that's okay
Cause I'm about to get the cat, Anne Hathaway, hey!

[Hook]
Cause fame is for assholes
Cause fame is for assholes
Cause fame is for assholes
Cause fame is for assholes
Cause fame is for assholes
