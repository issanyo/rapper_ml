[Intro](4x)
Day dreaming and I'm thinking of you
Day dreaming and I'm thinking of you -ou- ou

[Verse 1]
Alright, look, just a day dream, just another memory
Just another beat to rock, just another melody
My mind sprinting like it's trying to get ahead of me
When we out in public you been actin' like my enemy
Sorry to Obey, another def reference
It don't even matter we get paid like severance
Seven figures in my bank account
And you wonder why I'm payin' when I take them out
Say it now like tourettes if I'm bout to me next
Then why's it kinda feeling like the opposite
I'm playing down like the Mets, so I found that it's best
To be the underdog cause no one likes the obvious
The lobby is filled with people
They robbin' us, I'm Robin Hood, I'm stealing back
Probably never popular but stoppin' us up in our tracks
Quicksand, fame is not a quick plan
I don't plan on going home
I plan on going big man

[Hook](4x)
Day dreaming and I'm thinking of you
Day dreaming and I'm thinking of you -ou- ou
(I hit her with the )

[Verse 2]
No matter how hard I deny it, it's time to face maturity
Pops telling me to get a job with security
Surely, but with my girl steady trying to hurry me
It's got me asking questions, thinking twice about her purity
Nah, I shrug it off, that could never be the case
Told her "umm I bet I make these eggs in my face"
Just eggs and no hate, Bernie Madoff, she frauding
Play another show and I'll get another braud in the audience
It's always a promise, but I'll never call
Got'em wrapped around my finger, just like it's a tether ball
It's in satisfaction, later I'm feeling terrible
Cause I can't replace something that's uncomparable
Ha-ha, I'm just kidding, are you catching on, Jason Witten?
She said she's into fitness and wants to have my kids quick
I run out and tell her I'm that I'm late to handle business
I'm never coming back

[Hook](3x)

[Outro](2x)
Said that I'm thinking about
Something else that I can do
But thinking of you
