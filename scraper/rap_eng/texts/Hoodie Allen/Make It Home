[Intro: Kina Grannis]
I wanna go where the lights are low and the dreamers are chasing
I wanna live like we don't know much but we know we're gonna make it
And I don't wanna spend another night alone
I wanna go cause if we don't leave now, then we're never gonna make it home

[Verse 1: Hoodie Allen]
I'm living front row
Ya'll can take the mezzanine
Backseat chillin'
Treating life like it's a magazine
Seventeen and making money, with no doubt
Had a crush on Gwen Stefani, yeah no doubt
Like I woke up inside a new bugatti
Let's roll out
Nobody told me this was just a hobby
You know now
But if you didn't then you probably would have got it
I remember breaking even
Now we out here making profit
I ain't trying to take the throne
But baby give me options like I'm Geno Smith
I tell them do it on your own me and Kina did
And now we trying to take the road less traveled
Cause sometimes the best shit's secret
So pick your own ways cause we don't need it
I'm doing it my way, so don't impede it, no
And if you say it’s just a dream I don’t feel it
You wanna take me down a notch but this is more appealing like
I got the type of life that no one trying to mess with
You got that McKayla Maroney bitches ain't impressed with, you

[Hook: Kina Grannis]
Oh-oh oh-oh waiting 'til I make it home [2x]

[Verse 2: Hoodie Allen]
I ain't a movie star, I ain't a ball player
But if you ask me what I do, I do it all player
I got these girls going wild like I'm John Mayer
And I don't need a damn guitar
Watch me I'm going far
Living out all my dreams
I used to live in my car
Now it's a limousine
I put it in the garage
Right next to my degrees
Hundred dollars for a hat
Trying to keep it supreme
I bet you're trying to fit in with your best friends
Well your best friends
Made some bad investments
I wish I could but I don' believe you for a second
You said you living good well call me when the mets win
The mets win it in the pennant
Doing it independent
They told me I hit a wall
They wondering where I'm headed
Busy buying the bar and they busy trying to rent it
It happens when you sit around and wait cause you forget it
And I be playing poker with a blind man, throwing all my chips in
Working till I'm breaking every record like I'm Ripken
Bang

[Hook 4x]
