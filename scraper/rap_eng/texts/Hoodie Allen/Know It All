[Intro]
La, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la

[Verse 1]
I might be high
Tonight my day is not going just like
I fucking promised myself (oh god damn)
Oh girl, I need some help
Will you be that help?
Okay, I'm feeling drunk
I don't know how and what, where I came from
All of these parties the same
Lord, I don't know your name
Then it hit me
This must be a miracle
It's not Christmas but I'm so
Gifted, wrap it with a bow
And I'll end up right at your door
(knock, knock, knock)

[Chorus]
Some people think they know it all, know it all (know it all)
But I spend all my days trying to improve (tryna improve)
Tell me how can I grow if you're standing on my toes (on my toes)
Because some people think they know it all, know it all (know it all)
They don't want me, want me, want me
They don't want me, want me

[Verse 2]
Oh, God damn I'ma be the man when they kick me out of juvie
My life is a motherfucking motion picture movie
God, put your camera back in your pocket
We're gonna have to have a little talk
I don't wanna see it on that Snap, Snap, Snap
If you got a bad rap, well, I ain't never had that
Might have been the police, so girl, shh, keep it lowkey
'Cause I think you should get to know me tonight
Damn, if you will maybe I might stick around for another round
Get a little money coming down
Throw that motherfucking liquor out
Never ever really had a doubt that you were a freak
And you know from me that we roll like one pod with two peas
Oh, God damn Hoodie

[Chorus]
Don't people think they know it all, know it all
But I spend all my days trying to improve (trying to improve)
Tell me how can I grow if you're standing on my toes
Because some people think they know it all, know it all (know it all)
They don't want me, want me, want me
They don't want me, want me, want me
Oh god damn this feel good right now, right now

[Chorus]
Some people think they know it all, know it all (know it all)
But I spend all my days trying to improve (tryna improve)
Tell me how can I grow if you're standing on my toes (on my toes)
Because some people think they know it all, know it all
But they don't
