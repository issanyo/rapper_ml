[Hook: Jared Evan]
Girl, we're getting older
So toast to the sky
And don't stop till it's over
Light up the night
We shouldn't live like we're sober
So toast to the sky
And we won't stop till it's over

[Verse 1: Jared Evan]
Feel like the world is calling
And now my head is spinning
There’s so much going on and
I can’t make a decision
Well I don’t wanna stop at all
Never drop the ball
I’d do this on my own
And if we can have it all
Then we’ll never fall
And be here till it’s gone

[Hook: Jared Evan]
So go ahead and call us crazy
It’s never gonna change who we are
Everything we want let’s chase it
So everybody reach for the stars
Girl, we're getting older
So toast to the sky
And don't stop till it's over
Light up the night
We shouldn't live like we're sober
So toast to the sky
And we won't stop till it's over

[Verse 2: Jared Evan]
So now my phone is ringing
I never know who’s calling
All of my friends are missing
This life just seems so boring
But I’ll never stop it all
Till I make the call
And hold it in my arms
We just wanna rock n roll
Till the music’s gone
And do it all again

[Hook: Jared Evan]
So go ahead and call us crazy
It’s never gonna change who we are
Everything we want let’s chase it
So everybody reach for the stars
Girl, we're getting older
So toast to the sky
And don't stop till it's over
Light up the night
We shouldn't live like we're sober
So toast to the sky
And we won't stop till it's over

[Verse 3: Hoodie Allen]
If soul music was a trip
Then we could take a 30 day vacation, we could split
Leave the car in the garage, leave the drama at the crib
Said I did it all for you, you don't gotta ask me shit
Like, why I work so hard and baby you should take a break
Said I'm Jazzy Jeff to em', I'm just trynna break the banks
And all my friends just show me love, I try to give em' thanks
Coz if they left the picture now it's a mistake
Fuck riding in a Benz, rather roll up in a tank
Living practical
Said I'm only looking for a rose, what would Axl do
People love to lie and cheat, I just keep it factual
Pullin out my hair so let the grey come gradual, uh
We getting older baby how could I be mad at you
We getting older but I’ll never be a fad to you
Trynna build a legacy, so pour a little Hennesy
And toast mother fucker like we throwing out the manual
Bang

[Hook: Jared Evan]
Girl, we're getting older
So toast to the sky
And don't stop till it's over
Light up the night
We shouldn't live like we're sober
So toast to the sky
And we won't stop till it's over
