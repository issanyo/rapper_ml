[Hook]
Where do we go now
Where do we go now
Where do we go now
Where do we go now
When we can't go home now
Probably get thrown out
So where do we go now
Where do we go now, oh

[Verse 1]
And I'm a product of my environment
That's why these people buy my music when I'm supplyin' it
They tell me life is always sunny not ultra-violet
I feel like Bradley Cooper tryna find me a silver lining
And I don't need a, suit or tie to keep me alive
I just need a good ass crew and a long ass drive, word
Keep it movin' and keep improvin' the same time
People love me but hate me on the same rhyme
Damn, that's just how I feel man
I ain't one of those rappers who got a deal man
Quit askin', every milestone you try to conquer, I passed it
Every album we drop's a classic
That's the way we love to congregate the masses
Your momma got a fatty, it's kinda hard to look past it
And I'm a educated bastard
Rapping is how I'ma get my masters

[Hook]
So where do we go now
Where do we go now
Where do we go now
Where do we go now
When we can't go home now
Probably get thrown out
So where do we go now
Where do we go now, oh

[Verse 2]
And I never think I'd be a hero
Growing up with my dad and learning from Al Pacino
Jets fool, middle finger to all you Dan Marinos
I'm living in a movie and feeling like Tarantino
Corleone, I'm tryna get my De Niro
Work some long nights and I don't need a cappuccino
All falls down when you live in the casino
Uh, and I'm just tryna add some mutha fucking zeros
So point at Pelegrino, shouts to itsthebino
Shouts out to BrentonRules, I didn't know where we would be yo, uh
Back then, getting dinner in Connecticut
Talking 'bout all these rappers we hated then getting mad as shit
Haha, like those were those the days
We were livin' off the feeling it was going our way
Uh, I know that life changes fast
But I'd rather freeze the moment than go back and live the past

[Hook]
So where do we go now
Where do we go now
Where do we go now
Where do we go now
When we can't go home now
Probably get thrown out
So where do we go now
Where do we go now, oh

[Verse 3]
I ain't tryna front and tell you it's all confidence
I'm just tryna catch up to other rappers like condiments
'Cause I remember when we got no compliments
Opening up for Sean was like my biggest accomplishment
I have my friends going nuts in the front
Acting like I'm the hottest shit until Pusha demolished it
One by one we created a following
I learned a lot in class but hated being a college kid
And when I graduated labels started hollering
Work through so much dough, I needed a scholarship
Went to the bank, emptied what I deposited
Then put it into one mixtape, I'm so positive
I'll never make one mistake, I'm so confident
There ya go again, rapping is all opposites
I don't even care if I make it to the top of shit
'Cause I'm a keep on ripping and shouts to Jesse Katsopolis
Woo!

[Bridge]
I said I'm a keep on ripping and shouts to Jesse Katsopolis
A Full House in it
Full House in it, yeah
Jared's on the beat
And thank you Fresh
Let's go
Crew Cuts

[Hook]
So where do we go now
Where do we go now
Where do we go now
Where do we go now
When we can't go home now
Probably get thrown out
So where do we go now
Where do we go now, oh
