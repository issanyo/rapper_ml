[Hook: Ricky Smith]
I never wanted to make you feel alone
I never wanted to leave you on your own
But if you look up sometimes, you just might find
That you’re not that far from home
I never wanted to make you feel alone

[Verse 1: Hoodie Allen]
Yo, but what I’m feeling right now is, astounded
I used to be the lone wolf but I’m surrounded
By people who love me, or say they proud of me
Like, where the fuck were you when I only had family?
Had to move back home and prove anything was possible
Under pressure, that’s logical
Whoever’s hating I’m David Blaine-ing my obstacles
This kid has got a lot of flow
There’s no denying but somehow I got the people divided
I call that Gaza flow like no, no, no
I don’t pick sides, would not be right
Cause the M so biased
Sometimes the best way to handle a fight
Is a baseball bat with no glove
Sometimes we scream at the top of our lungs to show love
Sometimes the people we love don’t even know we exist
Sometimes the timing ain’t right
Sometimes it's just on my wrist
But that’s it, so let me handle my biz
And when I go to Ireland just let me handle my Guinness
Girl I be back in a minute, yeah you know, yeah you know, woo

[Hook: Ricky Smith]
I never wanted to make you feel alone
I never wanted to leave you on your own
But if you look up sometimes, you just might find
That you’re not that far from home
I never wanted to make you feel alone

[Verse 2: Hoodie Allen]
Yo I never make you feel alone
I always keep my shoulder close to you
Never wanna be one of those dudes that ended up on the local news
I never wanna leave you black and blue, I mean emotionally
My father taught me well, my mother still believes there’s hope for me
I never go to sleep, that’s the fear of missing out
These Cali girls are thirsty, that’s the fear of a drought
I say my fears out loud, but I don’t mean them
Walk a block to the bodega, like homie that shit convenient
That don’t mean the best convenience what’s easy
Don’t know what’s qualified
I’m the shopping Whole Foods overpriced brand that you wanna buy
The BMX you wanna ride, the rollercoaster that
Might leave you stranded at the top like right now, yo fuck, I gotta try
But when it’s all done, you’re with another guy
But he sucks, I’m motorboating your C-cups
He’s busy riding teacups
I’m performing in arenas, he’s out your league like I’m Venus
You say nothing comes between us
But you lie, lie, lie
At least I try, try, try, at least I try

[Hook: Ricky Smith]
I never wanted to make you feel alone
I never wanted to leave you on your own
But if you look up sometimes, you just might find
That you’re not that far from home
I never wanted to make you feel alone
