[Intro:]
These dreams, under my pillow
In the twilight of these white nights

[Verse 1]
It's been a minute now so tell me where to begin
I meet a lot of girls but they gon' treat me like a vegan
Another given Sunday it's a given I'll be dreamin'
They say the flow goes so out of this world, Willie Beamen
Up, up to Scotty, I can keep me down, bulimic
I'm new to bein' Hoodie but I'm over bein' Steven
I'm sorry mom, I really like my name, I swear I'd leave it
But a wise man told me I'd be smarter not to keep it
So I keep it, keep it
We get down
The only road I know is like the steepest now
And I'm on the outside but they can't keep me out
Cause that's not the way that my life should be
I'm over all nights and a tight MC
No overalls, tights but I might envy the view
Who just do like exactly what they told to
You are all my boys blue, I don't kick it old school
Told you that everyday Thanksgiving that crazy flow
Livin' out my dreams and ain't a price that I'm a trade it for

[Hook:]
Put them dreams under my pillow, pillow
Put them dreams up, make it all cash
If I build it up, I can dream a little, little
I can dream big, I can dream fast

Put them dreams under my pillow, pillow
Put them dreams up, make it all cash
If I build it up, I can dream a little, little
I can dream big, I can dream fast

[Verse 2:]
I, I can't decide
In this life I'm so obsessed with every ten I see like a titan
Vince Young and restless, homie I need to fight it
I'm never indecisive, I'm team Jacob
I'm never into fighting your team
Wake up so alone, they've never been invited
To the places that I crash or the room I spend the night in
Fightin' the urge to not splurge and play it cool
Amateurs on stage, looks something like a play in school
Drama, live by a bunch of Mr. G's
Wonder why they haven't taken off, what a mystery
Karma, everybody that hits repeat
Wonder why we haven't learned yet, well history
I'm honored, please get down and kiss the feet
If the shoe don't fit the beauty then it can fit the beast
Goner, like with the wind that fits the piece
Tell them suckers I know that I ain't ever missed a beat

[Hook:]
Put them dreams under my pillow, pillow
Put them dreams up, make it all cash
If I build it up, I can dream a little, little
I can dream big, I can dream fast

Put them dreams under my pillow, pillow
Put them dreams up, make it all cash
If I build it up, I can dream a little, little
I can dream big, I can dream fast

[Bridge:]
Now a days I got so much on my mind right
Left side brain but i'll see you when the time's right
I'm feelin' shallow baby, this gon' be your blond night
Left side brain but i'll see you when the time's right
Now a days I got so much on my mind right
Left side brain but i'll see you when the time's right
I'm feelin' shallow, uh, I'm feelin' shallow, uh, I'm feelin' shallow
Baby tell me when the time's right

[Hook:]

Put it up
