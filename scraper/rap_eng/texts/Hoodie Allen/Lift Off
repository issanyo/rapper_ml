[Verse 1: Hop Hobson]
I sip the O.E., puff with Sean Don till’ I’m gone
Break the green up on a record; make it look just like a lawn
Burn it like a DB and make it look just like DeSean
I take a hit or four and pass it like a fucking baton, now come on
Man, I'm betting they're tempted to split the tension
So I split a dutch, give a fuck, and plead the Fifth Amendment
You could love me, you could hate me, you could be a schizophrenic
This is my way, the highway; try not to miss the exit
And you can say that this is a cliché rap
But it’s just my life, and I live that shit laid back
I could be anywhere, but I’m right here with you instead
And I’m doing what I love; I’m something like a newlywed
Black Nikes, no hype, just like Boobie said
I’m living close to the edge; if you were closer you’d be dead
Don’t push, just blow Kush instead
And when they tell you “Slow your roll” say, "it'll you'll stop when you're dead."

[Hook: Hop Hobson]
Now move your hands this way, and move em’ that way
And live here right now, like it’s your last day
Cause we don’t give a fuck
Light up, lift off
No, we don’t give a fuck
Just light up, lift off

[Verse 2: Hoodie Allen]
It’s Hoodie, okay
Sitting in the kitchen fidgeting with all my vegetables
Wishing for top position, but slipping off the pedestal
Yeah this world will eat you up, spit you out inedible
Cause all you are is focused on that shit that’s inevidaba-ba
-bullshit, Green Day that’s a Dookie life
That’s why I do shows across the globe and all you do is whine
And dining, cheesing, leading till you fake it
While I’m digging into crates listening to Anita Baker
And you baking, I decline though, peeking through the blindfold
See a little shorty who be speaking in soprano
Said she came from Jersey super early, just to bond though
But changed her tune the second, she reckoned her friends had gone home
Left, in the rain, on a step, it’s a shame
All the rest would just complain, because she’s the best against the grain
My honey-oats get money, floats, so I invest in changing rocket ships
So I can lift off and you ain't stopping shit

[Hook: Hop Hobson]
Now move your hands this way, and move em’ that way
And live here right now, like it’s your last day
Cause we don’t give a fuck
Light up, lift off
No, we don’t give a fuck
Just light up, lift off

[Verse 3: Reef]
Life a paradox, livin' like an ox
See moron, I swore on the Quran, the Bible, and the Torah
So sacreligious
Triple threat stance so I’m standing on my pivot
I’m hungry, they doubted, they hate, I’m livid
College kid chilling, so they hate how I’m living
This cup that I sipping, good times is how I live it
Marina sing it, Hop it kilt it, then he flipped it
Fast life, and fast broads, they make you feel numb
Breath of fresh air, now I’m looking for my lungs
Now I’m looking for my girl, but she looking for the fun
I go for the gold, stay twiddling your thumbs
Now I’m going down a path, and it’s going to diverge
Do I break, do I sit straight, steer off, or then I swerve
Right, left, maybe backwards
Backwoods and a burn, now I can't be scared
Middle finger to the sky, now I’m flipping off the birds
Flip words, new meanings, double entendre
You do name, “I do reef”, that’s my mantra
Forget about yesterday, focus on manana

[Hook: Hop Hobson]
Now move your hands this way, and move em’ that way
And live here right now, like it’s your last day
Cause we don’t give a fuck
Light up, lift off
No, we don’t give a fuck
Just light up, lift off
