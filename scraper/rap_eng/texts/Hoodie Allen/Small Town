[Intro]
She in the city, but she from a small town
High heels, tall shots make her fall down
Up late, now she running with the fast crowd
But she calls me every night before she pass out

[Verse 1]
I don't wanna waste my time with girls who rolling they eyelids
Girls who lookin' for a place to stay
Because they came away from Long Island
I don't wanna make your mind up
I'm just tryna make you mine quick
But ever since I put you in my line-up
All I do is choke: Heimlich
Good girl in a bad dress
But ain't nothing really changed but your address
You in the Upper West Side
You were thinking other people
Would've never accepted all your assets?
But I'm Cashis and you cash poor
I'mma give you anything that you ask for
You a small town girl but you living in the city
So you always keep your heart near your passport

[Hook]
She in the city, but she from a small town
High heels, tall shots make her fall down
Up late, now she running with the fast crowd
But she calls me every night before she pass out
You ain't foolin' us
You from a small town
You ain't foolin' us
You from a small town

[Verse 2]
I don't know what's next for us
But every time I talk it's like I messed it up
People wanna tell me that I'm too honest
Walking on eggshells, two omelettes
And I know it's hard cause you left your town
Dad don't call like he let you down
You don't wanna talk when the sun is out
But if we get a little drunk, then it's all allowed
And the truth comes down, it's pouring, pouring
'Bout to drop bombs like Warren, Moon
Color of your skin be orange, orange
Aren't you the girl that I met last June?
Who was so damn fun man, where did she go?
On vacation, Puerto Rico
Grand Theft Auto in your heart like Niko
Trying to meet your mother like I'm Jason Segel

[Hook]
She in the city, but she from a small town
High heels, tall shots make her fall down
Up late, now she running with the fast crowd
But she calls me every night before she pass out
You ain't foolin' us
You from a small town
You ain't foolin' us
You from a small town

[Bridge]
I can take you anywhere on a map
I can make it all good
You can make me come back
You keep movin', I can find you on the map
I can take you back home
You can make me unpack
You in Atlanta, but you from a small town
You in Chicago, but you from a small town
You move to LA, but you from a small town
You live in Brooklyn but I know you from a small town

[Hook]
She in the city, but she from a small town
High heels, tall shots make her fall down
Up late, now she running with the fast crowd
But she calls me every night before she pass out
You ain't foolin' us
You from a small town
You ain't foolin' us
You from a small town

[Outro]
Yeah, all across the globe
In every town you know
Yeah, you ain't foolin' us
