[Intro]
I said my tour just sold out, album's been bought out
Girlfriend might put out – terrific
Oh that's the good route, shit that you dream 'bout
Now that you got it – feels different
I don't need no one, no one to tell me
Everything will be alright
Hair just like Elvis, hands on her pelvis
But let me delve in

[Verse 1]
I said I got a lot of dreams and you got a lot of needs
So there ain't a lot of time for me to help it
And I ain't slept in nearly 20 weeks, is that healthy?
I'm making money when I go to sleep, is that wealthy?
I'd rather talk about my self esteem but that's selfish
Lot of folks complain about the cards that you dealt me
But I'm still here shuffling the deck, yo what's come of it?
Used to know it all, now I'd rather just discover it
So fuck it, man, I said fuck it, man
Yo, fuck it, man, I'm just a lucky man

[Hook]
Baby I want it all
Baby I want it all
And I can't run away, don't know what to say or do anymore
Ha, ha, yo

[Verse 2]
She like "oh you so worried about getting broads and shit"
Comin' to my shows just to hear applause and shit
They get mad at me when the fans throw they bras and shit
Tryna tell me that it ain't part of my job descrip
I'm re-writing the history either way you interpret it
My life is like a circus the way these clowns have been surfacing
But you had my back, you memorized every word
Maybe bridges are meant to be burned
And when he gave you passes, I was gassed I can't lie
But I was busy living out my passions, that's why
My friend's just laugh, it's funny
The type of shit I'm mad at
90% is love, but all we hear is the bad
I wish I could take back the time we wasted talking 'bout you
I wish I could take back the time we wasted being mad
The funny thing about it's that I'm better off without you
It'd be worse if nothing changed, so now I'm glad
That I matter on my own
Yeah I matter on my own
Really out here on my own
And I just thought that you should know

[Hook]
Baby I want it all
Baby I want it all
And I can't run away, don't know what to say or do anymore
Oooh

[Bridge]
And I don't want to let this thing go
Cause they leaving me with nothing, nothing
Leaving me with nothing, nothing
On my own
I'd rather just watch it all grow
Cause at least I got something, something
100% of something, something
On my own

[Hook]
Baby I want it all
And I can't run away, don't know what to say or do anymore
Baby I want it all
Baby I want it all
And I can't run away, don't know what to say or do anymore
Oooh

[Outro]
Yo, you see this?
Hoodie just posted this number
No way, I thought I saw that
Is it legit?
Dude, let's fucking call
I wanna ask him if he'll ask Chelsea to go to prom with me
Do it from your phone, though
That'll be crazy
OK, OK. Alright, you got it? I got it
I'm dialing, dialing right now
Alright, alright
Are you doing it?
Put it on speaker
Here
