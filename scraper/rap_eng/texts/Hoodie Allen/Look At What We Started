[Intro]
Yea
Pep Rally
The Pep Rally
Time's up (up)

[Verse 1]
Let me turn the rally cap on and shit
Inside out
Everything I do is important
Meet a girl that's Natalie Portman
So everyday I feel like I'm fortunate
And more than, another man comes for the win
No tie like an ascot
All these people wanna be mascots
But I'm on fire, match box
That's why When I'm in the game
People wanna run around and just pass the rock
I got buzz for light years, aren't you the astronaut?
Well yea that's me Stock is up, S&P
Pop up on your browser like who Doogie Howser rips that beat
Ooo damn what it do now
But I never feel bad cause I'm overstated
They say that I talk a bunch
Well that's how Oprah made it
U.S. Open, played it
Made my racket, put your bracket on
When I'm in the league I'ma be the top seed
And compete for every single track I'm on
Green and Yellow jacket on, RJ make the masters
Yea I pray you like this, I don't need a pastor
Cause no elitist here, When I make the team I'ma lead the cheer
Hop up out that tunnel til I disappear like Casper

[Hook]
Look at what we started now
Make you a believer
We ain't ever done 'til we cleaning out the bleachers
Gym floor scuffed up stomping on my sneakers
Only thing you hear when we banging out the speakers
Is we started it, yeah, yeah, we started it
Ooo we started it, yeah, yeah, we started it
Ooo we started it, yeah, yeah, we started it
Ooo we started it

[Verse 2]
What you really got never off that beat
Hold this grand, Gotta keep grinding like coffee beans
Had a lot of people trying to come my way
But it never really mattered what they offered me
Office scene, Michael Scott
Wanna be the boss but I might just flop
Had a weird feeling in my gut that I didn't really like
So I had to go and knife it up
JK, I could wife you up
Promise I ain't trippin'
Hoodie Van Halen baby I am always riffin'
That music go off of my dome
Just like time I'm off it alone
Off on his own
But no Kevin McCallister
Shadowing myself like an avatar
Wait wait
Nobody wants an amateur
So I keep, keep, keep, keep at it
Til I'm Dwight Howard status
Just the center of this magic
Just the senate I could draft it and politic the lobbyist
Ooo ain't it obvious that Hoodie just came around and bodied shit
Bed, bath, not a twist
Steadfast not a quick
Serve, but I got me Mandy Moore Andy Roddick shit
Met a genie gotta wish that this gonna be our season
Selling out the seats for a reason
Come and see

[Hook]

[Outro]
I'm in the zone
That Hoodie zone
