[Intro: Amir Blumenfield]
Three wishes genie? Nah, I only need one;
One punch, one hunch
I spit fire and I never start over
Sorry- lemme start over
Le- lemme start over

[Chorus: Hoodie Allen]
I only got three wishes tonight
I'm so cold, I'm covered in Aardvark Cum
Cold girl yeah I wish a had a blanket for warmth
I don't know, why didn't 'cha...  [?]
I'm so hard done
... [?]
