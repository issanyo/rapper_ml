[Verse 1]
When it's late and i miss you
And i'm sleepless in stand still
And i wonder if you are in love
Or if you are still thinking about me
Cause it's late and i miss when
You were here in my bed still
With your mouth on my neck
And your hands on my waist
And my hands on your body

[Chorus]
So tell me it's not, tell me it's not, oh, tell me it's over
So tell me it's not, tell me it's not and you're coming over
Tell me it's not, tell me it's not, oh, tell me it's over
And you're coming over

[Verse 2]
I'm thinking too much and i miss you, i miss you, i miss you
I miss you in the morning
I tried to replace it, i miss you, i miss you, i miss you
I miss being important
My body is wasted on these conversations, i hate it
You make me wanna forget
And I've been too honest
Cause honestly all that i
Want is to feel important

[Chorus]
So tell me it's not, tell me it's not, oh, tell me it's over
So tell me it's not, tell me it's not and you're coming over
Tell me it's not, tell me it's not, oh, tell me it's over
And you're coming over

[Bridge: TYLERxCORDY]
Too much, she on too much
Obsessed with being obsessed, not being in love
Being backlit by fireworks and drugs
Being passionate about everything but us
And now I'm hands-up in the hallway
Elevator fights spilling into streets all day
2nd ave with the bad habit, you, yeah
Second chance but I'm still bad at truth, yeah
Tit for tat but we always end up back here
Hungover in the deli, going halves for the cashier
Can't tell if I'm over you, man, I might call
I miss you in the morning and even more when night falls

[Chorus]
So tell me it's not, tell me it's not, oh, tell me it's over
So tell me it's not, tell me it's not and you're coming over
Tell me it's not, tell me it's not, oh, tell me it's over
And you're coming over
