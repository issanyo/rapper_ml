I just had a dream, I could be a grownup
Friends telling me I'mma pop like soda
Wild summer night while some of y'all woulda known
That a kid like moi would've blown up
Chilling out East, got a rock Lola
Only family matters like I'm Carl Winslow but
Pop in the road trip, I got the windows low shit
We doin' this for kicks I'm Matt Stover
When that's over I don't want a quick ending
Money's so cool why you quit that spending
Girls do yoga they just split and bending
If you act this sinister then quit pretending
Oh that's offending me, why don't you cover up
Cause I could show you to my room, get you bundled up
She took a look into my pocket, got a hundred bucks
I crash landed in the country club cause I got

Friends in the bay, friends in the Hamptons
All I got to say to them is thank God for that
And we could party all damn day and the last one to stay awake
Thank God for my friends in the bay, friends in the Hamptons
All I got to say to them is I'm on the map
Thank God for that

Say we in the house, eating up the Dominoes
Living at the top of the world, geronimo
What the fuck we do last night, Donna knows
Man I think I'm heading for a fall like a domino
Someone pick me up or they kicking me down
I don't usually score so here's the rebound
Woody Harrelson I kept my feet on the ground
But me and RJF are really in the league now
With no beach house, just a sand bucket we could shovel dreams
Or we could hitchhike and make it by other means
But if I sit tight, I'm sinking the submarine
And sipping bubbles I'd just rather sip the bubbly
Yes, so let the chef cook the souffle
Eating food and liquor with my food and liquor, Lupe
Who'd a pick a better opportunity than a new day
Bitches trying to grab me a bouquet cause I got
