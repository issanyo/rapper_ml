[Intro]
Hoodie...

[Verse 1]
Yeah and I swear to never let this moment pass me
I give'em my all on these tracks like an athlete
Made it to the pros and they salary capped me
Mom said I should of stayed in school, Degrassi
Sorry Drizzy, I just made it to the college path
But things ain't even adding up like it was college math
So give me a minute to figure and I'll holla back
Where the nonbelievers, fuck'em, I never acknowledge that
Knockin' on the door, Jehovah's my witness
And I'm forever goin' 'til Hova will witness
I'm over my business, I'm entrepreneur shit
Cause she's my investment and damn it is gorgeous
Can't get caught up in this world but I love it
A lot of people throwing in they hands like they're puppets
All that shit changed when the drum kicks
Shia Lebouf, transforming what we do into dumb hits

[Hook]
You know that I gotta go chasin' my dream
Been doing it big since I was a teen
Moving way too fast for y'all to stop me
Oh, not me, oh, oh, not me (2x)

I never can say goodbye
No, no, no, I
I never can say goodbye

[Verse 2]
Look, I'm being honest, sometimes it's easy to burn out
When you don't really know how the future will turn out
I'be been in school so the one that I learn now
Is all the work I puttin' in will equal what I earn out
And that's just economics in the perfect universe
A place where every girl I meet is saying "you the first"
And the crowd is singing with me like they knew the verse
Thank the law for gravity, it's grabbin' me unto the earth
So even though I really wanna be a star sun
I can't ever leave my town like a pardon
Beause it made me who I am, bar none
Tell Long Island I'ma burn it down like our sun
So we can raise it back up like it's our son
Make'em play our song everyday like it's Carson
Came along way but I still feel far
I hope they understand how real we are

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
You know the feeling with the buzz on vibrate
Spanish girls say I'm one fine hombre
What could be better than this baby cause I'm great
Take'em out to dinner, it didn't matter if I'm late
Cause y'all wait, I don't even play son
Ain't no competition I got the race one
Haters wanna shoot me down with they ray guns
I'll pull out the Ray Bands, you ain't gonna say none

[Hook]
