[Verse 1: MAX]
I gave you all my loving
Offers I had a dozen
But I ain't give 'em nothin' never, do you like that?
But then I caught you creeping
Secrets that you were keeping
Like every other weekend
Why you do me like that?

[Pre-Chorus: MAX]
So now you say you take it all back
Yeah, that don't mean jack
Cause I know the facts
I swear you must be smoking that crack
I'm dipping so fast
Yeah, I don't need that

[Chorus: MAX]
Now you're running your mouth
But there's nothing that can slow me down
You're messing around
Got me thinking that it's time you go
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Cause I'm not listening, no
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
I see you move your lips, but it sounds like gibberish

[Post-Chorus]
Ou shilibo shilibo naow middi middi
Ou shilibo shilibo naow (Gibberish)
Ou shilibo shilibo naow middi middi
Ou shilibo shilibo naow

[Verse 2: MAX]
I don't need to recover
Rising way up above ya
Go run and tell your mother
Why you do me like that
Good luck with all the others
Don't care about the number
You all deserve each other
Why you do me like that

[Pre-Chorus: MAX]
So now you say you take it all back
Yeah, that don't mean jack
Cause I know the facts
I swear you must be smoking that crack
I'm dipping so fast
Yeah, I don't need that

[Chorus: MAX]
Now you're running your mouth
But there's nothing that can slow me down
You're messing around
Got me thinking that it's time you go
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Cause I'm not listening, no
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
I see you move your lips, but it sounds like gibberish

[Post-Chorus]
Ou shilibo shilibo naow middi middi
Ou shilibo shilibo naow (Gibberish)
Ou shilibo shilibo naow middi middi
Ou shilibo shilibo naow (Gibberish)

[Verse 3: Hoodie Allen]
These girls like to talk, wait a minute I'm talking back (Shh)
Say that she wanted to love me forever, but I was just trying to smash
First date and I'm taking her back
Bought herself a ring, I didn't take her to Jared's
Russell Wilson and she'll be making a pass
We just met, but I think she arranging a marriage
Like, stop, just hold up
Not the type to get hopes up
I go hard like I'm supposed to
But you back down like a post up
Oh wait, is that my poster?
Album signed by Yours Truly
I swear you said that you don't know me
But girl it looks like you kinda knew me
Oh shit, obsessed, but I'm already undressed
Already got like 99 problems, and I ain't trying to confess
I did my best to move away
But she followed me with that bouquet
So I shaved my head, bought a toupee
But she too smart like Lupe

[Chorus: MAX]
So now you're running your mouth
But there's nothing that can slow me down (There's nothing that can)
You're messing around
Got me thinking that it's time you go
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh (It's time to go, it's time to go)
Cause I'm not listening, no
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh (I'm not listening, I ain't listening)
I see you move your lips, but it sounds like gibberish

[Post-Chorus]
Ou shilibo shilibo naow middi middi (Oh oh)
Ou shilibo shilibo naow (Gibberish)
Ou shilibo shilibo naow middi middi (Oh oh)
Ou shilibo shilibo naow (Gibberish)
Ou shilibo shilibo naow middi middi
Ou shilibo shilibo naow (Gibberish)
Ou shilibo shilibo naow middi middi (I see you talkin', baby)
Ou shilibo shilibo naow (But it sounds like gibberish)
