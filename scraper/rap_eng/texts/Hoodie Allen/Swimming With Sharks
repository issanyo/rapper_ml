[Intro]
Yeah!
Yo, you know we had to come from overseas on this one
It's Hoodie Allen
On this beat beat-down
Say what up to VV Brown
Y'all let's get loud
R.J. drop it

[Verse 1: Hoodie Allen]
Yeah, I gotta shorten up my words cause I speak fast
Girls got me caught up like a recap
She's always high scorin', nobody can beat that
But talk's cheap, so consider this my free rap
A free app, but nothing is free really
There's a shark in the water, I'm ready to free Willy
Why so serious? Better we be silly
'Less she turn a cold shoulder, I'm ready to be chilly
Damn, let's work it out girl, this is gym class
Let me tell you 'bout the game like Jim Nantz
Cuz there's a whole lotta fishes that I swim past
But I can't wait to drop, Slim Fast
Thin glass between us I did my best to break
I was so convinced that I let the rest debate
I known a lot of girls, always said it best to wait
I never been a Snoop, dog, don't investigate

[Hook: VV Brown]
When I'm in doubt
I open my mouth
And words come out
Words come out like

[Hoodie Allen]
We good, we get it
We love where we headed
So we live to regret it
We don't ever care, we
We don't ever care

[Verse 2: Hoodie Allen]
We met in Vegas, so that explains it, I rolled the dice
Saw the writings on the wall like I'm notified
We sayin' no to fights, always acting so polite
But now you're cursin' me out, okay, that's poltergeist
Okay, it's no surprise, name change, pronto
Just cuz I'm a rapper that don't mean I'm in Toronto
'96 Honda with a drive like Rondo
If I'm racin' for your heart I'll never tie like kwon-do
Yeah, you get Mad Men, so that's advertised
But who's the illest, 'that's me," like Amanda Bynes
So if you gold diggin', don't worry I handle mines
I let you paint the picture vivid you've been vandalized
Cuz I'm a male, I'm a man, I be Karl Malone
I done some good deeds, I'm leavin' the karma 'lone
So if you would, please, don't leave this bar alone
We got far to go but we never far from home
Oh

[Hook]
