[Verse 1]
It's the same diff'
When I meet a girl that's so out of this world
I need a spaceship
We can put it all together, that's make-shift
But I don't ever make moves, only make hits
I'm on the fame cliff
Can't die, just save me
Big money budget, I love it like Sam Raimi
Never a contestant number and you'll never play me
I'd rather be the host, Chelsea Lately
So I'm feeling like Hercules
And if looks could steal, this would be a burglary
Took the wheel and looking like she hurting me
But I ain't trying to get burned to the 3rd degree
And it's hard when she's saying what she'd do to me
Joel McHale, she up in my Community
Turn me on, they turn on me like mutiny
But I'll be living in a land of opportunity
So say word

[Hook] x2
Oh yeah, the drink's on me
We can mess around if you stay low key
All these other women say they know me
But shh..

Tighten up
Just tighten up

[Verse 2]
And we stay down
When I see kids
I remember when we lived on the playground
Now we living in the sky cause we plane-bound
But I don't ever break rules, only break sound
I'm on my take-out
Can't choose, just try me
Big money budget, a little bit like Pat Riley
I ain't never ball but these labels still wanna sign me
I'd rather not talk, insert smiley
You're too good for me, it's no question
So I came into your dorm like a freshman
Tell them I ain't trying to leave through the exit
Because I dream big, let me Inception
So my head spin, we don't even break dance
And I don't care what you're doing, don't make plans
Crowd flipping, I'm thinking we got a keg stand
Every time I'm making my music
I know I make fans

[Hook] x2

[Verse 3]
And we stand back
Try to live a life
That might never arrive like the Amtrak
And so many people want it that it's jam-packed
So I be giving them some more like a graham cracker
Understand that
Can't stop, just hold me
Big money budget, a little bit like Bon Jovi
Heating up the track so we'll never be getting cold feet
Going for the gold, Shaq and Kobe
Stay good like a charity
And I won't ever get drained like a battery
But I do beat up the beat like battery
Oh you love the double-meaning, don't flatter me
And if girls get really messy, they Tara Reid
I read their mind, tarot read
Cards get drawn lights get on
'Til I'm revving up the engine on the Camry
You say

[Hook] x2
