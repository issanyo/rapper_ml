[Intro]
Yeah

[Verse 1]
I got a fake ID and a checklist
It goes never meet a girl on Craigslist
And never spend your money on a necklace
3 square meals, homie gotta have breakfast
Real shit, she be payin' for the date
I be on my Will Smith, Enemy of State
Keep my friends close, keep my enemies away
And if they own repellent, uh, they so jealous
I'mma do shit to just piss them off
Say you never heard me, it's your loss
They bitin' all my freestyles
They told me make my money frontin' on that weed style
I tell 'em I'm too old for it
And I gave my brother my ID
She independent, bet these bitches never find me
I hope they don't find him though
Cause they be knockin' on my door
Now they lookin' through my window

[Hook]
Tell me what you really want from me
Point blank, no discussion
Closed mouth, closed mouth, ow
I'll give it to you, no interruption
And tell me one time that you want me
I promise that I won't say nothin'
Sh-shut it up sh-sh-shut it up
I'll give it to you, no interruption
In your home, in your home oh
On the phone, on the phone
All alone, all alone oh
I'll give it to you no interruption
In your house, in your house oh
On the couch, on the couch
Name the time and the place and the function
And I'll give it to you, no interruption

[Verse 2]
Talkin' money, I don't really give an F man
I got power like a motherfuckin' X-Man
Married to the game, but I'd rather be the best man
You be on that same shit, all day, s-pin
Brand new kicks, why you shoppin' at a Payless
Do it on my first take, skippin' all the Bayless
See me, you could be me but I end up on the A-List
I'm chillin' with Rihanna in the K-K-Caymans
I'm just kiddin', I'm a white kid, hi kids
Anderson Silva, I hit him with the high kicks
Never been realer, you nothin' but a side kick
Oh you on MySpace? That used to be my shit
So who's killin' the game, who's the culprit
I be workin' like I'm Anders Holmvik
Now I got a bunch of new friends, and they all rich
Got blazers, Aldridge

[Hook]
Tell me what you really want from me
Point blank, no discussion
Closed mouth, closed mouth, ow
I'll give it to you, no interruption
And tell me one time that you want me
I promise that I won't say nothin'
Sh-shut it up sh-sh-shut it up
I'll give it to you, no interruption
In your home, in your home oh
On the phone, on the phone
All alone, all alone oh
I'll give it to you no interruption
In your house, in your house oh
On the couch, on the couch
Name the time and the place and the function
And I'll give it to you, no interruption

[Bridge]
I know it's hard to give you everything you want from me
When I'm running on empty
(I'm running, I'm running, I'm running)
I know it's hard to be the type of dude you want to be
Cause your girlfriend wanted me, yeah

[Hook]
In your home, in your home oh
On the phone, on the phone
All alone, all alone oh
I'll give it to you, no interruption
In your house, in your house oh
On the couch, on the couch
Name the time and the place and the function
I'll give it to you, no interruption
