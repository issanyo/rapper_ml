Yeah!
Yo, you know we had to come from overseas on this one!
It's Hoodie Allen
On this beat-beat down
Say what up to VV Brown
Y'all let's get loud
R.J. drop, man

Yeah, I gotta shorten up my words cuz I speak fast
Girls got me caught up like a re-cast
She's always high strung, nobody can beat that
But talk's cheap, so consider this my free rap
A free app, but nothing is free really
There's a shark in the water, I'm ready to free Willy
Why so serious? Better we be silly
'Less you turn a cold shoulder, I'm ready to be chilly
Damn, let's work it out girl, this is gym class
Let me tell you 'bout the game like gymnast
Cuz there's a whole lotta fishes that I swim past
But I can't wait to drive slim fast
Thin glass between us I did my best to break
I was so convinced that I let the rest to bake
I known a lot of girls, always said it best to wait
I never been a snoop, dog
Don't investigate

When I'm in doubt
I open my mouth
And words come out
Words come out like
Words come out like

We good, we get it
We love, we headed
Til we live, to regret it
We don't ever care, we
We don't ever care

We met in Vegas, so that explains it, I rolled the dice
Saw the writings on the wall like I'm notified
We sayin' no to fights, always acting so polite
But now you're cursin' me out, okay, that's poltergeist
Okay, it's no surprise, name change, pronto
Just cuz I'm a rapper that don't mean I'm in Toronto
'96 Honda with a drive like Rondo
If I'm racin' for your heart I'll never tie like kwon-do
Yeah, you get mad men, so that's advertised
But who's the illest, that's me like (?)
So if you gold diggin', don't worry I handle mine's
I let you paint the picture vivid you've been vandalized
Cuz I'm a male, I'm a man, I be (?)
I done some good deeds, I'm (?)
So if you would, please, don't leave this bar alone
We got far to go but we never far from home
I done some good deeds

When I'm in doubt
I open my mouth
And words come out
Words come out like

We good, we get it
We love, we headed
Til we live, to regret it
We don't ever care, we
We don't ever care
