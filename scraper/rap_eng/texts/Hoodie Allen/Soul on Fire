Uh

[Hook]
Hands up
Put them high to the sky
Let me set your soul on fire tonight
Not-not we not trying to fight
Let me set your soul on fire tonight
We live fast, ain't time for waking up
I make time, then we be breaking up
So ask God "Give me one more try"
Let me set your soul on fire

[Verse 1]
Uh
She said it's her time
I asked "When's mine?"
Said "Boy I'm trying to win all your money like Ben Stein"
So I just circled back, I built them the venn di-
You know the figure, that figures that got every man lying
And every girl cheats a little, both of us then try
To cover up, but you would rather pull a LeAnn Rimes
So fuck it I bailed
Yup, let me leave for the night though
Room full of nice suits, American Psycho
Aight though
Let me say a toast, pull the glasses out
Now pour the gasoline, put the fucking matches out
I asked her where to sleep
She pointed "That's the couch"
I heard it on the street and I ain't had to ask around
Cause news travels real fast around these parts
So if you jump the gun, you're never getting a restart
You say that love is fun, you must have been a retard
We only looking for somewhere to be part, until we're on fire

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Rolling out of my bed, taking longer than I'm supposed to
With so many girls that acting like they already home, so
You ever see a model in the morning, get your hopes up
She went from Heidi Klum, into hide the close-ups
And now that I'm assume everybody taking posters and glamour shots
You're turning fake the second they turn the camera on
Waitresses waiting for their break like Cameron Diaz
We spaz on tracks I like to yammer on
We bad, like Mike, I'm the King of the Camelot
We grab every chance, somehow now we man, LeBron
Feed that, uh
There's too much heat up in the Amazon
Be that as may I'm coming back like I never won
Trophies as a kid, there ain't no room to make my shelf fit
Just because I want it all doesn't mean I'm selfish
Never really listened to my eardrums melted
Uh, Van Gogh, Van Kicks, Van Pelt
That's fire

[Hook]

Hands up, put them
Hands up, put them
Hands up, put them high to the sky

(I ... I'mma set your soul on fire)
(Let me set your soul on fire)
