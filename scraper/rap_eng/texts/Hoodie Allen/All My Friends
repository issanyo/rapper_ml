[Chorus: State Champs]
All my friends think I got money now
And their girlfriends think that I’m funny now
It’s like all they ever talk about
You knew me then but you don’t know me now

[Verse 1: Hoodie Allen]
Yeah, and this one's for the people who were with me before I ever had a dollar in my bank account
And for the girls who had hit me on
Even gotta buy a drink for ‘em to be makin’ out
It’s real love, real friends, yeah I never separate it homie
I am on my Kevin Bacon
I used to tell ‘em we’ll be travellin’ ‘round the world
Playin’ shows, one day, now we celebratin’
It’s me and Conan on TV
Mama I did it, shouts to Bella and Gigi
I need a new Lamborghini
I need some girls in bikinis
I got like so many wishes
I think I might need a Genie
I roll the weed up in the Uber X
Tell ‘em hold up, let me hit you with the new address
And we partyin’ from Brooklyn all the way to Budapest
So I’ma do me, you can do the rest

[Chorus: State Champs]
All my friends think I got money now
And their girlfriends think that I’m funny now
It’s like all they ever talk about
You knew me then but you don’t know me now

[Verse 2: Hoodie Allen]
Yeah, and this is for the friends who ain’t really friends
Let me break it down here’s the definition
If you weren't around on the underground
When it all went down, why you reminiscin’?
And all the people talkin’ in my ear (shhh)
I ain’t tryna hear, man it ain’t convincin’
I be lookin’ at my brand new watch
And it says “Oh gosh, time to pay attention”
So we don’t ever do it at a deficit
Hella big, all my, all my budget’s like an elephant
I remember when we did it for the hell of it
Independent, invented a way to end the payin’ of the rent
And now that I got my momma back in the crib
I can start to pay it back for all the things that she did
And when they ask me if I like how I live
I say I’d do it all again ‘cause

[Chorus: State Champs]
All my friends think I got money now
And their girlfriends think that I’m funny now
It’s like all they ever talk about
You knew me then but you don’t know me now

[Bridge: State Champs]
Some things changed in everyone
I thought this was meant to be fun
I’m fed up and I’m movin’ on
You stay home, sayin’ what you want
It don’t mean nothing to me, yeah

[Chorus: State Champs]
All my friends think I got money now
And their girlfriends think that I’m funny now (think that I'm funny now)
It’s like all they ever talk about (all they talk about)
You knew me then but you don’t know me now

[Outro: State Champs]
Oh oh oh, oh
(Champs, Hoodie)
They don’t know me now
(For Albany, NYC)
They don’t know nothing
(That's a beautiful job)
They don’t know nothing
You knew me then but you don’t know me now
