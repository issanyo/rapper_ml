[Chorus: Goody Grace]
Heartbreak
I try to play it off sometimes
But you always got me going out my mind
When you call me
Cause you keep on ringing me just to keep bringing me down
Heartbreak
Cause you keep on ringing me just to keep bringing me down

[Verse 1: Hoodie Allen]
Now you're tryna wife a girl who's only looking for money
Cause ain't nobody really tryna go broke in their twenties
They say it's all about chemistry
Looks fade eventually
Will you still have sex with me?
Like, even when we're 70?
Will you remember me when we're losing our memory
And let me answer all the questions first when watching Jeopardy?
Saying "I love you", that's sort of a giant step to me
So when I say that shit, I don't mean it passive-aggressively
I'm tryna lock you up, girl - felony
She hotter than wings without the celery
I know it's kinda crazy that love's turned us to enemies
I'm chasing after you, but you're always a step ahead of me
That's why you give me

[Chorus: Goody Grace]
Heartbreak
I try to play it off sometimes
But you always got me going out my mind
When you call me
Cause you keep on ringing me just to keep bringing me down
Heartbreak
Cause you keep on ringing me just to keep bringing me down
Heartbreak

[Verse 2: Hoodie Allen]
Hey yo I'm searching for the type of love you see in the movies
But now I'm playing shows, signing some boobies
I think she feels a little
(Heartbreak)
Like a roomie
She's sleeping next to me, but not speaking to me
I got a hang it up
Cause this ain't really working out
Like if we fighting every day, is it worth it now?
I'll even take you to Urban Outfitters and leave you in the dressing room, you ain't coming out with us, so baby, meet me in the mall
It's going down
Meet me in the club
It's going down
You call me 'round 2 after your night's through
Baby, don't mistake me for another nice dude you'll be ending up with

[Chorus: Goody Grace]
Heartbreak
I try to play it off sometimes
But you always got me going out my mind
When you call me
Cause you keep on ringing me just to keep bringing me down
Heartbreak
Cause you keep on ringing me just to keep bringing me down
Heartbreak
