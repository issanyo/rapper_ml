Do you believe?
Do you believe?
Do you believe things gon' be alright?
Every time? (But everytime, yeah)
Do you believe?
Do you believe?
Do you believe you'll be by my side?
Every night?
Oh-ah oh-ah oh-ay

[Verse 1]
Yo, I been rapping since Allen Iverson skippin' practice
So many hooks on my records how could I not be captain
Indian gave you attention, now I gotta take it back man
'Cause I ran over all your fans, aka your fraction
I hear my music in traffic, dog I’m radioactive
They got my homies reminiscing, like back when
Nobody love me they were only actin'
Now I'm out for the blood, on my Anna Paquin
People keep talking, we finally doing numbers
I’m tryna be Donald Glover by the end of the summer
Anything less is a bummer, I won’t be satisfied
'Til I see my name in shining lights, plus I'm shining like
Jack Nicholson sitting court side with the shades
Used to be so high up in the crowd I couldn’t see the game
Dreaming of the day when I finally quit my day job
Look how far we came dog, hard work finally paid off

[Hook]
Do you believe?
Do you believe?
Do you believe things gon' be alright?
Every time? (But everytime, yeah)
Do you believe?
Do you believe?
Do you believe you'll be by my side?
Every night?
Oh-ah oh-ah oh-ay

[Verse 2]
Yeah, your boy got faith like I'm George Michael in Limp Bizkit
This life's great and my friends told me "Do not risk it"
It ain't worth it, these pipe dreams can be so distant
It's like I'm Lloyd Christmas, I guess I gotta be dumb to look at my choices and try to act like I'm not priviledged
I'm gunslinging so don't tell me I am not driven
'Cause while most of my friends are tryna pay they student loans
I just write this rappin', already pay my future home
Plus I'm what your girl is looking for, I don't mean Google Chrome
Need some inspiration, my motivation's to prove you wrong
I never beat around the bush, this ain't skull and bones
The prince of Manhattan is finally back to reclaim the throne
Driving through the city in my El Dorado
Plus my girl look like a young Winona, she a super model
I just keep it real, all these rappers other wives on Bravo
Went from havin' nada now I'm feeling like I won the lotto
Do you believe?

[Hook]
Do you believe?
Do you believe?
Do you believe things gon' be alright?
Every time? (But everytime, yeah)
Do you believe?
Do you believe?
Do you believe you'll be by my side?
Every night?
Oh-ah oh-ah oh-ay
