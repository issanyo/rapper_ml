[Intro: Hoodie Allen]
I don't wanna give you up
I just wanna give you love
I don't wanna make it tough
Cause you don't wanna do too much
I don't want to say good-bye
I just want to stay the night
Show me what you are made of
Show me what you are made of

[Verse 1: Hoodie Allen]
Yo, making out on my tour bus
So fresh probably thought it was a Corvette
And if you are wondering why your girl ain't making plans with you
Well mothafucka she ignored them (fuck her, she ignored them)
#SheWasHangingWithARapperNow
Remember when you were the shit, Manny Pacquiao
Things change so fast now a days cause you used to front hard
Now you are super good at backing out
One shot, two shot, now you are blacking out
Think you fucking with the king, what's your rationale
I'll be coming for the title, tell your girl to come over
She will be missing all the finals (she be missing all her finals)
I'm gonna teach you a thing or two
What's a fling for me,its probably a ring for you
I got Mary, Megan, Mindy, Morgan, I'ma smash em'...Billy Corgan
(Shwoop)

[Hook: Hoodie Allen]
I don't wanna give you up
I just wanna give you love
I don't wanna make it tough
Cause you don't wanna do too much
I don't want to say good-bye
I just want to stay the night
Show me what you are made of (Show me what you are made of)
Show me what you are made of (Show me what you are made of)
You don't gotta to turn me down
I'll come in when no one is home
Baby let me turn you on
Treat you like a new iPhone
Girl you could be a star, fuck that you cause already are
Show me what you are made of (Show me what you are made of)
Show me what you are made of

[Verse 2: Hoodie Allen]
Yo, Ray Allen in the 90s cause I got game
Two girls in my hotel and I'm not paying
She wanted to know my occupay
I said, I make money money make money money, hey
Like I rob banks, Uncle Phil Dough
Come to my place if you want a real show
She got me feeling like a Magic Mike
You're a beauty girl, tell me what the pageant is like
Skinny chick with a booty and got an appetite
If she catch me looking at it, I just act polite (like)
(like)
Yo what a conundrum, bitches are punch drunk
Love like Floyd Mayweather, just pumped em
Full of some Russian vodka
She said she out of my league like the Brooklyn Dodgers
Everyone tryin' to be the MVP
I take your girl from courtside to show her the lockers, ugh

[Hook: Hoodie Allen]
I don't wanna give you up
I just wanna give you love
I don't wanna make it tough
Cause you don't wanna do too much
I don't want to say good-bye
I just want to stay the night

(Show me what you are made of)
Show me what you are made of
(Show me what you are made of)
You don't gotta to turn me down
I'll come in when no one is home
Baby let me turn you on
Treat you like a new iPhone
Girl you could be a star, fuck that you cause already are
Show me what you are made of
(Show me what you are made of)
Show me what you are made of

I do what I ever want
