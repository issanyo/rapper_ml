[Verse 1]
My family don't see me more, thats growing up
And now they call me the c4, I'm blowing up
So if you sitting on seesaws you going up
Some people get going, but I love it when the goings tough
Too young to know enough
Too old to play the part
Too cool for showing up
Too dumb to say whats smart
So I'm a substitute waiting for the game to start
But I ain't trying to get played like Change of Heart
Chuck Woolery I hope to rip this stage apart and hopefully
You are ready to admit that I have made my mark
And may I park and find me another ride
I'm letting Florence tell you how I feel inside

Joy and Misery
Joy and Misery
Joy and Misery

[Verse 2]
Hello world, nice to meet you I am Cory Matthews
People wanna say I've been blessed like atchew
So now I'm using my attitude just to act through
Not a bad do got me covered like a tat-too
So where I'm at?
Moved away from home
Where these people that are known wanna comment how I grown
And they offer they opinion on my life and how it's gone
All the while I'm highin' in a robe, elsewhere
Hah, and I don't need no help there
Reaching in my pocket like I needed the welfare
Can't stand the heat get out or I'll melt there
They say you won't never get it like health care but I'm feeling great

[Hook]
