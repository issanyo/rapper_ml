(Uno dos tres, uno uno dos tres)

[Verse 1: Hoodie Allen]
I got these bitches looking at me crazy
The way I work gon' make these other rappers lazy
You keep talking all that talk 'cuz none of that shit phase me
Mother's love me too, they probably bought my shit at Macy's
Hold up babe let me talk for a minute
Never took a deal, what they offering in it?
I don't really care 'cuz I'm all independent
I'm an arrogant American nobody is comparing him –
To Eminem until they heard me flip it like I'm Kerrigan –
And now they ready for it from Long Island out to Maryland
I got a bunch of people singing with me like they're caroling
I'm damn witty, you seem impressed
Yo can you hear me? That's so so def
I'm so so blessed, don't need plans 'cuz I'm so so next
Steve Young flow ‘cuz I go so left
When I dive in the record better hold your breath like *gasp*
I'm a find you a cab
Go home with a bad bitch and leave her man with the tab
You'll still be there when I'm back
'Cuz she in love with my rap songs
I'm trying to live forever 'cuz today don't feel like that long

[Hook: Travis Garland]
Yeah, ain't worried about my problems tonight
'Cuz we'll deal with that shit in the morning
Anywhere you wanna go, baby we can take it slow
I just wanna live in the moment
Just wanna live in the moment
You barely live in the moment
Anywhere you wanna go, baby you should let me know
Maybe you can live in my moment

(Uno dos tres, uno uno dos tres)

[Verse 2: Hoodie Allen]
So many people out here acting selfish
They talking at me like they sorry they can't help it
I said “no worries get that money in a hurry”
Cuz I know that clock is ticking to the minute you ain't selling (nah)
G-d damn I don't think you eating
Got a bowl of Wheaties in my kitchen if I need it I'm a make you feel defeated
Probably hang with JT, bet it that he'll hate me –
--If I tell him that he should go back to "Senorita"
I could probably brag a bit about taking your girl and shit
But it was pretty easy based on the way that you treat her
So do you fam, talk big game
Real life you got a small role, Ving Rhames
Making out with your girl 'cuz I spit game
We could do it on the couch like Rick James
Five fingers to the face shit, it's not basic
I been pacing and been waiting for that opportun—
Say goodbye to your afternoon
Stay at home 'cuz I stay at home, All that Jazz like K. Malone
Girl tell me that she came alone, Got a different meaning, I ain't saying mo'
I'm out of lines and you out of time like Billy Crystal don't analyze me
Only got one life to live and I guarantee we gonna live it wisely

[Hook: Travis Garland]
Yeah, ain't worried about my problems tonight
'Cuz we'll deal with that shit in the morning
Anywhere you wanna go, baby we can take it slow
I just wanna live in the moment
Just wanna live in the moment
You barely live in the moment
Anywhere you wanna go, baby you should let me know
Maybe you can live in my moment
