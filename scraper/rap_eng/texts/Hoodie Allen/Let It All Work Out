[Intro]
Your heart pounds with precision, a king dies inside his courts
Your heart pounds with precision, a king dies inside these doors
Let it all work out (x 4)

[Verse 1: Hoodie Allen]
She ask me when you coming to my college
Cause she's all about it
I said that's 40,000
Dollars she ain't got em
She begs her parents constantly
She got A's in all her classes but I know she wants the D
Look at your kid do the math
Running over the game while you're taking a nap
Vehicular manslaughter when they gimme the rap
Probably gonna need a miracle to mirror you back
Make fans, move units, Tim Taylor, that's home improvement
Cameras follow me everywhere but don’t call me truman
Resume is like a Rubik's Cube cause it's hard to use and I'm hardly using my brain
Fans screamin my name dog well that feelings always insane
The band wagon bout to leave the station, so hop it on to that train
Always motivated by love
Never motivated by fame
Blink once, it's like "what's my age", they stressin off of my accolades
People tellin me I'm doin great, but honestly I just can’t relate
And I'm going through some shit that got me stressin out
But like my homies told me

[Chorus: Sampha]
Let it all work out (x8)

[Verse 2: Hoodie Allen]
Let me..
Be the guy that I'm suppose to
The person I envisioned
The boy who be all like I told ya
My dream keeps gettin bigger and every year I get older’
Somehow got my diploma
And now I own it like Oprah
Sorry I ain’t fo shit, the minute
With all these bridges, sometimes I get tunnel vision
I’m thinking how I’m bout to cross some long division
Only 5’9 but in the center on position
But I been in the game and I came to ball
Sent one tweet like "I came to the mall"
Hundred motherfuckers gonna show right up
Tried that shit in Oklahoma City it was loud as fuck
Mothers dropped they daughters off
Now they got me runnin' like we never shut the water off
Homie take this quarter off
I throw your ass some Gatorade
Always been a free agent but know my team they came to play
It could be one against a hundred
I promise they'll never stress me out
Cause like my homies told me

[Chorus]
Let it all work out (x8)

[Outro]
Ya know they say like
99% of the things we worry about everyday don't even happen
So I'm gonna spend all that extra time
Fuckin' yo bitch
Woop
And when I'm done
We both can go to Applebee's
I tell her "You can get whatever you want"
She want that appetizer sampler
You can't get that sampler but I got it
I got em like that
Bitch have all of the buffalo wings you want
Next song...
