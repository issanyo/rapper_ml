[Chorus]
Runnin' runnin' runnin'
These circles 'round you (all night)
When I get to where I'm going
I will be (alright)
'Cause I've made mistakes but I've changed my ways
That's done, I'm back to square one

[Verse 1]
I don't got it all figured out yet
I take it day to day like my outfit
And music is my outlet, used to do it just for me and now a days it's crowded
So I skipped that gym membership
Only time I'm flexing is when I work my penmanship
The mind of a perfectionist, but now a days I appreciate the blemishes
I relish the opportunity to be a better man, be a better son, better brother, be a better fan
Work a hundred thousand hours, give a part to Uncle Sam
But I don't regret it 'cause the other half is who I am
So I don't ever slow down, stop signs is my enemy
Too much driving, never letting you ahead of me
Tryna reminisce, I'm tryna make new memories

[Chorus x2]
Runnin' runnin' runnin'
These circles 'round you (all night)
When I get to where I'm going
I will be (alright)
'Cause I've made mistakes but I've changed my ways
That's done, I'm back to square one

[Verse 2]
And I was sitting in my '97 Honda that my mama said that I probably shoulda never bought
I got a couple speeding tickets 'cause my mom was always thinking way ahead of what these people thought
They told me I was too ambitious, told me I'm unrealistic
Told me I could never have it all
But if I follow what you follow
Chances are I probably still working at the fucking mall
So don't tell me to dream small
You probably catch me climbing up your nearest bean stalk
Whole gang with me, but we never sea walk[?]
Going long on the green, like I'm about to tee off
There is a million ways to make it in this life
So let me hit you with a little piece of advice
If you ain't doing something everyday that makes you feel alive
You should find a better way to spend all your frickin' time

[Chorus x2]
Runnin' runnin' runnin'
These circles 'round you (all night)
When I get to where I'm going
I will be (alright)
'Cause I've made mistakes but I've changed my ways
That's done, I'm back to square one
