[Verse 1]
Ask me what it feel like
Staring at a sky so vanilla
Tellin' Kurt Russell
"Homie this ain't real life"
I'll be making good on my promises
Honesty is confidence
Lot of it is missing but I realize
I could be better than I was
Lighter on my feet
Cookin up this soul
When we fire up the beat
Light the fire underneath me
Higher when I speak
Like I'm climbing up a steep tree
Oooh come and greet me
After the show, after the lights, after the shine
After the hoes, half of them yours, half of em mine
Happen to find they grill me but I'm the chef you want
Once you get a little taste I'ma buy the restaurant
Sittin' at the top, synonym: upper echelon
Busy watching my life, stop, I can get you one
Haters are always hanging round like a crucifix
But I been on the chase homie, I'm a fugitive

[Hook]
Nowadays got it all figured out
I dont really gotta' take so long (really gotta' take so long)
But I'm missing all the times in the past
When I couldn't see your face at all
That's why, the chase is on, the chase is on, the chase is on
That's why, the chase is on, the chase is on, the chase is on

[Verse 2]
Yeah, I said I could love a mystery
More than any misdemeanor
I ain't into wizardry
But all I see are these Sabrinas
Teenage witches with the Visas
Mastercards and Listerine
Got me so stressed
One day I will look like mr clean
Sheesh not a bald man
Who here needs a hall pass?
I would rather kick it and do nothin' like a mall rat
Never Kel Mitchell but baby I swear I'm all that
Cuz I leap years every time you fall back
To where you came from, now where the hate go?
Oh you from wu-tang? Then why's your face ghost?
Bottle up my confidence and sell it by the case load
Take a bunch of optimists, and drop'em in the same boat
Ask them if that shits half full, half empty
Too big for my own good, Dikembe
Mutombo you dumbos just envy
Name a bunch of rappers and pretend that you forget me
But..

[Hook]
Nowadays got it all figured out
I dont really gotta' take so long (really gotta' take so long)
But I'm missing all the times in the past
When I couldn't see your face at all
That's why, the chase is on, the chase is on, the chase is on
That's why, the chase is on, the chase is on, the chase is on

[Bridge]
So we stay chasin' on, getting paid
Break your heart every day
But if you want I'ma take it all back
If you want I'ma take it all back
So we stay chasin' on, getting paid
Break your heart every day
But if you want I'ma take it all back
If you want I'ma take it all back

[Hook]
Nowadays got it all figured out
I dont really gotta' take so long (really gotta' take so long)
But I'm missing all the times in the past
When I couldn't see your face at all
That's why, the chase is on, the chase is on, the chase is on
That's why, the chase is on, the chase is on, the chase is on
