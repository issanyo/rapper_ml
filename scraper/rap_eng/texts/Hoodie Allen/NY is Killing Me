[Hook: Hoodie Allen]
I said New York just killed me
How the fuck you feel now (get out(4x))
I said New York you kill me
How the fuck you feel now (get out(4x))
I said New York you kill me
How you feel now (get out)
How you feel now (get out)

[Verse 1: Hoodie Allen]
I said New York you kill me
Ok it's a love affair
I'm so rude, love to stare
What's that smell? Love in the air
Love so blind, can't see a thing
Oh I'm engaged? Can't see a ring
Oh you enslaved to everything that he say
Art galleries in the city with some DJs
Our Halloween in the city set on replay
Every single night you be wearing the disguise
What I am surprised to see you in this line?
Is this the night life? I can see you when I die
So I create, you criticize
I sleep late, you sleep with lies
So deep inside, it eats you alive
Like Coke, oh, no, why?

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Hoodie Allen]
Don't you? (3x)
See this side of the light, over the bridge
So far away, closing me in
Always begin at the minute I arrive
Like the city is asleep when I isn't on the side
But, I got a sweet tooth okay buttercup
Girls from bart okay shut it up
Girls at large oh they run amuck
Eating all the bacon so they take 'em to another lunch
In another month I'ma find em at a breakfast
Skin-tight leggings, real nice necklace
Where'd you get it?
That's a question that don't really need a response (why)
Because I'm leading you I-I-I'm leading you I-I-I'm leading you on
Oh they wanna kill me
Oh New York
You're killing me

[Hook 2: Hoodie Allen]
I said New York just killed me
How the fuck you feel now (It now(4x))
I said New York you kill me
How the fuck you feel now (It now(4x))
I said New York you kill me
How you feel now (get out)
