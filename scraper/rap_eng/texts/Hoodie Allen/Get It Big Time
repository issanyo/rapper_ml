[Verse 1]
We had alot of fun, we had are little dates
The kids that went from skateboarding into lower hate
So I be training at this music at growing rate
Alex P. Keaton I'am never seeing the growing pains
Because I'm so awake my eyelids are mad at me
I live for family that why I got this dame degree use to be up in the libary now I handle beats
So I can be a star up in New York like Anna Maria Style
Ooooh life outstanding and I got pow
East bound and down me
T'ill I brown out ooh robert downey
If women coming at me then I'm cleaning up like bounty so whatcha going to do but the best I know cuz I been hungry on this beat, ain't a  vegetable
And I can serve you up this heat
Got an extra four wall shit is extra cold
As long I stay up on this lane I'm the next to bowl

[Hook]
Get get get big time and I want to make everything mine
So I been working on it every night
Until you just can't get enough just can't get enough
Just can't get enough

[Verse 2]
They wanna call me up they wanna hear me speak
The kid that had to change he's phone like every week
So I be climbing up this charts till the very peak
A role model I just gotta get it Derek Lee
Kept pain plus a little champagne for my real friends
Toast until we old as Regis Philbin
Will keep celebrating if no ones in the buliding
Flip cam fetish girls someone better film them
Cuz this life amazing and I got buzz no need for shaving
If I gave up who I blame but the people in my life who would swear I would never make it
So I just eat it up french toast and bacon this is breakfast
I don't stick my nose, I just keep my head in
I can never sell out I could be Ephedrine
Bet a  motherfucker that I fit like tetris

[Hook 2x]

[Bridge]
Hail Mary, Tony Rome
I just go big, Let them suckers go home
I just go big, Let them suckers go home
I just go big, Let them suckers go home

[Hook]
