[UNRELEASED AS OF NOW]

A broke rapper from a gat bat
But now I'm Indie 500 and I'm livin' on the fast track
So watch me as I bounce back and jump up like Nasdaq
I know you couldn't imagine that
For the kid who's livin' in backpack
Well, I made a promise to my momma
I'mma be a better man
Took a couple months and now I got a couple grand to show for it
I take the subway, don't chauffeur it
I make 'em proud baby, go for it
Cause I be stayin' underground like I gofer-red it
If you afraid to be alone then get over it

I'm too young to die...
