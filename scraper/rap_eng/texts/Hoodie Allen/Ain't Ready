[Verse 1]
He told me love like this ain't supposed to last
The seasons changing, feelings go too fast
Remember when you said that I'm your better half
Sometimes I wish we could go back to that
And I was like woah
Not every story ends happily
But you know
You thought you knew what was best for me
But you don't
And gave it on, I was rest in peace
So let go
You got to let go

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause I'm a little bit drunk and a little bit high
But I meant what I said when I said goodbye

[Chorus]
Woah, I ain't ready for love
Woah, I ain't ready for love
Never did I think in a million years
That I'd get what I want and let it disappear
But say woah, I ain't ready for love

[Verse 2]
Check it, yo
I ain't ready for the love or the convo
When I'm chilling in the penthouse condo
Back on my bullshit like I'm Rondo
Six girls lined up that's Toronto
Everywhere we go it's like we're making a scene
People telling me that I'm the All-American dream
Rap Game, David Blaine, got some tricks in my sleeve
That gon' make it really hard for you to ever compete
Say, if you hated on me boy, you must be tripping, tripping
Got your girlfriend telling me I'm different, different
But I gotta pass on it like I'm Pippen, Pippen
Had a good night with you, now I'm dipping

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause I'm a little bit drunk and a little bit high
But I meant what I said when I said goodbye

[Chorus]
Woah, I ain't ready for love
Woah, I ain't ready for love
Never did I think in a million years
That I'd get what I want and let it disappear
But say woah, I ain't ready for love

[Bridge]
I ain't ready for your love
And baby, I need time
I ain't met no one like you before
Who made me change my mind, woah
I ain't ready for your love
And baby, keep it cool
I don't wanna be the one
To play the fool

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause I'm a little bit drunk, little bit high
But I meant what I said when I said goodbye

[Chorus]
Woah, I ain't ready for love
Woah, I ain't ready for love
Never did I think in a million years
That I'd get what I want and let it disappear
But say woah, I ain't ready for love
I ain't ready for love
Woah, I ain't ready for love
Woah, I ain't ready for love
Never did I think in a million years
That I'd get what I want and let it disappear
But say woah, I ain't ready for love
I ain't ready for love
