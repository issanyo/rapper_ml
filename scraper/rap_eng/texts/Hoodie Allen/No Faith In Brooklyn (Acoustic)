[Hook]
And we should take a walk someday, dream about what we could've been
But, I don't wanna leave this place, there's no faith in Brooklyn
But, if I move out one day, it will make me a better man
But, I don't wanna leave this place
There's no faith in Brooklyn

[Verse 1]
I said I'm so gone, oh my god, where the menu?
Order me all the sushi for them bitches at the venue
Stop, drop, roll, continue
Cause they just try to mingle, and I'm just trying to sing you a song
I tell ya that I'm leavin' but I won't be long
If it was up to me I would see ya tomorrow
But talk's cheap so I'm paying up
And new kicks be the only way I'm laying up
So maybe I won't make it as a athlete
But that don't mean I'll let the competition pass me
I money ball, Billy Beane and some skinny jeans
And the whole damn team just some mini me's
Cause they ain't seen another kid like this
It's on your mind baby you should probably write this
I told her I can dance good for a white kid
So turn around, show me everything I might miss

[Hook]
We should take a walk someday
Dream about what we could've been
But, I don't wanna leave this place
There's no faith in Brooklyn, no
If I move out one day
It will make me a better man
But, I don't wanna leave this place
No faith in Brooklyn

[Verse 2]
I said repetition-repe-repetition, like a muscle man
You just wanna tie me up and snap me like a rubber band
It's 2012 and now they wanna ask me what's the plan
I tell 'em never trust a man unless he Russell Brand
So pass me on that Absinthe now watch me change my accent
I got girls in the back on a mattress
You got girls on the map, like, that's it
They wanna know, am I Jay Sean or Raekwon?
Good Sean, or great Shawn?
Stay long, or Kreayshawn?
Now, either way, they try to stifle your dreams
I tell 'em keep your eyes open, you won't like what you see
And they be here for a minute, and now they gone in a week
You tryna Dante the peak, I'm tryna Andre the beat, Lord
And can you tell me where my faith is?
I graduated and I still ain't made the A-List
It ain't a problem if you tell me how you feel girl
I know the road rules, but you need the real world

[Hook]
And we should take a walk someday
Dream about what we could've been
But, I don't wanna leave this place
There's no faith in Brooklyn, no
So if I move out one day
It will make me a better man
But, I don't wanna leave this place
There's no faith in Brooklyn

[Outro]
I got no faith, no faith
No faith in Brooklyn
I got no faith, no faith
No faith in Brooklyn
I got no faith, no faith
No faith in Brooklyn
No faith in Brooklyn
No faith in Brooklyn, baby

[Hook]
We should take a walk someday
Dream about what we could've been
But, I don't wanna leave this place
There's no faith in Brooklyn, you know
If I move out one day
It will make me a better man
But, I don't wanna leave this place
There's no faith in Brooklyn

[Outro]
(No faith in Brooklyn)
