[Intro: Gunna]
Anything she want she can get, oh, give her (give her)
Anything she want she can get (she want, she can get)
Wheezy outta here

[Chorus: Young Thug]
She want Chanel, go get it, she want Chanel, go get it
She want this Fendi, go get it, she want a Birkin, go get it
She want this Gucci, she get it, she want this Louis, go get it
Loubs with the spikes, she get it, everything I got, she gettin' it, yeah
Bentley Sedan, she get it, hop out the Benz, she gettin' it
Hop out the Lamb, she gettin' it, the Porsche Cayenne, she gettin' it
Hop out the coupe, she get it, Asanti the shoes, she get it
I put my kids on her titty, anything she want she can get it

[Verse 1: Lil Uzi Vert]
Yeah! Woo! (pew, pew, pew, pew)
She want Chanel, let's get it (let's go!)
She want Chanel, let's get it (let's get it!)
She want Chanel, let's get it (let's get it, let's get it!)
Chanel cost more than a Honda Civic (huh?)
Baby tell me are you serious, yeah (what?)
These drugs got me so on delirious (yuh!)
Baby, you wet like Aquarius (yeah)
I'm a Leo baby you Aquarius
I took his bitch Iâ€™m not sharing
She fuck my side bitch she bi-curious
Not no iPhone, let you know that I'm serious
C-H to A-N to E-L
Off-White on me it combine with the Vuitton
She told that she want some Fendi
No we do not rock that got Gucci on three times (three times)
My Gucci shirt don't got no "i"
Just like the pussy we spread that shit real wide (gyah!)
Me and Thugger we get too fly
Hundred bands on me Jumpman with the squola
Silent ones hop by you two times
Taking this acid boy I done lost my mind
I'm a plant so this green is in my vines
Wouldn't tell you what I would do for my slimes

[Chorus: Young Thug & Lil Uzi Vert]
She want Chanel, go get it, she want Chanel, go get it (Yeah!)
She want this Fendi, go get it, she want a Birkin, go get it
She want this Gucci, she get it, she want this Louis, go get it
Loubs with the spikes, she get it, everything I got, she gettin' it, yeah
Bentley Sedan, she get it, hop out the Benz, she gettin' it
Hop out the Lamb, she gettin' it, the Porsche Cayenne, she gettin' it
Hop out the coupe, she get it, Asanti the shoes, she get it
I put my kids on her titty, anything she want she can get it

[Verse 2: Gunna]
Anything you see, you can get it
Here go the keys to the Bentley
When I fuck her, I got good intentions
I just can't get my palms to stop itchin'
Water on me like I live with the fishes
I done ordered every color in tennis
Got the diamonds put in by my dentist
I'ma shine when I'm skinnin' and grinnin'
Ice my watch, I'm not wastin' my time
Gunna dripping with Uzi and Slime
Connect with my bitch like WiFi
Slidin' in the DM like a Cha Cha
I got Ms, I can take care of the southside
I've been buildin' these billionaire ties
Got the Yves Saint Laurent heels in your size
Get the penthouse and fill it with vibes
Got Marc Jacobs, they cover my eyes
She need help, I'ma send her a dime
I can't pour nothing less than two lines
Luxury all the back seats recline
She want me to put that dick in her spine
Take her shoppin' to keep her from cryin'
Give you stones you one of a kind
Got Chanel with the C's on both sides

[Chorus: Young Thug]
She want Chanel, go get it, she want Chanel, go get it
She want this Fendi, go get it, she want a Birkin, go get it
She want this Gucci, she get it, she want this Louis, go get it
Loubs with the spikes, she get it, everything I got, she gettin' it, yeah
Bentley Sedan, she get it, hop out the Benz, she gettin' it
Hop out the Lamb, she gettin' it, the Porsche Cayenne, she gettin' it
Hop out the coupe, she get it, Asanti the shoes, she get it
I put my kids on her titty, anything she want she can get it
