[Verse 1]
'Member never trust these hoes
'Member never trust these hoes
'Member never trust these hoes, number one get you dough
Every day check my clothes, I've got all these different clothes
All the lean got me slow, yeah that lean got me slow
Yeah them xans got me slow, yeah them xans got me slow
Smokin' gas, can't see, Headband OG
Ten bandz on me, no friends 'round me
Only Family
All the style on me
Yeah my chopper from the store, in the range driving slow
Them niggas tried to kill my bro
Now for him, I'ma blow
Now it's just me and my bro, middle fingers to the foes
We're just focused on the dough, I've been gettin' all this dough

[Verse 2]
I've been stayin' up late, I've been tryin' to break the bank
I was tryna crack the safe, put the diamonds in the face
Put the diamonds in the face, put the diamonds in her face
Go 200 while I race, go 200 while I race
I'm a star, I'm a star, stars on top of my wrist
Get the fuck out my face, you can't talk about no cake
Cause I've been gettin' cake
Ballin' like I'm Dr. J, ballin' like I am MJ
If she don't give the face, cancel her, Ricki Lake
Eatin' shrimp with the steak, eatin' lobster with the steak
And that's on Versace plates
I'm still tryna fuck on Shay, I'm still tryna fuck on Shay
And do not talk to me, whether ain't about the cake

[Hook]
I've been countin' all this cake

I've been countin' all this cake

I've been countin' all this cake
Hundred thousand to my rolls
Hundred thousand to my rolls
Hundred thousand to my rolls
Hundred thousand to my rolls
Hundred thousand to my rolls
Hundred thousand to my rolls
Hundred thousand to my rolls
