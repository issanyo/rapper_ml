Bitch I'm leanin' I can barely stand up
I'm just faded I could barely answer
Bitch I'm leanin' I can barely stand up
Bitch I'm faded' I could barely answer
I drink lean til' my stomach cramp up
Jolly Rancher in the dirty Fanta (Fanta)
Bitch I'm leanin' I can barely stand up
Bitch I'm faded I could barely answer
Bitch I'm leanin' I can barely stand up
Bitch I'm faded' I could barely answer
I drink lean til' my stomach cramp up

[Verse 1: Reese LAFLARE]
Reese LAFLARE I'm back bitch
Bands in my pockets doin' backflips
I'm on deck,  better jump ship
Ride pass by I'm that quick
Middle fingers up, fuck what you thinkin'
Throwin' up dubs like WuTang
Young rich nigga got five in the tank
Jumpin' out the gym runnin' shit like Usain Bolt
They fuck with me the longway
All the way from Gresham road to parkway
Where they double park a motherfuckin' school hall way
I done killed this bitch done think I'm OJ
Geekin' off the dope need some more Js
Four girls plus one nigga thats a four way
Dope man Nikes on when I'm in the hallway
Bitch I'm faded
Saint Laurents got me faded
Pull up on your shoulder I'mma shock ya like Raiden
Lightskin rollin' it up nigga face it (yup)
Who the fuck told you I don't do this
Lean off the act then I eat up your chick
Bossed up nigga we lost to you shrimps
Designer on everything thats how we live
Thats on my word, thats on my kids
I fathered my minions
I worked
I might be I might be my nigga I'm feelin' maxed out
With the shits
I roll up with money you hangout with 12
Buster punks that came to raise hell
Rich as fuck so I can make bail
Rich as fuck so I can make bail

Double cup that be drippin', It's Actavis what I'm sippin'
I'm juggin' and juggin' and brickin'
And I'm bout to cop Audi

Shoutout to my woadie, extra shoutout to my woadie
And that just be his bitch, I swear that be my hoe (thats true)
Lean it got my eyes low
Versace shades they cost 40 (forty)
I just wanna fuck over money, and I'mma fuck over your hoe
Nigga you smokin' on dope
Well nigga I'm sippin on dope (that act)
White bitch she sniffin' on coke

Shit, I might as well sniff me some coke
