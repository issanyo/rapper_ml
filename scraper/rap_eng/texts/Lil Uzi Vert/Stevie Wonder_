[Lyrics from snippet]

[Verse]
Stevie Wonder with the bitch, yeah
Cause you know I cannot see her
Only money in my readers
All of my girls just be eaters
All of my whips, they two seaters
But if she got friends I can't leave her
New Citizens my pockets seniors
My bands, they old just like Jeter
Put my side bitch in a Beamer
Don't give a damn like a beaver
Back in my phone when I reach her
No I can't talk 'bout no features
It's not nothing that you could teach us
Don't hit her up, I like to tease her
You know that my swag off the meter
Get the guap, fuck is a visa
Bake the work like it's a [?]
I'll be cappin if I need her
Diamonds they blue like I'm meeting them
Diamonds all over my fingers
Bankroll on me I'm a beaner
I 'member I was a leaner
Hit from the back she a screamer
Kick her right out like she best friends with Gina

Aye I am from Mars
I had to

Get it up
I had to turn my city up
She was skinny, blew her titties up
Blue hundreds, with them fifties up
Bought my bitch a [?]
Fuck nigga not with funny stuff
Did I tell you that my pockets stuffed?
They stuffed like a encyclopedia

Young nigga flex, ooh
Watch how a young nigga flex, aye
That little bitch gave me neck
Do anything for a check
'Member my life was a mess, aye
