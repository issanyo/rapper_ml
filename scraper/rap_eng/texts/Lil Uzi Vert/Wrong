[Intro: Max]
You are a lonely
You are a lo.. go

[Verse 1: Max]
Wanted to take her back to my place
Driving 90, let the cops chase
Making that "Damn it feels so good" face
Cause she don't wanna wait, no, wait 'til we get home

[Pre-Chorus: Max]
Oh that girl, she want it, yeah she need it
She a bad mother, and I believe it

[Chorus: Max]
She says "Pull over and don't lock the doors"
She doesn't care who sees anymore
It's better when it feels wrong
(Ooh-oh, ooh-oh-oh, oh yeah, ooh-oh)
It's better when it feels wrong
(Ooh-oh, ooh-oh-oh, oh yeah, ooh-oh)

[Verse 2: Max]
Six miles high up in the airspace
She says, "Come on to the back, baby"
Everybody knows just what's happening
But she don't give a shit, nah, she just want this OOH!!

[Pre-Chorus: Max]
Oh that girl, she want it, yeah she need it
She a bad mother, and I believe it

[Chorus: Max]
She says "Come closer and don't lock the door"
She doesn't care who sees anymore
It's better when it feels wrong
(Ooh-oh, ooh-oh-oh, oh yeah, ooh-oh)
It's better when it feels wrong
(Ooh-oh, ooh-oh-oh, oh yeah, ooh-oh)
It's better when it feels wrong
(Ooh-oh, ooh-oh-oh, oh it's better, ooh-oh)
It's better when it feels wrong
(Ooh-oh, ooh-oh-oh, oh yeah, ooh-oh)
It's better when it feels wrong

[Verse 3: Lil Uzi Vert]
Pull up, skrrt, in that, drop, top, for me, yah
I ain't, seen, max, since, like, the, summer, yah
Count all hunnids, I stay from ya
Count all hunnids, I stay from ya
Now baby are you really feelin me or its because what I was just talkin about
After I'm done you tell me you love me I look at you now I be kickin you out
Yahh
Baby tell me is you real
Baby tell me is you real
Baby tell me is you real

[Chorus: Max]
It's better when it feels wrong
(Ooh-oh, ooh-oh-oh, ooh-oh)
It's better when it feels wrong
(Ooh-oh, ooh-oh-oh, oh it's better, ooh-oh)
It's better when it feels wrong
(Ooh-oh, ooh-oh-oh, ooh-oh)
It's better when it feels wrong
(Ooh-oh, ooh-oh-oh, ooh-oh)
It's better when it feels wrong
