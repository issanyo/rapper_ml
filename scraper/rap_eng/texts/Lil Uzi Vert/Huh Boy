Make it shake like a motor
Say she in love with a nigga
Say she in love with the life
I ain't been home in a minute
And yes, she be getting me right
Say she really want a sentence
My young niggas got plenty
Hundred thousand in the skinnies
Fishtailing out of Denny's
We gonna book you a day

You know the windbreaker is Bape
You know I Louie the drapes
Hustle brand new, ain't got plates
Call up Michelle for a plate
Make me the strip, wanna stay
You know that I got the cake
