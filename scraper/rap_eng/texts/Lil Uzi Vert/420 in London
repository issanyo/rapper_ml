[Intro: Pressa]
Murda, Murda, Murda shit
Ayy

[Chorus: Pressa]
420 up in London
I'm a problem, call the ombudsman (hello?)
Me and Murda, we up to somethin'
I was on the hound and almost caught me in Fort Nelson
Mr. Hustle hard, now they claimin' they my cousin
I fuck your bitch, now she thinkin' I'm her husband
I'm in some Balmains, these jeans cost a dozen
I'm iced out, this Rollie cost me nothin'(ice)

[Verse 1: Pressa]
Remember days when I was on the run
Couldn't leave my house without a gun
Told Mama wouldn't make them take your son
I moved her out the hood now a nigga shoot for fun(let's get it)
Fuck a friend I just do this for my loved ones
We came far from sleeping in the dungeon
Air contamination I ain't breath right since hustlin'
Started off with coins now I'm run-in' up the hundreds
Mama found my strap in my room while she cussin'
Neighbor was a traphouse cuz' I had it pumpin'
Plottin' on the mansion
Views by the sunset
Cookin' up my dinner
Never ate my lunch yet
Pressa got you mad, huh?
30 clip mad long
Trip it till' the pack gone
Business was my thing
Gotta keep a structure
Shots up to Taurus
His lungs were punctured
Diamonds were my first name
Coolin' for the culture
Ran out of minutes
Think I need a voucher

[Verse 2: Lil Uzi Vert]
I was on the molly, bitches out in Boston
Fucked the bitch in Follies, her pussy was awesome
Wrestle like Jeff Hardy, do tricks like Mat Hoffman
She just wanna party, she do that shit often
She gon' suck my dick until she start gaggin' and coughin'
Am I scared? No, hardly, I deserve a heart lift
My new crib, it's so big, this shit got a office
I was off a thirty, this shit made me nauseous
My new car on derbies, automatic park it
Ballin' in my jersey, in the streets I'm Jordan
12 checked me, then they took my gun
Me, no trippin' 'cause I got a whole 'nother gun
If she leave me, yeah I've got a whole 'nother one
I put that on my son and I ain't even got a son
Red green, beam green, bitch I never miss
She sucked the lines up out my dick like it's a peppermint
I get the cheese, like I work for the government
I'm an alien lookin' for your mother ship

[Chorus: Lil Uzi Vert]
420 up in London
I'm a problem, God, yeah, I'll bust 'em (on god)
Me and Murda, we up to somethin'
I was on the the hound they almost caught me at Fort Nelson
Mr. Hustle hard, now they claimin' they're my cousin (my cousin)
I fuck your bitch, now she thinkin' I'm her husband
I'm in some Balmains, these jeans they cost a dozen (12)
I'm iced out, this Rollie cost me nothin' (uh)

[Outro: Lil Uzi Vert]
I'm iced out, this Rollie cost me nothin'
I'm iced out, this Rollie cost me nothin'
I'm iced out, this Rollie cost me nothin'
I'm iced out, this Rollie cost me nothin'
Yeah!
