All I ever wanted was the bitches and the fame (nat nats)
But instead I got a hundred thousand and a range
Bitch ass nigga talking

All I ever wanted was a mil' (mil')
Steak and lobster meals (meal)
Counting out a mil' (mil')
Actavis, crack the seal (yeah, yeah, yeah, wooh)
All my diamonds teal (yeah, yeah, yeah, wooh)
All my diamonds real (yeah, yeah, yeah, wooh)
My bitch eyes they be teal, white bitch, white bitch white bitch
Two choppas feeling little (twin on twin on choppas)
Told that hoe my name was David (why you do that)

None of my choppas is regular
All of your choppas is regular
None of my choppas is registered

You is a snitch

[Verse 2]
Som' wrong with 'dis rari
It's too fast, I'm sorry
Sellin' them drugs, no bargain
Think they tap my phone, don't call me
Twelve gon' pull me over
Sandwich bags in the glove compartment
They say why you got all this
I said I'm 'bout to have a party
They found thirty thousand
I said bitch I'm an artist
Soon as he went to give me a ticket
Boom, pulled out the forty
Bitch we shooting at twelve
Bitch we shooting at twelve
Bitch we shooting at twelve
Bitch we shooting at twelve
Choppa a give you hell
Its big as Nerlens Noel
I 'member when I was eleven
My bro was trapping at twelve
That's back when we had a curfew
Had to come in the house at twelve
Get them drugs through FedEx
No send back address on the mail
