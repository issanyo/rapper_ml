[Intro]
Thank you, Fizzle

[Chorus: 03 Greedo]
Tell the bank teller to relax (I had to tell that bitch, "Relax")
I got all these blue hundreds in the Glad bag (I got this money in the bag)
Tell a bank teller to relax (I had to tell that bitch, "Relax")
I got all these blue hundreds in the Glad bag (I got this, hey)
Tell a bank teller, tell a bank teller (ayy), bank teller
Tell a bank teller (woo), tell a bank (ayy), tell a bank teller (ayy)
Tell a bank teller , tell a bank teller (ayy), bank teller (ayy)
What I can't tell her, what I can’t (ayy), what I can't tell her? (ayy)

[Verse 1: Lil Pump]
What I can't tell her (huh), is that I just fucked her daughter (your daughter)
Jerry Springer just told me that Lil Pump is not the father (uh-uh)
I got two trap houses (trap) and they all modern (brrt)
I just had a threesome in my PE locker, ooh (PE)
I don’t want your bitch no more (no more), ooh
Pouring up eighths, not fours, ooh (yeah)
I just fucked a bitch, said she 35, oh (brrt)
Told her "suck my dick", I'ma put your ass on (goddamn)
Got three mansions and three phones (phones)
I forgot that I had a stripper at home (yeah)
I got molly, I got beans (woah)
I got percs and lot of cups

[Chorus: 03 Greedo]
Tell a bank teller, tell a bank teller (ayy), bank teller
Tell a bank teller (woo), tell a bank (ayy), tell a bank teller (ayy, ayy)
Tell a bank teller, tell a bank teller (ayy), bank teller
What I can't tell her, what I can't (woo), what I can't tell her? (ayy)

[Verse 2: 03 Greedo]
I'm in the foreign doin' 40 in the FasTrak
Drivin' slowly ’cause I can’t see past this trash bag
I got big bank, Gucci on the dash-dash (free Drakeo)
I got money, give a fuck about a dashcam (skrrt, yeah)
Transform a new McLaren to a Trans Am
She just shit just like a birdie 'cause I’m cashed in (I'm too fuckin' cashed)
I just bought a brick, that's 36 O’s
Studio in it, with like 36 hoes
Niggas on the block, ask the bitch to move over
Take that trip, don't lose that loaf

[Chorus: 03 Greedo & Lil Uzi Vert]
Tell a bank teller, tell a bank teller (ayy), bank teller
Tell a bank teller (woo), tell a bank (ayy), tell a bank teller (ayy, ayy)
Tell a bank teller, tell a bank teller (ayy), bank teller
What I can't tell her (Lil Uzi), what I can't, what I can't tell her? (ayy, let's go)

[Verse 3: Lil Uzi Vert]
Rockstar, like I'm Paul McCartney (yeah)
Ooh, Stella, Stella (ayy)
I can't hear nothin', Helen Keller
You get punched and then some
Me no rat, I get hella cheddar, I get mozzarella
Take two-hunnid thousand out the bank, 'cause I fucked the teller
My dough nuts, yeah my Kreme too Krispy, you can't kiss me, lick me
Asian bitch playin' with my balls, so I call her Misty
I fucked Trixie, then I made a wish, then saw Icky Vicky
I'm not Mixy, you niggas too iffy, my Glock got a stiffy

[Chorus: 03 Greedo]
Tell a bank teller to relax (I had to tell that bitch, "Relax")

What I can't tell her, what I can't, what I can't tell her? (ayy, ayy)

[Verse 4: DestoDubb & Lil Uzi Vert]
Maison Margielas cost seven or better
I'm a bank teller, no I'm a drank seller (ayy)
I'm a fat nigga in a Gucci sweater
I'm a rich nigga and she a gold digger
He a great nigga, no, he a great nigga
He rockin' Bape, but it's all fake nigga
They calling me racist 'cause I hate niggas
Grinding so hard that my portions got bigger
You is a better and I am a bidder
She gave me top, so I had to send dinner
Only sip Wock, I do not do no liquor
I am a winner and you is a quitter
Suckin' my dick, now I know she a spitter
Kickin' these pints, you gon' think I'm a kicker
A pint before breakfast, a pint before dinner
0-03 Pump, Greedo my nigga

[Verse 5: Smokepurpp]
Tell a bank teller, this Louis my sweater
Came through with a Baretta, stack my cheese, that mozzarella
Look at my teeth, uh (yeah), diamonds all on my teeth (ayy), ooh
I'm gon' eat, uh (huh), ooh, bon appétit (Lil Purpp), ooh
She want come inside, but I'm gon' fuck her in the car (get some), ooh (huh)
He gon' try to run, but I'm gon' put him on that dart
Smoking weed and sippin' lean, diamonds dance in the dark (yeah)
See the drip and see these diamonds, she know we all stars

[Chorus: 03 Greedo]
Tell a bank teller to relax (I had to tell that bitch, "Relax")
