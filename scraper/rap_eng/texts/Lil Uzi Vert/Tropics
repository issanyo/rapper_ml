Yea yea yea

[Hook]
I met a bitch in the tropics
And she be gone off the molly
She suck my dick super sloppy
I had to tell me somebody

[Verse 1]
I met a bitch in the tropics
She super thick in the body
I had to call up my hombre
I had to tell me somebody
I swear that bitch must be crazy
If she might think she my lady
I swear that bitch ate my baby
I will not buy her Mercades
They see Uzi got the money
The bitches scream come save me

[Hook x2]
I met a bitch in the tropics
And she be gone off the molly
She suck my dick super sloppy
I had to tell me somebody

[Verse 2]
Boy my pockets hella swole
Cause I got the bankroll
Balmain pockets hella swole
Cause I got the bankroll
Your bank account on zero
Your bitch look at me like a hero
Tropic foreign bitches
Tropic foreign bitches
And I'm getting money
Tropic foreign digits
I tell the truth
I tell the truth
All I got is tropics

[Hook]
I met a bitch in the tropics
And she be gone off the molly
She suck my dick super sloppy
I had to tell me somebody
