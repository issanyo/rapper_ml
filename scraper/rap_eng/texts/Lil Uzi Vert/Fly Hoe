[Verse 1]
In a coupe with a fuckin' 10
Chopper with a motherfuckin' grent
All my young niggas, they hittin' licks
All our handguns come me with them sticks
Diamond Rollie, diamond fist
Don't try boy or you a die boy
Chopper with the clip
I just fucked Keyana told her do not give me lip (no)
Keyana she a bomb bitch, suck my dick and use her lips
I got some fuckin' riders that'll get you fuckin' chipped
Tatted like my idol, livin' by my title
I dress like a punk rock
But tattoos come from the bible (yea)
Cars on suicidal
My bitch tall like a vinyvl, woo
What you sayin' bro, lets fight hoe
In Mexico with the plug eatin' pico de gallo
I got all this money, you ain't fly hoe (no no)
I say I'm so I'm fly hoe
This dick you buy hoe, she pay 500
Ride that dick like bike hoe (yeah)
She say if I pay my money ride like motorcycles
I just pulled up in my Wraith, stuntin' by mistake
Had to go and get that money no I couldn't wait

[Outro]
What you sayin' bro, lets fight hoe
In Mexico with the plug eatin' pico de gallo
I got all this money, you ain't fly hoe (no no)
I say I'm so I'm fly hoe
This dick you buy hoe, she pay 500
Ride that dick like bike hoe (yeah)
Ever since I got my money ride like motorcycles
I just pulled up in my rari stuntin' by mistake
Had to go and get the money no I couldn't wait
