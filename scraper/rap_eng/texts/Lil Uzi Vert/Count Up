[Verse 1: Lil Uzi Vert]
Woo!
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, nigga (count up)
Woo! Count up
My lil nigga gon' count up
Yeah, I be flexin' on camera
Pour up the dirty, it's Fanta
Got the ammo on the counter
Jump out the war, look like Rambo
I jump out the war, look like Rambo
Aw, nowadays, I really aim for nothin'
Everything I do about the money
That why Lil Uzi be gettin' money
These niggas talkin', they ain't 'bout nothin'
These niggas singin' like David Ruffin
My gun, I'll spray it, it get to blushin'
Hunnids and fifties my pockets stuffed with

[Verse 2: Kyyngg]
A, B, C, D, I'm a G
Givenchy cover my feet
I killed that pussy so bad
She tried to call the police
Lil bitch, you ain't cuffin' me
You can't fall in love with a G
I'm tryna get all these bands
I fell in love with the streets
I'm runnin' it up
Niggas be quick to shit on what you doin'
I'm from New Orleans, I am the influence
Ain't tryna be rude, disrespect get you ruined
I'm a young killer, nigga, really, nigga
I'ma take your bitch and have fun with her
[?] now I'm done with her
You know I gave her right back
Lil bitch, we back to the racks
