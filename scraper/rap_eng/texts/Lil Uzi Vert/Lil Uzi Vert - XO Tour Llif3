[Intro - Lil Uzi Vert]
Are you alright?
I'm alright, I'm quite alright
And my money's right
8â€¦ (yeah)
Countin' them bands all way to the top, 'til they be fallin' over
Countin' them bands, on my way to the top, 'til we fallin' over

[Chorus - Lil Uzi Vert]
I don't really care if you cry
On the real, you shoulda never lied
Shoulda saw the way she looked me in my eyes
She said: "Baby, I am not afraid to die."
Push me to the edge
All my friends are dead
Push me to the edge
All my friends are dead
Push me to the edge
All my friends are dead
Push me to the edge

[Verse 1 - Lil Uzi Vert]
Phantom that's all red, inside all white
Like somethin' you ride a sled down, I just want that head
My Brittany got mad, I'm barely her man now
Everybody got the same swag now
Watch the way that I tear it down
Stackin' my bands all the way to the top
All the way 'til my bands fallin' over
Every time that you leave your spot
Your girlfriend call me like, "Come on over!"
I like the way that she treat me
Gon' leave you, won't leave me, I call it that Casanova
She say I'm insane, yeah
I might blow my brain out
Xanny, help the pain, yeah
Please, Xanny, make it go away
I'm committed, not addicted, but it keep control of me
All the pain, now I can't feel it
I swear that it's slowin' me, yeah

[Chorus - Lil Uzi Vert]
I don't really care if you cry
On the real, you shoulda never lied
Saw the way she looked me in my eyes
She said: "I am not afraid to die."
All my friends are dead
Push me to the edge
All my friends are dead, yeah
Push me to the edge
All my friends are dead, yeah
All my friends are dead, yeah

[Verse 2 - Lil Uzi Vert]
That is not your swag, I swear you fake hard
Now these niggas wanna take my cadence
Rain on 'em, thunderstorm, rain on 'em (ooh, yeah)
Medicine, lil' nigga, take some (yeh, yeh)
Fast car, NASCAR, race on 'em
In the club, ain't got no ones, then we would beg them
Clothes from overseas, got the racks and they all C-Notes
You is not a G though
Lookin' at you stackin' all your money, it all green though
I was countin' that and these all twenties, that's a G-roll

[Bridge - Lil Uzi Vert]
She say: "You're the worst, you're the worst."
I cannot die because this my universe

[Verse 3 - Fetty Wap]
Shorty said she miss me, but she lie (but she lie)
Something 'bout me leaving made her cry (made her cry)
She don't want another nigga in her life (in her life, yeah)
I can't believe it yeah, I can't believe it no
Baby imma tell you what went wrong (what went wrong)
When I was sleeping, you was going through my phone (through my phone)
I was creeping yeah I couldn't leave her alone (leave her alone, yeah)
Even moved little shorty in my home (in my home, yeah)
And she played it cool and kept it smooth (kept it smooth, yeah)
Instagram the only way you knew (way you knew)
I ain't playing with you, I'm just being true, yeah
There's a million niggas doing what I do (what I do)
But a million niggas wouldn't tell the truth (tell the truth)
Kept it g but I guess it didn't work (didn't work, yeah)
Loyalty the only thing that hurt (thing that hurt, yeah)
I can't believe it yeah, I can't believe it no

[Chorus - Lil Uzi Vert]
I don't really care if you cry
On the real, you shoulda never lied
Shoulda saw the way she looked me in my eyes
She said: "Baby, I am not afraid to die."
Push me to the edge
All my friends are dead
Push me to the edge
All my friends are dead
Push me to the edge
All my friends are dead
Push me to the edge
