[Hook]
Pull up hundred miles an hour had to pump my brake
Stackin' all my guala have to count my cake
Watch these hundreds pile up put that on my bank
You can trust nobody cause they all be fake
Watch these hundreds pile up put that on my bank
Watch these hundreds pile up put that on my bank
Watch these hundreds pile up put that on my bank

[Verse 1]
Knockin' on her door...
All these haters watchin' [?] haters with me
Heard you crack them cards that be that tricky business
Put my dick in that broad that be that sticky businesss
When you look at my ice it just be drippin' drippin'
When you look at my ring it just be bling blow
Took a hipster bitch to shop at V Files
I got bread on bread I'm the cash cow
Bitch give me some head while I'm layin' down
I'm in Chinatown whippin...
