[Verse: Lil Uzi Vert]
Bitches all up on my dick
And I bought some of these lips
And I be getting the money, got fifties and hundreds like I just hit me a lick
Choppin' a brick, my bitch just be choppin' and choppin' a brick
Winter time fox on the list
Summer time's here so it's droppin' the top on the whip
Extended clip right on the Uzi
My bitch got extended clip right on the fifth
Rollie matching on the wrist
And She love sucking my dick, and you love taking her out

[Verse: Phat Geez]
You like taking her out
And I'm dickin' her down, get the fuck out my house
We got limited work
(what the fuck is a drought?) what the fuck is a drought?
We moving it in and pitching it out
Might give her the dick, don't be running your mouth
Don't be running your mouth, we snatching em all don't ask for the price
Won't make it upstairs, you get fucked on the couch
Fucked on the couch let me slow it down
When I'm in the building smelling like a pound
Your bitch on my dick tell her wipe it down (wipe it down)
Yeah Uzi tell her wipe it down

[Hook: Lil Uzi Vert ]
She only want a lil niggah cause I'm eatin'
Man I swear, it looks deceiving
And your bitch all on my dick just for no reason
Man I swear, it looks deceiving

[Hook Phat Geez]
She only want a lil niggah cuz I'm eatin'
Oh, I looks deceiving
If she ain't tryna fuck me bitch you leaving
Oh, bitch you leaving

[Verse: Lil Uzi Vert]
She said Lil Uzi, can't keep my name out her mouth
Yeah I was all in your bed, nigga I fuck with your house
Nobody don't know who you is, where the fuck is your clout
I open the trunk, nigga what you want
This .50 Cal have you running a route
Nigga I am on the rise, in the kitchen with my guys
Mixing the pot this shit is a bakery, just the way Uzi be flipping them pies (whip)
If I ain't gripping the tec, then I be grippin' the nine
If I ain't grippin her hips, then I be grippin' her thighs
