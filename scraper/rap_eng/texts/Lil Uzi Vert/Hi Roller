Wake up every day, know that I am blessed
Counting up my cake, getting all them checks

Keep her around I swear that girl she a gem
Before I was on, fucked on the twins

Raf Simons, Rick Owens, little Phillip Lim
She said she ain't want me so I fucked her friend
Open up my mouth white diamonds when I grin
Goyard bags cost more than your rent
Goyard wallet cost more than your Gucci
Put my baby girl in Ferrari Moncler she bougie

Mood swing, mood swing girl you gon' lose me
Mood swing, mood swing girl you gon' lose me
Same thing over and over girl you can't fool me
Same thing over and over girl you can't fool me

[Chorus]
Wake up every day, know that I am blessed
Counting up my cake, getting all them checks
Pull up in a Wraith, I'm just trying to flex
Why you want to hate, you do it the best
I'm a high roller
You know I'm a high roller
You know I'm a high roller
You know I'm a high roller
