[Verse 1: NAV]
Double G buckle tucked under my shirt
I taste codeine when I burp
I bought a Bentley forgot it insured
You just a broke boy, you get on my nerves
What would I do if the music ain't work?
If I turn my trap phone off will it still chirp?
I couldn't tell nouns from a verb
But I could sell wings to a bird
I could sell tags to a shirt
Askin' me if you got tickets for sure
I don't know, I'm not sure
You just got hit with the curve
I didn't know that girl was yours
Said that she don't got no boyfriend, but sure
I grabbed her ass, and she call me a perv
Open the legs, so I had to insert
Make my own beats, and I write my own words
Cash found a diamond, tucked under the dirt
I blew my third cheque and second and first
Now I stack up, pay my bills on the first
Me and Body goin' half on the chicken
First we sell it, then we splittin' the difference
I don't got no time to waste on no bitches
Cause I know that the sea got lots of fishes

[Chorus: NAV]
Smokin' and stackin' and countin' up green
I think I need me a money machine
I heard some fuckboys are plottin' on me
Waist 32, .40 tucked in my jeans
Won't forget when no one cared about me
Talkin' but they don't know shit about me
Mad I'm the person they wanted to be
This ain't the shit that they wanted to see, yeah
Now they lookin' at me
Now everybody they lookin' at me, now they lookin' at me
Now everybody they lookin' at me, now they lookin' at me
Now everybody they lookin' at me, now they lookin' at me

[Verse 2: Lil Uzi Vert]
Come in the spot and I'm lookin' so clean (clean)
Balmain, that's all on my jeans (what)
These niggas mad 'cause I'm gettin' that cream (cream)
Steady be makin' them memes
No, no, no, I don't mean to intervene
I'm a outcast, I'm so fresh and so clean (woo)
I fuck your bitch to blow off some steam
Semi-colon; I got low self-esteem (yeah)
Shenaynay, that's what we call the pussy
Oh my goodness, that boy speak to police
When I see 12, I can't talk, I can't see (I can't see)
Shh, shh, shh, fuck niggas, do not bark up the wrong tree
Her bedroom look like a coffin to me
On the real, her pussy awesome to me (yeah)
Gag all these niggas that coughin' at me
Turn to Stephen Hawking when the burner asleep
AKA badder than your whole damn team (yeah)
You couldn't even get close to me in your dreams

[Chorus: NAV & Lil Uzi Vert]
Smokin' and stackin' and countin' up green
I think I need me a money machine (yeah)
I heard some fuckboys are plottin' on me
Waist 32, .40 tucked in my jeans (yeah)
Won't forget when no one cared about me
Talkin' but they don't know shit about me
Mad I'm the person they wanted to be
This ain't the shit that they wanted to see, yeah (brown boy)
Now they lookin' at me
Now everybody they lookin' at me, now they lookin' at me
Now everybody they lookin' at me, now they lookin' at me
Now everybody they lookin' at me, now they lookin' at me
