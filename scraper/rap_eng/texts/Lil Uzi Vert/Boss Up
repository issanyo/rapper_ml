Wave

[Hook: Wave Chapelle]
Okay, I just wanna see the millions (I do)
Yeah, get that money how you living
Okay, real niggas in the building
I call my own shots, I make my own decisions
Young nigga boss up
Counting all my guap and I call my own shots

[Verse 1: Wave Chapelle]
I swear I got no time to kick it, I'm too busy punching the clock
I'm riding around and I'm gettin' it, crushing the block
She see me stunting, she ask if I'm hustling or not
I'm like 'you fucking or not'
You know I ain't cuffing no thots
Nigga, thats rule number one, nigga, thats rule number one
Now I get paid for this raps, I used to do this for fun
They say I'm feeling myself but I just know that I'm the one
And I still rep the Northside, nigga you know where I'm from
Nigga ain't nothing new, them boys don't know what to do
If you on your grind then I fuck with you
I'm grinding until I'm uncomfortable
I'm balling I don't need a substitute
I'm feeling like Pac, man I got the juice
Young niggas winning, I keep this shit wavey
I'm stacking the veggies like my nigga Casey

[Hook: Wave Chapelle]
Okay, I just wanna see the millions (I do)
Yeah, get that money how you living
Okay, real niggas in the building
I call my own shots, I make my own decisions
Young nigga boss up
Counting all my guap and I call my own shots

[Verse 2: Lil Uzi Vert]
Go to the kitchen and open the cabinet
And get the chicken with the soup
Now, I ride around [?]
In my side of the city with chickens in my coupe
And I used to be scared of the block
Taking shells off the pot, make it do what it do
No lackin', we clappin'
Your captain is here to turn back on clip full 32
Young ratchets in Texas, it's sliders and actors
Lil Uzi, that nigga be mackin'
Philly down [?] 1600
Take a xanny pill, nigga what's hatnin'?
On top of my city
The bitches they be showin' me titties, never thought this could happen
Man went down to Atlanta, and eversince then nigga family fuck with him get damage
And we makin' millions, yeah we makin' millions
I swear it's still the way that we plan it
Bein' your own boss come with a cost
Try to kill me, I'm takin' you off
This earth, I put you right in the dirt
Take this pain away, takin' [?] and percs
I call my own shots, [?] bitch dead to alive
Lil Uzi, that nigga on top

[Hook: Wave Chapelle]
Okay, I just wanna see the millions (I do)
Yeah, get that money how you living
Okay, real niggas in the building
I call my own shots, I make my own decisions
Young nigga boss up
Counting all my guap and I call my own shots
