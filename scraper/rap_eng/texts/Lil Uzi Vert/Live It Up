FKI
Skirr!

[Hook]
Gettin' money, countin' mad dough, Young nigga gonna live it up
Audi R8, hella ice, you just got none, spit it up
Imma bring my team with me, made sure that I split it up
Japanese mixed with Brazilian, all my hoes be mixed up
Countin' money, I'm countin' money, Countin' money, I don't get enough
Countin' money all day and night, Countin' money, I don't get enough
Twenty, fifty, and a hunded, hunded, hunded, hundeds swear I don't get enough
Countin' money, countin' money, Lil Uzi don't get enough

[Verse 1]
I ain't really interested in her, if she ain't tryna let me fuck
Swerving in a new Bentley, ridin' 'round with a million bucks
I know haters I got plenty, but I don't give a million fucks
Walk around I could see, dozing off of a million drugs
Hit, your ass just with the snow
Hang with the drug dealers and the thugs
Okay I swear that I'm in the mud
Okay I swear that I'm sipping mud
My bitch so dirty I need a bag
My bitch so spoiled, she need a bag
Celine, the Hermes, the Birkin bag
Spent ten thousand for my bitch, yeah

Countin' money, I'm countin' money, Countin' money, I don't get enough
Countin' money all day and night, Countin' money, I don't get enough
Twenty, fifty, and a hunded, hunded, hunded, hundeds swear I don't get enough
Countin' money, countin' money, Lil Uzi don't get enough
