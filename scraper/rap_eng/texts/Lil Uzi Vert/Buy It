[Verse 1]
Why that boy just wanna play with me?
Like I don't um keep that K on me
You was a worm, keep that bait on me
Killin' my compo' so fatally
Yeah, woohoo, ballin' like I'm Bo Jack
Sometimes I think too much, wish that I'd think less
When you lie to me that is not English (I don't understand)
I must admit that you was the best
Fuck the rest
I don't see nobody, yeah, fuck the rest
I can't stop no, no, I don't fuck with rest
On the real, wish I thought of you less
On the real, wish I fucked you less
Thought you was real cause the things you said
Thought you was real cause you ain't invade my checks
Thought you was my future, but you're my ex

[Hook]
Nowadays got a side chick on side chick
They keep hackin' my iPhone, 'bout to get a Sidekick
I don't like to stand up, told that girl to ride it
Murakami, buy it, Goyard, buy it
Phillip Lim, buy it, Rick Owens, buy it
Off-White, buy it, even though I don't got to buy it
VLONE tatted on me, if you thought I was lyin' (VLONE thug)
Girl you need a back, back, ooh, you need some Trident
Nowadays got a side chick on side chick
They keep hackin' my iPhone, 'bout to get a Sidekick
I don't like to stand up, told that girl to ride it
Murakami, buy it, Goyard, buy it
Phillip Lim, buy it, Rick Owens, buy it
Off-White, buy it, even though I don't got to buy it
VLONE tatted on me, if you thought I was lyin'
Girl you need a back, back, ooh, you need some Trident

[Verse 2]
And if it is a problem, my niggas ridin'
Know my niggas slidin', turn it to a riot
I fucked her in a SLS, you fucked her in a Hyatt
Ain't nothin' wrong with that, I'm just a little more high-end
