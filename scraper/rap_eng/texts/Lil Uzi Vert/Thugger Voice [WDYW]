[Chorus]
I turn five to a ten

Forty-forty hit your woodie shorty
Balmain, Saint Laurent with the Fendi
I turn five to a ten
I turn twenty to a fifty
Forty-forty hit your woodie shorty
Balmain, Saint Laurent with the Fendi
Whatchu want, tell me whatchu want
(What do you want?)
Like whatchu want, like what do you want?
(What do you want?)
Whatchu want? Let a nigga know
Let a nigga know, yeah

[Verse 1]
You get hit, 40'll hurt you
I got your bitch on me and your mama on me and she birth you
Lil Uzi, and he's off the shits
Got your bitch on me, she all-all on the dick
I get so turnt up, countin' these bands these bands
I don't give a motherfuck, I am the man
Stay down with me bae, your girl my baby
I'm fuckin' on, I'm too lazy
Uzi might hit now, said Uzi might hit
I got your girl now, and she be all on my dick
Hotel room, in a hotel
It don't matter, I do whatever
I just got her, I'm off the shits now
I got yo bitch now, she on my dick now
Chopping a brick now, give me the lick now
Don't give a shit now, I don't give a shit now
That money walk back to me, a diamond walk back to me
And the buzz be back at me, I got the whole industry
That camera walk back at me, I just get money
I'm fucking with Reese Mane, I think this shit funny
I got that tune in, I got that tune in color
I got the bitches, I still got everything on me
They say "what you saying?"
I say it's what I said
If you can't understand, nigga, get the fuck up out my face

[Chorus]
I turn five to a ten
I turn twenty to a fifty
Forty-forty hit your woodie shorty
Balmain, Saint Laurent with the Fendi
I turn five to a ten
I turn twenty to a fifty
Forty-forty hit your woodie shorty
Balmain, Saint Laurent with the Fendi
Whatchu want, tell me whatchu want
(What do you want?)
Like whatchu want, like what do you want?
(What do you want?)
Whatchu want? Let a nigga know
Let a nigga know, let a nigga know

[Verse 2]
Okay hit it like Hussein, then she taking care of him
And she call me baby, that shit be crazy
I'm whipping and whipping, that talk ain't no baby
I beat that pussy 'til it's Forrest Whittaker, I'm not lazy
I don't care though, I'm just crazy
She sucking dick now, stay out the bando
I got these two guns, I feel like I'm Rambo
She playing my dick like she was on saxophone
Call on the telephone, I hang up the telephone
That's shit might be tapped, don't fuck with no telephone
Meet me in person, I'm moving that P
I'm jugging the white, man
I'm serving that white, man
I know
I don't, I don't know
Aye, hahahaha
