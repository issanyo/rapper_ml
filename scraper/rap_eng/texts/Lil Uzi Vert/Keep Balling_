[Verse 1]
I just fucked your bitch, but I do not need her
Yes I must insist, that you should just keep her
Walking with the bands, I don't need no visa
Hundred in my pants
I was on Xanny and I was on Percy, I took that shit like it was Tylenol
I looked at the mirror, I tatted my face and realized I created a monster y'all
Boy you [?] and you got little guap
Watch out [?] copy y'all
Imma keep ballin, I got to stay on top
Imma keep ballin because I cannot stop

[Hook]
Imma keep ballin, Imma keep ballin
Imma keep ballin, Imma keep, Imma keep, Imma keep ballin
Imma keep ballin
Imma keep ballin
Imma keep ballin

[Verse 2]
Swerving that Ford
Swerving that foreign
Got 2 exhausts
Drive till I'm nauseous
Nowadays I'm so heartless
Crocodile [?]
See you later baby alligator [?]
I'm a rockstar, baby yeah I'm a rockstar
