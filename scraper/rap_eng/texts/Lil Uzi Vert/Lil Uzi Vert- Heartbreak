[Intro: Lil Uzi Vert]
Yeah, Yeah
Yeah
Heartbreak
Yah, Yah
Yah, Yah
Heartbreak, Heartbreak, Heartbreak

[Hook: Lil Uzi Vert]
Wake up with the stars
Bad bitches in my room
Only time I got the chance
That's why I told you the truth
Hold up, wait yeah I'm on a roll
Post up with they hoes
Gotta go Just to get them go
Cause I'm on my own

[Hook: Lil Uzi Vert]
Heartbreak, Heartbreak, Heartbreak
Car fast do the dash I'm on my way
Came up from the bottom all the way
Now they looking at me cause I'm not the same

[Verse 1: Lil Uzi Vert]
Yeah
I took off on niggas that hate and made my escape
Not from this state cause I'm from outer space
That bitch she with me get dropped like a snake
All this cash on me I need me a rake
That's why all these bitches be all in my face
But they can not get nothing from me no way
Just trynna get over this heartbreak
Car too fast I hit the brakes
Car too fast I hit the brakes
Too much cash might break the safe
Too much cash might break the bank
I do what I want anything to change
Just trynna keep me from going insane
Wake up everyday as I live through the bape
They plottin on me got me all in the aim
(Me all in the aim) They better not miss
Cause I come with a bang
