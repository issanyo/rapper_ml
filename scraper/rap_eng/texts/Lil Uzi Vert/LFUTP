I fuck that bitch then I'm gone, I fuck that bitch then I'm gone
I fuck that bitch then I'm gone, I fuck that bitch then I'm gone

[Hook: Rizzoo Rizzoo]
Let's fuck up the party, let's fuck up the party
Let's fuck up the party
Stand on the couch and let's get this hoe started
Let's get this hoe started
Pop a few bottles, pop a few bottles
Let's fuck up the party, let's fuck up the party
Let's fuck up the party
We fuck up the party, let's fuck up the party
Let's fuck up the party
Fucked a new model bitch
Throw a few hundreds, throw a few hundreds
We be on drugs, get this hoe in the club
Fuck a few models
Let's fuck up the party, let's fuck up the party
Let's fuck up the party
Let's fuck up the party, let's fuck up the party

[Verse 1: Lil Uzi Vert]
Let's fuck up the party, fuck up the party
I'm drinkin' that Ace of Spades
You're in the club and you're drinkin' Bacardi
You're drinkin' that what?!
Rockin' Margiela, the RICO and then you just rockin' Ed Hardy
Just fine, boy, fine, boy
Jump on your bitch on the road like my name was Jeff Hardy
My name was Jeff Hardy
Might cop the 2235 like a 'Rari
Diamonds in my toother Vandross
My brother movin' had no ass out
You thinkin' tough, know how to get you
Let you live, knock your mans off
Like the ceilin' you get fanned dawg
Your bitch my number one fan, dawg
Quarterback, quarterback, quarterback
Laughin' 'til my team a hand off

[Hook: Rizzoo Rizzoo]

[Verse 2: Rizzoo Rizzoo]
I'm on all type of drugs, I'm fucked up
I came with no bitch, but I'm leaving with some
She wanted to get on them drugs
So now her whole face numb
Sprinkle molly on her tongue, she wanted to have fun
Rizzoo Rizzoo, I'm the flame ignitor
I'm trippin', bitch, I ain't never dabbin'
Prescription drugs all in my cabinet
I'm fuckin' bitches off Versace mattress
I work hard, now I party lavish
This type of shit got all the bitches laughin'
I'm a rockstar, I'm jumpin' in the crowd
Bitches goin' wild, they love my fuckin' style
It's hot, it's hot, it's hot, hot, all the bitches goin' wild!

[Hook: Rizzoo Rizzoo]
