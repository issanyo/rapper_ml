Lyrics from Snippet

[Chorus]
I was at the bottom of the barrel, and now I'm at the top (Let's go)
I cannot stop (Can't stop)
I saw my opps (My opps)
I got the mob (The mob)
Meet me at the trap (Yeah)
But I am no Yung Joc, but it's going down
It's going down
It's going down
It's going down
I was on the drugs all night
I was on the drugs all night
I was on caution zones
Now I got a stick when I'm running

Snippet 2
I had to go get the drop
I had to go get the pants
I had to go get the money
[?]
[?] on a album
Just spent 200 on his Lamb
[?]
Got a Glock so I can't get jammed
What's that? That bitch not my man
What, everybody hates me not my fan
