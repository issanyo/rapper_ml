[Hook: Gucci Mane]
I need a blonde, a blonde ho
Blonde, a blonde ho
It's Gucci Mane and man
That mane just came back from Milan, ho
Blonde, a blonde ho
Blonde, a blonde ho
Won't you go and paint that pussy blonde?
Blonde ho
Blonde, a blonde ho
Blonde, a blonde ho
I heard that blondes have all of the fun
A blonde ho
Blonde, a blonde ho
Blonde, a blonde ho
Baby, won't you change your hair to blonde?
Blonde ho
Blonde, a blonde ho
Blonde, a blonde ho
I'm in the dun, I dropped the top to see the sun
Paint it blonde, ho

[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]
Fishtail in the Phipps plaza, I ran into a blonde ho
Said she wanna fuck with Wop, I took her to my condo
Ain't no numbers on that skin, that chain
Just givin' her what she came for
Her man say she missin', I murked that kitty
Now officially she's a Jane Doe
Plain Jane, Hublot
Fettin' followed by detectives in plain clothes
Bought my Rolls with suicide doors
Jumped in my Benz, the brain go
Got a black girl with blonde hair, green lipstick
She look like a rainbow
All my partners millionaires, man, we all got the same goals
Mr. Chase-The-Bag and I go anywhere that the plane go
Chasin' a check on a private jet, my stewardess a blonde ho
My uzi weighs a ton, I'm public enemy number one, ho
My ex keep goin' down memory lane like Minnie Riperton ho

[Hook: Gucci Mane]
Blonde, a blonde ho
Blonde, a blonde hoo
Won't you go and paint that pussy blonde?
Blonde ho
Blonde, a blonde ho
Blonde, a blonde ho
I heard that blondes have all of the fun
A blonde ho
Blonde, a blonde ho
Blonde, a blonde ho
Baby, won't you change your hair to blonde?
Blonde ho
Blonde, a blonde ho
Blonde, a blonde ho
I'm in the dun, I dropped the top to see the sun
Paint it blonde, ho

[Verse 2: Lil Uzi Vert]
Spanish bitch sniffin' a line, she call it blanco
I feel like Pablo, money El Chapo
Look at my AP, that bitch is so frozen I can't tell the time
Never been overseas so Gucci called me just straight from Milan (How is it?)
Asian bitch on my dick, yeah she lookin' just like she is Mulan
Bust in her face, then she blind
Bust in her hair 'til it's blonde
Drivin' a Royce and it's blind
Drivin' a Royce with the blinds
Tinted so dark that I'm blind
Stay in the cut but ain't hidin'
These hoes be lyin'
I swear that these niggas lyin'
Hundred thousand my medallion
I took your bitch, gave her guidance
I fucked that bitch and she tired
I fucked that bitch and she quiet
Own the pussy, increasin' the violence
