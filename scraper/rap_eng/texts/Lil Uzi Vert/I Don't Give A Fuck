[Chorus: Kur]
I could die drinking this codeine, I don't give a fuck
Get rich with it with my whole team, I don't give a fuck
I could go to jail selling this shit, still won't give a fuck
All the shit I did, I probably go to hell, I don't give a fuck

I could die drinking this codeine, I don't give a fuck
Get rich with it with my whole team, I don't give a fuck
I could go to jail selling this shit, still won't give a fuck
All the shit I did, I probably go to hell, I don't give a fuck

[Verse 1: Lil Uzi Vert]
We working we working
What I sip on be that purpose
Most of these broads they be thirsty
Hundreds and fifties
Yeah I got hundreds and fifties
And your pockets be my numbers
Your bitch in the whip, yeah the one with the curtains
I'm sucking that titty, that bitch'll be nursing
That we I be sippin, my words they be slurring
If first in my water, you know I be skrting
I'm whipping and whipping, the wrist'll be churning
They say it is real, your chain it be turning
And fake niggas only think that I'm allergic
I write on the dotted line, write up in cursive
I'm chalking the outer line when you get murdered
You talking 'bout rapping but I got the burner
And this be the nine, and you can get burnt up
Designer my clothes, side bitch be imported
And shout out the plug, can't look cross the water
I'm up, been in Mexico cause I'm important
What the fuck you gonna do right with a quarter
When I get the clothes, yeah something more hoarder
Don't cop at the mall, everything you order
Got bitches in Jersey all way down to Florida
She sucking me off, she tasting her daughter
And you want it all, but you can't afford it
What I pay for my shoes probably your mortgage
And they say I'm rude, my music is hard up
And credit when due, worked for my grandmomma
And I'm in the field, like Jeremiah Trotter
And I'm going hard, like my name is Flocka
Bandana on neck, like I'm Silkk The Shocker
Put my niggas on, so we all can prosper
Put my niggas on, so we all can prosper

[Chorus: Kur]
I could die drinking this codeine, I don't give a fuck
Get rich with it with my whole team, I don't give a fuck
I could go to jail selling this shit, still won't give a fuck
All the shit I did, I probably go to hell, I don't give a fuck

I could die drinking this codeine, I don't give a fuck
Get rich with it with my whole team, I don't give a fuck
I could go to jail selling this shit, still won't give a fuck
All the shit I did, I probably go to hell, I don't give a fuck

[Verse 2: Kur]
My nigga Dre home
They had him locked like Mandela
My block hot as the motherland
And I still got them grams selling, unh
5-0 can't stop my grind
3 niggas can't stop 4 5s
8 niggas can't stop this 9, uh
AK picking through that block, vert
Saw these niggas and it's 'bout that time
I stand on the corner like I protest
Like I'm tryin' to stop that crime
The thing is, I ain't got no sign, huh
The thing is, I ain't really into black power
Bitches wave a nigga there like I'm a cab driver
Little bitch talking can I come see her
I said no, maybe later, these trap hours
I ain't flexing, stand down, fuck am I clear
And this rap game pussy I'm a pioneer
The white whiter than the people with the blue eyes
And the people with the blonde hair
Any rapper talking like they got fucking problems
I make that pussy fall back like recline chairs
Sharp neck, vernith road, we don't fight c'here
We'll light your ass up like times square
'Bout business I ain't really into small-talking
My niggas ride 'til they crash like Paul Walker
Got shooters got shooters like 'Mal Crawford
Fuck a middleman, point me to the boss office
It's NGB
And it's Daytown
We drink codeine
Like we in H-Town

[Chorus: Kur]
I could die drinking this codeine, I don't give a fuck
Get rich with it with my whole team, I don't give a fuck
I could go to jail selling this shit, still won't give a fuck
All the shit I did, I probably go to hell, I don't give a fuck

I could die drinking this codeine, I don't give a fuck
Get rich with it with my whole team, I don't give a fuck
I could go to jail selling this shit, still won't give a fuck
All the shit I did, I probably go to hell, I don't give a fuck
