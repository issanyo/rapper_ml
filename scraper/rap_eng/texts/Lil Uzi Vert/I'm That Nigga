[Hook]
Flex on niggas, flex on bitches, do my thing
I'm a hitter, money flipper, yous a lame
Diamond fisker, diamond wrist on, water chain
Suicide, doors on fisker, whip insane
I'm that nigga, same old nigga, ain't shit changed
I'm that nigga, same old nigga, ain't shit changed
I'm that nigga, same old nigga, ain't shit changed
Flex on nigga, flex on bitches, do my thing

[Verse 1]
I'mma dick her, I won't kiss her, ain't shit changed
Diamond wrist on, diamond fisker, uh bling bling
Love my pistol, it's an issue, aim at your brain (dont know how to act)
Yeah my brother in the kitchen whip cocaine
Pour up a 4, sippin' lean, got slow brain
Got your bitch in my crib givin' brain
Stay with steel, get your ass, now you stained
My bitch be totin', she a shooter, GI Jane (oh my god)
Want the money, all the money, fuck the fame (oh my god)
Who am I? ask your slut, she know my name (yea, she do)
My bitch live in Augusta, that be Maine (not a lame)
I done flexed up boy, you should do the same

[Hook]
Flex on niggas, flex on bitches, do my thing
I'm a hitter, money flipper, yous a lame (you a lame)
Diamond fisker, diamond wrist on, water chain (water water)
Suicide, doors on fisker, whip insane (fucked your daugther)
I'm that nigga, same old nigga, ain't shit changed
I'm that nigga, same old nigga, ain't shit changed
I'm that nigga, same old nigga, ain't shit changed
Flex on nigga, flex on bitches, do my thing

[Verse 2]
Where the pistol? point the pistol, show the safe (show the safe)
Fuck the cops, fuck the twitters, fuck the jakes (fuck the jakes)
Versace rolls, sippin' Moet, sippin' Ace
Pull up Lambo, hard to handle, well let's race (skrt skrt, race)
You ain't suckin' dick, hoe get out my face
I fuck any bitch no matter the race (any bitch)
I fuck all the strippers, I feel like I'm Drake (with my woes)
I like revolvers better cause the hold the case
And yes indeed Lil Uzi beat the case (oh my god)
Feel her titty, feel like titty with freebase (feel like 2 Chainz)
Don't eat booty, eat her pussy, like the taste (i like the taste)
Shark hoodie, feel like Nigo all these apes
