[Intro: Kodie Shane]
I'm dabbing in (man, this beat so hard)
'Cause we up, we up, we up, we up, we up
Skrt
I just got back from a newer thing
Got Back from L.A. like yesterday
I just got back from a newer thing
Skrt
The top is off, is off, is off, is off, is off, is off, is off
Skrt, skrt
I'm pulling off, I'm off, I'm off, I'm off, I'm off, I'm off, I'm off
Skrt

[Verse 1: Kodie Shane]
I just pulled up in a newer thing
I'm so in love with designer things
Just got back from L.A. like yesterday
And I haven't seen my new place in days
Can somebody please book my flight today?
Oh, you don't know me, must be new to things
I just spent 5 on my pinky ring
And you wanna ride 'cause you know I'm paid

[Pre-Chorus: Kodie Shane]
Yeah, you know I'm paid
Everybody know my name
Satellite on my car
People say I play too hard
Spent an appetite on my chain
Broke nigga, we ain't the same
I like privacy and wings, championship rings

We up, we up, we up, we up, we up, we up, we up, we all up (way up) (yeah)
We up, we up, we up, we up, we up, we up, we up, we all up (way up) (yeah)
