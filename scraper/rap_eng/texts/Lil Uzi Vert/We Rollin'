[Hook: Lil Uzi Vert]
I just took a xan, five more in her hand
Can't stand up, I just took a perc
Now my words are slurred can't manage
We rollin',  rollin',  rollin',  rollin'
Rollin',  rollin',  rollin', we rollin'
Rollin',  rollin',  rollin', we rollin'

[Verse 1: Rome Fortune]
I said rolling rolling rolling
Holding holding holding
God damn that pussy swollen
Omg are you trolling
Yes I like that I like that you like that
You strike back, wait I pipe that
My pipe strapped I wipe that
I contact, skate
I said I'm sittin' on the edge
The intensity and wetness make me kinda bored
You sucka niggas wanna ask me what I'm rhymin' for

[Hook: Lil Uzi Vert]
I just took a xan, five more in her hand
Can't stand up, I just took a perc
Now my words are slurred can't manage
We rollin',  rollin',  rollin',  rollin'
Rollin',  rollin',  rollin', we rollin'
Rollin',  rollin',  rollin', we rollin'

[Verse 2: Rome Fortune]
And now we're smokin' smokin' smokin
Pokin' pokin'
That ass is crazy why are you so damn provokin'
Still I like that, you like that
You want my babies
Is it physical
Or is it cool that  a nigga paid
I said my lips is on your legs and you wanting more
But a nigga used to flip on some [?]
But you don't like [?] dick so

[Hook: Lil Uzi Vert]
I just took a xan, five more in her hand
Can't stand up, I just took a perc
Now my words are slurred can't manage
We rollin',  rollin',  rollin',  rollin'
Rollin',  rollin',  rollin', we rollin'
Rollin',  rollin',  rollin', we rollin'
