[Pre-Hook]
Mr. Balmain with Air Force
That bitch say that she really like my voice
I do not like her like we is divorced
Shut up bitch, don't like your voice
I might just jump in a 'Rari
I might just jump in a Porsche
What them two things got in common?
Them bitches both got the horse (giddy up!)

[Hook]
Hit that bitch straight from the back
That bitch just look like a horse
That bitch she gon' scream my name
Until her throat getting hoarse
Told that bitch suck on my dick
I leave her pussy so moist
You cannot afford this umbrella
You ain't inside of the door on Rolls Royce

[Verse 1]
Automobiles they so foreign
You worrying about a Ford
Nigga tell me how you whipping
I swear I'm using a fork
Boy I swear your money little
Like you related to Stuart
That bitch she lick on the tip
Ain't my baby somebody call the stork
Maxing the Mac-11 with the tripper service
Swear that you don't want war
Shotgun turn you to a smoothie, hit you with the uzi
Swear you don't want war
You a tough pit like a bar
Tell that bitch I got everything in the store
I remember back I was almost poor
Now that bitch pussy pinker than a sore
Tough ass raps they bethey be snitching in court
Gang members they be talking in code like its morse
I'm the type of nigga to handle shit like a dog
You the type of nigga to fall in love with a whore
Back then that bitch said I was a nerd
Now that bitch sucking on the dick of a god
All that got damn money laying on the floor
Pick it up put it away treat it like a chore

[Verse 2]
Margiela made out of cow
Them bitchesmake you feel like a goat
On my neck got fifty thou
Diamond wet just like a boat
Money is sitting in pile
You is upset because you in a hole
I'm spending the most
I swear that thick bitch is doing the most
Rolling with my brother like the master
Choking on her neck anaconda
Roll around with tina on my hip
Who the fuck is that? oh that's just the llama
Fuck on that bitch on her pajamas
Fuck 12 skirt off Panamera
Choke on her tail ruin her mascara
Looking at a millionaire in the mirror
Running the game like a track
Swear you my son, not your dad
VVS on my right wrist
VVS on my left wrist
I just fucked on my right bitch
Then I fuck on my left bitch
That pussy pop like a rari
That pussy yeah it got grip

Until her throat getting hoarse
