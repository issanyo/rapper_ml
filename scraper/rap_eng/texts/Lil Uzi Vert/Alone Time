[Intro]
Middle fingers to my enemies, I hope you die
Middle fingers to my enemies, I hope you die

[Hook]
All these diamonds on my teeth is why I talk like this
Money in my pocket why I walk like this
All this money in my pocket why she stalk like this
I be Rick Owen steppin' better guard your bitch
I already bought your bitch
We did everything, I already bought your bitch
Like this the way I rage on some rockstar shit (raindrops)
Aye rockstar shit
Aye rockstar shit, aye

[Verse 1]
Sharing all these bitches with my bros
All these bitches out here, they be hoes
In the kitchen and they whippin' stoves
With my bitches and they toting poles
I just fucked me like 10 hoes
Stay down with my ten toes
Sharing all my money with my kinfolk
I am so done with the Kenzo jump in Benzo (uh yeah)
Um, Rest in Peace to Speaker Knockers
Got your bitch all on my arm
Like, Lil Uzi he just be wildin'
He got like all of these options, yeah
My new bitch she is a vegan
I just be counting this broccoli
Yah, we got them choppers on choppers
Ain't nobody gonna stop us
I just be lightin the gas, yah
Sometimes Iâ€™m lit with the booth, yah

She just be gone off the boot, yah

Feel like MJ with the moves, yah
Fucking your bitch with my goons, yah
Leave her wet like the pool, yah

[Hook]
All these diamonds in my teeth is why I talk like this

[Verse 2]
All these diamonds in my mouth is why I talk like this
Hundred fifty thousand why I walk like this
Yeah kick my little shit with a rockstar bitch
Yeah turn her right around and give her rockstar dick
That is not your bitch
We be going hard to ignite your bitch
Pass her right to the squad and they bite your bitch
Make her slob on my knob like a ho, like the whole Three 6
On the real, I don't even like your bitch
Ask squad, one night your bitch
Long dick and I'mma pipe your bitch
Long dick and I'mma pipe your bitch
Xan money don't even excite that bitch
Friend zone, I don't even like that bitch
10 hoes, on the real life's so lit
Number one rule, should've never wife'd that bitch
