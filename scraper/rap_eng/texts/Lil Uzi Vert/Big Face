[Chorus: Lil Uzi Vert]
Uh, yeah, Rollie that's big face, yeah
Diamonds flood the face, yeah
Why you kiss her face, yeah
'Cause we dick her face, yeah
Goyard on my waist, yeah
Hundreds they blue face, yeah
Diamonds on my rings, yeah
Xannies ease the pain, yeah

[Verse 1: Lil Uzi Vert]
Bitch I swear this is a Porsche, yeah
Stay up in your lane
I'm whippin' it with my minorities, yeah
Yeah they movin' 'caine, yeah
We don't move the same, yeah
I'ma do my thing, yeah
Better keep your mouth closed
We'll shoot your brain, yeah
Yeah, um this gas got me so high, I thought it was laced
I was outside all the way from the morning
That bitch suck my dick and her tongue got no taste
VVS diamonds, that's all on my face
I'm walkin' right in, I ride with the bank
Raf Simmons, Rick Owens, Mr. Completely
I'm also Jamaican, I shoot with a bay

[Chorus: Lil Uzi Vert]
Uh, yeah, Rollie that's big face, yeah
Diamonds flood the face, yeah
Why you kiss her face, yeah
'Cause we dick her face, yeah
Goyard on my waist, yeah
Hundreds they blue face, yeah
Diamonds on my rings, yeah
Xannies ease the pain, yeah
Rollie that's big face, yeah
Diamonds flood the face, yeah
Why you kiss her face, yeah
'Cause we dick her face, yeah
Goyard on my waist, yeah
Hundreds they blue face, yeah
Diamonds on my rings, yeah
Xannies ease the pain, yeah

[Verse 2: ManMan Savage]
I just beat the case, they don't know my name
They ain't see my face, I ain't leave a trace
If you talkin' 'bout them Franklins let me see his face
If I cop that Rollie you know I'ma flood the face
I just copped a whip, took her on a trip
Fifty in the clip, I'll let it rip
I heard he kissed her lips, my dick was on her lip
That was all bad, seen it all was sad
Nigga you's a lame, better yet a fag
My niggas ran a train, choo choo on her ass
Nutted on her face, and nutted on her ass
I was on a xan, after that I crashed

[Chorus: Lil Uzi Vert]
Yeah, Rollie that's big face, yeah
Diamonds flood the face, yeah
Why you kiss her face, yeah
'Cause we dick her face, yeah
Goyard on my waist, yeah
Hundreds they blue face, yeah
Diamonds on my rings, yeah
Xannies ease the pain, yeah
Rollie that's big face, yeah
Diamonds flood the face, yeah
Why you kiss her face, yeah
'Cause we dick her face, yeah
Goyard on my waist, yeah
Hundreds they blue face, yeah
Diamonds on my rings, yeah
Xannies ease the pain, yeah
