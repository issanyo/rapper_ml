[Chorus]
Started chopping twenty M down to a thirty
I need at least like 3 mill', that's for certain
I'm just working off the lean now I'm swervin'
12 pull a nigga over, trunk got birdies
My trunk got birdies, (my trunk got what?)
Trunk got birdies, (goddamn, goddamn)
That trunk got birdies, (yes, it do)
Shit my trunk got birdies
Shit my trunk got birdies, (my trunk got birdies)
My trunk got birdies, (I got birdies)
My trunk got birdies, (my trunk got birdies)
Damn, my trunk got birdies, (my trunk got birdies)
Trunk got birdies, (trunk got birdies)
Trunk got birdies, (my trunk got birdies)
12 pull a nigga over, trunk got birdies (what the fuck)
My trunk got birdies, (goddamn)
Trunk got birdies, (damn)
12 pull a nigga over, trunk got birdies

[Verse 1]
20 shot forty round
Said, 20 shot for your mans
Hundred grand hundred grand
You ain’t got money flex for the gram
I need ten million fast, I saw how niggas just grab it fast
Last year Monique was in my wallet, this year a nigga be rapping bands
Sipping Ack, a nigga traffickin'
My bitch white but booty African
Where my niggas that be trapping syrup?
Where my niggas that be trapping Xans? (I need it)
If you see me better say that plural
'Cause of my ways with partner and them
Sipping lean catching Z like I'm Zoro
If you talk shit you ain't cop from them
On the beach sipping lean (in Tosias?)
I said what you mean this is Sangria
And if you got wet better get that key up
Cause that Mac 11 shoot like a seizure
And yes I'm finessing just with my feet up
And my bitch bad look like Sacagawea
And I love the pussy but I don’t need her
And I love the pussy but I don’t need her

[Chorus]
Started chopping twenty M down to a thirty
I need at least like 3 mill', that's for certain
I'm just working off the lean now I'm swervin'
12 pull a nigga over, trunk got birdies (my trunk got what?)
My trunk got birdies, (trunk got birdies)
Trunk got birdies, (my trunk got birdies)
That trunk got birdies, (trunk got birdies)
Shit my trunk got birdies, (they do, they do)
Shit my trunk got birdies, (goddamn, goddamn)
My trunk got birdies, (my trunk got birdies)
My trunk got birdies, (my trunk got birdies)
Damn, my trunk got birdies, (my trunk got birdies)
Trunk got birdies, (trunk got birdies)
Trunk got birdies, (my trunk got birdies)
12 pull a nigga over, trunk got birdies (goddamn, goddamn)
My trunk got birdies, (my nigga, my nigga)
Trunk got birdies, (ain't this some shit)
12 pull a nigga over, trunk got birdies

[Verse 2]
They whipping that work, (they whipping that work)
Them niggas was serving (they serve, they serve)
You talking that shit, (you talkin' that what?)
Them niggas will hurt you
And [?] I let it be [?]
And when I sip that, my word they be slurring
And Lil Uzi, bitch
I'm fucking yo bitch
She all in my crib, she sucking my dick
The fucked up thing, you kissing her lips
I’m looking at you, you nasty as shit
My trunk got birdies, my trunk got birdies
I'm fuckin' yo bitch, Versace shades like I’m J Swerve
Yeah I'm killing it, yeah I'm killing it
Yeah I'm finessing, 'cause I'm feeling it
(Lil Uzi, Lil Uzi)

[Chorus]
Started chopping twenty M down to a thirty
I need at least like 3 mill', that's for certain, (I do, I do)
I'm just working off the lean now I'm swervin'
12 pull a nigga over, trunk got birdies (my trunk got what?)
My trunk got birdies, (my trunk got birdies)
Trunk got birdies, (goddamn, goddamn)
That trunk got birdies, (my trunk got birdies)
Shit my trunk got birdies, (it do, it do)
