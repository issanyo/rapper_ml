[Intro]
Birthday, my birthday-

[Chorus]
You would think that I was happy
But I'm not (yo), but I'm not (treat it)
You would think that it's my birthday (birthday)
But it's not (yo), but it's not

[Verse 1]
I treat the minivan like it's a coup√©
I treat the dollar bill like it was two
I spent the last year inside a cocoon
Now I got wings and nothing to lose
I wanna go to your side of the moon
I treat that kitty cat like it were food
I had to thank God that I had a roof
Over my head, thank God for the juice
Birthday boy, birthday boy why is you sad?
Look like my momma than stunt like my dad
Get out my way 'fore I dunk on your ass
Please don't test me, you don't wanna do that
I don't wanna drive so I jumped in the back
They playin' my song like I'm comin' to bat
She threw me a fatty so I took a hit
I do not miss when they sittin' like that
I'm major league when I'm hittin' like that
I tell the money to get in the bag
You can't do number 'less you do the math
So I wanna spend it and get right back (you would think that I was)
Get right back, yeah, get right back
I wanna spend it then get it right back
I wanna spend it then get it right back
Like ooh, get it right back
Ooh, ooh, get it right back
I wanna spend it then get it-, wait, get it- right

[Interlude / Beat Switch]
Yo what'd you do with your birthday money?
Okay

[Bridge]
Hundred on a wrist watch just to tell the time (time out)
Hundred on my baby just so she could shine (shine)
Ice on my neck send chills down my spine
Only way I can tell if I'm still alive

[Chorus: Tobi Lou and Lil Uzi Vert]
You would think that I was happy (It's only my third day out here)
It's-it's- it's my birthday
It's my birthday, yeah
It's my birthday, yeah, it's my-

[Zach Villere]
You would think that I was happy
But I'm not, woah, yeah yeah yeah
You would think that it's my birthday (you would think that it's my birthday)
But it's not, but it's not

[Bridge]
Hundred on a wrist watch just to tell the time (time out)
Hundred on my baby just so she could shine (shine)
Ice on my neck send chills down my spine
Only way I can tell if I'm still alive

[Outro]
It's-it's- it's my birthday
