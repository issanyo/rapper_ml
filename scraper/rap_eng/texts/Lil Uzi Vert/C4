[Verse 1]
Ain't have shit, nigga thats a lie
Even had shit when I was in the ville
I 'member that- fuck the whats his name?
Had his face lookin' like Emmett Till
That was a young nigga
Keep goin' hard for the
Talkin' to the law, that's a rat deal

Me and my boys act dumb
We ain't sayin' shit

In the kitchen
Eatin' crabs
One nigga I give my life for
My own sacrifice for
Man i love you nigga, you that right boul
That's a real nigga
If it don't replay
Real nigga
When I whip the pot like stir fry
I'm doin' deals in the ally way
Man in the chevy with extended folk
I'm sippin' lean and they smokin' dope

Steppin' in my hood, you a dumb mothafucka
And I ain't let it blow cause my lil niggas want you

As a young boy, I wanted that

Steppin' in my hood, you a dumb mothafucka
