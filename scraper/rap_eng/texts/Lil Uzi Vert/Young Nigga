[Intro: Young Thug & Lil Yachty]
Ralo, Young Thugger, Lil Boat (Lil Uzi, Lil Uzi!)
I want everybody in the front
The middle and both of the sides
And even in the back to turn the fuck up
You know what I'm sayin'

[Hook: Ralo  & Young Thug]
Young nigga fly like propellers (fly)
Young nigga stackin' up vegetables
I filled up my life with some schedules
All of my bitches bisexual
They can't knock him off of the block
They can't knock him off of the top
They told him to stop but he not
I'm still sellin' dope out the spot
Young nigga fly like propellers
Young nigga stackin' up vegetables
I filled up my life with some schedules
All of my bitches bisexual
They can't knock him off of the block
They can't knock him off of the top (workin')
They told him to stop but he not
I'm still sellin' dope out the spot
Ralo gon' deal it

[Verse 1: Ralo]
Fuck with my boy and I'll catch me a felon
We'll go to war with whoever, we ready
You know we shoot up the shit to be petty
Didn't mama tell you don't fuck with no gangstas?
You need to go back and tell mama thank you
I shoot this bitch up and I won't move a finger
I keep them shooters with me, every angle
Young nigga flyer than Superman
I got more choppers than Yucat√°n
These niggas faker than Boogieman
I get in the kitchen I'm cookin' man
I whip up that dope and I whip me a Lamb'
Whoever try me I'm never gon' spare em
They better ask about who I am
I pull up on you and I won't give a damn
Young nigga, young nigga, young nigga
It's too much money for one nigga
We do not run from no one, nigga
Come get your bitch when I'm done with her
I make a ugly ho think that she pretty
I make a friendly bitch think saditty
I make these niggas think they run the city
They go against me then we hurt their feelings

[Hook: Ralo  & Young Thug]
Young nigga fly like propellers (fly)

[Verse 2: Lil Yachty]
Ralo, Young Thugga, Lil Boat (Lil Boat)
I'm a lil' different, my money lil' larger
I don't drive no Charger, I beat all my charges
Now I do commercials, I'm so controversial
Everytime they see me, they hatin'
They hate when I win but they love when I sin
These niggas gon' wake the man that's within
Boy by your looks I can tell you cappin'
Boy by your looks I can tell you a pussy
Thought it was soft then he saw who was with me
Don't you dare to try put me with the rookies
That boy ain't dead so he finna play hooky
He hidin', he scared, that boy shake in his boots
I can tell pussy run deep in your roots
I can tell you don't got guap like the Jews
I can tell you don't got guap like I do
Got a fist full of diamonds a neck full of water
Ballin' so hard, change my name to Vince Carter
Not ever once in my life have I ever rode MARTA
This year I just might have to cop me a charter
Thugga my nigga, I swear that's my partner
Ralo Famgoon, don't nobody go harder
Lil Boat the king of the teens and I'm smarter
I'm not 21 but I'll slaughter your daughter, bitch

I whip that dope in the eighties
I beat that bitch like I'm Ike
No I'm not scared of you baby (na)
We can get down any night
And yeah I'm still reppin' Haiti
Yeah we run round with these mice
Young nigga fly like propellers
I might not fuck Cinderella
I filled up my life with some schedules
I know these bitches gon' tell it
They can't knock him off of the block (they can't)
I know lil shawty gon' sell it
They told him to stop, but he not
I know lil shawty won't deal it
Ralo gon' deal it
Chop up that boy with machetes
Shoppin' sprees when I'm ready
That pussy is pink like a pig 'cause she red (sheesh, what?)
Them M&M's all on her body, look like she ready
