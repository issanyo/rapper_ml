[Intro: Quavo]
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah (Yah)
Yeah, yeah, yeah (Ooh)

[Chorus: Quavo & Travis Scott]
One more ride (Ride)
One more race (Race)
We go all out (All out)
We don't play
One more ride, one more race
We don't slow down, ain't no brakes (Ooh)
I'ma go off (Yah, yah)
I'ma ride tonight (Yah)
It don't matter what we face (Yah)
I'ma go off (Straight up)
I'ma ride tonight (Yah)
I'm the master of my fate (Ooh)
I'ma go off (Yah)
I'ma go off (Go off)
I'ma go off (Yah)
I'ma go off
Yah, I gotta go now

[Verse 1: Quavo]
Takin' off and I'm ridin' on the road now
Hit the gas, no brakes, gotta go now
Put my life on the line, yeah, it's on me
Blood rushin' through my veins, no IV
Ride, switchin' lanes, you can't stop me
You can smell the propane when you pass me (Propane)
Ride for the gang because I'm the chief (Gang, gang)
Helicopter hoverin', it's high speed
Chase, drive, straight (Drive)
I'ma, race, to the, cake (Cake, drive)
Flame, on it, no chain, on me (On me)
All of, us, became, homies

[Chorus: Quavo & Travis Scott]
One more ride (Ride)
One more race (Race)
We go all out (All out)
We don't play
One more ride, one more race
We don't slow down, ain't no brakes (Ooh)
I'ma go off (Yah, yah)
I'ma ride tonight (Yah)
It don't matter what we face (Yah)
I'ma go off (Straight up)
I'ma ride tonight (Yah)
I'm the master of my fate (Ooh)
I'ma go off (Yah)
I'ma go off (Go off)
I'ma go off (Yah)
I'ma go off
Yah, I gotta go now

[Verse 2: Travis Scott]
Nine-nine, nine-nine (Yah)
You're rockin' with the ether child in overdrive (Yah, yah)
Yeah, yeah, I-5 to I-9
We go all night, yeah (Ooh, straight up)
Double 0 speed, double 0 Chevy (Yah)
I hit the fourth gear, hope I don't drift (Yah, yah)
Souped up cars all around me (Yah, yah)
Hot-boxin' at a high speed (Yah, yah)
One lane drivin' (Ooh-ooh, yah)
Bad thing 'side me (Ooh-ooh, yah)
One more time on the road (It's lit)
One more time 'fore we go (Straight up)

[Chorus: Quavo & Travis Scott]
One more ride (Ride)
One more race (Race)
We go all out (All out)
We don't play (Go off)
One more ride, one more race
We don't slow down, ain't no brakes (Ooh)

I'ma ride tonight (Yah)
It don't matter what we face (Yah)
I'ma go off (Straight up)
I'ma ride tonight (Yah)
I'm the master of my fate (Ooh)
I'ma go off (Yah)
I'ma go off (Go off)
I'ma go off (Yah)

Yah, I gotta go now

[Verse 3: Lil Uzi Vert]
Gotta go now (Go)
Gotta go, swervin' in my whip can't slow down (Go, skrrr)
Drivin' fancy cars, boy, I'm on the road now (Hmm)
Automatic start, my Vic take a code now (Now)
Yuh, rockstar, heavy metal, no guitar (Guitar)
Why you pay so much for yo' Nissan? Because it's GTR (R)
First, I shift it, click it, burnin' rubber like I'm movin' dark (Yah)
Drive at night, I chop my top so I can relate to the stars
Yeah, relate to the stars
I'ma race you for a pink slip
I got nitrous in my car so tell me what you thinkin'
My adrenaline start pumpin' so I been stopped blinkin'

[Chorus: Quavo & Travis Scott]
One more ride (Ride)
One more race (Race)
We go all out (All out)
We don't play (Go off)
One more ride, one more race
We don't slow down, ain't no brakes (Ooh)
I'ma go off (Yah, yah)
I'ma ride tonight (Yah)
It don't matter what we face (Yah)
I'ma go off (Yah)
I'ma go off (Go off)
I'ma go off (Yah)
I'ma go off
Yah, I gotta go now
