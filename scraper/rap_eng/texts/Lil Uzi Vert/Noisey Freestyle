You so mad you can't hold on my bitch
Need that money I get it like this
Told that bitch that my diamonds like bliss
Told that bitch that she can't give me kiss
I might go down right in on my bitch
Told that bitch that I am and I did it
I feel like Wanda, yeah, I'm gon' wish
All that money I get it like this
[?]
Bad bitch and she all on my side
Uh, fuck that bitch right in my ride
Uh, yuh [?]
