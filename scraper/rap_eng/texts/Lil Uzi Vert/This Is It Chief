[Hook: Lil Tracy]
Put my dick in a whore (woo), and she love it of course (of course)
Then I hop on my horse (yeehaw), yeah I dipped in a Porsche
My diamonds is wet, they dripping like rain, rain, rain (drip, drip)
Three bitches give me brain, brain, brain
Put my dick in a whore, and she love it of course
Then I hop on my horse (yeehaw), yeah I dipped in a Porsche
My diamonds is wet, they dripping like rain, rain, rain
Three bitches give me brain, brain, brain

[Verse 1: Lil Tracy]
I done took a lot of drugs in my days (facts)
I made my doctor's hair turn fucking grey (my bad)
I wish they let my fucking dawg out the cage (bark, bark)
He don't even know I got tats on my face (damn)
I'm a snake in the grass, I'm eating you rats (yeah)
Louis the bag, Ksubis full of some cash (racks)
My money is clean (clean), I live like a king (king)
My bitch is a queen (okay), but she can't get a ring
How the fuck you sign a deal and you ain't shit
I ain't put my hands on her but I hit (yeah)
Try to walk a mile in my shoes, you gon' trip (you gon' trip)
You was so cool in high school now you ain't shit
