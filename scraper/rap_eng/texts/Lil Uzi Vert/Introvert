[Intro]
Uhh, uh
Walkin' around with a bank
Walkin' around with a bank
Walkin' around with a bank

[Chorus]
Didn't trust broad from beginning
Don't fuck with none of these women
I done fucked all of these women
If the pussy ain't wet, then I'm just leavin'
Diamonds so wet, Louboutins they be slippin'
Rockstar like Balmain jeans, they just be rippin'
Lime and the coconut lean when I'm sippin'
Water the soda, the ice, yeah, I'm whippin'
Water the soda, the ice, yeah, I'm whippin'

[Verse 1]
Stackin' my money, I'm countin' this paper (woo)
You fuck with me, .223 bullet in chamber (yeah, yeah)
I promise you, leave your girl 'round me, I'll take her (I'll take her!)
She didn't wanna lick her Lil Uzi, now had taste it
Faded I put down my dough, I don't really be chasin' (uhh)
LA with me, yeah, that nigga just fuck with the chasers (woo)
Baby, that ass fit we wanna really see you shake it (yeah, yeah)
Swerve in the coupe and I'm countin' that money, no charts
She said, "Lil Uzi, I swear that your voice make me moist"
She suck me like Kirby, pockets on excursion
I'm drivin' up in the Rolls Royce (I do!)
I'm countin' money when I'm bored (I'm countin', I'm countin')
Stop countin' money 'cause that's what I do when I'm bored
If you ain't really good at this shit, nigga, then what is the point?
I live in her Gucci, I be in the pussy, in that bedroom feel like I'm Floyd

[Interlude]
Uh, uhh, uhh
[Japanese clip plays]
Uh, uhh, uhh

[Chorus]
Didn't trust broad from beginning
Don't fuck with none of these women
I done fucked all of these women
If the pussy ain't wet, then I'm just leavin'
Diamonds so wet, Louboutins they be slippin'
Rockstar like Balmain jeans, they just be rippin'
Lime and the coconut lean when I'm sippin'
Water the soda, the ice, yeah, I'm whippin'
Water the soda, the ice, yeah, I'm whippin'

[Bridge]
Ohh, ohh, ohh
Ohh, ohh, ohh
Yeah, ohh, yeah

[Verse 2]
I'm off the Xan', she off Roc'
Trunk in the front of my car
I met the slut at the bar
I fucked the slut at the bar
Strummin' that pussy guitar
Smashin' that bih' like a tar
Shots on your bitch like JR
But in my wallet, Goyard
Raf Simmons steppin' on ya
Margielas steppin' on ya
Rick Owens steppin' on ya
All of these diamonds, I swear you can see in the dark (see in dark)
I am not regular, baby girl, you're with a star (you're with a star)
I am ballinâ€™ like I am Derrick Rose
I be ballin' like I miss Amber Rose
Luv is Rage, jump in a crowd at my shows

[Chorus]
Didn't trust broad from beginning
Don't fuck with none of these women
I done fucked all of these women
If the pussy ain't wet, then I'm just leavin'
Diamonds so wet, Louboutins they be slippin'
Rockstar like Balmain jeans, they just be rippin'
Lime and the coconut lean when I'm sippin'
Water the soda, the ice, yeah, I'm whippin'
Water the soda, the ice, yeah, I'm whippin'
