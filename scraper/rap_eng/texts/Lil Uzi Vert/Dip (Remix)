[Intro]
Hit that hoe like 10K, uh

[Verse 1]
You not my homie, no no no
You not my homie, you do not know me
Got a bitch on me, she is Cambodian (wah)
I get the guap, nigga you know it (woah)
I got a Glock, it got a stick (woah)
It got a mop, like a custodian (woah)
I got the sauce, you bitches soak in it (woah, woah)
I got the sweet aromatic with dope in it (woah, woah)
My patek is so wet, it's so clean, put some soap in it (woah, woah)
I went in Gucci, and I'm closing it (woah)
I went in Louis, and I'm closing it
You went in Prada, and you stole from it (woah)
Ok, she gave me the pussy I float in it
Ok, she do not like root beer, got coke in it
Ok, her skin is so smooth cause she lotion it
Grrr kada boom, lil bitch I'm totin' it (grr kada boom)
Pikachu, Bulbasaur, Charmander
I'll make you lean, but you ain't drinkin' no Fanta
Walk off the scene with a sawed off and no handle
Gucci my scene and my pocket got four M's
C.B. on me so I felt like I'm Santana
Only thing Burberry probably my bandana
Audemar P so I cannot [?]
How I feel bout them xans the way I feel bout a ham sandwich
Fuck them girls together, make them just can can
Them girls is nasty enjoyed every damn minute
Ball on a portable court with the sand in it
Everything clear in the port when I land in it
She said "I want you, you, you, you and you"
She said "I want Rock, Mean and Stizzy too"
Pulled up to the block, I got the same Gucci as you
Slime disease, I snot, achoo
I got the vision (woo), all the shit I saw I swear I need counseling
Keep talking shit then my niggas gon' cancel
Sip on that faygo had to give Fanta up
Yuh, that shit was hard
Like a 12 year old tryna give santa up
Black and white diamonds boy gotta get that panda up
Im rocking bears [?]

[?] on my neck, the one with the clam in it
Got a old hellcat but engine got lamb in it
Rubber band man, but yo ass do not got no bands in it
Never been pussy, any problem handle it
Light yo ass up and we probably get yo candle lit
Double CC and that shit on my sandal bitch
Pull up, big B and this shit some outlandish shit
New little bitch...
