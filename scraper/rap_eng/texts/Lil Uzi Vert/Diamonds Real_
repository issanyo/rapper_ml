Lil Uzi Vert:
Boy stole my style, that mean he my child
Wait, like my bitch hot no mild
That bitch cut till a nigga pipe down
Oh boy your pockets frail
You better weigh your scale
Head first they take it for real
But boy the hate is real

Half of my diamonds white
Half of my diamonds teal
I said half of your diamonds fake
Half of your diamonds real
I don't know what to say
I don't know how to feel
Imma keep getting cake
