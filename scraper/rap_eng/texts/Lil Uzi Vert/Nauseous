[Verse 1: Lil Uzi Vert]
That bitch freaky my dick gave that hoe a face lift
Mix the lean with the cream soda you should taste this
I do not smoke with no white hoe cause they lace shit
But I do fuck on that white hoe then I taste it
She said Uzi your dick way too big, bitch shut up take it
You know Wiz gave me some of that KK and I faced it
I be higher than the stars might pull up in spaceship
Your bitch lookin at the stars when I'm in the Wraith bitch
I just fucked on dyke bitch man that shit amazing
Put my dick right in that bitch pussy wet like lake
Lil Uzi hot like the sun or something saw that bitch walk like huma huma
Fifty to hundred the comma comma
Thats that master money with butter butter
Steak and the lobster with sauce
Put some racks in my damn pocket
My mom wanted me to go right to college
So much money can build a damn college
Hundred fifty on my damn collar
Look like I won the damn lotto
I'm shootin' at you with them damn hollows
Got the combo ain't [?]  a damn dollar

[Verse 2: LAMB$]
Fast car, nascar wet paint, loud pipes
SS, big block, tip top, big knot
Glizzy with the clip chopper with the stick
Try to play me pussy I'mma let it spit
I'm with Uzi Vert, we about to vert
Put you on a shirt, aye
Smokin' purp aye
Rounds in the chopper, move like a mobster
Steak and the lobster, shrimp with the pasta
Lean out the pint, might drink the pint
I got this ice, oh look at all of this ice
