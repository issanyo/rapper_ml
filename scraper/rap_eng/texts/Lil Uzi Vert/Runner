[Intro: Maaly Raw]
That, that, that, that, th-that be Maaly Raw

[Chorus: Lil Uzi Vert]
Yeah, um, I just be stackin' my money
I just be countin' my money (Goddamn)
Yeah, walkin' around with these hundreds
Somebody show my opponents
Yeah, I fucked your bitch on a Monday
I put that dick in her stomach
Yeah, I turned that bitch to a runner
I turned that bitch to a runner
Yeah, I turned that bitch to a runner
I turned that bitch to a runner
Yeah, I turned that bitch to a runner
I turned that bitch to a runner
Yeah, I turned that bitch to a runner
I turned that bitch to a runner
Yeah, most of you niggas be funny
Only talk to me 'bout money

[Verse 1: Lil Uzi Vert]
Yeah, smile with my grin, now it's sunny
Smile with my grin, now it's sunny
Ayy, nowadays I'm gettin' money
Eatin' my eggs little runny
Ayy, nowadays I'm takin' xannys
That shit turned me to a junkie
Yeah, I fucked your bitch
She sucked my dick and that ho got a donkey
Ayy, if you fight me and beat me
Pussy nigga better off me
Yeah, choppers, they come with the stick
Put your ass right in the coffin
Yeah, better yet come with your clip
Hit your stomach, now you nauseous
Fuckin' your bitch, I'm a boss
Usin' my defense, go straight through an offense
Diamonds so heavy on teeth
'Cause I swear to God I don't do the talkin'
Raf Simons heavy on feet
'Cause I swear to God I don't do the walkin'
Smokin' this gas, I can't breathe
That's the reason a lil' nigga keep coughin' (Yeah, coughin')
Yeah I'm takin' these Xans, I can't see
But it's still Cartier right when I'm stoppin'

[Chorus: Lil Uzi Vert]
Yeah, um, I just be stackin' my money
I just be countin' my money (Goddamn)
Yeah, walkin' around with these hundreds
Somebody show my opponents
Yeah, I fucked your bitch on a Monday
I put that dick in her stomach
Yeah, I turned that bitch to a runner
I turned that bitch to a runner
Yeah, I turned that bitch to a runner
I turned that bitch to a runner
Yeah, I turned that bitch to a runner
I turned that bitch to a runner
Yeah, I turned that bitch to a runner
I turned that bitch to a runner
Yeah, most of you niggas be funny
Only talk to me 'bout money

[Verse 2: A$AP Ant + Lil Uzi Vert]
Turned that bitch straight to a runner
Turned that bitch straight to a runner
Takin' a flight to London
Takin' a flight to London
Turned that bitch straight to a runner
Turned that bitch straight to a runner
Takin' a flight to London
Takin' a flight to London
Dump at you more than Count Dracula
Callin' my style spectacular
Suckin' me off like Dracula
D magic are like abracadabra
Walk in the spot and I set that bitch off
Coppin' that Ricky, donâ€™t care what the cost
I hear you niggas, you takin' the sauce
Cash money on me, my diamonds go bling
Been rockin' designer
I've been rockin' designer
Damn, Acne jean jacket
Yeah, with the Rick Owens to match, I'm fly
Yeah, um, pull out that MAC
Um, if you gon' pull on my racks
Whippin' that shit and I whip in that shit
And I stay in the trap

[Chorus: Lil Uzi Vert]
Yeah, um, I just be stackin' my money
I just be countin' my money (Goddamn)
Yeah, walkin' around with these hundreds
Somebody show my opponents
Yeah, I fucked your bitch on a Monday
I put that dick in her stomach
Yeah, I turned that bitch to a runner
I turned that bitch to a runner
Yeah, I turned that bitch to a runner
I turned that bitch to a runner
Yeah, I turned that bitch to a runner
I turned that bitch to a runner
Yeah, I turned that bitch to a runner
I turned that bitch to a runner
Yeah, most of you niggas be funny
Only talk to me 'bout money
