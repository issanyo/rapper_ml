Yea I'm walkin' with them racks
Yea I'm walkin' with them stacks
Watch I make it right back
And my uzi all black
Walk around with the MAC

But I see right through ya
Now my crib got a pool
Now a nigga livin' cool
Water, water on my jewels
Phillip Lim on my shoes
Yeah, I'm a winner not a loser
It was really nice to know ya
I can see right through ya

[Verse 1]
Yeah, mix it up in a double cup
Cuz gettin' so screwed up
Life gettin' so screwed up
Diamonds hittin', they look blue ya
You got rhinestones, you can't fool us
Brought my side bitch, I'ma put up
Mix my young bitches with cougars
Fool us, no you can not fool us
Yeah, talk to my shooter
They say they need some more ruler
She better follow my rule
Diamonds so cool like a cooler
Yeah, thumb through the money, right through it
All of my money is blue ya
What's her name don't know she new
Yea don't have a DJ Clue
Counting money help my mood
Yea you know

Y'all always copy my flow
Adam Sandler with my clique like remote
Put 'em on pause
Diamonds they wet like a boat
Diamonds they wet like a boat
Diamonds they wet like a boat
Countin' this money keep goin'
Watch me, I’m hittin' my shoulder
Watch me, I’m hittin' my shoulder
Watch me, I’m hittin' my shoulder

[Hook]
Yea I'm walkin' with them racks

Now a nigga livin' cool
Water, water on my jewels
Phillip Lim on my shoes

[Verse 2]
Spending that money at Dovers
This is a Range not a Land Rover
I keep it clean
Inside peanut butter outside mint green
I never been overseas
But got some girls from overseas
Yea you know what I mean
Fly 'em first class so I can uhm just see 'em
One night with me she just want to leave him
I told her that she really should keep him
Cause he hold her down and he good people
She said her love for me is not equal
We are the same but I'm just a little higher like Bugatti and Beetle
Know I told you I would never leave you
Ok hit that thing right in that fetal
Me and my boys walk across the street with them suits on feel like The Beatles
I heard you chain was a rental
I love my ring like I'm Smeagol
Yea I stay sharp like a needle
Yea I'm so high like an eagle
I pulled up in that two seater
Put my cousin in a Beamer
I got money I don't need her
Rest in peace Miss Cleo
Cause she know I'm just gon' read her
Rest in peace to Cleo
Used to set it off in Neiman's
Whip it up now they fiendin'
Nowadays I fight my demons
Drink soda like Kel got dreads like Kenan

[Hook]
Yea I'm walkin' with them racks
Yea I'm walkin' with them stacks
Watch I make it right back
And my uzi all black
Walk around with the MAC
It was really nice to know ya
But I see right through ya
Now my crib got a pool
Now a nigga livin' cool
Water, water on my jewels
Phillip Lim on my shoes
Yeah, I'm a winner not a loser
It was really nice to know ya
I can see right through ya
