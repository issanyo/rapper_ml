[Hook: William Aston]
I'm feeling good, I'm looking better
Ahhhh, look at me in this lovely weather
I'm making moves just to get the cheddar
Now that I'm looking at it I can't think of nothing better
Steaktown, Steaktown
Now that I'm looking at it I can't think of nothing better
Steaktown, Steaktown
Now that I'm looking at it I can't think of nothing better

[Verse: William Aston]
Snapbacks I rock that
Benz coupe I drop that
Let the fresh air hit ya breast there
Where I'm from? Iraq
No don't get too attached girl, cuz your boyfriend â€“ I'm not that
Let the wrist speak, let the whip speak
Let your chick speak, top that
Oh I think I'm superman cause your girl screaming like a rooster man
Had me up in her new sedan
I don't think that you can recoupe that man
Was she stupid man, rocking the war paint like Legion of Doom
Put it on your life before you blink twice
Blink twice she's in my room

[Hook: William Aston]
I'm feeling good, I'm looking better
Ahhhh, look at me in this lovely weather
I'm making moves just to get the cheddar
Now that I'm looking at it I can't think of nothing better
Steaktown, Steaktown
Now that I'm looking at it I can't think of nothing better
Steaktown, Steaktown
Now that I'm looking at it I can't think of nothing better

[Verse: Lil Uzi Vert]
Codeine and lots of sprite
Codeine and lots of sprite
Got my body feelin' alright
Got a loose bitch but that pussy tight
Oh no, oh no, stupid niggas stupid hoes
You already know bitch I do what I suppose
Then I throw a couple dollars while she sliding down that pole
Yeah the sour I devour
Yeah them diamonds got me froze
White bitch cookin' up that nose
Pussy petal like a rose
Jeremy Scotts up on my feet
And put socks up on my toes

[Hook: William Aston]
I'm feeling good, I'm looking better
Ahhhh, look at me in this lovely weather
I'm making moves just to get the cheddar
Now that I'm looking at it I can't think of nothing better
Steaktown, Steaktown
Now that I'm looking at it I can't think of nothing better
Steaktown, Steaktown
Now that I'm looking at it I can't think of nothing better

[Verse 3: A.Y.]
I grab the Mac and let the ??? bust
??? shells are on the ground
He is in the heavens
Body is on the ground
Told them to kiss the sevens
Ambition strictly for first, 'Rari for second ???
Rejection never accept it
Mind and body connection
Allow it for me to bless 'em
??? made a lesson ???
Teachin' this niggas lessons
??? Answering every question
Now it turns into a mission nigga
