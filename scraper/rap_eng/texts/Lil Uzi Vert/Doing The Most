[Hook]:
Lil bitch she checkin' on you, I get the guap, I flex on you, ooh
She suck my dick with no tooth, not in her house, right in the coupe ooh
Diamonds they black, they ain't blue, with the white in it like Pepé Le Pew, ooh
I took that bitch in her room, I can't just hit one I gotta hit two
You know I'm doing the most
You know she call me the goat
I put my dick in her throat
Then gotta say buenas noches

[Verse]:
I flood my chain it's a choker
Dick in her throat, it's gon' choke her
Yeah her last boyfriend so broke (uh)
Lil Uzi, rich like stock broker, aye
My new bitch straight off the poster
Skin the same color as mocha
On your block, watch how I post up
Real nigga just like a poster (uh)
Up on my bread I might toast ya
My new gun came with a holster
This is a Lamb' not a Lotus, uh
I put a 12 in a Roadster, um
'Member I couldn't get a token, yah
Pocket so fat that they pokin', yah
I had to go count up a check today
Rollie got diamonds, I flex today
No she did not give the sex away
But I heard she gave the neck away
Found out that boy was extra fake
Always love him 'cause that extra cake
24 hours, get extra baked
Now I gotta give my tech away
Gucci my jeans and these Prada my waist
Now that bitch tryna molest my face
Fucked your lil bitch so I rest my case
357 he rest that
Pull up with sticks hit em, extra case
I got the sauce, I got extra taste
Now I'm movin' smart, I can't lose (I can't lose)
I just want 'em all, I can't chose (I can't chose)
I put plus ones in my jewels (in my jewels)
Went to the stars, mars, then the moon (and the moon)
Get the work in for my homies
Get the work right in the morning
She eat it up 'till I'm snoring
I beat it up 'till it's boring
Diamonds look like when you open your eyes in the mornin'
The crack of dawnin'
I turned to a star, man
My new crib it got a doorman
I know some niggas that's warrin'
Poppin' it out for like 4 bands
These bitches they be recordin'
My money stretch out like accordion
See, accordin' to my plans
Couple more months, I will be the man
