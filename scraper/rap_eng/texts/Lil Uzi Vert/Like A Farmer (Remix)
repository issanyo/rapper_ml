[Verse 1: Tracy]
Yeah, don't come 'round here
We don't like your kind (Don't like your kind)
I've been fuckin' these sluts, but I love my wife (But I love my wife)
Got a big ol' truck, so we all gon' ride
I'm sippin' lean like a Coors Light (Yah, yah)
Boy, this town ain't big enough for the both of us
I got a shotgun, ridin' shotgun and it's loaded up (Grrahh)
I heard that whore say, "You handsome"
Put that heat to your face, I'ma brand ya (I'ma brand ya)
Hell yeah, yeehaw (Yeehaw)

He want beef, I'ma have to get him slaughtered

He want beef, I'ma have to get him slaughtered

[Verse 2: Lil Uzi Vert]
Gotta trip, new coupe, follow her own roots (Yeehaw)
Wrangler on my jeans, on belt buckles, no jewels
Bless your heart, you're fixin' to lie
You're cute as a button, but don't got fake boobs
Yes, I have a tractor, you don't like to fly
Took her on a trip to Texas, treat it like Dubai
I'm in Colorado Springs like I'm in Bora Bora (Bora Bora)
We get Tyson money, sell the chicken by the quarter
We don't eat lobster, but we fish
Got a lot of land in Georgia
Just in case of a storm, girlies all up in my bunker in Florida
I planted a seed, I declare what's gonna come out of the soil
Not talkin' 'bout no lean, but we got that mud, I'm sellin' oil

[Chorus: Tracy & Lil Uzi Vert]
I got horses in my car like a farmer (Yeehaw, like a farmer)
Yeehaw, finna pick up your daughter (Yeehaw, yeehaw)
He want beef, I'ma have to get him slaughtered (Yeehaw, get him slaughtered)
He want beef, I'ma have to get him slaughtered (Yeehaw)
I got horses in my car like a farmer
Yeehaw, finna pick up your daughter (Your daughter)
He want beef, I'ma have to get him slaughtered (Get him slaughtered)
He want beef, I'ma have to get him slaughtered (Get him slaughtered)
