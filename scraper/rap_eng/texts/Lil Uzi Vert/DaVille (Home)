[Bridge]
I just know
What I know
If you run up on that shit boy
I just know you gotta go
I said if you tryna run my place
[?]
Im going home
Home
I can put you down my phone
[?]
[?]

[Chorus]
Know I gotta keep my boys close
Guess [?] my lifetime ok I was told
Everything that shine, really ain't full of gold
And you know [?] stood right to the oath
Everyday in the 16 baby
I’m cradling my home
[?] on my wasteline baby, I'm on my own
Brand new grill no riddle baby
All cash no loan
Sign language 2019
I can talk with no phone
My boys that ain't move no bricks
They not touching no stones
Ohh

[Verse]
Touch my back
Ok yeah girl touch my wrist
Watch me, please
I got, I got, I got friends that get me gifts
Who is this?
That’s my boy, ever since dirty matresses
Fuck the actress bitch
When I'm done I just gave her my ass to kiss
Imma [?] down on the block
I don't know what like it is
Francisville [?] that's the [?]
Fill her like some activis
You know that we gettin' blue
Broke boy till we knock the pills
Niggas scared of they own selves
Cause I ain't get shot on accident
No, no, no
Don't ask again
I told bro they money long
No worry we get to them racks again
I'm from the bottom [?]
Been in my block [?]
[?]
[?] she can’t find her man
Oh no
I’m on the six [?]
I'm on the six [?]
