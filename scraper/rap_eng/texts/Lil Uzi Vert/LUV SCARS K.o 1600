Damn, DJ Plugg, you just killed it

[Hook]
So much water on my neck might need a boat or something
So many different girls I got a load of 'em (yeah!)
Why you always hating, go and get you some
Girl, why you always tripping when you know it's love
Walk around, Cuban link, my Patek is flooded
Now my pockets super deep, flooded with them hundreds (ooh!)
Flooded with them hundreds (damn!)
Flooded with them hundreds
What you thought it was?

[Verse 1]
And it's sixteen-hundred
Try to take my soul my young niggas they coming
I remember when they said that I was nothing
I can't trust my brother, I can't trust my cousin
No, let me take my time
I want every girl like I can't make my mind
I spent eighty-thousand just to flood the time
I don't wear no Hanes, my T-shirt Saint Laurent
I just made a whole bag from like half of a show
I still got some boys sad, moving bags of the dope
Yeah you know I got that cash, you get blast on the low
Just because you knew my dad don't mean that I play you close

[Verse 2]
I've been by myself so I'm not losing health
I don't need you niggas, look like you can't tell
Can't do nothing around you 'cause we know you 'gone tell
Niggas I grew up with got a five-star room in Hell
Wait, cause they not loyal
Can't believe we grew up in the soil
(fuck nigga, fuck nigga, fuck nigga!)
Tell my niggas I got them with lawyers
Man, I wish I would knew I would have warned ya
(woulda warned you!)
Man, I wish I would knew I would have warned ya
They killed Ninety right there on the corner
I miss Chico I swear that's my brother
Looking down on me right with his mother
