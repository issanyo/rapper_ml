[Intro: Lil Uzi Vert & Young Jordan]
Sliggity-slimes they slatt
Gucci knapsack on my back
Sliggity-slimes they slatt
Gucci knapsack on my back
Slicey, yah, so icy, slime
Sliggity-slime
Slime, slime (Oh)

[Verse 1: Young Jordan]
I'ma pull up in a Range Rover
I be with slime they some king cobras
Sippin’ that lean make you lean over
I been at the bank, got a mean oder
Put on the Dior but the clean odor
V-12 got a mean motor
Bend her over put that D on her
Sippin’ the act with the cream soda
Say it’s you and your friend gotta bring her over
I got wiser since I got older
Diamonds water yea they got froze
Make a nigga go brazy, Magnolia
If it’s water then I gotta deep stroke her
Sippin’ lean made a nigga lean over
Whole thing made the nigga lean over
Bitch, your slime wasn't real, keep close
YSL, diamond choker
He look icy like the ocean
Saint Laurent that’s on my coat
I got wiser I got older
I keep it on me yes I told you
So you know I ain’t stoppin’ at the red light
Main bitch Make a move round the midnight
Now I’m hoping' on them jets for the red eye
Got ya bitch tryna bi like a pay type
Tryna call a nigga slatt, better say it right
Got some rounds with the ops we gon' air it out
And I got them free slimes that don’t play around
In the club wit ya bitch wit her leg up
All this ass, all this molly ima lay it up
Got some M’s on the way I ain’t sayin nun
You can clean it up why you ain’t sayin nun
Ayy I send the text he gon spray it up
You know slatt, he ain’t gon play around
Got that choppa with that hundred rounds
Send them shots and put a hundred down
Supreme mags, put two hundred on it
It’s high fashion spend some money on it
Wrist two thousand, there's some hundreds on it
(Ohh, Ohh)

[Verse 2: Lil Uzi Vert]
I'm gonna let that girl hold this
She put the work in the mornin’
She used to feel on my boner
Nowadays give me cold shoulder
That shit hurt feelings, might go nuts
Yeah that girl she got me caught up
She sucking me, fuck like a pornstar
I’m passin that girl right to Jordan
Switch it they whorin'
Fuck that girl right till the morning
Ecstasy, race, i'm Jeff Gordon
I fuck that bih till it’s boring
I bought the wraith right off tourin
She said she love me, no moron
I count the blue just like Corbin
223 on me no carbine (Yah)
Count it up it’s all there (it’s all there) (yah)
Chopper on me all snares
Big ol' crib with 300 chairs
1500 stares
Super slimey like a cobra
All we know, stick to the code, yea (Ayy)
Ice all on my neck i’m snowed in (Yah)
I’m the one and yeah they know it (Ayy)
