Lyrics from Snippet

[Intro]
Slatt, hey, alright
Bugz on the beat
And you know, um
I was just talking to, um, I'm sayin I'm sayin
I was talkin' to Thug, he said

[Chorus]
"Uzi, I am proud of you"
I said "Slime, I'm proud of you"
He said "That's a Rollie, kid"
I said "This a new Rollie, kid"
I am a Smithstoneyan
Look how big this Rollie is
"Uzi, I am proud of you"
I said "Slime, I'm proud of you"
"Uzi, I am proud of you"
I said "slime, I'm proud of you"
He said "That's a Rollie, kid"
I said "This a new Rollie, kid"
I am a Smithstoneyan
Look how big this Rollie is
"Uzi, I am proud of you"

[Verse]
Rockstar, yeah, my bitch like Korn
Went to MIA to the orange
Pull up in a new Lamb, no insurance
That be foreign
Overseas money when a nigga tourin'
She suck it up and the eyes start pourin'
Don't be struggling just like George, woah
Let's go
It's no way that I'm fighting you
She move like a prostitute
She ain't got a lot to lose
No, no, at all
That's my Rollie, face is green
Slimey Rollie face is red
Gunna Rollie face is blue
Oh, fo' sho, fo' sho
I could never make that girl my hoe, 'cause she play wit' her nose
Diamonds on my wrists, my hands, my neck, my nose
I ran out of space, put it on my ankles, put it on my toes
Oh yeah, put it on your bitch, put it on my bros

[Chorus]
"Uzi, I am proud of you"
I said "Slime, I'm proud of you"
He said "That's a Rollie, kid"
I said "This a new Rollie, kid"
I am a Smithstoneyan
Look how big this Rollie is
"Uzi, I am proud of you"
I said "Slime, I'm proud of you"
"Uzi, I am proud of you"
I said "Slime, I'm proud of you"
He said "That's a Rollie, kid"
I said "This a new Rollie, kid"
I am a Smithstoneyan
Look how big this Rollie is
"Uzi, I am proud of you"
