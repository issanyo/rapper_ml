Lyrics from Snippet

[Chorus]
We got all the fun, drop it this way
We got all the ones, shake it this way (What?)
Bitch, diamonds on my arm
Yeah, my wrist shine
You know that I get the guap, so she gonna come this way (Ayy)
We got all the fun, drop it this way (Yeah)
We got all the ones, shake it this way (What?)
We got all the guns, don't come this way
