[Verse 1]
Drop
My younger niggas chasin' money
OG's just ain't get hungry
On the block lurkin', 2 o clock servin'
Run up on a nigga with that .40 like which one you workin'
Only fuck with bosses and
I know shorties cause them niggas runners
Drop
With my hat to back and my eyes all red
In a black cadillac, masarti
With a bad bitch beside me
When I go through
All the medicine in the cut when I go through
Don't really give a fuck when I go through

We come around we probably smoke a hundred pounds
I'm posted in the vip, I'm with your bitch its going down
When the kid got dropped hit em with the molly whop
And his shit start leakin' and the shit don't stop, ]?] got shot
And his bitch got taken
When you see a nigga gettin' low
On the block duckin' from the 5-0
Get some swishers then go back to the store
Stripper bitches I'mma maker her drop it low
When I turn up
All this money gon' drop when I throw it up in the air
When I turn up
All this money gon' drop when I throw it up in the air
When I turn up
All this money gon' drop when I throw it up in the air

[Verse 2: a$ap ant]

[Hook]
When you see a nigga gettin' low
On the block duckin' from the 5-0
Get some swishers then go back to the store
Stripper bitches I'mma maker her drop it low
When I turn up
All this money gon' drop when I throw it up in the air
When I turn up
All this money gon' drop when I throw it up in the air
When I turn up
All this money gon' drop when I throw it up in the air

[Verse 3: Lil Uzi Vert]
Drop, that bitch off
She ain't givin' up the coochie
Drop, Both our nigga if he really actin' stupid
Drop that lean in my cup, bitch fuckin' with a doobie
Why you ain't leave her, cause you smokin' on a loosie
Drop, 1200 on these margielas cause they raf
Drop, that blonde shit
I'm super Saiyan with my hair
Drop everything got your bitch over here
And I dropped 1200 on a balmain

[Hook]
When you see a nigga gettin' low
On the block duckin' from the 5-0
Get some swishers then go back to the store
Stripper bitches I'mma maker her drop it low
When I turn up
All this money gon' drop when I throw it up in the air
When I turn up
All this money gon' drop when I throw it up in the air
When I turn up
All this money gon' drop when I throw it up in the air
