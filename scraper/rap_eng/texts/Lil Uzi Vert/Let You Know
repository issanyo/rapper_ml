[Chorus x2]
Let you know, I'ma let you know
You can't keep up close, diamonds they so froze
Water like a boat
Spanish girl named Rosa, and she from the coast
She know I'm a soldier, girl, I'll let you know
I'ma let you know
Diamonds they so froze, water like a boat
Spanish girl named Rosa, and she from the coast
Prolly on your poster
Get that guap just like I'm posin'
Get that thot just like I

[Verse 1]
80k a show, 100k a show
Why my neck so frozen? Why my Rollie golden?
Walking with my .40, and my money showing
Walking with that [?] my money ain't foldin
Boy I am not slow, you hate on the low
You was still at home, I was on the road
Know that I'm a dog, I'm bad to the bone
Dior my cologne, smoking gas it's strong
Leave me alone, stop calling my phone
Already know what you're thinking lil baby, girl, oh I know
She said "Uzi baby, they ain't got no choice"
Why you're so cold? You already know

[Chorus]
Let you know, I'ma let you know
You can't keep up close, diamonds they so froze
Water like a boat
Spanish girl named Rosa, and she from the coast
She know I'm a soldier, girl, I'll let you know
I'ma let you know
Diamonds they so froze, water like a boat
Spanish girl named Rosa, and she from the coast
Prolly on your poster
Get that guap just like I'm posin'
Get that thot just like I

[Verse 2]
Girl you took a L and we can see that
Stevie Wonder, Ray Charles, yeah, don't you see that?
[?] just like Andre [?] 3stacks
I get money, fuck your bitch, stay real
Ooh, that's three facts
Diamonds on my fist, my wrist, my grill
Ooh, I mean that
Made your girl swallow my dick like a pill
Ooh, don't relapse
She keeps stalking on my phone, think this thing's tapped
Diamonds all up in my pinky, think this thing's tapped
I do not fuck with these niggas, man I mean that
Woah, money envelope
I was just so broke
I didn't have hope
Now I'll

[Chorus]
Let you know, I'ma let you know
You can't keep up close, diamonds they so froze
Water like a boat
Spanish girl named Rosa, and she from the coast
She know I'm a soldier, girl, I'll let you know
I'ma let you know
Diamonds they so froze, water like a boat
Spanish girl named Rosa, and she from the coast
Prolly on your poster
Get that guap just like I'm posin'
Get that thot just like I
