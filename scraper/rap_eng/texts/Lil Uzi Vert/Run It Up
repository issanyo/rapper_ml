Fuck it up fuck it up

[Hook]
I had to fuck that bitch one more time
I had to hit the blunt one more time
I had to roll it up one more time
Roll it up, roll it up
I had to fuck that bitch one more time
I had to hit the blunt one more time
I had to roll it up one more time
Roll it up, roll it up
I had to fuck that bitch one more time
I had to hit the blunt one more time
I had to roll it up one more time
Roll it up, roll it up
I had to fuck that bitch one more time
I had to hit the blunt one more time
I had to roll it up one more time
Run it up run it up
Roll it up roll it up
Pour it up pour it up
If you got a check fuck it up
Roll it up roll it up
Count it up count it up

[Verse 1: KUR]
I just got my homie out, I just told him roll me up
We were smoking way too much
Bitches doing way too much
I been doing what I want, I'm just young and having fun
Never give my love to hoes
All these  bitches made me numb
All these bitches made me numb
All these lil bitches made me numb
Every other day its fuck my ex
Every single day I'm smoking weed
Every single day I think of Reem

[Hook]
I had to fuck that bitch one more time
I had to hit the blunt one more time
I had to roll it up one more time
Roll it up, roll it up
I had to fuck that bitch one more time
I had to hit the blunt one more time
I had to roll it up one more time
Roll it up, roll it up
I had to fuck that bitch one more time
I had to hit the blunt one more time
I had to roll it up one more time
Roll it up, roll it up
I had to fuck that bitch one more time
I had to hit the blunt one more time
I had to roll it up one more time
Run it up run it up
Roll it up roll it up
Pour it up pour it up
If you got a check fuck it up
Roll it up roll it up
Count it up count it up


[Verse 2: Lil Uzi Vert]
Um, count it up count it up aye
All this money pockets stuffed aye
Gettin' money countin' big face, so I can't get enough
Bad bitch with a slim waist, ask that girl what you want
Swerve in the foreign I'm driftin'
Jump in the game like I'm Pippen
All I do is fuck these hoes now
Remember couldn't get the bitches
I must be high off the gas (I must be high)
One thing always got the bitches
I feel like I'm Percy Miller
Cause my money got no limit
Riding around in my, woah, my car ain't got no ceiling
Gettin' my money, countin' my comma, uh yeah dab
Word on the street I'm hot like a sauna
Kur that's my homie, thats more like my brodie
Ball like Tony Parker and Ginobli
Most of these niggas out here they be phony
Me & my niggas smoke gas and we zonin'
