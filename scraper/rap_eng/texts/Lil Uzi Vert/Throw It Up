Spend all my money and it still stack up
Fucking on the thottie, got my list back up
40 with the stick make my hip stand up
She keep asking can she kiss my blunt
Put five different minerals in my cup
Stir 'em in the cup 'cause I'm feeling numb
Pull up with a choppa and it got a drum
Throw it up nigga, now where you from?
Throw it up nigga, now where you from?
