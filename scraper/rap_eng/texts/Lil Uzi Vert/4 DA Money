[Verse 1: Lil Uzi Vert]
Your bitch all up on my dick
Yeah she be my fan the most
Hear me on the ready yeah
Hit that bitch like Sammy Sos
My niggas they blam most
Heard that you get jammed the most
Whip that shit you never saw
Them drugs ye they be tan the most
Work her out like cardio, with my brothers Mario
Only give her twenty minutes, my dick give her cameo
When I send my bitch the coke I mean that she really should snort
That bitch will give into me when I met papi for the dope
Mansion with a 50 roll, aim that bitch right at your throat
My spot smoke extended dope, you struggling for the rolls
She said that the price so good that bricks, came for a second price, For me that bitch do the most, she keep banging lil misses saying I'm the antidote
Lil Uzi a animal, old money your family go
Can't find you I blam your ho

[Verse 2: YSL]
Wine cellar in the mo, quit then let the caden blow
Come up with the sickest flow, I pull up with the baddest hoe
Breaking down the hater door

Aim it at yo melon watch it split just like a cantelope
Real nigga extended flow
Chasing bread, I need a low
My bitch so bad, yeah she so bad she need a benz I need a ghost
Throwing racks, paying rent
And we gettin hella bent
Shawty got a booty and she thicker than an elephant
Freak Bulluer smell of scent
VVS diamonds, changing climate shawty freaky want a threesome so she tell her friends
Team I just set a trend

Ridin with a uzi me and uzi bitch on life in here
Where ever that moola go
