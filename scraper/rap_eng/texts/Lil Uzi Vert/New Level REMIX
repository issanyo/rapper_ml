Broke, poor, they eliminate us
Throw my people down the incinerator

[Verse 3: A$AP Rocky]
On another, 'nother level now
That's shrooms, acid, drank, weed, pills
Fresh manicure, breaking down the bag
Didn't even stain my clean nails
I bet there's some killers who die for me
Catch a body on they free will
My West Coast niggas ride for me
Word to the homie G Will
Dollar sign, dollar sign, dollar sign
My crew look like an exhibition now
Mama only riding Benzes now
Traded in the Expedition now
My bitches only flying business now
My pretty face up in the Guinness now
I model Dior like I'm Christian now
Got her masturbating to my pictures now
Two front gold teeth
All I want for Christmas is peace between brothers and police
24 karat gold leash on my exotic pet
Exotic car, no lease
And I designed it, back to you flooded with diamonds
Bitches they call me Your Highness
Sipping on medicine, when no coughing, no sinus
That alarm all the sirens

[Hook: A$AP Ferg & Future]
I'm on a new level (I'm on it, I'm on it)
