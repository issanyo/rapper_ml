(Intro: Thouxanbanfauni)
Damn DJ Plugg, DJ Pl-
Dee and Dee Money want billions
Oh, GT I like this one
I keep that shit in my jeans

[Hook: Thouxanbanfauni]
.30 round all in my jeans
I spilt the Wock on my jeans
I got that lean on my jeans
I spilt the Tech on my jeans
I keep a strap in my jeans
I keep a Tech in my jeans
Got me a dick in my jeans
Got me two dicks in my jeans
Yo hoe she all in my jeans
I keep that shit in my jeans
I spilt the lean on my jeans
I got that Wock in my jeans

(Verse 1: Lil Uzi Vert)
Hold up, my new girl, yeah, that's your folder
Got the chopper with no holster
That shit might knock out my shoulder
I stuck the fan in the cooler
Drivin' the Lamb' at the Lotus
Flacko done told me to slow up
Spin around and hit the donuts
I had your girl I wan' hold her
I fuck and she deep throating
She suck my dick like the stick, yeah
I told that girl I'm reloaded
30 rounds all in my clip, yeah
And my bullets hit like boulders
Money so big I can't fold her
Can't fit in my pockets so I have elope
Double cup, ice with the potion
Diamonds they hit like the ocean
Can't read my shirt cause it's Gosha
Scope got the aim with the Ruger
Swerving the Range it's the Rover
I hit the shot with the Floater
I flood the AP like Rollie
I got the bread in the toaster
I got the bread in the toaster

[Hook: Thouxanbanfauni]
.30 round all in my jeans
I spilt the Wock on my jeans
I got that lean on my jeans
I spilt the Tech on my jeans
I keep a strap in my jeans
I keep a Tech in my jeans
Got me a dick in my jeans
Got me two dicks in my jeans
Yo hoe she all in my jeans
I keep that shit in my jeans
I spilt the lean on my jeans
I got that Wock in my jeans

(Verse 2: Lil Uzi Vert)
Don't want no sex lil' bitch
Just wan' the neck lil' bitch
You tryna act like you like me, huh
You want a check bitch, huh
You want a check you bitch
Can't get the check you bitch, yeah
Pull out a 100K give my girl 99, look, yeah
I bless my chick
You got your first piece of Raf
You tryna flex and shit
I got so much money, boy, they be watchin' and I had to rest my drip, yeah
I had to rest my drip, yeah
I had to rest my drip, yeah
I do not go to the club, my crib where my section is
Told her "Don't call my phone, not with the texting, bitch
Don't want no messages, feelings ain't catching it"
Told her "You talk to much, baby girl rest your lips"
Baby go rest your lips, yeah

(Outro: Lil Uzi Vert)
Woah, woah, woah, woah, woah
Woah, woah, woah, woah, woah
Woah, woah, woah, woah, woah, woah
