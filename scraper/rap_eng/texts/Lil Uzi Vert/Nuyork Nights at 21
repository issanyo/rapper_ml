[Verse 1]
And I know I made mistakes

What about the times you looked at me like you loved me, gave me the face
It was times putting nothing above you not even the cake

Thought of something important baby, it is nothing now
It is nothing now, I said it is nothing now
And I thought they just was hating
No they wasn't hating
I was just on wait and you was contemplating
We was in the same book but we different pages
We was in the same book but we different pages
Better yet we like the same, she my other half

Never took it serious, we slept in on bape clothes
We treat them like play clothes, all these bitches snake hoes
