[Verse 1]
Ballin' till I fall, wipe that air off
You ain't know I could put words together, tryna spare y'all
We ain't scared, young niggas in area
My cousin he ready and he cannot wipe a tear off
If you ain't wit' it then why you here though
Shakin' like you scared though
All that courage stuff so cowardly just like a scared dog
Fuck you gon' swing, or we just gon' have a stare off
My new girl allergic to fur leather in the winter

[Hook]
My new girl allergic to fur cat ain't got no hair though
And that's, something that I had to share though
But I know you do not care though
And my Raf is an oldie so I'm living super rare though
My V-Lone from 2013 this shit might tear though
They say, Uzi why you turn down
This that let me sit the chair though

[Verse 2]
