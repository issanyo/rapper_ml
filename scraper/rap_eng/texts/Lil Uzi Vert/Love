[Pre-Chorus: Lil Uzi Vert]
How does it feel?
I don't want your love, yeah
Now you want my love, yeah
I don't need your love now, oh
Yeah, I don't want your love
Yeah, I don't need your love
Yeah, I don't want your love
Now oh, now oh, yeah
Now oh, now oh

[Chorus: Lil Uzi Vert]
I don't need your love, love, love
I don't need your love, love, love
I don't need your love, love, love
I don't need your love, love
I don't need your, I don't need your
I don't need your love, love

[Verse: Lil Uzi Vert]
I am no fool
You can not treat me like you treat them other guys
I don't want you and you wonder why
When around me you get butterflies
She looked at me like when I'm not your type
She really love me I know
She really love me I know
Coming to all of my shows
Walking around with the dough
Changing my pitch and my flow
Changing my pitch and my flow

[Chorus: Lil Uzi Vert]
I don't need your love, love, love
I don't need your love, love, love
I don't need your love, love, love
I don't need your love, love
I don't need your, I don't need your
I don't need your love, love, love
I don't need your love, love, love
I don't need your love, love, love
I don't need your love, love
I don't need your, I don't need your
I don't need your love, love
