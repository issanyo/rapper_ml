Lyrics from Snippet

[Hook]
Now I'm gettin money, I remember I just was starving
Walking in this water like the sea, watch how I part it
I got something for you
Please don't run up on me
Now my pockets rockin'
I feel like I'm Harden
I'm so used to ballin'
You need to award this
Your lil bitch keep callin'
Lil Uzi keep stallin'
That lil bitch so garbage
That is not a target

[Verse 1]
New Balenciagas, then I do my step
Brush them haters off, then I gotta flex
All my diamonds set just like [?]
Talkin' outside of your neck, if it ain't bout the check
And if you ain't giving no neck, then I gotta hit next
You ain't bro, never hear my voice I talk through text
Think you know everything talk too much, bitch you talk less
Diamonds in my Carti you know I'll smack your man (ohh)
Pull up in my whip, I'm not a walkin' man
Yeah, them bitches they played him
Tell him that I'm coming but I leave all 'em hoes waitin'
On her knees, that her knees, treat her like I'm Jason

[Hook]
Damn, no key just to start it
Now I'm gettin' money, I remember I just was starving
Walking in this water like the sea, watch how I part it
I got something for you
Please don't run up on me (hey)
Now my pockets rockin'
I feel like I'm Harden
I'm so used to ballin'
You need to award this
Your lil bitch keep callin'
Lil Uzi keep stallin'
That lil bitch so garbage
That is not a target

[Verse 2]
17, 5 whip it too much
Bitch I got high right off 2 cups (damn)
Put a .30 shot in my Ruger
No, I do not need a shooter
Nowadays I am my own shooter
Aye, look at that, woah, yeah, wrist froze (huh)
Bad bitch, ass
