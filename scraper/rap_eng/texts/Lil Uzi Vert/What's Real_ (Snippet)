[Lyrics from Snippet]

Boy, stole my style, that mean he my child, wait
Like my bitch so hot, no mild
That bitch crack till a nigga pipe down
Ooh, boy your pockets frail
You better weigh your scale
Head first, they take it for real
But boy the hate is real, yah
Half of my diamonds white, half of my diamonds teal
Half of yo diamonds fake, half of yo diamonds real
Ion know what to say, ion know how to feel
Imma keep gettin cake
