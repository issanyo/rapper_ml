Lyrics from Snippet

[Hook: Lil Uzi vert]
Tell me what you mean
Tell me what you mean
I can't understand I was too focused on the cream
Shawty you a dub and I'm too focused on the beans
I remember when she used to play me in my teens
That was way back then when she ain't lookin' for my team
I'm so out of luck you better cuff me in your dreams
I'm too focused on the money bustin' out my jeans
