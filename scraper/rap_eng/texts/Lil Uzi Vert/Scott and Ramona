Yaaahhh, yahhh, yah
Yah, yah, yah

[Verse 1]
Baby you are not alone
You call my phone I pick it up
She pick it up then drop it slow
Keep it on the low
From what I hear she got a man at home
I go deep but I'm tired of waitin'
Got a situation
Live my double life amazin'

[Hook]
I can't go a day if I don't talk to my baby
I went to my hood all my friends think I made it
I talk to my fam, man my momma think I'm famous
Yeah my momma think I'm famous

[Bridge]
100 dollar bills in the way
Yeah it feels good to be great
Yeah now she gotta do what I say
Yeah now she gotta do what I say
I count my dough, I make it stack
I spent on her, I make it back
What you told me, can't take that back
What I told you, can't take that back

[Hook]
I can't go a day if I don't talk to my baby
I went to my hood all my friends think I made it
I talk to my fam man my momma think I'm famous
Yeah my momma think I'm famous

[Verse 2]
Rule number one, gotta get all your paper
I'm in a zone, I can't see none of you haters
When I'm not around I don't know what she sayin'
Say she single but she know she really taken
I don't care at all
Rule number one, never trust no hoe
Ride around in LA in a Range Rover
Radio blasting, listening to Dej Loaf

[Bridge]
100 dollar bills in the way
Yeah it feels good to be great
Yeah now she gotta do what I say
Yeah now she gotta do what I say
I count my dough, I make it stack
I spent on her, I make it back
What you told me, can't take that back
What I told you, can't take that back

[Outro]
I don't care at all
I don't care at all
Rule number one, never trust no ho
Ride around in LA in a Range Rove
Radio blastin', listenin' to Dej Loaf
