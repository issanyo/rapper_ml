[Intro]
I've always wanted to fuck an insomniac

[Chorus: Lil Uzi Vert]
The Rollie, the diamond, the bezel
This life I've unsettled
And yeah, I came straight from the ghetto
Punk rock, heavy metal
The Backwood, the paper, the 'rillo
Get you on a level
I swear, I be poppin' like kettle
I'm frontin' these devils
The Rollie, the diamond, the bezel
This life I've unsettled
And yeah, I came straight from the ghetto
Punk rock, heavy metal
The Backwood, the paper, the 'rillo
Get you on a level
I swear, I be poppin' like kettle
I'm frontin' these devils

[Verse: LAMB$]
Pullin' up wit' them chains on, better have your torch (Have your torch)
Ayy, them lil' niggas be lackin', we gon' pull they card
Lately I'm fightin' these demons, pour me a four in the mornin' (Ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy)
Pop me a Perc' and a Xanny just so I can get started (I need a Perc')
.223s they aim for heads, not no body parts (No)
In the kitchen, pressin', work until that shit get hard (Yeah, yeah)
Use that lil' bitch for her address, send a box there (Box there)
I'm in traffic with my stick in case you take it there (With my stick there)
Really got the chopper, so I rap about it (Ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy)
Really got them sticks, so I rap about it (Ayy, ayy, ayy)
Really got the racks, so I rap about it (Yeah, yeah)
Yeah, bitch, yeah, I rap about it

[Chorus: Lil Uzi Vert]
The Rollie, the diamond, the bezel
This life I've unsettled
And yeah, I came straight from the ghetto
Punk rock, heavy metal
The Backwood, the paper, the 'rillo
Get you on a level
I swear, I be poppin' like kettle
I'm frontin' these devils
The Rollie, the diamond, the bezel
This life I've unsettled
And yeah, I came straight from the ghetto
Punk rock, heavy metal
The Backwood, the paper, the 'rillo
Get you on a level
I swear, I be poppin' like kettle
I'm frontin' these devils
