Lyrics from Snippet

[Pre-Hook: Lil Uzi Vert]
No, I will not answer
Please, do not, don't call my phone
Mr. Do Not Answer Phone
Please, don't, girl, no, leave me 'lone
Double cup, it's styrofoam
Pull up my car, it go vroom
This a coupe, no, no, leg room
Pull up on your bitch like zoom

[Hook: Lil Uzi Vert]
What you thought, that I wasn't gon' come through?
What you thought, I wasn't gon' get comfortable?
You know, I wouldn't do this, if it wasnâ€™t you
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I know, what I can and what I can't do
I know every time, that I'mma come through

[Verse 1: Lil Uzi Vert]
Yeah, I just turned to the big man
Big shoes, big hands, counting big bands
Big B on the back of my new van
She saw the zippers and said, "Those are some sick pants"
Ooh

[Pre-Hook: Lil Uzi Vert]
No, I will not answer
Please, do not call my phone
Mr. Do Not Answer Phone
Please, don't call, no, leave me 'lone
Double cup, the styrofoam
Pull up my car, it go vroom
This a coupe, no, no, leg room
Pull up on your bitch like zoom

[Hook: Lil Uzi Vert]
What you thought, that I wasn't gon' come through?
What you thought I wasn't gon' get comfortable?
You know, I wouldn't do this, if it wasn't you
Yeah, yeah, yeah
I know, what I can and what I can't do
I know every time, that I'mma come through
