[Intro]
I'm from the beast of the Belly
I'm from the beast of the Belly

[Hook]
I'm from the beast of the Belly
Got all this bread like a deli
Really ain't shit you can tell me
Bitch be like Tommy off “Belly”
My main bitch, her name is Keisha
My side bitch, her name is Kionna
Hanging with killers and robbers
Pull out my dick and she swallow

[Post-Hook]
My main bitch, her name is Keisha
My side bitch, her name Kianna
My main bitch, her name is Keisha
My side bitch, her name Kianna
My main bitch, her name is Keisha
My side bitch, her name Kianna
Pull out my dick and she swallow
Hanging with the killers and robbers

[Verse 1]
I fuck your bitch with no condom
Now you take care of my family
Mixing the lean with yo' drama
That shit tastes like Cotton Candy
Kiesha put dick in her belly
Kianna never wear no panties
I beat it, I feel like I'm Danny
I'm skirting out in the White Rovers
You driving Toyota Corollas
The Bentley, it's system, no solar
My bitch's skin look like it's mocha
I pull out my dick and I poke her
My gun, I swear, ain't got no holster
I hit yo' ass right with the toaster
We bout it, bout it like Magnolia
If you walk fast, my gun will slow ya'
I tear a hole in you like donuts
I'm whippin' that white like the Jonas'
I'm fuckin' yo' bitch for the bonus
Please show me, um, my opponent
I'm likin' the way that I'm flowin'
You look at my chain, now it's snowin'
Snakes all in the grass, get to mowin'
Extendo on gun and then I get to blowin'

[Hook]
I'm from the beast of the Belly
Got all this bread like a deli
Really ain't shit you can tell me
My bitch like Tommy off “Belly”
My main bitch, her name is Keisha
My side bitch, her name is Kianna
Hanging with killers and robbers
Pull out my dick and she swallow

[Post-Hook]
My main bitch, her name is Keisha
My side bitch, her name Kianna
My main bitch, her name is Keisha
My side bitch, her name Kianna
My main bitch, her name is Keisha
My side bitch, her name Kianna
Pull out my dick and she swallow
Hang with killers and robbers

[Verse 2]
Aye
Chain colder, cold-hearted, aye
Diamond flawless, I'm important, aye
I rock Visvim, this ain't Jordan, babe
Hundreds all on them hoes, aye
Spending money with my bros, aye
Throwing shots at my foes, aye
Drinking lean, this ain't rosé!
Bandanna tied, feel like I'm 2Pac, aye
I'm grilled up like an ox, aye [?]
Me and my bitch in the house, aye
She tried to argue me out, aye
What is this I'm all about
She said "Who the fuck is Kianna?", aye
I said "It's only you, Keisha", aye
Then it's my dick what I feed her
Keisha my main
Got Kianna on the side, Like Chicken Caesar
I swerve in the Range
All my whips, I got work and I use an egg beater
Dress up like I'm homeless
I'm gon' walk up to your whip and watch you lose your brain
Been in this game
I might go to Africa, money insane!

[Hook]
I'm from the beast of the Belly
Got all this bread like a deli
Really ain't shit you can tell me
My bitch be like Tommy on “Belly”
My main bitch, her name is Keisha
My side bitch, her name is Kianna
Hanging with killers and robbers
Pull out my dick and she swallow

[Post-Hook]
My main bitch, her name is Keisha
My side bitch, her name Kianna
My main bitch, her name is Keisha
My side bitch, her name Kianna
My main bitch, her name is Keisha
My side bitch, her name Kianna
Pull out my dick and she swallow
Hang with the killers and robbers
