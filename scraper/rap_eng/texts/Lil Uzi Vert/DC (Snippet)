[Lyrics from Snippet]

[Hook]
Yeah, they said I wouldn't make it
Said I couldn't do it
Can't believe I made it
Can't believe I made it
Like, can't believe they hated
When they are all up in my face, yeah
I ain't gotta time, I'ma break the bank
Countin' all my bandz
Yeah, I'm the man
Glasses lit up tint, this is no Ray-Ban
Owe you 36, I super soak your ma'am
Money in my hand, ridin' in the Lamb

[Verse 1]
Aye, yeah
Aye, yeah
Knew I wanted it when I was like 17
Turning it right to my reality, yeah

Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Hook]
Yeah, they said I wouldn't make it
Said I couldn't do it
Can't believe I made it
Can't believe I made it
Like, can't believe they hated
When they are all up in my face, yeah
I ain't gotta time, I'ma break the bank
Countin' all my bandz
Yeah, I'm the man
Glasses lit up tint, this is no Ray-Ban
Owe you 36, I super soak your ma'am
Money in my hand, ridin' in the Lamb
