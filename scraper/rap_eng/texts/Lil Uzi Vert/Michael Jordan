[Intro]
Ka-ka-ka
Huh, yeah
Can't rap, Lil Uzi, think I suck
I sing in the trap

[Hook]
I'm Jordan (Michael Jordan)
I'm Jordan (Michael Jordan)
I'm Jordan (Michael Jordan)
Michael Jordan (what I can't do?)
I'm Jordan

I'm Jordan (Michael Jordan)
Michael Jordan (I'm the GOAT)

[Verse]
Yeah I'm gettin' money
Yeah I'm gettin' money fuck nigga how could you tell
I'm gettin' my drugs in the mail
I make it rain, grab a pail
I got more bills than the mail
Opposite of a female
On the table got three pills
Baow-baow-baow, I'm the three shells
My bread is older, it's stale
Nigga hate on me, oh well
Leave they ass salty like snails
Vegan bitch only eat kale
The carnivore in the tale
I'm runnin' the game and you should deffo do the same
I am ahead of the trail
Yes I do fuck with Young Thugger
I smell good, this YSL
Slatt, slatt, slatt like YSL
Blat-blat-blat like YSL
I got bars not seen in jail
Xanny bars keep me so still
Whats crackin' to my cousin Sia?
My nigga leggin' K styles they oh so for real
I'm not set trippin' I just keep it trill
I'ma keep countin' this money till I count up to a mil
Eatin' pussy, that's the meal
You play with yourself until your arm strong just like Neil
I'm the greatest

[Hook]
I'm Jordan
I'm Jordan (Michael fuckin' Jordan)
I'm Jordan
Michael Jordan (what I can't do?)
I'm Jordan
I'm Jordan (Michael Jordan)
I'm Jordan
Michael Jordan (I'm the GOAT)
