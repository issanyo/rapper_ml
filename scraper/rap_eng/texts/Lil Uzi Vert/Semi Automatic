[Hook: Lil Uzi Vert & Ethan Sacii]
The Rollie the diamond the bezel
It's like I've been settled
And yeah I came straight from the ghetto
Punk rock heavy metal
The backwood the paper the rillo
Get you on that level
I swear I be poppin' like kettle
I'm frontin' these devils
Really got the semi so I rap about it, aye
Really got the choppers so I rap about it, aye
Really spending racks so I rap about it, aye aye
So I rap about it

[Verse: Ethan Sacii]
Diamonds shining hard just like lighting
I be sipping purple like the Vikings
Knock a nigga out like Mike Tyson
Had to switch my Rollie to the Breitling
Got bezels on bezels
She rocking Margielas
I fight with the devil
Jewelry so cold like metal
My bitches bad and they seven
Eating these Xans just like Edibles
I'm fronting these devils
Stacking my crackers like animals
Eating your bitch just like Hannibal

[Hook: Lil Uzi Vert & Ethan Sacii]
The Rollie the diamond the bezel
It's like I've been settled
And yeah I came straight from the ghetto
Punk rock heavy metal middle
The backwood the paper the rillo
Get you on that level
I swear I be poppin' like kettle
I'm frontin' these devils
Really got the semi so I rap about it, aye
Really got the choppers so I rap about it, aye
Really spending racks so I rap about it, aye aye
So I rap about it
