[Intro: Lil Uzi Vert & Kodie Shane]
Thought you was my baby, but you left me alone, no no (no, no)
Baby had to drop my top cause I feel alone, no no (no, no)
Baby where my baby cause you left me alone, oh no (ok)
Baby show me top cause I'm feeling alone, oh no
I'm so gone

[Verse 1: Lil Uzi Vert & Kodie Shane]
I'm too tired
I'm sick of doing of what I'm doing
Mind racing, time wasting, I'm bout to lose it
I'm giving up, giving up, don't let me lose it
You're giving up, giving up, won't let you do it
I'm giving up, giving up, no I won't do it
Not giving up, giving up, no I won't lose it
I must admit that I was wrong
Should've never ever ever left you lone
My number ain't change girl call my phone
Don't say that shit, that's the same song
Hope yaâ€™ll are looking at the same, no
Inside the coupe white like mayo
Might drop my top just to let the brain go

[Hook: Lil Uzi Vert & Kodie Shane]
Thought you was my baby cause you left me lone, no no (no, no)
Baby can we talk when I'm feeling alone, no no  (no, no)
Baby where my baby cause you left me alone, oh no (ok)
Baby show me top when I'm feeling alone, no no
I'm so gone

[Verse 2: Lil Uzi Vert & Kodie Shane]
I was patient
You were faking
I was waiting
Stuck around then the money came in
I know you hate it
Your niggas hate it
It's hard to say it
It's been amazing but I don't want no conversation
Pull up in a spaceship not a Maserati baby
These are not in store, no you cannot find this baby
Diamonds shining baby no you cannot have this baby
Please don't want this baby (uh)
Just some rockstars baby (yeah)
Diamonds shining and I know that you can't have that baby (no)
I won't wonder baby (yeah)
You just a rockstar baby (yeah)
I do what I want
All these rules ain't fun
I might take you from him
He ain't gonna do nothing (yeah)

[Hook: Lil Uzi Vert & Kodie Shane]
Thought you was my baby cause you left me lone, no no (no, no)
Baby can we talk  when I'm feeling alone, no no  (no, no)
Baby where my baby cause you left me alone, oh no (ok)
Baby show me top when I'm feeling alone, no no
I'm so gone
