[Chorus]
I can't really give you no advice
But don't follow that white lie
Yeah, don't follow that white lie
Yeah, don't follow that white lie
Yeah, don't follow that white lie
Yeah, don't follow that white lie
Yeah, I can't really give you no advice
But don't follow that white lie

[Verse]
'Member high school, I liked Ashley
But I really was in love with Tara Jean
Nowadays, I'm in love with Brittany, ay
She's a rock-star, ay
So she understands ay
She say I'm her man
My chemical romance, my
My chemical romance, my
My chemical romance, my
My chemical romance, my
Yeah, stick it right inside
Hit it from the side
Doors on suicide
Call her cellular
Nothin' regular
Gettin' what she wants
Not a settler

[Chorus]
I can't really give you no advice
But don't follow that white lie
Yeah, don't follow that white lie
Yeah, don't follow that white lie
Yeah, don't follow that white lie
Yeah, don't follow that white lie
Yeah, I can't really give you no advice
But don't follow that white lie
