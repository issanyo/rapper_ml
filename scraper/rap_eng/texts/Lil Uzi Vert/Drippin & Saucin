Scary, scary, scary

All I know is he the snitch nigga of them all

This bitch all on me because I got the sauce
Sippin' that purple like I'm Randy Moss

Drippin' and saucin' on you and you
Kickin' and splashin' with Uzi-Uz
Try to tuck mine, I'ma shoot
Don't want no problems, I just want some loot
I'm talkin' 'bout guap
Sosamann I'm a rockstar, on gas playin' guitars
Ridin' round in a foriegn car
Countin' cash and I'm kickin' flavor
I remember when these niggas hated
Now these niggas so outdated
How we came up, outrageous
Quick as hell, 93 the smell
Free my niggas out the fuckin' cells
Give it to me it's gon' fuckin' sale, on sauce!

Kickin' this flavor, kung-fu
Bitch I'm a dog, I'm piru
Bitch I'm a dog, Scooby-doo
My diamonds white like a jew
Double cup full like a pool
I should be dead, or locked up in jail
I used to take burners to school
Shot pistols and been on the news
Now I'm on MTV
I don't have sex with none of my groupies unless the ho pay me
Baby gotta pay the fee
Baby gotta pay the fee
Baby gotta kick a branch and make some leaves fall out the fuckin' tree
Pay me or pay me no attention, girl I'm Sauce Gotti, I forgot to mention
Shooter with me holdin' that extension
Girl ya man a ganster, I'll make him a Christian
Shots fired, lord Jesus
Fuck niggas, no features
All my niggas creatures
Drippin' sauce out my lean cup
