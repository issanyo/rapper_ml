[Intro]
ATL Jacob
Pyrex, turn me up
Let's go

[Chrous: Lil Gotit]
Been rocking double G's, feel like a girly girl (on God)
Feel like I'm Hercules, in a boy's world (boy's world)
Lil' mama multi-fee (what), on the views trust
And yeah, you earned your keys (uh)
That car got a lot of horse (skrr)
For F stand tall (say what?), 'cause you my all (my all)
Yeah shell, son (shell), and you made a blessin'
Took me through lessons (on God), protect the foe from me
'Cause you know I run these streets ('naut)
Yeah I gotta get this bread, yeah, that whole wheat (lil baby)

[Verse 1: Lil Gotit]
I'm on low-key, I live my best life (that life)
Feel like it chose me
All the doors start opening
In a dark room, walls closing (start closing)
I'm getting big enough (big)
My pockets fully stuffed (on God)
I ain't a local joker (no)
Go giving your life to Poker (giving your life)
Apartments we was laying, no sofas
So why I'mma act like I don't know ya
Always act slime
Jay Die, be slime my kind
But I know shawty ring
Rocking 23 carats

[Chorus: Lil Gotit]
Been rocking double G's, feel like a girly girl (on God)
Feel like I'm Hercules, in a boy's world (boy's world)
Lil' mama multi-fee (what), on the views trust
And yeah, you earned your keys (uh)
That car got a lot of horse (skrr)
For F stand tall (say what?), 'cause you my all (my all)
Yeah shell, son (shell), and you made a blessin'
Took me through lessons (on God), protect the foe from me
'Cause you know I run these streets ('naut)
Yeah I gotta get this bread, yeah, that whole wheat

[Verse 2: Lil Uzi Vert]
