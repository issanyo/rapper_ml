[Intro: 03 Greedo]
Yeah
You lil bitch ass niggas steady speaking up on the low
If these project walls could talk
They'll be just like 03, you dig?
03

[Chorus: 03 Greedo]
If these walls could spit bars, all of they songs be this hard
In this game play your cards right or get left to starve
My mama made me a star, I just had it too hard
Bitch I came from the tar but I got high again
I'm thanking God, could have died in the pen
You haven't been 'gainst the odds like I been
You haven't been where I been, I never fold, never bend

[Verse 1: Lil Uzi Vert]
I couldn't stop the xan before I had money
I been dressin' like this way before they fuckin' loved me
Feel it in my stomach, molly might just make me vomit
Takin' acid with the shrooms, I'm tryna see my conscience
Too much hype in my life
You not with the gang so I'm not tryna hear no tides
I'm not tryna hear no sides
I can't believe you out here in these streets livin' lies
You really think that you tough
Callin' his bluff but we really be loadin' them nines
They DM'ed me at 8:05
Put it on me, had that boy gone like 8:59 (on me)
You can feel it in your spine
Everybody pointin' at you 'cause you are not right
We gonna take ten of yours if you ever try take one of mines
Wasn't for me, then you would've been died
If your walls could spit bars, all of they songs be this hard
They said crack kills but my boys sellin' hard
They say last bitch test the work went to Mars
She suck my dick for ten bucks with no arms
That was back when times was hard
That was back before I had these millions that I earned
Wet up your block with a leg and an arm
With that burner we aim at your head and start perms
Keep that shit one hundred, boy you keep it twenty
We just caught an opp, we thought that shit was funny
Funny part about it, we knew we was gon' catch him one day
And on the ground he all up shakin', holdin' on his stomach
Man fuck all them looks
I had to go get that bread so I could put money on them books
That boy look shook every time that he look
But I ain't gotta touch him 'cause karma's a douche
My dreads done got long, this shit just was a bush
I got a boy from the block that's a cook
He whipped up some salmon, taste better than it look
He cookin' dog food, the type that make you woof
You try to take this shit, I'll get you tooked
These niggas snitchin', they tryna write a book
Ninety thousand dollars, that's just for one of my hooks
Please do not compare me to none of these crooks

[Chorus: 03 Greedo]
If these walls could spit bars, all of they songs be this hard
In this game play your cards right or get left to starve
My mama made me a star, I just had it too hard
Bitch I came from the tar but I got high again
I'm thanking God, could have died in the pen
You haven't been 'gainst the odds like I been
You haven't been where I been, I never fold, never bend

[Verse 2: 03 Greedo]
Niggas act like I ain't make the beat to this and Crimey
Like A Nigga, Sweet Lady, Picc A Side, and Slidin'
Murder Music, Makin' Plays, Shittin' Lately, Molly
Legend over night bitch I got songs with everybody
You need help from anybody, you still ain't caught a body
Niggas said they made me poppin', scared to come and get it poppin'
My whole life a livin' hell, bitches come and homicide me
All this time I got, I miss some friends to fuckin' traumatize me
I don't need no man's opinion, not to qualify me
You be spendin' money on your wrist from what the law providin'
Nowadays snitches hangin' out like nigga why we hidin'?
Floatin' 'cross these motherfuckin' hits, just had an out of body
God Level nigga, I bailed out in '16
Greedy rep 03, Uzi rep 16
Platinum albums from a cell, ain't no walkie-talkie
Pushin' button, playin' possum
Hold on, hold up, cops is watchin'

[Chorus: 03 Greedo]
If these walls could spit bars, all of they songs be this hard
In this game play your cards right or get left to starve
My mama made me a star, I just had it too hard
Bitch I came from the tar but I got high again
I'm thanking God, could have died in the pen
You haven't been 'gainst the odds like I been
You haven't been where I been, I never fold, never bend
If these walls could spit bars, all of they songs be this hard
In this game play your cards right or get left to starve
My mama made me a star, I just had it too hard
Bitch I came from the tar but I got high again
I'm thanking God, could have died in the pen
You haven't been 'gainst the odds like I been
You haven't been where I been, I never fold, never bend

[Outro: 03 Greedo]
And we do it for Lil Money
Yeah, long live Lil Money
Oh, money changes everything
I can never give a bitch a wedding ring
Ooh, yeah
Rest in peace to all my niggas
GIP to all my killers, woo
