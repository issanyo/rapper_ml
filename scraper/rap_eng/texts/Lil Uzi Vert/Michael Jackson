[Hook: Shad da God]
Baby girl you Michael Jackson bad
I'm Michael Jackson bad, girl we Michael Jackson bad
She said she wants to fuck me, what bout gettin money yeah
I said I had like 30 on me nah but this ain't cash
Got another hundred worth of jewelry in the bag
How you having soap how you having [?]
How you making [?] how you having swag
Every time I turn up, yeah they turn up on they ass
They don't got no dope no more now the nigga's sad
Imma go out there just like a dog and fishing bag
Imma go back to the basics stacking up the glass
Nigga gon get dropped they dont wanna pay they tabs
Imma put them packs on a nigga like some M's
Count the money once, I ain't fucking up the math
I count the money once and I ain't fucking up the math
I'm 'bout to get all motherfuckin' Benz for the staff

[Verse 1: Shad da God]
I'm 'bout to get all motherfuckin' Benz for my hoe
I'm back to hittin the mafia, big chopper, big bankroll
2 chains go king god
Coming with the [?]
We coming with that money nigga be a silly hoe
[?] take it from him
Nigga askin for advice I told him get your money up
Nigga said he got some 50 told him get a hundred somethin
Nigga I just want Chanel black slipper with no laces
I've been spending hundreds since they had small faces
I just told a nigga had to struggle [?]
I just told em free my nigga Rocco [?]
When you get that mother fucking money what's your name at?
Bitch you rubberband a bankroll 'fore you came here
When you bust the juug do you make sure your folk straight?
When you pour that lean, do you know how good that act' taste (act' taste)

[Hook: Shad da God]

How you having soap how you having [?]
How you making [?] how you having swag

Yeah I know they watching
So I know them boys so mad
Yeah I told them boys keep tabs, yeah
Lil Uzi counting money fast
Driving in that Lambo fast
Yeah you know I'm running through the racks
Cause you know things don't last
Took your girl, made her slow dance
Looked at her mom like "No ma'am"
Slide in the A in the Lamb
Run up on me, it won't jam
Always counting them new bands
Reached in the pocket, my pants
Pulled out my pocket that's 10
Matching that white on white Phantom
