[Chorus]
You tellin me you love me but I know you don't
You tellin me you want me but I want you more
You want to kiss and hug me, I just want your soul
You tellin me you need me but I need you

Girl I got you
But do you got me
Baby, I'd ride for you
But would you ride for me
Baby, I would die for you
But would you die for me
Look me in my eyes and see how much you mean to me

You tell me that you love me but I know you don't
You tell me that you want me but I want you more
You want to kiss and hug me, I just want your soul
You tell me that you need me but baby girl I need you more

[Verse: Lil Uzi Vert]
You tellin' me you love me cause I'm next to blow
I kicked you out my life, you miss them checks the most
I 'member when I dissed you and you left the show
Even though that girl so wrong, miss your sex the most
Don't call me, baby, you're distraction
Had to cancel, why did this even happen
I had to take it slow cause I was on the fast end
I'm not gon' take you home baby that is your last win
I might go so deep in it baby I'm gon' blast in
I cannot lie, that thing so wet, I'm losing traction
No Texico, you know, we gettin' all that gas in
You just was with him last week, you can't have my last name

[Chorus]
You tellin me you love me but I know you don't
You tellin me you want me but I want you more
You want to kiss and hug me, I just want your soul
You tellin me you need me but I need you

Girl I got you
But do you got me
Baby, I'd ride for you
But would you ride for me
Baby, I would die for you
But would you die for me
Look me in my eyes and see how much you mean to me

You tell me that you love me but I know you don't
You tell me that you want me but I want you more
You want to kiss and hug me, I just want your soul
You tell me that you need me but baby girl I need you more

[Outro]
Tryna waste my time
You know you on my mind
Do you wanna be mine
Be my valentine
Girl
