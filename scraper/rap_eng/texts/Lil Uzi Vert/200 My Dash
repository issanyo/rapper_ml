[Verse 1]
Hold up (what)
My new girl yeah that shit fulgar (unh)
Got the chopper with no holster (bah)
That shit might knock on my shoulder (gun sounds)

Drive in the Lamb like a lotus
Twelve pull up told me to slow up (skrr)
Spin around in with a donut (vroom)

And my bullets hit like boulders (damn)
Money so thick I can't fold it (can't fold it)
Can't fit in my pockets so I envelope it (gun sounds)
Double cup I with the potion
Diamonds they hit like the ocean (yah)
Can't read my shirt cause it's Gosha (huh)
Scope got the aim with the ruler (fire)
Swervin' the range that's the Rover (it's fire)
I hit the shot with the floater

I got that bread in the toaster (woah)
I got that bread in the toaster (woah)
