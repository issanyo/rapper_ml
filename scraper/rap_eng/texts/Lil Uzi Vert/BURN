[Hook: Lil Uzi]
Uh, yuh, money don’t fold
Yuh, different day, different episode
Yuh, Kick a J with some penny loafs (what?)
Yuh, Twenty K in the envelope
Yuh, Margiela with the stripe (yuh)
No shoe string, what you tripping for (tripping for)
Real light skin now she pigeon toed (pigeon toe)

[Verse 1: Lil Uzi Vert]
Lil Vera Wang cost a car note
That new Celine cost a Car note
Walk around with my Fendi Goggles (yuh)
Walk around what I am, a model (huh)
Pick her up just like a Tahoe
Fresh down to my socks hoe
Getting money like I won the lotto
All hundreds thats my motto (yuh)
Yeah, I don't want her unless she swallow

[Verse 2: Rich The Kid]
Buy that bitch Chanel, guarantee she’ll swallow (bitch!)
You tricking on these bitches she can’t get a dollar
Dropping the top in the foreign
Sippin' the syrup in the morning (lean)
Trap jumpin' like Jordan
Leave the bitch too boring
Pop a pint, pour up, Actavis throw up (act)
Take your bitch make a movie pass that hoe to Uzi
I sleep with that choppa, need that cheese like pasta
I got all these broke boy check your posture
Old money like a Foster
I got powerball money no lotto
All hundreds thats my motto
She gone swallow for that follow

[Hook: Lil Uzi]
Uh, yuh, money don’t fold
Yuh, different day, different episode
Yuh, Kick a J with some penny loafs
Yuh, 20k in a envelope
Yuh, Margiela with the stripe
No shoe string, what you tripping for (tripping for)
Real light skin and she pigeon toed (pigeon toe)
Lil Vert Wayne cost a car note

[Verse 3: Rich The Kid]
Bought that bitch a bag she wanna marry me
Rich nigga eating steaks don't want no Applebees (rich nigga)
Drive around with that chopper put you in the doctor
I touchdown with Lil Uzi, Fuck them goofy coppers
Sipping the mud in the Syrup, I used to trap on the curb
Got a Benz full of birds, fuck what you heard
Doing donuts in the foreign I ain't go no license
Niggas bout to dab I call em Mike Tyson
Pigeon I been whippin' it
I done made a million, fuckin' stupid bitch
Stay down grinding now I’m fuckin' rich
We done made it Hollywood and never switch

[Hook: Lil Uzi]
Uh, yuh, money don’t fold

Yuh, Kick a J with some penny loafs
Yuh, 20k in a envelope

No shoe string, what you tripping for (tripping for)
Real light skin and she pigeon toed (pigeon toe)
