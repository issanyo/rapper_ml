[Intro]
Haters mad bitch
This That
Take your bitch right on a trip
Let her suck right on my dick
Then I bust right on her tits

[Hook]
This That
Take your bitch right on a trip
Let her suck right on my dick
Then I bust right on her tits
30 that's all on my clip
45th right on my hip
Diamonds my hand look like piss
Drinking that xan like its crisp

[Bridge]
Driving the lamb and its tinted
Inside all white like the winter
I was in north in a bentley
I was on xanny and the benny
That's all that I can remember
That's all that I can remember
I was on xanny and the benny
That's all that I can remember

[Verse]
Gave her that wool like a sweater
You a rat like Master Splinter (rat)
You took that bitch out the bender (what)
I play that bitch like Nintendo
My niggas talk to no [?]
Shoot a drive by out the window
My new bitch won't even hit me
But she give me lots of [?]
Pop a nigga like a pimple
Everyday got a new issue
I remember when my life was so simple
Your whole album not better than my damn intro
Choppa my scope can't miss
Moving some shit, got extended clip too
Got that bitch she got a 50
Whatever you pay I pay triple
Me and you got some of the same friends so your own friends probably gon' hit you
Supply my young niggas with missiles
[?]
I ball and I could play for Timber
I fuck your bitch in my Uptempos
I pull out that's all in your dimples
I fuck that bitch right till she crippled

Tits, huh
Tits bitch

[Hook]
This That
Take your bitch right on a trip
Let her suck right on my dick
Then I bust right on her tits
