[Intro: Lil Uzi]
Hi FKi

[Chorus: Lil Uzi]
I'm gonna ball till I fall, I met that bitch at the mall
Said that she left me no choice
Said that she come from New York
Count that money keep going

[Verse 1: Lil Uzi]
Money coming in every which way
Got ten bitches in every state
Count money when I meditate, count money make me levitate
White Rollie with the bezel face, I'm in a car so I wanna race
So much money I'mma break the safe
So much money I'mma break the bank
Like, fuck nigga what do you really think
Don't wanna smoke it if it ain't no dank, don't wanna fuck her the pussy ain't pink
Sing to your bitch oo I feel like I'm Drake
I just be switching my flow, these niggas stealing my flow
These niggas stealing my clothes, these niggas stealing my look
They tryna steal all my gold, switching it up I keep going
Imma switch it and keep going, imma keep switching keep going
Imma, imma keep switching keep going
Money coming in getting richer, know she looking all at my pictures
No I'm looking all at her pictures, I'm getting money imma get it

It don't even matter cuz its here, nigga fresh really got a scissor

[Chorus: Lil Uzi]
I'm gonna ball till I fall, I met that bitch at the mall
Said that she left me no choice

[Verse 2: Lil Uzi]
Money coming from the bundle

Got your bitch all on me yeah that bitch a bird
Jumping to some money yeah that is a vert
Jumping new hundreds, nigga what you worth
Niggas talk a lot, what is you worth
Niggas talk a lot, what is you worth
Two times your worth, I been getting bitches nigga you a perv
And its coming ASAP like a nigga Ferg
And she giving dome like she is a nerd, putting my fingers all the way up her skirt
Tell me about the money, tell me what its worth
Tell me do it hurt, tell me do you got it
You ain't really got it, looking at his pocket
Got them empty pockets, I got swollen pockets

[Bridge: Lil Uzi]
Money keep coming, the money keep coming

[Chorus: Lil Uzi]
