[Intro]
(Count dem rolls, whoo, count dem rolls)
When a bitch suck my dick, I be like "wooh!"
If I'm counting more than a thousand dollars I be like "wooh!"
Count them rollz! Damn!

[Verse]
The Audi on wrist and the Audi my whip
And the R8 ain't come with a ceiling (skrt)
Tec-9 what I grip, and it got cooling kit and the clip, that bitch got a extension (brr)
The laser on it, a fuck nigga better be quick cause I swear to god I'm not missin'
I probably won't miss, I put a bullet in your head
And change your whole image (I'll kill you)
I just talked to Wiz, I told Addie "call me"
Ain't talk to my guy in a minute (waddup addy)
I went to the party, the bitches all on me
I'm pullin' Brazilian and Remy (suck my dick)
If it bout the Benjis, don't play my Benjis
Bustin' at you with the semi
I 'member when we was fuckin' a shawty in the basement
Her name *beep*
My style doin' damage, diamonds they dancin'
Hair on her neck it be standin'
My pistols be twins, they clip be five-ten
It kinda remind me of Shannon
But I can not worry 'bout Shannon
My niggas eatin', you look famished
I'm drinkin' that lean and I'm xannin'
Lil Uzi gon' be just richer than them
That's word to my nigga Don Cannon
Talkin' that shit then I blam 'em
Wait, that nigga be runnin'
I mean the plural, that nigga rannin'
I got a bitch all on me, yes she be chewin' my dick up
I be just killin' this shit
When she eatin' the nut, it be givin' her hiccups
You should have worked out, shoot you in your stomach
Muthafucka should've did sit-ups
I don't give a fuck muthafucka, now you talkin', nigga, get up
I been gettin' money, how bout you?
Your bitch all on me, how bout you?
How that's your bitch, she suckin' my dick once again
Now she talkin' 'bout you
I told that bitch eat me, I'm killin' it
I told that nigga I be fillin' it
Man Lil Uzi, Lil Uzi, Lil Uzi that nigga on top of Philly like literally
I don't give a fuck lil' nigga, I swear to god I hope that you die
They say "why you dye your hair pink?"
Nigga, I don't know, them xans got me too high
I told that bitch I just be doin' it
Ain't understand me, don't give a fuck
Hit a nigga with a twenty shot
Twenty shot right to his chin like a uppercut
Lil Uzi he just be stupid, told your bitch that I am ruthless
She suckin' my dick and she suckin' my dick
And it feel like that bitch she is toothless
Wooh!

[Bridge]
(take a break count this god damn money, shitt)
Count them rolls, count them rolls, count them rolls
Count them rolls, count them rolls, count them rolls
Count them rolls, count them rolls

[Verse 2]
Just talked to my plug, yeah
He got that Actavis just for him like by check
And you the type nigga that be on the block
Still tryna sip on that Hi-Tech
I don't give a fuck nigga, what the fuck
I might just hit your right up
I told that bitch "suck me up, suck me up, suck me up"
No, no, no, I don't want to fuck
Lil Uzi crazy, Lil Uzi crazy, I did this shit in a day day
I'm gettin' Nachos, movin' that work
I ain't talkin' bout the libre
I'm not with that he say, she say
Not with the he say, she say
I take his main and his side-bitch
And we proceed right to the three-way, damn!

[Outro]
Count them rolls, count them rolls, count them rolls
Count them rolls, count them rolls, count them rolls
Count them rolls, count them rolls, count them rolls
Count them rolls, count them rolls, count them rolls
Count them rolls, count them rolls, count them rolls
Count them rolls, count them rolls
Count them rolls, Uzi Gang, count them rolls
Count them rolls, Uzi Gang, count them rolls
Count them rolls, Uzi Gang, count them rolls
Count them rolls, Uzi Gang, count them rolls
Count them rolls, Uzi Gang, count them rolls
Count them rolls
Like count them rolls, Uzi Gang, count them rolls
Like count them rolls, Uzi Gang, count them rolls
