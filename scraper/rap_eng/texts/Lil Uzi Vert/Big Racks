[Verse 1: Lil Uzi Vert]
Sweep the game right with a broom (Yeah, shh, shh)
Sweep the game right with a broom
Fit right in like I ain't new
I met that bitch in the morning
Fuck that bitch straight by the moon
Used to watch that Sailor Moon
But I still feel like Cocoon
I was broke pockets had room
'Member I didn't have rooms
Now my new crib, that bitch got hundred rooms
I am a winner can't lose
Look count the same money that's over and over and over cause I'm off the shrooms
Like, nigga the fuck is you doing?
My new car engine go vroom
My new car engine go vroom
Wanna race me, you gon' lose (Skrrr)
Different color in my jewels
Stick to my grind, I won't move
Said she want me, man, she too late
Diamond my teeth give me toothache
I figured out something today
All of these niggas they two face

[Chorus: Lil Uzi Vert]
I got racks, I got racks, and my cash straight, yeah
Been had that, been rocked that, boy, you mad late, yeah
I got racks, so this girl keep tryna text me, yeah

I got racks, I got racks, please don't ask me, yeah
I got swag, I got swag, Rick and Raf way, yeah
