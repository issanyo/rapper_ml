Lyrics from Snippet

[Intro: Lil Uzi Vert & MATT OX]
Oogie Mane, he killed it
Supah Mario on the beat, nigga
Oh-oh, pew

[Verse]
Stay so fresh, so clean, think they like me (Like me)
I wear more Supreme than a hypebeast (Than a hypebeast)
Only blue, no green, don't excite me (Green)
I could make a ho out your wifey (Bih)
Jeremy Scott up on my toes, act like Jacquees (Yeah, yeah)
Made her get down on the bottom and she top me (Oh yeah)
Pull up extra icy, I'm not playin' hockey (Hockey, blaow)
Niggas think I'm weird and they don't really like me
'Cause I could fuck your bitch and fuck your mom and auntie (Yeah)
Your girl's a five but your mom is a dime piece (Ayy)
And your auntie, her name is Miss Connie (Miss Connie)
I got one Glock, his name Clyde, the other one named Bonnie (Bonnie)
These bitches, they think they dandy, but they be just lyin' (Bitches lyin')
Got a lil' bitch, can't throw it back, I swear that hoe be tryin' (Try)
When I fuck her from the front, it sound like that bitch dyin' (On God)
VVS, I need a vest, anemiac my diamonds (Woah)
I swear these niggas talk shit, but they really be hidin' (Woo)
Had that boy's bitch on my dick, that hoe, she was just ridin'
Diamonds on my neck, so wet, that shit look like Poseidon (So wet)
I stand on my money, then my height, it turn to 9' 10 (Yeah), yuh
These niggas be bitin' (Fuck, yeah)
Grra-ta, I'm not really with the fightin', yeah (Grra, brra, brra, yeah)
Me and her was vibin' (Yeah), yeah (Yeah)
Your bitch call me Myron (Okay)
90 thousand, that's a light day (Yeah), yeah (That's a light)
I can tell you, it's the real spill (Yeah, I can tell you it's the real), yeah
Fucked your bitch just for a light bill (Yeah), yeah
Banana clip, I ain't gon' slip on the peel (Yeah)
Hot grease, bitch, we poppin' (Poppin'), yeah
Ballin' on that nigga like I'm Thompson (Thompson), yeah
Chopper got splendid, was like the Johnson (Johnson)
Johnson Johnson, vacation right to Dubai (Dubai)
Kicking shit so hard, I stopped doin' ju-tai (Mwah)
20 thousand Christian Dior on my shoota (Yeah)
Got a black girl and she got blue eyes (Eyes)
Can up, on the real, got 'em shoes tied

[Chorus]
Starin' at lil' homie
Stop, starin' at lil' homie
You ain't fairin' nothin' on me
We ain't hearin' that lil' homie
Pull up 'Claren on new homie
Skrr-skrr, pull up on my homie
I just fucked all her friends
She start cheerin' on her homies
I just ran up all my bands
I just ran up all my bands
I just ran up all my bands
I just ran up all my bands
She give me head, that be my migraine
She give me head, that be my migraine
