[Verse 1: Lil Uzi Vert]
Damn, Lil Uzi turned to the man (I did)
Pull up, no Range, this a Lamb' (Skrr)
Pull up on me, you get faint (Fire)
She drop to her knees, use no hands (What?)
Run through the money, toe jam (Usain)
Saw what you got in your savings (Damn)
Got more than that in my stash (Uh)
Thumb through the money and laugh (Huh)
Grab your lil' bitch and slow dance (What?)
Thousand dollar for my pants (Uh-huh)
Twenty thousand my left pocket (Damn)
Ten thousand in my right pocket (What?)
Dolly come through with the MAC (Bow)
Uzi come through, digi' dash (Aye)
Chichi come through with the strap

Pablo gon' finish the rest
We stackin' these checks, and we movin' like chess
Me and Lil Dada, we doggin' your bae

[Verse 3: Hoodrich Pablo Juan]
24 karat, red gold
We don't fuck with you niggas, you really some hoes
Chain on my neck, it make my heart cold
I'm a slime ass nigga, I'll wipe a nigga nose
Kickin' shit like I got steel toes
I tripped [?] and it still sold
Don't play with that fuck shit, that what we got trips for
I need a Dolly-Dolly, I got a truck load
Rappers remind me of CB4
Hit the plug for the stash, Gusto
They kidnap for ransom, they cut throat (gimme that)

[Verse 4: Lil Chichi]
All of my niggas they cut throat
They rather put you on a boat load
All of my niggas some convicts
Walk around with the hammers and sticks
I send my young niggas, full blitz
Lil Chichi gon' pull up and handle this shit
Pablo gon' send em from Eastwyck
My slime niggas got me seasick
Diamond boogas, yeah you bitches can't see it
Red bottoms how I'm kickin' this shit
Rollie bezzle, take a look at my wrist
YSL, nigga you know that we rich
Chichi gon' come with the case like a brick
