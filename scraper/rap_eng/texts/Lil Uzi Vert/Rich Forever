[Chorus]
Make it rain and I leave it there
I don't ever clean the mess up
Buddakan, bitch, we eat in there
So dark, can't see in there
Still took a bitch to eat in there
She said, "How you pull off in your whip if there ain't no key in there?" (skrrt)
New coupe can fit three in there

[Interlude]
Woo, woo
Woo, woo
Woo, woo
Yeah, yeah, yeah, whatever
Woo, woo
Woo, woo
This is a Dolan Beats production
Ayy, ayy, ayy, yeah

[Verse]
I pull up in Bentley, no Beamer
Balenciaga, these not no Arenas
I got a chopper, could clear whole arenas
I got a llama, I named that bitch Tina
I let that lil' bitch just hold on my Nina
You know I stay, don't have to get my cheese up
I remember that bitch wasn't a speaker
Now I'm the only thing come out her speakers
These niggas bummy, they mad from the bleachers
I get the cake like I work for Denise's
Violation, boy, your money like Wee Man
These soft ass niggas can't fuck with the demon
You know Lil Uzi got the bitches fiendin'
I got the Glock, and my laser is beamin'
These niggas borin', tell me when they're leavin'
Rainbow my diamonds, but I am not readin'
These niggas old, yeah, their hairlines recedin'
Go get the money, blue checks I'm receivin'
Like Kells with the R so I hit with the remix
I gave the thot a pill, she went to Venus
She on her knees and she beg for the semen
Rick Owens my bed, I drip when I'm dreamin'
Bitch, out my way, at the top, you can't glo me
Did everything so it's nothin' you can show me
I'm the type nigga that wave out in front on you
I'ma just pass you just right to my homie (Woo)
I'm the type nigga that wave out in front on you
Take the safety off, and blast my opponent (Yah)
These rappers pitiful, also my children too
I don't know why they're always actin' bogus
One of my youngest children just went platinum
Startin' to think he better than my oldest
Hold up, pneumonia neck got me froze up (Froze)
Made three million off my shoulders (Shoulders)
Drippin', drownin' in the water (Yeah)
Got more money than your father (Yeah)
So that means you're my daughter (Daughter)
Choppers on me, I got 40 (40)
Jack boys rip the floor up (Floor up)
Sawed-off getting taught (Bow)
Stomach shot, get your core (Core)
Went 2Pac, watch the door (Door)
2Pac, that's Shakur (Kur)
Nigga better watch his whore (Yeah)
I'ma send him to the Lord (Lord)
He was on life support ('Port)
But the doctor pulled the cord (Cord)
That's what happen when we warrin' (Woo)
1600, leave you snorin' (Woo)
Catch a carbon, that's a Corbin (Woo)
Blue tips in the FN
It's G.E.D. like I'm testin' (G.E.D.)
Get every dollar with no dressin' (Yeah)
They won't play this on your FM (Ayy)
You a rat, call the PC
That's the pest control, not protection
Tell my bitch, "You his best friend?"
Oh no, bitch, you gon' text him (What?)
Let him ease in my section (Section)
We gon' hit him with a message (message)
We got shooters out in Essex (Essex)
We got shooters out in Texas (Texas)
All my niggas know, it's wreck shit (Wreck shit)
Throw your set, throw your set, bitch (Set, bitch)
You keep showin' me your new bitch
Boy, you're fuckin' on my ex-bitch
She with you for a check, bitch
Gave her racks, diamond necklace (Necklace)
You can keep it, I got extra (Extra)
No, they can't out-check us (check us)
Spend a hundred, put the rest up (Yeah)
Niggas tryna be the best us

[Chorus]
Make it rain and I leave it there
I don't ever clean the mess up
Buddakan, bitch, we eat in there
So dark, can't see in there
Still took a bitch to eat in there
She said, "How you pull off in your whip if there ain't no key in there?" (skrrt)
New coupe can fit three in there

[Outro]
Smoke a blunt, 4 G's in there
Goyard wallet with the cheese in there
Margiela, put my feet in there (Yeah)
VVS', put my teeth in there (Yeah)
High 20's, you get C's in there
Francisville, I ain't leavin' there
1600, yeah, I be in there
Come around, you get whacked here (Whacked here)
Come around, you get wet here (Wet)
Come around, you get checked here (Checked here)
