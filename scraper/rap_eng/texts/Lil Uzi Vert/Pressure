[Hook: Lil Durk]
My niggas young and they reckless
How they gon' serve and protect us?
Don't count me in and neglect us
That's why I can turn up off pressure
Pressure, pressure, pressure, pressure

[Verse 1: Lil Uzi Vert]
The government lying and people keep dying
A nigga the fuckin' man
I look out my window, I look at the TV
This shit look like a bad dream
I see heroes turnin' enemies
Hero dying in the six
Pull up car next to me
They don't shoot, that's a blessing
But you bet I came with my weapon
But you bet I came with my weapon
They be black on black crimes
But white on black crimes ain't be catchin'
Actually that shit been happening
They be hanging us for centuries
That shit happened from beginning
Hang us straight from the ceiling
That what you call lynching
Keep the .40 with extension
They try to make my race extinct
We ain't goin' without a fight

[Hook: Lil Durk]
My niggas young and they reckless
How they gon' serve and protect us?
Don't count me in and neglect us
That's why I can turn up off pressure
Pressure, pressure, pressure, pressure

[Verse 2: Lil Uzi Vert]
I'm at all my homies funerals and my relatives die of old age
The jack boys is after me, 12 is after me, [?] nowhere is safe
Cops be shootin' up innocents souls
So we ain't got no time to waste
They depended on me, all eyes on me, like I'm finna' win the game
I don't trust none of you niggas, only the family be the gang
All of my niggas got pistols but bullets ain't got no name
If they get you they kill you so we gon' do the same
But they won't get life in prison, only leave without pay
They control population, population away
2-2-3 bullet pistol, obligation okay
Turnin' up for Baltimore
Rest in peace Freddie Gray

[Hook: Lil Durk]
My niggas young and they reckless
How they gon' serve and protect us?
Don't count me in and neglect us
That's why I can turn up off pressure
Pressure, pressure, pressure, pressure
