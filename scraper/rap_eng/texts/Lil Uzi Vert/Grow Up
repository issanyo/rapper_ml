[Verse 1]
(Lil Uzi!)
Yeah, no cake
In your pockets, no cake
In your pockets, no bank
No big bank, you ain't
Got no wallet, no bank
In your what?
I got bank in my pocket, no hoes
On your roster, you niggas, y'all is imposters
Yeah, kicked it one time with your girl
And I swear we play soccer
Damn, I do not keep her
Hey, 'cause that girl, she is a bopper
Yeah, pass her right to my friend Zay
Yeah, I turn that girl to a hopper
Hey, she jump on top in the back
Hey, I told that girl she a topper
Hey, Alexander and McQueen
Yeah, pants so clean they look like some Dockers
Ride it four stroke and I crank the Dorado
This shit so sturdy I wheelie through potholes
Somewhere in the Philippines
Yeah my new girl, she look just like a model
Don't know if she feelin' me
Oh she really, I'm just chasin' it

[Chorus]
She ride my dick 'til I slow up (yeah!)

[Verse 2]
Why do these boys hate?
Oooh, yeah, but they don't know me
Yeah, ballin' like Kobe (I'm ballin')
Yeah, flooded my Rollie, yeah
Diamonds on solar
Diamonds got colder
Other words: diamonds got polar
Chopper on shoulder
Got range like Rover (woah)
If she don't wanna stay I won't hold her (I won't)
But first better give me brain 'til your throat hurt (yeah)
I'm young enough for your daughter
Young enough for your daughter
Yeah, diamonds look like water
The water in Bora Bora (hey)
Got money all on the floor
My baby galore, she look like Laura
Yeah, had to cut her off, feelin' like Zoro
I'm just playin', I'll see her tomorrow (I'll see her)
Yeah my diamonds hittin' like stars
Yeah my diamonds hittin' like stars
24 karat, see in the dark
Yeah, last night it was dark (hey)
Had your girl in my car
Didn't make it to my crib, that thing, it was parked
Yeah, I hit that thing in the park (ooh)
Yeah, heard her last man was a narc
Yeah, he really don't got no heart
Yeah, sabre my tooth like a shark

[Chorus]
She ride my dick 'til I slow up (yeah!)
Drink Hennessy 'til she throw up
Yeah, she 'bout to go up (ugh)
Hey, she really tore up (damn, mil')
I got my dough up (yeah, yeah)
Say I took your style
Nigga just grow up (oh well)
She ride my dick 'til I slow up (yeah!)
Drink Hennessy 'til she throw up

Say I took your style
Nigga just grow up (oh well)
