[Pre-Chorus]
I said, "Girl, why you keep callin'?"
I said, "Girl, why you keep callin'?" (Yeah)
She said, "I need a new whip (yeah)
'Cause I know that you still ballin'"
She just wanna go back to the future, so I brought that girl a DeLorean
Twenty more minutes until I got' go, so I told that girl that I'm gonna slaughter it

[Chorus]
I met that girl right up at my show
Left her man in the crowd on the floor
Out of town never saw her before
Told her, "Baby, we don't got that long"
Listen, this is not my city show
But, I treat it like my city show
Twenty more minutes until I'm on
Twenty more minutes until I'm on
Twenty more minutes until I'm on
Twenty more minutes until I'm on
Twenty more minutes until I'm on
Twenty more minutes until I'm on (yeah)
I am not slow
These girls just want me 'cause I got the dough
Pass that girl right on my friend, give and go
He pass me her friend, so they switchin' roles (yeah)

[Verse 1]
I hit it fast (fast), yeah, I hit it slow (slow)
But by the mornin', girl, I gotta go (yeah)
I gotta get ready, tonight is my show
If you okay, you might open my show
Got the big pointers right under my nose
These niggas mad 'cause I got all the dough
These niggas mad 'cause I got all the dough (yah!)
Changin' my style 'cause I got every flow
Got every girl, ain't no toppin' my hoes (yah!)
I understand that is your girlfriend, bro
But, you know I gotta keep her close
Open your legs and I keep 'em closed
Livin' life on the edge, on a tightrope
I am so clean, I might start movin' soap (yah)
Drive a new 'Rari, I don't need a note (skrrr!)
Drive a Bugatti like it's a Volvo
I got your girl and you already know (skrrr!)
Don't really like her, we friends for the most
Cuban link tri-color, all on my choker(skrrr!)
Don't leave the crumb, got the bread, then you toast
If you start touchin' my gun, got no holst'
I put a coat on top of my coat
Only 20 minutes before the show (show)

[Chorus]
I met that girl right up at my show
Left her man in the crowd on the floor
Out of town, never saw her before
Told her, "Baby, we don't got that long"
Listen, this is not my city show
But, I treat it like my city show
Twenty more minutes until I'm on
Twenty more minutes until I'm on
Twenty more minutes until I'm on (yeah)
Twenty more minutes until I'm on
Twenty more minutes until I'm on
Twenty more minutes until I'm on (yeah)
I am not slow
These girls just want me 'cause I got the dough
Pass that girl right on my friend, give and go (what)
He pass me her friend, so they switchin' roles (yeah)

[Verse 2]
Damn, I just started it (started)
Man, I just started it
Oh my God, please do not bother me
Don't got enough just to order me (yeah)
I'm on that tree like an ornament
Money so long like accordion (woo)
You lied to me, wasn't sorry then
On the weekend, you was partyin'
It was just me, you was targetin' (yeah)
It was just me, you was targetin' (target)
Jump in the Porsche, I might target it (skrr)
Jump in the Lamb, I ain't parkin' it (skrrr)
Ice is so cold, I snowboard in it (blaow)
Go to my show, they applaud me in
She call my phone with emergency (ayy)
She call my phone with that urgency (ayy)

[Pre-Chorus]
I said, "Girl, why you keep callin'?" (ayy)
I said, "Girl, why you keep callin'?" (Yeah)
She said, "I need a new whip (yeah)
'Cause I know that you still ballin'" (ball!)
She just wanna go back to the future, so I brought that girl a DeLorean (yah)
Twenty more minutes until I got' go, so I told that girl that I'm gonna slaughter it (yah)

[Chorus]
I met that girl right up at my show
Left her man in the crowd on the floor
Out of town, never saw her before
Told her, "Baby, we don't got that long"
Listen, this not my city show
But, I treat it like my city show
Twenty more minutes until I'm on
Twenty more minutes until I'm on
Twenty more minutes until I'm on
Twenty more minutes until I'm on
Twenty more minutes until I'm on
Twenty more minutes until I'm on (yeah)
I am not slow
These girls just want me 'cause I got the dough
Pass that girl right on my friend, give and go (what?)
He pass me her friend, so they switchin' roles (yah)
Yah!
