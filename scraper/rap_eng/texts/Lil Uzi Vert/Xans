[Intro]
Oh, oh, ohhh
Oh, oh, ohhh

[Hook: Lil Uzi Vert]
I done fell in love with the Zans
Got a whole scrip in my hands
(Got a whole scrip in my hands)
Your girlfriend my number one fan
(Your girlfriend my number one fan)
And I fuck that bitch off the Zans
(And I fuck that bitch off the Zans)
She done fell in love with the Zans
(She done fell in love with the Zans)
I done fell in love with the Zans
(I done fell in love with the Zans)
She done fell in love with the Zans
(She done fell in love with the Zans)
I done fell in love with the Zans
(I done fell in love with the Zans)

[Verse 1: Yakki Divioshi]
I'm so high, I'm so fly, I don't plan on landin'
When I ride, keep that tool just like I'm a cannon
On the (?), thousand packs like a bag of candy
They come white, they come yellow, they come green like lemons
Don't do molly, don't do molly, can't fuck with that Zan then
Fuck that air, pop that ho, and take a trip to Zanland
100 thousand, 200 thousand, let me do my band dance
Balmain dream, new Margiela, (?)
Double G, double G, we mix that up with the lean
When I'm on the bars I get to itchin' like a dog that came with fleas
Cause bitch I'm gettin' it
(?) I caught myself talkin' to a tree
And he talked back and he told me, better roll up a blunt and leave

She done fell in love with the Zans

I done fell in love with the Zans
(I done fell in love with the Zans)
She done fell in love with the Zans
(She done fell in love with the Zans)
I done fell in love with the Zans

[Verse 2: Lil Uzi Vert]
I take two of that, girl take three
I like school (?)
When I drink the lean all I see is z's
When I drink the lean all I see is z's
Told your girl get up on her knees
My new car don't take no keys
I take Zannies in my sleep
Take a piss now it's Zannies in my pee
And there's skeet all up in my face
Oh that bitch ain't good she a freak
Little Uzi always off the juice
My Cartiers cost a G
