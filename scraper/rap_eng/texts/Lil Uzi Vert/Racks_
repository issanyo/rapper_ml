[Verse: Lil Uzi Vert]
Oou, bitch that's a fact
You be hanging with a rat
We have bitches from [?]
I was pulling out they track
That was all the way back
Way before I had the sack
[?]
Know this ain't tennis but I got the racks

[Chorus: Shabazz PBG]
Know this ain't tennis but I got the racks
Know this ain't tennis but I got the racks
Know this ain't tennis but I got the racks
Whatever I spend you know I get it back
Know this ain't tennis but I got the racks
Know this ain't tennis but I got the racks
Know this ain't tennis but I got the racks
Whatever I spend you know I get it back
Know this ain't tennis but I got the racks
Know this ain't tennis but I got the racks
Know this ain't tennis but I got the racks
Whatever I spend you know I get it back
Know this ain't tennis but I got the racks
Know this ain't tennis but I got the racks
Know this ain't tennis but I got the racks
Whatever I spend you know I get it back
Lil' bitch!
