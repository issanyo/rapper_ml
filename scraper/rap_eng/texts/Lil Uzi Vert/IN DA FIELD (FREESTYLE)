40. Glock posted on the block
And my shorty pop when that forty stop
You a cold rat informing cops
And all we do is hit the ops
Got a forty shot in your fitted cap
Bitch sucking dick and she been a thot
Riding four Gs with them [?]
She sipping lean, get high a lot
We busting shells and we throwing shots
From Philadel' where they die a lot
You ain't putting in work, you ain't high a lot
Only thing you do is lie a lot
I know some niggas that sock the cops
I know some niggas that shot a cop
I'm 'bout my cream, Promethazine
And I whip the til' my til' my hand lock
She sucking dick, nut in her eyes
Fucked her so hard she feel paralyzed
