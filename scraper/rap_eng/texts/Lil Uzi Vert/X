[Intro: Young Nudy, Young Thug & Lil Uzi Vert]
Yo, yo Pi'erre, you wanna come out here?
Metro!
I love you
I don't want you

[Chorus: Lil Uzi Vert]
I don't know whats next, yeah
I don't want my ex, no
Break up with a text
I'm not tryna flex (What? What)
Girl you know the, rest (Bye bye, hoe)
Bitch I write a check
Walkin' with a check (With a check)
Take off in a jet (I don't want my ex)
So I just never stress

[Verse 1: Lil Uzi Vert]
I could never stress (Stress)
Yeah, my life's a mess (Pew, pew)
But I'm also blessed (Blessed)
My heart's in the junkyard cause it's wrecked
And today's not feeling like it used to
You got stuck up in that life that you was used to
If you got hurt, yeah, I got hurt, yeah, I got bruised too
That's the main reason why I had to choose you
If you got options I got options, baby, who you?
I got one that's on my line that look like new new
She got ass just like a zebra on a zoo too
So basically what I'm saying, I'm not scared to lose you

[Chorus: Lil Uzi Vert]
I don't want my ex (aye)
Break up with a text
I'm not tryna flex (what, what)
Girl you know the, rest (bye bye, hoe)
Bitch I write a check
Walkin' with a check
Take off in a jet
So I just never stress

[Verse 2: Lil Uzi Vert]
Leonardo DiCaprio
Watch out, boys, I might bag your hoe
Love so strong, that shit had me gone
Didn't care too, I was all alone
Swag on them by mistake
I cannot believe that I made this shit from a mixtape
Bitch, you know I'm flooded, you know my momma wrist straight
Grandma don't like diamonds, she say "Make sure that my rent's paid," yeah
And I make sure that your rent's paid
Make you live your own life when you hung out with Lindsay
I don't want you never ever running in a frenzy
But that's just some shit that everybody's friends say

[Chorus: Lil Uzi Vert]
I don't know whats next, yeah
I don't want my ex, no (I don't want her back)
Break up with a text
I'm not tryna flex (What? What)
Girl you know the, rest (Bye bye, hoe)
Bitch I write a check
Walkin' with a check (With a check)
Take off in a jet (I don't want my ex)
So I just never stress
