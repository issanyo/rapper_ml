Lyrics from Snippet

My diamonds go retarded
Keep droolin', got my wrist wet
Told a bad girl, "Get your lips wet"
Told a bad girl, "Get your lips wet"
Told a bad girl, "Let's just sex"
Told a bad girl, "Let me hit that"
You can lay your head on my six pack
'Cause you know we go way back
Way, way, way, way back
