[Intro: Tony Zuko]
RJ always trippin', man
RJ always trippin'
West to east (I've been gettin' money!)
Dexter Ave, hundred years

[Verse 1: Tony Zuko]
I've been on a roll, man you can't stop me
All black leather jacket lookin' like Fonzie
Big bankroll of 20s, lookin' hella sloppy
And I wish you niggas well, well like Bonzi
Sittin' in the car low, no it's not a Monti
Back in middle school I used to wanna fuck Ashanti
If I don't win at the end like that nigga Rocky
Bury me inside a Benz like Maserati
Rick, nigga, I be mobbin' like John Gotti
Niggas call me Mr. Biggs like Ron Isley
I'm a bad boy, baby like Mike Lowery
Gettin' money with no job, nigga, like Tommy
I need my money ASAP, nigga, that's Rocky
New Rollie on my wrist, jack boys watch me
All the way up at the top, niggas can't top me
Grammy noms and platinum plaques, got a nigga cocky

[Hook: Lil Uzi Vert]
Just left a bomb bitch for a bomb bitch (bomb bitch)
I ain't really with the nonsense (nonsense)
Niggas' hoes lookin' like five cents, yeah
I'm walkin' 'round with a dime bitch
My dime bitch got a dime bitch (dime bitch)
Her dime bitch got a dime bitch (got a dime bitch)
I ain't take a deal, I ain't sign shit, no
Fuck with me, nigga, let the nine spit, yeah

[Verse 2: Lil Uzi Vert + Tony Zuko]
Ayy, get money, we know
Do this shit straight for my people
Lookin' through the peephole
Your girl was butt naked, it was sorta like a peep show
He made that bitch his wifey, but we know that bitch a freak hoe
And when that hoe yawn, yeah I knew that was a deepthroat
Yeah, put me in the Matrix, I felt like Neo
Bruh you know these hoes be lyin'
I should know, I'm a Leo
And she brought her friend
So you know we had a trio
You know I'm only 20 and that bitch like a 3-0
Her boyfriend be hatin', old bitch ass C.O
81 catches, I'm a plug like I'm T.O
Saint Laurent pants, don't be jockin' on my steelo

[Hook: Lil Uzi Vert]
Just left a bomb bitch for a bomb bitch (bomb bitch)
I ain't really with the nonsense (nonsense)
Niggas' hoes lookin' like five cents, yeah
I'm walkin' 'round with a dime bitch
My dime bitch got a dime bitch (dime bitch)
Her dime bitch got a dime bitch (got a dime bitch)
I ain't take a deal, I ain't sign shit, no
Fuck with me, nigga, let the nine spit, yeah

[Outro]
I've been gettin' money!
