[Hook: Shy Glizzy]
Young man pull your pants
Sorry I can't help it get your bands up
I can't understand why they want me in handcuffs
I'm the man everybody put your hands up

Real niggas signin' up for my fan club

[Verse 1: Shy Glizzy]
Glizzy glizzy back out just got jammed up
Boy my trap house look like Sams Club

Boy You better not let them take your man hood
Niggas hit my spot they thought that was their spot

[Verse 2: Lil Uzi Vert]
First off, Uzi Gang over everything
Let that gun go when I was 17
That bitch had lil pole on her at like 17
Uzi tats all on my hoes, they lookin' up to me
All of these hoes I feel Like I'm John Massey
Drivin' that shit on my D she dancin'
Ain't suckin' dick then that bitch gettin' canceled
I start gettin' money now they think I'm handsome
Pour up and pour up that lean in the fanta
Might skrt in the Rari, might pull up in Phantom
My diamonds be dancin', pull up to a mansion
I line up with bitches and they don't be running
Diamonds in the grill got a nigga grinnin'
Members days I ain't even have a penny
Colder than the winter, hotter than the summer
Skrtin' in a Hummer, skrtin' in a Hummer
Feel like birdman number one stunna
10 chains, 10 rings, small change in my pocket that be like 10 bands
Whats the pants, lil nigga Balmain
