[Chorus: Lil Uzi Vert & Iggy Azalea]
I might pull up in the coupe, yeah
Yeah my car don't got no roof, yeah
All that fake shit be killin' my mood
I am a winner, can't lose
Yeah, hey
I am a winner, can't lose
Keep on winnin', I can't lose, yeah
I am not worried 'bout you
Winnin', winnin', winnin', winnin'
Money stuffed inside the linenDisrespect from the beginnin'
And I hope that you offended
Yeah, hey
Yeah I really cannot lose
I am a winner, can't lose, yeah
I am a winner, can't lose, yeah

[Verse 1: Iggy Azalea]
Dat way
You ain't talkin' 'bout the money? Go that way
If you late with the check, I need back pay
All these diamonds on my neck, I feel fancy
Strang√©, on the cover of the front page lookin' bomb, ayy
Yeah I got a couple houses and they all paid
Now I don't need a stylist, I'm rockin' Balmain
And I'm countin' up the commas every time the phone ring
Hollup, stick
Pull up in the Jeep with the kick (woo)
Got new feet on the bitch (woo)
Lookin' like a check 'cause I'm rich (rich)
Hollup, stick
Pull up in the Jeep with the kick (woo)
Got new feet on the bitch (woo)
Lookin' like a check 'cause I'm rich

[Pre-Chorus: Iggy Azalea]
Can't believe they try to play us
You could never ever fade us
Trust me, we don't need no favors
And we got that paper way up

[Chorus: Lil Uzi Vert & Iggy Azalea]
I might pull up in the coupe, yeah
Yeah my car don't got no roof, yeah
All that fake shit be killin' my mood
I am a winner, can't lose
Yeah, hey
I am a winner, can't lose
Keep on winnin', I can't lose, yeah
I am not worried 'bout you
Winnin', winnin', winnin', winnin'
Money stuffed inside the linen
Disrespect from the beginnin'
And I hope that you offended
Yeah, hey
Yeah I really cannot lose
I am a winner, can't lose, yeah
I am a winner, can't lose, yeah

[Verse 2: Iggy Azalea]
I just did a show, a couple million
Fuck opinions, yeah, fuck your feelings
Bitch I'm all about the better livin'
You ain't even got a pot to piss in
I just rounded up another digit
Mathematics with the honor roll
Leprechaun with that pot of gold
Bet you wanna taste the rainbow
Really, I'm a fan favorite
Really I'm your man's favorite
Always been above basic
Always been above the fake shit
Wax on, wax off (woo)
Karate chop with the sauce (woo)
Never worried 'bout the cost (what?)
I just get it like a boss, dat way

[Pre-Chorus: Iggy Azalea]
Can't believe they try to play us
You could never ever fade us
Trust me, we don't need no favors
And we got that paper way up

[Chorus: Lil Uzi Vert & Iggy Azalea]

Yeah my car don't got no roof, yeah
All that fake shit be killin' my mood
I am a winner, can't lose
Yeah, hey

And I hope that you offended
Yeah, hey

I am a winner, can't lose, yeah
I am a winner, can't lose, yeah
