[Chorus: Lil Uzi Vert]
Don't be rude
Like my bitches to come in twos
That's my rule
You's a fool
If you think that yo' bool
Wasn't stuck to me like glue
Don't rock Jays
Okay, I might rock ones
Okay, don't rock two's
Who's those dudes?
Okay, that's my goons
When I say they shoot
Shoot
Don't be rude
Like my bitches to come in twos
That's my rule
You's a fool
If you think that yo' bool
Wasn't stuck to me like glue
Don't rock Jays
Okay, I might rock ones
Okay, don't rock two's
Who's those dudes?
Okay, that's my goons
When I say they shoot
Shoot
