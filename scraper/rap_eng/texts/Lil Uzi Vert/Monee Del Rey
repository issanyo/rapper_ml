[Chorus: DJ Diamond Kuts]
I got racks, I got clothes, I got hoes
I got shooters, I ain't worried about yours
I got racks, I got clothes, I got hoes
I got shooters, I ain't worried about yours
I got racks, I got clothes, I got hoes
I got shooters, I ain't worried about yours
I got racks, I got clothes, I got hoes
I got shooters, I ain't worried about yours

[Verse 1: Lil Uzi Vert]
I'm gonna ball 'til I fall
Lil Uzi never gon' fall
Aye, my money stacked eight feet tall
Aye, told your bitch to drop them drawers
I swear to god, it was nothin'
Turn that shit right into somethin'
All of my bitches, they bustin', aye
All of my bitches they bustin', aye
Aim at your head like concussion, aye
Nigga that be repercussion, aye
All of my niggas they bustin', aye
All of my niggas they bustin', aye
Most of these niggas be busters, aye
All of my niggas they hustlers, aye
Lil Uzi ball like a rucker, aye
Don't want your bitch, want your mother, aye
In the trap, nigga, I'm whippin', aye
Nigga, I'm whippin' that supper, aye
If the cops come, I'm gon' flush it, aye
If the cops come, I'm gon' flush it, aye

[Chorus: DJ Diamond Kuts]
I got racks, I got clothes, I got hoes
I got shooters, I ain't worried about yours
I got racks, I got clothes, I got hoes
I got shooters, I ain't worried about yours
I got racks, I got clothes, I got hoes
I got shooters, I ain't worried about yours
I got racks, I got clothes, I got hoes
I got shooters, I ain't worried about yours

[Verse 2: Lil Uzi Vert]
Aye, sippin' that lean, I'm monster
My bitch, she look like Teyana
Chopper big like Iman Shumpert
Rockin' that Wang, Alexander
Sometimes I feel like Iâ€™m Shabba
Kanye told me he was happy
Four of my hoes got family
Now I be gettin' them dollars
Diddy be given' me knowledge
Xan in the lean give me power
Tear up the pussy, got molly
I be whippin' the chowder
My bitch, she be in college
What the fuck you talk about me
Little Uzi got the dollars, aye
2050 in the hunnid
Nigga, I'm stuntin'
I'm gettin' money
You don't get nothin'
I'm countin' the comma
Lil Uzi gettin' the dollars
I be designer
I ain't worried 'bout your homie

[Chorus: DJ Diamond Kuts]
I got racks, I got clothes, I got hoes
I got shooters, I ain't worried about yours
I got racks, I got clothes, I got hoes
I got shooters, I ain't worried about yours
I got racks, I got clothes, I got hoes
I got shooters, I ain't worried about yours
I got racks, I got clothes, I got hoes
I got shooters, I ain't worried about yours
I got racks, I got clothes, I got hoes
I got shooters, I ain't worried about yours
I got racks, I got clothes, I got hoes
I got shooters, I ain't worried about yours
I got racks, I got clothes, I got hoes
I got shooters, I ain't worried about yours
I got racks, I got clothes, I got hoes
I got shooters, I ain't worried about yours
