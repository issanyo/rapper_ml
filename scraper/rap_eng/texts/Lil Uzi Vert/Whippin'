You say it up front, by the way man I tell a bitch
And why you ain't sayin' shit? cause Uzi, got hella bandz

I aim at your face, 50 shot make ya ass bellydance
I don't give a fuck, that means that my thoughts be celibate
And you keep on talkin', but my nigga, I swear, I'm relevant
The money the money the money the money

Yo bitch all on me, she think that she funny

No 65 hunnid dollar on me, cause a nigga be straight stuntin'
And now yo bitch want me, got the work, now servin' undie
I move like I want to, on the block, movin' the onions
Leggo
