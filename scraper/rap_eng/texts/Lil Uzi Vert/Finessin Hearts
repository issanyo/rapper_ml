Promethazine got me in a dream
Smokin' gas, lungs collapse
Xanny bars, take 'em by the threes
Man, you need to relax
All these drugs, feel like a junkie
It won't bring her back
And if I thought anybody really had my back
It'd be you, know you still my boo thang
Pull up in V, in that Mulsanne
Kick game so retarded, it's Liu Kang
Do anything for you cause I'm a fool, mane

[Bridge]
Pacing myself and I'm running the game just like Usain, yeah
No matter what, feel that shit in my gut, you're my boo thang
I might just pull up in Porsche and I drive like a boss, swervin' two lanes
She said you is too lame
Luv Is Rage too flames
