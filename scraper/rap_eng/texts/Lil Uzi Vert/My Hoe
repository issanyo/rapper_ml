[Verse 1]
Got a big dick that'll flip a hoe
And my main bitch she be pigeon toed, pigeon toed
And I get like twelve zips a show, zips a show
Back off the stage and I dick a hoe
You know when that pussy dick a hoe
The whiff on that bitch prolly rip a hoe
She kiss on the dick with no mistletoe
She lick on the tip make it drip a little
[?] and breather
Diamonds they anemic
Cartier I'm seeing
Balling for no reason
I don't trust these niggas
They changing just like seasons
I'm a steak and lobster eating
Balling for no reason

[Hook]
You can't fuck my hoe
You can't fuck my hoe
You can't fuck my hoe
You can't fuck my hoe
I barely fuck my hoe
I barely fuck my hoe
I barely fuck my hoe
I barely fuck my hoe

[Verse 2]
Money for my hoe
Money for my hoe
Money for my hoe

Getting this paper it going
Bitch on my dick and she going
Look at my chain and its snowing
Look at my wrist and its glowing
She suck my dick now she blowing
I get the money you saying
You saying aye because of me
Bitches on me easy a, b, c
I got the bitch now 1, 2, 3
She want to fuck up all on me
Put on a condom cause I don't want a disease

[Hook]
You can't fuck my hoe
You can't fuck my hoe
You can't fuck my hoe
You can't fuck my hoe
I barely fuck my hoe
I barely fuck my hoe

I barely fuck my hoe

[Verse 3]
Your dollars up

No love in a monster truck
Ya nigga you really suck
Ya your bitch really suck
Now you missing her

Lil Uzi be dissing her, fuck her
Lil Uzi be pimping her

[Hook]
You can't fuck my hoe
You can't fuck my hoe
You can't fuck my hoe
You can't fuck my hoe
I barely fuck my hoe
I barely fuck my hoe
I barely fuck my hoe
I barely fuck my hoe
