[Intro]
God damn its your motherfuckin' boy Lil Uzi
The mob, the God damn OG gas, the God damn Cartier shawty
God damn grilled up shawty
God damn Balmain shawty
Hey you know I have a feelin'
But I fuck with some niggas from LA too

[Verse 1]
Woke up this mornin' with your motherfuckin' bitch
Smacked her on the ass while she cooked me eggs and grits
After I'm done with her, send her back to your crib
You gon' kiss her lips like she ain't suck my dick
Run it, run it, run it, get a check and run it up
She gon' eat the team, swallow mine, come straight for lunch
Went to LA, 305 picked me up
We just flex on bustas, keep that number nine tucked
Call up IAmSu! nigga, what the fuck is up?
Call up IAmSu! for the Cartier plug
Me and IAmSu! talkin' bout bitches that we want
Smokin' OG gas, purple shit in my lungs
