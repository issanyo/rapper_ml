[Intro: Gucci Mane & Lil Uzi Vert]
Hah, it's Gucci... Uzi!
DP on the beat!
If I do not reach my goal
If I do not reach my goal

[Hook: Gucci Mane & Lil Uzi Vert]
You just fucked with Gucci Mane, bitch it's your lucky day
I just bought a Rolls but the Ferrari on the way
If you ain't talkin' bout a M then I ain't got none to say
I got so many M&Ms they think I'm Dr. Dre
Bitch you just sucked a millionaire so it's your lucky day
Yeah I just bought a Lambo but that Bentley on the way
If you ain't talkin' bout a M then I ain't got none to say
If you ain't gettin' no money nigga then you in the way

[Verse 1: Lil Uzi Vert]
I don't want no friends, I don't want no foes
Now I got my dough, count it my eyes closed
Why you do it like that, cause it's all C-notes
Yeah, bitch I smoke gas I get hella high
Yeah that shit put me in the sky like satellites
I took that nigga bitch so he's a sadder guy
I fucked that nigga bitch so he's a madder guy
She was with you when I called her phone
Now she answered and that show you you do not matter guy
My cousin trappin' that trappin'
I pull these beats now I gotta appetite
That girl told me she only fuck with them girls
Then I pulled out my ice
Okay, now I fucked her now she half a dyke
Diamond like water, I don't need a flashlight
Riding in my Bentley, now I'm swervin' through traffic lights
Countin' a million, boy what all that cappin' like
Yeah, fly first class, don't know what that packin' like
Cop when I drop, in a drop top

[Bridge: Lil Uzi Vert]
Now stop, better listen
Can't nobody nobody fuck with my kitchen
I get hoes and I show it, let you niggas know it
No limit soldier, way I throw my bows up
My new whip looked like glazed, then I did a donut
My new girl she so nuts remind me of my old one

[Verse 2: Lil Uzi Vert]
Bitch I smoke gas I get hella high
Yeah that shit put me in the sky like satellites
I took that nigga bitch so he's sadder guy

[Outro: Lil Uzi Vert]
Can't run from us
Can't run from us
Can't run from us
If I do not reach my goal
If I do not reach my goal
