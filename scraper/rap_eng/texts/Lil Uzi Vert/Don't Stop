[Hook]
Don't stop, don't stop
Don't stop, don't stop
Bitch, don't stop, don't stop
Don't stop, don't stop
My nigga, my nigga
Lil uzi, lil uzi, lil uzi bitch
My nigga, my nigga
Lil uzi, lil uzi, lil uzi lil uzi
Suck a dick, suck a dick, suck a dick, suck a dick, hoe

[Verse]
Sip rose with my nigga will cause my life is amazin'
And even if I touch 60 mil, paperweight I'm still chasin'
Ain't nothin' like the higher power, 3rd eye but first placin'
And I talk about havin' thoughts about havin' 3 sons with mixed asians
I feel like uncle lou bitch, don't stop
And if she throw it at me, I won't stop I'll just hit it
There's a lot of shit I miss, but being broke; don't miss it
And if it look like a duck and it quack like a duck, nigga don't kiss it
Money what you love nigga? then go get it
Codeine what I love boy, I slow sip it
Tryna get out your contrary, gettin' 460
And it's funny cause the sluts want my money so they all say they all miss me, damn
Real shit, real shit
And it's funny cause the sluts want the money so they all say they all miss me, damn
Fuck a bitch, fuck a thot
And it's funny cause the sluts want the--and they they all say they-
You get it

[Hook]
Don't stop, don't stop
Pop that pussy
Don't stop, don't stop
Bitch, don't stop, don't stop
Don't stop, don't stop
Don't stop, don't stop
My nigga, my nigga
Young god, lil vert
Lil uzi bitch
Suck a dick, suck a dick, suck a dick, suck a dick, hoe
