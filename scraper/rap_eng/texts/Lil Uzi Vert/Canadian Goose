[Verse 1]
I woke up in the morning, brush my teeth smack my bitch ass
All I do is think about the cash
Yeah, what, getting all this cash
Yeah, what, I'm 200 on this dash
Lil Uzi ooh, I got hella groupies
Smoking Backwoods I don't fuck with doobies
Copped the double plus cause I'm rockin' Ksubi's
I fuck with my same hoes I don't trust these newbies
990 that's the New Bs ya
Smoked that boy like he is a loosie ya
On the xan hear a noise I load it up

[Hook]
All these diamonds ain't nobody cold as us
Literally I'm cold as fuck
I need Canadian Goose
I need to get a Moncler
Diamonds so cold need some soup

[Verse 2]
Driving around in a what
Saint Laurent all on my boots
Saint Laurent all on my boo
2,000 dollar a tooth
Lil Uzi you is the truth
Lil Uzi you is the truth
If you think they took my chain, boy you is a fool
I said boy you a fool
I just caught me a Mewtwo
I just caught me a Mewtwo (I choose you!)
Japanese girls stuck to me just like some glue

[Hook]
All these diamonds ain't nobody cold as us
Literally I'm cold as fuck
I need Canadian Goose
I need to get a Moncler
Diamonds so cold need some soup

[Verse 3]
Diamonds all on my teeth so I barely can talk
Money all in my pockets so I barely can walk
Diamonds they shine in the dark
She from LA but she live in New York
But I ain't worried about that
Worried about busting them straps
Lil Uzi ya you know I be smoking that pack
If she gon leave then you know she coming right back
In a Cadillac do a drive by with a mac
When I walk in none of these hoes can relax
When I walk in know that I move with the racks
When I walk in know that I move with the racks
Came right in put my city on my back
But I'm still so relaxed on a xanax
I don't care what you did, don't love you less
But its still Margiela all on my vest
Water cross on my neck
I just flew to the A
I might go to MIA
I ain't talking paper planes
On the block with all my chains
Got the money and the fame
You a lame that's a shame

[Hook]
All these diamonds ain't nobody cold as us
Literally I'm cold as fuck
I need Canadian Goose
I need to get a Moncler
Diamonds so cold need some soup
