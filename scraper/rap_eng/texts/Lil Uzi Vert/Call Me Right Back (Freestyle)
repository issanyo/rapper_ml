[Intro]
Tell me not to call you then you call me right back
Say you trust me but peep when you're fallin' back
Tell me not to call you then you call me right back
Call me right back
You tell me not to call you then you call me right back
Say you trust me but peep when you're fallin' back
If we ever fell out of love we fall back
Even though in this world I never saw that

[Verse 1]
All the things I do for her
All the things she do for trust
Then again she do for us
Started off with just some lust
Then again it was a must
Even though we fight and fuss
Buy diamonds then we hug
Face down that's how I fuck
