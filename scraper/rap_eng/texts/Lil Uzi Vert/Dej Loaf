[Intro]
I-I ain't never been there
I think I'ma take a trip to Detroit

[Hook]
Ran through two bottles, Belaire
I ain't got no time to just toast
Might hit your girl from the rear
Matter fact I want that throat
Everything I got on rare
It come my way off the boat
No I do not know that girl
But I'm in love with Dej Loaf
Somebody bring me Dej Loaf
Somebody bring me Dej Loaf
I gotta find me Dej Loaf
I am in love with um, Dej Loaf
Somebody bring me Dej Loaf
Somebody bring me Dej Loaf
I gotta find me Dej Loaf
I am in love with Dej Loaf

But Imma get straight to the point
I wanna be in her world, Lil Uzi collecting coins
