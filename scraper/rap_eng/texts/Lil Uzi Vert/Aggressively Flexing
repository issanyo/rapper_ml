Lyrics from Snippet

... no I'm [?]
Your momma got her [?], sorry man that's a bless
My new girl got sections on sections on sections
He spent all his money tryin' to put on his diamond necklace
That glocky beside me like I'm in the west
And we use that protection don't use Smith & Wesson
You ainâ€™t really on the block
Boy you really need to stop
I call it love, my girl love call it blessing
I'm bad like a demon, I'm fresh like a reverend
...
