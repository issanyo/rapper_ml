Lyrics from Snippet

[Intro]
Woah, let’s go
Turn up, let's go

[Chorus]
Pour me numb, tell her, "Pour me numb" (pour me numb)
Pour me numb, tell her, "Pour me numb" (pour me numb)
Pour me numb, tell her, "Pour me numb" (pour me numb)
Pour me numb, tell her, "Pour me numb" (pour me numb)

[Verse 1]
Put me numb (oh yeah)
I get so geeked up until I’m dumb (I'm out)
Fuck your girl one time and now she sprung (she stuck)
Know she didn’t mean to fall in love (fall in love)
Ridin’ on this Superleggera, I got her drunk (woah)
Baby, I got something for your tongue (for your tongue)
Rockstar lifestyle, but I swear I am no punk (yeah)
Ayy, someone swear I should be model (yeah)
No, this not no Ferragamo (let's go)
Balenciaga on my collar (huh?)
Just watch the way the money pile up (pile up)
You know everyone know I am your father (your father)
I told that girl her boyfriend childish
Look like Angelica, go walk with the toddlers (walk with the)
She gave me head, graduated from Howard
Smoke 41, graduated from sour (yeah)
My crib so big, compare it to a tower
Don't care if you stink, you cannot um use my shower (no)
No, no, no, you cannot sit on my couch
You need to get some Dove and need to get some dial (facts)
You say you a dog, Courage like you Coward
Red spikes on my Louboutins, like my name Bowser

[Chorus]
Pour me numb, tell her, "Pour me numb"
Pour me numb, tell her, "Pour me numb," let's go
Pour me numb, tell her, "Pour me numb"
What's a choppa if it ain't got a drum?

[Verse 2]
I was the man before I could even tell, shhh
I ain't even know it, shh
I caught pneumonia all on my neck (ok), shhh
All my chains still snowin' (snowin')
You cannot take it, boy, you better show it (show it)
You know you can't hold it (huh?)
If you better hold it then you better blow it (blow it)
No, don't reload it (grra)
And I just
Empty that clip on that fuck nigga
Yeah, that boy just really want war (war)
We playin' the backyard
We use that entrance like it is the front door (woah)
I'm sippin' my Hi
You know that this shit right here, it got me slumped up
Woah, I put that girl right on your tuck, yo
I put that shit in her gut, yeah
Slime, yeah, baby
You know that that lil' nigga, he is so cutthroat (slatt)
You know I'm pescatarian
Them chickens, the fatties get plucked, yo
Woah, hit that bitch, she wanna buck, yo
I make that bih wanna knuck, yo
Yeah, she said she do it for fun
She said that shit make her numb (Uzi)
Pour me numb (woah, woah, woah, woah, skrrt, skrrt, yeah, she said)
Pour me numb (why?)

[Chorus]
Pour me numb, tell her, "Pour me numb" (pour me numb)
Pour me numb, tell her, "Pour me numb" (pour me numb)
Pour me numb, tell her, "Pour me numb" (pour me numb)
Pour me numb, tell her, "Pour me numb" (pour me numb), yeah
Pour me numb, tell her, "Pour me numb" (what that do?), yeah
Pour me numb, tell her, "Pour me numb", yeah, ayy
