[Intro: Leak]
"Yo DJ Day-Day, you a fool for this one, man"

[Chorus]
Yeah
Took four Xanny bars I ain't remember nothin'
The .45 ain't for show, nigga get to bussin'
Talk about me and the repercussions
On the real nigga I swear they comin'
Repercussions, repercussions
Took four Xanny bars I ain't remember nothin'
Repercussions, repercussions
Took four Xanny bars I ain't remember nothin'

[Verse]
Aye, Show me the [?]
We gon' get the sucker (we gon' get the sucker)
That nigga said that we related but that is my sister cousin (that is my sister cuz')
The red beam the green beam the blue beam, ain't missing nothin' (we ain't missing nothin')
Found out that my girl loves it hard, these bitches dusty (I swear to God these bitches is dusty)
'Till Death on they chest and I knew they might lack
Like damn, I'm lucky (Goddamn I'm lucky)
She beggin' to get back with me, 'cause now she see the money (turn up, turn up)
Now she caught her confession, she burning God down like she feel like Usher (feel like she Usher, oh Lord)
It's Friday, I'm stuck in the Rush Hour
Money Talk, feel like Chris Tucker (I feel like Chris Tucker)

[Chorus]
Took four Xanny bars I ain't remember nothin'
The fourth for every show, need to get to bustin'
Talk about me and the repercussions
On the real nigga I swear they comin'
Repercussions, repercussions
Took four Xanny bars I ain't remember nothin'
Repercussions, repercussions
Took four Xanny bars I ain't remember nothin'
