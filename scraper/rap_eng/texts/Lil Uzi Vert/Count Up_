Lyrics from Snippet

[Intro: Chief Keef]
Yo Pi'erre, you wanna come out here?
Now my trunk up, that's two times two
Man, this shit dug in [?] times two
Yeah, my eyes red but [?]
If you gon' run it up, that's all on you

[Verse 1: Lil Uzi Vert]
You know I'm ballin', usual like Kobe (24) ooh
Ain't worried 'bout a hater, they don't know me
He say that he tough, then that boy gotta show me
Pull up, Bentley truck, extra poles, yeah, we four deep (Deep)
Say my name 3 times like I'm Tony (Tony! Toni! Toné!)
Diamond VVS, I put baguettes all on my Rollie
I never believe nothing that you told me
These niggas keep sneak dissing, they turned me to my old me
Before I had these mills, I was oh so lonely
Really really think that diamond [?] my 40
I ain’t never been a phony (No way)
You be gettin' bands? Hardly (Yeah)
I just fucked your bitch, sorry (I'm sorry)
Man, I put that on my shordy (Yah)
Fight me wanna escape, sorry (Let's go)
No, I ain't here for no games, Atari (No way)
Diamonds they hit like water ooh, starbeam, yeah (Phew, phew)
Rockstar life be callin', be callin', let's go (Yeah)
Don't want that girl she stallin', she stallin' (No way)
Bigger foreign whip, ooh, I can't park it (No way)
I'm from outer space, ooh, in a star ship (Yah)
This old foreign bitch, ooh, that's my target (Hello)
Ten bands, what you say? Ooh
Ten bands, for my Chanel carpet
Rocks all over my watch [?]
Y'all niggas slick like margarine
Lost your bitch in Starlet's (Starlet's)

[Chrorus: Lil Uzi Vert]

Woke up with me, do real 160
That girl right at me, got real big titties
What’s in my jeans? Them real big fifties
Fight after fight, hittin' real big cities
From the same boss, yeah, my brothers is with me
They give me the dime, I'm comin' to get me

Cut rug right with me, up fill the hemi [?]
