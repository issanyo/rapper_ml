[Intro: Lil Uzi]
I just was telling Keisha
Like, imma have dolphins and shit in my crib

[Verse 1: Lil Uzi]
Waking up living life with no outcome
Fucked that bitch outside gave her out cum
By any means just like Malcolm
Live by any means just like Malcolm
I be outside all the way from the morning to dark
All these diamonds in my teeth, yeah I barely can talk
I be balling like I am Derrick Rose
Killing my competition like I'm Rogue
Luv is rage I'm in the crowd at my shows

[Hook: Lil Uzi]
I just want all of my niggas to ball
I just want all of my niggas to see, all the shit that I might not get to see
I just want all of my niggas to eat, I might just pull out that lean
That's a four
I might just jump in a Rari with two doors, I might just pull up and fuck on two hoes
I might just pull up and stunt like a boss
I spent seven thousand right on the coat
On the real I don't know how to spell broke
If she talk too much I put dick in her throat
I be balling like I am Derrick Rose
Killing my competition like I'm Rogue
Luv is rage I'm in the crowd at my shows

[Verse 2: Lil Uzi]
Counting money till I'm blue in the face
Counting money and they blue in the face, I fucked that bitch till she blue in the face
Wearing Balmain, extra skinny, skinny, skinny all the way till I'm blue in the waist
Mixing lean, everywhere soda
Unlike my heart, my cup way colder, xanny bars got me way bolder
I just be counting the bank, I ball like I am Durant
Your bitch I swear she a fan, I put that money on you yeah
Little nigga you will get fanned, living life like I'm a rock star
I do this shit for my fans, my brother he is a block star
He amazing with the pans

[Hook: Lil Uzi]
I just want all of my niggas to ball
I just want all of my niggas to see, all the shit that I might not get to see
I just want all of my niggas to eat, I might just pull out that lean, that's a four
I might just jump in a Rari with two doors, I might just pull up and fuck on two hoes
I might just pull up and stunt like a boss
I spent seven thousand right on the coat
On the real I don't know how to spell broke
If she talk too much I put dick in her throat
I be balling like I am Derrick Rose
Killing my competition like I'm Rogue
Luv is rage I'm in the crowd at my shows

[Verse 3: Lil Uzi]
Paid a lot of money for this ice
On the real I think I found my wife
Always in my hair just like some lice, when I miss a call you know I hit her twice
Put it on my life, higher than a kite
Living life like I can't die, they live for me and that's the reason why

[Hook: Lil Uzi]
I just want all of my niggas to ball
I just want all of my niggas to see, all the shit that I might not get to see
I just want all of my niggas to eat, I might just pull out that lean
And just fall
I might just jump in a Rari with two doors, I might just pull up and fuck on two hoes
I might just pull up and stunt like a boss
I spent seven thousand right on the coat
On the real I don't know how to spell broke
If she talk too much I put dick in her throat
I be balling like I am Derrick Rose
Killing my competition like I'm Rogue
Luv is rage I'm in the crowd at my shows
