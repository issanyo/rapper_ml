[Hook]
I just don't want you for the night
Baby I want you for the rest of my life
But why do you make us cry
Yeah can we stop wasting time
Push me to the edge
Alcohol and drugs ill get
Push me to the edge
Alcohol and drugs ill get
Push me to the edge

Push me to the edge

[Sinneyy - Verse 1]
and I'm here for you,So why you keep lying now?
you think I don't know what you do but I know somehow
and im trying,and im trying,Im trying everyday
but every time I try it gets pushed back in my face
I leave my place and  go and see my mates
but they got their girls with their problems that they face
I prefer being on my own,its better to be alone
Wanna get my life back i wanna take back my throne
I need get my courage
Lose the ounce,lose some pounds
I thank my friends for the support im going though right now
Anytime,any place,just ring my number im here on call now
Most of my friends are dead
no trust,no respect
Real friends here in the end
Me and my Girl will make amends

In the club they got no 1s we were baked now
Clothes from overseas, got the racks and they all C-Notes, you is not a G though
Look at you stackinâ€™ all your money, it all green though
