[Chorus: Lil Uzi Vert]
I be on the moon, by myself
They say that they real but I can't tell
That's why I got this Glocky by my belt
If you try to stop me, won't end well
I be on the moon, by myself
They say that they real but I can't tell
That's why I got this Glocky by my belt
If you try to stop me, won't end well

[Verse 1: NAV]
