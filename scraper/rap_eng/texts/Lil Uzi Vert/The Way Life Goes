[Pre-Chorus]
That's true, that's right
She's sipping Moet, and yeah I swear it gets her wetter
My Louboutins new, so my bottoms, they is redder
No I'm not a rat but I'm all about my cheddar
Just talked to your homie she said we should be together
Gave me brain, was so insane that I made her my header
If she ever call my phone you know I gotta dead her
But I like that girl too much, I wish I never met her
Hello I was listening to this song
It goes like

[Chorus]
I know it hurts sometimes but you'll get over it
You'll find another life to live
I swear that you'll get over it
I know you're sad and tired
You've got nothing left to give
You'll find another life to live
I know that you'll get over it

[Verse 1]
Wish I never ever ever told you things
I was only only trying to show you things
Iced out heart on your neck trying to froze your ring
I had to get me a new bitch to hold the pain
We was in Hawaii looking at the rain
She smiling happy but I'm laughing 'cause her new man a lame
(Broke boi, broke boi, broke boi, broke boi)
That just goes to show me money don't attract a thing (real shit)
Stuck to the plan even though you used to go with my mans
Oh get over it

[Chorus]
I know it hurts sometimes but you'll get over it
You'll find another life to live
I swear that you'll get over it
I know you're sad and tired
You've got nothing left to give
You'll find another life to live
I know that you'll get over it

[Verse 2]
I tied up my RAF you strapped up your Rick
Diamonds on your neck, ice all on my wrist
Complement my style
She don't want me I'm running wild
You know I respect her on that level
She don't want me then I'ma let her
Go over there with that broke fella
Walk off my Saint Laurent, that leather
My new chick I swear that she better
Want me back, never (ooh)

[Pre-Chorus]
That's true, that's right
She's sipping Moet, and yeah I swear it gets her wetter
My Louboutins new, so my bottoms, they is redder
No I'm not a rat but I'm all about my cheddar
Just talked to your homie she said we should be together
Gave me brain, was so insane that I made her my header
If she ever call my phone you know I gotta dead her
But I like that girl too much, I wish I never met her

[Chorus: Oh Wonder & Lil Uzi Vert]
I know it hurts sometimes but you'll get over it (woah)
You'll find another life to live
I swear that you'll get over it (you'll get over it)
I know it hurts sometimes but you'll get over it (no,no)
You'll find another life to live (you will)
I know that you'll get over it (oh)

[Outro: Oh Wonder & Lil Uzi Vert]
You'll get over it
You'll get over it
You'll get over it
You'll get over it
That's true, that's right
She's sipping Moet, and yeah I swear it gets her wetter
My Louboutins new, so my bottoms, they is redder
No I'm not a rat but I'm all about my cheddar
Just talked to your homie she said we should be together
Gave me brain, was so insane that I made her my header
If she ever call my phone you know I gotta dead her
But I like that girl too much, I wish I never met her
