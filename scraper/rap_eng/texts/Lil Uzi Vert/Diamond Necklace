[Verse 1: Lil Uzi Vert]
Comma comma comma to comma
I ain't got time for none of your comments
Look at me, brand new with the swag
Look at you all your shit lookin' sour
Diamonds on me they be shinin' on rollie
Rollie pollie to the motherfuckin' ollie
22 I'mma just ? your ass slow
Get back, get back slowly
Might jump in the Lotus
.45 it jump out the holster
Took your bitch right on that moolah bed
Just like I'm Dino Spumoni
Ginuwine, Ginuwine when on a hoe
Make her just ride on the pony
I am your daddy I'm fuckin' your momma
You look at me, you look like Jodie

[Hook: Lil Uzi Vert]
Diamond Neck-a-Lace aye
Diamonds on my fist
Please excuse my wrist, please excuse my bitch aye
Lambo with the tint aye
Chopper with the grip aye
Rockstar Fashion sense aye
Hater slit my drip aye
Aye Grab the pot then I turn my wrist
Oh my god I think I sprained my wrist
Aye diamonds on it now I flood my wrist
Aye diamonds on it now I flood my wrist aye

[Verse 2: William Aston]
I'mma keep it G if you a hater see you later
I won't even text you back if it ain't bout the paper
I need a crib I can't even see my neighbors (100 acres)
I need a crib I can't see my neighbors
I just fucked two hoes and kicked they ass outta the crib
Cause them bitches know how to act
Vert in the kitchen he whippin and whippin'
I'm smokin' some loud and he's sippin some act
Hair lookin' crazy they tellin' me I need a haircut
And I'm just like woadie relax
Gettin' them stacks countin' them stacks
All while I'm fuckin' your bitch from the back
Bankroll slippin out the pockets
But you ain't got nothing to do with that
It's still Monclaire, I don't even care
Rollie, you other niggas new to that

[Hook: Lil Uzi Vert]

Aye diamonds on me now I fill my wrist
Aye diamonds on me now I fill my wrist
