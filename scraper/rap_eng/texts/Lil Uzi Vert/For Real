[Intro]
Damn, DJ Plugg, you just killed it
Bobby Kritical

[Verse 1]
For real, for real, for real, yuh
Sleep on 'em, that's Tempur-Pedic
Get the green like it's kale, pockets they fat just like Kenan
Told her I love her, ain't mean it
That's because her head the meanest
You heard that I am from Mars
I heard that you was from Venus
I met that bitch in a meeting
I fucked that bitch from the meeting
I been was planning to leave her
So I just left it to Jesus
Yuh, yuh, yuh, yuh, yuh
Lil Vert like Gerald (gang)
Told that girl to cheer up
Fucking that girl 'til she tear up
Heard you fucked her, she embarrassed
Heard your whip Gary Barbara (eww)
Wait, for real? For real? For real?
Diamonds they wet like a seal
Diamonds wet like Navy Seal
Heard you drink lean, crack the seal
Everybody know it ain't real

[Chorus]
You know I kept it for real
Walk around with it for real
You wanna bet if my money for real
For real? For real
All of my diamonds for real
Different color like Pharrell's
Yeah, that's for real
For real, for real
You know I kept it for real
Walk around with it for real
You wanna bet if my money for real
For real? For real
All of my diamonds for real
Different color like Pharrell's
Yeah, that's for real
For real, for real

[Verse 2]
Won't say no names but my niggas, they pulled up
You niggas talk too much, get your mouth sewed up
Look at my chain, throwin' salt 'cause it's snowing
Vivienne West but my fur lookin' polar
My Gosha from Dover, I drive in the Rover
Homie don't know me, don't get in my moment
All that sneak dissing, don't think that I ain't noticed
I lift my door and I forgot to close it
Boy better keep it sealed
Fuck around, get killed
Fuck around, get drilled
Cut your hands if you steal
Whip it up like a meal
I just made me a mill'
Money jumping out my pocket
Tucking bands in my belt
Stop calling my phone, leave me alone
I'm on TV with the VVs so I 3-D'd my stones
We really don't get along
She anemic, I'm more chill
Had to keep this shit for real
All the way to the beat build, yeah

[Chorus]
You know I kept it for real
Walk around with it for real
You wanna bet if my money for real
For real? For real
All of my diamonds for real
Different color like Pharrell's
Yeah, that's for real
For real, for real
You know I kept it for real
Walk around with it for real
You wanna bet if my money for real
For real? For real
All of my diamonds for real
Different color like Pharrell's
Yeah, that's for real
For real, for real
