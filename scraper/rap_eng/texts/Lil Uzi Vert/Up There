[Intro: Lil Uzi Vert]
Triple-Six Mafia
Triple-Six Mafia
Triple-Six Mafia
Triple-Six Mafia

[Chorus: Juicy J & (Lil Uzi Vert)]
My check, my sack, it's up there
I'm lit, I'm high, I'm up there
A hunnit shots, I'm up there
I'm on the charts, I'm up there
She get on top, she up there
On top of the game, I'm up there
They look up to me, I'm up there
Just Like Mike, I'm up there (Triple-Six)
I just put my bitch up on a flight
She gucci up there
Prices high, they up there
Don't go, you ain't from up there
I'm sitting on fours, I'm up there
Toot that ass up there
We playing catch with the money
Throw your stash up there
(Triple-Six)

[Verse 1: Juicy J]
Bitch, it cost to be the boss
And I should know, I'm up there
Just bought a watch
Might as well buy a chain since I'm up here
Yeah, I got gang up here
So you can't hang up here
These hoes be choosers so don't bring your main thang up here
Look like I play ball, bitch
My net worth is way up there
I'm making the calls like a ref
I'm officially up there
Thought you was taking off this year, but you ain't going nowhere
I swear I'm on these niggas neck
When they look up, I'm up there

[Chorus: Juicy J & (Lil Uzi Vert)]
(Triple-Six)
My check, my sack, it's up there
I'm lit, I'm high, I'm up there
A hunnit shots, I'm up there
I'm on a charts, I'm up there
She get on top, she up there
On top of the game, I'm up there
They look up to me, I'm up there
Just Like Mike, I'm up there (Triple-Six)
I just put my bitch up on a flight
She gucci up there
Prices high, they up there
Don't go, you ain't from up there
I'm sitting on fours, I'm up there
Toot that ass up there
We playing catch with the money
Throw your stash up there
(Triple-Six)

[Verse 2: YKOM]
Shit's so insane, I'm up there
They frown on my dame, it's monclair
They lost in the brain, I don't entertain
They ain't got no hane, they stuck there
Them dope flows make your betty rock
I came in with the devil push
These songs never really touch down
The number ones got me up there
Friends coast on the bag
Soon as I sit in the jag, I'm up there
They only watch you make 'em mad
30k for the tag, it's up there
Shopping sprees, never lack
250 on the bag, doing the math
Every time I get an 88, that's 100 in the stash
