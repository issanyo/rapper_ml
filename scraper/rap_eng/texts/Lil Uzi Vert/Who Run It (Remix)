[Intro: G Herbo]
Southside on the track, yeah
Gang shit, nigga
Yeah
Fuck you talkin' 'bout, man?
This shit's got the most views out of everything I've ever put up on my shit
That little clip, that shit got a million views
I ain't never got no views on some shit out

[Verse 1: G Herbo]
Who you think you ahead of? Not us
In the S or the Porsche Carerras somethin'
Fuck twins like Tia and Tamera somethin'
Yeah that boy gettin' bread, Panera, somethin'
Landed in the GT, leer or somethin'
Put Posto in the Air or somethin'
Marry her, she have an affair
I'ma spin that ho like Ferris
Born in the Chi like Ye
But I do crimes like Bump J, I ain't scared of nothin'
Passport stamp, young nigga ran up that sack
Might as well go to Paris, huh?
Woofin, got whacked you embarrassed, huh?
Pussy you act like you scared of somethin'
Gon' and shoot up the terrorists (shoot up the terrorists)
Then they gon' realize it's serious (blah, blah)
I ain't even on that, period (period)
I'm makin' millions, I'm serious (I'm makin' millions)
That money come in various (furious)
Can't count it, I get delirious (delirious)
I bought my mama a mansion (a mansion)
So I can't trip over materials (yeah, yeah)
But I'm still dipped in that fashion
Know I stay drippin', that's period
These niggas drippin', that's period
Nah, they can't find me and I'm serious (serious)
They right behind, I'm serious (serious)
And I'm straight off the 9, now I'm serious
Who you gon' send to fuck with me?
Take stuff from me or from any of mine? Now I'm curious (I'm curious)
Better think 'fore you bust at me
If you miss, I'll slap a 50 and, man, now I'm furious
Dived in that water, dived like Aquarius
Young nigga, we was breakin' the barriers (breakin' the barriers)
If you grabbin' that torch, better carry it (better carry it)
Tryna hide on that porch on some scary shit (fuck yeah)

[Verse 2: G Herbo]
All I smoke is loud, you got that mild like Darius (yeah)
My son ain't gotta work because he gon' inherit it, uh huh (gon' inherit it)
We yell, "Gang-gang first," you don't even know your heritage (bitch)
Took the cash from verses, I give that shit to charity
Lovin' my city like Chano, I swear
Why the fuck I still gotta ride everywhere with it?
"Herb I seen you on the news, I was worried"
We was just jokin' with y'all, that's a parody
We don't talk too much, got D's everywhere (everywhere)
We still fresh, double G's everywhere (everywhere)
I put the VV's everywhere (everywhere)
I do Mike Amiri's, every pair
And they know me for shittin' on everybody
I'm the one that do shit that you hear about
I'm the one that told y'all that I move like Obama
Then how the fuck they end up with my whereabouts?
Hold on everybody gotta clear it out
Middle of summer, hot like a sauna
We was laid back in the back of the Honda
Told young to sneak up, anaconda
It ain't happen, not one day, your honor
I was somewhere eatin' Benihana's
Get valet and Lil' Benny to park it
All my life I had been in apartments
Move to Bali, get a brib, Iâ€™m ballin
My bitch always primpin', keep ballin'
Yes I'm a lil' workaholic
Hit the crib with a 50 and all 20's
I'ma just make her count all of 'em
But I get the backend all blues
Nah don't fuck around, bruh, do all of it
Know it's goin' right to lil' dude
Already got a closet, all shoes
Bought 10 pairs of baby G-Fazos
And my bitch got a closet with some Loubs
Cashed out on the crib, I ain't get the view
I'm like, "Fuck it, no problem, it'll do"
Mama's crib got a pond, not a pool
We had roaches and rats, I ain't get to move
I survived through it all, it's true (yes, it's true)
Slept on couches and floors all through middle school
Now I'm cool, now I'm 'bool
Now my car go vroom, (vroom)
Niggas hatin' on me, but it's bool
Guess I got rich too soon
Nigga, I've been rappin' like six years (what?)
I seen ten niggas get killed
What about me turnin' down them deals? (Huh)
Now you pissed off 'cause I switched wheels?

[Interlude: G Herbo]
Uh, who run it? Limit
No Limit run it
No Limit man
No Limit
Who run it? G Herbo
I'm done with this shit

[Verse 3: Lil Uzi Vert]
Who y'all think you foolin'? Not me
Y'all niggas really ain't airin' nothin'
This bust down, tryna scare us or some'
Your shit weak, tryna compare us or somethin'
What I made last week? Like a million or somethin'
Rich, mad 'cause your bitch ate my kids or somethin'
Man, I could fuck your wife like you sharin' or somethin'
Galore ass mansion with lira or somethin'
Nigga tried to get my ho, tried to fuck my bitch
You think I'ma miss that?
Man she sucked Meen's dick and she sucked Rock's dick
So you think I'ma kiss that?
I was in L.A., bitch powdered her nose
Told her I ain't with that
Boy you trippin', SI diamonds on your neck
Mean you better give your wrist back
Me no broke, Akademiks, yeah, that's where you get your news at
Ask your bros, Grammy-nominated songs just to prove that
Know your bros told you, nah, you better not just do that, uh
I'm going mode, T.Y., tell me when to go, boy, you ain't rich, you a bitch (facts)
Oh you T'd out? Bitch, you beat out
Y'all worried 'bout me, better get your lick back
Just like bitches, y'all all chit chat
Car so foreign got an engine in the back
Balenciaga with the Gucci and the Prada
With the Louis and the Pucci and it's all mismatched
Ho, it's Lil Uzi and I'm far from a goofy
In Chiraq, 150, be strapped
Got a 40 shorty, boy, better get back
Gun loud, backyard party, kick back
How I'm broke If I just hired myself a hitman?
Be quiet, bro, them niggas over there'll turn to six rats
Not lyin', bro, I been fucked this bitch for six racks
After I drop that shit, me, Herbo, Ari and my bitch is gonna relax
Prolly somewhere on a beach, prolly somewhere on an island
You know that my Rollie got XO diamonds in it, so that's that Perfect Timing
Said, "Elliot, bezel it," ice kettle chips, I run it back like a Heisman
Pull up, I'm swervin', I'm mergin', I got the whip, yeah the one right with the curtains
Got boys that be workin' their block to be twerkin', the Tesla pull up for diversion
On the beat, me and Herbo, we purgin', the Perky the molly the lean got us slurrin'
You call her phone, you think she sleep, but she suckin' my dick while her words keep on slurpin'
She said that my shit the same size as a two-liter ginger ale, why she keep burpin'
I take out my hair and I stand on my money, your bitch think I'm Julius Erving

[Outro: Lil Uzi Vert]
Ayy, ayy
Yeah, yeah
Just a little somethin' to it, I ain't even rip the shit
Pull up in a Lamb' or somethin'
Peanut butter whip, yeah, jam or somethin'
Fucked your bitch on cam or somethin'
Pink diamonds think I'm Cam or somethin'
