Bitch I feel like I'm dancing on a tight rope
Money it be dancing just like Michael, I said
All these diamonds they be dancing like Michael
Hit a nigga with the chopper me and savage psycho

[Man Man Savage]
Got the chopper hanging out the fuckin' windows
Uzi got that Uzi hanging out the window
We ain't playing games nigga no nintendo
They be strapped you know we got extendos
K got an extension, hundred rounds in it
Money comin' in you know I'm gettin' chicken
All these niggas chicken, pull up at they spot
See what they been gettin', extortion the plot
When I'm in the kitchen, bitch I scrape the pot

[Lil Uzi Vert]
Chopper beam it missing
Whole block in my locks
That bitch I'm [?]
Kitchen flippin' chickens
Went to rags to riches aye
Rollie time it tickin'
And the foreign whippin' three bitches
Like a limo date
On the interstate, bitch I'm switchin' lanes
My bitch sniff cocaine, I'm just on the lean
I don't rock no Jo Jo's, rock nothing but Balmain

Bitch I feel like I'm dancing on a tight rope

[Lil Uzi Vert]
Rockin' a suit with my chopper, I feel like I am just Tony
My bitch she from the islands, but I'm not talking bout kony
My lil bitch she not bony, my nigga wet like a sponce
Put tattoos all on my face, cause I just live in the moment
Yeah pockets always swollen, I be on my lonely

[man man savage]
Chopper by my lonely
Man these niggas phony
[?] be from sony
Wet it in the morning, I ain't even want it
Feelin' like I'm Michael
Beat it like I'm Michael
Money every day i swear this shit a cycle
If you scared nigga go to church, read a bible
I'm the shit
