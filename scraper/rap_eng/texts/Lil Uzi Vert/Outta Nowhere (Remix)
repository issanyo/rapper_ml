[Hook: Lil Uzi Vert]
Yeah, came outta nowhere, they ain't notice me
Yah, got my bandz up, yah, now they notice me
Yah, diamonds on my neck, yah, you ain't cold as me
Yah, granddad money, yah, money old as me
Yeah, came outta nowhere, they ain't notice me
Yah, got my bandz up, yah, now they notice me
Yah, diamonds on my neck, yah, you ain't cold as me
Yah, granddad money, yah, money old as me

[Verse 1: Lil Uzi Vert]
Passin' that bitch, I recycle that bitch and I fuck her again
Yah, stackin' my money, payback on my money, I go for the win
Yah, gettin' my money, got [?] for the hundred
Put dick in her tummy, that bitch all up on me
Put dick in her throat, make that bitch wanna vomit
Doin' the most, seven thousand my coat
That drum on my gun and that bitch not a Tommy
I might catch a homi right over this hottie
She got that whoadie, I fuck that bitch on my bed, she leave my sheets on the side
She know I'm black, but she look me in my eye and that lil' bitch call me papi
You left the store, but they would not [?] a minute, the only nigga wanna top me
Told that lil' bitch that I stopped goin' to the gym cause my pockets so stocky
Thumbin' and fuckin', thumbin' and thumbin' and fuckin', you ain't even know that be my hobby
Put dick in that girl, she got that turkey, I beat up the stuffing
Hold up, shh, change the subject if you know it ain't really bout the money
