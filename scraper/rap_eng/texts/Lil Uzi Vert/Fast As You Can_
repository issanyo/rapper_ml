Lyrics from Snippet

[Verse]
Yeah
I don't wanna throw these bands
Know that she will drop it low, when she do her dance
Turn around, girl (yeah) on a handstand
I don't really want her, but I'm 'bout to throw these bands
I don't really want her, but I'm 'bout to throw these bands
You took your girl out to eat, she wanna get a tan
So I swooped in first, I see you took her to the sand, yeah
I donâ€™t really want her, but I'm 'bout to throw these bands (yeah)
All jump in a Lamb
Move that car fast (yeah), fast as I can
[?], fast as you can
Fast as you can, fast as you can
Told that girl drop it low, fast as you can
Fast as you can (yeah), fast as you can
