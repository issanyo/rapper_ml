DP on the beat
{Verse 1}
(Lil uzi)
Yea! I woke up {?}
I got post up look at my neck diamond choker
Girl you got scared of me{?} and she a little bit older
Count my bands then I’m hitting my shoulder
Drive in a lamb not a lotus( huh, what?)
(?) I cannot hit it you know it cause you is a fan and you know it
But just in case wanna  know it , if I hit it you get to moaning
Hit it from night from the morning {?} I’m still right in my moment

{Hook}
Counting up my bands
{?} ain’t no random
Don’t trap off no iPhone they can’t tap my Samsung(Um yea)
