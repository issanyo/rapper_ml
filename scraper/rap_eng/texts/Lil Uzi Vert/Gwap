[Hook]
Guap nigga, thats what I'm gettin'
I hear these  snakes nigga they be hissin'
Guap nigga, thats what I'm gettin'
I hear the snakes they be hissin'
I can't fuck with no bitch niggas
And I don't do well with sneak dissin'
Guap nigga, thats what I'm gettin'
I hear these  snakes nigga they be hissin'
Guap nigga, thats what I'm gettin'
I hear the snakes they be hissin'
I can't fuck with no bitch niggas
And I don't do well with sneak dissin'

[Verse 1]
Woke up this morning went straight to the kitchen
I'm whippin' and whippin', that act got me sippin'
That perc got me itchin', Xanax got me trippin'
I'm bustin' the Smith and these niggas start drippin'
Better hope that I'm missin', I take your existence
My dick what she grippin', my pockets they drippin'
That bitch think I'm trippin'
Tilapia Fish with strippers they dinners and lobster and lemon
Armani, Givenchy, Versace white linens
Finessin' I'm flexin' I feel like a gymnast
My bank sure like O Dog cuz I am the menace
Slugs on my teeth and a nigga keep grinnin'
Margiela, Rick Owens, that hat be Raf Simons
Its funny my pockets they be money centered
Its funny my pockets they got money in it
I drill in her mouth just like I'm a dentist
Niggas be hatin' bitches be fakin'
Money I'm makin, your bitch I'm takin'
Put work in my [?]
Never your hoe, but  the cake what I'm chasin'
They say I'm a mason, put me next to Satan
But none of this true I'm just gettin' this paper
They say I'm a mason, put me next to Satan
But none against you I'm just gettin' this paper

[Hook]
Guap nigga, thats what I'm gettin'
I hear these  snakes nigga they be hissin'
Guap nigga, thats what I'm gettin'
I hear the snakes they be hissin'
I can't fuck with no bitch niggas
And I don't do well with sneak dissin'
Guap nigga, thats what I'm gettin'
I hear these  snakes nigga they be hissin'
Guap nigga, thats what I'm gettin'
I hear the snakes they be hissin'
I can't fuck with no bitch niggas
And I don't do well with sneak dissin'
