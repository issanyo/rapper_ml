[Pre-Chorus]
Livin' life like a dream
But I don't get no rest
I just got a new girl
But I'm thinkin' who next
Started off in first class
Now I'm jumpin' off a jet
I put diamonds all on your bitch (ayy)
I put diamonds all on my wrist (ayy)

[Chorus]
I put diamonds all on my wrist (ayy)
I put diamonds all on my wrist (ayy)
I put diamonds all on my wrist (ayy)
I put diamonds all on my wrist (ayy)
I put diamonds all on my wrist (ayy)
I put diamonds all on my wrist (ayy)
I put diamonds all on my wrist (ayy)
I put diamonds all on my wrist (ayy)

[Verse 1]
Neck on flood, wrist on flood
Fist on flood, got it out the mud
What up blood, what up cuh'
Don't want her, she a bug
All my jewels they on flood (yeah)
You want war, then let's tug
Tell me bitch what you want (what you want)
Man it is what it was

I don't fuss, you get buss
Got red bottoms, these ain't Chucks
I want her, I want her
I want sister, I want cuz
I'm the type nigga that's slimier than a slug
Roll up on you a two, two three bitch that's the slug
Bitch you done, I'm gon' duh
Your face look like a pug
Made an album in a month
I did that shit off the drugs
I got paid for a walk through, but ain't come to the club
Living room cost ten thousand, and that's just for my rug

[Pre-Chorus]
Livin' life like a dream
But I don't get no rest
I just got a new girl
But I'm thinkin' ooh, next
Started off in first class
Now I'm jumpin' off a jet
I put diamonds all on your bitch (ayy)
I put diamonds all on my wrist (ayy)

[Chorus]
I put diamonds all on my wrist (ayy)
I put diamonds all on my wrist (ayy)
I put diamonds all on my wrist (ayy)
I put diamonds all on my wrist (ayy)
I put diamonds all on my wrist (ayy)
I put diamonds all on my wrist (ayy)
I put diamonds all on my wrist (ayy)
I put diamonds all on my wrist (ayy)

[Verse 2]
Patty cake, patty cake, patty cake
Tell me how much do a nigga make
If I had a hun'ed dollar for a million times
That's how much that a nigga gon' hate
Might fuck your bitch in the center stage
Yeah I put shrimp on my dinner plate
I put gold flakes on my dinner plate
I fucked a snowflake 'cause they into me
Her ass so fat got sit it down
Turn around girl, let me get it now
Nice foreign car, ain't rentin' now
I get the band I won't spend it now
You don't know me
I go overseas and I might get it like ten a pound
Not my homie
If you wanna buy watch the weight I just prefer you now
She wanna fuck all the homie now
Tell that lil' bitch just to simmer down
Automatic on no semi now
Do a back flip like a simmie now
Count it up
Now that fuck nigga can't stand me now
All your clothes they look like hand me downs
Got the glockie you can't jam me now (Yea)

[Pre-Chorus]
Livin' life like a dream
But I don't get no rest
I just got a new girl
But I'm thinkin' ooh, next
Started off in first class
Now I'm jumpin' off a jet
I put diamonds all on your bitch (ayy)
I put diamonds all on my wrist (ayy)

[Chorus]
I put diamonds all on my wrist (ayy)
I put diamonds all on my wrist (ayy)
I put diamonds all on my wrist (ayy)
I put diamonds all on my wrist (ayy)
I put diamonds all on my wrist (ayy)
I put diamonds all on my wrist (ayy)
I put diamonds all on my wrist (ayy)
I put diamonds all on my wrist (ayy)
