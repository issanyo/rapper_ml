Talkin' 'bout a broken heart, runnin' to the restroom

[Verse 1]
Looked at my mama just like we rich
Looked at my bitch like we rich
Said we ain't got no minor setbacks
Countin' all that money, told that nigga just to bet that
I, I know that you ain't got it, boy, why you ain't just say that?
They see I got that money, now his bitch like, "I said that"
