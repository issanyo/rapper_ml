[Verse]
Boy you Hater, Boy you Faker, Boy you [?]

[Verse]
400 dollars for a brand new gucci beanie, whippin up a [?]
Geekin up like LA [?], Yeah i Flex im sorry, I ain't get many

[Verse]
Niggas keep [?] Diamonds on my teeth

[Verse]
Diamond water like a ocean like a lake
Nowadays I get like 80k a show
Now I'm at 50 shows straight from my tour
Run it up, run it up, fuck yo bitch made up

Diamonds all on my toes fucking O's?
