[Verse 1: Lil Uzi Vert]:
Yeah they said I wouldn't make it
Said I couldn't do it
Can't believe I made it
Can't believe I made it like
Can't believe they hated that
[?] up in my face, yeah
I ain't got the time, aye
Imma break the bank
Counting up my bands, yeah I'm the man
Glasses lit up tint, this is no Ray Band
Oh you 36, I super soak your ma'am
Money in my hand, riding in a lamb
Knew I wanted this when I was like 17
Turning it right to my reality

[Verse 2: Marzey]:
Yah
Nigga hating on me cause a nigga go and get it
I be fucking on...
