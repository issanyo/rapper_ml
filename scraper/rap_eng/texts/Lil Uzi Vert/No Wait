[Hook]
Moving that work nigga, I'm gonna shake it
The kitchen I bake in
My plug he Jamaican
My diamonds, they racist
I got tired of waiting
I got tired of waiting
I swear I'm impatient
I got to the weight
I got tired of waiting
I got tired of waiting
I got tired of waiting
I got to the weight
I got tired of waiting
I got tired of waiting
I got tired of waiting
I got to the weight

[Verse 1]
I'm countin' this guap, I'm countin' this cake
I just flew in from LA, then I jumped right in the Wraith
Lil Uzi be gettin' the money, I swear that I'm breakin' the bank
Lil Uzi be gettin' the money, that's why I be crackin' the safe
I'm countin' these hundreds, these hundreds, these hundreds, I'm breakin' the bay
I'm countin' these hundreds, these hundreds, Lil Uzi be crackin' the safe
Yeah, I'm on my way, sippin' that purple and pink
Pints and pints of the lean, pints and pints of the lean
My M16 got a beam, if I let that trigger squeeze
It'll put you in a dream, you know a forever dream
I got the forever cream, I get the forever guap
Pockets got forever knots, cruisin' on forever yachts

[Hook]
Moving that work nigga, I'm gonna shake it
The kitchen I bake in
My plug he Jamaican
My diamonds they racist
I got tired of waiting
I got tired of waiting
I swear I'm inpatient
I got to the weight
I got tired of waiting
I got tired of waiting
I got tired of waiting
I got to the weight
I got tired of waiting
I got tired of waiting
I got tired of waiting
I got to the weight

[Verse 2]
Smokin' strongest ganja, bitch I wasn't waiting
Got the flawless diamonds, bitch I wasn't waiting
I rock all this designer, bitch I wasn't waiting
Fuck your bitch and your momma, nigga wasn't waiting
Pull off like a nigga racin'
Cut that bitch off like I'm Jason
You is behind me so you forever chasin'
In my pocket it is KK
Yeah, I be smokin' that KK
Got them shock bullets in AKs
Swear I go nuts like a payday
Countin' these hundreds, these hundreds, these hundreds, these hundreds, I'm countin' numbers
Look at these diamonds, look-look at these diamonds
Takin' these rap nigga bitches to private islands
Flying first class, building my sky mileage

I got tired of waiting
I got tired of waiting
