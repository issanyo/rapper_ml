[Verse 1: Lil Uzi Vert]
Yeah, trap, cell (Trap), Mac, no Dell (Let's go)
Leave a nigga, stale (Stale), tec, no Kel (Bah!)
One hand, Odell (One hand), slime, snail (Slatt)
Water, well, chain, can't melt (Let's go)
Glocks, in the mail
We send oppositions to hell (We do)
These niggas, they snitches, gon' tell (Let's go)
'Cause there is no hint on my shells (Bah!)

[Chorus: Shabazz]
Shells, shells, shells, shells (Bah!)
Shells, shells, shells, shells (Bah!)
Shells, shells, shells, shells (Bah!)
Shells, shells, shells, shells (Bah!)

[Verse 2: Shabazz]
I keep shells, send his ass to hell
I got bales, I got clientele
Pay you when it land, nigga, I don't trust the mail
Get em' in, get em' gone, they don't touch the scale
Glock 27, got it custom with the rail
Niggas playin', I'ma deal with 'em
AR with a hunnid, I'ma still get 'em'
Walk a nigga down on that wild shit
Bro got molly, sand tan, brown shit
Bo-Boss up for a check, I feel like money man
Hold up, leave the bank, hit the money dance
I'm off percs, I don't fuck with Xans
In-In a sprinter, not a minivan
She fuck with me 'cause I'm a winner, man
Dont fuck with you 'cause you a mini-man
Pakk Boy Gang got choppas like the Taliban
I might work my wrist and serve it hand to hand

[Chorus: Shabazz]
Shells, shells, shells, shells
Shells, shells, shells, shells
Shells, shells, shells, shells
Shells, shells, shells, shells
Shells, shells, shells, shells
Shells, shells, shells, shells
Shells, shells, shells, shells
Shells, shells, shells, shells

[Verse 3: Lil Uzi Vert]
Mask on my face when we run in yo' place
And we need every combination to the safe
And then if you cooperate everyone safe
Got a Spanish bitch and she love giving me face
I said "Little bitch, do you like how this shit tastes?"
She said "Uno, dos, tres, cuatro, cinco, y seis"
Tryna figure out how I'm gon' get out my deal
I'm a bad boy, a reverend, I feel like I'm Ma$e
Your bitch with me but she got leave by 8
'Cause you know Lil Uzi do not walk with no cape
Don't got no Bape but my niggas, they apes
And we walk with bananas that bust at yo' grape
Atlantic, Pacific, and Indian Ocean gon' lay on my neck
Lil' bitch, this not a lake
The slowest car I got is prolly a Hellcat
And if you want do it, we prolly could race (Skrrt)
And if you gon' hate, nigga, then hate
Don't let me fuck, then lil' bitch, you is bait
Don't wanna talk, no, I don't want debate
Bro flip the bricks just like Raf flipped the straight
I made a million right there on a Sunday
Woke up, I made two million on a Monday
You is my son, you will beat me up one day
I am too humble, nigga, that's my feng shui

[Chorus: Shabazz]
Shells, shells, shells, shells
Shells, shells, shells, shells
Shells, shells, shells, shells
Shells, shells, shells, shells
Shells, shells, shells, shells
Shells, shells, shells, shells
Shells, shells, shells, shells
Shells, shells, shells, shells
