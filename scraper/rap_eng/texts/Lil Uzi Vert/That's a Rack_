Lyrics from Snippet

[Intro]
Uh, uh
Oogie Mane he killed it
I'm working on dying

[Chorus]
Fuck from the back, hit her once, that’s a wrap
No strings attached, that’s a rack, that’s a rack
No strings attached, that’s a rack, that’s a rack
Water on my neck, swim through that, that's a lap
Fuck from the back, hit her once, that’s a wrap
No strings attached, that’s a rack, that’s a rack
No strings attached, that’s a rack, that’s a rack
Water on my neck, swim through that, that's a lap

[Verse]
Fendi knapsack, boy I'm speakin' Fendi facts
I don't want you back, you a thot, you a nat
Just like his bitch's ass, that fuck nigga will go get clapped
Put a pause on that, you still poor, I get racks

[Outro]
No strings attatched, that’s a rack, that’s a rack
No strings attatched, that’s a rack, that’s a rack
No strings attatched, that’s a rack, that’s a rack
No strings attatched, that’s a rack, that’s a rack
