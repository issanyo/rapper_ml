Lyrics from Snippet

[Verse]
[?]
Told her to lick it ima stick it ima hit it
No I do not know why all these girls be trippin
Diamonds they water look like the border that mean Pacific
Move the foreign yeah you cannot beat me so I am not missin
[?] No telling the score 100s boy fag it's Christmas
Boy watcha know about killing
Watcha know about drug dealing
Watcha know about them millions
Boy better mind yo business
[?] Was stuck on way to silly
She can't get in my feelings
[?] Sometimes I like to kick it
No I kept on feeling
