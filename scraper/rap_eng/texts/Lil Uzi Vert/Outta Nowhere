[Hook: Lil Uzi Vert]
Yeah, came outta nowhere, they ain't notice me
Yah, got my bandz up, yah, now they notice me
Yah, diamonds on my neck, yah, you ain't cold as me
Yah, granddad money, yah, money old as me
Yeah, came outta nowhere, they ain't notice me
Yah, got my bandz up, yah, now they notice me
Yah, diamonds on my neck, yah, you ain't cold as me
Yah, granddad money, yah, money old as me

[Verse 1: Lil Uzi Vert]
Passin' that bitch, I recycle that bitch and I fuck her again
Yah, stackin' my money, payback on my money, I go for the win
Yah, gettin' my money, got blue face for the hundred
Put dick in her tummy, that bitch all up on me
Put dick in her throat, make that bitch wanna vomit
Doin' the most, seven thousand my coat
That drum on my gun and that bitch not a Tommy
I might catch a homi right over this hottie
She got that whoadie, I fuck that bitch on my bed
She leave my sheets on the side, she know I'm black
But she look me in my eye, and that lil' bitch call me papi
You left the store, but they would not just admit it, the only nigga wanna top me
Told that lil' bitch that I stopped goin' to the gym cause my pockets so stocky
Thumbin' and fuckin', thumbin' and thumbin' and fuckin'
Yeah you know that be my hobby
Put dick in that girl, she got that turkey, I beat up the stuffing
Hold up, shh, change the subject, if you know it ain't really bout the money

Yah, got my bandz up, yah, now they notice me
Yah, diamonds on my neck, yah, you ain't cold as me

[Verse 2: Coca Vango]
They like "Coca came from nowhere"
Oh man, this shit ain't fair
Bad bitch from overseas, her pussy had no trains in her
Say that he want pressure, okay cool, we can take it there
Choppers on my screen, light your ass up like a city fair
All them diamonds in your necklace
They fugazi, they look crazy
Super cloudy, I spit loudy, screaming out that drop top Audi
Drop a twenty on the plastic, do gymanstics with the P word
Juugin' plays, foreign shoe, Balenciagas make your feet hurt
Chillin' with my hipster bitch, I swear that ho [?]
My baby momma look like Lauren, so I keep her in that new new
You be flexin' bout that paper, got that bankroll on me now
Juugin' thirteen shows in Texas, bitch you know about me nice
