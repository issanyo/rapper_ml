Lyrics from Snippet

Smokin' on this gas, little bitch can't smell, yeah
10 steps ahead so I cannot fail
Diamonds water like a well, yeah
Speakin' of the water yeah my pockets swell, duh
Aye, aye, aye, aye
What is the problem?
My homie pull up right with the llama
With this bitch on me "como se llama?"
All of my jewelry really be shinin'
On my wrist, on my finger like Sonic
On my wrist, on my finger like Sonic
Turn the record just um let me sign it, aye
Thought that I would never find it
Now I gotta keep my [?]
Yeah, my Glock
