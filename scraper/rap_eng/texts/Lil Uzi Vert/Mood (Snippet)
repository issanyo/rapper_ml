[Lyrics from Snippet]

[Chorus]
Like ooh, why you wanna mess up my mood
Wish that you were me cause you're not cool (yeah)
Lookin' like a fool, like a dog barking at the moon (why?)
Cause I'm shining, like look at these diamonds
Like look at these diamonds
Tired of these niggas I swear they be lying
I never keep me you know I'm on not
Doin' these drugs yeah I'm outta my body yeah
Real niggas, yea they right here right beside me

[Bridge]
Stay on track, rollercoaster, yeah
Fuck her once keep her closer yeah
My car fast but I drive slower (what)
Drop the top, make it hold up

[Verse 1]
Fuck these niggas cause they always being extra
All these diamonds on me I don't feel no pressure
Money coming in like I am an investor
She tried to take a break but I already left her

[Chorus]
Like ooh, why you wanna mess up my mood
Wish that you were me cause you're not cool (yeah)
Lookin' like a fool, like a dog barking at the moon (why?)
Cause I'm shining, like look at these diamonds
Like look at these diamonds
Tired of these niggas I swear they be lying
I never keep me you know I'm on not
Doin' these drugs yeah I'm outta my body yeah
Real niggas, yea they right here right beside me

[Bridge]
Stay on track, rollercoaster, yeah
Fuck her once keep her closer yeah
My car fast but I drive slower (what)
Drop the top, make it hold up

[Verse 1]
Fuck these niggas cause they always being extra
All these diamonds on me I don't feel no pressure
Money coming in like I am an investor
She tried to take a break but I already left her

[Chorus]
Like ooh, why you wanna mess up my mood
Wish that you were me cause you're not cool (yeah)
Lookin' like a fool, like a dog barking at the moon (why?)
Cause I'm shining, like look at these diamonds
Like look at these diamonds
Tired of these niggas I swear they be lying
I never keep me you know I'm on not
Doin' these drugs yeah I'm outta my body yeah
Real niggas, yea they right here right beside me

[Bridge]
Stay on track, rollercoaster, yeah
Fuck her once keep her closer yeah
My car fast but I drive slower (what)
Drop the top, make it hold up
