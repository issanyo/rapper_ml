[Intro]
Mic check (Mic check, mic check)
Yea
Ohh, ohh
Ohh

[Verse 1]
Got too many niggas just to buy a lamb
I need a whip, they got like seven doors
I need a crib, they got like seven floors
Gettin' dick sucked from like seven whores
At one time, that ain't my bitch
But that gun's mine, Riccardo Tisci
How I taught forces, I'm hearing voices
Bitch it's lunch time
She eat my dick out the Philip Lims
Bitch I'm [?] from like ten to ten
It was all for her to swallow my dick
Like my shit made a sentiment
Come in my hood all hooded up
Treat your ass like I'm Tsimmerman
Mortality like sub zero
My main hoe screamin' finish him
So I finish him
Half finished dope, Got it for the low
Bitch I'm smoother than the pennyloaf
I got the antidote
But the activis got me trappin' slow
Rick Owens straight off the runway
Rock Off White on a Monday
Let the [?] work, just talked to Virgil pots and pans work
Loosen up the Rollie with the hand work

[Ad-lib]
Ohh, Ohh, ohh
Yea
It's all [?]
[?] all [?]
Lil Uzi
Ahh

[Verse 2]
Got too many niggas just to buy a lamb
I need a whip, they got like seven doors
I need a crib, they got like seven floors
Gettin' dick sucked from like seven whores
At one time, that ain't my bitch
But that gun's mine, Re [?]
How I taught forces, I'm hearing voices
Bitch it's lunch time
She eat my dick out the Philip Lims
Bitch I'm [?] from like ten to ten
It was all for her to swallow my dick
Like my shit made a sentiment
Come in my hood all hooded up
Treat your ass like I'm Tsimmerman
Mortality like sub zero
My main hoe screamin' finish him
So I finish him
Half finished dope, Got it for the low
Bitch I'm smoother than the pennyloaf
I got the antidote
But the activis got me trappin' slow
Rick Owens straight off the runway
Rock Off White on a Monday
Let the [?] work, just talked to Virgil pots and pans work
Loosen up the Rollie with the hand work
With the hand work, hand work, handwork

[Verse 3]
Five AM, nigga writing verses
Dressed like Remie off higher learning
Talkin' shit I leave your face burnin'
New suit in the Sunday service
First class in the [?] hearse
So I was put here just for a purpose
Lil' fuck your bitch in the [?]
These [?] six is a not at Eargle
We got heavy shit, that's thirty-six
And that's like a seven
That's a perfect brick
If you cop six
Nigga you splurgin'
If you cop six
Nigga you splurgin'
Yea, yea, yea
