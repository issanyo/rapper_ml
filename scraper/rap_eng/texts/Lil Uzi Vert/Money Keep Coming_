Lyrics from Snippet

[Verse 1]
You be throwin' money in a spiral
Everytime your girl hear my song, yeah, turn her right into my hoe
She shake her ass with a eye roll
Got a skinny thong like a tightrope
I be blowin' up like some pyro
Coupe 150, call it Cairo
If she left with me, she the right hoe
Yeah, she ridin' me like a BMX
And she said the D is for dino
I got two horns like a rhino
There's no way you can buy ho
But I bought a mansion with the sly dough
Yes, I opened up the slide doors, so you can hear me hit the high notes

[Bridge]
[?]

[Chorus]
Money keep coming in, I can't lose
Money keep coming in, I can't lose
Four girls and they tens, I can't choose
Foreign car got me ten, I can't choose

[Verse 2]
I, different color hit my diamonds
I can't even see the time
I don't wanna see a face
[?]
Drop the top on my Wraith
I'm gon make him lose his mind
I just made 100K
It was quicker than a vine
I was swinging on my vine
Tryna put me down, but I climb
I'ma get it, get it [?]
[?]
You don't wanna step inside
We the ones that be [?]
