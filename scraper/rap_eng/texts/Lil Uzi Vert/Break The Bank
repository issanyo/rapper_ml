[Chorus: Lil Uzi Vert & Playboi Carti]
I'ma break the bank
I'ma break the bank
I'ma break the bank
I'ma break the bank
I'ma break the bank
Diamonds wet like, ooh
Diamonds wet like, ooh
I'ma break the bank
I'ma break the bank
Diamonds wet like sink
Diamonds wet like tank
Diamonds wet like ooh
Diamonds wet like lake
I'ma break the bank

[Verse 1: Lil Uzi Vert]
Diamonds wet like pond
Diamonds wet like lake
How much can you make?
How much can you make?
You ain't got no cake
You ain't got no cake
Lookin' at your Rollie
I can't tell the day
Lookin' at your chain, man
All your diamonds fake
And I be getting money
Lil boy, we can't relate
I been getting money
Lil boy, we can't relate
Feel like I'm on time but I'm really an hour late
What you pay for your Bentley what I pay for my Range
So basically what I'm saying stay in your price range
Bad lil' foreign bitch with me, yeah she from Iran
And when you see me chase the money, only time I ran

[Chorus: Lil Uzi Vert & Playboi Carti]
I'ma break the bank
I'ma break the bank
I'ma break the bank
I'ma break the bank
I'ma break the bank
Diamonds wet like, ooh
Diamonds wet like, ooh
I'ma break the bank
I'ma break the bank
Diamonds wet like sink
Diamonds wet like tank
Diamonds wet like ooh
Diamonds wet like lake
I'ma break the bank

[Verse 2: Playboi Carti]
Man, my hoe so bad
Man, she need to stop
Posted with the bag
All up on the block
I shoot at the opps
All these niggas talk
Man just check the watch
Choppa make you hip-hop
Choppa make 'em body rock
Fuckin' on his little thot
Pull up on yo' block with a fuckin' mop
All these niggas sound like Carti they some mocks
Shawty wanna fuck me 'cause I got the guap
Hoppin' off a jet, I had to check the charts
Bought that hoe a Fendi bag she tryna pop like tart

[Chorus: Lil Uzi Vert & Playboi Carti]
I'ma break the bank
I'ma break the bank
I'ma break the bank
I'ma break the bank
I'ma break the bank
Diamonds wet like, ooh
Diamonds wet like, ooh
I'ma break the bank
I'ma break the bank
Diamonds wet like sink
Diamonds wet like tank
Diamonds wet like ooh
Diamonds wet like lake
I'ma break the bank

[Verse 3: Lil Uzi Vert]
Carti off the Wock
Bitch I'm on the Xan, geekin' off the bar
Bitch I'm on the moon, talkin' to the stars
Choppa hit like fan, sounds like a guitar
Bitch you talk too much, call my phone too much, then I hit ignore
Carti hit me up, said, "I got the twins," boy I hit 'em raw
I do not shop at the mall, but I do flex in the mall
I keep my stick in the car
I take my nine to the mall, I take my nine to the mall
I swear my pockets got large, walk around pockets on large

[Chorus: Lil Uzi Vert & Playboi Carti]
I'ma break the bank
I'ma break the bank
I'ma break the bank
I'ma break the bank
I'ma break the bank
Diamonds wet like, ooh
Diamonds wet like, ooh
I'ma break the bank
I'ma break the bank
Diamonds wet like sink
Diamonds wet like tank
Diamonds wet like ooh
Diamonds wet like lake
I'ma break the bank
