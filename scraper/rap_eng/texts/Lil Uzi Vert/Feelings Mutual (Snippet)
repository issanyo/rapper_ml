[Lyrics from Snippet]

[ Verse 1 ]
Back then outside would have bought you
Gave you my racks and i splurge too
Calling my phone and I curve you
Hope this song don't really hurt you
AP Froze, copped the tool
Yeah i'm all in my coupe
( ? )
They keep on telling me
All these girls up in the club, why you looking at me?
I am not worried cause when my niggas come in they gonna need a white girly
( ? )
She give me head so I call her a nerd

[Hook]
I can't feel, no
I can't feel, I can't feel
I can't feel, my body sore
It  because I am so hurt
I feel the pain, ( ? )
( ? )
Not my first merry-go-round
Not my first merry-go-round yea
Living life just with a curse
That's why i'm calling a hearse
Told you that I love you first
Told you that I love you first, oo
Now a days I gotta swerve, oo
I took you out of the front, oops

[Verse 2]
I'm doing fine now, I'm doing fine now
No I do not need nobody now
No I do not need nobody now
No girl that will make a sound
I don't wanna talk about body count
You don't wanna talk about body count
You don't wanna talk about body count
( ? )
Used some bodies, now i'm fine now
Used some bodies I don't know about
( ? )
( ? )
But I love to see you burning out
But I love to see you burning out
( ? )
( ? )
( ? )
( ? )
( ? )

[Hook]
I can't feel, no
I can't feel, I can't feel
I can't feel, ( ? )
Different cause I am so hot
I feel the pain, ( ? )
( ? )
Now my first merry-go-round
Now my first merry-go-round yea
Living life just with a curse
That's why i'm calling a hearse
Told you that I love you first
Told you that I love you first, oo
Now a days I gotta swerve, oo
I took you out of the front, oops
