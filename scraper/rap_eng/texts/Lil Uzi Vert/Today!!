Know I'm getting money, had to flood my wrist today, yeah
Heard you go with her but that's my bitch today, huh
Driving in the Lamb but I'mma get the Wraith, yeah
Now I'm gettin' bands, that girl all up in my face, what
Now I'm getting money, had to flood my wrist today, yeah
Heard you go with her but that's my bitch today, huh
Driving in the lamb but I'mma get the Wraith, yeah
Now I'm gettin' bands, that girl all up in my face, what

[Verse: Lil Uzi Vert]
I already fucked so I can't take you on no date
I was watching Food Network to learn how to make the cake
You don't understand how I made it
I don't understand how you tryna hate
Stop all that savin', no no cape
Colors and chains look like Bape
I play with her kitty like hello
All my jewelry is real metal
Your style stale like a chip in a kettle
Flowers on that Murakami and petal
Listen, I be outside like a night owl
Tryna be my friend, tryna cop out
All of my visitors shot out
Jump in my whip, now the top out
Jump in my whip, bring the lot out
Look at my pockets, they stuffed
'Cause you know I bring the lot out
I kill a beat like a drop out
Don't wanna fuck, then bitch hop out
Come on bitch, right now
Count so much I need to lie down

Know I'm getting money, had to flood my wrist today, yeah
Heard you go with her but that's my bitch today, huh
Driving in the lamb but I'mma get the Wraith, yeah
Now I'm gettin' bands that girl all up in my face, what
