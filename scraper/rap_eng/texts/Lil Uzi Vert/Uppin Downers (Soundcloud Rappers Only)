[Intro]
I don't wanna go if it's not no pills there (no)

Tweak... Damn, DJ Plugg, you just killed it
Yeah, get it, please, please, yeah

[Hook]
I take Addy just to keep me up
I take Xanny just to bring me down
I take Molly just to keep me up
Took a 30 just to bring me down
After your bitch done booting up
Then she turn her frown upside down
Went to the store like, "Add me up"
Told that fuck nigga, "Go wipe me down"
I was on Addy to keep me up
I was on Xanny to bring me down
I was on Molly to keep me up
I was on 30's to bring me down
I was on Addy to keep me up
I was on Xanny to bring me down
I was on Molly to keep me up
I was on 30's to bring me down

[Verse 1]
I don't wanna go if it's not no pills there (no)
I'm from 1600, know some niggas still there (yeah)
Tweakin' and geekin' off Molly and Xanny and Perky and Addy (whoo)
Gettin' this money, my hundreds so crispy, I'm gettin' this cabbage
Still the same nigga, eat my salmon blackened
Told that nigga I fucked on his bitch gladly
That lil' bitch mad 'cause she really can't have me
She sucked my dick with a piece of candy
Looked in my eyes, said she can't stand me
Talk to my foreign, it talkin' right back
10 double G's and I'm takin' 'em things
Jump in the 'Rari, everything went black

[Hook]
I take Addy just to keep me up

[Verse 2]
All of my diamonds, they start wit' V
Swerve in the 'Rari, it ain't got no key
All of you rappers are hot to me
Because y'all all remind me of me
I was just normal, I went through a portal
Now my life changed like I'm Mr. Deeds
Fuck that bih once, then I dip
Fuck that bih once, then I dip
Fuck that bih once, then I dip
Fuck that bih once, then I dip
Fuck the bitch once, then I hit delete
She so wet, might have to repeat
She drink the pints of the lean
She drink the pints of the lean
I smoke the pounds of the green
She was on Oxy by 3
She was on Oxy by 3
She was on Roxi and E
She put her body on me
She throw her body on me
I am first 'cause I'm A1 and you Z
Takin' Addys 'til I really can't see
