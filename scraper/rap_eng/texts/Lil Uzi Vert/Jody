Aye aye lil uzi

[Hook: Lil Uzi Vert]
Jody if you don't know me aye
Fuckin' your mama like Jody
Stay with your momma like Jody
Doin' it right with my woadie
Ballin' like I am just Kobe
Why my car ain't got no top, kinda look like it Ginobli

[Verse 1]
My belt it just be Goyard, driving around in a Rover
Put the chopper on my chauffeur
My little bitch hold the toaster
I feel like Tony Montana, lil nigga ain't got no [?]
Swerving around on them lanes aye
Forgiatos on the roadster
Lil uzi he is so young aye
He's on your girlfriend poster, he on your little sister poster aye
I fuck my bitch with a choker
She on my dick hot like poker
Knockin' your ass out like you coke though
Knockin' your ass out like you coke though

[Hook: Lil Uzi Vert]
Jody if you don't know me aye
Fuckin' your mama like Jody
Stay with your momma like Jody
Ballin' like I am just kobe
Why my car ain't got no top, kinda look like it Ginobli
Jody if you don't know me aye
Fuckin' your mama like Jody
Stay with your momma like Jody
Ballin' like I am just kobe
Why my car ain't got no top, kinda look like it Ginobli

[Verse 2: Spodee]
Had the K and bought a scope
Used to get my yay up out the boat
Puzzled with the young niggas, charged em 50 1 4
You official I don't know
A lot of these niggas talkin' these pistol for sure
Boy you broker than municipal coke
Caught em slippin' now its dick in his hoe
These niggas pansies I walk in the freshest
They want something so I'ma give em a show
Maison Margielas walkin' so elegant
As I'm spillin lean on the floor
Watch for my laces, smokin' like aces
Fuck you leavin' my condo is spacious
Japanese denim fill it with face
Went to cop it for I went on winter vacation
Bad bitches keep calling my line
I'm single so I fuck em two at a time
Italian leather on the seat of the vert
Before you get it put my feet on the work
Remember when I was broke used to have to eat on the turf
When in California get you some money
On the tour bus me and lil uzi vert

[Hook: Lil Uzi Vert]
Jody if you don't know me aye

Fuckin' your mama like Jody
Stay with your momma like Jody
Ballin' like I am just kobe
