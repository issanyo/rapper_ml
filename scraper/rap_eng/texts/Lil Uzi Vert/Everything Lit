[Verse]
Boy, you disgust me
Why is yo bitches so ugly?
My bitch so perfect, she kinda look Asian (yeah)
Come all the way from Toronto
All she do is sucky-sucky
My stomach problem from all of this muddy
No money problems ‘cause I’m gettin’ money (money)
This shit is crazy, it just started for me
I was just home, broke, doin’ the dougie
Pinky ring, water-flooded
Wrist got cold yellow diamond runnin’
Grab a tissue if it is an issue (damn)
Used to grab a pistol
No, I didn’t for them itty-bitty niggas
I’m from the city with real killers
Nigga Gilly said, “ya’ gon’ win now”
Uzi countin’ all these major figures
Getting money, got a major hitter
But I ain’t talkin’ Barry Bonds (yeah)
When I was younger, wanted Keri Hilson
Nigga like Dennis the Menace
Now my money old like Mr. Wilson (yeah)
Sneak dissing, who you? The records be missing
I fuck with Hit-Boy, I’m tryna be a hitman
Takin’ yo ass straight out of existence
Where is yo hitman? The other man got him
Shout out Jodye Flacko, fuck wit’ your album
Moving them pigeons, them birds, they be flockin’
White bitch on my dick, she ride like a ‘Rari
When I get rough, she crank that like a cock-shift
She shake her ass on my dick like a cocktail
I could’ve fucked your bitch right in L.A
SLS, she play with my Carter case
I had put some money right in the safe
Didn’t do nothin’, was high, it was late
But we still talk on the phone everyday
About goin' on that perfect date
She hear my name, pussy on percolate
Only date if my dick all in her face (woo)
Wait, 4-5, that’s all on my waist (all on my waist)
Wait, why these niggas in the way?
Why do these niggas be frontin’
They just be there with no office
Most of they’re parents be owning they office
That both of my parents pray more than less often
My old bitch always be gaggin’ and coughin’
My new bitch, she swallow me up so jawless
I want the money, the fame, and the barbie
You know, the white bitch that look like iCarly
She ride my dick like that bitch is a Harley (skrrt)
I just got Energy jewels that was counterfeit (counterfeit)
Clock rounds like my VVS diamond wrist
Everything real, so keep on watchin' it (watchin' it)
If you watchin' me, then you watchin' it (you watchin' it)
My new bitch asked where is the profit for this (profit for this)
Gettin' money really ain't no option, bitch (no option)
Watch your mommy and the lie detectors said (oh)
Boy, I swear you did not write the script (oh)
Never really was a fan, though
Four-door coupe, open just like a sandal
We used to pray for them Lambos
I take my girl to a private resort
Heard we walk 'round wearin' sandals
My bitch so bad, she a handful
That's why she treat me so good
Wake up the pussy and eggs, they be scrambled
Everything lit
Everything, everything, everything lit
Everything lit like a candle
Ohh, she gave me head like some dandruff
Everything, it is so random
Love and rage, it is so random
Love and rage, it is so random
