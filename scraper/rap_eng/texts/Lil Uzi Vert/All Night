Dis dat bruised up in a bar fight
Fuckin' all on a prostitute like all night (All night)
Dat nigga got shot in the head so all white

Look at yo bitch on my dick (all on my dick) - Ooh

She all on my wood like that bitch is a termite
Told her nigga that the tables turn baby

Don't fuck with rats so I curve mice

All of these niggas not with it they bitchin'
Most of these niggas out here to be snitchin'
Look at my necklace then look at  my wrist
Now look at my ring Lil Uzi the richest
I'm not on the Yankees I'm not on the Cardinals
I'm not on the White Sox
But I just be pitchin'
I'm smokin' the gas now I'm gon' off the Buddha
These niggas shoot at me I swear they be missin'
I'm beating the pot then I'm beating the pussy
I'm beating the nigga up like I am Sonny Liston
I flex on my exes no I'm not from Texas
But I just be saucin' and drippin'  and drippin'
Saucin' and drippin' and saucin' and drippin'
And saucin' and drippin' and drippin' and drippin' (saucin'!)

[Hook]

Look at yo bitch on my dick (all on my dick) - Ooh

[Verse 2]
Used to drink more Fiji water than water
Now I drink more water than Fiji
People like Beanie
Free my lil brother Lil Leafy
Talkin' that shit bake you just like some ziti
I got a cousin named [?], Raheem, Diamond, Khalil, Beanie and Fifty
Back in the days on Leland
Used to smoke on that reggie watch pornos on CD's
All my OG's had TV's in the headrest
You know in the brand new Lexus
I'm on my soap opera shit
I am so young and the restless
Sometimes I feel like I'm Drama
I am so young and I'm reckless
My dad had that motorcycle
Fuckin' up the intersection
He was getting that street money
Getting that shit by the Hefty
Moving that work - it was heavy (moving that work)
He is still here that is a blessing (yeah!)
I am Raf Simons dressing
I am Rick Owens stepping
Bad bitch on Instagram and I hit that direct message
