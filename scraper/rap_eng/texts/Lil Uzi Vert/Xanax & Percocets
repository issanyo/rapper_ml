[Intro: Phat Geez]
Oh shit!

[Hook: Phat Geez]
Can't wait til i fly pass, switchin' gears on you haters hit the gas
Smack a couple on her ass, she gone do what I ask x2

[Chorus: Lil Uzi]
Xan, Perc, Lean run thru the lobby, got yo bitch in the Porsche jump out the alley, drive around went and bought a Maserati, dumpin right thru the trap thats my hobby
Said that Xan, Perc, Lean run thru the lobby, fucked yo bitch in the Porsche jump out the alley, drive around went and bought a Maserati, dumpin right thru the trap thats my hobby

[Verse 1: Phat Geez]
Ballin' my hobby, smokin cabbage countin broccoli
Rotweiler that Givenchy, swagga drippin' out the lobby
Got my niggas right beside me, please don't turn this to a robbery, We got chickens talkin' nine piece, we still watchin' out for Squally
Get some paper put my mans on, cause they was there when I was dead broke, blowing fetti all blue notes
Mama need the foreign with the red bow, far as money you ain't see no dough
That's a fake roley nigga you ain't low, thats a fake roley nigga you ain't low
When I get that money I'ma make it blow, i can't wait til I

[Hook]

[Chorus]

[Verse 2: Phat Geez]
Swerin' swervin' got my cash right, money make them bitches act right, I done seen how niggas act now
For some pussy eat ya back out, got some shmoney I'm relaxed now, I'm so hungry hunt the cash down
Demons on me never back down, got them demons never back down, drinking lean I almost drowned
Think I smoked about a pound, them bitches fucking for the rounds, them bitches fucking for the rounds
Fresh to death on my black ish, with my dogs on my X ish
Rap niggas too extra, with a Spanish bitch I'm getting back rubs

[Hook]

[Chorus]
