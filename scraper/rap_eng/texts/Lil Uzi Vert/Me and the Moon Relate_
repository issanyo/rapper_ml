Lyrics from Snippet

[Verse 1]
Super geeked up, walking on a tightrope
She think she in love, but just want my dough
I'm numb from the pain, all these girls are psycho
Drivin' in the Lamb, swerving round the potholes
Know I got my gun everywhere that I go
Tatted up my face, I look like a psycho
She think she in love, but just want my dough
I'm numb from the pain, all these girls are psycho
Rocking my suit like a mobster, rocking my suit like a model
None of these girls are my problem, none of these girls are my problem
Call that girl, suck, chew, and swallow, call that girl, suck, chew, and swallow
Numb from the pain 'cause I'm honest, only worried bout them dollar

[Chorus]
Hey, I done got numb from the pain
All of these girls the same
Who's the one to blame?
Nowadays, you not the same
I flood my wrist out today
I hit your girl in my Wraith
I hit your girl in my Wraith
In a spaceship, outer space
Geeking on Mars yesterday
Now I'm on Pluto today
I look the moon in its face
I look the moon in its face
Me and the moon relate
Me and the moon relate
Me and the moon relate
Me and the moon relate

[Verse 2]
I gotta stack up my cake
Getting them chips like it's Lay's
Man, my donuts like it's glazed
Man, my donuts like it's glazed
You know she told me you lame
Me and you, boy, not the same
Don't give a fuck what you bang
1600 what I claim

[Interlude]
Bah
Doot doot doot doot doot doot doot doot doot doot doot doot doot doot doot doot doot doot doot doot doot doot doot doot doot doot doot doot doot doot doot

[Verse 3]
My niggas aim at the brain
Nowadays, these niggas do anything just for the fame
You got a stick, I got a chopper
These bitches don't hit the same
Don't hit the same, like, boy, you not the same
What is you saying?
Turned to a fool with the K
Turned to a fool with the K
Get that girl out of my face
'Rari so fast, we race

[Chorus]
Hey, I done got numb from the pain
All of these girls the same
Who's the one to blame?
Nowadays, you not the same
I flood my wrist out today
I hit your girl in my Wraith
I hit your girl in my Wraith
In a spaceship, outer space
Geeking on Mars yesterday
Now I'm on Pluto today
I look the moon in its face
I look the moon in its face
Me and the moon relate
Me and the moon relate
Me and the moon relate
Me and the moon relate

[Outro: Lil Uzi Vert]
Me and the moon relate
Me and the moon relate
Me and the moon relate
Me and the moon relate
