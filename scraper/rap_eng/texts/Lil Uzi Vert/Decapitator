[Intro]
Lets get it, Lil Uzi
Lets get it yeah

Okay
I'm not with the funny shit
I need my money quick, if you don't got it catch fold
And if they come after me, turn to catastrophe
Hundred round drum no reload (reload)
And If I die fore I wake
Pray to lord for my soul to take, thats how it goes
Its fucked up we not in the same position
You sell your soul just for some gold
I'm not with the funny shit
I need my money quick, if you don't it catch fold
And If they come after me, turn to catastrophe
Hundred round drum no reload (reload)
If I die fore I wake, pray the lord my soul to take, thats how it goes
It's fucked up we not in the same position
You sell your soul just for some gold
Okay not with the funny shit I need my money quick

[Verse 1]
My body keep shakin' my head it keep turning
It's fucked niggas up get some money turning so cold (haha)
The cops was just after me
Jack boy was after me shit I don't know where to go
That's why I got these gats on me, hundred round don't reload
Yeah yeah lil uzi
I don't even smoke (you know it)
Just roll me something
I don't even smoke (I don't)
About to roll me something, I am
I don't even smoke, I don't even smoke
This money keep comin'
These threats do not phase me
I will get you touched for the low
I'm whippin up baby this shit is amazing
What I do on grandmamas stove (stove)
I'm countin' big faces, these niggas be hatin'
My killers be totin' these poles
And if you take picture of that lil money
You will be the lick for the show
And when it rains nigga it pours
And when it sleet nigga it snows
This summer I'm stuntin', I'm hot as a oven
The sun hit my chain now it glows
And when it rains nigga it pours
And when it sleet nigga it snows
This summer I'm stuntin', I'm hot as a oven
The sun hit my chain now it glows
