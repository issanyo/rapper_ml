Guy: For who?
Dolemite: Dolemite, motherfucker, ya heard?

[Chorus]
Aye, I just got rid of my boo
I might just swerve in a Coupe

Popping these pills they be blue
My chain so tight like a noose
Watch, I be flexin' on you
Riding around we go vroom

[Refrain]
Riding around wit' my crew
Riding around wit' my crew
Riding around wit' my crew
I'm riding around wit' my crew
Riding around wit' my crew

Riding around we go vroom
Watch how we flexin' on You (Flexin' on you)

[Verse 1]
Aye, bitch i ain't checking on you
Aye, lil bitch i pity the fool
Aye, counting these bills, they be blue
Aye, get the money snooze you loose

[Chorus]
Aye, I just got rid of my boo
I might just swerve in a coupe
I fucked your girls in my coupe
Popping these pills, navy blue
My chain so tight like a noose
Watch, I be flexin' on you
Riding around we go vroom

[Post-Chorus]
Aye, get the money snooze you loose
Aye, get the money snooze you loose
Aye, get the money snooze you loose
Riding around wit' my crew

[Verse 2]
I am so sick, like the flu
Getting money like a Jew
Spend a hundred on my jewels
Feel like Santana with my Jewels
Thick white girl right on my side (Yeah)
She kinda look like um Yes Julz
No you can't come to my room
With them clothes on that's my rule
I leave you wetter then a pool
I fuck you right there in your shoes
I fuck you right there girl don't move
I leave you right there girl don't move
I flew around and I groove
I stick it right there 'cause I'm cool

[Bridge]
Yeah, I just need to find
I, I just need to find love
I, I just need to find love
I, I just need to find love

[Chorus]
Aye, I just got rid of my boo
I might just swerve in a coupe
I fucked your girls in my coupe
Popping these pills, navy blue
My chain so tight like a noose
Watch, I be flexin' on you
Riding around we go vroom

[Post-Chorus]
Aye, get the money snooze you loose
Aye, get the money snooze you loose
Aye, get the money snooze you loose
Riding around wit' my crew
Riding around wit' my crew

[Outro]
