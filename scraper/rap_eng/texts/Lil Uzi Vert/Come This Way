[Chorus]
Yeah, what
Took your girl and you can't find her
Yeah she in my kitchen whip it up like Benihana
Yeah she roll with me cause I'm known to stack the commas
She will not play me every time I try to holla
Come this way, come this way (yea)
Come this way, come this way (yea)
Come this way, come this way (yuh)
Come this way, come this way (yuh)

[Verse 1: Lil Uzi Vert]
Boy I get so fly that I coulda been a stylist

What I spent on Wang coulda sent my bitch to college (aye)

Never really care but these niggas tryna kill my style
I’m not talkin' bout them niggas, there’s too many girls around

[Verse 2: Lil Uzi Vert]
Smoking on some high dream
Got my eyes red I'm might need some Visine
Swervin' in a Lambo not a i8 (not a motherfuckin' i8)
I keep stuffing money in my safe

You can not hold her, yeah
Diamonds got colder like its pneumonia
Move around with a badder chick

[Chorus]
Yeah, what
Took your girl and you can't find her

Yeah she roll with me cause I'm known to stack the commas
She will not play me every time I try to holla
Come this way, come this way (yeah)
