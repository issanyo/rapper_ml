Too much drip, walk in, Drip
Tell your bitch, I got too much diss
Aye, .40 Glock, yuh
No smith and wesson my hip
Yeah, what you sip, what you sip
(that crazy) DRIP (yeah)
How you do that, Uh huh, yea
All my diamonds knockout
Them bitches blue black
I don't want that lil bitch back
I fucked that bitch from the back
I eat at, Ocean park
You eat at outback
You ain't got swag
Kangaroo jump in that pussy
Kangaroo jump in that hoe
Why they tryna jump in my glo
Why they tryna jump in my hmph
Why they tryna jump in the snow
I did too
Got one more year for my diamonds
All of my diamonds they shining
And my pants, that is Raf Simons
How you do that you got swag
I can't get that from my mother
I can't get that from my dad
I got that from just gettin' the bag
Hm, Cash, 300 rocks
All of my watches can talk
Sike, this cannot talk
Diamonds they ripped
Your diamonds, they RIP
My diamonds they rick
Black, white, stack
All your money tryna be like me
I fuck your bitch and your main wifey(Hm)
How you do that?
Slurpee my chain, 'cause this shit icy
Told your bitch that she cannot see me
Sip out the straw I get so high-c(hehehe)
