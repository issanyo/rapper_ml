[Intro: Rambo Savage]
Uzi, where the fuck we at?

[Chorus: Lil Uzi Vert]
In a room with a hunnid million dollars (hunnid million dollars, aye)
Ain't got no money, that's a broke nigga problem (yeah)
That's on you bitch, aye
I said that's on you bitch, aye
On the real, no, I don't need a stylist (no I don't)
Bet you do, do you see this Goyard wallet? (where your wallet at?)
That's on you bitch, aye (yeah, that's on you)
I said that's on you bitch, aye (yeah)

[Verse 1: Lil Uzi Vert]
Bitches come and go but my money stay (stay)
My money stay (yeah)
Can't see in front of me, all this money in the way
Spent like 50 in a day
Spent like 25 in half of a day
OG Bape belt that's all on my waist
Baby said, "Uzi, you is so great"
Take a Xanax 'til I can't feel my face
I'ma clap a nigga just like I know ya
So far [?] ain't got no holster
Jump in the Range, that bitch got a chauffeur
Lean in the soda, was in the cup holder
I just brought my new side bitch in a Lotus
Look at these diamonds, that bitch is like water
I ain't ever been, but I got hoes
That's stay in Bora Bora
Call up Donald Trump and tell him, "My bitch, yeah
She comin' just straight from the border"
Come to this Balmain, this Saint Laurent, Fendi
I swear to God that I'm a hoarder
Your money is getting smaller (aye)
My money is getting taller
My jewelry is getting clearer, aye
Your jewelry is getting darker
That's on you

[Chorus: Lil Uzi Vert]
In a room with a hunnid million dollars (hunnid million dollars, aye)
Ain't got no money, that's a broke nigga problem (yeah)
That's on you bitch, aye
I said that's on you bitch, aye
On the real, no, I don't need a stylist (no I don't)
Bet you do, do you see this Goyard wallet? (where your wallet at?)
That's on you bitch, aye (yeah, that's on you)
I said that's on you bitch, aye (yeah)

[Verse 2: Rory Fresco]

[Verse 3: Rambo Savage]
That's on you, that's on you and you and you
If you broke as fuck, stay out my lane, stay out my way
I don't got time for the lames, for the fakes
I'ma make that money right, I'ma make it any day, any way
Wanna see you try to stop me anyway
I'ma never stop, tell these snakes get up out my way, out my lane
I'ma drop it down with that Uzi in your face
I'ma make you say my name, say my name
Rambo Savage on the way
I'ma blow it up
Don't you see these diamonds glowin' up?
Don't you see? I'm just warmin up
I'ma do what you niggas coulda never done
