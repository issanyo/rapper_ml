[Intro]
G-g-g-good Work Charlie, hahahaha

[Verse]
Eight hundred gods, yes I be with like eight hundred guys
In the kitchen whip eight hundred pies
Disrespectful, you a son of mine
I will hit you with this gun of mine
Wet you like you just got baptized
Bitch, I stay right in that trap house
Whippin' bricks and off that Act high
You the type nigga that act high
Talkin' shit, nigga, no rap back
I'ma have to make them bullets fly
Lil Uzi lit up ten guys
Fuck your bitch then make her pussy cry
Then I might have to take you out
Like four-five have your ass penalized
Honestly, you not a friend of mine
Whippin' up, whippin' that thirty-six
Everything, use these them dirty bricks
Tryna rob me, boy you dumb as shit
Extended clip right on that forty-fifth
And we don't say thot, we say "cat", nigga
So tell that cat just to come eat the dick
Turn around clappin' then do a split
Put 24k on a nigga wrist
Pay eighty for platinum in nigga mouth
You owe me some money, run in your house
And that be your bitch, but she gave me mouth
I aimed for her face, skeeted on her blouse
And that be your side-relation child
And Lil Uzi Vert, yeah he OD wild
And I sip that lean, purple in my mouth
I feel like Rick James steppin' on your couch

[Outro]
Let's get it!
Lil Uzi, Lil Uzi, Lil Uzi
Fuck it all, Lil Uzi
Lil Uzi, young nigga
