[Verse 1: Lil Uzi Vert]
Rolli and it's fludded, can’t even see what the time is
Bitch, I'm in the zone, need to take a break for timing
I'm the nigga with the keys, so I look like a locksmith
He ain’t goin thro the hoop, drive through that bitch just like a drive stick
She from the islands, that bitch so tropic
Gotta be a 10, keep my side bitch on the Persion islands
When I fuck the hoe, get wilder than a mosh pit
All about the money, conversation, drop it
Gonna fuck me a hoe, that be for show
Glocc 9 with the poll, that be for show
Make a nigga take a toll, I take the poll
My young niggas bout to throgh yo bolls like the main hoe
Feelin like a mobster, eating all this pasta
Sometimes it be Lobster, you niggas impostors
Look at me like I'm your father
Me and your bitch kick it, just like soccer

[Hook: Lil Uzi Vert]
Member I was loanley, 50 bands, that's on me
Now I got every bitch, never loanley
Everybody know me, I say everybody know me

[Verse 2: Jban$2Turnt]
Pockets, yeah, they got 50s
Everybody know me
Keep that stick, I'm never loanley
Bankroll, no folding
Say he got it better, show me
4 G Auto Rolli, no tick tockin in my rolli
Cook it up, bend it over
Yeah, we sold D
Choppers on my homies, so you know I'm not laughin if you know me
Paranoid, I got 20,000 on me
She from the islands, not from my born place
From the land where they're screaming fuck the police
You will not Trayvon me
Pistol in my hoodie

[Hook: Lil Uzi Vert]
Member I was loanley, 50 bands, that's on me
Now I got every bitch, never loanley
Everybody know me, I say everybody know me
