[Lyrics from Snippet]

Hey now
[?], hundreds all over the place
[?], they keep bustin' out the safe
Want it now, I was never one to wait
I was never one to hate, spin it off with the gang, aye
Imma keep being me
You know I always keep it G
I ain't never want a Jeep
Pull up Bentley with the B
Pull up Bentley with the B
Bentley truck got no keys
Same goal set as me
Louis V's on the feet
I receive all the work
Get it clean by the 1st
I retrieve off the perc
She cost a quarter
She gon do what I want, she gon do what I please
Talk to me on your knees
Where's my nerd, smoke a P
Tell me girl what's the fee
Cause I want you to leave
I get off with the beat
