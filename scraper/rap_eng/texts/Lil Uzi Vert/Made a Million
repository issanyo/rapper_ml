[Intro]
All by myself

[Hook]
Flexin', finessin' different deals
I came from the hood, now I'm here
Zonin', zonin' when I'm off them pills (Zonin' when I'm off the xannies)
I'ma keep singin' 'til the deal (I'ma keep singin' to them bills)
I made a million by myself (Made a million by myself)
I made a million by myself (Made a million by myself)
I made a million by myself (Made a million by myself)
I made a million by myself (Made a million by myself)

[Verse 1]
I count a million by myself (I count a million by myself)
Young rich nigga wealth (Young rich nigga wealth)
I paid a thousand for my belt (Paid a thousand for my belt)
And that's rich nigga welps (I'ma beat your fuckin' ass)
I done did it on my own, trappin' out the phone
I been takin' Xannies, they got me so gone
I say she ain't got no panties, look like Nia Long
Thinkin' we should go Miami, when I made this song
I swear that I do the randomness, I must be in love
I swear I'm smokin' on cannabis, it's all in my lungs
Fuck with me, you feel these hollow tips, that was in my gun
Made a million, I was by myself, diamonds like the sun

[Hook]
Flexin', finessin' different deals
I came from the hood, now I'm here
Zonin' when I'm off them pills (Zonin' when I'm off the xannies)
I'ma keep singin' 'til the deal (I'ma keep singin' to them bills)
I made a million by myself (Made a million by myself)
I made a million by myself (Made a million by myself)
I made a million by myself (Made a million by myself)
I made a million by myself (Made a million by myself)

[Bridge]
Niggas hatin' on me 'cause my money up ('Cause  my money up)
Niggas hatin' on me 'cause my money up ('Cause  my money up)
They ain't gon' do shit, so I don't give a fuck (I don't give a fuck)
They ain't gon' do shit, so I don't give a fuck (No I don't)
Niggas hatin' on me 'cause my money up (Gaaawd)
Niggas hatin' on me 'cause my money up (Stooop)
They ain't gon' do shit, so I don't give a fuck (sneaking and geeking)
They ain't gon' do shit, so I don't give a fuck (What?!)

[Verse 2]
I'm on a roll
Countin' these dollars and countin' these rolls
And she workin', she ridin' the pole
Look at my chain, that bitch is on snow
Look at my phone, you might find your hoe
I swear to God, I do not trust a hoe
I do not never keep up with hoes
I just change them like I change my clothes

[Hook]
Flexin', finessin' different deals
I came from the hood, now I'm here
Zonin' when I'm off them pills (Zonin' when I'm off the xannies)
I'ma keep singin' 'til the deal (I'ma keep singin' to them bills)
I made a million by myself (Made a million by myself)
I made a million by myself (Made a million by myself)
I made a million by myself (Made a million by myself)
I made a million by myself (Made a million by myself)
