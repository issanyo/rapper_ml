Lyrics from Snippet

[Intro: Ballout]
My bitch wanna fuck bro
I'm so icy and I'm cutthroat (yeah, ooh)
Run them bands up, I get 'em pronto (zee)
In the hellcat, blue hunchos

[Chorus: Lil Uzi Vert]
I ain't worried about that bitch, I got racks (ya, ooo)
If they shoot at us, we gon' pop back (faa, yuh)
You keep acting tough, need to stop that (yaah)
I'm already done, can have your thot back (yeah)
Thot back (aye)
Thot back (yeah)
Thot back (woah)
Thot back (yaaah, aye)
Look at you in love, you got your thot back (ooh)
She think Imma cuff baby it's not that (oooh)

[Verse 1: Lil Uzi Vert]
Hit it once, ugh, kick that bitch to the curb
T-to the curb, ooh, kick that bitch to the curb (yah)
I don't know if it was good, hit her off the perc
She heard this song, ooh, said that boy right there a jerk
Give me brain, turn me lame, to a nerd
Thirty boppers, got them choppers, rock the percs
Brand new for-
