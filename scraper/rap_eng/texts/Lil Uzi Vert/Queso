[Hook: Lil Uzi Vert]
My bitch Spanish, told her twerk, then she hit the salsa
You need twenty, thirty, forty, that's how much it cost ya'
Mixin' up that perico,  spread it on the table
My plug good, he mix the yayo, queso, queso, queso
My plug good, he mix the yayo, queso, queso, queso
My plug good, he mix the yayo, queso, queso, queso
My plug good, he mix the yayo, queso, queso, queso

[Verse 1: Lil Uzi Vert]
Money, carat, diamond necklace
Thousand dollar checklist
Bitch, I'm flexin', we start sexin'
Now that bitch so restless
Panamera Rari, forgi, bitch, I'm young and reckless
My chain got on praying hands
'Cause my life a blessin'
We start smokin' in the dams
Now I smoke a section
You is not allowed in the real nigga section
Hundred dollar, salad, fifty dollar dressin'
Money, pussy, sober, they can't smell stressin'
Daylight, hoes is whippin' lotus
They so poker, built like joker
Glock no holster (pistol burning)
Pockets on Al Roker
Lean or soda, what you holdin'?
My bitch golden, her ass swollen
Gucci Jones and why you foldin'?
Your bitch hatin' on my homies

[Interlude 1]
That queso, that queso, that queso
Hey, hey, hey, hey

[Hook: Lil Uzi Vert]
My bitch Spanish, told her twerk, then she hit the salsa
You need twenty, thirty, forty, that's how much it cost ya'
Mixin' up that perico, spread it on the table
My plug good, he mix the yayo, queso, queso, queso
My plug good, he mix the yayo, queso, queso, queso
My plug good, he mix the yayo, queso, queso, queso
My plug good, he mix the yayo, queso, queso, queso

[Verse 2: Wiz Khalifa]
Fuck your man, bitches wanna fuck with Young Khalifa
'Cause I got that sauce, I be bunkin' through your speakers
Married to the money, fuck her once, then I don't need her
Big booty Latina, twerkin', while she roll my weed up
All my niggas on, Lil' Uzi hit me for a feature
Never trust a broad, ya'll some unstable creatures
Chevy get the call, I'm in Cali', we should link up
Back when I was young, servin' strong in-front the teachers
Now I'm much older, prices way cheaper
Came a long way from that Motorola beeper
Movin' state to state with just an iPhone and a Sidekick
Upgrade the room and get a flight for my lil' side bitch

[Interlude 2]
That queso, that queso, that queso
Hey, hey, hey, hey

[Hook: Lil Uzi Vert]
My bitch Spanish, told her twerk, then she hit the salsa
You need twenty, thirty, forty, that's how much it cost ya'
Mixin' up that perico, spread it on the table
My plug good, he mix the yayo, queso, queso, queso
My plug good, he mix the yayo, queso, queso, queso
My plug good, he mix the yayo, queso, queso, queso
My plug good, he mix the yayo, queso, queso, queso
