[Hook]
I would never be a sucker, kept it real
I could never trust a hoe, thats how I feel
And if they ain't talkin' money fuck a deal
I need at least like 2 M's like I'm Meek Mill
Like I'm Meek Mill, like I'm Meek Mill
I need at least like 2 M's like I'm Meek Mill
Like I'm Meek Mill, like I'm Meek Mill
Like I'm Meek Mill, like I'm Meek Mill
I need at least like 2 M's like I'm Meek Mill

[Verse 1]
Bout to be on top my city like Meek mill
And that chain I got on cost 50 like Meek Mill
And I might drive in my city inm a Aston, fuck that
Might cop that all gold Bentley like I'm Meek Mill (skrt skrt)
Don't give a fuck about a hater fuck how you feel
I'm up off this lean bout to pop me a pill (I am I am)
And I'm the only Philly nigga with a platinum grill
And I'm the only Philly nigga makin' these hits
(I'm makin' these hits)
I tell me a fuck nigga different level to with these shits

And a O to a 36 different level to these bricks
