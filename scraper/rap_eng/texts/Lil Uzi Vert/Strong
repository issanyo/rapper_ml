Zaytoven

[Intro: Lil Uzi Vert]
Gucci to the sock
Gucci to the sock
Gucci to the sock
Gucci to the sock, I just talked to Zay
I was on the block, he was on the way
They keep callin' my phone they trippin' (hello?)
Hello

[Chorus: Lil Uzi Vert]
I don't wanna talk, girl leave me 'lone (yeah)
I can't go outside, watch I come off strong
Can you hear me up? Please don't call my phone (hello)
I'ma count the guap, baby all alone, yeah
Now I'm all alone (ya), please don't call my phone
Stackin' all my bags, 'cause my money long
Not goin' out sad, man I'm comin' strong, ya

[Verse 1: Lil Uzi Vert]
Let's go, pop a rubber band make it rain, let's snow
When I'm in the field bitch I ball like Romo, yeah
All on my own, yeah, all on my phone
Girl, don't call on my phone
She in love with me, but that's your hoe
You say it's loyalty that's a no, no
Hit it on the screen, use the GoPro
Pull up on the scene with a .44
Tryna flex on me, that's a no-show
You ain't gettin' no guap, you got no shows
Rockin' Saint Laurent you got no clothes (skrrt)
You too dull (ya), rollin' loud

[Chorus: Lil Uzi Vert]
I don't wanna talk, girl leave me 'lone (yeah)
I can't go outside, watch I come off strong
Can you hear me up? Please don't call my phone (hello)
I'ma count the guap, baby all alone, yeah
Now I'm all alone (ya), please don't call my phone
Stackin' all my bags, 'cause my money long
Not goin' out sad, man I'm comin' strong, ya

[Verse 2: Lil Uzi Vert]
AP on my wrist, ice my watch
My phone keep on ringin', yeah it won't stop
Whip that pot, wrist on lock
Pull up drop, diamond water need a drop
Gucci to the socks, I just talked to Zay
I was on the block, he was on the way
He said "What you got?," "Zay we 'bout to get paid"
Zay said, "Money, that's all great but, but boy you better pray, ya
Boy you better pray 'cause no matter what you do you know your sins gon' wash away"
She ain't tryna give up, she won't get up out my face
I just count up 50s, got them hundreds on the way

[Chorus: Lil Uzi Vert]
I don't wanna talk, girl leave me 'lone (yeah)
I can't go outside, watch I come off strong
Can you hear me up? Please don't call my phone (hello)
I'ma count the guap, baby all alone, yeah
Now I'm all alone (ya), please don't call my phone
Stackin' all my bags, 'cause my money long
Not goin' out sad, man I'm comin' strong, ya
