[Verse 1]
Ready set go, um yeah
Got to give credit to God but I did this on my own
Playboi Carti what's your religion? He said its VLONE
I swear I'm VLONE
When I get older I swear I die alone
And on the real, don't nobody really wanna die alone
They really hatin' on me to get me out my zone
But they can not get me out my zone
Hey work her brain like it's mind control
We gon' make it rain, tell 'em bring some more
Lambo in the rain, yeah I lost control
Hit the front light and I smashed the door
And I looked down, still got my dough
Whew, neck on freeze, AP wrist on froze
Yeah swag OD and your lil bitch know it
Oh Vet' my T's, Raf Ricky from Dover
Got a centerpiece hanging on the chopper with the shoulder
Diamonds on my teeth

[Hook]
Ready, set, go
Gotta give credit to God but I did it on my own (um yeah)
Got a bad chick on my side and you know she gon' roll
Know I gotta stay on my toes
Ready, set, go, only thing that I know
Ready, set, go, ay, ay
Ready, set, go, ay, ay
Ready, set, go, wait

[Verse 2]
That's your new girl? Yeah had her last week
Felt like yesterday, what a fast week
Don't want to treat Brittney like Ashley
Yeah, treated her cool if you ask me
But that's only if you ask me
Found out she was cheating, what a bad dream
Bad dream, fighting through a bad dream
That girl ain't want me now she wanna lick me
Wanna caress me, now she wanna sex me
Tell that girl that I'm sorry, I'm already married
Yeah straight to the money
Make her tear up like onions, yeah
She take D just like Sunny
Swing from trees like a monkey
Want that tail like a pony
Want that tail like a horse
Pull that phone with my Rick Owens
Tell that girl one call I'm on it
Gotta watch the snake like a boa
Getting money, you know it
Make it rain and you know it
So much I need a mop

[Hook]
Ready, set, go
Gotta give credit to God but I did it on my own (um yeah)
Got a bad chick on my side and you know she gon' roll
Know I gotta stay on my toes
Ready, set, go, only thing that I know
Ready, set, go, ay, ay
Ready, set, go, ay, ay
Ready, set, go, wait
Ready, set, go, yeah-hey
