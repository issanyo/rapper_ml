I am a big fan of the um machine because

Pushing the Raf throw it off like a floater
Walking in with suit Goyard briefcase

They gettin' they clothes right from Ross
All of these diamonds are blessings
My teeth VVS's, I swear to god I only talk
Some of my niggas they blood and they crippin'
Feel like I'm Mr Cool its not my fault
Put on my necklace my bracelet
I swear I'm not basic I shine in the dark
Niggas know that my time comin'
I swear that I'm bubblin' like when snail hit the salt
Me and my old bitch we fell a part
Found a new bitch made her play her part
Racin' this Rari like Mario Kart
My diamonds yellow it lookin' like Voss
Straight to the ceiling I swear that I'm pimpin'
Whippin' Bentley, puttin' them scrimps in
