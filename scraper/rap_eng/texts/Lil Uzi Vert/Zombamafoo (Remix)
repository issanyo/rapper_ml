[Intro: Lil Yachty]
The fuck popping, Pablo?
You know what it is
Gang

[Verse 1: Lil Uzi Vert]
Chopper on me and you know that bitch folded
Pistol on me and you know that bitch loaded
Living my life just like everything golden
When I say that, I'm talking 'bout the Rollie
Nigga talk shit, put a hole in him slowly
Then I bag his bitch, fuck on that bitch slowly
Said you getting money, then you gotta show me
Know I'm a VLONE thug, bitch, I'm so lonely
Check it out, diamonds shine in the dark
Water ring look like VOSS
Fuck her once, break her heart
Skate on that girl like my name Tony Hawk
Had the swag from the start, had the shit in my car
Duck, I aim with the Moss-
Berg, so cold that my watch made me cough
I ain't never took a loss, keep it a hundred, of course
I pulled out that Lamb, no Honda Accord
I'll fuck your bitch and then I'll hit record
I took the Xan and then I'll hit the snore
Walk on the dead, bitch, I trip on the corpse
Counting the bands, but y'all mentioning Forbes
It felt like just yesterday, I was poor
Wake up, I'm swagging in Christian Dior

[Chorus: Hoodrich Pablo Juan]
I'm dressing like I was Zoboomafoo
Got lions and snakes on my Gucci shoes
Poured up a deuce, I rolled up a blunt or two
Your bitch wanna fuck when she come through
Sensei busting up bricks, I do kung-fu
Good aim when shooting, I'm hunting you
Caught a cold from my ice, ah-choo
All black Ghost pull up, peek-a-boo
I'm smoking that platinum cookies, that's the best
I got the juice, I pour up that Hitech
Four pockets full, looking like thigh pads
Talking that gangsta shit, no, you ain't 'bout that
Hoodrich, I keep the strap in my Louis bag
Fuck on your bitch, give her back, I'm through with that
Filthy rich like the sewer, don't hang with no rats
Designer my fashion, I'm still sippin' Act

[Verse 2: Lil Yachty]
Uh, check it out, check it out, check it, I check it
Give me that pussy and watch how I wreck it
Hundred thousand I just spent on my necklace
My big booty bitches share a crib in Texas
I used to hit scams and crack cards off the Nexus
I used to ride deep with my gang in the Lexus
I love all my women, Boat never a sexist
I prefer 'em sexy, all colors, I'm with it
I'm dressin' like I never had money
Fuckin' like I never had bunnies
And I'm buckin' like I never had trainin'
I mean Magic, we got that bitch straight rainin'
Not even legal
Not even legal, my whip Don Cheadle
In the lot, do donuts, Knievel
Next nigga hate, I'ma pay their tuition
'Cause I'm really havin' this paper
Young nigga hittin' them capers
I'm like Kobe with the Lakers
Never switch up on my squad (woo)
Had to buy a crib for the garage
Got a triple threat, that's a m√©nage
Her and her friend gave my dick a massage
Just fucked a bitch named Indigo
Ball like I play for the Florida State Seminoles

[Chorus: Hoodrich Pablo Juan & Lil Yachty]
I'm dressing like I was Zoboomafoo
Got lions and snakes on my Gucci shoes
Poured up a deuce, I rolled up a blunt or two
Your bitch wanna fuck when she come through
Sensei busting up bricks, I do kung-fu
Good aim when shooting, I'm hunting you
Caught a cold from my ice, ah-choo
All black Ghost pull up, peek-a-boo (peek-a-boo, peek-a-boo, peek-a-boo)
I'm smoking that platinum cookies, that's the best
I got the juice, I pour up that Hitech
Four pockets full, looking like thigh pads
Talking that gangsta shit, no, you ain't 'bout that Hoodrich
I keep the strap in my Louis bag
Fuck on your bitch, give her back, I'm through with that
Filthy rich like the sewer, don't hang with no rats
Designer my fashion, I'm still sippin' Act
