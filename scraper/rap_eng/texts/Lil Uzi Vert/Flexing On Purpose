I cannot ever be celibate

I been some places they never been
I asked 'em never compare me to rappers
I don't need the hassle, you know I'm a trapper
You what I'm after, you know I'ma get it
They said I couldn't but nigga I did it
Do you remember them callin' me trash?
Now I got trash bags of cash
I done got over more bumps than the rash
I can put all of these niggas on blast
I might not never get signed
I won't drop a dime that ain't on my kind
Tell 'em that I'm never retirin'
That shit is declined, I am on my grind
I got your bitch, she said that I'm better
She want me to settle
You bought her some shoes

They caught me with green, now they call me a Packer
Forgi's on the 'Vette, stagger
In my face I got a dagger
I catch your bitch and I'ma bag her
Get that mouth and bend her backwards
Get that mouth and then it's over
I grab that fork and beat the soda
