[Intro: Dave East & Lil Uzi Vert]
All I know is designer shit

Huh, you know we got all the money
All the money nigga (Yeah)

[Chorus: Lil Uzi Vert]
Tell that little nigga don't try me
Tell that little nigga don't try me
Saw his lil' bitch told her try me
Gave me that pussy won't buy it
All of my friends they won't buy this
Still the same nigga SLS, no Hyatt
Diamonds they water, Poseidon

[Verse 1: Lil Uzi Vert]
Run through the crowd I'm strident
Run that shit back on like two hoes
Yeah I might um get the Heismen

Why you hating, I'm filling my pockets
Everything I wear, yeah, is so rare
Blinded by my diamonds, yeah

Not bout the money then change the topic

While you hating I'm filling my pockets

[Chorus: Lil Uzi Vert]

[Verse 3: Dave East]
I dropped a fish in a pot
I drove a Benz out the lot
I got your bitch in the drop
Roll up a spliff by the cops
I got the grip in my coat
We send your bitch to the store
That foreign, I'm whipping it slow
Make her call my amigo go pick up the coke (Que lo que)
I'm in Saks Percocet in me
Instagram twitter niggas threaten me
They be jealousy they can't get next to me
I'm eating Lobster, on Cruise like Penelope
Kodak's no broccoli I'm on the celery
Goyard all over my luggage I'm jammin'
Grippin' on xannies im grippin', Iâ€™m screamin'
Diamonds on my wrists them bitches is dancin'
Panty-line showing them bitches tannin'
Tell that little nigga come try me
Pent house suite I don't stay at no Hyatt
Tell that little bitch I'ma freak
I watch what I eat like I'm on a diet
Your bitch treat me like I'm Trident
I feel like Clyde how I'm gliding
Bring out my name and we slidin'
Yeah, I got chased out of college
I never got no allowance
I wanted Polo and I wanted Prada
Mosqino casinos we doubled our dollars
I feel like Pacino I'm rolling with mobsters

[Chorus: Lil Uzi Vert]
Yeah, don't try me
Tell that little nigga don't try me
Yeah, don't try me
Tell that little nigga don't try me
Gave me that pussy won't buy it
All of my friends they won't buy this
Still the same nigga SLS, no Hyatt
Diamonds they water, Poseidon
Yeah, don't try me
Tell that little nigga don't try me
Yeah, don't try me
Tell that little nigga don't try me
Gave me that pussy won't buy it
All of my friends they won't buy this
Still the same nigga SLS, no Hyatt
Diamonds they water, Poseidon
