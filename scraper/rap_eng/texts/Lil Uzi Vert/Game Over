[Hook]
Pull up on the scene five bitches in the Rover
All my brother shooters all my niggas they my soldiers
Diamonds yellow looking like a motherfuckin' cobra
Run up on me wrong, boom boom
Game Over, Game Over, Game Over, Game Over, Game Over
In the beemer doing tricks
Game Over, Game Over
Got your bitch all on my dick
Game Over, Game Over
Copped a couple packs and I made a field
Game Over

[Verse 1: Lil Uzi Vert]
You cuffin that bitch, that just ain't my hoe
Look at my chain on that bitch I swear that is so froze
Look at my mouth in that snow
All of my paper is hunnits, I count my money um with my eyes closed
Damn, damn, damn, damn
Swervin' in a Range Rover
Switchin' lanes in a Range Rover
My IT is hot, chain smoker
Ten thousand for my chain choker
Can't remember last time I had plain soda
I don't sniff no blue, but you know I'm a cocaine hoe
Desert Eagle Blue, [?] show
Turn up with my wodies
We fuck all your hoes

[Verse 2: Rizzoo Rizzoo]
You fuck with me then it's over
Tony Montana we global
I cannot fuck with no local
My name is all on the poster
My bitch keep a gun in her coat
I cannot go back to broke
I be like 2k a show
Or fifteen for the snow
Drippin' in sauce, overflows
I got the game in the cold
I just be fuckin' these hoes [?] yellow brick road
Spillin' Lean on my clothes
[?]
It's hot like I'm over the stove
I like [?]
Spanish bitch she don't speak no inglo
Stacking Pesos like the [?]
Got a Puerto Rican bilingual
She need a green pass to be legal
I do a drive by in the Regal
Game over when I see you
Know some real niggas that claim blue
But most my niggas don't be fool
Game Over

[Outro]
I'm the best whether you like it or not
You're looking at the best looking man,the best dressed man
Long limousines
Jet air planes
Custom made clothes
And any woman in the world I want, just like that
You're nothing but the son of a plumber
You can't stand the fact that I was born with a golden spoon in my mouth can ya? Huh?
[?]
Riding around in that funky motorcycle
Why don't you get a Mercedes-Benz and be a real man? Huh?
You're all playing catch up ball to the natured boy
I don't care where you are in life, lets face it
If you're not carrying the big gold, you're second best no matter what you tell yourself. So gear up ladies and gentleman. Get used to it in Drip Flare
