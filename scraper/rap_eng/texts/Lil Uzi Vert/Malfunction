[Chorus]
No one wants to die alone
They don't wanna miss the show
It’s funny time missed us both
We all got time when we will go
Don't seem to be over
Seems to be over
Seems to be over
Seems to be over

[Verse 1]
They know she's mine ’cause I rule her
She says he does fine but I'm cooler
I got way more diamonds than your jeweler
All my girls dress like they work at Hooters
First I get my racks and then I backpack
No, I don't subtract, I might just add that
Did it on my own, no, you can't tax that
This that under the table, you can't track that

[Bridge]
Put money ahead and I move with the bread
But I do not need a toaster
Diamond, water, I'm the boatster
Pull up right there in the roadster
She ain't want me, I was so hurt
I was broke just like Joe Dirt
Where you from, throw it up, nigga
I'm from the lowest part of Earth

[Chorus]
No one wants to die alone
They don’t wanna miss the show
It’s funny time missed us both
We all got time when we will go
Don't seem to be over
Now it seems to be over
Seems to be over
Seems to be over

[Verse 2]
Over you, yeah
I got two so you know that I can’t lose ya
Moving my savages, you know my boys 'gone shoot, yeah
Came to the club on my solo tryna groove, yeah
Just keep on walking, it is nothing just to prove, yeah
Who him? His diamonds fake, and he can't fool us
You know it's Christian Dior all up on my shoes, yeah
White stripes on the arm of my Thom Browne suit
You know I pull up and I got my tool tucked
You know that I don’t go nowhere without my ruler
You know everything that I said was for the mula
I swear that me and your love's dead called the movers

[Chorus]
No one wants to die alone
They don't wanna miss the show
It's funny time missed us both
We all got time when we will go
Don't seem to be over
Seems to be over
Seems to be over
Seems to be over

[Bridge]
Put money ahead and I move with the bread
But I do not need a toaster
Diamond, water, I'm the boatster
Pull up right there in the roadster
She ain't want me, I was so hurt
I was broke just like Joe Dirt
Where you from, throw it up nigga
I'm from the lowest part of Earth

[Outro]
I told that girl pull up her skirt
I am so hot that I don't wear no shirt
Talk about me, you fuck 'round go get murked
Reject your bitch with my dick when she jerk
I hit it first, Lil Uzi Vert
Know I stay on alert
Know I stay on alert
Know I stay on alert
