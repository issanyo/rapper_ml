Cartel (x11)
I swear I love my cartel
They traffic it move it through mail
I swear I love my cartel
They traffic it move it through mail (x4)

[Verse 1]
My money is looking real well
And I would not sell my soul (no)
But I just worked like hell
And I been just sippin' a pint
And I’m been into a law, never holding me back
An op Never holding me down
These goofy ass niggas be clown
Until they get hit with the pound
They life flash before their eyes both
They fall to they face they mouth hit the ground
All my niggas be dogs, don't make me call up the hound
They will put you right down
They spitting them infamous rounds
We on top and you way under
Don't see a hater like I'm Stevie Wonder
Sixty racks top a brick thats a quick returner
Straight from the 99 Number One Stunna (ya heard me)
Hit her deep, thats my number one gunner
All year around we travel everyday is summer (In Miami)
Countin' big face hundreds, pockets big like 80 hummers
No child abuse when I whip the baby up

[Verse 2]
Whip it, diamonds like ATL benji
Blowing the cash all at Lennox
Whipping the white off the pigeon
Yeah the clip always extension
Codeine and Sprite got me dippin'
They throwin' your time now you snitchin'
Its crazy how bitches be bitchin'
The trap on the block got me richer
And she bounce the dick like she switches
Niggas talking they dissin'
My trigger finger just be itchin'
Yeah I got weight but ain't lifting
I switch positions they missing
Got bitch work at Onyx she stripping
Want me buy her shit but she trippin', she trippin'
On top of me jocking me sucking me properly actually sucking me sloppily
50 in hundreds my wrists'll be bopping
Got so much damn money I start speakin’ Guapense
Lettucce and broccoli bread with a lot of cheese
Honestly none of you niggas is hot as me honestly
None of you niggas is hot as me, bitches on my dick
And they just be jockin' me
Codeine and promethazine thats the dietary
Its lot of 'diene is always inside of me
Honestly when I die have a riot please
She keep on saying no but she keep eyeing me
I got so much guap and that bitch rely on me
I never cut a check and no I'm not lying B
No I'm not lying B,  no I'm not lying B
