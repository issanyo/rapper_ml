All these diamonds on me, could bought a Benz
I just fucked your girlfriend and fucked her friends
Gettin' money all the way to the end
Cartier, yeah that's all up on my lens
Went up to the church to wash all my sins
Went up to the preacher, wash all my sins
I pray to my soul to wash all my sins
Just to go wash all my sins

[Hook]
Ayy, just to go wash all my sins
Ayy, my girlfriend, she is a ten
Ayy, her girlfriend, she is a ten

Little bitch I swear you is not my main
Stuck to my dick just like glue

We own this shit and you still payin' rent
