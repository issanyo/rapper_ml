[Chorus]
Yah, it do not matter
Turned to a savage, pocket got fatter, she call me daddy
Smokin' that gas, gone off that Xanny, she on the powder
Nowadays I am on, my haters got sadder
Money got longer, speaker got louder, car got faster
Turned to a savage, pocket got fatter, she call me daddy
Smokin' that gas, gone off that Xanny, she on the powder
Nowadays I am on, my haters got sadder
Money got longer, speaker got louder, car got faster

[Verse 1]
Money so old, dollars spoiled
Yah, my lil bitch so spoiled
Yah, I rub her down in oil
Yah, I got money, now you know it
Yah, diamonds on my teeth
Yah, your shit look like foil
Yah, Chris Brown said these hoes ain't loyal
None of these hoes got no morals
All my niggas G'ed up
Yah, my glasses be Dita
Never thought it would be days I could kick my feet up
Never thought that she would need me that much if I leave her

[Chorus]
It do not matter
Turned to a savage, pocket got fatter, she call me daddy
Smokin' that gas, gone off that Xanny, she on the powder
Nowadays I am on, my haters got sadder
Money got longer, speaker got louder, car got faster
Turned to a savage, pocket got fatter, she call me daddy
Smokin' that gas, gone off that Xanny, she on the powder
Nowadays I am on, my haters got sadder
Money got longer, speaker got louder, car got faster
Turned to a savage, pocket got fatter, she call me daddy
Smokin' that gas, gone off that Xanny, she on the powder
Nowadays I am on, my haters got sadder
Money got longer, speaker got louder, car got faster

[Verse 2]
All of this was faction
No time for actin', all this money lastin'
Like, go out to eat, get that blackened salmon
When I'm wit' my girl, we Pharrell and Vashtie
Wait... huh? That mean we are not lastin'
In that pussy, you know I like it rough then I'm just blastin'
Yah, tell that lil bitch that I'm really from Mars
Uh, yah, bitch, do not start
Yah, pull up, my car automatic
Yah, uh, dealt with the star, yah!

[Chorus]
It do not matter
Turned to a savage, pocket got fatter, she call me daddy
Smokin' that gas, gone off that Xanny, she on the powder
Nowadays I am on, my haters got sadder
Money got longer, speaker got louder, car got faster
Turned to a savage, pocket got fatter, she call me daddy
Smokin' that gas, gone off that Xanny, she on the powder
Nowadays I am on, my haters got sadder
Money got longer, speaker got louder, car got faster
