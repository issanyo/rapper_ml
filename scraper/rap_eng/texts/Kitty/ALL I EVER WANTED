[Chorus]
I don't know what I'm supposed to say to you
I don't know how I'm supposed to make it through
Even if I could do it easily
All I ever wanted was to be
Close to you, close to you
Close to you, close to you
Close to you, close to you
All I ever wanted was to be close to you

[Verse 1]
Lately I don't know if I can make it
I'm dead broke, alone, watching HBO Go naked
I'm still sick, can't find the strength to change it
Nameless chalk body, face down on the pavement
My best known hobby is probably sobbing, honestly
Kicked out QuikTrip, or hanging out the car, vomiting
Finding new ways to bother anyone still tolerant
While whispering, "What's worse?" to the ghost that's still haunting me

[Chorus]
I don't know what I'm supposed to say to you
I don't know how I'm supposed to make it through
Even if I could do it easily
All I ever wanted was to be
Close to you, close to you
Close to you, close to you
Close to you, close to you
All I ever wanted was to be close to you

[Verse 2]
Small town tragedies we bury
In the passing of time and the shut down Chevron at night
Somewhere beyond resting rusted cars
Stone churches, sports bars, football team america
Dead pets buried in makeshift cemeteries
Under cherry trees or redbuds in bloom in spring
I am new to this, I am a virgin to the world again
And at the soft touch of her hand, I unfurl my wings

[Outro]
If we spin it all backwards, this never happens
You never hit me, I'm still laughing
Not sobbing with my head on the sand
& small tremors running through the cracks in my hand
Xxxxxx never stabbed, & I don't feel the absence
Xxxxxx passed along when he mixed his dope & Xanax
Xxxx sticks around for his kids first day of classes
Xxxx never takes that swan dive in manhattan
I'm not sobbing, I'm only laughing
I'm not crying, I'm just laughing
