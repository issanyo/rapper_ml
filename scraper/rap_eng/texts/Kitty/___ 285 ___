[Verse]
Shoulda given you a little head start
Out here, disappear like Elizabeth Smart
In a year I got a little more dark
You got a beard, I got a little more stark
White pale like a lily, you're a killer and I’m silly
We can chill and hear the bass, your lace, chantilly
You're as elegant as ever, I forget all of my etiquette
I bet you're gonna say “get away”, haven’t said it yet
What a bummer over summer
I been tryin' to forget and keep my head under the covers
Make it tougher when I see you under strobe lights
Oh right, you're the one I didn’t love enough
I wanna change but I know I’m never gonna baby
When I see you wave, wave I wanna run
I wanna jump up on you, I was okay, all fun
But you fuck it all up, I see your face and I’m done
I’m over it! It took all of my power to be
No control about how everybody’s down for you
Fist up like pound it dude!
And I’ll be runnin' off and hidin' in the powder room

[Pre-Chorus]
Never bitter, never soundin' rude
And positivity, I milk it like a cow, I moo
I can get the crowd to move, this is how I get the crowd to move
Never bitter, never soundin' rude
And positivity, I milk it like a cow, I moo
I can get the crowd to move, this is how I get the crowd to move
I’ll never get another chance, I wish
But all I wanna do is make you dance to this
Make you dance to this, and all I wanna do is make you dance

[Chorus]
We say goodbye, I guess
I will see you around
And I will clean up my mess
And I’ll never weigh you down
We say goodbye I guess
I will see you around
I will clean up my mess
And I’ll never weigh you down

[Bridge]
I been rubbin' velvet to remember your skin, and
The way you tell it, I am hell to be with
I need another round, I need another town
I need to get around, I need to block it out
Need to block it out, need to block it out, block it out out
I’ll never get another chance, I wish
But all I wanna do is make you dance to this

[Chorus]
We say goodbye, I guess
I will see you around
And I will clean up my mess
And I’ll never weigh you down
We say goodbye I guess
And I’ll never weigh you down
I’ll never weigh you down
I’ll never weigh you down
I’ll never weigh you down
I’ll never weigh you down
