I'll be your fool
Forever
As long as you adore me
Just promise to adore me
I'll be your girl
When I first tried it
It changed me
Now I'm eating cherries
Beneath a sycamore tree
I'm covered in roses
I'm ruby red
Baby, you changed me
I'm not over it

Oh, I love you
Oh, I do
No one could love you
Like I do
Oh, oh oh
