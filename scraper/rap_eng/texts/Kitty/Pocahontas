[Verse 1: Le1f]

Freaky fucking wit dat youngin, Pocahontas
Finna poke ya haunt ya. Cite the violations
Bum niggas from Mars, basic bitches from Venus
I’m from Murkury but I’m moving to Uranus
Put the bass near my brain and I’ll murk the beat
I'mma work the feet, twerk the knees, jump that booty, do the thing
I’ll ride your dude like Pegasus
Make him call me hercules cuz now he’s my main squeeze
What the game is? You already know
Shorty, he just wanna see me hit that floor
I’m a black belt with the twerkwondo
Plus, my legs stay sore cuz I dip it too low

[Hook: Le1f]

Bad bitch, bad bitch, do your thing
I just wanna see that hair swing
Pocahontas
Can you paint with all the colors of the wind?
On the dancefloor, we gettin’ it in
Shorty want it

[Verse 2: Kitty]

I’m from Venus but I'm comin in peace
And I need the immediate no extended release, but
I'm obedient, I got a policeman
Commending all the grease from my elbows and
Tell me cease, I say hell no
Could you tickle me? I'm Elmo, and
I'm out here harshin all your mellows, and
I'm a Martian, you can tell when I jiggle it like jello

[Hook: Kitty]

Bad bitch, bad bitch, do your thing
I just wanna see that hair swing
Pocahontas
Can you paint with all the colors of the wind?
On the dancefloor, we gettin’ it in
Shorty want it

[Hook: Le1f]

Bad bitch, bad bitch, do your thing
I just wanna see that hair swing
Pocahontas
Can you paint with all the colors of the wind?
On the dancefloor, we gettin’ it in
Shorty want it
