[Chorus]
Hey, I just met you and this is crazy
But here's my number, so call me maybe
And all the other boys try to chase me
But here's my number, so call me maybe

[Verse 1]
I'm a quarter of Four Loko down
And I'm really very stoked that you came around
And I'm trying on my poker face
And I don't know how to stay expressionless, I didn't wanna mention this
But I'm crushing on you like bench presses
Trying to confess this, causing quite a mess it's
Stressful and all the rest of your friends look very unimpressed with me
And I'm not the hottest, but I'm fully employed
And it's 11:11 when I unlock the droid
I wish upon a digital clock to stop the void
That increases in depth whenever my heart is toyed with
And I wanna get it, shorty, like I'm Wayne & Lloyd
Like breaking down the ford
I am unavoidable, I trail far enough behind
Keep you from getting paranoid and I am
An itty bitty lightweight, I stay by
On the realization that you're impatient, so I wait
And when you pass by me, I might faint
Quick I need to lie, great
Say I need to hydrate
But I'm just faded and that really wasn't clever
I'd say, "Call me maybe," but you'll probably call me never
I wait forever and ever and ever, whatever

[Chorus]
Hey, I just met you and this is crazy
But here's my number, so call me maybe
And all the other boys try to chase me
But here's my number, so call me maybe

[Post-Chorus]
Before you came into my life I missed you so bad
I missed you so bad, I missed you so, so bad
Before you came into my life I missed you so bad
And you should know that, so call me maybe

[Verse 2]
Yeah, I'm dead and I wanna cuddle in your bed
Always dreads, never braids
And my brain, you make it mushy like the Everglade
I won't get pushy cause I'm wussy, easily persuaded
And I'm faded now, but I'm never late
Never laid, always playin'
All the other boys would try to chase it and evade 'em
But I wouldn't play, cause I believe in fate and

[Chorus]
Hey, I just met you and this is crazy
But here's my number, so call me maybe
And all the other boys try to chase me
But here's my number, so call me maybe

[Post-Chorus]
Before you came into my life I missed you so bad
I missed you so bad, I missed you so, so bad
Before you came into my life I missed you so bad
And you should know that, so call me maybe

[Outro]
I missed you so so bad
I missed you
So give me scabies
Give me scabies
