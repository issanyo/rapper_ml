[Intro]
Wide ruled in between lines
Full name, blue pen, I'll sign
In between lines
Full name, blue pen on a big black line
I can wait forever
I can wait forever

[Verse]
You're throwin' your shade, it's another puddle to wade
I decline a nug of your dank if you're gonna offer it
I shake 'em with the hand that I'm coughin' in
Baby I said a lot of shit, dug a ditch in it I'ma fit a coffin in
I thought I heard 'em scoffin' at the false things I'm bloggin'
I've been promisin' my mom I'm doin' great
I've been off a klonopin wobblin', I'm all up in the offices
Cause I wanna get an offer but I'll wait
As long as it'll take
And I'm probably gonna make it
All fake so I don't end up involvin' my drama
And I do all of the talkin', I'm Mia Wallace, I got it
I know I already bodied 'em baby, already fathered 'em
Like I'm Hank, callin' all of 'em Bobby
And I've been Plank to all of the Johnnies
And they been draggin' me in their little red wagon
And mad at all of my flaws
I tried erasin' them off of me but

[Hook]
I can wait forever if I get what I want
I can take the weather if I'm sweaty and hot
But when I'm cold I get over it and I'm over it now
And I don't owe it to nobody yet, but oh, I've been down
I got a body to market, I got a soul I can sell
Keep missin' my target, it's gettin' cold in my cell
Not gonna piss on the carpet, not gonna roll on the ground
I got an eye on the competition, I'm mowin' 'em down
I can wait forever if I get what I want
I can take the weather if I'm sweaty and hot
But when I'm cold I get over it and I'm over it now
And I don't owe it to nobody yet, but oh, I've been down
I got a body to market, I got a soul I can sell
Keep missin' my target, it's gettin' cold in my cell
Not gonna piss on the carpet, not gonna roll on the ground
I got an eye on the competition, I'm mowin' 'em down

[Outro]
Wide ruled in between lines
Full name, blue pen, I'll sign
We can celebrate it, poppin' white wine
I got all the cadence, keep it on time
I got all the rays, I'ma be your sunshine
Makin' raisins out of all the grapes then
Anything you want, anything, you say when
I just wanna write full name, blue pen on a big black line
I can wait foreverrrrrrr……
