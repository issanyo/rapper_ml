Is the door closed? Are you keeping focus?
Are you Moses? Are you why I'm inside of this swarm of locusts?
And if so, can you walk on the red seas
And see into the dark and make it light again, please, please, please
Prince of Egypt prince of Persia prince of Paris
You’re the prince of Champagne and sunnin' on the terrace
You’re the prince of bubble bath, the crush i have is terrifying
Suffer but i bear it, I know love will tear us
Apart
Again
Cuz you’re nailing me to the wall, you shackle me like a slave
I’m failing I feel you fall of the back of me like a wave
Like an impala so fast on the interstate
I’m mad that you say you’ll call but you bastard, you make me wait
I pissed on you like a mastiff, you’re the hydrant
Raise your mast with my flag on it like a pirate
I’m a good girl with a masters in wasting time
And I feel like the pearl being cast among all the swine
But the sky turned light blue when we were inside
And I don’t mind, you say to spend the night-
Too late, cuz the sky’s already light blue
