You’re such a con, keep telling stories
I want you gone, it’s getting boring
I’ll cut the ropes, the rope ropes
Cause you’re a hoax, a ho-hoax

You look angelic but you’re devil-made
Send a message from your number that I'll never save
I’ll help you tuck your tail between your legs
I’ll bet you’ll never mess with me again, cause

You got a lotta pretty girls caught up in your games
Cause you wear nice sweaters and you got a lot of fame and
Wave hi like you’re doing me a favor, big band boy in your big backstage
Quit telling everybody that you know, that you know know know me, no you don’t
Quit telling everybody that you know, that you know know know me, no no no

Settle down and get all comfy in your throne
Cause it’s never gonna happen boy, that jet’s already flown
Don’t sweat it cause you know you won’t be lonely
But you gotta quit pretending that you know me

You’re such a con, keep telling stories
I want you gone, want you gone, gone
I’ll cut the ropes, I'll cut the rope ropes
Cause you’re a ho-ho-ho-hoax

These bugs love all the sugar in my blood and you’re one, you’re one (x8)

You’re such a con, keep telling stories
I want you gone, it’s getting boring
I’ll cut the ropes, the rope ropes
Cause you’re a hoax, a ho-hoax
