Their stares level me, the devil made me do it
When really I've been craving for days to misbehave with you
And I know if we're caught you're not the type to save me
But I'll be brave, and take the blame if we can misbehave
Their stares level me, the devil made me do it
When really I've been craving for days to misbehave with you
And I know if we're caught you're not the type to save me
But I'll be brave, and take the blame if we can misbehave

A scapegoat, I'll tell em it was me
When we stole your brother's car with the little rubber key
And my mother, she'll blubber to the fuzzes and she'll plea
"He's the bad seed, it wasn't my Kathryn-Leigh" please
Pardon me, but I did it
I'm more mischievious than previously thought and I'll admit it
And the minute that you dare me to, I'm scared but I'm committed
Call me square, it isn't fair how bad you make me wanna fit in
It's hazardous, the magic of your smirk
And the spell that I have fell in makes me kind of a jerk and
I'd hit a felony to see that smile, and if you laugh
I'll kick the neighbors leaves right out of their piles
The fences that you make me jump, the hikes you make me hitch
And the bikes you make me ride so you can skitch
I'm like, it makes me itch to disobey, you say "don't be a little bitch"
Which I shouldn't be okay with but we're dingin-dongin-ditchin
And I was gonna snitch until you turned on your charm
And it's the bully sort I'd pull like forty fire alarms for
You know I'm wooly soft, I'm not very hard
So you pull me when we're runnin from security guards, their stares
Level me, the devil made me do it
When really I've been craving for days to misbehave with you
And I know if we're caught you're not the type to save me
But I'll be brave, and take the blame if we can misbehave

Their stares level me, the devil made me do it
When really I've been craving for days to misbehave with you
And I know if we're caught you're not the type to save me
But I'll be brave, and take the blame if we can misbehave
Their stares level me, the devil made me do it
Expel me or sue, I'll never tell em it was you
Their stares level me, the devil made me do it
Expel me or sue, I'll never tell em it was you
