[Verse 1: Antwon]
Antwon came swaggier than most
White people love me like chipped beef on toast
I coast with the ghost smell of nectarines
The truth with the saber-tooth; Victor Creed
Black and brown people putting they faith in me
Down the bill which up just please have weed
Came with the dutchy nigga had to scheme
But a nigga so cosy, smoke weed, and scary dreams
Nigga, I'm barely seen
A nigga touch my face, his whole team bleed
These niggas want beef, but they say it on Tumblr
So what's that make you, motherfucker?
(Half-dead, motherfucker!)

[Bridge: Antwon & Kitty]
I got weed on me
No you don't, stop
I got cocaine on me
You're gonna get me in trouble
I'm on probation, nigga
No!
And I smoke weed too, nigga, what's up

[Verse 2: Kitty]
No, mom
Don't listen to 'twon
Nobody has cocaine on em and I never do anything wrong, kay?
She's always so suspicious, lurking kittydothedishes
It's the business, so why you wanna witness
The innocence I assassinate with rings up in my cartilage?
A yard I bring the boys to, I don't need a guardian
To keep me in the party dress I started in
The yellow with the polka dots
'twon, can you teach me how to smoke a pot?
But I been runnin yellow lights
And makin sure that every thing I type I fuckin' spell it right
And learning how to blur out all my cellulite
And write about how bad I wanna have a cinderella night
So I can make a frog a prince
And the audience has always got a sprinkle of
Bitches that I wanna pinch and
Wanna punch em in their stupid face
But I'm busy rapping super bass
In the passenger seat
And if you're passing on me
My pack of backup'll be cracking your teeth
And you'll be smacking your lips
And i'll be laughing while they're ashing their cigs
Out of the back of my whip
Cuz I beez the DDs
No weaving in and out
And never ever speeding
Scouts honor mama
Scouts honor, mama!
I never get in trouble
Mom I love ya
