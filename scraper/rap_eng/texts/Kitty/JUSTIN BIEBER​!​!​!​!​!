[Hook]
Justin Bieber on my notebooks and my pens
Justin Bieber is my very best friend
Justin Bieber posters, I pretend he's kissin me
Justin Bieber bulbs on my Christmas tree
Justin Bieber's initials on all my winter clothes
Justin Bieber needs to take me out to dinner, though
Justin Bieber is my personal savior
And, Lord, he can afford me, it's not a favor

[Verse 1]
Boys are like milk, they expire if you're late on em
It's legal for me, man I don't even have to wait on em
Catch me at the middle school, chattin up skateboarders
I hoard high school sophomores that want whores
And listen to hardcore, I drive em to the show
And if I lose em in the pit then fuck it, let's just go
Cover my ears every time the damn beat drops
I'm thirteen, what is lean, and what is dream pop?
Scared in the backseat when they need to make a weed stop
And if they catch me I'll just cry for all the mean cops
I like em sixteen with bleached hair and supreme tops
And dirty ass vans on their feet, flop over
Belly up, don't preach pops, I'm on top if he looks like bieber
I'll teach lots, and he gots lovin', so remember that

[Verse 2]
I keep his picture on my homescreen, "Kitty, you need a life"
I'm not kidding when I say I'm gonna be his damn wife
Like I'm really gonna marry him, and it'll be nice
Like RiFF RaFF, bitch, they're gonna throw out the rice
Drive off in the just married, it'll suffice
If we just run over selena twice, right?

[Bridge]
Justin Bieber says to never say never
So I'm never gonna quit, I'm gonna love him forever
And ever and whether or not I hit it just depends on whether
He decides to respond to my letters
Justin Bieber says to never say never
So I'm never gonna quit, I'm gonna love him forever
Forever and ever
We're gonna be together

[Outro]
This is, the enlightened one
The first sermon from the first National Church of Bieber
Everything is purple
Everything is purple
Everything is purple
This is the gospel of the new covenant
