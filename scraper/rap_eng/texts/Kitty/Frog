The frog in my throat well it's holding down the truth behind 99% of my joking like the times I invite you over to choke it out

And every single time you decline and I try to joke about it. I got a fire that you can stoke and now I’m Kanye after accidents I'm lying down wired up with a broken mouth

I wanna lay you down and jus' poke around you hear what I spoke aloud and say, louder, I see your outer facade and it’s brittle, you fiddle with me a little, I'm little but I can jiggle and juggle but I admit it you puzzle me like a riddle, I might as well nibble on the bits n' kibbles cause you're dogging me and the frog in my throat is gonna croak, I wanna get over you I want out of the fog that I've been cloaked in

Cause you're fucking raw, you're dropping jaws in the streets watch it, you’re fucking raw as the streets, I see your outer shell and it's brittle you fiddle with me a little, I'm little but I can jiggle and juggle but I admit it you puzzle me like a riddle, I might as well nibble on the bits and kibbles cause you're dogging me and the frog in my throat is gonna croak, I wanna get over you I want out of the fog and I thought I wanted to be tied up and clawed at, but I’m a fraud I’m really terrified of all that

So I take it slow do a great job (Tim & Eric) but I always was a terrible judge of character, all you wanna do is tear it up, I know but can't you be noble like Captain America? I wanna stare at ya I wanna stare at ya I wanna stare at ya I wanna stare at ya I wanna…

I wanna sit and stare atcha I wanna sit and stare atcha like the streets watch I wanna go home with you and see your 3 socks strewn around your bedroom 6 AM I gotta jet soon, leave locks of my hair around your restrooms and I need 2 find peace, spas to chill in steam rooms full of heat rocks

I don' want you I just need 2 detox and I don't want you I just need a detox
