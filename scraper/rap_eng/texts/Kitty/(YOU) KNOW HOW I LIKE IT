[Intro: Dan Windsor]
You choose our time
You like my room

[Chorus: Dan Windsor]
Know you don't know where I've been
But you know how I like it
And you said it would save us
You say you're not okay so I play dumb

[Verse: Sam Ray]
Something makes me cry
But I don't know why
Lately, I don't feel strong enough
To pick myself up from the floor
In the bed or in the car, falling apart in your arms
Ashamed of what I can't quite figure out
Any time, night or day, home or hundreds of miles away
I'm still caught between each corner of your room

[Chorus: Dan Windsor]
Know you don't know where I've been
But you know how I like it
We should care if it kills us
For a thrill in a dream makes us sleep better

[Outro: Sam Ray]
"It's not enough for me
But should it even be?"
"It's not enough for me
But should it even be?"
"It's not enough for me
But should it even be?"
"It's not enough for me
But should it even be?"
