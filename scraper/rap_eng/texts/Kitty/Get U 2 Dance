[Verse 1: Kitty]
Feelin' low, but I can't hold back no more
Is this what you wanted, to lock me out the door
I'm in a rut, I'm giving up, I know it's just my luck, but
Won't you come over, 'cause you know that I adore

[Pre-Chorus: Boy Sim]
The way you walk, it kills me
And the way you talk, it thrills me
The way you look, the way you smile
I wanna go the extra mile
I know I messed up, yeah
And I know I fucked up, yeah
You're still my baby
Though I know you hate me

[Chorus: Boy Sim; Kitty & Boy Sim]
But if I get you to dance
Would you dance all night
Just give me a chance
And we can make it all alright
'Cause I don't want anything else
And maybe we're going to hell
If I get you to dance
I would dance all night with you

[Verse 2: Kitty]
So many promises broke
So many problems I know
I know I'm causing the pain and the drama
But I'ma be honest, I'm so done
Crumbling under the pressure
Never again, I mean never
So hold onto me, don't let go baby please
You gotta believe me when I tell you

[Pre-Chorus: Kitty & Boy Sim; Boy Sim]
The way you walk, it kills me
And the way you talk, it thrills me
The way you look, the way you smile
I wanna go the extra mile
I know I messed up, yeah
And I know I fucked up, yeah
You're still my baby
Though I know you hate me

[Chorus: Kitty & Boy Sim; Boy Sim]
But if I get you to dance
Would you dance all night
Just give me a chance
And we can make it all alright
'Cause I don't want anything else
And maybe we're going to hell
If I get you to dance
I would dance all night with you
With you
With you, yeah
With you
'Cause I don't want anything else
And maybe we're going to hell
If I get you to dance
I would dance all night with you

[Bridge: Kitty]
I'll dance all night (I'll dance all night)
I'll dance all night (I'll dance all night)
With you
I'll dance all night
I'll dance all night (I'll dance all night)
I'll dance all night (I'll dance all night)
I'll dance dance dance dance dance dance dance

[Chorus: Boy Sim & Kitty]
But if I get you to dance
Would you dance all night
Just give me a chance
And we can make it all alright
'Cause I don't want anything else
And maybe we're going to hell
If I get you to dance
I would dance all night with you
With you (with you)
With you, yeah
With you (with you, with you)
'Cause I don't want anything else
And maybe we're going to hell
If I get you to dance
I would dance all night with you
