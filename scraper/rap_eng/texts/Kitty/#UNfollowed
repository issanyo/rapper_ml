[Verse 1]
I didn't wanna do it but I caved and I'm bitter that I blew it
So I saved your digits so I hit him up at parties and at raves
And I said "I'm sorry for my art, it's in my heart"
And it's based like a God, like a bitch, like a Martian
I only start shit when I get Bacardi and I'm brave, I mean
I heartily forgave you for lying but I'm pretty sure I'm dying
And my room is like a grave, and
I am relating to Aaliyah 'cause you say you're gonna leave her but you ain't
And I've been patiently waiting since the day that you asked
But your mom would have a problem if we date

[Chorus]
And, so, what then?
Should I just blubber to my friends and let them say "FUCK MEN!"
By that, they mean you, how rude, fuck them, right?
So, what should I expect?
So, what then?
Should I just blubber to my friends and let them say "FUCK MEN!"
By that, they mean you, how rude, fuck them, right?
So, what should I expect?

[Verse 2]
And I can tell I'm agitating you with all the badgering I do
You're unattached, I kinda knew, but I just
I want to let it past and get it through
How's it getting all the ass I know you do?
And I'll admit the stalker thing's a pretty bad plan
But I'm just a little girl and you're a grown ass man
So like, I know how to handle you
Fucking with the kid you say you want to lend your hand to
But she's a hottie, I can't even hold a candle
I could've gave her Twitter to me, could've used her handle
Said, "you're prettier but could you lend your man to me?"
And evaded a whole scandal
This isn't what I planned, you're more demanding that I thought
And I am flakier than dandruff
I want to hold your hand and look outlandish together
And just perpetuate propaganda

[Chorus]
And, so, what then?
Should I just blubber to my friends and let them say "FUCK MEN!"
By that, they mean you, how rude, fuck them, right?
So, what should I expect?
So, what then?
Should I just blubber to my friends and let them say "FUCK MEN!"
By that, they mean you, how rude, fuck them, right?
So, what should I expect?

[Verse 3]
I know the stalker thing's a pretty bad plan
But I'm just a little girl and I'm your number one fan
And everybody tells me you're a grown ass man but, like
I know how to handle you
The stalker thing, it was a pretty bad plan
But I'm just a little girl and I'm your number one fan
So, I know how to handle you
Fucking with the kid you say you want to lend your hand to
My fans enable me and kissing your butt
And like everybody little kiss is a publicity stunt
You say, "Kitty is you trickin', or what?"
I'm a flinch and I'm a stick in the mud
All I talk about is rhymes, though
'Cause what is there to say when we're sleeping in different time zones?
Fucking tour from California, Vermont
And like "ooh ooh ooh, you’re the one that I want"
We talk a little, but eventually stop so
You’re the one that I want
Why the fuck are you the one that I want?
