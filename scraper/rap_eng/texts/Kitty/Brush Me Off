[Chorus: Kitty]
I say I wanna take you home but I love it when you say no
I love it when you brush me off, and it’s so often
I say I wanna take you home but I love it when you say no
I love it when you brush me off, brush me off, brush me off

[Verse 1: Kitty]
I say I wanna take you home, everybody here knows
Everybody hears me yellin' when I’m tellin' you to come over
But you’re giving me that cold shoulder
Over and over, and over and over (and over)
Do I embarrass you boy? You know I’m thirsty
I’m never scared anymore even though you'll hurt me
You know I’m desperate, your destiny, you desert me
And baby I’ll be the best and you don’t deserve me
But I’m calling you at 3am, and 3:13
And 3:26, and 3:39, and 3:45, and 4:14
And you still screen 'em

[Pre-Chorus: Kitty]
Put your hands up if you get the thumbs down
Put your hands up if you get the thumbs down
Put your hands up if you get the thumbs down
Put your hands up, put your hands up

[Chorus: Kitty]
I say I wanna take you home but I love it when you say no
I love it when you brush me off, and it’s so often
I say I wanna take you home but I love it when you say no
I love it when you brush me off, brush me off, brush me off

[Verse 2: Sad Andy]
I can tell by your eyes, how your pullin on my sweater
How ya follow me around, you can see us together
I know it seem fucked up 'cause i show no love
Hate to sound sleazy, tease me, I don’t wanna make this that easy
I can’t kick it tonight, I’ma hit you in the morning
Don’t act all upset 'cause I front on sext
Don’t feel special, other women I’m ignorin', and
The rain keeps pourin', I’ll be home in a minute
Can’t wait 'til you finish, just wanted you to listen
No text message, the feelin that’s missin'
Cupcake no fillin', I ain’t got time cuz I got a lotta women
I mean who are we kiddin'? Once I get it I’m dippin'
I guess my mind ain’t right, I can’t be the one that you’re holdin'
But if I ever change my mind, you better bust it open in Oakland
(Nature!)

[Chorus: Kitty]
I say I wanna take you home but I love it when you say no
I love it when you brush me off, and it’s so often
I say I wanna take you home but I love it when you say no
I love it when you brush me off, brush me off, brush me off
I say I wanna take you home but I love it when you say no
I love it when you brush me off, and it’s so often
I say I wanna take you home but I love it when you say no
I love it when you brush me off
