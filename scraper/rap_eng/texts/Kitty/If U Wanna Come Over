[Intro]
Dreams, dreams

[Verse 1]
Keep me in the dark, that’s my policy
If you never tell me anything about it, never need apologies
Usually I keep it all inside and assume you’ll be using me
If you do, it’s fine, nothing new

[Pre-Hook]
We don’t have to make plans early
I’m leaving all the doors unlocked for you now
Creep up in around 4:30
Wake up in the morning, let yourself out

[Hook]
When I’m without you I’ll forget about you
You’ll forget about me too (about me too)
Till' I’m out here in your part of town
Yeah, baby this is how we do (this is how we do)
You got me fucked up (dreams) fucked up, baby
Fucked up (dreams) fucked up, baby

[Verse 2]
You’re black and yellow butterflies, all the things I like
I make fun of like everybody other than you
Only way to summarize
Come alive on Exit 11 on another drive
I shouldn’t be texting, but I do for you

[Pre-Hook]
I don’t really feel like leaving
I already know you’ll wanna go out
So enjoy your evening
If you wanna come by, I’m always down

[Hook]
When I’m without you I’ll forget about you
You’ll forget about me too (about me too)
Till' I’m out here in your part of town
Yeah, baby this is how we do (this is how we do)
When I’m without you I’ll forget about you
You’ll forget about me too (about me too)
Till' I’m out here in your part of town
Yeah, baby this is how we do (this is how we do)
You got me fucked up (dreams) fucked up, baby
Fucked up (dreams) fucked up, baby

[Outro]
Fucked up, fucked up, baby
Fucked up, baby
Fucked up, fucked up, baby
Fucked up, baby
This is how we-
