[Verse 1]
Turn it up until the neighbors are yellin' (I got that boom)
So I know that if you’re hatin', you're jealous (I got that boom)
And I know that just by lookin’, you tell it (they call me "Mom")
'Cause they know that I've been cookin', they smell it (they call me "Mom")

Uh, I think it's fun
I love all my daughters, I love all my sons
And fuck a label if you ain't either one
I got a room and a table so come on, let's get drunk

[Pre-Chorus]
I got that boom, I got that boom
I got that boom, I got that, that, that
I got that boom, boom, boom
I got that boom, boom, boom
I got that boom, boom, boom

[Chorus]
I got that boom, boom, boom
I got that boom, boom, boom
I got that boom, boom, boom
I got that boom, boom, boom

[Post-Chorus]
Check out my boyfriend and my other boyfriend
And his other girlfriend and her other boyfriend
Check out my girlfriend and her other girlfriend
And her other boyfriend

[Verse 2]
I'm like a meteor shower
I got the green and the power
Damn, I look clean and proud
Everyone’s tweeting about it
I post a pic and it’s lit
You tap it twice to favorite it
I know you like it and print it
And I know why, 'cause I bring it

I got that boom, turn it up until they call the police
I got that boom, you can hear us through the wall on the street
I’m gonna hit, you don't even wanna compete
I'm in this bit', and I ain’t got nothing on underneath

[Chorus]
I got that boom, boom, boom
I got that boom, boom, boom
I got that boom, boom, boom
I got that boom, boom, boom

[Post-Chorus]
Check out my boyfriend and my other boyfriend
And his other girlfriend and her other boyfriend
Check out my girlfriend and her other girlfriend
And her other boyfriend

[Outro]
I'm like a m-
I'm like a m-
