[Verse 1]
Could you wrap your hands all the way around my neck
And tell me where I stand
Tell me everything I’m wrecking when I spin
Take over my breath, in out in, I am missing you to death
And could you wrap your hands all the way around my neck
And tell me where I stand
Tell me everything I’m wrecking when I spin
Take over my breath, in out in, I am missing you to death

[Verse 2]
And I was super positive and you were stupid dope
And now you’re the loop of rope I hung up in my stupid closet
I've been acting stupid a lot saying you caused it
And I been living off it as modest as royalties you deposit
I spin, this world you're in, this world you’re in

[Chorus]
You’re all poised and I’m made of poison
(I’m a cyclone, cyclone, cyclone, cyclone)
You’re all poised and I’m made of poison
(I’m a cyclone, cyclone, cyclone, cyclone)
You’re all poised and I’m made of poison
(I’m a cyclone, cyclone, cyclone, cyclone)
You’re all poised and I’m made of poison
(I’m a cyclone, cyclone, cyclone, cyclone)

[Verse 3]
I’m up at night over shit I said and forgot about
You’re the spider, I’m tired of being waterspout
You’re too tiny to climb me, I wanna settle down and be fine
And with time you’ll forget about me
And let me go. Let me go, let me go, let me go
I said a lot and I’m probably terrible for it
I’m all taken care of, I don’t even compare the two of us
I walk around and stare, I wanna sit and stare
I never wanna care, I never wanna care, I’m on another level
Just forget about the elephants in rooms that I’m never in
I’m thinking I was doomed, I would never win

[Bridge]
You’re like a petit-four, sweet sweet sweet
You shoulda never settled down with me me me
I sing a metaphor on beat, beat, beat
I’ll see you nevermore…
I’m tappin' on your window pane
You left me, I woulda did the same
You can find shelter under your umbrella, eh eh
I’m tappin' on your window pane
You left me, I woulda did the same
You can find shelter under your umbrella, eh eh

[Chorus]
You’re all poised and I’m made of poison
You’re all poised and I’m made of poison
You’re all poised and I’m made of poison
You’re all poised and I’m made of poison
