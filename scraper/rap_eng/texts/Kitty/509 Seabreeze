[Verse 1]
You come in at five today, and I’ll be here waiting
Be together miles away from where you belong
You’re in your fashion, all black, I can’t fuck with all that
I’m in my plastic straw hat, dancing to my favorite song
You say you love the sunrise, I like it too
And sometimes I stay up and wait to see it
I’ll come by your tiny room and show you how we do

[Hook]
At least we know we’ll be together
At least we know I’ll give you my heart
A week or so till' the end of the summer
Nothing’s gonna break us apart
At least we know (at least we know)

[Verse 2]
You got your 2010 Audi, now you’re gonna take it
Down to pick your townie up and get her wasted
And get loud, you love to vacation, you love the sound of the bass
And the waves are crashing softly, clapping to the wrong beat
When you go back home, aw, please don’t forget to call me
You got your Wayfarers on to shade from nothing
The rain and hurricanes are coming soon
So lay with me right under that moon and I’ll let you touch me

[Verse 3]
You’re looking pretty under the mosquito net
I wanna smoke another of your cigarettes
You said you only got one left
And they’re cheaper down here than they are back west
So you think you’re gonna miss it when you go
Palm trees, salt breeze, baby, listen to it blow
I think it’s so ironic how you’re taking your holiday
Exactly where I wish I could escape from

[Hook]
At least we know we’ll be together
At least we know I’ll give you my heart
A week or so till' the end of the summer
Nothing’s gonna break us apart
At least we know

[Verse 4]
Humidity, Florida heat (Isn't it sweet) And you’re into me
You say home is so boring, you don’t wanna leave here
The rest of the year, I won’t go anywhere
I’ll be right here when you’re back
It’s crackin', I’ll show you all the action, you know
I’ll show you all the action, you know, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
