I've got a couple brothers
So I know how to be tough
But to be quite honest
I've had enough

Of my exes that call me
And say they're still in love
I just shake my head and say
Wow, that sounds rough

Then they get all mad
Call me a whore again
I'll go back to your birthday
Kick your ass with the DeLorean

And Marty can have shotgun
I'm so happy I could die
Never found a man
That can love me like McFly

Maybe he'll let me take his board
We'll have a ride
And we'll do the jitterbug
Like it's 1955

Then we'll go back down
To Riverside Drive
Give Doc Brown tips
On how to stay alive

Maybe I would save you
From a Libyan drive-by
And as for Jennifer
We'll let that bitch die

And anyone who says you're
Chicken, baby, they're telling lies
Come down and show me
Your purple Calvin Kleins

Anyway I think I met him
In the sky
Like whoa, this is heavy
But we're both the same size

And angel
Would you be my small fry?
And Johnny couldn't be as good as you
McFly

I know you didn't need sugar
Or caffeine
To hype you up
Because baby, you have me

And maybe if you
Took me camping
We could change the end
Of the last two movies
