C'mon yeah, we're scaring
We're going to bad and say bad evil things
I'm swagging bitch, I'm iced up
I'm swagging bitch, I'm iced up
Swag bitch, I'm iced up
Bitch, we're incredible

Hey mommy ?
I'm trying to forget this idiot who keeps doing me wrong
He only responds when I talk about satan on the blog
And the pictures of the reaper, jiggling asses, and thongs
I'm sorry I don't have that cause I don't even own one
I'm not the queen of fashion, but I'm sitting on the throne

? the bruises, I said don't worry about it
But I like more so please hurry and he was about it
So we spent like thirty seconds being flirty, getting sweaty
And I regret it
I mean I liked it but I wasn't ready

I guess I didn't want him around me but I'm a softy
So I let him call me and buy me coffees at my work
My job is just to flirt and sell glitter
So make your skirt a little shorter, Kitty, don't be a quitter

I'm not so sure that we're all alone here
I think I'm in love with everyone
I'm not so sure that we're all alone here
I think I'm in love with everyone

But I'm really not
I'm really rotting on a swing set
Repeatedly every Monday as I wonder why my mommy's so mean to me
And then Tuesday I said you could abuse me
But you would rather not
So uh you lose me
My interests, and on Wednesday
I call up all my friends they hate me too, they make me get wasted
And the next day
I don't care what all your texts say
Cause all I care about is acing tests and getting the best grades
In my class and I ? on thursdays to kick my ass
But I have to balance between studying and boys that I make passes at

Sounds like I'm a teaser, a walk about skank
But the reason is that I have nothing to write songs about anymore
I don't have cars, guns, or whores to talk about
And at this point I can't even think of any metaphors

I should just take a break from school or something
And that really fell apart towards the end
Just quit my job, let's quit my job
Eh I don't know
Stay in school, that's what I have to do
Cause I don't have an option
This is a song about nothing
It's Seinfeld
Musical Seinfeld
