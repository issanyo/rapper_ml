[Intro]
You like the way I move, so I’ll move a little quicker now
Come tell me what to do
You like the way I move, so I’ll move a little quicker now
Come tell me what to do and I’ll get you to stick around

[Hook]
Got a cab called up if you’re down for that
And if you’re fallin in love, then I’m down for that
You can follow me home if you’re down for that
'Cuz I’m down for that
And if you wanna get to know me we can keep it real
Take another shot and tell me how you feel
Just met you two minutes ago but..

[Post-Hook]
You like the way I move, you like the way I move
You like the way I move, hey
You like the way I move, you like the way I move
You like the way I move
You like the way I move, you like the way I move
Got a cab called up - fallin' in love

[Verse]
Every shot I bought tastes unbearable
I’m a little irresponsible, yeah, I know
I just wanna not be hysterical
There I go, there I go (there I go again)
Staring at the lights, while they glow fluorescent
Burning up my eyeballs
Wonder what the best thing is to say
What’ll happen if I say it?
I’m just gonna say it

[Hook]
Got a cab called up if you’re down for that
And if you’re fallin in love, then I’m down for that
And you can follow me home if you’re down for that
'Cuz I’m down for that
And if you wanna get to know me we can keep it real
Take another shot and tell me how you feel
Just met two minutes ago but I don’t wanna take this slow

[Post-Hook]
You like the way I move, you like the way I move
You like the way I move
You like the way I move, so I’ll move a little quicker now
Come tell me what to do and I’ll get you to stick around
I'll get you to stick around, I'll get you stick around
I'll get you to stick around, I'll get you stick around

[Outro]
(Sorry… You should start it over)
