I never met a pill I didn't know how to take
I never met an emotion I didn't know how to fake
I never met an issue that I couldn't debate
I never met another rapper that I wanted to date
I never got a tattoo that I didn't regret
Never been told a name that I didn't forget
I never been [?] that I could fit on my head
I never made a video you didn't embed

I need a new pair of shoes and my hair done
Where's Sonny Moore? Damn am I gonna meet a millionaires son?
I'm bored of being the rare one
I'm the chair woman never take a dare
I don't really care for em
Never met a bouncer that I couldn't convince
Never been at a social event and never fit in
I never had an ex I didn't kill on The Sims
I never lived in a city I didn't leave on whim

Never showed up to the party in appropriate clothes
I'm not allowed to use an oven or stove
I never made it in the city couldn't handle the snow
Never going to back to Brooklyn now cause everything closed
I write a lot of songs, all hits
Y'all sit down and take it in like cows at a salt lick
[?] You know I'm a loud chick, cold Kit
Want a lesson I could show you walrus' ball tricks

Pretend you never saw this
I'll be at the prom in Givenchy, Holly
I'll be at the pageant bringing all this, all glitz
I be winning sachets in the magic with the paw prints
Love carbs but I know to restrict em
And I don't own no bras cause I don't ever fit em
Avoid the college and fraternity cause all of em dicks
I forward all to my attorneys so it's always legit

I never bother with censors
I can't beat sonic adventure
But I'll beat all of you featherweights
Say you brawl like whatever
And my exotic [?]
I been iconic forever
I dig up all of the treasure
And I'm biotic; Iâ€™m Shepard
Tell me I'm not on your level
You need to halt and get clever
I know your mom think you special
I'll pull off all of your petals

I never bother with censors
I can't beat sonic adventure (x4)
I'll fuck your girl and your neighbor
Neighbor, with a B
God
