[Verse 1]
I don't have an opening, I guess I'll go ahead
I'm Bo Peep, no sheep, just white dresses
Red tresses and white laundry
I sing a song to my zombie army, I sing
"Who do you voodoo bitch? you can't harm me
Who do you voodoo bitch? you can't harm me"
You can't charm me, I'm a patrician
I'm singin' pounds in the trashcan, Kitty do the dishes
Singin' pounds in the trashcan, Kitty do the dishes
And I love NY 'cause there's so many bridges to jump off
The backyard's where you get dumped off
Lil' Kim wanna let the hive pump off
I just wanna drag you through the marigolds
And I just wanna preach you every parable
Wiz is black and yellow and I'm white and fuckin' terrible
I'm out in rocking chairs in front of Cracker Barrel
With a red nose like a character of carols at Christmas
I hear "miss Kitty, come here and sniff this"
I just wanna be like doom with it
I wanna kill a beat and resuscitate it in two minutes
No committee of clones to ride cock
And say, "LEAVE KITTY ALONE"
They're Chris Crock to me
You don't know why all the boys flock to me?
Bitch, draw your eyebrows on then talk to me
Draw your eyebrows on then talk to me
You don't know why all the boys flock to me?
You don't know why all the boys flock to me?
You don't know why I get blogged?

[Hook]
You're unable to discern if I'm the wunderkind or underdog
So fuck it all, I'm the wonderwall
I'm the one to call, I'm a slab of muscle under fat
And I'm in battle like a thundercat

[Verse 2]
I'm a thunder kitty, what a shitty little pun
But that's why I need a gun, a gat, or something like that
I get bottles thrown at shows a lot
And, I think my body needs an otter box
I'm hot a lot, I gotta get some otter pops
I'm Optimus, I boss around the Autobots
And I bounce in my own crowd
I need to get the fuck out of my hometown
And I bounce in my own crowd, bounce in my own crowd
Bounce bitch, bounce bounce
Bounce in my own crowd, bounce in my own crowd
Bounce bitch, bounce bounce
