[Verse 1]
Pale and frigid, never listen
I’m always rolling my eyes
Now I’m sitting, planning kisses
You hold me frozen in time
Don’t leave me blind, don’t leave me blind…

[Verse 2]
Tell me why you seem so small? Are you scared of me?
And tell me, do you breathe at all? Is the air unclean?
And I know I’m walking slow, 'cuz I’m bleeding in my sock
And the cars that fill the road, are they ever gonna stop?
Are they ever gonna stop? Are they ever gonna stop?

[Hook]
We’ll pick up all the pieces
And keep this all between me and you
We’ll put back all the pieces
And keep this all between me and you
Between me and you, between me and you

[Verse 3]
Hidden planet, pretty hands, you take mine
Melting me down
Whisper sweet, you’re wishing me a safe night
And sending me out

[Bridge]
I don’t wanna hear from anyone here so I didn’t pack my phone
Never really seen it rain before here, so I left my coat at home
If you wanna lead the way, you can take my hand and keep it
I can keep a secret
I don’t wanna hear from anyone here so I didn’t pack my phone
Never really seen it rain before here, so I left my coat at home
If you wanna lead the way, you can take my hand and keep it
I can keep a secret

[Hook]
We’ll pick up all the pieces
And keep this all between me and you
We’ll pick up all the pieces
And keep this all between me and you
Between me and you, between me and you
Between me and you, between me and you
