[Verse 1]
Well, you lost your head and can’t remember what to say
Lost the medicine to make it go away
Lost my shoes that I took off behind the stage
Lost in you, I want my memory erased
Hold my hands over my eyes and move it right along
Heading straight to you and I will keep my blinders on
Unbuckle, lay across the backseat
So baby, drive real fast please

[Chorus]
Speed by streetlights, tell me you adore me
Can you breathe right, and are you sure we
Speed by, yellow red and green light
Morning’s comin', and I’ll be runnin'
Running away

[Hook]
Running, running away
I'll be running, running away
Running, running away
Running, running away

[Verse 2]
Losing track of all the miles in an hour
Moving fast so we try to keep it down
I been listening to every little sound
When you whisper to me, I remember how

[Chorus]
Speed by streetlights, tell me you adore me
Can you breathe right, and are you sure we
Speed by yellow red and green lights
Morning’s comin', and I’ll be runnin'
Running away

[Hook]
Running, running away
I'll be running, running away
Running, running away
Running, running away
