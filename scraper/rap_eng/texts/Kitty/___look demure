They said to treat my body like a temple
But I'm a sinner and I can't relate
And I stay drunk off all this vodka redbull
See me shimmer like I'm candy paint

Hide you, poor baby, in your newport clouds
Buy you more later but I'm too poor now
So if you just wait a minute I can show you that I'm in it for you
I can show you all my shitty tattoos
(I'm used to it by now)

Don't you look at me with anime eyes, you ain't no anime
Get shook, I know you planned a surprise, hit up my family
Your rookie shit is so immature, and I would know
I donâ€™t look good, I'm good, I'm so insecure, so I say no
Don't you look at me with babydoll eyes, you ain't no babydoll
Get shook, you know you hate the surprise, 'cause boy I hate it all
I'm Sookie when I'm sucking your blood, I've got your heart
And now I took it and I'm fucking it up, pull it apart

Throw stones out of my glass house
You see me throw bones out, cuz why back down
Throw stones out of my glass house
You see me throw bones out, cuz why back down

(I'm used to it by now
I'm used to it by now
I'm used to it by now
I'm used to it by now
I'm used to it by now
I'm used to it by now)

Don't you look at me with puppy dog eyes, you ain't no puppy dog
I'm pushing my good luck all the time, and yelling 'fuck it all'
I took another risk on your love and I would do it all again
So I'll be looking you up until I'm dead

(I'm used to it by now
I'm used to it by now
And I missed out
I'm used to it by now)
