Underneath your ashes
A song played in reverse
I love to play with matches
I'm fond of feeling burned

I'm like a broken record, aren't I
How I'm tryin
I'm like a broken record, aren't I
Sound just like it
(cold and anxious)
I'm like a broken record, aren't I
How I'm tryin
(I know you are)
I'm like a broken record, aren't I
Sound just like it
You roll your ankles
I know you are
Falling over me

Weird how it's stuck in my head
Hear those same melodies in everything
I pore over something you said
While you're moving on to bigger, better things

I'm like a broken record, aren't I
How I'm tryin
I'm like a broken record, aren't I
Sound just like it
(cold and anxious)
I'm like a broken record, aren't I
How I'm tryin
(I know you are)
I'm like a broken record, aren't I
Sound just like it
You roll your ankles
I know you are
Falling over me
