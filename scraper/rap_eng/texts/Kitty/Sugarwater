[Verse 1]
Sugarwater hot pink like it’s Jamaica
On the mic I look just like it, I think
'Cuz I’m a fighter, I’m a mighty woman
Glow under light bars with lighters up
Inviting you to ride in my white car
I’m not allowed to drive it 'cuz my license is gone
But I can ride in it for radio
And like every song, and sing along at any volume
While I fight the urge to call you (call you)
So I’m gonna put my heels on
I can walk about a hundred feet
Until I stumble over flyers for your show on the street

[Hook]
'Cuz I’m a 10-speed on a chain of fake gold
Best sleep when I’m laying alone
I’m breathing fire, if you’re leaving, bye, goodbye

[Verse 2]
You say I’m salty, but I’m just tryna add a little seasoning
I know I make it awkward when I don’t explain my reasoning
I hear about it every time I poke at you to work
I’m your alarm and your nanny, wanna iron all your shirts
I’ll write it down, write it good enough to put it on my status
You’re crawling up the lattice with your vines
Running fingers up the trellis, you’re Elvis at the table doing lines
And I’m leaving 'cuz I’m jealous, 'cuz you’re mine
You’re sitting in the mirror, you splattered it with all of your spit
I’m rubbing powder on my chin, it’s on account of my zits
I’m in the bathtub splashing on my yarn while I knit
You’re dropping acid here while I babysit, you never listen

[Hook]
10-speed on a chain of fake gold
Best sleep when I’m laying alone
I’m breathing fire, if you’re leaving, bye, goodbye
So mean when you stay too long
So weak, but I play it so strong
I’m breathing fire, if you’re leaving, bye, goodbye

[Verse 3]
The name of the band is Talking Heads
But you always add a “the” to the beginning
It’s superfluous, and similar to me
I tell you everything and get you doing everything I tell you
Like an elephant, they get to pull the tent up at the circus
In a dead zone, wandering and never getting service
I can mend those socks now - maybe that's the purpose
I been searching for since I was seventeen
And all the ugly little hearts
I’m getting over
And you’re helping 'cuz you love me

[Verse 4]
Drinking Blue Moon bottles and I feel like Billie Holiday
And talking like Sinatra, saying anything I wanna say
I’m getting topless and I wonder what my mom would say
But I don’t give a fuck 'cuz I’m a grown-up and that’s what we do
That’s what we do, and that’s what we do
I’m in the bathroom, I just make you mad, huh?

[Hook]
10-speed on a chain of fake gold
Best sleep when I’m laying alone
I’m breathing fire, if you’re leaving, bye, goodbye
So mean when you stay too long
So weak, but I play it so strong
I’m breathing fire, if you’re leaving, bye, goodbye

[Verse 5]
Sugarwater dripping from you, it’s all I wanna eat
I’m like a hummingbird and unconcerned about it 'cuz it’s sweet
I’ll let you creep like a rose vine crawling up a trellis
And we know what it is and can’t afford to be jealous
I go to hell and back, I do it all for you 'cuz you deserve it
I don’t tell you that 'cuz you think I don’t try
I don’t tell you that 'cuz you think I don’t try

[Hook]
10-speed on a chain of fake gold
Best sleep when I’m laying alone
I’m breathing fire, if you’re leaving, bye, goodbye
