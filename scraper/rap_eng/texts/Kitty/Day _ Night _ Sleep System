[Verse 1: Haleek Maul]
My patience runnin' so bad
But then love is gettin' so bad that we crash
Yeah it was tragic, just blame a natural disaster
My loneliness was a factor
A sickness more like a cancer just eatin' away my character
See, I might need lastic flow
If I'm plastic you made sure this would happen
Bet, if I would tragic just stuck along for the ride with leaches eatin' my eye
Would cry if I could cry
But right now I'm just lying the cover
See from buyin' time til life desire
See, girl that was tryin don't cry
And then I die like I was onto my last life
No bibles, just silence

[Verse 2: Haleek Maul]
And I should be married to a sovereign bit
With the power to swallow me like laviathan
Never wanna cry again but here I am
Rains of icarus
Room's too hot, baby I'm sick again
I'm sick of this, I'm sick of knowing that you's a bitch
Yeah know for my shows this wouldn't work it
Who am I to keep playin?
From never seein' your heart again
Beautiful flow, ballin up with the less
Fuck all the stress, complaining just for the rest
Just face it, you just fazed as I am
I can take it in your face, you in a daze like I am
In the bed of roses, looks just like to lay down
Falls and I'm how I passed the sky
Flesh the louder, the louder, the louder, the

[Verse 3: Kitty]
The frog in my throat, it's holding down
The truth behind 99% of my jokin
Like the times I invite you over to choke it out
And every single time you decline and I try to joke about it
I got a fire that u can u can stoke an now
I'm Kanye after accidents;
Lying down, wired up with a broken mouth
I wanna lay u down and just poke around
U hear what I spoke aloud and still say "louder"
But I see your outer facade and it's brittle
You fiddle with me a little
I'm little but I can jiggle and juggle
But I admit it, you puzzle me like a riddle
And I might as well nibble on bits and kibbles cuz you're doggin me
And the frog in my throat is gonna croak:"I wanna get over u"
I want out of the fog that I've been cloaked in…
Cuz you're fuckin raw, and you're droppin jaws
And the streets watch, you're fuckin raw
As the streets and I see your outer shell and it's brittle
And you fiddle with me a little
I'm little but I can jiggle and juggle
But I admit it, you puzzle me like a riddle
I might as well nibble on the bits and kibbles
I'm a dog and I thought I wanted to be tied up and clawed at but I'm a fraud and really terrified of all that
So I take it slow do a great job
Tim and Eric
But I always was a terrible judge of character…
All you wanna do is tear it up
I know but can't u be noble like Captain America
I wanna stare at ya (I wanna stare at ya, I wanna stare at ya, I wanna…)
I wanna sit and stare atcha
I wanna sit and stare atcha!
Like the streets watch (and detox)
I wanna go home and see your green socks strewn around your bedroom read clocks- six am
I gotta jet soon
And leave locks of my hair around your restroom
I need to find peace, spas
And chill in steam rooms full of heat rocks and
I don't need u, I just need to detox!
I don't need u, I just need to detox breathes
