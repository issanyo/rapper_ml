[Verse 1]
Found more ashes on the carpet
I can tell your boys been over when I'm out
I'll pour water from the faucet
I can taste the poison, hold it in my mouth

[Chorus]
See you in the morning, I'll unlock the door
Baby if you need me, I'll be on the floor
I can play the corpse and you can trace
Chalk around my body, I'll be like a stain
I'll be like

[Verse 2]
So it's stars and ugly handprints
It used to feel romantic
I feel like a fool
Homesick, it's hard for you to stand it
Call me from the mansion
Well aren't you fucking cool?

[Chorus]
See you in the morning, I'll unlock the door
Baby if you need me, I'll be on the floor
I can play the corpse and you can trace
Chalk around my body, I'll be like a stain
I'll be like
See you in the morning, I'll unlock the door
Baby if you need me, I'll be on the floor
I can play the corpse and you can trace
Chalk around my body, I'll be like a stain
I'll be like
See you in the morning, I'll unlock the door
Baby if you need me, I'll be on the floor
I can play the corpse and you can trace
Chalk around my body, I'll be like a stain
