I never get bored of brainstorming reasons I adore you (2x)

I'm a sucker for lover's spats
And the back and forth
But our tussles are nothing
What am I packing for?
I'll never walk out unless I have to, boy
I'll never walk out the door

`Cause I get drunk and dramatic
And you get mad over nothing
And shout a whole lot of blabber
But does it matter? It doesn't

I'll never shatter this honey
Never running away
Cause when the calendar says I have to, I ache
Our close proximity
Always tripping over you and always banging into things

Your rhythm isn't totally in sync with me
But I want to be a measure of your symphony
And I get flustered
It isn't always so clear

When I must be
Away from you send a kiss and wait right here

Live your life when I'm gone
We can dance all night when I get home
Lalalalalala, lalalalala
Lalalalala, lala
(2x)

I make a lot of messes
But you're still the plus one on my guest list
Forever 21 like my dress is
Even when I get a little restless

Me and you is what the best is
All the far away is just a test
Kiss me
Through the phone leave me breathless
Kiss me through the phone and leave me breathless

It's just fine
Cause even when I'm seeing red I'll leave and then I'll be right back
Cause sometimes I need it for a reason my career and shit
It be like that

It's alright
All the feet and miles in between is only brief I know
Just one flight
And then you're at the end and I won't spend another night alone

Our close
Proximity
Always tripping over you and always banging into things

Your rhythm isn't totally in sync with me
But I want to be a measure of your symphony
And I get flustered
Cause it isn't always so clear

When I must be
Away from you send a kiss and wait right here

I never get bored of brainstorming reasons I adore you (2x)

Live your life when I'm gone
We can dance all night when I get home
Lalalalalala, lalalalala
Lalalalalalala
(2x)

Sorry for the glitter when I spill it on your pillowcase
And my little face is plain as vanilla tastes
Looking better with your killer gaze
And you're cool as MJ in his Thriller days

Sorry I'm sensitive it's
Part of what my method is
And I
Just want you to send a kiss to me
Just send a kiss

I nibble on your lip
I took the liberty of scribbling on bricks in Brooklyn
Every bathroom stall, and math book all the wrath
I'm crawling back from

You're good at what you do
You take the mundane shit
Make it all new
Unique New York
All weekend
All the creaking
Doors, the sneaking
You're my freak

Live your life when I'm gone
We can dance all night when I get home
Lalalalalala, lalalalala
Lalalalalalala
(2x)
