You're fools gold, you are cubic zirconium
You're hoein em, you are cubic zirconium
You are fool's gold
You fit a fool's mold, glowing like diamonds
But your molecules'll prove you're hoeing em
You're cubic zirconium you're fools gold
You fit a fools mold, you're a fool old man
You're cubic zirconium
You are fools gold
You fit a, you fit a fool's mold

I had you wrapped around my finger, but er
There's a little green ring there now, ew
How will I get your residue off?
You're about as fraudulent as a mirage out in the desert
Blue peacock, you're puffin out your feathers to
Bring a bunch of bitches backstage into your dressing room
So you can treat it like a petting zoo
And get heated that I never do, why am I friends with you?
You say you're silver, but you're filler with a filagree
Ask the bitches that you've been chillin with and they will agree
Smalls, you're not hitting the balls, you're killin me
Illegitimate like bill and I am hillary

You pillage all your image to appeal to the millions
Always asking "hey kitty, you think they're feeling me?"
You're a dentured grandpa tryna grill it
You're as authentic as a hand full of acrylics
You're synthetically made, you're like crab with a k
At the back of every china buffet
You're a pining away to be cool but you're a pint of the
Lame o'douls....fake...wanna be non-alcoholic whatever

You're fools gold, you are cubic zirconium
You're hoein em, you are cubic zirconium
You are fool's gold
You fit a fools mold, glowing like diamonds
Your molecules'll prove you're hoeing em
You're cubic zirconium you're fools gold
You're fools gold, you're cubic zirconium
You're hoeing em all
You're cubic zirconium, you're fools gold
You fit a, you fit a fool's mold
(oh my god)

This rhyme, it'll prickle like a pinecone
But won't stick, cuz you're fickle as a rhinestone
You differ like the timezones
Every trend you're on the dick of it, I'm really sick of it
You think you're hard as noreaga
So fake I'd find ya at a bodega
So babe, uh, you're a little flaker
But hey, at least you'll do whatever it takes, huh??

You're a Kardashian's ass
You're astro turf, cuz you're not actually grass
And you act so perfect but you know how roses smell and your hoax is
So bogus, am I the only one who noticed?
