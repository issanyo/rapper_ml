[Intro: Kitty]
I been picking up the pennies when I see 'em heads-up
And I don't regulate my spending, all I need is my luck

[Verse 1]
No money, me and my honey
Tryna get by on what we got to do
Oh honey, you can have money
And a top story on the evening news

[Pre-Chorus]
I love in when the wind goes blowing through the windows
We don't gotta pay a thing
Swimming in the cash flow, you with nothing on
Makes me wanna sing

[Chorus]
Skip all the know-how and fuck all the highbrow shit
Too pretty to die, we're doing fine
Trash talking love, trash talking love

[Verse 2]
Oh honey, look at that money
Don't believe nothing they been telling you
This season diamonds are in
Wearing millions and it's all for you

[Pre-Chorus]
I love in when the wind goes blowing through the windows
We don't gotta pay a thing
Swimming in the cash flow, you with nothing on
Makes me wanna sing

[Chorus]
Skip all the know-how and fuck all the highbrow shit
Too pretty to die, we're doing fine
Trash talking love, trash talking love

[Verse 3: Kitty]
Ah honey, isn't it funny
We don't need the money, I'ma let 'em outrun ya
I been picking up the pennies when I see 'em heads-up
And I don't regulate my spending, all I need is my luck

[Pre-Chorus 2: Kitty]
We're looking pretty in our Tiffany blue
And I don't ever have to listen if I'm sitting by you
We're never pretentious, only impressive
Fuck all your trends and fuck all your 'Benzes

[Chorus]
Skip all the know-how, fuck all the highbrow shit
I will be fine with you in my eye-line
Trash talking love, trash talking love
Skip all the know-how and fuck all the highbrow shit
Too pretty to die, we're doing fine
Trash talking love, trash talking love
Trash talking love, trash talking love
