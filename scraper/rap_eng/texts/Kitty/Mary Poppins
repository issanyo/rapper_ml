[Verse 1]
Rose gold, rose quartz
Stone cold, whole court
You see the black lights glowing?
Call me kitty kitty
We're in the back like -
Don't stop get it get it
I got seven pretty bitches in my Benz though
I seen all seven of 'em stick you in the friend zone (aww)
No no no, not to condescend, but I don't wanna pretend, no
If you're not gonna spend, then get out of my DMs, hoe

[Chorus]
Got a crowd when I'm out here shopping
And I like to let 'em stand and watch it
They're like, “that's a lot of stacks…”
And I keep pulling more out of the bag like I'm Mary Poppins

[Verse 2]
Feel like Mary Shelley making bad dreams real (it's alive!)
And you can call me Mary Chevy on my bad girl wheels (vroom vroom)
When I be blowing on that endo
GameCube, Nintendo
They're like, “Hello! Got a minute?
Could you listen to my demo?
Can I get a ‘hi’? (kitty, kitty, kitty)
Can I get a verse?
Can I hit that cannabis?
Can I ride in the back and hold your purse?
Can I give your hand a kiss?”
They see my pics and never let it go
Like, “scandalous!”
I read that shit and LMFAO
I'm in Miami, bitch

[Chorus]
Got a crowd when I'm out here shopping
And I like to let 'em stand and watch it
They're like, “that's a lot of stacks…”
And I keep pulling more out of the bag like I'm Mary Poppins

[Bridge]
I don't really know what I said
Got 'em bitter like a lemon rind
Ever since I showed 'em my bread
They decided it was peanut butter jelly time
I don't really know what I said
Got 'em bitter like a lemon rind
Every time I show 'em my bread
IT'S PEANUT BUTTER JELLY TIME!
IT'S PEANUT BUTTER JELLY TIME!
IT'S PEANUT BUTTER JELLY TIME!

[Chorus]
Got a crowd when I'm out here shopping
And I like to let 'em stand and watch it
They're like, “that's a lot of stacks…”
And I keep pulling more out of the bag like I'm Mary Poppins
