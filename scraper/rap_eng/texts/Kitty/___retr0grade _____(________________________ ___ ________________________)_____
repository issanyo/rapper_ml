Don’t trip but i been tired out, i sizzle like a star
I been extinguished and my fire’s out
I'm farther than the miners down
In caverns down inside and give us other shit to lie about
You crumble up evidence
And leave it on your way like a trail of hansel gretel crumbs
I hope you remember them
I guess you’re gonna find your wicked witch again to tear it up

Why you shakin? am i scarin ya?
Go back and read your journal
Come and tell me you were fair enough
My mistake, i didn’t care enough
I pack and let you burn alone
Yell after me, i’m terrible (x2)

I think i lived this once
I thought we already had done this once (done this)
I could give refunds
I could only give you one wish (one wish) (x2)

You make drama, fly all the way down the coast
I hoped you’d be there tonight
I can’t bear the tightrope walk
Bitch, i’m 56k of your terabyte
Down south, i am all the way all the way you can follow me follow me and you follow me follow
And you frown, pout
No more calling me, calling me, calling me, call her

I think i lived this once
I thought we already had done this once (done this)
I could give refunds
I could only give you one wish (one wish) (x2)

You’re so simple honey, ABC
But i’m ZYX so you baby me
You’re a ripple on the lake, i bleed
I will leak that next so you’ll ache like me (x2)
