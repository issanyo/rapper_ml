[Verse 1: Kitty]
I should be less creepy and less easy sounding
Please can you freeze me up zero degrees, freak me
Even though I'm greasier than pizza
More tweezers I need, Jesus, my teeth they just need bleaching
I'll be sweet to you, always free, I can leave with you
Birds and bees are a mystery, teach me?
With books thicker than Tolstoy, descriptive
And most boys would liquor me up, poison trickery
But I predict that youâ€™'e gonna see me and split
'Cause you're dirty Sprite, hi I'm Kitty, your gold teeth are the shit
And I'm Mary Jane and you're Petey, in the street, I'll invert you
So greet me with kisses, iconic and sweet
We aren't even acquainted but I'm gonna wait and listen
I really want you to want me, I really wanna take off with you
Really want you to want me, 'cause you're flexing in the trap
Every time I hear your voice I have relapse

[Hook: Kitty]
Ay shawty, let me holler at you
Ay shawty, let me holler at you
Ay shawty
Ay shawty, let me holler at you
Ay shawty, let me holler at you

[Verse 2: Lakutis]
First off, I don't love 'em, I bag 'em, I gut 'em
And, B, I don't know where I put 'em
Angie Teresa look like Jalisa from BET, she came to see you
I'm pleased to pieces but I ain't see you, no
Yeah, you see me at the party, I see you at the party
You said, you don't like to talk at the party
Like I'm a fireball at a party, c'mon
I can sit and smoke a ciga-cigar-gar from Cuba-Cuba-ba
This shit ain't a Mai Tai, it's Dirty Sprite, show you right
Sure you really really really really say you wanna be my lover?
Say you wanna go home and watch cartoons?
Yeah, me too, but not with you
Ride around town like a mobster do
High off weed and lots of booze
Meat in her tail like a lobster do
And she Dominican too, so I ain't fucking with you
Listen, mami, you really want me to want you?
Then don't want me, I got you
You really want me to want you?
Turn into a pack of bogeys
It's cool you thought you could know me but...
Nah

[Hook: Kitty]
Ay shawty, let me holler at you
Ay shawty, let me holler at you
Ay shawty
Ay shawty, let me holler at you
Ay shawty, let me holler at you
Ay

[Hook: Kitty and Lakutis]
Ay shawty, let me holler at you
Ay shawty, let me holler at you

Ay shawty, let me holler at you
Ay
