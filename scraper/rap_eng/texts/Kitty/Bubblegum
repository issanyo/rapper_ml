[Intro: Chippy Nonstop]
Felix Snow, baby
Yo, Kitty and Chippy on the track

[Chorus: Chippy Nonstop & Kitty]
Gimme some of that bubblegum, pop
Feel the bass drop with the drum, pop
Hands up like I got a gun, pop
We just came here to have some fun, pop
Gimme some of that bubblegum, pop
Feel the bass drop with the drum, pop
Hands up like I got a gun, pop
We just came here to have some fun, pop

[Verse 1: Chippy Nonstop]
I got that bubble-ubble-icious, come get this
Strawberries kisses on your wet lips
So sweet, you gonna miss this
Watch me on the stage, you're my number one fan
Lemme see your hands wave, wyl' out
'Cause you can't understand, grab my hand, let's dance
Come get it, come try, now's your chance
Come get it, come try, now's your chance, chance, chance, chance

[Verse 2: Kitty]
Twinkle twinkle I'm a star, yup
I get all the Star-Bucks
I run all your cards up
I'm Amelia Yards, huh?
I been makin' milkshakes
All the boys are in a circle tryna find out how the lips taste
Once we get in I'm never gon' let us leave
We just sneak in the door, we don't need a key
We just be the adorable [?]
[?] if they wanna be us

[Chorus: Chippy Nonstop & Kitty]
Gimme some of that bubblegum, pop
Feel the bass drop with the drum, pop
Hands up like I got a gun, pop
We just came here to have some fun, pop
Gimme some of that bubblegum, pop
Feel the bass drop with the drum, pop
Hands up like I got a gun, pop
We just came here to have some fun, pop

[Bridge: Chippy Nonstop & Kitty
Pop pop, watch it pop, watch it pop, watch it pop
Pop pop, watch it pop, watch it pop, watch it pop
Pop pop, watch it pop, watch it pop, watch it pop
Pop pop, shh, watch it- watch it-
Throw it up and watch it pop (Pop pop)
Throw it up and watch it pop (Let that bubble pop, let that bubble pop)
Throw it up and watch it pop (Let that bubble pop, let that bubble pop)
Throw it up and watch it pop

[Chorus: Chippy Nonstop & Kitty]
Gimme some of that bubblegum, pop
Feel the bass drop with the drum, pop
Hands up like I got a gun, pop
We just came here to have some fun, pop
Gimme some of that bubblegum, pop
Feel the bass drop with the drum, pop
Hands up like I got a gun, pop
We just came here to have some fun, pop
