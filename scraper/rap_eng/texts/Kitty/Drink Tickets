[Intro]
These diamonds, I know they're acrylic
But I'm still gonna shine 'em, make you wanna film it
I got guest listed 'cause I'm broke tonight
But I got drink tickets, tell me what you like

[Chorus]
These diamonds, I know they're acrylic
But I'm still gonna shine 'em, make you wanna film it
I got guest listed 'cause I'm broke tonight
But I got drink tickets, tell me what you like

[Verse 1]
I'm pretty like a figurine, a little loud
I know how to make them listen to me
I spill liquor on the floor, I'm drippin' Gin on your jeans
Just say "Kitty" at the door, and you'll get in for free, giggle me
Feel like it's a million degrees
I got your girl in the corner and she's grinnin' at me
Don't get bitter about it, don't get bitter with me
We can shimmy, shimmy, put a little pink in your cheeks

[Bridge]
I think you wanna get in between
You wanna grind on me
You know that I'm as kind as you see
I'm ice cold, Winter Green
I know it's Summer, but I'm Winter clean
White snow, you wanna get a dip
Think I'm gonna go cause I know I'm on your lip
Hello, my name is Kitty, do you wanna hear the hiss?
I know you like the bright red lipstick, come and get a kiss

[Pre-Chorus]
If we're bein' too loud
We can break this down and take it home
H-home, home, home, h-home
Take me home

[Chorus]
These diamonds, I know they're acrylic
But I'm still gonna shine 'em, make you wanna film it
I got guest listed 'cause I'm broke tonight
But I got drink tickets, tell me what you like

[Verse 2]
I keep my rings on me, 'cause all my fingers green
And in the VIP, got everything I need
I kinda like rhinestones, I'll never be ashamed
'Cause in the dark, our diamonds, they all shine the same

[Pre-Chorus]
If we're bein' too loud
We can break this down and take it home
H-home, home, home, h-home
Take me home

[Chorus]
These diamonds, I know they're acrylic
But I'm still gonna shine 'em, uhh
These diamonds, I know they're acrylic
But I'm still gonna shine 'em, make you wanna film it
I got guest listed 'cause I'm broke tonight
But I got drink tickets, tell me what you like
