[Verse 1]
I don’t ever think about you
Don’t buy anything you hear
And I can have a drink without you
And I won’t end up calling you in tears
I don’t have any pictures of you
Still saved in folders on my phone
And since I’m never thinking of you
I’m doing wonderful alone
I’m doing wonderful alone
I’m doing wonderful alone

[Verse 2]
I’ll tell you all about the weekend
And how I spend it all with other boys
You tell me it’d be nice to meet them
Without a bit of envy in your voice
And I won’t ever write you letters
So I don’t have a single thing to burn
And since I’m doing fine, I’m better
And I won’t have to sit and wait my turn

[Hook]
Affectionate and wise, you listen
Give me good advice I’ll follow
It’s definitely my decision
I’m not missing anything at all
It’s never “want” and only “can’t”
So while you hold my lonely hands, you’ll know
I hate the taste of soap and you’re a waste of hope

[Verse 3]
And I don’t ever hear your laughter
When I think about our little inside jokes
And I don’t ever see your cats’ fur on me
Or buy the kind of cigarettes you smoke
And I won’t ever sit impatient
And dream of, baby, when you’re gonna call
It’s only your imagination
'Cuz I don’t ever think of you at all
'Cuz I don’t ever think of you at all

[Hook]
Affectionate and wise, you listen
Give me good advice I’ll follow
It’s definitely my decision
I’m not missing anything at all
It’s never “want” and only “can’t”
So while you hold my lonely hands, you’ll know
I hate the taste of soap and you’re a waste of hope
It’s never “want” and only “can’t”
So while you hold my lonely hands, you’ll know
I hate the taste of soap and you’re a waste of hope
