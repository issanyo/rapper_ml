[Intro]
Is it too hot to dance?
No, we rock steady

[Hook]
I can be your Nancy
You can be my Sid
Baby I've been sittin' fancy
And I've been sittin' pretty
I don't really want your hands in my general vicinity
But if you wanna say we're dancing, I'll let you say we're dancing

[Verse 1]
The club is full of animals
It's like I'm walking through the zoo
I see you drooling boo
You're Scooby-Doo and the booties is moving on you
It's human food
You're rubbing every butt in the room
You think it's your duty to
I'm not even trying to be rude to you
I'll be courteous and word it all nicely when I say "Move it dude!"
Follow me into the crowd I got you scooting through
I get black and blue, little daddy wanna bruise it too

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
You wanna bump and grind? I can tell you're having trouble
The struggle is real, you wanna feel up on my stubble
You're gonna pop my bubble you muggle pretend to stumble any closer
I'll send you up in the air: wingardium leviosa
I wanna boast about it on the other hand
If you wanna look close to me do the hover hand
Tell your brothers whatever honey, I'll understand
You're just another "whatever", you're just another fan

Is it too hot to dance?
No, we rock steady
And I'm light on my feet cause I'm not top heavy

[Hook]

You know I can't dance, but you want me to
You know I can't dance
But I'll dance and you'll dance and we'll dance

[Hook]
