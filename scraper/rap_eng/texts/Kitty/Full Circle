[Chorus]
Gimme an S for stand up, getting excited
'Cause we're the best, now gimme a U for united
Gimme a P for perfection, E for exact
Okay now, gimme an R
And say DJ run it back
Gimme an S for stand up, getting excited
'Cause we're the best, now gimme a U for united
Gimme a P for perfection, E for exact
Okay now, gimme an R
And say DJ run it back

[Verse 1]
When I'm in Hollywood, I turn up in traffic
In Chicago, I get all the boys to lend me their jackets
Hated spending money so I moved outta Brooklyn
But I love it in Miami where the girls are good lookin'
When I'm in Nashville, I'm in line for the chicken
And if I'm out in San Francisco I do **** in the mission
In Atlanta, you can find me at a club with a pole
And down in Houston, I sing my song real slow…

[Chorus]
Gimme an S for stand up, getting excited
'Cause we're the best, now gimme a U for united
Gimme a P for perfection, E for exact
Okay now, gimme an R
And say DJ run it back

[Post-Chorus]
Gimme an S for SUPER
Oh yeah, we're super super fresh
We're super, oh yeah
We're super super fresh
We're super, oh yeah
We're super super fresh
Yeah we're super super

[Verse 2]
Ya’'l still asleep? Well, that sucks
I think you need to wake up (get up!)
You got some time to play today
I got that shit that make you say “whoa”
Look at me go
I pick it up high then I take it down low
When it feels like you're lagging out
Well come and bring it back around

[Bridge]
Full circle!
Yeah, we bring that beat around and back
Let's work em!
Yeah, let's get your feet to stomp like that
Full circle!
Yeah, we bring that beat around and back
Ya'll heard us
Yeah, nobody sweeter on the track

[Chorus]
Gimme an S for stand up, getting excited
'Cause we're the best, now gimme a U for united
Gimme a P for perfection, E for exact
Okay now, gimme an R
And say DJ run it back

[Post-Chorus]
Gimme an S for SUPER
Oh yeah, we're super super fresh
We're super, oh yeah
We're super super fresh
We're super, oh yeah
We're super super fresh
Yeah we're super super
