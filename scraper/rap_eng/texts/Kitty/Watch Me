Never met a pill i didn’t know how to take
But that was getting old i had to give it a break
Never met an emotion i didn’t know how to fake
But now i’m getting older so i’d rather be straight…

I never got a tattoo that i didn’t regret
But i ain’t gotta look at em, so fuck it i guess!
I’m not a brat!!!
Used to be a hot little mess
But i never made a video you didn’t embed (;

I got a new pair of shoes and my hair done
Where’s sonny moore??? damn
When I’m gonna meet a millionaire’s son??
I’m bored of being rare one
I’m the chairwoman
Never take a dare
I don’t really care for em

WATCH ME
I like the girls with the real short bangs
Black eyeliner, real gold chains
LOOK AT ME LOOK AT ME LOOK AT ME
I like the girls with their nails done long
Dance real hard to the emo songs
WATCH ME
I like the girls with the real short bangs
Black eyeliner, real gold chains
LOOK AT ME LOOK AT ME LOOK AT ME
I like the girls with their nails done long
Dance real hard to the emo songs

I got a past…..do we really need to bring it up?
It isn’t bad, but it is embarrassing enough
Keep on looking if you’re looking for unique
Cuz I’m an abercrombie lookin ass bitch and i don’t give a fuck (x2)

I got a new pair of shoes and a payment
Slay kitty ray damn
When i’m gonna meet a limitation
Wait honey have a little patience
Everything is fine now its a celebration
I got a new pair of shoes and a outfit, loud kitty ray
Damn, when i’m gonna meet a good accountant?? wow
And the sky is looking kinda cloudy (GET. OUT. OF
Maybe you and i can get a little rowdy MY. ROOM.)

I write a lot of songs, all hits
Y’all sit down and take it in like cows at a salt lick
Mall shit!
You know I’m a loud bitch called kit
Want a lesson? i can show you walruses ball tricks
I write a lot of songs, all hits
Y’all sit around and talk about it like a job at an office
Flawless!
I been on the phone on a conference
You’re at chuck e. cheese with your mom in the ball pit

If it’s ironic i get it
I wrote this song in a second
And there ain’t nothing i can’t do
Its all just whatever
And I’m biotic I’m shepard
I dig up all of the treasure
And you are all little heathers
I pull off all of your petals
And you are not on my level
I can’t beat sonic adventure
But ill beat all of you featherweights
Say you brolic i bet
I been iconic forever
I been iconic forever
You need to stop and get clever
You got the awfullest temper, you know
