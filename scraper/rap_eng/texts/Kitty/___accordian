[Intro]
I'm doing this alone
And it feels really lame
And I'm sober
Lame, lame, lame, lame

[Verse 1]
I don't like kissing in public, or holding boys' hands
But I wanna with you, you know how silly I am
A little freckly freak, but I'm freakily yours
So when the floor is all squeakily clean and my chores
Are all done
I'll tell momma that I'm off to the stores
And I'll be sneaky when I slither into peek at your drawers
And if that's a little creepy, then I'm sorry to do it
But I really wanna see it, so you'll get used to it
And if you just accept it, it's easier to take
I'm tryin' to get close to you
And then I'll make you mine
And before I was lyin'
It was you that I was writin' about the whole time
But now you're datin' her and this is bad for my health
Cause I don't want to be alone or with anyone else
So I'll kill her on the Sims and I'll get up out of bed
And I'll go to some show and I'll pretend I'm not dead
And I know your dumb habits will just drive her insane
Like how you'll probably think this song's about you
You're so vain
And you're always online, secretly tumbling
So how about you go out? I think you need somethin'
Like a tall iced coffee
Add the Stevia
To get the energy to tell your girl that you're leavin' her
Na, it won't happen, but just give me your word
That if it does you'll call me up so I'm the first to have heard
Yeah I blocked you over ?
But I guess this just tequila situation cause

[Hook]
I want you still
I want you still
I want you still
I hate you but
I want you still

[Verse 2]
So if you ever wanna just come by and chill
I know you'll call me when it starts gettin' rocky
And I'll be happy just to hang out
With Miyazaki movies and please, I don't mean to be cocky
But I know you think about me after too many sakes

[Outro]
Just, stop me
