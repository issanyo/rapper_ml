[Intro]
I wake up alone real early
And I’ll be coming home real late
I get a little lonely, sure
We all do sometimes when every damn day’s the same
(The same, the same)

[Chorus]
All these shooting stars I wish on
All I wanna find is someone who can tell me
Tell my future, baby
Tell me where the bells ring
All I see is stars and gardens
All I wanna find is someone who can tell me
Tell my future, baby…

[Hook: Chopped Vocals]
Tell me, I'm so lonely

[Chorus]
All these shooting stars I wish on
All I wanna find is someone who can tell me
Tell my future, baby
Tell me where the bells ring
All I see is stars and gardens
All I wanna find is someone who can tell me
All these shooting stars I wish on
On, on, on, on

[Hook: Chopped Vocals]
Tell me, I'm so lonely
