[Hook]
I need to put myself on a pedestal
I pull petals out, the only way to tell
That all my bitches, all my bitches love me not
All my bitches love me
All my bitches love me, all my bitches love me not
All my bitches love me, all my, all my, all my, all my
All my bitches love me, all my bitches love me not
All my bitches love me, all my, all my

[Verse 1]
Teen nightmare, Freddy Kreuger
Say your night prayers, hallelujah
So patient, underworked
Underwear like grannies under fluffy skirts
I think I'm Princess Peach, Sailor Moon
I'm into drinkin' bleach, nail my tomb
One nation, under God
Underpaid with the face like a fuckin' dog

I need to put myself on a pedestal
I pull petals out, the only way to tell
That all my bitches, all my bitches love me not
All my bitches love me
All my bitches love me, all my bitches love me not
All my bitches love me, all my, all my, all my, all my
All my bitches love me, all my bitches love me not
All my bitches love me, all my, all my

[Verse 2]
White Kitty but my heart black
You don't wanna start that
I been coolin' with a smoothie readin' Pitchfork
Ryan Schreiber, honey, good work
I love BNM but I never will be
BRK life indefinitely
And I never hit medical weed
In the bed, I ain't left in a week
Me and Chippy put the Zedd on, Clarity on repeat
Cheeks gettin' red on me
Tryin' not to put my crowd to sleep (Shabba)

All my bitches love me
All my bitches love me, all my bitches love me not
All my bitches love me, all my, all my, all my, all my
All my bitches love me, all my bitches love me not
All my bitches love me, all my, all my

[Bridge]
I see you with your terrier, I'll get you, my pretty
And your little dog too, I'll get the pair of ya
Sippin' on your Perry er, I mean Perrier
I can do it scarier, I do it the Carrie way
I see you with your terrier, I'll get you, my pretty
And your little dog too, I'll get the pair of ya
Sippin' on your Perry er, I mean Perrier
I can do it scarier, I do it the Carrie way
They're all gonna laugh at you
They're all gonna laugh at you
All gonna laugh at you
They're all gonna laugh at you
All gonna laugh at you
All gonna laugh at you
