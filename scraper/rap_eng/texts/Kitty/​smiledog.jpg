[Intro]
Hey, be careful with that, no, stop

[Verse 1]
The monster in my closet fought the one under my bed
And in the middle of the battle I said
"Don't tell my dad or he'll probably get mad
And he'll stop payin' for all the adderall"
I don't want that, I don't wanna get fat at all
In a room with the admiral, the bruiser brigade
It's been a really, really messed up week, month, day
I just rack up the hate, it comes as fast as a play count
And I'm just gonna chill on the playground
While you spend your whole day down in the depths of the net
Wanna bet? It upsets you
You want me to fade out and I am the rap game pest, get your raid out
And I got your ass obsessed, no shame

[Hook]
I'm not really interested in hittin' the tip top
And I got you mad but you're watchin'
You say, "this little white girl is ruinin' hip hop"
I say, "Damn right!" and take a lick of the Ring Pop and smile
No way near the tip top
And I got you mad, but you're watchin'
You say, "this white girl is ruinin' hip hop"
I say, "Damn right!" and take a lick of the Ring Pop and smile

[Verse 2]
I'm the kitten kaboodle and now I'm all over Google
And I am very Youtube-able
With the Beautiful Lou beats and hideous cuticles
You hide out in the cubicle and ponder whose daughter I am
A diabolical plot of the industry and
We didn't think anybody would be into me and umm
I don't give a crap, I get happy
Enough to have your favorite rapper twitterin' at me
And A&R sayin' I could be a star
And I'm way stressed, I just wanted a Betsey J dress
And some time off from Claire's so I could chill for a while
So I take a lick of the Ring Pop and smile

[Hook]
I'm not really interested in hittin' the tip top
And I got you mad but you're watchin'
You say, "this little white girl is ruinin' hip hop"
I say, "Damn right!" and take a lick of the Ring Pop and smile
No way near the tip top
And I got you mad, but you're watchin'
You say, "this little white girl's ruinin' hip hop"
I say, "Damn right!" and take a lick of the Ring Pop and smile
