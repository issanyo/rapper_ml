I had a dream in which I heard him say I wish I never met her
So I wrote a letter and it's probably better that I left it on
The floor of my Ford to get wetter and wetter and more torn
I'll ignore it forever and ever and I
Would rather you just send me back my sweater
And we'll just forget the whole thing
You'll get your old ring back
I'll get my old slingbacks out from last spring
And find someone new to replace our old fling
You were my little king, you know, of carrot flowers
Shit I flew for hours to watch you in the shower
But now you're too skinny and you do too many downers
And powders that I couldn't even name
But we knew growing up was gonna change the game
And I kinda thought you were gonna change my name
Because yours is a lot cooler. I'm a fool
For thinking you were anything but lame
I know you're somewhere doing your thing
And when the phone call it just ring and ring
And you ain't pick up but your phone accidentally called me back
And I heard the whole thing

(What is it you want, Mary? You want the moon? Just say the word and I'll throw a lasso around it
I'll take it!)
