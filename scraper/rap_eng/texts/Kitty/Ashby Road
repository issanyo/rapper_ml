[Verse 1]
I should have never started this shit and I think I'm gonna quit
Cause I don't rhyme when I spit and yes, I'll admit
That every crime I commit is just a lie talking shit
Is what I'm the best at cause everyone's buying it
And by it I mean us, [?]
Watch it, hard not to cuss in front of our moms
But fuck, the discussions online are shitty
And everyone in my city's like
"Hey, my little Kitty, can I get on a track?"

(umm, uh)

[Verse 2]
Okay, come over and rap into my Mac mic
And see if any of my seven fans like that
I don't think so, this shit is like art
With some quality missing like it's Elizabeth Smart
And they call me Liz Lee
They say I'm a hype beast
But I'm fresher, a snappy dresser, feathery as can be
A feather up in my hair and when you want to see me
Just stand up, rub the lamp like a little genie
If you're a little dreamy, I'll invite you inside
For a little of Kitty's biddles and some Xbox live
And a little bit of a wiggle
I'm little but I can jiggle
And juggle but not whistle
I'll boogie like Dale Gribble
Ill hug your bits and your kibbles
I'll play you just like the fiddle
Charlie Daniels it's a scandal
I'm a Roman candle

[Verse 3]
I'm the Chinese New Year, fire away
Like I'm blazing through Asians, a different one every day
And that's the only thing that keeps me coming back to L.A
And my flow's dangerous like The Strangers in blank masks
Cause I'll tie you up fast and stab your ass
Over and over and over, you'll have nothing to grab at
Smash, there goes your phone, you're alone like some old trash tat
Up in a black bag while I'm rolling in that cash
I'm moldy and old and [?]
I'm quick like The Flash
I'll catch em cause I'm Ash
Peek at you and your nice ass
I'm critical like mass
You get a hipster, tell my critics to eat glass
I don't need your damn sass
I wrote this way too fast

But everything I write is bullshit and I won't stop...
