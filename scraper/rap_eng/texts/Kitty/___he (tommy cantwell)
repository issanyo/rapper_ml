Didn't write this song just to get you to fuck
I just kind of wanna have you in the back of my truck
Cuz I'm still around starin' at you just bein' celibate
I keep doin' it forever man just for the hell of it
And I'm not trying to talk really loud
But being around you is like being surrounded in clouds
And you don't know how hard I try not to sound
Like I know your name already, I'm not really profound
I'm not really verbose and I'm just playin' around
But I see you at shows so am I gaining some ground yet?

(Swag swag swag (who's my daddy?) (laser guns) ( check your window) Swag)

Boy, I don't even know what you were thinkin'
When you said "Hey Kitty could you fill up my drink?"
So I went into the kitchen, spent some time at the sink
Now I'm handin' it to you, dammit Sam stop winkin
Just don't ask me what was in it, I see you gettin' sleepy
I tried to write a love song that wasn't this creepy
But I gotta be true to my art
And soon you'll be exactly like Elizabeth Smart
Now I'm in control of what it says on your charts
When the nurse is checking on your pulse and vitals and heart and shit
Oh your heart (aww) I wanna part of it
Now I wanna get into the very heart of this
You'll never hear this, it's disheartening
My eyes keep undressing and my knives keep sharpening
And every time I see you it's a lil bit startling
The butterflies or demons or whatever start garglin'

The blinds wide open so we can see you in the dark when you sleepin'
Your body fresh out of the shower
You touch yourself after hours
Chill out
You're sleepin' alone
Check your window, check your window, we're at your window

This might be a bad start to get off to
But i really didn't mean to acost you
I just really like your hair and how it's all slick and stuff
I spilled a lil of your blood I kind of want to lick it up
But I guess that wouldn't be vegan
So let's just drive around and listen to Sarah and Tegan
You don't even know me this is only a dream
And I'm just thinkin' of your eyes nothing to do with your semen

1,2 you're the boy that I want
3,4,5,6,7, shit
It's the bullet if you say no after all this
And I just couldn't take it you're so motherfuckin gorgeous
You're the boy that I want
3,4,5,6,7, shit
Solve equations baby you're my square root
And I feel a lil weird thinkin' that you're this cute
