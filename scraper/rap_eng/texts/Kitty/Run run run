I know that the devil's in town
You won't believe what I have seen
He moved into a house at the banks of
I know that the devil's in town
You won't believe what I have seen
He moved into a house at the banks of
Crosshill in the city of Berlin

Who's gonna help to get rid of him?
Who's gonna join this fight I'm in?
No help from police, priest or fireman...
I'm gonna call the BossHoss gang
To chase the mean eyed devil outta town
We're gonna hound the devil outta town
We'll send him back to hell, we're gonna bring him down
We're gonna hound the devil outta Berlin town

So run run devil, we're gonna give you hell
So run run devil, we're gonna kick your devil ass
Goodbye and sparks will fly!

I know that the devil's in town
To get the sinners of Berlin
And God knows, he's gonna settle down
Cause it's a hell we're living in

Who's gonna run? Who's gonna hide?
Who's gonna stand up? Who's gonna fight?
Who's gonna be a helping hand?
We're gonna call the Stallion Troopers then
And chase the mean eyed devil outta town
We're gonna hound the devil outta town
We'll send him back to hell, we're gonna bring him down
We're gonna hound the devil outta Berlin town...

So run run devil, we're gonna give you hell
So run run devil, we're gonna kick your devil ass
Goodbye and sparks will fly!
Run run devil, we're gonna give you hell
So run run devil, we're gonna kick your devil ass
Goodbye and sparks will fly!
