Rule number one is ya wanna have the upper hand
And your upper lip pout it
Then you get the fuck out, it's
Rule number two- get enough of you in his
Line of view but if it's too much you blew it
Slide through quick and
Early on you want the girly fun of twirling
Your curlys around your fingers
And bringin em in and spurnin em
So if they're burnin me you're doing it wrong
You can learn it, how to turn around and pull em along
Rule number three is don't assume that it was meant to be
Disregard your heart, and never ever wear it on your sleeve
Do exactly what you want and never aim to please
So be it if you need to take a sip to fake your self-esteem

How to be a heartbreaker, boys they like the look of danger
You got em fallin for a stranger, a player, singing "i la-la-love you"
How to be a hearbreaker, boys they like a little danger
You'll get em fallin for a stranger, a player, singing "i la-la-love you"
At least, I think I do!

At least I think I do, at least he's gonna think he do
A wink'll get him swooning
All pink-faced and looney for you
Harpoon him intact though
Okay, cupids exact bow
Don't be thirsty though just work it
Let it ring and text back slow
Rule number four is always leave him wanting more
Make him walk you to the door
Remember you are the award
Just look disinterested and instantly
You're sittin with him drinken
And he's thinking I didn't kiss her but I wish I did
But god forbid you forgot the lid
Of the jar you got him in
Tell him get with it cuz he's now fuckin with the kid
Get him smitten enough he won't wanna be rid of you
Don't say I love you though just keep it hid

How to be a heartbreaker, boys they like the look of danger
You got em fallin for a stranger, a player, singing "i la-la-love you"
How to be a hearbreaker, boys they like a little danger
You'll get em fallin for a stranger, a player, singing "i la-la-love you"
At least, I think I do!
