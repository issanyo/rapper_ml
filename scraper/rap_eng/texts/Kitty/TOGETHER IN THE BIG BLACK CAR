[Verse 1]
I don't wanna leave
I don't know how to stay this way
Like a single cloud
Stretched over a sunny day

[Verse 2]
Those beautiful hands
Gliding down my arm
In the big black car with
The wind whipping her hair around

[Chorus]
La la, la la, la la
La la, la la, la la
La la, la la, la la
La la

[Verse 3]
You said you wanted to go
But then you started to cry
I thought I knew what to say but
The words just leave my mind

[Verse 4]
You say, "If that's what it takes
I'll search the whole world twice
Like a single cloud
Blacking out a summer night"

[Chorus]
La la, la la, la la
La la, la la, la la
La la, la la, la la
La la
