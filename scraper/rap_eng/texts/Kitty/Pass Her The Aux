[Verse 1]
Wake up on a California day
And you know you're gonna make it
It's another morning in LA
It's no little vacation
I could never in a million years have figured out
What you were thinking, it's a shame
You play pretend, it's kinda silly when I think about it
(You wanna medal for it?)
You wanna medal for it?
You wanna medal for it?
You wanna medal for it?

[Verse 2]
In 2017, you were a little Post Malone
In 2010 you were a Merriweather Post Pavilion
I still remember 'cause you'd never leave me alone
I still remember thinking “God, I really wish I could kill him”
I know that I'm being harsh
But you shoulda made a plan
Man, that woulda been smart
It's a cruel, unforgivable world
And I hate to break it to ya but I'm taking your girl

[Bridge]
I know it can burn
But some boys got to learn
So listen

[Chorus]
I got your bitch in my sewing circle, I'm teaching her stuff
So when we rip you to pieces, then we can stitch you back up
I got your girl in the front seat, I pass her the aux
And let her DJ, she can play whatever she wants
I got your girl in pilates with me, I'm stretching her out
So she'll know how to flex on you when you let her down
I got your girl in my phone with her own little picture
So she can call me when she realize she don't wanna be wit ya
Don't wanna be wit ya
Don't wanna be wit ya
She can call me when she realize she don't wanna be wit ya
Don't wanna be wit ya
Don't wanna be wit ya
She can call me when she realize she don't wanna be wit ya
Don't wanna be wit ya
Don't wanna be wit ya
She can call me when she realize she don't wanna be wit ya
