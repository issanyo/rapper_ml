Baby Is the door closed? are you keeping focus, are you moses, are you why i’m inside
Of this swarm of locusts? and if so can you walk on the Red Seas
And see into the dark and make it light again (please please please)
Prince of Egypt, prince of Persia, Prince of Paris
You’re the prince of champagne and sunning on the terrace
You’re the prince of bubble bath, the crush i have is terrifying
Suffer, but i bear it. i know love will tear us apart again

Love love love love _______

You are nailing me to the wall, you shackle me like a slave
I’m failing, i feel you fall off the back of me like a wave
A factory made Impala roll fast on the interstate
I’m mad that you say you’ll call, but you bastard, you made me wait
Like a mastiff, you’re the hydrant
Raise my mast with your flag on it like a pirate
I’m a good girl with a Master's in wasting time, and i’m the pearl being cast among all the swine
The sky turned light blue while we were inside and i don’t mind

You say to spend the night, too late cuz the sky’s already light blue (x2)

Blah blah blah blah, you’re always fighting with me
Rah rah Ra, sun god, i need your vitamin D, i need your chemical x
So i can smile at whatever little mess i’m in next (x2)

Because i think the sky turned light blue while we were inside and i don’t mind
You say to spend the night, too late cuz the sky’s already light blue (x2)

Blah blah blah blah, you’re always fighting with me
Rah rah Ra, sun god, i need your vitamin D, i need your chemical x
So i can smile at whatever little mess i’m in next (x2)
