[Verse 1: The Ready Set]
No money, me and my honey
Tryna get by on what we gotta do
Oh honey, you can have money
And a top story on the evening news

I love in when the wind goes blowing through the windows
We don't gotta pay a thing
Swimming in the cash flow
You with nothing on
Makes me wanna sing

[Chorus]
La da da da da da
La da da da da
La da da da da da
La da da da da

Skip all the know-how
And fuck all the highbrow shit
To pretty to die
We're doing fine
Trash talkin' love

Oh oh
Oh oh
Oh oh
Trash talkin' love
Oh oh
Oh oh
Oh oh

[Verse 2: The Ready Set]
Oh honey, look at that money
Don't believe nothing they've been telling you
This season, diamonds are in
Wearing millions, and it's all for you

I love in when the wind goes blowing through the windows
We don't gotta pay a thing
Swimming in the cash flow
You with nothing on
Makes me wanna sing

[Chorus]
La da da da da da
La da da da da
La da da da da da
La da da da da

Skip all the know-how
And fuck all the highbrow shit
To pretty to die
We're doing fine
Trash talkin' love

Oh oh
Oh oh
Oh oh
Trash talkin' love
Oh oh
Oh oh
Oh oh

[Verse 3: Kitty]
Oh honey, isn't it funny
We don't need the money, I'ma let 'em outrun ya
I been picking up the pennies when I see em heads up
And I don't regulate my spending, all I need is my luck

We're looking pretty in our Tiffany blue
And I don't ever have to listen if I'm sitting by you
We're never pretentious, only impressive
Fuck all your trends and fuck all your Benzes

Skip all the know-how, fuck all the highbrow shit
I will be fine with you in my eye line
Trash talkin' love

La da da da da da
La da da da da
Trash talkin' love

Skip all the know-how
And fuck all the highbrow shit
To pretty to die
We're doin fine
Trash talkin' love

Oh oh
Oh oh
Oh oh
Trash talkin' love
Oh oh
Oh oh
Oh oh
