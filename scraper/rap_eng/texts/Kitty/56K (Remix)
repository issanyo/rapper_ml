[Verse 1: Big Baby Gandhi]
Sippin on the palmer
Lookin like a bomber
Spit it to your momma
Thinkin I'm Obama
Hotter than a sauna
Colder than a pillow
Rolling like a villain
Holla if you feel low
Still a wizard killing
Me I want a million
Bitches that's Brazilian
Money to the ceiling
Now I'm Young No Money
Spent all my show money
Spend it on a ho money
Drop it on a ho tell me
Yeah we can't have babies havin babies
Imagine me with a kid at 22 while I try to play me
Be even broker than I am now
Sucks like sham-wow
So safe sex is the plan now
And older me make better decisions
Stay home and watch television
My inner vision of better living
I've seen it, I better believe it
56 inch Zenith, like I got a 56 inch penis
56k!

[Verse 2: Nigel Nasty]
Catch me actin in the club something serious
Arizona labor day, women on their periods
Cool water curve cologne, I'm off my own patron
Anti-social so I'm looking at my phone for bone
Leave alone and I hop on the Ducati
Hotbox the helmet, feel it in my body
Grand central parkway, bought a baby parkay (Smooth!)
Jackie Rob rob your life with a shark splay
Information high stakes, optimistic primate
Beast mode, beast wars, CGI I'm high mane
Power up like nightsteel
Regroup like ReBoot
Regroup my people on chat room, be back soon
I just wanna dance like a baby
GIF me out ma, GIF me out, web's going crazy
22 male from Queens where your friends be
No photo on my profile, inbox looking empty

[Verse 3: Lansky]
Peace to my Queens team, party like the '86 Mets
Joint's slick, a bitches place is a mess (clean this shit up)
Designer drugs finest ones they all spent
Comin off mattins this white like the child of tibet
Listen baby I'm a New York Met
I used to play the park bench
Saw them pitchin out a head coach
And iced to ice to gold chains
Those were the days
Bring pops that was the thing graduated the lane
See bitches that was reminding me kids they baby fathers
And babies havin babies they're livin any kind of way
New York is douchebags, friendly on the chit chat
They be the type to boss up never give you sit back
Learned this back in 5th grade when nigga stole my Donkey Kong and
Had to retaliate, facing suspension I'm a good kid
Never took far from a crook man
Ironic how i thought about this all in central booking

[Verse 4: Antwon]
Before Google Chrome, and online scriptures
I had the AOL, used to jack off to pictures
Had a internet girlfriend, used to send me pictures
One was a mall goth and the other lived in Texas
Had a wicked one that swore she threw hexes
She gonna cut my dick off if another girl I'm sextin
'Twon in the Lexus
Drinking on the side of the shit, side of the whip
Bean pies fries and some dip
When I die 56K to my bad kid
But can a nigga live
I'm eatin scrimps chutney on the chips
I'm hater on my firewall
That's how real it gets
People think i'm blowing out
No ants to spit
But my friends broke too knowin how it is
Living day to day
Hope a nigga make it through
The ethernet bumping when the Comcast kills you
Nigga!

[Hook: Chippy Nonstop]
Ring a ting a ting, it's that dialup connection
Bad bitches on twitter that deserve a mention
Ring a ting a ting, it's that dialup connection
Bad bitches on twitter that deserve a mention
(It's that dialup connection, it's that dialup connection)

[Verse 5: Lakutis]
Running round my home town
Every day I spread my seed
Hundred blue eyed devils speakin spanish be my legacy
Me I'm born and raised New York but old earth Russian (Russian!)
Mixing up that heritage, Bitch more 'tussin (Tussin'!)
Smoke something so fucking ill I
Make a million every fucking minute can I
Get up in that gushy you can have my pack of gushers
Mami I still work whole bottles cocky
These old copper's will never find me
Damn I'm the man though (I'm the man!)
Style out the wazoo (That's a butt!)
Bitches say we love you
Fly out to watch you
I wish I could watch two
Mickey in the watch boo
Gotta rub me the right way genie in a bottle

Shoryuken shoryuken sh sh shoryuken shoryuken
Sh sh shoryuken shoryuken
Sh sh shoryuken shoryuken
Sh sh shoryuken shoryuken
(Lakutis Lakutis Lakutis lakutis)

[Verse 6: DVS]
DVS!
(Welcome!)
Call me the product of shoddy politics
Sloppy economy shittin bitch
And never call me again
I'm a commodity
I'll properly Macaulay my property
Home alone, paint can to the dome
Log off off my prodigy
That's how you say "get off my dick" in technology
It outghta be common knowledge but probably it college garbage
Word is bond that my modern day Sean Connery puff tropical marley
I'm unstoppable man (unstoppable man)
We them Duane Reade babies in the streets crazy
Eat loosies, drink Everclear, get zooted, and piss everywhere
Illuminati want my screenname and my body they gon' upload me to jail
Ghost in the shell
[?] get close to me
Hold a post like a rosary
Call the pope in to cope with me
Hopefully JoDeCi no
You could bring in all your gospel apostles
Impossible to knock me off line
(Goodbye!)

[Verse 7: Kitty Pride]
I'm all blue and orange, I think in portals
I'm Al Gore get on my global warming shit
I'll beat you more and more at it
Of course I got my cheats I'll make it gory again
I'll never get bored of it because I respawn
I'm a primadonna en linea, eating all of your dinners
I'm Michael Bolton beating all of your printers
I'm literati and wittier than you thought
You can follow my twitter at kitavel'
If I writ it then it's written well
Simply browsing my flickr begins to get it wet
And get erect, you're dim and I'm glimmering like I'm glitter text
I'm grim as if I'm Billy and Mandy
Stealing your fans, B
I'm willing and handy
I'll make sure you get Mr. Hands Instagram
I hope you get bit by a million ants
And get shipped to distant lands
Rap game tiny Danzig, I'm a little Misfit
Oops I did it again, because I'm Brit, bitch

[Verse 8: Ne$$ of Weekend Money]
Weekend Money!
Cybersex, Twitter beef
Chief Keef, Lil B
Credit card scam slinging grams on my twitter feed
Nigga gotta eat baby starvin round the way
EBT card balance low, baby mama cray
Money slow like 56K, you know dialup
Still 56 ways hustle-nomics by any means
While you was bracin for that Y2K
We mary jane and this white girl
Menage a tray all night till the daylight
Thugs dimes and trays
You know riding around getting it, no 2 Chainz
I ain't talking nothing fancy, Brooklyn bound 2 train
In the city with the skinny nigga end up slain dang
I'm just trying to spit these raps out
Waking up to the sound of a Mac poppin, no laptop
Diary of a trap rapper Ness
Signing off nigga, live from the apple

[Hook: Chippy Nonstop]
Ring a ting a ting, it's that dialup connection
Bad bitches on twitter that deserve a mention
Ring a ting a ting, it's that dialup connection
Bad bitches on twitter that deserve a mention
(It's that dialup connection, it's that dialup connection)
