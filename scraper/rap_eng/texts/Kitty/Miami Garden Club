[Verse 1]
I wonder what you keep here with me
I wonder what you keep in your teacup
You hear me when I talk in my sleep
I wonder if you can keep up

[Hook]
I'll let it burn and hope for your pardon
Perched on the curb I fucked up my car on
All the herbs I take; let them harden off
They can germinate in my garden
Take all of my pearls away
I'ma keep on faking every word I say
I can let it burn and wait
To rake the ashes of my garden up tomorrow

[Verse 2]
And I imagined I was bleeding out
That always happens when I'm sleeping now
Too heavy in my saddle, can't read anything too sad
'Cuz I dream everything I read about
You either hold it in, or speak it out
And I don't really wanna freak you out
I'll write myself a letter, hope I get better
I'll do anything to please the crowd

[Hook]
I'll let it burn and hope for your pardon
Perched on the curb I fucked up my car on
All the herbs I take; let them harden off
They can germinate in my garden
Take all of my pearls away
I'ma keep on faking every word I say
I can let it burn and wait
To rake the ashes of my garden up tomorrow
I'ma keep on faking every word I say
I can let it burn and wait
To rake the ashes of my garden up tomorrow
Tomorrow, tomorrow
