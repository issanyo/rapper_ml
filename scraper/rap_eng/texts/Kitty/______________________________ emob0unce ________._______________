The sun is gonna rise soon
Baby just swivel it like i do (x3)
I’m happy i’m off the ground, i’m sad to see you on land
The treasure map that i found had an x under where you’re standing
I fell off this mountain’s majesty into sand
In the morning but for now i’m just happy to hold your hand (x2)

You don’t wanna make me guilty, well you just did
I’ma look filthy when you’re busted
We’re out of line but tomorrow we’ll adjust it
Tonight you need to trust me, trust it
You should cut your tethers and sever all of your ties
We’re together and honey it’s rather nice, you should leave your sandbags down in the grass she’s past tense baby we should have one night

Cuz i’m kitty kitty, i’m wit it gimme, i get it get it, if you’re wit it i’m wit it i know you’re wit it and i’m wit it gimme, i want it get it, i’ll make you make you forget her i’ll make you make you forget her
Cuz i’m kitty kitty, i’m wit it gimme, i get it get it, if you’re wit it i’m wit it i know you’re wit it and i’m wit it gimme, i want it get it, i’ll make you make you forget her i’ll make you make you forget her

Look at the time, baby the sun is gonna rise soon
Baby just swivel it like i…
I’m happy i’m off the ground, i’m sad to see you on land
The treasure map that i found had an x under where you’re standing
I fell off this mountain’s majesty into sand
In the morning but for now i’m just happy to hold your hand (x2)
Glad i’m off the ground, but i’m sad to see that you’re landing
Map that i found had, an X under where you’re standing
Look at the time boy, the sun is gonna rise soon
Baby just swivel it like i do

What’s the issue, love i think you’re in denial
I make you giggle boy you know i make you smile (x2)
Cuz i’m kitty kitty, i’m wit it gimme, i get it get it, if you’re wit it i’m wit it i know you’re wit it and i’m wit it gimme, i want it get it, i’ll make you make you forget her i’ll make you make you forget her
Cuz i’m kitty kitty, i’m wit it gimme, i get it get it, if you’re wit it i’m wit it i know you’re wit it and i’m wit it gimme, i want it get it, i’ll make you make you forget her i’ll make you make you forget her
