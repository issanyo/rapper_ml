Let’s go on an adventure
Let’s conquer this beach, then the sea, then the world
Can you feel the earth stir?
As I stroll down the city and we run down the path
Backs to the sun, hair flying in the breeze
Your fingers ‘round my neck make my whole body freeze
Oh dear, I am so spent now
Not a diamond on my wrist, not a dime in my purse

Still got enough for a Monaco though
We’re right on time for the sunset evening show
On the beach cigarette between your teeth
I feel you hold me harder as you take another drag

This is the start of freedom
And the money, and the struggle, and the choices
Trouble is when you’re free, you’re exposed to the blows baby
At least I got my shield
It’s all kept away behind
Who cares about the real world?
I’m drifting home with the tide
I’m drifting home with the tide
I’m drifting home with the tide

Let’s cause a little trouble
We could play a game of kiss & run
It’s like I can see the future
‘Cause somehow I know you’ve already won

Boy, I know you’ll leave me
I know you’re just teasing
There’s no use in tryna please ya, keep ya
I’m just gonna do what I know how to do best
I’ll see ya on the shore, I’ll wear my Sunday best for you

I’ll have enough for a Monaco then
Right on time for the sunset on the seine
By the bridge, looking very Parisienne
I know you want me hardest so I’ll let you have me now

This is the start of freedom
And the money, and the struggle, and the choices
Trouble is when you’re free, you’re exposed to the blows baby
At least I got my shield
It’s all kept away behind
Who cares about the real world?
I’m drifting home with the tide
I’m drifting home with the tide
I’m drifting home with the tide

Moi je joue
Juste pour perdre
Moi je joue
Juste pour te plaire

I hear a sad sax song
It’s playing in the cites and the forests
The melody’s so wrong
You can see in the ripples of the torrent

This is the start of freedom
And the money, and the struggle, and the choices
Trouble is when you’re free, you’re exposed to the blows baby
At least I got my shield
It’s all kept away behind
Who cares about the real world?
I’m drifting home with the tide
I’m drifting home with the tide
I’m drifting home with the tide
