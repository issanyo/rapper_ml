[Intro]
GET OUT OF MY ROOOOOOOOM BLEH

[Verse 1]
Once upon a time, I spied on you
Bud Light Lime in my hand and I stand over there
And listen to your little lies about your cool life
You say she will be your wife, but I am
Whites red, irises brown, and your eyes wide
You apologize to me when I see you do a line, but like
I'm open-minded and it's fine
I don't do the shit, but I don't really mind it
I'm not heartless but I'm hardened, a rotten tooth
It's my party, couldn't cry if I wanted to
And the more you taunt me the more I think I'm wanting you
And ever since, you're the prince and I'm the one that's haunting you

[Pre-Hook]
Now you're tryna dip, without me
But I'm the princess, read my lip, it's pouty
And the sky is lookin' kinda cloudy
So maybe you should stay inside
And you and I can get a little rowdy

[Hook]
Lordy, shorty you're a 10 and I wait for your drunk dials at 3:30 am
I love them
Excuse me, you're a hell of a boy,
Your cigarette breath, well I thoroughly enjoy it
Lordy, shorty you're a 10 and I wait for your drunk dials at 3:30 am, I love them
So call me sober when you're ready, not goin' steady, but babe I planned our wedding already

[Verse 2]
I don't care how long it takes to get you after me I wrote our names on my binder
And everybody laughed at me
But it really doesn't matter, you are radder and cooler
A hooligan and my flattery makes me look like a fool again
You are a tool again, but you're the one that I've chosen
I'm not familiar with this type of devotion
I used to be a pimp without emotion but now you got me simpin'
And singing to Frank Ocean and thinkin' 'bout you
Ooh no no no, I been thinkin' 'bout you, ooh no no no
I been thinkin' 'bout you, do you think about me?

[Hook]
Lordy, shorty you're a 10 and I wait for your drunk dials at 3:30 am, I love them
So call me sober when you're ready, not goin' steady, but babe I planned our wedding already
Lordy, shorty you're a 10 and I wait for your drunk dials at 3:30 am, I love them
So call me sober when you're ready, not goin' steady, but babe I planned our wedding already

[Outro]
Just snorted a pill, feelin' good...
Just snorted a pill.......
