Hello I'm stress, Fuck you!
You're fired, and pregnant
Cause I control this twisted carnival, hit the exits
I spent your rent on killin' children, chasin' red cents
Tasted birthday cake, wanna vote?
And they been dead since
From hemp scented bar parking lots where justice don't chill
To money hungry starvin' artists dressin' up with no skills
So hush, pretend it's a game
Just remember the pain
Write a song about the industry's dust-intrigued lust
Then it's the same jargon-hardened garbage
How's your liver? How's your sister?
Drown her kids in liquor sips
Stereo sounds for six figures
It's bigger then right and wrong
It's writing songs for singing sheep to sleep
Bleach the sheets, Teathin' leeches teach the feast
On your baby's dreams, cause maybe things ain't that bad
Not considering, I'm not the victim, cop this image, cop this insulin
I'm not the victim, cop this image, cop this insulin
Rip the infants limb from limb
Stretch their skins for instruments
Bang the drum, bang the gun
Buy the jeans, buy the hope
Buy the smoke, buy the gallon
Buy the rope, by the throat
By the talon, buy the rope
By the throat, by the talon
Mimicking riddles for Lilliputians
Filling these shoes? that's impossible
Fossils rockin' Big Macs and public hip hop and toppled obstacles And stumbling
You've got a shot, humility's just an anchor
Work to turn the slaves into graves
Ashes to cash, dust to pay dirt
Chalk up a favor, pay it later
For now we'll fake the sound
Ground shakin' anti-gravity
When your wallet weighs you down
Hip hop culture's flourishing, worth worshiping these vulture skulls
Of target markets, red carpets, and carbon multiples
Of headings bleeding sevens, sixes and small print
I'll be Tyreseus to lead these lemmings to the dolphin shit
I'll be Tyreseus to lead these lemmings towards the dolphin shit
They have eyes but do not see
I'm not the victim, cop this image, cop this insulin
I'm not the victim, cop this image, cop this insulin
I'm not the victim, cop this image, cop this insulin
I'm not the victim, I'm not the victim, I'm not the victim
