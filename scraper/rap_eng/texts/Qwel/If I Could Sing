[Verse 1:]
I be your everything
Should those heavens fall
And should those feathers fail
Then I will catch us all
But i'ma lift us don't trip cause this is stress is all
But I've been trained for this strain and shit then I press it off
But it's just pain is all
And it's just gain is all
But we can take it contain it but if the brain should fall
Then you can call my name
I'll kiss you where it hurts
The angels hear your lips
So I bare the earth
We know they don't know love cause they swear it's worth
And only foolishness bruises are gone
She lays in lavender laugh in the songs
I'll be your sunny day
Although my souls a storm
And when that coffee's cold
And when that rose is worn
When that road is long
Then i'll brew chariots
And even if it breaks my back i'll still carry us

[Chorus:]
If I could sing
If I could sing
I would sing your song
And I would fight the world
I tell em' bring it on
How you like the world
When you breathe this song
Or make me try to sing
Although she be the song
If I could sing
I would sing your song
And I would fight the world
I tell em' bring it on
But how you like the world
Just when you breathe this song
Or make me try to sing
Although she be the song

[Verse 2:]
I bring Frankincense
I bring horses
And silk hangs from the whispers and breaks fortresses
That I built with force
I hear you pray for orphans
She the only queen
Why they checkerboardin'
Her breath is porcelain
Lashes ebony
While raining honey down
Splashes heavenly
But I would grab the sun
I give it modestly
Disconnect your face
Damn if I could sing
I will kiss your wings
While I watch you breathe
I bring goddess mead
Just to wash your feet
But it's a lot of throne
And not a lot of queens
This is not a home
If it's not with she
But when miss on the road
Without a jot of sleep
And ponder how we got
Just what it aught to be
Be your everything
Just like it's not a thing
And I would give you light
But damn if I could sing

[Chorus:]
If I could sing
I would sing your song
And I would fight the world
I tell em' bring it on
But how you like the world
Just when you breathe this song
You make me try to sing
Although you be the song
If I could sing
I will sing your song
And I will fight the world
I'd tell them bring it on
But how you like the world
Just when you breathe this song
Or make me try to sing
Although she be the song

If I could sing x8

If I could sing
I would sing your song
And I will fight the world
I tell them bring it on
But how you like the world
When you breathe this song
Make me try to sing
Although you be his song

If I could sing x8
