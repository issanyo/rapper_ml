[INTRO]

[VERSE 1]
Peep my attention getter, like "why am I miserable"
Because my persona's see though, nah it's invisible
And follow with a line, And more rhyme
"I find you listen throught"
Switch to [?] And shift the inner syllables

A little pause, it'll give it a swing
Don't forget, include the little "ing" proceeding the "swing"
And then go "Sing Sing" will help you get attention if you lose it
You can always start again, just mention "revolution"
Gotta say it like you mean it, like it's in the living proof

Put something shocking monotone and flip it cynical
Like understating baby raping, highlighting specific syllables
Act sincere and rapidly rap weird and cyclical
If that don't work, act misunderstood or flip political
Compare yourself to what you're not, like similes, but literal...
Gotta handle angry with your hand to hand demeanor
Insert pop-reference here "Something, something Brangelina"

[Hook]
And for the chorus try to keep it plain
Emotional images, dead ballerina, rain
Or just insinuate, and keep it safe, maintain
And just state the obvious "It's like I can't complain"
Or try to be ironic, like "I hate my hate"
You can even use them words you just learned today
"Validate my vediety," repeating's great
"validate my ve- something, rain"

[VERSE 2]
At this point repeat the chorus or get back to the verse
But if you start again use the pace you had in the first
It makes the hook more catchy, trust me, with some practice it works
Ease 'em in but cookie-cutters will snap, start rapping in spurts
And if you really feel the track, say something mad and absurd
"I pour a forty on my shorty, write my raps in a hearse"
And then reverse the established pattern, "Cheese is for lunch"
It doesn't have to make no sense you're setting leads to the punch
Buy some time like, "The C in MC is for crutch"
Lead 'em on to leave 'em stuck, and then you leave them with "what?"
And if you wanna lie you lie big, the fans will believe ya
Throw in an onamonapia like "BLAOW," and there's your lead up

A little mini bridge and get your voice descending
See, a cheesy melody affords the ending
Might wanna read your bumper sticker here depending
Or name a better man, or just a dead MC

It's like...

[Hook PT 2]
And for the chorus try to keep it plain
Emotional images, dead ballerina, rain
Or just insinuate, and keep it safe, maintain
And just state the obvious, dog, like, "I can't complain"
Or try to be ironic, like "I hate my hate"
You can even use words you just learned today
"Validate my vediety," repeating's great
"validate your vebiety something, rain"
Or resort to self defeating, "Why am I rhyming for?"
Make a crazy blanket statement, like "the sky's a whore"
Hyperbolize sometimes like, "I've died before"
Rhyme some more, or flip the pace, re-iterate, go back and rhyme the fourth...
