[Intro: *samples*]
"'No no, fuck listen.'
'I am.'
'Think about there's that one day every year, that fucking clicks by.'
'Like Christmas?'
'Yeah no exactly, like Christmas, except for you don't know it's Christmas. It's like, you know like, let's say you die on like August, fucking, 10th or something, right, but you don't know that, right?'
'That August 10th is the day you die?'
'Yeah but every fucking year from the day you're born, you know August 10th clicks by, but you never like put it together in like, a journal, but like, fuck man, every single year, goes by, the anniversary-'
'Of your death'
'I guess of your death goes by'"
"Darkness lingers in my mind"

[Verse 1: Bender]
Some hit a pothole at the crossroads turn around and walk home listen
Need to, capture the moment, give it Stockholm syndrome
When the cock crows, isn't hard to spot most spitting simply got no vision, only talk show wisdom
Now take it back a minute and it's all so vivid
Just a snot-nosed kid, with his jawbone twitching
A lost soul ripped and tryna plot those writtens till my compositions finished off most critics
Getting gonzo with it, in the spot showing symptoms
I can hang with any gang in the cosmos spinning
By a hot stove, knockoff Roscoe's chicken with the waffles, sitting in my mom's old kitchen
She watched Stone Phillips while she washed those dishes
Pops rolled product that the cops prohibited
This block's no picnic but it's not so twisted
I'ma plant this garden with some compost mixed in
Long stroll to Costco my poncho dripping
I followed some false hopes to foxholes, tripping
The pawnbroker shop sold my bongos listen
I said I just need a minute but the clock won't give it
It don't stop, ticking, it don't stop ticking
And if it's not broke y'all, don't fix it
It don't stop, ticking, it don't stop, ticking
And if it's not broke y'all, don't fix it

[Chorus: *samples*]
"Now my time has spoke, bring it all full circle"
"Represent from midnight to high noon"
*Black Star sample* "Hard knuckles on the second hands of working class watches"
"I try to stay on top my game then it's my time to lose"
"Now my time has spoke, bring it all full circle"
"Represent from midnight to high noon"
"I'm number one to second hands that work in glass watches"
"I try to stay on top my game then it's my time to lose"

[Verse 2: Patience]
Yeah, I was too busy for love, spent my days making cake
Paper-chasing the Queen's way day to day
Like fist over fist over fist on wheels waste away
Phones ringing off the table, she's on the edge, razor blades
No electro Gatorade, I'm more fam Jason Bateman
No distractions in my circle, you know I used to take the bait
Strap my boots, face the bush, put the puss on layaway
When I was thrashing in the sheets dames were Houdini, David Blaine
Now my sleep is fuel to function at this juncture in my life
Gotta paint, lay some tracks, stack paper before the night
Add a cutie in the equation and my days are looking tight
She knew me only as 'Patience,' here's the basics if you like
I'm unshaved she Bear Grylls so impressed, don't lay still
It's mundane, there's one night then I'll be back up out ya' life, the sun's ill
Fuck the morning, one day, gesundheit
No relationship to waste on this we'll go until it's light
Then I'm gone

[Chorus: *samples*]
"Now my time has spoke, bring it all full circle"
"Represent from midnight to high noon"
*Black Star sample* "Hard knuckles on the second hands of working class watches"
"I try to stay on top my game then it's my time to lose"
"Now my time has spoke, bring it all full circle"
"Represent from midnight to high noon"
"I'm number one to second hands that work in glass watches"
"I try to stay on top my game then it's my time to lose"

[Verse 3: Qwel]
Carpe diem as I bling up in the pawn shop
And all rock minutes find me chiseling a long shot
The chisel whittles bricks into form
As seconds tick on the minutes, and how the talk got ignored
And killers miss it it's vicious, to live each month for the bills
We know the story, gory slums 40s slumped in the hills
Shorty's gumping, his skill's to kill the present
Indebted to his future with greener grass
With itchy twitchy palms that see me streaming past
It's now or never breathing heaving heaps of glass
Thinking fast beneath the heaven peep me watching
Or pissing on a Rolex tocking
I was creeping fast to each his peaking flash, it's next week to catch my codex dropping
While they go-getting and Bowflex shopping
And living dos checks from homeless
But know the quota someone sold 'em, punch 'em and they clock 'em
And not gonna stop and think not for nought
Count the blinking off a thought that see the plot down the sink
It don't stop ticking and it don't stop tocking
Just rewind it on the spiral don't know why they try to box it
It don't stop tocking and it don't stop ticking
Watch the clocks on the year, on the month, on the minute

[Chorus: *samples*]
"Now my time has spoke, bring it all full circle"
"Represent from midnight to high noon"
*Black Star sample* "Hard knuckles on the second hands of working class watches"
"I try to stay on top my game then it's my time to lose"
"Now my time has spoke, bring it all full circle"
"Represent from midnight to high noon"
*Black Star sample* "Hard knuckles on the second hands of working class watches"
"I try to stay on top my game then it's my time to lose"
