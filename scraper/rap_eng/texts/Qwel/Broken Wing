[Verse 1]
Dah-nuh-na-na-nuh... yo
G4 for sure, we're goin' to war son
On his snide pride, lyin' with a smile and forked tongue
Stealin' with his eyes, chillin' back of the forefront
Will's design to ill the mind, but here the fourth horse comes
Screamin', "come freedom!" in this season of drought
Messianic demons meet in secret, we believe it aloud
Without the greedy grubbin' ducky hands, just feet in the clouds
Swingin' sickle at these anti-Christos keeping us down
Blingin' heathen at this bloody freaknik, geekin' to drown
Crowds of weekend warriors, but Meaty seeked, so we found
Never peace on this earth, reserved for sleep in the ground
Awaken only perfect in to keep the weakness without
But who's that creepin' in the teachin' without speakin' a sound?
The loudest deacon fell asleep and shrouds his speech with a doubt
Fallen singer, fingers you down to scheme and a shout
Blinded eyes screamin, "why?" tryna beef with the how

[Hook]
(On the ground) Wonder how with no wings, but we'll both fly
Only a fool would bring war on the Most High (is that your broken wing?)
Is that your broken wing? Misery lovin' company, huh?
Hopin' we both die

[Verse 2]
He who's living in vain, though it's given us bling
And paints life in image, gimmicks in this splintering frame
Tainted gift, that fallen angel clipped, crippled and lame
Limpin' for sympathy, bitch-like, but his riddle's his name
His fiddle dribbles out the brittlest twang, the vain cynical
Derail the faith train to inflame your fame, literal
Brang pain, vain to maintain the slaves' brains
And claims of brave ways, but can't stay safe and hidden though
Beef or vegan or white Jesus in the middle road
Posed for sold simpletons, frozen in a glimpse of hope
Focus dimmed and interscoped, floatin' winter's splintered boat
Notice hiss in intervals, lotus twigs and integrals
Known as bitch to flitty hoes, golden grip and fixing votes
Sold us six in Christmas ho's, broken scripts and videos
Jokin', just skinny bows, locin' shitty city folk
Hopin if the kiddies quote they'll see him as the pinnacle
Yah

[Hook]

Is that your eyes open high to the bloody horse soundin'?
Real birds and bees, honey, forty four thousand
Comin' on this cloud with a quake and a loud wind
Singin' with this Jesus to the drums of war poundin'
We found him, now's the season, ain't no reason for doubt, shit
If you ain't 'bout it 'bout it, you're about to get drowned, kid
'Til all praise Yah, triumph: Zion, this mountain
'Til all realize, to find my ties at this mountain
Bounce on witherin', slitherin', ain't no side 'round it
Or way to stay out, to catch the snake on his down rip
With triple-six brow, frow toutin' this foul chip
Blazin', amazed at how this truth just sounds sick
Fakes ain't forever like the weather just sound bit
The lightning strikes twice on his mic and resounded
We wonder in the thunder, ground without the dumb proud shit
To see you on His judgment with a blunt and a Crown Vic'
