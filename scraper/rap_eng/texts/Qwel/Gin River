[Verse 1]

Pearl shivers on the shores of Gin River
Just searching for daddy alone, he’s a swimmer, he’s just late for dinner
Her shadow dances on the surface and rips into ripples
And scribbles off to find her daddy like calamity’s normal
Find herself toe-testing these waters until both legs are piranhas
They hiss, “This one’s on the house” then slither on her
She questions, “Have you seen daddy?” he say “Yeah, maybe
But your glass is half-empty and that’s a pity pretty baby.”
He remind her of her father, watch the water get faster
She fall in Gin River, love whoever want to catch her
Undertow tug the string on her heart
The river freezing her breath
Fighting the current, screaming deep to her neck
Calling for daddy, they keep bringing her drinks
Oh how she sings as she weeps
Tossed by the river, it’s that lingering stink
So many fathers with strangers’ faces and promises crooked
She just been looking so long she just forgot she was looking

[Hook]

She say, I promise I done cried him a river
Plus I prayed him a boat
He’s not a swimmer though he swear he can swim
If you seem him would you tell him I miss him and that I never stopped looking
I’m not a swimmer but I been swimming for him

[Verse 2]

Gin River playing tricks on her eyes
It ain’t a place to get lost, woozy, stumbling, and blanking it off
Dragged by the river, reaching weak for the bank
So many selfish hands to help her stand on her feet with a yank
The smile drown before she did
Like hey doggie look at what, what we did
She looking for something but guess he had what she needed
She leaves a ghost just like that stick in the air
But daddy dream in her stare
Make up the high, the water, ring in her hair
It’s thick in these waters, it’s thick with piranhas and leeches
She say the deep’s a sink, you in it, try to swim for the beaches
Try to search for a day, days turn to weeks and weeks into seasons
And leeches turn into beacons, to each his weakness
She whimpers how the water is fine
The river cost her her mind
She jokes: "the clouds look like her father", brothers brought her some wine
Twisted ripples gives her up to the river
Toward the cliff getting quicker, nobody looking for sister
Pearl’s swimming where no one can find the pearl within the oyster
No one can break her down now, no one can disappoint her
Hide where no one can find her, the Pearl within the oyster
No one can break her down now, no one can disappoint her

[Hook]
