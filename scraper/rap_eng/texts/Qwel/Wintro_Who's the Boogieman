Man sometimes I feel the soul lift right out of my body
Who wants to scare me with a shotty, come get flamed like Mahatma
Screaming Mohammed at Ghandi, or rip you outta your name
The Freezer Burner make you proud of the pain, drown in the rain
The Freezer Burner sent me let me introduce myself
The speaking furnace verses earthquakes, typhoons I Qwelled
But dude I sell, Q, unconcerned with who I melt
It's through the turns, that these pussy's spooning like it's soup that I smell
The ice'll burn em like the crews that I felled, like they two by twelves
When I'm the truth stop trying to fool thyselves
It ain't surprising news for fools, it's just the boos that I yelled
Fucking with Chi is suicide, that ain't a bulls-eye hell
You peep my mic just like a glimpse of the after, skipping bricks from the rafters
While you're trying to fix your shits in the masters
Crimson incision rap deliverance rapture, mad sinister laugh
Ya little craft came in blistering fast
But still spinning when you get it, as if these nurses are rappers
With raps in their purses, trapeze at circuses, with behemoth, no net
Imhotep, the genius version, while you curse at your surgeon
That shit's for certain
Meaty creep up on that ass like FEMA, y'all bitches faker than Shiva
I bring the rain, and seen the flames through the freezers
While make believers keep the sheep leaping, I speak with discernment
You ain't the boogeyman coming out the closet, Freezer Burner
