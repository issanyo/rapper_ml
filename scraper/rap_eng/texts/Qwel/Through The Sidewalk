[VERSE 1]
Man told me he was lookin' for the truth
I told him cool I been lookin' for it to
From the high high's to the low low's so do the math through the path do the master don't know and low and behold
I find a teacher with the cheap talk tell me keep quite cause' people trying to sleep walk
And people trying to swag too
And all them bad ass kids acting through the classes they done napped through
Expounding so profound to find the sad truth
They stuck because the sad sad is stuck up in the bad loop
The moon zoomin` `round the planet it don't understand it
At least we're fun and runnin' orbits for the funless vantage
Without the substance but is lusters to the rusted root
Bananna split it if the camera click it must be truth
But we proceed to eat the meat spit the bones
Teach it if we speak peep deep to each his own
They keep it photogenic drippin' grease and teach your own
My peace will seek the truth while the beast will seek the throne
The fool will be the fool while the student's peep the zone then the people teach the teacher see the truth and keep it keepin' on

[Chorus]
Seek the truth free your mind
Reach a deeper root eat the fruit leave the rind x4

[VERSE  2]
When I was waiting` on the twelfth planet
We planted seeds in the granite
Said they would fight fed it with light
Of understanding
Proceed to manage from how we perceive it
Though we know it `ain't the perfect plan
We had a little left to give
So we receive
It funny how it works when mixing dirt and grime together
Spurt a perfect garden couldn't fertilize it better
The light I jerk it up from under the depths
The weed will crumble
But feed the newness when they tumble to death
(What's up)
Sometimes I'm looking through this life and don't observe it
A slope and through the dirt
And only focus on the burden
It's tough I know and plus I know
The rougher seas are certain
With flower in the down
Now we complete the purpose, perfect
We crush the bloom to get the perfume
A fight to touch the sky
Then return to Earth's moon
Yet we flourish through the suckers
With they eyes foolish wise talk
Workin` on the surface while it busted through the sidewalk

[Chorus]
Seek the truth free your mind
Reach a deeper root eat the fruit leave the rind x4
