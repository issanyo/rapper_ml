[Intro]

[Verse 1]
Woke up and smoked one
Think about we make jokes about everything fun
So cold that the [?] think [??] a little weed growing don't you dare [say fun?]
Professor asked the class the answer but they asked him about the cash advances
The fashion [matched?] the blackest cancer with the dunce caps hid around the clap for the back advance so where the wine at
Sign of the times is all
With the writing on the wall they could sign on the line
They could ball they could fall
Look mama no hands no feet where they [??]
One day they 'gon rewind that with a diamond hidden way deep in the mind where the secrets they find with a secret of shine too deep for the weak [?] his line at
So I wrote him a rhyme that reminded him that I would never get the time back
Find and refine it in the fine print in the contract when they listen to you slow they wanna have you rhyme fast

[Hook] x2
Money get a man to say cheese
[Ching, ching?] ya'll
Check out all them [faded?]
Wonder why they call them shady
Let the Autumn leaves fall [they made it?]
Ain't hard to ball green in the ring without the green ball and I look at all them jaded
When they all get together in the middle of the winter playing golf really all they say is

[Verse 2]
I don't know why miner's mine gold
I know why rhymers lie
Cause ever dime and diamond in they pile of shine still can't buy no time
And I don't know why whiners whine
Fo sho I know what the [?] climb
A peak, a glimpse
Paramount
Cause we're about [?] high
A mile or so above the banks
I try to fly
My brother's chained in 9 to 5s
And snotty [Illuminati?] rappers brag about powder blue Bugatti hobbies that's out of gas
Jimmy Gandalf
[??] green mini Lamborghini's is holograph
Still can't pass that polygraph
It's sad
[?] mad
Average savagery
Mad dash grab for green
It's padded apathy
These fat bastards sing bling for lack of steez
Try to grasp the breeze I breathe
To the mass I preach, "Don't drink that stagnant drink
Don't drink that stagnant drink"
Just wake up
Wake up

[Hook] x3

[Outro]
Money get a man to say cheese
[Ching, ching?] ya'll
Money get a man to say
Money get a man to say
Money get a man to say cheese
[Ching, ching?] ya'll
Money get a man to say wake up
Money get a man to say cheese
Money get a man to say wake up
Wake up and stay [steez?] ya'll
