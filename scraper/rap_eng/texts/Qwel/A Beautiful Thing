[Verse 1]
These city lights steadily strike him like a plague on his brain
His face strains to see whats right, fighting through the razor blade rays
The haze blinding his mind while he's taking this train
The grey gates and the rain falling upon the crates where they play
Just meditate for eight seconds but as he settles it sways
And makes its way through this ghetto in this incredible maze
We blaze the pace of great cellos, played the mellowest bass
And the tone of zonin off, lost in the gloss of the yellowish flame
Saints and felons sit, and kids flip the metal with paint
Amidst the tainted hellos and fellows with cells
Jaded, it's safest with his headphones left in its indelible shell
Sweltered storm starts to break, the grey melting away
Nods his head towards an elder, faded faces in panes
To pray a thanks out for this shelter, pain just fades from his face
Its amazing to his faith to embrace the grace of the day
Shave the weight, the forming hate and shorties hanging this crate
Replace the swarming lack therefore with the patience of saints
Await the waking morning glory, breaking rays in his wake
Making his way, the same train but he will make it today

[Refrain]
And he might, wake up okay, unscathed to smell the roses
Stretch and yawn for the dawn once with all that would oppose it
Behold it in its light in this life, in the hopes the focus soaks in
And a token for the saving grace (thanks) that the most gives

[Verse 2]
He witnessed stints where the showers flipped the hours to months
And binged for years upon the fringe of clearing clouds in his clutch
No silver lining in his grip without the power of a touch
Missed amidst the dirt and shit from which the flowers just sprung
Its funny how it does that at times, reminds him ours is to love
Our duty through these gritty city scapes and how were just stuck
Under the thunder, weather changes though some drown in the rush
Round and round she spins it out, power found in the sun
The changed frame, same train, clanging howling above
Then some shun the knowledge, when the rain came, some hours it floods
And rusts it down to dirt and powder but its powerful cause
Clouds clear to steer the light, life rises out of the mud
Round and round she spins, sits down and down he sinks
Thinks it out without an inch, without a glimpse
And hits him hard as ice and artificial life, melting out, sinking down around the brink
Of thinking about the change in man, and man about to change in me

[Refrain]
