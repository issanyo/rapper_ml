[Verse 1]
So something else is wrong with someone else, what else is new?
To tell the truth we knew it all along, I in the self in you
Hidden planks deepened inward, eyes out to snicker splinters
Find mouth to whisper, hiss to slither, rippled snide snout
Sliding down the winding ride of your faults when oft advising his salt
An awesome line of naught, provided you're wrong
When all that I did, hide it inside of me, lost within the pride in we
Finally blaming, named it "other", your blunder made a god of me
Judger of our brothers, another king amongst dumb oddities
Monopolies on properly being, agreed hypocrisy
Forgot to see his Father peaking, sinking out of, singing out of key
Sinking down the stream, but leading out to sea
Thinking bout the "we" without the "me"
Lost in the waterfall deep
Bring a song, with all to call it we can call it I'm clean
When all in all I'm chalked with flaws, lost in all that I bring
It all has fallen, I'm the heart of fault in all that I've been

[Break]
Well something else is wrong with someone else, what else is new?
To tell the truth we knew it all along, I in the self in you
I in the self in you

[Verse 2]
So many greedy beady self appointed pointed eyes
Sorta nice to see these seedy weaklings shrinking, deeply mortified
Finding sores, the easy sport applied to minds for disassembling
Lessons through that index finger, and hence it's never me
A weak defense, I guess, but it works in certain tendencies
Serpent gently squeezes your brain, all it needs is his name
And fangs to greet us, freed up fingers to aim
Who falls the shortest scored before the mourners, reap what you blame
I see what you done, I seen what you do
Imperfect man, a stupid animal, a handful, this mechanical zoo
The camera close zooms, who can answer? though the cancer soaks through
View opposeth, blew the roses open, stance just so true
Few are chosen, dude, I voted, notice the focus on you
When few are chosen, dude, I voted see the focus on you

[Break]
Well something else is wrong with someone else, what else is new?
To tell the truth we knew it all along, I in the self in you
Seen the pride in everything when you flawed
Lost in my pride for too long, stuck in my eye for too long

Well something else is wrong with someone else, what else is new?
To tell the truth we knew it all along, I in the self in you
Seen the pride all in all when you flawed
Logs in my eye for too long, stars in my pride for too long
