Just when I can't take no more
Staring in the face of when it rains it pours
The snake scraping straight through the stains
To sores like fade ain't weight

But tryin' to break my door
It's like the more I shake, the more I hate this floor
I hate this life with ice my main supports
Ignore inner advice to slice my veins for sport

Denying my pride just like I ain't the sort
When that's a lie I'm as weak as the pay reports
Thirty days on the road, ain't made a buck
And tryin' to save my voice
Hoist away at my ego, me my favorite choice

Just like we made our graves but probably blame our boys
As I turn this graying page, gaining fame to avoid
Today the same day again just like I anchored this void
Can't measure all the treasures that this pain done destroyed

I painted it, avoided naming it for blame it'd employed
Came and hit me like a gypsy, tipsy, claiming it's coin
Did me like windy city misery with grace of the ancients
Prayin' for Nathan but the will to see the will for the faithless

Gave it to me as a gift to do the will of the faithless
And gave it to me as a gift if you want it take it
I couldn't leave it, how those motherfuckin' cheeibum sang it
Bangin' in my soul, takin' it's control, total freedom

A man within this whole, not shown alone
But shone the kingdom and Jesus sacred throne
Over cherebum singin' and here I am a man
Just to stand and receive Him
And all I am is a man in the flash in this pan

We wallow in depression, stressed to face the odds
That's 'cause while we in this flesh, we away from God
Heads will hollow out your blessin's, lessons they been taught
Came from guessin' ass professions that them laymen bought

It's outta reason how them demons try to stray you off
Ain't got a thing that they believe in save the way
That they walk, it's bullshit like any men claiming
That they ain't wrong like it's all the same, it ain't
When we done sang new songs

I hold it closer than my name and my life
Than I cling to my wife and know it's higher
Than the rain at it's heights messiah's throne
Who shone it brighter than a ray of froze light

Kept me going on the longest of roads and
On the coldest of nights and then it showed me
This mic just like it told me to write and dog
You owe it your life like you control it

Just notice if it wasn't for his light no one would notice
The light that you opposin' is the life that you holdin'
Playin' with his might in handing frost bite to the frozen
See in his works within the earth or universe if your chosen
Teachers learnin' freezer burner lurkin' fumes to the focus
When we searched it seen it perfect just remember who spoke it

We wallow in depression, stressed to face the odds
That's 'cause while we in this flesh, we away from God
Heads will hollow out your blessin's, lessons they been taught
Came from guessin' ass professions that them laymen bought

It's outta reason how them demons try to stray you off
Ain't got a thing that they believe in, save the way that
They walk, it's bullshit like any men claiming
That they ain't wrong like it's all the same
It ain't when we done sang new songs
