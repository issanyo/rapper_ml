[Intro]
Don't be you
Don't do what you do
But what you say

[Verse 1]
Man I seen this sleek graff piece of Japanese baby shadows
Blasted black back against the foundation of half cracked knees
How could the artist catch the perfect and exact beauty of the little faces
From 10,000 stacked feet, cynical laugh
Musta had mad reach, flash freeze frame, made efforts
Remembered to paint the faded jump rope froze in half leap
Manâ€™s canvas masterpiece, banana ants and apathy
Hands danced to slash thick apple on this last patch of green
Fat squeeze the master painter heard the ground cry out black streaks
Deep ash piles of salmon pink and sweet corn yellow
Rusty red dragon stabbed across my sky so subtle
Greasy cobalt streaks from black squares, puddles of pear bubbles
Puncture holes double as burgundy moons over dim plum meadows
Mint stamped oasis and gray aphids of charcoal statistics
Scraping scarlet across mustard crust, maroon and hunter critics
Purple mistress circles of tin spin under burnt umber crimson
Instances of living under vivid lemon wings with quick orange flickers
Flash! Ripped the canvas in his mouth in his coarse grin full of slivers
To join the outer phoenix with the inner, seen it
Initialed with white warm splinters, scenic

[Verse 2]
He sang so carpenter
How you paint ivory fences with red hands and hammers
The left stumbles like the right dances, his full ring of keys answers
Be hardest tinkling C, sharpest stinging B. Carpal tunnel visions
Listen with heart and soul, then soul can pump beat literally
Heart can spot mind, mind can rock earth
The stuck prey alarms the spider in her dark cave soft purr
The faucets spring a leak on spoon and greasy saucer ring
The father sings this autumn breeze
Strangle this queen that knows the thoughts he thinks
Constant pacing back and forth crawling this long hall of keys
His song is out of reach now, down-stretched palms to maul the beast
He calls his sleep out, twisting sheets, spotted monstrous mistress
Starving queen darling clouded dream catcher chattering snarling teeth
Right back at him, call it holy matrimony. Fire ax in sharp C
Laughing foaming at the soul swollen charred reach
Arms locked arched back, scarred deep
Rippling water, tapping feet on beat, rhythm dwindling softer sleep

[Outro]
Be you
Do what you do
Always
Here come the locusts
Here comes the locust
