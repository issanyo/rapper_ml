[Verse 1: Qwel]
Since before I peeped the theory from the low end
Water deep three feet high and rising
Before I started smoking, I was smoked to my nose and eyes
When I stopped to realize where this ride went
Was it just the eyes of my youth like the coupe she keeps passing me by in
Went from straight up suicide to suicide, how we scrutinized it
Who remembers your walkman hoping there's still juice to rewind it
Knowing you knew the whole shit through and used to flip it through the silence
Faded tapes that faded away truth the desecrated grave she lies in
They never remenisce when she crosses over to the other side
It was a black sunday with a black moon on the horizon
Outcasted so the setting of the sun beefed with its rising
Ladies met brenda's baby a ray of hope to take some pride in
Clear blue skies, and ain't sure whose side it was who euthanized it
But ain't the devil happy as fuck?
Just saw her daddy get bucked
And laughed it up in the magazines that they never write in
Plugged her uncle with the same gat that she snapped at her daddy's light with

This craft saved my life and my soul
So many times that i've known
There wasn't any sign of light in this hole
For every rhyme that'd take flight from my soul just know
That there's at least 5 spitting behind it sitting from the writers of old

[Verse 2: Qwel]
She was such a good child, I don't get it
How she went from poor righteous teachings to hit the road to the riches

It's like a whole different misses(mrs.)
I ponder on the shorties around
And how they drowned in the driftings
As I'm sipping this crown bugging about the sound, and how what they missing
Is that shit without the glam and the glitz and it's glistening
Now it's the camera's pick explicit amatuers with canter to spit
When we was fans to the shit we had cause
Ain't a man that can tell me different
When shut 'em down just got you open
And KRS just made us listen
We had it made and paid in full now we the bullshit renditions
Of Rick the Rulers in dresses
Hip Hop hooray with these fishes
Just in the jewelers and dressers
Misused the message to get it
This shit was schooling or repping
Now it's forget it or dead it
When this new shit's like a fool with a weapon
Letting loose at his wedding
With kinetic proof in his love so now
How this love gonna get him
His pathetic excuse for a prophetic just to profess his concessions
She blessed my life with her strife
Without your honorable mention
How long can man dance on her flesh til his god reserructs it?
It's like

This craft saved my life and my soul
So many times that i've known
There wasn't any sign of light in this hole
For every rhyme that'd take flight from my soul just know
That there's at least 5 spitting behind it sitting from the writers of old

Man this craft saved my life and my soul
So many times that i've known
There wasn't any sign of light in this hole
For every rhyme that'd take flight in my soul just know
That there's at least 5 spitting behind it sitting from the writers of old
