Should I see’em? deep detail down to the glow in his eyes
Its hard to focus on what we’re talking about. He holding my mind
I mean its awkward talking weather, while he’s chewing the couch
Quite honestly im wondering just how you tune’n him out
All of the stress is less, is we get to irrelevant dealings
Can’t see eye to eye between us, there’s this elephant chill’n
And plus f’real he don’t forget, to the ceiling just feeling
That to ignore it, ain't so possible this obstacle’s grillin’
Its more work to block him out, I probably could if I focus
But then im foucus’n of giant pachyderms you don’t notice
I mean not to bring it out from the blue then out to the open
It’s just this mutha fuck’a just sitting, lokin just grillin my bogus
Plus the longer we ignore it seems the larger hes growin
We ought to go? really? he aught a go. I thought if we spoke it
If we put our heads together baby both of us we could coax it…
From out the door to down the road. But dawg f’real you don’t notice?

I sense a growing awkwardness, we talking shit, still its faceless
Fill’n spaces in between, I mean the time we been waistin’
But I can see it in your face you can adapt to its graces 
You blakin faces sayin’ “aw, we better off if we face it”

I say “ you don’t see that while elephant, relevant and quite clear?”
He say “what elephant?
I say “that motha fuck’a right there…the one big as a blue whales tongue drunked up buck and screamin’
The one no one seems to talk or notice standin right bewteen’m’
I say “ you don’t see that while elephant, relevant and quite clear?”
He say “what elephant?
I say “that motha fuck’a right there…the one big as a blue whales tongue drunked up buck and screamin’
The one no one seems to talk, or notice standin right bewteen’m’

We do our best to keep it plastic, chat politics and hide’m
Be cetain keep, it surface deep, when don’t want to find’m
And actually half the faces see it, called it and named it
Keep conversations hella shallow, shadows walls while hes pace’n
Basments ‘s rattle’n rafters shaken
Stampin and poundin’
Not quite sure that I can go on all this dance’n around it
But how am I supposed to concentrate hes shitting mounds we expounding 
If we don’t stop right quick and shovel it then soon we’ll be drown’n
He stuffs his feet up in our greetings snuffs and snorts his visions
Tucks his tusks in our nothing more than sports statistics
Line. Tryin’ to get right too it but ignoring the vision
An elephant just sitting blocks the door to the core divisions
No wonder we don’t want to get it, the same old emperor’s clothing
Im ick of dodging dropping shit from elephants you don’t notice
The beast just sitting silent screamin’ gleaming clear to intensions
The onldest conversation piece that nobody dare mentions

I sense a growing awkwardness, we talking shit, still its faceless
Fill’n spaces in between, I mean the time we been waistin’
But I can see it in your face you can adapt to its graces 
You blakin’ faces sayin’ “aw, we better off if we face it”
I say “ you don’t see that while elephant, relevant and quite clear?”
He say “what elephant?
I say “that motha fuck’a right there…the one big as a blue whales tongue drunked up buck and screamin’
The one no one seems to talk or notice standin’ right bewteen’m’
I say “ you don’t see that while elephant, relevant and quite clear?”
He say “what elephant?
I say “that motha fuck’a right there…the one big as a blue whales tongue drunked up buck and screamin’
The one no one seems to talk, or notice standin right bewteen’m’

Its liht the unwritten law they callin un-whispered songs and all the lockin in the closte gets’m thundering raw known by an unspoken name renound to unspoken fame
Never forgets and no one mentions him and know this is plain
