Lucifer called me this morning
Said: “Peedi Crack are you coming to work?”
I’m like a bullet out the Mac and I’m comin to merc
And there just ain't no turning back – when I run in your shirt

I used to abuse the juice and misuse the money
Until my cousin Brille ran up on me
And Brille had that ille not the Milli 9 on him
And said: “Peedi Crack. What’s the purpose you serve?”


That’s when I told him I’m a Roc la Familia
Watch my curricula
Not to particular on non affiliates

2004 the whores get sillier
My more money and the crib gets bigger

I stopped dragging my feet and did what I was familiar with
Popped – up in the summer and just smashed the shit
And that’s a fun, young man that insists to be the prince
That’s my home town he can sincerely represent, this
Lucifer called me this morning
Said: “Peedi Crack are you coming to work?”
I’m like a bullet out the Mac and I’m comin to merc
And there just ain't no turning back – when I run in your shirt

I used to abuse the juice and misuse the money
Until my cousin Brille ran up on me
And Brille had that ille not the Milli 9 on him
And said: “Peedi Crack. What’s the purpose you serve?”
