This is that telesoof fly, you can't get from a man
No gq, but this is swagger you gotta have
A fashion killer, go ask them niggas who pop them tags
I drop a bag money ain't funny so what I laugh
The cash is what I've been chasing since I've been dating
R Kelly on the molly, while poppin scrape on them datings
Got bitches in the back just in case we need penetration
We having fun, give me the buzz that go all my Nathan bitch
I'm just tryina make a name cause we not the same
How you niggas claimin you ballin when you out the game
Them shots burn, that vodka vray
Thought you was sick until the doctor came

What it do, nigga keep a bitch or 2
3 or 4, me on more, they some whores hit the crew
4 all dm htm, put it together, we the family drinking
And blow that kesha out that fanta leaf

Blow my lime to a lemon, my pa women
Take shots of cirock, coconut, pretending she give a fuck bout
What I be talking bout
But fuck it, hey this just the life
And I don't like it, I love it
Big booty stripper letting my nigga take turns in her
Apple bottom let a nigga put a worm in her
Had a problem with niggas until I got paid
And brought something for them brogs, hotshot raibe
In the building niggas chillin like a motherfucker
Cause I know it fin to kill one of you motherfuckers
A little whoa, all you hear from the mac, muffle crack juice
100 proof, get on my level
Not a nigga better no, never ever ball with avatars
Cedars off, take the jacket off, let the letters floss
Pwda, never a fraud, never lost, forever a boss
Whatever the cost, get out with my nigga

What it do, nigga keep a bitch or 2
3 or 4, me on more, they some whores hit the crew
4 all dm htm, put it together, we the family drinking
And blow that kesha out that fanta leaf
