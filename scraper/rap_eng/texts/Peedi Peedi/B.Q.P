[Verse 1]
Yo, live from PHI
We brung the loudest guns
Representing bad lands to the fullest
Rappin' bullets
Stack the hundreds the cash keep coming
Two track to track on that crack be dumbing
Getting goofy on the loose leaf
Two-seater with garcia call that the two piece
Kool G rap mode road to riches and
I bet when I get there it explode to smithereens
Rains great being make her dread scream
It’s a lap dance shit so hot you feel it in your dreams
Where’s my weed? I left it on the counter
Now it's gone got me drawn over stolen marijuana
Throw my arms in the air
Room like up like a flare
G-Code rules apply, shit don't fly around here
Cause we still we take it in your face
Brand new zozo make me break it out the case

[Verse 2]
I’m on the block where the money at
I just copped a key from a dummy stack
I’m running though the D's like a quarterback
I’m sniffing a half a yack and now It’s like I’m on set
This where the casket at the streets I mastered at
Everybody rap where the talent at
Church-goin' niggas where the balance at
Cause everything I talk is all facts

[Verse 3]
All the Linken parks empty when I conquer a nigga
God delivers a spin a rhythim make a strong shiver
From the land of the killers I’m iller
Expand selling coke on Instagram and in Houston
Gram in the center's staff battle my demons
And demonize the souls echos for four seasons
Still leave you bleedin' my nigga give me a reason
They are all authorities with mass murders agreements

[Sean Price]
The Brownsville bully, the bully from Brownsville
I take lunch money when fakin' the front, dummy
Hand fiends the work
Plus a thug never played tambourine in church
Thugs at my side and came to win
I put blood in your eyes like many men
Popular demand from the man I’m dropping ya
Understand my underhanded ways they poppin' ya
Shit, pot to piss in
I piss in the pot then I watch you sip shit
The hawk like an addiction
That's why he might walk like an Egyptian
My intent is evil
Evil intent dude got bent your people
Too tough nigga you do what
Rough cut your crew, your crew got a crew cut
P
