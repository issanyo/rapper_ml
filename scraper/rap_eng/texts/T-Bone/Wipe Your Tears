[T-Bone]
I know the world got you down
Bound by the problems and troubles of life
Full of strife pain and misery
Lookin for true peace love and happiness
That you can't find in a drugs
Sex or hennessey but come along wit me
If ya wanna hear bout the one that healed the sick
And made the blind see
The one that turned water into wine
And multiplied the loaves and the fishes
Healed the lady wit the issue of blood and cured leprosy
Cuz even when your friends ain't there
And you feelin like nobody cares
God's still there ready to cast all your burdens away
Let Him in your heart this very day and I pray
That every lyric I spit will penetrate the very depths of your soul
And I'm gonna let the whole world know
He can make your sins white as snow
Now let me bust en espanol, para mexicano, o cubano
Panameno, colombiano, argentino, chilleno
Nico, ya puerto ricano, lo que to te enseno
Es algo que me ensenaron de pequeno
Wit this instrumental I'm gonna make you get sentimental
Cause I be knowin that your feelin what I'm talkin bout
Make ya wanna shout shout, let it all out out
Like tears for fears, I'm tryin to reach my peers
And the thugs playas in the clubs and my patnas slangin drugs
Duckin em slugs lookin for love
In a messed up world thats cold like a freezer
Thats why until the day I die I'm gonna preach
The Word of God like the man of God they call Peter
Mira ahorita you might be goin through
A thing or two but know that Jesus still loves you
So its all good playa wipe your eyes
Cuz Jesus said that everything is gonna be alright
Now come on down

[Chorus]
Problems, troubles trials and storms will come your way
Jesus offers love and wants to wipe yours tears away
Cuz even when it seems like nobody really cares, Jesus is there
And he hears your prayers and he hears your prayers

[Bridge]
Don't cry the Lord replies
I wanna wipe the tears from your lonely eyes
Its gonna be alright
Tonight you might be goin throught some things
But joy comes in the mornin time
And I pray that through this rhyme
I'm touchin your mind
Body and soul let Him take control
And I know that if you trust in God
Leave your problems in his hands
Then everythings gonna be alright

[T-Bone]
Your cryin in the night cause you're lonely
Prayin to the Lord above please hold me
Somebody told me
That when I'm feelin broken hearted, sad and lost in the valley
You're the one to console me
Slowly ease the pain that I be feelin deep
Within free me from the life of sin cuz I'm tired of all the bangin
Drug slangin and playin wit the girls smokin weed and sippin on the gin
I need a real friend who won't leave me nor forsake me
Even if the whole world hates me who makes me
Feel like I'm somebody special for once in my life
When all my foes wanna lie and playa hate me
I seen so much drama throughout my life
So many of my peers died and I wonder why
I never got to say goodbye look to the sky
And pray that the Lord hear my cry
They say that You can set me free take away this pain
And misery and deliver me from the hands of the enemy
All because of the blood that You shed at calvary
You gave me the gift of eternal life and now I finally see
That You're the answer to all my needs so I'm down on my knees
Beggin Lord please forgive me
From this day forward I promise
To follow where ever you lead
Wipe my tears Lord

[Chorus]
