[Intro]
I got a thang for you, baby
I got a thang for you, baby

[Verse 1]
Dark and lovely, no one above thee
Ooh, girl you really got it goin' on
I wanna spank ya, I wanna thank ya
You're the reason why I sing this song
Are roses red, are violets blue
Who cares as long as I'm with you
So girl, let's just run away, oh
Where only the two of us can play, girl
Let's run away
You're sweet as honey and just as sunny
As a nice and warm afternoon
Your smiling face, your love and grace
Could light up any room
Now I won't flinch but I need a pinch
To make sure I'm not dreaming
Cause loving like this doesn't come ev'ry day
And I've got a couple of words that I'd like to say

[Hook]
So here is something that you should know
I'm in L-O-V-E
(Girl I'm so in love with you)
I got a thang for ya baby

[Verse 2]
Ms. Good Stuff, oh you're so tuff
You put some things on my mind
Now don't desert me but, Girl, just hurt me
With all the love you could find, oh, Baby Girl
My lemon drop, my lollipop
Girl, candy must be yo name
Cause yo sweetness is my weakness
And I'm damn sure nothing can beat this
Girl, I bet cha that since I met ya
The sun just shines everyday
No dreariness or loneliness
Has darkened my pathway
I never wonder cause my heart grows fonder
Baby when we're apart
Cupid must have hit the spot
Shooting an arrow straight to my heart

[Hook]
So here is something that you should know
I'm in L-O-V-E
(I got so much love for you baby)
I got a thang for ya baby

[Bridge]
Some folks are just old fashioned, well
And I know that other folks just want some action
(That's all they want)
Can you tell me who is looking for the passion in their heart
Cause you and I keep love alive
And Baby, you know we should never ever let it die

[Vamp]
Girl I got a thang for you
Sho'nuff got a thang for you

[Hook]
So here is something that you should know
I'm in L-O-V-E
I got a thang for ya baby

[Outro]
And there's nothing that they can do about it
I got a thang for you
