[Verse 1]
Kinda like tha mafia if you ask me, who's that?
All of them ridas from ORC, why's that?
'Cause we bad like 3 strikers when we spit rhymes
And preach to street bikers or convicts in rockers
There never ain't no telling what we gonna do
'Cause when you think we through, we come back and bless you
Doing another hit, ain't no stopping me and my gang
Boneybone Corleone from the MTV to cut fame
Same rapper and same rider, Westsider
Only difference is my beats and rhymes tighter, that's real
Now throw in the sky if you down with me
I represent that organized rhyme family
Family tree consist of demon killas, reaching drug dealers
And top billas making scrilla, living in white villas
Using guerrilla tactics to reach Crips and Bloods
And all the thugs that are looking for love

[Hook]
We's them rhyme sayers, tru 2 life playaz
Dippin' in navigators not trippin' on all you haters
Making rider music strictly for the Creator
With more game from the bay than the Oakland Raiders
We's them rhyme sayers, tru 2 life playaz
Dippin' in navigators not trippin' on all you haters
Making rider music strictly for the Creator
With more game from the bay than the Oakland Raiders

[Verse 2]
From tha land of Chuck Taylors, khaki wearers and gang bangers
Where rap singers low ride and rap about 'em colored bandannas
Ducking from one time, California sunshine
Projects and streets infested with thugs that are doing major crimes
Prime time couldn't paint a better picture
Best beware of them locs and O.G.'s before them thugs hit ya
'Cause where we from it's straight scandalous, Los Angeles
Ain't too many players or riders that can handle us
Slugs flying in every direction you look
Got homeless people living under bridges and drug addicts hooked
Ain't this a shame, that's why me and my gang preachin'
Like deacons to Bloods, Crips, Latinos, and Puerto Ricans
Every weekend we be speakin' and preachin', teachin'
How we need to be reachin' tha heathens, sleepin' while the devil's creepin'
Meetin' to put these suckers' names on contracts
And lift up and raise up the King of Kings like a car jack

[Hook]
We's them rhyme sayers, tru 2 life playaz
Dippin' in navigators not trippin' on all you haters
Making rider music strictly for the Creator
With more game from the bay than the Oakland Raiders
We's them rhyme sayers, tru 2 life playaz
Dippin' in navigators not trippin' on all you haters
Making rider music strictly for the Creator
With more game from the bay than the Oakland Raiders

[Verse 3]
We makin' moves like a U-Haul
Playa haters don't get it twisted like RuPaul
We don G's and family, that stick together like Siamese
Twins and Chinese steam rice from Chang Lee's
I'm the Bone Corleone with Lucky Luciano
Danny Brasco and Mr. Kevin Blanco
E-Doggie Montana from Nicaragua
And my little patna that we be calling Jimmy Hoffa
Can't forget about Chase Gigante 'cause when I rhyme say
He makes them beats bomb bay, hot like picante
This is the clique that I be talking about
And if you ain't down with us, then back up before you get clowned

[Hook]
We's them rhyme sayers, tru 2 life playaz
Dippin' in navigators not trippin' on all you haters
Making rider music strictly for the Creator
With more game from the bay than the Oakland Raiders
We's them rhyme sayers, tru 2 life playaz
Dippin' in navigators not trippin' on all you haters
Making rider music strictly for the Creator
With more game from the bay than the Oakland Raiders
