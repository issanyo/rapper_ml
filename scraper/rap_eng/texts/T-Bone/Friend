[Hook]
Friends, all my homeboys, how many of us have them
Friends, all my rouges, comrades, and patnas, ones we can depend on
Friends, all my homeboys, how many of us have them
Friends, all my rouges, comrades, and patnas, before we go any

[Verse 1]
Who can express what a playa feel
So much gratitude inside of me for my patnas that done kept it real
Loyal through tha hard times, when nobody didn't care
Everyone puttin' me down, but you was still there
So many come and go, turn from friend to foe
But trues is witcha when ya seasoned or broke wit no doe
Rolling a bucket, or dippin' in dropped double R's
Poor wit no record deal or signed and a superstar
Who can I call on when my backs up against that wall
That won't judge me, but love me and hug me when I trip and fall
Accept my flaws and mistakes, love me for who I am
Stand wit me waving at fans and when I ain't tha man
Picture me crying at the age of 9, so many homeys dying
Locked up in pens, living a life of crime, slugs flying
And been a witness to homicide
This life taught me love all you homeys while they still alive

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Keep ya homeys close, cuz in this business friends turn against you
Especially when you need'em tha most, that's when they'll plot against you
Then commence to rubbing your name in tha dirt
Leaving you torn apart wit all tha pain and tha hurt
Jealousy and greed twisted wit bitterness and envy
Make ya friend be ya most hated enemy
Seen it happen so many times before
Make ya wanna leave tha game and not wanna rhyme no more
Brotha against brotha and a father hating son
Somebody tell me what have we done
My back got blood stains and scabs from backstabs
Lived life looking for trues that I can call my comrades
Or soldiers, sick of them lying, backstabbing
Vultures in a world that's getting colder
Need a shoulder that I can cry on, rely on
Till tha day I'm gone, we share that homey love thug bond
It's a friend

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Some call'em dogs, others call'em rogues and comrades and patnas
Hogs and aces, whatever tha case is
Ain't no replacing a true 2 life friend
Soldier who been down through tha thick and tha thin
From the womb to tha tomb, come floods and typhoons
We stuck together, endured tha cuts and tha wounds
Scabbed and bruised,survived tha fights and tha feuds
Separated we nuttin', but together we can't lose
Homeboys to tha end, from tha hood to tha pen
My life in exchange for yours and your children
Nuttin' I wouldn't do for a friend like you
When I needed you tha most ya came through (that's true)
When you hurt I feel pain, when you sad I cry
Allies and down homeys to tha day we die
I got ya back like a chiropractor
From day one, throughout your life with tha final chapter
We best friends playa!
