Glory to the King of my life
Only You are holy

You are the life in me
You are the light that shines inside of me
All praise and glory to Your name
I will give to You my life
And anythin' that You require, oh Lord

I'm givin' all praises up to the lion of Judah
Alpha, Omega, plus the El Shaddai
Elohim, Yahweh, Messiah, Y'shua
What about the Adonai?

Somethin' about the name, Jesus
That makes me go insane, Jesus
Saved my soul from burnin' flames, Jesus
And He broke them devils' chains, Jesus

Glory, glory, how are You doin' to me, not bein' worthy?
You could have saved Your son, Jesus Christ
Instead You sent him for me
He gave His life for a sinner like me, threw my sins in the sea
He died, He died, He was dead but He rose in three

Glory to the King of my life
He is alive, He is alive
Glory to the King of my life
Only You are holy

Surrenderin' my will
Desirin' You to fill me with Your love
I live to serve my livin' King
Only I bow, please show my how
To love the world the way You love

Me givin' praises and honor, glory, thanks unto the King of kings
Whose precious blood is more than cars
Houses and diamond rings
Give Him praise and raise your hands
And magnify Him with the song and the dance and a

Give Him praise with the harp and the microphone
Tambourines, cymbals, drums and the xylophone

Gotta give Him praise, gotta give Him praise
For the things that He did when He walked onto Calvary
And died on the cross, when He took my place
He is alive, He is alive

Giving all honor and glory
Unto the King of kings and the Lord of lords

Glory to the King of my life
He is alive, He is alive
Glory to the King of my life
Only You are holy

Glory to the King of my life
He is alive, He is alive
Glory to the King of my life
Only You are holy

Giving all praise to the most high God
The Father, you know what I mean?
