[T-Bone]
Comin' straight from the West Coast killin' fields
It's the Bone Corelone, pimpin' keep it real
Y'all know the deal, corn braids and the thug appeal
Street slang, make the hits that the thugs feel
Demons nudge grill
When they hear my scoped aimed and I shoot to kill
And haters jealous, cause I'm stackin' hundred dollar bills
Platinum, crushed ice, and it's all real
Gospel hip hop got it locked still
Who you think it was sprinkled the game
With West Coast gospel rap plus a brim and a cane
Street slang and a message that they couldn't contain
Taught you about the streets and the way that they banged?
Cocaine, methamphetamine, gin and tonic, Rémy Martin
Hennessy, sherm, chocolate thai and chronic
Blood, Crips, esé, m treses
Pirus, Zou bous, no rules and Cali blues, y'all

[Hook]
Still preachin' that Word with them bangin' beats
Reach thugged out locs, grindin' on the streets
Hustlers servin' 'caine, Gs pullin' heat
Steady reachin' them with the Word seven days a week
[2x]

[T-Bone]
I'm still rippin' and kickin' flippin and spittin' lyrics that got you thinkin'
Trippin', grippin' your Bible, diggin' just to see what's written
Envision Paul in the prison livin' in the worst conditions
Makin' decisions with conviction for the One that's arisen
See my mission is to give visions to the ones that listen like catechism
But the ones arrested for vandalism, it's your decision
Eternal prison, or you can except what the Lord has given
[What's that?]
Your sins forgiven
See I'm tryin' to get you walkin' through the Pearly Gates
And save you from the lake of fire, full of demon snakes
[How do I do that?]
By askin' the Lord to forgive you of all of your sins
And then turnin' away from all of your wickedness and not turn back
Then start walkin' on the straight and narrow
Get the Word inside of your temple until it's dwellin' in your bone marrow
No more packin' a gat in the back of the 'lac
Attackin', and smackin', crack heads with a baseball bat

[Hook]

[T-Bone]
Still makin' G music for the cold killers
Gang bangers, convicts, pimps, playas, weed smokers and them drug dealers
Cap peelers, thieves, felons and them guerrillas
And drug lords overseas stackin' big skrilla
It's still the same, ain't nothin' changed
Street raps, altar calls and proclaim the Name
Never ashamed of the One that was slain
Endured all the pain, bleedin' with nails in His hand
Just to save me from the burnin' flames
Amazing Grace, He took my place
Paid the ransom, then got my sins erased
And now, words can't express what I feel inside of my flesh
Every breath is giving God glory until my death
See I'm blessed, beyond measures
Like silver and gold treasures and world pleasures
Spinnin Lexus' changin the world pressures
So that heathens that were grievin', theivin'
Can now believein' that Jesus bleedin' was for a reason
Because of what I'm speakin'

[Hook]
