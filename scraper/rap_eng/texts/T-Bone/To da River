[Intro: T-Bone & Lil Zane]
Ahh, for shiggity
Mr. Boney Bone Corleone, Lil Zane
And the one and only busta Javiggadink
(Lil Zane, ahh ahh)
Yo, holla at em Zane
Let em know how we do pimpin'

[Verse 1: Lil Zane]
Wasn't for him, I wouldn't be alive
Chastised for tellin' lies, since then baptized
Look in my eyes, can you see the pain?
Why does the sun shine when it rain?
Hard times got me feelin' daddy never did a thang
I'm God's chosen he put me in a Rolls and
Keeps my wrists frozen, never brown nosin'
Like an explosion, I cause a commotion
Spit the truth like a prophet, I talk to the ocean
People fear what they can't understand
I thank God that I can, I stay focused keepin' him in my plan
Never losin' my faith, haters gonna try to degrade
Gotta be in my state of mind or relate
Gotta know this is the end and ain't no time to waste
Time to face your fate and I pray you don't end up in a lake
Do whatever it takes, so many mistakes we made
But we gon' all get it right once we down by the riverside

[Hook: Montell Jordan & T-Bone]
Going down
(We going down to the river, take it to the river)
Going down, baby
(Yo, down to the river, take it to the river)
Going dow-ow-ow-own
I'm going down, baby
(We going down to the river)

[Verse 2: T-Bone]
I'm gonna lay down...
All of my Glocks and automatics
I'm charismatic like crack addicts
Ya wreak havoc like road ragers in bad traffic
It gets drastic but he's fantastic in attracting
No more packin', now we're fastin'
[?] passion
How can I get this life everlastin'
Sick of blastin' and dashin'
Flashin' like Charles Manson
He payed the ransom
Now I'm glory, holler, dancin'
I'm flippin' and rippin' and comin' with lyrical styles y'all never heard
Tryna reach them partners that be on them covers flippin' birds
Forget the English spit rhymes para mi gente
Buster and Javanni bringin' beats like Tito Puente
Salsa, merengue, ritmos calientes
Azuca sabroso para ti y para mi
Headin' down to the riverside so I can let the old man die
When I come out of the water a new man finna come alive
Revived with the Holy Ghost and tears in my eyes

[Hook: Montell Jordan & T-Bone]
Going down
(We going down to the river, take it to the river)
Going down, baby
(Yo, down to the river, take it to the river)
Going dow-ow-ow-own
I'm going down, baby
(We going down to the river)

[Bridge: T-Bone & Lil Zane]
We so hot
We don't stop
We take it to the river
You know we go down, down
'Cause
We so hot

[Verse 3: T-Bone & Lil Zane]
[T-Bone] I'm sick of packin' all these nines, slingin' dimes
And smokin' on the marijuana
Chillin' with pretty mommas from Havana in the Bahamas
Plus demons tryin' to see me hot like I'm in the sauna
And I'm just tryin' to get ya loose kinda like Madonna

[Zane] Everybody I know, tell em it's time to go
Me and T-Bone in the '64 sittin' real low
'Bout to roll to the riverside
Put that liquor to the side
Ain't no need for gettin' high; stay alive, payin' tithe

[T-Bone] Plus, El Shaddai, Eloyhim got me trippin' y'all
Never really laid down my burdens
'Cause I don't wanna be left and burnin'
Flirtin' with death and ain't promised my last breath
Dressed in prison blues, Holy Spirit got me under arrest

[Zane] I used to be a thug, sold drugs, might assault ya
Stepped up in the church, got converted at the altar
And I don't fault ya, fell back and he caught ya
Out tryin' to floss better live what he taught ya

[Hook: Montell Jordan & T-Bone]
Going down
(We going down to the river, take it to the river)
Going down, baby
(Yo, down to the river, take it to the river)
Going dow-ow-ow-own
I'm going down, baby
(We going down to the river)

[Bridge: T-Bone & Lil Zane]
We so hot
We don't stop
We take it to the river
You know we go down, down
'Cause
We so hot

[Outro]
We going down to the river, take it to the river
Yo, yo, down to the river, down to the river
