[Intro]

[Hook: T Bone]
Getting it in, My Zone
Walk into the bank like it's my home
Trapping like a bitch I got two phones
All this money in my pocket feel like Sean Combs
Sean Combs, Sean Combs
Counting all this dirty money feel like Sean Combs
Trapping like a bitch I got two phones
All this money in my pocket feel like Sean Combs

[Verse 1: T Bone]
I'm trying to flex, in the club we trying to flex
My niggas next, bitch nigga my niggas next
Cut that check, we can talk if you can cut that check
Show me respect, all I want is my damn respect
Bitch I'm balling, fuck is you saying
Getting money's number one
So we ain't tripping off you hating
Hit the mall, bitch we cashing out
Drink until we passing out
Wake up then do it again, now I'm in your bitch mouth
Go, man you niggas getting no paper
If your girl eye balling, best believe a nigga will take her
You can have her back I don't date her
I don't own a cape, I don't save her
And I guess we on top, cause all my old hoes is haters
Boy you fucking with my team, You get jumped like a hurdle
Plus it's not suspenders on but two straps, Steve Urkel
Promise Bone gone too feed his niggas
Cause my niggas riding with me
So they getting money with me
Do all numbers, expect fifty

[Verse 2: T Bone]
You niggas mad, niggas mad cause we in this bitch
No stopping now, counting money we getting rich
You can hang that up, niggas pissed ain't doing shit
Don't look at me, I can't help you with your bitch
Work, and now we getting paid
We was grinding but we couldn't make, But now we got it made
We hot nigga, no shade
We shining out, no cave
My old hoes trying to bug me, but bitch I got that raid
Quench her thirst, gatorade
And we don't need your help
We did this on our own nigga
Couldn't wait on no one else
These niggas looking for hand outs
You can get that somewhere else
So S.M.G. to the death of me, can't fuck with no one else
And we made it too the top
And ain't no way we coming down
All them hoes who did me wrong, hope them bitches see me now
Cause I'm balling on these niggas
And even more on these hoes
These broke niggas they hate us
Cause they ain't getting no paper
