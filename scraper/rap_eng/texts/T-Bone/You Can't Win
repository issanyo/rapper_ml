I'm so dope I'm impressing myself
Challenging rappers of my status dogg is bad for your health
It's like swallowing rat poison straight of the shelf
Or slitting your wrist then changing ya mind
But ain't no one around to help, dudes hear spit they like holy Toledo
Cuz when it comes to this rapping, I'm the one like Neo
I'm Jackie Chan, bet a hundred grand I could take out five of ya man's with one wave of my hand
Your whole caravan get smacked right in front of ya fans
I'll have screaming "No Mas" like Roberto Duran holla
They call me Boney Soprano, Young Luchiano, Bone Guevara
Raps Sammy the bull Gervano, I'm sick wit tha flow
Lyrical tactics and back flips, spitting ridiculous mathematics
Like it's gymnastics, when I die, be sure to place in my mic in my casket
And tell the world that I was fantastic, and that's it!

Chorus
Yall can't win, against us
If you try, we will bust
You should know, we're the truth
You can't do, what we do, oh

Opposing me could be detrimental like a skinhead wit a confederate flag
Walking through south central, it's suicidal like Kirk Cobain
Trapped in a thunder storm using God's name in vain, ouch!
Yall ain't really ready to riot wit me, I'm the Rocky of rap retiring rappers like Jay-Z
The Ronald Reagan of rapping yo that's me
I been rocking and running this rap game, Chinoâ€¦
