I remember growin up
And all the things we went through
I remember all the struggles and pains
When no one cared you were there
Gave me hope and you answered my prayers
I remember all the struggles and pains
Now its 1997
And it seems like times gone by so fast
As I think of the past tears run down my eyes and I start to laugh
I’m thinking about the things I did as a kid
With no worries just one big family
Chilling in Frisco living on Madrid
Moms was a hard worker and pops was a preacher man
And I give him props
Cuz he tried to raise me the best two parents can
Working nine to five to keep me in a private school
While I was disrespecting my teachers acting like a fool
I flunked the first and fifth grade
And I wonder how I flunked
The first time that they see my report card full of bad grades
Getting suspended everyday and letters from my teachers
The church keep pointing they fingers sending me to some other preacher
My teachers told me I was never goin to amount to nothin
Thinking as I get older I be robbing and pimping Thugging and hustling
Living that playa life but I proved everybody wrong
So to those who doubted me is to whom I dedicate this song
I remember growin up
And all the things we went through
I remember all the struggles and pains
When no one cared you were there
Gave me hope and you answered my prayers
I remember all the struggles and pains
Remember the days I used to see my sister hooked on drugs
Gang bangin tossin the forties
Nobody but the thugs
I used to cry to see my sister in that state of mind
But keep your head up Jackie god said it gonna be alright
Hopefully in 98 Steven gonna be back at home
Had old San Quentin
But if not you still got me, T-Bone
Half of our homies locked up in penitentiaries
And some in cemeteries all I got is memories
Of when we’d kick it at the schoolyard
With plain old Tims Locs and khakis
Tryin to show the world we was raw
Then in November 26 of 1985
My Nina passed away
But yo I know she still alive
Up there in heaven with the lord god bless us all
Seems as you’re older life can really start to take its toll
I miss my friends that didn’t make it to see yesterday
Pour out my heart and not liquor for those that passed away
I remember growin up
And all the things we went through
I remember all the struggles and pains
When no one cared you were there
Gave me hope and you answered my prayers
I remember all the struggles and pains
I still remember when we came home from San Jose
To find our home in ashes burned down to a charcoal grey
We lost everything we owned
And now we in a one bedroom apartment with no heater so we freezing cold
Trusted in god though
And knew that he was there for us
Whether it’s safe and sound or times are hard and dangerous
Like two years later when it happened all over again
My pops was running with a cash register in his hands
Tryin to survive the flames from the business that they had built
My mother cried and hugged me as she wrapped me in a quilt
I’m telling you it ain't easy
When god calls you and your family to be in the street ministry
I had hopes and dreams to one day have a rap career
Its 1997 I can't believe I’m finally here
Now I be buyin ??? And diamonds
And thank the lord
He blessed me with the gift of street rhymin
I remember growin up
And all the things we went through
I remember all the struggles and pains
When no one cared you were there
Gave me hope and you answered my prayers
I remember all the struggles and pains
I remember growin up
And all the things we went through
I remember all the struggles and pains
When no one cared you were there
Gave me hope and you answered my prayers
I remember all the struggles and pains
