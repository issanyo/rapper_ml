[Hook: repeat 2X]
Welcome to the Golden State
West Coast California where the one time hate
Bloods, Crips, es√©s quick to regulate
Lowride and hit switches till the bumper break

[Verse 1]
Uh, yeah
I'm leanin' back in my Chevy Impala hittin' the curb
Swooping up all the homies see my dogs so I swerve
To the left on 3 wheels
Y'all know the deal
Got the spokes with the chrome grill
With hydraulics
Hittin' switches on a day-to-day
From Compton, Carson, Inglewood, down to the Dirty Bay
Ridin' the Cali way
Dippin' initiating sparks on the interstate
Music blastin' and "California" written on the license plate
I love the Golden State
Sunny skies and the palm trees, beaches and lowriders
Singing songs like the Eastsiders
Sayin' "What? What? Uh? Yeah?"
Straight outta of the land of the unforgiven
Homies in prison wishing they ain't had three strikes
But this Cali thug way of livin' got 'em twenty-five to life
It's rags and bandanas, Chuck Taylors, Dickies and thug grammar
G's full of their evil ways like Santana

[Verse 2]
From Long Beach down to West Convina
Inglewood, Riverside, Palm Springs, Hollywood down to Pasadena
'Frisco, Oakland down to the Marina
Sac-town and San Jo back to Catalina
Ya gotta love it y'all, the sunny weather
No sweaters or leather
Just mink brims and a pimp feather
The land of superstars and nice cars with chrome tires
And bad traffic backed up for miles
[But we] still rollin' til the wheels fall off, gotta floss
In the Benz or Escalade
No need to playa' hate
This killa' Cali where gangstas rally and tally
The murders, in streets or alleys
From the Projects to the Valleys
Chuck Taylors, khaki suits, skip the wind breakers
This California, home of the three time champ Lakers

[Announcer]
Robert Horry passes it over to Shaq, Shaq out to Kobe, behind the three point line...
It's good!!!

[Verse 3]
I'm from the land of drive-bys and acmatics
Thug lords, Blood and Crip riders and drug addicts with bad habits
Charismatic with automatics and bandits holding these cannons
It's scandalous how they be dumpin' til' the last man standin'
That's why, gotta get to preachin' while they still alive
Cuz tomorrow not promised specially where them hollow points fly
It's do or die in the Golden State
Most riders regulate off of the smallest things
Like Red or Blue colors, then catch a case
It's California though, I love it like the riders do
Poppin' our collars, dippin' in Impalas, dog I'm stayin' true
Throw up the "W", this here's the anthem
For every ghetto, projects, neighborhood and street alley
Where guns be clappin'
Where they packin' a Mac or Magnum, braggin'
How they be jackin', attackin', smackin'
Takin' action just to get reaction
C-A-L-O-F-O-R-N-I-A
Welcome to Frisco, Sacramento and the streets of L.A
This is the killin' fields, y'all!
