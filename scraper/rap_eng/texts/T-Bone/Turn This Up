[Chorus]
Turn this up in your truck or your jeep wit the beat
If you know I got heat then, bump it bump it
Cadallacs jus dump it dump it
Everybody better turn this up
All my thugs wit the chucks in the da clubs
Wit tha ladies and the broads
Just bump it bump it
DJ's better dump it dump it

[T-Bone]
For all the homies in the hood that be fienin
For something they can believe in
Ain't not reason not to play it loud
Crank it partna, make my ghetto people scream and shout
Play it loud while I grab the mic and show everybody how we be doin
It when we chillin on on tha Westside, when we cruisin
We turn the volume up sky high
Bump the bass so you can feel the vibe
Now let me show you how we do it in the SCA
Where the bloods and the crips play wit AK's and ESES, from LA
Get tattoos of gangs and tha 13
Crank this jam in your E-Class wit tha 20 inch rims
And the wood grain dash white leather wit the DVD
TV's play it loud in ya SUV

[T-Bone]
Dump this bass in ya 20 inch pioneer speakers
For your rogues and your chicas, Boriquas and tha Nicas
The Indians, Cherokees and Incas
Turn this up in your hood or your barrio
The buro, or your car yo, Chevy Monte Carlo
Or your Lamborghini Diablo
Nod your head, roll the top down
Let the world know how us West Riders get down
From Inglewood to tha CPT
Oaktown, Frisco to tha NYC

[Chorus]

[T-Bone]
Turn this up in the middle of rush hour traffic
Or the projects where the thugs get drastic
Blast it, in the clubs where the broads be dancin
Turn this up in your Chevy Nova
Escalade, Porsch, or ya Range Rover
Navigator, Bently or Toyota
Or the Pinto on blocks wit the broke down motor
Turn this up put the windows down
Let the world hear this Boney Bone Coreone sound
When I'm flippin, kickin, throwin out the wicked
And spittin lyrical styles that got ya buggin out trippin

[Chorus]
