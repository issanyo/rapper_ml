[Intro: MC BST]
Damn son where'd ya find this?
Yo, back with a bang in 2017
T-Bone, Choc-Ice and the one and only MC BST
This is a send to Monkey Muz

[Verse 1: MC BST]
Monkey Muz, he loves to study
Stayed off before English 'cause he's got nobody(skrt,skrt)
He tried so hard to get some mates
Hangs about with Pro Clubs
Such a disgrace(git, git)
Blames Shad, Keir and Thomas for everything wrong
Granny hairstyle and he wears a thong
Jet's his bird and she's here to stay
Bestow for seconds get out of my way
Got a bit excited left a hickey
Bruise on her neck, that's oor mickey
Does she love tuna from a can?
If she does then Monkey's her man

[Verse 2: T-Bone]
Monkey Muz, stop being silly
Don't get mad at us 'cause your knickers are frilly
Your dad's name's Colin
He doesn't love you
Nobody cares, we're all above you

[Bridge: MC BST & Choc-Ice]
Wallet lined with all that cash
Your patter's so old, pretty damn gash
T-Bone won the fight so stop lying
You were then left on the floor like a baby crying

[Verse 3: MC BST & T-Bone]
Thought you beat up T-Bone
You were on top of the world
Next you're at the salon, getting your hair curled
Only four cans you need to drink
Before you yell to Alan Graham
"Alan I need the sink!"
