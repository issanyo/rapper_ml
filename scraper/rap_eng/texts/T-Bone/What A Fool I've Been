Lonely days gone by without you in my life
Even though I've tried so hard I do
Don't forget what you learned along the way
Talk to him and keep him close to you
I've lived dangerously
Not noticing at all what I quickly could become so soon
He is always there
He's always been around
You will see Him when you change your view

What a fool I've been
What a fool I've been
Just to think that I
Can live my life
Like time is on my side

I could not see through all the pain I caused
I was lost for my sin blinded me
We serve a great God
For when we turn away
He remains so faithfuly close to you

What a fool I've been
What a fool I've been
Just to think that I
Can live my life
Like I would never die

What a fool I've been
What a fool I've been
What a fool I've been
What a fool I've been
