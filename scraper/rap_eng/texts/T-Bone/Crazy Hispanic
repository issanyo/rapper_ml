[T-Bone]
Well its that crazy MC the one that nobody can control
So give me the microphone my name is T-Bone
I know you want to fight this, pull out your pen and write this
Cause you know I be the hypest, but I dont smoke blunts like Cypress
I never have, and I never will kinda like 7-Up, so shut up
Before you get cut up wit another lyrical piece of glass
Gettin thrown from the dome of T-Bone
To all them rappers sayin that my GOD is not real
But they dont be knowin my GOD is magnificant, Omnipatent
I'm obiedent cause if I disobey I'd be burnin in the fire
Cause the devil is a liar
Tryin to make me fall any way that he can
Like makin me think that I'm the man
By puttin a Glock in my hand or a beer can
Then I be hearin these voices sayin sip it
Put I buck the devil down, and grab the mic and start to flip it
Flop it, then I be pullin my Bible out of my pocket
And remind the devil that he's been defeated, nobody cheat
Jesus Christ won fair and square when He died apon the Cross
Which mean the blood was not lost
So devil get the heck away from me cause I'm that crazy hispanic
When I grab the mic I start to panic
Committin perfect crimes, wit the perfect rhymes
Mutalatin demons, hold up I think I somebody screamin
Oh I think I recognize that yell
That the sound of twenty thousand demons burnin in hell
And if you dont want to be there, then you best change your ways
I eat demons like a pack of Frito Lays, anyways
I got my dues, so gloria Jesus
Go out and tell the devil theres a crazy latin on the loose

[Chorus]
Cause no one can handle and wonder and loco
A crazy hispanic
[2x]

[T-Bone]
I be that latin MC, that the devil can't see
Like the wind that hear goin in ear
Like a cutip or even Casper the ghost
I burn MCs like toast
The oven's hot roast dont mean to boast
But since the age of 8 I have been unfadeable
Suckas get big heads, but head is not inflatable
So if you like hip hop while I beat I got em
From the top to the bottom, Bob Cat brought em
From the top of his dome to the studio
Wit this crazy flow to the radio, gotta save a soul
Is what I'm screamin, I got a demon on my infered
So I pop the demon like a fat pimple on my head
Nuff said, demons on the ground all around
Maybe next time they'll think before messin wit the brown
Crazy hispanic, skitzophranic type of fellow
I eat MCs like jello, hello
Lay your head apon the pillow, cause your raps need a nap
Oh snaps, crackle pop, this some real hip hop
Not some drip drop, water down type of junk punk
But the type of stuff that makes demons weary
They fear me, like a mouse does a cat
Cause I'ma maniac
Nuts, out of control
The devil tryin to steal my soul
But he won't suceed, I'll make him plead and bleed
Mercy, mercy to this crazy hispanic
And then I'll do it all over again

[Chorus]

[T-Bone]
Well its that lunatic latin comin straight from the mission
District I get ballistic let me kick this
Rhyme, like a sucka ballin to the devil catta
No dijo nada, con de una pallada
Im the brother wit the bald head like Mr. Clean
Settin demons on fire, tryin to put em out wit gasoline
But for some reason gasoline ain't helpin
Demons keep meltin, like a ice cream sundae
Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday
Everyday I praise the Lord, and hang demons wit my mic cord
Then I hit em wit my bat while the one the floor
Hold a sec I think I hear somebody knocin at my door
Knock Knock who's there, Jesus, Jesus who
The one who loves, and can change you, rearrange you
From the top of your head to the tip of your toes
To afros, bald heads, dread and all the stuff
Rough and rugged by my style
Like a juvenile gettin buckwild in the streets
I teach over beats
Cause thats a secret to reach ya and teach ya
So that the devil won't defeat ya
Wack MC get cut like trees, wit ease
Geez, I eat em like Chinnesse
Wak Tak Tu Ya, whats your technique
My technique is unique
Lead by the Holy Ghost
I got the type of skills that burn demons like toast
So pass the M I C and let me flow like the Atlantic
The Terminator couldn't stop me, cause I'ma crazy hispanic

[Chorus]
