MC’s, DJ’s, B-boys and Beat Makers, I’m speaking to all of ya’ll, the time is now, it’s our time!

It’s time for us to pick up tha ball and run with it: to rise up and rhyme for what we believe in. We believe in “live and let live” We believe that what we’re doing is right, and right will always win against wrong

We been doing this thang so long, singing tha same old song, we couldn’t do nothing but get strong. Ah, Don’t look at me like crazy, Think about it, even Tech and Sway be trying to wake you up from they radio station, A sleeping nation and generation. Wake up and smell the coffee

I’m calling out to all the disenfranchised, Blacks, Whites, Asians and Latinos, Join me in this fight against corruption in entertainment, Politics, religious rituals and Music

I say stop all the violence, stop all the cursing, stop all the killing, and lets become one in this conscious state of hip-hop
