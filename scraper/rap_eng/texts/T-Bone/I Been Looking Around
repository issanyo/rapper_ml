Growing up we didn't have much
I still remember mom in the welfare line
Pops on the corner slanging flowers trying to make a dime
Hustling hard, working beyond a nine to five
Praying somebody stop but cars just keep passing him by
My older sister ran away and chose a life of crime
My younger sister getting calls from these older guys
I still hear the sound of them sirens running through my mind
Saw grandma die in a stretcher before my very eyes
And who could forget the flames coming outta my room
Wit firefighters trying to save everything that ain't ruined
It's bad enough we barely making ends meet
Now we ain't even got a blanket or a place to sleep, man
We all been through struggles and em' harder times
And at times it seems like there ain't no peace of mind
But just, when I started to doubt, thinking nobody cares
I looked up and found that you was always right there

Chorus
Still looking for, keep looking for
Out searching, nothing working, steady looking for…
Still waiting for, keep waiting for
True love, one love, what we waiting for…

Moved to Southern Cali and bought me a baller crib
Wit marble floors, high ceilings and a pool to swim
I got a, lot of famous high profile friends
A white Benz laced wit them chrome spinning rims
Top dollar brand fashion and a Jacob watch
Bracelet wit canaries and em flawless rocks
I went from playa hated to Grammy nominated
To making movies wit Cuba and Beyonce now they say I made it
Finally got my music making all the headlines
Radio spinning my single back to back 10 times
But still it wasn't everything that I thought it be
Found me searching for love and life's remedy
Money bought me cars, power and yachts
I'm still distraught, got my stomach tangled in knots
Sad and depressed, finally after everything I been through
I found out the only thing that was missing was you

We all pretty much looking for the same thang
We soul searching trying get through life's long maze
I been to mountain tops looking for the most high
So many valleys lows, never thought I'd get by
So many shattered dreams, all the broken promises
Lied to, left for dead, emotional apocalypse
We all looking for the answers of what and why
Choose win or loose in this life we can live or die
And never fill that empty space that we feel inside
I know ya hurting, see the pain written in ya eyes
Tried the drugs, tarot cards, and astrology
Blaze up the purple haze, transcend reality
Trying leave all of your problems behind
And some of yall put ya faith a nine
I got mine when I, gave up tha life
Swapped it out for the better one
Finally found true wealth, Never gonna find myself…
