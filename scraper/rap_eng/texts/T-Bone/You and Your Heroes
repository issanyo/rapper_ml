[Intro and Chorus]
Come on, y'all..
Elvis - Buck him with my shotgun
Elvis - Buck him with my shotgun
Elvis - Buck him with my shotgun
Elvis - Buck him with my shotgun
Elvis - Buck him with my shotgun
Elvis - Buck Buck Buck Buck Buck Buck

[Verse 1: J-Dee & T-Bone]

Does Polly want a cracker? Fuck no, he's a zero
And I ain't with the redneck hero
I'm glad that Lincoln got bucked in the face
We should have been free in the first place
Now, let me drop it like it should be dropped
And watch Rocky Marciano's assed get mopped (word)
Madonna, you motherfuckin' slut
You could show your butt, and Jimmy still won't get up (word)
The Beatles, I just can't fade
Get the motherfuckin' raid, Bone, we got roaches
And Fonzie can't rumble
And by the way you can have Bryant Gumbel
Babe Ruth was good against the white boys
But he couldn't hit a nigga like Doc Gooden
Marilyn Monroe was a ho for the Kennedy's
Don't worry, J-Dee know the enemies
And I'll point 'em out if you don't know 'em
And tell Uncle Sam that I'm lookin' for 'em
'Cause I don't bow down to no zeroes
And I'll say - fuck you and your heroes!

[Chorus]
Elvis - Buck him with my shotgun
Elvis - Buck him with my shotgun

[T-Bone]
I'll snap your red-assed neck you motherfuckin' perpetratin' bitch

Buck him with my shotgun

[Verse 2: J-Dee & T-Bone]

Now, who's the next maggot
George Washington, he wore a wig like a faggot
Just like Rock Hudson (yeah)
Him and Liberace both like butts and dicks
Gobbled up nuts like chicks
T-Bone's on the motherfuckin' mix
Don't talk about Bird and all of his scorin' (shit)
'Cause I'll say Magic, Ewing, Jordan
Olajuwon, Isiah and Barkley
Now, bitch don't start me
You ask me did I like Arsenio (Cube tell 'em)
Motherfucker, no
Take it from Da Lench Mob (yes)
Elvis is dead as a doorknob
Never been caught for all the songs he stole
And you put James Brown on parole?
I know the deal, you hate to see a Black face
Win the motherfuckin' race
Cause you still think we're Negroes
But I'll say - fuck you and your heroes!

DJ fuckin' with the beat (yeah)
