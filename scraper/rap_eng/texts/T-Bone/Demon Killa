Whats happening big baby?
It's the Boney Bone Corleone back up in your face
Man, Ephesians 4:29 says, "Let no corrupt communication proceed
Out of your mouth, but that which is good for the use of edifying
That it may minister grace unto the hearers"

And that's exactly what I am going to do on this track mang
This one going out to all the pimps, hustlers
All them thugs out there trying to live that crazy life
Man P Game on this track partner, this one for you

When I was chilling with my homies slanging drugs
Lounging with the players and the thugs
I used to make that skrilla
But now a demon killa'

When I was chilling with my homies slanging drugs
Lounging with the players and the thugs
I used to make that skrilla
But now a demon killa'

I be that lyrical miracle spiritual eating these demons like a cereal
Redeemed criminal, to say the minimal
I got the feeling though even all left in the circle
The pain ain't gonna be, 'cause you let me go

I got subliminal messages in my mind telling me to kill myself
And if I want to be rich to go
Saying lyrics to die on the line for the wealth
But that's when I felt Holy Ghost come upon me

Trying to call me, tell me the Devil want to rob me
But God want to draw me
Plus, through Him enough to other been through
Not unless He wanna call me

I don't want to fall G so I gotta pray every day
And it's got to keep all the playa haters away
And even when I don't feel like raising my hands
I gotta do it anyways

'Cause I don't live by the feeling
Let me tell you about Christ heathen
He saved me while I was hanging on the streets
With the pimps and thugs

My deal was drug dealing and stealing
So now I be killing them unexpected spirits
That trying to get me to turn away
From the path of the Lord, 'cause the Lord is my Savior

But the Devil want to see my soul decay
That's why I gotta stay, in the Word of God
'Cause there ain't no demon in hell gonna hold me back
As long as I keep my mind and heart concentrated

Uh, I know he got my back
But the thing is the bigger the harder the trial to overcome
The bigger the blessing is when I get to heaven
So don't give up when you going through a trial
Got a smile even through the hard times

'Cause here's why, I'm trying to let you know
That you ain't alone 'cause I been there too
And in the end I'm going to let you know
That Jesus Christ chrome be the only one that stick
'Cause I put my frame, so now I put down my pen

When I was chilling with my homies slanging drugs
Lounging with the players and the thugs
I used to make that skrilla
But now a demon killa'

When I was chilling with my homies slanging drugs
Lounging with the players and the thugs
I used to make that skrilla
But now a demon killa'

I had disappointments in my life, I ain't gonna lie
Sometimes I wanted to take my own life
But thanks be to Jesus Christ 'cause He showed me
He could relieve with the truth and the light

So now in the night, when the Devil trying to tell me
There ain't nothing worth living for
I tell 'em get back Satan 'cause you is lying
In the name of Jesus I'ma leave a word tag on your toe

How you gonna do that? I'm going to put on
The full armor of my God, if you know what I mean
No I don't, okay well get the cage of he
And be the thing read Ephesians 6, 10 through 18

Now strap on your bullet proof vest
What, that be the best bet of righteousness
Why I need this? 'Cause the Devil ain't playing homeboy
He gonna try to throw all these rounds to the chest

Coming out the west, he naive the Devil
Got a stick that'll make me bleed
But hold up, I'm the one with the Devil, let you show soul
How he gonna leave them holes like a donut

Take off in the thrower, my gang sign
'Cause I'm down with the O R to the C
And if you didn't know that Boney bone be 'bout it 'bout
It just like that homie named Master P

Come along with me if you want to hear about the one
Who healed the sick and made the blind see
The one who changed water to wine, the multiple fishes
The lady with the issue of blood to cure leprosy

And who can it be, coming with the lyrical side
You ain't never heard before like this?
Try to member this, it's the only I dis
'Cause the way of preaching thugged out with a gangster twist

When I was chilling with my homies slanging drugs
Lounging with the players and the thugs
I used to make that skrilla
But now a demon killa'

Chilling with my homies slanging drugs
Lounging with the players and the thugs
I used to make that skrilla
But now a demon killa'

When I was chillin' with my homies slanging drugs
Lounging with the players and the thugs
I used to make that skrilla
But now a demon killa'

Chillin' with my homies slanging drugs
Lounging with the players and the thugs
I used to make that skrilla
But now a demon killa'
