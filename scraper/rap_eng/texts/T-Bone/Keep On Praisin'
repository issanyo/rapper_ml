Chorus:
Keep on praisin', liftin' up your name, to live in Christ, to die is gain
Repeat

Verse:
Growin' up in the cold world this industry's cloggin' up my brain, got
Memories of when gospel rap wasn't about money or the fame. Remember when it
Used to be strictly ministry? Now it's all about who's at the top of the
Industry. Everyone is jealous, full of hate, greed, and envy, now-a-days, I
Don't even know who my own friends be. Be critized, talked about and stabbed
Behind my back and playa haters still tryin' to bag gospel rap. My heart goes
Out to the streets, I'm to reach a thugs and that is why you be warmin' up the
Church seats. But you don't hear me though, turn and look the other way, but
That's OK, I know God would listen to what I gotta say. I can't lie though
At times I feel like givin' up when all this hurt n' pain inside me starts
Buildin' up. I start cryin', but God shows me love, even if I never, ever win
The dove, Im'a keep on praisin'!
Chorus
Pick up my cross and Im'a follow you, even if my boys stay behind and I'm the
Only one in my crew. To be man enough to say, "God here I am." But people
Always quick to judge, they don't understand. They talkin' about I ain't
Real, but who are you to judge me? God be the only one who knows just what I
Feel. So many rappers now-a-days, caught up in competition, that's why gospel
Rap be full of so much division. Believe me when I say, it breaks my heart to
Think that we was once in unity, but now we're all but torn apart. It's not
About how many records we've sold, it's all about how many save souls. Can
You feel me? Tears ran down my eyes yesterday as I heard about 2-Pac's death
Is there anyone left to say, "Lord, Im'a stand in the gap." My peoples, is
You with me, where you at, cause Im'a keep on praisin'!
Chorus
And even though they critizize me, talk behind my back, and tell me hurtful
Words. Till the day I'm dead, and in my grave, it's God I'm gonna' serve. So
Go ahead and talk about me and spread your lies. You the one accountable for
Every tear when I cry. I shed so many tears for so many years, God can you
Help me? I'm tryin' to reach all my peers and if you don't hear, Im'a try
Harder, even if I die from bulletshots like a martyr. This world be drivin'
Me hysterical, God I need a miracle, devil keep tryin' to hit me when I wanna
Get 'em spiritual, lyrically, I'm praisin' God with every word that I speak
You heard me, but I gotta turn the other cheek. 'Cause vengence ain't mine
Vengence belongs to the Lord. We gotta come together, one mind and one
Accord. So to those who have ears, let 'em listen to what I'm sayin' but even
Without you Im'a keep on praisin'!
