[Verse 1]
This is strictly for them low low’s, el Caminos and Chevrolet Impalas
Bouncing from California all the way to Nicaragua
Sixteen switches, rides is vicious
Bouncing like bad checks, Candy Apple, licorice
Twirling a hundred spokes, this one’s for my folks
Blacks, Filipinos, Caucasians, Latinos
Gotta know the rules when you up in this game
If you want a piece of the street, fast and furious fame
Then yo, mira bro, first off pinta lo, see them windows dawg, tinta lo
Juice it up wit hydraulics then brinca lo
Blast this in the fosgate and let the speakers blow
In the, Escalade, then escapade, like Janet
To the car show, pump the breaks
Take first place, smile, then collect the cake
Call up the homie E-Dogg, then it’s time to shake

[Chorus]
Bounce, bounce
Cadillac trucks and jeeps
From the Bronx to the Compton streets
For the clubs, mix shows, and my peeps (yeaahhh)
Now everybody bounce
Cadillac trucks and jeeps
From the Bronx to the Compton streets
For the clubs, mix shows, and my peeps (yeaahhh)
Now everybody bounce

[Verse 2]
I been know to bring the heat to the instrumental, check the credentials
My fundamentals essentials for reaching killas and thug generals
In the street where they packing the heat, creep
Throw up ‘em gang signs and C-walk to the beat, strictly
Preaching the word to those smoking the herb
Sharing the real for ‘em dealers serving crack on the curb, swerve
To the left then I scrape my plates
Now I’m dipping hopping initiating sparks on the interstate
Feels so great in the Golden State
Cool breeze from the ocean on the Golden Gate
I can’t wait for the weekend, we can make it a date
Motorola 2 way the homies, tell ‘em meet me at eight
At the studio so we can blaze the track
Like Kobe and Shaq, with back to back platinum tracks
We ain’t quitting y’all, yo we bringing the heat
Like Pacino and Luchiano for the thugs in the street

[Chorus]
Bounce, bounce
Cadillac trucks and jeeps
From the Bronx to the Compton streets
For the clubs, mix shows, and my peeps (yeaahhh)
Now everybody bounce
Cadillac trucks and jeeps
From the Bronx to the Compton streets
For the clubs, mix shows, and my peeps (yeaahhh)
Now everybody bounce

[Bridge]
Micromorphic music!!
We dippin’ hittin’ switches bounce in Cali’s trucks and Lincolns
Hypnophonic music!!
Drop ‘em clean ‘em lace ‘em up with rims and bangin’ systems

[Verse 3]
Now if ya feeling what I’m saying throw ya hands in the sky
Party people from California all the way to Hawaii
ATL and South Beach where the mamis look fine
To the streets of Spanish Harlem for my peeps in NY
Mexicano o cubano, panameño, columbiano, argentino, chileno, nicoya o puertorriqueño
Yo, it don’t really matter, this a T-Bone party
So throw ya hands up in the sky, mama move ya body
No Bacardi, Hennessey, Chronic, beer or Chocolate tie
Why? ‘Cause this is how we do it when we naturally high
Now watch me rock like Nirvana, what up mama
I’m the don dada known to mix it up like Santana

[Chorus]
Bounce, bounce
Cadillac trucks and jeeps
From the Bronx to the Compton streets
For the clubs, mix shows, and my peeps (yeaahhh)
Now everybody bounce
Cadillac trucks and jeeps
From the Bronx to the Compton streets
For the clubs, mix shows, and my peeps (yeaahhh)
Now everybody bounce
