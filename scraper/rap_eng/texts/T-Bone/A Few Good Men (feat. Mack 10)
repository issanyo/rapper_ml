Strap up the boots, I'm ready to shoot
Load the ammo, Bone Soprano wit Glocks and green camo
I play rappers like they grand pianos, a general
Call shots like I'm Joe Bonanno, what, The West is back
Sep this dude ain't black, he Latino dogg and rock Gringos
Black, Indians, Palestinians, and Phillipinos, and cash money like Vegas casinos
I'm armed and ready, palms is sweaty, kinda like em
Sep I got a sharp machete, and I'm quick to toss wack rappers of a levy
Words is heavy, kinda like a 6-4 Chevy, uh
Hip-Hop will never be the same, it's time for change
I'm bout to rearrange the game, ready to fight back
So when they say who's that, tell em it's just the king of the conscious rap

Chorus
See all we need is just a few good men
Cuz ain't to many left like Bone and Mack 10
We know nobody's perfect, so repent for ya sins
So ya better get it straight, cuz he's coming again
(Whisper) He's watching

Mack 10 -
I got the hood on smash homey
And though I'm ballin' full throttle
I'll never run outta gas homey
I'm so fly as the days go by I'm better
So I dump re-up and keep getting more cheddar
You know what it do
Mack 10 a savage
Got hustle in my veins so I fiend for the cabbage
Fresh baller to the end
Tell a friend and a neighbor
Ain't that I got so much flavor
It's that I got so much favor
I'm like Pac I get's down, against all odds
And you don't wanna go to war with a child of God
So if you see me in a six four
Tuck ya pistol
Plus it's on if ya miss
So be careful what ya wish for
A rhyme sayer wit respect like the mayor
Plus your arms is to short to box wit God playa
See I'm all for Jesus but I'm nothing like Mase
I'm to ghetto and gutter
But I'm covered in his grace, yea!
