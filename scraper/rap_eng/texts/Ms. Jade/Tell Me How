I still remember
The way that you'd smile
When you'd feel the ocean breeze
And when you were mine

We were talking crazy
Like forever was here
Not a worry in the world
With nothing to fear

But now things are awkward
Like hey how you been?
When I used to hold you
Like it'd never end
All of a sudden
We're not even friends
And I'm tired

Tell me how did we get here
Tell me how did we get here
Paralyzed by the fear
Tell me how did we get here
And how do we rewind

Can we go back to the day by the sea
I'm not ready to call that a memory
There's a tension in the air
And I know you can see
Every second passing
Is slowly killing me

But now things are awkward
Like hey how you been?
When I used to hold you
Like it'd never end
All of a sudden
We're not even friends
And I'm tired

Tell me how did we get here
Tell me how did we get here
Paralyzed by the fear
Tell me how did we get here
And how do we rewind

I am pretending like
I'm not losing my mind
Every time you come into my life
I need to have you
Right next to my side
For all time

Tell me how did we get here
Tell me how did we get here
Paralyzed by the fear
Tell me how did we get here
And how do we rewind
