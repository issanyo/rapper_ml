[Interlude: Lil' Flip]
Lil' Flipper, oh no

[Verse 1: Lil' Flip]
I'm stackin' my dough, it's 2:00 o'clock after the show
I ain't got a parkin' lot pimp to snatch me a ho
I just speak my mind and do what I feel (feel)
Cause it's the way I been actin' before I got my deal
I got my pimp cup, hair braided, car bladed (yup!)
I got my lime green gators on so nigga watch where you (step!)
You know I'm reppin' H-Town everywhere I go
All eyes on me when I walk through the door (ooh wee!)
When I pull up on 20's everybody like, "whoa!"
That's when I go switch whips and come back on 24's
I gotta puff the haze before I touch the stage
I need 25 grand before I touch a page
Cause I spit hot shit everytime I flow
So go get my shit when it come in the sto' (store)
Cause after the club it's the after party in my room (ha ha!)
And you know what we doin' (yeeah!)

[Hook: Lil' Mo]
Just because it's 2:00 o'clock (hey, hey!)
Don't stop the music, don't stop the music!
Just because it's 2:00 o'clock (oh, oh!)
Don't mean we have to stop
Don't stop the music, yeah, yeah!

[Verse 2: E-40]
I stay risked, I'm far from finger fucking and hickeys
I'm a grown man, different broad in every city
Pop more peas than a little bit, don't stop spit it, spit it
Off the block roll up, jetted wit it (jetted wit it)
Livin' on the West - it's hard to survive (uh)
Damn! I wish my partner Pac was alive (uh)
It'll be a whole different ball game let me explain (explain)
Niggas he never fucked wit stay screamin' his name (name)
You get your jaw wired up (uh) disrespectin' the game (respectin' the game)
Wishy-Washy niggas (uh) went against the grain
I give the world all my slang, they wanna run wit it (run wit it)
Without sayin' 40 Water and Sick Wid It (Sick Wid It)
See I don't sound like (uh) everybody else, I'm full of my own (who?)
Who without sin? Man, they catch the first stone
So when you cats bust a left (uh), I'm makin' a right (right)
And just because it's 2:00 o'clock, that ain't the end of the night
Biatch! (ahh!), uh (uh)

[Hook: Lil' Mo]

[Verse 3: Lil' Flip]
I ain't come to dance, I came to chill (I came to chill)
So it ain't no need to ice real, cause I got a ice grill (bling!)
My life real cause that's all I know (that's all I know)
Cali weed, yes indeed that's all I blow (that's all I blow)
If you don't know now ya know, we the big shots (yeeah!)
