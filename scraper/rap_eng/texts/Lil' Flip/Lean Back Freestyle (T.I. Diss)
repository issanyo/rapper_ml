First of all I'm a Clover G veteran
And y'all already know who I'm better than
Y'all know T.I. can't fuck with me
You're a featherweight, you don't even weigh a buck 50
Nigga you lucky my plane got delayed
Cause I would've knocked your punk ass off the stage
You a seven-time fellon, what you care about a case?
Yeah you got outta jail early cause you working with the state snitch
You a bitch, been a bitch, still a bitch
And yeah that leprechaun suit got me filthy rich
I shoulda known you was a snake
When you was at the source photoshoot smiling in my face
Tryna get on my Game Over remix but I told you no
I only do tracks with niggas that I think dope
Niggas know in the streets I'm the hardest
So why in the fuck would I diss a gold artist?
I'm from the durty durty and I represent
I get head like the muthafuckin' president
Southside and we ride on  20 inches
I got a million dollars, I ain't a penny pincher
Holla Back, I'm straight from the streets
Jump out the jeep with a K in the heat
Put the (?) in ya lap, ya brain in ya lap
Im reppin H-Town I put the clover on the map
Holla back, I got my 9 and my strap
Everybody, you betta get the hell back
When Flip pops up I'll leave your ass droppin' dead
Southside, we don't trip over blue and red
I leave you crippled with by pistol at your back bend
Make ya chest do a fuckin' back bend
Holla back I'm from the streets dawg
And I'll knock yo ass off yo feet dawg
What's beef? Beef is when a nigga like you can't eat
Wake up with no apatite and you can't eat
Better Look both ways when you walk in the street
Cause you don't wanna bump heads with a nigga like me
Rubber man with the AK shit
But your first album flopped with that Reggae shit
Holla back nigga, hahaha
