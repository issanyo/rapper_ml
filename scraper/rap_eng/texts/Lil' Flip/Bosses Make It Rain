Chorus:
Ohh we make it rain in the club (Uh-huh)
Buy out the bar (This what we do man)
Everythang on us
We make it rain (Everyday we make it rain)
We make it rain (Me and gutta make it rain)
We make it rain in the club
Me and my niggas everyday showin love
We make it rain
We make it rain
Cause that's what bosses do

Verse 1:
I used to make it rain
But now your boy hurricane
As matter fact my new tennis shoes hurricanes
The all brown ones dog i keep a fresh perm
You see shorty right thurr with the long huur
I want her to give me a lapdance
That ass so fat i had to grab it with both hands
I ordered 2 bottles
And 3000 dollars
Fuck it i'ma spend it all like i hit the lotto (ohh we make it)
Boss like ross
With a 5 acre house
With homie for 12 years
I've been gettin it in the south
The chain frost bite
The bentley off white
After i hit her man
Shawty can't walk right
They all know me on a first name basis
I'm at the blue flame with 12 briefcases
And for these hundreds
These hoes will do the matrix
I love the strip clubs
Where they get butt naked

Chorus:
Ohh we make it rain in the club
Buy out the bar
Everythang on us
We make it rain
We make it rain
Ooh we make it rain in the club
Me and my niggas everyday showin love
We make it rain
We make it rain
Cause that's what bosses do

Verse 2:
I'ma make money
While you niggas making petty quotes
You can make it rain
I make it flood like a ??? boat
Money over bitches
Paper control my whereabouts
Somebody different now
I'm tryin to break that new maclarin out
Hustle all year long
Nothin comes in front of that
Rap, Real Estate and work
I can make a ton with that
I can't fuck with you
If our goals not common
Sense dollars comma after comma (ohh we make it)
Holla at my accountant
Tell her get my taxes straight
The country in recession
I'm still hoppin on a jet today
Stuntin on your bitches
Like the motherfuckin bird man
Roadside service
I can bring it to your curb man
Yeah you heard me
I'm clean like detergent
And lookin for a head doctor a brain surgeon
Pay me in advance or i'm not comin
Like Pain, Wayne and Mac Mayne
I got money

Chorus:
Ohh we make it rain in the club
Buy out the bar
Everythang on us
We make it rain
We make it rain
Ooh we make it rain in the club
Me and my niggas everyday showin love
We make it rain
We make it rain
Cause that's what bosses do

Verse 3:
I came in the door
I said it before
Bitch i make it pacman jones on the floor
You see my ora
To keep the bitches comin back
I keep her sweatin
Like she did 300 jumpin jacks
Im known for dumpin gats
And pumpin crack daily
And if i don't know you
It's F-U pay me
I hoes crowd around me
Like i'm the fuckin pope
I let em lick the lollipop
I can't tell em no
I keep the yellow dro
Cross brim with watermelon
You call it gettin hit
I call it getting cerebellum
From D L'm funky town we make it rain
I'm blowin chains switchin lanes
Chevy lil wayne
Pussy must have blended in with T-Pain
Chopped and screwed
All my women in my pimp house a dub
With flip and screw
You can't tell what's old
Now stand back
Cause i'ma make it rain in this ho

Chorus:
Ohh we make it rain in the club
Buy out the bar
Everythang on us
We make it rain
We make it rain
Ooh we make it rain in the club
Me and my niggas everyday showin love
We make it rain
We make it rain
Cause that's what bosses do
Outro:
Well, now you know
It's what bosses do man
If you that nigga
Goin to the strip club
With 100 dollars
You really don't need to be in that bitch
You really need to put that money on your child support
Becasue it's fucked up
You ridin in a motherfuckin Benz
And your little kid wearin thrift clothes
You know what im sayin
From the thrift store and shit
That shit ain't cool my nigga (ohh we make it)
If you a boss
Make it motherfuckin rain
Make it hurricane
Make that bitch katrina
Then make that bitch hurricane ike
Turn off everybody lights
I'm out

Chorus (fade):
Ohh we make it rain in the club
Buy out the bar
Everythang on us

Ooh we make it rain in the club
Me and my niggas everyday showin love

Cause that's what bosses do
