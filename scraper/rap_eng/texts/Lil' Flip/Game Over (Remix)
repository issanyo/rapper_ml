[Verse 1 - Snoop Dogg]
Bitch, what the fuck you still got your clothes on for?
Didn't you read the sign when you came through the front door?
No drawers, no bras, no laws
Just pimps and hoes and balls in your jaws
You can drink what you wanna drink, shake till it achey ache
Now make your coochie pop and get them suckas for they bank
Not me 'cause I don't pay for no nookie
I'm a pimp, bitch I gets money out your pussy
I'm fly as an eagle, livin' so illegal
Pimp out the Cadillac, blast out the Regal
Keep a ton of weed, loc everywhere that we go
I do this for my mothafuckin' peoples
Flip, bitch!

[Hook]
Flip, flip, flip, flip, flip, flip, flip, flip
Flip, flip, flip, flip, flip, flip, flip, flip
Flip, flip, flip, flip, flip, flip, flip, flip
Flip, flip, flip, flip, flip, flip, flip, flip

[Verse 2 - Game]
R.I.P. DJ Screw
Soon as I touchdown in Houston, I slow down my music
Roll a pound with Snoop and Lil Flip
Drive through the Cloverland Houston pits
Where niggas sippin' sizzurp, watchin' roosters flip
Notorious like B.I.G
So I'ma stretch my rubberbands till T.I. free
Naw, Game just started
Fat red laces in my S Dot Carters
I'll tell you where my heart is, in heaven with my lil nigga Marcus
That got shot for his Chicago Bulls starter
Regardless of the fact I got jacked for them Jordans
Pippen wore it when he dunked on Starks in the Garden
Nigga, I'm the hardest on the mic in the 'hood
If you wanna act retarded then I'm right in the 'hood
With them Nikes in the 'hood, stuffin' white in the 'hood
Sittin' on that cherry lowrider bike in the 'hood
Smoke one for Yayo 'cause when he come home the whole world gone

[Hook]

[Verse 3 - Lil Flip]
Aww, shit it's Snoop and Flip in this bitch
First you buy it, then you roll it, then you light that shit
You know I smoke like a cancer patient
I went gold in two weeks now you niggas hatin'
You got Houston and Cali on the track, yeah
Plus I know your L.A. bitch, she got my back
I make 'em bounce all across the globe
I got the Bentley GT and the baby blue robe
Oh you ain't know? My liquor 'bout to drop, boy
I'm ridin' spinners 'cause my money don't stop, boy
I got your baby momma showin' off her G string
I'm in my drop bumpin' "Nuthin' But a 'G' Thang"
I know you mad 'cause your gal love my voice, oh
I know you mad I'm on the cover of the Source, no
It's Clover G's on top of my hand
Peep the rocks on my band 'cause the game over, man

[Hook]
