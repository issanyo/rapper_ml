Ha, Freestyle King
Screwed Up Click, nigga..

[Hook: Shasta - 2x]
Can't nobody, flow like me
I'm just a fresh MC (the Freestyle King-King)
Can't nobody, outshine me
My piece bling-blind, they bling (the Freestyle King-King)

[Lil' Flip]
I did a song with H.A.W.K., I think that nigga called it Oh Yeah
I'm wearing platinum jewelry, and my tape ain't even gold yet
You know where my shows at, just keep your ears open
And if you driving please don't get caught, with your beers open
Like Dr. Dre I'm still smoking, cause all I blow is dro
We the type of niggas, that smoke on the way to see our P.O
Got a partna named C-Note, with a brother named Duke
We got hoes in every state, that like to blow us like a flute
Everybody know I flip, everybody know I sip
All I blow is hydro weed, Lil' Flip don't fuck with dip
Wrote a movie wrote the script, I'm a million dollar star
And everytime you see me, I'm with a yellow star what

And when Screw gave me the plack, niggas really hated that
But that can't be changed, playboy that's that
Like Fat Pat I'm so throwed, just look at my charms
Stop that shit is what they say, when they look at my arm
I'm iced out bopping hoes, saying where you get it
I just smile and lie, somewhere over there in Missouri City
But you know I got Johnny, working at the Flea Market
You ain't heard of Johnny, what the fuck are you retarded
He keep me looking good, from my wrist to my pinkie
Hoes can't see me, cause they always be blinking
While I'm thinking, how the fuck I'ma get under her dress
I'm the Freestyle King, nigga how you love that
