Clover G's, bitch nigga
We make them girls get down on the floor
We make them girls get down on the floor
Like a pimp, yeh, yeh

[Lil' Flip]
As I walk in the do' I'm watchin' hoes on the flo'
Niggas dressed in fake throwbacks trickin' all they dough
Me, I'm a pimp I ain't payin' for no ass
I rather be, in the Clover tryna count cash
I got alotta hoes, and they carry all my weed
You give that hoe yo money and she bring it straight to me
Got a bigger pimp cup, got a bigger Escalade
You know how we do that shit it gotta be a better way
Run the rap game used to run a crap game
Niggas can't even go low ain't that a damn shame
I blew up in a couple of years
Got drunk wid a couple of beers
Sold crack wid a couple of peers
I'm the king of the year

[Will Lean]
I make them sluts lick down on my pole
You can take a hoe of the streets but not a hoe, out a hoe
Will Lean yeh I know, and I'm all about my dough
I'm on the block everyday and I'm pushin' that snow
On the road nigga pimpin' these bitches
Niggas hittin' switches leavin' jackers up in ditches
I'm givin' niggas stitches if they fuckin' wid my dough
It's the Chemist (and Lil' Flip and we don't love them hoes)
Cause nigga I'm a pimp so hoe bring me my green
Fore I slap yo ass bitch wid my iced out pinky ring

[Hook]
We make them drops squat low on the flo'
We make them drops squat low on the flo'
Like a pimp, like a pimp
We make them girls get down on the flo'
Here we go

[Lil' Flip]
Now don't you hate them old, lyin' ass niggas
Actin' like they all gangsta
You ain't rollin' wid no triggas
That's why you ain't got no figgas
That's why you ain't got no deal
You playin' with the wrong nigga
But you ain't got no skill

[Will Lean]
Yeh for real grab the K's and kill
I got that four, fifth steel and I sprays at will
You lil bitch bust ya head, like I'm poppin' a pill
Take you out, with the chopper on top of the hill

[Lil' Flip]
We make 'em, swallow the nut so, follow the Benz
You can, call all your friends tell 'em to, swallow my friends
We can, do this again when I, come to your town
But when you see me at a show bitch don't hunt me down
When I come around I want that dro I want yo hoes
I do that show, this year, I ain't doin' no more promos

[Outro]
Haha, yeh Lil' Flipper nigga
You know Clover G's nigga
Will Lean the Chemist, Will like a pimp
I got a bigger pimp cup now
David Banner go get that nigga album nigga
You know how we do it nigga, yeh yeh yeh
Play and Skillz, check out them niggas
Oh yeh my album comin' too you gotta feel me
