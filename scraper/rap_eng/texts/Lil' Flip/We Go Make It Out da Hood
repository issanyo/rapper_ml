[Chorus: Big Shasta] - 2x
All my niggas on lock keep ya head up
My niggas on the block get ya bread up, I'ma get this cheddar
(Hey!) We go make it out the hood mayne
(Hey!) We go make it out the hood mayne

[Lil' Flip]
Yeah I made it out the hood but I still go back
To check on my fam and buy my love bro throwbacks
I came a long way, it ain't my fault you went the wrong way
And listen up I'm grown nigga, I don't play
I got show money (yeah), plus liquor money (yeah)
After I get off stage I got picture money
These rap cats ain't stickin to the G-code
You thing you fly cause you got a few free-throws
I know squares that cook O's, you damn right
And if you want it, you gotta pay the damn price
I do this for the dope boys with them AK's
I'm a fly yellow nigga like Kay-Kay

[Chorus] - 2x

[Lil' Flip]
Ay, you ain't gotta be fake I know y'all don't like me
Cause when I got shot up, y'all ain't right me
You got a chip on your shoulder, I got a clip in my holster
The difference between us, is I'm focused
Nowadays e'rybody wanna talk about me
But you know you can't mention the South without me
Record labels came, and record labels went
Pay attention to your checks, watch the money you spend
Your kids dirty, but you ride around in a Benz
Everyday at Pappadeux, trickin ya ends
It ain't the color of our skin, that hold us back
It's a fact, niggas don't know how to act
A few niggas get paid e'rybody want a piece
Shit start goin wrong e'rybody wanna leave
Record sales low e'rybody wanna beef
(No matter where I go) I keep it H double O-D

[Chorus] - 2x

[Lil' Flip]
Ay, all my niggas makin forty-five hunnid a week
We overseas blowin trees, yeah it's somethin to see
You'll never hear me say "I don't need the hood"
All my niggas gettin fat cause I feed the hood
It ain't my fault y'all niggas don't leave the hood
I did everything y'all ain't believe I could
Huh, you not ahead of me, I got longevity
I'm tryin to leave my lil' boy, a legacy
I got the recipe, you wanna make a hit
You not impressin me, talkin bout bricks
I made it out the hood, and I'm still thuggin
Accepted by Hollywood, and I'm still hustlin
And that's a goddamn shame right?
Oh well, I'm tryin to get my change right
And you'll survive, if you play the game right
I fly G-5's I ain't gotta change flights

[Chorus] - 2x
