[Intro: Man with deep voice]
I, I came to bring the pain, pain
I, I came to bring the pain, pain
I, I came to bring the pain, pain
I, I came to bring the pain, pain
I came to..
I, I came to bring the pain (grrr!) (grrr!)
I came to, I, I came to
I came to, I came to

[Hook: Lil' Flip, Tity Boi, Static]

[Lil' Flip] I came to bring the pain nigga!
[Static] And I came to bust them things nigga
[Lil' Flip] The night'll rearrange your frame nigga
[Lil' Flip] You scared nigga!
[Static] You scared nigga!
[Lil' Flip] One more time
[Lil' Flip] I came to bring the pain nigga!
[Tity Boi] And I came to change the game nigga
[Lil' Flip] The night'll rearrange your frame nigga
[Lil' Flip] You scared nigga!
[Tity Boi] You scared nigga!
[Lil' Flip] Oh oh!

[Verse 1: Lil' Flip]
Get out my face, get out my face! (you is a ho ho)
You talk behind my back, back (but I know know)
I pack a 4-4 (and I bust bust)
And I ain't leaving this mess (in hand cuffs cuffs)
You better put your hands up (what?)
Get them little budget then wrap your fans up but you still won't catch up
Cause I'm connected on the East (East), I'm connected on the West (West)
I ain't saying I'm the best (best) but I feel like I'm blessed (blessed)
I got thirty on my neck (neck) and twenty in my mouth (mouth)
But if I feel disrespected, I'm a call your ass out
They gone haul your ass out now you crying like a bitch
I told you not to fuck with the Screwed Up Clique

[Hook: Lil' Flip, Tity Boi, Static]

[Verse 2: Tity Boi]
Bring the pain, hard core, selling cane
Sun, snow, water, rain
Shorty I will flip this stuff until the task force came
Tried to rearrange the game, tried to bang, I suck at slanging
New slang I had to switch it up, wrap a pimp cursing on the track
The mack will leave you on your back, strap will leave you with a gap
Stop smiling! - glances you see visions of the past
You see niggas with masks, up in cars with no tags
When we balling! - I'm from the apartments, started with all of it
Different day same clip, so close I can't miss
Tity, Flip, Ludacris, got bricks, roosters, chicks
Snatching bread then we dip, it's South Side - represent!

[Verse 3: Ludacris]
Now the clique is called D.T.P. so get your crew right
We peer pressure fools, even +Dudley+ don't +Do-Right+
So go on your city, it's a South rebellion
We putting "foots" in your asses, how we speak Australian?
I'm trained in the art of whoop ass, check my accolades
Got a knife and I'm giving out free after shaves
Plus a new acting gig, take a look at the CLIP!
It's called one up in the chamber and four on the HIP!
I snatch your girls in the club and use them as throat throttles
Then you'll get hit with fifteen mini Moe bottles
Got Glocks for your stocks and that thing for your chain
And uh, mutual guns for your mutual funds main!

[Hook: Lil' Flip, Tity Boi, Static]

[Outro: Man with deep voice]
I came to
I, I came to bring the pain
I came to
I, I came to
I came to
I came to bring the pain
I, I came to bring the pain
