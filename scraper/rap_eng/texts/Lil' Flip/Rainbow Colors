[Hook: Lil Flip]
I got them rainbow colors in my cup
Jolly Ranchers man that shit be good as fuck
That's that syrup, motherfucker that's that syrup
That's that syrup, motherfucker that's that syrup

I got them rainbow colors in my cup
Jolly Ranchers man that shit be good as fuck
That's that syrup, motherfucker that's that syrup
That's that syrup, motherfucker that's that syrup

[Verse One: Lil' Flip]
Sippin' on syrup cause I love to lean
I'm high as fuck cause I'm puffin' green
And I got more amphetamines than Eckerds and Walgreens
I get high as I park my, park my drop on the curb
I'm smokin on that blueberry, yeah I got that good herb
And when you come to H-town just hit me on the phone
And I'ma come and pick y'all up and we gon' smoke and zone
Cause you know I got that good weed and I got that purple drank
Its one twenty for an eighth and two forty for a pint
I got money in the bank so I ball like that
Got 20's on my car, on my car like that
Hit them all like that, we ball like that
I'll fuck yo ho and won't call her back
That's how we do it baby, I gotta keep it real
Oops my bad I'm like Bun B I gotta keep it trill
And I don't pop no pills, I drop my, drop my trunk
So you can see my neon light and hear them speakers bump
They call me Lil' Flip, I'm leanin' to the left
I'm like the yin-yang twin, sippin' this, sippin' this syrup by myself

[Hook: Lil Flip]
I got them rainbow colors in my cup
Jolly Ranchers man that shit be good as fuck
That's that syrup, motherfucker that's that syrup
That's that syrup, motherfucker that's that syrup

I got them rainbow colors in my cup
Jolly Ranchers man that shit be good as fuck
That's that syrup, motherfucker that's that syrup
That's that syrup, motherfucker that's that syrup

[Verse Two: DJ Paul]
I'm zoned up and seeing double
Plus everything that I'm seeing is already double
So that's like four of you motherfuckers
I'm leanin' like I'm standin in a muddle puddle
And berry, berry, got me wanting a hash brown, ounce this, ounce this huddle
I let the seat back in my 'lac and take another sip
Then screw the top off of my bottle take this blunt and dip
Off in the syrup, my nigga ask me help me, help me for
I said you really wanna get high then this here will serve

[Verse Three: Juicy J]
What them girls know about that yellow tuss, tuss
Or them rainbow color's all mixed in a cup
That'll make your dick hard when you ready to fuck
I bet your momma told you bitch you better not fuck with us
We some cool type niggas, all we do is smoke
And we sip on syrup, sittin' on the front porch
'Till we get real dizzy, fall down on the floor
And if I get myself dippin', dippin' on some more

[Hook: Lil Flip]
I got them rainbow colors in my cup
Jolly Ranchers man that shit be good as fuck
That's that syrup, motherfucker that's that syrup
That's that syrup, motherfucker that's that syrup

I got them rainbow colors in my cup
Jolly Ranchers man that shit be good as fuck
That's that syrup, motherfucker that's that syrup
That's that syrup, motherfucker that's that syrup
