[Talking]
There's too much paper to get fuck a bitch...
There's too much paper to get fuck a bitch
It's too much paper to get, for real
But I can't count it all
Fuck being around a bitch
I wanna be around my dogs, whoo!, uh
I'll do the hook like that
Just let it play do the verse

[Verse 1]
I'm thinkin' of a master plan
Like y'all niggas movin' too slow I got a faster plan
I got a faster hand and a faster mind
Real gangstas never have to scream pass the nine
Cause we masterminds when it come to gettin' loot
In half the time, we ride around in drop top coupes
Oops I did it again another bitch in my Benz homes
When times get hard who can a nigga depend on?
A few niggas, my true niggas
From day one, DJ Screw niggas
I coulda hurt niggas but I tried to help niggas
I'm spittin' fire cause everytime I melt niggas
I got three mics plus one on my arm
The Freestyle King and the fuckin' Leprechaun
I'm from the dirty dirty, I know you niggas heard me
And if you owe me you better fuckin' reimburse me bitch
