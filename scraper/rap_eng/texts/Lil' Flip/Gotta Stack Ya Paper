(Lil'Flip)
I'm a southside playa that love to wreck
I got 25-G's above my neck
When I'm at the Cashattia I love to bet
Should I take the Corvette or the bubble lex?
I put diamonds in yo faces on a daily basis
I done wrecked T-town and club Oasis
I got three Jags in my parking spaces
'95 Air Max with blue laces
You can call me a pimp like Dolomite
I charge five G's to hold a mic
If it ain't no drank I dont hold a Sprite
After I do this I got mo' to write
I'm a stay Sucka Free thats my family
Me,Redd,Hump,Fuzz,and Anthony
Nigga we livin ya'll fantasy
And I take baths with vanity
I'm in the studio from 9 to 5
I'm a stay indepedent I ain't gon' sign with Jive
I'm eatin fettucini ya'll eatin fries
Like R.Kelly I wish I could fly
I'm a 18 year old C-E-O
My favorite movie is CB4
When you lookin at my watch see me snow
And if you want pimps here we go
You ain't know Lil'Flip is the freestyle king
I got platinum on my bezzeltyne
Stretch my money like a limousine
Ya gal hooked on me like nicotine
When I pull up to the show I'm in 16 cars
16 ice,and 16 stars
Yeah I'm spittin game to like 16 broads
I think I just wrecked these 16 bars

(Shazstar)
Maan!that boy a fool
Godamn!but

(Chorus:Shazstar rp2x)
Gotta stack ya paper
Chop em' like a razor!
If you gon'grind or if
You gonna pull papers!yeah

(Lil'Flip)
Ay I'm in a Escalade eatin Etoufee
Like Lil'Troy its a better way
I ride on red and sit on gray
Me and Ron C blow on hay
I'm playa made on razorblades
All my clothes are tailor-made
I pour a 4 in Gatorade
Watch me lean in the shade
I keep a fade I'm wearin J's
I pull more stunts than Super Dave
The reason I ball like a ball
Cause thats just for you to hate
I'm underated but anticipated money in my face
I gotta make it jump on a mic I gotta break it
A million dollars I gotta take it
I'm the millionare I'm a billionare
Check the Billboard I'm still in there
I put diamonds all in yo face so you know
Lil'Flip dont really care I play truth
Or dare with yellow bones talk on prime co telophones
Got hoes from Hiram Clark all the way to Yellowstone
And I ride on chrome thats all I do
Slow down music we call it Screw
Everyday watch out for the boys in blue
I wear Fubu and Dada too
I'm Lil'Flip I'm Sucka Free
Ten thousand ain't enough for me
Can't none of ya'll niggas fuck with me
I can't get enough of this luxury but
I'm a billionare and I'm playa made on razorblades
Lookin good chunkin up the duece
Cloverland is my hood nigga ugh!

(Chorus:Shazstar )

(Lil'Flip)
Ay they call me Lil'Flip I love to wreck
You wanna do a song I need a check
Collect my hoes like upper deck
Southside niggas get much respect
Nigga Ron C put me on the track
My nigga named Hump put me on the map
My nigga named Johnny man he gave me plat
A nigga out of line nigga he get slapped
A million dollar nigga with a million dollar mouth
A million dollar vase with a million dollar coach
Southside nigga thats what I'm about
If a nigga owe me money I'm a call him out
I'm a let a nigga know I'm the freestyle king
These niggas dont wanna step in the freestyle ring
Nigga this shit is freestyling
Nigga I'm the mothafuckin freestyle king
I said it one I said it twice
Gotta whole closet full of Nikes
Went to Worthings full of dice
You know Lil'Flip gotta lot of ice
I gotta lot of mics cause I'm in The Source
Me and Brian playin on the golf course
Nigga got a brand new Rolls Royce
Hoes give me head they got no choice
I'm a million dollar nigga thats what
I do slow down music by Watts and Screw
Everyday watch out for the boys in blue
Nigga I use to watch shots of Fubu
Million dollar nigga with DVDs,Escalades
Drop top,and GMC's before I listened
To DJ Screw I use to jam DJ Dmd Lil'Flip
Is the only star down south we just
Sip the bar 20 inches rip the car I gotta
Be real I'm a rep the toy I'm a stay
The king I'm a stay the prince I'm a get
The house with the big ol' fence and when
I write my rhymes I dont get lyric bent nigga
