(*talking*)
Yeah, Lil' Flip, I'm one deep this time
We ain't scared man, how many times I gotta
Tell you niggas we ain't scared, yeah
We keeping it gangsta (gangsta) believe that
(believe that) popping collars (popping) you know
(you know) yeah (yeah)...

[Lil' Flip]
Look I ain't scared of no nigga, I ain't scared of no hoe
I come to my show, and knock you out on the front row
You on the flo', cops coming
Lil' Flip is standing here, I'm not running
I'm a man nigga, I need ten grand nigga
If you want my verse, put it in my hand nigga
Got a Benz that's blue, got a tan Range Rover
And I like my c.d., to change over
I push Benzes, on 20 inch Lorenzes
Never get out my money, and I never will spend it
I save some, put a little away
Yeah it's a sunny day, but what about the rainy days
Cause when it's a rainy day, I gotta have that re-up
Money my nigga, cause I need my money
It ain't funny, it ain't a joke, it ain't no game
If you play with my change, I put some change on your brain
You feel me mayn, you feel my pain, I need mine
Before I sign a contract, I gotta read mine
I'm just a young nigga, can't be a dumb nigga
I'm so thoed I got game nigga, I can fuck a nun nigga
I'm Lil' Flip, and the game is perfected
I'm the referee, your ass just got ejected
I'm the President, you know my residence
I graduated '99, so I'm intelligent
I got a Navigator, I got a calculator
I know these niggas know, I got that crib with elevators
Spiral chairs, and big ole maze
I got a big Excursion, on big ole Blaze
We chop chop hoes bop bop, back in the days
Niggas use to break dance, and pop lock
Now we play hop scotch, but if you play with my money
My nigga, I come and spray or pop blocks
Break niggas take niggas, look for the fake niggas
Step on it so fast, he a cake nigga
A weak nigga, a freak nigga
I got them books, you can call me a geek nigga
Cause I'm a hustla, balla, gangsta, dope dealer
20 inch Sprewells, riding on my 4 wheeler
Just went to Mobilia, just to get mo' scrilla
I got my money, I don't depend on no nigga
Cause if I don't work, then I don't eat
Yeah I graduate, sometimes a nigga had to cheat
I cheated on my hoes, cheated on my tests
But I'm the pimp nigga, I must confess
So pay attention, when I spit my rhymes
Cause Lil' Flip, I'm always shining
Always grinding, time I was telling
Nigga my pockets swelling

[Yung Redd]
They wanna see something new, well nigga stay tuned
I cruise through, in a all blue H2
Them rims big, so I'm sitting on them shag shoes
The white kids, say the black dude is that cool
I'm such a fool, I should open up a school
And teach some of these dudes, how to ride 22's
Try to figure me out, but you don't have a clue
Just follow my lead, y'all do as I do
Yeah I'm still in your hood, like run down houses
From the burbs to the projects, we got em bouncing
Pass the swisha, I'm with my nigga Flippa
My truck sit higher than heels, on a stripper
You got a heater, better keep it with you
It's fucked up, blind niggas can't peep the picture
Plus the fo' fever, guaranteed to leave you
Flat on the pavement, taking your last breather

(*talking*)
Yeah, I had to do that for my niggas
Know I'm saying, everybody
Off the dome, off the brain
I'm all known like a pen to the pad nigga, yeah
