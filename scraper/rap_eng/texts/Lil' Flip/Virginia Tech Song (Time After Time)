[Intro]
Yeah, it's your boy Lil Flip
We just had a tragedy April 16 Monday 7:15 A.M
So I thought it would be selfish not to speak on it
So everybody who lost somebody at Virginia Tech on Monday
You can play this to help you get by
Yeah...

[Hook]
If you're lost, you can look and you will find me
(You can find me)
Time after time
(Time after time we go through stuffs like this)
If you fall, I will catch you, I will be waiting
(We keeping y'all in our prayers)
Time after time

(Chea!)
If you're lost, you can look and you will find me
(Rest in peace to everybody)
Time after time
If you fall, I will catch you, I will be waiting
(We burning candles)
Time after time

[Verse 1]
Imagine waking up for class and not knowing what about to happen to you
This is coming from the heart, Flip ain't just rapping to you
See I did been in situations kinda like this
And I know it make you wonder where Jesus Christ is
People die before they got a chance to graduate
Is it me or did the police react rather late?
Too many shot, too many guns, too many war stories
And I saw people jumping out of windows four stories
Imagine how the parents felt when they got the news
Especially when they couldn't even tell who was who
So we pray for each one of y'all who lost a child
And that brave man who escaped the holocaust
I heard the news, they said they had chains on the doors
Then later on they interviewing at the gun store
Then later on they let them classmates talk about him
But his screen play should've let you know he had a problem

[Hook]
If you're lost, you can look and you will find me
(Rest in peace)
Time after time
(It's your boy Flip Gates)
If you fall, I will catch you, I will be waiting
(I got your back)
Time after time

(Yeah)
If you're lost, you can look and you will find me
(We praying for all the families)
Time after time
(I got a white candle lit right now)
If you fall, I will catch you, I will be waiting
(Yeah)
Time after time
(Rest in peace)

[Verse 2]
We fighting wars over there but we got wars over here
I ain't gonna lie I got shot
But your boy's still here
Now my vision clear
And everybody ain't your friend
Would you want to know if you could see how your life would end
And I don't know nobody at the school
But I'm a human too
And if you care about others
That's what humans do
And even though my album out
I can take the time to grieve
Cause if I had a tragedy I hope y'all would do the same for me
So if you see me in the streets, show your boy some love (Yeah)
I'm a millionaire but I'm a educated thug
And to the people who ain't been to Virginia yet
When you come make sure you think about Virginia Tech
We lost a lot of good people on the bad day
And I know how it feel cause my cousins past away
So next time you feeling down about your situation
Just take this Lil Flip record to your local station

[Hook]
If you're lost, you can look and you will find me
(We praying for everybody)
Time after time
(Time after time)
If you fall, I will catch you (Yeah), I will be waiting
(Yeah)
Time after time

(Aye your boy Lil Flip got your back)
If you're lost, you can look and you will find me
(They can hate on me all they want)
Time after time
(How many artists are gonna take the time out to do this?)
If you fall, I will catch you, I will be waiting
(I live in the studio)
Time after time
(Yeah)

[Outro]
We dedicated this to everybody who lost somebody they love
Brother, sister, cousin, nephew, husband, wife, son, daughter, aunt, uncle
Grandfather, grandmother, everybody on September 11th
Everybody at Virginia Tech, everybody man
It's your boy Flip gangster, your number one fly boy
Aye, this' how I do it baby
