[Lil' Flip talking]
Ah, yeah
Lil' Flip, this for the ladies though
Yeah, this for the ladies

[Chorus: Lil' Flip]
I cut 4 you, but girl, I got things to do
I bet you wonderin' what I'm doin' when I ain't with you
I got money to make, I got places to go
So you ain't gotta worry if I'm out chasin' hoes
I cut 4 you, but girl, I got things to do
I bet you wonderin' what I'm doin' when I ain't with you
I got money to make, I got places to go
So you ain't gotta worry if I'm out chasin' hoes
I cut 4 you

[Verse One: Lil' Flip]
I tell you wear a nigga's boxers and ya hottie top
Would you like me if I didn't have a Jag off the lot
And when I hit the mall and shop I'm buyin' all the socks
And if I got into some trouble, would you call the cops?
I need a ride or die chick like the LOS, that know how to drive a stick in a yellow 'Vette
I need a gal that know how to pull a silly stunts
I need a gal that know how to roll Philly blunts
And if I wanna drank, she gon' hold my ace
And if I ever get locked up, she gon' promote my tapes
She understand when a nigga say I “gotta show”
And when say “I gotta show”, that means that I gotta go
I'm tellin' you all this right know, because I gotta know
Are you down wit' me, because I gotta lotta dough
And 'cause all of my jewelry gotta lotta snow
“What you need Flip?”
Girl, not a hoe

[Chorus: Lil' Flip]
I cut 4 you, but girl, I got things to do
I bet you wonderin' what I'm doin' when I ain't with you
I got money to make, I got places to go
So you ain't gotta worry if I'm out chasin' hoes
I cut 4 you, but girl, I got things to do
I bet you wonderin' what I'm doin' when I ain't with you
I got money to make, I got places to go
So you ain't gotta worry if I'm out chasin' hoes
I cut 4 you

[Verse Two: Lil' Flip]
I only like fine woman like Destiny's child
And if I say “I'm Lil' Flip”, I bet she'll smile
I don't believe in buyin' drinks, but I can show you a mic
You don't believe my teeth cost, then I can show you the  price
I paid twenty on my teeth, I paid fifty on my piece
And you don't wanna know how much I paid for my Bentley (How much?)
But it don't matter, girl, I got mo' money than Bill Gates
And I'ma stay paid as long as my record's still playin'
But niggas still hatin', 'cause they gotta broad with no flows
And they're with a chicken head with no job and no car
Hold on, girl, be quiet
I think I heard my phone
“Lil' Flip we gotta show”
You can go out wit' ya friends I'ma do my own thing

[Chorus: Lil' Flip]
I cut 4 you, but girl, I got things to do
I bet you wonderin' what I'm doin' when I ain't with you
I got money to make, I got places to go
So you ain't gotta worry if I'm out chasin' hoes
I cut 4 you, but girl, I got things to do
I bet you wonderin' what I'm doin' when I ain't with you
I got money to make, I got places to go
So you ain't gotta worry if I'm out chasin' hoes
I cut 4 you

[Verse Three: Lil' Flip]
And I don't give my dough and I got lick 'em low
And if your friends don't like me, forget them hoes
I got you drivin' navigators and drivin' sports cars
I got you steppin' out the house in Gucci sports bra's
I got you doin' a lotta stuff that you didn't use to do
I got you wearin' baggets the size of a rubies Q
I got you takin' vacation while I'm playin' playstation
You heard, I was with another girl

[Flip]
Baby they just hatin', keep waitin' pretty soon
We gon' spend some time, but if I wanna stay paid I have to spit rhymes
So if you done with me baby, then it ain't no problem
And we can ride side by side, like Batman and Robin

[Chorus: Lil' Flip ]
I cut 4 you, but girl, I got things to do
I bet you wonderin' what I'm doin' when I ain't with you
I got money to make, I got places to go
So you ain't gotta worry if I'm out chasin' hoes
I cut 4 you, but girl, I got things to do
I bet you wonderin' what I'm doin' when I ain't with you
I got money to make, I got places to go
So you ain't gotta worry if I'm out chasin' hoes
I cut 4 you
