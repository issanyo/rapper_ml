(feat. Robin Andre)

[Chorus:]
Tell me why
I can't see where I'm goin
No
When everybody else sees
Where I'm comin from
And I don't know why
I travel down these dead end roads
I gotta turn this car around
And find my way home

[Lil Flip:]
Will you listen to my music do you feel my shit
Look I don't need punch lines cuz I live my shit
A lot of cats sellin their soul for radio play
That's why we need more rappers like Common n Kanye
Nigga scared to be broke so they fake it to make it
If my album went gold I'd still be the greatest
Back in the days I would get caught for truency
But now I'm puttin money back in my community
I took my homies out the hood n now they got jobs
Cuz there's more to life then dodgin cop cars
I played the block hard n now I play the pop charts
But now I'm getting dumb money cuz I got smart

[Chorus:]
Tell me why
I can't see where I'm goin
No
When everybody else sees
Where I'm comin from
And I don't know why
I travel down these dead end roads
I gotta turn this car around
And find my way home

[Lil Flip:]
Hey yo I never seen a man cry til I seen a man die
So when you talk to me look me in my damn eyes
Cuz I been through it all and my scars prove it
Cuz when it come to that paper homie Ima do it
I just rhyme part time you better know it
These lines commin from my mind so I never wrote it
I keep my nine by my spine so I never show it
Yeah im addicted to pine but I never grow it
And the reason I got signed is cuz im a poet
Half of my niggas doin time but im focused
Thats why im stayin on the grind if u haven't noticed
That old cadillac transformed fully loaded

[Chorus:]
Tell me why
I can't see where I'm goin
No
When everybody else sees
Where I'm comin from
And I don't know why
I travel down these dead end roads
I gotta turn this car around
And find my way home

When ya new album drop everybody ya friend
Niggas actin like they down but I know they pretend
I used to scrape up money for studio time
I'm like Jay-Z homie I remember my rhymes
Ain't nobody helped me out when my cash was low
My bills commin to fast so I had to blow
And I walked by fate not by sight
Cuz I know G-O-D will guide me right
I take the bitter with the sweet I know u feel my pain
Why we gotta get harassed when we board the plane
I ain't tryin to preach to ya but I hope you relate
Cuz even at a dead end you gotta find your way
OK
OK

[Chorus:]
Tell me why
I can't see where I'm goin
No
When everybody else sees
Where I'm comin from
And I don't know why
I travel down these dead end roads
I gotta turn this car around
And find my way home

[Lil Flip: talking]
Yeah
I wanna dedicate this track right here to my grandparents
You know
They stuck with me
Through thick n thin
You know what I'm sayin since day one
I got my family
You know I ain't got no back problem
So I dedicated this to you
Pray to God you gonna find a way
Holla back
