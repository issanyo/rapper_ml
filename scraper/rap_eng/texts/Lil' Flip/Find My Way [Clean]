No where to go down these dead end roads
I tried to flee just to free my soul
It's a section, which way to go
I don't know
I tried the highways but the highway's closed
Now I'm blinded by a dusty road
Uncertain which way to go
To find my way back home to Texas
Yeah, I want you to walk with me
I done been through a lot of struggles
Lot of ups and downs
Y'all think it's a cake walk, you're wrong
Tell me why I can't see where I'm goin'
No, when everybody else sees where I'm comin' from
And I don't know why I travel down these dead end roads
I gotta turn this car around and find my way home
Will you listen to my music do you feel my s***?
Look I don't need punch lines 'cuz I live my s***
A lot of cats sellin' their soul for radio play
That's why we need more rappers like Common 'n' Kanye
N*** scared to be broke so they fake it to make it
If my album went gold I'd still be the greatest
Back in the days I would get caught for truancy
But now I'm puttin' money back in my community
I took my homies out the hood, now they got jobs
'Cuz there's more to life then dodgin' cop cars
I played the block hard n now I play the pop charts
But now I'm getting dumb money 'cuz I got smart
Tell me why I can't see where I'm goin'
No, when everybody else sees where I'm comin' from
And I don't know why I travel down these dead end roads
I gotta turn this car around and find my way home
Hey, yo, I never seen a man cry 'til I seen a man die
So when you talk to me look me in my damn eyes
'Cuz I been through it all and my scars prove it
'Cuz when it come to that paper, homie, I'ma do it
I just rhyme part time, you better know it
These lines comin' from my mind so I never wrote it
I keep my n*** by my spine so I never show it
Yeah, I'm addicted to p*** but I never grow it
And the reason I got signed, 'cuz I'm a poet
Half of my n*** doin' time but I'm focused
Thats why I'm stayin' on the grind if you haven't noticed
That old nine nine transformed fully loaded
Tell me why I can't see where I'm goin'
No, when everybody else sees where I'm comin' from
And I don't know why I travel down these dead end roads
I gotta turn this car around and find my way home
When your new album drop everybody your friend
N*** actin' like they down but I know they pretend
I used to scrape up money for studio time
I'm like Jay-Z, homie, I remember my rhymes
Ain't nobody helped me out when my cash was low
My bills comin' too fast so I had to blow
And I walked by fate not by sight
'Cuz I know G O D will guide me right
I take the bitter with the sweet, I know u feel my pain
Why we gotta get harassed when we board the plane?
I ain't tryin' to preach to you but I hope you relate
'Cuz even at a dead end you gotta find your way, okay, okay
Tell me why I can't see where I'm goin'
No, when everybody else sees where I'm comin' from
And I don't know why I travel down these dead end roads
I gotta turn this car around and find my way home
I like dedicate this track to my grandparents
They stuck by n*** through thick and thin
You know when I started doin' this rap music
They was givin' me money to go to the studio to do my demos
Long as I got my family I'm straight
They gon' be around even if I ain't got a hit
You dig what I'm sayin'?
So even at a dead end you gotta find your way
Free Z-Ro, welcome home, butterman, you
