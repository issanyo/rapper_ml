[Chorus: Takeoff]
Your bitch in my kitchen, she snorting
The lean I’m pouring, I’m snoring
I’m making them plays in Delaware
Versace, Medusa my underwear
Your bitch in my kitchen, she snorting
The lean I’m pouring, I’m snoring
I’m making them plays in Delaware
Versace, Medusa my underwear
Shoot a fuck nigga, better have healthcare
Don’t trap on the block if you don’t live there
The trap be jumping and bucking
The fiends they run in, the money keep coming
Shoot a fuck nigga, better have healthcare
Don’t trap on the block if you don’t live there
The trap be jumping and bucking
The fiends they run in, the money keep coming

[Verse 1: Lil Flip]
I had a condo at fifteen
My guns they all machines
It’s twenty chickens in the kitchen
My girl cook like Paula Dean
My bitch ball off the leash
It’s blue and platinum seats
I got the hook up with the cook up
Plus I move them Master P’s
Twenty-five lighters on my dresser
Yes I dress up all my roster
Exterior plain jane but you can see the hole inside
These youngsters poppin’ mollys
My shooters smoking D’s
And they got clovers on they shoulders
So you know they shoot for free
Codeine in my Fanta
Molly all on my tounge
That pistol off on my right side
That purple all in my lungs
Keep a strap with a chopper like Mad Max
Trap house mad stacked, where the cash at
Fuck nigga better duck like Aflac
‘cause I’m chasing the cheese like a lab rat
East side, I’m from there
So you know that I sold my drugs there
Got a bad bitch from England
She got an attitude and long hair
I can get a whole brick on that scale nigga
Bitch I’m fresh out of jail nigga
Beat a gun charge and made bail nigga
On probation blowing L’s nigga

[Chorus: Takeoff]
Your bitch in my kitchen, she snorting
The lean I’m pouring, I’m snoring
I’m making them plays in Delaware
Versace, Medusa my underwear
Your bitch in my kitchen, she snorting
The lean I’m pouring, I’m snoring
I’m making them plays in Delaware
Versace, Medusa my underwear
Shoot a fuck nigga, better have healthcare
Don’t trap on the block if you don’t live there
The trap be jumping and bucking
The fiends they run in, the money keep coming
Shoot a fuck nigga, better have healthcare
Don’t trap on the block if you don’t live there
The trap be jumping and bucking
The fiends they run in, the money keep coming

[Verse 2: Frenchie]
My underwear, you know we got money here
So if you act funny here
And run off with bread
Nigga I aim at your head, nigga we got them [?]
Fuck with the Migos
They say they got kilos
I’m calling my nigga named Offset
You know he with Quavo
Shootin’ out the window
Why the fuck you ain’t duck?
You see me fly by nigga
And you seen a lot of these movies
Stupid, you know about a drive-by nigga
You would think I was a trap nigga
Nah, I’m getting money off of rap nigga
I don’t gotta touch no drugs
In the club, get your head money wrapped nigga
I don’t got a lot of these hoes
Bitch look in the sky, it’s rainin’ them fifties and hundreds
I love it
Money is stacking and stacking, it’s crazy
So every time I take your bitch out she tell me she love it
It’s funny
