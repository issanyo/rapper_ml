[Verse 1]

I'ma tell you like this
You a bitch and I know it
How you get out of jail early?
You a snitch, I can show it
There go my dick
You can blow it since it stay on your mind
I know niggas that don't like you
Then stay in your time

**Beat stops**
Lil Flip talking:
This yo boy Lil Flip man
With DJ Ideal, it's part two of this shit man
Y'all keep y'all ears open man
We ain't droppin nothing but the hot shit
*gun click* Now who they want?
Flip, biatch!

**Beat continues**

I know about your mixtape
And verse on Trick shit
Nigga I'm a warrior, you are just a misfit, get it?
A black fitted, black gloves and black [?]
The difference between me and you is I pack clubs
I had a traffic packed up, 23 blocks
My entourage pulling up in 23 drops
And everybody on my team got a nice watch
They got their own chains
Plus I gave 'em all gang
You told Atlantic not to flip the verse you did for Buck
And Ludacris murdered your ass, niggas know you
But old ass kissin' nigga tryna' get some hype
Bitch, you could be in rat hole, but they call me...

[Hook]
F.L.I.P. man these lame ass niggas
Ain't fuckin' with me
F.L.I.P. these niggas mad cause
My crib cost three point three
F.L.I.P. I'm the freestyle king of the SUC
F.L.I.P. I got niggas in every state
Reppin' Clover G

[Verse 2]

Yo, this nigga Clifford think he a don like me
You ain't dodge five shots, and take one like me
You ain't do screwed tapes, you just a rapping, nigga
Look, you a gold artist, I'm a platinum, nigga
3 PDOs retired, nigga I ain't falling off
Niggas need to come together
To represent the south
Cause there's too much money
To be made to be beefin'
Cause I just made a hundred grand this weekend
I made jobs for my niggas worth to fuck
I got my nigga 380, drivin' all my trucks
And he'd lay a nigga down
If I gave him the word
I'm always in first place, I can never be third
I moved birds in high school
Y'all niggas just doin' it
And that's all you rap about
Y'all just ruined it
I got niggas on the block
Tryna' get paid
You [?] out the pump
You can know that they call me...

[Hook]
F.L.I.P. man these lame ass niggas
Ain't fuckin' with me
F.L.I.P. these niggas mad cause
My crib cost three point three
F.L.I.P. I'm the freestyle king of the SUC
F.L.I.P. I got niggas in every state
Reppin' Clover G

[Outro: Funkmaster Flex]
That's right y'all!
