[Verse 1 - Lil' Flip]
Look I just bought a pint for one hundred in Cali
So I bought five thousand and then I sold e'm in Dallas
Now I'm back in H - Town drinkin'lean at school
I'm a sharp shooter I don't need a beam to shoot
I still think about Screw, everytime I spitt
My chain spinnin'plus it say Screwed Up Click
D-Wreck hit me and said I need a verse for Moe
I said 'fuck that I'm a do two for you bro'
He cut the check with much respect - so I wrote my verse
If I buy the pint, you know I gotta po'up first
I gotta blue cream soda now I'm ready to rap
I got my B-C-D check so now I'm ready to trap
I got my name on my bottle as I swang in my Tahoe
Look at a nigga jewels, you can tell if he got dough
It's Flip Gates, the number one Fly Boy
Big Hawk and Pimp C I hate ya'll bad to die

[Verse 2 - Big Moe]
I'm a take a gallon to the whole head - Like Maan
Sippin'potent ass drank, I ain't scared - Like Maan
Man these hatin ass niggas they be dead - Like Maan
Moe comin down drank I done spread - Like Maan
Comin down be for my Texas - hoes squash plexin'
Forein car Lexus, Maan you know you wrecked it
It's that Motorola, southside money folder
Man I told you befo'the AK, I'm down to hold
It's the grain, mayne million dollar stain
Hittin the boulevard Mo - Yo gon'spread lanes
I can spead drank, nigga speakin of the barre
I'm rollin foreign car - with drank in my jelly jar

[Chorus - Big Moe]
I done, I done hit the pint to the head - Like Maan
Comin'down gotta potent ass purple Sprite - Maan
I done, I done hit the pint to the head - Like Maan
Comin'down gotta potent ass purple Sprite - Maan

[Verse 3 - A-3]
Ca - Ca - Ca - boom, bounce - shake the flo'
Money, money, money - baby make some mo'
They say commercialize the rap, that's what it take to blow
I'm in the gutta dodgin traps, I'll never sell my soul
I'm a, I'm a take a pint to the head - Like Maan
Bendin corners, leanin'hard - runnin red lights - Maan
Right out the bakery, I had to get my bread right - Maan
You know my bread got that Ben Frank head right - Maan
Head lights with some different criss cross in the slab
Eighty - fo's cut ankles, get up off of the ave
Imitators tryna sound like the southside
You know we go with the swagga, leave they mouth wide - Maan
Talkin bout A-3, you heard of me
Lyrics like open heart surgery, can't you see
G is my pedigree, Heaven please bless the G's
This one for M-O-E, bust open a P-I-N-T to ya H-E-A-D

[Chorus - Big Moe]
I done, I done hit the pint to the head - Like Maan
Comin'down gotta potent ass purple Sprite - Maan

Comin'down gotta potent ass purple Sprite - Maan

[Verse 4 - Mike D]
You can call it the G Mix, better yet the remix
I do it for the hood, so let's call it the three mix
Boss Hogg Corleone back in the do'
With a pint of that purple and a sack of that dro
I ain't never been scared to put a duece in a Big Red
Take it straight to the head - Like Maan
Crawl fo's, crawlin like a spider, muddy cup up in my hand
Hundred large up nigga I'm the Maan
True religion this, Ed Hardy that
It's Mike D shinin'like the star on my hat
You can catch me off in Neiman Marcus cause I like to rock Prada
I leave the mall, hit the block with that white powder
Hopped out the seven - fifty, the year was up
Backdoed in the five - fifty, Coupe'n e'm up
And I just might blow the brains off my shhh
So you can see me bodyrockin off up in my shhh

[Chorus - Big Moe]
I done, I done hit the pint to the head - Like Maan
Comin'down gotta potent ass purple Sprite - Maan
I done, I done hit the pint to the head - Like Maan
Comin'down gotta potent ass purple Sprite - Maan
