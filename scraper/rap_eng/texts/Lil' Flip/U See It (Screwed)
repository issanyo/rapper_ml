(Lil' Flip talking)
Duke E Loud, Lil' Flip, you see what we doing
You see what we driving, you see how we living
You see the rims spinning, you see the platinum grill
Still man in it, uh uh

(Lil' Flip)
I pulled up in the jag (u see it)
Everybody know I got Texas cash (u see it)
I'm like Juve throwing up a soldier rag (u see it)
In H-Town I throw up a Clover flag (u see it)
On T.V. I'm still leaning to the left (u see it)
Got a deal but I didn't sign with Def (u see it)
Got a deal with Sony now we richer (u see it)
Look me up I'm in The Source see my picture (u see it)
I got hoes just coming to my shows (u see it)

You se everything we smoke is endo (u see it)
It's a truck but it's made by Benzo (u see it)

Some niggas claim red, some claim blue (u see it)

(Chorus)
Nothing less than 20 thousand on my wrist (u see it)
You got cars in your yard but none like this (u see it)
Candy frame, I'ma swing on twenty inch (u see it)
I ain't got to tell these hoes that I'm a pimp (u see it)
Be banging the Jaguar behind the ten (u see it)

Got my heater under my Iceberg fit (u see it)

(Lil' Flip)
You got a Cardier but it's little (u see it)
Look at mine I got X's in the middle (u see it)
I go to sleep on a Iceberg bed (u see it)
I'm feeling smart cause I always get head (u see it)
I might ride candy red, or black (u see it)
If it's called a Escalade it's a Lac (u see it)
If you sitting on twenties then they shine (u see it)
If it ain't endo, we call it pine (u see it)
Down here everybody got gold (u see it)
Still flipping cause we all got hoes (u see it)
Still rich cause we all got shows (u see it)
Couple of friends but we all got foes (u see it)

Platinum versus, platinum teeth and platinum chains
