This song right here, this what Steve Harvey say
He like off the album I Shoulda Listened
Shouts out to my nigga Steve Harvey (yeah)
My nigga Cool Cat, you know this just the underground shit
Freestyles man (freestyles), off my own beats
Check me out look

[Lil' Flip]
I shoulda listened, when you said don't do
A lot of shit, that people just don't do (my bad)
Move that dope (what), sell that crack (what)
Just to get money, and drive a Cadillac
I shoulda listened, when you told me
That, bullshit is what they sold me
Cause, they say black people ignorant
But I don't think that, I didn't listen
I'm in a bigger position, I paid my dues
I keep God first, cause that's the rules
I'm a changed man, the same man
I'm Lil' Flip, I stick to the game plan
Execute every move, watch out for every hater
Fuck getting blown, nigga I'm about my paper
After my paper blown, then I'ma get blown
But if I ain't got no paper, ain't no reason to blow
I do the show, and I make my stacks
A lot of niggas, don't know these tracks
Go everywhere, even overseas
That's why, I got some Range Rover keys
Cause I keep, going platinum in the streets
And I keep going platinum on these, beats
And some rappers, ain't even on they feet
But they doing thirty shows, all week
And I'm at my peak, I'ma be the best
Represent for the South, like Pac did the West
I'ma rep, for my niggas who in jail
I'ma rep, for niggas who making crack sales
I'ma rep, for my niggas in the motherfucking Penn
Trying to get out, just got ten
I'ma rep, for the niggas with no do'
I'ma rep, for the pimps who be really pimping hoes
Pimpin Ken, can't forget the Don Juan
I'm Lil' Flip, what's up to my nigga Ron
Lil' Ron nigga, that's my dog nigga
You got some beef, all you gotta do is call nigga
You know we coming, me and Hump we gunning
Watching out for these hoes, that I fucked when I was in Hundred
Middle School, I was just a little fool
I did a lot of shit, I got shot and was in critical
Condition, but I was still on a mission
It's like tracks, it's just like I'm fishing
I write a hook, and I hope somebody bank
I might go platinum, if it's music that they like
I'm so tight, cause I'm better now
I'm getting cheddar now, I'ma do a double header now
I'ma sell a lot of records, I'ma tell the people
I'm Lil' Flip, and I'm so so special

(*talking*)
Yeah (yeah), ha-ha I shoulda listened man
I shoulda listened, and that's what I'm saying man
Reality, this a reality check for y'all
Yeah, I shoulda listened, yeah I shoulda listened
Uh I shoulda listened, yeah kids, I shoulda listened
Keep God first
