*Lil Flip Talkin*

(Verse 1:Lil' Flip)
I'ma lane switcha,I'ma young game spitta why you lookin
At my rims cause mine can't bigga but I ain't jigga I'm Lil' Flip
You know me baggets and precious cutts
All in my rolie I dont shop a police cause I'm top
Of the line did you see how I made my bentley drop to the
Ground,I'ma codiene dranker thats all I sip
And 2000 cars thats all I flip
If it ain't on chrome I can't sit in it
If it ain't a big body I can't fit in it
Down south we all about are money
Down south we get are piece made by johnny
Down south we like to swang on glass
If you wanna sixteen you better bring my cash
I'm a millionare for real and now you know
My bank account say 10000

(T.C.)
I'ma playa on 20's rider
U.P.T resider bently off the show room
First class driver everything I own gotta be paid out
I bought a mansion in spain
Next to bill gates house
I love money large ammounts
I never wrote a check the bank bounced
Wodey I'm use to livin lavish
I gotta rolie on my wrist about forty karets
I like to cruise so I bought me a yat
I like baby's house so I bought the whole block
Wodey can't you see I get my shine on
I done moved my colisium into the super dome ya heard me

(Chorus: Big T.)
Why Ya'll Haters so Mad?
I don't know why baby
Hummers and Jags
Why Ya'll Hatin the way ya'll do?
Why Ya'll Haters so Mad?
I don't know why baby
Hummers and Jags
Cause we in Hummers and Jag

(Derrick)
I bought a Jag off the show floe
Wit no miles paid it out I can't stand notes
Wrote a check for 70 grand my shit paid for
My money legel I ain't worried bout the feds brah
18 set for life dogg I'm livin gravy
Girl thats big enough for me and you ain't it baby
I got some shit around my wrist
That do nothin but sparkle
My clothes and my mansion they madeamara
So much Ice in my pinkey ring tellins horror
All my arms tattooed nigga C.M.R
Moved mom's out the hood to washatona
She needed transportation so I bought a rover
She couldn't drive so I hired a mazada shofir
Tommorow night i'm goin to dinner wit your girl
Oprah,Oprah hoes see me in the club
Be like that boy rich
I don't take bathes in water moette and cris
I got some shit around my wrist
That a blind the day
How many niggas you know sleepin in versachi beds
Man that platinum 20 thousand dollars spreads
My nigga sold a trans am that was special made

(Chorus)

(Lil'Flip & T.C)
(T.C)
We gon ball wit shunny pooh for the millinuem
We 18 live in condominum
(Lil'Flip)
We ride on blades we ride on glass
And we got t.v's inside our jags
(T.C)
We in private jets we never on land
We ballin outta control ya understand
(Lil'Flip)
I stay in cloverland thats all I know
And big head dollars thats all I hold
(T.C)
Big body on brauders thats all I know
20 inch rims is all I roll
(Lil'Flip)
And my watch too cold
You know we actin bad shunny pooh
Now I see why them haters mad

(Chorus)
