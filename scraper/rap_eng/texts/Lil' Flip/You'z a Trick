Woah, Woah, Woah (You'z A Trick)
Woah, Woah, Woah Here we go!

[Chorus: repeat 4X]
Don't spend no money I'm a pimp - I'm a pimp
Why you keep spendin money - you'ze a trick
You'z a trick (You'z a trick)

[Lil' Flip]
Aye once again I'm back with the flow to make all ya'll haters mad
I'm at the club every night but I ain't trickin cash
Poppin bottles, fuckin models you know we do it big
Clip with hollows if you follow me I'm a split ya wig
We thirty deep at the club we all iced out
Clover G's party until they cut the lights off
Drinkin, smokin, chillin you know we get it crunk boy
VVS's in my ear this how you stunt boy
On the East they roll dutches-we smokin blunts boy
When we get in town look at the line in the front boy
Now listen ma you know you rollin with a G right
And half of my crew already got three stripes
Ya'll gettin three mics-I'm gettin four and better
That nigga wanna fuck you I just want yo'cheddar
I'm on another level, take a look at my bezzel
If yo'baby daddy wanna fight-tell him it's whatever

[Chorus]

[Lil' Flip]
Aye I got my cash up, my top down-these hoes think I'm hot now
Grippin grain, diamond chain five karat rocks now
Don't nobody get it poppin like my crew do it
If the music too fast homey I'm a Screw it
24's on H2's drop top, candy blue
Ya friend wanna leave with me, but shit I'm tryna leave with you
I can show you off my game, pimpin ain't gon'never change
Get my money in arrange you might get a Clover chain
I be drivin state to state pimpin hoes, makin cake
Clover G's collared shirt, tennis shoes baby they (woooh)
I do drive but half of the time I'm too high
Alligator air force ones girl I'm too fly (wooooh)
Cause I'm caked up-my wrist Jac'd up
I don't know why these niggas hate us
But I'm a stay paid and chop on blades
Cause everytime you trick my money get made (yeah)

[Chorus]

("You'z a trick" repeated until the end)
