[Lil' Flip talkin']
Ha ha, this tha realest shit I wrote
Ya'll say we look like kids
Oh ya'll don't think I heard what ya'll said
You puttin' it on tape, this for my dogz, nigga

[Chorus]
I'll ride for my dogz, I'll lie for my dogz
If it come down to it, I'll die for my dogz
I'ma thug with my dogz, I got love for my dogz
What I'm really tryin' to say, don't fuck with my dogz

[Lil' Flip]
Grab yo AK's, pumps and even Calicos
I fight for my dogz like we at the Alamo
If you run up on me, I'ma have to tear yo' clothes
So give me what you got, yo' rings and valuables
And if you fuck wit my dogz I'ma blow you away
And chop you up like ham and throw you away
I ain't never been no hoe, so stop bumpin' yo' gums
Oh you can't talk shit, when you got a pump on yo' tongue

[Scoopastar]
I cop bricks, in tha six, watchin' flicks wit my dogz
Cause flippin' 2 for 36 and hit licks wit my dogz
Cop Glocks, rock blocks, investin' stocks wit my dogz
Sit on docks, boardin' yachts, wit my big shots dogz
I'll take over ya cut wit my SuckaFree dogz
And I'll chop a busta up for APT dogz
I get brains, run trains and switch positions wit my dogz
Grip grain and swang lanes in Expeditions wit my dogz

[Will-lean]
I ride wit my dogz, I drank and get high wit my dogz
You betta run and try to hide when I collide wit my dogz
I bust AK's, aortas and 45's wit my dogz
Just make you slip, slide and fall and get tied like a hog
I break banks wit my dogz, I make stakcs wit my dogz
We rip a nigga ass up, like this track wit my dogz
I floss baggetts, princess cuts and Lexus trucks wit my dogz
And if you wanna live and raise yo kids, don't fuck wit my dogz

[B.G. Duke]
Gettin' fucked wit my dogz, I'ma make 'em call tha laws
My baggetts is shinin' and eat you up like Jaws
I'm beatin' through, black crew with wrist roo
C-note wit tha guns and Flip you get the loot
And when I shoot, I shoot to execute
Me, Taz and Scoop, hittin' licks in tha booth
That's what I do, in a bulletproof coupe
If you ain't my dog, then nigga fuck you

[Chorus]

[Lil' Flip]
Hey, hey, hey..When it come to my dogz, I'll spit on yo' face
And you bet not get caught, wit yo' shit on yo' waist
Cause if I catch you off base, I'm mamin' and choppin'
You might as well give up now, cause when I'm swangin', you droppin'
Nigga get outta line, I'm hurtin' 'em all
I caught fake niggas rough, cause when I'm swervin', they fall
I'm makin' CEO money, while you work in tha mall
And if you know about Flip, then you heard of my dogz
There he go, that nigga right there, he's a hoe
And I'm leave his white T-shirt wit a hole
I'll put him in a finger fold, don't fuck wit Flipper, hoe
I'm a kiss you wit a bullet, under a mistletoe

[Taz]
Cockin' back, point him out, watch I'll bust this nigga
Lay 'em tote, 100 shot, we couldn't trust this nigga
Infrared, touch his head, you couldn't duck this nigga
Call tha coroner, chalk him out, cause we done fucked this nigga

[Lil' Flip]
Hey, and we stuck that nigga, like a chicken, plucked that nigga
Finger fucked that nigga, like shit we flushed that nigga

[Taz]
Like a diamond, we crushed that nigga, bust that nigga
And ride wit Lil' Flip, cleanin' up on niggas
Droppin' bullets like rain, wettin' up yo niggas
Fuck you and everythang you love, hoe nigga

[Lil' Flip]
In conclusion, I'll empty out a full clip
You ain't known for trampolines, but you gon do a full flip
And whatever you said, I'ma make you take it back
And if you chest get got, nigga I'ma make it flat
So you betta watch out before we run in yo house
And tie you up like tennis shoes, and put a gun in yo' mouth

[Chorus]

[Lil' Flip talkin']
For my dogz nigga, ya'll wonder why ya'll don't see me, cause I only chill
Wit real niggas, nigga scoopastar, the original star, nigga Taz, Will-lean
Tha chemist, B.G. Duke, Humpty Hump, Les, Snoop, my real niggas, we don't
Fuck wit fraud niggas, Shasta, nigga Myron, fuck wit real niggas, you wonder
Why Lil' Flip don't be givin' you dap or speakin' to you nigga, nigga you
Ain't real, nigga, nigga I'll ride for my dogz....On my arm, nigga
