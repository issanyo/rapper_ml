Whoa, whoa, haha
This what I want you to do
I want you to go to the bar, go to the bar
And find the most expensive drink
Po' it on the nigga you don't like, haha, whoo, whoo
Yeah, yeah, we ain't come here to rock the crowd nigga
We came here to start a fuckin' fight, bitch
You know how we do it, uh, uh, Clover G's, uh oh

We came to get it crunk, we came to get drunk
We came to chill in VIP and smoke a couple of blunts
And pull a couple of dimes, spit a couple of rhymes
And them niggas young, fly, got a couple of knives
I'm ahead of my time cause I stay on my grind
Cause most niggas be lettin' hoes play with their mind
But not me, cause homey don't play that
You see me with a strap on me, go spray that
Shit where your face at, you talk and I take that
You talkin' out the side of your neck, don't make me break that
Slap you, slap him, clap you, clap him
Cause I ain't got time for all that wrestlin'
I'm just a cool dude when I'm in a good mood
But when I'm pissed off my attitude is 'fuck you'
I'm like a tattoo, I never go away
That's why I ride with a tec and a throwaway

All my niggas and my bitches
Throw your hood in the motherfuckin' air, throw it up
And if y'all get money like we get money
Let me hear y'all scream 'oh yeah'
All my niggas and my bitches
Throw your hood in the motherfuckin' air, throw it up
And if y'all smoke wee like we smoke weed
Let me hear y'all scream 'oh yeah'

Throw your hood up nigga, and tear the club up
While I'm in the parking lot tryna tear my dubs up
I'm cadillac pimpin' like the YoungBloodz
So come to Texas and smoke the best bud, nigga
I got what you want, I got what you need
And can't nobody throw a party like me
So, quit your frontin' and quit your cappin'
See that's why you ? cats never flip to platinum

All my niggas and my bitches
Throw your hood in the motherfuckin' air, throw it up
And if y'all get money like we get money
Let me hear y'all scream 'oh yeah'
All my niggas and my bitches
Throw your hood in the motherfuckin' air, throw it up
And if y'all smoke wee like we smoke weed
Let me hear y'all scream 'oh yeah'

All my niggas and my bitches
Throw your hood in the motherfuckin' air, throw it up
And if y'all get money like we get money
Let me hear y'all scream 'oh yeah'
All my niggas and my bitches
Throw your hood in the motherfuckin' air, throw it up
And if y'all smoke wee like we smoke weed
Let me hear y'all scream 'oh yeah', oh yeah
