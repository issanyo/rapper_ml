[Talking - Flip]
Reporting live from the mothafuckin hood
It's a whole bunch of rappers takin over the rap game
Lil' Flip and Young Noble we don't give a fuck about 'em
What do you have to say...fuck 'em all

(Chorus - Flip)
These rap niggas get a deal then they lose they mind
And once they money come in, that's when they lose they grind
Oooh I can't let it happen, Oooh I won't let it happen
Oooh I can't let it happen, y'all niggas shouldn't be rappin

[Bridge]
So who the boss, who the boss - you the boss Flip
So who the king, who the king - you the king Flip
So who the G, who the G - you the G Flip
You know we thuggin till infinity, ain't no label pimpin me

[Verse 1 - Flip]
Look I'm the king muh'fucka we go whole court
I be fightin I like full contact sports
See you a bitch so keep my name up out ya mouth
Cause I got ya address I'll show up to ya house
Knock, knock bitch nigga but this ain't a joke
Glock cocked bitch nigga cause I gotta Scope
Infrared to ya head leave you dead nigga
I tryed to tell you don't do business with the Feds nigga
I be hustlin, grindin cause I need mine
You got a family - bitch I gotta feed mine
When I came up in the game, I thought everybody was my friend
Till I got the brand new Benz, till I started stackin ends
You read the Du'pont, lookin at our homes
Look I done moved more weight then Star Jones
Pick it up, drop it off then I get my paper
I'm fly I got the mind of J and Tony Draper

(Chorus - Flip Repeat 2x)
These rap niggas get a deal then they lose they mind
And once they money come in, that's when they lose they grind
Oooh I can't let it happen, Oooh I won't let it happen
Oooh I can't let it happen, y'all niggas shouldn't be rappin

[Verse 2 - Young Noble]
It's odds and evens, I'm happy I'm alive and breathin'
They captivatin on the methods of my rhyme and reason
Time is tickin, the Outlaw's alive and kickin
Die for the mission, you know we keep the pots in the kitchen
Homie I'm cookin up that good crack, the hood gon'come back
They want that, so I pump that - for niggas can bump that
Real reconize real, I ain't gotta say I is
Ask the old heads, you can even ask the little kids
Bet they tell you this nigga respect them boys
We been thru it, you couldn't tell me nothin at all
One love, one thug - Real Talk Entertainment
Show you how to lay a hater, face down on the pavement
Show you how to put in work, turn somethin out of nathan(nothin)
The harder they tryna stop us, the harder we tryna make it
One love, one thug - Real Talk Entertainment
The harder they tryna stop us, the harder we tryna make it - nigga

(Chorus - Flip Repeat 2x)
These rap niggas get a deal then they lose they mind
And once they money come in, that's when they lose they grind
Oooh I can't let it happen, Oooh I won't let it happen
Oooh I can't let it happen, y'all niggas shouldn't be rappin

[Verse 3 - Flip]
Ay I told Sac just hit me when you need me back
You come to Houston I got you nigga with the Mac
You want the Mac - Ten, Mac - Eleven, Mac - Ninety
Just hit the mothafuckin line nigga you'll find me
See I be in the crib tryna come up with a plan
Tryna make a million, tryna get me a hundred grand
I got the old Fifty, I jam the old Fifty
I like the new Fifty, I'm doin two - fifty
I'm in the fast car, movin like a Nascar
Spittin to a bad broad - y'all niggas front hard
I'm in the fast car, movin like a Nascar
Spittin to a bad broad - y'all niggas front hard

(Chorus Till End)
