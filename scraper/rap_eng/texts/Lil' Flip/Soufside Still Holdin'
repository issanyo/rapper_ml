Chorus:
Souf side still holdin and it ain't no lie
We ride on 4 wit tv's inside
We all suckafree, got the game sewed
When we put the mic down, say man hold up
(repeat)

Verse:
Souf side still holdin im in a expedition
With a sign on the back that say lets go fishin
Im Lil Flip, the freestyle king u know me
Baggats and trillion cuts all in my rolie
I just went to the car lot and bought a limo
I got 7 dvd's and im watchin RamBo
When i hit the club i ain't starrin at hoes
I know one thang they bet not step on my Horvana Jobe's
I got Gucci shoes, i got Gucci shades
Lil Flip pull stunts like Super Dave
I keep ballin, keep crawlin, keep prawlin
People wanna know where im at keep callin
Cuz im a baller im always top of the line
2000 Bentley watch it squat to the grind
Poppin bottles of wine, Moet and crystyle
On the souf side i keep my hand on my pistyle
Cuz people be always tryna show off
They try to jack but i won't take my 4's off
I know.. i gotta shine, get rotation on 97.9
U might see my car redder than the nose of Rudolph
Freestyle 10 minutes at Screw House
The freestyle king i always go hard
After concerts i might pull yo braud

( repeat chrous til fade)
