Yeah, they told me I had to prove myself I'm like Eminem I'ma

CB on the shelf, I'ma be paid nigga, live laid nigga, I been rappin
Ever since the third grade nigga, I keep the game from head to D
To the B R A T Jamaican free, I used to wanna rap but I
Couldn't buy beats, I never been the trick but I got treats
Lil' Flippa I had to shine, graduated in 1999

Be a quita, I can't fuck all night, I gotta live with my dream
I had a dream to be the Freestyle King
And I am I am and you niggas still hatin, and you niggas broke
Sittin' on the cratin, waitin, wanna do a track with me, nigga

And a house nigga, did take care of mama when you got paid
Did you fuck with a bitch and go get laid, when got my money nigga
I went to see my motherfuckin niggas who was in the penadentry
With no money nigga, with no hoes, with no clothes, some niggas
In night in parole but, I'm still cold on the motherfuckin mic nigga
I'm so throwed I can fuck a dike nigga
I been freestylin nigga all my life nigga, I'm doin this shit from the head
I ain't white nigga, niggas hate me, but I don't really care
Cause I'ma be a legend like Andre Wettah, you can't fuck wit me
You might as well jump down cause I'm the hardest freestyler around
Man, Lil' Ron we havin a little fun, we packing big bullets and we got
Those little guns, nigga, we don't play with you niggas, that's why
We won't spend a motherfuckin day with you niggas, you niggas
Talkin, hatin and chit chat, nigga we the fuckin sucka free nigga
On the map, and I did like that, my nigga, in this rap game
Committed like that, I can spit it like that, what my fitted like that
When you I can do dat nigga I did it like that, there was a reason
I'm ballin every season, nigga I'm young dirty ass hevened, but I
Found my way up part the ghetto, you tried to take what I work
Before I got the ghetto, and I don't play wit you niggas, fuck you
