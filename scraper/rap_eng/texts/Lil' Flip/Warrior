(*Talking*)
Ay I'm tired of all this talkin
I don't know what y'all heard
But I'm a warrior, let's go

[Chorus]
Real niggas (what up?) Clover Geez (What up?)
If you ain't talkin 'bout fightin then you need to (shut up!)
I'm a warrior nigga, I ain't scared of you nigga
I'm a gangsta boy, I'll put led in you nigga

[Verse 1]
If you diss Lil' Flip I'ma find you nigga
If you forgot I'ma G I'ma remind you nigga
I got pimps on my team that'll cut you up
Man, I got pimps on my team that'll fuck you up
I ain't never been a hoe, I never run from a fight
I'm the one the hoes love but the niggas don't like
Cause I made it out the hood now my team doin great
Niggas finally get a brick now they think they got weight
Nigga, I been straight you the one goin broke
I got 300 grand around my throat
Cause I'm the hardest MC reppin H-Town
You keep playin I'ma leave you with your face down

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
Huh, niggas know me I ain't scared of a bitch nigga
Cause you know a roach ain't shit to a rich nigga
And just because you heard I rap you don't know a nigga
Now gimme that, that ain't the right way to hold a pistol (stupid)
You toy soldiers gon catch five and roll over
While me and the other Clover Geez blow doja
And if you bitch made
I'ma run across your face with a switch blade, now take that

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
I be in Memphis 10, I be with Juice and Paul
I get money from Skinny Pimp (why?) cause that's my dog
I be with killers and convicts that put in work
I can blow five mil' and it will not hurt (damn!)
Cause I learn the game before I earn my change
And I will pay you back if you mention my name
Huh, it could be the mailman at your front do'
Or it could be your biggest fan in the front row
I like drama so call your momma I got a llama
That's what you get bitch for fuckin with a big tymer
A rich nigga with chrome triggers for all y'all
And if it's fuck me, you know it's fuck y'all

[Chorus] - 4x
