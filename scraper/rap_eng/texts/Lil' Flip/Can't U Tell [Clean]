Aye, I know a lot of y'all, n***, wonderin'
Is this n*** doin' good? Yes, Is this n*** really ridin' spinners? Yes
I tell them n***, man, can't U tell a n*** doin' good, man?
Can't U tell? Lil' Flip is in the building
We got DJ Squeeky on the track, Clover G's
We throw bows, we blow d***
We ride blades and low pro's
Um, I heard you doin' good, n***, can't U tell?
Oh, you still in the hood 'cause you ain't doin' too well
We throw bows, we blow d***
We ride blades and low pro's
Um, I heard you doin' good, n***, can't U tell?
Oh, you still in the hood 'cause you ain't doin' too well
Clover G's, Now when I pull up in my drop, one switch make it rock
One switch make it hop, the other switch make it stop
I got wood grain on my dash, paper out the a***
I don't ride around with wallets, I carry paper bags
Ride around with t***, endo with a vest
Giovanni's on my Hummer and spinners on my Lex
I rep Houston, Tex where n*** b***, s***
We ride candy paint, n***, what about your crew?
Got a piece and a chain, a watch and a ring
Ten thousand square foot home plus a spot for my plane
I spit game to h*** to get 'em out their clothes
'Cause that's how it go when all ya jewelry froze
I been pimpin' for a while, I'm a hot boy like Nile
My jacket is mink but my shoes are Crocodile
I'm thuggin' forever fifty karats in my bezel
But I'm like Trillville 'cause y'all can't get on my level
We throw bows, we blow d***
We ride blades and low pro's
Um, I heard you doin' good, n***, can't U tell?
Oh, you still in the hood 'cause you ain't doin' too well
We throw bows, we blow d***
We ride blades and low pro's
Um, I heard you doin' good, n***, can't U tell?
Oh, you still in the hood 'cause you ain't doin' too well
Uh, I'm in the club b***, f*** it, I'm a throw some bows
Hit the bar and get bent and go and f*** some h***
I'm this b*** actin' wild, you know how Gudda do it
I got my p*** on my hip in case I get into it
N*** drinkin' that incredible hulk
Now he drunk and he think he the Incredible Hulk
Uh, they gon' have to drag him out this b***
Then the police gon' come and drag me out this b***
It's Gudda, I'm doin' good and it feels great
I'm in the hood, H2 and it's charcoal gray
Supa dup' fly boy, supa dup' frisby
Give a f*** about the name, just know he gets busy
Mouth for the south, you know ya know me well
Hollow shells swell you like a macaroni shell
F*** you, haters, the chains is off
Clover, chains is on, we off the chains, lil' boy, yeah
We throw bows, we blow d***
We ride blades and low pro's
Um, I heard you doin' good, n***, can't U tell?

Yeah, uh, yeah, come on, MJG, pimp tight, Lil' Flip got a hit on the chart
But if a girl wanna get on the chart, s***, I'll still put a b*** on the block
You don't really want that really, now tell the truth, slow ya role
You got the cars and clothes but you still don't know ya h***
I'm a h***, I dissect the b*** and find the problem
I got solutions for a problem, I'm here to resolve 'em
Pull up in a 1969 Impala, whites over blacks, they harder
Everyday I wake up early tryna' make a dollar
I think I wanna pop my collar
Could it be I'm just a natural born with a little dose of pimpin'
Ooh, nothin' but motionless women strap up, put this life up in 'em
I don't pretend, I mean exactly what I mean
I don't sell those you can go to sleep and have a dream
When I roll through the dirty south sittin' up on my twenty-fo's
Breakin' me a ciggarillo down, fillin' it up with nothin' but d***
M J f*** G, representer of the dirty
But I spit it hard enough to make sure that the world heard me
We throw bows, we blow d***
We ride blades and low pro's
Um, I heard you doin' good, n***, can't U tell?
Oh, you still in the hood 'cause you ain't doin' too well
We throw bows, we blow d***
We ride blades and low pro's
Um, I heard you doin' good, n***, can't U tell?
Oh, you still in the hood 'cause you ain't doin' too well
