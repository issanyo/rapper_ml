[Intro:]
Your next brother coming up, man
This is my homie, we go way back
You know, I call him like you know Wyclef's a little brother besides of their concern
And first time I heard of this dude, man
I thought he wanted my job, man
You know what I mean?
Shit out of Montreal, man
I'm glad to see other Haitians coming up
This kid rhyme, he sings, he produce
Well my man 13, he go by the name of Imposs
He's really my lil brother right here!
Get into it, man! This one called "Real City"!
Montreal is real, you know what I mean?
Believe that!
Let's get into it, Imposs

By now you should know that we're Haitians!
Migrate from Haiti, end up in Brooklyn, Canada, Miami
Atlanta, Boston, now we're all over the world!

[Bridge 1:]
How y'all doing? Sak pase
Comment ça va ce soir?
Yalready know Ou konnen
Tu sais déjà who we are
Yeah my lingo, trilingual, we came to raise the bar
Try to keep up with the bars, cause we’re about to go hard!

[Hook:]
About to go amazing
About to go amazing
Everywhere we go, man they're rocking with the Haitian
We're about to go amazing, about to go amazing
Everywhere we go, man they're rocking with the Haitian!

[Verse 1:]
Uh, eat 'em up, spit them out
They're all part of my food chain
Gotham, Bruce Wayne, running shit, man I'm Hussein
Move back, niggas you're saying
Don't get killed on that power trip
Niggas change and go Hollywood
And disappear like magic, Dwight Howard shit
Oh you thought we was ballin hah?
We're still up in them warm up suits
Getting texts to your girl
Sayin I think of you, horse's shoe
Horse power on a brand new car
Got them horses on the polo drawers
You would think that we're on the ran
So advanced, you know the protocol

[Bridge 2:]
I was sent by the preacher’s son
Montreal screaming, “he’s the one!”
Baby girl, I spent the day with him
We’re snapping pics like we Ye and Kim
Mind right cause my heart left
We’re rolling like a car theft
We want world peace like Artest
But not to kill the mother fuckers of a heart test

[Hook:]
About to go amazing
About to go amazing
Everywhere we go, man they're rocking with the Haitian
We're about to go amazing, about to go amazing
Everywhere we go, man they're rocking with the Haitian!

[Verse 2:]
"I paged you", says the boss who considers himself powerful
"But you didn't buy me", says the man
"You're just a coward dude!"
I'm on the dollar bill, I live where the owls go
Only when family is threatened, that's when I will pull
I got nothing to lose, that's a damn lie!
I see you people cry when your man's die, men's die!
And you ain't got no backup, you a stand by
And that ain't your shooter, that's your man's gun
And you ain't real, you're acting ya'll
You only shoot when the director says to go, go
And next to blow, that's my little bro
Imposs from a land where's extra cold!
Montreal, it get hot, everybody wanna be a zone desperado
I see Ralo big and hollow
In the belly of the beast, you can swallow

[Bridge:]
How y'all doing? Sak pase

[Hook:]
About to go amazing
About to go amazing
Everywhere we go, man they're rocking with the Haitian
We're about to go amazing, about to go amazing
Everywhere we go, man they're rocking with the Haitian!

[Verse 3:]
Yeah, ice-cream color chains, Ben and Jerry
Legendary like Clef and Jerry
Me and 13, that new Snoop and Dre
That Pete Rock and C yea, that new Drake and 40
From drinking 40's, to sippin spades at the 40-40
Yeah, I'm getting it now
Imagine what I'll be getting at 40
Life's a bitch, and she talking about you can't afford me
Prove her wrong, make her dance, and then go get your glory!
Make her strip on that pole, Babel tower
Then you'll get the naked truth at the final hour
Building for the future, living like there's no tomorrow
Closed session, got enough bottles to drown your sorrows
Fly above the forecast, Jacobs trickin that top glass
A couple girls getting orgasms
Cause I mastered the art craft
Actors sits like the car crashed
We're too much for you dummies, now!
If you want the beef with 13?                                                              Ask my brother Semi it's a hundred times

We're about to go amazing, about to go amazing

[Outro:]
Man, about to go amazing man
Where we go they rockin with them Haitians man
You know what I mean?
Ya'll know what it is man, I rep Haiti man
24-4, yalready know
Ya'll seen my flag at the Grammys before it was popular
I don't need to talk
Everyboby already know bout it, ya already know
Yo this ya boy Wyclef Jean
Lot of people like, yo why you talkin that country accent?
'Cus I got a lot of my family that went over to the south
So when I went down there, you know?
They installed the accent
