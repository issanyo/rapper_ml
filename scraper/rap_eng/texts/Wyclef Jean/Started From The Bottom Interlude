[Bridge:]
I love you in your fast car
With your hair blowing back and the smile of a star
Everybody know who you are
Singing every Drake song on the billboard chart
Thought I was going to November
But you saw me in December
Camp fire in Aruba
That's when we lit it up, started to blaze
Reminiscing on the old school days

[Hook 1:]
Started out in Haiti, now we here
Started out in Haiti, now the whole Sosa here
Started out in Haiti, now we here
Started out in Haiti, now the whole Sosa here
Started out in Haiti, now we here
Started out in Haiti, now the whole Sosa here
Started out in Haiti, now we here
Started out in Haiti, now the whole Sosa here

[Verse 1:]
How you deal with all the mad press? Tell me does it hurt
What you gonna tell em man I used to eat dirt?
Started in the bottom in a hut with no shirt
Now I'm living in a mansion, tell me what's worse
Couple bad investments, I'm a raise up my stock
Man I'm sitting with the Russians and talking on the yacht
They say Clef you wanna be the good prez
But you gonna be a better mogul music exec

[Hook 2:]
Cause you started from the bottom now you're here
Started from the bottom now the whole dudes are here
Started from the bottom now we here
Man we started from the bottom now the whole dudes are here

[Verse 2:]
The word on the street we turned at a general
The girls love it when I speak that creole
Saca faite, aki S who Vinnie lie
Who told Belvedere who got bizz with makiage
No te come and say, um baka, did you know me keep you up
No te come and say, um baka, did you know me keep you up
No te come and say, um baka, did you know me keep you up

Wyclef with that bilingual flow
Yeah been a long time yo, I shouldn't kept y'all
But I was too busy running for president y'all
Now that we got a president, I'm back on my grind y'all
Doin what I do best, turn up my keyboard
Deck got them beats when we back on the streets yo
Refugee Republic tryina sign em real acts yo
You play that guitar girl, you got a band
Send me a pic, on your Instagram

[Bridge:]
I love you in your fast car
With your hair blowing back and the smile of a star
Everybody know who you are
Singing every Drake song on the billboard chart
Thought I was going to November
But you saw me in December
Camp fire in Aruba
That's when we lit it up, started to blaze
Reminiscing on the old school days

[Hook 3:]
We started from the bottom, now we here
Started out in Haiti, now the whole clique in here
Started out in Haiti, now we here aye
Started out in Haiti, now the whole Sosa here

Aye, Clef aka Hip Hop Guitarist

[Guitar solo]
