(New millennium, pump this in your jeeps)
Yo this is for all y'all out there
That ever dealt with somebody
(Pump this in your jeeps)
Who be lying, faking
Cheating, stealing
Creeping, BS'ing
(Pump this in your jeeps)
I got this thing called the lie detector
Two teaspoons and they're bound to tell the truth
(Pump this in your jeeps)
Listen

[Mya]
You told me
That I was your fantasy yeah
You said that
We would practice monogamy
So I became a freak under the sheets
Put his ass to sleep
Creeped into the kitchen
Got the remedy
It's called the lie detector
I slipped it in his drink
Brought it to his bedside
And said take a sip of this and don't think

You won't believe what happened
When he sipped the lie detector
Looked into his eyes
Asked him where you been?
He said it's no surprise
Cause I've been with my ex girl
Why ain't you tell me the truth?
He said you don't wanna hear the truth

Sometime I wish I never gave him a detector
I thought he loved me but he loved her
So I'm kind of glad he took the lie detector
Now I know the truth so you can get the boot

[Beenie Man]
Man, God of to, God of to, God of to go
Come and tie up you, tie up you, tie up you tongue
Else, head ago, head ago, head ago roll
When she finds out you and her friend lie down

[Mya]
She told you baby let's get married
I'll always been faithful so let's spend eternity
So he became a freak under the sheets
Put her ass to sleep
Creep into the kitchen got the remedy
It's called the lie detector
Slipped it in her drink
Brought it to her bedside
And said take a sip of this and don't think

You won't believe what happened
When he gave her the lie detector
Looked at the pager number
And said who's called sixty-nine?
She said don't be surprise
Cause 69's your best friend
He looked and swallow his pride
Frontin' like tough guys don't cry

Sometimes he wish he never gave her a detector
Thought she loved him, but she loved his best friend
But now he's kind of glad she took the lie detector
He found out the truth so he gave her the boot

[Beenie Man]
Look at all the women in the country
It ain't my fault
If the girls them want to love me
True me make out of heat
Why the girls them want to look at me
True, me the girls them sugar
Them girls them want to taste me
Anyway, my life is sweet, my girl is neat
But out on the street the girls are dropping at my feet
Well my point of view the way I see it
Without defeat love your girl, don't cheat
From your lovin' girl is but a treat

[Mya](Beenie Man)
If you got any type of suspicion
(Baby it's all up to your expectations)
Make sure that it's real communication
(The love I have for you is stronger than the foundation)
Don't want to find yourself asking how did this happen
(My heart is closed, my love is not open)
Friday the thirteenth went to the movies
(Baby love me up and get grooving, grooving)
