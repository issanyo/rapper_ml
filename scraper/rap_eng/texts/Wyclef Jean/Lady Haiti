[Hook]
I’m in love with Lady Haiti
And when they called me to the Grammys
I wrapped her flag all around me
Cause I’m in love with Lady Haiti
I’m so in love they call me crazy
I left the music went to Haiti
Even though they tried to stop me

[Verse 1]
I’ve seen the earth shake right under her feet
She told me 'baby don’t weep'
I’m sitting on Oprah, tears in my eyes
I knew your story ever since a kid
Developed a crush when I heard what you did
1804 you made my people free
You the reason I feel I can be anything

[Bridge]
She in the white sand
Under the hot sun, eh
Love when she talking that Creole, eh
Gadé bèl fanm

[Hook]
I’m in love with Lady Haiti
And when they called me to the Grammys
I wrapped her flag all around me
Cause I’m in love with Lady Haiti
I’m so in love they call me crazy
I left the music went to Haiti
Even though they tried to stop me
I’m in love with lady Haiti
Miss Haiti
Miss Haiti

[Verse 2]
They tried to make you turn on me for real
Said I stole everything that we built
You told me don’t bother, the truth's in my eyes
From the bottom of the buck and straight to the top
Every time you around I can feel the clock stop
Despite what they think, we got a chance
Cause we got one last dance

[Bridge]
She in the white sand
Under the hot sun, eh
Love when she talking that Creole, eh
Gadé bèl fanm

[Hook]
I’m in love with Lady Haiti
And when they called me to the Grammys
I wrapped her flag all around me
Cause I’m in love with Lady Haiti
I’m so in love they call me crazy
I left the music went to Haiti
Even though they tried to stop me
I’m in love with lady Haiti
Miss Haiti
Miss Haiti

[Verse 3]
Sakapfèt, Sakapfèt, Sakapfèt
Sakapfèt chéri Ayiti map mandew
Sakapfèt
Leuw ou tombé gade jan ou lévé
Leuw ou lévé gadé jan ou
Pran fòs é leuw ou pran fòs pagen
Mounn kap kenbew Ou gen pouw
Dérapé avèk atakénn nou Pa Janm panike

[Outro]
I’m in love with Lady Haiti
Miss Haiti
I'm in love with Lady Haiti
Miss Haiti
Lady
Miss Haiti
