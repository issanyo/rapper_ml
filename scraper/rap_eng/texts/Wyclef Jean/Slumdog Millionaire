[** feat. Imposs:]
It seems like the only way you gon' hear me
Is when I throw the autotune on my voice
So rep yo city rep yo city
Rep yo city rep yo city!
Rep yo city rep yo city
Rep yo city rep yo city!

[Chorus]
I'm a young Haitian slumdog millionaire
I'm a young Haitian slumdog millionaire
Ain't nothing you gon' tell me that I can't hear
Go on tell me that my mama use to e on welfare
Sticks and stones may break my bones
But names could neva hurt me Mr. Hater Hater Hater
How does it feel when you u see me countin' paper paper?
Some don't like me cause I left the block
I can't be about 40 still on the block
Look at you bout 50 still on the block
Talkin' bout you got swag doin' same ol' gwap
When I was young it was you I watched
I said I wouldn't make the same mistakes I got off the block
You know the life of the refugee
In any second I can become a deportee
So when you talk about you got checks
Boy you must be in a club high off a x
Cause cash that we got it ain't even in the states
And the cars that we drop they got diplomatic plates
This ain't a rap song it's the truth
Google Wyclef Jean if you lookin for the proof
And if you want me to sign you you got to be tri langual
Ask IMPOSS he got the tri langual lingo

[Chorus:]
I'm a young Haitian slumdog millionaire
I'm a young Haitian slumdog millionaire
Ain't nothing you gon' tell me that I can't hear
Go on tell me that my mama use to e on welfare
Sticks and stones may break my bones
But names could neva hurt me Mr. Hater Hater Hater
How does it feel when you u see me countin' paper paper?
[IMPOSS:]
Came from dirt, now my polo shirt; not a rinkle
Y'all didn't know my lingo's tri langual
My single; achete li..., achete le...
Swo hot you can't cop ...UN... gotta cop ...deux...
All dem dudez from my block be screamin ... rouge et blue ...
And dem cops on the block be aimin ... ouvre les yeux...
[Wyclef Jean:]
Oh if you don't want anotha riot
Stop firin at the innocent Mr. Sergeant!
[IMPOSS:]
Yeah, hey time got hard but we had to push on
Girls who didn't like us now they call us Pouchon
Slow motion: now they wanna wine slow
All cause my flow's sick you could call it the swine flow
Box hataz, on my coner got Wyclef
I push your mind right cause I don't throw no weak left
Every hit is a knock out punch
Came from nothing now you see me pop out the brunch hen
Surpass everybody by a landslide
Fly first class now I'm up in N.Y
And I was sent by Wyclef
To be the champ I'm not by my self
I got all young Haitian slumdog millionaire

[Chorus]
I'm a young Haitian slumdog millionaire
I'm a young Haitian slumdog millionaire
Ain't nothing you gon' tell me that I can't hear
Go on tell me that my mama use to e on welfare
Sticks and stones may break my bones
But names could neva hurt me Mr. Hater Hater Hater
Rep yo city rep yo city
Rep yo city rep yo city!
Rep yo city rep yo city
Rep yo city rep yo city!
Lil Haiti we here Montreal, Brooklyn, Queens
Stand up now
I'm a young Haitian slumdog millionaire
I'm a young Haitian slumdog millionaire
Ain't nothing you gon' tell me that I can't hear
Go on tell me that my mama use to e on welfare
Sa Pase records
Haitian slumdog millionaire
If IMPOSS can do it.so can you
Wyclef Commander and chief
N'ale Jerry Wonda on the cooka
