Wyclef: Hello, boys and girls, welcome to Wyclef Words of Wisdom. I am here with an M.C. that everyone is scared of. He has killed over a million people on record and he's still not locked up. Am, what is your name sir?
Killer M.C.: Nuhmsayin? Am
Wyclef: Yeah. Basically, if you have killed so many people, why ain't you locked up?
Killer M.C.: I'm sayin' though like, nuhmsayin?
Wyclef: Yeah, exactly my point. Don't believe the hype (Sirkiller Michano Classic)
