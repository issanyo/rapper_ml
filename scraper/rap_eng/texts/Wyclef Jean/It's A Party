[Intro: Wyclef Jean]
Is it soft?
Is it soft? Is it soft?
Coco B, R&R
And Bounty Killer
Refugees Productions
Black John on the Sound
C'mon, let's Run

[Chorus: Nona (Wyclef Jean)]
It's a Party (Show Love)
Let's get together (C'mon down)
Make it happen (Let's make it happen, yo)
Feel much better (Feel this)
There'll be no shooting (Hold it down)
At each other (Hold it down)
It's a party (Why? Cause the Killer said so)

[Verse 1: Coco Brovaz]
In a smoke filled room
Banging my favorite tune
Play it loudly
Soldiers around me
Getting Rowdy
Cocoa B's and Bounty
We mash the Party
Then flee the county
Country to Country
Come see the natty from the refugee
All Star in the clup, pay the V.I.P
Show me love BCC in the double tree
Rap star at the bar, pour bottles of bubbly
We MCs rocking box like Run-DMC
Spread love with my peeps and my family
S-T double E, Smokey he run with me
Telll flowers cover me that's my PNC's and

[Chorus: Nona (Wyclef Jean)]
It's a Party (Show Love)
Let's get together (C'mon down)
Make it happen (Let's make it happen, yo)
Feel much better (Feel this)
There'll be no shooting (Hold it down)
At each other (Hold it down)
It's a party (Why? Cause the Killer said so)

[Verse 2: Bounty Killer]
Party going on from night 'til day
Full attention is what the ladies pay
Things weh we say, the girls dem obey
'Cause dem never yet party this way
Ladies, come over if you wanna play
I'll be at your service right away
All when me old and mi hair dem grey
Anyweh di party deh, me a deh deh

[Chorus: Nona (Wyclef Jean)]
It's a Party (Show Love)
Let's get together (C'mon down)
Make it happen (Let's make it happen, yo)
Feel much better (Feel this)
There'll be no shooting (Hold it down)
At each other (Hold it down)
It's a party (Why? Cause the Killer said so)

[Verse 3: Coco Brovaz (Bounty Killer)]
Baby, wanna dub with me
Get me answer to the club seasoned grub on me
Well, I'll be sippin' Hennessy up in the V.I.P
And I'm just trying to stay alive like a Refugee
Smoking black trees with Coco B's
Wave King Rock checker for a Walabees
And all my thugs with me
Get in the club for free
You gotta respect these
Ghetto celebrities
'Cause we party from Jamaica back to NYC

[Chorus: Nona (Wyclef Jean)]
It's a Party (Show Love)
Let's get together (C'mon down)
Make it happen (Let's make it happen, yo)
Feel much better (Feel this)
There'll be no shooting (Hold it down)
At each other (Hold it down)
It's a party (Why? Cause the Killer said so)

[Verse 3: Bounty Killer]
Well!
Step inna the party, girls a push and shove
Tell dem guy, "bye-bye", dem madly in love
And a approach me with kisses and hugs
Kiss off mi cheek 'til dem lipstick smudge
Wanna be a member of the fan club
Sketell a wink me, but me never budge
How much hot gyal me have a melt like fudge?
Addicted to this like it is hard drugs
Food man a toss 'cause dem filled with grudge
Why they wanna harm me and my Refugees thugs?
Just because the girls love the way we does
When we a chat dem nuff
Nuff

[Chorus: Nona (Wyclef Jean)]
It's a Party
Let's get together
Make it happen
Feel much better
There'll be no shooting
At each other
It's a party (Why? Cause the Killer said so)

[Outro: Nona]
It's a Party
Let's get together
Make it happen...
