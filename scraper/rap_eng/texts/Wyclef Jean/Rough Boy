[Verse 1]
What in the world has come over me?
Sometimes I feel like I lost my chance in society
Even though I rap, I'm runnin' outta line
But give me a minute to catch myself, girl
I'll be feelin' fine

[Verse 2]
I am the one who can fade the heat
The one they all say just can't be beat
I'll shoot it to you straight and look at you in the eye
Just give me a minute, girl, and I'ma tell you why

[Chorus]
I'm a rough boy, I'm a really, really rough boy
I was raised in a place where I had no choice but to be rough, boy
But tonight I'm gon' be gentle witchu, girl
Even though I'm a rough boy
Please show love to this rough boy

[Verse 3]
I don't care how they look at me
As long as, when you look, I'm the one you see
We can make it work, we can make it by (yeah)
Just give me a second, girl, and I'ma tell you why

[Chorus]
I'm a rough boy, I'm a really, really rough boy
I was raised in a place where I had no choice but to be
Rough boy
But tonight I'm gon' be gentle witchu, girl
Even though I'm a rough boy
Please show love--

[Interlude]
Baby, let the rude boy play guitar now
Baby, let your rough boy play guitar now

[Outro]
I'm a rough boy (I'm a rough boy)
I'm a really, really rough boy
I was raised in a place where I had no choice but to be rough, boy
But tonight I'm gon' be gentle witchu, girl
Even though I'm a rough boy
Please show love to this rough boy
Show love to this rough boy (rough boy)
Girl, baby, baby, show love to this rough boy
