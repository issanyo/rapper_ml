[Hook: Wyclef Jean] (Mavado)
Hold on, be strong, no matter what your goin through
You know it's 'gon be ok (OK!) today
Even if the Chiney K sprays

[Verse One: Wyclef Jean]
Like I said on BET from the hood to the projects to the mansion
So you got no excuse stop blamin the recession
Go hard, and if you a single mom raisin babies on your own
This one's for you play it as loud as you want
Every block, every school, dream initiation
So build the world make it a better place
Like Michael Jackson we don't wanna see another 9-11 happen
Wish I had talked to them teenagers when them RPG's go in
Head on with the navy seals I would've told them there's a better way

[Hook: Wyclef Jean] (Mavado)
Hold on, be strong, no matter what your goin through
You know it's 'gon be ok (OK!) today
Even if the Chiney K sprays
We gotta hold on, be strong
I know that you don't think that I can read your palms
But I see the dawn (The dawn) beyond (Beyond!)
Beyond I can see the sunlight
And if the raaaaaaaaiiiiiiiiiinnnnnnn!!!! falls down!!!!
It ain't nothin but a blessed day today
The suuuuuuuuunnnnnnn!!!!! will shiiiiiinnnnnnnnnineeee!!!!
After the rain dries!!!!!

[Verse Two: Mavado]
To all my thugs that's gone, memories live on
I guess, see you at the crossroad!!!!
So many cry when we die and they wonder if we're in the sky
See you at the crossroad!!!!
I see you in my dream, that night, that crime scene
But don't worry, see you at the crossroad!!!!
Remember we still a team and I know you can hear me now
See you at the crossroad!!!!

[Hook: Wyclef Jean] (Mavado)
Hold on, be strong, no matter what your goin through
You know it's 'gon be ok (OK!) today
Even if the Chiney K sprays
We gotta hold on, be strong
I know that you don't think that I can read your palms
But I see the dawn (The dawn) beyond (Beyond!)
Beyond I can see the sunlight
And if the raaaaaaaaiiiiiiiiiinnnnnnn!!!! falls down!!!!
It ain't nothin but a blessed day today
The suuuuuuuuunnnnnnn!!!!! will shiiiiiinnnnnnnnnineeee!!!!
After the rain dries!!!!!

[Bridge: Wyclef Jean]
(She wants to know) She wanna know how long I been playin
(As long as my mama) As long as my mama she been prayin
(She bought me a guitar) She bought me a guitar at eleven
She ain't want me be usin Mac 11's
(When I said) So when I said daddy was gone 'til November
(I knew) I knew that he wouldn't be back in November
Cause I could've been the one in the bank with a shank
With a pump and a ski mask
But my bank is the stage, my 12 gauge a black act

[Hook: Wyclef Jean] (Mavado)
Hold on, be strong, no matter what your goin through
You know it's 'gon be ok (OK!) today
Even when the earth quakes
We gotta hold on, be strong
I know that you don't think that I can read your palms
But I see the dawn (The dawn) beyond (Beyond!)
Beyond I can see the sunlight
And if the raaaaaaaaiiiiiiiiiinnnnnnn!!!! falls down!!!!
It ain't nothin but a blessed day today
The suuuuuuuuunnnnnnn!!!!! will shiiiiiinnnnnnnnnineeee!!!!
After the rain dries!!!!!
If the raaaaaaaaiiiiiiiiiinnnnnnn!!!! falls down!!!!
It ain't nothin but a blessed day today
The suuuuuuuuunnnnnnn!!!!! will shiiiiiinnnnnnnnnineeee!!!!
After the rain dries!!!!!
