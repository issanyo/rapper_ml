[Intro: Wyclef Jean]
To my people doing time
To my people rest in peace (y'all ready for the refugee camp?)
Introducing Earth, Wind & Fire
Yah yah yah
Come on come on come on

[Verse 1: Wyclef Jean]
No money in my pocket
Gotta get a no limit
So I became America's most wanted
All I ever wanted was a fancy car
A crib for my mom and a MasterCard
Baby you know it's in Hollywood
New cop flicks with Clint Eastwood
Went from a teen to a young adult
No excuses ain't my fault

[Pre-Chorus: Wyclef Jean]
Runaway
We living like runaways
Wake up
Stretching in the morning
Trying to make it through the day
Brush my teeth
Hit the streets
Where there's heat
We afford to beef
Hoping one day
We don't have to run away
(Gotta Escape)

[Chorus: Wyclef Jean]
I didn't want to run away
But I had to get away yo (gotta get away)
We didn't want to run away
But we had to get away yo (gotta get away)
I didn't want to leave astray
But sometimes I gotta get away yo (gotta get away)
I didn't want to go away
But I had to go away yo
Yo G&B where you at?

[Verse 2: The Product G&B]
Momma came home from a hard days work
At daytime a maid at night time a nurse
Work so hard to make sure we survived
Living a ghetto paradise
Sometimes I wake up screaming in the middle of the night
Hoping that darkness brings me light
Praying for that better day where we won't have to run away

[Pre-Chorus: The Product G&B]
Runaway
We living like runaways
Wake up
Stretching in the morning
Trying to make it through the day
Brush my teeth
Hit the streets
Where there's heat
We afford to beef
Hoping one day
We don't have to run away

[Chorus: Wyclef Jean]
I didn't want to run away
But I had to get away yo (gotta get away)
We didn't want to run away
But we had to get away yo (gotta get away)
I didn't want to leave astray
But sometimes I gotta get away yo (gotta get away)
I didn't want to go away
But I had to go away yo
Ladies and gentleman Earth, Wind & Fire

[Bridge: Earth, Wind & Fire]
Ba dow bo ba dow bo ba dow bo ba dow bo ba dow bo ba dow bo
(da da da da da da ) (Feeling melly y'all)
Ba dow bo Ba dow bo
(More peace y'all)
Ba dow bo Baw dow bo
Ba dow bo Baw dow bo
Bow da da da da

[Pre-Chorus: Earth, Wind & Fire]
Runaway
We living like runaways
Wake up
Stretching in the morning
Trying to make it through the day
Brush my teeth
Hit the streets
Where there's heat
We afford to beef
Hoping one day
We don't have to run away

[Chorus: Wyclef Jean]
I didn't want to run away
But I had to get away yo (gotta get away)
We didn't want to run away
But we had to get away yo (gotta get away)
I didn't want to leave astray
But sometimes I gotta get away yo (gotta get away)
I didn't want to go away
But I had to go away yo
I didn't want to run away
But I had to get away yo (gotta get away)
We didn't want to run away
But we had to get away yo (gotta get away)
I didn't want to leave astray
But sometimes I gotta get away yo (gotta get away)
I didn't want to go away
But I had to go away yo
Yo y'all gonna make me do it I don't want to do it but here we go

[Outro: Earth, Wind & Fire]
