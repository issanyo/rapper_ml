Lately I’m seeing ghosts
As far as the demons go
All the Knives in my back
What cut me the deepest though
I want a woman who cums as quick
As the weekend goes
Who’s got
More to offer
Than stories from Mykonos

I know you see the goals
I’m leaving so frequent though
The journeys a movie
We fell in love with the scenic road
How could I be opposed
Smile like comedic roles
Cause If ever we had odds
I Know that I evened those

You’ll never see it though
Still
Y’all evesdropping & screenshotting
While we plotting
Winters coming
Heats dropping
Studio on my 24th I was born for this
I left school
I left my girl
I left it all for this

& Ain’t no Nick of time to go running back
KeKe riding with you
Cause I ain’t love her back
Im in trouble but fail?
There’s not an option to
Y’all think its just music
All this pressure put me in the hospital
It Had me saying


Someone please call 911, yeah yeah (pick up the phone yo)
Tell them I just got shot down
And it's piercin through my soul (I'm losin blood yo)
Feel my body gettin cold


I think my minds playing tricks on me
Feeling like my thoughts flipped on me
Way too many eyes fixed on me
Visions blurred
Turned to black & then it switched on me

Feeling good
I’ve been calming the pressure
I see labels signing artists
But they calling me better
I'm with sorority members
Who could all be the jenners
Know you see it and you sweat it
Like it's hardly September

But it’s
It’s all good though
Cold with no emotion
I told you
I’m way too frozen to get broken
Hopin
I don’t end up like who I idolize
A Leo
Could see I’m lion in my eyes

Cause I wanna be great
But it goes with a price
I'm doing numbers
Like I’m rolling the dice & that’s nice
But I got a vice
Coming with everyone’s advice
I’ll be alright
Feels like I’m playing chess with my life
Got me screaming out

Someone please call 911, yeah yeah (pick up the phone yo)
Tell them I just got shot down
And it's piercin through my soul (I'm losin blood yo)
Feel my body gettin cold
Someone please call 911 (can you do that for me)
The alleged assailaint, was five foot one
And she shot me through my soul (and he shot me through my heart)
Feel my body gettin cold
(He didn't care, he didn't worry, he didn't wonder..)
