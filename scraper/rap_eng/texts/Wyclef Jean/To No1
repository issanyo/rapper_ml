I got so much inside my head
So why can't I get out of bed?
I got so much I'd like to say
So why do I waste away my days
Just sittin' hopin' prayin' something will come out?
Nothing left to show except my fear and my doubt

I just got a song
That I play to no one

Got so much I'd like to sing
I close my eyes I hear them screaming my name
I got so much I'd like to do
I always thought that by 22
I'd be sittin' pretty with 'bout five number ones
Never thought that I could feel so old this young

I just got a song
That I play to no one
And you can't sing along
Cause I play to no one

Oh, what good's a gift
Without somebody that I share it with?
And oh, what good am I
If I keep what I've got inside
When I know my future is bright?

I got a song
And I play to everyone
You will sing along
This song to someone
Cause I'll be someone
With this song to No1
