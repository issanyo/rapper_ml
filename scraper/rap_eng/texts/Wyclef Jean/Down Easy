[Verse 1: Starley]
Oh my darling, my darling, my darling
We're breaking
And I don't like the feeling of knowing you hurting
Can we stop and pretend that this ever happened?
Oh my darling, my darling
You know I can't take it

[Chorus: Starley]
Don't wanna be the one to break your heart
But I gotta tear your world apart
I let you down easy
I'd let you down easy if I could
And even though we used to have the spark
I'm putting out the fire before it starts
I let you down easy
I'd let you down easy if I could

[Post-Chorus: Starley]
I'd let you down easy if I could
I'd let you down easy if I could

[Verse 2: Wyclef Jean & Both]
I wonder, wonder
Why good things don't last forever
It feels like thunder
The way my heart be beating under pressure
Even if the fire's gone
We'll still light the match when the throne ends
And even though I lost the map
I'mma find a way back to the treasure

[Pre-Chorus: Wyclef Jean]
Easy
Let me down easy if you could
Easy
Let me down easy

[Chorus: Starley]
Don't wanna be the one to break your heart
But I gotta tear your world apart
I let you down easy
I'd let you down easy if I could
And even though we used to have the spark
I'm putting out the fire before it starts
I let you down easy
I'd let you down easy if I could

[Post-Chorus]
I'd let you down easy if I could
Easy, I'd let you down easy if I could

[Verse 3: Wyclef Jean]
You give it, you take it
And you take it when you want it
You don't want it when you got it easy
I want it and I need it
Like an addict gotta have it
But you keep my body feelin' freezy
You tease me, back and forth like a frisbee
Sleazy, every time you catch me so easy
Please leave, you don't ever need to see me
It'll never be so hard again
I'll make it easy

[Pre-Chorus: Wyclef Jean]
Easy
Let me down easy if you could
Easy
Let me down easy

[Chorus: Starley]
Don't wanna be the one to break your heart
But I gotta tear your world apart
I let you down easy
I'd let you down easy if I could
And even though we used to have the spark
I'm putting out the fire before it starts
I let you down easy
I'd let you down easy if I could

[Post-Chorus: Starley]
I'd let you down easy if I could
I'd let you down easy, I let you down easy if I could
Let you down, let you down, let you down, down, down
I let you down easy
I let you down easy
