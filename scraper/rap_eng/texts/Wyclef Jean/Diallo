[Intro: Wyclef Jean as Amadou]
Boy I am so tired
I'll be glad when I get inside the house
Oh, I dropped my keys
Oh, what tis bright light?
My God they must gonna rob me
Who these people with them all at they gonna rob me
I'm gonna take out my wallet to make sure they just get the money
Nothing else.. Oh shit, wait
Oh it's the police (*whew*)
I feel so much better
I will show them, I have my ID
So they know I am good people
Even though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death
I fear no evil for thou art with me thou ride with me
J-J-Jah! Ras-tafari
I can't forget you knotty dreads, y'all up in here
I gotta respect that, youknowhatI'msayin?
Night is in the air

[Pre-Chorus: Wyclef Jean]
Enemy on the borderline
Who'll be the next to fire
Forty-one shots by Diallo's side?
You said he reached sir
But he didn't have no piece sir
But now he rest in peace sir
In the belly of the beast sir
You guys are vampires
In the middle of the night
Suckin' on human blood
Is that your appetite?
You said he reached sir
But he didn't have no piece sir
But now he rest in peace sir
In the belly of the beast sir

[Verse 1: Wyclef Jean]
Have you ever been shot
Forty-one times?
Have you ever screamed
And no one heard you cry?
Have you ever died
Only so you can live?
Have you ever lived
Only so you can die again, then be born again
From these enemies

[Pre-Chorus: Wyclef Jean]
On the borderline
Who'll be the next to fire
Forty-one shots by Diallo's side?
You said he reached sir
But he didn't have no piece sir
But now he rest in peace sir
In the belly of the beast sir
You guys are vampires
In the middle of the night
Suckin on human blood
Is that your appetite sir?
You said he reached sir
But he didn't have no piece sir
But now he rest in peace sir
In the belly of the beast sir

[Chorus: Wyclef Jean]
Diallo, Diallo, similar to Steven Biko
Diallo, Diallo, you told me the murder was an error
Diallo, Diallo, but every man will be judged
Diallo, Diallo, according to his words

[Verse 2: Wyclef Jean]
Have you ever been held
Against your will?
Taken to a dark place
Where not even scientists can reveal?
So what is for Ceasar
Let it be for Ceasar
'Cause we don't want no peace
We want equal rights and justice.. for

[Chorus: Wyclef Jean]
Diallo, Diallo, similar to Steven Biko
Diallo, Diallo, you tell me that the murder was an error
Diallo, Diallo, but every man will be judged
Diallo, Diallo, according to his words

[Verse 3: Wyclef Jean]
You know what?
You told me, that I wouldn't understand man
Tonight some cry, in the streets a burial
Survival of the fittest, only the strong will survive
How can I survive, with forty-one shots by my side?

[Pre-Chorus: Wyclef Jean]
You guys are murderers
In the middle of the night
Killin' innocent people
Is that your appetite? Ohhh
You said he reached sir
But he didn't have no piece sir
But now he rest in peace sir
In the belly of the beast sir
You guys are vampires
In the middle of the night
Suckin on human blood
Is that your appetite?
You said he reached sir
But he didn't have no piece sir
But now he rest in peace sir
In the belly of the beast sir, liquor shot for

[Chorus: Wyclef Jean]
Diallo, Diallo, similar to Steven Biko
Diallo, Diallo, I can hear your spirit callin, I can hear it
Diallo, Diallo, ten thousand chariots with no riders
Diallo, Diallo, they on they way to America, I hear the tribe singin'

[Bridge: Wyclef Jean]
They're sayin', Diallo Diallo, tuye' Diallo
Diallo Diallo, tuye' Diallo
Diallo Diallo, tuye' Diallo
Diallo Diallo, tuye' Diallo
Diallo Diallo, tuye' Diallo
Diallo Diallo, tuye' Diallo
Diallo Diallo, tuye' Diallo

[Outro: Sample]
Now there ain't but 20,000 police in the whole town
Can you dig it? Can you dig it? Can you dig it?
