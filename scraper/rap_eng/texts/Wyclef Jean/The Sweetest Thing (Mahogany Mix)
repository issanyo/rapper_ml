[Intro]
Like a queen, a queen upon her throne
It was the sweet, sweetest thing I've known

[Verse 1:]
Uh, uh, uh
The sweetest thing I've ever known (ha)
Was like a kiss on the collar bone (no doubt)
The soft caress of happiness
The way you walk, your style of dress
I wish I didn't get so weak
Ooo baby, just to hear you speak (L-Boogie!)
Makes me argue just to see
How much you're in love with me

[Chorus:]
Was the sweet, sweet, sweetest thing I've known
Oh, Mahogany, mahogany, oh, Mahogany L
It was the sweet, sweet, sweetest thing I've known
Oh, Mahogany, mahogany, oh, Mahogony L

[Verse 2:]
I get mad when you walk away
So I tell you leave when I mean stay (stay)
Warm as the sun dipped in black
Fingertips on small of my back
More valuable than all I own (new hit!)
Like your precious, precious baby dark skin tone (L-Boogie!)

[Rap Verse :]
[Lauryn Hill]
I met him on the subway in Brownsville, Medina
God like Apollo, I follow like Athena
Keener, cleaner, just a few misdemeanors
Hit me in the heart, part profession-al cleaners
[John Forté]
Shorty dig, you wasn't from this side
We did the slide and let me whip your ride
L-Boogie had the flavor sized up a T
Vocal was exquisite, and still love the street
[Lauryn Hill]
I shoulda seen her like when Ike met Tina
How you were shooken when I booked the arena
Jakes had you locked up, fakes had us knocked up
Snakes in the state could have anybody popped
But we stayed in the struggle, prayed in the trouble
While you on the street, I'm on tour, we make double
[John Forté]
I held the heat fine and you held mics divine
With every cat singin' with you "one time!"
You was the media's dish
Locked [??]
Callin' me your lil' Brownsville Swedish Fish
[Lauryn Hill]
More times than not, it got hot tryin' to date you
You know I never meant it when I told you that I hate you
[John Forté]
And though durin' our turn, everyone tried to beat us
I keep you in my heart, you was always the sweetest

[Outro 2: Dirty Harry (Lauryn Hill)]
Ayo, L-Boogie—what happened to Peace?
(Peace)
