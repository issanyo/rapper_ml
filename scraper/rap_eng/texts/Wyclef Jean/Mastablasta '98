We love, we love, come again and rewind

[Intro]
If you're stuck in jail and you can't make bail
Let me hear you blow your horn
Yo, if you ain't gonna work 'cause your boss is a jerk
Let me hear you blow your horn
North, south, east, west, kill the stress
Let me hear you blow your horn
Yo, if you're ready for the master blaster
Everybody come on and come on and come on and come on and come on

[Verse 1: Wyclef Jean]
Everybody's looking jiggy
But it ain't jiggy no more
'Cause the world is full of problems
Young ones don't care if they live or die
Stevie: Hard time universe
From the latest hip-hop riddims
Biggie's hot on your box (yo, turn up your radio, kid)
Tonight there'll be a party
On the corner 'til the end of dawn

[Chorus:]
I bet you that you
Will be jammin' until the break of dawn
Nobody ever told me that you
You will be jammin' until the break of dawn
Nobody ever told me that

[Verse 2: Stevie Wonder]
You ask me am I happy
Well as a matter of fact
I can say that I'm ecstatic
'Cause we all just made a pact
We've agreed to get together
Joined as children in Jah
When you're moving in the positive
Your destination will be the brightest star

[Chorus: Stevie Wonder]
You would be jammin' 'til the break of dawn
Didn't nobody ever told you that you
Would be jammin' until the break of dawn
The wide world knows that you
(We're in the middle of the end of the master blaster jammin'!)
Would be jammin' until the break of dawn
You'll be jammin' until the break of dawn
Jammin' on

He's not my baby's daddy (then who is he?)
He's not my baby's daddy (then who is he?)
He's not my baby's daddy (Yo, it's the master blaster)

[Rap: Wyclef]
Yo, I'm the boogie boogie bang, zikky zikky zang
Zorro pass the sword so I can cut the bwoy's hand
Mr. Man In Blue had me reroute my plan
When I'm vex I got patois like a Jamaican
For your girl, she's buff puff
Daytime, don't play rough
Freaks come out at night, so that's when I bring out the cuffs
Grand Marnier, CD player #2
Sade's in my bedroom singing Sweetest Taboo
Come on, come on, come on

[Intro]
If you're stuck in jail and you can't make bail
Let me hear you blow your horn
Yo, if you're ready for the master blaster, everybody come on
Yo, that's just my baby mother
Let me hear you blow your horn
North, south, east, west, kill the stress
Let me hear you blow your horns, come on

[Chorus: Stevie Wonder]
Oh, you would be jammin' 'til the break of dawn
Wyclef: Jammin' 'til the break of dawn until the sun come out
Didn't nobody ever tell you that you
Wyclef: You would
Would be jammin' until the break of dawn
Can't nobody ever... I'm tellin' you
We'll be jammin' 'til the break of dawn
Jammin' jammin' jammin' jam on

We love, we love, come again and rewind
Mr. Stevie Wonder
We love, we love, come again and rewind
Mr. Jam & Lewis
We love, we love, come again and rewind
To the Can-I-bus
We love, we love, come again and rewind

Takin' you to paradise
