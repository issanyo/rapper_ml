Welcome to my country

Man, when it's cold in New York (uh)
I jump on my G4 (yeah)
I head out to Haiti (yeah)
Go chill in the Caribbean

Sippin' Refugee rum (yeah)
Under the coconut tree (yeah)
We gonna bounce the world with a new dance from the refugee
1-2-3, let's go

Everybody do the kompa (all the ways)
Everybody do the kompa (keep your hips in place)
Everybody do the kompa (two steps get closer)
Everybody do the kompa (wind your body like you know her)

I see y'all do the Macarena
I see you dance to the salsa
I see you move it to the cha cha (slide)
Everybody do the kompa

Oh Mickey, you're so fine
You're so fine, you blow my mind
Hey Mickey

That's when they take on the real lance
So leave your guns and knives at home
Refugees on the right peform

Say, Milky just walked in the dancehall tonight

I'm the Haitian princess
With the peoples band
Every time the djs play us
People jump around and pay us

After call them shades
Now put your hands up on my waist
No need to come to the altahome
And wash your sheets and I'm on the phone

We've been kicked, we've been stabbed, we've been shot
Lord we've been abused, Lord knows
Everytime they throw us down
We stand up and hold our ground

Get it right, get it right
Get salsa, samba
What if I told you it came from kompa

Fill my culture
This is the blood and the warrior from Haiti, oh Lord
This is the Bicentennial
