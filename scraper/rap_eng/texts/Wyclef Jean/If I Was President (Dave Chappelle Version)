[Hook]
If I was president
I'd get elected on Friday, assassinated on Saturday
Buried on Sunday, they'd go back to work on Monday
If I was president
If I was president

[Verse 1]
Instead of spending billions on the war
I can use that money, to feed the poor
I know some so poor, when it rains that's when they shower
When screaming "fight the power"
That's when the vulture devoured

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
But the radio won't play this
They call this rebel music
How can you refuse it, children of moses?

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Tell the children the truth, the truth
Christopher Columbus didn't discover America
Tell them the truth, the truth
YEAH! Tell them about Marcus Garvey
Tell the children, the truth, yeah! The truth
Tell them about Martin Luther King
Tell them the truth, the truth
Tell them about JFK
If I was President

[Hook]
