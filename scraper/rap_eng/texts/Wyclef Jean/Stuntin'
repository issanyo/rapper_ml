[Intro:]
She said she always gonna be, daddy's little girl
Look at her style, look at her swag
Look at her stuntin like

[Hook:]
I be stuntin like my daddy did, stuntin like my daddy did
Everywhere I go man I'm stuntin like my daddy did
All you gotta do is look into my eyes
Look into my dream yo, it can never die
She stuntin like her daddy man, she stuntin like her daddy
Everywhere she go, yea she be stuntin like her daddy
I love your cat walk, the way you hold your head high
You got every man lookin but they can't get the prize

[Verse 1:]
I gotta do this for my mama, gotta do this for my daddy
In the middle of the block, gotta make it for my homies
My little brother playing ball
That he says if you win to get then have it all
George Michael swag, so all I do is hate the fate
Look at the pictures on the wall, my dad's amongst the great
Designer this, designer that, I'm running out of closet space
But daddy never let it get to my head, amazing grace

[Bridge:]
The boys don't want to play
Once they know my daddy's weight
They don't misbehave, they don't wanna see the great
I can do without the pain, gotta treat this baby
Like every day is my birthday

[Hook:]
I be stuntin like my daddy did, stuntin like my daddy did
Everywhere I go man I'm stuntin like my daddy did
All you gotta do is look into my eyes
Look into my dream yo, it can never die
She stuntin like her daddy man, she stuntin like her daddy
Everywhere she go, yea she be stuntin like her daddy
I love your cat walk, the way you hold your head high
You got every man lookin but they can't get the prize

[Verse 2:]
Well I'm stuntin like my daddy, I'm not daddy's little girl
Got my passport stamped up all around the world
With my red dress depend at all
Sport cars, gold, diamonds and Taj Mahal
Eyyy, here's the plan, let's get a jet
World tour, Bangladesh, what's next?
Every man got a tattoo with you on they chest
Trust me, I'm clairvoyant when it comes to dreams
I told Destiny's Child that they would be the young supreme

[Bridge:]
The boys don't want to play
Once they know my daddy's weight
They don't misbehave, they don't wanna see the great
I can do without the pain, gotta treat this baby
Like every day is my birthday

[Hook:]
I be stuntin like my daddy did, stuntin like my daddy did
Everywhere I go man I'm stuntin like my daddy did
All you gotta do is look into my eyes
You can see my dream yo, it can never die
She stuntin like her daddy man, she stuntin like her daddy
Everywhere she go, yea she be stuntin like her daddy
I love your cat walk, the way you hold your head high
You got every man lookin but they can't get the prize
