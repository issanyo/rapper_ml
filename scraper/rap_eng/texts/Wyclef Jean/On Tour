Ladies and gentleman
The world music ambassador Wyclef Jean's in the house
Alongside of sexy Lucia
Jan, let it go
Let it go
Let it go
Let it go
Let it go
Let it go
Let it go
Let it go
Let it go

I'm told, I was partying with the Russians in a yacht
Ass bigger than a hat and saw a girl
Asked her where's she's from
That's when she replied, "You're a bi!"
I'm drunk, got it going dippy-dong-dong
And the way she move her body, now I'm dippy-dong-dong
She hide like the sun, got me dippy-dong-dong
Murder She Wrote, what a bomb-bomb!

(Women sing) If you look into my eyes you can see my cheri amour
(Wyclef) I want it
(Women sing) Does it feel like a dischevel? when I tell you that I want you
(Wyclef) Yes it do
(Women sing) Would you be my lover now, and tempt me off from danger
(Wyclef) I'd love to

So let's dance on a dial, the party no style
When you party on a yacht, you don't worry about cops
They can shut us down
They can shut us down
They can shut us
They can shut us
They can shut us down

I'm told, I was partying with the Russians in a yacht
Ass bigger than a hat and saw a girl
Asked her where's she's from
That's when she replied, "You're a bi?"
I'm drunk, got it going dippy-dong-dong
The way she move her body, now I'm dippy-dong-dong
She hide like the sun, got me dippy-dong-dong
Murder She Wrote, what a bomb-bomb!

(Women sing) If you look me in the morning and you hit me lights, I make love
(Wyclef) I'd love to
(Women sing) I can feel that you were sent to me from up above, my love
(Wyclef) I want you

Cus when I look into your eyes, you're so god-divine
Tiki-tiki-taka, you got me, hear my thighs
So let's dance on a dial, the party don't style
When you party on a yacht, you don't worry about cops

I'm told, I was partying with the Russians in a yacht
Ass bigger than a hat and saw a girl
Asked her where's she's from

I'm drunk, got it going dippy-dong-dong
The way she move her body, now I'm dippy-dong-dong
She hide like the sun, got me dippy-dong-dong
(Emergency)
Murder She Wrote, what a bomb-bomb!

Put up your cup if you're feeling dizzy-dizzy-dizzy
Magnum pop if you're feelng dizzy-dizzy-dizzy
If you see me then get a little dizzy-dizzy-dizzy
Come closer let me get a kissy-kissy

(Women sing) If you look into my eyes you can see my cheri amour
