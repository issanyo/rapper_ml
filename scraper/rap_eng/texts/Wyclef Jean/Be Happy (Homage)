[Verse 1]
How can I love somebody else
If I can't love myself enough
To know when it's time
Time to let go
Sing

[Chorus]
All I really want
Is to be happy
Find a love that's mine
It would be so sweet
All I really want
Is to be happy
Find a love that's mine
It would be so sweet

Ooh la-la-la
It's the way that we rock when we're doing our thing
Ooh la-la-la
It's the natural vibes that the Lioness brings
Ooh la-la, la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la
Sweet thing

[Verse 2]
I ask for sign
From the sweet Lord above
I know the answer is in front of me
But when you think you're in love
You only see what you wanna see
All I see is me for you
And you for me

[Chorus]
All I really want
Is to be happy
Find a love that's mine
It would be so sweet
All I really want
Is to be happy

Ooh la-la-la
It's the way that we rock when we're doing our thing
Ooh la-la-la
It's the natural vibes that the Lioness brings
Ooh la-la, la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la
Sweet thing

[Bridge]
If you love me, say it
If you trust me, do it
If you want me, show it
If you need me, prove it
If you love me, say it
If you trust me, do it
If you want me, show it
If you need me, prove it

All I really want is for me to be happy
All I really want is for me to be happy
All I really want is for me to be happy
All I really want is for me to be happy

[Outro]
All I really want
Is to be happy
Find a love that's mine
It would be so sweet
