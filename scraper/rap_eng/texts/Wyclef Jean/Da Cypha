[Intro: Wyclef Jean]
Yo 1, 2, 1, 2, the Ecleftic is back with some adjustments
Refugee Camp (Turn it up! Turn it up! Turn it up!)
Yo, you see them Refugees right there, they goin' in the car

[Chorus: Wyclef Jean]
(WooWooWooWooWoo) Keys, they goin' in the trunk
(WooWooWooWooWoo) Fiends, they don't give a (uh)

[Verse 1: Marie Antoinette]
And Flex couldn't save you even if he dropped a bomb in this
You still gon be found in a ditch
My name should be Robin Banks the way I be robbin' banks
I'm a fiend for the S-500, I want it
Used to stay high and blunted, but all that had to stop
Chick like me be chasing after cops
And they don't stop at my block after the Diallo shootin'
Soldiers in waitin', marksmen recruitin'
Salutin, thug confederates, rhyme and reason
Time and treatin', Air Force One we leavin'
Panama red, holdin' 52 hands for ransom
My man Johnny Handsome, itchin' to cancel 'em
I'm like hold up, wait a minute, let's get down to business
We could shoot up everything soon as the deal is finished
Blah, blah, I got two hours to kill
We want like 5 mil in a private jet so peel

[Verse 2: Supreme C]
Supreme C been after mean figures, ask my lil nigga
Since back in the days, before you was raised
Ain't nobody puttin' fear in my heart, who need a jumpstart?
My art sharp, shoot your posse apart
Nigga take you on one by one, gun by gun
Son by son, done by done
Whoever come, murderfest, one of the best
I'm gettin' assets, collect ass bets, squat by your address
I come to kick it with you, walk beans stickin' with you
Why try to hide from accomplice vibe
Yo we break bread, break heads, my people shake feds
Gamble and scramble, F what your man do
It's all about this husltin' game, muscle and fame
Tussels in rain, take aim, blush you with game
My language is unexplainable, switch, changeable
And I stay remaindable, with bigger guns aimed at you

[Chorus: Wyclef Jean]
(WooWooWooWooWoo) Keys, they goin' in the trunk
(WooWooWooWooWoo) Fiends, they don't give a (uh)

[Verse 3: Hope]
I run up in Da Cypha heavily armed
With endless bars of metaphorical harm
A python with poisonous charm, extending my arm
Pushing figures way to the back
Out of your reach, excessive like Fatal Attract
Freeze, a renegade bar stroke, an ace of spades
I'll kiss you with a blade when I think I'm gettin' played
Made woman, you never in bed with the same woman
You say you want it, you don't wanna see the omen
When my sixth sense start flowin' I bless like holy water
I don't wanna die 'cause I'm my daddy's only daughter
But yo, sometimes I see the writin' on the wall
You know the ghetto testaments, the shootouts, the brawls
Close frames in the hall, will you stand or will you fall
Your whole click is on the run now would you tell it all
About the night shifters, me, I'm a cypher drifter
My sixteen bars is up, so peace to the mixers

[Chorus: Wyclef Jean]
(WooWooWooWooWoo) Keys, they goin' in the trunk
(WooWooWooWooWoo) Fiends, they don't give a (uh)

[Verse 3: Wyclef Jean]
October 31st, I was standing by the sour
These thugs don't wanna talk, they want these Pumas I just bought
Fresh outta school, picked on 'cause I'm bilingual
I barely spoke English but the gun language was universal
Ran in the grocery store, spoke to Gabriel
He said, "You have problems?" ere's a feezy from Israel"
Ran back outside, just before I could say
"Bismillah ir rahman," another homicide
Threw the biscuit in the bushes runnin' like Jesse Owens
Police showed up, but I was nowhere in existence
Back in the crib thinkin' 'bout what I just did
I'ma plead self-defense but I'm bound to catch this bid
My hypothesis was right, they knocked the door, homie
Like a super in the projects wantin' rent money
Just when I thought I get my life straight in the states
Is when I found myself climbin' down the fire escape
Bodies found in Virginia under the dumpsters, no
18 shell cases in front of the grocery sto'
Flee the scene of the crime before y'all kick the door
No your honor that must be some old rhyme that I wrote
And lyrics sometime man they misinterpret it
For example when I say gun I mean my pen and paper
And every time I wave and spit the crowd jump
'Cause I'm still Digital Underground like "humpty hump"
Feel the funk comin' through your elephant trunks
I ain't even *Kriss Kross* my clothes yet
And yet y'all wanna

[Break: Wyclef Jean]
(Jump! Jump!) You in Da Cypha
(Jump! Jump!) You in Da Cypha

[Chorus: Wyclef Jean]
(WooWooWooWooWoo) Keys, they goin' in the trunk
(WooWooWooWooWoo) Fiends, they don't give a (uh)

[Bridge: Wyclef Jean]
Stay in the house when you hear (WooWooWooWooWoo)
It means the murder's outside, you hear (WooWooWooWooWoo)
Where the real killers at? You hear (WooWooWooWooWoo)
Honey who chill with the gats, you hear (WooWooWooWooWoo)
Yo, don't talk crap, man (WooWooWooWooWoo)
Just 'cause your girl's with you man (WooWooWooWooWoo)
'Cause both of y'all gon go, man (WooWooWooWooWoo)
To a place where no man knows, man (WooWooWooWooWoo)

[Outro: Wyclef Jean]
Femme fatale, Hope
Supreme C, kinda dope
Marie Antoinette in the back with the techs
Y'all know the flavor, Refugee Camp
