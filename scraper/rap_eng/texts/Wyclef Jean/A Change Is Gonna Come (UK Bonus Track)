[Lauryn Hill] Yo!
[Wyclef Jean] One time!

I was born by the river in a tenement
And oh.. my poor mother, she could hardly pay the rent

[Refrain:]
It's been a long a long time coming
But I know oohh.. a change is going to come
Awww yes, it will

[Wyclef Jean] Two time!

Yeah, it's been too hard living and I'm afraid to die (Why?)
I don't know what's out there, yeaah, yeaaah.. beyond the sky
Say it Wyclef, Say it

[Wyclef Jean] Check it out, uh uh, Awww Ma

Yo, See I go oohh.. to my brother
And I say brother, help me please
And he winds up, he winds up, knocking me, knocking me
Yeah, huh.. back down on my knees Ohhh!

[Wyclef Jean] Three time!

It's been times when I didn't think that I would last for long
But now we think they're bound... to carry on

[Wyclef Jean]
This has been the Fugees: L Boogie, Prize Well, Wyclef
The Refugees are OUT!
