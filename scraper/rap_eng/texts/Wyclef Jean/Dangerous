Lets Go

[Verse 1: Kaine]
She's fire, she's fine
She's his,  she's mine
Black barbie
I'm ken
She's got honey melon-dew skin
I ain't really trying to let you in
But you can spend your Benjamins
Make no mistake thinking she's your friend
This is all about dividends

[D-Roc]
Wait, she like to play games
And she don't care who she play wit'
She do what she do
And she gon' get what she gon' get
She hit the strip club
And she gon' make her money quick
Shake ass on the pole
Bes' believe lil mama thick

[Wyclef]
I like the way
The way she dance
She take the thug
Put them in the trance
She shake that ass
Like an avalanche
Look into her eyes
And you taking the chance
I see the fire in her eyes
Fire in her eyes
Like the way she moves
She got the fire in her eyes
Fire on her waist
Fire in her thighs
I love the scandal

[Chorus]
She's so dangerous (dangerous)
She's so dangerous (dangerous)
She's so scandalous (scandalous)
I love the scandal
Hear me sing
Wohoo Here she comes
Watch out boy she'll chew you up
She's dangerous (dangerous)
Dangerous (dangerous)
I love the scandal

[Verse 2: D-Roc]
Pretty black skin
Shawty gon' make spend all my ends
When I leave I'mma tell my friend
And we both coming back again
And I'm looking for that girl
That danced for me the last time
Shawty get crunk so I'mma get her to dance for me four more times

[Kaine]
Thick and chunky
Work that monkey
Pop that money
Boy she want it
All up on it
They gon' pay her
Shawty 'bout bread so you can't play her

Dangerous (black girl)
Scandalous

[Chorus]

[Verse 3: D-Roc]
Get crunk lil mama
Lemme see you move
Dirty dancing all in the nude
Get crunk as shit
She about 5'6"
So I spend the money to see it
I love them girls that belly dance
Drop it down low
And shake that ass
Like whoa
Shorty look like her ma
Remind me of a coke cola bottle

[Kaine]
She a bad-ass broad
With her mind on the riches
So bad she pimp out bitches
All about that mighty dolla
You ain't talking bread boy
She ain't gonna hollah
745 (She gon' get it)
Big ol' eyes (?)
Tell 'em why
She already did it
Oh boy (?)
Only rotate 'bout digits
