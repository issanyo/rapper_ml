(feat. Wyclef Jean)

Aman Aman Aman Aman
Aman Aman Aman Aman

(Whyclef JEAN Rap)

Like a flame it's burning up
I can see it taking off
Never felt this way before
I'm so lost in you uuh
We don't even need to speak
I just need to feel your heat
Skin to skin do it sin to sin come on
Baby make me uuh uuh

I wanna get to know you in the physical
I wanna go below
Get you get you all alone
And then we let it go

WHY DON'T WE DO IT
START THE PARTY YADI
MOVE YOUR BODY YADI
GET RIGHT INTO IT
GROOVE YOUR BODY YADI
UUH YOU'RE NAUGHTY NAUGHTY
SHAKE IT UP SHAKE IT DOWN
TURN ME ON NOW, KEEP ME UP ALL NIGHT

Aman Aman Aman Aman
Aman Aman Aman Aman

I like the way you play it cool
But ? know you want me too
Make me sweat you gotta make me sweat
Baby make make cross the line
Say it all
All you need and I will fall
Let me be the one you call
If I touch you there
Will it oyu mine

I wanna get to know you in the physical
I wanna go below
Get you get you all alone
And then we let it go

WHY DON'T WE DO IT
START THE PARTY YADI
MOVE YOUR BODY YADI
GET RIGHT INTO IT
GROOVE YOUR BODY YADI
UUH YOU'RE NAUGHTY NAUGHTY
SHAKE IT UP SHAKE IT DOWN

Aman Aman Aman Aman
Aman Aman Aman Aman
Aman Aman Aman Aman
Aman Aman Aman Aman

(Whyclef Jean Rap)

(Chorus)
Aman Aman Aman Aman
Aman Aman Aman Aman
Aman Aman Aman Aman
Aman Aman Aman Aman
