[Intro: Wyclef Jean]
Dearly beloved
I wanna dedicate this song
To all my refugees around the world
My shottas
My Zoe's
HM, and all the sets around the world, one gang now

[Chorus: Marx Solvila]
Little shotta boy, we gon' make it out the hood one day
No more drugs dealin', no more gunplay
The G5's landin' on the runway
You know that the world is yours
Lost a couple good friends 'long the way
Coming from the slums, we make mistakes
Yeah, yeah

[Verse: Wyclef Jean]
Life's like a carnival every day
But we stay sucker-free, no clown face
'Cause them boys Bugs Bunny jumpin' for the carrots
Repeating everything to the Feds like parrots
But all I see's the future ahead
A new start like when I cut off my dreads
Statistically, I ain't even supposed to be here
Bad Christmas, I never seen a reindeer
You beat me, we all got our ego
You sniffin' on that Hulk though, Lou Ferrigno
We go ape, y'all just pose like ya'll killers
I know King Kong when I see him, y'all Magilla Gorillas
Ever had to face pressure?
Squeeze the crack so far up your ass
That you woke up with a ulcer
Yeah, them the homies that I know
They either deported or they ain't comin' home no more

[Chorus: Marx Solvila]
Little shotta boy, we gon' make it out the hood one day
No more drugs dealin', no more gunplay
The G5's landin' on the runway
You know that the world is yours
Lost a couple good friends 'long the way
Coming from the slums, we make mistakes
Yeah, yeah

[Verse 2: Jazzy Amra]
I'm just tryna make it out the slums
And turn our dreams into reality
Little shotta boy, I'll hold you down
Until the day they come and bury me
Queen of the castle, the leader of the pack
I send my troops into battle
Sexy and classy, but don't let it fool ya
You can catch me in the cut, posted up with that Ruger
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 3: H1 Da Hook]
I followed my calling
You can picture me broke and you could picture me ballin'
American gangster, the Haitian's behind me
District thirteen posted up, if you boys wanna come find me
And my shooters stay with me, a natural born leader
I'm the OG of the block, I testify like the preachers
All my niggas that's with me, take a puff of that reefer
I don't do it for myself, I do this shit for my people
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Chorus: Marx Solvila]
Little shotta boy, we gon' make it out the hood one day
No more drugs dealin', no more gunplay
The G5's landin' on the runway
You know that the world is yours
Lost a couple good friends 'long the way
Coming from the slums, we make mistakes
Yeah, yeah

[Bridge]
I'm by the river
Don't complicate me
God ain't touched me
I ain't saved yet
I'm by the river
Please be patient
God ain't touched me
I ain't saved yet

[Chorus: Marx Solvila]
Little shotta boy, we gon' make it out the hood one day
No more drugs dealin', no more gunplay
The G5's landin' on the runway
You know that the world is yours
Lost a couple good friends 'long the way
Coming from the slums, we make mistakes
Yeah, yeah
