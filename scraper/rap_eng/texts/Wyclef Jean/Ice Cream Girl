Ice cream girl

Give me an ice cream girl for the weekend
The kinda of girl she built for any season
For the winter, for the fall
Even in the summertime there's no fall

You want an ice cream girl for the weekend
A pocket full of dough you gonna blow on the weekend
Young, fresh and clean, know what I mean?
Everybody knows a fiend that loves the ice cream

My rum raisin', she drunk in the club
Pistachio a nut, she always boosting
She got a man, he's always shooting
And her daddy left her when she was eighteen
Do whatever for a hit, I seen her pawn her jewelry
Rowdy, rowdy, she the life of the party

She's in that Limousine
Look like something from a magazine
She's such a beauty queen
Got me spending all my cream

Give me an ice cream girl for the weekend
The kind of girl she built for any season
For the winter, for the fall
Even in the summertime there's no fall

You want an ice cream girl for the weekend
A pocket full of dough you gonna blow on the weekend
Young, fresh and clean know what I mean
Everybody knows a fiend that loves the ice cream

Once upon a time, let's go back to the scene
She was the prom queen and you were the prom king
Pinky, swear that you'll never separate
'Cause you was the draft pick for the NBA

I used to worry 'bout your best friend
I don't trust nobody named Frosty, The Snow Man
Frosty wore a wire
Now ice cream man is up in Riker

He reminisce about the Limousine
Look like something from a magazine
She's such a beauty queen
Had him spending all his cream

Give me an ice cream man for the weekend
Body toned up and ready for the beaches
Young, fresh and clean, know what I mean?
Everybody knows a fiend that loves the ice cream

You want an ice cream girl for the weekend
A pocket full of dough you gonna blow on the weekend
Young, fresh and clean, know what I mean?
Everybody knows a fiend that loves the ice cream

D.E.A. they knock on the door
I don't know what they knocking for
Ain't no ice cream up in here
Ain't no ice cream up in here, yeah

I used to stand on the block, I used to hear pop, pop
Another lad got popped in the ice cream shop
It's an ice cream war out here
We got an ice cream war out here, talk to me

Hurry, hurry, hurry, Mr. Ambulance, hurry
'Cause them kids in the club
And they OD'd on some cookies and cream
And now they sipping on the sizzurp, sizzurp, sizzurp, si-si-si-sizzurp

I tried to warn him but he didn't wanna listen
So he woke up in the same place in the same position
Like Pookie from New Jack City your body getting cold turkey
Your mind is getting so worried your head is spinning so dizzy

He reminisce about the Limousine
Look like something from a magazine
She's such a beauty queen
Had him spending all his cream

Give me an ice cream man for the weekend
Body toned up and ready for the beaches
Young, fresh and clean, know what I mean?
Everybody knows a fiend that loves the ice cream

You want an ice cream girl for the weekend
A pocketful of dough you gonna blow on the weekend
Young, fresh and clean, know what I mean?
Everybody knows a fiend that loves the ice cream

For the love of the ice cream, one man, ice cream girl
They incarcerated him for the ice cream
He will never get the chance to see
His daughter eating ice cream, woah, I

Give me an ice cream girl for the weekend
The kind of girl, she built for any season
For the winter, for the fall
Even in the summertime there's no fall

Give me an ice cream man for the weekend
Body toned up and ready for the beaches
Young, fresh and clean, know what I mean?
Everybody knows a fiend that loves the ice cream

Ice cream girl, ice cream girl, ice cream girl
