[Bridge: Chance The Rapper]
It's a simple message
And it comes from the heart
Believe in yourself
For that's the place to start

[Hook: Chance The Rapper & Guests]
And I said Hey!
What a wonderful kind of day
We can learn to work and play
Get along with each other
And I said Hey!
What a wonderful kind of day
We can learn to work and play
Get along with each other

[Verse 2: Chance the Rapper]
Listen to your heart
Listen to the beat
Listen to the rhythm
The rhythm of the street
Open up your eyes
Open up your ears
Get together and make things better
By working together

[Bridge: Chance The Rapper]
Its a simple message
And it comes from your heart
Believe in yourself
As thats the way to start

[Verse 3: Chance The Rapper]
I'm gonna get by when the going get rough
I'm gonna love life 'til I'm done growing up
And when I go down
I'ma go down swinging
My eyes still smiling
And my heart still singing
I'm gonna get by when the going get rough
I'm gonna love life 'til I'm done growing up
And when I go down
I'ma go down swinging
My eyes still smiling
And my heart still singing
I'm gonna get by when the going get rough
I'm gonna love life 'til I'm done growing up
And when I go down
I'ma go down swinging
My eyes still smiling
And my heart still singing
I'm gonna get by when the going get rough
I'm gonna love life 'til I'm done growing up
And when I go down
I'ma go down swinging
My eyes still smiling
And my heart still singing
