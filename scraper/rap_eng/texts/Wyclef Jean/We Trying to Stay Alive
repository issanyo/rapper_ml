[Intro: Wyclef Jean]
We got the Refugee Allstars rub-a-dubbing in the club
Wyclef Jean, John Forte, Praswell
Nah mean, the streets are getting a little crazy

[Verse 1: Wyclef Jean]
Looka looka looka looka looka
Looka looka looka here looka shorty got back
Should I ask her for a dance? Hold on -- there's too many in the wolf pack
And besides, Dirty Cash talking to her
Buying her fake furs and taking her to The Fever
Quiet as it's kept, that ain't even his Benz
She spends his Franklins at the malls with her friends
Material girl, living in a material world
But it's all right cause it's Saturday night
So mister funkmaster, pump the Bee Gees
And all you college students, play your Ouijas
Check the spelling: r-e-f-u-g-e-e, get the CD from Sam Goody, hee hee!
You ain't even close with the rhymes that you wrote
Don't be mad cause you broke
Let me clear my throat -- ah huh ah huh
John Forte, grab the mic, let's sway this way

[Verse 2: John Forte]
I'm more than just a rhymer, you still a small timer
Hoping that the game treat that ass a little kinder
Every step tango'd
Your beef don't concern me
I'm eating mangoes in Trinidad with attorneys
My crew's slang flow worldwide like a current
With the every spot where nobody got insurance
Brother, do the math -- you ain't half near exotic
My man's claim true; you -- forget about it
Po-po just a nuisance, like my influence
Well, recognize you a lie trying do it
Got juiceâ€”told your lady
Oops! We Nutz Baby
Smooth and charismatic, automatic
You gonna save me
God bless the day that my sons survive
We strive to teach the youth, baby, and stay alive

[Verse 3: Pras]
Well, you can tell by the way I roll, shorty, that I'm a ladies man
A business man
Condos down the shore
Multi-million pension plan
But it ain't in my plan to make moves without the fam
I keep it intact
Yo 'Clef, do the track
John, play the mack while I pay the tax
Business as usual
Watching suspects steal my assets
Get cut with Gillettes
We built this concept, connect like NYNEX
Drinks at the bar, my American Express

[Interlude: Wyclef Jean]
Yo I cook up cook up
The copper pull up pull up
Then I cuff up cuff up
You who's calling bluff
Now you shook up shook up
Cause you lock up lock up
When I love up love up
You who's calling bluff
Hey yo, John is chilling
Dirty Cash dealing
What more can I say, we living
That's what we got, we got it good
And since you understood
We be...

[Outro: Pras]
Yeah
Live at the Carnival
97 till infinity
Ha
Refugee all-stars
Can't stop the shining, can't stop the shining
You wanna stop the shining? You wanna stop the shining?
Can't stop the shining, can't stop the shining
