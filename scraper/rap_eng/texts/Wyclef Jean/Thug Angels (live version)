Refugees yo.. all you say

Dirty dirty dirty south
I used to play while at the YMCA, in L.A
Sold my first AK
I saw her man get murdered on Sunday, bloody Sunday
(What about Texas?) They need to chill with the gun play
(New York city y'all) Police are at the door
The Magnum was by the ashtray
(Look at shorty y'all) He 'bout to go out like Scarface
He woke up in a cardboard box with no space
With Thug Angels singin', sayin'

(Huh, huh, hu-huuh
Uh-uh-uh-uh, uh-uh-uh
Huh, huh, hu-huuh)

So you wanna be a thug?
To all my thugs in Houston
You wan' push drugs?
To all my thugs in Memphis
You want the cars in the videos?
To the Jacksonville Thug Angels
Let me tell you how it really goes

I'm on the highway with a black bandana, headed to Atlanta
Until I heard woop woop, that sound of da police, should I pull over?
He had the dark shades on, but he ain't look like Stevie Wonder
His face was, pale and long - he looked like a cold day in December
Now let me ask the truth or somethin'
Should I slow down and be a good camper?
I heard a young thug scream
"It depends what you got in the beamer"
Now I got two choices I could blast and become most wanted in America
Or I could slow down like the man in the Bronco
And get Johnnie Cochran to be my lawyer
Ohh Sonya, hit her on the Motorola
If I get locked up I ain't getting out 'til Tuesday
'Cause this is Saturday, and it's a holiday
Now I got to spend a weekend in the south in jail
But you told me that crime paid

The dirty dirty dirty south
I used to play while at the YMCA, in L.A
Sold my first AK
I saw her man get murdered on Sunday, bloody Sunday
(What about Brooklyn?) They need to chill with the gun play
(Hey) Police are at the door
The Magnum was by the ashtray
(New Jersey) He 'bout to go out like Scarface
He woke up in a cardboard box with no space
With Thug Angels singin', sayin'

(Huh, huh, hu-huuh
Uh-uh-uh-uh, uh-uh-uh
Huh, huh, hu-huuh)

So you wanna be a thug?
My thugs in Chicago
You wan' push drugs?
My thugs in Orlando
Tou want the cars in the videos?
To V-A and D.C., St. Louis, Miami...

So you a killer, how many people did you kill?
You a dealer, how many drugs did you deal-a?
For'reall-a, used to sell crack on the hill-a
Yeah right, my name is Elvis and your wife is Priscilla
You're an actor, you need a part in this thrilla
Hold up, ain't no need to bust your four-fiff-a
There's two of us, one of us is bound to leave here in a coma
So say your prayers, and give my regards to the undertaker

I used to play while at the YMCA, in L.A

Watch out, for the beasts
Watch out, if you got a seed, homie
'Cause you don't want your kids growin' up
Thinkin' they never had no daddy

Big Pun, rest in peace forever
Bronx, pour some liquor, haaa
Slang Tom, rest in peace
To the outsiders, pour some liquor, haaa
(Let's go)
Police is in the news, watch yourself
Y'all saw what they did to Diallo
Hey, no pushin'
Back up, back up, back up, back up
(Get your hands out my pocket)
Y'all know, like I said on my last album
The record's not over yet
Back up, back up, back up

(You nigga, you betta turn music down, I call 911)

You gon' do what?
Woy! Yo, turn up your musics louder
Woy! All my people in the system Jeep
Woy! All my people goin' to school early in the mornin'
Woy! All my people in the college doors, talk to them

(Haitian singing to end)
