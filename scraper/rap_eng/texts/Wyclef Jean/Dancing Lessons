I wanna go walking with you
If you'd agree
I wanna do some talking with you
Where no one can see

I wanna go dancing darling
If you agree
I think I'll feel a safe step darling
If you were with me

And when you wrap your arms around me
When you take me close and say
That you're so happy and so glad you found me
You take my rainy days and make them go away

Long time I've been thinking of you
Do you think of me too?
Long time I've been dreaming of you
Make this dream come true

Long time I've been wondering about this
Can this really exist
I think I feel a peaceful feeling
In the warmth of your kiss

And when you wrap your arms around me
When you take me close and say
That you're so happy and so glad you found me
You take my rainy days and make them go away

On this journey may the good lord guide us
And may the goddess dance beside us

And when you wrap your arms around me
When you take me close and say
That you're so happy and so glad you found me
You take my rainy days and make them go away

And when you wrap your arms around me
When you take me close and say
That you're so happy and so glad you found me
You take my rainy days and make them go away
