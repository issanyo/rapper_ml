[Intro]
I got the skully to my face (hardcore)
I got the skully to my face (hardcore)
'Cause anything can happen at the Carnival
(Yo make room, make room, make room, make love, make room)
You can't stop the shining
Yo, don't slip, Mike
You don't want to go there is all, trust me
I know your girl with you, but you don't want to get embarrassed
Trust me

[Chorus]
Yo, when you're rolling to the Carnival, anything can happen
What, what, say what, say what, anything can happen
Making love to your girlfriend, anything can happen
What? Say what, say what, anything can happen
She's sleeping with your best friend 'cause anything can happen
Wh-a-at? Say what, say what, anything can happen
You roll down the block, come back with your gat
And pow, 'cause anything can happen

[Verse 1]
Feel this composition, it's a brand new dub
First thing I did was went to the pub
Tequila with worm, lemon, salt, and no rocks
'Cause when it hits my chest, it gots to be hot
Uh haha, stop, 'Clef can I rock, yo
Get out the bathroom, let me go again from the top
Feel this composition, I wrote it in the tub
First thing I did, was went to the pub
Tequila with worm, lemon, salt, and no rocks
'Cause when it hits my chest, it gots to be hot
Ahhh, stop, 'Clef can I rock
I'd like to give a shout-out to my people on the block
For you, Silly Willy playing thug cartoon
My infrared scope got your movements on zoom
Boom new toon, write songs in my room
Sleeping with the bride even though I ain't the groom
Your husband assume, come back with his goons
Put me in the trunk on your way to your honeymoon
Radio my platoon, Wyclef to Sev'
'I hear them playing Elvis, they on they way to Graceland
But they don't scare me, I'm in the trunk, I ain't sorry
Natural born killer who slept with the enemy'
Think quick -- what should I do? What did double-oh-seven do?
I pulled a bomb from my shoe
And exploded the trunk; I woke up half-drunk
Overlooked by a bunch of gypsies wit a bag of skunk

[Chorus]
You got the skully to your face, star, anything can happen
What, what, say what, say what, anything can happen
Sellin crack in the corner, man, anything can happen
What? Say what, say what anything can happen
I just got laid off, anything can happen
What, what, say what, say what, anything can happen
You don't wanna go there, 'cause anything can happen
What, what, say what, say what, anything can happen

[Verse 2]
Ayo, anything can happen, you can't stop the shining
You looking at my watch, but my mind's really the diamond
Nine to the Seven, you better off stepping
When I'm writing with my pen, it turns into a lethal weapon (Ding!)
Take this lesson to your next session
I suggest, you practice with the freshman
Sophomore, junior, then come check the senior
By then I would have graduated from the school of ruckus
Wyclef and Jerry Wonder, last of the producers
If the royalty ain't right, I put a call to Donny Ienner
But always stay humble, went from bummy to neat
'Cause money break groups up like the Five Heartbeats
Don't get souped 'cause you pushing a coupe
Next year you on foot, running from a lawsuit
For example, I know I'm nice, I don't front it
Least anticipated to the most wanted
Yeah, that's me in the spotlight
With a mic and a guitar, like M.O.P., I like it raw

[Chorus]
Yo, when you're rolling to the Carnival, anything can happen
What, what, say what, say what, anything can happen
Every man got disciples, anything can happen
What, what, say what, say what, anything can happen
Its all about survival man, anything can happen
Hah, say what, say what, anything can happen
You looking at me wrong, man, anything can happen
What, what, say what, say what, anything can happen

[Outro]
Will the Knicks win the championship this year?
Say what, say what, anything can happen
Will we find some peace of mind this year?
Say what, say what, anything can happen
You ready for the revolution this year?
Say what, say what, anything can happen
Will you make love with no condom this year?
No no, no no, that will never happen
The record is not over yet
The record is not over yet
The record is not over yet
Where the ladies at? Put yo' hands in the air!
And for the ladies, we won't play you
If you proud, shake what yo mama gave you, hey!
Whether your fat or slim, bubble your ting
Fellas if you need help, use ginseng
And for the ladies, we won't play you
If you fat, shake what yo mama gave you, hey!
Whether your fat or slim, bubble your ting
Refugee thugs hang at the roller rink
Roller skating, baby
Carnival (Make room, for the Carnival, make room)
And it don't, nine-seven to infinity
Rest in Peace, Rest in Peace
And the record is not over yet, the record is not over yet
