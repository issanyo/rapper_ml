Spin the bottle, if you lose come out your bikini wear
Kiss, like a Prince song

[Verse 2]
"Mirror, mirror on the wall
Who's the sexiest one of the all?"
He replied, "Girl, you are
A shooting star"
I can see through the dust
You're my diamond in the rough
Can't nobody get to us
We real and they faking the love
And we found our way
Out of the maze
From walking the block to running from cops
Now we shower in planes
And I'm off to Spain
To buy you a ring
And we go back to Vegas
What happened in Vegas we don't gotta say

[Verse 3] (Cro)
Yo
Don't know anyone that got a body like you
I know why they hatin 'cause they ain't in your shoes
Zieh' die High Heels aus, wir bauen 'n Baumhaus im Jungle
Bauen 'n Baumhaus im Jungle
'Cause you are so special
And I don't know anyone who compares to you
Baby and I like it, yeah
That you just dont know
[Wyclef] She came to party, yeah
Just dont know
[Wyclef] We came to party 2x
Just dont know
