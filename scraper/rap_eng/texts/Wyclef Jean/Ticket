[Intro]
For the ladies, all hands on deck

[Break]
Put your hands up
Fly your fingers in the air now

On tour like Mohamed, my man
And my shoes should be doing the dance
She love it when I rap and sing
Girl looking fly with the bad wolf earrings
Top shots playing the wall
Cinderella, she be working the ball
I think I'm in love
Come on over, girl, give me a hug
Yeah, when she get fixed that's the best time for make up sex

[Chorus]
I would take the train, plane, automobile
To get a ticket to your love, ticket to your love
I'd climb the mountains, do whatever it takes
To get to your love, addicted to your love

[Hook]
Oh, I'm insane
That's what Doctor Love tell me in my brain
Oh, I'm so crazy
Crazy when it comes to my baby

[Break]

[Verse 1]
Swimming through the seven seas
To keep you away from seven thieves
Girl, I got what you need
My soul, my mind, my heart to keep
You'll never be alone, girl, you gotta know
Tell me when to go
I can put your mind at ease
All you gotta do is give your heart to me
Show up in a time machine
Like tonight I'm gonna make sweet love to you
Don't make my waiting in vain

[Chorus]

[Hook]

[Break]

[Verse 2]
I wanna dry your tears when you're so hurt
You can always lean on my shoulder
So many miles, getting older
Every year getting closer
With you by my side, any place that we can find
Oh, girl, you know

[Chorus]

[Hook]

[Break]
