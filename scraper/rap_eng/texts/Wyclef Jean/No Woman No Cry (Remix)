*A dedication to all the refugees Worldwide, one time*
Say say say I remember when we used to sit
In a government yard in brooklyn
Oba oba-servin the crookedness
As they mingled wit tha good people we meet
Good friends weve had, oh good friends weve lost
Along the waaaaayyy
In the this great futur
You can't forget your past
So dry youre tears i say
To my peeps who passed away
No woman no cry
No woman no cry
Say Say Say
Hey little sister dont shed no tears
No woman no cry
Say Say Say
I remember when we used to rock
Ina project yard in jersey
And little georgie would make the fire light
As stolen cars pass through tha night
And then we'd hit the corner store
For roots, paper and brew
My drinks, my only remedy
For pain of losin family
But while im gone shorty
Everything is gonna b alright
Evreything is gonna b alright
Fugees come to the dance tonight
Everything is gonna b alright
Everything is gonna b alright
Evrything gonna b alright
The gun man is inda house tonight
But evrything is gonna b alright
O a oa o a oa o a oa o a oa o a oa o a i'm high oa o a oa o a
No woman no cry
No woman no cry
Hey little sister dont shed no tears
No woman no cry
Say say say
I remember wen we used to sit ina government yard in trench town
Oba oba-serving the hypocrits
As they mingled wit the good people we meet
Good friends we had, oh, good friends weve lost
Along the way heey
In this great future you can't forget your past
So dry your tears i say
No Woman no cry
No Woman no cry
Say say say
Hey little sister dont shed no tears
No woman no cry
