I'll never forget

Here's what they say when I came to Africa
"It's going to change my life."
I ain't understand what they were saying
Until I landed in Africa

I'll never forget the first time
My plane landed down there in Africa
10,000 people came to the airport
So they can come greet the Rasta

Arrived at the hotel, through that get-me start
After that called up my mother
I told then, "Thank you, mama, to all that drama
You'd said I would make it as an African."

I'm so proud to be African (so proud)
I'm so proud to be Africano (so proud)
She's so proud to be African (so proud, so proud)
She's so proud to be Africana (Nigeria, South Africa)
