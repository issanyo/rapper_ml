Ladies, ladies, there comes a time in your life
When you gotta do some things
That you never thought you would have to do

I ain't your superwoman, I ain't your wonder woman
I ain't gonna wash your clothes
I ain't the floor, you're walking on

I'm gonna keep the car
Stop caring where you are
Buy your own cigarettes, walk your own pets
I'm out the door

Tonight when you come home, I will be gone
Ladies
Tonight ain't gotta fight, I'll be alright
I've seen the light

When you turn on your radio and you hear her voice
You will know that she made her choice
This ain't another love song 'bout who done you wrong
Man she talkin' 'bout, she gotta roll out
She gotta roll out, she gotta roll out

She gotta roll out, she gotta roll out
She gotta roll out, she gotta roll out
She gotta roll out, she gotta roll out
She gotta roll out, she gotta roll out
She gotta roll out, she gotta roll out
She gotta roll out, she gotta roll out

Roll, roll, roll, roll
Roll, roll, roll, roll

Ladies, if you feel me, let me see your hands up
Hands up, hands up
Put your hands in the air like you just don't care
Keep on waving them, girls, I know, I know

Tonight when you come home, I will be gone
Ladies
Tonight, ain't gotta fight, I'll be alright
I've seen the light

When you turn on your radio and you hear her voice
You will know that she made her choice
This ain't another love song 'bout who done you wrong
Man she talkin' bout she gotta roll out
She gotta roll out, she gotta roll out

She gotta roll out, she gotta roll out
She gotta roll out, she gotta roll out
She gotta roll out, so she gotta roll out
She gotta roll out, she gotta roll out

(Roll out)
She gotta roll out, she gotta roll out
(Roll out, roll out)
She gotta roll out, she gotta roll out
(Roll out)

Roll, roll, roll, roll
(Roll out)
Roll, roll, roll, roll
(Roll out, roll out, roll out, roll out)

You took me for granted
All that pain drove me nearly insane
I can't take it anymore
That's why I'm out the door

Tonight when you come home, I will be gone
Ladies
Tonight, ain't gotta fight, I'll be alright
I've seen the light

When you turn on your radio and you hear her voice
You will know that she made her choice
This ain't another love song 'bout who done you wrong
Man, she talkin' 'bout, she gotta roll out
She gotta roll out, she gotta roll out

She gotta roll out, she gotta roll out
She gotta roll out, she gotta roll out
She gotta roll out, so she gotta roll out
She gotta roll out, she gotta roll out

(Roll out)
She gotta roll out, she gotta roll out
(Roll out, roll out)
She gotta roll out, she gotta roll out
(Roll out)

Roll, roll, roll, roll
(Roll out)
Roll, roll, roll, roll
(Roll out, roll out, roll out, roll out)

Ladies
Roll out, roll out, roll out, roll out
Ladies
