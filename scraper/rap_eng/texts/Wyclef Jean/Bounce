[Intro: Wyclef Jean]
Yo, man
You know what?
Here me and Sarah go again
She saw me talking to Shorty the other day, man
Shorty from the block
Yeah you remember, Shorty
That wasn't nothing man
We were just having a conversation about the studio
Nah, Sarah had to take it somewhere else
I mean, she know I'm down for her forever
I don't know why she even go there
Man, I guess I'm staying with you tonight, dog

[Pre-Chorus: Sarah Connor]
Heeeey
Oooh
I ain't gonna take this no more, no
No, baby

[Chorus: Sarah Connor]
Bounce, baby, out the door
I ain't gon' take this no more
Bounce, baby, out the door
Get up and move, don't make me act a fool
Just bounce, baby, out the door
I ain't gon' take this no more
Bounce, baby, out the door
Get up and move, don't make me act a fool
Just bounce

[Verse 1: Sarah Connor]
Said you're going with your boys today
And don't worry
Cause I'll be home late
But I know you're cheating
Out there creeping
You been freaking, babe
So let me tell you how it is gonna be
Yeah, you can run your game
But not on me, boy
So who the hell are you trying to kid?
You know this is what I did, I...

[Pre-Chorus: Sarah Connor]
I called your pager
And your two-way, boy
But no response
Start looking, and I found you in some other woman's arms
Don't try to front, boy
Cause I saw you there with my own eyes
Just get your stuff, boy
Cause I'm tired of hearing all your lies

[Chorus: Sarah Connor]
Bounce, baby, out the door
I ain't gon' take this no more
Bounce, baby, out the door
Get up and move, don't make me act a fool
Just bounce, baby, out the door
I ain't gon' take this no more
Bounce, baby, out the door
Get up and move, don't make me act a fool
Just bounce

[Verse 2: Sarah Connor]
Baby boy
I know you'll never find
No stuff as good as mine
She can't work you like I did
You can look, but you know I got the good shit
I know that you hating it
But you better stay with the one you're with
You made your bed and now you have to sleep in it, baby

[Pre-Chorus: Sarah Connor]
I called your pager
And your two-way, boy
But no response
Start looking, and I found you in some other woman's arms
Don't try to front, boy
Cause I saw you there with my own eyes
Just get your stuff, boy
Cause I'm tired of hearing all your lies

[Chorus: Sarah Connor]
Bounce, baby, out the door
I ain't gon' take this no more
Bounce, baby, out the door
Get up and move, don't make me act a fool
Just bounce, baby, out the door
I ain't gon' take this no more
Bounce, baby, out the door
Get up and move, don't make me act a fool
Just bounce

[Verse 3: Wyclef Jean]
So wait a minute, Sarah
Give me a chance to explain
I was just talking to Shorty
Don't even know her name
I ain't looking for no one
To come and take your place
Ain't no one out there, baby
That can fill your space
No need to find a nickle
Got a dime at home
Plus I love
Every night the freaky way we bone
I ain't trying to get gone
Ain't trying to play role
I'd rather stay
And be a part of your green eyed soul

[Chorus: Sarah Connor & (Wyclef Jean)]
Bounce, baby, out the door
I ain't gon' take this no more
Bounce, baby, out the door
Get up and move, Don't make me act a fool
Just bounce, yeah
Just bounce, baby, out the door
I ain't gon' take this no more
Bounce, baby, out the door
Get up and move, don't make me act a fool
Just bounce
So bounce
(What?)
(You know I ain't try to front you, girl)
Just bounce, baby
Bounce
(Why we got to go there?)
Don't make me act a fool
Just bounce
(You know I ain't trying to lose you, girl)

[Outro: Sarah Connor & (Wyclef Jean)]
Just bounce, baby
Bounce
(Sarah, take it)
Just bounce
