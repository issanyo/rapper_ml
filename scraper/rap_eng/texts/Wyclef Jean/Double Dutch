That’s the girls, man, they playing double dutch
That’s my man he rolling up the dutch
And that’s me man I am playing superhero
(Shazam)
Yah, now we running from the 50
718 boy they running from the 50
305 man they running from the 50
404 boy they running from the 50
Hawaii 50, man we running from the 50

[Verse 1]
Thank god for them bars over guitar
Nice with the hands
You need a partner we can spar
Other younglings that I know
Boy they don’t use hand guards
They use the trigger like quick drama dra
Yea, me and my brother with the bubble bust
I’m on the roof I’m screaming, I got the juice

1 brick, 2 brick, 3 brick 4
Now DEA boy they bringing down the door
Man they searching for that cocahina
Now my boy is deported back to Ponkakana
Yea, though they try to set me up like hurricane
I felt the horror man but I ain’t touch the cane
Yea, it’s still mucho trabajo
Though the road is rocky imma KO apollo
Where I come from? North Mon ah Die
Sling shot, hit birds from the sky
So when I landed in the country with eagles eyes
I’m in the kitchen cooking American pie

[Hook]
That’s the girls, man, they playing double dutch
That’s my man he rolling up the dutch
And that’s me man I’m playing superhero
(New case)
Yea, now we running from the 50
310 they running from the 50
973 boy they running from the 50
212 now they running from the 50
Hawaii 50, man we running from the 50

[Verse 2]
Best friends turns to ex-friends
We were recruited like the X-men
They got my whole firm tap
Wikeleaks I can hear them from the back
They gon have me go beast mode
And do two bars in mores code

Yea, but I can’t stand to see another COP
Take another life of a KID
And I can’t stand to see another NUT
That’s the futious style on the air YPD
LAPD, everybody’s frighten
Cuz when the storm comes you don’t to get hit with lightning

[Hook]
509 man we running from the 50
876 boy we running from the 50
514 man we running from the 50
Oh no, man we running from the 50

[Outro]
Everybody itchy with the Twitter finger

Always wanna, switch face negga
