The fulfillment of the life comes from
Being in the hut, Being in the projects
We wouldn't have it any other way
As we pass on the wealth to other generations
To our generations
We pass the mentality too
You dig me?
We never leave the hut
We never leave the projects
We always live like we in the mansion
Drama...Clef...Let go
