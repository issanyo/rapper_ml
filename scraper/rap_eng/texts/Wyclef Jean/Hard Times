[Intro]

[Verse 1:]
This one dedicated to those that come to NYC
Went from illegal aliens to the recalled ID
But once they break the law I see them boys turned to deportees
And it's the same story from Haiti down to Sicily
Them boys speak broken English, like what's the matter you?
Slurping in the rainbow got them thinking I knew voodoo
Okay Um just called me, said he got a job for us
Pick up the bag and see the guy and bring a the money a back for us

Oh, just for us I bring it back I mean I get the car
I'll give you a little something something just keep your mouth to shut
Now I'm in the station, they want information
My English not too good officer, I'm a Haitian
Maron is havin a bitchin, I got a coart a freakin a guy
That killed a guy that killed a guy
Then we get the charge and go bye
Ciao ciao mister Officer, wooh, this was a close one
You kept your mouth to shut, aye... you a good one

[Hook:]
Having a hard time in this crazy town
Having a hard time in this crazy town
If you make it in New York you can make it anywhere

[Verse 2:]
Broch pon as a baby, pops a moment of struggle
They could smile at the devil, and just laugh at the troubles
Didn't want us to prosper, we just labeled as mobsters
But we did what we got to, stood tall like an Oscar
An army with us, mumble then, uncle Micky with us
They know what it's like in the ping, over talent, can't forget em
You can't win I don't lose, stick with the both lose
Clef and I got a song, union like the locals
Colorful punch, white, black, yellow, pink, brown
And that old slice here, loudly without sound
Smell sweet, you move in numbers like ants on the ground
Take pictures like when you're a kid and yo aunts is around
Feet planted like roots, fire known to resist me
I'm stand up in my city, plus the Haitians is with me
Different world but the same, Clef know why we still standin
Green, white and red but the Haiti flag, poppin 2 cannons

[Hook:]
Having a hard time in this crazy town
Having a hard time in this crazy town
(Even though you have a hard time in this crazy town)
(Mama told me)
If you make it in New York you can make it anywhere
Having a hard times in this crazy town

[Verse 3:]
Fresh off the boat, land in Coney Island
A Haitian in Brooklyn, Dodgers stadium
Mischief night, throwin eggs off the roof, me and my brothers
My cousin got a connect, he want us to check with them good fellas
But mom told me don't tangle with Haitians, Sicilians
So when I said that on the score it was more than the writin
Welcome to a page of my black and white note yea
With dishwashers and maintenance and then turn the books
Learn to handle coves as quick, no fingerprints
Michael Jackson glove with a Desito brick
Drive by, we're ninjas, suited up gorillas
Where a man a leave you in the trunk for days, G Fellas
Yea the G Fellas connected with Italiani
Ran for president, I guess I'm movin like the Kennedy
And despite the hard times, the wear and tear
If you make it in New York you can make it anywhere

[Hook:]
Having a hard time in this crazy town
Having a hard time in this crazy town
(Even though you're having a hard time in this crazy town)
Having a hard time in this crazy town
(Mama told me)
If you make it in New York you can make it anywhere
Having a hard time in this crazy town
Having a hard time in this crazy town
Having a hard time in this crazy town
If you make it in New York you can make it anywhere
