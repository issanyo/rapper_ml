(Wy-Clef Jean)

We got the Refugees All-Stars rubba dubbin' in the club
Wyclef Jean, John Forte, Prizewell
Nah mean the streets are gettin a little crazy..
Looka looka looka looka looka
Looka looka looka here looka shorty got back
Should I ask her for a dance hold on theres too many in a wolf pack
And besides Dirtycash talkin to her
Buyin' her fake furs and takin' her to the fever
Quite as his kept that ain't even his Benz
She spends his franklins at the malls with her friends
Material girl, livin' in a material world
But it's alright cause its Saturday night
So mista funkmaster pump the Bee-Gees
And all you college students bring your ouijas'
Check the spellin, R E--F U G E--E get the cd from Sam Goody he he
You ain't even close wit the rhymes that you wrote
Don't be mad cause you broke
Let me clear my throat ah huh ah huh
John Forte grab the mic roots sway it this way

(John Forte)

I more than just a rhymer you still a small timer
Hopin that the game treat that ass a little kinda
Every step tango'd
Your beat dont concern me
I'm eatin mangos in Trinadad wit attorneys (oh yea)
My crews slang flow worldwide like a current
Wit da every spot where nobody get insurance
Brotha do the math you ain't half near exotic
My man's claim true - you - forget about it
Pope hoe just a new stance like my influence
Well recognize you a lie tryin do it
Got juice told your lady oops
We nuts baby
Smooth and charizmatic automatic
You gonna save me
Godbless the day that my sons survive
We strive to teach the youth baby and stay alive

(Wy-Clef)

Yo if you got more than
Dollar in your pocket right now put your hands up

(Prizewell (Dirtycash))
Yo yo
You can tell by the way I roll shorty that I'm a ladies man
A business man
Condos down the shore
Multi million pension plans
But it ain't in my plan to make move without the fam
I keep it intact
You Clef do the track
John play da mack while I pay the tax
Business as usuall
Watchin suspects
Steal my assetts
Get cut with gillettes
We built this concept
Connect like nynex
Drinks at the bar
My american express

(Wy-Clef)
Yo I cook up cook up
The cop a pull up pull up
Then I cuff up cuff up
You whos callin bluff
Now you shook up shook up
Cause you lock up lock up
When I love up love up
You who's callin bluff

(Wy-Clef)
