INTRO:
Horns please
Ladies and gentlemen
It's the return of the carnival man
Yeah
I know
I shouldn't have kept ya'll waiting so long
I know you miss me
Well alright then
Let's go

VERSE 1:
My girl we've been through ups and downs
The queen of my heart, the one with the crown
My girl when the clouds get gray
She send me an emoji with the smiley face
Sem simma, who got the keys to my beama
Like my brother beanie man in the middle of the summer
Slow wine like a dance hall queen
She makin' me feel forever seventeen

CHORUS:
You got that personality I like (ya)
Forbidden fruit I gotta take a bite (ya)
Ignore the hype cause you and I got something special
Special, ooohhhh

I will do whatever it takes
Words cannot express the way I'm feeling
You and I could rule the world
I will do whatever it takes
To show you I appreciate
You're my girl, my girl
My girl
You're my girl, my girl
My girl
You're my girl, my girl

VERSE 2:
If you like me check yes and if not check no
I could be your, I could be your island Romeo
I could be your, I could be your city Juliet
Your love got me spinning like Russian roulette

CHORUS:
You got that personality I like (I like)
Forbidden fruit I gotta take a bite (take a bite)
Ignore the hype cause you and I got something special
Special, ooohhhh

I will do whatever it takes
Words cannot express the way I'm feeling (talk to me girl)
You and I could rule the world
I will do whatever it takes
To show you I appreciate (my girl)
You're my girl, my girl
My girl
You're my girl, my girl
My girl
You're my girl, my girl

VERSE 3:
In the middle of the ocean dreaming
Ship sailing in the carribean evening
I can't watch her pass me by, no no no
In the middle of the night sky I see
A shinning star I believeing
We could do this thing for life

CHORUS:
I will do whatever it takes
Words cannot express the way I'm feeling (talk to me girl)
You and I could rule the world
I will do whatever it takes
To show you I appreciate (my girl)
You're my girl, my girl
My girl
You're my girl, my girl
My girl
You're my girl, my girl
