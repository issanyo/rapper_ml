[Intro:]
I'm I'm I'm just tryna show a better way
Every other day when your AK sprays
April Showers, lookin but they fallin every day
April Showers, lookin but they fallin every day
April Showers, lookin but they fallin every day
Every other day when your AK sprays
April Showers, lookin but they fallin every day
April Showers, lookin but they fallin every day

[Hook:]
I'm I'm I'm just tryna show a better way
Every other day when your AK sprays
April Showers, lookin but they fallin every day
April Showers, lookin but they fallin every day

[Verse 1:]
April Showers for fools, no mother nature includes
Just a smooth killer dude, they call me Troy Avenue
Harry Powder with the powder, they callin me on my boost
Blow race on the way but the crime rate get boost
Higher, no liar, I got that fire they desire
You know we can see nama, reconsider for you fathers
And they back, play it and that AK spray at people past
Many murders June, 2 May, we just back
Ha ha ha, bop bop bop, get away fast
Ruthless as my car and I pay straight cash
Money baby, stuntin no frontin baby
I'm lookin for a better way, don't see no come around maybe
I done heard some angels sing
AK, C Joe let em have it (Powder!)

[Hook:]
I'm I'm I'm just tryna show a better way
Every other day when your AK sprays
April Showers, lookin but they fallin every day
April Showers, lookin but they fallin every day

[Verse 2:]
I was raised on, 100 bars are better
My balls of steel, my delivery tougher than leather
It looks impossible when going up against Goliath
Until they see my slingshot, King David
My word play, all the words play
Before the legions faith back on they lost day
Like the circus even clowns are born with a purpose
Smile for the camera but I ain't picture perfect
But I'm a perfect star, see the pounds rising
You can take yo chance sky divin
Some say there's no sound like Wyclef, it's computer generated
Ya'll must not have heard the last 7 albums I got 7 out
Cause I got 7 out, I got 7 out
Cause I got 7 albums
I got 7 knockers, call me choir boy
Angel singing in my head, make a joyful noise
My papa always told me â€“ stand for the truth
Even when they goon up like them Tortuma goots
I'm back in the lap, predicates and adverbs
Yo man dead, see the power of words?
And that's nuclear, that's hysteria
Ahmed ben Hajad, North Korea
You getting money? Watch your paper chase
Every 3rd or 4th person is CIA
Every 5th and 6th person is DEA
Your best friend will turn snitch to put you away

[Hook:]
I'm I'm I'm just tryna show a better way
Every other day when your AK sprays
April Showers, lookin but they fallin every day
April Showers, lookin but they fallin every day

[Verse 3:]
I keep a light saber, Luke Skywalker
I'm flyin off the ropes, Jimmy Flysnooker
And I keep 2 girls, Jack Tripper
Yo Clef, can a brother get some stacks with ya?
And I'm still on that time, just hit
Reminds me of a trip like a Bushwick be
If you shout that the world is over
Because the debts, Bosa Nova with the Cosa Nostra

[Hook:]
I'm I'm I'm just tryna show a better way
Every other day when your AK sprays
April Showers, lookin but they fallin every day
April Showers, lookin but they fallin every day

April Showers, lookin but they fallin every day
Every other day when your AK sprays
April Showers, lookin but they fallin every day
April Showers, lookin but they fallin every day
