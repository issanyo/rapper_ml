[Intro:]
I'm a aks the new generation a question
Showin hands, how many ya'll wanna be the young and down?
How many ya'll wanna be the Kick Knowledge?
Show your hands, show you hands

[Hook:]
Listen, Kick Knowledge, young and down
Kick Knowledge, nah young and down
Kick Knowledge, nah young and down

[Verse 1:]
Kick Knowledge, man the college
I ain't stayed long, I went from the hood to a cottage
Pursued my dreams, started making beats
Ready or not, here I come, I'm with them Refugees
Young and down, I'm in the club
Gold chain, gold ring, the girlie luv them thugs
We poppin mollies, this is how we do
Middle finger at them haters, who the fuck are you?
Kick Knowledge, Haitian born
I'm the American Dream underground like Hariette Tubman
When beef sparks, my dogs bark
We play the front at the bus, Rose pops

[Hook:]
Kick Knowledge, young and down
Kick Knowledge, nah young and down
Kick Knowledge, nah young and down

[Verse 2:]
Young and down, I got 50 bitches
I keep them hoes in the block, see them bitches trickin
And I don't give a fuck what the bitches try to be
At the end of the night you better have my monthly
Kick Knowledge, I'm like Malcolm X
By any means necessary, man I keep a tab
Man I ran for president all them def beats
Got me paranoid, who they gonna shoot next?

[Bridge:]
Shit I Kick Knowledge
Shit I Kick Knowledge
Shit I Kick Knowledge
Young and down

[Verse 3:]
Young and down, man I'm so icy
So flashy, print our own money
With my face on it, Abraham Lincoln
Young and down, Sarah Palin
Kick Knowledge, I see you rap children
Before you buy the car, ya'll need to buy the building
Cause time gon come you gonna make that cake
And you gotta fall back on that realestate
Young and down, see my gold fronts
I'm throwin bands, I sign my dum
She poppin poppin poppin pussy
All the way back to the hotel
Ya'll know my slogan â€“ everything fo sale

[Hook:]
Kick Knowledge, nah young and down
Kick Knowledge, nah young and down
Kick Knowledge, nah young and down

[Verse 4:]
Young and down, I'm selling coke
I'm selling smoke, I'm selling dope
On the block you know fiends come by the dozen
You know we sell our yay from the night to the morning
Kick Knowledge, Martin Luther King
He barely slept, but he had a dream
I'm from Haiti so ya'll know I rep true celeboture
First black republic, 18-04

[Hook:]
Kick Knowledge, nah young and down
Kick Knowledge, nah young and down
Kick Knowledge, nah young and down
