Mista mista
Can I get five dollars
So I can get something to eat
HELL NO MOTHERFUCKA
You can't get no money from me
Cause everytime I give you a dollar
You go get shot up with more and more needles
And you tell me that you're drug free
Drug Free
Mista mista
I haven't ate anything for a week
Can I get a quarter?
HELL NO MOTHERFUCKA
What can a quarter get you?
Nothing motherfucka
You are just fucked up
Off them fucked up drugs
You know you need to fucking leave alone
But you keep telling me that you're drug free
MOTHERFUCKA
You ain't drug free, you're a fiend
And everytime I try to help you
You pretend as if it's okay
Then later on in the week
You go back to shootin' needles, to sniffin'
Oh mf, but you told me you were DRUG FREE
DRUG FREE
You ain't drug free motherfucka
So you damn well, can't get no motherfuckin money from me
