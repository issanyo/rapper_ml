Please man
Don't call the police man
Why can't we just be friends
And try to get along
I don't wanna hurt no one
I just wanna have a little fun
So I'm begging you please man
Don't call the police man

I didn't know the stereo was playin' so loud
I didn't know the go-go girls were dancing
It's outta sight (outta sight), it's all right (all right)
So let me get you a cold Red Stripe

Please man
Don't call the police man
Why can't we just be friends
And try to get along (we don’t like those country rappers)
I don't wanna hurt no one
I just wanna have a little fun
So I'm begging you please man
Don't call the police man

I didn’t mean to cause a scene or make anyone mad
For goodness sake, no need to hate, we were just playin’
So count to ten, do it again, you do anything you like

Please man
Don't call the police man
Why can't we just be friends
And try to get along (we don’t like those country rappers)
I don't wanna hurt no one
I just wanna have a little fun
So I'm begging you please man
Don't call the police man

[Wyclef:]
Check my country swagger, I dress in black like the late Johnny Cash
Stash more cash than Willie Nelson, why you
Undercover guys we can split the profits man
I'm a gambler like Kenny Rogers, my T-shirt says "the devil went down to
Georgia" like Charlie Daniels -- yea haw
Back in the crib I'm watchin' Reba
I hear the helicopters, police bust the door
Down, I'm in court gettin' judges by the Judds
I got acquitted 'cause they love them cowboys
Cowgirls call me Wyclef Jean
With those Big & Rich boys...

Be friends and try to get along
I don't want to hurt no one
I just wanan have a little fun
So I'm begging you please man
Don't call the police man
So I'm begging you please man
Don't call the policeman
