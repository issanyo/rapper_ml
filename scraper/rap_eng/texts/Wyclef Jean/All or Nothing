[Verse 1: Ray BLK]
God knows they told me, they really did
But I believed you, I really did
You even told me, you really did
Didn't believe you, I never did

[Pre-Chorus: Ray BLK]
'Fore you forget just who you are, yeah, are
You go ahead and tell 'em no, no, no, no
No, nah, nah, nah

[Chorus: Ray BLK]
This'll be the last time I pretend
This'll be the last time I give in
Look me in the eye when you tell your lie
This time it's a all or nothing thing
This'll be the last time I pretend
This'll be the last time I give in
Look me in the eye when you tell your lie
This time it's a all or nothing thing

[Verse 2: Ray BLK]
I shoulda showed you, I really should
What I was made of, I never would
I let you sell me the way you did
If I remembered I'm solid gold

[Pre-Chorus: Ray BLK]
'Fore you forget just who you are, yeah, are
You go ahead and tell 'em no, no, no sir
Say no, nah, nah, nah

[Chorus: Ray BLK]
This'll be the last time I pretend
This'll be the last time I give in
Look me in the eye when you tell your lie
This time it's a all or nothing thing
This'll be the last time I pretend
This'll be the last time I give in
Look me in the eye when you tell your lie
This time it's a all or nothing thing, yeah

[Bridge: Wyclef Jean & Ray BLK]
Do you try?
So our dream won't die
Now you can't justify
The guilt got me tongue-tied, oh no, no
When I say someone please call 911
That's 'cause I realised the wrong that I've done
Emergency, somebody shot my heart down
But two wrongs don't make it right
I was blind but now I see
Took an L but now I'm G
You could never be faithful but you were my religion
So I believed you when you said you were changed
You were playing me like a game
When I said I want TLC
Didn't mean somebody that creeps
Now I'm ghost and you say that ya haunted
'Cause all you think 'bout is how bad you want it

[Chorus: Ray BLK]
This'll be the last time, the last time
This'll be the last time, oh
So look me in the eye when you tell me lies
This time it's a all or nothing thing
Said, this'll be the last time, the last time
This'll be the last time, the last time
Look me in the eyes when you tell me lies
This time it's a all or nothing thing
Oh, this'll be the last time I pretend
This'll be the last time I give in
Look me in the eyes when you tell your lies
This time it's a all or nothing thing
All or nothing thing

[Outro: Ray BLK & Wyclef Jean]
Nah, nah, no, baby
She make a bad man wanna turn good, no, no
No, no, no, no, no
