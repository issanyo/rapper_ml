[Intro:]
I mean real talk, I'll play the guitar from here
'Cus my mama took the gun out my hand and replaced it with a guitar
Real talk

[Bridge:]
Coast to coast, Refugee Republic
We don't know need the movies
We be right in them records
Aye
Coast to coast, Refugee Republic
We don't know need the movies
All hands on deck, right them epics
Stay on my Jimi Hendrix

[Hook:]
Ayo I stay on my Jimi Hendrix
Ayo I stay on my Jimi Hendrix
Aye, stay on my Jimi Hendrix
Aye, stay on my Jimi Hendrix

[Verse:]
I was happy when I saw B.o.B with a guitar
Strumming that thing at the BT awards
Or Lil Wayne, picked it up, he love that rock n roll
Guitar with the trap comin – I call it trap n roll
I'm talkin Jimi Hendrix, I'm talkin Santana
I'm talkin Steve Vy, Eddie Van Halen
Prince Purple Ring – he make the guitar scream
Man the girl got the blue – BB King
You gon feel better even though you feel sad
Conversatin at dinner, we listenin to jazz
Get back in the crib, sing every Red Hot Chili Pepper song that they ever did
She in a better mood so she tell me huh
Is it true you play the guitar with your tongue? Nah
Nah, I've been playin with my teeth, right in them strings
I'm on my Jimi Hendrix, she say show me that thing

[Hook:]
Ayo I stay on my Jimi Hendrix
Ayo I stay on my Jimi Hendrix
Aye, stay on my Jimi Hendrix
Ayo I stay on my Jimi Hendrix

Aye
Aye
Aye
Aye
Ayo I stay on my Jimi Hendrix
