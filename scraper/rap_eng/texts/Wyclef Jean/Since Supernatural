[Verse 1: Governor Washington]
Since Supernatural ain't nothin' changed
All new players, still the same old game
Well if you're low-ridin' and you're up in your range
Let me see you blow your horn

For the mommies that be lookin' good at the bus stop
The ones at the club that be makin' the fires start
Your fools with the thugs that be makin' the guns spark
Why can't we all just get along?

LAPD, riots, beating
Streets on fire, the people fleeting
Someone said there's O. J. speeding
Cochran beef in that club ain't fittin'
Tyson's fight, Vegas lights
2Pac lost his life that night
And Biggie dies
And hip-hop prize
And that's when the East and the West unite
So, come on

[Chorus: Governor Washington]
Oh, baby, baby, baby, I got your back
No matter where I am, no matter where you at
When you're thinking of me
I'm dreaming of you
Oh, don't worry baby
If you can't break through
It's cause I'm on same line
Calling at the same time
Trying to ease your mind
I ain't too much of a man to say
I can't wait to get to do the supernatural to you

[Verse 2: Melkie Jean]
Since Supernatural ain't nothin' changed
Still boppin' heads on the uptown train
Playin' in the speakers while you drive in the rain
Speeding on the parkway switchin' lanes

From the underground to the tunnel bangin' your radio
MTV, BET, video
The Santana show via satellite in Mexico
VIP at the door

No more dreamin', guitars screamin'
You can make it, keep believing
But as times keep passin'
Feel my passion
I won't sell my soul for fashion
Grammy night, too much hype
Too much cars, too much ice
My man just got 25 to life
Aaliayh flies to paradise

[Chorus: Governor Washington]
Oh, baby, baby, baby, I got your back
No matter where I am, no matter where you at
When you're thinking of me
I'm dreaming of you
Oh, don't worry baby
If you can't break through
It's cause I'm on same line
Calling at the same time
Trying to ease your mind
I ain't too much of a man to say
I can't wait to get to do the supernatural to you

[Outro: Governor Washington]
If the city gets dark I'll be alright
And if the pain comes I'll be your core
If you can't breathe I'll be your rail
Just know that we will always prevail

North, South, East to the West side
Put this on the booth, it should be world wide
North, South, East to the West side
Put your hands in the air and represent your side
