Feel like we living in the last days
This a letter if I pass away
If I did you wrong I hope that you forgave me
And pray the lord that he give us grace

Kuz I don't know nothing
I only through it
Got to be something
I shouldv’e been doing
Kuz I done lost everything that I ever loved
Never thought I would question the creator above
But everybody love you is doing bad
Keep em confused, keeping em mad
Father Forgive me Father, I know not what I do
But I got some more feeling spew
I feel like I been working without benefits
I know you feeling why Im always in my feelings
Feel like I’m working and everybody get the benefits
Then again who am I kidding
Who am I praying to
If you out there you shoulda been heard me
Kuz Auntie Nise had like a million surgeries
So, When it’s time to bitch that’s who I think of
Everything could change in the blink of
I feel like we need some answers
Feel like they advertise cancer
I’m feeling so many ways
I just wish my feelings mattered
Feeling deaths the only way out the game
I just hope they remember my name 

Amazing  Grace
(Feel like we living in the last days)
(this a letter if I pass away)
How sweet the sound
(if I did you wrong I hope that you forgave me)
(and pray the lord that he give us grace)
That saved a wretch like me

Feel like we living in the last days
This a letter if I pass away
If I did you wrong I hope that you forgave me
And pray the lord that he give us grace

9 times out of 10 Imma disappoint you
Kuz I’m impatient and procrastinate
Imagine the one you love didn't really want you
And then got turned away from Heaven's gates
Most things I say come from a place of insecure
But I feel much better when I got 11s on
Im a real nigga and I hate to be ignored
Should've thought about your feelings
Before you made me cute you off
You be acting to like you need me
That is 
Until you see me  Kuz
You be going hard on the text
When we face to face its just like you forget
Damn
