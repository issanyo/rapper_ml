[Intro: J'Mika]
Thank God for the culture
Thank God for the culture
Thank God for the culture
Thank God for the culture

[Verse 1: Wyclef Jean]
Even though I walk
Through the valley of a shadow of death
I shall fear no evil
He say, what's a man to do
When I'm in the neighborhood
Where colors matter

[Chorus: Wyclef Jean]
Thank God for the culture, amen, yo
Thank God for the culture, amen, yea
If it wasn't for the culture
They probably have me doing 32 summers
Thank God

[Verse 2:Wyclef Jean]
In 1996 they had their reasonable doubt
And then we settled the score as soon as we came out
All eyes on we, I was slimming, I was killin' it
It was written that the kid would be infamous
And the beats and rhymes gave me life
Many, many, many nights they tried to get me for my ice
Ante Up! , shottas on the roof
If I hit 'um up you will catch a bullet in your Goose
Words to Mr. Wallace got the Naughtiest Nature
No intention on a Pun, but I don't want to be a playa
On the next episode tryna give you that prescription
Put your Ls up if you could see the big picture
Lets have a toast with this Jesus wine
For those that neva see the sunshine

[Chorus: Wyclef Jean]
Thank God for the culture, yea, facts
Yea, thank God for the culture, amen, right
Yea, if it wasn't for the culture
They probably have me doing 32 summers

Hands up like you're saying hi to Christ
Hello, hi, Hello, hi, Hello, hi, Hello
Thank God for the culture, amen, yo
Thank God for the culture, amen, yea
If it wasn't for the culture
They probably have me doing 32 summers
Thank God

[Bridge: Leon Lacey]
Thank God for the culture
The Jiggaman set the blueprint for us
Pioneers who paved the way and changed the game
You never seen a one-hit wonder in the hall of fame
Bad boy there's no limit to this cash money
More money, more problem, keep that fast money
You may ? or die but you know that Jesus walks be sure to testify
Cuz you guys get, anybody ??
Bring them T-Pain
Have you ever seen a giant with a little name
Lil Missy, Lil Jon, Lil Kim, and even Lil Wayne
Let's take a toast, bring out the Jesus wine
For my people that won't see the sunshine

[Chorus: Wyclef Jean, J'Mika, Leon Lacey]
Thank God for the culture, yea, facts
Yea, thank God for the culture, amen, right
Yea, if it wasn't for the culture
They probably have me doing 32 summers

Hands up like you're saying hi to Christ
Hello, hi, Hello, hi, Hello, hi, Hello
Thank God for the culture, amen, yo
Thank God for the culture
(Let's hear for the, Let's do it for the, Let's hear the)
I'm the only one Arita ever loved
I'm the son of a preacherman, yah
Thank God for the culture
