[Wyclef]
I'm just sittin' here playin' the guitar

[Claudette]
City High, Claudette and 'Clef (oooh oooh oh)

[Wyclef]
Ehh, excuse me
If you see me screamin'
Deep in my mind
I'm only dreamin'
Cuz if I wake girl
And your not by my side
I feel like half of me
Is no longer alive
So please shorty
Before you walk out that door, booby
Would you listen to my song?

[Claudette]
If only, I give you one last chance (one last chance)
Wit the devil you can no longer dance
You've got to be faithful
So we could be fruitful
Build a family
And follow God's destiny
So just before I run to the block, papi
I might listen to your song

[Wyclef]
OOH, before you walk out that door listen

[Hook: Wyclef & Claudette]
[W.J.]
They say two wrongs don't make a right
[C.O.]
Don't make it right
[W.J.]
So if I'm wrong, I ain't tryna fight
I'm tryna have some dinner wit some candlelight
[C.O.]
Yeah, yea
[W.J.]
Lay up in tha bed and make love all night
[C.O.]
So papi I won't leave, maybe I'll just stay
But promise me that you'll do the same
[W.J.]
Girl I'mma love you, like I never loved you
[C.O.]
Touch me, like you never touched me
[W.J.]
Yo, if you give me the chance girl, I'm gone show you

[Claudette]+(Wyclef)
Now baby, understand (I understand)
That I forgive you
But I ain't gone forget
That you brought me pain

[Wyclef]
Baby, baby, baby, baby
But I have grown
From a thug into a man
Built my castle with bricks
And no longer with sand
Oh girl

[Claudette]
Then just before I run to the block baby
I might listen to your song

[Wyclef]
BOO, before you walk out that door listen

That I can't see the sunshine no more
I'm so used to the pain that the
The sickness feels like the cure

And let me in, I'm gonna love you over
