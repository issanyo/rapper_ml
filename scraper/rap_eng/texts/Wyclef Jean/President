Yeah...
Election time's coming
Who you gonna vote for?
Yeah

(Chorus):
If I was president
I'd get elected on Friday
Assasinated on Saturday
Buried on Sunday
Then go back to work on Monday
If I was president
If I was president
If I was president, yeah

Instead of spending billions on the war
I can use that money
So I can feed the poor
Cuz I know some so poor
When it rains that's when dey shower
Screamin fight the power
That's when the vulture devours

(Chorus):
If I was president
I'd get elected on Friday
Assasinated on Saturday
Buried on Sunday
Then go back to work on Monday
If I was president
If I was president
If I was president, yeah

I know some soldiers
That sleep but they can't dream
Wake up with screams
Sounds of M-16's
So take this medal of honor
For your bravery
I wish you the best kid
For you and your family

(Chorus):
If I was president
I'd get elected on Friday
Assasinated on Saturday
Buried on Sunday
Then go back to work on Monday
If I was president
If I was president
If I was president

But the radio won't play this
Dey call it rebel music
How can you refuse it?
Children of Moses
Tell the children the truth, the truth
It's not all that bling that's diamonds
Tell them the truth, the truth
Most of y'all wear cubic zirconium
(Take it off now)
Tell them the truth, the truth, yeah
Your soul is worth more than diamonds and gold

(Rapped)
If I was president
All blacks would have reparation
No segregaton, feed the nation
So there's no famine
Muslims, Jews, Christians
Would hold hands every week on the beach
Party by the sand, word up
Take trips on Air Force One
Don't need to bring the homeless
With no sneeks to Air Force One
Better schools in the 'hood
Better teachers for the classes
Making money, paying no taxes
Find the best scientists
Tell 'em to come up with an answer
I want the cure for AIDS and cancer
But I gotta watch my back
Snipers on the hill with the steel
Waiting at JFKill

(Chorus)
If I was president
I'd get elected on Friday
Assasinated on Saturday
Buried on Sunday
Then go back to work on Monday
If I was president
If I was president

(Spoken)
I feel the rain coming, let me take out my guitar for them right now
Let's go

Refuguees!
