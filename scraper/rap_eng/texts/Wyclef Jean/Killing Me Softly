[Hook: Lauryn Hill]
Strumming my pain with his fingers
Singing my life with his words
Killing me softly with his song
Killing me softly with his song
Telling my whole life with his words
Killing me softly with his song

[Ad-libs: Wyclef Jean + (Lauryn Hill)]
(Ah!) Yooo! (Yeah! Yeah!)
This is Wyclef, Refugee Camp (L-Boogie up in here)
Prazrel, (Prazrel up in here! Ha! Ha!)
Lil' Base sits up there on the base (Refugees up in here)
While I'm on this... I got my girl L (Ah! Ah!)
One time, one time, (one time)
Ayo, L, you know you got the lyrics

[Verse 1: Lauryn Hill]
I heard he sang a good song
I heard he had a style
And so I came to see him
And listen for a while
And there he was
This young boy, stranger to my eyes

[Hook: Lauryn Hill + (Wyclef Jean)]
Strumming my pain with his fingers (One time, one time)
Singing my life with his words (Two times, two times)
Killing me softly with this song
Killing me softly with his song
Telling my whole life with his words
Killing me softly with his song

[Verse 2: Lauryn Hill]
I felt all flushed with fever
Embarrassed by the crowd
I felt he found my letters
Then read each one out loud
I prayed that he would finish
But he just kept right on

[Hook: Lauryn Hill + (Wyclef Jean)]
Strumming my pain with his fingers (One time, one time)
Singing my life with his words (Two times, two times)
Killing me softly with his song
Killing me softly with his song
Telling my whole life with his words
Killing me softly with his song

[Interlude: Wyclef Jean]
Yo, L-Boy, take it to the bridge

[Hook: Lauryn Hill]
Strumming my pain with his fingers
Yes he was singing my life with his words
Killing me softly with his song
Killing me softly with his song
Telling my whole life with his words
Killing me softly with his song

Strumming my pain yeah
Singing my life with his words
Killing me softly with his song
Killing me softly with his song
Telling my whole life with his words
