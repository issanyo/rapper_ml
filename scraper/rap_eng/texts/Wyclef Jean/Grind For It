Hook: [Ace]

Coming up pops told me (son always do your own thing)
Now I get attention (Like the house when the phone rings)
Because I grind for it
Give me water I'll make wine from it
Never had it too hard (But no your boy was never spoon fed)
Now it ain't gonna' stop (I slept in it and made my own bed)
Please believe Im gonna' grind for it
If you know me you know I grind for it

I know you see me out here grinding (X4)

Verse 1: [MB4]

Button-up new watch
Taylored pants due socks
Blue moc's
Two shots
Put me in your juke box
Now pour the champagne and let the goose pop
Take the party from the basement to the rooftop
Now why these rappers tryna' sound so hard
Sky-living space swag guess my sounds solnar
Got me thinking to myself "why all these clouds so large?"
Im just thinking outloud for my fans no charge
Post cards to the haters "Au revior"
Punchlines ride the whip in which my lyrics chauffeur
Im in a class of my own just like the slow kids
This the land of the fake welcome to show biz
A place where girls are getting nose jobs just to get noticed
And rappers lie about theyre own lives just to get quoted
Signing off "MB" catch me at the top
And they say time is money catch me in your watch

(Hook)

Verse 2: [Wyclef Jean]

My lifes an HBO series
Entourage, I confess me, cindy
Niki Minaj
Not the rapper, Im talking 'bout an actress
That I met in the show "El Izee" out in Paris, (yeah)
Brooklyn, call me Fabolous
You, desturbing the peace
Ludacris
Try to Kanye me for my cash
Singing "Good Life" by Mr. West
Where my 50 stacks?
Dont mistake my kindness for weakness brother
My RPG's will have you shaking dreads like Waka-Flaka
Trust me, we ain't' never scared
You ain't BMF you holding on to rick ross' beard
And when I bust ain't no holding me back
Boughatti's too slow so I just bought a corner sack
It feels good to see my stock go back up
If I run for president again Ima' get an armored truck
'Cuz every since baby dock hit the surface
Haiti been hot like a furnace
Wyclef AKA Toussaint St. Jean, When I spit
Saka Fih

(Hook)

Hey Clef they mad again
Its because when these rappers step on the courts the only time they traveling
Im in a yacht these rappers paddeling
Im MJ in the 4th
James Bond in the javelin
Excuse the flow but im going out of my mind
Purposely paiting pictures a young poet in his prime
And they Love me (yea, yea, yea, yea)
They loving my style
My style (Lets go)
I brought Clef back to rap
Threw Fred (The Godson) on a track
Get my beats from Vinny Idol
Show these youngins how to act
Im a hard guy to get along with
Get on a song with
Either way the boy's blowing up like a bong rip
So take a breath and be easy
My 16's having sex with the beat
My vocals come in 3-D
Im high Def without the TV
Beating me's like tryna' walk through hell with some sandals and a squee-gee

Good Luck! Button-up! Wyclef! Ace Whats good!?
