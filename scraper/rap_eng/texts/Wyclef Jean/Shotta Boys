[Hook: Wyclef Jean]
Shotta boys I see them talking at bar
Get your drink and spend on like a foreign car
Kevin Costner wanna play your bodyguard
(Guard the guard you keep your body heard ?)
Seen the movie Shottas I play Richie X
It ain't hard to do I know who Richie is
Richie rich boys they don't give a F

You don't wanna flex nah, you don't wanna flex
Boy you don't wanna flex nah, you don't wanna flex
Keep your muscle in your shirt boy, you don't wanna flex nah
You don't wanna flex nah, you don't wanna flex
Keep your muscle in your shirt boy, you don't wanna flex, ehh
Don't make me do it, (imma please...tell the judge that you made me do it ?)
Ehh..Don't make me do it, (imma please...tell the judge that you made me do it ?)
I don't wanna do it, I don't wanna do it
I don't wanna, I don't wanna, I don't wanna do it
Don't make me do it, I don't wanna do it
I don't wanna, I don't wanna, I don't wanna

[Verse 1: Stix]
Yea, compare me to wip cuz when you push I start
No Whitney Houston here, don't need no bodyguard
That poker face don't help don't make me pull your card
Might end up in that river, now your body hard
(Its Watts up in the place so heres a shocking fact)
(ain't never bang but) I know 40 Haitian Jacks
Keep flexing all you want them zoes got my back
I'm bout my  (paper) stix about these hun'ed stacks
Never broke, thumbing through a billy paper cuts and more
Never short, come correct don't play me like a poppy sho'
I'm in the zone tell me, tell me how much for the zone
Giv' me a deal and we on
There go my phone prrr
Shotta sequel coming home
Got a business mind like (Big Meech)
Want the south to love me like I'm Pimp C
Hey Clef, he called me off the bench man
So now I'm bring the bars like Jimmy Henchmen
