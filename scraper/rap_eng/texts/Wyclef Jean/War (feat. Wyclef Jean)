[Intro:]
Ooh ooh war
Ooh ooh war
Ooh ooh war, yeah

[Verse1: Tal]
I live with the sound of violence
And fear is a part of my skin
I try to believe in freedom
But my tears do not dry under the sun

And if you wanna try, if you wanna try
To feel one day
How it feels to cry, how it feels to cry
And pray

[Chorus]
I'm looking out the window
All I see is war, war, war
Switch on the radio
All I hear is war, war, war

But it's never too late
Ain't no reasons to wait
Lord, can you hear me now
We could build a rainbow
Just to go far, far, far

[Verse 2: Wyclef Jean]
Yeah
Only time I'm in pieces when I'm in your arms
Sheltered from the harm
When they ring alarms
Life's like a dice rollin'
You're my lucky charm
When they spin the wheel
And our number's come

Here's a message from the ravens
Every kingdom's for the takin'
If we seek higher awakin'
We can stop the Armageddon

Look into my heart
Hard to say goodbye
To the sunny days
We won't stand aside
Till the love arrive
Then we'll make our way

[Chorus]
I'm looking out the window
All I see is war, war, war
Switch on the radio
All I hear is war, war, war

But it's never too late
Ain't no reasons to wait
Lord, can you hear me now
We could build a rainbow
Just to go far, far, far

[Verse 3: Wyclef Jean & Tal]
I believe, I believe
Baby, we gon' make it through the night
(We are the paper plane, on an endless flight)
We're ready for the outcome
(One drop with the kick drum)
I wish the war get done
And the peace will come

[Chorus]
I'm looking out the window
All I see is war, war, war
Switch on the radio
All I hear is war, war, war

But it's never too late
Ain't no reasons to wait
Lord, can you hear me now
We could build a rainbow
Just to go far, far, far

[Outro: Tal & Wyclef Jean]
Ain't no reasons to wait
(Love, not weapons)
Ooh ooh woah ah, yeah
Ain't no reasons to wait
(Oh, turn on my radio)
Ooh ooh woah ah, yeah
