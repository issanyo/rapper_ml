Rolling Stones could not be here with you tonight, Led Zepplin couldn't
Be here with you tonight, but we got Wyclef Jean in the house tonight
Yo, I woke up on the other side of the bed. Tune into my rock station
And someone say hip-hoppers can't play rock and roll, huh

[Wyclef] {singing} Chorus:
I cheated on you, you cheated on me
And this is not the way that things are supposed to be
So tell me girl, is this for real or just an illusion?
I pinch myself to make sure that Wyclef ain't dreamin

[Wyclef] {singing} Verse 1:
By the time you here this song, itll be number 1 on your radioooooooooo
Youll be drivin from the beach
And your boyfriend will say turn it down real loooooow
You punch up the sun roof!
And you roll down the window, slam that pedal to the floooooooooor
Whatchin the whats wrong [?]
Shes havin a good jour [?] It said love don't let me no mooooore
(to all the girls I cheated on before)

[Wyclef] {singing} Chorus:
I cheated on you, you cheated on me
And this is not the way that things are supposed to be
So tell me girl, is this for real or just an illusion?
I pinch myself to make sure that wyclef ain't dreamin

I cheated on you, you cheated on me (To all the girls I cheated on before)
And this is not the way that things are supposed to be
So tell me girl is this for real or just an illusion?
I pinch myself to make sure that Wyclef ain't dreamin

[Wyclef] {singing} Verse 2:
I don't know much about philosophy, play though, all I rest I know [?]
All I know, when I met you, in the streets, the air wasn't so cooooooooold
Its like my whole world just changed
I'm like a ball with no chain, ground myself on the aaaaaaaaa-train
Reality struck me, how could you love me?
When you slept with another maaaaaaaaaaaaan

[Wyclef] {singing} Chorus:
I cheated on you, you cheated on me
And this is not the way that things are supposed to be
(to all the girls I cheated on before)
So tell me girl is this for real or just an illusion?
I pinch myself to make sure that Wyclef ain't dreamin

I cheated on you, you cheated on me, (To all the girls I cheated on before)
And this is not the way that things are supposed to be
So tell me girl, is this for real or just an illusion?
I pinch myself to make sure that wyclef ain't dreamin
(School is out now, school is out, nah I'm Sayin?)

[Wyclef] {singing} Verse 3:
Nah, nah, nah, nah, I had to play hooky, last friday, cause she hurt me
Nah, nah, nah, nah, I lied to my mama, last friday, cause she hurt me
Nah, nah, nah, nah, I might play hooky, this friday, if she hurts me
Nah, nah, nah, nah, you ever play hooky, on a friday, cause she hurts you?

[Wyclef] {spoken}

Good night, good night (Allright!)
