[Chorus: Moxie Raia & Wyclef Jean]
Follow me I am on your side
But we don't have much time
Momma said there's a war outside
Only the strong survive

[Verse 1: Moxie Raia]
I might be in this bed for the last time
All I really want is some peace of mind
Seems like the blind still lead in the blind
Rumours of war on the borderline
When we ask a question, no one knows
Tell me, what the hell are we fighting for?
Best friends turned to foes, test the time
Lovers turned to strangers overnight

[Pre-Chorus 1: Moxie Raia & Wyclef Jean]
Wo-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Wo-oh-oh-oh-oh
Wo-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Lovers turned to strangers overnight

[Chorus: Moxie Raia & Wyclef Jean]
Follow me I am on your side
But we don't have much time
Momma said there's a war outside
Only the strong survive

[Verse 2: Wyclef Jean]
Sipping on this drink for the last time
All I really wanted is a peace of mind
War is gonna be, gonna be
But at least I got you and you got me

[Pre-Chorus 2: Moxie Raia & Wyclef Jean]
Wo-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Wo-oh-oh-oh
Wo-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
But at least I got you and you got me

[Chorus: Moxie Raia & Wyclef Jean]
Follow me I am on your side
But we don't have much time
Momma said there's a war outside
Only the strong survive

[Bridge: Wyclef Jean & Moxie Raia]
Tell me that it's part of the plan
Why am I sinking like quicksand?
You tell me that it's part of the jam
Why is no one dancing with the band?

[Chorus: Moxie Raia & Wyclef Jean]
Follow me I am on your side
But we don't have much time
Momma said there's a war outside
Only the strong survive

[Outro: Wyclef Jean & Moxie Raia]
Follow me I am on your side
I am on your side
But we don't have much time
Oh, we don't have much time
Momma said there's a war outside
Hmm hmm hmm
Only the strong survive
Strong survive
