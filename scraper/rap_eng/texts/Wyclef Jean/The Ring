[Intro]
It's been 7 years, man. I left at the height of my career, man and I'm coming back. It's like I'm starting all over again. It don't matter what I did before, man. This the music business, man. You're only as hot as your last hit. Everybody like, "Yo, can he get another ring?"

[Hook]
100 million records, all the work I put in
All they wanna know is will I get another ring, yeah
Will I get another win
All they wanna know is will I get another ring

[Verse 1]
The smile in my face, behind my back, they hate us
But like Bernie Mac said, I ain't scared of you motherfuckers
Little Haiti to Sicily, Big Pun, he was a friend to me
Fat Joe, he called me literally, put me on a track instantly
Caribbean connection put me all the way up
What goes up must go down, so Thugga picked me up
Ay, that's what I call that street cred
Take your chance in the lobby, you gon' meet those old dreads
Chef Creole, me and Khaled go back
So far back, boy 'Shottas,' man, he had a 6 pack
And I'm back on the tribe on a quest to go harder
So hard, you gon' think I'm all 3 Carters
Why haters wanna doubt that I'm Luke with the Force
Man, they kids got The Score, screamin' too much hot sauce

[Hook]
100 million records, all the work I put in
All they wanna know is will I get another ring, yeah
Will I get another win
All they wanna know is will I get another ring

[Verse 2]
The A stand for Alpha and Omega
The B stand for Bury You, that's what I'm known to do to rappers
C stands for Chance, once you take, regard your shit
DEF, is the squad, boy, read my lips
GH, General from Haiti, make my day
I stood in my jeans, in front of that 'K'
And for me to take a L, it's gon' take MN
What's that? Mother Nature with them strong winds
And O, my Peace Productions like the Q
As in Quincy when he did that Thriller, Michael Jackson blew
And this is who we are, STU
Abbreviation for the studio, I kill it in the booth
And the V, be very careful when you watchin' shottas
The W could turn to her and that's murder for hire
By the window, like X, don't ask Y
I ain't takin' no Zs 'cause the clan's outside

[Hook]
100 million records, all the work I put in
All they wanna know is will I get another ring, yeah
Will I get another win
All they wanna know is will I get another ring

[Verse 3]
Bean me up Scottie, I'm on that antidote
That Broccoli D.R.A.M gave me got me movin' slow mo'
This big, I'm countin' my blessings like I'm Sean
See the Future with my Jimmy Hendrix shades on
Haters wanna doubt and thought that I forgot my skills
That's like I am Mike forgettin' he trained Catskills
Vic hit me on the Jag, told me he mad
Wiz Khalifa paper plane'll have you feel glad

[Hook]
100 million records, all the work I put in
All they wanna know is will I get another ring, yeah
Do I rap or will I sing?
All they wanna know is will I get another ring
Oh, I'ma get another ring
Oh, I'ma get another ring
From my mouth to God, aye
We gon' get another ring
We gon' get another ring
I'ma get another win
We gon' get another ring
