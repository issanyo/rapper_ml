[Verse 1]
Johnny went to school
He kept getting jumped
Today was the day
That he wouldn’t run
He’s a warrior
He said, He’s a warrior

Little Jimmy
Little Jimmy
Always put his work
He stand up like mad
When they threw him in the dirt
He’s a warrior
He’s a warrior

Little Susie
Little Susie
They say was moody
Dressed in black
Dressed in black
Always wore a hoodie
She’s a warrior
Ehh, She’s a warrior

[Hook]
You’re a warrior
You’re a warrior

[Verse 2]
Little Mickie
Little Mickie
Play your guitar
Tell them one day
You’ll be a ghetto superstar
You’re a warrior
You’re a warrior

Little Johnny
Little Johnny
Follow your dreams
Little Johnny
Little Johnny
You have the mean
You’re a warrior
You’re a warrior

[Hook]
You’re a warrior
You’re a warrior

You’re a warrior

[Bridge: T’Baby + Wyclef Jean]
Evry mon av to follow him dream
Evry mon av to find him queen
Evry mon av to make his way
Evry mon av to live to this way

Evry mon av to follow him dream
Evry mon av to find his queen
Every girl you gotta live this way

[Chorus]
You’re a warrior
You’re a warrior

Warrior, Warrior, like this
You’re a warrior
Warrior, Warrior, like this (2x)

You’re a warrior
