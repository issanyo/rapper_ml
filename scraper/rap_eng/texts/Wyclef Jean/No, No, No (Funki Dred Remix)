Ahh (ah)

You'll be sayin' no, no, no, no, no
When it's really yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
You'll be sayin' no, no, no, no, no
When it's really yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
You'll be sayin' no, no, no, no, no
When it's really yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
You'll be sayin' no, no, no, no, no
When it's really yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
(Why you frontin' when you know you really want it)

Boy I know you want me
I can see it in your eyes
But you keep on frontin'
Won't you say what's on your mind
’Cause each and every time you need me
You give me signs
But when I ask you what's the deal
You hold it all inside
If you wanna be with me
Ya gotta keep it real
Tell me what's going on
Tell me how you feel
Boy I know you want me
Just as much as I want you
So come and get my love
It's all here for you

[Chorus]
You'll be saying no, no, no, no, no
When it's really yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
You'll be saying no, no, no, no, no
When it's really yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
(Why you frontin' when you know you really want it)
You'll be saying no, no, no, no, no
When it's really yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
You'll be saying no, no, no, no, no
When it's really yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
(Why you frontin' when you know you really want it)

If you keep acting this way
You're gonna lose my love
I ain't got no time to play
You better hurry up
Cuz every time I come around
And crews around your way
I see ya on the corner
But you don't know what to say
When I walk up to you baby
You seem so shy
What's the problem baby
Never had a girl like I
I can see right through you
And you know you wanna be mine
So get your act together
’Cause you're running out of time

You'll be saying no, no, no, no, no
When it's really yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
You'll be saying no, no, no, no, no
When it's really yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
(Why you frontin' when you know you really want it)
You'll be saying no, no, no, no, no
When it's really yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
You'll be saying no, no, no, no, no
When it's really yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
(Why you frontin' when you know you really want it)

Every time I see you with your boys
You pretend as if you don't want me
When you get home you call me on the phone
And tell me how much you care

Yo, close your eyes, shorty
You're guarenteed to be hypnotized
By the remix that Wyclef provide
I don't care about your size
Girl shake your thighs
All I'm tryin' to do
In the ’hood is stay alive
Make a little money with Destiny's Child
Thugs hear this song, they dance they go wild
Like Texas, they movin' like
No Limit soldiers
They went from a dream to the
Young Supremes, sing it girls

You'll be saying no, no, no, no, no
When it's really yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
You'll be saying no, no, no, no, no
When it's really yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
(Why you frontin' when you know you really want it)
You'll be saying no, no, no, no, no
When it's really yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
You'll be saying no, no, no, no, no
When it's really yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
(Why you frontin' when you know you really want it)

You'll be saying no, no, no, no, no
When it's really yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
You'll be saying no, no, no, no, no
When it's really yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
(Why you frontin' when you know you really want it)
You'll be saying no, no, no, no, no
When it's really yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
You'll be saying no, no, no, no, no
When it's really yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
(Why you frontin' when you know you really want it)

You'll be saying no, no, no, no, no
When it's really yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
You'll be saying no, no, no, no, no
When it's really yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
(Why you frontin' when you know you really want it)
You'll be saying no, no, no, no, no
When it's really yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
You'll be saying no, no, no, no, no
When it's really yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
(Why you frontin' when you know you really want it)
