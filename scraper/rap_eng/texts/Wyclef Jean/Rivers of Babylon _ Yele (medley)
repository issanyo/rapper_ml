By the rivers of Babylon
There we sat down
Yeah we wept
When we remembered Zion
By the rivers of Babylon
There we sat down
Yeah we wept
When we remembered Zion
When the wicked
Carried us away in captivity
Required from us a song
Now how shall we sing the lord's song
In a strange land
When the wicked
Carried us away in captivity
Required from us a song
Now how shall we sing the lord's song
In a strange land

Let the words of our mouths
And the meditations of our hearts
Be acceptable in thy sight here tonight
Let the words of our mouths
And the meditations of our hearts
Be acceptable in thy sight here tonight
By the rivers of Babylon
There we sat down
Yeah we wept
When we remembered Zion
By the rivers of Babylon
There we sat down
Yeah we wept
When we remembered Zion

By the rivers of Babylon
There we sat down
Yeah we wept
When we remembered Zion
By the rivers of Babylon
There we sat down
Yeah we wept
When we remembered Zion
By the rivers of Babylon
There we sat down
Yeah we wept
When we remembered Zion
When we remembered Zion
