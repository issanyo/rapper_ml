[Intro:]
Mister Pay Attention
S E P
Yea
See? One thing about what we do
We pave the way
One thing fo sho
Ya'll niggas in the way

[Hook:]
Say all the real niggas feel it
Real niggas, wuddup? Wuddup?
Say all the real niggas feel it
Fake niggas sit the fuck back and listen

[Bridge:]
Say all the real niggas feel it
All the fuck niggas threaten
I'm just trappin the money, man you can't tell me nothing
Hold on, this the part when we break it down, down
Break it down
This the part when we break it down, down
Break it down
This the part when we roll it up, yea roll it up
Man right, we don't give no fuck

[Verse:]
Aye tell yo lady quit lookin
Man she so disrespectful
Yea she see I'm so special, I'm so young, black successful
I got that kush from a breakfast, with a side of OJ
I know some Detroit playas but know them niggas don't play
It's about damn time niggas peek this
Big booty, nice smile on a freak bitch
That's my weakness, niggas sneak diss
We can't tell some free mail so get air
On the low, I just chill, get my dough
Are you real? Do you know?
Who yo friend? Who yo foe?

Aye all the real niggas feel it

[Outro:]
You know who yo friend or yo foe
Man that's some real talk right there man
Jordan Blue, respect!
I see you man
That's how you feel, hah?
