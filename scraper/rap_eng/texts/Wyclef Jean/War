[Intro]
Ouh, ouh, ouh, ouh, ouh, why
Ouh, ouh, ouh, ouh, ouh, why
Yeah

[Couplet 1 - Tal]
I'd live with the sound of violence
And fear is a part of my skin
I tried to believe in freedom
But my tears do not dry under the sun
And if you wanna try, if you wanna try, to feel one day
How it feels to cry, how it feels to cry and pray

[Refrain]
I'm looking out the window
All I see is war, war, war
Switch on the radio
All I hear is war, war, war
But it's never to late
And the reasons to wait
Lord can you hear me now
[?] far, far, far

[Couplet 2 - Wyclef Jean]

When they spend a [?]
You're my lucky charm when they spend a [?]
Here's a message from the rivens
Every kingdom for the [?]

Looking to my eyes how to say good bye
To the sunny days
We won't [?]

[Refrain]
I'm looking out the window
All I see is war, war, war
Switch on the radio
All I hear is war, war, war
But it's never to late
And the reasons to wait
Lord can you hear me now
[?]the window
[?] far, far, far

[Couplet 3 - Tal & Wyclef Jean]
I believe, I believe, baby, we [?]
Ready for the outcome?
On drop with the hit-drum
I wish you [?]

[Refrain]
I'm looking out the window
All I see is war, war, war
Switch on the radio
All I hear is war, war, war
But it's never to late
And the reasons to wait
Lord can you hear me now
