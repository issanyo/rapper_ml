[Intro:]
Yo right about now, this next girl I'm about to bring to ya'll
Yo, word to my mama man
She opened up for me when she was like 12 years old
You know what I mean?
The Fugees, she opened for Fugees in Haiti dog
Real talk, we should go back to the Jarina De Marco
She sings in like 4 languages
See ya'll ya'll know me man
Refugee Republic, ya'll know it's gon be different when I come with it man
All hands on deck boy
Stay off that Instagram nigga
Just give to em

Yo soy Ogún Balenyó
Y vengo de Los Olivos
A darle la mano al enfermo
Y a levantar a los caídos

Yo soy Ogún Balenyó
Y vengo de Los Olivos
A darle la mano al enfermo
Y a levantar a los caídos

[Bridge:]
Gather wealth, keep spinning, I can feel the gravity
Tryina pull me down but it can't hold me
The world keep spinning, I can feel the gravity
Tryina pull me down but it can't hold we

[Verse 1:]
At the age of 5 got kicked out of DR
A revolution from the start
Baby girl like a doll, next stop, Montreal
Parlez vous Francais? Oui, monsieur, I do
But if you stare at me too long I'll put a wicked spell on you, you
Yeah, you know I'm it, I can see I'm on your wish list
Like the drama boy waiting for gifts on Christmas

[Chorus 1:]
Us art girls we're terrible, we're dangerous
But you can't stay away from my arroz con pollo
'cause you love my main dish

Yo soy Ogún Balenyó
You love my main dish
Y vengo de Los Olivos
He la la, he la la
A darle la mano al enfermo
You love my main dish
Y a levantar a los caídos
He la la, he la la

Yo soy Ogún Balenyó
Y vengo de Los Olivos

Us art girls we're terrible, we're dangerous
But you can't stay away from my arroz con pollo
'cause you love my main dish

[Bridge:]
Gather wealth, keep spinning, I can feel the gravity
Tryina pull me down but it can't hold me
The world keep spinning, I can feel the gravity
Tryina pull me down but it can't hold we

[Verse 2:]
I'm an exemplary combination, killer DNA formation
Mix race, pretty face, we embody all the nations
Love me, love me, love me
Tell me, tell me, tell me sailor, what can you see?
Gonna take a lot of swimmin to get to me
I'm the little pretty mermaid under the sea
Listen to me now
Yeah, I can feel it in the air
The storm's getting closer, got a tropical flair

[Chorus 2:]
Us art girls we're terrible, we're dangerous
But you can't stay away from my arroz con pollo
'cause you love my main dish

Yo soy Ogún Balenyó
You love my main dish
Y vengo de Los Olivos
He la la, he la la
A darle la mano al enfermo
You love my main dish
Y a levantar a los caídos
He la la, he la la

Yo soy Ogún Balenyó
You love my main dish
Y vengo de Los Olivos
He la la, he la la
A darle la mano al enfermo
You love my main dish
Y a levantar a los caídos
He la la, he la la

[Outro:]
Man, that was the song of Jarina De Marco
Get familiar with it, the future looks bright
