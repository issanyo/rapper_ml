[Intro: Young Thug]
I swear
Girl, I swear

[Chorus: Wyclef Jean]
And I swear
Ain't nobody breaking us up
I'ma stay with you forever, girl
And I swear
Know that you were here from the start
You ain't going nowhere
I don't care
What they wanna say about us
We gon' always be together, girl
And I swear, I swear

[Verse 1: Wyclef Jean]
Girl, you got the key to the lock
You the reason that the playboy stop
You're the reason that I'm not on the corner
Selling me marijuana
You give me a reason to live
You the reason that I never did a bid
And even if they wanna judge
You the reason that I love

[Chorus: Wyclef Jean]
And I swear
Ain't nobody breaking us up
I'ma stay with you forever, girl
And I swear
Know that you were here from the start
You ain't going nowhere
I don't care
What they wanna say about us
We gon' always be together, girl
And I swear, I swear

[Verse 2: Young Thug]
Hey, honeymoon, sprinklin' flowers over you
Stand on the couch, baby, I'm wildin' over you
Take everythin', bae, I'm a coward over you
Jewelry so wet, you need a towel over you
Take you out your mama house, baby, smile
East coast, West coast, goin' shoppin'
Change the way that you dress, Thousand Island
Let you take over, I no longer need an accountant
Lord, you really, really be wild
Private 'round the world, they can't over see us
She got water like a boat, nickname it Aaliyah
They can't see us, they can't be us, baby girl, I swear

[Chorus: Wyclef Jean & (Young Thug)]
And I swear
Ain't nobody breaking us up
I'ma stay with you forever, girl (forever)
And I swear
Know that you were here from the start
You ain't going nowhere (hey)
I don't care
What they wanna say about us
We gon' always be together, girl
And I swear, I swear (yeah)

[Bridge: Young Thug]
Gettin' top, no way ride, ride
Forth fifth homicide, ah
Skrrt, skrrt, skrrt
Ride silver, ride it, ride it, try to feel the ride, ayy
Breakfast while she lyin' in bed
And I swear
Aw baby, I swear, hey

[Outro: Wyclef Jean & (Young Thug)]
I don't care
What they say about us
We gon' be together, ayy
Konpa, mete yo sou bit la
And I swear (I swear)
[?] toujours été ensemble
And I swear (I swear)
Yo mèt fè konplo pou kraze n'
We gon' always be together, girl
I don't care (don't care)
What they wanna say about us
We gon' be together, girl
And I swear (hey)
And I swear (I swear)
(I swear, I swear)
