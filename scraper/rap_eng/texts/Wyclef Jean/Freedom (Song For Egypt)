Egypt
I gotta sing for Egypt
This one is going for Egypt
Yeah, I…

I see the youths
With the scars on their faces
These are the scars of courage
From the ancient places
I see my sisters
I see their eyes
Through the veils
It’s been two weeks
And their kids have run out of milk

[Hook]
This is not the Exodus
Tell Pharaoh
Nobody is leaving
We ain’t leaving
It’s more like a genesis
This is the beginning of freedom

[Hook]
Cairo wants freedom
The youth want their freedom
They singing revolution
And if the pyramids could talk they probably would say
نريد الحرية لمصر الآن
They want freedom
Cairo wants freedom
Egypt wants freedom
I’m talking about freedom

I see my brothers
Using the rocks for their weapons
They say the pharaoh must go
They want a peaceful solution
Yeah, I

I see the camels in the desserts
But they don’t have no riders
The people have taken over
They are the survivors
Yeah I

[Hook]
And this is not the exodus
Tell pharaoh the people ain’t leaving
We ain’t leaving
It’s more like a genesis
This is the beginning of freedom

[Hook]
Cairo wants freedom
The youth want freedom
They say a time revolution
And if the pyramids could talk they would probably say
نريد الحرية لمصر الآن
We want freedom
Egypt wants freedom
The youth want their freedom
The people want freedom

And Allah has not forgotten you
For he is grateful
Yeah, I
And the Lord will never forget you
He will grant you your freedom

I’m talking about freedom
He gave Moses his freedom
He gave Jesus his freedom
He gave Mohammed his freedom
He gonna give Egypt its freedom
