"Puerto Rico" is where she come from
She asked me do I love her that recorded song
By si si si si bunoes bonita
You wanna ever be mine stay on hip hop
But tonight where gonna reggaeton the whole club

I see you party in the streets
See my myself climbing in the
Seats the hood is like heaven now reminiscing
Them days when I thought about throwing on a towel
The night before the month was like Christmas
This kid keep hustling me sometimes I felt
Like I couldn't breath I would have to sit back
And play naive and it hurt watching my mum struggle
Trust me when you broke and hungry it's hard
To stay out of trouble it's a survival of the fittest
Whatever it took to bring money to the table
I did it even my girl lost faith in me
Left me out trapped in this negative energy
Listening deeply but I have to keep on
Moving I refuse to let this darkness, cath up to me

"Puerto Rico" is where she come from
She asked me do I love her that recorded song
By si si si bunoes bonita
You wanna ever be mine stay on hip hop
But tonight where gonna reggaton the whole club

Dowled up but it was just a distraction
Even the streets never gave us a little time to relax
Writing my rhymes to a vibe scap in the corner
Wrapped me like a cake I'm trying to be this super man
In the ghetto get this paper take this music
To a whole new level trouble found me now
I found myself in Puerto Rico spy got hot
I had to roll living with my paps
I really don't no missing my lady try not to tell it show
Her new man telling her I would probably never blow
Wanted to tell to the flow I know robbin' it stay in the zone
And move hard or go home open my eyes now
I see myself on the rock miens bonitas
Everywhere I wanna ride

"Puerto Rico" is where she come from
She asked me do I love her that recorded song
By si si si bunoes bonita
You wanna ever be mine stay on hip hop
But tonight where gonna reggaton the whole club

All you gotta do is listen
Banno yellow telia mama(yeah, yeah, yeah)
Seie tiel mama bata
Bitu weil teia sicla
Como elese wella
Si pak pak wella

I never thought I would see the day
That I will be getting money making music
So these hatters wouldn't take nothing off me
When the chicks wouldn't holla I just
Play them back all I had was a flow and a ball
Cap, watch right across the room
Thinking they will be dancing to me soon so
I'm in the game selling the streets though rapped
So hard that I'm in Puerto Rico Puerto Rico

"Puerto Rico" is where she come from
She asked me do I love her that recorded song
By si si si bunoes bonita
You wanna ever be mine stay on hip hop
But tonight where gonna reggaeton the whole club

All you gotta do is listen
She looks fine just whistle at her
See the cops coming then just miss at her
If I can't spend my weekend in a cell century
Reggaeton, reaggaeton, reggaeton (carnival style)
