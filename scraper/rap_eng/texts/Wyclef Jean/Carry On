[Intro: Wyclef Jean]
Ladies and Gents
Tune in
To the sound of Wyclef
And Emeli Sandé

[Verse 1: Emeli Sandé]
Has your heart feel in love with the sad songs
Have your feet fell in love with the edge
Is hope hanging on by a thread now
Does it feel like the angels are dead

When the darkness is too dark to handle
And the bridge won’t stop calling your name
Before you blow out any candles
Ohh, let the chorus play

[Chorus: Emeli Sandé & Wyclef Jean]
Carry on, Carry on, Carry on
(He said)
Carry on, Carry on, Carry on
Won’t be long, Won’t be long, Won’t be long
(He said)
Carry on, Carry on, Carry on

[Verse 2: Wyclef Jean]
When the angel of death blows the horn
And all earthly possesions are gone
What was once no longer belong
Love is a crown made of thorns

When the eyes of lies see naked truth
And the man of war, ask for a truce
Only then will love conquer hate’s feud
And the world will once again will be new

[Chorus: Emeli Sandé & Wyclef Jean]
Carry on, Carry on, Carry on
(She said)
Carry on, Carry on, Carry on
Won’t be long, Won’t be long, Won’t be long
(She said)
Carry on, Carry on, Carry on

Carry on, Carry on, Carry on
(He said)
Carry on, Carry on, Carry on
Won’t be long, Won’t be long, Won’t be long
(He said)
Carry on, Carry on, Carry on

[Bridge: Wyclef Jean & Emeli Sandé]
La, la la la, la la la la la
La, la la la, la la la la
Yea, keep going, keep going, keep going
Don’t you give up now
Keep going, keep going, keep going
We gon’ work it out
(We gon’ work it out, I say)
We gon’ make it out
(We gon’ make it out, here)

[Chorus: Emeli Sandé & Wyclef Jean]
Carry on, Carry on, Carry on
(He said)
Carry on, Carry on, Carry on
Won’t be long, Won’t be long, Won’t be long
(He said)
Carry on, Carry on, Carry on

Carry on, Carry on, Carry on
(He said)
Carry on, Carry on, Carry on
Won’t be long, Won’t be long, Won’t be long
(We said)
Carry on, Carry on, Carry on
