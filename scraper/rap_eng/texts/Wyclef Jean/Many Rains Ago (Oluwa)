Screaming so loud that I’m losing my voice
Them boys they grabbed my wife
Stabbed her twice took her life
Wanna know why I got this anger
Wanna know why I keep a banger
I see that man told my daddy on tracks
Train ran him over and the boys don’t even look back
I got no reason to live
They just lynched my kids
Sometimes I just wish I'd jumped ship in the Atlantic
Then I wouldn’t have to deal whit this shit
Then I’ll woke up from the nightmare dream
Roots on my TV screen
Like Martin had a dream
All his kids and harmony
Sing it loud like a symphony
If you’re free let it ring(repeats)
Sing me
That old song
From many rains ago
(repeats)
When the rain fell down
When the rain feel down
Lost your children by the sea
Take it from the land
Many years ago
Goodbye mother land
Sing me
That old song
From many rains ago
(repeats)
Let the rain fall down
Let the rain fall down
You are the chosen one
I got to go back to the motherland
I got to get back to the motherland
(repeats)
Goodbye my baby
Sing me
That old song
From many rains ago
(repeats)
Let the rain fall down
Let the rain fall down
You are the chosen one
