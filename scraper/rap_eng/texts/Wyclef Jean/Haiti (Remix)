[Verse 3: Wyclef Jean]
John Wicks, I'm in love with Haiti
Kodak Black, aye
My life started out in a small village
[?] no kidney
I had no kitchen grandma said pray to Christ
This Jesus baby belly had a bag of rice
I been through hell and back, I feel heaven left
I shook the hand of the devil it felt like lava gloves
Lookin' back I was raised in the westside story
The glory of who gone make it first to purgatory
[?] seen some masked up in the day
Turn of the lion just so they can hunt the prey
My whole man told me don't fall for the peer pressure
Before you know success, you gonna meet failure
Aye, I was freefallin'
Landed in the eagles drive
I went from [?] to American [?]

[Hook: John Wicks]
I'm a Rolling Stone would you roll along
I'm a Rolling Stone would you roll along
I'm a take a nigga to Haiti
I'm a take a nigga to Haiti
I been on the road you been sittin' home
I been on the go you been holdin' on
I'm a rock and roll would come along
Papi gained a bowl, watch me overflow
