What we gon' do right now is go back, way back
Bring in the groove

I wanna dedicate this to those who never made it
]From kindergarten to the 12th I never graduated
Yo but college wasn't for some of us
So we joined the service
I seen a kid get murdered in Nam listening to Elvis
But on the out looking in
Things stay the same
But at the same vein
Looking out the whole world's changed
So keep your head up
Don't get caught up in the fast bucks
And find your mom crying while your lying in a black tux
Trust me

We don't need no education says a young man
Sitting in class (sitting in class)
School is out 3 o'clock on the dot
He had beef with some kids and he got shot, oh Lord

Turn on the television

So take this dream and apply it to your life
Even though we know the ghetto's rough
But we got to

I turn the page
What's the news today
People getting fired, walking on a wire
Looting on the streets cause the kid's gotta eat
Oh, oh turn around and look at the hour glass
I gotta get it straight
Before it's too late
Cause I don't wanna be behind that gates

Keep your head up
(Uh keep your head up)
Cause a new day will come
(Uh-huh, uh-huh)
And look towards the sun
Even when the darkness shall come
