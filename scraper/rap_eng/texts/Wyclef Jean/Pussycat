[Verse One: Wyclef Jean]
Pussycat, lay back, take a sip of this yak
Feel me on this track
Girl let me spell out pussycat
You're the p-u-s-s-y-c-a-t
That's Clef in the drop Lex
Keep the prophylactics for safe sex
Manicure, pedicure, human hair from the Korean stores
Ghetto cats, got your back
I keep a gat for the alley cats
Sexy cat, rough cat
Doggy style on the floor mat
But make sure you wear your mitten
Or pay child support for your kitten
What's new pussycat
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa

[Repeat Hook]

[Verse Two: Wyclef Jean]
Hold up wait a minute
To all my hood kitties
Don't you pull your claws
There'll be none of that on the dance floor
For the battle cats
I got metaphors
You don't wanna test
You got sweaty paws
Which part you don't understand
Don't let it be another cat scan
Talk a ice when my shine reacts
I leave you blind wit a cataract, aiyyo
But did anybody see my bobcat, anybody
It's been three weeks and we still haven't spoken - oh no
She found some mitten inside of my glove compartment
I said it wasn't mine
She said I was one cat that was lyin
So hey kitty-kitty meet me in the city
You know dogs we always on the gritty gritty
Freaky deaky in the pretty puddy-puddy
So baby girl let me ride the pony pony
What's new pussycat
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa

[Repeat Hook x3]

[Verse Three: Wyclef Jean]
Yo where my freaky cats ready to do anything
Put the blind fold on
Girl let me feel your tongue ring, bling
Now I'mma quick cat
Before your mama get back cat
Let me hit this with the quickness
Feel my physical I'm fitness
Ay, baby turn the A/C on
It's hot up in here
The way I stroke your fur
I make you wanna pur
Up in here
Sweat's coming down your back
Like drops of rain
Say my name
Say my name, baby

[Repeat Hook]

[Outro: Wyclef Jean and singer]
To all my independent cats raisin kittens on through own their own
Oh, hold your own girl
And to all my stray kittens
I got plenty mittens
And we can get it on, yeah
All night long
All night long
All night long
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
