[Intro]
(Step, step, step up)
This is something for the radio
(Step, step, step up)
This is something for the radio
(Step, step, step up)
This is something for the radio
(Step, step, step up)

[Chorus]
Boy
No matter what we go through
You step up
I'll step up too
It don't matter what the haters say
As long as you are my boo

No matter how hard it gets
This love will have no regrets
As long as when we
Stepping on the dance floor
It's me and you

[Verse 1]
Feel the rhythm of the beat
That's my heart
Cupid shot me with an arrow

From the start
And you know that
It's your love that's got me trapped

Every time I try to leave
You bring me back
So much harder at times
I cried a river
You dried my eyes and brought me back laughter

And when I lay next to you
I want to wake up
And when I break up
It's only to make up

[Chorus]
Boy
No matter what we go through
You step up
I'll step up too
It don't matter what the haters say
As long as you are my boo

No matter how hard it gets
This love will have no regrets
As long as when we
Stepping on the dance floor
It's me and you

[Verse 2]
And if we don't step up
We'll lose our groove
So confused
Don't know which way to move

Hold my hand
And let me know that you feel me too
Look into my eyes and tell me
Baby I love you

You'll never get wet
Cause I'll be your umbrella
And we can make it through any kind of weather

If you step up
I'll step up
Boy
Cause I'm trying to be with you forever

[Chorus]
Boy
No matter what we go through
You step up
I'll step up too
It don't matter what the haters say
As long as you are my boo

No matter how hard it gets
This love will have no regrets
As long as when we
Stepping on the dance floor
It's me and you

[Bridge]
And when the symphony plays
I feel my feet
Lifting from underneath

You grab my hand
Spin me around
And right before I fall
You catch me and you say

Baby, it'll be okay
Just look into my eyes
And we will make another day

[Chorus]
Boy
No matter what we go through
You step up
I'll step up too
It don't matter what the haters say
As long as you are my boo

No matter how hard it gets
This love will have no regrets
As long as when we
Stepping on the dance floor
It's me and you

Boy
No matter what we go through
You step up
I'll step up too
It don't matter what the haters say
As long as you are my boo

No matter how hard it gets
This love will have no regrets
As long as when we
Stepping on the dance floor
It's me and you

[Bridge]
Step Up

(Step, step, step up)
This is something for the radio
(Step, step, step up)
This is something for the radio
(Step, step, step up)
This is something for the radio
(Step, step, step up)

[Chorus]
Boy
No matter what we go through
You step up
I'll step up too
It don't matter what the haters say
As long as you are my boo

No matter how hard it gets
This love will have no regrets
As long as when we
Stepping on the dance floor
It's me and you
