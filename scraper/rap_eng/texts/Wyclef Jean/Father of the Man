[Hook]
I'm the keeper of the flame
And everybody knows his name
I'm the keeper of the flame
But nobody know his pain
I'm the keeper of the flame
And everybody know his name
I'm the keeper of the flame

[Verse 1]
Deeds are fruits
Words are but leaves
It's better to do well than to say well indeed
So if you come from the rock
Please don't run from the rock
Keep your conscious clean and put the wave upon your back
A fool is filder leaves out the common stone
But every dart feels like a lion in his home
My destiny is in my own hands
Cause the child is the father of the man so

[Hook]
I'm the keeper of the flame
And everybody knows his name
I'm the keeper of the flame
But nobody know his pain
I'm the keeper of the flame
And everybody know his name
I'm the keeper of the flame

[Verse 2]
Ragga It's been a minute man let's go
I went from cavemen to slavemen
Church scream amen and then they lych men
Boy charter 911 before the world trade
I saw the world through Ray Charles shades
Tried to warn them they ain't wanna listen
Nostradamus saw the bird's now there's two thing's missing
Two sons sitting Hussein's son sitting so calm they father Saddam hung in a prison
I'll be damned if a man put a tech in my hand have me in the sand shooting at the ground man
Runner becomes the gunner and the gun will become the hunted the hunted become the hunted on America's most wanted
How does America's most wanted get apprehended
When his man turns state on his co defendant
You need a lawyer let me talk for you
You in a wheelchair blood let me walk for you
I'm a leader

[Hook]
I'm the keeper of the flame
And everybody knows his name
I'm the keeper of the flame
But nobody know his pain
I'm the keeper of the flame
And everybody know his name
I'm the keeper of the flame

[Verse 3]
Yeah yeah yeah what if Martin Luther stayed in the room never step foot in the balcony
What if they had a bullet proof car instead of a drop top for Kennedy
Malcolm did the speech [?] congregation
So when them boys come get yo hands outta pocket
Five shots of the assassins Ragga
Ain't nothing new under the sun
What if I had put blanks in Marvin Gaye's firer’s gun
What if you all knew the truth before sending your kids to war
Told ya that man ain't care about Iraq
He cared about the oil
When your thinking about how many records you gonna sell
I think about getting all my people out the cell
We put in work ya’ll ain't revolutionary cause you gotta a Che Guevara T-shirt
It's just a T-shirt
Ragga why you think I ran for president
I got 5 cribs and they said I got no residence
They tried to punk me but I was born with no fear
So I'm a run it like 10 years

[Hook]
I'm the keeper of the flame
And everybody knows his name
I'm the keeper of the flame
But nobody know his pain
I'm the keeper of the flame
And everybody know his name
I'm the keeper of the flame
