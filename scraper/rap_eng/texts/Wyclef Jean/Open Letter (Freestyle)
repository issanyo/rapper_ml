[Intro]
Action Chip told me finish that cheese first boy
Okay!
Turn up my guitar
Ladies and gentlemen
First hip-hop guitarist
Oh ya'll gonna learn
Goddamn
I found my balance again
Wyclef the general, turn up
Hip-hop guitarist, stay on my Jimi Hendrix

[Verse 1]
If Tenor Saw was here he'd say
Ticky ticky tock on my golden hen
She layin next to this gentlemen
Sometimes Glock 9, sometimes mac-10
Turn me up
Whenever she lay, she sing a sweet song
Coot coot coot, coot lay low
Hey, it's time to teach 'em bro
Hey, they got to learn bro
Real talk Jay, I was with Bill Clinton
On a Air Force One headed down to my island
I know when they boarded they wanted to keep the peace
United nations know the gangs would listen to me
Brad Pitt, Angelina Jolie brought them out to Haiti
This is before the earthquake's on your TV
Used to go to DC, see Nancy Pelosi
I spoke in front of congress fighting for my country
Once I decided that I'mma run for president
My whole life changed in a split second
Now I understand the hidden outlaw on the dollar
They never let a nigga that had a power
In the final hour I'm with Wolf Blitzer on CNN
Then felt my constitution got twisted with Sean's penn
Even my bandmate said I wasn't fit
But I can see the future, nastradamus
They took me out the race said I had no resident
But I'm so powerful I made my man a president
Lost 20 mill when I decided to run
But I'mma make it all back with my next album
Who god bless man no man can curse
Powers can it get, man I used to eat dirt

[Verse 2]
In the hood they used to call me
The baddest with a Venezuelan flow, Hugo Chavez
Anything I say know gotta make sense
Cause I be gone with the wind
Now I understand the mathematics of the one
When they say there's nothing new under the sun
Ain't no illuminati here they just tryna scare you here
Cause if we ever join forces we be nuclear
I made the labels rich now it's time to build an empire
Then I'mma retire cause even the Pope gets tired
They call me general, canons hits your walls
Two kings can't reign, one gotta fall
And that's Rom for you, that's streets for you
Everybody got a set of goons ready to get at you
And them same goons is ready to kill for you
Twelve disciples, somebody Judas
Somebody snitching, giving information
Then it's immigration, then it's deportation back on a island
This is more then a run on sentence
My raps is true life events
The general man I'm back with info
Did you know a haitian was the founder of Chicago
Jean Baptiste if you wanna Google search up a haitian on the map
All y'all do is Google earth
