[Hook: Casanova]
Niggas try and catch me in the drop
Niggas try and book me for my watch
They ain't know I had the Glock
Now everybody getting shot
Niggas try and catch me in the drop
Niggas try and book me for my watch
They ain't know I had the Glock
Now everybody getting shot
Fuck boy, don't run (Where you going?!)
Fuck boy, don't run (My watch still on me!)
Fuck boy, don't run (Where you going?!)
They ain't know I had the gun
Fuck boy, don't run
Fuck boy, don't run (Where you going?!)
Fuck boy, don't run (Get that nigga!)
They ain't know I had the gun

[Verse 1: Casanova]
You know where the Nets play
Out in Brooklyn, shooting niggas in broad day
Running off on the plug, nigga that's no way
Out in Brooklyn, getting bricks from the Oyes
Two-time comer, that
Brooklyn bring that money back
Try and catch me slipping in Lust
Left with a hundred pack
Shooters like a cornerback
Money long, I ordered that
You should never thought of that
Now you can't get your daughter back

[Hook: Casanova]
Niggas try and catch me in the drop

[Verse 2: Wyclef Jean]
Born with the Haiti crown
Then moved to the Brooklyn ground
I'm on my second win
I guess it take a zoe to bring another zoe back again
I brought y'all the 9-1-1 before the world trade
I could see the world through Ray Charles shades
Is there a Heaven for a G? 2Pac the bishop
Cause for the juice, even Duncan will get a little vicious
Last name start with a J, I'm so cold
In this cold world, I seen the best froze
When the money turn to violence, long range scopes
The empire with the power turn to gun smoke
I used to think that Hollywood was just a movie
Till the Terminator executed Tookie
But neither my people, they won't see the night
They gon step into the light with the guys
They gon hear screams, they gon have dreams
They gon see Malcolm talking to King
The runner become the gunner
The gunner become the hunter
The hunter become the hunted
On America's Most Wanted
You need a lawyer, let me talk for you
You in a wheelchair, blood, let me walk for you
Don't run

[Verse 3: Casanova]
No good morning, it's get money, you know whats up
Big timer, headliner, my money up
I see them watching, I see them plotting, just come and get me
Lord my witness, this forty will knock him off his pivot
Man down, swiper came to take his life
Pinned down, really shooting something like
I be moving militant
I don't fuck with many men
Getting to the mula
Yea, I know that shit be killing them
