Excuse me if you see me screamin'
For deep in my mind I'm only dreamin'
Cuz if I wake up and you're not by my side
I feel half of me is no longer alive (say what)

[Claudette]
If only, I give you one last chance (one last chance)
With the devil you can no longer dance (no no no)

Lay up in the bed and make love all night
So we say, easy mami say, we say EASY mami say, mi say
(Easy papi, say mi say, EASY papi)

[Wyclef]+(J.D.)
Excuse me if you see me screamin'
For deep in my mind I'm only dreamin' (what's he talkin 'bout)
Cuz I've grown from a thug to a man
Build my castle with bricks and no longer with sand girl (ok)

[Claudette]
If only, I give you one last chance (one last chance)
With the devil you can no longer dance (oo-ooh)
You've got to be faithful (faithful)
So we could be fruitful (fruitful)
Cuz all I need is, looove

In the hood you brought me hope so I neva sold coke
The only dope I sell is the track when it smoke *cough* (yea)
Then blow into the skys say L-O-V-E, (uh huh)
Why owe you, when I can give it to you now (yea)

Like "someone please call 9-1-1" (ha ha)

And if I'm wrong I ain't tryna fight (uh huh)
I'm just tryna rub that cat tonight (that's right)
I believe I believe I believe I'm right

[Hook]

[Wyclef]+(Claudette)
They say two wrongs don't make it right
So if I'm wrong, I ain't tryna fight
