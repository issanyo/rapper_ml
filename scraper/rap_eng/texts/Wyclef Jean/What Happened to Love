[Intro: Wyclef Jean]
Ladies and gentlemen
I'm just getting back from the tour
I got one thing to say, man
Guitar please
Bass man, are you with me?
How's my drummer?
Get funky on 'em

[Verse 1: Wyclef Jean]
Looka looka here, your man's right here
Celebrate tonight like New Year's
Let's cheers 'cause love's in the air
Jealous girls looking at you with the hate stare
You still got slang, you're my boogie bang bang
In the middle of the night when you do the wild thing
Baby baby love the way you ting-a-ling-a-ling
So hot, fire alarm, ring-a-ling-a-ling

[Pre-Chorus: Wyclef Jean & LunchMoney Lewis]
You never have to be alone
I swear that you're the only one
You know with me you've found your home
(Let me get a little more keyboard please)
One day girl, we'll be looking back
I'll kiss you then you'll kiss me back
You know you'll never have to ask

[Chorus: LunchMoney Lewis]
What happened to love
Girl, it's as good as it always was
What happened to love
Girl, it's as good as it always was (Let's do it)
But you gave on up it, up on it baby (Oh yeah)
But you've been feeling it, feeling it lately
What happened to love
Girl, it's as good as it always was

[Verse 2: Wyclef Jean]
They don't wanna love like this no more
They don't serenade like this no more
They don't wanna get no ring no more
All they want is a Cookie, no X, no O's
I ain't gonna put you on the 'Gram exposed
Call me mister big, we can keep it on the low
Bubble bath in the the tub and the lights get dim
My tongue speaks French when I tell you "Je t'aime"

[Pre-Chorus: Wyclef Jean & LunchMoney Lewis]
You never have to be alone
I swear that you're the only one
You know with me you've found your home
One day girl, we'll be looking back
I'll kiss you then you'll kiss me back
You know you'll never have to ask

[Chorus: LunchMoney Lewis]
What happened to love
Girl, it's as good as it always was
What happened to love
Girl, it's as good as it always was (Let's do it)
But you gave on up it, up on it baby (Oh yeah)
But you've been feeling it, feeling it lately
What happened to love
Girl, it's as good as it always was
(If you're having a good time right now, put your hands as high as I can see them)

[Bridge: Wyclef Jean]
Hands up like I stick up the place, yeah
Hands up like I stick up the place, yeah
Hands up like I stick up the place
All I do is bring that bass, let's go
Hands up like I stick up the place, yeah
Hands up like I stick up the place, yeah
Hands up like I stick up the place
All I do is bring that bass, let's go

[Pre-Chorus: Wyclef Jean & LunchMoney Lewis]
You never have to be alone
I swear that you're the only one
You know with me you've found your home
(This is for you, for you and for you girl)
One day girl, we'll be looking back
I'll kiss you then you'll kiss me back
You know you'll never have to ask

[Chorus: LunchMoney Lewis]
What happened to love
Girl, it's as good as it always was
What happened to love
Girl, it's as good as it always was (Let's do it)
But you gave on up it, up on it baby (Oh yeah)
But you've been feeling it, feeling it lately
What happened to love
Girl, it's as good as it always was

[Outro]
My guitar please
