[Chorus: Wyclef Jean]
Girl, you know I'm grindin' from the streets
And I want somebody who's just like me
I need a gangsta girl
I'm talkin bout a gangsta girl
And when the FedEx come girl, would you sign for me
And when my enemies come girl, would you ride with me
I need a gangsta girl
I'm talkin bout a gangsta girl

[Verse 1: Lil Kim]
I got your back like a Louis Vuitton knapsack
You make my pussy get wetter than a shower cap
Back shot, watch a rude gal throw it back
(Gangsta Girl) Yeah, a rude gal throw it back
Walk around naked in your boxers, baby
In that chinchilla alligator fox you gave me
Big Daddy, like your name was Kane
You so for real, baby boy, you make my candy rain
If them boys raid the crib with no warrant
I'll be the first one to put it in the toilet
Flush, right before the crib get rushed
In the bedroom, only time I do the cuffs
I'm G'd up like my Gucci
See he be chewin on my coochie
Like a fresh pack of Juicyfruit
A gangsta girl

[Chorus: Wyclef Jean]
Girl, you know I'm grindin' from the streets
And I want somebody who's just like me
I need a gangsta girl
I'm talkin bout a gangsta girl
And when the FedEx come girl, would you sign for me
And when my enemies come girl, would you ride with me
I need a gangsta girl
I'm talkin bout a gangsta girl

[Verse 2: Wyclef Jean]
My definition of my gangsta girl
She my best friend, pull me down to the very end
When she drivin, brick she hidin
Case she take it like a lawyer she fight it
Yeah, and I love those lips
When we make love girl, its hotter than the Gaza strip
Yeah, dudes are gangsta but they Disney like Aladdin
They were shakin the presence of Bin Laden, yeah
And my girl she don't fear a thing
To defend her man, she'll unload her magazine
And I don't care what none of y'all sayin
Prolly be with my girl, never worry bout her snitchin

[Chorus: Wyclef Jean]
Girl, you know I'm grindin' from the streets
And I want somebody who's just like me
I need a gangsta girl
I'm talkin bout a gangsta girl
And when the FedEx come girl, would you sign for me
And when my enemies come girl, would you ride with me
I need a gangsta girl
I'm talkin bout a gangsta girl

[Bridge: Wyclef Jean]
If my alarm go off and pray, we don't fear nothin
Cause she sees through the binoculars, with the night vision
Burglar, Up in the mansion
My girl so gangsta she don't wanna call the police station
And now the robber becomes the runner, the runner becomes the hunted
The hunted becomes the hunted on America's Most Wanted
They wanna know how I did it
My girl say she'd rather be tried by twelve, than carried by six

[Chorus: Wyclef Jean]
Girl, you know I'm grindin' from the streets
And I want somebody who's just like me
I need a gangsta girl
I'm talkin bout a gangsta girl
And when the FedEx come girl, would you sign for me
And when my enemies come girl, would you ride with me
I need a gangsta girl
I'm talkin bout a gangsta girl
This is for all the revolutionary gangstas
With a gangsta girl
Every king needs a queen
Yeah
