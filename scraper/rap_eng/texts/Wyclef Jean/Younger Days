I’m still young at heart, I play the part
I feel so good, I feel so good
When Madison Square Garden
No longer screams for me
(Now)

And the record company
Don’t send no Limos for me
(No, no)
And the young girls
They think that I’m too old

I know I'll be okay when
I think of the young days, the young days
With a mike and a guitar
I used to racket on any stage, any stage

From the hood to the suburbs in a theater near you
The big neon lights whenever we came through
People pushing through like they don’t no what to do
Bouncers screaming, "Hey, hey, hey

Ain’t no pushing to the back of the line
Don’t you know everybody’s bound to get in?
Wait your turn, ticket holders are first on the line"
But it made me feel special

When a hundred girls rushed that door
Ignored what the bouncers say
They went to the club screaming 'Tom'
It made me feel special when they say

"DJ, play this request", all right
Thinking of my younger rowdy days
I know my people say

Come rush the door, we gonna bomb rush the door
(Rush)
Come rush the door, we gonna bomb rush the door
(Rush)
Come rush the door, we gonna bomb rush the door, hey, hey, hey
(Rush)

Come rush the door, we gonna bomb rush the door
(Rush)
Come rush the door, we gonna bomb rush the door
(Rush)
Come rush the door, we gonna bomb rush the door, hey, hey, hey

When I look in your eyes that’s the only stars I see
And I go through New York with no security
And on the billboards I’m no longer number one

I know I'll be okay when
I think of the young days, the young days
With a mike and a guitar
I used to racket on any stage, any stage

From the hood to the suburbs in a theater near you
The big neon lights whenever we came through
People pushing through like they don’t no what to do
Bouncers screaming, "Hey, hey, hey

Ain’t no pushing to the back of the line
Don’t you know everybody’s bound to get in?
Wait your turn, ticket holders are first on the line"
But it made me feel special

When a hundred girls rushed that door
Ignored what the bouncers say
They went to the club screaming 'Tom'
It made me feel special when they say

"DJ, play this request", all right
Thinking of my younger rowdy days
I know my people say

Come rush the door, we gonna bomb rush the door
(Rush)
Come rush the door, we gonna bomb rush the door
(Rush)
Come rush the door, we gonna bomb rush the door, hey, hey, hey

Come rush the door, we gonna bomb rush the door
(It was young and rowdy)
Come rush the door, we gonna bomb rush the door
(Now I’m old and rowdy)
Come rush the door, we gonna bomb rush the door, hey, hey, hey
(As long as I stay rowdy, nothing's gonna be cloudy)

I know I'll be okay when
I think of the young days, the young days
With a mike and a guitar
I used to racket on any stage, any stage

From the hood to the suburbs in a theater near you
The big neon lights whenever we came through
People pushing through like they don’t no what to do
Bouncers screaming, "Hey, hey, hey

(Rush)
Come rush the door, we gonna bomb rush the door
(Rush)
Come rush the door, we gonna bomb rush the door, hey, hey, hey

Come rush the door, we gonna bomb rush the door
(Rush)
Come rush the door, we gonna bomb rush the door
(Rush)
Come rush the door, we gonna bomb rush the door, hey, hey, hey

It was good in sixty-five, it was good in sixty-six
It was good in sixty-seven, I felt I was in heaven
It still feels good after all these years
Now we’re in a new millennium
I can dig it, I still dig it, I still do it
'Cause I love it, yes, I do
