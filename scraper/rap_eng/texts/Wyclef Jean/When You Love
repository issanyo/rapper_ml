[Verse]
Close your eyes
Leave the world behind
Find a place, deep inside
Where you imagine, that love never dies
In the night
When you reach for me
In your heart
Hear my sigh
Now and forever
Will you remember?

[Chorus]
When you love
You're not alone
The one you love
Is there besides you
Never lost
Or on your own
A gentle hand
Is there to guide you

[Verse]
Like the sun
I am shining down
Through the vale
Through the clouds
When you can't see me
You must believe me

[Chorus x4]
