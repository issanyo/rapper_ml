E a good book we got so much History, History
You"re my Queen and I"m your King of Kings, King of Kings
Horse & Carriage or a Limousine, Limousine
But I know you"re tired of the same routine, same routine
So baby hold my hand, we"re gonna walk on water, yeah
So baby hold my hand, we"re gonna walk on water
She said well why do I feel like I"m drowning then

[Chorus]
Historia, this is the story of my life I ask myself where we will end up
Just remember who we are
And if tomorrows just like any other lest we find our way
Historia
O-o-sama o-o-osama
O-o-sama lest we find our way back to love
O-o-sama o-o-osama Summer don"t feel like it unless we find our way
I see her eyes to the pyramids
She got that Cleopatra swagger an I"m diggin it
She make me feel like I could conquer Rome in one night
And if I die she said well God will bring me back to life
She told me hold my hand, we"re gonna walk on water, yeah
She told me hold my hand, we"re gonna walk on water
Well why do I feel like I"m drowning then?

[Chorus]
Historia, this is the story of my life I ask myself where we will end up
Just remember who we are
And if tomorrows like any other lest we find our way
Historia
O-osama o-o-osama
O-o-sama lest we find our way back to love
O-osama o-o-osama Summer don"t feel like it unless we find our way
Man, my Nula, she came from Jeremy the city of poets
But I met her by the bus stop and I knew
She went to Vanceburg High four years before her due, yeah
Gotta have her, this kind of feels like the movie Casablanca
Now we in (Esoree), doing the Zumba
Doing the conga, can"t stop
Historia, this is the story of my life I ask myself where we will end up
Just remember who we are
And if tomorrows like any other lest we find our way
Historia
O-o-sama, o-o-osama
O-o-sama lest we find our way back to love
O-o-sama, o-o-osama Summer don"t feel like it unless we find our way
Historia
O-osama, o-o-osama
O-o-sama lest we find our way back to love
O-o-sama, o-o-osama Summer don"t feel like it unless we find our way back to love
I guess we"ll find our way back to love again
