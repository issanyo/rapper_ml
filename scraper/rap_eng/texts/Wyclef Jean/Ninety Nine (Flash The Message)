[Chorus - Jenni Fujita]
Me and my crew in a little tour show
Learned to flip the door with the money we've got
The blocks stay hot, getting knocked it's on
Till one by one, we were gone
Subway sparks after dark
Flash the message: something's out there

[Wyclef Jean]
Yo John, that was the eighties man
This is ninety-nine
It's crazy out there

[Jenni Fujita]
Flash the message: something's out there

[Wyclef Jean]
John Forté, uh-huh, uh-huh
Hey yo, John Forté

[John Forté - Verse 1]
Yo...yo...
Hustle big, hustle small
All y'all relate to it
I'm a a culture power, baby, when I run right through it
What the biz, money? You know John and what it is
But then again too many yes-men...
(Wyclef: "Yo John, they missed it.")
Hustle big, hustle small
All y'all relate to it
I'm a a culture power, baby, when I slide right through it
What the biz, money? You know John and what it is
Then again too many yes-men inside the business
We stay grungy
Risk take on streets like a bungee
Hoes get nothing from me
I'm-a die feeling hungry
Rappers too complacent
I make hits in the basement
Got all the men on top wondering where they placement
If it's real, then it's real
And it ain't no replacement
Them jealous cats who talk need to all walk adjacent
I trifold y'all all into a image my mold
So I can teach you how to walk, eat, drink, and buy gold
My shit is iz-ill
Wear three condoms out in Brazil
Brothers from the 'ville no fault at the iz-ill
Wanna have a duke? Get real! How you fiz-eel?
You couldn't stick me if you brought the chisel
What the diz-eal?
Eat four stars at every miz-eal
You kiz-ill the vibe
You just high from the twiz-ill
And sti-zill I flow riz-ill, leave you fiz-ill
And leave y'all all stuck like Jack from without the Jiz-ill
What?

[Chorus - Jenni Fujita (Wyclef's lyrics in parentheses)]
Me and my crew in a little tour show
Learned to flip the door with the money we've got
(Make the money)
The blocks stay hot, getting knocked it's on
Till one by one, we were gone
(I'm gone)
Subway sparks after dark
Flash the message: something's out there
(Suicide. It's a suicide. Parappa!)
Flash the message: something's out there

[John Forté - Verse Two]
I shoot the gift cop
Find John at the strip spot
Juggling three who all know to keep their lips locked
I don't get got
I told y'all before: it's hot
Fuck the floss
I'm the boss when I rock flip-flops
Culture hip-hop
Before I take your head you should skip bop
Or find us in your homes with the chrome and the shits cocked
What?
Hey y'all pose hard, but they rip up
I leave them enemies with their lips shut
Did what?
Yo money ease up how you cease us
You better off reefin' lighting trees up
Smoking with your mens fantasizing something swiftly
But little did you know I had the whole country with me

[BRIDGE - Wyclef Jean]
Little do you know (3x)
I got the whole country with me
Little do you know, huh?

[Repeat Chorus]
[Repeat BRIDGE]
[Repeat Chorus]
