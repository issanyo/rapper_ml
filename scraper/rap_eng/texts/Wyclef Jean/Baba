[Hook: Wyclef Jean]
And I just took my DNA test Don Dada
100% Nigerian Baba
When you gonna learner
Can't frame a earner
Came with the noose I freed myself like Nat Turner

[Verse 1: Wyclef Jean]
Sucker free purge myself from parasites
Marcus Garveyites on my Instagram Garvey likes
Rebel tone born in the middle of a cyclone
Revelation talker that’s the beast with the 10 horns

[Hook: Wyclef Jean]
And I just took my DNA test Don Dada
100% Nigerian Baba
When you gonna learner
Can't frame a earner
Came with the noose I freed myself like Nat Turner

[Verse 2: Wyclef Jean]
Though we rumble in the jungle
When we fightin dark forces
We Olympians like Ali when we lighting up the torches
Seen the projects turn haunted when I head the friends scream
Too much candy man, candy man, candy man he O.D'd
You would get tempted too if the devil came up to you
Tell you pick a boo, pick a boo here’s a crib out in Malibu
P-p-Pilot is ready to take off the rocket is ready to lunch
The farmers ready to pick up
Gorilla's ready to stick up

[Hook: Wyclef Jean]
And I just took my DNA test Don Dada
100% Nigerian Baba
When you gonna learner can't frame a earner
Came with the noose I freed myself like Nat Turner

Once upon a time in America (America)
This Jersey boy lived on Utica (Utica)
All my Zoes were down in Florida (Florida)
General like Toussaint Louverture (Louverture)
When Nancy Regan told the hood say no to drugs (no to drugs)
Aye, her hubby Ronald Regan was the plug (was the plug)
Patience is a virtue but not for consignment (nah)
You would think it's Vietnam the way they dying (yeah)
Only thing that remains is his remains (remains)
You the only nigga clean in this card game (game)
He got shot he ain't call the cops (cops)
Mystery like Alfred Hitchcock (yeah)
Boy back on the block (Ah ra ra ra)
Little John started screaming
Taking shots shots shots

[Monologue: Sejahari Amaru Saulter-Villegas]
Good morning class
Good morning class
Class, It's mourning time, good
Cuz in many hoods
What clavicle caress many hoods
Metal detectors greet us before are teachers do
Class it’s mourning time
Because blood vessels burst more than gushes do
And sweet, be the taste of survival
When peace just tastes like denial
What I mean is
Every class must begin after 12
So there won’t be any more mourning good
God wears a hood in this testament
Heaven be the hood in this testament
The first lesson is
Class, you don't need a cap and gown
To walk across the stage
All you need is a mind, a body, a pen, and a page

Ayo that’s all good but... how much you got on the weed
