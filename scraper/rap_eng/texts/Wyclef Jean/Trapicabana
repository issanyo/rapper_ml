Ehh..

[Chorus]
I ain't got no regrets
As long as I got you
We got next
We got next

I ain't got no regrets
As long as you got me
We got next
We got next

[Verse 1]
(Hatz ?) see through (shocrasy ?)
Your colors gotta go (Tomasy?)
You be taking me back to cocobana
When I hold your hips and salsa
They say opposites attract
She so papa, I be talking that (?)
Popo money on the street
She puts the money in the bag
But if I ever need anything she neva hesitate
(True)

Your guns with these roses and flowers
Counting the days and hours
When we gon' be that tower
And me and you (comosutra ?)

Clap on, clap off
Lights out, take off
You the real thing
Never been a knock off

[Pre-Chorus]
(Spanish* ?)
Dance
(Spanish* ?)
I ain't got no regrets

[Chorus]
I ain't got no regrets
As long as I got you
We got next
We got next
I ain't got no regrets
As long as you got me
We got next
We got next

[Verse 2: Riley]
Yea, ouwe
Yea you the baddest and yea you the realest
Yea I'm the flyest, you know I get litty
You stick around til you give me them digits
(I get around, I get around)
And now that I got you I fell like i'm winning
Every five days either one us tripping
Like who is that negga or who them bitches
Girl I ain't gonna play with you
You (?) thinking of running game on you
I'm addicted to you like you're a drug
I be thinking bout the things you do
See I like the way you rock your hips
(?) things you really do
And show she is crazy she all about paper (?)

[Pre-Chorus]
She making moves
(Spanish* ?)
She making moves
(Dance)
(Spanish* ?)
She making moves

[Chorus]
I ain't got no regrets
As long as I got you
We got next
We got next
I ain't got no regrets
As long as you got me
We got next
We got next (2x)
