I go by the name of Wyclef Jean
We are the refugee all-stars
We salute to soldiers around the world

Cartman: Hell, yeah!

This one's called "Bullet in your Bubblegoose"

Cartman: Mac 10!
Kyle: Cartman, this isn't Mac 10!
Cartman: Seriously! Mac 10!

Sit right back and hear a tale
Of a hustler round my way
Who used to clock around the block
From where my grandma stayed

A black BMW with rims to match
Windows bullet-proof
One night he jumped out the car
And caught a bullet in his Bubblegoose

He caught a bullet in his Bubblegoose
He caught a bullet in his Bubblegoose
You can be at a party getting loose
But you can catch a bullet in your goose

He caught a bullet in his Bubblegoose
He caught a bullet in his Bubblegoose
You can be at a party getting loose
But you can catch a bullet in your goose

Sit right back and you hear a tale
Of a young girl around my way [Cartman: Westside]
Who used to dance around the way
From where my homeboy stayed

Black BMW with rims to match
Windows Bullet-proof
One night she jumped out the car
And got a bullet in her Bubblegoose

She got a bullet in her Bubblegoose
She got a bullet in her Bubblegoose
You can be at a party getting loose
But you can catch a bullet in your goose

She got a bullet in her Bubblegoose
She got a bullet in her Bubblegoose
You can be at a party getting loose
But you can catch a bullet in your goose

Cartman: Mac 10 you guys!
Kyle: This isn't Mac 10, Cartman!
Cartman: It is Mac 10!

Cartman: Kenny! Your family's poor, Kenny! Get up, Kenny! Kenny! Your dad's an alcoholic!
Kenny: (Fuck you, Cartman!)

Cartman: Yeah, Mac 10 in the big house you guys!
Kyle: Cartman, you're ruining the song
Cartman: Fuck you guys!

She got a bullet in her Bubblegoose
She got a bullet in her Bubblegoose
You can be at a party getting loose
But you can catch a bullet in your goose

She got a bullet in her Bubblegoose
She got a bullet in her Bubblegoose
You can be at a party getting loose
But you can catch a bullet in your goose

Cartman: Bubblegoose you guys!
Kyle: Damn that's high, dude
Cartman: 'Mac 10!

This one's for the People

Cartman: Hell yeah
