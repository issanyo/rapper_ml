(Intro)
This is BMdub (Repping UK)
Dub Affiliates (Repping UK)
C Double O Peezy (Repping UK)
And Fury (Representing UK)
It's 2005
This is BMDub Records yo

(1st Verse)
You know I'll bring it to the best of them and ride against the rest of them
My rhyme skills shine bring untimely deaths to them
What gets killed is their self esteem
Ambitions as riders shattered, depleted helpless dreams
I'm so hot, I melt the scene, C-Double-O-Peezy
Introduced to the game in 93, by my nigga W-I-Z
And since then, people been influenced by me
And that's real, and I'm a real fucking N-I-G
Believe it or not, I'm soon to be cream of the crop
So to all the people who looked down on me in the past
If you suck my dick enough, I might let you kiss my ass
Yo, yo, yo, trust, The Dub just ain't what ya used to
We cruise through, Schumacher rappers, overtake and lose you
Wherever the place you choose, it's cool with me but give me 2 2's
Then watch us cruise through in Fury's new coupe
When it comes to the crunch, I'm like Lennox, you're Tyson
I got the technical skills that leave ya biting
My trials in life'll leave you frightened to live
And the rhymes and flows are blinding
Exciting, on time and literate, coherent and intricate
And when you hear it, you can tell success is imminent
And thats for sheezy, with Fureezy and Peezy
Catch us politikkin', spittin', forever smoking greenleaves
We're more like a chosen few
Sent to earth, to help change those with hopeless views
So don't refuse out of spite, they say UK hip-hop don't sell
You deny it, I'll defy it
I'm fired up and I don't give a flying fuck
I'm bout to switch up the game like I'm Tiger Woods
Cos when I grab the mic and bus
You ain't gotta ask the question; Can-I-Bus
Cos like Nas, I know I can, flow like damn
Watch me blow up and now you know my plan

Chorus
I'm taking no prisoners (This is BMDub)
Mans are getting slewed on the strength of my words
I'm taking no prisoners (Dub Affiliates)
I don't really think you're ready to take on the heavy BMDub

(2nd Verse)

I'm invading, blazing mixtapes and what not
No gazing, just chasing cheques, so heres my pot shot
Ain't got time to play up at the cop shop
Fuck that, I gotta make doe, come on chop, chop
Ya man flopped, thought he was top, but he got dropped
Coopz came through, stayed true and is top notch
True Brit, spitting true shit, I'm a nuisance
Cos everytime I drop it's an exclusive
And everytime my final line's conclusive
You can't catch me bro, cos I'm elusive
I came to spit fire, make wack rappers retire
Inspire the youth to speak the truth, I can't stand liars
Cos I'm not, I'm tryna picture you spitting
Then fitting ya clip in ya Glock
Does it sound stupid or what?
Most of these so called shottaz ain't even laid eyes on a piece of rock
I don't hate, I just like to debate on the realness of these fakes
I just wanna know what it takes, but I can't relate

Chorus
I'm taking no prisoners (This is BMDub)
Mans are getting slewed on the strength of my words
I'm taking no prisoners (Dub Affiliates)
I don't really think you're ready to take on the heavy BMDub

(3rd Verse)

BMDub, It's not hard to explain
We got the game to rap better, embedded in our brains
Stack cheddar is the plan, instead of living plain
When I'm 30, I'll retire, maybe emigrate to Spain, (but)
Money won't make me and cheddar won't change me
Cash can't convert Coopz, it just ain't me
And I don't know if it's just lately, but a lot of people seem to hate me
Or love me, but for the wrong reasons, you'll never see me beefing
I'm keeping my cool like the spring season
I'm leaving the chiefs behind, ain't got no time for fake geezers
Schemers and non believers, cheaters
Or people with ulterior motives and you know this
I'm tryna make bread like hovis
Take over this shit like locusts
We'll give you shit to deal with, you can't cope with
This neuro-lyrical hyper technique will catch your mind like hypnosis
So stay focused
Cos when I drop that deep shit, if your mind ain't right you won't notice
