Young love
Rebels in a world where no one trusts each other
Young love
All we got is us

Say we're lost in each other's eyes
Say we're gone, been hypnotized
They say we're young to be this bound

Shut the world off for a while
Make 'em think we're running wild
They're talking loud, don't hear a sound

Far from what those people say
Won't let this go to waste
We got that "once in a lifetime"
We've got that

[Chorus]
Young love
Rebels in a world where no one trusts each other
Young love
All we got is us
That's more than enough
'Cuz your love
Is greater than a thousand planets, undiscovered
Young love
Young love

I fell for you just like a child
But it's not just juvenile
Why should I explain myself?

Far from what those people say
Won't let this go to waste
We got that "once in a lifetime"
We've got that

[Chorus]
Young love
Rebels in a world where no one trusts each other
Young love
All we got is us
That's more than enough
'Cuz your love
Is greater than a thousand planets, undiscovered
Young love
Young love

We built our hopes so high
But they're gonna try to climb and break us
They don't understand what we have found
Won't let them in this place
Won't listen when they say
That we are way too young to ever feel this way
We found

[Chorus x2]
Young love
Rebels in a world where no one trusts each other
Young love
All we got is us
That's more than enough
'Cuz your love
Is greater than a thousand planets, undiscovered
Young love
Young love

Young love
Rebels in a world where no one trusts each other
Young love
All we got is us
That's more than enough
'Cuz your love
Is greater than a thousand planets, undiscovered
Young love
Young love
