[Hook]
Look in the sky
It's no bird, it's no plane, it's just you
Staring in my rear view
Telling me the things that you wan do
Listening to Sade Sweetest Taboo
Listening to Sade
Listening to Sade Sweetest Taboo

[Verse 1]
Everyday should be like New Years Eve
'Cause when the ball drop girl you de party
Fireworks written in the sky
L-O-V-E to the day I die
An emoji with the heart sign
A pint of Guinness when we unwind
Ride the wave you gon' be mine
And then we move into the 6-9

[Hook]
Look in the sky
It's no bird, it's no plane, it's just you
Staring in my rear view
Telling me the things that you wan do
Listening to Sade Sweetest Taboo
Listening to Sade
Listening to Sade Sweetest Taboo

[Verse 2]
Your body rubbed down
And your ready for de steaming
Ready for de sexual healing
Don't make me wait too long
'Cause the bad boy ready for the action
Ready for the action now, big dog
Ready for the kitty with the meow
Ready for the here and the now
Ready for the Queen to be crowned

[Hook]
Look in the sky
It's no bird, it's no plane, it's just you
Staring in my rear view
Telling me the things that you wan do
Listening to Sade Sweetest Taboo
Listening to Sade
Listening to Sade Sweetest Taboo
Aww, Listening to Sade

[Verse 3]
Body long like you laying on a stretcher
No pain when papi apply pressure
Mini many position like Kama Sutra
Like a virgin you can be my Madonna
She's not my computer, no
She so real, I can feel
It's automatic, when she take the wheel
Aw baby, awh baby, awh baby

[Hook]
Look in the sky
It's no bird, it's no plane, it's just you
Staring in my rear view
Telling me the things that you wan do
Listening to Sade Sweetest Taboo
Aww, Listening to Sade
Aww, Listening to Sade Sweetest Taboo
Aww, Listening to Sade
Aww, Listening to Sade Sweetest Taboo

[Outro]
