[Intro:]
There's been a whole lot of superstars on the stage tonight
But when Wyclef and Waka Flocka get together
Put that electric guitar against that trap music
We call it trap n roll baby

[X4:]
Wyclef, what's that sound?
Waka Flocka coming down
With flags in, blowin clouds
(And you know it's super loud)

You you you you you know

[Bridge:]
What the fuck?
What the fuck?
What the fuck?
Trap n roll
What the fuck?
What the fuck?
What the fuck?
You you you you you know
What the fuck?
What the fuck?
What the fuck?
Trap n roll
What the fuck?
What the fuck?
What the fuck?
Go ahead, bring em out

[Hook:]
Trap n roll, we gonna hit you with this trap n roll
That's when we basin, we go rock n roll
That ain't the way to make em lose control
Here we go, I'm talkin trap n roll
Get them girls all on the floor
Act a fool, gon act a fool
Act a fool, gon act a fool
Act a fool, gon act a fool
We can do a rockin beat
Act a fool, act a fool

[Verse 1]
When I came to America â€“ under pressure
Teenage shoplifter, came up, started things
8 balls, dope fiend
Like bone thugs I'm checkin em out
You know it's the 1st of the month
And they know I'm with it
Cause they talk about it in the club
Man in the mirror, air guitar
One dream, ghetto superstar
But they never had a plan that could take me up
I'm a MacGyver, I'm the nuisance, bitch them out
Yup, chosen in the rule
Dark side of the moon, came into the light
So let's toast tonight, glasses up
As you fill them right, it turn up my guitar

My guitar, my guitar
My guitar, my guitar
My guitar, my guitar
Wait a minute now

[Hook:]
Trap n roll, we gonna hit you with this trap n roll
That's when we basin, we go rock n roll
That ain't the way to make em lose control
Here we go, I'm talkin trap n roll
Get them girls all on the floor
Act a fool, gon act a fool
Act a fool, gon act a fool
Act a fool, gon act a fool
We can do a rockin beat
Act a fool, act a fool

[Verse 2]
To the what down my block
With teen niggas sellin crack rocks
So they sold the trap spots
Dodged a pin and I get shot
Outraged, I'm caller, talk to cops
Stick together like dread locks
Keep the doors up
Waka Flocka, that's hip-hop
I'm up here and make a phone in the m box
My mama base but I ain't have a boat
If I ain't have a name just splittin pain
Shut the fuck up, we're number one on every track
Under that track, on the pop truck
Talkin number one, call clip the rock
My vocals green, make a forest dream
As I shoot plains in H dream
I got away, my enemies
Welcome to stat, you ain't Raekwon
Told me king push it, boy go hard
Busta Rhymes told me keep runnin
This gon pay off, I keep grindin
Even in the dark I'm still shinin
Gangsta and it's God plan
Then I call a fiend for losing hand

[Hook:]
Trap n roll, we gonna hit you with this trap n roll
That's when we basin, we go rock n roll
That ain't the way to make em lose control
Here we go, I'm talkin trap n roll
Get them girls all on the floor
Act a fool, gon act a fool
Act a fool, gon act a fool
Act a fool, gon act a fool
We can do a rockin beat
Act a fool, act a fool

[X4:]
Act a fool, act a fool
Act a fool, trap n roll
Act a fool, act a fool
Act a fool, you you you know
