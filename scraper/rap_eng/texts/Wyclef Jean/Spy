[Verse 1: Shakira]
Slow motion, blinds are see through
Let your mind go, imagine that I kiss you
Turn off the lights and open up your eyes now
You can take a glimpse into my soul for tonight

[Pre-Chorus: Shakira & (Wyclef Jean)]
(Do you got the heat off, girl?) Yes, I do
(Can you turn up the temperature?) You bet I could
(Colombian with a swagger) Yes, I am
Whatever it takes to make this thing work, we're gonna
Whatever it takes to make this thing work, we're gonna

[Chorus: Shakira]
There's a spy by my window
I know it's you
You like to keep an eye on me
I know you like to keep an eye on me
There's a spy by my window
I know it's you
Won't you like to keep an eye on me?
I know you like to keep an eye on me
Keep an eye on me
But if you want it, got to let it be

[Verse 2: Shakira]
I know you dream about me
And it turns me on to think about it
This is the finest game
It ain't even got a name
I just wanna see how far it takes us tonight

[Pre-Chorus: Shakira & (Wyclef Jean)]
(Do you got the heat off, girl?) Yes, I do
(Can you turn up the temperature?) You bet I could
(Colombian with a swagger) Yes, I am
Whatever it takes to make this thing work, we're gonna
Whatever it takes to make this thing work, we're gonna
Whatever it takes to make this thing work, we're gonna

[Chorus: Shakira]
There's a spy by my window
I know it's you
You like to keep an eye on me
I know you like to keep an eye on me
There's a spy by my window
I know it's you (It's me)
Won't you like to keep an eye on me?
I know you like to keep an eye on me
Keep an eye on me
But if you want it got to let it be

[Bridge: Wyclef Jean]
When the dog's away, that's when the cat's play
You'll be my girl, I'll be the spy
Like the James Bond flick, girl, I'm ready to ride
When the cat's away that's when the mouse play
You'll be my girl, I'll be the spy
Like the James Bond flick, girl, I'm ready to die, die die

[Chorus: Shakira]
There's a spy by my window
I know it's you
You like to keep an eye on me
I know you like to keep an eye on me
There's a spy by my window
I know it's you
Won't you like to keep an eye on me?
I know you like to keep an eye on me
Keep an eye on me
But if you want it got to let it be

[Outro: Shakira]
Lipstick's on, stockings up
Skirt's short, heels are high
Take your time, buckle up
Close your eyes and enjoy the ride
Close your eyes and enjoy the ride
Close your eyes
Close your eyes and enjoy the ride
