[Intro:]
Yalready know what it is man
Yo, I gotta leave ya'll with some 90's hiph-hop
I mean this kid right here, he influences 90's hip-hop man, you know?
But he only like 20 some, you know what I mean?
I don't know how you get in em like that
So right now we gonna get it some of our men
This kid got mad vibes man
Go by the name of Skiff, you know what I mean
Classic hip-hop
Ya'll know what it is man, April Shower
Hope you enjoyed the tape, look out for the album
Yo Sydec, what the album called again?
The Carnival Begins
Como you hear a lot about it, no?
The Carnival Begins
Yo, what's the name of the album?
The Carnival Begins

Ladies and gents, change in talk yea
The abyss scary, alright

Dressed like I'm headed to a yacht club social
Fresh, fresh, fresh to death
Dressed like I'm headed to a yacht club social
Fresh, fresh, fresh to death

[Verse 1:]
Hanging out with tax evaders, white collar criminals
Chemist dudes, making money off illegal chemicals
Welcome to my yacht club, naked women, hot tubs
Come and get your membership
Remember just to pop up
Bomberdering with members of parliament while I'm partying no arguing
The hardest regardless whenever harboring
Hanging out with socialist, smoking over some poker chips
Motor boats and tits, frozen wrists, get a load of this, fantastic
I'm back in the building to bag shit
White on white like the Utah jazz in practice
I'm taking shots on Dodge, you hang with cops on blocks
I got women on top on women, talking bout your bop

[Hook: x2]
Wish life was like a yacht club
Every woman I'm getting, how can you stop us
We got judges on budget, not getting locked up
We don't wanna work a 9 to 5

[Verse 2:]
Mister Enthusiastic, I keep a doobie wrapped with
Hit boobie traps to a cutie's ass, when I move in traffic
New is the fabric, I've been established, truly the baddest
Designer issues, my women coming with Louie baggage
With politicians, their mission is product driven
Man giving the situation, the bacon the prolly given
If they lot are wearing daughtersmy target's near open waters
Overall into parlor, but ballin so they applaud us
Sippin on foreign lagers, harvested at a mugging
Don't park it, you gotta jock it, the carpet matches my watch
I'm a star on the yacht, that's a motherfuckin spaceship
Wasted, double deck better let the pain drip
I'm rockin sandals when it's hot, it's the land of sinnin hammocks when others panic
But damn that I've been managing
Fresh, fresh, fresh to death

[Hook: x2]
Wish life was like a yacht club
Every woman I'm getting, how can you stop us
We got judges on budget, not getting locked up
We don't wanna work a 9 to 5

[Verse 3:]
Up in some turbulence, they well cultivated the courteous
The verdict is suburban and urban persons are both conferment
I'm furnace in this bitch, now just picture me turning it, permanent
How many people wanna ride tonight?
Talking big bucks bitch, like the sender from Milwaukee
Barclay's, when they putting liquor in my coffee
Drinkin sake, playin batchi, back and a little bit of hockey
Cocaine with some Jose Cuevo, careful what you don't say copy
Your chick to the video anthem, my shit that's real live action
Buy ships, no projects, my process is taking over rapid
Open bar you could buy yourself, go ahead, there by yourself
Making hots for the higher self
I'm cycled up, for harness you can't buy the belt
Policies, no apologies, all commodities are covered
Don't gotta fee quite possibly, I'm leaving with your girl
I know, I know, they hate the way you down
I don't even own a ship, I got waiters all around

[Hook: x2]
Wish life was like a yacht club
Every woman I'm getting, how can you stop us
We got judges on budget, not getting locked up
We don't wanna work a 9 to 5
