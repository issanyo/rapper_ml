[Verse 1]
Everybody wants a mansion and a yacht
Billboard charts, they want that number one spot
Even if it means a rapper gon' get shot
True industry story!
Everybody wants to be a superstar
To be a superstar, I've seen her turn porn star
Pull up in that car, everyone yelling out, "Star!"
True Hollywood story
Gotta live in the glory!

[Hook]
Bob told you 'bout the Exodus
I come to tell you about the Genesis;
In the beginning of time God created man in his own image
Ay!
You see, man done lost their mind
They going wi-i-ild!
Oh, them girls done lost their mind
Girls gone wi-i-ild!

[Verse 2]
Everybody wants to be a kingpin
Standing on that block, slinging for the kingpin
Soon as you get knocked, you snitching on the kingpin
True hood ghetto story
No honor, no glory!
Everybody say they had safe sex
But don't nobody wanna go and take the test
Some take the test, then they come back stressed
True hood classic story, but it protects your glory!

[Hook]
Bob told you 'bout the Exodus
I come to tell you about the Genesis;
In the beginning of time God created man in his own image
Ay!
You see, man done lost their mind
They going wi-i-ild!
Oh, them girls done lost their mind
Girls gone wi-i-ild!

[Bridge]
I don't want to live, I don't want to die
I've been lying to myself so long I
Starting believing it, started agreeing with
Illusions, it's so confusing
Nothing's worse than wasting, wasting your gift
It kills the spirit (Thank God!)

[Hook]
Bob told you 'bout the Exodus
I come to tell you about the Genesis;
In the beginning of time God created man in his own image
Ay!
You see, man done lost their mind
They going wi-i-ild!
Oh, them girls done lost their mind
Girls gone wi-i-ild!
