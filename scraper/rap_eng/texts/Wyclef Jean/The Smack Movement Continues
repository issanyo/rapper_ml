[Intro:]
Yea, real nigga talk
Ain't just a motherfuckin phrase
It's a motherfuckin lifestyle
Smmmddddaackk!

[Bridge: Wyclef Jean]
If you got your firearms in your hands
Put your gun 'pon safety
Fight, everybody came to fight
Everybody came to fight, everybody came to fo fo fo fo fight
If you got your firearms in your hands
Put your gun 'pon safey
Fight, everybody came to fight
Everybody came to fight, put your gun 'pon safety

[Verse 1: Murda Mook]
I'm a Harlem nigga, blood line AZ, Al Porter
Niggas can't fuck with me like the massa daughter
I hit the strip, all the fiends know my name
I have the old school coke, I call it Novocain
You be Uncle Fester, light on your brain
And I'm Morticia the way a nigga hold a thing
I could have them fancy cars and them two's on
I rather have my fucking crown made out of thorns
Crucify me to God, you can try me
Come back three days later thinking they moved the body
Took my spirit form, them boys ignored him
They didn't head the warning, now the wrath pouring on 'em
I do this for my niggas sitting on them corners
Can't get a job, felonies forever haunt them
Niggas talk warring, kicking down your door in
Till them joints draw 'em and then they all turn Mormon

[Hook: Wyclef Jean]
If you got your firearms in your hands
Put your gun 'pon safety
Fight, everybody came to fight
Everybody came to fight, everybody came to fo fo fo fo fight

[Verse 2: Loaded Lux]
The nickel-less, broke niggas used to a little bit
Ignorant to the dollar
Piggy back, let you follow, mama slipped in the paint
