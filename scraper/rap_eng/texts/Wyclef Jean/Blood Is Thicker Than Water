(Italian speaking)

[Wyclef:]
Yo, I'm rollin with the wise guys
You don't wanna testify
I thought it was a movie till they paid me off in jury duty
I can't front the check came in handy
Cuz my baby mother stressin me like Edith did ARCHIE
They welcomed me in the family
Bought me a Porsche and a crib out in JERSEY
I told my moms she wasn't thrilled
She told me they like mad lions son they shoot to KILL
And leave yer body on the hill
Massacre similar to what happened in Amityville
I'm sittin back with a fifth
Reminiscing on who I miss
Slidin the family stone in the cd disc

Chorus-[The Product G&B]
It's a family affair (X4)

[G&B member 1]
Blood is thicker than water
The fans got me under pressure
They say I might not see sunlight again
Unless I snitch on my mans
But I won't none dat oh no

(Chorus)

[G&B member 1]
They want me to go undercover
They want me to wear a wire too
It'll neva happen
Cuz I can't see
Me goin' agianst my family tree
It's a family affair

(Chorus)

[G&B member 1]
By the time you get this letter
I won't be enduring good health, ma
I never meant to hurt you
I never meant to do you wrong

[G&B member 2]
I know you raised me
In the ways of rightesnous
And this is gonna be the last time I do a bit

[Wyclef]
I WANT OUT NOW
He laughed and said, "Please hee hee
You can check out but you can't leave
I'll cut you up in so many pieces 'Clef
That even if I sent your mom the instruction
She couldn't put you back together"
?4-5 ways to be circumsized?
Times stand still when the murders on the rise
Any last words
Give my regard to Tony Soprano

(Chorus X2)
