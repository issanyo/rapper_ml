[Interlude]
Yo yo, this Wyclef, alongside DJ Skribble (for the ladies)
Yo Skribble, I have one question
Could you please answer this for me?
I gotta know this yo
What makes a DJ "fresh"?
What makes an MC "fresh"?
What makes the ReFugees "fresh"?
Why are kids getting jealous?
'Cause we F-R-E-S-H
Fresh, fresh, fresh, that's, fresh
F-R-E-S-H
Fresh, fresh, fresh, that's, fresh
Ayo, player, with the dibble and the dabble
You wanna battle who? Wyclef or DJ Skribble
Hold the stickup it's a freestyle session
Skribble, where you from man? "Long Island"
Well I'm from Haiti, then Brooklyn, then Jersey
With a universal tag, plus I got "money in the bag"
You slept on this musician, plus the hip-hop art
Bring your best MC's, "What?"
Cause every man got disciples if you ever want a rival
Show up, with a mic, and a rifle
Wyclef stuck the bank at mid-day
And took all of Sony money, in a black van he got away
I just got a call from Tommy Mottola
He said forget about it "oh my word"
So I held John Ingrassia, at gunpoint
He's shook, callin' Donny Ienner, while smokin' a joint
I said, 'Who's the informer?' They say, 'Michael Mauldin'
I had to take him out "Three the hard way!"
The moral of this story don't blame the record company
If your record ain't selling you lack creativity
But what you want me to say? What what you want me to say huh?
Yo I've been trying to get a deal for, years and it ain't
What you want me to say?
Hehehehehehe
Ju-ju-just shut up
Bite it
And I'll kill anyone, who dares to go against me
