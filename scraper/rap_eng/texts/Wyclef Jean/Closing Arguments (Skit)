Judge: In closing, ladies and gentlemen of the jury, I'm not gonna sit here and bore you with a long, drawn-out story or excuse, of why I think Wyclef is guilty. I'm gonna stand by the exhibits as well as the tapes and songs such as Jeapordy, Til Novemeber, All the Girl And Bubblegoose, which stand side by side with my allegations. I rest my case
Lawyer: Okay, uh, ladies, and gentlemen, of the jury, as you can see nithin' has been proven here today. These witnesses dey brought here don't not have evidence to incriminate my client eh? If he's not guilty, he's innocent If he's not detrimental to the society therefore he positive! As I say before, this case is pure bishop
