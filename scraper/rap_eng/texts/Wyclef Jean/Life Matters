[Intro]
Your life matters
His life matters
Her life matters
And black life matters

[Verse 1]
Police life matters
The judge life matters
If human rights matter
Then black lives matter

[Hook]
We need to go back to the truth
Only love can take us back
We need to go back to the truth
Only love can take us back

[Verse 2]
Harambe life matters
The earth, yes, matters
The universe is shattered
If we all didn't matter

[Verse 3]
The kids' life matters
Fallen soldiers matter
If human rights matter
Then a black life matters

[Hook]
We need to go back to the truth
Only love can take us back
We need to go back to the truth
Only love can take us back

[Bridge]
La la la la la la
La la la la la la
La la la la la la
La la la la la la
La la la la la la
La la la la la la
La la (all we need is love) la la la la
La la la la la la (all we need is, all we need is love)

[Outro]
Your life matters
His life matters
Her life matters
Then black life matters
