[Intro:]
Wyclef, long side, Opium Black, aye!
Caribbean connection
Listen Black!

[Hook:]
I tried to warn him, 20 grand
And now they offed him
He down in Miami, sleeping with the dolphins
We tried to warn him
I think he crazy, boy
Must've had a death wish
I really dig, man
You must've had a death wish
If you're gonna test Opium Black
I really think you must've had a death wish
Talk to them, Black

[Verse:]
To the slums I pull press, my pink's on 6
Fresh in a boatload to risk them bricks
Banana bro, banana clip
I hope you make afloat the way jumping ship
Need an antidote, I talk poisonous
This shit I smoke is the noisiest
Red light, green light, ma, you say what it would be like
This from street lights niggas that put in work
Millionaires, that Korean dirt
Coffin, clothes, feed the trash, fear empire, feed your thirst
I mean that, top of the life
You don't know about what your running at the O's boy must you hate that
Wild for tonight, time to run for your life
Well, you're dead, can't give me no feedback
Big ole chopper, big ole timber, shut up copper
Robocop informer, tell em oh me, I smoke marijuana
Middle finger to the test, fuck you honor
Never drive by may I walk up on you
Monkey, banana, clip, drama
Arrange for me to go down, work hard
Wait for me to go down, trust nothing
Slick women took ya down, get money
Eat with me, nigga down
You in a fish bowl, I'm in a shark tank
When you're this cold you give God thanks
You in bitch mode, we all rank, you bait

I really think you must've had a death wish
