(feat. Buju Banton & T-Vice)

Imma take u to a place
Where the trouble's im the base
Where everybody's fine
And ther's no color line
The only thing we see
Is the party by the sea
So lets call the refugee

Vole, Vole, Vole, Vole
Pompe, Pompe, Pompe, Pompe
Sote, Sote, Sote
Mete main nou anle. Met main nou anle (2 x's)

If u come from the Caribians
Lets show them how we do it
Throw your flagz in the air and wave it
Ladies while you shake it break it (2 x's)
