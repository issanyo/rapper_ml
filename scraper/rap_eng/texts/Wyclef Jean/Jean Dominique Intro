Excerpt from Jean Dominique interview

[Jean Dominique] (Interviwer)
I was 4… 4 years old when the Marine left Haiti
The US Marine left Haiti
I was a kid
And every time a Marine battalion passed in front of the house, my father took my hand and said: "Don't look at them. Don't look at them."
And every May 18th…
(Which is that?)
The flag day
Defiantly he put the Haitian flag in front of the house
And I said: "Father what is that? What does that mean for you?"
He said: "That means that you are Haitian. That means that my great-grandfather FOUGHT at Vertières. NEVER forget that!. You are Haitian! You are from this land. You are not French! You are not British! You are not American! You are Haitian!"
