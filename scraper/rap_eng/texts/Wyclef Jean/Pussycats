Where my ladies at
Where the fellas at
Now where the dogs at
Where the cats at
Pussycats
(Yeah all the ladies)
Keep it tight
(Say what?)
Even if they bark all night
(Now lemme see y'all wave your hands from side to side)
With a knick knack patty wack
Don't give a dog a bone
'Cause if he hit it
You gonna be all alone
Momma, you should've seen what he done to me
I said "Momma
I should've took your advice"
'Cause Palo was a woman's thorn
Wherever he laid his hat was his home
Stay away from those hot boys
'Cause I don't want you to get burned
Pussycats
(Shut 'em down, shut 'em down)
Keep it tight
(No matter what they do)
Even if they bark all night
(All night, all night)
With a knick-knack patty wack
Don't give a dog a bone
'Cause if he hit it
You gonna be all alone
Pussycats
(Said shut 'em down, keep it closed)
Keep it tight
(No matter what they may do)
Even if they bark all night
(All night, all night)
With a knick-knack patty wack
Don't give a dog a bone
'Cause if he hit it
You gonna be all alone
Girlfriend
Innocent woman on the streets
Fed into seduction
After wanting the street poetry
Like a virgin touched for the very first time
She got open unaware of the seven signs
She fell victim to the darker side
But I'm here to tell you why
Said pussycats
(Said shut 'em down, shut 'em down)
Keep it tight
(They can say whatever they want to)
Even if they bark all night
(All night, all night)
With a knick-knack patty wack
Don't give a dog a bone
'Cause if he hit it
You gonna be all alone
Pussycats
(Pussycats, pussycats)
Keep it tight
(All y'all keep it tight, keep it tight)
Even if they bark all night
(All night, all night)
With a knick-knack patty wack
Don't give a dog a bone
'Cause if he hit it
You gonna be all alone
The fellas, the ladies uh
The dogs uh, my cats uh
No matter what they do
No matter what they say
No matter how hot they are
Don't let them play
No matter what they do
No matter what they say
Don't let 'em in girls
No no way
No matter what they do
No matter what they say
No matter how hot they are
Don't let them play
No matter what they do
No matter what they say
Don't let 'em in girls
No no way
Pussycats
