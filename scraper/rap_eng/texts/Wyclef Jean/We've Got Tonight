I know it's late
I know you're weary
I know your plans
Don't include me

Still here we are
Both of us lonely
Longing for shelter
From all that we see

Why should we worry
No one will care girl
Look at the stars
So far away

We've got tonight
Who needs tomorrow?
We've got tonight babe
Why don't you stay?

Deep in my soul
I've been so lonely
All of my hopes
Fading away

I've longed for love
Like everyone else does
I know I'll keep searching
Even after today

So there it is girl
I've said it all now
And here we are babe
What do you say?

We've got tonight
Who needs tomorrow?
We've got tonight babe
Why don't you stay?

I know it's late
I know you're weary
I know your plans
Fon't include me

Still here we are
Both of us lonely
Both of us lonely

We've got tonight
Who needs tomorrow?
Let's make it last
Let's find a way

Turn out the light
Come take my hand now
We've got tonight babe
Why don't you stay?

Why don't you stay?
