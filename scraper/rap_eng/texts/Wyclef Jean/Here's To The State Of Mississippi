Here's to the state of Mississippi
For underneath her borders the devil draws no lines
The devil draws no line, if you drag her muddy river
Nameless bodies you will find, you will find

Whoa, the fat trees of the forest
Have hid a thousand crimes, a thousand crimes
The calendar is lyin'
When it reads the present time, the present time

Whoa, here's to the land
You've torn out the heart of, the heart of
Mississippi find yourself another country
To be part of, to be part of, yeah

Here's to the state of Mississippi
Whoa, and here's to the state of Mississippi

Here's to the people of Mississippi
Who say the folks up north they just don't understand
They just don't understand and they tremble in their shadows
At the thunder of the Klan, at the thunder of the Klan

The sweating of their souls
Can't wash the blood from their hands, from their hands
They smile and shrug their shoulders
At the murder of a man, at the murder of a man

Oh, here's to the land you've torn out the heart of
Mississippi find yourself another country to be part of, to be part of
Here's to the state of Mississippi
Whoa, and here's to the state of Mississippi

And here's to the cops of Mississippi
They're chewing their tobacco
As they lock the prison door, they lock prison door
Their bellies bounce inside them when they knock you on the floor

They take, no they don't like taking prisoners
In their private little war, in their prive little war
Behind their broken bades they're murderers
They're murderers, they're murderers, they're murderers

Oh, here's to the land you've torn out the heart of
Mississippi find yourself another country to be part of, to be part of
Here's to the state of Mississippi
Whoa, and here's to the state of Mississippi
So here's to the state of Mississippi
