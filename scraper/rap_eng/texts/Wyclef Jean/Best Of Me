Won't cross an ocean
If you won't cross a pond
Won't move a mountain
If you won't move a rock
Won't waste my weeks
When you don't give me the time of day (hey)
You pull me down
You think it's hard to walk away
I always say

[Chorus]
If you can't handle me at my worst
I'll keep the best of me
If you ain't tryin' to put me first
I'll keep the best of me

You think I'm this (mhmm)
Maybe I'm that
You never thought you would miss something
That you always had
You're tryin' now to throw it back to yesterday (mhmm)
You lost me now
You thought I couldn't walk away

[Chorus]
If you can't handle me at my worst
I'll keep the best of me
If you ain't tryin' to put me first
I'll keep the best of me

Don't got lots of friends
(Just the ones that matter)
You ain't one of them
(That I know for sure)
You just condescend
Lots of people, yeah they make mistakes
But I know that this runs deeper

[Chorus]
