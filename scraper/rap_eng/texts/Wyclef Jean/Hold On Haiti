Why you wanna shoot up your school today
Why you wanna shoot up your school today
Think about it, think about it
Think about it, think about it
Think about it, think about it
Think about it, think about it
Hold on, be strong
No matter what you're goin' through
You know it's gon' be okay, okay, today
Even when the earth quakes
Like I said on BET, from the hood to the projects to the mansion
So you got no excuse
Stop blaming the recession
Go harder for Haiti
Send a text on your phone, Y E L E, 5 0 1 5 0 1
Every block, every school, dream initiation
So build the world make it a better place
Like Michael Jackson we don? t wanna see another 9-11 happen
Wish I had talked to them teenagers, with them rpg's
Goin' way head on with the navy seals
I would've told them theres a better way
Hold on,(ain't gotta be that way) be strong
No matter what you? re goin through
You know it's gon' be okay, okay, today, today
Even when the earth quakes
We gotta hold on, hold on, be strong, be strong
I know that you don? t think that I can read your palms
But I see the dawn, the dawn, beyond
B'yond I can see the sunlight
And if the rain falls down
It ain? t nothing but a blessed day today
The sun will shine after the rain dries
(Mavado):
To all mah thugs dat gone, memories live on, I guess
See you at the crossroad
So many cry when we die and they wonder if we're in the sky
See you at the crossroad
I see you in my dream, dat night, dat crime scene
But don't worry, see you at the crossroad
Remember we still a team and I know you can hear me now
See you at the crossroad

(Chorus)
Hold on(ain't gotta be that way), be strong
No matter what you're goin through
You know it's gon' be ok, ok, today, today
Even when the earth quakes
We gotta hold on, hold on, be strong, be strong
I know that you don't think that I can read your palms
But I see the dawn, the dawn, beyond
B'yond I can see the sunlight
And if the rain falls down
It ain? t nothing but a blessed day today
The sun will shine after the rain dries
She wants to know, she wanna know how long I been playin'
As long as my mother, as long as my momma she been prayin'
She bought me a guitar, she bought me a guitar at eleven
She ain't want me be usin mac 11's
When I sing, so when I said daddy was gone 'til November
I knew, I knew that he wouldn't be back in November
Cause I could've been the one in the bank with a shank
With a pump and a ski mask
But my bank is the stage, my 12 gauge is black ***
Hold on,(ain't gotta be that way) be strong, be strong
No matter what you're goin through
You know it's gon' be ok, ok, today, today
Even when the earth quakes
We gotta hold on, hold on, be strong, be strong
I know that you don't think that I can read your palms
But I see the dawn, the dawn, beyond
B'yond I can see the sunlight
And if the rain falls down
It ain't nothin' but a blessed day today
The sun will shine, after the rain dries
If the rain falls down
It ain't nothin' but a blessed day today
The sun will shine, after the rain dries
Rain dries, rain dries
