Wyclef Jean - Million Voice
Kinyarwanda Chorus throughout song:
-----------------------------------

Ni ryari izuba, Rizagaruka, Hejuru yacu
Ni nd' uzaricyeza ricyeza

Which means:
When will the sun return above us?
Who will reveal it once again to us?
-----------------------------------

Rwanda, Rwanda
Yeah Rwanda, Rwanda

They said: "Many are called and few are chosen,"
But I wish some wasn't chosen
For the blood spilling of Rwanda

They said: "Meshach Shadrach and Abednego
Thrown in the fire but they never got burned,"
But I wish that I didn't get burned in Rwanda

They said: "The man is judged according to his works,"
So tell me Africa, what's your worth?

There's no money, no diamonds, no fortunes
On this planet that can replace Rwanda…

Rwanda Rwanda

Yeah, Rwanda Rwanda

These are the cry of the children

Rwanda Rwanda

Anybody hear my cry?

If America, is the United States of America
Then why can't Africa, be the United States of Africa?

And if England, is the United Kingdom
Then why can't Africa unite all the kingdoms
And become United Kingdom of Africa?

Rwanda Rwanda, Rwanda Rwanda
Yeah, yeah

These are the cries of the children, yeah

Can anybody out there hear our cries?

Yeah, heavens cry ... Jesus cry

Lord, did you hear us calling you?
Yeah, Rwanda Rwanda

Lord, did you hear us calling?
Can you do something in Rwanda?

Rwanda Rwanda, Rwanda Rwanda

I'm talkin' 'bout Jesus; talkin' 'bout
Rwanda Rwanda Rwanda

Talkin' 'bout … talk'n 'bout ...
Talkin' 'bout … talk'n 'bout ...

I wanna play my guitar for Rwanda....
