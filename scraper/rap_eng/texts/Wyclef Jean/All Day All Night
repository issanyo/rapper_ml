[Intro:]
All day, all night, all day, alright
All day, all night, all day, uh, alright

[Verse 1:]
All my niggas is trill as fuck
I was born in the trap game real as fuck
On the way to the top can't fuck this up
Put too much work in, did too much dirt then
Turn around to the tree, make a motherfucking Motown
How a nigga gonn slow down? Feds ridin at nigga
Hope you on the right dream when the shit go down
Oh you actin like a hoe now, well go and lay on your back, back, back
I'm from the ATL, where we stay up all day and all night
To get the stacks, stacks, stacks

[Hook: x2]
All day (all day), all night (all night)
Getting to it (getting to it), alright (alright)
All day (all day), all night (all night)
Countin money
You know what we like

[Bridge:]
Work, work, gonna twerk out
Work, work, gonna twerk out
Work, work, gonna twerk out
Gonna twerk out

[Verse 2:]
I put my arms up to the sky
I'm missing my dogs
Wishing they were here nigga
I stayed on that prize, I'm smelling blood
This is our year nigga
No time for that bullshit, we gonn celebrate
Cause we here nigga
Black tree in this bitch, go on have a beer, cheers nigga
So stop with a nigga never sold a soul, with a new regime, we in overload
Pop that belly ring to that trap n roll
If you love me baby catch me on the road
The young city, you already know what's with me
2 or 3 things, that's pretty
Light skin biggy
Smoking on the O with the Acapulco flow
But that guy just barely drink

[Hook:]
All day (all day), all night (all night)
Getting to it (getting to it), alright (alright)
All day (all day), all night (all night)
Countin money
You know what we like

[Bridge:]
Work, work, gonna twerk out
Work, work, gonna twerk out
Work, work, gonna twerk out
Gonna twerk out

[Hook:]
All day (all day), all night (all night)
Getting to it (getting to it), alright (alright)
All day (all day), all night (all night)
Countin money
You know what we like

Work, work, work
