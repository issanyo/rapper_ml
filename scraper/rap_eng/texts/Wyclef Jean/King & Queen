[Intro: Wyclef Jean]
I'm ready, I'm ready
Check, 'Clef, to, rock
Hey I'm dancin with this girl, you find your own girl
(Oh-own girl, oh-own-girl, oh-own-girl, oh-own-girl)
It's still no fightin tonight though homey
Geyeah, it's all love tonight

[Verse One: Wyclef]
My love good for all season, winter summer fall spring
I got de {?} flow, ting-a-ling-a-ling
Columbian swing when Shaki' do her t'ing
One bright feed de power like Lords of the Ring
Many fight fi the crown, but there's only one King
Many girls want the title, but there's only one Queen
One King for the Queen, one Queen for the King~!
I don't wanna wake up if this thing is a dream

[Hook: Shakira]
If you have no home, I'll be your shelter
Baby don't be scared
If you lost your sight, I would be your eyes
Lead you in the spotlight
If you've enough time, I will be one time
Only to be with you tonight
But ever is never, never enough time
To make it forever mine

[Verse Two: Wyclef]
Time after time, you get better like fine wine
I look into your eyes and see your soul in the skyline
Call me Mr. Freeze I feel a chill in my spineline
Cause every time you touch me, it's like a divine sign
Many fight fi the crown, but there's only one King
Many girls want the title, but there's only one Queen
One King for the Queen, one Queen for the King~!
I don't wanna wake up if this thing is a dream

[Hook]

[Verse Three: Wyclef]
And I don't wanna, put out this fire
Transition {?} momma
I feel my place where the soul get higher
Nights get cold I gotta hold ya
{?} slept in the middle of the sofa
{?} and a loafer, but we had each other
Christmas throw Santa down the chimney
Felt like Pookie from New Jack when he got the turkey
Cause we those ReFugees, survive the tsunami
So ain't nobody gonna tell me this ain't what I need

[Hook]

[Outro: Wyclef]
Shaki', 'Clef, Jerry Wonder what we tell 'em boy
(Find your own girl, find your own girl, find your own girl, find your own girl)
Yo Cliff, let the horns go
(Find your own girl, find your own girl, find your own girl, find your own girl)
