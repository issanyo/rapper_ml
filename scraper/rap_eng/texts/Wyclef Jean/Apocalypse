[Intro]
Yeah, I was looking out my window
When I heard this sound
Look up into the sky
Saw the moon turned to blood
Looked at my little brother
Said, "You high as hell man"

[Chorus]
Apocalypse
1, 2 the headline news just broke through
Apocalypse
3, 4 soldier, 100 horsemen at your door
Apocalypse
5, 6 you wanted dead or alive, hit or miss
Oui, oui, y'all, yeah, Oui, oui, y'all

[Verse 1]
Arrival of the Carnival
New beats, I never recycle
While you're looking for samples
You might get trampled
Surprise, hey
I'm back with lightning and thunder
I heard you over saying I'm a one-hit-wonder
You dumb or some, I went to refugees
â€™Til infinity, when I'm done
Collect royalty from record companies
Clouds getting darker
Sun's getting nearer
I'll turn an atheist to a God-fearing believer
The back of a building
Your body's found by children
Playin' hide go seek
All we found was his skeleton
In the back of a car
You spar with the wrong guards
You know my empire strikes back hard
This is launch, "War!"
It's the day after ashes
Project cannons
Being launched at the palace
Vision, revelation
Sky rode apocalypse
Enemy pilots kamikaze into the abyss

[Chorus]
Apocalypse
1, 2 the headline news just broke through
Apocalypse
3, 4 soldier, 100 horsemen at your door
Apocalypse
5, 6 you wanted dead or alive, hit or miss
Oui, oui, y'all, yeah, Oui, oui, y'all

[Verse 2]
Hey yo, back on earth
The party's at the tunnel
On the west side of the river
Went mad quiver
Rats get fed to the alligator
Gun blast equivalent to the bombs in Pearl Harbor
Rescue choppers Brooklyn turned to Hiroshima
I'm driving to Jersey to escape the terror
I was on the highway pushing a black viper
A car pulls up, is he a jack or a sniper (sniper)
A blue range rover, he says "Pull over!"
I didn't know he was a DT undercover
I screamed out my lungs
"This is discrimination!
What's the charge?"
He said you just robbed a gas station
"Who me? Not me! It couldn't be!
I was at the Grammys with Brandy
Didn't you see me on TV?"
"Bullshit, y'all all in the same gang!"
He tried to run me off the road
Like he was Rosco P. Coltrane
I stayed calm, gave him a hell of a show
'Cause if it's ever time to go
All I gotta press is turbo
Heard him on his walkie, road block on 280 west
Things got serious, that's when I bust a left
U-Turn, my tires burned
My concern, was a truck coming
Head on collision within a second changed position
Close one, I almost went up in a blaze
Running from what appears to be a masquerade
At least that's what I thought, it was all in my mind
Reality stuck when I got to the borderline
The headline reads every ghetto sad story
A rookie shoots a boy over mistaken identity...
(crash)

[Chorus]
Apocalypse
1, 2 the headline news just broke through
Apocalypse
3, 4 soldier, 100 horsemen at your door
Apocalypse
5, 6 you wanted dead or alive, hit or miss
Oui, oui, y'all, yeah, Oui, oui, y'all
Apocalypse
1, 2 the headline news just broke through
Apocalypse
3, 4 soldier, 100 horsemen at your door
Apocalypse
5, 6 you wanted dead or alive, hit or miss
Oui, oui, y'all, yeah, Oui, oui, y'all
