[Intro: Wycler Jean]
Wyclef AKA Mr. Reloaded
All di sexy girls, di sexy belly dem
Hey hey, this one goes out to the fine senoritas
All over the world belly dancin in the villa
See her in the dance gettin tipsy of Tequilla
The way she moves her hips she reminds me of Shakira

[Chorus: Yxia] (Wyclef Jean)
Belly dance, belly dance
(She gone get up and dance all night and do the) Belly dance
(New dance) Belly dance (New dance) Belly dance
(She wanna forget her problems tonight and do the) Belly dance

[Verse 1: Wyclef Jean]
I get a call from Shakira Shakira
I was gone but she made me come back before November
The rhythm of her belly got me dancin till the summer
I surrender, now every girl, come on come on
From Havana to Copa Cabana, Africa to Osaka
Di belly dancin gettin really hotter than di summer
Jamaican, Haitian, Latinas and Gyptians
Dem a do di belly dance and movin frisky
Di way dem a wine dem lookin tipsy
Tek a man rum and tek a bottle of whiskey
Girl yuh a wine and do di belly ting
Mi love how yuh look hot show yuh belly ring
And how yuh showed up showed up wid yuh pretty belly skin
Mek a man hair wanna stand uplike a Don King HEY!!!

[Chorus: Yxia] (Wyclef Jean)
Belly dance, belly dance
(She gone get up and dance all night and do the) Belly dance
(New dance) Belly dance (New dance) Belly dance
(She wanna forget her problems tonight and do the) Belly dance

[Verse 2: Wyclef Jean]
For Fully Loaded ask (?) you know I'm always loaded
Back for Fully Loaded tell Renaissance you know I'm always loaded
I got a truck full of girls dem a do di belly dance some slim some overloaded
Back to New York, to the airport
Girl pick me up in a brand new sport (HEY)
Look into her eyes and I got the feeling
Tonight she belly dancin to the ceiling

[Chorus: Yxia] (Wyclef Jean)
Belly dance, belly dance
(She gone get up and dance all night and do the) Belly dance
(New dance) Belly dance (New dance) Belly dance
(She wanna forget her problems tonight and do the) Belly dance

[Bridge: Wyclef Jean]
This one goes out to the fine senoritas
All over the world belly dancin in the villa
See her in the dance gettin tipsy of Tequilla
The way she moves her hips she reminds me of Shakira
Jamaican, Haitian, Latinas and Gyptians
Dem a do di belly dance and movin frisky
Di way dem a wine dem lookin tipsy
Tek a man rum and tek a bottle of whiskey
Girl yuh a wine and do di belly ting
Mi love how yuh look hot show yuh belly ring
And how yuh showed up showed up wid yuh pretty belly skin
Mek a man hair wanna stand uplike a Don King HEY!!!

[Chorus: Yxia] (Wyclef Jean)
Belly dance, belly dance
(She gone get up and dance all night and do the) Belly dance
(New dance) Belly dance (New dance) Belly dance
