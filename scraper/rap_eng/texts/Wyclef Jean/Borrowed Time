[Verse 1]
Falling from space, sometimes I feel out of place
Words we can't take back, if I could I would erase
Do whatever it take, to show you I appreciate
Before the angel tells me that it's too late

High noon the guns are drawn, it's a battle for love
Stand on the side as she watch it goes down
When it seems like the end, that's when it all begins
As she opens the door and lets me in

[Chorus]
We’re on borrowed time
Clock keeps ticking
Days keep passing
Oh we can’t waste no time
These are the days of lives
When we will fall
Just so we can rise
Just so we can rise

[Verse 2]
A Cinderella’s ball
Last call for alcohol
The saints marching in
While us sinners play the drums
When the shackles are broken
That’s when we all will run free
And we will no longer worship the beast

What once was built
I seen sadness destroy
But it make my faith stronger
I believe in the joy
And passion has kicked in
Like a thief in the night
And the touch feels like eternal life

[Chorus]
We’re on borrowed time
Clock keeps ticking
Days keep passing
Oh we can’t waste no time
These are the days of lives
When we will fall
Just so we can rise
Just so we can rise

[Bridge]
Uh huh, Ice-cubes in my drink, it’s a good day
Seen a drive by turn to love parade
Battleship turns to the love boat
Refugees found our home that we’re looking for
No more robberies
Everbody’s equal
Found the cure for the cancer
No more diseases
No bombs falling from the skyline
Peace, treaty, everybody co-sign
Colorblind, we all one people
One love, like a Bob Marley sequel
I’m sitting back listen to John Lennon
Imagined that it happened

[Chorus]
We’re on borrowed time
Clock keeps ticking
Days keep passing
Oh we can’t waist no time
These are the days of lives
When we will fall
Just so we can rise
Just so we can rise

We’re on borrowed time
