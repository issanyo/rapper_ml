I ain't come to fight tonight
Too many ladies up in here tonight
(Everybody report to the dance floor)
(Please, grab a girl)
I never really knew that
You could dance like this
She make a man wanna speak Spanish
Como se llama? Bonita, mi casa, su casa
When you move you got me hypnotized
Especially when I look into his eyes
Hey papi, I wanna see you
Do the dance to the Conga
Hey girl, I can see your body moving
(And it's driving me crazy)
And I didn't have the slightest idea
(Until I saw you dancing)
And when you walk up on the dance floor
Nobody cannot ignore the way you move body, girl
And everything's so unexpected the way you already left it
So you can keep on shaking it
Baila la calle de noche, baila la calle de dia
Baila la calle de noche, baila la calle de dia
I never really knew that
You could dance like this
She make a man wanna speak Spanish
Como se llama? Bonita, mi casa, su casa
When you move you got me hypnotized
Especially when I look into his eyes
Hey papi, I wanna see you
Do the dance to the Conga
Hey boy, now that I see all your rhythm
Im in a state of shock now, the way
I can see you body moving and
I don't want you to stop now
I like the way you approach me so sexually
You found me in the base boy
I can't ignore the way you dancing
You got me in a trance and I can't explain it
Baila la calle de noche, baila la calle de dia
Baila la calle de noche, baila la calle de dia
I never really knew that
You could dance like this
She make a man wanna speak Spanish
(Spanish)
Como se llama? Bonita, mi casa, su casa
(Si, si, yeah)
When you move you got me hypnotized
Especially when I look into his eyes
Hey papi, I wanna see you
Do the dance to the Conga
Senorita, fill the Conga, let me see you move like you come from Havana
Oh, I didn't know you did it like that
Hey a papi, don't you stop it, wanna see you move your body
Oh, I didn't know you did it like that
Baila la calle de noche, baila la calle de dia
Baila la calle de noche, baila la calle de dia
