[Intro]
Live up, it's okay
Live up, it's alright
Live up, it's okay

[Verse 1]
If tomorrow is judgment day
And I'm standing pon the frontline
And the Lord asked me, "What did I do with my life?"
I would say, I spent it with you

Live up, it's okay
Live up, it's alright

[Verse 2]
If I wake up in Worl War III (If I wake up)
I see destruction and poverty
Oh my, my, my
And I feel like I wanna go home
It's okay, you're coming with me

Live up, it's okay
Live up, it's alright

[Chorus]
Your love is my love and my love is your love
It would take an eternity to break us
It would take all the stars just to hold us
Your love is my love and my love is your love
It would take an eternity to break us
It would take all the stars just to hold us

Live up, it's okay
Live up, it's alright
Live up, it's okay

[Verse 3]
If I lose my fame and fortune (There's no way that can change me)
And I'm homeless on the street
And I'm sleeping in Grand Central Station
It's okay, you're sleeping with me

Live up, it's okay
Live up, it's alright

[Verse 4]
As the years, they pass us by (Years pass us by)
We stay young through each other's eye
And don't matter how old we get
It's okay, as long as I got you baby

Live up, it's okay
Live up, it's alright

[Chorus]
Your love is my love and my love is your love
It would take an eternity to break us
It would take all the stars just to hold us
Your love is my love and my love is your love
It would take an eternity to break us
It would take all the stars just to hold us

[Bridge]
If I should die this day
Don't cry, 'cause on earth we weren't meant to stay
And no matter what the people say
I'll be waiting for you after the judgment day
Yeah

[Chorus]
Your love is my love and my love is your love
It would take an eternity to break us
It would take all the stars just to hold us
Your love is my love and my love is your love
It would take an eternity to break us
It would take all the stars just to hold us
