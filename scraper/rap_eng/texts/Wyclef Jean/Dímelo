[Chorus: Jamaal]
Oh, you got my heart beating rápido
You got the boom like your name's J'Lo
You got them hips like Shakira
Smile like Camila
Got me feeling Latino

Dímelo, dímelo, dímelo
Dímelo, dímelo, dímelo
You got them hips like Shakira
Smile like Camila
Got me feeling latino

[Verse 1: Ashley]
We were, two stepping on the dance floor
And now ya, still telling me you want more
Podemos bailar 'till ya feet sore
Tengo a few moves at a top drawer (aye)
I grab your hand, we start to step (aye)
We salsa dance and move correct (aye)
She got me in deep like a scuba (woo)
I'm telling she hotter than Cuba

[Pre-Chorus: Jamaal,  Ashley]
The way you move, the way you move
Makes me wanna get close to you
I had to whatsapp my amigos
She moving like she from Puerto Rico

[Chorus: Jamaal]
Oh, you got my heart beating rápido
You got the boom like your name's J'Lo
You got them hips like Shakira
Smile like Camila
Got me feeling latino

Dímelo, dímelo, dímelo
Dímelo, dímelo, dímelo
You got them hips like Shakira
Smile like Camila
Got me feeling latino

[Verse 2: Wyclef Jean]
Shakira, Shakira
Still no fighting tonight
Wanna be startin' something, guilty feet ain't got no rhythm
That's George Michael moonwalking with Michael Jackson
Rihanna she give me wild thoughts
Baby take off like planes at Heathrow Airport
Figure 8 make man take bait
I never really knew that she could dance like this

[Pre-Chorus: Jamaal,  Ashley]
The way you move, the way you move
Makes me wanna get close to you
I had to whatsapp my amigos
She moving like she from Puerto Rico

[Chorus: Jamaal]
Oh, you got my heart beating rápido
You got the boom like your name's J'Lo
You got them hips like Shakira
Smile like Camila
Got me feeling latino

Dímelo, dímelo, dímelo
Dímelo, dímelo, dímelo
You got them hips like Shakira
Smile like Camila
Got me feeling latino

[Verse 3: Myles]
Pulled up, turning up and it was you that I saw
Mamacita, nice to meet ya, started dancing some more
Back to the table couple drinks we're just gonna pour
Then I whisper in her ear, "I've never seen you before"
Your body like an hourglass and now an hour pass (hey)
And now it's getting dark, how about we just leave this bar
We can reach the stars, pleasing you that's my task
Me and you can go cruising see some views up in my car

[Pre-Chorus: Jamaal, Ashley & Myles]
The way you move, the way you move
Makes me wanna get close to you
I had to whatsapp my amigos
She moving like she from Puerto Rico

[Chorus: All]
Oh, you got my heart beating rápido
You got the boom like your name's J'Lo
You got them hips like Shakira
Smile like Camila
Got me feeling latino

Dímelo, dímelo, dímelo
Dímelo, dímelo, dímelo
You got them hips like Shakira
Smile like Camila
Got me feeling latino

[Bridge: Jamaal, Ashley & Myles]
Oh, it's a party
Oh, it's a vibe
Oh, it's a party
Oh, it's a vibe, oh

[Outro: Jamaal, Ashley & Myles]
You got them hips like Shakira
Smile like Camila
Got me feeling latino
