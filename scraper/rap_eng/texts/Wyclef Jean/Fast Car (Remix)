[Intro]
Yeah
It's those jersey boys
Wa na na na na na
Wyclef, Jerry Wonder we're gonna take ya'll back to the Brooklyn basement
One time!

[Verse One: Wyclef Jean]
I heard a man say Jesus walks
Me myself I heard Jesus talk
Cause when I heard this beat I felt Jesus force
I heard it through the wire that he made it out the coma from a fast car
It was a fast car

(Jerry Wonder bring that old school beat back)

[Verse Two: Wyclef Jean]
Everyday is like the wild, wild west
Some of us are bad boys, some of us are outlaws
Unsolved mystery, the killa get away
L.A., Vegas in the end of the day in a fast car
Driving a fast car
(Are you ready to ride!?)

[Hook]
You don't gotta be no billionaire
To get a ticket up to the moon
We all know somebody up there
You need a helping hand look up right here
To help you see clearly now (yeah)
To help you see clearly now (yeah)
I hope you see clearly now (yeah)

[Verse Three: Lupe Fiasco]
(Lupe!)
Soon as they wave the checkered
Begin to drive reckless
Hope you have a wreck, but walk away deathless
And when they rush the car with the extinguishers, you gesture to the crowd with your fingers up that you're ok
That you're so saved
That you're so brave
Cause you live your life with one foot in your own grave
When you're defying death, that's when you're on stage
With a million on the dash and the crowd hoping you crash
So with the devil dared and you prepare for this to be your last
You ran outta gas

[Hook]
You don't gotta be no billionaire
To get a ticket up to the moon
We all know somebody up there
You need a helping hand look up right here
To help you see clearly now(yeah)
To help you see clearly now(yeah)
I hope you see clearly now(yeah)

[Verse Four:Wyclef Jean]
Come follow me, Come follow me, Come follow me, Come follow me
I see 2 kids in the alley, with ski masks with a shotty
One says: you ride shotgun?
We hit the liquor store
We get the cash and we take off in the fast car
Yes, they got the dough that's when I heard the shots blast
They try to speed it up but the hearse don't move fast

[Hook]
You don't gotta be no billionaire
To get a ticket up to the moon
We all know somebody up there
You need a helping hand look up right here
To help you see clearly now(yeah)
To help you see clearly now(yeah)
I hope you see clearly now(yeah)

[Hook]
You don't gotta be no billionaire
To get a ticket up to the moon
We all know somebody up there
You need a helping hand look up right here
To help you see clearly now(yeah)
To help you see clearly now(yeah)
I hope you see clearly now(yeah)

[Verse Five: Wyclef Jean]
Just ride everybody just ride
Just push on the pedal and slide
And if you feel what I'm feeling then you're live in the club
Then you gotta let somebody else drive now
Just ride everybody just ride now
Pushing in the club looking fly and alright now
Now all the fellas in the place man easy on the waist, man
We just trying to have a good time now

[Outro]
(Are you ready to ride!?)
