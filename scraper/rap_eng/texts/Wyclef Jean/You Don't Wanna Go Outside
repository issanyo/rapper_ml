Wyclef Jean with Spragga Benz
You know I got the reggae mix but this ain't complete
Know what I mean? To all the girls I cheated on before
Right about now all my thugs around the world
If you love reggae music I want you to do this

Check it out, yo
Ah, put your lighter in the air, right, right
Put your lighter in the air, right, right
Put your lighter in the air, right, right
This is going straight to number one, check it out, yo

Chickenhead
(Jack it up, jack it up)
Hey yo, what's your prize tonight?
(Yes, we have to jack it up)
I see it in your eyes
(Yes, we have to jack it up)
You'll be alright tonight

To all the girls I cheated on before, it's a new year
Hey yo, dear queen, by the time you get this letter
It's four pages but my name ain't Aaliyah

I don't know much about biology or chemistry
Failed the S.A.T.'s, study Brooklyn zoology
Remember me, Wyclef, the memory
Ecstasy with no theory of manoghany

To be or not to be, last words from Shakespeare
But a package says I wanna get the bitch with no fear
A few good men in a new millennium
Woman got a new law, if you cheat you're a dead man

So I've been dead like hundred times
Ask Cyndi Lauper, she'll tell you time after time
She became an infomaniac, wanted it all the time
A thin line between love and lust
She mistake me for the rapper when I said Can-I-Bus

Chickenhead
(Jack it up, jack it up)
Hey yo, what's your prize tonight?
(Yes, we have to jack it up)
I see it in your eyes
(Yes, we have to jack it up)
You'll be alright tonight

(To all the girls I cheated on before)
(Spragga Benz, where're you at, wher're you at?)
Chickenhead in a di bed, I feel dead, I feel dead
We have to jack it up, jack it up, keep up your head
Chickenhead in a di bed, I feel dead, I feel dead

We have to jack it up, jack it up, jack it up, yo
See my gal, she a gimme a hug each day I come
Each an hour, understand, now she be on the bum
Wake up in di morning, all she know we are alone

Each day I cheat on a chickenhead I figure on
Bust it, man, I go chill, me called a gal you wanna kill
She have faith, she have di skill
I know she want it she will

Gimme the right, a me remember
Me have to come back for November
But the gal fe mi calendar forget that be the day
Chickenhead in a di beb, I feel dead, I feel dead

We have to jack it up, jack it up, keep up your head
Chickenhead in a di bed, I feel dead, I feel dead
We have to jack it up, jack it up, jack it up, jack it up
(Yo Spragga Man, what's going on?)

Chicken head
(Jack it up, jack it up)
Hey yo, what's your prize tonight?
(Yes, we have to jack it up)
I see it in your eyes
(Yes, we have to jack it up)
You'll be alright tonight

To all the girls I cheated on before, it's a new year
Yo, yo, from the college dorm, until dusk is dawn
I never felt cold until I lost one
Don't let go like En Vogue chocked on

Clash of the titans, now I'm in my unicorn
I left New Jerus, I'm on my way to Brooklawn
Someone hit my bumper, I turned around and saw Sharon
Got surprised because I saw little Shawn

In the passenger seat with a bottle of Dom
Remain calm, called Cocren on the horn
Salaam, warm up the jeep 'cause a murder about to go on
What the bomb, bomb but this ain't a reggae song
It's like a old flick, Godzilla vs King Kong

If you saw the movie than you know what's gonna happen
Down South, West Coast, than back to Manhattan
Like Vanessa from 'Soul food' when she came at night
Thank God, it was a dream 'cause I woke up with my wife

Chicken head
(Jack it up, jack it up)
Hey yo, what's your prize tonight?
(Yes, we have to jack it up)
I see it in your eyes
(Yes, we have to jack it up)
You'll be alright tonight

Thugs around the world, yo
Ah, put your lighter in the air, right, right
Put your lighter in the air, right, right
Put your lighter in the air, right, right
Salaam Remi, Wyclef Jean, Spragga Benz
Nobody's safe no more

Lock your door, chickenheads on the loose
Oah, I'm out, Refugee Camp
ABC, for your crews wanna test
Goodnight, goodnight, goodnight
