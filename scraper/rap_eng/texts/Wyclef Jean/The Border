[Intro: Shakira & Wyclef Jean]
(The night is so young)
The night is so young
(The stars are so bright)
The stars are so bright
Love the way that I'm feeling
¿Que vas hacer?

[Chorus: Shakira]
Gotta work on my seduction if you wanna get it on
But if you think that I'm an easy catch, you're dead wrong
Gotta work on my seduction if you wanna get it on
But if you think that I'm an easy catch, you're dead wrong

[Verse 1: Shakira & Wyclef Jean]
Can I buy you a drink?
Hey, what you think?
I'm Superman, be my Lois Lane
I don't care if you're the only single man on Earth
Don't be sure you're getting lucky tonight
Don't be

[Chorus: Shakira & Wyclef Jean]
Gotta work on my seduction if you wanna get it on
But if you think that I'm an easy catch, you're dead wrong
Patience ain't a friend of mine
You ain't the only one in line
If you wash it boy, let it dry, let it dry
I got the recipe
Gotta cook it slowly
See, I'm your remedy
If you want to succeed
Just let the girl take the lead
Dammit, just for once in your life

[Post-Chorus: Shakira & Wyclef Jean]
(The night is so young)
The night is so young
(The stars are so bright)
The stars are so bright
Love the way that I'm feeling
Dance, I said

[Verse 2: Shakira & Wyclef Jean]
Can I buy you a drink?
Still ain't changed your mind?
I got a plan to make you mine
If you rush it, I don't like it
Don't you understand?
All the good things
Need that effort and take some time

[Chorus: Shakira & Wyclef Jean]
Gotta work on my seduction if you wanna get it on
But if you think that I'm an easy catch, you're dead wrong
Patience ain't a friend of mine
You ain't the only one in line
If you wash it boy, let it dry, let it dry
I got the recipe
Gotta cook it slowly
See, I'm your remedy
If you want to succeed
Just let the girl take the lead
Dammit, just for once in your life

[Post-Chorus: Shakira & Wyclef Jean]
(The night is so young)
The night is so young
(The stars are so bright)
The stars are so bright
Love the way that I'm feeling

[Bridge: Shakira & Wyclef Jean]
X-ray, I can see your insides
Turn around girl, lemme see your backside
Stop, I'm tryna be good, I'm tryna be good
O.K. you good, I'ma be the bad man
Steal your heart in the middle of the night and
When max man hits in the
Shaki grab the mic and hips to the max man

[Chorus: Shakira]
Gotta work on my seduction if you wanna get it on
But if you think that I'm an easy catch, you're dead wrong
Gotta work on my seduction if you wanna get it on
But if you think that I'm an easy catch, you're dead wrong

[Outro: Shakira & Wyclef Jean]
Oh, this is the place I'll die
For we both, this is the place I drain my love
Dance, I said
¿Que vas hacer?
