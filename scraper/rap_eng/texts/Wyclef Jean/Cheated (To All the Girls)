Wyclef:
Chickenheads, gobble, gobble
Thugs in the dance, no shootin', shootin', shootin'

Hook:
I cheated on you, you cheated on me
(to all the girls I cheated on before)
And this is not the way it's supposed to be
(It's a new year, I got a new change of gear, I swear)
So tell me girl, are you for real are you still down
I'm telling you, I have no time to fool around
(to all the girls I cheated on before)

Wyclef:
Hey yo, dear queen, by the the time you get this letter
It's 4 pages but my name ain't Aaliyah, what?
I don't know much about biology or chemistry
Failed the SAT's, study Brooklyn Zoo-ology
Remember me, Wyclef, the memory
Ectasy with no theory of manoghany
"To be or not to be", last words from Shakespeare
But a package says I wanna get rich with no fear
A few good men in the new millineam
Women got a new law, if you cheat you're a dead man
So I been dead like 100 times
Ask Cyndi Lauper, she'll tell you time after time
Like a virgin when I hit it for the very first time
She became a nymphomaniac and wanted it all the time
A thin line between love and lust
She mistake me for the rapper when I said "Can-I-Bus?"

Hook:
I cheated on you, you cheated on me
(to all the girls I cheated on before)
And this is not the way it's supposed to be
(It's a new year, I got a new change of gear, I swear)
So tell me girl, are you for real are you still down
I'm telling you, I have no time to fool around
(to all the guys I cheated on before)

Queen Pen:
Yo, I checked for you since I was straight up strugglin'
Before your cousin Jerry put you on, when you was nothin'
So why you play me like I don't know jack ish
('Cause like K-Solo, your mom's in my business)
Now who you wanna play loco to mine
Feelin' kinda twisted, heard through the grapevine
That I'm doin' my thing, more more waiting
(I swear) Many a years and many a tears
I use chose remix to make it quite clear
That he came in when you didn't want to be there
And I fell victim to this one night affair
By the time weeks came you was already there
And still I come home just looking at you
See I'm feeling kinda guilty but revengeful too
All the dirt you done done, you don't know a clue
Why I don't sex you no more, and that's not coo'

Hook:
I cheated on you, you cheated on me
(to all the guys I cheated on before)
And this is not the way it's supposed to be
(It's a new year, I got a new change of gear, I swear)
So tell me girl, are you for real are you still down
I'm telling you, I have no time to fool around
(let me sum this all up)

Wyclef:
Yo, yo, yo, and yo from the college dorm and til the dusk is dawn
I never felt cold until I lost one
Don't let go like EnVogue chocked on
Clash of the titans, now I'm on my unicorn
I left New Jerus, I'm on my way to Brook-lawn
Someone hit my bumper, I turned around and saw Sharon
Got surprised because I saw little Shawn
In the passenger seat with a bottle of Dom
Remain calm, called Cocren on the horn
Salaam, call up the chief 'cause a murder 'bout to go on
What the bomb, bomb, but this ain't a reggea song
It's like a old flick "Godzilla Versus King Kong"
If you saw the movie than you know what's gonna happen
West coat, down south, back to Manhattan
Like Vanessa from "Soul Food" when she came at night, B
Thank God it was a dream 'cause I woke up with my wifey

Hook:
I cheated on you, you cheated on me
(to all the girls I cheated on before)
And this is not the way it's supposed to be
(It's a new year, I got a new change of gear, I swear)
So tell me girl, are you for real are you still down
I'm telling you, I have no time to fool around
(to all the girls I cheated on before)

Salaam Remi collabo, Wyclef Jean, Product, yeah, Queen Pen
9-8 'til infinitee, for all you girls out there I cheated on before
