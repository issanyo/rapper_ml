[Intro: Wyclef Jean]
(Everybody on the floor)
East Side
(Everybody on the floor)
South Side
(Everybody on the floor)
North Side
(Everybody on the floor)
West Side
(Everybody on the floor)

[Beyoncé:]
We told you we was gonna give it to you raw
(Everybody on the floor)
We ain't do it right the first time
(Everybody on the floor)
We gonna do it right the second time
(Everybody on the floor)

[Chorus: Destiny's Child]
You make me wanna throw my pager out the window
Tell MCI to cut the phone poles
Break my lease so I can move
'Cause you a bug a boo, a bug a boo
I wanna put your number on the call block
Have AOL make my e-mails stop
'Cause you a bug a boo
You're buggin' what? You're buggin' who? You're buggin me
And don't you see it ain't cool

[Interlude: Wyclef Jean]
Come on, come on, come on
Yo who's bugging who?
Destiny is coming through
Wyclef, Jerry Wonder 'bout to hit y'all with the new groove

[Verse: Beyoncé]
It's not hot that you be callin' me
Stressing me, paging my beeper
You're just non-stop
And it's not hot
That you be leaving me messages every 10 minutes
And then you stop by
When I first met you, you were cool
But it was game you had me fooled
'Cause 20 minutes after I gave you my number
You already had my mailbox full

[Pre-Chorus 1: Destiny's Child]
So what, you're talking 'bout your feeling you's
So what, never told you to buy me shoes
So what, now you're rolling with an attitude
Plus the word on the streets is you're a bug a boo

[Chorus: Destiny's Child]
You make me wanna throw my pager out the window
Tell MCI to cut the phone poles
Break my lease so I can move
'Cause you a bug a boo, a bug a boo
I wanna put your number on the call block
Have AOL make my e-mails stop
'Cause you a bug a boo
You're buggin' what? You're buggin' who? You're buggin me
And don't you see it ain't cool

[Interlude: Wyclef Jean]
Come on, come on, come on
Yo who's bugging who?
Destiny is coming through
Wyclef, Jerry Wonder 'bout to hit y'all with the new groove

[Verse: Beyonce]
It's not hot that when I'm blocking your phone number
You call me from over your best friend's house
And it's not hot that I can't even go out with my girlfriends
Without you tracking me down
You need to chill out with that mess
'Cause you can't keep having me stressed
'Cause every time my phone rings it seems to be you
And I'm praying that it is someone else

[Pre-Chorus 2: Destiny's Child]
So what?
Ain't even like I knew you
So what?
Tell your peoples I ain't feeling you
So what?
Don't call me I'll call you
Cause cupid ain't shoot me, he shot you

[Chorus: Destiny's Child]
You make me wanna throw my pager out the window
Tell MCI to cut the phone poles
Break my lease so I can move
'Cause you a bug a boo, a bug a boo
I wanna put your number on the call block
Have AOL make my e-mails stop
'Cause you a bug a boo
You're buggin' what? You're buggin' who? You're buggin me
And don't you see it ain't cool

[Bridge: Beyoncé (Wyclef Jean)]
Yo, 'Clef
(What up? What up?)
We ain't heard from you in a while
So break it down for the chiren, Latin style

[Rap: Wyclef Jean]
Destiny's Child remade numero uno
You wanna hate me now like Nas
Cause you dos, tres, quartro
Thugs still in the dance
Ain't no need to bust you're A-K
We all can get along
Or we can do it Carlito's Way
Cause even though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death
I fear no evil, got the Lord present, standing Eagle
Way before birth I had this whole book memorized
I roll with murderers that just got baptized
I be allowed to see through the eyes of Zion
The New Jerusalem
So sing the hook and stop buggin'

[Chorus: Destiny's Child]
You make me wanna throw my pager out the window
Tell MCI to cut the phone poles
Break my lease so I can move
'Cause you a bug a boo, a bug a boo
I wanna put your number on the call block
Have AOL make my e-mails stop
'Cause you a bug a boo
You're buggin' what? You're buggin' who? You're buggin me
And don't you see it ain't cool

[Outro: Wyclef Jean]
Hey, yo
It's the Refugee Camp
