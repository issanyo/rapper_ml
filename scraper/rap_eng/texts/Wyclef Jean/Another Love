Standin on the corner, waiting for you all night
Girl, where you've been?
Left word that you'd be there
Found out that you took the red eye flight
Called you on the phone, don't pick up, straight to voicemail
Woah no, must be with your other love
He can't do it like me, he can't love you like me so
I ain't stressin, woah no I'll just get me, another love
He can't kill it like me, you don't miss it from me so
I ain't stressin, woah no
I'll just get me, another love
All the ladies in the area, let me see you put your hands on your area
Wyclef in the area, oh Cab won't you talk to the girls now
She pop up like the sauna, vibe's got me feelin right
Don't wait up, I'm out with my new friend, yeah
She don't give me drama, do everything you don't
Now guess what? Straight to voicemail when you call now
I'm with my other love
He can't do it like me, he can't love you like me so
I ain't stressin, woah no I'll just get me, another love
He can't kill it like me, you don't miss it from me so
I ain't stressin, woah no
I'll just get me, another love
She the best, she make a man wanna put his name on her chest
I love the way the wind man be blowin up her dress
And when we caress, kiss her on the neck, then vroom bully like the one shop for rents
She said she wanna go all night
Look in her eyes, she got me hypnotized
Through her red dress I see the bright light
Hey girl, you the number one prize
Number one prize, you the number one prize
Put up your hand if you the number one prize
Fellas in the place if you girl on the rise, put up her hand if she the number one prize
He can't do it like me, he can't love you like me so
I ain't stressin, woah no I'll just get me, another love
He can't kill it like me, you don't miss it from me so
I ain't stressin, woah no
I'll just get me, another love
He can't do it like me, he can't love you like me so
I ain't stressin, woah no I'll just get me, another love
He can't kill it like me, you don't miss it from me so
I ain't stressin, woah no
I'll just get me, another love
