[Intro:]
Saga faite
The Haitians just arrived
Choppa Zoe
Yea
Wyclef Jean, Choppa Zoe

[Bridge:]
This the life, this the struggle
And I'm a show em how to hustle
This the life, this the struggle
And I'm a show em how to hustle

[Hook 1:]
I'm on my Cuba, where the VI social club
Aye aye aye
Some fall for the Columbian
I'm rollin with the Panamanian
And I'm movin with Dominican
You tryna have a conversation with a Mexican
One life, one heart
I love the Coheba
I got to celebrate cause I ain't promised tomorrow

[Verse 1:]
I swear this life heaven cause I came from here
Set the game on flame, watch me give em hell
17, I was locked down in a cell
Man this life ain't for me, is what I told myself
Age coming on the mama, know she need the help
Haiti still in the range, know they need the help
Should elect Wyclef for prez 'cus that woulda helped
Game of 21, every man for himself
'79 – uncle left Haiti to chase the wealth
18 – did the same just to chase the wealth
Have a space plan, they recall a midget deal
She was a 8, 9, 10 'cus the money help
Cuban mom they got that juicy so I call er welch
Was on the A kind, never seen bad as hell
Instead of standing like a man, suck a nigga lip
Dreamin all on his own, all by myself
I'm putting on for my city all by myself
I was movin all the peas all by myself
I refused but he workin them odd jobs
A nigga grind hard, that's why these Haitians die hard

[Hook 1:]
I'm on my Cuba, where the VI social club
Aye aye aye
Some fall for the Columbian
I'm rollin with the Panamanian
And I'm movin with Dominican
You tryna have a conversation with a Mexican
One life, one heart
I love the Coheba
I got to celebrate cause I ain't promised tomorrow

[Verse 2:]
I'm on my fella Gucci shit, I ran for president
They said I got no residence, what's the evidence?
All I wanted to do was bring my country a new dream
They thought I had the policies like hatin on me
I paint them pictures with my rap line (Picasso)
Got soldiers, boy they young in minds
AK-47 is the gun of choice
A million voices, left for one to no choice
Hootsy Tootsy, what's next?
Everybody got a gang, we all throwin stacks
I got a whole gang and they all from Cuba
Reppin that Santa Maria
Avon bought that track with the latin blood
Believers better be on board, I'm on that Noah's flood
Yea, man I love it in America
Like Eddie Griffin man, comin to America
Real talk man, I worked in the fast foods
Plucked the managers, they all good
Can't see the vision of a young man
I had a plan to get a big bang

[Bridge:]
This the life, this the struggle
And I'm a show em how to hustle
This the life, this the struggle
And I'm a show em how to hustle

[Hook 2:]
I'm on my Cuba, where the VI social club
Aye aye aye
I'm in the club with the Nigerians
And by the way that she movin now you know she is Brazilian
Any problem with Dominicans
Then it's back on the plane and I'm headed to the motherland
One love, one heart
I love the Coheba
I got to celebrate cause I ain't promised tomorrow

[Verse 3:]
Me and the mexicans got something in common
We all got problems with immigration
Why you tryna send my parents back to they country?
Many people embark from the land of the free
I was raised with them grizzly grizzly grizzly bears
And the way you runnin they can smell the fear
And I can see your eyes, you ain't ready for this
And I can see the Future, Nostradamus
And I can see the president on my laptop
Playin the game of life on my X-Box
We're in Papoto, lookin like real life
No I'm still in sue, Miami Vice
And be clear, this is more than rappers real words
We do them real movies – Spielberg
Have you heard? General's back
The word on the street, every time rap
Gotta make sense every sentence
This is more than rap, it's real life convinced
True TV, 3D vision
Stevie Wonder, superstition

[Hook 2:]
I'm on my Cuba, where the VI social club
Aye aye aye
I'm in the club with the Nigerians
And by the way that she movin now you know she is Brazilian
Any problem with Dominicans
Then it's back on the plane and I'm headed to the motherland
One love, one heart
I love the Coheba
I got to celebrate cause I ain't promised tomorrow

One love, one heart
