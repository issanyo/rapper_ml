[Intro: Lauryn Hill]
Refugees up in here
Booga Basement style
On the John Peel show
Giving you a little reggae, a little R&B, a little hip-hop
Stevie Wonder style, you know how we do
Buss it

[Verse 1: Lauryn Hill]
Where has my love gone
How can I go on
Is peace not here for me to see

[Wyclef]
I'll be gone to November
I'll be gone to November

[Lauryn Hill]
Where is my spirit
See I'm nowhere near it
It seems dear love has gone away

[Hook]
So I blame it on the sun
The sun that didn't shine
I blame it on the wind and the trees
I blame it on the nights I never was in love
I blame it on the times that could not be
But my heart blames it on me

[Verse 2: Lauryn Hill]
Yeah I'mma tell you a little story Pras
It went like this, bust it
You see I loved hard once
But the love wasn't returned
I found out the man I'd die for
He wasn't even concerned
In time he turned he tried to burn me like a perm
Though my eyes saw the deception my heart wouldn't let me learn from, umm
Some dumb woman was I
And every time he'd lie, he would cry and inside I'd die
My heart must've died a thousand deaths
Compared myself to Toni Braxton
Thought I'd never catch my breath
Nothing left
He stole the heart beating from my chest
I tried to call the cops
That type of thief they can't arrest
Pain suppressed
Will lead to cardiac arrest
Diamonds deserved
Diamonds but he convinced me I was worthless
Bust it

[Verse 3: Lauryn Hill]
Wish I could tell you what I am feeling
But words won't come for me to see
What I want to know is
Who poured the love out
What made this bitter doubt
Is peace not here for me to see

[Refrain]
So I blame it on the sun
The sun that didn't shine
I blame it on the wind and the trees
I blame it on the days that ended once too soon
I blame it on the nights that could not be
But my heart blames it on me
Bust it
But my heart blames it on me
But my heart blames it on me
Blames it on me, on me, on me
Who poured the love out
What made this bitter doubt
Who poured the love out

Yo yo see cool it down, MC's should slow it down
Ohh, watch out
Before they lose control
Yo yo see cool it down, mc's should slow it down
Ohh, watch out
Fugees is on a roll

We just looking for the love today
Where's the love at
All the peace mc's settle the violence
Play more music, make more phat beats
Leave all the violence some place else

Where is the love
Say where is the love
Where is the love
Where is the love
Where is the love [x2]
