It's 2:45 the baby takes his first breath
The mother never knew he only had a few left
And the father gets a call in the middle of the night
His breath gets short and his chest gets tight

But he's 16 and he's driving too fast
Takes a turn to the left, it would be his last
The body knows what happens if he turns to the right
The body in the car woulda died that night

But he's 32 and invincible
The cancer he had it was visceral
He never saw it coming
But he had his own life
Sick in the morning and he died in the night

We're all so
We're on the line
We're all
We're all [oh]
We're wasted, no no no
We're all wasted
We're wasted, no no
We're all wasted

He's 7 years old, got his bat in his hand
He's looking for his father and he doesn't understand
'Coz dad's too busy got some deals on the way
His son sits alone as the children play

And he's 18, couldn't wait to move out
His parents wonder what all the rush is about
They never bothered with his dreams only thinking of theirs
Wonder's why he doesn't call and why he doesn't care

But he's 32 and invincible with
Everything he is based on principle
He never had a truly happy moment in his life
He didn't want the kids and he didn't want his wife

We're wasted, no no no
We're all wasted
We're wasted, no no
We're all wasted
We're wasted
We're all wasted
We're all wasted, no no
We're all wasted

23 now, got his life in his hands
He's looking all around and he doesn't understand
'Coz life's too busy, things get in the way
We all feel alone every single day

And I'm 18, couldn't wait to move out
It's been five years and now I'm starting to doubt
Whether all my dreams are just aimless stares
Looking out to someplace that isn't there

When I'm 32 will I be miserable when
Everything around based on principle
Well, I have a clue, wouldn't it be nice
To never be alone in this wasted life

We're wasted, no no no
We're all wasted
We're wasted, no no
We're all wasted
We're wasted
We're all wasted
We're wasted, no
We're all wasted
