I got I got I got I got
Slavery, black history inside my DNA
Poor ones with a peace and W in my DNA
I'm an inbred, chosen, win or lose its in  my DNA
And to tussle through transition, brah that's my DNA
I ain't a pawn like this
They play like Chester, hate us with deception
Then I brainstorm like this, got arms like this
Got two 1's, that's 11
They incarcerate no proof or tape
They take our fucking heads
Monsters underneath the bed
I got I got I got I got
Jesus piece the necklace see is in my DNA
I got millions, plan for billions 'cause its in my DNA
I got (?) that live in sin, they wanna rob my DNA
I got God, I got Twelve Tribes of Judah in my DNA
I just kick again then kick again like world cup score a goal
Yah that's him again, running through the cup like Ronaldo
I do public work, they try to Titanic the ghetto star
I know how they work, I know who you are
You are you are you are
(?) that's your DNA
Karma said we gonna find the proof and steal your DNA
Popo say you snitch
(?) to the DEA
33rd degree
Meditation deeper than the sea
My epiphany, my astrology
It leads me to the sun
Shit I been through
Strategizing like Sun Tzu's little son
I know stoners, eviction
Gunners, runners
Robbers, miners, dead
Redemption
Holy fathers dead
With cousins sitting at the fed
The government yeah yeah yeah
Man they got our DNA
Born inside a hut
Where rasta man they smoke the highest grade
When I was ten
Mama came and got me took me from the grade
At twenty-nine
I'm a Fugee with a butler and a maid
And I'm so loud
Social teacher man she called me introvert
Put in that work like Jersey twerk
And I'm Soleil like the Cirque
And all I know is to overwork
Green card hoes will plead a case
The doctor babies gotta save
Imma call that truce when the people say
We got liberty and victory its in our DNA
Got guitar in my DNA
Jimi Hendrix in my DNA
The guitar in my DNA
