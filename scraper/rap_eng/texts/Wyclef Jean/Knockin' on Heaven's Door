I remember playin my guitar in the projects
Playin in the PJ's
A product of the environment
Pour some liquor for those who passed away
I told my mom I'mma get up out of da hood
Mama
My dad taught me the American dream, baby
You can be anything that you wanna be
If I did it y'all could do it
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Mama, take these guns away from here
Mama, I can't shoot them anymore
Cease fire
I feel a dark cloud coming over
So poor, so dark
It feels like I'm knockin on the heaven's door

To Biggie Smalls and 2Pac
Knock, knock, knockin on the heaven's door
Hip-Hop
To Freaky Tah and Big Heavy
Lost boy
Knock, knock, knockin on the heaven's door
Yeah
And to the Princess Aaliyah
We're knock, knock, knockin on the heaven's door
To my brother Big Pun

We're knock, knock, knockin on the heaven's door
Oh Lord, Oh Lord

Would someone take these guns away from here
Take these guns from the street, Lord
I can't shoot my brothers anymore
I seen a thug cry
I feel a dark cloud coming over me
Over me
It feels like
It feels like I'm knockin on the heaven's door
So sing along street children

We're knock, knock, knockin on the heaven's door
And to my daddy that passed away
Rest in peace
Knock, knock, knockin on the heaven's door
To the God, Fred Jordan, we're
And put the Fugees on
Knock, knock, knockin on the heaven's door
To my people doin time
We're
Locked up
Knock, knock, knockin on the heaven's door

Crypts and Bloods, Latin peace
Please just chill wit the violence
Though even though I know that the bad boy move in silence
I'm asking y'all please chill wit the violence
Said even though I know that the gangsters move in silence
Whoa
We're knock, knock, knockin on the heaven's door
To my people in the Twin Tower
We're knock, knock, knockin on the heaven's door
And to my soldiers in the Pentagon
We're knock, knock, knockin on the heaven's door
New York
