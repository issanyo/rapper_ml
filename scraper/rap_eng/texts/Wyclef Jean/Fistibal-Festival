Yeah
Guess who's in the carnival this year?
Yeah
Wyclef, alongside Bud and my refugees

We gonna hit them with the rhythm of the night
Refugee is going to leave them all behind
We gonna hit them with the rhythm of the night
Refugee is gonna take them on a flight

???

We gonna hit them with the rhythm of the night
Refugee is going to leave them all behind
We gonna hit them with the rhythm of the night
Refugee is gonna take them on a flight

I ain't shy, no proper playa hater
I'm sure I do do why?
I ain't shy, no proper lying son?
Ce va no francais
?

Ladies fine, let us get closer
Let me see you go down a little lower
Don't cheat and hold on to my shoulder
Want to see who's some real bad breakups

Sex entwined and I got my drink on
Don't push and spill the hatuva?
Carnival and it's time to party y'all
If you'll permit me then the bag will hate with y'all

???
???

Right now get your flags
And this is what I want y'all to do

Wave to the east
Wave to the east
Wave to the east
Wave to the east
Wave to the east
Wave to the east

All my ladies
And my shorties
All my ladies

We gonna hit them with the rhythm of the night
Refugee is going to leave them all behind
