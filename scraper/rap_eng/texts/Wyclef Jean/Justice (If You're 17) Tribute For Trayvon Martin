[Verse 1]
If you’re 17 and you’re wearing a hoodie
You’re on your phone talking to your shawty
Make no mistake, there’s one like you in every city
You know the story
He gonna creep up, from behind
Have you leave earth before your time
By the time, oh for sure
He gonna say he was so scared
That he shot you up

[Hook]
He could have been the next president
He could have been the next Steve Job
He could have been the next astronaut
So until we can judge this

[Verse 2]
We won’t stop, neighborhood watcher
If you’re 17 with a hoodie on, watch out for the neighborhood watcher
If you at the right neighborhood at the wrong time
Neighborhood watcher
This might be your last call to your girlfriend
Neighborhood watcher
Man I fear for you, if you’re 17
If you’re 17 you should learn the law
Fight with your mind, stronger than arms
Make no mistake, there’s one like you
On every block, in every country

[Bridge]
Soon as unite, and become one game
Like the bridges and the tunnels if they don’t understand
Freedom yeah, for Trayvon

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
We won’t stop, cause the man he killed
He called him a fool
But how … you gonna come to a gun fight
With no guns to draw
The younging that you … blood spill
You consider in my family
But … to the floor, and he didn’t pull his ratchet
You need to stop it, neighborhood watcher

[Outro]
If you’re 17 with a hoodie on, watch out for the neighborhood watcher
If you at the right neighborhood at the wrong time
Neighborhood watcher
This might be your last call to your girlfriend when shots fire
Man I fear for you, if you 17, neighborhood watcher
Neighborhood watcher, oh, neighborhood watcher, oh
