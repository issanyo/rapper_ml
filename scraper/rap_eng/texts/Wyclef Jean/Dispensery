What we gonna do when we get to Cali?
We gonna by ourself a marijuana ID
So when LAPD come and stop we
We can show em our marijuana ID

Then back to Chetaburg after New York City
And tell Bloomberg I want the ganja ID
So when NYPD stop me
I can show them my marijuana ID

Out in the hood we stay, the legislation say
We can our list to watch it's on a switch in every day
Out in Jamaica yo, we burnin every day
More lit to us and it's straightly the highest grade

Kush aka indica
Plants from Afghanistan and India
The same seed they used to lock the nation
The same seed we use to treat the patients
The same kush they grow in Mumbai
That's the same kush, man they sellin on the south side

She say she want legal kush every month
So she payin like 24 100 chunks
Yea, it's slowin down my membrane
I'm on that Snoop kush, so plane
In the Maybach she call me ganja boss
Supreme kush, Diana Ross

What we gonna do when we get to Cali?
We gonna by ourself a marijuana ID
Then check Bloomberg in New York City
Then go up in Queens and pick up Mobb Deep
Yo P

Queens brish down in Utica
Blaze more fire than Lucifer
Got my people serving time up in Attica
Fightin with officers, stay smoking marijuana
3 years in them box and I'm still blazed
OG kush, purple haze
Montego Bay, blue skies
Shaka boy, them bloodshot eyes

Tear it up then we smoke it up
After that keep rolling up
Til the police start showin up
Smoke alarm start blowing up

What we gonna do when we get to Cali?
We gonna by ourself a marijuana ID
Then we go back to New Jersey
Smoke some weed with governor Christie
Then check Bloomberg in New York City
Then go up in Queens and pick up Mobb Deep

I need that Acapulco, go get me that ganja black
Just landed 30000 feet, wanna be high as that
How is that? Fire back on you little lames
I got copter, even then I'm switchin planes
JFK to LA, homie I'm off
Just cop that marijuana hottie, give a fuck but I'm cautious
Police whilin, now we stylin in them Bentleys and Raris
Lookin young in the face so you know they gon carve me
My hobby got em hatin
My goons in here, they Haitian
My pocket filled with faces, shorty ass is goodness gracious
My liquor, I don't chase it
That was back when shit was basic
Shit so strong that niggas smoke
You would think that we just spaced it
Yo Clef what nigga doin when we land cause I'm impatient
