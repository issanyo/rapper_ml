No guts, no glory
No pain, no story
Mama mama, dont worry
Heaven on my mind, forever on my grind
Tell God, sorry
If this ain't heaven where the hell are we?
This kind of plane is so unusual
I'm beautiful, damnit, I'm beautiful
See everything happens for a reason
And the season, the reason and the season
See everything happens some place and time
So before the mirror shines
Some people never see the sky
You, you think youve got it bad
You think the world owe you something
But it dont owe you nothing
Oh you, you think that youve got it bad
Some people have never had a chance at life
I live, I die, I laugh, I cry
The more I stay, the more the earth expends, and lends itself to sin
For Benjamin, I seen him crack his head with the Heineken
Then snatched his chain
The same place the sun fall, thats where it rains
And the same place the eagle fly, down comes the pain
And the same girl that bring me joy, she bring me pain
See everything happens for a reason
And the season, the season
See everything happens some place and time
So before the mirror shines
Some people never see the sky
You, you think youve got it bad
You think the world owes you something
But it dont owe you nothing
Oh you, you think youve got it bad
Some people have never had a chance at life
You should everybody shine
Put your hands in the air let me see touch ya the sky light
This time Ill give my energy and patience, success is waiting
You grind, everybody grind
If I ever used to grind I will never touch the skyline
Will I ever see the sky light, will I ever see the skylight?
You, you think youve got it bad
You think the world owes you something
But it dont owe you nothing
Oh you, you think youve got it bad
Some people have never had a chance at life
