[Intro]
You know who it is

[Chorus]
Oh boy, oh boy
I'm not your substitute lover, (said I'm not) oh no
Said boy, oh boy, I'm not your substitute lover, oh no

[Verse 1]
I know it would have been nice if I coulda had your body
Knowing that everybody ain't been with you (ain't been with you)
But you told me lies, you made me give my heart away
But now I know the games you play (no way)
So I'm through with you (so I'm through with you)

[Chorus]
Listen boy, oh boy, oh boy
I'm not your substitute lover, oh no
Said boy, oh boy, I'm not your substitute lover, oh no

[Verse 2]
You know there's gonna be a fight if these chicks keep calling you at night
I seen that text you're tryin' to hide, see I know the truth
Must be outta your mind, you thought you'd never see the day
You thought I'd let a player play, but I'ma upgrade you

[Chorus]
Listen boy, oh boy, oh boy
I'm not your substitute lover, oh no
Said boy, oh boy, I'm not your substitute lover, oh no

[Bridge]
See, there's not much you can say
He said he's done changed and I finished today
'Cause I can't do it no more, I will be there when you call
So you best to move on (move on)
Because I couldn't be your, your substitute no more
No, no, no, no, no, no
No, no, no
Listen, listen yo'

[Verse 3]
Listen, I said you can't call my name like I'm going out of fashion
And turn around and act like nothin' ain't happen
Like no, I'm not as cracking
Only when you need a chick
Only when you think about this hotness, you get the itch
That's when you get the itch
Baby, let me be your bitch
Boy, who you think it is? Bad gal nar tek dis
Actin like a little boy, play me like a decoy
You need to grow a couple, boy, you ain't got nothin' boy

[Outro]
So boy, oh boy, I'm not your substitute lover, oh no
Said boy, oh boy, I'm not your substitute lover, oh no
(If you're sick of these boots, try cheatin' like a substitute)
(Ladies, if you know this song, I want you sing along)
Oh boy, oh boy, I'm not your substitute lover, oh no
Said boy, oh boy, I'm not your substitute lover, oh no
