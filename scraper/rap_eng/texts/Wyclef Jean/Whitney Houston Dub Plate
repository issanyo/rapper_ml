[Interlude: Wyclef Jean & Whitney Houston]
Y'all wanna thank y'all for coming out tonight to see me
Right now put your hands together
For original, original diva, original dub plate
No one can play this but Refugee's on the number 1 tour
Now listen to Miss Whitney Houston (come with it)
Yo, this is Whitney Houston
Yes massive this is the original vocalist
I'd like to say rest in peace to Dennis Brown

[Verse: Whitney Houston & (Wyclef Jean)]
If tomorrow is Judgement Day (light is in the air)
And I'm standing on the front line (ayo)
Um, and the Lord asks me what I did with my life
I would say: "Wyclef murdered a sound boy" (yo, huh)
If I wake up in World War III
(If you believe in the most high, hands in the air)
I see the destruction in poverty
(East Coast, West Coast, hey, hey)
And I feel like I wanna go home (south side)
It's okay, as long as Wyclef is with me
(North Side, Jamaican, Caribbean, Haitian, hands in the air, everybody, hey!)
My dub is your dub and your dub is my dub (Ayo)
It would take an eternity to break us
And the chains of Amistad couldn't hold us (listen to Whitney)
My sound is your sound
'Cause the refugee sound is your sound (woo)
It would take an eternity to break us (c'mon)
And a million sound boys will die before us

[Outro: Wyclef Jean]
This for the hardcore, before I had the record deal youknowhatI'msayin'?
I'ma take y'all back when I was walking down the street
My little girl saying: "Yo Clef, that nigga tryin' to stick with somethin'"
Walk over to him and said, "Yo"
