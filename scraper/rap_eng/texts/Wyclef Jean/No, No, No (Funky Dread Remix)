When it's really yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
You'll be sayin' no, no, no, no, no
When it's really yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
(Why you frontin' when you know you really want it)

Boy I know you want me
I can see it in your eyes
But you keep on frontin'
Won't you say what's on your mind
’Cause each and every time you need me
You give me signs
But when I ask you what's the deal
You hold it all inside
If you wanna be with me
Ya gotta keep it real
Tell me what's going on
Tell me how you feel
Boy I know you want me
Just as much as I want you
So come and get my love
It's all here for you

You'll be saying no, no, no, no, no

If you keep acting this way
You're gonna lose my love
I ain't got no time to play
You better hurry up
Cuz every time I come around
And crews around your way
I see ya on the corner
But you don't know what to say
When I walk up to you baby
You seem so shy
What's the problem baby
Never had a girl like I
I can see right through you
And you know you wanna be mine
So get your act together
’Cause you're running out of time

You'll be saying no, no, no, no, no

You'll be saying no, no, no, no, no
When it's really yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
(Why you frontin' when you know you really want it)

Every time I see you with your boys
You pretend as if you don't want me
When you get home you call me on the phone
And tell me how much you care

[M.C.D.]
You go on like a chick, fancy D and that
When I come round, it's like
You're holding a dance in your flat
Bare people
When I say we need time alone
You flex like I should've left a message
On your answer phone
In a way, it's you who can't make up their mind
You're in your crib
You have to show me a sign
If you wanna deal with this
I have a job, but you're like
I don't care for you
Even though I'm there for you
I thought you knew
All my life I've been prepared for you
I won't lie, sometimes when we speak
I get shy
And when you go deep
I wanna touch your thigh
You know the kind of way
That I can feel your vibe
I'm being patient
Because you're love is being prescribed
You're the remedy
Around you, glad it's telling me
When people try to diss me
You're defending me
I hide my feelings
My heart is what you're sealing
Lay your cards on the table
Are we feeling?

You'll be saying no, no, no, no, no
When it's really yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
You'll be saying no, no, no, no, no
When it's really yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
(Why you frontin' when you know you really want it)
You'll be saying no, no, no, no, no
When it's really yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
You'll be saying no, no, no, no, no
When it's really yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
(Why you frontin' when you know you really want it)

You'll be saying no, no, no, no, no
