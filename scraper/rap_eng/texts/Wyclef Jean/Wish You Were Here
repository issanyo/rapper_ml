[Intro]
Let's go

[Verse 1]
So, so you think you can tell
Heaven from hell
Blue skies from pain
Can you tell a green field
From a cold steel rail?
A smile from a veil
Do you think you can tell?
Did they get you to trade
Your heroes for goals
Hot ashes for trees
Hot air for a cool breeze
Cold comfort for change
Did you exchange
A walk on part in the war
For a lead role in a cage

[Chorus]
Whether you listenin' to hip hip-hop
Or you tuning to rock
Refugees on your box
We gonna take over ya blocks

[Verse 2]
Let's go
How I wish, how I wish you were here
We're jus two lost souls swimming in a fish bowl year after year
Runnin over the same old ground
But have we found the same old fears
Wish you were here

[Chorus]
Whether you listenin' to rock
Or you pumpin' the hip hip hop
Refugees on your box

[Verse 3]
Critics don't mistake this for just any cover tune
I'ma take y'all to the "Dark Side of the Moon"
Kickin' in my mom's room this song was just a thought
A young refugee labeled, just come with a passport
Dad used to tell me about the American dream
My dream was waking up the projects
A young teen listenin' to hip-hop, my brother tuned me into rock
Put me up on Pink Floyd, a band from the British blocks

[Chorus]
Whether you pumpin' the hip hip hop
Or you tuning to rock
Refugees on your box
We gonna take over the blocks
From NJ to BK to the UK
