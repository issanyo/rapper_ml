I landed in Chicago, everybody loves Sosa
The youth in the street told me
We love you when shotters
Chicago, shoot first, think last
That's still my deal on the street now
Shoot first, think last
How long will this blood bath last?
Shoot first, think last
That's still my deal on the street now

Shoot first, think last
How long will this blood bath last?
Bang, bang, bang, bang
Everywhere it's a bang, bang, bang
Goons like ragatang
Everywhere it's a bang, bang, bang
Chicago got that bang, bang, bang
It's a bang, bang, bang
Goons like ragatang
Everywhere it's a bang, bang, bang

Welcome to Chicago, where the ghost of Al Capone roams the streets
And the kids they carry heat, and they hungry for the feast
And the dogs will do, whatever it takes to eat
Even if they gotta put your kids to permanent sleep

They boys, they shoot first, think last
That's the model on the street, yea
Shoot first, think last
How long will this blood bath last?
Shoot first, think last
That's the model on the street, yea
Shoot first, think last
How long will this blood bath last?
Bang, bang, bang, bang
Everywhere it's a bang, bang, bang
Goons walk around like orangutans
Everywhere it's a bang, bang, bang
Yea, bang, bang, bang
At the mall it's a bang bang bang
Street corner it's a bang bang bang
Even in front of the church they bang, bang, bang

God knows, seen the movie Shakas, I've been richy yes
But on these streets, I know the real richy yes
I got some of my homies, they won't see the next 30 summers
They got them in the cage, somewhere down under
Them boys, they used to

Shoot first, think last
That's the model on the street, yea
Shoot first, think last
How long will this blood bath last?
Shoot first, think last
That's the model on the street, yea
Shoot first, think last

If you wanna get the blood from them eyes show them love
Yeah, show them love
Wanna get the blood out they eyes show them love
Yeah, show the youth love
Wanna get the blood out they eyes show them love
Yeah, show the youth love
Yeah, just a little love, all they need is love
Cause he grew up with no papa
