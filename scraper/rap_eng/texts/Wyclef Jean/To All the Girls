[Intro]
Yo, Wyclef, It's time that I confess (Refugee Camp) to all the girls
(Don't do it, don't do it)
To all the girls I loved before
To all the girls I cheated on before
To all the girls I loved before

[Verse 1]
To all the girls I cheated on before, I tip my hat like Willie Nelson
You got pressure, take a sip of this Molson
Here's what happened, it wasn't my intentions
To fall into seduction while playing a temptation
I thought I had it figured out, but games don't last
The hourglass ran out, I got sprayed with the tear gas
Big men don't cry, hold my feelings inside
Stress brings me ulcers, I gotta hold my pride
When I see you with another guy, jealous thoughts of homicide
Call me selfish when I say Abraham has many wives
You say this is the 90's, either it's gonna be me or her
I found myself in a blur
Lookin' into the clouds thinkin' out loud
"I'm in love with two women, who is it gonna be now?"

[Chorus]
To all the girls I cheated on before, it's a new year
I got a new change of gear, I swear
I can see clear now the clouds disappeared
You forgive but never forget, so the past reappears, uh huh
To all the girls I cheated on before, it's a new year
I got a new change of gear, I swear
I can see clear now the clouds disappeared
You forgive, but you still think that I'm a ho

[Verse 2]
Second verse is gonna hurt, based on a true life story
I got married at 24 in New Jersey
You know the feelings start nature take it's course
Two years later 'Clef gets a divorce
When I had the cold feet, I shouldn't've walked the altar
With Dionne Warwick, she could predict my future
Went with my feelings even though it wasn't right
Creepin' with my secret lover in the middle of the night
Back home, break of dawn, dinner's at the table
Thin Line Between Love & Hate is on cable
I'm lookin' at myself thinkin' out loud
"I'm in love with two women, who is it gonna be now?"

[Chorus]
To all the girls I cheated on before, it's a new year
I got a new change of gear, I swear
I can see clear now the clouds disappeared
You forgive but never forget, so the past reappears, uh huh
To all the girls I cheated on before, it's a new year
I got a new change of gear, I swear
I can see clear now the clouds disappeared
You forgive, but you still think that I'm a ho

[Bridge]
Hotel, (I'm not a) motel, Holiday Inn (you don't believe me though)
And if your girl acts up at the carnival, then you take her friend
Hotel, (I'm not a) motel, Holiday Inn (you don't believe me though)
And if your girl acts up at the carnival, then you snatch her friend
Break it down right here

[Verse 3]
One love, you're lucky to have one love
It sounds bugged, drinking wine from the same jug
One heart, one mind, one soul
She ain't a gold digger, she don't care about your bankroll
Keep your money, she make her own cheddar
All she want from me is respect like Aretha
Cooked me lasagne, stayed in for the winter
Chilled to the summer, now I'm gone 'til November
Have you seen her?
I think I did
But what I did wrong was take a love for granted
Cause first comes trust, don't rush into lust
Easier said than done, I lust and I must
Passion is a must, but then we start to cuss
We was just makin' love, now we tearing up each other's guts
Like species, she called me an animal
So feel the tongue of the warm-blooded mammal

[Chorus]
To all the girls I cheated on before, it's a new year
I got a new change of gear, I swear
I can see clear now the clouds disappeared
You forgive but never forget, so the past reappears, uh huh
To all the girls I cheated on before, it's a new year
I got a new change of gear, I swear
I can see clear now the clouds disappeared
You forgive, but you still think that I'm a ho

[Outro]
I'm not a ho (repeat and dimminuendo at the same time)
(You don't believe me though)
I know you're diggin' this
Is it okay if I play my guitar right about now, is it alright?
(You don't believe me though)
Alright (you don't believe me though), alright
People in the back, is it okay if I play my guitar right about now?
Alright, alright, alright, alright
People on the side, is it okay if I play my guitar right about now?
