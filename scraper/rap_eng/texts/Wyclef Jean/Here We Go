The boys look so good but theyre minds are not ready
So here we go yall
Thats why Id rather talk to a man cause his mind is so steady
So here we go yall
Yo, the girl looks so good but her mind is not ready
So here we go yall
Thats why Id rather talk to a woman cause her mind is so steady
So here we go yall

Yo Yo Yo we dont like-a
A jealousy with envy
We dont like
When you smile and wanna blast me
We dont like
Stick up, give up your jewelry
We dont like
Suicide for milly or for dealy
What we like
Yeah is when we chill wit the herb
What we like
Is to drink in the Titanic wit no iceberg
What we like-a
Is when the thugs get hyper
Make sure what your brinme ain't carrying lice

Right about now if you ready for the ghetto princess Khadejia
Let me see one finger in the air

Da da da ( one finger in the air )
Da da da da daaah ( one finger in the air )
Da da da ( one finger in the air )
Da da da da daaah ( one finger in the air )
Da da da daah ( one finger in the air )
Daaah

Hey yo Khadejia Khadejia
