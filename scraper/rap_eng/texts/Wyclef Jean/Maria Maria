[Chorus: David McRae]
Oh Maria Maria
She reminds me of a west side story
Growing up in Spanish Harlem
She's living the life just like a movie star
Oh Maria Maria
She fell in love in East L.A
To the sounds of the guitar, yeah, yeah
Played by Carlos Santana

[Guitar Solo: Carlos Santana]

[Verse 1: David McRae]
Stop the looting, stop the shooting
Pick pocking on the corner
See as the rich is getting richer
The poor is getting poorer
Se mira Maria on the corner
Thinking of ways to make it better
In my mailbox there's an eviction letter
Signed by the judge said see you later

[Bridge: Santana + (Wyclef Jean)]
Ahora vengo mama chula mama chula
Ahora vengo mama chula (East Coast)
Ahora vengo mama chula mama chula
Ahora vengo mama chula (West Coast)

[Chorus: David McRae]
Oh Maria Maria
She reminds me of a west side story
Growing up in Spanish Harlem
She's living the life just like a movie star
Ho Maria Maria
She fell in love in East L.A
To the sounds of the guitar, yeah, yeah
Played by Carlos Santana

[Guitar Solo: Carlos Santana]

[Verse 2: David McRae]
I said a la favella los colores
The streets are getting hotter
There is no water to put out the fire
Ni gota de esperanza
Se mira Maria on the corner
Thinking of ways to make it better
Then I looked up in the sky
Hoping of days of paradise

[Bridge: Santana]
Ahora vengo mama chula mama chula
Ahora vengo mama chula (North side)
Ahora vengo mama chula mama chula
Ahora vengo mama chula (South side)
Ahora vengo mama chula mama chula
Ahora vengo mama chula (worldwide)
Ahora vengo mama chula mama chula
Ahora vengo mama chula (open up your eyes)

[Verse 3: David McRae]
Maria you know you're my lover
When the wind blows I can feel you
Through the weather and even when we're apart
It feels like we're together

[Chorus: David McRae]
Maria, yeah
She reminds me of a west side story
Growing up in Spanish Harlem
She's living the life just like a movie star
Oh Maria Maria
She fell in love in East L.A
To the sounds of the guitar, yeah, yeah
Played by Carlos Santana

[Guitar Solo: Carlos Santana]
