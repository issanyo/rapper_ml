Time Say
Say say I remember when we used to sit Ina
Government yard in brooklyn Uba
Uba solvin the crookedness As
We mingled wit tha good people we meet Good
Friends weve had and good friends weve lost Along
The waaaaayyy In
The this great futur You
Can't forget your past So
Dry youre tears I say To
My peepz across the way No
Woman no cry No
Woman no cry Say
Say say Here
Little sister don't shed no tears No
Woman no cry Say
Say say I
Rememer wen we used to rock Ina
Project yard in jersey And
Lil georgy would make the fire light As
Stolen cars pass through tha night And
Then weed hit the corner store For
Roots paper, and brew My
Drapes my only remody For
Pain of losin family But
While I'm gone shorty Evry
Thing is gonna b alright Evry
Thing is gonna b alright Fugees
Come to the dance tonight Evrything
Is gonna b alright Evryting
Is gonna b alright Evrything
Gonna b alright The
Gun man is inda house tonight But
Evrything is gonna b alright O
