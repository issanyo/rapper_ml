[Intro - Wyclef]:
Here come the drums
This is Wyclef
I'm a go to Senegal, pick up Youssou N'Dour
And this is what he told me when I picked him up

[Hook - Youssou with Wyclef]:
How come ? Ho-ow Ho-ow come ? (Here come the drums)
(Thugs wanna disrespect me in the clubs, how come ?)
How come ? Ho-ow Ho-ow come ? (Here come the drums)
(Shootouts over chickenheads, how come ?)
How come ? Ho-ow Ho-ow come ? (Here we go)

[Verse 1 - Wyclef]
Yo! I won the lotto, check out the lingo
Me and my micro, more chips than bingo
You still eso eso, your cool got no ammo
I'm not a communist but I get guns from Castro
Whether in trio or rockin' solo
Give up my chain cause you thought I was dolo
Oh, oh! He about to be zero
Send 'em back to Rio
Underground like Barbido
Played that kid out like Michael's brother Tito
And lay low in Cuba with the lady speaking espano
So Cococabana who am I on my scanner
My grammar-slammer any crew's who choose to do
So how come ?

[Hook - Youssou with Wyclef]
How come ? Ho-ow Ho-ow come ?
(How come I gotta wake up early to go to work ?)
How come ? Ho-ow Ho-ow come ?
(The boss is still paying me little money)

[Verse 2 - Wyclef]
For your girl, she's buff puff
And daytime no play rough
Freaks come out at night
So that's when I bring out the cuff
Grandma yeah, cd player no. 2
Sade's in my bedroom singing "sweetest taboo"
Thugs lookin' at me saying 'Clef don't bite your lips
Freak the girl shit
When was the last time you unloaded a click
Casinos and rockets
Sort of say hatchet
Just dressed as a waitress to get in your banquet
Can I take your order
You keep me to the shade
Compliments to the chef
Fettucini and hand grenade
Your eyes are hard, fall to the floor
I hear weeping, I pick up your heart
Squeeze it while it's still beating
How come ?

[Hook - Youssou with Wyclef]
How come ? Ho-ow Ho-ow come ?
(How come you're not breathing now ?)
How come ? Ho-ow Ho-ow come ?
(How come we don't chill out on the violance ?)
How come ? Ho-ow Ho-ow come ?

(I'm a gonna take you to Senegal for a second)
(In case you know nothing about it)
(Check the culture)
(Yo Youssou tell'em something man)
How come ? Ho-ow Ho-ow come ?
(I'm feeling you kid, I'm feeling you)
How come ? Ho-ow Ho-ow come ?
(How come the record company's always stressing me ?)
How come ? Ho-ow Ho-ow come ?
(How come my grandmother's still on welfare ?)
How come ? Ho-ow Ho-ow come ?
(How come whatever)

[Hook fading out - Wyclef]
Yo '98 for the heavy weight
Wyclef Jean and Youssou N'Dour
You know what I mean?
Now I'm going back to some America type o' shit
And I'm out
