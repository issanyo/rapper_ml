Sarah Connor (Wyclef Jean)
Intro:		(Sarah Connor it's an honour)
		(Wyclef - bounce -)
One nite stand
(C'mon)

Chorus		Love ya baby, drive me crazy
		Let me be your sugar daddy
		Looked into my eyes
I was convinced
		That he's real, (real)

		Girlfriend
Ever had a boyfriend
		Looked to be your best friend
		Turned out to be a
		One nite stand

Verse 1	He Loves Me
(I Love Ya)
He loves me not	
		He screams my name in bed
Makes me feel so hot
		But once he's out the door
He's already forgot
		The promises he made
At the break of light (break of light)
		To Love Me
		Protect me
		Not leave me
		Or hurt me

	I was so foolish
And so blind to see
		That all he wanted to do
Was to use me

		(Let's Go)

Chorus		

Verse 2	I Love him - I love him not
		I still scream his name in my bed at night (Wyclef)
		But once he's out the door
		He's already forgot
The promises he made at the break of light (break of light)
		He said he's  needing me
But he's misleading me- sayin' he loves me
But he's mistreating me

	I was so foolish
And so blind to see
		That all he wanted to do
Was to use me

(Let's Go, Let's Go)

Chorus		

B-Section	But don't feel sad, bad, mad
		Cause I've too been
		Through the rain
		And I can feel your pain
(Feel it)
		Mama told me
		There'd be days like these
		So I'm telling you ladies

		(Take me to the bridge, Sarah Connor!)


Bridge		Sitting in my room I'm all alone
		(You ain't gotta do that girl)
		My friends think I'm crazy
		Cause I'm waiting for your call
		Was it a dream or reality
		(When you said)
When you said you'd be
		With me
		(Oh Oh Oh)
		For eternity
(		(Oh Oh Oh)

Wyclef
Wyclef and Sarah Connor
		Holler, lend me your ears
This is the wickedest combination
Since Sonny and Cher
Say here girl
Take these dozens of roses
And let me part the red sea
Like I was Moses
Ah I
Love Is Love
Two wrongs don't make it right
So let's make love in the dark
Til we break daylight
Then hit the autobahn
You and me in a Ferrari
Fall asleep in Germany
Then wake up in New York City


Chorus		

B-Section

Outro		(Bounce now, wolves bounce now)
		Like sheep
		Watch out for the wolves wolves
That be dressed like sheep
C'mon bounce now, wolves bounce now
Like sheep
Like sheep, babe
(C'mon bounce now, wolves bounce now)
Like sheep
Watch out for the wolves wolves
One nite stand
(Bounce now)
Wolves bounce now
Like sheep
Watch out for the wolves wolves
One nite stand

Ladies, if you must have it
Make sure he wears a prophylactic
(Wolves bounce now)
Like sheep
(Bounce now)
Watch out for the wolves wolves
One nite stand
