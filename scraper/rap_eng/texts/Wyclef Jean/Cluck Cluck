[Intro: Wyclef Jean]
Excuse me
I got an announcement to make
Yo, if you ain't never been to Hempstead
Then welcome, where chickens cluck cluck day and night
G&B

[Hook:  Money Harm]
I see some chickens going crazy all up in my cage
I'm about to pluck two freaks
I'm up on my way
Cluck, cluck, bodies knocking all up in my crib
Anybody want to know, the party's till six
Somebody's knocking, knocking, knocking at my door
The same chick that you slept with
She claimed her man is coming home from a bid
She said after tonight she got to be with the kids
The kids, the kids, the kids, kids, kids

[Verse 1:  Money Harm]
I don't want to bring you complications
I just want one night of satisfaction
After tomorrow we can act like nothing happened
Take this invitation
With the metro card at the train station

[Chorus]
She said I do, I do, I do, I what
She said I do, I do, I do, cluck, cluck
She said I do, I do, I do, I what
She said I do, I do, I do, cluck cluck

[Hook: Money Harm]
I see some chickens going crazy all up in my cage
I'm about to pluck two freaks
I'm up on my way
Cluck, cluck, bodies knocking all up in my crib
Anybody want to know, the party's till six
Somebody's knocking, knocking, knocking at my door
The same chick that you slept with
She claimed her man is coming home from a bid
She said after tonight she got to be with the kids
The kids, the kids, the kids, kids, kids

[Verse 2: Sincere]
I don't want to force you to stay If you don't want to stay
I just want to thank you girl for making my day
But just in case you change your mind
I got a kingsize bed with a bottle of wine
Bath water runnin' 'cause I knew that she was comin'
And I didn't want to waste my time

[Chorus]
She said I do, I do, I do, I what
She said I do, I do, I do cluck, cluck
She said I do, I do, I do, I what
She said I do, I do, I do, cluck cluck


[Verse 3: Wyclef Jean]
Yo it's the innovator
In twenty years I'll be among the greats
Came in grimy
Now all my clothes are tailor-made
So all the cluckers want to know if I'm going to front them
That's when I flip out and turn into the werewolf of London
You all can't get no money even if you gave me money
You dig?
It's the iceberg slim philosophy
Wyclef, G&B up in your area
So many chickens fighting
It looks like riots in Africa

[Hook: The Product G&B]
I see some chickens going crazy all up in my cage (chickens baby)
I'm about to pluck two freaks
I'm up on my way
Cluck, cluck, bodies knocking all up in my crib
Anybody want to know, the party's till six
Somebody's knocking, knocking, knocking at my door
The same chick that you slept with (Who is it baby)
She claimed her man is coming home from a bid
She said after tonight she got to be with the kids
I see some chickens going crazy all up in my cage (I see)
I'm about to pluck two freaks (I see)
I'm up on my way
Cluck, cluck, bodies knocking all up in my crib
Anybody want to know, the party's till six
Somebody's knocking, knocking, knocking at my door
The same chick that you slept with
She claimed her man is coming home from a bid
She said after tonight she got to be with the kids
The kids, the kids, the kids, kids, kids

[Outro:  Money Harm]
Yo, I told you
Official jump off
Yo, Clef Records

[Outro: Wyclef, The Product G&B]
Wyclef, Jerry Wonda come on and come on and come on
She said I do, I do, I do, I what
She said I do, I do, I do, cluck, cluck
She said I do, I do, I do I what
She said I do, I do, I do, cluck cluck
She said I do, I do, I do, I what
She said I do, I do, I do, cluck, cluck
She said I do, I do, I do I what
She said I do, I do, I do, cluck cluck

This what I call cluck cluck, Hempstead farm baby
