[Verse 1]
She say she gon' be the first and the next
To lead the eagle out the nest
The man say he gon' build a wall
And have Mexico pay for it all
And there's riots every week
Their uniforms blue and the peoples on the streets
And everyone's living on their knees
Cause you could be the next one walking with the dead

[Hook]
If I was president
I'd get elected on Friday
Assassinated on Saturday
Buried on Sunday
And on Monday everybody goes back to work
Its just an ordinary day
Hey
But I could be the president, and you could be the president
And she could be the president, and we could be the president

[Verse 2]
Her t-shirt says "Black Lives Matter"
The media is screaming all lives matter
Charlie got a gun up in his hands
Walk up into the school and then you hear the bang bang
And Suzanna from Alabama can't walk no more
Cause she lost two legs in a war
And the USA ain't looking for the peace
All y'all got to do is smoke a little bit of weed
They don't want me to tell you about the secrecy
They don't want me to tell you about the conspiracy
They want to put a hole in my head like Kennedy

[Hook]
If I was president
I'd get elected on Friday
Assassinated on Saturday
Buried on Sunday
And on Monday everybody goes back to work
Its just an ordinary day
Hey
But I could be the president, and you could be the president
And she could be the president, and we could be the president
If I was president
