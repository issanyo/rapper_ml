“You Got Me” - Jazzy Amra Feat. Wyclef Jean and Riley

Wyclef:
Let’s work! (Let’s work)
It’s been a long time, I shouldn’t have kept y’all
I’ma turn the summer back to 96 y’all

And I could see the future girl
That’s 20/20
Yeah, major moves, but we Indie Indie
Let’s get it started Jazzy from the X

Yeah, Maddi say she got next
Word to Pun, I got her
Like Aaron Judge I’m the batter
I’m ready to hit the ball out the stadium into the trailer

Hands up all my lady gangs
Bang, that do anything to protect they king
Yeahh, players buyin bottles just to kick it off
And for the Queen I’ma set it off

Jazzy Hook:
You know you got me baby
You got me shook up, shook up, shook up off your love
You know you got me baby, I
I’m going crazy, crazy (let’s work)

Verse:
I know you like the way I shake it when I take it like that
(take it like that, take it like that)
And if we ever broke up I know you’d take me right back
(take me right back, take me right back)
You never lost respect for me, even though I could get crazy
You know that you’re my baby boy for real, Yeahhhh

Hook:
You know you got me baby

Verse:
I know you like the way I work it when I twerk it like that
(twerk it like that, twerk it like that)
You wanna take me on a date and buy me new bags
You should see the world through my eyes

That’s why you are my baby boy for real, Yeahhh

Bridge:
Treat me like a lady and you’re so damn fine

You in school and you got your head on right
And you know that I like that
Make it do what it do
Invite your friends to hang with my crew
You make me wanna do something crazy
Anything for you cuz you forever my baby
And I love you for that
You don’t tie me down
We’re too young for that
I know you wanna kiss me just close your eyes
I’m glad to give it to you cuz it feels so right

Feels so right...You know I got you baby

Riley Verse:
If Fuckin wit you wrong I don’t wanna feel right
I just wanna have fun
I know you feelin the vibes
Ain’t worried bout none
But what you doin tonight
Come kick it till the sun came up
