[Intro]
From the cry of the concrete
Rose can still grow

[Hook]
One time, for Mackazo
Two time for the Q Gar
Bless his soul
Now I'm a world star
God bless the zoes

See the blip up in the sky
And say the world is yours
Yea the world is yours
Yea the world is yours
See the blip up in the sky
Oh the world is yours
Yea the world is yours
Yea the world is yours
You see that blip up in sky

Yea, flags up
Hands higher
Wave them around like a helicopter
Flags up
Put your rags higher
Wave them around like a helicopter

[Verse 1]
What's good
Sa kap fet
Merci bonjoir I ain't in the faith
Back in the days under my tongue
I kept the switch blade
School face on the ground like subways
But like the King, I had a dream
Now my name on fire everywhere like hotwings
Uh, barbarian, barbaric with them bars
Toussaint Louverture is pumping through my blood
Road (?) Afganistan
I ain't Hollywood but I'm La La Land
Police cuffed me took my bandana
I'm too legit to quick even when they pull the hammer

[Hook]
One time, free Mackazo
Two time for the Q Gar
Bless his soul
Now I'm a world star
God bless the zoes

See the blip up in the sky
And say, the world is yours
Yea the world is yours
Yea the world is yours
See that blip up in sky
Oh the world is yours
Yea the world is yours
You see that blip up in sky

Flags up
Hands higher
Wave them around like a helicopter
Flags up
Put your rags higher
Wave them around like a helicopter

[Verse 2: Izolan]
(Haitian Creole ?)

[Hook]
One time, free Mackazo
Two time for the Q Gar
Bless his soul
Now I'm a world star
God bless the zoes

See the blip up in the sky
And say, the world is yours
Yea the world is yours
Yea the world is yours
See that blip up in sky
Oh the world is yours
Yea the world is yours
Yea the world is yours
You see that blip up in sky
