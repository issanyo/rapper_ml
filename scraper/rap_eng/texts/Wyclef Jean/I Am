[Intro: Tokio Hotel, Wyclef Jean & David Correy]
So you can say what you have to say
I am complete and you can't take that away
We are who we are, we are (x2)
We are what we say

[Hook: Wyclef Jean & Rock Mafia]
I Am
Worth It
I Am
Blessed beyond belief
I Am
Perfect
I Am (x3) What I say

[Verse 1: Rock Mafia & Wyclef Jean]
I Am
Yea where I'm from
It's a kaleidoscope of words
That's yet to come
So slow it down, and stir it up
I got my feet on the ground
And my head in the clouds
And I, nothing can keep me down

[Hook: Wyclef Jean & Rock Mafia]
I Am
Worth It
I Am
Blessed beyond belief
I Am
Perfect
I Am (x3)
What I say

[Verse 2: Rock Mafia & Wyclef Jean]
I Am
And you are too
And every stranger in the crowd
Is living proof
So let it fly, like a red balloon
I got my feet on the ground
And my head in the clouds
And I, nothing can keep me down

[Hook: Wyclef Jean & Rock Mafia]
I Am
Worth It
I Am
Blessed beyond belief
I Am
Perfect
I Am (x3)
What I say
I Am
Healthy
I Am
Searching for the truth
I Am
Courageous
I Am (x3)

[Bridge: David Correy & Tokio Hotel]
I Am, I Am, I Am
I Am, I Am, I Am
Worth It
We are who we are, we are (x2)
We are what we say
I Am (x3) What I say
I Am

[Hook: Wyclef Jean & Rock Mafia]
I Am
Searching for the truth
I Am
Perfect
I Am (x3)
What I say
I Am, I Am
Blessed beyond belief
I Am
Perfect
I Am (x3)
What I say I am
