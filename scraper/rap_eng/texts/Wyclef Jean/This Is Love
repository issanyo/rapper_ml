Mi say, sometimes we say so much
That all the words just lose their touch
And what we mean to say never gets in anyway
Before we go too far, before I lose myself
I better say, I never loved nobody else

We been fighting for all the wrong stuff
We better fight to stay in love
We better fight to stay in love, yo
I hear you girl

Yeah, sometimes she say things I just can't dislike
You know, I'm a man, I gotta defend my pride
I wanna to pull her close and hold her through the night
But when I open up my mouth, yeah
The wrong words just come out, yeah

Baby girl, we been fighting for the wrong stuff
If we gonna fight, we should fight to stay in love

This is love, nobody ever hurt me so bad, yeah
This is love though you get on my nerves
This is love, you're my man and I'm your girl
This is love that makes me know you're the only one in my world

L O V E, yeah, Y O U, you don't know say mi luv you too
Next time before you slam the door
And go out for a walk, baby can't you listen?
Can't you listen when I talk?

And if ever you should cry and feel so insecure
I'm a dry your eyes 'cause you worth so much more, yeah
