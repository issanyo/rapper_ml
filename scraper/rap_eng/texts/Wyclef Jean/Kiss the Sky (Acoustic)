[Intro]
Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
Shottas in the basement party
Turned into the greatest party
Never seen my baby coming
Just one hit and we went up
Am I in love or tripping
Now I feel my body drifting
Baby girl, she got me lifted
Am I addicted?

[Chorus]
She's so fly
Excuse her while she kiss the sky
Excuse her while she kiss the sky
She's so high
Excuse her while she kiss the sky
Excuse her while she kiss the sky

[Verse 1]
Popping, knocking when I met you
Shorty had the long extensions
Told her I'm a bad man
But I only got the best intentions
Rougher, tougher, not a bluffer
I want you to be my lover
We don't have to take it undercover
Just under the covers
Bells are ringing, people singing
Rice is throwing, flower bringing
Ting a ling a ling
The honeymoon is when we going in
I take you to a place that you didn't even know exist
What's your wish
Dinner at the Eiffel tower in Paris, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
Shottas in the basement party
Turned into the greatest party
Never seen my baby coming
Just one hit and we went up
Am I in love or tripping
Now I feel my body drifting
Baby girl, she got me lifted
Am I addicted?

[Chorus]
She's so fly
Excuse her while she kiss the sky
Excuse her while she kiss the sky
She's so high
Excuse her while she kiss the sky
Excuse her while she kiss the sky

[Verse 2]
Jaw dropping when she walking
Kinda thing that happen often
More than just a little happy
Shuttin' down a city block
The latest gear is what she wear
You see that stunner in her ear
Fashion week all year
Throwin' money in the air
I'm just happy with my lady
Other girls they wanna hate her
It come with the territory
Ball players wanna date her
All we got is loyalty
I'm treating you like royalty
I'ma spoil you every day of the week

[Pre-Chorus]
Shottas in the basement party
Turned into the greatest party
Never seen my baby coming
Just one hit and we went up
Am I in love or tripping
Now I feel my body drifting
Baby girl, she got me lifted
Am I addicted?

[Chorus]
She's so fly
Excuse her while she kiss the sky
Excuse her while she kiss the sky
She's so high
Excuse her while she kiss the sky
Excuse her while she kiss the sky

[Bridge]
Oh, oh
Excuse her while she kiss the sky
Oh, oh, oh

[Chorus]
She's so fly
Excuse her while she kiss the sky
Excuse her while she kiss the sky
She's so high
Excuse her while she kiss the sky
Excuse her while she kiss the sky
