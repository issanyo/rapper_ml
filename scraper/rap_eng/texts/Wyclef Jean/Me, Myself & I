In a lot of ways, nothing's changed
A different chapter with the same old story
I don't mean to play his games
Bein' alone has never felt so lonely
Who can I run to when you're not home?
Where can I hide from what I've become?
I hate being alone with my thoughts
Baby, please don't be gone for too long
See outside our love, you got plenty of friends
But I only got you
So I pretend
That I'm alright
Yeah, it's alright

[Chorus]
It's just me, myself and I
Cause I owe you the best of times
Though I'm empty, the cup is filled with plenty
It's just me, myself and I
As the night passes me by
I just sit here
Hoping I face my fears

In a lot of ways you're solid gold
Love like a flower, give it time and it'll grow
Under pressure you hold up your end for me
You're the reason I'm home

Who can I talk to when you're not around?
You know I hate all the weight I make you carry around
Wish that I wasn't this way
But you tell me that it's all ok
Sometimes I think that you're too good for me
But you tell me I'm crazy
If only I could see how you see me, how you see me

[Chorus]
It's just me, myself and I
Cause I owe you the best of times
Though I'm empty, the cup is filled with plenty
It's just me, myself and I
As the night passes me by
I just sit here
Hoping I face my fears

And when the days feel long
You keep me holdin' on
But I'm tryin' to learn to let go
And feel alright on my own
Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Chorus]
