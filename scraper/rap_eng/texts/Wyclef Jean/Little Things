[Intro: Wyclef + Allyson Casado]
We need to go back to the way we used to be
Girl I want you back, I want you back, I need you back
We need to go back to the way things used to feel
Boy I want you back, I want you back, I need you back

Erh
I want you back, I want you back, I need you back

[Verse 1: Wyclef Jean]
We went from lovers
To strangers in the night
They came in uniforms
Sirens and the lights
They ask if you’re okay
I just wanna say
I’ll never hurt you babe
Just want you to stay

No vibes when you ain’t around
Clear botchy you’re the jewels in king crown
I reminisce about the fun time
Drink again that’s why the sunrise

No vibes when you ain’t around
Diamond ring go nice with the king crown
Let’s get away and make a lifetime
Silver lining to my lifeline

[Hook: T-Baby]
Oh la la la
I don’t know why we always argue ‘bout the little things
I don’t know if we’ll be forever but I hope that we are
Girl, can we forgive each other for the little things
Don’t let the little things
Get in the way of our love
(Of our love)
Of our love
(Of our love)

[Verse 2: Allyson Casado + Wyclef Jean]
Time and time ma fa give but you cheat again (gain)
Tell me how I know that you really changed (changed)
Should I move on from a new friend (friend)
But I can’t get my eyes on a new man

Do you like what you see
‘Cause I love when you tell me I should put it on you, yeh
And I like what I hear
When you tell me sweat lies that I’m the only one, boy

Imagine that you give me three wishes
The love, the hugs, and the kisses
We pilot the island in the tropics
And that’s how you handle the impulses

[Hook: T-Baby]
Oh la la la
I don’t know why we always argue ‘bout the little things
I don’t know if we’ll be forever but I hope that we are
Girl, can we forgive each other for the little things
Don’t let the little things
Get in the way of our love

[Bridge: Wyclef Jean]
Let me talk to the girl them
You the water when fire hurts
You the reason why the empress comes first
On the beach, we release in me fireworks
Breakup, makeup, now let’s make this work

[Hook: T-Baby]
Oh la la la
I don’t know why we always argue ‘bout the little things
I don’t know if we’ll be forever but I hope that we are
Girl, can we forgive each other for the little things
Don’t let the little things
Get in the way of our love
