[Verse 1: Wyclef Jean]
Invincible emotion
Look alive, look alive
Surrender to the ocean
You could dive, you could dive
But you waiting for the
Just waiting for the
One moment you could
Fall but you might fly
So you holding on the edge
For dear life
Take a dive, take a dive (dive)

[Pre-Hook: Nicholas Petricca]
And this is how I know it’s right
A fire sign
With diamonds eyes
Can we not press rewind
(Don’t let this be over)

And this is how I pass the time
Demonized, that you are mine
Can we not press rewind
(Don’t let this be over)

[Hook: Wyclef Jean + Nicholas Petricca]
I’m holding on the edge
The feeling I can’t let go
I’m holding on the edge
Your secrets that I want to know
We moving through the red
(Moving through the red lights)
It’s coming in the air tonight
I’m holding on the edge
(Don’t let this be over)

[Verse 2: Nicholas Petricca]
Invincible emotion
I could die, I could die
From your poison and your potions
Every night, Every night
We be waiting for the
Just waiting for the
One moment we could
Fall but we might fly
So we holding on the edge
One last time

Eh, she takes a dive, takes a dive
That’s how she knows it’s right

[Pre-Hook: Nicholas Petricca]
And this is how I know it’s right
A fire sign
With diamonds eyes
(Oh, yo yo)
Can we not press rewind
(Don’t let this be over)
Don’t let this be over

And this is how I pass the time
Between the nights
When you are mine
Can we not press rewind
(Don’t let this be over)

[Hook: Wyclef Jean + Nicholas Petricca]
I’m holding on the edge
The feeling I can’t let go
I’m holding on the edge
Your secrets that I want to know
We moving through the red
(Moving through the red lights)
It’s coming in the air tonight
I’m holding on the edge
(Don’t let this be over)

Don’t let this
Don’t let this
Don’t let this be over (2x)

[Hook: Wyclef Jean + Nicholas Petricca]
I’m holding on the edge
The feeling I can’t let go
I’m holding on the edge
Your secrets that I want to know
We moving through the red
(Moving through the red lights)
It’s coming in the air tonight
I’m holding on the edge (2x)

Don’t let this
Don’t let this
Don’t let this be over (3x)
