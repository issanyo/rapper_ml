Aiyyo the lighter we waan see some lighter mami
And tell your company, easy or he gonna turn duppy, whoa
Mr. Sandman he don't wanna get wet
If the, more he drinks, the tougher he gets
If the dance too nice I ain't tryin to fight man
Better to cope than your body on ice man
But I got big plans I'm tryin to buy an island
But the only island dem waan mi own is Riker's Island
Ticky ticky tock the Jacob keep tickin
I tried to warn him but he didn't wanna listen
Said the wolves on the streets tell the children beware
And if your live in the club fire finger in the air
