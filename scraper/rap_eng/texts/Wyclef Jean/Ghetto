[Intro - Trae Tha Truth]
Yea
Hol' Up
In the Ghetto
I can't tell you about you, but I can tell you something about me

[Verse 1 - Trae Tha Truth]
I got this chopper with me
Slidin' through the city, sippin something heavy
Fuck around and catch a body
Body me a nigga, tell them hoes steady
Ready for whatever, father helpful times
Many niggas outta line
Got a 40 pulled up to my waist
The other peace I need I couldn't find
[?] I could rewind it
Pain and hurt don't remind it
I'm fightin' knowin' nothin' promise
I'm close as hell but still can't time it
Just ridin' trying to make it home
That's real life, fuck this song
My sons know they daddy good
And they feel it so they call my phone
I can't answer, so I gotta pray
Shit I don't wanna die today
Fuck niggas might just try today
But I know I'll let a [?]
Forever in the hell hole
Go right beside your head hoe
I'm a asshole to the dissers
Tell them haters I say hello

[Chorus - Ink]
In the ghetto, some got hard on me
In the ghetto, only place I feel free
In the ghetto, livin' these ghetto dreams
In the ghetto, survive by any means

[Verse 2 - T.I.]
We live by any means
Forever, we gon' stand for some or fall for anything
Whenever we pull up get turnt up
Don't concern unless it plenty green
And Hennessy, we blowin' presidential Kennedy
Remember me I had a bomb in da cut
Had a Glock on my hip
Was trappin' the police pull up
No talkin' or hoppin' the fence
Fresh outta' jail gotta open case
I'm dodgin' prison but I'm trappin payin my probation
I know my mama wish I focused on my education
And I do too, but that ain't gon' get us off of Section 8
Know where we stay, no opportunity
See what they did to Freddie Gray they'd love to do to me
But I can't let them bitches play me, nu-uh

[Chorus - Ink]
In the ghetto, some got hard on me
In the ghetto, only place I feel free
In the ghetto, livin' these ghetto dreams
In the ghetto, survive by any means

[Verse 3 - Wyclef Jean]
Ghetto where I come from
Slumdog Millionaire slums
But we diamonds in the rough, son
We keep a 9 for protection, ay
And you can never judge me, cuz you never been there
In the middle of the night, when the enemies appear
Ghetto where we come from
Where death is not an option, tonight
Even though I said someone please call 911
Cops was too late
I had no time to wait
I'm at another wake
Another product face, lord

[Chorus - Ink]
In the ghetto, some got hard on me
In the ghetto, only place I feel free
In the ghetto, livin' these ghetto dreams
In the ghetto, survive by any means
