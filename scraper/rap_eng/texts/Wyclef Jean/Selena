Check it out
Right now if you got problem
With the immigration
Please report on the dance floor
True story, I got my green card
In my hand right now
Let me see them lighters up in the air
As I reminisce
Oh ×6
I reminisce I reminisce
(here's another one)
Oh ×6

Clef
Things done changed but they stay
The same
You can fake that swagga
But can't fake the name
Cuz I got the slang to make the chitty
Bang bang
Bidi Bidi Bom Bom, Bidi Bidi Bom Bom
That's when I asked Melissa
"What's that song?"
She said, "That's Selena playing
All night long."
I said "Where you from?" She said
"Mexico."
We got that Bidi Bidi Bom Bom
Bidi Bidi Bom Bom

Chorus
Bidi Bidi Bom Bom, Oh Selena
Bidi Bidi Bom Bom, Oh Selena
Bidi Bidi Bom Bom, Bidi (Bidi Bom)
She got that fire
(Bidi Bidi Bom Bom), Mexicana
(Mexicana)
(Bidi Bidi Bom Bom)
Raised in America (Oh)
I wish I had a chance to meet her
Bidi Bidi (Bom) Selena
I Reminisce, I Reminisce

Melissa
A yo Clef let me get that balia
I'm a shimmy shimmy on while you sip
Tequila
Manos arriba reppin latinas
With the Bidi Bidi Bom Bom
Bidi Bidi Bom Bom
Selena brought pride to a generation
Inspiration is the hope
For the immigration
I can still hear your voice
Echoing through my system
With the Bidi Bidi Bom Bom
Bidi Bidi Bom Bom

Chorus

And when the heavens open I saw
Selia Cruz
I heard her say "Asucar turn this on."
Tito Puente's dressed in white
Playing timbales while the angels
Sing with Selena
Ay Mamma. Is you carnival shoes on

Reggaeton Breakdown
Parese que va llover
El cielo se esta nulando
Parese que va llover
Ay mamma me estoy mojando

East Coast West Coast Mid-West
PRESENTE!
Dirty South Texas PRESENTE!
Windows stay tinted like a president
PRESENTE!
So drop the gas price Mr.President
Where the latinos? Presente
Itilanos? Presente
Carribenos? Presente
Africanos? Presente
Centro Americanos? Presente
Cubanos? Presente
Mexicanos? Presente

Chorus

Selena forever
For all my immigrants out there
Ima play that electric guitar, let's go
