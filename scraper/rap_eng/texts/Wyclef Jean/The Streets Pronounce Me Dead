The return of the hip hop ammadeus
Wyclef Toussaint St. Jean drama

Streets pronounce me dead
Streets pronounce me dead
Streets pronounce me dead
Streets pronounce me dead
Streets pronounce me dead
Streets pronounce me dead

I tell 'em I'm alive but rumor says I'm dead
The resurrection of the dead, I could never get
And if I ever die, all I do is ride

The streets pronounce me dead
Puttin' two holes in my head
At the funeral, I had more friends than the grateful dead
Haters started talkin' sayin' I went left

Akon took my spot, will.i.am took my vest
Started beatin' on the coffin 'cause I could hear the crowd
But they can't hear me 'cause Lil' Jon's preachin' too loud
That's when the bishop said last words for friends and family

Then the fans stood up and said y'all forgot the Fugees
Fifty million records sold straight from the basement
How y'all gon' tell me Wyclef is irrelevant
A rapper stood up and said, yup I got amnesia
Last time I remember him was Gone 'til November

He said I don't spit no more, all I do is sing songs
Last time he felt me was when I rhymed with Big Pun
That's right get the hate off ya chest
You a rap con artist, not a Kanye West
(I ain't dead)

Streets pronounce me dead
Streets pronounce me dead
Streets pronounce me dead
Streets pronounce me dead
Streets pronounce me dead
Streets pronounce me dead

I tell 'em I'm alive but rumor says I'm dead
The resurrection of the dead, I could never get
And if I ever die, all I do is ride

I mean the streets say it's been a while since they heard me spit
That I spit so hard, my ghostwriter must be cannabis
But far permit, this is how I started
But my battle raps couldn't get me groceries from the super market
So I found another target to aim at

I went from food stamps to the black a mac's
Eight track cassettes, the CD's, the iPod's
Bmx bixes, the hoopdies, the hot rods
And my swag come from Nazareth

How you gon' say I'm dead when I rose like Lazareth
And this ain't mystic, I ain't talkin' voodoo
We do carry spears like the Zulu's
So watch your mouth boy, I ain't dead

Fo' the city gon' turn red, blood will shed
So before you speak boy watch your tone
Fo' my chrome gon' turn you to a statue of stone
(I ain't dead)

Streets pronounce me dead
Streets pronounce me dead
Streets pronounce me dead
Streets pronounce me dead
Streets pronounce me dead
Streets pronounce me dead

I tell 'em I'm alive but rumor says I'm dead
The resurrection of the dead, I could never get
And if I ever die, all I do is ride

They all got shocked when I rose from the coffin
Dust my self off then headed out to new Jerusalem
Destroyed and rebuilt, my voice sound like silk
Audio tune like milk, I used to shop lift with no guilt

And Christmas time toy guns the size of elves
I seen the ra-ta-ta-ta turn into the real shells
Yup killa, you press ya luck
Went to sleep in the pond, woke up with the ducks

And this ain't gangsta talk, I don't talk the talk
I suggest you walk or get outlined in chalk
And you ain't from the street
But yet you walk the streets
You a C, O, P, a cop walkin' the beat

But the rule on the streets they could turn on you
Like a pit bull after givin' him food
Or the girl that you bought all the cars and the jewels
Only to find out on memorial dey fuckin' in the swimmin' pool
(I ain't dead)

Streets pronounce me dead
Streets pronounce me dead
Streets pronounce me dead
Streets pronounce me dead
Streets pronounce me dead
Streets pronounce me dead

I tell 'em I'm alive but rumor says I'm dead
The resurrection of the dead, I could never get
And if I ever die, all I do is ride

Yea
Warriors music
Drama
From the hut, to the projects, to the mansions
So y'all know you, y'all ain't got no excuses
I'm alive

Wyclef aka Toussaint St Jean
