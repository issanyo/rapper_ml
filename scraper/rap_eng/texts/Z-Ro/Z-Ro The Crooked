[Z-Ro]
The swisher papers got me dying so I practice smoking squares
And I see death around the corner so I'm quick to say a prayer
Living my life on the corner with thugs selling my drugs known as a chiller
But push my button watch your life cause I transform to a killer
Me sipping the drink me smoking me dank me tipping me herb and formaldehyde
Open it all of me niggas are ready to ride
Could I be innocent till proved guilty by Judge Judy
But the fact remains, they confiscated my weed and my uzi
Now I'm in correctional facilities, living raw
Sharing a cell with the niggas that I whupped on in the free world
But ain't a god damn thing changed I'm still breaking a jaw
Ain't fin to lose no sleep, over nan one of y'all, one of y'all with fours
Could run up on me, and I guarantee that one of y'all gonna fall
I'm just here to do my time, not to trouble you, but I'mma drop
These jealous haters until they hear 1-9-3-2-0-7-0-6-8-T-W
In the free world one more god damn gin, causing havoc and fury
I'ma be popping pills, smoking that kill and for the members of the jury
Cause vengeance is mine, but I'm locked down, feeling forsaken
And my pen is mightier than the sword because my tools have been taken
Straight from the streets of Houston Texas yes my freedom they took it
But motherfuckers can't take my will to survive nigga
I'm Z-Ro the Crooked

(Chorus)
In the wicked world, here come the champion, look out, look out
Abra cadabra, and running with the gun in me hand, look out, look out

[Z-Ro]
Hallucinations are tricking me, making me think I'm about to die
Could it be that fire that somebody really have a 3-54 plus three pointed at me
They giving me stitch of rectangles and squares
Asking me what does this mean to me
But I'm ready for the combat give me my motherfucking law back
Bitch I don't want no needles in me, y'all thinking I mean it, trying to do me
In a room full of ever men taking my mind to a place that I never been
But I'm a soldier roamed the battlefield, in the middle of the war
You either have to die or have to kill, so I ain't guilty motherfucker
Raise up off of my N-U-T's, cause you can't harm me
Everlasting, I'm ever blasting I recking you better get the army to swarm me
Because the Indonesia canibus helps me tackle the pain
But I'm getting so weak because I'm shackled in chains
Now my brain is going insane, feeling like my spirit is about to get evicted
Cause I'm a victim of a world so wicked, time and time
I ask myself why did they turn the heat up, I was chasing paper
But niggas was jealous because they couldn't keep up
I'm Z-Ro the Crooked

(talking)
I ain't ditching old punk ass nigga
Look in my motherfucking eyes nigga
Till I die, I'mma be real

[Z-Ro]
Show me a mercy overwhelmed in deep distress
Although I realize it's nothing but a test, but I can't take it
Cause my brain is going insane lately, see how many
Enemies that I have and how viscously they hate me
Deliver my life from they power forgive my sins, see my sorrow, feel my pain
Let it never be said I trusted you in vein
Long as I'm walking this earth my problems go from bad to worse
And I know it's gonna be that way until they lower my casket in the dirt
But all I'm asking for is just a little piece of mind, and I know
That if I keep the faith it shouldn't be hard for me to find
But my mind is hard to turn the other cheek, could of been a wise man
Because of the revelation of scripture that I speak
Everyday for twenty motherfucking years
A nigga been facing so many fears, and nothing shedding so many tears
But dear Sandra don't cry, all I can say is if they kill me I took it
But even in death I'm victorious they couldn't fade me
I'm Z-Ro the Crooked
