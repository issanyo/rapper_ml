They like, "What ya doing? Why ya still here?"
I'm like, "[? 0:15]"
Forgot about trends, I [? 0:18] I did here
This grown man music, you popular with the kids here
Yeah, I put on like Jeezy 'nem
If they help me put on, ya know I'm feedin' them
If they roaching, you would never ever see me with them
And if I tell her, "Come with me!", you know she leaving him
I'm just saying, look, I got it like that
Yeah, the haters took it from me, but I got it right back
If you got some bitch up in ya, I'ma spot it like that
If the bag ain't heavy, well, then it's not the right bag, yeah

[Pre-Hook]
Laughing at these haters tryna block my shine
Always tryna act like it's not my time
Why you worried 'bout my nickels, and 'bout my dime?
They might lock away my body, but can't lock my mind

[Hook]
I don't owe you niggas shit, kids (I don't owe you niggas shit)
I don't owe you niggas shit, kids (I don't owe you niggas shit)

[Verse 2]
What ya want, homie? I don't owe shit, bitch

Now, ya mad at me, huh? I'm on ya shit list
Do it then, and what you get is this foot and this fist
[? 1:24] in the kitchen, he just sealing the deal
I'm in my home, countin' money, it's a million for real
I'm a boss, but I hustle like I'm still in the field
If I say "Fuck you!", I ain't playing, bitch, the feeling is real
'Cause I'm swimming pool cool, I don't trip like that
You gon' make a nigga empty out a clip like that
You don't want a see that body bag zipped like that
What I'm repping? Screwed Up Click, Hoover Crip like that

[Verse 3]
They asking Johnny what I spent on my chain
And how many karats, what kind of diamonds in this ring
Did he make payments or did he drop all the change?
Probably wanna know if I wear Polo drawers or Hanes
Would ya look at that house? I know he ain't doing bad
"Can I get a hundred dollars?" They see me, that's what they ask
Smell like some Reggie, they see me, that's what they pass
I be like, "Damn, y'all must really be doing bad!"
But that ain't my bidness, I got shit to do
You already know I ain't giving shit to you
And to my money, baby, I ain't really into you
Drop you off and go get money, that's what I'm fin to do

[Pre-Hook]
Laughing at these haters tryna block my shine
