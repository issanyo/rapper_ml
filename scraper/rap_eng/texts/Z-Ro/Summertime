[Verse 1: Z-Ro]
Swangin through the south side last night baby
You know that I was coming from my trap
Accompanied by a couple sexy ladies
And a couple paint bottles in my lap
And I have never swung this wide
Like future, I lost my mind and my top at the same time

[Hook: Z-Ro]
Ten, eleven slabs in a single file line (summertime)
Pocket full of money (that's how we do it in the summer time)
All those players got a bad ass woman on their side (summertime)
And the diamonds ain't monkey (yeah)

Summertime in my city
Ain't nobody tripping
Summertime in my city
We just smoking and sipping
Summertime in my city
Ain't nothing but love
Summertime in my city
Every hood is like a club

[Verse 2: Slim Thug]
Thugga
It's summertime in my city man
It's a bunch of fine dimes looking pretty man
I'm trying to take a few with me man
Hoping HPD don't come get me man
You know it's poured up
You know it's throwed up
It ain't a summer Slim Thug ain't showed up
Spend a mansion with Johnny make gold go up
Everywhere we go everybody know us
Hood superstars
Like candy on our cars
When you see them fours you gonna know it's those Texas boys
It's summertime in the city
Time to show up
We hit the club
Watch how many bottles blow up

[Hook: Z-Ro]
Ten, eleven slabs in a single file line  (summertime)
Pocket full of money (that's how we do it in the summer time)
All those players got a bad ass woman on their side (summertime)
And the diamonds in the teeth (yeah)

Summertime in my city
Ain't nobody tripping
Summertime in my city
We just smoking and sipping
Summertime in my city
Ain't nothing but love
Summertime in my city
Every hood is like a club

[Verse 3: Z-Ro]
Okay everybody know I will kill
But it seems like my haters done took a chill pill
Even the ones that's real fakers that can real real
The way the bass whipping my styrofoam I know it will spill

[Verse 4: Slim Thug]
The pool party hopping got them steaks on the grill
Whole hood participating nobody getting killed
Just a bunch of real niggas trying to smoke and chill
Chopping it up trying to plot up another meal

[Verse 5: Z-Ro & Slim Thug]
Shot all your money, homey don't worry about that
What the fuck you think a real nigga for, I got that
Galleria, we shop that, gotta stay fresh for summer
Throw the slab trunk beating like a drummer

[Hook: Z-Ro]
Ten, eleven slabs in a single file line  (summertime)
Pocket full of money (that's how we do it in the summer time)
All those players got a bad ass woman on their side (summertime)
And the diamonds in the teeth (yeah)

Summertime in my city
Ain't nobody tripping
Summertime in my city
We just smoking and sipping
Summertime in my city
Ain't nothing but love
Summertime in my city
Every hood is like a club
