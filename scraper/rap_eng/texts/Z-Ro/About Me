[Intro]
Free C-Murder
Free BG
Matter fact, free all my niggas from Angola to TDC
All them penitentiaries around the world
We gon' turn up though
We don't give a fuck what these niggas heard about us
If it ain't real, we ain't rockin' with that shit like a cut-off sock in wit' this shit

[Chorus]
I don't give a fuck what you heard about me
If it ain't real, don't believe a word about me
That's a meal, lil nigga, that'll murder 'bout me
Have a home goin' for ya in the church about me (Ayy)
I don't give a fuck what you heard about me
If it ain't real, don't believe a word about me (Ayy)
Woman, get yo ass up, you gotta work around me
All I'm tryna do is make that thing squirt around me (Ayy)

[Verse 1]
Ah, these niggas trippin, they don't like the way I shake hands
You niggas nasty as fuck so I don't shake hands
So get them shits away from me or I'll break hands
Don't make me punch ya in the face and make you break dance
'Cause I am not friendly, I am not friendly
Me against the world, that's that 2Pac in me (West Side)
They mad at me 'cause I ain't take them to the top with me
Pardon me, I'm by myself, they are not with me
They wanna put some shots in me, but it ain't drank
So many people fuckin' with me, man I can't-can't
No matter how fine the bitch is I can't-can't
"No Kiki, do you love me?" I ain't Drake
That's my nigga though
Me, I'm just that nigga Ro
For 20 years straight, I had rack then a [?]
Always somewhere you never ever get to go
If DJ Eric one bitch, they betta hit the flo

[Chorus]
I don't give a fuck what you heard about me
If it ain't real dope, don't believe a word about me
That's a meal, lil nigga, that'll murder 'bout me
Have a home goin' for ya in the church about me (Ayy)
I don't give a fuck what you heard about me
If it ain't real, don't believe a word about me (Ayy)
Woman, get yo ass up, you gotta work around me
All I'm tryna do is make that thing squirt around me (Ayy)

[Verse 2]
You got a problem with me, lemme know nigga
You ain't gon' say shit to me, then let it go nigga
Find out ya plottin' on me, ain't gon' let it go nigga
Pull up right beside you in traffic and let it go nigga
One deep, no crew in this bitch
They will never let a nigga like you in this bitch
What's a line? I be walkin' right through in this bitch
[?] mechanic so you know I got my crew in this bitch
So if you accidentally step on my shoe in this bitch
I ain't trippin', I ain't got nothin' to prove in this bitch
Not tryna to be on the 10 o'clock news in this bitch
That'll violate my probation and ruin this shit
So they say I ain't down with my people like I'm supposed to be
I just know better than to let a nigga get close to me
Beggin' me for mine, get yo mine, you a hoe to me
I get it by myself so I ball, that's what I'm supposed to see

[Chorus]
I don't give a fuck what you heard about me
If it ain't real dope, don't believe a word about me
That's a meal, lil nigga, that'll murder 'bout me
Have a home goin' for ya in the church about me (Ayy)
I don't give a fuck what you heard about me
If it ain't real, don't believe a word about me (Ayy)
Woman, get yo ass up, you gotta work around me
All I'm tryna do is make that thing squirt around me (Ayy)

I don't give a fuck what you heard about me
If it ain't real dope, don't believe a word about me
That's a meal, lil nigga, that'll murder 'bout me
Have a home goin' for ya in the church about me (Ayy)
I don't give a fuck what you heard about me
If it ain't real, don't believe a word about me (Ayy)
Woman, get yo ass up, you gotta work around me
All I'm tryna do is make that thing squirt around me (Ayy)
