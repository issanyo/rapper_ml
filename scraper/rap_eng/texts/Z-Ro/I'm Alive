[Verse 1]
I am, the type of nigga that brang his pistol in the club
I am, the type of nigga your baby daddy wish he was
I am, the type of nigga that don’t know how to give a fuck
The type of nigga that will tell the whole club, fuck the whole club

Fuck a state trooper, fuck a sheriff, fuck a sergeant and fuck a deputy
Man fuck the police, I'll be yelling that shit until it ain’t no more breath left in me
One deep for life until the casket closes, if I ain’t ready kick my casket open
Y’all heard what I said: I’m back from the dead; they killed me last night but I’m here this morning
These niggas ain’t gon' hold me back
All these niggas, yeah, they owe me stacks
Where the hell that nigga li'l Sam Weathers?
Chop his ass down and leave em like that
I dare a nigga-- air a nigga, like what the fuck is backing down
I come down yo' block and unload this uzi, reload that bitch and come back around

[Hook]
I’m alive, I’m alive
The way they try to murder me is like a 9 to 5
But I’m alive, I’m alive
The reverend is a gangster, we got weapons in the choir
I’m alive, I’m alive
If we ever go to war you better hope you on my side
Run up if you want to, I’m gon' hit you with that iron
Now everybody can see what you have on your mind

Listen, these rappers said they got love for me but I’m knowin' they really hate me, though
They be like I’ma get Ro to do the hook but if I let him do a verse, he gon' take the show...
And that’s a no-no, he ain’t stealing my shine....
But how the fuck he 35 and he still in his prime?
I ain’t never been a YG-- I started off as a OG in this motherfucker
And I never heard "What’s your name?" 'cause everybody know me in this motherfucker
It ain’t just no rap-- I really be where the coke be in this motherfucker
Try to rob me, bitch, I’ma shoot your lights out; I’m Kobe in this motherfucker
I murder this microphone and put your pro tools in a chokehold
Styrofoam after styrofoam and I’m smokin' like a broke stove
Go hard on the mic so hard might accidentally give me a broke nose
I'm a Vicodin/cocaine/X-pill and your favorite rapper is a No-Doz

[Hook]
I’m alive, I’m alive
The way they try to murder me is like a 9 to 5
But I’m alive, I’m alive
The reverend is a gangster, we got weapons in the choir
I’m alive, I’m alive
If we ever go to war you better hope you on my side
Run up if you want to, I’m gonna hit you with that iron
Now everybody can see what you have on your min
