"Who's the man? Who's the Boss? Who's the nigga that paid the cost?
I really don't give a damn 'cause I ain't the one who's gonna take the loss..."

Verse 1: Mýa
Every single day I appreciate you give me what I want
I know the game done changed but you still remain & you stay posted up, oh, oh
And when the block gets hot you know I got you baby
Until it cools down
I'm gonna stay right here it's forever 'til we both meet the ground
Get yo' money

Verse 2: Mýa
Every other day when it rains it pours
Livin' in the hood
And it's so sexy how you change up the weather report you flip back bad to good, oh, oh
And you just the kinda man I been lookin' for
So I'm a hold you down
And just like Martin needs Coretta, Bonnie needs her Clyde
And that's just what I found
In you, oh, oh

Chorus: Mýa
H U S T L E you know we
Run this city baby
They can't do it like you do
They ain't got it like you do
Boss

On my grind

[Z-Ro:]

On my grind

[Mýa:]

[Verse 3: Z-Ro]
Damn right I'm a hustler baby
I don't move unless it's gon' pay me
I know you wanna see me but I don't know maybe baby
'Cause I'm tryin' to get rich daily
Damn right I'm a Boss & you know that
But when I leave the house I can't wait until I go back
I got a miss of mo' packs to get some more stacks
From Houston & DC but I'll be back
Baby I'll be that
I know you like kutch with no C's in the sack
I'm just playin' wit you baby, but I know you feel that
I'm tryin' to get us a meal, get buck so we can relax
Somewhere but can't nobody find out where we at
Sellin' a 4 & a halves an ounce was the rest
But I'm runnin' this city & can't ? do it like me
'Cause I do it like this, gon' be rich

Chorus: Mýa
H U S T L E you know we
Run this city baby
They can't do it like you do
They ain't got it like you do
Boss
H U S T L E you know we
Run this city baby
They can't do it like you do
They ain't got it like you do
Boss
