[Verse 1]
Everybody know how much hate this world brung out
I guess that’s why babies be screaming when they come out
Minute after minute, struggle can’t take one off
The days is even dark, somebody musta pissed the sun off
Now, how the hell am I supposed to smile at that?
Never understood how boys be cheesin’ when they pockets flat
Can’t help slackers, gotta cut the love off
Hanging ‘round broke people, broke thoughts rubbed off
I don’t do nothing for the sound of applause
The only thing I truly own can be found in my drawers
Frustration and aggravation, what’s the number one cause?
Inside of fake homies, haters, baby-mamas and laws
My own problem, I can’t iron it out
So now I’m crying every night on my psychiatrist’s couch
Going in, thinking ‘bout my dead partners and I teared up
Life is so cold, I watch the news to get cheered up

[Chorus, Z-Ro]
I wish I could smile, baby
Ninety percent of the time, I usually don’t give a f*ck
I’m cool but everybody around me so f*cked up
I say I wish I could smile, baby
Life is a b*tch then you die
Maybe then me and my people can smile

[Verse 2, Z-Ro]
Y’all already know it’s been hard
And sometimes I wanted to die
And since I never been too much of a man to cry
Many days with a face full of water
Stressin’ like I wonder if my daughter really my daughter
[?] IRS done probed all of my bank accounts
[?] I’ma whoop your ass for that, just giving you something to think about
Tampering with evidence and misdemeanor possessions
State troopers treated a ni**a like they saw me with a weapon
Attorney general so greedy, they like, “We need mo’
That’s all you got, Mr. McVey? Ain’t you a CEO?”
It might be easy for you to smile, but you ain’t me
Been on probation since February, but I still ain’t free
2pac said you gotta find a way to smile through the bullsh*t
Otherwise, every ten seconds, you’ll be like, “This some bullsh*t”
I smoke a blunt to take the pain out
And if I wasn’t blessed, I’d probably try to blow my brains out
Smile

[Chorus, Z-Ro]
I wish I could smile, baby
Ninety percent of the time, I usually don’t give a fuck
I’m cool but everybody around me so f*cked up
I say I wish I could smile, baby
Life is a b*tch then you die
Maybe then me and my people can smile

[Verse 3, Klondike Kat]
You ni**as rather see me frowning than smiling and gettin’ it
But I been had the world on my shoulders, I’m a soldier, God is my witness
Better know the street life will turn you out
But if you a street ni**a, that nine-to-five might burn you out
So you thinkin’ of a better way to get cash
Dodging the feds and the [?]
I-10 with a chicken and a dough stack
As the world turns slow, I move fast
X on my back and the penitentiary on my heels
Got me weaving through these snakes, ready to bust the steel
Peel at will, that’s real
So why in the f*ck would I trust y’all haters?
Y’all ain’t ‘bout that gangsta sh*t
You can put my name on some paper
Ain’t no loyalty in you, ain’t no rules that you play by
It’s cutthroat on everybody for the fame and the stay fly
Is you serious? I thank God for the mind that he gave me
To help me navigate the street life and to slip these shadies
[?] keep them snakes back ‘cause they hatin’ is crazy
But I’ma stay forever real until they dirt and they grave me, that’s why I smile
