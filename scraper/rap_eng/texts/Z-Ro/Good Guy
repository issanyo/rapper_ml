[Intro]
(I know) You know
I could never love no bitch
And wherever (I go), you know
Homie I ain't takin' no shit
I'm just tryna have myself a real good time
Smoke a lil' loud and get a real good high
Ain't nobody trippin', it's a real good vibe
I love it when I get the chance to be a good guy

[Verse 1]
With all this shit goin' on right now
I'm happy to be alive and free (Thank you God)
I keep God first and try so hard
But the devil keep on tryin' me
You know it's all good, I'm a soldier
Promise I'ma get ya if I owe ya
Matter fact I ain't trippin' 'cause I'm down with the Lord
I'm gonna chill and let the good Lord show ya
I don't need ya, you ain't gotta rock wit' me, one deep
I do just fine if ain't nobody rollin' wit' me in the front seat
These niggas, these bitches, they be trippin'
I'ma snap, they gon' come up missin'
I love my people, I really do
If you ever kept it real wit' me I salute you

[Verse 2]
Uh
You know I don't fuck with dude
And if you fuck with me he don't fuck with you (That's messed up)
He be talkin' all that gangsta shit
But if he ever see me to face to face
I bet he don't know what to do (Ha, ha, ha)
But I don't want no problem bro (Bro)
If you negative you gotta go (Go)
'Cause I don't need that shit, I done grown up (Shit)
Talk about me like a dog I'm like "so what?" (What)
I got way too many players sayin'
I ain't got no business stressin'
A bitch said this, a nigga said that
Harris County say I can't get my bread back (Damn)
Usually I go off (Off)
Put my fist and my foot in yo mouth (Mouth)
Nowadays that hatin' don't phase me
I can't hear ya unless you sayin' you 'bout to pay me (Ayy)

[Bridge]
If you want that bull shit, bye-bye
I just wanna get fucked up right now
Stress-free I don't need no drama
Homie why you actin' like a baby mama?
One deep that's how I roll
Shout out to burnin', rollin', cookin', then roll (Hey)
Ass up, face down on the flo
It's the only time I'ma beat a hoe
