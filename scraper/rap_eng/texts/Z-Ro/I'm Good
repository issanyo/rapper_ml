[Verse 1]
I don't think I even got to introduce myself
King of the Ghetto that's what they call me
And I don't love no bitch like I love my money
If you ain't green back the fuck up off me
I support my own habit don't need ya to drop half
I'ma get it give a fuck what it cost me
I'm at the Derek on the top floor
Bitch reminding me of Lauryn Hill cause she killing me softly
With some of that mouth
Never made it to the bed, still on the couch
Lil' mama going crazy
Can't take her to the house
Might take her to the trap
Where they coming in and out spending money on the daily
I know a lot of niggas don't like me (So what?)
But guess what
I don't like a lot of niggas though (Fucking right)
They talk shit when they 25 deep
But when I catch them by they self
They don't never say shit to 'Ro

[Chorus]
I got enough going on in my life right now
You can get the fuck out my life right now
I swear to god I might just start shooting
Y'all lucky I'm drunk Y'all lucky I'm high right now
If something happen to me and I die right now
Same nigga say they hate me gon' cry right now
"Man I always had love for 'Ro"
Why your nose growing you telling a lie right now

[Hook]
But bitch I'm good
Bitch I'm good, all I gotta say
Bitch I'm good
I don't give a fuck about you
Bitch I'm good
Cause I don't need ya

[Verse 2]
I got a bitch talking shit
Cause I'm walking through the mall
With a chick that ain't never seen my dick before
No wonder why I'm always like I'm one deep for life
Even though I'm doing right the bitch tripping though
Fuck that relationship shit I don't want to get a long
I guess all I really want to do is get the dough
Cause that relationship shit
Will have my ass in a county jail holding tank
Waiting to hit a floor
Look I don't want to do stress, Id rather do press
Shout out to God cause I know who you bless
I'm a represent for you till my very last breath
Just give me a good life and give me a good death
I talk a lot of shit about some of my baby mommas
But I mean that shit and that's a damn shame
Cause I could put Disneyland in they hands\
Still wouldn't say nothing nice right after they say my damn name (That's fucked up)

[Chorus]
I got enough going on in my life right now
You can get the fuck out my life right now
I swear to god I might just start shooting
Y'all lucky I'm drunk Y'all lucky I'm high right now
If something happen to me and I die right now
Same nigga say they hate me gon' cry right now
"Man I always had love for 'Ro"
Why your nose growing you telling a lie right now

[Hook]
But bitch I'm good
Bitch I'm good, all I gotta say
Bitch I'm good
I don't give a fuck about you
Bitch I'm good
Cause I don't need ya

[Verse 3]
You can keep on talking that shit
And I'ma keep on not even knowing
And I'ma keep on going in expensive places
You can't afford to go in
If you ain't talking bout a goddamn thing you don't need to say nothing no more then
We on that grown man shit over here
It ain't just about dranking and smoking
I love my niggas but I love me more
They just come around and try to get my dough
Fuck that they can get the fuck
And ain't gotta come back no more
Cause they ain't getting shit
If they don't help with the show
Taking care of grown men is a no-no
Then they wonder why I'm the one-man band
I'ma roll solo
Who gives a fuck what they say about me
So far above the ground is where I'll be
I'm so B-L-E-S-S-E-D
Cause I ain't got to worry bout a damn thing
I ain't got to worry bout a thing

[Hook]
Bitch I'm good, Bitch I'm good
All I got to say, Bitch I'm good
I don't give a fuck about you
Bitch I'm good
Cause I don't need you
