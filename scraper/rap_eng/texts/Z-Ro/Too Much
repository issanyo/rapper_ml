[Intro:]
Dang
Fucked up
R&B Thugga

[Chorus:]
I’ve been smoking too much [x3]
Thinking bout you bitch
And I’ve been drinking too much
I’ve been drinking too much
I’ve been drinking too much
Thinking bout you bitch
I’m too player for this shit man

[Verse 1:][Slim Thug]
Thugs never fall in love
We treat bitches like scrubs
When we leave the club
Smash them we pass em to the next
No tricking, no dollars, no checks
Just sex then I’m gone out the door
But babygirl you won’t let a nigga go
She treat me like a king
Making it hard to leave
Give me everything I need
Feed me till I can’t breathe
I’m spending too much time with you
All these home cooked meals
What you tryna do
I’m a player
Selling dimes for suppers
But I ain’t going lie
You one bad motherfucker

[Chorus]

[Verse 2:][Z-Ro]
What the fuck is this
I think she put voodoo on my dick
Cause ain’t feeling the same
When I fuck my other hoes
They ain’t be feeling the same
They tell me it still good
But they be feeling the same
So i’m still striking off
But i ain’t drillin the same
My dick is here
But my mind in another place
Can’t get hard unless I pretend this bitch
Done got another face
Maybe it’s the way she gave me head
From 7:30 to 9 o’clock she gave me head
Had my toes looking like fingers
Imma player but everyday i wanna smash her

[Chorus]

[Verse 3:][Z-Ro]
What part of the game is this
I fell in love with a stripper
Hell yeah i miss her
Bad bitch that’s why
Ain’t too much she won’t try
I bring her friend like I got a surprise
Living the life
Keep a smile on my face
Ass so fat with a small waist
One of the realest bitches ever
All about gettin that cheddar
It’s whatever, whenever
She goin make it happen
All I had to do was say it
She goin make it happen
Next thing I know some boss nigga proposed
I hate it when these niggas get to saving my hoes

[Chorus]

Swag

[Outro:]
It was just really surprising
To see that many people who you
You know… cause like I said
These are my people who I roll with everyday
We did shows
They be kinda grouped up
And kinda boxed me out
So you know
