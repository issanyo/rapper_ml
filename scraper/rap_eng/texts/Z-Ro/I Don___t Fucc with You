I don't fucc with you
Cuz you be actin less than a G
Don't be comin round here messin with me
I don't fucc with you
Cuz you always up to no good
They don't even fucc with you in your hood
I don't fucc with you
Cuz you always runnin your mouth
About something you know nothing about
I don't fucc with you
Always hating me I still don't mind
No matter what you say or what you do
I'm still gon shine

She's no longer welcome
In the bed at a nigga crib
So she been throwing eggs
At a nigga crib
I'm really flattered you would do that
Just cuz you can't give me no head
Or open your legs at a nigga crib
Never gon be a bitch
I'm gon tolerate that shit from
Bet ya I ain't the hoe ass nigga
She gettin dick from
Talkin to a man like he ain't no man
Make me open my pimp hand
Like it ain't gon land
I ain't fuckin with that
That thot like attitude
I ain't fuckin with that
Then got the nerve to ask me for something
You gets nothing with that
When we see her comin
We be like, there she go
Act like she better than everybody
Everywhere she go

[Hook]

Watchin my pocket
Like I owe your grown ass something
You ain't write none of my shit for me
I don't owe your ass nothing
You got the same two feet and two hands I got
And that mean you got the same opportunity I got
Look you can't borrow shit
And you can't spend the night at my spot
Cuz I don't wanna wake up
Like where my necklace and my watch
Always begging but when I say no
You be like rich niggas ain't fuckin with the hood no more
I can't stand these niggas
Like I'm sitting down
Used to be cool
I want you to keep your distance now
Playing with Z-Ro
I bet you'll get what's coming to you
Breaking your face is what the fuck I'm a do
