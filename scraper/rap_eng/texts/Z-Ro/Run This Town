[Chorus]
All you got to do is keep it real with me
And baby we can run this town
Come through and shut shit down
Ain't know who you fuck with now
All you got to do is keep it real with me
And baby we can run this town
Come through and shut shit down
Ain't know who you fuck with now

[Verse 1]
Since I woke up this morning I had to thank my savior
For letting me see another day to chase my paper
They outnumber me but I love to face my haters
Thousand dollars that's the type of shit I pay my waiter
Baby girl with me looking like a bag of money
Sitting right next to me but she's still asking for me here baby here I go what you want though
And where we going ain't nowhere this plane don't go
Nothing like my last bitch she was just so so
First class attitude but she was just a coach hoe
But I'm digging you like a snow shovel in Alaska
Got me feeling like the endless nigga in Nebraska
A hell of a night and a hell of a morning after
It's so good I'm like why is it me she going after
Don't know if it's because I'm balling the night
But she make me feel good like I'm a falling tonight

[Chorus]
All you got to do is keep it real with me
And baby we can run this town
Come through and shut shit down
Ain't know who you fuck with now
All you got to do is keep it real with me
And baby we can run this town
Come through and shut shit down
Ain't know who you fuck with now

[Verse 2]
They say they closed but for me they goin' open up
They be like there Z-Ro and obey gon show us love
Your friend be tripping wishing she can go with us
Two is company three's a problem we don't need no mo' with us
You can't fuck with these hoes but I fuck with you
If you lost for me but now you know what the fuck to do
You know I come from a different cult I'm not that other dude
I'm ain't the type to do and then say look what I've done for you
Look I don't need to do it for the Gram baby
And I don't need to say my name y'all already who I am baby
Don't be afraid to take my hand baby
Fucked up when I hub with you
I fucked all for 100 grams baby
See through waters and white sand baby
You know I just get up and go I'm not the one to make plans baby
And if you cheat on a nigga I ain't gon go off
I'm gonna pick up your sister and Ima drive her from your house

[Chorus]
All you got to do is keep it real with me
And baby we can run this town
Come through and shut shit down
Ain't know who you fuck with now
All you got to do is keep it real with me
And baby we can run this town
Come through and shut shit down
Ain't know who you fuck with now
