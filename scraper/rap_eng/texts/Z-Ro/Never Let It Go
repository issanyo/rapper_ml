Say Mike D. Dig these blues...
Here I go again, runnin' off at the mouth about buster's
Muthafucker's just mad at me 'cause they diamonds ain't up in cluster's
Too many times I done paid my dues
Even today I'm still payin' 'em fool
"Could it be the reason I'm so cold in the rap game is muthafuckin' pain!"
I'm screamin' "Jesus, I need a better way of life!"
'Cause at the rate I travel now, I can't decide a day from night
Still the King of The Ghetto, the ghetto is where I lay my head at, evade feds at & break bread at
These some of my bitches got a nigga fucked up, my attitude is already rude
And too many people make me paranoid, so I'll wet a bitch & I'll wet a dude
Straight like that I don't give a damn I'm Gangstafied, from toe to head, enough said
Flippin' in a gangsta ride & when it get gangsta, a gangsta will bust heads
It's in my blood, I'm a muthafuckin' thug, even though I know better
My only love is for my gorillas & for the cheddar
So all you mark ass niggas get the fuck up outta dodge
Get your life right with God, then if you want war let's go to war!

[Z-Ro:]
It be a bunch of drama on my block, my partner accidentally shot his mama on my block
Tryin' to survive in the Land Of The Lost, hopin' I can at least find me
'Cause back in high school ain't now one of my teachers reached me
I wasn't cuttin' up in class, I had money on my mind
Visualizin' a muthafuckin' come up, ready to get up & grind
Chasin' paper like a muthafucker, me & buddy Ro, movin' ounce after ounce after ounce of that yayo
Makin' money what I love to do, but my freedom is pendin' & if I get caught slippin' my freedom is endin' nigga I'm playin' it safe
100's & 50's & 20's & 10's & 5's, some 1's up in my safe, 357 & a .40 & a .44 up in my waist a maniac
Trigger happy & don't give a fuck what I be aimin' at
Ridgemont for live forever I'm claimin' that. Ridgemont for live forever I'm claimin' that

[Z-Ro:]
My niggas be killin' each other behind these busted bitches
I would rather be spendin' my time in a drop top, somethin' out on switches
With a sack of that shit, so I can calm my nerves down
Dealin' with bitch nigga after bitch nigga I'm ready to release rounds
Out of the mini .14 I'm a shoot 'til it's over with, ain't nobody gon' stud up
Another one bites the dust, I'm throwin' that pud up. Nigga what?
I'm ready to kill & I'm ready to die for 'cause for my life
The reason why I'm anti-social & built a way around my life
Ain't nobody but me
Z-Ro The Crooked in the flesh
Mo' City Texas ain't no fashion show, niggas come here & meet death
It'll be a battleground with nothin' but dead enemies of myself
'Cause when I be clickin' I be feelin' a strange energy within' myself
I never be givin' a damn about it because it be feelin' so live
So when I be doin' that there, don't fuck with me & take me outta my vibe, nigga
10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4 never gonna let the game go... fo' sho'
