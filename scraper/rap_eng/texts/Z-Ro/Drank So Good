[Hook]
And it tastes so good
And it tastes so good
And it tastes so good
And it tastes so good

[Verse 1]
And it tastes so good
Every God damn day
I roll through the hood
Mo City or that MLK
My gun on my side
No games I'mma play
If they run up on my ride
They gone say may-day
I'm in love with a 20 ounce big (?)
With a three up in that bitch
Some of ya'll say I'm a drank head
I drink a straight 4-5 zips
And I guess I really am
But I don't give a damn
Boys be puttin' deuces in two liters, ya'll disrespecting the game
Big I'mma buy a one liter and try to pour up an eight

[Hook]
And it tastes so good
And it tastes so good
And it tastes so good
And it tastes so good

[Verse 2]
Man my cup so heavy I gotta tell ya
It's a beast when you put a four in a Dr. Pepper
Hey, now I'm leanin' to the left, to the left
Hope I'm not trippin' I need to check myself
Pour up a four, a five, or an eight man
Hold your cup tight, you know I got the base man
When that bass bang they think it's a drive by
That's why motherfuckers be duckin' when I ride by
Even when I bust my gun my cup won't spill
You better hope you on my side or your guts gone spill
Where the bad bitches? So far it's just some mutts in here
At two o'clock women leave and they left the sluts in here
(?) lil mamma, you can keep that
Money hungry ass bitch gone make me reach back
I ain't worried about you ho, I'm too busy showin' up
And everybody with me pourin' up, yeah

[Hook]
And it tastes so good
And it tastes so good
And it tastes so good
And it tastes so good
