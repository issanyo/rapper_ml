[Chorus: Z-Ro]
Who wanna be boo'd up, hell no, I ain't crazy
I only met you last night, no I ain't crazy
Tryna get the keys to my house, I ain't crazy
You sexier than a bitch, but I'm not that crazy
We did it last night, must have drove you crazy
Thinkin' we a couple now, ain't that crazy?
Wanna have a baby, do i look that crazy?
I hope you know now that I'm not that crazy
No, yeah

[Verse 1: Z-Ro]
24 hours later you love me, huh
Don't know what to do with your hands you wanna touch me, huh
You was acting like you was all that (What?)
Now you the one that need the fall back (What?)
Yes, you the one that got lucky, huh (Ha-ha)
'Cause I know I put it down
You was leakin' so much, I thought I was 'bout to drown (Splash)
Now you wanna know who my bae is
Baby I don't do that bae shit
I'm just tryna keep you naked (Hey)
Whenever you come through, I'ma fuck you (Hey)
Might make love to you but you know I don't love you (Hey)
Let's just keep it playa baby
I ain't tryna be your savior baby

[Chorus: Z-Ro]
Who wanna be boo'd up, hell no, I ain't crazy
I only met you last night, no I ain't crazy
Tryna get the keys to my house, I ain't crazy
You sexier than a bitch, but I'm not that crazy
We did it last night, must have drove you crazy
Thinkin' we a couple now, ain't that crazy?
Wanna have a baby, do i look that crazy?
I hope you know now that I'm not that crazy
No

[Verse 2: Carol Cake]
Why you don't pick up the phone when I'm callin'?
Stop actin' like these other niggas don't want me, they all tryna holla
I ain't chasin' nobody, I'd rather be chasin' them dollars
Learned my lesson the hard way, fucked around then I got called up
Could it be my past comin' back turnin' into karma? (Damn)
Had to let my ex go, that boy was nothin' but drama
Only thing I'm worried 'bout is gettin' into these commas
Let's take a trip across the water and go to Yokahoma
If you act right I could be your lady, if you act right I could have your baby
Pull up in that all blacked out Mercedes, cake by the pound, might be stunin' daily (Yeah)
Bitch wanna have beef, pour the gravy (Yeah)
My enemies mad, they love to hate me (Ha)
Self made queen, I ain't never been lazy
One taste of that cake gon' make you crazy

[Chorus: Z-Ro]
Who wanna be boo'd up, hell no, I ain't crazy
I only met you last night, no I ain't crazy
Tryna get the keys to my house, I ain't crazy
You sexier than a bitch, but I'm not that crazy
We did it last night, must have drove you crazy
Thinkin' we a couple now, ain't that crazy?
Wanna have a baby, do i look that crazy?
I hope you know now that I'm not that crazy
No
