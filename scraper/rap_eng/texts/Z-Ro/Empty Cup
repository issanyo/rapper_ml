[Intro: Young Buck]
You know what this is right?
Aye hand me that cup right there Z-Ro
Pour up

[Verse 1: Young Buck]
Mind on my money, I let everything go now
Everything's screwed up, everything's slowed down
All I do is swang on 'em, I'm Rick James on 'em
I buy cocaine on 'em, then buy a chain on 'em
Mane get your cup, we 'bout to go Lil Wayne on 'em
Force field, but my Gucci's didn't get a stain on 'em
Forty pills, all these hoes 'bout to take 'em on
Tell the DJ play the Z-Ro and the Bucker play some Bun
Whole club body rocking, bitch I'm Fat Pat
Bitch I'm Pimp C, I'm Project like Pat
I got it like that, my niggas on E, I fill 'em up
Yeah, I don't give a fuck, never have an empty cup

[Hook: Z-Ro]
Listen up, you'll never catch me with an empty cup
So with the lawyers behind I'mma take another cup
Hell nah motherfucker you know you can't hit my cup
Like these 8 bottles they cost you a couple hundred bucks
Hell nah motherfucker you know you can't hit my cup
Hell nah motherfucker you know you can't hit my cup
Hell nah motherfucker you know you can't hit my cup
Like these 8 bottles they cost you a couple hundred bucks

[Verse 2: Z-Ro]
My cup so muddy the soda don't even move
Make me spill it eventually end up on the evening news
Gangsta from head to toe, maybe dark or some kind of blue
But there's codeine in my cup whenever you see me fool
Niggas be lookin' shife, so I look shife back
Fuck is this? [?] ? Gimme my money right back
Or get a cereal bowl hole in your head
I bet you steal [?] in your bread
Drank drank everyday, if it ain't a pain is a [?]
That's the reason I can't stay up straight
Got my attitude like "Get out my face"
That's cause I'm a Drank Head baby

[Hook]
Listen up, you'll never catch me with an empty cup
So with the lawyers behind I'mma take another cup
Hell nah motherfucker you know you can't hit my cup
Like these 8 bottles they cost you a couple hundred bucks
Hell nah motherfucker you know you can't hit my cup
Hell nah motherfucker you know you can't hit my cup
Hell nah motherfucker you know you can't hit my cup
Like these 8 bottles they cost you a couple hundred bucks

[Verse 3: Z-Ro]
Sippin' codeine
It makes Z-Ro and Young Buck lean (make us lean)
We never been a hoe
Been popping pint bottles since 1994
It's never gon' change
Gone of Vicodins and Lorcets mane
Down south we call 'em bean
And if you in my city hit me up if you wanna lean

[Hook]
Listen up, you'll never catch me with an empty cup
So with the lawyers behind I'mma take another cup
Hell nah motherfucker you know you can't hit my cup
Like these 8 bottles they cost you a couple hundred bucks
Hell nah motherfucker you know you can't hit my cup
Hell nah motherfucker you know you can't hit my cup
Hell nah motherfucker you know you can't hit my cup
Like these 8 bottles they cost you a couple hundred bucks
