[Chorus]
It don't matter what you do for these niggas
They gon' act like didn't do for these niggas
Get on the stand and lie, forget the truth for these niggas
They gon' act like didn't do for these niggas
When they ain't had a gun, you had to shoot for these niggas
They gon' act like didn't shoot for these niggas
They needed a favor, you did two for these niggas
But they gon' still act like, still act like

[Verse 1]
I trust no nigga, trust no bitch
All that showin' love shit at the door
"Ro u acting funny," me, I'm like no shit
I don't fuck with y'all no more (Y'all take care)
I got the sauce like ooh-wee
And my life is like a movie (Yeah)
I'm the man, but he's actin' like it's him though
Usin' me to come up tellin' people he my kin folk (Ha-ha)
I never seen him at a family reunion
And he never broke no bread with me, communion
You always come around here beggin' though
You ain't gettin' shit from me nigga, gon' let it go
That's the reason you mad at me but you won't tell it though
Lookin' at me like I got shit on me, I don't sweat it though
You better hustle, that what paved my way
I ain't walkin' with nobody boy, I paved my way

[Chorus]
It don't matter what you do for these niggas
They gon' act like didn't do for these niggas
Get on the stand and lie, forget the truth for these niggas
They gon' act like didn't do for these niggas
When they ain't had a gun, you had to shoot for these niggas
They gon' act like didn't shoot for these niggas
They needed a favor, you did two for these niggas
But they gon' still act like, still act like

[Verse 2]
Me and my mans gotta do it over some lil shit
So he told my lil bitch about my other lil bitch
I ain't fuckin' with him no mo 'cause he a lil bitch
That was pussy, wonderin' what he'd over a lil [?]
Shit, look I ain't even tryna find out
That's why I don't be havin' no company at my house
Like why you touchin' that, get the fuck outta my house
One deep, I don't even trust me at my house
You like my nigga ballin' but you hate me low key
'Cause you can't borrow no money, you already owe me
Sent your money 'round the corner, you won't even go see
Rather be a hoe to you before I let you hoe me (Hell nah)
My success don't owe you niggas a damn thing
That was on the block, y'all didn't sell a damn thing
I was in the studio, y'all ain't record a damn thing
Like I owe you a brick, more like a half a gram man

[Chorus]
It don't matter what you do for these niggas
They gon' act like didn't do for these niggas
Get on the stand and lie, forget the truth for these niggas
They gon' act like didn't do for these niggas
When they ain't had a gun, you had to shoot for these niggas
They gon' act like didn't shoot for these niggas
They needed a favor, you did two for these niggas
But they gon' still act like, still act like
