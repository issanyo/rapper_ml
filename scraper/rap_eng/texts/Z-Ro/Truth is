[Verse 1:Z-ro]
I don't think I'm the last-I'm the only one of my breed
Because I'm unable to trust-unless it's one of my seeds
Even still I fall in love with the women that give me nothin' but drama
Too busy lookin for what I miss in'my mama
Keep God first is written on every autograph I sign
But hard to practice what I preach, with all this evil on my mind
Cause my premeditation is revenge
Not patient enough to wait on God to handle it for me-I commit sin
You wonder why I never come around
Cause if I'm goin thru it and we're together you might get a lil'down
And I'm not tryna be a party-pooper
Even though I'm rich-I'm use to bein depressed, I'm addicted and just can't quit
Truth is my situation ain't live
My label just paid for lawyers and the advances, and a Chyrstler to drive
You wonder why I'm still holdin' this microphone
To let the people that live a life like mine, know that they're not alone

[Hook Repeat 2x:Z-ro]
Truth is-everybody love to talk about what's wrong with' somebody else
But I'm not scared, to say what's wrong with myself
Truth is-I know I rap about the same thing, again and again
But show me money, happiness, and real-true friends

[Verse 2:Z-ro]
Lately I been thinking about Rhonda and I miss her
But I don't miss my could-be wife I miss my sister
I saw you on the news and I'm sorry for ya loss
Another baby daddy dead and one more kid around the house (damn)
I made I hate you bitch about you and you know that
But check this out...sometimes I be wishin' I could go back
And undo it, never go thru it-try to keep on livin' our lives
All I can say today is I apologize
Even though you did me bad-I ain't mad, cause we both did dirt
But you didn't have to steal from me and make it hurt
Told the laws that I hit you (bitch)-tryed to send me to jail
Then called my phone, screaming you loved me and I loved you as well
But after that wasn't nothin' left accept to let my wheels spin
Now every time I meet a good woman-I'm afraid to let her in
Cause I don't wanna repeat 2003
I know you mad, but if you and the kids every need anything-holla at me
[Hook Repeat 2x:Z-ro]

[Verse 3:Z-ro]
I'd rather walk alone, instead of walkin'20 deep
I'm a shepard, but I know I can't handle too many sheep
Some say I'm a prophet, some say I'm just tryna earn a profit
But if I'm tryna walk right-the Lord gon' keep somethin in my pocket
I curse and I smoke weed and keep a gun in my hand
But I never said I was perfect, I am only a man
I been to jail a couple of times but that don't mean I'm a threat
In fact the Lord was probably protectin' me from my debt
Cause I done had so many beef-with other rappers and police
And gangbangers that claim what I claim wanna see me Rest In Peace
Bury me next to my mama if they lay me down to sleep
Truth is I'm not a person, I'm just another CD
Man I done tripped out on some of my fans, indirectly
So many haters had me thinkin' all of ya'll was tryna disrespect me
Sometimes I wish I was somebody else
But thank the Lord for all of my troubles-cause that's what makes me myself
