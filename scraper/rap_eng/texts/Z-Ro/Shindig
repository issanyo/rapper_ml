Ain't no such thing as love, we can shindig
You can keep your kisses, and hugs, that ain't my pussy
You gon' let the next man fuck, I'm doing fine on my own
But you can borrow my bone
Ain't no such thing as love, we can shindig
You can keep your kisses, and hugs, that ain't my pussy
You gon' let the next man fuck, I'm doing fine on my own
But you can borrow my bone

Go kick it with all them niggas you be runnin' with
Don't get mad at me but I think you be suckin dick
Don't wanna hear no more talkin' about trustin' shit
If I wasn't a real player then I'd bust your lip
I bet I almost slit my wrist over a bitch
If you walk out my life I won't even notice it
Just wanna see my dick going out and going in
If you got an attitude bitch I'll just fuck your friend
I think about you a little bit, but not as much as my money bag
If you don't like it then you can leave give a fuck if you comin back
Rather roll foreign with expensive rims up under that
Not holding hands in the park that shit is fucking whack
Ho, I'm a gangsta, I ain't never been a Yes Man
Approach? it like I'm the law with no badge on my chest man
Instead of fucking you I'd rather fuck my left hand
Cause ain't no love involved, just you, my dick, and my balls

Ain't no such thing as love, we can shindig
You can keep your kisses, and hugs, that ain't my pussy
You gon' let the next man fuck, I'm doing fine on my own
But you can borrow my bone
Ain't no such thing as love, we can shindig
You can keep your kisses, and hugs, that ain't my pussy
You gon' let the next man fuck, I'm doing fine on my own
But you can borrow my bone

When I had time, you didn't have time
Even though I had your back, bitch, you didn't have mine
Even bought your ass a halve, when you didn't have a dime
When you run outta weed that's when you come back around
You keep tellin' me that my dick is the bomb
Every ten minutes you be like Z-Ro gimme some
Hit you from the back you say you feel it in your lungs
You say that's my pussy but bitch you must think I'm dumb
Look it been fourty-eight ours and I ain't heard from you ho
What your mouth ain't workin ain't heard a word from you ho
You act like I'm a jacker tryna take a bird from you ho
So don't act like we a couple just come here and let me fuck you
You gon' talk to that nigga on the phone, I won't interrupt you
You can try and forget about this dick but it's gon' be tough to
Bitch you know I make you bust a nut every time I touch you
But you could never be my woman, you are just a run through

Ain't no such thing as love, we can shindig
You can keep your kisses, and hugs, that ain't my pussy
You gon' let the next man fuck, I'm doing fine on my own
But you can borrow my bone
Ain't no such thing as love, we can shindig
You can keep your kisses, and hugs, that ain't my pussy
You gon' let the next man fuck, I'm doing fine on my own
But you can borrow my bone
