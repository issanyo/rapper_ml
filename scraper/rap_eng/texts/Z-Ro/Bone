Bone, bone, bone
(Z-ro)
Ain’t scared of yall niggas, matter of fact
Niggas better be scared of me!
Mother fuckers, we’re talking down from a safe place, but in my face
Respect is what it better be
Cause if it ain’t I sizzle a nigga like an electric chair, bullet
Proof body suit is what he best to wear
King of the ghetto ent. is a murdering team
I’m a doctor, and I’mma show you what surgery means!
Hey, bitch, don’t get my dick hard if you ain’t gonna use it
You already know I could never love you, I
Just wanna see them titties and that pooty
Cause I turn a lacefront into a laceback
Take this dick bitch or take eight stacks
You gotta pay for the dick to make pay tax
Suck until I decide to give your face back
I’m from nutts hang all day boulevard
That’s a place where none of these niggas go
Rest in peace to the late great H.A.W.K damn right my bigger bro
Homie fuck love, What I look like handcuffing a bitch? I’m tryna send her home
And I much rather see a couple dollars out that bitch than my dick in the ho!
Oh, that’s your sister? who gives a fuck!?
I live the fight and I live to fuck!
A Five Deuce Hoova nigga that is a nutt
Pussy thats OK, but cash is a must!
Yeah, I promise I’m hard to the bone
I leave a cereal bowl hole in yo dome!
Fuck you and whoever you talkin to on your phone!
Just gimmie a reason and your brains will be blown, blown, blown, blown!

Chorus:
Ain’t scared of yall niggas, I’m bad to the bone, bone, bone, bone!
If you don’t wanna get fucked up, then you better get gone, gone, gone, gone!
And I don’t love ya hoes, I just wanna bone, bone, bone, bone!
If you ain't comin up out ya clothes then bitch get gone, gone, gone, gone!
Ain’t scared of yall niggas, I’m bad to the bone, bone, bone, bone!
BONE! BONE! BONE! BONE! BOOONE!
And I don’t love yall hoes, I just wanna bone, bone, bone, bone
BONE! BONE! BONE! BONE! BOOONE!

(ShortDawg)

(Yuh!) It’s understood where fresh is at
Hoes on my dick, like she next to bat
I told boys Ima bring Texas back
They call me Dale Earnhart how I wreck the track
See I the best in-fact why these hoes mad at me?
Can’t bring me down, cause you know I stay fly
I charge haters up like a low battery
And put the dot on ‘em like a lower case i! see
You know I skate by drop top when I peel out
I was raised by gorillas down to kill cops
Recognize a real nigga, I fear not!
Ill turn ya best friend into a teardrop!
Ya chick bop, cause she knew I was on!
Plus I copped the coop and I blew out the dome!
I don’t love hoes cause a few I did bone!
Couldn’t get a scent from me, if she knew my cologne!
I keep the gun in my pants, Niggas get to skating when we come with them vans (scram!)
When they see what they’re facing, they get to running and prayin! (amen!)
And Plus im like E.Honda when it comes to these hands! When it comes to these hands!
The made for caressing and counting, I got ya girl wet as a fountain!
And now she undressing, and bouncing, and sexing and ouching and texting about it!
But I dont want ya chick, you can have her man!
You know Short just like foreign freaks, I called my dawgs up and we ran a train, I guess she like bone thugs and harmony!

Chorus:
Ain’t scared of yall niggas, I’m bad to the bone, bone, bone, bone!
If you don’t wanna get fucked up, then you better get gone, gone, gone, gone!
And I don’t love ya hoes, I just wanna bone, bone, bone, bone!
If you ain't comin up out ya clothes then bitch get gone, gone, gone, gone!
Ain’t scared of yall niggas, I’m bad to the bone, bone, bone, bone!
BONE! BONE! BONE! BONE! BOOONE!
And I don’t love yall hoes, I just wanna bone, bone, bone, bone
BONE! BONE! BONE! BONE! BOOONE!

I’m in that Cadillac hollerin out, knick-nack-patty-wack, give a dog a bone!
I know you got a man, but you need to call me when you’re all alone!
I’ll be all alone, crawling chrome getting my mail man Carl Malone!
Dropping screens, pick your role
Betta watch your queen, cause these chicks is hoes
You see my wrist is froze, she evidentally chose
She wanna fly in the leer, she wanna sit in the rose
Get in the shows while we’re on tour, hop in the bus and now she on tour
The girl he adore, let us tag team Heart Foundation (switch!)
You see this bust out bracelet (ice!) You gotta spot me like im part dalmatian
And girl Short not patient, So go bust it open like a bag of chips when the Magnum rips girl!
Let me hit it from the back like I crashed the whip I got cash to flip so
I’m trying to get that out ya! Then get you out, to the niggas that hop out then threw salt
You dont really wanna see what this pistol bout cuz!

Chorus:
Ain’t scared of yall niggas, I’m bad to the bone, bone, bone, bone!
If you don’t wanna get fucked up, then you better get gone, gone, gone, gone!
And I don’t love ya hoes, I just wanna bone, bone, bone, bone!
If you ain't comin up out ya clothes then bitch get gone, gone, gone, gone!
Ain’t scared of yall niggas, I’m bad to the bone, bone, bone, bone!
BONE! BONE! BONE! BONE! BOOONE!
And I don’t love yall hoes, I just wanna bone, bone, bone, bone
BONE! BONE! BONE! BONE! BOOONE!
