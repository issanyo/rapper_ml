[Hook: Big Moe and Z-Ro]
Rolls wheels and get rolled over, south side soldiers
We da shit bitch, I know you smell the odor
These boys raise hell pushin V 12 motors
We da shit bitch, I know you smell the odor
Rolls wheels and get rolled over, south side soldiers
We da shit bitch, I know you smell the odor
These boys raise hell pushin V 12 motors
We da shit bitch, I know you smell the odor

[Verse 1: E.S.G.]
Now would the freestyle kings stand up?
Hol up I'm kinda sluggish all this lean in my cup
But I'm washed up, redrum, sittin in 22's
Princess cut lightin up my Japanese tattoos
I paid dues, tell them fools, tell them feds I'm back
Ghetto bred pitbull, I ain't scared to scratch
I'm out the gate, po eight, 'cause I don't give a damn
HPD be lookin at me like my name was Gary Graham
Watch my trunk slam and my crack fool, nigga ride wit a fo fo
Bout to decide to shit you, viewed the loop
Sound the news, all these niggas been hatin on us
Big blue lights, lookin tight, twinkle the ice
He's ready to bust, switched it up, ounce up
Diamond grill, big rim too real, two tone green
Four fifteen, six inch screens and Bentley grill
Sandra Hill, Sammy Sosa, I'm out livin la vida loca
E.S.G., Z-Ro, Big Moe, you know we takin over

[Verse 2: Big Moe]
Big M-O-E, pint sippers can't fuck wit me
Fired out sippin drank blowin tree
Did a couple of pints and I'm still not sleep
Three deep screaming, "S-U-C"
Haters better not 'plex wit me, I bet you can't get next to me
On my toes, orange juice and ecstasy
They try to make me lose my mind
Fuck around and make me use my nine
That's why I gotta take a cruise up town
Playa hatas jockin me just because I'm starched down
Ballin out of control and my AC blow cold
Big Moe all up in yo face, never need a skee taste
Knockin off codeine by the case

[Hook: Big Moe and Z-Ro]

[Verse 3: Z-Ro]
Guerilla Maab one deep, and I represent it forever
Them other two bitchmade niggas got cut their tires got severed
I'm all alone, bring it on, 'cause I get wet till I'm drippin
Fuckin wit Z-Ro, you be dealin wit Rugers while they rippin
I'm still the Mo City don, rap game phenomenon
Forever raw but niggas changin like chameleons
Sugar coated for bitches to make em dance and stuff
Ol durag wearin ass nigga wit yo pants leg up
Lookin weaker than water, I startle any contender
Ridgemont 4 representer
Blue over grey foreign corner bender
Ya betta return to sender, 'cause we ain't havin that
SUC been wreckin since niggas was doin the cabbage patch
E.S.G. M O E droppin the verse A to the Z
Demolish your muthafuckin AK leave it cocked up on three
Nothing but murder we roll wit plenty fetti up in our hands
So you can keep watchin me ya

[Outro: Z-Ro]
The odor
