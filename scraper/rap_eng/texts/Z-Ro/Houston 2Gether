[Verse 1]
Uh, I seen a black man rescuing a white man
Can't nobody tell me my city won't be alright man
Flood water to the ceiling, we ain't got no lights man
It ain't safe to brush your teeth, you just might lose your life man
Sister don't give up, I know you 'bout to lose your mind bro
Y'all ain't got no food but you welcome to some of mine though
Shout out to Sylvester Turner, yeah my man kept it real
Didn't leave like a real politician, he stayed here in the field
They say Paul Wall just talking diamonds in his grill
All I see him do is empty out his pockets when it's real
I'm just tryna get us to safety, not tryna get a deal
I see enemies come together and say we here to build (let's do this)
Cause the city's torn down, hardly did us in
Can't sleep in the house tonight when somebody gon' get us in
People putting boats in the water, making sure neighbors good
And I ain't talking the street they live on, I'm talking the neighborhood

[Chorus]
Houston together
I used to wanna see Houston together
Right now I see Houston together
And if you ask me it'll be Houston forever
Houston together
I used to wanna see Houston together
Right now I see Houston together
And if you ask me it'll be Houston forever

[Verse 2]
I know Red Cross coming, what about right now though?
They stranded, they need medicine right now though
Tell big mama we coming, not later, right now, so
She can get her blood pressure down, meanwhile row
The whole city on that water, ain't talking sherm
School just started, school shut down, how they gonna learn?
Can't nobody go to work either so how they gonna earn
40 damn dollars for a pack of bottled water
At least my people pulling all my people out the water
[?] like I'm good, go see about my son or 'bout my daughter
Hell yeah it's getting harder but it's gon' ease up
We need all the help we can get, most of all we need us
Lord Jesus, I know you see us down here
Shout out Kevin Hart, you are appreciated 'round here
25 thousand dollar challenge, we'll need that
I know it's looking like we outta there but we'll be back (H-Town)

[Chorus]
Houston together
I used to wanna see Houston together
Right now I see Houston together
And if you ask me it'll be Houston forever
Houston together
I used to wanna see Houston together
Right now I see Houston together
And if you ask me it'll be Houston forever
