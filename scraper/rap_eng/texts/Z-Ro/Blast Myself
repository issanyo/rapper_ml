[Hook: Z-Ro]
I wake up in the morning and I ask myself
Is life worth living, should I blast myself?
Before I go to sleep at night, I ask myself
Is life worth living, should I blast myself?
Look at myself in the mirror and I ask myself
Is life worth living, should I blast myself?
I got problems but too much pride for me to ask for help
So is life worth living, should I blast myself?

[Verse 1:]
Tell me where to go to get a piece of mind
Cause all I see is suicide receiving me by my tec9
Although my tattoo reads 'no more pain'
Lately I feel the needle hit me up in vein
Most of my real niggas are dead
They done left me with my fake friends
The ones that 'always need you
But don't appreciate' friends
I'm solo when I roll
I live in doubt by myself
That way nobody can blame me for the death of somebody else
Cause the way these niggas hate me is an epidemic
I'm in the line of fire 24/7
Constantly steppin' in it
Hate me cause I'm doing good
Hate me cause I ain't doing bad
At least I got to be a dad
But I got no seeds
I used to bleed for some other cats crashin'
But as far as I'm concerned I would've burned for those creations
My family didn't make it
Make me wonder will I last myself
So is life worth living, should I blast myself?

[Hook:]

Before I go to sleep at night, I ask myself
Is life worth living, should I blast myself?
Look at myself in the mirror and I ask myself

I got problems but too much pride for me to ask for help
So is life worth living, should I blast myself?

[Verse 2: Z-Ro]
It ain't that I sound like 'pac
I sound like stress
Just like automatic when I'm down and depressed
I shed tears cause I do it so good
Thanks to my nothin' ass homies off the block
Nigga fuck my hood
I couldn't shit, shower, and shave
Unless I was willing to pay
That's why I wasn't willing to stay
I could do bad by myself
I ain't even have no money for me
And y'all was laughing like me suffering was funny to see
So wonder why I don't give a fuck about being here
On the other hand I murder motherfuckas
'Do we have a problem here? '
If you beat me to the trigger
I ain't mad homie
Least I ain't gotta cry no more
No more feeling sad homie
Y'all know trae got my back
He gon' look out for my people
God leave me not in temptation
Deliver me from evil
And if it's my time, I'm ready
If it ain't, I'm a ask myself
Man, is life worth living should I blast myself?

[Verse 3: Z-Ro]
I ain't trying to be a role model, but I am
What kind of role model get arrested for 300 grams?
I struggle with my addiction, I ain't perfect
Realize that it's bringing me closer to my grave
So maybe it's worth it
The more codeine I drink
The more I'm not awake
I'm like a prisoner
And syrup is the way I escape
But the message is to the kids
'Do as I say, and not as I do
Cause there could be a brighter future for you'
But as for me; all I know is drama, all I know is pain
27 and I don't know how to smile and that's a shame
I came and I used 77, the first one
By age 10 or 11 fool blown smokin' blunts
Cause weed was what I needed to evade and escape
But reality went in and smacked me dead in my face
Now that I'm gone, I got no more cheeks to turn
So I ask myself, man is life worth living should I blast myself?

[Outro: Z-Ro]
Went to the pitcher full of liquor
Trying to ask for help
Said is life worth living should I blast myself?
Movin' so fast I done broke around and cast myself
Man is life worth living should I blast myself?
I'm tired of bein' broke, where was I when the cash was there?
Man is life worth living should I blast myself?
I just can't take it, I ain't even gotta ask myself
Maybe life ain't worth livin', I'm a blast myself
