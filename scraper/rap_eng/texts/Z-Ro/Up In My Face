(*Talks*)Don't these niggas know we murder niggas for real man?
(*Sings*)Fucking around with Z-Ro nigga ya dead wrong (dead wrong) dead wrong (dead wrong)
(*Talks*)Know I'm saying, when I walk in the motherfuckin club niggas be hatin, but guess what I see though
(*Sings*)I see some niggas tonight that should be having they head stomped (head stomped) head stomped (head stomped)

Z-Ro Verse:
Excuse me, get off my motherfuckin toes
I ain't got no love for you motherfuckin hoes
Raise up, 'fore a nigga blaze up
I'd be the nigga that'll tear yo face up
With a left, a right, I'm out-of-sight, I'm boss
I don't give a fuck, you see me flippin when I floss
Riding with the Trae, riding with the Jay'ton
Riding with my brother, brother, then we be on
On a money making mission, Stackin our feddy
The world ain't ready, so heavy like a Chevy
Slow it down going down, we gon put it up
If you talking shit to us bitch, we shoot it up
Talking bout yo block now, I be riding with my Glock now
It's non-stop now, around the clock now
Gotta get my motherfucker paper
Stacking up my chips like Lego
Hey ho, I just want some brain
That's that nigga Trae, that's my right-hand man
Man, Nigga we gotta master plan
Nothing but thousand dollars spreads up in our hands
Fuck going to jail, gotta make bail
We living in hell, so what the fuck oh well
And I don't give a damn, as long as a nigga stay free
Out here sippin codiene blowing on tree
At ease, motherfucker, just relax
In my pocket, I gotta bunch of green backs
And that's fact, I wouldn't tell no lie
If you run up, I put a swoll on your eye
Don't even try to run up on that water
I beat the nigga like a motherfuckin motor
Like a transmission, and I'm standing up hustlin
On the motherfuckin corner and I'm scufflin
To get my motherfuckin cheese my motherfucking bread
And you get one up in yo head
If you running up, trying to take what mine
And in my fucking pant's line, I got that iron
Under my elastic, I'll put flowers up in a basket
For a bastard, to get his ass kicked
Try to fuck around with nigga that roll with plastic
Yeeaaahh....
