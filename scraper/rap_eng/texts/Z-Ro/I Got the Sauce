[Chorus]
I know they talkin' shit about me but i got the sauce
This rap shit, it wouldn't be nothin' without me 'cause I got the sauce
I'm too clean, get yo goddamn hands off me cause i got the sauce
Got these bitches on my dick, got these niggas tryna be me cause i got the sauce
I know they talkin' shit about me but i got the sauce
This rap shit, it wouldn't be nothin' without me 'cause I got the sauce
I'm too clean, get yo goddamn hands off me cause i got the sauce
Got these bitches on my dick, got these niggas tryna be me cause i got the sauce

[Verse 1]
Why would I worry 'bout a hater fo?
'Cause when I look around me all I see is people like me I don't ever see haters though
They like Ro you done moved out the hood and you doin so good
Can you do me a favor? No
White shoes, white shorts, wit' a sweater wrapped around my neck, you'll never be my neighbor bro
I'm ten off on da green nigga
Shit ain't always what it seems nigga
Ghetto fellow turned boujhee baby, had to walk away from my own team nigga
Guess they got a nightmare mentality, me, I'm livin' out my dreams nigga
You are not poppin
I got stock options
No usin' a money machine nigga
Homie fuckin' wit a nigga I don't fuck wit', I ain't got nothin' to say
But if my my homie fuckin' wit' a nigga that's out to get me fuck both of ya'll all the way
Make my niggas kidnap ya people if ya want them hoes back, better have somethin' to pay
Revenge bitch, even though you didn't see me seein' shit, I bet you know its comin' ya way

[Chorus]
I know they talkin' shit about me but i got the sauce
This rap shit, it wouldn't be nothin' without me 'cause I got the sauce
I'm too clean, get yo goddamn hands off me cause i got the sauce
Got these bitches on my dick, got these niggas tryna be me cause i got the sauce
I know they talkin' shit about me but i got the sauce
This rap shit, it wouldn't be nothin' without me 'cause I got the sauce
I'm too clean, get yo goddamn hands off me cause i got the sauce
Got these bitches on my dick, got these niggas tryna be me cause i got the sauce

[Verse 2]
I'll never swang and bang
I am in my own lane
Sound like a rapper for I what I'm successful doing my own thang
And it ain't a bitch either its a deposit whenever my phone rang
So it ain't a pistol to protect this bag I need somethin' that's gonna go long range
"Hey Ro, they say you snitchin'," who said dat? not Killa Kyleon mane
Might tell my hittas where stayin' at but I'll never tell the coppas yo name
My niggas changed on me, so what? Let squirrel ass niggas go nuts
9 times out of 10 they would end up hooked on blow but theyâ€™ll never blow up
Stop sayin' ya'll solid and stop sayin' all ya'll real, ya'll know I know the truth
I'm the Jay-Z of my city, yo man, three percenter, that nigga we don't even notice you
I ain't made at you for hatin', you a hater so i guess you doin' what ya 'sposed to do
E-even though I'm 97,000 miles away from you, I can get close to you (Vandross)

[Chorus]
I know they talkin' shit about me but i got the sauce
This rap shit, it wouldn't be nothin' without me 'cause I got the sauce
I'm too clean, get yo goddamn hands off me cause i got the sauce
Got these bitches on my dick, got these niggas tryna be me cause i got the sauce
I know they talkin' shit about me but i got the sauce
This rap shit, it wouldn't be nothin' without me 'cause I got the sauce
I'm too clean, get yo goddamn hands off me cause i got the sauce
Got these bitches on my dick, got these niggas tryna be me cause i got the sauce
