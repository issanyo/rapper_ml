GMB (echoes)

[Chorus:]
Ain’t no puff puff pass
Everybody in here got they own bag
And we’re just smokin’
And we’re just smokin’
(and we’re just smokin’)
I love getting high with ma niggas
Ashtray full of cigarettes and cigars
And we’re just smokin’
Until we’re chokin

[Verse 1:]
Yeah half ounce of super sour
Half ounce of OG
Someone’s smoking an ounce
Of super sour OG
Sometimes I smoke with people
That don’t even know me
But it got to be my shit
I only smoke zero’s weed
Niggas be puttin more that weed in the blunt
That shit ain’t smelling right my nigga
Get this weed or what?
Have you so goddamn high
You don’t come down no more
But I’m so goddamn high
I come down and smoke me some more
All hail from the motherfuckin Cali
I [?] from a white boy
Didn’t get it out the alley
OG  Berry
OG Woody
I got butter kush
My homie call it
“i’m a bad motherfucker” kush
Legalise it
It ain’t hurting nobody
When I’m fucked up
I ain’t thinkin bout murchin nobody
Look all I wanna do
Is let the wind blow
Feel like I might suffocate
If I don’t let down all my windows

[Chorus]

[Verse 2:]
Smoking round paper cones
Kush to the dome
And we don’t live in Cali
But we got this shit at home
E’erybody got a bag
And e’erybody got a cup
By the end of the night
E’erybody be fucked up
We high but we leaning
Young still smoking
We smoking on that Reggie nigga
Pop up on the [?]
These niggas out there roachin
Talkin bout they got that fire
As soon as they light up
I can smell that he a liar
Yo dro’ smell expired
Let me go’n get you higher
We bout to go outer space
Just pass me the lighter
Keep smokin
Keep rollin
Even then we fucked up
We still blowing
It’s just a habit
Everyday gotta have it
All I wanna do is smoke
I’m a kush addict
Yeah
A green fiend
I only fuck with the best
I say no to Reggie
If it’s OG [?]

[Outro:]
I feel like I can touch the sky
Homie i’m so high
I feel like I can touch the sky
Homie I’m so high
I feel like I can touch the sky
Homie I’m so high
