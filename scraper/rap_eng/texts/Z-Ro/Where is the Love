[Chorus]
Where is the love
Where is the love

[Verse 1]
Nobody loves me, but I prefer to keep it like that
'Cause most friends are falsified trying to steal out your stack
So I keep my partnas to a minimum even though I know half can't be trusted
Yo only friend in the world might steal your girl if enough flesh was lusted
Nigga now who was to blame for the pain cause fucking with me nigga you a get sprayed
Hardheaded that's like fucking a bitch with no condom And knowing that ho got aids
Better be smart, better keep your distance anger elevates from loose leaf pages
When I'm going off in the rage of furious chambers of twin gauges
My calico murders are filling my mind and my mind is so ready to click
Better freeze, better not breathe all I want is the money remember you dead if you twitch
'Cause I'm a killa that's killing for cash
I show no compassion when stealing your stash
Done filling the swisher because I'm too fast
Not ever revealing what's under my mask
I'm making a dash
I jump in the hoop and I smash with a foot on the gas and then I'm off in the night
A nigga was buried alive but he really should of died dig him up his coffin too tight
A nigga was showing a busta love, but now it's hunting for a busta season
And he gave me the reason, to run in your crib and leave you bleeding

[Chorus]
Where is the love
Where is the love
Where is the love
(Nigga where yo love mane?)
Where is the love

[Bridge]
The question at hand is
Where's your motherfucking love
I'm a do like that boy Al D said
I'm showing love to the ones that showed love back
Fuck friends, so Mexican D, Grady
You know where your love at

[Verse 2]
I was raised to never let em see me sweat
And how to dodge bullets never let em hit my chest
I saw the ways of the wise and how to live in peace
But fate said we got to stand and fight the beast with open eyes
Which means I got to keep my Glock, on a day to day basis
Always protect myself and no more catching murder cases
Niggas a try to erase me and that's a fact, but if I got to go
Nigga I be damned if my trigga finger isn't pulling back
I had niggas I was real with then use to chill with
Now they coming at me with the drama that I can't deal with
I think they out to get me but I can't let em, just like Pac and Spice 1
The jealous got me strapped
So when I go to spraying I'ma wet him
I had love for y'all
I use to cut for y'all
Nigga we was family I shed blood for y'all
But now you hate me cause of my progress
You want me dead I'm waiting on you niggas you know my address
But if my name is on the bullet and I die
You got to lay it down one day, guess who gone be waiting on the other side
Go on and pull your pistol from your belt
But no man can take my life away from me until I lay it down my damn self
Tried to kill me once and paralyzed my mobility
Now that I can walk again don't even think about getting me
Not saying I won't die, you hoes can try to murder me and get me
And if I kick the bucket nigga, fuck it you kicking it with me
'Cause I'ma be trying my best
To put you to the rest
'Cause you don't understand
That I ain't down with dying at the hands of another man

[Chorus]
Where is the love
Where is the love
Where is the love
