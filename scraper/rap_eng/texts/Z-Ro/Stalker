[Intro: Z-Ro]
I'm a player. I can't be dealing with this

[Verse 1: Z-Ro]
After the first night I hit you with the mule
Now I'm sitting here looking like a fool
Cause this woman won't get out my bed
I gave her my number cause I took a chance
All I really wanted was a piece of ass
But ended up with something else instead
Why do you keep blowing up my phone
That's why my battery is always dead
I wish that you would just leave me alone
Give the pig feet to somebody else instead

[Hook: Z-Ro]
Stop calling me, stop texting me
Stop blowing up my phone
Instead of chasing me, you should be erasing me
You ain't getting no more of this bone
Stop stressing me you S-T-A-L-K-E-R
You're a stalker, and you're taking it a little too far

[Verse 2: Z-Ro]
I never thought I'd need a restraining order
But I'm thinking about getting one put on you
Because it ain't cute no more
And every time I turn around, I see your car
Even though you're not invited, still here you are
And that just ain't cool
Why do you keep blowing up my phone
That's why my battery is always dead
I wish that you would just leave me alone
Go give somebody else that head

[Hook: Z-Ro]
Stop calling me, stop texting me
Stop blowing up my phone
Instead of chasing me, you should be erasing me
You ain't getting no more of this bone
Stop stressing me you S-T-A-L-K-E-R
You're a stalker, and you're taking it a little too far

[Bridge: Z-Ro]
You make me want to change my number
You make me want to move out of state
Make me want to paint my car a different color
You make me want to get new plates
Make me want to pay 'hood bitches to jump you
You make me want to wear dark shades
You got me trying to hide around corners
I wish you would just go away

[Hook: Z-Ro]
Stop calling me, stop texting me
Stop blowing up my phone
Instead of chasing me, you should be erasing me
You ain't getting no more of this bone
Stop stressing me you S-T-A-L-K-E-R
You're a stalker, and you're taking it a little too far

[Hook: Z-Ro]
Stop calling me, stop texting me
Stop blowing up my phone
Instead of chasing me, you should be erasing me
You ain't getting no more of this bone
Stop stressing me you S-T-A-L-K-E-R
You're a stalker, and you're taking it a little too far
