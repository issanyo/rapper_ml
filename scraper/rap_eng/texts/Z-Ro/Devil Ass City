I only fear god in this devil ass city
Keep my head up high cause I know these niggas can't fuck with me
Asshole by nature one deep pussy nigga come get me (come on)
Get yo ass with the curtis, what the fuck is a curtis, my nigga that's a fifty
I only fear god in this devil ass city
Keep my head up high cause I know these niggas can't fuck with me
Asshole by nature one deep pussy nigga come get me (come on)
Get yo ass with the curtis, what the fuck is a curtis, my nigga that's a fifty

[Verse]
Motherfuck yo dress code and I ain't taking off my hat cause I'm in chill mode
And I could buy this club if I really wanted to buy this club because I got real dough
She say it feels so good when I feel so wood she don't need no dildo
And I know she ain't lying cause she blow up my phone, didn' talk to her she still popped up at my home
This punk ass sheriff was like "Are these yo guns?" cause these ain't regular guns this is some hunting shit
I was like god damn right they all mine
I guess every now and then a nigga like to go and hunt for shit
And I ain't got to tell you I'm the truth in the booth and I really don't give a fuck if yall don't like me
I'm Fox 26 [?] like I'm like Isiah Carey in this bitch
I tell it the way it is not the way it might be
That's what's up, but what you here for?
I'm here to put a hole a size of the cereal bowl in yo motha fuckin head
And I ain't really trippin' on you bitch ass niggas unless you fuckin' with my mutha fuckin' bread
But you ol internet gangstas on my page playa hatin' everyday I can't even see what ya saying
Cause even one of my people was trippin' I had to show I was really about my business, he was about to be dead
I ain't trying to have a relationship, I'm just trying to beat my case every month I'm up in the court house
Bitch ass badge wearing ass tryna lie to get a conviction they don't want me to leave from the court house
My game too strong my bill bond game too strong, faith in God game too strong
To be a real ass nigga, first off all fake nigga you can't be on none of that shit you on
When me roll around with them killers know we don't play
Hit you with the mini 1-4 you gonna go (rick ross grunt) like Rozay
These pussy niggas think they real, but they so fake
Hit 'em with the triple threat shotgun, they gonna go (rick ross grunt) like Rozay
Don't treat me like no rapper I ain't none of them
Never got no royalty check but the money kept comin' in
If I give yo ass a pass most likely you'll get done again
I don’t trust none of y’all motherfuckers I got my gun again
And every year I am like Javari I need another dope key
Cause you know I'm kush to these hating ass niggas, these hating ass niggas be trying to smoke me
That's what the chopper for, I lay they ass down like vocals
They fuck with me in Africa how dare you say I'm local
I’m loco but I'm just trying to smoke doe
Keep fuckin' with me you and your whole family go go
And I would love to do it myself but you see I got shit to do
And I be out of town on stage when the choppas put the mess on them, keep on puttin the dick in you
Shame on a nigga that tried to run game on a nigga, dropping names on a nigga, 7 mm aimed on you nigga
Hit you from the nosebleeds all the way across a football game on a nigga and open up a brain on a nigga and leave a nigga drippin like sancho (?)
Cause real team is original top shotta you won't even get to see out i'm yo last hoe
And I be everywhere where these pussy niggas can't go, and I see everywhere they wanna see wanna see
I'm on the wall, I ain't fuckin with the dance flo
And if you ain't a bad bitch get the fuck out of front of me
Use to be broke now I get bread out the money tree
And they ain't fuckin with ya cause you sweeter than honey bee
I use to be good now I be up to no good that's why I fuck all of yall, homie look what I done to me

[Hook]
I only fear god in this devil ass city
Keep my head up high cause I know these niggas can't fuck with me
Asshole by nature one deep pussy nigga come get me (come on)
Get yo ass with the curtis?, what the fuck is a curtis, my nigga that's a fifty
