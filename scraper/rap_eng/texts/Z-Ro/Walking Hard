[Verse 1]
Well...
I used to fuck with jack to get that candy spray
Now its third coast customs 80 and candy jays
I be rollin hard till ain't no more meat on the tires
Till its time to go to Rollos and buy some more fo fo's for the lo lo
The chrome on the swangers look like glass its so glossy
Makin ???? when you raise up off me
I know you wanna take a couple of pictures in from of my ride
Handle your business little momma ill be inside
Ain't no love, but we can make love
However you want it you can get it that way
But your still ain't nothin but a ????
And as for me, you might think im nuts
Cause whats important to you ain't as important to me
I guess i really dont give a fuck!

[Chrorus]
Ive come so far when i turn around i just see foot steps baby
Ive been walking hard, walking hard...
And even though most of my steps where bad still made a few good steps baby
Its all apart of walking hard, walking hard...

[Verse 2]
Please... Respect my mind..
Ive got the mentality, of a mo city nigga
If im not sleepin im on my grind
Peace, that would be nice
But my reality is me against the world
Dont nobody want me to live my life
First they catch the fish for you
Then they teach you how to fish
Once you learn how to do it they won't let you come back to the fishing hole
Unless you willing to give up half of what you catch
If not the game warden will confiscate the whole net
But me im an outlaw, going against the powers that be
Thats what Joseph Wayne McVey is about yall
And when they lay me in my hole
They gone say that was a man right there
I put that on my soul

[Chrorus]

[Verse 3]
Who can you trust, when everybody around you is somebody you can't trust
Cause these bitches just want my dick, TDC just want my freedom
My enemies just want my money cause they got children and they can't afford to feed em
Who can you trust, when everybody around you is somebody you can't trust
Most likely to be the weed man, cause seem like hes the realist one to me man
Cause 730 bags later still ain't so seeds mann
I know you wonder why i ain't say the drank mann
Cause a couple of times that shit wasn't even much no drank man
That was slime in the ice machine
Dont you know people put that shit in there body, that ain't right to me
Everybody wanna know if im still beefin with Trae, Nope
Hes just doin him and im doin Joseph McVey
Ya that used to be my nigga used to be my ace
But now my nigga is that magnum i keep in my waist
