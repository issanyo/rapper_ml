See I walk like a gangsta, I talk like a gangsta
I move like a gangsta 'cause nigga, I'm a G
My daddy was a gangsta, my uncle was a gangsta
So you know they had to pass the shit down to me

Let's do it

Yeah, I move like a gangsta with that 45
I'm riding high I'm Interstate 45
Benz with a stash box, G5 laptop
So many keys, I can open up a padlock

My black lock, my hat cocked to the right
I'm a nigga with a attitude for life
These little kids like to mimic what they see
Go to college, play ball or get a GED

You wanna be a G-A-N-G-S-T-A
But you don't know niggas lose they life
Every day drug wars between different drug lords
And I'm like yeap mouth nigga, I'm a thug lord

I never start beef but I cook it though
Nigga, you can't afford this car what you lookin' for
I thought so you will never be me
Pay attention to my words 'cause the life of a G

See I walk like a gangsta, I talk like a gangsta
I move like a gangsta 'cause nigga, I'm a G
My daddy was a gangsta, my uncle was a gangsta
So you know they had to pass the shit down to me

See I don't try to be hard 'cause rap, nigga
'Cause legally I walk around with a strap, nigga
So if you run up on me tryin' to rap, nigga
When I clap nigga, it's a rap, nigga

Y'all motherfuckers ain't hard, nigga
You a gimic, nigga we the next rappers life and no limit, nigga
They love me in the hood 'cause I made a way
'Cause now I got them niggas on the road gettin' paid

A real gangsta, I ballin', we don't need a sale
A real gangsta a dip, we don't even care
I ran the streets before four years tryin' make it happen
From basketball to that Power Rex, naw I made it rappin'

See I walk like a gangsta, I talk like a gangsta
I move like a gangsta 'cause nigga, I'm a G
My daddy was a gangsta, my uncle was a gangsta
So you know they had to pass the shit down to me

See I walk like a gangsta, I talk like a gangsta
I move like a gangsta 'cause nigga, I'm a G
My daddy was a gangsta, my uncle was a gangsta
So you know they had to pass the shit down to me

Now it's 2005
And I'm still here I been rappin' since '95
So that's 10 years, I been around of Gs my whole life
'Cause my daddy taught me young, it's a cold life

He told me make sure my Cali goes straight 3
Before I make a honest livin' to stay free
So back then I studied 'Pac and Jay-Z
Me and my crew stealin' Polo from Macy's

But I don't smoke with everybody 'cause they lace weed
That why when I cop Dro it's a QP
It'll last me for a week then I'm back again
Goddamn look at them spinners on my lakazin

See I walk like a gangsta, I talk like a gangsta
I move like a gangsta 'cause nigga, I'm a G
My daddy was a gangsta, my uncle was a gangsta
So you know they had to pass the shit down to me

See I walk like a gangsta, I talk like a gangsta
I move like a gangsta 'cause nigga, I'm a G
My daddy was a gangsta, my uncle was a gangsta
So you know they had to pass the shit down to me
