[Intro]
This one is dedicated to my niggas
Now I don't always act like y’all my niggas all the time
Y'all be pissin' a nigga the fuck off
But I swear fo’ God I love y'all like a motherfucker mane
Loyal until the motherfucker soil
[?], I'll see you when I get there
Damn

[Verse 1]
We might bump heads sometimes, but you still my nigga
Kill 'em all if just one of 'em try to kill my nigga
You do some hoe shit I'ma tell you that ain't right my nigga
Might not talk to ya for 2-3 months but you are still my nigga
When we hook up we don't look for bitches, we look for riches
They like "she look so sexy," we like "she look so suspicious"
Don’t want no pussy, just opportunity that she could give us
’Cause she know we got that work and she know we deliver
We don't pop too many bottles though
Trap phone keep on ringin’ you know we gotta go
It's 10 of us at 100K a piece, we got a whole thing
It ain't no iron, we-we together, ain't no name
You-you got a problem, we got a problem, it’s like that
We gon' handle that right now, ain't no "I'll be right back"
If something happened to me, I know you got my kids though
I swear y'all my motherfuckers, y'all know what it is bro

[Chorus]
Through all the good times, bad times
All the time, homie we all (Gang, gang, gang, gang)
Get on the stand and lie for you, ride for you
Even die for you, we all (Gang, gang, gang, gang)
And I'ma keep it real here, years later still here
That'll never (Change, change, change, change)
Until the day I R.I.P. and they bury me a G
I will be with my (Gang, gang, gang, gang)

[Verse 2]
Now you can't fuck my wife, but you can fuck my bitch
We Wild 'N Out like Nick Cannon, Carlos, we cousin shit
Might violate my probation just for the fuck of it
Protest my shit like Meek Mill, they don't know who they fuckin' with
And we from the same hood, we from e'rywhere
And we don't cheat the big homie, so we say air prayer
Maybe that's why we so blessed, don't worry 'bout a thing
We worried 'bout the stock droppin', they worried 'bout a chain
I'm-I'm tryna teach people somethin', I'm worried 'bout they brains
Separate we fly first class, together we could buy a plane
Until the wheels fall off, I know y'all ridin' wit' me
Fuck a bag of kush, drop some money on this island wit' me
It ain't no fun if you a passenger, you drivin' wit' me
When I lie to these bitches, I know you lyin' wit' me
I-I know I be like I'm one deep but y'all a part of that
77053, that's where it started at

[Chorus]
Through all the good times, bad times
All the time, homie we all (Gang, gang, gang, gang)
Get on the stand and lie for you, ride for you
Even die for you, we all (Gang, gang, gang, gang)
And I'ma keep it real here, years later still here
That'll never (Change, change, change, change)
Until the day I R.I.P. and they bury me a G
I will be with my (Gang, gang, gang, gang)

[Chorus/Outro]
Through all the good times, bad times
All the time, homie we all (Gang, gang, gang, gang)
Get on the stand and lie for you, ride for you
Even die for you, we all (Gang, gang, gang, gang)
And I'ma keep it real here, years later still here
That'll never (Change, change, change, change)
Until the day...
