[Intro]
Uh huh

[Verse 1]
I play it cool, keep it a calm, I be real chill
Disrespect me, I'll turn into a Kill Bill
Bad bitch put a bomb under ya rear wheel
I promise I'm a pussy nigga if ya still live
He used to being asshole and he still is
Still don't know what a record deal is
I got my own style, never would I steal his
Wherever I'm located, that's where the real is
My young Mo City niggas keep the Dracos
Looking for the twenties, you a dime, bitch, ya can't go
Get money now, what the fuck is I'ma wait for?
I'm tryna check a hundred thousand every day, hoe
Got them niggas in them neighborhoods tryna find ya
Vice Lords and them Hoover niggas right behind ya
We killin' everything, do I gotta remind ya?
Must forgot I was a real nigga all-time

[Pre-Chorus]
No, I ain't gotta go to the trunk
Right here, right now with my gun
Tried to tell y'all Ro ain't the one
Fuckin' with me, cool, here I come

[Chorus]
Never been a hoe
So somebody gotta go
Keep fuckin' with me
Bet ya won't fuck with nobody no mo'

[Verse 2]
I'm a lesbian, homie, I don't touch boys
One deep, I don't kick it with them fuck boys
Ain't seen me in so long, they sent the law to my house
To check on my 'cause I ain't been making enough noise
Pardon me, I'm just ballin' like a shooting guard
Not in a movie, but I'm livin' like a movie star
I'm so high, I try to jump out of a moving car
And I'll knock yo ass out, no matter who you are
No Love Boulevard, that's my block, hoe
Police everywhere, but it don't stop, though
Used to be on 19, now, the top floor
He hate me? What he looking at the top for?
Look, BJ, ya better tell 'em, bro!
[? 1:53], they gon' smell 'em, bro
[? 1:55]
Fuck with me, ya best friend murk ya ass, never know
Mike D, that's my brother from another mother
Matter fact, is Third Ward in this motherfucker?
South Side, North Side, yeah, the whole city
West Side, East Side, how these haters gon' hit me?

[Pre-Chorus]
No, I ain't gotta go to the trunk
Right here, right now with my gun
Tried to tell y'all Ro ain't the one
Fuckin' with me, cool, here I come

[Chorus]
Never been a hoe
So somebody gotta go
Keep fuckin' with me
Bet ya won't fuck with nobody no mo'
