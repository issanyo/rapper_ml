Bitch, I'm clean, that's all I know
'Cause yo mama and yo gal told me so
Bitch, I'm clean, that's all I know
You can see my pinky ring shinin' that's fo' sho'

Bitch, Im clean, that's all I know
And I'm ridin' in the drop real slow
Bitch, I'm clean, that's all I know
When I pass by watch they mouth strike a pose

Lord, have mercy, man, I'm so clean
Like Oil of Olay and Irish spring
And I feel nothin' 'cause I'm a one man team
What the fuck I'm a smile fo' my mug stay mean

You can buy a denali wit' da diamonds in my mouth
You can buy an apartment wit' da diamonds on my wrist
I been screwed up click ever since 96'
Z-Ro the crooked and paul wall up in this, bitch

In da aston martin outside
Seein' sumbody, baby, momma gon' take a rid
I'm rollin' on cigarillo afta cigarillo afta cigarillo
Goddammit, I'm high

Orford Dodger jeans, Orford Dodger shirt
And da shoes to match goddamit
I'm fly can't forget 3rd coast customs
Got da van lookin' like a slice of blueberry pie

And I love vegetables in fact
I'm wearin' 70 karats around my neck
And 11 mo around my finger
But who countin' anyway
I'm tryna cash my publishin' check

I'm rollin' on 84's and vogues
Twenty inches above the ground
I keep 10,000 in a briefcase wit me
In case I ever go outta town

You keep it real wit' me I keep it real wit' you
And don't waste my time 'cause I got shit to do
If it's important then I'm a really get wit' you
But be patient 'cause I got sum mo shit to do

I'm steppin' ova hatas in my brown and beige gators
My shoulda slap up under my blazer
And if I do say so myself, I'm sharper than a razor

Bitch, I'm clean, that's all I know
'Cause yo mama and yo gal told me so
Bitch, I'm clean, that's all I know
You can see my pinky ring shinin' that's fo' sho'

Bitch, I'm clean, that's all I know
And I'm ridin' in the drop real slow
Bitch, I'm clean, that's all I know
When I pass by watch they mouth strike a pose
