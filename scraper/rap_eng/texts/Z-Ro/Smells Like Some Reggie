Y'all boys smoking on that Hell naw homie
Whole pound burning I can't even smell y'all homie
The popo coming but I don't need to tell y'all homie
Get caught with that I bet they won't even jail y'all homie
Me I smoke that super loud, I can't even kill the smell
Long as it's that super loud, call me Mr. Will Inhale
You ain't on that super loud, bro you need to kill yourself
King Louis OG for me, that's what you need to get yourself
I be smoking like a broke stove bro
I am not even here no more I am so gone bro
I got cotton mouth so bad I need a sno cone bro
If you ain't got this at the crib what you gon' go home for?

[Chorus]
Smells like some reggie (smells like some reggie)
I don't smoke that reggie (I don't smoke that reggie)
Y'all boys smoking on that hell naw homie
Whole pound burning I can't even smell y'all homie
Smells like some reggie (smells like some reggie)
I don't smoke that reggie (I don't smoke that reggie)
Y'all boys smoking on that hell naw homie
Whole pound burning I can't even smell y'all homie

I'm in love with Mary Jane
She really relax my brain
I can't even open my eyes
I can't even feel no pain
And when I'm feeling low
I know just what I need
Hell no it ain't no reggie baby
I'ma need no sticks no seeds
Get off the highway go straight and make the last left
He ain't never ever got a couple bags left
What I be smoking on known to take your last breath
What y'all be smoking on known to give you bad breath

[Chorus]
Smells like some reggie (smells like some reggie)
I don't smoke that reggie (I don't smoke that reggie)
Y'all boys smoking on that hell naw homie
Whole pound burning I can't even smell yall homie
Smells like some reggie (smells like some reggie)
I don't smoke that reggie (I don't smoke that reggie)
Y'all boys smoking on that hell naw homie
Whole pound burning I can't even smell yall homie

What are you smoking?
Cause that ain't that loud loud loud
If you smoking on that quiet, kill yourself
What are you smoking?
Cause that ain't that loud loud loud
If you smoking on that quiet, kill yourself
