[Verse 1]
I was focused on baby I ain't call y'all
But now I'm back and all my bitches in my call log (how you doin)
36 lubricated condoms, no raw dog
I'ma drank an orange juice then I'ma run through all y'all
Girls they, girls they love me
They just think I'm mean they be like, "Girl, he might punch me"
Not if you a real woman baby you should come see
Then you can tell your friend every time he touch me
I try to change the sheet
We ain't even in the bed yet
We on the floor
So why the fuck is the bed wet?
What ya mean, stop baby it ain't bread yet
I'm so up in it she like, "Rother where your legs at?"
I ain't with that boyfriend shit, I'm back now
These new bitches is niggas, they don't know how to act now
We ain't spendin' life together, just a night together
Oh you love me? I'm like whatever, bitch I'm layin' pipe forever
Still a player

[Chorus]
I was really tryin' baby
But I was wantin' to chuck the deuces for so long
And if you feel, like I feel baby
Look I tried to be a one woman man, it didn't work out
Tell the truth it feel better when I work out

[Verse 2]
Listen, you was fuckin' your homegirl the whole time
Why we wasn't fuckin' your homegirl the whole time
So I was fuckin' your homegirl the whole time
You came in the front
I'm bout to back door the whole time
All that shit you talkin' baby
Keep your mouth closed
Remember you were just a guest in my household
You ain't tryna fuck then what you all up in my house fo'?
Here go ya cheap clothes
Take off my expensive house robe
She like, "Where ya woman at?"
I'm like, "I don't know"
Offered me some white
I'm like, "Nah baby, I don't blow"
I don't do no kissin', affection is what I don't show
If you lookin' for a love connection you can go on go
Aye baby, what it do? What the business is?
I'm just tryna put my lil man where ya kidneys is
What you worried bout Just Brittany for a hoe
I know that's why my bitches don't hit me no mo'
Still a player

[Chorus]
I was really tryin' baby
But I was wantin' to chuck the deuces for so long
And if you feel, like I feel baby
Look I tried to be a one woman man, it didn't work out
Tell the truth it feel better when I work out
