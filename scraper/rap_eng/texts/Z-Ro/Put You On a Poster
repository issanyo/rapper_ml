[Intro: Lanlawd]
(Oh boy, don't you disrespect me)
Lanlawd
Mo City
Z-Ro on to the mornin'

[Chorus: Lanlawd]
Boy them nothin' like them know me, I don't know ya
You know I got my gun, so does my chaueffer
Back up off me boy, don't get no closer
You gon' make me put you on a poster
You gon' make me put you on a poster
You gon' make me put you on a poster
You gon' make me put you on a poster
You gon' make me put you on a poster

[Verse 1: Z-Ro]
I ain't 'bout all that talkin', I'ma show ya
You stretched out on the floor, I tried to told ya
I'm just tryna chill, don't make me be a soldier
Get that camera out my face, don't make me choke ya
I'm just tryna chill and smoke a lil' bud, are you friend, are you fo?
What the fuck up wit' you cuz, wanna rob me but keep sayin'
"Bro I'm tryna give you love," fuck wit' me but I ain't talkin' roofies
But that's gon' get you drugged
Look I don't be givin' a damn about none of these niggas and hoes
I already got a lotta "leave me alone," ya know I need to get me some mo
I'm bettin' one deep at the table spendin' money like it's a dinner for fo
Fuck out my face, why you all up in my space nigga, boppas make a play and then get up n' go

[Chorus: Z-Ro]
Stop actin' like you know me, I don't know ya
You know I got my gun, so does my chaueffer
Back up off me please, stop coming closer
You gon' make me put you on a poster
You gon' make me put you on a poster
You gon' make me put you on a poster
You gon' make me put you on a poster
You gon' make me put you on a poster

[Verse 2: Z-Ro]
Must be I done had enough seasons
'Cause I promise I ain't goin' for that this evenin'
Usually I'm the one who makes sure we keep on breathin'
Today I can't promise you we gon' be here to see this weekend
Everything changin', everybody actin' funny
I can tell when you broke motherfuckers finally get some money
Look I'm the same nigga when it's rainy, when it's sunny
Stop roachin', you ain't earn it then you ain't get nothin' from me
Bitch, I've been doin' this shit since 1996, go read about me
You don't gotta believe me, go ask the streets about me
Who that wanna do that like run up on a nigga that'll run in yo mouth
I'm Christianmingle.com but I'll run up in yo house

[Chorus: Z-Ro]
Stop actin' like you know me, I don't know ya
You know I got my gun, so does my chaueffer
Back up off me please, stop coming closer
You gon' make me put you on a poster
You gon' make me put you on a poster
You gon' make me put you on a poster
You gon' make me put you on a poster
You gon' make me put you on a poster
