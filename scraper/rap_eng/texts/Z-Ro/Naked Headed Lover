Show me some ID, 'cause I ain't trynna' get in trouble
Damn yeah we gon' use rubbers, ain't your naked headed lover
Show me some ID and then we can get down to business
Sexual physical fitness, I'm all under you kidneys
Show me some ID, 'cause I ain't trynna' end up in the penitentiary
Woman you so fine I know where you and me should be
I say woman you so fine I know where you and me should be, in my slab

[Verse 1]
Yeah, first things first I'ma roll one up
Gonna' get comfortable baby I gotta' po' up my cup
I promise you thicker than all of this codeine I just po'd up
Promise my nigga 'bout to be so mad but keep screaming I don't give a fuck
They call me [?] baby
Used to be on mugshots now I'm on posters baby
Ain't nothing wrong with a lil' bump and grind
Gon' get closer baby
If they trip don't trip, it ain't never in a holster baby
Gangster shit
We never be giving a fuck about haters, haters give a fuck about us
Jay-Z and Beyonce's sister in the elevator every week that be us
But we don't be fighting and we don't be arguing we just do triple X stuff
And you know I know you like it rough

[Hook]
Show me some ID, 'cause I ain't trynna' get in trouble
Damn yeah we gon' use rubbers, ain't your naked headed lover
Show me some ID and then we can get down to business
Sexual physical fitness, I'm all under you kidneys
Show me some ID, 'cause I ain't trynna' end up in the penitentiary
Woman you so fine I know where you and me should be
I say woman you so fine I know where you and me should be, in my slab

[Verse 2]
Yeah, I ain't gon' stalk you lil' momma that's not my MO
I'm known to never love em', just fuck em' and then let them go
Woman this ain't no one night stand this is a [?]
We gon' use your mouth so much I bet you this year you gon' grow some dimples
Seem like I stay in Walmart buying sheets
'Cause every time her legs come apart that [?]
And I ain't talking about a puddle or two, I'm talking Ozaka
[?], Aquafina, that's what the fuck I call her
Seems like I'm addicted to big old booties and big old breastses
And I ain't just fucking for me, I'm fucking for Texas dick
Bet you ain't gon' tell your homegirl I didn't kill it
I [?]
And my hand on my motherfucking penis

[Hook]
Show me some ID, 'cause I ain't trynna' get in trouble
Damn yeah we gon' use rubbers, ain't your naked headed lover
Show me some ID and then we can get down to business
Sexual physical fitness, I'm all under you kidneys
Show me some ID, 'cause I ain't trynna' end up in the penitentiary
Woman you so fine I know where you and me should be
I say woman you so fine I know where you and me should be, in my slab
