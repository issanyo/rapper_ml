I been through enough with you
For a matter fact to much with you
And loving doesn't mean I will continue to fuck with you
This aren't a fuck you song, it's a thank you for not loving me, causing me to love myself
This is an I love you song
How can I please somebody that can't be please?
There aren't nothing for Z-ro to do but leave
Aren't no such thing as a happy home unless im leaving alone
Even though its not your time of mouth your cycle is on..
Though I get enough beef in the street to eat
When I get to the crib you try to feed it to me every time you speak
R.Kelly got you self-centered
What about when a brother is fed up?
Its hard to keep his head up
See but this is the last time your going to try to run my life
You wanna run something?
Become a Dyke and get yourself a wife

[Bridge]
Me?
I'm going to miss you
But the size 12 can kick you where the good lord spilt you
Not trying to diss just telling you why I love you
Bitch

[Chorus]
Thank for making it hard to make it better for us
I was just trying to make some chitter for us
I'm a one woman man
But
When my one woman starts tripping
You can find where the strippers be striping
I went out to get it and I came back with it
I never complain I just handle my business
God is my witness
I'm a one woman man
But
When my one woman starts tripping
You can find where the strippers be striping

[Verse 2]
Just be a lady in the street
You oughter to be a freak in the sheets
Just be respectful when your speaking to me
They say you never miss a good thing until its on its way out
You should have seen the sign when I started to stay out all night long
Dodging your call on the phone, not because im cheating
But im drinking and chafing, comtraplaing(s) if im staying or leaving
It aren't no question if I love you girl, it just your attitude makes me wanna hurl
I know I give it to you
How you want it when im in you
You just say the word I just slow down change position
And then continue
Then you be acting like you don't know me when your aren't sexing
I in jail stressing, and your mad at me for not showing affection
Pardon me for being human
If im not pleasing you then you got a problem with what im doing

[Bridge]
Me?
I'm going to miss you
But the size 12 can kick you where the good lord spilt you
Not trying to diss just telling you why I love you
Bitch

[Chorus]
Thank for making it hard to make it better for us
I was just trying to make some chitter for us
I'm a one woman man
But
When my one woman starts tripping
You can find where the strippers be striping
I went out to get it and I came back with it
I never complain I just handle my business
God is my witness
I'm a one woman man
But
When my one woman starts tripping
You can find where the strippers be striping

[Verse 3]
Our relationship faded
I wish we would have made it I sha hate it
But I got my sanity back and I wouldn't trade it
For a meal ticket, aren't no maybe we'll kick it
I don't want that
Like getting out of prison I'll do anything not to go back
Could it be meant for me to be one deep by myself while im awake and sleep
Thank to you I don't spend no more time try to please somebody else
Now all my time and effect is put into pleasing me
Straight up
I'm gone and your going to miss Joy'Mack(s)
Arent no use in calling my phone
Because there aren't no getting wrote back
I don't want to go to the movie or out to eat
Only way your going to see me
Is if you see me out in the street
I thought you was my future wife girl
But maybe my experience with you was
Peroration for me to find the right girl

[Bridge]
Me?
I'm going to miss you
But the size 12 can kick you where the good lord spilt you
Not trying to diss just telling you why I love you

[Chorus]
Thank for making it hard to make it better for us
I was just trying to make some chitter for us
I'm a one woman man
But
When my one woman starts tripping
You can find where the strippers be striping
I went out to get it and I came back with it
I never complain I just handle my business
God is my witness
I'm a one woman man
But
When my one woman starts tripping
You can find where the strippers be striping
