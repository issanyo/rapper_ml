(Verse 1)
I used to be a sucka for love
But I'm alright now
Ain't nothin important to me except codeine over ice now
Used to be a one woman man
But I can't see myself with the wife now
Fuck tryna please a muthafucka that can't be pleased
I'm living my life now
Take a time out to smell the roses
Living life one day at a time
An ungrateful bitch'll make a brotha get old quick
I was about to lose my mind
Silly me I was thinkin forever
The bitch was thinkin bout writin out chetta
But I ain't never been a trick bitch
Bottom line, you can't get shit bitch
Even my baby mama trippin, bitch go ahead and file on me
And I really don't give a fuck
Just as long as my child know me
What the fuck am I supposed to do?
Lord I know I need to be closer to you
Damn right I been slippin
Cuz I'm a christian, but I ain't livin like a christian
Spend my time with midnite women
Seem like every summer I'm in prison
But no weapon formed against me shall prosper
Keep God as ya man they can't stop ya
My grandmother told me the pillow don't give you love back
But god never took one of my ribs and made me a woman
Ima concentrate on my stacks

(Chorus)
I don't wanna die lonely
But them broads I deal with got me still singin I hate you bitch
I don't wanna die lonely
But I know 90 % of the hoes just fuck with Z-Ro tryin to get rich
I don't wanna die lonely
I'm in need of a womans touch but in 08 you just can't trust these hoes
I don't wanna die lonely
Ain't got no time to play no games I be damn if I let another bitch drive me insane
(Verse 2)
Why should I stress myself, when I know I need to be alone
What have you done for me lately
You ain't got no right to go through my phone, woman
Too many years I done paid the price
But my days of payin are gone
Cause I don't love you no more bitch
I'm about my money man
I would've givin you the world
But now you can't get a god damn, not from me man
I'm the man, I'm the boss, I'm the brotha that pays the cost
I really do give a damn about Joseph
If your not him, get off
What the fuck is a friend
Everybody I see, is pretend baby
And I'm a grown ass man today
But I been callin shots since a was ten baby
When I feel like fuckin
I'mma wrap a 100 dolla bill around my dick
Even though I got a life time supply
Bow ya heads for my nigga J. Prince
I'mma million dolla playa that's how I carry myself
And can't no woman have my heart cause I'mma merry myself

(Chorus)
I don't wanna die lonely
But them broads I deal with got me still singin I hate you bitch
I don't wanna die lonely
But I know 90 % of the hoes just fuck with Z-Ro tryin to get rich
I don't wanna die lonely
I'm in need of a womans touch but in 08 you just can't trust these hoes
I don't wanna die lonely
Ain't got no time to play no games I be damn if I let another bitch drive me insane
