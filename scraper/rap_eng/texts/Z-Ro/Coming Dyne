Feat. Slim Thug

(Hook x5)
Coming dyne and I'm flexin'
Haters mad and they plexin'
See the way I be commin' dyne
With them diamonds all on my necklace

(Verse)
Big money, bad bitches, a lot a diamonds, that's my life
It wasn't easy, I had to hustle, even kick a do' in or shoot them dice
No love for, anybody nigga, but I gotta hell of a lotta love for me, I
Sell drugs ta, everybody nigga, cause I gotta hell of a hustler in me, I

Roll around in a (conversion van), my whip game sick I got (Persian hands)
Fuck shortstoppin', I'm a long stop homie
This corner will never be yours again
Yeah I'm ridin' around and I'm gettin' it, Codeine fuckin' over my kidneys
And I ain't come here to play, I came here to handle my motherfuckin' business

(Hook x5)
Coming dyne and I'm flexin'
Haters mad and they plexin'
See the way I be commin' dyne
With them diamonds all on my necklace

(Verse)
Yeah
Mo' City, thats my hood I, neva eva eva eva claim another place
All my haters, they don't like that
But I'm throwin the (mills) in they motherfuckin' face
I'm at the intersection, expensive whip
Yellow diamonds make a red light look green
Swear to God thats a nice ass ride but the kid in the HID's make it look mean
I don't need no bodyguard, I thank you for watchin' ova my body Lord
I Got the 357 and the FN on me, 38 revolver my best friend homie
You thinkin bout tryn me then come on dyne
You ain't gotta wait, You can come on now
Fuck it, I'mma come to you, run in ya house
I murder everybody then I run on by
I am the Floyd Mayweather of rap in Houston Texas
Maybe that's the reason other rappers don't wanna give me dap in Houston Texas
I was built for this, they weren't built for this
Respect ain't just a (name gotta kill for it)
King of the Ghetto what they call me
And I ain't hide (every time I let em' all see)nigga

(Hook x5)
Coming dyne and I'm flexin'
Haters mad and they plexin'
See the way I be commin' dyne
