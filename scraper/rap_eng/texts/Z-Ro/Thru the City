[Chorus]
Everyday I ride Bentley through the fucking city babe
I remember when I couldn't ride a Bentley through the city babe
I remember when i couldn't afford to Uber through the city babe
Was asking you to come and get me but no gas money so you wouldn't do it babe
Everyday I ride Bentley through the fucking city babe
I remember when I couldn't ride a Bentley through the city babe
I remember when i couldn't afford to Uber through the city babe
Was asking you to come and get me but no gas money so you wouldn't do it babe

[Verse 1]
Styrofoam cup inside of Styrofoam cup
I don't need you to drop on the weed with me I buy my own drugs
You said I would never take off but right now it seems like right now i can't stop going up
And Like JJ Evans I'm Dyn-O-Mite cause seems like I can't stop blowing up
It's funny funny funny funny
The way you think you gon' get a verse for free
Cause I don't know you niggas if you ain't graduate from a real nigga university
I want my money money money money
That's the only thing that will work for me
And when I finish all my work and they put me in the dirt
Put my money in the dirt with me
Big old "B" in the middle of the wheel
Seventy grand in my pocket that shit ain't come from no deal
I don't fuck with you niggas no more so you say I am not real
Maybe the champagne bubbles and the hot tub bubbles is all I can feel
That's real

[Chorus]
Everyday I ride Bentley through the fucking city babe
I remember when I couldn't ride a Bentley through the city babe
I remember when i couldn't afford to Uber through the city babe
Was asking you to come and get me but no gas money so you wouldn't do it babe
Everyday I ride Bentley through the fucking city babe
I remember when I couldn't ride a Bentley through the city babe
I remember when i couldn't afford to Uber through the city babe
Was asking you to come and get me but no gas money so you wouldn't do it babe

[Verse 2]
All I need is my continental
It sends chills up my spine
Every time I touch that wood grain wheel
I own this bitch, this bitch ain't no rental
Rolling one deep for life
Fucking with phonys might get me killed
I blow kush smoke up in the air
Tan leather wrapped all around my chair
I love making these haters stop and stare
Shout out to god I'ma stop and say a prayer
And everytime I come down the avenue
Lettin' the top back is what I have to do
Bad bitches I will not chase after you
Even if you say "'Ro this sack is for you"
I'm one deep in my Bentley babe

[Chorus]
Everyday I ride Bentley through the fucking city babe
I remember when I couldn't ride a Bentley through the city babe
I remember when i couldn't afford to Uber through the city babe
Was asking you to come and get me but no gas money so you wouldn't do it babe
Everyday I ride Bentley through the fucking city babe
I remember when I couldn't ride a Bentley through the city babe
I remember when i couldn't afford to Uber through the city babe
Was asking you to come and get me but no gas money so you wouldn't do it babe

[Verse 3]
I wish you would have kept all of our business off of your Facebook
Cause it wasn't all about me it was about your Instagram and your Facebook
Why you gotta always let the laft hand know what the right hand doing
They be looking at me funny when I buy all this scotch
That's what the white man be doing
I'm supposed to pay my water bill light bill phone bill
Not supposed to pay hoes
I'll buy food hand from a bum before I pay these bitches to come up out they clothes
The pussy is free but my game ain't
Make your body end up where your brain ain't
Y'all shirley ass niggas ain't dranking  that's tasting eight days later still got the same drank
Drunk a thirty-seven, fucking right I did
Ain't no telling how many Dr Pepper's and Sprite's I did
My bank would come to the crib no more ATM's
And every night another bad bitch say rape me then
Two hundred more thousand, that was my afternoon
You a bad bitch but I gotta chase my money I would never chase after you

[Chorus]
Everyday I ride Bentley through the fucking city babe
I remember when I couldn't ride a Bentley through the city babe
I remember when i couldn't afford to Uber through the city babe
Was asking you to come and get me but no gas money so you wouldn't do it babe
Everyday I ride Bentley through the fucking city babe
I remember when I couldn't ride a Bentley through the city babe
I remember when i couldn't afford to Uber through the city babe
Was asking you to come and get me but no gas money so you wouldn't do it babe
