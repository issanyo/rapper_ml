[Chorus]
OG, OG, OG, OG
OG, OG, OG, OG

[Verse 1]
Mr Rogers ain't got shit on my neighborhood
We put bitch niggas in boxes, that's on my neighborhood
Soon as you talk down on Cuz, there goes the neighborhood
Pussy is cool, but drama gives me a major wood
Disrespecting the OG's, that ain't wise nigga
Turn around, nobodys there, turn around, turn right back around
Surprise nigga
They say it's over for Vandross, well they lied nigga
Who the fuck start shooting everybody in the parking lot that was my niggas
Better watch what you say about people like me
They won't even charge me they gon do it for free
Now you trying to apologize?
Oh you a bitch nigga just like I knew you would be
Better look both ways before you cross the street
Cause a nigga that's going bald might come and take you off your feet

[Chorus]
OG, OG, OG, OG
OG, OG, OG, OG

[Verse 2]
It's got to be a reason why I'm still here
All this fake shit somebody got to represent the real here
This street money my nigga, no record deal here
Y'all ain't no gangstas y'all some Women-men real queer
Daddy ain't raised me but my auntie did damn good
I'll never let you play me bitch I wish your ass would
And just to get my point across, I'll kill us all
On my way to get you somebody better get the laws
The fuck said I was too old, they better get it right
Still killing these rap niggas still killing young bitches every night
Look I ain't 40 yet but I got the .40 on me
So I don't move with 40 homies, I'm an OG

[Chorus]
OG, OG, OG, OG
OG, OG, OG, OG

[Outro]
Z-Ro that's a OG
Slim Thug that's a OG
Mike D that's a OG
Big Pokey that's a OG
RIP DJ Screw that's a OG
RIP Big Hawk that's a OG
RIP Big Moe that's a OG
RIP Fat Pat that's a OG
Y'all motherfuckers got the game fucked up
Who needs to sit down nigga? Still running circles around you motherfucking new booty ass niggas, nigga. Screwed Up Click for life One Deep Entertainment
If you knew better you would do better bitch
RIP Pimp C, all the fallen soldiers in the game
Any one of you old pussyfoot pussywillow ass niggas got something to say 'bout me?
Run on up nigga
I'll slide your bitch ass
