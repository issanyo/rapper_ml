How many niggas, wanna ride tonight
Fuck with me, it'll be a homicide tonight
I'ma make me a motherfucker, slide tonight
And put a swelling on his pimping, ride out tonight

[Z-Ro]
Back in 1994, I use to hustle all the time
Instead of a woman, Ro had making money on his mind
Now it's 2000 and 3, and ain't a thang changed
I'm still fishing for feddy, bringing to make brains hang
Nigga this Rap-A-Lot Mafia, for life my nigga
Fuck over us, and you'll be looking for your life my nigga
I garuntee, that you will lose it
(cause I'm a motherfucking fool with my hand tool, and I'm not afraid to use it)
Cause everyday, a nigga be busting for fun
When I be clutching my guns, bullets get stuck in they lungs
Who that talking down on the compound, what they smoking on
Mo City inner-circle, will leave a bitch with broken bones
United together, forever
As long as Little J give me the go-ahead, I'ma brandish my Baretta
So one mo' kill one mo' murder, one mo' homicide
Challenge my authority, and I'ma show you how to ride

[Hook]

[Z-Ro]
Mo City motherfucker, run and hide
I got 17 in the clip, plus I got one inside
The chamber leaving no remainders, I display myself
And put my mask on up in my glass house, like a receiver on my cash route
Until I'm paid, living in the ghetto is hard
So I take what I need, and seek forgiveness of the Lord
Can I get a blessing, niggas is stressing me out
But when I open fire, seem like they be helping me out
And not a nan-nother one of these fellas, be still bumping
Clear the parking lot, ain't nobody left but I'm still dumping
(automatic twin bitches, out the window
Cause I be tripping on that cousin, and that endo)
In a world of my own my nigga, I'm a G in these streets
And if you looking for me bitch, I'ma be in these streets
It ain't no hiding from the shadow of death, it's do or die
Go to war with a killa, and I'ma show you how to ride

[Hook]

[Z-Ro]
I'ma show you motherfuckers, how to ride
Let a motherfucker disrespect me, I'ma show a motherfucker how to slide
(hoping some of that, cause I will lose it
Got a firearm, and I'm able to use it)
Shoot first, and never ask questions later on
This life I'm living, one day you here the next day you gone
Become a memory fucking with me, plus I'm thugging to the finish line
Fuck what they going through, they gon give me mine
A ton and a half, of leave me alone
Coming at me your members too nervous, to come see me alone
Where the real niggas at, where the real niggas at
Cause these coward motherfuckers, got me watching my back
And everytime, I woop a nigga's ass
I gotta watch out for the reprocussion, don't be a victim when a bitch nigga blast
I'm on my P's and Q's, at all times
Come and see me motherfucker, I'ma show you how to ride

[Hook]

(*talking*)
How many niggas wanna ride tonight, fucking with Z-Ro
It's fa sho, to be a homicide tonight
I be damned, if I let a motherfucker get out of line with me
And I don't pull his co-tail, fuck around and slap the shit out a motherfucker
Bitch you better back-back, give me fifty
Mo' than fifty feet though, bitch you better give me fifty mo'fucking kilometers
Give me fifty miles mo'fucker, you don't wanna be around me man
When my face frown up, cause your bitch ass'll be face up from the ground up
Feel me R.I.P., rest in peace hoe ass niggas
