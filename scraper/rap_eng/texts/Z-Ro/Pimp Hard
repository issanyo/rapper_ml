[Verse 1 - Scarface]
I use to watch you on stage gettin'money, lookin lovely
Got these niggas offerin they pockets tippin you twenties
Cause you cold with that shit that you do...ya mood shocked me
Unlike these other hoes in ya crew you don't jock me
I'd like to get ya phone number just to see what you about
Call you for breakfast to get you out
And see if you just some eyes without a face
Let me see ya crib - take me to ya place
I wanna show you that it's mo'to me then fuckin on my mind
Cause in yo mind I bet you fuckin all the time
Come to find you only out tryin to go to school
And tryna go to school and pay bills is hard to do
I see you fool so go on and do ya thing
But when you tired of showin ya titties give me a ring
I like a woman gettin hers cause that's better
Then her tryna come up off mine I can't let her

[Hook - Bun B sampled]
Go on and let a nigga peak, and let a nigga poke
Go on get naked for me streak, and let a nigga stroke(Repeat 4x)

[Verse 2 - Z-Ro]
Go on and let a nigga peak, go on and let a nigga poke
Give me some assistance as I manuver my long stroke
I hope you don't think I'm payin'for it that's the wrong hope
Cause I know you wanna be Z'Rollin over chrome spokes
Bitch I know you wanna tell ya girlfriends how it was
To get hit from the back, in the back of the 'Lac by a thug
And to get ran through until you get carpet burns off the rug
And to get nutted on by nine niggas with diamond grills and guns
And how you got on my microphone and sung a sixteen
Ya performance deserves a grammy check out my big screen
Most bitches don't know but you know what suckin a dick mean
Yeah the head was fed but what up with that in them jeans
I can see the pussy (?)lookin like a big bee
Make ya cycle start early my shovel be diggin deep
I don't wanna relationship, I just want me some relations
Go on and let a nigga poke ho, and stop shuckin with my patience

[Verse 3 - Pimp C]
Bitch get down on me at the drop of a dime
Fuck all that R & B singin shit I ain't got the time
I'd rather bust yo'ass up with some screwed and chopped
Let me test ya jaws and let me stretch out ya cotton
I'm still Pimp C bitch, the name ain't changed
Puttin stick up in these hoes don't remember they name
Cause we tired of playin games with them booty lickers
Cause we jumped up in ya life, cause I'm a true dirt digger
So go on hit the streets, break them lame tricks
Then bring it back to daddy that's how you can get this dick
I need the cash first - and the ass last
And we can blow dro in the Benz while I smash on the gas
So let a nigga pimp, and let a nigga mack
And later on tonight you can get hit up in ya back...and get ya money back
But when I make ya pussy skeet bitch you gon'buy me a 'Lac

[Verse 4 - Juvenile]
I ain't tryna talk a hole in yo head
But I can tell you didn't excel what them hoes done said
Starrin at my neck and my wrist cause my shit is frozen red
And I look like a easy hustler so go ahead
Ya leavin the same way ya met me
You gon'be grievin if you sex me, while I'm schemin on the next piece
I'll poke ya cookie I don't give a fuck who know this
Who up in the area that aknowledge what a ho is
All my warriors is lovin my rep
How I took it to the world from the project steps
Playin touch with my broad like my children
And it ain't like back in the days when we ducked behind buildings
I be a threat to tell a broad what I'm feeling
Especially if she poor and she need to be gettin no bullshittin
She ever fix her mouth for some money it's good with me
I ain't the one what you need is a stool pigeon

[Verse 5 - Petey Pablo]
If you think I'm a treat a bitch with high price drawls
Any differance then the way I treat the grandma's on
How many ways is there to say that you terribly wrong
Would you understand me better if I just said "naw"
Fuck what another motherfucker told y'all
That's tipical talk when they dick hard
They just wanna little pussy mama that's all
It's like fourth down, two yards fuck it they goin for it
How am I payin'for it?, and how much you charge for it?
It ain't about being a whore that's what it's made for
Get ya paper baby fuck what the world say
Get ya bills paid....okay!
