[Intro]
Synesthetic, synesthetic

[Verse 1]
Uhh, fucking right, this is my block and I'm gon' rep this bitch
I'm always on my Houston Texas, Mo City Texas shit
All that real shit I talk, a fake nigga you ain't never gon' catch me with
Even if it's my relative, they be like "Ro, let me live!"
Homie think I owe him somethin', cuz we started this shit together
And then he was gone, but my hustle went on, that's why I ended up with the cheddar
He look at me like I'm s'pposed to be givin' him somethin'
I L-O-L 'cause I would never
Jealous ass always be talkin' about me simply because I am doin' so much better
I'm so glad I ain't a roach ass nigga, baby
He just mad 'cause he a broke ass nigga, baby
I thank God I ain't gotta sell dope no mo', I sell myself now
Never needed yo' help in the beginnin', and I still don't need yo' fucking help now

[Chorus]
Solid, and I'm all about my dough
Nu'n but loud, that's all I blow
I don't fuck with y'all no mo'
I am solid
Killers with me everywhere I go
Who say they got beef with Ro, bet you won't see them no mo'
I am solid
And I don't trip over no hoe and I ain't never been no hoe
Keep it real, that's all I know
I am solid
So don't come knockin' at my do', 'cause you know you ain't my bro
You mean nothin' to Z-Ro
Solid as a rock

[Verse 2]
You gon' do what I say do, would you gon' fuckin' leave?
All that shit you was talkin', now you can't fuckin' breathe
Homicide don't know what to do, cuz they ain't got no fuckin' lead
I bet in the next life you know better than to fuck with me
I run this city, run this side of town
I run this neighborhood, I run this block
If you wanna get some money over here
You gotta leave some money over here, if not you gon' get shot
Got you and your people doin' the Mannequin Challenge
You niggas really in the 6 ft zip lock
Murder all of you motherfuckers just for steppin' on my property, I'm the landlord on this block
And you don't wanna get me started
I might show love to my people, but I am oh so heartless
Takin' haters out like it's Monday morning and they are garbage
If I gotta come getcha, I'ma just come getcha, won't be no warning

[Chorus]
Solid, and I'm all about my dough
Nu'n but loud, that's all I blow
I don't fuck with y'all no mo'
I am solid
Killers with me everywhere I go
Who say they got beef with Ro, bet you won't see them no mo'
I am solid
And I don't trip over no hoe and I ain't never been no hoe
Keep it real, that's all I know
I am solid
So don't come knockin' at my do', 'cause you know you ain't my bro
You mean nothin' to Z-Ro
Solid as a rock

[Outro]
Solid
Uhh, I don't give a fuck what you niggas think about me
Fuck all y'all, it ain't no smokin' and drinkin' for free
Solid
You got me fucked up, e'ryone of y'all motherfuckers run up on me gon' get fucked up
Solid
It ain't no love, I ain't runnin' in none of you bitches if I ain't got no glove
Solid
And you niggas is sorta squishy
Talkin' 'bout what you gon' do when you see me
I'm waitin' on you to come get me
Well...
