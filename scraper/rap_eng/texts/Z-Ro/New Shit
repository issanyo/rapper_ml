[Hook]
If you don't like my new shit you can go back to my old shit
Matter fact y'all haters ain't gotta jam none of my shit
Y'all haters can eat my whole dick
I don't do this for y'all
Gotta get this money, gotta get this money mayne
Gotta get this money, gotta get this money mayne
Gotta get this money, gotta get this money mayne
Gotta get this money, gotta get this money mayne

[Verse 1]
Listen, if you were struggling, back in '97 when I started this
And your ass still struggling in 2016, you hustle is garbage bitch
I can't stay in the same old place, I gotta keep on movin'
And since the music keep on playing I gotta keep on groovin'
That's why I keep on winning and these bitch niggas keep on losing
And FYI I've been single since 97, that's why I keep on doin'
They keep on killin' me but I keep on livin', that's what I keep on doing
It's me against the world like 2Pac Shakur
So anybody can get it, give them 2 shots or more
[?] if you ever wonder why I didn't ever come around
Cause your moma be like fuck you, nigga we don't ever want you to come around
And Paris I found out 'bout you when you were damn near grown
I promise these baby momas these days ain't worth the flesh that they are printed on

[Hook]
If you don't like my new shit you can go back to my old shit
Matter fact y'all haters ain't gotta jam none of my shit
Y'all haters can eat my whole dick
I don't do this for y'all
Gotta get this money, gotta get this money mayne
Gotta get this money, gotta get this money mayne
Gotta get this money, gotta get this money mayne
Gotta get this money, gotta get this money mayne

[Verse 2]
You can say what you want about me, I don't mind
Cause I'm a diamond homie, I'll be damned if I don't shine
40000 people holdin' my legs, I'm still gon' climb
And even though they got their own homie, they still want mine
I heard Z-Ro ain't this and Z-Ro ain't that
Z-Ro ain't havin' no money and Z-Ro can't rap
Z-Ro don't give a damn 'long as he roll make stacks
His credit card ain't got a color, how the fuck you love that?
Foreign cars that's all I'm ridin'
I hear you haters talkin' funny, that's why I be smiling, cheese
If money come in two's then haters come in three's
But without them there's no me
I love my haters

[Hook]
If you don't like my new shit you can go back to my old shit
Matter fact y'all haters ain't gotta jam none of my shit
Y'all haters can eat my whole dick
I don't do this for y'all
Gotta get this money, gotta get this money mayne
Gotta get this money, gotta get this money mayne
Gotta get this money, gotta get this money mayne
Gotta get this money, gotta get this money mayne

[Verse 3]
Grown men gossiping 'bout other grown men
Ain't that what bitches do? Then y'all niggas ain't grown men
I hate to say it but I got niggas on my team that be watching my pocket
They don't put in the work like I put in the work
But they want what I got in my pocket
Y'all can keep on talkin' cause y'all just talkin' and that's a damn shame
Nobody know y'all in home
But I'll do Africa, they know my damn name
Takin' over this world with real nigga music, that's my plan mane
Players do what we wanna do and y'all haters do what y'all can mane

[Hook]
If you don't like my new shit you can go back to my old shit
Matter fact y'all haters ain't gotta jam none of my shit
Y'all haters can eat my whole dick
I don't do this for y'all
Gotta get this money, gotta get this money mayne
Gotta get this money, gotta get this money mayne
Gotta get this money, gotta get this money mayne
Gotta get this money, gotta get this money mayne
