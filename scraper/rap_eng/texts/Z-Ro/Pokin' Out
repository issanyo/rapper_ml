[Verse 1: Slim Thug]
Hold up! What you know about slab, 4s pokin' out?
Spokes dissin', it's tradition dyne in the south
When I pull out, they say look at the wheels
I hopped out, lookin' like a mill, still
Work that wood wheel like I'm in the Coupe DeVille
But this time that Coupe cost me like a half a mill
They like "hi, is this fo' real?" They ain't even got a deal
Been killing boys since I had the braids and grills, yeah
This for the trill down in Texas, still ridin' reckless
Me and Ro still makin' know the world respect us
Ridin' in my slab, pourin' up, smokin' out
Fresh set of vogue still, and they pokin' out

[Hook x2]
We pokin'', pokin' out, ridin' in my slab, wood grain I grab
Pokin', pokin' out, comin' down that ave
Pullin' on a swagger's ave

[Verse 2: Z-Ro]
Woman, I know you want a ride, stop boppin', hop yo' ass inside
And you can roll with a playa
Maybe now you can see why my nose in the air
Oh my god, it's so much wood in here
You may not smell it, but you know I got that good in here
(Hold up) Keep that in, hit that, nigga where it go?
Hit that, hit, get that, nigga there it go!
I name all my craddle cats, if it ain't custom, it ain't Rother
Sick girls hangin' ova the yellow line, even though they're not supposed to
Write my ticket and let me go, know bout my business, kiss
Sent out to miss, your noggin is too big, everyone bringin' they business in

[Hook x2]

[Verse 3: Paul Wall]
I pull up pokin' like a cactus, jammin' Fat Patrick
With an actress, sideways on the tilted axis
Cup holder got drank spills and blunt ashes
My backseat is a custom sleep number mattress
Hand-crafted leather stitching with the custom pipes
Matching halo lights, wait til you see it at night
