[Hook: Z-Ro & Lil O]
I can't leave drank alone
It got me feening
Feeling like a boss
While I'm flippin' through my hood
I can't leave drank alone
You got a nigga feening
(Ain't even goin to lie this drank gots me feeling
Like I'm walking on the sky)

[Verse 1: Z-Ro]
Yall would think that with 3 felony cases
I would leave drank alone
I'm still out on bond
And ima keep dranking till all the drank is gone
Damn right I'm high as the sky be
Over g4 and g5 that's where I be
And then it's back to reality
Cuz I could hear the sirens
Woot woot dam HPD right behind me
I got a little weed and a pint and a half
But thanks to don I got a stash spot
And since my doctor wrote me this prescription
Ain't no body got to bail my ass out
Still rolling in that three-double-o
With my name in my grille on top of 'fours
And I'm in love with mary jane and codeine
I don't love these hoes
I can remember my first cup, oh I was so in love
So when I wake up in the morning
Before I brush my teeth I'm pouring up
Lil momma you a dime piece
But I'll fuck you up if you touch my cup
Cuz it ain't cheap as it used to be
And this one cost 350 bucks
Me and dj screw poured up a pint
On my twenty second birthday
And that day was a monday
But a nigga didn't wake up until thursday
I handle my business
So I think I deserve to get throwed
So I'ma Barre Baby now just like my nigga Big Moe

I can't leave drank alone

Like I'm walking on the sky)


[Verse 2: Lil O]
Sippin on the ski taste
Heading to the weed place
This boys think they ball baby
They should see what we waste
Some pints of that drank
Zips of the dro
Cup so muddy
Told your bitch to hit it slow
Top down on 59
You know I'm tippin slow
I could hear HAWK sayin
(Mayne your trippin o
Slow your ass down mayne)
But me I'm like fuck it
I got money in my pocket and
Tonight it's going down
Cuz you know I like sipping
On that purple stuff
Purple kush in my bong
Till the purple cross
And the babies in the city
Won't flirt with us
Five kilos ima take
To put in work for us
With some down side busters
We gon stay pouring up
Ask about O mayne
I stay showing up
If I see 2 litres
I gotta 4' it up
If you wanna ride with money
Then you better ride with us
Cuz we be sippin on big drank daily
Yelling to the haters fuck you baby
Lil o and ro we don't play G
For real
