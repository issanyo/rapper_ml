Ain't no love.....
Do she really love me or the fame?
Ain't no love.....
And would my niggas, still be my niggas if I didn't pay for everythang?
Ain't no love, love, love, love; do she really love me or the fame...?
And would my niggas, still be my niggas if I didn't pay for everythang?


[Verse 1]
Told the bitch not to do it but the bitch did it anyway
Then she wonder why when she talk to me I'm like "Anyway..."
'Are you walkin' away from me, Joseph?' I'm like "Bitch, anyway.."
Break up with me then, to me, I was still single anyway...
We ain't engaged, we just engage; that's it--
Make sure you cum after I come; I'm on my way, that's it
And the same time tomorrow we can do it again
Make love to you or fuck the shit out you and ya friend...
15 years old-- I was already keepin' it real
And 22 years later, that's how I'm keepin' it still
Definition of an OG, baby, you should already know
I don't want no ass; gimme my cash, I'm out the do'....

[Verse 2]
I wish a bitch even act like she gon' touch my phone
Knock her ass out-- I hope I don't fuck up my phone
She wanna know if her homegirls numbers fill up my phone
So many relationships within, if I give up my phone
Niggas would be so mad at me but they stay mad at me anyway
Sayin' what they gon' do to Z-Ro, Z-Ro be like, "Anyway.."
Get rich or get rich-- fuck dyin', I'm like, "Anyway"
Can't even concentrate on fuckin', I'm like, "Bitch, anyway.."
Get the fuck up off me, hoe, I'm a mother fuckin' hustler...
No disrespect but I need to be with my customers....
I'm addicted to blue bills, Macallan 18 and a few pills--
Ain't never gave a fuck about what the world doin' and I promise that's what I do still....

Z-Ro the Crooked
AKA the Mo' City Don
'Ro-ther Vandross...
The one thing 'Ro-ther Vandross never, ever, ever, ever, ever do?
Is show love.... That's showin' weakness, ya dig?
My backbone straight; don't ever bend, ya feel me?
Cuz, uh... once you bend, it's too hard to go back straight, ya feel?
Vandross...
No love for a nigga, and no love for a bitch, ya dig?
