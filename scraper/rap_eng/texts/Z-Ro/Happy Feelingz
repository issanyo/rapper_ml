Lately, my luck has taken a turn for the worse
I used to ride in luxury now I'm headed for a hearse
At least it feels that way; my day-to-day is full of sufferin'
My headaches can't be relieved by aspirin or Bufferin
Am I tougher than my problems? I like to think so
But every time I try to rise all I do is sink slow
Like I'm out in the Pacific and my vessel capsized
Seems like I been going through it since I got baptized
Mr. Jesus I can feel him all up in my bones
Cause he be giving me game on how to live my life long
Can't forget about the angels at the psychiatric center
Helping me to feel like I'm a winner
Got me taking Lexapro, just so I can improve my mood
It got me feeling like I'm giant, all obstacles better move
Or get flattened in the process of me reachin' to the top
Y'all know that I'm the cream of the crop
And all my people say...

Getcho' ass up out my way Satan
I got a mansion, robe, and a crown waitin'
Never again will you catch me livin' in sin
Cause when the pearly gates open I wanna be steppin' in
Getcho' ass up out my way Satan
I got a mansion, robe, and a crown waitin'
I do away with you devils so I can make it to the top
And remain sane even when a nigga dealing with a lot

I'm all alone but guess what that's all right
Facing my fears and producing tears that's all night
Yeah I'm a grown man but I still cry sometimes
Cause I'm a sponge soaking up pain trying to come out the rain
I been doing right all my life and still sufferin'
While murders and crooks out there bubblin'
I need a break, so many decisions to make
I can't concentrate, cause everybody in my life is so fake
All the years that I wasted lovin' and tryin' to build
With somebody who was never even feeling me for real
I thought I had a family but out the window it went
With all my legal problems and all this beefin with thirty cents
I'm a loner, pillow to post, solo on the corner
Bitch don't know nothing 'bout Joseph she just want "Z-Ro" to bone her
But I'm old school till I'm in my burial plot
I just need a lady to dig me when I'm dealin' with a lot

Ain't no happy feelingz in the air
So lately I been searching for happiness through my prayers
Holy Father, can you hear me when I'm down on my knees?
I need a bridge over troubled water, save me please
I'm just a lost soul tryin' to find his way back home
Everything I love has been takin' away from me now I'm alone
But it's all good, tell me when the sun gon' shine
On this nothing ass motherfuckin life of mine
Mama it been 20 years since I seen yo face
Do me a favor, ask god if I'm included in his grace
Cause I'm feeling abandoned like the last man standing
So much poverty and pain this ain't the way that I planned it
All I wanted was to make a little money and split
Take care of my people and grow old with grandchildren and shit
I'm still happy, even if my cases don't get dropped
And remain sane even when a nigga dealing with a lot
