[Verse 1]
Yeah!
I know y'all wonder why a nigga wanna retire I can't stand this shit
If it ain't Mike D, if it ain't Slim Thug I just can't understand this shit
Hell yeah I been better than everybody forever but I really didn't plan this shit
Always been number one even though I wasn't running standing still I still ran this shit
Turning up before they turned up
When they was activator curl permed up
They was talking bout Texas niggas couldn't rap
But I made these motherfuckers learn us
We was street niggas, concrete niggas
Even though they tried they couldn't turn us
Fuck these rapping niggas, I was slapping niggas, when I came around 'em they were nervous
They say 'Ro ain't the best, he is just depressed
He ain't got it all, he is just a mess
He don't give a fuck what you say about him
Long as empire still cut the check
Like they blindfolded, no rubber on
They don't really know who they are fucking with
I am Michael Jordan I retire
Come back and retire again for the fuck of it

[Chorus]
He's not done yet
He's not done yet
He's not done yet, uh uh!
He's not done yet
He's not done yet
He's not done yet
He's not done yet, uh uh!
He's not done yet

[Verse 2]
Mo city Texas that's where I come from I never been a bitch
Throw grenades hoe fuck a Draco
I'm killing everybody with this shit
I don't play right broad daylight
I give a fuck about the witnesses
Pull up and unload leave 'em slumped over
First you see me then I'm in the wind
Since I dropped Look What You Did To Me in 1998 I been a ghost
Give a bitch hard dick or hard times
Its too goddamn hard for me to give her my dough
They call me the king of the ghetto
Forever never gonna be another that can sit on my throne
When I'm in my casket they gon' still be asking me to make another song won't leave me alone
I'm way too solid baby
I ain't never been to college baby, but I got a degree
I got a lot of street knowledge baby
From a nigga named DJ Screw
If it ain't him I be like DJ who?
He always told me to keep it real I'm a do what he say do
And motherfuckers better get out the way
Get your ass rolled over you better move when he say move

[Chorus]
He's not done yet
He's not done yet
He's not done yet
He's not done yet
He's not done yet
He's not done yet
He's not done yet
He's not done yet
