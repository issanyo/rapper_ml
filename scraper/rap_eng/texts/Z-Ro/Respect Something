[Chorus]
Y'all niggas better act like y'all respect something round here
(DJ Drama Queen) (around here)
Cause a nigga will never hesitate (hesitate)
Disrespect and I'm going up in your chest plate (chest plate)
(Just tryin to maintain)

Y'all niggas better act like y'all respect something round here (around here)
Gots to be a G to the day that I'm gone (gone)
Show you better than I can tell you
This ain't just a song (song)

[Z-Ro]
Just tryin to maintain
Tryin to keep from goin in a bitch niggas brain
Seem like Rap-A-Lot ain't comin up with the change
(ain't comin up with the change) Ain't that a bitch
Every since 2004 I was supposed to be rich
Y'all already know my name
I release nothing but hits
And these niggas hate me cause they baby mamas on my dick
I'm a G, never been a H-O-E
Sippin codeine and smokin weed
Rest In Peace to my brother M-O-E, Disco Danny
We ridin on 4's and the 300 is candy
Them jackas wanna trip I keep the ammunition handy
Screwed-Up-Click until I die
Man I'm so high
I don't think I can drive
That's why I'm ridin shot gun with my shotgun
One niggas disreespect can get ya hold block done, done done,done

[Chorus]
Y'all niggas better act like y'all respect something round here (around here)
Cause a nigga will never hesitate (hesitate)
Disrespect and I'm going up in your chest plate (chest plate)
(Just tryin to maintain)

Y'all niggas better act like y'all respect something round here (around here)
Gots to be a G to the day that I'm gone (gone)
Show you better than I can tell you
This ain't just a song

[Billy Cook]

Ooohh
You bitches don't want none
I'm busting my tommy Gun
Snitches you better run
Slap haters for fun
I'm an R&B gangsta
Respect my gangsta
A MoCity Heavyweighta
All bout my Paper
I ain't takin shit from you bitches no more
Sometimes too these niggas really be hoes
You wanna be fake tight
All about the limelight
Artist wanna be all up in my spotlight
You's a ho in my book
Con artist and a crook
Six years of my trust that a bitch nigga took
I ain't playin no games
Want a 100 fuck change
I ain't playin no games
Want a 100 fuck change
Y'all niggas betta act like y'll respect something around here
Gots to be a G to the day that I'm gone
Show you better than I can tell you
This ain't just a song

[Chorus]
Y'all niggas better act like y'all respect something round here (around here)
Cause a nigga will never hesitate (hesitate)
Disrespect and I'm going up in your chest plate (chest plate)

Y'all niggas better act like y'all respect something round here (around here)
Gots to be a G to the day that I'm gone (gone)
Show you better than I can tell you
This ain't just a song

[Z-Ro]
This is My World
Z-Ro King of the Ghetto, thats right (that's right)
King of the Ghetto Entertainment in this bitch tonight (tonight)
I'm a gangsta
Pussy niggas better stay up out my way (way)
Frown on my face I'm holding my AK (AK)
Handlin business diggin ditches evryday (day)
Heyy, whenever you motherfuckers used to call my phone
I never told you no (no)
Now the same motherfuckers left me all alone
That's why my name is Z-Ro (Ro)
It ain't nobobody but me in my world (world)
I'm not worried about anybody fucking my girl (girl)
You can have that ho mayne (mayne)
I just want the dough mayne (mayne)
MoCity in this bitch
It's Billy Cook and Z-Ro mayne (mayne)

[Chorus]
Y'all niggas better act like y'all respect something round here (around here)
Cause a nigga will never hesitate (hesitate)
Disrespect and I'm going up in your chest plate (chest plate)

Y'all niggas better act like y'all respect something round here (around here)
Gots to be a G to the day that I'm gone (gone)
Show you better than I can tell you
This ain't just a song
