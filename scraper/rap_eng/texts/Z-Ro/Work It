Now if you want it
You gotta work it
Now if you want it
You gotta work it

[D-Reck]
Slow down mama, let me tell you one thang
If you wanna know me, you gotta know the game
There's a whole lot come, with this fortune and fame
Some dogs just can't, be careful with change
Got too many women, so they say I'm no good
Making too much paper, so I'm misunderstood
But I spit it like I get it, and I'm good with the wood
When I hit it I ain't quit it, till I know she into it
She shakes she shivers, she fill like a river
She upset she stress, trying to catch me slipping
She fiending she scheming, trying to get this thug
But she knew what it was, when she met this thug

Now if I hit it, I ain't gon quit it
Girl I'ma get it, hot as a skillet
Now when I drill it, I'ma make you spill it
Girl you gon feel it, that's on the real yeah

[Cl'Che]
Boy you gotta drop it, if you trying to hit it
You gotta work your mouth, down in the Dirty 3rd we call the South
You want a classy chick, you want a nasty chick
You gotta gotta know, what you working with
Cause I'm a choosey chick, I'm a Gucci chick
And I taking no small, mmmm

[Z-Ro]
I'ma work it anyway, you ain't got to beg
Legs behind your head, on the edge of your bed
Steady pumping and I'm bumping, and I'm leaving it red
Whooping the life out the butt, now and leaving it dead
Telling me what I got to do, to get ass
Only thing I got to do, is get cash
Might get some hydro, or get some hash
I don't need no viagra, to help me last
You bout to get done, when you get on top
Give it about three seconds, you'll be on bottom
If we ever get into it, you'll take it to heart
And wanna take me to war, and you'll be on cock

Now if I hit it, I ain't gon quit it
Girl I'ma get it, hot as a skillet

[Noke D]
Now I don't want you, to get the wrong idea
I ain't trying to make no, love in here
Mr. Thugger man, baby have no fear
I'm hitting and I'm getting, up out of here
Now I don't really mean, no disrespect
But you gotta bend, your back and neck
It's so good, I wanna show D-Reck
Just for a sec, let him feel the wet
And before we go, you gotta let Z-Ro
Bend you over, touch your toes
'Case you didn't know, we call em run through
Just what you, just let us do

Now if I hit it, I ain't gon quit it
Girl I'ma get it, hot as a skillet
Now when I drill it, I'ma make you spill it
