I wish you would die
Bitch I know you had that baby try to ruin my life
But it’s all good
But I wish you would die
Bitch I know you had that baby try to ruin my life
I know I shoulda  wore a rubber
I thought you were my girl so I was yo naked headed lover
I didn’t know that you were thinking payday
Bitch you gone be screaming mayday
Trying to fuck over Joseph  McVey,  girl
Now I hope you get run over by a Metro bus
Yo life ain’t worth a fuck

[Verse 2: Z-Ro]
I've been nothing but real with you
But ya changed on me
Now I wanna knock out all your teeth whenever I deal with you
Ha ha, it ain't even about that money
Cuz you ain't getting nothing just a week of gas money
So fill up yo car
Oops, my bad, you ain't even got one
I hate you bitch
If you needed a ride I wouldn't take you bitch
I hope dogs with rabies, gang rape you bitch
If I see someone killing you I won’t save you bitch
Take this  two hundred and thirteen dollars
And  see if that’s gone take the place of her having a father (yeah)
And before I forget, you need stop calling my cell phone begging for dick (yeah)

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Z-Ro]
I used to cut for you scissors now bitch
Now I hate yo ass for trying to kill me with a child bitch
You don’t even want that baby you just want that money
Man this some wild shit
I didn't wanna be yo man so you got them child support papers filed quick
I’m singing goddamn , that’s all I can say
You and the attorney general trying to get me to pay all I can pay
So you can get your hair done
And get your nails done and get a new dress
But you ain't bought nothing for that little girl yet
What was different about this time is you didn't wanna get up
I mean I know my dick is great but I'm like still what the fuck
(Well you should of wore a rubber, you need to shut the fuck up)
But usually you hop off my dick and suck my nutt the fuck up
So don’t be asking me why you and the baby ain't coming to visit
Cuz I really wanna grab my pistol and then cock it back and put one in your kidney
Bitch you get no love acting a fool with me
When a woman ain't acting like a woman that shit ain't cool with me
