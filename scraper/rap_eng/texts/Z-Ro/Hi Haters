B-b-b-beanz N Kornbread

[Chorus: Z-Ro & Kam Franklin]
You can say what you wanna say about me
I don't give a damn
Come for me if you wanna come for me
God rollin' wit me, here I am
Hi haters (Hi haters), how y'all doin'? (How y'all doin'?)
Me, I'm just ballin' (I'm just ballin')
I love ya, haters

[Verse 1: Z-Ro]
I can't hear my haters no mo'
'Cause they can't afford to go places that Ro go
But I really miss my haters, no homo
Mad at me cause I'm rich and they ain't got no dough
They just hate me cause they ain't me
But maybe I'm what they can't be
They pay me to see me I don't pay to see somebody
You ain't gotta hate no more
I can show you how to be somebody
I know I got a lot of people wanna see me down
But they see what they wanna be when they see me now
They try so hard to make it hard for me
I will never bow down to man that's something only God will see

[Chorus: Z-Ro & Kam Franklin]
You can say what you wanna say about me
I don't give a damn
Come for me if you wanna come for me
God rollin' wit me, here I am
Hi haters (hi haters), how y'all doin (how y'all doin)
Me, I'm just ballin' (I'm just ballin')
I love ya, haters

[Verse 2: Z-Ro & Kam Franklin]
Don't need nothing from you I am okay
Cause you know you don't fuck with me the long way
They like "Why that  hoe ass nigga got his own day"
And that's why I don't be fuckin' with my homies
I'm good
You can keep them phony handshakes
I'm good
Squeeze yo shit so hard I hope yo hand breaks
I'm good
I eat lobster you can keep yo pancakes
Don't even know why I got a phone
I want all y'all to leave me alone
Always talkin' about yo friend that shit ain't cool (That ain't cool)
But when yo friend find out you act like it ain't you (It ain't you, no)
Kickin' it with y'all haters is something I can't do (I can't do)
But please forgive them lord they know not what they do, yeah

[Chorus: Z-Ro & Kam Franklin]
You can say what you wanna say about me
I don't give a damn
Come for me if you wanna come for me
God rollin' wit me, here I am
Hi haters (Hi haters), how y'all doin (How y'all doin)
Me, I'm just ballin' (I'm just ballin')
I love ya, haters
