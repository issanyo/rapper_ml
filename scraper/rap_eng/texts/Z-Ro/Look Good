[Intro]
What’s crackin ho
Yeah you bitch
Yeah this the same nigga that’ll sell blood to a bitch on her period, ya dig
Rother Vandross
Hold up touch keep  your mother fucking  hands off
Teddy Pinchagram what they got me on the weekend
Well if you don’t look good then I don’t look good
And that’s impossible bitch cuz I'm stunning

[Hook]
If you don’t look good
Then I don’t look good
Now we don’t look good, that’s right
If you don’t look good
Then I don’t look good
Bitch you better bring me my cheese
If you don’t look good

Now we don’t look good, that’s right
If you don’t look good
Then I don’t look good
Bitch you better bring me my cheese

[Verse 1: Z-RO]
I don’t love you
Matter of fact I don’t ever think of you
I can think of better shit for me to do
Like chasing a million dollars with my mother fucking crew
I miss my nigga D.J. Screw
Thirty miles per hour on the freeway fool
Leaning like we needed VA
But I always kept my eyes open to make sure we straight
Now  Im the Mo City Don
I got my crown homie
Watch your mouth unless you wanna be underground homie
If this your bitch come get her cuz once I set her down homie
Then your bitch gone be my bitch all you can do is frown homie
We can handle this like men or get in to gangster shit
Five deuce Hoover crip down right I’m a gangster bitch
Lips, hips and finger tips make a gangster rich
All these yellow, blue and black diamonds I’ve sold, thank you bitch

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Z-RO]
All I want is the money you can keep the rest
Don’t give a damn about which one of ya'll freak the best
Don’t want it in public don’t even want no secret sex
Cash only bitch you fired if you try to give me a check, yeah
My blood homie wanna red bitch
My loc homie wanna go fed with that head bitch
Me I want a go get it and come back with the bread bitch
She want your credit card fuck your  bracelet and your necklace
But she’ll rob for that too if you leave it out
She’s a real prostitute her pussy she just leave it out
Bottom line my ho ain't trying to see me without
I think there’s paper round that corner ho go peep it out
But I don’t love her,  I love what she done for me
Told the pimp police she my sister and hid my guns for me
She’ll shoot it out with me if my enemies come for me
Bottom bitch get what she want long as she get the funds for me, ya dig

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Z-RO]
Homie got you walking in some white girl
Fuck with me I’ll have ya looking like one of the Spice Girls
Ya dead with that nigga with me your living life girl
Chunk homie the deuces, it’s time to get it right girl
That ain't a thousand dollar bag that’s a backpack
No gorilla pimping ain't gunna do you like Kat Stacks
That ain't a group of bad bitches that’s a rat pack
Leave the broke ho’s where they at and go bring a stack back
Just don’t be kissing on me find a trick and kiss him
If a bitch paying you take her pussy lips and lick them
A lot diamonds in his watch but his wrist dim
You should fuck with me I’m really pimping
Chilling with my broad and you already know
When homie I don’t love her you can have that ho
If you paying her money she’s coming through your front door
Then it’s back to the south
She see Z-Ro and shes giving me all the doe

[Hook]
