[Hook: Chamillionaire & (Z-Ro)]
Don't try to knock the hustle cause you just wastin' your time
I'm cooler than Denzel Washington with mine
I know I'm a player
(I know I'm a player)
I know I'm a money makin' player, so player
(Don't try to knock the hustle cause you just wastin' your time
I'm cooler than Denzel Washington with mine)
I know I'm a player
(I know I'm a player
I know I'm player so you haters, your just wastin' your time)

[Verse 1: Chamillionaire]
I keep that wallet with the ward so I'm ridin' with the noise
Plus the clip is fully loaded it's thee inside of my garage
Cars, look at all my broads if you tryin' to see the stars
Find me & you goin' feel like you done find your way to Mars
The paper punctuated, yeah that's the new philosophy
A G I gotta be on top of that like an apostrophe
Fame must have got to me, confidants has got to be
I autograph myself, write a check & make it out to me
Beggers can't be choosers, go & get a ruler
Chain extra long like Will Chainalin's majulia
Other known as Koopa, ain't nobody cooler
Brain is a thing & she love to be my tutor
She loving my calone, huh, recognize the odor
Must of smell money, Ben Franklin's what I told her
Chris-talamatoda, Big swangers on my Roder
So they talkin' about my money in the city like promoters

[Verse 2: Z-Ro & (Chamillionaire)] I'm a thug so my criminal record ain't clean
(Your record ain't clean)
That's why I'm paranoid around police
(Lookin' out for the police)
I'm a superstar but I'm still street
(We know we gon' keep it street, street)
I got that gun under my seat, so don't agitate me, in the blink of an E.Y.E. you will become a memory
Damn, I would never have my gun on safety
Cause I been feelin' the strangest feelin' lately
(Chasin' money you know them haters hatin')
With 300 is cool but I won't say that
It ain't nothin' fragilite 'about me
5 deuce hoover C.R.I.P
(And can't no woman get no money out of me)
Unless it's Grandma Dorothy or auntie
I still representin' S.U.C
(And I'm a hold it down for Chamillitary)
When I meet up with 2Pac & Pimp C
And when I'm gone they gon' stare up at my cheese

[Verse 3: Paul Wall]
You do what I do then you would know what's in my bank account
And you would know why those that talk too much then we ain't hangin' out
Raspy runnin' the traps & I ain't hangin' around with Danger Mouse
Walkin' in the Forbes, could of swore I heard my name announced
They talkin' about no doe but wonderin' why I'm so rude to you
I only talk that dollar, talk that digit, talk that nume-rule
Chill with all that gossipin' this business as usual
Ben Franklin passed away & I was present at the funeral
He breaking in my house (dawg) I hope that what you ain't about
I keep a Mike Vick, so I hope you good at breakin' out
Breakin' in my vault (No) I hope this heater make you doubt
I got the right to think that I'm the best because I paid the cost
