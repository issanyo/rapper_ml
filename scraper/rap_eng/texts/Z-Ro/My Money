[Verse 1]
Seem like I run into my haters everywhere I go
And they got something to say
Long as they don't run up in my face
I ain't trippin'
I know they mad at me just cause of how often I make my dough
And that is everyday
So I be rollin' with my AK and a banana clip in
Yeah, like Derrick Lewis I'm a beast
Like Larry "Tae Kwon" Crowe I use my feet
I'll allow you because I lay down the law in these streets
No baking soda needed I am the raw (fuck 'em)
Z-Ro that hoe ass nigga ain't shit
That's a rental Bentley that hoe ass nigga ain't rich
I got a bottle of Macallan 40 I'm 'bout to pop it
Don't trade the Bentley coupe for the Continental just cop it

[Hook]
Y'all can keep on talkin' I'll keep stackin' out here
All I hear is my money
Yeah
My Money
Pistol in my britches for you bitches
Ya'll ain't takin' shit from me
'Bout my money

[Verse 2]
Certain people at the record label tried to block my shine
But I am the sun
Thirteen years later and I'm not done
That's why they trippin'
They'd rather see me homeless beggin' for nickels and dimes
But I ain't the one
This big ass house ain't in the slums
I'm out here gettin' it
They always got that bitter beer face
They ain't drankin' what I'm drankin' that's that bitter beer taste
They mad but they can kiss my ass
I shed blood, sweat and tears for this
And this wasn't overnight either I waited years for this
Amen, I'm thankin' God on my knees and my hands
You know I'd rather keep it holy though
Fuck over me you're on your way to meet the Holy Ghost
Stop actin' like you know me you don't really know me hoe
You just know I got that killer kush and want to puff some more
And when I say no you say "Z-Ro a hoe!"
I ain't trippin' on gas I get fifteen or more or so
I don't even need to see that much cause I am from a place where I ain't get to eat that much

[Hook]
Y'all can keep on talkin' I'll keep stackin' out here
All I hear is my money
Yeah
My Money
Pistol in my britches for you bitches
Ya'll ain't taking shit from me
'Bout my money
