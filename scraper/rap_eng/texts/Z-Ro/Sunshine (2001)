[Verse 1: Z-Ro]
No more letters to the president this one is to Jehovah
What was born into the world as a christian now becomes a soldier
I'm pimping the pen from living a sin so niggas like my songs
Chef Ro-D up in the kitchen so these cluckers like my stones
Mo-City Texas that's my home but i'm known to be a loner
There be no witness to this crime when i'm creeping the fuck up on ya
One by one with a cigarette maybe Newport shorts and a box of possibly Kools
Cause a nigga do anything to get paid they say i'm a god damn fool
I conversate with momma but she can't answer me back
I'm in the world one deep missing that lady cause that cancer did that
Got a nigga looking for a wife but most of these hoes be living in shife
Wait till a nigga get paid then get laid and try to take a niggas life
I just can't take no more my heart is broken it got to many cracks
See the woman i love don't need a pistol cause she be killing me with that
So look into my eyes and please tell me what you see
Will they open the pearly gates for me i wanna be free

[Chorus: Z-Ro]x2
I wonder if the sun shines on the other side
Cause i bet my momma ain't seen a rainy day since she died
And maybe being gone ain't all that bad
Its gotta be better then wasting time with a pen and a pad

[Verse 2: Z-Ro]
Living in poverty ain't a part of the plan
So i'm on the corner hustling with work in my hand
I know my momma wouldn't approve of my lifestyle
But i must get it the way i live and its right now
My nigga my credits fucked up so i can't put nothing in my name
Let alone i'm having hard time maintaining some change
I'm so familiar with anger smoking weed can't even stop the pain
I walk assured please god stop the rain
While i'm fiendin for heaven seems like hell is what i'm living for
My destiny is to die or forever walk the prison floor
How can i be man 24 with no home i'm puttin a piece to your dome and leavin it like the ozone
A cold cold world that we living in
Killers will take your life and it ain't gotta be about no dividends
Forgive me for my sins i'm just tryna make it
Tryna keep my pistol from my head cause i just can't take it

[Chorus: Z-Ro]x2
I wonder if the sun shines on the other side
Cause i bet my momma ain't seen a rainy day since she died
And maybe being gone ain't all that bad
Its gotta be better then wasting time with a pen and a pad

[Verse 3: Z-Ro]
I wonder if the lord is gonna show me some compassion or will i be victim to motherfuckers when they blasting
Having flashbacks of 94' with bullets to the back
Cause my homies left me lonely now my partner is my strap
Living everyday like its my last one
So i'm trippin keep my finger on the trigger every time i'm flippin
I don't wanna be another face on a t-shirt
So when motherfuckers bring the drama me and Nina burst
No i need to be in church but i'm trapped out on the block
Pumping rock after rock god please make it stop
I'm a victim of the struggle trying to make my life easy
But it ain't what I expected it's hectic it's sleezy
I'm on my knees daily asking god to stop the pain
Dealing with all this damn strain see my pistol see my brain
About to take my final stand I'm a man in his own mind
Steady hurting but I hope I heal in time

[Chorus: Z-Ro]x2
I wonder if the sun shines on the other side
Cause i bet my momma ain't seen a rainy day since she died
And maybe being gone ain't all that bad
Its gotta be better then wasting time with a pen and a pad
