[Z-Ro:]
Aight, aight, aight

[Z-Ro:]
When the Fetti be rollin' setty, won't nobody go home?
When the money start lookin' funny, all my friends get gone
Concerts & studio time, they love to come & kick it
But without gas money Z-Ro gon' miss it
I thought to myself, this feels like don't nobody hear me
Even though I screamin' I must be a demon 'cause won't nobody come near me
People laugh at me 'cause I ain't got respect like faith
Fuck respect, I do this to keep a ride & a place
Will I survive? 'Cause God's watchin'
Satan is takin' my sanity please God stop it
I'm feelin' like Snoop 'cause murder was the case that they gave me
They knew I ain't do it, but just to they permission they wanna hang me
I'm feelin' like Jesus when he was about to be crucified
Please everyone if you don't help me then you could die
Suicide is safety, but it's definite hell
Somebody dead & they got me stressin' in hell
I'm sangin' the blues

[Chorus: Z-Ro]
Everyday I'm still goin' through the Samethang
I'm tryin' so hard just to maintain
All I ever wanted was just to make a lil' change
I'm real but niggas still talk down on my name
Everyday I'm still goin' through the Samethang
I'm tryin' so hard just to maintain
All I ever wanted was to be in the rap game
'Cause my people step on me like I'm a flow mad fame

[Z-Ro:]
I'm used to mother organizations & 'loc's of my own
Evaporate like Brillo when fiends smokin' that stones
That's the way we live in the ghetto, if we could we'd change
But don't nobody love us but trouble, so that's why we bang
Many funerals to go to, I don't go to none
Never look in a pine box until I see Z-Ro in one
Ain't no future in front & I'm scared to be decease
But it seems like the only way a gorilla-mobb gangsta gon' see peace
'Cause mama waitin' for me, her & Grandma Bezzy
Tellin' me ain't no haters in Heaven or detectives to sweat me
But a mansion a home in the ground, that'll be mine
Hand ready singin' praises to God, that'll be fine
Plus they tell me the streets are made of gold
Here people murder people, the webbin' in Heaven is under your toes
It ain't hard doin' right, it's just hard to succeed
I wanna live but it's hard to breathe
It got me singin' the blues

[Chorus: Z-Ro]
Everyday I'm still goin' through the Samethang
I'm tryin' so hard just to maintain
All I ever wanted was just to make a lil' change
I'm real but niggas still talk down on my name
Everyday I'm still goin' through the Samethang
I'm tryin' so hard just to maintain
All I ever wanted was to be in the rap game
'Cause my people step on me like I'm a flow mad fame

[Z-Ro:]
I done came along way, but it's still alot of road up ahead
To be honest I be feelin' like I'm about to be dead
People feel as if I'm suppose be happy 'cause I'm makin' some ends
But I'm lonely 'cause I cannot communicate with my friends
Niggas I grew up with, be actin' like we ain't grow up together
Fuck hoes & pour up together
Nigga you cried on my shoulders & I cried on yours
Yeah you rode on my enemies, so I ride on yours
But it's a different day & time
And we don't even kick it
Ain't nobody got time to holla no more it's strictly business
But I tell you this, I will always have love for ya
The same nigga bitch I still shed blood for ya
The same nigga blood bitch I love ya
I went to school to fight niggas for you
Even though we wasn't Blood Brothers
Fuck that, we was brothers
What we is now?
I can't do nothin' but continue my years out
But it's all gravy, ain't nobody gotta chill with me
Only thing I ask nigga keep it real with me

[Chorus: Z-Ro]
Everyday I'm still goin' through the Samethang
I'm tryin' so hard just to maintain
All I ever wanted was just to make a lil' change
I'm real but niggas still talk down on my name
Everyday I'm still goin' through the Samethang
I'm tryin' so hard just to maintain
All I ever wanted was to be in the rap game
'Cause my people step on me like I'm a flow mad fame
