Mayne, you know it's a trip
Having these nothing ass niggas and these bullshit ass broads
Always got something to say about the next man and his household
Unable to get on top of they shit cause they so worried about everybody else's
What he got and, what he don't have and what they need to get
Man, if they emphasized they time on them
Maybe they'd be a better person theyself

"That's you" that talk about your homie behind his back
But you always with him every location he be at
"That's you" that be stealing from your momma
Knowing she be the only one at your side, helping you through your drama
"That's you" selling crack, but can't make no profit
Cause you smoking it up and you just can't seem to stop it
"That's you" that keep laying low without a rubber
Don't want to claim your baby you naked-headed lover, that's your baby's mother
"You" A woman that's so deceitful, smiling as you do evil
Making money to set up your own people
"That's you" throwing pussy at your homegirl's husband every evening
Then tryna convince her that he be cheating
"That's you" Hate a woman doing better than you are
So you slash her tires and bust all the windows out her car
"That's you" that can't get over your ex-man
Putting the problems of your previous relationship on the next man

[Hook: 2X]
You, ought to be ashamed of yourself
Just the, shell of a man playing games with yourself
That's you, making the real women look fake
Only hurting yourself with the decisions that you make

"That's you" that beat your kid
Cause somebody said he'd done something, but you don't even go see if he did
"That's you" still living in your parent's home
You got a good paying job but won't even pay for the phone
"That's you" with that unattractive attitude
People don't wanna be around you cause you be ruining their mood
"That's you" that's thinking that somebody owed you something
Ain't gon' be satisfied until somebody showed you something
"You" rolling your eyes and popping your neck
Cause you with a hot roller, but homie only want you for sex
"That's you" Think you the shit because your body is tight
What you gon' do if God decide to change that overnight?
"That's you" that can't stay in a woman's place
Hit a man, hoping he hits you back so you can take his freedom away
"That's you" that enjoy making people's lives hard
But when trouble come around your way, you gon' run into God

[Hook: 2X]

[Z-Ro]
"That's you" that get up every night to go out and jack
But you reap what you sow, so don't get mad when it come back
"That's you" that been out committing all that crime
Now you're suicidal cause you gotta do all that time
"That's you" spending all of your money on beer and blunts
And ain't got nothing on your bills come the first of the month
"That's you" that don't care about how stupid you act
Man I'm so glad I'm no longer living my life like that
"That's you" tryna fuck over people who work for ya
Even with all of that money, ain't no peace on earth for ya
"That's you" Yeah that's you that made your homeboys hate ya
You can't go nowhere without a gun cause you nervous by nature
"That's you" that's in and out of jail on the same charge
Get out and do the same thang on the same boulevard
"That's you" that's gon' end up in a funeral home
You bobbing your head but I know you can't stand this song, cause that's you
