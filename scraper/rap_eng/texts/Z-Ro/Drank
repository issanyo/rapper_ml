[Hook: Z-Ro]
Every time I stop drinkin', drank keeps callin' me back
I need to stop it but it taste so good
I love the way it make me feel but I spent too much money on that
I need to stop it, I need to stop it
Every time I stop drinkin', drank keeps callin' me back
I need to stop it but it taste so good
I love the way it make me feel but I spent too much money on that
I need to stop it, I need to stop it

[Verse 1: Z-Ro]
Four ounces of Promethazine, 20 ounce soda
Styrofoam make ice cubes last a lot longer
Your cup cool but my cup is a whole lot stronger
If the soda damn near black then I'm the motherfuckin' owner
To buy drank, well it used to cost an arm and a leg
But now it's outrageous they really want your arm and your leg
Shit, I drunk a 4 door Porsche back in 2008
And if the drank man was sleep I'd hang round and wait
I wake up sippin' like a motherfucker, ichin' like a motherfucker
Attitude for no reason, I'm trippin' like a motherfucker
I need the drank man to show me some love
Before I fuck around get somebody to show me your plug, bitch

[Hook: Z-Ro]
Every time I stop drinkin', drank keeps callin' me back
I need to stop it but it taste so good
I love the way it make me feel but I spent too much money on that
I need to stop it, I need to stop it
Every time I stop drinkin', drank keeps callin' me back
I need to stop it but it taste so good
I love the way it make me feel but I spent too much money on that
I need to stop it, I need to stop it

[Verse 2: Slim Thug]
I wondered last year how many sweets I rolled
I wondered last year how many cups I poured
Of that muddy, muddy, purple
I purchase by the pint
I spent too much motherfuckin' money on this drank
The prices so high, got a nigga bunk sippin'
At least that's how it start until I tell myself I'm trippin'
Then it's fours poured until everything slowed
It make me feel good, I can't say no
But it's breakin' my bankroll
That plus the dro? I coulda bought a new Rose
Or paint the mansion house snow
All of what I drink and smoke, I feelin' like I'm a fiend
Cause everyday all day, I gotta be on lean


[Hook: Z-Ro]
Every time I stop drinkin', drank keeps callin' me back
I need to stop it but it taste so good
I love the way it make me feel but I spent too much money on that
I need to stop it, I need to stop it
Every time I stop drinkin', drank keeps callin' me back
I need to stop it but it taste so good
I love the way it make me feel but I spent too much money on that
I need to stop it, I need to stop it

[Verse 3: Paul Wall]
I'm the drink man favorite, let me place an order
I drink (?) like an athlete drinks water
I sip at least four a day since 2004
And when I try to stop, it only last a week or so
Playin' games, yeah I know
Thinkin' bout Big Moe
DJ Screw, Pimp C, and that Big Meek so
All of 'em died with Codeine in their blood
I'm in denial though, I never blame it on the mud
Infatuation know it's love
Thinkin' bout the way it was
Shoutout to my partner fuzz
We downed over 300 jugs
In one summer, 2007
I pray they got Actavis in Heaven

[Outro]
Real talk, in the corner store with some good ass kush. Barre in soda, that'd be straight. Tell Pimp C, tell Pimp C to save me a four of that Act' man. It's a red flash, two cups of ice. I'll be there soon, but not too soon, but I'll be there soon bruh. You know what I'm sayin', rest in peace
