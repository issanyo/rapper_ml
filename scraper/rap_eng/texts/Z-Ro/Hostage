Girl you need to don't let it go
I'm talking bout that pussy bad
The only thing I need to call the laws on
Is you laying in my bed with them motherfucking drawers on
Girl you need to don't let it go
That pussy bad
On the blue diamond in the bedroom
I can't shake it off
I don't give a damn about boy shorts
Bitch take 'em off

[Verse 1]
It ain't no Netflix and chill up in here
Just you face down, ass up, I'm at the rear
Not going in the [?] shoot I got to make that clear
My bad, here's a tie, wipe my children off your ear
Now pull them panties off and pull them panties to the side
It's cold out here I know it's warmer up inside
I feel like Kendrick Lamar woman please don't kill my vibe
This ain't Popeye's ain't looking for no breasts or no thighs
How you gon' put your mouth on me and then try to go to bed
I'm like girl I wish you would don't let me bust you in your head
I'm gon' make you cum a river till your bedspread is dead
You can't watch that, you gotta buy another one do it one more time
You gotta buy another one I go fed
I got rubbers and I got lube and I got six hours to spare
Fuck you trippin I already told you I'm gon' buy you some more hair
Stop acting like you don't want it why you texting make bitches dead
And I got other hoes to hit the tank bitch I'm in the wind

[Verse 2]
I know what you heard but I promise I'm gon' take it easy
I'm going all the way in I'm just trying to make it greasy
You told me to please you well it's only right you please me
This dick is for you I believe in giving to the needy
This ain't the fifteen minutes that you're used to
If you don't be careful your panties gonna be full soon
And you can't ride in here with that baby this ain't no voodoo
You already know the king of the ghetto is riding school blue
Smoking pot, hoeing up right after your pot turned up
If I weren't rapping I do pornography that's how I blow up
And it ain't even gotta be on a Tuesday when I go up
With VIP in the DJ booth in the middle of the floor I don't give no fuck
Used to kill now killer is damaged the uterus woman is smoked up
My dick is whipping it's murder murder when it come out the whole stuff
Moving in like a tampon go so hard guess she gon' be creeping when I'm through with her
Not Tyrone but I'm gon' fuck the bitch [?] bitch ain't nothing to do with her

[Bridge]
Take them blue jeans off and give it up
Take the jogging pants off and give it up
Take your biking tights off and give it up
Pull your mini skirts up and give it up
Take that lingerie off and give it up
Take them boy shorts off and give it up
Take the g string off and give it up
Unless you got on grandma panties what the fuck
Whoo!
