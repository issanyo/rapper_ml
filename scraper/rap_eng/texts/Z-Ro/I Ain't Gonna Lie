[Chorus]
Telling it like it is, I ain't gonna lie
I know, I know, I know
They think I'm crazy baby
Telling it like it is, I ain't gonna lie
I know, I know, I know
They think I'm crazy

[Verse 1]
I'm on one, fuck it, I'm on two
Give a fuck what these pussy niggas say they gonna do
Yeah you bad than a motherfucker until I walk up on you
Stop acting like I turned my back on ya, love is all I've shown you
All these managers say they had the perfect plan for my career
But when I stopped fucking with them, I was still right here
Yeah I know this where I'm from, but it don't feel right here
Everybody hate me I just might get myself killed right here
Money and work at the bottom of the pool, that's why you always see me swim
But it's really for my bitches, I'm a motherfucking pimp
After my first breath, I promise I ain't trusted a motherfucker since
When I'm up, I can't get rid of y'all, when I'm down, where y'all motherfuckers went
Fuck all y'all

[Chorus]
Telling it like it is, I ain't gonna lie
I know, I know, I know
They think I'm crazy baby
Telling it like it is, I ain't gonna lie
I know, I know, I know
They think I'm crazy

[Verse 2]
Having babies is the new hustle, for nothing ass hoes
Momma name brand, but the baby in some nothing ass clothes
Wish it was legal to keep on kicking you across your nothing ass nose
Never trust a bitch... I bet ya now my nothing ass knows
Keep doing your thing King [?]
Don't never change be the same everyday just like a real ass rerun
And tax season, I ain't waiting on no refund
When I'm looking in the mirror, salute a real nigga when I see one
These niggas ain't listening
I guess thats what I get for letting my niggas handle my business then
I wonder if these real niggas really know what that means
Blowing the game on purpose means you really play for that team (Traitor)
Big homies, it ain't nothing but respect
But I'm a grown man with children, so I ain't bowing down to shit. I mean
Unless you god my nigga, move the moon or move the sun and I'll bow down right now
And I ain't supposed to eat, I'm supposed to chow down right now
Keep faith in god even though the devil trying to clown right now
Hallelujah though, so, can I get a witness in here
What was done in the dark is never seen so it ain't no witnesses here
Z-Ro the Mo-City Don and I'm just...

[Chorus]
Telling it like it is, I ain't gonna lie
I know, I know, I know
They think I'm crazy baby
Telling it like it is, I ain't gonna lie
I know, I know, I know
They think I'm crazy
