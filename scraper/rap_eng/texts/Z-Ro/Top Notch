[Hook: Pimp C Sample]
Top notch hoes get the most, not the lesser
Top notch hoes get the most, not the lesser
Top notch hoes get the most, not the lesser
Trash like to fuck for forty dollars in the club
Top notch hoes get the most, not the lesser
Top-Top notch hoes get the most, not the lesser
Top-Top notch hoes get the most, not the lesser
Trash like to fuck for forty dollars in the club

[Verse 1]
I stay in Pimp Mode, got fifty zip codes like Pimpin' Ken
In a 300, in a Biarritz, Bentley or a Benz
You been eating your chicken dinner, its time for you to win
I got room for one more horse in my stable you should come in
Trash like to fuck for forty dollars in the club
And the nigga standing diamond now, yeah you can't fuck with us
Working with what I been through is about, did you know what it was
Time to get high off dollar signs, we don't need no drugs
Top notch hoes get the most not the lesser
You think you pimping, you gon' end up on a stretcher
King of the Ghetto Entertainment, Rap-A-Lot, MTM Records
We did good on our own, but it's more money if were together

[Verse 2]
My mama used to tell me about these, renegade ass bitches in these streets
You need direction baby, I'll provide protection baby
If it's just you and me, no need to start undressing baby
Cause I don't want your body, I want what your body bring
I never been a gigolo baby I'm about that change
Catch me in a candy blue thing when I'm in the turning lane
I don't fuck with "reggie miller", its designer douja burning mane
My residence Texas, Mo City my block
I can pass in every section, I can kick it in any spot
I'm rolling behind tint and if the coppers harass
Man just tell them I'm running with J-Rich and put your foot back on the gas

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Sunday morning I'm pulling out my bitch I'm looking good
Nothing but diamonds around my neck
And around my wrists I'm looking good (looking good, what it is, what it is)
Double-breasted tailor made, I'm Versace down to the floor
And it don't matter if you step on my Wing-Tip shoes cause
Im'a just go buy me some more (what it is, what it is)
Look homey, I'm feeling larger than life
Just because I'm able to provide for my daughter tonight
I went to sleep on the bench but I woke up on a king size
Now every day of my life I see so many green guys
