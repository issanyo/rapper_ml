[Intro]
Zromocitydon is my official twitter
Not Zrofficial not OfficialZro or any other of that bull havin ass shit ya dig, now lets go nigga

[Hook]
Ya dig what Im sayin mane
Cause uh, I never had love for a bitch
Im about my money
I never had love for a bitch
Im about my money
I never had love for a bitch
Lets go

[Verse 1]
Usually I dont laugh n joke, see but lately I been jokin n laughin
To try n keep myself from blastin
Ima professional when it come to keepin my cool
But lately I been itchin to act a god damn fool
Ready to slide a clip in the choppa n straight up go retarded
Homie all I really know Im stupid please dont get me started
Im tired of catchin cases, bun money, and attorneys
But I’ll do life sentence before I let somebody burn me
N if it ain't my friends its my kinfolk
That’ll make me slide em up under sumthin even murk em when the Mac 10 smoke
I dont wanna be the reason people ain't breathin
So when the crowd start gatherin thats when Ima be leavin
Whenever u see me I be alone
Cause if ain't nobody wit me who can say they saw me do sumthin wrong?
Friends turn into flies like caterpillars turn into butterflies
Im solid but I can't say the same about them other guys

[Chorus]
My people ain't gettin down no mo’ 
That ain't the way it post to be but thats the way its gon go
Im showin u love but I love myself even mo’ 
So if its either u or zro u know u got to go
Trust no man or nigga, no female or hoe
I used to have friends but I dont want friends no mo’ 
They jus come around to kick it while Im rollin in dough
So if u ain't my lord n savior u gotta be my foe

[Verse 2]
I gotta die one day n thats one thing I understand
Hopefully while Im sleepin n not at the hands of a man
Cause the same homie that keep sayin he down for life
Might be money hungry itchin to blow me down on sight
Theres 10 rules to survival, but I’ll share wit u 6
Know most people ain't gettin (?), they ain't even close to bein rich
Rule 1 ain't even complicated, make sure this is done
Homie never leave the pad witout packin a gun
2, stick to what u know new faces might be the feds
Keep yo family safe, 3 dont hustle where u lay yo head
Rule 4, never let yo left hand know what yo right hand did
The closest way to go broke or to do a bid
N the jackas ain't jus after ya cheese
Rule 5, never ever underestimate the next mans greed
Rule 6, trust nobody not even who u sleep wit
They’ll tell yo secrets now yo enemies know yo weakness

[Chorus]
My people ain't gettin down no mo’ 
That ain't the way it post to be but thats the way its gon go
Im showin u love but I love myself even mo’ 
So if its either u or zro u know u got to go
Trust no man or nigga, no female or hoe
I used to love friends but I dont love friends no mo’ 
They jus come around to kick it while Im rollin in dough
So if u ain't my lord n savior u gotta be my foe

[Verse 3]
Hold up Im Tookie Williams, Im Larry David
This ain't no pistol, chop yo house down witout even aimin
Swear to god it wasn't me I was entertainin
45 hunnit muthafuckas locin n flamin
These street niggas respect me cause I speak they language
Rap niggas be MIA, Im in the hood hangin
Not mystical but here I go ain't got time to hide
All these sets of swangas I got damn right Im gon ride
(?) my ass is on the gator
I feel so good I drove to Georgia now Im in Decator
My price gon stay the same these niggas prices elevators
Serve niggas anything they wanna buy cause Ima waiter
Waitin on niggas to send the bread its all about the paper
24s yellow n purple but it ain't a laker
Thats jus what we drank n hit my cup n taste the paper
Ima number 2 pencil I’ll buy my head n erase a hater
Got eyes on my (?) dawg all they do is chase the paper
I dont owe money cause when its time to pay they misplace the paper
Hold up, fuck yall bitch niggas
