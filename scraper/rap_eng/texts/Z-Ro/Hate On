It's Z-Ro
The Mo City Don
With a special dedication
To all my haters
And all y'all haters
Let's keep makin em mad

Yeah you hate me every time I turn around
And every time I'm up you always try to bring me down
I'm way up in the sky, why you want me on the ground?
When bosses hang with bosses guess that's why you ain't around, hater
Don't ever call my phone, leave me the hell alone if it ain't about paper
So many lobsters and so many steaks, ain't no more Now and Later's
Only candy I got is the paint on my car
I got God on my side and that's all I'ma need I'm ready to take haters to war
Run up on me then
If they say I act funny since I'm makin money they really don't know me then
Let the Truth Be Told, my nigga, I've been actin funny since way back when
The fuck is a friend?
Everybody I see is pretend
They say they my people but they ain't my people I know they would rather see Ro in the pen, man

I ain't even much trippin on they JTE
I'm too B-L-E-double S-E-D
Hate on, hate on, hate on, hate on
Hate on, hate on, hate on, hate on
They be kidnappin my sun but I'm still gon shine
But I be still gettin money that's why I don't mind
Hate on, hate on

Hate me definitely or hate me maybe
You can hate me night or you hate me daily
Screwed up since 1997
Ever since then they still pay me, baby
I run this city like decathlon
To the motherfuckin money is the path I'm on
Who me, my nigga? I'm just a G, my nigga
God and geometry is the math I'm on
Dislike it, but who the fuck cares?
I'm worried bout mine, I ain't worried bout theirs
Bitch nigga say I sold my soul
They say I snort cocaine when I blow my nose
These rappers wear high heels and open toes
Yet they talk about me
Down south rap wouldn't be nothin without me
I'm a landmark like Sam Houston
Not Trae Tha Truth but I am Houston
I am Dallas, I am Austin, I'm San Antonio too
I'm Midland/Odessa, I'm Padre Island, the whole state of Texas and all the South too
Got a couple homies and a lot of haters
Used to be broke, now I got a lot of paper
Yea the bitch so fine, might lose my mind
But won't spend one dime, I ain't trying to save her
They was laughing at me back in '96
2015, they be trying to ride me, shit
But I remember too good back when I was in the hood
They was hatin on a nigga, how could I forget?
Just raise the fuck up off a player's penis
Just came from Pluto fuckin with Future, now I'm on Venus
Hate on

I ain't even much trippin on they JTE
I'm too B-L-E-double S-E-D
Hate on, hate on, hate on, hate on
Hate on, hate on, hate on, hate on
They be kidnappin my sun but I'm still gon shine
But I be still gettin money that's why I don't mind
Hate on, hate on

You know I got to salute all my haters
Your [] got to be so strong
Cuz when you're talkin down on me
You still gotta look up at me
Hold up
Vandross
Chuuch!
