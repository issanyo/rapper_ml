[Hook]
When you already past I don't give a fuck
And you feel like you're close to giving up
You're bout to do it ain't ya
Satan bout to get ya
But God say if he with ya
He's more than the world against ya then ya said
You ain't gotta worry baby it's alright
You ain't gotta worry homie it's alright
I know you think it's over for ya it's alright
The pain don't last forever baby it's alright

Just look at what He did for me
I had to want it though
Problem was I wanted it too fast
I didn't want it slow
It feels great to be alive huh
Don't it though
Cuz I could've ended up
Where the rest of my homies go
Don't do it Ro (suicide)
I was like fuck that
On my way to hell I thought about it
Was like fuck that
God is good, God is grace
I thank Him for my food
I thought I was walking
He carried me no dirt on my shoes
Satan hating on your happiness
But let him hate
Just tell him I'm God's child
I bet that's gon set him straight
No weapon formed against thee shall prosper
But weapons gon form
Look like you making it anyway
He been blessing your storm

[Hook]

After you done made a dollar out of 10 cents
Why it still feel like you got 10 cents?
This ain't living like a king
Not this shit
Praying so hard
Your knees ain't never been this bent
All you need is just a little love that'll do
Give it to God
I promise that's what I had to do
I ain't perfect
I had to check how I was acting too
Sometimes it be the shit you be doing
Coming after you
I know shit ain't been going right
And you're fed up
But you can't see your blessings
If you ain't got your head up
It ain't here when you want it
But it's right on time huh
You was that close
To losing your mind huh
Thank the Lord

[Chorus]
