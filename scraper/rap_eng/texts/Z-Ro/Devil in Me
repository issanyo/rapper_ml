[Chorus - Z-Ro & Ronnie Spencer:]
If I would've signed that contract, I'd be richer than rich
But when they say that I'd have to die face down in that ditch
Everybody wanna try to bring out the devil in me
What keeps my soul at ease, is G-O-D
If I attended that ceremony I'd be better off
Find myself a celebrity, but I'd be forever lost
Everybody wanna try to bring out the devil in me
What keeps my soul at ease, is G-O-D

[Verse 1- Z-Ro :]
What good is it for me to gain the world but yet lose my soul
I would have been a millionaire since 20 years old
I wouldn't have had to pay for all of these diamonds and gold
Just sacrifice one of my people I ain't really know
They say hell is a party that's right under the floor
And even if I live righteous, that's where I gotta go
Sign this contract, and my savior won't know me no more
But while I'm living I'm a king and I'm rolling in dough
Blood in, blood out, that's the rule
Royal penis is clean, I don't even tie my shoe
I wouldn't even get to see none of my hoover blues
No more Mo City for me, I'd be kicking it with the Jews
It would feel like I'm winning, but in the end I would lose
Keep rolling with G-O-D, my salvation is what I choose
And even though they don't know me everywhere they should
I'm blessed and I'm satisfied I made it out of my hood

[Chorus - Z-Ro & Ronnie Spencer:]
If I would've signed that contract, I'd be richer than rich
But when they say that I'd have to die face down in that ditch
Everybody wanna try to bring out the devil in me
What keeps my soul at ease, is G-O-D
If I attended that ceremony I'd be better off
Find myself a celebrity, but I'd be forever lost
Everybody wanna try to bring out the devil in me
What keeps my soul at ease, is G-O-D

[Verse 2 - Z-Ro:]
Grandma Dorothy would probably turn over in her grave
If she thought I did something that would keep me from being saved
She said "Grandson, the lord going to be with you all of your days
Long as you don't start tripping and stop giving him his praise"
But I wanna live in a mansion and travel in private planes
I'd be rich messing with Satan, with God I got pocket change
Would've been rich a long time ago, doing all type of big things
Probably would've died a long time ago too, being thankful is what I'm gonna do
Never was easy, was always hard; I'm thankful for what I go through
You know me but if you don't know God I can't say I know you
I need to work on my temper, Lord, I be going off
It been 20 years, I'm still in this game; like I know I lost
They don't mess with me like they mess with Jeezy, Luda, and Ross
But its all good though, I keep doing my thing; I am a boss
Even though they don't know me everywhere they should
I'm blessed and I'm satisfied I made it out of my hood

[Chorus - Z-Ro & Ronnie Spencer:]
If I would've signed that contract, I'd be richer than rich
But when they say that I'd have to die face down in that ditch
Everybody wanna try to bring out the devil in me
What keeps my soul at ease, is G-O-D
If I attended that ceremony I'd be better off
Find myself a celebrity, but I'd be forever lost
Everybody wanna try to bring out the devil in me
What keeps my soul at ease, is G-O-D

[Verse 3 - Ronnie Spencer:]
But I ain't everybody, I just wanna be me
Making my own destiny in this industry
Hella ways just to get paid, and all good money
All I'd rather the fortune and fame, the way God planned for me
