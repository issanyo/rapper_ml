[Hook]
Yall don’t get that money like we are
Smoke good and get lunches like we are

Get worse or get better like we are
Keep it real forever like we are
Don’t get they girls wetter like we are
That’s just how that shit goes

[Verse 1]
Listen
1996 when I started this shit and I’m still here
Started off with nothing and turned it into something a lot hundred dolla bills here
Very few rich niggas whole lotta bitch niggas that’s just how it is here
Not just from this city I run this city look at everything I did here
January 19 Josepgh Wayne Mcvey day a real nigga holiday
Where real niggas show love the real niggas get all the unreal niggas out the way
Look if you a hater and you always hating man fuck you and that’s all I gotta say
And if you see me with a bad bitch I didn’t have to spend shit I be damn if Ima pay
One time for my people trying to find a better way
Trying to put food on the table running from the popo everyday
Chasing opportunity like bitch you ain’t gone get away
Either you gone get better or you gone get gone I ain't hearing that shit today

[Hook]
Yall go get that money like we are
Smoke good and get lunches like we are
Yall don’t be cross country like we are
That’s just how that shit goes
Get worse or get better like we are
Keep it real forever like we are
Don’t get their girls wetter like we are
That’s just how that shit goes

[Verse 2]
Thanksgiving we gone pass out turkeys
And for Christmas we pass out gifts
If somebody try to play with my money call my hitman let em pass out hits
And we always serios even if you tell a funny joke we don’t laugh bout shit
Let me find out you been raping our women when we see you you gone get your ass stumped out quick
We ain’t smokin on none of that reggie baby we smoking loud
Soon as I inhale I’m already fucked up as soon as I blow it out
I got everything I need at the house already so Im not going out
Stripper poles and strippers a bartender at the bar
And my war room ready I’m ready to go to war
Try to run up you gona get in the head
No mannequin challenge you really dead
Real street nigga, but a real CEO too I’m in the black I ain't never in the red
I’m always working always on my feet if I ain’t getting head I ain't in the bed
Looking at you lazy ass niggas like shaking my head you ain’t even gotta wonder what I said

[Hook]
Yall go get that money like we are
Smoke good and get lunches like we are
Yall don’t be cross country like we are
That’s just how that shit goes
Get worse or get better like we are
Keep it real forever like we are
Don’t get their girls wetter like we are
That’s just how that shit goes
