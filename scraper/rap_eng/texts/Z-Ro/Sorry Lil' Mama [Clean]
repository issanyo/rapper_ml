Sorry, lil' mama, I gotta go
Not tryna' hit and run ya but I got another show
It's already check out time plus my plane leaves at four
Give me them digits and a later date
I'll f*** with you some more
Meanwhile rollin' on chrome
Every lil' mama I run into wanna take me home
Tryna' give 'em all a fair share because they all want this bone
So don't get mad at me if my cellphone is on roam
I'm just tryna' get some dome
Yeah, now if you rollin' with me come now
I'm a gangsta I'll never put my g*** down
I can't drive, girl, 'cause I'm h***
I see ya belly ring plus you got a butterfly
Twenty eights when I roll out
Ten clear coats on my gold drop
What's yo name? Where you from, girl?
I got a Presidential Suite, you can come, girl
I got Cris by the case load
What the hell, ya ,baby, daddy in my face for?
Now I'm reachin' for my waist s***
We got chicks in every state, woah
Sorry, lil' mama, I gotta go
Not tryna' hit and run ya but I got another show
It's already check out time plus my plane leaves at four
Give me them digits and a later date
I'll f*** with you some more
Meanwhile rollin' on chrome

So don't get mad at me if my cellphone is on roam
I'm just tryna' get some dome
Huh, the whip paid fo', she starin' at my watch
I'm like, â€½What you in my face for?â€
Oh, she heard of rider gang, she wanna ride a gangsta
Ride with a gangsta, I'm a type of gangsta
It ain't 'bout the fame, she just diggin' my nature
It ain't 'bout the change, she said, â€½I want the paperâ€
I'm feelin' ya style and ya classy ways
I want my child in ya stomach but not havin' my baby
Anyway I'm a one night stand man
And after this night I'm a dump you like a trash can
Like I set you on fire I can put you out
I was ya gas can and I can be ya water spout
Sorry, lil' mama, I gotta go
Not tryna' hit and run ya but I got another show
It's already check out time plus my plane leaves at four

Tryna' give 'em all a fair share because they all want this bone
So don't get mad at me if my cellphone is on roam
I'm just tryna' get some dome
Yeah, I gotta Sprint and a T Mobile and a Nextel phone
And all three of 'em ringin' from bad a*** b*** that wanna bone
Take one or two calls, take one to the telly and take one home
Cuttin' corners barely missin' the curb, tryin' not to break her bone
I'm sittin' on choppa eighty-threes and fresh a*** meat
A n*** tried to jack me for 'em so I opened up his chest last week
I'm rude as a m*** but I get nice when I receive h***
Might fall off for a minute but I get back right when I receive bread
Talk up on somethin' short and thick, go straight to the bed with it
But on the low, low 'cause someones always watchin' like a Fed visit
Crucify the c*** then cut a couple of corners
Cruisin' with me in the Bentley soon as I borrow ya
Sorry, lil' mama, I gotta go
Not tryna' hit and run ya but I got another show
It's already check out time plus my plane leaves at four

Now if you're rollin' with me come now
Now if you're rollin' with me come now
