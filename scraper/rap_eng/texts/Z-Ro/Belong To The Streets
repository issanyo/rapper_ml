[Verse 1:]
Look, I got my money right now
No more month to month
I can buy this shit right now
Shining so bright I don't need to buy no more ice now
They say no more A.B.N. for 'Ro, he is so polite now
I know my haters wanna see me down
I'm doing rich nigga shit everytime they see me now
Didn't believe me at first, I bet they believe me now
She used to see me everyday, It ain't that easy now
Cause I'm always on my grind
Not the average nigga, I won't be home by nine
Anytime you wanna see me, baby
All you gotta do is turn on the TV, baby
You ain't gotta keep blowing up my phone all day
I'ma handle my business, then I'm on my way
Right after I put you to sleep I'm right back out the door
I'm trying to turn 2 into 4 and then 4 into more

[Chorus:]
My heart belongs to the street, belongs to the street
But my love belongs to you, belongs to you
If I don't work, then I don't eat, then I don't eat
When I reach my quota, I'll fuck with you, with you

[Verse 2:]
I be all across the country chasing money everywhere
You ain't talking about no money then how could I ever care
Always at my hustle, these fellas are never there
And instead of looking over my shoulder I said a prayer, god bless
And Lord knows everybody had Air Jordans, I couldn't afford those
They used to talk about me cause I wore them poor clothes
So it ain't no love for niggas or for hoes
First of the month keep coming back just like a boomerang
And I keep on living like this, I gotta do the same "Hell yeah"
So I got shit to do, shit to do
But I can't wait to give this dick to you
I got to meet a couple people on my way home
Seem like we never get to kick it cause I stay gone
But when I look at how we living, I'm not tripping
So glad to see you I'm gon fuck you right here in the kitchen

[Chorus:]
My heart belongs to the street, belongs to the street
But my love belongs to you, belongs to you
If I don't work, then I don't eat, then I don't eat
When I reach my quota, I'll fuck with you, with you
