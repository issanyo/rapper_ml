[Verse 1]
Miss me with that bull shit
You know real niggas do real thangs
I said miss me with that bullshiiit
And put some respect on my name
Talkin down, but I don't mind cause I'd me dammed if I dont shine
I thought it was love (thought it was love)
You drank my drank and smoked my smoke
But would you be here if a nigga was broke?
That's why I dont give a fuck, I dont give a fuck
That's why I be like

[Hook]
Bye bye I don't need u in my life
Bye bye it shoulda never been hello
Bye bye I don't need you in my life
Bye bye, can we talk about it hell no

[Verse 2]
Ruth Chris on the weekdays and true loves on the weekends
99 problems but a friend ain't one homie you ain't gotta speak when you see him
She neve wanted to hear what he say, now she be all up in his dm's
Now all of yall can kiss his ass with ya tongues hangin out that's the attitude and the mood that I be in
Wood flows everywhere if its traffic the hellicopter gon get us there on time
One deep clothing ill foreva wear if it ain't boss life or? you know i gotta put on mine
Slim Thug that's my lil big brother these people all was schiming on what they can get from us
Ain't payin no nigga ain't paying no bitch
I don't even pay attention how im post to pay the rent?

[Hook]
Bye bye I don't need u in my life
Bye bye it shoulda never been hello
Bye bye I don't need you in my life
Bye bye, can we talk about it hell no
