[Intro]
Grab me some chips or something, man

[Verse 1: K-Rino & Z-Ro]
I'm living paycheck to paycheck, tryna pay the rent
Crackers thinking I'm a slave forever, they got me bent
I'm bout to pull a move, 'bout to rob one of 'em blind
Let me call my partner Z-Ro and see what's on his mind
Well, I'm going through a thang, K, I really need to make some change, K
I'm thinkin' 2-11, I'm feelin' strange, K
No job, there's no way for me to pay the bills
If you with me then let's get paid, live lavish and chill
You ain't sayin' nothing homie, I been waitin' for a lick
Got a gal fine as hell, but I'm too broke to trick
The last two months I've been thinking of a caper
Come scoop your boy up and let's connive on some paper
Get in, put on your seatbelt so the Laws won't hate
We takin' a trip to the bottoms with Mr. Hector bakes cakes
$9,000 for a half, $18,000 for a whole
But I ain't bring no money with me, just my black .44

[Hook x3: Z-Ro & K-Rino]
The game goes on
And it might not ever change
Too familiar with this pain
Is it suicide living in the fast lane?

[Verse 2: K-Rino & Z-Ro]
Boy, this plan kind of real, Ro, I'm ready to ride
But what's the deal with all these hard heads standing outside?
This boy he got an army and they all heat packers
Two guns against twenty equals two dead jackers
I know the odds are against us, therefore I planned ahead
In the trunk is an AK, HK, AR, in the back of the car
Plus, it ain't no rush, we gon' lay low
'Til his partners start to leaving and he's drunk on the floor
Yo, you know I heard that he a sucker for a screwing
Let's set this fool up with Michelle and let her do him
Get his guard down then right before he rise
We kick the door in and unleash heat, surprise
But it ain't his birthday, it's gon' be his worst day
K-Rino and Z-Ro, we both currency thirsty
Hit my phone, call Michelle so we can get it together
Man, I'm tired of being broke bro, let's get this cheddar

[Hookx3: Z-Ro & K-Rino]
The game goes on
And it might not ever change
Too familiar with this pain
Is it suicide living in the fast lane?

[Verse 3: K-Rino & Z-Ro]
You know what, Z-Ro, this move that we pulled was sheist
But I ain't never seen this kind of paper in my whole life
Money all around me, can't get much greater
Just stuff it in the bag, man, we'll count it up later
Yes, indeedy, guess you can say the needy got greedy
But I was tired of hearing my children scream, "Daddy, please feed me!"
I got up, got out and got something fast
But I'm feeling funny 'bout the way we got this cash
Man, don't sweat that, you 'bout to have the finer things
'Cause we got more money than Timmy Chan got wings
Diamond rings and fancy things and pockets full of change
'Cause the game goes on and it ain't gon' never change

[Hook x3: Z-Ro & K-Rino]
The game goes on
And it might not ever change
Too familiar with this pain
Is it suicide living in the fast lane?
