(It's ok) Seems like a hater always got some to say
(It's all good) They bumping we counting this money every day
(It's ok) Big heading on the way
(Wish you would) In a fawn when you see us riding away
(It's ok) Yeah. Filling up another safe
(Feeling good) We losing I love it man

[Verse 1 - Just Brittany:]
Pull up
Ain't even hopped out before a nigga hate
Damn
True enough, haters always got some to say
I don't pay attention to the lames
I swear they ain't never gonna change
I'm just gone do my thang
Mama always taught me keep it playa in the game
RIP Fat Pat. Yeah I love it man
Ten toes deep yeah a playa up in the game
You don't know me. You see in my pictures
You judge me by the old me, just know that she's different
They always try to hate me, but they will never break me
Seymour always taught me never let a nigga play me
I drink a bottle of stress and then I gargle the pain
Niggas don't get no ass and try to slaughter your name

[Verse 2 - Z-Ro:]
That's right
Woman ass niggas don't want no trouble
Yeah, yeah
Nigga fuck your team, you and your whole huddle. Yeah
I'm rolling with God
So why the hell would you think I give a fuck what you think?
I with blows and I'm throwing them hard
Eleven hundred dollars a day and I'm just talking 'bout what I drank
I was trying to build up a team that I could win with
But most niggas ain't loyal to begin with
I pay the TAB. Ain't nobody have to spend shit
(What?) Down to my last million. It's time to end this
Cause these niggas ain't playing fair
Shoot you in the back of the head and you laying there
But I'm top of my game. I plan on staying there
Going in like I'm on punishment. Ain't no playing there
