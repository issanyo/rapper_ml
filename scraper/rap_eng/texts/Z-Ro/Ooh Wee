[Z-Ro]
Lord, have mercy, mercy
Lord have mercy, mercy

[Chorus: Z-Ro]
Ooh wee, dear lord I don't want that to be me
Another black boy in the penitentiary
So many fall victim to these evil streets
And it just makes me say ooh wee

[Lil' O]
Even though life is hard
I walk through the thunderstorm knowing there's a god
And when trouble comes he'll be my shield and my sword strike down my foes
But I feel sorry for the ones that don't have god and don't know
Inhale the weed through my mouth, exhale out my nose
I've seen many niggas fell chasing money and clothes
Look in the game, cause the block feeds us
Chasing blood money, that's why we block bleeders
We grew up hating the police cause the cops beat us
And now we grown full of hate and we got heaters
And what a wicked combination, cause now a nigga out of control
And we ain't trying to hear shit, about we on the wrong road
We always got to catch a case, and the jail cell close
For a nigga just like us, got to fill us with holes
And ain't it cold, cause we suppose to stick to the trend
Even though the trend is dying or ending up in the penn but

[Chorus]
Ooh wee, dear lord I don't want that to be me
Another black boy in the penitentiary
So many fall victim to these evil streets
And it just makes me say
Ooh wee dear lord I don't want that to be me
Another black boy in the ground six feet deep
So many fall victim to these evil streets
And it just makes me say ooh wee

[Lil' O]
You tell me how you take the pain out
When you hear your partner just blew his brians out
You see the pressure of these streets it make you crazy
And everybody say they love you huh, but everybody shady
And all the youngsters got babies with mouths to feed
But all the youngsters dropped out they ain't got no degree
Cause these youngsters chasing cars and material things
But all the youngsters ain't thinking about the pain it could bring
I lost soul on the block, I will walk the streets
Going so hard on my grind, I forgot to eat
I can't forget the day my partner got knocked off his feet
By a dopefiend with a gauge trying to rob him for cheese
I saw the fear in his eyes, he knew he'd been shot and his leg was paralyzed
They had to amputate his legs that's when I realized how raw could be
And living life in these streets cause it wasn't for me, cause

[Chorus]

[Lil' O]
Dear father up in heaven have mercy on us
Protect us from these evil streets that be murdering us
Protect us from these crooked cops that put burden on us
Protect us from these heartless D.A's that put hurting on us
Protect us from ourselves, some of us don't know no better
Thinking that a life of crime the only way to get cheddar
Protet us from our jealousy and our lust for power
Knowing the devil walk the street seeking room to devour
I ain't really got no friends
Cause all my real dogs are in the grave or in the pen
They left when they was boys, I won't see them till they men
And then my little partner man he just signed for ten
Where does the drama end
I put money on they books to try to ease they pain
Praying to the lord hoping they find peace again
And I give thanks for my life knowing so meet they end
I'ma survive, stay alive and keep my ass out the penn cause

[Chorus]

[Z-Ro]
I don't want to end up in jail
I don't want to end up in the penn
I don't want to end up in the ground
I don't want to end up like my friends - 2x

I don't want that to be me - 8x
