This ain't jail house talk this is real shit
Im tired of these hoes I need me a real woman to deal with
A white one a pretty and polite one
In search of a real man im hoping she might come
Kick it with me for a minute just to see what im about
And if you ain't feeling me baby girl im out
I ain't mad at cha
All im tryna do is get to know you
Baby im attracted any brother can lay you across a mattress
But what about pleasure with out sex
Yea I can make you cum back to back just me suckin on your neck
Down to your nipples
Down to your naval
Down to your imagination
But im trying to take you on vacation
Where ever you want to go
Where ever you want to be
Just let me know and its alright with me
Fuck the moon your smile can light up a city at night
You a sun im really hoping you turn out to be the one
That's why im trying to get to know ya



HOOK (x2)
Im not looking for a one night stand
Im looking for a woman that can appreciate a man
That's what I came here to do
To see if its you
Im digging you and if you dig me to
Can we kick it




A little a bout me
U already know im a G with A double T.I.T.U.D.E
But only those who mean me no good
But I can loosen me up but I feel like a positive relationship could
Every week week I catch a flight or take a cruise by my self
That's something I really wish I could do with somebody else
Don't get me wrong im not trying to come across like im lonely
Just trying to give you a opportunity to know me
Im a asshole by nature but a gentleman too
I beat up bitch niggas but I promise to be gentle with you
I know your job got you stressed out
Sweatin out your hair do
Put your feet up let the king of the ghetto take care of you
What your favorite food is I make it
And after i wine and dine you don't have to get naked
Your respected not tryin to be a special kind of fool
Im a king and I need a queen to help me rule
Im just tryin to get to know ya

HOOK (X2)

Your the brown skinned Barbie im the gangster Ken
I really can't explain the mood you put a gangster in
If its true if you are my boo
I would hurry and go do what I got to do so I can get back to you
I wasted a lot of time on these hateful chicks
These unfaithful and ungrateful chicks
I think its time for me to get what I deserve don't you feel like that
If you can keep it real I can keep it real like that
You will never have to worry about me and another woman
Youll be my out in the open plus my undercover woman
Happy to have you in my arms showing you off
Listening to what you have to tell me never blowing you off
I know the sun won't shine every day sometimes we will be in for bad weather
But we can go through it together
Well im looking for my woman cause she over due
All im tryin to do is see if she you
That's why im tryin to get to know ya
