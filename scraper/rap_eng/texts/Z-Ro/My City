[Verse 1]
Uh, I'm so glad I'm not stuck in the hood life
Always hating on Joseph McVey, but he wanna be just like Joseph McVey though
I got 20 bad bitches on speed dial and they do whatever I say, when I say so
And to never ever, ever, ever be a nigga like you is what I pray every day for
Look, I ain't never ever, never ever been a online gangster, that's gay, bro
Tough ass typing fingers and emoji banger, you be Ro watchin' every day, hoe
Yeah, they lookin' for ya, got our hood hot
Fuckin' with me, ya think I'ma play? No
I'll set this bitch off like I'm Boosie
Come on, I thought you said you was gon' do me
Oh, you tougher than a leather pork chop?
Boy, you must be livin' in a movie
Like that bitch that say she was gon' get me killed
I thought she wasn't gangster, but she sued me
They just mad at me 'cause I won't give them shit
Refuse to let a motherfucker use me
I am Mo City, Texas
Set up shop in Mo City, Texas, bet ya gotta go through me

[Hook]
Did this for my city, but I got a lot of haters in my city
Tried to starve me in my city, but I get a lot of paper in my city
It's not safe in my city, but I couldn't feel safer in my city
I don't need a pass, anywhere you wanna go, I can take you in my city
Did this for my city, but I got a lot of haters in my city
Tried to starve me in my city, but I get a lot of paper in my city
It's not safe in my city, but I couldn't feel safer in my city
I don't need a pass, anywhere you wanna go, I can take you in my city
(Ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy)

[Verse 2]
They givin' out days in my city
The people that don't even stay in my city
Overlooking people that stay in my city
That make shit happen everyday in my city
Barely see 'em, if I do see 'em
They don't never fuck with me when they in my city
Culture vultures on some Ted Bundy shit
All they be doing is raping my city
You think it's cool, but my people starvin'
And you look like a Pappadeaux plate in my city
It ain't all about codeine and cars, we a gangster, hope you stay safe in my city
I'm takin' city back where it's 'posed to be
On top of this shit like we used to
Got our own culture, got our own way of talkin'
We don't give a fuck what you do
Every time I see my people dickriding out-of-towners
I be like, "I'm too through!" (Traitor)
DJ's spinnin' out-of-town records like the hometown music boo-boo (Traitor)
Like, if you ain't Z-Ro, Kirko Bangz, Slim Thug, Lil Keke, or Bow Wop
They'll never play it, even if it's a hit
Iff y'all think that's cool, then fuck all y'all

[Hook]
Did this for my city, but I got a lot of haters in my city
Tried to starve me in my city, but I get a lot of paper in my city
It's not safe in my city, but I couldn't feel safer in my city
I don't need a pass, anywhere you wanna go, I can take you in my city
Did this for my city, but I got a lot of haters in my city
Tried to starve me in my city, but I get a lot of paper in my city
It's not safe in my city, but I couldn't feel safer in my city
I don't need a pass, anywhere you wanna go, I can take you in my city
(Ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy)

[Verse 3]
They say, "Ro ain't playin' fair, he got the cheat code
It been 20 years, like, how the fuck he still in beast mode?"
Bitch, don't give me my flowers when I'm dead
Hoe, you can keep those
No spine havin', soft hand shakin'
I told y'all they some he-hoes
[? 3:23]
Tryna kick it with a real nigga, I don't need no new amigos
Fake niggas can't say they real no mo'
I took that, that's been repoed
If I say you dead, then you dead to me
I can't even hear ya when ya speak, hoe

[Hook]
Did this for my city, but I got a lot of haters in my city
