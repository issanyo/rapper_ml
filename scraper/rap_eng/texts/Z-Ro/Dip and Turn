[Hook - 4x]
Swung then I swerve, dip as I turn
Pop my-pop my sip, and I burn

[Mr. Marcelo]
Slab I be dipping, lane to lane switching
Candy paint dripping, while I'm wood grain gripping
I sco' it up in H-Town, cook it in the kitchen
And drop it on the Northside, right there by my niggas
Now I'm on the Southside, where they make it pop
Bumping my nigga Z-Ro, Screwed Up and Chopped
Puffing on purple, sipping on purple
84 cannon lil' daddy, it's purple
I don't just talk, homie I live it
No bullshit nigga, this is square business
Yeah I swang, and I swerve
And I dip and I sip, and I never hit the curb

[Hook - 4x]

[Z-Ro]
I represent the legendary, Screwed Up Click
Fuck a girlfriend, I'm in a relationship with my blued up bitch
I bought her some chrome shoes to roll on, plus a wood grain wheel I hold on
And the stash spot got protection, plus the presidential kush I blow on
Lamborgini do's they open and close, while giving these haters hell
Drinking a pint of codeine, showing off my TV screens with Dave Chappelle
Got the big grill with my name in it, in candy blue letters
Checking ass niggas come and get it, the 3-57 will damage you fella

[Hook - 4x]

[Louie the 14th]
Suicide doors, with the guts cleaned out
Motorola chirping, must mean the fiends out
Blowing on purp', sipping on lean
Money over bitches nigga, get the getty-green
Butterfly doors, on a European whip
In the dope spot, with a European chick
Chopping on blades, bumping Young Pimp
Gripping wood grain, in a candy apple hemp
Rolling on swangas, finger on the trigger
Really ain't tripping on, snitching ass niggas
Billy goat grilling, leather all in it
Roof invisible, with the twelve inch vision

[Hook - 4x]
