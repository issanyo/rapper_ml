[Verse 1]
Yeah, I never thought it would be you
But it was you, I mean
Yeah I heard about the shit, I didn't wanna believe it
But it was true, I mean
All the shit I did for you, I mean
You actin' just like the nigga we talk 'bout
I can't believe a goddamn thing you be sayin'
Just like the nigga we talk about
We ain't got nothin' to talk about
I'm packin' my friendship, I'm walkin' out
I know you know they was gon' tell me what happened
One deep for life, that's what I'm all about
I can't show these niggas love no mo
I used to give a fuck but I don't give a fuck no mo
And I ain't wit' none of that arguin' shit
I'm gon' go in your mouth like a dentist
I'm not the one you gon' be arguin' with
You act like a man but don't act like it
I wanna know, tell me, are you a bitch?
Stop sayin' you didn't say it, I know you did
Bitch I can tell you what car you was in
Drunk motherfucker like my baby mama
Sayin' shit you won't remember
I know how you really feel about me homie
You ain't gotta be a pretender
At least stop sending that fake love to me
I gotta return to sender
Swear to God y'all act so hard
But I know all y'all soft and tender

[Chorus]
I ain't with none of this succa shit
I ain't with none of this succa shit
Like talkin' down on a nigga
To put me in a better position to fuck a bitch
I ain't with none of this succa shit
I ain't with none of this succa shit
Like puttin' my hands on stuff that don't belong to me
If it ain't mine I won't touch the shit
I ain't with none of this succa shit
I ain't with none of this succa shit
Like up in somebody else business
Ain't got shit to do with me, then I ain't up in it
I ain't with none of this succa shit
I ain't with none of this succa shit
Like sayin' some shit about him that I won't say to him
That's some fake nigga succa shit

[Verse 2]
Uh, the [?] on my tail
Somebody I fucked you fo
Bitch I'm a hoe celebrity
I don't know the nass celebrities that you know
I don't run my mouth 'bout shit I done did wit hoes
We did what we did, if they ask about me about you
I don't know you, that's how it goes
I don't talk it, I'm livin' it
I don't care if you got it, don't care if you gettin' it
I'm just mindin' my business, investin' in businesses
I don't remember her, can you please tell me what bitch it is?
I guess I don't give a fuck, straight like that
If I lose a person, cool, lose money, that's what I gotta make right back
Thought you was workin' for me, you was workin' for them
If I knew you was fake like that
Then I never would've showed you love
Got my people lookin' at me funny, my people don't know what you've done, succa shit
I'm a god, I hate when the devil come around and fuck with shit
No homo but he make it hard for me to keep my cool
I'm gon' fuck up some shit
Can't stand y'all niggas, can't stand y'all bitches no mo
Once you fuck over me I never ever forgive ya
I'm not fuckin' wit' ya no mo
I guess keepin' it real ain't cool no mo
When a real nigga come around, fake niggas, they don't know what to do no mo
I guess it's cool to be keeping it phony
You said you got love for your nigga
Why you talkin' 'bout him like he ain't your homie?
I guess the whole world done went crazy
I ain't tryna fuck with none of you niggas 'less you niggas tryna pay me
I guess I'm gon' keepin' on keepin' it one deep
One round pepper corn with cup of Maker's Mark
A family sized table with only one seat

[Chorus]
I ain't with none of this succa shit
I ain't with none of this succa shit
Like talkin' down on a nigga
To put me in a better position to fuck a bitch
I ain't with none of this succa shit
I ain't with none of this succa shit
Like puttin' my hands on stuff that don't belong to me
If it ain't mine I won't touch the shit
I ain't with none of this succa shit
I ain't with none of this succa shit
Like up in somebody else business
Ain't got shit to do with me, then I ain't up in it
I ain't with none of this succa shit
I ain't with none of this succa shit
Like sayin' some shit about him that I won't say to him
That's some fake nigga succa shit
