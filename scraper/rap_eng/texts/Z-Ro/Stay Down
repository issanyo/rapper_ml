[Verse 1]
Nigga you know what it is when you hear the GmB shit bitch
All eyes on me like I'm 2Pac
I got mine I don't give a fuck what you got
All I know is get mind get out the door
I'm just tryna pull out another foreign from my garage
Look what you need I got it soft I got it hard
If you got it and it wasn't right I was not involved
I was tripping with the nigga then I shot his jaw
Cuz I ain't letting nothing slide nigga, not at all
I know they hate me they ain't ever gonna stop at all
I know if I put my hands on them they'll get the cops involved
And I don't need that I'ma let a hater make it
Throwing success in haters faces watch them how they take it
They might play with you but I ain't the one that haters play with
Fucking with me they know they gon' die don't let haters make it
So if y'all know like I know y'all better calm down
And they ain't ever gon see y'all again I bet it's all now

[Chorus]
I stay down until I came up
I promise I will never change up
When real niggas bring my name up
They say that's my nigga not cuz I'm famous
I stay down until I came up
I promise I will never change up
When real niggas bring my name up
They say that's my nigga not cuz I'm famous

[Verse 2]
I'm turned up like a summer jam
Put up my spring money working with my summer bands
I don't fuck with that after season that's just my summer mans
Believe none of what I hand half of what I see
Like so and so said what then they end enough with me
I see this broadway winner digging me then she come for me
I don't pay for anything not even attention hoe I'm sucker free
You know we smoking on that live not that hooker bi
You must be trying to lay it down tryna fuck with me
Whenever your woman come around she be touching me
But you ain't gotta worry y'all broke and I don't fuck for free
I keep with chopper in the backseat
I would leave that boys roll alone if you ask me
Only way home he can get a pass if he ask me
Or I'll put 50 thousand on his head that's his ass J
Most cities done but they call me cuz I run the city
Beside Dereck Franklin don't nobody run it with me
Still waiting for you pussy niggas to come and get me
Mad at me cuz when I touch that million dollar you ain't touch it with me
I mellow in it all I swear it's so funny
Mad at my hustle cuz your hustle ain't making no money
Running for real nigga president so vote for me
Don't walk up on me across the street is way to close for me

[Chorus]
I stay down until I came up
I promise I will never change up
When real niggas bring my name up
They say that's my nigga not cuz I'm famous
I stay down until I came up I promise
I will never change up
When real niggas bring my name up
They say that's my nigga not cuz I'm famous
