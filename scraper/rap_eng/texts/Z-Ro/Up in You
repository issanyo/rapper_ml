[Intro]
B-b-b-beanz N Kornbread

[Chorus]
I know why you always drippin'
I must be what you missin'
I'm comin' through
I'm touchin' you
I'm up in you tonight (I'm up in you tonight)
I know why you always drippin'
I'm comin' through (I am)
I'm touchin' you (And I am)
I'm up in you tonight (I'm up in you tonight)

[Verse 1]
Uh, the way I make it rotate
I could make a gay woman go straight
I'm on the way to yo place
No lemon pepper but we drinkin' ros√©
And I know how you feel
So I'ma take my time
I'ma go so deep in you
You gonna be like "daddy break my spine"
If you want it you can have it
I won't make you beg (Make you beg)
Got you soundin' like a swimmin' pool baby
'Cause you way too wet (Way too wet)
Uh, up in ya like a pap smeer
How long can you last there?
When I'm done I see the way you lookin' at me
Like I hope you brought an overnight baggie

[Chorus]
I know why you always drippin'
I must be what you missin'
I'm comin' through
I'm touchin' you
I'm up in you tonight (I'm up in you tonight)
I know why you always drippin'
I'm comin' through (I am)
I'm touchin' you (And I am)
I'm up in you tonight (I'm up in you tonight)

[Verse 2]
Ayy, ya wanna be my main squeeze baby, don't ya? (That's right)
Wanna give me your house keys baby, don't ya? (That's right)
'Cause I be fuckin' ya so goddamn good
You'll risk your freedom, move a key for me baby, won't ya (Go get it, you gon' get wit' it)
Gotta be at work at 8 in the mornin'
You already know you gon' be late in the mornin'
I gotta be in another state in the mornin'
All I need is eggs n' pancakes in the mornin' (Ha-ha)
And even when ya mad at me I could still get it (Yeah)
'Cause seem like I never come, I just live in it (Yeah)
Three or fo hours later I am still in it (Yeah)
And when I'm done, ya say it feel like I'm still in it (Yeah)
If that thing ain't bald-headed fix that (Oh)
Here go the razor, I'll see ya when ya get back (Oh)
What ya runnin' fo, calm down sit back
Got me doin' cardio, I'm workin' on my six pack

[Chorus]
I know why you always drippin'
I must be what you missin'
I'm comin' through
I'm touchin' you
I'm up in you tonight (I'm up in you tonight)
I know why you always drippin'
I'm comin' through (I am)
I'm touchin' you (And I am)
I'm up in you tonight (I'm up in you tonight)
