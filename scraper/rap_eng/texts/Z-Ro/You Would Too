[Verse 1]
So many fake ass faces on the block
Baby five K one working for the police
The only way they gon make it on the block
I used to be a damn fool if you needed me to
Give me a cake and I'ma bake it on the spot
Since the day before the day before the day before
That's how long Joseph made vaping on the clock
Young niggas don't respect a damn thing
I promise they shooting up everything out here
I ain't ever need a gun whoop nigga one on one
He gon live and he gon feel a lot of pain out here
Ain't ever want to trip with my people
I pray highly intense with my people
I'd rather smoke a zip with my people
Hoover crept is my people but I got a lot of love for blood niggas too
And my wish is my people
Can't stop turning their back on each other
Stop holding us down start uplifting my people
It's just like we the KKK too
Cuz all we be doing is ledging our people
Let's get it together stop rubbing each other
Let's get it together like China town
Until you pussy ass niggas wanna keep tripping
I'ma come through and shut your vagina down

[Chorus]
Nigga you were too if you knew
What this game would do to you
Living this shit since 92
Look at all the bullshit I've been through
So-called beef with you know who
Fucked a few female stars too
Then I blew like nigga move like my shit not to be fucked with
Nigga you were too if you knew
What this game would do to you
Been in this shit since 92
Look at all the bullshit I've been through
So-called beef with you know who
Fucked a few female stars too
Then I blew like nigga move like my shit not to be fucked with

[Verse 2]
If you could be like if I bout to call out my music
And wheels out by necklaces and watches you bout to grill
Now all I can get from you is just get killed
I'm not your partner no more I'm just a meal
Got all of this money with no record deal
I don't owe you nothing give a fuck how you feel
To get mad at one of my people just to get a couple of box out the deal
And they wonder my attitude be like fuck all y'all
Minding my own business don't want your number
I'm not gon' call
My nigga you were too if you knew
What this game would do to you
I'm grown I ain't doing the things that I used to do
I ain't got a damn thing to prove to you
I'm just living my life
Trying to rays rich and trying to stay high
Broken law I know how you feel cuz these niggas ain't real
They here you knocking but they won't open the door
And I don't give a fuck I say I don't give a fuck about none of these hoes
You know the last bitch I fucked with
Made me think back at every last one of these hoes

[Chorus]
Nigga you were too if you knew
What this game would do to you
Living this shit since 92
Look at all the bullshit I've been through
So-called beef with you know who
Fucked a few female stars too
Then I blew like nigga move like my shit not to be fucked with
Nigga you were too if you knew
What this game would do to you
Been in this shit since 92
Look at all the bullshit I've been through
So-called beef with you know who
Fucked a few female stars too
Then I blew like nigga move like my shit not to be fucked with
