[Intro]
I'm rocking like a cut off stocking
In the penitentiary trynna' get waves ya' dig?

[Verse 1]
I don't know about you but I know what I'ma do
I roll one deep I don't roll with the crew
I don't know a lot of real niggas, only know a few
And this time next year I'ma only know two
It's a storm in front of me but I gotta' go through it
I'm make it to the other side where the sun shine
One deep entertainment we always get money
And we always eat,  its always lunchtime
Record label tried to starve me out, but I was still getting fat
When you're blessed by the best, it just be like that
If somebody stole two I got three right back
Wonder why G-O-D love me like that
Cause I know I really ain't worthy
Let a nigga live when them niggas tried to murk me
Said I was gonna' die but I made it through the surgery
I started general rolling, baby momma tried to serve me
I don't even know this bitch
The opposite of cool is what I'ma show this bitch
When you talking about Joseph McVey he don't love nothing
Homie you should already know this shit
Bitch planned her whole life with her man but her man ain't even in the plan
Always telling other women about their relationship but this bitch ain't even got a man  (Cause you a THOT ho)
And even though they wanna' ruin me
I be giving out a whole lot of money and provide opportunities
But I am not like him, I don't do it just cause a camera following me in my community
I know why Grady and Rick D never switched up
Didn't matter if it was dollar bills or big bucks
Cause real niggas do real shit
If you a pussy you somebody I'ma deal with

[Hook]
Where the real niggas at?
Look to the left, look to the right but I don't see none
Where the real bitches at?
Know you ain't real just another fake bitch trynna' be one
You should I already know that the haters gon' hate
We don't give a fuck
If you ain't talking 'bout money get the fuck out of my face
We don't give a fuck
Where the real niggas at?
Look to the left, look to the right but I don't see none
Where the real bitches at?
Know you ain't real just another fake bitch trynna' be one
You should I already know that the haters gon' hate
We don't give a fuck
If you ain't talking 'bout money get the fuck out of my face
We don't give a fuck

[Verse 2]
I know you don't want to see me shine
Wanna see me fucked up nigga but I'm doing just fine
Ain't even Kevin Gates but I got six jobs, I am on my grind
Can't worry 'bout no bitch, that type of shit ain't never on my mind
Fraud ass niggas like to smile in my face, they don't know I know they hate me man
They can get the forty five to the face cause you know it ain't ever on safety man
You can say what you want around me, I can't even remember to give a fuck
This table for the real niggas and the real bitches y'all know y'all can't sit with us
(Vandross) If a player hater go to player hating I'ma let my little hitters hit em' then
We make murder movies and we work with uzis, you don't want to be in this predicament
I've been going in like a bad ass kid that can't come back outside
Kill a nigga, kill a bitch, kill a dog knock the fish tank over and make sure that nigga's house die, Burn that shit down
But I don't wanna' be like that so don't fuck with me like that
That's the main reason every time y'all come around I'm always like I'ma be right back
A bunch of fake people trying to be around a nigga like me trying to soak up some real shit
Get the fuck away from me the game ain't free, not even a little bit bitch but all I wanna know

[Hook]
Where the real niggas at?
Look to the left, look to the right but I don't see none
