[Chorus: Z-Ro]
Z-ro must be out his mind
Think i'ma let'em rap on my song
Then my song won't even be my song
We can't let that nigga shine
If we do, the real niggas gon' be on
If they get on, it won't be safe to leave home
Z-ro must be out his mind
Think we gon' let him on a big stage
And get paid the same way we get paid
We can't let that nigga shine
If we do, we gon' pray the devil away and ain't nobody gon' listen to what he say

[Verse 1: Z-Ro]
I heard somebody told drake i wasn't feelin' the song
Ya'll know i would've been on it and been killing the song
It would have got me a couple of mo' million alone
But it's all good, i got a couple of million at home
"Z-Ro, why you ain't in magazines or in the blogs?"
Bitch I'm still up in the streets with my LOCs and my dogs
Real kush in the video, we don't fuck with fog
And if ya'll ain't some real niggas we don't fuck with ya'll
They don't want a real nigga coming up like bubbles in 7up
They want a nigga thats gon' bow down'n out, shoot you down as soon as you're steppin' up
My knees don't bend unless i'm prayin', man...
I put no man before my god, 'fuck is you sayin', man?
"Ro, why these rappers want your hooks and not your verses?"
Cause soon as i get to rappin', their career roll off in hearses
Can't look me in my eye or shake my hand cause they too nervous
I'm tough as a leather pork chop and these bitches is real sherbet

[Chorus: Z-Ro]
Z-ro must be out his mind
Think i'ma let'em rap on my song
Then my song won't even be my song
We can't let that nigga shine
If we do, the real niggas gon' be on
If they get on, it won't be safe to leave home
Z-ro must be out his mind
Think we gon' let him on a big stage
And get paid the same way we get paid
We can't let that nigga shine
If we do, we gon' pray the devil away and ain't nobody gon' listen to what he say

[Verse 2: Z-Ro]
Rozay and Yo Gotti, appreciate the verse...
I was able to get circles of white and squares of purp'...
Shout out to Gucci for doin' Haters Got Me Wrong...
I don't want shit for free, i wanted to pay him for the song
I got a lot of haters hatin' on me
A couple jackers 'round the corner and they waitin' on me
If i die, no, i ain't gon' be what satan gon' be
But while i'm here go on'n make the strippers get naked for me
Much love to Killer Mike, i fuck with B.o.B
Whenever i'm in A-T-L, they always fuck with me
R.i.p. Pimp C, he told me not to fuck for free
And bust a niggas' head open if they fuck with me

[Chorus: Z-Ro]
Z-ro must be out his mind
Think i'ma let him rap on my song
Then my song won't even be my song
We can't let that nigga shine
If we do, the real niggas gon' be on
If they get on, it won't be safe to leave home
Z-ro must be out his mind
Thinkin' we gon' let him on a big stage
And get paid the same way we get paid
We can't let that nigga shine
If we do, we gon' pray the devil away and ain't nobody gon' listen to what he say

[Verse 3: Z-Ro]
"Ro if you ain't wearin' these, you can't cash checks"
Bullshit, them ain't no jeans, them some spandex
If i did that, i couldn't live with myself
Never sell out for the money, keep it real with myself
I am not touchin' my dick but i am feelin' myself
Won't rub him, baby need you killin' myself
I'm from the wish-a-rapper-woods
I wish a rapper would
Get at me on your song, thats cool
I'm gon' get at your hood
So you're a hot boy, huh?
You better cool it
Man, I just found it, I promise ya'll don't want me to lose it
Real gangsta-shit ain't got shit to do with no music
They tough on wax but friendly in person, it's so confusing...
Last time i saw Lil' Wayne it was hugs and daps
At mad studios with kush buds and 'rillo wraps...
Drankin' syrup, gettin' high like a motherfucker
Who say 'Ro ain't real? They a lie like a motherfucker

[Chorus: Z-Ro]
Z-ro must be out his mind
Think i'ma let'em rap on my song
Then my song won't even be my song
We can't let that nigga shine
If we do, the real niggas gon' be on
If they get on, it won't be safe to leave home
Z-ro must be out his mind
Think we gon' let him on a big stage
And get paid the same way we get paid
We can't let that nigga shine
If we do, we gon' pray the devil away and ain't nobody gon' listen to what he say
