Come with me
Gun with me
Do you wanna ride or die

[Chorus]
Come with me, real niggas ain't no bums with me
What do we have here now? Do you wanna ride or die?

[Verse 1]
I'm out on bond but I thank god cause right now I'm not in jail
Trying to hang me over nothing can't tell me I'm not in hell
Ain't got shit on me so they wanna catch me making a sale
Just wanna lock up a rapper to have a story to tell
If I was walking she keep walking since I'm not she gon' choose me
Cause it got 200 on the dash and the "B" on its booty
The inside look like a basketball call it Spaulding in here
Feel like i play for Houston Rockets bitch I'm balling in here
Sign this disclosure no picture taking no calling in here
Sit up straight and don't touch nothing act like the law is in here
Go head and take off your panties take off your bra up in here
It's just marijuana, cocaine ain't what you saw up in here

[Chorus]
Come with me, don't be afraid I've got my gun with me
What do we have here now? Do you wanna ride or die?
Come with me, real niggas ain't no bums with me
What do we have here now? Do you wanna ride or die?

[Verse 2]
Look 2002 drove an intrepid all through mo-city Texas
Drunk so much codeine my nasal passage was never congested
Now when I wake up i just might blow 1000 on breakfast
This ain't your usual salad that ain't no regular lettuce
I got a hell of a schedule I got a lot going on
Everyday it seem like i say look like we not going home
I don't talk to these broads
I only talk money on my phone
If they ain't coming with none of that
They can't come in my home
I love my haters for hating me cause they keep me promoted
They're the reason i get more money but they dont even know it
Assault rifle in every room in case they come kick my door in
I know they think I'm a rapper they better watch where they going

[Chorus]
Come with me, don't be afraid I've got my gun with me
What do we have here now? Do you wanna ride or die?
Come with me, real niggas ain't no bums with me
What do we have here now? Do you wanna ride or die?

[Verse 3]
Nine people murdered in the church my nigga I ain't the one
I'm in here singing and praying but I brought more than one gun
Police don't write no more tickets just trying to murder someone
Might as well say rest in peace as soon as another one come
They on my bumper if I go left then they making a left
Want me to reach for my wallet so they can tase me to death
Mad at me cause what they make in a year I make in one check
Mad at me cause I did that shit without me breaking a sweat
I'm on my way to pick up a bag hoe you making me late
I got a warrant and the jail is where you taking me straight
Knock out my bond and my lawyer without me breaking the bank
Back at the crib before you get off bitch I'm dranking some drank

[Chorus]
Come with me, don't be afraid I've got my gun with me
What do we have here now? Do you wanna ride or die?
Come with me, real niggas ain't no bums with me
What do we have here now? Do you wanna ride or die?
