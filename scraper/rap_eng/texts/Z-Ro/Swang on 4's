(Big Moe)
Swangers, and droppers, Southside
We're gonna ball baby, living so lavishly
And you know that I'm grabbin' grain
Wreckshopping all night long baby
Swang on 4's with me

[Slimm Chance]
Swang 4's with me, come roll with me
As you po cold cups I'ma smoke the tree
Make tracks stop, beating up the block
Ass end hop on the 4's and chop
Can't let these haters take what I got
Blue over silver, fresh out the shop
Some gone bop, the lighters gone light
That's why I keep Glocks with the infrared dot
No time to plex, got to push the lex
Keep them diamonds shining round my neck
Shots of chrome while I'm on the phone
Popping legs walking in my home
Walking through the doors, on marble floors
Chandeliers and studios
Got to pimp the pen, when I'm in the wind
And swanging 4's with optimos

[Hook - 2x]
Swang on 4's with me, and I like it
Shooting spiders off my rims cause I'm ridin' on 4's
Swang on 4's with me, oooooh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Shooting spiders off my rims cause I'm ridin' on 4's

[Z-Ro]
Oooooooh I'm on swanger, with wood grain
All on my dash, when I pass I'm looking oh so clean
One in the chamber they must be
Out of their minds if they're trying to take my bitch from me
I won't be taken, releasing shots from my gun
Ain't the one to get took off my four
Cause I know these jackers be waiting
That's why I'm strapped at all times, I think you better let it go

[Hook - 2x]

[Z-Ro]
Bubble lights they shining bright, boguard in the turning lane
I'ma ride candy coat, then I'ma play with a remote working with wood grain
Z-Ro gone bleed the block not with the rocks, I bleed red like the flesh
It ain't no more hoops, just candy Coupes rings filed in the STS
Hell yeah got a gun and beam, and I make you scream
I work too hard when I grind, for niggas that wanna take my shit
And niggas will get hit, I promise these fellas gone mind
If I got to pull my piece to make a hater retreat
Then I'ma focus on taking him out with red dots, they will smell
It in the wind 'fore they try to move in I'm busting in the parking lot
In a big body Dave &Taylor ain't no Honda
Going the wrong way on the one way, screens falling
Like rain drops, they gonna try and jack me one day
But I'm armed and dangerous, eliminated the plex
When it came to us unlike these marks
I aim to bust, riding on 84's ain't no game to us
Realizing that there ain't no changing us, re-arranging us
Homicide be naming us, drunk too many 4's now there ain't no waking up
And yella bones be paging us, and steady broads be claiming us
But I'ma hit my switch, drop the top and unlock my kit
From South Post Oak to  Laura Koppe, we swinging bitch
