Hold up bitch

[Verse 1]
Don't run up on me with that touchy feely I don't play that shit
If you the DJ and I give you a record to play you gotta play that shit
Got something to say about Rodo
Don't bite your tongue let nigga stay that shit
You smile at my face but you talk about me like a dog
Nigga really hate that shit
Haters looking for me they been asking 'round
They want the palm back it to roll my casket down
I used to really put real money on my head
But I got a credit card I really do it with the plastic now
I'm the king of Houston Texas been had the crown
Tell the mother fellows they can sit their asses down
I know they fake but they ain't gotta stay fake
They can learn to be real I'm teaching classes now
Call me professor Ro I'm a real go get in
No matter what I'm doing ima go get the dope
So far from the hood she gon have to find a ride
I'm not a Ãœber bitch I won't go get a hoe
Hoe hope a Girl Scout cooking right in front of my face
Ain't even go smoke with my bro
Fuck, fuck that nigga he don't even know I know
He was butt naked trying to do coke with my hoe

[Chorus]
Hold up bitch
Hold up bitch
Hold up bitch
Hold up bitch
Hold up bitch
Hold up bitch
Hold up bitch
Hold up bitch
Hold up bitch (hold up hoe)
Hold up bitch (hold up hoe)
Hold up bitch (hold up hoe)
Hold up bitch (hold up hoe)
Hold up bitch (hold up hoe)
Hold up bitch (hold up hoe)
Hold up bitch (hold up hoe)
Hold up bitch (hold up hoe)
Hold up bitch

[Verse 2]
My money right to much money left
Bad bitch tryna figure out why she ain't got a call from me yet
20 thousand dollars worth of alcohol Kush that's how crazy my money get
Got 20 nigga bitches in the boo hot then
Like it fuck it my phone and my money went
Represent most cities till I can't no more
Ima keep drinking till there ain't no more
All I do is make deposit after deposit
My haters ain't going to the bank no more
I don't wanna be in a holy tank no more
How I did that shit I can't take no more
Look if I'm in prison with you that would mean that I can't get no pussy
I put my money in safe no more
I know these haters wanna see me fall but I ain't let the haters see that
If they hit me so bad then why every time I turn around
They wanna be what I be at
I be haunted by the ill direction I give a hater every reason to be mad
Even my ex bitch wanna be my next bitch
Bitch please you will never get me back

[Chorus]
Hold up bitch
Hold up bitch
Hold up bitch
Hold up bitch
Hold up bitch
Hold up bitch
Hold up bitch
Hold up bitch
Hold up bitch (hold up hoe)
Hold up bitch (hold up hoe)
Hold up bitch (hold up hoe)
Hold up bitch (hold up hoe)
Hold up bitch (hold up hoe)
Hold up bitch (hold up hoe)
Hold up bitch (hold up hoe)
Hold up bitch (hold up hoe)
Hold up bitch
