[Chorus]
They don't understand
I am just a man
I'm doing all I can
That's all
I be tripping all the time lord
They think I'm out my mind lord
You know I'm really trying lord
That's all

[Verse 1]
Maybe I'm crazy (Crazy)
I don't know (I don't know)
Wherever y'all been hanging lately (That's where y'all at?)
Thats where I don't go (I ain't coming through there then)
I be one deep on the daily (daily)
Cause I'm too real (cause I'm too real)
I ain't coming around unless you pay me
And I don't give a fuck how y'all feel (Y'all know I don't give a fuck)
Cause I never had love for a bitch (Bitch)
I'm about my money (Well)
Like a million dollar player, how I carry myself (carry myself)
Can't no woman have my heart cause I'm gon' marry myself (unnhh)
And I never had love for a nigga (nigga)
I'm about my money (Well)
Even if they murder me I ain't going nowhere (going nowhere)
Turn up the volume to the radio I'll be right there (unnhh)

[Chorus]
They don't understand
I am just a man
I'm doing all I can
That's all
I be tripping all the time lord
They think I'm out my mind lord
You know I'm really trying lord
That's all

[Verse 2]
Take a look at my life (my life)
Everybody round here so shife (shife)
No love, no sacrifice (nah)
Fellas in the street ain't acting right (oh)
Take a look at my life (my life)
Everybody round here so shife
Even when I'm in a crowded room I feel by myself
Everybody's fake I guess I'll keep it real by myself
When I catch a fake nigga doing fake nigga shit
He gon' be mad at a nigga like me
You know I call it like I see it
That's why I don't come around
If I don't say nothing that ain't me (Vandross)
Look here if you fucked over me I ain't trying to get you back
I forgive you, you can hit me up but I won't hit you back
They say you and Trae the Truth need to squash the beef and get back to work
But I've been hated so much I can't even see how that could work

[Chorus]
They don't understand
I am just a man
I'm doing all I can
That's all
I be tripping all the time lord (I be tripping)
They think I'm out my mind lord (Out of my mind)
You know I'm really trying lord (Yeah)
That's all

They think I'm out my mind
Cause I be tripping all the time
And I don't need ya
And I don't want ya
And I don't love ya
I'm never thinking of ya
Hoe Bitch
Vandross
