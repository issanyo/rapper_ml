Dome, kush, and codeine
You know that combination really makes me lean
Dome, kush, and codeine
Her lips, cigarillo, and the A&W Cream
Dome, kush, and codeine
You know that combination really makes me lean
Dome, kush, and codeine
Her lips, cigarillo, and the A&W Cream

[Verse 1]
Rother, yeah
If you get in the bed with me tonight
In the mornin' you gon' have to call in
Cause imma treat you greasy, spit
Like the end of summer, imma fall in
Can't forget the cigarillos, I can't forget the A&W Cream
I can't forget the codeine
Really diggin' yo hips, but I'm thinkin' about yo lips
Not talkin' about the ones in yo jeans
Don't fake it, give it to me until I can't take it
Until I wanna slap you
Swear to God you a Hoover, but not one of my dueces
I'm talkin' bout a vaccum
I used to love pig feet
But right now it's Bust One Up In Your Wig Week
Get the Listerine, gargle, and then speak
I don't wanna have sex I just want them cheeks
Uh

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Preach
Lil' mama you already know what I want from you
We gon' smoke sumn, we gon' drank sumn, and go through
All these condoms that's what we're gonna do
I put a duck in a Strawberry Crush I'm feelin' real lovely
I ask her why she don't fuck me
She say she bust a nut every time she suck me
We smokin' louda than loud, and my Styrofoam so muddy
She might charge y'all fellas a fee
But she put her lips on me for no money, playa

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Uh
I think I'm TV Johnny
Yellow bones wanna give me dome
Anytime I'm with TV Johnny the
Yellow bones wanna take me home
With or without my PO's permission
Anywhere I choose I roam
Yeah you fine as hell but let me see yo ID
Cause I gotta make sure you grown
What I look like messin' with a minor
I'm a grown up, I need a grown vagina
Homie you a pedophile tryna fit inside her
You oughta be ashamed nigga, read yo bible
But if she the right age she can open up
We in the hotel rollin' up, pourin' up
Knockin' pictures off the wall, yeah you know it's us
Get sucked up, get a bag and a bust

[Hook]
