[Chorus: Mickaël Zibi & Z-Ro]
Now I don't care what them haters say
Haters always runnin’ their mouth
Make a nigga wanna run in they mouth
Now I don't care what them haters say
Nothin' positive gon’ come from they mouth
Make me wanna put my gun in they mouth
Now I don't care what them haters say
Everything a nigga do somethin' good
They be like a nigga ain't no good
No I don't care what them haters say
I don't care what they say about me
Even though I wish a bitch, I wish a nigga would

[Verse 1: Z-Ro]
Uh, my baby mamas is so disrespectful
I guess they still mad at me 'cause they still in the ghetto
Remember you sayin' bitch go platinum, man I got a smile (Ha-ha)
Got people lookin’ at me funny, you tell a lotta lies
Yo hand nails ain’t go shit to do with our child
That's why you mad and you put them people in our lives
Shit, but I ain’t mad at ya, not at all
I just wonder if Keke know the reason I'm not involved
Daddy love ya baby, you ain't gotta think about it
Whenever you need me, you ain't even gotta think about it
And when it come to Paris, I’ma have to think about it
Just hope you learn from your mistakes, I hope you think about it
I know ya mama gotcha actin' like that
If it was Whitney from the jump, it wouldn't have happened like that
They say I'm a deadbeat, that's what they gonna say
Fuck a baby mama, my children need me, I'm on my way

[Chorus: Mickaël Zibi & Z-Ro]
Now I don't care what them haters say
Haters always runnin' their mouth
Make a nigga wanna run in they mouth
Now I don't care what them haters say
Nothin' positive gon' come from they mouth
Make me wanna put my gun in they mouth
Now I don't care what them haters say
Everything a nigga do somethin' good
They be like a nigga ain't no good
No I don't care what them haters say
I don't care what they say about me
Even though I wish a bitch, I wish a nigga would

[Verse 2: Z-Ro]
Lil Calvin should've been the only one to get a chain (One deep)
Them other niggas wasn't with me, they was with the fame (One deep)
You know me, always showin' love so I'm who get the blame
Treated them like brothers even though I didn't get the same (Fuck it)
When everybody broke they listen what you gotta say
And you gon' see 'em right after they say they on they way
But if they ballin' they gon' act just like they don't know ya (What)
Feel like they ain't yo people no mo, they about to show ya (Oh we actin' different, different)
And then they wonder why I'm so selfish now
'Cause I done bought niggas cars tryna help 'em out (There he go)
And you know they gon' say I never helped 'em out (Say what?)
'Cause all they give a fuck about is who gon' help them now
This nigga goin' back and forth between the twin towers
That's me and Trae Tha Truth, this nigga Envy is gettin' ours (Ha-ha)
I drop an album, he be on my dick (On my dick)
This nigga Trae drop an album, I'm who he don't fuck wit' (Don't fuck wit')
These are the fruits of my labor, you ain't gon' touch shit (Gon' touch shit)
And what I earn I promise ain't nobody gon' fuck wit' (Ah, you goddamn bitch)
You soundin' like a hater to me like I didn't raise ya
Fuck it, as long as I'm gettin' paid

[Chorus: Mickaël Zibi & Z-Ro]
Now I don't care what them haters say
Haters always runnin' their mouth
Make a nigga wanna run in they mouth
Now I don't care what them haters say
Nothin' positive gon' come from they mouth
Make me wanna put my gun in they mouth
Now I don't care what them haters say
Everything a nigga do somethin' good
They be like a nigga ain't no good
No I don't care what them haters say
I don't care what they say about me
Even though I wish a bitch, I wish a nigga would
Hey, uh

[Outro: Mickaël Zibi]
No I don't care what them haters say
No I don't care what them haters say
No I don't care what them haters say
