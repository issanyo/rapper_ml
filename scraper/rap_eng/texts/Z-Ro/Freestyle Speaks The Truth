If you don't look good then I don't look good
We don't look good, that's right
If you don't look good then I don't look good
Bitch you better bring me my cheese
If you don't look good then I don't look good
We don't look good, that's right
If you don't look good then I don't look good
Bitch you better bring me my cheese

I don't love you
Matter fact I don't ever think of you
I could think of better shit for me to do
Like chasing a million dollars with my motha fucking crew
I miss my nigga DJ Screw
30 miles per hour on the freeway fool
Leaning like we need a V-8
But I always kept my eyes open to make sure we straight
Now I'm the mo' city don, I got my crown homie
Watch your mouth unless you wanna be underground homie
Your bitch ya bitch come get her, cause once I sit her down homie
Your bitch gonna be my bitch, all you can do is frown homie
We can handle this like men or get into gangsta shit
5 duece hoover crip damn right I'm a gangsta bitch
Lips hips and fingertips make a gangsta rich
All these yellow blue and black diamonds I sure thank ya bitch

If you don't look good then I don't look good
We don't look good, that's right
If you don't look good then I don't look good
Bitch you better bring me my cheese
If you don't look good then I don't look good
We don't look good, that's right
If you don't look good then I don't look good
Bitch you better bring me my cheese

[Talking]

Yeah, Feel so good to be free
Finally came home from the penitentiary
Applesauce and yellow grits, that ain't breakfast
T-Bone steak and eggs back in screwed up Texas
Ain't a thing change, everything still the same
Hatas still hate and gangbangas still bang
Police still fuck wit anybody that's making change
Snitches still need a record deal cause they still sing
You ain't no woman you a bitch to me
And a friend, still ain't shit to me
Everytime I make a hundred thousand dollars, here they come
If I'm doin bad, they the ones I don't hear from
Yall niggas ain't real like H.A.W.K. and Screw
And since yall ain't them, yall the ones I'm talking to
Yall niggas ain't shit, yall pussy and some tits
But got the nerve to say that yous a blood or a crip
First one to set trip, but the first one to run
Own six or seven guns, but you never shot one
I pray toward the sun, every day before I'm done
When it rain on me it ain't water, it's money by the ton
I'm only one man with an Earth worth of foes
They hate me in the hood, in public, and at my shows
If looks could kill, I'd die when they ride by
But ask them why they hate me and they don't know why
Send a nigga through hell and back, and then they send me to prison
But check me out homie, I'm free and I'm still living
So many women and men don't want me to win
I got God, that's why they bullets can't break my skin
Roll foreign in the winter, American in the spring
Any other time I play a stretch hummer limousine
Whether you see me in person or in a magazine
I keep bags of purple, ain't no more bags of green
A white t-shirt, whites ones and blue jeans
The MVP and the only playa on my team
The females scream cause I'm the man of they dreams
I'm represented by my piece and chain watch and my ring
Yeah I'm on the radio, yeah I'm on the television
But raisin' my daughter is the most important mission
No more whippin chickens up in the kitchen, nigga please
If me [daughters name] ain't shoppin, then we at Chucky Cheese
I drop a lot of CD's, thats how I make G's
So much ice in my mouth, my breath is a cool breeze
Pardon my rainbow, a playa just had to sneeze
My game tight 360 degrees
I ain't a fresh prince, I'm a cot sucking king
This ain't a pistol this is a mutha fucking machine
50 calibre brown, is something you never seen
Big enough to hit, when it miss, and it don't need a beam
I shake a lot of hands, walk across a lot of stages
My signature go at the bottom of a lot of pages
Even without a diamond, I'll still shine bright
And I hog the limelight, that's because I rhyme tight
Kush keep my mind right, cause I stress so bad
Sometimes I lose my temper and get so mad
But a voice say "Ro focus, and get yo cash"
Wanna know if I do that? You better bet yo ass
