[Chorus]
I don't trust nary one of these niggas, not one of these bitches
It's always one deep for life, that's how I handle my business
Same one do the crime with ya, fuck around and turn into a witness
They ain't going to do the time with you though, cause the law loves snitches
I don't trust nary one of these niggas, not one of these bitches (nary one of these bitches)
It's always one deep for life, that's how I handle my business (Handle my business)
Same one do the crime with ya, fuck around and turn into a witness (turn into a witness)
They ain't going to do the time with you though, cause the law loves snitches (Man)

[Verse 1]
All my life I been
Saying I don't need no help my nigga
Or need no fake ass friends
I can do this by myself my nigga
Be down in a one-seater Benz
Music banging I'm going deaf my nigga
Wanna go back to the penn'
Cause in that bitch I can't cash no check my nigga
Up in Colorado Springs just me and big ray and a fat ass broad but she mad at me
I don't really give a damn nonchalant is who i am give a fuck if a broad throwing that ass at me
I need 225 lbs of leave me alone
I got a whole lot of rooms at the crib but you can't spend the night go home
LOL but I'm serious though what you looking for what you so curious for
You trying to steal something huh
Ooh, I wish a motherfucker would you already know Z-Ro gon' kill something huh
Pussy ass nigga on the internet showing all his guns but he ain't gon' kill nothing huh

[Chorus]
I don't trust nary one of these niggas, not one of these bitches

[Verse 2]
I'm in my own lane, nothing to say so I never speed (Hello?)
I'm doing my own thing
Its in my lap not under the seat
Homie don't get a blown brain
You gon' make me decorate the street
But I ain't really trying to go there
I don't want to cook your ass medium-rare
Always worried about what the fuck I be doing, and
Worried about what the fuck I be spending, and
Worried about who the fuck I be screwing, and
Worried about where the fuck I be chilling, you
Probably wanna send a hit team to come and hit me
Thinking you gon' catch me off guard with my finger not on the trigger
But bitch please
I'm always ready
And I ain't talking bout a .25 ain't talking bout a .38 either
I'm always heavy
He twitter beefing and he instabanging
He a facebook faggot little dog ain't deadly
I pull up on the scene with that murder machine empty the magazine and get away clean
Niggas know what i mean

(Cancel your insurance policy bitch nigga
Rother Vandross
One deep for life)

[Chorus]
I don't trust nary one of these niggas, not one of these bitches
It's always one deep for life, that's how I handle my business
Same one do the crime with ya, fuck around and turn into a witness
They ain't going to do the time with you though, cause the law loves snitches
I don't trust nary one of these niggas, not one of these bitches (nary one of these bitches)
It's always one deep for life, that's how I handle my business (Handle my business)
Same one do the crime with ya, fuck around and turn into a witness (turn into a witness)
They ain't going to do the time with you though, cause the law loves snitches (Man)

[Verse 3]
How the hell you on my team
But you passing the ball to the people I be playing against
And you wonder why you broke
Can't even afford a drank and a smoke
You ain't bringing in shit
What you making them rich
Old dumb ass nigga
About to be a bum ass nigga
Satisfied with a crumb ass nigga
I'm a give it here nigga
I bet if you don't give it here nigga
Hoover gon' get the kill in here nigga
I don't trust my hoes
And I don't trust my bros
I only trust my AR
These bitches be out to get you
These niggas be out to get you
Homie I don't give a fuck who they are
It might be your brother It might be your uncle
Might be the same bitch you been laying the pipe in
Fuck around and testified in the same courtroom that the prosecutor giving you life in
You shaking your head
Early in the morning got you making your bed
Like you ain't even a grown up
Got you thinking to your self I would have still been free
If a nigga would have did it on my own, huh
Now the only thing you can think about is if you ever see the free world
Hit him with the chrome huh open up they dome huh

(Never let the left hand know what the right hand doing

One deep for life)

[Chorus]
I don't trust nary one of these niggas, not one of these bitches

I don't trust nary one of these niggas, not one of these bitches (nary one of these bitches)
