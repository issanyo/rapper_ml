[Intro: Z-Ro]
Man it's just weed man, you trippin'
Man I already gave you my license and insurance man
You trippin' man

[Verse 1: Z-Ro]
Have you ever been arrested just for being too clean
On a Sunday night
They'll take you're car, take you to jail
Won't have a bond until Monday night
Man they just took 13 thousand dollars outta my pocket
Talkin' bout it's drug related, cause I had a cigarillo
They need to stop it
Since Barack Obama became the first black president
Tha police have been waging war against the black residents
Racial profiling is at an all time high
We represent 10% of the population but 65% of the jail population
And I can't tell you why (why), yeah
A lot of us are guilty as charged, and as much as I hate to say it
Some brothas deserve to be behind bars
You know the ones that beat on women
And the murderers and the rapists
And especially the ones that kidnap and even abandon babies
I promise all I was doing was leaving the Waffle House
They shined they lights on me and they saw the steak and waffles in my mouth
They pulled me over, took my money, and gave the King a weed case
And I'm STILL tryna get my money back from the state

[Hook: Z-Ro]
I can't even ride down the street
Without being harassed by tha police
Ain't botherin' nobody so why y'all fuckin' with a G
So what I got a lil' drank and a lil' weed
I'm Screwed Up Click, officer we don't speed
I'm on swangers but in and out the lane I don't weave
So what's yo probable cause for handcuffing me
It's just a dollar to you laws, to take us away from our family

[Verse 2: Chris Ward]
What the fuck
Damn, yeah yeah
The popo see young Wowo holdin' and lookin' good
I'm from Yellowstone, so my car is yellow tone and I'm lookin' hood
Ground effects, black and gold Vogues and '4s, I'm lookin' sporty
I heard HPD got an APB out and they lookin' for me
Well guess what
Every curve I swerve I'm known for hittin' the blinker bitch
All around the town, back and forth, here and there
On some frequent shit
I know you upset cause the paint so wet
You think it's leakin' bitch
So you pull me over and detain me on some juvenile delinquent shit
Like I don't know my rights from wrong, we ain't right your wrong
So what, you're whoop whoopin' and your bright lights is on
Because it's gone, all the smokes been smoked and the dranks been drunk
And here's my license and insurance
You faulty blue suit punk
Now what the funk you really want, fuckin' with me
Cause it's obvious I'm C dot dub, a motherfuckin' G
He had the gall to ask me for some posters and some CDs
Said if I sign 'em he'll give me a ticket and let me leave
Ain't that a BITCH

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Z-Ro]
I'm from the Screwed Up Click officer we don't speed
And since we ain't going to or comin' back from
We ain't got no mo' weed
Oh I was weavin' in and out my lane, huh?
Z-Ro was drivin' recklessly
Does all this candy paint and this chrome have you upset with me
It's only a 300 man it ain't like it's a Jag
Just because you can't afford none of them ain't a reason to get mad
My insurance good, it ain't nothin' wrong with none of my tags
Really you just fuckin' wit' me cause you got that gun and that badge
You ain't have no probable cause to pull me over anyway
Cause I wasn't doin' nothin', you just tryna reach a quota for the day
Now a days, innocence is overrated, everybody did it
Guilty until proven guilty, why, cause jail is big business
The penitentiary get paid to clothe us and feed us
Without us they go broke, we get convicted cause they need us
But I believe in Jesus, the one true judge
And he ain't gon' let you do nothin' he don't want you to do judge

[Hook]
