[Chorus]
Hoping my thug motherfuckers know
This be the realest shit I never wrote
Up in my studio getting blowed
To the illest shit I ever spoke
Hoping my thug motherfuckers know
This be the realest shit I never wrote
Up in my studio getting blowed
To the illest shit I ever spoke

[Verse 1]
They say I'm the 2Pac of Texas
And you ain't got to like it but I bet you gon' respect it
I really be one deep it ain't just hanging off my necklace
I need to take a shit but my schedule be so hectic
Them people trying to send me up the road again
They don't want to see me drive my Bentley up the road again
Racist motherfuckers when i go to court they show me them
They know i'm innocent but they don't give a fuck Z-Ro won't win
And then they wonder why my attitude the way it is
I'm rich but they still think I'ma rob 'em that's just the way it is
Leave church on a Sunday they don't give a fuck what day it is
In front of me and behind me I can tell what type of day this is
It's a shame I got to walk around with bond money
I ain't got a receipt though the crooked cop gon' take some from me
He say he smell that loud I told him find it and let me know
I smelled it too but he couldn't find it and had to let me go

[Chorus]
Hoping my thug motherfuckers know
This be the realest shit I never wrote
Up in my studio getting blowed
To the illest shit I ever spoke
Hoping my thug motherfuckers know
This be the realest shit I never wrote
Up in my studio getting blowed
To the illest shit I ever spoke

[Verse 2]
21 gun salute
Dressed in black gators and an Italian cut suit
When the camera start flashing I disappear into the crowd like Poof
These little rappers round town think they live like me
Hope they survive and they get to see 39 like me
Even gotta hustle in your sleep to be on your grind like me
Turn into sunlight dipped in chrome, is how you shine like me
They living fantasies, nigga but this the real-world here
Where all the grown women at? Ain't nothing but little girls here
These reality shows got all these hoes acting like thots
And Facebook is the brand new bible that's why relationships flop
And instead of breaking up a fight, we record it and holler "WorldStar!"
Could have saved a life instead another death on WorldStar
If Martin Luther King came back I wonder what he would say
Cops kill us, we riot, When we kill each other, it's okay
We need to get our priorities in line, or be a grandparent
Before you realize we was running out of time the whole time

[Chorus]
Hoping my thug motherfuckers know
This be the realest shit I never wrote
Up in my studio getting blowed
To the illest shit I ever spoke
Hoping my thug motherfuckers know
This be the realest shit I never wrote
Up in my studio getting blowed
To the illest shit I ever spoke
