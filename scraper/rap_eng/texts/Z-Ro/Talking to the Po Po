I heard you’ve been talking to the Po Po
Since we got secrets that’s a no no
Bitch I kill ya if I find out
You’ve been talking to the Po Po
Get yo head hit
You gone come up missing, I bet I'm not gone end up in  prison no mo (yeah)
I heard

[Verse 1: Z-RO]
I’m not a criminal just trying to pay my child support
If I can’t pay it I can only see my child in court
So I stopped drinkin’ started selling that drank by the quart
It didn’t matter who made the sale cuz what was mine was yours
So what? I sold a couple mo bottles, OK, I sold mo' cases
You act like it don’t bother you but its written all over your face when
You pull out yo money clip--
I pull out my money bag....
Nothing ass bitches be like, "Where the rest of yo money at?"
Sold work to an undercover? You gotta make a decision
So soft you might die in the county, won't even make it to prison
Now I got an echo on my cellular device...
Moved out of Houston, gettin' another cellular tonight

[Verse 2: Z-RO]
Tax straight, license insurance straight--
Everything’s straight; got a kilo in this bitch, other than that..?
Everything’s great
Put it in the stash spot, get it out the stash spot; it’s in the same shape
But I keep on seeing the same Caprice: same color, same plate
Call my connect and say my car won’t start
Soon as I find out who did it, that’s when the war gon' start
They say your brother said this and your brother said that...
I ain’t got a brother, go tell him his brother said that
I try my best to stay out the way, you fellas don’t ever see me
Why the fuck you fellas  got a problem every time you see me?
When I defend myself and squeeze...
Get away clean but somebody gone tell them it was me....
I heard
