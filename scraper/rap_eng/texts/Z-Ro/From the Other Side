[Verse 1]
Look
If you don't listen then how can you learn?
My bad I was just trying to show you how to really earn
Always speaking when it ain't your turn
So  when you really need some help nobody ain't concerned
If you already know the answer why you ask me?
Cause when I tell you the truth you gon' wanna blast me
Forgive me for keeping it real
And even though you don't like it that's how I'm keeping it still
Success is the enemy of laziness
No more deposits, a line of credit what they pay me with
I don't mind coaching but ain't gonna babysit
Money round the corner you standing still that's some crazy shit
I sure hate it but I'ma wish you the best
You ain't got to act like that, just remember you're blessed
Always talking at, instead of talking to
Then they wonder why I'm by myself when I be walking through

[Chorus]
Here's an invitation from the other side
We're just trying to live a better life
I see the suffering in your eyes
I don't know about you but I gotta survive

[Verse 2]
Just because you always with me don't mean you with me though
You only need five but you trying to get me for fifty though
I'm like "Damn my nigga what you need fifty for?"
If I say no, you'll be at my crib, trying to kick the door
Take notes, take a look at what I'm doing here
Yeah you see me pushing this foreign, but I see you in here
Look at all these empty rooms I see you moving here
I'm just trying to tell you something good I'm hoping you can hear
Slow it down my nigga, you always rushing
When you shaking my hand you don't realize what you're touching
You got a bad bitch but you only concerned with fucking
You gon' always need a key to start, you'll never push a button
Turning nothing into something is the only option
I'm off the showroom floor I don't go to auctions
Maybe some of what I'm doing you can do it too
I'm the plug, I'm the middle man, I'm who you do it through

[Chorus]
Here's an invitation from the other side
We're just trying to live a better life
I see the suffering in your eyes
I don't know about you but I gotta survive

[Verse 3]
Z-Ro you need to get your shit together bro
I know it's fucked up but it's gon' be like that forever though
She ain't gon' do right by you, you just need to let her go
He won't read the signs even though you made all the letters glow
My nigga I ain't trying to get you mad
But bitch you know what it is, hustle, get a bigger bag
Don't nobody give a fuck about you
Let them tough it out and you gon' have to tough it out too
Why should they get what they want from me if I can't get mine
It been like that all my life bet it ain't gon' happen this time
Look I know you tired of being a blessing
Doing good and never getting good, thats whats got you stressing
And if you ask me, I am just another nigga man
But just the other day JJ Watt tweeted a nigga name
'Ro you need to learn how to love yourself
Leave them pills alone, realize you a drug yourself

[Chorus]
Here's an invitation from the other side
We're just trying to live a better life
I see the suffering in your eyes
I don't know about you but I gotta survive
