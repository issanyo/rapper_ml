(Chorus - C-Mo)
If you lookin for me, I'll be grindin'
I got money on my mind at all times and'
While you sittin at home reclinin'I'm grindin'
Ay, Ay I grind - I grind...I grind, I grind
I grind, I grind - if you lookin for me I'll be grindin'

[Verse 1 - Big Moe]
Motorola big face folder
Bump and grindin just to get it
3rd Ward Texas block I bled it
To rescore that's where I'm headed
The streets is watchin - I'm not stoppin'
Cause my bills gon'keep on stackin
Or it's the love for singin and rappin
I love the game but I wanna know where is my change?
So close to ballin, I'm not stallin
I wreck on everybody's chorus
Take the stage these girls adore us
Plenty of fetti, to divide our monies
The Shop is wreckin, count your blessings
If your plexin'you'll be leavin
Another families been left grievin
Think you better ride out....

[Chorus - C-Mo]
If you lookin for me, I'll be grindin'
I got money on my mind at all times and'
While you sittin at home reclinin'I'm grindin'
Ay, Ay I grind - I grind...I grind, I grind
I grind, I grind - if you lookin for me I'll be grindin'

[Verse 2 - Z Ro + Big Moe]
Big Moe reloaded, drankin - smokin'
The Screwed Up Clan was put together
Let's wreck the streets, and the storm will weather
A platinum plaques gonna make ya feel better
So much money, so much money
It feels so good, gettin paid Ay, Ay
So much money, so much money
Try to mess over me you'll get sprayed
So much money, so much money
You don't really wanna fool around
So much money, so much money
I can pay to put you six feet underground - Yeah

[Chorus - C-Mo]
If you lookin for me, I'll be grindin'
I got money on my mind at all times and'
While you sittin at home reclinin'I'm grindin'
Ay, Ay I grind - I grind...I grind, I grind
I grind, I grind - if you lookin for me I'll be grindin'

[Verse 3 - Big Moe]
We not just local, world wide vocal
Tryin hard to make it gravy
Customized, have you seen me lately
Around these parts they call me drank baby
Said I'll O.D.they don't know me
Big Moe still smokin and leanin'
Constantly hustlin'jugglin cream and
Livin my life as if I'm dreamin'

[Verse 4 - Z-Ro + Big Moe]
Please don't wake me, please don't wake me
Lord please let me sleep up in your palm
Far from reality, laws might break me
In a small world or can I ball?
Yeah, anything I won't fresh off the lot
It's yours Big Moe just sign by the dot
Pullin'out to get my screens installed
Dedicated to the game, I'm a shot call

[Chorus Till The End]
