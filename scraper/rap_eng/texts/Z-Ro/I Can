[Verse 1: Z-Ro]
I used to have diamonds on the top row
But now I'm pearly whites across the top hoe
And I'm feeling so good so good so good
Smoking reggie around me you can not know
If it ain't that kush you need to stop bro
You know I keep it so hood so hood so hood
Guess its up to me to bring real rap back
Keep it in my waist I ain't never needed a backpack
Fuck going to chow I had a locker full of ?[jack mac]?
Put the money on my books cause Pimp C brought me ?[that sack]?

[Hook: Z-Ro]
I Got a pocket full of money
And a half ounce of that good
My neighbors white
But I act like I still live in the hood
They say I shouldn't ball so much
But I feel like I should
You dont work, you dont eat
Thats understood
I Show off cause I can
I can I can I can I can I can I can
I show off cause I can
I can I can I can I can I can I can

[Chorus: Mike D]
Hit a lick cause I can
Hundred bricks in my hand
Fuck ya bitch in the 6 on the sand
Cause I can
See the chopper bout to land cause I can
Ya Understand
Hundred grand in my hand
I'm the man ya understand

[Verse 2: Z-Ro]
I'm the man in this bitch

I am so high I will never land in this bitch
No reason at all brought a hundred grand in this bitch
Ask me why i did it bitch cause I can in this bitch
Bad bitch and a bad bitch laying in this bitch
Give a fuck if the police ever ran in this bitch
No arrest warrent on me I made plans in this bitch
Wall the wall nowhere to sit or stand in this bitch
It ain't a club but you can get lap dance in this bitch
Sniper rifle on me dont need my [?] in this bitch
I dont wanna be the reason we need ambulance in this bitch

[Hook: Z-Ro]
I Got a pocket full of money
And a half ounce of that good
My neighbors white
But I act like I still live in the hood
They say I shouldn't ball so much
But I feel like I should
You dont work, you dont eat
Thats understood
I Show off cause I can
I can I can I can I can I can I can
I show off cause I can
I can I can I can I can I can I can I can

[Chorus: Mike D]
Hit a lick cause I can
Hundred bricks in my hand
Fuck ya bitch in the 6 on the sand
Cause I can
See that chopper bout to land cause I can

Hundred grand in my hand
I'm the man ya understand

[Verse 3: Z-Ro]
Who say I dont run this city nigga please
Cause you dont see me where them other pussy niggas be
I won't walk in until them other pussy niggas leave
Cause soon as I sit down
All of they bitches gon' come sit with me
Rother Vandross can I get a picture
And when you leave
Can a real bitch roll with ya
Hell yeah if she a dime
But I ain't fucking with the thots
Its a hundred fucking degrees
So I ain't fucking with the top
I'm rolling air conditioning
Big old pad I'm living in
In real life, the closet for my pants
It is a den
Bitches used to laugh at me
But they ain't laughing now though
I used to be like "How ya doing?"
Now I be like "Hi hoe"

[Hook: Z-Ro]
I Got a pocket full of money
And a half ounce of that good
My neighbors white
But I act like I still live in the hood
They say I shouldn't ball so much
But I feel like I should
You dont work, you dont eat
Thats understood
I Show off cause I can
I can I can I can I can I can I can
I show off cause I can
I can I can I can I can I can I can I can

[Chorus: Mike D]
Hit a lick cause I can
Hundred bricks in my hand
Fuck ya bitch in the 6 on the sand
Cause I can
See that chopper biut to land cause I can
Ya Understand
Hundred grand in my hand
I'm the man ya understand huh
