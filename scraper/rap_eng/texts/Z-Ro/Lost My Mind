[Verse 1]
My bitch say she love me
But I don't think it's just me
But I don't really give a fuck
As long as I'm living I'ma live it up
I ain't trying to take no pictures, give a fuck how they feel
I ain't no model faced nigga, I'ma keep it real
How y'all doing, but fuck all y'all
Don't walk up on me too quick cause I don't trust all y'all
I just want my money, either you buying or you leaving
Make me slap the shit out of somebody this evening
My ADHD won't stop, I really wish it would
All I got to say I really wish one of you bitches would

[Chorus]
I done lost my mind, I'm trying to find my shit
100,000 worth of powder, wanna buy my shit
Sometimes I'm cool, sometimes I'm not
You might get a handshake or you might get shot
I done lost my mind, I'm trying to find my shit
100,000 worth of powder, you should buy my shit
But I don't give a fuck what none of y'all say
I'm doing it the Joseph McVey way

[Verse 2]
Therazine, Wellbutrin, and Prozac
That's the reason Z-Ro act the way Z-Ro act
And I say Doc this dose is too strong, so can you change mine
Cause I be frowning, I be laughing at the same time
Maybe I'm crazy, I be talking to myself on the daily
Like what the fuck we bout to do, get high 'Ro
Nah, maybe later, nah nigga, right now 'Ro
Mean case of road rage and a nice ride
Rolling with my bestie ain't nobody on my right side
When I die, my daughter's gon' split my cash
And tell all of my baby momma's they can kiss my ass

[Chorus]
I done lost my mind, I'm trying to find my shit
100,000 worth of powder, wanna buy my shit
Sometimes I'm cool, sometimes I'm not
You might get a handshake or you might get shot
I done lost my mind, I'm trying to find my shit
100,000 worth of powder, you should buy my shit
But I don't give a fuck what none of y'all say
I'm doing it the Joseph McVey way

[Verse 3]
Half a pound of extra extra loud, I'ma smoke it all
I ain't passing shit, ain't none of y'all can smoke at all
And if you mad, nigga say something
Matter of fact, if you mad, try to take something
I really wish a nigga would
You know I'm from the wish a nigga woods (Mo-City Texas)
Cause it ain't shit for me to catch a case
Riding through Atlanta Georgia with some Texas plates
