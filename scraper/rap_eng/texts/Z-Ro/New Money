[Intro]
(Fuck it up!)
Wow

[Verse 1]
If I got this and I got that, then I got it all (Then I got it all)
I ain't worried 'bout what the price tag say, not at all (Nigga, not at all)
When a hater run up (Hater run up), you know I'ma catch a body y'all (Catch a body y'all)
Never giving a fuck (Gangsta), you know I'd never lie to y'all (Aha)
They say "Ro ain't this and Ro ain't that," but Ro be gettin' money, Yeah they think I'm uneducated, I'm a millionaire, so tell me am I a dummy?
No limit to what I would do for my children, gotta keep food in they tummy
Don't make me murder one of you motherfuckers thinkin' you gon' run up on me and try to take somethin' from me
I ain't gonna do it, I'ma pay to have ya took out like the trash motherfucker, like the last motherfucka
You know I'm playin', I'ma do it by myself, there go your head, there go your chest, there go your cash motherfucka
The mentality of somebody with a check is what ya dealin' wit', grown man, I ain't never fuckin' wit' that silly shit
Remember when I was broke, couldn't get you to say "hello," now you wanna be under me 'cause I got dividends, ol' nigga on the loose bitch

[Chorus]
Ol' nigga on the loose with that new money
Young nigga on the loose with a buncha new money
Bad bitch on the loose with a buncha new money
I'm the boss, that mean I tell them nigga what to do for me
I was born with nothin' so I gotta die with everything
See I was down so long, look how to the good Lord bless me mane
I'ma ball outta control until these haters come get me mane
I'ma ball outta control until these haters come get me mane
New money

[Verse 2]
Let's see if I could still do it like a young nigga, fuck wit' me, ya better have ya gun wit' ya
So light ya scared, talkin' 'bout all my people that done hung wit' ya, get rid of you and whoever come wit' ya
Yeah, I'm a rich nigga bitch, I got some playful ass killas that will entertain you, have some fun wit' ya
My nigga, I'm sendin' every type of bullet they ever made your way and when I send 'em at every one hit ya
Hundred grand in the front seat and one in the back, don't mind me, I'm just havin' fun with a band
Don't mind me, I'm just havin' flashbacks of when I had to sleep in the park, I'm havin' fun with a band
And every time I spend a hundred grand and my bitches sayin' they ain't never gon' be shit, I'm havin' fun with a band
Gimme all these, and all these, and all these too, don't give a fuck what size, I'm havin' fun with a band
And even though I fought that case, ya know a nigga could've bought that case, don't really give a fuck about that case
I kept my money in my pocket, didn't touch it, had God wit' me, so there ain't no way I could've lost that case
I got fronted a hundred thousand dollars, it was s'posed to be mo' than that, the nigga wasn't trippin' though
Middle man ass made me put a hit on you, they pull up wit' the spitta, spit on you, ya drippin' hoe, bitch I'm on the loose

[Chorus]
Ol' nigga on the loose with that new money
Young nigga on the loose with a buncha new money
Bad bitch on the loose with a buncha new money
I'm the boss, that mean I tell them nigga what to do for me
I was born with nothin' so I gotta die with everything
See I was down so long, look how to the good Lord bless me mane
I'ma ball outta control until these haters come get me mane
I'ma ball outta control until these haters come get me mane
New money
