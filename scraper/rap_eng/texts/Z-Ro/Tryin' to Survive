Ooooooh, yeeeeeeeah
Yeeeeah-ay, ooooh yeah

[Hook: Isis Re]
I don't know, how I can survive
In these streets, hard to be me
I can surviiiive

[Ronnie Spencer]
And I don't know how long, I can survive
Living in these streets
Puffing on these sweets, keeps me alive
And I don't know how long, I can hold on
When I look into the sky, see the birds fly
Keeps me holding on
And I don't know what to do
This life is taking me, through my up's and down's
And I can't get off this ride, holding on so tight
I just close my eyes (close my eyes)

I had to keep from going under, like Stevie I wonder thinking hard
Running out of places to lay my head, got me drinking hard
Born struggling, a fellow achieved his bubbling
The fact that I can't get no job, don't do nothing but rub it in
I'm running out of time, and I'm sick of slanging nickels and dimes
Ducking the police daily, is affecting my grind
Losing my mind behind the wrong woman, that say she loves me
Long as I'm dropping on the rent, everything is lovely
So many features in songs, tell me why I ain't got no home
Penitentiary grown cause I roam, with a pocket full of stones
Somebody tell me, will I make it to the cream of the crop
Forever stressed, so I be screaming a lot
Dog at twenty years old, I use to know that I'd be reaching 25
Now 24 and still no do', my job is struggle and strive
I keep my heat up under my seat, when I creep
Cause I just met Mr. Sweets, but now he under my feet
Man it's a cold cold world, that we living in
Killas'll take your life, and it ain't gotta be about no divid-ends
Forgive me for my sins, I'm just trying to make it
Trying to keep my pistol from my head, cause I just can't take it
Jesus, I'm trying to survive

[Ronnie Spencer]
And I don't know what to do
This life is taking me, through my up's and down's
And I can't get off this ride, holding on so tight
I just close my eyes (close my eyes)
