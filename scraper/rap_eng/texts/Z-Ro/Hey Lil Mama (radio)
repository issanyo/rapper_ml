Hey there Lil' Mama
Why don't you come & take a ride with me around the town?
On the low, we could be goin' down baby
Hey there Lil' Mama
Why don't you come & take a ride with me?
We can smoke us a pound
Hit the Telly & we can & gon' clown baby

[Z-Ro:]
Well uh excuse me miss, I don't wanna take up your time
And this ain't none of that kitty game with the same old pick up line
I'm a get straight to the point, you are as lovely as a rose
Though I'm not into one night stands, I'm eager to see you out your clothes
Please don't take it the wrong way, I'm just spectatin'
But I won't lie & say I'm not thinkin' about sex makin'
It was on my mind real strong, but I don't wanna rush
We can remain friends for a real long time
By then I'd know if I've been dealin' with a strong mind
Either business brain the drugged up & gone mind
But that's irrelevant, I'm speakin' for the present baby
Tell your girls you gon' holla, jump in my Intrepid baby
Unless they wanna come & kick it with my homies
If not, me & you could kick it & leave 'em all lonely
I got alot of girls on my phone tryin' to lay with me
But just for tonight, I want yourself to come & stay with me

Papa was a rollin' stone & he still rollin'
I guess that's why I leave alot of pussy holes swollen
I must've got it from my Dad, this mackin' in me
Plus all the girls love this big dick I'm packin' with me
Don't get me wrong, I'm not a hit & run
Anytime you make time for me, then you can come & sit & give me some
Tryin' to handcuff me, you movin' too quick
Not tryin' to be seen in public with you at the movies & shit
Chances are you got a man, he gon' be mad if he see you
So let's keep our thing undercover, so nobody know what we do
Long as we do it like that, we can do it long
Make it a while since we did it last so we do it strong
It's in my blood to be as straight up as I can be
And straight up I can see you in my jacuzzi chillin' with me
Though I got alot of girls on my phone tryin' to lay with me
Just for tonight, I want yourself to come & stay with me

I feel my cellphone vibrate & I wonder who could it be?
Another bad ass yellow bone talkin' dirty to me
She say she ready for me to come & make my round
Tellin' me how she gon' do me, I'm ready to break right now
As soon as I got in my ride 'fore I made it out the driveway
The twins hit my celly, said that they were comin' my way
Double the pleasure double the fun, I can't miss that
A menage with the Asian persuasion, I had to hit that
Makin' money all day long is what I love
But I'm tryin' to give up a minute or 2 so you can fuck a thug
And I won't waste your time, not a minute man
Layin' pipe with long jevity, always I'll be in it man
And once I reach my conclusion, that ain't the end
I'm just givin' you a breather, baby go on & catch a wind
Maybe that's the reason all these girls wanna lay with me
I'll show you if you want me to, just spend the night & play with me
