[Verse 1]
Uhhhh, you get what you pay fo'
Ain't no customer service, because I say so
These ain't yours my nigga, these here weigh mo'
Hard for the nigga spending the money, that's who they fo'
And I ain't even talking bout dope
If they ain't talking bout money, then I'm talking bout no
Walking fast spaz out, and then I'm walking out slow
Leave a witness, so my enemies can talk about Ro
I don't need to do a song with nobody, I do my own thang
Y'all getting off at the same exit, I'm in my own lane
I ain't gotta go get the Crips, I am my own gang
Another 75 thousand, every time the phone rang
Phone never off, it's always on mayn
Nigga want a hook and a verse, that's twenty zones mayn
I hope, Young Jeezy don't mind
Had to make a hook, out of one of his famous punch lines

[Chorus - 2x]
It's taking too long to lock up, bring it back
You were short anyway, so bring a stack
Bring a stack, bring a stack, bring a stack, bring a stack
Bring a stack, bring a stack, bring-a bring-a bring a stack

[Verse 2]
It's taking too long to lock up, bring it back
I'm the father, of these rapping and singing cats
Sound like they moaning, show me where they singing at
They trash, I'm not thinking bout thinking bout taking it back
Drankin' & Drivin' and Legendary, they banging that
I go hard if not harder, than all these other famous acts
Ro that ain't english he speaking, but that's they favorite track
No wonder our kids go crazy, they be everyday with that
But if you need that real shit, I can hook it up
You thought my cd like it was a bag of coke, and shook it up
You should see me in the kitchen, when I cook it up
I use nothing but real ingredients, I never whoop it up
Last thing I heard, I was the man on these streets
Bitch you gotta pay me ten percent, to stand on these streets
I hope, Young Jeezy don't mind
Had to make a hook, out of one of his famous punch lines

[Chorus - 2x]
It's taking too long to lock up, bring it back
You were short anyway, so bring a stack
Bring a stack, bring a stack, bring a stack, bring a stack
Bring a stack, bring a stack, bring-a bring-a bring a stack

[Verse 3]
Listen, it's a lot of people stuck on my old shit
Me I'm on that moving right along, I gotta grow shit
20 years later, they still on that broke shit
Me I want the world, and I'm having it homie no shit
Fish scale ass rappers, can't get our people high
They just want money, they don't give a fuck if our people die
I know we lazy, I'm just trying to make our people try
They thank God for me, but they look at me with a evil eye
Lord forgive em, for they know not what they do
The haters be like man we don't be hating, but they do
I do my own thang, I don't give a fuck what they do
I can't save em all, I gotta just let em do what they do
I don't fuck with the police like that, I'm just trying to do some right
So when they pull you over, they won't murder you tonight
I hope, Young Jeezy don't mind
Had to make a hook, out of one of his famous punch lines

[Chorus - 2x]
It's taking too long to lock up, bring it back
You were short anyway, so bring a stack
Bring a stack, bring a stack, bring a stack, bring a stack
Bring a stack, bring a stack, bring-a bring-a bring a stack

(*talking*)
Z-Ro, King of the motherfucking Ghetto
Yeah nigga, in there like swim wear without the chin hair
What you worried about what type of tip I'm leaving
For the waitress fo' nigga, get your mind on your money
And get it off of mine, ya dig
Cause I'm in rare form like a bear palm, with a spare arm
One Deep Entertainment, chuuch
