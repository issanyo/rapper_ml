Shirt off at the Kappa, (trousers on)
Dirty Third, Dirty Third

[Z-Ro]
24/7 and around the clock
I'ma keep my fingas around the Glock
When I bust I'll be damned if I miss
Ain't a goddamn body that's gonna get around the shot
I'm the 007 of the Ridgemont 4
With W double O D, E N J O L I, we come so fly
Don't get it twisted I swell up eyes and I swell up jaws
And I split eyebrows, and I really don't give a damn
When a nigga pull the trick up outta my sleeve
I'm introduce you to the pistol pad
But when I finger that hoe, and when she come it hurt
Whatever take yourself, or the blood gon squirt
Give me my money for shots disburse
When I lit my shots, I clear the concerts
Jay-Jay and the Den-Den, we gon make a mill in the end then
Going overseas, in the Girbauds and fresh benefits
Decked out to Europe in outfits, steady stacking chips
Slanging birds, with a pen and beat the shit out these verbs
Vocabulary spit nothing but words
Drop mo' songs, than a bird do turds
We runnin Excursions, no more 'Burbans, in the biggest SUV
Screwed Up Click is my family name, abbreviated like S.U.C
Cause in the Dirty Third, niggas put prices up on our heads
Cause our cars, be running and haunting
Bitches move weight, like Jenny Craig

[Hook - 2x]
Its the Dirty Third, slanging birds stacking chips
Quick to pull a strap, empty clips if you trip
Its the Dirty Third, slanging birds stacking chips
We killas with pistol grip, steady letting our rugas rip

[Wood]
We ain't burning the home grown
The Dirty Third where I roam
Slanging birds flipping zones, sipping syrup out our styrofoams
Quick to pull a strap empty clips, if you trip
We killas with pistol grip, steady letting our rugas rip
At the peak of my game against the grain, & I'm leaving a stain
Piece and chain its bezeltaine, bracelets watch and pinky rings
Twenty inches a roll, players throwed to pull hoes
Serve drank by the four, blowing bud in studios
Its paying me fetty and cheese, triple beams and dolja green
Chop on blades and swang on threes, SUV's and Humvees
The W double O-D, Z-Ro and Enjoli
He said it once befo', look at what you done to me
Thought it was over but it ain't, I separate the real and the fake
You sugar coated bustas, you put the filling in the cake
I'm still balling while moving J-A-T's, SKA no AMG's
In the Dirty Third we shipping ki's and, platinum c.d.'s nigga

[Hook - 2x]

[Enjoli]
Middle finger to you hoes, and all my foes
I done squashed the plex so what's next, I rose
From the bottom to the top, Third Coast won't stop
Southsil for lil, when trunks knocking tops drop
And the G's body rock, I ride to these
Looking good gripping wood, with a ounce of the tweed
Having fun in the sun, making money by the tons
Stacking papas pulling capas, staying sharp for the evil ones
So lay it down 'fore the sparks fly
S.U.C. full of moves, niggas we on the rise
Hopping outta wide bodies, and it don't stop
Enjoli be the queen, and you bout's to ride (say what)
It be so lovely it be so nice, being twice
Stay blinding you hoes, six figgas and reunite
Moving state to state, pushing albums like weight
Better regulate, and still screeeeaming

[Hook - 3x]
