Z-Ro

[Verse 1: Z-Ro]
My face real heavy, your face real light
I'm smokin kush, that shit you smoke ain't even top flight
Now that ain't even right
Me myself I smoke that bomb brah
If I can't find it in the US I'm flyin' to The Bahamas
I've popped so many Lorcets, popped so many Somas
And popped so many Vicodins I don't need marijuana
If this was the 70s I would be known as a stoner
I would drink by myself, and I smoke by myself because I am a loner
But I don't snort cocaine, I don't huff no paint
But I'm a codeine proffesor I know everything about drank
I barely can keep my balance, I need something to lean on
I'm in the club but I will go to sleep on
The wall, if I feel like I can't take it
Y'all fellas be trippin', smokin' that wet and then y'all get naked
As Z-Ro gon' keep his clothes on, keep that codeine bubblin'
I know it look like I'm mad but I promise I'm not mean muggin'
My..

[Hook: Z-Ro]
Face real heavy, attitude groove
Higher than a bitch, I don't want you to blow my mood
Face real heavy, y'all know what I mean
I like my women but I'm in love with that Codeine
Face real heavy, y'all know how it goes
We sippin' on a pint don't give a fuck about a foe
Face real heavy (face real heavy, face, face real heavy)
Face real heavy (face real heavy, face, face real heavy)

[Verse 2: B.G.]
My legs feels weak, my face real heavy
I'm swervin' up the block, try'na keep the world steady
This rolls the seven and pop seven pills
Got a pint on deck and I'm 'bout crank the seal
I'mma keep it real, I'mma keep it gudda
Gizzle be higher than 'bout ten muthafuckas
Feel I can touch the moon cause I'm so far in the sky
I'll bust a nigga head if they blow this good high
I done did it all, you already read the magazine
It was heroin and coke and I was using promethazine
I pop a lot a 'cets, I pop a lot of Somas
Blown over power by that shit from California
I get a lot of love, I got a lot of plugs
Me and Ro together we a drank a whole jug
Don't get it twisted, that 40 stay ready
I got a lof of fetti, and my face real heavy

[Hook: Z-Ro]

[Verse 3: Z-Ro]
My face so heavy my neck and back hurtin' bad
If this nigga blow my high that'll make me wanna murk his ass
Y'all be on cloud 9 I'm on cloud 76
See I lost it
And I'm still lookin' for my breath in this bitch (what?)
I just hit the bong, guess I hit it too long
Cause I can't stop coughing and choking
That Chocolate Thai too strong
Roll up some Bubba Kush, I buy some Sour Diesel
I bet I'll blow 7 cigarrilos every hour, people
Haha

[Verse 4: B.G.]
And everyday is the same sequel
I be higher than a kite, call me Gizzle the eagle
I be higher than a plane, call me call me Gizzle the Boeing
Man I'm feelin' so good, I don't care where I'm going
My face heavy right now, but I'mma keep flowin'
We got 2 dozens of gauge and we gon' keep blowin'
I'mma stay on my level, man I'mma stay straight-raight
Man my face feel like a fifty pound weight
Yeeaah

[Hook: Z-Ro]
