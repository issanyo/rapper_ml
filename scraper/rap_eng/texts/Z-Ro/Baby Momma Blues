[Verse 1]
Bitch, bitch, you can’t have none of me
The same ungrateful ass bitch is what you’re gonna be
I really wish my daughter knew what was going on
Cause she don’t want my company she want my cash
And I know her mother is to blame
Filling her brain with these fucking lies about me
Probably got her thinking I want her to live a life without me
And I hate you bitch and I hope whatever you ate today makes you sick
Why you always gotta be hating on me
I’m good cause ain’t nothing but blessings waiting on me

[Hook]
Baby mama talking that shit
Don’t want me to see my kid
I ain’t giving you no more dick
Cause I don’t love you
Do you know who you fucking with
I ain’t gonna ever love no bitch
Rather wife the ice around my wrist
Matter of fact fuck you

[Verse 2]
Fuckin with me I know you thought you was gonna get rich
And now you mad than a motherfucker cause you ain’t get shit
Your friends be like as long as he takes care of his kids
Whatever he do with his money bitch that ain’t your business
Trying to turn my child against me cause I don’t fuck with you
Saying shit like he don’t love us, nah just ain’t no love for you
Habitual thot is what is the problem here
If you ain’t gone grow up then please get the fuck out of here
I’m so tired of your pussy ass attitude
I could capture the sun and then give it to the bitch but the bitch wouldn’t show no gratitude
Only time I hear from you is when something needs to be paid for
That’s why I never come around your way hoe

[Hook]
Baby mama talking that shit
Don’t want me to see my kid
I ain’t giving you no more dick
Cause I don’t love you
Do you know who you fucking with
I ain’t gonna ever love no bitch
Rather wife the ice around my wrist
Matter of fact fuck you

[Verse 3]
Just because I don’t want to be at your house
You got me all up in the court house
Telling the judge my residence is just a hoe house
And you don’t want your child around me to see all these bad go in and go out
Hoping I miss a payment you really want them hoes to jail me
Just hate to see my happy you want to see my new relationship fail me
Programming hatred for daddy all in my child head
Cause I no longer want your ratchet ass in my bed
I don’t wanna die lonely but I promise Iw ill before I end up with a phony
You need to realize my child ain’t a hustle
That’s the reason I live the good life but you still live in the struggle
Young hoe
