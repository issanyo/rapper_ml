[Chorus]
Guerilla till I die, mama don't cry
When they come for me, if I blast
We gon see how many of em run from me
Guerilla till I die, but I never shed a tear
Cause they don't love a nigga here
Guerilla till I die, mama don't cry
When they come for me, if I blast
We gon see how many of em run from me
Guerilla till I die, but I never shed a tear
Cause they don't love a nigga here

[Verse 1: Z-Ro & Taz ]
American me
Could it be my own mob is out to murder me?
I'm ready to kill, and I'm ready to die
But have these cowards heard of me?
The rumors are real, better keep your Glock cocked
Leaving em stiffer than a statue
Ready to defend my guerilla maab by any means
And I'd murder if I have to
Heard my homie's working as an undercover
Ready to kiss my cheek, and earn your silver pieces
Could it be that I've seen my last supper?
Mighty Jahova, please protect my spirit from the danger
And I know you said you would strike down upon thee
With great vengeance and furious anger
Those who attempt to poison your brothers
Was it nothing but the word of God
That kept a nigga from taking the lives of so many others?
And I'm trying to keep my ways right, but every mother's day
I'm bawling around a gravesite, pud punk I hate you to death
But yet I loved you so, wanted you to feel my pain since '91
So brother come with me, and die slow
I hate you to death, but yet I loved you so
Wanted you to feel my pain since 91
So brother come with me, and die slow

[Chorus]
Guerilla till I die, mama don't cry
When they come for me, if I blast
We gon see how many of em run from me
Guerilla till I die, but I never shed a tear
Cause they don't love a nigga here
Guerilla till I die, mama don't cry
When they come for me, if I blast
We gon see how many of em run from me
Guerilla till I die, but I never shed a tear
Cause they don't love a nigga here

[Verse 2: Taz]
As my life flashes before my eyes
Visions of wicked ways, keep me puzzled
Wondering why I was introduced to a life
Filled with drama and trouble
And everyone's always got something to say
When I come around, when I clown
On the DL, smile in my face
And stab me in my back, when I turn around
And I can feel hateful eyes, watching plotting to get me
They underestimate me, and hate me
But never approach, cause they can't fade me
And I'll be damned if I go softly, shouldn't of crossed me
Guerilla till I die, and I'mma blast when they come for me
Please tell me is there a place, where my guerillas could seek refuge
'Cause it seems each time we gain one, that's one more we lose
Whatever the rules, whatever you choose, whatever you give, I accept
Just let me twist up one and smoke one for the world before my last breath
How can I go on, how can I take away my anguish
A permanent frown on my face, cause non-guerillas are strangers
And nobody knows my soul, so I show no fear
Mobbing till I die, cause they don't love a nigga here

[Chorus]
Guerilla till I die, mama don't cry
When they come for me, if I blast
We gon see how many of em run from me
Guerilla till I die, but I never shed a tear
Cause they don't love a nigga here
Guerilla till I die, mama don't cry
When they come for me, if I blast
We gon see how many of em run from me
Guerilla till I die, but I never shed a tear
Cause they don't love a nigga here

[Verse 3: Z-Ro]
Could it be I'm too good for hell?
Heaven don't want me, because I keep slippin'
Even though I do drugs I still preach to motherfuckers
About how to be Christians
I got a problem I suppose, but I know
I'm gon' solve it with a 4-4, ten sticks of fry
And about 25 Tylenol 4's
But they tell me to hold my head up and finish my tape
Because its gon jam
Do they really respect my music, or hang around Z-Ro just to meet Bam?
I really don't know, all I can say, that I don't trust not a man on this earth
Been that way, ever since my birth
And it's gonna stay that-a-away till I'm down in the dirt
Niggas, are raising up out of my business
Is something they better do, but I may hit the cut
With a pocket full of rocks, and I won't leave
Until I got rich, and who gotta put it down to the bullets
Dump a lot of bullets, till the job done
Till a nigga really wanna, kill myself
Nigga shut the fuck up, while my record is spinning
I'm really trying to feel myself
Gotta get em all, gotta get em dead
When I'm filling the bed, put the infrared to the head
Everybody come up dead, better roll on or get stole on
Nigga really better gone on, cause I just can't hold on
I'm ready to kill and I'm ready to die, with nuts of steel
Living on the motherfucking edge
Nigga don't run up, because its real
Nigga can you feel me

[Chorus]
Guerilla till I die, mama don't cry
When they come for me, if I blast
We gon see how many of em run from me
Guerilla till I die, but I never shed a tear
Cause they don't love a nigga here
Guerilla till I die, mama don't cry
When they come for me, if I blast
We gon see how many of em run from me
Guerilla till I die, but I never shed a tear
Cause they don't love a nigga here
Guerilla till I die, mama don't cry
When they come for me, if I blast
We gon see how many of em run from me
Guerilla till I die, but I never shed a tear
Cause they don't love a nigga here
Guerilla till I die, mama don't cry
When they come for me, if I blast
We gon see how many of em run from me
Guerilla till I die, but I never shed a tear
Cause they don't love a nigga here
