[Intro: Miguel & Chamillionaire]
Love you like a brother
Never be another
Treat you like a friend
Treat you like a friend
Respect you like a lover
Mmmmmmmmmmmmmm
Oooooo, ooooo, oooooo
(You can beat that never ever sweat that)
(You can beat that never ever sweat that)
(You can beat that never ever sweat that)
(You can beat that never ever sweat that)
Chamillitary mayne
Hmmmmmmm

[Hook: Chamillionaire]
Baby I bein stacking cash, off in this rubberband
I bein hustling in the streets all afternoon
Told her I'm a work the kitty soon
You just be patient till I get back to the room
If you just keep it wet, then I'm a show ya
That I'm the best, I work it till it; s over, no doubt
That I'm a boss, bout to tell the workers that the boss is getting off
Just tell me what ya want

[Verse 1: Chamillionaire]
How bout it your body is bout to be convinced
Hope you know how to swim tonight I'l prolly leave ya drenched
Hungry for money yea it's true I'm normally chewin chips
I think tonight il prolly add your body to the list
They say the girl that hate ya most is the one who ya miss
The woman that is normally ghost who got the truest kiss
Emptying pockets for your hotness giving you my tips
I'm bout to watch her getting topless tryan do the splits
Just let it drip I'm unclogging it with no draino
I had ya gushing and errupting like a volcano
Ya haven't sinned but I know that you ain't got no halo
Covers so sweaty it look like we making snow angels
So much stamina you'll think we having car sex
Test driver even let you see the car facts
Get up under then I proceed to give you oil checks
So much drive that when we done you leaking tyre tracks

[Verse 2: Miguel]
If you be the cash
I'll be the rubberband
You be the match
I'm a be your fuse
Boom!
Painter baby you
Could be the muse
I'm the reporter baby
You could be the news
Cause your the cigarette
And I'm the smoker
We raise a bet...
Cause you're tha joker
Truth tho...
You are the chalk
And I could be the blackboard
And you can be the talk
And I could be the walk

[Hook: Miguel]
Even when the sky comes falling
Even when the sun don't shine
I got faith in you and I
So put your pretty little hand in mine
Even when we're down to the wire babe
Even when it's do or die
We can do it baby simple and plain
Cause This Love Is a Sure Thing

[Bridge x4]
You could bet that
Never got to sweat that

[Verse 3: Z-Ro]
Well um excuse me miss I don't wanna take up ya time
But this ain't none of the kitty game
But the same old pick up line
I'm a get straight to the point
Your are as lovely as a rose
No I'm not into one night stands
I'm eager to see you out your clothes
Please don't take it the wrong way, I'm just spectating
But I won't lie and say I'm not thinking about sex making
It was on my mind real strong but I don't wanna rush
We can remain friends for a little more time
By then I'l know if I've bein dealin with a strong mind
If her buisness brain that drugged up and gone mine
But that's irrelavent I'm speaking for the present baby
Tell your girls you gone holler jump in my intriffic baby
Unless they wanna come and kick it with my homies
If not, me and you can kick it and leave em all lonely
I gotta lotta women on my phone trying ta lay with me
But just for the night I want yourself to come and stay with

[Bridge: Miguel]
Rock with me baby
Let me hold you in my arms
Talk with me baby
Rock with me baby
Let me hold you in my arms
Talk with me baby
This love
Between you and I
As simple as pie baby
Such a sure thing
Oh is it a sure thing

[Hook: Miguel]
Even when the sky comes fallin
Even when the sun don't shine
I got faith in you and I
So put your pretty little hand in mine
Even when we're down to the wire babe
Even when it's do or die
We can do it baby simple and plain
This love is a sure thing
Love you like a brother
Treat you like a friend
Respect you like a lover
Oooo, oooo, oooo
