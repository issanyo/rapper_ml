[Hook]
I know they don't give a fuck about me
I promise I'll be happy alone
Whether you see me on TV or these streets
My attitude is leave me the fuck alone
I know they don't give a fuck about me
I promise I'll be happy alone
Whether you see me on TV or these streets
I'm not a rapper homie I'm just a G

[Verse 1]
How the fuck can they love me
If they out there in the streets talking down mayne
How they fuck can they love me
If they look at my money like it's not mine
Homie I come from the street live my life by the rules
If I owe ya I'm gon' get ya might be ten years due
Guarantee it'll be a visit if you fuck with my food
Smile in my face and stab me in my back that's what busters do
Me I go it alone what they fuck is a crew
A bunch of people that want me to do what they want me to do
I don't take orders if anythang I'm a give them bitches
You must of thought by having my child you guaranteed to get riches, shit
I told you last album to go on 'head and file on me
Hate me so bad I know it hurt ya to see a smile on me
Bitch I'm a boss you trying to talk to me like I'm a trick
One hundred and twenty thousand a month, I guess I am that big

[Hook]
I know they don't give a fuck about me
I promise I'll be happy alone
Whether you see me on TV or these streets
My attitude is leave me the fuck alone
I know they don't give a fuck about me
I promise I'll be happy alone
Whether you see me on TV or these streets
I'm not a rapper homie I'm just a G

[Verse 2]
Trying to make it to heaven is hard as hell
They out to get me baby mamas, and my boys as well
They say they love me but do they love me it's hard to tell
They love his freedom but forget him when their boy's in jail
I was driving but the shit was where the passenger ride
So now-a-days it ain't nobody on my passenger side
Eating bullshit wearing white and passing the time
I swear it wasn't no cotton up in that mattress of mine
So use to mean mugging I swear I gotta practice to smile
But I got that Hercules hustle you can't challenge my grind
My partnas had money but got mad when I had to get mine
That's why I took the time to tell em to kiss my ass in this rhyme
They said I didn't even rap good enough to go get a stack
But now I'm headlining a long way from the opening act
They wanted to burn my dreams I still smell the smoke in the back
Even if they kill me I'll come back homie to go and get that, that's right

[Hook]
I know they don't give a fuck about me
I promise I'll be happy alone
Whether you see me on TV or these streets
My attitude is leave me the fuck alone
I know they don't give a fuck about me
I promise I'll be happy alone
Whether you see me on TV or these streets
I'm not a rapper homie I'm just a G

[Verse 3]
White boy Jimmy, he the reaslest nigga I know
It's because of him I'm walking the streets a free man, and I appreciate that bro
God damn, I don't wanna go to prison no mo'
Beside T. Farris and bitches, don't nobody visit no mo'
I'm not complaining my nigga just saying how it is
They say it's lonely at the top I guess that's how it is
I swear I ain't seen nobody in the last thirty days
Ro must of fell off that's what them haters that can't stand me say
But I ain't never been a bitch don't know how to be a ho
Only thang I know how to do is collect that dough
If you owe me money pay me on time
And 7 tre fo' 2-4 death before dishonor on mine
Me be a punk?
I would have to leave this world for that
Matter fact my mama could of had a girl for that
I'm cool as a popsicle in the freezer in the winter time
But I'm a damn fool and I have about respect so give me mine

[Hook]
I know they don't give a fuck about me
I promise I'll be happy alone
Whether you see me on TV or these streets
My attitude is leave me the fuck alone
I know they don't give a fuck about me
I promise I'll be happy alone
Whether you see me on TV or these streets
I'm not a rapper homie I'm just a G
