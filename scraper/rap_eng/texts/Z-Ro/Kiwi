[Chorus]
Yeah
That thing look just like a kiwi
When we be on top of these sheets (Right cheek left cheek right cheek left cheek)
How could I ever leave thee
Take off your bra take off your panties we don't need these
Yeah
That thing look just like a kiwi
When we be on top of these sheets (Right cheek left cheek right cheek left cheek)
How could I ever leave thee
Take off your bra take off your panties we don't need these

[Verse 1]
(Talk to 'em)
She ain't a thot, she ain't easy (Nah)
But when she with me she so sleazy (Damn right)
She like to handle business she don't tease me (Nah)
She get 8 or 9 and I'ma get at least 3 (For real though)
When she wake up she be like don't ever leave me
I be like as long as you keep it real you can keep me
And she be tripping if she can't reach me (Hello)
That's what happens when you go in it too deep see

[Hook]
She never wear clothes around me she always in the nude
And I be going raw cause she don't be with different dudes
Take it off baby bend over let me see it
You was looking for a trill ass nigga I had to be it

[Chorus]
Yeah
That thing look just like a kiwi
When we be on top of these sheets (Right cheek left cheek right cheek left cheek)
How could I ever leave thee
Take off your bra take off your panties we don't need these
Yeah
That thing look just like a kiwi
When we be on top of these sheets (Right cheek left cheek right cheek left cheek)
How could I ever leave thee
Take off your bra take off your panties we don't need these

[Verse 2]
Listen
And every time she see me (see me)
She tells me how bad she been wanting to see me (see me)
Gangsta movies on the tv (for real though)
But I ain't watching it I'm trying to make her pee pee (new sheets nigga)
That thing look just like a kiwi (coochiefruit)
She so wet it's really greasy (She nasty though)
Go hard like I'm in the D League (in the Dick League)
She say you know how to please me (going in)
I cut my phone on silent
She got a degree in reverse cowgirl riding (She graduated)
On top of the cover that's what we're laying on (Yeah)
She so fine I got to see, the lights staying on (Vandross)

{Chorus]
Yeah
That thing look just like a kiwi
When we be on top of these sheets (Right cheek left cheek right cheek left cheek)
How could I ever leave thee
Take off your bra take off your panties we don't need these
Yeah
That thing look just like a kiwi
When we be on top of these sheets (Right cheek left cheek right cheek left cheek)
How could I ever leave thee
Take off your bra take off your panties we don't need these

[Hook]
She never wear clothes around me she's always in the nude
And I be going raw cause she don't be with different dudes
Take it off baby bend over let me see it
You was looking for a trill ass nigga I had to be it

{Chorus]
Yeah
That thing look just like a kiwi
When we be on top of these sheets (Right cheek left cheek right cheek left cheek)
How could I ever leave thee
Take off your bra take off your panties we don't need these
