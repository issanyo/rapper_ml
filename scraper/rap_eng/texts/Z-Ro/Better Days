[Verse 1]
We live bout the life this ain't a fairytale
50 percent of my niggas are either dead or in jail
I know heaven awaits cuz we are living in hell
Just funerals and waits somebody say a prayer
Write for the state give my nigga the job
Without the facts don't know if ever this clear
With my healthcare ain't no matters in here
86 is a dog to prescribe a pill
They tell me it's the white man I should fear
It's my own kind doing all the killing here
Pain is motivation, trials and tribulations
Created a monster now you gotta face him
I hold you responsible for these crack babies
Niggas stay strong sending all the block crazy
Call us maybe took a villains' to raise me
Running life didn't escape me chasing this paper daily

[Chorus]
Like if I don't hustle I'ma going to die
It's so fucked up all I can do is wonder why
Better days
Scratch and scrape for a plate trying to make a wait
If you humble in the jungle you become the pray
Is this the military of the streets
Don't be a victim either you get there or you leave
Better days
Scratch and scrape for a plate trying to make a wait
If you humble in the jungle you become the pray

[Verse 2]
Is there a heaven for a real nigga like me
I'm on a mission homie I ain't here to sightsee
See that's a gun in your pocket I'm like it might be
I don't give a damn if none of you bitches like me
They keep killing us why the fuck we gotta  kill each other
Agree or don't disagree even if we don't feel each other
My people are reason my people are being robbed nightly
They can't afford to go out the hood to rob whitey
They wish they were lucky enough to have a job like me
It's fucked up they be like you bro been working hard slightly
Instant oatmeal for breakfast, lunch and dinner too
I know they tired of that shit I know I feel it too

[Chorus]
Like if I don't hustle I'ma going to die
It's so fucked up all I can do is wonder why
Better days
Scratch and scrape for a plate trying to make a wait
If you humble in the jungle you become the pray
Is this the military of the streets
Don't be a victim either you get there or you leave
Better days
Scratch and scrape for a plate trying to make a wait
If you humble in the jungle you become the pray

[Verse 3]
The rules of engagement the coons and the gangstas
Shooters to the shakers jackass to the crankers
Keep wanting your chamber
If you broken while swinging these treats ain't planned police ain't caring
For CPS your parents cross paps overdosed on heroin
So not even billing it's so overwhelming a kid with no feeling
He's a soon a dealing man  and soon he'll be killing
And we be damned if we gon starve in this bitch
Every nigga like we back to stealing cars In this bitch
December 25th they robbed Santa Claus in this bitch
They get it a dome back with the only way they know how
I bet they thought we was planned but I bet they know now
This is a stick up so get your ass sat down on the floor now
If you give them your duty my people don't come to your house
I'm clueless what you go make me put this gun in your mouth

[Chorus]
Like if I don't hustle I'ma going to die
It's so fucked up all I can do is wonder why
Better days
Scratch and scrape for a plate trying to make a wait
If you humble in the jungle you become the pray
Is this the military of the streets
Don't be a victim either you get there or you leave
Better days
Scratch and scrape for a plate trying to make a wait
If you humble in the jungle you become the pray
