[Chorus]
Tryna find some killer dojee in the hood today
I hope I can find a spot (I can find a spot)
Don't wanna end up with no bullshit and waste my money
Because that's gon' run me hot (That's gon' run me hot)
Look, I just wanna smoke some weed (Smoke some weed)
And if you would please, homie, no sticks, no seeds (No seed)

[Verse 1]
Damn, I only got a half a bag on me
Text my D, "I need eleven mo' bags, homie"
He ain't text me back yet, it's lookin' kind of bad for me
I can do it all, but I don't wanna take the chance, homie
When I'm sober like this, I got a attitude
On some "Get the fuck up out my face!", baby, you have to move
I need a zip, half a zip, hell, I'll take a seven
Fuck it, even a three point five, as long as I'm in Heaven
But it gotta be that fire
What is this? The Devil is a liar
I'm lookin' for something that's gon' take me higher
If you sellin' it, then I will be your buyer

[Chorus]
Tryna find some killer dojee in the hood today
I hope I can find a spot (I can find a spot)
Don't wanna end up with no bullshit and waste my money
Because that's gon' run me hot (That's gon' run me hot)
Look, I just wanna smoke some weed (Smoke some weed)
And if you would please, homie, no sticks, no seeds (No seed)

[Verse 2]
Yeah, found a couple grey hairs, guess a nigga stressin'
Plus, they been trippin' in the hood, I need a bigger weapon
Everybody got they hands out like I'm 'posed to pay
Puttin' they problems on top of mine, the fuck I'm 'posed to say?
They want the shirt off my back, and they want my coat today
Half a pound of Moon Rock, the perfect way to cope today
I wanna have a drink, but really need to smoke today
Campaign for Mary Jane, like I'm going to [? 2:25] today
Prayin' for my big homie, he fuckin' with that coke today
Nigga like me, I'ma have to say "No" today
I smoke a blunt to take the pain out
And if I wasn't high, I'd probably try to blow my brains out

[Chorus]
Tryna find some killer dojee in the hood today
I hope I can find a spot (I can find a spot)
Don't wanna end up with no bullshit and waste my money
Because that's gon' run me hot (That's gon' run me hot)
Look, I just wanna smoke some weed (Smoke some weed)
And if you would please, homie, no sticks, no seeds (No seed)

[Verse 3]
Nothing but love is on my mind
Anything that ya want from me, gotta wait 'til I get high
I'm not capping, but only that loud is on my mind
But if you wanna match a Sweet, well, I think we can compromise, baby

[Chorus]
Tryna find some killer dojee in the hood today
I hope I can find a spot (I can find a spot)
Don't wanna end up with no bullshit and waste my money
Because that's gon' run me hot (That's gon' run me hot)
Look, I just wanna smoke some weed (Smoke some weed)
And if you would please, homie, no sticks, no seeds (No seed)
