And these days
Seem like wherever I go the fake taking over like real ain't cool no more
And these days
Don't nobody show love
Instead of lending a helping hand they want to see blood
And these days
I know that god be so mad
Daughters disrespect their mothers like sons do their dads and these days
I just don't know what to do struggling just to make it homie what about you?

Uhh and these days seem like the definition of real done changed
Like today it's cool to drop salt on your partners name
It's cool to shake your homies hand but then go sex his dame
She pregnant and yo homie thinks it's his that's a damn shame
Seem like today it's cool to be gay cause these women be having more women than Joseph McVey
And it seems like none of my partners ain't partners no more they all enemies
Acting like they down with me I know they just pretend to be
Mama get beat by dad and you look just like your father so mama treat you bad
You feel like your something your parents wish they never had
That's the reason you out all night and never at the pad ready to whop somebodies ass
But that ain't the solution then you'll be like me and end up in an institution
No I don't know you I'm just trying to make a contribution
Hoping you don't end up on death row looking at execution, lethal injection, or electrocution
Or even worse somebody you disrespected comes and puts you in the dirt
I know if you can't get rid of tension living hurts
Just try to vent your frustration
Doing something that won't prepare you to ride in a hearse
It's easier said than done
Soon as you solve a problem your facing another one deal with one player hater and here another one come
Deserving the whole cake but end up with nothing but crumbs
I know you feel like your done but the devil is a lie
Trying to make you think he's down with you and god want you to die
Well tell me why he sent his son here to be crucified?
On a cross with a crown of thorns on his head and a spear on his side he hung, bleed and died
But it ain't gone ever change
Those of us that are hard headed gone end up in the flame
Worshiping idol gods like power and money, mayne
I did it myself but realized I had to change knowing my people won't do the same

And these days
Seem like where ever I go the fake taking over like real ain't cool no more
And these days don't nobody show love
Instead of lending a helping hand they want to see blood
And these days
I know that god be so mad
Daughters disrespect their mothers like sons do their dads
And these days
I just don't know what to do struggling
Just to make it homie what about youuuuuuu?
