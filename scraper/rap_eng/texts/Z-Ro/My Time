[Verse 1]
I use to try to get her to come over, she would never come for me
Now all she wanna do, is come over and cum for me
Even willing to risk her freedom, make a run for me
Always trying to lay up under me, and get some from me
Look I ain't with that shit, I'm on my grind
Pay for this and pay for that, that's what stay on my mind
I ain't never had shit, I was poor like y'all
I slept outside, I ain't get to sleep on the floor like y'all
(I use to have nothing), now I'm on tour like y'all
Shout out to the angels in heaven, trying to soar like y'all
Vienna sausages, that use to be like everyday
Just champagne and Hawaiian ribeye, so much better today
Ball forever, they trying to take my forever away
Leaving court, the prosecutor be like it's better to stay
Shit, why the fuck you think my money long fo' then
I'll buy the not guilty I'll write a check, let me see yo' pen

[Hook]
Money, hoes, cars, clothes
What I went through to get here, only God knows
I'm on my grind, you know I
Gotta get that paper, no lie
Wasn't over night, I had to start slow
Now I got me some foreign's in the garage bro
It's my time, and you know I
Gotta get that paper, no lie

[Verse 2]
Say, I been up a whole 72
Getting money, is what I will never forget to do
I got goddaughters for sale, go 'head and get you two
600 a onion, all the smokers gon' be next to you
Meanwhile, I'm up in Clover with that bag on me
I punk two hundred sixty thou', that's all I had on me
Look I'm just being honest, I'm not trying to brag on me
And I can't fuck with skinny jeans, I like to sag homie
Only tight shit I wanna see, on a sexy bitch
She might get a crib, with one percent of what God blessed me with
Y'all like to call it tips, I call it housing
Woulda been at the W, but we in Hershey clowning
Her bra and panties, on the ceiling fan spinning
I don't get naked, I'm pants socks and shoes when I'm up in it
I got thirty condoms on me, I won't need no Penicillin
That way, she can't even baby mama me out of millions

[Hook]
Money, hoes, cars, clothes
What I went through to get here, only God knows
I'm on my grind, you know I
Gotta get that paper, no lie
Wasn't over night, I had to start slow
Now I got me some foreign's in the garage bro
It's my time, and you know I
Gotta get that paper, no lie

[Hook 2]
You know I, gotta get that money no lie
And you know I, be in the foreign every time it go by
No lie, I got my ones and I'm about to go live
No lie, I'm taking all these bitches with me tonight

[Hook]
Money, hoes, cars, clothes
What I went through to get here, only God knows
I'm on my grind, you know I
Gotta get that paper, no lie
Wasn't over night, I had to start slow
Now I got me some foreign's in the garage bro
It's my time, and you know I
Gotta get that paper, no lie
