[Chorus]
We the people
Wonder when this shit gon’ change
Ask me, I say this shit won’t change
We the people
We just tryna get mo change
But they makin' sure we get no gains
We the people
Even though we play so hard
We don’t fuck with ya kids, you prey on ours
We the people
We ain’t tryna wait on God
But mean while we gotta stay on guard

[Verse 1]
Uh, my president ain’t black right now
We got a racist in the white house
It’s so wack right now
The devil turnin' up
He don’t know how to act right now
And I ain’t hatin’ but where the real Kanye at right now
So I can’t sit inside a Starbucks and wait on my friends
They don’t even know me they hate me
They just hate on my skin
How disrespectful is these clothes gon’ get
Call me the coolest monkey in the jungle
And act like I ain’t supposed to trip
They say slavery was a choice now, for real my nigga?
So they was like "fuck being a king let’s work in a field" my nigga?
Want me to call that bastard master after he killed my niggas?
Still in it been way more than 400 years my nigga

[Chorus]
We the people
Wonder when this shit gon’ change
Ask me, I say this shit won’t change
We the people
We just tryna get mo change
But they makin sure we get no gains
We the people
Even though we play so hard
We don’t fuck with ya kids, you prey on ours
We the people
We ain’t tryna wait on God
But mean while we gotta stay on guard

[Verse 2]
Listen, my patna Syl he a chef
But they call him a cook
Don’t wanna give my man his props
Because of the way that he look (That’s fucked up)
Havin what they say we can’t afford
They say that we took
Like our money from sellin' crack
To all the babies we hooked
Nah
I got the same million dollars they got
So they should look at me like we equal
But I know they not
I gives a fuck
I eat up all of they kale and drank up they scotch
I’m still a nigga though
Even though I got what they got
And fuck a Waffle House
We don’t need that greasy ass shit
And that ole pile of police
Every time they see me ass, bitch
Bitch I go to Yale and can’t even fall asleep in the common room
Without having to show my ID, why me?
When I talk about the way these police is killing blacks
They be like “not more than y’all kill each other and that’s a fact”
Yeah it’s fucked up
But we ain’t here serve and protect
It’s y’alls motto
But to us it fell like murder and neglect

[Chorus]
We the people
Wonder when this shit gon’ change
Ask me, I say this shit won’t change
We the people
We just tryna get mo change
But they makin' sure we get no gains
We the people
Even though we play so hard
We don’t fuck with ya kids, you prey on ours
We the people
We ain’t tryna wait on God
But mean while we gotta stay on guard
