[Verse 1]
Want me to treat you like my queen
Realize I'm your king then
But if you looking for somebody to kiss your ass
Don't fuck with me then
I just want to get in there, like swimwear, leave it leaking
But this shit so crazy nowadays we ain't even speaking
You say what's the problem and I tell you
But then you tell me that's not the problem (Damn)
You always on that bitch shit, don't wanna fix shit
So who got the problem (Damn)
Every time I say something you gotta say something
You can't listen if you're talking
I'ma be a man but you won't let me be a man
I'ma pack my shit and I'm walking (I'm out this bitch man)
I ain't saying I'm perfect baby (perfect baby)
But you gon' fuck around and give me a stroke
This shit ain't worth it baby (Got me fucked up though)
Since you wanna run shit maybe you should get a bitch
Just too damn hard headed
And when your ratchet ass friends say something bout me
You act just like God said it (Shake my head)
Lord knows I've tried (tried)
To put the bullshit aside (aside)
Swallow my pride (pride)
But now I couldn't let it slide (Hahaha)
You say you want me but you ain't doing it right (doing it right)
You must be tripping if you think Z-Ro need you in his life (Vandross)

[Chorus]
You's a bitch
Don't you ever get tired of acting like a bitch
You ain't shit
Can you please get up off my, off my
With that shit you be on
Cause all I need from you is for you to get the fuck on

[Verse 2]
Some of these niggas is bitches too (bitches too)
And some of these niggas look just like you (just like you)
Mad at me cause I'm ballin' and you can't afford a baseball
Everytime I pull up in that foreign I see it all over your face dog
Why don't you get your hustle on then (hustle on then)
Cause even after I die I bet my hustle won't end (One Deep
Entertainment)
But y'all ain't no hustlers, y'all some roaches and y'all know it too
Mad at Z-Ro cause Z-Ro won't give none of his dough to you (Ah ha)
What the fuck I look like taking care of grown men (nothing)
If I got mine why the fuck you can't get your own ends (nothing)
"Can I borrow 400 Rotha?"
Hell no you can't (no you can't)
"But I promise I'ma pay you back my nigga"
Hell no you ain't (no you ain't)
Nigga say I don't give back to my hood, but that's just a damn lie (damn lie)
Nigga ain't even from my hood, he's just some random damn guy (Oh)
I ain't got nothing but blessings waiting on me
Much love to the real niggas but if y'all hating on me

[Chorus]
You's a bitch
Don't you ever get tired of acting like a bitch
You ain't shit
Can you please get up off my, off my
With that shit you be on
Cause all I need from you is for you to get the fuck on

Ain't no motherfucking love for you niggas and you hoes
Well
I say all of y'all
You know I said all of y'all
Can kiss my ass
Cause I never gave a fuck
About you, you, and you
All of y'all
You know I said all of y'all
Can kiss my ass
