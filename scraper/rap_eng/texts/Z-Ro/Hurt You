[Chorus]
I've been in the streets a long time
Tryna get money one deep a long time
And I ain't gon' starve, I'ma eat a long time
(You don't know love from the boy a long time)
I feel like I've been my own squad a long time
My people been actin' real fraud a long time
Had me wonderin' why I talked to God a long time
(Fightin' in this war for a long, long time)

[Verse 1]
Yeah, seems like ever since I handed out them "one deep" chains
I ain't seen nobody, I've been one deep man
It's all good, y'all don't gotta fuck wit' me mane
Table full of food, I will eat at every seat mane
Fuck everybody, when you see me don't speak mane
What would Jesus do? Turn the other cheek mane
Give a nigga the game, but he ain't gonna appreciate it
Yeah, I got on my shades but I could still see ya hate
Feel free to hate on me, it's what I'm here fo
Bourbon by the bottle, you're barely keepin' your beer cold (Sucka)
These bitches always tell me yes, I never hear no
They know I'm a real nigga, not a weirdo
But I don't want shit from 'em though, I'm alright
How the hell they walls tight if they been fuckin' all night
That's that burnin' when you pee shit, I'm good on it
I need none of y'all, I'ma put my hood on it

[Chorus]
I've been in the streets a long time
Tryna get money one deep a long time
And I ain't gon' starve, I'ma eat a long time
(You don't know love from the boy a long time)
I feel like I've been my own squad a long time
My people been actin' real fraud a long time
Had me wonderin' why I talked to God a long time
(Fightin' in this war for a long, long time)

[Verse 2]
They want me to help 'em 'til I can't help 'em no mo
As soon as I can't help 'em I'm a hoe-hoe
"Ro ya wanna roll wit' us?" Fuckas I'ma go fo
'Cause they know Ro get in free wherever Ro go
1500 on a meal, he gon' drop a 10 (Damn)
Nigga you know you outta line, all I do is grin
I know you wanna see me lose, all I do is win
Mad 'cause I'm feelin' blessed, he act like all I do is sin
I don't shake hands, that's nasty
But I might take a picture dependin' how I'm feelin' when you ask me
So many people tried to rob me, kill me
Fuck you and what you think about my attitude, ya feel me? (Fuck all y'all)
I don't do it to sell records, this the real me
Shit I ain't never had a record deal anyway
I know y'all ain't really with me, y'all just in the way
Just here to get what you can get and make a getaway

[Chorus]
I've been in the streets a long time
Tryna get money one deep a long time
And I ain't gon' starve, I'ma eat a long time
(You don't know love from the boy a long time)
I feel like I've been my own squad a long time
My people been actin' real fraud a long time
Had me wonderin' why I talked to God a long time
(Fightin' in this war for a long, long time)

[Verse 3]
Listen, he say stop fuckin' with him, I'll put you in that bag
I guess I ain't really wanna win that bad
Turn my back on my friend like that
(Uh)
I know y'all think it really ain't, but it really is like that
A lotta niggas made they careers like that
Homies like "why he disappear like that?" (Like that, like that)
He gone
Shit, ol' Judas ass nigga gon' stand up (Oh)
For 30 pieces of silver, you give your man up (Oh)
When it's roll call for bitch niggas, hold ya hand up (Oh)
We the real niggas, we know y'all don't ever stand up
Ain't nobody fuckin' us, don't gotta pull our pants up
That's why we end up in the grave or in handcuffs

[Chorus]
I've been in the streets a long time
Tryna get money one deep a long time
And I ain't gon' starve, I'ma eat a long time
(You don't know love from the boy a long time)
I feel like I've been my own squad a long time
My people been actin' real fraud a long time
Had me wonderin' why I talked to God a long time
(Fightin' in this war for a long, long time)
