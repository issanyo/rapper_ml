[Verse 1]
Uh
We used to be so good in the beginning
But my patience ain't shit, I couldn't deal with the trippin'
Hell yeah imma be around hoes look at what I do for a livin'
Tried to take yo shit tried to not get shot
Go to court tried not to go to prison
Yo friend said this and yo friend said that
But does yo friend even know where yo friend man at
Shit, misery loves company baby
And I'll be damned if I let yo misery drive me crazy baby

[Bridge]
So imma pull out my RAW papers and imma roll on up
Pull out that big bottle of drank and po' on up
King Louie OG for me, lil Platinum kush for you
Instead of breaking up, gettin' high gettin' drunk, this is all we do

[Hook x2]
We don't even fuck no mo', we don't even touch no mo'
We don't even talk no mo', all we do is drank and smoke
We don't even kiss no mo', we don't do shit no mo'
We don't even laugh no mo', all we do is drank and smoke

[Verse 2]
Yeah
I'd rather be bendin' you over the couch
But just to be honest woman I'm tired of hearing yo mouth
Who the fuck is Keisha I don't know what you talkin' about
Yeah you a sexy motherfucka
But I don't want you to come to my house
And it's a god damn shame, we can't even get along
Make me wanna chunk the deuces
I want you but baby don't get me wrong
I hate you bitch, that's the type of shit you gonna get me on
When I walk in the do' you wanna smell my dick
Tryna see what numbers I got in my phone

[Bridge]
So imma pull out my RAW papers and imma roll on up
Pull out that big bottle of drank and po' on up
King Louie OG for me, lil Platinum kush for you
Instead of breaking up, gettin' high gettin' drunk, this is all we do

[Verse 3]
Studio right now got court in the morning, baby I got shit to do
And if I walk outta court I got a magazine interview I got shit to do
After that I gotta go check on my daughter baby I got shit to do
I got moves to make and I got bills to pay
So everyday ain't gon' be spent with you
You always thankin' there's another woman involved
But I be on my grind
If it ain't about gettin' me to the next level
Well then it ain't on my mind
Our business is our business
And whatever was said was said between us
You gon' let yo Instagram and yo Facebook out a wedge between us

[Hook x2]
