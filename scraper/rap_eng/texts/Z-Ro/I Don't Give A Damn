[Intro:]
I need Christ
That's the only thing I know
I really can't breathe right
I'm strangled by animosity from my own people
Lately it's hard to be nice
My face is frowned up everywhere I go
And I can't sleep nights
I'm in my ride tryin to find my foes (Why You Be Trippin Z-ro?)

[Verse 1:]
They say my music won't make it, cause I don't rap cars and dancing
I rap pain, poverty, and fraud romancing
Who gon represent for that brother on death row
And let him know whether he did it or not god had his back from the get go
A lil mama that's hustlin
Riskin her freedom
House full of kids and none of the baby daddies around
And she just tryn to feed em
Even if she's layin on her back for bread
Instead of talkin about her show her to earn it without opening legs
Why my people rather point fingers and turn up their noses
Showin love then strikin a match, ya ain't that so explosive
('stead of showin love, they strikin a match at anger so explosive)
And I'm guilty just like everybody else
So when I'm talkin to ya'll, I'm talkin to self
I know your tired of shown love and never gettin it showed back to ya
When all you need is a hug your people show they backs to ya
Well hear me when I tell you everytime the world in a devil dig shift (dis ya)
If God is your homie, can't nobody in the world fuck with ya...

[Hook:]
If you feel like you wanna die sometimes you can release stress to this
Just keep God first in your life
Even when you feel like he ain't blessin it
If you get mad like I get mad
Then you be agged like everyday
But all u gotta do is learn to let go and let God handle it
And then you can say...
I don't give a damn
But all these fellas droppin salt on your name
I don't give a damn
But you can't pay your bills cuz your short on your change
I don't give a damn
Man I just saw your woman huggin and kissin another man
I don't give a damn
Cuz God got me & if u don't know you better ask somebody...

[Verse 2:]
800 days, minimum wage
About to lose your house if you don't get a raise
Just stay close to goin to work with the 12 gauge
You you see a new millennium
But feel like your in the stone age
Stressin every 7 minutes from livin with aids
Subtracting days from your life but because of the virus
You dying from worry and thangs you can't change
Be mad at satan, there's too many other name's to blame
Only God can bring forth rain to smother pain flames
And then the sun gon shine
No matter what the doctor tell you
The Lord decide when it's the end of your time
Just look at Magic
Ya it was tragic
But he's still at it
Lookin, functionin, and feelin fantastic
I know my people cry a river
And it's alright to cry
But don't commit suicide
You can't make it to heaven taking your own life
So repeat after me:
The devil ain't pimpin me
Cuz I can do all things through Jesus Christ who strengthens me!

[Hook]

[Verse 3:]
Look lil mama I can feel what your goin through
Your another diamond dancin at the player's club
Tryin to pay your way through school
And to the brother that's out jackin brothers who don better
Homie you ain't gotta do it like that
I know it's diffcult tryin to make it if you ain't havin cheddar
But what you gon do when brother's strike back?
And just because your white and I'm not
Doesn't mean tryin to plot on takin your last dime
But I know just because I got a diamond grill in my mouth
You thinkin I wanna steal dolla bills out your house
Even though u think I'm an animal I don't give a damn
A True Hero Under God, thats what I am...
WHOO!

[Hook]
