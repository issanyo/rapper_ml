[Hook: Z-Ro & Slim Thug]
Shopping sprees and trips overseas if you like that girl (She love my swag)
Baby, even my weed is more than a couple of G's, if you like that girl (She love my swag)
All this money that I make is the reason the haters hate, they don't like that girl (But she love my swag)
That's why you rollin' with me, I'm what a G supposed to be
I know you like that girl (And you love my swag)

[Verse 1: Slim Thug]
I know she love my swag
I can bag 500 on the tag
Louis kicks, Hermes 'round the waist
A thug nigga but I got good taste
Take a look in the mirror it can be no clearer
I'm the cleanest nigga here it appears
Them girls shed tears of joy just to be in my presence
Look at me, you lookin' at a legend
I'm into spreadin' love for whoever love Thug
Got my back, I got your back no if and's or but's
Got me thinkin' like us cause she ride for a nigga
I'm talkin' 'bout bend down, junior high for a nigga
A die for a nigga, so when I shine she shine
Baby girl deserve it all, when I was broke she held me down
So, now she get her time shopping sprees by the dime
Chanel purses paid for bodies verses I rhyme

Baby you can push the Bentley if you wanna
Even the Phantom is cool for you to bend a couple corners
I'm a thug in harmony I know you want me to bone ya (bone bone bone bone)
Usually you'd have to pay me just to put this thang on ya
But I'm diggin' you and plus I know you diggin' this swag
30 thousand or better every time I dig in this bag
Hustle so hard she like don't forget to dig in this ass
So acrobatic, I don't know nobody flip 'em this fast
Got some police's on my payroll
And they know can't arrest me, gotta let Mr. McVey go
That's why she rolling with me when I'm gettin' my hands dirty
Same shit I'm doin' same shit that got my man's dirty
Got arthritis from counting money, I need hand surgery
Ain't no limit to my Bout It Bout It, yes I am Percy
Young Clarence Carter strokin' like a motherfucker
Walmart pussy, always open like a motherfucker
