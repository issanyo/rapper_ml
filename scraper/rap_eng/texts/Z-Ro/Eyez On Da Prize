Verse 1
How much longer do i have to suffer
Cause i can recall being told that it would get greater later but it keeps on gettin ruffer
Dealin with devlish dudes on a day to day baises
But if a nigga dont deal with em how da fuck am i gonna make some franklin faces
I got da do what i got da do to maintain
Im gettin sued about to do some time
Plus my whole family left me cause im insane
Pain mary jane ain't even relaxin da strain
Sometimes i think about blowin out my mother fuckin brain
After da rain it ain't no sun atleast not where i come from
Every day be gloomy and grey
Still i try to hold my head up but im so fed up
Everything im in love with is a wieght
Guess im back on my own again
Gota get used to bein at home alone
Nigga no water no light no phone
Im sittin all day dreamin about bein gone

Young nigga keep your eyez on da prize
If u foucus on your goals u just might reach em before you die
Take your precious and your pains and just let go and let god
Maybe he can kick it wit u when da times get hard
Cause i wouldn't tell u nothin that would hurtcha
Just tryin to give some game so u won't run into a murda
So take your precious and your pains and just let go and let god
Maybe he can kick it wit u when da times get hard
Verse 2
Everday is a constant grind a nigga dont never be gettin no rest
24/7 about my fede and if its necessary a block get swept
Z-ro is a neat freak any theres to many moutherfuckin dirty rats in dis game
Im all about my furtone i wouldn't give a fuck about da fame
But everyone keep on yellin out my name
Im a drug addict just tryin to hold on to my sanity losin my grip
Smokin on dosha wit da weed and da codiene so fucked up i can't understand shit
All i know is i got my motherfuckin pistol to protect me
Cause on a constant baises fools be tryin to wet me
Even still i turn to da bible and im hopin in da righteous path could direct me
Before strays fuck around and do more than graze and disect me
Im livin dis thug life and i can't make it no clearer
Unlike these feminine fellas dat practice mean muggin in the mirror
U ain't no gangsta nigga yous a bitch but z-ro be out on da block
Lookin for luda lil jewelries livin wit lavish habits till i get it can't stop
Ima be on my own my friend tryin to deal wit life
So ima handle my business to be a big man
Nigga fuck crackin up i gotta keep my mind straight to get paid
Bitch i gotta get a grip

Verse 3
Lately ive been thinkin
While im smokin and im drinkin
Why do i go through everything a person can go through
And lately ive been hurtin
Cause im smothered by my burdens
And there ain't nothing i can do except let go and let u do wut u do
Let me touch da hem of your garmet
Cause i promise my life is a target
And i dont know which way to go
Unless im on my way to da weed house or da liqour sto
