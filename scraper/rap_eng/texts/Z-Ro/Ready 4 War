If he was close to the edge, then I'll give him a push
And do this whole world a favor, hey there howdy neighbor
Shit, I'm sorry I took so long to save you
I was getting my dick sucked, by my secretary
She asked me my sign, I told her bitch Aires

I paint the white house black, and start renting it out

[Archie Lee]
In this underground game, I'm rolling with S.L.A.B

Steady riding my dick, like bitches do

Hershelwood for life, matter fact it's all good bitch

[Trae]
I heard a nigga in the game, was saying my name
But now my Glock is fully loaded, and ready to aim
S-L-A-B until I'm gone, and I'm repping it strong
You don't wanna see these gorillas, running up in your home
Everybody better clear the lot, when the lights off
I set it off, when I luger ride for the cause
And fuck the law, I'ma mash till I'm finished and done
And when it's all said and done, I'ma be number one
And I bet that I'm a soldier that'll fold you, I done told you
Niggas getting ran over, in a Rover
Trae forever staying sober, like a Jehovah
Witness I'm at your door brah, door brah

[Hook -]

And sweep up, that street

Never slacking or lacking, still attacking like I'm Sadaam
Set it off like the chirp that's going off, on the alarm
Doing harm nigga we swarm, on any and every hater in sight
Fuck around and call a nigga Teddy, steady turning off your lights

Dog better get the fuck back, 'fore I fuck around and leave a nigga flat
With a cardiac heart attack, slugs stuck off in your back
See I ain't tripping mayn, I'm one of the young guerillas
That's stacking scrilla, slash a killa cause I'm a made nigga
You don't wanna get hauled on, or straight clicked on
I've been a G ever since the day, that I left home

[Trae]
S-L-A-B, one of these motherfuckers finna see
I've been a sad cat with a fat cat all the way back, still spitting with heat
One of the rap game phenomenon's, me and my click be ready for war
You better get your entourage, 'fore you get calicoes through your car
Or you'll get a 44 to your jaw, ain't no love boxing we raw
And if you really think that we playing, step in the ring so you can get scarred
Guerillas ready for havoc, on a mission to let you have it
To tell the truth I done had it, this game is really fin to get tragic
I ain't having when I'm busting on first and ten, I'ma be rushing
Till a nigga left with concussions, bring the end of discussion dog
You don't wanna get me pissed off or ticked off your ass is fin to get pissed on
Not dissed on but clicked on, for stepping inside my zone

[Mr. 3-2]
50 Cent, baby that's nothing but chump change
Shooting slugs at my partna, disrespecting the game
So feel this verbal cocaine, your whole tape was trash
Now the whole Screwed Up Click, gon beat that ass
So when you come in H-Town, don't hide behind your circle
We gon tear the club up, leave both your eyes purple
Hurt you bitch nigga, that's from the Boss Man
I'm known for slapping boys, knocking em out with my hands
Understand bow down, and show some respect
We clicked up and heated, with knifes hanging round our neck
I'm a cold blooded killa, do a murder for the price
So call the ambulance, and put this bitch up on some ice

[Hook -]
