Ooh lord, you're you're such a fucking baby
How the fuck do I forget that shit every time? It's my fault
Maybe I should set an alarm, I mean damn
Even so much more lately and every time I'm still shocked and appalled like
Maybe Jean you should recall how this nigga lane be
And every time you try to make things right he burns it down to the ground
Don't turn around
You such a fucking victim, ain't ya
That kinda thing is just your nature
Well I kinda hate ya, oh
I loved you baby but that don't make me wrong
How many damn apologies can one man want?
You run then walk right back to guilty threads I won't
You must be fucking crazy
To think I wanna stay in a loss
I tried to let you get your player shit off
But let's be real, you never really understood how to feel
Can I get a witness?
I bet I could, so many bitches
And if everybody had a bit of you in 'em man they would be assholes
Bitter women, definitive feminists, giving this nigga the pass though
Remember that Jean is the enemy
You fill in the memory with an epiphany
That was a phony epiphany
What are you kidding? We been in the moment again and again I'm living no more
I made the decision to kick in the bucket and clicked the phone call
Off, boss, stick to being the victim most of time
Post up your lines, blah blah blah blah, instagram
Quit your damn crying
Bitch you a damn lie
Bitch you a damn lie
