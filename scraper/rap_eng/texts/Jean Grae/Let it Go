[Verse 1]
I'm sittin' sippin' soda realizin' that it's over
My feelings he couldn't reciprocate til October
But he's the one I wanna lay my head upon his shoulder
And keep it warm because it's just about to get colder
But I said I wouldn't see him, nor would I touch him
He says he misses me much and pursue per sound to suction
Through the phone, I try to hit the dialtone to clear the mess up
Or fess up, and say I'll be there soon just clear your rest up
I can't dismiss it, no matter how much I just can't resist it
And now he's tellin' me he finally wants to be committed
I can't call it, without me playin' myself to fall for it
Scannin' my mind to see how much time I can stall
Or it can blow up, other kissings affect like anesthetic
It's never as good as the first time and you never do forget it
Feeling pathetic, but I quote it like someone said it
If you really love it then you should just let it, go

[Hook]
Let it go, let it flow
Move on with your life and act like you know
Been on my last breathe, been between life and death
But I gotta let it go, can't deal with the stress
I let it, go let it go, let it flow
Move on with your life and just act like you know
Been on my last breathe, been between life and death
But I gotta let it go, can't deal with the stress

[Verse 2]
Three times this year I've seen my people go to violent action
That could have been avoided without negative instigation
Goin' on, off at the mouth, with foul verbal interaction
Inevitably ending up with one or more gunshot patients
I guess it's not a virtue anymore and scores gotta be settled
With steel or real ain't even in the flesh and don't feel
But eighteen feet of soil was dug out
Three brothers lives was struck out
Cause you wanted to be down, but without catchin a body you stuck out
Hey, what goes around is ultimately what you get
Sometimes good people and bad things mix
Sometimes you got to fix the way you live
I give my life to bring back family and friends
But I don't control that I know that mine's precious til the end
I leave my lifecourse to the greater knowledge of the creator
And if it's time to go, I won't hold back, I'll just let it, go
Let it flow, if it's meant to come back then it shall do so

[Hook]
Let it go, let it flow
Move on with your life and act like you know
Been on my last breathe, been between life and death
But I gotta let it go, can't deal with the stress
I let it, go let it go, let it flow
Move on with your life and just act like you know
Been on my last breathe, been between life and death
But I gotta let it go, can't deal with the stress

[Verse 3]
At thirteen I watched ghetto gold turn to green
And get crushed, through this undramatical street scene
When all my peoples like to whyle out
Wearin' the low style out
One night we stood in front of Homebase
Watched the club file out
Mad people started runnin', that was the end of fun and
One nigga stand in b-boy stance, holdin' his gun and
Started shootin', pollutin' the curbside with shells
Yellin' buggin' out cause someone stepped on his Gazelles
Or Asics, whatever it was, money's beef was basic
It's tragic the way people takin' anger and misplace it
Now, mad are my peoples wearin scars and stitches
Cause niggas choose to play the role of actin' like bitches
Don't take it hard, if it's not you, act like you know
And all that unnecessary shit, just let it, go

[Hook]
Let it go, let it flow
Move on with your life and act like you know
Been on my last breathe, been between life and death
But I gotta let it go, can't deal with the stress
I let it, go let it go, let it flow
Move on with your life and just act like you know
Been on my last breathe, been between life and death
But I gotta let it go, can't deal with the stress
