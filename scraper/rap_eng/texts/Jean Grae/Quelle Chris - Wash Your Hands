All of them [?]
All of them customers
It makes not a difference
Could you please wash your hands

He's wearing a suit
He exits the stall and he's wiping his hands on his trousers
I'm sure you're important and making decisions of power

Could you please wash your hands
Before you return with your balls full of germs
Oh, oh, oh
Number one, number two
Doesn't matter what you do

Could you please wash your hands
Before you return with your balls full of germs
Oh, oh, oh
