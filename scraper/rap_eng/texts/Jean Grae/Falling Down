[Intro]
I watch sky
All in the mind

[Verse 1]
Marriage don’t last but it will never seem course
So she buried all the past like it was never before
It’s all battling the last thing never what you thought
Love I try to stop them from extending the knowledge
Possibly copying everything from her at 74
So love will never lose the faith oh
I want my active back bad
Daily it has been flying in the empty glass man
Back there with disappointment and stress
Still I need appointment apply it like an ointment
Before august fuck that thought
If you still supplying that arrogance fuck that mom
She on fluxed out dad not another dime
I wish the side of we because we don’t fear
See the top course bombing into Tedo’s grave
Whathinc your childhood heroes disappear like
Watching children fall to villain and
All criminal deacons on the floor
They will preach the wrong cause because there
Is demons on the wall when they crawling
Off the altar to the people

[Verse 2]
Now you thought you wake up in better places
You out here looking for leaders you the faithless
Out here looking for teachers and searching encyclopedia
You ain’t going to see it without the hard drive to do it
This ain’t no trick baby they on the safety they ain’t going to do it
Baby going to take the face to it
I know it and you know it
You ain’t know it concrete jungle
The unmark race for them
My people is another on me
Doubles going to take more rounds to
Solve these troubles
After that and you also know the key in the car
Over the night and the table will fuck it
Like believers number
Imagine that was tomorrow shit
I will get the map and we will leave our car on
We gotta be hitting the back of sorrows
So we just flip it back and leave the card on watch
Flip it back and leave the card on watch
But seen some things you need
