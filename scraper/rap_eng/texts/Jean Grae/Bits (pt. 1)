[Verse 1]
Mmmm... melancholy appeasement
Is better than the feeling in my head
I'm trying to lean towards betterment
I'm trying not to feel forced sentiments
It's kinda like the cinammon challenge
And everyone's like, "I can do it!", then you're spitting and off-balance
And balance is key for your battles, you ask me
The last three to battle me just balanced on asphalt
And that ass fell
But I as well, dry spell, desert
Cos I don't do invaluable endeavours
So I'd rather be present and president of my tail feathers
By my goddamn self, whatever
Clever, yes I am
My letterman jacket is the whole damn alphabet
The Greek-Roman alphabet
Heiroglyphs, Malkovich, climb inside my mind
And have some Alpha-Bits
Speak or do calculus [?]
Yes I have a calibre
I don't take phallus or [?] status
And not hummina-hummina conversation stamina
I mean common denominator chatter
Interests, teach me something
That keeps me wanting to keep learning to keep coming
Back for more, score, flaws, I don't see 'em
Like floors of mausoleum with the door closed
So leave your insecurities in your car or something
Or a bank safe, I dunno
Or hide 'em like Banksy
We can talk about 'em
Go 'head, see
I'm open to business, but it's never goddamn business time
Seriously
