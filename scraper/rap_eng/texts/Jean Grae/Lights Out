[Verse 1]
She's back once more with a flask in hand, bad ma'am
Damn hot like an Afghan
Just ask Ann
You'll get a bit of the mad plan
Observative work
And just ask like a TWIRP dance
At first glance
Miss Grae silent but dirty
Beneath the surface
Can't curve me
I'll swerve into you on purpose
Worth gold bars
Fort Knox
You're just worthless and I'mma
Permanent mixture
Fixture just like your favorite liquor
The picture of a sicker and thinner and lighter young Oprah
Not the visual though
You're thinking bigger
You don't know of it but so what
I'm gonna open up for shows now
This year
I'll be the close down
The clothes stay on
Nigga the flow stay strong
The hoes days are gone
And I toast with 40's all wrong
We walking long while you whipping your truck
And smashing bats to rims and screaming
We don't give a fuck

[Refrain]

[Verse 2]
I do not yell
I'm too cool for it
I let her move loud
Through on a jack chorus
Act lawless
I'll slap back your slack pectoris
Slick like The Mack
I talk smack shit, your facts bore us
Animalistic when I rip
Get your skin flayed off
I rhyme a hundred bars
You couldn't flip eight off
I'll rhyme to your heartbeat, stage in the car seat
Blaze hard from the corner
Gutter curb to the varsity
You'll hardly play it right
I never sleep
The day and nights all in the same frame of mind
In time, respect mine
Flexible mind
Can bend spoons with the flick of an eye
Dispense goons with a signal and sigh
So watch out now
I'm out now, better get inside
Like when the street lights came on when you was a child
I play your Mama hold a switch like I'm the Jackson family
Smacking your fanny
You'll get forgotten like your Rebbie or Randy
I'm rotten

[Refrain]
