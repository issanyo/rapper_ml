[Verse 1]
A nigga spray my ashes
Where the pall bearers with
My casket doing the two step
The jungle bully get down get down
One single solitary flap to find a place
To put on the ground you can send the
Vultures from the clouds till they crowd
Around me like a falling army
Jean don’t get morbid on me cause
I can’t stop and we got the base of profit
Don’t stop silence relied on myself to find
The lions just another human being but the
Thoughts dying out when is the flower out
When does the hope die hear my doubt now
Just fired out heart stream violent and quiet down
Where we use to hearing choirs where it’s quiet now
Where I use to get inspired and just write it down
Two names in the middle and the end man
I don’t buy it now tired of  browsing of battered cows
Want the house in martebra right grapes childhood
Prices pull the margin on my face like its was just a
Suggest tyrese was in depth of giving advice please
My higher goals have never been to fly alone
Getting shot down like friendly fucking fire fuck alone
So there it is in plain terms laymens
So I sailed my self on the boat I’m in fucking Caymans

[Hook]
Maybe I’m waiting for the morning
And I’ve gone too far often
I’m going to throw down again
I’m going to throw throw throw
Since I was 15 I have been waiting where is he
Who the white guy
That only happens in fairy tail
My head hurts
Do you ever think that we are the white knights
And we are the ones that have to save ourselves
That is so depressing

[Verse 2]
I vow to never kill again
Scare of cops spin a friend
I grabbed the murder weapon I’m off the grid
Wrap it up buried at the den the movies make it seem so cool
Well life really is a sitcom for fools
Should like to coat over debate I’m like yea
Stay true to the program even though I know
I hate them it’s the same
Ah to bear some young ladies is a pain
We remain lonely until we remain for
The rest of our day like longest star
The oldest story in the book
What a goof it’s always nice until you get to the
It’s missing just right now
No future now first it is self now
Them I’t you of all these fear these everlove
Of all this love while I’m up on the lope hole
Scared scared there’s a terry in place to be
I got people that do some other terrible things
To me another ice cream and A terrible place for me
These dreams left a whole lot stream for me
I think I know my place in this rat race
I need to just call the quits and say thanks
Who finished last is the realest of the Illest
And I keep them running and together they are
Given a name

[Hook]
Maybe I’m waiting for the morning
And I’ve gone too far often
I’m going to throw down again
I’m going to throw throw throw
Maybe I’m waiting for the morning
And I’ve gone too far often
I’m going to throw down again
I’m going to throw throw throw
