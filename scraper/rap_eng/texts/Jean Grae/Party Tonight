[Intro: Dres]
Shake it up

Shake it up, shake it up, shake it up, come on
Shake it up, come on, shake it up, come on
Shake it up, shake it up, come on, shake it up Shake it up, come on, shake it up, come on

[Verse 1: Dres]
Yo, I'm only trying to party tonight, I can't play
My shorty will be up in the morn', I can't stay
The party's rocking lovely indeed, yo DJ!
Turn it up, you know it's nothing but love on replay
I'm only trying to party tonight, I can't rock
Although they breaking day from the Bay to Bangkok
They talking 'bout the Sheep on the block
The band's hot
I guess we all addicted to fun, can't stop
Tonight, I'm trying to take it beyond a two-step
My chicks hype, body type be, acoustic
With friends, from a fantasy night, never ends
So you know it don't stop when the party descends, still
I'm only trying to party tonight, you ain't know?
I got to catch a flight to a yacht, I can't go
No bueno, got some people to see, see?
I'm only trying to party tonight yo, that's me

[HOOK: Dres (Jean Grae)]
(I've never been a fan of the one night stand)
I'm only trying to party tonight
(I've never been a fan of the one night stand)
I'm only trying to party tonight
(I've never been a fan of  one night stand)
I'm only trying to party tonight
(So can we do it again? 'cause baby this is the jam)
(I've never been a fan of the one night stand)
I'm only trying to party tonight
(I've never been a fan of the one night stand)
I'm only trying to party tonight
(I've never been a fan of  one night stand)

[Verse 2: Jean Grae]
I'm only trying to party tonight, cause I can
Ain't tripping if they're slipping or riffing with my man
I am, be the chick who be stepping it all night
Sipping on a fifth before jetting, I'm alright
I work too hard to not party the same
Do not pardon my frame when I bother your dame
With lock-popping my arms
Sorry I'm a hard damm dancer
In the middle of the floor
(She's the bomb, can't stand her), I know
I shake it like the bartender making my, drink
I'm a lady though, think before you play me close
Party-on further than Wayne Garth
Harder than Richards Keith on his main dose
High! It's Jean switching her hips, not Shakira Something terrible, hear me, I'm incredible, yes!
Please Dres leave her some tips, 'cause at the bar
I'm treating her, we leaving here with, so let's get down

[HOOK: Dres (Jean Grae)]

[Verse 3: Dres]
Yo, I'm only trying to party tonight, I ain't sprung
Elated, I'm a product that be Native to the Tongue
Related, I'm the object that equated to the sun
Just trying to teach the words to the songs you ain't sung
Like, I'm only trying to party tonight, so let's go
The world is waiting for us, there's a purpose to the flow
So bro's give a pound and sis get besos
'Cause love is all around, we mixing pesos
I'm only trying to party tonight, yo get fixed
We chilling, chicks are chunky, getting blissed off the licks
Take her to the dancefloor, get her hips in the mix
And if you, ain't 'bout a good time, then kick bricks
I'm only trying to party tonight, yo please trust
If shorty rub up on me with that booty, I'mma bust
Money hit you with the "Who he?" Before he get a fooly
I'm a New York City throwback, and the tooley is a must but?
