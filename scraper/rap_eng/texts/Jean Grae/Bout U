[Verse 1:]
If I told you last week,  every second of the day
If I don't got a clue, would it be
(Baby yeah)
We love you sometimes [?]
Baby yeah
(You may think) You think I'm funny
Like every time I get around you
I just got stuttered in my speech
(Baby yeah)
And I can't stop thinking about you
But you still stay out of reach
Baby yeah

[Chorus:] [x2]
Can't stop fucking thinking about you
Can't stop fucking thinking about you
Can't stop thinking about fucking  you
Can't stop thinking about fucking  you

[Verse 2:]
If I told you  I still [?]
(Baby yeah)
We all need something inside [?]
Talking into you
(Baby yeah)
Now wait a minute (you may think)
You may think I'm playing [?]
I can't stop talking in my sleep
(Baby yeah)
Cannot stop fucking thinking about you
But you still stay out of reach, yeah
Baby yeah

[Chorus] [x2]
