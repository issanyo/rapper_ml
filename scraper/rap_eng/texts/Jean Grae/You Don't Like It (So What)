I hear them screamin', want me back, oh
I thought you didn't believe in me, I was wack, oh
You want the in between Fellini, white and black, umm
Well I don't know I feel a way, about your ac-tions
What can you offer me, apologies
Security, amazing publicity
Or cult-status obscurity
Cause I do nothin' for the purity, the love
Get the fuck on with that, this ain't nothin' but maturity
Don't go get your white gloves to deal with it
Grown ass woman who's no prone to fearin' shit
Piss up in your snow cone jackass, so here's a tip
Don't eat the Grae snow, go fix your face bro
I swing my mace low, I don't mean mace, no
Gogo Yubari that Crazy 88 flow
No folks, your army brats made in a place so
I'm really not afraid of them, I'm Project Mayhem
I'm complex, based on an abominable case study
Based on phenomenon in space, buddy
Take that, take that, Diddy
In yo face, Eddie, turn the lights off, Teddy
You are not a beautiful snowflake, Chuck
When the goin' gets weird the weird turn pro, Hunt
If we gonna use quotes then step your quote game up
Hit the sample, Hit Girl, okay you cunts

I'm like Judy Blume with uzi's
You're like Jacques Costeau exploring in jacuzzis
Oh wow, you really got deep there
Three feet, whoah what a fuckin' reach, yeah
OMG can you even come back up for air?
ROFLMAO, no one really cares
I'm at Waffle House, deep, picking Cher "Do You Believe"
On the jukebox and dancin' on a chair
My sleeves rolled up, I dont give a fuck fam
I'm me so what, me Jeanius, damn
Fire bad, rap good
I'm the entire back row of the class
Would you please stop trying to teach me
I'm past it, advanced Regents smashed it
Peed on it Kelly, Kelly, Regis, Justin, Kelly, Kelly, Zacked it
You might not get it, rewind it, get active
I spin spit different, hipster arachnid
Specifically classics, but consider me average if
I'm mentioned in public, cause you bound to be clowned
For includin' me in your rap list of
The top motherfuckas who ass kick
Not that the statement's not accurate (it is)
Just that motherfuckas need to face the facts a bit
Your favorite rapper's favorite rapper, nigga, handle it
New York, west side in the 20's, Chelsea Handler shit

Looooooord have mercy
Yup, just wasted four bars there
You don't like it, so what, I don't care, nope
I can afford to waste bars like it's healthcare
In Amer- oh fuck it, I failed, yeah
All hail the prevailin' queen of fuckery here
Crown tilted to the side, and finger fuckin' the air
Upchuckin' a beer, leg humpin' a stud
Gun tucked in the rear pocket, duckin' the fuzz
Wait, I don't carry no guns, double negative

[Outro]
Um, I, I really don't have any guns on me, officer
Um, it's just, it's a rap song, and uh, sometimes
When you say that you have guns in a rap song
People don't want to come and get you?
Um, but I understand that, uh, sometimes you may shoot yourself in the club
Uh, so I do not have guns
You may search me, and my friends
And also let us go
Thank you
I obey the law.  Obey the law, guys!
I'm going to go have a drink
Not drive, just drink
