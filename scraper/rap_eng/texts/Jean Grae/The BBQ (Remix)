[Hook]
It's like that y'all (That y'all)
That y'all (That y'all)
That y'all (That y'all)
That y'all (That y'all)
It's like that y'all (Like that y'all)
Like that y'all (That y'all)
Bitches and that's all

[Verse One][Eternia]
This is our liberation, been patient, sick of waitin', attack 'em
The show and prove or shut up and just do you type of anthem
The Pam Grier make you pull the shotgun, point it at ya
Don't let the look fool you, we still... Blast 'em
Blow you off the stage, off the page that you're writin' on
Reprogram your fake friends, ghostwriters tag along
Didn't wanna go there, you forced the hand and wrote the song
And so I did, warned your relatives that be the death of Dawn
Cut the tongue and say there are none, we are them
We offer you an alternative, all feminine
All-star representative, all perspective
All nation, a global champion, call it the [???]
All elements, all natural, it's effortless
Do you see the words that's formin' all my sentences?
Check all the weapons as they check out
While you sell out to corny executive types with they checks out
We balance the books and bring the best out
Mega city resting in Queens with manservants in the guest house
Mapquest the destiny, best route
This is the last call, so figure it out
It's like that y'all

[Hook]

[Verse Two][Tiye Phoenix]
I'm sick of these average Joes bloggin', weak flow joggin'
I'm a godsend cuz I'm the fittest, no Darwin
My flow is arson, toss you all in a box
Murdering 'em unexpectedly like carbon monox-
Please give the goddess her props, I'm better than these Jezebels
They need to hire better writers like SNL
They want me calling names, I won't confess and tell
I let the drama build, and watch the pressure swell
See, my ammo is I damage 'em with poetry
Damn it, I will put that on my mammories and ovaries
While you stammerin', puffin' your cannabis from overseas
I'm blam-blamin' 'em, lyrically handlin' 'em soberly
So take a breather, don't challenge the mamacita
Flowin' harder than fellas on Cialis and Levitra
My style is either, nobody flowin' this ill
Lyrically I'm Manny Pacquiao, cold ya grill

[Hook]

[Verse 3][Jean Grae]
Still the best-kept secret on the bill, the thrill's real
The hype's right, the prophecy fulfilled
The weaker knife fight until ya pipes leak
You just a pipsqueak, a shit stain (You weak like)
Vengeance and many in legendary and didn't like
The Warriors, spit game, the chicks who rip mics
Embedded with big spikes, inflict pain on tracks
And stay on track while y'all laid-off and laid on backs
(This is the main hall) Not a practice space
Get back in ya place, we master space, your fans
Only use you to masturbate, that's not my job
This isn't a sex tape, my ten day rockstars
Lockjawed pop-tards, retards, I suggest a detour
When you seein' these four, reach for your knees, lord
Wait for it... Crash boom
One less damn fool

[Hook]

[Outro][Eternia]
That's how we do
Two thousand and ten
Jean Grae, Tiye P
And me, the E.T., Moss on the track
Fat Beats in the house
DJ Jab in the house
We going down in history
Do not forget us
We do not end, let's go
Come on
We out
