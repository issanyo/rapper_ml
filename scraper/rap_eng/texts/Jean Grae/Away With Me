[Refrain]
Oh I will take you away with me
As far as I can
Every sky would be blue
Long as you lovin' me

[Verse 1]
Listen, the world could explode, for all that I care
Cause I'm alone with you
Think they could clone you too
May be too much but I'm willing
I put my money on it
You think I'm crazy, right
You make me lady-like
Like, wanting to wear lace
Wanting to say yes
To giving into you, intimacy is painless
It's easier to keep running than switching faces up
Ok, I'm stuck, do you hate me or what
I wanna date you, go steady and wear your letter pin
Or your letterman sweater like Ola Ray but I'm hesitant
Not you, it's me now I'm a cliché
Wanna bend plié for you flip positions as a clié do
Just gotta relay truth I love to be together, breathe together
Jean say soothe
We could be forever
See whatever we make bloom
Just afraid I could be playing out a replayed tune, look at you

[Refrain]
Oh I will take you away with me
As far as I can
Every sky would be blue
Long as you lovin' me

[Verse 2]
Attention span was A.D.D-esque
Before we met, on occasion was frequent
I know how deep I get in emotional reconnect
I'm bring up baggage like conveyer belts and leer jets
Or bellboys at the telly, we chilling in till noon
Revealing the city below us, incredible views
We're feeling the feeling below us, I'm intending to
I've never felt this safe I gotta hand it to ya
As the phrases escape
I'm breaking hand quiver
Must be candid lust there's no damaging, plus
Be no standards in love be lust, yes
What's best for me never seems to ever be what's next to me
Exception, you
So excuse me if I question too thorough
Or keep you waiting, I might
Break down, shake defense off
Change mind, change clothes and take the weekend off

[Refrain]
Oh I will take you away with me
As far as I can
Every sky would be blue
Long as you lovin' me
