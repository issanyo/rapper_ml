[Verse]
Portrait priceless, splendor my agenda is cake
Niggerace thoughts down town drape like the ice vendor
My performance is purple haze falling out the sky
Words of Woodrow Wilson captivated consultants
Cash corporate the last sorceress
Blast the toaster, henny splashed all over the coaster
Trendy ass niggers get ghost quick
Screw face haters, hate the way a nigga hustle
But it's in my culture
I work the muscles and the work room, rigorous weight lifting
But still I hold the gavel in the court room trip
I hold the chips, blow zips crib sticky shit
Fix y'all niggers mouth, dare y'all to speak against
The laws of which you came from
Don't forget the name of brutalic rap niggers who brainstorm
Young to the AGE you might've seen me up in Roscoe's
Number 19 for that rice and gravy
Hold the bar two times a lady chemistry create a beat
My attribute, grandfather clock ice plated ice to Asia
Nights of Tunisia
Spanky white everything hopping off the beamer, two seats

[Hook] x2
Fuck you, fuck you, fuck you, hold up
Fuck you, fuck you, fuck you, wait, nah
Fuck you, fuck you, fuck you, ok
Fuck you, fuck you, everybody

[Verse]
I got an all-star collection of ratchets
Multiple shells, multiple cells
To this brown out, drown out 21 cannons
My name ain't in the stanis but I'm a fiend in the hood
Say needs in the hood, with the wood to smoke
You laugh when you figure the math it's like Baghdad
And back to the BX but they still call me the X
3 X hood cook a cellar aye y'all
With the shell catchers much more being on the stretcher
The dark falls, but sunny skies turn gray
Jean would only want it that way, okay
I'm the el capitan, what's fucking with that
Well all my dogs don't speak they all brrraat, brrraat
Son got smashed through the top of his hat
Laid out in the street in the spot where he sat
Always bragging about how he living fat
Now he's in he box, look where a nigga at

[Hook] x2
Fuck you, fuck you, fuck you, hold up
Fuck you, fuck you, fuck you, wait, nah
Fuck you, fuck you, fuck you, ok
Fuck you, fuck you, everybody

[Verse]
Stupid I break your pectoral breast plate open
And leave your chest soaking in red
While I'm smoking a Marlboro Red
Thoroughbred kid of a gun, next I'll spit in your lung
Then misalign your jaw, your teeth, and your tongue
I'm stuck to violent thoughts like the track to violent chords
React all out of sorts like a MAC in the hand of the law
Handling all y'all with a TAC that attack broad
You're like a Gap store package with wack product galore
I whore you, all you, kill and reanimate
Then slice you with a scythe through your physical database
Until your glimmer of hope's gone
I prolong your fate until your faith kicks in and kick your face in
Soliloquy and Jean at only 65 percent
Still murder 'cause I go further every time I vent
I love everybody, nope just kidding
I'm prone to having visions of slugging everybody
Pedagogue rap demi-God pocket of pennies
Lock it down like I'm Annie with a shot full of henny
You saying quackery rap
I keep it black like a jet of pan-Africans
With Marcus Garvey flying 'em back
The fist raised cause dismay disarrays steps
Like a switchblade stuck in your side fucking your innards
Jean Grae bringing a new era, fuck the name
From now on refer to me only as Hera

[Hook] x2
Fuck you, fuck you, fuck you, hold up
Fuck you, fuck you, fuck you, wait, nah
Fuck you, fuck you, fuck you, ok
Fuck you, fuck you, everybody
