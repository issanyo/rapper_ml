[Verse 1]
Look man everybody just chill the cops looking
And at the same time just be cool all of you just be cool
Bitch I’m taking calls no small talking
Author out the basement somebody dog walk them
I’ve been mr. MC since Chris Walken had a watch up his ass
Now I talk trash as I gain small fortunes
I've had shitty times yet I’m still getting mines
Everything is awesome misery loves company
So Cathy met Norman when I’m done performing
People go listen to Tanya Morgan Katherine who’s apple
Know master Ace though a legend still dropping
I’m just carving out the place rapping a new chapter I
Huge out space where alien choose knocking
I do not record a case I sung while sam son do
I rise moms and the moms and the moms do the newbies
I won’t be in Billy Berg juicing my dad starts shooting
The cops came I’m the main Lugant
I’m heading for the things I’ve only seen in my dreams
Since mama gave birth to the 2015
And yes I get scare for 2016
Crown king while you at home making meal

[Verse 2]
New nickname 38 special the wildcard
I told them porta medals is the only men that will cry
Fitted with 6 laps long agents and 5 brows
Senegal peddy gol and it can make lines crawl
Mythical monster monster rap menital
Momma was a renegade renaissance repping broad
So I bend low skip line if he knew he said he ball
Hit lines they competitive and it cause
And then it’s nine come and then amenity gone
It’s a small spirit but it’s all been for me to be barbaric
Work with my pallbearers with you all steering
Remember I was the fore mother before an era apparent
I represent the music outcast never a spit legend
It just happened hit the fine sound on the boston
I show what the sound like at the same time
They all call for wrong things you can get your horse
From next door then hit the panic button when I’m playin
3 laying porn man lowing jam that I made now finish

[Verse 3]
Yo yo you all slack you all locals when I rap ya’ll vocal
I’m a Black guy noble that king go soulful
Mr sling sling local wise words is don’s work
My Prides hurt my prides verse cops perk
While worth but it is worthwhile ain’t it B
Picturing picking you be guess which frame fit
And he quit do the math and when he subtract the subpart
And add me to the playlist fake fans favourite
Afraid of it afraid my rhymes sting supreme
See I leave a grey page you gotta go slane
See I’m like santa when he stands up for the rest of us
This is festive I’m scandalous and we stand so we can celebrate
That mark it’s that a sending in for sure I took
That metaphor too deep I made it far

[Verse 4]
Hard bars drop full of hard R’s
The dream is what we fending on
And I’m going to guard hard
Scared arms for the strong
Go hard and I haven't checked my phone since
The song started the snapchat showing back facts
Nash cracking tacks and I guess I need to end this
I’m way too distracted
Fuck
You know one of the hottest hottest items today
Is run DMC Beastie boys is rapid
Alright that is raid
You know there’s a story involved in something and A
Whole lot of novice that was obviously involved
And we are going to be having a whole lot of fun
We going to have a bit more rapping
Plus we are going to check out what’s happening
In our make up room with our make over
Don’t go away it’s rap and what is rapping
Let's have a look before we go any further rapping
My name is sex and baby come on don’t give it up
