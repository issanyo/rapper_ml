Have you ever considered using your inner monologue
Have you contemplated deep in your words inside your craw
Think about it, think about it, think about it, just think
Think about it, think about it, think about it, just think

I don't know if these new things, they're called thoughts
It's sounds crazy, maybe just hear me out
'Cause I don't wanna hear you anymore
Think about it, think about it, think about it, just think
Think about it, think about it, think about it, just think
Think about it, think about it, think about it, just think
Don't gotta say all of the things inside your mind

What type of response were you expecting from me
Watching everyone look before

Wha-, what? When did I get ugly? I'm ugly now?
Oh, well guess what though
Hey
(Oh, I'm still the same)
Nothing's changed except you
Hey
(Oh, I'm still the same)
Yeah, I'm still slappin'
Still the same, still look exactly the same
I'm still on my way to do [?]
