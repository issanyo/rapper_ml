[Hook - MeLa Machinko]
See I can be the bridge that takes you home
Or I can be he wind that makes you moan
Depending how you treat me baby
See I can be the beacon, brings you light
Or I can be blacker, colder than midnight
So how you gonna see me baby

Now either you can go on and choose me
Or baby you're gon' go on and lose me
Cause I can be, I can be, I can be, I can be
I can be, I can be, I can be, I can be

[Verse 1 - Jean Grae]
If I could be blatant with, well, what I gotta say about you and I is
What I gotta do to not see it Kevin Smith way
You know, View Askew, babe
Give it to me straighter than a hetero, I'll pay for petrol
We can go riding through the metro (polis)
Put it together because separate causes, misunderstanding, watch
Metropolis
That's like us, see together we marvelous
Hard as the city of the concrete gardens
Split it up, inserts the margins, you get confusion, the words lose purpose
The mark and the target, the arc and the aim like a dart just miss position
If I can explain the way we need to go and where we gonna go, I can do it just like this
Listen
I guess this is the infamous, "What is this really?" conversation
Man I hate as a miss is this it's me bringing it up
Predictable dating
But you won't, I've been waiting
I wouldn't bother, wouldn't have the patience
It would be the aphid in the room, wasted breath, but I think you're amazing
That being said... (dot, dot, dot)
Love the way the bed rock non-stop
Love the time we spend, chill, eat, shop
Even iller the days we pretend we wanna be at our own spots
But then you knock, knock, knock
But yet still not confirming lock
I need to know or else just get dropped
Get canned, get blocked
Got plans, or not?

[Hook - Jean Grae]

[Verse 2 - Jean Grae]
The way you think is appealing I
Like the feeling of thinking of you
Like to know that you're thinking of me
Like the feeling of being us, two
Might reveal how I'm feeling too much
Might be feeling the fear, we do rush
Fight the feeling to flee, to lose us
Type to reel in the scenes and lose trust
Slice the dealings and leave, abuse lust
Cuts and bruises, I see you lose love
But you chose to redeem it, who does?
Fuck the blues and the demons, choose one
Human to humor cupid with some "cue in the music cupid shit"
Come
Lose the race in the shoes that you run
Fuse the pace of the two into one
