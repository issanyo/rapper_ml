[Chorus]
(Baby) Yea, though I walk through the valley
In the shadow of darkness, praying to God heartless
(Take me) Wake me up, don't forsake me
(Take me) I pray hard, don't leave me waiting, please
(Baby) Yea, though I walk through the valley
In the shadow of darkness, praying to God heartless
(Take me) Wake me up, don't forsake me
(Take me) I pray hard, don't leave me waiting, please

[Verse 1]
Oh lord, I'm having issues, more deep than American missiles
Shooting commuter planes and filing emissions official
I've hit depression hard and started to pick at the scabs
From the scar, I'm a mess addressing pain in a bar, I confess
Cause all the rest just mar shit, chest in a cast
Feeling urges just to test out a casket, bless me I'm blasphemous
Jesus pass the fifth, I... have to get lit
Masochist self I'm only half of the health I was born with
(Baby) Save me, take me up high like 'dro
But way far past the stars and the sky
I'm blinding pain like I'm a junkie shooting up with
Emotional novacaine, I'm floating provoking the angels to jump me
In layman's terms, faith's been blurred, even early
I scratched crayon in between the holy word I pray on, but still
(Baby) Three gone, and maybe I'm in barren land
God help me, I'm having trouble with your master plan so

[Chorus]
(Take Me) the shadows of valleys of death, God
(Take me) when I'm shooting, taking last breaths hard
(Baby) I want to walk through the valleys praying lord
Will you help me, save me God, won't you tell me, tell me
(Take me) Cause I'm losing my faith, bless me
(Take me) Cause this world just wanna test me

[Verse 2]
You see this dirty knife on the floor, this chrome nine in my hand
These foul thoughts in my conscious, constantly understand
See we taught to believe if you can touch it and see it, it must
Be real so go believe it. But I've never seen Jesus
I've never seen God, so he's only a thesis
And I'm questioning all these things in my time to depart
I know it's written suicide is giving hell and devils privilege
Only wicked heathens commit it, sin of ages, well fuck it, bring it!
Lately I've been waking early mornings screaming
"Save me," dreams of seven horsemen chasing Jean, hastening speed
So I'm raising the barrel envisioning marrow
Splashed on the wall and polka dotting all my apparel
And maybe, Ginsu blades through skin will slay
And split thin veins instead of loading clips that spray
And if I'm meant to stay, then I'll just pass through the gates
And fall a long way back to Earth, so why don't you just

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
You can see the pain twist my face from a distance
The body's windows glistening red hot from all of the indo
Thinking of my next of kinfolk, my mama
Opening doors, crimson billows spread out on the pillows and floor
I gotta block it out. I'm set on knocking out
Lock and aim and I'm dropping my frame quick when I pop in the brain
And if God's omnipotent, will he slip in and change
And move the pistol so it shoots out of range and the lead whistles?
(Baby) Maybe he's just playing; it'll ricochet
And cripple me strictly for questioning, give me life to the pain
Sickle-shaped body bent in the middle
So little kids who pass me harass me and giggle
My figure's itching to touch on the answers
Hard-headed like exotic dancers' nipples
Picturing the bullets ripping the skin on the mantle I'm holding
Pull back and blow the wick right off the candle
Throw a kiss until the world's out of focus
So now (take me)
