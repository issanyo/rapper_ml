[Verse 1: Jean Grae]
See every life brings a moment of intense hatred
Body inseminated with foul thoughts and ? patience
Most likely waited out, ?
Chasing the cloud before you start thinking of
Lacing a crowd of people with a round of bullets flying free
Visioning bodies dying in threes
Temperature dropping from 98.6 degrees
And their souls leaving their bodily shell
? flee the scene
Before the cops arrive and shoot you up until you rotting in Hell
I'm saying, I know that most of y'all relating
Even hatred flashbacks, are subsequently losing it
Niggas without guns are those who used to using it
With index fingers locked in trigger-pulling positions
No matter which category you fit in, listen
It's a dark day, cluttered thoughts like crowds on ? parkways
Try to calm your heart with spears ?
Your girl cheated on you with your cousin
Or she tells you that she's eating for two, and then you find out that she really wasn't
Your man hit on your mom, your dad dislocated your arm
For fighting with him when he knew he was wrong
Your boss fired you, the week before the rent is due
Your wife lied to you
Your husband caught him with a guy or two, you're trying to
Just not invoke the spirit of Satan into your hands
Do something you might regret, cause something has gotta ?
This demon is creeping up to the surface of your brain
Working overtime to plan escapes from running from your murder route ? nervous
I've heard it before, cause I've been there
Balanced on a thin line ready to topple at any time or anywhere
Anytime, anywhere
Anytime, anywhere

[Hook]
Cause love...
So difficult to live it up, just give it up
Let's switch it up to hate, let's bitch and fuss
You see cause love is based on trust
And I've been hurt too much to take that leap of faith
I'll wrap and keep it safe and save face
So say your grace cause we just don't give a fuck

[Verse 2: Jean Grae]
I can hear voices screaming of angels and devils scheming
To crawl up my shoulders and just duke it out
Throw it up, puke it out
The pit of my stomach is bleeding
The shit that I'm thinking is turning me green
And I'm losing it quick, confusing random people
Walking with niggas that I wanna get back
The slack of my stride is ?
My feet knocking on pavement like I'm cracking it in fours
My mental math is way off course
Columbus style, my dental work is fake out smiles
Hating myself for fading into the pit of the blackness
No anger management course can even switch a track of
Thinking I'm sinking in deeper, meeting the reaper, chilling
Sipping shots of tequila, while he's kicking it to women, where's the ether

[Verse 3: Black McCloud]
Breathe the sulfur, the brimstone
Fear and suffering alone
? and comfort me like Jim Jones
Recruiting clones and ? clans
The pick of the litter, ? follow the leader, then sinking in quicksand
With no particular plan, I'm just slick with a sinister scam
Politicking, promising to deliver the land
'Til they kissing the ring on the hand of the king
The gospel, spreading like a venomous thing
'Til my name in the tenements ring, generous with nothing
Greedy with the riches, for all the times I got
Beat in this business, cheating on bitches
Feeding the sickness, like a cancer eating at your skin
Leaving you titless, witless, only Jehovah would witness
Satan is grinning cause he's winning, loving the hatred
In this age where nothing is sacred
We covet thy neighbor's wives, under the covers, they mothers lie
Naked with they daughter's baby's fathers
In the wake of modern day harvest
Cities burn like Sodom and Gomorrah
The ? nightmares might occur again anytime, anywhere
Anytime, anywhere
Anytime, anywhere

[Hook]

[Verse 4: Pumpkinhead]
? gases that you breathing and dying
The heat of the night, the streets are bright with heat seekers in flight
Them patriot missiles that whistle and streak through the skies
People fight for their right to kiss their freedom goodbye
I don't love her, but I keep it inside and never speak of the times I cheated
I just beat her and leave her believing the lies
I'm trying to stop the leak in my eye
I cry for the weak who have pride, but won't see a piece of the pie
Who forfeit them to the system and let it eat them alive
Listen my mission is to sufficiently try
Not to lose a piece of my mind
And change to a deranged piece of a guy
And take aim at the ones that chain us by the feet and leave us die
And told us the evilest lie
To the people that fed them drugs in needles to get high
Conspiracy theory is clear to me
But when I speak, my people don't hear me, I'm getting followed by M.I.B
Constantly fearing retaliation for my revelation
I find myself panicking in a train station
My nation is racist, I hate this
I'm anxious to take this ? shit and blast my way out of a matrix
This world of fakeness is faceless, face it
Every life has its moment of intense hatred

[Hook]
