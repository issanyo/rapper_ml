[Verse 1:]
Ya big dummies, yeah
Jean rock a little girlie shit
That's why my nigga Tech be callin me the greasy pimp
That's why we gotta open bars, snatch tips and bail
Like Jeanie's on a date with fuckin' Dave Chappelle, hell

I always been cool
That's why I move
With a small razor
Taped to the back of the front tooth

That's why I dance hard
Jean, doing the running man in the middle of the dance floor
Game's so cunning

And that's why I'm so cool with restroom attendants
On request, they'll lock you in and hot jock your pendants
Knock, knock, 'til you're blue, like the Titanic necklace
Meanwhile, I'm outside tagging names on your Benzes

Then everybody but my peoples starts to file in
And that's when niggas get tired and start wildin'
And then the cops come through and shut the club down
And that's when I turn around and blame it on you, ow!

[Hook:]
That's why
You could never fuck with Jean
That's why
Y'all ain't nothin' to me
That's why
I don't give a damn about a team, nigga
I been running things since I came up on the scene, get down

[Verse 2:]
(This bitch spilled a drink on my clothes!)
See, that's why I told you not to fuck with hoes!
That's why I keep my business clean
I done dirt, trust, flirted with the burden of retarded things
That's why the weed only contacts like osmosis
And if I smoke I'll only do it in small doses
Prognosis
She's iller than these niggas the streets feel her
And so I keep a distance between me and the heat spillers

That's why there's no beef, only buzz
Won't stop 'til I reach MTV or bust
That's why you need me
Please believe me
God, Greasy could have gone these other hoes' routs too easy

That's why you should've known I was approaching fast
That's why I see you in the road and step on the gas
Hard like NASCAR, speed, and toss your weave back
And keep gunnin' 'til the fender dents your knees back

[Hook 2:]
That's why
You could never fuck with Jean
That's why
Y'all ain't nothin' to me
That's why
I don't give a damn about a team, nigga
I been running things since I came up on the scene, get down
That's why
You could never fuck with Jean
That's why
Y'all ain't nothin' to me
That's why
I don't give a damn about a team, nigga
I been running things since I came up on the scene, get down

[Verse 3:]
Alright, Jean is chillin'
All of y'all, chillin'
What more can I say?
Stop grillin' me nigga!

I get a drink and fill it with Stoli Vanilla
And paint thinner
And send it to your table with dinner

And that's why you should never cross me
Mark the back of your leather with yellow Xs so the target is clearer
That's why Jean snuck a fuckin' sword in the club
Start carving you up
And not miss a step, thank you

Compliments of the Grae Miss, her statements
Are blatant but I love her, God, I hate her placement
Hatred
That's why I'm on the motherfuckin' A-list
Make you lose faith
Like Biggie or a hundred atheists

Seek refuge, move like a bunch of Haitians
See, that's why I don't be coming out I lose my patience
Too cool and collected
Come boost, with a steady arm
See that's why Jean be out, quick, I get it? Gone
