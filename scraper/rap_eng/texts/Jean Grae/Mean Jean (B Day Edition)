I'm better than you (She's Jean Grae)
What else does she do (I don't know)
Well she will
Break your face
You made her wait
Way too damn long
You suck (Spirit fingers)
Take my time (Two thousand)
And take (and nine)
Your fans (Is going to suck for you guys)
And make them mine (You suck)

Hey, back at the gate with a red cape and a full flask
20 Red Bulls ready to thrash in this bull fight
You bullshite, bull ish, couple of bulldykes
See I got bigger balls, probably get bigger applause
The strapped on dick and balls is bigger, thicker than yours
Probably fit in your jaws while you licking it off
Think of all the liquor you're poured
Bottles infinite, models you scored
Limited models it caused
Bought pause in your court dates [?]
Reminisce about the whores, you hate to date 'em
The tours and vacations you buy tickets and take 'em on
Don't gag, take it all, relax your mind
Shake it off, go to a safe place in your mind
With your boys with your toys with an autotune
I don't know huh, you inaudible, don't talk with your mouth full
Don't you look adorable
Tears streaming down, heels leaning up, knees on the ground, meals streaming upwards
Upchuck and get slapped until your face hurts
Should grab your neck and slam your face up into the base word
Isn't Grae absurd, make you go ape ish
Till you swallow every word, I'm back in the game
Hail to the nerd
