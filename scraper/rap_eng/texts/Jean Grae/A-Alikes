Well if she rocks like a spitter, and she flows like a spitter
Then you know she’s a spitter, and she probably is
And if she walks like a spitter, and she talks like a spitter
Don’t floss please forgive her, she probably is
And if she writes like a spitter, hold the mic like a spitter
Pause boys, ain’t no gutter, you know that she is
And if she rhymes like a spitter, know she rhymes like a spitter
Who rhymes like a spitter, you know who it is

A burnt sky scorched the earth’s flesh
At the same time the murderous text arose
Like a phoenix with the glow of death
A poet two steps ahead like Noah just left
Mo’ and sex holding techs
No, I’m not what you’d expect

Golden pen, exposing men false
Like a fallen disciple, All in the bible
The cause is the calling haiku
The love of words language liquor phrased
Slang in Mecca raised skyscraper
Look a future brighter then your jewels of praise

[Hook]
This life must be what divorce caught be like
I fall apart right just to stay right
Call this caught like night calls to daylight
We a-alike see alike but you don’t hear me though (you don’t hear me though)
When everything else just don’t go right, even if we just pretend that we alright
Call this caught like night calls to daylight
We a-alike see alike but you don’t hear me though

For lack of better words, well that’s actually the worst
The vernacular must map first a path of better verse
Heads are cursed I rap backwards
Like a roll, backwards
Flip the same line another track yes, accurate

I’ve mastered it, fucked rhymed
Killed it’s father, bastardized it
Masqueraded, I roll drive by and patronize it
Must analyze it slow, mathematical
Crack addicts pull
My rock will take you high, like astronomical planes

The money changes hands this year
With this here lisp, you disappear
My bliss is ripping spheres of discs
The wax heatedness, bleeding black blacker
Dreaming of a Caddie, black leather seated
Beats banging, heat ?
Serial scratch Nina, police tracking us all
Side track ‘em in an alley and laugh at the law

You see my way of doing things is sort of different
Never resort to riffing
I just snuff and keep it stepping, listen
Heavy stomp like I’m gravity in hand smashing the floor
Splashed jagged, shrapnel slap in your jaw
I’m like Bill’s wife packing a sword
You must be outta your gourd
The girl’s insane but I told you before

[Hook]

Irrational thoughts often, but find me squeezing the cork often
Competing with wino heathens to squeeze in a coffin
The alcoholic in me’s almost slaughtered like the traveling door to doorsmen
Who was found in doors with the foreman’s daughter Lauren
I freak a little forward, speak a little proper grammar
Rapper with the capital R, back with no capital
Fact is I’m hazardous, Angela’s hell immaculate
Poem’s rap like I’m in an obsessive compulsive cabinets
Neat but still dirty, elite but still worldly
To peak maybe at 30, I speak that I ain’t worthy yet
So grab your drinks and toast them up to the future
Jean’s a trooper so they say but I ain’t met no one truer

[Hook]
