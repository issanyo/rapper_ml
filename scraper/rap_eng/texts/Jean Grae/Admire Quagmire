Waste no time to kick the conversation
Man I'm hardly patient like minorities placed in
An ENR on the wait list, horribly blatant
Like I'm modern RnB I got seniority made
Lips spit game quicker, got no time I can play with
I'm a Rick James nigga give it to me don't say shit
Can truly be basement, red light
I might not make a move and be faithful
If you move with me graceful
Have you move in to Greyskull if you don't ruin the mood
And when we rude to get grave skull
If you don't catch it too 'cause I'm a feud and a faceful
You get canned up great updated like Facebook
Forget man's plans like hey look you stay shook as Ali
Michael J. Fox, Tone Wop and other infamous from mobs raps
Jean poppin' shit a lot, not
'Cause everytime you with the queen you dream of
Rocks being copped for the ring
Ring finger picture linger in your brain
Bring liquor with you if you wish to gain points
Not score, maybe I'll get my rocks off
And you can get lock jaw but Don no sleep I'm a rock star
Minus the coke, even if the finest still nope
I get my high on legally, frequently
Holy lines of dope require frequency
Don't you wish you could kiss her, up sticks your wood
When I kick a sixteen, no guy spits so good
Things you wanna ask me, hittin' on me backstage
Wishing that your speech had a backspace
Friends are like "You mad gay son, you fucked up badly"
If I had the floor, I murder all the fucking bag Grae
I thought I told you that Miss Jeannie was the anti-Ghostface
Not music I don't fuck fans no place
Here's a little woo too, for all you boys out there
You don't choose me, I choose you
And oh yeah, giggity giggity, Quagmire, alright
