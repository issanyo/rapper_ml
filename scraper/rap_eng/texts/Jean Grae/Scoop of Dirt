[Verse 1: Quelle Chris]
Ladies and crackers, niggas and gentlemen
The OC's original crudsters in the tenement
Antonio Vargas, flyguy chain big shit
High big spliffs, up the window, break the rental in
Trash laced with pizzazz, walk with the sane relate with mad
Q Chris, sipping on piss
The only thing neat is the Knob Creek
Q Chris, sipping on piss
The only thing sweet is the MD two zero backslash
20 mad dogs Mae Heathcliffs cross the street, Riff Raffs flag a cab
Catch me outside, how 'bout that?
I maneuver the game of life and mousetraps
Throw some crud on it, make the good snap back
Mike Epps, slappin' her fatty
Pulling her rat, yack

[Verse 2: Your Old Droog]
Spill my beet drink, and rub my stink feet on the laminant
Stalker fans, come through and examine it
Make songs with my fam and they jammin' it
Slap the phone out yo hand for Shazammin' it
Into a pile of vomit
Hip-hop Ahmet Ertegun
See me like, "Damn, Same shirt again?"
I don't care who act funny, tryna rank
If there's money in the motherfucking bank
And a tank full, Q can roll a dank like an ankle
We're thankful
Give praise to Puerto Rican Jesus (Ay, dios mio)
Rush straight to the mirror and squeeze puss
All I see is black heads and white heads
Keep my shirt on, not sexy enough like Right Said Fred
Strutting on stage with swamp butt (what?)
Hunchback posture and gut
Looking like the number 6
If I bend down might see crack like when the plumber come to fix (rancid)
With B.O. use cologne to try and mask it
Go so hard might blow a gasket
Singlehandedly lowering all the greatest rappers' caskets

[Hook]
Throw a little dirt on 'em
Sprinkle a little dirt on 'em (God bless)
Splash a little dirt on 'em  (R.I.P.)
Flash a little dirt on 'em (hehehehehe)
Throw a little dirt on 'em
Sprinkle a little dirt on 'em
Splash a little dirt on 'em
Flash a little dirt on 'em

[Verse 3: Jean Grae]
Fire off five shots and a maniacal laugh
Then point the six shooter in your stash
And run down viable paths for said bullet
Lex Luthor, mining your ass and then pull it
I'll give you a dirt bath, your forever home
As I tip in your body from back in the Hertz man
No one ever know (I keep secrets)
Heathcliff, double life without the rapes constructing like Hephaestus
If the reference lost, look up your Greek shit
Was the moniker, while Mmenoch's busy
I'm busier, shape shift Vivica A face
Manslaughter like friends of Monica
Fuck your Rachel, Phoebe, Ross chronicles
Khadijah Max, honest though
Hakuna matata, not now
Omarosa, not now
Vamonos, gotdamn
Feel like the Babadook in his top hat
On a rainbow float in a crop top
Take what you owed
Make it your own
Throw the dirt up on 'em, bitch

[Hook]
Throw a little dirt on 'em
Sprinkle a little dirt on 'em (just a little bit)
Splash a little dirt on 'em  (a little dirt for you)
Flash a little dirt on 'em
Throw a little dirt on 'em (you want some dirt, too?)
Sprinkle a little dirt on 'em
Splash a little dirt on 'em
Flash a little dirt on 'em
