[Verse 1]
Liquid content may cause you faggot's frames to burst
The same rhyme structure flamin' brain, I blame birth
The game switched-a made a retainer greater picture of lame dames that
Couldn't be felt with braille scripture
Even deaf kids are rockin' ear plugs
I rip you then stick you with sticks I dipped in arsenic filled jugs
I'm official you bitches. I ignite under certain circumstances
Flip back and have your ass kicked by backup dancers
Cancer chokin' the mad hatter the Jabberwocky of rap and hibernate in
Contemplate and now I'm finally back
The throat changed so hopscotch your ass back
I play close like a thong huggin' that ass crack
Verb pleat scab riddled permanent scars
Scratch deep like a cheap box of CD-Rs
Spread heat like I'm gia's drawers
Pleading the 4th in court like he's the boss then I carry you off
I'm more necessary than violence on the Amistad (Oh my god)
You grown like eating bacon on Ramadan
I'll piss on your shoes and make you clean em with your mouth
Then I'll tell all your friends I'll send Depends to your house
Must be crazy but the speed not to ya lady
File a DNA test so it's not your baby
(Maybe we can be friends?) No, just pretend
I slip razors in your charm bracelet; slit your skin bitch

[Hook]
Fuck you, fuck you, fuck you, hold up
Fuck you, fuck you, fuck you, wait, nah
Fuck you, fuck you, fuck you, ok
Fuck you, fuck you, everybody

Fuck you, fuck you, fuck you, hold up
Fuck you, fuck you, fuck you, wait, nah
Fuck you, fuck you, fuck you, ok
Fuck you, fuck you, everybody

[Verse 2]
Super enhanced survival shoot em with a crucial plan
Infatuated with music in loops, no scruples man
Phrase-ologist. Non-apologetic mutiliator
Stays all of this defaming names so they can sue me later
Hater, yes
The kinderst gas the fate opposer
Philanthropist, misanthropist, underground soldier
Banana clips just start unloading in your supermarkets screaming till your
Hoarse, bleeding, finding out that you're the target
Monotony flow, contradictory, word plays and like bringing Satan to a
Baptism in a flooded basement
Jean's out to lunch, she ain't even punched in yet
You're a facsimile, I'm the original document
All shock and then lights out drop em in. Selections are very buried
Improper things I'm married to rap like J.Lo to scandals
Light up a room like J. Hov's birthday candles
I'm that bright like Steven Hawking's computer chair
Asked out a teacher on a Sadie Hawkin's dare
Parallax you, see the future in my sleep
I'll battle rap you until your gullet starts to leak
Gnash your teeth and smash you then bind your feet
Thrash holes in your dome snatch your soul and retreat
Mad Max-ish the prose so dope it's fantastic
Now fold up your dough before you get yo ass kicked

[Hook]
Fuck you, fuck you, fuck you, hold up
Fuck you, fuck you, fuck you, wait, nah
Fuck you, fuck you, fuck you, ok
Fuck you, fuck you, everybody

Fuck you, fuck you, fuck you, hold up
Fuck you, fuck you, fuck you, wait, nah
Fuck you, fuck you, fuck you, ok
Fuck you, fuck you, everybody

[Verse 3]
Rush the door like a Russian whore
Mail order bitch sent to Dahmer's crib
It's an honor to split your armor blood drip
Like pulp fiction when bits o' bones get on ya
Shit, I just talk jargon disregard margins
Liquid date any enemies rap incarnate
I'm cynical, criminal actions excite me
My mic chords an umbilical that radiates high beams
Humorous, filled with more flow than a cumulus cloud
Dentist mad, he said my words abuse my mouth, so I upchucked em
Gut buck em out. Chuckle loud, duck down screaming fuck the crowd
Specialize staggered mixed malt liquor with jolt cola
Start drinking when cops start lookin' over their shoulder
Nastier than central booking sandwiches handling tough
Cranky in the morning after smoking the canibus stuff
Can't see it like Orphan Annie's pupils in the cartoons
Can't be it like tranny's who paid for implanted wombs
Nope. That's not it
Close but no cigar
Dutch lit but I'm passing it right past ya Paul
That's all, that's Jean the definitive minister
The sarcastic lip bar spitter competitor
The un-cosmetic duck shit on your pedestal
Sanitarium released, the most unforgettable
Motov dirt Molotov your face
Then lock you in a box and watch you burn in a closed space
Big face get your shit taken and replaced with a ticking case that's
Strapped to your waist
(Duh) You move to slow sloth boost your movement
Your mind counts time like down south screw music
Who's it
The Phoenix wings spread like an Ox said
I'll knock you out a window make you literally drop dead

[Hook]
Fuck you, fuck you, fuck you, hold up
Fuck you, fuck you, fuck you, wait, nah
Fuck you, fuck you, fuck you, ok
Fuck you, fuck you, everybody

Fuck you, fuck you, fuck you, hold up
Fuck you, fuck you, fuck you, wait, nah
Fuck you, fuck you, fuck you, ok
Fuck you, fuck you, everybody
