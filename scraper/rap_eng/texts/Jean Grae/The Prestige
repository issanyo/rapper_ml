[Verse 1: Quelle Chris]
I stay in front of the system like LCD
We got connections through waves like LTE
Like LB's brah, like Ice Cube, MAC 10 NWC
These Michigan J's been jumpin' since legalize weed, no WB
Hamburglar steez might gobble your trees
Can't be seated with rejects please toggle decease
(?)
Pissed off like hitting the seat
I've been waiting for a minute like missing a G
Why you listen to them all them niggas listen to me
We got muscle in every hustle Coco and Ice T
When I'm busting my strut don't rush it Jojo and KC
Ain't no killing my high, ain't no flow in the feet, I'm fly
Take 5 come home with some heat
They looking like rappers to you they like clones to me, asleep

[Chorus]
This party is bullshit
This money is bullshit
These labels is bullshit
These songs is all bullshit
I got a couple- and a couple and a
And I'm about to get lit, fuck you bitch
I got a couple- and a couple and a
And I'm about to get rich, fuck you bitch

[Verse 2: Jean Grae]
Rain J doctors, pterodact' wingspan
Beauty that's buried a berry a very the inn man
A tin can opener with my incisors
I'm sharper than diamonds
With you conjuror, ultra-violent, so confident
Ultraviolet lens and doing cross fit in a Gowanus warehouse
Trainin' for the apocalypse
Man, I'm not to be played with at all
Even on Adderall y'all still so slow
Come at me bro
But now with your keyboard, in person
Can't afford to nurse, you're social awkward, this a nurser
So shut the fuck up, shut the fuck up
And when you're done
Shut the fuck up, and shut the fuck up
In cursive
Merciless, simultaneous humanitarian
Syllables, syllables, 90's rap actual act
I'm Perseus, I'm fighting Calibos up in a stadium
Til there's just one of us, see what I lift
Those are hunt and attack
Bitch I'm [?]
Model, 3 bottles I've got o negro
One [?] I don't gotta live
I'm from the New York days [?] monolith
Pop in trains, gold chains, and a brass grip
Got cocktails, [?], a dollar slice
God damn, the 2 sky lines, I'm from Priceless
You're a one slice toaster, useless
You're a one night coaster, a lost loose clip
Jean's Bob Ross spruce trees, pond trees, vermillion
Cerulean, bajillion, the power ball jackpot
I'm prisms of colors, how y'all that not narrow
Minded, blinded, less a team member, arrow
I avenge nothing, kill on sight
Hold it down in place with blades at a pillow fight
With my zillow lawn and Uber into your hood
Exuberant as fuck, livin' my life as I should
You dunce, you want this
But he flick with Grae dialogue
This really well paced and I don't mean the damn ride along
Viacom, [?] walkin' through a firearms
No actual firearms
Just my fuckin' mind is on
Pop a [?] for revolution sites you on
And when you click 'em every X sets off a different fire alarm
Air raid sirens, your time is gone
Me and mine about to climb
Why you cryin', whats wrong?

[Chorus]
