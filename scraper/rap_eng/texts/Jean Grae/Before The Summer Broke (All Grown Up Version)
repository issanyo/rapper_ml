[Intro]
I spent about a half'a month
Thinking about the universal laws of karma, bullshit
And all that everybody really wants
To contrast to what they need will make you fuckin’ want to fuckin’ pull clips
From everything you’ve ever seen
Wind it back at half-speed
Just to find the part where niggas lied to you
So check my scene if it applies to you
If not, fuck it; turn it off, bye to you

[Verse 1]
But anyway, I’m back again
Hope you don't miss me, Black FM
Feet firmly planted in the clouds as always
A sack of dreams deferred, I'll leave em in the hallway
Don’t worry, you won’t have to see em
Coincidence you want the bars, I want my freedom
I guess this is the necessary lead-in
Before the scars, loss, boys, feelings oh gosh
Know when Jeanie be going in on her demons, how far
And not even revealing all the cards
I deal, I dealt with blows beyond the belt, pause
Shit that if I told you, you’d be drinking like myself, god
But I’m all right without a reason to do well, star
My Mama was the last thing I wrote the tales for
Inside I’m tailspinning down with napalm
Strapped to my brain and on my back a flamethrower
Oh, you love it, what you came for
I tell myself that, I don’t really give a fuck what they want
But they paying for it, so pay it forward
Try to think of it like that to save thoughts
I'd be like, I’ll be right back in the same song
Never return and leave the happiest of days more
Cause I don’t get what you be putting me in lanes for
It’s fucking music, what you giving it a name for

[Hook x2]
I’ve been sayin' everything’s going fine, just takin' some days off
Like everything don’t pay it no mind, been puttin' a face on
But motherfucker, I’ve been goddamn lyin', I’m takin' the grace off
To go back in time, before the summer broke

[Verse 2]
Well, I guess this is what I aimed for
It's fucking music, what you giving it a name for
I don’t get what you be putting me in lanes for
Never return and leave the happiest of days more
I'd be like, I’ll be right back in the same song
I try to think of it like that, but it seems wrong
Pay it forward, they paying for it
I don’t really give a fuck whatever they want
They love it right, it’s what you came for
I tell myself that, it ain't more
Strapped to my brain, on my back a flamethrower
Inside I’m tailspinning down with napalm
My Mama was the thing I wrote the tales for
I’m all right without a reason, doing well, false
Shit if I told you you’d be drinking like myself, god
How far I got in not revealing all the cards
Oh GOSH
Got Jeanie dishing on her demons
After the scars, loss, boys, feelings
I guess this is the necessary heart bleeding
You want the bars, I want freedom
Dreams deferred, you don’t see ‘em
Keeping my word, so no fleeing
Feet on the ground, always
You can’t stop the wheels of a lost day

[Hook]
