[Quelle Chris]
Courtney, this world is unfair
You should not feel so down
Courtney, you try not to care
You'll turn the day around

You're the most mundane
Exciting, cool, ignited, unsure, and confident
Real, implausible, possibly impossible, perfect you

So Courtney, there's no need to cry
You do the best you can
Courtney, they won't break your spirit
Each day's a brand new chance
