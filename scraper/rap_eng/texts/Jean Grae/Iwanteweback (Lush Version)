[Intro]
So dear, so me, so evil you
So we are so through
There's no need, it's over, me and you

[Hook]
I want you back
Sometimes I do
I want you
I need you back
I want you, boo
I want you back
I want you, boo
Though we ain't loving
We ain't fucking
We ain't through
I want you back
I want you back
Oh oh oh oh oh
I want you back

[Verse 1]
Sometimes I want you back just to adore you
But mostly I just want to destroy you
Store you, and call you Murphy as a nickname
Wipe the floor with you, you're addicting, dick thing
Insane to explain, I know it might sound callous
Careless, sadist, I'm a damn lady
My fair Jeanie ran on planes in Spain daily
Clearly, I'm fairly well-versed in fuckery
I should fuck you up for breaking up with me
Stain your frame of painted veins I bust with cutlery
It's such a shame that you think you're an accessory
You're so fucking pedestrian, especially when you're next to me
Excuse me, sounding too imposing
Fuck it, I'm first class -- I never said I was into coaching
You should listen closely, thinking the song's about you
It is -- you, him, him, and him mostly
Don't choose bad; at times, my choices do betray me
Belaboring the point, yeah, maybe I'm sort of faded
"I'll maybe call you later, baby"; Lord, you're hated
But Lord, of course I'm motivated, low-key hatred
Sleeping neighbors choose euthanasia
Stay together, trooping through the universe forever
I'd rather not be two sedated dapper cadavers
I'd rather feel the pain and tell you never feel embarrassed
It ain't baggage -- I claim baggage like a name tag
It ain't marriage if the gain came through the same fabric
Insane to remain average, I can't have it
My main habit's to change, it creates havoc
You can't fathom a love/hate relation, well
Yes you can, guess again -- you've been aceing them
Replacing them with lying to yourself or fifty pacing them like
Let's get through it, baby
And maybe I'm crazy then for being blunt
I know what I deserve, know what I want
I know that we could never really be a pair
I know that sometimes I still want you there
I might not like you, our connection's rare
I might just spite you, you're never there
I like revenge, I love love
I'm still evolving, that's some shit that Jean is not above

[Hook]
