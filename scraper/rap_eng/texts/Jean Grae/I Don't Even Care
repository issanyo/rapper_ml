[Chorus: Macy Gray]
I don't wanna be
I ain't gotta be
I ain't gonna be
And I don't even care
I don't wanna be
I ain't gotta be
I ain't gonna be
And I don't even care

[Verse 1: Jean Grae]
I mean, uh huh, yeah
I guess I could be what you wanted from me
If I was runnin' from me
If I wasn't honest
But see, when I was little
I made up a promise
Or wait, rather a premise
And that just prefaced everything
I've never been embedded in a mass cause, wait
Let me think back, nah
I think I said it right
I never considered this like a bed of feisty
The man I'm just better writer than a diva
I mean, I am a better writer than
I'd be a diva
Not aesthetically either and
I don't think of it evil, air quotes
The people and their folks need a hero
And a villain
But I'm both and neither
Dare most to reveal all the feelings
In the ether
With the glass jar
Her with the thin skin
Her with the mask on
My kid decision was living this
With the mask off
My middle finger cast off
I'ma leave the mask off
So fuck y'all

[Chorus: Macy Gray & Jean Grae]
I don't wanna be (and I don't wanna be)
I ain't gotta be (I never gotta be)
I ain't gonna be (Uh uh)
And I don't even care (I don't even care)
I don't wanna be (I never wanna be)
I ain't gotta be (I never gotta be)
I ain't gonna be (Uh uh)
And I don't even care (La, la, la-la, la)

[Verse 2: Jean Grae]
Yeah
It's not the censorship
Ten percent some mental shit
Ninety percent, the emphasis
It's just I don't care
I won't wear most of the clothes
You hoes wear
And I won't go to most of the shows
I don't fare
Being solo with scotch
And yelling YOLO with a spare glass
Toasting to myself and the ghost of my past
And glaring at
Cookie cutters over sharing
I'm over caring
You could find me over here
And it's apparent
That

[Chorus: Macy Gray & Jean Grae]

[Bridge: Macy Gray]
Hey
When you're lookin' my way
You'll be lookin' in space
Cause I am
I'm so outta here
I'm so outta here
Love
I only do it my way
And when they see me, they beg
Cause I am
I'm so outta here
I'm so outta here

[Outro: Macy Gray & Jean Grae]
Hey (I don't wanna be)
When you're lookin' my way (I ain't gotta be)
You'll be lookin' in space (I ain't gonna be)
Cause I am (And I don't even care)
I'm so outta here
I'm so outta here
Love
Cause I'm so outta here
I'm so outta here
You'll be lookin' in space
And I'm gonna do it my way
Cause I'm so outta here
I'm so outta here
We so outta here
I don't really care
I don't really care
