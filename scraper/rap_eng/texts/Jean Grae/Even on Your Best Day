[Verse 1]
Jean love to use her name as the intro
Begin slow
Pushin like a voodoo cushion pillow
Dawg, mush all y'all
Fuck shit we confusion calls
When I step through, protect your blue balls
Move small
Take steps approaching the apex
Broke, don't think twice of signing the fake check (nope)
You won't make nice
I'm tired of smilin'
The same girl they call to do shows at Riker's Island
I might wild this year
No longer a child
No rose colored glasses
Now it's just a violent stare
I'm a phenomenal diamond
With a mind that's glare
Except I was pocketed but he dropped it finally here
Could find me maybe where I'm marketed but dog it's rare
Who's only targeted and partisan
And no body cared
And I gotta watch the Barbies and the comedy aired
While I'm sitting in these offices and all of 'em scared
Then they folding and they shittin
But they ain't listen
Funny when you look inside
Outside of opposition
To sign the petition to get me signed
On a mission, on a grind
Fuck the wishing, had to leave it behind
They made an optimist into a pessimist with just time
The stupid motherfuckers Jean move shit with her mind
You should have known that nigga i'm next in line
Dressed in a throwback dress fitted throwin' a lime from the Patron shot
Head spinnin', sipping on wine
Outta control til the whole club's the scene of the crime
And then we screech off, geek off
Running police off
Til weed covers the seats and THC leaks off
And how the fuck I getta negro please
When speakin' truth apologize on your negro knees fucker
From baseball to Ruckus CDs
I lace nothing but heat
Your face dripping til it's touching your feet
And still I place nothing
Nothing to eat
You must be deaf, dumb and blind
Fuckin' hate man
One of the three

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
It doesn't make any matter now
I stand on the battle ground
With bloody hands splattering and chattering loud
Trust you can't put me back
I'm inhabitant town
Plus I got a little swagger and I'm adamant now
Just graduated the school of lack of patience
You only just received your master's in masturbation
Only a pro at crastination
You only gonna see the fuckin' future when the album bashed your face in
