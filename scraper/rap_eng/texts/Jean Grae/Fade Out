Someday when I see you, be with you again
Can't believe how I miss you, I'm there til the end

Demetrius I had to say something
My brain is stained with you
I don't even think I can explain how much I miss you
Your tears frame the page my fate is outlined in chalk
The other day I freaked on the street when someone walked like you walked
It took a second not to think it was you
And everything crashed down
I don't understand why god picks who he's gonna snatch out
Before you hit the ground I hope you passed out
I wish I could run up in heaven with gats, find you, and blast us out
I couldn't you brother, I heard he's with your grandmother
I spent two weeks on 411 trying to find the phone number
I didn't go to your wake
Got the call to late
And after I found out I spent a month in my room and never open the drapes
I didn't get to say goodbye - it's not fair
Hope you had fun in Miami, it seemed like you were meant to be there
My family talked about you often
I can't think of you in a coffin
Pardon the random thoughts
When I speak of you I get lost in memories
The intensity of losing you is like 1000 degrees in the desert
With no sight of water or trees
I dream of an oasis, seen you in a hundred faces
Hear you in music, pic you partying in different places
Like your favorite I guess, sometimes it snows in April
Your fate will never be forgiven, I'm cursing' every religion
My heart is always with you
And anyone that I love will have to know
A part of me can't go to them
Cause it's above..
I miss you
