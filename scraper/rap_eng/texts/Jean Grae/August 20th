[Verse 1]
It's a spiritual advice
So I’m always home
Like I took everything in
And that’s the coming home
I am here and because
We seen all the real things
And that’s what makes me different

[Verse 2]
August 2013 was sun filled
Shot through the atmosphere
With the running veil
Dropped through the sky and
Landed in my heart square
And possibly am not speaking
For physically here get the flow
With the full force of ask God’s
Hammer hot sauce that opens
Force like I argued on the forth
And elius on the koch arrow
With the cops staring with them
Blocks glaring rocks selling
Breath leaving me like it’s autumn
Caught up for this moment
But this feeling is falling off
Don’t know who I am in the
Moment I don’t know who I am
In the moment this voice keeps
Talking on

[Verse 3]
My spirit talks into a crawl space
Door left infloated in infinite all states
Undefinable anesthetic just coursed
Through me and  the person I thought
Would suit me sat across the room
I came through the glue and felt the
Fabric of my heart strings
Spitting hard disintegrating into
Dark matters but come start these missiles
As my soul spasmed  saw the God particle
Visible I can’t stand up as the darkness crept
Into me and my bond shadowed kept on
Losing it again and moving automatic
Washing dishes as my vision blurred
Robotic status mixing with slipping in bitches
On the mattress living bullet shot into my wound
And hit the skin and tore the way inside
And ripped my flesh apart and targeted my
Inner child left her on the side of the road
Bitch is bleeding out let my evening
Breathe it out

[Verse 4]
No time for dying
Just stay with me
So maybe seem to lose
You went to college
That is the way it was
And she say you should
Know your place she
Know your place and
You find your place
I know things that I
Was not supposed to know
I don’t like people who are
Listening and I really think about
What advice don’t know what
To do but I do nothing that I
Want to do
They want something from us
So you know what I use to
Just you know no one really
Gave a damn whether I was
Singing or not right
But I used the place
Platform and I went against it
And I said I’m going to sing
A couple songs every night
When was I introduced in 1963
