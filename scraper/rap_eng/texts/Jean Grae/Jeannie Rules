[Intro]
"I don't know, I dont really listen to that
I don't know, I dont really listen to that
I don't know, I dont really listen to that Jean Grae shit
She's like, it's like all underground and she's like a hippie. I'm not into that"

You retarded. That's what you got from what I said?
On what song? Fucking hate you guys!

[Verse]
When it's grown folks talking you should shush your mouth
I get aroused by you dramedy clowns
Don't bother me now, scram kid
Before I go Manson and your man's dead
Or it's a handsome ransom on his damn head, Pause
My paws grubby, greasy
Don't drink Riesling or Moscato, that's a dessert bottle
Stashed up in the purse vodka
Blasted in the afternoon, hostile. Trashed up in a fancy room ...
Hostels- You in
Impostors ruin, the movement of the realest motherfuckers that do it
But I'm Mama Large Marge, you're just Pee-Wee truckin' through it
Pursue her, good luck; I'm fluid as fuck
I move like a loose screw point, hunt
Fast and agile
Teleport rhymes
Nightcrawler while you're fragile, stagnant ballers
Don't give a damn about your dollars: ignore it
I don't give a damn about your problems: you're boring
What I utter, just utterly in the throes of the gutter and mixed with a dose of the beautiful struggle
And most can't handle it, Manga shit, animated English lit
Sing it ladies... (Jeannie rules!)
Greasy, yes, nice!

Greasy, nigga. Slicker than your average
Believe me, nerds. Thicker than your glasses
They teach my words in your frickin' classes
I'm a scholar and a lady
Kiss my ass, kids
