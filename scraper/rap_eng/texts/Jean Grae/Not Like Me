[Intro]
One dollar, not two dollar tips at open bar
Keep it that way
There's nothing wrong with partying
Get your drink on
Oh, who's that?
Oh that's your girl? You with her?
She look like everybody else in here

[Hook]
C'mon
They're not like me (That's a shame)
Baby bet you know they're not like me
And everywhere you go it's not easy
Just to come across a girl like Jean, oh no
C'mon it's not likely
And everywhere you go they're not like me (So what's up?)
And baby bet you know it's not easy (Uh huh)
Just to come across a girl like Jean
Oh no

[Verse 1:]
Pardon my composure
Saw you, had to approach you, move closer
Confidence all courtesy of the mimosas
Framed perfect
Like a picture with the sharpest image
From the lips of a cherub, cherry red
Henny breath, let me guess
Queens, is ya?
See Jean can read by the lean
And the tilt of the cap and your drink, I'll refill that
I need some good conversation, love
These hoodrats be making up the game
Plus they ain't even fully developed, I'm sayin'
See we could start a challenge
Of balancing most delicate matters
Involving plans, including satin and carriages... Wait, too far
Maybe we could shoot a little hoop
Or just chill on my stoop
I don't like a lot of hoopla
Me and you, sedude deuces and spiked juices
Some stoges, some backwards-rolled backwood in Cubans, that good?
So write your name, oldschool, pen on the back
Now what's a good time tomorrow?
I don't stall
Holla back

[Hook]

[Verse 2:]
You see I walk up different on 'em
Talk slang often
Bought dinner at dutch
While most women do the wallet clutch
Never ask the whip question
Make jokes interesting
Wear more clothes and let their eyes do the undressing
A little sarcasm, bar savage, tar addict
Argue about Reasonable Doubt and Illmatic
Car traffic eyein'
We can walk in summer laughing
Cry when they giggle
Split sides and curse
The magic that's in between us boy
Jean a fiend for the love-feeling
We crush dream and after lush green
And the sun shinin' and enough beach for a lifetime
And you're just mine
Pop in that Hathaway
Wonder and Gaye and rewind
Play a little chess strip
I read a lot
Beam you a little sixteen of something
I cook well
Sip on drinks and just chill
I'm malt liquor and M.O.P.,
Tell me what you feel

[Hook]

[Verse 3:]
See we could be for life, even
For nights breathing heavy and steaming
From polite greetings to late-at-night face-smashing
Taste passion and race place baggage
My faith asking to place faith back in and maybe marriage
I hate slackers
Jean love to chill and lay out
Sometimes stay out
We'll find an open bar
I'm not impressed by payouts
So star, display out your cards
We can splay out on the top of cars
And pick the constellations
While playing the best of the Bards
You're making me nod agreeing
Patience is all I'm needing
Face it, I'm not your average girl
Or just close to it even
Most original
Entranced by your physical plans
I've got a lot, but we could chill
That's all I ask
You down?
