[Verse:]
Hey, bring it on (and on and on ...and on, yeah)
I got a secret, it's a feeling that you want to put it on me
But you keep on playing
I'm on you like you were made of one big chocolate treat
Just for me, yeah
All night, all right my baby
What you, what you want tonight, baby
Baby bring it on (and on and on ...and on, yeah)
I'm on you like you were made of one big chocolate treat
Just for me
Yeah, (bring it on)
Whoa, why you play with me
I claim, (bring it on)
I got a secret, it's a feeling that you want to put it on me
But you keep on playing
Bring it on (and on and on ...and on, yeah)
Bring it on
