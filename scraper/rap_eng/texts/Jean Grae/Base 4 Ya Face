[Intro]
(Base for your face, London! Everybody in the house make some noise!)
(Base for your face x7)
9th Wonder
Lil B, BasedGod, Based
(Based for your face all day
Bsed for ya face, my nigga it's all -- yeah)
Brrrangdang, yeah

[Verse 1: Lil B]
This is real life from long nights
Niggas like me I bounce back it’s alright
Base for your face two times you don’t see no actin'
All they do is rhyme words, such typical rappers
I was defined by the struggle, metro phones
Got pictures of my partners that died, people like me
Cried a whirlwind came from drugs and guns
Used to call them cocaine numb
Niggas killas drive-by, the AK-47 took them little kids lives
All these young niggas, it's like a movie
Putting dots on they shirt, talking about Coogi
This is change, please excuse me I rep based world
Nigga, please don't lose me

[Hook]
Base for your face x8
Real complex rap
Yeah, I just speak, you connect the dots

[Verse 2: Jean Grae]
I'm a rabblerouser, the other rebels they crowd around her
To rebel levels are leveled up in the several thousands
Records house her like Africa read the jungle brothers
This is for townships, backpackers and seasoned lovers of music
Lil B's in love with the music
So leave a brother to use it, lead the public to new shit
See the puppets ain’t do it, you keepin' up what they viewin'
You see the numbers they doin', you feedin' us, the three of us
Plus 9th more than Kanye cuff dykes or cuff mics
This my nigga Phonte, Based God, the above types
Above the boundaries of music, the counter-culture groovin'
The kind of combination got you puzzled, Culkin/Kunis
We do what we like so hit the comment section
Do this for life, so what we got in Common, resurrection
We tryin' to bring everythin' back, man
Everything and that includes

[Verse 3: Lil B]
Swag
Remember times I was strugglin' off my mindset
Remember that time will fly like a caterpillar
Graduate, I ain't even know that I shoulda
Sometimes don't hate when you know I coulda
Now I'm about to give back to the people, more than ever
Livin' like now or never
Sometimes people get distracted by the outside hate
Life turned into appetizers
And I tell my niggas, be a man of your word
I be fakin' bottomless, fuck it sleepin'
Watch your sleep cause them suckas will trick ya, thinking about niggas
Don't change for nothin'
I go back niggas still swing J's and sufferin'
I'm moving up in the world, gettin' humble as well
Stupid motherfuckers can’t tell this real B

[Hook]

[Verse 4: Phonte]
I'm back on my shit, pa
Back on my incline, Phontigga raisin' the benchmark
The young lions gave me a kick start
So here it is, pyramid schemin' on y'all niggas like Quixtar
The drug test flow got you pissed off
So many say the game is contaminated, you niggas is animated
Meanin' you not real, fake nigga you Pixar
A short story, Toy Story 3, where the kids are
Now we have lift off, so I'mma just stay firin'
Phontigallo low, stay flyin'
Y'all wannabe niggas stay tryin'
But God is my God, don't be ashamed
Swallow your pride just like a gay lion, roar
Came back for a taste, Lil B, Phontigga back on the case
Feeling like G money in my space
They ain't come back for the cocaine
They came back for the BASE
