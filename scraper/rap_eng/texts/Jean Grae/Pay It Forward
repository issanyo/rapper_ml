[Verse 1:]
What, your love to me, I'm laid dead
Just waiting to see you, talking with you
Say you single
I don't need nothing else, there's a secret
(Full of you, more than love)
Now [?]
(Full of you, more than love)

[Verse 2:]
Your love to me, I'm laid dead
What, your love to me, I'm laid dead
Just waiting to see you, talking with you
Say you single
I don't need nothing else, there's a secret
(Full of you, more than love)
Now [?]
(Full of you, more than love)
