[Verse 1]
Back here at square one
Like I just did the home base run
Without winning any bases though
All basic reasoning out the window
Ron Browz shit, Erick Sermon style
Like I got kicked off a cloud
Method Man, ‘95
Rap references because you get em all
You even get that I should have said that it was ’94 (’93)
Hard place when you wanna still rock to it
Living in my glass house
Steady throwing rocks through it
I never stopped feeling the love for ya
I just stopped being the one for ya
I think
Too much
Over analyzing everything sucks
I’m over over-dramatizing everything but
You’re never on the level I’m on, unless we’re cut-ting
Plus then we never argued when thrusting but then
After all, it just turns to dust, brother
Swear I’d never love another if this really worked out
But this is just like watching fitness informercials from the couch
Ouch
I know, you’re lazy
It’s easier to pick a partner less crazy
Much less work, less purpose, less of A to Z
Cause I’m an alpha, bet it’s hard to stay with me
Heart palpitations do still occur though
You and me, some Merlot, situation blurs so
Much I be thinking how this shit could actually work again
It’s even nice to have you back in my world as my friend
Hey, sometimes I gotta say it simply (why)
Cause sometimes things are simple (come on)
We make it complicated for the win, B
Cause otherwise we’d just be faced with all the n-words
Inner child, inner space, inner monologue
We exchange intercourse without a dialogue
Introduce intimate ways to turn our fire off
The thing in us that seeks the spark, light
Higher, moth
I still adore you; you adore me theoretically
So now I gotta shut the door on you
So I can find out who is next for me

[Refrain]
You and me and everyone we know
That’s you and me and everyone we know

[Jean Grae: singing]
Cause you know, you’re not gonna find what you’re looking for
Stay searching
You and me and everyone we know
It’s you and me and everyone we know
It’s you and me
You and me and everyone we know
You, me, everyone we know
You and me and everyone we know
