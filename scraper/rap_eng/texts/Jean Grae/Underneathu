Place me in between your lips and I'll become a thousand roses
Lay me on your fingertips and I'll turn lace and clouds laid over
Make me wanna take days off work
You know we can
Make me wanna take off this skirt

You know that I'm so enamored with you baby
You could make a girl wanna stay home and just have some babies
We can slow it down if I'm moving too fast
I just wanna be
Underneath you
Underneath you
Underneath you
Underneath

Can you hear it
That's the sound of me falling for you
Don't you see me baby
That's the look of me crawling on my knees begging please to be
Under-

Yeah, yeah
Underneath you
Underneath you

Yeah...

Place me underneath your hips and I'll become a million oceans
Play with me between slow licks and I'll turn face then bow me over

Yeah, yeah yeah
Make wanna tell all my friends
You know I can't
(Why) (Why?? (Shit)
Not if them bitches ain't paying my rent
Can't know my man


We can slow it down if we're moving too fast
I just wanna be
Underneath you
Underneath you
