[Verse]
Yeah loser, well if you're choosing to go against Jean
You better assemble a squad that's better than the A-team
With the green hulk and shit that pop shirts
And a nigga with a shovel I can borrow when I drop the dirt
No lord, she's gone bizzurk again
The fucking pen was dripping blood and vision was fuzzy, blurred and then she murdered them
I flirt dirty visions mostly unheard from the mouths of women
I guess I've just been blessed with a criminal intuition
Spit with a girly voice and nerdy with prose
And fully dressed so no one accidentally trips and says, "Hold on a minute"
I flow so deep that I fall in it
Prolong words like penis and chokes that spin ?
I'm like trying to get free drugs, no credit
So fuck the industry, album had no edits
And fuck Prada, man, I'll ? cause I'm broke
And I'm sorry I gotta stay out of trouble, there's no HMO medic
Ah forget it, I'll just get off the syllable letter
Just fizzle like acid burning your flesh until it's down to the gristle
You listening now? Yeah, wow
Well piss in your mouth wit your own dick, come on niggas, fidget around
I'm about to get on everybody's last nerve
Take half of your crowd, pimp them out, have them calling your house
Nah, just fucking around
Small time like I'm a bunch of horny niggas, circle jerking with your digits, ow!
One for the ladies, two cops ? niggas on rooftops
Busting off shots with illegal 380's and drop
Three for me so I can easily triple it
Minus 8, double it, kick a mean 16
It's Jean, sorry if the intro was vague
The surname is Grae, purpose of the words I say
Just to get the chance to play
And hurt the birds who don't deserve to stay in it
So Black I'll smack you right in your cap
So that your knee can grow
Old nigga, figure it out
It's clever, so let's sing it together

[Hook]
You don't want it
You don't really really want it
You don't really...
