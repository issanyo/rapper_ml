[Verse 1: Quelle Chris]
If you two-wheel and tryna chill, get a kickstand
Everybody gettin' money had a game plan
Every truth seeker dropped by a hit man
Everybody alt-right gotta be white
Everybody disagree gotta be wrong
Everybody black dick gotta be long
Every mixtape dropped gotta be free
Everybody from the hood gotta be G
Everything in the news gotta be real, right?
Every Jew, golden rule, gotta save bills
Every young nigga gotta deadbeat daddy
Every independent lady attitude trashy
Anybody ain't lit gotta be old
If you dressed like that, you gotta wanna fuck
If I got locs, then they gotta stay blowed
And if it ain't fronto it gotta be a blunt
And if I cop squares, why they gotta be 'Ports?
Either keep it real or you Unc' Tom buggin'
If two ain't the same, why one gotta be broke?
You can play the game, I ain't gotta be nothin'
For you, but me
From the head nappy to feet
Can't hurry somethin' so complete
Took time like duck confit
If spaceships too far from your reach
It's weightless way down in the deep, yeah
You ain't 'bout to have me lose no sleep 'cause I'm grindin'
You ain't 'bout to see me snoozin', no sleep
Same time, man

[Verse 2: Jean Grae]
Young girl, side ponytail, thrift store garb
Frizzy hair, bookworm, but street smart
Immigrant children watchin' Buckwheat late night
Listen to Depeche Mode, Big Audio-o Dynamite
Identity crisis, coming later, vices
Are coming even later, prices for a life lived
Without life built, for the right price, guilt
'Cause you can be the things they say to be and get killed
With difficulty comes learnin'
Where typically those less exposed to those burdens
Can flourish without knowin' themselves
Without growin' themselves, without the moments of doubt
Moments of bells all ringin', singin', low self-esteem
Jean walk a hundred feet tall, walk mean
Talk obscene, craw guffaw, cross scenes
Never cross on the green, 'cause I ain't got to be nothing for you but me (but me)
From my 3B down to feet (to feet)
Can't fathom how it's so complete (complete)
Take ya time like duck confit (ahh shit)
Spaceships, they ain't never out of reach (outta reach)
I'm up high and down, down the deep (down deep)
You ain't bout to have me losin' no sleep, 'cause I'm grindin'
You ain't bout to see me snoozin', no sleep
Same time, man

[Chorus: Jean Grae & Quelle Chris]
For the 10 feet short
Hunnid degrees cold
Ridin' high on summit low
Mighty weak, light as stone
Pretty ugly, faded glow
Hold on tight, I'm letting go
One million dollars poor
Live to die, dyin' to grow

For the 10 feet short
Hundred degrees cold
Ridin' high on summit low
Mighty weak, light as stone
Pretty ugly, faded glow
Hold on tight, I'm letting go
One million dollars poor
Live to die, dyin' to grow

For the 10 feet short
Hundred degrees cold
Ridin' high on summit low
Mighty weak, light as stone
Pretty ugly, faded glow
Hold on tight, I'm letting go
One million dollars poor
Live to die, dyin' to grow

For the 10 feet short
Hundred degrees cold
Ridin' high on summit low
Mighty weak, light as stone
Pretty ugly, faded glow
Hold on tight, I'm letting go
One million dollars poor
Live to die, dyin' to grow

[Outro: Jean Grae & Quelle Chris]
Hold on tight, I'm letting go
Hold on tight, I'm letting go
Hold on tight, I'm letting go
Hold on tight, I'm letting go
