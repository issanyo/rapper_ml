[Verse 1]
Got subjects locked in my cerebral cortex
On Ampex tape, I'm circulating like a vortex
Check out my techs that use a synonym as inspect
Mentally badgering emcees with my dialect
When I inject memory, cell motors retrospect
To recollect—true, genuine skills I resurrect
Direct and live from the 2-1-2, 7-1-8, and 5-1-6 area.  Throughout
Borough to borough, state to state, world-thorough-wide
I ride, driving mass tracks to genocide
Verbal debater, the brain infiltrator
Break and fracture a sucka emcee's structural delegator
The pen and the pad and the microphone get blessed
Witness with these now how I digress
Brothers are getting busy grabbing TECs while I apex
Verbal backshots coming without the latex
Watch the caption spin as the wax begin
How I'm rapping in to hit the backspin
Now end first verse in the blend
Herbalise to Resource done done it again

[Chorus] (x2)
One of the three, the Natural R-e to the source
In the b-l-e-n-d
City to city (state to state), borough to borough
NYC to worldwide rock thorough

[Verse 2]
See, me and rhymes are like
Tooth to picks, sides to kicks
Chops to sticks, seas to sicks, hardness to bricks
Chest to Vicks, corruption to politics
Sticks to stones, stones to sticks—not opposites flips
Cheese to cakes, beefs to steaks
Bones to breaks, decks to tapes, good food to plates
Movies to dates, cities to states, odes to papes
Shaking MCs off they mics like earth to quakes
And now the hand of fate dealt me the higher intellect
Connect verbs, dissect words down to lecterns
W serves as the first repetition
H lines and curves take second position
A plays the third, the fourth brings the T
So hit two times so you will get umm…
One of the three, the Natural R-e to the source
In the b-l-e-n-d

[Chorus] (x2)
One of the three, the Natural R-e to the source
In the b-l-e-n-d
City to city (state to state), borough to borough
NYC to worldwide rock thorough

[Verse 3]
My verbal attacks react to mental stimulation
I'm leaving gaping contusions caused by lyrical abrasion
No pausing, no waiting
I play the plus and starting to get in
Shining like the sun
Lyrical patterns double up on the one
Like the name when expose the flame
I combust like aerosol or kerosene contained
Deaf ears turn the conversation severed
I set it off like Lateef and get it
Debted, forget it.  It only happens because you let it
I move, swift tongue sliced crews, beheaded
I said it again, so let the repetition end
Resource and Herbaliser in the blend

[Chorus] (x4)
One of the three, the Natural R-e to the source
In the b-l-e-n-d
City to city (state to state), borough to borough
NYC to worldwide rock thorough
