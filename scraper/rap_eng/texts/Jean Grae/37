I keep saying Imma find a love, but here I go
Feeling the worsening of feelings from a year ago
Can't fill in boxes on the internet, it's weird though
Can't put my pictures up cause they're a mirror for
Some creeping snitches who'd be like Jeannie is on sites
And then it turns into them clicking all the wrong types
Then turns to gossip possibly up in the Twitter streets
And then it's just the freaks, and me
It's really not appealing so I'd rather give it nothing no
Energy for the men and me expended in the clubbing
I was clubbing as an adolescent, my values less than my pals
My gals and me were never needed on the guest list
Maturityâ€™s a blessing
I want bourbon and investments, a permanent address
Even Murder Myrtle has changed
It ain't a certainty to personally wanna evolve, I seen a lot of stunted growth and
Folks who stumble in jobs, and I don't mean puncture folks balloons in front of their moms
But you be popping shit about them man what when they're gone
I can't take complaints about your babies you made life
I can't make a date to come around if you ain't right
Man I don't wanna watch Worldstar you ain't fight
You'd think you'd learn better things in your twenties, ha
You'd better burn your thoughts of learning get your nerves ready
And get your purse ready honey everything is money get fucking Nurse Betty
Nutty with personal problems
And get your first divorce maybe these are verses options
Even your opticals are changing, you prefer vodka
Drop Henny to drop calories, opt out of block parties or rap parties
And back out of brunches with a bunch of motherfuckers you don't even like
Doing it to prove to your what, you're losing in your life
And you discover things, that other things really more important
You're reading more again, you're seeking seasons more than often
Seeking offices, making travel, meeting offers, meeting deadlines, speaking more
And leaving awkward, but being cool with it later, I'll leave when I wanna
I'm cooler now than I would ever think about my number
