Make me wanna sa--

Sometimes, time don't let shit be done
Sometimes, your mind won't let shit go
Even if it's what you want, we know
Hearts don't give a good gatdamn, what you want

What do you need from me?
Feels like the right thing to ask while we're here at the top of the road
But, I don't know
I don't know
Rather say:

Nothing
Nothing
Nothing

Shit
I was doing fine spending time getting fucked up
Finding my peace....

Alone

Guess it's never gonna be a good time
Cause time don't give a good gatdamn what you want
What do you need from me?
Feels like a good time to ask since we're here at the top of the road
But I don't know
Man, I don't know
I'd rather say:

Nothing
Nothing
Nothing

Saying it won't is only making it worse
I need to control it
Nothing goes bad
Put it away

(and it goes down)

Saying it won't is only making it worse
I need to control it
Nothing goes bad
Put it away

And it goes down
And it goes down
And it goes down
