[Hook: Jean Grae]
(You...) Gotta get your damn hands up.  (Me...) Must keep on giving my all until
(All of us...) Got it locked for real and stay strong ‘til the truth’s revealed.  Keep on my niggas...
(You...) Gotta get your paper tight.  (Me...) Gotta get my paper right until
(All of us...) And invest, get it back, stay flippin’ it, they doin’ it.  Heads up, niggas, come on...
(You...) Stay maintaining this rock.  (Me...) Must speak truth every drop
(All of us...) Still stay running from the cops.  Y’all know ain’t nothing changed much...
(You...) Gotta know who you are and (Me...) must take this further, man, ‘til one day
(All of us...) We can all stand strong together and no man is severin’—not ever

[Verse 1: Jean Grae]
I see the responsibility. I'm cleverer than most others.  Don't smother these bars
I don't clutter it with garbage—won't mutter it ‘less it’s simply marvelous
And I need to know I’m a part of this.  Renaissance—shift over the marketin’
Won’t bother me hardly.  My mind since back to starvin’, part partial to startin’
Huge riots caused by new pre-OTTs
Move out the way, biatch, or end up in triage
We got more this year.  Severe rain.  Increase the flame
Little bit higher so fire slips out the frame
Until I retire—that’s never.  Y’all can remain ambivalent
‘Cause from this point, nothing changed the sentiments
Quitting is now hard to say just like cinnamon
I fear...

[Hook: Jean Grae]
(You...) Gotta know when it’s time to stand up.  (Me...) Must keep everybody crunk
(All of us...) Must speak when want.  Don't sleep—it’s important.  Trust, I wouldn’t lie to ya
(You...) Must get your hands in the sky.  (Me...) We’ll keep this party live until
(All of us...) Fall out.  Now it’s time for some of y’all to get called out

[Verse 2: Jean Grae]
I gotta build every record, keep reachin’
Lover of free speech, fucker with these beats, a
Bubbling name, struggle, fame made stronger by
Ducking our aim, sucking pain.  I'll bomb your chain
Right off your torso and also
Disconnect your neck from your poor throat for
Tryin’ to take my glory and my shine
You get floored ‘til your pourin’ it south
Beyond permanent pause in the coroner’s house (And)
Time is the case and I'm on with fine pace
And a line so proper from my momma: “I’m laced”
And my pockets got poppa but I'm on the paper chase
I don't fuck around.  You better shut your mouth
‘Til me spill rounds, all of us running now
I've got a cunning mouth.  Y’all got a cunt in yours.  I'm out
Catch you on tour...

[Hook: Jean Grae]
(You...) Gotta get your damn hands up.  (Me...) Must keep on giving my all until

(You...) Gotta get your paper tight.  (Me...) Gotta get my paper right until
(All of us...) And invest, get it back, stay flippin’ it, they doin’ it.  Heads up, niggas, come on...
(You...) Stay maintaining this rock.  (Me...) Must speak truth every drop
(All of us...) Still stay running from the cops.  Y’all know ain’t nothing changed much...
(You...) Hey thanks for feelin’ this song.  (Me...) I’m out... (Let’s keep goin’...)
(All of us...)
