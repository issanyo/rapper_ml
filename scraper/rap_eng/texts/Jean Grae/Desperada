[Intro]
Wait...wait...wait...I'm not ready yet...

[Verse One]
Then I lay me down on this cold floor
Oh Lord I hope for the cloaked, no intervention saw
That's where I paused, Jeanie, many more fleeting moments
Heck, you just cheating yourself from meeting
I can breathe a ton of these demons into my lungs
And I beat 'em no matter what self defeating attack comes
I put the past in the closet, leave it behind
Locked under key I would cast aside until I needed it padlocked
Put in a stash box, move it along
I learned how to learn patience and when acting is wrong
Turn 360 leisurely, pessimism know her and he grieve with me
Bleed with me, then I got sober, it agrees with me
I moderated shots slower
Finding the piece of me, thank God it was over
I'm here

[Hook] {x2}
I couldn't imagine why I was granted a second chance at life
But I'm so glad that I saw the light
And I see now my purpose right
My purpose right

[Verse Two]
Just think, what have I accomplished?
End of my life bonkers
What other pill to conquer
It would've just been awkward
Roommates explaining and didn't know why I changed
Since little before I named some pitiful reason lame or
Breaking down doors had even burst in tears
Grieving nurses to fear
Even land lady just standing and looking all fucked up
Like look what the fuck kids
Then cuff someone's arrested for punching a chest in
Wait
Just glad it never had to happen that way
I never would have had an album
Never had met Collin
Never had been travelling
Never had new problems
Never learned how to solve 'em
Never knew I'd evolve then

[Hook]

[Bridge] {x2}
And now I lay me down to sleep
I pray the Lord my soul to keep
If I should die before I wake
Wait
