One, two, three
Breathe easy
One, two, three
Breathe easy
One, two, three
Breathe easy
Out of breath and you haven't even heard me spit

Welcome to the Rap Olympics
Jean Grae the gold medalist
Dirty like old gymnastic coaches prone to pedophilia
Rap stamina longer than European professional pedalists
I bench press verbs, phrases and predicates
Make you run the track backwards
Like dyslexic hundred-yard dashes
Or treadmills that work in reverse
I'm the total package
Flow six pack
Syllables flip back
Dominique Dawes
Flawless triple somersaults in the mat
10.0 man head to toe
Line for line I'll rip you in the Strong Man comp limb from limb
Stick you with sharp-witted spit that's targeted like javelin throws
Pass these chicks like water and I'm the breaststroke
Collapse your chest and throat with final distances
This is a warning for anyone thinking of verbal brawling
I will kill you
Maybe just hit you with the lead pipe
Come on, y'all Brian Boitano
I'm all Tanya Harding, bitch please
I crunch comp like tummies and ab flexes
Smash egos to bits at once with the size of Texas
Push down chicks with push-ups and tits in their neck
To distract you from the fact that even their ghostwriters are wack
Smack you with your own hand, make you apologize
Rhymes are more brolic than teams of Yugoslavic women
Now that's gully, you just silly
Like Monopoly money paid by the Russians to rob the French judges
Kill me like Jason Williams claimed the chauffeur did
Go for the toast
I choke you with smoke and fire spit
Boast cause I'm nicer with the mouthpiece than the whole Team Liberty
You're confused like Skifest barbecues
Ice grilling me
Shit I'm straight sick, you straight bitch
Only way you'll come first with your dick in your fists
Can't even get bronze, you could maybe get fifth
If you couple your score of nothing
With the number of digits I'mma scar your face with
High-jump your gas dome
My words pole vault while yours stay at low levels with asphalt, asshole
I'm your new personal trainer, it's Jean
Get niggas' heads bouncing harder than Greg Louganis, obscene
About to change your whole perspective of rap
How many times you think you're gonna play this shit back
