[Verse 1: Jean Grae]
Most of this here is just braggadocio
Emphatically spoke, impeccable rap flow
Second to that, wordplay akin to watching a verb
Hitting a piñata on the eve of its birthday
Uncommon like Erykah Phenomenon! Hysteria!
Hype, rocks millennium Sade criteria
Fuck the hearsay, please Jean's superior
Y'all yellow the same color of your bladder's interiors
You bore me to pieces, you feces mouth
And, yes, it's still shit if I mispronounce it bitch
How could it be doubted The beast mounted the pen
We're unsurmountable like you being surrounded by a ten man army in Afghanistan tents
With a caravan of Carolina and New York feds
Bless me with a holy 40 bottle from your corner stop and
Bet all your model entourage that we can get you popping
I'll deliver your liver on a plate with a slither of your shivering date
There's no mercy here put on your worsest gear
Your fucking with the word career
Assassin who just gave the job to murk ye onto Daily Planet
I raise havoc, like giving Mobb Deep a booster chair
Stupid, I'm uncouth and in the booth I'm rare
Name Northern Lights Pimp game, Dolemite
Spleens on assorted recordings I'm giving all the mics
Slaughtering them like cattle, hoarding the words
And then cornering them leaving just the ring it's absurd
I murder just for the fun of the sound of bodies falling
I'm eccentric I don't need white coats calling
It's just dementia, come on, quit your bawling
You'll only make Jean just slit your paws in
And then there's bloody parts and Jean's starts to saw and
It'll be ridiculous You're strawberry licorice
All over my kicks Mom mourning Snap! Picture this

[Verse 2: Daily Planet]
For the record Imma keep spitting
Game booking
And leave the game looking
Like a shepherd with its sheep missing
I know you seen Dai'
On a lean
Spray your team Tres schemes[?]
In Inglés wtih Jean Grae
Raising Cane phrasing slang cause shit is foul
In this flagrant game I'm O-fficial
Lingual assaults mangle
Wings on the archangel
The Grim Reaper's cane got my face and name
So I readily phrase spoke[?]
And repping respray hope and
I'm steadily paid til heavenly gates open
Rhyme's musical, I'm fluent through
Spitting lyrics your spirit is congruent to
Nigga, I been rapping I handle that
'long as I got a ten track and a camel pack
I paid my dues
Never half step
Used to stomp niggas down just to raise my shoes
Obey my rules or face consequence from lower lower 3rd, the 8th continent
Come one come all the track is strong
I'm talking Clark with no glasses on cats is wrong
Waiting on a rebel when there's factions armed
Y'all niggas playing on a level that I practice on
I'm willing to off these my aura's still in recital
Of killing them softly like Lauryn Hill with a silencer
So drilling your softies [?????????????????????]
Revealing your flaw, chilling, while peeling your top Please!
