[Chorus]
Tell me what ya

[Verse 1]
Deny me, [?]
Outsider boundaries, walls that can't hold me
Eight-hundred-and-eight ways to straight flourish
If I [?]
And I'll be ready when the fires roll, tumble through the concrete jungle that'll rumble under my feet
And will you watch in style [?] as we countdown or will you hightail at high speeds, guard down
'Cause everyone's thinking the game boss now
But everyone's game has chink in the armor, we lost now, crosstown
We making choices based on paper and a [?]
'Cause I could think [?] neighbor like they had that
Fast forward, unified thoughts till we're limitless
Levitate on images, infinite, pill it on every atom that enters in
Turn it, turn that energy to medicine
Parable past, but leave the [?] in
What if heaven is as erratic as this plane you wastin
Your time on, you're chasing, your whole grind based in
Gold miners, goal miners [?]
Find us in alliance in line with the finest
They divide us and we bountiful
Your way and my way need to line up more
Eye-to-eye, or be the highway isn't fine at all
We the light of all, fuck we even fightin' for?
Say it again, baby, divide us and we bound to fall
Your way and my way need to line up more
Eye-to-eye, or be the highway isn't fine at all
We the light of all, fuck we even fightin' for?

[Chorus]
Tell me what ya
Tell me what ya
Tell me what you came for
Came for

Tell me what you came for
Came for

Came for
Tell me what you came for
Came for

Came for
Tell me what you came for

[Outro]
Tell me what you came for
Came for

Came for
Came for
Came for
