[Verse 1]
All right, let's get down to business
Pour out some Guinness
Khrysis, get on the jack and tell them they're so finished
Christ to the Jesus, the Jeanius came back as a Phoenix
9th like, "Yo Jean, I got some heaters"
Well, I got some lines that turn grown men
Back into the fetus position with they penis pissing
Didn't mean to be the meanest spitting
It just happened, you know?
Like getting drunk and then you slip and you're cheating (oh!)
It's been a crazy year -- brought back the doorknockers
Baby hair, one sleeve up like Slim Shady's gear
I'm writing with Afeni's baby work ethic
Plus I'm Aileen Wuornos... minus the murder record
Plus I'm highly unconcerned -- you can find me, mouth turned
Like the smiley up on AOL (you're a fucking nerd!)
Fuck it -- so? You fucks with it, though
The structureless flow
The seemingly haphazard, really exact patterns
So Jean is Jean Travers, y'all is just jackasses
By and large, the fact of the matter that I'm in charge, that rapper
That's accurate, spectacular, fantastic
Scrumtrulescent, uncontested funky, bitch

[Hook]
You all steppin' cause this is the fucking jam
People turning the beat up, my people clap their hands
My niggas keep truckin', my ladies throw up your hands
Dance to the record, just dance to the record girl

You all steppin' cause this is the fucking jam
People turning the beat up, my people clap their hands
My niggas keep truckin', my ladies throw up your hands
Dance to the record boy, dance to the record boy

[Verse 2]
I need a private insane asylum to grant asylum to me
It could get violent quickly if you don't believe me, God forgive me
An honorary anonymous superstar
Followed by the very time I salute where the stupid fall
A low road, but no going back
Not when you've got a fucking logo in the promo rack
Signing records, taking pictures -- you can no-no that
Gotta finish, gotta win; as God as my witness, I'm in...
And y'all'll have to jump me out of this bitch
I'm talking Eastsiders, Westsiders, Blood-ers, and Crips
All them Decepts, at least three sets and grips
And I'll reset -- until then, it's recess, bitch
So c'mon

[Hook]
