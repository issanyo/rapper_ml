[Verse:]
[?] I get laid now
Wanted it to be my way
But time won't take it
Baby erase all the rules, yes
Never did well until
Maybe just a fool
You , you, range [?]
What you mean to me
You, you range
Won't you be with me now
I won't take offense
Baby where we go wrong, ask me bout love
Always is giving hard
Maybe he's the, star of
