[Verse One – Jean Grae and (Lord Sear)]
To hell with gold and riches, niggas and bitches
Don't even want 'em—all I need is you (I love you too)
See, we was meant to be.  Eventually, we man and wife
Livin’ in sin for years, chillin’ like shots of gin and beers
You the one who gets me high when I need it
We fight when we're together.  Cry sometimes, but never sever ties
Where would I be without you in the club with me?
At home, stuck up in the zone, straight pissy
We shifty.  Together, we're complete—there's no other one for me
I smoke sometimes but really prefer your company (You don't really mean that)
Yes I do.  Baby, listen.  Who keeps you in the cup and never on the floor?
Who's checking for you soon as I'm walking up in the door?
Who never stopped asking you, "Baby, give me some more?"
Please, I love the way you pour out whether store bought or free
It's just you and me (Say my name, say my name!)
Brown and beautiful, smooth, intoxicating
It's illegal but still holding you in the street
We play until the bar close
I take you home.  You taste sweet
Except for that part where I throw you up all over my clothes

[Hook – Jean Grae and (Lord Sear)]
Yo, I got this problem (what?).  Can you help me?
(Why?  She's in love with the bottle of the Hennessy)
The shit just ain't right, I gotta make it stop
(Ayo, she in love with the bottle of the Henn Rock
Ayo, you can't be with me.  Bitch, you must be tipsy)
But I'm love with the bottle of the Hennessy
(Yo girl, this shit ain't right.  Yo, you gotta make it stop)
But I'm love with the bottle of the Henn Rock

[Verse Two – Lord Sear]
Hey, what's up?  How ya feel?  You're cold, looking hot
It's your main shit stain, the big Henny Rock
Why don't you cop a squat and sit right next to me
So we can talk about the birds and the bees
Let me grab on those tits and you can grab on these
Sexually and mentally, I love yo steez
When you drink a fifth of me right in the club
You didn't need no motherfucking cup
That's what I like about you—you don't give a fuck
Yo, I gotta get with you, girl—that's a must
Even though the night is about to end
You know you walking out with your main man Henn
The realest of the real, the coolest of the cool
When you drink a shot of me, it goes down smooth
So hey baby girl, I know you ain't no fool
It's almost that time, so what we gon' do?

[Verse 3 – Jean Grae]
I know this after fo' spot that's banging
Maybe we'll do a little drunk karaoke singing
You got me stumbling, spitting, and cursing
All up in my 40 nursing
Swerving into people, pissin’ on the church when
We spendin’ the night.  I'm never light weight
We, like, date-every evening.  Fiending for you like a junkie demon
So let's collaborate and go to bars and break rules
Smash bats and cars and shit.  You the only one I wanna be with

[Hook – Jean Grae and (Lord Sear)]
Yo, I got this problem (what?).  Can you help me?
(Why?  She's in love with the bottle of the Hennessy)
The shit just ain't right, I gotta make it stop
(Ayo, she in love with the bottle of the Henn Rock
Ayo, you can't be with me.  Bitch, you must be tipsy)
But I'm love with the bottle of the Hennessy
(Yo girl, this shit ain't right.  Yo, you gotta make it stop)
But I'm love with the bottle of the Henn Rock

[Verse Three – Jean Grae and Lord Sear]
[Lord Sear]
Hey baby, that's cool.  I wanna be with you, boo
Henny Rock anytime, any day after school
Beginning of the church, even the early morn'
Henny gon' be with you till the day is dawn
[Jean Grae]
You made me hurl.  You made me snuff my girl
You made me even curse my moms, but you still my world
I love the way you smell, the way you give 'em hell
And if I cheat on you, know that I got to tell
[Lord Sear]
Ayo, you bugging out right now ‘cause you ain't telling nobody
This a fifth of liquor you talking to—this ain't Bacardi
This motherfuckin' Henny Rock.  Cool out and chill
Can I see you next week around five until?
[Jean Grae]
If I could marry you and go up on a honeymoon
Put you in a glass, dance to our favorite tune
But it could never happen with us—I know we can't do it (why?)
Well for one, I'm human and you're fluid

[Hook – Jean Grae and (Lord Sear)]
Yo, I got this problem (what?).  Can you help me?
(Why?  She's in love with the bottle of the Hennessy)
The shit just ain't right, I gotta make it stop
(Ayo, she in love with the bottle of the Henn Rock
Ayo, you can't be with me.  Bitch, you must be tipsy)
But I'm love with the bottle of the Hennessy
(Yo girl, this shit ain't right.  Yo, you gotta make it stop)
But I'm love with the bottle of the Henn Rock
