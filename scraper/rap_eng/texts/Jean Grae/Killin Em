[Verse 1: Jean Grae]
Jean, always inappropriate
The socially inept, the stogie smoker
With a Boba Fett helmet on the red carpet
That I bought from Target
See you can do it too, I just take it the farthest
Screw you
I can make you take your brain apart
With garden tools a rake to start with, ho
Get out my lane for starters, I'm a rapist barber
I'll line 'em up and fuck their faces with this
Razor sharp wit, as sharp as 8 guitar picks
Fitted with lasers on 'em
I'm getting Asian on 'em
Do the math
Stations got Nathan on 'em, nothing
Playing, fucking cowards
You're due the wrath, I do devour, rude for hours
Due to last, brutal bruiser, Shropshire Slasher
Fucking posers, I'm unglued and past help I'm know I'm
Self help books ....with no pages on stages, felt this?
Cooked by Food Chain, it's amazing, hey, keep her
In your good graces cause I'm...I'm uh...

[Hook]
Killing everybody in sight

[Verse 2: Jean Grae]
Finagle verbatim with anger
Based in hatred, for lazy rappers
Play me backwards, get no satan statements
The opposite of Jason Statham, never crunk mechanic, nope
I'm drunk, my manics, slow, I never judge or panic
Panoramic flow, as wrong as NAMBLA on
Yo Gabba Gabba's show, when I'm in town the ambulances show
Word evangelist, diabolical vandalist
Infamous, Maya Angelou with Marlon Brando shit
Cantankerous as kangaroos on angel dust
I'll kick your face in til your face is facing 8 of us
I'm out of order, got restraining orders? Wait, your honor!
He made me do it, I'm a angel, check my face, I'm honest
I make electric chair music
I dare you music
It's fair to use it in scenarios wherever you is
View it as killer, not sedated or some euthanasia
When Jean is illing
Call your mama tell her that your days up
I'm...I'm ... uh

[Verse 3: Pharoahe Monch]
Myers, Michael, Psycho
Lucky Number Slevin
6 million ways to die
Saw Seven
Leaving skeletons charred with dental records revealed...
Post...
Stab Kelloggs strangle General Mills
Gattaca, black magic more dramatic than Attica
Defrost your head and then smack the
Shit out of yah, then refreeze it call it the
First murder remix, kill 'em revive em I leave them alive paraplegic
I've never seen my reflection, guess who you're about to interview
Make heads spin, literally, separate blood...
Centrifuge
Generally accused of a mutant who
Kills sentinels eventually
For days of futures past intentionally
I'm in a clinic for sinners who reach there insanity pinnacle
Strangle instrumental interludes with chords umbilical
Step light, expedite
Left, right, ventricle from Queens to Flint
No finger print is identical I'm
