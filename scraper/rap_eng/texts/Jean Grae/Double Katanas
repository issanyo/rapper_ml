[Intro]
I can see what you’re saying
Definitely see that
What I’m saying is
Just give me a hug
We don’t have to think about it like that
I know, I know, it hurts
Here, give me hug

[Verse 1]
I really could have been more
Perceptive to what you came for
I guess the lesson is before you change doors
Change locks, change floors
Tried to keep you in the same field, same force
That he was in when we was in a major game loss
Can’t play the game with two pitchers, one mound
Either head is swingin' with my head down
In the beginning, I was thinkin' what’s the damage though
Advantage you, love no
Not considerin' your time spent
Not considerin' your lies that were mine over time spanned
Or how I feel if maybe if in my feelings
I would start to get the feeling of being the one played
Considering maybe you were saying things too
That came as easily as things do

[Hook]
I know, I know, I know, I know
And maybe I could work someone else out
I know, I know, I know, I know
And we could make this work
I know, I know, I know, I know
Nah, hilarious, ha ha

[Verse 2]
I guess the joke is on Jean
Playing the fucking field with no team
Guess I had a lot of nerve to keep ‘em closely
And never nervous, thinking shit was keeping toasty
You’re doing too much, wish my niggas told me
And in the clutch I wish my crutch had been to notice it
That I was all up in the crushes like I’m Jodeci
Feenin’, or JoJo on the floor, heaving
We were on the road to being major, Deegan
We were on our board baby, swore the train was leaving
But not the train, like a train, heathen
Fuck it, I’m just tired of tryna explain even
Luck would have it, I don’t have a habit of believing
Motherfuckers who sucker you to stab it and then leave it
I'm a fucking elitist, rapping, undefeated
Trying to play a game I never motherfucking needed

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Now Jeanie gotta go, I was saying that
In retrospect no disrespect
What everybody says, before they play your deck
I mean read your cards
You know? Hip your bars, bars, bars
I never meant to get fly, slide on the get-by
It’s not my style, next time I exit like a jet pilot
Eject up, I mean the high way
Not the highway, I mean the more desired way
Shut up, okay
I probably shouldn’t explain nothin'
Not in the double-negative way, I mean nothin'
Really all just said what I could say, fuck it
I’ve overextended my stay, bucket
List, I cross off the crosswind
That’s what I call this inevitable crossing
It’s a terrible loss and I’m more terrible for it
Fuck it, I’m just kidding, this whole thing was awesome

[Outro]
Ah, shit, I probably shouldn’t laugh
That’s right, that’s wrong, right
No, it’s not funny, it’s not funny
I’m not laughing
I’m—no, I’m—this is me caring about your feelings
Please, help me to help you
If you just—you should probably take your pants off
Cause I want to give you a hug
I wanna give you a hug
A close hug, a really close hug, a naked hug
Now, are you mad?
Are you leaving?
Oh um, will you call me tomorrow?
No? Okay. Okay, don’t answer that
Okay, I wasn’t thinking about—okay
It’s cool, it’s cool
I understand, I understand
No, I lied so, that’s probably bad for you
And also me, and me
Yes, don’t do that and I get that now
And I want to make it up to you
Can I just talk to you in the other room?
I talk a lot better when I’m laying down
No? You know?
Alright, well, fuck it
