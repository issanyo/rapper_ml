[Intro]
Hark! Who goes yonder?
It is I! Prince Paul of Nottingham
Well, Speak up man what is it?

Alright listen, Imma tell you my story

[Verse 1: ???]
Rhyme [Valour?] 500 pound gorilla, King Kong
When I sing songs, heads play ping-pong
I fill her, body up with plenty of ding dong
She loves me hugs me, because we rich
I ain't fuckin' witcha man cause your man's a snitch
He ran and bitched, I run the streets
Come with heat when you flossin'
Niggas be pricin', whatchu costin'?
We beat niggas up often, I ain't braggin'
Violent times, violent rhymes
Smart niggas come with silent nines
You couldn't miss, oh my goodness
How, could this
One man break the back of a whole rap pack
Then hit the streets strapped, armed for combat
Niggas get back slapped, I bet that hurt
Bitches get the blackjack right up under that skirt
They call him [Valour?], all aces
The first time out, I got four Questlove faces

[Hook: ???]
Fuck it, that's how I'm feelin' today
Fuck it, you best to be on your way
Fuck it, I ain't in the mood to play
Motherfucker, somebody gots to pay

[Verse 2: ??? & Jean Grae]
Coming through with the crew, I gots to [heat?] clock figures
And if I must feed my seeds, I'll bust both triggers
Twentyfo' [?], only sixteen shots
Still wouldn't have a clue, now who [?]
I return to the scene, of the crime you know the sayin'
Like the [holocaust?] I paid the cost, on my knees prayin'
Live, I let live I die, let die
Why ask why, whats the reason
Who the fuck am I?

Jean, who the fuck else control the mic like this?
The album twenty dollars, cost of my vocals? priceless
Hit your ribcage and flip and split your [dates?] wig
When I spit from the corner of [?] stage
Switch it like hips on [fish?], I'm sick nigga
Flick y'all off like ashes on cigarettes
Slicker than water that's filled with axeon
[rip ya neck?] on, any fuckin' track I rep on

[Hook: ???]
Fuck it, that's how I'm feelin' today
Fuck it, you best to be on your way
Fuck it, I ain't in the mood to play
Moth-

"There's no one that can match me. My style isï»¿ impetuous, my defense is impregnable, and I'm just ferocious. I want your heart. I want to eat his children. Praise be to Allah."

[Outro: ???]
Yo, yo check it out. This one goes out to my long island crew. My man Bumpy Knuckles, R.A the Rugged Man, Horror City, De La Soul and DJ P.Paul [?]. Yeu-ah!

(It happened years ago, life closed in on her too much. She was mentally ill. Then slowly the lights came on again, she recovered. All that is behind her, or is it?)
