So tired lord of thinking what we gonna be
So tired I'm thinking what I want done to me
I'm so through of not taking this to the wall
Baby ain't you?
Maybe we could have it all
Maybe I could get you a drink
I wanna throw you against the wall nigga
With unmitigated gall nigga
Rub on the Jeannie, get your wish baby
Rub on my chest like Vicks, baby
I don't need text baby, come on and cash my checks baby
I mean sex most definitely
I need to bone like we x-rated
Don't be afraid to take me down now advance go round the corner come downtown
Don't be afraid of all the ink boy
What's my name? Make me really have to think, boy
Knock me outta my shoes, spill my drink baby get in the groove
