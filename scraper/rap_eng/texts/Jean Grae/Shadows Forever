[Verse One]
There's no back up nigga
This is the last plan
Stuck in a tunnel like a CAT scan
And planted in city barren desert
It's a flat lands
African misplaced
Catch me up on stages, one fist raised
The gas can on my waist
The match poised to strike
A tongue forked with the poisonous bite
The poison ivy with the cordless mic, see
Jean's the dawn before the atomic lightening
The spawn of everyone who never liked me
I'm bi-polar
Born to fight me in the morning
I'm losing
But when the darkness moves in who's to win
I'm more than likely
Abuse highly
I bruise lightly and move swiftly
If choosing sides I'd advise you to fucking move with me
Your steps shitty, you doo-doo
I step pretty
My two shoes equipped with two razors that eject quickly
This isn't riddle rap
It's just a little harder
So put your thinkinb caps on
Nigga, I rip smarter
S. Dot Carter song, cover a rap lover
I'll jack a fucking beat from your mother
I trust none of ya
I'll pull the ground from under the front of your Hummer
Let it roll back til the phones crack some of your bones black
I hold back nothing
I'm told that, you chose fronting
There's no bluffing
I'm so bold
I rock gold nuggets with no budget
That's tucked in another chain
Shit, 1999 and some change
I don't give a fuck

[Hook] [x2]
Oh Lord
Why did you send
The darkness to me

[Verse Two]
Brace yourself like a plane crash stance
The words break dance all over your face and hands
And I'll be damned if you motherfuckers think you're advance
Makes you better than me
Better change those plans
This is your introduction to new thinking
A new inning
I'm through sinking
I swim through it
I've been doing it
Since '95 pursuing it
9 to 5 with a 24/7 nigga
Think of booing it
Jean ruin rap dreams like a teen losing and screwin' in the backseat
Quittin' school, pregnant from doing it, I'm
So calm and collected, but so drama conflicted
This life's trauma made a horrible sickness
So I spit somber and liquid grammar
Lip with the humor and mixed with the tan
The wicked stamina to consumers
A storyteller with a story
Everything I've been through with
You can't ignore me any longer
Never confuse it with
Anything other than rap music
That new shit
Clap your hands to it or clap your man to it
Or get mad, you can't do it
I'm damn foolish you're damn clueless
Who put you onto Jean, your man knew it, aww

[Hook] [x2]
Oh Lord
Why did you send, the darkness to me
