[Intro]
At night some of these ladies and gentlemen try to get together and try and show each other whatever little they know of these instruments. Sometimes Friday and Saturday nights, they take the dancehalls and they play this music. And they burn those places up till daybreak

[Hook: Jean Grae] {x2}
Bronx, Queens, Brooklyn, Staten Island, Manhattan we wildin'
Summer in the city, drop down, block hotter the top town

[Verse One: Jean Grae]
Hazy shade of summer in Metropolis
Barometer broke, the cops followed us
Smoke the drop top owners [?] Brooklyn
Burning 'em, looks turn to sirens, sirens flip to pyro-
-Tecnics flying, murked soldiers
Holland Tunnel the roof caved in, no survivors
Harlem riots, stores Molotov, the radio pirate
80 year old shooting off heat seekers
Fitted with bullets that'll enter your gullet leave sneakers
Lick a shot, singing prayers, make a drop, lay a splash
Tribeca waves crash start to change, New York City rot
Hot like the Hell rising
[?] lead flying, summertime

[Hook]

[Scratching]
"Run shit man"

[Verse Two: Jean Grae]
Kids on the project benches with arms shanked off
Everybody robs some banks and drives tanks off
Grand Thefts automatic, gun laws, traffic and drugs get passed
Curfew failed, they'll murk you in jail
Subway rail stop, we living underground in the dark
Save the lights when the third rail sparks
Central Park is for triage, beeotch
Pimps and dealers [?]
Queens, hoes and mobsters
The helicopters beam for the killer copper team
Will come in and pop your teens in your home and take your thangs
Armageddon Rocko, you ready? We headed for summer
And it's slowly getting hotter, every borough take cover nigga

[Hook]

[Verse Three: Jean Grae]
The smokers banning led to the night curfew
The plants in the nightstand, phone in the light circuits
Control and the whole plan backfired
And Gracy Mansion exploded
Ten tokens found deep throated
Government couldn't touch us
Too many started looting
Shooting at Con Edison buildings, burning our billings
Parents abandon children in the middle of the city
Until the [?] a ton of infants
Give me food, give me water, give me chaos, rain
We stay off lanes and spray out brains
Broke the chains of structure
Bodied the whole government...
And we lovin' it
And we lovin' it
And we lovin' it

[Hook]
