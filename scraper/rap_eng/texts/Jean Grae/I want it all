[Verse 1]
Tell me who you want me to be
I want to capture it all
Tell me what you want me to see
I will just see through it all
Cause I've been there
And I don't drive around that easy
Cause [?]
I want it all

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
I'll tell you how I want it to be
I don't care for your thoughts at all
I'll tell you how [?]
Don't tell me I'm wrong
Cause I've been there
And I don't drive around that easy
I want you back
This time
I want it all

I've been there
And I don't drive once easy
I want you back
