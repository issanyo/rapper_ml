[Verse 1: Quelle Chris]
Yo, one city defines the state of a cold country
8:50, the night devours the day hungry
Providing light for freaks who precede from the rosters of
1/5th of club hoppers rocking their favorite outfits
1/5th of dopeheads tipping a fifth of vodka
1/5th of big fella thug niggas lifting the block up
The other two vary in hoods through various projects
And middle class areas carrying angels and monsters
This is life
Hip-hop's most dangerous topic
Embedded in prophets who preach in the presence of moshpits
But even in it’s most hectic the city is precious
The powerful pressure felt when learning a hard lesson
Confessions of first times in your lifeline
Came with the sunshine after nights far from your right mind and
Sometimes it's beautiful
Sometimes it's not
Sometimes it's knucklehead niggas
Lotta times it's the cops
Some brothers live in the dark all day rotting between a rock and a hard place
'Cause the light of day is a way to chase ya liquor up
And it takes a hard shake to wake a nigga up
Working the graveyard shift to get ya figures up
Hitting the strip club
Dollars weighing them strippers down
Er'body waitin' for the moon to come around
Like everybody waiting for the moon to come around
Like everybody waiting for the moon to come around
Like everybody waiting for the moon to come around
Like everybody waiting for the moon to come around
Like everybody waiting for the moon to come around
Er'body waitin' for the moon to come around

[Chorus: Anna Wise]
Don't waste your dreams
It's never gonna be perfect (perfect)
Know how it seems doing now
It's always worth it
Sometimes it feels like (it feels like)
You can't hold on
But hold on, don't let today bring you down
Baby don’t you wait for the moon to come around

[Verse 2: Jean Grae]
Fernanda's mama said work hard
Live hard because your time is short
Exactly why I kicked my life into high-gear when my mama died
Less traumatized than apologetic
For all the times I waited on some kinda rise up. revolution from the people forget
To make me equal, to level the playing field at least to
Let me play the game
But these two could never play the same
I should have known it from her own shit how
Polarizing bullshit get, gender get, race get
Perception get
Stay in your place get
Know you role, no regrets
Connection of your faith in yourself
And owning it
Wish she could've lived out all her wishes fully without all her ties to us
I say that with the understanding that I never could've lived out all my wishes even partly without all her ties to us
But I'm alive, so thus
I never wait for tomorrow cause it's the future and this linear times a vacant suture
Praise Tesla
Never wait for shit to happen is the primal lesson
So you best to get down now, come on

[Chorus: Anna Wise]
Don't waste your dreams
It's never gonna be perfect (perfect)
Know how it seems
Doing it now is always worth it
Sometimes it feels like (it feels like)
You can't hold on
But hold on, don't let today bring you down
Baby don’t you wait for the moon to come around

[Verse 3: Mosel]
Moon, scratch that Muna
In Arabic, that be desire
A frequent flyer
Fixing up my discipline the days reveal my Destiny
Niggas can't eff with me, like Nasir's daughter
Better get your money up, the Rap Gods taunt us
Mistakes from the previous generation still haunt us
The age of awakenings upon us, but they don't really want us
To tap into Ubuntu regardless
Folks waiting for the moon
I'm waiting for my son to come around
'Cause my BM on her BS, what a fucking clown
What I'm gon' do now?
Be stressed, psych we blessed to travel peaks and valleys
Allah Subhanwatallah is keeping the tallies of life's test
So reverence your testimony with glory
Al Rahman ir-Rahim authored the story
Abdul Jabbar used to spit bars in cars with Corey
Mosel been that nigga since I was dating Midori
Rewind Selectah! But time flies
I done seen thousands of moons in my lifetime
I done seen it from both sides of the globe, clothed under luminous night skies
They'll be plenty more moons Insha’Allah
Everybody waiting for they moon to come around
I'm just praying that my son can hear me now

[Bridge: Mosel]
H- h- hear me now
Hear me now

[Chorus: Anna Wise]
Don't waste your dreams
It's never gonna be perfect (perfect)
Know how it seems doing now
It's always worth it
Sometimes it feels like (it feels like)
You can't hold on
But hold on, don't let today bring you down
Baby don’t you wait for the moon to come around
