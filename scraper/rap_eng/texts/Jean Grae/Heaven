[Verse 1: Iman Omari]
When was it last
That you took the time to free yourself
Tend to your mind
There is no need to bother with time
Worries at ease
All thoughts are divine
Just look within
I wish you could see
All that your are
All you could be
I'll give you love
Love is my goal
Got to be real
Reapin' what is sown
Reapin' what is sown

[Hook: JaVonte' & Iman Omari]
Heaven might be beneath you
Oooooh (Heaven heaven heaven)
Heaven might be beneath you
Oooooh (Heaven heaven heaven)
If you just let go (let go let go)
You can touch heaven (you can touch heaven)
If you just let go (let go let go)
You can touch heaven (you can touch heaven)
(Heaven heaven heaven)

[Verse 2: Iman Omari]
Our future's here
Love has no limit
Be open now
We're always in it
Placed in your hand
And within your heart
Is all the hope
To take us far
Most precious gift
I know you deserve it
All that i've got
Know what your worth is
I'll give you love
Love is my goal
I see you still
I have always known
I have always known

[Hook: JaVonte' & Iman Omari]
Heaven might be beneath you
Oooooh (Heaven heaven heaven)
Heaven might be beneath you
Oooooh (Heaven heaven heaven)
If you just let go (let go let go)
You can touch heaven (you can touch heaven)
If you just let go (let go let go)
You can touch heaven (you can touch heaven)
(Heaven heaven heaven)

[?] trusting you

[?]
You need a second look into yourself
See what i do
You be the real you
I can see clearly
I can see that you need me
In all of the best ways
You make me feel safe
Heaven seems far away
Heaven ain't far away
Heaven seems far away
Heaven ain't far away

[Bridge: ????]
There is no time
Theres only love
Free to explore
All of the things we could be
[?]
Ill give you love
Love is my goal

[Verse 5: Jean Grae]
I've known that Heaven is a concept
Never needed a reverend to process
