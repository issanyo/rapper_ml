[Verse 1]
Everybody wants to be loved, so we -
Try again, try and get some company thugs
Like we work there, like we -
Are punking the system, getting jerked there
For the workload, and at your worst low
You reverse-breathe, forget your birthright
Forget your own worth, forget the first night
That you discovered how beautiful this art is
When you embarked on your journey to depart this
Normalized, formal-ass, formalized world
But to form your last words is, "The world" -
Is mine, is just the perfect line for us
Get us all, Scarface'd up
The relation of coming from nothing to everything
Does explain us, got nothing to do with drugs (in most cases)
Heart crises seem more superfluous
So it's the curse of us, and fuck dating us
Cause we some crazy motherfuckers, our natures
Don't call for being reined in more places
Than everywhere, bury it here, your pride, c'mon
Got nothing to lose, got nothing to prove
I define my place as homeostasis
With Chromeo bass riffs and "Homey don't play this"
But no, we won't play this, with tonys and geishas
With Kick-Ass and Hit Girl, lonely ovations
With phony oasises, Romeo playlists
Chrome to your faces (?)
Urban legend like a Chupacabra with the blah-blah
I know I don't exist, mute la palabra
Mutant demi-god, Zeus said that I was half-Artemis
Or maybe Aphrodite -- haven't lived half of my life, B
So I haven't decided yet who's inside of me
Pause--everything
And I don't really want to choose anything
If I have to; semi-automatic wedding ring
To shoot through these blues with a dude who
Makes the days less fuckery-infused
I'm trying to tell your people to fuck with this cruise
You just want tomfoolery
And I'm not who you are, or who I used to be
I'm not every day, I'm not usually
