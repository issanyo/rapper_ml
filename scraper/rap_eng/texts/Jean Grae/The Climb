[Intro]
Left foot on, right foot on
You gotta climb
You gotta climb
Left foot on, right foot on
You gotta climb
One, two, three, four, five, six, uh, uh

[Verse]
On my first step taken I was shaky on the ground
But I left a footprint that was so deep
That when the second step came I got ready fame
'Cause everybody knew me as the heavy foot queen
Third step heard a rep that the girl stomp hard
God damn, Godzilla-like, you gotta feel her right
Shakin' your soul until the sixth done step in
I reckon it was all like wrecking balls
Door smashed in, hot floor starts cracking to four
At five, I was terrorizing neighborhoods
On the news live, fucking up your cable good
Every station I'm on makes Grae an icon
Buckle up the straps on my mary janes, I'm gone
(Two two two) To be exact
Mean the straps for the sixth step pavement crack
Before my foot was even laid I created a crater
So wide that the seventh step wavered, teetered
So I had to learn to levitate (Eight) big shiva
If earth can't hold up my weight then I'll leave her
(Nine) The first steppin' air debonair deity
Rapping air freely direct to the Pleiades
(Ten) I remembered all the men below: perverts
Suckers ain't amazing when they catch you with an upskirt
Grabbing my dress and evanescing to eleven
Birding on the twelve, I'm up in the heavens
Trepidation at the superstition of thirteen
Revelation in my mind said I could burst free
But first divorce the forced thoughts that stall cause
And I ain't stop counting
