[Hook]
We flew into the rainbow of the city's crayon ruins
The colours splashed below us, glowing in the dark
And losing meaning by the day
I'm losing my head, but still giving my heart to you
And oh, how beautiful it seemed from a distance
With the moonlight glistening in awe
Of the silence, and the stillness
And the grace of it all

[Verse 1]
He said, "The sky's falling"
Took my hand in his, started running for the hills
Well not the literal hills
In little heels I was taking little spills along the sidewalk
People stumbling out of dive bars
I said, "What are you running for, I was having a good time
Weren't you having a good time baby? Won't you slow down and talk to me?"
But he said, "We can't slow down now, we just gotta go, babe"
We ran like we were floating on the waves of the concrete
Up East Houston, past the Bureau and the Mercury
I remember thinking, I'm glad I ordered no dessert for me
Passed the gas station, reached the steps of the F Train
Met change at the top of the stairs, I'm definitely
Confused-face emoticon
Then sighted a motorcade
We weren't even focussed on, slow fade into the sirens
Climbing, creeping down Broadway
Firemen lying on the corner of LaFayette
Fire hazard signs, we were peeping all the doorways
The environment of violence that appeared on the set
Like we were touring at the Paramount lot
Situation paramount, we turned and ran down the block
And the air raids rang out
People started running, and people started screaming
And the guns started banging from the rooftops
Bleeding civillians started to fall
The millions in New York didn't stop to help at all
And we ran, and we ducked, and weaved behind trucks
As the storefronts in SoHo started to blow their windows
Rejected impulses, we failed to save anyone
And a stray car just missed us on the way to hit a building
We were running past some neighbors passing them their children
And oh, the city's getting gassed from below
It's pouring down manholes, blowing, and
Wrapping shirts around my face and screaming
I said at sunrise, meet me back in Dumbo
Looked in his eyes, kissed his lips with our guns low
Tightened my sleeves around my neck and started bookin'
Towards the bridge, headed to the planet of Brooklyn
