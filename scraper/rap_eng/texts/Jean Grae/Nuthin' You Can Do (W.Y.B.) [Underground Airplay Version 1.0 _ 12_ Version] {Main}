[Intro: Mr. Metaphor]
Skeme Team, motherfuckers.  Word up, y’all better recognize once more.  Uh huh.  Coming in your cornerstore.  Word up, Mr. Mr. Metaphor.  Fuck that shit.  Do this shit live for the public, live for the people.  Building Block (Word is bond), Jean Grae, Pumpkinhead (Spit that shit)

[Verse 1: Block McCloud]
I need money.  Hungry, my stomach’s in knots.  Head’s
Full of rocks.  I’m shot—see me running from cops
Almost got knocked on some dumb shit coming from the spot
I’m Block, refuse to act like something I’m not.  I’ll fiend
To see the green like I’m Bill Bixby.  My style-shifting
Skills filthy.  Surprised my ho’s still with me
That’s me.  She dig the fact that I’m nasty
Brooklyn Ac' never went to class but we classy
Not a patsy.  The silent type to let the gat speak
She’ll stick with me unless she catch me with the next fat freak
Born ready.  You get torn by my machete
Silent, calm, and deadly medley.  Like Tom, I’m Petty
You’ll die for five bucks.  Why?  ‘Cause life sucks and I don’t
Give a fuck.  I’ll take that five bucks and live it up
Down some Thunderbird, wild out like I’m fucking disturbed
Then rob a herb.  Stepping to Block, you got a lot of nerve

[Hook: Block McCloud and Lil Leg-O (AKA L'ego Motif)]
If we
Scheme on your crew, you couldn’t tell a lie from the
Truth.  There ain’t nothing you could do.  You could
Watch your back, sleep with one eye open.  On the
Track, there ain’t nothing you could do.  I won’t
Lose no sleep.  Don’t snooze when I creep ‘cause
For real, there ain’t nothing you could do.  I could
Warn you, inform you that I’m upon you
Still, there ain’t nothing you could do

[Verse 2: Jean Grae]
Yo, I’ve been
Slept on for years, crept through Hell to get on
It’s straight drama when I’m lighting a song.  I’ll burn the steel off
The mic and melt it down, rock it as fronts, and roll L’s
In DAT labels when I’m smoking the blunts.  Jean, mother-
-fuckers, told y'all.  Ain’t quitting, spit butane
Flames shooting out the mouth.  Bounce it when I’m down South
Rep it when I’m East Coast, throw it when I’m West Side
Toast it when I’m Midwest, packing shit, Columbine
Poison ivy.  Fucking with niggas just a hobby
Deadly and probably, when I’m shining, y'all want to rob me.  Niggas
Rock Timbs dirty, jeans baggy.  Fam rowdy all
Day.  Still doubt me, run your mouth, talk about me
What?

[Verse 3: Mr. Metaphor]
Yo, yo, yo.  I’ll take
The time out of day and stash an hour away (Uh huh)
Use about five minutes to devour my prey (Right)
Forty-five more just collecting my pay (Tell ‘em)
Ten more minutes, put the check in the bank (Give me that!).  A lot
Of kids lack respect.  They’re neglecting to thank the cats
Who put 'em on, the people representing this thing (Uh huh).  I’m trying
To step in the ring (Uh huh).  I want the head of the king (Right).  I want
His crown and his jewels and his neck in a sling (Fuck that).  I want
Everything.  I want sex and a drink (Pour that).  I want
A Lex and a link (Uh huh).  I want a section to think (Yeah).  And for
My moms, I want a dress and a mink, a mansion, a yacht
A double dishwasher, no more mess in the sink.  What I
Project in a blink of an eye, you couldn’t wink.  And when I
Rise, I’m rising high to the sky—you gon’ sink.  And if I
Smell, it’s the weed, son.  Take a bath—you stink
And don’t ask me no advice—you’re better off asking a shrink
