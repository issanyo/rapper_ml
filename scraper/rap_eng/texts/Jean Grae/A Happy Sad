[Intro]
Never jump into a pile of leaves with a wet sucker
Say Charlie Brown, I've got a football, how about practicing a few place kicks?
I'll hold the ball, and you come running and kick it

Oh Brother
I don't mind your dishonesty half as much as I mind your opinion of me
You must think I'm stupid

[Verse 1]
No one understand me not even my fuckin' family like stand with me
My problem is the one I can't see
Can't be the only person livin' this cynicism free
If I am, imma be the spark in a sea of trees
I can't be
Voice for the generation get it now, get it how, I can only hear the sounds of my head, they too loud
Nah nah, they too quiet
Guess my only option is to silence the impending riot
And pen the violence covered in the color turbulence
And what my current state of mind
Is where do I find the map?
That say where I be at
Because it really doesn't matter if its this or that
And it, really doesn't matter if its this or that
It's all the same price, so get it how you like and matter o' fact
Imma ride my bike and fly a kite
Tryna turn off the light that was on, singin'
Sunshine sunshine always fine, feel it in my skin, warmin' up my ass crack
And you can have it back, wanna take it back but I need a paper bag to just
Hold all my sunshine in it, then I just kick it, with my friends and, its terrific
Never have I felt so lonely be-fore

[Hook]
I got sunshine, in a bag, and I'm happy, that I'm sad(x3)
I got sunshine, in a bag, and I'm happy, happy (that i'm sad)

[Verse 2]
I was a caramel parallel away from hell
A speak n spell divine that my minds workin' well
Soul doesn't sell, despite what they say
Now see in black and white but I paint the picture grey with the easel
Colors fall down to the beautiful people
On the corner whom I've never seen
But they see me, lookin' to me in stupid ways
I can't, let 'em down yo I can't let em down ah
But none of my horoscopes come true
And every cookie fortune tellin' me what to do
Define happiness is not what I woulda done
Never would I face it usually I would just run
Use a paper bag to hold all my sunshine in it
I just kick it with my friends and feel stupendous
But this is just how it is and this is how I live
Guess I can't go back guess I can't go back
Dreads don't grow back if I cut 'em off with scissorhands
And that's how I feel when that is my grand master plan
But just to know that you know that I know that we'll be fine and everything will be alright

[Outro]
What, what
I wrote a lot of fuckin' lyrics to this song, but I don't (???)

Oh come on, Charlie Brown
No
I'll hold it steady
No
Please
You just want me to come running up to kick that ball, so you can pull it away and see me lie flat on my back and kill myself
This time you can trust me
See?
Here's a signed document, testifying that I promise not to pull it away
It is signed
It's a signed document
I guess if you have a signed document in your possession, you canâ€™t go wrong
This year I am really going to kick that football
Peculiar thing about this document, it was never notarized
