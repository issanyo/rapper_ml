[Hook]
I rock on and on and on and on
And niggas ain't leaving til six in the morning
I rock on and on and on and on
That's right, they go on and on and on and on
I rock on and on and on and on
And the niggas ain't leaving til six in the morning
I rock on and on and on and on
Ah, come on, Greasy

[Verse 1]
Took a little time but brought
It back for the real heads
Feels real good to be
Back in the building
The lack of the spectacular
Was crushing your soul yeah
Miraculous the lack of risk
Amongst all the foes here
The awesomest of misses
New submission to history, reminiscing on
The generations pissing in Dixie, cups
I carry with me, all the souls, so the kids be
Atta girl go getters, incredible "know the ledges" broads
I'm a legend, call John, nigga ask him
And every motherfucker's taking bronze rapping
With Jeannie on a track it's really leaning to harassment
Am I wrong class, NO
I'm an original iconoclast, monotone
Monochrome clothes, with her mama's ass
Sly Stone, Everyday People
Colon comma dash
That's a profile of me as an emoticon
I know it's clever baby, because I wrote the song

[Hook]
I rock on and on and on and on
And the niggas ain't leaving til six in the morning
I rock on and on and on and on
That's right, now come on
I rock on and on and on and on
And the niggas ain't leaving til six in the morning
I rock on and on and on and on
Now come on

[Verse 2]
Every day I'm unmistakably high-er
You would think I had some coke or mary jane
On my rider, nope
Only dope is fire up is blokes that I rival
Even though they mostly hate the quotes they know they inspire
I'm too dope to retire
I'm too broke to be tired
I'm supposed to be flyer, not remotely weak either
Climbing over these liars laying lower each lineup
Rhyming over reason find her praying rosary kind of, like
Miners, Chil√©
Divine bust, really
The rhymes blessed, dressed as the madonna
With frilly, ruffled black lace gloves
And tucking a macmilly, in her clutch bag actually
What's so bad? Blasphemy?
Kill me then, silly
I'll sell more records, and
Still be getting busy
The afterlife beckons with the cash I reckon
Maul y'all like wrecking balls, y'all better recognize
Bad when you see it y'all

[Hook]
I rock on and on and on and on
And the niggas ain't leaving til six in the morning
I rock on and on and on and on
Now come on, that's right
I rock on and on and on and on
And the niggas ain't leaving til six in the morning
I rock on and on and on and on
Now come on

[Verse 3]
You don't really wanna say "fuck Jean" right?
Cause I'm the motherfucking (A) A+ dean type
To make a ruckus then blame it on all the
(B) B's (C) seize, (D) deez nuts, bitches, these stunts
(E) Ease back man
(F) Eff y'all I'm a G
(H)hate I, J, (K) 'kay, take the L with
(M)'em, fake N-O way
Please
Pass the (P) peas like they used to say
I'm Q in Juice, you (R)are (S)escargot
Snail pace, you gon' fail the race
I (T)tee off
(U)You stay sub par
You got your V out, at the W bar
(X) Xavier's school is where I'm laying my head
Talented, yes gifted, is the Grae with the pen
(Y) Why... say less I stay in the best
Listed top ten while you drift into (Z)zed
I'm Zen

[Outro]
I rock on and on and on and on
And the niggas ain't leaving til six in the morning
But probably five
Because six is entirely too late
