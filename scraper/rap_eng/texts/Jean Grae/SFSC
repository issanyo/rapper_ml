Seem so composed, I know the notes I wrote in theory
Repose...
I wish I knew more often than I take itâ€¦ nearly

Laid in between the sheets in discord of who I am and what my colors bleed
And in the end I know you'll never give me all the things I need

So far, so close, so far
So close
So far, so close
So far, so close

I know I pick the bones I could have left alone...
In theory
No one has traveled this road even though they still stand near me
Caught in between hope and a dream
Though it seems to most that I can see it
Most of these days, morning rays, I've come to deathly fear them
I'm...

There's always tomorrow
There's always tomorrow
There's always tomorrow

There's always tomorrow
There's always tomorrow
There's always tomorrow
