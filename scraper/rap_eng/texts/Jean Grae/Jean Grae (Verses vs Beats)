[Intro: Jean Grae]
Yo.  Jean Grae.  All day, everyday.  What’s up to Blowout?  Y’all niggas, you know, wipe your noses, get the snow.  Ain’t none of that up in here.  Heh

[Verse 1: Jean Grae]
We walk the street, shine, shimmer, glimmer, sparkle like a thousand winters
Distant like Northern Lights and glisten when upon the mic
Strike back, aim to shoot the fair fight—no pistols.  Only
Verbal slugs.  Slanging like we playing dope wars with drugs
Words are Celestine Prophecy.  Minds are riddled
With poetic hollow tips and archangels is out of clips
I’m half-empty like a pessimistic glass
Water tainted with the blood and flesh of past.  I claim to be some
Mind expansion like on marijuana.  Persona’s a magnet for drama
Shit that never stops fully—it’s just a comma.  I’m the
Exception to the quota, all out of order
Beyond category, my story’s an aura
Keep my oratory fact-ridden.  Told a million tales
With the form of a MAC spitting.  Spill my scriptures forth
Like blasphemous accidents.  Body far from masculine
But I’m equipped with the strength of a thousand mortal, massive men
Mosaic art pattern, rap locksmith, head of an ostrich
Grounded with knowledge.  Valedictorian: Life College
Associated with street scholars, blue-collar criminals
Japan to Hollis, people’ll move illegal for their dollars
Hustlers make the world spin.  Flow turns to monetary
Love only gets you so far.  Commentary
Reflecting personal repertoire.  It’s nonfiction
On the highest level and praise God but live a devil’s life
When I pass, I’ll dream about what Heaven’s like.  God created
Man and Earth, then rested, created me on the seventh night
I’m like Aurora Borealis, red Northern Lights
Find me in your southern climates.  Ongoing like the time is
So fuck you.  I write for pages—fuck one-liners
Age thirty plus eighteen, twenty-five minus
Y’all niggas figure it out.  No doubt
What?  What?
