Welcome back to Everything's Fine—the game show where there's only one answer to everything. Time to meet our contestants! Let's welcome back last week's champion: Frank. Frank is currently flying high on every drug imaginable just to cope with the day-to-day stresses of surviving in modern times. How are you doing, Frank?

[Frank (Quelle Chris)]
Everything's fine.

That's just super! Our next contestant is Jess. Jess cries herself to sleep every night, has just adopted twenty-seven cats, has a Masters degree in Fine Arts, and has been unemployed for 15 years. Jess, you look great, but more importantly—how you doing today?

[Jess (JG)]
Everything's fine.

Okie-dokies. And last but not least, we have Eltron 8000. Eltron has been sent from the future to warn us of impending war, controlled genocide, disease, famine, drought, natural disasters, technological takeover, and the ultimate destruction of the planet Earth. I'm so glad you could join us. Just one question before we start today's show: how are you doing today, Eltron?

[Eltron 8000 (QC)]
Everything is fine.
