[Spoken: Quelle Chris]
Well, hello there
Today's tale takes place in a small little town called New York City
So tiny if you blink, you might just miss it
But I digress
How 'bout you go and sit on back
And I'll play you a little tune while my good buddy Jean here sings you a song
Heck, you may just learn a thing or two

[Jean Grae]
It's as cold as a witch's tit that winter day today
When I'm texting my friends [?]
We have learned to meet downtown to break some bread
It was Ann and Vern and Mary Ann all on the thread
When we sat and laughed and ate and drank and hung around for hours
Stayed 'till after closing and we broke out our guitars
So for the life and love of music, bourbon, and good food
Took so many pictures, not to save them would be rude
Woke up down for sunset the next day
Charged my phone with all the pictures right away
(Ha ha, Instagram!)
I was so happy we could share [?]
So I cropped them, builded them, tilted through them down
And then posted a caption [?]
And please be a normal person, don't be negative
We had such a great time, and then I put the name of the restaurant
And then, so you guys could have a similar experience if you want
(Your welcome!)
One hundred and ten people posted likes
And Mary Ann, Vern, and Anna all reposted thrice
But then some stupid dick who doesn't know how to read
Typed "four roses is garbage, you already have to leave"
(Bitch!)
You don't have to drink what's in the picture
It's a digital representation of my time
Unless you get your nutrients from other people's lives
You don't have to drink what's in the picture
And you don't have to eat what's in the picture
Goddamnit, this is just something that I enjoyed in life
If you fuckin' don't like food, then a post and here's some nudes
You don't have to eat the fuckin' picture
Don't have to eat what's in the picture
Ooh-ooh
You don't have to eat the fuckin' picture
