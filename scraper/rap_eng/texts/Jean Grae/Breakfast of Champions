[Intro]
Ma'am?
Shots fired
Shots fired
Shots fired
Shots fired

[Verse 1: Quelle Chris]
I woke up, ate my breakfast, a plate full of posts and texts
Saw somebody else got shot up, this time by some cops in Texas or Virginia
Can’t remember, can't keep count
They rope a doping, tryna wear down my emotions
B-but if they just abided they'd be cool
If they say "jump" you say "how high?"
You know what's wrong, you say alright, and don't you look them in the eyes, boy
Be quiet, boy, sound familiar huh boy? (Pause)
Or you'll find yourself quote-unquote martyred for the cause
A mural on the wall
A hashtag for teen white kids to troll for angry response
It's bound to wreck your body or straight burn your body out
It's bound to wreck your body or straight burn your body out
You just another angry nigga shoutin', what you pressin'?
Why you poutin'?
Why we singing 'We Shall Overcome' in the 2000s?
Devil's tryna turn this car around, but we’ve been asking "are we there yet?" for the last 400 miles

[Chorus: Quelle Chris]
Like fuck, damn, shit, wow
It's bound to wreck your body or straight burn your body out
It's bound to wreck your body or straight burn your body out
It's bound to wreck your body or straight burn your body out
Like damn, shit, fuck, wow
It's bound to wreck your body or straight burn your body out
It's bound to wreck your body or straight burn your body out
(Alright) It's bound to wreck your body or straight burn your body out

[Verse 2: Jean Grae]
Woke up in a cold sweat, drenched like I'm Ronald in a Genesis
Spent and I haven't even been awake for minutes
And in these times sometimes I think it's better with religion
An invisible man and he can quantify the pain we're given
Survivin', 'cause survivin' ain't the same as really livin'
Teach the babies that, please educate the children
Freeze, now they on the concrete pleadin' for forgiveness
I don't know what kind of litmus test this shit is, but dig this
It beats your body down and straight burns your body out
So you're wasting time just caterin' to pain, party down
Gettin' through the day-to-day to maintain is hard as hell
It ain't fuckin' fair, it's not just "get over it" over or get over it sober
Nobody's past the quotas and nobody's past agendas
Just hard to sing some lullabies to sleep
When they pumping in your, pumping in your, pumping in your jeep
Shots fired, shots fired
It ain't I'm not a warrior, bitch I'm Dora Milaje
My mother was a freedom fighter like writer Aja Monet
I'm a well-seasoned veteran no way, I don't need OJ
To get off on some murders, I need veteran racists off pay, and in jail
But the bastards seem to linger like some chemtrails
Children called they mamas while they stared at daddy's entrails
C'mon, how much more evidence you want?
You think you could use your privilege like a human shield in front?
Without the Pepsi, miss me
I pray the bullets miss me, but you not about that life
So let me tell you how this shit be

[Chorus: Jean Grae]
It's like fuck, damn, shit wow
It's bound to wreck your body or straight burn your body out
It's bound to wreck your body or straight burn your body out
I said it's bound to wreck your body or straight burn your body out
It's like damn, shit, fuck, wow
It's bound to wreck your body or straight burn your body out
It's bound to wreck your body or straight burn your body out
It's bound to wreck your body or straight burn your body out
