[Verse 1]
My caramel mahogany fairy tale
He gon' do very well
Fearing for the farewell, stay awhile
We could just lay awhile
See me smile better
Lean your chest on me, make you my sweater
I want the rest of you
Pressing me head-up, I need contact
Your windows reflecting me back
Later I ask where your memories at
Your face telling me that
You need a taste, where the Hennessey's at
C'mon, lace me
Replace glasses with the tip of my tongue
I won't front baby, lady is sprung
And though relation is young
I feel us making a connection beyond
So that I (ssssss) like a chick in a saun'
No lie, won't I
Take my time, let the bass unwind
Claymation couldn't mold a better mind, you're sick
And I'll be the nurse and you be the patient
Boy, how insane could it get
You so high, baby

[Hook]
High, you're making me so
High, you're getting me so
High, c'mon
High, you're making me so
High, baby I'm
So high off your love, ooh, ooh

[Verse 2]
Okay, turn the lights out
No turn 'em back on
Want you to see my backbone and my black tone
Start minimal, raise it to animal please
You're no amateur, please me I'm tangible
Knees be all tangled up, like the handles
Placed on the mantle, that romantic angles
We'll slow dance til tangoing gets horizontal
I know you go longer than flows with no comma
I'm high on ya, you like it don't cha
Could survive by just biting on ya
Like those, high notes, nibble just a little bit
Everything I'm thinking you're already delivering it
Quiver, pleasure unheard
You ain't even done first baby when I done burst
Crazy I'm in love thirst, you are the quencher
Maybe we should be taping so you can remember
I'm just saying

[Refrain x2]

[Outro]
High, you're making me so
You're making me so - high
I'm getting so - high
Baby, high off
Why not
Stop, okay
Don't stop
It's loud, c'mon
Not there, not there
Ooh, oh baby, don't do that
Don't do that
