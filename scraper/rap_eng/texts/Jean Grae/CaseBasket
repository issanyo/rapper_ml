[Verse 1]
Hold up -- wordsmith, Blacksmith
Girl in the school parking lot with a fat spliff
Old shit, full circle, Bob Barker, back flips
Got mad rap kids but not a Catholic
Preaching that gospel, not Baptist
Redesign placements, nos-ag-stic
Getting too crazy? My bad, shit
Right, you ain't lazy, I'm bat shit
Basket case, you can blame me, it's the madness
J.G., congrats, bitch
In rap's last place, so the vantage point's dangerous
A black ditch underground cave where the canvas
Is the wall around me stained with my blood and my fans' pics
A motherfucker with nothing to lose is a bad bitch
Misconstrued, miss my aim, you lose
Kiss the shoes, diss my name, hiss, boos
Your clique is fools, fucking with niggas and jigaboos
I'm sick of buffoons, fucking sick of thinking of coons
I ain't ever dig a rule, or kick a particular tune
I'm penning its venting me nicotine, liquor, and booze
I'm me, choose choice, it's the new shit
Don't be confused, boys, the new shtick is no shtick -- promote this
Offbeat, off road shit, with a Kotex
Flow mo heavy than most chicks
So fuck a 28 days -- I keep a Tampax with my show shit
Right next to an open bottle reekin' of roses
Next to a broken bottle seepin' leakin' neurosis
Sleeping on Jeannie? Most is?
Most ears ain't heard of the beating, cause I'd be most feared
See, it's more convenient to leave me alone in the background
Blacked out, in a basement with a gagged mouth
I ain't want nobody to save me, I'll hack out
Shawshank redemption, no thanks to mention
Act now, get a special deal on the raps out
For free 99 I'll beat 99 acts down
But leave one please, I need a comedy track clown
Your beats jokes relief, hope you finally go that route
If thee is next to Tsidi don't act out
I'm a phe-no-me-non, retarded don like my mommy done crack (wow)
A super jerk, call me Clark Kent at sperm bank with girl mags
I'd be like SPIT if I burned tags
I burn flags, burn, man, not books or bras, fam
Swing bars, multiple partners, Tarzan
Marzipan, that's it, no reference, no depth shit
Breathe and let the bars stand
