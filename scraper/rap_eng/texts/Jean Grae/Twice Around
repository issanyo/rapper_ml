[Verse 1]
Man, life got me
Up once and caught up in circles
Trace sloppy
Paint with no numbers
OPriginal copy
Jean the rapper, miss Grae
Yes, I is
Maintainin' inside the state of the biz
All grown up now
Thicker like a fifty and a buck now
Mama so proud (hey, all right)
And my baby love me long time (for life)
Ain't it crazy how we always find this shit when we ain't looking (watch out)
Cop that album that dropped and go knock that
Set your clock back to ill
Throw on your shell toes
Step with me (forward though)
Finally see the light
Some of my dreams are right
Thank you all for let me build with y'all
Lettin' me spill my guts and chill
It's all just a little too much
A minute of touching word is enough[?]
Literally, speechless I am

[Chorus]
So we all grown up now
Been through hard times
Seen the world twice around
Word, so young and so old
Such a child, so grown
But it only feels like a day
We all grown up now
Been through hard times
Seen the world twice around
Word, so young and so old
Such a child, so grown
But it only feels like a day

[Verse 2]
Better run and get your writers[?] and sun screen
I am running until I can't stop
And kneecaps pop in socket (owe!)
Then I drop and crawl
And when my skin wares thin (what)
I roll
And throw my self up hill (shit)
And tuck and duck
Anything you throwing at me (uha)
Clap me
Stab me
Rat me out
Come at me
Call me out
Slap me
Punch me (c'mon!)
Make me happy
I just turn it around
Use all that shit (you)
Reviewers who skewered my name (mmhmm)
The cat spits next lp
Aim, click, blow out your brain, that's it
Gunning hard for mother fuckers like Alabar Wayne[?]
That's gangsta forty

[Chorus]
So we all grown up now
Been through hard times
Seen the world twice around
Word, so young and so old
Such a child, so grown
But it only feels like a day
We all grown up now
Been through hard times
Seen the world twice around
Word, so young and so old
Such a child, so grown
But it only feels like a day

[verse 3]
So, I, miss Grea
Wanna just say (what!?)
I gotta say thank you again
It's been six years from the blend (not work[?])
Can't you do it again
Hold tight
Stay right
Just believe in me
I got your back baby
Lean on me
Your gonna be alright
We're gonna be alright

So, I, miss Grea

We're gonna be alright


[Chorus]
So we all grown up now

Seen the world twice around
Word, so young and so old
Such a child, so grown
But it only feels like a day
