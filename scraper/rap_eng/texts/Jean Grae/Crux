[Verse:]
Bad employees [x2]
Ain’t good employees
So true

Let’s get it straight
They employees I’m the boss
Edison grain Himalayan salt
Bars act as medicine man laying hands
Contact niggas a brand to maintain fans
I’m prone to darker thoughts and Peter Parker witticism
Known to target more than people gone to prison system
Women carcuses burned and park and earned on a mantle
I’ll still be the hardest worker just a shift in prisons
I’ve always been a prophet conjurer manifester
Better than 100% of them
Dentagrip in the hand of the better gent better than gentleman
Just presented the option of settling in
Back of the bus relegated like black slated
The lady with crack laid in the pages
Lack of phrases never
Hope that we’re trapped in a case together
Rorschach and Watchmen approach until and fall until their balls back in
Here’s a vodka toast for every hour on the hour
So I don’t go cop a toast
Michael Douglas falling down
I’m a Kings County resider with a bounty hunter on the sider
With the county call the [?]
Got a renaissance
Probably I’m a pass on the common class
Mosque and synagogue
Now we into simpletons
Spin a call spin it thin
Finnegan begin again
Optimism was wearing thin even on thicker carotin
The caring is a barren ain’t it
Call stress related aging and immortal babies
Morbid thoughts that separate you from your moral cause
But serenade and show them all the born creators
That’s why now I got to call the blond girls with pom poms
With their mom’s pearls at the prom
With the promise of going to good colleges to bond
On a scholarship
Dad’s in the Klan
My family’s into politics
I’ll choke with tampon strings
Smoke over your body while some asshole sings
I’m really not a part of your party
You’re grasping for mercy
I don’t have any personally ask him

*Listen I really can’t help you I gotta
See now I’m late
Now I’m late to do the hook
Now I just gotta just do pushups until the next verse
Alright really just shut up*
Oh that burns one hand
Let’s go*

Was always Rosewood pissed off permanent bitch slaps
Doing the birdman hand rub and six packs
And a van passed and to see you wearing a calf tan
Blaring the gap man covers a scat man
Unreasonable tin foil hat flow
Rap so blacks don’t back pedal to crack hoes
Mother land ex pat
Ex lax lexicon broad
When I land my jets to concourse
No pedestrians on board
Brontosaurus various ignoring the words to the chorus
So your morals hurt more like slipping on marbles
Non-carpeted long ass mall corridors
All mall smokes at hole in the wall bars
Sipping a long dog flipping off all y’all
Yeah that’s all I got jokes in bars
And I boast those joke
While you hope and costar
Praying like a space ghost coast to coast star
Ricky Lake and Lakos hosting postcards
Go-karts and Nascar reason for blowdarts
Big n*ggas old time
No I don’t spar
I’ll be at my Metamucil age refusing medicine
But then a tending to my linens
A gentleman good evening
Following my bereavement is a team challenge
Valance valor cadence patience manners
Basic etiquette relevant rhetoric brander
A reverent benevolent banter
Gallous gracious
Panoramic picture painter
Realist escapist
Defendant never plaintiff
I don’t need to fucking claim shit
I own shit that own shit
Jessica Tandy prone shit
Jennifer Hanner
Get a home bitch
Get the fuck out of mine
You the fuck out of line
You don’t even know how the fuck to rhyme
Come on yeah go on
Calling the fuzz calling your cousins
I want them running and fucking buzz
I’ve had a dozen a  feathering
I fucking live trucks
I’m Bugs Bunny with dutch ovens on my knuckles
[inaudible 3:52-2:56]
I’m the last mother fucking standing
You don’t wanna brash hands
Wait I was trying to say
Lunatic brass pants
Lunatic brass pants that’s my new alias
That’s what I got lunatic brass pants
You’re not putting the beat back on
What are you doing to the microphone
I see your point
