Le sigh...
Butterflies and sunshine baby
I can tell that nature loves you
Not as much I do lately
You chase all my clouds away
I'm never go let of ya
Happiness is all around me
Let's run away and build a family
We can catch a flight today

You fit like the pieces in the puzzle
I've been missing
You feel like I always wanna hug you
When we're kissing

I just wanna get much closer
But it seems so far away
You could be the one I keep forever
I'm kinda dreaming
It just be you and me together

I just wanna get much closer
I just wanna hear you say


DO ME DO ME
DO ME DO ME DO ME DO ME
DO ME DO ME
DO ME DO ME DO ME DO ME

Chilling on an island somewhere
Hummingbird upon my shoulder
Holding on to your hand dearly
Walking in the sunset breeze

Writing my name with yours and
Don't you think it seems so perfect
Everything seems so perfect
We could do this endlessly

You fit like the pieces in the puzzle
I've been missing
You feel like I always wanna hug you
When we're kissing

I just wanna get much closer
But it seems so far away
You could be the one I keep forever
I'm kinda dreaming
It just be you and me together

I really wanna get much closer
Really wanna hear you say


DO ME DO ME
DO ME DO ME DO ME DO ME
DO ME DO ME
DO ME DO ME DO ME DO ME
