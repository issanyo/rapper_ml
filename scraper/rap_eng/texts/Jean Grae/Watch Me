[Verse 1}
Ok, guess I gotta go back to basics, like I’m back wearing Asics
That my mama bought me, I'm glad that my mama taught me
How to be a stronger person, when the time was urgent
I got the dirt up off me like a box of Tide detergent
Just watch me, niggas watch me now
Better watch out the mouth is more proper niggas spladow
A splash on you is a Tom Hanks and Daryl Hannah
Was just implanted in my memory banks, Atlanta
Up to Canada then back home to South Africa
Thanks for widening the buzz diameter
Cause, let's do damage, competition meet your challenger
Losses zero and I still floss with no dinero
Apparel stay crisp though, kicks to pimp
The mixed chick with the equivalent of sulfuric spit
The hung juries split the tongues fury is guilty
But I'm just too cute to be considered this filthy
Industry can't milk me, They mad that they ain’t built me (god dammit)
My stamina’s at the status of can't kill me
A catastrophic cat on any topic
I'm toxic like Whitney and Bobby's blood, stop it

[Hook]
We all came in this life with one mission
And I plan to grind till mine kicks in, watch me
Can't stop me, or hold me back, nor pop me, now hold me fresh
That’s not probably, the best lie I sold you that
Silly J then the G nigga spray like a mack milly
Back up off me, before you get slapped
Will she back out? Ever put the mic down?
Never, watch me

[Verse 2]
It goes one for the beat (c’mon)
Two for the real (what)
Cats had never slept on the fact that Jean was ill
Lend me your eardrums friends
A couple spins in your Hummer Benz
Circle round your hood till it’s bubbling (I told ya'll,damn)
Triple fat bubblegoose as Jean's been
Trouble ever since the blackboards got useless
Truth is, school was just another tool to learn the vocab
To approach the world better, peers shuttering coach bags
Get the fuck on with that girl
I roast your asses like Friar’s Club toasters get most embarrassed
Fuck your four lashes
Jean'll rock some phony glasses and just stunt like they glowing with carrots
So what bastards, I don't roll with amateurs, niggas or vets
Like in our spare time we can’t put pets in
And ah yes, I'm marvelous thanks for asking
So smashing about to get talked about like the Passions coming attractions

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Get your life straight (man), I'm not a lightweight (and)
I'm not referring to the pounds on the 5’8”
Structure please watch me, rupture these clique circles
Bully's burst like a muscle yanking on a heavy pully
First, ones called cooly used to be as unruly as son dooby in a porn movie with four whore groupies
Maybe that's reaching, I was a fast heathen
Couldn't catch me like I’m Tootie on them skates back in Eastland
I'm a derailed train, a females pain
Giving birth while the head nurse gives her husband brain
I'm worser than curse words written in cursors
I'm Dear John letters held them palms a sweating
You Gerber babies gerble on, Jean’s grown folk
But I’ll still throw a stick in your bike spokes, for choke dick
It’s time to get these keys and blocks like whip
I'm not mean but I’ll stomp like a brick at compost, shit

[Hook]
