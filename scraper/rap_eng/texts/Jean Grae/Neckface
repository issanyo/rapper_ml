Man, it's business as usual
But trap pubical dirt, that's beautiful
Pass me you'll see Rasputin at work
A fast, furious, mad curious mind
Slant Manchurian eyes
Slap jaw, give a hacksaw lover
Burgle a bank robber
Bumble his plan, invert his revolver
Body bag and tag anonymous man
Brag? I promise to
I'mma do shit that makes you wish you would've been
The human shield for Amadou
Bitch please, my sixteen spit pristine
Like the mouth on a debutante named Christine
Jean, hurricane name, unattained fame, fuck it
My son will be the son of a dame who changed the game, fucker

From the basement to the Kay Slay shit
Lace it, rap braided me a friendship bracelet
You lose, I'm just lukewarm
My true form will be revealed in a few years
When the phoenix swarms
I'm three steps ahead of you, please flex
The medical needs of need next just to breathe jeez god bless
Accomplice none, I'm complex, son
The confidence of Donald Trump mixed with a convict on the run
Compliments of my mama, Miss Benjamin
School teacher slash singer slash rule preacher
Who bet against her daughter being weaker than her
Praise right, trained like fight back Tsidi
So I'm quite likely to strike back (damn right)
I ain't easy to stomach I make them queasy from it
See Greasy causin' discomfort but yo you see they love it

And I'm not threatening y'all yet
The call y'all get is late fall, 2004, bet

Hold up, I sip an XO and then
Scratch out your eyes like I'm playing tic toe with them
Black pride promoting it, but crass when spoken
The Neckface of rap, only New York niggas get that
Tag reference, stash weapons with some brash methods
'Til you shitting brass knuckles
And your ass pucker's past tense
I execute so effortless, the cleverness
Misconstrued as ambivalence, you imbeciles
High level ground, I'm small
But I walk on you heavy George Jefferson, Bentley
Eventually you'll get it, potentially a legend
Dispense of me never, they'll mention me forever

You wanna turn the other cheek in disgust
You'll learn Jean Greasy to trust, follow the leader
