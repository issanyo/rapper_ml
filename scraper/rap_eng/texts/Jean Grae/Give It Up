[Verse one]
See I was born in a zephyr, bitch
West wind terrorist
Archangel, left wing clipped off by the seraphims
Right wing sickened when the lightning struck it
So I flew against the sun until it lightened me from it
I'm unlikely to covet what you hype from your gullet
I'm more the type to re-dub it
Yours is trifling rubbish
So under this game my name should have a hyphen above it
When I break, push its hymen all the way to its stomach
Insane hard drive as if the AKA's Lacey
And the track was [?]
And the rap is a magnum
Or the rap is a handgun and the track is Thelma
The AKA is Louise and then I'm back with [?]
Gatling spitter, eat you cats for dinner
Like I'm Jean Yun-fat
Cooking rice in the back
Still, uh, deciphering that?
Killer, a Ku Klux blue blood
Filling their wardrobes until their shoes flood with loose guts
Ruthless as those people DeVito was with
You sluts take it off, I've been dressed ever since
Blessing this canvas better than priests in a sketching class
Sipping on holy water, dipping in watercolors
Gracious Grae, thicker than Tom Selleck's facial hair
Wait there, Jean'll remake you like Cape Fear
I'll take a cream pie and rub it 'til your face smeared
My sense of humour's intense, the cure would be death
But I'm the sixth sense so, death isn't sure yet
(Hey! Don't give 'em no more!)
What you stopping me for?
(These niggas ain't ready for Greasy just to lay down the law for sure!)

[Hook]{x2}
I run through your hood with my middle finger up
I'm that good, that sure
Nigga, yeah, what?
I'm that ill, that girl, man, give it up
(She's bad, she's bad, she's bad, she's bad)
