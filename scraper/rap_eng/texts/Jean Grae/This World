[Verse]
Man
Brothers they wilding on account of me ripping the truth
Flipping positions, missions written man I'm living proof
I took the mittens off
I'm slugging open fist
Shadowbox, slap boxing "this world" ain't shit
The double standards are driving me I'm mechanical now
The catalog is gradually bigger, annually
I'm a door breaker downer, law disobeyer
Crowd around her and all for simply saying "this world" need taming
I'm entertaining, yes attacking like Dick Cheney's chest
But lacking nuts so macadamia fuckers claim the best
It's not gon' last long
Homie I'm that strong
You gonna fuck up leaving "this world" past gone
I'm here to fuck perception
Right in it's 20/20 eye prescription
Leaving it blinded you should've brought protection
Watch your necks I'm sneaking up behind you
Like the tax in checks all of "this world" you're next

[Hook]
Y'all wanna let me in then you wanna change me up
Man, how the fuck you think you're ever gonna play me up?
You can't play me out, y'all just acting crazy now
I'll be doing Jeanie until "this world" fades out

[Verse Two]
Pass me on your block will ya
Know what I got for ya
A million stories and albums that never rock fillers
You like to cock fellas
Give them some accapellas
Never, ever, ever up in "this world" of y'all killers
Please, I'm 'bout to show you the meaning of work
Affirmative Jeanie's Action you can see if I dirt
And leave 'em bleeding and gasping like they're Jesus on wood
I wish I would get a reaction for all of "this world"...good
Controversy works and plus I got a pussy
But even with that, people scared to push me, who's a pussy first?
A fucking hearse you'll have to share a space with
I'll get used to rocking ankle bracelets
Changed it, shit

[Hook]

[Verse Three]
Damn, y'all scared of change like some nickels chasing you
Running with pistols shooting, reckless till they're staining you
In all directions I'm aiming straighter than missiles nigga
Fingers arranged, one for "this world" one on the trigger
Both of my hands up
With loaded hand guns
We're 'bout to make this such a notorious anthem
Vainglorious like we're still a part of the X-Clan
You don't want it sissy, I own "this world", next plan

[Hook]
