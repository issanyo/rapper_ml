[Intro]
You shot me in the heart
Deep in my soul

[Verse]
Packed my favorite Mamba
S-A, S-A-D-A
Fifteen to forty rounds by relay
Dos trejo pistol, esse
S.A. Mexico, model uno
Treinty dos, machine spray
Cobra, Rhodesia farmers, bush war, vintage
Nine millimeter blowback, partially dented
Sanna 77 the apartheid weapon
Nine by nineteen millimeter Parabellum
Single shots, forty round submachine
Open stock in owen gun
Only 50,000 built.  Owning one?
Priceless.  700 rounds a minute
Nine limbs an oodle, an Uzi, a Sterling, a spector
Beretta model 3, Heckler-Koch, Mossberg Maverick
Mossberg Magnum, gun city Magnum pump action
Excalibur crossbow, an alloy javelin
(Wait, how'd that get in there? Shit happens)
A Barrett M-99 made in '99
Single-shot, bolt-action, weight 25 (hacked in)
A Barrett M-95 made in '95
Twenty-nine inch barrel, five round box magazine
Rager automatic rifle, 1940 Cape Town
Gas action ten round, iron sight on a mount
Base a machine gun, United Kingdom
Used by island Mark 3, I'll fire one
AR-832 Italian, send Marco battalion
Never-used AVB 762
Musco 225 large caliber
910 Blunderbuss, check your Britannica
Enter the building, mask quick, block the cameras
Trap the elevator shaft off with gas canisters
Backpack thrown over both of the black banisters
Wracked with panic, that's advantage, I manage it
Two stairs at a time, flew it and climb
Flew in the door, and the door marked 9
I marked time on the watch says
Time on the watch, man, I
Crept low like I'm cheating
I blow the door, bereavement
I wish I could have changed my feelings
I wish my wrist wasn't raising even
I wish, babe, that you wasn't a raving heathen
And I hope the plain bitch was amazing -- we even
