Moonlight shattered on this stretch of sea
How many times I've stood here mapping things out differently
But I can't go back
No, I can't go back

Cross the road and run back to the town
How many times I've run this way, and how it runs me down
But I can't go back
No, I can't go back

Well my heart is speeding, and the days go by
And my hands are bleeding - nobody wonders why
And all it's earned me since that day
Well, I might just give it away
But I can't go back
No, I can't go back

We held our fortunes in a paper cup
How many drops drip-dripped away until it dried me up
But I can't go back
No, I can't go back

Well, the stars are burning, and the days go by
And the world keeps turning - I don't wonder why
And every good thing since that day
Well, I might just give it away
But I can't go back
No, I can't go back

Moonlight shattered on this stretch of sea
How many times I stood here mapping how it shattered me
But I can't go back
No, I can't go back
