[Intro: Jean Grae]
9th, 9th's got them beats that you just sing to for no reason
{*laughs*}
Sometimes you got to get to know yourself
You gotta travel a little bit
Look at yourself from another perspective
So I try to do that
Come on

[Verse 1: Jean Grae]
Listen, there's nothing like knowin' yourself
Like the way I know that the smoke has kind of broken my health
Like the way I know my flow don't make appropriate wealth
I can't change that
But, funny I'm sayin' that when it's money I'm aimed at
I give a fuck if you frame that or quote it (shit)
I meant what I said 'cause I wrote it—point noted
I know I'm overly sensitive when it comes to, well
Just about everything
And I'm so hardheaded—I don't need your help
Like no advice for these records 'less it's me and myself
Like, I don't ever want to breathe if it requires assistance
Just, just shut down my system
I'm a victim of choosin' bad love, bad luck Lucy
Every man touched seems to be a doozy and plus
I'm attached to this looseleaf, stand on my two feet
So it's hard enough to even have to physically move me
Go ahead, try

[Hook: Jean Grae]
I know I'm on the right path
To who I'm gonna be at last
But don't rush me nigga (just try)
I know I'm wrong and right
At the same time, both—I'm the dark and light
And they say, "Life means everything to live"
At the same time, I got everything to give
Just don't rush me (hey, get your hand off me, man)
Don't rush me (you stupid?  I'll cut you)

[Verse 2: Jean Grae]
I gotta be more disciplined
I'm listenin' more to straight logic, blocking random shit that's drifting in
Age is a motherfucker (damn right)
Find myself staring at the little kids, thinking "I can beat 'em like a stepmother"
Creeping on a come-up at thirty soon
But looking twenty, ooh
The food catches up to you now plenty
Attending christenings of my best friend's children
And then asking who's next
And I'm wishing for six more wishes for Christmas or
Kids on the wish list
Or time machines to be in existence
I'm a team player—not (nope)
The dry wit is similar to Arizona weather.  Say it, nigga—"Hot"
Patent leather sole, tappin' at my bowl
If the album's not platinum, then I'll have to rack a gold
This rappin' ain't for nothin'
Unless I hold plaques so I can sit up on a boat like Colin, roll that
And you know that

[Hook: Jean Grae]
I know I'm on the right path
To who I'm gonna be at last
But don't rush me nigga
I know I'm wrong and right
At the same time, both—I'm the dark and light
And they say, "Life means everything to live"
At the same time, I got everything to give
Just don't rush me (hey, didn't I just tell you?)
Don't rush me (fall back, nigga)

[Verse 3: Jean Grae]
See, this here is the most serious that I've ever been
The most clear headed
My gear fetish clearly needs an account
So if I need, I'll smoke 'em all like Dennis Leary and I'm out
Beef's great though, thanks for addin' more insecurities
Just as I was findin' my level of maturity
Just as I was mindin' my business, tried to murder Jean's confidence
But lucky for me, you're all incompetent
Road block in this, yes
I see 'em tryna put a stop to my obnoxiousness but
I stay long-winded like sayin', "George Papadopoulous"
I know but I write from this heart with this
So, I've got some things to work on
My moodiness like masturbation—gets its jerk on
My fascination with the fast pace
The money's encapsulated in my mind space like "What a thrill"
Past dated and I know I'm not in last place
But it's hard to work through it with this masked face
And masking tape up on the window keeps the cold out
And every time I'm laying down, my back breaks because it's old now
I yell too much, get stressed too quick
But the best thing about it—I can change that shit
And still remain who I came down to Earth to be
It's not Jean Grae—that's just a name, you'll see

[Hook: Jean Grae]
I know I'm on the right path
To who I'm gonna be at last
But don't rush me nigga
I know I'm wrong and right
At the same time, both—I'm the dark and light
And they say, "Life means everything to live"
At the same time, I got everything to give
Just don't rush me
Don't rush me

[Outro: Jean Grae]
Please don't make me kill you, I don't want to
I don't need to go to jail right now
I got things to do
Can't be locked up, man
My momma, my momma
No momma.  No, no
Anyway, yo, thanks man
Thank you 9th
And we had a beautiful lunch
Don't be afraid to talk in the back
Thanks everybody for coming out tonight
Justus League!  What up Flames?
What up, though!
Flames, you're dope
You the man, Flames
{*laughs*} You the man
We out
