[Intro: Sample from The Hi-Jackers (1963)]
[?]: Hey, how am I supposed to see what you’ve been...  [?], what do you want?
[?]: I’m taking your train
[?]: Panel 123 to Command Center
[?]: Do you read me?  You ready to take down our orders to the [?] now?
[?]: I’m listening, you animal.  What do you want?
[?]: Do you have your pen?
[?]: Go on, for Pete’s sake
[?]: To begin with, it’s important that you understand three things: one, Panel 123 is completely within our control; two, we’re all armed with automatic weapons; three, we have no scruples whatsoever about killing.  Do you understand me so far?
[?]: Oh, I understand you fine, you lunatic.  You’ll never get away with this, you know?
[?]: Please inform the mayor that we demand one millions dollars cash to the release of the car and all the hostages [?]
[?]: That’ll be the day
[?]: The time is now 2:13 and the money must be in our hands not later than 3:13, one hour from now.  Now, if the money is not in our hands, we’ll kill one hostage for every minute [?]

[Hook: Block McCloud]
We want one million dollars or we’ll blow this train off these live tracks
Hip hop has been hijacked
We’ll kill one wack MC an hour ‘til our demands are met
Honest, this is not a threat.  It’s a promise
One million dollars or we’ll blow this train off these live tracks
Hip hop has been hijacked
We’ll kill one wack MC an hour ‘til our demands are met
Honest, this is not a threat.  It’s a promise

[Verse 1: Block McCloud]
I was poor before.  I don’t wanna be poor no more
So I bought a .44 from shorty at the corner store
This nigga Achmed, who’s a hothead, but got lead up in his pop’s shed
Shot dead a cop ‘cause the cop said he ain’t stopped on the red
I once bought a Gatorade and eight grenades, a magnum
A pack of gum.  Bought my girl, tampons and a handgun
The plan, son: take rap for ransom like the rich kid’s grandson
Making a phantom if they don’t pay the damn sum
Got bombs everywhere.  You best beware, be sure you check your floors
C4 on the second floor [towel rack and saw?]
Metaphors are gatting your body, make your organs explode
Torture your soul, stab you with a fork in the road
Get it on for fortune and gold.  One million dollars
Gives me corporate control and just enough to orbit the globe
I’m sick of being stuck in this roach-infested hellhole
So when the bell tolls at 12, I want to raise the death toll

[Hook: Block McCloud]
We want one million dollars or we’ll blow this train off these live tracks
Hip hop has been hijacked
We’ll kill one wack MC an hour ‘til our demands are met
Honest, this is not a threat.  It’s a promise
One million dollars or we’ll blow this train off these live tracks
Hip hop has been hijacked
We’ll kill one wack MC an hour...

[Verse 2: Block McCloud]
You took too long
I got no time to waste on the hook of this song
We could all go out, blow shit ‘til half of Brooklyn is gone
Catch you all.  Like Tribe said, you’ll have to “Push It Along”
I’ll step on the train and wait ‘til every person be on board
And once we in a tunnel, I go and pull the emergency cord
I’ll announce in my thick Spanish accent: Here’s a brief bulletin
Strapped with eight grenades, papo, I ain’t afraid to pull a pin
Asi que listen to my demands.  Mama, I’ll be specific
Even when I get one million dollars, what’s the difference
Si no pay?  [Pero, but?] why you did that?  Foolish men
Before I die, I’ll take this rapping puta’s head and put my bullets in
This hooligan’s sick of struggling, juggling jobs and bubbling
Hustling pimp [?] all the trouble I’m in

[Hook: Block McCloud]
So I want one million dollars or we’ll blow this train off these live tracks
Hip hop has been hijacked
We’ll kill one wack MC an hour ‘til our demands are met
Honest, this is not a threat.  It’s a promise
One million dollars or we’ll blow this train off these live tracks
Hip hop has been hijacked
We’ll kill one wack MC an hour ‘til our demands are met
Honest, this is not a threat.  It’s a promise

[Verse 3: Block McCloud]
Once I get my million dollars, I’ma take it and run
Hit the place where I’m from, Puerto Rico, bake in the sun
Find a Spanish hottie, mami chula, naked and young
Shaking her bun, taking my tongue, jiggle, making her cum
These motherfuckers ain’t made the deadline
Thought I was kidding.  Either way, I’m gonna see some Fed time
So I have no reservations and splattering hella brains
On this terror train, I want my money and my aeroplane
Well, somebody’s mommy’s gonna be “Singing the Blues” like Etta James
Bury your dead remains, feeling aches that Mary Jane cannot alleviate
Can’t deviate from my master plan
Should have gave me the record deal when y’all had the chance
