[Verse 1:]
You dyed my heart in a rainbow
Feelings and colors are the same
I never thought it was simple
The joy in just saying your name
(Love) in your orbit I'm your satellite
(Oh) Above the clouds, out of sight
I never thought I could feel this way
Unexpected just like how people say
(Love) Makes me want to sing this to the world
(Love) Makes me wanna

[Chorus:]
Love, homes in all types of shapes and shades and colors
You know how this feels, la la la…la
I know it kinda feels strange
You say that my heart skipped a beat, two beats
The moment you came my way, la la la…la

[Verse 2:]
I can admit I was cynical
But you can release believe that I was to blame
Years of learning to let It go
(Oh)  so I won't just live in the pain of love
Unexpected broke the paradigm, till I was yours
You are mine
I never thought I could feel this way
Unexpected just like how people say
I could give up, but don't
Maybe a little bit of bustling, hustling
Little scissors of hope
Never doubt, we just go
We get high, we get by, we get down low
We get bit, we get die, we get grown low
We get life, we get a little better together
We can hope, I get you, you get me, we get through
We get when everybody never wanted us to be the better two
I hope forever's really the infinite years we representing too
Cause now we been together since any place
We already know

[Chorus]

[Instrumental]

[Outro:] [x2]
Put your hands in the air
If you ever love to someone
Inhale, exhale if you ever love someone
(The moment you came)
