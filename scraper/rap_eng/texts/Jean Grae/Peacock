[Verse 1: Jean Grae]
They came first for me and I spoke up
With every line I spoke they just tightened the yoke up
No silver lining 'cept they're lining all their coke up
On the mirrors reflecting damn nothing on the close up
Subdividing the damn game, they suck you dry
Why you worried about your fame and the fucking vibe
Equating the while the tsunami of pains collide
Give them to the babies as an insane lullaby
I'm a proponent of the mainframe hack-in
If it wasn't built for me I'm laying the ax in
Break it apart and reconfigure the whole system
Take it to base level, demolition the building
You can see I ain't reined in, no puppets on me
Pressures what I feel like, what your souls deal like
Cause I'm so free
C'mon, c'mon
I know what it means to be a shutout
For choosing ironically never to live as a cutout
The use of technology equal to having a gun out
My open carry of self is offensive as a motherfucker
And I'm playing to raise the level of that shit
Cause without privilege you ponder the basics
Cause if you're the makeshift you never complacent
We ain't do nothin' but face this everyday shit
So tell meâ€”what's up?

[Verse 2: Quelle Chris]
They be pushing me to the point of pressure
In need of therapy with pressure points
I hit a joint to soar higher than a airliner
This wasn't 'bout the coal miners since the cold opens
Live from New York
The black alien space race, Malachi York
The smash grab, no hashtag riot for sport
The way they burned down Greenwood and Rosewood, Florida
They reserved the hood for you
To preserve the jail quota
Cause what's the law to the land owner
Where trespassing is the only way of passing and they shoot on sight
I hope the truest make it through the night
Control-delete Alt-Right
The harmony off key
I take the Colin Kaepernick knee
Like you ain't 'bout to off me
Cause I am free
An open book that you can quote without CliffsNotes
And you can judge it by the cover with the metal wrists and noose throats
I'm trying to delegate a new hope
Still trying to delegate a new hope
