[Verse 1: Jean Grae]
It's hard to say that we could never speak again
Or even just to keep it frequent, hard to keep it in
Harder to speak within the bars, limits of deep dissent
Of weepin' that 15 percent, of carin' where you keep your head
Of darin' to pretend things would be different if he just was dead
Fingers hover over keys with just nothing to right wrongs
Or write songs, so—I close the window on it
Took me until my 30s just to put my finger on it
Once you accept the knowledge, silence doesn't follow honest
Meet me back in '89
Where were babies still before the the new dawn of your mind
Before you went dormant
The pills, the kill switch, I wish they made one
Motherfucker, who still never changed from
Blamin' mom, blamin' us, for addiction, claimin' none
Prayin' five times a day was savin' us?
Fuck him, thank him for the jeans
Unfortunately—ain't enough
'Cause ain't a love fucked if it ain't love?
Thinkin' love hurts with them fist-words
And the discourse, fist first
It's passed over me, landed on y'all
Watch you landin' in walls
Couldn't do all I wanted, my mobility stunted
Y'all I would've killed him a million hundred times, no stallin' on it
Gasoline pourin' on it, that's Jean fallin' on it
Knife into his sternum and I'm turnin' on it
Burn it all, it's worth it all, he worth it all
Inverted comic collisions, watch the comicbook
Visions be fruitful, the dominant
Siblings be useful, watch our lives be truth filled
Do you still remember me and you still?

[Verse 2: Quelle Chris]
We've been through things, you've been through things
You Pepsi soda, you challenge, I've seen you die a thousand times
And been reborn, as something new
That yin and yin, that yang and yang
Extremes, shattered dreams
New wokes, we all folks that try to cope, ain't no joke, true
I disagree with some decisions that split the tree as we receive
As little seeds, we grown
You make your bed, I make my own
No stones tossed, cause I done crossed lines plenty times
Still you and you and I
Them small fries, my sister and OGs
Congrats, cause I fade out, then fade back
I coulda this, I shoulda that
Seen cul-de-sac's that call from time to time
Just mind your motives
And hold your mind, in case these words find you in favor from the other side
Sometimes we come out these cocoons as coons, not butterflies
That's cut and dry
The under-eyes got bags with tags from all the travel
We maintain, with no regrets, to proudly claim
The lost, the found amongst these mental planes
Everything's okay—or so they say
Everything's okay, and so they say
And so they say

[Outro]
Everything is fine — everything is fine
