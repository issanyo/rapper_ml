[Intro:]
I want you
I want you unless you want me baby

[Verse 1:]
Sorry bout your need
That don't look good
And I give you all that I can give
You know that together we could do this now
Ask you for [words unclear]

[Chorus:]
So letâ€™s get the talking, and get down to you and me
Let's slide

[Verse 2]
I need you, need you too
I need by you [?]
If you talk to me [?]
All the things they thought you don't see
You know that together we could do this now
Let's forever [?]

[Chorus]

[Outro:]
You know together we could
Let's slide
Oh, we can
You know together we could
Let's slide
