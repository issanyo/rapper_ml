[Verse 1]
I got lost caught up and I'm back with the force
And our plan still in force y'all better switch yours
Niggas lame like a door sample said Jean sampled Bread once
I can't front I need to get ahead
Not like hoes kneel to get ahead
I hustle deal till I break through for real
I'm punchy, your walls won't hold me, your boxes won't
Stop this rock on its way to obnoxious
I need to prosper while I preach the gospel
It's the truth and in the booth I'm impossible
On the stage, on the page it's hot so
Dance to it, like it's footloose white boy
Shake it with them crazy moves come on
I can't stand in your shoes
You ain't know, I planted the clues
Damage your crew, steady dismantling you
I panhandle this product if need be
And I'm smart enough to know the industry needs me
I've grown a lot for shows hot niggas don't sleep
The post address for toast without holding heat closely
Watch me run up in your posse
You get gas like the Nazis did
I catch flak like Roberta done dropped and shit
I'm loose lipped so I use it to abuse the music
Leave the track bruised up, all the tracks used up
With the headphones slapped and the volume crunk
So it blasts much better in the truck, oh what
I'm closer this year, New York shed a tear, give it up
What cha gonna do
When they try to take your shit from you

[Verse 2]
Been a cold winter, 'bout to be a hot summer
And you wondering where Jean is coming from, don't
I propose we worry about where we gonna go
Turn your stereo up, we're one step from spaghetti-o pants shredded
But we're better though
Not a lot of cheddar but now I gotta make the dough
Steady grind mind slipping into petty crime
Back me, I'm not in last have you paying out your ass
Put your game face wrapped in a cask'
The same place that I'm rapping from
Will snatch your tongue and bite it off and snap, you're done
I like drastic moves, nigga run your shoes
What cha gonna do

[Verse 3]
If I told you in one breath
That my mission is to be the best
Would you mind your business or be impressed
Brush it off, dismiss now that's a test
Are you being fo' real Jean?
Yes, the real dream is the field goal kick with the team, no less
And I'm not playing this just for kicks though
Slay this shit till I kicks and lay low
I say so, but some days I fell off
From this day on I'ma stay the course
Never again play soft, every rhyme is the playoffs
Every time must be memory line sprayed off
You will remember me
I am a contender contrary to what you get generally
I'll take time let it sink in now
You gotta free your mind to the thinking part
You gotta get the signs I'm freaking off
So much shit that my voice starts peaking off
Need this music as much as you
I'm a fan goddamn it and I love it too, so
Wave your hands like the sandman's coming through
But all cheers man, we don't want the boos
In fact fuck that, get up and clap your paws together
Make noise like we wet up the floor, better
Wake up y'all like a Spike Lee flick, good morning boys
I'm the type you leave with, I'm on it

[Verse 4]
Yeah man, what cha gonna do when the skies starts falling
I be out on the corner "yes y'all"in
To the blockades and buildings smack pavement
And onlookers gaze in amazement it's hypnotism
Just hitting the rhythm I fuck songs
All up in the bars like prisons are up yours
Like 7 and Grae got infinite new ways
Every minute to infiltrate strong on, eat your spinach
The confidence won't be diminished
Go longer from start to finish now
You spark the inner child
Is dark with an innocent smile
Park your whips like splits listen in for a while, c'mon
What cha gonna do
