[verse 1]
What about love?
And how about timing?
And the thoughts we shared
And the walls were built
And then you blocked me

[Chorus]
What about us?
What about love?
What about time and sharing
Grace and family. Oh, so precious
What about love? What about love?

[verse 2]
What about grace
How about forgiveness?
The time was lost and so were thoughts
I guess youâ€™re not as ambitious

[Chorus]
What about us?
What about love?
What about time and sharing
Grace and family. Oh, so precious
What about love? What about love?

[bridge]
Oh, what about love?
You gonna give it all up?
Oh, what about-what about-what about love?!

[Chorus]
What about us?
What about love?
What about time and sharing
Grace and family. Oh, so precious
What about love? What about love?
