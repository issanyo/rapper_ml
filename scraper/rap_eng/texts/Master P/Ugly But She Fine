[Intro]
Gates winning for president
You all bitch ass niggas already know what I'm hitting for
You know what it is with me man
You already know I go dumb
You know a whole lot of, yeah, you know

[Hook]
She ugly but she fine (x3)
And I fuck her like she mine
Fuck your girl, she a poo poo bitch
You oughta let a nigga run a choo choo with
She pretty with no ass (x3)
And this nigga think she bad
She pretty with no ass (x3)
Sucka nigga think she bad

[Verse 1: Master P]
Me and Kevin Gates, we was flipping them off
While that nigga talking shit, he was drinking it all
Until a shawty let it shake, let it pop
Now a nigga back to the motherfucking spot
Make that ass twerk like you trying to get cash
ATF come, then you better run fast
Shawty from the ghetto, but damn she bad
Call her Meagan Good, she the best I ever had
So drop it for a real nigga back on the floor
Then she on the hood, on the motherfucking Porsche
Niggas go hard in the motherfucking store
Shawty got to come back, make me want more
Now she's ?
Find me in the projects pushing them things
Knowing I'm a real nigga, so she keep it real
Knowing I'm a trill nigga, so she keep it trill
She a bad bitch

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Kevin Gates]
Imm'a give you this dance, it's not what hit
That beat came on, she rode that dick
Popping on a handstand, and did a split
Katey Red came on and she wop wiggy wiggy
Free throws, freak hoes, knees touching elbows
Lot of bands in my pants, fresh Adidas shell toes
Round the clock (keep getting it), whole block came with it
Get on top she with it, told her drop, she did it
Thighs hypnotize and I'm thinking she's a keeper
Bitch at home booje, I think I might leave her
She gon' make her booty clap clap to the beat
Ugly but she fine, and I think you might agree (Get em Gates!)
Bitch, fine ass girl, making songs about you
Ass cheeks so big, got your thong surrounded
Ass is so fat can't get my arms around it
If you pretty with no ass, get your ass from round me

[Hook]
