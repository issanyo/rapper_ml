[Master P]
Five kids in the house with no food to eat
So me and my brother we took to the dope streets
See that's how the whole game started
And if a sucker talk shit, I had to get retarded
Paranoid as fuck so my life changed
Went to school, kid, now I'm selling cocaine
I'm like a Porshe moving fast in the dope game
I started a living now I'm supplying no stains
In other words I'm a kingpin
But in this game, you see, it makes no sense
Just the other day my brother got shot
I'm at his funeral on his casket dropping rocks
Sister crying and mom's going crazy
My uncle Marvin and advice could even phase me
I'm on a mission, I got a job to complete
They take one of mine, I put six of theirs into sleep
So I live by the gat and that's my toy
And out on the streets, I'm mama's bad boy

[Chorus]
Diamond in the back, sunroof top
Digging in the scene with the gangsta lean
Mama's bad boy
Diamond in the back, sunroof top
Digging in the scene with the gangsta lean
Mama's bad boy

[Master P]
But I live with the juveniles, grew up in the ghetto
Back in the Calliope projects I couldn't see in the meadows
At the time I was tripping, cause we were struggling every day
Took to the streets and did a lick and got quick paid
I lived like a trine but now lost like a gine
I'm saying fuck the police cause I'm police defined
Don't give a fuck about nothing, but my meal and my family
I took to my ?? because my mom couldn't handle me
I'm crazy as fuck, you better duck when my nine's out
Be dreading my life, you lose yours, that's how you find out
That I'm a real motherfucker, sucker test me
I pull's a nine, its one life less see
I'm jacking and stealing and killing and peeling
Caps with Tec's, and 9's and Uzi's, yea, that's how I'm feeling
Shiesty friends of mine that's tripping every day
They wonder why, why the P put some heads away
In other words I live by the gat and that's my toy
And out on the streets, I'm mama's bad boy

[Chorus]
Diamond in the back, sunroof top
Digging in the scene with the gangsta lean
Mama's bad boy
Diamond in the back, sunroof top
Digging in the scene with the gangsta lean
Mama's bad boy

[Outro]
Mama's bad boy
Its so hard on the streets
Sometimes it hard being me, yea
But you make it something
Just think about the consequences
You make it something
It ain't so easy being me, you know I'm saying
Sometimes there's a lot of people on the street who can't make it
You know what I'm saying, we can do this
I'm doing this for a good cause

[Chorus]
Diamond in the back, sunroof top
Digging in the scene with the gangsta lean
Mama's bad boy
Diamond in the back, sunroof top
Digging in the scene with the gangsta lean
Mama's bad boy
