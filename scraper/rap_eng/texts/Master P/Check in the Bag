[Chorus]
Went from no papers
To doing numbers
Had to climb ladders
Just to count hundreds
Nigga check in the bag
Nigga check in the bag
Nigga check in the bag
Went from no papers
To doing numbers
Had to climb ladders
Just to count hundreds
Nigga check in the bag
Nigga check in the bag
Nigga check in the bag

[Verse 1]
I’m in the trap with a hundred niggas
I got the paper in front of niggas
I don’t want to fuck with you bummy niggas
I don’t want to fuck with you bummy niggas
I get the paper and nah nah nah
Running through fifty like ah ah ah
Come [?]
Come to the crib I got two gates
I got the rave on me
That’s what they hate on me
That bitch don’t come with no top on it
I got the rock and gwop homie
I got the money in the bag
I got her shakin her house
I just flex for a check
I got the pug on deck

[Chorus]
Went from no papers
To doing numbers
Had to climb ladders
Just to count hundreds
Nigga check in the bag
Nigga check in the bag
Nigga check in the bag
Went from no papers
To doing numbers
Had to climb ladders
Just to count hundreds
Nigga check in the bag
Nigga check in the bag
Nigga check in the bag
Went from no papers
To doing numbers
Had to climb ladders
Just to count hundreds
Nigga check in the bag
Nigga check in the bag
Nigga check in the bag
Went from no papers
To doing numbers
Had to climb ladders
Just to count hundreds
Nigga check in the bag
Nigga check in the bag
Nigga check in the bag

[Verse 2]
Runnin lapse for the cash
Rottweiler by my stash
I rap and it sound like a missile nigga
I know you don’t your issue nigga
Add the shit like calculus
Got the baddest bitch she immaculate
At Alchemist she threw her panties
On the balcony
I see my mama go an get a bag
She told me son stay up on they ass
Never lackin', I’m the one that they feel
One nigga in the front and two in the rear
The illest that’s here - act like you know it
We got artillery but never show it
The ghetto poet forever flowin'
Rendered a [?] I’m stacking my fortune

[Chorus]
Went from no papers
To doing numbers
Had to climb ladders
Just to count hundreds
Nigga check in the bag
Nigga check in the bag
Nigga check in the bag
Went from no papers
To doing numbers
Had to climb ladders
Just to count hundreds
Nigga check in the bag
Nigga check in the bag
Nigga check in the bag
Went from no papers
To doing numbers
Had to climb ladders
Just to count hundreds
Nigga check in the bag
Nigga check in the bag
Nigga check in the bag
Went from no papers
To doing numbers
Had to climb ladders
Just to count hundreds
Nigga check in the bag
Nigga check in the bag
Nigga check in the bag
