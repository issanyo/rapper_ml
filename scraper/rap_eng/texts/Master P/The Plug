[Verse 1:]
Last chance, there’s no limit forever
When you’re girl smoking what y’all smoking
Y’all come over here holla
Come over here and sip on some of this champagne
Lucky baller, you’re a genius
I see you in the club
Looking all beautiful little love and I’m just saying
If you’re man tripping at night, get with me
I ain’t looking for no stress
I ain’t trying to give you no problems
I hope you feel the same way
She looking for love
If you’re looking for love
I feel like, you know
Even a street n*gga need a little love sometimes

[Chorus:]
She looking for love, I’m looking for plug
She wanna fuck me, I wanna fuck her
I’m in the club every night
Popping bottles living the life
Sheila, I do this shit every night

[Verse 2:]
My hood n*ggas, baby
Shit that’s what happened, a couple hoes
You know I respect this shit
I open the doors
I won’t miss Louisiana, then I’m going to Alabama
I might go to Texas, got my girl in Atlanta
Shit, we good baby
Mix it up with your n*gga
And if you’re best friend Bobby call my girl in Virginia
I ain’t Ludacris but I’m down with the bros
I’m from the boo, got bitches in different area codes

[Chorus] [x2]

[Verse 3:]
I miss them long nights we had
Too perfect under them covers
I kiss ya, I hug ya, I squeeze ya, I fuck ya
I miss ya hands, had the perfect hands
I remember how you [?] different places
I text you what you doing
You said you went and left
So the first photograph
I said you’re killing me softly
I can’t love you but I can
She text boohoo
Cool off

[Chorus] [x2]

[Verse 4:]
The bitch doing dumb shit, that dumb shit
That going to get a n*gga hung quick
I keep a trail with my plush
Show a n*gga love
I dare any one of these pussies out there to fuck that up
Ain’t got no time for a plan
I’m trying to stack this pain pill
Please tell me to watch out for those damn hoes and the perpetrators
This bitch brought it for a n*gga
Like I dropped something
I told her bring me to the plug
I’m trying to cop something

[Chorus] [x2]
