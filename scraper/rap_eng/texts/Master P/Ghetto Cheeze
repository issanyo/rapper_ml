Sendin fiends to da moon, me and Silkk just ghetto hustlin

Ya'll oughta know, ya'll must be off some dumb shit
Cuz me and P run this, 12:00 count up hundreds
In a clock crack house, nigga, back out the back route
I stacks trip til I trip, pop the clip when I smash out

Puttin in work for some pamper money
Sellin fiends them gummies, mouths full of fifties and hundreds
But ain't stoppin til I fall on my knees
And be up the next day wit ghetto cheeze
Servin fiends dem double-ups and bubble ups
And meet me at the front of the block, nigga to get some bubble up

Verse 2: (Silkk Da Shocker)

I flip D like a light switch

You ain't got my money I might go, Everybody go tonight bitch
I gotta be cold like a snake cuz nigga these days I playa hate
But I keeps that nine by my waistline
Everybody quick to dump a million like pimp me from the bassline
Fuck I ain't askin fo shit

And have OZs like the wizard
Cut keys like some scissors
Cold like a blizzard
Slimy like a lizard
Cause fuck it, Ima dump em

But I be dumpin, nigga, frontin fo my yayo

Verse 3: (Master P)

Takin penitentary chances but fuck the warden
"Nigga, yo son need a new pair of Jordans"
You see the shit a hustler go through
" Oh yeah, pick me up a DKNY purse boo"
The ghetto pharmacist I'm on the grind
Open like 7-11, 24-7 Times
Makin Scrilla, Scratch, tack, and paper
36 OZs into 1 key fo paper
"Would you kill for me"
If that was my dope they took from you
"Now would you steal for me"
If a nigga try to steal from you

We be da Bonnie and Clyde done came up togetha
You be draped in gold, I be ridin a Roles
You be in a BMW, That's how we roll
Side by side, Hoo-ride
Down fo whateva, Did it from the south side

Tryin to get some ghetto cheeze, Fuck minimum wage
Everyday, all day hustlin to get paid
Tryin to get some ghetto cheeze, Fuck minimum wage
