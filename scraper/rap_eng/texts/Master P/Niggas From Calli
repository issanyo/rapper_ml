Yeah bitches
We got the motherfuckin niggas from cali, ya know what I'm sayin?
E-a-ski, rally ral and master p
But yo ski
Kick it like this g

[e-a-ski]
A nigga don't get no respect
Unless a motherfucker gotta come and snap some necks
So I play that game like it 'posed to be played
Cause ski and cmt is not the one that's gonna daze
Yeah I see niggas jockin niggas like a bitch
Just cause the punk made one local hit
Even my homies get brainwashed by that shit
The look at me and say, man ski is doin it
Fuck all that, I ain't givin up props
Until I hear the motherfuckin nigga album drop
So I get pissed and take it out on wax
And think how the fuck they sign this one dimensional artist to a damn
Contract
But life moves on, huh
And while it's movin I write about it in my fuckin songs
I pack a nine double l just incase
I talk shit and they wanna front me to my face
Punk niggas wanna get respect
But disrespect, but it don't even work like that
It's all about the mighty dollar
Whoever controls the dead presidents control the power
So watch your back in this game see
Cause niggas get lame see, but they can't fuck with me
I might be humble but I'm only givin [?]
So motherfuckers can't jack a nigga from cali

[cmt]
Yeah bitches just like that, ya know what I'm sayin?
But yo, another nigga from cali
His name is rally ral
So yo ral
School these motherfuckers

[rally ral]
When will motherfuckers learn, fuckin around with me you get burned
It's all a battle brother, comin up on it firm
Nine one was the year for school
And nine two's for rules
And nine three's for rulin
Huh, any motherfucker out there
You keep fuckin around I have you rappin in a wheelchair
Cause rally ral don't play no way
I'd rather slay a motherfucker like all day
So I'm a rock it on till the end then
It's a neccessity for me to keep lendin
Funky tracks for the wack to improve on
Listen to the nigga rally or move on
Because I got rhymes for the young and old
I got a style for the middle class and low
Whoever said that rally ral couldn't deliver
I have your fuckin ass goin up a river
Just like a boat goin mainstream
I have your fuckin body doin the same thing
So now you know not to fuck around with rally
A nigga-nigga-nigga-nigga-nigga from cali
