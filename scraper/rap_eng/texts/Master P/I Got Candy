This for all ya'll niggas dat TRU to the g-zame
From Master P and the whole TRU click. It's time to hook ya ice
Cream up and turn it into candy
Mo B. Dick: Oh!

Chorus I: I got candy!
Mo B. Dick: I can serve you on the block
Cocaine, cream, or rock, it takes over fiends
I got candy!
Mo B. Dick: I wanna know
If you feel it, too, just like I do

[Silkk]
I hit the block non stop, rocks in my sock
Pause for a second when I see the cops
Rocks or candy, whatever you wanna call it
But when I get you hooked, it's like a muthafuckin alcoholic
I stay posted around like a poster, watch fiends follow like a toaster
Candy I have move em fast like a roller coaster
Knick knack paddy whack, give a fiend a fast sack
9 times outta 10, he'll tell his friends and they'll be right back
Whole bunch a niggas, and just one fiend
They come to me for less cut, cause I boast bigger cream
And them fiends come back cause they understand me
I open up shop, open up shop cause I got candy

Chorus II: He's got candy! Yo eyes roll in your head
Mo B. Dick: You toss and turn in yo bed
Cause I only sell the best to you
Mo B. Dick: Indeed I do!
Simply put I'm the reason why
Silkk: Why?
Everyday you get high
Mo B. Dick: Real high!
And you know I got that crack for you
Mo B. Dick: Indeed I do!
Just for you

[Silkk]
I'm sittin' on the post, choppin' game with this bitch
I see ya later ho, I got's money to get
Cause as long as a fiend with dream, I got cream
Money moves everything around me, kn'what I mean?
Cause another day another dolla, I'm sittin' on a drop Impala
On some gold thangs, watch all them hoes follow
My money makes stacks and real deals
I keep my cash, nigga taj, I can't chill, I got's to pay bills
And these niggas can't stand me
Got this ho that said she wanna suck my dick for candy
Gotta watch out for these dope fiends cause they be runnin' tricks
$3 what they gon come with, $3 what they gon get
I hold the block like a 7-11(7-11), kick yo door in like taj (taj)
Cut the shit up like machette, chop the shit up like grass
Cause I'm a stay hustlin till they fuckin' can me bitch
Because it's Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, I got
Candy

Chorus I

[Master P]
Uuuugggghhhh! I smoke weed cause I'm a drug dealer
I sell candy on the block fool, to make my fuckin scrilla
7 grams for $2.50
Got niggas in the hood on hold, tryin to get with me
I keep a stash for the drought
But the shit I sling daily in plastic out my mouth
My homies use code names
Like L.D., Big Champ, Slim, T Dove, and Big Mann
I take penitentiary chances to make a livin'
Every 1st of the month, is like Thanksgiving
Fiends hug me like they miss me
Hoes see me rollin' in my car, and wanna be with me
I get my candy from California by the keys
Ship it in boats and trains back to New Orleans
And open up shop like Mr. Rogers
But sell mo hits than the Dodgers
And fiends holla "ugh!" cause it's all good
From the triple beam, straight to the neighborhood
And when you sellin' candy trust nobody
Cause niggas even snitched on John Gotti
Niggas stay TRU to the g-zame
Never front on muthafuckin' candy in the dope game
And never go to the fedz on ya folks
Cause punks get fucked with the soap

Chorus III:
Mo B. Dick: I got that real good cocaine (cocaine) each and every day
A real TRU soldier, on these streets I gotta get my pay
My game so tight, So good, so good, yeah!
Mo B. Dick: Cocaine, heroin, that fire ass weed
Valiums and boulders, just tell me what you need baby. Oh!
Sweet like candy, candy!
