[Master P]
I like a bad chick like, Martha Stewart that go to jail
And holdin these streets down, Lisa Raye be a entertainer
And still got a ghetto pass, Oprah Winfrey, Pimp TV
And Paris Hilton get paid to play, that's how I like it

[Chorus: Master P]
I like a thug chick, I want a bad bitch {*repeat 8X*}

[Master P]
Give me a, country girl with tits like Ali {*wolf whistle*}
Ghetto as fuck with a face like Halle
In the club she likes to get rowdy
And only fuck with thugs cause you know she 'bout it
I like 'em black, Puerto Rican, white, Haitian
Asian, Columbian, latino, Jamaican
Attitude like Wendy Williams, a ride or die chick
Thug girls in the club raise 'em up high miss
Pussy pop for me, make it drop for me
Be a lady on the block but keep it hot for me
Go to school, go to work, talk proper
Problems in the hood man shorty got the chopper
Get your nails done, get your hair fixed
Play it how it go, fuck it, ice up your wrists
Be a thug chick, keep it real miss
Tattoos, custom golds, you a boss bitch

[Chorus]

[Halleluyah]
Look - mami in the club and she shakin like she workin
Look - mami movin right, man I'm likin how she twerkin
Man she do it all night, like she ride with a purpose
And like Juvenile said, I need some mouth lip service - heyy
Baby said she smokin, started lightin up the purple
I ain't lyin, she a dime, from a hood where they merk you
I said, fuck it man, I'ma take my chances
She look good in that shirt, and them respect pants-es yeah
Mami by the bar, every nigga wanna holla
Buyin drinks, writin phone numbers a hundred dollars
I'ma tell you like this, I ain't gotta do shit
Cause she catch cold chills when she glance at the wrist - heyy
Mami got the Louis with the Prada on her hip
And them six inch heels got her flossin so sick
And them Christian Dior's lookin good on her frame
I like how you move, keep doin yo' thang

[Chorus]

[Master P - fading out]
Do that dance {*repeat 4X*}
Hey mahhhh, heyyyyy, okay!
Do that dance {*repeat 4X*}
Hey mahhhh, heyyyyy, okay!
