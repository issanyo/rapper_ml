[Intro]
Marqus Clae
The ghetto poet
All y'all hoes movin' too fast, y'all need to slow it down
Baby, can you slow it down, baby, please

[Chorus]
Baby, slow down
You can move it like a Porsche on a highway
Baby, slow down
You movin' too fast, you movin' too fast, whoa
Baby, slow down
Too fast, too fast
Baby, slow down
Too fast, too fast
Baby, slow down
Too fast, too fast
Baby, slow down
You can move it like a Porsche on a highway, yay, yay

[Verse 1]
You need to slow it, you movin' like locomotives
I think you had too much potion, you makin' it hard to focus
She say I'm the dopest but that's what I was molded to be
I got these bitches breaking they necks to get closest to me
But see, all that was before college
I make the horse holler, on that plane floor us with four pilots
The way she killin' me, I think I'ma need four doctors
Stroke so willingly, leave her shaking, she so naughty

[Chorus]
Baby, slow down (baby, slow down)
You can move it like a Porsche on a highway
Baby, slow down
You movin' too fast, you movin' too fast, whoa
Baby, slow down
Too fast, too fast
Baby, slow down
Too fast, too fast
Baby, slow down
Too fast, too fast
Baby, slow down
You can move it like a Porsche on a highway, yay, yay

[Verse 2]
I been starting out the stars of the Panamera
The windows tinted, shawty lookin' temptin', it's whatever
Don't make me pull in on side of the road and hit the hazard
Hit you with that boa you bendin', watchu telling me, you have to
But listen, baby, slow down
You drivin' too fast, in this Porsche on the sideway
Baby, slow down
We movin' too fast, we movin' units on this highway

[Chorus]
Baby, slow down (baby, slow down)
You can move it like a Porsche on a highway
Baby, slow down
You movin' too fast, you movin' too fast, whoa
Baby, slow down
Too fast, too fast
Baby, slow down
Too fast, too fast
Baby, slow down
Too fast, too fast
Baby, slow down
You can move it like a Porsche on a highway, yay, yay

[Verse 3]
She shake that ass like a popper
I'ma take her to the house, break her own proper
Man, she robbin' like a Porsche on a motherfucking highway
She like it from the back so I'ma do it sideways
She twerkin' on me like she twerkin' in the club
Shawty goin' fast, she in love with the thugs
So I give you whatchu want, slow motion for me
Turn around and back it up, baby, slow motion for me

[Chorus]
Baby, slow down (baby, slow down)
You can move it like a Porsche on a highway
Baby, slow down
You movin' too fast, you movin' too fast, whoa
Baby, slow down
Too fast, too fast
Baby, slow down
Too fast, too fast
Baby, slow down
Too fast, too fast
Baby, slow down
You can move it like a Porsche on a highway, yay, yay

[Outro]
That's living forever
Marqus Clae, Ace B, Master P
Mo Roy, Tank Game nigga, gang gang, nigga
You a genius, you kidding me
Ayy, ayy
