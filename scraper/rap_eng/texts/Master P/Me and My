[Intro]
It’s No Limit forver
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Uh

[Verse 1]
Told them the king need the jewel
And my eyes look like a mug
From the looking at them dead presence
To be shot down in the Holy Ghost
Rich niggas do the most
Money Mafia yeah we toast
To the good life
And make em act right
Texture, multi clip, cock it back, let it rip
Say so I’m always counting my blessings
I do the time for my niggas
When at them all I say goodbye for my niggas
Say fuck them others bitch ride for my niggas (rah)

[Hook]
Some say life ain’t sure
I think we was cursed from the start
I’m always tryna play my part
I don’t wanna wish that on
Me and my niggas (me and my)
Me and my niggas (me and my)
Me and my niggas (me and my)
Me and my niggas (me and my)
I don’t wanna wish that on
Me and my niggas

[Verse 2]
If I pull it out I’m bucking today
Free my niggas locked up in the pen
So many niggas snitchin, riding on the block
Got me paranoid, sleeping with a Glock
I heard they wanna kill my nigga
Man shit done got real my nigga
I ain’t gotta get low in the ride until
My real nigga start to hit the gas and drive
Look, look you done fucked up
I heard you want me dead
I heard you put a couple stacks above my fucking head
But I’m a killer so I know how to bled
You looking for me, I’m looking for you, [?]
I’m coming to get you, I’m coming to bust your fucking head
Boy I’m retarded, I’m a die behind my bread
You play with me and I’m a fill your ass with lead
Off, off, off with your head

[Hook]
Some say life ain’t sure
I think we was cursed from the start
I’m always tryna play my part
I don’t wanna wish that on
Me and my niggas (me and my)
Me and my niggas (me and my)
Me and my niggas (me and my)
Me and my niggas (me and my)
I don’t wanna wish that on
Me and my niggas

[Verse 3]
Shawty say she bad up on a nigga
So I keep the bible close and drive with a pistol
Holding for the piece to give em
Only worry bout intention
I do the devil work but overall I am a Christian
Amen, they say the bread is 45
The mind is for the blood
And [?] for the man I was in the gun
I heard your mama in a semi vest speaking tongues
And every Sunday I’m in church, never would’ve gone
Yeah I started with a block, now I run the city
Sipping [?] the binges mad with with the Bentley
I can call it I don’t trust em
PCVV like fuck em
Plotting the MI saga, always hating and plug equip
Blogging about the mafia, you’re equal to nothing
See I’m living for everything but I’m dying for nothing
I’m from the hood, aye, letting things swallow crack pipes
40 caps to the clips, that’s that act right
Bang, bang, bang

[Hook]
Some say life ain’t sure
I think we was cursed from the start
I’m always tryna play my part
I don’t wanna wish that on
Me and my niggas (me and my)
Me and my niggas (me and my)
Me and my niggas (me and my)
Me and my niggas (me and my)
I don’t wanna wish that on
Me and my niggas

[Verse 4]
I heard they hit the witness and the DA
They wish that I was deceased but life is too short
I walk the streets with the heat
Because the fuck boys watching, then G eaters ratting
The players hate snitching, don’ pounce dick grabbing
You clapping with the mackin’
So distract em don’t [?]
If I have to by enemies necessary
Send the [?] too our bellas
[?]
You niggas are scary, like virgin Lucy
[?]
Shining like crystal in my waist
Shadow pumping the back
But we’re setting off in his face
These [?] next
Stopping the expedition, money she was made to speak
Then up the weed, drop my ticks and won’t admit
Checking up on my schedule for all the beans I spent
Get a hustlin’ broad, be the world of the sidekick
Carrying enough to catch life and I’m for my packs, let’s go

[Hook]
Some say life ain’t sure
I think we was cursed from the start
I’m always tryna play my part
I don’t wanna wish that on
Me and my niggas (me and my)
Me and my niggas (me and my)
Me and my niggas (me and my)
Me and my niggas (me and my)
I don’t wanna wish that on
Me and my niggas

[Verse 5]
(Uh-uh)
Writing in my Death Note, I’m on my tenth list
Rid the world of all the evil and the negligence
Somethin’ like a pessimist, I suggest you don’t walk
Unless you know what you stepping in
Fame is disease, money is the medicine
But we the mafia, end the world of tilapia
Some niggas try stopping us but they choppas adopted us
Click - clack - tick - tack tell a nigga time’s up
Welcome to the zone where all haters fall hateful
Fuck around and get your fucking skull cracked faithfully
Niggas out here hating, trespassing on my vacancy
They bomb the whole terrorists and bomb your whole agency
Blacks on the move for the win not to lose
Nigga tryna clip me when I’m wobbling in my shoes
Clap back banana squeeze finger on the trigger
Why they wanna wish that on me and my nigga
(Nigga, nigga)
