[MP] Slim Thug you ready?
[ST] Geyeah!
[MP] I'm on my way from New Orleans, and I'm comin to Texas
[MP] And we gon' handle this, ya heard?
[ST] Slim Thugga
[MP] Ghetto Bill!

[Chorus 4X: Master P]
Lay it down, lay it down
Tear this motherfucker UP, shut it down

[Master P]
Security couldn't stop us, go see the doctor
Nigga wanna fight I got a motherfuckin chopper
I'm in the back gettin blunted with thugs
Whole city walk through, they give me kisses and hugs
I'm a real motherfucker, I ain't takin no shit
I got golds in my mouth, and ice on my wrist
Homies see me in the club and they tryin to hate
I'm poppin bottles in the club cause I'm hard as a 8
Suckers try to mean mug but they ain't bustin a grape
Get my money from the block flippin quarters and eighths
I'm a No Limit Soldier, motherfucker you heard me
Uptown, Calliope, projects to dirty
65 for birdies, call me you thirsty
I'm a legend in the hood like the boy James Worthy
You ain't a soldier motherfucker keep steppin
Turn a, 211 to a 187 - yeah

[Chorus]

[Slim Thug]
Slim Thuggahhhh
Boys gotta lay it down when the boss come around
Or the Glock fo' pound gon' knock 'em on the ground
Geyeah - you can vouch in my town I'm a motherfuckin G
And I got a lotta soldiers on my team like P
I get word that them haters tryna catch a nigga slippin - what?
Run your ass up and you gon' catch a ass-whippin
I'm flippin through my hood on Vogues, still tippin
Glock cocked with the clip in, hell naw I ain't trippin
I'm a Boss Hogg Outlaw, chasin my bread
Snitch niggas out here tellin got me shakin the feds
I'm in the club pullin hoes, fuck datin instead
I got a supermodel at the crib waitin in bed
Got the blocks on lock, you gotta come see the boss
If you wanna get the work for the dirt cheap cost
Me and Master P represent the bottom of the South
And if nigga hate that, he'll lose the bottom of his mouth, geyeah

[Chorus]

[Master P]
BLACK SOPRANOS!!
