Niggas bow down respect this killa

Fuck yo life

Got a block from people 7
Sold it 12 mo'

Got my money and my ice fucked his wife
Made ha' thick pork chops,peas,and rice
Southern dealergittin' his hustle every night
Nigga pass tha dice

So hit yo knees trick
(4x repeat)
(chorus)
{Master P}
Hustlin' day & night
Thats my life
Candy painted on them gold thangs from tha rap game to tha dope game

{Mystikal}
As long back as I can remember
When I was comin' up I was tryin' to git somethin'
Felt like I didn't have nothin
(I had to)put in tha effort
And tightin' up on my hustle
Since spendin tha on
Utilities and a mind musta
Fish and chicken plate,macaroni cheez,green beanz
5 dollar supper
Fuck workin menimum wadge
Cause my feet hurtin' I'm musty
Cause tha first time somethin' come up missin' bitch
Start watchin'like I don't trust ya
And as hard as I used to work
Find that shit
Then i'm really fucked up
Next thang you know
I'm assed out unemployed but I didn't do nothin'
Try ya best to invest in my name but I keep strutin'
My financial situations gone be alrightjust gimme my check
Bitch I ain't stuttin ya
What ever got to do to keep focus keep from sufferin'
These niggas don't understand
I write my tightest shit when times is tuff
Sick & tired of dreamin' bout' blowin' up
Chances of makin' it glowin' up
Seem like it ain't gone happen to me either
Rate i'm goin' slow as fuck
But never no worry
Wit every reward theres a struggle
And every muthafuckin' come up theres a hustle
(4x repeat)
(chorus)

{Master p}
(ugh)
Rip tha game and got em' tossed up
Hundred G's two keys wit tha birder then we bought up
How many niggas holla solja runnin from tha rollas
Gone on that dolja hatas yall can't hold
Niggas off tha tank clockin' bank
So we jump off in them thangs
Got tha cane murda in tha dope game
Rappers gittin' killed
Niggas guard yo grill
I'm from tha 3rd ward
So otha niggas better feel
Tha silence of tha land
Niggas green & and ham
I be bussin' muthafuckas like cuttin' up eggs and ham
Down south niggas ball
In a city like New Orleans
Specilfied  for murda
Thats why they call
Mystikal,and Serv-On
Nigga Master P
Yall want a key
Nigga hit me on tha beep
Non for free
It's gone for 18 5
But when you hit us niggas
Check because we runnin' from tha southside
Heard
