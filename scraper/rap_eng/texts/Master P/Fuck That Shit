Back to the muthafuckin locs, niggas wanna joke
But it's time to sell, let's go
Niggas talking bout the rich ain't hard as dope
But they better back off because we came up
Now I'm back in the hood with the whole
Sceam selling dope to the muthafuckin dope fiends
3 keys and the nigga came up
Too many fiends to keep this muthafuckin game up
Now I'm rapping, niggas say I win for jyp, sike!

Fuck that shit
From the city where we never sell out bitch
Fuck that shit
From the city where we never sell out bitch
Fuck that shit. From the city where we never sell out bitch
Fuck that shit

Life
Life in the muthafuckin game
You know you have to live in the
South to get a muthafuckin name
Wanna be me, wanna be you
But they ain't down with a fuckin clue
Talkin that shit for centuries
[?] that ho never been to penitentery
Niggas I hit, niggas talking shit
But a nigga that don't quit
Can't hook the muthafuckin beata
I pack a fuckin 9 for the suckas that wanna greed us
I'm a nigga on a role to get paid, bitch

Fuck that shit
From the city where we never sell out bitch
Fuck that shit
From the city where we never sell out bitch
Fuck that shit

Back to the muthafuckin fiend
Back on another niggas dream
Niggas gettin paid by the grouse
And every fuckin body in the hood gotta sell dope
Because the white man gotta fucking see us sold out
The ghetto code living and then it blows up
Niggas getting jacked for their jewels
Read bout another nigga on the fuckin news
Niggas go trippin, niggas in there dippin
But a gold P ain't snippin
Niggas out whatchin his fuckin back
Niggas get stuck like that. Fuck that shit
Fuck that shit. Give a nigga a fuckin deal on a job
Give a nigga the gatt code and teach him how to ride
Because the way I felt won't pay a nigga rent, he still can't
You said it makes no sense to take a brotha
To jail for his reputation, when the government is
Drived by the flation
A brotha gettin beat by the police
One black judge and you think this shit is sease
I'm sell caine to get my grits, because I can't get a job so...

Fuck that shit
From the city where we never sell out bitch
Fuck that shit
From the city where we never sell out bitch
Fuck that shit
From the city where we never sell out bitch
Fuck that shit
From the city where we never sell out bitch
