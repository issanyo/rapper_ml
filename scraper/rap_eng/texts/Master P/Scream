Look in the mirror we gone scream holla records (murder man)
That's my homies that be screaming in the grave yards
Ughhhhhhhh Scream its wicked out here

[Master P]
Holla bloody Mary lookin' eyes of the demon
When you see a nigga like me, keep screamin'!
I smoke green with the reaper
I'm from the ghetto got paid with the gat and the beeper
Just a young nigga tryin' make it
Visualize me in the ghetto and these bitches tryna break me
Forgive me for my weed and my Hennessy
Young niggas when I'm gone won't remember me
Weed and bitches be my past time
Live the life of a hustler came up on ghetto ryhmes
Seven-teen rounds for the bustas
Keep two for the cluckas
I got .45, nines, and gats cocked
Young homies bangin' corner signs on my block
And the average age is twenty-five
Young homies don't even live to retire
I get paid, I pluck hoes
Slang ki's, I got the triple gold

[Hook]
Scream (Aghhhhhh) I hear them comin'
Scream (Aghhhhhh) I hear them comin'
Scream (Aghhhhhh) I hear them comin'
Scream (Aghhhhhh) I hear them comin'
Scream (Aghhhhhh) I hear them comin'
I hear 'em comin'
I see 'em comin'
Scream (Aghhhhhh) I hear them comin'
Scream (Aghhhhhh) I hear them comin'
Scream (Aghhhhhh) I hear them comin'
I see 'em comin'
I hear 'em comin'

[Silkk the Shocker]
P this bitch got me trippin', man the ghetto got me 'noid
I be like eyes open turnin' both of my toys
These daydreams sometimes turn to nightmares
I be tryna shake shit, but it seems to be like right there
I know some niggas that make deals with the Devil for a short time to live good
But when it's all over they'll see the day they'll be taken out the hood
You can't see that I'm runnin'; you're chased by the Grim Reaper
'Cause he catch you while you're creepin' and I'll catch you while you're sleepin'
I'm surrounded by evil thoughts and also evil spirits
But I could scream, but ain't nobody gon' see or fucking hear it
Fatalities in closed caskets, it seems it got me scarred
Visions of cemeteries, tombstones, and penitentiary bars
To get by niggas stay high, we get high off weed and swishers
I used to fuck everybody, like Nina and her twin sister
Believe me, before I'm comin' to get ya
I'll have yo family reminiscing on your picture talking 'bout how much they miss ya
"One two I'm comin' for you
Three four I'm kickin' up in your door"
This whole life, it seems to be a bad dream
Scream as loud as you want, but ain't nobody gon' hear your scream

[Hook]
