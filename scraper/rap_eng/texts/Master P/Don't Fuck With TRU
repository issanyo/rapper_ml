What now? (stupid motherfucker) what now motherfucker?
I told you bitches, stop talkin all that motherfuckin shit

Mow I'm fuckin wit you, now try your lives
While I put this fuckin bullet in your dome
You dumb nigga, I told y'all to leave us alone
How many niggas got a dolla can't top my shit (my shit)
All these bitch motherfuckers, quit ridin my dick (my dick)
You run your motherfuckin mouth like you a broad or somethin (bitch)
Niggas actin like they motherfuckin hard or somethin

Fool I'm nothin but TRU C-Murder Bossalinie of this rap game (rap game)
Bitch I'm rich nigga you know my motherfuckin name
Big bee hive boy and P and Bossalinie (Bossalinie)
On the tank that'll make you wear smelly
And we don't give a lily fuck about the laws (fuck the laws)
We got big balls (big balls) ghetto supastar drivin big cars
Now if you eva in my hood nigga holla at me (holla at me)
And if you eva wanna fight then throw a dolla at me (ya bitch)
Now the tank will decide if you wanna live or die (die)

[Chorus]
I told you motherfuckers don't fuck wit TRU

Now try your lives while I put this fuckin bullet in ya dome
You dumb nigga, I told y'all to leave us alone

[Silkk the Shocker]
I told you niggas don't fuck wit us
Now I'm makin you niggas gettin clowned

And plus bitch look, we do it all

See I'll put this gun back nigga
And I'll bust ya all
I ain't give a fuck what ya name is
I ain't give a fuck what y'all call
Niggas wanna probably just... bust for fun
Niggas ain't gonna ever ever, not bust no guns
Niggas is way down the street talkin bout what the fuck y'all done
At the most niggas, probably wanna cuss and run
Now we self made million-aires
We make the money, money don't make us (make us)
If y'all was us, and we was y'all then I would hate us (ehehe)
Y'all talk about how y'all wanna be us
Y'all ain't nuttin but a bunch of hood critics
It's cause we rap now, shit y'all still would hit it

[Chorus]

[Master P]
TRU niggas gone ride wit me
The ghetto's the NBA and I'm the lottery
Pick from the streets... from the South to the East
You the Beauty I'm the Beast
Fuck these niggas they know who P
From rags to riches, from quarter to seven-fifty
Holla Hoody Hooo and my niggas gonna deal with ya
I got the game from my homies
And y'all haters, y'all can't hold me
Niggas rappin bout niggas on records like the 80's
Nigga y'all niggas phony

[Chorus]
