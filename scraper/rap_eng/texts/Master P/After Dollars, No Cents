[Intro]
Come one, come all, TRU niggas ball (I told ya)
I know there's niggas out there waitin' fo' tha fall

[Hook]
After dollars, no cents
From shabs to Benz
From cheddar to cheese
Tryna pay tha rent
After dollars, no cents
From shabs to Benz
From cheddar to cheese
Nigga, tryna pay tha rent

[Verse 1]
I'm a hustla, balla, nigga G's, cut ki's
Gats for enemies, freeze, hundred degrees
Kill, robbery; soldiers, born to ride
Killers, born 2 die; mommas, born to cry
Wild like the lone fuckin' ranger
Niggas from the South keep one up in the chamber
Lord knows when ya enemy is quick
That's why niggas watch a nigga's back, 'cause they gone off that powder, shit
Cane, niggas game, heroin in the vain, fuckin' with there brains
Who the next nigga to get popped by a cop?
Who the next nigga in the hood to get shot?
I hope it ain't me, so I'm strapped up in bulletproof
Nigga on my stomach see, muthafuckin', TRU
Soldier 'til I die, fuck it I won't cry
Look my enemy in the eye
Fuck every nigga that ain't real 'cause we 'bout it
And if I have to die 'cause a nigga gon' shout it
I was born a No Limit soldier, from heart
Cowards run they mouth, but killers don't talk

[Hook]
After dollars, no cents
From shabs to Benz
From cheddar to cheese
Tryna pay tha rent
After dollars, no cents
From shabs to Benz
From cheddar to cheese
Tryna pay tha rent

[Verse 2]
You no Kriss, I'm Kross, y'all ran, we walked
No Limit niggas got Ghetto Dope by pounds and balls
Blowin' tapes up in flames, like weed
Got boxed albums up like ki's from the south to overseas
Nigga's independent and rowdy
Niggas check billboard - number one and 'bout It
That's why niggas tryna get us on the radio
Now niggas might see the P on the video
But a nigga's still true to the gizame
Represent the hood, and every fuckin' nigga that gang-bang
These streets is so real, fool guard ya grill
Smoke 1 fo' the homies that have made it over the hill, 'cause we...

[Hook]
After dollars, no cents
From shabs to Benz
From cheddar to cheese
Tryna pay tha rent
After dollars, no cents
From shabs to Benz
From cheddar to cheese
Tryna pay tha rent

[Verse 3: Silkk the Shocker]
After dollars, no cents, we representin', No Limit
Put it down, Rolex, presidential
Nigga ride everything I done sent you
Nigga, I went from riches to riches
Not muthafuckin' rags to riches
'Cause I always had money
Plus I always had bitches
Young muthafucker tryna get mo' dough
Nigga, act like ya muthafuckers know
I pull a heist solo. Hit em
Fo' they gee'z low, lay low, crow. Get a bien 2 go. Why
Ain't you ever know, don't crush dimes, and mo mo's
Nigga, runnin' from tha po-po's, high from a low low
Take a trip together to Acapulco. But show those, put ya
Breasts right up under my polo's, nigga strapped with a 44'
And I'm solo. To try testin' the best nut and that's a no no
365 days, 24-7, I'm bout my richez, see money is a must, everything is a plus
Including weed and bitches

It went from $18.5 a key, not $18.5 fo' me, C and P to do a show
Act like y'all know
Ghetto millionaire
Ship and guard the dope

Master P

You know me, we have Silkk & P, ugggggggghhh!!!
