Whats up nigga where the weed at?

(/Intro)

This cowboys gone ride to California
They got that green sticky weed when its on ya
(Yee-haw) Hit the bay area to holla at the people
Forty Whodi done changed his phone and his beepa
Now Im tweekin for that green sticky dank
(gotta have it 2x)
Roll falayo(?) back to Richmond but it gotta stank
(say it again)
Went to the house alone but it was closed
(what happened fool?)
DeAndre ain't doin nothin hes got home he's on parole
(Yee-Haw!)
Went to the Hilltop Mall headed straight to Oakland
35 saps(?) say its a drought yall must be jokin
Got on the great bridge didn't stop till I get to Frisco
(Yee-Haw!)
Gotta couple bags of that dank now its official
Gotta concert to do down in la leezy
And if I run out Snoop Dogg say he got me fo sheezy
Now yall know why I love California
Cuz my mamma out there got that stank on ya
Hold up man bring me back to Richmond I forgot to see my momma
