[Master P talking]
Yo, yo, yo man let me tell ya bout this girl I met man
(Another watoosie lookin' bitch, huh man)
Nah man, I'm tellin' you
(Another one of them freaky tails hey P)
Nah it ain't another fuckin' freak tails man
This girl named Dana, you can bang her man

[Master P]
There once was this girl named Dana
The dick was the only thing that contained her (Yeah)
She had real big tits, built thick as fuck
The girl was fine but the bitch was a slut
Now this is how the shit begins
I met Dana by one of my friends
By Big O just to be exact
We was just chillin' by my homie named Pat
Then I heard a knock on the motherfuckin' door
I said "Who is it?" then she said "Ya know"
Then I unlatched the got damn lock
The girl came in and showed me her cot (Oh yeah)
The bitch said...
(Uh uh, I don't wear no draws, ya damn right)
(Ya won't never catch me with no draws on honey)
(Baby cause I'm everybody's good bitch)

[Hook]
Dana, you can bang her
(Ah but it hurts so good)
Dana, you can bang her
(Ah but it hurts so good) There she go right there, loook, look, look
Dana, you can bang her (That's my sister you talkin' about nigga)
Whoa, whoa, whoa I'm just clownin' I'm just clownin'

[Master P]
Dana, you can bang her is the name of the song
Dana is a bitch that can fuck all night long
And she'll love it if ya have a big dick
One night she came over by my house, listen to this
I called her baby, she grabbed my dick
She sucked it like a bottle and drove me crazy
Then she sucked my nuts and jacked off my dick
Poured honey up my ass and started to lick
That's when I said STOP
The bitch eyes turned green and she said "Give me all ya got"
The bitch hit the kitchen and got some ice
Rubbed it on my nuts and dick and played juggle the dice
Then she jumped up and did a handstand
Upside down, singin' "You're my magic man"
Dick juiced her all in the face
I was about to put on my pants but the bitch said wait (Wait)

[Hook]
Dana, you can bang her
(Ah but it hurts so good)
Dana, you can bang her
(Ah but it hurts so good) I'll give ya something to bang

[Master P]
Now ya know Dana is the neighborhood bitch
In case ya bump into her, she looks like this
She has a tattoo on her ass, a picture of a flower
She drives a 300 ZX, she comes out after hours
She wears real tight clothes and some small little draws
A one night stand, she likes em' six feet tall
But don't fall in love cause you'll get used
To Dana it's a job and your just a toot
Has a body like thunder, make ya just wonder
Lick ya ear, lick ya chest and then she goes under
So be on the lookout, ya need a whip and chain to tame her
And if ya meet a workin' girl named Dana
Ya better watch out because it might be Dana

[Hook]
Dana you can bang her (Ha, ha you got to hook me up with that bitch)
Dana you can bang her (Ah but it hurts so good)
Dana you can bang her (I give head to anybody for free) [* Cheering *]
Dana you can bang her (Ah but it hurts so good)
My whole calendar is open
Dana you can bang her (Ah but it hurts so good)
From January to the end of December
Dana you can bang her (Ah but it hurts so good)
Dana you can bang her (Ah but it hurts so good)
Dana you can bang her (Ah but it hurts so good)
