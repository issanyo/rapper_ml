[Verse 1]
30 G's and with not deep could the game get
4 ki's in the safe and I ain't to be fucked with
Living like a baller done cross to that other level
They bury so many motherfuckers I gotta carry a shovel
Cause I don't play when it comes to my mil man
Its risky seeling that cocain
Watch your ass, or watch your back punk
Cause in Richmond, California motherfuckers ending
Up in a trunk, but I ain't going out like that
I keep on pumping the gage and no limit they got my back
Police keep harassing me all the time
I guess they tripping cause the P done went big time

[Chorus]
I'm making money, fuck a bitch cause I'm paid (I'm living like a hustler)
I'm making money, fuck a bitch cause I'm paid (I'm living like a hustler)
I'm making money, fuck a bitch cause I'm paid (I'm living like a hustler)
I'm making money, fuck a bitch cause I'm paid (I'm living like a hustler)

[Interlude]
Tom Cool and shit, watch you mean by fuck a bitch
What else should I say fuck a bitch

[Verse 2]
Me and the chill we was rolling
Bebbing we was fooling
Wholesale selling
T Dog golding
Seen some bitches at the bus stop
Following with that ass out
Looking for some tricks but I with that bullshit
I'm all about my meal I sell that crack cocaine
I got the wholesale yeah I'm the dope man
Serving the dope fiend for riding the protein
A little B12 and its fast but its crystal clean
Bigger than ever that's clever, I'm making mo' mil
[?], trying to take a nigga to jail
But motherfuck that I ain't going out like that
Selling that crack and bitches talking behind ya back

[Chorus]
I'm making money, fuck a bitch cause I'm paid (I'm living like a hustler)
I'm making money, fuck a bitch cause I'm paid (I'm living like a hustler)
I'm making money, fuck a bitch cause I'm paid (I'm living like a hustler)
I'm making money, fuck a bitch cause I'm paid (I'm living like a hustler)

[Verse 3]
Check the Rolex its time to pick the mail up
Slanging and banging, yeah that's how I came up
Strapped on the bulletproof vest for some foul play
A nine on my lap, and on my dash is my AK
My operation run smooth, my money is always there
Cause niggas know I can act a damn fool
Now its time to move on my pager ranging
Reach my the mobile phone so I can see who's hanging
But if it's a broke bitch damn I hang it up
Cause a nigga ain't got time to get his dick sucked
