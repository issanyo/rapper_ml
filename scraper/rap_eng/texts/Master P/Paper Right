Rick has a ounce of crack, turn that to a whole joint
Then he got that nina and he turned that to a whole point
Yeah I break them pounds down, never got that brown, brown
Take it to my homie crib and then I break it down, down
Used to flood this whole shit, just like the surround sound
... already...used to go and pound pound
Just to get a whole one, copy he gonna throw one
Omelly in the kitchen whipping white until his nose run
Then I met my nigga Mill, hit me with that trick or treat
Took her to the south side and I was right back in the week
Fresh from out of jail cell, right back out there in the streets
Yeah I was out on bail now it's time to pay these lawyers fees
30 charges pending and the cops can come and quote on me
PD ain't gonnna do shit but just sit me in that court and plee
And I ain't trying cop out, looking for a knock out
Highschool I dropped out, so I can sling that rock out

I'm a hustler nigga, all night
Till I get my fucking paper right
Pass the ball, that's a alley hoop
And ... that's a bently coop X 2

I'm on my grind and I don't sleep
Don't fuck with you haters, not the police
Nigga client trying to give me for a half a key
I got my young niggas that'll put ya ass right to sleep
This ain't a sport boy, I'm pistol pete
Dribbling that ball thru the hood they call me CP3
I did it once now I'm back bitch look at me
No need for album motherfucker and we in the streets

I'm a hustler nigga, all night
Till I get my fucking paper right
Pass the ball, that's a alley hoop
And ... that's a bently coop X 2

Warm out that south side
Rider die we shoot to kill
Wake up in the morning real
Grab my keys and shine my grill
Used to be broke now my status on heavy weight
Passing through my hood I'm good
I told you I'm gonna get that cake
Errybody nodes me, you can even quote me
I'ma chase that money, get that money, yeah I'm floating
Put my whole team on, we rocking stupid stones
Right back to the block cause my hustle game strong
Unanimous decision I don't see no competition
We beat them to submission, cooking work in gramas kitchen
I'm the bread winner, and I just ate but still I'm hungry
Hungry for that money, with my niggas I'm 100
I'm thugging till the death of me
Feed me weed and Hennesey
Out here where these killas be I'm ... don't fuck with me
Black cold pay job, I did it for my hellya
Gotta get that money, so much money, boy I tell ya

I'm a hustler nigga, all night
Till I get my fucking paper right
Pass the ball, that's a alley hoop
And ... that's a bently coop X 2

OK,I'm ripping, flipping, chickens with the pot until its all bad
Hands for that pound fear nigga we ain't playing fair
I play this game for keeps, big bad wolf, so you sheeps
Bout my paper, I'm a beast ima show up were you sleep
Dressed in all black with the beam all out of focused
Take ya head up of ya shoulders ain't no simple way should know dis
Nigga it's open season, I hit the block runnin im a huslling motha fucka u ain't takin nuthin from me Get money
I had to grind, niggas got tired of being broke
When all I see is poverty, plus the economy so low
Like fuck a job I supply the ... if you a ...
Go for 23 5 you want it then come and purchase
Me and my niggas in the kitchen we flip mo chickens then church
Dont ask me to put you on, you weren't here with me when I was hurting
Bitch i got it on my own from selling work to the verses

I'm a hustler nigga, all night
Till I get my fucking paper right
Pass the ball, that's a alley hoop
And ... that's a bently coop X 2
