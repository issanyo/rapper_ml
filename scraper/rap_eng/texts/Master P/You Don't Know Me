You can start on my teem ma come n represent and
I can treat you better than that looser ever did
Cuz u dont deserve the type of stress that he give
I know im young but I can treat you right
And if he trippin then you need to b with me tonight
Ah and baby he dont have an ounce of respect for u thats y I think is Gangsta how u backed off and left the dude

If u need to get away take the Benz or the Hummer and
You say I dont know enough about you but I just can't see myself being Without you
