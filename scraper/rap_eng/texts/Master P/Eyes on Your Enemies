[Verse 1: Mia X]
And the lady America was finally slaughtered
And divided into 3 quarters
Her children who was fit fell, peace
Battlin', golden', platinum
Friends of terror and endless bloodshed
Pity was not spared for no man, woman, child or rapper
And believe
For his rap was felt by everyone
And this time when trust had no meaning
Family and friends who survived destroyed one another
Decided to the world
Love, peace, and brotherhood
Soldiers, high ashes to survival
Master P
To open up a path to reality
For some, judgement

[Verse 2: Master P]
The devil took the straps off my nigga legs
The Virgin Mary came when my homie bleed
Too many fuckin' thieves and enemies
The vultures pecked the mouths for the green cheese
I watched his soul leave his clothes left him cold
On these streets, anything goes
He was on the road
It took 'em ten to do him in
The killas fled, damn, but they'll be back again
He was Polo'd down with the matchin' socks
I mean stuffed like a turkey with a half a key of cooked rocks
The reaper came and took him
I saw the tears from my baby mama's eyes over look him
As I walk through the shadow's of death
Where no rapper or no man can spare no breath
The kingdom of freedom is all they said
Why the shackle and chain?
My homie's life slain
From the cradle to the grave every soldier shall ride
Bite the apple of eternity (uggggHH)
Every mother will cry

[Chorus: Master P]
Keep your eyes on your enemies, and watch your friends
Put your life in your own hands, or your life will end
Keep your eyes on your enemies, and watch your friends
Put your life in your own hands, or your life will end

[Verse 3: Silkk the Shocker]
Now who's to say if it's the beginning or ending
Start to finish
Losin' or winnin'
I'm trapped in a whole world of sin
Who's to say your life is worth more than mine
Should I give my heart to the President so he can live and I can die?
Now my whole life I was scared
The only judge is god
But why do I (we) live by these man made laws
Ten commandments they say do not steal or kill
But I lost to many niggas and some say they split my wig for meal
Heaven, leadin' up to the steps
Everything I do wrong in my days is leading to my death
And even though I never see
I believe there's a god
But I hate when your best friend turn to your enemy
When times is hard

[Chorus: Master P]
Keep your eyes on your enemies, and watch your friends
Put your life in your own hands, or your life will end
Keep your eyes on your enemies, and watch your friends
Put your life in your own hands, or your life will end

[Verse 4: Master P]
As the sand slowly poured
I see flashes of life
Time started ticking it's the end of my life
Blind fo' his eyes when he look at god
Behold no man or your life destroyed
He took many prophets and poured to the kingdom
Big ones and small ones
Good ones and mean ones
As the angel came the ghetto from hell
Some words of peace cuz they didn't know no better
So they sold to the pitch-forks of the fire
Do g's go to heaven or just young niggas retire
Crosses burned cuz they souls was scarred
Hoping for second chance but ain't none
'Cause it's yo' final call

[Chorus: Master P]
Keep your eyes on your enemies, and watch your friends
Put your life in your own hands, or your life will end
Keep your eyes on your enemies, and watch your friends
Put your life in your own hands, or your life will end
