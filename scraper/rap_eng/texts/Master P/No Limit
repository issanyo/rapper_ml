(Master P Talks)
No limit is looking to going to another level, and I know there is another level From where we at
You know, its constantly Everyday I get up Im thinking what can I do?

(Verse 1:Bizzy Crook)
Boy from the south
Up top
I will never drop
'less im in a F**king drop-top
You was never hot!
I got clout
Bout to blow
Word is out
Drug dealers wanna clean they money out
Purple sprite, Every night
Girls kissing girls, they ain't even dike
That ain't even right
She could f**k tank she ain't even mine
I don’t even mind what its hitting fo'
Im just focused on the reason that she stripping for
Dade county we in this h*e and im in this cake like my birthday
New York thats my second home, and I got that off my first tape
F***ed her once and that h*e loved it
She flew out on her own budget
Told yall ni***s im self made, and they hands out like I owe something
I made it on my own so you know
100K 'fo I was on so you know
B**ches coming through when they clock out, What is that about?
I just always knew I'd be the man and never had a doubt
I've become a hypocrite, my dawg smoke I told em quit
As I sip this double cup like ain't this sh*t supposed to be pink?
F**k it hit take one when its late
Just to spend all my cash on this same girl who probably making more than I make

(Hook)
I don’t see no limit
Never give me no limit
See me come through in that old school off white Lexus you think its Master P up in it
Bumping no limit

And I cussed her a** out like I don’t need no limits
