[Chorus: Afficial]
Yall niggas can't roll how we roll
Live how we live stroll how we stroll
Yall niggas can't roll how we roll
Live how we live stroll how we stroll

[Master P]
I got a mansion in the hills but got apartment in the bricks
I don't fucked supermodels but im married to ghetto chicks
Ball in the NBA on the streets slang quarters
Made ESPN for slangin 3's at Vince Carter
I got a car lot of Benz's one in every color
My sons only 10 and own a bubbleeye baby hummer
I got a pink diamond in a safe worth about 20 karatz
But I still hang wit thug niggas in the hood like T. Harris
They should call em Arnold Shwartzeneger cuz I carry gold 4-5's
And my mission in life is to make millions til I die
They should retire my jersey cuz everything I ship be platinum
And if you ain't wit No Limit you don't know what's happenin

Chorus:

[Afficial]
F-L-A-L damn that's E-S
Still spit game get head up in the G-S
Rap game nice ball game nice
Whole squad nice even when im shootin the dice im nice nice
Even when im knowing im wrong im right right
You prolly catch me rollin a blunt that's tight tight
And everywhere im going im hearin A A
Put a hand on my brother look niggas wouldn't dare
16 guns got me 16 trials
16 boss got you 16 thous
16 shots get you 16 wholes
My wholes fire eatin plus you niggas don't know

Chorus:

[Afficial]
Money talks bullshit walks that's the rules of the game
Push my rover to the limit I abused the range
Change cars like my clothes including shoes
Wit a mansion in the hills wit 100 plus rooms
I love cash but go to jail just to workout
Get a year for G-P get big and get out
I should sit out a season and quit rap for a while
So I can go down south wit platinum teeth when I smile
Excersion heavy milage rims like 30 inches
Trucks so big I could scoot like 30 bitches
Yall money short like 30 midgets
Giani suit or No Limit gear I do buisenss
