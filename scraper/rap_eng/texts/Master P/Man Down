Don’t even get no realer than this you know
But I bet you one thing
Every person back here probably own a gun
So that’s what we talk about
And that’s real

You got it right now
Pull up on a n*gga on Fairfax
Strip a n*gga down to his air mats
OG told me kill him
Take a bitch stick her in a building
All these n*ggas talking about Papi
Project n*gga in the lobby
My man said n*gga we gonna hit him in the head
On the spread n*gga gonna get body
Planned out murder get your head right
Pulling up slow get the headlights
Slide on n*gga at the red light
Didn’t even get to turn that’s dead right pump
Jumped out the Chevy with a AK
Hit the n*gga first grade J
Park the n*gga trunk get the money get the AK
N*gga we the real deal
N*gga we don’t play play
Hold up

Ride with my vato
Catch a n*gga slipping out Rascals

Homie young shooters got shooters
Pull up on em cross back just do it

[Verse 3]
Alley Boy like a raw G
Gonna ride in the front yo at least
N*gga we gonna pull up as a krill
Lowdown n*gga don’t pay me
Working this bitch on the daily
Most people say N*ggas two shady
Running around drawing my lead on daily
[?]
Drawn that n*gga blood gone crazy
But I do it for the Rolls
Everywhere I go gotta keep me a pistol
Man down I’ll kill me a n*gga
We fight that n*gga
Pull up at a note South Side n*gga
Ain’t no love don’t drill em
Working my muscle
LA ain’t doing no trusting
Try that shit I’m gonna bust ya
That’s why I don’t love em
Except that we fall on no rubble
LA enjoying the struggle
Raising his rifle
Spin in a circle no cipher
I’ll shout in your face if I like it
And my money goes double and triple

Pull up on em like some mother fucking pop toys

Too many of them being my papers

Flexing on you and your bitch (you and your bitch)
