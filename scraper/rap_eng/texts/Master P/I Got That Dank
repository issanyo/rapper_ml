Silkk (talking) :

Let's go to commerical break for are you chronic smokers
Now hit it for 10 and hold it for 20
(*coughs* I can't do that fool)

Verse 1:

I'm out of dank, my 40's halfway gone
I called my boy King up on the mobile phone
Get a bag, get a bag, of that ziggety zag
Careful don't twerk, cause them niggas smoke that giggety grass
And 5 0 run up on a nigga G
They ain't catching niggas like the fucking piggety P
See I be ballin' ballin' ballin' through the Richtown
She got the gat some motherfuckers better lay down
Laying candy on the stripes with the giggety fold
I'm riding Dayton's sideways 'till they giggety old
To get a ounce of that motherfucking giggety stank
Cause if it don't stank, then it ain't real dank
I got the juice,  you got the juice, well pass the gin nigga
Get the gauge for the jackers, show'em chrome triggers
Motherfuckers in the game straight clocking cheese
Like RBL say niggas don't smoke no bammer weed

Chorus:

You got the gin and juice, I got the dank nigga
You got the gin and juice, I got the dank nigga
You got the gin and juice, I got the dank nigga
You got the gin and juice, I got the dank nigga
You got the gin and juice, I got the dank nigga
You got the gin and juice, I got the dank nigga

Verse 2:

Pass me the bud, I'm on the green leaves
I wanna feel like I'm swimming the fucking seven seas
Chronic sack and I'm fucked with the indo
You ain't down with the mob, you out the window
It's a drought so we ain't sharing our fucking chronic sack
Put it in my brown pipe, smoke it up like crack
A head rush, better duck, once again it's on
Master P danked out, Mr. Al Capone
With the indonesia
Blowin up the spliffs with the bitches and the skeezers
Gettin' you perked up off the diggety dope
Ain't giving a fuck about the jackers and the 5 0
And most niggas get yiggety yanked
I get 3 for 2, when I buy my diggety dank
Grab the gat, I need a 40, bought to get toast
Sideways (sideways) to the liquor store

Chorus:

You got the gin and juice, I got the dank nigga
You got the gin and juice, I got the dank nigga
You got the gin and juice, I got the dank nigga
You got the gin and juice, I got the dank nigga
You got the gin and juice, I got the dank nigga
You got the gin and juice, I got the dank nigga
You got the gin and juice, I got the dank nigga
You got the gin and juice, I got the dank nigga
