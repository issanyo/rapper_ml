[Intro: Lil Romeo + Hilary Duff]
Yo Hilary, this Romeo
And you know what?
We gonna make 'em dance this Christmas
Left, right
Now shake (tell me)
What you want? (tell me, tell me)
What you want?
Tell me a story
I believe, oh, I believe all things are possible on Christmas Eve
Okay, okay...

[Verse 1: Lil Romeo]
It was the night before Christmas
And all through the house, not a creature was starring
Not even a mouse
The stockings were hung by the chimeny with care
In hopes that Saint Nick soon would be there
Me, my sistas, and brothas getting ready for bed
Can't wait to get toys for more to break bread
Mom's on her pillow in her pajamas, Pop's silk
Santa Claus is coming, leave the cookies and milk

[Chorus: Hilary Duff + Lil Romeo]
Tell me a story
I believe, oh, I believe all things are possible on Christmas Eve
(Wish for it, you just might get it, okay?)
Every time I hear that rhyme, I love it even more
Tell me a story about the night before

[Verse 2: Lil Romeo + Hilary Duff]
Now could it be a dream?
I think I heard noise
Jumped out the bed
It's the no limit voice
I ran to the window
Creep, creep
Bright red, shining, it's my new Hum-V
Snow in the south
Hmm, that's kinda silly
Is it Santa Clause, or is it my uncle Willy?
Now he don't play games, but this when it feel really
But I seen eight tiny reindeer 'bout to come near me, c'mon
(Tell me a story)

[Verse 3: Lil Romeo]
Okay, you wanna know?
Check it out..
Now, Santa called them by names
Dasher, Dancer, Prancer
They all came
Vixen, Comet, Cupid
Eyes droopy
Long ears, looked just like Snoopy
Can't forget Donder and Blitz
Three Kings, they was carrying the gifts

[Chorus: Hilary Duff + Lil Romeo]
Tell me a story
I believe, oh, I believe all things are possible on Christmas Eve
(Wish for it, you just might get it, okay?)
Every time I hear that rhyme, I love it even more
Tell me a story about the night before
(Wish for it, you just might get it)

[Bridge: Hilary Duff]
Reindeers are leaping
Flying so high to the moon and the stars that are high in the sky
Going up and around, just see how they do
Same thing they go
Ringing their bells just see if it's true

[Verse 4: Lil Romeo]
Ain't about the gifts, but I'm glad Santa came
Thanks for the video games and the bling bling
My little sista and brotha like the trains
I'm just glad for the love you bring
So you better not shout and you better not pout
Y'all know what I'm talking about
Merry Christmas to all and have a good night
Hilary, you know what to write

[Break: Hilary Duff + Lil Romeo]
Tell me a story
Tell me a story (wish for it, you just might get it)
Wish for it, you just might get it, okay

[Chorus: Hilary Duff + Lil Romeo]
Tell me a story
I believe, oh, I believe all things are possible on Christmas Eve
(Wish for it, you just might get it)
Every time I hear that rhyme, I love it even more
Tell me a story about the night before
(Wish for it, you just might get it, okay?)

[Outro: Hilary Duff]
Tell me a story
Tell me a story
