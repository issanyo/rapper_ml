Let me be, let me live, okay

I live my biz who im with, what i did
What i did
Why you can't let me live
Just let me live
How you gon hate on a kid
Hate on a kid, come on
I live my biz who im with, what i did
Who im with, what i did
Why you can't let me live
Just let me live
How you gon hate on a kid

Picture me, yellow coupe, candy corilla
My game so cold i could freeze all the mirrors
And i get with you im an entertainer
Bet on rome cause thats a no brainer
They say yes cause we shake em up
Everybody at the dance floor shake shake with us
The new no limit we can't be touched
Beat boy trashed the bomb
Everybody else mushed, hushed
Like the answer hit a quick dirty
Rome with security, nothin else can't hurt me
And dont worry i stay focus in
And still beatin out the block
And i think that can't be in it

I live my biz who im with, what i did
What i did
Why you can't let me live
Just let me live
How you gon hate on a kid
Hate on a kid, come on
I live my biz who im with, what i did
Who im with, what i did
Why you can't let me live
Just let me live
How you gon hate on a kid

Guess whos back another billboard blocka
Toppin up the game with uncle silkk shocka
Dad let me loose, told me to burn up the boot
Did it crackin, lil rome, daddy mackin
Im complete rappin, game not lackin
The more i do it the more my money gon be sackin
Plus i got doughs even though i got those
Still respect mom and dad house, okay
The new kid on the block, yeah thats me
From the magazine covers, movies to tv
Shake shake them haters, its contagouis
The new no limit, lil rome yall can't fade this

I live my biz who im with, what i did
What i did
Why you can't let me live
Just let me live
How you gon hate on a kid
Hate on a kid, come on
I live my biz who im with, what i did
Who im with, what i did
Why you can't let me live
Just let me live
How you gon hate on a kid

Now when rome first drop yall thought it was a game
Comparin him with the kids
He had little in front of his name
Energizer bunnies, man we last longer
75 million records wordie we got stronger
Can't stop this only the beginning
The new no limit, we in this to win it
Rome, richie rich, im the ghettoville
The first born to son word, a couple of mill
Had george on the bently, baby swooped it up
New from
Grade a diamonds, you know we gon flung
On every televison station but i ain't want it

I live my biz who im with, what i did
What i did
Why you can't let me live
Just let me live
How you gon hate on a kid
Hate on a kid, come on
I live my biz who im with, what i did
Who im with, what i did
Why you can't let me live
Just let me live
How you gon hate on a kid
