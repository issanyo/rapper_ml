[Intro]
My heart won't let you go
I love you Romeo
You're my Juliet girl you know!

[Chorus - Solange]
Love has truly been good to me
Not even one sad day
A memory, I had since you've come my way
I hope you know, I'd gladly go
Anywhere you take me
And ain't no limit to this love
I'll follow you to the moon and the sky above

[Verse 1 - Lil Romeo]
The first time, I met you, I didn't sweat you
My Juliet that I'd catch you
Gave you the key to my heart, you unlocked it
A perfect match, you the plug I'm the socket
As time moved on, we become friends
I knew it was love at first sight and it wasn't about the dividends
You was there when I needed you
I remember writing letters on the road, I wanna be with you
I know we young and we got time
Little souljahs need love, so girl I wanna make you mine
We can roll together, go to shows together
My best friend, girl, let's grow together

[Chorus - Solange]
Love has truly been good to me
Not even one sad day
A memory, I had since you've come my way
I hope you know, I'm gladly go
Anywhere you take me
And ain't no limit to this love
I'll follow you to the moon and the sky above

[Verse 2 - Lil Romeo]
We could walk together, roll buses together
Your mom called us Killer bees, we stuck together
We at parks playin' hide and go seek
I find you or you find me
This was meant to be, they called us little one and shortie
Find hugged up at every school party
We studied together, balled together
Somebody said Cupid, it must have brought us together
I love your cute eyes, and you love my tight braids
Played video games almost everyday
And when we're not together, we're on the phone
Talkin' 'bout our first kiss and we don't want to be alone

[Chorus - Solange]
Love has truly been good to me
Not even one sad day
A memory, I had since you've come my way
I hope you know, I'm gladly go
Anywhere you take me
And ain't no limit to this love
I'll follow you to the moon and the sky above

[Verse 3: Lil Romeo]
And I remember so, well, how your smile made me feel bright
Like the sunshine, I'm so glad that you mine
You my Juliet, I never let the jealous ones between
And that's a safe bet
And we can get to studying after school is over
Homework is a must so you can come over
And afterwards we can hit the mall Sip Icee's
And cotton candy after that come chill with the family

[Outro - Solange]
Got to tell you how you threw me
I'm so happy that you came in here and changed my world
Bye bye sadness, hello Romie
You're the only boy
That's why Solange is so in love
I'll follow you to the moon in the sky above
