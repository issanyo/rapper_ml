[Intro]
With Evolution... Comes Revolution
With Slavery... Come Freedom
Pick up your history book and see
How my people was able to create
Doctors, Lawyers, Leaders, Soldiers, Pro Athletes
Entertainers, Politicians,Entrepreneurs...
We came a long way
But we got a long way to go

[Hook]
Tell 'em who my people is
Ya'll know who my people is
Man they shed so many tears
Tell' em who my people is (x4)

[Master P]
From Georgia to Alabama to Mississippi
They threw him in the slammer
That boy didn't have not rights
He tried to live his life
They burned crosses in his yard
Just to scare his wife
Thanks to him we dream
January 15
That's why we celebrate Martin Luther King
Times real though
Kickers kick no field goals
Harriet Tubman...
Built the underground railroads
Medgar Ever...
Took us to the promised land
While we running round here
With guns in our hands
Don't even exercise...
Our right to vote
And blame the government
Cause our people still broke
Young athletes don't know who Babe Ruth is
Bet you gang bangers know who Snoop is
Booker T. Washington opened up the school doors
Thanks to Frederick Douglas
Slavery is no more

Refrain (x4)

[Romeo]
Similar to Bessie Coleman, Malcom X
Cause I'm bout to make history
Like a cold war
I ain't shooting at the enemy
Why I feel like I'm living up in slavery
I need a strong woman kinda like Ms. Winfrey
Hey bay-bay, Hey bay-bay
You could be my bay-bay-bay
If you looking for a soldier
I could lead your army O-kay-kay-kay
I'm proven I got ready J
If rap was ball, I'll be MJ
We living in a world where they still got KKK
I wanna be a leader like True Blackwell
Tell ya teacher, I'm here to help
My pants sag, But I wear a belt
Police pull us over
Then they call their friends for help
Why they need 10 cops?
I' m just rolling by myself
That's a punk mentality
I ain't going no where
Try to stop violence
We don't need another Red Scare
I got the blood of a king
It's a straight fact
We been down for too long
We bout to bounce back

[Hook](x4)

[Master P]

We was gonna keep it street
And we gonna learn something
At the same time
Now ya'll know who I am
And ya'll know who my people are
