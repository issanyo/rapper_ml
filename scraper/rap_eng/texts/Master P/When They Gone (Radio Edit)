[Verse 1]
It's 1995, a lot of brothers done died
A lot of sisters, and mamas, and fathers
And aunties, and grandmamas left to cry
Now he nothing but a memory, he used to be a friend to me
Said he never die but now he's 6 feet deep, with a tombstone
Oh my god my brothers gone
And I don't even fucking think I can go on
Cause it hurts to lose someone you love
To this madness of children's murdered, shoot em up in the name of drugs
Doctor pumped chest, daddy said let him rest
A team rolled up and put him to his final death
Hands got cold, god rest his soul
He walked out his body to another fucking episode
The window open , they put him in the final front
And you know what happens in the end

[Chorus]
I wish I could seen him before he died
Talk to him but when they gone that's when we realize
I wish I could seen him before he died
Talk to him but when they gone that's when we realize
Front, back, side to side
But who would be the next nigga to roll in that black ride
Front, back, side to side
It might be you to be the next victim to take a ride in the black ride

[Verse 2]
Just another homicide, for that west county times
Fools gettin took out the game, with a fucking proper don hittin' deep
I toss in my sleep, but will a young nigga live to see 23?
Killing dont phase me, fools think I'm crazy
Muslims on every corner handed out the daisy's
Name fresh on the wall, ain't no final call
Used to slang bean pies now it's bout white ball
Only 15, already got a beef
And work in the ghetto like Jack Tucker work some beans
Livin off a high, rollin on this ride
Bitches on the side, but only give them 2 weeks time
Ain't that a shame, took him out the game
Same fool he used to roll with yelled out his name
Popped him in the chest, couldn't where his vest
The day his kid took his first step, his took his last breath

[Chorus]
I wish I could seen him before he died
Talk to him but when they gone thats when we realize
I wish I could seen him before he died
Talk to him but when they gone thats when we realize
Front, back, side to side
But who gonna be the next nigga to roll in that black ride
Front, back, side to side
It might be you to be the next victim to take a ride in the black ride

[Verse 3]
Bring the white sheets somebody bring the yellow tape
The ghetto took him under, today will be a sad day
Ain't no time to cry, no time to shed no tears
You know the way he died the same way he lived
The fool was a killer found him dead on his knees
Same room he left his wife and kid left to grieve
Hoping is a nightmare, one pop and he's outta there
God rest his soul, left his kid in a wheelchair
Scared for his life, his daddy took ghetto flight
Left the funeral and mama said boy you know it's gonna be alright
But now he's gone, ain't nobody to run his home
Another kingpin stripped from that ghetto throne
Folks that's the game of life, ain't no time to think twice
The same fool he trusted with now sleeps with his wife
Khakis on, snapped him in that whiplock
Another nigga flip locked, got popped for slangin that crack rock
But now he's gone, Amazing Grace was his last song
Six ballers carried out the church to take his ass home
4 members, 3 cousin, 2 El dogs, a cop, and a hearse
Everybody had they lights on , when that starp box lowered down into his grave
See it was sad they was his fucking family misbehaved
His family cried, "but everybody got's to die."
But you won't feel what they feel into someone in your family dies

[Chorus]
I wish I could seen him before he died
Talk to him but when they gone thats when we realize
I wish I could seen him before he died
Talk to him but when they gone thats when we realize
Front, back, side to side
But who gonna be the next nigga to roll in that black ride
Front, back, side to side
It might be you to be the next victim to take a ride in the black ride

[Outro]
