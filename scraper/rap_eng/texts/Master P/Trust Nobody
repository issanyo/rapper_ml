[EA-Ski]
Its kinda funny niggas running up
Trying to show me much love
Cause a motherfucker just dropped an album
Now they wanna kiss ass
But hold up bitch all your getting is a luck pass
Trying to gank me for my ducket
I tried to put you down with the SKI & CMT you said fuck it
Only came around when things was kinda cool
But did you really think I'd go out like a fucking fool
Oh hell no, I kept my shit tight
Now the Ski & CMT is sitting on something right
Your like a gold digging bitch from the neighborhood
Thats why I slide on your ass cause it makes me feel good
All this shit you talk when im not around
Get your crown on nigga but you still ain't down
I got something for ya'll
A nin-millimeter that will drop you to the floor bitch
Cause if I trust ya for a minute
You would have had a motherfucking knife in my back then bent it
I gotta get ya first
Cause a nigga like ? is the nigga that will fuck you the worst
Punk ass nigga kinda jocking now
You ain't down cause I trust nobody

[Chorus/Master P]
I trust nobody x2

[Master P]
One by one in this century
Brothers are dying getting killed
And sent to penitentary's
And your right hand man could have been a snitch
You think like a hoe you go out just like a bitch
So face 'em to the facts bro'
And end up dead like this other nigga I used to know
I guess its kinda sad G
But it really didn't face me til the funeral car passed me
And what about them tagalongs
Them mother mother fuckers that are driving with the lights on
Could have been the killers
But nobody really cares he died on dope dealers
But that dont mean shit, cause a nigga like me pack a 9 and 3 clips
And I dont trust a soul from them nigga by my house
To them niggas down by the store
When niggas say they like me
Thats the same motherfuckers in the game that tried to shice me
Mama say boy you have no friends, ha
I should have listened then
Dour niggas rolled up with the ski-masks
Pointed the tech-nine out the window but they didn't blast
When niggas said freeze P
I thought to myself, huh, this nigga knows me
But I didn't find it funny
Pulled out my motherfucking 9 when they asked me for my fucking money
But he didn't even shoot
He must have didn't have no bullets in the gun no time to think
Im steady pullin' I blast for the driver to the passenger
Four niggas dead in the car I laugh at ya
Now I gotta see, pull of the ski mask of this nigga that was calling me
I guess Its kinda sad, a tear rolled down my eye cause I knew his ass
His name was little Peewe
Thats the same motherfucking nigga I was trying to help G
Good thing I thinked fast, cause if I think a nigga gonna do me
Im gonna do his ass, cause a bitch will get you killed
Niggas like to steal, and ain't no thing is a good dope deal
So I live just like John Montgotti, ha
I Trust Nobody


[Chorus]

[Master P]
Yeah you know what im saying this goes out to all my niggas out there
In the game you know what im saying
You gotta keep your eyes open you know, a lot of niggas try to get
Niggas, and the same nigga that you rolling with could be the nigga
Trying to get you, so a nigga like me you know what im saying
I trust nobody I hope you nigga catch on to what im saying

Peace. Im outtie
