[Master P]
I was born to be a hustler, they labeled me a dealer
Say I grew up to be a killer, like my daddy Percy Miller
Me and Cleo smoking weed, say the whole family cursed
C-Murder innocent, (ughh) NOT GUILTY Man that hit me where it hurt
So fuck y'all Crease, he just wanna be famous
He mad 'cause he Poor and we some rich entertainers
So represent yo hood, we back on the grind
We gon get this bitch crunked like it's 1999
So holla at me, whody, Diesel on the beat
Trow ya middlefingers up to the ponk police
Than pass me the Bubbly, (oh ooh) We We Can Take it to the floor
I ain't Lil Jon but I make them hoes +Get Low+
And make them thugs say fuck y'all, Think we Won't touch y'all
Live with some Bitches that straight gon cut y'all
Grab it - than take me to the booth
Tell the DJ to play this 'cause he fucking with my loot


[Chorus]
Man - I don't give a fuck (oh ooh)
We don't give a fuck (oh ooh)
They don't give a fuck and we gon tear the club up

[Master P]
So duck down, nigga, y'all ready be ready
Me and Silkk come to this bitch, like Jason and Freddy
Look at what y'all did, I was trying to be good
Y'all made me leave the hills and come back to the woods
I'ma blaze like Derreck Anderson, turn green like the hulk
Wild out in the club and make a nigga pop The Trunk
I'm a No Limit Soldier, the Rowdiest in the crew
They may take my gold tooth but they can't fuck with my tattoos
I got a good heart, some bad friends, thats why we Trapped in ....
But a nigga ain't scared to die, do life in the pen
Real niggas don't change when they hit the fucking block
Nigga, free C-Murder, Cuz That's All I Got
I'ma ride with my niggas, I'ma die with my niggas
I ain't roll I light em, so I'ma get high with my niggas
And my cousin came home from jail, man, that boy say he changed
He a motherfucking liar, heard he rollin with the Feds

[Chorus]
Man - I don't give a fuck (oh ooh)
We don't give a fuck (oh ooh)
They don't give a fuck and we gon tear the club up
Say - I don't give a fuck (oh ooh)
We don't give a fuck (oh ooh)
They don't give a fuck and we gon tear the club up

Fake niggas (buck em up)

No Limit in this bitch (ughh) and we gone tear the club up
Fake niggas (buck em up)

[Silkk]
Say you, whody, naw nigga I ain't talk on rap
Bring it to ya crib, where you  live, let him talk about that
I'd rather turn my back on em, than get the gat for em
I got the game all twisted, nigga, lets twist it back for ya
They label me a gangsta, thats how I was, thats how I will be
And it's simple, I can't let no bitch nigga kill me
For real, P - Fo real we
Live a hell of a life-style but we still creep
Got a couple niggas go, but we still deep
Now I got a movie for y'all niggas, who like to act
I'm great with my hands, I'm like Roy Jones with a gat
I'm real a - great hussler, I'm a hyke with rap
(Master P: Nigga, we going triple platinum) Treu, I'ma aight with that
Been in the east and the west, laid back with the players
(...) and P.Miller jump off all type of flavours
You know - yeah, I turn my back to them haters
I got a lot to say to them fake Bitches, but I get back to em later
Now I just - gotta be real with it, left the project but I still visit
For my brothers and a couple of my cousin, you still can get it
So don't make me have to touch you - put your five fingers up
Four of em down, but keep the middle one up and tell em "fuck you"
And scream (oh ooh) if you know you the hardest
If I ain't the one fighting, I'm just trying to get the fight started

[Chorus]
Man - I don't give a fuck (oh ooh)
We don't give a fuck (oh ooh)
They don't give a fuck and we gon tear the club up
Say - I don't give a fuck (oh ooh)
We don't give a fuck (oh ooh)
They don't give a fuck and we gon tear the club up

Fake niggas (buck em up)
Fake hoes (buck em up)
No Limit in this bitch and we gone tear the club up
Fake niggas (buck em up)
Fake hoes (buck em up)
No Limit in this bitch and we gone tear the club up
