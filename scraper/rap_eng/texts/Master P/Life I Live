[Master P talking]
It's like all the shit we done been through, the average company
They probably would've gave up by now
But No Limit, we constantly keep rising to the top
Now it' No Limit East
My boy Short Circuit here, Slay Sean
We laying it down for the 2 G's ya heard me

[Master P & (Slay Sean)]
We went from rags to riches, cued 4-5 to sixes
(Handled our business now we dressin' in finest linen)
Windows tinted, surrounded by the prettiest women
Iced out (E-Class and that's just the beginning)
Worldwide (I'ma live it up) Until I die
(Coast to coast) From the N.O. (Back to the N.Y.)
(Far out, risin' to the top) Not to be stopped
(Untouchable, I'm tellin' you, watch when we drop)
That hot shit (Straight thug for rock shit)
(My click like to pop clips when niggas pop shit)
(My chain let's you know) I'm doin' my thang
(And my ring let's you niggas know) That y'all can't hang
(When I bang, I'm not tryin' to hear) A got damn thang
(It's Slay Sean and P and No Limit's the game)

[Repeated in background of hook]
La-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la

[Hook x2]
Shit it's hard livin' the life I live
Gamblin' hustlin' takin' care of the kids
Can't stop now, my niggas doin' a bit
Get money son and invest that shit

[Master P & (Slay Sean)]
I love my life, rockin' Rollies with ice
(Sippin' Cris, we gettin' ice, my block be hot like spice)
Make a nigga think twice about livin' the life
Been there done that, shit I paid the price
(I seen wigs get split, kids get hit)
(All for the love of money, that's rediculous)
Sometimes I ask how did I get into this
Life ain't fair, that's the reason I don't care
(Hit the street when it's time eat, if it's beef) Draw the heat
(I can't get outta this) I'm in too deep
(Can't sleep, too many jays walkin' a beat)
Had many breaks, got my hustle on in many states
(I went from PA then to VA back to PA)
(Doin' it bouncin' on junx on the freeway)
Gettin' if it's problems you want I'm givin' it
(No if's and's or but's) Whodi we serious

[Master P & (Slay Sean)]
P nearly home, I'm on a new level, new zone
No Limit Communications, whodi I'm slangin' phones
(I ride chrome, fuck bitches till they moan)
(Put em' to sleep, when they wake up I'm gone)
I'm so wrong, tellin' shorties to hold on
They wait for me, my sex game is so strong
Late nights gettin' these tapes right
I take flights around the world tryin' to break mights
(Puffin' weed, Black Dye crushin' me)
(Smokin' out in weather thinkin' they can fuck with me)
(Pop some bees, wild out drop the V)
(Slay Sean yeah we on that watch and see)
(Thanks to P, No Limit is the place to be)
(He believed in me when the eighties had no faith in me)
(Everything is real ain't no fake in me)
(You only heard one side of Slay, this is a taste of me)
