[Master P]
Shake it from the south from the north to the east
Twerk it to the west from the club to the street

[Hook]
Shake that thang, twerk that thang wobble that thang
Let it bounce, let it swing
Shake what your mama gave ya, you look good dats why they hate ya

[Verse 1]
Your probally mixed with coyotes the way that ass be shaking
Put tht hump in your back and you and your girl trade places
Then drop it like it's hot,shake it till they pop
In the back of the club from the bottom to the top
I've been fiending a little but see I'm ready for that
Bend over touchyour toes let that minkie out that dress
No panties, no thong I might take you home
We could do right,or we could do wrong
Where the thug girls at,you might get down
We gotta couple, a lotta we might throw 'em up around
Cuz them girls be actin bad,on the dance floor shakin ass
In the club whodie getting in cash
Ballin them gouches in No Limit bags

[Hook 2x]

[Verse 2: Master P]
Bodies on chrome,tattoos on my arm
My boonopolisat the tele, my babooski at home
I'm bout to act a donkie
I like choclate like brown, but a trompak
Wit curves like a coke bottle
I mean thick like a stallion, but pretty like a super model
Make the waiter drop the drinks
Make a cripple old man take ruffle to the bank
She'll shake it in the morning, shake it in the evening
I don't play Georgia if she can play wheezing
Ride it like a bike, twerk it all night
Grab the wall from the left to the right

[Hook 2 X]

[Master P talking]
I dont care what they say
You been up in the club getting ur paper forever
You look good babooski and the way that thing shaking
You look like a country stallion, YA HEARD ME
Two balls in your back pocket
You could bounce that thing all the way to the top
HOLD UP WAIT A MINUTE THEM NO LIMT BOYZ WE BACK UP IN IT

[Hook 2X]
