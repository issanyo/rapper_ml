-This goes out to my best friend
-My partner
-The only person I can trust in this world
-This for you mom

Momma, this is one thing I still can't realize
How you been so strong when my brother died
You done kept the family together tight
Thinkin about how we gone get throght this sorrow night
This is crazy, I can't sleep nope
Even though I got revenge written across my throat
Five kids and you done lost one
Never had a daddy, but put it on your oldest son
Ain't that a b, leave me to watch the family
To make the bills get paid, you got to live scandalous G
Cause the ghetto got me pressured
Will I die sellin dope, or would I sell a million records
Ohh momma won't you feel me
Even though Ms. ?? said somebody tried to kill P
And you know your boy's sellin dope
But all you say is watch yo back
Cause you don't want to see me go

Chorus: (Repeat 2X)

Momma I don't wanna see you cry
No more tears
Cause I'm deep in the game
Sellin much cocaine

Momma how you be so strong
Even tough the ATF, done kicked down your home
And ran right through and got me
But you still came to see me
And said that you love me
And I know that you real though
Cause when I got out, you's the first one at the door
Knowing that your boy turned into a man
But you done tripped cause I still understand
That I'm trying to make some money
And if I die in this game, I guess that won't be funny
But you still on my side cause you a soldier
You the only friend I got and ma I told ya
One day I'mma change G
Even though the ghetto's crazy, think about your baby
If I make it out this dope game
I know that life won't be the same, momma I gone make a change

Chorus:
