[Intro- Master P]
Oh yeah, I done delivered the mail, all platinum
Ghetto Postage wody
And I can't do nothing for the 2 G'z but make every ghetto bounce
Turn it up, what what what
Bounce!!!

[Chorus]
Wooday, I don't give a fuck no mo'
Wooday, ima bout to slang this dope
Woody, from the north to the south we go
Woody, from the east to da west we roll

[Verse 1]
Now when I do this thang ima do it wild
And I ain't Rakim but I can move da crowd
And when I'm having sex, I make stomachs growl
Now how long can I go, about a couple of miles
Screaming all night long, saying bomb bomb bomb
Saying go big daddy, won't you take me home
Now if this ain't love, lets go to the motel
And if you feeling kinda freaky lets do it on the way there
I like to bark with women, like I'm Bow Wow
And I keep my nine cocked, goes pow pow
Ima souljah, I thought I told ya
You find me sippin' on the 40's or blowing on the dolja
Find me at a party with a pool of bitches
I'm the ghetto Bill Gates, went from rags to riches
Call me ????????  , still throw them thangs
Nigga I'm flexing in a Rolls, but still flossin' my chain
It's Nolimit til' the day that I die
Screaming C-P-3 thats the way I ride
All my uptown warriors, where y'all at
Cause we never leave the house with out our gat
Ya heard me!!!

[Chorus1- x2]

[Chorus2]
Uh no stoppin' no stoppin'
I'm from the south where them girls be boppin'
Take off your braw hoe show them tits
And wobble that thang like the Baddest bitch

[Verse 2]
See I'm a killer, and I don't give a fuck no mo'
It's 2 G'z, I had to fuckin' change my flow
Money, I already got the doe
Nigga platinum, three million went out the door
Nigga ball, I balled in the NBA
Nigga hustle, I hustled from the south to the Bay
That nigga C-E-O, y'all fill in the blank
Who I'm with, I'm with the motherfuckin' tank

[Chorus1- x2]

[Chorus2]
