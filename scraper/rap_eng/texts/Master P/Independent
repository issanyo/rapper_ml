[Intro]
This for every hood nigga chasin' dream
Stay loyal to yourself, nigga
I ain't gotta sell out man
I did this shit from the mud
Shit, brick livin'

[Hook]
I'm independent, unbelievable
They sleeping on a giant, I just get the dough
I just get the dough
I just get the dough
I just get the dough
I said I'm independent, I'm into distribution
I just get the dough
I just get the dough
I said we independent, we into distribution
We just get the dough
We just get the dough


[Verse 1]
Versace smith
No limit nigga, we the fuckin' Taliban
I got bitches all on me, I got hella bands
Throw ya'll nigga's on my motherfuckin' helicopter
Haters talking shit, nigga, we got hella choppers
I don't need a deal, the streets gave me a million dollars
Independent, foreign bitches all in the shower
Nigga hit it once, nigga don't do it twice
Couple of bricks in my motherfuckin' motorbike
Turn that square money into some fuckin' dice
Check yo' paper worth, bitch you ain't livin' right
Nigga, hustle sold dope came up overnight
Never sell my fuckin' soul to the limelight

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Smokin' Cuban cigars, with nigga's lookin' like [?]
My team hella deep the same Oakland Raiders
Nigga all black, like we at a funeral
Bad bitches, let em' sit in the front row
I got money and money and money and money and money and more
These hood nigga's and bitches and nigga's and bitches be cookin' my dope
Butt naked nigga, I don't trust nobody
Tony Montana nigga, call me John Gotti
Servin' them fiends, making em' wait
Cookin' me pies, cuttin' me cake
Ice Cream Man, took me a break
Nigga I'm back, rookies gonna hate
Uh, Kevin Love on these motherfuckin' Timberwolves
Picasso on these nigga's when I'm sellin' jewels

[Hook]
