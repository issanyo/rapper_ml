[Spoken Word Interlude: Master P]
People wanna know what "No Limit" comes from. My grandfather, Big Daddy, was in the military. And, uh, you know, he always said, "Man, them people ain't gon' do nothing for us." So he was like,"Grandson, you need to start your own army." And that's where the tanks and the military thing come from
See, I watched the, the Avon lady in my hood. She popped her trunk and sell her products. So I put all my CDs and cassettes in the back of my trunk and I hit every city, every hood. My grandfather, he said, 'Why you gon' call it "No Limit"?" I said, "Because I don't have no limit to what I could do."
