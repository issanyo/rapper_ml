Before you jump in the game let's get one thing understood

[Verse 1]
Hit the block dressed in white with some baggy Girbaud's
A pocket full of stones, 3 G's and try'na lose these hoes
And the task comin' sick 'cause it's the first of the month
Fiends on my pager like I'm try'na take these fools to lunch
Goin' crazy and ghetto's try'na kill me
My little homie's lost his life, y'all fools feel me
I pack a T 'cause I'm paranoid at night time
Brothas be pullin' jacks, I'm in the hood bustin' gangsta rhymes
And still gotta watch my back in the hood, G
Like Spice1 said those fools livin' like the movies
Little kids get 'bout it, I mean my hood is rowdy
I'm try'na make a dollar out of 15 cents before I'm up and outtie

[Verse Two]
Mr. Ice Cream Man, or call me Master P
I got it 2 for 3, call me if you need some D
Me and my little brother Silkk we be ballin'
Got this thang sewed up from Texas to New Orleans
And 'cross the West Coast where fools get wicked
I'm in the game hella deep, try'na to score a meal ticket
Breakin' fiends off boulders, I mean A-1 soda!
Duckin' the task and try'na hide from the rollers
And hangin' with TRU soldiers, my TRU click we true to this
TRU 2 da G-A-M-E, fool, we ain't new to this
In the hood I got ice cream cones
And if you fiends want a lick, nothing for free that gonna cost you 20 bones
For y'all ballers that won't wait call me on the pager
I got half gallons of milk, fool I got 31 flavors
Mr. I-C-E-M-A-N is on the scene
You betta have my 'fetti if you don't have my ice cream

[Verse 3: Silkk the Shocker + Master P]
Now let's see who owes me cash I gots to go to the grinds and get mine
Fools be try'na check it, wreck it, but it's 'bout that time
See who owes me, pay me now, don't pay me later, crooked alligators
Try'na scheme off the top, but they be like playa haters
I gots 'em 2 for 3, 4 for 5, gots them rocks
For killers I got that 2 for 3, 4 for 5 on Macs 'n' Glocks
You can come and checks my grip, you can come and checks this
But I'm on them triple gold in the 9-skrilla Lexus
Master P in the 500 S-E-L with a triple beam
You scream, I scream, but the fiends screamin' for ice cream

[Outro]
Y'all fools betta recognize
