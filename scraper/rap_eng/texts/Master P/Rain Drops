I see the rain drops falling
So tell me why you can't call me
I said I am so over you
But I hate that I still love you
Don't do it to me baby
Anymore loving drive me crazy
Trying to get over you
You still on my mind
I want you here with me
But I told you I was fine
Where is she now that you calling me
Did you tell her
That this is where you want to be
You put my heart on the road
And drove it to a dead end
And those lies don't attract me
You can take the back seat
I see the rain drops falling
So tell me why you can't call me
I said that I am so over you
But I hate that I still love you
Don't do it to me baby
Anymore loving drive me crazy
Trying to get over you
You still on my mind
I want you here with me
But I told you I was fine
You were running with your friends
When you should've been with me
Playing all these games
And my heart you took the key
No more, No more me and you
No more seeing you
You did it
When it's should've been me and you
I see the rain drops falling
So tell me why you can't call me
I said that I am so over you
But I hate that I still love you
Don't do it to me baby
Anymore loving drive me crazy
Trying to get over you
You still on my mind
I want you here with me
But I told you I was fine
I know you can't feel my pain
So it's very overrated
No thing will never be the same
I know that you will never change
I see the rain drops falling, yeah yeah
So tell me why you can't call me
I said that I am so over you
But I hate that I still love you
Don't do it to me baby, yeah yeah yeah
Anymore loving drive me crazy, crazy
Trying to get over you
You still on my mind
I want you here with me
But I told you I was fine
No more x8
