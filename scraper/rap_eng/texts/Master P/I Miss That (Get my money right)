[Intro]

And we don't stop my nigga
I'm like Donald Trump nigga
Blow it all, come back and get it again you feel me?

Let me tell em, I said

[Verse 1: Meek Mill]
Ricky had an ounce of crack
Turned that to a whole joint
Then he got that nina and he turned that to a whole point
Me i break them pounds down
Never got that brown brown
Take it to my homie crib and then i break it down down
Used to flood this whole shit, just like a surround sound
... for stack we used to going pound pound
Just to get a whole one, cop it he gonna throw one
Omelly in the kitchen whipping white until his nose run
Then I met my nigga Meek, hit me with that trick or treat
Took it to the south side and I was right back in a week
Fresh from out a jail cell, right back out there in the streets
Yeah I was out on bail but now it's time to pay these lawyers fees
30 charges pending and the cops can come to quote on me
PD ain't gon' do shit but just sit me in that court and plea
And I ain't trying cop out, looking for a knock out
High school I dropped out, so I can sling that rock out

[Hook: Master P x2]
Uh, I'm a hustlin nigga all night
Till I get my fucking paper right
Pass the ball, that's a alley-oop
80 pounds that's a Bentley coupe X 2

[Verse 2: Master P]
Uh, I'm on my grind and I don't sleep
Don't fuck with you haters, not the police
Nigga client trying to give me for a half a key
I got my young niggas that'll put ya ass right to sleep
This ain't a sport boy, I'm Pistol Pete
Dribble that ball thru the hood they call me CP3
I did it once now I'm back bitch look at me
Don't live forever mu'fucker and we in the streets

[Hook x2]

[Verse 3 Bengie B]
Born out that south side
Ride or die we shoot to kill
Wake up in the morning real
Grab my keys and shine my grill
Used to be broke, now my status on heavy weight
Passing through my hood I'm good
I told you I'm gonna get that cake
Errybody notice me, you can even quote me
I'ma chase that money, get that money, yeah I'm floating
Put my whole team on, we rocking stupid stones
Right back to the block cause my hustler game strong
Unanimous decision I don't see no competition
We beat them to submission, cooking work in gramas kitchen
I'm the bread winner, and I just ate and still I'm hungry
Hungry for that money, with my niggas I'm 100
I'm thuggin, till the death of me
Feed me weed and Hennesey
Out here where these killas be I'm Bengie B don't fuck with me
Black cold paint job, I did it for my hellya
Gotta get that money, so much money, boy I tell ya

[Hook x2]

[Verse 4: Miss Chee & T.E.C]
OK,I'm ripping, flipping, chickens with the pot until its all bad
Hands for that pound fear nigga we ain't playing fair
I play this game for keeps, big bad wolf, so you sheeps
Bout my paper, I'm a beast ima show up were you sleep
Dressed in all black with the beam all out of focus
Take ya head up of ya shoulders ain't no simple way should know this
Nigga it's open season, I hit the block running I'm a husling motha fucka u ain't taking nothing from me Get money
I had to grind, niggas got tired of being broke
When all I see is poverty, plus the economy so low
Like fuck a job I supply the ... cause you fighting for the ...
Go for 23 5 you want it then come and purchase
Me and my niggas in the kitchen we flip mo chickens then church
Dont ask me to put you on, you weren't here with me when I was hurting
Bitch i got it on my own from selling work to the verses

[Hook x4]

[Outro: Master P]
Uh, thats a bentley Coupe nigga
Just remember my broke is your rich nigga
