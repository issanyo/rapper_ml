[Verse 1]
Yeah I’m in the hood but I love the money
A wise man once told me, you know
Once you get the money, you get everything else
We out them bricks but we rich now
We get the money
Just don’t know what you do to me (It’s No Limit forever)

[Hook]
You take me places I won’t go (Ben Franklin)
I tell you things you really wanna know (Ben Franklin)
You put me in the mood, doing things that basic bitches don’t do
I’m in love wit dollas (I’m in love wit dem dollas)
I’m in love wit dem dollas (I’m getting that money)
Money and power (money and power)
I’m in love wit dem dollas, dollas, dollas (I’m getting this money)

[Verse 2]
When I was broke my uncle gave me like 50 bucks
Work till the same time has got me to double up
Put the soda to the yolk then I whip it up
Bring it back cause surely this will flip it up
All I see was that girl and I thought I was broke
The dough fein tryna get me right by the stoke
My boy shook it and that motherfucker came back
And I’ve been getting money ever since they came back

[Hook]
I’m in love with band, frame, glutton
You take me places I won’t go
Band, frame, glutton
I tell you things you really wanna know
Band, frame, glutton
You put me in the mood, doing things that basic bitches don’t do
Yeah I’m in love wit dollas (I’m in love wit dem dollas)
I’m in love wit dem dollas (I’m getting that money)
Money and power (money and power)
I’m in love wit dem dollas, dollas, dollas (I’m getting this money)

[Verse 3]
Now see momma she a church woman
So I sneak it in her pocket
She don’t want no hustle money but I slipped it and got it
I tell my little sister what you want
Tell my little brother what you want
I got freckles in my pocket and I’m getting what I want
Then I went to that car lot and I bought me a Benz
I took my girl to the mall say I got a pocket full of them bills
And you can still get what you want cause we sitting on them paper
Pistol in my back pocket I don’t fuck with them haters

[Hook]
I’m getting this money
You take me places I won’t go
Band, frame, glutton
I tell you things you really wanna know
Band, frame, glutton
You put me in the mood, doing things that basic bitches don’t do
Yeah I’m in love wit dollas (I’m in love wit dem dollas)
I’m in love wit dem dollas (I’m getting that money)
Money and power (money and power)
I’m in love wit dem dollas, dollas, dollas (I’m getting this money)
I’m in love with the dollas

[Verse 4]
You make me understand
You taught me how to be a man
I wish you’ll never go
And I just want you to know
You helped me see the man
Who taught me to be ‘bout paper
So I walked off and did my thing (I’m getting this money)
Came back a millionaire (Ben Franklin)


[Hook]
Band, frame, glutton
WHoa with them dollas, dollas
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
