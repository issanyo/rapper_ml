[Intro]
Say the law tryna pull me over (No Limit)
Tryna give me ticket
I ain’t pulling over
Tryna give me ticket

[Verse 1]
Sitting in my Lambo puffing on that fire
Never did change cause I’m all about that dollar
Full o’ riders and strapped with them riders
I’m bout to shoot down on your face like a shower
Boy you can say that you’re on top, I’m higher
I’d rather be a pigeon to a duck cause I’m flying
Get money all day nigga never get tired
A real ghetto superstar, ask that bitch Mya
I sell Mr. Wheeze like school
Ya’ll niggas ain’t shit to me but doop
My rich game stupid, I call it retarded
Rewind it, reverse it, back it up then start it
Players at the party, the sun shining on me
Rest in peace Kurt, kinda miss my homie
I don’t eat balogna, I fuck with macaroni
And fuck a bad bitch No Limit we the only

[Verse 2]
Sipping on Ciroc bottles
Shoot videos, fucking all the top models
Man fuck that Twitter cause my fans rarely follow
They be knocking on my door tryna get up my condo
Yeah got a nigga feeling like Rondo
A kid in my day said I am his role model
Got a ticket out the hood but I ain’t never win the Lotto
I’m too young to have kids so I make that bitch swallow

They say money isn’t everything
And having everything isn’t everything

Chopper on the shelf, greased up with one already in it
Ready to end it, finger fuck her till she finish
Middle finger start fucking niggas like prison yeah
