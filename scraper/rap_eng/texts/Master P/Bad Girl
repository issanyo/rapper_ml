[Hook]
Believe when I say
You say that you love me
You say that you need me
You say we were hunnid
Why the fuck I believe you?
I thought I was your man, wasn’t used to them games
I couldn’t explain, you couldn’t understand my love
Believe when I say
You say that you love me
You say that you need me
You say we were hunnid
Why the fuck I believe you?
I got this so real, could you measure how I feel
Let me be for real, you wouldn’t understand my love
My love, my love, my love
My love, my love, my love

[Verse 1]
Never mix business with pleasure
Did whatever to catch her
Now that I got you, I wish I never had met you
You went from nothing to something
When I met you, you had nothing
You bossed up with me now bitch you faking and stuntin
You been talking with bitches, you run your mouth with that nigga
You a snake that stay creeping, now all these lies and admission
Now you fucking with dummies, when you with me you had money
Look in your eyes see you lying, you want me back then keep trying

[Hook]
You say that you love me
You say that you need me
You say we were hunnid
Why the fuck I believe you?
I thought I was your man, wasn’t used to them games
I couldn’t explain, you couldn’t understand my love
Believe when I say
You say that you love me
You say that you need me
You say we were hunnid
Why the fuck I believe you?
I got this so real, could you measure how I feel
Let me be for real, you wouldn’t understand my love

[Verse 2]
She say she love me, she never place one above me
She claim she wanna fuck me, we smoking and sipping bubbly aye
She say she faithful, she vibing and she ain’t cheating
She tried it, she here cause strippers and DJ’s rep get that pussy excited
I hope these hoes get they issue, gold digging bitches ain’t royal
Don’t put your faith in these thots bro, I swear they ain’t loyal
I thought you said it was cracking, popping let’s skip a step
What you thought? I’m bout that life only when I’m paying the rent

[Hook]
You say, you say
You say that you love me
You say that you need me
You say we were hunnid
Why the fuck I believe you?
I thought I was your man, wasn’t used to them games
I couldn’t explain, you couldn’t understand my love
Believe when I say
You say that you love me
You say that you need me
You say we were hunnid
Why the fuck I believe you?
I thought this so real, could you measure how I feel
Let me be for real, you wouldn’t understand my love

[Verse 3]
She had me outta my mind like she couldn’t do wrong in my eyes
I was blinded by her appearance, the negro looked desirable
Cause a hoe was under construction
Her foundation was crumbling
But I’m glad the time was busted
Cause if it wasn’t, was fucking
And after fucking was fussing, she fussing
I cuff her then she love me
This bitch is crazy, her pussy also is being destructive
Lord I fell in love with a traitorous bitch
But I can’t lie, she know how to work that thing

[Hook]
You say that you love me
You say that you need me
You say we were hunnid
Why the fuck I believe you?
I thought I was your man, wasn’t used to them games
I couldn’t explain, you couldn’t understand my love
Believe when I say
You say that you love me
You say that you need me
You say we were hunnid
Why the fuck I believe you?
I thought this so real, could you measure how I feel
Let me be for real, you wouldn’t understand my love
My love, my love, my love
My love, my love, my love
