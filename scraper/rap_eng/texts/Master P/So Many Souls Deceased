OK you wanna go to war with me
I take you to war
I told you I don't kill no mothafucking kid
Look at you now you stupid fuck you stupid fuck

Chorus (2x):

I done seen so many souls deceased
That's why I ride with a lot of killers with me

Master P:

The Last Don be my name I feel I'm trapped in the game A lot of shit been changed to protect the guilty in the dope game
Judges getting paid nigga, turning to the feds nigga
Its a risky business the mob putting horse heads in niggas beds nigga
And homies going sour take 'em to the pen and they cowards
I'm not Scarface, but after the money and the power
And ask yourself who's the realest nigga you know
And if you ask me it be some niggas out the Cali yo
Like Glenn Miss, Sam Scuddy, Pee-Wee
L. Broadnax, Slim some dead some in jail g
Cause this game is so real
And niggas hustle like the Last Don 'til they get killed

Talking part

Chorus (4x)
The Commision #1:

Syndicated crime at its finest, started off dimeless
I bless the mic device and now my ice got you blinded
I stung the liquor so don't think this shit is a gimmick
The Last Don and The Commission T-S-O click and No Limit
From start to the finish for this paper look I'm all in it
Rules in the game I bend it in a tank that can't be dented
Drama we always in it cause many niggas be Ph'n
Mad that's why they busting they ass we on vacation
The unexpected done happened nigga we blowing up
Soundtracks and platinum plaques whodi there ain't no holding us
Give a fuck if ya like me care less if you don't
Bitch respect the flame in the tank making this bitch jump

Chorus (4x)

The Commision #2:

The shit about to start we living life
Like malt liquors in and out of court niggas
The Commission on a money making position a team of street smart niggas
Living this triple beam dream
Godfather bless a nigga with weight
Now we havin' ok receiving shipments in by the crates
Its that organized wise guy goodfella shit
The other level living like better shit
They crime family can barely ride hustling to gather shit
Ain't nobody separates Spiral and No Limit
The Last Don and the Commission in this money making position

The Commision #3:

I put 4-5 slugs in niggas neck no disrespect another casualty
I live my life jaggedly and carry myself savagely
Boy ya'll ain't fucking with no run of the mill niggas hoss
We kill niggas 357 steel nigga  by my waist under my Hilfigger
I'm trying to make a multimillion come up before I'm dead
A twisted No Limit wanted soldiers so holler when ya listening
I put it on these dreads in my head the Commission can't be faded
With the Last Don up in my corner its a sign the nigga made it

Chorus (2x)
