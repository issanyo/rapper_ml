And runnin' game like a choo-choo train
I got chicketts, seventeen for five, I'm the man
And them haters still hate me
One time on the grill but the rollers can't take P
My little brother told me watch my back
When I'm rollin' black
(Why?)
Cuz Down South they quick to pull a jack
But No Limit soldiers swell like B-12
And life in the ghetto I mean is a livin' Hell
So call us gangsters, keep one up in the chamber
Big man got that Tec-9 and V, will strangle ya
