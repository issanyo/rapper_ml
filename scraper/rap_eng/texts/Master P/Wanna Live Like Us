[Krazy] Do you ride what we ride touch what we touch
[Master P] How many young niggas out there wanna live like us



[Verse 1: Master P]

Call me hog head cause I love the cheese
Purple Juice In my cup nigga we love the weed
Send the word to the pen you felix the cat you was a man
When you went in and you was a bitch when you came back
In the new scoupe rims still spinnin I represent this bitch
The new no limit two-way me whodi I gets wit ya we high tech
Got phones that take pictures fuck wit ghetto bitches
Wit gold teeth wit tattoos rollin on shaq size 24 shoes I'm
A legend in the hood that crown me ghetto bill the only nigga in forbes with fuckin gold grill

(Hook)
