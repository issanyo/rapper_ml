My rap style is kill kill, never forget that
See the wig, you split that, you get that, it's that simple
Talk is cheaper then generic goods
We deadly apostiles, that means respected in every hood
The realest niggas be the illest niggas, he who whispers in the dark
You can see the black in my heart
But that tigers in my eyes when I come through, fuck what you been through
It's bout what you gone do when it come to
You ever dance with the devil cause we can take it to that level
I'm talking ghetto to ghetto just to catch you and wet you
Bless the soul of any nigga I cross
Somewhere in the shuffle we was lost looking for drama at any cost
Love changes, niggas is cut throat, especially when they snort coke
Mac's a minister, I was sent to replenish ya
Nothin can come between us, niggas who try to see us
Probably thanking me for sending them to meet they Jesus

[Mac/(Skull Duggery)]

Every dope dealer, every dope spot, from the Calliope to your block
I know why y'all bitches mad at us cause No Limit still hot
