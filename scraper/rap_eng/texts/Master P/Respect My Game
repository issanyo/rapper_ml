No matter what you do my nigga, it's not gon' be enough
You tryin to feed motherfuckers that'll always be hongry
You feed the wrong motherfucker they gon' bite you
But you know what?  If you real then you real
If you respect the game niggas gon' respect you
But if you fake, niggas gon' play you like a bitch

[Chorus: Master P - repeat 4X]
This for them thugs on the block tryin to hustle dawg
This for them girls in the game, holla break it off

[Master P]
Most niggas want to pitch and hide
I'm so gutter, so gangster when I spit these rhymes
I feel like I just did a bid
Nigga ten years later I still got these kids
Most niggas ain't keepin it real
Ghetto Bill showed these clowns how to get these deals
Jump off the porch and slang that rock
Represent the South then, made that pop
And y'all niggas ain't rememberin me?
Then, y'all niggas must not be from the streets
Cause my shit been in every car and every Jeep
From the South to the West to the motherfuckin East
I got real gangsters ready to ride
I got real killers ready to die
All my gangsters throw y'all hands up high
And y'all fake niggas run and hide - ya heard me?

[Chorus]

[Master P]
From the 'lliope to the Ville my nigga
Keep touchdown on the Benz say they ready for that grill
The New No Limit got the block on hot
And every thug in the hood screamin "We all we got"
Nigga it was a movement when we made it
How you not gon' respect what came before you
- that's how you gon' play it?
I taught the South how to flip them thangs
It took a nigga from the West to put y'all up on game
It took a nigga from Compton to scream my name
When I've been handin shit down since the "Ice Cream Man"
Hair nappy and twisted, I'm still thuggin
Straight from the hood, they still love it
And you boys ain't got to give me props
But I done taught you more than yo' pops - ya heard me?
The New No Limit man we can't be stopped
We brought the Dirty from the bottom to the motherfuckin top

[Chorus] - to fade
