[Master P talking]
Yo T, I know you there girl pick up the phone
Anyway, I'm on my way ya heard me

[Tamar Braxton & (Master P)]
I been watching you, watching me (I got my eyes on you too whodi, ha ha)
And I really want to know (I wanna make ya my babooski, ya heard)
Before we go, can you keep it on the low

[Tamar Braxton x2]
Tell me can you keep a secret
Tell me boy exactly what you do
Before I make you my boo or get freaky with you

[Master P]
What, what, what, what
The first time I seen you I met you in a party
Something about them eyes and the way you walk
It's something about them thighs and the way you talk
Make me wanna grab my pistol and go to war
I'm a thug but it's all love baby
Don't be scared, I'm not gon' break ya heart baby
Picture this a lil' sexin' on the beach, ya heard
Ya ready freaky when ya doin' this with me whodi
You like rides then I got plenty of dogs
You wanna go fast then boo I got exotic cars
You wanna be platinum then girl I'm gon' ice you up
And if the Benx too small take a Rolls or truck, ya heard

[Tamar Braxton & (Master P)]
I been watching you, watching me
(My life is my life, ya life is ya life)
(Ya see two wrongs can't make it two rights)
And I really want to know
(My life is my life, ya life is ya life)
(Ya see two wrongs can't make it two rights)
Before we go, can you keep it on the low

[Tamar Braxton x2]
Tell me can you keep a secret
Tell me boy exactly what you do
Before I make you my boo or get freaky with you

[Master P]
I don't mean to brag but if ya need some money boo I got that
10 karats on ya finger I bet cha' girl ya got that
Ya gotta play it safe whodi, I ain't gon' sweat chu'
Ya like to get freaky, tonight I'm gon' wet chu'
Champagne mix it up, hook it up with the bubble bath
Throw it to the hot tub, dresser, stab
Don't play no games whodi, then we can rock that
That new Jag truck you wanted boo you got that
I'm gon' be there for ya shorty but not trickin'
It's all love a lil' thuggin' and huggin' and kissin'
Toni Braxton says they wasn't man enough
But I'm a soldier girl so is it cool or what

[Tamar Braxton & (Master P)]
I been watching you, watching me
(My life is my life, ya life is ya life)
(Ya see two wrongs can't make it two rights)
And I really want to know

Before we go, can you keep it on the low

[Tamar Braxton]

Before I make you my boo or get freaky with you
