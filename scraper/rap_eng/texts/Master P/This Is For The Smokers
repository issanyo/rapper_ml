[Talking]
Somebody open a fuckin' window
I can't fucking breath

Let's get high tonight
Let's get high tonight
Let's get high tonight
Let's get high tonight

When I ain't got no weed my nerves get bad
This gunnu want a page 'bout to score me a bag
Of that green sticky, don't want no stems or seeds
My nigga Fiend in the front seat rollin' sum Sweets
See we like to get high Seven days a week
And weed smoke in the air, make my niggas tweak
And Snoop choppin' up some chronic in the back seat
Soulja Slim down to smoke 10 before we fall asleep
Get weight, and still wanna get high
Moby Dick commin' with that chocolate Tai

Nah, nah, this is for my smokers
My coke lovin' snorters
My niggas flippin' quarters
Uhh we smokers, we oughta
Nah, nah, this is for my smokers
My coke lovin' snorters
The niggas stay flippin' quarters
We smoke, cus we oughta

Two things I'm gun' do, get high and die
Shirt smellin' like sess, momma askin' why
Red eyes, burnt lips, brown finger tips
You chokin' like you 'bout to die, lemme hit that shit
I need weed to proceed, you hoes acting stuck up
But bitch I want some pussy, when we get fucked up
Just me and my niggas gettin' higha than a motherfucka
Stop at the store, mouth drya than a mothafucka
Half of pound of stress, put that chest to the test
Throw your nigga a gun, cus tonight's the smoke fest

Why, why this is for my smokers
My coke lovin' snorters
My niggas stay flippin' quarters
Uhh we smokers, we oughta
Uhh, uhh, this is for my smokers
My coke lovin' snorters
My niggas stay flippin' quarters
We smoke, cus we oughta
