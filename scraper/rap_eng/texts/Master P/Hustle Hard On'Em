[Verse 1:]
These n*ggas out here chasing hoes
I’m chasing money and getting paid
But n*gga mad at me cuz I’m shining
Pussy ass n*gga talking that shit
N*gga do you
I don’t never hit on no n*gga, I just hustle all day 24/7
Started from the bottom
N*gga don’t sleep
Hustle hard on these mother fucking streets
N*gga don’t hustle, then the n*gga don’t eat
How you gonna get money if all you do is fucking sleep
N*gga hustle hard on ‘em, hard on ‘em
Just made a hunned large on them, large on them
Cuz a n*gga hustle hard on ‘em, hard on ‘em
Money Mafia hustling
Pay for right bitches
Shit, that n*gga started with 20 dollars in a fucking flipper
Bet my first pullover n*gga honey fucking dripping
N*gga put it in the water watch that mother fucker swim
My tongue is green and gold n*gga called it Sean Kemp
Yes bro my old man told to get a fucking shirt
Got a hunned large out a mother fucking skirt
N*ggas playing games, I’m surrounded by shooters
Just sold me a big body Drake and the Medusa, oh shit

[Chorus:]
Started at the bottom
N*gga don’t sleep
Hustle hard on these mother fucking streets
N*gga don’t hustle, then the n*gga don’t eat
How you gonna get money if all you do is fucking sleep
N*gga hustle hard on ‘em, hard on ‘em
Just made a hunned large on them, large on them
Cuz a n*gga hustle hard on ‘em, hard on ‘em
Pay for right bitches
Hard on ‘em, hard on ‘em

[Verse 2:]
Listen, I started from the bottom
I’m wielding from the gutter
Me and my mother, my 3 sisters and my little brother
My daddy ran off, left us abandoned
I was 12 years old, couldn’t really understand it
But I paid attention, I used to watch him though
When he was in the kitchen, whipping up that dope
So when he left I knew we wasn’t gonna be broke
I’m just a young n*gga, I’ve been up off the porch

[Chorus]

[Outro:]
I hustle hard on ’em
I’ve been doing this shit for a long time
Always alert, and hear the licks and ducking one time
Now you trying with a n*gga like me breeze
Ratted up, tatted up, n*gga both sleeves
[?]
Counting money all fucking week
And my team, we solid like [?]
N*gga don’t sleep
Hustle hard on these mother fucking streets
N*gga don’t hustle, then the n*gga don’t eat
How you gonna get money if all you do is fucking sleep
N*gga hustle hard on ‘em, hard on ‘em
Just made a hunned large on them, large on them
Cuz a n*gga hustle hard on ‘em, hard on ‘em
I pay for right bitches
Hard on em, hard on em
