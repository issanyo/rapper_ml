{Master P prays in the background}
Our father, who art in heaven
Hallowed be thy name
Thy kingdom come, thy will be done
On earth, as it is in heaven

{spoken over prayer}
Hail Mary (Hail Mary) Hail Mary (Hail Mary)
Hail Mary (Hail Mary) Hail Mary..
Hail Mary..
Hail Mary (Hail Mary) Hail Mary..

{singing part comes in} + {Hail Mary spoken over}
Now I lay me down to sleep..
I pray the Lord.. my soul to keep..
And if I die before I wake..
I pray the Lord.. my soul to take..

(UNGGGGGGGGGGGHHHHH)

[Master P]
Did I live my life as a killer, did I grow up with the thugs?
See I coulda been a doctor, instead I sold drugs
My best partner was bloated, probably live if he wasn't loaded
I got so many questions Lord, that's why I told it
That ida like mosquita, don't wanna be the beaver
But on judgement day, I know I wanna see ya
Momma pray for you baby {*echoes*}
See this ghetto got me crazy {*echoes*}
Lord help me don't slay me {*echoes*}
I'm just tryin to feed my babies {*echoes*}
In the world where it's phony, where your enemies be your homies
And Lord, won't ya be there when the Devil run up on me

{singing part comes in} + {Hail Mary spoken over}
Now I lay me down to sleep..
I pray the Lord.. my soul to keep..
And if I die before I wake..
I pray the Lord.. my soul to take..

[Magic]
Where do we go from here
Cause I want to walk this evil earth without a ounce of fear
Hopin that my time ain't near
Wishin that I'd NEVER seen my momma shed a tear
I've done so much wrong in my life, at night
I sleep with my eyes open, hopin
That the Reaper pass me by, I'm tryin to change
But my life's deranged
Jackin my own color for they rangs and change
Forgive me I was tryin to be a MAN
With this pistol in my hand
But took a forty-four, slug in my back
Just to make me understand (my Lord)
So can I still be an angel?
Or on judgement day, will you treat me like a stranger?

Now I lay me down to sleep..
I pray the Lord.. my soul to keep..
And if I die before I wake..
I pray the Lord.. my soul to take..

{singing part}
Now I lay me down to sleep..
I pray the Lord.. my soul to keep..
And if I die before I wake..
I pray the Lord.. my soul to take..
Now I lay me down to sleep..
I pray the Lord.. my soul to keep..
And if I die before I wake..
I pray the Lord.. my soul to take..
