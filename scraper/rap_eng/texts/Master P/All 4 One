See when i be sressing , mothefucker im trying to get it (trying to get it)
Pass me the motherfucking catchers mitt, I ain't no bullshittin
Do we got beef on the streets, nigga pass me the heat
It's time to pop some motherfucking necks and put these punks to sleep
I ain't playing with you bitch, Im just chasing million dollar dreams
Now the fedz trying to get me cooking keys up in the kitchen
Just a young nigga trying to make it out the bricks
I got medicine for the pigs, I mean 20 fuckin dollar hits
And when the game get me stressed out fuck it im ready to ride
Call up Prime Suspect cause somebody bout to die
And jump in the motherfucking car and pass the heat (pass the heat)
Everybody gone nigga, fuck the police
See niggas do any motherfucking thing when they broke
But I dont fuck with punk nigga and I dont smoke no dope
See I'm a killer by heart, a G by nature
Fuck these bitches cause they'll love ya, but most of these hoes they hate

I gots some cutthroat rhymes posted up uptown
Ain't no limit to the danger that be lurking around
But we ride in that night, but we might not make it back
Gunning from the killer corn, got the straps on the lap
Where the hustle, P and PS, got the muscle
Fuck the stuggle, couldn't get lost in the scuffle
Street walls forced apon ghetto children
Putting any section to sleep when a nigga got the heat

[Master P]
Fuck the world we gon ball til we fall
Soldiers, all for nigga, one for all
Fuck the world we gon ball til we fall
Soldiers, all for nigga, one for all

Fuck what you saying, see I'm down to do whatever
Bout it bout it, did you heard I'm bout my cheddar
Calliope now have your backup plan nigga now
Is you bout that drama, world that is stressed to hard, is a soldier thang
If a hustlers time to make bout to make it, take it out of loose change
And don't play me close fuck with mine and loose your brains
Hit you with them thangs

[New Nine]

TRU niggas jacking and stay strapped when they pockets flat
Rats take a dive, i told you these niggas live Glock

Been jacking, stying, cracking and capping ,whats happening
Now we still bout that dumb shit quicker than the change, because we rapping
