Who's gonna help the children
The ones without a roof?
Who's gonna help the orphans
The ones without any food?
Who's gonna stop the violence?
It starts with me and you
You could've warned me
Told me I would fall
I know you love me
Could've protected me from it all
But instead you let me fall apart
I watched the towers, collapsing
In this crazy world of ours
Crossing the bridge
While it's burning
So many lives torn apart
Stuck at the table
While it's turning
And we don't know where to go
We gotta change
Let's get it together
We could make it baby but we gotta change
Oh we gotta change
Once we get it together
We should promise eachother we'll never change
We gotta change
For the better, for the better baby
We gotta change
Just like the sun that comes and wastes the clouds away
Oh, we gotta change
Like the seasons
When autum turn into spring
Oh, we gotta change
When it's dark out
We know the sun will come and shine again
We gotta change
It's inevitable
As long as we give the world a change
We gotta change, we are the change
We gotta change, oh we gotta change
I see all the hatred and madness
Wish we could get rid of all these guns
Lives taken in Paris
I'm embarassed
Wish we could take back what was done
All of the racists and terrorists
When we really should be one
Supposed to serve and protect us
Not kill and neglect us
See us with our hands up
We gotta change
Let's get it together
We could make it baby but we gotta change
Oh we gotta change
Once we get it together
We should promise eachother we'll never change
We gotta change
For the better, for the better baby
We gotta change
Just like the sun that comes and washes the clouds away
We gotta change
Like the seasons
When autum turns into spring
Oh we gotta change
When it's dark out
We know the sun will come and shine again
We gotta change
It's inevitable
As long as we give the world a change
We gotta change, we are the change
We gotta change, oh we gotta change
Together we can change the world
