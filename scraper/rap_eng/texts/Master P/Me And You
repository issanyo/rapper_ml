Artist: Silkk The Shocker f/ Master P
Album:  Charge It 2 Da Game
Song:   Me And You

-Master P- (mumbling)

-Silkk-
Uuuuuuuuuuhhhh
Me and you together had plans on making the day, having cash
As time passed tryin' to make it all last
You know we struggle
Hope we can see better days
And the time different dreamers is to go our seperate ways

Verse 1 - Silkk

See you was always good
I was always bad
You was always in school
I was always to cuttin' class
Cheatin' on my tests knowin' I wouldn't pass
Told me slow down nigga I was movin' too fast
They always told me ???
I wish you well one day
If you could be spent up, shot at, get me out of jail some day
Yah, I was told to be like you
And at times I tried
Realized the only way I can beat these streets
The only way I knew to survive
I remember comin' home high and drunk
Smellin' just like a alcoholic
Tryin' to sneak you in
They damn near caught us
We be down to rock the block party's all night
Even thought we clown, we be down to fight, all night
Hangin' with the big homies
Askin' what they hittin' fo'
I remember stealin' junk food out the neighborhood liquor sto'
Sittin' back remeniscin' on all the things we had
Even thought it was rough, it never seemed so bad
Our destiny, we can't shape
I know we made mistakes
Even thought i wonder why He took you
I can't question fate
I guess it was written

-Master P-
But check it out
You still hear cuz you gon' live through me, C, and Silkk

Chorus: Silkk

Me and you I always thought we'd be together
I shoulda' known nuttin' last forever
And see I, destiny, we can't shape it
Even thought I wonder why we die
I can't question fate
Me and you I always thought we'd be together
I shoulda' known nuttin' last forever
And somehow I always thought you'd be there
Get a deg on the mark, it's cold, but it's fair

Verse 2 - Silkk

See man, right now I just gotta watch my step
No matter how many homies I lose
I can't get used to death
I remember us 5, runnin' wild
Just tryin' to get paid
It wouldn't seem like a jail
Put some rose on Dante's grave
(No reason you gon' die)
Gimme for thinkin' that
You were my brother
I'd pay millions to know I was safe
A million to bring ya back
Y'all my family, as well as my friends
And if I had to bring ya back that mean I havta lose ya again
Your memory's gonna live on even though ya' gon'
I'm sittin hear contemplating where it all went wrong
We had an argument, I said some things I shouldn'ta said
Never got a chance to apologize when you didn't come home that day
I'm thinkin' about memories every time I lay down
I wish I woulda known
I woulda apologized
But i guess I gotta say it now
So I see you when I get there
But for now I'ma pour out liquor
'Til i'm up there wishin'

Chorus x2.5

Silkk -

And if this song don't hit home
Picture the person you love the most
And, you wake up, they be gone

Master P -

Damn, Kevin Miller
See you when I get there fool
'Til then you gon' live on thru us
Huh, we riders baby, you know that
Down to handle our business
Silkk can handle his business
We 'bout it 'bout it, rowdy rowdy
Love nigga
