[Verse 1: Jussie Smollett]
People been talking about it
We won't just stand here in silence
Can't stop the fire from rising
From rising
Oh, oh

[Verse 2: Alicia Keys]
People don't you be afraid
So many innocent's slain
This is an era for change
Change

[Pre-Hook: Jussie Smollett & Alicia Keys]
And Malcolm's probably turning in his grave
Every shade was beautifully made

[Hook: Alicia Keys & Jussie Smollett]
And Powerful
There's so much strength in you and me
Powerful
A breath away from victory
I matter
You matter
We matter, All
I matter
You matter
We matter, All
Powerful, powerful

[Verse 3: Alicia Keys]
I see a colorful future
Where skin don't define any human
And stars are the only thing shootin'
Shootin', oh, oh

[Verse 4: Jussie Smollett]
Mothers that bury their child
How can we sit there and hide
Change comes when all take a stand
Now stand up, stand up

[Pre-Hook: Jussie Smollett & Alicia Keys]
Martin's speech still echoes in my brain
Every shade was beautifully made

[Hook : Alicia Keys & Jussie Smollett]
And Powerful
There's so much strength in you and me
Powerful
A breath away from victory
I matter
You matter
We matter, All
I matter
You matter
We matter, All
Powerful, powerful

[Bridge]
Oh Oh, Oh Oh, Oh.Oh
Oh Oh, Oh Oh, Oh.Oh
Oh Oh, Oh Oh, Oh.Oh

[Hook: Alicia Keys & Jussie Smollett]
Powerful
There's so much strength in you and me
Powerful
A breath away from victory
I matter
You matter
We matter, All
I matter
You matter
We matter, All
Powerful, powerful
