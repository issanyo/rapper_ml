[Chorus]
When I get grown, I'm gonna cherish that big house on the hill
But for now I'd like to chill here and keep it real
When I get grown, I'm gonna cherish that big house on the hill
But for now I'd like to chill here and keep it real
When I get grown, I'm gonna cherish that big house on the hill
But for now I'd like to chill here and keep it real

[Verse 1]
In ten years I can't believe man I'll be 20
Bought a couple cars livin large tryna put it in the picture
Cause my moms has been in it for years
And people sayin thats Little P handlin his business
I remember hangin on the block wit the boys
Goin to the dollar movies, me and V-played dodge the ball
We had fun even though times was hard
I mean me and Lance played Dreamcast
I can't believe my lil whodi lost his life in a car crash
One day you here then you gone ya heard me?

[Chorus]
When I Get Grown
I'm gonna cherish that
Big house on the hill
But for now I'd like to chill
Here and keep it real
When I Get Grown
I'm gonna cherish that
Big house on the hill
But for now I'd like to chill
Here and keep it real
When I Get Grown
I'm gonna cherish that
Big house on the hill
But for now I'd like to chill
Here and keep it real

[Verse 2]
Never say god can't you gotta have a plan
I thank moms and pops for raisin me man
I seen kids get shot and some go to jail
When you die lil whodi is it Heaven or Hell?
I wanna be like Mike I mean ball and make money
Keep it real wit my peeps and never act funny
I seen kids on drugs go to school and commit crimes
We use to fight each other but now its tecs and knifes
Stay in school get a job education it goes far
Man, it's gotta be more to life than just jewlery and cars

[Chorus]
When I get grown, I'm gonna cherish that big house on the hill
But for now I'd like to chill here and keep it real
When I get grown, I'm gonna cherish that big house on the hill
But for now I'd like to chill here and keep it real
When I get grown, I'm gonna cherish that big house on the hill
But for now I'd like to chill here and keep it real
When I get grown, I'm gonna cherish that big house on the hill
But for now I'd like to chill here and keep it real
When I get grown, I'm gonna cherish that big house on the hill
But for now I'd like to chill here and keep it real
When I get grown, I'm gonna cherish that big house on the hill
But for now I'd like to chill here and keep it real
When I get grown, I'm gonna cherish that big house on the hill
But for now I'd like to chill here and keep it real
When I get grown, I'm gonna cherish that big house on the hill
But for now I'd like to chill here and keep it real
When I get grown, I'm gonna cherish that big house on the hill
But for now I'd like to chill here and keep it real
