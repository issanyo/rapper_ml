[Intro: Master P]
Bitch, this P world here, bitch, ain't man except me
I ain't comin for no coffee beans, straight up coke and weed, bitch
Here go the money. You got da coke?
Here go da money. You got the coke?
I ain't comin' for no coffee beans, straight up coke and weed, bitch

[Verse 1: Master P]
Jumped in my Cutlass, rollin' on switches
Golds, they shinin' down south peelin' bitches
Niggas out that swamp, should I say New Orleans?
Richmond, California, imported me some dank weed
Rollin' on blunts, niggas call it Swisher sweets
I got birds 16-5 a muthafuckin ki
Fool, when ya hit me, it's 18-5
I gotta tax ya 2 G's just for takin' a ride
'Cause niggas down south, niggas ain't playin
Niggas talk shit, muthafuckas be layin'
Down on the ground, just like 8-ball
Hit you wit' yo' nuts and yo' G's up the bare wall
Push you behind a pistol in the block
Niggas slangin' ki's (*gunshots*) now somebody got shot
Call the cops, killas, I'm a dealer
Mr. Ice Cream Man, yo' neighborhood drug dealer
Nigga dat's bout it, down south we rowdy
From Atlanta to Texas, niggas won't y'all read about
Swamp Niggas comin up, blowin' like killa
Y'all ain't ready but I ain't Mystikal, I'm a dealer
Niggas slangin' 'caine, coca leaves up the brain
But it's a muthafuckin Third Ward, I mean a Swamp Thing

[Chorus]
Swamp Nigga (UHH), Swamp Nigga (UHH)
Swamp Nigga (UHH), Swamp Nigga (UHH)
Swamp Nigga (UHH), Swamp Nigga (UHH)
Swamp Nigga (UHH), Swamp Nigga

[Verse 2: Master P]
Hey, in the middle of the muthafuckin' south
Niggas got gold in they muthafuckin' mouth
On my way to Chicago, to pick up me a Stoeger
I ain't even trippin' off this shit 'cause I'm a rolla
Nigga ridin' dirty, just like UGK
Four TEC-9's and a muthafuckin' AK
Niggas ain't playin' down south, bitch, we bout it
I told y'all niggas in '96, yeah, don't y'all doubt it
But niggas play the ..., try to play us like some bitches
Niggas done snuck up on you hoes and snatched some riches
From labels like No Limit to Suave to Rap-a-Lot
Independent, black-owned, bitch, and we can't be stopped
Breakin' bread with the muthafuckin' ballers
Niggas checks Billboard, yeah, and we shot callers
Now y'all niggas mad 'cause a nigga famous
I think the president put a price on my anus
America's nightmare, but I'm not Cube
I represent the muthafuckin' red and the blue
Shoes, I mean, the bangas, the killas, the gangstas
But nigga I'm a Swamp, professional ghetto, rap slanga

[Chorus]
Swamp Nigga (UHH), Swamp Nigga (UHH)
Swamp Nigga (UHH), Swamp Nigga (UHH)
Swamp Nigga (UHH), Swamp Nigga (UHH)
Swamp Nigga (UHH), Swamp Nigga

[Verse 3: Master P]
Niggas in Texas, sippin' on syrup
Niggas sippin' barre, niggas on that furl
Niggas in Florida, sellin' dat water
Niggas in Baton Rouge pushin' dem quarters
All the way to Shreveport to muthafuckin' Mississippi
Oklahoma, back to Kansas City
5th wheel grill, niggas comin' down
Fools getting killed if they from outta town
Six 15's in the candy painted Cadillac
Bumpin' "Break 'Em Off" rollin' tips like a maniac
("Don't make me break you off somethin'")
Playas from the south stack muthafuckin' G's
("Playaz from the south stack G's")
I got Beats by the Pound, just like quarter ki's
KLC put it on the scale so y'all can feel it
Mo B. D put it in the bag so y'all can peel it
Craig B whipped it up with some B 12s
I slung it on the streets to make the muthafucka sell
Too $hort said fools, get in where ya fit in
That's why I'm a Swamp Nigga out there tryin' to pay the rent

[Chorus]
Swamp Nigga (UHH), Swamp Nigga (UHH)
Swamp Nigga (UHH), Swamp Nigga (UHH)
Swamp Nigga (UHH), Swamp Nigga (UHH)
Swamp Nigga (UHH), Swamp Nigga (UHH)

[Outro: Master P]
Swamp Nigga, ha, ha
We sho' from muthafuckin swamp
It ain't a East or West Coast thing, nigga
It's a swamp thing
Tru 2 da muthafuckin' game
To the South, Midwest, West Coast
And all cross the muthafuckin' world, Swamp Niggas
On the muthafuckin' rise
