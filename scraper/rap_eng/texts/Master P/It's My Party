[Verse 1:]
Tonight I just might blow a couple racks (if I want to)
Cause tomorrow I know I could make it back (if I want to)
Might take a trip around the city, shut it down
I’m known to stop and throw a party wherever I’m at (if I want to)
I said I might turn up the music til' it slaps (if I want to)
But if I really wanna turn up to the max (if I want to)
Might go and grab a lil' something and while we doin' a hundred
Drop the top just, just to see how they react (if I want to)

[Bridge:]
Catch me, catch me in the club, in V.I.P
Turnt up, doing me
So we gon' party while we young
We might as well have some fun
So don’t waste nun of your time
Cause I’m gon' do just what I want

[Hook:]
It’s my party, I turn up if I want to
Turn up if I want to, turn up if I want to
It’s my body, I get loud if I want to
Wild out if I want to, I do what I want to
So if you real and you know it you could bring a friend
If you ain’t on what I’m on you ain’t getting in
(I'm saying) It’s my party, I turn up if I want to
Turn up if I want to, turn up if I want to

[Verse 2:]
So baby if you really came to dance (if I want to)
Then take it to the floor, this is your chance (if I want to)
See it’s my life so I do me
If I really want it I stop the music
And make everyone put up their hands (if I want to)
See I throw stacks out if I wanna
Cash out if I wanna
We show up, we shut it down
All eyes be on us
Keeping on living it up, tell the DJ turn it up
Ain’t no stopping what we doin' cause we all the way turnt up

[Bridge]

[Hook]

[Verse 3:] [x2]
You would turn up too if you could do what I ... (x2)
You would turn up too if you could do what I do

[Hook]
