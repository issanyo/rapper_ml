Posted on the block getting paid with the locs up
Everybody in the hood just as smoked up
So I just walk with my locs on, and get my motherfucking
Set get it going on, in other words I see a fiend in the
Motherfucking park, you know im serving em in the dark
But I dont cause I pack a fuvking dis 9, you know the
God damn turf is all mine sometime niggas hall in the streets
But I dont run from the po po police
I got fiends in the back instead of the front, Im selling
20's and dimes and even crum and motherfuckers better low
Cause I gotta get it, I got a 9 motherfuckers so deal with it
And get a beat from a fiend everytime I wear a bulletproof
Vest so nigga go up in it, and I dont give a fuck
If niggas can't stand me, Im on the turf motherfucker
Selling candy

[Chorus]
I got candy, crack cocaine
Hold them thangs in my hand cause I'm the dope dope man
I got candy, crack cocaine
Hold them thangs in my hand cause I'm the dope dope man


I see tweakers when I walk chase a nigga through the park
Grab my fucking 9 and keep them dope fiends in line

*Chorus til' end*
