[Master P] (Mack 10)
Third ward, New Orleans. To Inglewood
To the motherfuckin world, nigga
Mack Dime. (What's up my nigga?)
Mystikal, and Master P
(They know, P, they know, they know.)

[Hook:] (Master P & Mack 10) X 6
Made niggas from the South to the West!

[Master P]
Give me a chance to ball, put my name on the wall
How many killas done called, No Limit niggas stand tall
Cuz we, mercenary soldiers, gone off a Hennesy and that doja
Runnin from the, (Who?) motherfuckin rollers
Slangin, (What?) tapes like cola
Nigga, hangin with the big niggas
Penitentiary chances just to make six figures
No we fuckin (What?) gold and platinum
Nigga, we made niggas and we rappin
Nigga, Mack Dime, Mystikal and P
Every rowdy bout it nigga won't you follow me?

[Hook] X 4

[Mystikal]
Watch me! I'm throwed off, I ain't right!
Bitch I'll do you somethin, I ain't wrapped tight!
I roll with bullets like (?) and killas like Versey
Managed by TC and paid by big Percy
Whole lotta niggas with me
You think I'm lying, but I'm not
You know who we are, we ready for war
You ready to die fuckin with the wide Tchoupitoulas
Say your prayers, them niggas shottin, Hallelujah!
Gotta stop these niggas from runnin they dick lickers
We self made big niggas, killin these bitch niggas
We paper chasin, goin platinum, in the gangstafied fashion
Made niggas from the south to the west done hooked up with Mack 10
Gotta get real with this shit that's the only way shit gon happen
We made now, we was gangstas back then!

[Hook] X 4

[Mack 10]
From Inglewood to the NO, Mystikal, Mack and
P
No Limit soldiers, Hoo Bangin see we got the Recipe
I stay ready nigga, with a vest strapped and all
Hit the rizzo and ball from LA to the Mardi Gras
No discrimination, hittin blacks to amigos
Slangin compact discs like they kilos
A real hustler, recognize another nigga with scrilla
Game recognize game, and killas recognize killas
Never aim to loose, always wanna be a winner
Transactions in New Orleans over jambalaya dinner
Cuz what you say you want, that's it, that's what you get, you
Can't switch
Cuz Silkk'll shock you nigga, and make Mia shoot your bitch
We tatted up, bauggeted up, the jewels glare
Make the haters stop and stay "How we do that there?"
See Mack and Master P, been up to seven figures
Hoo Bangin and No Limit, two sets of made niggas

[Hook] (till fade)
