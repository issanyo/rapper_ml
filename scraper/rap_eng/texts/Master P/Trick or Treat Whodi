{*woman SCREAMING*}

[Master P]
Guess who's back.. it's Freddy?  NAH, P BITCH!
WHASSSSSSUP?  Ah-HAHAHAHAHA

[Chorus: repeat 2X]
Trick or treat whodi.. where you be whodi?
I'm right 'cross the street whodi
And I think I seen the beast whodi!

[Master P]
It must be Halloween, ya heard me?  It all happened at once
I'm in the middle of the hood rollin a black and orange blunt
My mind fucked up, I done seen a black cat {*ROWR!*}
Put my hand on my gat and took three steps back
Ran up the block it was like a movie
I seen a big haunted house with a chick in a jacuzzi
I knocked on the doors {*DING-DONG*} and it broke the mirror {*CRASH*}
I got seven days of bad luck and a dog with no liver(??)
It must be a nightmare, but I'm bout to wake up
Then I put my nail in the keyhole {*door*} and jumped in the truck
{*engine revs*} Headed to the club, the party's off the hook
Until I ran into this nigga that I knew was a crook
He said... onnnnne, twoooooo... they comin for you
Threeee, fourrrrr... better lock your door {*animal roars*}
Nah, fuck the world, I'm about to go for mines
Cause I'm trapped in this dream like I'm trapped in crime
I see this younger ??, hair looked just like Eve
And I'm thinkin to myself, what the fuck is she doin in New Orleans?
Now is this a curse, or shit I did bad
Or my mind playin tricks cause I snatched a kid's bag

[Chorus]

[Slay Sean]
Yeah it's nighttime, the right time to do crime
Niggas hustle, and watch out for po'-nine
It's showtime, raisin hell {*ROAR!*} one more time
Thugs move, no rules bottom line
You got into the sunset to speak your mind {*SCREE!*}
Run - lock your doors, the streets is mine
Niggas wild out, {*SCREE!*} throw eggs, the people beg
October 31st niggas need to be caged
No remorse {*SCREE!*} you done heard my force
Takin, what we want, by means of all sorts
It's the way of life, payback's a bitch, pay the price
Somebody gotta suffer, even po-lice
When the streets is dark and cold you fear for your life
You know you hear the screams {*SCREAM*} it's a horrible sight
Nobody fiends, they just wanna survive the night
Twelve hours of mayhem as you beg for life

[Chorus]

[Master P]
Trick or TREAT, kiddies!
Bout to deliver the mail once again
"Ghetto Postage," all platinum BITCH!

I TOLD Y'ALL EVERYBODY
Y'ALL CAN'T FUCK WITH NO LIMIT (hahahaha)
Who's laughin now, WHODI?  Hehehehe, trick or treat!

Junebug, you better take that mask off
And get your little bitch-ass inside!
