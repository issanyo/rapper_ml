[Chorus- BlaqNmilD)]
Since I moved out the hood to Hollywood
People tell me I mack in Hollywood
But I still remember where I came from nigga
My city had my back and that's from day one nigga
Funny how money have niggas change on niggas
So when you see me I'm with my day one niggas
Talkin' No Limit to the grave my nigga
To the grave my nigga
(Cartharsis)
Since I moved out the hood into Hollywood
People tellin' you get into Hollywood
But I still remember where I come from nigga (wit' my day one nigga)
T-T-Talkin' No Limit to the grave my nigga

[Verse 1- Romeo Miller]
My day one nigga, fuckin' locked up
And I'm out here livin' life tho
Head to the sky, like low, this shit fucked up
They got my day one nigga doin' life doe
I swear to God that's why I gotta make a billi
Fuck a Grammy, your favorite rapper deserve to win an Emmy
These nigga pullin' no chains will even ride for they team
My soldiers will take a bullet, yours won't even give a kidney
I rep New Orleans all day my nigga
My team strong but pit to the Bay my nigga
I ain't gotta pay security that's free my nigga
No Limit to the grave, that's on P my nigga
