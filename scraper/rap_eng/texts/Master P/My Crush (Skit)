Man,life has been so good since romeo came back
I tried to tell mommy the truth but would she listen
Nawww you so lucky joyce he was right there
In front of you and on top of that he looked right at you

(second girl:)
If romeo even just looked at me like he looked at you
Id just scream i could talk about him all day
He's fine he's talented he's fine he fine
I wishe i could make him mine
