Yo los, take us to a commercial
While we stop to get high
Y'all check out the young guns, ya heard me?

Check this out..
If you have four ounces and you fronted your boy two
And he gave a half to his boy
And the police raided the spot then he flushed one and a half
And he ask you for one mo'
What should you do if you was in that position?

[young guns]
Nigga f**k that! I ain't bout to let the shit slide
It's time to ride, time for these niggas to die
We don't just rap - everything we say is for real
Time to let the gauge discharge, and murder that kill
Nigga f**k that! I ain't bout to let the shit slide
It's time to ride, time for these niggas to die
We don't just rap - everything we say is for real
Time to let the gauge discharge, and murder that kill

Tell them bitch niggas - they can keep from around
This is family now, I give a f**k about you clowns
Young guns holdin it down, quick to bust a few rounds
? ? our sound, tell my niggas and my bitches
They'll drop in the storm, tell them boys it's on
And these niggas gettin they ass torn, f**k bein warned
This is a street ? ? , I promise to die violent
Now I start wildin, until you bitch niggas are silent

Nigga f**k that! I'm bout to send these niggas life back

They talkin shit about my fam and I don't like that
You know how I react, so why you wanna beef?
It's time for me to say my prayers, and hit the streets
Bullets about to hum, bitch niggas gon' get numb
Here come ? ? down the block nigga don't try to run
I ain't lettin it slide I caught him slippin and him twice
Next thing you that nigga was on the ground, shakin like dice

These niggas fail the test so neverthless I split yo' chest
F**k the rest!
I come through to spit, to show you niggas what I manifest
A y.g., so I breathe toke three, ? ?
Bullets at you busters please, don't try to test these
Pistol packin niggas in our town
You get them hot thangs laid in your mouth
My niggas seek you out no doubt
All about my salary you niggas ain't gon' handle me
I'm tired of stressin, and all these niggas pretend they got me vexed
