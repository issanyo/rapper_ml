[Mr. Marcelo]
For them hoes, for them hoes
For them hoes, for them hoes
Get with it....

Fatal, you ride me it's touching your navel
You ain't never been touched by a tough guy cable
Monkey on this, come and act a donkey on this
Pussy break better be bigger than a catcher's mitt
Get fucked up in the club and I'm taking your home
If that ass look petique then I'm breaking some bones
Well if it's on, it's on, baby bring some friends
We can all get butt-naked in the Holiday Inn
How you like it?, from the front, from the back, oh you like to ride?
It don't matter baby you can decide

Chorus: [Mr. Marcelo]

How you like it baby?, from the front,  from the back
From the side, smack it, and hit it all night (Like that!)
How you like it baby?, from the front,  from the back
From the side, smack it, and hit it all night (Like that!)
How you like it baby?, from the front,  from the back
From the side, smack it, and hit it all night (Like that!)
How you like it baby?, from the front,  from the back
From the side, smack it, and hit it all night (Like that!)

[Mr. Marcelo]
On the outside of the club, seven hoes in line
When I walk in the club, seven hoes on wine
Finna take seven more before I spit my rhymes
Now that's 21 hoes done at the same time

[Master P]
She looked at my hands and my feet and said you working with something
A couple of bottles of that bubbley and I'ma be twerking with something
I like a project model, big booty and gold teeth
Now if she a Hot Girl she ain't rollin' with me
I love them thug girls, the kind that be on Jerry Springer
Fight for her man just like a gang banger
Cheefin' with her friends, never messin with the men
Roll in a big body benz, and never stunt or pretend
Ya heard me?

Chorus: [Mr. Marcelo]

How you like it baby?, from the front, to the back
From the side, smack it, and hit it all night (Like that!)
How you like it baby?, from the front, to the back
From the side, smack it, and hit it all night (Like that!)
How you like it baby?, from the front, to the back
From the side, smack it, and hit it all night (Like that!)
How you like it baby?, from the front, to the back
From the side, smack it, and hit it all night (Like that!)
How you like it baby?

[Mr. Marcelo]
Hit it all night (Florida), hit it all night (Georgia)
I could hit it all night
How you like it? I could hit it all night (Texas)
From the front, to the back
To the side, hit it all night (Philly)
From the front, to the back
To the side, hit it all night (Mississippi)
