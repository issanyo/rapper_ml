[Intro: O'Dell]
I remember when we were kids
We shed all our hurt and tears (and tears)
No matter what the weather, what the weather
We were always together (always together)
We grew up as time went on
We became seperated (seperated)

[Chorus: repeat 2X]
It was a sad day (it was a sad day)
When my homie went away (when my homie went away)
It was a sad day (it was a sad day)
When Kevin went away (when Kevin went away)

[Master P]
Kevin, life ain't the same, even though we got some change
See momma dont understand how you died in the game
And grandma get older, Little Kevin he is a soldier
We done made it out da ghetto ain't no more run'n for the rollers
Tattooed your face on my arm so you legacy could live on
You said "P be strong" without you we all alone
I know it's been a few years, on your birthday we shed tears
And I don't wanna question God
But why he took you and left us here?

[Chorus]

[Silkk the Shocker]
Look - just thinkin about you my nigga bring tears to my eyes
I mean I'm hard and all but even the realest niggas cry
And when you left,  part of me died too
And who ever knew Kevin like I knew Kevin  shhh  ya'll would cry too
Just think'n about you, if you were still here
How much different remenisin on one of your pictures
Lookin at the family  thinkin we always got one miss'n
And I can still remember the last words (and mine ain't even started)
Look your never forgotton cuz on your birthday I go and put flowers on your grave
I still remember when P and C broke the news to me at school about your death
Told me "Silkk time would heal our wounds"
Its been oh five years and I ain't healed yet
Now I feel somthing I'm tryin tryin to be strong
I know moms tryin to hold on
Even tho your here and your gone
I got so many questions, thats why I can't move on
(Its somthing about you)

[Chorus]

[C-Murder]
Now as I could remember (remember)
A couple of months before December (December)
I still can't take the pain
We all are stuck in this ghetto rain
I learned my lesson,  could your blessings
Watch your enemys and watch your friends
And if it ain't your blood dont show that man no love
Cuz kindness make you weak and cause blindness in the streets
And the vultures commin to get you
When none of ur real homies is wit ya
And its sad  can't break the cycle
And take a drink wit my uncle Michael
And my momma question my silence
But I blame this sinceless violence
Don't wanna wake up cuz when imma asleep
You still alive up in my dreams
A few seconds of happy thoughts to keep my mind at eaze
And then Kevin its like you ghost my body freeze when ever I see him
If anybody got yours ways, you know it'd be him

[Chorus]
