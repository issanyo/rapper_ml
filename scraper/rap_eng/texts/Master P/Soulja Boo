I gotta couple diamonds with a mouth fulla gold
Platinum on the wrist, Bentley in the dri-i-i-ve

And all my souljas rest, raise ya hands up high

Take you out the ghetto and then I'll treat ya

Hit me on the cell or on the beepa
Roll a 600 Benz to the spot I'ma freak ya
Then pick a hotel that me and you can creep too

A fire boy with 20'z on his car
When I need some love he won't be far
