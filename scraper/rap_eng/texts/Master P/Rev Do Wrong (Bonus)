[(Master P) + Rev. Do Wrong]
(Yeah, you know we couldn’t do this without Reverend Do Wrong)
Yes…
(Everybody stand up and clap for Reverend Do Wrong)
To all you dick suc—I mean, bird lickers, player haters
Pickpocketers, robbers and jackers, and gold-diggers
(And don’t forget about them prostitutes)
I wanna share a small, brief story with you…
(Share it with me, Rev.)
…about Sister Betty
(Oh yeah, I know that bitch)
Sister Betty came to me…
(What she say?)
…with a little skirt on
She said, “Reverend Do Wrong, can you help me?”
(Can you help?)
I said, ‘What you need, Sister Betty?’
She said, “Little Leroy needed a little pair of shoes”
(A little pair of shoes)
I said, ‘Sister Betty, if you return a favor to me, and I give a favor to you
Like they say in street bible, we can help each other”
So Sister Betty did me, I didn’t do her, the story is told
(There you go, there you go, that’s a real G)
And for all you suckers who wanna say something about my congregation
Or anything affiliated with No Limit Records, you’re playing with fire
And when you’re playing with fire, you get burned
And any coward, punk chump that puts something on tape about another man
He’s a yellow belly, ‘cause real niggas, I mean, real killers don’t talk
I know I went off a little bit
Look, I’m not 2Pac but these jealous niggas got me strapped
(Got the Rev. strapped)
Now back to the sermon
Rest in peace to Eazy-E
(Eric Wright)
And to all you young niggas and bitches, don’t forget to wear your strap
I mean, don’t forget to get the condom
I don’t care if she give good head
Let her give head to the latex, let her lay down on the plastic
Watch yourself ‘cause that AIDS virus will creep up on you
