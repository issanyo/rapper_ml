[Silkk the Shocker]
Ya boy Shocker in the building
Heads Remain Anonymous
He Ain't Gotta Be Obvious
Ladies, if y'all thirsty, drinks on me
And you fake ballers, you know what to do
(Master P In Background)
Girls, We Like Dem Girls
We Gotta Have Them Girls
We Like Dem Girls, Girls, Girls, Girls

[Master P] + (Silkk the Shocker)
And y'all haters
Be gone, want, want want
Be gone, want, want want
Be gone, want, want want, Be Gone
You get money, (then take it to the floor) NEW NO LIMIT
You got game, (then take it to the floor) SILKK, MASTER P
You ain't scared, (then take it to the floor) PETEY PABLO
You came to party, (then take it to the floor) MIKE DIESEL ON THE BEAT

[Silkk the Shocker]
Just waking up in the morning, gotta thank god
I Don't Know but last night seemed kinda odd
The spot was hot, the place was packed
They had fat asses wall to wall and back to back
Imagine that, it was a hell of a scene
Either that or it was a hell of a dream, ya heard me
They had a few ballers but not that many
Alot of model-type chicks but not that skinny
I mean one in particular caught my eye
I mean she gave me a look when I walked by
Like "Yeah, we about to have some fun here"
Her mouth ain't move but her body sayin come here
Want want want so I passed the key
And got a hotel suite like Cassidy
And Kel, So I yell let's blaze the party
And something started up and it sounded like Atari
Shorty, tell me what your name is?
Playa, tell me what your game is?
Shorty, tell me why you came here?
Playa, show me what you working with?

[Chorus: Master P]
Girls, We Like Dem Girls
We Gotta Have Them Girls
We Like Dem Girls, Girls, Girls, Girls
Girls, We Like Dem Girls
We Gotta Have Them Girls
We Like Dem Girls, Girls, Girls, Girls

[Petey Pablo]
Now the hardest decision I got to make
Which girl am I humping today?
Petey Pablo done jumped back in the game
Got the world freek-a-leakin like they insane
Lifting their skirt, showing me thangs
Lifting their shirt, letting them hang
How they made they booty bounce to a beat these days
It's like a Luther Vandross song, So Amazing
Ugh, Ugh, Ugh, Ain't that crazy
Hey Silkk, I think I got something on my hand
This girl here wilder than the Taliban
I'ma bout leave here, take her to a lion's gate
On the back floor, I'm a jury mate
Don't worry bout the room, I got maids
Ain't price any cheaper, I got paper
Silkk The Shocker:
See me and these boys came to act a fool
The New No Limit, we don't play by the rules
I came to party, not to clap the game
Get C out of jail cause its time to get paid
Up and down and I ain't talking bout waves
I'm in the bentley getting my head done and I ain't talking bout braids

[Chorus]

[Master P]
I'm country mayne, I'll punch ya brain
I'll roll with the boys that'll pluck ya mayne
You get money, you better tuck ya mayne
The haters out here, they'll cut ya mayne
Get lose with it, stay true with it
We don't want it if you let bruce bruce hit it
Get lose with it, stay true with it
We don't want it if you let bruce bruce hit it
Her neck, her back
We can fix it in my Lac
Her neck, her back
We can fix it in my Lac

[Chorus]

[Silkk over Chorus]
Shorty, I'ma get with you
But like Chingy, I'm only one call away
I mean I'm a baller, take that away
I'll call you heh
