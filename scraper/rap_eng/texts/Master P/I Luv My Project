[Krazy talking]
You niggas don't know what kinda fuckin' life is is project life is
Project life is a whole nother muthafuckin' life
You niggas that ain't come from our area you came from tha suburbs
You niggas can't feel what we go thru in tha projects nigga

[Krazy]
Remember me a little quiet young nigga on tha block
Big Edwin named me Krazy & Ace gave me a Glock
Ever since then I been straight buckin', mean muggin'
About to fight this lawyer cause this bitch is buggin'
Tellin' me to plead guilty yeah what's up
I'mma fight this shit in trail nigga grab my nuts
My & my lil' brother Sam screamin' out cut side
Disrespect a nigga hood it's a must you die
Me & my nigga Oreo gettin' blowed out
Just runnin' from tha cops gettin' wo' out
My nigga telly Bill just got smoked I'm drinkin' hennessey
I won't rest until I found out who smoked him G
I gettin' letters from heaven tellin' me Krazy be cool
If I woulda gotta smoked you woulda revenged me fool
Nigga I feel tha same I put a mill on his head
I won't rest until his whole fuckin' family is dead now

[Chorus: Ezel Swang]
I was born in a project
Nigga I'm down for my project
I slung drugs in my project
Nigga I luv my project
I was born in a project
Nigga I'm down for my project
I luv my project
Nigga I slung drugs in my project

[Krazy]
My cousin Deon read enough of me it at no secrect
I'm from dat same blood line so nigga peep it
When i scream out in battle my niggas my niggas gonna buck
When i scream out clown fake niggas get snuck
When we head to Martin Luther King dats when shit gets real
When we take it to dat rat hole niggas get killed
I represent where I'm from it ain't no lie
We rat hole, yellow high way til tha day dat I die
I still thunk about William when we went to gust
R.I.P. you & Russell for yall I bust
Me & dat mnigga Tunnavo we moved to tha Ville
My nigga just ain't been tha same since VL got killed
I can't forget my nigga Lipps I know yall smilin'
You, Chuck, & Witty I know yall wilin'
Every nigga dat I named died in tha project
We put they name on tha wall outta respect now

[Chorus]

[Master P]
See these feds wanna indite me
These niggas don't like me
These hoes steady trippin' but it's all about wifey
Now if i go to tha pen then dat come wit tha game
A couple of years later release tha dog of tha chain
Now niggas gotta respect me cause I done balled wit tha best
Nap, Meatball, Marlo, & Glen Mess
An my ghetto heroes they still huntin' tha street
An all these war stories told ain't no squashin' beef
Kevin, Randall, Vernell, Telly, & Chris
All my whodi's out tha projects so all my whodi's missed
C-P-3 homie i took it in blood
Dat me & my niggas we scream it in clubs

[Chorus]

[Krazy]
Rest In piece nigga ball til' you fall
This is for my niggas wit they name on tha wall(2X)
Rest In piece nigga ball til' you fall
This is for my outlaws wit they name on tha wall
Rest In piece nigga ball til' you fall
This is for my thugs wit they name on tha wall

[Master P talking]
The Ghetto Bill Gates & Krazy this for all my project niggas out there
Gettin' dat money yall hold yall heads up to all my niggas on a wall
Dat Calliope, dat Iberville, dat Magnolia to dat Lafayette ha ha
Dat Melphomine, Dat Desire, every project nigga & every project chick
Across tha world R.I.P
