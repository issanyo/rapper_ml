[Verse 1:]
Yeah bae
You know nobody understand me but you
That’s why I ain’t tripping on nobody but you
I don’t want nobody else
I don’t want nobody else
You’re a genius, you digging me
I don’t want nobody else
You better let em know
I don’t want nobody else
That’s just how it goes
I’m not thinking about nobody else
I’m just thinking about you
I don’t want nobody else, bae I just want you (oh yeah)
I’m on it
Fucking this chick all of this money
Thinking about you make me feel some kind of way
Give me the secret, I just might make you my bae (what you say)
You want it, come get it, you hit it, you lick it
Work out it like fitness
[?]
Can I get a witness
He said it so good, god damn it’s so good
Become on my hitlist
Like an LLC, when you fuck with me you gonna get it

[Chorus:]
I don’t want nobody else [x2]
I ain’t thinking about nobody
I’m just thinking about you (thinking about you)
I don’t want nobody else
You better let em know
I don’t want nobody else
That’s just how it goes
I’m not thinking about nobody else
I’m just thinking about you
I don’t want nobody else bae, I just want you

[Verse 2:]
When I’m not with you, I want it
When I’m with you, I’m on it
I could be with you all night and come back in the morning
And when I’m with you baby it’s to the roof (to the roof)
N*gga got a problem, cock back and shoot
Girl, you’re the one I want and you’re the one I need
I ain’t tripping on nobody it’s just you and me
You my hustle baby
I get money with you
Capital baby, screw the honey with you

[Chorus]

[Verse 3:]
See lately I’ve been seeking
Hey shorty, I’ve been thinking
I’ve been smoking, I’ve been drinking
Maybe we can chill this weekend
I’m from Cali I ain’t tripping
Girl let’s head to the beach
Pop us a couple bottles
Turn a good girl a freak
I see that she feel me
Her freak is that kill me
The morning we thuggin
I’m breaking it down while she rolling it up
Girl don’t trip off the lamp cuz he nothing
[?]
She know I’m the truth
[i?]

[Chorus]

[Verse 4:]
I sent a text cuz I was thinking about her
She text at the same time
LOL when she replied back with an emoji smile
Don’t want nobody else
I told her ditto
Because the way you make me feel
My heart paradiddle, just a little
Gotta keep my composure we’re moving in closer
First I would shut doors in your face
Look at me opening doors up
Look what I found somebody holding it down
When I was down, she stayed around and held me down

[Chorus:]
I ain’t thinking about nobody, I’m just [x2]
I’m just thinking about you
I ain’t thinking about nobody, I’m just thinking about you
I’m alright for you
I’m gonna hold you down
I’ve said that all my life babe (I don’t want nobody)
Now I ain’t thinking about nobody
I’m just thinking about you
Trying to make you my boo (I’m just thinking about you)
I don’t want nobody else
I don’t want nobody else (you’re my baby, you’re my baby)
I ain’t thinking about nobody
I’m just thinking about you (thinking about you)
I don’t want nobody else
I just want you
I’m gonna hold it down for you
