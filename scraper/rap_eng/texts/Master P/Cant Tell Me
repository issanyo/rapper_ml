Pull up in that Rolly and then hop out

Enjoying life and I ain’t worried bout no hater

[Verse 1]
I got money in the bank, everyday feel like Christmas
Just called my momma up
I’m on the road, I tell her I miss her
It’s Mr. Goldman with some ice on my wrist
With the ‘K’ in the trunk, told them haters I don’t miss
Tell them boys gon’ with a girl with a big booty
Blowing bubbles out the kush nigga
That’s how we do it
Ferrari lights on in the day time
Just parking that ass to breakin my baseline
