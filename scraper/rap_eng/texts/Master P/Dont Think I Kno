[Hook]
It’s a shame how you mess around with my love
It’s a shame how you tryna bear around with my pride
I know some shit you don’t think I know
That’s I ain’t fucking witcho ass no more
I know some shit you don’t think I know
That’s I ain’t fucking witcho ass no more

[Verse 1]
More money more problems
I always been a hustler nigga, I never been a robber
Why a bitch tryna play me when I’m tryna do right
Why niggas tryna play me when I’m tryna change my life
Keep wind up in a chain
I ain’t fucking with no snakes
My boy got the plug, 22 for the chicken
Nigga play defense out here in these streets
I don’t serve no niggas and they don’t owe me

[Hook]
It’s a shame how you mess around with my love
It’s a shame how you tryna bear around with my pride
I know some shit you don’t think I know
That’s I ain’t fucking witcho ass no more
I know some shit you don’t think I know
That’s I ain’t fucking witcho ass no more

[Verse 2]
She say she love me but don’t love me like she said she love me
I introduce her to the product, turn her on a hustler
I bought the bitch and , that’s what i thought I was up straight for stuntin’
Bitch tryna play on me like the pop wasn’t street smart
I know your motive, you tryna get my commitment, hold up
But I know and not gon’ scheme me, leave in the morning
Just get your shit and get the fuck out
Don’t worry bout how I know it
I know it now I’m going places you ain’t going

[Hook]
It’s a shame (bitch) how you mess around with my love
It’s a shame how you tryna bear around with my pride
I know some shit you don’t think I know
That’s I ain’t fucking witcho ass no more
I know some shit you don’t think I know
That’s I ain’t fucking witcho ass no more

[Verse 3]
Listen, told all my hips friends you tried to play me
Glock 23 ain’t got no safety
Put it on your ass I’m that dead Raven (yeah)
These niggas and these bitches think it’s all bravery (nope)
I’m balling like a motherfucker cutting up
You was hating on me, you done fucked up (fucked up)
Money to the ceiling boy ain’t got fun
I was talking bout them bills, the last of ‘em

[Bridge]
Bangin’ and swingin’
Hustle for the mil
Ice for the chill
And the chrome for the kill
Real stay real, fake stay away
Hit you with the left and make you fall right away
Stop all the hatin’ start countin’ platin’
Niggas getcho money up and stop all the hatin’
See i just hang out with my plug
Cause I’m tryna flip sum’n
Now I’m heading to the boat cause he wanna ship sum’n

[Hook]
It’s a shame how you mess around with my love
It’s a shame how you tryna bear around with my pride
I know some shit you don’t think I know
That’s I ain’t fucking witcho ass no more
I know some shit you don’t think I know
That’s I ain’t fucking witcho ass no more
