Chorus:
I'll always come back to you
I'll always come back to you
I'll always come back to you
I'll always come back to you

Lil whodi lost his life this ghetto shit got em
Some friends knocked on his door but we don't really know who shot em
I lost a homie and a brother in the same week
And momma got bags under her eyes she gets no sleep
And these chickens love to flip flop
I seen a hardest thug lose his life in the hood behind some zip locks
I wrote Kevin on the wall but never moved on
Girls screamin at the funeral cuz you was smooth homes
Me and you and jimmy we used to ride together
We all family lil one we supposed to die together
But you had to go first (first)
I mean the first to make it out the ghetto but you left in a hearse
Now the preacher sayin life goes on after the rain
After the pain but it ain't the same
I remember we used to ball together
Me and you homie hustlin project halls together
Whodi we all stood tall together
Silkk C and me got you on our arms forever

Chorus:

We popped dollars together
Counted dollars together
We was on a roll doin shows nigga
We was always together
I lost so many peers
Shared so many tears
It's a trip to see so many rappers get killed
And uh its' a mystery on 2Pac
Biggie Smalls changed his life and the next day he got shot
Easy E died of aids
And its so many unknown rappers lyin in graves
To the media you ain't shit till you die
You make the cover of every magazine when you take that final ride
Big Pun went triple platinum when his heart stopped
On the radio and video stations nonstop
Who wanna be next
While you a dead superstar the record company still cashin checks
Pour some liquor for the homies that done moved on
And light your lighters for the soldiers cuz they never gone

Chorus:
