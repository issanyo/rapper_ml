Black chopper with the scope sittin on the porch waitin for the blow

So Tell me me what the fuck is sleep
I thought I knew what hustlin was til I met P
Excuse my French Veraces slim straight to point boy will don’t bend
But them Choppa clips got Scoliosis
Grillem like el pollo loco
Pull up in that Phantom they go Casper when the doors open
And that lil bitch that’s on the hood look like a trophy
My shooting deserve a trophy my niggas deserve them porches
Porcelain floors foreign whores and all on forbes
I’m out the 3 but In love with them foreign cars
I'm ACE

(Chorus)
The streets is rockin' with us ain't no competition
Ain't no limit to the money that a nigga getting
Fuck your trophies nigga and your award shows

(FAME-O)
All I do is windmill
Fuck with my niggas and get killed
Have you shittin on yourself now you found out that shits real
I make the pistol pop like a tip drill I make the shotty pump like a pair
Of heels
Make your girl suck till she can't kneel
Made myself hot now I can't chill
Really though I can chill when I put your body on a bag of ice
Told mama Im livin life she holla stop son you not livin right
But who are you to judge when you don’t live the life I live
Go and ask Charlie bout me nigga all I do is win
