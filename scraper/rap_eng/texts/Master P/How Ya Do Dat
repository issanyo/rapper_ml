[Young Bleed]
Nigga say who that, say they wanna do that
Run up if you will and get ya ass whipped blue black
My nigga my nerve, fresh off the curb
Jelly jam and preserve, nothin but balls and my word
And a mossburg pistol grip pump on my lap at all times
Whateva my nigga cause young niggas still dyin
Hollin bout huh, nigga what, huh, give a fuck nigga what
Full of that weed, planted like a poppy seed
A slanted and enchanted nappy nigga named Young Bleed Corleone
In the jungle, where the murder million mumble for months and days
Trippin off these blunts we blaze, hell of a high
And tellin em why, I'mma neva say die, You can see it my eyes
And niggas say I fly like a eagle and see no evil
And ain't no sequel to this here, this year I'm bailin in the dough
Supernatural, wit ends, y'all niggas don't here me though
But see how they runnin everything on the cool
But they know I'm fittin to act a fool in this motherfucker

Sent me a letter said P get yo paper don't trust these hoes
These niggas they'll take you, hustlin is a habit
Young bread cabbage, popcorn and grits nigga tryin to get a rabbit
What about a nice stallion to slide in, twenty inch Vogues and some candy
Painted to ride in, niggas flip change in the game cause we soldiers
Eyes hella red cause a nigga blowin doja
Tie the black shoe strangs, tight on the Reeboks
Grab yo ski mask, DKNY, I mean a plastic Glock
Hoes bounce that ass, niggas get dealt wit
Keep yo' enemy tight, nigga never thank quick
Pour out some liquor to tha homies I owe

In this musical fashion, if you don't know fool you betta ask em
Cause fools that wanna get wit I get wit em
When I put my gloves on, I'm bout to get gone, so long
Please mama may I, go out and be a playa, sippin' on Hennessey
A million bitches want me, my nigga passed tha herb, I took a token

So don't get full of that alcohol in tha club and thank you bad
Cuz if ya'll niggas start fuckin' up somebody gon' kick yo ass
Now who's that makin' that funky noise, it's tha locster comin' through
Wit all his boyz, fucked up and let a nigga get tha right place in time
So now foolz I'm goin' fo' mine, motherfuckers ungh
