[Intro]
I'm black on these streets
I'm Nino in these streets
I'm Fred Lucas in these streets
I'm Pablo in these streets

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm a, I'm a drug dealer
I'm a, I'm a drug dealer
Cause you know I got the plug nigga

[Verse 1: Master P]
(CP3)
Chop chop it, nigga, chop it up
I'm from the block, where we rock it up
I got bad bitches on my celly nigga
I don't fuck with snitches, man
I just smell them niggas

Kill a rat, kill a bitch
Thousand grams in my cup
And a nigga rich
Bitches all on me cause my paper right
I got killas riding with me cause I live that life

Ain't no studio nigga
I'm the real deal
Michael Jordan money nigga
A quarter bil'
But a nigga started right up in the projects
Stevie Wonder, I get money with my eyes shut

[Chorus: Master P]
I'm a, I'm a drug dealer x2
Cause you know I got the plug nigga
Who need some drugs nigga?
I'm a, I'm a drug dealer x2
Cause you know I got the plug nigga
I'm a, I'm a drug dealer

[Verse 2: Ace B]
I ain't never sold no drugs
But a drug dealer my favorite lick
While you out working
I'm in ya shit
With two nickel fifths
Just waitin' on ya
You come inside
I'm maimin' on ya
Like right now, I be [?]
You better give me what I want or I'm coming back
No mask, black bag, and a 30 Mac

But my closest friends all drug dealers
They house in Colebrook with drugs nigga
Ring ring, that's the plug nigga
And we ain't even talkin' 'bout drugs nigga
He just hit me up to show love nigga
Cause I get respect like the plug nigga

Ace Bronco
Fuck that, I'm Ace B-47 nigga

[Chorus]

[Verse 3: Alley Boy]
When I first started trapping I was selling nicks
[?] Nate Dogg [?]
Man the trap too slow, started takin' shit
Man it wouldn't be [?], never did shit
I'm a real H-Town don, and I never borrowed nothin'
Walk around [?], Teflon
150-thousand on my left arm
Real dope boy shit, just a lil' somethin'

[Bridge: BlaqNmilD]
I got a bundle in my sock
Cause I'm tryna dodge the cops
My Boost burner ringing
And I'm tryna catch a pie
I got a pocket full of money
And I'm 'bout to score an eighth
Imma chop it down to twenties
And keep the block running

[Chorus]

[Verse 4: Young Junne]
It's a cold world and it ain't winter
Cops apply the drugs to the drug dealers
And them young niggas shooting like Reggie Miller
I bet them shots burn like a shot of liquor
That's why my circle's small, no way to enter
And your best friend could end up your killer
I got a bag of hundreds, all for the strippers
And if she shake it right then I'm gonna tip her

Streets verified, fuck a Twitter nigga
Mixing up the work, fuck a blender nigga
My old head on Forbes list
And if he want he could go and buy the Clippers nigga
My favorite movie was Scarface
Learned to cut my grass and watch for the snakes
And if drugs was boxing nigga
I'd definitely be in that heavyweight
(Junne)

[Chorus]
