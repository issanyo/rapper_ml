[Intro: Master P]
Told y'all I was gon' let them niggas run that beef shit til I get tired of it
Then I'mma put them motherfuckers to sleep - you got them extra heaters nigga?
Let's go ride

[D.I.G.]
Who the fuck, that is, on the side of me
Yo who the fuck, that is, down to get high with me
Yo who the fuck, that is, down to ride with me
Yo who the fuck, that is, down to die with me
Yo who the fuck, that is, on the side of me
Yo who the fuck, that is, down to get high with me
Yo who the fuck, that is, down to ride with me
Yo who the fuck, that is, down to die with me

[Master P]
I'm feelin sick, I done swallowed a fuckin rock
I ain't even runnin, here comes the cops
I got my soldier gear on, and I'm motherfuckin ready
You Nightmare on Elm Street, you Jason and I'm Freddy
We got a job to do, then it's a motherfuckin lick
Fifty G's on his ass, then it's a motherfuckin split
Me and my homies gon' smoke and when we get done we gon' get blunted
And after we handle our business, we gonna chase after some honies
Nobody fuckin move, nobody get hurt
Don't make me put your face on a motherfuckin shirt
I'm from the 3rd Ward, where we all crack skulls
And we don't give a fuck cause we all toss broads
Now if you snitchin, then they gon' find you in a ditch
But if you bitchin, then they gon' find you with some dick
Nigga we Uptown, where the lights don't shine
But with the pistol, and this chrome, watch yo' ass get blind
By these youngster that I hang with, I mean these niggas I sang with
We all soldiers for life nigga, we on some gang shit

[Hook]

[D.I.G.]
A maniac killer, I'm the nigga quick to rip it up
So buck and get fucked stuck like Chuck bitch, now that ass is out of luck
I'm from the ruts of the city strictly ghetto born
Swoll up hard so you haters best be gone
Or he gone like that, I'm tragic on your street
I got what it take to get the Glock that knock you off your fuckin feet
I be the terror in the dark just like a thief
Releasin the beast, be deceased, all increase, uhh
T-E-C N-I-N-E, relieves to any problem
I got the fuckin cop killers nigga you can't dodge em
Like a mirage I'm the nigga you think you be seein
I'm leavin em stinkin I'm leavin em invisible even up when they dreamin
You don't where I went, or how this nigga gon' be on that ass
And blast, gimme the mic, I'mma show you what I mean froggy fat
But clean as a mouth full of Listerine
Unseen supreme the king, indisputable
Inflictin pain, even my name is immutable
My game is beautiful, fuck with me and I'll murder you

[Hook]
