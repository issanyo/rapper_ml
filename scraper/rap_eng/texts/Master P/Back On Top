Gameface UUUUUUHHHHHH
Check them haters out x6
What? What? What? What?
The new No Limit you heard me them round platinum tank

(Chorus)
No limit is back on top ya'll haters can't stop us now
(Turn your Gameface represent your nameplate)
No limit is back on top ya'll haters can't stop us now
(Turn your Gameface represent your nameplate)

Criticism in the party like its H20
In the back of the club sayin bring some more
Me and my soldgiers where the party at?
Hinicy, Gin, and Juice who ordered that?
Cause ya'll got cars and we got locked
Ya'll buy houses and we buy blocks
It ain't no limit to the dough i got
The Ghetto Bill Gates in the parkin lot

(Chorus)

Got my porkchop mixed with 2 eggs
A country tycoon with a hole lot of bread
Bentleys and Hummers we bout that there
And all my No Limit Soldgiers how you do that their?
A couple of pages left but man we got colder
6 feet 5 in the hood we break bolders
Smash supermodels cause they chicks to me
And a million dollars more is like grits to me

(Chorus)

Always willin out but if im not willin
You can take a picture of me on the island smilin
Love for the haters but they mostly envys
More type of sheperds on lock but they mostly 20's
Play this game we suppose to win
I drive a lot of cars but they mostly bentleys
Lot of glass for cris but they mostly bottles
See me with ghetto chicks but mostly models And um...

(Chorus)

Ya'll now we on top, but the tank ain't dropped
We be like non stop with the one spot on locked
You wanna play these games where the MVP's
So fresh, and so clean like some people in jeans UUUUUUHHHHHH

Oh Look, What, Look
We from the south where they got golds in they mouth
Barbeque's all day right in front of the house
We use slit and slang like
What's cracky man? What's happney man? We goin to a platinum man
We play ball all year its that all year
No Limit, P. Miller man that's all we wear
We run it phat soldgiers get down like that
From the club to the streets we get around like that
Sad vaper roll with dogs that will chase ya
There's love in the game but some will still rate ya
I'm the type jump a crowd and get hype
Rip in track check the source while mights

(Chorus)

Where them ballers at shot callers at?
Cris style more wet we want all of that
Where them ballers at shot callers at?
D. D. Rimin We want all of that
No Limit run this for you?
HELL YEA!!!
I said No Limit run this for you?
HELL YEA!!!

(Chorus til fade)
