[Intro]
Light ya joints, let's have a muthafuckin' smoke off
Yall niggas bout to see more of that country ass muthafuckin' Master P
From New Orleans to Richmond California
That nigga crazy ass, but check this out
Cali got that good ass weed, that good ass weed, that good ass weed
Them niggas in Cali got that good ass weed
That's why I'm on my way to the Northside

[Verse 1]
I'm so toke
I guess I'm gone of that green sticky
Just ripped a muthafuckin' hole in my brand new dicky's
From walkin to close to the fuckin barb wire
That's when I know I've got 10 dollars on some fire
If you can do this muthafucker
Let's get a 20
Fuck white zig zags
I need some brown stickys
I mean that swisha go good with that dank
Niggas be gettin fucked up in my hood like they smokin crank
But we not we gettin higher than fire
But I won't stop smokin dank till I retire
I wonder do they have dank up in heaven
And if they do I'll prolly do a muthafuckin' 211 (Me too)
For a bag of that green sticky
Up in heaven a nigga runnin round crazy like he done took a bicky
I'm not Dr. Dre, but I don't want nuttin but The Chronic
This dank keep me comin back like I'm hooked on phonics

[Chorus]
Whatever ya want whatever ya need fool I got it
Well let's go half on a bag of dank
Whatever ya want whatever ya need fool I got it
Well let's go half on a bag of dank

[Verse 2]
Let's meet my homie
That fool got hella weed
He sells like Spanish fly
Makes bitches get on their knees
Hoes be suckin dick
Fo that green sticky
Like this bitch named Michelle
And my partner Ricky
Fo a half a joint
That bitch got toasted
Drama in motel 6 gettin roasted
Legs all open drawers under the bed
She didn't know where she was at (where you at girl)
My little potnah was hittin it in her mouth into her throat
Hoes be smokin that dank to keep their nerves calm
I be smokin on that shit to get my perv on
It go good with that gin and juice and squishy squeak
That's how we do it every day of the week
I don't sleep but at night I get the munchies
And after I eat I be back smokin them green crunchies

[Chorus]
Whatever ya want whatever ya need fool I got it
Well let's go half on a bag of dank
Whatever ya want whatever ya need fool I got it
Well let's go half on a bag of dank
Whatever ya want whatever ya need fool I got it
Well let's go half on a bag of dank
Whatever ya want whatever ya need fool I got it
Well let's go half on a bag of dank

[Outro]
Yeah
Uhhh
Inhale
Let's go half on a bag of dank
I mean that green sticky
And how you do it
When you blowin?
You inhale
