Chillin' on the Dolph reminiscin'
Thinkin' about my dogs on the wall that I'm missin'
Pour out some drank on the Dolph then I click
How could I forget my dogs died over stupid shit
I try not to think but then my brain gone snap
Vision gettin' blurry, hand reachin' for my gat
Nightmares and murder got me trippin' when I'm sleepin'
Evil thoughts of my dead dogs got my mind tweakin'
Wake up and I'm sweatin' from my head to my toes
Migraine headache, body shakin' with a bloody nose
Rush to the bathroom, grab some water take a taste
Look into the mirror see Johnny Hodges face
Haunted by these visions that I'm seein' got me mad
Thinkin' about my brothers gettin' zipped up in that body bag
Gotta get revenge cause if I died I know my homies would
Master P, tell me something good

[Master P]
Look, these fools better realize
That we ten thousand motherfuckin' bloody hounds deep
Always beware of the enemy
Even those jealous here on the block
We lose one dog, we gotta kill ten cats

[Cougnut]
Years and days fly by and I still cry
I still wonder why my dogs had to die
Like my dog in the fast lane who started thangs
Maxcacious R-I-P I know ya feel me mayne
Feel good niggas, every dog got a day
So crack a forty and celebrate with your HK
Cause niggas dyin' young frontin' for a little fame
Gettin' ripped up in this bloody ass chess game
Life is different and I'm feelin' it as I get older
I play the cuts cause niggas dyin' man on every corner
And that's a take to be bleedin' on a fuckin' table
Or even took up in a body bag with a label
So R.I.P. to my dogs in every hood
P dog, tell me something good

[Master P]
Man the game ain't even the same
But you got to pack the heat now
In case the guppies tryin' to swamp a nigga
Up in the swamp, know what I'm sayin'
I refuse to be turned into some motherfuckin' soap
And wipe between them nigga ass like a dog
Society ain't shit man, done turned me out to a killer
I'm not sayin' don't handle ya business
But just make sure you got a plan
Cause a dog ain't shit when he caged up fool
You feel me Cougnut

[Cougnut]
I know you wanna know why I rap like this
Ever since "Scanlous" the 'Nut been merciless
Guess it's in my nature to express and confess
Some say I'm obsessed others say I'm straight possessed
I guess I'm kind of pumped hear me out before ya criticize
Songs I be writin' be make motherfuckers realize
Time is gettin' short, listen to what I spit
Ya might learn some game that'll keep from gettin' ya head split
Niggas talkin' shit, the ones actin' like they bigga
Soft rappin' suckers, MC Hammer type niggas
I don't give a fuck about em' puttin' em' in check
Just like rotten inside, busters you get no respect
This game is gettin' thicker by the minute if ya in it
Ya gotta stay true to the game, in to win it
Other rappers come ghetto then they cross to that other level
Transformers like that get they sucker free passes took
IMP Dogs mashin' on that ass till ya comatose
Motherfuck a gang, Ill Mannered mafioso
Comin' from The Bay, Frisco side, straight mysterious
And when ya come to town, ask your niggas man it's serious
Fools gettin' whooped on everyday cause I ain't havin' it
And if you gets away I'll see your ass at The Gavin

Ha, ha, ha
