[Verse 1: Chester Bennington & Mike Shinoda]
Don't you hold your breath 'cause I'm not coming down
The battlefields have left me only scars
And floating in the dark, I'm swimming in the sound
Of voices that should never been apart

[Pre-Drop: Chester Bennington & Mike Shinoda]
Darker than the blood
Higher than the sun
This is not the end
You are not the only one

[Drop]

[Verse 2: Chester Bennington & Mike Shinoda]
With venom on their tongues, they paint it on the walls
Where justice doesn't have the strength to hold
The higher that they climb, the harder they will fall
And we will break their bones until they fall

[Pre-Drop: Chester Bennington & Mike Shinoda]
Darker than the blood
Higher than the sun
This is not the end
You are not the only one

[Drop]

[Bridge: Mike Shinoda & Chester Bennington]
Ahh, ah-ah, ahh, ahh
Ahh, ah-ah, ahh, ahh, ahh, ahh
(Oh, oh-oh, ohh, ohh, ohh)

[Pre-Drop: Chester Bennington & Mike Shinoda]
(Darker than the blood) Darker than the blood
(Higher than the sun) Higher than the sun
(This is not the end) This is not the end
(You are not the ohh...) You are not the only one

[Drop: Chester Bennington & Mike Shinoda]
This is not the end
(You are not the ohh...) You are not the only one
(Higher than the sun)
(This is not the end) This is not the end
(You are not the only...) You are not the only one
