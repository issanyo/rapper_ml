[Martin Luther King, Jr.]
I come to this magnificent house of worship tonight
Because my conscience leaves me no other choice
A true revolution of values will lay hand on the world order
And say of war;
"This way of settling differences is not just
This business of burning human beings with napalm
Of filling our nation's homes with orphans and widows
Of injecting poisonous drugs of hate
Into the veins of peoples normally humane
Of sending men home from dark and bloody battlefields
Physically handicapped and psychologically deranged
Cannot be reconciled with wisdom, justice, and love"

Cannot be reconciled with wisdom, justice, and love"
Cannot be reconciled with wisdom, justice, and love"
Cannot be reconciled with wisdom, justice, and love"
Cannot be reconciled with wisdom, justice, and love"
