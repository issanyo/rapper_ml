It's high voltage you can't shake the shock
Because nobody wants it to stop, check it out
It's high voltage you can't shake the shock
Because nobody wants it to stop, check it out

I've been digging into crates ever since I was livin in space
Before the ratrace, before apes had human traits
I mastered numerology with bigbang theology
Performed lobotomies we're telekinetic psychology
Invented the mic so I could start blessin it
And chincheckin kids to make my point like an impressionist
Many men have tried to shake us
But I twist mic cords to double helixes and show them what I'm made of
I buckle knees like leg braces
Cast the spell of instrumental-ness and all emcees that hate us
So try on, leave you without a shoulder to cry on
From now to infinity let icons be bygones
I fire bomb ghostly notes haunt this
I've tried threats but moved on to a promise
I stomp shit with or without an accomplice
And run the gauntlet with whoever that wants this

It's high voltage you can't shake the shock
Because nobody wants it to stop, check it out
It's high voltage you can't shake the shock
Because nobody wants it to stop, check it out
It's high voltage you can't shake the shock
Because nobody wants it to stop, check it out
It's high voltage you can't shake the shock
Because nobody wants it to stop, check it out

Akira, put a kink in the backbones of clones with microphones
Never satisfy my rhyme jones
Sprayin bright day over what you might say
Blood type krylon
Technicolor type A
On highways right with road rage I'm patient to win
The cage and the tin to bounce all around
Surround sound devouring the scenes
Subliminal gangrene paintings
Overall the same things sing songs karaoke copy madness
Break bones verbally with sticks and stone tactics
Fourth dimension, combat convention
Write rhymes with ease while the tracks stand at attention (Attention)
Meant to put you away with the pencil
Pistol, official, 16 line rhyme missile
While you risk it all, I pick out of your flaws
Singin, blah blah blah blah
You can say you saw

It's high voltage you can't shake the shock
Because nobody wants it to stop, check it out
It's high voltage you can't shake the shock
Because nobody wants it to stop, check it out
It's high voltage you can't shake the shock
Because nobody wants it to stop, check it out
It's high voltage you can't shake the shock
Because nobody wants it to stop, check it out

It's high voltage you can't shake the shock
Because nobody wants it to stop, check it out
It's high voltage you can't shake the shock
Because nobody wants it to stop, check it out
It's high voltage you can't shake the shock
Because nobody wants it to stop, check it out
It's high voltage you can't shake the shock
Because nobody wants it to stop, check it out
