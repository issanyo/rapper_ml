[Verse 1]
Excuse me while I kiss the sky
Sing a song of sixpence, pocket full of lies
Thinking I'm okay, but they're saying otherwise
Tell me how I look but can't look me in the eyes
Watching as I say this and then I do that
Telling them the old words but in a new rap
Then I change my mind up and make them lose track
Shit I'm inconsistent I thought they knew that

[Pre-Chorus]
Maybe I should be more grateful
That I had to watch it all come undone
Holding so tight to the edge is painful
But I can't ignore it I know

[Chorus]
They're watching as I fall, they're staring as I go
I gave until my soul hurt, and never told them so
They're watching as I fall, to somewhere down below
But maybe I'm just falling, to get somewhere they won't

[Verse 2]
Excuse me while I sympathize
Singing with the fat lady tell me what's the time
You know what it is not afraid to cross the line
Nothing is forever don't be mad at the design
Ask me if I can, I say I don't know
And honestly I buy that I can sound cold
Still upset from shit that's 15 years old
I don't know what it takes to make me let go

[Pre-Chorus]
Maybe I should be more grateful
That I had to watch it all come undone
Holding so tight to the edge is painful
But I can't ignore it I know

[Chorus]
They're watching as I fall, they're staring as I go
I gave until my soul hurt, and never told them so
They're watching as I fall, to somewhere down below
But maybe I'm just falling, to get somewhere they won't
