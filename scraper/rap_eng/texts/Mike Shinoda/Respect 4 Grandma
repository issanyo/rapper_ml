[Verse 1: Ryu]
Scoop Deville
Your now rocking with a drunken battle
We pack pumps like sluts when they
Traveling with shoes in the trunk
Im losing it punk, missing a few screws and a nut
Im stupid as fuck, Im from the old school but I flunked
Black on Black, rips with some grain to grip
Bitch slapping these trick rappers, till they pay this pimp
Quit acting the click clacking like you famous shit
You faggots are broke with names out of gangsta flicks (biatch)
What a joke, you ain't never cut up coke on a scale
Or snuck dope through the border in a cocanut shell
Fuck No! You want tell your little veteran tales
So when I put the smoke in your mouth you better inhale
Suck it!

[Verse 2: Tak]
You ready lets get it, the games now finished
Its's all, weapons to aim with a 1000 rounds in it
Machine shop class mixtaped lynch men
Clapping at your tracks rabbits back to the benches yea
People famous call me the evil genius
Got them bumpin Styles
In the Buick people speeding
Brim with the tilt, cigar on my clutch
Your crying over spilled milk
Demigodz whats up?
Got a flask filled of that ole lucky number 7 brand
Get rid of your first string
I ain't playing second hand
Your messing with butane, get scorched in a torch fire
Look out for the new slang, you rocking with Fort Minor

[Bridge: Celph Titled]
Allrigth hold for a second
Yeah you know who the fuck this is
SOB mother fuckas
Demigodz mother fuckas
Mike Shinoda Mother Fuckas
And this is Celph Titled Mother Fuckas
We put a pipe bomb in your tail pipe and it go off mother fuckas
My gun don't fit through the doorway mother fuckas lets Go!

[Verse 3: Mike]
This is the last warning shot before we're letting this go
We don't have to say lay low, ya'll already know
That when the lights goes dim and the beat drops in
Even Texas can't hold them, ante up and Im in
Im like Black Jack Johnson and MOP
Drinking handfuls of Jack Daniels (you'll see)
Cause when we hop into the Jeep to try out the CD
You'll want a low rider bucking bronco to Scoop's beat now
My name's Mike (Mike), remember it well
More rock than raising hell, Rougher then Roc Deville
Ryu and Tak will tell you whats really the deal
If you want it come get us at the end of this twelve

[Outro: Celph Titled]
Yea yea yea, you know the fuckin drill
Keeping it Godzilla up in the mother fuckin Home Depot
This is Celph Titled, the lame mile killer
This SOB, this is Demigodz, this is M Shinoda the cobra holder
And this is your brain on crack mother fucka!

Perfect... the guy is a genius
