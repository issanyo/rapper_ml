Coming at you

[Verse 1: Mike Shinoda]
Peep the style and the kids checking for it
The number one question is how could you ignore it
We drop right back in the cut the evil genius track and Mike's raps got you backing this up like, rewind that
Got you backing this up like, rewind that
We're just rolling with the rhythm
Rise from the ashes of stylistic division
With these non-stop lyrics of life living
Not to be forgotten but still unforgiven
But in the meantime there are those
Who want to talk this and that so I suppose
That it gets to a point feelings got to get hurt
And get dirty with the people spreading the dirt, it's like

[Hook: Chester Bennington]
I try to give you warning, but everyone ignores me
I told you niggas ten times, stop fuckin' with me
But nobody's listening
Call to you so clearly, but you don't want to hear me
I told you niggas now ten times, stop fuckin' with me, but nobody's listening

[Verse 2: Mike Shinoda]
I got a heart full of pain, head full of stress
Handful of anger held in my chest
And everything left's a waste of time
I hate my rhymes but hate everyone else's more
I'm riding on the back of this pressure
Guessing that its better I can't keep myself together
Because all of this stress gave me something to ride on
The pain gave me something I could set my sights on
You never forget the blood, sweat, and tears
The uphill struggle over years, the fear and
Trash talking and the people it was to
What up to the militia and the LPU

[Hook: Chester Bennington]
I try to give you warning, but everyone ignores me
I told you niggas ten times, stop fuckin' with me
But nobody's listening
Call to you so clearly, but you don't want to hear me
I told you niggas now ten times, stop fuckin' with me, but nobody's listening

[Outro: Mike Shinoda & *Chester Bennington*]
We got a heart full of pain, head full of stress
*Nobody's listening*
Handful of anger held in my chest
*Nobody's listening*
Uphill struggle, blood, sweat and tears
*Nobody's listening*
Yo, watch your back, machine shop is here
Fort Minor, we major

[Sample: Kanye West]
C'mon homie we major
We major? C'mon homie we major
We major, c'mon homie we major
We major, c'mon
