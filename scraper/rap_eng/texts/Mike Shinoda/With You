[Verse 1: Mike Shinoda]
I woke up in a dream today
To the cold of the static, and put my cold feet on the floor
Forgot all about yesterday
Remembering I'm pretending to be where I'm not anymore
A little taste of hypocrisy
And I'm left in the wake of the mistake, slow to react
And though you're so close to me
You're still so distant
And I can't bring you back

[Pre-Chorus: Chester Bennington]
It's true the way I feel
Was promised by your face
The sound of your voice
Painted on my memories
Even if you're not with me

[Chorus: Chester Bennington and Mike Shinoda]
I'm with you
You, now I see, keeping everything inside
With you
You, now I see, even when I close my eyes

[Verse 2: Mike Shinoda]
I hit you and you hit me back
We fall to the floor, the rest of the day stands still
Fine line between this and that
When things go wrong I pretend that the past isn't real
Now I'm trapped in this memory
And I'm left in the wake of the mistake, slow to react
So even though you're close to me
You're still so distant
And I can't bring you back

[Pre-Chorus: Chester Bennington]
It's true the way I feel
Was promised by your face
The sound of your voice
Painted on my memories
Even if you're not with me

[Chorus: Chester Bennington and Mike Shinoda]
I'm with you
You, now I see, keeping everything inside
With you
You, now I see, even when I close my eyes
With you
You, now I see, keeping everything inside
With you
You, now I see, even when I close my eyes

[Bridge: Chester Bennington]
No, no matter how far we've come
I can't wait to see tomorrow
No matter how far we've come, I
I can't wait to see tomorrow

[Chorus: Chester Bennington and Mike Shinoda]
With you
You, now I see, keeping everything inside
With you
You, now I see, even when I close my eyes
With you
You, now I see, keeping everything inside
With you
You, now I see, even when I close my eyes
