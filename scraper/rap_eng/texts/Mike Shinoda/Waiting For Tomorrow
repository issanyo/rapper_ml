[Verse 1]
Remember we were staring up to those peaks on the horizon?
You told me if I faced my fears, there was no doubt I could climb them

[Pre-Chorus]
There's nothing I have wanted more
The only one I've been waiting for
So hold your breath and close your eyes
The night is cold but the sun will rise

[Chorus]
Counting down to the light, through the night
Just waiting for tomorrow
Almost there, almost time
All my life, just waiting
It's only one more day
It's only one more day
It's only one more day
It's only one more, waiting for tomorrow

[Post-Chorus]
Just waiting for tomorrow

[Verse 2]
Fear is creeping up behind as this road is finally ending
I can't find order in my mind with this noise inside so deafening

[Pre-Chorus]
There's nothing I have wanted more
The only one I've been waiting for
So hold your breath and close your eyes
The night is cold but the sun will rise

[Chorus]
Counting down to the light, through the night
Just waiting for tomorrow
Almost there, almost time
All my life, just waiting
It's only one more day
It's only one more day
It's only one more day
It's only one more, waiting for tomorrow

[Bridge]
Just waiting
It's only one more day
It's only one more day
It's only one more day
It's only one more day
It's only one more day
It's only one more day
It's only one more day
It's only one more, waiting for tomorrow
Waiting for tomorrow
Waiting for tomorrow

[Outro: instrumental]
Waiting for tomorrow
