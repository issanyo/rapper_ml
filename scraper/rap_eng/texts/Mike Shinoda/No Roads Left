[Verse 1]
Standing alone with no direction
How did I fall so far behind?
Why am I searching for perfection
Knowing it's something I won't find?

[Pre-Chorus]
In my fear and flaws
I let myself down, again
All because

[Chorus]
I run 'til the silence splits me open
I run 'til it puts me underground
'Til I have no breath
And no roads left but one

[Verse 2]
When did I lose my sense of purpose?
Can I regain what's lost inside?
Why do I feel like I deserve this?
Why does my pain look like my pride?

[Pre-Chorus]
In my fear and flaws
I let myself down, again
All because I let myself down
In my fear and flaws

[Chorus]
I run 'til the silence splits me open
I run 'til it puts me underground
'Til I have no breath
And no roads left but one
No roads left but one

[Pre-Chorus]
In my fear and flaws
I let myself down, again
All because

[Chorus]
I run and the silence splits me open
I run and it puts me underground
But there's no regret
And no roads left to run
