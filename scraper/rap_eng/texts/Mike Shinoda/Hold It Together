[Verse 1]
She said, "Are you okay?"
And I'm staring into space
It's making her nervous cause one thing is certain
I don't have my head on straight
We're trying to get through each week
On two or three hours of sleep
I say to be patient
That we're going to make it
I have to admit that I'm struggling

[Pre-Chorus]
They say take it slow
But the world keeps spinning
And that I don't control
And so there I go
Trying to act normal
So they won't know thatâ€¦

[Chorus]
I'm just trying to hold my shit together
Together, darling
I'm just trying to hold my shit together
Together, darling

[Verse 2]
They say that they sympathize
I'm grateful they take the time
But bringing it up at this six year old birthday
It kinda fucks up my vibe
We end on an awkward note
I make the most awkward joke
Too dark to be funny
I shouldn't have come, it'd be weird to go home
And I'm struggling

[Pre-Chorus]
They say take it slow
But the world keeps spinning
And that I don't control
And so there I go
Trying to act normal
So they won't know that...

[Chorus]
I'm just trying to hold my shit together
Together darling
I'm just trying to hold my shit together
Together darling

[Bridge]
Oh, I don't know what else to try
Pretend I'm in control
But, I'm just trying to hold my shit together
Together darling

[Chorus]
I'm just trying to hold my - together
Together darling
I'm just trying to hold my shit together
Together darling

[Outro]
Oh, I don't know what else to try
Pretend I'm in control
But, I'm just trying to hold my shit together
Together darling
