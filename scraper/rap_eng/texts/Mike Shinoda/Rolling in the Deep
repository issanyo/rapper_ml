There's a fire starting in my heart
Reaching a fever pitch and it's bringin' me out the dark
Finally, I see you crystal clear
Go ahead and sell me out, while I'll lay your shit bare

See how I'll leave with every piece of you
Don't underestimate the things that I will do
There's a fire starting in my heart
Reaching a fever pitch and it's bringin' me out the dark

The scars of your love remind me of us
They keep me thinkin' that we almost had it all
The scars of your love, they leave me breathless
I can't help feeling

We could have had it all
Rolling in the deep
You had my heart inside of your hand
But you played it to the beat

Baby, I have no story to be told
But I've heard one on you and I'm gonna make your head burn
See me in the depths of your despair
Making a home down there 'cause mine sure won't be shared

The scars of your love remind me of us
They keep me thinkin' that we almost had it all
The scars of your love, they leave me breathless
I can't help feeling

We could have had it all
Rolling in the deep
You had my heart inside of your hand
But you played it to the beat

We could have had it all
Rolling in the deep
You had my heart inside of your hand
But you played it with a beating

Throw your soul through every open door
Count your blessings to find what you're looking for
Turn my sorrow into treasured gold
Pay me back in time and reap just what you sow

You're gonna wish you never had met me
Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep
You're gonna wish you...
You could have had it all

You could have had it all
Rolling in the deep
You had my heart inside of your hand
But you played it, you played it, you played it
You played it to the beat
