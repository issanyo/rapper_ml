Remember that night
I had to leave you
You said it's alright
And I believed you
You know I'm no good
No good at goodbyes
No good without you
Better by your side

Wish I could be there with you
I'm feeling lost without you

In this empty bed
Where I'm all alone
I've been such a mess
Need a one way ticket

Anywhere you are
Is where I want to go
You are my address
I don't care how I get it
I need a one way ticket
Home

When you're not with me
These days are boring
Wish it were easy
Like Sunday morning
When I'd be waking up with you
Only doing those things we wanna do
My heart is anywhere you go
When I'm next to you I'm home

Wish I could be there with you
I'm feeling lost without you

In this empty bed
Where I'm all alone
I've been such a mess
Need a one way ticket

Anywhere you are
Is where I want to go
You are my address
I don't care how I get it
I need a one way ticket
Home
One way tickey
Home
I need a one way ticket
Home

In this empty bed
Where I'm all alone
I've been such a mess
(I've been such a mess)

In this empty bed
Where I'm all alone
I've been such a mess
Need a one way ticket

Anywhere you are
Is where I want to go
You are my address
I don't care how I get it
I need a one way ticket
Home
One way tickey
Home
I need a one way ticket
Home
Oh


I don't care how I get it
I need a one way ticket
Home
