[Verse 1: Mike Shinoda]
They say welcome back Mike, it's a pleasure to have you
You the hot shit like metal to magnets
Come 'round back to the staff door access
Light up a Cuban, spot a pig mattress
Autograph action, sneak through the door
S.O.B. and me turning your peace into war
So turn the fucking beat up some more
And step back pronto, reload the combo
Mike, Ryu and Tak
It's like some Mo Wade and Marley Marl symphony rock
You could turn off the beat and couldn't get me to stop
I could give a fat fuck if you're with me or not
I do not give a damn
Got tracks on the Billboard but here I am
With my man Green Lantern raising hell again
And so way past go, never sold my soul

[Hook: Beth Gibbons]
I'm losing myself
My desire I can't have
No reason am I for

[Verse 2: Ryu]
You see what I've become, top gun mach one
Achtung baby I'm the best, I ain't got another option
Grotesque yet, so fresh, yes never lost not once
You see what I've become, the last six months
My lyrics went from "oh shit" to "oh fuck"
This dude is a problem, don't front
The last of the west coast rappers that don't suck
This isn't even fun no more
I done killed so many people that my gun gets bored
Why fight now, I already won this war
Everything you think is hot man, I done before
From the block shit to the rap shit
To the rock shit even to the pop shit
Fatten up my pocket, profit
Fucking with me, see nothing is free
It's R-Y-U from that S.O.B, suck it

[Verse 3: Tak]
Can't get a grip, plan sorta slips
Stand in front of a fan with his hands full of shit
Covered the face before the camera clicked
Damn, they call him a hell of a man with a lisp
Can't escape the dark or erase the thought
His heart beats quicker than a racing horse
So he blocks his own reflection and ducks from sunlight
Then both worlds collide and result in a gunfight
Cuts in his chest still, Russian roulette wheel
Mistakes might have splattered in the guts into left field
Ooh, take a deep breath for the recess
Things on the brain to remain as a defect
Yeah, a newborn with a new curse
Fits like a shoe horn in a blue hearse
Dim the lights for the lampshade glow
Pull out the pen and let the whole damn thing blow

[Hook]
