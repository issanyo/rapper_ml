This is not a story that you've heard or you know
Everyone in black from the head to the toe
And I'm sitting in the back in the very last row
Hearing everyone ask why I go

Ladies and gentlemen we're gathered here today
To talk about the end and a friend gone away
Talking about pretending, they don't know what to say
And they're tripping over words but they're talking anyway
Mingling and singing all these really sad songs
Talking of what I did right and forgetting all my wrongs
Saying how they'll miss me so much now that I'm gone
Man this is depressing
Let's move on

Let's move on
Come back to life like the light of the dawn
It's like a tightrope just move right along
Don't look down and don't step wrong
We don't have time so just move on

Friends from my past wiping tears on their sleeve
In between people that were never close to me
And as I turn my back on everyone to leave
I know that I'll be back to see them all eventually
I've gotta go away just to try something new
Cause what I'm used to isn't all that I can do
Just a change of scenery, just another view
Take it back to the beginning
Take it back to the roots

Let's move on
Come back to life like the light of the dawn
It's like a tightrope just move right along
Don't look down and don't step wrong
We don't have time so just move on
Come back to life like the light of the dawn
It's like a tightrope just move right along
Don't look down and don't step wrong
We don't have time so just move on

Just move on
Just move
