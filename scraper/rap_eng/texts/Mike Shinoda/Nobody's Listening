[Intro: Mike Shinoda]
Come, come, come
Come, coming at you...
Come, coming at you...
Come, coming at you...
Yo...

[Verse 1: Mike Shinoda]
Peep the style and the kids checking for it
The number one question is: how could you ignore it?
We drop right back in the cut over basement tracks
With raps that got you backing this up like "rewind that"
We're just rolling with the rhythm
Rise from the ashes of stylistic division
With these non-stop lyrics of life living
Not to be forgotten, but still unforgiven
But in the meantime, there are those
Who wanna talk this and that, so I suppose
That it gets to a point where feelings gotta get hurt
And get dirty with the people spreading the dirt
It goes...

[Chorus: Chester Bennington & Mike Shinoda]
Try to give you warning, but everyone ignores me
(Told you everything loud and clear) But nobody's listening
Call to you so clearly, but you don't want to hear me
(Told you everything loud and clear) But nobody's listening

[Verse 2: Mike Shinoda]
I got a heart full of pain, head full of stress
Handful of anger held in my chest
And everything left's a waste of time
I hate my rhymes, but hate everyone else's more
I'm riding on the back of this pressure
Guessing that it's better I can't keep myself together
Because all of this stress gave me something to write on
The pain gave me something I could set my sights on
You never forget the blood, sweat, and tears
The uphill struggle over years, the fear
And trash-talking and the people it was to
And the people that started it, just like you

[Chorus: Chester Bennington & Mike Shinoda]
Try to give you warning, but everyone ignores me
(Told you everything loud and clear) But nobody's listening
Call to you so clearly, but you don't want to hear me
(Told you everything loud and clear) But nobody's listening

[Bridge: Mike Shinoda]
I got a heart full of pain, head full of stress
Handful of anger held in my chest
Uphill struggle, blood, sweat, and tears
Nothing to gain, everything to fear
Heart full of pain, head full of stress
Handful of anger held in my chest
Uphill struggle, blood, sweat, and tears
Nothing to gain, everything to fear
Heart full of pain

[Chorus: Chester Bennington & Mike Shinoda]
Try to give you warning, but everyone ignores me
(Told you everything loud and clear) But nobody's listening
Call to you so clearly, but you don't want to hear me
(Told you everything loud and clear) But nobody's listening

[Post-Chorus: Mike Shinoda & Chester Bennington]
I got a heart full of pain, head full of stress
Nobody's listening
Handful of anger held in my chest
Nobody's listening
Uphill struggle, blood, sweat, and tears
Nobody's listening
Nothing to gain, everything to fear
Nobody's listening

[Outro: Mike Shinoda]
Come, come, come, come, coming at you...
Come, coming, come, come, coming at you...
Come, coming, come, come, coming at...
Come, come, come, come
Coming at you from every side
