[J. Robert Oppenheimer]
We knew the world would not be the same
Few people laughed, few people cried, most people were silent
I remember the line from The Hindu Scripture, the Bhagavad-Gita
Vishnu is trying to persuade the prince that he should do his duty
And, to impress him, takes on his multi-armed form and says:
"Now I am become death, the destroyer of worlds"
I suppose we all thought that, one way or another
