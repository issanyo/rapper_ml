Everything you say to me
I need a little room to breathe
Everything you say to me
Takes me one step closer to the edge
I need a little room to breathe
And I'm about to break

Shut up when I'm talking to you
Shut up
Shut up when I'm talking to you
Shut up, shut up, shut up, shut up, SHUT UP!
BOBBY!
BOBBY! BOBBY! SHUT UP! SHUT UP!
GORDON!
GORDON!
GORDON GORDON GORDON GORDON GORDON GORDON GORDON!
SHUT UP! SHUT UP GORDON!
BUDDY! BUDDY! BUDDY! BUDDY! SHUT UP!
BUDDY! SHUT UP! BUDDY! WHAT?

[Buddy! Attention Buddy!]
[Shut up and step away from the drum kit!]
[Thank you]
[And good night.]
