We swim against the rising waves
And crash against the shore
The body bends until it breaks
The early morning sings, no more

We swim against the rising waves
And crash against the shore
The body bends until it breaks
Then sings again, no more

The wings have torn the flesh away
The early morning sings, no more

We swim against the rising waves
And crash against the shore
The body bends until it breaks
Then sings again, no more

The wings have torn the flesh away
The early morning sings, no more

'Cause time has torn the flesh away
The early morning sings, no more
