[Chorus]
They’ll tell you I don’t care anymore
And I hope you’ll know that’s a lie
'Cause I’ve found what I have been waiting for
But to get there means crossing a line

[Verse 1]
I don’t know how to warn you
For what I’m gonna say
'Cause you’re holding so tight to
What I’m taking away
I got demons inside me
So I’m faced with a choice
Either try to ignore them
Or I give them a voice

[Pre-Chorus]
And it’s keeping me up at night
Worried it’s not alright
Holding back things you don’t know
And it’s keeping me up at night
Worried it’s not alright
You’re not gonna like where this goes

[Chorus]
And they’ll tell you I don’t care anymore
And I hope you’ll know that’s a lie
'Cause I’ve found what I have been waiting for
But to get there means crossing a line
So I’m crossing a line

[Verse 2]
It’s not about status
We know it never was
'Cause what good is the kingdom
When you’re missing the love?
This is not a goodbye now
I’m not going away
No, I don’t have the answers
But I do have the faith

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, and it’s keeping me up at night
Worried it’s not alright
Holding back things you don’t know
And it’s keeping me up at night
Worried it’s not alright
You’re not gonna like where this goes, no

[Chorus]
And they’ll tell you I don’t care anymore
And I hope you’ll know that’s a lie
'Cause I’ve found what I have been waiting for
But to get there means crossing a line
So I’m crossing a line
