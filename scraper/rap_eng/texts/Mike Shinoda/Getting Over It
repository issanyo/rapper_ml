[Intro]
Where'd you go
I miss you so
Seems like it's been forever
Since you've been gone

[Verse 1]
Now I
Never knew that I was hurting, but in fact
Every time I took a her in it was the burner in the back
But if that burner was the cause of all the pain
Then I'll burn her on that burner 'til I'm falling into flames
I've got a heart still stuffed up in a bag
While protected by the clarity that nothing ever lasts
I'll keep moving and I'll truck it like I'm bad
'Cause the scars never heal if you keep fucking with the scabs
She's the heroin, I'm something like a addict
But I've had it, this is rehab, I'm breaking off the habit And you can laugh like I'm never gonna make it
But the hard part was leaving in the first place so face it
I'm never coming back, you can take a last peeping
Every little picture that we never took and that's me
The one that always tried to make things better
But you would never let me do it or comply with ever

[Hook]
And I'm better, and know that it's your loss
'Cause you never really gave me the chance
To treat you like a queen with respect and dignity like I would've
But I wanna say thanks in advance
For giving me the opportunity to be with someone that cares
And I just wanna share one more fact
And that's if I could've then I would've just taken it all back
And given us a happier past

[Verse 2]
I can't believe it
You always were conceiving of assumptions that I'm cheating on you
When I've been thinking of the day that I was so depressed
'Cause you where kissing on another dude, it's such a mess
I wouldn't listen, all I want is to be truly thought of
As something more than a guy that got a little caught up
In such a whore, but I'll never do this shit again
You came and ruined it for me when it was innocent
I never knew that this was something that I would regret
And now I'm chasing every memory that's in effect
I'll come and break 'em in the face of you and if you cry
I'm never falling for that shit again so you decide
'Cause I ain't falling

[Hook]
And I'm better, and know that it's your loss
'Cause you never really gave me the chance
To treat you like a queen with respect and dignity like I would've
But I wanna say thanks in advance
For giving me the opportunity to be with someone that cares
And I just wanna share one more fact
And that's if I could've then I would've just taken it all back
And given us a happier past

[Verse 3]
And this is harder then it may appear
I always thought getting over it was plain and clear
I'm always caught up in the middle of another fight
I'm too tired to be caught up in another fight
I felt wired but I never thought of fucking up
I stuck it out with you through thick and thin and nothing but
There's nothing I would do to make it all enough for you
And you're so beautiful but all I need is something new
Just something new 'cause I never wanna be the guy
Holding you back from achieving everything and I
Wrote it in black, and I'd rather keep away from another new face, this is love but the colors soon fade

[Hook]
And I'm better, and know that it's your loss
'Cause you never really gave me the chance
To treat you like a queen with respect and dignity like I would've
But I wanna say thanks in advance
For giving me the opportunity to be with someone that cares
And I just wanna share one more fact
And that's if I could've then I would've just taken it all back
And given us a happier past

[Outro]
It was easy when I never really cared
It was easy when I never really cared
It was easy when I never really cared
So I'll pretend that I just don't care
It was easy when I never really cared
It was easy when I never really cared
It was easy when I never really cared
So I'll pretend that I just don't care
It was easy when I never really cared
It was easy when I never really cared
It was easy when I never really cared so
I'll pretend that I just don't care
It was easy when I never really cared
It was easy when I never really cared
It was easy when I never really cared so
I'll pretend that I just don't care
