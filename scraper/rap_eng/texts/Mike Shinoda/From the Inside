[Verse 1: Chester Bennington & Mike Shinoda]
I don't know who to trust, no surprise
Everyone feels so far away from me
Heavy thoughts sift through dust and the lies

[Pre-Chorus: Mike Shinoda]
Trying not to break, but I'm so tired of this deceit
Every time I try to make myself get back up on my feet
All I ever think about is this, all the tiring time between
And how trying to put my trust in you
Just takes so much out of me

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
(I) Take everything from the inside
And throw it all away
'Cause I swear, for the last time
I won't trust myself with you

[Verse 2: Chester & Mike Shinoda]
Tension is building inside, steadily
Everyone feels so far away from me
Heavy thoughts forcing their way out of me

[Pre-Chorus: Mike Shinoda]
Trying not to break, but I'm so tired of this deceit
Every time I try to make myself get back up on my feet
All I ever think about is this, all the tiring time between
And how trying to put my trust in you
Just takes so much out of me

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
(I) Take everything from the inside
And throw it all away
'Cause I swear, for the last time
I won't trust myself with you

[Bridge: Chester Bennington]
I won't waste myself on you
You
You
Waste myself on you
You
You

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
I'll take everything from the inside
And throw it all away
'Cause I swear, for the last time
I won't trust myself with you
Everything from the inside
And just throw it all away
'Cause I swear, for the last time
I won't trust myself with you
You
You
