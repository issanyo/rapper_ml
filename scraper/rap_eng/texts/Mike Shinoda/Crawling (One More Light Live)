[Verse 1: Chester Bennington]
There's something inside me that pulls beneath the surface
Consuming, confusing
This lack of self-control I fear is never ending
Controlling, I can't seem

[Pre-Chorus: Chester Bennington]
To find myself again
My walls are closing in
I've felt this way before
So insecure

[Chorus 1: Chester Bennington]
Crawling in my skin
These wounds they will not heal
Fear is how I fall
Confusing what is real

[Verse 2: Chester Bennington]
Discomfort endlessly has pulled itself upon me
Distracting, reacting
Against my will, I stand beside my own reflection
It's haunting how I can't seem

[Pre-Chorus: Chester Bennington]
To find myself again
My walls are closing in
I've felt this way before
So insecure

[Chorus 2: Chester Bennington]
Crawling in my skin
These wounds they will not heal
Fear is how I fall
Confusing what is real
Crawling in my skin
These wounds they will not heal
Fear is how I fall
Confusing, confusing what is real
