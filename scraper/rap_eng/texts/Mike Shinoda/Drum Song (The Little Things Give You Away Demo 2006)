[Chorus]
The little things give you away
The little things give you away
The little things give you away

[Pre-Chorus]
You don't believe in me, do you?
I mean nothing to you
The little things give you away
Don't even care what your breaking
And I'm not mistaken

[Chorus]
The little things give you away
The little things give you away
The little things give you away

You don't believe in me, do you?
I mean nothing to you
The little things give you away
Don't even care what your breaking
And I'm not mistaking
The little things give you away

[Chorus]
The little things give you away
The little things give you away
The little things give you away
