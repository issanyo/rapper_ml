[Verse 1: Mike Shinoda]
Part of me won't go away
Everyday, reminded how much I hate it
Weighed it against the consequences
Can't live without it, so itâ€˜s senseless

Wanna cut it out of my soul
And just live with the gaping hole
Take control of my life and wash out all the burnt taste
I made the problems in the first place

Hang my head low 'cause it's part of me
You hardly see right next to the heart of me
Hurting me, wounds soon scar
New cuts cover where the old ones are

And now I'm sick of this
I can't stand the sandpaper thoughts that grate on my sanity
I rather not even be
Than the man that's staring in the mirror through me

[Pre-Chorus: Mike Shinoda]
Cut myself free willingly, stop just what's killing me!
Cut myself free willingly, stop just what's killing me!
Cut myself free willingly, stop just what's killing me!
Cut myself free willingly, stop just what's killing me!

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
I feel it everyday
I feel I made my way
I feel it swell up inside
Swell up inside, swallowing me

[Verse 2: Mike Shinoda]
(Freedom can be frightening if you've never felt it)

Once it's been dealt with
You feel like you've been touched by something angelic
And then melted down into a pool of peace
Cease to be the animal you used to be

Remove the broken parts you know were wrong
And feel the calm when the problem's all gone
And then you start to see another piece
Of yourself that you can't let be

Memories of the last fight to free yourself
Taken to the depths of the bottom of the well
And now you know you can choose
To lose the part in your heart where your insides bruise

You can live if you're willing to
Put a stop to just what's killing you!

[Pre-Chorus: Mike Shinoda]
Cut myself free willingly, stop just what's killing me!
Cut myself free willingly, stop just what's killing me!
Cut myself free willingly, stop just what's killing me!
Cut myself free willingly, stop just what's killing me!

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
I feel it everyday
I feel I made my way
I feel it swell up inside
Swell up inside, swallowing me

[Bridge: Chester Bennington & Mike Shinoda]
(Alive in me, inside of me
A part of me screams away silently
Alive in me, inside of me
A part of me screams away silently)

This part of me won't go away! (Alive in me, inside of me)
(A part of me screams away silently)
Part of me won't go away! (Alive in me, inside of me)
(A part of me screams away silently)

[Interlude: Mike Shinoda]
Everywhere I look around, I see how everything ought to be
Every time I see myself, there's always something wrong with me
Everywhere I look around, I see how everything ought to be
Every time I see myself, there's always something wrong with me

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
I feel it everyday
I feel I made my way
I feel it swell up inside
Swell up inside, swallowing me

I feel it everyday
I feel I made my way
I feel it swell up inside
Swell up inside, swallowing me

I feel it swell up inside
Swell up inside, swallowing me
I feel it swell up inside
Swell up inside, swallowing me
