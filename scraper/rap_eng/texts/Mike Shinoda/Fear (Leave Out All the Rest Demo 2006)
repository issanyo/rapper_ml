[Verse: Mike Shinoda]
Looked in the ocean, looked in the sea
Found her often watching for me
Left the door open, left the door wide
And she often kept it inside, oh

[Pre-Chorus: Mike Shinoda]

[Scat Rapping]

Don't trust
If you don't, then your fighting for what?

[Chorus: Mike Shinoda]
We're fighting for a place we can call home
Looking for a way not to be alone
We're fighting for a place we can call home
Looking for a way not to be alone
Not to be alone

[Interlude: Mike Shinoda]
Da-na-na, da-nana-na-na-nana-nana-na-na
Da-na-na, da-nana-na-na-nana-nana-na-na
Da-na-na, da-nana-na-na-nana-nana-na-na
Da-na-na, da-nana-na-na-nana-nana-na-na
Da-na-na-nana-na

[Chorus: Mike Shinoda]
We're fighting for a place we can call home
Looking for a way not to be alone
We're fighting for a place we can call home
Looking for a way not to be alone
Not to be alone
