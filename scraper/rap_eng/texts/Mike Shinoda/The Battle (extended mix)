(Intro)

Time’s up, time’s up
(Yeah) Hold up
(Alright, that’s all you got?)
Alright, Celph, you got 30 seconds, are you ready?
(Yeah)
Alright, Celph Titled, hit ‘em

(Verse 1: Celph Titled)
Yeah, listen, yo
These hungry rappers battle
Fora buck and some change
There really be kids starving
Give a fuck if it change
Shot raps, got that
You get signed, you might blow up
Release party in Iraq, you might blow up
I see you trying to think a few lines
You might get at me with
Slap happy with babies who born with crack in they cribs
Too much to cram under your oversized fitted
And the public school system failed you
Either you ignorant or you isn’t
Ain’t concerned with scuffing my sneakers
My demographic listening
But not too many rappers teaching
And I find a way to fill a hard drive up
With songs containing mainly: bitch, ho, shit fuck
Yo, you know what’s up
There’s some ill shit going on
So wrong, it’s not topics that I’ve really spoken on
I’m just like you, a kid who wants to rap
Get money, put an album out, mansion with a fountain spout
Out in the front yard, sidewalk leading to the street
Which leads me to speak, my speech reaches the whole world
And yet still, I’d rather rap about what I got or what I’ll do to you
If you disrespect, you guessed it, I’m shooting you
Who’s the true villain and who’s illing the mix tape
Gun shots ain’t really killing, who’s dying? It’s tough luck
Can’t figure out if I’m the problem or the world’s just fucked up
