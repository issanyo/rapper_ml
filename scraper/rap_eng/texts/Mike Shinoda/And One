[Verse 1: Chester Bennington]
Where should I start? Disjointed heart
I've got no commitment to my own flesh and blood
Left all alone, far from my home
No one to hear me, to heal my ill heart

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
I keep it locked up, inside

[Verse 2: Chester Bennington]
I cannot express to the point I've regressed
If anger's a gift, then I guess I've been blessed

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
I keep it locked up, inside
Keep my distance from your lies

[Interlude: Chester Bennington]
It's too late to love me, now
You have never shown me
It's too late to love me, now
You don't even know me

[Bridge 1: Mike Shinoda & Chester Bennington]
Breaking a part of my heart to find release
Taking you out of my blood to bring me peace
Breaking a part of my heart to find release
Taking you out of my blood to bring me peace

Breaking a part of my heart to find release (Break!)
Taking you out of my blood to bring me peace (Me!)
Breaking a part of my heart to find release (Down!)
Taking you out of my blood to bring me peace

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
Keep it locked up, inside
Keep my distance from your lies

[Bridge 2: Mike Shinoda & Chester Bennington]
Breaking a part of my heart to find release (Break!)
Taking you out of my blood to bring me peace (Me!)
Breaking a part of my heart to find release (Down!)
Taking you out of my blood to bring me peace

Breaking a part of my heart to find release
Taking you out of my blood to bring me peace
Breaking a part of my heart to find release
Taking you out of my blood to bring me peace

Keep my distance
Keep my distance
Keep my distance
Keep my distance

[Outro: Mike Shinoda]
Spit drips from the jaw of the witless witness
Cryptic colloquialisms shift your mid rift
Dog paddle through a bog of shadows and smog
With my thought catalog, analogue rap battle log

Keep my distance and fear resistance
Hurt by persistence, the twisted web of tangled lies
Strangles my hope to waste and numbs the taste
And I'm forced to face these hate crimes

Against the state of being
Feeling the weightlessness press me to the ceiling
Reeling around rooms, riding a bubble of sound
Tuned to the frequency making your chest shake
With every boom

Involuntary muscle contraction
Ignoring your neck's breaking, musical gas fume euphoria
The sound pounds to make the dead flush
To hand you a head rush with read thoughts and said stuff
