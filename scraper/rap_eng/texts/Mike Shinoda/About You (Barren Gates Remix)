[Intro]:
Even when it's not about you, about you
All of a sudden it's about you now, oh
Even when it's not about you, about you
All of a sudden it's about you, oh
Even when it's not about you, about you
All of a sudden it's about you now, oh
Even when it's not about you, about you
All of a sudden it's about you (about you, about you, about you, about you)

[Verse]:
This is that gather 'round it and wonder where I found it
This is that wake up make your agent have your tour re-routed
This is that drama comma pain and ainâ€™t no way around it
'Cause somehow still it's hard to know what I can say about it
I buckled up told myself to suck it up
I was scared to death to get up there and spill my fucking guts
I was saying pull your stupid self together buttercup
Get it crackin' 'Back in Black' until you have 'em 'Thunderstruck', but

[Chorus]:
Even when it's not about you, about you
All of a sudden it's about you now, oh
Even when it's not about you, about you
All of a sudden it's about you

[Drop]

[Verse 2]:
No, there's not a single thing that I can say
Not a single solitary, every meaning changes shape
Even when there's no connection back to you in any line
All of a sudden it's about you and it gets me every time, but
What the fuck is left to author anyway?
When I basically been writin' since the Raiders ran LA
I'm afraid that maybe I've said everything there is to say
Maybe I should make an exit while there're ways to get away

[Chorus]:
Even when it's not about you, about you
All of a sudden it's about you now, oh
Even when it's not about you, about you
All of a sudden it's about you

[Drop]
