[Pre-Chorus: Mark Wakefield and (Mike Shinoda)]
From the top to the bottom (Bottom to top, I stop)
At the core of the rotten (Stopping just what I thought)
But sun has escaped us (So, I'm fighting the sky)
And I'm far from my weightless (Thinking, "why did I try?")

From the top to the bottom (Bottom to top, I stop)
At the core of the rotten (Stopping just what I thought)
But sun has escaped us (So, I'm fighting the sky)
And I'm far from my weightless (Thinking, "why did I try?")

[Verse 1: Mike Shinoda]
From the thread to the needle, middle-to-end
When skies cock back and shock that which couldn't defend
The rain then sends dripping an acidic question
Forcefully, the power of suggestion

Then, with the eyes tightly shut, looking through the rust
And rot and dust, a spot of light floods the floor
And pours itself upon the world of pretend
Then the eyes ease open and it's dark again

[Pre-Chorus: Mark Wakefield and (Mike Shinoda)]
From the top to the bottom (Bottom to top, I stop)
At the core of the rotten (Stopping just what I thought)
But sun has escaped us (So, I'm fighting the sky)
And I'm far from my weightless (Thinking, "why did I try?")

From the top to the bottom (Bottom to top, I stop)
At the core of the rotten (Stopping just what I thought)
But sun has escaped us (So, I'm fighting the sky)
And I'm far from my weightless (Thinking, "why did I try?")

[Chorus: Mark Wakefield]
In a minute, you'll find me
Eyes burn me up
You say you'll never forget me
But the lies have piled up

[Verse 2: Mike Shinoda]
Moving all around, screaming of the ups and downs
Pollution manifested in perpetual sound
And as the wheels go 'round, the sunset creeps
Past the street lamps, cars, chain-links, and concrete

A window then grows and captures the eye
And cries out yellow light as it passes it by
A small black figure sits in front of a box
Inside a box of rock with the needles on top

Nothing stops in this land of the chain
When brains lose, not knowing they were part of the game
And then the insides grow, but the box stays the same
In shame, shovel up the pieces to the pain

You can try to hide yourself in the world of pretend
But when the paper's crumpled up, it can't be perfect again

[Pre-Chorus: Mark Wakefield and (Mike Shinoda)]
From the top to the bottom (Bottom to top, I stop)
At the core of the rotten (Stopping just what I thought)
But sun has escaped us (So, I'm fighting the sky)
And I'm far from my weightless (Thinking, "why did I try?")

From the top to the bottom (Bottom to top, I stop)
At the core of the rotten (Stopping just what I thought)
But sun has escaped us (So, I'm fighting the sky)
And I'm far from my weightless (Thinking, "why did I try?")

[Chorus: Mark Wakefield]
In a minute, you'll find me
Eyes burn me up
You say you'll never forget me
But the lies have piled up

[Bridge: Mike Shinoda]
Yeah, I got you caught in the act, you better step back
Telling me that I'm seeing right through you
Yeah, I got you caught in the act, you better step back
Telling me that I'm seeing right through you

Yeah, I got you caught in the act, you better step back
Telling me that I'm seeing right through you
Yeah, I got you caught in the act, you better step back
Telling me that I'm seeing right through you

Yeah, I got you caught in the act, you better step back
Telling me that I'm seeing right through you
Yeah, I got you caught in the act, you better step back
Telling me that I'm seeing right through you

Yeah, I got you caught in the act, you better step back
Telling me that I'm seeing right through you
Yeah, I got you caught in the act, you better step back
Telling me that I'm seeing right through you

[Chorus: Mark Wakefield]
In a minute, you'll find me
Eyes burn me up
You say you'll never forget me
But the lies have piled up

[Outro: Mark Wakefield]
In a minute, you'll find me
Eyes burn me up
You say you'll never forget me
But the lies keep piling up
