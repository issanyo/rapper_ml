[Verse 1: Mike Shinoda]
Come with me
Let me walk you through the world that I currently stay in
You can take a look around and tell me if I'm mistaken
You can meet and talk to everybody that I live with
Maybe you can tell me why everybody's so distant

Is it me or maybe, when I look around daily
I don't even know the people I can put my trust in, lately
People that I used to hang with, now they're acting so different
I'm still the same person, why doesn't anybody listen?

[Pre-Chorus: Mike]
Can somebody, please just explain to me
What happened to the way that we always said we'd be?
Right now, I don't know why I pushed
Through the pain that I got through, and I'm losing hope

[Chorus: Kenna]
Deafening voices, that frequency inside my head that says
"I'm going at it the hard way"
I focus, get everything inside out of my brain that claims
"I'm going at it the hard way"

[Verse 2: Mike]
Come with me
Let me walk you through the world that I currently live in
Not a thing is forgotten, not a thing is forgiven
Nobody can hold their own underneath the weight, but
Nobody can take the blame for their own mistakes, so

What do you do when somebody lets you down?
And you wanna say something
But you can't, 'cause they're not around
Inside, you think they know the extent of the pain
But they won't even admit that they were the one to blame

[Pre-Chorus: Mike]
Can somebody, please just explain to me
What happened to the way that we always said we'd be?
'Cause right now, I don't know why I pushed
Through the pain that I got through, and I'm losing hope

[Chorus: Kenna]
Deafening voices, that frequency inside my head that says
"I'm going at it the hard way"
I focus, get everything inside out of my brain that claims
"I'm going at it the hard way"

[Interlude: Kenna]
Voices, voices
In my head, in my head

[Bridge: Mike]
Can somebody, please just explain to me
What happened to the way that we always said we'd be?
Right now, I don't know why I pushed
Through the pain that I got through
And I'm losing hope, give me one reason not to

[Chorus: Kenna]
Voices, that frequency inside my head that says
"I'm going at it the hard way"
I focus, get everything inside out of my brain that claims
"I'm going at it the hard way"
