[Intro - Holly]
Where'd you go?
I miss you so
Seems like it's been forever
That you've been gone

[Verse 1 - Mike]
She said "Some days I feel like shit
Some days I wanna quit, and just be normal for a bit,"
I don't understand why you have to always be gone
I get along but the trips always feel so long
And, I find myself tryna stay by the phone
'Cause your voice always helps me when I feel so alone
But I feel like an idiot, workin' my day around the call
But when I pick up I don't have much to say so
I want you to know it's a little fucked up
That I'm stuck here waitin', at times debatin'
Tellin' you that I've had it with you and your career
Me and the rest of the family here singin' "Where'd you go?"

[Hook - Holly & Mike]
I miss you so
Seems like it's been forever
That you've been gone
Where'd you go?
I miss you so
Seems like it's been forever
That you've been gone
Please come back home

[Verse 2 - Mike]
Come back home
You know, a place where you used to live
Used to barbeque up burgers and ribs
Used to have a little party every Hallowe'en with candy by the pile
But now, you only stop by every once in a while, shit!
I find myself just fillin' my time
With anythin' to keep the thought of you from my mind
I'm doin' fine and I'm plannin' to keep it that way
You can call me if you find that you have somethin' to say
And I'll tell you, I want you to know it's a little fucked up
That I'm stuck here waitin', at times debatin'
Tellin' you that I've had it with you and your career
Me and the rest of the family here singin' "Where'd you go?"

[Hook - Holly & Mike]
I miss you so
Seems like it's been forever
That you've been gone
Where'd you go?
I miss you so
Seems like it's been forever
That you've been gone
Please come back home

[Bridge - Mike]
I want you to know it's a little fucked up
That I'm stuck here waitin', no longer debatin'
Tired of sittin' and hatin' and makin' these excuses
For why you're not around, and feelin' so useless
It seems one thing has been true all along
You don't really know what you got 'til it's gone
I guess I've had it with you and your career
When you come back I won't be here and you can sing it

[Hook - Holly & Mike]
Where'd you go?
I miss you so
Seems like it's been forever
That you've been gone
Where'd you go?
I miss you so
Seems like it's been forever
That you've been gone

[Outro - Holly (x5)]
Please come back home
