[Verse 1: Mike Shinoda]
There are just too many
Times that people
Have tried to look inside of me
Wondering what I think of you
And I protect you out of courtesy
Too many times that I’ve
Held on when I needed to push away
Afraid to say what was on my mind
Afraid to say what I need to say
Too many things that you’ve said about me when I’m not around
You think having the upper hand
Means you gotta keep puttin' me down
But I’ve had too many stand-offs with you
It’s about as much as I can stand
So I'm waiting until the upper hand is mine

[Chorus: Chester Bennington & Mike Shinoda]
One minute, you’re on top
(The next you’re not
Watch it drop)
Making your heart stop
(Just before you hit the floor)
One minute, you’re on top
(The next you’re not
Missed your shot)
Making your heart stop
(You think you won)
And then It's all gone

[Verse 2: Mike Shinoda]
So many people like me
Put so much trust in all your lies
So concerned with what you think
To just say what we feel inside
So many people like me
Walk on eggshells all day long
All I know is that all I want
Is to feel like I’m not stepped on
There are so many things you say
That make me feel you crossed the line
What goes up will surely fall
And I’m counting down the time
'Cause I’ve had so many stand-offs with you
It’s about as much as I can stand
So I’m waiting until the upper hand is mine

[Chorus: Chester Bennington & Mike Shinoda]
One minute, you’re on top
(The next you’re not
Watch it drop)
Making your heart stop
(Just before you hit the floor)
One minute, you’re on top
(The next you’re not
Missed your shot)
Making your heart stop
(You think you won)
And then It's all gone

[Refrain: Chester Bennington]
And then, it's all gone
And then, it's all gone
And then, it's all gone
Now it's all gone

[Bridge: Mike Shinoda]
I know I’ll never trust a single thing you say
You knew your lies would divide use, but you lied anyway
And all the lies have got you floating up above us all
But what goes up has got to fall

[Chorus: Chester Bennington & Mike Shinoda]
One minute, you’re on top
(The next you’re not
Watch it drop)
Making your heart stop
(Just before you hit the floor)
One minute, you’re on top
(The next you’re not
Missed your shot)
Making your heart stop
(You think you won)
And then It's all gone

[Outro: Chester Bennington]
And then, it's all gone
And then, it's all gone
And then, it's all gone
Now it's all gone
