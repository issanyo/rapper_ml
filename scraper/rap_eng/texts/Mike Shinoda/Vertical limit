Bridge :
Forfeit the game / Stop the talk show
Product of what / You're taught to know
Forfeit the game / Cause tomorrow
When it's all done / You reap what you sow

[verse thing]
You love the way I look at you
While taking pleasure in the awful things you put me through
You take away / if I give in
My life, my pride is broken

Chorus :
You like to think you're never wrong (You live what you learn)
You have to act like you're someone (You live what you learn)
You want someone to hurt like you (You live what you learn)
You want to share what you've been through
You live what you learn

[Verse thing 2]
You love the things I say I'll do
The way I'll hurt myself again just to get back at you
You take away / when I give in
My life, my pride is broken

Chorus :
You like to think you're never wrong (You live what you learn)
You have to act like you're someone (You live what you learn)
You want someone to hurt like you (You live what you learn)
You want to share what you've been through
You live what you learn

[Bridge] [x2]
Forfeit the game / Stop the talk show
Product of what / Your taught to know
Forfeit the game / Cause tomorrow
When it's all done / You reap what you sow



[Chorus]
You like to think you're never wrong (You live what you learn)
You have to act like you're someone (You live what you learn)
You want someone to hurt like you (You live what you learn)
You want to share what you've been through (You live what you learn)

[Chorus]
You like to think you're never wrong (Forfeit the game)
(You live what you learn)
You have to act like you're someone (Forfeit the game)
(You live what you learn)
You want someone to hurt like you (Forfeit the game)
(You live what you learn)
You want to share what you've been through
You live what you learn
