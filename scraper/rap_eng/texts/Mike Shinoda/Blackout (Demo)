[Verse: Chester Bennington]
A little bit acid rain
A little bit celebration
A little bit anarchy
A lack of motivation
It’s painted upon your face
Beautiful hallucination
You can’t get enough
You shake and shake and shake and never say

[Chrous: Chester Bennington]
No! You gotta get it inside
You push it back down! You push it back down!
Go! You say you got every right
Push it back down, blackout, blood in your eye
