[Verse 1]
I've got an aching head
Echoes and buzzing noises
I know the words we said
But wish I could've turned our voices down
This is not black and white
Only organized confusion
I'm just trying to get it right
And in spite of all I should've done

[Pre-Chorus]
I was not mad at you
I was not trying to tear you down
The words that I could've used
I was too scared to say out loud
If I cannot break your fall
I'll pick you up right off the ground
If you felt invisible, I won't let you feel that now

[Chorus]
Invisible, invisible
Invisible, invisible

[Verse 2]
Didn't get your way
And it's an empty feeling
You've got a lot to say
You just want to know you're being heard
But this is not black and white
There are no clear solutions
I'm just trying to get it right
And in spite of all I should've done

[Pre-Chorus]
I was not mad at you
I was not trying to tear you down
The words that I could've used
I was too scared to say out loud
If I cannot break your fall
I'll pick you up right off the ground
If you felt invisible, I won't let you feel that now

[Chorus]
Invisible (yeah), invisible
Invisible, invisible

[Bridge]
This is not black and white
There are no clear solutions
I'm just trying to get it right
And in spite of all I should've done

[Pre-Chorus]
I was not mad at you
I was not trying to tear you down
The words that I could've used
I was too scared to say out loud
If I cannot break your fall
I'll pick you up right off the ground
If you felt invisible, I won't let you feel that now

[Chorus]
Invisible, invisible
Invisible, invisible
Invisible, invisible
Invisible, invisible

[Outro]
You guys ready?
So we have a new album out, it is called One More Light
And as we're making an album, there are always certain songs that stand out to each of us
Umm, and kind of help define the course of the record
And for me, this was always, this was always one song
That I felt like, umm, I really wanted to save
That I didn't want people to hear until they heard the whole album
And that's why, that's why we put it first on the record
This is actually, uh, this is only the second time we've ever played it too
So you guys get a, get a second concert
