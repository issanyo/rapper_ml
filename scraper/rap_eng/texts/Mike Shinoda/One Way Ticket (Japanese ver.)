[Verse 1]
Remember that night
I had to leave you
You said it's alright
And I believed you
You know I'm no good
No good at goodbyes
No good without you
Better by your side

[Pre-Chorus]
Wish I could be there with you
I'm feeling lost without you

[Chorus 1]
In this empty bed
Where I'm all alone
I've been such a mess
Need a one way ticket

Anywhere you are
Is where I want to go
You are my address
I don't care how I get it
I need a one way ticket
Home

[Verse 2]
When you're not with me
These days are boring
Wish it were easy
Like Sunday morning
When I'd be waking up with you
Only doing those things we wanna do
My heart is anywhere you go
When I'm next to you I'm home

[Pre-Chorus]
Wish I could be there with you
I'm feeling lost without you

[Chorus 1]
In this empty bed
Where I'm all alone
I've been such a mess
Need a one way ticket

Anywhere you are
Is where I want to go
You are my address
I don't care how I get it
I need a one way ticket
Home

[Chorus 2]
In this empty bed
Where I'm all alone
I've been such a mess

さよならを言えばきっと
君は僕を忘れてしまうから
失えば2度目はない
気づいたんだ

I don't care how I get it
I need a one way ticket
