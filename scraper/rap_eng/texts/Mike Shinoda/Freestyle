DJ Vice Intro:

I'm serious, it can't get no bigger than this
The hungry Mike Shinoda of Linkin Park
Putting it down with DJ Vice
Let 'em know Mike

Mike Shinoda:

Let it begin with the stutter of light and short circuits
Driven to give minimal life more purpose
Behind closed curtains
I don't even exist
This magic's created in the mirrors and the mist
It's Mike Shinoda and DJ Vice at the same time
Rhymes like rain that trickle down your main line
And flood your streets over a high tech beat
To sneak tuneful treats into turntable techniques
I don't sleep to dream, I sleep to build stamina
Energy to planet advance, get your camera
With these rhymes, ya better seal off the parameter
One line, and you're swimming off the south coast of Canada
This is the sound of me and Vice in the cut
Roughin' it up just in case you might get tough
Nitrogen under my breath just to light things up
And DNA in every line so it's live enough
