(And he never lies)......
(And he never lies)......
Uh.....yea

(Verse 1)
He just sits, and watches the people in the boxes
Everything he sees he absorbs and adopts it
He mimics and he mocks it
Really hates the box, but he can't remember how to stop it
Uh! So he continues to watch it
Open that and then give him something that he can box with
Or how to locksmith
See the box is, locked in a box, ain't got the combination to unlock it
Thats why he wa-tches, scared to look away
Cause at that moment, it might show him
What to take off the locks with
So he chained hisself to the box, took a lock, and then he locked it
Swallowed the combination and then forgot it
As the doctors jot it all down with they pens and pencils
The same ones that took away his voice
And just left his Instrumental like that

(Hook)
(And he never lies) He never lies, he never lies, uh
(And he never lies) He never lies, he never lies, no
(And he never lies) He never lies.......
(Cause he never said anything at all)

(Verse 2)
He just sits, and listens to the people in the boxes
Everything he hears, he absorbs and adopts it
Anything not coming out the box, he blocks it
See he loves the box and hope they never stop it
Anything the box tell him to do
He does it anything it tell him to get
He shops and he cops it
He protects the box, locks it inna box when he goes to sleep, but he never sleeps
Cause he stays up to watch it
Scared to look away
Cause at that moment, it might get stolen and thats the last of the boxes
So he chained hisself to the box, took a lock, and then he locked it
Swallowed the combination and forgot it
As the doctors jot it all down with they pens and pencils
The same ones that took away his voice
And just left his Instrumental like that

(Bridge)x2
And you can't tell me just who you are?
You buy new clothes just to hide those scars
You built that roof just to hide those stars
Now you can't take it back to the start

(Hook)

(Bridge) fades.....
