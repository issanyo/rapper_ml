[Intro: Chester Bennington]
No control, no surprise
Tossed the keys to the kingdom down that hole in my eye
I'm my own casualty
I fuck up everything I see, fighting in futility

[Verse 1: Mike Shinoda & Chester Bennington]
We start the final war, tell me what's worth fighting for
When we know there's nothing more
We take the hand or fist just to sell ourselves for this
The path we least resist

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
No control, no surprise
Tossed the keys to the kingdom down that hole in my eye
I'm my own casualty
I fuck up everything I see, fighting in futility

[Verse 2: Mike Shinoda]
I give you what you came for, this is not the same though
Got a different method, but I still can bring the pain, so
Y'all all get that same flow, I got that insane flow
High as y'all can get, you're never really in my range though
Yes, I'm half Anglo, half-fried panko
All prime-time rhymer, let the bass bang low
All you fucking lames go aiming at my name, know
Careful what you shoot because you might hit what you aim for
Careful what you shoot because you might hit what you aim for

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
No control, no surprise
Tossed the keys to the kingdom down that hole in my eye
I'm my own casualty
I fuck up everything I see, fighting in futility

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
No control, no surprise
Tossed the keys to the kingdom down that hole in my eye
I'm my own casualty
I'm my own casualty

[Outro: Mike Shinoda]
"I'm not allowed to say certain things! AHH!"
Try and do... Try and do the other thing, real quick
