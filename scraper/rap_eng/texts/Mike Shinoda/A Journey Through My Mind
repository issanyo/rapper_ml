[Verse 1: Zettabyte]

Life hasn't been the same
Since I died
Tryna climb outta this hole
Got my hands tied
Can't see Luna with my
Own eyes

Experiencing interlunation
Invisible answer complication
Can't seem to solve
This confrontation
Even when I'm
On one nation

Under God, "It's my fault."
To the mirror, as I nod
Evade my feelings
Somersault
Filling my wounds with
More salt
Oh God please just
Take me back
I'm in pain, it's the only
Thing I feel that's real
Peace I've not attained
I'm hooked on novacane

(I'll get over this
In a Rover its
Gonna be fine
Like an aged wine
Take a little break and
I will be alright
Everything's much brighter
In the summertime
Feeling kinda sick, it must be
A bug
Feel it in my heart, it must be
The love
But I'll just mix the sugar
And the Borax
It's the only way that I really
Know how to interact)

Now my plan is to attack
Will it leave my heart intact?
I don't really know, but I gotta
Find out where I'm at
Find my home on the map
Fly to it

Even though there's nothing
But hate
I'm blind to it

Even though there's nothing
But hate
I'm blind to it

Even though there's nothing
But hate
I'm blind to it

Even though there's nothing
But hate
I'm blind to it

[Hook: Mike Shinoda]

'Cause I'm tired of the fear
That I can't control this

I'm tired of feeling like every
Next steps hopeless

Tired of being scare that I'll
Build my break apart

I don't wanna know the end
All I want is a Place to Start

[Verse 2: Zettabyte]

Now I'm feeling invincible
Ba Sing Se, that's my principal
No Dai Li, circle small
Since I'm full
Highly doubt me?
Look at these wins I pull
Now think about it I'm out it
I speak from my Soul
Now think about it I'm out it
There's no interval
Push me outta the ride
That's when I roll
Lyrically inject venom
Now watch the toll

Rise up, rise up
Like the sun rise up
So hot, so hot
Need a sun visor
I got Soul
Got music on my side, yeah
I got Soul
Got music on my side, yeah

Rise up, rise up
Like the sun rise up
So hot, so hot
Need a sun visor
I got Soul
Got music on my side, yeah
I got Soul
I got the Messiah
