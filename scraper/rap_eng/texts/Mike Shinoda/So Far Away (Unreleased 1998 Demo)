[Verse 1: Mike Shinoda]
Save me now
From this mess that I've created
All the souls have gone
And I'm stranded here with doubt and fear alone

Tell me how
I'm in fault for all this madness
I don't know what's wrong
But I cannot help but try to push it

[Chorus: Mike Shinoda & Chester Bennington]
So far away
(In so deep and inside of me)
So hard to say
(I don't want to say it, anyway)

[Verse 2: Mike Shinoda]
Save me now
I'm the mess I have created
And my soul has gone
For some reason, all I do is push it

[Chorus: Mike Shinoda & Chester Bennington]
So far away
(In so deep and inside of me)
So hard to say
(I don't want to say it, anyway)
So far away

[Chorus: Mike Shinoda & Chester Bennington]
It's so far away
(In so deep and inside of me)
So hard to say
(I don't want to say it, anyway)

So far away
(In so deep and inside of me)
So hard to say
(I don't want to say it, anyway)
