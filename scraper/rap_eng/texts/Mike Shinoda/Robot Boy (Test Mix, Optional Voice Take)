[Verse 1]
You say you're not gonna fight
'Cause no one will fight for you
'Cause you think there's not enough love
And no one to give it to

And you say that faith is a lie
And fear is your only truth
And you're sure that everyone else
Is feeling the way you do

[Verse 2]
You say you've hurt for so long
That pain isn't something new
But, don't think the things that they've done
Predict what you're going to do

The truth is that trust is a gift
It's something we all can lose
So hold on, it's not where it goes
It's where it can lead you to

[Chorus]
Hold on, it's not where it goes
It's where it can lead you to
Hold on, it's not where it goes
It's where it can lead you to

Hold on, it's not where it goes
It's where it can lead you to
Hold on, it's not where it goes
It's where it can lead you to
