[Pre-Chorus: Chester Bennington & Mike Shinoda]
From the top to the bottom (Bottom to top, I stop)
At the core, I've forgotten (In the middle of my thoughts)
Taken far from my safety (Saw a light in the sky)
The sun will escape me (So why did I try?)

From the top to the bottom (Bottom to top, I stop)
At the core, I've forgotten (In the middle of my thoughts)
Taken far from my safety (Saw a light in the sky)
The sun will escape me (So why do I try?)

[Verse 1: Mike Shinoda]
From the thread to the needle, middle to end
When skies cock back and shock that which couldn't defend
The rain then sends dripping an acidic question
Forcefully, the power of suggestion

Then with the eyes tightly shut
Looking through the rust and rot and dust
A spot of light floods the floor
And pours itself upon the world of pretend
And the eyes ease open and it's dark again

[Pre-Chorus: Chester Bennington & Mike Shinoda]
From the top to the bottom (Bottom to top, I stop)
At the core, I've forgotten (In the middle of my thoughts)
Taken far from my safety (Saw a light in the sky)
The sun will escape me (So why did I try?)

From the top to the bottom (Bottom to top, I stop)
At the core, I've forgotten (In the middle of my thoughts)
Taken far from my safety (Saw a light in the sky)
The sun will escape me (So why do I try?)

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
In a minute, you'll find me
Eyes burn me up
You say you'll never forgive me
But the lies have piled up

[Verse 2: Mike Shinoda]
Moving all around, screaming of the ups and downs
Pollution manifested in perpetual sound
And as the wheels go round and the sunset creeps
Past the street lamps, cars, chain-link, and concrete

A window then grows and catches the eye
Cries out a yellow light as it passes it by
A small black figure sits in front of a box
Inside a box of rock with the needles on top

Nothing stops in this land of the pain
The sane lose not knowing they were part of the game
And then the insides change, the box stays the same
The shame, shovel up the pieces of the pain
You can try to hide yourself in this world of pretend
But when the paper's crumpled up, it can't be perfect again

[Pre-Chorus: Chester Bennington & Mike Shinoda]
From the top to the bottom (Bottom to top, I stop)
At the core, I've forgotten (In the middle of my thoughts)
Taken far from my safety (Saw a light in the sky)
The sun will escape me (So why did I try?)

From the top to the bottom (Bottom to top, I stop)
At the core, I've forgotten (In the middle of my thoughts)
Taken far from my safety (Saw a light in the sky)
The sun will escape me (So why do I try?)

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
In a minute, you'll find me
Eyes burn me up
You say you'll never forgive me
But the lies have piled up

[Bridge: Mike Shinoda & Chester Bennington]
Now I got you caught in the act, you better step back
I'm telling you that I see it right through you
Now I got you caught in the act, you better step back
I'm telling you that I see it right through you

Now I got you caught in the act, you better step back
I'm telling you that I see it right through you
Now I got you caught in the act, you better step back
I'm telling you that I see it right through you

(Are you afraid of you?)
Now I got you got in the act, you better step back
I'm telling you that I see it right through you
(Afraid of you?)
Now I got you got in the act, you better step back
I'm telling you that I see it right through you

(Are you afraid of you?)
Now I got you got in the act, you better step back
I'm telling you that I see it right through you
(Afraid of you?)
Now I got you got in the act, you better step back
I'm telling you that I see it right through you

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
In a minute, you'll find me
Eyes burn me up
You say you'll never forgive me
But the lies have piled up

[Outro: Mike Shinoda]
In a minute, you'll find me
Eyes burn me up
You say you'll never forgive me
But the lies have piled up
