[Intro: Chester Bennington]
One, two
One, two, thank you

[Verse 1: Chester Bennington]
There's no peace, only war
Victory decides who's wrong or right
It will not cease, only grow
You better be prepared to fight

[Pre-Chorus: Chester Bennington]
And it will not apologize
For laying down your life

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
War

[Verse 2]
There's no pain, it will spare
Fear has become your only right
And once you're lost, in your despair
Forever black eternal night

[Pre-Chorus: Chester Bennington]
And it will not apologize
For laying down your life

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
War, destroyer
War, destroyer

[Bridge: Chester Bennington]
It needs no side to justify
Laying down your life

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
War, destroyer
War
