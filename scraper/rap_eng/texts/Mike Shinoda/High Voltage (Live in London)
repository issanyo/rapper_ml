[Intro: Chester Bennington & Mike Shinoda]
Our 12,500 closest friends in London are here, tonight
Making this such a beautiful sight to see
We're gonna play a- We're pleased
We're gonna play a b-side for you
Something that's not on the album
It made it onto the b-side of One Step Closer here, in the UK
Check it out, it's High Voltage

[Verse 1: Mike]
I've been diggin' into crates, ever since I was living in space
Before the rat race, before monkeys had human traits
I mastered numerology and big bang theology
Performed lobotomies with telekinetic psychology

Invented the mic so I could start blessing it
Chin-checking kids to make my point like an impressionist
Many men have tried to shake us
But I twist mic cords in double helixes and show you what I'm made of

I buckle knees like leg braces
Cast a spell of instrumentalness on all of these MC's who hate us
(So you can try on) Leave you without a shoulder to cry on
From now to infinity, let icons be bygones

I firebomb, ghostly notes haunt this
I tried threats, but moved on to a promise
I stomp shit, with or without an accomplice
Run the gauntlet with whoever that wants this

[Chorus: Mike & Chester]
(High voltage) This is the unforgettable sound
(High voltage) Bringing you up and taking you down
(High voltage) Coming at you from every side
(High voltage) Making the rhythm and rhyme collide

[Verse 2: Mike]
(Akira) I put a kick in the backbones of clones with microphones
Never satisfy my rhyme jones
Spraying bright day over what you might say
My blood type's Krylon, technicolor type A

On highways, bright with road rage
Pages of wind in cages of tin that bounce all around
(Surround sound) Devouring the scene
Subliminal gangrene paintings, overall the same thing

Sing-song karaoke copy bullshit
Break bones verbally with sticks-and-stone tactics
Fourth dimension combat convention
Write rhymes at ease while the track stands at attention

Meant to put you away, with a pencil pistol official
Sixteen-line, the rhyme missile
While you risk your all, I pick out all your flaws
Spittin' rah blah blah blah, you can say you saw

[Chorus: Mike & Chester]
(High voltage) This is the unforgettable sound
(High voltage) Bringing you up and taking you down
(High voltage) Coming at you from every side
(High voltage) Making the rhythm and rhyme collide

(High voltage) This is the unforgettable sound
(High voltage) Bringing you up and taking you down
(High voltage) Coming at you from every side
(High voltage) Making the rhythm and rhyme collide

[Interlude: Chester]
Sometimes...
Sometimes...

[Bridge: Chester]
Sometimes, I feel like a prophet
Misunderstood, under the gun like a new disease
Sometimes, I feel like a prophet
Misunderstood, under the gun like a new disease

[Chorus: Mike & Chester]
(It's high voltage) This is the unforgettable sound
(High voltage) Bringing you up and taking you down
(High voltage) Coming at you from every side
(High voltage) Making the rhythm and rhyme collide

(High voltage) This is the unforgettable sound
(High voltage) Bringing you up and taking you down
(High voltage) Coming at you from every side
(High voltage) Yo everybody, put 'em up like this!

(High voltage) This is the unforgettable sound
(High voltage) Bringing you up and taking you down
(High voltage) Coming at you from every side
(High voltage) Making the rhythm and rhyme collide

(High voltage) This is the unforgettable sound
(High voltage) Bringing you up and taking you down
(High voltage) Coming at you from every side
(High voltage) Making the rhythm and rhyme collide

[Outro: Mike & Chester]
