[Verse 1]
Weep not for roads untraveled
Weep not for paths left alone
Cause beyond every bend is a long blinding end
It's the worst kind of pain I've known

[Verse 2]
Give up your heart left broken
And let that mistake pass on
Cause the love that you lost wasn't worth what it cost
And in time, you'll be glad it's gone

Whoa (x20)

[Verse 3 - Bun B]
Well, it's our life and it's our time, and it's our place and it's our choice
These are all our thoughts with our views, out of our minds with our voice
It's our oath to this generation, they call it fake, we call it fate
You see, they don't like us or understand us, and they just hope we all fall away
But we won't stop, and we won't quit, and we won't settle for what they give
And we'll keep on standin', keep on fightin' no backin' down, that's how we're livin'
Our minds are made up and we're focused no more believin' what we've been told
Cause our bags are packed, there's no turnin' back, we walk alone on these winding roads

[Verse 4]
Weep not for roads untraveled
Weep not for sights unseen
May your love never end and if you need a friend
There's a seat here alongside me

Whoa (x20)

May your love never end and if you need a friend
There's a seat here alongside me
