Darker Than Blood

[Verse 1: Chester Bennington]
Don't you hold your breath 'cause I'm not coming down
The battlefields have left me only scars
And floating in the dark, I'm swimming in the sound
Of voices that should never been apart

[Chorus: Chester Bennington
Darker than the blood (Darker than the blood)
Higher than the sun (Higher than the sun)
This is not the end (This is not the end)
You are not the only one (You are not the only one)



A LIGHT THAT NEVER COMES

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
The nights go on
Waiting for a light that never comes
I chase the sun
Waiting for a light that never comes
Oh, oh, oh
Waiting for a light that never comes
