[Verse 1: Mike Shinoda]
She can't hide, no matter how hard she tries
Her secret disguise behind the lies
And at night, she cries away her pride
With eyes shut tight, staring at her inside

All her friends know why she can't sleep at night
All her family asking if she's alright
All she wants to do is get rid of this hell
Well, all she's gotta do is stop kidding herself

[Pre-Chorus: Mike Shinoda & Chester Bennington]
She can only fool herself for so long
She can only fool herself for so long
She can only fool herself for so long
(I'm too weak to face me!) She can only fool herself

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
I never know just why you run
So far away, far away from me
I never know just why you run
So far away, far away from me

[Verse 2: Mike Shinoda]
When it comes to how to live his life, he can't be told
Says he's got it all under control
Thinks he knows it's not a problem he's stuck with
But in reality, it'd be a problem to just quit

An addict and he can't hold the reigns
The pain is worse 'cause his friends have it the same
Tries to slow down the problem he's got
But can't get off the carousel until he makes it stop

[Pre-Chorus: Mike Shinoda & Chester Bennington]
He can only fool himself for so long
He can only fool himself for so long
He can only fool himself for so long
(I'm too weak to face me!) He can only fool himself

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
I never know just why you run
So far away, far away from me
I never know just why you run
So far away, far away from me

[Bridge: Mike Shinoda]
Fly with me, under the wings I gave you
Try to be closer to me and I'll save you
Fly with me, under the wings I gave you
Try to be closer to me and I'll save you

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
I never know just why you run
So far away, far away from me
I never know just why you run
So far away, far away from me

I never know just why you run
So far away, far away from me
I never know just why you run
So far away, far away from me
