[Intro: Nathan]
Hi my name is Nathan
And I love my mommy
I miss her a lot
Rest in peace mommy

[Verse 1: Benny Boy]
I don't know what you thought but this dude's got potential
I'll keep you suspenseful just using a pencil
I'll use all the lead to move and affect you
Move you through dude's moods and direct you
Through his whole lifetime, knew that he might find
Split personalities up in his right mind
Just at the right time, used a new lifeline
Mad at the world so he started to write rhymes
Stress came along, he would sketch a new song
His mom's on his charm, and it's clinched in his palm
He's depressed that she's gone
And to even the odds, he's just screaming at God that he's wrong
And he doesn't understand the reason for this punishment
Jealous of the other kids, hugging on their mother it's
Tougher just because of his, sister and his brother is
Little kids, they don't get why they're raised motherless
Asking him questions with fear all inside
And the dude's choking up with some tears in his eyes
He just smears them and cries
But when people are near, he's just forced to appear that he's fine
He done cried so much that it hurts him to breath
But he takes a deep breath and spit words to the beat
It's disturbing to see, in the story
The person dispersing the verses is me

[Interlude: Brianna]
Hi my name is Brianna
I know a lot of things now
I know you're my mommy
I know you love me
I know you're in heaven
You're an angel now
I miss you a lot
I can't wait to see you
You're so pretty
I love and miss you
Rest in peace mommy

[Verse 2: Benny Boy]
Usually before verse 2 I would end it
But if I don't finish this through I'll regret it
I don't mean to have the whole mood sympathetic
But if I don't tell the story then who's gonna tell it
I could care less if there's people making fun of me
Speak from your heart, that's how she raised her son to be
Journey through my mind if you really want to come with me
It gets deeper, the 1st verse was just a summary
None of these people ever been in my position
Trying to talk to God but all he seems to do is listen
Instead of telling me, he leaves a trail of clues to follow
But I need the answer now, cause I ain't guarnteed tomorrow
Been anticipating when this chapter is done
And I haven't been eating right these past couple months
And I been daydreaming about the choir at the funeral
I even hear it now, that's what a family death'll do to you
And since then, I've been honoring my mama
I give respect to her because my papa didn't bother
He should of stuck around and he ought of been a father
But he didn't so he just made all of us just stronger
My mama gave me a brother and a sister
They're my motivation to continue with the scripture
Pecked her on the forehead the last time I kissed her
And now I kiss her picture and cry because I miss her
Picture that kid emotionally hurt
And picture her coming home from a tired day at work
Picture how she kisses the cheek of her husband
Then she hugs her children just to show them that she loves them
Picture a mom holds a family together
And this tragedy affects them drastically forever
But the family'll never forget the part she played
But this is all a dream cause I can feel it start to fade
The dream gets weary and I wake up on my bed
And I'm so confused so I put my hand upon my head
But then I realize that there's something in my palm
It's a dog tag chain with my mama on the charm
And down the halls I can hear Nathan and Brianna
Waking up there daddy cause they're screaming for their mama
So the whole dream makes sense to me
So I'll see you when I see mom, Rest In Peace
