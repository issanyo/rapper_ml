[Intro: Mos Def]
Won't be long 'til everybody knows

[Verse 1: Chester Bennington]
I've seen her smiling
The sunlight shining for her now
She couldn't stay here
She knows you won't let her down

[Pre-Chorus: Chester Bennington]
You know she couldn't stay here with you
You know she had to go
Even though she couldn't stay here with you
You know you're not alone

[Chorus: Mike Shinoda & Mos Def]
No matter what you think you did wrong
(Won't be long 'til everybody knows)
She knew she had to go all along
(Won't be long 'til everybody knows)

No matter what you think you did wrong
(Won't be long 'til everybody knows)
She knew she had to go all along
(Won't be long 'til everybody knows)

[Verse 2: Chester Bennington]
I've seen her shining
The sunlight's crying for her now
She wouldn't stay here
She knows you won't let her down

[Pre-Chorus: Chester Bennington]
You know she couldn't stay here with you
You know she had to go
Even though she couldn't stay here with you
You know you're not alone

[Chorus: Mike Shinoda & Mos Def]
No matter what you think you did wrong
(Won't be long 'til everybody knows)
She knew she had to go all along
(Won't be long 'til everybody knows)

No matter what you think you did wrong
(Won't be long 'til everybody knows)
She knew she had to go all along
(Won't be long 'til everybody knows)

[Bridge: Mos Def]
Won't be long 'til everybody knows
Won't be long 'til everybody knows
Won't be long 'til everybody knows
Won't be long 'til everybody knows

[Chorus: Mike Shinoda & Mos Def]
No matter what you think you did wrong
(Won't be long 'til everybody knows)
She knew she had to go all along
(Won't be long 'til everybody knows)

No matter what you think you did wrong
(Won't be long 'til everybody knows)
She knew she had to go all along
(Won't be long 'til everybody knows)

[Outro: Mike Shinoda & Chester Bennington]
No matter what you think you did wrong
(You know she couldn't stay here with you)
She knew she had to go all along
(You know she had to go)

No matter what you think you did wrong
(You know she couldn't stay here with you)
She knew she had to go all along
(You know she had to go)

No matter what you think you did wrong
(You know she couldn't stay here with you)
She knew she had to go all along
(You know she had to go)

No matter what you think you did wrong
(You know she couldn't stay here with you)
She knew she had to go all along
(You know she had to go)

No matter what you think you did wrong
(You know she couldn't stay here with you)
She knew she had to go all along
(You know she had to go)

No matter what you think you did wrong
(You know she couldn't stay here with you)
