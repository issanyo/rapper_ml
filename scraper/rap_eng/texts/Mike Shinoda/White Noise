[Verse 1]
You've been faking it all this time
You left my trust on the firing line
As the promises break, the only mistakes -
Giving you what was mine
Your words are clear but their meaning's gone
The notes are right but the tuning's wrong
And when you tell me again that I should give in
I can only take it so long (long, long, long)

[Chorus]
RAH!
You're terrified, terrified
You'd rather throw it all away, all away, all away!
You're terrified, terrified
You'd rather throw it all away!

[Verse 2]
Fear is dancing inside your lies
Exposing secrets that you've disguised
And I'm biting my tongue as you become
Victim of a compromise
Cause I know who you really are
Not a scratch where you pretend you're scarred
And it's time that you seek the truth without me
I can only get you so far (far, far, far)

[Chorus]
RAH!
You're terrified, terrified
You'd rather throw it all away, all away, all away!
You're terrified, terrified
You'd rather throw it all away!

[Instrumental + Bridge]
Throw it all away, all away, way!
Throw it all away, all away, all away, way! (x3)
Throw it all away, all aâ€”!

[Chorus]
RAH!
You're terrified, terrified
You'd rather throw it all away, all away, all away!
You're terrified, terrified
You'd rather throw it all away!

[Outro]
All away!
You're terrified, terrified
You'd rather throw it all away, all away, all away!
You're terrified, terrified
You'd rather throw it all away!
