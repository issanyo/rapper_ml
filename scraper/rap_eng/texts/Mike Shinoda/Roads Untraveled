[Verse 1: Mike Shinoda]
Weep not for roads untraveled
Weep not for paths left lone
'Cause beyond every bend is a long blinding end
It's the worst kind of pain I've known

[Verse 2: Mike Shinoda & Chester Bennington]
Give up your heart, left broken
And let that mistake pass on
'Cause the love that you lost wasn't worth what it cost
And in time, you'll be glad it's gone

[Refrain: Chester Bennington]
Whoa-oh, whoa-oh-oh-oh
Whoa-oh, whoa-oh-oh-oh
Whoa-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
Whoa-oh, oh-ooh-oh-oh-oh

[Refrain: Chester Bennington]
Whoa-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
Whoa-oh, oh-ooh-oh-oh-oh

[Verse 3: Chester Bennington]
Weep not for roads untraveled
Weep not for sights unseen
May your love never end, and if you need a friend
There's a seat here alongside me

[Refrain: Chester Bennington]
Whoa, whoa-oh-oh-oh
Whoa-oh, whoa-oh-oh-oh
Whoa-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
Whoa-oh, oh-ooh-oh-oh-oh
Whoa-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
Whoa-oh, oh-ooh-oh-oh-oh
