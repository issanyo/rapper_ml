[Intro: Mike Shinoda]
This is not the end, this is not the beginning
This is not the end, this is not the beginning
This is not the end, this is not the beginning
Listen to the tone and the violent rhythm

This is not the end, this is not the beginning
This is not the end, this is not the beginning
This is not the end, this is not the beginning
Listen to the tone and the violent rhythm

[Verse 1: Chester Bennington]
Waiting for the end to come
Wishing I had strength to stand
This is not what I had planned
It's out of my control

Flying at the speed of light
Thoughts were spinning in my head
So many things were left unsaid
It's hard to let you go

[Chorus: Mike]
This is not the end, this is not the beginning
This is not the end, this is not the beginning
This is not the end, this is not the beginning
Listen to the tone and the violent rhythm

This is not the end, this is not the beginning
This is not the end, this is not the beginning
This is not the end, this is not the beginning
Listen to the tone and the violent rhythm

[Verse 2: Chester]
Waiting in an empty room
Trying to forget the past
This was never meant to last
I wish it wasn't so

I know what it takes to move on
I know how it feels to lie
All I want to do is trade this life for something new
Holding on to what I haven't got

[Chorus: Mike]
This is not the end, this is not the beginning
This is not the end, this is not the beginning
This is not the end, this is not the beginning
Listen to the tone and the violent rhythm

This is not the end, this is not the beginning
This is not the end, this is not the beginning
This is not the end, this is not the beginning
Listen to the tone and the violent rhythm

The hardest part of ending is starting again

[Bridge: Mike]
This is not the end, this is not the beginning
This is not the end, this is not the beginning
This is not the end, this is not the beginning
Listen to the tone and the violent rhythm

This is not the end, this is not the beginning
This is not the end, this is not the beginning
This is not the end, this is not the beginning
Listen to the tone and the violent rhythm

[Chorus: Mike]
This is not the end, this is not the beginning
This is not the end, this is not the beginning
This is not the end, this is not the beginning
Listen to the tone and the violent rhythm

This is not the end, this is not the beginning
This is not the end, this is not the beginning
This is not the end, this is not the beginning
Listen to the tone and the violent rhythm

[Outro: Mike]
Listen to the tone and the violent rhythm
Listen to the tone and the violent rhythm
