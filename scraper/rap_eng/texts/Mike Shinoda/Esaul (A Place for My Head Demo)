[Verse 1: Mike Shinoda]
Riding with a head full of buckets of red
And when they said still stuck in the head
A thoroughbred thoroughly bled
And led to the land of the mental combats
Following a front attack so you can never run from that

The planet sizing up the horizon
Smaller than a fly stand, I'm a lyrical lamp
The power that I got on my cynical hand
With a pen, once again

Swimming in the center of the hit or the miss
Reeling in my thoughts getting lost in the mist
Realizing one not the size of the fist
And the killing of the killer with a flick of the wrist

[Chorus: Chester Bennington & Mike Shinoda]
I wanna live in another place
Where no one can say that I lived for them
(Still see it's not meant to be for me)
I wanna be in the energy, not with the enemy
A place for my head

[Verse 2: Mike Shinoda]
The second it's gone
The weapon of time is stronger than a nuclear bomb
Eternity-you have not- So in that, you can't fight nor flee
Still, you'd be around if it wasn't for me

Way back first whatever my friends
That you see the attraction of the payback
Don't want me to say that, playback the thing now
Getting lost in the chaos tossing it down

Singing again to myself, electric neck twitch
Hungry for a head full of hectic
Accept this, doing double-duty on time
Adding to the panic in my confine

Singing again to myself, electric neck twitch
Hungry for a head full of hectic
Accept this, doing double-duty on time
Adding to the panic in my confine

[Chorus: Chester Bennington & Mike Shinoda]
I wanna live in another place
Where no one can say that I lived for them
(Still see it's not meant to be for me)
I wanna be in the energy, not with the enemy
A place for my head

[Bridge: Chester Bennington & Mike Shinoda]
Soon, the Aztec moon will heat my room, heal my wounds
Soon, the Aztec moon will heat my room, heal my wounds
Soon, the Aztec moon will heat my room, heal my wounds
Soon, the Aztec moon will heat my room, heal my wounds

Soon, the Aztec moon will heat my room, heal my wounds
Soon, the Aztec moon will heat my room, heal my wounds
Soon, the Aztec moon will heat my room, heal my wounds
Soon, the Aztec moon will heat my room, heal my wounds

[Chorus: Chester Bennington & Mike Shinoda]
I wanna live in another place
Where no one can say that I lived for them
(Still see it's not meant to be for me)
I wanna be in the energy, not with the enemy
A place for my head

[Outro: Mike Shinoda & Chester Bennington]
Burn! Burn! Burn!

Singing again to myself, electric neck twitch
Hungry for a head full of hectic
Accept this, doing double-duty on time
Adding to the panic in my confine

Singing again to myself, electric neck twitch
Hungry for a head full of hectic
Accept this, doing double-duty on time
An addict to the panic of my confine
