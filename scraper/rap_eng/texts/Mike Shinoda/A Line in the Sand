[Intro: Mike Shinoda]
Today, we stood on the wall
We laughed at the sun, we laughed at the guns, we laughed at it all
And when they, they told us to go
We paid them no mind like every other time, but little did we know

[Verse 1: Mike Shinoda & Chester Bennington]
Today, I looked for a sign
With flames in my hands, a line in the sand between yours and mine
And it came like fire from below
Your greed led the call, my flag had to fall, but little did you know

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
Another day, your truth will come
You're gonna pay for what you've, pay for what you've done
You'll get what's yours and face your crime
You'll tell them: "Give me back what's mine"
"Give me back what's mine"

[Verse 2: Mike Shinoda]
I'd never been a coward, I'd never seen blood
You'd sold me an ocean, and I was lost in the flood
We were counting on a leader, we were driven by need
But couldn't take temptation, and we were blinded by greed
You were steady as a sniper, we were waiting on a wire
So we never saw it coming when you ran from the fire
You can try intimidation, and you can try to ignore
But when the time comes calling, yeah, you are gonna get yours

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
Another day, your truth will come
You're gonna pay for what you've, pay for what you've done
You'll get what's yours and face your crime
You'll tell them: "Give me back what's mine"
"Give me back what's mine"

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
And so today, your truth has come
You're gonna pay for what you've, pay for what you've done
You'll get what's yours, you're out of time
And you will give me back what's mine
Give me back what's mine

[Post-Chorus: Chester Bennington]
Give me, give me back what's mine!
Give me, give me back what's mine!
What's mine!
Give me, give me back what's mine!
What's mine! What's mine!
Give me back what's mine!

[Outro: Mike Shinoda]
Today, we stood on the wall
We laughed at the sun, we laughed at the guns, we laughed at it all
And when they, they told us to go
We paid them no mind like every other time, but little did we know
