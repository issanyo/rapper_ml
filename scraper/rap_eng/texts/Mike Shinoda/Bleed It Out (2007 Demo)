[Verse 1]
How did this all come back around?
Left for dead when I hit the ground
After everything, now I've found
That you set me up just to knock me down

Here and now is where this begins
I don't know what your sickness is
But I do know what the difference is
Just show that face for your witnesses

Just talk and talk and talk and lie
With every little word, you rot inside
You're not really gonna stop and try
To make right of the wrong you caught me by

So, I know what's happening
I see that web you trapping in
You can kid yourself now, all you want
I'm not falling for that, again

[Verse 2]
Forget about all that who and when
The hurt you knew that drew me in
The dirt you rubbed my bruises in
The guilt that I felt when the rules were bent

This is where the brand new begins
This is where the confusion ends
I don't care if I lose or win
I just know that I don't want to pretend

Just talk and talk and laugh and grin
Here we go, just like that again
Back to get stabbed in the back again
Like the last time was just practicing

This time, here's what's happening
I see that web you trapping in
You can kid yourself now, all you want
I'm not falling for that, again

[Outro]
This time, here's what's happening
I see that web you trapping in
Kid yourself now, all you want
I'm not falling for that, again

This time, here's what's happening
I see that web you trapping in
Kid yourself now, all you want
I'm not falling for that, again
