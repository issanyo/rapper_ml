Intro – Alex Ahh ahh ahhh
Ahh ahh ahhh
Ahh ahhhh ahh ahhhh
Ahh ahh ahhh


Verse – Double X (Flexx)
Should've stayed, were there signs, I ignored? Can I help you, not to hurt, anymore?
We saw brilliance, when the world, was asleep There are things that we can have, but can't keep If they say…

Chorus - Alex
Who cares if one more light goes out? In the sky of a million stars
It flickers, flickers

Who cares when someone's time runs out? If a moment is all we are
Or quicker, quicker

Who cares if one more light goes out? Well I do

Verse – Double X (Flexx)
The reminders pull the floor from your feet
In the kitchen, one more chair than you need ohh
And you're angry, and you should be, it's not fair
Just cause you can't see it, doesn't mean it, isn't there
If they say…

Chorus - Alex
Who cares if one more light goes out? In the sky of a million stars
It flickers, flickers

Who cares when someone's time runs out? If a moment is all we are
Or quicker, quicker

Who cares if one more light goes out? Well I do

Guitar SOLO – Robert “Dubwise” Browne

Chorus - Alex
Who cares if one more light goes out? In the sky of a million stars
It flickers, flickers

Who cares when someone's time runs out?
If a moment is all we are or quicker, quicker
Who cares if one more light goes out? Well I do
