[Intro]
That beat is hard

[Verse 1: Mike Shinoda]
This is how it goes, welcome one and all to the show
We're wired up, fired up, fucking ready to go
In the back of the parking lot, outside of the bar
Twenty deep, twenty feet from the boulevard

Black hoodies, black caps, black label in glasses
Previewing the new shit before the masses
'Cause the first thing I need when I've got a new beat
Is to see how it sounds, echoing off the street

I just take it for a spin, pop the CD in
Slide it up to ten and get that rear view shaking
Then play it again so there's no mistaking
San Andreas the block, get this bitch earthquaking, like oh

[Chorus: Mike Shinoda]
Oh, ready for it, here we go
We got the whole block rocking in stereo
We're taking control, letting everybody know
And if you feel it, let me hear everybody go oh

[Verse 2: Mike Shinoda]
You're not ready
I got plenty cuts for twenty months dropped steadily
Plenty tracks to empty on your wack pedigree
I'm backed heavily, while you're back-pedalling

Forget the chitchat on me, homie kick back
I'm on that shit that can get your homie bitch-slapped
So zip your lip back, listen and watch
We got the whole block rocking off the way the beat knocks

You don't have to warn the people on the corner they know
That if you're standing on that corner then you're getting that show
World premiering, you're hearing that Machine Shop flow
San Andreas the block, get this bitch earthquaking, like oh

[Chorus: Mike Shinoda]
Oh, ready for it, here we go
We got the whole block rocking in stereo
We're taking control, letting everybody know
And if you feel it, let me hear everybody go

[Bridge: Mike Shinoda]
Turn the key, turn the volume up to loud
Roll right, roll every window down
Let the whole block know what this is about
Turn it up y'all, burn that system out

Turn the key, turn the volume up to loud
Roll right, roll every window down
Let the whole block know what this is about
Turn it up y'all, burn that system like

[Chorus: Mike Shinoda]
Oh, ready for it, here we go
We got the whole block rocking in stereo
We're taking control, letting everybody know
And if you feel it, let me hear everybody go oh

[Outro: Mike Shinoda]
Let's go out and test out the speakers
You Ready? Let's go! Like This!
