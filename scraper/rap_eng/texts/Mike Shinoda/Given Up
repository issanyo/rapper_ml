[Verse 1: Chester Bennington]
Waking in sweat again
Another day's been laid to waste, in my disgrace
Stuck in my head again
Feels like I'll never leave this place, there's no escape
I'm my own worst enemy...

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
I've given up, I'm sick of feeling
Is there nothing you can say?
Take this all away, I'm suffocating
Tell me what the fuck is wrong with me

[Verse 2: Chester Bennington]
I don't know what to take
Thought I was focused but I'm scared, I'm not prepared
I hyperventilate
Looking for help somehow, somewhere and no one cares
I'm my own worst enemy

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
I've given up, I'm sick of feeling
Is there nothing you can say?
Take this all away, I'm suffocating
Tell me what the fuck is wrong with me

[Bridge: Chester Bennington]
Put me out of my misery!
Put me out of my misery!
Put me out of my
Put me out of my fucking misery!

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
I've given up, I'm sick of feeling
Is there nothing you can say?
Take this all away, I'm suffocating
Tell me what the fuck is wrong with me
