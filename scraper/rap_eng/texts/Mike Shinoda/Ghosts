[Verse 1]
She said
This is not about a poltergeist
Not about a phantom that glows at night
But there are things we don’t know and I
Don’t have another choice but an open mind, oh
And I know what they’ll say
I’m trying to make sense of what no one can explain
But I’ve been having dreams that after I’m awake
Play out in reality the very next day

[Pre-Chorus]
So I play along
I nod my head when they say I’m wrong
But each night falls and away I run
On the other side 'til the daylight comes
So I play along
I nod my head when they say I’m wrong
But each night falls and away I run
On the other side 'til the daylight comes

[Chorus 1]
And when the lights go down
I see things I can’t explain
Calling out my name
The lights go down
Holding every memory close
Tonight is for our ghosts
Ghosts, ghosts
Tonight is for our ghosts

[Verse 2]
This is not about you and me
I can’t bring back how it used to be
And I know what I do believe, but
I’ve already seen what I couldn’t see, oh

[Pre-Chorus]
So I play along
I nod my head when they say I’m wrong
But each night falls and away I run
On the other side 'til the daylight comes

[Chorus 1]
And when the lights go down
I see things I can’t explain
Calling out my name
The lights go down
Holding every memory close
Tonight is for our ghosts

[Chorus 2]
And when the lights go down
Is there something in the air?
There but never there
The lights go down
Holding every memory close
Tonight is for our ghosts
Ghosts, ghosts
Tonight is for our ghosts
Ghosts, ghosts
Tonight is for our ghosts
