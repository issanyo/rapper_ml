My heart is in my stomach and my feet are off the ground
And I swear I don't think I can shake it
Holding all my breath cause I know what happens next
And I just don't think I can take it
I say I’m doing good, so they think I’m doing fine
But the truth is that I lie
So for now, please let me hold it in

Every little light burns out
Every little star can fade to black
Even when you shine so bright that there’s nothing left
Everything will be okay
Even the sun has rainy days
You just gotta fight through the night to see what lies ahead
You just gotta fight through the night to see what lies ahead

Piercing through the silence, when everything is quiet
My thoughts are too damn loud
Hiding under covers hope no one discovers
This weight keeps on bringing me down
Plaster on a smile for a little while I just wanna feel something again
But for now please let me hold it in

Every little light burns out
Every little star can fade to black
Even when you shine so bright that there’s nothing left
Everything will be okay
Even the sun has rainy days
You just gotta fight through the night to see what lies ahead

I know it's hard to swallow
I know it's hard to face the truth
I know it's hard ohhhhh
When you feel like hope is fading, and there's nothing left to lose

Every little light burns out
Every little star can fade to black
Even when you shine so bright that there’s nothing left
Everything will be okay
Even the sun has rainy days
You just gotta fight through the night to see what lies ahead
Every little light burns out
Every little star can fade to black
Even when you shine so bright that there’s nothing left
Everything will be okay
Even the sun has rainy days
You just gotta fight through the night to see what lies ahead
You just gotta fight through the night to see what lies ahead
You just gotta fight through the night to see what lies ahead
