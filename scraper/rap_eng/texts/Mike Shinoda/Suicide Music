[Chorus: Apathy & Ryu]
You could take our lives
Fill us up with lies
'Cause I know where I'm going when I die
And I don't even cry, middle finger to the sky
'Cause I know where I'm going when I die
Yeah, cause even if I got to live a life of crime
You got it, I'ma get it
Never need a nine-to-five
I'll push it to the limit 'til it's time to say goodbye, that's fine
'Cause I know just where I'm going when I die

[Verse 1: Apathy]
See me in the microscope, see me in the fish tank
Chicks want to know my real name plus the dick length
Me? I'm a scientist
God to a lab rat
Now I'm just a has-been rapper in the hazmat
Ducking straight shots, sewing up wounds
Filling up tombs
Let the bass boom
Blood everywhere, so chaotic
I'm a bullet with your name on it
Seeking body after body, and the Mayor, Giuliani
Ain't in office anymore but he's still Illuminati
Death to the king, overthrow everything
They'll be searching our apartments in an ATF sting
Get Busy, the scum of the earth
Hold a black magic s√©ance to summon my verse
I'm a walking skeleton, the zombie that will rush the crowd
Devil baby, I was born inside a mushroom cloud

[Chorus: Apathy & Ryu]
You could take our lives
Fill us up with lies
'Cause I know where I'm going when I die
And I don't even cry, middle finger to the sky
'Cause I know where I'm going when I die
Yeah, cause even if I got to live a life of crime
You got it, I'ma get it
Never need a nine-to-five
I'll push it to the limit 'til it's time to say goodbye, that's fine
'Cause I know just where I'm going when I die

[Verse 2: Ryu]
Suicide Music
Nothing to fucking fool with
Full clip and an Uzi, shooting out of Suzukis
No excuse, we blast now
Splatter your goose down
Clapping like it's the end, I ruin your fucking movie
Asking for passes
Homie, I'm not a cuby here to bang
Blow your brains all over your bitch's boobies
Take me alive? Never, better to die free
I'm writing "fuck the police" inside a goodbye letter
Peace, fade to black, call the priest
Tell him to call Heaven and save me a few seats
Sorry it's so last minute, I'm bringing a few peeps
Body the lieutenant and took a shot at the chief
Sheesh, I guess I got a little problem with authority
Tend to get a little bit gruesome and gory
Volume on ten if I got to get it in
Always keep a pistol grip pump sitting on my lap like a yorkie

[Chorus: Apathy & Ryu]
You could take our lives
Fill us up with lies
'Cause I know where I'm going when I die
And I don't even cry, middle finger to the sky
'Cause I know where I'm going when I die
Yeah, cause even if I got to live a life of crime
You got it, I'ma get it
Never need a nine-to-five
I'll push it to the limit 'til it's time to say goodbye, that's fine
'Cause I know just where I'm going when I die

Kill yourself, call me if you need some help
Kill yourself, call me if you need some help

Kill yourself, call me if you need some help
Kill yourself, call me if you need some help
Kill yourself, call me if you need some help
Kill yourself, call me if you need some help
