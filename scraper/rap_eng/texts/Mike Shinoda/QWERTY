[Intro: Chester Bennington]
Your lies!

[Verse 1: Mike Shinoda]
Yeah!
I didn't think that I had a debt to pay
'Til they came to take all I had left away
You said you wouldn't put me to the test today
But I remember you saying that yesterday
There was a time when your mind wasn't out of control
Every memory and confession pouring out of your soul
Like a pill you couldn't swallow and it swallowed you whole
Another lie hard to follow 'til it followed you home
And like that

[Pre-Chorus: Chester Bennington]
Broken down
A victim of your lies

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
You hide behind lies
You don't know why
You crossed the line
Wrapped up inside your lies
You hide behind lies
You're lost inside that cold disguise
Behind your lies

[Verse 2: Mike Shinoda]
I don't know what you thought I might say
Seems like we never would talk the right way
Every other minute I fought for my place
And drop what I made thought and you might stay so
I'm guessing that you probably know
When your inside's hollow then you ought to be cold
Like a pill I couldn't swallow and it swallowed me whole
Another lie hard to follow 'til it followed me home
And like that

[Pre-Chorus: Chester]
Broken down
A victim of your lies

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
You hide behind lies
You don't know why
You crossed the line
Wrapped up inside your lies
You hide behind lies
You're lost inside that cold disguise
Behind your lies

[Bridge: Chester Bennington]
You're faking, you're mistaken
If you think that you could climb out of this hole
Forsaken, what we take when
All our lies come from the power of control

[Pre-Chorus: Chester]
Broken down
A victim of your lies

[Interlude: Chester & Mike]
You hide behind lies
You don't know why
You hide behind lies
You don't know why
You hide behind lies
You don't know why
You hide behind
Wrapped up inside your lies

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
You hide behind lies
You don't know why
You crossed the line
Wrapped up inside your lies
You hide behind lies
You're lost inside that cold disguise
Behind your lies
