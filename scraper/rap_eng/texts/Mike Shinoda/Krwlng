[Intro (w/ echoes and distortions)]
Crawling in my skin

(Crawling in my skin)
Without a sense of confidence
Consuming, confusing
(Crawling in my skin)
Without a sense of confidence
I’m convinced that there’s just too much pressure to take
There’s something inside me
That pulls beneath the surface

[Chorus: Aaron Lewis & Mike Shinoda]
Crawling in my skin
(Crawling in my skin)
These wounds, they will not heal
(These wounds, they will not heal)
Fear is how I fall
(Fear is how I fall)
Confusing, confusing what is real
Confusing what is real

[Verse 1: Chester & Mike]
There’s something inside me
That pulls beneath the surface
Consuming, confusing
This lack of self-control
I fear is never ending
Controlling, I can’t seem
To find myself again
My walls are closing in
(Without a sense of confidence
I’m convinced that there’s just too much pressure to take)
I’ve felt this way before
So insecure

[Chorus: Chester & Aaron]
Crawling in my skin
These wounds, they will not heal
Fear is how I fall
Confusing what is real

[Verse 2: Chester & Mike]
Discomfort endlessly has pulled itself upon me
Distracting, reacting
Against my will, I stand beside my own reflection
It’s haunting
How I can’t seem
To find myself again
My walls are closing in
(Without a sense of confidence
I’m convinced that there’s just too much pressure to take)
I’ve felt this way before
So insecure

[Bridge: Mike & Chester]
Without a sense of confidence, without a sense of confidence, without a sense of confidence
I’m convinced that there’s just too much pressure to take
(x2)
To find myself again
My walls are closing in
Without a sense of confidence
I’m convinced that there’s just too much pressure to take
I’ve felt this way before
So insecure

[Chorus (x2)]
Crawling in my skin
Crawling in my skin
These wounds, they will not heal
These wounds, they will not heal
Fear is how I fall
Fear is how I fall
Confusing, confusing what is real
Confusing what is real
