[Verse 1: Mike Shinoda]
I've seen the blood, I've seen the broken
The lost and the sights unseen
I want a flood, I want an ocean
To wash my confusion clean
I can't resolve this empty story
I can't repair the damage done

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
We are the fortunate ones
Who've never faced oppression's gun
We are the fortunate ones
Imitations of rebellion

[Verse 2: Mike Shinoda]
We acted out, we wear the colors
Confined by the things we own
We're not without, we're like each other
Pretending we're here alone
And far away they burn their buildings
Right in the face of the damage done

[Chorus: Chester Bennington & Mike Shinoda]
We are the fortunate ones
Who've never faced oppression's gun
We are the fortunate ones
Imitations of rebellion
Rebellion
Rebellion
Rebellion

[Bridge: Chester Bennington]
Rebellion, rebellion!
We lost before the start!
Rebellion, rebellion!
One by one, we fall apart!
We fall apart!
We fall apart!
We fall apart!

[Chorus: Chester Bennington & Mike Shinoda]
We are the fortunate ones
Who've never faced oppression's gun
We are the fortunate ones
Imitations of, imitations of...
We are the fortunate ones
Who've never faced oppression's gun
We are the fortunate ones
Imitations of rebellion
Rebellion
Rebellion
Rebellion
