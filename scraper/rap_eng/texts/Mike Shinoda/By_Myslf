[Intro: Chester Bennington]
Myself! Myself!

[Verse 1: Mike Shinoda]
What do I do to ignore them behind me?
Do I follow my instincts blindly?
Do I hide my pride from these bad dreams
And give in to sad thoughts that are maddening?

Do I sit here and try to stand it?
Or do I try to catch them red-handed?
Do I trust some and get fooled by phoniness?
Or do I trust nobody and live in loneliness?

Because I can't hold on when I'm stretched so thin
I make the right moves, but I'm lost within
I put on my daily facade, but then
I just end up getting hurt again

[Pre-Chorus: Mike & Chester]
By myself (Myself!) I ask why
(But in my mind, I find) I can't rely on myself
(Myself!) I ask why
(But in my mind, I find) I can't rely on myself

[Chorus: Chester]
I can't look around (It's too much to take in)
I can't hold on (When I'm stretched so thin)
I can't slow down (Watching everything spin)
I can't look back (It's starting over again)

[Verse 2: Mike]
If I turn my back, I'm defenseless
And to go blindly seems senseless
If I hide my pride and let it all go on
Then they'll take from me 'til everything is gone

If I let them go, I'll be outdone
But if I try to catch them, I'll be outrun
If I'm killed by the questions like a cancer
Then I'll be buried in the silence of the answer

[Pre-Chorus: Mike & Chester]
By myself (Myself!) I ask why
(But in my mind, I find) I can't rely on myself
(Myself!) I ask why
(But in my mind, I find) I can't rely on myself

[Chorus: Chester]
I can't look around (It's too much to take in)
I can't hold on (When I'm stretched so thin)
I can't slow down (Watching everything spin)
I can't look back (It's starting over again)

[Interlude: Mike]
Don't you, don't you, don't you, don't you
Don't you, don't you, don't you, don't you
Don't you, don't you, don't you, don't you
Don't you, don't you, don't you, don't you
Don't you, don't you, don't you, don't you
Don't you, don't you, don't you, don't you
Don't you, don't you, don't you, don't you

[Outro: Chester & Mike]
Know! (I can't tell you how to make it)
Go! (No matter what I do, how hard I)
Try! (I can't seem to convince myself)
Why! (I'm stuck on the outside, don't you)

Know! (I can't tell you how to make it)
Go! (No matter what I do, how hard I)
Try! (I can't seem to convince myself)
Why! (I'm stuck on the outside, don't you)

Know! (I can't tell you how to make it)
Go! (No matter what I do, how hard I)
Try! (I can't seem to convince myself)
Why! (I'm stuck on the outside, don't you)

Know! (I can't tell you how to make it)
Go! (No matter what I do, how hard I)
Try! (I can't seem to convince myself)
Why! (I'm stuck on the outside, don't you)

Know! (I can't tell you how to make it)
Go! (No matter what I do, how hard I)
Try! (I can't seem to convince myself)
Why! (I'm stuck on the outside)
