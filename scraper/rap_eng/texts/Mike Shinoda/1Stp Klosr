[Intro]
(I'm about to break)
I need a little room to breathe
'Cause I'm one step closer to the edge
And I'm about to break

I'm about to break
This room to breathe
This room to breathe
This room to breathe

[Verse 1: Chester Bennington]
I cannot take this, anymore
Saying everything I've said before

All these words, they make no sense
I found bliss in ignorance
Less I hear, the less you say
You'll find that out, anyway

[Verse 2: Chester]
I find the answers aren't so clear
Wish I could find a way to disappear

All these thoughts, they make no sense
I found bliss in ignorance
Nothing seems to go away
Over and over again

Over and over again
Over and over again
Over and over again
Over and over again

Just like before, like before
Like before, like before, like before

[Pre-Chorus: Chester]
Everything you say to me
And I'm about to break
I need a little room to breathe
And I'm about to break

Everything you say to me
And I'm about to break
I need a little room to breathe
And I'm about to (Break)

[Verse 3: Jonathan Davis]
These are the places where I can feel
Torn from my body, my flesh, it peels
During this ride, we can cut up what we like
(I'm about to break)

Waiting alone, I cannot resist
Feeling this hate I have never missed
Please, someone give me a reason
To rip off my face

Blood is a-pouring and pouring and pouring
And pouring and pouring and pouring and pouring
And pouring and pouring and pouring...

[Bridge: Chester & Jonathan]
Shut up when I'm talking to you!
Shut up! (Blood is pouring)
Shut up! (Blood is pouring)
Shut up! (Blood is pouring)

Shut up when I'm talking to you!
Shut up! (Blood is pouring)
Shut up! (Blood is pouring)
Shut up! (Blood is pouring)

Shut up
I'm about to break!

[Chorus: Chester & (Mike Shinoda)]
Everything you say to me, I'm about to break!
I need a little room to breathe, I'm about to break!
Everything you say to me, and I'm about to break!
I need a little room to breathe, and I'm about to...

Everything you say to me
(Takes me one step closer to the edge) And I'm about to break!
I need a little room to breathe
('Cause I'm one step closer to the edge) I'm about to break!

Everything you say to me
(Takes me one step closer to the edge) And I'm about to break!
I need a little room to breathe
('Cause I'm one step closer to the edge) And I'm about to...
