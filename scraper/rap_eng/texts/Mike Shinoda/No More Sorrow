[Verse 1]
Are you lost in your lies?
Do you tell yourself I don't realize
Your crusade's a disguise?
Replaced freedom with fear, you trade money for lives

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm aware of what you've done

[Chorus]
No, no more sorrow
I've paid for your mistakes
Your time is borrowed
Your time has come to be replaced

[Verse 2]
I see pain, I see need
I see liars and thieves abuse power with greed
I had hope, I believed
But I'm beginning to think that I've been deceived

[Pre-Chorus]
You will pay for what you've done

[Chorus]
No, no more sorrow
I've paid for your mistakes
Your time is borrowed
Your time has come to be replaced

[Bridge]
Thieves and hypocrites
Thieves and hypocrites
Thieves and hypocrites

[Chorus]
No, no more sorrow
I've paid for your mistakes
Your time is borrowed
Your time has come to be replaced

No, no more sorrow
I've paid for your mistakes
Your time is borrowed
Your time has come to be replaced

[Outro]
Your time has come to be replaced
Your time has come to be erased
