[Verse 1]
Down on the floor
Back behind the door
I try to catch my breath again
I can't ignore
What's back behind the door
Wondering what's next again

[Pre-Chorus]
I can say that you're the one
That battles always choose
But sometimes I realize
That I'm the one confused

[Chorus]
I don't know what we're fighting for
Or why we have to scream
I don't know why I instigate
And say what I don't mean
I don't know how we got this way
I know it's not alright
So I'm breaking the habit
I'm breaking the habit, tonight

[Verse 2]
Memories consume, pacing in the room
Cleaning broken glass again
Suddenly soon you're leaving from the room
It's happening so fast again

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
Crashing into walls
It never was your fault
So here we are again
And this is how it ends

[Chorus/Outro]
I don't know what we're fighting for
Or why we have to scream
I don't know why I instigate
And say what I don't mean
I don't know how we got this way
I know it's not alright
So I'm breaking the habit
I'm breaking the habit
I'm breaking the habit, tonight
