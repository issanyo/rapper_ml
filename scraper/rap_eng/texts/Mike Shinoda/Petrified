[Chorus 1]
Y'all are not, not ready (No), not ready (No)
Pick up drop it steady so
Do it like that, like that, like that
Like that, like that, like that, like that

[Chorus 2]
Now why is everybody so petrified (What)
Petrified (What), step aside and just
Drop that (Come on), drop that (Come on)
Drop that (Come on), drop that (Come on)
Now why is everybody so petrified (What)
Petrified (What), step aside and just
Drop that (Come on), drop that (Come on)
Drop that (Come on), drop that (Come on)

[Verse 1: Mike Shinoda]
Yeah, how you doin' y'all, my name's Mike
I'm foolin' with the new shit I'm doin' it all night
I like what I do, I do what I like
I could quit and get it back like I'm ridin' a bike
Like stop, bring it back bring it back
We got that balance keeping us on track
That you get when you movin' quick with no slow
You stare like you don't care but you do though
I know, you really must be so lonely
Puffed up like you tough, but so phony
You and your boys you don't know me
You really wanna hold me, show me homie
Let's get it over with for good
I got a friction addiction I wish you would
Machine Shop rockin' when we step inside and we
Got everybody so petrified

[Chorus]
Now why is everybody so petrified (What)
Petrified (What), step aside and just
Drop that (Come on), drop that (Come on)
Drop that (Come on), drop that (Come on)

[Verse 2: Mike Shinoda]
Listen you are not ready
Like children in a building you can't stand steady
It must be the beat so heavy causing
Panic attacks like a crack in the levy
Give you that Robert Plant
"Dancing Days" are back feeling all in the track and in fact
For those knowin' the name, I'm back
With some brand new crack who can do it like that
You really must be so lonely
Puffed up like you tough, but so phony
You and your boys you don't know me
You really wanna hold me, show me homie
Tough talk doesn't mean a thing
Get over yourself you know when we're up in a scene
It's Machine Shop rockin' when we step inside
And we got everybody so petrified

[Chorus 2]
Now why is everybody so petrified (What)
Petrified (What), step aside and just
Drop that (Come on), drop that (Come on)
Drop that (Come on), drop that (Come on)
Now why is everybody so petrified (What)
Petrified (What), step aside and just
Drop that (Come on), drop that (Come on)
Drop that (Come on), drop that (Come on)

[Chorus 1]
Y'all are not, not ready (No), not ready (No)
Pick up drop it steady so
Do it like that, like that, like that
Like that, like that, like that, like that
Y'all are not, not ready (No), not ready (No)
Pick up drop it steady so
Do it like that, like that, like that
Like that, like that, like that, like that

Get up

[Chorus 2]
Now why is everybody so petrified (What)
Petrified (What), step aside and just
Drop that (Come on), drop that (Come on)
Drop that (Come on), drop that (Come on)
Now why is everybody so petrified (What)
Petrified (What), step aside and just
Drop that (Come on), drop that (Come on)
Drop that (Come on), drop that (Come on)

[Outro]
Like stop, bring it back bring it back
We got that balance keeping us on track
Like stop, bring it back bring it back
We got that balance keeping us on track
Like stop, bring it back bring it back
We got that balance keeping us on track
Like stop, bring it back bring it back
We got that balance keeping us on track
Like stop, stop, stop, stop
Stop, stop, stop, stop
Machine Shop, shop, shop, shop
