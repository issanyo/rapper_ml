[Intro]
"You know what I mean?
You could put a label on a life
Put a label on a lifestyle" (Sometimes)
"You know, put a label on how you wake up every morning
And go to bed at night" (Hybrid)

[Verse 1: Mike Shinoda]
I've been diggin' into crates, ever since I was living in space
Before the rat race, before monkeys had human traits
I mastered numerology and big bang theology
Performed lobotomies with telekinetic psychology

Invented the mic so I could start blessing it
Chin-checkin' kids to make my point like an impressionist
Many men have tried to shake us
But I twist mic cords to double-helixes
And show them what I'm made of

I buckle knees like leg braces
Cast a spell of instrumentalness on all of you MC's who hate us
So you can try on, leave you without a shoulder to cry on
From now to infinity, let icons be bygones

I firebomb, ghostly notes haunt this
I tried threats but moved on to a promise
I stomp shit with or without an accomplice
And run the gauntlet with whoever that wants this

[Chorus: Mike Shinoda]
High voltage, this is the unforgettable sound
High voltage, bringing you up and taking you down
High voltage, coming at you from every side
High voltage, making the rhythm and rhyme collide

[Verse 2: Mike Shinoda]
(Akira)
I put a kick in the backbones of clones with microphones
Never satisfy my rhyme jones
Spraying bright day over what you might say
My blood type's Krylon, Technicolor Type-A

On highways, bright with road rage
Pages of wind in cages of tin that bounce all around
(Surround sound) Devouring the scene
Subliminal gangrene paintings, overall the same thing

Sing-song karaoke copy bullshit
Break bones verbally with sticks-and-stone tactics
Fourth dimension combat convention
Write rhymes at ease while the track stands at attention

Meant to put you away with a pencil pistol official
Sixteen-line, the rhyme missile
While you risk your all, I pick out all your flaws
Spittin' rah blah blah blah, you can say you saw

[Chorus: Mike Shinoda]
High voltage, this is the unforgettable sound
High voltage, bringing you up and taking you down
High voltage, coming at you from every side
High voltage, making the rhythm and rhyme collide

High voltage, this is the unforgettable sound
High voltage, bringing you up and taking you down
High voltage, coming at you from every side
High voltage, making the rhythm and rhyme collide

[Interlude]
"And like the rock and rap, you know what I mean?
People acting like, you know
"Wow, that's a new invention"
That shit ain't new
We're constantly evolving
It is constantly changing" (Sometimes)
"There's a lot of change
Everybody's always trying to put labels on
There ain't no label for this shit
They always gonna try to put a label on it
Try to create something so they could water it down"

[Bridge: Chester Bennington]
Sometimes, I feel like a prophet
Misunderstood, under the gun like a new disease
Sometimes, I feel like a prophet
Misunderstood, under the gun like a new disease

[Chorus: Mike Shinoda]
High voltage, this is the unforgettable sound
High voltage, bringing you up and taking you down
High voltage, coming at you from every side
High voltage, making the rhythm and rhyme collide

High voltage, this is the unforgettable sound
High voltage, bringing you up and taking you down
High voltage, coming at you from every side
High voltage, making the rhythm and rhyme collide

High voltage, this is the unforgettable sound
High voltage, bringing you up and taking you down
High voltage, coming at you from every side
High voltage, making the rhythm and rhyme collide

High voltage, this is the unforgettable sound
High voltage, bringing you up and taking you down
High voltage, coming at you from every side
High voltage, making the rhythm and rhyme collide

[Outro]
"You know what I mean?
You can't put a label on a lifestyle"
