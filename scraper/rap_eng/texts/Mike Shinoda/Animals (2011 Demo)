[Verse 1: Mike Shinoda]
This is where the pain comes from
This is how the payback sounds
This is why the fire goes up
This is why the walls come down

You ain't never been in these shoes
Never know a word that I'm saying
So the only thing to keep the blood flowing
Is to let you know I'm not playing

I'ma see your lies exposed
I'ma see the justice done
I'ma see the sun come back
I'ma see the kingdom come

Take it where it can't come back
Take it where the shadows been
Take it to the breaking point
Take it to the end

[Verse 2: Mike Shinoda]
Saying that the end is near
God, you have no idea
Used to be afraid, but now
Only thing I fear is fear

This is where the line gets drawn
Something that you've always known
This is what you're hiding from
True fellows, never yours to own

Give me back the fire I had
Give me back the faith I lost
Give me back the trust you broke
Give me back the pride it cost

Take the venom out of my blood
Take the pain you put me in
Take it when I tell you so
Take it to the end
