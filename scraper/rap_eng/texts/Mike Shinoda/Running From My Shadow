[Verse 1: Mike Shinoda]
Wanna know where I don't go
When it goes from "okay" to a "oh no"
When it goes from hi five to a low blow
When it goes from all five to a solo
Lemme tell you what you don't know
I been down, so low, I was
Looking for something but denying that I found it
There's an elephant sitting in the room
And I can't find another way to tiptoe around it
I been doing greater good for a long time
But I can't find any other way to give now
I been putting myself on the sideline
And it's been time so I'm saying can I live now

There are times when I kick myself
Say I'm not sick but I can't get well
Say I got this while I chase my tail
As if they can't tell

[Chorus: Mike Shinoda]
I'm running from my shadow
Running from my shadow but it's still there chasing me down
I'll never win the battle
Never win the battle and I should have known it by now
Just when I think I've found the end (Oh)
I'm going back around again (Oh)
Running from my shadow
Running from my shadow but it's still there chasing me down

[Verse 2: Mike Shinoda]
Light side's got a dark side to it
Daytime flows into night like fluid
The yin and the yang with a curved line through it
And none of it's illuminating why I do it
Maybe I didn't want to chase what was not right
Maybe I didn't want to face you were offsides
Thinking I was far away from a crossed line
But I was giving soft praise to a hard lie
There are things that you say and you don't say
My tongue's gotten real tired of me biting it
'Cause I keep on following the wrong way
Time's come and I can't keep denying it
There are times when I kick myself
Say I'm not sick but I can't get well
Say I got this while I chase my tail
As if they can't tell

[Chrous: Mike Shinoda]
I'm running from my shadow
Running from my shadow but it's still there chasing me down
I'll never win the battle
Never win the battle and I should have known it by now
Just when I think I've found the end (Oh)
I'm going back around again (Oh)
Running from my shadow
Running from my shadow but it's still there chasing me down

[Outro: grandson]
I love you but I know, I gotta let you go
Dancing with the devil cause she's all I've ever known
Wanted to pretend, that this time was the end
Sorry but I guess I gotta let you down again
Again
Again
Running from my shadow now my shadow is my only friend

Running from my shadow
But it's still there chasing me down
Running from my shadow
Running from my shadow but it's still there chasing me down
