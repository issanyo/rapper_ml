[Verse 1: Mike Shinoda]
Someone, right now, is leaving their apartment
Looking down at the street and wondering where their car went
Someone in the car, sitting at a signal
In front of a restaurant, staring through the window
At someone, right now, with their finger in their teeth
Who could use a little floss, right across the street
There's somebody on the curb who really needs a jacket
Spent half the rent, at a bar getting plastered
Now, he's gotta walk fourteen blocks
Just to work at a shop where he's about to get fired
Someone, right now, is looking pretty tired
Staring at a laptop, trying to get inspired
Somebody living right across the street
Just wrote the best thing that she's written all week
But her best friend's coughing up blood in the sink
He can't even think what happened, feeling so confused
That he knows it looks bad, but there's nothing he could do
I wonder what's it like being right there in his shoes, but...

[Chorus: Mike Shinoda]
Yo, I'm just taking it in
Out the window of a hotel bedroom, again
Tomorrow, I'll be gone, I don't know when I'll be back
But in this world, everything can change just like that

[Verse 2: Ryu]
Yo, somebody, right now, is dropping his vote
Inside a box and trying not to get shot in his throat
For the act of freedom, right now, somebody stuck in Iraq
Hoping that he gets shipped back breathing
In a war where he's not really sure of the reasons
So, we show our support when the press mislead him
Though we mourn, remain proud and salute the troops
Get some, I know you boys got some work to do

[Tak]
Meanwhile, right now someone's twenty-five to life
And standing on the corner with their thumb up, hitch hike
And scratching of a lotto ticket, hoping for a real winner
Sneaking through the border just to work and eat a real dinner
Right now, someone wishes they were you and I
Instead of second guessing fatal thoughts of quiet suicide
But right now, staring out the window at a fiend
With holes in his arms and holes in his jeans
He pulled out a cigarette and sparked a light
And walked right around the corner, just out of my sight, but..

[Chorus: Ryu & Tak]
Yo, I'm just taking it in
From a second story hotel window, again
The TV's on and my bags are packed
But in this world, everything can change just like that
Yo, I'm just taking it in
From a second story hotel window, again
The TV's on and my bags are packed
But in this world, everything can change just like that

[Verse 3: Black Thought]
Right now, somebody's sitting in the darkness
Trying to figure how to put some heat in their apartment
But they got a little mattress, a little carpet
And they appreciate it 'cause some people on a park bench
You see them when you rushing to get to the office
Wife fly by when she coming home from the market
Right now, somebody's coming out the pocket
Trying to dump that rock, they run around the block with
Same time, the cops is raising their Glock's
With aim to fill your legs and your back with some hot shit
Right now, somebody's struggling to stop this man
Who's kicking and punching and cussing at the doctors
Down the hall, the child taking his first breath
The doctors ain't even passed him to the nurse yet
Yo, I wonder if he understand what it's worth yet
Like time spent, while we're on the earth, yeah
The answer to the question we all seek
Can be found, it depends on how free ya'll think
Right now, it's somebody who ain't eat all week
That would kill for the shit you throw away in the street
I guess one man's trash is the next man's treasure
One man's pain is the next man's pleasure
One say infinity, the next say forever
Right now, everybody gotta get it together, man

[Chorus: Black Thought]
Uh, I'm just taking it in
In an another strange hotel lobby, again
Put my luggage on my back, I don't know where I'm at
I'm in a world where it all changes, just like that

[Mike Shinoda]
Yeah, I'm just taking it in
Out the window of a hotel bedroom, again
Tomorrow, I'll be gone, I don't know when I'll be back
But in this world, everything can change just like that
