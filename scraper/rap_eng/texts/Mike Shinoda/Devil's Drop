[Verse]
Landing in the Devil's drop
I walked out in the snow
And climbed up to the mountain top
A push from death below

Brother fell protecting us
Somewhere far from home
Lay him down to rest with us
In fields of earth and coal

Oh, whoa
Oh, whoa

[Bridge]
Sailing out away from this
To ports of foreign shores
Let us not forget to miss
The ones we cannot hold

Oh, whoa
Oh, whoa

[Verse]
Landing in the Devil's drop
I walked out in the snow
And climbed up to the mountain top
A push from death below

Brother fell protecting us
Somewhere far from home
Lay him down to rest with us
In fields of earth and coal
