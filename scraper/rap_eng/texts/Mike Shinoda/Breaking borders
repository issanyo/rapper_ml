[intro]

The golden sipp take one yeah
Lets do this shit man
Shout out Mike yeah

[Verse 1]
1996 from the 656, i was chillin' off the flix
Talkin' 'bout it with my sis
Cop the beamer hit the keys
Er PM high clip reloaded
Wrist so lonely put some ice on it
I write it delete it i want you i mean it
Beybleedin' spin it ya'll niggas schemin'
Yall niggas daydreamin' yall niggas schemin'
Yall niggas daydreamin' damn i just did it
Callin' my niggas for feedback, callin' the plug for the big stash
Going straight for the big racks

[Chorus]
Bitch come and find me breaking borders (breaking borders)
(breaking borders)
(breaking borders)

[Verse 2]
International, reppin' 2 sides working on my stripes
I'm like Mario jumpin' over pipes
I am not the saving hoes type
I'm a peaceful guy, but test me up i just might
Get the strap J town, talk
Bitch, i waste no bullets
One straight to the head
One shot one kill no scope one clip
Hit the pop got a click
Palm the palm with the clique
Straightjacket I'm a freak
Where the choppa got a streak

[Chorus]
Bitch come and find me breaking borders (breaking borders)
(breaking borders)
(breaking borders)

[Verse 3]
The fuck is this shit? the fuck do you mean?
You, not a rapper bitch you a meme
Switch it on, I said hello
Get off these niggas
Do a barrel roll
You know i'm cabron ,you know I'm the boss
Fuck your bitch i don't know
I'm out of control
Blow it like an oboe
I'm not a clone its only me no dos
I like to kill rappers when i'm bored
From the surface to the core
Hellcat swervin' in the curve

[Chorus]
Bitch come and find me breaking borders (breaking borders)
(breaking borders)
(breaking borders)

[Bridge: Chester Bennington]
Give me the strength of the rising sun
Give me the truth of the words unsung
And when the last bells ring, the poor men sing
"Bring me to kingdom come"

[Interlude]
Book a flight to New York
Maybe I'm coming back maybe i don't
Maybe ill die alone
Maybe ill get my ass deported
No coming back fam i won't
Goodbye to my hoes, goodbye to my bros
This is my shot
Knock on that door
This is my shot, this is my shot


[Outro: Mike Shinoda]

I grind tough, sucker, make your mind up
Are you in the firing squad or are you in the lineup?
Bang, bang, little monkey man playing with the big guns
Only get you slain, I ain't playing, I'm just saying
You ain't got a sliver of a chance
I get iller, I deliver while you quiver in your pants
So shake, shake down, money, here's the breakdown
You can play the bank, I'mma play the bank takedown
And no mistakes now, I'm coming to get you
I'm just a Banksy, you're a brainwash
Get the picture?
It's like that
