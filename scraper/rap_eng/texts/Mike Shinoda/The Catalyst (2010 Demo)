God bless us every one
We're a broken people living under loaded gun
And it can't be outfought
It can't be outdone
It can't be outmatched
It can't be outrun
No

God bless us every one
We're a broken people living under loaded gun
And it can't be outfought
It can't be outdone
It can't be outmatched
It can't be outrun
No

And when I close my eyes tonight
To symphonies of blinding light
(God bless us every one / we're a broken people living under loaded gun)
Oh / like memories in cold decay
Transmissions echoing away
Far from the world of you and I
Where oceans bleed into the sky

God save us every one
Will we burn inside the fires of a thousand suns
For the sins of our hand
The sins of our tongue
The sins of our father
The sins of our young
No

God save us every one
Will we burn inside the fires of a thousand suns
For the sins of our hand
The sins of our tongue
The sins of our father
The sins of our young
No

And when I close my eyes tonight
To symphonies of blinding light
(God save us every one / will we burn inside the fires of a thousand suns)
Oh / like memories in cold decay
Transmissions echoing away
Far from the world of you and I
Where oceans bleed into the sky

Oh / like memories in cold decay
Transmissions echoing away
Far from the world of you and I
Where oceans bleed into the sky
