[Intro]
We'd like to play something for you that we worked up today
In the dressing room

[Verse 1]
Mama always told me don't you run
"Don't you run with scissors, son
You're gonna hurt someone"
Mama told me look before you leap
Always think before you speak, watch the friends you keep

[Pre-Chorus]
Stay along the beaten path, never listened when she said

[Chorus]
Sharp Edges have consequences, I
Guess that I had to find out for myself
Sharp Edges have consequences, now
Every scar is a story I can tell

[Verse 2]
Should've played it safer from the start
Loved you like a house of cards
Let it fall apart
But all the things I couldn't understand
Never could've planned
Made me who I am
Put your nose in paperbacks
Instead of smoking cigarettes
These are years you're never getting back

[Pre-Chorus]
Stay along the beaten path, never listened when she said

[Chorus]
Sharp Edges have consequences, I
Guess that I had to find out for myself
Sharp Edges have consequences, now
Every scar is a story I can tell

[Bridge]
We all fall down
We live somehow
We learn what doesn't kill us makes us stronger
We all fall down
We live somehow
We learn what doesn't kill us makes us stronger
Ooh ooh ooh, ooh ooh ooh, ooh ooh ooh

[Pre-Chorus]
Put along the beaten path, never listened when she said

[Chorus]
Sharp Edges have consequences, I
Guess that I had to find out for myself
Sharp Edges have consequences, now
Every scar is a story I can tell

[Outro 1]
We all fall down
We live somehow
We learn what doesn't kill us makes us stronger
We all fall down
We live somehow
We learn what doesn't kill us makes us stronger
Ooh ooh ooh, ooh ooh ooh, ooh ooh ooh

[Outro 2: Chester Bennington & Mike Shinoda]
Man, playing guitar and singing is really hard
Dude, Mike is back here, like, playing drums, playing keyboards, guitars, rapping, and I'm like, all five thumbs
*Laughter*
You wanna take a break from playing guitar and singing for a minute then?
What's that?
You wanna take a break from it, then?
Oh, no, I like playing guitar, it's super fun
I mean if you can't have fun doing this, you're doing it wrong, you know what I mean?
