[Intro: Mike Shinoda]
Even when it's not about you, about you
All of a sudden it's about you now, ooh
Even when it's not about you, about you
All of a sudden it's about you
Even when it's not about you, about you
All of a sudden it's about you now, ooh
Even when it's not about you, about you
All of a sudden it's about you

[Verse 1: Mike Shinoda]
This is that gather 'round it and wonder where I found it
This is that wake up make your agent have your tour re-routed
This is that drama comma pain and ainâ€™t no way around it
'Cause somehow still it's hard to know what I can say about it
I buckled up told myself to suck it up
I was scared to death to get up there and spill my fucking guts
I was saying pull your stupid self together buttercup
Get it crackin' Back in Black until you have em Thunderstruck
But

[Chorus: Mike Shinoda]
Even when it's not about you, about you
All of a sudden it's about you now, ooh
Even when it's not about you, about you
All of a sudden it's about you, about you

[Verse 2: Mike Shinoda]
No, there's not a single thing that I can say
Not a single solitary, every meaning changes shape
Even when there's no connection back to you in any line
All of a sudden it's about you and it gets me every time but
What the fuck is left to author anyway?
When I basically been writin' since the Raiders ran LA
I'm afraid that maybe I've said everything there is to say
Maybe I should make an exit while there're ways to get away, cause

[Bridge: Blackbear]
Can't find the words to a memory
But these are just words to a melody
Find something that works fits the symmetry
For only a quick broken remedy
And I'd give anything to choose
Pick out the words I bring home to you
How can I make do?
Put a smile on change my attitude
And even though it' not about you
Everything is all about you
All about you

[Chorus: Mike Shinoda]
Even when it's not about you, about you
All of a sudden it's about you now, ooh
Even when it's not about you, about you
All of a sudden it's about you now, ooh
Even when it's not about you, about you
All of a sudden it's about you now, ooh
Even when it's not about you, about you
All of a sudden it's about you, about you
Even when it's not about you, about you
All of a sudden it's about you now, ooh
Even when it's not about you, about you
All of a sudden it's about you now
Even when it's not about you, about you
All of a sudden it's about you now, ooh
Even when it's not about you, about you
All of a sudden it's about you, about you
