[Verse 1]
Don't think I need to say this
'Cause you know what's in my head
"Fucked up" is an understatement
Can't wait for this year to end
It all fell apart, don't know where to start
And everything moves so slow
I can't get a break, it's too much to take
But closing my eyes, I know

[Chorus]
When the world's on fire, all I need is you
I don't always think to say it but it's true
When I just wanna disappear, you're the one that keeps me here
The world's on fire, all I need is you

[Verse 2]
The riot's on the horizon
We're calling each other's bluff
The smoke's filling up the skies
And I say we should pack it up
Maybe the blaze will take this away
To ash and to earth below
You tell me to breathe, that you still believe
And, closing my eyes, I know

[Chorus]
When the world's on fire, all I need is you
I don't always think to say it but it's true
When I just wanna disappear, you're the one that keeps me here
The world's on fire, all I need is you

When the world's on fire, all I need is you
I don't always think to say it but it's true
When I just wanna disappear, you're the one that keeps me here
The world's on fire, all I need is you

[Outro]
The world's on fire, all I need is you
The world's on fire, all I need is you
