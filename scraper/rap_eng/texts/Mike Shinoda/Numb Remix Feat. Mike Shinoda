[Verse 1: Twisted Blizzard](Mike Shinoda)
I'm tired of being what you want me to be
Feeling so wasted, lost in between the faces
Don't know what you're expecting of me
Put aside the pressure of running into your demons
(Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow)
Every step that I take is another mistake I make
(Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow)

[Chorus: Twisted Blizzard]
I've become so numb, I can't feel you there
Become so torn apart, I can't feel my hands bare
I'm distancing myself, all I want to do
Is be more aware of my common mistakes towards you

[Verse 2: Twisted Blizzard](Mike Shinoda)
Can't you see that you're killing me
Holding too tightly, afraid to lose yourself?
'Cause everything that you thought I would be
Has fallen apart right in front of your eyes
(Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow)
Every step that I take is another mistake I make
(Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow)
And every lyric I write is more than I can take

[Chorus: Twisted Blizzard]
I've become so numb, I can't feel you there
Become so torn apart, I can't feel my hands bare
I'm distancing myself, all I want to do
Is be more aware of my common mistakes towards you

[Pre-Chorus: Twisted Blizzard]
And I know
I may end up falling off
But I know
You were just like me with someone hating on you

[Chorus: Twisted Blizzard]
I've become so numb, I can't feel you there
Become so torn apart, I can't feel my hands bare
I'm distancing myself, all I want to do
Is be more aware of my common mistakes towards you

[Outro: Twisted Blizzard](Mike Shinoda)
I've become so numb, I can't feel you there
(I'm tired of being what you want me to be)
I've erased myself, you can't see me now
(I'm tired of being what you want me to be)
