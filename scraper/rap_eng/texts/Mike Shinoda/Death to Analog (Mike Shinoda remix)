There's no right
To survive
Got to fight
Stay alive

Nothing's simple
Wanting, waiting
Nobody knows when the end is coming
Something seething
This inner meaning
Nobody knows where the flood is going

There's no right
To survive
Got to fight
Stay alive

Something seething
This inner meaning
Nobody knows where the flood is going
Nothing's simple
Wanting, waiting
Nobody knows when the end is coming

Motion

Upwards and downwards

There's no right
To survive
Got to fight
Stay alive

There's no right
To survive
Got to fight
Stay alive

There's no right
To survive
Got to fight
Stay alive
