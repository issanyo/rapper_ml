[Verse 1]
God bless us everyone
We're a broken people living under loaded gun
And it can't be outfought
It can't be outdone
It can't be outmatched
It can't be outrun, no!

[Pre-Chorus 1]
When I close my eyes tonight
To symphonies of blinding light!
God bless us everyone
We're a broken people living under loaded gun

[Chorus]
Like memories in cold decay
Transmissions echoing away
Far from the world of you and I
Where oceans bleed into the sky!

[Bridge 1]

[Verse 2] (x2)
God save us everyone
Will we burn inside the fires of a thousand suns?
For the sins of our hands
The sins of our tongues
The sins of our fathers
The sins of our young? No!

[Pre-Chorus 2]
And when I close my eyes tonight
To symphonies of blinding light!

[Chorus]
Oh, like memories in cold decay
Transmissions echoing away
Far from the world of you and I
Where oceans bleed into the sky!

[Bridge 2]

[Chorus]
Like memories in cold decay
Transmissions echoing away
Far from the world of you and I
Where oceans bleed into the sky!

[Instrumental + Outro]
Lift me up, let me go (x8)
Lift me up
