Mike Shinoda:

Me and Rakaa haven't begun to hit you yet
When I get you open, your insides will make you wet
You bet, hostile when I'm rapping to you
Got you asking, "God, how'd we let this happen to you"
Bringing on the fat lady and the fat man too
And shoot 'em both out of a cannon over Camandu
If you're sleeping, I'm knocking out the Sandman too
I'll beat the yellow out of you until you're black and blue
Laughed at you, and any emcee who wants to scuffle
Till the challenger is seeing the Challenger space shuttle
Emcees so mixed up, their bones are pulling muscles
And their bladder is leaking out and down their leg into a puddle
What's that? Laying you flat, survival tactically
You wanna battle me? You better start thinking practically
Line after line, casually rhyming this rapidly
Anonymous, you never get a chance to bust back at me
