[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
It's easier to run
Replacing this pain with something numb
It's so much easier to go
Than face all this pain here all alone

[Verse 1: Chester Bennington]
Something has been taken
From deep inside of me
A secret I've kept locked away
No one can ever see

Wounds so deep, they never show
They never go away
Like moving pictures in my head
For years and years they've played

[Pre-Chorus: Mike Shinoda, Mike & Chester]
If I could change, I would, take back the pain, I would
Retrace every wrong move that I made, I would
If I could stand up and take the blame, I would
If I could take all the shame to the grave, I would

If I could change, I would, take back the pain, I would
Retrace every wrong move that I made, I would
If I could stand up and take the blame, I would
I would take all my shame to the grave

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
It's easier to run
Replacing this pain with something numb
It's so much easier to go
Than face all this pain here all alone

[Verse 2: Chester Bennington]
Sometimes, I remember
The darkness of my past
Bringing back these memories
I wish I didn't have

Sometimes, I think of letting go
And never looking back
And never moving forward, so
There'd never be a past

[Pre-Chorus: Mike Shinoda, Mike & Chester]
If I could change, I would, take back the pain, I would
Retrace every wrong move that I made, I would
If I could stand up and take the blame, I would
If I could take all the shame to the grave, I would

If I could change, I would, take back the pain, I would
Retrace every wrong move that I made, I would
If I could stand up and take the blame, I would
I would take all my shame to the grave

[Bridge: Chester Bennington]
Just washing it aside
All of the helplessness inside
Pretending I don't feel misplaced
Is so much simpler than change

[Chorus: Chester]
It's easier to run
Replacing this pain with something numb
It's so much easier to go
Than face all this pain here all alone

[Outro: Chester Bennington & Mike Shinoda]
It's easier to run
If I could change, I would, take back the pain, I would
Retrace every wrong move that I made
It's easier to go

If I could change, I would, take back the pain, I would
Retrace every wrong move that I made, I would
If I could stand up and take the blame, I would
I would take all my shame to the grave
