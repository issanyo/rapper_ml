[Verse 1: Mike Shinoda]
When I pretend everything is what I want it to be
I look exactly like what you had always wanted to see
When I pretend, I can forget about the criminal I am
Stealing second after second, just 'cause I know I can

[Pre-Chorus: Mike Shinoda & Chester Bennington]
But, I can't pretend this is the way it'll stay
I'm just (Trying to bend the truth)
I can't pretend I'm who you want me to be
So I'm (Lying my way from)

[Chorus: Chester Bennington & Mike Shinoda]
You (No, no turning back, now)
I wanna be pushed aside, so let me go
(No, no turning back, now)
Let me take back my life
I’d rather be all alone (No turning back, now)
Anywhere on my own, 'cause I can see
(No, no turning back, now)
The very worst part of you is me

[Verse 2: Mike Shinoda]
I remember what they taught to me
Remember condescending talk of who I ought to be
Remember listening to all of that and this, again
So, I pretended up a person who was fitting in

[Pre-Chorus: Mike Shinoda & Chester Bennington]
And now, you think this person really is me
And I'm (Trying to bend the truth)
But the more I push, the more I'm pulling away
'Cause I'm (Lying my way from)

[Chorus: Chester Bennington & Mike Shinoda]
You (No, no turning back, now)
I wanna be pushed aside, so let me go
(No, no turning back, now)
Let me take back my life
I’d rather be all alone (No turning back, now)
Anywhere on my own, 'cause I can see
(No, no turning back, now)
The very worst part of you
The very worst part of you is me

[Bridge: Mike Shinoda & Chester Bennington]
This isn't what I wanted to be
I never thought that what I said
Would have you running from me, like this
This isn't what I wanted to be
I never thought that what I said
Would have you running from me, like this
(This) This isn't what I wanted to be
I never thought that what I said
Would have you running from me, like this
(This) This isn't what I wanted to be
I never thought that what I said
Would have you running from me, like this

[Chorus: Chester Bennington & Mike Shinoda]
You (No turning back, now)
I wanna be pushed aside, so let me go
(No, no turning back, now)
Let me take back my life
I’d rather be all alone (No turning back, now)
Anywhere on my own, 'cause I can see
(No, no turning back, now)
The very worst part of you
The very worst part of you is me
