[Intro: Chester Bennington]
Shut up when I'm talking to you!
Shut up!
Shut up!
I'm talking to you!

[Verse 1: Chester Bennington]
I cannot take this anymore
Saying everything I've said before
All these words they make no sense
I find bliss in ignorance
Less I hear, the less you'll say
You'll find that out anyway

[Pre-Chorus: Chester Bennington]
Just like before…

[Chorus 1: Chester Bennington & Mike Shinoda]
Everything you say to me
(Takes me One Step Closer to the edge
And I'm about to break)
I need a little room to breathe
('Cause I'm One Step Closer to the edge
I'm about to break)

[Verse 2: Chester Bennington]
I find the answers aren't so clear
Wish I could find a way to disappear
All these thoughts they make no sense
I find bliss in ignorance
Nothing seems to go away
Over and over again

[Pre-Chorus: Chester Bennington]
Just like before…

[Chorus 2: Chester Bennington & Mike Shinoda]
Everything you say to me
(Takes me One Step Closer to the edge
And I'm about to break)
I need a little room to breathe
('Cause I'm One Step Closer to the edge
I'm about to break)
Everything you say to me
(Takes me One Step Closer to the edge
And I'm about to break)
I need a little room to breathe
('Cause I'm One Step Closer to the edge
And I'm about to…
Break!)

[Bridge: Chester Bennington]
Shut up when I'm talking to you!
Shut up!
Shut up!
Shut up!
Shut up when I'm talking to you!
Shut up!
Shut up!
Shut up!
Shut up!
I'm about to break!

[Chorus 2: Chester Bennington & Mike Shinoda]
Everything you say to me
(Takes me One Step Closer to the edge
And I'm about to break)
I need a little room to breathe
('Cause I'm One Step Closer to the edge
I'm about to break)
Everything you say to me
(Takes me One Step Closer to the edge
And I'm about to break)
I need a little room to breathe
('Cause I'm One Step Closer to the edge
And I'm about to…
Break!)
