[Verse 1]
You say that you're proud of me, oh
Then you take something out of me
So predictable

[Pre-Chorus]
Why do I have to see this through?
Why do I have to take this?
Isn't there something I can do
To make myself finally say this?

[Chorus]
No, you've taken this too far
Exposing who you are, for all to see
You're not the one that you pretend to be

[Verse 2]
You start with apologies, oh
Then take another shot at me
So predictable

[Pre-Chorus]
Why do I have to see this through
Why do I have to take this
Isn't there something I can do
To make myself finally say this

[Chorus]
No, you've taken this too far
Exposing who you are, for all to see
You're not the one that you pretend...

This, no, you've taken this too far
Exposing who you are, for all to see
You're not the one that you pretend to be

No, you've taken this too far
Exposing who you are, for all to see
You're not the one that you pretend...

This, no, you've taken this too far
Exposing who you are, for all to see
You're not the one that you pretend to be
