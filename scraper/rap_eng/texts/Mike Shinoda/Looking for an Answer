[Verse 1]
There's an emptiness tonight
A hole that wasn't there before
And I keep reaching for the light
But I can't find it anymore
There's an emptiness tonight
A heavy hand that pulls me down
They say it's gonna be alright
But can't begin to tell me how

[Pre-Chorus]
And I ask myself out loud...

[Chorus]
"Have I been lost all along?
Was there something I could say, or something I should not have done?
Was I lost all along?
Was I looking for an answer when there never really was one?
Was I looking for an answer when there never really was one?"

[Verse 2]
Is there sunshine where you are?
The way there was when you were here
'Cause I'm just sitting in the dark
In disbelief that this is real
In disbelief that this is real

[Chorus]
Have I been lost all along?
Was there something I could say or something I should not have done?
Was I lost all along?
Was I looking for an answer when there never really was one?
Was I looking for an answer when there never really was one?

[Pre-Chorus]
And I ask myself out loud...

[Chorus]
"Have I been lost all along?
Was there something I could say or something I should not have done?
Was I lost all along?
Was I looking for an answer when there never really was one?
Was I looking for an answer when there never really was one?"
