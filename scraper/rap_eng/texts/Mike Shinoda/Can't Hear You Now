[Chorus]
You can call till your voice is running out
But I can't hear you now, I can't hear you now
I'm somewhere far away, where you can't bring me down
So I can't hear you now, I can't hear you now

[Verse 1]
Run, run it back, tell 'em what I'm coming at
I was on that bullshit then, now I'm done with that
Scared of what I didn't want, scared of what I wanted
And thought that I was finished but I hardly had begun, in fact
I'm a beast, I'm a monster, a savage
And any other metaphor the culture can imagine
And I got a caption for anybody asking
That is, "I am feeling fucking fantastic"

[Pre-Chorus]
Some days, it doesn't take much to bring me down
Some days, I'm struggling for control
Some days, it doesn't take much to bring me down
Right now, I'm floating above it all

[Chorus]
So you can call till your voice is running out
But I can't hear you now, I can't hear you now
I'm somewhere far away, where you can't bring me down
So I can't hear you now, I can't hear you now

[Verse 2]
Come, come again, feel it when it's flooding in
Woke up knowing I don't have to be numb again
Starting line scratched out, I don't have to run again
Give-a-fucks maxxed out, tell 'em I'm not coming in
I'm not present on the payroll
And you can tell me how I should do it 'cause you say so
But I'm not dancing to the rhythm you replay, no
'Cause I'm already half-a-million miles away, though, they know

[Pre-Chorus]
Some days, it doesn't take much to bring me down
Some days, I'm struggling for control
Some days, it doesn't take much to bring me down
Right now, I'm floating above it all

[Chorus]
So you can call till your voice is running out
But I can't hear you now, I can't hear you now
I'm somewhere far away, where you can't bring me down
So I can't hear you now, I can't hear you now

[Bridge]
And I waited too long
I listened too much
You said what can't be unheard
I'm drawing a line
Enough is enough
I let you have your last word

[Chorus]
So you can call 'til your voice is running out
But I can't hear you now, I can't hear you now
I'm somewhere far away, where you can't bring me down
So I can't hear you now, I can't hear you now
So you can call till your voice is running out
But I can't hear you now, I can't hear you now
I'm somewhere far away, where you can't bring me down
So I can't hear you now, I can't hear you now
