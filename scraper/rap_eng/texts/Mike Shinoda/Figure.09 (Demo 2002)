[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
All these things I could not say
Made me so much more afraid
Just too scared of what I'd find
To look behind, to look behind

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
All these things I could not say
Made me so much more afraid
Just too scared of what I'd find
To look behind, to look behind

[Bridge: Chester Bennington & Mike Shinoda]
If you go, there's no turning back
If you go, there's no turning back
If you go, there's no turning back
There's no turning back

No, no, no, no, no, no...
No, no turning back!
No, no turning back!
No, no turning back!
No, no turning back!

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
All these things I could not say
Made me so much more afraid
Just too scared of what I'd find
To look behind

All of these things I could not say
Made me so much more afraid
Just too scared of what I'd find
To look behind, can't look behind!
