[Verse 1: Mike Shinoda]
In the center of the silence, the violent thoughts
Are thrown through the thick smoke
And flickering lights that brighten the room
All the things that you wanted to say get lost and thrown away

You can fade and hesitate to speak your mind
Can't turn back when you cross the line
Sometimes, it's someone you know who just doesn't care
Has to see you go to know you were there

[Pre-Chorus: Mike Shinoda]
This is the sun behind the rain
Even though sometimes, I feel I can't stand another minute
May've begun to run an endless race
But, I never looked back when I begin it

I know that this is the sun behind the rain
Even though sometimes, I feel I can't stand another minute
May've begun to run an endless race
But, I never looked back when I begin it

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
I know all of this will soon be gone
You don't really have to prove them wrong

[Verse 2: Mike Shinoda]
Sometimes, you've got no control of where you go
Taking down a road you don't know
And you feel so lost that you wanna hide your face
You don't recognize the place your in

Sometimes, the sun doesn't shine your way
Sometimes, the night doesn't turn to day
But sometimes, the light's so bright
It burns through the night and keeps the darkness at bay
(Run away)

[Pre-Chorus: Mike Shinoda]
This is the sun behind the rain
Even though sometimes, I feel I can't stand another minute
May've begun to run an endless race
But, I never looked back when I begin it

I know that this is the sun behind the rain
Even though sometimes, I feel I can't stand another minute
May've begun to run an endless race
But, I never looked back when I begin it

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
I know all of this will soon be gone
You don't really have to prove them wrong
I know soon enough, you'll make them see
You'll be far away from them, with me

[Bridge: Mike Shinoda]
Follow the link in the chain without a name
Seal the light and the darkened days remains
Taken away from the place you've been trapped
Break all you know, then bring it all back

[Pre-Chorus: Mike Shinoda & Chester Bennington]
This is the sun behind the rain
Even though sometimes, I feel I can't stand another minute
May've begun to run an endless race
But, I never looked back when I begin it

I know that this is the sun behind the rain
Even though sometimes, I feel I can't stand another minute
May've begun to run an endless race
But, I never looked back when I begin it

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
I know all of this will soon be gone
You don't really have to prove them wrong
I know soon enough, you'll make them see
You'll be far away from them, with me
