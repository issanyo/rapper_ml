I break down, fear is sinking in
The cold comes, racing through my skin
Searching for a way to get to you through the storm

You go, giving up your home
Go, leaving all you’ve known, you are not alone

With arms up, stretched into the sky
With eyes like echoes in the night
Hiding from the hell that you’ve been through, silent one

You go, giving up your home
Go, leaving all you’ve known
You go, giving up your home
Go, leaving all you’ve known, you are not alone

You go, giving up your home
Go, leaving all you’ve known
You go, giving up your home
Go, you are not unknown, you are not alone
You are not unknown, you are not alone
