[Verse 1]
If everything would just stop
Then maybe I could collect my thoughts
If everything would stand still
I could've hidden how lost I feel

[Pre-Chorus]
I should've said what I hear
I should've let myself fear
I should've made myself clear

[Chorus]
So this is how we fall apart
This is how the ending starts
And when we find we lost our marks
We fake what we don't know

[Verse 2]
I never asked to let go
I never thought I could sink so low
I never let myself down
Until the second I did right now

[Pre-Chorus]
I should've said what I hear
I should've let myself fear
I should've made myself clear

[Chorus]
So this is how we fall apart
This is how the ending starts
And when we find we lost our marks
We fake what we don't know

So this is how we fall apart
This is how the ending starts
'Cause when our heads betray our hearts
We fake what we don't know

[Bridge]
'Cause all we are is everything we've done
All we are is how quickly we run
And all we are
We are

[Interlude]
This is how we fall apart
But this is how beginnings start
Cause when our heads betray our hearts
We fake what we don't know

And if our doubt begins again
The answers find us in the end
So in the meantime, we'll pretend
And fake what we don't know

[Chorus]
This is how we fall apart
But this is how beginnings start
Cause when our heads betray our hearts
We fake what we don't know

And if our doubt begins again
The answers find us in the end
So in the meantime, we'll pretend
And fake what we don't know
