[Intro: Laura Olsher]
Of course, you know what a fuse is
It's a long piece of cord impregnated with gun powder
When you strike a match and light it
It burns, fitfully, spiraling to it's end
At which, there is a little surprise

[Verse 1: Mike Shinoda]
From the planet of Krypton
Ensuring super-emcees, you'll be ripped on
You fell off and it's my lyric sheet you slipped on
Get gone, spit on mics made in Hong Kong
Rock on, sing songs more mightier than King Kong
Or Donkey Kong

You think you want me or want this?
You want some? Hold your reputation for ransom
With these here, handsomely crafted tactics
To break a snake emcee like a cheap prophylactic

Galactic, spaced-out gabbing grabs attention
Got heads nodding like a Pez Candy convention
Briar patch raps gash tracks in sections
Kid says this and need witness protection

[Chorus 1: Mark Wakefield]
Trying to say what I can't be saying
I'll be here
Trying to say what I can't be saying
I'll be here

[Verse 2: Mike Shinoda]
Yo, dig this, dig this

Yo, it's the junkyard, crooked letter C-I-EN-tific
Duck us, the ruckus I'll bring stings your eardrum
Hear one line I let loose, find me fearsome
Opposing troops on my home front shall be gone

Testing the eight hundred-eighteenth battalion
Shall I go on? Crews run like rebels
Enola Gay rhymes kick the notch up a level in intensity
Send back attacks that you sent to me

Blow up your spot with grenades that were meant for me
Empty three verses on thirty-three emcees
Swiss cheese your gear, putting shrapnel in the breeze
Bleed emcees of enemy companies

With my hand full of lyrics, talking ‘bout, you want these?
Please, don’t even speak the name of Ken
On some go-go-Gadget mic shit
Put it down like pens for my friends and my fam

Better Dodge, or I’ll Ram
This mic shaft through the back of an emcee’s hand
With the strength of He-Man, a Cringer don’t want that
Close-bodies fill fields in hand-to-hand combat

Battle cats in cypher sessions of speech
Warfare of words flashing that cordless heat
Compete for an edge, lyrical shots get lit
Don’t question my intention when your bucket gets kicked

[Chorus 1: Mark Wakefield]
; Trying to say what I can't be saying
I'll be here (Teflon metallic, syllaballic attacks)
Trying to say what I can't be saying
I'll be here (Haunt emcees with these lyrical back smacks)

[Bridge: Mark Wakefield]
Should've told you so

Why wait? I shouldn't have told you so
Why wait? I shouldn't have told you so
Why wait? I shouldn't have told you so
Why wait? I shouldn't have told you so

Why wait? I shouldn't have told you so
Why wait? I shouldn't have told you so
Why wait? I shouldn't have told you so
Why wait? I shouldn't have told you so

[Chorus 2: Mark Wakefield & Mike Shinoda]
Trying to say what I can't be saying
I'll be here (Teflon metallic, syllaballic attacks)
Trying to say what I can't be saying
I'll be here (Haunt emcees with these lyrical back smacks)
