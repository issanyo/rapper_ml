[Verse 1: Chester Bennington]
I've lied to you
The same way that I always do
This is the last smile
That I'll fake for the sake of being with you

[Pre-Chorus: Chester & Mike Shinoda]
(Everything falls apart, even the people
Who never frown eventually break down)
The sacrifice of hiding in a lie
(Everything has to end, you'll soon find
We're out of time left to watch it all unwind)
The sacrifice is never knowing

[Chorus: Chester]
Why I never walked away, why I played myself this way
Now, I see your testing me pushes me away
Why I never walked away, why I played myself this way
Now, I see your testing me pushes me away

[Verse 2: Chester]
I've tried, like you
To do everything you wanted to
This is the last time
I'll take the blame for the sake of being with you

[Pre-Chorus: Chester & Mike]
(Everything falls apart, even the people
Who never frown eventually break down)
The sacrifice of hiding in a lie
(Everything has to end, you'll soon find
We're out of time left to watch it all unwind)
The sacrifice is never knowing

[Chorus: Chester]
Why I never walked away, why I played myself this way
Now, I see your testing me pushes me away
Why I never walked away, why I played myself this way
Now, I see your testing me pushes me away

[Bridge: Chester & Mike]
(We're all out of time
This is how we find how it all unwinds)
The sacrifice of hiding in a lie
(We're all out of time
This is how we find how it all unwinds)
The sacrifice is never knowing

[Chorus: Chester]
Why I never walked away, why I played myself this way
Now, I see your testing me pushes me away
Why I never walked away, why I played myself this way
Now, I see your testing me pushes me away
