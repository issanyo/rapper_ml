[Verse 1]
She had never really understood
She demanded her respect
Twenty years of falling under foot
Twenty reasons to regret

You would look for what you couldn't see
Scared to be what she became
She would tell you what you couldn't be
And why you had yourself to blame

[Pre-Chorus]
Alone again, you try to disappear
And hold it in, pretending not to hear

[Chorus]
This voice without a sound
Voice that tears you down
You're trying not to fear, saying this is in your head
But it whispers in your ear, saying this is what you get

[Verse 2]
She was ready with your penalty
When eventually, you'd fall
She was there, inside your memory
Saying this was all your fault

[Pre-Chorus]
Alone again, you try to disappear
And hold it in, pretending not to hear

[Chorus]
This voice without a sound
Voice that tears you down
You're trying not to fear, saying this is in your head
But it whispers in your ear, saying this is what you get

[Melodic Bridge]

[Pre-Chorus]
Alone again, you try to disappear
And hold it in, pretending not to hear

[Chorus]
This voice without a sound
Voice that tears you down
You're trying not to fear, saying this is in your head
But it whispers in your ear, saying this is what you get

[Outro]
This voice without a sound
Voice without a sound
This voice without a sound
Voice without a sound
