(Always prevail, the human third rail)
Yo, yo
(Exhale the smoke from Molotov cocktails)
Junkyard Scientific, Styles, haha
(Always prevail, the human third rail)
Yo, I thought you knew, I thought, ha, uh
(Exhale the smoke from Molotov cocktails)
I tell ya, ha, uh

It's like a royal flush, a rush when I bust verbally
Plus crush Earth's crust and enemy emcees to dust, with one touch
Stonehenge rhyme riddle a mystery
With Earth-rattle reckoning, rewriting your history
With blistery flesh, meshed with a mess of a civil unrest on wax
Test pressed, scratched with finesse and next
Blessed with extra-terrestrial techs and programmed for the organs above your necks
Undressing hip hop and making it over again
This is the end, ill men you'll never defend
From the deep end we watch trends and then we see rock
And devise plans, strand them in the penalty box
To mentally stop brains of virtual train wrecks
Dissect the picture to the words turned up by the text
What's next? Heat seeking treats meet your sect
When you spit a thousand words and haven't painted a stroke yet

Believe this, I'm only in it for the fiends
And mean every single sentence that I scream
It's just the sound as the breakbeat kicks
That's got us all dancing in the mist
Believe this, I'm only in it for the fiends
And mean every single sentence that I scream
It's just the sound as the breakbeat kicks
That's got us all dancing in the mist

With your incomphrehensible bullet-hole ventilators
Stainless steel metal invincible diamond and platinum-plated
Psychologically fabricated facade godsent and hellbent
Are mentally not making any sense to me
Eventually you tempted me to put you on the chopping block
As a sacrifice to hip-hop when I knock you off
A razor blade and pop and lock the axe in
Put your head in a basket as an example for those who pass it
Medievally approaching these festivities
Jump around frequently when you see me, like BDP on PCP
Frequently me and Mark transform like DMC
To soundwaves of song set in every frequency

(Always prevail, the human third rail)
Endlessly worthless, crying out your curses
(Exhale the smoke from Molotov cocktails)
Playing all these games and turning this into a circus
(Always prevail, the human third rail)
Witless, worthless, crying out your curses
(Exhale the smoke from Molotov cocktails)
Playing all these games...

Believe this, I'm only in it for the fiends
And mean every single sentence that I scream
It's just the sound as the breakbeat kicks
That's got us all dancing in the mist
Believe this, I'm only in it for the fiends
And mean every single sentence that I scream
It's just the sound as the breakbeat kicks
That's got us all dancing in the mist

(Always prevail, the human third rail, I exhale the smoke from Molotov cocktails)
One two, one, one, yeah, one two
(Always prevail, the human third rail, I exhale the smoke from Molotov cocktails)
Ha, ha, ha, Cash Double-Oh, Xero, 818, you know? That's how we do
(Always prevail, the human third rail, I exhale the smoke from Molotov cocktails)
Xero, 818, you know? That's how we do
(Always prevail, the human third rail, I exhale the smoke from Molotov cocktails)
Yeah, check it out, y'all, check it out, Cash Double-Oh
Tell your grandparents, tell your brother and sister, tell everybody, ha
One two, ha, ha, one two, ha, one two
Just like that
Yo, can you hear me?
