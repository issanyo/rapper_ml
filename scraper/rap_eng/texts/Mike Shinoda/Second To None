[Verse 1: Mike Shinoda]
It's the real authentic, leave ya'll dented
Forget what ya heard--if I said it, I meant it
Did it for real, while ya'll pretended
Back for more, startin' the war to end it
Raw, rippin' like I'm working a chainsaw
From New York to Cali, New Jersey to Crenshaw
Speak the gift while you plead the fifth
My team is sick, we eat, sleep, and breathe this shit
Rough and rugged, kill 'em soft
We don't leave one standin' when we breakin' 'em off
Takin' a loss, not a chance in your life
If being fresh is wrong, I don't wanna be right
Stop, drop, and roll, we got soul
Safety popped off when we lock and load
So, this how we get this done
You can check on the rep--yep, second to none

[Chorus]
Check on the rep, second to none, yea
This how we get this done
You can check on the rep, second to none
Check on the rep, second to none, yea
This how we get this done
You can check on the rep, second to none

[Verse 2: Ryu]
Yo, check the rep, yep, enough respect
If not for the jewels I drop, the chunky neck
I'm funky fresh, equipped with a rusty Tek
Am I the best--well I gotta put it bluntly, yes
You can't touch me, the flows'll get ya
Squeeze breath outta your chest like boa constrictors
I'm a killer and I usually know my victims
So I catch a lot of bodies on the homie system, uh
Don't get it twisted, I'll break your jaw
You'll be sippin' fried chicken through a crazy straw
Liquid diet, bitch--we official pirates
I ghost ride the ghost ship, drinkin' and drivin'
Yeah, you ain't nothing but a whiny kid
That cries like a wimp cause nobody rides with him
I ain't a thug, pimp, gangsta or grimy dun
But you can check on the rep--yep, second to none

[Chorus]
Check on the rep, second to none, yea
This how we get this done
You can check on the rep, second to none
Check on the rep, second to none, yea
This how we get this done
You can check on the rep, second to none

[Verse 3: Tak]
You know the biz when I step in the gate
You can find me at the gym bench pressing the weights
Getting' diesel on that ass and I'm so disgusting
I'ma tell the whole god dang globe to suck it
I'm bad, now you feelin' something surround you
My chemical mix, they got you pumpin' the Valium
The audience exposed and they had a reaction
Similar to explosions off of battery acid
My rhymes a razor to slash your neck with
So follow my trail path to Winnekta Exit
Into the dungeon, what you bringin' a bucket
No one's hearin' your screams, so start playin' the trumpet
I'm outta your reach now, so give me some rocket fuel
Hooked up with BeatDown and did the impossible
A couple of months later, the record was done
So you can check on the rep--yep, second to none

[Chorus]
Check on the rep, second to none, yea
This how we get this done
You can check on the rep, second to none
Check on the rep, second to none, yea
This how we get this done
You can check on the rep, second to none
