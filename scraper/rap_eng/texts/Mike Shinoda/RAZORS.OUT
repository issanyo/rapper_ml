[Verse 1]
Closing in
I hear the voices
Haunting us
Echo voices

[Pre-Chorus]
Remove the frame and focus in
As I begin to wave
You pretend to take the scene
And I'll pretend to pray

[Chorus]
From the top, to the end
You've got your razors out
To the end, till you stop
You cut the frames apart

[Verse 2]
Frozen I
Can hear the voices
Controlling our fate
Echo voices

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus (x2)]
