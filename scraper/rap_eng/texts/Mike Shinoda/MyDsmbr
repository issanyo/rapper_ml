[Verse 1: Chester Bennington and Mike Shinoda]
This is my December
This is my time of the year
This is my December
This is all so clear

(Just wish that I didn't feel
Like there was something I missed)
(Just wish that I didn't feel
Like there was something I missed)

[Verse 2: Chester]
This is my December
This is my snow-covered home
This is my December
This is me, alone

[Pre-Chorus: Chester and Mike]
And I (Just wish that I didn't feel
Like there was something I missed)
And I (Take back all the things I said
To make you feel like that)

And I (Just wish that I didn't feel
Like there was something I missed)
And I (Take back all the things
That I said to you)

[Chorus: Chester & Kelli Ali]
And I'd give it all away
Just to have somewhere to go to
Give it all away
To have someone to come home to

[Verse 3: Chester]
This is my December
These are my snow-covered trees
This is me pretending
This is all I need

[Pre-Chorus: Chester and Mike]
And I (Just wish that I didn't feel
Like there was something I missed)
And I (Take back all the things I said
To make you feel like that)

And I (Just wish that I didn't feel
Like there was something I missed)
And I (Take back all the things
That I said to you)

[Chorus: Chester & Kelli]
And I'd give it all away
Just to have somewhere to go to
Give it all away
To have someone to come home to

[Bridge: Chester]
This is my December
This is my time of the year
This is my December
This is all so clear

[Chorus: Chester & Kelli]
Give it all away
Just to have somewhere to go to
Give it all away
To have someone to come home to

Give it all away
Just to have somewhere to go to
Give it all away
To have someone to come home to
