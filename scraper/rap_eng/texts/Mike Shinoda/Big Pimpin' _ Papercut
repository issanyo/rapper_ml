[Intro: Jay-Z & Mike Shinoda]
*Laughing*
You wastin' your talent, Randy!
Yeah, ready?

[Chorus 1: Mike Shinoda]
It's like I'm paranoid lookin' over my back
It's like a whirlwind inside of my head
It's like I can't stop what I'm hearing within
It's like the face inside is right…

[Verse 1: Mike Shinoda & (Chester Bennington)]
Why does it look like night today?
Something inside's not right today
Why am I so uptight today?
Paranoia's all I got left
I don't know what stressed me first
Or how the pressure was fed
But I know just what it feels like
To have a voice in the back of my head
It's like a face that I hold inside
Face that awakes when I close my eyes
Face that watches every time they lie
Face that laughs every time they fall
(And watches everything)
So you know that when it's time to sink or swim
That the face inside is hearing me
Right underneath my skin

[Chorus 1: Mike Shinoda]
It's like I'm paranoid lookin' over my back
It's like a whirlwind inside of my head
It's like I can't stop what I'm hearing within
It's like the face inside is right…

[Verse 2: Jay-Z]
You know I thug 'em, fuck 'em, love 'em, leave 'em
'Cause I don't fuckin' need 'em
Take 'em out the hood, keep 'em lookin' good
But I don't fuckin' feed 'em
First time they fuss I'm breezin'
Talkin' 'bout, "What's the reasons?"
I'm a pimp in every sense of the word, bitch
Better trust than believe 'em
In the cut where I keep 'em
'Til I need a nut, 'til I need to beat the guts
Then it's, "beep beep" and I'm pickin' 'em up
Let 'em play with the dick in the truck
Many chicks wanna put Jigga fist in cuffs
Divorce him and split his bucks
Just because you got good head, I'ma break bread
So you can be livin' it up?
Shit, I parts with nothin', y'all be frontin'
Me give my heart to a woman?
Not for nothin', never happen
I'll be forever mackin'
Heart cold as assassins, I got no passion
I got no patience
And I hate waitin'
Ho get yo' ass in
And let's ri-i-i-i-i-ide
Check 'em out now
Ri-i-i-i-i-ide, yeah
Let's ri-i-i-i-i-ide
Check 'em out now
Ri-i-i-i-i-ide, yeah

[Chorus 2: Jay-Z]
We doin' Big Pimpin', we spendin' cheese
(Check 'em out now)
Big Pimpin', on B.L.A.D.'s
We doin' Big Pimpin' up in NYC
It's just that Jigga Man, Pimp C, and B-U-N-B
(Yo, yo, yo!) Big Pimpin', spendin' cheese
We doin' Big Pimpin', on B.L.A.D.'s
We doin' Big Pimpin' up in NYC
It's just that Jigga Man, Pimp C, and B-U-N-B (B-B)
