[Intro: Mike Shinoda]
Forfeit the game before somebody else
Takes you out of the frame and puts your name to shame
Cover up your face, you can't run the race
The pace is to fast, you just won't last

[Verse 1: Chester Bennington]
You love the way I look at you
While taking pleasure in the awful things you put me through
You take away, if I give in
My life, my pride is broken

[Chorus: Mike Shinoda]
Forfeit the game before somebody else
Takes you out of the frame and puts your name to shame
Cover up your face, you can't run the race
The pace is to fast, you just won't last

Forfeit the game before somebody else
Takes you out of the frame and puts your name to shame
Cover up your face, you can't run the race
The pace is to fast, you just won't last

[Verse 2: Chester Bennington]
I won't believe a word you say
I'm cut to pieces by the sound of every breath you take
I'm swimming through a sea of hurt
My life, my pride is stronger

[Chorus: Mike Shinoda]
Forfeit the game before somebody else
Takes you out of the frame and puts your name to shame
Cover up your face, you can't run the race
The pace is to fast, you just won't last

Forfeit the game before somebody else
Takes you out of the frame and puts your name to shame
Cover up your face, you can't run the race
The pace is to fast, you just won't last

[Bridge: Mike Shinoda & Chester Bennington]
It's time to sink or swim
It's time to sink or swim
It's time to sink or swim
To see who gets scared when the lights go dim

(No!) It's time to sink or swim
(No!) To see who gets scared when the lights go dim
(No!) It's time to sink or swim
(No!) To see who gets scared when the lights go dim

[Chorus: Mike Shinoda]
Forfeit the game before somebody else
Takes you out of the frame and puts your name to shame
Cover up your face, you can't run the race
The pace is to fast, you just won't last

Forfeit the game before somebody else
Takes you out of the frame and puts your name to shame
Cover up your face, you can't run the race
The pace is to fast, you just won't last
