[Verse 1]
Oh my sun it won't shine
It won't light up the back of my mind
And these fires they won't burn
But to blacken the memories I've earned

[Pre-Chorus 1]
And these walls are so thin
But they somehow keep holding me in
'Cause I've pushed and I know
What's to come at the end of this road

[Hook]
'Cause it goes through, ooh, ooh, ooh

[Verse 2]
Well, my sun it won't shine
It won't light up the back of my mind
And these fires they don't burn
Except to blacken the memories I've earned

[Pre-Chorus 2]
And these walls are so thin
But they keep on holding me in
'Cause I've pushed and I know
That there's nowhere left to go

[Hook (x2)]
'Cause it goes through, ooh, ooh, ooh

[Instrumental]

[Hook (x2)]
'Cause it goes through, ooh
