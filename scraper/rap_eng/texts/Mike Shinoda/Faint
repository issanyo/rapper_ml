[Linkin Park cover]

[Verse 1]
I am
A little bit of loneliness
A little bit of disregard
Handful of complaints
But I can't help the fact
That everyone can see these scars
I am
What I want you to want
What I want you to feel
But, it's like no matter what I do
I can't convince you
To just believe this is real

[Pre-Chorus]
So, I let go
Watching you
Turn your back like you always do
Face away and pretend that I'm not
But, I'll be here
'Cause you're all that I got

[Chorus]
I can't feel
The way I did, before
Don't turn your back on me
I won't be ignored!
Time won't heal
This damage anymore
Don't turn your back on me
I won't be ignored!

[Verse 2]
I am
A little bit insecure
A little unconfident
'Cause you don't understand
I do what I can
But sometimes, I don't make sense
I am
What you never wanna say
But, I've never had a doubt
It's like no matter what I do
I can't convince you
For once, just to hear me out

[Pre-Chorus]
So, I let go
Watching you
Turn your back like you always do
Face away and pretend that I'm not
But, I'll be here
'Cause you're all that I've got

[Chorus]
I can't feel
The way I did, before
Don't turn your back on me
I won't be ignored!
Time won't heal
This damage anymore
Don't turn your back on me
I won't be ignored!

[Bridge]
No!
Hear me out, now!
You're gonna listen to me
Like it or not
Right now!
Hear me out, now!
You're gonna listen to me
Like it or not
Right now!
I can't feel
The way I did before
Don't turn your back on me
I won't be ignored!

[Chorus]
I can't feel
The way I did, before
Don't turn your back on me
I won't be ignored!
Time won't heal
This damage anymore
Don't turn your back on me
I won't be ignored!

[Outro]
I can't feel…
Don't turn your back on me
I won't be ignored!
Time won't heal…
Don't turn your back on me
I won't be ignored!
