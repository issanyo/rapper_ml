I don't have a leg to stand on
Spinning like a whirlwind nothing to land on
Came so far never thought it'd be done now
Stuck in a holding pattern waiting to come down
Did somebody else define me?
Can I put the past behind me?
Do I even have a decision
Feeling like I'm living in a story already written
Am I part of a vision made by somebody else?
Pointing fingers at villains but I'm the villain myself
Or am I out of conviction with no wind in the sail?
Too focused on the end and simply ready to fail
'Cause I'm tired of the fear that I can't control this
I'm tired of feeling like every next step's hopeless
I'm tired of being scared what I build might break apart
I don't want to know the end, all I want is a place to start
Oh, oh
I don't want to know the end, all I want is a place to start
Oh, oh

[Outro]
Hey Mike, uh, just calling to uh, you know, send my condolences
Hey man, it's Mark, just calling to check in on you, see how you're doing
What up Mike? Just calling to see how you're doing, check in with you a little bit
Wanna obviously send my love and support and, um, just let you know I'm here for you
I know you're super busy, didn't wanna bother you, um, just wanted to let you know I'm thinking about you
Give me a call back if you want, if not, I get that too, um, but I'm sure I will see you and/or talk to you sometime soon. Alright bud, hope you're hanging in there. See ya
