Forfeit the game, before somebody else
Takes you out of the frame, puts your name to shame
Cover up your face, you can't run the race
The pace is too fast, you just won't last

Forfeit the game, before somebody else
Takes you out of the frame, puts your name to shame
Cover up your face, you can't run the race
The pace is too fast, you just won't last

Won't last

You love the way I look at you
While taking pleasure in the awful things you put me through
You take away if I give in
My life, my pride is broken

You like to think you're never wrong
(You live what you've learned)
You want to act like you're someone
(You live what you've learned)
You want someone to hurt like you
(You live what you've learned)
You want to share what you've been through
(You live what you've learned)

You love the things I say I'll do
The way I'll hurt myself again just to get back at you
You take away when I give in
My life, my pride is broken

You like to think you're never wrong
(You live what you've learned)
You want to act like you're someone
(You live what you've learned)
You want someone to hurt like you
(You live what you've learned)
You want to share what you've been through
(You live what you've learned)

Yo, yo
Forfeit the game, before somebody else
Takes you out of the frame, puts your name to shame
Cover up your face, you can't run the race
The pace is too fast, you just won't last
