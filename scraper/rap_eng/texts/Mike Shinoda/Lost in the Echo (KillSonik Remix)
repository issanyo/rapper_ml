And these promises broken
Deep below
Each word gets lost in the echo
So one last lie I can see through
This time I finally let you
Go, go, go

I finally let you go

This time I finally let you

Test my will, test my heart
Let me tell you how the odds gonna stack up
Y'all go hard, I go smart
How's that working out for y'all in the back, huh?
I've seen that frustration
Been crossed and lost and told "No"
And I've come back unshaken
Let down and lived and let go
So you can let it be known
I don't hold back, I hold my own
I can't be mapped, I can't be cloned
I can't C-flat, it ain't my tone
I can't fall back, I came too far
Hold myself up and love my scars
Let the bells ring wherever they are
'Cause I was there saying

And these promises broken
Deep below
Each word gets lost in the echo
So one last lie I can see through
This time I finally let you go
Go, go, go

Oh oh oh

This time I
This time I
This time I
This time I
This time I finally let you go

This time I finally let you
Go
(Go)

(Promises, promises)
And these promises broken
Deep below
Each word gets lost in the echo
So one last lie I can see through
This time I finally let you go
Go, go, go
