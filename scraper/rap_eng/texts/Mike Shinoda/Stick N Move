[Verse 1: Mike Shinoda]
This is how it's done, going for the title and crown
Renowned emcees surround as the beat breaks down
Into elements, bobbing of those the Buddha blessed
Finesse the M-I-C the way it ought to be finessed, yes

Yes, am I the one to keep you on your toes?
Most definitely in my B-boy pose!
It's the Electric Boogaloo with a slight twist
Touch your chin to your chest to the rhythm like this:

[Chorus: Mark Wakefield]
Now I see what I have, I want you
Be with me, or stick and move
Now I see what I had, I want you
Be with me, or stick and move

[Verse 2: Mike Shinoda]
Emcees dogging me since the first day I grabbed the mic
Now it's like Sit! Stay!
Cobra Kai flystyles I'm kicking
Sticking emcees real quick 'cause times ticking

At the drop of a tenpence, I let loose the venom
Sending a shot of verbal heat up in them
The ending is done, grab your family and run
Apocalyptic rhyme pattern taking shots at the sun

Record industry rule four-thousand-eighty-one:
Question my intentions and your whole world is done
Like Forrest, you'll run, turn your eyeballs into Saturn
Full Metal Jacket, fully auto-rhyme pattern

[Chorus: Mark Wakefield]
Now I see what I have, I want you
Be with me, or stick and move
Now I see what I had, I want you
Be with me, or stick and move

[Bridge: Mike Shinoda]
Sticking, rock your whole clique and I'm wicked
Moving, booming of our tunes and you're grooving
Sticking, rock your whole clique and I'm wicked
Moving, booming of our tunes and you're grooving

Sticking, rock your whole clique and I'm wicked
Moving, booming of our tunes and you're grooving
Sticking, rock your whole clique and I'm wicked
Moving, booming of our tunes and you're grooving

[Chorus: Mark Wakefield]
Now I see what I have, I want you
Be with me or stick and move
Now I see what I had, I want you
Be with me or stick and move
