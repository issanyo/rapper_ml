[Verse 1]
Yeah
Welcome, yeah it's been a long minute
Let me break it down now, if y'all still with it
First time I did it, yeah I'll admit it
I kinda hit it and quit it and left y'all hanging
Sang it kinda off key with a passion
Asking, can I give you back that action?
Yeah, I'ma blast in a hashtag fashion
To spell it out for you like a mass closed caption
Get a closed casket, fade to black
This is my spot that I'm taking back
Get at me punk, I was made for that
Y'all don't really even know what you aiming at
So far back, what you waving at?
Ya'll can't see the stage that I'm playing at
Ya'll hating that, but that's why I do it
So tell me where the motherfucking haters at?

[Chorus]
'Cause I don't need their blessing, now
I don't need their invitation
Ain't no way to shut me down
Or to take this path I've taken
And maybe I've been left out
Never let this be mistaken
They can keep that blessing now, forget me now
'Cause I was never welcome

[Verse 2]
Yeah, it's been a long road
Never really know how it all unfold
I'm just trying hard not to sell my soul
When the rest want guns and a mouth full of gold
I don't hate 'em, I still love 'em
That's not me, I'm not judging
Not below 'em, not above 'em
But disrespect me? Well, then fuck 'em
This a house I'm living in
Ya'll just pass through, visiting
I draw these lines, ya'll fill 'em in
I'm a grown ass man, y'all children
No competition, I'm killing them
Talking 'bout him and him and him
Let's take it out for another spin again
And I don't give a fuck if I win again

[Chorus]
'Cause I don't need their blessing, now
I don't need their invitation
Ain't no way to shut me down
Or to take this path I've taken
And maybe I've been left out
Never let this be mistaken
They can keep that blessing now, forget me now
'Cause I was never welcome

[Bridge]
No (I was never welcome)
No, no (I was never welcome)
No, no, no
No, no (I was never welcome)
No, no

[Chorus]
I don't need their blessing, now
I don't need their invitation
Ain't no way to shut me down
Or to take this path I've taken
And maybe I've been left out
Never let this be mistaken
They can keep that blessing now, forget me now
'Cause I was never welcome

[Outro]
I was never welcome (No)
I was never welcome (No, no)
I was never welcome
I was never welcome
