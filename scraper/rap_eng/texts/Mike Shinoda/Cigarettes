[Intro]
Yeah, go ahead and, uh, cue the special effects

[Verse 1]
Man, I love this rap game, mainly 'cause it's cool
To add a little spice to the life you've been through
Everyone exaggerates a tiny little bit
Make that shit sound more gangsta than it really is

You can't appear weak, man, we wanna hear street
We wanna hear you spit your thug over this here beat
Don't take it as sarcastic, I can't get enough
I'm telling you, you can call my bluff, if it's not rough

Then, I really don't need it, I'm not even ashamed
I got too much reality that's filling up my brain
So sell me on that product, I'm addicted to the game
Suck it up like a cigarette, light it up, man

[Chorus]
It's just like a cigarette, it's something that I do
Once in a while, but between me and you
It's just like a cigarette, nobody's really fooled
I don't want the truth, I wanna feel fucking cool

[Verse 2]
Let me tell you something that I realized tonight
My hip-hop radio's like Marlboro light
They both selling stories and they sound about the same
Cigarettes say they safe, rappers claim they really bang

We don't care if it's true when we just lay the money down
We don't believe the words, we just love the way they sound
They're acting like we're idiots, they're lying to our face
Maybe we are idiots, we buy it anyway

I'm running out to get the next rapper's CD
Just sucking up the guns, drugs, and misogyny
The same way that I suck up all the stories when I breathe
That little bit of death, supposedly cancer free

And everything they say's got the truth twisted up
And twisted up's what I want, man, I can't get enough
'Cause even though we know it's all just a big bluff
We just light another up, what, we don't give a fuck!

[Chorus]
It's just like a cigarette, it's something that I do
Once in a while, but between me and you
It's just like a cigarette, nobody's really fooled
I don't want the truth, I wanna feel fucking cool

It's just like a cigarette, it's something that I do
Over and over, but between me and you
It's just like a cigarette, nobody's really fooled
I don't want the truth, I wanna feel fucking cool

[Bridge]
Man, listen to my words, listen for a while
Lip service radio, don't touch the dial
If you're in the car, turn up the track, man
Give your whole neighborhood some second hand rap

Hey, a matter of fact, listen for a while
Lip service radio, don't touch the dial
If your in the car, man, turn up the track
And give the whole neighborhood some second hand rap

[Chorus]
It's just like a cigarette, it's something that I do
Once in a while, but between me and you
It's just like a cigarette, nobody's really fooled
I don't want the truth, I wanna feel fucking cool

It's just like a cigarette, it's something that I do
Over and over, but between me and you
It's just like a cigarette, nobody's really fooled
I don't want the truth, I wanna feel fucking cool
