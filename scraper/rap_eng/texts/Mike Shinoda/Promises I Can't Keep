[Verse 1]
What's the difference between a man and a monster
Is it somewhere between "I can" and "I want to"
Is it somewhere between the promises I made
And the fact I couldn't see something getting in the way

[Pre-Chorus]
I used to think that I know what I want
Never saw it coming unglued
I used to think that I know what I want
Now it's time to see if it's true

[Chorus]
I had so much certainty
Till that moment I lost control
And I've tried but it never was up to me
I've got no worse enemy
Than the fear of what's still unknown
And the time's come to realize there will be
Promises I can't keep

[Verse 2]
What's the difference between a loss and a forfeit
I tried to make it better, but I made it more sick
I tried to make it right, but now awake at night
I know reality was getting in the way

[Pre-Chorus]
I used to think that I knew who I was
Never saw it coming unglued
I used to think that I knew who I was
Now it's time to see if it's true

[Chorus]
I had so much certainty
Till that moment I lost control
And I've tried but it never was up to me
I've got no worse enemy
Than the fear of what's still unknown
And the time's come to realize there will be
Promises I can't keep

[Chorus]
I had so much certainty
Till that moment I lost control
And I've tried but it never was up to me
I've got no worse enemy
Than the fear of what's still unknown
And the time's come to realize there will be
Promises I can't keep
Promises I can't keep
