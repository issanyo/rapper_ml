[Verse 1]
In the dark days, I'll part ways with the blame
Trying to maintain, but it's still all the same
It's all a game, hear my name in the rain
And the pain I wear on my face with a tear stain

You feign fondness
Honestly, it's time to give you a piece of my mind
And show you that you're blind
And in the design of the world I call mine
Know that you can't stand on both sides of the line

[Pre-Chorus]
Everything is my fault
(It's all the same, just pass me the blame)
The problems have two faces

Everything is my fault
(It's all the same, just pass me the blame)
The problems have two faces

[Chorus]
Pass all the blame over to me
It will come, eventually
Take the time out to examine
All these questions, honestly

[Verse 2]
With my eyes shut, I'm seeing the truth in your words
The absurd slurred into beauty to be heard
You swim through deceit, the lies that you tell
The stories you sell, knowing you well, I keep distance

And every instance, you keep your thoughts concealed
What I feel, just another spoke in the wheel
All or nothing, thrown down and trampled by your heel
And eaten away by my own version of the real

[Pre-Chorus]
Everything is my fault
(It's all the same, just pass me the blame)
The problems have two faces

Everything is my fault
(It's all the same, just pass me the blame)
The problems have two faces

[Chorus]
Pass all the blame over to me
It will come, eventually
Take the time out to examine
All these questions, honestly

[Outro]
(Who's to blame?)

Nothing thrown down (It's all the same, just pass me the blame)
Trampled by your heel (Play the game and win a tear stain)
Eaten by my own (Pass the pain, 'cause you'll feel it if you don't)
Version of the real (I'll stop counting 'til you've got your own)

Nothing thrown down (It's all the same, just pass me the blame)
Trampled by your heel (Play the game and win a tear stain)
Eaten by my own (Pass the pain, 'cause you'll feel it if you don't)
Version of the real (I'll stop counting 'til you've got your own)
