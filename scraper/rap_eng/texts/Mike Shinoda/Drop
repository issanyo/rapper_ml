Hi
We're back
Kenji, Artofficial
Rapology 13

Why do these people have to get in my way?
I'm losing more and more pity for idiots every day
Say what you want about my outlook, I'm pessimistic
But you're the one who watches Jerry Springer's guests with their shit schtick
Just the other day, I saw my neighbor on the show
Cause her crack-smoking kids were fucking a dog when she came home from work
And it was her bestiality videotapes and crack rock that gave them all the ideas in the first place
Not even worst case scenario, it's everywhere I turn
Rap records still coming out talking about how they got money to burn
And Joe can't get his turntables fixed
And this hunchback repair man with a hairlip is a fucking lunatic
When all we gotta do is fix the AC cord that blew out
And this dude's charging us seventy-two bucks to take the screws out (that's ridiculous)
I'm fed up and I'm doing all I can do to move to a deserted island
And make my own shit out of coconuts and bamboo

The world's nothing but a can full of idiots
The world's nothing but a basket full of stupids
The world's nothing but a bucket full of morons
I don't wanna talk to you so don't look at me
The world's nothing but a can full of idiots
The world's nothing but a basket full of stupids
The world's nothing but a bucket full of morons
I don't wanna talk to you so don't look at me

Now I'm starting to think that Kaczynski fella had a good point
My grandpa's popping Valium and Viagra, smoking joints
Cause the doctor said it would cure his anxiety attacks
But the reason he's so anxious is he's doing all that smack
And my cousin Pete the phone sex freak went to Vegas with one of the operators
And she drove off in his Mercedes
And he went around town alone and he gambled all his cheddar
Now he and Grandpa sit at home and shoot heroin together
But that's what happens in a world of hedonists and heretics
Teachers get paid less than cops and psychotherapists
Cause it's pretty damn important to give you a ticket for a headlight
So you can get home safe and visit Charles Manson's website
Or see the shrink to get your head right
Or get on the road and get hit by a slobbering drunk driver running a red light
Or get murdered by Mr. Green in the alley with a lead pipe
Or sing the chorus because it's alright

The world's nothing but a can full of idiots
The world's nothing but a basket full of stupids
The world's nothing but a bucket full of morons
I don't wanna talk to you so don't look at me
The world's nothing but a can full of idiots
The world's nothing but a basket full of stupids
The world's nothing but a bucket full of morons
I don't wanna talk to you so don't look at me

(Hey boy, what you sayin'?)
