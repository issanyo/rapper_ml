[Verse 1: Mike Shinoda]
I had a friend named Victor
The two of us used to hang every single day
And it seemed like overnight that his whole life just changed
I know when his mom and dad broke up, it didn't make sense
But I know that his dad was a drunk and he gambled away the rent

Pretty soon, Vic was seeing red, pissed off, but instead
He'd drink every night 'til he passed out, then he'd do it all again
The whole time, smiling on the outside to cover the pain
But on the inside, all he was trying to do was get away

[Chorus: Jonah & Kenna]
He's dying to get away
Let the pain of yesterday go
Slipping through the cracks

[Verse 2: Tak]
Yo, funny how things change color
Then fade to another shade
When you had it made
It was all good, but now look, just another day

It was so fresh, it was so clean
Now it's all gone, one, two, three, lights out
Which way to turn, can't get a grip
All alone in a big white house

Every day gets worse
And you just curse 'til your head bursts
And it hurts so bad, she left, now you suffer
Should've thought of that one first

No family, no kids, can't accept what you did
Now you wanna run away but you can't
'Cause the past comes back again

[Verse 3: Ryu]
Slipping through the cracks, sip a little Jack
Go to bed half dead, what about rent?
Why does every cent gotta be a bet?
When's it gonna end?

Oh my god, we don't got a penny left
My mom's gotta find a way to get a job
Out of debt, out of dodge
Out of breath, out of this big problem

My pops wanna get away from the pain
In a better place in his brain
But the medication he takes makes him wasted
So sick, if he's gonna think
That the good lord would come take him
I'm shaking him, "Wake up, you son of a bitch!"

[Chorus: Jonah & Kenna]
He's dying to get away
Let the pain of yesterday go slipping through the cracks
Hiding himself away
Watching all the memories fade away from red to black

He's dying to get away
Let the pain of yesterday go slipping through the cracks
Hiding himself away
Watching all the memories fade away from red to black

[Outro]
Slipping through the cracks
Slipping through the cracks
Slipping through the cracks
