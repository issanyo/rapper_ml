Don't worry about the time
Just watch the sun set
I keep my feelings bottled up
Things that I've regret

Oh can it be
Up to me right now

Everything's so lovely
In the sky right now
I want to take it back
But I don't know how
Can you chase the rainbow
To find its end
Take me to your Ground Xero
Back again

I simply wish that I
Could feel the way you do
I just outta again
Standin' next to you

Gone overboard
And restore my pain

Everything's so lovely
In the sky right now
I want to take it back
But I don't know how
Can you chase the rainbow
To find its end
Take me to your Ground Xero
Back again
