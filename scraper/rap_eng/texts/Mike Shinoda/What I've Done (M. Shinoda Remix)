[Verse 1]
In this farewell
There's no blood, there's no alibi
'Cause I've drawn regret
From the truth of a thousand lies

[Pre-Chorus]
So, let mercy come
And wash away what I've done

[Chorus]
I'll face myself
To cross out what I've become
Erase myself
And let go of what I've done

[Verse 2]
Put to rest
What you thought of me
While I clean this slate
With the hands of uncertainty

[Pre-Chorus]
So, let mercy come
And wash away what I've done

[Chorus]
I'll face myself
To cross out what I've become
Erase myself
And let go of what I've done

[Bridge]
For what I've done, I'll start again
And whatever pain may come
Today, this ends
And forgiving what I've done

[Chorus]
I'll face myself
To cross out what I've become
Erase myself
And let go of what I've done

[Outro]
(Na na na, na na na, na na na, na na na)
What I've done
(Na na na, na na na, na na na, na na na)
Forgiving what I've done
(Na na na, na na na, na na na, na na na)
