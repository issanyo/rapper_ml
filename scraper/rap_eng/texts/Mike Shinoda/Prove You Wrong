[Chorus]
Welcome to the breakdown
Tired of playing games now
Make it no mistake
I will prove you wrong
I'm sick of being patient
Underestimated
This will be the day
That I prove you wrong

[Verse 1]
Walkin' in the building
Everybody still askin' how I'm feeling
Have I felt like I finally caught a rhythm
Now I know what kind of answer I should give them
But I say I'm just trying know where the next step is
Looking for the "go" where the "ready, set" is
Tryna find a beat I can get in step with
I'm just tryna breathe, let me get a breath in
Yes I know, we all can't follow where I plan to go
All I want is faith in the path I chose
All I want is faith in the path I chose

[Chorus]
Welcome to the breakdown
Tired of playing games now
Make it no mistake
I will prove you wrong
I'm sick of being patient
Underestimated
This will be the day
That I prove you wrong

[Verse 2]
I was on a high for a minute
Feeling just right, just fine for a minute
And then my vibe could turn on its side in a minute
The second I asked you if you had my back
And in your hesitation, betrayed, you did not
I asked you for confidence you haven't got
Heartbreakin', you basically end and you find
There was no way to take it but anger inspired
So there you go
All I want is faith in the path I chose
All I'm getting back is an "I don't know"
Standing in the flames as the fire grows

[Chorus]
Welcome to the breakdown
Tired of playing games now
Make it no mistake
I will prove you wrong
I'm sick of being patient
Underestimated
This will be the day
That I prove you...

[Bridge]
I've been to the bottom now
And I may go back again
Even if I could turn back time
There are things out of our hands
I've been to the bottom now
And I may go back again
Even if I could turn back time
There are things out of our hands
I've been to the bottom now
And I may go back again
Even if I could turn back time
There are things out of our hands
I've been to the bottom now
And I may go back again
Even if I could turn back time
There are things out of our hands

[Chorus]
So welcome to the breakdown
Tired of playing games now
Make it no mistake
I will prove you wrong
I'm sick of being patient
Underestimated
This will be the day
That I prove you wrong
Welcome to the breakdown
Make it no mistake
I will prove you wrong
Welcome to the breakdown
This will be the day
That I prove you wrong
