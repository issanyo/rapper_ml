Water gray
Through the windows, up the stairs
Chilling rain
Like an ocean everywhere
Don't want to reach for me, do you?
I mean nothing to you
The little things give you away
And now there will be no mistaking
The levees are breaking
All you've ever wanted
Was someone to truly look up to you
And six feet under water, I do
Hope decays
Generations disappear
Washed away
As a nation simply stares
Don't want to reach for me, do you?
I mean nothing to you
The little things give you away
But now there will be no mistaking
The levees are breaking
All you've ever wanted
Was someone to truly look up to you
And six feet under water, I do
All you've ever wanted
Was someone to truly look up to you
And six feet underground, now I, now I do
The little things give you away
The little things give you away
The little things give you away
The little things give you away
The little things give you away
(All you've ever wanted)
(Was someone to truly look up to you)
The little things give you away
The little things give you away
(All you've ever wanted)
(Was someone to truly look up to you)
The little things give you away
The little things give you away
(All you've ever wanted)
(Was someone to truly look up to you)
The little things give you away
The little things give you away
(All you've ever wanted)
(Was someone to truly look up to you)
The little things give you away
The little things give you away
(All you've ever wanted)
(Was someone to truly look up to you)
The little things give you away
The little things give you away
(All you've ever wanted)
(Was someone to truly look up to you)
The little things give you away
