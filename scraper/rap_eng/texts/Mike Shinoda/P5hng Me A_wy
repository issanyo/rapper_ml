[Intro: Stephen Richards & Mike Shinoda (Reversed)]
When I look into your eyes
There's nothing there to see
Nothing but my own mistakes
Staring back at me

Everything falls apart even
Even the people who never frown eventually break down
Everything has to end
You’ll soon find we’re out of time left to watch it all unwind

Everything falls apart even
Even the people who never frown eventually break down
Everything has to end
You’ll soon find we’re out of time left to watch it all unwind

[Verse 1: Chester Bennington]
I've lied to you, this is the last smile
That I’ll fake for the sake of being with you

[Pre-Chorus: Mike & Chester]
Everything falls apart
Even the people who never frown eventually break down
Everything has to end
You'll soon find we're out of time left to watch it all unwind

For the sake of being with you
Everything falls apart
Even the people who never frown eventually break down
The sacrifice is never knowing

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
Why I stay
When you just push away
No matter what you see
You're still so blind to me

[Verse 2: Chester]
I've tried, like you
To do everything you wanted to
This is the last time
I'll take the blame for the sake of being with you

[Pre-Chorus: Mike & Chester]
Everything falls apart
Even the people who never frown eventually break down
The sacrifice of hiding in a lie
Everything has to end
You'll soon find we're out of time left to watch it all unwind
The sacrifice is never knowing

[Chorus: Chester]
Why I stay
When you just push away
No matter what you see
You’re still so blind to me

[Bridge: Stephen & Chester]
Reverse psychology is failing miserably
It's so hard to be left all alone
Telling you is the only chance for me
There's nothing left but to turn and face you

When I look into your eyes
There's nothing there to see
Nothing but my own mistakes
Staring back at me, asking why

[Pre-Chorus: Chester & Stephen]
The sacrifice of hiding in a lie
The sacrifice is never knowing

[Chorus: Chester]
Why I stay
When you just push away
No matter what you see
You’re still so blind to me

Why I stay
When you just push away
No matter what you see
You’re still so blind to me
