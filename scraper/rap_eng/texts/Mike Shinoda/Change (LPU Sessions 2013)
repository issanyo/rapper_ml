[Verse 1]
Here, I wait for a good thing to resolve
When I'm sinking in a ship I can't control
And I'm sick with a smile I try and hide
Broken pieces of a lie I can't let go

[Pre-Chorus]
I never meant to let you down, again
I had it all, but watched it drown

[Chorus]
Why does every good thing have to end?
I've burned every bridge before it began
(And now, I'm sinking)
I changed, a man I thought I'd never be
I've burned every bridge before it began
I swear, I'm gonna change

[Verse 2]
Here, I wait, swimming in a sea of dark
I'm lost in the current of my faults
Here, I sink, holding on with all I had
The tide will rise, I'm gonna own what's mine

[Pre-Chorus]
I never meant to let you down, again
I had it all, but watched it drown

[Chorus]
Why does every good thing have to end?
I've burned every bridge before it began
(And now, I'm sinking)
I changed, a man I thought I'd never be
I've burned every bridge before it began
I swear, I'm gonna change

[Bridge]
All I wanna do is break free
All I wanna do is break free

[Pre-Chorus]
I never meant to let you down, again
I had it all, but watched it drown

[Chorus]
Why does every good thing have to end?
I've burned every bridge before it began
(And now, I'm sinking)
I changed, a man I thought I'd never be
I've burned every bridge before it began
I swear, I'm gonna change

[Outro]
I swear, I'm gonna change
All I wanna do is break free
All I wanna do is break free
I swear, I'm gonna change
