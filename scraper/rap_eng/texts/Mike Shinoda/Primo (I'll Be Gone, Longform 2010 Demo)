[Verse 1: Mike and Chester]
Like shining oil this night is dripping down
Night is dripping down
Glistening
And I’m trying not to think what I’m leaving now
Cause I'm leaving now
It’s time you let me go
Let me go

[Chorus: Chester]
'Till then carry on
And miss me when I'm gone
Oh don't let anyone give you away
Just carry on
And miss me when I'm gone
Oh don't let anyone take my place
Take my place

[Verse 2: Mike & chester]
This tear between us is getting thinner now
Getting thinner now
Bittersweet
And ‘cross that horizon this sun is setting now
Slowly setting now
It’s time to let me go
Let me go

[Chorus: Chester]
'Till then carry on
And miss me when I'm gone
Oh don't let anyone give you away
Just carry on
And miss me when I'm gone
Oh don't let anyone take my place
Take my place

[Guitar solo]

[Chorus, variation]
Just carry on
And miss me when I'm gone
Oh don't let anyone give you away
Just carry on
And miss me when I'm gone
Oh don't let anyone take my place
Take my place

[Bridge]
Tell them I couldn’t help myself
And tell them I was alone
Tell them I was the only one
And there’s nothing that can stop me from going home

Tell them I couldn’t help myself
And tell them I was alone
Oh tell them I was the only one
And there’s nothing that can stop me
From going home!

Oh tell them I was the only one
And there’s nothing that can stop me
From going home!
