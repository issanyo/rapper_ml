[Verse: Mike Shinoda]
Listen, my blood feels like it's sitting still in my veins
My motivation was gone before it even came
Today and yesterday, they both seem the same
And no matter how I try, I just can't change

Give me one reason I should go outside
Everything'll be the same no matter what I try
Some people'll live and some people'll die
Some people'll build their whole life on a lie

I used to blame you for the things that I thought you'd say
So now, I can't blame you for going away
'Cause these memories are the blood beating under my skin
Repeating the same thoughts again and again

[Chorus: Mike Shinoda]
Again and again
You said we couldn't last long enough
Or be strong enough
Again and again
You said our voices weren't loud enough
But we've had enough because

We want our future back
We want our own mistakes
To take our own path
We wanna do it again

[Instrumental Verse]

[Chorus: Mike Shinoda]
Again and again
You said we couldn't last long enough
Or be strong enough
Again and again
You said our voices weren't loud enough
But we've had enough because

We want our future back
We want our own mistakes
To take our own path
We wanna do it again

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Chorus: Mike Shinoda]
Again and again
You said we couldn't last long enough
Or be strong enough
Again and again
You said our voices weren't loud enough
But we've had enough because

We want our future back
We want our own mistakes
To take our own path
We wanna do it again and again

You said we couldn't last long enough
Or be strong enough
Again and again
You said our voices weren't loud enough
But we've had enough because

We want our future back
We want our own mistakes
To take our own path
We wanna do it again
