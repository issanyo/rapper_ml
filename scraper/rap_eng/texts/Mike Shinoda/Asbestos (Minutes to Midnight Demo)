[Verse 1: Mike Shinoda]
Don't start with the ugly part
Don't end with the things that'll make them want to walk away
Tune in at the din again, another price ain't cheap
But somebody's gonna have to pay

Oh yes, you can only guess what it is, what it was
Don't remember what I had in mind
Shotgunning on a joy ride, coming down the block
Half-cocked nearly half the time

Give it back, give it back
Give it back, g-g-give it back, sing it

[Verse 2: Mike Shinoda]
One time for the words divine
And two times for the things that you hope you never have to say
Three scenes in a dead man's dream, and the girls tell the boys
That they better fucking run away

Live it up or g-g-give it up, turn it up, tune it out
Let it rhyme with the other line
Shotgunning on a joy ride, coming down the block
Half-cocked nearly all the time

Give it back, give it back
Give it back, g-g-give it back, sing it
