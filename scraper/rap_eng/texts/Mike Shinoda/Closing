Rapology Twelve
Disc of Lee Cadena
The whole Urban Network family
And your fatass mama
Kenji and DJ Artofficial representing Xero
Cash double oh
Styles Of Beyond
Junkyard Scientific
Rhetoric
Ashkon
And Usher

Let's give a hand for my man
Now it's my turn to spit shit
These syllabolic ballistics spending rhythmic existence
It's twisted
That when my pens passively takes this down
Systematically smashing and hammering one category of sound
Into the next
Can you and I see in a defensive fashion
Attacking emcees and back and neck muscle contraction whiplashes
It's synchronization with the tempo created when rhythms meet
This musical fitness workout, rhyme and beat moving your feet
Packing trash bags with action making every fraction of a sentence hectic
With the IMAX armed division letterbox widescreen perspective
Lee Cadena's Urban Network Rapology Twelve collective
Kenji and Artofficial and Xero keeping you pop progressive
