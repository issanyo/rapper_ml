[Intro]
Bismillah

[Verse 1]
It goes like
They were staring at the stars
Count on this, you could never count them all
It goes like
Sky on fire, waves and moon
Everything you think you're watching watching you

[Hook]
It goes like this
It go like this
It goes
Goin', goin', goin'
It goes like
It go like this
It goes
Goin', goin', goin', goin'
It goes like

[Verse 2]
They were staring at the stars
How it's bright while it's dark?
Ain't that odd? Perfect art
It goes like
How it's light then it's dark?
Then that dark fall apart
Perfect star, perfect art
It goes like this
It go like this
It goes
Inspiration, information
Revelation, confirmation
It goes like this
It go like this
It goes
The poverty and the wealth of nations
The entire cosmic situation
Is far greater
You won't escape it
Goin', goin', goin'
You won't escape it

[Hook]
It goes like this
It go like this
It goes
Goin', goin', goin'
It goes like

[Verse 2]
They were staring at the stars
How it's bright while it's dark?
Ain't that odd? Perfect art
It goes like
How it's light then it's dark?
Then that dark fall apart
Perfect star, perfect art
It goes like
It go like this
It goes
Inspiration, information
Revelation, confirmation
It goes like this
It go like this
It goes
The entire cosmic situation
Is far greater than the poverty and the wealth of nations
