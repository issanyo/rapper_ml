And here we go...

[Rap: Mos Def]
Yo, is it me?
Did you really tryna see
Or some fantasy of mine
Name on the marquee
Sometimes I really cannot ID
'Cause you be on some sex and sugar
Shhh-shhh-shhh-shhh shut your mouth
(I'm just talkin' bout Shaft)
I'm at the dance doin' my thing, right? Right
She was at the dance with her crew
"Flashlight!"
The eye contact, powerful impact amaze
"Cause he starin' at you!"
Beats knocking, peep shorty locked in my gaze
"Yeah, she know me."
Trying to keep it low key
"Who you wit, B?"
I'm in here all by my lonely
Yo, slowly in dream time
Queen make the bee-line
Traded mathematicals
Energy was magical
I'm after you like Monday after weekend
"You're deep in!"
Tweaking, now you start speaking
"Let's be friends"
First it's stop, then it's go, now it's dead
Yellow, green, to red
"She's effing with your head"
Check the messages
"Hey you, it's me
You ain't checking for me like
The way you used to be"
Now I'm at the rest
Wondering what goes on
'Cause you be tuning up my strings
But never play my song
And that's wrong baby, and that's wrong baby

[Verse 1:]
Every time you search around
Boy, you miss my loving
(Work it out now, what?
Work it out now, yeah
Let 'em know)
Every time the sun goes down
You reach for your good thing
(Freak it out now, what?
Freak it out now, yeah
Blow it out now, what?
Let 'em know, and then...)
Baby, why you wanna deny?
Why do you confuse this?
(Now honey love, you got my whole head
You put your mind thinking the code red)
Don't you let our love pass you by
'Cause you may just lose it
(I'm bout to blast on the next thing smoking
You better wake up, stop all your joking 'cause)

[Chorus:]
Love me
Boy, why are you bull-shhh?
(Sh-mon, sh-mon, sh-mon)
Love me
Boy, why are you bull-shhh?
(Sh-mon, sh-mon, sh-mon)

[Verse 2:]
Sit down and look in my eyes
Feel my heart and hold me
(Heartbeat, you make me feel so weak)
And what I got will really surprise you
Feel my body, don't wait
(Alright, okay, alright, okay okay
Alright, okay, I'm feeling you)
Baby, come and love me tonight
How could you refuse this?
(I'm hot to death, you better show respect
I'm hot to death, you better show respect, for real)
Don't you let this passion pass you by
Or you may just lose it
(I'm about to ease with the breeze, believe
I'm about to ease with the breeze, baby, check it)

[Chorus](2x)

Check out my melody
Check out my melody
Check out my melody

I get down for mine (that's right)
You get down for yours (say word)
I get down for mine (that's right)
Now baby, get down for yours (say word)

I'mma go for mine (that's right)
Now baby come go for yours (say word)
I can throw for mine (that's right)
And tell me you'll throw for yours (say word)

See you, there you are
Searching around
When all the time
All you really need is me
See there you are
Wasting your time
When all the while
All you really need is me

Love me
Why you wasting?
Time is wasting
Love me

I throw down for mine (that's right)
Now can you throw down for yours? (say word)
I hold down for mine (that's right)
And tell me you're down for yours (say word)

I get bizz for mine (that's right)
Tell me you bizz for yours? (say word)
I'll hold down for mine (that's right)
And tell me you're down for yours (say word)
Tell me you're down for yours (say word)
Tell me you're down for yours (say word)
