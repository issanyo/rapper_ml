Everything
Is wrong since me
And my baby parted
All day long
I'm walkin'
Cause I couldn't
Get my car started
Laid off from job
And I can't afford
To check it
I wish somebody'd
Come along
And run in to it
And wreck it

Come on
Since my baby parted
Come on
I can't get started
Come on
I can't afford
To check it
I wish somebody'd
Come along
And run into it
And wreck it

Everything is wrong
Since I been without you
Every night I lay awake
Thinkin' about you
Every time the phone rings
Sounds like thunder
Some stupid jerk tryin'
To reach another number

Come on
Since I been without you
Come on
Steady thinkin' 'bout you
Come on
Phone sounds like thunder
Some stupid jerk
Tryin' to reach
Another number

Everything is wrong
Since I last saw you baby
I really want to see you
And I don't mean maybe
I'm doin' everything
Tryin' to make you see
That I belong
To you honey
And you belong to me

So come on
I wanna see you baby
Come on
I don't mean maybe
Come on
I'm tryin'
To make you see
That I belong to you
And you belong to me
Come on
