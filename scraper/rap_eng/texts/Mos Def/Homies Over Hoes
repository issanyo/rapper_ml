[Hook]
Homies over hoes, homies over hoes
Homies over hoes, homies over hoes
Do the homie! Do the homie!
Do the homie! Do the homie!

[Verse 1]
You never catch the 'lish, rollin with no bitch
Cause bitches ain't shit, you saw my crew is thick
Whole bunch of knuckleheads, the bald heads and dreads
Nigga, we hatin on them hoes like we hate the feds
Bitch, can't you see?! Fall back away from me
Me and my niggas bumpin CHEST in the VIP
Now bump it to the left, and bump it to the right
Cause when you do the homie, nigga got to do it right

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Uh..
Cause bitches be trouble, be havin niggas beefin
You trickin on that ho, and yo' niggas ain't eatin
She pushin yo' whip, spendin all yo' cash
Yo' homie got shot up, while you was in dat ass -- BEEITCH!!

[Hook]
