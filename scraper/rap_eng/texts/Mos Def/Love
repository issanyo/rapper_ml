[Verse 1]
Love is feeling that clever people try'na avoid
But if love happens you'll already have any choice
You can love your sis', of course your mother
Maybe you and your girl do love each other
Already 2 years. So much time has gone
Am I the one who's brought here to be left alone?
Is it really that serious? Maybe I can deal with it?
Tried to make this world a better place, but in the end
All i saw was their backs, did I supposed to stand?
Actually nah', glory to my support
You gave me money and you gave me the love
What is love? Tell me that! I really thought that i felt it
Is it true you got flies getting fun in your belly?
Am I young for this shit? Am I different a bit?
I got influenced by pop culure so I'm thirsty to hit
4 simple letters and just one syllable

[Hook]
Love, l-o-v-e and I be
Love, l-o-v-e to emcee
Get love, l-o-v-e
Love, l-o-v-e, I emcee
Get love, l-o-v-e and I be
Love, l-o-v-e to emcee
Love

[Verse 2]
I remember her eyes and the freckles on cheeks
I remeber me sweating when she starting to speak
What the fuck is this, will somebody try to explain?
Shut up - he says- that's the love has come to your veins
Mary Jane i'm your Parker i'll take you to the top
Of this world, but at first I need find out how to talk
To these freaking women. Who the fuck has invented 'em?
Sometimes I think that they are just computer programms
Oh, girl, what the difference beetween love and the sex drive?
Love is key to keep the partner close to family survive
Nothing more and nothing less
It is natural process, yeah
You listen to me, you think I look for justification
Hell yeah, not now, I need time for recreation
But time is coming out. What if I never get my first kiss?
What if i'll never feel the taste of bliss of

[Hook]
Love, l-o-v-e and I be
Love, l-o-v-e to emcee
Get love, l-o-v-e and I be
Love, l-o-v-e, I emcee
Get love, l-o-v-e and I be
Love, l-o-v-e to emcee
Get love, l-o-v-e and I be
Love, l-o-v-e to emcee

[Verse 3]
I start to think, and then I sink
Into the paper, like I was ink
When I'm writing, I'm trapped in between the lines
I escape, when I finish the rhyme
It ain't my words but I got so much respect
A lot of people forget 'em so I did ressurect
The mighty Mos Def got love for ya'll
So don't call him anymore, you better call Saul
You better start to think
You better start to think
You got faded of the love, don't forget to live
Phragrance gon' leave the room and you'll get she's a thief
Look around, your friends ain't yet fucked you up
So please make a favor
Show 'em your real love

[Hook]

Get love, l-o-v-e and I be
Love, l-o-v-e, I emcee
Get love, l-o-v-e and I be
Love, l-o-v-e to emcee
Get love, l-o-v-e and I be
Love, l-o-v-e to emcee
