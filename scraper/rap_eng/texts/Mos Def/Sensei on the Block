[Verse 1: Yasiin Bey]
Them dude's too ugly to be the champ
In a language we can clearly understand
Shabazz
Bey is the man
With or without a single fan
High ground circus still stay feet stand not a chance
Heavens advanced so we advance with the advancement
Enhance with no robotic enhancement, flow handsome
Huddle the kindred fore the fire, plugged the pig pen
Thick skin, rich color hard body fresh butter
Rougher than leather from era lighter and thunder
Warm winters and cold summers, King Michael and Obama
Funky drummers, daughters and son sonners
Elders and youngers to measurement beyond numbers
And came to break the gate like Saint Tubman and not for nothing
In this tradition, my beloved will not asunder
And keep it hundred
Illies  Billies and googlians
The Christ crack the sky in Jerusalem
Make the devil stop all the foolishness and rude unruliness
Cooney coonage and gooney goofiness
Hallelujah jumpin jehosafats, my momma ain't sane
Bucktown black and proud you can say what you say
Somethin' famous, who the greatest? Bey all day
Blind eyes and liar liars do not make it fade
Cool frames don't qualify sun block
Coolest shades ain't never made the sun stop
Some hot, some not
Some never chase the sun spot
Black like gorgeous
Divine, it's why the shine is on him
Good morning, wake up
Nevermind the make up, paper
It's time to get right with the creator

[Hook]
Chop Chop Sensei
Chop Chop you're the best
Chop Chop you're the best around
It's all over town, center edge getting down
Hear it out: You're the best around
Chop Chop Sensei on the block
Chop Chop, let it knock
Listen
