[Fela Kuti speaking]
One thing I want to assure them
If they think I'm gonna change or compromise
My attitude and my way of life or
In my expression or in my goal
Towards politics
They are making me stronger
And I am much more stronger now..

[Mos Def]
Bang to the boogy
Say upchuck the boogy
To the rhythm of the boogity beat [x2]

There it go like simple the plainness, it's primal and basic
Zulu arrangement rockin' amazement
Flaco, radiating from heaven to pavement
They phony as a face lift, I’m nothing to play with

Spent time hating it but that ain't changing it
God give it to me no body ain't takin' it
Therefore, moving on the base for stimulus
Standing in the twilight and watching them get it in

Walls, tremblin', the air, simmering
She movin' like more than her ears are listenin', whoa now
Testin' your equilibrium
Sonic wave booming all over your intimate

Skin on skin and skin on skin again
Put it all, get it all, get on get it in
Ladies and gentlemen, misters and mistresses
Cousins, uncles, aunties, and synonyms, there it is, boogieman

Hah
Simmer down simmer down simmer down now
Simmer down now x3
Quiet dog, bite hard my god

Said and the rocket don't stop
Brooklyn in the kitchen heat up the stove top
Bey in the empire state and navigating the way
Preservation makes the greatest hip hop
The cool dudes swagger they terribly corny
The flow so petty,unsteady, it's boring
These dudes ain't dope but they on it
They need to get off it, so "wack wack" is all you can call it
Therefore, movin on to Def for stimulus
Regardless of what zone, what town you represent
A bullet into all your settlements
Tower to tenement
I mold through for all of the element
Simmer down
I manage your mayhem
I'm bright as the AM
Engine 'bout to roll out the station
I'm blessed with the fresh from day one
I got it from day done
We all going back to the same one
It's the cost of motivation I'll stay with
Remarkable flavors
That all bear the mark of the greatness

Woah now
Is to get us to buck town
Your girl is in love now
You chumps don’t want to get shut-down, Shoo

[Sirens]
Simmer down simmer down simmer down now
Simmer down now x3
Quiet dog, bite hard, let's rock

Hah
And we don't stop
See you rock to the rhythm we don't stop
So you maintain the rock and you don't stop
You keep up the rock and you don't stop
(The rock)
Maintain the rock and you don't stop
(The rock)
You keep up the rock and you don't stop
(The rock)
Maintain the rock and you don't stop
(The rock)
