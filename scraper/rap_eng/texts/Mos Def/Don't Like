[Verse 1]
White supremacy is what I don't like
Sucka ass crackas, what I don't like
The Bank of America, what I don't like
When they mention cynicism, I don't like
I don't like, I don't like
The way the ghetto living, I don't like
Got us trapped up in the system, I don't like
Ain't to different from a prison jacket, ain't right
Ain't no freedom in the trap, hustlers everywhere
You can feel it in the air, pure despair
Hungry hands only take when they reaching out
Campaign slogan, geek up, gun Pow
Ugly politicians, new election year
Con'd by their care, they are not sincere
Its the greedy and the rich ones that make war
That the hungry young and poor once payed for
Little homie stretched out in a coffin
They die younger and they dying more often
The rent to high, the wage too low
Top 5 stupid songs up on your radio

I don't like
All this cackling and caring on I don't like
All this suckerness and scared shit I don't like
All these African Americans it ain't right

And that goes for crazy ass crackers
Small claim court clowns and strip club rappers
Out in broad day with they nipples out
With they stretch marks, back hairs and pimples out (yuck)
You suck, go away
You always talking but and ya never got much to say (yuck)
You suck, go away
You always caught in space, fix your thirsty face

The way these jokers look and sound I don't like
The way I see them getting down, I don't like
Make me wonder how they get around it ain't right

In the land where crooks get the Riker laws
But people hide their eyes, and shut their jaws
Who the realest? never mind
Who the winner for the best arranged lies?
What they wearing? who is there?
Ask yourself, why you care?
Somebody going ham on a gossip cite
Catching feelings over rumors that are not your life
And I don't like, sometimes I even hate
But not the people, they ?? Race
I don't like, sometimes I even hate
Lord forgive us, let us pray!
For pussy posers, dummy creed
Polluted seeds, them wacky weaves
Nazi polites, waste of time
Cuz I ain't be recruitment, waste of time

I don't like, and you don't neither
We forgive and pray for these Fake niggas
