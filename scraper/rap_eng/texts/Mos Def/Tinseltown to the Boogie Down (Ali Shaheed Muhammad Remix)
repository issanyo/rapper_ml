Time keeps slippin'

[Verse One] [Lee Majors]
Yeah, the only thing Major don't waste is time in bed
My timin' is rare
Take time
Time to prepare
No time for fear
How many times I said it this year?
At what time y'all gonna realize that time is near?
Call a time out
Scritti Politti
Major climbed out
The cracks of the streets
Waste no time on beats
Mos Def
Most definitely
The rap chief
The new release, time to make cream
Time to take a piece
And at the same time
Time to rebuild
Time is realer
I swear I bring the Heat to tracks like Val Kilmer
You know that time waits for no man, in time you'll see
That you wastin' all you time while you watching TV
Aye yo it's 3D
I'm on it like walls to graffiti
From night sticks, to plungers, to NYPD
From Lucille to BB King, you've seen me rhyme
You stay away from drama if it's wasting your time

[Hook] [Lee Majors]
The time tables keep turning
(From Tinseltown)
You've got the both ends burning up, they burnin' up
And all the lies you been learnin'
(To the Boogiedown)
Won't holdin, won't hold
Time, time keeps slipping
Time tables keep turnin'
(From Cali fly)
You've got the both ends burning up, they burnin' up
And all the lies you been learnin'
(To the Do Or Die)
Keep your future on hold, on hold
Time keeps slippin'

[Verse Two] [Mos Def]
From Boogiedown to Tinseltown I had em' all gettin' down
My baggage claim's got exotic names, I get around
How I'm livin' now?
Well that's a whole lot different now
From where I'm sitting now
Got a whole clearer vision now
I played the tables hard, wild cards I was flipping down
My partners sittin' pounds, somewhere up in prison now
I'm flippin' high
Things switch and change so suddenly
You're where you're at today
When tomorrow is where you wanna be
You company
Shift when you start livin' comfortably
Spotlights switch and then you dip right from under me
Don't front for me
I want to be perfectly clear
The time is here, I'm keepin' yesterday in the rear
A current affair
Mos Def and Lee Majors appear
'Bout to rock this little ditty with the Scritti in here
And it's about that time, so if you could be then would you
Sit back and look at who time's been good to

[Hook] [Lee Majors]
The time tables keep turning
(From Tinseltown)
You've got the both ends burning up, they burnin' up
And all the lies you been learnin'
(To the Boogiedown)
Won't holdin, won't hold
Time, time keeps slipping
Time tables keep turnin'
(From Cali fly)
You've got the both ends burning up, they burnin' up
And all the lies you been learnin'
(To the Do Or Die)
Keep your future on hold, on hold
Time keeps slippin'

[Verse Three] [Lee Majors]
At one time I thought I had it all
Mass of broads
Flash awards, cash cards, time's a double-edged sword
One day you hear applause, next day when you leave
You catch a L in and it seems like Christopher Reeves
Do y'all believe that these cats threw dirt on my name?
Give 'em time, they couldn't win if I gave 'em point game
At times I used to swerve, now I'm learning my lane
Trapped in time, what a shame, with nobody to blame

[Mos Def]
It waits for no one
The fast and slow ones
The rich and no funds
The Samurais and Shoguns
The first stringer and no run
Ayo dunn
You better hop to it or you blow son
Cause time keeps slipping
Make no difference if you don't come
It's bein' well recorded how we sport it I advise we
Get on our game and do our thang and spend these moments wisely
It's time to make chase, give pace, no time to waste
First you on, then you gone so long, you been replaced

[Hook] [Lee Majors]
The time tables keep turning
(From Tinseltown)
You've got the both ends burning up, they burnin' up
And all the lies you been learnin'
(To the Boogiedown)
Won't holdin, won't hold
Time, time keeps slipping
Time tables keep turnin'
(From Cali fly)
You've got the both ends burning up, they burnin' up
And all the lies you been learnin'
(To the Do Or Die)
Keep your future on hold, on hold
Time keeps slippin'
