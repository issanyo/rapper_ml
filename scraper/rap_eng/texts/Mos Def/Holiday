[Verse 1: Mos Def]
Mark your calendar, holiday work week
May day: mothers day, Doomsday: another day
Teenage love built a teenage runaway
Bang, number 9 off the chart, pretty bullet
Red on the wall, fear God, fuck a bully
Bay ghetto great, great god, guggley muggley
Mays on monster mash, main course and cookies
Heads getting beaten over food gettin eaten
This is hydro power in the dry white season
Lord, bring em out, bring em out
See the cherokee chief rain dancing through a drought
Cloud break like Chaka Khan, set it off my power arm
The little light grow large and don't out at all
Some powerful all, the chronicle sharp
The jet black jedi swall, the saga evolves, raw
Race up in the place, all in your face
She said a slow pace, made her heart race
Well if you got what it takes, I take what you got
My equaline a mark from I'm a take the shot
The tiebreaker, game winner, bullseye
Small dose of big Mos, full time
That's a commitment ain't it, I doubt if they can make it
Clown tears ran a smear through their painted faces
But I don't use foundation, mascara or concealer
Botox and toxic pealer, I come from planet realer
Where the sky is clearer

Ba-ba-ba-da-da
Holiday
Ba-ba-ba-da-da
Let's work it out
Ba-ba-ba-da-da
Holiday
Ba-ba-ba
Mark ya calendar

[Verse 2: Jay Electronica]
Don't get it confused
This message is for solo artists but I get at crews
We can make the news
I'll be on the low sippin daquiris in Baton Rouge
Or killing Rock The Bells with Mos and Posdnuos
It's a small task for Jay man
Wack niggas be dead and I be laughin
Sippin out my flask chillin in my Ray-Bans
Imaginary crime boss
With albums full and look at my watch at how much my shine cost
It's time lost
Who shot ya, the black Bach blastin over opera
Phantom of the chakras
Jay Doppler went from panhandling socks in the Bronx to popular
This is just the start of it
The kid intend to split more wigs than British Parliament
Catch me on the global warming tour with Jigga and Al Gore
Performing dear summer, where autumn went
Eternal sunshine, drum major without a drumline
I'll be in the D yellin kick rocks to one time
