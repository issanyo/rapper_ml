[Verse 1: Petite Noir]
Oh my god, it's been a while
I'm never gonna see that girl again
I can't take it, what doesn't know
I'm never gonna be the same again

'Cause it's all in my heart
'Cause it's all in my heart
'Cause it's all in my heart
'Cause it's all in my heart

[Verse 2: Yasiin Bey]
Heart beat like a drum and a breeze
You show sides you don't see, you don't need
Where the keys, open world, open sky
On and on and on and on and
To the place where the edge go round
Till the quiet is loud
Clear pronounced
Calling out your name
My edge ??? gonna stray
Stranger, you don't live, you don't stray
You don't change, you don't fake
But that's alright, I said that's alright
But that's alright, I said that's alright
Yeah that's alright
Okay, alright, said this alright
Okay, alright, said this alright
Okay, alright, said this alright

Heart beat like a drum and a breeze
You show sides you don't see, you don't need
Open world, open sky
On and on and on and on and
To the place where the edge go round
Till the quiet is loud
Clear pronounced
Calling out your name
My edge ??? don't stray
Stranger, you don't live, you don't stray
You don't change, you don't fake
But that's alright, I said that's alright
But that's alright, I said that's alright
Yeah that's alright
Okay, alright, said this alright
Okay, alright, said this alright
Okay, alright, said this alright

[Outro]
? towers, leavers
Down to some drifting
So eager to amaze and forget
So eager to amaze and forget
So eager to amaze and forget
So eager to amaze and forget
So eager, so eager
