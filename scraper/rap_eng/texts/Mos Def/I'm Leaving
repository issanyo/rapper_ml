[Intro]
Yeah
Yo yo what time the plane leaving?
Alright, see you at the airport

[Hook]
I'm leaving, on a jet plane
I don't know if I'll be back again
Kiss me and smile for me
Tell me that you'll wait for me
Hold me, like you know I'll never go
Even though you know I will
I'm a travelling man
Moving through places
Space and time
Got a lot of things I got to do
But God willing I'm coming back to you
My baby-boo
I'm a travelling man
Moving through places
Space and time
Gotta lotta things I got to do
But God willing I'm coming back to you
My baby-boo
I'm leaving

[Verse 1]
Well go'head and leave
The call heard around the world from the wives of MCs
These cats is paying more than half a pound
My garment bag'll snatch it down
Ain't got the skate, but we can probably run it back in town
Scenarios like this is tear jerkers
For the modern emcee, ie. the blue collar worker
Cause this thing called rhyming, no different from coal mining
We both on assignment, to unearth the diamond
While you start climbing in 'em, I start shining
You be struggling and striving
And they think you prime timing
Maintain and keep silent
Make note and observation
This confrontation
This is the daily operation
My concentration
Stay focused on my recitation
Bout to reach my destination
With no pause or hesitation
Baby make the preparation
Cause this ain't no recreation
This is pro-ball
And we lettin' you know y'all
At the show y'all
Doing this for dough y'all
Get the phone call
And I'm ready to blow y'all
Bout to go y'all
Been a pleasure to know y'all
And I'm lettin' you know that

[Hook]
I'm leaving, on a jet plane
I don't know if I'll be back again
Kiss me and smile for me
Tell me that you'll wait for me
Hold me, like you know I'll never go
Even though you know I will
I'm a travelling man
Moving through places
Space and time
Gotta lotta things I got to do
But Inshallah I'm coming back to you
My baby-boo
I'm a travelling man
Moving through places
Space and time
Got a lot of things I got to do
But Inshallah I'm coming back to you
My baby-boo
I'm leaving

[Verse 2]
But God willing I'll be back home
To drop these heavy ass bags up off my back bone
Around the world with a catalogue of rap songs
My baby girl is walking, been away for that long
But no you haven't well at least that's how it seem to me
My hometown is like a whole different scenery
The old timers on the stoop leaning leisurely
The new jacks up in the parks smoking greenery
Easily take it for granted when you up in it
But it's sweet scented, when you been down for a minute
Move around city limits, break 'em down with the vinitage
The inovinin', classical b-boy image
Collect the winnings
Cause it the reason that we came here
This thing is not a game here
The fortune not the fame here
From New York to the Cackalacks
Cali and the Cadillacs
Chicago no we innovate
Infiltrate Virginia state
DC make me stimulate
Philly know we penetrate
Georgia make us generate
Let's set a date to get the papes
They celebrate to my jams in foreign lands
Even your mans in Japan know who I am
Mina-san, make everybody out in Nippon
Say ichiban, me God man bo where you hitting from
Phenomenon
Scuse me that's a phone call
It's a show y'all
Trying to get this dough y'all
Bout to blow y'all
Been a pleasure to know y'all
And I'm lettin' you know

[Hook]
I'm leaving, on a jet plane
I don't know if I'll be back again
Kiss me and smile for me
Tell me that you'll wait for me
Hold me, like you know I'll never go
Even though you know I will
I'm a travelling man
Moving through places
Space and time
But Inshallah I'm coming back to you
My baby-boo
I'm a travelling man
Moving through places
Space and time
Got a lot of things I got to do
But God willing I'm coming back to you back to you
I'm leaving
I'll be back to you
I'm leaving
I'll be back to you

[Outro]
All over the world, we go
DC All over the world, we go
VA All over the world, we go
The Cakalacks All over the world, we go
London All over the world, we go
Japan we go over the world, we go
Paris we go over the world we go
