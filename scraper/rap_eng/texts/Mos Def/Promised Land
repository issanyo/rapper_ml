I left my home in Norfolk Virginia
California on my mind
I straddled that Greyhound, rode him into Raleigh
And on across to Caroline

Stopped in Charlotte and bypassed Rock Hill
We never was a minute late
We was ninety miles out of Atlanta by sundown
Rollin' out of Georgia State

We had motor trouble
It turned into a struggle half way 'cross Alabama
And that 'Hound broke down and left us all stranded
In downtown Birmingham

Right away I bought me a through train ticket
Ridin' cross Mississippi Clean
And I was on that midnight flyer out of Birmingham
Smoking into New Orleans

Somebody help me get out of Louisiana
Just help me get to Houston town
And there're people there who care a little 'bout me
And they won't let the poor boy down

Sure as you're born they bought me a silk suit
Put luggage in my hands
And I woke up high over Albuquerque
On a jet to the promised land

Workin' on a T-bone steak a la carte
Flying over to the Golden State
Oh, when the pilot told me in thirteen minutes
He would set us at the terminal gate

Swing low sweet chariot come down easy
Taxi to the terminal zone
Cut your engines and cool your wings
And let me make it to the telephone

Los Angeles, give me Norfolk Virginia
Tidewater, four, ten-o-nine
Tell the folks back home this is the promised land callin'
And the poor boy's on the line
