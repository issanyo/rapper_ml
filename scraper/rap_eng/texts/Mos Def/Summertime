[Intro: Mos Def]
New york city
It's the season, it's the time
You know
Sun is shining, weather is sweet
Make you wanna move your dancing feet
To the rescue
Let's go

[Hook: Esthero]
Take me, take me to the jump off
Summer time, summer time
Maybe we can fall in love

[Verse 1: Mos Def]
We rock it out like diamond in the back
Sun roof top my niggas on the scene
Brooklyn lets rock
You know how it is once the weather get hot
Got them tings on your mind
And nigga why not
Them mamis got sweets like a candy shop
They be young and they pretty with them candy tops
They be young and they pretty and they can't be stopped
Shit I'm young and I'm pretty baby - can we rock?
Of course, you make me go hard, you're so soft
Your Louis clutch and your lip gloss
Your shoes and top are so boss
You're so floss
So of course, I know you wanna rock with me
The Black D.A.N.T.E
The Mr Mos Definitely, woowee, so feel free
To get close, ma know me better
I like how it feel when our hips roll together
They just go together, it's just so together
When the beat go off, you can go wherever
But the plan now
Do the dance now
Push your hands out
Poke your back out
Yeah, yeah, mama, that's how
Sing it back now

[Hook: Esthero]

[Verse 2: Mos Def]
Listen
Don't say I never did nothing for ya
Don't say that Mos never put something on ya
Ah fuck it, say what you want, niggas
Like it or love it, hate if you want, niggas
Sun or moon, that's how it's going on, niggas
June to June, I get it 'til it's gone, niggas
From project bricks to porch and front lawn, niggas
To monster dares to every one of y'all niggas
Minnesota be straight jumping off
And your DJ gotta play that song - put it on, would ya?
New York City, I know it's been a long winter
This is the moment you've been waiting for all winter -
- and all spring, not a summer come
Ghetto [?] that cash glass bubbled up
Ghetto mass in a dance, and they huddled up
Young'uns in the mix, lights down, doubled up
It's so beautiful it's troublesome
And when it's gone you can't wait for another one the same
You remember (Exclusive)
And then it come back like

[Hook x2: Esthero]

[Outro: Mos Def]
Sun is shining, the weather is sweet
Make you wanna move your dancing feet
To the rescue
Want you to know, yo
Here I stand
Let's go
