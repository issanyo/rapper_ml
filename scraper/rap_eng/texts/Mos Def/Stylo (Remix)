[INTRO: (MOS DEF SAMPLE)]
Love, electricity, shockwave central
Pummel on the motherboard, yes
Push up, overload, legendary heavy glow
Sunshine, thunder roll, keep it all together
Yes the lantern burn, burn that easy
And broadcast, so raw and neatly
Thunder roll, sunshine, work it out

[VERSE 1: ]
Uh, five so right, I tell you I gotta get it
Grew so tall though I used to be a midget
And we go, got stylo
Bookin’ agents so we never do a free show
Tell em fear not, confidence can make fear drop
In the game on the plane til our ears pop
I look at life like what’s the purpose of it all
Stick with us so you’ll never see your budget fall
Stay true, they can’t corrupt us all
We fresh in LAX and still my mother calls
And Cali, I’m a big man, Pau GasolMathematically speaking I think it’s problem solved
I wish I had time to address challengers
But it’s not enough space on my calendars
Heads or tail I’m livin’ very monetary livin’
Very visionary searchin’ for the meaning like a dictionary

[Chorus (GORILLAZ SAMPLE)]
Oh Stylo
Go forth, blossom in your soul
When you know your heart is light
Electric is the love
When the mako flies
Up from the bottom in your eyes
Then I know the twilight skies
Not so broken-hearted

Right now, here’s what we gotta do

[VERSE 2]
And this the sound of a vengeance
I keep it movin’, I’m just gearin’ up my engine
You don’t know Chiddy, and you don’t gotta mention
I’m inchin’, Prime Minister shit, Winston
But, I’m still a dog, bring the kennel in
We could serve anybody that wanted, we Wimbledon
Two thousand and ten, the name scribblin’
Rap, playin’ ball, I’m spittin’, and I’m dribblin’
They lost focus for a minute, here’s riddlin’
Thinkin’ bout this and I’m thinkin’ bout that
Like how my life would be if I never wrote a rap
Would I low the gap, wanna say somethin’ and prob’ly hold it back
Yeah, it’s what I owe the rap
Cause before my future was Coca-Cola black
And doin’ what you love makes your heart race
And whenever we do it, we doin’ it at our pace

[Chorus (GORILLAZ SAMPLE)]
Oh Stylo (That’s it, I like that)
Go forth, blossom in your soul
When you know your heart is light
Electric is the love
When the sing yourself
Out of depression, rise above
I’ll be searching if I know your heart
Electric is the love

Right now, here’s what we gotta do

[OUTRO (MOS DEF SAMPLE)]
Love, electricity, shockwave central
Pummel on the motherboard, yes
Push up, overload, legendary heavy glow
Sunshine, thunder roll, keep it all together
Yes the lantern burn, burn that easy
And broadcast, so raw and neatly
Thunder roll, sunshine, work it out
