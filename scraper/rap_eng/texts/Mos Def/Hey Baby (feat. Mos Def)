I've been gone awhile away from you
And I hope you overstand
That I've got to do what I must do
To be a better man
Cause if I was to just to act a fool
Do nothing with myself
Then all my blessings would be cursed
My world would crumble in
It's a joy when I sit down and
Think of the good times that we have
And what we do to make it through
When the good turns in to the bad
Well I hope you'll find it in your heart
And know these words are true
And please don't fuss
Because I must go do what I must do

(Chorus)
Hey baby don't you worry
Even though the road is rocky
I'll be coming home to you again
Cause if you thought that I was lost
I had to bare my cross
Now I'm free from all these Chains

A time, a space, a different place
How perfect we might be
I would be the wind that blows
You'd be that Willow tree
And I could never bare the thought of you not by my side
So I would be the warmth of day
You'd be the cool of night
And everyday I pray to Jah that one day you will see
And overstand the fact I must fulfill my destiny
I hope you'll find it in your heart and know these words are true
And please don't cry
Cause you know that I must do what I must do

(Chorus)
Hey baby don't you worry
Even though the road is rocky
I'll be coming home to you again
Cause if you thought that I was lost
I had to bare my cross
Now I'm free from all these Chains

Well and it's not easy
Jah knows how I try, I try
So don't you get irie
Jah knows how I try, I try

[Verse: Mos Def]
And God knows, that life is one big road
With alot of signs and turns and twist and curves
Even though the road is rocky
But maintain to ride and keep on rockin
From, city to city backyard to yard
And we, be seein the cites standin under the lights
And the spot is hot it's cold and lonely at nights
And I'm feenin and I'm dreamin and I'm holdin you tight
But hold on, every single road I rode on
Come to an end and I'm back home again
So baby please don't cry
Cause no valley low and is no mountain high
And our love don't die with the passage of time
It just grow more, it just keep strong
And even though I'm gone I ain't never too far
Your the light through the dark shinnin right through my heart
So my journey just start
