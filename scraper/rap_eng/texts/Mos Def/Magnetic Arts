[Intro] [Mos Def]:

[Verse One]:
The arts magnetic
The flow is athletic
Dimensions is effected whether static or kinetic
And power blast pressure amass beyond measure
You can place son where ever he been strapped forever
The fresher get fresher and yes it's M. Deffer
The block ain't deffer and yes it's my pleasure to rock
And y'all pleasure for the pleasure to uh
And speed it up or break it down like whatever ya want
So we can roll with the block like however it come
An afternoon party special for everyone
I write a rhyme so expedient
Every show you see me in
Deep concentration, home school
Brooklyn
The arts magnetic
The flow athletic
Dimensions is effected whether static or kinetic
And power blast pressure amass beyond measure
The place, where ever, Bedstuy forever
The fresh get fresher, yes it's M. Deffer
The the block ain't deffer, yes y'all pleasure to rock
Y'all pleasure for the pleasure to uh
And speed it up, break it down however ya want
So we can roll with the rock, however ya want
An afternoon party special for everyone
I write a rhyme so expedient
Every show you see me in
Deep concentration, home school
Brooklyn!
