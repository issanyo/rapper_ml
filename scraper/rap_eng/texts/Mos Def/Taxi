Yea, uh , yea, uh-uh, yeah, uh yea, uh, uh , uh, uh

[Verse 1: Jalin Roze]
It goes ill...
Minds filled with a mine field
With my Illmatic track number 9 rhyme skills
Slightly inclined like im tryna climb hills
Chicks so fly she can ditch her high heels
First man in space Im Neil
Delivered, signed, sealed I deliver what every palm feels
When it comes to Fresh Prince Im Will
When I spill...
Ya'll might as well play dead lie still
Cuz young Jalin Roze put Lou, in the Blueprint
Can't find me boy, lost in the music
Fresh pair of penny's on, gotta give em' two cents
Cause a nigga Fresh out the Tribe, Q-Tip
Whole entire streets filled with rides no amusement
Parks, see my nigga's double park for amusement
Now every chick wanna hop on my broomstick
Up late night in the dark with the moonlit
Sharp like harpoons or a dart when I spew it
Bullseye guy Im the marksman of music
Now the whole Kentucky wanna see the kid do it
Fresher than 10 tulips, and a mint julep
Foolish niggas dance while I teach em something
"I thought you niggas would have seen it coming?"
Trust me brother I would keep it coming, but my meters running, so...taxi
