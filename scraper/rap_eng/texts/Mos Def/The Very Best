(Hook Mannie Fresh)
Just stand up, hands up, everybody get it
You want that real hip hop, well baby you should hear this
North side, east side, down south, west
And now you are rockin' with the very very best GO
(Verse one - Dee 1)
Backed by the best Mr Freshly, Sparks flyin' when I spit Lisa Leslie
Feel like the more they hate the more God blessed me
That's why I don't give a puck, Wayne Gretzky
F-E-E-L just how I be comin'
100 miles and running like a child ducking a woman
With a belt up in her hand saying boy I'm bout to tear you up
I used to catch the whippings now I'm whipping through the cut
Gotta pick my patna up, the whole city proud of us
Keep it realer then real, the only thing allowed of us
Man they don't know how bad I want this yo
I wants it more then I wanna breath, that's why my oxygen low
I'm lockin' the door, that's how I was raised
Time fly, 200 years ago our mommas was slaves
Tic toc, as I glance at my red G-Shock
The flow shock G's like 2Pac, man Dee too hot
(Hook Mannie Fresh)
Just stand up, hands up, everybody get it
You want that real hip hop, well baby you should hear this
North side, east side, down south, west
And now you are rockin' with the very very best, GO!
(Verse 2 Dee-1)
I'm in some kind of zone, I ain't tryna leave
I'm like the french apostrophes, I be over c's
Ok I'm lying, actually they over e's
But me and Mannie out in Houston like some Clover G's
Whippin' up some music, welcome to the movement
I can't die today because my point hasn't been proven
My patna looked at me and said that God is an illusion
But God be all I got admist this heart ache and confusion
And if you ain't winning, then you probably losin'
I'm hip hops alarm clock, the industry's been snoozing
Talkin' about these mollusks sounding really stupid
Your movement ain't a movement if your movement ain't movin'
Business still boomin, shorty's still jokin'
Ain't nothing change, you know grandma still smokin'
Haters still hating, evil still lurking
God Blessed the track homeboy, that's curtains
(Hook Mannie Fresh)
Just stand up, hands up, everybody get it
You want that real hip hop, well baby you should hear this
North side, east side, down south, west
And now you are rockin' with the very very best GO
(Mos Def)
You already know, Fresh, Dee-1
Man, lets go, man the very very best, you already know
Lets get it lets go, man, you already know
It bears repeating, the very very best, you already know
