Stay down

Blade in the pocket, jewels on a choppa
All they could do was watch it
Only God can start it
Only God can stop it
So they can stop it

Please, please, please
Please, please, please stay down
Please, please, peace
Stay down

Blade in the pocket, jewels on a choppa
Scents in the garments
Light in the darkness
Gleam on the armor
Only god can start it
Only god can stop it
All they could do was watch it
Stink tooth gossip
The view of the department
Means not an honor

Please, peace, peace
Peace stay down, blade in the pocket
Can't tell by how you walk
[?] breeds [?]
In touch with the doctrine
Crowns in the choppa
Jewels on the garment
Vampire started
Ain't even have no garlic
Views of the department
Means not an honor

Please
Peace, peace, peace
Stay down, blade in the pocket
Read no better topic
Jewels in the choppa
Only God can start it
Only God can stop it
So they can stop it
Light in the darkness, everywhere you walk
Vampire [?]
