Fresh!

A portrait in the mantle place realer than the shades
A hand on your shoulder and your dreams turn slow
Friend or foe? Debt, no it’s an asset
Medicine or madness?
Skywalking leaping for the beacon in the greater upper cabinets

Heaven stretch in degrees that don’t crease and creation can’t cease
So speak of reverence in its presence
Peace passed pleasure
Home is the adventure
Black master math can’t measure
Surname: Forever
High end, market low, impulse control
We mold ice cold, hot dice to roll
Stand sturdy like stones and bones

We all die and don’t stay dead at all
It’s a road every soul must pass along

Given in trust by the All for One and The One for all
That you are living in the building
Builders or demolitions
Openings and endings
