[Intro: Dice Raw] - x4
Hello hello hello hello

[Verse 1: Yasiin Bey]
Every anywhere: heights, plains, peaks or valleys
Entrances, exits, vestibules and alleys
Winding roads that test the firm nerve
Fortune or fatal behind the blind curve
The engine oil purr, lights flash to a blur
Speed work through the Earth, make your motor go 'scurrr'
Tonight at noon watch a bad moon rising
Identities in crisis and conflict diamonds
Blinding, staring at lights 'til they cryin'
Bone gristle poppin' from continuous grindin'
Grapes of wrath in a shapely glass
Ingredients influential on your ways and acts
Zero tolerance to raise the tax
It don't matter how your gates is latched
You ain't safe from the Danger Jack
Made it way before they made the map or a G-P-S
This is D-E-F leader

[Chorus 1: Dice Raw]
I know where I'm goin' even when it's dark
And being led down that road
(Hello hello hello hello)
You don't see that something's wrong
Earth's spinnin' outta control
(Hello hello hello hello)
Everything's for sale, even souls
Someone get God on the phone
(Hello hello hello hello)
Northside, nigga, Southside
(Hello hello hello hello)
Shit's poppin' off worldwide
(Hello hello hello hello)

[Verse 2: Black Thought]
Between the greenhouse gases
And earth spinnin' off its axis
Got Mother Nature doin' backflips
The natural disasters; it's like 80 degrees in Alaska
You in trouble if you not an Onassis
It ain't hard to tell that the conditions is drastic
Just turn on the telly, check for the news flashin'
How you want it bagged: paper or plastic?
Lost in translation or just lost in traffic?
Yo I don't wanna floss; I done lost my passion
And I ain't trying to climb; yo, I lost my traction
They makin' me break
My contents under pressure do not shake
I'm workin' while the boss relaxin'
Here come Mr. Taxman
He leavin' a fraction, give me back some
Matter fact, next paycheck, it's like that, son
I'll fuck around and have to hurt a few men
They probably chalk it up as a disturbing new trend
Hello

[Chorus 1]

[Verse 3: Styles P]
Should I say "hello" or should I say that "hell is low"?
Am I nigga or a niggero?
I'm an African American; they sell drugs in the hood
But the man, he move the medicine
He'll prescribe you all meds for everythin'
A little stuffy nose 'til you get some Claritin
You know I'm hip to it, and it's hard to claim the land
When my great-great-great-grands were shipped to it
Look at technology: they call it downloading
I call it downsizing; somebody follow me
Does a computer chip have an astrology
And when it fuck up could it give you an apology?
(Could it?)
Should it say "hello" or should it say "goodbye"?
Try to understand how smart and how hood am I
It don't matter though
Until we learn that the world don't turn right
We all oughta scatter though

[Chorus 2]
I know where I'm goin’ even when it's dark
And being led down that road
(Hello hello hello hello)
You don't see that something’s wrong
Earth's spinnin’ outta control
(Hello hello hello hello)
Everything's for sale, even souls
Someone get God {got} on the phone
(Hello hello hello hello) [x2]
