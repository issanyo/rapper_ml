[Intro: Mad Skillz (Mr. Eon)]
Yeah
What it look like?
Mad Skillz
Mr. Eon (the mighty Mos Def)
Mighty Mos (the E.C. Rawkus connection)
Coast to coast (from '88 to '99)
What what what what

[Verse 1: Mos Def]
It's on fire tonight
Everything on my side is looking alright
It's the high power original, b-boy traditional
Raw bass material, Brooklyn individual
True brand imperial you're hearing on your stereo
Transcribe the live, the Mos Def initial
Sit back and listen, you ain't in no position
To deal with my conditional mentally and physical
Strength is indivisible, crews be coming pitiful
Speech be sound typical, downfall habitual
Ock, I'm not feeling you!
Don't know what your label telling you
Or what magic beans they selling you
I can flow, you can't though, example
Of a cat who just a modern day Sambo (yeah)
Who be bitching out to A&R demands so
You can collect your little petty cash advance ho
You knock-kneed and sloppy, but not me
I'm I-N-D, E-P-E, N-D-E-N-T

[Hook: Mos Def singing]
It was a jam at the center and the party was shaking
And the poppers was popping and the breakers was breaking
And it won't be long til everybody know that
B-boys rock the document

[Verse 2: Mad Skillz]
Yo, yo, you on the injured, I'm hot to death
I'm foul, plus I'm winning, you think I shot the ref?
Rock a vest if you out of tone speaking
Cause I'm right there like nightmares, I catch MC's while they sleeping
I'm back, these rap cats is wilding
Got em in the studio poppin valiums, remastering they album
I'm about to re-up and restructure the case
You stuck, you about to get rearranged and replaced
I got plans for this rap game
Put your head in the toilet and look son
If you think my shit done changed
My shit is out of your range, rip you out of your frame
Cop your tape, and the next day, copped an exchange
If you ain't rocking raw, what you rocking for?
Without heat, y'all MC's ain't hot no more
So for you lame cats trying to put your hit out
Try rocking back and forth
It might be easier to get your shit out!

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Mr. Eon]
I'm Jedi Master, Mace Windu, what you been through
Keep MC's heads wrapped like Erykah Badu
Hip-Hop's Cleon Jones, when Eon Jones
Wackest MC's, we pee on those
No need to impede The High and Mighty mystique
That shit would be as ignorant as Jimmy the Greek
Claiming they Godzilla's when they really Godzooki
Got a mill' from Charlie Brown when I kidnapped Snoopy
Eon, sale or performance, in any ordinance
Rhyme menace, that burst your verbal nuisance
In accordance, with all the laws from the cordless
Starbuck coming through, leaving any pimp whoreless
Stereo stomping
Defeating me is like Latrell choking up John Thompson
Charles Bronson had a Death Wish for this next to left shit
Leaving all these hot air MC's breathless

[Hook]

[Mos Def]
I said b-boys rock the document (..ument ..ument *echoes*)

* DJ scratches "b-boy, document" *
