[Intro]
Bismi Allah
Na-na-na-na na-na
Na-na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na-na-na

[Verse 1]
They were staring at the stars
Count on this, you could never count them all
It goes like
Sky on fire, waves and moon
Everything you think you're watching watching you

[Hook]
It goes like this
It go like this
It goes
It goes like
It go like this
It goes
It goes like

[Verse 2]
They were staring at the stars
How it's bright while it's dark?
Ain't that odd? Perfect art
It goes like
How it's light then it's dark?
Then that dark fall apart
Perfect star, oh my God
It goes like this
It go like this
It goes
Inspiration, information
Revelation, confirmation
It goes like this
It goes like this
It goes
The poverty and the wealth of nations
Is not greater than the entire cosmic situation
You won't escape it

[Outro]
Oh na-na-na-na-na na-na
Na-na, na-na
Na-na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na-na, hey
Woke up feelin' some type of way
Just glad I woke up today
