"This is your captain speaking, with just a little flight information
Coming up on the left we're going to be catching a glimpse of the Grand Canyon
On the right you can be able to see the Hoover Dam
In just a a few minutes. We're flying at an altitude of 37,000 feet
And our air speed is four hundred miles an hour...
Couple a little facts here, I'm packing a Colt King Cobra
That's a .357 caliber firearm with a black rubber-grip and a six inch barrel
Also, the co-pilot is carrying a Kimber Custom defense pistol with all the bells and whistles you'd expect from a custom gun of that kind with an alloy frame and bevel treatment on the entire gun
And our Chief Flight Attendant Roger has a uh Ruger Bearcat, that .22 with a hand-fluted cylinder
All three are capable of piercing body
Armor at a distance of up to twenty-seven feet and you can put a hole
In human bone and flesh the size of the Grand Canyon, which
By the way is coming up on the left hand side of the plane, so just
Sit back, relax, and enjoy the rest of your flight..."

Mentioned that he worked for the embassy
People seem to find that interesting
High status, intrigue and mystery
Special code name on the hotel registry
I love it when they say
"Enjoy your stay"
They say how they mean it
Cause that's the way they been trained
Show you to your room
A suite with a view
When, if anything at all
Do not hesitate to call
Nice! The greatest, the greatest
Compliments, tooth brush, tooth paste, razors
A Bible, a Qur'an in a drawer
Or depending where you are
Tend to whisper through the walls
She was calling on God
The greatest, the greatest
Salutations, congratulations
Reservations, exclusive arrangements
Dinner with the patrons, the scenery is amazing
It's so outrageous, they whisper when they say it
When it's really real it's even realer than "The Matrix"
Classic, modern, ancient, flagrant
Get a special thrill every time they get to say it
Peace! I work with the embassy
On behalf of imagination industry
I come visit, you come visit
Such a pleasure, official business
La, la, la, la...
La, la, la, la, la-la-la-la...
