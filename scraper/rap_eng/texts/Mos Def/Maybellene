Maybellene, why can't you be true?
Oh Maybellene, why can't you be true?
You've started back doing
The things you used to do

As I was motivatin' over the hill
I saw Maybellenein a coup de ville
A Cadillac a-rollin' on the open road
Nothin' will outrun my V8 Ford
The cadillac doin' 'bout ninety-five
She's bumper to bumber
Rollin' side by side

[Chorus]
Maybellene, why can't you be true?
Oh Maybellene, why can't you be true?
You've started back doing
The things you used to do

Pink in the mirror on top of the hill
It's just like swallowin' up
A medicine pill
First thing I saw that Cadillac grille
Doin' a hundred
And ten gallopin' over that hill
Offhill curve, a downhill stretch
Me and that Cadillac neck by neck

[Chorus]
The Cadillac pulled up ahead of the Ford
The Ford got hot and wouldn't do no more
It then got cloudy and it started to rain
I tooted my horn for a passin' lead
The rain water blowin' all under my hood
I knew that was doin' my motor good

[Chorus]
The motor cooled down, the heat went down
And that's when I heard that highway sound
The Cadillac a-sittin' like a ton of lead
A hundred and ten a half a mile ahead
The Cadillac lookin' like it's sittin' still
And I caught Maybelline at the top of the hill

[Chorus]
