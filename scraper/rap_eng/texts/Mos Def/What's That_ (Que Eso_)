[Mos Def]

I took Spanish One for four years, so um, I'ma spit my shit right here

Oigame malo muchacho
Mos Def con Tony Flaco
El idioma que yo hablo
Pretty young champ like Camacho
Spittin' a hot flow
B-boy shout Zulu Gestapo, bro
You know my stylo
Cigarillo con tamarindo
Habichuelas negras
Arroz amarillo
Yo soy suave, viejito
Campeon nacional como Tito
Bringin' the heat, bro
Unique when I speak, yo
Do it my way like Carlito
Beats by M-a-s-e-o
From Pelham Bay to Puerto Rico
Play my beats on Caliente Noventa Siete
On the expressway and press play
See what ya neck say
Duro siempre
Para mi gente ganamos
Se 'cabo then gabamos
Gorillo hacen la manos
Blowin ya spot like they got toast
A lot of MC's is def but they not Mos
And not close
Son understand that when I shine
All your light is through
Y'all niggas wack in one language son
I'm nice in two
Fuck is you?

[Chorus]

(Que Eso?)

Tu no sabes?
Mis sonidos
Siempre ganamos
Nunca perdimos

(Para quien?)

Blanco, negro, latino del mundo
Cuando multo
Que profundo

(Que Eso?)

Tu no sabes?
Mis sonidos
Siempre ganamos
Nunca perdimos

(Para quien?)

Blanco, negro, latino
Gorillos
All those street folks
Yo bonito

[Plug one]

Hey yo, I cop chips to ziplock grips the verse
Non-conventional original b-boy
My peeps call me Merce
I'm from NYC so CYN me
There's a lot of hustlin' found around my chi
Sip the strawberry daq' that ain't never been fucked
Tryin' to catch me off balance, man you shit out of luck
Cause we got more rams than I drive in y'all
Got the people at the jams more alive than y'all
I'm with Tone Touch while you all touched in the head
Such a lethal combination got you facing the red
And um yo
You don't want no part to that
Your style's so pussy your last name should be cat
We takin' it back like sleestacks and pylons
With the ladies in a frenzy runnin' they nylons
Reveal flesh to test cuz I love bruisin' em
Treat my battles like my children, nigga
I'm never losin' em

(Hey yo, what's that?)

You don't know?
That's my sound, yo
No one can rock it like this
We put it down, yo

(For who?)

Black, white, purple or brown, yo
It's Mos, De La and Touch
We hold the crown, yo

(Yo, what's that?)

You don't know?
That's my sound, yo
No one can rock it like this
We put it down, yo

Black, white, purple or brown, yo
All my street folk
C'mon gather around yo

[Trugoy the Dove]

The only Spanish I knew was dame un beso
Caught bitches with niggas who nettin' the peso
Y'all breathin on beats like this?
If you say so
I stay sippin on god theories
Yo where the case, yo
Weight falls on fourth floors like film edits
Fuck saying the name, y'all read it in the credits
Sit down and on my lyrics
We servin niggas up some beans and rice
Everything is everything
Heavy metal thing
Rock with Mos and Pos diners
Written flows get broke down by the commas
From here to I lawn
Green shit up in my wallet
Fly to warm places and get red like scarlet
How I dollar
I just earn the save
So when the itchy itchy come
I satisfy the crave
And let it fall a little too much
I let Tone Touch my ears
To make the bullshit disappear

[Tony Touch]

Pa' fuera
Tu no sabes?
Mi manera
Native Tongues puttin it down
Donde quiera
De La, Mos Def with a candela
De Borinquen
Que bonita bandera
Respect the architect
Or be next to catch a vela
Send y'all all runnin home to your abuela
Catch wreck over a beat
Or accapella
Kick a wicked rhyme like a fortune teller
This fella
Se pone feo quando llego
I still be shoutin out cats in San Diego
I'm still in effect and I'm still doing the huevo
I'll still be puttin it down til I'm a viejo
Man you can't tell me nuttin' about the juego
I told you all suckers before
Leggo my eggo
Yet you insist upon playin with fuego
But I catch you on the rebound
Hasta luego
Pendejo

[Chorus]

(Que Eso?)

Tu no sabes?
Mis sonidos
Siempre ganamos
Nunca perdimos

(Para quien?)

Blanco, negro, latino del mundo
Cuando multo
Que profundo

(Que Eso?)

Tu no sabes?
Mis sonidos
Siempre ganamos
Nunca perdimos

(Para quien?)

Blanco, negro, latino
Gorillos
All those street folks
Yo bonito
