Before Mr. Taylor taught the world to play
Before fiberglass
Before parquet
Before the word "Doctor" was spelled with a "J"
And ballrooms were ballcourts where the Renaissance played
Before the hype and before the dunk
After the rhythm but before the funk
Before the money and before the fame
Before new school and old school
Before school had a name
It was only a ball and the soul of the game
The First School
