Slim brown skin i be
Standin' 5'10" I be
Rockin it when I be in your Vicinity
Raw style synergy recognize
Symmetry constant to the edge of me
Broken down chemically
Ain't another ten emcee talkin' 'bout
How been i be styled like Kennedy
Late like a ten to three
When I say when I be girls say venga aqui
Cause they tend to be way out like
Tennessee take me to a place called the BK
Without pause or delay yet run like Penn Relay
Don't deal with he say she say
Ain't workin' for no cheap pay the Mos Def beat
This is what the streets say
Hey Mr. DJ: Play that devil MO'gain
That Jam got me open
Beside to break it broken from
Front front side to side middle to back
Never the wack I come from Bedstuy, Black
From Louis A-V-E to be exact
BROOKLYN!! BROOKLYN!!!
