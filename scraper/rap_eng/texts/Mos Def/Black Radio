[Intro]
Experiment:
Black radio
Experiment, black radio

[Yasiin Bey]
Radio, sucka never play me
Triple shade of black that my bleach should never fade me
They say he crazy
New York raised him in the 80s
Kill the Koch administration
Gangster renovation
Born in isolation-ation
Ill communication-ation

Ma Bell fiber optic
Presidential miscroscopic
Soul sonic remedy
Clinic right in the street
Operating in the dark
Surgery your wounded heart
Come together peel apart
Peel apart come together
Smoking on something good
Praying for something better
From out of better
Never rocking for forever ever
Ever ever ever ever
Forever ever ever ever

It's still a secret even when you tell em dumb dummies
Hush money, rent receipt and drug money
They cold gutter, want gun money
The chief rocker, fuel-injected Zulu horse proper, love boogie

Big bird flying down on a mountain pass
Only thing to survive the crash

You wanna fly free go far and fast
Built to last, we made this craft
From Black Radio
