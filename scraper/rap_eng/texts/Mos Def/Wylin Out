[Diverse]
My mind compliance like a science
Analyze my data, not a fader on the face of the earth
Can blend rhythms like my will, surreal spinnin
Ever-movin like evolution it's retribution
For sellin roots, lessen futures, I'm steppin to fuchsia
Sun rises, my subconsciousness culminates constant
Live to see various i-de-ologies, angles like isosceles
Read my auto-b-i-ography
So many sides of me that vibrantly shine
Velocity's properly thick like mahogany dimes
We findin beauty in this urban-gritty usually overlooked by many
Movin through the densely populated city
Assuming eventually 'we gotta get ova'
I document culture closer to the edge
Bolder than the print, open to interpretation, gazin deep into the glitz?
To my people, raise you fists
I know it stays intent, whatever pays your rent, but saves your soul
You know the drill, it go:

[Mos & Diverse simultaneously]
Hotter than most dudes
From left to right, on top and below you
Flow like the coastals, move like smoke do
-I'm Diverse- these other cats is just hopefuls
When they ask who put it down, baby, you know who
Tell your whole crew, it's somethin that you need to know, dude
This is how we go through

[Mos]
Who the poisoned pen?
Mos got the inkwell full of serum
Prescribed for any emcee claimin they ill
A small dose'll change the way that they feel
Milligrams of the raw, snow-cut, check how I label a pill
It's MD, the spit-doctor, chant like a witch-doctor
Recite me, and ya whole ailment get proper
I'm the, medicine man, representin my clan
Mixin the potion with diversify and seven, my man
And stay shoutin out the home team wherever I am:
It's the B-R-O double up K-L-(w)Y-liN out
The cowboys who don't fret to pull they Llamas? out
Iron horse style cab?, Coup de Ville ridin out
No lights, no cam, action - drama'd out
?? out, absorb the shit that I'm about
Inner-city Bruno, ghetto folks, holla out
I'm good money, tell the doubters get they wallets out
Hot when the dice is out, they go broke findin out
Smack ya mojo, caught a half of 'oh no'
Magical vocals, get it there like postal
Underground nigga that spoke truth and broke through
Shine bright when I'm far from my close-to
I told you, you know how Mos do

Hotter than most dudes
From left to right, on top and below you
Flow like the coastals, move like smoke do
-I'm Mos Def- them other cats is just hopefuls
When they ask who put it down, baby, you know who
Tell your whole crew, it's somethin that you need to know, dude
This is how we go through

[Diverse]
Exposed to a higher set of variables, as fly as aerial
Definin stereo components, moments with my master
Remasterin techniques, havin some fresh sheets
Damagin margins with a broader outlook - 'we lookin out, y'all'
Me and Mr. Mighty Mos, we outlaws
Blazin in the saddle, raisin like the mornin star, formin majestic
Candescent like the street lamps, I-be-amped to inn-o-vate
Reminiscent of technology, probably just my will to build
To real notions of emotions similar to the seven seas
Steadily sparkin cables, tables turnin like the high tide
I'm captive to this music, vastness, into it I skydive
Tumblin like buildings crumblin on inner-cities cumbersome
They comin in to run us out, my niggas shout for justice
You wanna link with me, then let me know
This music is like my vessel so we seem to be inseparable
From C-town, headed eastbound
You know the rest, it go:

Hotter than most dudes
From left to right, on top and below you
Flow like the coastals, move like smoke do
-It's D-I- these other cats is just hopefuls
When they ask who put it down, baby, you know who
Tell your whole crew, it's somethin that you need to know, dude
This is how we go through
