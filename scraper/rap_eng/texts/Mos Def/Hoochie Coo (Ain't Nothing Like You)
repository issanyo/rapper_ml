[Intro: Mos Def]
Pure heart
I love you

[Hook: Mos Def (w/ Dan Auerbach singing in the background)]
Pure heart
You’re super cool
You’re live and elemental
You’re sweet and you’re true
You're so true
Oo-ooo-oo-ooo
You’re plain and yet so special
It's nothing like you
You’re so cool
You’re sweet and rude
You’re so plain that it's special
Its nothing like you
Well aww hoo
Oo-oooo-oo-ooo
You make me stand up, and holla
"Do the Hoochie Coo!"
You’re so cool

[Verse 1: Jim Jones]
They told me pain only shows you where you going
You get to laugh then that shows you where you been
And when you get the cash that only shows you how to sin
Like when you getting fast money and you blow it in the wind
Where we from success one in a million
We thought success was getting money in front the building
End of the summer we was counting up the killings
Like they killed baby boy tryna run up in the building, now--
Love: I bruised one of her rose petals
She was from the concrete and came up out the cold ghetto
But so gentle
But it appears like, on a clear light it could thunderstorm
Want some more?

[Hook: Mos Def (w/ Dan Auerbach singing in the background)]
Oo-ooo-oo-ooo
Pure heart
I love ya, pure heart
Pure heart
Uh-ooo-oo-ooo
Ha, it's nothing like you
You’re so
Do-doo-do-doo
You’re live and elemental
You’re sweet and you’re rude, so cool
And fiery too
You’re plain and elemental
You’re sweet and you're rude
You’re so true

[Verse 2: Jim Jones]
Most say I’m politically incorrect
But most people scared, they spit it so indirect
I been accused of, same thing as you but, I refused to follow rules of who--
The complexion of politics done changed
And the computer glitch put so many problems up in the game that uh--
I'd probably still be selling ‘caine if I, didn't get a chance at the stardom or the fame
Being humble is a hard quality to achieve when your ego is crazy with no modesty
We make good music just using The Black Keys
And I'm flyin' through the hood in my newest of black V's, Peace!

[Outro: Mos Def]
Wahoo-oo-ooo
You’re plain and elemental
Ain't nothing like you
Your pure heart
