Oh, walking with my baby, she got great big feet
Long, lean and lanky and had nothing to eat
But I love her, love her just the same
Crazy about that woman 'cause Caldonia's her name

Caldonia, Caldonia
What makes your big head so hard?
Oh mama, I love her just the same
Crazy about that woman 'cause Caldonia's her name
