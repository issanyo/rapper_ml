[Intro]
Uh huh uh huh uh huh
Oh this takes me home
It makes me think about sitting outside of my old home when I was younger and singing something like

(K'Naan in Somali)
Gabaryaray shuxaano
Maro Shabeel eh xirato
Maro qafiif eh huwato
Magacaaga ii sheeg
Magacayga waa Sharaf
Sharaf, Xaaji weyaan
Aqalada xiriirta
Dhinac baa ka jooga
Ala yaa usheega?
Tinta ushaleeya?
Naa hoéy Zamzamey
Sabaax nuurey
Adoo kilkiley
Iyo
Kaloon badanay
Adoo xajka jira
Xasuus badhanay!
Saxiibtaa
Caasho, cashaq baa dhilay
Ugu dhambaystina
Aniga iyo geel uba
Ugu banaan bixin
Waa aniga orodneey
Nabad dheynee
Mareekan waa laga soo waayey
Mareekan waa laga soo waayey
Mareekan waa laga soo waayey
[Repeat x2]

[Verse 1: K'Naan]
There are certain things fresh and certain things mish
I got my own sound I don't sound like the rest
And even my attire and my choice of dress
And not long ago I don't spoke English
My point is police pull me over a lot
They wonder what kind of rap sheet I got
And sometimes I take a young girl out to eat
And hold the door open, "Oh, you're so sweet!"
Of course my affection's super illustrated
And I like to give don't reciprocate it
Unless you could give me someone innovated
Well lets cook it up we dont refrigerate it
But back to the country of the educated
Where people get robbed and they celebrate it

Waa aniga orodneey
Nabad dheynee!
Mareekan waa laga soo waayey
Mareekan waa laga soo waayey
Mareekan waa laga soo waayey
[Repeat x2]

[Verse 2: Mos Def]
Maraken, my country 'tis of thee
Sweet land for robberies
Dope smoke and SUV’s, red meat and army greens
Fat and frills, thrills and spills
Eat and sleep, hump and kill
Shop til you drop, work til you dead
Get all you can, then get in the wind
Outta my face on your knees
Sleep in the mansion, shut out the streets
Make that cake, whoop that trick
Lick my swagger suck my sick
Get high get low get stcky get rich
Get yo own show get down get quick
You slow you blow you broke your fix
Terror dome, home swag home
Terror dome, home swag home
Home swag home, home swag home

(Somalian(America))

[Verse 3- Chali 2na]
There are some things pure while certain things blur
Dilute it with the lie and you believe when it occur
Falsified information got my people in the stir
We have to be in search of something equal to the cure
Straight out the door, I come to give you more
Lay the law keep it raw, when I speak it from the core
Get underneath your skin like especially with the claw
Conflicted with the rich cuz I kick it with the poor
I laugh in the face of adversity
Sound clashed with the bass cuz its natural to me
But if you pay attention to the past you will see
Not long ago you black they'd hang your ass from a tree
Certain things things change, while some stay the same
Some are recluse others are lovers of the game
I'm trying to walk the lane, the Sirat al-Mustaqim
Instead of doing things they keep you covered in the flame

(Somali)
Nanananana that shit was cool in English, but let me get that Somali verse
(Somali)
