Top 40 Un-rah! (Underdog)

Bey
Soft shoulder, imported cotton, single button
I ain't gotta talk loud to be sayin' somethin'
They doin' them, I'm doin' this
I'm too legit... Why would I quit?
They brains in they ass, what they talkin' with
You can smell it on they breath, they just talkin' shit
Get a tic-tac and get back
Or get jacked.... Rack-a-lack
Scared of who? Not at all, not nobody here
Not nobody comin', not nobody there
Trill, therefore movin' on
The simple shit don't move me move along
Bey
Surname of the sovereign
Or raised in the belly of the beastly as Gotham
Still clean so nice it's mean
Flaco el guapo Boogeyman Yasiin
Somebody said I was a star
They got it right
My black is brighter than the dark... Ha
My black is brighter than the dark... Ha
My black is brighter... Bey
My black extra and longer like February 31st, 2/32, or February 33rd
If I die today remember me like I'm me
Flaco el guapo Boogeyman Yasiin Bey
I was born at dawn
I was born at dawn
Birth name Dante I was born a don
Yasiin Dante at it on to dawn
Yasiin Dante that's just more of Dawn
Lord... Forgive 'em what they know not
Cool 'em off and out open pie and closed shop
Bey Coffee too strong they can't sleep well
Up top flow chilly chill freeze help
Brooklyn shoulders broad eatin' well and small
Belly forever flat my motto never whack
Bigger house bigger v ain't a bigger man
Cause they better off don't mean they better than
Lord... Forgive 'em what they know not
Souped up and flood water to your stove top
Bey wide awake haters can't sleep well
Pro-flow ice cold chilly chill... Freeze
Yeah I'm a star they got it right
My black is brighter than the dark
My black is brighter than the dark
My black is brighter....
Bey
