"When I'm down, I just draw some roses
On a pretty piece of paper
With my recipe open
So halfway through, I feel so much better
I imagine happiness, and it runs right to me, such amazing beauty
You don't have to, cut up no roses
Please just leave them living
Got my pencil, got pretty paper
Please don't worry we're forgiven"

[Chorus]
"I have found, just the perfect feelin'
Finally cause I'm grateful
I can feel your spirit, comin' closer on me
It is grand, just to be reminded
Reminded of the good things
Living in a new day, that no one can tear down
You don't have to, cut up no roses
Please just leave them living
Got my pencil, got pretty paper
Please don't worry we're forgiven"
"Yellow for friendship, red for love
Black for the universal stars above
Pink buds that I bought her on Valentine
She said it was forever then she changed her mind
I said a little prayer then I cleared my eyes
Cause the [? ]
Started off with a oget, natural poget
I ain't Picasso but that ain't important
Faith, smart dude never graduated high school
Stay tuned I'm a show you how my art move
Shape and dimension flow and extension
Symmetry shade, blowin' out the frame
Sign off my name Dante when I'm finished
Put it to your memory for permanent exhibit
Love, hard work and it's worth every minute
Abstract is still life real life kinetic"

[Chorus]
"Got my pencil, got pretty paper
Please don't worry we're forgiven
You don't have to, cut up no roses
Please just leave them living"
"When I'm down, I just draw some roses
On a pretty piece of paper
With my recipe open
So almost through, I feel so much better
I imagine happiness, and it ran right to me, such amazing beauty
Got my pencil, got pretty paper
Please don't worry we're forgiven
You don't have to, cut up no roses
Please just leave them living"
