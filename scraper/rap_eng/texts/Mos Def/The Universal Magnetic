[Intro]
Yeah, ha ha ha
A-B-boys rock the world
CD's and tapes help generate papes
E-F is the end part of Def
G-good, H is what style be
When I grab the microphone and MC
Roll off the tongue like L-M-N-O-P
And when I am done you will agree
Mos Def represent most definitely
Jeans is what I used to rock in '83
Drank up all the Kool-Aid at the block party
Used to wish I could break with Rock Steady
Watched Tenspeed and Brown Shoe on TV
But now it's not dis and it's on like this
My name is Mos Def, this is good as it gets
Baby I make you rub your mitts like sardines and grits
My shit still hit, even when the record skip
Even when the record skip
Even when the record skip
I don't quit, I don't quit
We 'bout to make this one the sure hit
Shawn J. make the party people feel it

(Ladies and gentlemen, we'd like to introduce a very
Interesting young man that has traveled from very far
Away to be with us tonight)

There is such a place that creates such a melody
Brooklyn! Go ladies!
It's a living dream, it's a living dream, it's a living dream
Love like this!

[Verse 1]
Recognize all area crew
Whether you speak Japanese or Goonie Goo Goo
Son when I come through, other rappers boo-hoo
Cause they know they style's soft like baby doo-doo
I will continue to hit like a fifth of Stolichnaya
Putting jokers on ice to get the cream like Breyers
No secret, Mos Def is the one the hons admire
I get in my stance and set the dance on fire
Spread out my wings and I take the world higher
Peace to the fam magnetic in the Chi
Jah Born, Top Sean and my man Ato
And all my other clan who reside in the Zoo
Got the celebrated oatmeal broadcast brew
Mos Def gon' keep it naked like Umfufu (Eddie!)
Words adhere to the tape like crazy glue
So when they bounce out of speakers they stick to you
The way that I communicate is non-typical
But eye level like a 3-D visual
I hold the mic extension, exhibit level and dimension
And radiate the space like a upright bass
Yo son I leave crews laced and escape with no trace
Sound official like the finish time at a horse race
Here to put it in place, for the nine-uno-seis
Mos Def set the pace, make your fam give chase

[Hook]
Raise your hands in the air, everybody get with it
Universal Magnetic B-Boy, scientific
It's like that and you don't stop
It go on to the rhythm you don't stop
Raise your hands in the air, everybody get with it
The Universal Magnetic B-Boy!
Scientific y'all, you don't stop
It go on to the rhythm you don't stop

[Verse 2]
Baby it's in my chromosomes to rock microphone sets
Who wanna test the M-O-S just leave that shit alone
I make no bones or poems about dropping bars
Make the world fall sway under the Mos Def, yes
I ring the alarm like Tenor Saw
My style hella-raw, I keep it raw bone like Skeletor
And you should go and tell your clientele
That they need to get the message like Melle Mel
I got the shit on lock like a death row cell
And if I ain't a b-boy, Premier never used a bell (ding ding)
So tell your poor ass crew to retire
Before I make they ass catch fire like Richard Pryor
Non-descriptive fiending for riches, calling Earths bitches
But most of y'all brothers is living with your mothers
The boogie man yanking up your covers
Sharper than some new box cutters, on Parkay's and butters
And Stevie Wonder's, to make you run and tell the others
The beat lovers, and play my jam like the numbers
Son I rock the globe like I rocked your boat
I'm 'bout to tap it on your shoulder cause you got to know

[Hook x2]
