[Verse : Yasiin Bey]
Pay day, you're a winner...
Pay day, you're a winner
Keep cool form a line
Scared money, broke money
Bold money, mo' money
So sunny, cloud breaker
Sound make a wave run-up
Wild wonder, funky drummer
You can get it how you wanna
There's math and there's dealers then players then me
They say that they're winners, okay, well, let's see
You pay or you play
The rules of the trade
The math of the days
The times and the age
Whatcha want? How you like?
Aim high, man, why not?
Sun, moon, and starry y'alls
Each and all of y'alls
Mathematics and dealers then players then me
They say that they're winners, okay, well, let's see...

[Hook]
