(Verse 1)
Wake up in the mornin!
And I give thanks and praise, Open up the gift called a brand new day
This life is fantastic
It's easy
It's hard
It's intense
It's young
And on and on and on!
Road around hometown on the day I was born
There somethings changed and don't change at all
Like the ghetto feel the pressure on coppas keep stepin on them, hungry got their chopper loaded and it could pop at any moment
Say a prayer for the sick and the sufferin
The odd-turners
The hardworkers
And hustlers
The sinner and saints
The cons and there customers
I came up with them
I keep in touch with them
I show love for them
And show love again
I plant a seed and grow love again
It's most elegant
It's celebrated long time
A lovely the horn that starts decorated voice that of imagination, inspiration information
Salute to Zulu Nation!
It's like peace
Unity
Love
Let's have some fun

(Hook)
It's like Def keep rockin it, you should be rockin it
Brooklyn rockin it
You should be rockin it
Deckstream rockin it
You should be rockin it
And there ain't no stoppin' the sun

(Chorus)
Life is good
Only Yahweh
Life is good
Let's go ya'll (keep goin on)
Life is good
Shit all the time
Life is good
Only Yahweh
Life is good
Go hard keep rockin on
Life is good
Shit all the time

(Hook)
Once again
It's like Def keep rockin it you should be rockin it
Deckstream rockin it
You should be rockin it. Whole world rockin it
You should be rockin it
And there ain't no stoppin' the sun

(Verse 2)
Today I got a call
It was Umi on the horn
Her voice so cool said son
You're a jewel
Protect minor heart and you're soul won't lose
If they prove aren't true
Then don't be deeply fooled
Take care of yourself
Creator got the rest
And never mind stress
Just do your best
So plain so sweet and it hit me so deep with all the blues in the news, that's news that I need
So give thanks
Spread love
Proceed
Not so slow or too swift
God speed
Cruise control and
Rule the world and
Move your body body
Take in short
And stay humble
But be proud
Cry when you need to and laugh out loud
Like peace
Unity
Love
Lets have some fun

(Hook) x2
Its like Def keep rockin it, you should be rockin it
Deckstream rockin it
You should be rockin it
Brooklyn rockin it
You should be rockin it
And there ain't no stoppin' the sun
Once again

(Chorus)
Life is good
Only Yahweh
Life is good
Let's go ya'll (keep goin on)
Life is good
Shit all the time
Life is good
Only Yahweh
Life is good
Go hard keep rockin on
Life is good
Shit all the time

(Outro)
Peace!
