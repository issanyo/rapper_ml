Streets are spawn and most of Mark Ronson
Call the fire chief to inspect the arson
Y’all got problems, Brooklyn is in the buildin’
We built the buildin’

Easy to touch but it’s hard to hold
Easy to meet but it’s hard to know
Paste this one across ya domes and spread it out all across the globe
Heat it up and keep ‘em on dey toes
I’m like the diamond in the mind, I was born to glow
Drop Paul on or off the roll
Freak daddy stroke long and slow, I break ‘em down type strong, then blow
Heading right back to B-R-O, okay L-Y and homo wild porridge
Streets without mercy, nights without silence
Lee without skill is like Gars without science
Jake without sirens, life without dyin’
I’m hot without tryin’, ya heard it so now buy it
Joint come on, you start whinin’

Streets are spawn and most of Mark Ronson (It’s the M-O-P, we gotta!)
Brooklyn is in the buildin’, you got problems
(Ma friendly I have you)
Whole world from the native to the foreign, I’m up on it

I’m one hundred percent nigga, first fam’ to owe me that’s behind me
We'll fuck up a whole city like Rudy Giuliani, you plastic
You don’t wanna go at it, so (stop)
You ain't ready for the aftermath, the matics are (pop)
I wandering with Y-H from the tri-state, ya violate
I just need to go _____ prostate
It’s the M-O-P
And we on the run for real, from the left to the ten
I bin hearin’ you holla (gangsta) for fifteen years now
But when you went, well the shit went down
Come on now
We rugged rap singin’
Rob niggas for prattling and keep their rings
Tell your man, Bill did it he, he reeled with it, killed with it
Little pissed off homie take the loss, deal wid it
While y’all get it goin’, we’ll get it done
A million and one, ma friendly, I had you faggots on the run

Streets are spawn and most of Mark Ronson (It’s the M-O-P, we gotta!)
Brooklyn on the premises, you got problems
Ma friendly I have you
Whole world from the native to the foreign, I’m up on it

Yo, Ron Pharrell Pharell, M-R-M-D (it’s the M-O-P ma nigga!)
You know what I’m sayin’

I wanna fly in the sky, let my lyric carry me
I’m gonna fly, fly, fly, fly

We have em’
