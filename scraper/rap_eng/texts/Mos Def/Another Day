[Verse 1: SanDmaN SDN Aziz]

Rastai hattasilam dekhi bhage dui jawra
Jayya dekhi Niroho manush er koshto guli khawa
Corrupted shala go moddhe nai kono niropekkhota
Shalar ashol rup khulse tai ei nayebiruddhota
14 boyoshe polay prothom guli kore
16 boyeshe  prothom khoon kore

17 boyoshe bepsha shuru korte aise
Karon baaper kalo taka bohut paise
Bohut manush tare urayte chaise
But tarr bodole  cha pani khaise
Shalara ghush dite aise bhai tomra moro
Im going out for this shit enough fake sorrow
But We won't do this today cuz we still got a tommrw
Amar kotha bujhte na parle amader shate cholo
Tokhon bolo
Walking in the streets,  looking at the niggas on a fray
More niggas coming to settle out but their word's ain't gonna sway
And I know homicide's the only key and there's no other fuckin way
But imma say hey, I can't wait, tommrow is another day..

[Chorus: Yasiin Bey; (SanDmaN SDN Aziz)]
Tommorow is another day
Today is another bomb
Tommorow is another day
Today is another bomb, bomb
(Kalke arekta din
Shomoi roise bohut kom
Tommorow is another day
Today is another bomb, Go!)

Bomb bomb bomb bomb bomb bomb bomb bomb bomb (x4)

[Verse 2: SanDmaN SDN Aziz]
Tui amr jagai aite chaile tor bhasha kor shuddho
Tui past re future banaite chaile ami korum juddho
Kintu tui aaj re kal banaite chaile tui hobi mukto
Abar eitar shathe rap re koris na jukto
Cuz jokhon ami first
Kono killing verse
Shunsi khaisi shock
Shokh ailo rap er moddhe baki shob pura flop

Bhua rapper ailo for some pok pok
Hoes in background saying cock cock
Haters ashtase comments e knock knock
Tui kor boyya boyya bog bog, but this ain't a dog show
I dont play for drugs or ho, i play for the flow
Ami taka kamaile khushi hobe na tor bou
Laal pani khayya shobuj taina taka kor noshto, So...
Walking in the streets,  lookin at the niggas on a fray
More niggas coming to settle out but their word's ain't gonna sway
And I know homicide's the only key and there's no other fuckin way
But I'mma say hey, i can't wait, tommrow is another day..

[Chorus]

[Outro: SanDmaN SDN Aziz and Mos Def]

[SDN]
Our time is coming
We rappin they askin how
Right now they wanna play
When they'll call me I'll say
[Yasiin Bey]
Another Day!
Bomb bomb bomb bomb
Tommorow is another Day
Bomb bomb bomb bomb
(Shomoi Roise bohut kom!)
Bomb bomb bomb
Bomb bomb bom bomb!
