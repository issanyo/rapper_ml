[Intro]
Bis Mil'Lah
Basquiat Ghostwriter

[Hook]
Kayo in the Luna Park
The whole livery line bow like this
With the big money all crushed into these feet
A lot of Bowery bums used to be executives
Pay for soup, build a fort, set that on fire

[Verse 1]
Most young kings get their heads cut off
Kayo in the luna park
Free sprayin' on the trunk in the Fiat
So, that's what we have, provisions
Go hard like I'm J.M.B. with paint
Ain't no blinkin', cook what they thinkin'
I will ride for this real in every single way
L T P F J, freedom every day
See Lupe that's my fuh muckin' nigga
He love computer games, smokey I ain't playin' with him
Ya'll seen Flacko base stunna hood black thrilla
Five percent coca in the corners my niggas
Ain't no hate tracks
Ain't no distance
Life is too good gone with the bullshit
Hey Huxley what you smokin'?
Don't let the arcade put you in the coma
Go hard, yeah
(?) my fuh muckin' nigga
He love computer games, I don't play with the cheerin'
Five percent coca in the corners, my niggas

[Hook]
Kayo in the Luna Park
The whole literary line out like this
With the big money all crushed into these feet
A lot of Bari bums used to be executives
Pay for soup, build a fort, set that on fire

[Verse 2]
One sports, two opera, three weapons
Kayo in the Luna Park
Free sprayin' on the trunk in the Fiat
So that's what we have for Hollywood Africans
Pop corn sugar cane
Tax free heroism, 200 yen
Gangsterism, origin of cotton
Power plus money
Value without nobility
So hard
Ain't no blinkin'
Think what they thinkin'
I will ride for this real in every single way
Love, truth, peace, freedom, justice, every day
My city got the arcade jitters
Computer comas, I ain't playin' with 'em
Basquiat Bey, great
Five percent coca, niggas

[Outro]
Kayo in the Luna Park, freeze frame
The whole literary line out like this
With the big money all crushed into these feet
