[Verse]
Feel free, it’s you and me
Yo, [?] like Dilla and Thriller
Snuff King Kong, Magilla Gorilla
Yo, what’s a Martian to the Lord?
Another tiny speck, another tiny speck
Paranormal panorama, panorama paranoia
Say it three times twice
Shoutout to the families of Tamir Rice
Shine bright like the light
And ain’t got no fright
On stage, or a cage
What’s a crow to an eagle? Nothing
What’s a crow to an eagle? Move something
Do something, do something real
Do something
Hey Huxley, whatcha smoking?
Get out the arcade, we ain’t joking
Young blood is flowing
Get your focus, guns is smoking
Jails is open
But your schools is closed, fuck type of rules is those?
Leave the devil exposed
Come out your clothes, you looking like hoes
That’s how it goes, that’s how it goes, no
I guess for those who chose not to glow
But me, never mind show love
Too tough, I make ‘em all blush
In a rush, not at all
Sensei, easy motion, no waves on this coast
Many ways on this coat
Niggas don’t even know
And niggas ain’t niggas we the bestest and the freshest
Not lesser, never mind the pressure
I make the diamond glow brighter
That nicer, flashing lighter
Tighter and tighter
Hold on, hold on baby, hold on
Hold on, hold on baby, hold on
We too strong, this nonsense can’t go on
No suckers allowed, if you black be proud
And we here right now
It’s a country called Earth
The righteous kingdom and niggas ain’t niggas
Niggas ain't niggas
But we the freshest
Something special
Never mind the pressure
End up, go stronger and better
And get fresher
Stay free in your endeavours
Tell the visa man whatever
I’m in the weather
And finna treasure
And never mind the pressure
Growing fresher
Fresher, fresher
Forever and ever, forever
Forever ever, forever ever
Forever, forever ever
Forever, forever ever, forever ever
Forever, forever ever, forever ever
Think happy thoughts
And keep your hoes in check said Denmark Vessey
Think happy thoughts
And keep your hoes in check said the young poet
Think happy thoughts
Zulu Nation is creation, Zulu Nation is creation
We want no colonial fiction
Zulu Nation is creation
The native nation is creation
The original nation is creation
We want no colonial fiction
Freedom
What’s a crow to an eagle?
What’s a crow to an eagle?
What’s a crow to an eagle?
What’s a crow to an eagle?
Nothing at all, not even a bird song
