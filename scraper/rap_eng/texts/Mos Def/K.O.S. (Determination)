[Verse 1: Talib Kweli & (Mos Def & Talib Kweli)]
So many emcees focusin' on black people extermination
We keep it balanced with that (knowledge of self), determination
It's hot, we be blowin' the spots, with conversations
C'mon let's smooth it out like Soul Sensation
We in the house like Japanese in Japan, or Koreans in Korea
Head to Philly and free Mumia with the Kujichagulia (True)
Singin' is swingin' and writin' is fightin', but what
They writin' got us clashin' like titans it's not excitin'
(No question), bein' a black man is demandin'
The fire's in my eyes and the flames need fannin'
(The fire's in my eyes and the flames need fannin')
(The fire's in my eyes and the flames need fannin')

[Pre-hook: Talib Kweli & (Mos Def & Talib Kweli)]
With that what? (Knowledge of self) determination
With that what? (Knowledge of self) determination
With that what? (Knowledge of self) determination
With that what? (Knowledge of self) determination
With that what? (Knowledge of self) determination

[Hook: Vinia Mojica]
Things I say and do, may not come quite through
My words may not convey just what I'm feelin'

[Verse 2: Talib Kweli & (Mos Def & Talib Kweli)]
Yes yes come on, yes yes
Knowledge of self is like (life after death)
With that you never worry about your last breath
Death comes, that's how I'm livin', it's the next days
The flesh goes underground, the book of life, flip the page
Yo they askin' me how old, we (livin' the same age)
I feel the rage of a million niggas (locked inside a cage)
At exactly which point do you start to realize
That (life without knowledge is death in disguise?)
That's why, knowledge of self is like life after death
Apply it, to your life, let destiny manifest
Different day, same confusion, (we're gonna take this
Hip-hop shit and keep it movin'), shed a little light
Now y'all bloomin' like a flower with the power of the evident
Voices and drums original instruments
In the flesh presently presentin' my representation

[Pre-hook: Talib Kweli & (Mos Def & Talib Kweli)]
With that what? (Knowledge of self) determination
With that what? (Knowledge of self) determination
With that what? (Knowledge of self) determination
With that what? (Knowledge of self) determination
With that what? (Knowledge of self) determination

[Hook: Vinia Mojica]
Things I say and do, may not come quite through
My words may not convey just what I'm feelin'
Things I say and do, may not come quite through
My words may not convey just what I'm feelin'

[Verse 3: Talib Kweli & (Mos Def & Talib Kweli)]
The most important time in history is, (now), the present
So count your blessings cause time can't define the essence
But you stressin' over time and you follow the Roman calendar
(These people into cloning like Gattaca), you can bet
They tryin' to lock you down like Attica, (the African diaspora
Represents strength in numbers), a giant can't slumber forever
I know you gotta get that cheddar whatever
Aiyyo I heard you twice the first time money, get it together
You must be history, you repeatin' yourself out of the pages
You keepin' yourself depleatin' your spiritual wealth
That quick cash'll get your ass quick fast in (houses of detention)
Inner-city concentration camps where no one pays attention
Or mentions the ascension of death, (till nothing's left)
The young, gifted and Black are (sprung addicted to crack)
All my people where y'all at cause, y'all ain't here
And your hero's using your mind as a canvas to paint fear
With broad brush strokes and tales of incarceration
You get out of jail with that (knowledge of self determination)
Stand in ovation, cause you put the hue in human
Cause and effect, effect everything you do
And that's why I got (love in the face of hate)
Hands steady so the lines in the mental illustration is straight
The thought you had (don't even contemplate)
Infinite like figure eight there's no escape

[Pre-hook: Talib Kweli & (Mos Def & Talib Kweli)]
With that what? (Knowledge of self) determination
With that what? (Knowledge of self) determination
With that what? (Knowledge of self) determination
With that what? (Knowledge of self) determination
With that what? (Knowledge of self) determination

[Outro: Vinia Mojica & (Talib Kweli)]
Things I say and do, may not come quite through
My words may not convey just what I'm feelin'
Things I say and do, may not come quite through
My words may not convey just what I'm feelin'

(This the funky singing by Miss Vinia Mojica
This the funky singing by Miss Vinia Mojica
Knowledge of self)

Things I say and do, may not come quite through
My words may not convey just what I'm feelin'
What I'm feelin, what I'm feelin, ooooh, what I'm feelin'
