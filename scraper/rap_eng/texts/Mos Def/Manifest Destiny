[Ces :]
You are about to enter
The manifestation of a family cipher
The Urban Thermo Dynamics
Is about to hit you right about now

[Verse 1 : Ces]
I'm just here to let you all know
I got the flow and the locks that grow
I love the nappy heads, the braids and afros
Kicks Adidas, jeans Girbaud
This is how we go and this is how we do
This how we be, we are the big U
You don't know me and I don't know you
But if you wanna set it, do what you gotta do
I keep my flow with the one and two
That equals three, first letter C
Second letter e, last joint s
Styles manifest from Key West to Budapest
Nevertheless don't need no S on my chest
"Yo, why Ces?" Cause I'm superblessed
Save all the stress 'fore I clean up the mess
And if it ain't no, then it must be yes
And if it's the bomb, then it must be Ces
And if it's the bomb, then it must be Ces
I got the exposure to keep my composure
I'm meetin quotas from Minnesota to Dakota
Takin no shit from the rap promoter
Cause if they ever try to, they shit is over
Murky mixture, what's goin on?
I leave the party bumpin till the break of dawn
Break of dawn, break ya down
Yo Mister [Name], I like that sound
Put on the weight cause it's more than a pound
So if you want some of what I have
Meet me on Deklab or Fulton Ave
Or Albee Square, a hop from the D
Manifest Destiny, it must be (What?)
Manifest Destiny, it must be (What?)
So check it out

[Verse 2 : Mos Def]
Well if it ain't red, then it must be blue
And if it ain't false, then it must be true
And if it ain't day, then it must be night
And if it ain't left, then it must be right
And if it ain't ( ? ) then it must be hype
And if it ain't loose, then it must be tight
And if it ain't off, then it must be on
If it ain't here, then it must be gone
If the shit ain't proper, then it must be wrong
Whatever don't fit does not belong
Sunrise to sunset, that's dawn to dusk
The big U, a name that you can trust
The big U, a name that you can trust
The big U, a name that you can trust
Lay around on the middle ground, kid, you could die
It's game time, son, you better choose yo side
Half-measure will no abide
If you ain't all the way live, then step aside
The deep Medina Green is where I reside
And it's about time that this Brooklynite
Took the mic and made the world get hype
You wanna be hardcore, try livin right
Man, niggas be puttin up a hell of a fight
Many times I stumble off the righteous path
But ( ? ) on my ass
But I promise on high plains I take the rocks
I got the ( ? ), I will not be stopped
I gotta manifest des', what ock, you think not?
The verbal juggernauts will make a party lick shot
I tread a road more narrow than a ( ? )
Comin from the bottom, so I'm risin to the top
What, and you don't stop

[Hook : Ces & DCQ]
Self-actualize and realize, do what you got to do
If you can see it, you can be it, manifest, it's up to you
Everbody self-actualize and realize, do what you got to do
If you can see it, you can be it
If your mind can go there, then why can't you?
If your mind can go there, then why can't you?
If your mind can go there, then why can't you?

[Verse 3 : DCQ]
Nowadays heads be makin me mad
Talk a good game but they legs is bad
Yappin at the mouth with the wish I had
Hops, do yourself a favor and get off your ass
You ( ? ) in between
Runnin round town sellin dreams and beans
Screamin word is bond, but what's your word worth?
Before you indict yourself, fool, think first
And if it's my word, then it must be bond
And if it's my word, then it must be bond
And if it's my word, then it must be bond
And the word is, the big U got it goin on
Cause in the ( ? ) we takin down vultures
Peace to all those who represent the culture
To the kings and the queens of the universe
Aiyo, we gotta shine the light, aight?
Aiyo, we gotta shine the light, aight?
Aiyo, we gotta shine the light, aight?
