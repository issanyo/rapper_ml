[Intro: Yasiin Bey]
Love, electricity, shockwave central
Power on the motherboard, yes
Push up, overload, legendary heavy glow
Sunshine, thunder roll, keep this on
Yes, the lantern burns firm and easy
And broadcast, so raw and neatly
Thunder roll, sunshine, work it out

[Refrain: 2D]
Overload, overload, overload
Comin' up to the
Overload, overload, overload
Comin' up to the
Overload, overload, overload
Comin' up to the
Overload, overload, overload
Comin' up to the

[Verse 1: 2D]
Oh, Stylo (juice)
Go forth, blossom in your soul
When you know your heart is light
Electric is the love
When the mako flies (a giant fish)
Up from the bottom in your eyes
Then I know the twilight skies
Are not so broken hearted

[Hook: Bobby Womack]
If this love is electric
It'll be flowing on the street
Night after night
Just to get through the week
Sometimes it's hard
Right now

[Verse 2: 2D]
Sing yourself (juice)
Out of depression, rise above
Always searching if I know your heart
Electric is the love

[Verse 3: Bobby Womack]
There's only one way
Let it pray a little while longer
It's got a way of passing through man and woman
In another world, in another world, and in the universe, oh!
Right now, here's what we got to do

[Hook: Bobby Womack]
If this love is electric
It'll be flowing on the street
Night after night
Just to get through the week
Sometimes it's hard
That's what I'm talkin' 'bout...

[Intro repeated: Yasiin Bey]
Love, electricity, shockwave central
Power on the motherboard, yes
Push up, overload, legendary heavy glow
Sunshine, thunder roll, keep this on
Yes, the lantern burns firm and easy
And broadcast, so raw and neatly
Thunder roll, sunshine, work it out

[Outro: Bobby Womack]
Right now!
