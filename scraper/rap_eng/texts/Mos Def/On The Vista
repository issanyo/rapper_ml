[Verse 1: Mos Def]
Highlights, clear view on the vista
Stars so close, you can reach out and kiss one
Bright waves roll easy and still
Sparkling and deep
Rude and sweet
Dream what you like, but you dare not sleep
The lights on the riverbanks, they just much reach
How much lessons did they teach
For the bounty that they seek
Angels over each of these
As the heavens just increase
And the mountains surrender, final call
The on and the only, the all-for-all
All gone, and it goes on and on
And when it's done on-ing, it just ons some more
Majestic and lonely, magnetic, raw
Odds, post-something that God's wicked awes
Magic wave fresher than all's, yes y'all's
And on and on, and on and on and on
'Scuse me y'all, magnetic, raw
And on, and on and on and on
Yes, yes y'all
To the beat y'all
Feel free y'all
It's unique y'all
What it do, what it is, what it be y'all
Fuck money, live up, and get free y'all
Yes, yes, y'all
To the beat, y'all
Numerous and luminous
Conduits in the reservoir
Bright lights, high lights on the vista
Stars so bright, you can reach up and kiss one
Bright waves roll easy and still
Majestic and deep
Dream what you want, but you dare not sleep

[Verse 2: Mos Def]
Highlights, clear view on the vista
Stars so close, you can reach up and kiss one
Bright waves roll easy and still
Sparkle in the deep
Rude and sweet
Dream what you like, but you dare not sleep
The lights on the riverbanks, they just must reach
How much lessons did they teach
For the bounty that they seek
Angels over each and each
And the heavens just increase
And the mountains surrender
Final call
