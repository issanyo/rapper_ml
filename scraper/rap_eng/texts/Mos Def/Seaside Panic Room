[Verse 1]
Seaside view in a panic room
Don't press 'less you really need to
This chopper ain't with the breakfast toast
Keep clear if you won't let it go
Seaside view in a panic room
Stand clear if you're insincere
Heed the advice and [?]
If you read this you already know

[Chorus]
Gone, gone, gone
Gone, gone, gone
Gone
Gone, gone, gone
Gone, gone, gone

[Verse 2]
Antelopes perched at the nearest wall
Mosquitoes, mosquitoes, ugly birds
Register the banter, but don't react
Silence of the lions perfect trap
What need to be said been already said
Experience the blade not the rhetoric
Keep the chopper close with the breakfast toast
Born ready rock steady on the ready roll
Seaside view pretty panic room
Treachery don't [?] point in space
Trust God, tie your camel
Radio clear 99th channel
Gone, gone, gone
Gone
Gone, gone
Thinkin' about it I don't mind
Eyes wide in the sunshine
Instead you in it one time
Radio clear on that nine nine
Thinkin' about it and I don't mind
Eyes wide in the sunshine
Ain't worry about the one time
Radio clear on that nine nine, nine nine, nine nine

[Chorus]
Gone, gone, gone
Gone, gone, gone
Gone
Gone, gone, gone
Gone, gone, gone

[Outro]
Wide open door on the panic room
Thankfully the wall was [?] thin
The last trace of bath water on your shoulder
The moon light through the dark on your skin
