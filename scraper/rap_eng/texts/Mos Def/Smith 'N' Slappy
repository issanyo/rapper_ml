Hey, what you want, baby?
Ha-ha, it's what you need, baby
Ha, what you feel baby?
Ha-ha, I got all of that
True indeed indeed indeed
I got it, ha-ha
I got it, yeah yeah
I got it, I got it, I got it

I got a Smith 'n' Slappy grind for you (what you got now?)
I got your payment here in kind for you (what you got now?)
I've got a piece of never mind for you (how'd you get that?)
I've gotten over underlinin' you in red

Recall Marley dealin' it, big willin' it
How you feelin' it? Watch the snow bird gonna fly the whole world
Speak with forked tongue, and the beating down the war drum
In your schemes and dreams of fortune walk one
Caution! keep the chin up, blink the eye out
Keep the infidel with the wishing well to dry out
Find out they only lie about what they cry out
Architect-designed but psyche psyche their mind out

Time out, expect that, correct that, check that
They put you on a setback, bounce like a jet pack
Promises and guaranties by modern day pharisees
They use familiarity to push peculiarity
Bubblin' hot, trouble 'n' spot, bomba claat
Kids framin' the biz, claimin' they is what they're not
Most definitely Scritti Politti on the dot
Me and Green on the stage, get you need, so we got

Come 'n' rock-a me now
Come and teach your teacher how
Come 'n' shock-a me now
Gonna show the people how (c'mon bring me party)

Come 'n' rock-a me now
Come and teach your teacher how
Come 'n' shock-a me now
Gonna show the people how (c'mon bring me party)

I've got a dark and canine day for you (what you got now?)
I've got tomorrow put away for you (what you got now?)
I've got the tokens here to pay for you (how'd you got that?)
I've got a not a lot to say for you, surprise

Most definition, got more lines than a petition
Lay you flat, break the track in half, like intermission
With the raw rap, got your back like raw strap
International like them pancakes, toss that
World travellin' unravellin' the mystery cats who're dissin' me
Get the boot like Italy, when I land like Sicily
It'll be considerably warmer in the spot for those who got bad karma
I'm gonna put it on you but for now

I'm just chillin' 'cause I got that feeling
If it don't move you then you're numb like penicillin
Full committee with Politti, main objective gettin' busy
From the shores of Green Medina to the home of Sarafina
To the stairs of Catalina, everywhere inbetween that
I'll make your whole denomination react, believe dat
Ooh we at, top of the dial, rocking your file
Sound clash number one to wear, this is how we're runnin' it

Come 'n' rock-a me now
Come and teach your teacher how
Come 'n' shock-a me now
Gonna show the people how (c'mon bring me party)

Come 'n' rock-a me now
Come and teach your teacher how

Movin' out like, what it sound like?
Competition gets speechless in my thesis
Resonatin' like the atco from the macho
Getting busy from the get-go from you pet show, rough or gentle
You recognise it's something special
Acapella instrumental, all essential
Use my pad and my pencil to draw the mental
Got a number one again, yo, tell ya can't fall, bring it in bro'

Come 'n' rock-a me now
Come and teach your teacher how
Come 'n' shock-a me now
Gonna show the people how (c'mon bring me party)

Come 'n' rock-a me now
Come and teach your teacher how
