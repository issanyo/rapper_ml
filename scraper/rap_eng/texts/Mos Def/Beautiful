(yes you are, you're so beautiful)
Fantastic

Absolutely fantastic

Absolutely fantastic
(on my feet)
All the world fantastic
(beautiful)
Absolutely fantastic
(come to me)
*quietly*(scientifically, scientifically)**
Fantastic
(down again, so we'll wash it over me)
Fantastic
Fantastic
Fantastic

(Tell the world)

[Yasiin Bey]
I dreamt that I could paint you in words
But there were no colours, bright enough
Black or white enough
Blue or green enough
It didn't mean enough
You are the star to touch the earth
Shine bright for all eyes to see
Radiate and touch me
Now I'm shining like you do
It was dim before I knew you
Bright light for weeping eyes to get used to
Trust who? that's some shit I had to adjust to
Soon as you relax they ease back and cold bust you
Love murdered in Brooklyn, sound the alarm
But you sit remain calm
My passion is unarmed
I try to practice my warlike tactics
But in your clutch, in your touch
My armour, just collapses
Such bliss breeds obliviousness
I recollect sweet breath still wet on my lips
My prayers this:
God protect my beloved
And keep her covered
From the valley to the summit
Like the land undiscovered
Like the stars unnumbered, you are so beautiful


[Mary J. Kweli & Yasiin]
Beautiful
[im doing my best so I can be true to you]
Now you're near
[ain't nothin in this world I wouldn't do for you]
In my life
[you're my everything more than ever and usual]
All my fears
[like the stars unnumbered you are so beautiful]
Beautiful
[you shine so very far from where I stand]
Come to me
[from a distant land understand who I am]
Down again, someone watching over me

(Talib Kweli)
You know what
They say that beauty's in the eye of the beholder
So I use my third, and now our love is solid like a boulder
Wanna build with you as I get older, and thats my word
Sure as I stand on my ancestor's shoulders
You see through my drama and my world like a stage
Not the same years but livin in the same age
Its the kwelity not the quantity
Follow me?
Def-in-ate-ly
Far from probably
Got to be
You and me, beautifully, fit like pieces of the man I used to be
Now I'm back cause of what you do to me
You like my reflection, better half to my whole
Like lyrics to the beat, you the mate for my soul
The breath for my life, my sister and my lover
Used to have cold feet, now you the warmth under my covers
I can't ignore your aura cause it grabbed me by the hand
Like the moon pulled the tide and the tide pulled the sand

[Yasiin]
(Go ahead, Mary, baby, sing your song)

[Mary J. Blige]
Oh, so beautiful
That dream that it would be so beautiful
I wanna say that I love you
All the love you give, all the love you give to me
All my days and nights were lonely
And it's so beautiful
And now I have a friend that I can talk to, yeah
Boy, you're so beautiful

[Yasiin & Talib]
Because you're fruitful, beautiful
Smart, lovable, huggable, doable like art
Suitable to be part of the cosmos
With my eyes closed, I see you clearly
Combined lifetimes with like minds, your lovelight shine
Bright the apple of my eyesight
The tender kiss that whet my appetite
My mighty Aphrodite, the flame that ignite me
Your name just excite me
Your eyes so alive they invite me
Cause you are so beautiful
You don't even know the length I would go
To make absolutely sho' you is respected and protected
And never neglected, I hope my prayers is accepted
That you always will be watched over
And never rocked over
And if you need me to, I'll stop over
To check on you, I'd never jet on you
I know a lot of foolish cats that slept on you
But what I'm gon' do is be totally committed
If you need me I'll be hotter than a New York minute
With a hundred percentage, from the start to the finish
Cause the vibe you give leave me so replenished
It's a new beginning, this is serious business
Got my heart and soul in it
It's the way that I'm living
Let it be noted the devoted is gon' always prevail
The newly risen, true and living Universal for real
It's like that y'all, and ya don't stop

[Mary J.]
You're the only love I know, Beautiful
You're the only love that knows, Beautiful
You're the reason why I live, Beautiful
You're the reason why I want to give you everything

Since you came into my life...
