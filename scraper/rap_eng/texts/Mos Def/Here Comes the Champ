[Intro: Yasiin Bey & Anwar]
M-Def
Ayo, ayo
Dan The Automator
Ayo, ayo

[Chorus: Yasiin Bey & Anwar]
Uh-oh, Uh-oh
They gonna stand
Uh-oh, Uh-oh
Set it off, settlin’
Uh-oh, Uh-oh
They gonna stand
Uh-oh, Uh-oh (clap)
Set it off

[Verse 1: Yasiin Bey]
Yo, Special delivery, boogie man, the specialist
Wind ‘em down like the shot clock stop shop
Drop the rock on your rock box
Deep freeze all your hot shots (cool)
Nothin’ to prove, just somethin’ I do, son
Me have the evidence, just set it off and settlin’
Don’t even put it on the scale to weigh
Off the chart, too heavy for the scale to stay
Homie put it in the air, watch it sail away
Spill pressure through the tribe, make it rain n’ rain
Still roll when I made the lane, and I made you wait
So alright, okay-di-kay
More real, more live than what the papers say
It’s all love, and it ain’t a game
So it’s safe to say
You know who I am
Uh-oh
Here come the champ

[Chorus: Yasiin Bey & Anwar]
Uh-oh, Uh-oh
They gonna stand
Uh-oh, Uh-oh
Set it off, settlin’
Uh-oh, Uh-oh
They gonna stand
Uh-oh, Uh-oh (clap)
Set it off

[Verse 2: Anwar]
From the park to the parquet, it’s game time
Stroke the long J, drive the base line
Gots to get low, watch the waistline
Reach out [?], crossover, you beat
Same thing with the rhyme
Cross over on the beat
Ride the bassline, this that jam
Make it get low, move your waistline
The champs are here
Hurry through the grapevine
It ain’t a act, it’s a natural fact
Super M-DEF puts speech on the track
Tell the DJ to play that back (set it off)
We’re them boys gonna play like that (set it off)
Before the game was a game, before the shot clocks
Before the limelight, when it was hip-hop
Out in the park, the champ had ‘em shook
With verses of magic, they ended with a hook like

[Chorus: Yasiin Bey & Anwar]
Uh-oh, Uh-oh
They gonna stand
Uh-oh, Uh-oh
Set it off, settlin’
Uh-oh, Uh-oh
They gonna stand
Uh-oh, Uh-oh (clap)
Set it off

[Verse 3: Yasiin Bey]
Yo, past the glory, past the cheers
Past the plane and I brush into jeers
Above the haters, under the radar
Beneath the underdog, over the top dog
The rebel yellin’ quiet tenacity
The lonely playground, stadium capacity
Sunlit jeans to the real life fantasy
The fever pitch, the media insanity
The unexpected, the grime, the monotony
The better it gets, the better that it gotta be
Sacrifice and condition
The reality, we on a mission
Just don’t stop, you get it
Can you dig it?
I know you can
Uh-oh
Here come the champ

[Chorus: Yasiin Bey & Anwar]
Uh-oh, Uh-oh
They gonna stand
Uh-oh, Uh-oh
Set it off, settlin’
Uh-oh, Uh-oh
They gonna stand
Uh-oh, Uh-oh (clap)
Set it off

[Bridge: Yasiin Bey & Anwar]
Set it off, set it off, set it off (what)
Set it off, settlin’, settlin’
Peace (Anwar)
Yes
M-Def (M-Def)
So fresh
Na-na, na-na
M-Def
Dan the Automator
Special originator
Creator with the flava
For the whole world to savor
Major, major (Oh!)
Uh-oh, Uh-oh
They gonna stand
They gonna stand
We are the champs
Uh-oh, Uh-oh
My soul is a champion sound

[Outro: Yasiin Bey]
M-Def
Data Automator
So Fresh
F’real
