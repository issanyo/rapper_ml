[Intro: Mos Def]
Yes sir, yes sir
You know the runnings
Excellence always
Brooklyn embassy, haha
Black Star shining
You are now rocking with the best
Brooklyn's own, Brooklyn's only
M-O-S definite
Big shout out to Cash Money, Shy and Medina Green
Listen...

[Verse: Mos Def]
Three words for the con, no you aren't
Smoke smoke but you're no cigar-a
Soon as Mos hit the open market
The ghetto know to cop it
Get on my back like a open warrant
Brook-lyn sick so retarded
Hop on your phone and told your partna
Hop offa him, and told your mama
Got no type of focus problems
Y'all better focus harder
Get out your rhyme book and smoke some scama
Ever far you go, I'm going harder
Understand I, rock today like it's no tomorrow
Last year, my catalog was so impressive
That this year my rookie card's a great investment
Am I hot? Nigga change the question
Are you hotter than me?
Shit we can take out the product and see
Y'all don't want no drama with me
Without a part in a film
A director and a call from the guild
Y'all don't want no problems for real
So why you speaking of beef?
Y'all youngins don't y'all need to be sleep?
Cause secretly I'm the nigga that you dreaming to be
It ain't as easy as that
It's only one Mos, leave it at that
Whatever shine you had I'm leaving with that
I give a fat baby's ass where your peoples is at
And where your heaters is at
You fuck around and catch a leak in your back
Get a hug dogg you need to relax
Don't get beaten up cause of rap
And don't get mad at me cause you're whack
Shit genetics is the reason for that
You ain't seeing me I'm seeing to that
I'm from the brightest hardest star to ever be on the map
And that's the B-R-O-double y'all don't want no trouble rest
Mighty motherfuckin Mos Def... like that
