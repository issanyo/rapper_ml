And you don't stop
A yes, yes, yall
A freak, freak, yall

This is hip hop

[Pre-Verse]
You see I come into the party in the b-boy stance
I rock on the mic and make the world make raise their hands
Fly like a dove, they come from up above
I'm rocking on the mic and you can call me Mos Love
I come into party in the b-boy stance
I rock on the mic and make the world get down
Fly like a dove, they come from up above
I'm rocking on the mic and it's Def, Def

[Verse 1]
And it's the black, fantastic, raw dynamic
True ecstatic, ghetto outstanding
Classic, active, every place it happens
Skill, power, passion, raise your red lantern
Stanzas are anthems, based on expanding
The vantage point in the past, present, and after
Rapture, mantra, ceremonial master
Craft of the masterminds that craft masters
Faster and viber from Brooklyn island
Legendary asylum, Black Star shinin'
Bedford-Stuyvesant, it isn't Strivers
Flatbush, blazing like it spoke to the prophet
In this constant, remarkable artwork
And God is the author, and Flaco the archer
It's right on target, ready steady responsive
Black light bright in the darkness, gorgeous

[Verse 2]
The black, fantastic, raw dynamic
True ecstatic, ghetto outstanding
Classic, active, every place it happens
Skill, power, magic, raise your red lantern
Stanzas are anthems, based on expansion
A vantage point in the past, present, and after
Rapture, mantra, ceremonial master-
Craft of the masterminds that craft masters
Faster and viber from Brooklyn island
Legendary asylum, Black Star shinin'
Bedford-Stuyvesant, it isn't Strivers
Flatbush, blazing like it spoke to the prophet
In this constant, remarkable artwork
And God is the author, Flaco the archer
We right on target, ready steady responsive
Black light bright in the darkness, rawness

[Verse 3]
The black, fantastic, raw dynamic
True ecstatic, ghetto outstanding
Classic, magic, every place it happens
Skill, power, passion, raise your red lantern
Stanzas are anthems, based on expanding
The vantage point in the past, present, and after
Rapture, mantra, ceremonial master-
Craft of the masterminds that craft masters
Pieces and chapters, volumes, turn it up
Make it bump so they feel where I'm coming from
Brooklyn island, legendary asylum
Black Star shinin', vibrant, timeless
Perfect timing
Bey!
