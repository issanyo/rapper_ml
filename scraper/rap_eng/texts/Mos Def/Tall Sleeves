Bismillah
[Hook]
Could have been down with the team
Should have been down with the team
Coulda, shoulda bees no honey
This hive is live
Coulda, shoulda bees no honey
This hive is live, get busy

[Verse 1]
Xans, xans, xans, coco popper, proper work
Knock a nigga out in my pajama shirt
Space, do the calendar
Paranormal, panorama phenomeners
Frantz Fanon and I'm on and on
Shots of the burn, burn Babylon
Yes indeed, a they did compose a score
That is not the only way they know they for
For now my sugar's gonna know it all
No knowledge of self, won't acknowledge god
Watch how souls observe the law
Judge already told you, the choice is yours
Then get ya crusty feet up off my lawn
The catalogue is all Holocaust
Good day, good day, good day
Peace to all, fear of none
But the one
I've got the chopper right now
Tall sleeves

[Pre-Hook]
Tall sleeves, got the chopper right now
Steppin' razor bully better back down, tall sleeves
Tall sleeves, got the chopper right now
Stepping razor bully better back down, tall sleeves
Tall sleeves, got the chopper right now
Stepping razor bully better back down
Tall sleeves, got the chopper right now
Stepping razor bully better back down
Tall sleeves, got the chopper right now
Stepping razor bully better back down
Tall sleeves, got the chopper right now
Stepping razor bully better back down

[Hook]
Could have been down with the team
Should have been down with the team
Coulda, shoulda bees no honey
This hive is live
Cause you know, you know
Cause you know, you know
Cause you know
Cause you know
Cause you know

[Outro]
Got the chopper right now
Got the chopper right now
Got the chopper right now
Got the chopper right now
Got the chopper right now
Got the chopper right now
Xans, coco popper, proper work
Knock a nigga out in my pajama shirt
Space, do the calender
Paranormal, panorama phenomenons
