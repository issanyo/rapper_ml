[Hook]
It's like a shadow in the dark
You may not see it but you feel it there
It's everywhere and every place
It's planet earth in outer space
It cannot handle all your Ks

[Verse]
And touch the darkness
Not too close, not too far away
Was wild
Heard the news about this the other day
Report, report, report
I should've made some money on it
Crazy
Lookin' real funny don't it?
Standin' in the rear
Circus is packed
Dollars gettin' made
More dollars, more dollars in fact
Better get your vessel
Just my recommendations
Listenin' to the news
We should change stations
You're entitled, you're entitled
Your life, not mine
I'm concerned
But I ain't a guardian over none of these hoes
Doin' my thing
Ain't here for you or against you
All because, show love
It do what it does
Shadow in the dark
A lot of ways to measure presence
A lot of ways to measure essence
Psyche, psychic mind
Deal with it or not
It is what it is
It be what it been

[Hook]
It's like a shadow in the dark
You may not see it but you feel it there
It's everywhere and every place
It's planet earth in outer space
It cannot handle every case
