Quart of oil, gallon of gas
Baby I sure do hope it lasts
Destination: Love
Destination: Love
If I get stuck, give me a shove
Destination: Love

I can't wait to see her smile
Only got about ten more miles
Destination: Love
Destination: Love
If I get stuck, give me a shove
Destination: Love

Well I passed a truck
I passed a bus
I must be doing fine
I'm so close I can almost feel
Her sweet lips on mine

If the front tire blows, I got a spare
If that ones goes I'll still get there

Destination: Love
Destination: Love
If I get stuck, give me a shove
Destination: Love

Destination: Love

Well I crossed a bridge
I climbed a hill
It only steamed up twice
If this old car goes one more mile
I'll be in paradise

She'll be waiting there I know
Left turn, right turn, here I go
Destination: Love
Destination: Love
If I get stuck, give me a shove
Destination: Love
