Yeah, ha, ha, ha
A B boys rock the world
CD's and tapes help generate papes
E-F is the important Def

G-good, H is what style be
When I grab the microphone and MC
Roll off the tongue like L M N O P
And when I am done you will agree

Mos Def represent most definitely
Jesus, what I used to rock it in '83
Drank up all the Kool-Aid at the block party
Used to wish I could break the Rock Steady

Wash this be the brown shoe on TV
But now it's not dis and it's on like this
My name is Mos Def, this is good as it gets
Baby, I make you rub your lips like sardines and grits

My what still hits even when the record skip
Even when the record skip
Even when the record skip
I don't quit, I don't quit
We 'bout to make this one a sure hit
Sean J. make the party people feel it

Ladies and gentlemen, we'd like toduce
A very interesting young man that has traveled
From very far away to be with us tonight

Ha, ha, ha, what uh-huh
There is such a place that creates such a melody Brooklyn
No ladies, it's a living dream
It's a living dream, it's a living dream, love like this

Recognize all area crew
Whether you speak Japanese or goony goo goo
Son, when I come through, other rappers boo-hoo
'Cause they know they style's soft like baby doo-doo

I will continue to hit like a fifth of stolen Naya
Puttin' jokers on ice to get the cream like Breyer
No secret, Mos Def is the one that hunts a Mya
I get in my stance and set the dance on fire
Spread out my wings and I take the world higher

Peace to the fam magnetic in the Chi
Job-on, top Sean and my man Ahtu
And all my other clan who reside in the Zoo
Got a celebrated oatmeal broadcast crew
Mos Def gon' keep it naked like um fu-fu
(Andy)

Put it here to the tape like crazy glue
So when they bounce out of speakers they stick to you
The way that I communicate is non-typical
But high level like a 3-D visual
I hold the mic extensive, exhibit level and dimension
I radiate the space like a up-right bass

Son, I leave crews laced and escape wit no trace
Sound official like the finish time at a horse race
Here to put it in place for the nine-uno-seis
Mos Def set the pace, make your fam give chase
Raise your hands in the air, everybody get wit it

Universal magnetic b-boy, scientific
It's like that and you don't stop
It goes onto the rhythm, you don't stop
Raise your hands in the air, everybody get wit it
The universal magnetic b-boy, scientific y'all
You don't stop, it goes onto the rhythm, bust it

Baby, it's in my chromosomes to rock
Microphones sets who wanna test the M O
Best to leave that nigga alone
I make no bones or poems about droppin' bars
I make the world full swing under the Mos Def, yes

I ring the alarm like tennis sore
My style hella-raw, I keep it raw bone like Skeletor
And you should go and tell your clientele
That they need to get the message like Melle Mel
I got the locked like a Death Row show
And if I ain't a b-boy, premier never used a bell
(Ding, ding)

So tell your boy
(What?)
Crew to retire before I make they
(Ass)
Catch fire like Richard Pryor
Nondescriptive fiendin' for riches, callin' earths
(Bitches)

But most of y'all brothers is livin' with your mothers
Your boogie man yankin' up your covers
Sharper than some new box cutters on Parkay's and butters
And Stevie Wonder's to make you run and tell the others
The beat lovers and play my jam like the numbers
Son, I rock the globe like I rocked your boat
I'm 'bout to tap it on your shoulder 'cause you got to know

Now raise your hands in the air, everybody get wit it
The universal magnetic b-boy, scientific
Like that and you don't stop
It goes onto the rhythm, you don't stop
And raise your hands in the air, everybody get wit it

Universal magnetic b-boy
(Hoo)
Scientific, you don't stop
It goes onto the rhythm, you don't stop
Raise your hands in the air, everybody get wit it

Universal magnetic b-boy, scientific
Like that and you don't stop
It go onto the rhythm, you don't stop
Now raise your hands in the air everybody get wit it
The universal magnetic in a b-boy stance
