(1st Verse)
The wisdom of Voltaire the humor of Colbert
Even on the playground, I was great at four squardes
Get it? sixteens, spit it to get rid of thee
But your dead by the end of the 4th, cedric digory
You make it to six bars, it gets tripled
By the eight bar I ate your bars, like a snickers
Mhmm, satisfaction
Multiply your girls bottoms, now she’s my fraction
Yo in fact this rap is mathematics
My flow mean; its savage, your flow means, it’s average
Between the 9th and 11th, I know you’re fearing me
But by the 12th you write it off as a conspiracy
13 bars I bar mitzvah rappers
I write a passage to ruin your rite of passage
If you make it to 16, you must have earned it
But you got no drive, ain't even got a permit
By the 18th you’re a man, but whoa dude
Youv’e got hooka bars, I can legally smoke you
You reach 21, no more juvenile bars
The Truth is I can let you into my bars

The one day in frisco where the fog cleared
Me and chaz rolled through and they all cheered
So wise fuck around and grow a long beard
Throw out the marks, ya’ll get dog eared
Our mission is to split em with lyricism rid em from mental prison give lenses for better vision
I’m Ending this bitter schism, injecting my criticism, tryna diagnose wack, it comes in limitless prisms
See for two easy payments of 3.99
You can trade your soul for a chain that don’t shine
We’ll throw in some hoes for a couple more bucks
Side effects include being wack as fuck
Tell em bout the weed spot when you popped three shots
And don’t tell em you ever were a police cop
You can cop a techno beat that sounds so hollow
And tell us how you dance like the world ends tomorrow
You can brag, semi-colon and a simile
Like I’m the bomb bitch; Middle East
Tell us bout the burden of being a star
How your emotionally scarred, cop a hook from Bruno Mars
Tell us how your rich, and you love to buy things
So soft probably repair a butterflies wing
Try to shock me into buying it with horrorcore
But if its horrible, I’ll say aravuah
You can scream how your starting a movement
Or you can focus your opus and notice the music
We bridge the gap between rap and poetry
Even make a Kesha fan say OMG
Hard to listen, the majority’s conformity
I’m just curious, what’s your priority?
