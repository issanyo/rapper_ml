Heh, y'all just payin' rent, see I'm sayin'? {Oh oh oh oh oh, Oh oh oh oh oh}

[Verse 1]
Listen, now honey check it out ya got me mesmerized
With your black hair and your fat ass thighs
It's the way I hold it down to make my nature rise
You got me in the boutiques pickin' out your size
You make the push and I can't get it out my mind
It's that body I can't get it out my mind
Give it up ma, know it that you're down to ride
Hit the dance floor and bounce your hide
You got to bounce with mine
And let me know when your down to slide
I tell Ad to swing around to ride
Let's show you how I grind
I make it splash like a thousand times
I'm like the stars fallin out the sky, Big Mos
Flaco make your waist get coast
Make your green get smoke
Make your cat get stroke
Me and Pha make the track get dope
We stay settin' pace in the race now let's go
