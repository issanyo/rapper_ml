Listen man, this special

Roll together with the waves
The lights in heaven and the holy host
Bright eyes in the shade
Warm blooded, turn the candle low
Sometimes you look so strange
So sweet I don't know what to do
I don't always understand
But come close to the feeling true
And no it ain't no lie
I don't need no lie

Let me turn down all the screams
Forever ever's in the holy ghost
You say it sounds so strange
Turn it up, let me listen low
I want it all so hard
Terrified it might disappear
But if it all end tomorrow
We got to love each other inevitably
And baby this no like
Ya know it ain't no lie

Roll together with the waves
The lights in heaven and the holy ghost
I feel you stroll through your shape
I feel it dawn, make my mind explode
Sometimes your love's so wild
I swear to God, don't know what to do
Oh baby make me feel free
We somewhere way past comfortable
And baby that's no lie
I don't need no

I don't need no lie
I ain't wastin' my time
I wanna feel so high
