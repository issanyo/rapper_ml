Gravity..
Uh..ha..ha..ha..ha

Yeah, gravity is all around
Gravity get up or gravity get down
Some heads wanna escape but don't try
You contempt to get fly but you can't defy
And just when you thought you strayed far away
Here comes gravity to save the day
Here comes gravity to save the day
Here comes gravity, gravity...

Gravity...you know it make me
Think about the space program and...
NASA and all that, know what I'm sayin'
An think he got some place
In space, he do!
It's called Earth
We better off just...
Holdin' down this little square that God gave us
Instead of tryin' to...
Question the unquestionable
You try to claim the unknown
The unknown claim you...
Gravity is what we
Must submit to

[Hook]

New Negro definition:
Gravity is your mother's hand
Gravity is your father's voice
Gravity is your baby's heartbeat in his sleep
Gravity is visiting you birthplace
Divine is your race
Gravity is... tender memories of hard times
Gravity put the letters together in my rhyme
Gravity... is all around
Gravity... make we all get down, check it...

Gravity is all around
Gravity get up, gravity get down
Some heads wanna escape but don't try
You contempt to get fly but you can't defy
Just when you thought you strayed far away
Here comes gravity to save the day
Man compared to gravity, son we all jack new
