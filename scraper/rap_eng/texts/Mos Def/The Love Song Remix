(Lee Majors)
This is....a Bush Babee... Exclusive ya'll
De La, Bush Babees, yeah, yeah, check it!

(Mos Def)
Comin' wit it, comin' wit it
Comin', comin', comin', comin' 'wit it
I been all around the world and back again
All I want is piece of mind
I been all around the world and back again
All I want is piece of mind
Love, love, and we don't stop!
Love, love everybody!
Love, love!  Love! Love!  Love!
Please, everybody

(Lee Majors)
Hip hop's last desciple
Your rhymes are tampered wit' like the bible
My ill recitle, marks the genesis
The nemesis flows malicious
On Schindlers lists's with astericks's
The ficticious, I get suspicious.  He's born vicious
For the list'ners.....I'm complex
R&B singers love to show off they bird chest
Shirtless, and worthless
Respect a truer living
My tax dollars run your whole filthy religion
It gets sick when I catch 'em slippin'
They frontin' hard.  Bring your crew son
Laced up wit' words from god
It's Lee Major!
I snatch the earth, and make the world believe
C'mon now!
Ya'll  fuckin' with these super MC's.  So please
David Merse, I'll make your crew disperse
Word is born.  Pot holes, I'll stomp a cannon in your lawn
Sing along!  It's that same old song
You ain't tough to step up
In native toungues I'll have to call that bluff

(Dove)
Ay yo!
Straight out the laboratory
'Got a bag of stories, for you fairy tale niggas
I excersize this love into the fine figures
We cuttin heads like the scissors
Excuse me mista tally-man come tally up these digits
Secure it like we live it
No need to play it minor
Up on you like your favorite designer
]From here to ocean liner..
I can please it cooler than cooley.  Ya mooley!
Ya foolin' yourself.  Only dependin' on wealth
See you can shake it salt n' pep', but I can't taste your spice
You got the evil all up in you like dice
I keep the vision pricise
And send these critters out to Candy, Calcutta
Fuck the butter!  See we make the persona
And our kids lovin' out the solar galac'
So pull the rope for no slack
This second shot is to my man pharoah track
Out of the seven-eighteen
We meet the fifty-one-six on all sides
And touch grounds to marinade with the five
Check it out!

(Mos Def)
I been all around the world and back again
All I want is piece of mind
I been all around the world and back again
All I want is piece of mind
Love, love, and we don't stop!
Love, love everybody!
Love, love!  Love! Love!  Love!
Please, everybody

(Posdnous)
Yes ya'll
Well I shall....proceed,....and continue....to make you bleed
It's the anthem of the evil that knows your creed
That's why I made sure to inform my seed
That if the world looks scary, it's because it is
Filled with scary young niggas takin' yours, and his
And hers.  Send a sign, helps to get this heard
Worldwide it's hard to send
I'll be the former fifty-two man
Over-standing color and demeanor
On the browns of L.I. Sound
To the greens of Medina
Where DCQ an' two, we holdin' down fort
We got a quart of love stationed in the wagon. Right
Drinkin' an' braggin'
Some puffin' wear they outfit pants saggin'
Rhymes tight, I got another lighter to burn
Lessons learned
Coast to coast!
I pass to mighty Mos Def

(Mos Def)
North, south, to the east to west
Well I don't know what I been told
But nowaday you can't believe everything that you hear
Skeezoids, tabloid like "A Current Affair"
Objects in the mirror closer than they appear
Sometimes the world feel like it's a real cartoon
I woke up in fresh air just to comsume bus fumes
Niggas screamin' 'bout they cream that they tryin' to get
The same issh different day, is still the same issh
Whenever el's get lit, man your focus get split
And then you start seein' double an' get caught in the bubble
Pop music is what rap get confused wit'
Same hand you play to win be the hand you lose wit'
Who's this?  It's the mighty Mos Def yall
To make you raise your hand high an' say yes yall
This ain't no stale fairy tale it's funk-fresh yall
Accent the nerve wit' my verb.  Like, Yes pa!

I been all around the world and back again
All I want is piece of mind
I been all around the world and back again
All I want is piece of mind
Love, love, and we don't stop!
Love, love everybody!
Love, love!  Love! Love!  Love!
Please, everybody

(Mr. Man)
I been around your sun twenty-two times and still counting
Still rolling
I got that shit to keep your whole planet bouncin'-
Bounce -off it's axis.  Relax cause the fact is spreaden'
Rap till the ends I'm deaden'
Wit' the illest ryhme heard this side of the sun
My man walks around the planet makin' money, havin' fun
I walk around the earth makin' these rappers piss they pants
Cuz' finance without substance is a nuisance
See nowadays the pen is mightier than the sword
So even when my style is free, you can't afford-
-to have stepped.  I dash your whole rep to pieces
I used to pray to Jesus
But I found too many creases in that thesis
So now it's the Elo on the war path
As long as light shines I still be droppin' more math-
-than kids in college, who couldn't handle the preesure
So spread the news around town like Sarah Lee Kesler
Word!
