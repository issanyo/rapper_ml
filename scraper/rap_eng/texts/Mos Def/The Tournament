[Intro]
Power influence prestige control
Guess right now we'll start the show
(all right)

[Verse 1]
They making they plans, dusting they guns off
And wondering, what I need to do to be boss?
Or who I need to fight?
Or who I need to kill?
Or push back on the climb to the top of the thrill?
Its a tournament with so many players
A system with too many layers
A pyramid with a few at the top
Plenty at the base here to nature the race
The closer that you get to the top, its small space
But the further you move in the heights, its less safe
But the views are amazing
And when you moving on up, its pure praises
And if you fall off, bloody spectacle
Coliseum sound wave, the roar is incredible
And the risk is immeasurable
But for top shot the danger's acceptable
You too could be the Don
Bright gems on your limb pretty hens on your arm
Respect at any threshold that you step across
The life of the charm
The hammer and the gods
Never-mind the house, run your own odds
Jump in to swim never mind the sharks
They on the payroll
They teeth don't show unless you say so
Here's to the fruits of your labor
So ripe and full with flavor
Here's to the dream fulfilled
To the fantastic being real
To the stars in the hills
To the power of the will

Everyday is like your birthday
Everyday is like your birthday
Every time is like the first time
Every walk is a parade

Total control
(Enjoy)
(Experience)

Everyday is like your birthday
Everyday is like your birthday
Every time is like the first time
Every walk is a parade

Total control
