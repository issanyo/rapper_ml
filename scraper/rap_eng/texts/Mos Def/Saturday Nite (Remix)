[Mos Def:]
Can't mistake it
This is a style that ain't for no faking
If you're out there player hating
You really need to be celebrating
This is the way we get down, say yeah
Go ladies, don't break it
Just shake it, just shake it
That's what I like, that's what I like

[Verse 1: Carleen Anderson]
All she does is try to make ends meet
Living day to day economy
Holding strong to all her dignity
Lady luck always takes a back seat
She said

[Chorus:]
Saturday night, saturday night
One night can make it better
Saturday night, we can all be free
Picking up the pieces
Ready to start a new day

[Mos Def:]
Yeah, baby, that's what I like
Yeah, baby, that's what I like
Just do that dance
Yeah, darling, that's what I like
Word to mutha, that's what I like
Just sway your thing
Yeah, baby, that's what I like
Yeah, baby, that's what I like
Just do that dance
Yeah, baby, that's what I like
Yeah, baby, that's what I like

[Verse 2:]
Two kids in the back room
Where they're all sleeping in the same bed
Daddy up and left them
While mama baked them bread

[Chorus:]
Saturday night, saturday night
One night can make it better
Saturday night, we can all be free
Said she longs to
Go somewhere they won't be staring at me

[Rap: Mos Def]
Midnight, can't sit still
I'm on the horn, "yo, fam, what the deal?"
Say the Heavies, "Throwing down an affair."
Say the world, "Where it at? Send 'em there."
I got to get on prepared
Check the closet for the kicks and the wear
With some oil for my nappy ass hair
Give me a shout when you get downstairs
Beep beep! Move back the seats in your Jeep
New York, no, Brooklyn don't sleep
Hit the strip, put the whip on creep
Roll down, got the bass on deep
I ain't tricking, but I got all the treats
Jay Dee beats keep the streets on heat
Honey love peep it out like a camera
Double parked on the ave and she askin' ya:
"Swing down and let me ride?"
But not every pretty face is allowed inside
The night buzzing and it's dozens of dimes
But some of y'all ain't worth the stress and time
"I want love," singing sad songs
Pharcyde pass on, mash on
The next stop is the spot, heads flock
Got the key to the city
And you can't pick my lock
The DJ make them say don't stop
And New York is red hot
Honey grab my hand and wanna fox trot
Later on, body rock, for now I'mma watch like
Yeah, baby, that's what I like
Yeah, baby, that's what I like
Just do that dance
Yeah, darling, that's what I like
Word to mutha, that's what I like
Just sway your thing
Yeah, baby, that's what I like
Yeah, baby, that's what I like
Just do that dance
Yeah, darling, that's what I like
Just do your thing, just sway your thing
Just shake it, don't break it
Go ladies, don't break it
Just shake it, don't break it
Go ladies, I can't take it
Just shake it, don't break it
Go ladies, don't break it

[Vamp:]
Look good on a Saturday
Feel good on a Saturday
Look good on a Saturday
Feel good on a Saturday
Look good on a Saturday
Look good
