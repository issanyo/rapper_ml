One thing I want to assure them
If they think I'm gonna change or compromise
My attitude and my way of life or
In my expression or in my goal
Towards politics
They are making me stronger
And I am much much stronger now

Check a blank to the boogie
And upchuck a boogie
To the rhythym of the boogie to be
To the rhythym of the boogie to be

There it go like simple and plainest primal and basic
Zulu arrangement rockin' amazement
Flaco, radiating from heaven to pavement
They phony as a facelift and nothing to play with
Spent time hating but that ain't changing it
God give it to me, nobody is takin' it
Therefore, moving on the base of stimulus
Standing in the twilight and watching them get it in
The walls are trembling, the air, simmering
She movin' like more than her ears are listenin'
Whoah now
Testin' your equilibrium
Sonic wave booming all over your intimate
Skin on skin
And skin on skin again
Put it all, get it all, get on, get it then
Ladies and gentlemen, misters and mistresses
Cousins, uncle, auntie and synonym
There it is, boogieman

Ha
Simmer down simmer down simmer down now
Simmer down now
Simmer down now
Simmer down now
Quiet dog, bite hard, my God

So and the rocking don't stop
Brooklyn in the kitchen heat up the stovetop
Banging the Empire State and navigating the way
Your preservation make the greatest hip hop
They cool dude swagger look terribly corny
The flow so petty, unsteady, it's boring
These dudes ain't though, but they yawning

They need to get off it
So whack whack is all you can call it
Therefore, moving on and deaf to stimulus
Regardless what zone or what town you represent
A bulletin to all of your settlements
Tower to tenement
I mold you from all of the elements
Now simmer down and manage your mayhem
I'm bright as the A.M
And you're rock and roll out the station
And blessed with the fresh from day one
I got it today done
We all going back to the same one
This constant motivation I'll stay with
Remarkable flavors
That all bear the mark of the greatness

Whoah now
The kid is from Buck Town
Your girl is in love now
You chumps gonna front and get shut down
Shut

Simmer down simmer down simmer down now
Simmer down now
Simmer down now
Simmer down now
Quiet dog bite hard, let's rock

And you don't stop
See you rock to the rhythm we don't stop
So you maintain the rock and you don't stop
You keep up the rock and you don't stop
Maintain the rock and you don't stop
You keep up the rock and you don't stop
Maintain the rock and you don't stop

You keep up the rock
Quiet dog bite hard, my God
