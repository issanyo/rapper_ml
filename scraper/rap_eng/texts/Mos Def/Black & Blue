[Mos Def]
You don't like me huh? thats aight I like me
I got somethin to say to you

I see you standin on the side wit your smile and your crooked eyes
Acting like a man but a chick frontin in disguise
Open on some thicker thighs, smokin on a blunt of lies
Tradin in a badge for a sash sayin sucker hi
Lookin at her son now, probably make a mother cry
Should of listened to that song tellin' you to "Walk on by"
But you didn't now your washed up like a cup of tide
Let me know I got the heat when you think it's time to dry

[Mekhi Phifer]
What you think you talkin 'bout mistake me for some other guy
Need to buy a watch cause ain't no shorty gonna give the time
Day or night birthdays, Kwanzas or Valentines
Big talk, really small but you ain't a friend of mine
You ain't even genuwine sweeter than a Cinnabon
[Mos Def]
But wit five fingers and a fist I'm deadly as the Pentagon
You don't want beef with MILLER cuz I'm ILLER
[Mekhi Phifer]
Or because you bout as criminal as killers
[Mos Def]
Whoa how, I see you slick with the words now
Gassed cause you got a chick with some curves now
Calm your nerves down you was locked Carmen Brown
Draws had hers down scored on the first down
Yeah, so get the keys out your purse now
Run to your car fore' you're laying in a hearse clown
[Mekhi Phifer]
How you sound yo you dirtier than Jers now
Extortin all that money thought you'd have a couple furs now
[Mos Def]
Ha, watch ya speed I don't wanna play around
You got your head in the clouds I'm bout to bring it to the ground
It's somethin that you need to know
[Mekhi Phifer]
They got you on video?
[Mos Def]
Sike but your girl Carmen Brown is a silly ho
