[Verse 1]
Bismillah
Fresh dates, warm plates
What's great, alhamdulilah, life is great
The night prowl, feel it in the night air
Fresh rain fall, it's the right air
The waves right here
We experience tests today
Above all, we got blessed today
Same as every day
In a special way

[Hook]
The 99, 9999
99999
Local time
99, 9999
99999
The local time is now
Whoever you are, no matter, no how
The moon and the waves, the breeze and the clouds
Wherever you are, the local time is
99, 9999
99999
Ask the master
99, 9999
99999
No greater love

[Bridge]
Say you love it
No one will let you go
Can't run from it
No other place to go
Say you love it
No one will let you go
Can't run from it
No other place to go
Say you love it
No one will let you go
Can't run from it
No other place to go
Say you love it
No one will let you go
Can't run from it
No other place to go

[Hook]
The 99, 9999
