[Verse 1]
I'm ready, ready for action
Intimate swift like a cash transaction
Speaker blows out from row house to the mansion
This ghetto sound rap, an arousal of passion
They don't know the language, but shoutin' the anthem
The beat translated make the world understand some
My voice like magic, my flow fantastic
In summary I'm rare, ordinary, elaborate
But check the profile, this is lyrically handsome
Resembles my pay scale, slim nigga, ain't frail
And I ain't in the gym on some Ebony man shit
I'm in the laboratory, bench pressin' the standard
It's your hand, I'm liftin' the bar [?]
Get close to the Gods, stay focused and sharp
It's High stakes and there's way more than paper involved
You must evolve or die, that ain't falsified
Home team I know you keep trouble on your mind
Don't let bullshit knock you off your grind
And that's real talk for all of mine and for all of yours
I rock steady, keep your bounce of course
I'm low key, cool breeze, man I'm 'bout my balls
Tap tap, knock down your door
Tap tap and break down the wall, collect and count it all
And like "Bang" in the air, I'm gone
See I'm ridin' on, keep cool, you can ride along
But keep it up, you won't ride for long
And that's word to God, BK show me where you are
Word to Lord we the brightest stars

[Chorus]
And this the hottest thing
I make 'em get involved
Yes yes y'all, free free y'all
I feel free y'all, and you don't stop
Yes yes y'all, free free y'all
I feel free y'all, and you don't stop
Yes yes y'all, free free y'all
I feel free y'all, and you don't stop

[Verse 2]
It’s like, get your mind right ‘te is the twilight
I'm Strong in the limelight, sharper than hindsight
Cherokee [?] see through the hype hype
Blow up the sights like they [?]
Blow valley survivor, rider or driver
The engine [?] sees the victory in street
Gettin' that dolo when we gettin' that [?]
The most powerful culture's on coast and it's skin deep
Who hear me? Put Simply
I Kill confusion and build your movement
Skill and the will to do [?]Undeniable proven
Magnetic contributions
We all know around and behind the music
Black dons constitution
Straight ahead and elusive, black Dons, they exclusive
So let's do this

[Chorus]
Yes yes y'all, free free y'all
I feel free y'all, and you don't stop
Yes yes y'all, free free y'all
I feel free y'all, and you don't stop
Yes yes y'all, free free y'all
I feel free y'all, and you don't stop
Yes yes y'all, free free y'all
I feel free y'all, and you don't stop

[Verse 3]
I'm ready, ready for action
Intimate swift like a cash transaction
Speaker blows out from row house to the mansion
This ghetto sound rap, an arousal of passion
They don't know the language, but shoutin' the anthem
The beat translated make the world understand some
My voice like magic, my flow fantastic
In summary I'm rare, ordinary, elaborate
But check the profile, this is lyrically handsome
Resembles my pay scale, slim nigga, ain't frail
And I ain't in the gym on some Ebony man shit
I'm in the laboratory, bench pressin' the standard
It's your hand, I'm liftin' the bar [?]
Get close to the Gods, stay focused and sharp
It's High stakes and there's way more than paper involved
You must evolve or die, that ain't falsified

See I'm ridin' on, keep cool, you can ride along
But keep it up, you won't ride for long
And that's word to God, BK show me where you are
The coolest thing and the brightest star
