Freedom is everybody's job
We got work to do
Ride with me
Vibe with me
Freedom is everybody's job

You see, my swing is super ghetto
Like a Cutlass Supreme
And when I'm comin' up your strip
Baby, I'm something to see
I got my bass on thunner
Sittin' on twenties
Your baby mama love me
And homie, it's no wonder
Now when I'm in the east
Them babies know my name
When I'm ridin' on the west
Them babies know the same
But when I'm up top, you know I can't stop
And when I'm in the dirty dirty
I get it twerkin' workin'
My swing is super ghetto
Like a Cutlass Supreme
A velvet headrest with a couple of screens
And if you want something funky
Then you want it from me
And if you want something ugly
You don't want it from me
See, I could put it there
However niggas want it to be
I keep the proof right here
If you don't want to believe
Keep game in my vein
Fuck up the sleeve
You just fuckin' with yourself
Out here fuckin' with me

I said, uh
You get in, get in where you
You fit in, fit in and we
We ride and ride and how we
We like it, like it
I said, uh
You get in, get in where you
You fit in, fit in and we
We ride and ride and how we
We like it, like it, said uh

Hear some folks say
Man, what you do that for
What a nigga look like
With some rock guitars
Some cats say
Homie, what you do that for
What a nigga look like
Bloopdy bloopdy blah blah
I throw the mojo finger high
For my folk to relate
But in the back, I can hear
Every fucker that hate
Wait, tryin' to concentrate
Y'all gonna have to wait
Set a rain date
Matter fact
I'm playing golf with Don Cornelius
On the moon, I won't be back soon
I reign from June to June
MD, JD, how we do
Definition, Preservation, beautiful
For me and mines
Yours and you
Ride with me, got work to do
We got work to do
Ride with me now
We got work to do, we got work to do
Freedom is everybody's job, now
And my work so beautiful
That corner there, that corner there
That star on top, that star below
Everywhere we go
