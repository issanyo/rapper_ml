Thanks
All thanks and praises are due to Allah, the lord of the worlds, the master of judgement, the architect of creation, the ruler of mankind. The eternal, the irresistible, who is without peer or opponent. There is no-one who resembles him and he is capable of what he wills. The most righteous of us cannot add an iota to his kingdom and the most wicked of us cannot take anything from it. We have no escape from you but to seek refuge in you. I thank you for my parents. They are my guidance, protection, and the best friends I will ever have. May Allah give you mansions in paradise. Amin! Thank you for my children who opened up my heart to things that the english language is too weak to describe. My family the Smiths, the Tolers and the powerful Indian Marys who lead both. Elders for council, young men for war... gunready. To the believers all over the world may Allah soften our hearts where they are hardened, strengthen them where they are weak, show us the middle course and grant us light in this world and the next. Amin. Whoever hears this and hears good know that it's from Allah. Whoever hears this and hears bad know that it is from me and my own shortcomings, and for this I ask Allah and people to forgive me. Thank you for spending your money and most importantly your time to listen. Insha Allah. It is a benefit to you. This Album is dedicated to Assata, Mutulu Shakur, Fred Hampton Jr., Mumia Abu Jamal, Russell Choats, Sundiata Acoll, and all those who have lived and died in the pursuit of justice and freedom. Free the land! Last but not least, I'd like to thank all the producers for their talent, their patience, and their input on this project. God bless. Special thanks to Weldon Irvine for everything. I'm glad that I know you. When I grow up I hope I'm like you. For all the Rawkus staff, for their energy, efforts, and time. And all the staff at Sony, Chung King, and every other studio that has experienced the displeasure of my company in the last year. Thanks. God bless
