Peace...Peace, Peace
It's the Bey
Thank you very kindly, Masha'Allah
You could have been anywhere in the world, but you're here with us
We truly appreciate that

[Verse: Mos Def]
Bey...
This is the way it is, this how we gotta live
It's peace, power, overstanding; no cowardice
I got the sharps on, they keep the smarts on
Custom fitted, surgeon throwing the dark song
Good lordy, sweet Jesus and hot sauce
Hot butter, the big angles and pop corn
The over-range, the top on the top gone
The underground, the top dog and airborne
The crescent and the star
The seven inner R's
Sciences and all
Vibrant in the dark
At the speed of thought, wow
The mind's so powerful
It ain't long fore' your dreams is surrounding you
Caution caution, careful careful
A whole lot of fun but it ain't that simple
The mathematic, asiatic, black magic, rap captains stay active free captives
Baby what's happening?
Listen, life is fantastic
Beautiful and tragic
Plain, classic
Long as I'm alive I'mma never stop rapping
It's honest work for honest bastards
Made in Manhattan, raised outta Brooklyn
It ain't shit that you can do but keep looking
Shook, cause they all crooks
My hands keep clean even off the books, see yo
This is the way it is, this how we gotta live
It's peace power over standing no cowardice
I got the sharks on, they keep the sharks off
Custom-fitted, surgeon throwing the smart song
It's Good lordy, sweet Jesus and hot sauce
The hot butter, the big screens and pop corn
The over-ranged, the top gone, the top jaw
The underground the top dog, airborne
The crescent and the star
The seven inner R's
Sciences and all
Vibrant in the dark
At the speed of thought, wow
It's so powerful
It was all a dream, now it's a surrounding view
Caution Caution, Careful Careful
