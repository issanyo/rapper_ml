(Keep slipping
Time keep slipping)

LEE MAJORS:
Yo, the only thing Majors don't waste is time in bed
My timing is rare, take time, time to prepare
No time for fear, how many times I said it this year?
What time ya going to realize: The time is near
Call a time out! Scritti Politti Major climbed out
The cracks of the streets waste no time on beats
Mos Def, mos definitely, the rap chief
The new release, time to make cream, time to take a piece

And at the same time, time to build, time is rilla
I swear I bring the heat to tracks like Val Kilmer
You know that time waits for no man, in time you'll see
That you're wasting all your time while you watchin' TV
And yo Scritti, I'm on it like walls to graffiti
From night sticks to plunges to N.Y.P.D
From Lucille to B.B. King you see me rhyme (what)
You stay away from drama if it's just wasting your time

HOOK: LEE MAJORS (GREEN GARTSIDE)
Time tables keep turning (From tinseltown)
You've got the both ends burning up (To the boogiedown)
Time-time keeps slipping (They play for time)
(And work for spaces)

Time tables keep turning (And clocks are wound)
You've got the both ends burning up  (And worked around)
Time-time keeps slipping (And in their prime)
(They change their faces)

MOS DEF:
Yeah, from boogiedown to tinseltown, I had 'em all gettin' down
My baggage claim's got exotic names, I get around
How I'm living now well that's a whole lot different now
From where I'm sittin' at I got a whole clearer vision now
I play the tables hard, wild cards I was flipping down
My partners hitting pounds somewhere off in prison now
I'm flipping out, things switch and change so suddenly
The way you act today is tomorrow's where you wanna be

Your company shift when you start livin' comfortably
The spotlight switch and then you dip right from under me
Don't front with me, I want to be perfectly clear
Time is here I'm keeping yesterday in the rear
A current affair Mos Def and Lee Majors appear
'Bout to write this little diddy with that Scritti you hear
And it's about that time so if you could damn would you?
Sit back and look at who time's been good to

LEE MAJORS:
Now one time I thought I had it all
Mass of broads, flash awards, cash cards
Time's a double-edged sword
One day you hear applause next day when you leave
You catch an L in the C like Christopher Reeves
But y'all believe that this cats threw dirt on my name?
Give 'em time, they couldn't win if I gave them point game
At time I used to swerve now I'm learning my lane
Trapped in time what a shame with nobody to blame

MOS DEF:
It waits for no one, the fats and slow ones, the rich the no funs
Samurais and Showgirls, the first drinking noras [not possible]
Hey Yoda, you better hop to it or you blow son
'Cuz time keep slipping, make no difference if you don't come
It's beeing well recorded how we sported that advice, we-
Get our game and do our thing and spend these moments wisely
It's time to make chase, get face, no time to waste
First you on, then you gone, so long, you've been replaced

HOOK: LEE MAJORS (GREEN GARTSIDE)
Time tables keep turning (From cali high)
You've got the both ends burning up (To the do-or-die)
Time-time keeps slipping (They set their heart)
(And fix their courses)

Time tables keep turning (And dreams are dreams)
You've got the both ends burning up  (of how we see)
Time-time keeps slipping (They steel themselves)
(They are ressources)

Time tables keep turning (From tinseltown)
You've got the both ends burning up (To the boogiedown)
Time-time keeps slipping (They play for time)
(And work for spaces)

Time tables keep turning (And clocks are wound)
You've got the both ends burning up  (And worked around)
Time-time keeps slipping (And in their prime)
