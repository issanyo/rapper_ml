[Intro]
Peace, this is Yasiin

[Hook]
No more parties in SA
Please, tell 'em no more parties in SA

[Verse 1]
Ain't home arrest, I don't need to stay
I'll leave and I'll stay away
I committed no crime any place
Why these police up in my face?
Why they raiding my place?
Why I don't feel safe?
This is not an expression of fear
This is just to make things clear
My intentions are pure in coming here
And that's for everything I love or hold dear
Umi's in the building
So is my wife and my children
I committed no crime
Why is the state wasting my time?
They must be out of their minds
I forgive 'em, that's the spirit of divine
I just wanna go where I'm wanted
Where I'm loved, stop frontin'
Where I live is my choice, you cannot mute my voice
Thank you, Kanye West, for being a real friend, a real friend
A real friend

[Hook]
No more parties in SA
Please, no more parties in SA

[Verse 2]
I heard your choice the first time, I'll go away
And when I leave, that's exactly where I'll stay
This is not an expression of fear
This is just to make things clear
A country called Earth, everywhere
A country called Earth, everywhere

[Hook]
No more parties in SA
Please, no more parties in SA
