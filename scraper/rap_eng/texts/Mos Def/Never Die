[Hook]
I got to feel the sunshine
I got to feel the thoughts of your mind on mine
Then I’ll never die
Beneath the darkened sky

[Verse 1: Eric Biddines]
Excuse my babble, I talk until I got lengthy
Certain topics get the best of my interest don't mean I'm friendly
Running like a leaky faucet
See we toss it to the side throw it in the closet
Very rare for me to lose my cool
We in a school full of stools
Sitting at a table dissecting these facts like they ain't true
Who told you you can get away with telling these lies?
Before you swallow oxygen look me in the eyes
Reflection in the mirror we don't recognize it
Paint a canvas in my image
Put a frame around it
Don't even hang it cause I'm looking like
This supposed to be me?
Analyzing every logistic how can I fix it?
Changing everything but what I need help with
See now I'm trippin’
Now I'm fishing for a crack in the ceiling so I can ditch it
Rules golden like the mouth that I speak with to bite the tension
Count on me to let you down cause that's realistic. Rules

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Yasiin Bey]
They say the chief of the tribe took a handsome bribe
Now his face is everywhere but he's hard to find
Super prime, on the grind, in the modern times
Gains from the game in exchange for a sober mind
And young’un you can hug the block, but it won't hug back
Until it do, and it squeeze and your spine go snap
Like feet chasing paper then his lungs just collapse
Ain't no freedom at the trap, it’s as simple as that
Pay a hater no mind, because that don't matter
Why whip slaves when you can just kill master?
Slaves getting brave to guard masters’ interests
They too shall feel it once we snap the clip in
So no threats only oaths, get well or catch hell
Shop open get dosed, medina hours baby, we never close
And how ever the banks go this balance don't broke
Salaam folks

[Hook]
