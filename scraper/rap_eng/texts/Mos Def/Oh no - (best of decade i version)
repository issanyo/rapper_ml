Ya, one for the treble, two for the bass
Welcome to the great incredible paper chase
Keep your boots laced if you want to keep pace
Oh no, niggas ain't scared to hustle
It's been seven days, the same clothes
Ask them originals 'cause they know
Mos Def, Nate Dogg, and Pharoahe
Step away from the mic, they too cold
The funk might fracture your nose
Say my name, say my name
Observe how I stake my claim
I independently layed down and played my game
My own two raise my flame
'Cause dick ridin' ain't my thing
I earned what they said I wouldn't
I got it the way they said I couldn't
But now I'm gettin' it and their whole grill is cookin'
Mad, 'cause I'm gettin' caked out from my bookings
When y'all was askin' permission I just stepped up and took it
What? The kid's better buy my rookie card now
'Cause after this year the price ain't comin' down
And if you got a joint bubblin', then get money now
'Cause in a minute there's gon' be some real trouble comin' out
Just a warnin', as usual, some cats won't heed it
The hard headed always gotta feel it to believe it
It's a shame that jealous gays is too short to see it
But when their face hit the cement, they nod in agreement
We could play nice and decent or dirty like the 7-1 precinct
Call it a day or make it a long evenin'
You keep on schemin', makin' me some more reasons
I had the women in your mama's church screamin', "Lord Jesus"
Harder than y'all 'cause I'm smarter than y'all
I know that deep down it got to be botherin' y'all
Pay attention, watch fly gon' get larger than y'all
Put your pride on the rocks, make you swallow it all
Oh no, look at who they let in the back door
From Long Beach to Brooklyn they know
We rock from the east to west coast
Queens to Step away from the mic they too cold
The funk might fracture your nose
Very contagious raps should be trapped in cages
Through stages and wackness, foul rats is blazin'
And it amazes me how you claim thug
But go two ways without Skytell pagers
I'm intellectual, pass more essays
Than motorcade police parades through East L.A
More beef then deli's plus what I vent is just
What you must defend is evil aim, uh
Hallelujah, Pharoahe Monch'll tool ya
Maintain the same frame of mind, school ya
Get the picture, sit ya, seat ya, preacher with scriptures
I'ma quit the rip ya, reach ya
Pharoahe and Mos is verbalized, Mos is coast to coast
We boast to be the most explosive here
Ferocious, the lyrical prognosis
The dose is just leavin' you mentally unfocused here
Emcee's just come on 'round
You're the next contestants on, 'Catch a beat down'
Don't be hesitant, sound cracks to sediment
It's evident we're medicine for your whole town
Sky's the limit, game's definite when I'm in it
All window's is tinted, how you seein' me when I'm in it?
Rap, we got it on lock man, stop that
Put that mic back down, boy, drop that
Pharoahe's, slows, blows, shows, like Afros
We hate y'all though, that's why Nate Dogg goes
Oh no, niggas ain't scare to hustle
It's been seven days the same clothes
Ask them originals 'cause they know
Mos Def, Nate Dogg and Pharoahe
Step away from the mic they too cold
The funk might fracture your nose
Oh no, niggas ain't scare to hustle
It's been seven days the same clothes
Ask them originals 'cause they know
Mos Def, Nate Dogg and Pharoahe
Step away from the mic they too cold
The funk might fracture your nose
Oh no, look at who they let in the back door
From Long Beach to Brooklyn they know
We rock from the east to west coast
Queens to Step away from the mic they too cold
The funk might fracture your nose
