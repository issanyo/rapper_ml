As I got on a city bus and found a vacant seat
I thought I saw my future bride walking up the street
I shouted to the driver, "Hey conductor, you must slow down
I think I see her, please let me off this bus"

Nadine, honey, is that you?
Oh, Nadine, honey, is that you?
Seems like every time I see you
Darling you got something else to do

I saw her from the corner when she turned and doubled back
And started walkin' toward a coffee colored Cadillac
I was pushin' through the crowd tryin' to get to where she's at
I was campaign shouting like a southern diplomat

Nadine, honey, is that you?
Oh, Nadine, honey, where are you?
Seems like every time I catch up with you
You're up to something new

Downtown searching for her looking all around
Saw her getting in a yellow cab heading up town
I caught a loaded taxi, paid up everybody's tab
With a twenty dollar bill told him, "Catch that yellow cab"

Nadine, honey, is that you?
Oh, Nadine, honey, is that you?
Seems like every time I catch up with you
You're up to something new

She moves around like a wave of summer breeze
Go, driver, go, go, catch her for me please
Moving through the traffic like a mounted cavalier
Leaning out the taxi window trying to make her hear

Nadine, honey, is that you?
Oh, Nadine, honey, is that you?
Seems like every time I see you
Darling you're up to something new
