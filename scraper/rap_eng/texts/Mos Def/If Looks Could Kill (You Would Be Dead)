[Beyonce]
Sweetness flowing like a faucet, body bangin' no corset
Brother's wanna toss it but they lost cause my game made em forfeit
Slicker than a porpoise and thicker than a horse's
Carmen Brown got the whole town speechless
I stick to my thesis, eyes stick to my features
Brother's try to hold but they game never reaches
And most of these cats are like the middle of peaches
I see you lookin' at but what you lookin' at
We in a bar , wanna twist me like a bottle cap

[Mos Def]
I'm tryin' to holler miss to see if you gon' holler back

[Beyonce]
Your game is whack, and no, you will not get your quarter back
See this is Carmen, curves like a cul-de-sac
Skin coffee and cream, your donuts, you ain't dunking that

[Mos Def]
But this is Milla, Lieutenant if you're wonderin'

[Sam Sarpong]
And I'm Natheniel, (Mos Def) Mel Gibson (Sam) Danny Gloverin'

[Beyonce]
But I'm not hearing you, you might as well be mumb-l-in
See, I have dreams  and with a man, what will become of them?
There's not a kid out here who can make me believe
I should postpone my goals, cause he got tricks up his sleeve?
Whole bar full of cuffs and you ain't locking me down

[Mos Def]
I got a warrant for ya heart, in the bed, hold the trial

[Sam]
Get a pardon if ya come with the sargeant now

[Beyonce]
Give  the chair cause I don't care I ain't feelin' your style

[Hook x2]
Yo, I'm tryin' to get with you shorty
(But I'm not feelin' you)
But I'm an officer shorty
(My looks are killin' you)
Murder one will get you under the covers
(Game talker or manslaughter I ain't feelin' you brothers)

[Beyonce]
Eyes like the ocean

[Mos Def]
Ma I got some lotion
Hold ya thighs, raise em' high and daddy long stroke em'

[Beyonce]
Hair like forever

[Sam]
I swear I could do it better
Take the gun out my holster, I still pack a baretta

[Beyonce]
You brothers sweat Carmen like Patrick Ewing
But that kid

[Mos Def]
Don't waste ya time he ain't worth doin'
He just a sargeant, passin' out tickets for parking

[Sam]
Chickenheads cluckin'

[Beyonce]
Pitiful bulls barkin'
See this is Carmen, voice sweet as Marvin
I turn out lights with the switch when I'm walkin'
Girls steady jealous cause they man always hawkin'
Even got Lou lookin' at me like he stalkin'
And I got a mind too, I wouldn't bless you
If your first name was Ha-Chu, on Sunday singin' gospel

[Mos Def]
You ain't a dime just a nickel actin' hostile

[Beyonce]
Headed for the big top and bouncin' off this side show
