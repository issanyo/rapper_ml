Riding along
In my automobile
My baby
Beside me
At the wheel
I stole a kiss
At the turn
Of a mile
My curiosity
Running wild
Crusin' and playin'
The radio
With no particular
Place to go

Riding along
In my automobile
I's anxious
Tto tell her
The way I feel
So I told her
Softly and sincere
And she leaned
And whispered
In my ear
Cuddlin' more
And drivin' slow
With no particular
Place to go

No particular
Place to go
So we parked way
Out on ko-ko-mo
The night was young
And the moon
Was gold
So we both decided
To take a stroll
Can you image
The way I felt
I couldn't
Unfasten her
Safety belt

Riding along
In my calaboose
Still trying
To get her
Belt a-loose
All the way home
I held a grudge
For the safety belt
That wouldn't budge
Crusin' and playin'
The radio
With no particular
Place to go
