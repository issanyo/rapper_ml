[Samuel Christian]
If ignorance is everything that we don't know
And we can only obtain wisdom as we grow
Then why we actin like we just got off the boat
If that's all your mind can perceive we let you go
With so many mistakes to ignorant to know
That it was you, beholder of my own  borough
That hard as that, the "i" in "pride" will kill us slow
So when your children scream my name I let it go

Chorus 2X:
Cuz I come to believe that ain't nuthin' in this world like
You
Ain't nuthin' in this world like you
Ain't nuthin' in this world like you

[Samuel Christian]
Cuz I come to believe that
If you feel that ,I am movin' way too slow
Then just demand, am I one of your own deaf souls?
Ain't scared of it, will take the hit if that's the road
Cuz just for you I clinch my fist to hold the gold
And if that's not enough open my eyes to show me the way
Like you did Moses two tablets ago
And when I'm done I will return to let 'em know
The battl thees over now get ready for the war

Chorus 2X

Cuz I come to believe that--

[Mos Def]
That Cherokee the dark ebony the fly heavenly
Make me forget my federal treasury
Just to be inside the strike zone of your energy
Love blessed thee, come next to me, measure me with memory
I fiend terribly but I still I know you there for me
This thing is scaring me for real, uncruel like 'what the deal?'
Your love is wide like mass appeal
I'm just gon have to mend and have to deal
With how I feel and really really keep it real
And realize you equalize the R E ality, so casually
No fallacy, challenge me to be the man I have to be
For those who will be men and women after me
No time for movin' backwardly my passion flee fantastically
Still I know it's task to me to realize my mastery
And set aside my fantasy
Be everything that all your love has asked of me
From first to the last with me, I pray you keep your hands on me
And let the angels' tablets be, written on behalf of me

[Samuel Christian]
Met her in the ghetto, she went by the name of Nadia
She keep me down to the city life, Nadia Nadia
Cuz I met her in the ghetto, went by the name of Nadia
She keep me bound to the city life, Nadia, Nadia
Cuz I met her in the ghetto
[Mos Def]
In the ghetto
God is in the ghetto
Love is in the ghetto
Truth is the ghetto
Power in the ghetto
