[Stic.man of Dead Prez]
Now let's put it all in perspective
Before the outrage burns out misdirected
What can we do so our community's protected?
I believe that should be our main objective
While we full of rage and we wanna make a difference
Let's do more than protest
Let's make a commitment, to be pro-active
Not just emotional reactin'. Move like G's never passive
Organize safe teams, martial art classes
Get to the gun range and make your aim accurate
Self defense is a must by any tactic
Security protocol, make it a daily practice

[Mikeflo]
They say I look suspicious, I get it all the time
Pro-black face tatted when they drop dime
Follow me get on yo' jack, tell 'em to come get me
Or better yet, yo dun, you be the judge jury
We gotta make better war moves
Police the pigs, polish our own tools
Fight back, become a force to be reckoned
Let 'em feel the consequence pullin' that weapon
They do what they wanna to who they think they can
Understand, there's no respect for the black man
What's the solution, the ballot or the bullet, G?
Gimme that pistol, that vote never give us free
I tell the young people "go 'head, protest."
Petitions, picket signs, citizens arrest
Just know we at war so get your game face on
Hoodie on I bomb first for Trayvon

[M1 of Dead Prez]
I'm tired of the marchin', the rallyin', the protestin'
We hoopin' and hollerin', still we gettin' no justice
Cedeno, Diallo, Bell, Grant and Trayvon
It's the free mix on your radio station
Turn it up so you can drown out all the media hype
We plottin', plannin' and strategizin' ready to fight
The government ain't gon' stop it as long as they make a profit
Off our criminalization our people gon' be a target
Justin Sipp and Wendell Allen, who gon' be next?
Fuck the talkin' get some power then we get some respect
When I die don't put me on a shirt my nigga
Be a revolutionary make 'em hurt my nigga
That's a quote from NY Money that's my RBG family
Stic Man, Mikeflo and Mos Def it's insanity
Cause we do the same thing expectin' different results
I'm checkin' the vital signs but I ain't gettin' no pulse

(Yasiin Bey)
A view from a true G’s perspective
These mic machines oppose all oppression
They appointed here to uphold justice
But it get denied, yo, they cheat and they lie, folk
Hate views, fake moves, and wild hostile
Young black world in a struggle for survival
Great stress in effect, disrespect, disconnect
Judged on why these skittles and iced tea
Gun shots and blood that break the nights raids
A self-appointed judge, it might be Nazi
Insecurity identity doubt
You think that they see a neighbor, they see a villain is out
Standard answer it was random police movement
Inconclusive confusion, the present news clips, callous bullshit
Every talking head is clueless, man they stuck on channel stupid
Sick of the town, we know it’s win that
It’s time to fix that for every place we live at
Put in work where ought to change the wack facts
That make you holler in the hour when they say that

They shootin’, made you die
They act as if the murder in a sense is not crime
Killers on the run, watchmen your times up, Mr. Murder where you hidin’ at, they shootin’, made you die
They act as if the murder in a sense is not crime
Killers on the run, watchmen your times up, I hope hear this
Right where you’re hidin’ at
