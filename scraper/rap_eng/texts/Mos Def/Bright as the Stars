{*man talking*}
Haha yeah, but you brothers gotta be careful
I mean that ain't your average, garden variety
Run of the mill gangster bullshit
Y'all hardcore, but you got a edge
Just look at ya, together
You, you little black stovepipe colored nigga
You are the same complexion as Marcus Garvey
The man that brought self love
To the black consciousness movement of the 1930s
And now when we speak about complexion
We move into (???) of where y'all comin from
Yeah, red boned, variety covered
Genie in a bottle lookin motherfucker
You are the same complexion as Malcolm X
Ooh I'm tellin you you brothers you're gonna be large
But like I said, you gotta be careful
See, cuz you are tellin the truth

(Talib Kweli)
Me and my man came out to put it down
Yeah, we bout to do it all over again
Here we go

A lotta cats like to get on the microphone and front
They say they rollin the paper like they ran outta blunts
Tell ya how much the Soundscan of the month
The man tell you to just do it
We never let the man take advantage of us
You get props off the diamonds you rented
I get my props off the rhymes I invented
Cuz I spoke my mind and I meant it
Like Tae Bo with a bow tie, kicked your ass with class
And we still take it to Brooklyn when we ready to splash
Me and Hi-Tek got you ready to blast
I'm all ready to last, I stay hungry like I'm ready to fast
Married to the movement like a (???)
The rhyme veteran
You actin real bitch right now like a lesbian thespian
Since they let me in the back I've been droppin you
(???), stay fresh and clean like hospitals
In the war the Cris' poppin, the wallet to wrist watches
You ever think the wrist is watchin you
That's why the cops is stoppin you
Nigga please, they can track you down anywhere
Your cell phone transmittin radiation through your ear
Your 2-Way is way too new and obsolete next year
Navigational system show you how to get there
And you ain't think about how you got here
Do you know where you are?
What happened today? Back in the day they used to follow the stars
Spillin so much you gotta catch it in bottles and jars
And make MCs eat their words and swallow their bars
Oh my god

(Mos Def)
Uh it's me (who?) Mos, the most beautiful, plain and unusual
Black Star rockin with that hot shit you're movin to
Massively musical that creep into your tuner to
The top of the dial shit, that you don't know my style shit
It's what them Brooklyn niggas stay on foul wit'
No matter what the scene is surroundin
Yo, whether I'm on the grind or loungin
I'm live and he say that I'm foundin
Must suffer all the niggas I'm down wit'
This announcement gon' keep the ghetto bouncin
Where people find pleasure in measurements and ounces
Midwest, big stress is more houses
Down South slangin the twang that it's pronounced in
East on that foul shit, West, they straight clownin
Black Star got the shit they all get down wit'
Don't tell me you gonna seen or been around in
(Mos Def) Terror stricken on your block
I am the mucher worker with the hottest hand
I keep it cookin like pots and pans
I know that haters got their plots and scams
But they simply can't stop my clan
It's mighty Mos and super Kwa, my man
Black Star my fam
About to move on the hearts of man
Until a small heart of hearts expand
Newer day, dog start the jam
And I spit flame that spark the jam
Heavy hittin shit across the fence
In other words I'm of the wall with this
I drop heavy jewels and ornaments
To make 'em shine a little more with this
