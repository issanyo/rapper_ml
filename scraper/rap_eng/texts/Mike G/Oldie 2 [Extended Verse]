[Verse: Mike G]
What the fuck is caution?
Often I leave em flossin' and KAWS x's next to coffins
Lost in translation
The Dreams you chase
Got you diving for the plates like you're stealing home base
That's great
I'm home alone dreaming of two on one's
With Rihanna and Christina Milian, bring it on
And Travis is in the closet, organizing and hanging
The tramp three Lettermans that Ace has been making him
No strays while we catching matinees huh?
I'm getting blazed thinking about those days
I'll have the top off the GT-3 like toupees
One finger in the air all's fair when crime pays
My grand scheme of things is to be attach to the game
Like bitches to their wedding rings
You don't need to look 'cuz we gleam obscene
In the light riding slow till my yellow diamonds shining like the
Batman logo over Gotham
Rock L.A. to Harlem, and if you say "Get 'em Mike G" then I got em
One man squadron
Nigga I'm a problem for brigs I got bars
And plans to pimp these polish bitches into pop stars
Humanity kills, we all suffer from insanity still
And if I said it then it is or it's going to be real
OF till I OD and I probably will
Study me autopsy reveals
I'll be the only nigga to die from being too real
You're prolly trynna find your style still
I'm trynna find chicks that look like del Rio in Brazil
What's crazy is At this rate see
I'm advancing so fast I think technolodgy hates me
No one ever really though I was great
Now I'm trynna see how far a couple features will take me
Don't hate haste but I appreciate patience
Military raised I raid bases and stations
That's real but I know how it feels
When satisfactions like you don't even know how you waited
From now on dates don't matter I'm timeless
They waitin' for the day to come when I don't rhyme sick
Envy the way I think cause you can't buy this
I know where their mind is nowhere near where mine is
Come to me to get some air in your lungs
I get it done, What you need is what I stock in sums
I have excess, so each release is like dropping a bomb
To leave you conscious, never delirious
I'm a mysterious one
Sixth sense has me thinking I'm prone to none
And visually has me thinking as life is Playstation
If I was one I'd overheat I'm so on
So gone, so rad, with a bad bitch with Timbs on
Her Wardrobe consist of Versace and Louboutin
Got more trees than hemp cons
Main reason people listen to my songs
Is 'cuz I'm a God damn American Icon
They planned against me they couldn't be more wrong
I never hate opinions cause they can do no harm
I go on and on my bars sicker than yours
Get claps for my cars I drive around in applause
I tell her only look back if you do it for me
And Jack Frost so cold you must maneuver with skis
Just believe I do it with ease, do what you please
You've been looking for me I've been flying over seas
I've been isolated on islands
I deserve a chick that's not a dime shes a diamond
It's no news, if you contest who rules, you lose
Step up every week in new shoe's I cruise
Every chick is like "Damn he's smooth"
I need rocks that weigh me down I can't stand these jewels
How real is that? My oldest games are still in tact
Stand out from the back, I'm like the champagne of rap
I'm that nice, decline if you can't pay that price
I pop up like reflex sights hold up
Black diamonds you can see in the night
No luck to those that are green with envy
I'm simply bred to win see
Entry was a decade before turn of the century
So I'm a hundred and ten percent
Most classic, best to rule most cool, most authentic
I could prolly come up with limitless sentences
But I don't talk much unless you're listening
Your efforts are as futile as resistance is
But my rhymes accessories live, I'm a different being
Spectacles low and behold I'm quite something to see
If I'm not the best I'm the person the best want's to be
So anytime I hear them talk I feel they're talking bout me
And ya voice ain't got enough bass
Skinny nigga but my name holds a lot of weight
I spend my days looking for something to fill my plate
Candles get blown when we get baked
And it's not even my birthday I want the whole cake
No need for lawyers, it's never up for debate
They hate, I'm doing great
We can orchestrate one band one sound
But if any nigga play then it's one man down
Lyrically, I'm past borderline mastermind
I don't think there's another nigga like me in this time
I work smart and hard buy it like why wait
The closest thing I had to a job was O8
So since 09 I professionally rhymed
With poise and stance
And that year my favorite model won Miss France
That's just motivation to put every doubter in urns
I hope that they never learn
So I can spit fire until they're overly burned
I play till I'm finished I don't take turns
Kill quick but I'm still screamin' die slow bitch
'Cuz I'm so Malicious like dude from the Clipse is
Lame niggas speak relentless some might be right but fact is
They're on forums and I'm on flights
Vanish fast like places we pass when our mind roams
Hit gas give whiplash til we arrive home
I need theme music no way I'm entering alone
So I'm bumpin oldies off my cellular phone

[Outro: Frank Ocean]
Down in muscle beach pumpin' iron and bone
Bumpin' Oldies off my cellular phone
