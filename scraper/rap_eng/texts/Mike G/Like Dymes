Good evening ladies and gentlemen

This Verses 3

[Verse]
They didn't see this coming
I could sky dive and hit the ground running
Counting casualties after two minute massacres
I float in the breeze, With or without a passenger
Hey, please believe, I rap laps and that's fact
You'll have to back track
Full bags and jet lag but c'est la vie
And anyone who approaches me should vacate please
Cause I bang like that 808's and bass heavy beats, that's these..
Compliment the track so well
I'm basically beatboxing for championship belts
I'm not nice
People might just have to introduce themselves twice
Still screaming "High life" and can't stop
I'm Mr. 3k, tryna get me in the hall of fame spot
Practice my swing after dark
But when I get old I know I'll still hit the ball way out of Miller Park
My flow spark, I'm fly, you should call me Static Shock
At night my eyes glow, passion burning from the heart
Ghost Rider on four tires, my head on fire
With the heat that I be thinking of, my degree in art
This vehicle I can't park
On the road all the time
I don't glow no more, I shine
Drop anyone of you that's wasting my time
Drop one of a kind rhymes like dimes

[Outro]
