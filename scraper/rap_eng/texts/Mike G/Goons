[Verse 1]
See I can come at this one or two ways
I can play the wild card or I can keep it contained
It's safe to say they say they do this
But it results in no plays
They be at it for weeks and months
But just to be sounding the same
We just be doing our thing
I felt like causally spitting
Had to wait to create
Damn shit sound inconvenient
I think I need some new lenses
I can make out the colors
But that's a blurry ass image
Forgive me
Oh why they think me condensing
So livid when things are going good
Was never hood
Mama raised me right but I ain't by the book
Bada Bing a nigga if he bringin' problems
Probably couldn't see me cause
I'm back lit
But blacks lit

[Chorus]
Light feet when the GP on the rooftop
I tell them just to quit with the discouragement like do stop
Can't get too mad
Keep it cool lil' homie
Now you know me breathing like Woosa
Light feet when the GP on the rooftop
I tell them just to quit with the discouragement like do stop
Can't get too mad
Keep it cool lil' homie
Now you know me breathing like Woosa

[Verse 2]
Careful you better tip toe
And make sure you don't slip bro
Tread lightly
Especially when you walking past the window
Cause what you see inside this house tends to be like crescendos
Cooling smoking on some indo but all these niggas my friends though
The party hardly feeds my need to speak to smarties
If I wanted dead meat a nigga be doing some damage at Arbys
These fools testing me like the SAT
The pester be about the circles that I fill in
My fates decided by how hard I work and
Circles I chill in I'm chillin'
Killin' off those who feeling the feelings significant man
But you ain't listening man
Walk soft like sloth paws
Build suspense like long pause
My heads in places you don't wanna think about
Your moms draws
We riding presidentially
My niggas Lewensky
Find us in the woods man we be where the tents be
Gents be pressing
But soon they will learn lessons
About the art of not stressing
Man fuck your Smith and your Wesson
I'm pressing issues with slick dudes
Tryna see my chick move
Tissues abundant to the girls that I said dip to
Light feet you gotta walk before you run shit
We fighting matches with you remedials so we dumb lit

[Verse 3]
Seems we at war with ourselves
There's a killer in everybody when we get lost in our hell
That fire can burn any minute
Ain't no asking for help
The thirst defeats the purpose
On the surface there has to be a want for themselves
Thinking of thoughts of I should tell
Heard lies telling the truth I listen close
Savage with a heart of gold
Wasn't supposed to hear glad I know me
I know these nights are full of resentment
Caught the words I needed I listen
Can't be save from fruition
Been stuck in your tailored suit
Good thing I didn't fit the shoes
I save myself from you
I guess the chase just come through tunes
Fuck your truths and lies contrast too much too soon
Face the payment I'ma hate it
If I'm chasing the pavement
Have at last earned what I've gathered from
Hope I've strangled what's left of the bold built up stature
Done
Told his tale stored stories in the head of black wearing nuns
Always wearing plain colors cuz old habits always seem to dye dappered up
Thank you much
Focused on adding sum fatal stats to show the raptures come
Guess pasta boy is hazardous
Didn't even make the lights flash in the past I'd end up asking but the question isn't what happened the answers are written some
Hopefully you notice these moments needs some Jodeci
Rolling over and over fear of focusing on folding sheets
Hope holding your hopeless dreams
I'll be honest
You'll never be running up under the sunset safe and
I don't have the patience
Embrace it

[Chorus]
Light feet when the GP on the rooftop
I tell them just to quit with the discouragement like do stop
Can't get too mad
Keep it cool lil' homie
Now you know me breathing like Woosa
Light feet when the GP on the rooftop
I tell them just to quit with the discouragement like do stop
Can't get too mad
Keep it cool lil' homie
Now you know me breathing like Woosa
