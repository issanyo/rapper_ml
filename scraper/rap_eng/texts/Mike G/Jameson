[Verse 1]
I need front page, no delays, no discussion
No holds barred, no bluffing, no fakes no less than first place
A case and rate, Do not disturb, as we react instinctively from interruptions
I breathe, leave scenes that could not be worse
Love the whips so much, I'll probably drive my hearse
That means I'm rolling til i'm Audi 5000 and five star
Outtings seven figure with the housing in the mountains
What you bout? See I'm on clouds til everyday ain't a drought
Rather fly high outside than be slumped on no couch
And you say you're down to rise, if you front then be out
When we pack fans in it goes down without a doubt
Come with grands in hand, we'll have nothing to complain about
You're taking the loser's route, hoping to make it out
Trying to find what you're worth, I'm hoping these words hurt
Til I'm in the dirt, I'ma rip the head off this fucking Earth
I'm in the streets, GT3, Mike G, see

[Hook]
We don't fuck with too much of y'all shit
I said we don't fuck with too much of y'all shit
We don't fuck with too much of y'all shit
Said we don't fuck with too much of y'all shit

[Verse 2]
Find me ridin to myself cause I don't fuck with nothing
Keep rolling up, I can't get high enough
And my assumption, everybody wants something
Not much for fronting, I put my engine in the trunk
A fast car fanatic, Adam bomb addict
I got a beautiful chick, whenever she want it, she can have it
Make niggas change their views quicker than hoes change clothes
Now I change outfits before my shows
Yo, I came up in a dash, you can blame it on my past
Now I ask, what's life without your foot on the gas?
It's not worth talking about if it didn't last
And it's not an epic battle and two titans don't clash
No my scales don't tip, toe don't make sounds, Wait
What's touching down if you can't break grounds
I'm continuously giving you the energy you need
To overpower and devour all your enemies, Mike G

[Outro: Mike G & (Earl)]
I know you see me in the streets but
(We don't fuck with too much of y'all shit)
Niggas be like "look at me, look at me, see"
(We don't fuck with too much of y'all shit)
I think it would cool if we never meet
(We don't fuck with too much of y'all shit)
And don't give me your CD
(Cause we don't fuck with too much)
Said we don't fuck with too much of y'all shit
