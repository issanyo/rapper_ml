[Intro: Joshua Zucker & Tyler, The Creator]
Josh: Hey how does it feel?
Tyler: What?
Josh: Driving this
Tyler: Uh, every time I get in I'm actually like, yo this is crazy, like I did this. Like, I find you, this is, it's, it's weird. It's push to fucking start. A year ago, a year and four months ago, I was broke as fuck
Josh: That's wild

[Verse 1: Mike G and Tommy Swisher]
My weed is from Cali
I don't think they know, but they notice, ugh
Step in Adidas like soldiers
If you got cameras, keep 'em in focus, yeah
Gold in my mouth and it's real, ha
Shut up lil boy cause I'm here, ha
Smile make your bitch disappear
She rubbing my cum with her tears
Uh, keeping it fresh like it's baking soda
Stay hi to the cities, I'm flying over
Impressive ain't even the word, I'm
The boss in this shit, and you taking orders
Yeah, roll with my dogs, we got flavor, we winning
Smoking on doja, I play with her kitty
Who do it better, he lyin', you trippin'
Bitches look pretty and ride in my beater
People praise the things he say
Cut up so much, I should be my own DJ
Ride through L.A. like a race, first place
Smoke enough to make new clouds in space
This shit is too easy, I know they can't eat me
I cut through it all, I don't want to be greedy
Seeing new states, juicy fruit plates, shots of D'ussé
Naked models in my room, and I just woke up too

[Hook: Mike G x2]
Backwoods and Balmains
Hennessy and Rosé
Good green and drank, yeah, make a bitch go crazy, ay

[Verse 2: Theo Ferragamo]
Putting on, and yeah the world know
We been going cross the damn globe
Couple bands for the clothes I'm wearing
Black diamonds and fine dining
Mike hit 'em with the old school
We rolling up zips of that doja
Just look a lil' closer, my cup runnin' over
I'm spilling that purple, you know I ain't sober
Your hoe coming with me, you know she a roller
Bet she can't wait just to ride in that rover
Backwoods and Balmain, nigga
Join the campaign, nigga
We smoking on octane, see my ring, looking like a glazed
Ay, Gucci sips that lemonade
We dripping sauce like fountain waters
You ain't never seen the border
Smelling like Italian odors
Double G, like what it cost you?
Pay the price to be the boss
Pay that price to get that loft, backwood and Balmain nigga
Backwood and Balmain
Backwood and Balmain

[Hook x2]

[Outro: OG Maco]
You know, I'm happy that people fuck with it, cause I mean they relate to it. [?] Of course they could give a fuck, but that's I'm ready for the other songs to get, really you know, two minute and three minute cause people wake up, and they're like, Oh shit
