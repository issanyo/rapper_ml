[Verse 1: Hodgy Beats]
Hodgy Beats Mike G...
Wolf gang... golf wang... kill 'em all...

I feel like committing Role Royces, no choices
I hear voices, comprehend I would brand the trend
The devil tells me to get in , so she can take me for a spin
She said he had a lover, and I'm looking just like him
Slim Jim and Jim's Tims, what's my muthafucking name?
She spittin' so much game that it's a muthafucking shame
Why do I hate religion? every single step I'm sinning
Every single song is winning, but my soul is jailed in prison
I'm tired of struggles and lies, can I get above the fly?
Baby girl need a hug, don't cry, get a second cause I might know why
Your a girl, I'm one guy, that's the thing everybody gon' try
Till plotters will plot the y... why?

[Hook: Hodgy Beats]
Su-ic-ide is a path we all must take and face
But what happens when you wanna
Live
When you wanna live
When you wanna live
When you wanna live
Su-ic-ide is a path we all must take and face
But what happens when you wanna
Live
When you wanna live
When you wanna live
When you wanna live

[Verse 2: Mike G]
Uh, there's no reason to make it more than it's not
You think it's easy, the truth is I give it more than I got
These niggas feed it for a name, they fade, we remain
It's all fun and games 'til there's money to be made
You remember me? niggas feel it three so now they envy me
But you see, my surface is usually less then what it's meant to be
Can't help but think that this is what is meant to be
So not living the life is the thing that fucks with me mentally
Cause shit, dreams don't come true, expectations hard to do
Niggas talk a lot but hardly do, what they aught to do
My niggas are surviving the streets, for one reason
Niggas ain't living to kill, niggas just dying to eat... uh
