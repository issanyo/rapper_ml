[Intro: Mike G]
Aye, Yeah
Yup, yup
Mike G
It's that party shit, that old school
You know we had to come through
Keep it real groovy
We gonna do it like this...

[Verse 1: Mike G]
Aye! Yo!
All my ladies on the floor, with the best d√©cor
Give me everything that's yours
Give me something to adore
It's not enough I need more, places to explore
When I shoot, Imma bank it off the backboard
Counting trips off shores, it's hard to keep score
When you shine this bright, it's hard to see stars
Getting so high, trying to live above the law
Move so fast so others can't get involved
I seen dude's lose often, fools too soft
Running off with the sauce, man
Hundred thousand kids saying "this dude's awesome"
Any fake friends along the way, I hope I lost 'em
Any offense might cause presidential pardons
Any rating they should give him ten like Rodman
Hop in the porsche and skate off like Erick Koston
Out the blue might just shoot like John Stockton
Thats three points
Watch how you walkin
Steps of importance
Can't take the bitches when they talk cause they annoyin'
Make it out the streets to seek better employment
Niggas like me might rush your apartment
Niggas like me rock adidas, that's three stripes
Not three strikes
Dreamin just to get my cream right
Gotta get my team right
Jet stream flights
Can't remember nights
At least may we exceed the stereotypes
The lesser seen learn lessons between the green lights
Jack Frost so cold, you should say I breathe ice
Got top notch flows; elite and supreme like
Gain rock star dough, my genes are Gene like
Simmonds, feel like a brand new beginning
Cuz i'm fresher than presidential tenants hotel linens
In an all white suit posted up with the villians
With two cups spillin'
Man, I keep em guessin', no question
I hope you give it yo best, and show the game some respect
Untamed and unchained is my preference
Bars nor women won't keep me oppressed and
Shawty trynna be wifey but i'm uninterested
"He need the Lord in him!" shouted out in my confessions
I exclude whoever settles for what's left
And my shit groove, make you two step like you hesitant
Mike G For President!
Ayee, yuh
