[Intro]
Yeah this will be something new for you
I don't talk much no one has to know what we do
Your part of a chosen few
You can start anew despite what others have put you through
Come see a better side of life and take a walk up in these shoes

[Verse 1]
Come to me when your skies are grey or blue
Show me what your into
Together we can change the rules
No one taught this in school
I think that's down right wrong
It's up to you, see you'll get better as time goes along
You see you'll find that you've grown
And i might leave home alone
And hit the streets like I'm superbad looking for Emma stone
I can stay in one place for long
See this man was made to roam
Till I run in every race, till I rule in every zone

[Hook]
See ladies ask if I pimp I say I'm not one
So I shouldn't walk with a limp still I got one
Everyone knows you dealing with pros and it shows
They call me jack frost 'cuz my product on froze
I don't know why they don't like me
They call me Jack frost everything icy on me
Game's so cold take a walk with me
And watch these yellow bricks turn to gold, we can roll

[Verse 2]
See my words work so well
I bring in new clientele
They say they don't want you?
They're frontin' more than pharell
At times you drive me berserk
When you put me through hell
But I could never let you go you have a walk like Chanel
You wear clothes by Donatella shirts, shades, and belts
And live life not concerned with problems with them or yourself
You know the better you do things the more we excel
Married to the game Might get fame and glory as well
See were supposed top prevail the odds are stacked against you
The boys in blue will do their best just to try to keep you in a cell
But they never had to deal with your issues, and they fight for different reasons
Say when your gone they'll miss you you were something to believe in
Progression is a sequence I'll be something you can't see
But I'll get in your brain so deep and make you nod in agreement
But you score to make it evens shoot at the boards you make more
This is my award tour so what more are we waiting for?

[Hook]
