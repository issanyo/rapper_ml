All me do is smoke, smoke, smoke, smoke
Smoke, smoke, smoke

[Hook: Diligence]
Smoke and get high, tears in my eye's
Why the High Grade do me that?
We go long, know we smoke and get high
Til we Retreat ain't going back down

[Verse 1: Mike G]
I go weed shopping and pick it off the list
Caught it like gymnast I got it off the flip
Their wave cause rifts mine can uplift
I keep mine, rasta man don't pass no spliff
Seen colors when I said it, and set it like the tone
I been telling people get ready all along
I ain't gon do you wrong. If you want a spot
You gotta work for one, love, I got it for a song
Anytime, anywhere we never running out
No shame every time you see me breaking down
That's just my thought's I said it out loud
Skys blue as my Porsche. I'm stepping on clouds

[Hook: Diligence]
Smoke and get high, tears in my eye's
Why the High Grade do me that?
We go long, know we smoke and get high
Til we Retreat ain't going back down
Smoke and get high, tears in my eye's
Why the High Grade do me that?
We go long, know we smoke and get high
Til we Retreat ain't going back down

[Bridge: Gamo]
Smoke, smoke, smoke, smoking
More, more than four we rolling
[Diligance]
You see me smiling
Me and my friends them joking
Circle out west, then cash out dem
Spliff after spliff non me not outing
Me love my high grade so much, every day we rollin

This gon be a breeze, blowing then it sways
All my trees beast, breaking out the cage
Trynna burn down the spot, blazing on the stage
Rolling out the rhymebook blazing on the page
Married to Mary Jane, I had to engage
You can follow my words or take it out the phrase
That's fire. I got something for your supplier
Though I'm trynna get higher, Content where I stay, see

[Hook: Diligence]
Smoke and get high, tears in my eye's
Why the High Grade do me that?
We go long, know we smoke and get high
Til we Retreat ain't going back down
Smoke and get high, tears in my eye's
Why the High Grade do me that?
We go long, know we smoke and get high
Til we Retreat ain't going back down
