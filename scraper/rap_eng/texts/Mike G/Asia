[Verse 1: Mike G]
This earth told me to hold my ground
My music showed me nobody can match my sound
Mos Def said if it's something you can change around
Then keep quiet, you got nothing to complain about
Now, I told you I would hold you down
I told you that we were kings and queens uncrowned
Too hard to break down, you were too compound
Though at times you feel I wish that they could see me now
I won't feel like I made it, until my maids work grave shifts
Paint this, honest, with a flow so heinous
Dreams will land you further than any promise could take us
And everything now is documentation
Just wait, you'll see gain when the pace gets made
Nothing's rewarded for loitering but patience gets paid
They'll tell you that time is money, and that's fact
If you're lucky you'll get more minutes but not the same ones back

[Bridge: Mike G] (x2)
So hold the 99 problems cause I'd rather have none
Never know who might come
And you'll need new shoes when the blues get sung
And some for when you run
Cause you should be right behind if not already number 1, uh

[Verse 2: Mike G]
They're a star, you're a sun, just bigger but by far
Without you everyone's world would stay dark
There's no need to listen to the others when they talk
You're brighter than they are, you're needed when days start
You ask how you reach the top when they don't give you a shot
But you have no reason to stop to say a failure's what I'm not
And people around me, they say that I'm crazy
But I do what I gotta do to get to where I wanna be
Cause you're just like me, I know you know what you're worth
And you can't brag about the things that you don't deserve
It's a cold world, you must know the correct way to spell it
And people will use things according to how you sell it
You're expected to know no one will warn you
If you're not willing to do something, no one should do it for you
Pay attention closely, it's not difficult to see
I'm way ahead of everything, leave everything up to me
