[Verse 1]
I saw the white light comin'
I saw the red rush onto my bed
Over my duvet cover
I woke up on the wrong side of it

[Pre-Chorus]
Nobody heard the shots
(There’s no witness)
Nobody called the cops
(No one’s business)
Now I've got this hole in the front of my chest
Somehow, I’m still alive, just my
My heart is dead

[Chorus]
Oooh, my heart is dead, girl
Oooh, It doesn’t beat no more
My heart is dead, girl
My heart is dead

[Verse 2]
I left my back door open
It must’ve struck while I was asleep
I should’ve seen this comin'
That kind of hit you only get from lovin'

[Pre-Chorus]
Nobody took the blame
(no one’s busted)
No one was locked away
(there’s no justice)
Just this gaping hole in the font of my chest
Somehow, I’m still alive, just my
My heart is dead

[Bridge]
I’m a zombie in disguise
(he’s still breathing’ — how’s he still breathin’?)
I’m a ghost, yeah, I can’t feel no-thin’ inside

[Post Bridge]
It’s like I died
But, I’m still alive
I’m not upset
No worries
Just...

[Alt Chorus]
Ooh, there's no justice, no...
Oooh, Nobody took the blame
No one was locked away
I just had to let you know
My heart is...
