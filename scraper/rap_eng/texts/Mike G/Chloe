Mike G, yo
Uh, Midtown..

[Verse 1]
Catch me in foreign countries, I'm taking pictures in the lobby
You can't copy how I floss, I mix OF & Versace
How many people you know, flex interviews with Vogue?
Fresh, from my head, high down to the floor, oh
No pain from drinking champagne
Come and ride with me, I can make your life change
I say no names, play no games
And if you don't, then we're one in the same
See, you can never go full speed til you're in your own lane
I come to any event, draped in gold chains
I do it because I'm young and have everything to gain
Staying true to every single letter in my name
Things will never be the same
I find myself pushing hard all my pedals in the rain
I'm so vain, but I don't care
They should announce my name before I walk down stairs

[Hook]
And her skin color tells you she's the perfect mix
And I'm so classic, I think I'm stuck in '96
I'm so fly, I can make it to heaven from hell
And I make  a mess of things, but I clean up well
They say my style is advanced
That's cause I shop in England and France
And you can do what ever people will say that you can't
But luck will get you no where if you don't take a chance

[Verse 2]
See I'm so futuristic, my military enlisted me
With high roles of significance as leader in logistics
Women love it when you're consistent
And no other chick is mentioned. That's how I get 'em
Persistence, stay in their mouths more than dentist
Music changes when you learn, there's so much more to a song
It takes long to heal a burn, it's so easy to do wrong
It's on, and only stops if you accept defeat
Made a mission, finish things strong, finish complete
Life to me is more than of name shoes on your feet
If you don't know my name, then you should know I run with elites
I ran the streets back when I used to loop up beats
I'm on models and singers asking me when we're gonna meet
I'm so unique, see that you can't see me
Break rules, believe and see I'm a few times three
And me, well there's no other like me on the earth
And what I've seen and heard, I can captivate with words

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Hey gorgeous, I can love you like I love Porches
Could paint pictures but it's hard to capture perfect in portraits
If you with it, we can go wherever the world calls us
Tonight everything you see in me can be all yours
They used to take my words, twist em, and run
But you can take me every morning as you rise up the sun, uh-huh
I take it affectionate fun
I'm not a dog, I'm a wolf and a lion in one
As I cannot be contained, just let me explore
And I have seen many lands but none like yours
You won't have to tell me which way to go
Guide myself like I've these steps before
Cubans with red lipstick be my Christine
We kill em all and drive away clean from murder scenes
If you're French, you could be like Chloe to me
And I hold on to you like you hold onto bags from Celine, see
She's my main thing when I'm where she stay
She's my out of town girl when she's in LA
Together we shine bright, we equate to sun rays
Know that talk is cheap but that's the price you pay
They say my style is advanced
That's cause I shop in England and France
And you can do whatever people say you can't
But luck will get you nowhere if you don't take a chance
