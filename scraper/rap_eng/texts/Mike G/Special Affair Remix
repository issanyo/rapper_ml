[Verse 1: Mike G]
Yeah, give me a minute
Give me every percent of your attention
Listen, what I say, don't forget it then
You'll never come second again
If we still in it to win it, just give me a second to finish
I'm 10 out of 10
You see the difference amongst us
We live how we want
And the others, well they just pretend
I don't play Clark Kent, you play hard to get
That's a game that nobody wins
So hard to say a love lasts forever
Because I don't have forever to spend
If it's my riches you want, then there's plenty others
You better go get it from him
I need the grandest evenings
No cops when we speeding
No greeting, no introductions

[Chorus: Syd Bennett]
I bet this Patron make you feel nice and comfortable
Tryna act nice girl, your cover's blown
But you already knew that
You already knew that
You already knew that

[Bridge: Mike G (Syd)]
(We can burn one)
I just need you to be patient
I might arrive light years late
But through the stars I command all time and space (We can burn one)
I'm thinking, "What more can I do?"
Only put my trust in few
I see the flaws in this world, I see what's special in you

[Verse 2: Mike G]
I got some things that I know you can't live without
I don't talk much, my words are worth more than all the gold that's been found
I'm walking on air, it's a special affair
Every time I come out the house
My entrances should be announced
I'm cold, making snow in the south, whoa
Hold on to something, I just lost control
Get in, don't ask where we 'bout to go
You should come here and sit down on this throne
My seats sit low, don't slam my doors
It's serious
We 'bout to go to work as if we each found a new career
We need to be pulling up in multi-colored Carreras
You already know when I'm here

[Chorus]

[Bridge (x2): Mike G]
I just need you to be patient
I might arrive light years late
But through the stars I command all time and space
I'm thinking "What more can I do?"
Only put my trust in few
I see the flaws in this world, I see what's special in you
