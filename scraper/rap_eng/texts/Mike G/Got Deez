Blowing the gonja, whipping the coup
Me and the troops, killing the booth

These niggas don't get it, so tell'em the truth
I bigger than you
All these shoes, I cannot choose
All my haters wanna see me lose
But my niggas won’t let me lose
My niggas got scraps, don't need my tools
My niggas got whips, don't need my whips
Them diamonds. the ice on me gone drip
These niggas so foul, w'all so flagrant
