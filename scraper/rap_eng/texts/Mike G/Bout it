Intro
Im bout it, bitch im bout it

Bridge:
Got to be in this game to win it
All you niggas ride the bench

Some be even on the block
Got yo bitch ridin' wit me

Chorus:
Come with all that plexin'
And we beefin' off top
Put yo bitch on that molly
She gone drop it like its hot
Im precise with all my dough

Houston rockets 94'

All my niggas we about it
We'll come see about it
Dont just bump boy we about it
That shit you talkin' we about it
All my niggas we about it
We'll come see about it

Verse 1:
I be poundin' yo lil hoe
The bitch gone go

I ain't have to spend no chips
Truth be told she not yo hoe
We some ballhogs for them bucks
Lead assist on my team
Im like rondo with this shit
All i see is green
I be all over this cash
Whole lot of cake
Like its my birthday bash
Thumbin' thru a check
Yea i just might spaz
Just blew a eight
Of some straigt gas
Run through a ounce
Let a couple days pass
If you not first of course you last
Runnin' up the balance yea i just do laps
(runnin' up the balance yea i just do laps)


Chorus:
Come with all that plexin'
And we beefin' off top
Put yo bitch on that molly

Houston rockets 94'
That shit you talkin' we about it
All my niggas we about it
We'll come see about it
Dont just bump boy we about it
That shit you talkin' we about it
All my niggas we about it
We'll come see about it

Verse 2:
Im so quick to hope on shit
Like hoes be quick to hop on dick
Money so long but these haters so sick
But thats just how the game is
Pockets so deep you can jump in
I wouldn't do it if you cannot swim
Yo girl mouth is my play pin
Those same lips she kiss you wit
I love the game she love me back
Thats why when I do it no holdin' me back
Usin' both hangs yea I beat up tracks
Killin' most you niggas heart attack
I go monte for them bucks
I be shootin' way to much
My nigga dbell be so clutch
Hear that (insert @dbellondatrack producer tag) hoes go nuts
