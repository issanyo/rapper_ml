(Mike G)
Mike G… Lavish… Mike Check

And his own story was as curious as his narrative
The tale of his life is the tale of a writer of incredible vision
An astute analyst and pundit
A lyricist compassionate and callus
A reckless hedonist, and disaffected malcontent

(Verse 1)
Hey yo, Exhibit A, this is proof that I’m better than
Proof that I’m heaven sent, proof of my residence
Speak the truth in the booth since he’s ever been
Ever been back again, better than he’s ever been
Live out his dreams to the mic till it give out
And for career, they know exactly what this shits about
You know what I mean, and they feel what I dish out
Still the real to my soul, and this wish out
But If I’m evident ‘bout the road that I’m dreaming about
Its fuck the world, no remorse, pullin’ burners out
Like a soldier gone to war without doubt
AK’s on my enemies is laid out, you niggas played out, and PS 1
And all that shit that you rap about don’t mean shit to me
Can’t spit to me, y’all ain’t got shit on me
And this contingency, check my consistency
About to knick your head off nigga relentlessly
Got the game on lock, on lock like I’m a industry
You niggas industry, nigga we in the streets
And when you, call the top nigga ask for me
Cuz I’m there, I’m everywhere and they still can’t see me
No you couldn’t see me on TV, couldn’t see me in a movie
Red and blue glasses couldn’t see me in 3d
Choking tracks won’t let that bitch breathe
One song streets call me Mr. Cocaine keys and I rap over Cocainkeys
And this shit comes easy to Mike G-zy, believe me…
I never swam down that creek I just float
They got canoes, I got the yacht nigga not the same boat
And I’m not gonna begin again, I’m just gonna pass the torch like an Olympian
L-…let that bitch breathe…

And his own story was as curious as his narrative
The tale of his life is the tale of a writer of incredible vision
An astute analyst and pundit
A lyricist compassionate and callus
A reckless hedonist, and disaffected malcontent

(Lavish)
It’s like…I’ma be the best so…I gotta prove to em… LaVish… Mike G…yeah… alright

(Verse 2)
I’m here and I’m running this shit now
Stand up rapper you other niggas can sit down
Shit on the mornin’, I don’t take piss now
Tryna grow up, but I’m still a kid now
Came through the game shining like big lights
And I can see you like Africans at midnight
Features too darky and lights too dim
A million of 'em wanna live life like him
But the jays on time nights like him
Hoppin’ on planes, take flights like him
Only problem is that you not like him
I’m supreme like the logo beside my brim
Fans wave like a float at a parade
And they don’t gotta guess who I am like charades
Maybe it’s the cash that we spend on fashion
That keep ‘em comfortable, they calling me LaVish
Y’all got stacks where my team carry plastic
Whip the game around like a champion gymnastics
Floatin’ through the city in the air like Aladdin
The longer they keep me off the shelf like cabinets
When I started, they said I wasn’t half nice
Now I’m getting everything you buy, half-price
Though they always play me off for the bad guy
I’m balling for the game while you pausing for halftime
We ain’t grow up, living like the Cosby’s
So many Bentley’s, you can call me Fonzy
They say he crazy, they way I go Ali
Crazier than ozley, getting deals no charges
She Gina, so I must be Martin
Glow on fire, you see my tires sparking
Wake up in the morning, and I shine when it’s foggy
Throw money out, broke niggas wish they call me
Yeah…. you can keep on flossing
Pull up and your eyes bigger than Emma Ross’
Yeah, yeah keep on flossin’
And your eyes bigger than the principle of Ross’

My Journey has brought me to an understanding
Of the divine forces which we have all been bestowed
It was in this search that I came upon a revelation
Which has called me to guide millions of people towards their righteous destiny

(Mike G: Outro)
A lot of kings seem def to turn queen
Mike G still remain, like a feet mix
Nigga don’t ask whose next, ask who wants to play
Living Lavish still looking for a better day
And through all the commotion there’s only one thing I can say
Good morning this is Mike G reporting for LA...

And on the seventh day...
