[Hook]
There's no way I can stop
Gunning like it's Black Ops
Everywhere I am got people on the highest watch
Cop it from the med shops
Skating on the blacktop
I would take it straight up if it was my last shot
There's no way you should stop
With one up in the stash box
And I got my top dropped to keep the game on lock
Fully automatic when I spit
But I can sweep the streets without it
Any claim they say they cleaner than me
I highly doubt it, uh

[Verse 1]
Come and get it if you need your supply
She's exotic, I like 'em live
Green in both of our eyes
See I grind so I can find the best method of rhyme
That leads to gaining even better ways to arrive
Once you get the vehicles then you get to drive
Then you bring the honeys in like bees to a hive
But you balled up when you get caught up in somebody's web of lies
Some are even foolish enough to believe that heat doesn't rise
Real eyes realize lies and see through disguises
Other clowns are like Jack in the box with no surprise
"How you riding?" life is savage
But i'm pretty clean if you askin
Like women proper but there's no point in class if you ain't passin
Catching flicks from Brick or Sagan
Taking pictures with different women in many different places can cause conflict in relations
Went from loitering and skating to trips for more than vacations
But anything that's done well can tend to raise the stakes
And that's where I'm aiming

[Hook]
Gunning like it's Black Ops
Everywhere I am got people on the highest watch
Cop it from the med shops
Skating on the blacktop
I would take it straight up if it was my last shot
There's no way you should stop
With one up in the stash box
And I got my top dropped to keep the game on lock
Fully automatic when I spit
But I can sweep the streets without it
Any claim they say they cleaner than me
I highly doubt it, uh

[Verse 2]
Come and get it if you think you could hang
You could get four flats trying to speed through my lane
It's all a game and things change, I'm aware
People will claim that they're there
When grind time comes around, they vanish in thin air
It's nothing new but histerical, how most think, it's unberible
Honestly they're all too impared to teach
And it's shameful ain't it?
I hate it, I stress with the strongest language
Repeat it and replay it, chop-chop it and fade it
No matter whatever ratings, you should have my pictures hanging
Everyone's style is so basic, I wish that I could erase it
I wish that I could take off, I need you to give me space
And I'm not impressed much less amused with things that these rappers saying
So I use you for entertainment as you've been properly named
Hope your attitude ain't contagious, a disease that needs to be tamed
Been sick since I had begun
Dope, I bring in a ton
Hope you see it as fun
Joke, but don't see me as one

[Hook x2]

There's no way I can stop
Gunning like it's Black Ops
