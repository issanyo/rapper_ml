[Verse 1: Speak!]
I never follow them trends
I never follow my friends
I only follow myself
While I was gettin' my ends
Benjamins or whatever that means
I might go slip her a pill
She might go slip out them jeans
Honey go and show your [?] face
Fat ass, thin waist
Dancin' on the table
Like your dignity was misplaced
Missplelled with a "z" at the end
Once them panties go off
You'll never see me again
See me dapperin' in pea coat
Struttin' like a peacock
See the watch that he got sellin', fuck that ain't no G-Shock
Presidental Rolex, diamond studded Casio
Calculating numbers with a couple drug runners yo
Stoop kid never left his stoop, 'til he got enough dough
To go and buy him a coup
If you ain't talkin' 'bout loot, go ahead and keep it on mute
I'm ballin' out Popeyes in my three piece suit right
I'll take a two piece, fries and a biscuit
Here today, gone tomorrow
Blink and you'll miss it
I'm from a different world, and I'm only here to visit
So you got to let me probe if you want to come and kick it

[Hook 1: Syd and "Speak!"]
I like to ride that ferris wheel
[?]
I liked you better when your eyes were closed
"It don't get better much better than this"
I suppose
"It can't get much worse than this"
I suppose
"It don't get much better than this"
I suppose
"No"
I suppose, I suppose

[Verse 2: Mike G]
Now I'm asking, "Where do we go?"
Don't, stay for whole episodes
We finishing shows but
The way my schedule goes I won't see you 'till next season
I can tell she believes I keep her for various reasons
And if, she doesn't write at night
I tell you what you like in fights
I might tell her she's right
I have six reasons to leave her
I choose the rolls of a dice, so you have to play your part
Cause you should be captured in [?] and they look better in the dark
Conflict sets us apart, so I'd rather not start
Flow propane from flames if our hearts might spark
And candles are only lit so we can see where we walk
Because she [?], I love it when she talk that talk
I feel great, you should too
You work to deserve it
So the cost might add up if you show me that you worth it
We copped our [?]
And when we down South, we chop and blaze or on the interstate
Gold grills, Versace shades

[Hook 2: Syd and "Speak!"]
I like to ride that ferris wheel
[?]
I liked you better when your eyes were closed
"It don't get better much better than this"
I suppose
"It can't get much worse than this"
I suppose
"It don't get much better than this"
I suppose
"No"
I suppose, I suppose
