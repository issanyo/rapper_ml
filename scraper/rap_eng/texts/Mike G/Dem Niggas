[Verse 1: Fre$h Fadel]
Them niggas ain't your dogs
Them niggas just them niggas, that's all
Don't confuse all that smiling with good intentions and real care
Cause when you down, tell me is them niggas still there
So naw them niggas ain't your friends, naw them niggas [?]
Them niggas want the Benz, naw them niggas on a trend
The one's that really there for you start to thinking thin
Why these niggas hanging with you only when the shit is slim
You like how they in the streets, where that shit is getting them
In a cell somewhere where you can fit right in with them
And we know your ass ain't built, we just let you fade the funk
When you going through your shit, man them niggas never come
So them niggas ain't your homies, them niggas dying is slowly
And you gon' be dying with 'em if you keep on riding for 'em
Them niggas don't give a fuck about your well being
Yeah you best be ganging bang or you'll get [?] seeing

[Hook: Fre$h Fadel]
Man, these niggas don't care bout you
I don't so fuck you too, fuck you too
(Nigga fuck you too, my nigga fuck you)
Man, these niggas don't care bout you
And I don't so fuck you too, fuck you too
(Nigga fuck you too, my nigga fuck you)

[Verse 2: Mike G]
I see people come and go
I seen ships sink slowly
I know bitches that wanna hold me, treat me as one and only
Them bitches be persistent on a real nigga dick
For 25 hours, 366
I work eight days a week, it don't pay to sleep
Rolling in red Jeeps, shots of Hennessy
Them niggas can't see me
Yo Fre$h, holla at some hoes
Tell the baddest bitch I'm in room 323
Them niggas over there taking shots at a player
Chilling in my lair, put one in the air
Roll a bunch for mine, it's crunch time
When you're in your prime, shades on to the haters, I am blind
I remember when I was on papers only
Then I moved on how to sell like PlayStations on Sony
I listen to everything that all these people told me
Odd Future my crew for life that's why all these people know me

[Hook: Fre$h Fadel]
Man, these niggas don't care bout you
I don't so fuck you too, fuck you too
(Nigga fuck you too, my nigga fuck you)
Man, these niggas don't care bout you
And I don't so fuck you too, fuck you too
(Nigga fuck you too, my nigga fuck you)
