[Hook]

I'm seeing things others can't imagine
So I can't be one of them, I Have to be one of one
I have to be one of one
I have to be one of one

[Verse 1: Mike G]

What I have is necessary as rain in a drought, so i'll never burn out, on my run to the sun
I'll continue this until im doing triple digits, if I state the level, I'd think that these others just begun
I seek fulfillment from my visions
Pay no attention to opposition or resistance
It seems people keep forgetting nothings given
You may find me looking like my concern is missing
It's hard to be in the place im getting to
When this is your life mission
And between my friends and enemies I can't even see the difference


[Hook]

I'm seeing things others can't imagine
So I can't be one of them, I Have to be one of one
I have to be one of one
I have to be one of one

[Verse 2]
I hope you figure it out, like that old game show
Mike got a presance you can't capture in photos
But, if you're with the goal, Its a go, we can roll
Wheels ain't falling off cuz my hearts made of gold
