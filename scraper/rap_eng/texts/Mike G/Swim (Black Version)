I put it down, on the track. Let it run, keep it going
Shawty cold, I mean arctic. Jack Frost, keep it snowing
You see me, say keep rollin'. Seven seas, i'm exploring
How you doing? Where we going? Say goodnight, then good morning, Like

Said It's only good evenings now
No conversation like we got nothing to speak about
Can tell by how you're breathing now
It's late but I ain't leaving now
I'm on the team you're cheering for, how I got you screaming out
Thinkin' bout, you gaining pleasure in an obscene amount
No matter if it's winter or weather from storms or a drought
My conditioning is for the distance theirs is running out
Use your eyes before your mouth, watch who you speakin' bout
Nothing to hide, but we don't want no secrets leaking out
And unless you down to ride, a seat shouldn't be what you seeking out
I'm a soldier like a marine, but let's take it deeper now
I'm a boss, give you that work that you keep singing bout
We can go to my place, close the door. Girl it's your's
You the best, you deserve all applause and awards
Give it up, give me more. From the bed to the floor
And every place in-between like we're going on tour

I put it down, on the track. Let it run, keep it going
Shawty cold, I mean arctic. Jack Frost, keep it snowing
You see me, say keep rollin'. Seven seas, i'm exploring
How you doing? Where we going? Say goodnight, then good morning, Like
I put it down, on the track. Let it run, keep it going
Shawty cold, I mean arctic. Jack Frost, keep it snowing
You see me, say keep rollin'. Seven seas, i'm exploring
How you doing? Where we going? Say goodnight, then good morning, Like

I'll be more than a friend. Where do we begin again
Imma make this clearer than superman's vision is see
I'll be patient. Don't keep me waiting for nothin'
When we roll, or coast, just hold on to something
This my job baby, i'll give a hundred the whole time
Swing you to my place from the club, give you the whole 9
You're so blind. They don't even support you for real
I'm behind you, all the way in. Now tell me how it feels
You say that it's real. Can you prove it though?
Everything but time to kill, and still we're moving slow?
If you ain't know, I'm the closest thing to Romeo
Ain't no acting or playing, I don't care how you fit the role
Dressed as an angel, I ain't got time for faking though
I'd call you a jewel and yet, you just try to match my glow
I ain't flawless and I have to tip my cap, you let it go
But i'd call you a jewel and yet, you can't see what's set in stone?

I put it down, on the track. Let it run, keep it going
Shawty cold, I mean arctic. Jack Frost, keep it snowing
You see me, say keep rollin'. Seven seas, i'm exploring
How you doing? Where we going? Say goodnight, then good morning, Like

Said your presence is so divine, and you're so rare to find
Would you swim through my mind just one more time?
It's like watching stars align, gorgeous you redefine
Would you swim through my mind just one more time?
Said your presence is so divine, and you're so rare to find
Would you swim through my mind just one more time?
It's like watching stars align, gorgeous you redefine
Would you swim through my mind just one more time?
