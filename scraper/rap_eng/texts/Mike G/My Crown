[Intro: Sizzla]
They can't keep a good man down
Always keep a smile when they want me to frowns
Keep the vibes and they stood my grounds
They will never ever take my crown
They will never ever take my crown
They will never ever take my crown

[Verse: 1]
Since I'm dressed to kill, I'm livin in sin
And anyone that murders once will probably do it again
I only do most things because I say that I would
These rappers drowning in lies sayin they shit is good
Well they better learn to swim as well as Frank sang
They listen to my 12 inch speakers go BANG
My style is black flame, My hold on the game
Is so insane, So deranged that I should be constrained
I'm talking to you when I say lets make it through
You see my eyes on oceans and skies blue, I'm floating
If its gold I'll probably hold it
Vintage, they'd say its old
If its green I'll probably break it down roll it and blow it
Holding controllers, I'm just hoping hate don't ruin my moments
I do it for those to get excited for tracks when I'm on it
Go so extensive, a new chronicle Riddick
My 6th sense can make fakeness do a 180 pivot
You got issues just forget it
I'm probably the sickest, If you with it then I'm with it
I'm smoking in rememberance of anyone who's ever contented
Respect opinion not a critic
I get paid by the minute, appearance and the sentence
Give me a second man I'mma get it

[Verse: 2]
I'm so chill as the shade my ladies lay in
And now I'm at the point where i'd rather never spend a day in
I still here them talk but I don't know what they saying
Throwin' hands up to the fans in the stands waiting patient
It's who and what you know, I'm getting gaining pace off relations
This game is combat I'm throwing lightning like Raiden
The infinite supreme ruler, got more gems then jewelers
Now I live to be this cool I wish could have done it sooner
Follow your passion you never know what it's gonna get you
And I hardly play on stations but that's not really an issue
Yet to find something as precious as my time
When I arrive about as high as rates for New York crime
Ring the alarm when I come through
And clear a path my wolf gang crew came too
And if you ask I never wanna say we came close
Success for everyone is something that I want most
Let's make a toast

[Outro]
Uhh, yeah, Mike G
Yeah, yeah, see me
Uh
Fucking radical
Wolf gang shit now we after you
