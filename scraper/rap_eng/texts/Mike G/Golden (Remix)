I don't need classification [?]
I can show you how to make the block hot as a stove top
Keep it on lock, six rounds of shots
Baby, where you aiming? Lady where your brain is
Excuse me miss, I have no time to play with
[?] I got game that'll leave you confused
I mean I'm so [?] I might switch continents just to get a new view
I need to be so fly when I leave the spot
I can hop off the roof
I need to be dressed so official could make a soldier salute
I just need [?] with the least amount of clothes
[?] and that's real nigga sit
My spaceship could take you to heights that couldn't hit
Enough to make you forget things you shouldn't miss
[?]down to take part sit back and witness
They gave me a running start, I'm passing the finishing line
I'm wondering how she got so fine
[?] get better with time
