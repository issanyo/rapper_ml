[Verse 1: Mike G]
Uh, Yeah
Now I dont mean to be rude
The way I talk you gon have to excuse my mood
I ain't gon switch, you should really be used to it
I be on that fly shit, they say he Slick as Rick
Im bringing the corner back, a (?) like (?)
Making moves so right the whole flight can't be wrong
Seeing things at night that I can only express in songs
See why I say that we (?), kings like Leon
Solo (?) low, i'll get you to school
Why I don't be with my dogs like Turner and hoops
All his time that he spend he dont spend with his friends
Only I can comprehend the mind state I be in
Im just trying to give you something you can feel like (?)
And everybody know it like the subway song, I get it in
Get it in for the dough like John
And I'mma do it like this till im gone

[Course: Mylo X]
Yep, Its the daily routine
We not doing the same things
No matter what it seems
Like, cause this the daily routine
You might see ime with my team;
Kings amongst kings

[Verse 2: Mylo X]
Mike told me to kill this track
But you'll be lucky if I dont kill you
I feel sorry for the old lady that lived in my shoe
Cause I stepped in it, stomped all around
Jumped all around like a crunk clown
But didn't bring it down
I'll take you up to my infinite story
It's gettin glory, this is how it is 24, 7
Uh, and from the looks of things
No time soon will I be seein any new same
You know the deal, my hood is a shootin range
For young kids (?) (?), admirin gangs
Im insane in the membrane
Weird, im still, ill
You know we chill as we entertain
Pain stuck in my heart, broken like
Every other every other day
No play, foul play, yo hey
Party in the place, see the expression on my face
Ill is what im laced with

[Course: Mylo X]
Yep, Its the daily routine
We not doing the same things
No matter what it seems
Like, cause this the daily routine
You might see ime with my team;
Kings amongst kings
