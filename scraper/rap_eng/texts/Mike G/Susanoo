[Verse 1: Mike G]
I'm a product of, real love
Drinks, and concentrated drugs
Rock star lifestyle. Awake before the sun is up
Run it up, Bow in the presence of a legend
When i speak , take a second listen without interjection
Pay attention , you might even catch it like an interception
Presidential, smoking something that doesn't need an election
You remember me? The man that taught you , you could conquer anything?
Speed in the coupe, it's Sonic blue
Running through the spinning rings
Concentrate on how you breath, So good i could fly through trees...
Now don't even speak to me
Just informally, *bow bow* like you Japanese
I can take you to the top of every single mountain peek
Envious can stay green and lean on their dreams
I'm a fiend, I feel i could defeat a whole team
Bow in the presence of a king
California dream, 2016 James Dean
