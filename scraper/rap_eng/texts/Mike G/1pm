Verse 1:
My music can get you high like limitless elevators
If presance could sing songs I'd sound like smooth operator
I'm the King, make 'em bow down
I need more cheese than rat's playhouses
You allow your child to run around
The clock keeps ticking but I keep hitting
To do numbers like GTA I'm running midday missions
How can they contend they wish they could be and have my friends
There's somedays when we ain't getting in till 1pm
Lames must be invisible I don't see them
Ironically, we're as invincible as any legend
And my lesson in them was idolize no other men
Because you're only a hero if there's a win in the end
Starting journeys, of course the hardest step is to begin
I left the bottom where it's at, never plan to meet again

Hook:
For those times when you knew everything but what to do
But now look at you, you still made it through
It seems like you know everywhere but where to go
You don't get younger you grow, don't hide your pride you let it show
It's all you, you can't lose
Don't nothing sound better than the truth
You get your paper then you stack it to the roof
It's all you, you can't lose

Verse 2:
Yo you're dealing with a hostile who's more than a novice
The way I see since I started I have this game in my pocket
Boy I operate off more than confidence, stomping
I'm hopping over the nonsense I'm presented with
It disturbs my conscience, inconsiderate
Don't you know I need it to live?
And all I take is time, but I've got so much to give
All it takes is a rhyme I could make a whole crowd flip
Fix your outfits I'll make you fire your stlyist
I'm wild sick, however fowl the fowlest is
Rude boy I might be banned from colleges
Holler if you about Dollars, cents, Yen, Euros
Or what ever language we could call it in
Got you feeling like it can takes a million years to win
For all my makers that made it man this cheers to them
And Kings and Queens if you're on the way I'd like to commend
If you're moving backwards I hope listening helps you ascend

Hook
