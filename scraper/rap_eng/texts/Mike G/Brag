[Verse 1: Mike G]
I ran the streets like when I used to loop up beats
I’m all models and singers asking me when we’re gonna meet
I’m so unique, just see that you can’t see me
Break rules, believe and see
That I’m you times three
And me?
Well there’s no other, like me on the earth
From what I seen and heard I can captivate with words
This is more than rap
Each breath says, "nigga, what you got on that?"
Every step is a fact, every minute I put in it
It improves every sentence
Your reign ends with this period there is no point
In my spare time I roll up joints
Pin things together well boss, get joint in, check this
I’m looking for the future, going to the moon
Looking for new one to make her want to join me to my room
Don’t mean to boast but damned if I don't brag
Bitch, try to keep up and maybe we can last
Nigga better speak up, you hide behind a mask
It's no debate that hate'll get you nowhere fast
But you run it in quicker than a hundred yard dash
Drivin' with your eyes closed foot on the gas, yo
What’s the difference between me and you?
You feel you shining like the sun, I’m what the world wakes up to
When it’s dark I illuminate entire rooms
I’m so in tune yo, that at night I glow
Got myself like I've taken these steps before
You are now fucking with a professional
