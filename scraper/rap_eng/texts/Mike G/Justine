[Intro]

[Hook: Tommy Swisher]
Baby run this way, can you run this was
I just need  new escape
Baby brighten my day
Help me keep the faith
I need you, I need you

[Verse 1: Tommy Swisher]
She could be the one, one
I don't even know her name though
Finest girl in the city
And she push a new Range Rover
Smoke dope all day
Cause she got it like that, like that, like that
She ain't fucking with you niggas, she don't ever call back
And she keep that strap
Everything on fleek
Hope one day we meet and have sex on the beach
Sip [?] toast toast living the moments
These are the moments baby
I been on it, I been zoning
And I been living all kinds of crazy I know
But fuck that shit, don't judge me
I know if you get to know me, you'll probably love me

[Hook: Tommy Swisher]

[Verse 2: Mike G]
I see what you're into, it's different
Know them other chicks may say the same
And it's not cause the difference is I meant it
I'm watching your slow motion sprint to the finish
You're 100 percent authentic
Without you my mood would be low as a note from the tenors
You know, the singers? Would say this in ways so you wouldn't forget it
You get it
Occasions momentous like summer Olympics
My passion for this burns hotter than tempers
I hope you not social with them dudes in comments of pictures you post, I'm known to go postal
You know I'm on from coast to coast
You should know I have many things to show you
People always say they always want get to know you
But they don't know half of what you go through
I only seek to improve
If I had the world, I'd split it in two
Trips for nothing more than a view
I love how you came out of the blue
You know the throne's reserved for a few
I got more than something to do
I got a coupe, that's seated for two
That means it's just me and you

[Hook: Tommy Swisher]
