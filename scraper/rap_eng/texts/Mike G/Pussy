[Hook]
Why you put it on me like that?
Had it hard for me to fight back
Slow it down for me mami
What's up? Can you find me?
Why you put it on me like that?
Really thought that you was my match
Now you lost in the flow
So gone, where you go?

[Verse 1: Mike G]
You know the truth baby, It's me and you baby
All I've been thinking's what i'm trynna do
Lately, you've been than captivating
More than too evasive, more than you would think
Girl i'm more than a player seeking new relations
Though I ain't got the mind for time wasting
When i'm with you I leave calls waiting
Looking in your eyes is like stargazing
Got my crew with me, gone get your friend's
Pretty, smart, with her own dividends. That's a ten
Pull up, Cool Breeze then I'm gone with the wind
It's a west side story when Santana sing, like

[Hook]
Why you put it on me like that?
Had it hard for me to fight back
Slow it down for me mami
What's up? Can you find me?
Why you put it on me like that?
Really thought that you was my match
Now you lost in the flow
So gone, where you go?

[Verse 2: Santana Ali]
She wanna fuck with a nigga (She gon fuck with a nigga)
She gon fuck but it ain't nothin
Cranberry with the stuffing
No discussion (No talk, no talk)
She gon, she gon, she gon buss it
She gon, she gon, she gon buss it
She gon buss it, no concussion
Know she love it no assumption
She calling me she calling me, she calling i'm not home
She calling me she asking me who hair all in my comb
A part of me, a part of me saying leave that bitch alone
Raining all on my party. Baby please dont start it, now
Pardon, pardon
Pardon, pardon

[Hook]
Why you put it on me like that?
Had it hard for me to fight back
Slow it down for me mami
What's up? Can you find me?
Why you put it on me like that?
Really thought that you was my match
Now you lost in the flow
So gone, where you go?

[Bridge: Santana Ali]
So fast, don't crash
You know, your task
You know your needs
If you got no one got me
No path, won't last
You know, your task
You know your needs
If you got no one got me, yeah

[Outro: Mike G]
This a heavy tune, with a slight groove
You should get involved cuz I like you
Gotta mean stroke game. I'm a nice dude
Every bar cold, I can make the price move
Shawty bad to the bone like the Lench Mob
But she so cold, that's Ice Cube
I stay so in tune with you
That i'm walking on the moon
I move how Mike move
It's a heavy tune, with a slight groove
You should get involved cuz I like you
Gotta mean stroke game. I'm a nice dude
Every bar cold, I can make the price move
Shawty bad to the bone like the Lynch Mob
But she so cold, that's Ice Cube
I get so in tune with you
That i'm walking on the moon
I move how Mike move
