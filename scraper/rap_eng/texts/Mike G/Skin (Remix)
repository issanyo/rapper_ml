Verse 1:
The mood is set
(ha ha)
So you already know what's next
(uh huh ah)
TV on blast
Turn it down
Turn it down
Don't want it to clash
With my body screaming out
(no-o-o)
I know you hearin' it
(hu-u-uh)
You got me moanin' now
I got a secret that I wanna show you, oh
I got a Secrets I'mma drop em to the floor, oh

Hook:
No teasin'
You waited long enough
Go deep
I'mma throw it at you
Can't catch it
Don't hold back
You know I like it rough
Know I'm feelin' you, huh
Know you liking it, huh

Chorus:
So why you standin' over there witcha clothes on
Baby strip down for me
Go on take em off
Don't worry baby
I'mma meet you half way
Cause I know you wanna see me

Mike G:
It's only good evenings now
She tellin' me she needs me, can tell by how she's breathing
Late but I ain't leaving, got more than what you're seeing
Ignore what ya heard i'll give you something to believe in
You see how I'm on ya, even if for the moment
Her foresight is good with this Odd-Futurama
She got her own mantra, I figured that we're past just cool
Call me a team player cuz stopping is against the rules, right?
She sayin this is flight. They don't know what it's like
I'm sure they wanna know, even if for a night
I'm better than her others. Is she better than them girls?
Cause "best I ever had" doesn't mean best in the world
She paused... Cause that made her say please don't doubt me
Know she want this forever I ain't talkin bout a spouse
It's just us in the house, so the evidence was out
That she was in a drought and couldn't do this without me

Chorus 2:
No heels,No shirt,No skirt
All I'm in is just skin
No jeans,Take em off
Wanna feel your skin
You a beast, oh
You know that I like that
(your skin)
Come here baby
All I wanna see you in is just skin
(o-o-oh oh oh oh your skin)
(o-o-oh oh oh oh just skin)
(o-o-oh uh oh oh im lovin your skin)
(oh oh)

Bridge:
All in baby
Don't hold nothing back
Wanna take control
Ain Nothing wrong with that
Say you likin' how I'm feelin'
Gotta tell me that
Just put your skin baby on my skin

Chorus 2 (2x):
No heels, No shirt, No skirt
All I'm in is just skin
No jeans,Take em off
Wanna feel your skin
You a beast, oh
You know that I like that
Come on baby
All I wanna see you in is just skin

All I wanna see you in is just skin
All I wanna see you in is just skin
Oooh
All I wanna see you in
All I wanna see you in is your skin, oh
