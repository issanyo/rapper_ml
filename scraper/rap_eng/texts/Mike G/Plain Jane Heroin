[Verse 1]
There's a stain upon the couch
From where I tried to get you high
There’s a bruise upon my leg again
I thought we were makin’ love
But you were stickin' it in my thigh
Now I can't feel my face again

[Chorus]
I'm hooked on the Plain Jane Heroin
I'm hooked on the Plain Jane Heroin
I will never be the same
Without you, Jane
And your heroin

[Verse 2]
I thought I could dabble with you
Once or twice a week
Yeah, I was in control of it
But now I'm swaying backwards
With no shoes upon my feet
And I can’t keep a hold of it

[Chorus]
I'm hooked on the Plain Jane Heroin
I'm hooked on the Plain Jane Heroin
I will never be the same
Without you, Jane
And your heroin

[Bridge]
Oh, I tried to mess with Mary just to get Jane off my mind
But all it did was make the pain get worse
Medicate the symptom and you'll never solve the crime
'Till you pick yourself up off the floor

[Verse 3]
Twenty-eight months sober
And the days are all the same
The sun goes up and down again
But when I think about the way
She felt inside my veins
I get bags under my eyes again

[Chorus]
I'm hooked on the Plain Jane Heroin
I'm hooked on the Plain Jane Heroin
I will never be the same
Without you, Jane
And your heroin

[Outro]
Oh Jane, oh Jane
I’ll never be the same
Oh Jane, yeah yeah
Oh woah
Plain Jane heroin
I'm hooked on the Plain Jane Heroin
Plain Jane heroin
I'm hooked on the Plain Jane Heroin
