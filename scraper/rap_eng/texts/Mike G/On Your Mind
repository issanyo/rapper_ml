[Verse 1]
I been on the road so long I can hear home callin'
You on my mind more than often, more than unsolved problems
You on my mind like a song you wake up singin in the morning
Seeking solace keep the mantra going til we reach nirvana
Ain't no silence wear your heart and show it out with all your pride
But keep quiet about all the things that we do in private
I wish We had more time cuz I got much more to say
I've been gone for a hundred days a thousand miles away
I could sing this song a hundred ways to get a million plays
Over fires blazin hoping hell ain't as hot as where I stay
Wild and untamed you can't contain this inside a cage
Build this from the ground up, stand up on it like a stage, Yeah

[Hook]

When I open my eyes I think of you and when I..
When I look outside I think of you
They gon be surprised what we can do
You don't have to hide what you can do
(What's on yo mind?)
Living like a skater on the grind
(What's on yo mind?)
Spray it just to get the whip to shine
(What's on yo mind?)
We can make it baby give it time
(What's on yo mind?)
If you feel it you should press rewind
(I'm on yo mind)

[Verse 2]
This is more than music see you're more than a muse to me
More than entertainment used for more than amusement believe
More than what you asking for
Like what two and two would bring
Living life like make believe, flying when we want to
Air might get too hard to breathe and hard to see in front of you
We might move into trees with everything we growin through
I come through with the coldest view To give something to hold onto
Know we overdue we can go overtime if you want to
Night time now is normally something that you look forward too
Life changes when you do what you said you were going to
Dont ask what son gon do. Cuz you know he gone shine
Read it fast like road signs. My mind is a gold mine. And I'm...


[Hook]

When I open my eyes I think of you and when I..
When I look outside I think of you
They gon be surprised what we can do
You don't have to hide what you can do
(What's on yo mind?)
Living like a skater on the grind
(What's on yo mind?)
Spray it just to get the whip to shine
(What's on yo mind?)
We can make it baby give it time
(What's on yo mind?)
If you feel it you should press rewind
(I'm on yo mind)
