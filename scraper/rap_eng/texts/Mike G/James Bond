[Intro]
Mike G, Wolf Gang

[Verse 1]
I only stay to fly to grab what's beyond my reach
My dreams make me feel like I'm worthy of king like speech
I treat rhyming like I was hired by designers to create
The biggest building that can withstand fires, floods
And whatever terrorist or hitman for hire, I'll take us higher
You can put your trust in me, I'll be relief
So to speak, give me instruction, make it brief
So I can hit the streets and my price will increase
Of course I step outside the lines, you give me the rules
I can repair things to new, just give me the tools
I'll stuff my car with as many gadgets as I can fit in here
Riding until my tires burn out, it's been a good year
I dedicate my time to this with all I have to give
They should create a series of movies on how I live
Need cameras following around my life like KIDS
So they can see how I wreak havoc and mischief

[Hook]
Aye this is fast lane living on a cash chasing mission, yo (x2)
I'm the type of person you need, I hope you aren't forgetting
This is fast lane living on a cash chasing mission (x2)
I'm the type of person you need I hope you aren't forgetting, yeah

[Verse 2]
We screaming "High life" love living in the lime light
Loitering in white clouds, I use them to sky write
We living for right now, top tier is my type
So fear, is outcasted from here with red strikes
I'm too great, that's double 0 the number before 8
Odd jobs for the cash to come in by brief case
They say the one who believes is the hardest to defeat
On foreign seas, watching my Halle Berry walk up on the beach
Mad methods due to my mental, you see what it gets me into
I see you out my peripheral, hiding may be too difficult
Insolence is an insult and remember is the principle
They say life or death. For me, it's a little more literal
In my most proper voice I plea insanity to challenge me
Execution is everything, heavily oppose referees
My wardrobe is a gallery of costumes like Halloween
Put it simply, I live more intensely than an action scene

[Hook]
