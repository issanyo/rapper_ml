[Verse 1: Mike G]
I’m going all out to say, I treat you like kids send you all out to play. I gotta handle my biz or you end up with nothing work til it’s more than enough
Man it’s really something to see everybody hustling
If you focused with no direction, it starts with self respect
And gaining the foresight to see what comes next
Follow me if you copy, see this is more than a hobby
I went overboard with confidence it’s obvious you have to get used to this
I’m a symbol of love to women like Cupid is
Shooting through the hoops you miss
I know the new outlaws and they stay in saloons
I roll with Japanese broads all bad as sailor moon
I just want what I’m worth, maybe more nothing less
And it's green for the money real niggas know the rest
I learned you Accept
My crew exceptional with no exemption, I know what to expect
If you don’t listen then it’s written
Vintage jewelry give history lessons
Lookin' at these Greek frets on my neck
Still feeling odd bout these texts from my ex
The king come in the room and demand your respect

[Hook: Archibad Slim]
Sleeps the cousin of death but fuck if you just know the cousin
Respect me while I'm living don't be friendly cuz I'm buzzin'
You know what it is, you know I'm finna get what's comin'
Trying to get it for myself how I'm supposed to give you something?
It was written, it ain't that niggas looking at you different
It was written, niggas had to work for what they getting
It was written, took risk, we deserve it how we living
It was written,... We ain't trippin' it's gon' come cuz it was written

[Verse 2: Mike G]
I’m going all out to say I treat you like kids send you all out to play. I gotta handle my biz or you end up with nothing, still nothing is enough
And we just kick back while everybody frontin'
But man you need patience cuz of all these people hating
When all I ever stressed to you was you could be great
But still they envy, I’m fly and spinnin' lyrical 720’s
As I land stand tall as the Statue of Liberty
Make some noise clap-clap if you with me
At half speed I span half of the city
At a 100 miles an hour I can run my hometown
Tear the place down, turn the bass down just for now
I been so busy I skipped trial
Still running the streets and sticking out
I been on the top of the world screamin' look at me now

[Hook: Archibad Slim]
Sleeps the cousin of death but fuck if you just know the cousin
Respect me while I'm living don't be friendly cuz I'm buzzin'
You know what it is, you know I'm finna get what's comin'
Trying to get it for myself how I'm supposed to give you something?
It was written, it ain't that niggas looking at you different
It was written, niggas had to work for what they getting
It was written, took risk, we deserve it how we living
It was written,... We ain't trippin' it's gon' come cuz it was written

[Verse 3: Mike G]
I’ve seen sights for which people would kill
At the end of the day I need something to feel
I can deliver the deal signed and sealed
Where we go from here only time will reveal
I’ve had experiences that make life surreal
If I rap anymore ruthless it may land me in jail
If it wasn’t for music it would be hard to excel
If you think you wanna do it know you gotta do it well
