[Verse 1: Pheally Blunt]
I'm a seven squad Afro General, gorilla grizzly
With a ET finger that fuck Monica Lawinsky
Insane in the membrane, Sparking up the Rick James
Fuck who you thought I was, bitches call me big main
Deranged lunatic, suicidal sicko
Filling my prescription up at LA Confidential
Got a chronic case of needing medication for my mental state
All the psychiatric dialog couldn't penetrate
My dome, my head, my skull my cranium
Mainly cus my brain plate is laced with anti-anuim
Mediterranean herb and this cup of syrup
Might make me sta, start, sta-stuttering my words
Rippin off my shirt like I'm Hulk Hogan
Hot boxing in the Rigo and I'm claustrophobic
Plus graphic my blunts stretch like Mr. Fantastic
High off that breaking breath now puff puff pass it

[Hook: Mike G]
Im tellin you on the coast that's how we roll
Roam the streets like the cops on Patrol and stay gold
If they trip they pay a toll odd future wolf gang man we on a roll
I'm tellin you on the coast that's how we roll
Roam the streets like the cops on Patrol and stay gold
I'm telling you I'm to cold to control
You're to average to advance and I'm to hot to hold

[Verse 2: Mike G]
I can pull women at traffic lights
A color blur on turnpikes
If my shows were instructions
You'd wanna learn twice
Not one for jokes
Try not to tolerate with foolishness
180 Airs on I'm above every influence
A walking atomic bomb
Shit that I be on it borders phenomenon
Might just inspire song
Most niggas think most women are faithful
But their mostly wrong
Cus if she see's my car
She might think I'm James bond
We drink and smoke
I teach my chick to blow them O's
I can wrap up health in the street
To the studio
You know how the game goes
I just show you how to play it
Me and girls from videos
Get triple x rated
Its about the time
Ima hold the game for ransom
Materialize from my imagination like green lantern
Never panic when problems arise
I shield my eyes
Cus bright lights blind
Sometimes when I drive
So feel the vibe

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Left Brain]
This is what the west do
We put it in the air and we don't smoke no boof
Nigga this is left brain spitting in the booth
Rollin up the sticky and im sippin 100 proof
Chili cheese fritos, chilling with my people
Rolling up that og like a corn inside a burrito
Eating some chicken and waffles over there on Picos
Or I might be copping some Taco's Over at Tito's
They say every picture tells a story
Your bitch looked at mine, she can't ignore me
I dont hit her up that much but she hit me up
You know how west coast niggas is we don't give a fuck
So I'm telling you I ain't going no where
Im be up on the west till i got grey hair
Niggas know its left brain
On the mutha fuckin base, the drum the snare

[Hook]
