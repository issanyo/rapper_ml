[Verse 1]
Couldn't possibly blame me
More than I blame myself
I always thought I would shoot us out
Of any mess that we got in
And I should have kept my mouth shut
I could have been the grown-up
Surprised to see you had cut your hair
And then I really lost all of my composure out there

[Chorus]
'Cause my competitive streak runs deep
32, 33, baby, Magic and Kareem
I shouldn't have made a scene
But it's not easy seeing you playing for another team
No no no

[Verse 2]
When I was winnin' without you
I could leave you alone
Wouldn't rub it in your face
Now that I'm down when I see you around
Thinkin' how I can get you back (How can I get ya back?)
Thinkin' maybe my best days are behind me
Maybe winning and losing blinds me
A Monday morning quarterback
Said how'd you lose the only thing you had left?

[Chorus]
'Cause my competitive streak runs deep
32, 33, baby, Magic and Kareem
I shouldn't have made a scene
But it's not easy seeing you playing for another team
No no no

[Post-Chorus]
And what's the point of winning for myself if I have to lose to you?
(No no no no no no no)

[Bridge]
I still replay certain games in my head
I can remember every play
The time when we won it all
And when we gave it all away

[Chorus Variation]
'Cause my competitive streak runs deep
See my competitive streak runs deep
But what's the point of winning for myself if I have to lose to you?
'Cause my competitive streak runs deep
Baby, what's the point of winning for myself if I have to lose to you?
What's the point of winning for myself if I have to lose to you?
What's the point of winning for myself if I have to lose to you?
