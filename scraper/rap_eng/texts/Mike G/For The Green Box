No matter what color the lens is, I see all green
Niggas in the streets are first to fight like the Marines,
West coast representer, Task force killa,
Bad ass slash half lion, wolf, and gorilla
If I could then I would, drive in all lanes, no games
Imma Rockstar with Acclaim,
Insane, how I'm living running GTA missions
The only way to break the system is to use what they have against them
Check my diction, you see visions when you listen to what I write
You can hear lightning strike when I step to blue mic's
That's why everytime you see me man, I'm at my best
That's why I do it for the glory like Kanye West
You're not a real rep if you can't progress until your death
And I say "R.I.P. Proof" cause I'm pro-OF
Dropped 'Everything That's Yours', then I met Mos Def
Catch me off foreign shore's if you track my steps
Give your best cause this world will expect no less
Survival skills are slippin' if you don't expect what's next
Too vain to say, if I ask your name you should feel blessed
Like you we're extra's on set, you are just excess
Last of a dying breed, I'm here to supply your need
Trynna set new high standards of success, Mike G!
