Round 1: Madflex
Mmmmmm...
Now I don't really think you hood enough for this to begin
'Ey before we catch a case let's make a deal I won't act like I've been cripping with him
But y'all can't act like Geechi got any potential to win
His pickings been slim, and I came to grant a wish to the kid
But if it's bad blood, I regulate like an insulin pen
Before the ride down, I called this shit a cholas eyebrows
Because I knew it was a bad look when I penciled you in
What the fuck you want?
This man's a meal I got mass appeal behind me like Run The Jewels
I shoot the breeze, eulogy
Twenty-one gun salute
Buddy gone stumble through
He full of hot air get left behind for a cheque like Omar did to Pumps in Juice
Man, where my bank account?
Shit I just assume the funds withdrew
But now we got to set some discussion rules
I seen this guy
Mister "make them believe them lies"
Man I ain't bring none for you
Cause Black Lives Matter
There's no substitutes
I'm not adjustable
If you don't fuck with black dudes, I don't fuck with you
And I still don't fuck with you
Man I slap the shit out of Geechi; we working out trust issues
You don't rap
You part Tales from the Hood part Mother Goose
"I'd piss on my hand to get that residue from the gun removed"
Man fuck you dude
Man I ain't really pissing on myself
But I really know what trouble you
The scars of the fucking proof
I've taken clean head shots that did as much damage as any bullet stuck in you
And I still finish that fight till I slumped the dude
Heard his arm pop, didn't stop till a bone looked like a crumpled screw
That shit was looking like when a blunt gets chewed
What's my life like?
What's my life like?
I've lost a few to a double deuce
That's a troubleshoot
And I poured out so much liquor I could have made a pitcher of Jungle Juice
Look, I don't give a fuck
I don't give a fuck what you accustomed to
I'm combustable
I bust this fool
I have all the memories you keep on leaking from a knuckle bruise
As far as rap, nah, I ain't got much to prove
I brushed off the old guard so hard that the blush removed from Uncle Drew
Fuck this dude
Bust a move
Tonight you should have tapped out at the intro like the Huxtables
This shit could get uncomfortable
I run up on Geechi Gotti
Like fuck Geechi Gotti
It don't take a Million Dollar - man I sleep the body
Then pop money in the back of his neck like DiBiase
Till THAT money in the back of your neck gone need more change than [?]
Am I lying?
Naw, I'm a lion out here listening to sheep get cocky
At the core I put a Compton kid in a awkward position; do you need Pilates?
I know, I know, it's all American Airlines;
Take flight, I got the Eagle on me
Me, I'm just a little more chiiiill, you gotta speak to Yatchy
But I still make this motherfucking house look like I'm trying to beat Jumanji
I'm not alarmed, Geechi
Get an arm out if he can not see
They can still flag his ass down from the trunk like Creed and Rocky
Cause Apollo's trunk flag, if he can copy
Look, I don't really trust white dudes
On my mama, I don't give a fuck if Lush likes you!
They might be back there all night, acting like he's so nice
When he really kind of "ehhhh", like Keystone Lights
So miss me with it, like a Joakim Noah Free throw try
They know it take Flex to make the whole thing blow up like a mosquito bite
Public enemy
And you a public enemy but Geechi hood
Geechi ain't good if you can't trust it, don't believe the hype
Let the man rap

Round 1: Geechi Gotti
Nigga you's - first things first, class in session
Pop pop; see that's a school shooting
I'm just intro-ducing him like new students
Wait let me bring that back
Cause I already think I'm losing him
I said "pop pop" see how in the intro I put deuce in him?
Yo what up Madflex?
Don't look now but it's bout to get bad Flex
I'm talking yellow tape, white chalk if I blast Flex
A hundred shots, you'll get - nigga you seen what I did to the last Flex
Now why would you wanna flex up
Whatever you spit, you better say it with your chest up
I'm shooting, aiming for the neck up
I send niggas to the hospital year round; it ain't a check-up
I'm only here, to run a cheque up
Get my money and get the fuck on
Give me my space, I'm not one of these rappers you can touch on
But try that shit, and it's a [?] shots from a porno flick
[What that mean]
Nigga you getting bust on
Now on the real, he made the Freshman's list
{claps} Truth be told he old as hell
I ain't ever seen him choke when he smoke, so I'm pretty sure he can hold this L
I'm focused, yeah with two trays squeezing till they empty, like I'm trying to get the last out the toothpaste
Pace yourself, this ain't a sprint, this a marathon
Faceshot, let one ring cross his ear like Barry Bonds
Bonds build, and bonds break, see that's a part of life
But I'm disrespectful, I'd record a porno over whatever movie that your daughter like
Like it or not, you finna die behind bars like you got charged for playing with children
Yo Philosophy, how much did y'all pay me to kill 'em?
Don't matter, I brought my chopper, you need to know, that ain't the only K in the building
The build up crazy, but y'all be waiting for the haymakers
So y'all be missing the bars I slip in like a date raper
I hate haters, but that's a contradiction
When the chop be spitting, it hit his bitch
Cold word: Scotty Pimping
See they caught that but I thought they'd have to catch up sooner
That just meant that his bitch gone be chilling with the Future
R.I.P. Young B
It's all love so know that that bar wasn't meant with any disrespect
The culture needs you
So after this kill I'ma ask God if he could trade you for Flex
Is you upset, don't matter I'm not stopping
The Glock popping
Till he get [?] like a cop shot him
I shot him then tossed the tray like jail food
This strictly business, with no strings attached like jail shoes
I hate how he rap
That shit be having me bored Flex
I mean that shit be cool but ain't no real niggas fucking with it like a Ford Flex
I came for blood catch him in the parking lot
It's clock out time
Y'all gone think he ran out the door, when you hear Flex shot outside
Outside looking in, this was a good match
Bro stop, when the 4 cock it's cracking his shit like a dope spot
Spotlight on me, so I gotta shine
I'm on that top tier campaign of moving fast, in Columbine
I already killed my class
And when it's real you can tell, you can see it in they eyes
It's yo turn, see if you can make niggas believe them lies
Nigga time

Round 2: Madflex
Hold on
Let me sum that up
I should of held out for a Pat Stay match
Fuck that I came here to give Nelly some Band-aids back
But yo I only take Geechi if you give me paper
I need them dollars first this ain't a water birth; no free labour
Come on Geechi you wet behind the ears
At the end I could get him tapered
But why bother I've been called up from San Diego just to see some fake ass screw ball moving
Ey yo Virgina [?]
It's okay slow [?] hang over the plate
It's all [?]
Now you caught bodies
Not a single motherfucker you bodied could body me
Compare the bars, swear jar; the policy is talk is cheap
I'm flipping property, it's like I'm pissed I lost at Monopoly
Get off of me
Yeh boss these
Flex official; Ed Hochuli
I caught wind of you
And opened doors; Where's my thanks for the cross breeze?
Your whole style really easy to get lost in
It's setup bar setup bar setup bar
Then you claim Compton
But you urgent need security like Etta James talking
"I'm on the corner waiting to shoot"
Quit yelling Craig Hodges
Ey, You made yourself clear
Now you getting the cellophane coffin
PG on the ground, oh fucking well, I'm name dropping
Until everybody in the Bay watching; I'm Dwayne Johnson
I will kill this man, print him on my shirt
Hulk Hogan my shirt
Slam it on the floor and drop a big leg on it
I'll run it back
I know he's fucking strapped
Fuck him, I feel the game in my hands without a Rumble Pak
I said face plant bitch; think fake Space Jam kicks
His family staring at his stitches
Like ewww, what the fuck is that
Yeah, Shots Fired, the only reason that they dug this match
Is because they know they'd have to pull you off the ground before the face off; this a pumpkin patch
Yeah, I take more than a bit off the top
I'm in my upper class
And I ain't even in my bag yet
Madflex, more comfortable coming through San Diego than an Aztec
I break a bitch's ankle with a jab step
Tell me something other than your address and the past tense
Without another pop, round, ratchet, shell or body punch you have left
We seen all that
Just keep it rap
Or keep it wrapped up like Iraqi women
You get knocked out and wake up before you have a symptom
Facts, no fiction
Jordan doesn't pass to Pippen
And you have never shown growth on cam, my man: you Maggie Simpson
Y'all don't understand
You got this whole SoundCloud rapper look
No you can't get it shared man
Geechi how many pictures you got squatted down with the prayer hands
Ey
Yeah, yeah
Soldier feel the question
Or take a seat without a Bears fan
Fuck an arm connect you think I'm out here trying to square dance
I shall prevail
And go Latrell Sprewell because you would have to make the culture choke to even have a fair chance man
Fight back

Round 2: Geechi Gotti
Nigga you - Secondly
Secondly, don't ask me no dumb ass questions like "Cause you a Crip can you Crip walk?"
Just know I came with one of grandma's switches
See he ain't catch that: That's cause that stick talk!
The eagle, look like a big hawk
The bullets got your name on it
Put a price on his head
Get 50 sent (50 cents) to your shit like I'm trying put some change on it
Money gang, every shot close range
These punches precise like Math and Dose range
Double barrel, you better know there's more than luck in that shotgun, this ain't a Coast game
Game time, I'm aiming at whoever sitting at the throne
These top tiers don't wanna battle
I got them running from these rounds like Indiana Jones
What's really going on?
Cause they think you hot
I think you sorta nice
I mean you didn't even really want to go to war tonight
You looking at a general
Nigga those soldiers you fought was small like The Gorgonites
Great minds think alike
We don't even think the same
So many shots guarantee you he won't even drink the same
Peep the game
I told my shooters pull up and blast
We won't give a fuck who you with
Catch him driving, send bullets all through the whip
Hold up, his car'd park
But nigga it's small talk
(What that mean?)
Nigga shoot the shit
You can't run from a red dot
Put your baby momma in a head lock
Cold word: Gerber logo
(What the fuck that mean?)
Give his baby a head shot!
I done shot a lot of niggas
You probably gone be the first white boy I'ma slump
Kidnap his bitch, ducktape her lips
But keep it on the hush, cause I could catch a fed case if I get caught with this white girl in my trunk
Hold on
White boy, you's a punk
And you gotta officer's face
Y' bitch, she's a bot
I don't even ask for the top, she just offers her face
The cloth that I lace
You could never be cut from
As far as battle rap
Shit as of late, I've been on my Forrest Gump;
(What the fuck that mean?)
That's a dumb run
See, this-

[Madflex]
Gjonaj said that

[Geechi Gotti]
This gun plastic
But it's a light 40
I extended the clip
When from 8 to 24 just like Kobe
Homie they say "Gotti all gun bars, he should try something newer"
Bah! Stand over him
Last thing he heard was the Smack intro: respect the shooter!
Nigga I'm a shooter
You'll learn that if you ever come through in Compton
I shoot like this
I might even shoot like this
But you do what you want when you poppin'
But when it's real, you can see it in they eyes
His third round, see if he can make niggas believe them lies
Time!

Round 3: Madflex
Hey, you want the truth?
On the feet or on the ground I'm killlin Geech
I got a feeling that your heart don't match your ability
I know your type
Can't defend a guillotine
They start grilling me like "Stop it"
Stand it up, stick and [?]
I mean yeah, that is an option
I knock you out - I choke you out
Motherfucker you still asleep be honest
We two rounds in, you down a couple
And I won't stay bickering like old-age women
I go O.J. Simpson; I feel guilty but I show you these hands can keep me out of trouble
Say something Geechi
I'm a grown man from a cut cloth
Look in my eyes
You looking nervous until a gun's drawn
Just talking cripping
Yeah I seen it and I'm use to it
That's why I don't make jokes about you doing it
You've been through some shit
Fuck Charron
Man throw a flag where I'm from motherfuckers would shoot through it

[Geechi Gotti]
Yeah

[Madflex]
And you do that shit for a "user pic"
I said I ain't no King Of The Dot computer kid
The day I found out about the hood, I didn't Google it
I didn't choose the shit
I was born there
I didn't move to it
I didn't drive through that motherfucker on a Uber trip
Geechi I've been too legit since you was in a uterus
You knew the shit
I Facetime with race riots the same violence, you witness you see the line
I just, just
[Flex chokes]
You see the line, and redefine the same shit that you did
But anyway, fuck that
Sorry
It's okay, I'm glad you're calm about it
I Facetime, and race riot, it's the same...
I'll get it back, hold on
I said and race riot same violence you witness you see the signs believe them lies and deny what you depict
You must
You know what
It's okay, it's tough to do this cause the honesty
It's the honesty that's coming out
Check this out
I'ma give him a closer
I'll give him a closer
I don't think you a bitch or poser
But if you stood with Craig and Smokey, Lil Chris would come and kick you over
I'm sorry
I'm sorry
I still slay y'all team
Next time the trip'll double (triple double) like Draymond Green
Be running through San Diego like Natrone Means
Man I'm sorry

Round 3: Geechi Gotti
[sighs]
Man...
Nigga you's a bitch!
I'm on fire right now
This just finna add more steam
Yo, man, if I really wanted to hear a white boy preach, I'd have watched Joel Osteen!
No scheme, this just a fact
You look like when they say "White people be dressing black..."
See, he think 'cause he rapping with a black, and wear his hat to the back, that he is black
See that type of shit make me chuckle
Cause even if I beat his ass and gave him black eyes you still couldn't see our struggle
What you know about most the niggas I grew up with
They resting where I come from
Nigga dying, that's a life lesson where I come from
These niggas don't know, how hard it is, they probably wouldn't even mess with where I come from
They say life's a gamble
Well, it's gotta be Blackjack...'cause making it to 21 is a blessing where I come from
From the mud, most these niggas die young
I'm talking every day there's a new nigga meeting they death
But now there's a lot of snitches so the police be knowing who pop without a DNA test
You wanna test me
But check this out
I gotta homie that never knew his dad
See that's reality, most of the world try to hide from it
The streets raised that nigga
He said the first time he met pops he died from it
Alright fuck it, they say I rap like a lost nigga
But in real life, I done lost niggas
Ain't shit fair
Sometimes I'd be looking to the heavens
Trying to talk to God about my dead homies
But shit, the way we was living, I ain't even sure if they went there
There's a lot of pain when I rap: we call that passion. bro
Cause I come from a place where death so common that funerals became a fashion show
We're so not even worried about, or even thinking about how them murders could affect they shortys
Shit them motherfuckers be so young, they couldn't even understand it
All they see is flowers and balloons: we gotta tell them it's a birthday party
True story!
Where I'm from, there ain't no snitching, that's a big brood
I done seen niggas get killed for how they bitch move
Move for the money only, I'm a cheap skate
After this box - aye, after this kill - you're going in a box forever, like a keepsake!
For Pete's sake, you finna get the same shit I give everybody!
Them problems is not minor
This Shots Fired?
[*gun click*] shots fired!
BAH! Now bullets kissing Flex: Scott Steiner!
Big poppa pump, I'm not a chump, nor a perpetrator
Pistol-whip him, till the steel coming out his face like the Terminator
Exterminator
Guess what, nigga the real is back
They ain't even see me shoot em
But Nico heard I peeled your cap!
The real is back!
They call Gotti to check the nerds
On my block with the rocks
Something like a cop 'cause I protect and serve
But when it's real, you can tell, you can see it in they eyes
Go 'head, it's over! Hope y'all didn't believe them lies!
Nigga, time!
