[Verse 1: Coodie Breeze/Pyramid Quince]
With the slickness, I'm Matt Kenseth in a stick shift
An old school Jeff Gordon when I whip the foreign
Coming up, they want me to act act like a nigga know her
But then fuck with a nigga back when I whipped the Taurus
I spit what can't be caught in stores
Most niggas can't afford me
I know his ass don't want a feature cause he can't afford it
And they won't book me for no show cause niggas can't afford me
But heard my album coming out and niggas looking forward
Eyes on all my mirrors when steering
Niggas say we the hottest like I got fever, been chilling
See it was was hard when we started but I had faith in my niggas
Talking way in memory back when we ate remy 50s
But was coming off 40
I threw a dub cause we splitting
Started hitting these cities and seen the love we was getting
I been working shit official, need a card for my business
Cause out the mud, niggas got it
Now can God get a witness?
Uh

[Hook: Coodie Breeze/Pyramid Quince]
Can a god get a witness?
Can a god get a witness?
All these 'gars we been splittin'
All these broads we been hittin'
All this guap we been spendin'
Can a god get a witness
Can I ball with my niggas?
All these 'gars we been splittin'
All these broads we been hittin'
All this guap we been spendin'

[Verse 2: Mike G]
Black coupe, new speakers I blew sound, I move 'round
Big pay back like the new James Brown
I got that had it before you asked for it
New shoes with the blue suede on the dashboard
Only dude to lose chicks cause he can't choose
I make the news, shooting shots, skipping blocks
Hit the square on the backboard
Still smoking I, I still drink
Still on the hunt looking for some women to intoxicate
Gold never tarnished, I pray you're rich forever
The greatest hero here since Captain America
But king rules in all lands, Inglewood to Japan
Hustling, I'ma cop a coupe that look like Iron Man
Here I stand as an impeccable youth
Still wonder why this government won't tell us the truth
Still wonder why these women keep blowing up my line
In due time, you see dude shine til you're blind

[Hook: Coodie Breeze/Pyramid Quince]
Can a god get a witness?
Can a god get a witness?
All these 'gars we been splittin'
All these broads we been hittin'
All this guap we been spendin'
Can a god get a witness
Can I ball with my niggas?
All these 'gars we been splittin'
All these broads we been hittin'
All this guap we been spendin'
