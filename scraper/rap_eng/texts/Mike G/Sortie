[Verse 1: OG Maco]
'06 broke shit, quarters in my denim then
Haven't seen the field yet, I was still a citizen
Piss poor, rich dreams
'07 switched it up
Oh what a lick brings
I was selling DVDs
Pouring O's in [?]
Nokia phone, switch 'em out before the bill back
2014 might've jugged about a mil' cap
Auto mode like Optimus
Roadrunner meetings only talking if it's profiting
Forever fuck the opposites
Legend like the Loch Ness
Colder than them coffins get
I done changed the whole gang
Mind blown like Cobain
Now it's all the same thing
Dyed hair, weird name
[?] like autobond
Speeding in my own lane
Bullet train light speed
[?] how the nights be
Early where the flights leave
60K in Shanghai
Barcelona cookies Gamo
Rolling til my brain fried
Whole verse all true, I ain't told a damn lie
Big fish, big pond
Small problem, big gun
762's on the troops with the big drum
2018 movie syncs to pay the bills huh
Desperado deal huh

[Hook: Papo]
Yeah we ride out, ride out
Ooh we bout to slide
Don't try to hide now, hide now
Remember what you said
Don't lose your pride now
Because you see them semi's and them 9's out
Boy we bout to ride out, ride out, ride out
Yeah we ride out, ride out
Ooh we bout to slide
Don't try to hide now, hide now
Remember what you said
Don't lose your pride now
Because you see them semi's and them 9's out
Boy we bout to ride out, ride out, ride out

[Verse 2: Mike G]
How I do it, yeah
Stay with the business but I'm street fluent
Women was sleeping on me
And now I'm selling dreams to 'em
Director pick up your set, I get the scene moving
Gamo French inhale until we speak fluent
I was wilding when that first check hit, I was overseas
That went to a Porsche, some clothes, weed, and lawyer fees
OD hoping y'all would catch it like the common cold
Without me this whole thing would've fell apart some time ago
Paid the cost for slacking off
What made me think that was cool?
I was failing classes and my pops was teaching at the school
My shit'll never be the same
We not on the same page
Long hair, real name
Went to Crenshaw and Audobon
Niggas robbing Rolex chains
My side kick got better aim
We broke down the whole thing
From whatever we brought inside
They shot big homie D Money, he had to white G35
And we strive to survive knowing we won't leave alive

[Hook: Papo]
Yeah we ride out, ride out
Ooh we bout to slide
Don't try to hide now, hide now
Remember what you said
Don't lose your pride now
Because you see them semi's and them 9's out
Boy we bout to ride out, ride out, ride out
Yeah we ride out, ride out
Ooh we bout to slide
Don't try to hide now, hide now
Remember what you said
Don't lose your pride now
Because you see them semi's and them 9's out
Boy we bout to ride out, ride out, ride out
