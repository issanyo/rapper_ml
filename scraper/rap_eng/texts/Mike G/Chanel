Our life's a passionate pursuit I know she better be worth it
I don't keep too many cus I don't feel like they deserve it
There you have it, I'm savage Excuse me where are my manners?
Yo she fine, look like designs from the mind of Ruth Handler
I love you when you don't speak, you're so far beyond my reach
They don't even compete, you need to get 'em out they seats
Since (your) attire acquired for every occasions amazin'
Applause isn't enough you deserve standin' ovations
With hopes that dips through traffic or makes you go ecstatic no
Need to hold you back, if you want it you should grab it
I got what you need. If you say others can't have it
We'll remain this close if you don't get too dramatic
Say what you may, your infatuation will get you through the day
But it's conflicting if they don't appreciate what you say
But you're so very indecisive even if there's only one way
I'm hopin' I get her someday as she's walkin' down the runway
I'm guessin' it was the way you were steppin'
It was the cause and effect I gained a slight obsession
Don't think its rare at all
Cus you were built to perfection after all
So what less could you expect?
You can blame how you were born, You're so far beyond the norm - al
All I really want is you in your purest form
The most beautiful rose might even have the most thorns
But I'm guessin' her ex men couldn't whether the storm
Too often you're with women hoping they might consent
For what it's worth you could've turned it into time well spent
But I'll never judge another without full knowledge of the situation
In this race I place in Porsche design briefcases
What she's laced in is perfect for this present situation
If they're worth it I send them in like expensive rebates
The lights flash more but never cover your face
The way they talk has got to be a favorite accusation
'Til you start to regret it every minute you're in it
Since you feel like it something like it could've been prevented
With one missed connection or if you said the wrong sentence
To the right person you still could be workin' for them
But 9 to 5 wasn't your first choice
Now they admire you it's like your presence is your only voice
So could you live without it?
Remember when you were doubted
The quietest person's persistence in this sense can speak the loudest
And I know how it feels, they think you're something you're not
But somethings missing in them. You give it all that you got
You feel what more could I do? Maybe they don't understand
Ignorance is bliss, so happiness can go hand in hand
That's how I feel we should be, you see I know what you need
International. This a different type of air that we breathe
I told you I wouldn't leave I never said you could stay
Only path to choose is forward I can show you the way
But it'll never be easy, but I think you're a ten
So way I see it the system is designed for us to win
So points goes to those who rhyme, Whose minds are ahead of their time
And we only chase women who drink fine wine
But it doesn't really matter, we don't take them out to dine
But we stuff joints I put more in mine
Man we supposed to shine
As we cross the borderline, clock stikes 2:59
