Dreams of Chanel, Robyn, and Christine
Feel like anything I achieve would be more than I receive
They don't teach the fabric of life, how you fold at the seams
Hustle to get everything by any and all means
Energy only exists if enthusiasm's fed
They love you the most when they can use you to get ahead
Who am I to preach lessons? Now they second guess 'em
When they see who spits the best they shouldn't question my profession
Teach you I'm the professor
Don't question the method is what
Earl said to me when I dropped Mike Check
And that made me a soldier
So I'm stepping till my death In California's hottest desert
Bape camo on my weapon
Fuck ammo; I spit bullets and bars that nobody can handle
Anything you heard before this was a sample
And I reload quicker than the others
With songs, verses, and covers so I do this in my slumber
We are a bunch of others, Wolf Gang hunters
Don't take from us cuz we find niggas like Four Brothers
I figured I would be what the game was missing
Went from call of duty missions to the center of attention
The others took their careers and ran them to the ground
So doubters should always be the first people you let down
Think it's easy, might be with advice but naw
Mike G site me as philosopher, Or Moracular
Trynna get my pockets full, remind me of Carrie how we laugh at ya'll
It's me and my team back says my name
Bitches running full court if the like to play games
Appreciate my patience, eyes where I'm aiming
Love notes to redheads thank you letters to Damien
I remember conversations like what if we don't make it?
Now we travel to different countries feeling greater than the lakes
It doesn't matter what they rate us and strive off hate
I learned to love it, seems like I get so much of it
Any time spent waiting is time spent wasted
Giving in is complicated I hardly understand basic
A sinners mind is a sanctum, I'm essential to your mental
Gun to the game's temple, then I drove it like a rental
Why do I never complain about how they never mention me
When I spit degrees over any simplistic symphony
More complex than architects with any amount of layers
Life's a video game I'm controlled by the best player
Thats why it's fuck the rest unless they treat us with respect
All black with blank checks I am racer x
Not the one to lose, failure is always an option just never the one I choose
Friends will watch you go down easier than the bitches you kiss...
That's why I say fuck it life's lame and there's no moment's more important than the ones you miss
I hope this makes any senseâ€¦
Nah, I hope you listen to this
