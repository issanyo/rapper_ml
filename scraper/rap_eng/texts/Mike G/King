[Verse 1]
Nothing but Rage in my entity
A page for a symphony
Still a fuckin' Firestarter
Lighters ain't on this degree
My Shining will never stop
Fuck runnin' from every cop
Wait 'til the sun goes down
And have a showdown out in Salem's Lot
Still workin' the Night Shift, I am the Doorway
Golf clubs for violence, this a different kinda foreplay
Sometimes they come back, sometimes they don't
And sometimes I give a fuck, but most times I won't
And I think sometimes I'm made to sin
Beat them 'til the broom is bent
Take a trip and add it to the bodies out in Chamberlain
The Lawnmower Man couldn't see all the holes I dug
Rifles on my back like I'm some fuckin' kinda soldier bro

[Hook]
I'm the Devil
Nickname my Fury Christine
See me through the Mist
I'm a motherfuckin' King
Know the Cycle of the Werewolf
The Reverend couldn't see him
Through the Mist still exist as a motherfuckin' King
I'm the Devil
If ever there was such a thing
See me through the Mist
I'm a motherfuckin' King
I know the Cycle of the Werewolf
The Reverend couldn't see him
Through the Mist still exist as a motherfuckin' King

[Verse 2]
I'm a motherfuckin' King
I'm a motherfuckin' monster
Readin' books on murder
I'm the motherfuckin' author
Tell you where we finna go
Welcome to my Creep Show
Stay out my Secret Garden
Got a Wolf named Cujo
That's guardin' it
I'm experienced, you need a starter kit
Long walk, Short Pier
Roadwork there's no clear
No air
Heard your daughter's missin'
They can't find that bitch
Nowhere, nowhere
Still lack no fear
No heart in my chest, 'cause I was born without
No heart in her chest, 'cause I took that shit out
And they can't find girl two
They said that she was lost
And they can't find me 'cause I'm duckin' the law
And still fuckin' them all
And never lovin' these broads
And never cuffin' unless I'm cuffin' them in a morgue
Say I'm twisted and demented, but murder can fascinate
White girl in a white dress and that's my prom date
Carrie

[Hook]
I'm the Devil
Nickname my Fury Christine
See me through the mist
I'm a motherfuckin' King
Know the Cycle of the Werewolf
The Reverend couldn't see him
Through the Mist still exist as a motherfuckin' King
I'm the Devil
If ever there was such a thing
See me through the Mist
I'm a motherfuckin' King
Know the Cycle of the Werewolf
The Reverend couldn't see him
Through the Mist still exist as a motherfuckin' King
I'm a motherfuckin' King
I'm a motherfuckin' King
