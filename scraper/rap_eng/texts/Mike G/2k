[Verse 2: Shake]
Hey.... today..... made 2k today
Super done, fill it up
Say your prayers, tell'em stuff
Got the cup, this is tough
Let it go, that's enough
Welcomed to the streets
We wasn't welcomed in our own homes
We ain't got the juice, so we sippin' on Patroooon
We been up for three days, fill a cup with your pain
Now we goin' crazy, now this LIFE amazing
Now I don't wanna raise it, now we makin' waves man
Now we makin' waves man
Now we makin' waves man!

Oh baby now you speakin turnin' tables
I'll catch you on the weekend if I'm Abel
Oh baby now you speakin turnin' tables
I'll catch you on the weekend if I'm Abel

To the other side, to the other side
How many times?
To the other side, to the other side
How many times?
How many tries is it gon take
Until you see that I won't break
I feel lifted for the summer
Let me be for heaven sake

If you come around again
I have to say it loud again
You must love the sound of it
You must love the sound of it
If you come around again
I have to say it loud again
You must love the sound of it
You must love the sound of it
If you come around again
I have to say it loud again
You must love the sound of it

Moma said "School called"
I wasn't showin'
Sorry momma they don't let me speak my mind
I'm a poet

This is for the kids and you know it
TOAST! TOAST! TOAST! TOAST! TOAST!
Now we toastinnnnnn'
TOAST! TOAST! TOAST!
Now we toastinnnnnn'
