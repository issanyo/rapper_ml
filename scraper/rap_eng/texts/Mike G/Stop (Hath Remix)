[Verse]
I'm a rider, take me higher
I been told you I spit fire
You keep hidin', Imma find ya'
Need my money on arrival
Crops keep bouncing, I move mountains
I got flow like water fountains
Holding gems, I got vaults of them
Imma show you what my crew's about, season summer '09
I never stop grinding, success is the only outcome I got time for
You holding me up, then you get knocked down
And thats a fact like fiction was not in my options
I need the world in my total control
Anything other can be put on hold
Shout out to my brother Pouya, yeah he cold
I made thousands tryna make gold
And now they standing in line just to hear all these rhymes
You gotta get yours, I gotta get mine
But I can snatch both if you give me the time
These checks I got on, you can't stop my shine
Talking grammys and such, you gon' pay me or what?
If anyone want we can meet in the front
[?}, I'm beyond your reach
A hazard to hold, I'm too much to touch
Know where you're going, the future is written
Focus on your mission, you fly with your visions
Apply what you listing
Cause doing that's way more effective than wishing we killed it with this one
