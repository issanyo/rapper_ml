[Verse 1]
Round one, step into the ring
I can go for blow for blow
Swing after swing
I know now this is the path I choose
Train hard, so I know I can't lose

The bell chimes, it's about that time
At the bottom of the ladder
To the top I climb
A champion in his prime
I'mma keep moving forward now the world is mine

I push 'til I can't no more
'Til I'm all out of breath and my knees hit the floor
'Til the ref calls the
Match
'Til they throw in the towel I ain't never looking back

[Hook]

Success is the key
I'mma win, that's how it's supposed to be
I know now this is made for me
I realize no sacrifice means no victory

Can't lose, won't quit
Fight 'til the end and I know I'm gonna make it
Can't stop, won't stop
No
Matter what I'mma make it to the top
Can't lose, won't quit
Fight 'til the
End and I know I'm gonna make it
Can't stop, won't stop
No matter what
I'mma make it to the top

[Verse 2]
This is it, round two
Back on the ground and I refuse to lose
No guts, no glory
I'm just starting out and this is my story
I know I've been down
But I know that I just can't hit the ground
Cause I fought so hard to get to this place
This feeling inside me I've got
To face
And only time can tell
Same for him, no more saved by the bell

I know the game is rough
But when it gets too tough I never give up

[Hook]

Success is the key
I'mma win and that's how it's supposed to be
I know now this is made for me
I realize no sacrifice means no victory

Can't lose, won't quit
Fight 'til the end and I know I'm gonna make it
Can't stop, won't stop
No
Matter what I'mma make it to the top
Can't lose, won't quit
Fight 'til the
End and I know I'm gonna make it
Can't stop, won't stop
No matter what I'mma make it to the top
