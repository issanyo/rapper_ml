[Verse 1]
I'm ready to rock, too much hop in my coupe to stop
So proud I'm one of the few to move a block
I got a problem with disobeying the rules
I cop so much they gon' put me under surveillance, watch
I'm cancerous. Guaranteed if this makes list
It's fuck what's next. You should just replay this
I want respect and much more
Like show ready cars off that show room floor
They don't compare to ours or anything you hear us play
They can't relate, I live day to day like I'm a cast away
When they say it's time for debate I must argue my case greatly
I got no time to wait because I'm steadily making people hate me
But it's not an issue
Find some money, find someone to count it with you
Now you make the calls when you ball cause' you so official

[Hook]
This is, this is, this is to you
Get ya shit scarred, fucking with my triple six squad
Countdown started now I'm ready for lift off
No one stands this tall
No one is this raw
The pay off is when you finally pay the price that's right
This is how I need life, living like highlights
Every, and all day, all night, all right

[Verse 2]
It's my commitment, That I get on the mic and rip rappers
Rakin' racks and off recitin' things, I'm cold and relentless
Smoke in my entrance, If I could carry stadium lights
They'd shine like the sun when I open my windows
Who else you know flow hotter than desert sands in Pakistan?
Promise that I'd never turn back, I took a stand
16 looking for ways out, a different man
So I couldn't take the same route, needed a different plan
I need a new view, this game needs a lesson
They haven't received in school, And that's true as royal blue
A king you could be too, You believe then you prove
But believe they come for you, and soon
If I could choose I'd be Midas without all the boundaries or rules
Then how could I lose,  I wonder why they're so confused
I know life isn't easy but don't let it get to you
It's a war zone you take every step to make it through
That's the truth

[Hook]

[Outro]
Dig deep to find the treasure you want
I'm the menace each of your societies at once
Get the your shit scarred fucking with my triple six squad
Countdown started now I'm ready for lift off
No one stands this tall
No one is this raw
The pay off is when you finally pay the price that's right
This is how I need life, living like highlights
Every, and all day, all night, all right
