[Intro]
I don't know what you been told
But I'ma tell you something bout me
I'ma grind til a nigga can't grind no more
Cause ain't shit in this world free
See life is what you make it
Just make sure that you don't fold
Cause they don't care how much you making
They just want you for your soul, hey

[Hook]
Time ticking and my fingers keep itching
I'm a young nigga chasing the doe
And if you run up disrespecting
Ain't no problem to
Leave your ass on the floor
Ain't got time for these niggas
No, no, no
Said I ain't got time for these bitches
No, no, no

[Verse 1: Robbie B]
Dark night in a small city
Niggas mob in all black, jamming old 50
Smoke with me, let me show you what my life like
Young god shine bright like a street light
All my niggas known for doing the most
All that shit we flipped the nigga could've bought me a ghost
Other niggas watching While they on their ass tweeting
Off the dome, we was out here on the field eating
Off top, we the reason why your bitches is missing
We the reason all you youngins out here hoping and wishing
Flow terrific just might get some Tuss and put it in mystic
Flow clean like my dick after I wash off your bitch lipstick, hold up

[Hook]
Time ticking and my fingers keep itching
I'm a young nigga chasing the doe
And if you run up disrespecting
Ain't no problem to
Leave your ass on the floor
Ain't got time for these niggas
No, no, no
Said I ain't got time for these bitches
No, no, no

[Verse 2: Yung Simmie]
I ain't got no time, I ain't got no mind
You hating on me nigga you won't get no shine
I'm sipping lean in Texas, I lean the other direction
They searching like an inspection, I'm ducked off protected
Time ticking so I can't kick it
Fingers itching so I'm whipping in the damn kitchen
All my niggas legendary, never scary, Tom and Jerry
Got the rats tryna jack me for my fetty, hope you niggas ready
Chopper chop turn a nigga to spaghetti
Grinding everyday, tryna chase the fetty
Steve Robbs just hit me on my blackberry
Say round the homie up, I ain't talking Yeti

[Hook]
Time ticking and my fingers keep itching
I'm a young nigga chasing the doe
And if you run up disrespecting
Ain't no problem to
Leave your ass on the floor
Ain't got time for these niggas
No, no, no
Said I ain't got time for these bitches
No, no, no

[Verse 3: Mike G]
See me swimming through these lanes
We ain't pictures in the same frame
Have my autograph well displayed on your front page
This level is game is difficult to obtain
And my mind's impossible to contain
Moves like a bullet train, sometimes it's a curse
Since the [?] my purpose just to show my worth
Laying verbs I had women at a loss for words
While we cruise through downtown LA like the Purge is
Murder on sight, family one left to right
Moving on auto-pilot but still I keep 'em excited
I'm bout to start up a riot, tell hating niggas be quiet
I'm too timeless
What these rappers is, I'm two times it

[Hook]
Time ticking and my fingers keep itching
I'm a young nigga chasing the doe
And if you run up disrespecting
Ain't no problem to
Leave your ass on the floor
Ain't got time for these niggas
No, no, no
Said I ain't got time for these bitches
No, no, no
