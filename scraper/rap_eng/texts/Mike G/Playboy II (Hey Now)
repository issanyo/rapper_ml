[Verse 1]
I'm tryna to see how we could raise the price up to this
Makin' missions to the top, Trying to hike up the list
The sky's what I'm kissin' Just listen
I'm sittin' you in detention
You rappers can catch a write up to this
I say new school is simple, it's principal
But classics is all that come from this pencil
That's my enjoyment, and my eyes get wide
That's the same how I see when she looks at my wrist
Said, your legacy can live forever whether
Living lavish or you settlin'
Adidas super colors what I'm steppin' in
Each day is a new test for excellence
And, I keep moving forward like there's nothin' to see
Opportunity keep gunnin' for me
Now I'm convinced there's no reason to sleep
Till I'm lyin' my custom bed sheets, see
No stopping when it's red, but I might drive slow
Yellow stones gon' make her blow like C4
Green in my eyes as far as nights might go
I could turn my ride into the nightclub, yo
See me spittin Chanel and that's my runway flow
Only aim to prevail as far progress goes
Getting the bread as my neck might show
Get rid of the 0's like Randy's though

[Hook]
All I gotta do is set 'em up and knock 'em down
They come from miles around
For daps and pounds like
Hey Now, (Hey Now), Hey Now, (Hey Now)
I say Hey Now, (Hey Now), Hey Now, (Hey Now), a-aye
I know you got it
And You can get it if you wit it
You might say your name and I might forget it
Say Hey Now, (Hey Now), Hey Now, (Hey Now)
I say Hey Now, (Hey Now), Hey Now, (Hey Now), a-aye

[Verse 2]
Find me riding in my coupe, and it's blue
Blowing green, dark tints, two women like the Mystery Machine
Hop out, smoke clouds, I appear over heads
Need a M on my chest like my name is Racer X
We got some ground to cover
Try to be in Monaco like the Blues Brothers
Dreams got me living on a high wire
Got me burnin' my tires like I'm Nightrider
Got me talkin' to myself like there's two of us
Got me feelin' like what I'm getting is never enough
Make me think that there's something that I need to discover
To see new land or to see new colors
What you think, you could just come up like my clique?
You got some work to do before you stack up to this
How does it work when you feel like a veteran?
And still out here talkin' & livin' so young & wreckless
Got a plan to commit no intent to forgive
You know what it is, man it's been years
And Gizzle-Gizzle still keep the flavor in they ear
Tell casino owners that they're lucky i;m here
Pro-Drivers they should get into gear
Tell the kids that there's nothing to fear
Actions go back to your theatre premier
Copilot, please take my place when I jump
I don't take my own pictures, I do my own stunts
I said that I'm back, meet me in the front
I figured it out, is this what you want?

[Hook]
All I gotta do is set 'em up and knock 'em down
They come from miles around
For daps and pounds like
Hey Now, (Hey Now), Hey Now, (Hey Now)
I say Hey Now, (Hey Now), Hey Now, (Hey Now), a-aye
I know you got it
And You can get it if you wit it
You might say your name and I might forget it
Say Hey Now, (Hey Now), Hey Now, (Hey Now)
I say Hey Now, (Hey Now), Hey Now, (Hey Now), a-aye

[Outro]
Sittin' sideways blowin smoke in the air
Porsche swervin' side to side like I couldn't care
She on the passenger side, fingers through my hair
Ask her if she down to ride she gon' say fa sho'
Keep your arms and legs inside don't touch my radio
She love it when we chill, even without a place to go
I gotta run the game, I gotta keep a pace
And tell 'em gon' hate, but say it to my face
