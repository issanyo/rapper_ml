Nothing means as much (Your smile)
Like that special touch (Your smile)
From your smile (Your smile)
Ohh

[Verse 1: Mike G]
I'm so relentless blowing kisses to my mistresses
Just to start arguments to make you want to keep your distance
If situation persist, please seek replacement
And take six, or you'll sink Lower than basements
Say I'm dangerous on any given night
But you should be glorified in ice, gold and lights
A price sold for twice than life might allow
Watch em shout, take a bow
Wave to the crowd, you the greatest now
You without a doubt change the world with a smile
You deserve all of the attention you can take
You're a superstar, you need someone who relates
My only hope is that, my words resonate
When we on the road bae nobody's in the way
Think about what you're gonna be after today
If you have some time then I have something to say, hey...

[Verse 2]
Hey you, high heeled shoes. Those tattoos..
Make me wanna see you under blue moons
I see light as bright as high beams times three
Tell 'em the news if they ask they can't pass me
I know, I know You been through others so don't stress
We both know emotions aren't objects
I'll take you scene by scene, through the makings of a king
One who has plans in which you shouldn't intervene. Yeah
I'm envious, gettin' green
Like a black ninja every time I hit the scene
But you're like... all the colors in the sky
With a smile that shines through sunlight
I can't tell a lie.. for that one I apologize
At least I try. You see that with Helen's eyes
I could care less how others operate
Get aways for dates but there's nothing to escape, hey..

[Outro: Sample]
Baby smile, (Smile)
When you smile, (Smile)
Everything's alright, (Smile)
When you smile, (Smile)
Nothing means as much, (Smile)
Nothing seems to touch, (Smile)
When you smile you light my life up...
