See What I Do Is Breathe Over Tracks
Where The G's Like To Relax With Steez On the Max
And I Be In The Back
Model With Me Bet That
Driver In The Front
Grey, Black
Maybach
Say That
I'm A Good Rapper That's An Understatement
When Its All Said And Done, I'm Damn Amazing
So I Feel Like My Works Unappreciated
Cherish My Songs
Just Because I Made It
Can't Wait Just To Say I Made It
And The People Feel The Words When The Rhymes Are Stated
Tired Of Dealing With Repetitive Cats
Weak Ubiquitous Styles And Repetitive Raps

So What Do I Think Of Success?
Eminem Said It Best
Jay Z Said It Next
Mike G Said The Rest
Said The Best
Words You Ever Heard
Next To The Dictionary
He's Very
Valuable To The Game
Feel Like Me And Kobe Are The Same
I Been Good From The Start
Like A Knife Through The Heart
On The Road Like A Car With No Park
You Goin No Where Like a Bentley With No Start...

See What I Do Is Breathe Over Tracks
Where The G's Like To Relax With Steez On The Max
And I Be In The Black
Lambo
I Can Go
Faster Than The Others
Ballin On Em Like The Ruckers
But The Cali King
Brings Pain Or Rain
Snow, Hail, Sleet Can't Beat Me Im The Weather Man
Man We Ain't The Same...

Broad Daylight I'll Off Ya On Switch
Knock Out Ya Lights Goodnight
Strong Fist
Or Iced Wrist
Fight This
Im So Sick
Write Blue Harvest
Haters Get Wrapped In Plastic
Try The King
You N*ggas Can Get Touched Like iPhone Screens

So What Do I Think Of Success
I Think That Progress Without Process Is Pointless
But Profit Can Come In Anyway
Any Day From Any Place
A Dollar In Any Face
But I Prefer Benjamin
Spend It Then
See How Quick I Can Come Up With Him Again
Him Again?
Yes Sir
Im Back, Friend
To Take Over The Game
Whats My Name?

See What I Do Is Breathe Over Tracks
Where The G's Like To Relax With Steez On The Max
And I Be In The Lac
With The Switches In The Back
Walk Around With A Stack For Fun
Shine Bright Like The Sun
Bass Beatin Like A Gun Comin Down Ya Block
Games Over N*gga Guess Who Won...
