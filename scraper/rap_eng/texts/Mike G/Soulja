[Hook]
I don't what they told you
I am a soulja
I am a soulja
No, no, no
I'm a motherfuckin' soulja, nigga
I'm a motherfuckin' soulja, nigga
I'm a motherfuckin' soulja, nigga
I'm a motherfuckin' soulja, nigga

[Verse]
Whoever reps I give keys to success
While you catch your breath
Watch souljas shadow my steps
And we could battle the rest
It's us against the world
Everyone salute when we hit the parade deck
Militant how I was brought up
If they don't listen they oughtta
Break it down until the sign say "out of order"
We get so deep, we strike water
[?] trying not to get caught up
With the rumours and gossip
I go so hard but the flow is melodic
[?]
[?] if you don't listen when I'm talking
Keep your distance from enemies [?]
Play the game for the game
Now we [?] for the pain
[?] so much [?]
And that's all through out being 12 years a slave
To something that will take you to your grave, what a shame

[Hook]
I don't know what they told you
I am a soulja
I am a soulja
No, no, no
I'm a motherfuckin' soulja, nigga
I'm a motherfuckin' soulja, nigga
I'm a motherfuckin' soulja, nigga
I'm a motherfuckin' soulja, nigga
