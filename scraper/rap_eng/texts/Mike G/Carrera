[Hook: Vince Staples]
I spit with the passion of the Christ who abandoned me
Life's a game of love and war, everyone's a casualty
I casually, kill them all, tell me why you mad at me
You lucky that I let you breathe
But on the trill, I'm just triple beam, scheming
Double murder dreaming
Aim a eagle at any nigga giving me a reason
I'm a demon, rollin' with a legion
Heart colder than the bitches decomposing in the freezer

[Verse 1: Mike G]
Cooking up crack as if music is my kitchen
I became Godzilla with the poorest disposition
I went through this shit believing that everything was written
I was wrong because that would make this entire world fiction
That's falsified your info is inaccurate
Iâ€™d die for this like Martyrs but a little more passionate
Cause if it came down to it I kill for it
Coal still fine, want them triple six degrees of separation
The bodies didn't disappear, we threw them in the lakes and
Moved them to the next name on my list of niggas waitin'
Which would leave the widows with heart aches and
Then we move to the list of bitches bein' patient
Uhh, I kill em by the 8th and, get paid in pounds
So now I'm sellin' weight and, now there's fans waitin'
Just for a chance to see him
Worldwide they sayin' that they need him
Fuck a hometown hero I'm a legion in my region

[Hook: Vince Staples]

[Verse 2: Mike G]
I was so sick, knew that she couldn't resist it
With words so slick, I pass a Limitless Resistance
I'm suggesting you should pay for this
When I'd rather write no need for honorable mention
Ask who I work with they ask "Who do you like?"
Well I don't look up to no other niggas but MellowHype
And like, Vince and Ace and shit
And Earl and Frank and then there's Matt Martians, Syd of course Earl again, and Domo Gen
Don't know who else to trust, you know my luck switch
So who do I fuck with? Niggas I came up with
Raised with respect I must've lost it along the way
I hope my mom don't see the shit I say to chicks like every fucking day
Tell a bitch, "Pick up a book, and read between the lines"
I watch 'em close, but these bitches ain't as precious as my time
I want money for generations, only then will I be fine
After I cop a white Porsche, and name it Cloud 9
