Hey you
Playing cymbals on your shoes
I would like to tell the news

We don't know
That's the blues
Wanna live
Pick and choose
Ginger ale, Absolut
Off the ledge
Parachute

[Hook]
Sit you down and give you some time
Talk a little, look you in the back of your eyes
Calm you down and make another right
Take a little time and you're fallin' all night

Hey world
I've got to let you know
Take all
I've rhymed about before
Let go
The doubters let them fall
Yellow
You're scared, it ain't my fault
Drive slow

[Hook]
When you just get love
And never get love
You'd better let love depart
I know it's so
And yet I know
I can't get you out of my heart

[Mike G]
Yeah
This evening's as phenomenal as the event of us meeting
The most decent thing you sayin', that you had me at a greeting
Our first sight is noted as a maiden flight
Not even worried, what's done in the dark will come to the light
Cause we move so fast, I hope we make it through tonight
See, these things cross my mind from time to time
Your presence is as melodic as making these words rhyme
I'm falling behind, hoping you will fall in line

[Hook]
