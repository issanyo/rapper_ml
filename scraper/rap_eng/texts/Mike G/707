[Verse 1]
Nah King Mike G, know we stay OF till the death
Best bitches get wet off of that pineapple express
Thought I told you that that rain don't stop
They ain't taking me in unless they bring like 54 cops
Nigga fuck rules, fuck you, fuck a jail sentence
All them fucking critics say my gang is a gimmick
Make em say, "God". Pray to Odd, theres no other
If I was 21 I woulda had the Fader front cover
Know we keep it criminal, run up in your housing
Young gunna been snapin necks since two thousand
Never one for stress my nigga I just blaze
Them LA streets is death like I was trapped inside a cage
Now it's sold out shows, jumping off the stage
But never lose sight, still lookin' for better days
This is fire coming out them beats by dre
But I dont even fuck with Kush my nigga I like haze
