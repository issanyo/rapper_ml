[Chorus]
We used to make love together
Now we break up together
(Farewell, forever)
We break up together

Such a strange kind of pleasure
Now we break up together
(Oh well, whatever)
We break up together

[Verse 1]
We used to share everything
Toothpaste, laughter, and the kitchen sink
And nothin could come between
Two young lovers sharing everything

But somehow things have changed
There's no more laughter, no more kitchen sink
And though we can't remain
At least I know that we can share the pain

[Verse 2]
We used to read fairytales
Flip the pages to the very end
And sing aloud happily
Ever after, we would play pretend

But somehow things have changed
The story's over, at the very end
And though we can't remain
At least I know that we can share the pain

[Bridge]
We'll share the grief
And we'll share the blame
Divvy the guilt
And we'll split the shame
We'll drift apart, but somehow we'll stay
Connected through our suffering
