[Verse 1: Mike G]
We kill em all faster than you could blink
I chain these words together man I flow gold links
I'm the realest you see as no tricks are up my sleeve
So I can sit back and watch my kingdom grow like seeds
I won't leave till I own most seas
And blow down trees till I just can't breathe
Show lights excite till crowds can't see
I'm froze on lean cuz my flows codiene
My aim is supreme cream elites occupy my team
Billions and bitches I blind brightly when I gleam
16s for the fiends getting green from each my schemes
No reason to hate me I match whatever you bring
My circle runs rings im a king of an assortment of things
I grow wings I might fly north for the spring
I’m such a lyrical demon im hellbound for breathing
You can reign forever believe him as long as you don't
Give someone a reason for treason you stay from decease
Then when I die you can bury me in egypt
Next to whoever the last person was that ruled most recent
Can’t take em but bury me with my material things
My lust grew into a need cuz I deserve it I want it
I think my tombstone should read KV100
Mirror images of me so they're all backwards
How much gold do I need to reach pharaoh status
I got bars they got lines so they're all actors
And nothing but delays to me, they're all practice
I got things up in the stash that could make you backflip
Plottin the best ways to take the cash like government does taxes
I’m after bitches with ass and Versace glasses
Anything else I’m Steve Nashing
I took this rap serious found it as a passion
Now I'm in Hawaii getting lei’d with Jasmines, I’m dead wrong

[Verse 2: Mike G]
There’s not many strong enough to hold the world in their palms
I promised I’d never look back or I’d turn and dissolve
You see my light shine long and far like those of stars I could spit two bars and cause the world to pause
I rap everything that's murderous every time I'm verbal
It's crazy how they diminish I'm ill start to finish
I'll rip apart your tenants, with a sentence
You better hope the author brings a happy ending, cause it's been written
And documentation was the first time I picked up a pen
Wolves will come and get ya, see more crosses than Christians
And I ain't into religion but hell is where we've been it gets hot
I'm like the furnace you notice the heat is on
So focus on your singles hope listeners sing along
Those are praises no one will hear after you're gone and
That's the worst way to put your whole life in a song I'm dead wrong
