(Hook)
The more you try… to erase me…
The more… the more…
The more that I appear…
Oh the more, the more…
The more you try… to erase me…
The more… the more…
The more that I appear…
Oh the more, the more…

(Verse 1: Mike g)
I'm feeling better than I’ve ever been
I can’t wait any more, my patience wearing thin
Now I gotta get it I, gotta get it like an addict
So until I’m on top feel like I gotta have it
Nothing’s promised, so that's the way it may be
But I’m grinding till I’m RIP, Ghost like Swayze
RIP, this is pretty much the Point Break
And I only do this cuz I lay up wide awake
Thinking ‘bout how I’m gonna make a million man
And, I can’t talk to the homies cuz they don’t understand
How I’m trying to get rich off rap, it’s what I think about
Ain’t got a 9 to 5 so my lyrics gotta work it out
I’m thuggin’, ain’t no walkin’ out, this is what I’m talking bout
Now I’m putting them in a dry spell without a drought
Persistence is the reason that they couldn't’t fade me
I’m living ever baby, no way to erase me

(Hook)
The more you try… to erase me…
The more… the more…
The more that I appear…
Oh the more, the more…
The more you try… to erase me…
The more… the more…
The more that I appear…
Oh the more, the more…

(Verse 2)
Call me a lyrical mastermind, haters try to stop my shine
But they all fail like final top, hate me cuz they see that I’m above ‘em
I don’t pay attention to ‘em, I just say fuck ‘em like
I ain’t mad, I’m just trying to see through all the madness
To get on my level now they gotta get a song with Lavish
Living lavish, savage, now they try to test me but I pass it
Where they at in Paston, laughing like hyenas, sit in traffic
But I wanna go, on a roll, where they at I been before
I been there a while ago, happy but I’m smiling though
Grinding out I’m shining mo’, shining out I’m blinding mo’
And I don’t like the clothes without the atom bomb logo
Chaa… or the 8th life label, I’ve got hosts of polos, looking like a street weirmo
Yesssss I said they like a street weirmo
This rogue status feel a man bet they come to the gun show

(Hook)
The more you try… to erase me…
The more… the more…
The more that I appear…
Oh the more, the more…
The more you try… to erase me…
The more… the more…
The more that I appear…
Oh the more, the more…

The more I try… to erase you…
The more… the more…
The more that you appear…
No, you’re wrong, you’re wrong
You’re wrong, you’re wrong
You’re wrong, you’re wrong
You’re wrong, you’re wrong

(Outro {starts at “the more I try… to erase you…”})
They ain’t gon erase me, I ain’t going nowhere
Ain’t gon erase me, RIP till I’m Ghost like Schwayze
RIP, uh… gotta get a song with Lavish
Living lavish, savage, now they try to test me but I pass it
Where they at Paston, laughing like hyenas
Yeah I’m mike check, one two one two
I’m here, I’m Mike G nigga who are you?
Ain’t nothing to fear… okay
What I do… I can’t be touched
I’m just trying to get recognized
I ain’t smoking but I’m extra high
I’m here now, I live forever
Forever-ever, forever-ever
