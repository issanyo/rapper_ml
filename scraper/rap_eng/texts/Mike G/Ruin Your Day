[Intro: Sahtyre]
Alright, cool. Oh there we go. Boom
Yeah now I hear it
Yeah! Hann! Yeah!

[Hook: Sahtyre]
Niggas better know it, spark it when I roll it
Pass it when I light it, all my niggas on it
You can not control it, you can just behold it
World in my palm, that's a nuke bomb
World in my palm, that's a nuke bomb
World in my palm, that's a nuke bomb, yeah
World in my palm, that's a nuke bomb
World in my palm, that's a nuke bomb

[Verse 1: Sahtyre]
Think outside the box, I'm claustrophobic
Fuck what y'all say and y'all can quote it, yeah
Make every move stretch that's aerobics
And the money is the symptom not the motive
I been on a crazy train of thought loco-motive
When national from local cause it's loco when I wrote it, yeah
I been in beast mode, now you feel demoted, ah
I been in increase mode, think I got promoted, ah
Lit when we pour it, spit like a poet
Had my bitch singing duets off of this Moet, damn
So high she fucked around and floated, yeah
She was chained to the bed when she wrote it

[Hook: Sahtyre]
Niggas better know it, spark it when I roll it
Pass it when I light it, all my niggas on it
You can not control it, you can just behold it
World in my palm, that's a nuke bomb
World in my palm, that's a nuke bomb
World in my palm, that's a nuke bomb, yeah
World in my palm, that's a nuke bomb
World in my palm, that's a nuke bomb

[Verse 2: Mike G]
Come to me for whatever you're seeking. See
They want a trilla G. That's not music for the weak, and
He can go a hundred miles, desert or snow
My qualities arose, where ever it grows. I know
I know my souls the Lord's to hold
I made a band cross the street like Abbey Road
Imma run for office, give me your vote
My bitch blow presidents like Marlyn Monroe
We got have to work it out like calisthenics
I'm convinced their intent is to shift my momentum
In any event, I had to wrap it up quick
Back then, I was a shy nigga like Twista
Go suspenseful just to blow mental's
Then watch how quick they get so forgetful

Niggas better know it, spark it when I roll it
Pass it when I light it, all my niggas on it
You can not control it, you can just behold it
World in my palm, that's a nuke bomb
World in my palm, that's a nuke bomb
World in my palm, that's a nuke bomb, yeah
World in my palm, that's a nuke bomb
World in my palm, that's a nuke bomb
