*devilish laughing*

[Hook]
Stop, all of that bullshit that you talking about
Quit, all of that nonsense coming out of your mouth
FLA, I'm a Stunna coming straight out the south
They been sleeping on me, so the beast inside me Imma let that boy out
Stop, all of that bullshit that you talking about
Quit, all of that nonsense coming out of your mouth
FLA, I'm a Stunna coming straight out the south
They been sleeping on me, so the beast inside me Imma let that boy out

[Verse 1: Pouya]
Yuh!
I'm a Stunna, you a liar
Man I keep that shit three hunna like I'm Durk
Don't get murked, I need my money on the first
Don't play with me, this ain't Nintendo
It's going down like limbo
Mikey hanging out the window, steal the limo, man just popped a pill
Bitch you in, for the thrill
She loves my life cause it's surreal
Pussy bald, Howie Mandel
Got that bitch sweating, my dick straight from hell
Beat that shit, leave that shit, bring that shit, smell
We hitting the liquor, not going to jail
Cause all of my homies around me gon' bail
Did some foul shit that you never would tell
Baby bone, that's your show. Make that bitch feel at home
Juggin up out my phone, talking that money
The ho, you can leave me low
Cold like a Frosty cone, left in the freezer for two hundred years
Do it for me, and all of my peers
To all of the struggle and all of the tears
All of the blood and the feeling of fear
We finna make it just give me a year

[Hook]
Stop, all of that bullshit that you talking about
Quit, all of that nonsense coming out of your mouth
FLA, I'm a Stunna coming straight out the south
They been sleeping on me, so the beast inside me Imma let that boy out
Stop, all of that bullshit that you talking about
Quit, all of that nonsense coming out of your mouth
FLA, I'm a Stunna coming straight out the south
They been sleeping on me, so the beast inside me Imma let that boy out

[Verse 2: Mike G]
Finish Him
I'm a rider, take me higher
I been told you I spit fire
You keep hiding, Imma find ya
Need my money on arrival
Crowds keep bouncing, I move mountains
I got flow like waterfountains
Holding gems, I got vaults of them
Imma show you what my crews about
See since summer '09, I never stopped grinding
Succes is the only outcome I got time for
You holding me up? Then you get knocked down
And that's a fact like fiction was not in my options
I need the water, my total control
Anything other can be put on hold
Shout out to my brother Pouya, you cold
I make thousands, tryna make gold
And now they standing in line, just to hear all these rhymes
You gotta get yours, I gotta get mine
But I can snatch both if you give me the time
These shades I got on, you can't stop my shine
Talking Grammys and such, you going to pay me or what?
If anyone want, we can meet in the front
But I'm up for peace, I'm beyond your reach
A heaven to hold and too much to touch
Know where you going, the future is written
Focus on your mission, you fly with your visions
Apply what you're listing, cause doing is way more effective than wishing
We killed it with this one
