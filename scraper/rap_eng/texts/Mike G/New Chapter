[Verse 1: Mike G]
Here's a story that you know so well
One that only few go through but many like to tell
Indeed, you look up to heroes whenever they prevail
But [?] run and tell
I take the good with the bad, happy with the sad times
Looking through the glass, like a clear view of road signs
You could do the math and tell that I'm gifted
So strict with this is ridiculous
Just for instance, watch how I keep 'em in line
And watch 'em like the military
King's finest and I'm highest, most highest
[?] and the co-pilot

[Chorus: Rakeem Miles]
I'ma just be me right now
I don't really know me right now
But I'ma get to know me right now
I'ma just be me right now

[Verse 2: Rakeem Miles]
I've been going through it will you pray for me
And some shit go down, will you wait for me
Ain't no one there and it's sad to see
So it's fuck y'all and that's how I feel
If they came for you then they keep it real
I don't feel you niggas, that's why I can't appeal
I'm a stainless soul, I'ma be me
That's how it's supposed to be, that's how it's supposed to be
You don't love you so you expose yourself
So you changed up just to gain the wealth
And I stay afloat and remain myself
And it's just me, I don't need no help

[Chorus: Rakeem Miles]
I'ma just be me right now
I don't really know me right now
But I'ma get to know me right now
I'ma just be me right now

[Bridge]
Right now
Right now

[Verse 3: YoAstrum]
You see, I'm smoking on a cardi
While I'm in the garden state
State of mind [?]
Yo, my steez so filthy
{?] like DiCaprio (whoa)
I'm signing titties
Catch me if you can
God damn it
Got the wind up on my shoulders
As I'm stomaching the damage
My legs maintain, and my mind will understand it
[?] but I'll be stingy with the sample
Rich and now with the flow
Nigga got [?]
Ample with the ammo
Gra-ta-ta
Runnin' to the sun and I'm leaving footprints of pyro
My soul lava
[?]
I'm so proper
I'm an Aries too
Love a challenge
I'm a champion
It's a honor
I like [?] self-endulge
[?]
Oh, baby, baby, baby please behave ya
[?] hell ya
[?] and I ain't paying a na-na
Kickin' bad habits but I'm stuck in the low
[?] always looking for [?]
Still ask myself why I do what I do
Goddamn it nigga, what do I do?


[Outro]
Back where I started
Back where I started
Back where I used to be
Back where I started
Back where I started
Back where I used to be, yeah
