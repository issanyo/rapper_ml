[Intro]
Alright quiet on the set, yeah. Yeah, uh, yeah

[Verse]
Inhale, exhale
Keep the block hoppin hectic, keep the streets hot as hell
I'm the doorway, felatious females filling up the foyer
Falling for the foreplay before we hit the atrium
I don't want to dates with 'em
I can't keep my pace
I Bust quicker than red balloons flying into space with 'em
So bad with relations, you may have to excuse me
Living like the final scene of James Bond movies
I go hot pursuit and do it by my lonely
Specific to your vision for your eyes only
Spectre, plus a spectacle
All cause my profession better than whatever war was won with whichever weapon
Spitting rhymes when I'm flying causing explosive decompression
I been coughing up the competition with asthmatic breath
And boasting over my brother's beats, facts I must confess
May we live this life the best we can, do it cause I know you could
Ride along your own road, grip it like the wheel's would
Watchin niggas cower, got me feelin' like the old Suge
I'ma need two spots, so when I turn the engine I could make the coupe hop
Screamin' 'Thug Life', 2Pac
You knew what was coming like I told you read a spell
For something we bout to summon
I'm coming straight from hell on a broad day
You niggas is actors and you all deserve Broadway
All day, kings what the cards say
Ain't no need to back track
King plus the Ace will forever make blackjack
Me and Left Brain make scriptures, they should add that
I know all I gotta do is everything I can to outlast opinions of
Every single man that doubts this new religion
In time you learn what you could live without
And how much you earn with the things that are given
You see fast cash comes like missions with black masks
My impact gon' last like the After math
From nuclear blasts
Treat these rhymes like escape ladders to traps
So far from average
They try to take the style as often as you get taxed and that's tragic
From the ground I built a palace
Treat life like I'm not playing a game
Still gold version, stadium status, yeah
