[Hook: Mediumjay]
Most of you foos, should have stayed in school (3x)
Learning education is a mighty tool

[Verse 1: Mediumjay]
Integration with education, offering up advanced communication
Only the best, invested information, I'm sitting in class learning with patience
While you'd rather be working the day shift, I come home relax while your stuck on the station
Wasting your time for minimum wage and I goto school learn a trade and double what your making
Face it intelligence is what saving, Building up a business and also some relations
Building up a condo for a nice vacation, while your stuck working for your vaccination
I come out clean fresh with no agent, Your cleaning up my mess, the department of sanitation
Scratch the itch on my own back, no hesitation. Claws and a cape, CatPack global domination
I would explain it to you but it's the wrong dictation, Somebody better free mason

[Verse 2: MIKEG]
Payless swaggin on em, Behind the counter looking like I'm snorting with the powder
But I'm not, I'm drinking up the liquid crack rock
The first sip takes a bit, the second sip makes me itch
The third, Well I can run a lap around the world
The fourth like the whole with the germ
Sure I feel bad but I want a little more
?? Scottie Pippen, Red Bull over tummy or my stomachs empty
Stashing cans of the bull in shoes, cause my pockets full
Swimming in pools of the luscious liquid
If this bitch spit it, I lick it up with the quickness
I'm never wasting, a single drip in, RB in my IV Grip
Large can in her mouth to shut the little fucking whiny bitch

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Mediumjay]
Some of you lames ain't got time to read a book
Bet you got a television, bet you got a facebook
Pick up a book and empower yourself
Put this song on for an hour of help
Repeat if you need, it also improves your health
Improves your brain and gives you a blackbelt
Theres no new skills required you just get a bell
Hell in a cell but that's the wrong topic
If you got some weed then we can get it poppin'
But only for a fee, cause I ain't droppin'
No offerings shit not even for the coppers
I would right a book but you probably wouldn't cop it
Cause your out shopping
