[Verse 1]
Maybe I’ll stick out on the pavement
Under your sneakers I’ve been waiting
To catch a whiff of something
Wishing, hoping, praying
Maybe I’ll slip into the back of a limousine
I must have skipped out of the heavens
Cranking my ego to 11
Me and my solo mission
Hittin' and hittin' and missin'
Maybe I'll make it to the back of a magazine

[Chorus]
Somebody pick me up off the ground
Take me to the lost and found
Somebody accidentally put me down
Take me to the lost and found

[Verse 2]
I know it’s drastic but I’m jaded
Mr. Fantastic, yeah I made it
Too many hands are shakin'
Thank you, I love it, I hate it
Too many kisses in the back of a limousine
First it was vintage, now it's dated
High definition, now it's faded
This intuition doesn’t
Feel like it’s makin’ a statement
Without some lipstick and a head full of gasoline

[Chorus]
Somebody pick me up off the ground
Take me to the lost and found
Somebody accidentally put me down
Take me to the lost and found

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 3]
I must have blacked out in the basement
Scratching my television, aching
One sip of Kool-Aid got me drunk on the expectation
And now I'm naked in the back of a magazine

[Chorus]
Somebody pick me up off the ground
Take me to the lost and found
Somebody accidentally put me down
Take me to the lost and found

[Chorus Variation]
I wanna mingle in the lost and found
Everyone's single in the lost and found
Somebody accidentally put me down
Take me to the lost and found
