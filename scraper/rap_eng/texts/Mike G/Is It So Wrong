[Verse 1]
In the moment that we met
I didn't know you were taken
But when we shared a cigarette
I wanted to make something happen
Ooh, ooh, I made my way towards ya
Tried to talk to you, 'bout your life and your scene
Ooh, ooh, but I got a question for ya
When did asking ever set a person free?

[Chorus]
Is it so wrong that I let you know?
Is it so wrong that I let it show?
I want you so bad, I can't let it go
Is it so wrong that I let you know?

[Verse 2]
Am I coming off too strong?
Well I wasn't raised to be weak
I think that we could get along
So why not try to make something happen?
Ooh, ooh, I bent my arms around ya
Just to see if our shoulders were in sync
Ooh, ooh, I bought a beer for ya
You don't have to be single to drink

[Chorus]
Is it so wrong that I let you know?
Is it so wrong that I let it show?
I want you so bad, I can't let it go
Is it so wrong that I let you know?

[Bridge]
Is it so wrong, is it so wrong?
Singing this song, singing this song
Is it so wrong, is it so wrong?
Singing this song, singing this song

[Chorus]
Is it so wrong that I let you know?
Is it so wrong that I let it show?
I want you so bad, I can't let it go
Is it so wrong, is it so wrong that I let you know?
