[Intro]
Yeah
YMCM..B
Uh, alright

[Verse 1]
Uh, I said my patience wears thin
With lacks of violence
Put the world on my shoulders I play it like violins
And since, I really make none in present tense
I, really write my lyrics in hieroglyphics
I' really fight my lyrics cannot be condensed
And the best, will never feel the need to convince
My army's offense exceeds any resistance
Be nice bitch I just might let you meet Vince
The lightswitch, so breaks are something I don't need
My reign roams I'm constantine with gold teeth
I play ? realer than the words that i speak
In same songs and I own every, day of the week
I go hard, there's no telling where time goes
But my slow-mo flows put the world on hold
I roll like snowball effects, just watch me grow
I'm Jack Frost I'm so cold my shadow glows, oh

[Outro]
