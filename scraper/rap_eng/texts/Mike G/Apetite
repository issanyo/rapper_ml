"Bitches come and go
Come And Go, Till They Find Out... (x4)"

Look, bitches come and go, like everywhere you go
Look, I ain't on no fuckery
No 'sus'ary don't fuck with me
Hoes don't get no love from me
Flyest fucking bugs we be
Swanging in my truck with ease
Hopping out with fresh white t's
She looking like she just a tease
Get that ho up on her knees
Bag her then teabag her then slide out, that's how it's supposed to be
She wishing well, I throw some change
Penny for your thoughts, bitch
I just want them drawers bitch
Tryna cut like saws, bitch
I ain't tryna play Gepetto, I don't want no strings attached
I just want to get the scoop ?
But wait, wait, fuck you reaching
All up in my pockets for?
Don't fuck with that unless you reaching
All under my boxer ho
That ho sucks, tryna slidea cool one on me, fuck that!
Act just like my pockets diseased and bitch you don't touch that
She lurkin on a mission I'm using my intuition bitches
Come and go like seasons
Grab your poles and get to fishing nigga

[Hook]

If you don't get new green, then you show no gain
If they ain't asking you for answers, Then you hold no reigns
People call me different like I got a new name
Now I'm Mike, Every time you see me got a few chains
G, For my first gold one, Versace medallions
You see me as number one, champion
This can be done, improper:
You gotta to do it right, to prove yourself to others
You probably have to do it twice
That's why I'm so self-centered, I'm not focused on you
Others are never too busy to tell you all they have to do
At this point I could never care, you say you see me everywhere
I had prior engagements be glad you joined in this affair
So you see, bitches come and go
All the time, til they find out
That I got a stash waiting patient in my hide out
Wonder, 'what makes you love me now?'
I can make your style switch
Hold on to your pride when you look me in my eyes, bitch
