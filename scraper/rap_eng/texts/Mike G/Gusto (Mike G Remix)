[Verse 1: Zion I]
Looking out over the skyline
Twisted up in my mind
Holy visions fighting wars within the serpentine
Buy time but I'm lying if I said I'm fine
Catch myself crying
Hard to figure why
Between loneliness, ecstasy and bliss
Clenching up my fist
Dark Knights walk like this is Gotham
Babylon is sending them crooks to derive them
Those who vocal who cause problems
Lost in another world of fairy tales and goblins
Castle rooks move pawns for the jooks
And cooks like prawn for the books
My foot broke down hooked on the outbound
Dazed and pacing through the hood now
Yeah these goons move masons
I'm on a quest to sell what I'm chasing
Fazed like through a lava light
Psychedelic I'm propelled zen
Poppa on the mic
Peace out to Oscar, Peace out to Trey
(Incomprehensible) Imma see you one day
Head down concentrating trying to find
True solutions that could remedy the mind
In due time, we all face the music
But this is your life, you were put here to use it

[Hook]
If I fall, lift me up though
If I fall once again then I'm stuck oh
It's kinda hard to get up
It's for us going hard for the gusto

[Verse 2: Mike G]
Pay attention to the things I teach
I reach high speeds sitting in front seats
I keep souvenirs from each place I breach
I do amazing things just to get no sleep
I guarantee it will be extremely difficult to find
Realer than me and my team baby
Life is more than clothes and diamond rings
Together we kill em all and flee the scene
So blaze one
My conscience state compares to none
Hold on to your applause cause we just begun
Stack papers we're rap slayers from homos to haters
The fact is on this I'm destined for greatness
I'm so far ahead I know who's coming after
Same name as my father and his favorite rapper Harley Van
But when I go home it's all love
And believe I hold the microphone like a grudge
But with ease what do you need I do what I please
I bring destees to bring women to their knees
She bring lean and paper with trees in between
What a dream, shooting belteens in Golf Wang jeans
