[Verse 1: Mike G]
Sitting in smoke, borderline criminal
Throwing rockstar signs out the back window
At those who are sadly so unoriginal
But never give up on your goals, no one should ever hinder those

Pulled me out the car [?]
Close to catching them charges
Like they [?]
White Audi on a '93 Bronco

Bullets flying like footballs, niggas dying pronto
Over money trees rolling fronto [?] fossils
Rap [?] my environment hustles that powder

Light a [?]
She's a ghetto [?], I'm high as a helicopter
Through hell and high water, daughter of [?]

I let her tweet, roll my [?] while my homies watch
Dip down [?] while I'm bumping [?]
I use my knowledge, not a [?]
