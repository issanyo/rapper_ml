Say none, play none, be cool
Still got my Sega that I had since pre school
But I dont play games no more, see where im coming from
They said lets make one, I tell em get it done
Tell em blaze one, I tell em get it done
Because a session is no fun without funds
We to the mattresses like grab ya guns
I tell em kill em all, leave none
Be nimble, aim quick
And if you miss one, make a return trip
Doctor's orders, he tell me burn this
Had to detox, but I'm still sick
I'm what they rap about next
This is an Eclipse and everything black but the checks
I don't fuck with niggas cuz they all lack respect
So I don't even show my face I am Racer X
Now I got em saying Oh man
They ask me hows life, bout a hundred grand
And I love women, but fuck bitches
Because I love money, I fuck riches
They saying Mike youre really great I can't debate
And I use to give a fuck, you caught me a little late
Now I got em saying Oh Man
Taking shots to the head like a keg stand
First Sunday, church service I'm that nice
And I'm so high, swear I've died twice
My God, we can't solve em
Future's Odd, thats a problem
Got no math they ain't pass me
Fuck green, burn trees
And they've been on me since I dropped coke keys
Check it out I cook the music and serve it up to the fiends
Naw mean, now I got em sayin Oh Man
Niggas that lay down are the one's I can't stand
And my mafia deep nigga, triple 6's
I don't tell no one shit they all snitches
They saying Mike youre really great I can't debate
And I use to give a fuck, you caught me a little late
Now I got em sayin Oh man
To take over the world was always in my plans
Never changed, never can
I'm that fly, I think I'm Superman
Said I'd never change, I'm always real
This is some Superman, this is Smallville
That means this is my town, I run this shit
And all my bitches age no lower than 26
Feelin pretty good, can't tame me
Had to switch courses, I'm in lane c
You see G, OF
I'm a Black Star, Mos Def
You know how it go, show em no respect
I drown kids I don't want nigga hold ya breath
Now I got em sayin' God damn
No two ways around it nigga I'm the man
Already know, you a fan
We goin' up in smoke, call it Amsterdam

Now I got em sayin' Oh man
Step lightly around me like hot sand
My mafia deep nigga, triple 6's
I don't tell no one shit they all snitches
They saying Mike youre really great I can't debate
And I use to give a fuck, you caught me a little late
Now I got em sayin Oh man
