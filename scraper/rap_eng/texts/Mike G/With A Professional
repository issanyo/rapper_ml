[Intro: Mike G]
You gon' do this like this...

[Verse 1: Mike G]
You now fuckin' with the greatest
Mars complex and y'all still basic
I know y'all niggas gon' see no lasik
And I'mma be here for a while, face it
Uh, and since I'mma be here for a while I pace it
I ain't even gotta run the whole race kid
That's what I learned when I took that first turn and realized
None of these niggas could face him
I mean, none of these niggas could fade him
I shine bright and daylight's way dim
But sometimes its hard to be a man
I'm on my feet below ground
Homie understand, cause
Sometimes I can't tell what's real
Checking my head above water like a navy seal
Just trying to let y'all know how I feel, ya dig?
Cuz I'm pretty much in rare form
She said I shine bright
I had my shades on
If I could fly at night, then I'd be way gone
You wouldn't see me for weeks
I'd never be at home, at home
Yeah, you now fucking with the best
I reserved my spot above the rest
Numero uno there's no contest
But if you can do what I do, then you got my respect...
Yeah, you got my respect
Uh, You got my respect...

[Mike G: Verse 2]
You fucking with a professional
It's obvious
And I'mma need a model chick that's gorgeous
And I just want you to tune in
T.I., see I, realize, I'm a stand up guy
Never stand 4, 5, 6 coupes engines revvin'
Count 'em 7,8,9, sky high touching heaven pray to god I succeed
If I do, It won't just be me
My whole team coming too
Said its all good
Waiting for the day I make some cash like I knew I would
Like 200 on the dash like I knew I would
Doing shows paid cash
Like I knew I would
Just to say, I told you so
Rub it in the face of people who told me no
But I can't stop looking forward
It's a curse I know
I'm on till I go
Just check my flow I'm just trying to do this, do this
Just wish you could see my visions
Just wish you could see how I'm living
Not just do this for fun, not really
Cause I'm trying to make a milli, like this
Mike G, possibly the best you ever heard of
I reserved my spot above the rest
And I know I can't be seen

[Outro: Mike G]
Fucking with a professional, with a professional
You now fucking with the best
You know fucking with the best
You fucking with a professional
