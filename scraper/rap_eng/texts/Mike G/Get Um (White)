[Verse 1]
Never say I'm a G, but I show it
So great, I don't say I rap I'm a poet
Light weight champion on the stand, ringin bells
Fighting with no opposition for grill, chains and belts
I said I look like Midus with gold on
Came up, waited so long to win, I feel like LeBron
I try to tell them, but they must not wanna know
How easily I transform awesome to audio
This flow can fill pools like everyone in the world put together
Never passed that class, but life changed for the better
How can I go to school? I'm already too clever
I like to say I rule, I think it's good measure
No matter how they break you down, never let 'em tear you apart
Don't need fake friends, should've been real from the start
How can I respect you when you do not respect my art
In this Odd army, I'm a solider worthy of purple hearts

[Hook]
Everyone wants your space and I get 'em
I'm the one they want to replace and I get 'em
But you'll hardly find me in the same place with 'em
Useless without a vision, can't do nothing with him
But listen, everyone wants your space and I get 'em
I'm the one they wanna replace and I get 'em
But, You'll hardly find me in the same place with 'em
Useless without a vision you can do nothing with 'em
But listen

[Verse 2]
I'm so high, I need altimiters in my ride
My conquest for nonsense, never subsides
Like race cars, So far ahead of ya now
Zooming at 100 miles, you know my style
And whether it helps or not, I plot to get a lot
If things don't change for the better, something that's a stop
But whatever it takes to move the pieces into place
I'm constantly out of town, outward-bound on interstates
Won't deal with constant complaints
Cause we reveal our truer face
Others replace as often as they would say a grace
We don't in the same ways, as I say I would grace a stage
Grace you with my presance or pictures to post on your page
And no one ever told me that this may be so contagious
Together we make this place as fascinating as spaces is
Which is something that these others can't do and that's tough
It's gonna be a good while before they catch up...
They wanna know what's best and that's us, yo

[Hook]
