[Verse 1: Pyramid Vritra]
Hair strands in the breeze in the Porsche
Wood dash Forest Green in the cabin
Hash bricks through the sleeve in the casket
Dinner course, travel bored, flow endorsed
Why the rag top down In France
After the show, probably stoned
Cold as Jack Frosty wrist, and neckless
Bar city, silly niggas try to check the click, untouched
Cus we don't fuck with too much of y'all shit and
None of yours can compare to our shit
Thats double clause you should double take, watch us Demonstrate how a legends made
All my niggas paid, and you see it
Young niggas joc tryna claim allegiance, niggas get popped tryna Play a defense
Run figures, from the brand to the gang, from the tape to the chain
Nigga rain longer cloudy sky, reign stronger til we die
Sold into the game player change, invade and multiply
Sly coop in that sly coupe as we glide through off that dark glue
Never carpool, only 2 seats and its the same for the rest of the gang. Wang

[Bridge: Mike G]
It takes longer to gain more anything that's just not given
My current mission is to be stronger than any opinion
You keep dissin', you get missing
Look at these carats you lose vision
Treat winning like tradition, either get wit' it or get outwitted
See a flame would burn the same with any other name
This is high octane that bangs beyond block range
Stay frozen as if Winter season did not change
Nothing but cold blood flow in my hot veins

[Verse 3: Mike G]
Yo, Moments like these are when I lace my shoes
And roll up on the best GQ issues
Full moon, I got two shows soon
But I'm focused how to smoke in my hotel room
And now everybody's focused on what you do next
Any mistake could give you bad reputation like Joan Jett
Can't stop, won't stop, so I get no rest
Jackals at my doorstep but they're there to protect
Makes sense, I became a myth
With words whipped I could build pyramids
We have no common ground without ways to relate
And it's weird how hate can rebuild your faith
Treated like perfect games when we step in the lane
So without planning this there's no room for change
They hate us, still debate us over Odd Future playlist
Rolling as deep as the Raiders
With paitence is how I play this, yeah
