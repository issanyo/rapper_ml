Now who you know sicker than G?
Take beats and LD's, My inhale on THC
I'm here, They ain't gonna lose me like school ID's
Cameras on the new movie is King Ali
They say I don't speak slow enough
Always put me down I just keep showing up
Tried to explain they just keep saying what
Say we can't get on the stations cause we keep saying fuck
Well, there's rules to be broken so I crush that
We stick around y'all flash like a bus pass
I was invented committed never ever break, fast
The stick up was just to jack them for they lunch cash
That's pretty bold, so the competition's faint
Won't tell you to get on my level because you can't
Sue me
You'll be hitting the floor like fuck roofies
I rank top tier so when I'm here salute me
Never fall off but if we do I'll win
And drop tens 'til they screaming Mikey Rocks again
Got some clothes from the Hundreds that I copped on a binge
Because my shoes, shirt, hat, and my socks from them
And I lived over the world close to Hollywood now
I ain't leaving 'til our name shining bright from the ground
Just trying to get my weight up
Guaranteed to stay down
And y'all ain't making noise
All you do is make sounds
They talk a lot had to put 'em in they place
Mines first, thank me later medal golden like my state
Your angel is sitting with me probably rubbing on my face
You just crossed the city limits nigga welcome to LA
