[Hook: Ash Riser]
I used to think this was impossible
Now I realize that I'm on top the world
Hey
The moon cries, we go out to sunset
Show face, fake smile act important
No cover charge bitch what you're thinking
Spit your game and state your reasons
I'm inside you, act like you don't know
Oh
I'ma just have to go out on my own
Oh
You're the type that goes out every weekend with your fucked up friends
Us, we're making nothing into something
No conversations

[Verse 1: Papo]
She called my on my phone and said she missed me
And she love me and she always thinking of me
But she moved on cause I would do wrong
Yeah I fucked up, I tried to lie about it
So she wouldn't cry about
But she knew the truth anyway
So I just manned up and told her about the other day
Yeah, told her about the other day

I used to think this was impossible
Now I realize that I'm on top the world
Hey
The moon cries, we go out to sunset
Show face, fake smile act important
No cover charge me what you're thinking
Spit your game and state your reasons

[Verse 2: Mike G]
Beautiful disaster, more beautiful than child laughter
She lives with intentions of the word spelled backwards
With the veil over her face she couldn't mask it
If they ever ask you, you was just an attachment
Still any instance you're the baddest at this plastic, still stagnant
For me not to pass was an accident
For you tripping is a habit, almost automatic
Sunshine got my heart beating like it's drumline
Sometimes I can't help but to rhyme
I know your mind wanders around to find numbers behind
Motives to invade my privacy
A common thief as this is what you say to me
Saying "Hold me, save me, baby
Lay to the days end
Maybe stay for me lately
You've been waiting patient
"Hold me, save me, baby
Lay to the days end
And maybe stay for me lately
You've been waiting patient"
We can go deeper than oceans
Lakes as we float in, skate in motion placement
"Hold me, save me, baby
Lay to the days end
And maybe stay for me
Stay for me..."
