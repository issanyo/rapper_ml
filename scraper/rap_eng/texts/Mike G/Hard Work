[Verse 1]
I caught your teardrops with my shoulder when you cried
I called in sick so I could comfort you all night
Now you've got cold feet, well just let me break the ice
I did your laundry and I folded it real nice
So, baby, why?

[Chorus]
(I put in the hard work)
Now I’m defeated, face down in the dirt
(I put in the hard work)
And I can’t seem to climb out of this hurt
(I put in the hard work)
If it’s true that you get what you deserve
(I put in the hard work)
Then why?
(I put in the hard work)

[Verse 2]
I held your hair back when you had too much to drink
I used my bare hands to unclog that bathroom sink
When you got de-pressed and your mind was on the blink
I peeled you off the floor and drove you to a shrink
C’mon, baby, why?

[Chorus]
(I put in the hard work)
Now I’m defeated, face down in the dirt
(I put in the hard work)
And I can’t seem to climb out of this hurt
(I put in the hard work)
If it’s true that you get what you deserve
(I put in the hard work)
Then why?
(I put in the hard work)

[Verse 3]
I know it’s painful to become a butterfly
You have to break yourself before your wings can fly
But still, I wonder when I look up at the sky
If this ain’t hell then where does love go when it dies?
Cuz baby, I...

[Chorus x2]
(I put in the hard work)
Now I’m defeated, face down in the dirt
(I put in the hard work)
And I can’t seem to climb out of this hurt
(I put in the hard work)
If it’s true that you get what you deserve
(I put in the hard work)
Then, God, what'd I do to deserve this curse?

(I put in the hard work)
(I put in the hard work)
Now I can’t seem to climb out of this hurt
(I put in the hard work)
I know it's worthless, but for what it's worth
(I put in the hard work)
I put in the hard work
