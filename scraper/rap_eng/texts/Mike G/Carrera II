I spit with the passion of the Christ when he stand wit me
Life's a game of love and war, everyone's a casualty
I just want to heal em all
Tell me why they mad at me
You lucky that I let you breath
But on the trill Keep my energy, dreaming
Constantly scheming
Calling treason on any nigga giving me a reason
I'm a king and I know you heard life ain't what it seems
Hold my wings. Come fly with me. Yeah

Found the recipe, had to bring it back to the kitchen
I became a building pillar you can put me In position
I went through this shit believing that my sins would be forgiven
I been schooling niggas, now I'm back to charge tuition
Let's go. Take a second just to catch the scheme
Dare he say it, getting cream was nothing but a dream
Vince told me the cops are the biggest gang he's ever seen
I don't do it for props, I just had to set the scene
And I got family out in Florida that won't move for anything
I'm out in Georgia in the field, mobbin' with the team
And down south, baby said "Cash Money everything"
So what's a hometown hero to a legion? Please believe em

Porsches, Benzes, Audis, Lexus'
Ill fuck around and put my logo on a necklace
Everything I bought don't equate to what i made
Put it together. See, that's just the sum of my investments
Endless testing, answers, questions
Anything hot will be my collection
Ain't it interesting that cops come in arresting
So we gotta look to the block for protection
You know excellence is my preference
The most known secret weapon like 007 is
I ain't hit the charts yet, so I'm trynna step in
With a record so clean it pass white glove inspection
