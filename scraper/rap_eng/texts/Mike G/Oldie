[Mike G]
What the fuck is caution?
Often I leave 'em flossing in KAWS, exes next to coffins
Lost in translation, the dreams you chase
Got you diving for the plates like you stealing home base
That's great, I'm home alone dreaming of two on ones
With Rihanna and Christina Milian, bring it on
And Travis is in the closet organizing and hanging the tramp
Three lettermans that Ace has been making him
No strays while we catching matinees, huh?
I'm getting blazed thinking 'bout those days
I had the top off the GT3 like toupees
One finger in the air, all's fair when crime pays
My grand scheme of things is to be attached
To the game like bitches to their wedding rings
And you don't even need to look cause we gleam obscene
In the light, ride slow to my yellow diamond shining
Like the Batman logo over Gotham, rock LA to Harlem
If you say "Get 'em Mike G" then I got 'em
One man squadron, nigga I'm a problem
From Briggs I got bars and plans to
Pimp these Polish bitches into pop stars
Humanity kills, we all suffer from insanity still
And if I said it then it is or it's gonna be real
OF 'til I OD and I probably will, uh
Study me autopsy reveals
I'll be the only nigga to die from being too real
You're prolly trynna find your style still
I'm tryna find chicks that look like del Rio in Brazil
What's crazy is At this rate see
I'm advancing so fast I think technolodgy hates me
No one ever really though I was great
Now I'm trynna see how far a couple features will take me
Don't hate haste but I appreciate patience
Military raised I raid bases and stations
That's real but I know how it feels
When Satisfactions like you don't even know how you waited
From now on dates dont matter I'm timeless
They waitin for the day to come when I don't rhyme sick
Envy the way I think cuz you can't buy this
I know where their mind is nowhere near where mine is
Come to me to get some air in your lungs
I get it done, What you need is what I stock in sums
I have excess, so each release is like dropping a bomb
To leave you concious, Never Delerious, I'm a mysterious one
Sixth sense has me thinking I'm prone to none
And visually has me thinking as life is Playstation
If I was one I'd overheat I'm so on
So gone, so rad, with a bad bitch with timbs on
Her Wardrobe consist of Versace and Louboutin
Got more trees than hemp cons
Main reason people listen to my songs
Is 'cuz I'm a God damn American Icon
They planned against me they couldn't be more wrong
I never hate opinions 'cuz they can do no harm
I go on and on my bars sicker than yours
Get claps for my cars I drive around in applause
I tell her only look back if you do it for me
And Jack Frost so cold you must maneuver with skis
Just believe I do it with ease, do what you please
You've been looking for me I've been flying over seas
I've been isolated on islands
I deserve a chick that's not a dime shes a diamond
It's no news, if you contest who rules, You lose
Step up Every week in new shoe's I cruise
Every chick is like damn he's smooth
I need rocks that weigh me down I can't stand these jewels
How real is that. My oldest games are still in tact
Stand out from the back, I'm like the champagne of rap
I'm that nice, decline if you can't pay that price
I pop up like reflex sights hold up
Black diamonds you can see in the night
No luck to those that are green with envy
I'm simply, breed to win see
Entry was a decade before turn of the century
So I'm a hundred and ten percent
Most classic Best to rule most cool most authentic
I could prolly come up with limitless sentences
But I don't talk much unless you're list-en-ing
Your efforts are as futile as resistance is
But My rhymes accessories Live, I'm a different being
Spectacle low and behold I'm quite something to see
If I'm not the best I'm the person the best want's to be
So anytime I hear them talk I feel they're talking bout me
And Ya voice ain't got enough bass
Skinny nigga but my name holds a lot of weight
I spend my days looking for something to fill my plate
Candles get blown when we get baked
And it's not even my birthday I want the whole cake
No need for lawyers. It's never up for debate They hate, I'm doing great
We can orchestrate one band one sound
But if any nigga play then it's one man down
Lyrically, I'm past borderline mastermind
I don't think there's another nigga like me in this time
I work smart and hard buy it like why wait
The closest thing I had to a job was 08
So since 09 I professionally rhymed
With poise and stance
And that year my favorite model won Miss France
That's just motivation to put every doubter in urns I hope that they never learn
So I can I'll Spit fire till they're overly burned
I play till I'm finished I don't take turns
Kill quick but I'm still screamin' die slow bitch
'Cuz I'm so Malicious like dude from the Clipse is
Lame niggas speak relentless some might be right but fact is
They're on forums and I'm on flights
Vanish fast like places we pass when our mind roams
Hit gas give whiplash til we arrive home
I need theme music no way I'm entering alone
So I'm bumpin oldies off my cellular phone
