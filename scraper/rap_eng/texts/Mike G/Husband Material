[Verse 1]
You got a look in your eyes
Just like an independent movie
You say I'm husband material
But you never wanna go steady

[Verse 2]
And what a shame it is
I never took you out to the theater
I got some style, got the drive
Just don't got much money buried in my blue denim jeans

[Verse 3]
I wish you talked about me like you used to
I wish I was your guy
I still drive twice a week to Chicago
You know I only work nights

[Verse 4]
I wanna take you to the show tomorrow
I wanna make things right
I take back everything I said to you
Last night
