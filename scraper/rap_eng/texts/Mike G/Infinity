[Verse 1: Jack Mushroom]

So far ahead this shit's ridiculous
Friends acting suspicious, bitch being promiscuous
I'm living in the age of the hipster kids
Where everyone claims to be a real nigga or musician
It's like nothing in this world makes sense to me
That's why I blow trees to put my head where it was meant to be
In space on the moon where these humans can't get to me
I'm what these lames pretend to be
A real nigga, literally

[Hook: Jack Mushroom]

Infinity and beyond is what my mind be on
You'll never catch me
Shrooms, shrooms, shrooms
Infinity and beyond is what my mind be on
You'll never catch me
Shrooms, shrooms, shrooms

[Verse 2: Mike G]

Abide by no rules, glow in the dark shoes
Wings pop out it's just part of my outfit
Back when they ain't give a damn I ran the star command
My fingers aimed to them I'm shooting lasers from my hands
With diamonds upon my wrists I rule with an iron fist
And ride in something so big a missile couldn't miss
But you can't shoot me down, I rhyme forever
I'm heaven in flight; Legendary, Apollo 11
If you follow me there's nowhere we can't go
Trust in me like I trust my light yellow gold
Achieve impossible with things I had to do without
And I can probably count to an infinite amount
You don't listen to this, that's ignorance
I say nothing to all these bitches that keep pushing my buttons
Long gone, my Armstrong ran compete with a million to one
But I'm second to none; Mike G

[Verse 3: Jack Mushroom]

Forever shining I'm timeless like diamonds
You're in the presence of royalty say hi to your highness
Highas; an understatement to where my fucking mind is
Not even Jesus Christ's guidance can help you find it
I'm a warrior, something like Leonidas
Sliced up more rivals than Hayabusa in Ninja Gaiden
I'm the nicest flow legendary so they recite this
But if they bite this turn they black into the Dark Knight Rises
I'm the king of the jungle with the heart of a lion
Eyes of a tiger voice of a god you can't despise us
It's Odd Future, we're deeper than the Teen Titans
Animals bizarre the worlds never seen anything like us
And you can keep looking at me as the outcast
But I bet a mil' I'll outlast your mark ass

[Hook]
