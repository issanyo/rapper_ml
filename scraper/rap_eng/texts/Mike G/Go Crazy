[Intro: Junked]
Yeah
Let's talk about some crazy shit man..
Mike*G, M.Vegas, Canalli
Yeah

[Verse  1: Mike*G]
Still a independent artist
Still killing shit
B roll that blunt up
Let me get hit
We in the south-side
Tatted like a Mexican
Swerving lane 2 lane
Fucking with pedestrians
I'm a veteran
Fly in my letterman
Dudes sleeping on me
Like David and Goliath and them
Doing the c-walk
Fucking with them Compton crips
Drinking old E
Looking like a caught a lick
My b's throw it up
Now where them sets at
Never give a bird bread
Or cheese to a rat
Dub stepping
With that 44 Cadillac
I'm going nuts like a crackerjack
Dip that blunt cognac
Meet me on the east
That phone might be tapped
Out in LA
Them fruittown niggas strapped
Mad dog 20 20
On a diet
My pockets hella chunky
Blow the chronic nigga
Sipping on gin & juice
Going crazy
Gifted Rebel
Is the label that's pays me
Junked hit me up
Said we going brazy
The chronic got me high
Swear I'm getting lazy
Fresh chucks and dickey khaki's
Bandana on my backside
But it ain't the crip side
Snoop dogg
In my low ride
We westside certified
Got these niggas by a slandside

[Hook: M.Vegas]
Man This shit go crazy
When you hear that beat banging
My homies really about it
Yeah they twisting up fingers
This shit go crazy
The way we living so amazing
Rolling up that OG
And we flexing so outrageous
This shit go crazy
You with some real dam players
Don't bring that girl around
Because we just might take her
This shit go crazy
And can't nobody play us
And can't nobody fade us

[Verse  2: Canalli]
Pull up to the spot
Make them heads turn
New red bottoms
Made the floor burn
My bitch so bad
Make ya neck hurt
And she gimme head
While I make
That fucking thang swerve
Make my wrist drip
When I grip grain
Boy I made a new hit
Thats a new chain
Boy I hit a new bitch
Had her back sprained

Jewels on my body
Stedy drippin like its agua
Bitches hear my name
And they pop it like its nada
