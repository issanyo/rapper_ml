You been obedient. I been lenient
The coupe double cup. You see me lean in it
I ain't preaching it. Bitch be appreciative
Keep it secretive won't front like I don't know ya
Girl with them eyes I do what you wanna
I say hypnotize she say controlla
It's like She know everything I love
Rockstar speedin off from the midnight club. Even though the whip clean she wreckless
She break a block down drop it make a line disappear like Tetris
Cocky puttin on my best Kanye west impression
Cruising sections trynna add a Barbie bitch to my collection
I forgot mention to hail to the chief when I step in
See that's presidential shit I had to dress for the election, yo

[Hook]
It's bittersweet how you don't listen
Tonight, we need to see them bad intentions
You been obedient. I been lenient
The coupe, double cup. You see me lean in it

Niggas in Hollywood reaching for a role
Jack Frost but you gon regret leaving me in the cold
Hit the house with black mask when the cops at the door
And say the black man rob watch a nigga say woah
Pete Maravich with the 44
Dial up soldiers. creepin up slow
Give me the drop like she do it for radio
Turn the bed to a Carnival and put on a freak show
I know, there's no way that you can be the hardest without sum'n
That'll make em get up like graffiti artist
So fairly.. imma do it til they obey me
Jewels on my neck, smile on my face straight to the bank, see

[Hook]
It's bittersweet how you don't listen
Tonight we need to see those bad intentions
You been obedient. I been lenient
The coupe double cup. You see me lean in it
It's bittersweet how you don't listen
Tonight we need to see those bad intentions
You been obedient. I been lenient
The coupe double cup. You see me lean in it

We took the long route. I'm talking scenic shit
Son came from fire. I'm talking Phoenix shit
I'm what danger is that Michael Jackson
Chief when I'm rappin uh, I'm bout that action
