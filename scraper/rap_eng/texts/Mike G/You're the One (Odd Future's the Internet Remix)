[Chorus 1: Charli XCX]
Dancing in the darkness
Pink and lilac
Keep the silence
Crystals on the skyline
Cut to midnight
Ultraviolet

[Chorus 2: Charli XCX]
Flying through the black night
You’re the angel in the moonlight
Running through the thunder
Undercover
Silver lover

[Verse 1: Mike G]
Yeah, now you're thinkin' what have I gotten myself in?
How can I extend this situation?
I can't see how this'll end, while other's contin
You just wanted a friend
But I can make you feel like you'll never need them again
I hope they go with the wind
Way past far
No way anyone could ever tell where we are
Freeze to make you stay
Raise fires to keep them away
Keep a quick pace to make sure
Others must admire from a distance
I could make you wanna love me in an instant
Too nice, nicer than they are
But I learned being too nice won't get you too far
Explore everywhere on you
The journey can't hurt
Dominate every place, that's just how kings work
No commitment, no goal, no model
Wrong role, role models played a role
No shadow, no soul, let's go

[Verse 2: Charli XCX]
Yeah, I’m dancing in the darkness
Three years before I was feeling so heartless
But your burn shined through
Now I’m drinking love potion when I lay next to you
It’s a criminal feeling
Happiness cries when the tears are dreaming
My body is screaming
I’m staying right here, no, I’ll never be leaving

[Chorus 1: Charli XCX]
Dancing in the darkness
Pink and lilac
Keep the silence
Crystals on the skyline
Cut to midnight
Ultraviolet
