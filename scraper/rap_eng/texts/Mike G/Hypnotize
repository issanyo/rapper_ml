[Intro]
Yeah, uh, yeah

[Hook]
My ride, hypnotize, switch it, move it side to side
My ride, hypnotize, switch it, move it side to side
Roll up my supply, I can't open up my eyes
Drop the roof, hold it down
Tell them haters I'm alive

[Verse 1: Mike G]
Give what you got cause I give it my best
All eyes on me like presidential addresses
I won't be impressed if you step in my section
Cuz my crew stay wreckin, official as ref's is
They checkin my stats like they checking for sports
Sit back and adore, I check in resorts
Money I'm making it stretch and contort
Jack Frost, I'm checking the weather report
That's fire, I'm making it work like the Fourth
Sit here and soak in this story of sorts
I'm a king as I sit on my throne
I made it my home I'm running this court
I get ghost hop up then I coast
Knock down decorations as i'm ducking patrol cops
Riding dirty I'm 24k
Speeding in broad day, And I don't stop at road blocks
See I let them say what they say
Cuz in life know you get no replays
Though these elequant scriptures are delivered on stage
When they write the next testament, I want a page

[Hook]
My Ride, hypnotize, switch it, move it side to side
My ride, hypnotize, switch it, move it side to side
Roll up my supply, I can't open up my eyes
Drop the roof, hold it down
Tell them haters I'm alive

[Verse 2: Trae Tha Truth]
Everything over when Truth say the word
I am the one at green lights you get served
King of the streets, I might ride on the curb
And I'm sick of this hater shit working my nerves
No need for it plus i got bitches watchin
I get new haters daily no other option
When I finish these hoes, they up for adoption
Then I burn with these speakers that's playing boxing
In my new D9 i'm looking fresh and cool
I get so much head you think I stay in school
All this ice on my nigga, I been a fool
Gotta maintain the block so I keep a tool
In the back of this bourbon, everything urban
I'm talking black when I pull up and splurge
Ballin on niggas, Truth really is servin
Play you, might get your head wrapped like a turban
I'm the man. I ain't looking like nothing different
But a bunch of money and a bunch of game
And a bunch of whips with a bunch of chips
And a bunch of status when I do my thing

[Hook]
Ride, hypnotize, switch it, move it side to side
I ride, hypnotize, switch it, move it side to side
Roll up my supply, I can't open up my eyes
Drop the roof, hold it down
Tell them haters I'm alive
