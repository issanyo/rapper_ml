Don’t Run
Please young please don’t run
Please young G’s don’t run
Don’t squeeze no gun
Lettuce get cheese no bun
Please young we’z no fun
Please don’t run
Everybody scared of the booth
Everybody scared of the truth
Don’t run
Yeah (4x)
Don't run

[verse 1:]
I'll off ya top off the top off tops
Body coughing in a coffin momma callin the cops
It happens often they get to talking & callin the shots
They think they run it but they trippin & they fallin a lot
Give it all that i got
I spend the ball when I jot
Im in control you trolling
You posing as someone you not
I got a plot I'm plotting
Im cookin I'm holding the pot
Holding a conservation with the homie holding the Glock
Holding some heat & its hot
He kick the beat & it's hot
I know society hate me
I probably sleep with a dot
On my body from somebody prolly tweakin to pop
A bullet in me & put me deep in the ground like a crop
I need a crown when I drop
I'm coming down wit a mop
Flow so so clean & it's icy as wop
If I ain't checkin the numbers
Then tell me why would I flop
I love the life that I'm living
So tell me why would I swap, stop

[verse 2:]
If they ain't feeling what you spittin
Tell em kick rocks
I be spitting dope
Putting lyrics in the zip locks
Never picked locks
But I'm cracking the code
Flow crack fell back
But I'm back in the mode
Black & im bold
I'm lackin what you stackin & fold
Lackin' some gold
I need a plaque rapping this cold
Cuz black backpack rapping hardly ever get sold
It hardly ever gets old
What if I never explode, gotta reload
I'm taking a shot
Even on the road know I'm taking the pot
I gotta cook cooking something hot
Something you not
Everybody fitting in I said I'm making a spot
I said I'm, I said I'm making a spot
& if you sleeping on me then I'm making a cot
Stay sleep, & if you just a follower follow & stay sheep
Everytime I say what I'm saying it stay deep I don't play deep
