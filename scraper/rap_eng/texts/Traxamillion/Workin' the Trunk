[Verse 1: E-40]
I came in this thing outta here, loaded, hella bent
Intoxicated, everywhere I go I leave my scent
I’m hella faded, who got some gum or a mint?
My jewelry decorated, my diamonds shaped like a tent
I can’t tell you what I spent, if I told ya, I’d have to kill ya
I’ve been smoking hella hemp like a soldier, I’m off to kill
About my skrilla, I’m ‘bout that world, ‘bout that life
We sick like salmonella, crooked cops, crooked dice (UH!)
She bad as fuck and she nasty
Popping pills like Nurse Jackie
Pussy opposite of flabby
Brazilian wax, not nappy
From the beginning and since day two, I’ve been winning
Fuck social media, in the hood, I’m trending
Better show up, that’s what I tell a bitch
Have her hoe up, then I sell a bitch

[Chorus 2X]
Workin’ the trunk
Bitch got junk
Hood nigga, always park my whip in the front
Hoe ass niggas getting mad ‘cause we stunt
Running through money, you could say what you want

[Verse 2: Too $hort]
She dancing with an attitude
By herself, must be mad at dude (She mad at you)
‘Cause she came with her man
Fuck that cupcake, she just wanna dance
So exotic, she from the island
Dancing erotic, sexy and violent
I ain’t never seen shit like that
Make you wanna hit that cat
She ain’t doing new dances I ain’t ever seen
But the way she do ‘em is hella mean
Hips look dangerous
She’s sexy, but she’s an angry bitch
I’m from the O, that’s my kind of hoe
Told her “Grab my arm, it’s time to go
You wanna have fun, right?
I’ma fuck you all night ‘til you see the sunlight”

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
[E-40]
UH!
She a fool wit’ it, niggas don’t be knowin’ what to do wit’ it
Pack a tool wit’ it, bitches might wanna cool it
She’s a bad bitch, came out breech
She ain’t off the chain, she off the leash
A thick chick, love dick, pussy and tits
Big hips, big lips, good ass sex
Get her off the weed and the heem
Pussy have you sprung like a Slinky spring

[Too $hort]
Too much for the average player
All the weak ass niggas just pay her
Begging, ‘Please don’t embarrass me’
Down on one knee, ‘Please marry me’
She wild as fuck, can’t tell her nothin’
Freaky as hell when you fuckin’
But she a crazy bitch when you pull it out
Make you wanna keep it in her mouth
BITCH!

[Chorus]

[Outro: E-40]
She bad, bad, bad, bad, bad, bad, bad, bad
She got ass, ass, ass, ass, ass, ass, ass, ass
And her own cash, cash, cash, cash, cash, cash, cash, cash
She spaz, spaz, spaz, spaz, spaz, spaz, spaz, spaz
Shake that weave (Repeat 4X)
Where the bitches with the real hair? (Repeat 4X)
Shake that weave (Repeat 4X)
Where the bitches with the real hair? (Repeat 4X)
BIATCH!
