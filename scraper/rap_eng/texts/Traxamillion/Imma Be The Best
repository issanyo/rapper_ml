HOOK:
Everyday I live my life
I push against the grain
Up against all of my odds
Only I can feel the pain
And I grind for the fortune
Till the crowd screams out my name
Ima be the..,i'ma be the..

THAI:
Its all about the dough tho
You know fo sure tho
We all international while ya stay local
And ima get money like the homies in San Jo
Do anything we want
Give a fuck if its illegal
Check like D-Bo
Coming thru repo
Heart of a soldier, fly high like an eagle
Ride for my people, its just how it goes
Stay on my toes, ahead of my foes
I got it in control, take a hit and let it blow
Im on top of the world, staring out this window
And everything ive been thru, made me stronger mental
Ain't nuthin easy, we just make it look simple
Credentials I got it, pistols ive poped it
Shows ive rocked it now im rollin with the mobstas
Homie party like a rockstar, but dont get it twisted im a gangsta first and foremost

HOOK

2ND VERSE:
Call me the medical
Flow so hysterical
Been in the streets with the gangstas and the criminals
You know I live this shit now
Im on a mission to stack a fuckin million
Head high to the ceiling
Posted like a street light
Living in the street life
Knowing thangs gona be right so I grind all day all night
Until the time comes, homie we gona get it
And even when we make it, we gona still get it in
Ima a rider rider, ghetto survivor - vivor
Posted with them thangs right beside us
If you want to run up, you know where to find us
Ain't no body hiding, you'll get lit up like a lighter
Im bringing it, all ya bitches singing it
You dont know nothing till you mothafuckas seen this shit
And we've been in this shit, hold it down and stackin grips
Up in the studio everyday makin hits
