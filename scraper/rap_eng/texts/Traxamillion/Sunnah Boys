[Verse 1: Freeway]
I took Shahada down the street from the bus stop
My Ahki Hanif got killed with a buckshot
How ironic he used to walk around with the one shot gauge
Crowd mover, my shooters
Really shoot, give me the loot
I'm like D-O, I got that ride or die music
I solemnly swear to stay in the zone
And if y'all niggas not zonin', y'all can follow me there
Come on, Free and Jacka, Hus in back of
Trust in Allah and we trust in our strappers
Kush in the Backwoods, whenever I go
Back and forth I feel like I'm going backwards
We're all rappers, they're all actors
If they don't pray five times they're all kafirs
Try to come at us you must be losing touch
You will get smoked like a Dutch by the master
Actually a slave of the master but I'm gettin' paid
If a bastard wanna try me, hit 'em with the gauge
Won't stop till a nigga rest in the grave
Like Jay Z and Em, I'm a renegade

[Hook: Freeway]
Sunnah Boys, we them boys
If you want drama then bring the noise
We do this, East Coast to West Coast
Philly to the Bay, L.A. to Illinois
Sunnah Boys, we them boys
If you want drama then bring the noise
We do this all around the world
From Africa to Asia, Australia to Singapore

[Verse 2: Killer Mike]
I'm saying Assalamu Alaikum as I'm twisting up a Vega
As I'm dipping up the block tellin' the Ahks I'll see 'em later
Walaikum Assalam is how the bro respond
We grippin' each others palm and wishing peace upon
The pigs in the street and they moving like beasts
So keep your woman covered and always keep the piece/peace
My partner got pinched and converted, now that's the rumor
My boy beat a murder and now I'll see him in Jumaa
And now it's only ? Muhammad ? for his junior
He got a second chance and got him a second life
I'm jokin' he so rich he might get him a second wife
Insha'Allah is what he said, but really man I'm alright
He gave me some game before I exit the door
Told me he gave up the streets, Allah gave him a store
If you're faithful to Allah, and it's bigger than just a beard
He'll make you a Mansa Musa or a Sunni Ali Ber
G'yeah!

[Verse 3: The Jacka]
Ecuador, pray we see many more
Give a lot back, can't forget the fact we were poor
Seems I'm falling off track ever since I cut my Sunnah ?
They say "you're following Islam but how can you be so sure?"
I say "Allah makes the Muslim to send us out to reach the world
All we do is idol worship when we try and teach ourselves"
We needed lessons so he sent the scrolls to Jibra'il
That's Gabriel, back then the prophets couldn't read a scale
The Kafirs gathering wondering how could this be real?
The King was enraged hearing slaves were equal to him
Brutally murder Muslims cause Islam got under his skin
He was running away from truth only to become one in the end
Islam, the truth taught me to become one with my fam
Salaat to save me cause Allah doesn't need our prayer
Worship towards the clouds hoping one day you will be up there
Praying facing the stars thinking maybe there's a God in there
