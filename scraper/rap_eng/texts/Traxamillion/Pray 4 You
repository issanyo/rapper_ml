Traxamillion

[Chorus]
What do you want?
Do you really want, in ya life? (Hus, Hus, Hus)
And when you feel what ya lookin' for
What you asking for, do you think you'll survive?
The Mac want survive, naw, naw, naw
What do you want?
What do you really, really, really want, in ya life? In ya life
And when you feel what you lookin' for
What ya askin' 'bout, do you think you'll survive?
You think you'll survive? (Hus, Hus, Hus)

[Verse 1]
So what cha talkin'? What's the real?
Where ya at homeboy? How you feel?
I'm stupid, dumb, some MOB shit straight from the field
Look at my face bitch I'm so fuckin' ill
Oh yes, oh yes, oh yes, funky fresh, in the flesh
Two hunnid thou-wow, on molly's in ya face
Listen to, listen to this mothafuckin' bass
I'm so on, hold on I'm goin' back to space
I think I left somethin', a haters last breath or somethin'
What cha lookin' for? Some bread? If ya deaf I'm dumpin'
Feelin' like I'm sexin' somethin', he scared to death of Hus
Husalah Hus, you even hate to hear it huh?
Thirty dicks and shit, this is just arithmetic
Listen to this shit, it's really real life, bitch
Thirty dicks and shit, this is just arithmetic
Listen to this shit, it's really real life, bitch

[Chorus]
What do you want?
Do you really want, in ya life? (Hus, Hus, Hus)
And when you feel what ya lookin' for
What ya asking for, do you think you'll survive?
The Mac want survive, naw, naw, naw
What do you want?
What do you really, really, really want, in ya life? In ya life
And when you feel what you lookin' for
What ya askin' 'bout, do you think you'll survive?
You think you'll survive? (Hus, Hus, Hus)

[Verse 2]
Okay we back to the future, it seems so strange
Like I'm half-way deranged between a preacher and a shoota
Uh oh, oh, oh this is how it feel when you're oh so on
I'm in another world
I started movin' the stuff the same color as mother pearl
Now haters wanna take me home
180 MPH let's move on
It's not a lot of time
A lot of them had a lot of styles, but a lot was mine
I'm outer space, only a place, upon Allah can find
Another threshold, another level be, but definitely
Another we will never be as dope as me
You'll never see, unless a king forever be
The Husalah is the dopest

[Pre-Chorus]
What do you want?
What do ya, do ya, do ya
What do you want?
What do ya, do ya, do ya

[Chorus]
What do you want?
Do you really want, in me life? (Hus, Hus, Hus)
And when you feel what ya lookin' for
What ya asking for, do you think you'll survive?
The Mac want survive, naw, naw, naw
What do you want?
What do you really, really, really want, in ya life? In ya life
And when you feel what you lookin' for
What ya askin' 'bout, do you think you'll survive?
You think you'll survive? (Hus, Hus, Hus)

[Outro]
Husalah, Hus, Hus, Hus
Husalah, Hus, Hus, Hus
