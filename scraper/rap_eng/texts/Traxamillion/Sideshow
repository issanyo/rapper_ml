[Verse 1: Too $hort]
A yo Trax let me see what you got
I don't rap if the beat don't knock
I need bass, make it fast, every girl in the place shaking ass
Yea that's that bayshit
Give it to her good, that pussy stay wet
I know what you want bitch
You hooked on slap, you want that funk shit
Well holla at Traxamillion
But don't fall in love and start catching feelings
He won't love you back, why would he?
Flipped her and had a sideshow in her pussy
We don't stop doing donuts
Nothing gon change when the police show up
Burning rubber in the streets of Oakland (bitch!)
What are you smoking?

[Hook: Mistah F.A.B and Too Short]
Go go go dumb at the sideshow, what are you smoking? (x3)
Go go go dumb at the sideshow, Thizz!

[Verse 2: Mistah F.A.B.]
The sideshow, they wanna shut us down
But we a'swang something on every corner in the town
Police mad, the streets is wild
3 o'clock in the morning and the beats is loud
Man, it don't stop, won't stop, never would
Somebody gon swang something in every hood
They profile with 'cuds and stangs
Now a days niggas'll swang anything
Boxes, Buicks, buckets and Chevys
Driving hella fast like Mario Andretti
A hundred down the block on the other side
Only time they slow down when they ghost ride
When they hop out the car, walk and steer
And then thizz face like they sippin bitter beer
The sideshow 2006, ain't nothing like it was when Richie Rich

[Hook]
