(Traxamillion)
Mistah F.A.B

[Verse 1]
This one for the king of the super duper
Keak get well, we gon' shit like a pooper scooper
I'm ridin' for you, brodie, like a super Uber
Super Soaker on deck, we got stupid shooters
Far as hyphy go, I ain't gon' let it die
Couldn'ta left it in the hands of a better guy
Fetty Wap on the game, lookin' with my better eye
Tech grind, Chevron gas, unleaded, ah
Turned back up like a nigga never turned down
Hyphy like when a hood nigga get turned down (Fuck you, bitch)
From a bad bitch, fuck a bitch, I get the bag quick
Still cheezy-weezy, broke niggas on that mad shit
Bitch said she over me, then why the hell you textin' then?
Brodie actin' like a bitch, too much estrogen
"Fabby Davis, oh my god, you're back, yo, we love you!"
We on that hyphy shit again, uhhh, fuck you

[Chorus]
Yadadamean, fo' sho, yadadamean, fo' sheezy
This that '06 slap, you beezy
In the building and I'm feelin' like yee!
Can't kill hyphy like Keak Da Sneak
Still (Keep it super duper, can't kill hyphy)
Still (Super, duper, duper, duper, can't kill hyphy)
I'm still (Super, duper, duper, duper, can't kill hyphy)
Super-duper-duper-duper-duper-duper hyphy

[Verse 2]
Hey, I don't think they know, they some nerds
Shaboobalaboopy, that's my word
Did on my first win what niggas don't do until their third
Hyphy ain't dead, them niggas just scared
Hands on the clock gettin' turned back
Year 2006, where the herb at?
The Bay fell off?  Nigga what?  I heard that
Been gettin' lit, tell the world we want our word back (litty)
Niggas switch cliques, ride dick just to get on
Serve out of town ways, this The Town, don't forget home
I'm so Oakland like Cindy on Soul Beat
Gingerbread House, Carijama, and LG
Now tell 'em don't stop, keep goin', keep goin'
Off champagne and cookies, I'm blowin', I'm blowin'
Hold it down for the Bay reppin' Oakland
Still super-duper hyphy, you know it

[Chorus]
Yadadamean, fo' sho, yadadamean, fo' sheezy
This that '06 slap, you beezy
In the building and I'm feelin' like yee!
Can't kill hyphy like Keak Da Sneak
Still (Keep it super duper, can't kill hyphy)
Still (Super, duper, duper, duper, can't kill hyphy)
I'm still (Super, duper, duper, duper, can't kill hyphy)
Super-duper-duper-duper-duper-duper hyphy

[Verse 3]
'06, this was big, no Bed-Stuy
Boy, I'm on your neck, to the neck, like a necktie
Just left my nigga Keak, crackin' jokes by his bedside
He said "Fabby, burn them niggas down like Left Eye"
So I'm back in the building like I forgot somethin'
Put your hands up like I'm 'bout to pop somethin'
Niggas ain't hyphy, they really need to stop frontin'
They really ain't shooters, 'cause niggas ain't dropped nothin'
Put a pill in your life, change your attitude
I kept the door open, nigga, where's the gratitude?
Man, what is it? Why you mad at dude?
Boy, I'm just doin' what I had to do (What you do?)
Bay on my back like Bubbles on Mike Jack
Hyphy comin' back, a couple suckas ain't gonna like that
I'm Han Solo, you know I had to strike back
Rest in peace to The Mac and The Jack, Keak be right back

[Chorus]
Yadadamean, fo' sho, yadadamean, fo' sheezy
This that '06 slap, you beezy
In the building and I'm feelin' like yee!
Can't kill hyphy like Keak Da Sneak
Still (Keep it super duper, can't kill hyphy)
Still (Super, duper, duper, duper, can't kill hyphy)
I'm still (Super, duper, duper, duper, can't kill hyphy)
Super-duper-duper-duper-duper-duper hyphy

Hyphy
Hyphy
Hyphy
Hyphy
Super-duper-duper-duper-duper-duper hyphy
Hyphy
