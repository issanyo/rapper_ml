[Hook: Scott McKenzie - San Francisco sample]

[Verse 1: Big Rich]

Rep' my city, nobody flyer
Say something different, you a goddamn liar
Block on fire, streets stay cooking
Girl you looking for a boyfriend then keep on looking
Downtown Fillmore something like Brooklyn
Uptown, Harlem, yeah we ballin'
Frisco Frisco, home of the brave
I don't know about y'all, but we getting paid
All over TV, still ain't changed
Good in the hood everywhere I go
Got a block full of hitters everywhere I go
Say you from the hood, but you never lived though
HP love me
Lakeview love me
Sunnydale, Towerside, lets get money
Bang Bang three story game this movement
Street Cred music, son lets do it!

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Boo Banga]

It's a city situation
I keep Hunters Point, any equation
I'm married to the block, you just got relations
And you gon' need a doctor, you play with my patience
You hating, you can get it in broad day
My neck shines like the lights on Broadway
Never gave a broad away
Cause in Fillmore they get it to pay
But HP, that be me
Check my street cred, I'm in the trap all day
I just count the cash
Now whip bent like Alcatraz
And not one bar's a fable
We got the cable car, but my car got cable
Boo Banga, I'm on demand like Comcast
And with these squares, I don't contrast

[Hook]

[Verse 3: San Quinn]

City go by no book, anybody get took
From HP to Hayes Valley we push
Come over the top of the bridge
It gets narrow
Grip roll down riding on O'Farrell
Young Fillmore Fa-rel, Golden Gate treasure
Down in the Wharf, SF the letters
Roll in like fog, battle's up hill
You witness shit you will get killed
Coughnut, Mr. C, Hitman, R.I.P
Much love from the SFC
Handle bricks in the back of Candlestick
House in Twin Peaks, view panoramics
Still with the cannon, 40 or 50 Caliber
Five time champion, destroy any challenger
Hit like Barry, Score like Jerry
Still right here, Fillmore to marry

[Hook]
