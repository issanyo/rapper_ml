Chorus (Liz Stefano)

Verse 1 (Thai)
Now who are you to judge about my life
I sacarficed alot tryin to make things right
Late night on the phone with my kids back home
All the say is daddy why you always gone
I stay strong but im lyin if I tell you im not bothered
I rather be dead then be like my father
The choices I make is to provide for the feature
But the life that im living it got these people out to shoot ya
I never been a hater always treated them right
But ive always been hated thru out my life
An outcast underdog but will I prevail
When I make it to the top Ill have a story to tell
I never folded my cards
I played the hands that was dealt
When everbody left me all by myself
I never changed
But learned alot from it all
But I wouldve never learned if I didn't fall

Chorus (Liz Stefano)

Verse 2 (Thai)
I seen it all in a dream
All the diamond shinnin
Never had shit but felt like the world is mine
It my heart stayed real dont let them make me
Keep it 100 like my homie Drew Deezy
Been at the bottom to the top is the goal
Now I to make a statement every where that I go
They screamin out my name at all the shows
Like damn (damn) where the fuck the time all go
I used to be a kid posted up on the ave
Got my ass kicked comin back on them to blast
I never thought about the future
Always lived in the present
Now I think about the future cause it makes more sense
I stay focus
Never puttin down my gaurd
Got to watch for the snakes tryin to tear me apart
This is my life im a show you what its about
You say you down
Im a give you the benefit of the doubt and lets
