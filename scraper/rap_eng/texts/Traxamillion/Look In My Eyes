[Verse 1]
Even though
I told you I’m not perfect no not perfect (but I’m worth it)
You still say it couldn’t be the way it used to be (oh)
But baby, oh baby I still think you should look into my eyes
Cause in my eyes you’ll see the love is in there deep inside
The one you cannot leave behind
And now I want you to decide

[Chorus]
When you look in my eyes
What do you see
Am I still the same person
That I used to be
When you look in my eyes
Is the feeling still there
Should we still remain lovers?
Or do you still care?

[Verse 2]
Had me thinking I was still the only one
But now I see you’ve got another on your mind
It’s clear to me you know exactly what you want
Just hope she know I made you (c’mon man)
But I can have another you in a minute
And It’s all good cause boy It’s forgiven
Cause when It’s all said I’ll be winning
Yea ya know I slay homegirl she be killin’ (she be killin Yea)
Chuck my deuces up
Wish you best of luck
Promise on my heart I’m happy for the both of you
So DJ turn it up
And ladies come on down
Cause tonight we gon’ party ‘till the sun comes up

[Verse 3]
Oh Oh Oh Oh
Yea x5
When you look in my eyes
What do you see
Am I still the same girl that I used to be (that I used to be ohh)
Don’t sweat the small stuff
Not me no more (oh yea)
Livin’ the life where ya at young world

[Refrain] x3
Young world
Young life young
Young life young world
Where ya at young world?!

Look into my eyes
Oh baby x2
Look into my eyes
I know you hear

[Bridge]
Even though I was still your favorite girl x2

[Outro]
Where ya at young world!
