[HOOK] Traxamillion
I grew up in the slums
With nothing but my pride
My word and my gun
Scream into the sun
Is anybody out there?
Can anybody hear me?
As real as it comes
And I'm screamin at the the top of my lungs
I am not done
I am the one

[Verse 1] Thai
I sat and thought about it
Maybe I am the one
Assume that I was done
Really I've just begun
Now I'm brighter than the lights that u see when u welding
I'm higher then a new york sky scraper building
I'm the cream in the fillin
Trend setters so appealin
Sippin champane
With fine beautiful women
I'm feelin so live
Label me mr I-5
Affialiated wit the hustlers on the east side (san jo)
I'm so world wide
Feelin like its my time
New money and a new life
Like a butterfly
Look in my eyes
U can tell that I evolved
When everybody stalled
I wanted to problem solve
A rare gem founded
Now the world is astounded
I started up the fire
Now everybody surround it
Listen a story about
A father that left his son
And grew up in the slums
To somehow be the one

[Verse 2] Thai
I couldve been a statisitc
Either dead or in prison
But then my soul was lifted
Maybe I was born gifted
Who knows what their fate is
My fate is somethin better
I had the power in my hand to change my own weather
U could see me flyin by in that Murci√©lago
Ain't nothin change I'm still sippin Henny out the bottle
And now tomorrow is here
Time to get it started
Yesterday u was nothin
And now are somebody
Don't get me twisted
For one of these industry fake bitches
What u see is what u get
So go ahead and take a picture
Always been hated
But never faded
Highly motivated
To make it and make a statement
Everything put together like a puzzle
Trials and tribulations is something u got to go through
Don't let nobody show u
I'm here and my visions clear
I got my hands on the steering wheel now its time to steer
