HOOK
I dont see nothing wrong with us
Hangin out after we leave this club
If u leave with me we poppin
When im in you we ain't stoppin
We gona get it in we gona turn it up
Get a lil freaky when we leave this club
If you leave with me we poppin
When im in you we ain't stoppin
I dont see nothin, I dont see nothing wroong...

DREWS VERSE:
You see the bottles poppin
The party is riight here
My swag turned up im the player of the year
We can sip some champayne or down some xo
We can come in the ferrari or leave in the lambo
I ain't seen the little leagues, your boy I all pro
You can have wat u like, I ain't worried about the dough
Go head and tell the waiter that we need 5 more
This is all complimatory of 4.5.4
The time is 2:30, is you leaving with a boss?
Bring your girlfriends you dont gotta drop them off
Take them to the mansion they can all get lost
I live magnificent, somethin like Rick Ross
Pull out your camera phone, yeah ill take a picture
Update your facebook and put me on twitter
I make 'em say "ahhh" and I ain't talkin bout trey songs
Its time to leave the club an I dont see nothin wrong, yeeaahh..

THAI'S VERSE:
I pull up to the club
Valet the car
Poppin all the bottles you dont see us at the bar
Do you want the clear or would you like the brown
Do ahead and tell the waitress to bring another round
Lookin like a queen, im th king of the town
No need to waste your time dealing with these other clowns
You leaving with me so no need to run around
Im so turned up that you can't turn me doown
Heres some wristbands for your girlfriends
Pull the robes back, let the girls in
Now fill the cups up and get the drinking
You like wat you see, we can do this every weekend
Heres the room key to the pent house
Got my boys with me so bring your girls out
The nights real young, so its gona be long
So if you leave this club, I dont see nothing wrrong
