[Intro: Husalah & The Jacka]
Original tune
Believe in ourselves so we keep pushin', you know what I'm sayin'?
So, all you have to do is do itâ€¦

[Chorus]
Yo, I'm still mobbin'
Them can't stop me, no matter what they try
No matter what them do
Them can't stop me, no matter what them try
No matter what them do, do, do
I kept mobbin'
No matter what them do, do
No matter what them try, no matter what them do, (I kept mobbin')

[Verse 1]
Blap, when I was young up in the game I was so ignorant
Sellin' cocaine all night, to make a livin'
Shot him in his face, never claimed I'm innocent
So many fake niggas huntin' real niggas
Infatuated wit' this mobbin'
Pullin' up clutchin' my  eiffel trunk throbbin'
Hood niggas die early
The system designed to hurt me
So I'll keep my rifle beside me
Send ya soul past the gates of the pearly
And I pray the Most High keep my soul
Don't lose yourself in a world so cold
When you run wit' the killas
And sell cocaine wit' gorillas
All that killin' and dealin'
The false sense of fulfillment
And then reality strike, like penitentiary livin'
Or your body cremated now tell me how is it chilly
When you're raised in the ghetto
You keep your foot on the pedal
Sellin' that dope to the angels
But the he-ron from the devils
Lean to the truth, you can't blame me
I remind you so much of who you're supposed to be
I'm of royalty you lost your identity

[Chorus]
Them can't stop me, no matter what they try
No matter what them do
Them can't stop me, no matter what them try
No matter what them do, do, do
I kept mobbin'

[Verse 2]
Yo, sellin' dope in the night time
Was not on my right mind
They shot 'em in his head
Now prayer his only life line
He was a non-believer, a black body wit' white mind
Choose to love your oppressor
I'll resist and I'll fight mine
Self hatin' niggas is only killin' they own kind
He who is a sucka, only brave against his brothas
So much hatred in his heart he spiked the womb of his mother
His essence is disconnected, seekin' acceptance from the others
Everything we do, this life was ordained for me and you
You have lost your worth, now you no time for clues

[Chorus]
Them can't stop me, no matter what they try
No matter what them do
Them can't stop me, no matter what they try
No matter what them do

[Verse 3]
I used to believe that shooting people in the face
Or in the kitchen whippin' base
Was my only escape
Plus the people around my way was dying young
So I continued to buy guns
Rather blend some he-ron then go out on a date
Then some of my friends became fiends
The poverty gained steam
They walkin' around with desperation written all over they face

[Chorus]
Them can't stop me, no matter what they try
No matter what them do
Them can't stop me, no matter what them try
No matter what them do, do, do
I kept mobbing
