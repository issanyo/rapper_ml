[Verse 1:  Mistah F.A.B.]
Roll up a 'wood baby let's smoke
Ain't no need for an Uber, it's good baby, let's walk
I ain't be too good to be seen walkin' the street
Let's hit the "Cannabis Club" and get some tree
You down to hop on the bar, I can go to the city
That “Green Door” we can smoke all day for the 50
What you smokin' on? I blow exotic
Taste this “biscotti”, blow this Hypnotic
I'm from the land where they grow that stuff
Hear you askin' 'bout some juice, here pour that up
Let's talk about music, who's your favorite rapper?
She said "I'm from The Bay, Mac Dre and Jacka"
Mine's too, botha my nigs
That's crazy, here's lit

[Chorus]
Don't worry, be hyphy
Don't worry babe, be hyphy
She told me, don't worry
About a thing
Bring that [?] back
And smoke with me

[Post-Chorus:  Clyde Carson]
You got too much time to kill
We got too much live to live
So enjoy your freedom
[?] that we on
I got all you want right here
Every day or every year
So enjoy your freedom
[?] that we on

[Verse 3:  G-Eazy]
I smoke with my mom, we hit Benihana
Tapped in and out, she best friends with Mac Wanda
I bought her a house, she do what she wanna
I took care of business, gave her my first commas
Like, yeah, and I swear I did it all right
A tough adjustment, lifestyle in the spotlight
But '06 to '07, I was just a kid with a dream tryin' to get it
No worries, livin' carefree
That "Son of a Pimp" CD raised me
And now I'm on fire like kerosene
A million dollar difference now when you compare me

[Pre-Chorus: Clyde Carson]
She just want to smoke (smoke) and chill (chill, yeah)
She just want to smoke (smoke) and chill (chill, yeah)
She just want to smoke (smoke) and chill (smoke and chill)
[?]

[Chorus]
Don't worry, be hyphy
Don't worry babe, be hyphy
She told me, don't worry
About a thing
Bring that [?] back
And smoke with me
