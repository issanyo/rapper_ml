HOOK:
You can catch me in the hood everday
On top of my grind
Riding low in my black escalade
Pistol grip on my lap at all times
No love for a hater, cuz a hater never had no love for me
I get dough and im about that cash
Cuz I blast squeeze first ask questions last

DREWS VERSE:
Funny ass cats act like they want to sign me /
How is that homie when u can't even out shine me /
If u need some kicks I could get u some shoes /
If u need some brids we own that zoo /
Everything I rap is so damn true /
Why would we lie this is what we do /
Got more cake then ur home town baker/
Stay on the grind way more then a skater /
Everybody know that we got papper /
Back in the I use to sell to cracc addics/ now I sit bak they call me mr mathmaddics/
If u paying 23 then come see me /
We get it for the dub and send it to the a /
30 a cake coming stright from the bay/
Conect dnt run dry we got it all day /

GLASSES MALONE:
Niggas know G wit the function
Funk wit whoever
Faze of the dumpin
Its whatever when it comes to my lunch
And u stop me from eatin prepare for the lumps and bruises foolish
Homies go hard
This watts niggas rims cost more then there cars
Cops tryin to put my own tour behind bars
Its off time but even more if its hard
So I leave the base to the speakers
Put water in the street like the radiator leaking
Real talk if its pcp u seeking
U talkin to the champ ain't no defeatin
Boy just tell me what u need cuzz
Homeboy I got a vietnamese plug
454 its more then just rap jack
And u Ain't got to rap for u to get clapped at--

THAI'S VERSE:

Hit new york I need 500 back
