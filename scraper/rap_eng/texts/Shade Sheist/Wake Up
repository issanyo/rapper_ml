[Verse 2: Nate Dogg]

When I wake up in the morning
When I get up out of my bed
At all times I remain a hustler
At all times I be chasing my bread(Thats right)
Since this one's for my people
I'mma make sure you heard what I said
Daddy say speak loud and clearly
Daddy say aim for the head(Nate Dogg!)
I think we all to cool to lose it
I say we all stay leveled instead(Damizza!)
I say still we tame the hookers
I know we still eluding them feds
We made this one for the negroes, and for the caucasians who care
They say they treat us like we equal
I say they treat us like we just don't care

[Hook]

When I wake up in the morning
When I get up out my bed(uh, you got to get on up)

I'm gon' speak so loud and clearly
I'm gon' aim straight for yo head(bow...bow)

[Verse 4: Shade Sheist]

Yo, it don't matter where you from
Not knowing not where you been
Can't go to sleep a child expect to wake a man
Yo, life is a lesson niggas who don't study
End up failing test and blame it on me(what)
But see Sheist only gets what he claiming to be
A real quiet motherfucker with his heart in the streets
Hot in these beats, flow sell a lot in a week
So even Billboard couldn't drop my highest of peaks
I'm with the breaks so you knowin' what they saying to me
I'm impressed how many people end up hating on me
Like a disease Shade hittin' wit' a new vaccine
I leave em' comatose(hah) falling asleep(boo....crossovers)
