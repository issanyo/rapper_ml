[Verse 1]

Funny niggas and bitches, they leave some funny-ass comments
Me I'm blowing up just like a muthafuckin' comet
Seriously though all you fools need to stop it
When my album drops you muthafuckas gon' cop it
Tryna' play me dirty like your granny's old carpet
But this ain't no accident in these streets like when two cars hit
Compare me to who? Fool, better pause it
Cause if they wanna battle these bitches already lost it
Swear I got bars, swear I got bars
If these niggas want my time then I swear I'm gon' charge
If they want a sixteen, swear I'm going harder than their little-ass dicks
And I swear I'ma go longer

[Hook]

I'm Steady Staccn and you know this shit for real
Niggas caught feelings but these niggas knew the deal
I'm never stopping got it popping like pills
I'm new, I'm fresh, nah I'm factory sealed
Brand New, I'm fresh, nah I'm factory sealed
Brand New, I'm fresh, nah I'm factory sealed
I'm so fresh, nah I'm factory sealed
Keep doing what I'm doing, give a fuck of how you feel

[Verse 2]

I changed my number on you bitch niggas
So when you call all you gonna hear is nonsense
Just like I did when you was here nigga
My present is the future and I ain't into the past tense
I'm into getting cash and putting my ass inside of fast whips
To get me to it faster, couldn't do that up in your shit
I'm making moves and now it seems you catching feelings
While I'm catching dollars falling from the ceiling, Muthafucker it's on
I swear that I'm on and if these bitches wanna trip
Well then I swear that they gone
I'm new and improved I got a vet to show me moves
And now I'm all above the rim just like an alley-oop do
A big league bitch, you 'bout to see me switch
Up on these phonies like a dress rehearsal, show's at six
But a can you blame me? Fuck that, can you pay me
Cause I'm all about the dollar, anything else is maybe
