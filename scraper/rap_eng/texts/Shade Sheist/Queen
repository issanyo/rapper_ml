[Intro: Shade Sheist, Latoya Williams]
You already know who it is… Shade Sheist (Sheist.. Sheist..)
Yea Yea Yea (yea yea yea) Sovizzle (Sovizzle)

[Verse 1: Shade Sheist]
Yes.. Babygirl it's my decision to embark upon this mission
Have me parking in the garage
Using the door that's by the kitchen, I'm itchin
For your love, prolly shouldn't mention
The dimensions of the rock inside my sock is several inches
Played for a few teams and I rode a couple benches
Wrote off a couple bitches, dedicated to my Mrs.,
Swearin under oath and bout to seal it with a kiss
You ain’t never met a nigga like this

[Hook: Latoya Williams]
Like what you do to me
(Like what you do to me)
Treat me just like a queen
(Treat me just like a queen)
Yes you do, Yes you do Baby

[Bridge: Latoya Williams]
No need to tell you baby
You are the one for me
Not sure if sent from Heaven
But Adam I'm your Eve
I’ll make it easy to stay
Can't let your love get away
Cause baby you’re all that I need!

[Hook: Latoya Williams]

[Verse 2: Shade Sheist]
And I ain't tryina come off like I’m sympin
But I damn sure don’t wanna make you think your man is pimpin
For instance, the only time I'm limp is when you put it on me
Fingers to my lower tummy, prolly should've never told me
I mean you, about my spot, cause your lick is like a shot
When you do it makes me hot, better stop
Before we get engaged and I don’t mean marriage
But we bumpin just like bunnies might as well give you some karats
To inherit, my last name and all of my possessions
Girl I'll treat you like a weapon
Keep you tucked next to my chest
Then do you like a test and be the answers to your questions
Cheat up off my paper and you'll never have to guess then
Yep a smart-alec, bout to go turn in my ballot
Bout to scratch my whole arm up because you are my habit
One I don’t need to quit, I don’t need to intervent
I don’t need to slow it down all I need's another hit
Of your love

[Hook: Latoya Williams]
