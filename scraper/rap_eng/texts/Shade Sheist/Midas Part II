Chorus

Ryanito:

Oh Now they got bread they think they rich
Always in my head I knew I never needed this, everything I'd do was true proving how id beat the tricks/ if gold is what you seek yo let me help you see the shit/

When this began I was on a different trip, just an ounce of bad ego makes you sick, know  I planned on every moment for the flip, now all you see is gold shoot freely from my fingertips/

Ryanito:

Verse 1:

With the hands of king midas/
Everything we touch is gold/
Foes know they can never be like us/
Doing what is righteous/
I’m the king of this hill spitting ill/
Like b real from cypress/
Hall of fame in this game like johnathan unitas/
Pull back hallmary send you to the sky quick/
Living fast but cautious with my approach/
They say you love it let it leave but this rap shit I’m never letting go/
Strategic with my words, every syllable a blow/
Filling up your ears with that silly putty flow/
Rakim and nas jones impressionable as a little woe/
The reason when i spit you bob your head to every single note/
Walking on this water but I’m not inside a boat/
You talking like you proper but no one will supercede my quot/
On another level i put in terms you understand/
Mic in my right turn this into gold with my other hand/

Chorus

Shade Sheist:

Verse 2:

I might as well be a fucking jeweler in the diamond district/
Cause everything i touch turn to platinum and gold/
Just like my chains and for long similar to dip sticks/
I roll with the misfits/
We truly outrageous i ain't gem though/
Cause thats a bitch and i ain't that you must me them hoe/
Ill tap your face like glass joe/
And break your zirconia/
Now thats for being fake you don’t know me bruh/
But you can not like your woman do/
Oh you didn’t know we was cliqued up/
You on speed dial number two/
Number one is her father/
I’m the one she call daddy when we taking a shower/
Sliding into that gradually/
I tasted the sour/
Chalk that into a tragedy /
Now i got all the power and 50 cent gon be mad at me/
But this no sitcom bro/
I’m more like real tv if you remember that show, though/
