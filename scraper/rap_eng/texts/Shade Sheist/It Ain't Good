[Verse 1: Shade Sheist]
Ok I know it's been a long time, I shouldn't have left you
Without a funky beat to rep to
Without some real rhymes to relate to
Yeah I heard the radio, I turned it on I was stressed too
They said I had to be more conscious
Otherwise the smarter people wouldn't watch this
I remember when khakis was the outfit
Now these niggas wearing blouses and skirts up on they boxers
Everybody hard (man they so hard)
Flossin all that money up on IG but got rental cars
Can't even pay to make a decent album
But they can fake that funk and swear that people care about em
Well the golden era's over (it's over)
Now Eazy rolling in his grave and Pac's body got colder
And I ain't saying you should
But somebody gotta hit these niggas up and tell em that it ain't good

[Hook: Shade Sheist]
Cause when I turn on my radio player it ain't good
On the tv watching all this "Love & Hip Hop" shit it ain't good
I'm liable to go outta my mind, that ain't good
Nigga it ain't good

[Verse 2: Shade Sheist]
She said damn motherfucker you been gone for a minute
I said chill girl it's been a little while
I been letting niggas marinate they garbage so that I ain't gotta smell it when I come back to the steal the whole crowd
She said wow
And it's reactions like that that really let me know that I've been missed, It's like the industry's pissed
That I would even have the nerve to leave em stuck with this shit, Well now I'm back and it goes like this
First off suckas you don't run the West, you running your mouth
I mean I listened to your shit I'm only hearing the South
Homie that's weak, now get a sneak-peek
Of some real West Coast shit
And nigga don't blink, don't sink don't plummet
Don't lie and say you love it
Give these motherfuckers false hope to make more of it
You can shove it up your ass, put that shit up in the past
And on my hood I'ma die before I let another weak bitch think it's all good
