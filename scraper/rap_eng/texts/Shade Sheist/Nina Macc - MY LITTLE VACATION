Whats up you got the game fucked up
Told u hoes I'll be back, they said the Macc switched up
Switched what? I was in my dressing room fixing up
Now I'm back up at my table like I'm done fixing lunch
You mutts really thought i was completed, be seated
Everytime I fucking win all you suckas think i cheated
I'm heated, you deleted, your shit we don't need it
I'm the reason every season man we always top seeded
Go and check the rank while I go and the check the bank
When I hop up in the G Wagon I never check the tank
Bitch you better check your boat cause that muthafucker sank
In the water where it's blue like hpnotiq that i drank
What you think I was over, my rhyme's getting colder
Finer with age it's like you never even known her
I'm older I'm bolder I'm twisting up some soda
That means we in here baking just in case I never told ya
Don't bring me no complaints about some shit I never sold ya
That might be ice but I'ma show you something colder
To be up in this game you need a little bit of patience
And that's why I took my ass a little vacation

Why you hoes look mad
Yall supposed to be happy I'm back
I motivate yall
Yall hoes look like yall wanted me to stay gone forever
Ol' busta ass bitches

Dumb bitches calling dumb bitches
2 fingers spread with two middle fingers twisted
San Diego's finest new edition don't miss it
Bobby Brown skinned with the real cavi lyrics
Talk a lot of shit and yeah they act like they don't hear it
They ear I'm quite near it, greatness I know they fear it
It's been a long time since I first got down
But I still keep bringing yall this Emacc sound, now
Stupid bitches they really can't stand that
Nina Macc is similar to Tony Montana
I built a whole empire with Cookie and my hands
And these niggas Lucious lying if they tell you I ain't bad
I'm the greatest you know it if you tasted
1st rank prize every time I'm gonna place it
Ain't no need for dreaming if you never gonna chase it
I'ma be alright if I ain't never on a station
Maccmobb you know the Maccmobb
Gonna always have my back and that's the reason that I'm on
I'm thankful for the minutes that you gave me to say this
And I promise I ain't going on no other vacations
