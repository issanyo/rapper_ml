[Verse 1: Shade Sheist]
They tried to tell me it was over but these niggas lied
I came back on that ass why they act surprised
Shout out to Robin Harris..
Yeah bitch we're like bebe kids we don't die
We multiply you hear that shit
That means there's more than only one of us that's up in yo whip
When you hittin them dips and you got our shit bangin
Just know that on the other side of Earth they be hangin
And they listen to this they pumpin they fists
Up in the air like they sockin all the clouds in they lips
And bustin them shits we puffin them spliffs
You funkin with me that means you funkin with this
Now ride with a nigga coincide with a nigga
If I'm outside of the club they go inside with a nigga
That's word to Nate Dogg.. that's word to Eazy
That's word to Pac none of these niggas can see me When I'm on this funk!

[Hook: Shade Sheist]
I live for the funk I die for the funk
In fact when I pass just bury me in a trunk
And I know what I say sounds crazy
Still ain't nuthin but a g thang baby
And uh, if you don't like it then you ain't gotta call
And it's still above the law (aww)
I might be stuck in the past but yo you got no future
Cause no matter what u say muthafucker GFUNKISFOREVER

[Verse 2: Shade Sheist]
I remember Dj Quik told me in 98
That life is much too short to not be fly and not be great
So I put em together and now bitch this is bigger than The Empire State
That vampire state them suckas be in
Where they sleepin on the funk but follow all them weak trends
Niggas wearin miniskirts as some grown men
Tryna play it off as fashion real niggas don't pretend
I'll never need a gimmick just so you can see me kick it
I'll never wear a dress who you tryna impress
Homie this the West.. no.. We The Best
We wear Chuck Taylors and we never smoke stressa
And if you think I'm dissin then you clearly didn't listen
To the intro of my album in which case you would be missin
The whole damn purpose of this muthafuckin mission
Is to the bring back the funk and now that I got yo attention.. listen

[Verse 3: Shade Sheist]
Bang bang boogie da bang da bang boogie
To da boogie bang boogie da bang
Fuck what you sayin nigga this is bangin this is bangin
This is bangin.. yea.. (i'm guilty)
So you can sue me or try to prove me
Wrong with my song but you'll never overrule me
Conclude me or even outdo me
The 90's was the trailer, this the muthafuckin movie
