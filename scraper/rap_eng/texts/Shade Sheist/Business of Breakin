[Verse 1]

Stack it up high, I don't know about low
These Giuseppes, I don't know about those
Naked life, I don't know about clothes
And I walk on rose petals, I don't know about floors
Cause in my business, Baby anything goes
If you stroll through my building with a duffle full of dough
You know, you better come through with a row
And it would be nice if you pulled up in a Rolls
Damn I'm so demanding, hope you understanding
Cause I ain't got time if you don't got ends
Cause I don't need romancing, I'm into cash advances
So nigga pay me up, no I ain't got friends
Talk is cheap and you sounding real stingy
Like a small dick, doing shit for free just ain't in me
Pop them dollars off the clip just like a semi
And I'll show you exactly what I do in your city, be like ugh

[Hook]

I'm in the business of breakin' niggas
I'm in the business of breakin' it down
I'm in the business of breakin' niggas
I'm in the business of breakin' it down
I'm in the business of breakin' niggas
I'm in the business of breakin' it down
To the compound pal
You'll be broke when I come to your town
I breaks it down

[Verse 2]

Who are all these phonies on my way to getting money
I don't really wanna know just kinda think this shit is funny
Niggas switch up, bitches switch up
Man I'm a boss, yall need to get your cake up
Yall hating on a young one (yep)
Yall know yall looking dumb huh (yep)
I'm just out here having fun huh (yep)
At the same time stacking funds huh (yep yep)
Now back to the lecture at hand
That's only assuming that lecture really means bands
I'm bout to go ham
They love what I'm doing so now I guess I got fans
I guess I got jams
They moving they bodies and all my records in demand
And me I'm like damn
I was just fuckin around and now I'm breakin it down, be like bam

[Hook]
