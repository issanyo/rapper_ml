[Verse 1]

Gossip and foolishness, they talking that stupid shit
Nina still rollin through, this track here is proof of it
Now I got an album and I'm acting a fool with it
Cause they call me Hollywood anyways and I'm through with it
Call me Beverly Hills if anything
Cause you more than likely to find me there doing my thang
When I say I'm a boss it's what I mean
When you say you're a boss you spittin dreams
Ain't no maccin' the Macc and that's a fact
I got all these niggas mad and all I did was come back
Like I left something over there and needed that back
So I went and got it quick, now you can't be mad at that

[Hook]

They ain't runnin' nothing, but they mouths
Me I run them numbers to my bank account
Fronting for the world, need to cut it out
And see what a real bitch all about

I'm fresh, I'm she
Factory Sealed, that's me
I'ma do what I do
Try to stop me you a fool

[Verse 2]

Tre why they always tryna' tell me that I'm tryna' be her
When I'm in my own lane and they ain't even on my curb
I came into this game with my own shit
Paid my own way cause I was all up on my own dick
They say I'm too raw but I got tricks
Which means that I'ma be alright if I don't rap shit
I know that's unfair but I don't care
Cause the similarities gotta be more than platinum blonde hair
And they ain't runnin' nothing

[Hook]
