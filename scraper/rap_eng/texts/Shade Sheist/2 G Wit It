[Verse 1]

Ugh, I got it, the chronic, It's all eyes on me baby
Ugh, I got it, the chronic, that's why my eyes chinky
Now I was the corner of something and something street
Chillin at the spot where I know all my bitches be
Celine bag right here and that's where I keep my heat
But I don't never use it so its under the makeup sheets
We was just posted tryna find us a lick
You know what I mean, find us a trick
A sucker ass nigga tryna think with with his dick
That think he pulled him a bitch but homie don't even trip

[Hook]

Because the girls in the trap are always hard
We start talking that trash you start using your card
And then the next thing that you know is you outta yo whip
Now don't fuck with me boy this Nina pack a full clip, I'm 2 G Wit It
Yup, I'm 2 G Wit It
I'm 2 G Wit It

[Verse 2]

Like this millennium
I got bars, maybe too many of em
They mad, and that's so silly of em
I turn em all red just like I'm hemoglobin
Now picture me rollin
Flossin a Benz on rims that are never stolen
Staying at this number one spot kinda like I'm frozen
You forever number two you fools, I'm the one that's chosen
Like all this ass in these jeans I'm the one that's holdin
If you catch me in a lineup believe me I'm never foldin
I might just flatten a bitch like tires rollin
For even approaching this microphone I'm controllin
See me on my grind, see me bout to shine
See me on some real shit, I'm really doin fine
See me on no gimmicks, see me doin me
If you see Nina Macc you will see I keep it G
I swear to GOD yo these...

[Hook]
