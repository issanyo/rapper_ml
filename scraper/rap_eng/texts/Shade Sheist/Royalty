[Verse 1]

First off I wanna give a shout out to my clit
Man, who even says that shit
(You know the radio ain't gon' play this bitch)
Yeah, well they can suck a dick
I made a thousand dollars off a single in a week
Took that money broke it down and threw it on freak
I made ten grand off a trick in a hour
That's your whole quarter sitting by my shower
I don't give no fucks I don't got 'em to give
I got a couple bucks if you need some rent
That's insurance money it won't give me a damn thing
Let alone a muthafuckin' dent
I rep for the bitches who dont need a nigga
Left side of the comma always sittin' three figures
Left side of my garage is where I keep that G-Wigga
Left side of the map all that shit should read Nina

[Hook]

Yeah I'm west coast royalty
I sit on a Throne, I fuck with a L.A. King
You know that I was named after the chrome thing
And if you ever fucked with me you know you paid me
You know paid me, you know paid me
Like the first and fifteenth you know you paid me
If you fuckin' me baby you know you fuckin' royalty

[Verse 2]

Make money, spend money do another video
Another song, make a movie I don't even know
Them good problems cause anything other than the cash
Will have me flaking on that ass, yeah I won't even show
They say that I'm a fake bitch
But I'm ballin' and you frontin' like you fake rich
He said they was gon' hate this
And he was right but I told him they don't fade this
I ain't on the Gram tryna get likes
I ain't up on Twitter tryna follow up
I'm just tryna get my fuckin' paper right
And now I use this music as a double-up
I'm a cold senorita
I'll freeze your bank account, yeah I guaran-fuckin-tee ya'
You for sure gon' see a
Mexican bitch doing excellent shit, cause I'm
