Lord have mercy on my soul
Lord have mercy on my soul
Lord have mercy on my soul
Lord have mercy on my soul

Can you just miss me with that drama
It's been a while since I've been around
It's been some time since I've seen you smile
Ain't ya new man, but I'm still in style
You saying nothing been the same since
We'll never know till we let it go
To heck with clothes when we get alone

Lord have mercy on my soul
Lord have mercy on my soul
Lord have mercy on my soul
Lord have mercy on my soul

You something beautiful baby
I just wanna let you know that
I think you should let your hair down
And maybe even throw it back
So if this what's come to
An inside joke between us two
Cause after a few drinks pass

Lord have mercy on my soul
Lord have mercy on my soul
Lord have mercy on my soul
Lord have mercy on my soul


I can tell you know it, I can see its true
Despite all the games it ain't over between me and you
I swear this is thing about you
Cause I'm just tryna make round two
I can tell that you've been hurting, desert him
Girl I promise he ain't worth it or workin
I know that I ain't perfect
When you girls pick what these words spit
Get you shirtless, you deserve it I mean that
Lean back tastes sweeter than bubblegum
I need to get you alone, so in the sheets we roll

Lord have mercy on my soul
Lord have mercy on my soul
Lord have mercy on my soul
Lord have mercy on my soul
