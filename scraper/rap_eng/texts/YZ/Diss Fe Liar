[Intro]
YZ is in the house
Yo why brother you want to diss me?
Ask yourself the same question
Steppin to me is a wrong move, and you just made one
Son
For I'm am the son of the father, don't bother me
Me YZ, Crocodile Dundee

[Verse 1]
Dundee bumboclaat
YZ fi large in charge
Of the masters of the Eastside Division
I have the vision and the strength
To lead armies
But niggas start fi war
But I can surely end it
Twist and bend ya til you forfeit
I know the manner of your managers way of putting out your plastics
So please don't make me use drastic
Measures of a diss, hiss? I didn't think so
Steppin up to me is a wrong move
I can't trust a snake so I choke you to death
Put your head to rest
The devil must rest for 2000 years
The fears of men offend and bend
And step right in
Yakub was the devil tho he was the black man
The Wise is a liar and some accept the program
Damn, I can't understand
How far can one man go
To put another man down for his own flow
To fight the meek the mild, the versatile
The wildest style crocodile MC
Against the best of the east and the west, king YZ
Crocodile Dundee

[Interlude]
Aight check this out
I'm about to get real stupid now
That was low, now I'mma go high
Why lie, Wise?
Check this out

[Verse 2]
Yo YZ does not play when they say that I am a true blue one
And whenever youth comes to truth I'm on the loose
I said one time before the hate will come to cease
Nevertheleast I live in peace, and suckers live in pieces
There are no creases, strictly flat out
I'll take the ghetto hat out
But you are not ghetto, hello
Fellow black man said fi manager tried to take him
He did not try to take them, or they would have been taken
But onto the next because I don't have time for liars
The Poor Righteous Triers, teaching? please
First you must learn before you teach, true
For teachin a false fact, me say that not right, black
Me, the YZ man you know not who you step to
We, the E-S-D posse will strictly crush you
Don't try to step or else its time to say peace
For i am the first one, you know just what I speak of son
You are a student of the product that I gave you
But first you look up to
And presence you try to, take my position my spot is locked up
YZ is a prophet, some of thy posse needs to stop it
Bad, you can't last in this game called hip hop
If you [?] then you're 'bout to get shot
You're a wild child, crocodile MC
Me fi YZ, Crocodile Dundee

[Interlude]

Now don't step to the god until it's time to say peace
Understand my man?
This one will be short, the next one will be as long and strong
As a lie
