“More Than War” by YZ from the LP “Muad’Dib”

To all the fallen soldier… this one’s for you. Yeah

Verse 1
To all the old, middle age and those considered the youth
I’m here to represent you and get your neck out the noose
We lost a lot of good soldiers lately, it hurt when we do
Rest in peace to J-Dilla, Pro X and Proof
So every time I spit flames I carry a torch for you
It's strength in the name, ya’ll like our Marvin Gaye, Rick James and Sam Cooke
The blow the game took. Keep your eye on the prize
Cause tomorrow’s only death in disguise
But be strong cause you can face it remember it’s promised to all
It’s what you do while you’re living is what I consider your call
Whether you want everyone locked up or freedom for all
Your coffee come from Guatemala or you pray the Kabbalah?
You drink Star Bucks or Pray five times to Allah?
No matter the class we better change fast or this place ain’t gonna last
I hope you see r.e.s.p.e.c.t before you pass

Chorus
They got a bomb for me, they got a bomb for you
They got a bullet with my name on it, bullet for you
They put crack in inner cities just to ruin the youth
And alcohol killed more than war
(Repeat)

Verse 2
Hold it now like the Beasties, I hold it down like a beast
Say my name in any circle watch your knowledge increase
I’m Muad’Dib in the desert when your water deplete
Why go and promote hate when all I want is your peace?
Still I remain sucker free like Sundays on MTV and
Slowed my game way down so ya’ll can follow my lead
I leave my blood in every city so I’ve planted my seed
Now when it comes to harvest time my army will be divine
My soldiers put their life on the line every time
They need freedom, justice, equality that’s how we breath
Most the things we do, we do out of need and I could
Tell you War stories you won’t want to believe
Ya’ll like it digital I like it warm and round like a Neve
So when the bass hit, ya’ll screaming praise the Lord give him His
It’s our future so I pray for the kids.They planned your genocide
I promise ya’ll I want you to live

Chorus

Verse 3
Now back up I ain’t no preacher I just feel what I speak
I put my heart into the scripture and keep it far from my sleeve
Cause many men operate from a point of lust and greed
And if you can’t see that devil in their eye you’ll bleed
They came to gut the weak and they don’t give a hell what you think
Liquor Stores on every corner, suppress depression with drink
Life’s in constant motion, like the World is on axis
If God stopped that rotation what you think is gonna happen?
Life no more, that’s enough for improvement
I scream unity because the people need movement
Put your sword down, you see it’s the only solution
Anything else destruction, World pollution

Chorus
