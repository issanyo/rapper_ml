Paint her face
Eat it like some cake
Things change
She don't wanna' date
Runny nose
Think i need more cane
Morphine
Dripping through my veins

Fell in love
Now i'm a goth boy
Made some songs
Now i'm a hot boy
Things change
Fuck what people think
I might steal a Maserati with a bang

Ain't a thang'
Might rob a bank
Fm-dub
We the boys, what you think?

I know I'm good
You don't gotta' ask
Lil baby come here & shake that ass

Fuck school
Ion' fuck with rules
Fuck the females
They're all bitchy too
I ain't trippin'
Bitch gimme top
Through the city
Runnin' from an op

Like Niki
Bitch get me sticky
All drippy
Pose with a blicky
Fuck a sippy
Bitch gimme' 50
He a silly
Shoot em' with a 50

Baby girl you're a mother fuckin' angel
Baby girl look good from every angle
Get on top & I'll tell you when to stop
Baby girl ride my dick, till' she drop

I ain't trippin'
Bitch gimme' slob
I ain't trippin'
Hide it in my sock
Im the talk
Im the man of my town
And your girl told me
You a whole clown
