Tell them get out of my way
They got excuses for days
Fuck All that minium wage

Tell them get out of my way
They got excuses for days
Fuck All that minium wage


(Pusha Preme)
Look at my life, you see nothing but scars
Treat me like animals, put me in bars
My life and your life I had to evolve
From popping them mollies, my pockets would fall
No 9/11,  is fly as a planes
That ran into towers my thoughts are the same
Suicide checks and i spend em to death
Serving like butler, to live in the bank
I got no limit i master the P
Make em say uhhh everytime that i speak
Shout out my niggas especially vaughn
Drawn to success like Yosemite arms
Being a rapper has so many flaws
Hoping them hurdles im Dominque Dawes

(Hook)
Make em

Tell them get out of my way
They got excuses for days
Fuck All that minium wage
Make em

Make em Pay
Tell them get out of my way
They got excuses for days
Fuck All that minium wage

I know what that hustle is
Trap soopin that be my biz
All the work I been putting in more than to feed me git
Want them pounds like I'm getting big
See my fly like im jetting in
Bitch I need money
Goal af counting hunnids
Started from the dungeon
Nigga say you hungry
You ain't sayin nothin
I been starving longer
Nico Starving marvin

Dead on arrival cause flatline
Making em pay like it's go time
Money money be my co signer
Take ya shit like its both ours

I can tell ur love is fake like drake
If i fuck witchu then we both made
Went from Rachel ray whippin in the kitchen
To tht water whippin call me self paid
Nico made dem bitches
