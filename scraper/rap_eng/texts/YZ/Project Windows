[Verse 1: Young Roddy]
And I could show you how to mack a bitch
Show you how to bag a brick
Boy I came from rags to riches, nigga I'm a mathematician
Hell ain't too far from here, it's hard as hell to make it here
If I make it out of here then I can make it anywhere
Momma worked 2 jobs, my brother doing 7 years
Boy them crackers done him wrong
Man that made me shed a tear
Momma she didn't have no car, my granny drove a cavalier
They always told me "play my role", the strongest women that I know
Fast money, brown bag money started out broke
Then I started smoking weed, next I started slanging dope
Ring a nigga phone until it's gone, until there ain't no more
Tales of a black male, tell me something I don't know
Legal dealing, guess that's all on me like my outro
Word to Boston George I'm selling endo outdoors
Boy this Biggie Smalls if he was ever signed to Death Row
Dreamed I talked to Pac and homie told me that I'm next door

[Hook]
Staring out this project window plotting on a million
Staring out this project window plotting on a million
Staring out this project window plotting on a million
Staring out this project window plotting on a million

[Verse 2: Nesby Phips]
Phips, man what's happening?
Photo bagging and cadillac-ing
I planned, plotted, I strategized and I started stacking
Man my fall back game so strong I own a patent
You would swear I wrote a book on this here, and autographed it
Sincerely, behold a saint in Sin City
Savvy, and I know where to bank with 10 milli
Flow like Hannibal [?], this big business
And you know where I'm at if you need me, so get with me
Long gone are the days of I ain't got it
Cuz man I grow pounds in my head, it's all profit
We on and popping, this is audible narcotics
And as long as I pack it and ship it they gonna cop it
My clientel range from digital to hard copies
Word is born throw it all in the bag like armed robbery
Lay it down like shag carpet in a deluxe apartment in the sky
I try to keep my eye on the prize as I...
