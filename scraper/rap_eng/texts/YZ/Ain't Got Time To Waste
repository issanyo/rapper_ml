It's gettin' hot, thinkin' we're na-pop, my name drop
Aim gonna rock the spot, but they got
See you wit' my team chop, rap charts to pop
Whatcha sayin' ain't mine so it doesn't mean a lot
Figga, when they go buy this my pockets get bigger
Money legal, but keep my hand off the gun trigger
Stick up your eardrum, not your purse for
My bank account funds needs lots of ones
About a million of 'em, ya time went about thirty
Now the only time I guard them at y'all is when my hand's dirty
Pardon my French, but  'comment t'allez'
Rhymes vary, from here to Napa Valley
Squash grapes, make papes, make no mistakes
I hate fakes, who think I got time to waste, check it!
If you wastin' my time, don't be surprised if I rob you
If you drop dime, I'mma mob you

Time waits for no one, and everybody got to go
You think you got forever, to walk around real slow
Hesitate if you want, get called out late
It's movin' too quick, I ain't got time to waste

My man locked up state, he got seventy thousand hours
He got knocked pushing crack to the build powers
I hate to say it was the streets, cause the shit's varied
I left the yard in ya commissary
It's the only thing you got now, I wish you told me somethin'
'fore you got locked down, now I'm missin' you
And I used to cock missiles, live issues
Tree flesh and sky tissues, rip through it
If it beef, we will get to it, toss he to it
Watch it cook, and didn't care if ya look
Ski mask had the face covered, keep ya eye
On ya girl, cause I like to covet, sneak on 'er
Make her mom make you be on her, you like to cheat on 'er
Now she at the crib I like to freak on 'er
You in my face, we can speak on it
You wanna talk, or do you wanna put the HEAT on it...

Tough time make the tough rhymes
Things changed and we a long way from white lines
Back in the day it seemed strange but they over now
People try ta bring it back but they don't know you now
Whatcha think that they owe you now? It might be true
But he forgot about it, now whatcha gonna do -
Sit back or go and get that?
If you wit some gettin C.R.E.A.M. [money], then I'm wit that
If your girl is in the teams, we can split that
And if she likes Cristal, we can sip that
I'm wit the kickback, we can lay back about the weekend
Let the phone ring cause I ain't got time for speakin'
Nowadays you ?not? only got time for freakin'
And if I go limp, Viagra I'm seekin'
I work for this, got money by the fist
I remember when I could only lay back and wish...
