“Motion” by YZ of the LP “Muad’Dib

Yeah! I put it in, motion
I let you mother fuckers know
I put in motion

Verse 1
Yo! ya’ll stagnant with it, I’m a magnet with it
Hold on my flow is sidick committed, acidic
Don’t get too close it might burn you
It’s what it is, motion cause ya’ll seem to procrast
I peep through ya’ll game like glass
Soon as ya’ll mention my name I mash
Got to get to it, got to work through it
Nobody else gonna do it, I handle my biz
Cause this is the way The Y is
On that yellow brick I’m just like The Wiz
On that man shit ya’ll acting like kids
I work for myself I ain’t searching for gigs
Ya’ll fake ass dudes ya’ll remind me of wigs
Pull ya’ll off fam I show your hold card
Stone ya’ll beat you with a crow bar

Chorus
I put it in, Motion, Motion, Motion, Motion
I put it in, Motion, Motion, Motion, Motion

Verse 2
I opened doors for ya’ll
You can separate the words if you want to
I’m talking to all ya’ll
F*&^ that bulls*&^ yo I’m coming for all ya’ll
Took my respect and I’m coming for more ya’ll
You think I’m not, You think I’m hot now
I got my guns I’m ready for show down
Ya’ll bright colors and ya’ll nothing but show clowns
I’m bout my biz I do nothing but show clowns
Raise up respect mine that’s all I’m asking
The door’s open get yo ass in
Ride wit me, cry wit me
You play those other dudes but can’t deny me
You blow like small wind I’m tsunami
Your game’s baloney I’m salami
You ain’t my homey that don’t fly B
You’re paid for n&%%$ try to buy me

Chorus

Ya’ll know what this is, it’s a stick up kid
The track breath like weed smoke we write
This s^%* smoke free, we dope, he hype
The beats bang if they don’t then we fight
Back to the lab-o we callab-o
It’s like we’re scientist mad beats, mad flo
Concoction, oxygen plus the doctrine
It’s only begun and we ain’t stopping
I’m second to none you know my M.O
You bet on me then it ain’t a gamble
You bet on them then you might get shambled
Compared to mine they don’t light a candle
They can’t see this, I’m the elitist
I’m lineage they’re game’s young like fetus
Ya’ll n&^%%$ ass ya’ll butt holes and Bevis
My style’s crack it’s choke holds diseases

Chorus
