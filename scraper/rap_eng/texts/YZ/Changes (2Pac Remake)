[Intro:]
Yeah, this shit real
[?]
Free my nigga [?]

[Verse 1:]
I don't see no changes
I wake up in the morning and I ask myself
"Is life worth living should I blast myself?"
I'm tired to being poor even worse I'm black
Stomach hurt some looking for a person to snack
Don't give a fuck about a negro
Put a trigga killer nigga you are a hero
No [?] wanna see ass in a jail cell
Take out of the street and [?] walfare
First they ship the drugs and then they sell it to each other
Sell that guns and then what i watch is kill each other
I got love for my brother
Or we can never go nowhere
At least we show it one another
And that's just how it's suposed to be
[?] shit is on shitting me
Fuck out my enemies
I know G is watching over me

[Hook:]
That's just the way it is
Things can never be the same
And that's just the way it is
Things can never be the same
[?] or people change
Things can never be the same
That's just the way it is
Things can never be the same

[Verse 2:]
It's boy in the streets in own property
Because I'm young and I'm black that's why police follow me
I never did a crime my acttitude
Real facts when you knee you know it's the truth
You gotta learn how to [?] your own
Be careful what you say when you talk on the phone
Be careful who you fuck with
Don't trust shit
Nigga run up I bust this
'Cause it's long guess I'm black I gotta stay strapped
Watching on my back, can't be laid back
Take the devil out the paper
Baby they start acting right
I had a lot of long nights
And even though since ever sin
We done finally got the [?] president
I just feel black
Some things never change
I'm just trying to find another way
I get high smoke to the face
Sippin lean hope is down the pain
Never be a shame
Me and my niggas just try to stay dry when it rains
'Cause when it rains it pours
No matter how much money I get, I still want more
And these niggas ain't right, don't get caught up
Trying to live that street life, nigga

[Hook:]
That's just the way it is
Things can never be the same
And that's just the way it is
Things can never be the same
[?] or big change
Things can never be the same
That's just the way it is
Things can never be the same
