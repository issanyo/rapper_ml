“Do You” by YZ  from the LP “Muad’Dib”

It’s what it is baby. You know that
Verse 1
If you don’t know already let me tell you bout me
My policy is open and shut
Like the 7 seas once in a while it get rough
Weather the storm you got to be a diamond in the rough
Life can’t even begin to show me enough
But I take what I give I’m a man I’m a live
Push me I’m a shift remember him I did it
Stop me from eating you must be kidding, I cause harm
Emergency room, I got you admitted
I taught you this game why can’t you admit it
So here’s the percentage, 85 owe me
You were blind till I taught you to see
I brought life from the darkness
You got nerve to stand here and be heartless
You should be marching I lead like Marcus Garvey
Your funny like Steve Harvey
If you ain’t live it well then you can’t charge me
Chorus
You can let em push you over if you want to
You can make all the dough that you have to
You can front cause it really don’t matter to me
Whoa Whoa Whoa
You can take down your pants if you want to
You can sell all the soul that you have to
Do you, cause it really don’t matter to me
Whoa Whoa Whoa
Verse 2
I stayed and I fought while all ya’ll quit
That’s how it is, ain’t no more rhyme biz just lies jig
You know how to shuffle I bring muscle
I remember when it was about hustle on the grind daily
Now ya’ll rhyme rarely education is lost
Sensational floss got all ya’ll up in a toss
It’s Rap Ford Manufactures an assembly line of rhyme
This paper got you losing you mind
Am I rubbing you wrong
Tell me that I got you all wrong
I love you so I got to let you know you’re all wrong
You can ad your own name to the song
You know who to trust
You ain’t never bled but you’re tragedy struck
Got your rap game all in a rut
Now Oprah can’t keep her mouth shut about us
Instead of criticizing us realize we took nothing
And made the whole World trust
Chorus
Verse 3
Open your eyes for the first time
They’re reading a script, it’ s all by design
You censer me cause of Imus than you fell in a trap
The game only lacks balance, tip the scale back
The early 90’s flow expanded the court
Rap of all sorts you couldn’t get lost
Nowadays if I heard one then I heard them all
So when they’re ready to kill one they’re killing us all
Genocide in the genetics a coup take over
Religious men rob you blind while you pray to Jehovah
My guns stay cocked I must play soldier, why
I ain’t Biggie I ain’t ready to die
Many men lost their soul on a contract
They thought it was honor to die in combat
Do you believe
Tell a man he could fly, he could breath in the sea
Tell a man he could die and he wouldn’t believe
Chorus
