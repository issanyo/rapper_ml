Horizon by YZ of the LP “Muad’Dib”

Verse 1
I”m forever in the motion until one day I was at the water staring at the sky
The Ocean’s underneath, then I had stop, this glazed look over my eyes
What a site a whale black as night geyser  in flight. I’m thinking how small am I
The sunshine on horize a tear fell from my eyes, a presence surrounds me
Was that God? I think it is. Everything was real clear, I mean it all
Everything was sitting right here. The beginning of life, The Light, and what came from it. If you study then you know this was the summit
My name’s the question the answer all together one
It’s represents the stars, moon and the sun, beginning the end and a new beginning again
The start, middle till the time is done

Chorus
When you can see the new horizon that means yes it’ll be alright
Look unto the new horizon you’ll see
Please listen to me ya’ll?
(Repeat)

Verse 2
The Sand People Liberator. I was sent for specifics the mission was major
It came from the Maker, The Owner, The Cream, The Son of Man
Walked through hallways with crack fiends numb from morphine
Beaten, wonders who’s life your cheating. It was eatin’ me all up inside
Put it away and try to hide those emotional hi-lows but that’s life
You know how the ride goes. Sell high but first you better buy low
You can not settle for the high post. The game changes, know your position
When the tide goes high you better move with the wind
Know your mission. The door’s open so come on in and close the door
The air’s warm it’s the next from the norm be wise cause a mans words can stink like manure

Chorus
