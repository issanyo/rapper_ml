“You Know Me” BY YZ feat D. Rose

Turn that music up a lil’ bit

Verse 1

I’m a leave permanent scar, look through your facade. I get you hated by your neighbors backing out your garage
Those beats band sickening, leave your face wrinkling, lean you sideways
My style is glass-dick and you got black lips
For me you rap fiend, I serve you, supply your habits
My words is just like magic
I got you rabid foaming out your mouth, teeth gritting
I do you right. I give you extra street slang spitting
For all my verbiage you feed suck me dry
A vampire connected to my rap bloodline
It’s mainline repping for the front line
My rap’s a criminal, a infamous villain escaped from Cameroon
It’s sand dune, a verbal man tomb
My rap’s groomed like Jumu’ah
You can’t defuse the god no matter who you are
Respect mine or find your limbs in emergency
Play dumb or jar your memory
You know me

Chorus
D. Rose
(Repeat twice)
Spit the flames and let’s split the game
Rip set get some change what set you claim
Take it in vain we licking shots at your membrane
Kick slang make it stain we off the chain now

Verse 2

When I entered the game something occurred, expansion moves
My heat felt all over this Earth, date back to my birth
I payed dues wasn’t shit new but me
Nowadays I renew subtly and avoid the cluttery
I break ground my flows commonly used
I’m sick of clone rapping n*&^%$ always giving me blues
Somebody please play the violin so I can get back to flows sick & violent
So ya’ll don’t have to cry again
Todays story catastrophic like the year two zero one two
Do the math if you want too
Ignorance, bliss to some of those who wish upon stars
Closed eyes in the daylight become dark
I’m here to spark ya’ll, I’m looking for the mark ya’ll
And when I spot the beast I’m aiming for the heart ya’ll
How can a man be so cocky and care about his own
Don’t mind me I be off in a zone
You know me

Chorus

Verse 3
I’m made ya’ll n*&^%$  barely getting by
Ya’ll rap like your cholesterol’s high
Ya’ll clogged up just like constipation
Ya’ll stillbirth your rhyme had a complication
Learn from my experience ya’ll too serious
And life is too short that don’t mean smoke a Newport
So here’s a new thought for you
If you got a child that adore you go home and leave me alone
Cause they’re your children but me, I’m full grown
Your game’s torn but me, I got the game sewn
Your actions are highly questionable
Why would you put your head on a chopping block
When you know how I rock
You study my moves and calculate my averages
I barely lose and if I do I get it back again
I get to it, I move swiftly, your move’s iffy
Back home they call me Tony
You know me
