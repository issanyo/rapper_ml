[Skit: John Tunstall]
Well, excuse me, Billy, very sorry to offend you... but we congregated here to learn to read and write. You need more than skill with a firearm to succeed in the new world, Billy. So take up the journal and start where the other boy left off, or you can go straight back to your home on the streets

[Intro]
Yuh, ayy
Billy Boy, yuh
Whoa, ayy
Yuh, ayy, uh, ayy

[Chorus]
Billy boy, big boy, want war (You want war)
Niggas hidin', "Knock, knock," through the door (Through the door)
Shootin’ out the window, bitch, on the floor (On the floor)
Bitches comin' from the back of the store (Of the store)
Silly bitch, silly slut, silly whore (Silly whore)
I'm runnin’ outta bullets, bitch, I got four (I got four)
I'm runnin' outta bullets, bitch, I need more (I need more)
Keep a big thing on my fuckin' waist (On my waist)

[Verse]
Bitches talkin' shit, shots to her face (To her face)
Billy Boy want more, destroy (Destroy)
Any nigga in his mothafuckin' way (Out my way)
Bitch boy, pussy boy want smoke (He want smoke)
She feelin' high, you feelin' down, snort coke (Snort coke)
I’m pullin’ in a Ford, now I'm in a Jeep (I brought the Jeep)
I got steez, I got the boom, I’m 'bout to sweep (I'm 'bout to sweep)
I’m 'bout to kill these pussy niggas, rest in peace (Rest in peace)
Y'all niggas [?], you'll break, you're fuckin' weak (Pussy)
I'll fight y'all niggas, y'all niggas go to sleep (Go to sleep)
I'll kill you niggas, make sure you don't breathe (Don't breathe)
I'll kill you niggas, make sure you don't breathe (Don't breathe)

[Interlude]
Ayy, ayy
Billy Boy, Billy Boy
Billy Boy, Billy Boy
Whoa, ayy, uh, ayy

[Chorus]
Billy Boy, big boy, want war (You want war)
Niggas hidin', "Knock, knock," through the door (Through the door)
Shootin' out the window, bitch, on the floor (On the floor)
Bitches comin' from the back of the store (Of the store)
Silly bitch, silly slut, silly whore (Silly whore)
I'm runnin' outta bullets, bitch, I got four (I got four)
I'm runnin' outta bullets, bitch, I need more (I need more)
Keep a big thing on my fuckin' waist (On my waist)

Ayy, hey, hey
Billy Boy, Billy Boy
