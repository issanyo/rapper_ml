[Intro: Mandark]
Yes, yes! With this all-powering neuratomic proto-core in my posession, I will make the world mine! Ha-ha-ha! Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha! Ha-ha-ha!

[Verse 1]
I got a plan, some sort of strategy
Catch Dex and stretch his anatomy
MD in a Lex and now you mad at me
Call me the bad guy, somebody gotta be
It wouldn't be like Nas if I ruled the world
I want power over all the little boys and girls
And all the men and women, I wanna rock linen
I want a lake-sized pool that Mandark can swim in
Lots of girls filin' down my nails
Dex, sorry, dumb and locked up in jail
Dee Dee'll be my wife and rock ice, jewels
If you a polar bear, dog, I'll send you straight to blazes

[Hook]
Mandark, Mandark is thinkin' of a master plan, Mandark, Mandark
Mandark, Mandark is thinkin' of a master plan, Mandark, Mandark (Doin' everything you wish, I'm the better scientist)
Mandark, Mandark is thinkin' of a master plan, Mandark, Mandark
Mandark, Mandark is thinkin' of a master plan, Mandark, Mandark (Doin' everything you wish, I'm the better scientist)

[Verse 2]
I can read your thoughts, beam my body across
Light waves, teleport, south pole to the north
Way cooler than Dexter, and plus I stay trippin'
Go anywhere without my parents' permission
I know you hear me 'cause I got the transmission
Soon I'll have it all, even Dexter's submission
This is Mandark, so you better pay attention
Searchin' for thoughts, I think it's time to go fishin' (ha-ha-ha! ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!)
You out there! I know you're listenin'
Is anybody home? Is your grey matter functionin'?
I'll make your brain thirst for a brand new verse
It'll make you sound smart, won't sound like a jerk

[Hook]
Mandark, Mandark is thinkin' of a master plan, Mandark, Mandark
Mandark, Mandark is thinkin' of a master plan, Mandark, Mandark (Doin' everything you wish, I'm the better scientist)
Mandark, Mandark is thinkin' of a master plan, Mandark, Mandark
Mandark, Mandark is thinkin' of a master plan, Mandark, Mandark (Doin' everything you wish, I'm the better scientist)

[Verse 3]
My brain has the capacity to fluctuate
Similar, the nerves got you shakin' harder than waves
Telepathically, I could make the world my slave
My IQ out your range, shine brighter than day
Mandark is way past the radar
Operate with lasers, invented quasars, harder than chazar
The science superstar with thoughts deeper than Mars
In the jaccuzi all day long while you're singin' my song
I know that line made you pause like a stop sign, you can't see me
In love with Dee Dee, still a little sneaky
Any minute the world will be mine, you can believe me
As for Dee Dee, she's gonna be mine
Questions are declined

[Hook]
Mandark, Mandark is thinkin' of a master plan, Mandark, Mandark
Mandark, Mandark is thinkin' of a master plan, Mandark, Mandark (Doin' everything you wish, I'm the better scientist)
Mandark, Mandark is thinkin' of a master plan, Mandark, Mandark
Mandark, Mandark is thinkin' of a master plan, Mandark, Mandark (Doin' everything you wish, I'm the better scientist)

[Outro]
Mandark!
