“Alwayz will be” by YZ from the LP “Muad’Dib”
Chorus
It’s what it is, it what it always will be  It’s what it always will be
It’s what it is, it what it always will be  It’s what it always will be
It’s what it is, it what it always will be  It’s what it always will be
I’m here in heart and mind still after all this time
It’s what it is, it what it always will be  It’s what it always will be
I’m here in heart and mind still after all this time

Verse !
Born for greatness my mothers eyes revealed a secret
To talk about it is taboo, she made sure never to speak it
My birthplace New Jerusalem mirror to Bethlehem home of my resurrection
A sheltered child hidden well beneath the soil
Amongst the working class by design never to spoil
My head anointed with oil, my sins cleansed in the water
Set up for a miracle slaughter
To die right amongst men and then live among you again
I broke with bread the hungry were fed the word was said
But of course it was written, hell has finally surfaced on Earth
I walked through fire with purpose
All my soldiers seen death don’t you even get nervous
Through Him all here for service, to praise prostrate to One Perfect
Where all life stem, death is a part of
So all one God, man, woman, child the end

Chorus

Why waste sixteen bars on remedial words
When you can come and get blessed like I respect your worth
Through your flesh all your lessons are learned
What you take from that experience is your concern
The memories all written in life
I pray you have a good read cause you won’t read twice
There’s only one breath and when it leaves you don’t breath twice
I paint through images with seed, soil, water, sun
And I love it all from conception till when it falls
From birth till when it’s done
I reach to every heart cause we are one apart
One ear, I speak in every tongue
One life, one love, one vision, One God for submission
One voice to transmit what’s your position?
You’ve got a choice
No time for petty games cause right now I’m on a mission

Chorus

Verse 3
My conclusion is this, the subject is this
It’s actual, composed of facts that’s it, that’s that
The books closed it’s flat like the simian
It’s Snoop Dog new millennium
Real as the streets will ever be, coming as rough as sea
As you breath heavily my scripture is Heavenly
A break bread you ate the Simnel it nourished you
Exposed your head. All my moves gracious
I liberate the weak, I need them strong
The war is on, to each his own
The magistrate, I was chosen for law exposed the books
The people came and they saw, then they conquered
The word evident, no more negligence
Power takes precedence, the church prebend
The money was spent on clergyman living in sin
I’m clocking you I’m in the shade watching you
Chorus
