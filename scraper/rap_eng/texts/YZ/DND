[HOOK]

In the dungeon
Bitch I’m workin
Bitch it's day to day
Y’all been fiending
Steady lurking
Nigga where’s the tape?
I been up
Workin hard
Since Tuesday
In the lab
Which album Ima drop
Two on the way
(Aye)

[VERSE]

Back to the problems
Shawty keep askin' like
Why all these models keep callin'
They know that I’m ballin
They use me for money
Good times
Then run back to they niggas
Pull up in impala
My niggas we deep
So please tell me is there a problem
Oh now yo ass silent
We got two two threes
Palehorse be the product
I got it
I should call out some names
So they know I don’t play
Dom sharpe you in the way
Retro Gang shoot the fade
Lil one and lil two
Really bitches
Who are you
No fucks on the beat
Cuz I’m really wit the tools
New niggas keep actin for clout
Old niggas is out here
Just trying shit out
You niggas and hoes
Best believe you should
Cut this shit out
Fore' I put this fashion shit down
And put down the crown
Then turn this shit all way around
Just so I can hunt yo ass down
You know I’m around
Run every lil city and town
As soon as my toes touch the ground
(Aye)
(Woah)
(Aye)
Bitch I’m Barney’s shopping
I fuck ya bitch and she keep callin'
She a dickaholic
Wait
Bring it back
(aye)
Fuck on yo bitch
Run up a check
And I hit a few licks
Off the shits
You like what is this?
Keep preme on my shirt
And my draws
Plus the rick be the kick
You lookin for work
It jumped out the pot
But I left all the bags for my bitch
You swung and you missed
Only trophy you get
Is the one for the boys on the bench

Bitch
