“Hello” by YZ from the LP “Muad’Dib”

Yo this is the S*&^, when you hear it I hope you know there’s better things to come

Verse 1

Walk in the gate there’s a dog in the yard with a stump leg
And a mean scar
Hello
Coming up the stairs there’s a man with a beard
And a tattoo shaped like a tear
Hello
Give the man a pound cause I’ve known him for years
But I still can’t tell you who he is
Hello
Walking to the door there’s a smell in the air
And whole lot of people on the floor
Hello
Stepping over this one and that one
Can’t look them in the eye I got business in the back
Hello
In the back there’s a triple beam, digital, AK-47 nervous and I miserable
Never mind that, the temperature is critical
My eye on everything got me thinking like a sentinel
Know I shouldn’t be here but I need it like it’s mineral
People spazzin’ into other planets I ain’t kidding you
Never mind I got people to see
I almost tripped over this lady, can you excuse me
Look in her face, Oh snap my mother
Look again, damn I would have sworn it was her
Hello
I can’t explain in this ladies face my mothers eyes
She grabbed my hand and began to cry I realized
I can’t continue this lifestyle it’s got to stop
Right here right now to my my knees I dropped
I asked God to forgive me now for all of my sins
Wash me clean I’ll never do it again
Little did I know my day’s already numbered by a hunter
Waiting for me to exit to put me in a slumber
Got to the door and something hit me in the middle
I went deaf so I couldn’t hear the bullets riddle
At my last breath all I remember “Whom shall I fear”
On my back staring at this tattooed tear
Hello

Chorus
I hear it everywhere the kids even saying it
It’s like the new slang but old like bang bang
Hello
It ain’t a greeting no more it’s recognition
Got those warriors in the street they’re playing they’re position
Hello
Even them girls caught on it’s like fashion
But now it’s hear to stay cause it’s no longer a game
Hello
I brought it back now it’s never the same
When you say it mean that just remember my name
Hello

Verse 2

Woke up in the hospital mama by my side
Praying for my life to continue
Hello
I.C.U. I can hear machines beeping got to close my eyes
Even though I don’t want to be sleeping
Hello
I can feel her hands I can hear her cry
Please God if you can hear me please don’t let my baby die
Hello
I dose off thinking back to my past all the people that I hurt
Even might have killed coming back
It’s all vivid I won’t live it again
If I make it to tomorrow then I promise you I’m gonna win
To many options way to many advances
Just to throw my life away taking dangerous chances
Hello
I remember jail time and drug deals going wrong
Where n&^%$ put a gun to my spine
Hello
And getting kidnapped out of my crib
Don’t ask me to explain it’s just good to be hear
Hello
Another day another breath
Another chance to see my son & daughter coming into success
Hello
Another chance to get it off my chest
Hello
A big bird cause I’m building a nest
Hello

Chorus
