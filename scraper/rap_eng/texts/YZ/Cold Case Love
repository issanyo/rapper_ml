[Verse 1]
On my roof
Dark and I'm burning a rose
I don't need proof
I'm torn apart and you know
What you did to me was a crime
Cold case love
And I let you reach me one more time
But that's enough

[Bridge]
Your love was breaking the law
But I needed a witness
So wake me up when it's over
It don't make any difference
Will it ever be solved
Or am I taking the fall?
Truth was there all along
Tell me, how did we miss it?

[Hook]
We opened up a cold case love
And it got the best of us
And now prints, pictures and white outlines
Are all that's left at the scene of a crime
Of a cold case love

[Verse 2:]
Should've investigated
But love blinded eyes
Couldn't see (no)
And then I tried to cage it
But your love ain't the kind you can keep
Release me now 'cause I did my time
Of this cold case love
My heart's no longer cold and confined
I've had enough

[Bridge]
Your love was breaking the law
But I needed a witness
So wake me up when it's over
It don't make any difference
Will it ever be solved
Or am I taking the fall?
Truth was there all along
Tell me, how did we miss it?

[Hook]
We opened up a cold case love
And it got the best of us
And now prints, pictures and white outlines
Are all that's left at the scene of a crime
Of a cold case love

[Bridge]
We lost our way
Took this too far
Now I'll never find the pieces of my heart
We've lost enough
Looking for a truth
That was here all along

[Hook:]
We opened up a cold case love
And it got the best of us
And now prints, pictures and white outlines
Are all that's left at the scene of a crime
Of a cold case love
We opened up a cold case love
And it got the best of us
And now prints, pictures and white outlines
Are all that's left at the scene of a crime
Of a cold case love
Love
