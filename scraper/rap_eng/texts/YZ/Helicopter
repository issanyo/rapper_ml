Yeah, yeah, yeah the chopper
Yeah, helicopter(vroom)
Yeah, yeah, yeah,yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, Yeah that chopper
Yeah, helicopter

[Hook]
Helicopter, my niggas got the chopper
Bitch I'm the [?]
But I got to keep a llama
But I know we 'bout to blow like Al Qaeda
And I keep the k on me like Osama
This shit get deep
And look to me like the godfather
So do not speak
Or keep the peace
And you shall prosper
That pussy squeak like Mr. Clean
It drip like water
And if you come around the flame
Get hot like Sana
Helicopter, Hopping out the roof
With the chopper(Do do doooo)
I might [?] shoot with the chopper(Do do doooo)
Helicopter, where that thing around your head helicopter
Disrespect will leave you dead and in a chopper
Helicopter, helicopter

[Verse 1]
Flame
All of my niggas got choppers
And all of my niggas they tote
If you really want the problems
Tell me which nigga want smoke(yeah)
I just fucked her in the uber
I just called the up shooter
We rollin' that, just  long as rulers
Your diamonds cool, mine is cooler
I give respect from my jeweler
And I get respect from the OG
[?] bitches they so lonely
Get a tissue, then just blow me
Fuck her, then leave her lonely
Cause in the past they didn't want me
Now that I'm Flame
They know the name
I keep a k
For some loose change
I just bust down
On Johnny Dang
You at the mall, to get some change
That shit is strange
That shit is strange to the gang
You cannot hang with the gang
You the type to change for the fame
Wow, yeah That shit is strange to the gang
You cannot hang with the gang
You the type to change for the fame
You the type to change for the fame
