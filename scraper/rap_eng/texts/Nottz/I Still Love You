[Verse 1: Nottz]

I met this girl when I was about ten
I used to love her but we still friends
Her name was Roxanne, Shantae to be exact
Girl flyer than the UTFO
I seen her at the play park
Her and her homegirls rockin they bamboos
And ad-di-das suits
Plus they had shell-toes and they Gazelles too
Wish I was grow'd up and they aged too
I wish I could afford them thangs that the older dudes wore
Then maybe she would notice me
Cold Chillin' on the Sugar Hill along with my gang

[Hook: Mayer Hawthorne]

Ooh, when I first laid eyes on you girl
I knew I had to make you mine
And even though its been so long girl
You know that you stay on my mind
So come along and take my hand girl
And we can stand the test of time
I still love you
I still love you-u-u

[Verse 2: Nottz]

You know what
For five years I was staked out in front of her crib
Just to prove to Roxanne that my love was real
But it seemed every time I  would often feel
To a woman of her caliber
I won't appeal
To? Maybe
Please Roxanne, Baby, won't you be my baby
And stop avoiding me like I'm some mutt with rabies
Some say she fuck with Dr. Ice, The Educated Rapper, and The Kangol Kid
Then reality started to kick in
I was just a kid and that began to sink in, sink in, sink in
I still have room to grow to show the world how much love I got for you fo sho'

[Hook: Mayer Hawthorne]

Ooh, when I first laid eyes on you girl
I knew I had to make you mine
And even though its been so long girl
You know that you stay on my mind
So come along and take my hand girl
And we can stand the test of time
I still love you
I still love you-u-u
