[Intro: Phonte]
Let's take it back. (Ohhh!)
Yes! (Ba pa-da, ba pa-da)
It's going to be a beautiful day
(Ba pa-da, ba pa-da)
And it's such a beautiful night
(Ba pa-da, ba pa-da)
It's so luxurious, so extravagant
(Ba pa-da, ba pa-da)
So remarkable

[Verse 1: Mickey Factz]
You're a piano score from Beethoven
A symphony when your face glowing (ahh)
Epiphanies from the chase moment
Music to my ears I can bank on it
I saw something had to wait for it (yeah..)
It's safe to say that it takes time
I see the curves on your waist line (ahh)
It remind me of the bass line
Cause it bump and it's banging at the same time
Feel like a Marvin Gaye line, mercy mercy me!
I mighta heard it through the grape vine (woo)
You're a great find
Every BB King need a Queen Latifah
That's royalty
See it's sweeter then all of the things we think is deeper (c'mon)
Soft melodies float through the sky like a fly ghost
Hearing her voice now that's a high note (ha)
At the Winehouse with my life coach (yeah)
Love is drugs and my wife dope, like whoa (woo!)

[Hook: Phonte]
You know that I'm gonna treat you right
(One time)
Going to treat you right!
You know that I'm gonna treat you right
(So right)
Know that I'm gonna treat you right
I said I'm gonna, I'm gonna treat you right
You know that I'mma treat you right
(Treat you right)

[Verse 2: Phonte]
Yo
Early morning my coffee is on
I took a sip closed my eyes
And invited the dawn
Took a trip through memory lane
As you laid on my arms
Thinking back at all my niggas that I should have warned
Now I see that they full of resentment
Instead of contentment
Looking at their baby mamas
Like I should have worn a condom
Or took it to the crib
And beat off to some porn
The drama got them wanting to run
But that option is gone (freeze nigga)
I say all that to say we're fortunate
We don't treat our love as a tournament
A contest or a game that you just play
Until you go on and get bored with it
And where the next contestant is some kind of ornament
Goings is rough,  the smooth seas never made a sailer
And lawsuits never made a tailor (ho!)
Pun intended
Another inventive way to say I love you in health, And in sickness, infinite, I'm out (woo!)

[Hook: Phonte]
You know that I'm gonna treat you right
(Ride it out)
Going to treat you Right!
You know that I'm gonna treat you right
(So right)
Know that I'm gonna treat you right
I said I'm gonna. I'm gonna treat you right
You know that I'm gonna treat you right
(Treat you right)

[Verse 3: Mickey Factz]
Hold up!
Wait a minute I ain't done yet (ahh)
You remind of a picnic with a sunset (ahh)
I be staring at you in your sundress (yeah)
I'm looking at you right now like wow
Phonte I'mma treat her right, bro
One on one this is a iso
For my whole life, yo
Music to her ears I'm a maestro
Love is drugs and my wife dope, like whoa!

[Hook: Phonte]
You know that I'm gonna treat you right
(One time)
Going to treat you Right!
You know that I'm gonna treat you right
(So right)
Know that I'm gonna treat you right
I said I'm gonna. I'm gonna treat you right
You know that I'm gonna treat you right
(Treat you right)
