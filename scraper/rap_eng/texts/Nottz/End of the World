[Hook: Rashad]
One day you will return
Baby, don't cry
Love over fear, the stars have aligned
The end of a time

[Verse 1: Blu]
The highest realm, she never saw yellow submarines
And human beings from outer space, out of space, out of mind
Dotted line grinds, got 'em signing up for Columbine
Columbian white lines, ring around the rosie's, pocket full of homies
Only one god, sat up above all with the mastermind
Yo, she dreamt like digital data, autobiographic pixelated magic
Blowing kisses at her
From the last moon woke up to the gold sun
Put a gun in one hand, told him have a sweet life
One day we gonna live it like them summers that we never left
Pictures that we never took of bitches off that top shelf
Help me to the promised land, I promise you can have it
You can bag it like cotton for slaves, water for chocolates
Pilot my pivot, piss in a bucket
Kick our feet up as our children grow up nothing like us

[Hook: Rashad]
One day, you will return
Baby, don't cry
Love over fear, the stars have aligned
We are the secrets they kept all of this time
And i don't give a damn if this the end
They won't sin in the end

[Verse 2: Blu]
If this is love, fuck it, I could be a god
If I'm a god watch me pull a heaven out a star
360 billion trillions miles away from home
I heard a heartbeat and decided I should make a song
Momma read a song tell my father I'mma see him where that grass gets
Greener than Seattle after storms, about to read my last poem
Hope you forget it, I told her that it's only one way
I took a million steps, must have read a million scripts
'Fore I picked the perfect role, churches, corporations
Slave wages, pretty hoes...
Whoever told the police he could take my life?
Take my brother's life! Fuck it, take my mother's life!
Take my land, take my manhood, my fucking rights! (Biiach!)
Then enforce the laws
Pray to God one day we gonna be free like the children in the king's dream
I remember being free on King street

[Hook: Rashad]
One day we'll be free like forever
Heart of Gandhi, side of Mandela, yeah
I See you on the other side, not only in my dreams
I See that it's the end of time
Someone, somewhere, every day
I see ?

[Verse 3: Blu]
Somebody's fag, pulled the dick out they ass and I shot the fucker
I could never stop to love her when shots flutter
Cock suckers with pretty wives and gay children
Wear badges and cry, At beauty pageants my sister won a prize
I was in the prison hiding presents from the guards
And local racism, 8 minutes and this whole world is finna end
I watch the fringe film 'the fin', infant again
She says she got to see where infinite ends and it was beautiful
I said I know I make the music

[Hook: Rashad]
You will return
Baby, don't cry
Love over fear, the stars have aligned
We are the secrets they kept all of this time
?, if this the end
They won't sin in the end
