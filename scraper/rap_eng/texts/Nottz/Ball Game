[Verse One] [Big Shot Manceeni]:
Yo, you the type to get locked up, turn vegetarian
Now you toss salad, my environment is violent
And your past ain't even violent
A squad full of real niggas, screamin' "We the best"
Look, we on that DJ Khalid
Let y'all rappers sing the ballads
Lightin' up scented candles, drum kick you out your sandals
Tryin' to be the man will only get you man handled
We a squad full of lions, hope your first name is Daniel
Put your head upon the mantle

[Cutlass Reid]:
I paint a masterpiece, with colors so vivid
You in the presence of greatness, that makes you a witness
Me and my niggas for real homie, you got to live it
You can't pick up the ball nigga, and drag your pivot
Kobe Bryant from the starter scrimmage
Hungry than a motherfucker like Chauncy in Menace
It comes from a Hiiigher Power, word to Lamar, Kendrick
When I recite, it feels like doin' God's business

[Khizman]:
Listen, had my ears to streets son I heard 'em say
Durte Muzik back like a vertebrae
Hangin' with the sinners on a Saturday
Then I chill with the Saints on a Latter Day
Aye
We in a different categor
Tired of the bull like a matador
Who said that Kai ain't the shit?
He talkin' blasphemy
Hit the booth, get away with murder like Casey Anthony nigga

[Scratch Chorus]:
"This is" - M.O.P
"Hear about it from the bottom of Hell"
"Say yeah"
"Hear about it from the bottom of Hell"

[Verse Two] [Ivory Keyes]:
The fuck is these niggas talkin' 'bout?
I get money, see the fiends outside of my house
I got the .45 planted under your bitch blouse
So when I'm down and out I'm runnin' up in your house nigga
Be easy
I keep the guns greasy, I'm sleazy
Only the money can please me like Jeezy
I sell cocaine
Any goddamn thang
I'm like a rottweiler off of the chain
Come and get a bite mayne

[Boogie]:
Like you niggas ain't know so
You fuckin' with some pro's yo
Show you who's the one son, like Diggy did JoJo
Middle finger to low low
Cause I ain't never gave a fuck
Cause after this they gon' hop right back on my dick nigga, pogo
Half these niggas is homos
The other half is fake
So I stuck with the recipe, stacked my doe and made my cake
It's Boogie
Matter of fact, it's Boogie the great
From the incredible D.M.P., motherfucker it's worth the wait
I'm gone

[Nottz]:
Motherfucker we back
Time to shut up the track
D.M.P.'s the name
Wolf Gang with the fame
And we out for the blood
Nigga hungry for your hate so nigga fuck your love
Give these nuts a hug
Motherfucker we back
Give you no time to react
God didn't prepare you for this kind of attack
And we ain't stoppin' till y'all droppin' all gone
D.M.P. yeah we back in the buildin'
Fucker we on!

[Starboy]:
Boy
Picture that, dirty boys back dumbin' out
That's a wrap, God bless and thank you for comin' out
V.A., give it to the DJ
Set off a heatwave
These niggas is cliche
You frontin' with he say?
Bluffin' like he paid?
We livin' that G way
Stuntin' the least when the heat spray
You ask me then they all lame
Boy we back
Lay down and man up homie it's ball game
