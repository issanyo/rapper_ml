[Verse 1: Mickey Factz]
I'm a slave owner with a chain on him
Masterpiece till my days' over
No limit to the great flower
It ain't Master P, it's a tank roller
Minus the peace, I'm a paint thrower
Who want' a piece of me?
Opposite of evil, get the peace from me, peacefully
Out in AZ, get the pieces of a man divided equally
I went Bonita out in Phoenix at an eatery
Checking out the scenery
Peace sign, shout to Evil Dee
Give me five feet or my man'll buck shots at you easily
With the piece, I'm a peacemaker
Peaceful, 'cause the piece is full
I'm on my P's and Q's
Without deans and school
Need the juice
Like Bishop when he went and put the piece to Q
All City Chess piece, tell your queen to move
I check mates on the scene with Blu
Fuck!

[Chorus: Mickey Factz]
Left hand in the sky, we the best
Put one finger real high if you blessed
Then the other finger, that's right to the left
Now move your hand from the right to your left
My flow hard to mimic like Yiddish
Still one of the best spitters, admit it
Ain't a nigga touchin' mines when you listen to my shit
You don't chew, you don't breathe
You don't miss a fuckin' line

[Verse 2: Blu]
A piece of what everybody want' a piece of
Two G's peace up on the piece once
And everybody want peace till they rest in peace
You see their piece of life eaten like pizza
But I guess you don't mind what a peace of mind
That's why I try to keep a piece of mine
So every time I write a rhyme I keep peace in mind
Like why ride with the piece if I'm riding in peace?
I eat a piece of pie, I use a peace pipe to free my mind
I keep the piece like [?]
Peas in a pot, but I don't eat the peas to pass the [?]
Murder beats, like they used to say
Pass a fist like a peace activist
After this add Mickey Factz to the Most Classic list
Masterpiece

[Chorus: Mickey Factz]
Left hand in the sky, we the best
Put one finger real high if you blessed
Then the other finger, that's right to the left
Now move your hand from the right to your left
My flow hard to mimic like Yiddish
Still one of the best spitters, admit it
Ain't a nigga touchin' mines when you listen to my shit
You don't chew, you don't breathe
You don't miss a fuckin' line

[Verse 3: Mickey Factz]
Here go' my peace offering
I've got the seats pouring in
Streets marketing, radio, peeps calling in
Keep honoring, crazy flow, keep orbiting
Outer space, he's Morpheus
Red or blue pill, need more of it, we' storing it
Media out, reporting it
I'm from the future, DeLorean, cheap ornament
'Cause I'm still on the top, Victorian
Landscape, handshake secret, Victoria
Man, wait, y'all are the weakest, some Victorias
Stand straight, praise the most high, he's glorious
Hand in the air, I'm coming with peace, officer
But I'm black, so I yell back "Peace, officers!"
No, I don't got me a gat, or piece, officer
I'm in a manger, waiting for a peace offering
I'm a master, peace

[Chorus: Mickey Factz]
Left hand in the sky, we the best
Put one finger real high if you blessed
Then the other finger, that's right to the left
Now move your hand from the right to your left
My flow hard to mimic like Yiddish
Still one of the best spitters, admit it
Ain't a nigga touchin' mines when you listen to my shit
You don't chew, you don't breathe
You don't miss a fuckin' line
This is the difference between MC-ing and rap
