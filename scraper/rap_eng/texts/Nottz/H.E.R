Chorus:
What love got to do with it?
What’s love go to with it?
You know what love is

Verse 1:
I met her through my brother
At the record store, I dug her
Remember getting her number
Suggested that I should buzz her

Back then I was just a youngin
But we connected on the phone like we were lovers
Trying to get up in the covers

Had her by my, side in the  ride in the back of the bus together
My mama didn’t like when we hang out too much together

A school crush, but better, it was true love, we never
Going to lose touch, forever yo we grew up together, and
Doing the doo wop, shadibidy boo bop
On a roof top, with you on
My boom box, watching the moon drop

Used to save for her
Just so I could pay for her
Put her on
Dedicate everyday for her

Huh, what’s the definition of love huh?
It’s a word we’ve been given to sum up
A feeling that we feeling for someone
Or something, the one I’m in love with


Chorus:
What love got to do with it?
What’s love go to with it?
You know what love is


Verse 2:
What I loved most, she had so much soul
And a huge bottom end, the fly'est female

Started comprehend, the finer details
Something that Common said, felt the same way he felt

Always off and on again, but I thought
That it was never going to end, I was wrong

Even though, we were close, we started to lose the spark
I needed room for me to grow, that’s why we grew apart

Huh, what’s the definition of love huh?
It’s a word we’ve been given to sum up
A feeling that we feeling for someone
Or something, the one I was in love with

Chorus:
What love got to do with it?
What’s love go to with it?
You know what love is

Verse 3:
I wish we could take it back to the start
Refresh, rewind, you left a gap in my heart
Each breath, breath life, time patch up the scars/
But now, we light-years apart like Saturn and mars

Back when I heard ya single, I wanted to be ya b-side
They used to say we like Jigga and Be, started to see
— Why, Jigga would cheat
Ya threw my ass on the street, now we Nas and Kelis

How can it be right, when everything is wrong?
But i'm a take her back, hoping that this shit stop
I only do ya coz I love ya, you were my culture
Coz who I’m talking bout y’all is hip hop, is hip hop
