Something to hold on to (X5

Is there anything that I can do for you, darlin'
To get you next to me
There and nobody but you
There ain't nobody that does it for me
You're that one of a kind, baby
The whole thing's got me?
Look so sweet, I got to make you all mine (x2)
You make me feel stingy and whatnot
I only want you, cause you're all that I got

[Hook]
You give me something
Something to hold on to (x5)

At night when I close my eyes and think of you
Your face like fresh air in this clouded mind of things to do
And I wonder if you're feelin' the same way
I wonder if you're doin' the same thing
Or is it just me?
Cause I wanna be the one and only
And I know that shit sounds corny, but it's the way that I feel
I just wanna be with you (X2)

[Hook](X2)
