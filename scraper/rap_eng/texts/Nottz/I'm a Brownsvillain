[Intro]
All I wanted to do was rhyme nigga
You know say mic check 1-2-1-2-1-2
Turn my mic up, check one two
And the rest of that old punk shit
Motherfuckers just ain't care
Like I ain't, like I ain't really 'bout this shit
C'mon.. I'mma start off calm for these motherfuckers

[Hook 2X: Lil' Fame]
Yo I'm a Brownsvillain, chillin and I don't give a fuck
About a killin cause I'm still in effect when you're illin
(C'MON! HO, HO, HO)

[Lil' Fame over Hook]
Check check, yo yo...
Uhh, uhh, get it...

[Lil' Fame]
It's a big boy game bitch and I'm diesel, it gets lethal
It's Lil' Fame a/k/a Clarence the 5th Beatle
I'm kosher, my paradigm is Hebrew
It's +Common Sense+ dawg, I do it for +The People+
They don't wanna rap in the session, with slap in the session
That's like standin by Yasser Arafat in the session
And the outcome is critical, no jokin
Smoked with 4-5's but the sign said no smokin

[Billy Danze]
Okay I see 'em (lining up, lining up) assemble your crew
If he sharp (sign him up, sign him up) back to do what we do
So for you (time is up, time is up) we, the legendary M.O.P
(Define what's up) we, keep it crunk (WE)
Could give a fuck (I SEE) your mouth bigger than your gun
And your heart (it ain't your role) you ain't playin your part
Lil' nigga be smart, or get a hole pushed through
The back of your tatters for thinkin that I'm average or soft

[Hook] + ad libs

[Lil' Fame]
Aiyyo your time is up (cause this Mo' Peez) wisen up
(M.O.P.!) We size 'em up, my niggas is live as fuck
We give 'em the whole thing, do you bodily harm
Bitch, we don't wanna party wit'chall
Pardon me par, sometimes I act retardedly par
Pop one in your wig, two more in your body and heart
On GP (nigga) cause we don't walk it out and talk it out
We stalk 'em out and chalk 'em out (Bill Danze, whattup?)

[Billy Danze]
That's my nigga he understands real, that's Fizzy wo'
Only nigga that understand Bill, I keep it low
So you never know how the man feel (the GANGSTA)
Got a different kind of appeal, you niggas ain't really real
I don't cruise past you dudes, I hover over you fools
Makin you nauseous, I'm big with it bitch I'm flawless
The 'Ville shit is cordless, when out of town I'm down with it
You clown niggas need to be cautious

[Hook] + ad libs
