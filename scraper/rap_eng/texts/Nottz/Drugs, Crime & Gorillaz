[Chorus: Termanology]
You got drugs, crime and gorillas
You got drugs, crime and gorillas
You got drugs, crime, gorillas

[Verse 1: Termanology]
In the back of the Lac, duffle bag in the trunck
Dog, you full of shit, and I'm not full of shit
Couple clips, 2 blunts of haze
2 4 fifths with no tints, right
Let me take you on a ride, where thugs, run and supply
For big chips, like, get nots, and bring m to Nots
A monster, I copped, then I chopped
The profet, I boxed it
On blocks that I conckered, and stocks that I I done give to them blocks
Them convicts will pop it, every morning, don't stop it
That watch on your arm, should be gone, cause them cops
See you goin to them blocks, seen it all, but they not singin your songs
From Comptin to Queens, them cops give you warrents
For watchin them corners, so watch for me, flawliss

[Chorus: Termanology]
You got drugs, crime and gorillas
You got drugs, crime and gorillas
You got drugs, crime, gorillas

[Verse 2: Sheak Louch]
You got drugs, and all these thugs, and all these slugs
Hoppin outside these clubs, fuck that, I got heat for m
Grippin the bottle and the bag, keep the bottle in the bag
Throttlin the bag, hopped out, and barbicued the fag
So sad, big man
I'm a criminal, homie, and I done fight some bitches, no sibliminal, homie
Parked the whip, flip my phone, light my bong
I know it's earli, but crack the Patroan, it's on
Silverbakc gorilla, white T, bitches on my dick
Leave the club, 3 bitches in the whip
In this game, I'm like Waid, stackin up them chips
Banna clip, AK, taped up shit
I told you we spray rounds, I'll kill you with it
Ridin with Termanology, my philosophy is murder
And all that other shit, you never heard of

[Chorus: Termanology]
You got drugs, crime and gorillas
You got drugs, crime and gorillas
You got drugs, crime, gorillas

[Verse 3: Freeway]
You can put the moon in my left hand, the sun in my right
And I still won't be done with the mic
Whippin with Mike, catchin a tool in his left hand, breakin his right
Cake whipper, they thinkin the same way, but my brain's different
Look, bitch, it's the same way, except my chain's bigger
More paper to play, when we can move the plannet
Take care of the dammage, I'm doin the damage
I'm causin the panic, your boy is expanding
From Cali to Florida, I rush your body, my body's more than ya
At lantic to Pasific, the Atlantic would be Pasific
I'm hittin Atlanta, and I'm landin in the middle
Then it's back to Philly, where it's chilly, nigga

[Chorus: Termanology]
You got drugs, crime and gorillas
You got drugs, crime and gorillas
You got drugs, crime, gorillas
