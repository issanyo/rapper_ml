[Intro: Blu]
Uh huh, uh huh
Mic check
Listen up

[Hook: Sample, Blu]
[?]
Yes, indeed

[Verse 1: Blu]
It goes everybody is looking for the answers, askin' a machine, vaccine, AIDS, cure cancer
Legalize cannabis, an average american, evolution of man, new era discovered
With new color, the rise of the dollar, the return of Christ, the rarely united one god, one race, one face
Earth, the blue love, the black memory space
I dug a mind and a mind pulled out was my mine, and realigned time with sunshine
Started with the heart, spark to the hands, rebuilt the home, became old man
But the heads need to work the hard, worship
Heads don't even know what hard to earn is
As a kid growing up one thing I learned is
(Before you die)
You only got one life to live

[Hook: Sample]
[?]

[Verse 2: Blu]
As the nation is waiting on reparations, I dated the red dress in Matrix
Medicated, duck in undercover man agent
[?] alien, saint in asylum, abused by authority in a corporate climate, air condition
You question [?] the way you living it
Job is your freedom and a jail under the law
I call freedom dumb, cause we already free
I call the kingdom dumb, cause he stopped to be a king
I call the wisdom, cause he is dumb. Wisdom is so much to get we forget what we gotta get for
Promotion of the orphan and satisfaction of slavery, the taste of pollution and exclusion of abortion
You ask yourself what is really important, put your priorities in order before you a god's [?]
Nobody is a [?] except the feeling and guiltin', ignorance in a sense, raw in a sense, and wrong in a sense

[Hook: Sample, Blu]
What if we started at the zenith, and walked into this world at completion
Would you start depleting it cause you can't compete with it
Do you subtract from it cause you can't add to it
Cause that makes sense
