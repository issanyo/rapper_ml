[Hook: Tess]
City lights, city lights, city lights, we ain’t slowing down
City lights, city lights, ‘cause we live the fast life
City lights, city lights, city lights, yeah we want it now
City lights, city lights, city lights, we ain’t slowing down
City lights, city lights, ‘cause we live the fast life
City lights, city lights, city lights, yeah we want it now

[Verse One: Emilio Rojas]
And they make it seem; the city has everything you can dream
Ain’t living to the limit, we living beyond our means
Maintaining images, anything that you need
Addicted to the spending, nobody gon’ intervene
Got to earn that dough then burn that dough then get them newest clothes
In a city where everybody late on paying bills and student loans
We looking fly but we struggling, who would know?
We party every night ‘cause we comforted by the glow baby

[Hook]

[Verse Two: Emilio Rojas]
We don’t go to bed, spending every minute we awake
Painting that coda red, landlord, everybody owe them bread
But they rather go out and blow they checks
We balling out but falling out on top of sofa beds, broke
With a little bit of dough but they made it stretch just like a yoga bend
We know perception is the key to our successes
But people gonna judge our efforts by the streets and our addresses
We be impressing, living where them rents is high
Come get desensitized by all the crime and gentrify, yeah

[Hook]

[Verse Three: Emilio Rojas]
I’mma shine bright in the limelight, get that crib with a sky light
When I get my mind right, then my grind gonna make that my life
And that high life, we chasing it, faking it till we making it
I’mma go from living in the basement to making atheists have faith in it
Women that were acting afraid of it will be begging me to let me put they face in it
And I ain’t ever giving credit when I pay for shit ‘cause I’mma be rich
I won’t pay for shit, yeah, I’mma move you when I’mma make that list of who’s who
Till I got a room with a pool view, I be in the lights as cool blue
