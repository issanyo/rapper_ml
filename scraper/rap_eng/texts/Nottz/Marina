[Verse 1: Mickey Factz]
20 grand on the rocks, back seat vibe
Call a Uber for myself on a taxi ride
The 3 lines on my sweats yell leisure
They match both my sneakers
Headed to the marina
Told 'em let me get his aux
Play that new pilot talk
He was cool with it, now we riding off
Cruising while the top is off, Mazel tov
Got a new thang she a black widow so I call her Romanoff
Heard her husband died from a molotoff
That's one of my business
Left a tip for the driver, cause a brother dipping
Door open up, see DZA in the trenches
Robe to his ankles looking ignant
Harlem world pimping
Cigar from El Salvador
Tuna steak, I dont mess with albacore
They lighting the marijuan
While I carry on
Sunsetting, ripple effect on the sundresses
Wave racing, I love jetting

[Hook: Mack Wilds]
Pour up some wine and let your mind get free
Roll up a vine and smoke a little OG
And all of the dimes around get it
Know that they could get it
But they playin' lowkey
All of the vibes in here feelin' a little smoother
Than a summer breeze on the summer's eve, yea
And everybody tryna catch the flow
I think I gotta let you know

[Verse 2: Smoke DZA]
Lit that green, I got this bomb from Hiroshima
[India?] at the Malina, gettin' ate out by a [?]
They playin' clean out while thirsty, Aquafina
Fresh off a flight, just got a kite, about to head to the marina
I rock arenas, huggin' the [?]
I promise that nothin' will ever come between us
I'm at the docks, road draggin' like Red Fox fresh out the cleaners
Fuck your opinion, it could never mean much
Full sale, playing alone Willie Hutch, burn Mary Jane
Three bitches feeding me grapes like Daddy Kane
Oh, you mad? Ain't that a shame
Use therapy cause jealousy's an ugly thing

[Bridge: Mack Wilds]
Marina, marina, marina, marina

[Hook: Mack Wilds]
Pour up some wine and let your mind get free
Roll up a vine and smoke a little OG
And all of the dimes around get it
Know that they could get it
But they playin' lowkey
All of the vibes in here feelin' a little smoother
Than a summer breeze on the summer's eve, yea
And everybody tryna catch the flow
I think I gotta let you know

[Verse 3: Curren$y]
I bought that Rolls just to prove a point
A brung your favourite hoes through to smoke a joint
Step into the shoes of the smoothest dude to ever
Lace clubs up, take you to school like the bus
Sharpen your tools before you try foolin' with us
Niggas get killed for not being real
Pump my low riders [?] can you feel
Rollin' that gas, that Presidential Clinton build
Ain't no if, muthafucka, it's when I will
Stunt on you muthafuckas, buy an angel chrome grille
Dug in the mud and I built all this here
That castle has appeared where once there was thin air

[Bridge: Mack Wilds]
Marina, marina, marina, marina

[Hook: Mack Wilds]
Pour up some wine and let your mind get free
Roll up a vine and smoke a little OG
And all of the dimes around get it
Know that they could get it
But they playin' lowkey
All of the vibes in here feelin' a little smoother
Than a summer breeze on the summer's eve, yea
And everybody tryna catch the flow
I think I gotta let you know
