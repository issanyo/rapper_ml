[Intro: Shateish]
Never been so hurt
There was no one to care
Since my very first breath on Earth
There was no one ever there

[Verse 1]
My father left me when I was seven, at a home
Left me but took his chrome, I looked up and blood was gone
Man, fuck it, guess in the world I'm all alone
My mother was too na√Øve so when he left she followed along
And while you're listenin' to this song, askin' yourself why
It's really none of your business but I was there, I bear witness
To a grown fuckin' man with a bid
Unzipped his pants and I can't tell you what a pig
Me and my sister had different fathers, but I cared, and I loved her
And I'd be lyin' if I told you I wasn't scared, when he rubbed her
Tip of his penis on her, she was only 11
How could you ever get a boner?
Even thinkin' about it make me hot as a sauna
Make me wanna pop him like the top on Coronas
But I was scared, ran back to my room, prayed to God
That I was dreamin', can't believe I'm this nigga's semen
Livin' with demons and it'd been that way

[Hook: Shateish]
Never been so hurt
There was no one to care
(Don't give a fuck about me)
Since my very first breath on Earth
There was no one ever there
(Don't give a fuck about me)

[Bridge]
These niggas can't fuck with this shit
I'll make you slit your wrist
This, sort of like the exodus
It's, you see it
The moon bleedin', it's a bloody moon
You see it
It's a bloody moon
You see it
It's a bloody moon
The moon bleedin', it's a bloody moon

[Hook: Shateish]
Never been so hurt
There was no one to care
(Don't give a fuck about me)
Since my very first breath on Earth
There was no one ever there
(Don't give a fuck about me)
