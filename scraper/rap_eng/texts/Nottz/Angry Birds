[Verse One] [Starboy]:
Aye look
See I'm the opposite of G's down, hoes up
Chickens get mad slash your tires, cut your clothes up
You know the type of shit, flip up incitin' shit
Always in the club, gettin' drunk tryin' to fight a bitch
You know how it be when the liks get in 'em
Better muzzle up they beak when the dick get in 'em
Boy
Fuck what you heard mayne
No real gwap for 'em, chicken feed of them bird brains

[Big Shot]:
Listen
She's showin' her ass, carryin' on
Hell has no fury like a black woman scorn
Big Bird ass
Face real cute
Got hurt in the past, she bitter like grape fruit
Miller Lite's all night, wanna fight wanna rustle
Suck your worm in the morning, that's that early bird special
Facebook status, start rumors, spread gossip
With that attitude, you'll never be fly just like an ostrich

[Chorus] [Nottz]:
Now, I ain't got no time for no angry birds
Never talkin', just squawkin' that's bullshit
They keep screamin' from the top of they lungs
I can't distinguish your words, baby girl so calm down
You an angry
Bird
You an angry
Bird
You an angry
Bird
You an angry
Bird
Just an angry
Bird
Just an angry
Bird
You an angry
Bird

[Verse Two] [Nottz]:
It's only day two and yep, we still arguin'
She's steady screamin' mad cause I ain't listenin'
She's back on and talkin' bullshit again
On how she wishes she would have never moved in
And I'm sittin' here thinkin' on ways to get her out
I swear I love her, just not the shit that comes out her mouth
These childish games
Just extra stress
All this sluggin' for real
Just give this shit a rest

[Ivory Keyes]:
First it was cool
Shawty has a little attitude
But then she kept whinin' like she needed some food
So I fed her with the knowledge, told her "You do you."
She kept whinin'
I didn't know what to do
So I smacked upside the head told her, "Bitch get bread."
She got herself together then she bit my head
I wasn't raised
I never kept a bitch in a cage
So when she tried to fly she fell dead on her face

[Chorus] [Nottz]:
Now, I ain't got no time for no angry birds
Never talkin', just squawkin' that's bullshit
They keep screamin' from the top of they lungs
I can't distinguish your words, baby girl so calm down
You an angry
Bird
You an angry
Bird
You an angry
Bird
You an angry
Bird
Just an angry
Bird
Just an angry
Bird
You an angry
Bird

[Verse Three] [Big Shot]:
Mad for no reason you ain't nothin' but a pterodactyl
Fuck Adam, that bitch Eve needs a rotten apple
I'm the king, you was my queen, I threw you out the castle
You muscle face ass bitch
We can fuckin' wrestle
With a sharp ass knife
I might fuckin' stab you
You fuckin' Dodo
AKA dumb hoe
Whoever put you up on that pedestal, I make it crumble
Don't make me catch you on the scene, turn your back to ?

[Boogie]:
My momma taught me to cook, clean, earn the green
She even taught me to sew sew
Anytime you wanna leave, you can go hoe
Bitch
I'm walkin' mojo
I came from a bloodline of pimps
I will Nino Brown, Rosay bottle, cancel that bitch
Share her with the whole team
Let 'em sample that bitch
They call me handlebars the way I handle that bitch
I make 'em believe that's word to me cause
Two things I never seen
A U.F.O. and a bitch I need
Now

[Chorus] [Nottz]:
Now, I ain't got no time for no angry birds
Never talkin', just squawkin' that's bullshit
They keep screamin' from the top of they lungs
I can't distinguish a word, baby girl so calm down
You an angry
Bird
You an angry
Bird
You an angry
Bird
You an angry
Bird
Just an angry
Bird
Just an angry
Bird
You an angry
Bird
