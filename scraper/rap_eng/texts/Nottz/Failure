[Diggy Simmons]
I know you’ve all been waiting patient
The game’s been needing some stimulation
Too much faking, all the visual simulation
I’m all natural, y’all made from concentration
We are not adjacent, ladies say that I’m cute, haters say I’m a fluke
They try to ruffle my branches but never get to my roots
Don’t compare me to niggas that’s in my age group
If anything, compare me to people you’re giving praise to
Yawa, Jesus, y’all are all hateful
All the heat I gave you, y’all should be grateful
Stop treating a nigga like I’m in grade school
Spitting like a post grad, I don’t need a notepad
No jeweler but I be dropping gems like a topaz
I hear ‘em talking but I let ‘em rant
’Cause I’m a young baller coming up, Kevin Durant
Yeah I live with my parents but I bring revenue in
I don’t curse but your favorite words are two shorts
Lyrically, my aim’s to kill you lames like Newports
You can’t get me ‘cause I’m not even living
I’m dark matter, energy trapped in the physical prison
And my side you’ve been waiting for is finally risen
After the B.E.T Cipher, now you finally listen
There’s a few still hissing like an alley cat kitten
I’ll have you scallywags bitten from my lyrical composition
Yeah, I am he, yeah, let that breath
The underrated, underdog, underage, underestimated
But I will never be underpaid ‘cause I oversee ‘em, overpower, overthrow ‘em
Had to run for a minute but now it’s over for ‘em
I can run with the best of ‘em, shun the rest of ‘em
Oh that’s your idol, watch me make you think less of ‘em
I am he, yeah, let that breath…
