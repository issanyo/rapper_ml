[Verse 1: Nottz]

Yeah

Yeah (uh)

Uh

Now, this club ain't built dawg
Fa all of us
We tear the fucka up
Straight fuck the fucka up
Collapse the ceilings
Caved-in walls 'n shit
Or find a 'Lac parked
At the bar in the bitch
All you small-time fucks
Magnify this shit
Snap a picture
This is how we do in the bitch
Fuck the ass shakin'
Better get ya ass ta vacatin'
'Fore you fill the extra spot
Wit a morgue statement
DMP the squad
Mothafucker, don't forget it
Act senile if ya want
And watch them things start ta hittin'
Legs, arm, head
Ya ass 'bout ta fall off
This ride is type dangerous, pa
You should jumped off
It B.I
Nottz Raw wit J D.I
We keep it crackalackin'
From the V to tha D (D!)
We keep it crackalackin'
From the V to tha D (the D)
We keep it crackalackin'
From the V to tha D
The D
D (d)
D (d)

[Hook: J Dilla]

Up in the cluuuuub
Up in the cluuuuub

Up in the cluuuuub

[Verse 2: Boogie]

Uh
I told y'all (uh)
I don't dance, youngin
Back of the club
Chicks around me
Yeah they're family
They let the Mac in the club (a-ha!)
Lean back, hater
You don't want to get trapped in the club (trapped in the club)
Slapped in the club (slapped in the club)
Beat down
Boom bapped in the club
Fucka
It'll get so ugly
Boogie like the Emperor with a New Groove
You could look but don't touch me (uh huh)
Rolled in like a hundred deep
Wit niggas that got no real name like
Murder and Street (What up?)
A bad drinker face
Probably hurl in your sink (illl)
Lookin' for shorties with heels
Probably hurtin' their feet (uh huh)
Get 'em drunk and be ready to dip
That's why I'm at the bar wit her like
"Go ahead... Take one more sip"
Durte rolled in on 700s
Like a bike club
Fuck around and turn this nightclub
Into a Fight Club
Might hurt somebody
This ain't no fuckin' rap
DMP, J Dilla
Who's fuckin' wit dat? (huh?)
