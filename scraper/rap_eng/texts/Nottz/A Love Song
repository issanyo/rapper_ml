[Verse One]
Come on and go with me
Cause all this company ain't my cup of tea
And we can go somewhere
Whenever, where ever, whatever like Maxwell
And it will be alright
Me and you, one on one tonight
I just want to crown you or maybe I'll wife you
Triple homicide charge, 30 to life you
And I want to love you, feel you and hug you
Come here let me thank you, kiss you and spank you
Take you to the moon baby and if I could
If loving you is wrong then I don't know no good

[Hook: RL]
For all the things that
I done put you through
And all the times I, didn't do right by you
You didn't have to stick around but you did
So this is for you
Girl this is all for you you
You you, for you
Girl this is for you

[Verse Two]
Yo, I know you used to them other lovers
They want to wine and dine you, then sucker for love brothers
I, I let a lot of women before and it's true
But none of them was quite like you
From your ass to your smile to your beautiful skin
And all the love faces you make when getting it in
So sexy
Aye, what you want me to say?
Tell them other chickens bounce but I beg you to stay
Where you going?
You got me up on some new ish
With my homies all night and I'm chucking the deuces
You got me thinking you could mother my kids shawty
But eff though, it is what it is

[Hook]

[Verse Three]
I swear she an angel make a thug write a love song
What's between her thighs make you harmonize like
(Ooooh oooooh)
Girl you look good I, want to make you all mine
Banging like Alpine back in the Impala
Loving your persona
Cinnamon aroma
Diabetic coma
Make you wanna holler
Give me the keys to your heart if you wanna
Here for the long stay, want to be the owner
Let's make music, Prince/Apollonia
Apple of my cornea
Girl your love bang, [?]

[Verse Four: Nottz]
Cinderella one shoe, that's a princess
The guy the prince that's 'bout to be a king in a few
We 52 and O, we 'bout to have a ring in a few
Pop the cork, count the cash and maybe breeze in a few
And we gone ha
All your friends is mad
The homie saying I'm Usher in the rain boy you got it bad
I told 'em pay [?] we estimate on things you never had
Life is fab' we just throw it in a bag
Like that

[RL]
For all the things that
I done put you through
Forgive me, let me, make it up to you
I am sorry, a nigga, be tripping
This song is for you, baby won't you listen?

[Hook]
