Verse 1

Hmmm
These lil niggas don't respect nothing
Til you gotta take ya belt off and check something
Bomb atomically
Socrates
Mopping these
Disrespectful niggas down the block
Inspektah Deck something
We need less fronting
More real shit
Nowadays they ain't happy til you kill shit
Disrespect I won't tolerate or deal with
Especially if them muthafuckers still kids
I ain't ya age lil nigga go do ya homework
I was bangin when niggas was wearin long shirts
I was whylin when niggas was really on turfs
Yep, when snitchin get ya sister and ya mom murked
I ain't ya peer lil nigga go get ya daddy
He dont wanna fight he talkin bout ADD ME
Puttin it out there
It is what it is
Tell shorty respect his elders cuz i beat people's kids!




CHORUS (x2)

Imma take my belt off
And whoop this nigga ass
Up the middle of the street
Nah, he dont get a pass
He violating codes so you know how it goes
You gon respect this nigga
I take my belt off



Verse 2



I look in his eyes and see his soul
When I do that shit I know I'm in control
I know he sorry but he gotta learn a lesson
If you cross the wrong OG you won't make it to ya session
Shorty got a lot of mouth
Had a couple fights
So he feel he Money May
Mixed wit a young Mike
But he ain't made of iron
And yea i came wit iron
That could stop a wild elephant
And kill the bravest lion
Lord knows i tried talkin to him
But i can see his whole demeanor when im walkin to him
And since he feel like he a man
Imma drop him where he stands
Respect ain't an option its somethin' that I demand
I ain't ya bot lil nigga mira tu boca
I put the toaster to you chochas...no mas!
Respect the presence of excellence
I made it possible for you to be a resident
And walk around freely
We put in work dawg
Dont get hurt dawg
How you tough and you wearing colorful skirts dawg
Keep yappin , imma take my fuckin belt off!
You understand me?
