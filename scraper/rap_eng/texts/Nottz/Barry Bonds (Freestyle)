[Verse]
It's what you all been waiting for ain't it
Your weekly entertainment
For me to get a hold of this beat and go 'head, claim it
I'm about to paint a picture, you niggas go 'head, frame it
Since we gettin Seinfeld on some Jerry and Elaine shit
I flow far from mediocre
And if we talking cards I will fold him with the poker
You and your whole crew are like a deck of 54
So it's obvious ya'll gone steady be rollin with some jokers
And me I'm rolling with some brokers
Like damn could you niggas get any broker?
I got my new girl so content
Just save yourself the embarrassment, don't even approach her
Disguise your self, go buy a costume
I am making stock works, while you working stock rooms
(ughh) and I was praying I would drop June
But label reps applying pressure to make them pop tunes
So I keep it rocking for Pete's sakes
You fake gangsta rappers a clich√©
And if you ain't talking dough when you meet Drake
I'll be all in your face, like, "No speak-a la ingles"
Soon as you hear it you quote it
They try to be the one that I done left out the show with
But trust me I'm aware, and my cars right there
Is this interior enough for ya'll ulterior motives
Cause if you like it ya'll should stick with me
My money good, I ain't never had to flip a ki
Alotta ice, alotta cream like Dickey Dee
Might cut the phone and disapear like Mishy Me
But I'mma try and have you on the trip with me
Slid in threw a Henri Bendel like it's slippery
And your ex man is a hater officially
Probably cause he know I'm exactly what you wish he be
Yeah that's the reason why he looking hard
Cause I've done snatched the chips ahoy out the cookie jar
He just mad cause his girl's at the house
With her tongue sticking out like a Michael Jordan rookie card
Let me address this, pardon me while I fix
A couple subliminal lines caught me in the mix
I guess he thought he could of been Gotti in the flix
But at this point I'm just poking a body with a stick
Nowadays rapping is a children's hobby
And girls keep telling me I'm still this snobby
I tell them myself who I am feeling probably
Just because I got a buzz like a building lobby
It ain't a song that your ass finna skipp
I tried to sell weed, give me cash for this zip
The way your girlfriend pumped me up in the car
Seem like she don't really need no gas for the trip
Millionaire shades, fade with the waves
I smirk at a nigga if he still rocking braids
That just let's me know that we ain't on the same page
And that goes out to every nigga except Trey
I'm outta here baby
They asked me about the past years and how does it phase me
I wouldn't take it back, naww not if they pay me
Mr. betcha that's expensive cause it's not a fugazi
Spittin a crock pot of bottemless gravy
The shit is so nasty, how is it tasty?
And you can probably find him walking out of a Macy's
Forget it girl, they just thinking how to replace me
Exit with a joke, leave these niggas some hope
You took that Ye beat and put that shit in a choke
Well I'm thinking I should leave out on this note
Nigga keep your two cents I ain't tryna leave you broke

[Refrain]
Life of a Don, lights keep glowing
Come up in the club with that fresh shit on
And something crazy on my arm, uh-ahem
And here's another hit, Barry Bonds
