[Hook] [May Marquardt]:
Looking back to the day when you said I wouldn't make it far
I had to promise myself no tears and I'm so sincere, I don't care who you are
I'll never be afraid of pain
You got to dance in the heavy rain
So when it's coming down on me
It's only motivation

[Verse One] [Kardinal Offishall]:
Yo, you never know what you have until you lose everything
The love and your sanity, nigga 'erything
Years back I had felt agoraphobic
All the fire that I had, it's like the devil done stole it
Read it on my mom's face
She couldn't camouflage
Any of the hurt, it's like the Earth felt sabotaged
The pressure for the first time, ?, Mr. Get Up And Go, couldn't leave the bed layin' in
For months on end I was the subject of a prayer chain
Everyday losing stripes like a candy cane
Realizing that nobody really noticed that I didn't come around
They assumed that I was out of town
But I was out and down
Until one day, my mom and my cousin came through and said, "Look around
Yo, no matter how bad your life feeling
You gotta keep your spirit to the ceiling."
That love is motivation

[Verse Two] [Big Pooh]:
A few years on the road now I'm sitting in the crizzib
Shades drawn, Little Brother gone, people livid
Me? I'm in another space, focused on the past
Depressed about the future cause I couldn't get passed
Me
Starting over
So I'm inching closer to the point of no return
Where I'm feeling rap's over
A few months period
The mind is a meriod
Looking in the mirror, like "Nigga are you serious?"
My girl looking at me like, "Nigga you delirious?"
No matter where I turn, see the message was ubiquitous
Get up, get out and stop sulking
No more Lou Ferrigno, time to turn into The Hulk and
Smash on these niggas, thank the doubters for supportin'
Big Dho coaching, I'm starring on the court and
No more role playing for this beat dragon slayer
Return of the rapper, you should kneel and say a prayer
I'm here
