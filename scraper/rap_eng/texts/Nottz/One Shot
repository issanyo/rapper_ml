[Verse 1: KRS-One]
I go on and on, my philosophies are strong
As you can see, these other old schoolers are gone
I'm on top of New York like King Kong
These other sounds are falling, ring the alarm
I wear rappers out like Sean John
Hit 'em like a bong, blow 'em out like Chong
Y'all got it all wrong
If you a true artist, you know it ain't all about selling songs
It's all about letter wars and metaphors
Creating better tours, I think y'all better pause
I spit just because and rip rappers for the love of it
Ah, man, for the fuck of it
I'd rather fast and pray
But y'all wanna thug this shit, so let's get these guns out
Others donate, from my hands
It's in your pocket pulling all your funds out

[Chorus: Pharoahe Monch]
Yes, KRS-One, Buckshot, split it
Up the middle you only get one shot
Get it? One Shot? Meaning half of both of their names
Or better yet, I figure you better have aim
Now pick a style, any style, choose one
Political rap, conscious, crap, guns
The score's tied, no time on the clock
Better hit the bulls-eye, see what you got, one shot

[Verse 2: Buckshot]
I go on and on
My philosophy, I gotta see the best hater perform
Come on, who do it better than us?
BS to BK stay reppin' with us
Worldwide, Boot Camp Click till we D.O.A
BDP, your beat don't play
Get it together, buck sittin' in leather
While you sittin' in your cloth and scratching your balls
Try to figure out how I do it
Even though you sell more records I'm still next to you, kid
I don't give a fuck about numbers
If I did, I'd jerk every artist like [?] does
Now you wanna rock the game
But you not Buckshot so you can't rock my name
(Look at you) It's a goddamn shame
Niggas got big money but still got a small brain

[Chorus: Pharoahe Monch]
Yes, KRS-One, Buckshot, split it
Up the middle you only get one shot
Get it? One Shot? Meaning half of both of their names
Or better yet, I figure you better have aim
Now pick a style, any style, choose one
Political rap, conscious, crap, guns
The score's tied, no time on the clock
Better hit the bulls-eye, see what you got, one shot

[Verse 3: Buckshot]
Okay
You ain't seen a man beat the odd like me since OJ
No way, what can I say?
Motherfuckers be hustling hard, high hopes and low pay
Don't play, look at the game, who is the ref
To blow the whistle on the bullshit you do with your breath?
Next, as a matter of fact, right now
I'ma go left, see if you [?] right now
Yes, you don't even know your website
That's like having a fight facing a lead pipe, no light
So I'ma guide you like the soap opera
I'm so proper [?] no problem
Goblins, goons
Niggas with crack balloons yelling for more Black Moon
Soon! For now y'all niggas bow to the Buck
This ain't a movie when I got y'all yellin', "Cut"

[Chorus: Pharoahe Monch]
Yes, KRS-One, Buckshot, split it
Up the middle you only get one shot
Get it? One Shot? Meaning half of both of their names
Or better yet, I figure you better have aim
Now pick a style, any style, choose one
Political rap, conscious, crap, guns
The score's tied, no time on the clock
Better hit the bulls-eye, see what you got, one shot

[Outro: Buckshot]
Buckshot
You stop the camera

Everyday we back now, KRS back now, what
