I’m over taxed and underpaid in salary
Blue collar, work hard for same mentality
New York state of mind, slave to the grind
Zoning out in day time to escape reality
Refuse to face it when the music’s playing
I’m in a psychedelic hallucination
Tripping out on some Curtis Mayfield
Numb to the pain, Novocain how my face feel
You seen that tape real, the whole team know
Why we out in va, sipping Mojitos
Squash in eagles, it’s swatting mosquitoes
When you’re rocking with the boys not in ...sloan
Cooking it up, pot scheming on the stove
Watching my seeds grow, you reaper just soul
Either punch in the clock, either leave it alone
Me and ...job, till got a seat at the throne

[Hook]
To rise and fall, understand that every good thing come to a heart ache
But that ain’t gonna stop me
I’m here until the end baby
And if you choose to follow
Know that there’s no shortcuts to the promise land
But that wouldn’t ever stop me
I’m here until the end baby


No, I ain’t bout no games about my BI
Something low in the bucket you can’t see I
Ride slow, with the windows low and the beam’s high
No l, just a ... I don’t give a fuck
I call that man ...Howard
When that bitch crack your ass better duck
Tryina stack my paper up and cop a few dirties
But my empire enjoy life with my...
Like I said, I’m tryina stack that bread
No time for hungry ass hoe, tryina ... my bread
And any monkey ass disappear, when your pockets ain’t fit
A bunch of David Blaines, dealing with this kind of folks you won’t have a thing
25/8 the boys stay on this grizzle main
Won’t stop until my name’s surrounded by them shiny thangs


[Murs]
I’m unstoppable, anything is possible
Leverage in my love overcoming any obstacle
The type of love that put hate up in the hospital
They tried to find they cure but the found it was inoperable
Came no summer, you never knew winter
You ain’t been a looser, you ain’t a true winner
It ain’t always is champagne dinners
I’m about a buck 50 but I used to be...
Mixing lunch meat with my scrambled egg
The last thing I ate before I went to bed
The first thing I ate when I woke up
One minute eh, I think about it, I get choked up
But I never compromise my integrity
And cause of that, a lot of niggas got ahead of me
And now that you’re falling off steadily
And all the bullshit I went through is a memory
