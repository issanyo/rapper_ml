This is what I'm dealin', bout to make a killin' off illin off-a hydro
Put it on a rapper like they workin out Tae Bo
Here to make a statement, not on your game
You're gon' catch it like the pavement
Cause all that blasé blah ain't hittin
And so from this point on we straight spittin', yeah what!

My shit is tight, if not the damn tightest
My stats stay bubblin' how Pepsi and Sprite is
I make a bitch jealous to the point she wanna slice this
I fuck a nigga head up like the ex-girl turned dyke bitch
The nicest, on one like unicyclists
With pussy running deeper than stab wounds from ice-picks
Now where you bout to take it? Baby I done took it
Some more Digga Digga... shit man, look in here
Folks are spittin rhymes unruly
MC's for real might catch a hock-ptooie
Cause all that blasé blah ain't hittin
And so from this point on we straight spittin', yeah what!

I push the range on my Pop's Buick Regal
Hang wit' cats who known for making drug money legal
Dislike you, spit on purpose just to spite you
Heard you like the news, your boys died on motorcycles
I spit clean versions for under-aged rugrats
I spit for Brick City, where all my real thugs at
I spit shit cause I'm in a bad mood
For when my life wasn't shit but bad weed and fast food
I spit spit spit and make executive decisions
I spit some shit for all the scrubs and the pigeons
And best believe where I'm goin' you're a goner
I spit more rhymes than silicone in California
I spit spit spit for all them jokers at the pool hall
Carrying my daughter on my back just to fool y'all
I meditate, say a prayer with my sensei
I spit on MTV all the way down to your mixtape
Like that, I'm the illest with the mouthpiece
Crazy like South Park and hotter than South Beach
Cause all that blasé blah ain't hittin'
And so from this point on we straight spittin', yeah what!

I spit shit and leave you scarred like a face-lift
I spit for the underground, Hot 97 be the Matrix
One, two, hit 'em with the basics
Who gon' stay hittin'? Who be straight spittin'?
I take the mic and rock it like what
I make you write, get wrecked tonight, what
Cause you never heard a honey spit rhymes like
Said you never heard a honey spit rhymes like
In a million years, and a million beers
Said you never heard a honey spit rhymes like
Cause all that blasé blah ain't hittin'
And so from this point on we straight spittin', yeah what!

When you hear a bitch rhyme, raise your lighters
Spittin' on behalf of Flipmode and Outsidaz
