[Chorus:] [x2]
You see, you know other replay
You see, you know this how it start

[Verse 1:]
I always heard that death can come in threes
And in case it win the last seen, call for my cousin last week
Saying he fucked around and left the show
And somebody find trying
They get some of that pussy pop, but she lied saying she got a roommate at home
They call her full college blow
Because the launch her in the upper zone
And sprawl her out on the couch, and had the keys at the door
The fuck was at the full worth to the wall
I thought you said it was your roommate

[Chorus]] [x2]

[Verse 2:]
Paul just got a call, beef, just got more shit to talk
This is why the brother lost his mind and must have pissed him off
Back and forth, smoke at his chaw, ran to the door
Blocks out of the box, Somebody waiting, niggas follow
Hit them now, the cause of a border wasn’t even yours
That she don’t got my cousin murdered
Kenny couldn’t have been murdered
Doctors talk of plastic surgery, never gonna have to hurt her
I broke cheek bone, by some folks she knows
Since she straight out of a TV show
And know we don’t need no police now

[Chorus] [x2]

[Verse 3:]
This is the bottomline. I don’t got a lot
And We used to the things of my own
We don’t got time to play, no we don’t play no games
They deny and it’s over tonight

[Chorus] [x2]
