[Intro] [Phonte]
Let's ride
Uhh, uhh, uhh, let's ride
Uhh, uhh, uhh, let's ride

[Darien Brockington]
Gonna have a party, to release this thing that's on my mind
Hit the dance floor, two step my blues away

[Verse One] [Phonte]
Uhh, I'm gettin tired of the drama
Boss man said he would fire me
I told him I would gladly do the honors
So I just quit
Cause this work shit got my dreams on pause like a comma
But I'm still six-figure fiendin'
Bull city leanin, and +California Dreaming+
Like The Papas and The Mamas
The stress is toxic
But thank God a nigga got direct deposit
So
I'mma take this check and pay my rent up
Cause this weekend I'm goin out like a soldier
Put a little somethin down on the light bill
Let the cable and the phone bill roll over
As for the rest of my hard earned funds
I take a hundred dollars, put it all in ones
And take it to the Shake Club
Or hit the Elk's Lodge with the old folk
Let 'em see how it's done
Let's go

[Hook] [Darien Brockington]
Gonna have a party, to release this thing that's on my mind
Hit the dance floor, two step my blues away
[Phonte singing]
I've been working hard all day, just left my 9 to 5
Gotta make the money, the money can't buy you no peace of mind

[Rapper Big Pooh]
Around 10 I had to get myself together
I'm doin nothin', let me go do somethin' better
Gettin tired of layin' around, takin shots of the Crown
That's how life gets you down if you let her
Throw on some Stacy Adams and a sweater
Pull out the new coat with the leather
I'm headed straight to the Lodge, old school is in charge
Get your derbys out with the feather
Somebody's uncle is the bar now they clever
Cause he drinkin' all the drinks that he should be givin' out
Somebody momma up in here, she tryin' to turn it out
When I want to party, this is what I'm talkin' 'bout
Yeah, you got grown folk dancin'
Maurice White singin', everybody drankin'
The little cup of that oil ain't ever hurt nobody
Fo' cups later, life of the party

[Hook] [Darien Brockington]
Gonna have a party, to release this thing that's on my mind
Hit the dance floor, two step my blues away

[Phonte singing]
I've been working hard all day, just left my 9 to 5
Gotta make the money, the money can't buy you no peace of mind

[Phonte]
Stan play your horn baby

[Hook] [Darien Brockington]
Gonna have a party, to release this thing that's on my mind
Hit the dance floor, two step my blues away

[Phonte singing]
I've been working hard all day, just left my 9 to 5
Gotta make the money, the money can't buy you no peace of mind

[Outro] [Phonte]
Uhh, for all my steppers
For all my two steppers
E'rybody at the supper club, e'rybody at the VFW
E'rybody at the Elk's Lodge, all the old folk at the Command Post
Keep steppin' out, keep steppin' out
