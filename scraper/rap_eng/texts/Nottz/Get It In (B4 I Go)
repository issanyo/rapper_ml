[Intro]
Check check to check check yeah
Ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-chip
Check check to check check yeah

[Verse 1]
Four creative words on the vehicle, limousine vocabulary
Second degree murder when I see the stationary
Man slaughter when the bare is in my hand
Ignorant by association, middle finger man
No middle man straight when I won like eleven
Gun finger shape like seven shootin' to heaven
No dick riders in my session
Since the invention of internet I conversate with discretion
Whatever you learn when you learn it all is the best lesson
I'm projected from my lower intestine
Whoever the best, I'm testing
Semi private so I don't bug out if the blogs don't mention
Grew up in an area where tooney two stay is like Christmas
And long hair is nothing but extensions
This year's personas are nothing but inventions
Niggas speaking out of turn, looking for attention
Rap ain't nothing like the NBA
Cause these niggas shoot air balls expecting to get played
Close range in your face like Google earth
These niggas suck, trust me, they all booby first
Gerber babies tryna skip through initiations
Animals, see them march to war like animation
Almost the real thing but they claymation
Acting straight hard but these niggas straight Clay Aiken

[Hook]
I ain't doin' nothin' but sharp is on my JO
Couple bucks, couple friends, tryna get it in before I
Get it in before I, get it in before I
'Fore I, 'fore I go
I ain't doin' nothin' but sharp is on my JO
Couple bucks, couple friends, tryna get it in before I
Get it in before I, get it in before I
'Fore I, 'fore I go

[Verse 2]
You cannot stop the flow like prohibition
Every lyric releases a woman's inhibition
Every second is sabotagin' your prediction
I'm based on a true story, nigga, non-fiction
I kept spittin' hoping that one day the world would listen
A blue heads off with no use of nitroglycerine
And I ain't paused neither
Gettin' money sick like I got the fuck you fever
Nonbelievers get ether
Growing pains don't exist no more and there's no Mike Seaver
Cut off the baggage, no cleaver
That was me and my dead luminaries, no heater
Dead presidents make money seem loco
The government adjusted economy for my vocals
It seems farfetched but I'm so far ahead that when I'm running in place you still can't catch
And I'm on the home plate no uniform
No Bentley but I'm stayin' dry in the storm
Shout to Farnsworth, the world would seem easy to conquer with heaven as a sponsor
God over money, money over God
Sepirutto ain't working out, get a new Prada
Killing almost every rap nigga that you brought up
Only nigga better already been shot

[Hook]
I ain't doin' nothin' but sharp is on my JO
Couple bucks, couple friends, tryna get it in before I've
Get it in before I've, get it in before I've
'Fore I, 'fore I go
I ain't doin' nothin' but sharp is on my JO
Couple bucks, couple friends, tryna get it in before I
Get it in before I, get it in before I
'Fore I, 'fore I go

[Outro]
Only nigga better already been shot
