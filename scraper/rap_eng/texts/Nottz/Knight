[Verse 1]
So fucking dauntless when it comes being "on it"
Audit only the causes of bewilderment and awe
A top a mountain where I sit to watch the Autumn turn to August
It's just me there with my thoughts and also memories for songs
From the gauntlets to the straw hat
Incinerating all that stand between me and my goal of walking out amongst the stars and
Everybody knows that life is known to be drawback
Instead of giving in, you work around it then evolve
Yo, it's time to fascinate the face of mankind gently
In the wake of benign signs behind what's empty
So don't prompt me with moxie, I've trained with Ox-king
These obnoxious hearkeners about to box with Fonzie
Yeah
Son is the pseudonym. Congruent to influences
Alluded through a tune that I illuminate the moon
When free to move I take the scenic route
It's freedom from the dreary view I'm used to
Obtuse in this manner to get my feelings through

[Verse 2]
Amid the mist I sit. Weary from the action
I've been fighting way too long. Now I accept I'm geriatric
Can you hear me? No rehashing this. I'm teary cos I'm passionate
About the way when art comes in fruition from a sad event
The advent had arrived and thrived by building an establishment
Which tries to guide the lies away from Earth and it's inhabitants
Who had it with this rather twisted world of fucking manics
That was way back when before this vessel had pass in this
About to pack my bags and go and start a coalition
For the souls who put their souls into their lines when no one listens
So I'm distant from existence, and I'd rather be forgotten
Before leaving here with a ceded feeling of accomplishment
Gone

[Verse 3]
One more..
The reinforcement is a phoenix leaning towards the idea of resurrection fueled by unseen forces
The importance of endurance is immense when in this sport
And the only reason I'm rapping is for cash to buy me horses with
Of course it's been minute since I meta-morphed to lordship
Though in that span of time I've made known to not lock horns with this unborn threat to man
My canvas is the floor
I stay sharp cos every night I sleep in thickets of thorns
Torn apart. Rebuilt. Difficult to put together
Get the letters assimilated to form out a message
Which is a presage to oppressors who continue to disparage us
That we will not allow for you to think of us as characters
And better yet, the feathers that I left after I flew away
Is evidence that I arrived and tried to save the day
Keep in mind that when you see me I am just an apparition
While the last of my cares were given only to who listens
