[Ex's voice]
I love you!

[Verse One]
Yeah, Hmmm
I guess I could have learned to love you
Replace my sanity
With Kotex on the vanity
Put up with your habits
Reward your anxiety with carats
Substitute freedom for a marriage
I was quite in love with your odd behaviour and acting out
Waited quite a while just to tap you out
Thought you was digging Saukrates
Came to find out that me and you couldn't wait to get down to knocking knees
The first time I dug you out raw!!!
Pussy so good I disobeyed the first law
Never fall hard for the skin too soft
Unless you been through some real shit, beating the odds
Yeah
But I was still in love with my ex
[Ex] Hello?
I erased the pain every time we had (kiss) you know
Looking in your face but thinking about her
It's interesting seeing what we were
I wish I could talk to you

[Hook: Peter Jericho]
We once were
What we are
Never to be again
Now I look back
And laugh now
But it sure wasn't easy then
Loving you and wishing you genuinely felt the same
But it doesn't matter now, that was just a thought
We moved on
I just wanna talk to you

[Verse Two]
Girl you used to impress me
Clean the house and undress me
Giving me the sugar like Nestl√©
Never seen a girl from Jamaica who
Came to Toronto and celebrated Canada Day more than Gretzky
Big smiles
But when I found out about your ex man
Being abusive I couldn't understand
How did you believe in that?
You were nothing greater than a whore
Sometimes mental abuse hurts more
So I showed you what love should feel like
Ice cream dates on a late night
Very long talks on the phone
When you would breakdown and you stayed downtown
When you felt you couldn't reach home
I wonder what marriage would feel like
You never left me but something didn't feel right
Your red eyes were spelling it out
And you wondered what the yelling was about
[Ex] Hello?
I wish I could talk to you

[Hook]

[Verse Three]
We almost had a child
But we made mistakes that we couldn't take back
I hope God forgives for that
I used to look up at the moon, waiting outside your workplace
Me and you together seemed good on the surface
Til we flew out to my homeboy's wedding
When they exchanged vows, I knew I wasn't heading
To the same place with you, reality set in
I loved you but didn't like the feelings that you let in
Insecurity, jealousy, envy, no self-esteem
It's like I woke out of a bad dream
All the drinking and the smoking and the going out
Never mind all the shit I ain't know about
I had to free my future
Let go of your grip with Kama Sutra
Sleep alone and feel like I lost my world
My axis was spinning with you girl
The other day I heard my cell phone ring
An unknown caller calling in, hold up
The other day I heard my cell phone ring
An unknown caller calling in
I wish I could talk to you
