[Intro]
Nottz, let's take 'em back
Yes, yes, yes

[Verse 1]
Yes, the Smith 'n, the Wesson
Extended clip in the vest of whoever testin'
Rollin to the party with the shottie with the body
Made the lead put the slugs with the hollows in the heads
With the, with the-with the-with the Mossberg pump
When it thump make the nigga with the heart turn punk
Would ya-would ya-would ya would ya please leave me alone
So I can get my Chuck D on
Yes, the rhythm, the rebel
Public Enemy number one with heavy metal
If I don't got the whistle and my Air Nikes
I don't feel right out there livin' in my surreal life
All of you hoes should know I will blow that whistle
Blow a hole in your throw back and throw that pistol
Pimps, pussy and power, police, pitchers, hitters
The streets, religion, ballers, all of 'em getcha' getcha' if you don't

[Chorus]
Blow that whistle, blow that whistle
Blow that whistle, blow that whistle
Blow that whistle

[Verse 2]
Yes, we brothers of the same kind, un-blind
Yes, same mind duckin one-time, same nine
Yes, I aim fine what I bang gettin lain down
With after I give 'em hang time then it's game time
Yes, same gang nigga, young June, young Vishis
You punks better come wit it 'fore we come visit
Blastin them hammers - I ain't no punk
Wanna Punk me? You better bring Ashton and cameras
Heh.. would you blow that whistle?
At a ho that dissed you, or that clique crew
That you that'll stiff you, like a Kodak picture
Please don't depend on the short arms of the law
Naw, niggas be goin' crazy waitin' for they day
But me I know what time it is like Flava Flav, hey
Pimps, pussy and power, police, pitchers and hitters
The streets, religion, ballers, all of 'em getcha getcha if you don't

[Chorus]
Blow that whistle, blow that whistle
Blow that whistle, blow that whistle
Blow that whistle

[Verse 3]
Yes, niggas be lookin awfully hard to the car
Bein coughed out while I be Heimlich-ing off
The kind that'll knock the primer off the side of your car
The kind that'll bang the triangle off your garage
When it sound off, y'all'll be talkin to God
Cause y'all are soft inside, you had to be bossin' up
So I had to be bossin' you down, talkin' hard
'Til I blow you across the street like a crossing guard
Ha, I will blow that whistle
Leave your brains all over the ho that's with you
Leave you layin all over the flo' that's with you
Leave your name all over the flow that fits you
This is for you and whoever you sold that shit to
I'm the soldier with the fo'-fo' that hits you
Pimps, pussy and power, police, pitchers and hitters
The streets, religion, ballers, all of 'em getcha getcha if you don't

[Chorus]
Blow that whistle, blow that whistle
Blow that whistle, blow that whistle
Blow that whistle

[Verse 4]
