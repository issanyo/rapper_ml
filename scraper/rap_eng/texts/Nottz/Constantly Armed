[Chorus: 2pac]

Constantly armed, my firepower keep me warm
I'm trapped in the storm and fuck the world 'til I'm gone
And then it's on, before I leave, picture me
I'm spittin' at punk bitches and hustlin' to be free
Watch me set it, niggas don't want it, you can get it
Bet it make these jealous niggas mad I said it
This that heat nigga

[verse 1: Napoleon Da Legend]

Primadonna moniker Britannica philosopher
I’m shakra’ed peace to 2Pac my reach is popular
We lock it up 2018 we gon recycle em
You ain’t eating ya proper vitamins ya engine idling
Ya top 10 is garbage you might as well just writing em in
Rumors say that’s Po's polite you ain’t seen that side of em
Had to cut the toxic out Dennis Rodman box em out
Projects I knock em out give you something to talk about
Am I mumbling clearly enough for all dumb fucks?
Nun-chucks bash ya chest in and now ya lungs stuck
Gun butt early on the come up when the sun up
Run up on son that’s a make over you get done up
Remarkable king don’t argue a thing my armor big and I’m
Claiming what’s mine in the world like I’m a Obama’s kid
I'm not just saying it I promise it reload the bullets
Make sure the clip is full like mamas fridge

[Chorus: 2pac]

Constantly armed, my firepower keep me warm
I'm trapped in the storm and fuck the world 'til I'm gone
And then it's on, before I leave, picture me
I'm spittin' at punk bitches and hustlin' to be free
Watch me set it, niggas don't want it, you can get it
Bet it make these jealous niggas mad I said it

[verse 2: Napoleon Da Legend]

Titanic fly bandit make ya body die from damage
Eating fried salmon using weaknesses to my advantage
Wild manic make the crowd panic ya crew morale famished
Bomb ya car make ya Uber ride vanish
Sly manner like Gambit I shuffle decks nonetheless
My posse double X and yes thats a subtle threat
Paint my rebuttal red you bubble head
Got yourself a couple dreads now you
Think you can spar to ya sudden death?
This is gutter my bread and butter you know the leg
Can never sleep on my shit kid this is not a bed
I’m stand offish I don’t stand with the man in office
Motivated by the energy that makes planet orbit
Or abandoned orphan they tried but they can’t deport him
God my only engineer I can’t let a man record em
I’m like the transporter
This rap game is money hungry and you can’t afford her

[Chorus: 2pac]

Constantly armed, my firepower keep me warm
I'm trapped in the storm and fuck the world 'til I'm gone
And then it's on, before I leave, picture me
I'm spittin' at punk bitches and hustlin' to be free
Watch me set it, niggas don't want it, you can get it
Bet it make these jealous niggas mad I said it
