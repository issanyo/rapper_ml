[Intro: Sample]
"Guys—I'm saving her life and yours. Her presence makes us all vulnerable. I don't want you learning that inconvenient fact under fire
Master chief?
Seek life elsewhere!
Suck my—"

[Hook: Heather Victoria + Rapsody]
If you feel it, yeah, if you feel it, feel it
If you feel it, yeah

If you feel it, yeah, if you feel it (Nottz!), feel it
If you feel it (Yeah, yo), yeah

[Verse: Rapsody]
I skip on water, I skate on ice
So if hell froze over, then I'd still be nice
You got a vice for gambling life, lay down the dice
You find yourself hooked up to device, like, "Beep, beep," uh
That's a weak beat—you good for that
You got the rules of fame confused with the rules of rap
Squad—we like Autobots in Idlewild
The future looks amazin', our drive is crazy-wild, you crazy, child
Watch 'em bite our style like edible arrangements
It could rain mints, I'm still fresher than all of y'all
Linen out the dryer, we don't close pens
Still hangin' on every line I spit before ten
Origin, Morrison, you outside The Doors
Waitin' on the son, a daughter came, five foot, four
Five foot, three, whichever, what's a inch to yard?
The ruler's back, they all say the ruler is Rap
Many will nap, countin' sheep? I never did that
Leaders lead, followers trail—I never look back
When you this good, you never get lapped
Widen the gap like plus sizes—somewhere in the back
I'm too big for your britches, I ain't never been slapped
Got palms in my face, they like, "Where y'all at?"
A way more elegant spot where you can't wear caps
That's a metaphor; my level advanced
You class Afro-American McCants
You can't, uh, ya race ain't fair
It's like you started back there, boy, I'm way up here
And still faster, I could sneeze, beat you by a lightyear
It's nothin' to gear up, it's like police out here
'Cept I'm aimin' at the ones rockin' the same big gear
Rest of y'all no threat, like some fathers
Disappear when she crowned, boy, I'm like McGyver
You can't be trapped when ya mind like a driver's
Boy, I been woke for many, many, many mileage
You'll never be as fly as me no matter who ya stylist
Boy, this what style is
Baby, this what style is
Boy, this what style is
Baby, this what style is, open up your eyelids
I can see the envy like Badu's green iris, I do what I wanna
I'm borderline Madonna
The Queen of Pop-Pop, aimin' at these pop warners
Knock the helmet off your shoulders then I peel off like bananas
I keep it so real you could call me Marlanna
A dead poet, this my will of fortune, no Vanna
I see the game you playin', competition never honest
Got pressure on your back—why I never left the sauna
Hot flow, that's a'ight though, take it as a warnin'
Dearly beloved, we're gathered here this mornin'
Till death do us part, expect ya family some mournin'
The game ain't the same, and all of y'all like Lauren
With the last name foreign, actin' New-New for 'em
And I ain't Korean, but I know I been nailin' it
They feelin' all hurt, why you actin' all delicate?
You gotta problem with me, you should write to your delegates
I'm a Jedi—no emotion, now they call me Bill Belichick
But I ain't feelin' patriot—America racist
Talkin' 'bout hoods that America made, shit
Understand the truth when you hear it
And understand the booth is where we spit mo' mirrors—
Reflections of it all
Just keepin' it real with y'all—ya feel me?

[Hook: Heather Victoria]
If you feel it, yeah, if you feel it, feel it
If you feel it, yeah
