[Hook]
Everything straight folk? I'm good
You sure you aight homie? I'm good
What up Joe, yo? I'm good
I'm good

[Verse 1]
Drinkin' Marnier up in the back seat
Hope the feds free my nigga Max B
Got some mean girls, I'm a mathlete
With my low hands, still countin' bread from last week
(What up though?)
To my boys that's live on the back street
Can't imagine living off my plan b
Glad I wasn't Russian, Zangief
Still dreamin' of tan on a black beach

[Hook]
Everything is everything
I got a little bit of everything
I don't need anything
Said I don't need anything
Everything straight folk? I'm good
You sure you aight homie? I'm good
What up Joe, yo? I'm good
I'm good

[Verse 2]
Factz, Mickey, that's what they call me, that's what they call me
I've birthed so many things, take me to Maury
I let the beat ride, tell the driver please take me to the seaside
(Konichiwa)
Wifey looking plush while I'm in the cut
With a cup, countin' up, I don't do much
Roof in the trunk, put the luggage in the front
Polo cuff, let a brotha stunt

[Hook]
Everything is everything
I got a little bit of everything
I don't need anything
Said I don't need anything
Everything straight folk? I'm good
You sure you aight homie? I'm good
What up Joe, yo? I'm good
I'm good

[Verse 3]
God is good homie, God is good (God is good)
I had dreams of gettin' out the hood (out the hood)
Mama still tryna go to Hollywood (Hollywood)
Still fly, I get a lotta looks, H-Town sound all around
From the Boogie Down
You know where I'm found, yea I got the crown
Everything lookin' how it should, how it should
As for me and my drink, we good

[Hook]
Everything is everything
I got a little bit of everything
I don't need anything
Said I don't need anything
Everything straight folk? I'm good
You sure you aight homie? I'm good
What up Joe, yo? I'm good
I'm good
Everything straight folk? I'm good
You sure you aight homie? I'm good
What up Joe, yo? I'm good
I'm good
