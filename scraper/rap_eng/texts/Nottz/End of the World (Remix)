[Verse 1: Blu]
The highest realm, she never saw yellow submarines
And human beings from outer space, out of space, out of mind
Dotted line grinds, got 'em signing up for Columbine
Columbian white lines, ring around the rosie's, pocket full of homies
Only one god, sat up above all with the mastermind
Yo, she dreamt like digital data, autobiographic pixelated magic
Blowing kisses at her
From the last moon woke up to the gold sun
Put a gun in one hand, told him have a sweet life
One day we gonna live it like them summers that we never left
Pictures that we never took of bitches off that top shelf
Help me to the promised land, I promise you can have it
You can bag it like cotton for slaves, water for chocolates
Pilot my pivot, piss in a bucket
Kick our feet up as our children grow up nothing like us

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Blu]
If this is love, fuck it, I could be a god
If I'm a god watch me pull a heaven out a star
360 billion trillions miles away from home
I heard a heartbeat and decided I should make a song
Momma read a song tell my father I'mma see him where that grass gets
Greener than Seattle after storms, about to read my last poem
Hope you forget it, I told her that it's only one way
I took a million steps, must have read a million scripts
'Fore I picked the perfect role, churches, corporations
Slave wages, pretty hoes...
Whoever told the police he could take my life?
Take my brother's life! Fuck it, take my mother's life!
Take my land, take my manhood, my fucking rights! (Biiach!)
Then enforce the laws
Pray to God one day we gonna be free like the children in the king's dream
I remember being free on King street

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Nottz ]
They say, you stranded in the world
I just stated I'm road tripping, and ran out of gas
On the highway that's never ending, and exit ramps are limitless
Getting (?), the optical
Despite a road block (?), but still I keep it moving, and grooving
'Till god hit the power switch, out this bitch
Strike me down, turn me to some ash out this bitch
And maybe then, I catch wind, and blow away from this bitch
But even then, who gives a rat's ass? 'Cuz the world about to end
And lord knows I was the best man, i could of been
So please have mercy on me, and wash away my sins
And lord knows I was the best man, i could of been
So please have mercy on me, and wash away my sins
