[Hook]
(1-2-3-4-5-6-7-8)
Y'all been fronting
Without a ounce of thugging
You go against me? You too can count for nothing

[Verse 1]
I'm the king of the backpackers
This T-bone contact to any wack rapper
It's biometric how I wet ya
My dialect's an entire weapon, it's set to just fire reckless
BLAOW! Like (1-2) guns swoop
In the same booth the federales tryna run through
Like, like (3-4) we raw
Me and Vish' trade like a triple beam seesaw
I'm a veteran, the Mac-11 the pump
You could name whoever you want
Wayne, Ye, Jay (Haha, I'm just playing with y'all)
I keep the (4-5) on my hip
You take me serious then I might trip
About (7-8) niggas and die
Feeling some type of way, I figure it's pride
I'm the right-on truth
And that's right, I'm even plotting on my own crew
Joey, Crooked, Or-tez, Slaughterhouse!

[Chorus]
(1-2-3-4-5-6-7-8)
Y'all been fronting
Without a ounce of thugging
You go against me? You too can count for nothing
Like (1, 2) like (3) like
You (2) can count for nothing

[Verse 2]
I'm what choice is to option
Royce to hip hop is what Mike Buffer's voice to boxing
Yes, it's a couple dope dealers somewhere
That got rich living the shit that I spit (Me!)
I don't re-enact nigga, I illuminate
I know every point what I account like a Q&A
It ain't a arm when it's tucked in my box
It's Lindsay Lohan, niggas call me Fire Crotch
I'm seeing clear like a MyBot
I drop my coupe, black shoes, black Noob Saibot
I spit fire like Izod, why not?
'Cause Sho'nuff, I'm glowing like Taimak
And y'all crying like babies over the net
I should call you niggas Lady Gaga
Or call, "You and Em need to get together
Y'all need each other Nickel, Shady, blah-blah!"
If I die I'ma leave heat
I'mma leave the sun behind, I'm tryna repeat
Don't try to ban the drummer
He's an animal and you can be a random number, uh

[Chorus]
(1-2-3-4-5-6-7-8)
Y'all been fronting
Without a ounce of thugging
You go against me? You too can count for nothing
Like (1, 2) like (3) like
You (2) can count for nothing

[Verse 3]
I put the gun to lames
Eeny-miny-Motown, play the numbers game
Five shots on my block
Is like for once, I see, like my pops is Cyclops
With both eyes, I see you got no sides
Bring it to your Chippendale neck with the bowties
Call you "Stan"
Grab a bitch ass like "aye!", call me OJ Da Juiceman
I get away with murder
That Johnny Rocket in my pocket with my favorite burger
I'm tryna shake it like a Polaroid
They said I couldn't do it twice, call me Soulja Boy

[Chorus]
(1-2-3-4-5-6-7-8)
Y'all been fronting
Without a ounce of thugging
You go against me? You too can count for nothing
Like (1, 2) like (3) like
You (2) can count for nothing
