[Verse 1]
I'm better as a man and it's all because of you baby
And now I understand when they say 'Behind a strong man there's you'
Some can't comprehend the words i speak on track 10 baby
But there's a new meaning for the truth
If the truth is in a pudding, you tell the pops on Cosby
If the truth is bare naked, then the truth, it look good on you
Sympathy baby, we make it do what it do
And that's a few reasons why I'm with you

[Chorus]
I'm so glad you're mine, you're mine
On a scale 1 to 10, you're about a couple of dimes
Head toe, you're so fine, so defined
A few reasons why you're mine

I'm so glad you're mine, so defined
On a scale 1 to 10, you're about a couple of dimes
Head toe, you're so fine, you're mine
A few reasons why you're mine

[Verse 2]
This song is my ode to you, for the twice time baby
I learned a few things since the last time I told you the truth
Got me outside with no umbrella and it's rainin
But I don't mind your wetness, it's cool
If we had computer love, I would let you hack my myspace
If your love was a dance, you could youtube me and watch me
You, you, you, you bring out the youth in an old soul baby
And that's a few reasons why I'm with you

[Chorus]
I'm so glad you're mine, so defined
On a scale 1 to 10, you're about a couple of dimes
Head toe you're so fine, so fine
A few reasons why you're mine

I'm so glad you're mine, my define
On a scale 1 to 10, you're about a couple of dimes
Head toe, you're so fine, so defined
A few reasons why you're mine

[Verse 3]
It's true you got me trying to find things about you to not be so wrapped up in you
But obvi-ously it's hopeless, that's why I wrote this
I can't help but to focus on your ass, your smile, your eyes
Just gotta keep it truthful with myself cause in the end
I'ma want you for more than a friend
If you ain't heard me, I'ma say it again

[Chorus]
I'm so, I'm so glad you're mine, you're mine
On a scale 1 to 10, you're about a couple of dimes
Head toe, you're so fine, so fine
A few reasons why you're mine, you're mine

I'm so glad you're mine, so glad
On a scale 1 to 10, you're about a couple of dimes
Head toe, you're so fine, so fine
A few reasons why you're mine

Oh, ah, ah, ah, so glad
Oh, ah, ah, ah, you're mine
Oh, ah, ah, ah, oooh
Oh, ah, ah, ah, oooh
Oh, ah, ah, ah, you're mine
