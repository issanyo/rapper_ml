[Chorus]
Our lungs are meant for water, sorrow calls for laughter
Flip the page brother this another chapter of our life...that's right
So what better way to go 'bout it than to live it right?
It is what it is but take the wrongs turn 'em right
You see adversity like wind to my kite
Impossible to venture further with our story
If we stuck with memories of shame and moments of glory
'nough doubtin' I'ma live my life
Followin' the heart and instinct fuck the hype oh...
Fuck the hype oh...
Follow heart oh...

[First Verse]
I've come across a new perspective of pain
And ever since I see what I can lose not what's to be gained
It's not what I want but what I don't need
And when I cut the unnecessaries I feel more free
Than a slave who just killed his master
Life ain't a bastard it's whatever we make of it
Perception determines who dies or thrives
Like when life beats you up and folds you over what do you see?
I see an omelet shit
My humor may be facetious but sincerely
All jokes aside reality's what we perceive it to be
Lighten up bro, this seriousness will only pull you down further
Drag you back, doesn't heal but will murder
Funny how when we try to hold pain back on the track is when it's lappin'
But when we dance with it it cries for our wings to be flappin'
Life is life whatever happens happens
Best we can do is to flow and get adaptin'

[Chorus]

[Second Verse]
Pain can be a friend or it can be a bitch
A buddy that lets you know when something's wrong or when to scratch what's itched
Or an asshole who hits-and-runs leavin' victims in the ditch
Always wanna talk when you want none of it
Yin and Yang is who Pain plays in all our movies
Whether we like it or not it fulfills its duties
This is heavy duty but take it loosely
Cause narrow vision affects anyone maroosely
This how I feel about it it's all love & deuce
Any form it comes in I take it and juice
Like, what's the point of knowledge if you can't put it to use
Like, what's the point in havin' choices if you can't choose right?
C'mon confront the issue right then and there
If you can't do it now and here will never do it anywhere
And that's real, only truth I spit
And that sometimes is more powerful than when pain hits

[Chorus]
