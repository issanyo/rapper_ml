[Intro]
Our Father who art in Heaven
Hallows be in our frame
Thy kingdom come, thine will be done
On Earth, but it feels like Hell
Give us this day our daily bread
Cause niggas is trespassing
I pray for the souls that trespass against us
And lead us not into temptation
But deliver us from us
Amen

[Verse 1]
I was taught that misery loves company
Comfortably I would sit in the company
Of some friends and luckily
I began to see the shift in they feelings
Niggas become dependent
Dependin’ what you provide the hero becomes the villain
Sometimes they don’t wanna see you progress
They feelin’ low, they head up callin’ you “Your Highness”
But see that shit is for the birds like a high nest
And since I’m sick of making sense about your nonsense
What a simple complex, they wonderin’ why I’m stressed
I’m worried about my cousin’s kids watching him whip
Working a Pyrex pot, they stopped them dressin’ up as pirates
They innocence is lost like it’s stranded on an island
No treasure and the weather bad surrounded by the sirens
It’s soundin’ so loud, solution drownin’ in the silence, it’s deafening
Definitely definite, shadows that you be steppin’ in
Dance with the Devil, I hope you had you some lessons then
Guess I be exitin’, they said I was heaven-sent
Said I was down to Earth, I’m like where the fuck the hell you been?
Couldn’t be where I stay cause Englewood is crazy man
Duck when the weapons spray, duckin’ like every day
Shootin’ and they rarely aim, mama’s feeling hella pain
Round here we lose dogs, ironic cause they catchin’ strays

[Bridge]
Somebody pray for ‘em
Somebody pray for ‘em, pray for 'em
Somebody pray for ‘em, pray for 'em
Somebody pray for ‘em
Cause you lookin’ like prey for ‘em

[Verse 2]
Yo, I preach life to my niggas
Try to show them right so I don’t write to my niggas
Blinded by ambition, this shit is sight to my niggas
Aside from Lisa Bonet you ain’t seen you a brighter nigga
So smart, it’s hard for white folks, they study me
They scared I’m pro-Black so they try to buddy-buddy me
My playback is payback for those who in front on me
Tellin’ Father Time there ain’t no son in me
Wantin’ me to swish like a pitcher I be strikin’ every time
But when I say I don’t play these niggas press rewind
I finna [?] the beat like this shit is all mine
I never been a bum so I never need a sign
From the Lord, the moment that I swore
How could we ever starve when there’s more for us in store?
Of course I put this wack rap on clearance rack, it gotta go
I’m tryna bring that feelin’ back, with every flow
I make foes fold quicker than clean clothes
God made man from clay so I’m guessin’ I broke the mold
I’m ahead of my time without skippin’ a time zone
You can’t stop God, that’s one thing that I know boy

[Bridge]
Somebody pray for ‘em
Somebody pray for ‘em, pray for 'em
Somebody pray for ‘em, pray for 'em
Somebody pray for ‘em
Cause you lookin’ like prey for ‘em
Yo
