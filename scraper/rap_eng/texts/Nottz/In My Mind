[Sample]:
I have found my own Utopia in you (yea)
I wish the world could share the dream I’m drifting through (drifting through)
A man could search his life away and never find (never find)
The warm serenity, in my heart and in my mind

[Verse 1: Nottz Raw]:
Yea, come on a roll with me
Through the state of hip-hop, be on patrol with me
Not a single red stop throughout the whole city
Nigga if you with me, just don’t piss on my car
I’m by far a trap star, but dude I’m damn near to it
I cook crack for rap stars, I’m bred to do it
Nottz Raw speak this hip-hop shit so damn fluent
I shit out drums and wipe my ass with sheet music
I chop off thumbs of those hitchhiking my bass line
Slick motherfuckers should be charged for rape crimes
Sucking the game dry, like vampires
Suckas messin' up the game, where's the empire
You just a pawn motherfucker, just call me sire
Its real hip-hop here, I’m what the streets desire
This here grown folk music minus the heart bottoms
Tell my Nottz Raw fans across the world I got 'em (I got ‘em)

[Sample]:
I have found my own Utopia in you
(I’m talking bout [hip-hop])
I wish the world could share the dream I’m drifting through
(See in my world [hip-hop])
A man could search his life away and never find
(See, I eat, sleep and breathe [hip-hop])
The warm serenity, in my heart and in my mind

[Verse 2: Nottz Raw]:
Yea, you know, sometimes (sometimes)
I wanna jump back and kiss myself
But my Fam keep me grounded cause nobody else would
Hateful motherfuckers always up to that no good
Shit, don’t wanna see you shine, don’t wanna see you have things
So I try to maintain composure, they want to see that bad guy
But every so often I’m often a slice of the devils pie
Real music and Emmy’s so motherfucker why try
Dude you ain't never like my shit, so why lie
Try to give me words of enlightenment, I don’t need ‘em
In this land of hip-hop there’s rules we abide by
But, you, motherfuckers, who, act like you don’t need ‘em
I inspire me, while you provoke the
Demon inside of me to go ape shit on he
He who make that bullshit, stop it
Tell my Nottz Raw fans across the world I got ‘em (I got ‘em)
