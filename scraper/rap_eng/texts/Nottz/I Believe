[Intro: ?? ]
So Disappointed
We all disappointed
All disappointed

[Verse 1 : T.I.]
Aiight
Now I believe in a lot of things
Believe karma real, Believe Allah King
Believe the bible is re-written, preacher be bullshiting
So when they speak believe not a thing

Believe M-L-King had a dream for real
He in Heaven, and we be dealing with demons still
Like an episode of Pinky and the brain for real
Wanna run the world & rule errthing for real

Well god damn (Hol' Up Hol' Up)

Whatchu think will happen when you die ma man,(Die ma man)
Even better whatchu gon do when they push you in the fire ma man

Well I'm a sinner (true) but not like you
I ain't been malicious in the shit I do
Well, I might smoke a  blunt or two (ugh)
Ménage every month or two
Sell I dope to get some money, shit I wanna do law
But I can't go to school, I ain't go the money to
Rather give me fifty years than a scholarship
Anything to keep me outta politics
I believe politicians pull a lot of tricks
The war on drugs crack epidemic, all a 'dat
The death of Bob Marley & Malcom X
Pac and Biggie too , but I ain't really sure about dat

Believe Jesus, die for my sins, don't need no fake image for me to hide behind man
The KKK and the USA got a thang like Superman got for Lois Lane

Uncle Sam lift a lady just address Us
Grabbing on the pussy yelling "shawty that thang"

Now be clear, I ain't tryna this ain't no black thang or white thang
It's a dead wrong and right thang

Believe white supremacy , think i'ont see it
Everything they tryna bring down on me
Like the stop and frisk, mass incarceration that perpetuation of recidivism
That mean they create a system hard to break
That's why millions still behind bars today
Columbus day you believe a holiday
What about Capone and Doc Holiday
Lucky Luciano, John Gotti day
Bumpy Johnson and Larry Hoover day
Happy Meech day, Happy Tookie day
Happy Hitler day, sounds stupid aye?
That’s cause hypocrisy more American than democracy
Far as I can see the Constitution wasn't for folk that look like me and that’s what I believe!

[Chorus ?? (T.I.) ]
Wanna be better but you down at the moment
Give dat shit to God it'll  be better in the morning
Still think your skin make you  way more important
Naaaaahh (Hol' up)
All this money but you still can't afford me
Gotta sell your soul just to end up on the Forbes list
Leader of the generation, I'ma get us all in
Aaaaahhh

[Verse 2: T.I.]
All your plans ain't worth for damn
Cause in front of God, you are just a man
Wanna take advantage of a lesser man
Build a wall, keeping out the Mexicans
Go to Standing Rock and wanna poison water, just like Michigan
Now ain't this a bitch
If I learned anything, I've seen any bitch can be president (Hold up)
I say that nigga hostile, get the yellow flare in they nostril (Hold up)
God never said weapons wouldn't form, he just said they wouldn't prosper

[Outro: ?? (T.I)]
Stand for your people , ya
Stand with your brother, its time with your sister, ya
Stand for your people, ya
We can't give another fuck
Message to Americaaaaa
So Disappointing, we all disappointed
Bout to do some more play, Oh u want that OA?
How you doing numbers very similar to my case
Neighborhood like a battlefield , we are not safe
(I believe we are not safe, I believe we are not safe)
(I belive dat what I believe dat what I believe we are not safe)
(I believe we are not safe)
(I believe dat what I believe we are not safe, dat what i believe, dat what i believe, eyy)
