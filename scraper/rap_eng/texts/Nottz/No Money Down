[Intro]
Uh-huh
With No Money Down
Listen

[Verse 1: Nottz]
I walk barefoot 'round the world for you
Hot-step on lava rock from volcanoes
My boys think I'm insane though
The way I jump out of planes with no parachute
I do it for you
To tell you the truth boo
With no money down
I'd jump off a bridge, baby to fuck up around
Dog I'd paddle in an alligator pit with a pound
Of pork chops hangin' from my nuts
I'm tellin' you now
I'd run in a bear cave with no flashlight
And steal their porridge just to feed your appetite
And baby your man here is somewhat dynamite
And not Jimmy Walker, but the kind you 'bout to light
With no money down, I'd scale the Empire State and skydive down
So you could see the message in my parachute as I float down
Baby, why everyone thinkin' I'm crazy?

[Hook: Terese Cook and Nottz]
But I ain't crazy though
It's just I love my baby just a bit more
Do anything in this world for my baby though

With No Money Down
I'd give my baby the world
With No Money Down
Uh-huh
You don't need a lay-a-way plan
I got your back babygirl just as long as you stand
Right beside your man baby, holdin' it down
With No Money Down
I give you the crown

[Verse 2: Nottz]
I'd go diving in shark infested waters babygirl
Just to get you them pearls
With No Money Down
I'd wrestle a polar bear for its fur
Baby if you're cold out there
Them boys out there really don't know what love is about
Hit Cupid up, he wanted me to ride shotgun
But I told him "Nah, dog I can't do it today, cuz my baby wants a giraffe, a lion, and a bear."
Struttin' through the jungle with nothin' but kickin' ass on my mind
With No Money Down
I do what it take, girl
You can't see
I'd give you my eyes
Who would dive thirty-thousand feet to bring you some whale meat?
Yeah, me baby
With no money down, I'd scale the Empire State and skydive down
So you could see the message in my parachute as I float down
Baby, why everyone thinkin' I'm crazy?

[Hook] x2

[Outro: Nottz]
Things that I do for my baby
Got everybody around me thinkin' I'm crazy
But I'm far from crazy for my baby
I'd do anything

With No money down
Yeah
