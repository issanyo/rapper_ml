[Intro]
That feeling
That feeling

[Verse 1]
Woke up from a nightmare
Twice before the sun rose
Every time I write it's laundry day the way it unfolds
Pieced up, sneaking through a crowd
That's when he unload on innocence
Hole in heart bigger than Pun clothes
Living with a different calling
Police at front doors
Banging more than colors
Rainbows, can't jump those
Wish that I could talk to Rosa
Maybe have some blunts rolled
She could tell me how it really feel to sit in front rows
Made from a different cloth
Why we need to stunt clothes?
Last time he seen his daughter she was just a month old
I feel for 'Tone, probably why I'm scared to have my own
Family only matter, when the television's on
It's hella kids grown, childhood abandonment
News tell us anything, never been a fan of it
I don't sell dope but everyone around me does
Hardly wear red but everyone around me blood, huh
Talking to a youngster on the street
Asking for a couple dollars just so he can eat
I probably would've gave him some if I had it
I mean, I got a 20 on me, but I need it for my habit
The rabbit try to run game, especially on a tortoise
Layaway, mama-way, just say she can't afford this
2:28 she still thankful what the stork sent
Try to see but they don't, Mr. walk-and-talk it
Need a pick-me-up, Long Island or a forklift
Life a game, devil tryna convince me to forfeit

[Bridge]
Yeah
Yeah
Yeah
Peep It, Ay

[Verse 2]
Was in a lodge for weeks
Had a dream Martin hit the weed, hit the podium, and then forgot his speech
Ain't talking Houston when I say I'm where the rockets reach
Walking 'round with my chest out like it's a topless beach
Thoughts in my head I do not release
When they finally get it they listen like when Obama speak
You know its bad to turn your work in when it's not complete
That's how I see you niggas, weak as fuck, why compete?
Let me rock this beat easier than college freaks
Use to run through lifestyles I was Robin Leach
Said they kings, nigga sold his only Polynice
Was turf dancing in Steve Madden's and Wallaby's
I took it back with that, free Jack, I heard he home
Got that [?] Watson flesh with some birdie bones
In any hood I'm Jim Boheim, I'm learning zone
I'm going in like I got pulled over with dirty chrome
I had curve and chrome, coke had me drinking Goose
Will bout as high as an alley that I was throwing duece
In high school I needed [?] suit and long chain
Eastmont ain't been the same since the mall changed
That's a random fact but fuck it, let me vent a few
Only time a good year for you is when a blimp done flew
So high I'm driving with my hands at 10 and 2
Money in the ceiling, my bad I had to win for loot
Ya dig?
