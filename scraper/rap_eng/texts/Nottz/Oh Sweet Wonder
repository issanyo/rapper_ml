[Verse One]
Yo, every morning I wake, gotta give God the glory
If there's no testing there's no testimony
Oh sweet wonder, shake 'em out of they slumber
And when I brain storm you hear the clap of the thunder
Waiting to strike at the perfect time
I sit down then I ponder the perfect rhyme
Look we over shine, that's our only mission
And niggas trying to count us out they New Edition/addition
But I'ma spread my wings cause I'm a trooper
Your rap do sound the same, [?]
Same record spinning, the start of y'all ending
He on that Charlie Sheen cause they swear that they winning
Guess I'm a loser and abuser of the alphabet
My niggas smoke it Red like Minister Malcolm X
Sinister architect
Been in the monument
Then burning the documents so rappers can't copy this
Xerox
Like it bump, no Clorox
When I rush your spot don't be surprised like [?]
Strong as an ox, brain sly as a fizzox
One man gang and let this bang on your blizzox

[?]
The language I got be slanging a lot
The chain that I rock hang low like your pop
My watch shines Supreme, Diana Ross
Sick from a glimpse you need you need a Mylanta shot
Got gigantic spark, light got a gleam in it
Disco ball, Lupe Fiasco Beamin
Drinking till I'm leaning, Promethazining
Do the dirty then put it in the throat for cleaning
Yep, I'm the Top G, Tom Cruise
Tropic Thunder, out storming on dudes

[?]
Ayo the bullshit walk, I'ma let the cash talk
Stay out of sight keep my ear to the asphalt
Baby getting crunk so she ask can I spend mo'
Ain't from New Orleans but the answer is N.O
I thank God I'm still breathing, still eating
I'm on my grown man shit homie
You baby niggas still teething
Fix your face before the Wolves come fix a plate
We the big fish, y'all niggas just fish bait

[?]
Alright, you're pissing me off like bad kidneys
I'm from a Different World like Dwayne Wade and Whitley
I mean really you don't want no drama
My money longer than beards on Osama
Period, comma, whatever you ain't stopping me
From keeping my paper up like a pasta feast
Don't mean a thang if it ain't got that bang
Hate to break the news to you but you still can't hang

[Nottz]
I ain't gonna tell you mahfuckas again
Fuck writing words, I'd rather stab you with that pen
Depending on the mood I'm in
It reflect on the stroke of the pen for this murder
Respect me, not a 'nawl nigga, it's unheard of
Classic case of the basket
Time to take you fuckers back to the basics
Grinding in my Asics gel and say "Aye B
You sick with bars minus the jail."
Got 'em [?]
The shit he just [?] imagine the smell
Drinking from my half empty cup the Holy Grail
The last supper fucker eat it well
You may be excused, this here food for dudes that paid dues
Bunch of hungry ass niggas in Training like Denzel
Real rapping shit
That boom baptastic trip to get the money
Nope not Chappel
Never turning down the green or your train will derail
Your life shoot to shit and from there turn to Hell
Get the money mayne
