[Intro: Scarface]
Yeah
What do you mean, "Where am I at?"
Tss, I'ma call you back

[Hook: Trey Songz]
No you can't be my girlfriend
'Cause I don't need that stress up in my life and
No you can't be my girlfriend

[Verse 1: Scarface]
I think if Adam would of had another squeeze he might
Not have ate those fruits from the leaves of life
Far as Eve, there couldn't have been a more deceivin' wife
Seen that Adam had a weak spot and she was right
I just call it how I see it, she in love with him
And he in love too, but still fuckin' all of them
Can you imagine you on lock with one breeze for life?
Wakin' up in the mornin' and layin' down at night
With the same face lookin' at you all the time
Realizin' now that happiness was hard to find
You wanna go out and try to find that smile and face
Plus she's always mad and her sex ain't great
And she don't suck dick like she used to do
Force a nigga into tryna find him somethin' new
And on the real, I done seen it when it went like this
But girl, there's one thing happenin' that you can't forget

[Hook: Trey Songz]
No you can't be my girlfriend
'Cause I don't need that stress up in my world and
No you can't be my girlfriend
And we can get it on and on and on
I'm gone when the sun come again
Can't be my girlfriend
You can't be my, you can't be my

[Verse 2: Scarface]
But you can never be my main boo, we can remain cool
But we can't be seen and for this I can blame you
Because you got more miles than a F-350
You been ran through and I know for a fact you got history
But since we met, I've been hearin' your name in certain circles
Pussy got a snap like a turtle
And you can catch a nigga on the late night
Comin' out the club, half drunk off Remy and Sprite
And make a man out of him quick 'cause of how you handle the dick
It's unlike no other, she a bad motherfucker
But I'm too strong to let a hoe undercover
Make me look fucked up 'cause unlike those others
I done met a lot of freaky girls in my lifespan
So you can't get mad 'cause I am not your man
Your understandin' was bad, it was not my plan
For you to fall in love with me, girl it's not like that

[Hook: Trey Songz]
No you can't be my girlfriend
'Cause I don't need that stress up in my world and
No you can't be my girlfriend
And we can get it on and on and on
I'm gone when the sun come again
Can't be my girlfriend
You can't be my, you can't be my

[Verse 3: Scarface]
For me to say that, "I do," would be a lie 'cause I don't
Believe no woman is right for me so I won't
Try to talk myself into thinkin' she is
And if she leaves me for this, that's just one less bitch
And trust me, I tried to be a one woman man
But for every one woman, there's a man, home man
Sayin', "Damn, I done spent six years in this shit
The first two was cool and then the bitch just flipped"
And then that's it, had to make some new plans
'Cause your brand new woman got a brand new man
Now you're hurt all alone, steady hittin' her phone
But a bigger whip and longer bankroll, she gone
And if I ever say, "Maybe," and you thought that I might
You consider, just imagine what my wife was like
And if you ain't love my kids like you loved your own
And me unconditionally when I was wrong, I was gone

[Hook: Trey Songz]
No you can't be my girlfriend
'Cause I don't need that stress up in my world and
No you can't be my girlfriend
And we can get it on and on and on
I'm gone when the sun come again
Can't be my girlfriend
You can't be my, you can't be my girl

[Hook: Trey Songz]
Sorry baby
