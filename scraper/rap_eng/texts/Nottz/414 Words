It's Mickey!

[Verse 1]
A couple of words for the ears of the listeners
You're here as a visitor, please leave your signature
Diary of Mickey on display it's a yearbook
Privacy is really a decay, I'm a werewolf
Alive in the night, 4:14 on my clock as I write
Bills on my countertop rocking my life
Bill collectors plotting calling non-stop got me tight
They blocked outta spite
Credit score growing, bank account got a comma now for the moment
Health Insurance got a brother zoning
Misery in life is history, crazy how a number with two fours just got a trilogy
America about to vote Trump instead of Hillary
What happened to the dignity, somebody gotta tell me before I have me a mini-me
And be a faja, like Mike Myers minus being the monster
Sitting on a chase sippin' OJ and vodka, Americana sponsored
People creepin' in my inbox like they Contra
Listen to my song please, little do they know I do the same thing with Don C
Difference is the angle, we ain't speak since April, 2014
There go that number again, it's still haunting me
Deja vu, but I won't let it conquer me
People know the name, but it so hard to market me
Hurting every vein, my brain and all my arteries
The black Sean Connery, Y-3 honorary member as a nominee
Came a long way from my lawyer dreams
All it means, is a couple hundred words can change a man's outlook
Go from unemployed to dreamin' 'bout how the house look
Concrete floors got it looking like a loft
20-13 man I couldn't buy a Voss
Two years later now I'm looking like a boss and the dealership sayin', "I look good inside a Porsche"
Two seater, a few visas, new Caesar, ruler and haircut, true leader
I got 'em sick to they stomach, now that's a flu fever
Going over my words they all proof readers
Lesson learned without a school teacher
Payin' Paul before I knew Peter
Expressionism scribes for my supporters
I'm hoping the letters hit 'em, prayin' Loretta feel 'em
Lauren getting older I'm hoping to give her wisdom
She better listen, blank canvas on a wall, my television
It's knots in my heart, these words are in the prison
Reflecting prism
I had 4.14 in my bank account
Same time in the morning I had to think it out
Same number with words I used to paint it out
414, 414
