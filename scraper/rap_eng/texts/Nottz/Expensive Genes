[Intro]
Alright we need to check your height. Uh-huh. Ok
Let me get your weight. Ok. Uh-uh
Ha, I think we can do a little bit better than that. We'll talk. Ok?
Your cholesterol is looking kinda high but, ah we're going to work on that. Ah, let's take your blood pressure
Are you in any pain?

[Verse]
Seven days in a week
Eat a steak every plate, it's a feast
Watch your weight, no mistakes in the least
Or else you too will dig a grave with your teeth
I wish I that I could fit in these expensive genes
A waistline that'll rip the seams
And pharmaceuticals that sit between ya heart medicine
Cough medicine, blood thinners and antihistamines
We got the ocean front view but scope is so limited
'Cause young niggas be dyin' of old nigga shit
Wifey sleepin' in the guest room 'cause you snore at night
It’s like 40 years old is 3/4 life
Our biggest fears were shots or armed robbery
Now the biggest fears are clots and oncology
Got a sleep app to tell you you got sleep apnea
He all in your sheets with a CPAP
Wish that I could fit in these expensive genes
I don’t like this cut, it’s like the Lord got my order wrong
3am, stress eating, laying down on it
Now ya blood sugar is borderline Bordelon
Seen 'em rise, I seen 'em fall
I’ve seen the dreams of fiends and scenes of war
Inside my mind, it ain’t nothin' serene, it’s called Blackness
The most expensive gene of all

[Outro]
Ok, I see. I see. Alright, uh
We need to good look at your family history
Yes, your family history. I know it may be a little difficult
