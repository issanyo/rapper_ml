[Verse 1]
I'm 24 with a pocket full of dreams
My Kings of the Bronx mixtape is on the scene
Hoping that Pharrell sign a nigga to the team
In Search of the N.E.R.D., yo Steve
I wanna be on Star Trek
Working at a law firm, 20k a year that's before tax
Living at my momma house, crawled back
Middle of the 2nd term for Bush and I thought that
I was gon' be all that
Mama said "Boy, go to school" and I'm not one to talk back
So I said cool, soon as fall back
Fall came, fall leftâ€¦ Figured I would fall back
NYU I was there with my ball cap
Dropped out, mama kicked me out
Now I'm going house to house, my new bed is a couch
Or the floor mat
Now I'm 25, no money to my name
Looking like a lame in the mirror saying "where the coins at?"

[Hook]
I gotta get it, gotta, gotta get it, I gotta get it
Gotta get it, get it, get it, get it, I gotta get it
All the money, money, money, money, I gotta get it
Gotta get it, gotta, gotta get it, I gotta get it
Gotta get it, gotta, gotta get it, I gotta get it
Gotta get it, get it, get it, get it, I gotta get it
All the money, money, money, money, I gotta get it
Gotta get it, gotta, gotta get it, I gotta get it

[Verse 2]
Ay I got it popping
Took a trip to Boston, on the roll rocking
Guggenheim
P-p-p-posers couldn't stop it
Didn't have a meal some nights but my clothes was the hottest
I was down at Sway every monday
Melo X DJ'ing, yo, what up Saint?
I got free drinks and I was hungry
Spokesman for the streetwear runway
One day
Had to make a choice at the fork of the road
Go one way or be a bum mayne
Shit.. I'm in the pursuit of happiness
Heavens Fallout, now I'm arrogant, Lazarus
Tryna rise up so immaculate
God don't like ugly, Craig Mack-ing it
Automatic cover of a magazine
Mama saying know I ain't believe
But my friends see you on they TV, no degree
Look at me

[Hook]
I gotta get it, gotta, gotta get it, I gotta get it
Gotta get it, get it, get it, get it, I gotta get it
All the money, money, money, money, I gotta get it
Gotta get it, gotta, gotta get it, I gotta get it
Gotta get it, gotta, gotta get it, I gotta get it
Gotta get it, get it, get it, get it, I gotta get it
All the money, money, money, money, I gotta get it
Gotta get it, gotta, gotta get it, I gotta get it

[Bridge]
Rockin' and a rollin', rollin' and a rockin'
Poppin' when I go in, go in and it's poppin'
I got a feeling that it's, that it's automatic
I got a feeling that it's, that it's automatic
Ask anybody you know, I'm incredible
Ask anybody you see, I'm incredible
You could even ask your momma, I'm incredible
Go ahead, ask Obama, I'm incredible

[Hook]
I gotta get it, gotta, gotta get it, I gotta get it
Gotta get it, get it, get it, get it, I gotta get it
All the money, money, money, money, I gotta get it
Gotta get it, gotta, gotta get it, I gotta get it
Gotta get it, gotta, gotta get it, I gotta get it
Gotta get it, get it, get it, get it, I gotta get it
All the money, money, money, money, I gotta get it
Gotta get it, gotta, gotta get it, I gotta get it
