[Chorus: Sheek Louch]
D-Blockkkkkk
We made it from the bottom to the top
We ain't have a pot to piss in
These fuckin' record labels we was beggin' em to (listen)
Now our watch glisten
These new A&Rs take the artist in the room and play our shit like (listen, Lox!)
Drug dealers, stick up kids, niggas on a mission (yeah)
You outta towner niggas is welcome here but (now listen)
Dope money, coke money, cookin' in the kitchen
L-O-X, D-Block (now listen), hip-hop (now listen)

[Verse 1: Styles P]
Now, I was hopin' that you would listen to me
Gotta a buncha niggas that'll make you gettin' missin' for me
You don't know the clique, you wasn't doin' your history
Call me The Ghost, I'm the nigga like an epiphany
Down in the minivan, three jack boys, two murderers
My niggas gon' get busy on any lane
If you the king, then you soon to die
A new king [?] rules in Junior High
[?] Maroon 5 gettin' booed [?]
You a goon, you make sure that the shooter die
Niggas get fresh but I get Rick-the-Ruler fly
Guns so automatic niggas thought it was computerized

[Chorus: Sheek Louch]
We made it from the bottom to the top
We ain't have a pot to piss in
These fuckin' record labels we was beggin' em to (listen)
Now our watch glisten
These new A&Rs take the artist in the room and play our shit like (listen, Lox!)
Drug dealers, stick up kids, niggas on a mission (yeah)
You outta towner niggas is welcome here but (now listen)
Dope money, coke money, cookin' in the kitchen
L-O-X, D-Block (now listen), hip-hop (now listen)

[Verse 2: Jadakiss]
This [?] take a few years to come out, gun out, dumb out
Now listen, that's why you got two ears and one mouth
Road to the riches, I only know one route (that's it)
There's land on the property and that ain't no fun house
Usually respect is earned, not given
You losin' 'cause you ain't concerned about winnin'
Question is when will you learn you not livin'?
Hopefully you'll get your turn just stop bitchin' (stop)
Watched what not to do then we became bosses
The loudest niggas usually the brokest or the softest
Yeah, most loyal, if nothing, we are that
I hug my niggas tight and I give 'em a hun' wrap [?]
What up?

[Chorus: Sheek Louch]
We made it from the bottom to the top
We ain't have a pot to piss in
These fuckin' record labels we was beggin' em to (listen)
Now our watch glisten
These new A&Rs take the artist in the room and play our shit like (listen, Lox!)
Drug dealers, stick up kids, niggas on a mission (yeah)
You outta towner niggas is welcome here but (now listen)
Dope money, coke money, cookin' in the kitchen
L-O-X, D-Block (now listen), hip-hop (now listen)

[Verse 3: Sheek Louch]
The project building, the crackheads, the news, the killins
The stick-up kids, these little niggas dreamin' of millions
The dope rapper, the next Jordan, the little young bitch that got a fake ass to fill a porn (damn)
The bakin' soda, the triple beam, the dope fiends
The boosted bitch, the fake checks, the credit schemes
The court system. the jail time, the crooked shit
Police is huntin' black people from the look of it
The big rocks, the Range Rover, the emptiness
Your one hit went in and out like P and Kiss (uh)
The longevity, the street cred, you'll never get
You're a student of this L-O-X shit

[Chorus: Sheek Louch]
We made it from the bottom to the top
We ain't have a pot to piss in
These fuckin' record labels we was beggin' em to (listen)
Now our watch glisten
These new A&Rs take the artist in the room and play our shit like (listen, Lox!)
Drug dealers, stick up kids, niggas on a mission (yeah)
You outta towner niggas is welcome here but (now listen)
Dope money, coke money, cookin' in the kitchen
L-O-X, D-Block, hip-hop (now listen)

[Outro: Sheek Louch]
L-O-X, L-O-X, L-L-O-X, D-Block, hip-hop, now listen
L-O-X, L-O-X, L-L-O-X, D-Block, hip-hop, now listen
(Now listen, now listen, now listen, now listen)
L-O-X (now listen)
(Now-now-now) D-Block
(Now listen, now listen, now listen)
