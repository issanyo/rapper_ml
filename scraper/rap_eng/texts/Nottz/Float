"I want you to float, float, float, float"
"I want you to float, float, float, float, float"

Uhh, uhh

Come and float with me, come and smoke with me
Have a toast with me, put your dutch in the air
Come on and smoke with me
I get so high I dive through the clouds
So I need a parachute just to come back down
And I float - float through the town
The top is rolled back, the windows rolled down
And I smoke about a O a day, nothin' but that dro and haze
On that Remy shit, high till I hit the cage
And I blazed since 93, so why change
My eyes red, my cop filled like Lil Wayne
I can feel the raindrops when I'm gettin' wet
Come and get with the kid, cuz I want you to "float"

Come and float with me - "float"
Come and smoke with me - "float"
We get so dizzy - "float"
We don't need no crissy - "float"
Come and float with me - "float"
Come and smoke with me - "float"
We get so busy - "float"
We could get so pissy -"float"
Come and float with me - "float"
Come and smoke with me -"float"
We get so dizzy - "float"
We don't need no crissy - "float"
Just a little purple rain and a dutch - "float"
Tell Scotty he can beam me on up, cuz -"float"
"I want you to float"

Your boy Term float through like Casper
I got my dutch with me, but it ain't my master
I smoke heavy, even with my pastor
Might cough up a lung, but it ain't my astma
The ice in my cop look like Alaska
I ain't lookin' at you dudes, I'm lookin' past ya
You tryin' to flow, was the question I asked ya
I can tell in the face you want me to go faster
I smoke like the barrel, float like the clouds
Toke like tical, even Meth know my style
I got trees for sale, blazed as hell
Come though half baked like Dave Chappelle
And I "want you to float"

Picture the kid sittin' back on a lake
Puffin a corona grape, sippin' a Corona straight
I never like to the sesamille go to waste
So you politic on the L you know I'm gonna hate
Saw this Barbie, chillin' up the Kenasea
Said she wanna kick it and smoke with Term Marley
After we uhh, shorty prolly adore me
But I left her out of space, so she can't even call me
I float - float like Harley
Or float like Cypress Hill throwin' a party
It's something, something, something, something and something
And then I chica, chica, uh, uh, uh-uh
Cuz "I want you to float"
