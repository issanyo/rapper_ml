[Verse 1]
If I can be somebody
I'ma give it all that I know
Charlie tell me what it’s on now
All my brothers tryna get it fa sho
Plus we young and we got no hope
All we know we tryna get us some dough
If I ever cop me one mil'
I'ma cop a [?] Lambo
I’ll free my cousins and my uncles
Know the system tryna take my kinfolk
Way I look at situations
It can either be triumph or trouble
Peeping game from all the OGs
Don't say nothing but I watch from afar
When you older things gon' make sense
How sometimes they compromise who they are

[Chorus]
But you know I gotta
Go and get it, go and get it, yea
Know I gotta
Go and get it, go and get it, yea
Know I gotta
Go and get it, go and get it, yea
Know I gotta

But you know I gotta
Go and get it, go and get it, yea
Know I gotta
Go and get it, go and get it, yea
Know I gotta
Go and get it, go and get it

[Verse 2]
Look inside my face now
See I'm last of a dying breed
If I ever cop me one mil'
Make that bread inherent to all my seeds
Get my grandma off the south side
That's my goal before it's her time to go
Gotta show her what's the bright side
’Cause know nothing is promised tomorrow
Children of the immigrants bruh
Came here to chase Americans’ dream
But they got here to the states now
And realized it isn't all that it seems
Working every single day now
Just to make sure we got something to eat
I know one of us gon’ make it
If not them and then it's got to be me

[Chorus (2x)]
But you know I gotta
Go and get it, go and get it, yea
Know I gotta
Go and get it, go and get it, yea
Know I gotta
Go and get it, go and get it, yea
Know I gotta
