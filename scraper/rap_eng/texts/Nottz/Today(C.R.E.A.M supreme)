Today we living in a tragedy
A computer programmed falacy
Citizens lost in a sea of egocentricity
Worshipping mediocrity and false idols
It's a blasphemy, blinded by our own enemy
Subconsciously conforming to the annunaki gods
Mental slavery is the new law, there's been a plan in place since before we first played pitfall
But we too distracted to notice with our eyeballs
And The Buddhists have known it all along
Sometimes the through hurts
But it can be digested if written in song
So come along and take my palm
Open up your 3rd eye and keep calm
Who cares if they tell you you're wrong
Let it be known, that your not John doe
And your purpose in life is not to be sold

We enslaved to the ways of old
They don't want you to know that our souls shine gold
That's why distractions have taken hold
Black vs white, invisible boarder lines
Brick and mortar time, it's time to defend human kind
No more blind eye, we see the truth in the all seeing eye
No more pie in the sky
Planned depopulation and we never ask why
So check this proposition y'all, let's fight this evil with goodwill and watch those shadow figures fall
Before Marshall law has officially been declared on all
It's time to stand together tall, and watch those blue bloods crumble and fall

Consciousness was a gift to all
Now the selfishness just pours out from the jaw
Turn up, turn out, watch the brain cells fall
Burn up, zone out so daily that you get complacent and hazy
Ok with the displacement cause you forgot what ya did today khed
I don't know, but it's time to change the ways of the hatred
I don't care what you think young Bush
But its time to eat the rich
Its Time to Hit that polar shift switch
Cause sometimes it feels as if we living in a bad dream
Lost in our ways Where human misery is king
But vibrations are the things that make consciousness reign supreme
(consciousness rules everything around me)
