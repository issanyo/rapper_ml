[Intro]
You not loyal
I won’t buy you a house
But you smart though

[Hook]
Baby you a jerk, baby you a jerk
You think I just rap all day and don’t work?
Baby you a jerk, baby you a jerk
You think I just rap all day and don’t work?
Burn your incense, burn your hydro
They burn bridges too, what do I know?
Burn your incense, burn your hydro
They burn bridges too, what do I know?
Baby mamas on they grind, baby mamas on they grind
Baby mamas on they grind
Kick your feet up sometimes, kick your feet up sometimes

[Verse 1]
She shop wholesale at the drama store
Bring up shit from a long time
Fall ball like a domino, phenomenal
Make like Geronimo, I gotta go
Di-di-da-di-do, di-di-di-di-da
Konichiwa, hope you not needy ma
Only thing I provide is a vibe
Netflix, a couch, tranquillity inside
Turn down marriages bride by the brides
They in the hive, you wanna go inside?
My tenderoni, you so phony
Rolly polly, lady you know you owe me
What? Lady you know you owe me
A whole lot, lady you know you owe me
You could break it down and show me
Kick it with your homie, kick it with your homie

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
A lot of missed calls, I know you miss me
Our magic is madness and it’s a tragedy
A lot of missed calls, I know you miss me
Our magic is madness and it’s a tragedy
Cause I was diggin’ you, you were diggin’ me
I was diggin’ you, you really diggin’ me
You really, really diggin’ me
Now we bugign’ and we turnin’ into frenemies
Yo why you actin’ like that? Put your rachet shit back
You a queen baby girl, not for [?]
Never see me like that, for the way that I act
The load that I’m carryin’ would break up your back baby
Stop playin’ baby, break up the sack
You know we ain’t gon’ break up like that
You say you’re sorry and you take it all back
Somthin’, somthin’, somethin’, hit the vap’ and relax

[Hook]

[Outro]
Eh yo, act like you know that we done this before
Eh yo, act like you know how we done this before
Eh yo, act like you know, act like you know
Act like you know, eh yo, eh yo, eh yo
Act like you know that we done this before
Eh yo, act like you know how we done this before
Eh yo, eh yo, eh yo
