[Intro]
Which side are you on, friend? Which side are you on?
Which side are you on, friend? Which side are you on?
Justice for Mike Brown, justice for us all
Justice for Mike Brown, justice for us all
(He was a thug)

[Hook 1]
Which side are you on, boy? The silence is unappreciated
Which side are you on, my lord? I'mma go ahead and take that as disrespect
Which side are you on, boy? Silence is death, yes
Which side are you on, my lord? Get off the fence son
Get off the bench son
Which side are you on, boy? Who will stand to defend us?
Which side are you on, my lord? If you ain't with us, you against us

[Verse 1: Talib Kweli]
We drawing a line in the sand
You with us or against us? Gotta decide where you stand
There's an angel and a demon inside of every man
It's completely up to you, who getting the upper hand?
I make my music for the people
Survival guide the ruthless, be confusing it with evil
When I say "the people" I don't just mean the ones that agree with me
I'm on the side of the people regardless of who they seem to be following

[Hook 2]
Which side are you on, boy? Get off the fence son
Which side are you on, my lord Get off the bench son
Which side are you on, boy? Who will stand to defend us?
Which side are you on, my lord If you ain't with us, you against us
Which side are you on, boy? Get off the fence son
Which side are you on, my lord Get off the bench son
Which side are you on, boy? Who will stand to defend us?
Which side are you on, my lord If you ain't with us, you against us

[Verse 2: Talib Kweli]
Ain't none of these deaths making sense
Nothing is sacred when you suffering to pay your rent
Celebrities be making money off the powerless
They silence in the face of injustice is just cowardice
I roll with a crew that ain't never scared of the challenges
We don't wait for the tragedies, freedom is the catalyst
We don't call in the cavalry, we the leaders we waiting on
You standing up for justice, then trust us, this is your favorite song
They want us caught up in more legal drama than Law & Order
In the streets police is on trial and rappers is the court reporters
You won't be more then one of the lambs they fattening up for the slaughter
If you don't pull your weight and draw your water for our daughters
How a kid without a gun become a threat to cops
When they let off shots, hoping that his head will pop and that his breath will stop?
Gotta be satisfied with waiting until we get the verdict
It's just perverted, no justice for the family of the kid they murdered

[Bridge: Kendra Ross]
Today, today, who you gonna be?
Who you rollin' with?
Quit your stalling, all or nothing
Which side are you on?
Today, today, who you gonna be?
Who you rollin' with?
Pick your poison
Which side are you on?

[Verse 3: Tef Poe]
Gold choppers, [?] match my eyes if they road block us
Martin on my arm, but the struggle made me more Malcolm
Demon in the smoke, kush burnin' like Ferguson
Fuck Obama and Don Lemon, nigga, the nerve of them
CNN, CNN but they ain't seein' him
Tears of the tear gas, tears of the Elohim
P-O-E the priest, hit a pig with a prison shank
God got me, copy? I ain't scared of a fuckin' tank
Glorious struggle, shout out my brother Tory Russell
[?]
Don't put a bullet hole in my spleen
New millennium [?], and no Zionists (?) in my dreams
Don't kill me for that line, conceal me or flat lines
I don't believe in no laws, I don't believe in your God
It's your block for my black freedom, put a car bomb in your heart
Black child, ain't no love in this bitch
Feed your seed and get your chopper like the government did
P-O-E

[Hook 2]
Which side are you on, boy? Get off the fence son
Which side are you on, my lord Get off the bench son
Which side are you on, boy? Who will stand to defend us?
Which side are you on, my lord If you ain't with us, you against us
Which side are you on, boy? Get off the fence son
Which side are you on, my lord Get off the bench son
Which side are you on, boy? Who will stand to defend us?
Which side are you on, my lord If you ain't with us, you against us
