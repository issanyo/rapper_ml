[Clive Davis]
Well Busta Rhymes
It's been a long time since you've had a good talking to
And the last time I gave you my blessing
I told ya, you was gonna encounter a lot of niggas and bitches
Tryin' to get into your shit
Well, you've come a long ways
Since me, the bad ass Dolemite paid you a visit
And even up to this point
You ain't seen shit yet
From what I understand
You done built you a brand new home
So this time around
Before you welcome these motherfuckers in yo shit
Make sure they know the rules
Rule Number 1:
Busta Rhymes is your name
And breaking motherfuckers down
Is your game
Rule Number 2:
As you continue to give it to 'em raw
Before they come into your house
Make sure they wipe they feet
At the motherfuckin door
Rule Number 3:
Before these niggas misconceive you as a pranksta
Make sure these motherfuckers respect your gangsta
Now moving right along
As you enter this new place in your growth
Like I told you before:
Keep slappin' dick in the mouth of these bitches
That don't wanna act right
And put a hot one in any motherfucker
That tries to get in the way of this power move shit right here
Alright Busta, enough with this shit talkin
Let's welcome these motherfuckers into THE Genesis
Alright baby
Let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go
