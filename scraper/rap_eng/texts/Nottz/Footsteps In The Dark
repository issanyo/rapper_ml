[Isley Brother's sample]
"I keep hearin' footsteps baby, in the dark, oh in the dark"

[Bishop talking]
I'm gonna get something goin' off. This is one of my momma's favorites
It's classic man. I'm gonna put a twist to it though
You know, upgrade it. To right now. Check it out

[Verse 1: Bishop Lamont]
It's probably that robbery you did way back
Jacked them niggas for they dope, they always said they'd get you back
You'd be surprised how some of these guys can find out where you live at
It could have happened on March, it's never too far for the payback
Fake name at the motel, same thang with the rent-a-car
Okay swell, always keep your eyes on details
And watch out for them females
They'll get you sent
That's the same shit that got that actor Romeo wet
Never have too many bitches all off at your spot
That's in the top five reasons why most niggas get got
Let they guards down for pussies so it's hard to block
Got Jasmine Guy in your bed, that bitch hiddin' a Glock
That's the Harlem Night special, it happens a lot
Heat the sheets, squeeze the trigger or she let 'em in your spot
Wake up to a double barrel pointed at your knot
I ain't sayin' that's the case but just possibly
Why?

[Hook]
"I, keep hearing footsteps baby
In the dark, oh in the dark
Why? I keep hearing footsteps baby
In the dark
Oh in the dark, hoo" - 'Footsteps In The Dark' - The Isley Brothers

[Verse 2: Bishop Lamont]
It ain't gotta be drugs or some nigga you shot
It can be over love or some bitch you got
Or an ex all vexed cause he miss her a lot
So he snuck up in your complex waitin' to pop
Fuck gang bangin', pussy get a lot of niggas shot
A pussy will shoot you, you know how these bitches do
Jealousy is a motherfucker
We've all been warned
That Hell hath no fury like a woman scorned
They act sweet till you make 'em act mean
Get caught tryin' to creep and feel the heat like Al Green
That's the least of your worries when niggas be gettin' buried
Them suicide bitches make shrines out your pictures
Run up to your car and pop nines at your bitches
Have you on the news in your homie's T-shirt
Better watch the hoes you choose, niggas do your research
Cause you don't wanna lose and have to cruise in that hearse
You sayin'....

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Bishop Lamont]
Now before I get indited, charges bein' one sided
The perspective for you ladies, unbiasly is provided
Cause I knew you was gon' hate and debate, don't even try it
Label me a woman hater cause the verses I recited
I admit, we niggas is crazy
But that don't mean go and have the motherfuckers baby
When you met him, that nigga was slangin'
You on the phone like Martin said, "Girl I can change him."
Ain't no changin' that
Ain't no changin' this
Especially when you dicknotized off some good dick
He can beat on you cheat on you and you still gon' stay
Cause he fuck you right, apologize, then it's okay
But it's not and it never will be
Move back home with your momma cryin', "He tried to kill me."
You scared to leave him cause he said if you leavin'
It'll be not breathin'
Guess who in your window peekin'?

[Hook]

[Outro]
Uh, yeah, huh, yeah, I love this song
Shouts out to the Isley Brothers. Mr. Biggs
Thank you, so much. Haha, low down dirty woman
Back to where you come from. Hahaha
Oh yeah, um, just-just liner footnote, um, about
You know, the women, cause you know
I'm gonna get hate on for the third verse
But the shit that be trippin' me out is...
They be fuckin' with a nigga that got a girl
You know what I'm sayin', cheatin' with the nigga
Then they get with and get mad when he cheat on them
That's some crazy shit. Hahaha
Yeah, shouts out to Nottz. Big Darryl. All of Virginia
Huh, Patrick Tarrantino. Yeah. P.S....Beeotch!
"I, keep hearing footsteps baby
In the dark, oh in the dark"
