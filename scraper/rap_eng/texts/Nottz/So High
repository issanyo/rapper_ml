[Chorus]
Yeah
Up, I'm up so high, I'm on the moon
I believe I can fly on the moon
Floating away like I'm a balloon, yeah
I get, I get so high on the moon

[Verse: Peanut da Don]
Way too fucking young to fly
Yeah, I'm way too fucking young to die
I'm way too fucking real to chill
I'm way too fucking ill for real, lego
Got a Jamaican, she gon' roll it up for me, let's smoke
Back and forth, out of fucking country, Rio, we go
I put my fucking footprints up on the moon
I got high and got a room, made a pool full of shrooms
How cool, I was dreaming I met a bitch at the bar
Yeah, she didn't hesitate, she jumped right in the car
Yeah, she asked me, how much weed are we gonna do?
I told her, shoot at the moon and she might hit her a star, yeah, yeah

[Chorus]
Yeah
Up, I'm up so high, I'm on the moon
I believe I can fly on the moon
Floating away like I'm a balloon, yeah
I get, I get so high on the moon

[Verse: London Jae]
On that moon, moon rock get high with my boys
See more stars than a hip-hop award
Aye, let me shout out to God
There go Busta, sitting swole wearing thirty chain
We with the Snoop, rolling cookies on a paper plane
Mixing seven different flavors trying to make a name
I get so high, if I ever cry it'll probably fucking rain
Uh, blazing up that made hell sweat
Backwood stuff with that eighth, I know you smell that
Weed man a day away he got to mail that
Inhale that purple pill, Percocet, I don't sell that
I be higher than noon, where the 12 at?
Geeked up, flow me a rain ditch, you like a jail pet

[Chorus]
Yeah
Up, I'm up so high, I'm on the moon
I believe I can fly on the moon
Floating away like I'm a balloon, yeah
I get, I get so high on the moon

[Verse: Yung Dro]
I'm actually over seas in the castle of trap
In this natural hustling radical,  we're no compatible
Killing is in me, your jeans too skinny to run from the calico
Dope on the avenue, polo is lavender, murder, murder, murder, tactical
This is a trap, this is the block, order, order, order, magical
People are racing the condo, getting dust rolled but young dro
And head honcho
I was born in the condo, if a nigga want to catch a fade
Get beat like bongos
Rhyme on rhyme, hurts an old Cutlass, fo-fo, two butknicks
I got a stick in the motor and not with you, bitch
I will shoot you and your lil' slut bitch

[Verse: TI]
Yeah, alway been blessed, we ain't never been lucky
Mine always on mind, no time for that fuck shit
Yeah, we're taught to get a quarter ki and push it
C-can't you rip the pillow, aight koosh
Yeah, we get the old Charger country rookie
So when class in session, don't be playing hooky
Moon rock in my QP and a [?]
Loose leaf, pop a Percocet, get some alcohol and a little buzz
I'm gone, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Chorus]
Yeah
Up, I'm up so high, I'm on the moon
I believe I can fly on the moon
Floating away like I'm a balloon, yeah
I get, I get so high on the moon
