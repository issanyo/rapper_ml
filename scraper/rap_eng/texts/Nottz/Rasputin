A good old slobberknocker, this like a Jaromír Jágr
Shot up top beyond the block, or chalk it up and pound a lager
Provocateur, a package you cannot ignore
Lock the doors and mop the floor, they pop the cork when I record
Cyborg of swords in the war between the worlds
I've warned the world, one more word I'm born to throw it overboard
No shortage of the words I got em for galore[?]
Even though my straw was short I turned it to a snorkel, dork
Working while you urkels sit and circlejerk
Sure it isn't perfect but you nerd-alerts deserve the worst
Turn me to a murderer
Learning how to burn and earn and Verne[?] and learn and Shirley
Who is that I never heard of her?
If Bert and Ernie birthed the cat burglar
I'd be the first person caused aversion using furniture
It's twelfth ocean, if hell's frozen it's hell, I'm open
It's Seth Rogen with no phone, my cell's broken
Hell no this ain't a sing-along
I'ma need to build the bonfire plus a bigger bong
I've been shelved for over four years cause of Scooter Braun
Who the fuck are you to ask me what the hell I'm doing wrong?
Chilling I'm just doing me
Doing what I feel I need
Doing what you do for cool, truth is what I do for free
(Truth is what I do for free, truth is what I do for free, truth is what I do for free free free, free)

Shooters keep shooting, soon enough you gon' feel the heat
We gon' pull through it, ain't you ever seen the "Field of Dreams"?
Gotta keep believing even when they say they threw the key
Root it up, pollute it, who you fooling? This ain't new to me
