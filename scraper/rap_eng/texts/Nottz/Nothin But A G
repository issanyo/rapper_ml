[Verse One]
Eazy-E low riders on a busy block
A couple karats in the face, now that's a busy watch
You put me anywhere I swear I gets busy, watch
You let that boy cook, and I don't need a pot
The fire hit the skillet, now that's the Jiffy pot
I take it to the corner, I don't need a spot
I'm moving like the one, twos and ya don't stop
DMP nigga, that's that ready rock
Ha
My name heavy like Debo nigga
You'se a New Jack, this bigger than Nino nigga
They know my shit hard
Shaq
Free throws nigga
Them other niggas lost, like Nemo nigga

[?]
Yeah
Now here's a taste to the night life
And she addicted like a fiend to the crack pipe
That easy money make the rainy days sunny
And I'm hungry for that cake, gotta feed that appetite
I'm trying to eat a lil' something
Stack that bread while y'all skinny nigga lunching
Serve drug with the thugs, DMP is what I'm pumping
I got ya sweating, body numb, nose running
Run with the Goonie niggas, Paul Bunyans
That'll bang that hammer have your whole squad's running
40 yard dash, before your life flash
Put one in y'alls ass if one of y'all ask

[Hook]
Yeah
Big faces, small faces
Had the Feds here, had small cases
But one thing about me
I'm solid as a rock, real as can be
And y'all can't deny it we been straight riders
The V love DMP, yeah yeah
They can't do nothing to a G
And I'ma keep 100, seven days of the week

[Verse Two]
It's that Durte shit
What I'm speaking leave you leaking through your tourniquet
Pay attention my nigga you might learn some shit
The crack addicts is happy we back at it
And you don't want no static or you become a statistic
Two cups in my hand, I'm double fisted
My lyrics make more bread than Bisquick
You Carl Thomas niggas Emotional on some bitch shit
I eat MC's for a midnight snack
Just a whole bunch of gift bag niggas who can't rap/wrap
You had plans my niggas came to spoil it
We the shit, your whole career is flushed down the toilet

[?]
Aye look
Solid as a rock with this DMP campaign
Go against the grain till she brain like champagne
Ask her what's good in the hood, not a damn thang
Try to walk the walk, end up pulling a hamstring
Hater
Sit on me, see you later
Tough guy, eye for an eye like The Raiders
You a Tweet beef, I'm a chief chief reefer
Acting like a little pussy, I don't mind eating beaver
Rap two up, two down, V to the A, aye
It's the west Fabulous from the V to the Bay
And I mean what I said better peep what I say nigga
Niggas cold blooded, get the heat from the K
Say yeah

[Hook]
