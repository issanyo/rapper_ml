[Chorus]
She's got diamonds in her eyes
Dreaming 'bout the fame and all those lights
Thinking 'bout the parties and the Hollywood sign
My darling, my darling
She's got diamonds in her eyes
Thinking 'bout all those famous guys
And I just want her by my side
My darling, my darling

[Verse 1]
Let me tell you 'bout a girl I know
She thinks that her life is a TV-show
Always talk about where she'll go
And I'm convinced she's delusional
Let me tell you 'bout a girl who stole my heart
All she ever talks about is movie stars
She reads her books and makes her art
But it feels so good when she's in my arms
'Cause she's so beautiful
'Cause she's so beautiful, oh oh
And she knows I love her soul
She knows, she knows
So maybe, baby, could you save me?
If I were famous, would you date me?
Oh, maybe I'll make it there
But you still be going nowhere

[Interlude]
When I raise them in the skies
Sun's so bright, it burns and I
Grinding all over girl's best friend
[?] weekend
When I raise them in the skies
Sun's so bright, it burns and I
Grinding all over girl's best friend
[?] weekend

[Chorus]
She's got diamonds in her eyes
Dreaming 'bout the fame and all those lights
Thinking 'bout the parties and the Hollywood sign
My darling, my darling
She's got diamonds in her eyes
Thinking 'bout all those famous guys
And I just want her by my side
My darling, my darling

[Verse 2]
Let me tell you 'bout a girl who stays at home
And then complains that she's alone
She likes her rum and her Patron
She's having fun when she gets drunk
That kind of girl who likes to sleep all day
But parties all night 'til it gets late
She's always tired when we hang
That shit got old, it's kinda lame
But I think she's still cool
I think she's still cool
[?] played me for a fool
[?] played me
So girl, just know when you be watching Netflix
I be wear [?], cooking up my next hit
Wait, hold up - I can cook you breakfast
But all she really wanted was a diamond neckless

[Interlude]
When I raise them in the skies
Sun's so bright, it burns and I
Grinding all over girl's best friend
[?] weekend
When I raise them in the skies
Sun's so bright, it burns and I
Grinding all over girl's best friend
[?] weekend

[Bridge]
I should have know better, I should have known better
I should forget but I never say never
You broke my heart, now I put it back together
But I'm still in love so I'm writing love letters

[Chorus]
She's got diamonds in her eyes
Dreaming 'bout the fame and all those lights
Thinking 'bout the parties and the Hollywood sign
My darling, my darling
She's got diamonds in her eyes
Thinking 'bout all those famous guys
And I just want her by my side
My darling, my darling
