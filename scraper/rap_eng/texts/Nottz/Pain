[Intro: T.I.]
The human nature of this society
Will flat-line your reality
If you fail to realize
Pain is a part of the game
For those who don’t know me
Don’t ever dodge pain and adversity because
Pain is just weakness leaving the body man

[Hook: T.I.]
Pain just the weakness when it leaving the body
Pain just the weakness when it leaving the body
Ill on my name be aware when you speak
Ill on my name and you say it better mean it
Pain just the weakness when it leaving the body
Pain just the weakness when it leaving the body
Ill on my name be aware when you speak
Ill on my name be aware when you speak

[Verse 1: T.I.]
The truth hurts as well as bullets I got ‘em both
You do dirty like Yeezy shows you gotta go
No more excusing the flaw if you could be bought then
I’d rather see you die than the movement
A savage only if [?] missing dues
Never too old for a pruning
Staying silent try my best to mind my business
But you ain’t down with the advancement then deuces
I live my life just like I kick it in my music
Watch your mouth you had a [?] for sale
Something stupid, of all things
And I don’t give a damn if you ballin’
Step aside when the revolution coming

[Hook: T.I.]
Pain just the weakness when it leaving the body
Pain just the weakness when it leaving the body
Ill on my name be aware when you speak
Ill on my name and you say it better mean it
Pain just the weakness when it leaving the body
Pain just the weakness when it leaving the body
Ill on my name be aware when you speak
Ill on my name be aware when you speak

[Verse 2: London Jae]
Now who gon’ smoke
I got a clip for every nigga you know
I’m bringing pain bought every fucking bullet up in the store
Malcolm and Martin probably turning over in they grave
The movement gon’ move regardless
With or without you modern slave
Token niggas, soft spoken house niggas, and hopeless niggas
Pussy ass Uncle Tom poster boy, focus nigga
Read some shit today they tried to feed that man some shit Ain’t that some shit?
They shoulda killed that bitch, fuck capital punishment
Mr. Officer how the fuck you the law when you offin' us
Now we ask for their respect instead you make us a offer to kiss your ass
Ignore the racial divide
Only way weakness ain’t painful is if you keep it inside

[Hook: T.I.]
Pain just the weakness when it leaving the body
Pain just the weakness when it leaving the body
Ill on my name be aware when you speak
Ill on my name and you say it better mean it
Pain just the weakness when it leaving the body
Pain just the weakness when it leaving the body
Ill on my name be aware when you speak
Ill on my name be aware when you speak

[Verse 3: T.I.]
Fuck the other side, ain’t no love at all
If ain’t no love for us, we tryna fuck ’em all
I know you feel like you a gangsta acting tough and all
But left and right they locking niggas up for nothing dawg
Take it how it comes give no fuck at all
Say, "bitches, US or else," till there’s nothing else
Nothing to fear but fear itself
I fear no one but God
Put that on Franklin Roosevelt
Pool-side at the Roosevelt
I give a damn how much dough I dealt
Never compromising my principles no going out
Seattle mariner [?]
'Cause life is mandatory end of story, yeah

[Hook: T.I.]
Pain just the weakness when it leaving the body
Pain just the weakness when it leaving the body
Ill on my name be aware when you speak
Ill on my name and you say it better mean it
Pain just the weakness when it leaving the body
Pain just the weakness when it leaving the body
Ill on my name be aware when you speak
Ill on my name be aware when you speak
