[Nottz]
Lil' nigga, I'm a muh'fuckin monster, I drool when I talk

Eyes stay blood red cause I ain't slept in a hundred years

Thinkin you can fuck wit the boy {UH UH, DEM LIE!}
Nuff dem die and fry for that shit, dig it? {DIG IT? Dig it? dig it?}
Now what yo' GOD-damn problem is?!

Before I putcho' monkey ass on down like you went wild from a zoo {*monkey screeches, gunshot*}

And a fourth of that be frontin

[Edgar Allen Floe]
Aiyyo, you get slapped up in VA
Transported to NC, now who the fuck wanna see E?!
10 o' clock news got your face up on the TV
Missing motherfuck, from my clutches he wanna be free
Break the shackles, Kunta Kinte slave
Naw, homie! (Naw homie!) Sitcha ass down, Toby
The god speaks mathematics, I will bring noise
Cause this year, in my cipher, I build and destroy
This is grown-man shit lil' boy, you still potty-training
Straight outta Raleigh blazin, you still prol'ly hatin
And Floe is goin apeshit, breakin the law to the matrix
For you there's no escapin, L you facin
So take THIS! (THIS) - a small word of advice
Stay the FUCK out my path, you truly valued your life?
Edgar Allen Floe is lethal, one over zero
Keepin the undefined, no effort but still shine

[Royce Da 5'9"]
GO! Nigga run
Nottz ask me for ANYTHING, it's Yung Berg's carrer - DONE
Extended cartridge, I call you niggas food
Cause you get hands put on you at any market, uh!
Besides rollin with Gs' is my crew
Responsible for the "No-fly zone" in the D
You come THRU, you betta call somebody, cause we don't care
We'll leave witcha legs and leave the wheelchair
Uh, we'll sit in ya bushes prepared for a shootout
Wit a couple of extra militias and pushers
If you don't get it, you can get it, forget it, we run the city
The bitch, wit me, she pretty, she British, she bring the kitty to the vet!
(WHOO!) Ah, nigga I'm lethal, I take ya whole city on
All I need is me and ten of my people
Ah, nigga I'm a winner, my bitch name is Victoria
Ah, I go hard, they call me a go-to warrior, OUT!
