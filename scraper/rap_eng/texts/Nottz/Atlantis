[Intro: Blu]
Turn me up!
Turn me up!

[Verse 1: Blu]
A son of God
A virgin with a gun
Another song makes it to number one
Everybody's rich
Nobody wants to die
It's a new day
Airplanes in the sky
A hardworking mom drops her kids off at school
The world stop today on the evening news
Turn your cells off
The gas prices fell
I was just a kid
Some days, it's hard to tell
Hotel, motel, holiday vaycay
New year, wedding anniversary, birthday
Lunchtime, dinnertime, breakfast
Another man got up today legless
Let us be grateful for eggs and mother's milk
Does a body good like wearing silk
We chilled out, rolling trees on the balcony
Gold teeth, living free in the South

[Hook: Blu]
Atlantis

[Verse 2: Blu]
Folks that don't lie
Dreams and bowties
Magazine wroter was dope, but young lady did a coke line
Clothes on her clothesline
Nobody's at home
Just a kid at the liquor store
A dollar twenty-five
Any prize at the bottom is mine
Close your eyes
Make a wish
Six minutes 'til showtime
The politician fumbled his lines
I changed the channel
There's a window in my living room
I like to travel
Tags on the Metro
The girls in the bathroom
The White Lauryn Hill
The new D'Angelo album
Cincinnati hits the tree
I write a leaf to a beat on repeat
First class, switch seats
The [?] grips the heat
His chain [?]
The game is tied up
The world needs a savior
I'm looking at my Gucci
It's about that time
One glance at the gods and earths
Priceless

[Hook: Blu]
Atlantis

[Verse 3: Blu]
Hundred and forty-four thousand
Public housing in Hugh Hefner's state
Riker's Island
Django when the stars' spangle
My chain dangles
City of the lost angels
Attica, attica
The bugs in the attic
Static
Rap classics
Black magic
Fear of a black planet
The aircraft landed
I'm Anderson Cooper and everybody's English
Jim [?] young
[?]
A man without a tongue
The weight of two tons
One gun
The benefiters of world peace --- everyone
Einstein, Edison, the presidents, medicine, medical cards, free health care benefits
I switched my plates
Moved to a new residence
I never got lost

[Hook: Blu]
