[Verse 1: Bishop Lamont]
If you'se a bitch nigga, y'all not gonna feel this
Only real niggas fuck with the realness
Cali done changed so much
I can tell you gettin' senile cause you loosin' your touch
You can't keep it gangster wearin' (muuuuhahahah!)
What you shootin' at? Rattle snakes and cougars?
Did you like how I said cougars?
Cause that's that boushe shit
You'se a movie flick
Click
So I'm turnin' you off
Silence switch the station
No switchin' conversation
I kill niggas on tracks like Final Destination
Part 3
Don't start me
My kill is so deep they shoot them shit's in R.V.'s
I'm jackin' yo shit
Hand me the car keys
West coast is mine, move over sorry
I thought you was a (muuuuhahaha!) but you're a sharpie

[Hook]
Rappers wanna sing
Singers wanna rap
I guess the world's about to end when shit get's that wack
(It's all over!)
Rappers wanna act, stand up comics wanna rap
Pretty please Nick Cannon don't try to come back
(Stop the madness!)
Every song got a dance, every dance gotta snack
Nigga stay out the kitchen when you writtin' your raps
(No more food!)
Every rapper ain't a gangster just because they got a strap
You know it's your body guards kid at bat
(Bitch nigga)

[Verse 2: Bishop Lamont]
See, fake niggas hate the truth
So you know they really hate it when I step in the booth
I'm a one man army
Bishop Hannibal Kahn
Ridin' on elephant back with a couple firearms
Keep a shank in my sweatpants
Give a nigga a tracheotomy, give me a wrong glance
Per chance
You ain't heard
I'm a real ass nigga, I don't mince my words
Disrespect me, you gon' get what you deserve
Trespass, will have your ass bite down on the curb
You don't know what happens next?
I suggest you go and rent American History X
Yeah
I'm smashin' rappers heads in
Mad about it? Blame Dre, he let me in
If it's beef, Farrakhan can't save you
Better go get Rev. Run to pray for you

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Bishop Lamont]
Let me apologize New York (I'm sorry)
These fake gangster niggas livin' in a time warp (It ain't '86)
We ain't just khaki's and Dickies
Gangster's got baps
Gangster's rock silk
Timberlands, dress shoes and fools still get killed
I know they look like the man in they video
But real life can't come back to their city yo
Ain't it pitiful?
Um, um, um
But nope, not me
I be where I wanna be, see what I wanna see
That ain't an entourage nigga, that's my family
Blood relatives, not just close friends
If not I'm dolo
Dippin' up the 1-10
You a Ain't-No-More
Fuck a has been
Cut the killer talk nigga, let's scrap then
Boom ping ping
You know what'll happen

[Hook]

[Outro]
Ha ha ha. That's right nigga. You gotta let niggas know man
Niggas doin' a lot of wack shit out there right now, that shit ain't cool
Step your motherfuckin' bars up nigga
Singers be singers, rappers be rappers nigga
Cut that cross dressin' out
