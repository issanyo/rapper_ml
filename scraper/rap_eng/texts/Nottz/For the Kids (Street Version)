[Intro: The Bad Seed]
Uh.  Uh.  Yeah.  Ayyo, turn the track up.  I want that shit to bang.  Uh.  Yeah.  Who better, nigga?  Let’s go

[Hook 1: Sample from Charles Strouse’s “We'd Like to Thank You Herbert Hoover"] (x2)
Today we're living in a shanty
Today we're scrounging for meal

[Verse 1: The Bad Seed]
Yo, you know Seed?  Then you know what heart is about
Gutter nigga—jeans sagging with a straw in my mouth
And if it's beef, fuck a song, dawg.  I'm calling you out
Pull the Ruger, bust around ‘til all of you out
Whether you broke as a joke or you balling with clout
You draw your gun, I’ll draw blood—next, they chalking you out
Niggas that walk in with you, they’ll be walking you out
Or rolling you out.  Whatever, dawg.  Hold this and bounce
And I'm gon' be that nigga ‘til I'm swollen with gout
And I ain't got no love for you—all I'm holding is doubt
Don't know a MAC from a TEC or a gram from a ounce
And what you know about them police patrolling your house?
Or the stashed cash you keep in the folds of the couch
The truth hurt, but we don't cry.  We say, "Ouch"
I'm old school like Kangaroo kicks with the pouch
I will smack you, separate your lips from your mouth

[Hook 1 (Overlapped with Hook 2): Sample from Charles Strouse’s “We'd Like to Thank You Herbert Hoover"] (x4)
Today we're living in a shanty
Today we're scrounging for meal

[Hook 2 (Overlapped with Hook 1): The Bad Seed] (x2)
It’s for the niggas, durag, doobie, dread
Ho hustling, children fed
Project, street corners, Dutchies, weed
Seed love the kids ‘cause the kids love Seed

[Verse 2: The Bad Seed]
Surprise, duke.  I'm like The Roots winning the Grammy
Pull a jammie, blow your peepee off, ending your family
I want the Benz, but fuck it.  I'll be straight with the Camry
Type nigga to bag your moms, go straight for the panty
Y'all niggas be spitting fire, but I'm upping the ante
I’ll spit sun rays invisible, hot as Miami
Hotter than Jewish folks that was beefing with Hitler
Apocalyptic, every line I’ll spit is a scripture
God said, "Let there be light, birds, and trees
Let there be water and fire.  Fuck it, let there be Seed"
There ain't a nigga, bitch, or kid that better than Seed
I tell it like it is down to the letter like me

[Hook 1 (Overlapped with Hook 2): Sample from Charles Strouse’s “We'd Like to Thank You Herbert Hoover"] (x4)
Today we're living in a shanty
Today we're scrounging for meal

[Hook 2 (Overlapped with Hook 1): The Bad Seed] (x2)
It’s for the niggas, durag, doobie, dread
Ho hustling, children fed
Project, street corners, Dutchies, weed
Seed love the kids ‘cause the kids love Seed

[Verse 3: The Bad Seed]
Ayyo, East Coast, West Coast, hold me down
I'ma make sure y'all motherfuckers know me now
Laugh at a nigga say he spit and blow me out
Be like, "Oh word? (*Gun shot*) Nigga, you heard?"  "No doubt."
Fuck around, get smacked in your mouth
Teeth on the floor, asking us 'bout why I did that in your house
I’ll spit for Elián González, spit for Brooklyn and Hollis
Spit for B.A. and broads that be getting their nails polished
My shit hot.  What's fucking with Seed and Nottz?
And what's fucking with two Glocks aimed right at a cop?
You couldn't see this nigga if you was nearsighted or not
But I’ll see a clip emptied right inside of your drop
Y'all gon' know my name whether you like it or not
You couldn't fuck with Bad Seed if you write it or not

[Hook 1 (Overlapped with Hook 2): Sample from Charles Strouse’s “We'd Like to Thank You Herbert Hoover"] (x8)
Today we're living in a shanty
Today we're scrounging for meal

[Hook 2 (Overlapped with Hook 1): The Bad Seed] (x2)
It’s for the niggas, durag, doobie, dread
Ho hustling, children fed
Project, street corners, Dutchies, weed
Seed love the kids ‘cause the kids love Seed

[Outro: The Bad Seed]
(Biatch!).  Uh.  (What y’all know ‘bout that?).  Uh.  (Ain’t know ‘bout that).  Yeah
