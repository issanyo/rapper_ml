[Chorus]
Gotta get up, gotta get out, gotta get home before the mornin' comes
What if I'm late, got a big date, gotta get home before the sun rise

[Verse 1]
I'm having trouble gettin' up and at em
I'm actually pretty happy just layin' on my mattress
There's this pretty young thing, real attractive
Laying half wake no that was just imagined
What time is it, shit need to get a grip
This drinkin' till I spin thing isn't gonna win
Binge drink on the weekends, chilling with my three friends
We get it in but I'm swimmin' in the deep end
I need a defense, need to build a big fence
Around my stomach linin' so the sickness couldn't creep in
But I weak in, see a Yinglueng and a SingSling yeah I need this just a few sips
Round three and I start to feel at ease
So I think I'll rest my feet and I will try to catch some Z's
Next thing you know I am fast asleep
Thought I was a grown up but it was just a dream

[Chorus]
Gotta get up, gotta get out, gotta get home before the mornin' comes
What if I'm late, got a big date, gotta get home before the sun rise
Gotta get up, gotta get out, gotta get home before the mornin' comes
What if I'm late, got a big date, gotta get home before the sun rise

[Verse 2]
Ahhhhh, why did I even wake up?
I'm feeling guilty so I guess I'll clean my place up
But first, I'mma need to pick my face up
My head hurts so much, I think that I erased em
Shut up, pretty please could you spare me
The only cure I see here is a cold Bloody Mary
But I'm barely in the mood to be standing
And outside there's the busy world of Richard Scarry
The rich has burried us inside the cemetary
And the only answer is a little bit of milk and berries
A White Russian shoulda get my blood pumpin'
Fuckin up my rug every time I'm gettin' drunk
This is dumb, last night it was fun
But I'm feelin' pretty shitty since the last shot of Rum
Tom hit me asked him to go for a run
Yo I'm bout to throw up, I'll hit you when I'm done

[Chorus]
Gotta get up, gotta get out, gotta get home before the mornin' comes
What if I'm late, got a big date, gotta get home before the sun rise
Gotta get up, gotta get out, gotta get home before the mornin' comes
What if I'm late, got a big date, gotta get home before the sun rise

[Verse 3]
Alright, enoughs enough I'm done bein' three
Its time for me, I kinda need to take responsibility
I think I'll shower, shave and put on deodorant
Get through the mornin' without the help of ibuprofen
I'll make a smoothie with berries and banana
And even place a call to that pretty girl Hannah
I'll tell her hi, hey, hm how are you?
I'm a little hung over but I think that I'll be cool
So I was hopin', well you know if you're free
That we could do a date, all alone you and me
Like a dinner yeah a meal or a flick
I don't really care anything you can pick
It's up to you, what's your mood, what you think?
Meet me at the bar, nine o'clock for a drink
