[Verse One]
I make students out of sensei's
Lock and load and put a hole in your mixtape
For some that's caught up in a trap here's an escape
I'm Evel
Knievel
I'm lethal
People
There's no equal I'm a fool with the few diesel
I'm on the grind, I drop a line and watch it pop weasels
The money I grow I still keep it low like caesar
Stay busy like a beaver and I wish you would/wood
And if you do then I wish you well
It's a wrap like a python
I'm on point like a tripod
The only way you play me is an Ipod
Snap like the animal that's sold on the Izod
This rapper not phony
I'm always in the hood like Obi Wan Kenobi
Put in work with the Durte with the one and only (Nottz)
Yo, rappers singing like Toni! Tone!
I spit that, Tony Soprano over piano
Hot as hell with a pair of gazelles
Hook the game like a pair of brasseries
Looka here, I ain't playing...
You hear what I'm saying?
Y'all so-soing fam, I'm so serious
If y'all ugly in the booth than I'm hideous
Guess y'all was looking for that Durte, here it is

[Hook] [Scratching]
"There it is"
You hear what I'm saying?
Us niggas ain't playing we back
Fuck you expect boy
Dope on deck boy
DMP shit get a hit of this crack
(And get a hit of this crack)
"Bitch!"
You hear what I'm saying?
Us niggas ain't playing we back
We ain't one of the same boy
Youngins is lame boy
Real is back, you ain't fucking with that
You ain't fucking with that

[Verse Two: Boogieman]
I make workers out of bosses
Tell a nigga quick, "Get in line or get a coffin."
You want some of my shit?
The joys of life can't get me off 'em
Make you wish your mother had an abortion
Judas wouldn't cross it
You can't playing and I pause 'em
(Boogie, Boogie, Boogie, Boogie)
I do this here often
Always, everyday, fucking with a G
Nigga sheeit!
The booth is like heaven to me like a pedophile at Chucky Cheese
Negro please
I go nuts, elephant dump
Knock 'em out like a club punch
Chasity belt these niggas are not fucking with us
I go underneath the belt for that in God we trust
Send you to God I must
Ashes to dust to dust
All that spiritual sheeit!
Is the truth now you spit
Faggot
I keep live like it's '95
On the corner like it's two for fives
Nigga

[Hook]

[Verse Three]
No smoke, no mirrors and no gimmicks
No little funny facade, no image
Fuck your hourly wage, get paid by the minute
I'm the shit when I spit, they spray when I finish
VA from the top of my head to my tennis
Find me rhyming and minding my own business
Fuck a flask in the lab like I'm a chemist
Super Bowl flow and you rhyme like it's a scrimmage
("Bitch!")
No time, no money to waste
But these 24 beers got me catching a case
Drop 'em off the side of the dock at Thames River
He's sleeping with the gators and crocs, he chopped liver
Hey, one in a million like Neo
My bankroll swoll' and Green like Cee-Lo
Durte Muzik nobody can do it better
Make an old timer with Alzheimers never forget us

[Hook]
