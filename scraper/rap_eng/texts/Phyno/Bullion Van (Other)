Plenty Money for bank and the pocket e too fat
When you see money dey fly, na we be that
All eyes on me I dey feel like e 2Pac
Anytime i come o the people like who be that? (who be that?)

Chorus:
Na we be the niggas wey dey step in the club with a bullion van
With a bullion van uh- oh with a bullion van

MI: (Verse 1)
Yeah, Yeah uh...the bottles are poppin'
The bottles are poppin' is nothing (x2)
We killing the money, we dey put am for coffin, Yeah
Then we offer condolence
You say that you're balling the score line is goalless
Anything wey don close, money go open am
You go think say na Bow Leg
Everything tear rubber, Mr. pharmacist ********??
As a Christian i must represent
Christian Louboutin, and Christian Dior
All these small boys with your shakara, all of them are faking
I've got money in Oil and Akara, Nigga, I've Bean Caking huh...

MI (Verse 2)
Baby you should get used to this
There are levels to this
And these small boys tryna Rock you
They are Pebbles to this
When you're hangin' with an MC
That can flow more than your menses
With his Benzs', and his Bentleys'
And the Pradas', the Givenchys...Yekpa !
The swagger is branded, the swagger is Janded
The swagger is confident, because, container has landed
We dey import and we export
And we hang-out at the best spots
With a Hilux, and a Bullion
And an ambulance and the escort...Yekpa !
