[Intro]
This beat ain't normal
Penthouse, aw-aw yeah

[Verse 1]
I like the way that you staring in the mirror
I'm just here, need no one to interfere
And I love how you keep that body fit
Got a cup, just in case you want a sip
I'm in love, I'm in love with your sin
Wanna hook up pon it damn I can't resist
Hit it one time, hit that one time
Be like, "Who's is this?"

[Pre-Chorus]
Baby, baby, baby, now we're way too curious
I wanna take a picture, take a picture
I'm in love with ya

[Chorus]
Can't you tell that I'm a fan
I'm a fan already
I'm a fan already
Can't you tell that I'm a fan
I'm a fan already
I'm a fan already

[Post-Chorus]
Yeah, you dancing in the mirror
I'm a fan already
I'm a fan already
I'm a fan, the way you dancing in the mirror
I'm a fan already
I'm a fan already
I'm a fan

[Verse 2]
To be transcribed...

[Pre-Chorus]
Baby, baby, baby, now we're way too curious
I wanna take a picture, take a picture
I'm in love with ya

[Chorus]
Can't you tell that I'm a fan
I'm a fan already
I'm a fan already
Can't you tell that I'm a fan
I'm a fan already
I'm a fan already

[Post-Chorus]
Yeah, you dancing in the mirror
I'm a fan already
I'm a fan already
I'm a fan, the way you dancing in the mirror
I'm a fan already
I'm a fan already

[Verse 3]
To be transcribed...

[Pre-Chorus]
Baby, baby, baby, now we're way too curious
I wanna take a picture, take a picture
I'm in love with ya

[Chorus]
Can't you tell that I'm a fan
I'm a fan already
I'm a fan already
Can't you tell that I'm a fan
I'm a fan already
I'm a fan already

[Post-Chorus]
Yeah, you dancing in the mirror
I'm a fan already
I'm a fan already
I'm a fan, the way you dancing in the mirror
I'm a fan already
I'm a fan already
I'm a fan
