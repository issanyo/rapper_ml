She say she wan try that she get the liver
But I go do her body work like a panel bitter
They see the high cglass, they feel the swagger

Until my homie tell me say she dey steal destiny
Girls want me to put them in the way of family
But the know the boy fly than a principality

Tin ba gbo ka ma ti sa kin to gbo rishika
Wait before you off pant, this thing is imposicant

Leave him alone karishika eehy. Sucking his blood
