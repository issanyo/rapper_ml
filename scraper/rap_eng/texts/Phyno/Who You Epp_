Married to the game, Olo'un mii ki n'sun
Fvck my ex-es, I don’t miss you

Who you epp? (Who you epp?)

Who you serve? (Who you serve?)

[Verse 1 - Wande Coal]
Sometimes, sometimes
Me I dey for road no stop signs
Why Niggas go dey hate me sometimes
We dey migrate to the sunshine
Who you epp? Who you epp?
Came from the streets did it for myself
You wan kill my rep, You talk say you epp
Who you epp? If I hear say you epp
Benz man shii, Bad man shii, DJ shii
Movement shii, fly-fly shii, that's my shii
O bloody, O messy
Fuck my ex-es, I dont miss you
All my ex-es I dont need you
Omo, I get my chic so, I dont need you
Do my things how we do now
Take me there, wanna go there
Wanna go seh, cannot go back
Take me 'cos that needing
I get that everyday (they don know!)

[Verse 3 - Phyno]
Heh! Bia, bia nwa
Nwa wey dey happen, Nwa wey dey sub
Okwa ikpuchalu’m isi ibulu’m kponye na Yaba left
I’m impressed, iji the key
Okwa ife n’ine ina amacha bu ka my pepper rest
You see your breast, I must confess
Out of umu asa n’ine nfugo so gi na agbanu first
Mana ya abakwana gi isi cos, me I no send
Cause imacha nyekwa g'oche, Heh!
The boy na achi ka ngige, icholu’m bia ni idide
Nkpachalu one ifite, my men ga atu na efife
Aga enye gi oso na efife, aga eriche gi na abani
Till igbagide gbagide gbagide kwa wefutelu anyi ya
Eze nnunnu aburo guy name
And ima na the flow si na chukwu oburo man-made
The boy strong, Hercules
Mr Alex, even your dog name na Hercules
