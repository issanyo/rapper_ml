[Verse: MYK]
Don't be nervous. Stay calm and ready
A time bomb is ticking and your heart is heavy
Close your eyes and open your minds
Let the butterflies in the pit of your stomach subside
This is life in the making
The roots of this will never be forsaken
But barriers were built for breaking
So keep moving it. Let your heart grip the beat
Driver's seat, ride the rhythm and start losing it
Spotlights, bright lights and neon
Rays of energy pour from backdrops and beyond
Music hits you so hard you can't blink or see on
A slave to the rhythm but still we reach freedom
Let it breathe, make it bang
Light a fire on the stage like Hendrix in acid rain
The most epik is the most high
That`s why I rep the flyest shit in the south side... Tukutz!
