[Intro: Zev]
I need an airbag
Save me from this melancholy that is driving me to death

[Verse 1: Juzo]
I’m detached in a sea of crowded noise
Excuses leak out from my soft reticent voice
The laughter in this clique’s suffocating my breath
They don’t seem to notice that I got up and left
Sometimes I wonder if I’m treasured in their memories
Or forgotten like an old worn rusty pair of sandals
Don’t think I have enough energy
To let these people that pretend like they care past the mantle
My true feelings have a secret code
This game of avoidance got the bleachers cold
Even though I wanna ramble to some foreign ears
I can’t find the strength to let my demons flow
Oh what have I become?
When things get difficult all I do is run
My tears won’t shed on the days that I weep
Tired of dejection, please let me sleep

[Hook: Zev]
I need an airbag
Save me from this melancholy that is driving me to death
I need an airbag
Keep my heart from bursting through my chest

[Verse 2: Juzo]
Lacerated by the thoughts inside of my gloom
As I dwell within the walls of a musty cocoon
Someday this pain will make me beautiful
Like the crocuses in winter waiting patiently to finally bloom
I guess that’s what I’d like to think
But really isolation has got me on the brinks
Of despondency, and honestly
I’d rather tune out from the world so don’t talk to me
My seclusion has turned me into rubble
Even when I’m happy there’s a sadness that is subtle
I love being alone but I hate being lonely
Always acting distant when I want people to know me
Tryna binge away the blues
Emptiness is home when I have nowhere else to go
Maybe I’m just scared of being bruised
So instead I intoxicate myself within my zone

[Hook: Zev]
I need an airbag
Save me from this melancholy that is driving me to death
I need an airbag
Keep my heart from bursting through my chest

[Bridge 1: Juzo]
I guess I’m all alone again
I guess I’m all alone again
I guess I’m all alone again
Once again (x2)

[Interlude: Zev]
Watch me bleed
Keep your love
Watch me bleed
Keep your love
Don’t get close to me

[Verse 3: Juzo]
Loneliness is where I can be safe
Loneliness has promised me that it’ll never change
Loneliness has always given me a place to stay
When everyone around me has slowly start to fade
Say, would they care if I was gone
Or am I just a ghost hiding deep within a song?
Solitude’s the only place for me
Where do I belong?

[Hook: Zev]
I need an airbag
Save me from this melancholy that is driving me to death
I need an airbag
Keep my heart from bursting through my chest

[Bridge 2: Zev]
Even after all this time
I’m still not used to the sadness deep inside
I need you
Yes I need you
My airbag

[Outro: Juzo]
I guess I’m all alone again
I guess I’m all alone again
I guess I’m all alone again
Once again

I guess I’m all alone again
I guess I’m all alone again
I guess I’m all alone again
Not again
