English:
When I fall, I laugh louder, wake up
When I fall, I'm higher cuz my name is HI
I'm in a place where there's music, Music is my life
Though I'm in a deep darkness, I shine I'm a STAR!

On clubs, in a distance and even on phone
Up to this moment when they hear my voice
A lot of tears and sweat flows
Remember that, you can't forget that

Turn it up raise your hands, raise 'em HI!
Close your eyes and let music and you be one
Right, at this moment say my name. HI
