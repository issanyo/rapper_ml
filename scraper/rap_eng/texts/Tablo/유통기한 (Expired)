[Verse 1]
Even if I look at the clock
I don’t have time, goodbye now

[Verse 2]
Even if I look at the calendar
I don’t have any memories now

[Chorus]
I’m afraid I’ll be a book that no one reads
Music that no one listens to anymore
I’m afraid I’ll be abandoned like a movie playing in an empty theater

[Verse 3]
Even if I look at the phone
I don’t have any relationships now
Even if I look into the mirror
In there, there’s no confidence now

[Outro]x2
I’m afraid I’ll be a book that no one reads
Music that no one listens to anymore
I’m afraid I’ll be abandoned like a movie playing in an empty theater
