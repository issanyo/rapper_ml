You left me paralyzed, no cure, no rehab for me
Funny that you got the nerve to keep asking me
How I’ve been
You’re the victor in this pageantry
But the only trophy you deserve, catastrophe
I’d rather we be dead to each other
No eulogies said for each other
No “Rest in Peace”s
The memories got my chest in pieces

I’m praying that your eyes are the first to go
The way they looked when you smiled
The way they opened and closed
And your nose, every single breath against my neck
And then your lips, every empty promise made and said
Please fade, fade to black
Please fade, fade to black
But the nightmares come back

Because your eyes, nose, lips
Every look and every breath
Every kiss still got me dying
Still got me crying

Because your eyes, nose, lips
Every look and every breath
Every kiss still got me dying
Still got me crying

Forget a promenade, let’s juggernaut
Down memory lane, leave no thought alive
To the slaughter house, I’m taking my pain
Time to sever my brain from my heart and soul
My knees are burning hot, but God is cold

I’ve been told, one day you’ll know
Too much of heaven’s a sin
After the show, it’s only hell that it brings
So take it slow and let time heal everything
They say that time flies, but you keep breaking its wings
You’ll never fade, fade to black
Please fade, fade to black
But the nightmares come back

Because your eyes, nose, lips
Every look and every breath
Every kiss still got me dying
Still got me crying

Because your eyes, nose, lips
Every look and every breath
Every kiss still got me dying
Still got me crying
You wish me well
You wish me well
I wish you hell

[Taeyang]
I never want to look into your eyes again
No, I never want to hear you breathe again
Let me go, let me go
Baby, tell me that it’s the end

[Tablo, Taeyang, Together]
Because your eyes, nose, lips
Every look and every breath
Every kiss still got me dying
Still got me crying
The tears drive me out of my mind

Because your eyes, nose, lips
Every look and every breath
Your kiss still got me dying
Still got me crying
Crying, crying
Fade out
