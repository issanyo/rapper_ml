[Intro: Tablo]
You got me feeling like
Ooh
You get me lifted like
Let's go

[Verse 1: Gallant]
These flies on my window are winners in a losing game
Dip, duck, roll, and hover
They barely see a season change

[Pre-Chorus: Gallant]
While you and me live like birds on a power line
Hands gripping, and our fingers fried
God bless those Northern lights
And our own devices, babe
Entropy multiplies
Clock's ticking and I'm mortified
'Cause in the back of my mind
In the back of my hemisphere

[Chorus: Gallant]
Baby, I want you to cave me in
So maybe I won't have to admit it
Baby, I want you to cave me in
So maybe I won't ask to forget it

[Verse 2: Tablo]
Love has either got you over heels or overdosed
It's got you off your feet or on your toes
It's got you out your seat or in your place
It's got you diggin' it or your grave
Love has got you mad about or just about mad
Got you in a crush or it's got you in a crash
What used to make your heart sing a hit, sing a smash
Will make you wanna hit, wanna smash
Everything that you had into pieces
But love becomes clear when in pieces
What you couldn't see and hear during peace is
Why a heart becomes ears in two pieces
Yeah

[Verse 3: Eric Nam]
Gravity makes wonders
But it doesn't seem to wait
Float like clouds on water
We're waves across an open plain

[Pre-Chorus: Eric Nam]
'Cause you and me live like birds on a power line
Hands slipping and our fingers fried
God bless those Northern lights
And our own devices, babe
Entropy multiplies
Clocks ticking and I'm mortified
'Cause in the back of my mind
In the back of my hemisphere

[Chorus: Eric Nam]
Baby, I want you to cave me in
So, baby, I won't have to admit it
Baby, I want you to cave me in
So maybe I won't ask to forget it

[Outro: Eric Nam, Gallant, & Tablo]
I want it, I do
(Girl, cave me in, I won't say it again, I want you)
I want it, I do
I want it, I do, do, do, do
(Girl, cave me in, I won't say it again, I want you)
I want it, I do
(Girl, cave me in, I won't say it again, I want you)
I want it, I do
I want it, I do, do, do, do
(Just cave me in)
Ooh yeah I, ooh yeah, I do
