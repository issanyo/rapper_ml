[Intro: Tablo]
Yeah
Mapthesoul.com baby
MYK, with yours truly, Tablo
We takin' it back
Way back
To da' back of da' bus
Back of the classroom

[Verse 1: Tablo]
Life is a mystery in all shapes, sizes, and angles
From crop circles to Bermuda Triangles
The fate of the world is shaking like bike handles
*In their final hour, even some demons die angels*
What's true, is true isn't what you think it is
When the real world is a bad dream like Incubus
Triple X, triple Z? It's the same damn thing
You get fucked if you're eyes are closed when the alarm rings

[Verse 2: MYK]
Sing, passin' the mic back and forth, forth and baaack
Broke MC's choke MC's who can't afford to rap
Or choose to stay hungry, I'ma stay hungry
Free fall, bounce back, like it was a bungee
I snap back like a slingshot, bring hot-ness
Yes, no stress, cleanin' up this mess
In this hip-hop-ness, I found my niche
Let that bitch, breathe

[Chorus: Tablo & *MYK*]
Ah
Remember rap, when it used to be fun as hell?
Remember rap, like it was with Big Pun and L?
*Remember rap, when it used to be fun as hell?
Remember rap, like it was with Big Pun and L?*
Remember rap, when it used to be fun as hell?
Remember rap, like it was with Big Pun and L?
*Remember rap, when it used to be fun as hell?
Remember rap, like it was with Big Pun and L?*

[Verse 3: Tablo]
Who cares about East or West or the dirty South
When you got no diamonds in your dirty mouth
It's a burning house, hip-hop going poof
No wonder everybody wants to raise the roof
I see proof everyday that seekin' heaven is bleak
I see proof everyday like Eminem in his sleep
The devil is deep, water kid and nobody is stoppin' ya
Slip a toe in
In you go like slavia

[Verse 4: MYK]
Silly rap sessions, thoughtless wordplay
Hip-hop nerds stay, home sketchin'
A colorin' book for the philosophers
I lost a verse and this is its half-assed rendition
I spit rhymes just to pass the time
And if life is just a brainstorm, then I'm a mastermind
Always last in line, cause I don't care enough
But when my turns comes, best believe that I tear shit up

[Intermission: Tablo & *MYK*]
Uh- that'cha tear shit up
Yeah
I tear shit up like a firecracker and poof
(MYK laughing)
*Nah, dude*
(Tablo laughing)
*I don't think, uh-*
Like a firecracker and poof
*I don't know about that one, haha*
I tear shit up like scissors, ye-
Like scissors
Tearing shit up, haha
*Yeeuh*

[Chorus 2: Tablo & MYK backing vocals]
This is for you kids, who don't wanna be a businessman
This is for you kids, who don't have a damn business plan
*I don't- I don't have one*
This is for you kids, who don't wanna be a businessman
*Or a doctor*
This is for you kids, who don't have a damn business plan
*Y-You got one?*

[Intermission: Tablo]
Never get one
Got stressed out, over the weekend
Damn, shit happened
And now I'm here to uh, let it out

[Verse 5: MYK]
Let me see two in the sky, guy, one for the livin'
Stay fly, high, one for the music in I
Two for the good life, keep the champagne sittin' in the freezer on a block of that cool ice
Stay nice, eskimo-cool flow
I say why you gotta be testin' a dude, yo?
Stop guessin' at clues, you'll be destined to lose
Yeah we fresh when we move, and we blessin' the booth

[Outro: Tablo]
Yeah, blessed in the booth
Like a minister
Using a pay phone- hahahaha...
Peace
