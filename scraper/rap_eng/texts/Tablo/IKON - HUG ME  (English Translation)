Just one time, for 10 seconds let me hug you

Were you surprised?
I'm drunk with the night’s emotions
Thinking about stuff and I came here
No need to be nervous, it's nothing important
Just listen first, I don't wanna hear anything from you
I know we’re friends and you're his girlfriend
Tomorrow and the day after that, I know we'll be friends
But as a friend to a friend, let's just talk
That's why I called you at this time, sorry
If a conversation is too much, just listen
I was trying to hold it in but I'm so frustrated
I'm about to get sick
You're his girl but I love, no I like you a lot

We’ve already come so far
I just quietly waited
Every night, pacing back and forth through the memories
Trying to throw away these feelings

Just one time, for 10 seconds, let me hug you
Just enough so it won’t ruin our friendship
Just enough so I won't have any regret

Just one time, before you go to him, let me hug you
Just enough so it won’t ruin our friendship
Just enough so I won't have any regret

I became like the people I hated the most
My head says no but I want you
As time goes by, these feelings get stronger
I try to hide it but I keep moving to my instincts
When I'm next to you, I'm a friend
When I’m alone, I'm a lover
I tried to get over you so I walked
On the street you and him walk on
But you're so perfect to me, like a dream
Like playing with water in the summer
You're a spring rain story to my drought-like life

My heart won't listen to me
I didn't know it was this bad
But I still feel so strongly, I'm a bit impatient
Who knows? I'll keep the door open

We've already come so far
I just quietly waited
Every night, pacing back and forth through the memories
Trying to throw away these feelings

Just one time, for 10 seconds, let me hug you
Just enough so it won't ruin our friendship
Just enough so I won't have any regret

Just one time, before you go to him, let me hug you
Just enough so it won't ruin our friendship
Just enough so I won't have any regret

This is how your embrace feels, it's very warm
Maybe it's because I love you
But you're so beautiful, you, who I can't have

This is how your embrace feels, it's very warm
If a love that can't ever be can still count as love
Will I feel better?

Just one time, for 10 seconds, let me hug you
Just enough so it won't ruin our friendship
Just enough so I won't have any regret

Just one time, before you go to him, let me hug you
Just enough so it won't ruin our friendship
Just enough so I won't have any regret

This is how your embrace feels, it's very warm
Maybe it's because I love you
But you're so beautiful, you, who I can't have
