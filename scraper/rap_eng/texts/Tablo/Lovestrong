What is love?
You'd say, “The answer”
I'd question mark that
With "No, that's not an answer"
I called it cancer
Even when the stars align and make you laugh
It ain't no milky way when even
'good luck' is half and half
Your glass was always half full
Mine was fully empty
Yeah I was a handful
You should have never held me
I'm such a bad example
I hope you never let me
Affect the way you handle your new love
Even true love is nothing but a game
No prize for second place
You lose you go insane
You get three hundred sixty five shots
But when the game is called
Ask spring, summer, fall, man
Winner takes all
So here’s to the losers
Take a shot, take a sip
This round is on the house
Yeah it’s hell of a kick
Take a bow, take a shot, take a sip
This round is on the house
The truth is one hell of a kick

C'mon now I'm taking my time
All these worries
Keep spinning inside my mind
Spinning inside my mind
When it comes I'm making it mine
Cuz nothing can hold me back
So I'll be doing fine
Yeah I'll be doing fine

I keep the love
I keep on loving
I keep the love
Yeah yeah
I keep the love
I keep on loving
I keep the love
Yeah yeah

I've come a long way
And it's safe to say
There is no other place
For me to face the day
Chase the grey away no dreams
In black and white
It seems that half my life has gone off
Track from bad advice
But I'm still dreaming of a better spot
Catch myself when I get caught on
What I never got
It took me several shots
Yeah I hit and miss
Was quick to give, then lessons
Learned on love and riddances
These menaces will constantly evolve
When love is gone it's like your just to
Lost to see at all
And through that hazy state is where we
Wait for peace of mind
It's a crazy way we say we search but
Never seem to find it
So here's to the future
Take a shot, take a sip
This round is on the house
Yeah it’s hell of a kick
Take a bow, take a shot, take a sip
This round is on the house
The truth is one hell of a kick

C'mon now I'm taking my time
All these worries keep
Spinning inside my mind
I'm stuck inside my mind
When it comes I'm making it mine
Cuz nothing can hold me back
So I'm doing fine
Yeah I'll be doing fine

Though I might fall, there's nothing
Weighing down my heart at all
My love goes strong
And I will keep on loving on and on

C'mon now I'm taking my time
All these worries keep
Spinning inside my mind
Spinning inside my mind
Whatever comes I'm making it mine
Cuz nothing can hold me back
So I'm doing fine
Yeah I'll be doing fine

Listen to your heart
And it will tell you no lies
Even if the days go by slow tides
Sometimes it's a swim to recovery
Find the hope inside the subtleties

Listen to your heart
And it will tell you no lies
Even if the days go by slow tides
Sometimes it's a swim to recovery
Find the hope inside the subtleties
