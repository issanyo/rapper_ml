[Verse]
I don't spit for the money, the playboy bunnies
I spit a 16 cuz I'm bored and it's funny
Kickin' emcees in the tummy, dunny, circus shit
I'm like a trust fund baby, I don't even need to work for it
I cyph on when I turn my mic on
The holy grail is mine, fuck monty python
The icon of rap, double-click to see the window to my soul
From Seoul to the corners of the globe
I'm infinite. A pool of spit when I'm done, you sink in it
Like a fattie in a skinny jean, I'm thick in it
Kickin' it down, obstacles and clowns
Breakin' up the atoms and the particles of sound

[Refrain]
Supreme Tablo. This was just for fun
Imagine when I really try. Muthafuckas run
Supreme Tablo. This was just for fun
Imagine when I really try. Muthafuckas run

[Outro]
Michelangelo had his Sistine
Tablo's got his 16
Michelangelo had his Sistine
Tablo's got his 16
