[Verse 1 : Tablo]
Tick tock, tick tock, and this time
When I set it off, can nobody stop it in time
Get off the block son
And get your sunblock when I rhyme
It's eternal sunshine of the spotless mind
From the top, rewind
Wrote rhymes in my dad's attic
Rap addict since Illmatic and I'm still fanatic
Never stop but when I'm stopped
I jog my mind around the writer's block
Till it's out of breath and asthmatic
I've had it with the paperchase, need I mention?
The rap game is all show and lyrical descension
Pretension, obsession for physical possession
I'll pay for your CD, but pay no attention
Ascension, I'll never lie to get it
Fake people piss me off like diuretic
To die or live it, you know the choice is yours
Just make sure that the voice is yours

[Hook]
Pe2ny, yeah he's breakin' it down
MYK, yeah I'm takin' it down
Supreme T, he's never fakin' the sound
Freestylin' steady shakin' the ground
DJ Pe2ny, yeah he's breakin' it down
MYK, yeah he's takin' it down
Supreme T, I'm never fakin' the sound
Freestylin' steady shakin' the ground

[Verse 2 : MYK]
Let me make the beat drop
And that's where I'm coming in
Unlock the truth in the booth and I'm runnin' in
Pe2ny drummin' in, listen to the drums, man
Listen to my voice and get your head spun, man
Eyes bloodshot but his tongue is on fire
Like a mind thought-blocked
But this buzz will inspire
We live in these rhymes
This life rippin' mics in the right direction
I'm guessin' it takes us higher
Temporary relief so I'm makin' it last
Takin' it fast, lacin' buds in raps
Tracin' raps with facts
Steppin' up the game but not reppin' for fame
Spittin' truth up in the booth
Then we settin' it in flames

[Hook]
Pe2ny, yeah he's breakin' it down
MYK, yeah I'm takin' it down
Supreme T, he's never fakin' the sound
Freestylin' steady shakin' the ground
DJ Pe2ny, yeah he's breakin' it down
MYK, yeah he's takin' it down
Supreme T, I'm never fakin' the sound
Freestylin' steady shakin' the ground
