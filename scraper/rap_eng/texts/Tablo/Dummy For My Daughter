[Verse 1: Snacky Chan]
Yeah yo yo..
This is for my baby Naeun what a pretty lady
Whenever I see your bright smile it makes me so happy
My dark heart changed Naeun is my sunlight
Just looking at her eyes you can tell that she's my baby
Gotta hustle even harder save money be smarter
I'd rather not eat healthy but I do for my daughter
A closet full of clothes, shoe closet full of Jordans
Gather teddy bears to the roof so you can hold them
Thank God every day for my angel
For some reason since your birth luck has followed me
I'm a king that means you a princess
Whoever tries to bully you is getting chin-checked
Is Snacky Chan your daddy? Is Snacky Chan your daddy?
If you're proud of your dad, then I've arrived at my destination
No joke that's my goal
Never knew a beautiful flower could bloom from a seed I planted

[Hook]
I'm a dummy, I'm a dummy, I'm a dummy for my daughter
I'm a dummy, I'm a dummy, I'm a dummy for my daughter
If you want it you can get it, just put in the cart
Premium steak everyday for my daughter
Live for my daughter, will kill for my daughter
That's the definition of a 딸바보

[Verse 2: Snacky Chan]
I'm a dummy for my daughter all the way, man I mean 100 percent
Because of you I fell in love deeply like the metro
From the beginning my blood was flowing in your veins
I have a few classic songs but you're the Mona Lisa
Head to toe in warm luxury clothes
Keep stress away from you so you can be more happy
Rental to lease to home purchase
Currently living in a basement that is why I'm in a rush
When you grow up get a real education
Have fun learning, my hope is your elevation
Came from the bottom, the dirt is where I'm from
Of course you're better than me, they call that evolution
When you grow up and become curious of who you are
Think of your father, remember nothing is impossible
Live for my, die for my, ride for my daughter
From you I get inspiration, Kim Naeun you're the best

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Snacky Chan]
It's Daddy talking
See I don't want you to forget so..
Repeat after me
I'm beautiful
(I'm beautiful)
I'm kind
(I'm kind)
I'm special
(I'm special)
Don't ever forget, understand?

[Verse 4: Tablo]
All that I have will be yours in time
The fortune for which I will have traded my youth
But you will also inherit the spite and hatred
Of the times that have targeted me
World full of sin
Power bought at the price of others' woes
Heed this
Your kings and queens are golden cowards
You're a flower that bloomed from concrete
You are not them
The pain that birthed you was a sacred aching
Yes, it was worth the suffering
Please remember
Even at your worst, you're the best of the best
When someone measures you with a crooked perspective
Fuck em
You are the sole ruler of you, Uh..
Yeah, I raise a lil heaven, Uh..
You were my first sight of heaven
God's payback for all my days of rebellin'
I used to raise hell. Now I raise a lil heaven
I love ya

[Hook]
