[Verse 1: InnoVater]
누구는 명문대를 졸업해
돈 벌기에 바쁘대
친구들과 부모님께
인정을 받을 때
나는 뭘 했나 요즘 자주 생각해
그래도 시간은 가 시계는 째깍대
그래 맞아 난 몰랐어
시간 가는 것도
알차게 남자답게
나의 삶을 사는 법도
아빠는 내게 말했어
너는 뭐 하나
제대로 한 게 없어
대체 어쩌려고 하냐
옛 여자 친구도 말했어
누구 말처럼 넌 천재인데
남들이 몰라주니
모르겠어 나도 내가 뭘 하는지
가끔은 의심 돼
내가 뭘 하려는지
그래서 잠시 멈춰서
뒤를 돌아보고 있어
지금 내 눈에 흐르고 있는 게
눈물인지 땀인지 난 잘 몰라서

[Verse 2: Lee Hi]
If you have a dream boy
어둠속에서 해매도
별이 되길 기도해
If you have a dream girl
Don’t let the world
Change who you are
You can be more than a TV star

[Verse 3: InnoVater]
난 TV에 나왔어
엄마 아빠를 위해서
날 부정해왔던 세상과
사람들 위에 서
말해 Yeah I did it boy
부정하던 사람들은
이젠 날 보고 웃으며 말해
You can do it boy
난 그냥 꿈꿔온 삶을 살면서
춤춰왔을 뿐
늘 자유롭고 파 움직였지 내 몸
나 행복하다면 노래를 하라던
엄마의 눈물로
세상을 적셔볼래 펑펑
늘 이기적인 내가 싫었어
내 기쁨이 가족에겐
큰 상처가 돼서
나 내가 싫었어
아빠의 아픔이여서
난 내가 싫었어
내가 내 아픔이었어
But you see me I’m on TV
그 아무리 아무도
나를 믿지 않았어도 해냈으니
I’m the boss
꿈 아래 선택 받은 놈
빛이 항상 따를 몸
Yes I’m the chosen one
Superstar the number one

[Verse 4: Lee Hi]
If you have a dream boy
어둠속에서 해매도
별이 되길 기도해
If you have a dream girl
Dont let the world
Change who you are
You can be more than a TV star

[Verse 5: InnoVater]
Everytime I look up in the sky
I see the stars and
I can hear my god says
This is who you are
Everytime I look up in the sky
I see the stars and
I can hear my god says
This is who you are
Everytime I look up in the sky
I see the stars and
I can hear my god says
This is who you are
Everytime I look up in the sky
I see the stars and
I can hear my god says
This is who you are

[Verse 6: Lee Hi & InnoVater]
Everytime I look up at the stars
They be telling me you are perfect
Just the way you are
Baby If you looking for the stars
멀지 않아 그 TV를 끄고
거울 속을 봐
Everytime I look up at the stars
They be telling me you are perfect
Just the way you are
Baby If you looking for the stars
멀지 않아 그 TV를 끄고
거울 속을 봐
Everytime I look up at the stars
They be telling me you are perfect
Just the way you are
Baby If you looking for the stars
멀지 않아 그 TV를 끄고
거울 속을 봐


Some graduate from top universities
And are busy making money
When they got acknowledged
By their friends and parents
I thought to myself, what am I doing these days?
But time keeps flowing, the clock keeps ticking
Yeah I didn’t even know time was ticking
I didn’t know how to live life
To the fullest like a man
My dad told me
“You can’t do a single thing right
What are you going to do?”
My ex-girlfriend told me
“People say you’re a genius
But why don’t others notice?”
I don’t know either, I don’t know what I want
Sometimes I doubt myself on what I really want
So I’ve stopped for a moment and looked back
Because I don’t know if it’s tears
Or sweat that’s flowing from my eyes right now
If you have a dream boy
Even if you’re lost in the darkness, I pray you’ll be a star
If you have a dream girl
Don’t let the world change who you are
You can be more than a TV star

I’m on TV for my mom and my dad
I’m standing on top of the world
And the people who turned me down
Tell me, yeah I did it boy
People who once turned me down
Are now smiling at me and saying
You can do it boy
I just lived my dream and danced along the way
My body was always freely moving
I’m gonna drench the world
With my mother’s tears that shed as she said
You do your music if it makes you happy
I always hated myself for being selfish
Because my joy became my family’s pain
I hated myself because I was my dad’s pain
I hated myself because I was my own pain
But you see me I’m on TV
I overcame even when no one believed in me
I’m the boss, the chosen one from under my dreams
The one that always has light, Yes I’m the chosen one
Superstar the number one

If you have a dream boy
Even if you’re lost in the darkness, I pray you’ll be a star
If you have a dream girl
Dont let the world change who you are
You can be more than a TV star

Everytime I look up in the sky
I see the stars and I can hear my god says
“this is who you are”
Everytime I look up in the sky
I see the stars and I can hear my god says
“this is who you are”

Everytime I look up in the sky
I see the stars and I can hear my god says
“this is who you are”
Everytime I look up in the sky
I see the stars and I can hear my god says
“this is who you are”

Everytime I look up at the stars
They be telling me you are perfect
Just the way you are
Baby If you looking for the stars
It’s not far away, turn off the TV and look in the mirror

Everytime I look up at the stars
They be telling me you are perfect
Just the way you are
(You are perfect stars)
Baby If you looking for the stars
It’s not far away, turn off the TV and look in the mirror
(Looking for the stars look in the mirror)

Everytime I look up at the stars
They be telling me you are perfect
Just the way you are
Baby If you looking for the stars
It’s not far away, turn off the TV and look in the mirror
