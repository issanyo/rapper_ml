[Hook: Kero One]
Have you ever seen an Asian kid, make a hit and do it quite like this
You ever seen an Asian cat, say a rap and spit it quite like that?
Have you ever seen an Asian kid, make a hit and do it quite like this
Yellow skinned rap reverends. veterans,  spit eloquent take two steps back

[Verse 1: Kero One]
It's that laundry mat,  liquor store
Rice rockets, pigeon hole
We pushed in kicked in, pitiful
What don’t kill you, its pivotal
That elephant in that awkward house
They reticent to talk about
These slanted eyes, those random lies
Media’s feeding us and walking out
He said I rap dope, but look like William Hung
That made me laugh yo what a joke, really was a silly one
But will he hung I mean hang without a username
Or talking to the hand of a million fans in the middle of a pavilion
An Asian man with a mic in hand this time not math subtracting
Accent having, fashion lacking, forget computer hacking
My future passion is lasting, rapping, make music classic
Captain I’m packing these beats
Best believe I’m going out blasting

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Tablo of Epik High]
Before I got sick on the mic I remember
I used to get picked on like a damn fender
A skinny asian boy has many names usually
Chink, fob, gook and of course Bruce Lee
But on a looseleaf i could unlearn all of that
So i wrote profusely and it turned into rap
Started burning on tracks and i caught flames
Now Epik High is the shit when you drop names
Like an unsigned hero making his way
I punched and kicked all labels away
Here to stay, hot like illegal
Cross a dating game and bungee, I drop hot singles

[Hook]

[Verse 3: MYK]
It's the year of the tiger, hands up!
For the one who paved the way, brother JK
Yeah we're all Drunken, only bangers are bumpin'
From far east to the world keep their fists pumpin'
This is the new new school we are the next shit
Resurrection of Bruce you fools are excess
Asiatic, Ill-matic, with no static
My voice is clear it grips your ears just like it's magic

And I thought that we over came
Some still silly really talk this way
Do I really have to double up and
Pull out the tricks of yesterday just to display?
That it's not a game we play
To prove that true is how we rap
I make this music cause I'm funkin' good at that

[Verse 4: Dumbfoundead]
It was the year 2000, no Asian kids around
None of em' ripping microphones, just timid sittin’ down
Along came a hero, his name was DFD
At the age of 14 he was killin' the LA scene
He hit the road doing shows, and met cats around the globe
Kero in the bay, Blo and MYK at Map the Soul
He later found that there were more of em', brothers of same origin
They saw his face on youtube and e-mails started pouring in
They exist, Asian kids, shredding rappers into bacon bits
Another chapter in the history books, but he knows that the next page is his
The pages turn, he waits his turn, just as he thought there he is
Chapter 2 now let's begin, the new face of Asian-Americans

[Outro]
Chinese, Korean kids put your hands up if your feeling this
Chinks, gooks, nips, put your fists up if your tired of it!
Black, Caucasian kids, throw your hands up if your feeling this
Chinks, gooks, nips, put your fists up if your tired of it!
Latino, Filipino kids, put your hands up if your feeling this
Chinks, gooks, nips, put your fists up if your tired of it!
