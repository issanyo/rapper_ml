Here Come The Regrets 의해 에픽하이 가사[Verse 1: Lee Hi]
Honest to God
I don’t remember why
I woke up on the floor
’bout a quarter after four
Must have been something
Cuz you keep on calling
Telling me we’re done
I was tryin’ to have some fun

[Verse 2: Tablo]
Ever since you left, been rainy days
I’ve been a fuckin’ mess
Wakin’ up in a sweat
Memories a haze
Still faded and drunk as shit
Been anywhere that trouble is and God is not
Girl, I confess
I’ve been crossin’ off death wishes
Like I got a kick-the-bucket list
Lookin’ for that fast love
Been givin’ out the same pain that you dealt out
Can you blame me for being heartless
When I had my fuckin’ heart ripped out?
Flip out till I’m kicked out
Cuz I taste you in every shot that I take down
But I feel so hollow
What I’m trying to say is I’m so…

[Hook: Lee Hi]
Sorry
Baby, things got crazy
I know I know I know
I know I know I know

[Chorus: Lee Hi]
Here come the regrets
Here come the regrets
Here comes the
I wish I hadn’t done it
I wish I hadn’t said it
I wish that I could take it all back

Here come the regrets
Here come the regrets
Here comes the
I wish I hadn’t done it
I wish I hadn’t said it
I wish that I could take it all back
Here comes the…

[Verse 3: Mithra Jin, Tablo]
Where was I?
What did I do?
Who with?
When did I get here and why?
Man, I’m clueless
Regrets?
I got a few…
Thousand
I blame the city
Blame the view
The music’s too damn loud and…
Look around
Look inside and out back
Smile at the world
Get a frown back
Is it me?
The whole fuckin’ town’s mad
Full of ratfuckers and no mousetrap
I found that it’s a sound fact
If you put your money where your mouth at
You’re either gonna choke or be a mute
I’d rather put my soul in a brown bag

[Refrain #2: Tablo, Mithra Jin]
God I know you’re up there (yeah)
God I know you’re up there (yeah)
God I know you’re up there (yeah)
God I know you’re up there
God I know you’re up there
But I needed You down here

[Hook: Lee Hi]

[Bridge: Lee Hi]
Hand to god
I swear I don’t remember how it started
Must have been the blow
It sure was alcohol related
Layin’ here tremblin’
Paranoia ragin’
Tryin’ to keep my sanity
While I’m so medicated (Ohhh)
Ouu, I knew

[Outro: Lee Hi]
Here come the regrets
Here come the regrets
Here comes the-
I wish I hadn’t done it
I wish I hadn’t said it
I wish that I could take it all back

Here come the regrets
Here come the regrets
Here comes the-
I wish I hadn’t done it
I wish I hadn’t said it
I wish that I could take it all back (take it all back)

Ouu, ouu, ouu
Here come the regrets
