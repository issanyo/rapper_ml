All causes and all effects
No college shit necessary to acknowledge it
Some call it love and some call it sex. opposites
Call it what you want but with one touch
And you're gone so call in sick
Human politics from whispered hushes
And distant crushes
Mental fits breakin' pencil tips and inkin' brushes
Simple rushes
God makes man and this is the devil's
Finishing touches
From dukes to duchesses and kings to queens
From dust to dust this is the sinful theme
The scene for crack fiends and gun-packin' teens
High on vaccines magazines and saccharine
From dukes to duchesses and kings to queens
From dust to dust this is the sinful theme
The scene for crack fiends and gun-packin` teens
High on vaccines magazines and saccharine
