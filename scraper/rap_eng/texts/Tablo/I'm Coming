(Ft. Tablo)
1. The strength that still keeps me going
The reason that I hunger for
Is the fear deep in my heart
The voice that can be heard every time I feel like fainting
Now is not the time to rest, don’t forget the hard times
The sound that awakens my weary body
It’s what you wanted; don’t forget the promise you made
I fix my rough breathing once again and I go
Rain is coming down through the rooftop
Rain is coming down again, soaking everything
Rain is coming down and it won’t stop
It’s too hot, it won’t stop
2. Let me tell you the story
My heart that feels like it’s about to stop is still running
My stretched legs and worn out shoulders become alive again
Once again standing tall
Everybody get ready tonight
Me and my boys on a ride
Smelling feeling so right
You know how we do it
Must get it together tonight with my moves real tight
Make sure I come with the best of the best of the best come on
Rain is coming down through the rooftop
Rain is coming down again, soaking everything
Rain is coming down and it won’t stop
It’s too hot, it won’t stop
Tablo, go go, let’s go!
Turn up the volume and with a fierce look of a rough storm in your eyes
Rain~ with a worldwide sound
Seoul City, Beijing to Tokyo (ho!)
With hands up across the world
With rain rain rain, flowers bloom on thirsty ground
Say ho! (ho!) It’s VIP
