Hangul | Korean Original

[Verse 1: G.Soul]
Oh, no, 시간이 갈수록 널, yeah
Like a black hole, 출구도 없이 깊어져
우리 둘, girl, baby
산소도 없는 우주 한가운데처럼
우리 어디론가, 어디론가
들리는 글자들은 마치 중력처럼
우릴 가두는데 우린 마치

[Chorus: G.Soul]
Fire in the water, we are burning wild and free
Just me and you, me and you
Fire in the water, they know nothing ’bout our love
Just me and you, just me and you
Fire in the water
Fire in the water
Fire in the water
Fire in the water

[Verse 2: Tablo]
Have you ever loved someone to death
재가 되도 우린 안 식겠지
다짐했지만 시간이 test
In fact 불씨가 죽기 전엔 누구나 완벽한 매치
붙기만 하면 냈지, 때론 빛, 때론 화
돌아보니까 now I can see that is why
서로에게 데었다고 하는 건
그만큼 사랑했다는 걸 빗대는 말
어쩔 수 없나 봐
언제나 불협화음, 이 잔혹한 lullaby
그만두자, 이젠 너도 지치기 싫지?
I made the bed for you, you can ZZZ in peace

[Chorus: G.Soul]
Fire in the water, we are burning wild and free
Just me and you, me and you
Fire in the water they know nothing ’bout our love
Just me and you, just me and you
Fire in the water
Fire in the water

[Bridge : Tablo]
몸과 마음을 지폈던 그 추억에
뜨거웠던 만큼 손댈 수 없네
지난날의 기억들이 뿌옇게
재가 되어 눈꽃처럼 이 도시에 수놓네
Have you ever loved someone to death?
Have you ever loved someone to death?
죽도록 사랑하겠다는 게 현실이 된 것 뿐인데
손 떼기 어렵네

[Chorus: G.Soul]
Fire in the water, we are burning wild and free
Just me and you, me and you
Fire in the water, they know nothing ’bout our love
Just me and you, just me and you
Fire in the water
Fire in the water
Fire in the water
Me and you baby
Fire in the water
Burning wild and free

English Translation

[Verse 1: G.Soul]
Oh no, as time goes by
Like a black hole
Deep down both of us girl baby
Like the center of space without oxygen
Where we are and where we are
As you hear
We grab us like gravity

[Chorus: G.Soul]
Fire in the water
We are burning wild and free
Just me and you
Me and you
Fire in the water
They know nothing ’bout our love
Just me and you
Just me and you
Fire in the water
Fire in the water
Fire in the water
Fire in the water

[Verse 2: Tablo]
Have you ever loved someone to death?
We will not be ashamed if we go to ashes
I promised, but time tested
In fact, everyone is a perfect match for the fire
I just wanna get it, sometimes light, sometimes mad
Looking back I can see that
To say to each other
I love you that much
I can not help it
Always dissonant, this cruel lullaby
Let’s quit it
Do not you want to get tired now?
I made the bed for you
You can ZZZ in peace

[Chorus: G.Soul]
Fire in the water
We are burning wild and free
Just me and you
Me and you
Fire in the water
They know nothing ’bout our love
Just me and you
Just me and you
Fire in the water
Fire in the water
Fire in the water
Fire in the water

[Verse 3: Tablo]
In the memory of my body and mind
I can't touch you
The memories of the past
They are ashes and painted in this city like snowflakes
Have you ever loved someone to death?
Have you ever loved someone to death?
I’m gonna love you to death
It’s a reality, but it’s hard to break

[Chorus: G.Soul]
Fire in the water
We are burning wild and free
Just me and you
Me and you
Fire in the water
They know nothing ’bout our love
Just me and you
Just me and you
Fire in the water
Fire in the water
Fire in the water
Me and you baby
Fire in the water
Burning wild and free
