Dear TV, desensitize me
Give me more genocide please
The world is your aphrodisiac so you stay turned on
Every minute, every second I breathe
You weaponize greed, kill me with incessant I needs
Got me checkin' out those and checkin' out these
Mainstream me, disinfecting my breed
I'm looking for nirvana but you Geffenize me
Point me to the skies till heaven's eye bleeds
Anoint me with your lies then divinize me
If heaven is a show, well, televise me
But I won't lie my way in, no fakin' IDs
I'll die standing. Try breaking my knees
I'll do a handstand like I'm breakin'. Now freeze
Don't act like you know me cause you recognize me
You sell my record not me
