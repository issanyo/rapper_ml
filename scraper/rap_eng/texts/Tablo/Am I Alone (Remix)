[Hook] x2
Am I alone
Am I alone
Am I alone
Am I alone
That's what this feels like
That's what this feels like
That's what this feels like
That's what this feels like

Aye, cause I did it all for Hip-Hop, Hip-Hop

X2
It's for Hip-Hop, Hip-Hop
All for Hip-Hop, Hip-Hop
My life for Hip-Hop, Hip-Hop

[verse 1]
How many shrooms before this world looks big enough
How many pills before I ain't really wakin' up
How many people talk about me and don't know me
Still talk shit and then act like we're homies
How many fools scared of telling me the truth
Fuck their teeth up to say they got a crooked tooth
Don't come at me, and say some homo shit like dog
I'm crooked too, I'll have my little homies straight snatch you out your roots
It's all cool though, warm menudo
And I'mma eat beats til I can move a sumo
Go to Mars with these lines coked out like Bruno
Walkin' the streets of K-town with my homie Lino
Always used to see Uno in his wheelchair
Thinking it's a Hardley Davidson, Davidson, Davidson, Davidson
And it's fuck the world like she's P dot Anderson
If this is the matrix then fuck it I'm Mr. Anderson
Blue pill red pill take them both and then see which one hits me first
I'm moving through these people steady tryna snatch a purse
And when I do I give it back cause I can't think of nothing worse
Then your worst enemy giving you back your purse
I'm on drugs, yeah fuck it your right
I'm on drugs in the daytime and even tonight
Get some issues of your own, I just wanna deal with mine
Get some issues of your own, and lemme live my life

[Hook] x2
Am I alone
Am I alone
Am I alone
Am I alone
That's what this feels like
That's what this feels like
That's what this feels like
That's what this feels like

Aye, cause I did it all for Hip-Hop, Hip-Hop

X2
It's for Hip-Hop, Hip-Hop
All for Hip-Hop, Hip-Hop
My life for Hip-Hop, Hip-Hop

[Verse 2]
Some days I don't care enough
The world stopped turning, and I started throwing up
I'm looking down thinking up can't put me down
I got the ground feeling like a cloud
Yeah I'm in the spot like a tick on a cow
I just wanna change a little bit, but don't know how
You know, I'm just a fiend can I get a few notes
But now music ain't enough to keep hope
So now I keep rope dangling from the ceiling
Just so I don't waste time when I get this feelin'
I'm tryna kill time and put it underground
Where I've been livin' eatin' and sittin'
In the land of the unforgiven where I've been driven
To kill beats and leave them missin', missin' and leave them missin'
Trippin' on these people, like God will they ever listen
I'm trippin' on these people, like God will they ever listen

[Hook] x2
Cause I' alone
Cause I'm alone
Because of Hip-Hop
Because of Hip-Hop
Because of Hip-Hop my life is so beautiful

[Outro]
I need weed, I need shrooms
I need coke, I need acid
Can you pass it
