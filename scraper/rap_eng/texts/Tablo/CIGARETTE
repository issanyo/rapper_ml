[Intro: Miso]
Smoke up a glimpse of heaven
Smoke up a glimpse of heaven

[Verse: Miso]
I smoked 2 packs 'till the night
Sip on red wine, I fall back
Can't stop distraction
I can't see a thing
Laying with you I feel like
Moving clouds high in the sky
It's been too long since
I realized you're real

[Pre-Chorus: Miso & Offonoff]
Two hearts come together
We were truly there
I fall down. Then I fall down
Puff of Heaven
I feel like I'm in a daydream
I go up. Then I go up

[Chorus: Miso & Offonoff]
I could, I could, be there for you
I could, I could, be the one to
I'd be, your cigarette
I would, I would, be your light and
I would, I would, shine you bright
Oh I wish, I'll be your last

[Bridge: Miso]
Smoke up a glimpse of heaven
Smoke up a glimpse of heaven

[Verse: Tablo]
She's got the dance floor hella lit. Then
She steps out for a cigarette
And, I've been prayin' all night
Like God- she gives life to my world with a "Can I get a light?"
Ignite a match
She leans in to catch it
We're, the only spark in the dark like a chandelier
With no ceiling but the sky
As the smoke from her lips bleeds into the atmosphere
No ashes here, no dust
This moment is forever
Even though each puff will take us further from together
She'll have, me until the very last drag
Come to think of it, love is like a cigarette
Burning at the tip of it, but quick to burn out
Like a cigarette, it may get you sick
But you'll never get sick of it
So light one up now

[Chorus: Miso & Offonoff]
I could, I could, be there for you
I could, I could, be the one to
I'd be, your cigarette
I would, I would, be your light and
I would, I would, shine you bright
Oh I wish, I'll be your last

[Verse: Offonoff]
I want you addicted to me
I was one of your cigarettes
The smell of your pastel breathing
Just makes me love you even more
My love is on fire

[Chorus: Miso]
I could- I could- be there for you
I could- I could- be the one to
I would- I would- be your light and
I would- I would- shine you bright

[Chorus: Miso & Offonoff]
I could, I could, be there for you
I could, I could, be the one to
I'd be, your cigarette
I would, I would, be your light and
I would, I would, shine you bright
Oh I wish, I'll be your last

[Outro: Miso & Offonoff]
I could, I could, be there for you
I could, I could, be the one to
I'd be, your cigarette
