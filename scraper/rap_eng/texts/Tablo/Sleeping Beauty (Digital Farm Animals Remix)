[Verse 1: Tablo]
The high that you’re giving me is coming so strong (coming so strong)
Head up in the clouds it could poke the ozone (poke the ozone)
The world is a wake-up call away from the end
Till then, we’ll find peace in this bed like we’re Yoko and John

[Verse 2: Tablo]
There’s no coming home when you’re not there
Cause together is alone when we‘re not a pair
Girl, my love is timeless and colorblind
I will love your black, love your brown and your white hair-

[Refrain: Fukase]
After all this time
After all these vibes
After all these highs
We’re still on this ride
Never wanna say goodbye
You brought me back to life
And forever it’s just us
No more you and I

[Pre-Chorus: Fukase]
Never off just on
Opposite of wrong
If it was you and me against the world
I’d still like our odds
Please don’t ever close your eyes on me
My sleeping beauty (yeah)
My sleeping beauty
My sleeping beauty
(Yeah, yeah)
My sleeping beauty

[Chorus: Fukase]
I gotta know now if you’re
You’re really down cause
Where there’s smoke there’s fire
I just hope you realize
That you know I believe
In a thing called destiny
So please don’t
Please don’t
Please don’t
Don’t sleep on me

[Refrain: Fukase]
After all this time
After all these vibes
After all these highs
We’re still on this ride
Never wanna say goodbye
You brought me back to life
And forever it’s just us
No more you and I

[Pre-Chorus: Fukase]
Never off just on
Opposite of wrong
If it was you and me against the world
I’d still like our odds
Please don’t ever close your eyes on me
My sleeping beauty (yeah)
My sleeping beauty
My sleeping beauty

[Refrain: Fukase]
After all this time
After all these vibes
After all these highs
We’re still on this ride
Never wanna say goodbye
You brought me back to life
And forever it’s just us
No more you and I

[Outro: Fukase]
Never off just on
Opposite of wrong
If it was you and me against the world
I’d still like our odds
Please don’t ever close your eyes on me
My sleeping beauty
