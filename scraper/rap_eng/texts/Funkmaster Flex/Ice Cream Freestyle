[Intro: Mike Tyson (Canibus)]
Get acquainted to the one and the only
The future, hip-hop king
Forever, the Canibus
(The Funkmaster Flex is coming!)

[Canibus]
For all you niggas saying that my shit is sick
Just imagine the 90% of my brain that I ain't even used yet
Take a deep breath quick, suck in as much air
As my lungs will permit, then I start to kick that shit
I been getting busy before the planets started to turn
Before the bees, the birds and Adam and Eve occured
Prior to all creation in other words
When the female egg will merge with the man's sperm
I stand firm, my words burn through your exterior
They eat away at your interior, I'm superior
While you only pretend to be, I can double my density
From three-sixty degrees to seven-twenty instantly
Six, multiplied by five by four by three by two then one
Go head and calculate the sum
The time has cometh, I was summoned to punish
Motherfuckers with mouths that runneth over with rubbish
When I come through, niggas stand stiller than statues
Cause if I have to, I'll battle your whole rap crew
Then I'll attack you with words that's absurd
And rip your fucking skin off just to get on your nerves
