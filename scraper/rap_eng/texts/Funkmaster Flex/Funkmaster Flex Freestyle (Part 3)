[Intro]

[Verse 1]
Don't even know if summer gon' feel me
So many sides to a nigga
I wonder who's the real me
Tired of fightin'
Tired of always trying to enlighten
Hit the blunt that I am lightin'
To catch a spark cause I'm writin'
Some shit that'll cause a riot
Or make a war go quiet
Make a fat cat diet
Make the square bitch try it
Make a cheapskate buy it
Tell me who as high as this
Balenciaga kicks for kicks
Tell me who fly as this
Effortless, got dressed quick
You niggas stress at this
An hour on your outfit and
You still can't impress a bitch
I cruise through the city so mean
Gangster lean, with no promethazine
So obsessed with cream
I done hit the lottery in my dream like four times
Took a minute but I burst on the scene in '09
Now tell these hoes meet me and please be on time
She come up out the jeans, and it seems she want mine
For her unborn child
Girls gone wild meets black girl lost
She got the type of body, piss fat girls off
This ain't love dove, this lust
Do you know how fast that wears off
Let me take you back to queens
Where a nigga was a king, uncrowned
Country boy, new kid in town
Ran the streets after sundown
Hit the spots you wouldn't come around
Same block that Sean Bell was gunned down
Told that hatin' ass cop harrasin' me cause I am black
"You ain't have to do that man like that
The nigga ain't even do a crime, yet you squeeze 50 times"
He turned to me with a smirk "51 to be exact", damn
Cole world, no cupid
Got drama with these niggas fronting like they so ruthless
Ok I am supposed to like your record
Cause you got a little record
Tell me do that make you real
Or just real fuckin' stupid
Nickel and Dime nigga
Came back with the hustle but get with the times nigga
You live in rewind nigga
Real niggas believe in me
Cause ain't nobody seein' me
And the way I shine is intended to blind niggas
And I am ghost
Disappear like Copperfield in the six
Switch gears and cop a feel for your bitch
Yeah that yellow bone thing, that's my honey
Everytime my fucking telephone ring it's about some money
And you know that, nigga
You know that

[Outro]
Nobodies feelings getting hurt, nobody getting mad
