[Verse One: Drayz]
Ayo bust the new layout, shit's way out so come and get it
And rock wit it, ayo Flex they on your diddick

Biggity back up on your set now let me begin
Another new year, you know my crew's here to make a killing
That's how we feeling
We Trump tight and now we Top Billin'

Full time shine
Riggity rocking rough rhymes cause I'm out to get mines
So, spread the word through your borough

Bats and gats
Busting lyrical caps to make your whole team collapse

[Verse Three: Nocturnal]
Yo the sky's the limit

That'll burst every vessel
In your brain cell muscle

Under street lights smoking Kryptonite
In the Philly
My style is Free like Willy
