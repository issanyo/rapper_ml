[Verse 1: Chinx Drugz]
All of them niggas complaining
Tell from the second I came in
I done been through mo' shit
Po shit to the top, now I’m faded
I don’t give a fuck where a nigga been, where a nigga going
Or what kind of shit he been through (yay)
Watch niggas ball, shit I couldn’t score
I done sat up on the bench too
Now a nigga fly by (by), fly jumping out the drive right (right)
Haters see me when I hop out (what?)
When a nigga did his state bid
Was the only time I copped out (copped out, yay)
(I’m askin' God questions, what we fighting for?)
(A nigga lost his name, what you crying for?)
Rock bottom, not going up
Fuck slowing up, I’m drinking (yay)
3 hoes, all 4 of us, I’m thinking (yay)
Know some niggas at the bottom and they still in it
Ask yourself, nigga really?

[Verse 2: French Montana]
Armed and dangerous
Rolled up blazed with the angel dust
Murder one homicide when they came to us
We came with the bail when they came with cuffs
Fame and trust – it don’t mix, like oil in the water
Feds on my door while I’m boiling the water
Need those chips, Michael in the fourth quarter
When you getting money fast life’s getting shorter
Nigga hit yo' head then nigga go and mop 'em
Nigga play Batman then go robbin'
Looking at my rap sheet, nigga won’t argue
Niggas talk a rap beef, nigga no problem
Coming from my head, just my God on me
Pussy and the bread, keep 'em calling me
Money in the bag, nigga calling me
But you pussy ass crackas don’t follow me
Now I’m talkin bout 500 dirty on my day like
Them young niggas hit you on the daylight
Young nigga tote that nina
Niggas turn on you, they ain't playin' right
Hundred thousand with a cross in the middle
Playing both sides with a cross in the middle
R.I.P. with a cross in the middle
HAAAH! (Ask yourself nigga, really)
