Of the Funkmaster Flex
Aiyyo Flex this is Busy Bee man, and I ain't goin for that
I heard Volume I, I heard Volume II
It is now to do Volume III, with Busy Bee
And we gotta do it somethin like this

Ahh yeah that's the way it goin down
Now this is how we did it way back in the days
It was all about peace and love and happiness at the Latin Quarters
All up in the Disco Fever, all uptown in the Boogie Down
At the T-Connection, and then we should come on down to Union Square
And play at the Roxy's, oh we just had a good time up there
And it was goin down like this, we had all the DJ's all the MC's
All the unity, kickin it like this
And now we gon' do it somethin like this, Flex c'mon

Now throw your hands in the air, and wave em like you just don't care
And if you wanna rock with Busy Bee, scream it out and say ohh yeah!
Ohh yeah, don't stop y'all, ah don't stop y'all, you're lookin good y'all
