[VERSE]
It's been a long time
I shouldn't have left you
Without a hot rhyme to sex to
Think of how many rap rappers she slept to
Well I'm back sorry I kept you
I know that you wished to be like the clean bitch
The nicest female solo wrist
So you sit by the radio hope I comin' on soon
When you hear Flex pump up the volume

[OUTRO]
It ain't no more to it
Go 'head Big Kap
