[Verse]
I feel like something special 'bout to happen
Queens nigga but the meetings be up in Manhattan
Move the pack fast, Usain Bolt quick
Re-up, then to freakanother one, bulk shit
We should have the hood Olympics, a cook off
Let's see who's coke is terrific, and who is gifted
With the coffee pot, baking soda, cookie jar
That will seperate the hustler's from the rookies, y'all
I knew enough spanish not to get jerked when i wanted work
Plus plus, plus I let my gun go off Berzerk
My cousins in the big houses, never had job niggas 'they was into murdering kidnapped and robbed niggas
I used to rhyme as a hobby in my building lobby
Fucking up ounces, take it back to quaters then
Whole sales was starkim or even Shawn Watermen
Fast foward got locked for a shooting
Hit sparfit, back when latin kings first recruiting
Locked in a zone, mind seperate
Guidance counselor, went to school with a weapon
Not for protection - but to show it off
But i would really use it
The power of the gun it gave me strength, i would abuse it
Never ever ever thought i would make it out of music
Started writing rhymes hard at the vision of youth
Locked up, reading golden's books
Expanded my imagination, i got creative with the pen though
Started writing rhymes about the streets, that was temple
My persona, identified hood pride
Logical, order of the blocks and the streets and the obstacles
Shit work when you think about it
I mean i'm still getting money when you think about it
Yeah, rap! Probably saved my life twice with it
Let's get nice with it, let's forget all the ice with it
Forget the accolades and other wild things i did
I was a wild kid, i would've ran up in your crib
Remember War Report, C-N-N legacy
Hip Hop Pedigree, rhymes is a felony
Student of the game I take responsibility
Give me tranquility, so niggas can't belittle me
I still do what i do like past due
This album's from the heart, sorta felt that I had to
True shit, I do the new shit
And the true school shit, wild with the deuces
Little guns for the little duns, y'all are
Back in the leather couch, Marijuana
Eyes vision clearer, I love who i see in the mirror
I couldn't make that clearer
Try to compete with a real street nigga doing street shit
You is soft as Aloe Vera
You's moissanite, fake jewellry niggas faker than they chain
The audio the mix show i still obtain
Queens legend, it's nas then it's me
And anyone that disagree i smack 'em out they misery
16 years blood sweat and my tears
I wanna do a last report for everyone that cares
Or maybe i'm just anxious like a dude for his settlement
Maybe people don't think that CNN is relevant
Uphill battle, when you're still rich
And your first hit date back to '96
