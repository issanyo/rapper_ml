[Verse 1]
Uh, uh, uh
Niggas gettin' trampled on, what's all the fuss about?
Suckin' my dick so hard, I'm bustin' in they mouth
And then I snuff 'em out, four to the mid', fuck what I did
With no regard for a bid, ripped you up, while you with your kid
Slid into the shadows, 'cause I'm dark like that
I bark like that, jet black, but I spark like that
Where are they at, when I get thirsty, shit
Ain't a nigga strong enough to stand the worst it gets
Bits and pieces are all that's that left
Niggas so scared to death, they hold they motherfuckin' breath
'Til I pass, 'cause they ass, and I smelled em
I-S-P-E-L-L-E-D T-H-E-M, I spelled them
To make me have to swell one, eye up, lump up one head
Catch a body with the shottie, pump up one dead
Red alert, niggas is about to get hurt, do work
To skirts, like a jag on the murk, erf
Night time is the right time for creepin'
Vandalize your crib, rape your wife while she's sleepin'
I been off the deep end, since I was semen
That's why now, I'm such a motherfuckin' demon!
Screamin, my bloody head off, shit on my mind I gots to get off
Can't even hold a joint, lest I let off
A couple of rounds, from the big three pound, seven
That's about eleven hundred as of now
How can one man kill so many
Innocent people before the age of twenty
Life ain't worth a penny in, my book faggot
That's why I took faggot shit, I'm a crook faggot
Fat new leather jacket, I bag it
Along with the jewels smackin' tools out the hands of fools
On the strength that they don't know what they holdin'
Niggas called me Taylor cause the way that I be sewin'
Shit up 'cause I get up, off my ass and skate
Makin more moves than U-Haul, from state to state
I speak the great, and if a nigga tells you different
You turn around you ask the nigga, "The fuck is you be sniffin'?"
Cause when it come to riffin', I am the riff-raffin'
Gots to say nothin', niggas know they get had

[Outro]
