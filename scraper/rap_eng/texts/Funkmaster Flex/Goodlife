Yeah, funk flex
60 minutes of funk, volume 4 baby

[verse 1]
Seven days of working no breaks
Gotta take a day off to unwind
It gives me, time to get away
A little time to ease my mind, my mind, my mind

1-   forget about your worries
Save all problems for tommarow
Tonight i'm just trying to have a good time
Dj play, the easy way
The music right, do it to to me
Don't you wanna live the good life?

2-   (the good life)
No stress, good friends in
(the good life)
Lay back relax, its the
(the good life)
Good love, no messes the
(the good life)
Wanna live in the good life

[verse 2]
Dancing with a glass of champagne
Or maybe chardinay, keep it feeling good all night
See so many happy people on the floor
Just leave your problems at the door, the door

Repeat 1
Repeat 2
Repeat 2

Will dance, the night away

All though i hate i have to go and face another day
I'm gonna get my grove on and party, party

Repeat 1
Repeat 2
