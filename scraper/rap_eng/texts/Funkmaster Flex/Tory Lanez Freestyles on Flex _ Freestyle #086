[Intro: Tory Lanez & Funkmaster Flex]
Ayo, it's the Sauce Kid official, Tory Lanez
You know I came here to respect all the legends
To show my respect and hop on the Funk Flex, legendary
You know how I always wanted to do this shit
Hot 97, you know how we rockin'
Shout out my nigga True Life, I'm [?] in the buildin', you heard?
You know what it is (mm-hm)
Funk Flex, Ciroc Studios, Tory Lanez is here (yeah)
Which is here
I'm thinkin', instrumental is— let's— let's get to it?
Let's— let's— yeah, let's get it
Let's do it ERNZ
Turn it up a little bit
Yeah, uh!

[Verse: Tory Lanez & Funkmaster Flex]
Tory Lanez got the block on whiplash
The cops on draw quick fast so my shit stashed
I keep a big fifth stashed in the whip dash
Trip, catch six in a second like quick flash
Bitch pass if you ain't lettin' the clique smash
I switch tags just so I could let my chicks brag
Niggas whole swag ain't half my chicks bag
No jokes, those'll get you smoked like quick drag
I click fast then bang your bitch ass
Brain from your chick in the whip that I just crashed
Sound wild like Tory puttin' a thou down
Tryna make a bitch bow down in the chow chows
Don't you know I sing songs with a mink on
And have chicks dripping like the sink in their string thong?
I ding dong ditch bitches when the fling gone (ha ha!)
With a mink on and four fingers that my rings on
Quick drawin' like you don't know where my dick going
Like I ain't been up in your chick dome since the flip phones (pow!)
My ice rocky, nice jocky
So much maple leaf money, niggas think I'm playing ice hockey
I'm that fly type, move through the night cocky
Bitch, I look so good, even the dykes watch me
I'm on Dyckman with a bad lightskin
Chain rain so much water they think we 'bout to have lightning
When I spit, niggas think I'm in that lab fightin'
Niggas think that I'm left hooking and I'm jab writin'
One thing is, I ain't in that lab writin', nigga everything is off top
Word to my bald spot
I used to have to stash work in my broad spot
Cops came, had to stash work in her bra strap
Phone calls and my connect is just a call drop
We don't count down on those, that's a ball drop
Come on akh, pretendin' y'all niggas on block
Twin fives put like ten of y'all niggas on shots
We could do it however y'all niggas wan' rock
Make this shit pop like oil in a chrome pot
And it don't stop
I'm not a picture painter but I will put a nigga in his own chalk
I let the .9 spill
I got a ill lil' shooter out in Brownsville down for the wild deal
I'll feel blessed if nigga test and my shooter leave him streched 'til the bones in his spine chill
I'm ill nigga, this is not a time drill
I used to serve on the strip and watch Seinfield
Man, I remember serving on the strip
Watching out for cops hopping out suburbans on the strip
Working on the strip, chilling with a .30 on my hip
Whole team of shooters, bunch of Steph Curries in my clique
Boy, I'm a wild boy, check the style, boy
I'm a real baller, you a towel boy
I'll put 'em in the future, no Elroy
'Cause I pop tops like I'm opening some Altoids
Breath minty and fresh Fendi
Got a hustler chick down to smuggle bricks through the West Indies
I'll hustle 'til it's nothing left in me (woah)
And the plug hear 'bout me and gotta invest in me
I send semi's at any nigga that's testin' me
I'm prayin' to the lord, he's the one that been blessing me
But yo, I got a sick set
And my jewels like dipset
And we on cam like dipset
These fuck niggas say they coming for the kid neck?
Give ya dog shots like I'm checking in a sick pet
Got street ties with the street guys
Even if they fly on G5s, they'll kill you for a G5
Fifteen hunnid, my FN gunning
My dawg copped twenty birds, and they just keep coming
He sold four and plus he let a sick team run 'em
We ain't talking 'bout a verse when it's a sixteen coming, check
I'm a real nigga
I keep a Tommy on my body but when you see me, I ain't wearin' Hilfigher
Just a ladder and a roofer that'll drill niggas
And down to take his own charge when he kill niggas
Look, I'm the hot kid in the school
I pull up to the party and I pop chicks in the pool
Hot chicks say I'm hot and my dick is a jewel
Just let me box with that twat, I'll stick it and move
Yo, she like the way my wrist dance
She like the way the wrists on my fist dance
Every time a nigga switch hands
And my guns and shooters on quickstands (he really goin' in!)
You would thinks the guns designer, they way they come in rip pants
Wrist cuts, my wrist slants and I'm in the truck getting jiggy, tryna get up in your chick pants
Bitch dance
It's four hoes with me, if them four hoes did me, shawty, it won't be a fifth chance
My whole stretch from south France to Brisbane
And they attached to the arms like wrist bands
Look, I send 'em up and I'ma send them niggas back if they sent 'em up
My dawg got a twenty on him and a semi tucked
But, I've been in so many life or death situations, I just wanna live it up
I dropped it off and I picked it up
And my jewels all embedded and I'm feeling six'erd up
I'm in the club tryna find a thick chick to fuck
Man, after all my neck and wrist is all glittered up
Bitches wanna fuck it up, now they want to lick it up
They man hear about it next day and wan' get me touched
In a Bentley, tints tucked, Cuban linked up
Big chain on me in case I gotta get you inked up
Wrink up, see the wrist roller wrinked up
Whole squad looking like we robbed us a Brinks truck
Any cat that know Lanez know I'm worldwide
I leave you on your sweatshirt like Earl died
I'm more wavy than a surfer on a curl tide
And you a bitch, even lookin' from your girl's eyes
I'm a stunna, my wrist done up, my girls got the scar tissue on her tits done up
Fucking with her, I'ma have to lift gun up (mm)
And bang bang 'til the tissue on your hip come up
I'm a all around star player
I'm a lot of y'all father like Darth Vader
Fuck niggas know I charge for my hard labour
I spent nights in that cold for that hard paper
Listen, that's why I feel I'm the most hot in the place
A lot of niggas saying they hot but they not in the place
And your block? It ain't hot, man it's safe
Next nigga diss Tory Lanez 'bout to get shot in his face, nigga
I hate niggas that lie and move funny
That why keep fly and chill on the cruise money
Y'all niggas lose money, y'all niggas just snooze money
Just look at my blood, my shit is just ooze money
Look, I do this for that youngin' on the corner
That hustle all day though he never had a daughter
He never had a father, he hustle in the corner
I'm telling that he wilding tryna truck the shit to Florida
But niggas love to hustle, it's aura
When you come up from the poor, you struggle and you sure
You gon' do it for mother, lost your brother to the force
So you in the only son to keep the loving in the core
Every day you ducking strays tryna run in to the store
And you can't afford a bed, layin' covers on the floor
And you momma's stressing and her blood pressure getting lower
And your daughter want that brand new toy
But it's hard to show her that you broke and can't afford it
(You can tell!)
So you on the corner, niggas talking shit and the plug, he keep avoidin' ya
So you wanna hustle and you tryna get your coin up
Out there on your own, but shit, Satan will corner ya
So you wanna own, tryna get your own up
Now I'm on my own, I'm just tryna get my own up
Had to come through, 54, bought the chrome up
Niggas tried to hate, had to bring back the chrome up
I'm on Funk Flex, ayo fuck everybody that said, "fuck Flex"
I don't care what niggas talk and how they wan' talk
I'm on my thing and my niggas let them things bark
Listen, look, I been this way, I don't care how the fuck I'm coming in this way
I'm with my nigga Ray, my nigga Uno and my nigga GP
Niggas come through, I got them bitches on the CD
They gon' watch me like we on the DVD
I don't give a fuck man, you see me on the TV
And I'm all up in the Champs, and I'm all up in Adidas
I got all the bad bitches, more stripes than a zebra
Niggas hatin' on me, 'cause they see me and I'm gettin'
Fuck around, see me magazine, up all up in the features
Double-X-L they ain't want me on the cover, next year they came around
I fucked around and dubbed 'em
I don't give a fuck, y'all nigga know how I be rocking
Forty fifth on the block, niggas milly rocking (sorry, [?])
Ciroc poppin', shout out my nigga French
That French Vanilla is lit and the shit is intense
I had a bad bitches threesomes last night
It was mad riches, all my niggas savages
I come to the block, above the averages
I don't give a fuck, my niggas— ah! Fuck it!
Let's rock, my nigga!

[Outro: Funkmaster Flex & Tory Lanez]
You see us! One take! (Let's rock!)
'Cause you know a lot of you rappers be comin' up here
Don't be doin' one take, I just wanted to bring that up
Don't tighten up 'cause I told the truth
Talkin' about— lemme just say somethin' (what's that?)
I'm doin' this shit for all the people who respect
The classic New York culture
I'm doin' this shit for all... all the young niggas
That—at the— at the end of the day—don't respect this culture
Because I come in and I respect everthing
And I know where the fuck I came from, my nigga
And this is what the fuck I came from
So, I respect all the fuckin' legendary MCs
I do this for niggas like Kiss, Juelz, fuckin' Cass, fuckin' Styles P
Everybody, nigga, y'all know what the fuck I'm talkin' 'bout!
You know what it is, Funk Flex, Tory Lanez
We here, I mean bought— (lemme put my jacket back on)
You know what I'm sayin'? Real cold after that
Remember I said— remember I said one take
And how you niggas be comin' up here don't be one-takin' it
It's okay! Just wanted to acknowledge that though
Top five!
