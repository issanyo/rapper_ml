My first tool 22s
I hung with crews and rocked funny jewels
Gold chains, Halloween
We bombed Sunday schools
First blunts, cuttin' class
First wifey had me nuttin' fast
Used to brag about who I had
Always wore a bag on my dick
Pants sagged on my kicks
Converse weapons, yellow, and purple magics
Bird had that black shit
Shorties jumpin' on mattress
'97, pockets is fat, rock a stocking cap
Under Yankee hats
God, painted me black, thanks for that
I'm original man
Show improve the mack move right in my hand
Blow dro, murderer, M.O., gone for O
Tinted window, hennessy XO, fuckin' wit Esco
Heavy metal can wet you, yo bless you
Jail niggas go ta hell quicker
Lick you wit that hunting shot
Rockin VVS rocks, stylin, wildin
Peace to Queensbridge housin
Congratulate flex, five-hundred thousand sold
Fuckin' better than gold, nigga
