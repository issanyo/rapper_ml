[Verse]
Yeah, ay
Now that I'm awake
I realize there’s more fear inside you than hate
That's okay, I forgive you for your mistakes
Take no days off, and take off, that's the only way
Okay, holy matrimony to this money, man
Sometimes I start to wonder if she love me back
My whole life, I been rolling with the punches
Jabs, hooks, haymakers, me and pain are good friends, my friend
I mean, I don’t even feel the need to pretend, my friend
I'm at Legoland with my kids my friend
They like, "where you been, where you been QM?"
Can you please come back with the hits my friend?
Name rings where I'm from to the six, my friend
Why people know Calabasas exist, my friend
I'm saying, give me mine now
They see it in me, it's just a matter of time now
'Fore they find out, ay
Diamond in the rough like Amy Winehouse
Had to bring the wine out
'Cause shorty coming through, and you know what I'm ’bout, ay
She about it to, I do me in every city
Every street, every room, yeah
Every once in a moon, real ones make it through
I was homeschooled, I don’t get in any these rooms
Talkin' to dudes, no hit records but well respected
Nigga 1-3-1-7
Yeah, flip the script like Spielberg on the set, yep
I a legend like Will Smith, I even got a German Shepard
Run the, done ya, on to the next one
I’m on to some shit, huh
Still gettin' paid to perform on one leg
I be doin' what I said I'm doin’
Rent a car, skating through L.A
Spending money on my way to money, ain't it funny?
Plant seeds and watch trees grow
2018, Kids See Ghost
Humanoid, C-3PO
Ball like CP3 on them folks
Huh, yeah
