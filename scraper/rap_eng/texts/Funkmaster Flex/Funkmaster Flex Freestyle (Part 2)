[Verse 1]
Game on lock, she ain't stepping on this bus if she ain't gon pop
I ain't walking in the jeweler if i ain't gon cop
Stole Mase flow just to say i ain't gon stop,
Who made the beats hot? CL or Pete Rock
Shit or was it a perfect marriage
Me I'm both in one my beats got me the chain
My raps bought me this Range, my diamond chain the clearest
Funny how a youngin, I never liked carrots
But now I'm older and I'm eating better, which means
Less beef and more cheddar, more bread, more lettuce
Was always fucking dimes but nowadays more let us
From a world where love was just four letters, a go getta
My shows better, my flows better
A go getta rarely do i do better
I'm too set in my ways I'm too gutter to change
Should have known that I'm the coldest I'm two letters away
Nigga who better than Jay? From the the the Roc
Not HOV though its Cole yo
Niggas taking pictures every time I'm in the store yo
When I hit the club they be snapping on the low yo
Niggas snapping pictures every fucking where i go yo
Sometimes i be mad as shit
Then I say stupid motherfucker boy you asked for this
Oh yeah I did, didn't I, did it big, didn't I
Made my album sell like it did a bid, didn't I
Check the album credits that's produced and written by
None other then yours truly
I'm bored sue me, I'm all on the Billboards I'm tryna make Forbes sue me
Audio visual nigga, I could score a movie
You couldn't score a bucket, I'm aiming at Warren Buffett
And painting my poorest fuck it, it rains and it pours
I'm covered out on these tours, running a train on your whore
Take her home in a Ford, ironic 'cause I explore
Nigga I explore!

[Verse 2]
Prophecys fulfilled, as i proceed to kneel
Dodging greed of niggas who cock and squeeze to steal
I do this for my niggas that got degrees and still broke as fuck
Fuck your flag, democracy has failed
I'm in the realest state with no properties for sale
Probably could build with Socrates himself
No soccer moms to throw us on soccer teams but still
Kick shit so cold boy, I can freeze in hell
Now do tell exactly how does it feel
Tryna save a generation knowing that you never will
Tryna do rap without some nigga tryna pay your bills
Cause you black and rap you'll never do no numbers like Adele
Oh well Momma already been through hell
I could turn this into heaven if my records even sell
I'm a firm believer if you never quit you never fail
If I slip I grab the rail, I'll get a grip and never fail

[Verse 3]
Falling victim to this society, wheres hoes gaining notoriety
And if I ain't rocking chains these kids won't admire me
Niggas try extorting me to get a verse up out of me
Nigga eat dick your street shit don't apply to me
I walk around dolo no security YOLO
So if a nigga plan to put a bullet through my polo
Cause i wouldn't help his promo so be it
Kill you niggas without licking a shot, this cold war, Soviet
No Vietnam, back in Fayettenam. no stay at home moms
We was far from street niggas but we played along
Walk around with our mean mugs painted on
Rest in peace to all the teen thugs
May the lord bless your soul
Cross the crossings this must be called life
Momma stressed she been stressing all night
But momma your little bundle of joy
Is clever enough to avoid the pitfalls of this world they destroyed
This is clever nigga i never seen another nigga
