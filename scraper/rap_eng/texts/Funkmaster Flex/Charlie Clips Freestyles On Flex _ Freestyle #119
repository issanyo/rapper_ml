Look I got a question for you Flex who is hot as me
What's his name no you joking you gotta be
For real tho answer that honestly
By [the] time you answer that I’ll be skinny or you gon hit the lottery
Look all these niggas is rapping with [?] told before
How they chop bricks the move white what they sow before
I'm thinking about they girl if I'm gon raw
Cuz I know no condom Achilles niggas this is a Trojan War
Achilles, they got one horse
Two-car garage a Maserati, one Porsche
Ride down the block bitch screaming out: "How much one cost?"
The man on my navigation sound like Young Dolph
My swag on the million your mother was an Indian your dad was a pilgrim
The old Eagle back McNabb in the building
Beam on it, I’m playing laser tag with the children
Nah, better stuff to do with a gun
I'm a psycho I can load and put two in your son
But why I do that when I could call you boo and ya hun
Cuz killing kids and something that she do with her tongue
Nasty, with my nine don't ask me I get crazy with it
One eye, halfway open Tracy McGrady with it
Kill shot with a machine gun Slim Shady with it
Hole so big the corner'll think the Navy did it
Gun so big I can't tuck it, I got a babysit it
Shit go boom sound like is an 80 in it
Pressure bust pipes and this pipe I get crazy with it
Pause I grab a biscuit and make gravy with it
Who hungry you wanna get a meal
Ay Flex I got a different feel
I popped pill niggas asleep well that been the drill
Pill put niggas to sleep, ain't that Benadryl?
I'm so motherfucking mean with it
I could bring that shit back and do a whole another scheme with it
I peel your whole block like take two of these
Yeah I came in the pack but I bet your crew will leave
You know Aleve is in the pack that was mad real
Now watch how these pros act [Prozac] cuz I got mad skills
A thousand dollars for the pasta was my last bill
And another five hundred just to add veal [Advil]
Flex I'm a veteran before gambling I ain’t never medicine
So tell niggas let us in ’fore they chest get a Lil' Weezy
Your name movin on up like George Jefferson
These niggas waking up gay in the morning
I’m waking up with a Kim like Ye in the morning
Extra condom in case she say stay in the morning
Just know I always keep a hat on like sway in the morning
I'm back and these other niggas is not me
Put them all together tell them stop me
They want to go back and forth like it was tennis okay I copy
I'm a serve 'em to the racket tearing [racketeering] like Tekashi
New York fell off? they’ve gotten
How the dirty apple could be so rotten
The beam on top of my gun you see me squatting
Like the chick at the end of her period I'm just spotting
That's what happens when that hammer drawn
Oh niggas front when the camera on
This chick said you on Wild N' Out you ain't got no hammer on
I said bitch I met Nick with the cannon on
Oh don't make me go and dunk mine
And brain sticks to the field like he did up in drumline
And that there ain't no punch line
Since a kid I was taught to milk the trade thanks to the lunch line
My boss got me on Flex nigga it wasn't free
And battle rappers made it up here because of me
So next time you say "Thank You, God. I made it on Flex"
Make sure you have my thank-you card
