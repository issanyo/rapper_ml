DJ Holiday bruh, I see you
I mean, that mixtape thing for me
In the beginning, that wasn’t
I wasn’t like a street DJ
My tapes from the tunnel was getting bootlegged
And I want to make my own album
I wanted - the funny thing is I really did want 60 minutes
Of how I felt I sounded
Matter of fact I went to Japan once
And they were selling a tape of me from a night club
And I remember that night I was sick
So I felt like that wasn’t the best representation
Of what I wanted to be
So I was like I’m a make my own tape
Except I’m a shop it to a label
And I’m a put it out
So on that note, cause you know I wanna
Give respect to people like
Prucey B, K Capri, Love Boy Starsky, DJ Clue, DJ Doo Wop, DJ SS
Cause they was doing it from that ground level
From the street up
So I was getting some pretty big budgets from them album
So I must definitely say God Bless The Mixtape
Absolutely! Funk Flex and I’m out
Or I should say Funk Flex and I’m on to the next
