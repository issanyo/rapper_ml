[Intro]
You think Philly cats won't snap on your motherfucking ass
Huh, you think we won't pull these hammers out and do what we do, nigga
We live this, nigga. We don't just talk it, we live it
Motherfucker take it to the streets, that's all I can say
Take it to the motherfucking streets, give me more nigga

[Hook x2]
You a dead man walking
Have you like, "Damn, why am I in this coffin?"
Nigga, I live the life that you talking
I hold the heat, shoot a motherfucking target
You better duck bitch

[Spade]
He the dead man, he the fucked talking in Fed land
He want me murdered, so shit when I heard it
I thought the nigga had life sentences concurrent
Man, I can't sleep 'till I see this nigga buried
Same nigga pointed out my man to the jury
Oh, him ha, oh, he be working in the gym ha
But you know its Spade that guns that make him slim, ha
And a type [?] that'll make a nigga sin, ha
D.A. reduced his ass to 5 to 10, ha
He telling on how he was a three time felon
But, nah, me not worry give him 2 to his melon
He's a dead man walking, dead man talking
Dead man eating, dead man sleeping
Go for his tool he's a dead man reaching
Open up his mouth he be a dead man speaking
Find em duck taped in the red van leaking
And shit, when I see him, it ain't no rap
Don't have nothing on your hip, if it ain't no gat
I'll put that thing to the beak, on his baseball cap
Throw the muffler on the front so there ain't no clap

[Hook x2]
You a dead man walking
Have you like, "Damn, why am I in this coffin?"

[Beanie Sigel]
I stay strapped, I keep a half a hundred to cap
I put your stomach in your lap
You don't want none of the Mack
The gun'll come out if I think your runnin your mouth
I fuck around and have fifity niggas run in your house
Plus I keep an escape route to avoid the State Troop
Talkin to the jakes goose? 4 in your grapefruit
Catch me population, yard out, gray suit
You'se a bitch nigga, P.C. is where they take you
You think that clique tight, somebody bluffin
9 guns in a shootout, but 8 bustin
Let me find a female dog in my clique
I'mma grab the revolver in give em off 6
The same niggas that you thought would never snitch
Is fuckin your bitch, got the keys to your wip
Stay in your crib, eatin all your shit
Probably owe you shit, watch who you rollin with

[Hook x2]

[Dutch]
It take a baller ta ball Playa to pimp
You can tella gangsta when he walk he limp
And every time he talk he talk real quick
Get caught by the cops, don't know shit
Even if its him, don't know shit
He's the type of dude you just don't fuck with
Talk real breezy, or press your luck with
And if you wanna know who he is, he Dutch, bitch
His watch is his power, chain is his strength
Money getting low, police watchin my strips
Helicopters, binoculars watchin my bricks
Getting in my grime, changin my flip
I'm too young to be stressed
Daughter need pampers, daddy need rest
Baby moms trippn, tryn cause my arrest
You think its suicide, walkin without a vest
You a dead man, nigga

[Hook x2]
You a dead man walking
Have you like, "Damn, why am I in this coffin?"
Nigga, I live the life that you talking
I hold the heat, shoot a motherfucking target
You better duck bitch
