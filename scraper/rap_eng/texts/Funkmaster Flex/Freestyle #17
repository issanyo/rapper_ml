You are now tuned in to the Golden state
To all my niguhs on the streets and behind closed gates
Continue to maintain daily and carry the weight
And all my folks on the outside continue to rise
Finally released to the rest of the nation, anticipation
Was killin' me, my niguh Flex said niguhs is feelin' me
Larger than life baby with crazy respect
You know these Alkaholik niguhs guaranteed to get you wet
Don't sweat the technique cause I was put on the street
To delete the weak minded, if you've got beef then grind it
Most niggas is blinded by the glamour and glitz
But I don't fuck with that shit
Your only dope was your last hit
Constantly lit up from the place where we hit 'em
In the wrong hair dresser have you leavin' in an ambulance stretcher
Xzibit heard a thousand strikes
I give a fuck about five mics, and kerosine lights
All I need is my royalty checks my ice cold Becks
So bitch you dig ruff sex with Funkmaster Flex
Bringin' it live from my tape deck from N.Y.C
To the We.S.T. switch the X to the Z
You are now tuned in to the Golden state
To all my niggas on the streets and behind closed gates
Continue to maintain daily and carry the wieght
And all my folks on the outside continue to rise
