Ayo, this is PPP right here
And we don't give a fuck what y'all doin' in this rap game
Matter of fact, (sniff) I smell... PUSSY!!!
Yo Sauk, let it bang...

(Saukrates)
As mighty a man you've ever seen spitting amphetamine
To all those congested, my job raw never clean
A toast to the uncontested, murderer
I mark your mistake as soon as you're rested, I heard of ya
Unattended for your double breasted, bulletproof vest kid
Time is money well invested, burning your press kit
Ya HEARD me, chic-ow, bless it and pass it leftwards
Never protested, the living proof manifested
Winkled your face, you better press it, menage-a-trois
Put fist in thought, care to test it?  If you dare I swear
Motionless, I throw a stare in the eyes of uncommon wise soldier
Rise like Nike, shares growing older, snowball effect to snow boulder
Show you love nigga, I'm iceberg with cold shoulder
No time for your manic, hazy rap attack partner
Future darker than black permanent black... marker
I part you from existence on solid ground
Only twelve inch but long distance, that's all I frown
Is we hell or is we heaven bound?
I bomb the target without a sound
Ain't nobody left around to hear it
Sipping fine wine and spirits on summer days
By the South Pacific, cheddar sound better when specific
Cheddar look better when explicit
Cheddar get better when statistics rise like mama biscuits
All 'n all, I'm having fun with gun
Cause world gave me gun, detonate the shells with my tongue
I'm young plus I'm well hung
Threat to intellect, also got your prize possession sprung
I ride the fine line between yours and mine, check the design
Bre-X cats wondering how rhyme turn sublime
Peep my shines coming from behind
I'm high beaming in your rear view
Get out the left lane before I steer through
Ain't even trying to hear you
It was important 'til you thought I feared you
Naw, loosen your bra bitch
Never rest until I'm considered, the high exalted
Even then I'll still be bitter, sipping on malted
Through the speech, now it's time to walk it
This potent poet, who only spit it if he know it
Prefer to show it to the hardest of hip hop artist
If you a baby making baby, finish what you started and be a MAN
God damn, resort to plan B sucking on candy
For delicate procedure, no time for leisure
The fine line between yours and mine, freak the design
Bre-X cats wondering how rhyme turn sublime
Peep my shines coming from behind
I'm high beaming in your rear view, CRASH
I stop at nothing
My blood stream pumping nothing but utter destruction
Towards cats I describe in this rap production
Suffering from mal concussions, you head bangers catching repercussion
First impression had you lustin'
Now the name Saukrates ringing more than bells
Double X-L quote me well, bringing the future
Double X-L quote me well, bringing the future
You want to poise for the portrait, here let me shoot you
