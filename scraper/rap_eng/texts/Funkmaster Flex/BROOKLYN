Verse 1: Lady Sha Bk
When a nigga meet me
First thing that he ask?
Where you from Ma
Brooklyn
Can't you tell by the way that I talk
Swag is ridiculous
Cocky in my own right
Brooklyn got it's own rights
So let me show you where the Fuck I'm from
Bang' Bang

Brawls Outs
No Cop Outs
That's why my goons got these niggas laid out
And these bitches

Burner in the Birkin bag
And still bad
Rock -A tims bitch like Foxy can't knock me
Always got a scheme

Verse 2: Lady Sha Bk
A Brooklyn girl like me
You meet me in the club
Bad so he thinking that he really gonna fuck
But I lucked up
Got him trippin
While he putting the keys in the door
While I'm calling my mans up
Hit him for jewls
Hit him, Hit him for the cash
We want it all
Nigga, Nigga, Nigga run it all
From your daugher's bracelet
Your Mommy's necklace
I'm moving reckless
This is a Brooklyn Stickup
What up Danse
I'm dime but I get away with murder
Now who want it, ya'll
Ya'll fronting
Poker face but your cards say nothing
I'm from the borough where the truth be told
Gun buck if you acting fake
Then its black hoodies and yellow tape
If you fucking with me man
