[Verse]
We still hustle til' the cows come home
Momma praying that her child come home
It's a hot summer, get caught you do not utter
Police come we run, we out, we dippin' like hot butter
I swear you gotta be built for this shit
And ought to be ready and willing to deal with this shit
I got three hustles thats three incomes nigga
I just can't sit on my ass thats why I been up nigga
Chin up head high don't slip up nigga
Sit up nigga, them boys plotting grip up nigga
Act tough where you stand is where you'll end up nigga
Where I'm from thats what it is ain't no if buts nigga
Don't trip up nigga, you fall you better get up nigga
My brother picked up a gun I picked a pen up nigga
But when he died I picked that clip up nigga
Watch over me bro and make sure I never give up nigga
I got my city on my back and my shoulders
I got niggas that pop off like the back on controllers
They can't control it
We here forever they here for the moments
I'm so NY thats why my logo a token
My main focus is to stay focused
Remain focused never change focused
Came in the game focused
Told these lames hold this, now they face frozen
Cause they see me doing shit they never thought a bitch could do, and now they wanna ride the wave heres a paddle canoe
Got more bitches dropping panties then club pollute
Its red life paint the city red
Get rich or die trying thats what 50 said
Im out here working trying to get the Diddy bread
Reppin brooklyn du cap with the biggie head
Hip hop was just sleeping wasn't really dead
And since life is a bitch I made it give me head
