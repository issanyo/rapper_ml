[Verse 1: Lil Yachty/Boat]
Nigga, free Reese, free Nino
The world is mine like I'm Al Pacino
Got more money than a lil' casino
Got caught fuckin' on a bitch and her boyfriend walked in wearin' full Chinos
Hopped out the back door, ran a four flat
That was like way back
Nowadays I just sit and laugh
Chopstick long as one giraffe
And I'm comin' through, clear the whole path
Walked in the damn spot, it was all... team of niggas, fuck the whole staff

[Verse 2: Lil Yachty/Boat]
Goddamn, nigga, too playa
Why you hate? 'Cause I'm too rare
Young nigga, I'm a fresh prince, coulda bought a crib out in Bel Air
Fuckin' on a bitch from Delaware
$30,000 on a new coat, call PETA up, gon' and soak it in
Tag still hangin' from it, had it for a year and I ain't even broke it in
Diamond choker so tight, tried to lift it up, shit did not go over chin
In the studio with Migo gang, everything we make is propane
Call ten bitches from the Blue Flame
Fuck 'em all, we ain't even know their name
Front row at the ball game
Who that is dunkin'? Shit, that's what's his name
I don't even fuckin' watch sports but my backyard like a golf course
Niggas hatin', on my dick and shit, I got more guns than a task force
When I talk, my voice kinda high
Niggas hatin' usually sound kinda hoarse
My ex-bitch is built like a horse, she was 27, I was 19

[Verse 3: Lil Yachty/Boat]
Shawty there was a real stallion
But I ain't trust her, feel like shawty there was wildin'
Young nigga, bitch, I'm QC, you can see this shit through the gold medallion
After this I'm out to Staten Island, got a young bitch, she be really stallin'
My young nigga tote a dirty K, I call him Dirty Dan, he'll flip your van
Kick your door hard as Jackie Chan
Take your chain right up off your nightstand, lil' nigga

[Outro: Lil Yachty]
Staten Island..Lil Boat..
