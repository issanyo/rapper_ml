[Ray Charles]
Uh, Quincy, now, the next tune is a loud thing
It’s nothing like the blues
And … Let the Good Times Roll
I know I sound bad but you can overlook that
I’ve been up all night, 8 o’clock in the morning…
If you can do something with that, you’re better than me
Alright

[Funkmaster Flex]
You got brown butter with a beat
Funkmaster Flex, do what you gotta do
Q’s Jook Joint is in full effect
Bringing the old to the new, the new to the old
You know what I’m saying?
Fever in the funk house
Grind ‘til you lose your mind
Nothin’ but flavor
Let the good times roll, a’ight?
