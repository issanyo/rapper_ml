[Intro: Chika]
Mm
Hello stranger

[Verse: Chika]
Yeah
Can't shake the feelin' I got eyes on me
I gotta say, I'm not surprised, homie
I worked my ass off
People nowadays put out the verses they can pass off
Similar to hittin' Donald Trump because his ass soft
Pardon the visual
Perfect in the physical
This moment is pivotal
Pause it
I done came a long from rappin' in my closet
Went from bein' broke to steady stackin' up deposits
Take a picture
It'll last long
Prob'ly wanna fast song
Like the government
Just want everything they can tax on
Gotta lot o' issues
I just don't know what to act on
Beauty and the Beast and all my haters
Look like gassed on
Gassed up
Done with bein' passed up
Future lookin' clearer than
CÃŽROC up in a glass cup
Bullets overrated
Come with verses if you act up
I'm not on my horse
But my carriage jacked up
And my flow impeccable
On point like a decimal
Standin' over n****s
I suggest you eat your vegetables
I make killin' ethical
Comin' for the slaughter
'Cause I am my daddy's daughter
But I flow so hard
They lookin' for my testicles
I'm reckless
It's everyday, just like a breakfast
I ain't have time to plan it
I'm ahead of all my checklists
Imagine all my exes
I got one in Texas
She could text me now
I act like I ain't get the message
Sorry I can't text, miss
I'm busy on Flex, miss
Got a flow that make you atheists
Believe in X-mas
People wanna snack
But what is caviar to Chex Mix
At these n****s necks
I rap around 'em like a necklace
I had to do it 'cause my mama watchin'
I've done a lot o' talkin'
Now she see I'm on and poppin'
Put Alabama on the map
My block is milly rockin'
My state is golden
I'm a warrior like Billy Thompson
Yeah

[Outro: Funkmaster Flex]
They see us. You know what it is. Bars. I mean, we just here, baby. You know what it is
