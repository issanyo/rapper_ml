Death before dishonour apologies your honor
But they label me a suspect 'cause Iâ€™m black and that's a problem
They sentenced Cornell to a hundred years without an option
That hurt and that shit fucking with my conscious
Man this system out of pocket
Try my best to slow down on that henny
But my anger and the pain don't ever let me
I'm losing love for many
Too much bottled up but when the time is right I'm ready
You gon' miss me when I'm gone just dont forget me
In the lab I'm cooking up they calling me the chemist
Free my nigga Taxstone he one of the realist
People talking to the world he is labeled a killer
But I know him and I know we see the bigger picture, I don't get it
Left my hood alone cuz it was nothing there for me
Every everday I gotta hear stories, That shit's so wack
Plenty nights I wanna get my gat
One life and you can't get that back so I stay humble
I'm addicted to hustle I let it work so I'm addicted to struggle
For what is worth I say fuck what they say
I came here to take my spot I'm pointing cuts and they pay
Strippers love me throwing ones in their face, Be safe tho'
Niggas talking like they made me
I must shine regardless they get back and shade me
I did a lot but never hated on my devy shit
Showing no weakness I been playing defense
Shout out to the [? 1:57] tho he gotta upon the [? 1:58]
Appreciate the love bro' cause in this game you need it
Loyalty is everything but they don't know the meaning
Karma came around and that's my bitch I know you seen her
I used to have a product on my block I was target for the cops
I was young and I was hot but now I'm different
Wait I forgot to mention that I used to keep a smithing for the drama
Cause the options is tryna ride up I ain't slipping
I miss my nigga Shyste I lost my brother life to cripping
Lately I been on it fuck these bitches ain't nobody see my vision
When I had no pot to piss in we was broke
Got the chance went to Rosenberg is crazy how I choke but I embrace it
Cause time is running out and they been wainting
Mommy be so patience. Me? I'm running out of patience
I'm just getting older all this weight that's on my shoulders
Mah don't worry I'm a soldier and I promise I'ma make it

Reminiscing rolling weed up and kicking my feet up
Before these Louis V's I was rocking Adidas
I was trapping harder and fucking Abriah
Now I feel like Ace when he walked out to clean us
I finger fucked Anina like she was a diva
Kept it on me couldn't tello cause it might to mean her
I was in the field when you was watching Cousin Skeeter
They said life is a bitch but you gotta know how to treat her
Hold up this shit get deeper I love Shyste to the streets
Ever since I been riding so I know we rest in peace
Cornell went up got enticed said I'm camo every week
He set in and tried to fight it I just hope they setting him free
And I hope when niggas see they keep that same energy
Cause I'm tired tryna hide me pain by drinking hennessy
Grab my spliff and hit the booth and spit whatever come to me
Best believe I ain't go hesitate if niggas come for me
On the come up I'm from when niggas run up
And make the winter fell just like summer
Stay woke dont slumber I miss Shyste we was just like brothers
And he really was the reason why I picked that gun up
We was young, we was dumb but we had great mothers
We was wilding and we ain't thank goverment acting like life ain't nothing
On the block in the late night puffer
Cops catches us and they like cuff up
We just wanted to hustle
We ain't have no choice and we black
So we ain't have no voice, had to stand on point
Music took me out the streets I seen that shit with passion
From the bottom they never thought I would make it happen
Was on the corner til the morning just to get some Jordans
Been recording and performing now my name important
Gotta a daughter she so gourgeous swear I do it for her
Then come more work and I been grinding I been praying for her
Men lie, women lie, but the numbers don't
When a lot Nula but in the never know
I gotta story to tell 'bout how I grew up in hell
When I was just a little boy they threw my daddy in jail
Three years later got deported soon as he left the cell
Damn, never made to home so me and mommy stayed alone
Waiting by the phone she had to raise me on her own
Lil' vagabond I couldn't stay above that road
Why? cause I kept seeing seanotes
I see these nigaas plotting so I keep the ear closed
(Krrrt) the only thing that we know
The weed we smoke dont come from the East Coast
I gotta a bad bitch to bad that that's a plastic
It do not matter you know that I'm a savage
I'm 'bout to do a fucking backflip
I put that working and that shit got me active
Milion dolars [? 4:57] while they sleep and stay woke
I dont party on the weekends go hard or go home nigga
I was once a known dealer had to elevate
Before them people build a case and try to throw me in a cage
Flex I can do this all night
Got that bag and they mad shit I ve been doing alright
Pull out in that black on black I might do it all white
I'm the man and now you..and I know you got the kite
