Verse 1: Jay Dee

And this goes out to everybody who doubts, runnin' ya mouth
And don't know what you talkin' 'bout
You ain't familiar wit' the D, don't go that route
Just keep ya hand on ya toolie if ya walkin' 'bout
It's all live now
And for the greatest amount
But make the ladies say Oh
And the hoes say oww
And the owls say whoot da whoot
Turnin' it out
It's SV still on a quest baby knockin' you out
It's like dat

Word up
It's The Love Movement, it's all love
Cause we make ma-fuckas be fond of us,(us us)
We like the ladies, intelligent ones
But when the lights go out it's time to fondle us, (us us)
It's apprehension, when playin' ya joint
Cause Jay Dee makes it sound so marvelous, (us us)
If you beefin', then settle ya soul
While we make all of y'all just bond wit' us
Got your work on you, you better put it away
Police be lookin' for the vandlous, (us us)
Jay Dee from the D, SV family
Phife these jokers can't handle us (us us)
