[Intro]
Just call my name
Just call my name
Just call my name
Just call my name

[Verse 1]
Pimp shit, uh
Uh, pimp shit
Yeah, turn my shit up a little bit
My vocals, uh, uh
I, hypnotize ya eyes and then you recognize
That the sparkles of my chrome shoes paralyze
Gettin money like this, people want my vibe
Full of jealousy and pride, hate the way I ride
Sometimes ya speak, sometimes ya don't
Figure this nigga souped up, 'cause he couped up
Guaranteed to rip shit, soon as its looped up
Y'all niggas slept, 20 girls panties wasn't wet
I'm a star, double the dick, the double R
Never struggle hard to leave the bubble scarred
Not the car, it's the man, daddy cool put it down
No comparin' me to y'all, niggas is circus clowns
L.A. worth paper
Ask Russell Simmons, who put him up in that skyscraper?
Ask my dogs up at FUBU, who made them major?
LL nigga, now who's next that need a favor?
Drop a bomb on 'em
Remain calm on her
Pierce her nipples, throw the LL charm on her
Keep gangsta shit pumpin' through my system
When my strobe lights flash you can't miss 'em
Listen

[Chorus]
Just call my name, ooh
Just call my name, uhh
Just call my name, aw yeah
Just call my name

[Verse 2]
59th street bridge up a roadway, do about a buck
Pumpin' Mobb in the Cadillac truck, don't give a fuck
Gold tint, gold diggin' broads gettin' bent
We can fuck, but you ain't gettin' 10 cent, who want it?
Lay the facts out until the cats out
Set 'cha back out, sweat 'cha tracks out, blow out your weed
You wake up in the morning to a note, "Nigga had to leave."
Be easy, you shoulda teased me, instead of bein' sleazy
I wouldn't do you greasy, come across more floss than gold teeth
I learned you can't eat, if ya hold beef, with niggas underneath
Still I'ma lyrically hold it down
L back in town, 'case the bell sound for the second round
Some of these old cats is funny, fuck who's legendary
I'm tryin' to get this money
Drop a bomb on 'em, and pour a Dom on 'em
As soon as the track come on, I transform on 'em
Keep gangsta shit pumpin' through my system
Strobe lights flashin' can't miss 'em
Listen

[Chorus]
Just call my name, ooh
Just call my name, uhh
Just call my name, aw yeah
Just call my name (break it down)
L-L-LL-LL Cool J

[Verse 3]
Rappers don't really want it, they might claim they do
They know I'm catchin' bodies, go 'head name a few
After I blaze you, I get a doughnut
Don't want no blood up on my chrome shoes
Lord have mercy, these rookies got it confused
You thought you caught me slippin', I was falsely accused
Of sleepin' with my Eyes Wide Shut, like Tom Cruise
They wishin' an impossible mission to see me lose
Playa, time to choose, all I hate is on the left
You hopin' and prayin' you get to hear me take my last breath
Lyrically, but I gang bang the track, chop sling like crack
Hundred keys a month, you fuckin' up G packs, nigga
Invincible, unstoppable
Y'all niggas ain't ill, you're illogical
This is L, the pigeon thriller, dream fulfiller
A little somethin' for ya ice grillers
Drop a bomb on 'em
When its time to attack Quiet Storm on 'em
Hold ya nuts and keep ya palms on 'em
Keep gangsta shit pumpin' through my system
When my strobe lights flash you can't miss 'em
Listen

[Chorus]
Just call my name, ooh
Just call my name, uhh
Just call my name, aw yeah
Just call my name
