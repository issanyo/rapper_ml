[Intro: Big Kap]
Funk Flex, Big Kap
Mary J, Def Jam, let's go

[Chorus: Mary J. Blige]
Confrontation, confrontation
Confrontation, confrontation
Confrontation, confrontation
Confrontation, confrontation

[Verse 1: Mary J. Blige]
Are you mad because I turned it around?
But if I stayed the same
You would still be running your mouth, oh
You never doubt the Queen of Hip-Hop soul (Ah yeah)
I never let you down 'cause I'm on a roll (Never)
My new CD is in your store
So pick it up and feel my soul

[Chorus: Mary J. Blige]
Confrontation, confrontation
Confrontation, confrontation
Confrontation, confrontation
Confrontation, confrontation

[Verse 2: Mary J. Blige]
Everybody wants to know where I've been
'Cause living life the way I do seems to be a sin, oh
But that stuff follows me everywhere I go (Always)
Get off my bed this shit is out of control
Don't come too close because you never know
What I would do if you disrespect me, oohh oohh

[Chorus: Mary J. Blige]
Confrontation, confrontation
Confrontation, confrontation
Confrontation, confrontation
Confrontation, confrontation
