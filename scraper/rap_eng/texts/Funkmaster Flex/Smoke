Smells like smoke
Smells like smoke
It smelled like smoke
Or smells like the stench of a Saturday night
The ceiling broke
The neighboors woke to the rain
When I woke to the orange light
One minute I'm burning up
Then I'm soaked in the fire fight
The fire drowned and the water choked tonight
It's when you're kicking up the dirt
You kick your spurs to the sun
It isn't what you do, it's what you've done

Someone said you died last night
But that you were fine
When you came to the church on Sunday
You were looking like Saturday night

Someone said you died last night
But that you were fine
When you came to the church on Sunday
You were looking like Saturday night

The buggies climb in when the kids climb out
Well there are polka dots of buggies
Where the screens ripped out
The yellow toys swim through a dusty filth
They've got to break down the homes
That the buggies have built

It's when they're kicking up the dirt
They kick their spurs to the sun
When the buggies they sting
Kiddies, they run

Someone said you died last night
But that you were fine
When you came to the church on Sunday
You were looking like Saturday night

Someone said you died last night
But that you were fine
When you came to the church on Sunday
You were looking like Saturday night

Smells like smoke
Smells like smoke
Smells like smoke
