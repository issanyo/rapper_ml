Something wrong with you, genetics
Your haircut is anti-semitic
Bet it
Your raps are spicy like lettuce
Get it
(lettuce isn’t spicy)

Stay problematic, at least you’re consistent
Just like your fanbase, straight white and autistic
Listen
I understand
Your vice interview was a transitional time for your brand
You use humor as a deflection
It’s acting
But just facts, your name is radioactive
Fetty did your hook, now he gets no play
Rich homie said yes, now he works part time at chipotle
AY!
(where’s fetty?)

You wanna put that on vinyl?
You make more black men disappear than the Cavs in the finals
(KEVIN LOVE)

I know
You repping the Sixers, listen
Me too, i trust the process
Asked to sit court side woulda said yes
But i didn’t see your ass when we went 10-72
Peaked in the first game, how’s that for news
Michael carter williams it reminded of you

I can’t lose
I can’t lose

How’s this for a headline
I’m lucky

Lil dicky the first man to get syphilis without fucking
(i ain’t done!)

You’re repulsive to women
Can’t get em back to the bus
Still swiping on tinder
Checkmark ain’t enough
(no love, no love, no love)

And kevin hart is just acting
He thinks you’re there to finish his taxes

So you got a pilot
That ain’t impressive to me
FX needs another white dude with a questionable sexual history
Miss me, make your eyes get misty
Raps so cold i’m fuckin chilly
You’re getting bodied by a white dude that’s actually from philly

Straight up though, put me on that series, bro, i’m tryina break in

You need a staff writer? i got samples
Wrote a good spec for atlanta
Did shit at UCB too
Failed out of sketch 101
So i could work for you

I’m qualified, i’m hot, don’t lie
Use your privilege by helping a slightly poorer white guy

Lil dicky
Fuck you
Please notice me
I love you
