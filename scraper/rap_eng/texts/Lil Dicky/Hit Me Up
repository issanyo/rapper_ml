[Verse 1]
D up on the track
They shook
Race good
Cheetah on a track

Great hooks
Facebook
We up on the map
Now the cake good from rappin'
Cray up on a mac

We been getting pussy like all damn night bruh
Philly D Lil Dicky be up on that L Dykstra

Think I need a diaper...shittin' when I cypher
Stay wit Eminem like ya man's Mekhi Phifer

Whoa
Dicky ballin' foreal
All these models all up on him got 'em callin' him seal
Every song is getting bomber like a mall in Israel
And I been buzzin' like I'm chugging alcohol wit no meal

I got that shit, everybody know that Dicky been kickin'
Da sickest shit and killin' criminal's spittin' so

If you get wanna get at me then
You know where I be at
If you didn't know about the kid then lemme recap

Baby I been all around the fuckin' world
Huggin' da girls
These muthafuckin' bitches lovin' the curls

The kid been takin' his vacation days and
Makin' bacon, basically takin' the game and changing
It to make it relatable

Trader Joe's up in the fridge boi
Unprotected sex without no kids boi
Makin' sure ma lady take dat pill boi

Gotta keep it real
Honesty about to get ya boi a deal, boi
Comedy in songs, fuck da kill joys

But like

[Hook]
Man, I wish I could sing good
If I was a chick, right now this a single
But until this shit get around, then it's all ya dude
Up in his room, getting down, but it's all for you
So like
Shoot
If you know somebody that produce
Or a hottie that'll sing about her boobs
Hit me up on gmail yo
Cause I been tryna take dis shit to retail bro
And I don't know have any contacts


[Verse 2]
Alright I'm back up in this bitch
Spittin' crack, up on the track
Up on the mac, up in this bitch

I been anxious to see whats actually happenin' with this
Cause the rappin' that's crackin' em up is actually legit
You know

I'm bout to get it, better bring in the medic, I'm reppin'
Literally, every regular person, get up on ma credit level
Better than your better will ever be, spittin' incredibly
Ready, I'ma get on that melody wit dat real shit

I'm the only rapper not exactly sure what trill is
But I'm still attacking every track and I been killin'

Shit, but dude I'm scared of the hood
It's really spooky, dat ain't racist, think you misunderstood

Lil Dicky bullshitting, and good livin' wit good writtens
So good riddance, to every rapper acting so cool wit it
I school bitches, but still I'm acting a fool wit it
So fuck all the tools wit they stupid ass music but...

[Hook]
Man, I wish I could sing good
If I was a chick, right now this a single
But until this shit get around, then it's all ya dude
Up in his room, getting down, but it's all for you
So like
Shoot
If you know somebody that produce
Or a hottie that'll sing about her boobs
Hit me up on gmail yo
Cause I been tryna take dis shit to retail bro
And I don't know have any contacts

[Outro]
Man
If y'all could see the rinky-dink operation I'm runnin' over here
First off, all this shit is in Garage Band
Get that fucking Garage Band
Like I don't know how to work the right software
Uh, every other rapper has like a fucking clique like Odd Future or Cash Money where they're like, "Oh, I'll get Wayne on the verse or Drake on the verse"
I gotta do every fucking verse myself man
I mean, imagine if I knew like a soulful black dude
Like the guy from "Thrift Shop"
Like if I knew him and could get him on a hook, it'd be a rap!
But, man
I'm saying though, if you know somebody that produces or sings well, email me!
I got a business background, so, we could, we could do business
Have a good day
