I’m too nice
Like a lil youngin that fell in love with a boo twice
As in double as fuckable as he was
And dude tries to be subtle and get her cuddling
Venting her troubles and getting her truffles
And ending up befuddled when she don’t fuck him
And someone tell him, “Listen, you buggin’
She never fucking a pedestrian muggle like you
So why all the trouble?”, but he rebuttal with
“I think I just love her so I would shudder at the thought of being anything other than nice”
Heat bang like I caught a body
It wasn’t even deep dang, shit it’s all a hobby
It’s too bad bitches sleeping on me, threesome
Cause everybody want to help but he don’t need none
I’m all time like the wall at the bank
You no shot like you drawing a blank
Honestly you probably couldn’t hang man
I been drawing it blank
Giving you lines while you sitting there and drawing a blank
So go on and rank
Chillin' like it's dough in the bank
Flowing danker than a grower in Napa
Growing the stankest cannabis
Go on, rapping poet,  smacking the hoe-st rappers
Who showing the total package
Like my flaccid is growing fat as samoan cracker
Rapper, I’m about to keep going
Yeah the rapping’s a wrap
I know you rappers napping don’t know it
This a dagger, the pitter patter tapping on the window
Is a real accurate metaphor of what you have in the store
And I be snapping
The splashing on the pane be your rain
Falling quicker than Aladdin for his dame
Oh you better than me?
I’m not one for fuck shit
