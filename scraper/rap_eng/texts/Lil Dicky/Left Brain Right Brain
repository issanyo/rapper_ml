[Intro]
Brain (mmmm)
You ain't even know if I'd even come back
What's wrong with them?
I guess everybody's ignorant, even Brain
Feel like I'm in the Dominican (transactions)
Slow down papi (papito, papito, papito)
Count it up
It's all there (it's all there)
It's all there (it's all there)
Brain always got it (ya, ya)
Brain always got it (ya, ya, yeah!)

[Verse 1]
Brain the one makin' them schemes
Brain the one makin' that cream
Brain always stuck in routine
Brain fuck yo bitch in the club
Brain wanna cop me some red bottoms
Brain wonder what is a lean? (what is it?)
Hear that shit all the time
Brain don't know what it mean (yea, yea)
Who the fuck let the dogs out?
Brain 'bout to swing on the Havanese
Tryna get this bitch's pants off
Her fly in my face like I'm shooting knees
Yeah, Brain sends a message to poop and pee
Ey! keep your hands off me, you crazy? (fuck)
Brain is so over work
Brain just a curious being (yeah)
They won't even let brain rent a car, no
So he applied for a zip car
In the car like skrrt skrrt
How y'all business?
Brain is not gay (I don't know)
As far as he know
Everything softly
Do it all lowkey
Thinking 'bout hoagie (wa-woah)
When the fuck is lunch?
Brain love his lunch, ey
Brain love Edward Norton, yeah
Brain bring the boy millions, yeah
Brain still missing somethin'
