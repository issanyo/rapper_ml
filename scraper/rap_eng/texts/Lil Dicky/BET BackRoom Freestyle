[Verse 1: Lil Dicky]
Okay i'm buzzing cause i'm eloquent
Where I'm coming from is hyper-relevant
Cause I ain't seen a ton of us who prevalent
It's nothing but an impediment
I'm yelling "let 'em in" despite the fact my resume
Suggest above a president
I'm fresher than a peppermint
Actually I'm pretty underwhelming
When it comes to fashion and things
Try to focus on the rap, not distracted by things
Probably while when i get on the track I'm lapping the kings
Having a blings not a prio
Vile like a chubby youngin' who stumbled and wandered suddenly up into the snack aisle
Other words indecision was imminent
Rhythm and penmanship had me thinking "be Eminem-ish"
My predicament would lie with my ambition of joke
I'm funny like your favorite comedy when you smoke
So, came to mind i should probably combine em
Bring a lil LD Larry David to rhymin'
In my surprise
A lot of guys
Are quick to categorize
That as a gimmick
Like i'm spittin'
Like a kid who compromising
What is to better fit in
With the rest of the guys whose spittin'
Contradicting with Dicky been about from the beginning
But, I digress it's just a lot to attack
First of all it's really funny how the rest of you rap
If I mumble something dumb about me running the trap
Then i'd be another young redundancy who muttering crap
That'd be hard to defend like i'm playing with five
Only when i'm mini-golfing is when i'm playing with lies
That would be another foul right?
But i don't reach ref
I like to keep you all abreast
I don't mean chest
If i don't seem stressed
Baby i'm not
Lil David be hot
They bout to put my name on a yacht
But, someone tell me how to judge an mc
Probably think i'm really rapping
If it's lady's I freak
Mercedes I lease
The laziest weak
Debatably chic
Creatively fleek
Basic as tea but sorta
I threw the Spanish in to add swag
But, the way I'm starting to rap with these other tricks
It's like I'm their half dad
And I ain't mad at you no offense
But if you cold bro I know must be snowing pens
Cause if you call homie everybody goin' in
How bout you holla back when you rapping
I'll probably be napping
Or having a snack in the backroom
This is a feast
Way I'm rising on these rappers like I'm made up of yeast
Way I'm sizing up these actors I should hand you a cleat
You goin' in a couple brother and ballin' the scene mean
I don't play with you dog
Wanna muscle with the flow get a spotter involved
You couldn't see me in the post if you blogging my songs
Couldn't see me with the cloak harry potter put on
Couldn't see me like a ghost doin' nothin' at all
I'm taking over and they mad
Father in law Ahh
I'm the best you never heard about
Keep it real
I don't kill, but I murder doubt
It's been a year and I'm here
That's a turn around
Second guess my name, never question what the nerd about
I'm David Burd I'm out
Lil Dicky for word of mouth purposes
