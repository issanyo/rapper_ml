[Spoken: Lil Dicky]
Finally in Europe
Bup, ding bup
LD A.K.A Bup Bup
Ding bup
I can do what I want when I rap
Okay, that’s enough

[Verse 1: Lil Dicky]
Oh my god, I’m popping out in Europe
Oh, they slipping, gotta wipe the floor up
I’m the type of dude that never liked decorum
I give no fucks, I’m farting at the urinal
Mama used to call me Davey Wavy
Twenty years later, Davey wavy
I’m Russell Westbrook, the guard changing
Still push the same car, baby
Old whip, stilly on the map, new bitches in the back
They been fucking with the kid for a minute
Oh my my
Got ‘em looking like they ‘bout to go and let a motherfucker in to rip it like a ticket
I be going to bed like this
I don’t even gotta go and pretend I’m this
I don’t even gotta trip
Still in that London apartment like aye
My girl look like she got Parkinson’s, aye
I got her moving and shaking like ay
I’m coming first when I let her like ay
Turning up everywhere, Johnny Manziel
I got somebody else checking my mail
Hoes in formation, I’m feeling like Bey
I just don’t see how someone could debate
They don’t even like to post me on FADER
Fuck it, I’m what they all not
Labels they know it, they call lot
I got OGs in my call log
I can't name names
Just know I been great to the greatest
But, fuck it, it’s your blog
I bet they love this on Worldstar
No bugging me, that’s a girl car
Fifty just hit me like, damn homie
Go by Lil Dicky, I’m saying
Still, shit a landslide
How this shit be holding up with their hands tied
How this shit be blowing up, Nicki pants size
Could this shit break ground, that’s a landslide
Got hits, John Kruk with the hand-eye
You don’t see the light of day, I’m like a tan thigh
And I drop a video, ton of impressions
I look around, I see nothing but impressions

[Spoken: Lil Dicky (Tim Westwood)]
Not of me Tim, just of each other
(hmm)
Yeah, Tim Tim Tim Tim Tim
(That’s me baby)
I know, do you think I’m gonna meet my wife in London?
(I hope so)
She could be here, no?
(Yeah, waiting for you, baby)
Oh

[Verse 2: Lil Dicky]
Oh, they was sleeping, but now they awake
Is he a Drizzy or Louis CK?
If he was both of them bitches with both of them businesses, shit would be criggity-cray
Wish after wish like I’m blowing this cake
Bitch after bitch, they been hollering my name
Cling to my wood like a newborn koala
Cap on my shit when I twist like Odwalla
Okay, now they trying to get involved with it
No girl yet, I gotta see ‘em all first
No chain, I been trying to keep it all business
Lay it down like manure and the shit work
Drinking my water, I pick up a quarter
You know that the money get saved, ay whoa
Why you recording? Reporters recording the shit that I say, ay
I don’t even gotta downgrade it
I ain’t loving what I found lately
People look at me prayer hoping
People look at you Periscoping
I might have to be a tastemaker
This ain’t Iggy, but I date Lakers

[Spoken: Lil Dicky (Tim Westwood)]
I go out with them, sometimes
(Very cool)

[Verse 3: Lil Dicky]
Cut the losses, cut the bosses
Independent, fuck the office
At the Wingstop, bunch of sauces
Shout to Rick Ross, huh, bossing
I ain’t peak yet
I don’t p jet
Fly coach, Jay Wright shit
They send me Nikes, send me Reeboks
Got a new box, I ain’t peek yet
But I been skim milk chugging with a bitch hot as asphalt
Bitch wonder why I’m cumming quick, it’s your ass fault
Say what you want, I be saying shit later
You watching movies and wish you could date her
My life a movie, I think I might date her
I’d hit her on Twitter but I’m out of data

[Spoken: Lil Dicky]
I always run out of data
Is it ‘day-ta’ or ‘dah-ta’?
I hope it’s ‘day-ta’ for the sake of the rhyme
I even upgraded my plan
I swear, I do a lot of social media
Alright, thank you
