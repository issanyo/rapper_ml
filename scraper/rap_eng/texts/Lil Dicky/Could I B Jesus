[Intro: Lil Dicky]
Yuh
Just saying "yuh" sounds like you're jocking Drake
So annoying
L-I, L-I, L-I, L-I-L
Yuh, yuh

[Verse 1: Lil Dicky]
I used to go up to the Y, Friday nights
On the outskirts of Philly
I'm dropping dimes to this night
In an outskirts you feel me?
And I done been saving my good shit up
Old bitches now, yeah they would get up
Winklevoss twins, yeah I could get fucked
Chinese food, yeah I could get duck (ewuh)

[Bridge: Brain]
Brain give a fuck 'bout a' old bitch
Brain give a fuck 'bout dat hoeBrain got head in the snowlift
Brain cold ipso facto
Daggonit I'm ballin' (ooh)
Daggonit I'm ballin'

[Verse 2: Lil Dicky &  Brain ]
(Raise tha' ayy, ayy)
Ayy, one-two time for the sixers (yuh)
If this bitch get off on the wrong foot
Put her on the bench for a lil' Ben Simmons (ooh)
Like could, ride wood, like Jah doe
Still getta lick gelato
Feel like I hit the lotto
Brain never beg or grovel
Brain fucked Aunt Jemimah
I don't get head on the freeway (no)
That is forbidden like ebay (no)
She playing with Jimmy like D Wade (no)
She wanna stop at a BK
We don't go out, she a cheap date
I'm straight to the ass, like a cheesecake
We run this shit back like a replay
Mutual orgasm, we came

[Chorus: Brain]
(ahh, eyy)
Wait, could I be Jesus? (Wait, could I be Jesus?)
Wait, could I be Jesus? (Wait, could I be Jesus?)
Ey, could I be Jesus? (no way, no way, no way, way, way)
Hey, could I be Jesus? (could I be Jesus?)
Wait, could I be Jesus? (oh I think)
Holy Bejeezus
I might be Christ (oh my god)

[Verse 3: Lil Dicky & Brain]
Oh my word
Oh my god
I was overweight today but now I'm a model
I don't eat the pussy for free (ooh that dope brain)
Touchy, I get pussy, I be fucking these trees
(in love with spruce, spruce, ew, ewuh)
Ichiar deli my P got a nut out the purple like jelly
I'm buzzin' buzzin' like a left behind celly
My DM X-rated like critics, the Belly
I got the coldest cuts around like a deli, I (ayy)
Used to be in love with Aliyah (ayy)
Used to be in love with Daria (cartoon?)
Shit on these rappers like diarrhea
Brain with the dope like a mob boss (yah)
Chapo Chapo Chapo Brain (yah)
Stay with the peace like Gandhi
Blocka blocka, kno' what I'm sayin'? Yah
Brain like Mike, like Shad Moss
Brain like Mike, like shamone
Brain might fuck your bitch (hoo, hoo, hoo)
When he done, might ask your ass for a ride home (ride home)
Ayy, rollin' up the bud, rollin' up the club, rollin' up the work
Pourin' up the bub, blowin' up the drug
Leavin' out the back, damn this work (oh)
Haven't thrown a punch in about five years (oh)
Last time I did I broke my wrist
On my friend Glen's butt (ew)
Damn, that sucked (yuh)
Had to jerk off with the left hand
(but you learned your lesson!)
Ain't nobody in my category
I'm inventive with it like it's Scattergories (ah)
I was overdoubted, now I'm overcrowded (ah)
But I'm extroverted, don't you ever doubt it (ah)
Gotta lot of money, but I never count it (ah)
Competition fun, but they ain't never 'bout it (ah)
I was searching for it but I never found it (ah)
Like a' Oreo up in a power outage (Let's go!)


[Chorus: Brain]
(Brain!)
Wait, could I be Jesus? (Wait, could I be Jesus?)
Wait, could I be Jesus? (Wait, could I be Jesus?)
Ey, could I be Jesus? (no way, no way, no way, way, way)
Hey, could I be Jesus? (could I be Jesus?)
Wait, could I be Jesus? (oh I think)
Holy Bejeezus
I might be Christ (oh my god)

[Outro: Brain]
Aw man
I hope I'm not Jesus
But I... I also wanna get sucked
Brain
