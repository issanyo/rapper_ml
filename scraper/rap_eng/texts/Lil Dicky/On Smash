[Intro]
Brain
I'm Brain
I'm Brain

[Verse 1: Brain]
Brain fuck a hood bitch (sup, bitch)
Brain don't give a single fuck (no, no, no, never)
Brain'll look a grown man right up in his face
Tell that man he should toughen up (knuck or buck)
Brain fuck a ant mound (it's soft yo)
Brain fuck with cream cheese (the spread)
The Brain fuck with poppy seeds (texture)
The Brain don't even got a penis
Swin Cash, balling like a bitch
Whoa, Nelly, I'm the shit right now
Library tryna get it in
Tell that loud li'l bitch pipe down

[Chorus 1: Brain]
Brain got it on smash
Brain got the club jumpin'
(Brain got it on smash)
Everyday I wake up, get money, count it up
Do the math, Brain about to buy a new dick
Brain don't really give a damn at all (aw nah)
Lookin' at your bitch like damn, he wrong (him?)
Lookin' at your dick like damn, you soft
Lookin' at Lebron James brain like what's happenin'

[Verse 2: Lil Dicky and Brain]
Ayy, Young L, big pimpin', you can call me Shawn
Son of rappers, and I'm a bitch
You can call me mom
Hit me when you need that shit
Lil Dicky like the John
Jammin' like Lebron
Ey, like the Fonz, ey
Yo, fuckin' her good, yeah
Fuckin' her good, yeah
Good as I could, yeah
Good as I could, yeah
Ay, look at my bitch
Look at her lips
Look at her good hair
Why my girl look like she work for a department store or something?
Why my girl look like she working for a Macy's?
Why your bitch lookin' like she work and shop at Ross?
Where I know you from?
I seen you, I'm just struggling to place it (huh)
Why I got a bitch butt-naked in the bath tub, while I'm in the shower that's adjacent?
I can see her contemplating masturbation
Hope she doesn't, that'd be weird
But I get it (woop)
I also got the neck so long like a giraffe
Suck on titties like a calf
Went a few rounds like a draft (yo)
Still got bitches
Still got bitches (yeah, yeah)
Still not different
Still not different (yeah, yeah)
I swear to God I'm bout to fuck Julia Roberts (swear)
I think a star is afoot we should converse
Baby I've been down south kickin' shit
Outhouse with the shit
Mike WiLL told me he was proud of my penmanship (thanks)
Brain feeling limitless
Dave, lemme finish this
Okie dokie Brain am I great? Like an immigrant

[Bridge: Brain]
Brain (Brain), fuckin (fuckin), like (like)
He was Timberlake with his bad bitch (Jessica Biel)
Brain ain't got no dick but she don't care
I got no hair
Picture Brain rollin' 'round with a broke person, hmm
Picture that, yeah
Picture Brain rollin'  'round with the windows open
Screamin, "I'm Brain!"

[Chorus 2: Brain]
Brain got it on smash
Brain got the club jumpin'
(Brain got it on smash)
Everyday I wake up, get money, count it up
Do the math, Brain about to buy a new dick
Brain got it on smash
(Brain got it on smash)
Brain whoop yo bitch ass
(Brain gon' whoop yo bitch ass)
Not yo bitch like your girl, but you
You a bitch Brain would never hit a girl
Motherfuck your bitch

[Outro: Lil Dicky and Brain]
I be looking at her like Fnnnnnn

I be looking at her like Fnnnnnn
I be looking at her like Eeeeeeeeeegh
Lemme get it

Every-every other brain can't even measure up
See me then
