(Beat is "Uptown" by Drake)
[Freestyle starts at 3:20]

We could start with the rap
Flowing like malls, like "Oh, there's a Gap"
Go in my call-log dogs, wanna chat
Big dogs
Missed calls

A lot of mother fuckers in the league know L
And I just had brunch with Embiid and Noel
And I just got fucked and sucked by a dumb slut
Usually I like 'em Ivy league, oh well

Summer camp, I've been going HAM
Young man with that chopper
Thatâ€™s riflery, I like movies
I'm going HAM for that Oscar

I'm way far from their radar, like they know I'm coming, that's doppler
They're boring to me, that's opera
I'm scoring beauties like soccer

Me and Jonah Hill smoked, then we talk shit 'bout how the rest of y'all blow
Then we take a dip up in his pool, pretty cool, not the pool, shit is hot, just the view from the spot, shit is hot, bunch of blonde bitches laughing all night

Me and Busta Rhymes meet in Venice for a bite
Talked some shit about the comedy scene
"That shit is so light", he tell me
Can't disagree, "get it right", he tell me
I mean...

I thought by now he could see that I'm witty
Down in LA, I've been running the city
Ask anybody in music and film, "who got next in this bitch?", and they all saying "Dicky"

I just do it like there's nothing to it
Life gettin' pretty sweet like I fondue it
I'm killing bitches in my lane on some T Stewart
And I've been scoring prevent yeah the dime blew it

I'm the man, bro
Ion't really care what the fuck you think
And my steak look rare, but I grub that pink
And the grundle stink
And I bump NSYNC

Don't suck dick, but I blow that good
Don't want shit, but a ho that would
Lemme hold that, ben and fold that
Get a Kodak, cowboy, Jerry Jones that, lemme own that

Fuck that girl
I got hair, never cut them curls
And it's truth or dare, with a cute au pair
Get a room to share, hit a boom Pat Burrell

Spit that turd, that's that shit
Yo girl up on my dick
I'm 'bout to sperm up on them hips
Don't want to murder us a kid
Oh shit
What you say?
Don't you do this everyday?
Don't you usually go with double meat when you eat Chipotle?

Don't your crew lack someone black, but you want one to hang? No slave
I heard your boo got so much back, she bangin' that Notre Dame clock

I'm faded, tho
Fucking bitches you'd label undatable
Missing birthdays, ay belated, bruh

Naked out in San Fran on that roof top
Tan cans, no tube top

I'm the mother fucking man, god damn, and these mother fucker bitches full of shit like zoo mops
