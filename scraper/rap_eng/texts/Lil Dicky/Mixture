[Chorus: Price]
Bitches, bud and liquor (Bitches, bud and liquor)
That's the perfect mixture (That's the perfect mixture)
Call the plug for pick up (brrrrt)
We came to turn this bitch up (turn it up!)
Bitches, bud and liquor (Bitches, bud and liquor)
That's the perfect mixture (That's the perfect mixture)
Girl, pull up with your sisters (pull up, pull up)
We came to turn this bitch up (yeh, yeah!)

[Verse 1: Price]
Your girls and all my niggas (yup, yup)
That's the perfect mixture (yup, yup)
You know you in the midst of greatness (go)
I got a list of great shit that you can do
Like bong rips 'til you're wasted (c'mon)
Humpin' at my mom crib in the basement (c'mon)
She pullin' out that long dick in amazement (whoa!)
I'm like, "Girl, you know how I does it" (yeah!)
That's the reason that you love it (woo)
'Cause I'm the same nigga whether private or public
If I'm in the Benz or a bucket, or I'm ridin' buses
Real is the only way I'm comin'
I'm jiggy baby (jiggy baby)
Fresh prince feelin' jiggy baby (jiggy baby)
Only smokin' out the pretty ladies
Rest in peace City, baby, yeah the city made me
Ooh a nigga wavy (yeah)

[Chorus: Price]
Bitches, bud and liquor (Bitches, bud and liquor)
That's the perfect mixture (That's the perfect mixture)
Call the plug for pick up (Call the plug for pick up)
So we can turn this bitch up (So we can turn this bitch up)
Bitches, bud and liquor (Bitches, bud and liquor)
That's the perfect mixture (That's the perfect mixture)
Girl, pull up with your sisters (pull up with your sisters)
And we can turn this bitch up (turn this bitch up)

[Interlude 1: Price]
Now this is the part of the jam where
You realize that life is something that is limitless and
You can do anything as long as love is involved
And you are doing it with the purest intentions that you could possibly do it in
And you... uh, have kush in your system

[Verse 2: Lil Dicky]
Overnight I'm pimpin'
Aw, I'm Mike you Pippen
Oh, I'm like a Christian
Paul, I'm on a mission
Ok onto bitches
Ok onto bitches
I do well with bitches
Burnin' weed and bridges, aw man
'Cause she don't know me though
I'm scared that she might overdose
I'm square like she don't know me though
I'm fair but she hop on that pole
Aw man, I might just give in to demons
I might just give her the penis
I will not show her my penis
I will control all the lighter
Damn girl, what you mean you got a boyfriend?
Talkin' to me all damn night like the boy band
Big trend, we was in sync like a boy band
Now you sayin' gettin' laid off, unemployment
Don't be takin' Dave wrong, I enjoyed it

[Interlude 2: Lil Dicky]
I'm just saying, like, I don't live here
So... like, I'm-I have very limited time and I feel like it's
It's honestly borderline unreasonable that you would
Devote that much time to something that you knew was never gonna end up in anything
And I'm actually bothered by it 'cause now like I've honestly wasted time
No disrespect, but like, I could've met someone else

[Verse 3: Oktane]
She wanna come through and take my mind off my ex
(Good girls don't party hard enough, good girls)
Yes, 'cause she wanna come through and take my mind off my ex
(Good girls don't party hard enough, good---)
Yeah, I think I'ma let her, huh
I'ma let her come through
I'ma let her walk around
I'm a let her strip, it's crazy uppers make her down
(Shots make me talk nasty)
Yeah I'ma let her feel the potion
I'm the reason that she smokin'
Psychedelics got her open
Skinny dippin' in her ocean
Now she cummin', nigga oh shit
Back down to Earth, we in the bathroom, fix your hair baby
Do I think they heard us? Heaven yeah baby
Look in the mirror and your hair crazy
My back scratched, your legs still trippin'
In the party and we still with it
They dancin' and we still kissin'

[Hook: Price]
Bitches, bud and liquor (Bitches, bud and liquor)
