Girl, what's your name? How you tryna get at me?
Like I ain't really one to fuck a bitch that like celebrities
I'm planting seeds: sesame, got you open sesame
And wetter than the Chesapeake, yes, I'm talking sexually
Uh, girl, you got it all and some
The only other chicken I been eating come with bread-crumbs
The only other shit that I been kissing is my lip-balm
'Cause all these other bitches comin' second like a stepmom
Yes, I'm tryna suck your titties, tryna touch your kitty
And rumour has it that vagina fuck with Lil Dicky
So what you tryna do? I gotta condo with a pool
No I don't, it just sounded cool, but I gotta hot tub
Sweeter than some hot fudge, you should probly meet me at the spot 'cause

Got drugs, well weed, vodka, help me
This bottle and this cock will not get finished by themselves
Do to the
