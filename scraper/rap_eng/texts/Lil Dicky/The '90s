Ay what's up y'all
It's ya boy L-D
A.K.A. white jesus

[Verse 1]
Man I wish I was a kid
Thinking bout the third grade
Back in '96 in my Michael Jordan jersey
French fries curly, cool with it, raising Tamagachis
Dick three and a half, the same as a floppy
Nerf guns loaded and we shootin' at y'all mafuckas
We ain't getting hoes, but we getting soda
And we was fucking with the swag of The Fresh Prince
Ain't nothing like when you had mad tokens left in
That arcade balling
Watching tickets falling
Pegging stupid bitches in that motherfucking ball pit
Landline calling
Chillin' at the mall
And if this the type of shit that you recall well then

[Hook]
Let me hear you shout
If you grew up in the 90's
Then you know what I'm about
Don't you wish we could rewind it
I wish we could, man I really miss it
'cause we having fun all day
Slept all night
Best ten years of our whole damn lives
Blowing on a cartridge, lot of fucking farting
I would give it all up, if I could restart it

[Verse 2]
Sittin' on the school bus
Flippin' through some Goosebumps
A minute 'til I'm shitting out the school lunch
Wanna know what cool was?
Starter jackets, Jock jams, and Pop Rocks
Sega in my room, baby boom shaka laka
Lotta slammers in my pocket, flippin' them pogs
And I knew every modem noise in ma AOL login
On that Oregon Trail
With Keenan & Kel
I was jerkin' off daily, TRL
But that Saved by the Bell
Was on some fuckin' hot shit
OJ to jail, oh wait that glove did not fit
Short shorts Stockton
Beanie Baby profits
And NBA on NBC if you remember watching

[Hook]
Let me hear you shout
If you grew up in the 90's
Then you know what I'm about
Don't you wish we could rewind it
I wish we could, man I really miss it
Cause we having fun all day
Slept all night
Best ten years of our whole damn lives
Blowing on a cartridge, a lot of fucking farting
I would give it all up, if I could restart it

[Verse 3]
Remember getting greeted with Scholastic mags
I hated reading but it made me need that shit so bad
And we was spin that bottle, de-prude hoes
Winning full throttle, Nintendo
Switch the flow up, getting donuts
Fruit roll ups, wishing we could be a grown up
Being so dumb, fucking with the kid, call me Lil Dicky Griffey
And my koosh balls big, man I think I had fifty
Love those Mentos ads
There were ten boy bands
I had ten ring pops on my hands
Plus I love that Nick at Nite time
Kicks had lights
Shine brighter than some tights when they was tag team fighting
Shout out to Topanga
Fuck you know about Jenga?
Best head ever from a Pez dispenser

[Hook]
Let me hear you shout
If you grew up in the 90's
Then you know what I'm about
Don't you wish we could rewind it
I wish we could, man I really miss it
Cause we having fun all day
Slept all night
Best ten years of our whole damn lives
Blowing on a cartridge, a lot of fucking farting
I would give it all up, if I could restart it

Outro
Yeah, that's a little trip down memory lane for you
Ay, I used to sign online and tell bitches that I liked them
Like, a lot
That was really the only way I could get girls was through AIM
It's a lot harder now, like to have to like, go up and speak to them in person
And AIM, with AIM, I was killing it
Like, just crazy paragraphs, sweet, real sweet guy
Uh, okay, so long
