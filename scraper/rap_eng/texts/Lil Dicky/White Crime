[Intro]
Lot of rappers talking that shit, not enough doing that shit
You know what I'm saying?

[Verse 1]
Yeah, people acting like I ain't a fucking criminal (aight bruh)
Like I ain't never doing dirt though
Prolly ‘cause the way I'm doing shit is clinical
Yeah
But I've been putting in some work, brah
I see you looking at me cynical (stop looking at me)
I ain’t fucking with your smirk, hoe (it's condescending)
We been doing shit despicable (no sleep)
But we just keep it on the low, for example
Walk in to the movie with my pants full
Twix, bag of chips, plus a snapple
Stealing all the shampoos from the hotel's pretty bathrooms
Cheating, I've been peeking in the classroom
Looking like a nice guy, till I take your motherfucking Wi-Fi
And torrent every single song in my library
Then I drive while very fucking high by everybody
While my lady licking my five-inch dick

[Hook]
White crime (white crime)
White crime (white crime)
Yeah, we 'bout that, do a lot of dirt, never doubt that
Lotta rap twerps love to shout crap
Love to make they mouth flap
When it come to Burd, know he spout facts
You gon’ learn what I'm 'bout, brah

[Verse 2]
Doing business at the airport (I travel a lot for work)
At security, I ain't fraught
Lot of shit up in my JanSport
Six ounce of the face wash (the limit three)
My duffle bigger then what can board (That’s a big ass bag)
My shuffle on during take off (she don’t know)
Will I help in an emergency? Yeah, sure
Exit row, fingers straight crossed
Thinking Dave's soft but I know you see me jaywalking
Piss in public, no caution
Halloween bucket, take one, fuck you thinking Dave was?
Give me all your motherfucking chocolate, ho
(Fuck you gonna do)
At the stop sign, never fully stopping though
Filling water cups up with a lot of Coke
Egging homes, motherfucker, a lot of yolk
Not alone up in this motherfucker, a lot of folks, been doing...

[Hook]
White crime (white crime)
White crime (white crime)
Yeah, we 'bout that, do a lot of dirt, never doubt that
Lotta rap twerps love to shout crap
Love to make they mouth flap
When it come to Burd, know he spout facts
You gon’ learn what I'm 'bout, brah

[Verse 3]
Even though the speeding limit sixty-five
I'm doing seventy-five without a seat belt on
And I've been texting, driving reckless
I was seventeen when I first tried a Guinness, on the tennis team
We used to haze a lot of freshmen
Lil Dicky put a hoop up in the street
Without obtaining permission
From the city and every Christmas day
I'm going to cinemas with single tickets to single flicks
But go to additional pictures, sorry, but your boy is malicious
And back when I was eighteen, statutory raping
This little hoe, even though we was dating
And if I am taking public transportation
On the quiet train I might have a conversation
Fuck it I'm the man, putting trash up in some other people’s cans though
At the work fridge, stealing can Coke
And up at the holiday party, I'm grinding colleagues on the dance floor
Dick been rubbing against their assholes, say it's not...

[Hook]
White crime (white crime)
White crime (white crime)
Yeah, we 'bout that, do a lot of dirt, never doubt that
Lotta rap twerps love to shout crap
Love to make they mouth flap
When it come to Burd, know he spout facts
You gon’ learn what I'm 'bout, brah
