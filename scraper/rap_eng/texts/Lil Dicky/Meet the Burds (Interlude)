JEAN: Hello?
DAVE: Hi, any better out here?
JEAN: Yeah, much better, yeah.
STEWART: Buenos noches.
DAVE: You’re back from Machu Picchu and you’re speaking Spanish?
JEAN: It’s ‘buenas tardes’
STEWART: So how’s Dave Burd doing?
DAVE: Ah, he’s alright, you know. Taking it one day at a time.
STEWART: Um…
JEAN: Well, wait, can we hear… say a little bit more about what that means?
DAVE: Uh, yeah, I mean, I’m here in LA, I just moved here, obviously.
STEWART: Wait, wait, wait, we’re still having trouble. Maybe you should try to call him back, Jean.
JEAN: He’s got bad reception where he is is the problem.
DAVE: Can you hear me?
STEWART: Is that it?
DAVE: Can you hear me?
JEAN: Yes, now I can. Yep.
DAVE: Alright.
STEWART: No, now we can’t.
JEAN: Wait, Stewart, let him talk. Go ahead.
DAVE: What do you mean 'You can’t'? Why can’t… You can’t hear me?
JEAN: Yes. We can, go ahead.
STEWART: Did you see that commercial for Anchorman 2?
DAVE: Which one? There’s plenty of commercials.
JEAN: Ok, Stewart, let him talk about what’s going on with him.
STEWART: Alright, go ahead.
