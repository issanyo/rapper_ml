[Brain &  Lil Dicky]
Brain, you're so cute
Aight
I just..I felt really in the moment there, the way the light is just glistening off of your creases
I...I'm tryna focus, bro
Okay, okay. Can I do one song like without you on this project?
Without me?
No, it'll still be your song, but you'll be more like a DJ Khaled of it. Like..the organizer, the facilitator as oppo- like, you know, you pick the rappers but I just wanna go really hard like really bad without you be-
What makes you think I'd even pick you, bro?
Well, c'mon, Brain. We both know that you would pick me
Well this shit better be hard, bro
