I like to play it cool like I'm not that
On the low who’d assume that I got that?
I don’t know but the dude with the tall frappe
Looking aloof, being all that
Even Babe Ruth wouldn't call that
I don't even sweat it tho
They be hesitant as if my credit low
But the shit will hit em quicker then an edible
I'm bout to run for Senate ho
You won't even centerfold
Been on top of cheese I ain’t talkin' ‘bout oregano
I'm talkin' about yo cheddar homie
I hit a college and I’m fucked like I’m pledging a frat
They bout to silhouette up my nuts on American flags
Estoy contento, I'm muy estupendo
Everybody know the cat like a dope meme
I got em buzzin' on the crack like a dope fiend
They saw em' come up with a Mac ya I'm so Steve
Now a days bitches tryin' crack got em od-ing
How them hoes wanna get it with L
They know its cold enough to charge like a letterman sale
If they gonna stand behind the bars I'm in federal jail
I’m goin’ far like a general mail
Sway I got the fellas sayin what up
The tape what up
Same muhfucka playing with the steak cut up
I'm great shut up
The flow ain't no debate, just us
I’m out of shape, but I’m straight to fuck
You know I got a chicken in the condo
I'm was sick of getting off beat she a bongo
She playing with the hard D, Rondo
Go inside her all sweet like a Strongbow
How imma do?
I got your X comin' next like a W do
I gotta flex I'm the best now I'm being direct
I’m unimpressed by these bitches that I see in the press
I kinda of vexxed by the trash like I'm cleanin' the mess
Cuz they as real when they rap as a chias a pet
Old news stocks plummet, mens leg hair, they dont cut it
Forget about your era, Pat Summit
Best writtens, I'm trying to get a hundred bitches to fuck with the spittin religious like a couple of us marital Christians
Been official Dick Bevetta A livin
Betta' dig it like you bitches got a mill and a ditch
And I’m killin' this shit, I be kickin' like a villainous ninja
Gripping when I run it how the fuck I be slippin'
I be intimate with them hoes, she never flummoxed
Take chick's P, and smash, I call her hummus
And I be funny with this shit I'm just playing
Still nobody fuckin' with the kid I'm just sayin'
Got a chicken parm on a date, ya see
But I don't even know the broad she just gratin the cheese
I don't even got a job I just blaze and free
They still give the boy bands 98 degrees
So come fuck with me
I got a  couple hun'ed bitches doin' drugs with me
I got a couple dozen bitches tryin' to hug Dicky
And I got a couple bitches who be steady fucking me
Aye that's a good ass life
Only thing I got left, find a good as wife
But yo I gotta hit these hoes first, don’t tell mom
In a year I'ma bend over Michelle Obama
I gotta do it while I'm hot
Tryna get blue in most states like Barack
I’m tryna show a boo the last name of the Rock
And put up on D til we owe J Watt
I never hit the scene
When I'm do I'm high n wasted
I'm fuckin' with them jeans
Love them bitches high-waisted
I run around your team
You a player but I’m Naismith
I command v, while you copy, I just paste it
Face it
Hotel got em puffin on da L
Going harder than some hail, y'ain't knew it
If everybody had to tell the truth, and you had to pick a dude spittin better than ya dude, can’t do it, Sway talk to em
