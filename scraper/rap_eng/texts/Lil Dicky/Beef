[Intro]
What's up y'all?
It's Dicky, AKA chipotle aioli
Uh, basically I just love it when rappers is beefing at one another. It gives you like a chance to kinda act kinda tough, but, nobody really cares about me to the point where they'd ever be beefing at me, so I kinda just made up an arbitrary rapper to come at over a hard beat
So

[Verse 1]
Cause if you really talkin' shit bruh
I suggest you take a sec and recognize ma shit raw
I been texting pictures atcho sister, be ma in-law
You know I been spittin' vicious, whatchu fittin' to get at ma dude
I been killin' bitches, Michael Vick in the booth
The US see me, I be Kiffin to you
I gotcho bitch up on ma stick she ride it sick
Like it was quidditch but nude
And I'm the honorary Gryffindor Jew
And I don't care about ya bitch, or ya ya, ya riches or ya whips bro
Even though you fictional, I'm guessing that you get dough
No you don't exist, but I see through you like a window
Dicky run this shit and you'sa cripple
Fuck it though, you dumber than Waka Flocka
Be sonnin' you like a father
D bomber than Osama plot
And smart as Obama
Gotcho lil mama in the sauna all up
In the male locker room
She really good with the D
That's my Serge Ibaka boo, ooh
Das dat dude, spittin' hot as Rihanna
You softer than llamas
Do primadonnas faster than Ramadan
I'll be honest, getting commas in ma wallet
Is nada, ebonically smarter, the kike
Been flowin' nice as the Dalai Lama
Whaddup bruh
I'm goin' stupid cause I'm better
This the hottest shit like I was pooping in a sweater
Ain't nobody do you anymore, you a letter
You get it write? That was clever
Ho'
But look

[Hook]
If you think you on ma level jabroni
Than let me educate you, bet you need a fellowship homie
Lil Dicky rippin' dat ribbon cause what he spittin' is winning
So if you finna be some chicken for dinner
Then hollaback up at the kid boy
I'm spittin' good up in this bitch ho
So if you tryna get at me you better get a Mento, ahhh
That's word to ads from the past
Ya ass up in a jam if you come at the man
Then yon't stand a chance

[Verse 2]
Das retard flow
I been talkin' game on campuses I'm Lee Corso
Battle me, he'll be like, "Dude I ran." see Argo
Package all up in this dude caboose...free cargo
Fuck it. I'm really talkin' that shit
I'm coming at a muthafucka that don't even exist
But if we under the assumption that he
Someone dat spit it redundant to someone incumbent
Then he dumber than bricks, ya dig?
Listen to these bitches making hits and
You'll see the horrendousness dat be existing
Every minute some kid is diminishing a single
Written like a semi-retarded kid in kindergarten
Except he harder than me so poor Lil Dicky is
Stuck
Watching stupid muthafuckers
Make music and caking foolish
While Jewish muthafuckas rate movies
OkCupid to do a lil fuckin'
But if it's bout the rap, they on't want it
That's why I tell em look

[Hook]
If you think you on ma level jabroni
Than let me educate you, bet you need a fellowship homie
Lil Dicky rippin' dat ribbon cause what he spittin' is winning
So if you finna be some chicken for dinner
Then hollaback up at the kid boy
I'm spittin' good up in this bitch ho
So if you tryna get at me you better get a Mento, ahhh
That's word to ads from the past
Ya ass up in a jam if you come at the man
Then yon't stand a chance

[Outro]
Say I didn't kill that dude man
Ay you can't blame me for like
Wanting to be tough once
Uh for those of you wondering
Why I'm on the toilet
First thing I'll say is mind your business
But like second off, it's cause I wanted to hammer home the point that I was like shittin' on him
Like literally I took it to that level
Which, like, I could understand the argument against that
It is questionable
I, y'know, I might end up regretting this in the long run
But, y'know, uh, man, we got some much fucking mexican coke in this bitch man
Man, shout out my connect, taco bar
Bringing that shit in from Mexico like it's nothing
That's that good shit
Uh, anyway, So Hard, that's online
Peep that, hollaback
Stop saying hollaback! I say hollaback way too much for somebody who never says hollaback
Uh, the beat cut off so, this is acapella
And goodbye
