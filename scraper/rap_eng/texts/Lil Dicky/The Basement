[Intro]
Wasup yo? let me preface this by saying this is not a Mac Miller diss by any means
I actually like Mac Miller but, but right now he  probably is the most popular white rapper excluding Eminem
And I'm just not even close so you can understand why I would rap over one of his beats
I got a little bit of Kobe in me and if Kobe saw like Lebron he would wanna rap over his beat
Metaphorically speaking, I know he ain't Lebron, but, but you get what the fuck I'm saying
Maybe he's more of a Jo Johnson type of shit, no disrespect

[Verse 1]
Fuck...this undergrad bitch tryn fuck
And her chest deserves an A, like she handle da puck
She know D been bumpin' Drake like ya man a Canuk
Homie even if it's May in LA...I'm so fuckin' cold

Roll good on that Westside
Hoes cook like they country thick
So hood up in Best Buy
Controller, D punkin' kids

Loading up the used dishes
Rollin' up wit two bitches
Hope they old enough
To get folded up, I'm not bold enough to do prison

I been drinkin' sippin' something so horrific, ya dig it
Because I tipped the bartender extra, then he put extra liquor
In dat shit. Goddamn. Das a misinterpreta-tion
Hate it when they stiff. Over-tipping 'cause I'm cak-ing

Take in errything a mafucka say
Been about rap, figured out that from the basement
I ain't talkin bout rap city on black entertainment
Talkin bout the place I was raised in
Plate full uh bacon
Making a bagel and bake on occasion

Back then woulda made rap for grades
Now a mafucka make rap for pay
And them bitches too
Chickens that I'm bangin' so appealing
They been Shagging on ma balls, like they practicing they fielding and
I Sorta make 'em pop off
Make 'em take they socks off
Round the fuckin' bases then get pounded like a walk off

Aw naw...
This a fucking statement I'm making
They been hesitating to give Lil David space at the table
'cause they label a capable able Jew gay and too playful
Watching cable naked, the AC blowin' major like Slater's dad

Why you hater's mad?
Maybe I should get a couple tats
Maybe I should get in trouble and be dumbin' down the rap
Look at Mac
White as fuck but lookin' thugger than a trap spot
Need another mac 'stead of luggin' round this laptop

Blackballed
From the muthafuckin' rap blogs
'cause I rap odd, never talkin' bout a fuckin' black card
Ion't gotta play da black card, 'cause I rap hard
Ion't think it mean I gotta act hard

Fuck it tho
Despite dat LD straight fucking hoes
Ma chickens stay hot, no buffalo
Ma hand been up in her bod, no Muppet ho

Whatcha know bout a mafuckin' kid up wit a job
Coulda fit in wit the mob, had a kid and a garage
But I didn't now I'm spittin' like a mothafuckin' slob
Doin' shit up in garageband, better than the gods of the game do

Y'all better know ma name soon
I ain't no clown, when you laughin' out loud
Don't forget you getting down to a great tune

Make room
I'm coming for you muthafuckin rappers spittin' dog shit
Yeah I'm fuckin' funny, but this muthafuckin' dog spit
Aw shit...I could write a TV show tomorrow
But before I get dat Emmy I'ma make you bitches sorry that I'm gone

[Outro:Lil Dicky]
Yeah, and once again no disrespect to Mac, Mac I actually follow you on Vine, I'm fucking with you, it looks like your having a pretty ridiculous amount of fun,
Sometimes your at a pool, sometimes your smoking weed and rapping
Would love to be a part of it,if vine is any indicator your life is awesome
Okay I got to go to work, see ya
