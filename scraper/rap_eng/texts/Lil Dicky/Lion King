[Intro]

[Verse:]
Now look at all these motherfuckers out on Pride Rock
Lot of livestock, think it's 'cause Sarabi ride cock
Or she did once 'cause they celebrating Simba
Li'l cub, everybody gotta kneel cause
Deal was, lions was some motherfucking real thugs
And the fear of being turned into a meal was
Such a fright yo, but on the real they hella nice though
This specific pack of lions acting like some white folks
But Africa is full of brothers, one is Uncle Scar
And that motherfucker wasn't nothing funny son, he hard
And he mad too 'cause he just want to be the man too
First it was his brother, now another king is brand new
Baboon drawing on a tree, you dig?
There's something freaky 'bout Rafiki, bet his weed legit
That motherfucking monkey doesn't need comedians
The reason is, he laughing at the breeze and shit, it's weird
All right, now back to the plot
Mufasa was a wonderful father, he loved him a lot
And Simba wanted to impress him every second he got
The young'n was taught but then, one afternoon, he forgot
Thas when he holler'd at Nala, to follow da balla
To crawl up in the squalor
Where all of the lollers acknowledge his father
But they never gave a fuck 'bout a little bitty pup
Aw shucks, they going to eat this motherfucker up
Until his dad came through, and smacked them bitches in the head
Could've had em dead, but he let em runaway instead
Now he really mad at dude, he cute when he sad though
And the simple truth, Simba doing what his dad do
Shit, now that's some real talk homie
But he can't own them fields wit them little paws homie
And real dogs only bark at bitches when they gotta do
Taught him to, think when he at the line like an audible
And now the part I abhor
Little Simba chilling with a chameleon, perfecting his roar
Could a been a gecko but that shit echoed, effecting the gorge
Was accidental, but you know what's in store, the stampede scene
Shit and he was all up on a stick, gotta hold a grip
Simba you done got up in some shit
But his dad came through, and he saved him man
But as he climbed with them wounds, Mu raised his hands
But dude his brother on some motherfucking scar face
Scar face, lit up like a motherfucking star'n space
Hard place, and a rock, Mufussa caught up in between that
That's his brother but that brother was a mean cat
And when he threw him off the ledge
Simba couldn't believe that that motherfucker dead
Tears being shed, Scar got up in his head
More dread for the boy, so he ran away and fled
Timon and Pumba time
The young cub grown up, what a beautiful lion
They grub bugs, cub's nuts hitting puberty while
The voice of change up, Ferris Bueller style, ya know
And they was trying to eat a beetle
A lion came through, trying to dine, hella regal
Then Pumba got stuck, 'bout to get his ass cut
But then Simba stepped up, and defended like a thug do
Rolling round he realized who it was too
Hollered back at Nala like what's up boo?
Hugged smooth, confused
Nala looking pretty, titties done grew
Butt cute, he 'bout to fuck soon
Then he nuzzled from the back and he cuddled from the front
He was really macking jawn, she all up on his junk
You could see me jacking off to the scene, believe that
The young me, fucking around wit cats, I need that
To recap, lot of feedback, Simba react
The fam need that...but your man can't be back
He just want to do his thing, you dig?
But he the king, even thought he wasn't feeling it
Until he met up wit the monkey, what a funky fucking junkie
But he spunky, told that motherfucking lion 'bout his country
And he ran back, Pride Rock got its man back
But damn...the whole land hella ransacked
And then he saw Scar with his mom
Sarabi looking hella worn, hidden Simba looked on
As Scar did her like a dog, hit her hard wit his palm
For real dog? All right you fucking with the god now
Long growl. pimping handle business like a boss now
Tossed down, talking shit to Simba, 'bout to cost clown
Scar tell the young'n that he killed his pops though
For real motherfucker? He revealed his hops bro
And clocked on that motherfucking sucker with a cross
Rocked uncle with a couple then he sunk him wit a toss
He don't play that shit, brothers and lacrosse
Real talk, the dogs done finished him off
And Pride Rock was back where it started at
The meals back, fields packed wit the hardest cats
For real jack, the animals is feeling that
The real is back and I just spit the realest rap, ya know
And Simba must've hit it hella freaky
Gotta keep it PG but you see Rafiki with the peewee baby
That right there mean he murking it right
The dude piped but that's just the circle of...life
