[Intro: Brain and Lil Dicky}
Brain
LD
You mix some Brain with some LD

[Hook 1: Lil Dicky]
Never even done cocaine
I've never even done cocaine
I never even tried it, never even tried it
Never even tried it, you know I ain't lying
Never even done cocaine
I've never even done cocaine
I never even tried it, never even tried it
Never even tried it, I've been close-minded

[Verse 1: Lil Dicky]
Party girl, party girl
Out in LA with a party girl
I was all good with Bacardi, girl
Now she tryin' to up the ante
I was kinda drunk and handsy
Johnson looking long like Randy
Hoping that my pitch is strong
Now she's like "let's do some bumps"
Ew, chill I don't do that (Ew!)
Poured a rail and she blew that
Now I'm scared, I look pussy
Spark the blunt 'cause I do that
She was sniffing that Tom Hanks
I was just sipping Chris Brown
She keep on sniffing that Zeus (Coke)
I keep my eyes on the ground
She like "don't knock it 'till you try it"
That's some bullshit (yeah, I know)
Just do a line of this Betsy Ross
I started thinking, can't deny I'm a pussy
Like as a child I was so dissmissive of the baked potato 'till I tried that shit
Now the baked potato is my favorite kind potato
Now she got me wondering what else I left on the table
Twenty-eight, I still ain't done no anal (true)
And I'm unusually skeptical
But man oh man this bitch was raw
So I asked her for some Molly
She like "start with Miley"
I'm like "give me Molly"
Crazy 'cause I

[Hook 2: Lil Dicky]
Never even done cocaine
I've never even done cocaine
I never even tried it, never even tried it
Never even tried it, you know I ain't lying
Never even done cocaine
I've never even done cocaine
I never even tried it, never even tried it
Now I'm doing Molly, I hope I survive it

[Verse 2: Brain]
Brain
Flippin' a bitch and I'm poppin' this shit and I don't really feel it yet
He never done it before and I'm worried I'll feel neglect
But I ain't trippin'
Balmain, Brain 'bout to get to kissing
I'm sauced up, fucking with this breezy boo
Haven't eaten since four, man I need some food
Why these broke people looking at me? (you broke)
I'm feeling good and happy
Hold up the Molly kicking in now
I think I should sit down
Brain for the win now
I think we should dip now, girl let me know (we should dip)
Brain overwhelmed losing control of this front lobe (hello)
I was G'd up, now I'm T'd up
Like a ball playing motherfucker in Atlanta
Shout to Dwight Howard
In case she didn't let him (ew!)
And now I'm puking
Girl I blew it, but I was just doing my j-o-b

[Verse 3: Lil Dicky and Brain]
Brain, what the fuck is going on?
The molly got me shakin' and clenchin' on the jaw
It got me going crazy (It got me going crazy)
How the fuck you blame me?
You the one that popped MDMA
When you never ever even done cocaine
Never even done cocaine
Never even tried
Oooh Brain

[Hook 1: Lil Dicky]
I never even done cocaine
Never even done cocaine
I never even tried it, never even tried it
Never even tried it, you know I ain't lying
I never even done cocaine
I never even done cocaine
I never even tried it, never even tried it
Never even tried it, I've been close-minded

[Outro: Lil Dicky]
I never even done cocaine
Never even done cocaine (that Paul Rudd!)
I never even tried it, never even tried it (Sue Bird)
Never even tried it, you know I ain't lying (Meryl Streep)
I've never even done cocaine (Like Joan of Arc!)
I never even tried it, never even tried it (that Ross Perot)
Never even tried it, I've been close-minded (Betty Boop)
