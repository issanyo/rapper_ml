[Skit: Lil Dicky and Brain]
Cool Brain
Y'know, I think you might be better off
Focusing just a bit more
What, whatchu mean I'm f-
I'm locked in bro I'm
Whatchu mean?
No it sounds cool and all I'm just saying
Like you know
Maybe it could be a little less random
Or if you-
Man, don't get all high and mighty on me bro
My shit a wave bro
Fuck outta here with that shi...
No totally, and I like your music
I think it's-- I like it
I just think I'd love it
Man
Let's just come up with some ideas for you
Like top- like song topics and shit that's what you sayin'?
Yeah exactly let's brainstorm some topics
Ohhh no you said brainstorm?

[Intro: Lil Dicky and Brain]
Uhh  (Brain gotta think)
Yeah, just a brainstorm
Brain don't even know
What's going on?
Usain Brain, they call me Usain Brain 'cause I'm fast
Brain in the club
Brain thinking up stuff
Brain pourin up
What's going on man?
Tell 'em Brain! Heyyy!

[Chorus: Brain]
It's a brainstorm
It's a brainstorm
Time to think of some ideas (think, think, think)
It's a brainstorm
It's a brainstorm
Everybody know the drill (we gotta think)
Oh it's a brainstorm
It's a brainstorm
Time to get my ass in gear

[Verse 1: Lil Dicky and Brain]
Brain don't even know
But the Brain don't even know
But the Brain don't even know
What the fuck is happening?
Brain so overanalyzed
Scrutinizing every single move
So weird
The Brain had no further questions Your Honor (I object)
Well I can testify

[Chorus: Brain]
It was a brainstorm
It's a brainstorm
Time to think of some ideas (think, think, think)
We in this
It's a brainstorm
It's a brainstorm
Everybody know the drill (think, think, think)
Oh it was a brainstorm
It's a brainstorm
Everybody know the drill
Woah Nelly It's a brainstorm
It's a brainstorm
Better bring your best ideas
Haaa

[Outro: Lil Dicky and Brain]
What the fuck was that?
Did you even come up with anything or no?
No, not yet, but the process is... underway now
So... any minute
I should be cookin' I should be whippin' it up
Alright, take your time
It's your process just let me know
I'm always down to help whip or whatever you need, so
I'll be, I'll be in the kitchen
Whatchu want, whatchu gonna make?
Nah, I'm actually just gonna clean the kitchen
Oh alright, bet
You say bet now?
Yeah
Alright, see you later, Brain
