[Verse 1]
Yeah fuck you think you dealin' wit
Every time ya hear da the kid you know he 'bout to kill dis shit
Every rhyme is sicker than an ugly bitch's period
You know the Jew is building something I ain't talking pyramids
Them bitches wit titties they wanna get up at the kid
They instant messaging Dicky, they wanna get up on his dick
But I ain't ready to hit it, because I'm relatively timid in the bed I admit it
But fuck that gay shit we should fuck soon
Baby whatchu wann do
Tell me when to come through
Take you out to Rita's then I'll skeet up where dat tongue blue
D could tweet a freak till I'm peekin' up at a cheek and that physique'll
Have me jackin' ma D if I don't agree to meet at her at her fucking condo
Eat it like a combo
Need it in the morning or I'm heated like Alonzo
You know that the geek about to mack up an actress
Imagining McAdams all on ma mattress
Attackin' ma sack and attractively crackin', ejaccin', we nappin'
The fuck you think you doin'
I'm rappin' some crack and I'm lackin' the practice cause the Jew
Dat's been smackin' the track up and snappin' has actually been doin'
This shit, renewing the spit, for one year
Fuck it though
Think you better read about ma fuckin' flow
I'm smoking weed wit clueless bitches cheatin' playin' suck-and-blow
Eatin' on some buffalo chicken fingers on a boat
Went from being honor roll to spreadin' like he on a roll
Haha...Whoa
Okay now I'm on a roll
Scoring got em screaming commentators speaking on a goal
Tourin' writing TV, getting greedy but I'm honorable
I swear dat Dicky isn't that conceited but I think it's time to

Roll another spliff, and we blowin' that
Salt and vinegar up in the whip, yea I'm holdin' that
Bitches droppin' back up in shotgun like they was Flacco or Rodgers
I'm doin' sixty so I tell em to stoppit, I need to concentrate
The hoes know D-I, been goin' mia
I'm in the four door Fiat, wit poquilla
Bitches das been showin' me interest
Seen up on Pinterest
Don't know how it happened but Lil Dicky back in business
