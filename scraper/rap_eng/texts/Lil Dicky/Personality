[Hook 1: Lil Dicky]
We ain’t ever been the motherfuckas
That could get a hundred-fifty bitches on deck
We the type of dudes that be putting in the effort
Just to show them that we better, get the broads like that
It’s how we do it!

[Ad-Lib: Lil Dicky]
Hey bitches
Uh, I know I can be a little bit much sometimes
But really I just do that shit for the fellas, you know
I rap for the fellas but like, this is for y'all

[Hook 2: Lil Dicky & T-Pain]
I ain't even strong like that
So average, I ain't tall like that
We just tryna show a little respect, maybe you'll go for it
I’m the one that you need and you just don't know it
We ain’t never been ballers
But we getting pussy with our personality
We getting pussy with our personality
We getting pussy with our personality

[Verse 1]
Honestly I’m like a seven with my hair long
Maybe seven and a half facial hair strong
But I make these bitches laugh and I care for them
I’m the type of motherfucker pulling out the chair for them
I ain’t ever been the G at the bar
That get them bitches hella wet just by seeing his arms
You know the boy about the leg work
I plant seeds, I’m a mexicano gardener
All I’m saying is I ain’t playing the game with these bitches, I ain’t mean to em
I prefer to show them everything that I can mean to them
Lil Dicky thrive with a friend of a friend
And I never hesitate to tell them that I love Rent
I am not a stud, I’m a boyfriend (yo)
I love love and I cuddle for enjoyment (I do)
My dick small but i’m telling you it’s nothing
By the time that we fucking they so emotionally interested
They really be cumming
Drinking champagne, oh you trying to dance babe
We can hit the floor I’m bout to show you how the man shake
We can make a handshake
Keep you safe and walk you to your damn place
Then I got you bouncing on my rubber like a trampoline
What you doing tomorrow? I’m with it
I’mma take you to the zoo and be cordial and witty
I’mma tell you hella stories and be mindful
Bet you get a little horny like the infant Rhinos

[Hook 2: Lil Dicky & T-Pain]

[Verse 2]
When I get your GChat, that’s a wrap hoe
Smoke weed, eat the pussy like a snack hoe
Dave lays you on top like a rap though
Bet you think I’m nice in person I ain’t talking rap shows
I ain’t gonna pick you up at the club
But if I get about an hour with you, bet you in love
I’ll ask questions
Oh you did your hair? Little Dicky pay attention
Oh you getting scared, what’s the root of all this tension?
You know I’d be a hell of a date and if you torn I will split the entrees that you crave
And when you bored I can send you Snapchats for days
And make them personally for you like they all will be based
Around the inside jokes we develop in time
And if you tired won’t initiate the sex it’s fine
I can talk you on the phone when you driving alone
And make you feel comfortable enough to take me to mom
And that bitch gon love it, she gon' tell your ass
'He legit yo hubby', she gone tell your ass need to quit your clubbin'
And go get that young'un while I’m sitting with your dad being slick straight grubbin'
I can take you out to brunch, call me hollandaise
Know exactly what you want every holiday
I can text you like a motherfucker, wordy and impressive
57 on the ketchup, hit you when you coming through

[Hook 2: Lil Dicky & T-Pain]

[Outro/Ad-Lib: Lil Dicky & T-Pain]
Whoo! Lil Dicky
Yes sir!
T-Pain. We gon' get them hoes some day man
I hope so
We're going places
Like together?
Not on a date but we're going places
Oh, okay
For instance I saw a nice looking young lady that I was attracted to sexually in the grocery part of Target
Sure
And I wanted to put my penis in her vagina
Okay
But I didn't tell her, and that my friends is the definition of a motherfuckin' gentleman
