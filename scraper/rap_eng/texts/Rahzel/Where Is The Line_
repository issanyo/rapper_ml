[Chorus]
Where is the line with you?
Where is the line with you?
Where is the line with you?
Where is the line with you?

[Verse 1]
My purse wide open
You ask again
I see you trying to
Cash into accounts everywhere

[Chorus]
Where is the line with you?
Where is the line with you?
Where is the line with you?
Where is the line with you?

[Verse 2]
I want to be flexible
I want to go out
Of my way for you
But enough is enough

[Chorus]
Where is the line with you?
Where is the line with you?
Where is the line with you?
Where is the line with you?

[Verse 3]
I am elastic
I want to go out
Of my way for you
I want to help you

[Chorus]
Where is the line with you?
Where is the line with you?
Where is the line with you?
Where is the line with you?

[Verse 4]
I want to have
Capacity for you
And be elastic, laa
To be elastic, elastic for you

[Chorus]
Where is the line with you?
Where is the line with you?
Where is the line with you?
Where is the line with you?

[Verse 5]
I'm elastic for you
But enough
Is enough

[Chorus]
Where is the line with you?
Where is the line with you?
Where is the line with you?
Where is the line with you?
