[Verse 1]
The nerves are sending shimmering signals
All through my fingers
The veins support
Blood that gushes impulsively towards

[Chorus]
Is the triumph of a heart
That gives all, that gives all
The triumph of a heart
That gives all, that gives all
The triumph of a heart
That gives all, that gives all
The triumph of a heart
That gives all, that gives all

[Verse 2]
The stubborn trunks of these legs of mine
Serve as pathways for my favourite fuel
Heading upwards towards my kidneys
(That celebrate)

[Chorus]
The triumph of a heart
That gives all, that gives all
The triumph of a heart
That gives all, that gives all

[Bridge]
Smooth soft red velvety lungs
Are pushing a network of oxygen joyfully
Through a nose, through a mouth
But all enjoys, which brings us to

[Chorus]
The triumph of a heart
That gives all, that gives all
The triumph of a heart
That gives all, that gives all
The triumph of a heart
That gives all, that gives all
The triumph of a heart
That gives all, that gives all
