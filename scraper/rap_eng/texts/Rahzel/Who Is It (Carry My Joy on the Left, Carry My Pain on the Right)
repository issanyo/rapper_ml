[Verse 1]
His embrace, a fortress
It fuels me and places
A skeleton of trust
Right beneath us
Bone by bone
Stone by stone

[Pre-Chorus]
If you ask yourself patiently and carefully:
Who is it? Who is it?

[Chorus]
Who is it that never lets you down?
Who is it that gave you back your crown?
And the ornaments are going around
Now they're handing it over
Handing it over, handing it over
Who is it that never lets you down?
Who is it that gave you back your crown?
And the ornaments are going around
Now they're handing it over
Handing it over, handing it over

[Post-Chorus]
Handing it over...

[Verse 2]
He demands a closeness
We all have earned a lightness
Carry my joy on the left
Carry my pain on the right

[Pre-Chorus 2]
If you ask yourself now, patiently and carefully:

[Chorus]
Who is it that never lets you down?
Who is it that gave you back your crown?
And the ornaments are going around
Now they're handing it over
Handing it over, handing it over
Who is it that never lets you down?
Who is it that gave you back your crown?
And the ornaments are going around
Now they're handing it over
Handing it over, handing it over

[Post-Chorus]
Handing it over...
