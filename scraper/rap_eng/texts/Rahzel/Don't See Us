[Intro: Black Thought]
Uh, what what, yo yo P-5-D uncut
Check it out, yo yo, S-P uncut
Yo yo, what P-5-D uncut, yeah yeah it's that Philly shit
Yo yo, check it out, yo yo

[Hook x2: Malik B]
You Don't See Us, but we see you
You stuck on sleep, get on your P's and Q's
Cause you will get crept, wit no discrept
You know the rep, we keep the flows in check

[Verse 1: Black Thought]
Mesmerizing, state of the art caffeine
It's over head like Omniverse screen
I'm not the average savage that curse queens
I'm something from his worst dreams
First we handling first things, I'm subsurface unseen
Grat'll hold planet by purse strings
MC's are earthlings, not built to hurt things
Speaking the words of weaklings, nothing but sweet things

[Verse 2: Malik B]
Man each world, it ain't no time to recline
Act up, get clapped up, my mind is the nine
Shine like jewels that spark, swimming with sharks
Never caught speaking to NARC's, that's weak in the parks
I'm the type to sit back and analyze the prize
Grip it up and flee the scene wit a different disguise
Take a detour, I be all that I can be whore
Talking to this *bitch* life, had to make her my wife
Live twice, got seven more lives to live
I'm all out, taking things to the fullest extent
Help me get it down and we can split one-hundred percent
Run a rapper through a maze like an experiment
Word up, you know the legendary Roots crew, yo

[Hook x2: Malik B]
You Don't See Us, but we see you
You stuck on sleep, get on your P's and Q's
Cause you will get crept, wit no discrept
You know the rep, we keep the flows in check

[Verse 3: Dice Raw]
The Raw Dice rise like a creature from out the swamp
With my blood-thirsty clergy that's on the hunt for conk
Who pumps your heart, I made you wanna rhyme from the start
You should be more alert, then you wouldn't get hurt
Get off your horse and on your P's and beware
Of images you seeing, did deceiving, you're scared
And even more shook up than the scenes that's near, I'm Dice Raw
Sting the inside of your mouth like a cold sore
Who wanna piece, well it's Round One, let's begin
I got a gun that's don't bust, it just suck niggas in
I got shit that'll have you begging me to shoot ya
I'm the professor, you rock a dunce cap, go get a tutor

[Verse 4: Black Thought]
Yo, Okay Computer, Radiohead's knock to the
Future Shock like Curtis, at your service
None other than, the Fifth governing playin the cut again
Y'all clueless to what the fuck is up again
Yo, hard times and sufferin
What, my peoples in the crevices strugglin
'Nuff of them ?untie? soldier thespian
But I'm from the next e-on, supreme being that's unseen for emceeing

[Hook x2: Malik B]
You Don't See Us, but we see you
You stuck on sleep, get on your P's and Q's
Cause you will get crept, wit no discrept
You know the rep, we keep the flows in check

[Verse 5: Malik B]
Yo, they all around me 'round me
On my head, they got a bounty
I'm trying to get this bail up, so I can flee your county
Triple-six, come in my mix, flood it with tricks
I'm sharper than rough spoons for icepicks
Niggas price bricks till dawn, if the money is long
Cats who play strong will inhale, then go play bong
You wrong son, you thought I wasn't dropping a ton
Sit and think about the way I wanna tally a sum

[Verse 6: Dice Raw]
Aiyyo I sneakfully snuck up from behind and got you
From over there in them bushes, I chilled and watched you
Dancin all dolly as you pussy for them folly
I knock you out wit one punch from me you been Ali-ed
I float like hovercrafts and sting like vaccinations
When my name said out loud, you'll lose your concentration
Dice Raw, D-I-C-E-R-A-W
You wanna take it, otherwise, fuck you gon' do?
That's what I thought, nada, nothing, caput, zero
Rough as sandpaper but still smooth as a tiptoe
Raw's taking over, baby don't tell me you ain't know
A lot of kids can rap but you fucking with the pros

[Bridge: Black Thought]
Know what I'm sayin', y'all know the legendary Roots crew, it's like

[Hook x2: Malik B]
You Don't See Us, but we see you
You stuck on sleep, get on your P's and Q's
Cause you will get crept, wit no discrept
You know the rep, we keep the flows in check
