[Intro:]

DJ
JS-1
Uh
Yeah
Sound good
Hip Hop all day uh
Yeah
Headrollers uh
Yeah
Here we go uh

[Verse 1:][Erick Sermon]
Yeah
Mr. Hard Core is back
DJ JS-1
He provided the track
That I'm about to attack
There up in the woods
Kinda big and black
Win airs in the hood
Actually nigga i’m good
I do it so easy
Tyrese
I’m a beast from the east
Grrr
At least I bring off the peace
I sign from the underground
Whenever I release
But you on the other hand
Need to be shot
For the man rule
Let’s spin a barrel
Pop
Droooooop
This year will be the best ya’ll seen
Make room
Coming through
Like a SUV
H-I-P
H-O-P
It's gonna be hard to S-T-O-P
Stop the band of the year
I’m on the ramp
And access is granted
So I'm taking the advantage
Damn it

[Chorus:]
Yeah
This is how we doing here
No fear
Saying make sure its clear
Any problem?
Solve it
But the answer
We ain't the one to be fucked with
(Hardcore, hardcore)
[repeat x1]

[Verse 2:][Buckshot]
Too many rap DJs
Coming for his crown
Went and got Buckshot
So they better duck down
I’m runnin up with the E Double
With double Glock
The two shotty, the 12 gauge
The double pop (pop)
JS in the Trailblaze
So pop the trunk
Too many bodies at the party
So it betta buck
Maybe a Halle or a Holly
21 Jump
21 guns salute
Suit up
(buzzing sound)
A quiet storm
Call it Viacom
Arm, arm
Make a nigga head transform
Selassie, Aasheim, Rackmon
Or are you Akbar
Dot com
I stay calm with that napalm
Too many gems in them pages
When I read Psalms
I’m the Holy Qu’ran
Teflon
This is not Ricki Lake
Or a Drake song

[Chorus]

[Verse 3:][Rahzel]
War is war
But you a backwards nigga
So when you see me
You see Thor
Bwoy
Your whole style is chump
Buckwild
I don’t smile
I dunk
Shots at you
You can tell
When you see your peeps
Ducking and hiding
The only place to duck is down
That’s if I sign em
Remind him
He got memory loss
Came out and set every course
I set it in course
Listen
This is only a fact
Me and [?] put Brooklyn on the map
You doubt that?
Son just Google it
Don’t get soup dude
Cause I’ll shoot up your oodles and noodles
And show dudes who’s in charge
Me and my squad
Listen dog don't pee in my yard
I know the smell
For heavens sake
Got to hell
JS 1 you spray this gun
And Buckshots swell

[Chorus]

[Verse 4:]
Big plans
Burning in the big hand
What I did to fam
Makes no sense
Had niggas ready to murder
When I paid those fans
Automatics and 9 mills
Made them tense
On the road
Like DMV
On the track with the E
From EPMD
Heads see
(that’s right)
So if you test me
You fail on the track
With Erick Sermon and As Rahzel
