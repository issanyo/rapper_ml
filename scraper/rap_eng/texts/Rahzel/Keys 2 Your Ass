I know you're ready to rock
'Cause I'm ready to roll
Let's go

Rock, roll
Ride, roll

If you wanna ride, if you wanna roll
You don't need the keys to the front door
Turn on the ignition, now I got you wishin'
We was in the back seat, we was gettin' nasty

If you wanna ride, if you wanna roll
You don't need the keys to the front door
Turn on the ignition, now I got you wishin'
We was in the back seat, we was gettin' nasty

I'll leave them under the back door
Or you can got through the side door if you want more
You know it's always open for you

(I got the keys to your ass) I got the keys to your ass
(I got the keys to your ass) I got the keys to your ass
(I got the keys to your ass) I got the keys to your ass
(I got the keys to your ass) I know how to pop that trunk
(I got the keys to your ass) I got the keys to your ass
(I got the keys to your ass) I got the keys to your ass
(I got the keys to your ass) I got the keys to your ass
I know how to pop that trunk

This ain't no broke back
I know how to throw back
Tryin' to make a comeback
Ain't no way to go back
Show you that ass crack
Eat it like a Big Mac
Show me what you got, black
Time to make it hot, black
If you got the keys
You can take it for a test drive
You know how to pop that
Make it bounce, make it live
Rollin' up a side street
Naked in the back seat
You ain't gotta pick this
Lock if you nasty

We was in the back seat, we was gettin' nasty
We was in the back seat, we was gettin' nasty
We was in the back seat, we was gettin' nasty
We was in the back seat, we was gettin' nasty
We was in the back seat, we was gettin' nasty

(I got the keys to your ass) I got the keys to your ass
(I got the keys to your ass) I got the keys to your ass
(I got the keys to your ass) I got the keys to your ass
(I got the keys to your ass) I know how to pop that trunk
(I got the keys to your ass) I got the keys to your ass
(I got the keys to your ass) I got the keys to your ass
(I got the keys to your ass) I got the keys to your ass
I know how to pop that trunk

Ride, roll
Ride, if you wanna roll
If you wanna ride, if you wanna roll
You don't need the keys to the front door
Turn on the ignition, now I got you wishin'
We was in the back seat, we was gettin' nasty
If you wanna ride, if you wanna roll
You don't need the keys to the front door
Turn on the ignition, now I got you wishin'
We was in the back seat, we was gettin' nasty

I'll leave them under the back door
Or you can got through the side door if you want more
You know it's always open for you
I'll leave them under the back door
Or you can got through the side door if you want more
You know it's always open for you
I'll leave them under the back door
Or you can got through the side door if you want more
You know it's always open for you
I'll leave them under the back door
Or you can got through the side door if you want more
You know it's always open for you
