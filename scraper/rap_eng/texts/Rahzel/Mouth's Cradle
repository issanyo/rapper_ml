[Verse]
There is yet another one
That follows me
Where ever I go
And supports me
This tooth is warmth-like
And these teeth are a ladder up to his mouth
These teeth are a ladder that I walk
That you can walk too if you want
If you want up to the mouth
The mouth's cradle
Up to the mouth's cradle
He always has a hope for me
Always sees me when nothing else
And everyone have left
That ghost is brighter than anyone
And fulfills me with hope

[Chorus]
And you can use these teeth as a ladder
Up to the mouth's cradle, the mouth's cradle
And you can follow these notes I'm singing
Up to the mouth's cradle, the mouth's cradle
The simplicity of the ghost-like beast
The purity of what it wants and where it goes

[Bridge]
Always love, always loves you, always loves you
Infrared love

[Chorus]
And you can use these teeth as a ladder
Up to the mouth's cradle, the mouth's cradle
And you can use these teeth follow my voice
Tooth by tooth
Up to the mouth's cradle, the mouth's cradle

[Outro]
I need a shelter to build an altar away
From all osamas and bushes
