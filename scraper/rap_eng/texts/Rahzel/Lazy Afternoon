(Everybody, wake up!)

[Hook x4]
It's a lazy afternoon
(Summertime, as I recline, lay back and relax, let the sun shine)

[Verse 1: Black Thought]
Consider this a message to my mellow in the front seat
Of the Jeep, pumpin' beats for your rump
In the summertime, I'm risin' to the shine at 12:20
Ghetto streets are sunny, niggas is gettin' money
It's mad hot, and what I got to do, I'm not sure of
I call up Maura, this dip I know from Bora Bora
Was rappin' for a second about what I reckoned that I
Was doin' at six, she was invitin' me to the flicks
That I'm with, blew a kiss, click, now I'm in the shower
I meant the bath in which I simmer for half an hour
Then got drier, put on attire to inspire
Hit my dresser for numbers of women that I admire
Laid around and lounged 'til around two
Then I got up and ate, drank a brew
And caught a page from the crew
Sayin', "Where ya at? Later, meet us up at the Plat
Bring a sack, ayo, it's Saturday, it's gonna be fat"
Now, it's 3:37 and I still ain't left the rest
Electric Relaxation from A Tribe Called Quest
With the boom, tokin', smokin', coolin' out as I parlay in my room
'Cause it's a lazy afternoon

[Hook x4]
