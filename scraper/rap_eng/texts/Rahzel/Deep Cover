[Verse 1]
Now, creep with me, as we roll with the undisputed heavyweight
Of beatboxing, as he drops the hotness
Constantly, with the frenzy of a mosh pit
Clock, But you don’t have to order pay-per-view to watch this
Astonishingly polished solid sonic concoction
Hear it... But still probably wouldn’t believe it with your optics
Shopping? Might as well go for the best, there are no options
Locksmiths couldn’t get you open like this Rahz kid
Qualified professionalism, that’s far from a bar trick
Drops that’ll fuck up your hearing, As much as arsenic is toxic
Shots against Tonedeff & Rahzel are harmfully thoughtless
And you’re unconsciousness is as far as your fucking plots get
QN5, We don’t just son you, you get adopted
JS-1 proves you’re only scratching was due to jock itch
You can ask your girl she know exactly where the cock’s been
And it isn’t the 1st time she’s been caught getting her twat dicked
Countless rounds spit, wanna counter my sound and pop lip?
Say bon voyage, use your head to christen a yacht ship
Leave you topless! I ain’t talk no fucking bra-shit
Just a boss-less hitman, crossing you off my job-list
Phenomenal conquests legendary as Loch Ness
Innocuous? Not if you ain’t gotten your plague shot yet
I’m hostile when I’m out for this house rent
So, please put your money where your mouth is, bouts with Rahz are a lost bet
You counterfeit hounds are countless
So, pay homage to the man, and put his style back exactly where you found it
