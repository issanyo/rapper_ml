[Intro: Malik B]
Check it out, one, two
M-illi-tant, I be the alias Malik B
Internationale rationale
All the people up to 68th Ave and across Broad Street
West Oak Lane, South Philly and North, et cetera
Check it out, check it out

[Hook]
Here on this agenda, there is no pretenders
So, when we begin to assassinate your cast members
Here on this agenda, there is no pretenders
So, when we begin to assassinate your cast members

[Verse 1: Malik B]
Dig it, cool, calm, collect in my perspective
Search the premises, I leave no clues for detectives
My verbal impact across your back, slap!
You talk about you see me, but your vision's full of cataract
It don't matter that, your glass house, I shatter that
Bad luck I walk under, now show me where the ladder at
Fill up the urinal organs up in your bladder, cat
Approachin' you with shriller rhetoric, as if you had a sack
Now, crews down Board - your gas pedal floored
With ammo and artillery and stash spot's the cheeba store
I use the banner of Islam for the sword
Change your strategic plan, my man's gettin' bored
Your vocal chord is fraudulent, and not the true porcelain
I bring the fire, earth and the source of wind
The force of sin will endorse the pen
We all search for sanity, but I think that it was lost again
Now, which stick-up artist can be the smartest?
My beam of sunlight shines the brightest and the farthest
Regardless of this bitch life because I pimp her
Control the temper, makin' MC's whimper
I tilt the Earth from off the axis in the center
Next, I'm in the womb like a placenta
M-Illitant the city ninja, uplift 'cause I'm the soul avenger Remember, I'm No Great Pretender

[Hook x2]

[Verse 2: Malik B]
Strategist, I bet y'all niggas can't believe this
I read you like a whole avenue that's filled with meters
Punks, fuck your back-talk, I watch how niggas cat-walk
Over my pit of venom and send 'em to the asphalt
For inquisitives who wanna try to test me
What protects me, will make you shake like epilepsy
Plague your neighborhood with lyrical le-prosy
Stimulate more than ecstasy, y'all niggas check my recipe
Dig it, I'm most observant, analyze when I'm chillin'
Peep out who's the villain then make your whole pavilion
Of a Sicilian, excuse the greed, don't want a mill', I want a zillion
Stacks of Franklins to the ceilin'
I counts stacks imported, fuck the yacht and the mansion
I want Pluto and Jupiter, political, universal expansion
Buy out Tommy and Helly Hanson
Kidnap America, 'Riq, you hold it for ransom
Pass it down to my grandson, I got no time to be romancin'
Only times for mental food and advancement
This game of life is strictly chancin', get to know the nature
Before I get to know the nigga while I'm glancin'
Enhancin' is my mental, I play in the midst
Of squads and peeps, most crews is not in the halfs of rentals
My utensils display a whole variety
Even when in the cut, niggas can't cut they anxiety
Peep, I fill your brain with suspicion
Pay attention like you paid tuition
And stop all your bull-ishin'
The rap chemist in the lab to the finish
The mic is my apprentice 'cause I can't stand courts or tennis
My pigmentation is the menace
That's why the system's always tryin' to pursue with a blemish
Pale asses think a nigga in this
My flow's tremendous, for the meal you can't replenish
The question you ask, will situations get worse?
Fam, I won't befriend ya 'cause I'm No Great Pretender

[Hook x2]

[Outro]
It's like that, one time for your mind
Fifth Dynasty, intertwine and combine
M-Illitant, the Bad Lieuten-ant
One hundred X, Bahamadia
Minds and souls, it's like that
Fifth Dynast', my man {?}, P.R. Star
My man Slick Looka
Check it out, one time like that
Feel the Fifth, One-Fifth attack
Your backbone and spine
Check it out
Brother Q.U.E.S.T
