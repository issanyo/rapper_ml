[Chorus - Rahzel the Legend]

It's a murder soundtrack. (soundtrack, soundtrack....)
It's a murder soundtrack. (soundtrack, soundtrack....)
It's a murder soundtrack. (soundtrack, soundtrack....)
Murder (Murder, murder, murder)


[A-F-R-O The Kid]

The aggravator exacerbated immaculator
And the mac he sprayed was mad layered a track slayer
Sadat was on guard, with armour and bombs ready
We stomped upon Freddie, and locked his arms steady

Pull the cord placement, the rapper had a choice
Grab the cash, stay mad hungry, lungin' at the boy
Shunned the son after annoyment
The wondered rappers enjoyment
The boy had lacked what his dad
And his grandmamma his told him

Grew up with the long shot, dark spotted hockey mask
Shot off a Glock, mossberg, and a cocky stance
Knockin' on doors. Popped the wrong person, then he bounced
Penny bounced on him
The boy's little sister

Employed with the scripture, or a ultimate gun-bust
Swarming, formin' his data that 'Fro was mostly an honor
To meet Sadat and then knock off mobsters in the town
Record a Murder Soundtrack in Will Tell's basement


[Chorus - Rahzel the Legend]

It's a murder soundtrack. (soundtrack, soundtrack...)
Repeat x7

(I started it, now I'm gonna end it...)



[Sadat X]

The bone rattling, gun-gattling crisis. Fuck ISIS
Robbery and heists(-es)
I'm right here where the dice-is
Have you buried where the mice is
Listen my advice is:

Afro to short hair
We take sport here
Don't get caught here
Beat Ill
Tell Will
Will Tell
We'll kill

Break bread, fake dead, take lead, club med, rap head, scrap's dead
Start again
Low cardigan
Tell me what's your part again
I finally found the art again
You finally found your heart again

Fuck that, we all is in
With Afro's spray
The young boy know all this, how he get that way?
Why my hair turn grey?
Burn your tax pay
A chef like Bobby Flay
They say "Daddy, you cray."



[Chorus - Rahzel the Legend]

It's a murder soundtrack. (soundtrack, soundtrack...)
Repeat x7
