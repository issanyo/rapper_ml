[Verse 1]
The pleasure is all mine
To get to be the generous one
Is the strongest stance
The pleasure is all mine
To finally let go
And evenly
We flow

[Chorus]
Who gives most
Who gives most
Who gives most

[Verse 2]
The pleasure is all mine
Women like us
We strengthen most
Host-like
When in doubt give

[Chorus]
When in doubt give
When in doubt give
