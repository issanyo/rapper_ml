[Verse 1]
I woke up in a warehouse
But the label had fell off
Just minding my own meltdown
It was there I heard the cannibals, cannibals
They said, "Hey, kid"
You got something special
(But it's now or never)
You wanna live forever
(But it's now or never)
You know you wanna give it to us
(But it's now or never)
But theres no pressure (baby)

[Chorus]
And I keep picking petals
I'm afraid they don’t love me anymore
‘Cause a kid on the ‘gram in a Black Dahlia tank
Says it ain’t heavy metal
(And that's alright, that's alright)

[Verse 2]
I try to do a head count
But I cannot find the (?)
Said they'd like to (?)
Then they gut me like an animal, animal
They said "You had that something special"
(But it's now or never)
Let's keep it quintessential
(It's now or never)
You know what we want, why not give it to us?
(It's now or never)
But there's no pressure

[Chorus]
So I keep picking petals
I'm afraid they don’t love me anymore
‘Cause a kid on the ‘gram in a Black Dahlia tank
Says it ain’t heavy metal
So I keep picking petals
I'm afraid they don’t love me anymore
‘Cause some kid on the ‘gram said he used to be a fan
But this shit ain’t heavy metal

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Chorus]
So I keep picking petals
All I wanna know do you love me anymore
‘Cause some kid on the ‘gram said he used to be a fan
But this shit ain’t heavy metal
(And that's alright)
And I keep picking petals
I'm afraid they don’t love me anymore
‘Cause a kid on the ‘gram in a Black Dahlia tank
Says it ain’t heavy metal
And I keep picking petals
I'm afraid they don’t love me anymore
‘Cause some kid on the ‘gram said he used to be a fan
But this shit ain’t heavy metal

[Outro]
No, this ain’t heavy metal
No, this ain’t heavy metal
