Back in the day when I started this
I never thought of all this, that I’d have all this
I came so far, got a little more to go
To live these dreams for my soul to grow
(X2)

[Verse 1: Stat Quo]
This is the dream, came up but still I grind
So far to go, hurdles I climb in my mind
These lines that I write, describe my fight
My prime objective is to transform my life
When shit got dark I took steps towards the light
Personal plights, live as a gamble we roll the dice
It’s a game we win, take baths in sin
Chin covered in bruises, now who’s the losers
Work hard, play hard, that’s how we maneuver
In the jungles with the vultures, snakes, and barracudas
No wonder we tote choppers and rougers
Trying to ball hog, enemies want to out hoop ya
It fucks with you when your friends become shooters
Aiming at your back, wanna see you laying flat
I keep my eyes on the prize, words on the track
Ain’t nothing in this world gon’ stop young Stat
Believe that!

[Verse 2: Asoka]
I’ve been doing it on my own, I was up in Rolling Stone
Trying to build a happy home and provide for my own
Working on the road, all alone, feeling lonely
Praying to a God, wondering if he’s even knowing me
For years, everyday, I thought how to make it out
Some people made it tough, I never thought they would doubt
And haters suck hard, man they still hating now
All I ever wanted was to make you all proud
Now I got the plate and everyone wanna taste
And I contemplate should I let the hate erase
Or should I make ‘em pay, and make these haters race
Cause back in the day the same laughed at my face
Irony, now all these girls got their eye on me
Desire me, wanna take me to their bed and lie on me
Lie to me, whisper in my ear oh so quietly
But honestly, it’s ain’t me, it’s the fame that they dying to see
