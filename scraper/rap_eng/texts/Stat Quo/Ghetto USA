[Intro: Stat Quo]
YEA! Uh, uh, uh
Uh, uh, uh uh uh uh
Sing the song now, uh, YEA!
Ha, all my niggas in the muh'fuckin struggle
Uh, uh, let me talk to you

[Stat Quo]
We from the ghetto, born in the bullshit
Preacher in the pulpit, granny need a lil' fix
Blood pressure high, work a job, no benefit
Whip repo'd, now it's back to the dealership
Tryin to play the game, gettin played like instruments
On the fence in my defense, make a mile out an inch
Momma said the devil in my soul, I should repent
My dawg lost his daughter, say he ain't seen God since
Said "Look bruh, listen bruh, ya ain't makin sense"
He replied "You right," pockets full of lint
Willie Lynch hung shit, hint hint
The root of all evil, now I know what they meant
To my dawgs in Flint hustlin to pay they rent
Thomasville Heights all night in a trench
Fuckin with the junkies or 9-to-5 on a bench
Clockin in, clockin out, like "Where time went?"
Damn, YEA!

[Hook: Antonio McLendon]
I come up hard, hard baby
But what don't kill you makes you stronger
But I come too far, far baby
To watch tears drop from yo' hunger
As long as we keep on grindin, keep on tryin
Wishing's not enough
To change our situation, time is wastin
We got to come up

[Stat Quo]
Uhh, ghetto USA...
I keep tryin to get ahead, but the fact still remain
Every dime I make it take half of my change
Ain't nuttin change, same fight, same ring
But it ain't pay-per-view, it's a survival thing
Some slang green pills, crank and 'caine
Some bitches strip and gold-dig and whore to maintain
My aunt just lost her job, here this shit go again
Couldn't pay her bills, she put a bullet in her brain
Her chil'en in the same house livin with the stains
On the wall, can't afford to move, what a shame
Shit done drove my uncle insane
He talkin to himself thinkin he the one to blame
Got seduced by the boy, shootin trouble in his veins
Wanted the pleasure, became a slave to the pain
Livin in the streets, died drowned by the rain
His life down in twos{?}, his blood flowin through the drains
Damn, YEA!

[Hook] w/ ad libs

[Outro: Stat Quo]
Now or never
Now, and forever
Yeah, every nigga in the struggle!
OH! YEA!
