[** feat. Marsha Ambrosius:]
This is the future in the present*
Only the best gifts should be expected
Or accepted by the masses
We toast with kool aid in our glasses
With some vodka of course
Smoking that whoopi Goldberg
With my dog jayfer
He said stat take the game like it ain't yours
And beat the track up like [? ]
I mean purple and what matters is family
And I'm urkel vision is uncanny
Real name Stanley raised next to annie
It's a hard knock life I was hoping to my granny
Nieces nephews cousins neighbours
Big momma told me I was born to get paper
Looking out the window surrounded by sky scrapers
Head in the air feeling like I made it
Switched labels you can say I've been traded
Aftermath politics I guess I've been shady
And I can't give a fuck if you hate it
But the streets lovin niggas
I'm related to the pavement
Stat quo I'm home
Every body just raise your glass (get to toastin somethin homie so welcome me back)
Welcome back welcome back (and now they welcome me back)
Everybody could you welcome me back (and ya'll can welcome me back)
Ooh (some say I was gone but I've been at home writing my rights and wrongs in song for ya'll martian)
Now I'm home now I'm home (and you can welcome me home)
Everybody would you welcome me home (welcome me home yeah)
I'm at home cause it lives in me
So Therefore I am an extension of thee
I gave back we all branch from the same tree
Eating off the same [? ]
What's ya name boy kin ta s-t-a-t
Id give up a billion if I had it
Just to let my folks free
Shout out to vick
Shout out to t.I.p
Real niggas but these cracks call them convicts
Black as fuck on my akon shit
Ridin trough the city on my twitter
Follow me bitch
Wish every hood nigga could get rich
And all their kids can go to Harvard
I guess I'm dreamin with my eyes open
Heartless like the 808
The whole worlds heart broken
And as long as the globes in motion
I'm a be floatin like the water in the ocean
I'm home
Every body just raise your glass (get to toastin somethin homie so welcome me back)
Welcome back welcome back (and now they welcome me back)
Everybody could you welcome me back (and ya'll can welcome me back)
Ooh (some say I was gone but I've been at home writing my rights and wrongs in song for ya'll)
Now I'm home now I'm home (and you can welcome me home)
Everybody would you welcome me home (welcome me home yeah)
I'm the road that arose out the concrete
Made something outta nothing if you ask me
I'm jim jonsin when the tyres and the track meets
[? ] ridin shotgun that's me in the backseat
With my fears in my rearview fuck sleep
Mind body soul voice and heart beat
I'm my people when I talk you hear the hood speak
They see themselves when they see me on the tv
When my money got funny I heard all they jokes
[? ] sense of humour lord knows I wasn't broke
Now I'm at aspen smoking kush on the slope
Middle fingr in the air
Damn right I'm home ho
Every body just raise your glass (get to toastin something homie so welcome me back)
Welcome back welcome back (and now they welcome me back)
Everybody could you welcome me back (and ya'll can welcome me back)
Ooh (some say I was gone but I've been at home writing my rights and wrongs in song for ya'll)
Now I'm home now I'm home (and you can welcome me home)
Everybody would you welcome me home (welcome me home yeah)
