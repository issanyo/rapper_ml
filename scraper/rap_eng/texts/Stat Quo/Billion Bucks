[Intro]
Hey, hey - Most certainly {"LT Moe music, music, music.."} Yeah!
Hey, hey - LT you a fool for this one!
Hey, hey - Statlanta, Statlanta..
Hey, hey - ha ha ha, I'm my favorite too

[Verse 1]
This is Zone 3 speakin, Stat Quo stay cheesin
On the grizz e'ry day, and night, and season
Out here, I ain't leavin, you hatin for no reason
Keep bitchin and tongue teasin, them heaters'll start squeezin
Have you sick and grievin, dead not breathin
Get back, lay down motherfucker now, we even
Primetime G'in, him ya ain't seein
Mad cause I fucked yo' bitch, she suck my dick like she was eatin
The children's in my region, the city really needs him
Cause these niggas rappin, slackin and underachievin
Check my brain, know the name, the status I'm reachin
Ice you never dream of, while ya all are sleepin
Bad girl freakin, all night skeetin
Huh, pimp hard, leave the country for the weekend
No question, I'm him all season
Statlanta, oh yes, the one you should believe in

[Hook]
Hey, they say I'm doin too much
I don't twist in my whip, blowin purp out the dutch (out the dutch)
No, shawty pop that clutch
Finger up, other hand on my nuts, shawty WHAT?
(I'm fresh, dressed, like a billion bucks)
Hey (I'm fresh, dressed, like a bil-I'm-I'm)
(I'm-I'm fresh, dressed, like a billion bucks)
Hey (I'm-I'm fresh, dressed, like a billion bucks)

[Verse 2]
Is he the street-est of the stret niggas? (Nope!) I ain't tryna be that
I'm just tryna get scrilla my nigga, shawty relax
Folk off in the barbershop, askin where I be at (where the nigga be at?)
Fuckin yo' bitch while you cuttin hair, nigga buy that
The {?} on my badge, GMM still intact
I don't snap when I dance, I just snap on this track (c'mon)
E'ry nigga tryin to trap on wax, ease back
Knock-kneed, I'm me, I won't slack but a scratch
I got love for my folk who really hustle for the snacks
I don't fire up a match, I know you wonder what I pack
Just know it's jet black, fully loaded, buddy act
I ain't tryin to be a gangsta but I will cock it back
To defend my folk, I'll be forced to react
On some violent shit, and push your wig straight back
It's Stat, dig that, I'm the shit, them the facts
You don't like me when you see me, keep it movin, bad back (AY!)

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
I rep the A from my fitted on down to my feet
E'ry time I hit the club I'm goin home with a freak
Lames hate me from the side cause I'm who they wanna be
Bad bitches in my ride cause they all know that I'm
{"I'm fresh, dressed, like a billion bucks"}
Hey {"I'm fresh, dressed, like a bil-I'm-I'm"}
Hey {"I'm-I'm fresh, dressed, like a billion bucks"}
Hey {"I'm-I'm fresh, dressed, like a billion bucks"}
