[Intro/Chorus One: Stat Quo]
Oh ohh oh ohhhhhhhh!

[Kanye - talking over Chorus]
It's ya boy Kanye to The
The Roc is in the building right now
We smoked out
And I don't even talk like that

[Verse One: Kanye West]
Now if my man Benzino got a Benz and they call him Benzino
When I get my Bentley they gon call me Bent-lino
Lot of shit changed since I hooked with Jay-Z yo
For the tracks I done got 800 C-notes
So glad I ain't take the drive to Home Depot
Right now my car and home would be repo'd
Fuckin with my girl today around three-oh
My man said let's call some girls that we know
Ohhhhhhhh!  Sometimes I wanna say fuck my bitch
But I don't want nobody to fuck my bitch
Even if a modelin chick sucked my dick
It wouldn't make me now feel so sick, just because
They came over to cheer me up
Smoked, drink, and yeah we fucked
No matter what they do it can't be enough

[Chorus One]

[Chorus Two: Stat Quo]
I'ma smoke like I never smoked befohhh, 'fohhh
I need some girls that's really down to get lowww, lowwww

[Stat Quo - talking over Chorus Two]
Wooo!  Yeah!  Haha.. Stat Quo nigga
Shady motherfuckin Aftermath, you understand me?
Uhh

[Verse Two: Stat Quo]
Looka here homes gettin my stunt on
I step in the bar I'm a superstar
They know who I are from the pimp description
Mack hoes just to get 'em in the doggy position
Put my key in yo' ignition and work the kitten
Introduce you to how hustlers livin
Dick and bubblegum is all I'm givin
New whip, new year, new crib to sit in
I'll take ya bitch, make ya bitch make me rich
From major chips, but now you sick
How Stat Quo got dough to flow and dough to blow
'Gnac to sip and wigs to split
'Nuff grip won't slip, be easy
Your girlfriend wants to, please me
Make a porno, put her on TV
(Do a porno tape with that hoe mayne)
Make that pussy drip drip when she see me

[Chorus One] + [Chorus Two]

Mafia!
