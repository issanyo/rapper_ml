(Verse)
Fuck being humble, I used to work at MacDonald’s
Frying chicken at churches, serving my niggas combos
I had breakfast with Bono, private flights in Toronto
5 star suites in Milan, just the life of a don
Breaking Bad like Walter, yea now it’s stressin like Jesse
IRS on my ass, Uncle Sam tryin to get me
Oh Lawd, oh Lawd oh Lawd I need liberation
Smoking on chunky fine day and night, it feel like I’m bassin
You see you made that pressure eat you alive
For the sake of my son and mama I had to survive
Either rappin’ or trappin’
Had no time for relaxin’
This my mufuckin passion
I’m so sorry Miss Jackson
That I ain’t
Get a 9-5 after graduatin’ with my bachelors
I was born to make it happen
This in my genes, fuck slackin
Ain’t no thing but chicken wings, see I stay true
When you deep in the grind this how the real wasn’t through

(Pre-Hook)
In my old school Caddy with the East Point spokes
I’m a AT alien, real nigga broke

(Hook x3)
Yea I’m a OutKast (OutKast)
OutKast (OutKast)
OutKast
Yea yea yea yea

(Verse)
Smoking on stankonia in southern California
Zontre til the death of me, this money is my destiny
So fresh, so clean
Fresh out of Beverly… Hills
Born in the bank, yea I remain a G
MIA with my Haitians and why she smoking Jamaica?
Florida with them Mexicans, my white boys clean up that paper
Yea I suffered some losses, congreagated with bosses
Strippers trickin and flossin
Have a bank account in the coffin
Friends left me stranded, family took me for granted
Got stabbed in my back like Caesar, I ain’t panicked
Hold on, get strong my nigga
I was born for the pro my nigga
Even when I’m gone my nigga
My mind on home my nigga
Get up, get out
Ain’t no bread on the couch
Bullshit ain’t allowed, I gotta rep for the south
Devil putting holes in my boat
You chose to sink or float
I survive just to shine, all you lame niggas hope

(Pre-Hook)
In my old school Caddy with the East Point spokes
I’m a AT alien, real nigga broke

(Hook x3)
Yea I’m a OutKast (OutKast)
OutKast (OutKast)
OutKast
Yea yea yea yea

(Verse)
Speak about screamin, bumpin up below
On a 1 to 5, hit one or tee, they remind of the low
I got gasoline dreams, red velvet ambitions
Love them jazzy bells, bitch dunk yo ass
This is bouncing and it’s switching
Roll and climb the nerve, flim flam, yelli hoody who
My elevator’s going up now cuz yo boy’s sucka proof
See these haters gon hate
Cuz that’s what haters do
I’m celebratin now, I made this thing a truth

(Pre-Hook)
I’m in my old school Cadillac with the Compton spokes
I’m a AT alien, real nigga broke

(Hook)
Yea I’m a OutKast (OutKast)
