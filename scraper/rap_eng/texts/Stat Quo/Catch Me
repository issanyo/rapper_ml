Start at it*
I feel your pain I feel your plight
These bright lights blind me
I'm slippin up on this black ice black ice black ice ice
It's cold and it show you right
The city never sleep we stay up to pay the price
An if I fall And when I fall Who gon catch me
If I fall And when I fall who gon catch me
If I fall And when I fall who gon catch me
If I fall And when I fall who gon catch me
I am my mommas only child
Grannys favorite grandson
These streets I run (huh)
Like the reverend
No dmc only red dirt bredren
No good times raised next door to the heavens
Dreamin bout the jefferson they building In the heavens
The hood had be bent like sevens
Listening to devin on the walkman
Just doin some old shit
Talkin to my uncle he tellin me stories of old pimps
Ridin no tints windows down top dropped
Fantasizing bout what I'm about when I get to that gwop
Like it means something like it really means something
I need to stop wasting my time
Like I need another watch
Nah I need another pair of pots
To cook up a new hustle when my old one stop
I geuss I want what I don't have
When I should be happy with what I got
So I'm a get my mind right
1da let the beat rock
Stat quo
Nobody tells you what happens when you fall down
Who gon catch me who gon catch me
It's been a long time I've been so lost I can never be found
Who gon catch me who gon catch me
Nine toes out the other toe left in
In limbo tryna assemble my life again
It get turbulent on some fly shit
Tryna keep up an impress the bad bitches with the cnd cup
We at the strip club tonight my rent due in the morning
Now my money goin on my industry friends?
No more em no more dre
I guess he finito people
Left me out to dry but I spit more lethal
Came back on they ass I give a fuck n***a
And me and dre still cool
That's how real friends do
And I ain't got nothing to prove
To nobody but myself and god the rest I exclude
Staying true to me is all I'm tryna do
When bullshit occur out the blue
I keep my head in the clouds
To guide my way through
Until my lifes through
That's how ya boy gon do
Nobody tells you what happens when you fall down (nobody)
Who gon catch me (Who gon catch me)
Who gon catch me (Who)
It's been a long time I've been so lost I can never be found
Who gon catch me (Whos gonna catch me)
Who gon catch me (Who)
(Who hmm hmm)
(Whos gon catch me)
(Whos gon catch me)
