[Keri]
If you want me to can find me in A

[Snoop Dogg]
What you smoking on, let me get you loose
Have some Hennessey, mix it with this apple juice
See we can have a ball, that's where the heat play
I know the DJ and he gone let the beat play
I ain't forgot bout, you know I care bout you
I been thinkin bout you, tryin to get this drink up out you
Now if you buy me one, and then you buy me two
And now we doin shots, man I gots to have you

[Keri]
Chillin on the dance floor
He rolled up behind me
Feelin on my body
Oh I think he like me
He was lookin good
But he was drinkin lonely
He asked me what I'm drinkin you alerady know its

[Chorus]
Henny and apple juice (with ad libs) [x14]
Everybody look good in the club

[Keri]
Walkin by the bar I see this other man
I guess I gotta stop he t-tuggin on my hand
He was lookin good but he was on that goose nah
You can't get me loose less you got that juice
Its better when you on that juice
If you get me in the zone ill mess with you
When you look like this them boys wanna
You ain't even gotta ask whats in my cup
Cuz I'm on that

[Chorus]

[Keri]
It must be the strobe light
Got you lookin so right
Just step if you feel this
Just don't let me spill this
Had a couple chasin
I'm not really thinkin
You can take me home, but [?]
Everybody look better when you on that juice
If you get me in the zone ill mess with you
When you look like this them boys wanna
You ain't even gotta ask whats in my cup
Cuz I'm on that

[Chorus]

[Stat Quo]
First of all
I'm Stat you can find me in the club
Sippin apple juice and yak
These chicks wanna roll wit a mac
Shawty stay clean show the crease in my slack
Yes I keep my self on that one sip ain't no turnin back
All them girls look thicker of that liquor him just dont know how to act
Its obviouis I love that
She standin still but it feel like she breakin it down gettin loose
I'm tryin to get her to the crib so the stat can
I wonder if shes really fine or if its that drink in my cup
Nevermind after sippin...

[Chorus]
