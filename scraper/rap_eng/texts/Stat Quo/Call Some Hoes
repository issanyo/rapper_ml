The Roc is in the building right now

[Verse One: Kanye West]
Now if my man Benzino got a Benz and they call him Benzino
When I get my Bentley they gon call me Bent-lino
Lot of shit changed since I hooked with Jay-Z yo
For the tracks I done got 800 C-notes
So glad I ain't take the drive to Home Depot
Right now my car and home would be repo'd
Fuckin with my girl today around three-oh
My man said let's call some girls that we know
Ohhhhhhhh!
Sometimes I wanna say fuck my bitch
But I don't want nobody to fuck my bitch
Even if a modelin chick sucked my dick
It wouldn't make me now feel so sick, just because
They came over to cheer me up
Smoked, drink, and yeah we fucked
No matter what they do it can't be enough

Mack hoes just to get 'em in the doggy position
Put my key in yo ignition and work the kitten
Introduce you to how hustlers livin
Dick and bubblegum is all I'm givin
New whip, new year, new crib to sit in
I'll take ya bitch, make ya bitch make me rich
From major chips, but now you sick
How Stat Quo got dough to flow and 'dro to blow
Yak to sip and wigs to split
'Nuff grip won't slip, be easy
Your girlfriend wants to, please me

Yeah, yeah
You know what I told them cats?
Let me tell you what I told em

[Verse Three: Chamillionaire]
Go get a bigger scale
On a scale of one to six
I'm an 11, you're in heaven when I punish it
I got her naked but I know I wasn't gonna hit
She was lookin at it like that isn't gonna fit
I told her I was only gonna use half of it
If you want a smaller size go and rent a plastic dick
Why you actin like you a genital activist
Matter of fact you can get out, you can pack your shit
And she was like, "Ay, why you gotta act like this?"
Cus your wastin my time you can ask my wrist
Now you trying to talk to me about abstinance
She was like wait a second let me ask you this
Is you're name Chamillionaire, do you rap?
No
Ain't you on that song with Kanye West and Stat Quo?
Ron C says you was
Oh is that so?
And then I said if he did don't know what he told you that fo
