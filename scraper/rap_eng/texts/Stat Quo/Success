[Stat - over Hook]
Not nuttin (not nuttin)
YEAH!
Some people love money
That's cool {*laughs*}
So, some people love drugs, that's aight
Some people love these bitches
That's cool too, YEAH! (YEAH!)
Tell you what I'm in love with though

[Stat Quo]
I wake up with it, on my mind
Rain, sleet, whatever, I gots to get it
Got hip to the grind so I had to ribbit
Hopped in the game, Jimmy gave me a ticket (millionaire!)
Went to the streets to flip it
Gymnastic pimp, walk with a limp, I'mma father shadows (shadows)
And all my paths are narrow
Haters tried to drown me but the water was shallow (some say I was)
I stomp through the puddles (through the puddles)
Now I'm ballin like niggas in huddles
See, we live for the hustle
Plain train or grain, I'm the one they can't muffle (can't muffle)
Runnin in a race, sittin used to the struggle
They asked me what I'm doin, gettin money's my rebuttal
In this game people hate to love you
Me and success, we make a pretty fine couple
Stat Quo, YEA!

[Stat - over Hook]
Yeah! Success baby
IT'S ALL OVER ME!
YEAH! I love you success
You love me too? I figured that
You're so good to me!
AHHH! I'll never cheat on you baby!

[Stat Quo]
Cain't stop, won't stop, that's what Biggie said
Martin had dreams, 'Pac said he had nightmares
Do the shelltoes, dawg I'd rarely rock Nike Airs
Rollin up purple, blowin smoke in the night air
These niggas playin musical chairs
A lot of rappers losin they deals and ain't prepared
Some get spared but they unaware
That the white boys in the suits ain't playin fair
So I hide my motives, downplay my love
Playin chess in my mind to get my paper up (paper up)
Every drop is precious in a half-filled cup
One bottle, thirty niggas, only two drunk as fuck
And I'mma be one of the two (one of the two)
Ridin underneath the sunshine with you-know-who
I mean us, it's no rush
Me and success, the only bitch I trust
Stat Quo (Stat Quo)

[Stat - over Hook]
YEA YEA, YEA!
YEAH! YEAH! HA HA!
Not a motherfuckin THING!
Uh-uh-uhh, uh uh-uh-uh uh-uh-uhh
Success, 'til death do us part, right?
Yeah, AHHH... OHH!
