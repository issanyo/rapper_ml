[Verse 1: Game]
I wake up in the morning chilling with my feet up
Looking on my Instagram for pussy to beat up
Hey, Sap turn that beat up, hey nigga roll that weed up
Riding through the hood top down trowing that B up
Turn that YG up, cause niggas fed up
Niggas get murdered in my city not keeping their head up
I'm talking Bloods, Crips and shit
Bodies twisting like licorice
Watch when that pistol lit [Chik-Chik], niggas hit the fence
Cowards, ducking in them lead showers
Couple of niggas be snitching, pointing like Watts towers [Shshsh]
That's how niggas get locked up
40 Glocc tough? what?
That nigga got socked up
And he suing me for four point five
Let me see, move the decimal
Once to the right, that's a forty five
Glock at the light, now you a vegetable

[Bridge 1: Game]
Tell 'em niggas where I'm from ... you heard
Stat tell em niggas where I'm from
AR tell em niggas where I'm from ... Esco
Dre, tell em niggas where I'm from

[Bridge 2: Game]
The city of money, power and tears
Overdoses, nightmares, yeah
Can't walk around here keep talking around here guns spark around here
Yeah

[Verse 2: Stat Quo]
Atlanta nigga, my nigga raised round J’s, ran plays
Throwing up trey’s, my dogs squeeze triggers
Dreaming on what we be when we bigger
Firm Biz delivered
Haters shiver, they see us
Sedans filled with divas
Sniffing Justin Bieber
We staying in the game
You lames's in the bleachers
Luxury vehicles with all the latest features
The preachers can't reach us
Smoking kush on the beaches, no reception
It's a blessing ever since recession just progression
Bank account stretching, models in my section
As I stare at my reflection, boss nigga
These bitches love my complexion, they ain't just talk nigga
Huh
Crack in the pot let it bubble on the block
Watch it double so we can huddle and ball with the Roc
Got niggas from, Watson, S.W.A.T.’s and niggas from Harlem
But my niggas from Compton it's a problem
Firm Biz

[Bridge 1: Game]
(Stat Quo: Yeah) Tell 'em niggas where I'm from ... you heard
Stat tell em niggas where I'm from (Stat Quo: DT)
Hey ya'll tell em niggas where I'm from ... Esco
Drake, tell em niggas where I'm from

[Bridge 2: Game]
The city of money, power and tears
Overdoses, nightmares, yeah
Can't walk around here keep talking around here guns spark around here
Yeah

[Outro: Stat Quo]
I swear these niggas lame my nigga
You a iPhone 5c nigga
You understand that?
You the nigga that got the Turquoise back
Your pull that shit out, niggas'll slapping you off real
Straight molly-whopping you dog, you're not welcome
IPhone 5c ass nigga
You thought you was just gonna cut the corner and pay 99 to shine
We don't fuck with you nigga
Half price ass bitch ass soft ass lame ass nigga
You understand me?
Yeah
