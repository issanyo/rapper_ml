We in the streets playa get your mail
It's only 2 places you'll end up either dead or in jail
With no where to go, no where to go, no where to go
Still no where to go, no where to go,no where to go yeah
Now throw your hands up, hustlers, busters, boosters, hooo
Everybody, fuck that
With no where to go, no where to go, no where to go
Still no where to go, no where to go, no where to go

[Verse 1: Jon Connor]
Yeah look, 2 words fly city, my city
From where if you're not empty you'll be doing 2 words, die quickly
Represent from where the murder rate set precedent, depressing
Crime infested overlooked by the President
Population of minorities, only as free as we can afford to be so we don't make the list of priorities
Nigga, look at where we rest at, naw we don't rest, fact
Cuz it's real that my city, two words, death trap
I do it for the shot up houses, boarded buildings
Niggas order killings more than will and [?] sorry for the children witness dealings while they chillin'
Greasin' [?] on the stove, Momma left you in the morning and she still ain't made it home
Two words, Jon Connor, Don dotta
Niggas look hard but they sweet, niggas cherry hands gobstoppers
I was always taught stay the fuck out of the way
And mind your business before you a victim and your boy turn to the witness
Let's go

[Verse 2:Kap Kallous]
Two words, I am, one word, ozone, don't you, fuck with, two words, my home
I get, stressed out, no dough, get that
Two words, ski mask, duck down, get back
I been, too ill, too long, not to, two words, blow up
I will, not you, since we saying 2 words, I'ma flip em 2 birds
Fuck you, straight up, Kap Kallous, do work, two chicks, went raw
Get shit, got real, weed smoke, two hits, we on, E pills
Two pounds, broke up, B-I-G posters, everyday struggle, favorite song
But hold up, two words ain't enough for me to breakdown the type of shit I be on
Welcome to the mad house, got two doors, choose one, two words good look, look ma, no hands
I done, [?]

[Verse 3: Mickey Wallace]
I tell em 1 word, absurd, describe these guys, claiming they your mans
Shaking hands, I see through the lies
Two words, mother fucker, bandwagon hitch hugger
Stay the fuck from around suckas, everybody move
Three words, go get it, in a hurry, see the vision making money
Did I mention making money, pay attention
Four words, creeping when I came, fucking up the lane, nothing was the same for educating brains [?]
Five words, Momma was a god damn [?], [?] babies since the 80s, how many of y'all came up like new words to the wise
That's why I write with such a hell of a force
Holla get em when I recite and keep my hand on the pulse of the people
The proper procedure, move a paraplegic, it's a famine, I'm here to feed em
Give em something to believe in, screamin' fuck two tears in a bucket
Learn to stand on our own two, down to [?], stand up and riot
Now we taking what's due, now throw your hands up
