[Hook: Sean Brown]
I see them mad, but I'm riding like "fuck it"
This the real shit, what's ever purchased with your budget
So what you know about it, I thought you knew about it?
You got a problem, what the fuck you gonna do about it?
Think they need a warning, working while you snoring
That's why I shut it down in every city I perform in
So what you know about it, I thought you knew about it?
I'm going up, and there ain't nothing you could do about it, huh?

[Verse 1: Sean Brown]
I got a question for you niggas, what you thinking now?
You know I'm taking over, by the way, I'm Sean Brown
My buzz is going up like California gas prices
Flow is sicker than Illuminati sacrifices
I just do it, influenced by everything around me
Got a couple of Grammys on my mind, so nigga (?)
Used to ball like Kobe till I chose the pen
Killing niggas on the beat, now my life is full of sin
Walk in my Jays, you'd be quitting the first day
Try to shoot the J, you niggas be bricking like cocaine
Couldn't stand the pressure, you bust, then you getting messy
They could say whatever they want, I just take it as a blessing in disguise
My faith is high like the clouds in the sky
You wanna bring me down, now why would you try with this guy?
You hating on the fact that I'm down with Alumn I
Hardwork motherfucker, that's my alibi

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Jon Connor]
This is true talent, you say you hungry, then dude's famished
My punchlines make sure dudes vanish with a tooth damaged
Needing the D.D.S., they ain't never gonna see me stressed
I be eating these beats, let's see what the chef is gonna cook up next
Smell me, I make them overdose, they go wherever my odor floats
You niggas want to be ballers, while I sit where the owners toast
I spit to get the holy ghost, like I was spitting Jehova's quotes
You trying to go toe-to-toe, and don't know the ropes, now your nose is broke
You on the Titanic, you're trying to keep the boat afloat
My quotables exposed that you're an inmate that can't hold the soap
My mind is sharp like turning a hanger into a switchblade
My bars keep getting harder, you getting soft more like tenth grade
They had to hate the Freshman candidate that made it
By putting soul in his music like Donny Hathaway, had to say that
Two of you don't equal half of me, one of a kind
And there will never be another after me, cause this is my game

[Outro: Vocal Sample]
Since this is your game, we'll play it your way, my baby
