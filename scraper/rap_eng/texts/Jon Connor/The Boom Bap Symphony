Real MC on the mic, 1, 2
Real MC on the mic, 1, 2
Real MC on the mic, 1, 2
Real MC on the mic, fuck, you!

[Verse 1]
I tried to do it your way
Now its fuck the world, this the foreplay
Now they like give me more like a whore say
I’m coming for the championship
They know the game's won from game one
I’ve been fighting all my life watching fake niggas change like Shang Tsung
The flow’s stupid but he ain’t dumb
Head strong as 8 tons, defeat them so they can’t run
And the snakes tongue gets chopped off and doused with hot sauce
Spittin that venom at me, and I roll with niggas that’ll knock your mouth off if you mouth off
Take a pause for the cause
I got bars that’ll make your jaws hang down to your balls and make your team not wanna get involved
My run'll make them flashback to Biggy and Pun
It’s my job to give them fire that’s why they hired the sun
I guess that’s why they always said I had my head in the clouds
Married to the game as I recite my vows to the crowd
Be in the fight soaking wet still won’t throw in the towel
Is you a sheep or a wolf, now you hearing me howl, mother fucker

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
The game is lacking passion
That’s why when I hit the stage it’s an immediate reaction
They know it’s more than just rapping
They insecure when I spit, they ain’t sure of their manhood
It ain’t hype when I write, they right, I’m just that damn good
I write, I produce and spit the truth in the booth
So shit if I was you, I’d hate me too
Before your eyes I see 40 skies that said I wouldn’t blow up
It’s like I don’t get shit, and get your ass tore up
A show off, they hit model chicks with more hooks
No talk, strait to the tele, then beat it up like Nikita Koloff
They hating as if that matter
WWE when they see me, how these motherfuckers jack swagger
Try to ignore me but enough is enough, but I guess
Shit ain’t a problem till the toilet won’t flush
Smarten up with your dumbass
Hittin the G-spot how my money cum fast
Is it you or you confused nigga?
You can’t beat me cuz you spend more time thinking about me losing
Than you do you winning
Should be a crime to be so wise in these lines giving knowledge to the
Minds of those who try to plan my demise
They’ll probably have better luck if they just study my rhymes
Try to stop me, they can’t but I’m having fun watching them try
And to the niggas I contend with, this what I'mma end with
Can’t lose sleep over haters when I ain’t sleep to begin with
…gone…
