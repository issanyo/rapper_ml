[Hook 2x: Lia Mack]
My tea's gone cold, I'm wondering why I got outta bed at all
The morning rain clouds up my window and I can't see at all
And even if I could it'll all be gray but your picture on my wall
It reminds me, that it's not so bad, it's not so bad

[Verse 1: Jon Connor]
Dear Chris, I hope these words reach you
My only regret is that I never get to meet you
I used to scream the words to Juicy to my voice went horse
Now my mama smiles when she sees my face in The Source
I think to myself, is this what you envisioned?
And how different would the game be if you was still living
Fat, black, ugly as ever but we ain't give a shit
True lyricist and now we caught up in these images
In ignorance we act like we can't remember when you was on the radio
Killing shit, just spitting the realest shit
Between you and I sometimes all I do is cry
Cause you was the only one who was ready for you to die
And we say you was the greatest cause we know you spit your soul
And today you can't blow unless you doing what you're told
And I'm just letting you know how much your legacy meant to me
And just know that lyrically you will always live through me

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Jon Connor]
Yeah, dear Pac it's like I'm the only one fighting
One of the last who still give a shit about what he writing
I hate when people talk about you and all they got was Thugging
Cause 'keep ya head up' was what taught me how to treat a woman
And all the controversy is what folks like to remember
But my nigga had a sister, who had the same story as Brenda
And see you knew her pain that was the only thing what mattered
So why don't you go and ask her if 2Pac was just a rapper
But you, you had a message and we felt it
And you knew the story of the struggle and you wasn't scared to tell it
You said that if you don't change the world than your words will plant the seeds
You know 'bout where I'm from I got you and Breed on repeat
You showed me the sky's the limit from a rapper to an actor
From the background dancing to sharing a screen with Janet Jackson
You showed me as a writer that my job is to inspire
Always reach for the stars but you told me to reach higher, for real

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Jon Connor]
Dear Breed, I was only 20 when I met you
Nervous glad I got to tell you how much I respect you
You was our beginning you gave us our sound
"Ain't No Future In Yo Frontin" gave us reason to be proud
Instead of being a city under a dark cloud
You gave us a reason to say Flint and say it loud
The first rapper I ever knew as a child it made me smile
And as a grown man I still get that same feeling now
I never listen to the haters, never listen to the comments
Cause I promise that my remake was a tribute paying hommage
And I dont want no sympathy ain't do it for publicity
I guess it was just in me to do it for your memory
Never tought that I get backlash for that song
Cause how could such good intentions get taken so wrong?
But when Erica came and hug me with tears in her eyes
I knew that what I did was right and felt your tears from the sky, love
