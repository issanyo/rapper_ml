[Verse 1]
Not to sound cocky, not even the cops could stop me
It’s like Rocky vs. Pacquiao when I pack the house, tell ‘em ‘bout me
Hol' up, as fate would have it, saw a brass ring and I grabbed it
Don’t believe in hustling backwards , tryna backtrack to a backflip
One shot to a hat trick, getting money overseas, my money talk with an accent
They say life is a bitch, well, my bitch is bad as a Braxton, passion and wisdom
Got my people screaming so loud, break the glass in the window
Go and say fuck me on a track and let’s make it official
Best in the world, mothafucka, let’s make it an issue
Niggas hate, but I’m finta, give faith to the simple you fake
‘Til the day you gon’ break, this is fate ‘cause they just can’t relate to my mental
This a cliffhanger that ain’t even suspenseful
Jump off a cliff trying to reach the sky, you’ll never reach your potential
That’s too much living with my back against the wall,  I’m too clutch
It’s Aftermath in this muthafucka, we don’t do much
Kill the game, R.I.P,  y’all go ahead and suit up
Come on, come on, let’s go

[Hook]
This ain’t no accident
This ain’t no bubble gum rapping, fuck it, I’m passionate
It’s Aftermath in this bitch, this ain’t no slap on the wrist
It’s rock and roll, mothafucka, I’m in the dough, mothafucka
You slacking, I know exactly what you did last summer
I’m guilt-tripping, I’m tripping, no, I don’t owe niggas nothing
Guess rappers don’t know the difference between going and coming
I’m here to stay, ‘cause shit I ain’t go through all this for nothing

[Verse 2]
Look, I tell ‘em stop, you should probably reconsider
Cause you not hot,by the set standards that we consider
The game is a bitter bitch right now, it need a nigga
Believe I won’t leave ‘til my people viva la vida, nigga
Do not mention my name and I will not mention you either, nigga
Thinking you will take over, I will give you that Ether, nigga
Brought that dog out me, a pit up off of it's leash, my nigga
Fuck you, suck my dick, and that was just freedom of speech my nigga
Michigan here to stay, ain't no way that they can impeach a nigga
Then say thanks to Dr. Dre for unleashing a beast, my nigga
Every joint is food for thought, this a piece of a feast, my nigga
But one piece of shit I spit make you obese, my nigga
You got babymomma drama, my bitch on a beach, my nigga
Street smarts, that ain’t something you can teach, my nigga
So for the streets I make people come out they seats, my nigga
For real

[Interldude]
Man I’m from a little bitty city, man
Small town nigga, man, Flint Michigan
So shit, all I want is a chance to tell our story
For real though, People’s rapper, you feel me

[Verse 3]
Nigga I never had it, but it never mattered
Niggas grimy, bitches ratchet, living below average
Ain’t tryna see no casket, hit me
If in my sleep the reaper get me hen I hope that the Lord forgive me
‘Cause when I go, some of y’all niggas coming with me
For Flint Michigan, my new position in sucka' Christening
Crystal clear, paint vivid pictures if you listenin’
My flows a trip for this experience, say thanks for visitin’
Got both feet planted in this game, roots coming out my Timberlands
I had high hopes like I smoke, giving y’all bars like five-o
And if life sang me a sad song I sang end this bitch on a high note
Got a story to tell, this story is history
Guts and glory, trying to get on down , they tore me to hell
I’m living a dream ,my nigga, a dream, I’m on my wake up
Banging bitches that’s bad as hell without no make-up
My make up is real shit, don’t ever get it twisted
You can find niggas who lyrics is this realistic
Past the present, I must have missed it
See this is passion and you can’t fake it
My whole city riding with me, told them we was gonna make it
We made it

[Hook]
