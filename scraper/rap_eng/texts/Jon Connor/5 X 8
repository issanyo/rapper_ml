[Verse 1: Maffew Ragazino]
Ragazino, S-R, period
Ain't a nigga better than him, period
Purists got me confused for a backpack syndicate
When I'm planning to take over the whole fucking business
The Great Black Hope, it's Maffew, bitches
Either I'm The One or The Matrix has glitches
How dare you speak on the illest
And neglect to mention that I'm the best
What the fuck? Do I gotta die to convince 'em?

[Verse 2: Action Bronson]
A thousand miles apart
Just two degrees from a straight line
Bottles of vintage hanging, clinging from the grapevine
Olives pressed, greenish on the glimmer
Get me on the court, shoot from anywhere like Jimmer
Barrel revolution, spinning like a hula hoop
All these rappers breakfast
Steaming up the yuca root
Queens native, mention with the greats already
Don't even talk to me unless the fucking paper ready

[Verse 3: Homeboy Sandman]
Not another insecure MC, thank God
Peter, this is a phat beat, nice job
Congrats on the engagement to Lex, too
I'll be at the wedding shaving piraguas off the ice swans
The last part shouldn't sound bizarre
You've been in New York City long enough
You should know what piraguas are
The last bar that I'm writing
Is...I laugh while I'm fighting

[Verse 4: Kaimbr]
Flag of that new Confederate slash helter shit, uh
The concrete the color of Welch's
Flow so cold and my hope is that your name come in
Serve rhymes over crushed Red Velvet
Ma, circulate your pelvis
Show 'em how to ride it
Couldn't bury me like Elvis
Melt 'em, uh, I'm with the elders
Teeing off at Elkridge
Flights on my right
Minus off something Keltic

[Verse 5: Jon Connor]
I'm Troy Aikman and Pat Bateman
You Clay Aiken
Every flow is shocking
Take this taste to the face
Face it
I make hits in this game word to the 3rd Bassment
Every verse, not a verb wasted
With words, I'm a superb Jason
Murder tracks
Fuck walking in my shoes
You couldn't even lace 'em
Niggas gassed, I deflate 'em
I eat 'em early, they bacon
I'll burn a spot until it feel like it's baking
Think I'm scorching now?
My future's hotter than a Satanist
Haha!
