Somebody tell me who current, now they spotting for certain
I'm the new wave of wipe them out watch them run from my current
Show my dick to the world, ain't seen nothing as perverted
Since Pee Wee Herman jerking in public, can you picture that perfect
So provocative, drop more power, more potent than vodka is
I am the fly City, where superman is the Metropolis
How he do it, he keep more coming, keep dropping on top of shit
They be thinking they heard his hottest shit
Then he just top the shit
I am, the best in the world, I'm the ultimate optimist
I am currently in my prime, they calling me Optimus
Follow this here's why the people fond to this
I'm a motherfucker like I fondled your mama's tits
While I see if the condom fits huh?
This is dominance, I be making hits and I don't know if I'm a miss
Y'all hollowed out on empty promises
Just lay down I know you tired of this
But now you're tied to this
And I admit my lyrics tighter than a viper's grip
Go ahead, get mad, homie, I am your step dad
This nigga's fucking mommy and you just gotta accept that
Imagine me telling you you was laying where we have sex at
We laying on your bed, she doing what she was best at
Ewww, your motherfuckers know the deal
Your career make your mom wish that she was on the pill
When I say I run game that just mean I play the field
'Til my warm up drills look like a highlight real
Go and shine, I get the lime light still
I'm ahead of my time, this how hindsight feel
Now I'm talking big banks, get your mind right feel
Cause I'd rather go out like Will if you will
One time in the sky if you real
I tell wack niggas, nigga chill, you for real?
Cold flow people get chills when they hear them
I'm so fly, just flew by nigga, eeeeeeuuuuummm
And I can't stop
I hate when niggas in the game come up to me
Trying to name drop
Fuck them, supposed to be impressed another nigga name hot
Yo name nothing, I'm just tryna make my name pop
9 times out of 10 we probably in the same spot
But niggas think they bigger than they is
That's why the game shot, fake niggas lost
Soon as the fame stop, that's why
OG's embrace me, like I hit the game shot
Keep hitting with these lines, where the pain stop?
Nobody better, flow is wetter than a raindrop
Scorching, you can tell nigga I'm Kane hot
Headstrong: brain on the same shit that Bane got
Worldwide, in India, need a Topagna in Bangkok
Animal on the dick like I trained her to bang cock
Hot shit, like there's flames on my veins
Ah, my brakes shot, that just mean that I can't stop
