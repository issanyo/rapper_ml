[Chorus]
Ooh, baby, do you know that's rough
Ooh, Heaven is a place on earth
They say in Heaven, love comes first
We'll make Heaven our place on earth
Ooh, Heaven is a place on earth (x4)

[Verse 1: Jon Connor]
They used to try and play me like you ain't never gonna blow
And now I can charge 10 racks for a show
And ain't that funny when you don't give a fuck
About money that's when it all comes
I remember doing shows with the mic too low
And the beat too loud and you're losing the crowd
Hearing boos from the crowd, now I'm moving the crowd
Getting every chick that I choose from the crowd
Gave my all at the the hole in the wall
So me and my niggas can go in and close out the mall
Blue City Club (You know)
Believe in my niggas I leave no doubt of my squad
Tattooed on my arm, it's embedded in the pain
Like the pain from the slaves
Breaking free from the chains
We was all dirt poor before we came in the game
That's why all my niggas gonna bleed for their change
Driving round the city with my arm out the window
Thinkin 'bout the days that I couldn't
Difference between me and you, niggas can't see me
Niggas see you but there ain't nobody looking
Look, they be like Connor why you go so hard?
Cause my momma can't play cards in her backyard
Without thinking 'bout how close were the shots
Now we on the kitchen floor like lights out in the house
Nigga, I never doubted myself
When I ain't had no help and I was by myself
Now I'm in Rock the Bells
Next to DJ Premier
Damn how'd I get here?
Shit it don't feel real
Every year is my year
And y'all looking at me now like I just appeared
I worked hard to get here, talk to me now

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Oh shit, pardon me for being rude
Let me officially introduce y'all to Season 2
Thank y'all for sharing this with me I appriciate it
Paradise is whatever you make it, you feel me?
If you want shit to change for you you gotta change, do you feel me?
If you want something to happen for you you gotta make it happen
The People's Rapper
Let's go

[Chorus]
