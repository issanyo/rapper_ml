[Intro]

[Verse 1]
I ain't sorry for not giving up
Look where I ended up
But being humble for so long
Pushed me to the point that i don't give a fuck
Sacrificed half my life, while niggas was living good
Thinking, "If I got so much talent, why the fuck I'm in the hood?"
No sympathy for none of these niggas, no compassion
Try to hold me back; this payback, my satisfaction
I think about all these shows and the promoters that try to ho us
And to my soldiers: thank god we ain't give up like they told us
See, bitch niggas praying for my downfall
Smiling in my face, that's why I stay the fuck from around y'all
Fake niggas acting like we cool cause they know I rap
Then they turn around and call me fake cause I ain't act like I know them back
My status changed, but I didn't
They fuck me over and just move on like I ain't 'posed to remember
This to my folks that held me down, I'ma hold you down till my casket drop
Hell nah, I can't stop; haters, just sit back and watch
And they know that I got

No apologies these days
No apologies these days
No apologies these days
No apologies these days

[Verse 2]
Broke as fuck, sitting up
Dreaming about the days, that i will be paid
Reminiscing on all of the days
My momma would slave
Ate the same shit for six days and never complained
"Least you eating something," was the food that's feeding my brain
Went to private school, but it was fucked up here where i stayed
Sacrifice my mom made to make sure my tuition was paid
Hood niggas jealous cause they thinking I'm better than them
Kids at school talk like i ain't on the same level as them
Fucked up, confused and hurt
The home of the brave, where bullets get sprayed
Two yards away from where little kids play
Till this day it's the same shit
Ain't nothing changed
Not from no hoping or no slogan, or no fucking campaign
Come and visit where i grew up at
You would swear to god this where the atomic bomb blew up at
I tell em fuck what you think about my history
Cause half these niggas mad about what they think I had
And don't know half, so kiss my ass and i got

No apologies these days
No apologies these days

[Verse 3]
It's like: my cousin died, granny died, Mani died; ain't quit
Laid my head down at night, gunfire; can't quit
Poverty across the globe, identical, same shit
But if it ain't affecting us, we acting like it ain't shit
In the days where we care more about the presentation than the information
That's why we'll go to a concert before a demonstration
This ain't 'bout my people, y'all people
Homie, this for all people
So y'all don't forget the fact we are people
A life is priceless worth more than gas prices
Ain't trying to be righteous, but it shouldn't take death to unite us
I don't vote so don't ask, let's get it clear
Cause no matter who the president, my city gets worse every motherfucking year
See, we feel like we ain't got no voice
Cause believe we in these conditions by design and not by choice
And this the real news, I'm just reporting what I'm seeing
I'm speaking for the people, if you looking for the reason, I got

No apologies these days
No apologies these days
No apologies these days
