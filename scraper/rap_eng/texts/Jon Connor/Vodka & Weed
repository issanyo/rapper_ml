[Verse 1 - Jon Connor]
I tell the bitch don't kiss my lips
Cause I don't know you like that and I ain't tryin to
So you down to get drunk and fuck on the first night?
Where the fuck did they find you?
You ain't ever did shit like this, me either
Who the fuck is we lyin' to?
By the way, your girls look thirsty. Tell em all get in line too
I ain't mistakin' any hoes be with it
Don't be mad cause you wack and all stank and your girl did let me hit it
They be throwin' it at me and I be fuckin' like I'm fresh out of prison
Maybe they should lock me up cause it's illegal, it's unsafe to do it
In this position, marathon, no intermission
Keep mackin' these hoes, vibe for this scenario
I lose the deuces no I don't fuck with scary-o
She tries to fuck with me cause her nigga is very broke
Your girl all in. What, you tryin' to get married for?

[Hook (x2)]
Vodka and some weed got your girl on the floor
Vodka, vodka and some weed got your girl on the floor

[Verse 2 - Jon Connor]
I tell that hoe, don't kiss my mouth
Why? That's just the rule, you lose
And besides this is my house. Bitch try me, there's so many ways that I can say
"Bitch, get out." You think I ain't know
But all them niggas you hit up on your momma's couch
And after what we just did, I ain't got no dough ho
You been around the block
And I ain't got time cause you been workin' these niggas
Around the clock. Maury Povich shit, nine niggas deep
And still ain't find the pops. She got out the hood, owing child support, and niggas can't be
Around the cops. And your homegirl down to watch, oh shit
Yeah, I hit that girl a long time ago. Why you bringi'n up old shit?
You just sucked my man, now you wanna kiss me? Nuh uh
Gross bitch, cause I ain't the first and won't be the last
She can run the game, don't need to ask
Now she on the pole, did you see her ass?
