[Intro: DJ Khaled and Jon Connor]
[DJ Khaled]
Classic shit! (Biggie)
Jon Connor!
Kick in the door (Biggie)
You know what it is!
[Jon Connor]
Why like...
Why Connor season nigga?
Why put out this shit?
Thats cause i give a fuck man
The People's Rapper
I give a fuck about what i do
You feel me?

[Verse 1: Jon Connor]
Till' the day that they bury Jon
I'm probably run marathons
Round rappers that's barely average
Its scary I'm really wrong
Yeah, I'm feeling myself
You can tell he got hairy palms
Hits that I never miss
They compare me to Barry Bonds
Scream "fuck you!"
Then carry on
I barely take carry-on's
Got bitches in every city
A gift from the fairy God
I ain't kissing this bitches
They better off kiss frogs
Remember they used to starve now i'm fucking them in a stall
I'll make you moves like I made the rules
Nigga stay confused
Question what i do
And I thought you just [?]

[Verse 2: Jon Connor]
Oh it ain't a act
What the fuck I supposed to say to that?
If Flint haters smacked
Then make them take it back
Or take a nap
Real niggas, real niggas, real niggas
I'm from a city with real killers
That will kill ya'
Look:
And I don't brag about the murder rate
Cause that'd hurt my state
Michigan need me, So this verse'll be my murder case
I burn the place, you don't believe
Oh you gon' learn today, haters turn to fake
Now they making the Pee-Wee Herman face
Fuck you if you with them, what I'm gon' do with them?
I feel like Terrio, I feel like "oooh kill them"
I feel like you bitches wear it if the shoe fit it
Only thing on my mind is money and a new fitted

[Verse 3: Jon Connor]
I never ask a bitch whose is it?
Cause they be quick to say 'you'
But on the low be fuckin' two niggas
See I remind you of the golden age
How I can go for days
My lyrics slow to age
Im dope i spit that dro and haze
And I control the stage, you misread me
Nigga you don't even know my pay
I hate a hater like they owned a slave
They say I'm on my way
I feel like I'm already home
Been ready since the sensational sherry and i was barely grown
Talking about the future of music and how I would do it
Wanted to prove it and make the Judas look stupid
You know my tape was the hottest shit out
Even if you skimed through it
Yeah I love his game
And the game love' me like i'm kin to it
No, I don't run out, I outrun niggas
Until they outdone
Till the point you don't question the outcome
Hell of a bout son
But this lines make you knocking out fun
After this Connor season
I see it, just watch the drought come
What?

Just give me [?]

[Outro: Jon Connor]
Another one, salute from Michigan
