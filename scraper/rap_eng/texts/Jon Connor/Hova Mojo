[Intro]
I’m shocked
You know if you asked me how i look at the music business now, I’m shocked
With there, not only with a lack of talent, but also with the lack of talent thats getting away with a lack of talent. People still buying the songs, their not buying the artist their buying the songs. Which is much different right, your not buying into the artists criteria or what they stand for. Your buying into the 3 minutes 45 seconds that they give you now and again

[Jon Connor Talking]
People is like man you just came off season 2, like what is the motivation of going and finishing another project in 5 days. I mean cause, people gotta understand. This is not enough. See where y'all see me at and where i want to be at is worlds apart. So if i gotta keep killin shit, and killin shit, and killin shit, to get where i gotta go, thats what imma do

[Chorus: Jon Connor]
They keep saying that my day gon', gon'
My day gon' come
Tell em that my day gon', gon'
My day gon' come
I know, I know, I know
Don’t nobody know that better than me
My day gon', gon'
My day gon' gon'
My day gon' come
I know, I know, I know
Don’t nobody know that better than me

[Verse 1: Jon Connor]
I’m still working, if you was uncertain
I am ready for war, word to Bin Laden’s turban
Verses so perfect, It’s like the verses you hear in churches
It almost don’t feel right like we sacrificing a virgin
You see the snakes coming, look in the eyes of a serpent
I dissect niggas look in the eyes of a surgeon
KKK Crossed me I will burn them
Ain’t no better feeling than getting rid of a burden
My life is a movie and you will be Tim Burton
Follow the direction of my people that need service
Life is a bitch me and my niggas take turns with
I'mma main stay in the game I dun' turned Durwin
The five day predator
Now when you say Jon Connor the last thing you think is the dude from predator
Busta told me that the flow gon' touch areas
Deep outta my region, i’m takin over america

[Chorus: Jon Connor]


[Verse 2: Jon Connor]
We livin in a era where it ain’t about dope rhymes
When beef is online and how big is your co-sign
The game should feel stupid, I was here the whole time
Hot flows over hot beats nigga the whole nine
They don’t want whats next nigga
They want that next nigga that sound like the next nigga
Yes nigga
And I won’t rest until they say i’m the best
Till they live with regrets and they can’t live with themselves
Wonder why CDs don’t sell when they hit the shelves
Think they can repackage the same shit and we can’t tell
Play this and know that i’m sick I ain’t well
Keep tryna find a flaw you can’t find what ain’t there
The games mine they keep trying to claim what ain’t theres
Look like you seen a ghost whats with all the blank stares
I spit raw they never seen nothin this rare
And now I want the world, I just hope they prepared

[Chorus: Jon Connor]
