[Verse 1: Jon Connor]
I done been through ex's, I done been through best friends
So it would seem the game was all I was left with
So I eat tracks 'til I get indigestion
Hungry naw that means ain't addin' up to what I'm digestin'
Did this on my only, fuck what you suggestin'
Where was you a year ago I have no recollection
Talkin' like you know me I can't make the connection
Now the flow is sick niggas is bitin my infection
Niggas on my dick please let me enjoy my erection
Spit that hot shit that shit that change niggas complexion
Change niggas direction, I care so I correct you
It's been a long time my baby I shouldn't have left you
Not to be a dead beat, but niggas is dead meat
Heart of a lion, niggas is lookin like red meat
My spirit ain't dyin' that's why niggas respect me
Fuckers turn they back, they thought I'd be right where they left me
Well, let me inform you, shit I'm tryin' to warn you
Niggas wanna visit just to see if hell is warm
Motherfuckin' Flinstone, yeah I spit that brimstone
Hits like it's fist thrown, just listen to this song
The day I give up will be the day that I get pissed on
Lock me in a room full of fags and I'll get kissed on
Never been a quitter just a nigga wit a vision
Never knew how to do it no other way than with precision
Shit I gave it all up, yeah I gave it all up
Fuck workin' at Starbucks, I'm tryin to make Star bucks
Flow outta this world watch me turn this bitch to Star Wars
Shit I'm George Lucas combined with Frank Lucas
They say he the next one, they say he a problem
Put him with the Biggie's and the Pac's and the Nas's
The Jigga's and the Kanye's, the Em's and the Andre's
I'mma need a doctor preferably Andre
Before I fuck the first chick I'm thinkin' 'bout the next two
Once I go to sleep I can't remember who I'm next to
I know that you a legend when they say someone's the next you
So this track's another murder I gotta confess to
Look. My voice is the people's choice
From the mitten I give them that feelin of when niggas was spittin' my adrenaline buildin'
See my pen to this paper's revenge to the haters
Quickly makin' them take a vacation
See I'm the Mav's to they Laker's
If you don't like me that's cool, I probably don't fuck with you either
But it ain't gon' stop me from spittin' ether and giving you heaters
Rappers I eat 'em they wrapped in pitas
I fought for the comin' fetus
Niggas that try to see me they windin' up seeing Jesus
Dammit they can't ignore me
My stories look glorious
Fuck the world like I'm horny 40 and on re-record me
I'mma show you I got guts man up cause it's 'bout to get gory
I spit like this for the niggas that spit like this before me
Vintage 'til niggas come back to they sisters
Keep lookin' for that dope shit, I'mma put black in they system
Every track is a victim, got immaculate diction
I'll run in a pack of whack rappers get snatched decapitated and left on they back, twitchin'
I got my state on my back, Michigan
Hold me down, 'til I come back with the crown '04 Pistons
Givin' 'em hope I'm a rose grown from the concrete
All I know is hard bars like hearin' a con speak
Ready for the long haul, all of ya'll get dog walked
Bite the hand that feeds you, and now I'm sawin' your paws off
Try to walk that off, stab me in the back but your claw's soft
Let me lead the way cause ya'll all lost, gone
