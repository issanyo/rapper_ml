[Verse 1: Justin Daye]
It's a god damn shame
They ain't even know my name
But they don't wanna even know that everything changed
Now a nigga in the game
Now a nigga got all the money, hoes
Now a nigga got fame
Can't do shit else
Like I'm gonna lose myself
Gotta pay dues myself
Gotta pay these bills

Now I'm tryna pay pills

Back there niggas take away what they could tho
Fuck that, ima do me
Till the world blow
Rap like
Styed up, late up
Video shit, don't stop

Button on the stop, watch

Deal with it, still with it

Ima go in, ima kill with it
Got this whole shit, like a real nigga
Fuck everyone else
Nigga who care
No fucks given
Like I was still a virgin
And I ain't women
But don't call this a comeback
Cause I been running this shit
Like I run tracks
But I run laps
Y'all on your first lap

[Hook]
Nigga, this my life
Don't hate on me cause of this shit I show
Flex at the beauty shows and the videos
Nigga, this my life
Got to hold it down for the niggas that stay the same
Nigga, this my life
Don't worry bout me cause a nigga will never change

[verse 2]
A nigga can't tell me shit but a nigga that did it
They say old boy got shot
He was robbin (?)
That's fucked up
But I swear that (?)
Get your own feel like a man when you finally finished
I'm out of this world so I guess for me sky ain't the limit
You know it's official if that nigga Swift up in it
If it ain't loud
Wouldn't allow it low
My people start tripping
I tell em it ain't shit
Scream out bitch, I'm a boss
When I cop, I ain't slippin'
Hammer cocked at the camera spot
If you think I was slippin'

You would think I was missing
My nigga, I'm so don
You would think I was Vincent
Since I went to private school
They looked at me different
It's all dollar sign

While yo momma was picking
New times for the kitchen
My momma was tryna keep her sons out the (?)

[Hook]
Nigga, this my life
Don't hate on me cause of this shit I show
Flex the beauty shows and the videos
Nigga, this my life
Got to hold it down for the niggas that stay the same
Nigga, this my life
Don't worry bout me cause a nigga will never change

[Verse 3: Jon Connor]
Fuck this shit, they ain't really did it
But they really on limit
I know a lot of gangstas

Motherfuckers going old like O-Dog
I done seen niggas getting ahoud of they selves
And get their god damn head blown off
If a nigga say shit, he probably do it
Niggas push and
Y'all pray for my city

A nigga die everyday, that's just another day in my city
Life's a bitch when you sit on the fence
Shit too real, that shit's too real
I'm ducking these hoes
And I'm ducking these niggas
Young niggas beefing, no bullshit
See, try to get out of that
Hold it down and represent for the homies lost
Shit my life was losing homies young
And seeing yellow (?)
Kept positive
But shit could have went another way

[Hook]
Nigga, this my life
Don't hate on me cause of this shit I show
(?) for the beauty shows and the videos
Nigga, this my life
Got to hold it down for the niggas that stay the same
Nigga, this my life
Don't worry bout me cause a nigga will never change
