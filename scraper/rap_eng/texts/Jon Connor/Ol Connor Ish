Y’all know how I do, keeping y’all company till the next project drop
Unconscious State on the way

A smart nigga with a mike, oh no
Somebody take it, somebody disconnect the cable
Somebody break it, somebody make it
So they can’t hear nothing he’s saying
Cause if they do, they’ll probably reconsider what they playing
I am the enemy, I’m the remedy
I’m a spark mind from John F. Kennedy
Know the world ain’t end on December 21st
But instead of being scared, straight I’m scared
We just getting worse
Preachers fuckin our youth, we ain’t even safe in the church
I’m tryin to get to your mind if tv ain’t get to it first
Reality show our funerals, I just watch in disgust
I watched a nigga hit a bitch with a uppercut on the bus
I used to have to find porno mags under my dad mattress
Nowadays, you know how easy downloading a porno app is?
They watching fucking at the push of a button
She 14 and having a baby, should have knew that was coming
All we see nowadays is money and fuckin
All of my niggas got kids
Cause one of them easy and the other one wasn’t
Is it art imitating life or life imitating art?
Regardless, I lost mine, can’t tell ‘em apart
Dumb rap sales, I see that I ain’t blind
Look how that was designed
Give a fuck if I make a dime when I rhyme
I wanna sell like Gotye and Adele
I see em winnin, makin music with feeling and still sellin them millions
You rap niggas sell out and still flop
Making bullshit music to get to the top and you still not
17 years and the realest nigga is still Pac

Abusing the mike, you worse than the nigga that killed Pac
Why? Cause the more we glorify and accept stupid
I play the mind and this generation can’t connect to it
My grandparents went through racism and lock outs
Now we got rights and lil’ niggas can’t wait to drop out
We worship celebrities like they perfect
When they gon’ die just like you one day
It’s the only thing that’s certain
If y’all could only see behind the curtain
Half the shit you watch, have the intent to devaluate a person
I like em natural, fuck the fake knockers
Shit, my dream girl is Jennifer Hudson before the Weight Watchers
Been in the game now it’s my time and I’m taking my menace
If it have handles haters still couldn’t hold my attention
The realest nigga act cool like I’m holding auditions
Fly city niggas die for acting suspicious
Imagine growing up, living in them conditions
Niggas trying to kill you everyday can kill your spirit
Females be knowin who I am now so I don’t trust em
I know lady in the hood fuckin her daughter’s husband
I know a nigga in the hood fuckin his girl’s cousin
So before I let a person fuck me, I’d rather say fuck it
People and loyal is like water and oil
Watch me, I don’t take breaks and I won’t break
And that’s why they can’t stop me
When you confident, insecure niggas say that you cocky
Punching these lines, I say that I’m rocky they hate it they not me
This is my thoughts and I be on all kind of shit
This is for my fans that wanted that ol’ Connor shit, go!
