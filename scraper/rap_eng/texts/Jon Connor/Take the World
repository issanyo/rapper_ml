[Hook: Lia Mack]
Everyday I wake up (Whoa, Whoa)
I go back to sleep to the same dream
As impossible as it may seem
I'm gonna take the world this time, world this time, world this time (x2)
I'm gonna take the world, I'm gonna take the world
As impossible as it may seem
I'm gonna take the world this time, world this time, world this time (x2)

[Verse 1: Lyric Da Queen]
Whoever said real MCs don't exist no more
Y'all people living under rocks
I know a lot of rappers who deserve a deal including me
But I ain't selling out to make it to the top
I don't need nobody props
Give me respect and I'm straight
Recognize the fact that I'm buzzing in each state
I'm even getting love in Europe, the UK
I ain't living in the past I'm living for today
I ain't got time to worry what you say
Tried to stop what I was doing a little bit too late
The moment that I realized that I was above average
Gave me the courage to let go of the bad baggage
Every underdog gets a turn
Cecause they tried to overlook us, but y'all finna learn
Still on the same old thing
Still waking up from the same old dreams
And I be like, oh

[Hook: Lia Mack]
Everyday I wake up (Whoa, Whoa)
I go back to sleep to the same dream
As impossible as it may seem
I'm gonna take the world this time, world this time, world this time (x2)
I'm gonna take the world, I'm gonna take the world
As impossible as it may seem
I'm gonna take the world this time, world this time, world this time (x2)

[Verse 2: Jon Connor]
I remember sleeping on the Greyhound
I got up, they wish I would've stayed down
I remember staying up the whole night
I've been waiting for this shit my whole life
I don't make excuses, I just make good music
And I check my lumps and enjoy my bruises
They said I'm not, but I know I am
They said I can't, but I know I can

[Hook: Lia Mack]
Everyday I wake up (Whoa, Whoa)
I go back to sleep to the same dream
As impossible as it may seem
I'm gonna take the world this time, world this time, world this time (x2)
I'm gonna take the world, I'm gonna take the world
As impossible as it may seem
I'm gonna take the world this time, world this time, world this time (x2)

[Bridge x2: Jenna Noelle]
My life begins with every breath
I take it in, then send it back
I can see a sparkling view, want to know how?
Cause I gotta do, keep the pain
Got to see this through, cause nothing is impossible

[Hook: Lia Mack]
Everyday I wake up (Whoa, Whoa)
I go back to sleep to the same dream
As impossible as it may seem
I'm gonna take the world this time, world this time, world this time (x2)
I'm gonna take the world, I'm gonna take the world
As impossible as it may seem
I'm gonna take the world this time, world this time, world this time (x2)
