[Verse 1: Jon Connor]
They say who is he? The genius speaking in broken English
Observing behind the curtain, your mind too preoccupied to see it
We hard-headed, thoughts made of cement
The writing's on the wall, but we don’t read it
We don’t read while we defeated
Another rapper -- like we fucking need it
See this ain’t rapping, this is teaching
And what I preach the reason that I’m breathing
See, for them people I would gladly take my last breath
See I got drive til there ain’t no gas left
I-75 that’s my address, I’m on the road and I ain’t had rest
Hoping that my past steps don't add stress
See I ain’t flawless, so no matter what, I'm talking
Regardless is the fact that karma gon’ catch up to all us
And my bars is just a penance till I chill with Chris Wallace
When I get to them pearly gates, and it ain't gonna matter what’s in my wallet
Look, it’s only one of me, so it’s gonna be what is gonna be
The person that I truly envy is the one I wanna be

[Hook: Lia Mack]
What I want
What I got to be

[Verse 2: Jon Connor]
See, different people got agendas
They pretend to see they come in different genders
They befriend us like they feel us, like they with us
Then we’re asking God for help, but then the test is what he send us
Then we’re saying Lord forgive us cause the truth is always in us
When it's finished we just hope, we gave directions to an infant
Cause we’re here to break the spirits that’s gon' shake the world they live in
Living in the villa or go visit them in prison
It come down to one decision, that’s why when we talk, they listen
That’s what I ain’t giving up, or act like I don’t give a fuck
They’ll be like bro, hold me down, but I'd rather pick ‘em up!
We tell ‘em reach for the stars so I try to lift em up
Ya'll keep on slowing them down to the point they end up stuck
I’m attacking the faculty that would stop me and hassle me
They say I wouldn’t be shit watching all this rapping and wrassling
In myself I was adamant, what the fuck did you want from me?
Now I’m living my dream, and I’m exactly where I wanna be

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Jon Connor]
Let’s get it clear, we are all one
This word "nigga," tell me this
What’s worse -- being one, or being called one?
Cause if you one, then we all one
Cause other races gonna judge me on the last time they saw one
Go grab a mike or a ball, son; how fucking backwards is that?
Do you know the odds to make it rap?
And your chance to make it in hoop is even slimmer than that
If you can’t do one of the two, your only option's to shoot
When the niggas you look up to on the block is not in a suit
When they're glorifying the rocks that they got the cops in pursuit
When one of your niggas die, you don’t cry and you just salute
Like his death is a badge of honor til death come looking for you
Reality shows got girls thinking acting ratchet is cute
When in fact this bitch is an actress -- the actual fool is you
And we always wanna argue, fussing, fighting, and cuss
'fore point the finger at them, let’s point one at us
What we wanna be?

[Hook]

[Outro: Lia Mack]
I’ll never seen the world taking me down down, taking me down
I’ll never seen the world taking me down down, taking me down
I’ll never seen the world taking me down down, taking me down
I’ll never seen the world taking me down down, taking me down
