[Intro]
Yeah, look..

[Verse 1]
Welcome to the world
Where everybody thinks you got it
Friends are all in your business
Family all in your pocket
Everybody's an expert on what you got in your wallet
For Christmas they look to you to put candy canes in their Stockings
Every night you have an experience that you wanna share
And you call home excited, But it feel like nobody care
They can't relate, so they selfish
They feel like this isn't fair
So you Wishin' that they was here, and they wishing that you was there
New life, new life
Getting used to my new life
Driving myself crazy
Tryin' to keep up with two lives
Met  this girl from London
I think she's cool as fuck
While my girl back up
Still keeping stressed the fuck out
Now see, do you stay stressed just to keep it real?
Or move on and have people think you changed
Because of your deal?
Started not to give a fuck how people look at me
Cause You Only Live Once
I'm just doing what make me happy

[Hook w/ Jon Connor ad-libs]
As i recall
I know you love to show off
But I never thought that you would take it this far
But what do i know
What do i know
Ohh

[Verse 2]
Feeling isolated because of your occupation
People sayin' you stunt in your everyday conversation
Dog, nah I ain't tryin't to stunt
But that's where it gets complicated
This shit you think is amazing
I do on a daily basis
The names you say it in the face
I use them in every day phrase
I be singing your favourites
When it's not a special occasion
So when I talk to my folks
I just wanna hear something basic
Now, did I meet Eminem?
And who Kendrick go on a date with?
Look, sometimes you just wanna be the person you were
Before you were a MC
Ironic how the things you leave on this fast track
Are the very things you wish you could have back
Like when your homeboys used to talk about girls
But it's funny, wouldn't trade this life for the world
But I guess life is balanced and it is a compromise
For a part you have to live
For a part of you has to die

[Hook w/ Jon Connor ad-libs]

[Verse 3]
I wish I coulda got my old girl to get me
I wish I coulda brought my whole hood with me
Wish there wasn't a thin line between patience and envy
I wish the innocence I had as a child was still in me
It's funny how your old friends turn into your rivals
And exchange, to become best friends with your idols
And It's more about your character and less about your titles
One hand to the Lord, The other hand to the Bible
Now everybody acts wild
Cause they got expectations of success in you
And how you're supposed to act now
I haven't changed but don't nothing feel the same
I was dyin' to get on, another casualty of the game
"No biz like showbiz", we already know dat
Quitting is not an option, I came too far to go back
With every fake smile, and every fake laugh
A piece of your soul goes with every light flash

[Hook w/ Jon Connor ad-libs]

[Outro]
I'm just here to tell y'all
Cause ain't nobody tell me
Life is balance
There is no such thing as "having it all"
The things that you receive
Are only the payoff for things that you give up
Flashing Lights
Best in the World
