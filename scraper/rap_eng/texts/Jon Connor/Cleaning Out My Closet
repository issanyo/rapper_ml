I know this shit don't work out for everybody, but
I ain't everybody
I'm me

[Verse 1: Jon Connor]
You ever wanted something so bad you'd do anything for it?
Feel it in your soul and people telling you to ignore it
Like you could go to sleep, wake up and it be gone in the morning
Your parents saying it's a phase, act like the shit ain't important
People see your passion, intentionally try to kill it
They mad at they self, for you chasing your dream and they didn't
Cause the thought of you winnin' only makin' 'em bitter
They think they hate you but they hate they self for being a quitter
As time goes on they block it out and they try not to remember
Can't escape it, gotta face it when they look in the mirror
They was you at one point and they still tryin' to forget it
But fear beat 'em in the end and they don't wanna admit
How could they guide you or ever give you advice
When half the time they complainin', bitchin' 'bout what's wrong with they life
About all the shit they wish they could change if they could do it twice
Just get it right the first time instead of rolling the dice
They tellin' you the chance of makin' it is one in a million, they lyin'
It's workin', you're the only one that was willin'
They try to discourage you cause they know for them now it's too late
Misery love company and they want you as a roommate
Now your skin gettin' thicker hard to control your emotions
When the lack of support comes from the one who's the closest
When your mother and your father is what's throwin' your focus
Y'all can argue all you want but this how you close it

[Hook: Eminem]
I'm sorry momma
I never meant to hurt you
I never meant to make you cry; but tonight
I'm cleanin' out my closet (one more time)
I said I'm sorry momma
I never meant to hurt you
I never meant to make you cry; but tonight
I'm cleanin' out my closet

[Verse 2: Jon Connor]
I think about all the friends I had that abandoned they hopes
Living with regrets cause they tried to live up to they folks
Or a destructive relationship that drove 'em off of they path
They other half drainin' them of every dream that they had
I seen women wit a vision let a nigga distract 'em
Have a plan, she get a man and she she start hustlin' backwards
So preoccupied with him and drama with other bitches
She be down and can't get up to get on top of her business
I seen dudes that want the pat on the back from they chick
Hell'll freeze over two times over, he ain't gettin that shit
Because of this, his ambition is driven away
Look in you for inspiration even if you gotta say I'm

[Hook]
