My big brother is Em's brother, Eazy-E, Yella, and Ren's brother
Who was Ice Cube's brother, who was D.O.C.'s friend
And became my mentor, now let the story begin

[Verse: 1]
Lets start at the "Live from the underground" tour with KRIT
Second leg of the tour they sent me back to Flint
I'm feeling under pressure because it feels like in this business
When you think you're about to make it, they can take it in a second
But much to my surprise it was a blessing in disguise
When life was beating a nigga, I got a DM on Twitter
It was Xzibit like "You wanna go on a run?", I never been to Canada
Sound like this shit could be fun, so every night killing shit just to get my art out
Stage after stage I'm rapping my fuckin' heart out
X game me props because he seen I was good
Said "he would help me if he got in a position he would"
But right after that tour, I was back in the hood
Just grateful for that opportunity, and I understood
That it was back to the grind, dropped Unconscious State
Charting on billboards and I still wasn't signed
My homeboys were losing faith, because they were starting to question
If I was as good as we thought, there ain't no return on their investment
Because we all getting older, whatever that means
Guess that means they feel like too old to be having rap dreams
No where to go, I never felt so low, till I got a unexpected call after a show
It was X he was like "Little homie what you doing?", I said "nothing"
He said "I want to let Dre hear your music"
Ain't think nothing of it or what it could potentially be
Long as you heard my music it was good enough for me
I ain't expect nothing, I got off the phone happy
Next day X said Dre wanna meet you out in Cali
How could a boy from Flint ever dream this day was coming
Fuck butterflies I had Eagles in my stomach
We sitting at Katana and I'm tripping like the whole night
Cause this the moment I've been waiting for my whole life
Hit it off instantly, it was a natural chemistry
Went to your crib, I'm ripping every beat you spit for me, you see my potential
And you see what it could be, can't explain what it meant when you said you understood me
Met so many labels and they just didn't get it
Now the greatest telling me I could be the greatest with him
You made sure my deal was straight, and I got what I deserved, even at your own expense
And in this business that's absurd, giving me advice anytime you see me struggle
You inspire me daily how you keep it so humble
And I want to thank you, not just for giving me my turn, and for helping so many people
And not wanting nothing anything in return
