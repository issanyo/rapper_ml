[Verse 1: Jon Connor]
I came up on rap in the era when
Beef got handled in real life, not the internet
And I ain’t sayin I want somebody to get killed
But the shit so fake nowadays it make me wanna throw up on myself
Now see it’s real nigga rap that that shit that they want to be extinct
Now see it’s fake nigga rap they push that ‘cause they don’t want you to think
Rap done got so bad, everybody feel like they could do it too
Niggas dropping these songs, and it’s dropping my IQ
It used to only be niggas, now everybody see it
I feel like they got us getting dumber for a reason

[Sample: CM Punk]
I’m the best
I am the best in the world

[Hook: Jon Connor]
Now see there’s leaders, and there’s followers
But I’d rather be a dick than a swallower
I’d rather have my own mind rather than get caught up in a crowd
Of motherfuckers that lost and only do what they allowed
New Slaves

[Sample: CM Punk]
I am the best in the world
I’m the best

[Verse 2: Jon Connor]
Alright nigga, look
I ain’t no better than you
I watch Real Housewives too
I be watching TMZ
I see the blood on the leaves
I see the blood on the leaves
I see the blood on the leaves
Stevie J and Petey Gunz
I see the blood on the leaves
I was watching Love and Hip-Hop
I was watching Basketball Wives
Knowing that this shit ain’t real life
Knowing that that shit ain’t real life
Knowing that that shit was all film
Knowing that that shit wasn’t real
But the more they showed that shit
The more we acting like them
The more we think it’s ok
They keep the shit on replay
I swear to god I seen the same episode seven times in one day
Somebody tell me I’m wrong
Somebody tell me I’m wrong
But why I rush home to go catch the shit every time it came on?
Hold up, I be watching Maury
Everyday it’s the same old story
Meanwhile, VH1 put more niggas on than Berry Gordy
Hey yo what the fuck is we doing
Meanwhile when we all getting stupid
I just bought an iPhone 5
Technology smarter than the humans
I mean it know where I’m going
Right down to the second I’m moving
Then why these cops can’t catch
All these niggas that be shooting?
That’s ‘cause they don’t want to
That’s until the day they want you
‘Cause while we zombies to these stations they controlling the population

[Sample 2: CM Punk]
I am the best on this microphone, nobody can touch me!
I am the best
I am the best in the world
