[Intro]
Rest in peace to the Notorious B.I.G
Salute to one of the greatest to ever do it
Y'all know me man, people's rapper right
Tell y'all about me

[Verse 1]
Look, it was just me my moms and my sis
In a two bedroom house
Mama slaving at the shop trying to keep food in our mouth
Everyday she came home, I seen the stress on her face
She told me never work a job that I hate
Don't depend on another man on every dollar you make
And don't take a minute for granted every hour is fate
So she sent us to private school, it was about more than education
Was an escape from the hood shit we saw on a daily basis
Needless to say nobody respected that in the hood
I would say that, you go to school, everybody living good
I had a dad, I ain't have a dad cuz he was in and out cuz one day he was cool the next day he was wildin' out
The first time I saw [?] [?] four days car missing now I'm supposed to take pictures, tomorrow at school, heard shots laying in bed
Tell me how I'm supposed to smile with all that shit in my head, for real

[Hook]
I don't want to live no more, sometimes I hear death knocking on my front door
I'm living every day like a hustle, another job to juggle, another day another struggle
I don't want to live no more, sometimes I feel hear death knocking on my front door
I'm living every day like a hustle, another job to juggle, another day another struggle

[Verse 2]
I remember me and my sister running away from home
Moms and pops fist fighting they looked up and we was gone
Just remember momma smiling all the time, trying to be strong, even though we knew what was going on
My household disintegrating and she probably instigating everything we do around the house she getting irritated
Friends coming over every weekend playing cards
A lot of laughing a lot of drinking coming from my front yard
That was just a way to release the stress have a piece of rest because every week she would pray she could leave this mess
Marriage then turn into drama now it's like why even bother
But the problem is she want a son and daughter to have a father
What's even harder is I know my mama got good karma and it seem like I'm the reason that things keep getting darker
It seems that if I ain't say nothing it'll never stop
So imagine the burden having to tell your mom to leave your pops

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
This last verse for my sister when we were ready to cry
We would listen to Biggie this was our favorite joint on Ready to Die
Nobody know my pain like you do because the shit affected you too
And only few knew what we would do was fucking crucial
Criss Cross and Salt n Peppa posters on the wall
Little brother complex always trying to hang with y'all
And I was probably out of here and what you forgot all about in the living room rapping positive [?]
I got it man, put me on to hip-hop, Big Pac
We would connect through our learning lyrics just trying to impress you
2 kids in the ghetto sharing the bedroom, bunkbeds it taught us to never settle
What the fuck can I tell you, see this is a bond never broken by time
And I get a lot of praise for I struggle and I rhyme
But you went through the same thing and survive too
How these people idolize me, I idolize you

[Hook]
