[The Real Slacker]
Yo Connor, let me talk to these fools
Yo man, I heard you working a part time job, thinking you can rap, you're flipping burgers and shit
This is our life, this is what we do 24/7
Besides fucking your bitch..

[Verse 1: Jon Connor]
I cut class on that ass, if you're testing my patience
Niggas say they run shit, they're tripping on their own laces
(I'm so fly, let’s get high)
You're fucking up the rotation
Real recognize real, in any given location
Yeah the flow is so dope, this going right to their nose
Yeah this that George and Diego, I told them I was going to blow
I'm dropping classics, while you motherfuckers dropping the soap
Same niggas was hating, trying to slap five at the show
I'm at the show, packed to the back, wall to wall
You're looking for that real shit, then I'm the nigga to call
Niggas love distance hating, keep their mouth on my ball
I'm from where niggas get the clapping, like a round of applause
I got a nack for this rap shit, don’t you know?
If I done listened to you hater, then we both would be broke
So what type does that make you, you're just provoking me more
I got a room and some condoms and I hope that she knows
It’s going down

[The Real Slacker]
Midnight Society, A-Squad, Blue City Club in this bitch
While you motherfuckers leaving your T-shirts on at pool parties
We're in the back, making hits
It's what we do
Jon Connor, let's go


[Verse 2: Jon Connor]
[?] jets, was the dream of mine
My dad was a motherfucker back in '85
Literally that’s how I got here, I'm one of a kind
And the FLI is the city in which I reside
I'm in the hood fantasying money, Bentleys and Rollies
I'm in the hood surrounded by dealers, killers, parolees
Young niggas get harassed by the police patrollers
Killing's going down but they fucking with me and my homies
Now I'm just minding my business, trying to fuck with some women
I see red and blue lights flashes while I was chilling
Couple niggas with me got cases and some of them [?]
Couple of them got weapons on them that they concealing Average day in the city, you could get fucked on the [?]
You niggas in the foul shit, now you want to run, run
Statistics steady rising, we trying not to become one
Flint is real as it gets and that is why they love us

[The Real Slacker]
Yo, let me break this down
We're like Baseside High, y'all motherfuckers is like Valley (Valley!)
Y'all motherfuckers look like Mr. Tunnel and shit
Let me explain this shit to you
You preppy ass bitch

[Verse 3: Jon Connor]
I don't quit, I'm on my shit
I'm gon' win, niggas hate that though
Y'all going to learn, wait your turn
Everything I say I make it so
I just hit this chick, she told she got a man but he ain't going to know
Oh, you're mad?, shit my bad
Don't hate me, nigga hate your ho
We both rap but it ain’t the same, y'all niggas spit that average flow
I make hits and I ain't gonna miss
How about you take my average ho?
Yes I am that nigga in the spot with Jae, Rich, Have and more
Has it, acid flow I go where all the fattest asses go
Killing every track, like a pro, watch me execute it
Y'all ain't got no hope, the flow is dope, they feeling extra sudent
Think you know?, you have no idea what I got in store
Disappoint them rappers, like them J's that they ain't got in store
Or Varsity Blue City Club the world's greatest music
Put them two fingers and salute us when you see the movement
I'm killing shit, whether I write is, rap it, produce it
Yeah our time is now motherfucker, watch me as I prove it

[The Real Slacker]
I am The Real Slacker
Midnight Society, Jae Holla
We're the cool kids at prom
We're the ones dancing with your chick, finger banging her in the hallway, she's giving us a HJ in the locker room
And you're the kid sitting down
Like damn, I don't think I'm going to get laid tonight
We're "Eifel Towering" that bitch
While you're sitting there like, "man I hope she wants to dance with me"
We're too busy, we're 69ing her
Connor, Salvation
