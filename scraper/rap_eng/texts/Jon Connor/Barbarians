[Intro:Just Blaze]
One, two, one, two and I say...
It's the grand, incredible, imperial, unbeatable Frequency
Mikey Music, yes, the Greek Mystique on the beat
I go by the name of Just Blaze and it goes a little something like this...

[Verse One: Jon Connor]
I spit death to my enemies, they await to awake
I told 'em I was hungry, now they facin' a plate
Digesting these rappers is like I'm tastin' a steak
You niggas is sweet and I'm heated, it's like I'm baking a cake
Gourmet, roast sessions, no guessin' who running the game nigga
Quit askin' the coach questions, so old and I'm home restin'
Niggas try and bug me but I don't notice a roach presence
My pen held by a firearm over these tote weapons
I take this lyrical shit personal like snatchin' my mama's personals
Versatile, got a verse that'll drown you
Have you sleepin' with Ursula, yeah nigga, it's irking you
Like shit, how a nigga that's this cold go and burn the booth?
See, I'm consistent, every verse is convincin'
Keep spittin' bars surrounded by barbed wire fences
Fly city, we stretch money like a gymnast
Jon Connor, one of the greatest when I'm finished, gone

[Verse Two: Laws]
Call me Conan, my girl use both hands
A viking, raise my sword when the boat lands
I over stand how I'm looked at
I saw my destiny in front of me and then I took that
I left my village burnin' up but I never looked back
Now tell me where the puss at, your soul get pushed back
I'm a god of war, kinda sore, look like I hunt dinosaurs
When I fuck a concubine, make her hit all kind of chords
I just murked your whole army and I'm kinda bored
I make you a bitch three times like the commodore
Yeah, legend on the battlefield, product of my environment
Like the kid who has a deal, crack cocaine, a rapper and a teacher
I attack both lanes, take a bath in propane
Light a match, that's the only way to match my flame
So right between your eyes, that's my aim

[Verse Three: Donny Goines]
Rap spartan, street fighter like I (?)
Are you (?) Pardon the acoustics
Black (?) echelon, everyday I set the bar so high
If I nose dive, I will bet a (?) next to (?)
Couldn't catch me if they both tried, uh
You motherfuckers need go in spirit
I.E Ghost Rider, low rider, flow keep 'em bouncing in the hood
40 ounces in my wood, whole English, number dukes
Yellow stone kaiser, so live and just the truth
Expect no silence but I'm a dirty bastard with a verse of admiration
Rain on worthy adversaries, ever heard me crack under pressure?
Never, just to worry, that's the reasons you will never see the world shatter
But I'm groundbreaking, something like Goku 'cause everything is Super Saiyan
All the things you pussies want too, bitch
