[Verse 1 - Jon Connor]
I lost my mind
Every minute is a maze, I’m lost in time
Thoughts collide.
Tell the world he’s a rock, but he’s not because he’s lost his side
A helping hand, how can anybody help when nobody really understand?
Because if they did, they’d know that I was on the air so be ready to catch me when I land. When I land
I didn’t realize I was up so high
Your days, and your weeks, and your months go by
The fail or succeed shit is cut so dry
Wounds don’t heal, pretending like we’re unphased and these wounds ain’t real
Scream so loud but they just don’t hear, and I don’t need both, just give me one ear. Please

[Hook - Jenna Noelle]
Slow down, right now
You’re only dreaming you’ll get out
These broken wings can fly, so I’ll jump out this window
And as a tear escapes my eyes, and flies behind me
I meet my demise with a smile

[Verse 2 - Jon Connor]
Nights is sleepless
Wanna live a shallow life, so we write this deep shit
How we living it ain’t right, but we live it every night, take a 9/11 flight off the deep end
Caged inside my thought, I don’t think I can spend another night in the precinct
I ain’t gonna lie, I wanted peace of mind, but it feeling like my mind’s in pieces. Mind’s in pieces
Doctors, lawyers, actors, teachers
Friends, family, liars, leeches
Preachers’ speeches still can’t reach us
Rich, poor, we’re all just creatures
Money talks, the poor is speechless
Followers, leaders, lies, secrets
Angels, demons, sleepless dreamers.

[Hook - Jenna Noelle]
Slow down, right now
You’re only dreaming you’ll get out
These broken wings can fly, so I’ll jump out this window
And as a tear escapes my eyes, and flies behind me
I meet my demise with a smile

[Verse 3 - Jon Connor]
In the beginning, we chase a feeling that’s only gonna last for a minute
But want it [?] we’ll do anything just to get it
Timid, but we’re driven, so we push it to the limit
Limitations only hinder us from winning
Can’t lose, but really we lost. I paid dues that came at a cost
Yeah me and God, we can have these talks, but shit only I can bear this cross
Just me and my thoughts; then the walls start talking
They say that people like me don’t make it too often
Chasing my dream was [?] died of exhaustion
But for my dream I would gladly lie in a coffin
If I die before I wake; I’ve been through hell, I already know the way
So take my soul if I have a soul to take, so every night I pray that I just won’t break

[Bridge - Jenna Noelle]
I keep losing my head
I keep losing my head
I keep losing my head
Now I’m losing the ground
I keep losing my head
I keep losing my head
I keep losing my head
Now I’m losing the ground

Before you know it, your days are gone, wait for me
Surrounded I’m living my days alone, alone, alone
I’m fading out, I don’t know how to save me from the mull inside my head
Just save me from the hell inside my head
I can not rest, I won’t be found, I’ll take it all to the ground

[Hook - Jenna Noelle]
Slow down, right now
You’re only dreaming you’ll get out
These broken wings can fly, so I’ll jump out this window
And as a tear escapes my eyes, and flies behind me
I meet my demise with a smile
