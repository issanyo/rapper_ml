[Verse 1]
This affliction turned to an addiction
Every night my girl was tied
I was fucking round with Jasmine Cashmere, Pinky, Jada Fire
I was hooked on Cherokee cause that ass was one of a kind
Started back in seventh grade was my reason to stay inside
Moms was gone, nobody home
Fuck it, I turned up the sound
Set Wesley Pipes doing all this talking
Now I gotta turn the volume down
Woosies try to seduce me, forgive me, I must warn y'all
Please don't fuck with me less you gon fuck me like a porn star
Redtube, Xtube, Pornhub, Tubegalore
I use these shits to tutor hoes
Show them what they doing wrong
Don't know how to talk to yo chick?
My nigga, just use this song
I say, no girl can do it like a porn star
I'm waiting for one of these chicks to prove me wrong

[Hook]
It's four in the morning, in the morning
You ain't gotta say a word
I'm horny, I'm on ya
Time to still enjoy this, still up on it, still up on it, ay ay
But I only wanna hear you say yay, yay, yay

[Bridge]
What about my Jada Fire, Velvet Rose, Alicia Tyler
Misty Stone, Kinky, Dominique Simone
Lord, I love these hoes
Lord knows I love these hoes
Lord knows I love these hoes

[Verse 2]
Look, white girls got me on bankroll shit
Hotel looking like a Bangbros flick
We in a different city, but the same old shit
Get em in, get em out, change clothes quick
Old school hoes like Melissa Derio
Take em out now, let me fill them if they real
My little rich chick got a house from the hills
First she poppin ass and now she pop pills
Worldwide now, so I can't sit still
Yeah, I see how they get down in Brazil
Drop it to the floor girl, put it right here
Little onion booty make a nigga shed tears
In the meanwhile, while I kill a freestyle
Take an intermission make you look like a priest now
Your honor, angel, porno, goddess, fly, city, stroke a, honest
Hit it from the back, we did it in the back seat
Took her to the telly for a little Jenna jackmeat
They be telling me to get it, now I got a rap sheet
Do it like Naomi, bend her on her ass cheek
Then she look like Michelle Tucker, I'm gon fuck her with no rubber
It's lights out, and no cover. All night, she gon love it

[Hook]
It's four in the morning, in the morning
You ain't gotta say a word
I'm horny, I'm on ya
Time to still enjoy this, still up on it, still up on it, ay ay
But I only wanna hear you say yay, yay, yay

[Bridge]
What about my Jada Five, Velvet Rose, Alicia Tyler, Misses Stone, Kinky Dominique Simone. Lord, I love these hoes. Lord knows I love these hoes. Lord knows I love these hoes
