Y’all really think I give a fuck ‘bout half the shit y’all say
Been dodging hate since I was 8, I could do this shit all day
Wanna kick my feet up but the lease up so I’m out this bitch
Soon as that day come when everybody around me rich
Selfish intentions, selfish motives attracted by yourself
And when it don’t be you that mean you gotta watch everybody else
But that’s exhausting, I chose the latter, I just don’t fuck with y’all
So consequently, when I be down I don’t know who the fuck to call
Just give me a minute, don’t own the key to success
Yea, I got this from Cosby
But I know the key to failure is when you try to please everybody
I write this shit to keep you personal
So just keep on playing this song until your stress is gone
I’ll be a shrink to your problems, a shrink ‘til they become extinct
My cousin gone, do I lose sleep over haters?
What the fuck you think? Hell nah
I don’t know what to tell y’all
Except that you create your own destiny
And my passion will never fail y’all
Well yo I’d tell livin’ swell y’all
But I’d be lying if I ain’t sayin’ I went through hell y’all
My tails of fighting demons in brimstone compels all
But I tell the ugly truth about the hood and hopes that it repels y’all
I hope that y’all don’t get the wrong impression of me
I swear I’m trying to use discretion with this aggression homie
What do people want to know my music is to truly know me
My middle finger is reserved for the fake and phony
It is what it is and as long as I’m my mama’s son
I’mma chase my dreams so you
Ain’t gotta count down how long I run
Shit, the eternal yard dash in the finish line
It’s in his mind and I know winning is not far away
But the beginning is trying harder bullshit in this rap game, fuck it
I’mma eat that just as long as
I give that real shit to all my people who need that
And fuck yea I’mma lash out
Without a go never back out
As hard as y’all know that I’mma shine
I guess I just had to blackout, Blackout
