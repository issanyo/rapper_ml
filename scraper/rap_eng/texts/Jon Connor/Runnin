[Intro: The Notorious B.I.G.] (x2)
I grew up a fuckin' screw up
Got introduced to the game
Got a ounce and fucking blew up
Chopping rocks over night
The nigga Biggie Smalls
Tryna turn into the black Frank White

[Verse 1: Jon Connor]
I do this for the nigga in the basement
Just chasing his dream
Chasing what he perceives is making it
But it ain't what it seems
So far gone he done lost sight of what making it mean
Can't talk about music with his folks without making a scene
Ya he try to ignore his problems
But look at how far that got him
No matter how hard he work
He still looking up at the bottom
Nobody seeing his vision
His girl is saying he tripping
And he become more distant
Encouragement non-existant
He cursed with being persistent
He hurt but nobody listen
Hard work ain't making a difference
At least thats how we be feeling
Late night while his niggas hitting bitches
He be spitting lyrics ain't been himself
He don't recognize the nigga in the mirror
Spirit tell him to keep going
But comin, damn close to quitting
But he know that it ain't, over till he finished
And he about to have a melt down
The only thing that stop him
Is he dont wanna let his self
Or nobody else down
We Run It!

[Hook]
Why am I fighting to live, if I'm just living to fight?
Why am I trying to see, when there ain't nothing in sight?
Why am I trying to give, when no one gives me a try?
Why am I dying to live, if I'm just living to die?


[Verse 2: Jon Connor]
I do this for the sleepless nights
You ain't eaten right
Born to die that shit might be tonight
Give me a cig' my nigga i need a light
Your girl wanna spend time
But you like i need to write
She got too much time she need a life
If she can't see the light
Every night you stressing and second guessing
You question if this a blessing
Depressed because results is not adding
Up to what you invested
It's nothing like you expected
It's brutal but you accept it
You lose the connection
To folks that usually you respected
Cause everybody's got suggestions
On whats the right path
Lost motherfuckers tryna direct your life path
The fuck out of here
That ain't sensible
How you gon' tell me how to be happy
When you miserable
You the one that gotta live your life
Wether good or bad
Take the wrong advise
And you'll be reminiscing
On what you coulda had
Just keep going dawg and
Know your day is coming
Get up and keep on running
All this ain't for nothing
For real
