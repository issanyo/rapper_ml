[Verse: Jon Connor]
I took a little time out to find myself
(If it) Wasn't for music, I probably wouldn't know how to define myself
Seek and you shall find when you try to hide yourself
From yourself, and I ended up by myself
Hurt, but I couldn't deny myself
Thinking of all the days I was on my own
Lost in this cold ass world just tryna find my way home
But where's home if I left would anybody even notice I'm gone?
There's something wrong cos the more good I do the more evil I'm shown
Hoping somebody that love me on the other end of my phone
All I think of when I wake up
And when you tryna do good, people waiting for the day you break up
Hold up, it's hard enough tryna stay positive when you keep reaching for a goal you can't touch
Anytime you fall, you get up
Every day you feel like breaking down, it's too much
Every day you give your all but your all ain't enough
I get excited when I feel like this
I've been fighting the odds since I was little and I'm still like this
Suffering builds character, so imagine my life to have will like this
Been to Hell and back and I still won't quit
Y'all gotta feel that shit
Had to lose, pay dues, till I learned my worth
Before you can save the world, you gotta save you first
If that's the path you choose
You just gotta know before it gets better it's gonna get worse
That's the path that was set from birth
I know it get hard taking all this hurt
But just don't quit (Don't quit)
But just don't quit...
