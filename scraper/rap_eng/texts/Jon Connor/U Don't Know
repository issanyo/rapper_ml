[Verse 1: Jon Connor]
My thought process probably to much to process
Toxic when I spit that hot-shit
They gossip when they hear me drop shit
Problem is god sent Jon to bring the conscious to all this nonsense
Street smart and my knowledge is a master degree in college
I've seen them drop out, every punchline is a knockout
My bars will raise the dead, my next show I'm gonna bring Biggie and Pac out
The flow will choke rappers up, like when Mankind bring that sock out
And I don't give a fuck running in a cops house with my cock out
Around here we let them hoes fight, and be hoping a titty pop out
I'm a savage, my throne is in the kingdom of the madness
The people are drawn to me
Can you imagine a magnet the size of a skyscraper
I be killing every verse, drive them off in a hearse, put them in the dirt
Now they close to mama nature, I bet your mama hates you
Son of a bitch, spitting dope, its numbing my lips, while the people loving my shit
Sav told me "put out a hit", its like he put out a hit
Dump a clip from killing MCs, every since I ain't never missed, look
Mo Cleaves, I think I got them convinced
I spit a rap out, then they tap out, watch me make them submit
My bars hard as fuck, its like they made of cement
Niggas fall off, the cars and broads is enough to make them content, but not me
I need a monopoly on the game that had me shopping in Paris
While the paparazzi watch me, watch me
Like the lookout before you rappers get took out
They can't read me, they waiting for me to put a book out
I eat beats, I'm inviting you to the cookout
I'm from if a nigga grill you, he's here to kill you
On the road to success, and the bullshits in my rear view
The flow is god's gift, you listening to a miracle
The reason I dominate, is because I don't find time to hate
To the niggas that do, they need to hide they face and hibernate
This is a warning to anybody who's still snoring
I'm the worst nightmare, that will still be there in the morning, Connor
