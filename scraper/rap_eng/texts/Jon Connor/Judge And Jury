[Intro]

[Verse 1: Jon Connor]
Started as a child
I just wanna make my momma and my grandma proud
Never would have envisioned that the scribbles that I was writing
In my kitchen would eventually catch up with me now
Meaning, I done been through hell, saw my friends turn to demons transformed
Wouldn't have believed it if i hadn't see it
Niggas say they love you long as love mean manipulation
Jealousy of Jon Connor make them hate Jon Freeman
What am I to do when it's them not me that can't separate the two
When everyone changing making plans for when you famous
And everybody saying boy you better stay you
I better stay me shit you better stay you
I ain't ever had a problem with the person in the mirror
Now my grandma gone and I still kept going
Got nerve saying Connor don't lose your soul
Like I need a fucking reason

[Hook: Jon Connor]
Hol' up I do'nt need a reason
It go hard on these rap niggas I don't need a reason
It go hard on these wack niggas I don't need a reason
Lose my mind nigga I don't need a reason
Lose my mind nigga don't give me a reason
It go hard on these rap niggas don't give me a reason
It go hard on these wack niggas don't give me a reason
Kill your favourite rap nigga don't give me a reason

Is it fair?
I done got up
I done pay dues
Made a living
At not giving a fuck
I'd have been broke on my ass and I don't give up
Gave my all when it seemed my all ain't enough
I don't need a reason
Hol' up, I don't need a reason
It go hard on these rap niggas don't give me a reason
It go hard on these wack niggas don't give me a reason
Kill your favourite rap nigga I don't need a reason

[Verse 2: Jon Connor]
Look, D Monny homicide still kept rapping
Best friend suicide still kept rapping
Lil' cousin car crash they don't know what happen
So how you motherfuckers gonna tell me about passion
How you gonna tell me what should motivate me
When my motive for doing music always motivate me daily
When i look around and I don't see nobody that was there from the beginning
In my room crying like a fucking baby
Do you know what that feel like?
All this shit that I'm saying is my real life
Got stabbed in the back and don't know how to act
Cos my war wounds ain't heal right
I gotta answer to god I don't answer to y'all
Fuck niggas specially niggas hating on blogs
Fuck a magazine fuck a review
Like a need an excuse to do what I gotta do
Nigga I don't need a motherfucking reason

[Hook]
Hol' up I don't need a reason
It go hard on these rap niggas I don't need a reason
It go hard on these wack niggas I don't need a reason
Lose my mind nigga I don't need a reason
Lose my mind nigga don't give me a reason
It go hard on these rap niggas don't give me a reason
It go hard on these wack niggas don't give me a reason
Kill your favourite rap nigga don't give me a reason

[Verse 3: Jon Connor]
Performing in, hole in the walls
With bullet holes in the walls
Don't know if I'll make it clapped or get a round of applause
I'm in the club hood niggas looking at me funny like he ain't a trap nigga
But they can see he was hungry huh?, ain't sleeping ain't eating
Ain't doing a goddamn thing but my thing
Hol' up real nigga I'll remind them of the nineties
April 1985 my spirit jumping out of my body oh shit
Every night I'm down on my knees
Every night I'm saying god please
Help me to warn these niggas
If they ever question my drive they don't really know me
Been through more than a nigga could imagine
Pissing on a nigga would never get a reaction
They was pissing on a nigga but they wasn't even a distraction
The time I spend on haters they don't add up to a fraction, gone!

[Hook]
Hol' up I don't need a reason
It go hard on these rap niggas
It go hard on these wack niggas I don't need a reason
I don't need a reason
Lose my mind nigga
It go hard on these rap niggas don't give me a reason
It go hard on these wack niggas don't give me a reason
Kill your favourite rap nigga don't give me a reason
