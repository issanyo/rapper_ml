[Intro: DJ Khaled]
Ayo, Flint Michigan, stand up
DJ Khaled

[Verse 1: Jon Connor]
Armed and dangerous
I guess you could say I was made for this
Y'all don't know all the bullshit I came against
Niggas came on in, found out niggas work with [?]
Gotta probably be the only thing that I gave up
Niggas love it when you standing at the bottom
Ain't a problem when you falling
But they hate you on the way up - hold up
Friends, foes, money, shows
Highs, lows, eyes closed
Niggas told me "bros before hoes"
What about when your bros are actin' like hoes?

Gotta pay dues, I'm sleeping on floors
In the studio, seven days in the same clothes

But they ain't got the same soul

I did wrong but I payed for
If I'd came in the game for the fame
Trynna teach niggas, but how you gonna reach niggas?
When they brain on a leach, nigga?

Look mom it's a moment
I know where I'm going
I'm loaded, I cock it, explode it
Just trynna make history, picture me rollin
A flow that's gon' keep the whole industry floating
And I ain't saying I'm the new 'Pac
Just sayin' ain't nobody spit this much real shit since 2pac, or Big
But through shit like this I make sure they still is

[Verse 2: Mickey Wallace]
It's fucked up when your best friend turn into a fiend
And he scheme for your cream
Thought he was on your team, but he in it for the green

That's why I be up on my grind

Patiently waiting but now is my time
Smoking that reefa to ease my pain,re

Better think twice, my niggas do not play
See the FLY city and
