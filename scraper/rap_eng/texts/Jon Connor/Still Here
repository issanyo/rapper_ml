(Hook)
They want me gone but I'm still here
I'm in this bitch like I live here
So they keep on calling me back
That's why I'm still here
I'm in this bitch like I live here
That's why I'm still here
And everywhere that I go
They hold me now cause they know
I'm always with 'em
So they keep on calling me back
That's why I'm still here
I'm in this bitch like I live here

(Verse 1)
I feel like I'm the only rapper that's still real
That would give a handshake to his fan and
So say thank you, ain't nothing grateful
This road to take you through shit that will test your will
In a time when they respect meals instead of skills
But a deal don't make you real
They say it's just music ,it's just stupid
Think about how many hours we listen to it
So I embrace my influence
I knew this shit as an adolescent
When I was a freshman
Before my girl was the freshest
I was writing rhymes and failing tests'
So picture that teachers gave up on me this shit was heavy
They never figured that I knew what I wanted to do already
I'm sitting there writing rhymes they like, Jon don't waste your mind
They had my feeling like this rap shit was a waste of time
I feel like who gon' stop me, can't see my vision, watch me
They say only one in a million, well I feel like one now
Me, it ain't shit that I can't have, and a star that I can't grab
Last ones always end up first, first one always end up last

(Hook)
So I'm still here
I'm in this bitch like I live here
So they keep on calling me back
That's why I'm still here
I'm in this bitch like I live here
The people keep on calling me back
So everywhere that I go
They hold me now cause they know
I'm always with 'em
So they keep on calling me back
That's why I'm still here
I'm in this bitch like I live here
And they keep on calling me back

(Verse 2)
What you supposed to do
When they approaching you like go to school
And you get emotional cause nobody close to you
Know what you going through
A dream chase is a dream catch but the people lazy
Instead of encouraging you they rather say you crazy
But what's insane to me it's when
Peope don't listen to young people that's gifted
And say they dream ain't realistic
And they end up settling
Yeah they had a chance but they missed it
They got a life and they hate it
Tryin' to meet your expectations
They can't be you they can only be them
The problem is how much they care about they way you see them
They keep on trying to reach you that's why you can't teach them
All you gotta do is listen you ain't gotta read them
All the pressure and the way they tryin'
To make explanations about why we ain't live up to expectations
I know you expecting greatness but
Allow me to tell you the truth
Great is when you master doing you
For real, let's go

(Hook)
So I'm still here
I'm in this bitch like I live here
So they keep on calling me back
That's why I'm still here
I'm in this bitch like I live here
The people keep on calling me back
So everywhere that I go
They hold me now cause they know
I'm always with 'em
So they keep on calling me back
That's why I'm still here
I'm in this bitch like I live here
And they keep on calling me back

(Verse 3)
I played the underdog but
What's enough what's shit get tough
They steady digging for the best
You get this diamond in a rough
I never wanted recognition
Nothing handed nor given
Feel like God never answer
And the devil is submissive
Shit ain't instant so following dreams seems so prolific
When the cops made me mad at a house I knew I get it
Everyday the thought of niggers looking stupid is my vengeance
And this tension is mistaken to be bitter but it's iller cause
Mama told me college was my ship to the stars
And class thinking damn 16 credits of these bars
Contemplation in conversations of who gon' make it turn up
God damn congratulations my saving graces if I quit
Then I'm proving all these theories that they stare me cause I flow
On my feet, getting weary hope you hear me and
Love turned to hate,and this dilly getting near me
I won't make a compromise
So these niggers can't let me motherfucker

(Hook)
So I'm still here
I'm in this bitch like I live here
So they keep on calling me back
That's why I'm still here
I'm in this bitch like I live here
The people keep on calling me back
So everywhere that I go
They hold me now cause they know
I'm always with 'em
So they keep on calling me back
That's why I'm still here
I'm in this bitch like I live here
And they keep on calling me back

(Outro)
I made this shit
For you,you,you
Don't get it twisted
Every time I write a rhyme
That shit for you,you,you
I know you hear me
If you feel me
Snow I made that shit
For you,you,you
Don't get it twisted
Everytime you hear my voice
That's shit for you, you, you
