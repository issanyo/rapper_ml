Nah it’s the same bullshit from the other night
Just came home, you already stressing
I can’t do shit right
Got 35 motherfucking questions, before I get off my flight
It won’t stop till she get the title, she love to fight
And now she bring up the bitches way back from past years
Like when she found naked text messages last year
Asking me who I love when she the one laying here
Maybe I’m crazy because I’m the one who staying here
Here we go again, shit I could have sworn to the lord
We made amends
But you made a fence that I had to climb,thanks to your hater friends
Saying we was good for good
But I guess that all depends
On which day of the week she feel like she can’t pretend
It get confusing, every night she holler how she need me
Come off the road say I ain’t fuck no ho, she don’t believe me
Guess I was greedy, for trying to have my cake and eat it
We prolong, how long before one of us end up leaving
Well god damn

We keep going round and round, and round X 4
And around we go

She be like boy you ain’t never got no time
But I be like just cause I ain’t caught on me you ain’t on my mind
Yeah I send the text messages from time to time
A couple lol’s a smily face, I figured she’ll be fine
Cause yo she close to understanding I be on my grind
Girl don’t say nothing shit I’m working, to stay in line
But how that work with no relationship ain’t been defined
But I found that one day she’ll get tired, that’s just how the game designed
I got attached, hoping you be the exception
And now I’m jumping bed to bed trying to find the connection
And now I’m reaching on the dresser to find a protection
Now I’m just like you, I settle for any affection
You keep on giving but it’s like you ain’t getting it from me
Feel like God blessed me but he cursed you to love me
See, I be saying that is best for you to leave me
But I keep on saying don’t go I ain’t making this easy

We keep going round and round, and round X 4
And around we go

So tell me what it is, I know I’m wrong, I know I’m selfish
I can’t help it, can’t stand the thought of you being someone else’s
I swear I’m ready to be done with all this shit
Guess both of us can’t face the hurt the truly call it quits
I’m asking you how long is me and you gonna have it out
Instead of being the adults and walking away we fucking drag it out
Living it now be-cause we holding on the history
We can’t let go, feel like we holding on the misery
We both conflicted so, tell me what is more to do
I’m wanting you boo but we caught up in the catch 22
Cause if I ever get up enough next to say we through
I know every chick has to gon' to live up to you
Look, we keep complaining but ain’t nobody changing
Only thing that changing is our feelings and the way we say it
But look, I wish you well even if it’s not with me
When you fall in love, the only thing you hope is to land on your feet

We keep going round and round, and round X 4
And around we go
