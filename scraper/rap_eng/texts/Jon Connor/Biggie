(Justin Day, best in the world!)

[Verse 1: Justin Day]
You think success for you
Is the failures of other people
If that’s your point of view
Nigga, we not considered equal
I’m claustrophobic; it’s hard to function in crowded places
See haters come in the form of kindness and smiling faces
I’m just trying to preserve the genre
Basically, patiently waiting for the return of karma, so pray for me
(You know what it is!)
Far from a modern martyr, I write it good enough
That’s what a lot of them call me, often
Choose not to be so friendly with some, cuz them niggas talking
Niggas is plotting, scheming and planning to pick your coffin
Used to be unified in the days of the picking cotton
Pick of the litter to get up out of them litter boxes
Wish me the best, journey to my success
Music to me is therapeutic, relieving my stress
You can be what you want to be, like mama told ya
Or you can be on your corner dealing your marijuana

[Verse 2: Mickey Wallace]
Yeah
I giving them home whether or not they praying it
Wallace bring ‘em that get ‘em shit
Ornery since a youngin now hunger from never having shit
Realist out to 2-3-1, that’s no embellishing
Staying true to my core and fuckin’ up records for betterment
God, I’m so serious
Please somebody help me to murder these dummy rappers and bury a couple weapons
Been seeing ‘em half stepping, so timing was of the essence
This plot was planned and perfected, Blu City Club’s been elected
Yeah, yeah
Thank God for finally noticing bodies piling up
Time is up, not admitting; it’s clinching on your esophagus
Stopping us, no it’s next to impossible
Kid’s brother, his name is never going to happen
I swear that’s word to your mother
Who governs the rap industry, shit we letting in sickens me
Poppas claiming they kings, but can’t balance the power mentally
Finna be all you talk about, we been ready to reign
I’m crazy enough to run it, blessed is in the name

[Verse 3:  Jon Connor]
Night vision I never blink and do things that you never seen
Been that nigga since seventeen and at seven I met a fiend
And I knew I better do better expected to never leave
Every night we saw niggas fighting
Bush Reed and Apollo Creed
I’m up now while you sound asleep
All I hear is the sound of feet
That’s success running through my head
So I drowned it out with a beat
This hunger so when I eat
Gain a thousand pounds in a week
And you niggas sounding like clowns
So my voice is sounding relief
You wanna get grounded
My teeth just a bloodhound on a sheet
From when clowns get found in the street
Nigga duck down in your seat
You niggas out of yo mind and my level’s out of yo reach
You niggas are a dime a dozen
Like trying to find a towel on the beach
And you will drown cuz its deep
I don’t practice, I master what I preach
I swear to God or may He strike me down in my sleep
I’m a give you me until there ain’t none
I’m a legend in the making, shit you can’t tell me that I ain’t one
