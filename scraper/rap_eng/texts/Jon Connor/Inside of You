[Hook] x4
I long to be
Is it wrong to be
Inside of you

[Verse 1: Jon Connor]

Yeah I've been watching you
Since you let BIG and Pac in you
White boys Eminem, Kid Rock in you
And now I wanna be on top of you
I ain't never think you'd fuck with me
Who'd a knew you'd end up loving me
Fuck girls and guys
Got my eyes on the prize
I'mma change lives when you done with me
I know that she love my type
Going raw every time I write
Through the week I can't sleep
Thoughts of you keep me up at night
You will bring a life that all us want all us try
But all us don't make it to the promised land
Cause I done seen it leave ballers broke
Niggas that think they hot
Got that fire be gone in a cloud of smoke
And when they be too needy, too greedy
She will make niggas choke
Playing mind games
Think you got here but you ain't even close
I might be going crazy
Cause for this bitch I would do the most
Damn it I

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Jon Connor]

Yeah I was told you never gone get that
She might flirt but you never gone hit that
Ya'll too mismatched
From the go all she wanna know
Is boy where them hits at
As I penetrate she want a nigga that innovate
For this ho I went down them roads
Months on end I was riding up and down interstates
Do it for the nights I ain't sleep
Do it for the nights that I ain't eat
Do it for the nights she use to tease me
Watching all these niggas on MTV
Been along time since you let a nigga from Fli
Get inside of you
You let me fuck, now I'm stuck
Honey I could never say bye to you
And girl you could never say bye to me
Or the passion inside of me
They could never take that out of me
I'm everything that they try to be
Girl you gone be the reason til the day I stop breathin'
Stronger than any drugs
Somebody help me she got me fiending

[Hook]

[Bridge: Infant Sorrow Sample]

Old as ancient skies
I've had these wandering eyes
But you took me by surprise
When you let me inside of you
Inside of you
Inside of you
I long to be
Is it wrong to be
Inside of you

[Hook]
