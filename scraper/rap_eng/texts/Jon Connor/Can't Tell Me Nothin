[Verse 1]
Yeah
All I saw was drama shit, I put that on my mama
In this water, I done seen Nemo turned to a piranha
17, she just a baby turned into a baby mama
Shorty turned into a thug, cause that's all that was around him
Shit like cowboys and Indians, Billy Gunn vs. Tatanka
Niggas fighting in the street, look like Ryu versus Blanka
Nigga can't get no sleep, just heard 7 shots and counting
Nigga stay high as hell, like they just landed on a mountain
We was out here, 7th grade, talking bout' we bout' it, bout' it
Guns like an American Express, don't leave home without it
We get nervous to get crowded, niggas wildin'
Nigga got me, Imma get him back, it's childish
Push a wig back like a stylist
Old problems resurfaced, they'll kill you off nostalgia
If you be too extra, extra, we'll be reading all aboutcha'
Use to the bullshit and that's why most people stay scared of change
Might move to Atlanta if you're brave

[Hook]
La, la, la la
Wait 'til I get my money right
La, la, la la
Then you can't tell me nothing, right?
Excuse me, was you saying something?
Nah ah, you can't tell me nothing
Uh uh, you can't tell me nothing
Nah, you can't tell me nothing

[Verse 2]
I had a dream i'd be living like a king
On my Malcolm X shit, get this shit by any means
I just wanna ball hard like I gotta couple rings
But it seems my enemies is playing for the same team
Life a movie, they keep shooting, but nah, they ain't shooting scenes
Closer I get to a million, more I miss my granny dreams, damn
With a track that's legendary, I'm tryna' be on the top of that
Any track that I hop on, i'm hot on that
Shit, I came from the hood, I will not go back
I will not be that mahfucka' with a sad story
Can't ignore me, got it locked like I got the door key
Horny, fuck the world, let me turn this bitch to an orgy
Use to be at the crib, dreaming bout' getting it on
Shit, i'm so close and I know it
Spirit was bending but it never broken
Now i'm watching you, watch me enter my moment
I'm focused, I just go get what I want
Ho niggas on ho shit
Ironic, the ones that talk the most be the niggas that really don't know shit
Ironic, the scariest niggas be the ones talking the most shit
My nigga, that's just game, so be careful who you roll with

[Hook: x2]
