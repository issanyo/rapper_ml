[Verse 1: Phreshy Duzit]
I'm trying to get my motherfucking stunt on
She rather get her love on, I rather get my nut off
That's why we often on, "I'm on to other things"
Im fond of honesty, but this love is costing me
Uh! It don't make sense, it don't make sense
I'm trynna live it up and it don't make way
I might have awarded a wrong, but you know what I meant
If i'mma gamble my love and lose you then be it
Money [?], falling in debt
I did you wrong and way of karma, I'm next
Stress kills even when I'm dead still
I'm ghost, unfroze, been numb, can't feel
Still got your heart on your sleeves?
And mine's almost splattered on the floor
You ain't asking for much, and I keep asking for more

[Hook: Phreshy Duzit] (2x)
Cause I can't stop, a nigga need more (Wake up)
That's why I stay high.. balance my lows (Get up)

[Verse 2: Jon Connor]
To tell the truth, the booth is more of a confession though
This life is full of vices but we try to stay professional
But we around masters and deception
The exceptional like converting, diverting, I get from what it was destined for
Professional backstabbers, professional gold diggers
When we ain't got self control, this shit easy control niggas
I had a girl, I figured she'd be the exception
But we lost connection, when this rap shit became an obsession
She had a question, where is my priority?
She wanted more of me, always supported me
But morally, it was the whore of me
Cause half the time these girls adoring me
The other half of the time somebody recording me, this shit absorbing me
Now we don't seem as close, but my dream is close
But when she give you the ultimatum that's when you see what mean the most
And I ain't here to say which choice is right or wrong
But all she had to do was right, and I had to write this song
Cause..
