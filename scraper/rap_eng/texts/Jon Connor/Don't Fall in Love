[Verse 1]
I am not these niggas you compare me to, can't do what a square do
No, I do not love you, Hell no, I ain't gon' marry you
Tryna run that game but a real nigga scarin' you
Fuck you think I'm stupid? I know all these niggas sharin' you
Fall in head first, when I was young I learned my lesson
Nigga, don't ignore that feeling if she got you second guessing
You wonder what she doin', every minute, every second
You keep callin' (callin), and gettin' a voice message
Make you question why you fucking with her, she fucking another nigga
You fucked on the first night? So did that other nigga
And no nigga, don't treat the pussy like a prize
These hoes can expose that you a pussy in disguise
So you thinkin' you gon' rescue her
News flash; she laughing at that ass while this nigga layin' next to her
He shakin' his head every time you send a text to her
Don't play yourself homeboy, it's just sex to her
(yea it is)

[Hook]
Don't fall in love with a bitch
They take what they can, at every fucking cost
At any risk or any loss
Don't fall in love with a bitch
They take what they can, at every fucking cost
That's why you niggas end up lost

[Verse 2]
Look I'm speaking from experience, so you don't have to
I used to save these hoes, go to the crib, and get the bat suit
Got the run around so much, I shoulda wore a track suit
Niggas tellin' me that ain't the bitch to get attached to
Shit, I done seen niggas go crazy for these hoes
Try to trap em, bustin' in em, having babies by these hoes
They trapped in the moment, while she fuckin', giving head
The truth get exposed, now it's fucking with his head
Make me sick to my stomach cause you missin' that bitch
She just sucked my dick and now you kissin' that bitch
The homies know the deal, we all dissin' that bitch
Riding strapped with this nigga, steady quittin' that bitch
Go run your game cause I'm up on it
I told em she was mine for tonight
And now she his for the moment
In my bed last night, now she's in here for the morning
I pimped your game out it

[Hook]
Don't fall in love with a bitch
They take what they can, at every fucking cost
At any risk or any loss
Don't fall in love with a bitch
They take what they can, at every fucking cost
That's why you niggas end up lost
Don't fall in love with a bitch
