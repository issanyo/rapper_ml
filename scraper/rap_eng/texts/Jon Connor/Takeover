[Verse 1]
I am Jon Connor
Hip Hop's karma
Back to show you the difference between artists and niggas playing with markers
I am holding that heat
And these niggas playing with sparklers
Planted the seed of doubt
Now you're starting to witness the harvest
Look you from a garden I'm from the jungle
Where cops is guarding the target
Cause it could go down in a supermarket
Get murked in the shoe department
No clues because the boys in blue
Would never get news from dudes who knew when the shooting started
Best in the world
Sick, just give me a second to hurl
Put my all in this music
Whatever's left I put in your girl
Pitiful niggas ain't worth the lid that's under my genitals
Mowin kindle to generals you can't stop the agenda
Niggas sweeter than ginger
Dead meat, you niggas tender
Shaking the game up
I throw all you fruits in the blender
Blue City Club not only the president, I'm a member
Cause at the end of the day we the only thing they remember cause...

[Verse 2]
Nah, Look
Nobody scare me
So don't you ever compare me
To these Luke Perrys
I'll bury or escape with their lives barely
You dare me? Or double-dog dare me?
My mind is as sharp as a claw
Take a saw to the jaw ready?
You giving up all ready?!
Cause this is childs play
Murder beats and all they found is a doll in the aisleway
With obvious signs of foul play
The people's poetry you want sick?
Well wait 'till you get a load of me
My coldest show at most won't even stand close to me
Punch lines 'till my shoulder's weak
Then put 'em in the Texas cloverleaf
I'm in this fight with drunk fists and sober feet
Took over locally
Fucking bitches like Jodeci
Now I need the whole globe to see
That's what the game been knowing me
Lord forgive me
But they ain't give me nothing so I took it
And wasn't nobody looking
Plus look at the work I put in
Look, Y'all better act afraid
I'm coming for all of my accolades
Connor of time bomb you
Time's up watch me act a fake

[Verse 3]
Nah, Look
I don't fear y'all
Cause I hear me, and I hear y'all
When I'm near y'all it's so quiet you could hear a tear fall
Look I'm drunk on power this is beer pong with Smirnov
Take a year off
It's severe like Tyson biting Holyfield's ear off
Look, This ain't a fair fight
This a gun and a chair fight
You a bum in a bear fight
What is there to compare right?
Shining you call the glare right
When I leave it's 'gon be only darkness
Fresh 'till death I'm a walking martyr
You numbers like Tony Parker
I take advantage from Michigan out to Dallas
If Miami's where I take my talents
I'm destined to be a champion
The damage I do 'gon need more than a bandage
I make hot shit
My hand'll randomly grand 'em
I went from ugly to handsome
I step on the stage, now all I hear is cheers
I'm tear dancing
You beggin for your life to the ears of Charles Manson
I tried to be nice
Now I'm pissed like you lied to me twice
I'm fire and ice until I retire the mic because
