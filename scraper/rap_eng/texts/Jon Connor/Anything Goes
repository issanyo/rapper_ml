[Chorus]
It's just one of them nights, where anything goes
Got a whole lot of shine, a lil somethin' to smoke
Bonfire so high, you could see it from the road
Got somethin' real fine, tryn' to pull her real close

It's just one of them nights, where anything goes
Got a whole lot of shine, a lil somethin' to smoke
Bonfire so high, you could see it from the road
Got somethin' real fine, tryn' to pull her real close

[Verse 1]
It's just one of them nights, after one of those days
Pushing through a double shift cause I gots to get paid
I'ma take it to the crib, maybe catch a warm plate
'Ol lady hot and heavy and I know she wanna play
But my cell phones buggn'
My crew's on a mission for the back road business
Hold a gal and poured a sip and fire up the 'ol Chevy stick of pine
In the wind, dirt dirt road swerving tryn' to catch my third wind
Bonfire meetin', cash for the cab
Blue flame whisky on that home grown pine
Load a couple cases make a toast to our kin
Kept us here going since way back when
Now running wide open on a full moon night
Chasing this paper, tryin' to get my life right
Keg party waitin' for the man of the hour
Midnight shift for the money and the power

[Chorus]
It's just one of them nights, where anything goes
Got a whole lot of shine, a lil somethin' to smoke
Bonfire so high, you could see it from the road
Got somethin' real fine, tryn' to pull her real close

It's just one of them nights, where anything goes
Got a whole lot of shine, a lil somethin' to smoke
Bonfire so high, you could see it from the road
Got somethin' real fine, tryn' to pull her real close

[Verse 2]
Uh, big bottle of whisky, fresh on all that pine
Got somethin' real fine, spendn' some quality time
Tryn' unwind at a bonfire, it's so high
You could see it for miles, it's just one of them nights
Where anything goes, It ain't nothin' off limits
We livin' like this might be our last night of living
Mixin' pleasure and business, make drop poppn' tops
All mason jars full of, this season's best crops
We party til we drop, wake up party tomorrow
Ain't no reason to go, if you ain't going hard
If anyone deserves a celebration, it'd be us
Been workin' so hard, for the last nine months
Studio to the bus, from the bus to the stage
Back to the bus, wake up next day the same thing
Then it's back to the kitchen, cookn' up somethin' delicious
One-eighty proof and them switches
It's just one of them nights, where anything goes
Got a whole lot of shine, a lil somethin' to smoke
Bonfire so high, you could see it from the road
Got somethin' real fine, tryn' to pull her real close
Yeah this is for them late night country boys pushin' for the paper
Sun up to sun down, take it straight with no chaser
The dirt road racers, bonfire kings
Boss of the sticks, with an outlaw regime
Jug of white whiskey and some fresh cut crop
That's how you push it to the limit when the party don't stop
Them southern gals love it, said "we're down for fight"
Cause you know anything can happen on a bonfire night

[Chorus]
It's just one of them nights, where anything goes
Got a whole lot of shine, a lil somethin' to smoke
Bonfire so high, you could see it from the road
Got somethin' real fine, tryn' to pull her real close

It's just one of them nights, where anything goes
Got a whole lot of shine, a lil somethin' to smoke
Bonfire so high, you could see it from the road
Got somethin' real fine, tryn' to pull her real close
