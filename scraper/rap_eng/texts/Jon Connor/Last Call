[Intro]
Raise your glass, I said toast motherfucker
Let me take you back to how the story begins
I'm often asked how me, Mo and Sav made AVM
And since people want to know how we linked up with each other
Let me tell you 'bout this story of me and my two brothers
And they ask me, they ask me, they ask and I tell 'em
Salute to Kanye West, best in the world
But let me tell y'all my story

[Verse 1]
So I was at this hole in the wall, just rapping doing my thing
Not thinking for one second the changes this night would bring
Spitting my heart out I was trying to live my dream
Then Ali grabbed me and said "Imma take you to meet Mateen"
I said "Mateen, who, Cleaves?", he said "Yeah, that's my brother"
I said "Word", he said "Yeah, you a cold motherfucker
Y'all got the same vibe and I think you should meet each other"
So I'm walking over humbled and I'm trying not to stutter cause
I was thinking "really?"
I was just thinking 'bout when they won the final four and won that did for my city
He looked at me and said "Nigga you Jon Connor? That nigga gave me your shit when I was chillin' with my barber
I been up on you, I've been tryina find you
And I don't want no money, and I ain't tryina sign you
I just think you got what it takes to make it out this bitch
And I'll do whatever it takes to help you"
He's been my brother ever since, so yeah

[Bridge]
Y'all know how I do
This is my way of saluting to those who inspired me
Made me wanna do what I do you know what I'm saying
If this shit makes you want to go back and listen to the real versions of these songs, my job is done
At least you're listening to good shit again
Alright verse 2 let's go!

[Verse 2]
So me and Mo had been on this grind for a while
Passing CDs out every week [?]
Yeah, every other week we would go to the D
We just wanted to be heard, gave the music out for free
And we be doing shows, I don't know how we survived
In these grimy ass clubs, barely made it out alive
I could laugh about it now but it wasn't comedy in fact
Niggas looking at me like: "We gon' rob him if he whack"
But that was payin' dues, and I knew that
And anything to get to my dream, I was gon' do that
So meanwhile my man Slacker worked up at 93.7
Anytime an artist came in through press, he would tell me
So Slacker hit me like "Ross coming to the station
I know it's a long shot, but you got some music you could play him?"
Me and Mo like "Fuck it my nigga we on the way"
End of the day, no it's the worst a nigga could say
So we get to the station, Slacker like
"Listen, that's my man Connor, and my homie be spittin'
If y'all don't like that one, y'all should listen to this one"
I fell like nobody in the room was paying attention
'Till I heard the dude next to me say
"Woo! My nigga that's cool, my nigga that's you?"
He said "My name Sav and your shit ain't half bad"
Him and Mo stepped in the hallway and they exchanged maths
So about a month later after sitting in the dark
Mo' hit me like "My man from Def Jam want to talk"
I'm like "He wanna talk? - Yeah he want you to play shit"
Crazy, he booked a flight from New York to my basement
Nervous but I'm playing shit and playing shit, on sight
'Till he like "Damn, play me something that I don't like"
Pacing back and forth in my basement he like
"Dawg, I think you sound special and I want to be involved"
So, we was vibing out, listening to music, he said
"It ain't about the money I believe that you can do it
I just think you got what it takes to make it out this bitch
And I'll do whatever it takes to help you"
He's been my brother ever since, so yeah

[Outro]
And there it is
You know what I'm saying?
It's a lot of people, you know, in this rap shit
That call you, call theirself your brother or whatever, but
Sav, Mo', Dr. Dre, y'all showed me the true definition you know what I'm saying?
Well, it goes beyond the music you make in the studio
It goes beyond the paychecks
It goes beyond what's in your bank account
You know what I'm saying? True definition
Y'all niggas stuck with me man
All Varsity, Aftermath for life
Let's make history my niggas
And I want to thank y'all the people, for sticking with me
I ain't gon' never let y'all down, y'all just ride with me
Until next time, it's the people's rapper
We out
