[Intro: Jon Connor]
This go to every hood
Every city, every state
Anybody living in poverty
Anybody in fucked up situations
Shit getting stupid
I don't give a fuck where you from
Ain't nothing cool about dying young
[Verse 1: Jon Connor]
Now every show is packed, full house
I feel like Danny Tanner
I've done been through hell and back
You see I done got a little tanner
When you think of real shit you think of me
I'm a walking banner
When I say real shit that's artistry that ain't be tampered
And I just stay myself
You'd be amazed with what that do for niggas
Cause I ain't never shoot no nigga
And I'm from where niggas be shooting niggas
Give me your ear
Get it clear
Other than that I don't want nothin from you
I rap like this because I'm from the hood
And I don't want to go back to that motherfucker
You like that shit
I don't buy that shit
I'm talkin to the niggas that buy that shit
Cause I'm from Flint, Michigan where it really goes down
And I survived that shit
You talk about shooting this
Selling this
Buying shit
Supplying shit
Young niggas dying because they really go out and try that shit
Those punchlines that you pretend
We see that shit every weekend
Niggas get wet up everyday
How about you letting that sink in
Making a nigga go off the deep end
That will make a nigga say fuck that
Because you keep on screamin nigga bust that
In a city where niggas really bust that
And no I'm not your dad
I ain't preaching, we ain't in school
But I refuse to let you dudes
Talk about death like the shit is cool
Because it's the bullets, and it's the crime
And it's the caskets at the funeral
The retaliation back
But you niggas can't see that shit from the studio
You buying in to that wack shit
Stop buying into this rap shit
That hood shit look cool to you
How cool he look in that casket
They like
Connor, he ain't no street nigga
No, Connor he ain't no weak nigga
My nerves are bad like a Vietnam vet
Cause gunshots kept me from sleeping nigga
How cool is that
You want that shit
That ain't nothin for me to brag about
Because if that's the crown
We ain't even got to have it out
You niggas want it you can have it now
Niggas slug it out
Niggas living and dying for stripes
That nobody don't give a fuck about
When my niggas died
Life just went on
You ain't nothin about 'em
Ain't nothing stop
No schools got closed
No work postponed
No holidays for 'em
They just were gone
Birthdays gone
Children go
Christmas gone
So this one is for them
Stop the stupid shit just for a minute
That's what this was for
And fuck what people say
Because life is worth living for

[Outro - Sample from CB4]
You ain't tough
You ain't from the street
I'm from the street
And only someone who wasn't would think it was something to glorify
