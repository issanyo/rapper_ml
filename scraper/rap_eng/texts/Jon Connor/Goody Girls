Intro:
Sit back, tip back, feel the wind between my hair
Riding shotgun wit you we could end up anywhere
Sit back, tip back, while I roll another sack
Feeling good in the morning, best day I've ever had!

Chorus:
She riding shotgun, bad as hell
Play the passenger seat like a pro
She’s my Bonnie and she know, she know I'm ready
When she ready, watch my girl put on a show
Says she’s ready for the world, she my girl
And now let’s go, Let them know
I’m riding shotgun, bad as hell
Play the passenger seat like a pro
He my Clyde and I know he know I’m ready
When he ready, baby I’ll put on a show!
If you ready then just hit me, I’m your girl
And now lets go, let them know
Yeah, she got the goodies when I need it, goodies, goodies when I need it
Yeah, goodies when I need it, goodies, goodies when I need it
She got them goodies when I need it, goodies, goodies when I need it
Let’s go!
Goodies when I need it, goodies, goodies when I need it!

Verse 1:
She got angels eyes but she bad as hell
Got me locked in a padded cell, insane brain on a balcony
Say is it good? I'm like hell yeah
Look how she got all they attention
So bad, she don’t pay attention
Sex and drugs every night
She hit the pipe and got her addicted
Take you to Miami, I could take you to Atlanta
I could take you around the world, but I won’t take you for granted
Granted it’s a whole lot of ones, making empty promises
All about that fake shit, but see you did the opposite
Y'all take them trophy wives, and she gonna take your shit
You in the rush to be broke as fuck, now that no make no sense!
Because they be for all the wrong shit
Baby take a long walk off a short cliff
When you find that one you keeping
At all times, she be there when you need it

Chorus:
She riding shotgun, bad as hell
Play the passenger seat like a pro
She’s my Bonnie and she know, she know I'm ready
When she ready, watch my girl put on a show
Says she’s ready for the world, she my girl
And now let’s go, Let them know
I’m riding shotgun, bad as hell
Play the passenger seat like a pro
He my Clyde and I know he know I’m ready
When he ready, baby I’ll put on a show!
If you ready then just hit me, I’m your girl
And now lets go, let them know

Verse 2:
She told me give it to her when she want it
Want it every night and morning
Morning she be on here riding like a stripper pole
We pouring Moet like it’s flowing out the faucet don’t know how to act!
Now I’m living like a boss, I could throw my girl a rack
Give her green out the blue, she don’t even gotta ask huh
Hell no, I wouldn't give my cheese to no rats
Fake niggers couldn’t stab me, cause she always have my back
Sex go hard, every position you could check the stats
Work the shit about them heels bad as hell up in them flats
Front like she got pretty hair, like we don’t know them shits is tracks
But it’s all good girl leaving with no makeup on
So fly, can't even tell the makeup gone, and now that's why she riding

Chorus:
She riding shotgun, bad as hell
Play the passenger seat like a pro
She’s my Bonnie and she know, she know I'm ready
When she ready, watch my girl put on a show
Says she’s ready for the world, she my girl
And now let’s go, Let them know
I’m riding shotgun, bad as hell
Play the passenger seat like a pro
He my Clyde and I know he know I’m ready
When he ready, baby I’ll put on a show!
If you ready then just hit me, I’m your girl
And now lets go, let them know
Yeah, she got them goodies when I need it, goodies, goodies when I need it
