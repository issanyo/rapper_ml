[Intro]
Wagin wars to shake the poet and the beat
I hope its gonna make you notice
I hope its gonna make you notice

[Hook X1]
Someone like me, ohh ohhh
Someone like me, ohh ohhh
Someone like me

[Verse 1]
Alright, I'm livin my dream so watch as I close my eyes, niggas don't know my life
How the fuck you think you can walk in my shoes when yall dont even know my size
Never been a gimmick, just a young nigga with lyrics, hopin that the world wanna hear it
Tryna give you classics and not average, but nowadays niggas don't know the difference
See if I talk shit, that raw shit, chance is that my record ain't spinnin
And if I drop shit, and I flop shit, I gotta start back at the beginning
Oh cold world, what a crazy dilemma, and I got caught in the middle
Yeah makin a difference or makin a livin but shit I gotta make a decision
I ain't never been a quitter, how can I stop, none of the fake shit cuz that I'm not
I'mma give this shit all I got, I been through hell so I know I'm hot
Gotta shut me down before they shut me up, power 100 proof I'm drunk as fuck
Oh I see exactly what the game needs

[Hook X1]

[Verse 2]
This some kind of mistake, nah he in line with his fate
Attitude never say die, and that's combined with his faith
My time was comin, I just ain't know how much time it would take
They hear my soul in my shit, cuz I ain't signed it away
Oh and I never will, fuck em I'm always real
Bein some shit you ain't, how the fuck do u niggas live
How the fuck do you niggas feel, landon street in me still
Too much drive inside me to ever let another nigga steer
See, I would never lie to you look in my eyes I would die for you
Put one finger in the sky for you
Fuck what another nigga tyna do
Leave my soul on the stage cuz I got down from the high for you
Fuck critics, cuz I'm authentic, my time gon last longer than 15 minutes
Meant it when I said that I'm headin to the top
Don't try n follow me mamma said the sky is the limit
And I believe dat, so I'mma be that
When you put limits on and I exceed that
See you perceive that, cuz you can see that
Rock and that hard place, I'm in between that
Niggas that hate me, I know you don't mean that
Shit ain't scored thats what its gonna be
The blind gon see, its been a long time since the game seen
