[Verse 1]
Well maybe this the proper introduction
The rudest interruption, it’s the flow that end discussions
Niggas said I was sick and shit it’s bout to get disgusting
I keep em lusting, your bitch get hit like percussion then send her back to her husband
Shit I been planning and plotting, every fan that’s been watching
We bonded, watch bodies piling like stopping was not an option
I’m so driven, niggas blinded, got no vision
Eddie Kendricks, I’m tempted to tend to some of these bitches
I ain’t gon limit the skill, I took the limitless pill
Kill em with the minimum, still nobody realer than [?]
Catch by these hoes, kissed by a rose, I’m sealing the deal, for real
Time is money, you have to pay me millions, chill
I ain’t afraid of work, shit I was made to work, I cast [?] your verse
Body shit, make people hate your verse, won’t even play your verse
Perform this shit live with you, you be scared to say your verse
Niggas standing round like damn this nigga can’t go first
I hear what I’m saying, shit the goal to make you change your verse
I can’t fuck with your funny style, nigga change your shirt
Drunk with power, this a hangover, my brain ain’t on earth
Down for life, might need a [?], this volcano work
Balling, niggas falling, bet they ankles hurt
City so broke, all we used to hearing is “man this shit ain’t gon work”
Ask me [?] for a deal and see who say no first
Y’all niggas suck, a fucking budget ain’t gon break your curse
I could do this shit all day, throw away the purse
I stay on my job, y’all just be happy I came to work
