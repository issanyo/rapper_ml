Intro

What up asshole? You just fell in a black hole
This a old school asswoopin, hang you drawers from a flag pole
Feeling froggy, ill destroy you while you still a tadpole
Type of nigga fuck yo sister while mommy and dad home
This the genesis fuck the world we friends with benefits
Tell the bitch "Close your eyes, open wide, and pretend its licorice"
Chicks standing at my dick hards not a coincidence
Keep rubbers in the event that it's up, there goes her innocence
First she say she loving you, now she at the W
On the first night tryna convince me that she never fucked with you
Pretty girl with a man back home, and now I'm hittin that, while you using your hand at home
And this a mystery to get with me, they forget all of they history
You telling them you love him, so why the fuck is he pissed at me?
Now this is the epitome of why bitches ain't shit to me
You known me 20 minutes, then keep talking about our chemistry
She told you she was drunk, she only had 3 beers
And threw away 3 years, and didn't shed 3 tears
I guess its probably, no its gotta be whats stopping me
From monogamy cause OJ'ing these hoes is honestly not for me
My nigga caught his girl cheating in his crib
Kids sleeping in his crib, so imagine what he did
Now he's doing the bid, she got away scott free
And I'm thinking to myself "HELL NAW!, NOT ME!" so
I stay focused, I be roasting you roaches
Get toasted, I get cheese but I never eat with the rodents
I won't stop, my empire compete with the romans
I just wana be the best, fucking you over is a bonus
Look, I kill shit, then I'm gone, send my condolence
Console em I told em I am the sickest spittin pneumonia
So at the end of the day before I put it down
They'll know this is the sound of me leaving with the crown
