[Intro]
This is a state of emergency
Rap music is in a Code Red right now
Basically that mean that shit sucks nigga

Who you thought it was?
Stand up! (4x)

[Main Verse]
Look
I walk around with my grade on my chain
So it's needless to say I stay on my 'A' game
While, y'all niggas choke like away games
Homeboy, I dominate; I don't play games
Stingy, giving a fuck ain't in me
I paint pictures, da Vinci
New flow of the century
Look, without a doubt I'm nice
My flow ruin your life like bad advice twice
My cardio is up to par, I run shit
Who fucking with me, I ain't hear you (Speak up!)
Niggas love it when I speak the beats, speak my piece
My food-for-thought give you a feast for weeks
I'm a known trend-setter, a whole lot better
Your man's flow sick, I'm a whole lot iller
Truck that, (nah) fuck that
You missin' a father figure, my nigga I son rap, You
Shoot for the moon you will land in the stars
I'm from where they shoot at your dude and get landed in bars
Not only that, not only that
Connor, Jeff, Dom, yeah I'm killin' these cats
I'm better than, it's evident
The war I'm in, I'm killing these veterans
The future's what you see today
Niggas lost, let me lead the way
(Flint City, I'm back!) Yeah!

[Outro]
Stand up!
Who you thought it was?
Stand up! (9x)
Wave, wave
Flint City I got you!
A-Squad I got you!
You knew it was my time, right?
The future's officially now
Fuck changin' the game, the game has officially been changed
What's my motherfucking name?
Y'all miss that shit right? (2x)
Niggas mad, right?
I see, I hear niggas being mad
Being mad ain't gonna help y'all niggas out of this one
The motherfuckin' People's Rapper
â€¦
Connor!
