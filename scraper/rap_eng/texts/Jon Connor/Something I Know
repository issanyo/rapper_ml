[Intro]
Now everybody put them hands in the sky
Everybody put them hands in the sky
One time at 'em, one time at 'em
Now everybody put them hands in the sky
Everybody put them hands in the sky
Everybody put them hands in the

[Verse 1]
She were the type anybody would like
Cause even when I'm wrong she be like, baby you right
And it ain't that she weak she don't wanna pick a fight
Anytime I gotta leave she even help me pick a flight
She be there in a minute
She always knew the right shit to say because she mean it
She had a broken heart so I'mma mend it
I'm pretending that I could do
Should've told this girl from the beginning
She lovesick I got her in the clinic
Ah, if ever there was perfect
I wish I could resemble that image cause you deserve it
I'm in the game doing that melody and derwin
Making decisions a vicious circle that left you hurting
Her only crime she wanted too much time
And watching twilight was the last thing on my mind
Feel me, but thinking about a couple minutes wouldn't killed me
So this song is for the one person and I hope she get it

[Hook]
I wanna know if this is as far as it go
What you feelin' I'mma feelin' and that's the same as before
Yeah that's just something I know
Yeah that's just something I know
Yeah that's just something I know
Yeah that's just something I know
I wanna kick it in I know it's been a minute
But you been feeling exactly how I'm feeling
And that's the same as before
Yeah that's just something I know
Yeah that's just something I know

[Verse 2]
Girl number two, would you still be admiring me before the music
She had a dream, too so ambitious it was the cutest
Wanted to go away to school,I'm the one to tell her pursue it
Always knew it but nobody ever encouraging her to do it
Look,so I became a motivation
Her free spirit and her smile kept me motivated
She changing a nigga who thought love was overrated
Cause smug butchets before her made me fucking hate it
Huh, guess I was tainted from the star
And on the day that you would leave I would just blame it on my heart
Judging you off my past and that's what's tearing us apart
She ain't here, so I guess my heart isn't as forgiving as I thought
Look, scared of the distance trying to convience you that we should end it
I'm full of shit I'm telling you it's in your best interest
The real truth is that was love and we was in it
So this verse is for the one girl and I hope she hears it

[Hook]
I wanna know if this is as far as it go
What you feeling I'mma feeling and that's the same as before
Yeah that's just something I know
Yeah that's just something I know
Yeah that's just something I know
Yeah that's just something I know
I wanna kick it in I know it's been a minute
But you been feeling exactly how I'm feeling
And that's the same as before
Yeah that's just something I know
Yeah that's just something I know

[Outro]
Now everybody put them hands in the sky
Everybody put them hands in the sky
Everybody put them hands in the sky
Everybody put them hands in the sky
Now everybody put them hands in the
