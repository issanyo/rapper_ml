They say the good die young, so the bad die old
Guess we somewhere in the middle, so just pray for my soul
All I want to do is right, but all I'm seeing is wrong
And I'm trying to stay strong but its taking its toll
And I ain't no better than you so when you playing this song
And you feeling how I'm feeling, just know that you ain't alone
Everyday you wake up, another day that it's on
So we got to wake up before what we seeing is gone

Since the beggining, the mirror of what I've written
Real has been my description, ain't never been nothing different
Love me or hate me, just know its me you lovin' or hatin'
So there will never be an issue with what judgement your making
High school, I knew who I was, I had direction
A leader, I don't follow nobody, always progressing
So every girl in highschool a ho, was the perception
Coz lame niggas lied on their dick, to get accepted
Takin' a girls purity to get a sense of security
Now she insecure, she get older and she ain't sure of me
And I ain't sayin' I'm an angel or saint
But one of these days I might need her to be wifey, but she can't
Coz now she don't trust niggas, all the time fuck niggas
Coz if she don't she thinking then no nigga gon' fuck with her
Both male and female, lost in misdirection
It's a crazy world when you live in a misconception

She had the university trying to fit in, blowing intuition
Was a good girl back at the crib, but now she different
Blowin' trees, she was never into it
It's the influence of her roomy, she with it coz all her friends do it
Back home she knew people, now she with these new people
She don't know herself no more, now she feeling like two people
Niggas in the dorm, 3am, thinking they cool people
Trying to keep up with this bullshit can consume people
Talking loud, wrong crowd, ya'll fucking the same dudes
Feeling like you can't move, this painful, this ain't you
You stay loose, cranberry juice and grey goose
Can't shake ya head at them hoes, coz you doing what they do
Niggas play you, too far gone, who gon' save you
Funny how shit could have been, if you had stayed you
Out of control on the path of misdirection
It's the crazy life when you live in misconception

The coolest nigga in high school, was exactly that
The coolest nigga in high school, time passed right by you
Passing days of glory, keep telling them war stories
Leaching off baby mommas, he never set his priorities
Already finding, his best days is behind him
The hoes that he used to fuck, is what defines him
Sleeping on different couches, got seeds in three different houses
But if you ask about him, he barely know nothing bout em'
I don't want him around me, all I know about him
Is he broke and he brag about being in and out the county
And since when is not being shit, the shit?
When there's only one life to live, I hope you listen huh?
Still alive, done living at twenty five
Stuck in the hood, but never got out coz he never tried
Look, check your brother, but check yourself first
The truth hurts, but we can all change after this

Shits real... It's too real
