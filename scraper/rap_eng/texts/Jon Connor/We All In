[Verse 1]
I'm the last of a extinct breed
I came from nothing, where ain't no future in fronting
Nigga, respect Breed
Now through these lyrics I'mma take you through a place
Where every day is a fight to survive and stay alive
Could put this shit on pay-per-view
Could never cater to a hater's view
Cause in your face a nigga's smiling
You walk away and he hating you
I'm hater-proof, you can't imagine what I seen in store
Keep acting, my city raw; you ever seen a scene from Saw?
That's how it play out -- you niggas is Pee-wee's Playhouse
Thinking the hood is cool; we trying to get out and stay out
Cause when the war break out, you niggas'll Harlem Shake out
Flint niggas sitting in front of your crib like a stakeout
It's, more than music, this life, I get enthusiastic
I just became used to it and tried to use my influence
To make the hood wake up from yellow tape and wakes
We got no time to make up, but it's never too late

[Hook]
It's a war 'round here, it's getting real for my real niggas
Look in that man's eyes, see who on the battlefield with ya
Look to yourself when nobody else real with ya
And stay true to your folks, when you down they gon' be still with ya
We gotta get, get, get it, we all in
So we take, take, take it, we all in
Gotta get, get, get it, we all in
So we take, take, take it, we all in

[Verse 2]
Look, I'm from where bitches never satisfied, kids got the saddest eyes
Cause mom still a kid inside, and their hopes for a dad expired
I know the story of hopeless and homeless broken
And you can only be open with teachers and (?)
That's best scenario, but other than that
There ain't nowhere to go but in the room and turning up the stereo
Y'all ready for that real shit again, ain't you?
Well this's as real as it is and you can hear it, can't you?
We grind hard just to grind harder, tryna be ballers
Either vent for Shawn Carter. Who we? A part of this
A new beginning or the same ending without change
We gon' recycle the same conditions, now pay attention
No blood on my hands, if you get in the spot
If you feeling what I'm saying then y'all should put 'em high
High, for the world and peace, to the drama
It's a war 'round here and Osama can't crack my armor

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
So who ride and who getting it with me? Then get em up
You ain't doing, you talking about it, that ain't enough
I'm pushing the envelope nigga, fuck a nudge
I'm focused on getting up, who fucking with me? You fucking up
I'm tired of seeing niggas that beef over bitches tied
Or women that's beefing over these ain't-shit niggas, ha
The preachers, preachers say that it's all about unity
Usually these niggas live better than half the community
Holla, how you gon' be the one that I'm 'posed to follow
'Posed to be all 'bout the people but really all 'bout the dollar
Look I'm, tired of racism, ain't nothing but hating
I'mma preach it to y'all, 'till y'all done brought out the medicine
Girls getting called out they name, and getting mad by it
But niggas wouldn't call you a ho, if you ain't act like it
Look, I'm just hoping these words reach you
The People's Rapper still doing it for the people

[Hook]
