[Intro]
Join us or die

[Verse 1: Thello Jay]
I'm a light-skinned ghost, Chester holy ghost Martin
Hey little nigga, I'mma finish what you started
We fuck in every room, so we rented out apartments
Weed by the pound, drinks by the cartons
Last year, nigga I was motherfucking starving
I needed food bad, so I slaved my own garden
Your whole team's squares and half of y'all targets
Fake thug artist, proceed here with caution
It don't matter where you're from, only how you make it
Before I step off the plane they anticipating
Y'all went and bought a buzz, I went and got respect
I'm so above, make the music started cutting checks
Lame ass niggas acting Hollywood
You will never be in the game, you probably should
I hate when niggas say that I probably could
So I'mma end this verse with God is good

[Hook: Thello Jay]
Make 'em wanna roll when you dream out
Make 'em wanna roll when you dream out
Make 'em wanna roll when you dream out
Make 'em wanna go and get they dream house
When you dream out
Make 'em wanna roll when you dream out
Make 'em wanna roll when you dream out
Make 'em wanna go and get they dream house

[Verse 2: Jon Connor]
Allow me to present the event of this season
Get off me y'all, it's salty
But y'all needed a little bit of seasoning
With no reason, please impeach them
Opposite of industry politics, real as they come
Who realer than him? I don't see none
As many be talking that shit about how they gon' come, I be getting it done
Well done, burn 'em
Y'all thought y'all was hot? Here hell come
I nail hoes, y'all only get called when they need they nails done
Homeboy, I got bars like ain't no bail come
Get your bail wrong when I spit this shit it's like a fucking nail gun
Fail because y'all frail, but it ain't like that where I hail from
Flint Michigan is what I yell, uh
We don't take L's, victory dance
Mentally menacing innocent niggas, don't give 'em a chance
My venom'll get 'em that feeling that's having them shit in they pants
Who gon' nay-say, when me Kenny and J Day
Valley out in Cali, low ridin' like it's Dre day
Look, I hold it down when I'm out of town, nigga
Midwest at its best, me and my Chi town niggas

[Hook]

[Outro]
When you dream out
When you dream out
When you dream out
Make 'em wanna go and get they dream house
