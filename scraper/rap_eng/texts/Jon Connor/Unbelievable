[Verse 1 - Jon Connor]
Look, it ain't coincidence they don't want incident
When I'm soliciting, I'll have 'em feminine
Bitching and bickering, been getting Benjamins
You try to fit in, I ain't blending in
From Michigan, and I got a strong mind like I been in the gym
You wrote your top 5, I noticed that my name's missing
I'm what the game missing, the nigga doper than cane sniffing
I could fuck your bitch and that wasn't even my main mission
You still whack and I kill tracks, we aim different
My punch lines like Undertaker and Kane hit 'em
Money and fame got bitches saying my name different
I'm making movie scenes with movie queens
What she can do they no previews
The type of shit you can't do on movie screens
This what it truly means to kill these verses
Usually a eulogy, if you and me were feuding, really do compete
I'm Tim the tool man, I nail a ho and screw a freak
Tits for beats, the New Orleans, but that's my life all through the week
Woah...

It's unbelievable (Biggie Smalls is the illest) [x4]

[Verse 2 - Jon Connor]
Look, I went from something to nothing, fronting to fucking
I went from bluffing to crushing and having 'em blushing
I went from barely could touch it, she scared that we rushing
Now not for nothing, I'm Picasso when it comes to the art of seduction
When I was duecey, girls used to call me a cutie
Pursue me then I'm R.Kelly feeling on your booty
And if she boojie put her legs up in the hooky
Bumping 2Pac while she do me, tried out dating while they shooting teach you more than college
The boy's so fly that I could soar a pilot
Shit I'm bored with flying, constant orbit when I perform a rhyme, and
You make me snore, I'm bored and when I record, immortalize me
Taking my time and I'm letting it burn
Taking it back and it feel like the 90s
Where did you find me
My city was grimy but didn't let it defy me
Just put it behind me
Motivation, I take it and let it remind me
The reason I'm breathing for, the shit that I'm doing is seeming unreasonable
Not to be cocky but I'm unbelievable
Woah...

[Hook]
