She confesses, I listen
I pretend to be attentive with attention
Take the words from your mouth
I hear a sound but only moaning comes out
She says it's just this one time
It's now the tenth time
I know there's someone waiting up for you all night
But I'm not perfect and you're not finished
I'll be your mister, you can always be my mistress
I mix my vices with vics
It makes the devil on my shoulder seem nice
She's playing princess, snow white
I won't stop her, you can say that I tried

I keep keep banging that drum
She keep keep begging for some
You know I will, (you know I will)
You know I will, (you know I will)
She needs some love in her life
Cause you ain't doing it right
You know I will, (you know I will)
You know I will, (you know I will)
I'm just a lover, her favourite colour
Wears me once a week but I'm not the one
I keep keep banging then drum
He picks you up when we're done
You know I will, (you know I will)
You know I will, (you know I will)

Another Xanny, I'm stumbling
Another Ros√©
But her hands do all the talking
While her friend's here and she's watching
So she begs me for that one thing (one thing)
I feel her temperature rise
X is hitting and she's loving the ride
Heat up every position we try
She gets it twice because I'm such a nice guy

I keep keep banging that drum
She keep keep begging for some
You know I will, (you know I will)
You know I will, (you know I will)
She needs some love in her life
Cause you ain't doing it right
You know I will, (you know I will)
You know I will, (you know I will)
I'm just a lover, her favourite colour
Wears me once a week but I'm not the one
I keep keep banging then drum
He picks you up when we're done
You know I will, (you know I will)
You know I will, (you know I will)

Her phone rings, it's time
You know he's waiting outside
The night comes to an end
And Ill see you again
If you want it
Yeah you want it
Girl I know you think this is love
It's obvious you can't get enough
When the drugs wear off
And we're both undone
It's the best night of your life and won't tell anyone
Girl I know you think this is love
And I know you can't get enough

I keep banging that drum
She keep begging for some
You know I will, (you know I will)
You know I will, (you know I will)
She needs some love in her life
Cause you ain't doing it right
You know I will, (you know I will)
You know I will, (you know I will)
I'm just a lover, her favourite colour
Wears me once a week, but I'm not the one
I keep keep banging then drum
He picks you up when we're done
You know I will, (you know I will)
Where you going I'm thinking of showing you back to the crib
The reaction I get when you trip on the fact that we actually here
We ain't letting nothing from the present or the past interfere
Your man have your back, shit he'd be right here
But he's not
Anytime he around you be looking at the clock
I hate to put you on the spot
But you be telling me he dead to me, I'm doing what he not
I know you feeling like it's better than it ever was
When you be telling me to tear it up
And everything you ever heard about a real motherfucker laying it down was everything they said it was
We goin' do it like we 'sposed to
He don't do it like he want you
We gon' do everything you want to
Sick of all the drama that you've been through
I don't understand it why you putting up with old dude
I can tell it's getting a little confusing when I hold you
You be telling me don't nobody know you the way I know you
Problem is I got a lady at home too
I know the role I play so what you goin' do?
As soon as it's all ending
And I've gotta look at myself in the mirror while pretending
That I didn't do what I promised
Some things should stay private
You assume I'm lying
I can't change my name
And you can't change your eyelids
Can't unsee the truth
Even Cali can't fix you
You know I will, (you know I will)

We fucked each other up
Trying to fix it but didn't have a clue
For the first time
I'm finally ready to say
For the first time
The past can rest in peace
