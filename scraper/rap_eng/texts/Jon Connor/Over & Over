[Hook (x2)]
Can't can't no nigga do it, do it like me
Flow flows so sick, need a, need a IV
Pull up, pull up at the party, all the bitches on me
Flow flows so sick, need a, need a IV

[Verse 1]
I handle my business
So hoes ask me what the business is
All her niggas rich niggas
And that ain't by coincidence
I ain't, I ain't no sucker, so I know the drill
Girl take it off, take it off
And let me know it's real
If you in my presence, that's a present
Tell me how it feel
To step outside and a crowd appears
She like I wanna fuck you so bad
But it's too loud in here
But it's too loud in here?
Get the fuck out of here
I be wildin' out for the days when I was on (?)
Funny when you getting money
How people be mad at you
When niggas say
Fuck you and your attitude
Fuckboy, I show you how to do it
This should be gratitude
I'm a motherfucker, fuck your mother
That bitch ratchet too
She should have had second thoughts instead of having you
On second thought, nah y'all can stick around
Haters just here to remind me
I'm good at my fucking job

[Hook (x2)]
Can't can't no nigga do it, do it like me
Flow flows so sick, need a, need a IV
Pull up, pull up at the party, all the bitches on me
Flow flows so sick, need a, need a IV

[Verse 2]
Take one, go on girl, play that role
All you wanna do is chill, huh?
Say no more
This rap game I swear be mindfucking
A couple chicks in the VIP
I swear I wouldn't mind fucking
Girl let me know
Is it cool or is it cool
Cause your girl tryna get at me
But I swear I wouldn't fuck with you
Ain't (?) enough shit
Drink till you fall out
Shit right now, Hennessy got us all like fuck world
I'm feeling too good dawg
I might just fuck your girl
She in my reach (my reach)
Tell your hoe don't speak
You (?) with your bitch
But she runnin' out here without a leash
Shit the night still young
My night ridiculous
For I know it, here the daylight come
Fast life, got off with a slow start
My life a trip, I see y'all (?)
Motherfucker
