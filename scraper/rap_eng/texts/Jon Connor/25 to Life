Too late for the other side
Caught in a chase 25 to life
Too late for the other side
Caught in a chase 25 to life

[Intro]
I guess I asked for this right
I mean that's what they say

[Verse 1: Jon Conner]
I pretend like I don't hurt but ya'll don't know my pain
It's like over the years you just get numb this shit is novocaine
They like Connor why you ain't rich man ya'll don't know the game
It ain't all about rapping and your talent that's what they don't explain
I get called Connor so much that I don't know my name
I get called Connor so much I wanna blow my brains
Just to have someone who can relate go talk to Kurt Cobain
Then I sit back and think of James and I get so ashamed
Before I can gather all my thought's I'm right back on a plane
Staring out the window in the clouds like here we go again
The world expects me deliver hail sleet snow or rain
So my heart bleeds through this pen like I broke a vein
All I talk about now is music all I know is this
My closest friends say that it seems like sometimes I'm emotionless
I think it started when I seen my cousin lie there motionless
Ain't have time to deal with it so I never got over it
I just went back to rhyming back to the studio business as usual
All the while I'm thinking what the fuck do I do this for
For the haters that berate you even though you never met 'em
That wanna see you fail that'll kill your spirit if you let 'em
What? Do it for the the doubters that'll doubt you
When they know nothing about you
Hope they can find your weakness so they can bring it out you
Naw, I don't do it for my enemies or the industry
I do it for the memories
Of those I love and letting them know how much they meant to me

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Jon Conner]
For real I be like who do I tell this when I'm feeling helpless
Don't wanna burden nobody with my problems that'd be selfish
I see people with genuine smiles and then I get jealous
A prisoner of passion inside my mind's where jail is
Remember Sam told me you think they hate you now
In this business people build you up just to break you down
They will wait till you're gone why I can't get that thank you now
The attention that you crave will be the same shit that'll take you down
We saw Whitney struggling and did we offer to help her no
We made her a trending topic and just watched her on the TV show
Passing judgement with no repercussion so easy though
Ya'll can do all the tributes you want but she ain't here no more
What we doing? misery and pain is televised and we just tune in like
What cause you do music you ain't human the shit is stupid
I saw Amber Rose crying on MTV and I just watched like
Damn this is entertainment how far will it go before it stop
Your relationship ends and I'm sure you want your space
Their relationship ends the cameras shoved all in their face
Ain't no asking for compassion because your words will go to waste
All the money that they give you don't compare to what they take
Look, Michael gave his whole life that ain't an exaggeration
How'd we thank him for it? With Tabloids and accusations
I done done too much to ever turn from this direction
Ain't shit I can do to change it so I guess I'll just accept it
Damn
