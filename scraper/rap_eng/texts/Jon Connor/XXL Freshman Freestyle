[Verse]
The most consistent and the most convincing
They say I'm gifted like I'm asking what you want for Christmas
Niggas ain't eatin' like they cabinet full of broken dishes
I hope for disses, I just kill it
More reason to make em' float with fishes
I been nicer than the writers that you liking
The brain fool way more than the cyphers that you biting
This a blue diamond, I drop gems, I drop hymns
I got the juice, it feel like Pac' when he popped Steel
You liking these rappers you think that they hot, but they not real
I don't stop when I drop off the top of the knot and get a cop killed
Lookin' for the best in the world, well, I'm here so that slot filled
You niggas suck, you really don't wanna know how Doc feel
This is all varsity, artistry, architect for the art of it
Revampin' the culture, I'm just happy to be a part of it
Got this shit locked, my nigga more bars than the law from it
Flint Michigan listenin', you are witnessin' dominance
Fulfillin' my promises, it ain't even a matter of common sense
The difference between us is obvious
My nigga, just look where the comma sits
For real
