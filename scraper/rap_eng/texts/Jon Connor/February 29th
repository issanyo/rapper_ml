[Chorus: CyHi The Prynce]
Tell the waitress bring the bottle, put it in the ice
I swear to God that I had many nights
Of fucking bitches, live the marijuana remy life
Party like it's February twenty-ninth
Ninth, ninth
We gon' party like it's February twenty-ninth
Ninth, ninth
We gon' party like

[Verse 1: CyHi The Prynce]
And artist like me is seen every leap year
So lets party like a frat-house with cheap beer
We the premier, niggas in the street dear
Keep this piece near, blood on my seat spear
Let it be clear, the only thing that he fears
Not being referred as the black [?]
Without yall thinking he weird
Im talking John P quier
My shit sheer, I used to sweep beer
But until then I keep the presidential
Rollie shinning brilliant
Feel like Im Bill Clint
Shawty said she wasn't going, but she still went
Been around the world twice, but Im still prynce
I seen my ex in the club, she probably got the same number
Call er right now, I bet you she would still be sprint
Flew out to Paris, Imma send my chauffeur
If you call him Pierre, either way its still French
So

[Chorus: CyHi The Prynce]
Tell the waitress bring the bottle, put it in the ice
I swear to God that I had many nights
Of fucking bitches, live the marijuana remy life
Party like it's February twenty-ninth
Ninth, ninth
We gon' party like it's February twenty-ninth
Ninth, ninth
We gon' party like

[Verse 2: Jon Connor]
Who am i to say what I deserve and if I really deserve it?
I get to play with these words while the world is barely keep turning
Determined to get it, born in the city, I didn't fit in
Cause killin' was always sought, now we yellin' "michigan we did it"
I used to have drama, I used to not sleep
Now I got a bunch of J's that have never been on my feet
Meanwhile, I'm reflecting, don't take a second for granted I just accept that my quest is to be the best when you handed this oppurtunity
Shit, your only choice to go get it, for all my niggas missin' I deserve all these ritches and bitches
Who said that I don't, who said that I won't be up on some new shit
Got two bitches they 22, who makin' room for a new chick I got it
I know I got it and don't it feel right
Shit, I can't explain with these words what it feel like
When everything that you dreamed about is your real life
We about to take a leap of faith like its the 29th
What!

[Chorus: CyHi The Prynce]
Tell the waitress bring the bottle, put it in the ice
I swear to God that I had many nights
Of fucking bitches, live the marijuana remy life
Party like it's February twenty-ninth
Ninth, ninth
We gon' party like it's February twenty-ninth
Ninth, ninth
We gon' party like

[Verse 3: Zip K]
It's Zip K
Uh, born raised and Decatur-bred
On Thomas Bakery bakin', that's that Decatur bread
In school, I majored in major money and major risks
I ain't majored yet but, shit I pay the rent
Hottest with the gram since Insta
Grown party raps, every bars a bar mitzvah
See how many hoes that new foreign car get ya
Tryin' to live your dreams out before the law pinch ya
Wake up, wake up, tryin' to get my cake up
Cliché, cliché, all the shit we make up
One hit rappers at the labels 'til they break up
Niggas need a hard drive, all the space you take up
Make room, please like, niggas, uh, move please
Now you get the looks and whispers like "who's these"
Never marry pussy I know she's a groupy
Even though its tight, I use that term loosely
And uh

[Chorus: CyHi The Prynce]
Tell the waitress bring the bottle, put it in the ice
I swear to God that I had many nights
Of fucking bitches, live the marijuana remy life
Party like it's February twenty-ninth
Ninth, ninth
We gon' party like it's February twenty-ninth
Ninth, ninth
We gon' party like

[Verse 4: CyHi The Prynce]
Back when Twan had the Monte Carlo with the t-tops
Jabo in my Reeboks, I was tryin' to beatbox
Now I'm in the CL Smooth: Pete Rock
We not on the same level you biatch
Y'all won the BET Awards, I'm tryin' to win the EGOT
For your information: kiosk
Sorry to keep you waitin': Detox
Landmark of Stone Mountain, I'm like the main street clocks
Shit I might zip up to the party in a Fiat
Postered like I'm [?], standin' on the furniture
I with the girl I used to like in high-school, tryin' to put my bit in but I never got my turn with her
But tonight it feels right it's like timber for two skies and they go blue mercedes-benz with no roof
So let your hair down, you with the prince for the night
Even though I never be uptight
It don't matter

[Chorus: CyHi The Prynce]
Tell the waitress bring the bottle, put it in the ice
I swear to God that I had many nights
Of fucking bitches, live the marijuana remy life
Party like it's February twenty-ninth
Ninth, ninth
We gon' party like it's February twenty-ninth
Ninth, ninth
We gon' party like
