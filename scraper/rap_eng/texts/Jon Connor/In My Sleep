It goes down easy

[Verse 1: Tito Lopez]
They give a real talk of the year award?
Okay, so y'all wanna know what it's like for niggas rhyming?
All they love is gone
But they force you to find a silver lining
And the playbook empty
Done ran through every possible option
So blue collar man, they think I'm crippin' like Mississippi's Compton
And the check ain't went through
How about the bread I lent you?
Got a few views on Youtube
Guess I ain't got to pay rent too, huh?
Ever think you meant to do that one thing that you love to do?
So you take a chance, take the stage and the ground move up under you
And you drop
And you keep falling, keep falling feel like it's never gonna stop
And it's ironic
Because you in this bottomless pit before you get to the top
And the cold sweats
Waking up still in the projects, no progress
Is this a dream or a nightmare?
I don't know yet
Then I get that call from my lil bro and he tells me I'm his hero
Just when I thought my life was screwed up like Texas
Got a second in and picked up the pieces
I'm a different species
Me and Connor: death before dishonor
Holla at me man

[Hook: Jon Connor]
I lock myself up in my room at night and pray to God
They told me one day shit gonna change but I felt this way for so long
I lock myself up in my room at night
Hope He hear me crying in my room at night

I lock myself up in my room at night and pray to God
They told me one day shit gonna change but I felt this way for so long
I lock myself up in my room at night
Pray He hear me crying in my room at night

[Verse 2: Jon Connor]
Ain't nobody gonna give you props
'til the world jump on your nuts
It's just that simple
By then you won't give a fuck
All the nights you was by yourself
Couldn't get nobody to pick up the phone
All the days you wanted to reach out
Ain't nobody have arms that long
Had a dream I was back on the playground
And I ain't have a care in the world
Haters won't let me breathe
Like ain't enough air in the world
All the nights I spent on this writing shit
It ain't fair my girl
She ain't wanna let go, but I had to let go
If I couldn't be there for my girl
I ain't never by myself
Always get through myself
I really don't give a fuck
But I guess I never really apply myself
It's just easier that way
Cause people come and people go
Only thing constant is change
Everything you see gonna go
I don't want you to feel my pain
Feeling yours is hard enough
Find a reason to smile
Yeah I know this shit hard as fuck
Reminisce on the things you love
Give thanks for the things you have
Take a deep breath, look at where you at
Follow my voice, let me bring you back

[Hook]
