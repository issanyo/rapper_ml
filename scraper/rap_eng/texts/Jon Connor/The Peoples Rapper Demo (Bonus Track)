[Intro]
Yeah
It's Connor
Blue City Club (You know!)
Y'all niggas on that second string shit, this All Varsity no subs, lets go

[Verse 1]
Yo, I rose from the ashes, fire in my eyes
Just singed my eyelashes
I murder every track, what you hearing is the inside view of a casket
That body-bag flow, wrap 'em up, zip the plastic
This Blue City Club shit, realer than you could imagine
Fake niggers show their true colors, that's when we get the clashin'
Fuck the world like it's last name was Kardashian
Cut from a different cloth, see my fabric's in fashion
Birth this Fly City shit, this feels like contractions
All I want to see is green, word to Saint Patrick
Grinding since eleven, they said I was talking craziness
Now niggas hate it like they blame me for their laziness
If you go hard, it's a must I go harder
I spit the shit that got Pookie killed at the Carter
Yes, this is hip-hop, Chris Rock when he hit rock
Trying to walk in my shoes, it'll feel like you runnin' in flip-flops
So much drive, I got no time for a pit stop
Another memorial for Makaveli and Big Pop'
Holding the mic doing the same thing that got B.I.G. shot
Born in the hood, just trying to make sure my kid's not
Somebody told me I'm a walking revolution, so I'mma keep shocking the world
'Til they die from electrocution
Shit, every rhyme in my mind is a execution
Better than the last, each time it's a evolution
Ain't a gangster, ain't a thug, I'm a motherfucking man
I'm real and on my own two feet is where I stand
I'm going out with passion, get ready for the rapture
The one and only, here I stand, The People's Rapper
Conner
