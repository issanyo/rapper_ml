[Verse 1: Caas Swift]
Grindin' like bad breaks touchin' the rotors
Tryina stop mindin' yo' mouth like a motor
Get yo fresh veggies from the grocer I'm Kroger
Diggin' in the grass like a gopher
Niggas snakes step over the cobras
So cold swag on pnemonia-
When you smoke strong the popo gon' smell it
Owned it
I'm from where they whip in the 'yola
Grippin' pistola
And pop any nigga who told 'em
Connor be my right hand that watch my left shoulder
One false move and it's over
Murder the game, now these lames want closure
Bitch I spit that flame and my veins full of ?dojah?
Niggas on that bull, call these muthafuckas dozer
Roll with the squad or get your ass rolled over
And I'll be damned if my mans pulled over-
We gon keep on rollin, then smoke them
Choke them

[Verse 2: Jon Connor]
Turn it up
Play this shit, loud than a muthafuka-
I am from the jungle niggas growlin' in theis muthafucka-
Niggas bussin' shots, not for the sound of that muthafucka-
?Anthony Derail? for every round of that muthafucka-
Niggas gettin' money
And niggas gettin' high
And niggas doin' wrong
But niggas this is life
I shall remain fly
And nigga that that's on my life
So mami don't fuck with me, if you afraid of heights
Blue City nigga we sent
Kill the game and ya'll tryina put that bitch on reset
Hot than a muthafuka they callin' me the devil's reject
So now I'm in Miami in some cargoes and a V-neck
With a bitch that don't speak English in the backseat givin' me neck
Niggas keep sayin' that we next
That's after they givin' me checks
From the school of hard knocks this rap shit feelin' like recess
Niggas talk that hard shit but be softer than a Kleenex
And I am from the city where we tryin' not to be next

[Hook: Jon Connor]
I'm livin' fast
Time is money ballin' 'out is every our past
Livin' everyday like it's my last
Got my mind on my money
They hands in the sky
Take another shot while I rub my hand up her thighs-
Cause you only live once if you gon' do it do it now
???? while my city hold me down-
Two finger salute
To my niggas in the crowd-
And Imma be a real nigga till they put me in the ground-
Nigga what
