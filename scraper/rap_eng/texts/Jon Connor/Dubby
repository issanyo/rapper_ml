[Intro]

[verse 1: Jon Connor]

One of the realist to ever spit it
Bout to lose it but I'm still winning
Niggas say fuck me, they can't touch me
But they still feel it
Im feeling great as i watch these people be fake
If you ain't know me when i was broke
I don't know you now that I'm strait
Strait?
Strait up, my weight up
I run shit, can't wait up
It's fuck y'all, then break up
My head strong, nigga shape up
So what you get outta all that hating you lil pussy boy?
Im so close to the edge, I'm beggin' y'all to push me boy
They got these rappers gassed
My tank on fucking empty
They probably want me gone
But the people keep fucking with me
I know they want me out
But in that i find comfort
I ride for the cause, every track I'm burning rubber
They say: I'm tired of Connor saying how niggas whack
Shit I'm tired of saying it to
The sad part is it's fact
So why don't you tweet your favorite rapper
And tell him learn how to rap
So i can change my subject matter
Till then, love it or change the track
Beyoch!

[Hook:]
Y'all got to deal with me
The people will feel me
The people still with me
I got'em - I got'em
The realist shit is what the really want
I got'em - No problem
So just know where go they follow

[verse2: Jon Connor]
Im the best in the world
When niggas gone say that?
Nigga should've knew that when they heard play back
Niggas hit Sav like: how you ok that?
Told me ko that, RKO that
I get a whole lotta head like the ho got no neck
Walk tight ropes with no net
In other words i don't plan on falling
I'm bout to fuck'em up cause I'm focused
Time to raid for all you cock roaches
Y'all are on my cock open
Wide, cause my drive in four wheel drive
I can't let you slide
When i say I'm the truth man i just being honest
I'm a kill this shit
Thats a threat and a promise
Murder each verse and here's my accomplice
Y'all make way for my nigga Mick Wallace
Gone!

[verse3: Mickey Wallace]
Make way for the wildebeest
Y'all finna get trampled
Move to the side let him through
Cause don't nobody really want to be in the way
When the stampede stomp holes in the game feel the hooves?
This that truth
Everybody looking for
Hunger in the belly industry is looking edible
Turn green for the green
Call me incredible
Choke 'em till they blue and now they want to holler let'em go?
No i won't
Told 'em i don't play those games
When i say i kill mic's I'm serious
Spit it with a vision, I'm a show you the ambition of a rider
Who's drive is fast and furious
Pedal to the floor
Mick go vroom, I see y'all still spinning y'all wheels
Who the hell say they do it better than the dude?
Real talk, y'all tripping like broke heels
That's my word
Anybody want to throw flex at the squad
Then the god got bombs in palm
And the arm so strong
Napalm when i bomb
They gone bring world war three on
This that part, where i yell GETEM
Evident its relevant you see just how i did 'em
Body bag a rapper and whoever coming with him
Im a hock a loogie when they want to hear me spit 'em
(spit sound)
Mick so nasty, but still in time to clean y'all clock
Stay on offense keep making these hits
Till Muhammad and Mohammad call and tell me stop
And at the end of my career
Y'all will give praise for what i did here
This that proof i deliver
Make 'em feel it in they liver
Who you know do it like this here?
Talk to me now!
