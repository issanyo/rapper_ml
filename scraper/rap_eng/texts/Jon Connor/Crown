[Chorus: AdELA]
I pray my throne will ease the fall
Knock me down so I crawl
In the light when darkness called
Came too far to stop me now
No! I never let 'em take my crown, my crown, aye
No! I never let 'em take my crown, my crown, aye

[Verse 1: Royce Da 5'9"]
There was only one time in my life, I bought into the hype
Telling random hoes and their friends, they can all spend the night
Lesson 1, never trust a thot
Never let a critic tell you what you not
Uness they kill you, never fucking stop
Lesson 2, love is hate, hate is the love
They took time outta their day for you even if they rate it a dud
10 in the the morning Kendrick Lamar could put an album in the stores
Twitter gon' call it classic by 10 o' four
How could you skim through greatness
I remember my demo out to get a deal
I'm still out here giving demonstrations
I'm 'bout as insane as Usain when he races
My pen and paper has many faces
It changes from the pain to the shame, daily
So I'm plagued with the same limitations
Been broken so much, I became unbrekable
Basically, what I'm sayin' is I made it where niggas ain't penetrating
Me and titanium tanks is made with the same innovation (Nickle!)

[Chorus: AdELA]
I pray my throne will ease the fall
Knock me down so I crawl
In the light when darkness called
Came too far to stop me now
No! I never let 'em take my crown, my crown, aye
No! I never let 'em take my crown, my crown, aye

[Verse 2: AdELA]
Sitting in that quarter before a century
Mapping these moves mentally
Way I been killing tracks, court order just might sent to me
Mastering my craft, name someone who works as hard as me
Practising these bars, you would think I had a law degree
You're gon' have to pardon me
It's really not in my nature to talk aggresively
This music's been stressing me
Doctor said all this Sodium is not the best for me
Devouring these salty ass rappers, raising my pressure G
It's not a choice for me
Holding on this mic for so long, it's now a part of me
Every time I flow from my soul, give you a piece of me
But all these John Legends saying that they want all of me
But got nothin' to offer me
I'm feeling myself, heard you're feeling me too
Stuck on stupid when I walk by, they don't even need glue
Modern day Cleopatra, bow down
You try to take us out, now we're coming for the crown

[Verse 3: Jon Connor]
They can't defeat 'em , just feed 'em
Y'all in my kingdom, I need 'em
They let me lead 'em, no sequels
I have no equal, there's chemo
For every nigga that say they sick, I beat 'em
'Cuz I had already won when the score was 0 to 0
As a kid, I had high hopes
When my daddy was high broke
Hand on the bible, 'bout to go crazy
That's why I go psycho all over trackz, this is my show
Ain't have no time for a idol
I'm watching ungrateful niggas get to live a life I would die fo
I ain't hidin' for nothing, I'm striving for something
I ain't outta my mind, I ain't blind, see the sky, I can touch it
Fuck it, I just get on my grind when it's seeming the toughest
And I ain't rushing because patience will get you to function
I thank god I ain't out my mind yet
And I still want the world but it ain't mine yet
And no, there ain't no mountain I can't climb yet
So just call me the king, 'cause if I said it, it's gon' be and it's my time, yeah

[Chorus: AdELA]
I pray my throne will ease the fall
Knock me down so I crawl
In the light when darkness called
Came too far to stop me now
No! I never let 'em take my crown, my crown, aye
No! I never let 'em take my crown, my crown, aye
