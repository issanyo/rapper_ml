A lot of these rap niggas perpetrate
Shit bugs me, so I exterminate
A worm before they turn to snakes
Terminate with a turn to fate
Stick your nose in my business
My words a furnace, burn your face
Told me to write a sixteen
I walk out the booth with a murder case
When they ask me to write
It's like they ass getting sliced
With a ax or a knife
Want bars from Connor, you asking for life
It's a sentence in every sentence
What God say about vengeance?
Well, I'll tell you -- it's all mine
I was made in His image
We do numbers, y'all don't put up enough digits to scrimmage
Got balling down to a science
How you gonna fuck with a chemist?
I got a hell of a squad, like I'm surrounded by sinners
You don't want static; my niggas hoping for broken antennas
Fuck you talking about?
Shit, I be knocking them out
Like a lock in a sock to the mouth
Stopping a drought
Spitting that crack
And you letting the cop in the house -- for what?
It don't phase him when evasion is a part of the equation
They can't catch him, I run shit
They can't race him, just chase him
And if I was in your shoes, I wouldn't even lace them
But I had niggas' tongues tied when I'm finished blazing
I'm the Second Coming
Consistently killing verses
Now that's what I call a streak without being naked running
All I see is pussies, and I don't mean a naked woman
So I'm fucking y'all over and I'm enjoying every moment
A moment of silence for this moment of violence
Killing MC's, you'll really be fly when I send your soul to the highest
Ambulances and sirens
I be giving them hell, not just a chance of you dying
Also a chance of you frying
See, they turn to me with urgency
They know that I burn to be for eternity
My firm belief, I'm headstrong and this verse confirm you're weak
So turn your cheek, and wait for your turn to speak
This rap shit is child's play, it's hide-and-seek and you trying to peek
I'm taking a stand at a time
When everybody's still trying to find a seat
The flow is wet, so Sav know I got him when it's time to drop a leak
And every verse is fire, no way that they can compete
This is Lebron, Bosh and Wade, no way they can stop the heat
I tell em vamanos or watch em drop like dominos cause I'mma roast
Anybody that think they coming kinda close til I'm a ghost, fucker
