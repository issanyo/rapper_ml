You really wanna know, how 'bout we start here
First, come from a city that ain't had shit in twenty years
Add the fact that that city is Flint, where niggas get killed
And fight the fact your chances of winning seeming unreal
Fight the fact you got no support from none of your peers
Can only rely on your drive and you never switched gears
Start performing in clubs, you only seen on the news
Not for nothing good, they known for niggas dying in two's
Pouding the pavement while the pavement is pounding you
And still keep a smile like you made it without a bruise
If it's me against the world be expecting the world to lose
I'll show you how to do this, son
How 'bout three grown niggas living in one room
Tryna pay the rent so they barely can pay for food
Never complained once we just took it as paying dues
I'll show you how to do this, son
How 'bout music is your girl, you can't keep a chick
In two years, six different relationships
After a while they all seemin' the same, they sayin' the same shit
Hate that you spit, I say leave out the same door you came in
She say she love you, she gon' try to convince you
But after a while it start to fuck with her mentals
Can't handle the fact your dream is number one and she number two
She feel like you ain't lovin' her back the way that she lovin' you
That's why hoes that can say that I love them is in the few
I'll show you how to do this, son
Go build a crew from the ground up try to weed out the snakes
They leech off the fruits of your labor, shit's sweet they enjoy the taste
They try to poison the apple, see deceit in they face
Hope every nigga is real but for real that's never the case
Watch niggas that run with you they secretly in the race
They hopin' you get erased and he hopin' he take your place
See watch that nigga that's too overly on it
You say that you pissed, this nigga is tryna hold it
Always want credit for old shit
It's annoying, walk around like he own shit but this nigga don't own shit
Point him out quick put that nigga on unemployment
I'll show you how to do this, son
Don't just be better than niggas, be ahead of these niggas
Kill every track like you beheading a nigga
And stand in the cold put your posters up in your town
And let it drive you when you drive by and the tore 'em down
Watch local niggas about as hard as they watch you
Smile when they think you don't know they will sabotage you
Play they little game keep lettin' 'em think they got you
And watch the look on they face when you in the 'hood just to stop through
I'll show you how to do this, son
Now as I continue to shit on every track that I get on
Meaning that I will piss on any toilet you sit on
Eatin' these rap niggas, I bit bone till they hit home
Punchlines have you chin gone and then replacing your hip bone
I spit that heat that'll burn and'll turn your skin tone
Second string-ass niggas
I'll show you how to do this, son
