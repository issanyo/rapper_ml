[Verse 1]
I got the soul of a veteran, anti medicine
The flow is sicker than it's ever been, it's evident
I kill shit nigga, hear the evidence
Better tell 'em it's that shit that make 'em question nigga's relevance
The Doc's had me on my ass, had a chip on my shoulder ever since
I make hits niggas flinch, you would move if you had better sense
Ill since birth and it got better since
I'm a real nigga so this probably out ya element
You the realest when you tellin' it
I can't buy the bullshit no more, everybody sellin' it
So I close shop on you hoes, and the hoes flock, man
It's street till I'm thrown, I put on for the whole block, rock
Niggas is gassed up
Niggas think they hot when it's just me burnin they ass up
Niggas is bitches like they Mrs. with they ass up
Gettin' fucked, Moe Cleze with my glass up
I give a fuck if my mindset like a flying jet, I'm on my fly shit
A pilot, Cuz my shit, got the hunger of a B.I.G. that ain't been signed yet
And you could feel that
Where you been is where you still at, so nigga kill that
My shit is red hot, like red dot, on your temple
Respect a young god in the temple
Should I continue? Nothing like a good ass whoppin' to convince you!
I love it

Now I know why Don King felt in the corner of Mike Tyson
Now I know how Phil Jackson felt going into the Finals with Michael Jordan
Bringin that real shit back get your hands up high
That real shit back, put your hands up high!
Put 'em high (x8)

[Verse 2]
Yo
When I spit I have 'em strung out
That's why I see alot of long faces like I'm lookin in the mirrors at a funhouse
Get it clear, I don't rap for rappers
Honestly, you niggas is all ass, word to Esther Baxter
And Y'all niggas extra average on your best day
On the regular my worst verse kill competitors
You sentimental? We in the jungle, got that venom in 'em
The flow is bananas that's just the gorilla in him
How you love that? Show it to me, I show you love back
But I ain't stuntin' none of you niggas so nigga fuck that
Opposition, I know you pissed but I grew up without a pot to piss in
So far as me this ain't a competition
This death and livin', ain't the stakes high?
While you roll snake eyes, I'm lookin' in these snakes eyes
Tryin' not to bite the apple, but Adam I feel you
Ass naked hoes in my face, I ain't thinking clear too
Industry shady it need to be taken over
Tryin to give you that raw, you snorting that baking soda
Well the wait is over, it's like I do magic
I'm spittin' that blue magic, Abracado faggot
And truthfully, if you don't like it, nigga sue me
Cuz Nas told me fuck ya'll niggas and just do me
Ain't gotta like it, but ya'll gon' respect it
Hope you got the message, this is epic

Bringin that real shit back get your hands up high
That real shit back, put your hands up high!
Put 'em high (x8)
