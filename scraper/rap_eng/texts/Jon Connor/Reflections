[Hook: Mavelle]
All these so-called friends hangin' around
Suddenly, they all wanna be down
Oh yea, you heard about me?
Well, I heard about me too
Been knowin' this dope shit
Tell me where the fuck were you?
Oh, you just couldn't see
What was always so clear to me
I saw what I was meant to be
Even through a broken mirror

[Verse 1: Suspect]
I walk barefoot through this concrete jungle
I stand tall, I was taught key structures
I took off just to watch them bug me
In this loft, cuz the view so lovely
It's beautiful, but what the streets do to you is ugly
My tracks laced, I'm just here plain' rugby
My shoes laced & everybody wanna bump me
I see your face tearin', you wanna hug me
I'm hungry
Now my shows out in Hungary
I'm a shepherd
Just got my cattle
I'm so goddamn proud of my shadow
He always got my back
From life to tracks, it don't matter
Only God good enough to get tatted
So many niggas I love got subtracted
That's a lot more success gettin' added
Separate myself from being average
Used to practice
Now what I practice?
Is makin' magic
Set my mind on it & got to have it
I live by the law of attraction
I see how you live & see the status
You don't do shit, you in the bathroom
Project housing, living like Bousim
Trying to live in this castle
Live like the present, I'm trying to past you
You say I'm nuts, but I'm getting cashews (cash you)..
Sittin' on ya ass, livin' off ya mom & dad
I'm tryin' to help my mom, what's wrong with that?
Is John featuring Jon really the strongest rap?
Somewhere down the line we went wrong with rap...

[Verse 2: Jon Connor]
Just think about this  dream I chase
Think about every opposition I faced
Every fake friend that would sit in my face
And really they was hoping they could get in my place
Thinkin' they was down for the cause, but really they was the cause of the downfall
Cold-hearted like I seen the shadow on a ground hog
Watch who you let around y'all
Cuz the ones that's sayin' they will go to war for you, wouldn't let a round off
SOUND OFF..

(pause)

They got me at attention
Imagine divisions causin' division
Imagine you losin a kinship
Is the music and money worth more than a friendship?
Who knows?
Time will tell
I guess every rhyme I sell
Is the equivalent to time in jail
Cuz I'm trapped behind these bars like they hide my flaws
The shit gets hard
It's like being behind a cell

(pause)

Quittin' ain't an option
I'm a concrete rose and I blossom
I don't ever say "die," don't even play opossum
Hard work, is haven' faith in let tin' God work

The studio is Holy Grail, this is our church
Paint a picture with these lyrics, this is artwork
Before you get it, gotta learn to play your part first
You gotta fight through the tears
If it takes years
Know it can't end right here
This is only the beginning
If you ready and you're willing
Then you can get it
When you winning, you can fell it
Fake friends, let 'em go by the wayside
And you gotta let the past be the past
Keep join' until you can't no more
And enjoy it for as long as it lasts
