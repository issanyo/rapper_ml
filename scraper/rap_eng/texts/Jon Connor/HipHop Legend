(It's JP on da Track)

[Verse 1: Chris Webby]
Yeah, I'm feelin' like a Hip-Hop legend
When I'm steppin' in the session
Only time I lift this mic's to be the best in my profession
Only time I see a rival's when I'm checkin' my reflection
Anytime I see my rival I say "Damn, that kid is handsome."
I ain't never been no thug
I use this pencil as a weapon
And when I get to writin', you'll need medical attention
All these loyal listeners is what I measure my success in
But in the conversation I don't ever get a mention
But it's cool, I paid my dues
And to my fans, I'm still that dude
I get no press, but I make my moves
And I own my music unlike you
And I seen a bunch of these rappers that seem to be bubblin' faster
But they don't be stackin' like Webby be stackin'
I follow my pub in a master's
I'm doublin' up while they hustlin' backwards
I'm just one of hundreds of rappers
But now I have carved my own lane, that I'm livin' in brilliant rugged, resilient, flippin' middle fingers up to the system
So fuck your opinion!
Sippin' my whiskey with a little skinny bitty, with a butt that's Brazilian
And got a pretty Sicilian up in my kitchen that's cooking and servin' me chicken
And that's just perks of the job I guess, but I digress
Cause I am just
So out of here that I'm Elon Musk
In a full space suit with a flight to catch
You never seen a sight so fresh
When I jump on stage and I do my thing
Built my castle now I'm king, kiss the ring

[Hook: Chris Webby]
Yeah I'm feelin' like a Hip-Hop legend
I been underground for now, but shit been spreadin'
Maybe not the guy that they usually mention
But let 'em sleep, while I creep
To the top, I'm a beast
Yeah I'm feelin' like a Hip-Hop legend
A motherfucking Hip-Hop legend
Maybe not the guy that they usually mention
But while they sleep
I get better every week, then repeat

[Verse 2: JAG]
Webby did hit me to come through and body it
Told me to dunk it
'Cause he bout to lobby it
I just be walking 'round, feeling like Jordan
'Cause none of them niggas can tell you where Scottie is
I don't be doing this shit for the audience
Niggas be hating, I'm losing the weight
But look at the clothes that are fitting my body
And look like I'm working, I'm getting it, K
Come at me crooked, I'm getting it straight
Mannequin Challenge: you niggas is fake
Niggas that don't know that I'm rolling it loud
And outperforming, you niggas is late
Screw them niggas, screw the rest, screw the figures, screw the checks
Shoot the Tec, shoot his chest, shoot his legs, shoot his neck
Who the kill, who the best? (JAG)
Long grind nigga, get to work
Killer being, tell 'em get the hearse
I very seldom do features, yeah
'Cause niggas dying when they get the verse
Have a nigga laying with the dirt
This nigga ill, better get the nurse
I done killed so many niggas' beats
Gotta pray to God when I get to church
Get out you phonies and nigga I'm through
None of you niggas can get on my crew
Back in the days, I was up on the block
Handled the rock on my Skip to My Lou
You know how I do
Look how I come with the latest
Feel like the one that just made it
Bet you I'm faded, I know these niggas gon' hate it

[Hook: Chris Webby]
Yeah I'm feelin' like a Hip-Hop legend
I been underground for now, but shit been spreadin'
Maybe not the guy that they usually mention
But let 'em sleep, while I creep
To the top, I'm a beast
Yeah I'm feelin' like a Hip-Hop legend
A motherfucking Hip-Hop legend
Maybe not the guy that they usually mention
But while they sleep
I get better every week, then repeat

[Verse 3: Jon Connor]
Look
I been through hell and back
Niggas be getting deals and don't be getting they money
But they ain't 'gon tell you that
You buying the bullshit that industry niggas be talking and hope you can sell it back
For beginners, I'll give you some wisdom
Look, life is a trip and you fell for that
Well I was trapped in the cell, I'm back
Quit, I'm like, "Never that!"
Everyday another rapper coming up and wanna talk about it, how they got a million dollars
But they never wanna talk about the drama that's behind it, never mind it
'Cause you'd rather this than just go back to the hood, just be quiet
Everybody had that little fantasy, I mean they had that little rapper dream
About the day that they gonna be on every magazine, but never had a team
Never had management
Get money now they don't know how to manage it
(Wait)
I know it sound complicated, but to be in your top 5 conversation
There's way too much confrontations about being properly compensated
Business and art
Yeah, that's a hell of a combination
And fakeness is not how my momma raised me
So I ain't expecting no nomination
Me and fuck niggas do not get along
Think that I care about comments, you wrong
Fuck it, I love it, these rappers is puppets
I'm watching these labels just string you along
Saying that you balling, but you need a loan
Don't believe words, I believe what I'm shown
Don't fall into debt man, it's better to own
And I'ma stay real like it's written in stone
I'ma be great to the ones that I'm grateful
You ain't gotta like me, and I ain't tryna make you
I'ma stay humble, I'ma stay grateful
If you fuck with me then I'ma say, "Thank you"
If you ain't strong in this game, it'll break you
I give a fuck about a list or how they raised you
I'ma legend to the ones who was faithful
