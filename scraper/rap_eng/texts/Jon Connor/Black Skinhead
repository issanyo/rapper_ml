[Intro]
(I am the best in the world at what I do)
Yeah!
AVM
Aftermath
Y'all know what time it is, let's go

[Verse 1]
It's the return of the genius
Ego probably as big as my penis
Yo girl probably seen it
These rappers is wack and sound like they can barely speak english
These niggas sound stupid and you just consume it
Confusing with music, the fuck is you doing?
Y'all sound like duh duh duh duh duh
If it wasn't the truth then it might be amusing, look
They say I'm the voice of the people
That mean that I speaking no evil
They tell me that life is a bitch
Well I'm cool with the shit as long as she deep throat
Don't follow the leader, just go be a leader
Some people ain't think cos they eat what you feed em
Accept how you treat 'em
Cause they too scared to rock the boat, damn I miss Aaliyah
Linin' up to see Connor get busy
I just want y'all to feel me, just want y'all to feel how I felt when I used to be listenin' to biggie or 2Pac or Timbaland, Missy or Weezy
A mixtape from 50, well fuck it
DMX with some production from Swizzy
Shit was authentic
Go figure cause niggas was rich but they spit like they ain't have a penny

[Hook]
I miss the basement, rap city
I miss big lips and big titties
I miss big lips and big titties
Rap fucking sucks, see the hickies?
Ananda Lewis, I thought she was pretty
She 40, I fuck her, she feel like she 60
And that's of a quickie cause shit I ain't picky
Wait we ain't get too far of the subject did we?

[Interlude]
(I am the best in the world at what I do
I am the best in the world at what I do
Best in the world)

[Verse 2]
Best in the world, yeah that's me, definitely destiny
Destined to progress I'm the chef peep the recipe
How can I see? Top of the heat balling I'm dreaming
'Bout knock on the door lock on the door
How y'all gon keep me out?
I keep it 150 nobody fucking with me
Go in 'til the 'mo empty, spit like I'm still Indie
Rise to the occasion, recognize my location
Jeopardize, nigga don't try I am not for the fake shit
I am not finna go basic, have my talents wasted
I came outta my basement with a dream I'm gon chase it

[Outro]
Man that's it man..(hah)
(Best in the world)
