[Intro]
Listen to me, learn from me
I wasn't the best because I killed quickly
I was the best because the crowd loved me
Win the crowd, and you'll win your freedom
I will win the crowd
I'll give them something they've never seen before

[Verse 1: Jon Connor]
Look, I ain't play games, homie, I ain't got time
Especially when I do this for my homies that done got time
Imma do this for the city, every hot line
Go to every block, every hood, every corner, every stop-sign
I just wanna get it for the days that I was living in the hood
Wait a minute, I don't even know if you can call it living
Pay attention, cause at any given minute
You be chilling with your niggas and be witness to a killing, hold up
Grew up on the north side, north side
Nigga to the fullest, I was quicker than a bullet
That was going past the window, it's all or nothing
So I'm coming for the crown, what the fuck you think I'm here for?
Make no mistake about it, fake shit I can't allow it
Trapped in this game, now I can't get out it
You want that real shit, and I feel the same about it
I was in the trenches just like you
Wondering how the fuck Imma get through
I don't have a plan, but I know one thing:
Gotta get up out of this motherfucker, and I can't lose
Eyes on the prize, and I know I can't quit
Never gonna fail, so I'm on my shit
Gotta keep going and I can't look back
Took on the world and now it's on my back, back
Back up, homie, don't act up
I'm from Fly City where this rap shit really ain't a factor
And when them killers on your back and make a
Motherfucking backpacker pack up
On some other shit, them was the odds I was up against
So I ain't phased by none of this
Cause in reality, I love that shit
For all the grinding I was doing, I ain't no one you was fucking with

[Bridge]
See, I've been on my hustle for a minute
Now it's really time to get it
So it's only fair I'm letting them know
That I'm a motherfucking animal, it's true
You don't want me coming for you
Just sit back and keep enjoying the show, cause yo

[Hook]
You don't really want it, nah
(Come and step to the floor, you already know
That I'm too cold with the microphone
I'm beastmode, better leave it alone)
You don't really want it, nah
(Cause I came too far to stop
Regardless I’m off the wall, chip off the block
I’m a monster, watch bitch, better call the cops)

[Verse 2: Snow Tha Product]
Welcome to the Hunger Games
You give up your whole life but get tons of fame
There's rappers who don't write but get companies
Making offers with their souls for a chuck of change
I got more profits than those, y'all so dumb to chase
But they popped off all the time, but they a bum today
Man I got the Glock that I told Nicky tuck your chain
You see my pockets is gordo, you chubby chase?
I got a plot to take over this continent
While I'm over-thinking, all these bitches are there gossiping
So Imma take a spliff, take a hit, something monstrous
Cause I really quit but I think I've been locked in
And all this bullshit and I'm sick of the politics
I'm gonna show you which really bitch but it's obvious
All of these hoes really want to just party and molly
And violence and bottles and popping and dropping
And opposite that is just me, I'm here taunting them
All they admire us, not in that guapa shit
Alternately, I think I'm gonna stop the gig
Talk to them, all bitches wearing this God-given
Oculus urge of confidence
I’m just subconsciously trying to make all y'all get y'all bitches
Hearing my shit but I'm not spitting anymore lessons
Man do as you wish , i ain’t gon' stress
Man, you finna get little Mrs Snow from '08 where I spit
All about selling drugs and the things that I did
Cause I done sell 'tapes and I toured
And I ripped all these stages from East to the West
And these kids and these magazine covers just don't give a shit
What the fuck? You want Product? I'll give you a fix this is it

[Bridge]
See, I've been on my hustle for a minute
Now it's really time to get it
So it's only fair I'm letting them know
That I'm a motherfucking animal, it's true
You don't want me coming for you
Just sit back and keep enjoying the show, cause yo

[Hook]
You don't really want it, nah
(Come and step to the floor, you already know
That I'm too cold with the microphone
I'm beastmode, better leave it alone)
You don't really want it, nah
(Cause I came too far to stop
Regardless I’m off the wall, chip off the block
I’m a monster, watch bitch, better call the cops)

[Verse 3: Chris Webby]
C-Webby be carnivorous, bars rippin', shit
I'm the boss, people be calling me Sarge in this bitch
Make a mess, gotta keep a fucking tarp and a whip
As I keep evolving, just like Darwin predicts
So it's off with his head and I'm off with his chick
Keep it calm till I flip, then I'm off in this bitch
Fuck Dawn of the Dead
Shit I got grown men hiding under their bed
Thinking that monster exist
Cooking up that east coast dough
With a pad and a pen and the words that I wrote
Every syllable invented that's enclosed and in quotes
Are too complex for most folk, but you know
I'm a ghost in the booth, can't see me though
Hard body with the flow, C3PO
Lost track of all the fucking Sour D we rolled
So high, Major Tom can’t reach me bro (Shh)
Yo it's Major Tom and, you don't really want it
So everyone can suck my dick without a condom on it
I'm just full of that chronic, gin no tonic
Couple capsules in my pocket
Know I'm gonna rock it, feeling so right
Going psychotic, they feeling my rhymes
Sipping Hpnotiq, and I'm losing my mind
Roll back another time cause I'm just a...
Motherfucker with the coldest flow
CT to the Poconos, you better hold the phone
Before you leave with a broken nose
I'm so dope that I think I'm 'bout to overdose
Now I'm feelin' like I'm really 'bout to go the road
That ain't chose by most men, so I go alone
Into the dark side
How could I have sold my soul?
I never had one, bitch! Motherfucker, let's go!

[Bridge]
See, I've been on my hustle for a minute
Now it's really time to get it
So it's only fair I'm letting them know
That I'm a motherfucking animal, it's true
You don't want me coming for you
Just sit back and keep enjoying the show, cause yo

[Hook]
You don't really want it, nah
(Come and step to the floor, you already know

(Cause I came too far to stop
Regardless I’m off the wall, chip off the block
I’m a monster, watch bitch, better call the cops)
