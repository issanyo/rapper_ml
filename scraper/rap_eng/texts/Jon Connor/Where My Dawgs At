Where my dawgs at?
Where my dawgs at?
Yeah, uh, look

[Verse]
I'm not a hater I just acknowledge the garbage
I'm probably the only nigga with nuts enough to be honest
The music getting so tarnished, it make me wanna be Amish
I'm 'bout to bring home the bacon, you niggas looking Islamic
You ain't sick cause your music make me wanna vomit
That's the fruits of Biggie and Pac labour is fucking rotten
We sit back watching, that's why I'm talking that shit again
Who woulda knew the Second Coming was coming from Michigan
They're like ''Here Connor go, starting with the hate''
No mothafucka I'm hoping I'm starting a debate
Should buy an apartment in your state
And put a target on your face
For every starving artist who appalled
By the garbage that you make
Words so sharp that I hope it leave a scar on your face
Pass y'all by far like a man versus a car in a race
Don't play games with me cause every card is an Ace
I was a heavy nigga, hungry, I done starved my way into shape
Ha, the shit is funny right?
But tell 'Ye I'm still tryna get my money right
But check the science
Niggas get gassed, they be mothafuckin' trash
So when a nigga be aight, y'all saying the shit is tight
Look, standards of rap then dropped so low
That nobody really know who got flow no more, fuck!
The rap game stinks cause we just sit by and let shit fly
Look mofucka I'm nice
I can't rap dumb or act dumb
I just try harder to make you smarter
See, the niggas y'all keep saying is good
Is making every nigga wanna go and rap in the hood
And they 'bout sound the same so he thinking he should
Cause he might blow and what's sad is he actually could
Shit is scary, rap videos looking like parodies
Snapping like ???? fuck who tryna compare to me
Nah, I've adjusted that knowing you can't fuck with
The shit that I come up with my tongue is a gun bustin'
Killing y'all, you think you on top until the ceiling fall
My shit is authentic the shit you spitting ain't real at all
Dawg, you 'bout to get mauled by Godzilla claws
You niggas is drowning what happens when you chase a waterfall
Now it's like opinions is not allowed
You niggas gon make me turn into Star and get Buckwild
I'm the, passionate advocate never seen him so adamant
The damage I cause punching lines will have you in bandages
You niggas tell tall tales like a giraffe's ass
Tryna school you niggas and do numbers like it's math class
Friday the 13th dodge your girl ????
Keep playing your trash ass get stuffed in a Gladbag
I throw these combinations to spark a conversation
This is heart in the game got cardiac complications
Agree or disagree, this is me
Just tryna have substance in the legacy I leave
And from the jump Sav and Moe just told me to kill shit
And let 'em know that Connor is somethin' they gotta deal with
