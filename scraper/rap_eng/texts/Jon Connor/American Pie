[Verse 1: Jon Connor]
Come with me if you will, if I could take you back in time
Back in high school, hitting skins was the only thing on my mind
Eleventh grade, boy, you couldn't tell me shit, I was in my prime
Moms blocking your cell phone, tired of girls tying up the line
I mean, I spent so much time trying to get ass and, yeah, I did
I think back, I thank the Lord, I wasn't ready to have no kid
I'm on the phone till five in the morning, knowing I gotta get up early for class
Mama said I need to slow down, but I told her all these girls so fast
Look, all these girls so fine, all these girls got to be mine
So many times I said, "It's only you," knowing damn-well I was lying
Saying, "I love you," and, "It's just you," I ain't even gotta touch you
Running that game, nah, girl, I ain't even tryna rush you
I ran into this chick I used to hit, aw yeah, she was bad
Now she got five babies, four baby-daddies, yo, this shit's sad
Now I think back to them times I used to make an empty promise
I think, "Is this my fault?" Shit's just weight on my conscious, for real

The weather changes winds, they blow
Sun will shine amidst the snow
If only chose how we fall
It'd be too easy to brush it off
So it ends, and it begins
So it ends, and it begins
So it ends, and it begins
So it ends...

[Verse 2: Jon Connor]
Beauty is her gift, and her beauty is her curse
Look, between home and school, she don't know which one is worse
Every nigga tryna hit it so she don't know what she worth
When she gave it to her first, he went around saying he hit it first
Now, picture that, now she bitter
Her daddy used to hit her
Yeah, nigga had a temper
Used to get touched on by the babysitter
All that shit's still in her
But we ain't tripping, we just walk on by
Wave when we say hi
But what's inside, made her use her bathroom breaks to go and cry
We don't ask, so she don't tell, so she figures nobody cares
Teen years have us isolated thinking nobody there
Insecure about what to wear
She hates the person that's in the mirror
But as a teen, all we seen was light skin with pretty hair
Teachers used to think that she was fast, all cos of how she looked
But jealousy don't stop just cos they grown, you'll learn that in no book
Her beauty was a burden
On the inside, she was still hurting
Never found herself and now she grown and still searching
It was...

[Verse 3: Jon Connor]
She had posters all on her wall
Of her favourite artists, she'd call
Her girl to pick her up when she want to go catch niggas down at the mall
Don't judge a book by its cover
I say judge a book by the authour
What no God is there if my father
Wanna go hit the club with his daughter
Daughter probably 'bout just as lost, she ain't got no chance
Just a victim of circumstance
None of this shit was in the plans
Nah, not still living at home with her moms
Not get knocked up by no slob
Niggas spend all day playing 2K, ain't thinking about no job
They say, "Girl, getchu an athlete," like that mentality helps
She takes all kinds of abuse, dude, she don't know how to fend for herself
Her mouth will tell you all kind of lies, but her eyes will tell you the truth
Behind that pretty face, there's so much pain that we never knew
And that's... Real!
