[Hook]
Fuck you, I ain't trippin', my clique still poppin'
These niggas still hatin', these bitches still watchin'
Bitch niggas cockblockin', but can't fuck with my regime
Screaming "Fuck the world" like it's the baddest bitch I ever seen
They hearing bow bow bow
At a nigga front door they hearin' bow bow bow
At a nigga front door they hearin' bow bow bow
At a nigga front door they hearin' buck buck buck

[Verse 1]
I got the hood saying "Aftermath, Aftermath"
Ain't nothing after that
Fly city, when a nigga jump stupid they beat your rabbit ass
Break it down homie, I'm dope, nigga this Breaking Bad
Hate that I made it, hate on these nuts with your hatin' ass
Had dreams of killin' this shit, sleep in my Jason mask
Want hot, I'm givin' 'em hell, the preacher can't save his ass
God flow, punchlines is whoopin' Satan ass
Bow bow bow at a nigga front door
They hearin' crack music, niggas can't kill my high
You ain't killin' these lines, niggas killin' my time
And Kendrick, these bitch ass niggas is killin' my vibe, oh
Niggas got comfortable and made they self at home
Niggas done kicked they feet up
So this shit gotta feel like buck at a nigga's front door, hello

[Hook]
Fuck you, I ain't trippin', my clique still poppin'
These niggas still hatin', these bitches still watchin'
Bitch niggas cockblockin', but can't fuck with my regime
Screaming "Fuck the world" like it's the baddest bitch I ever seen
They hearing bow bow bow
At a nigga front door they hearin' bow bow bow
At a nigga front door they hearin' bow bow bow
At a nigga front door they hearin' buck buck buck

[Verse 2]
I got the hood saying "Aftermath, Aftermath"
Ain't nothing after that
Stupid whore, you only get one shot then I'm gon' break the glass
Make it hit, we making hits with your average ass
You disappoint me like the baddest bitch with an average ass
(Go) And just what we needed, that niggas get heated
The reason for niggas competing, to kill it, to murder it
'Till the beat started bleeding
And that nigga featured ain't breathin'
Take it or leave and if you can't beat it
You left with a feeling of feeling defeated
The writing's on the wall
But you niggas is blind as if you want us fuckers to read it
I hear no evil I don't hear you trash niggas
I'm here to win, you all happy be a has niggas
I want a ring just doing my thing ass niggas
I'm focused, peep the weakness in the rap game is over, ah

[Hook]
Fuck you, I ain't trippin', my clique still poppin'
These niggas still hatin', these bitches still watchin'
Bitch niggas cockblockin', but can't fuck with my regime
Screaming "Fuck the world" like it's the baddest bitch I ever seen
They hearing bow bow bow
At a nigga front door they hearin' bow bow bow
At a nigga front door they hearin' bow bow bow
At a nigga front door they hearin' buck buck buck
