[Verse 1]
Look where we headed
Niggas want baby mamas instead of weddings
Then holla ‘’she crazy’’, you knew that before you got her pregnant
Visualise the dream of Malcolm and Martin opposite
We all God’s children making the Devil’s adoption list
Free will, keep up with rioting
Our common sense born without a conscience
But over time we building up our tolerance
Immunity to scrutiny, that’s just how the world turn
Alfred told me ‘’some people just want to watch the world burn’’
Ashes to ashes after flashes of decisions made
The world disintegrates as shallowness takes center stage
As I pen this page some will say I’m a renegade
Cleaning out my closet, I’m just man enough to renovate
Seduction of corruption got us all fucked
Before we all stuck, see the light before you all struck
Back to that baby mama, nigga here your little boy come
Lifetime to build a future, only seconds to destroy one

[Interlude]
Uh, we just getting warmed up, uh, uh huh
Getting warmed up

[Verse 2]
The young Jedi, so fly, I skywalk
I talk for the hood, police sirens, I line chalk
My whole crew get down, I can't stand you, sit down
We drop bombs, I advise you get down
See y'all make believe, I make believers
These niggas is cakes, we cake receivers
In other words you niggas sweet, I run sugar hill
Hello fellow I’m remellow love how could it feel
Fuck a hater ‘cause it’s all or nothing
My reflex D-X, tell the public to suck it
I got niggas sweatin’, plottin’ on how to stop me
It’s useless to cop, be a jock me, you not me
There’s more game to soak up
Niggas been sleeping and so I’m so glad you woke up
Watch ‘em get choked up
Nigga, fuck that I spit crack like your watch and break the dope up
Well shit, all your hopes up
Deluxe sucker, don’t fuss, nigga fuck you
I fuck  your bitch to show you that your girl’s a dumb slut
Young slut, better get it right, you better get it right
I fucked her so hard it be hard for her to sit at night
Well shit, my nigga, I don’t know how y’all even breathin’
I don’t know how y’all even leavin’
I don’t know how you could call us Even Steven
My nigga, I call you Steve and y'all won't leave, y'all buggin’ me
Y’all niggas can’t fuck with me, this about to get ugly
Luckily y’all better put me in a whole 'nother category
Nigga's category
I might play with y’all, might play a game with y’all
It ain’t no thing, but all y’all might fall
I ball like I was sponsored by Spalding
You all in? I don’t think so
Well, fuck that, I drink slow
I take it all in, y’all spittin’ that poison
And where I’m going you boys ain’t went
But fuck that, nigga, my flow so dark it’s hundred percent tints
Maybe zero percent tints, no matter how y’all call it
Nigga, fuck that, y’ll know how we do, you all fallin’
And all y’all retarded if you ever try to test me
Street smarts, my nigga, this Wayne Gretzky
Iced up, well fuck it we can put that away
But nigga fuck it I ball so hard that I could put Shaq away
Or nigga Hardaway, I might just get this the harder way
And nigga fuck that, reach in your soul, take your heart away
Dawg, y’all don’t really want it with the God
Well shit, y’all, uh, done level past after trash
I’m the level at Aftermath that reach greatness
Y’all niggas hatin’, y’all be on some snake shit
Ya’ll be on some fake shit, this shit be the greatness
This shit be the greatest shit you ever heard
That’s my word
