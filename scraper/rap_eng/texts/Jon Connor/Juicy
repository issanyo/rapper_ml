[Verse 1: Jon Connor]
Who would have ever knew, I'm doing shit most people said I would never do
Said never lose, and now I'm generating revenue
I'm from a place where we don't dream, because if you dream
That means you sleep, and if you sleep that means you just might not wake up
Now check it, impossible was something that we heard often
Walking a thin line between life and death can get exhausting
Mama cooking chicken, I was playing "It Was Written"
I had a vision of spitting with the way that I'm gonna get it
Listen how we grew up wasn't the flyest
Inspired by what we see on TV because we didn't have enough bread to buy it
Excited to go outside and act like the people we admired
Fake no limit chain around my neck, you see me shining
We bump "Make Em Say Uhh", rolling dice on the corner
Nigga make em say uhh, Landon Street raised me
The fame will never change me
No matter how crazy life seems to be getting for me lately I still ride
For the same shit that I always did, maintained the same life that I always lived,  same folks that was down when I didn't have a penny
Still with me, just know Flint city still in me, I used to read XXL and The Source
Now I'm on them same pages, guess natures taking its course
My little cousins looking up to me now, used to be chubby or ugly
Now light-skinned bitches want to fuck with me now, its kind of crazy how the world turns
Wasn't concerned with material, just wanted to read comic books and eat cereal, serious
Maybe write a couple rhymes and be respected as a lyricist, and make a difference
To the folks who be hearing this, writing rhythms on the porch
All the other kids heading to the basketball court, I guess its just a feeling
When its in you, don't ignore it, rapping was my passion, its my first and last resort
No back and forth, Ive seen a light at the end of the tunnel, as it was caving in
Door steady closing, I know I barley made it in, made amends with every obstacle
As I was paying dues, I ain't dead and I ain't in jail, and a Flint nigga made the news, what?
Somebody lying, nah, what I am is a result of somebody trying
I'm from a city where its always somebody crying, and we get numb to the pain
Its always somebody dying, its never more than we can handle
Ain't got nothing to put up on our mantle
Now I'm in the position to be an example
They said "you from Flint, you ain't ever gonna blow"
Well If you don't know, now you know, nigga
