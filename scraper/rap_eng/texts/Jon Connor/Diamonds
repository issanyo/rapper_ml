[Verse 1: Jon Connor]
I ain't got no ego, I'm the voice of the people, started at zero
In the hood they say the chance of us getting out, is the size of a peephole
As bad as I wanted to eat though, I ain't never gone freeload
Tryin' to run rap, we swore, niggas on my dick deep throat
Jealousy is the cancer you niggas need chemo
Dope shit, kilo, that shit that niggas OD on
Kill shit don't be no hero
Bruce Wayne, die over loose change
Be the like who say when the truth came
Point blink I'm the shit you a poo stain
Get only at the top with a few chains
Look, you wanna be rich, and lonely, your broken friends will live both the peers, pimp one fo' sho', I know
When I started out I wanted to blow dough
With friends, perception
Is a weapon had your homeboys second guessing
But in that is a lesson, don't make a friendship in investment
And that's real

[Hook: Justin Daye]
That's real life, do what I feel like
Feel whatever I feel like
Only if it feel right, uh
We on now running past the stop sign
You better keep yours, cause you know I got mine
That's real life, do what I feel like
Feel whatever I feel like
Only if it feel right, uh
Late nights, early morn's
Rap life, I'm letting 'em know what we own

[Verse 2: Jon Connor]
I spend every minute on getting on, so if you thought I was quit, wrong
Timeless that's what my mind is on, y'all have a run that was fifteen minutes long
I'm trying to steal these charts, saw the pinnacle as a criminal
It's from Rosies at the Grammys, did your name come out of that envelope
Cause it's torture trying to live out the fruits of your labor
But can't make it to the arching, patience is a virtue, so don't force it, enforce it
I get lost like I'm law enforcement, to make my fortune cause being broke is torment
They say time is money, that's why I put every minute, every second in recording
To come so far that you can't turn back, and wouldn't turn back even if you could
Took my time when I wrote these raps, now I think back on the time it took
I feel trapped who to change these locks, got this mic so the world just watch
Is what it is and you can't be shot, you wanna be your own now the ship won't stop
Gave my all and as she handed, and I never once panicked, times I was feeling abandoned
So when he fanned that I got, I don't take it for granted
You get everything you want, but it's never how you planned it
Know where you tryin' to go before you blow a lost mind end up stranded

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Brandon Bars]
Look, so little time to do it all, what if I call I know she ready
Time zone on time zone I know it's fast, Richard Perry, let me take you to a place
Where you can break with all eleven, get in through more minutes you only see
Photos like a brass sky, lights be flashing
People be asking and all this shit you seem to know
Shots of passion, know what happened, if when out the story's told
What. Take it back, you never thought that far that you would go
Alcohol for therapy oh yes we ventured that Patron
This is all see I'm just fresh as I can be, I'm like the ripest of the tree
Yes I'm so fly I view the sky, as a cloudy canopy
And I don't lust 'em I don't trust 'em, they always asking can we be
Take that as compliments, it contemplate, it's after who I be see
I just wrote the verse how I see, in my zone with a stressed on b
I'm so related and over hated, that all alone is the best relief
I know just what they want, so am I wrong for that advantage
Steady living in the moment so I can't even understand it

[Hook]
