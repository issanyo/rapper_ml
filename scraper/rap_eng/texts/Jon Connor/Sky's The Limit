[Intro: Jon Connor]
Good evening ladies and gentlemen
How's everybody doing tonight?
I'd like to welcome to the stage, the lyrically acclaimed
I like this young man, because he calls himself "The people's rapper", I like that
So everybody in the house, give a warm round of applause
For Jon Connor, everybody give it up for "The People's Rapper"
Jon Connor

[Verse 1: Jon Connor]
Let's talk about my nigga Lil Joe from down the street
The hood would tease him cause he had braces on his teeth
Wasn't never scared to say that was my best friend
Too keep it real that was my right and my left hand
Took me with him when he got his first kiss
He wanted me to see him
Because if he said he kissed a girl, nobody would believe him
We out on our bikes, shit sneaking every weekend
Ass whoppings from my mama
We ain't tell him we was leaving to Misfits
Always together, in the mischiefs
Fuck it, love the trouble, only made a stronger friendship
Then we got into it, fell out over some kid shit
Never got to say I'm sorry, that's something I got to live with
He always felt alone, parents was never home
And now on top of that one of his best friends was gone
He gave me my first mic, when I decided to write
He took his own life, I cry to sleep every night
Now who gon' tell me that success ain't come with a prize?
Sky's the limit

[Bridge: Biggie Smalls]
Biggie Smalls is the realest person in the game
The realest person, I mean
You would feel like, there's nothing you'd have to hide from him, because he's just a real, he's real, you know what I'm saying
You can tell me anything, and I can tell you anything
You know, I don't bite my tongue for anyone, you know what Im saying, I just keep it a hundred percent

[Verse 2: Jon Connor]
I say a prayer every morning for my nigga Mini
Shit, he probably believed in me more than anybody
I was always humble, he lived a lifestyle that kept him in trouble
Guess that's just the consequences of the life that we come from
Originally from Tennessee, country nigga, funny nigga
Ask him what he doing he go say: "I'm getting money nigga"
Always made me laugh, even when he made me mad
We used to write rhymes, I tried to lead him down a different path
Nobody wanted to get tough with him
And he'd see niggas if somebody fucked with me
Always in and out of lockdown
Couldn't get my nigga to calm down
Walking that tight rope, hoping that he don't fall down
The hood asked me when the last time I spoked to him
He sent me a letter saying I'm the only one that wrote to him
He used to say "I'll do better when I get out"
I remember, I got the call, I was sitting in Chris Webber's house
He find out his girl was pregnant, months later then he got shot

[Bridge: Biggie Smalls]
I ain't gon' front, [?]
Friends about to get locked up
It still ain't really, It ain't really hit me, you know what I'm saying?
I mean, when my best friend got killed it kind of shocked me up
But, it was like I didn't, I didn't know
I got introduced to drugs, you know what I'm saying, and the game and know I'm from that 9 to 3 period I can make by the end $2000

[Verse 3: Jon Connor]
I reminisce about my little cousin Jake
It ain't a day that I wake up that I don't wish I had him back
In high school, yeah I felt my shit was kind of wack
Was making even more, especially knew the words to all my raps
Back then I would call him when I write it
He would tell me if he like it
And we both getting excited, I'm getting better at rhyming
When we was little, he'd even try to rap with me
We in the mirror actin like Biggie and Master P
Shit, we was just fans
Cash Money, Rough Ryder, two we yellin' in the stance
Sean John Jeans-outfits, with bandanas 'round our head
Looking like the Hot Boyz, reciting every word they said
So I'm at Four Sales, I'm studying for a test
Stressed, you told me don't worry just do my best
The day I got off a break, was the day you got in a wreck
The day I was supposed to see you, the day I laid you to rest
Now tell me is it worth it, and is this really success, man?

[Bridge: Biggie Smalls]
All I can tell them is just keep trying, you know what I'm saying
Consistency is the best thing, you know what I'm saying?
As long as you keeping it real, and you keep trying

[Outro: Jon Connor]
Ay yo Jake
Remember when we used to rap Gangsta Gangsta by N.W.A?
I just worked with Dre and Cube, man
Life crazy like that sometimes, man
I miss you, I love ya'll
