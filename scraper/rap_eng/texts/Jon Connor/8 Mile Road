[Intro: Jon Connor & (DJ Don Cannon)]
Yeah
The People's Rapper (That's right) That's all I could ever be
(All Varsity Music) This is how the fuck I feel
Uh (Cannon, Conner)
They keep askin me, "Connor why you keep on putting out so much music?"
'Cause the more I shit on the game the more they try to refuse it
I drop whenever I want 'cause I got the talent to do it
I'ma prove it you fucking doofus, keep thinking I'ma lose it
They keep askin me, "Connor why you keep on putting out so much music?"
'Cause the more I shit on the game the more they try to refuse it
I drop whenever I want 'cause I got the talent to do it
I'ma prove it you fucking doofus, keep thinking I'ma lose it
They keep askin me, "Connor why you keep on putting out so much music?"
'Cause the more I shit on the game the more they try to refuse it
I drop whenever I want 'cause I got the talent to do it
I'ma prove it you fucking doofus, keep thinking I'ma lose it

[Verse 1: Jon Connor]
This the criteria when you feel like people ain't hearing ya
Mixtape every two months, "Goddamn is this nigga serious?" Yeah
'Cause now I feel like they backed me into a corner
They keep tryna fuck me, feel like they backed me into a porno
Peep it, you motherfuckers ain't blind, I know you see it
Why I go so hard, look what I gotta compete with
Whack niggas with deals with multi-millionaire dollar budgets
Niggas with co-signs that shine 'cause of who they fuck with
Sons and daughters of artist that make it 'cause of they fathers
And whether they're good or not they gon' see B.E.T regardless
But I never get discouraged, keep going, I go the hardest
Shit, I'm just a kid from Flint tryna make it, caught up in all this
Damn

[Chorus: Jon Connor]
This what it feel like when it's real life
When the only way to survive is to kill mics
(Is to kill mics) So I kill mics
(So I kill mics) Yeah yeah, yeah, yah, yo

[Verse 2: Jon Connor]
Why would I write this?
Knowing half these people in the game would not like this
But they really don't like me anyway so what I say
"It's looking like you niggas in the motherfucking crisis!"
'Cause I be spitting real and my voice is not high-pitched
And I don't wear jeans that are tighter than a vice grip
I like to wear jeans that I can pull-up over my dick
Reckless, I got drive like I drive without a license
Niggas on my dick and talking shit just like my side bitch
I don't want a lot, I just wanted a shot
I won't stop being hot, whether you like it or not
I'm too good to be true, too good to be you, I'm too good for my own good
And I will not end up back in the hood
I'm tryna add it up, maybe I wasn't wack enough
Or maybe my raps ain't bad enough, or maybe I ain't said swag enough
But at the end of this, I'm the motherfuckin heir to the throne
Ain't afraid to take a stand even if I'm standing alone, gone

[Chorus: Jon Connor]
This what it feel like when it's real life
When the only way to survive is to kill mics
(Is to kill mics) So I kill mics
(So I kill mics) Uh huh, look

[Verse 3: Jon Connor]
To anyone who inquire I am here to inspire
That's why when I cypher it's hot shit like I'm lighting a diaper
I keep proving I got bars like Iâ€™m writing in Rikers
Circle with life is what eight to nine priors behind them
Back in the day, you do an album in a year you were straight
Now you gotta drop a song every day to be great
Then niggas start falling off just tryna keep up the pace
And in a sense it devalues all the music we make
So I guess, this is the part of the record where I get reckless
'Cause I'ma tell you right now just how long you can expect this
Till the world know my name, and everybody respect it
Pull forth my strongest effort, I gotta make 'em accept it
And when they do, just know exactly where my mind is
Still making sure every rhyme is timeless
A mixtape is a vehicle for reaching my goal
But my album's is a piece of my soul, just get ready
