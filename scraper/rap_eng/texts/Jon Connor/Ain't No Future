[Intro: Jon Connor]
Some of y'all might not know
So Imma drop some history real quick
I'm from Flint, Michigan
I want to say rest in peace to our pioneer, MC Breed
Whom put us on the map back in 1990
So now in 2011, Imma do my part for Fly city
So allow me to pay homage and salute
Fly city we do it a little something like this

[Verse 1: Jon Connor]
This is for my residence, Fly city on so Imma represent
Flow is still the sickest, like he still ain't get his medicine
I'm from the city about that action
Niggas don't do threats, because if they say it it's gon' happen
Niggas spitting fire, Imma hold the torch high
Up and down landing, raised on the north side
They be looking at me now like "Connor yo we made it"
A nigga at the shop, at Pasa Nino getting faded
We don't give a fuck, because we were raised in the jungle
We gon' represent it, too much struggle to be humble
Out of town proud, got love for the D
But homie please don't get it twisted, yes I'm from the F-L-I-N-T
In the city, where grinding is what we are best at
Shouts to the fifth ward, holla at me west pad
I does it for the mitten it's plain to see
You're listening to the sounds of reef and the boy Jay-Z

[Hook]
It ain’t no future in your fronting
(I thought I told you niggas, man)

[Verse 2: Jon Connor]
I never got caught with a kilo
Or acted like I did because the faking  ain’t for me
I was raised around niggas that were really in the streets so
I can tell a fake motherfucker when I see one
You know where I’m from so you know what I saw
Hoes on my dick so we like "fuck the law"
Getting harassed by the cops is routine
Grabbing on my 501, Levi jeans
We are about our business but also know we got pride
Do it high way [?] caught my niggas on the the south side
Hooping in our free time, black little brown pride
Shouts to my hispanics representing on the east side
Flint we’re taking over, the war zones [?] breed soldiers
You make it out, you're lucky like a four-leaf clover
So get it clear and don't forget when I told you
I got the throne with my city on my shoulder

[Hook]
It ain't no future in your fronting
(y'all better cut all that clown shit out)

This is a tour through my city through these verses
Connor keep it jumping like it's sunday up in Bursten
I’ll be at the Loft, when I get off nigga just call me
Mo Cleef telling me to meet him at the Palm Tree
[?]
Niggas keep a bitch on, burning in their lap
Blue City Club is the clique and I be different
And it ain’t gon' change for the world or the government
I'm speaking for my city so I can never be quiet
Because niggas steady dying for the M-O-N-E-Y
We breed real niggas, so ain't shit that you could tell me
Holla at me Merle Hood, holla at me Cell B
I rep for the city, every verse, every feature
[?]
You got my back and I got yours
What time is it? huh, tear down the doors

[Hook]
It ain’t no future in your fronting
(Rest in peace, Breed)

[Outro: Jon Connor]
It ain’t no future in your fronting
It never was, cuhh
1990 to 2011, RIP Breed
Flint town equals Fly city
I represent for the whole Fly city (I'm feeling real Fli-nished right now)
North, southwest to central
Rest in peace, Central
Connor, Flint power is happening
In Dubb, what up?
Beefing, what up Uptown?
Cold Water road, I see you
Fuck it nigga, flexing [?], nigga
It ain't no future in your fronting (I got you)
