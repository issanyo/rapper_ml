Look..
I been through hell
Theres more to come
Thats how the cookie crumbles
Gimme my crumbs
These niggas ain't real
These hoes ain't nuns
So i don't trust no mofuking one
Ima kill this shit
Gimme my gun
Chase my dreams
Gimme my rum
For all the real shit that be coming off my tongue
Ain't no limit to the stress make a nigga say uhhh
Money in the bank
Friends don't exist
Hoping god dont forget to put me on the list
All the money in the world don't make a nigga rich
Cause even when you broke there is shit that money can't fix
And that make you wanna holla when a dolla
Ain't the solution to solving your problems
See im an addict and the world is what i see it for
Cause even when i don't need more
I keep saying i need more..
I just spit it got rejected
It will beat you if u let it
Niggas hating on my mothafucking method
Niggas wouldn't gimme credit
But they got respect it and accept it
Cause it seem like im the only nigga putting forth the effort
I got a double life, and I'm try and keep um separate
Mama took me to the reverend ask for him to give me blessings
Now im at the tele ready to check it
And ima fuck her if she naked
God damn tell me i don't need direction
