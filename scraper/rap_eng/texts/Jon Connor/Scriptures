[Verse 1]
I came in the game, like fuck these niggas, I ain't got no friends, I don't want none either
I'm riding by myself, and I ain't smoking on keisha
That boy hot than a motherfucker, spit fire, like I was smoking on ether
I've been spitting like this since I was a lil' nigga, fronting like I had hoes with a turnt off beeper
I see a whole lot of fake shit, some niggas sayin' that I'm too real
If you was better than niggas that never got your profit, never stop, how the fuck would you feel
This for my niggas in the basement, all my niggas in the garage
Thinking that this rap see this fake or a mirage
Oh I'mma act a ass, for my niggas shit, I'mma ask Nicki for a minaj
See I don't just beat the odds, I eat the odds
Then shit on niggas, how you gon' sleep on me, tryin' to beat the mob
I make a silent sub
Out that pillow nigga hold up
I told you niggas it's my motherfucking time bro
I told you niggas about fucking around with Jon ho
Y'all sweet, this a piece of cake, I'mma eat you better believe that
Real shit that's what I spit, to the people cause I see they need that
Wack shit, get ate alive, my ego, y'all gon feed that
Flintstone with an old soul this the closest thing to get MC Breed back
Gone

[Hook]
I'm the realest and that's all that I'mma ever be
But y'all don't hear me though
Everyone got me praying for my enemies
But y'all don't hear me though
Pray for my enemies, nigga pray for my enemies
But y'all don't hear me though
Pray for my enemies, nigga pray for my enemies
But y'all don't hear me though

[Verse 2]
Nigga don't trip, that mean be cautious, the flow is sick cause I get nauseous
When I hear all this garbage, I'm scaring niggas in the office
People counting down cause my shit coming, hold me down cause my shit bumping
Industry can't shut me up cause my mouth ain't for no dick sucking
People love this shit I make, phony bitches that shit I hate
Phony bitches all in my face, better try they best to stay in my grace
Murder, murder trail of dead, bodies at my feet, kill it, weak shit
Got me catching bodies as we speak
Give me straight fuck nigga, I've been doing fine without y'all
Feeling like an outlaw, like I'm living by Pacs laws
Y'all will never catch me, giving a fuck about y'all
Haters I say fuck 'em, and anybody around y'all
This one more time, nigga testify
Nigga I'm the truth, all these hits don't lie
Say I ain't dope, nigga you so high
And they say I drop bombs, so the truth's gon' fly

[Hook]
