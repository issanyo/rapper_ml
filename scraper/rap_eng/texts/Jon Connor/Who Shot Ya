[Verse 1]
Just give me two minutes of lyrics and you'll feel it
Headstrong it's like hearing me chew spinach
The number one spot say hi to the new tenant
If you sick my nigga this is the flu clinic
Ready for war move or we shooting the lieutenant
Been paying dues long overdue so let's do business
About to capitalize like I'm starting a new sentence
Niggas ain't good, not until we say good riddance
Up against me you're sacrificing your rapper life
Kill you niggas see you in hell then take your afterlife then bring you back to life
That was just a warning for you dudes
That I got more control over your fucking life than you do
Who got the juice feeling like Pac running from [?] until he popped his ass the whole industry left in body bags
I body trash niggas because [?] when I'm at the podium this ain't fair that's like Nick Fury verse Nickelodeon
Getting money then show me then Pac is on Ethiopian, niggas ain't really winning I'm finna to show you the trophy then
First place I'll beat y'all running my worst race
Worst case I'll shit on you niggas piss on your birthplace
Run, hide nigga because I'll never get tongue-tied
You crab ass niggas like you was fresh on the drum line
You want bars well you got snatched up by one time it's like gun fine at your front line
Until you done trying, fuck I hate that pun die
Dead in the middle, of little Italy, little did we know that we riddle
To middle me, who did diddly this is the epitome literally the remedy of niggas who say they sick of me
Industry, enemy [?] we be picking your gravesite
Rapping in front of killers and sinners will kill my stage fright
Niggas playing with me y'all know I'm not with the games right
Dude your losing your hair like the end of a Johnny [?] fight
Play nice or I take lives and exit stage right
Vampire nigga, I'll never see daylight
Watching the the game suffer Like Django watching the slaves fight
Niggas thinking they winning well we ain't watching the same fight
You about to learn a lesson, you about to catch it for black depression, the Great Depression
My depression the fact my pops left me
Fuck niggas I went to school with, you about to get bruises for shit you had nothing to do with
I'll showoff so don't confuse it I won't shoot it I alley-oop it
To myself, the shit that I'm doing is fucking inhuman
Anticpate the nigga that's great, give you more lines than a interstate, still an 8
Niggas scrapping they dinner plate, in my face you niggas egging me on
I'm the best in the world, shit tell me I'm wrong
Just give me 2 minutes of lyrics then you finished
2 minutes is up I'm finished fucking with you niggas
