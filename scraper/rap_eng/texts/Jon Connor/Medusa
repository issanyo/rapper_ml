[Verse 1]
Bad bitches with bad intentions that cater to our conditions
Niggas stab you with knives, but a kiss is even more vicious
I've seen it
Say they love you, look you in your eye and don't mean it
Girl of your dreams leave you while you sleeping, look
Malicious hugs and kisses, contradictions
Breakfast she fixes, does the dishes, we stay optimistic
Give up the pussy, take her shopping
Seduction become sadistic materialistic wishes
Fuck anybody that get it and she will get it
Cause y'all committed through lust and fiction
Valentine's day starting to feel like tricking
You wanna spoil her, but she too persistent
Too specific, instead of thinking about you
She thinking about something new for Christmas
Moments in time we men choose to be blind
See the truth in her eyes, but we take abuse cause she fine
Now we losing our minds, say we confused by the signs
The truth is we see the truth, but we'd rather fuel with the lies
Eyes so pretty, attitude so shitty
100's, 20's, 50's, feeling like your last name is ''Gimme''
I can't explain why we never wanna lose her
Staring in the eyes of Medusa

[Hook]
Bitches come, bitches go
But we never learn
Never, never, never, never, never, never learn
Bitches come, bitches go
But we never learn
Never, never, never, never, never, never learn
Don't look into her eyes, never let her see
Don't look into her eyes, never let her see
Don't look into her eyes, never let her see
That's true, that's true

[Verse 2]
This ain't nothing new, I done seen this road before
Give your all then you fall in love and find out she's a ho
See, you knew about her reputation, you said that's just speculation
But it's time that you make up your mind
She gave you head to change it
Sweet words to keep you where she wants you
''Don't you love me? Get this for me, Go on, baby, get this money
Now something moving in the tummy''
Oh, the trap, it's too late to react
Two-faced, but now you and face number 2 have to interact
Confused when you lose, you used to doing anything to win her back
Whatever you do se was into that
As long as y'all was in the sack it was all good
And now y'all got two kids
You loved her for who you wish she was and not for who she is
But see she still the same
Circumstances are the only thing that change
And for ignoring intuition you only have yourself to blame
Thinking all your good deeds gon' make her want you
A ho can't turn into a housewife, but that's only if she want to
Medusa
