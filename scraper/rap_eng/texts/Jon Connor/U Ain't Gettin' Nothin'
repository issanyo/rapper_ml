[Hook: Jon Connor]
I hear you talkin' but your words is not showin' up
See why you stuntin' and frontin', homie we blowin' up
Nigga we hit it, your misses she wanna roll with us
Let's make a toast to the haters, my nigga pour it up
"Nothin, nothin', you ain't scaring nothin'" - Lil Wayne 'A Milli'

[Verse Two: XV]
My, my, my why don't I just take a gander
At these bloggers and these ranchers and they motherfuckin' slander
Go for broke with every flow
I got speakers goin' Hammer
And you dudes a little too Zoolander
Squarian nation
Ball/bald on you niggas like the Aryan nation
Supreme with that white
Had a motherfuckers life lookin' darker than a Haitian
Look around the hood, take a peek at what we facin'
So I dare a nigga to tell me I can't rhyme
Give me a pale track, I'll give it tan lines
Tryin' to teach Heaven with these bars
Stayin' away from Hell in a cell like a retired man ?
Blew up from the ground up like a landmine
While you niggas ain't sellin'/cellin' like a fuckin' land line
And L7's is the hand sign
But me and 7 ain't take an L in a long ass time nigga

[Hook]
