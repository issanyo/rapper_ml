[Hook]

I wake up feelin' like I need it
I ain't never had shit so I can't miss shit
Now we up in this bitch like

Y'all make me do it when I need it
I ain't never had shit so I can't miss shit

I wake up feelin' like I need it
Yeahhh, uhhh

[Verse 1: Jon Connor]

Everybody say hello
To the new kid on the block all night
Jordan Knight ormello
Y'all niggas soft, y'all sweet marshmallow
Your heart pump kool-aid, your hear made of jello
Never been fake, fake niggas hate
That so when they talk to me I can't relate back
Fuck y'all niggas sayin' that he can't rap
I shine through when every nigga in my state rap
Profane, propane, any nigga bring up, my name
This shit, the lockout, cause I ain't playin' no games
Folks sayin' that they like me, how?
You ain't like me then, why you like me now?
Got a chick that I wanted to hit in high school
On the other line wanting to fuck me right now
Funny how niggas change when you get change
Funny how niggas change when you get fame
Fame don't mean you got money
And the fame came first
Niggas hated before the change even came
Got back up any time I stumbled
Wised up every time I got humble
That's why I'm a mother fucking beast
That's how it is when you raised in the jungle
In the hood money is the savior
Shit's the answer to all our prayers
But I'm gonna spend this shit how I want to
Cause at the end of the day it's just paper

[Hook]

I wake up feelin' like I need it (hold on while you still can)
Y'all make me do it when I need it (hold on while you still can)

Now we up in this bitch like
I need that, I need that, I need that, I need that
I ain't never had shit so I can't miss shit

Now we up in this bitch like
I need that, I need that, I need that, I need that
I ain't never had shit so I can't miss shit
Real Shit

[Verse 2: Jon Connor]

We wipe our ass with paper, we write on paper
So how people lose they life for paper?
Broke niggas lose they wives for paper
Get locked up, niggas do life for paper
Why do we chase this, paper with big faces
Of men who was fuckin' racist?
And if it was up to them my black ass
Would still be in the back of a slave ship
Fuck that, I'mma spend soon as I get it
Hammer time nigga
I can bet a rich nigga died yesterday
And I can guarantee the money ain't go with him
So I'mma just ball the fuck out while I'm livin'
And when I'm gone they gonna say he did it
Came from nothin' to standin' on top of the world
And ain't nobody helped me with it
Talk to me

[Hook]

I wake up feelin' like I need it (hold on while you still can)
Y'all make me do it when I need it (hold on while you still can)

Now we up in this bitch like
I need that, I need that, I need that, I need that
I ain't never had shit so I can't miss shit

Now we up in this bitch like
I need that, I need that, I need that, I need that
I ain't never had shit so I can't miss shit
You feel me?
