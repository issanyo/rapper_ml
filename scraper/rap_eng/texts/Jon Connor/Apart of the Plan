[Intro: Dizzy Wright]
Aw damn. This must be all a part of the motherfuckin' plan

[Verse 1: Dizzy Wright]
Yo, this must be a part of the plan (right)
Took away their water and put all these guns in their hands
The niggas that go to jail get out and don't never have a chance (whoa)
Maybe they can create a system that they can go to and expand (you know)
Something like college for criminals to become a better man (right)
Fully service learning with a high security demand (that's right)
Something to change the trends, you know, getting the niggas off the stands
No more courtrooms if they didn't feel like they was pushed to the same sins
I'm talking gyms to get criminals off the street (real)
Put 'em in jail and hold 'em back
We making the criminals increase ('crease)
Dealing with a system that can't be beat, rest in peace
Funny how they knocking us down but want us to stand on our feet (Fuck you mean)
Who's held responsible for a government breach
The governor or the nigga that paid the state emergency fee (yo, point 'em out)
Everything is starting to make a lot of sense
They tearing houses down, they pushing the poverty up out of Flint
"Let's turn it to a college town, move in all college kids"
All I know is jobs over jails and they ain't got the shit
Living a nightmare cause y'all forgot the shit
Creating a warzone and expecting them to be positive
This shit is wild (shit is wild)
And now I'm bringing the fire spelled backwards
And power residence of Flint, Miss LaDonna, I'ma holla at you 'cause
I got ideas for kids, and not only do I provide my own, energy is limitless
The real battles start back at home
These youngins here will crack your dome
But do it like Marissa Schills
Driving down Saginaw I just passed Berston Fields
I'm just feeling hurt they don't respect me for every verse I kill
Vegas raised but Flint, Michigan hanging up my jersey still
Worth a mill, feed your mind
Read up in between the lines
Food for thought
If you're feeling lost, then you will see in time

[Verse 2: Jon Connor]
Today's agenda, those who are supposed to defend us are just pretenders
They pretend to avenge us
But me and Dizzy connect like The Avengers
These adventures make us venture to the days that they used to lynch us
No rope, but hope for a better day is what they're still using against us
Our life is garbage, we the adult babies of Brenda
Look, we don't succeed 'cause we was never meant to
So much aggression pent up
Let's continue to enter the mind of the mentally injured
Mentality embedded in us
Sent up is where we end up, because of a system that's injust
Shouts to my nigga, Sam, who doin' 10 plus
It's obvious we the ones that Kunta Kinta
True to my roots, true to the truth
It's true that that flag represents me too
But it does not excuse the abuse
And to the fools who rebuke it
Try to counter-accuse in the news
There is no excluding the truth
Only skewed views that's misleading you
That's glued to the tube, confused
Digging up old wounds of racial fuels
Sweeping new problems under the rug with a old broom
Stay tuned
My city caught a bad break and it never stopped
Like bad breaks got a bad case of the bad days at a fast pace
Got little niggas moving too fast in these streets, like a drag race
Kids losing their class mates, texting each other the emoji sad face
We grew up fast
Yeah, we would cut class to go cut sluts with a plump ass
Now we got a son with the first one that let us fuck fast
Much too young, we have become dads
Much too young, we have become that in which we hate
Nothing to anticipate
The same shit, just a different date
Primate, health feel like a handout
So we like, bitch, we straight
Pray for the children in my city that got diseases
'Cause they poisoned the water and leave us with nobody to help, but Jesus
So from Dayton Ave to Beecher
To the east side to the Regency's, I see you
This one here for my people
Come on
