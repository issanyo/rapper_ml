[Chorus (Craig Stevens, Jenna Noelle) (KG?)]
This could be it this time
Lets say goodbye
I know why I've tried
I'm fading this time
If only for the rest of the evening
We give each other something to believe in
I think I'll be fine...

[Jon Connor]
Ok. ok..
Look
I dunno why I act like that
I dunno why I ain't call back
I dunno know why I said that shit
Man, I dunno why I be so whack
I can't tell you why
You love me like you doooooo
Prolly shouldn't said I love you tooo
Why I ain't come home that night
Why I did I cut on the lights
Why my footsteps wake you up
That chick I was with wasn't even that tight
Why I ain't jus say you right
Why I still put up a fight
Knowing damn well I was wrong, but i'm caught up in the hype
Can we work it out, we can...
But over one weekend
We contemplating the thought, can you and me be friends?
Why it always end like this
With love its hit or miss
But I guess I bid you farewell
But girl you will be missed
Cause i know..

This could be it this time
Lets say goodbye
I knowwww......(why) i've tried
I'm fading this time
If only for the rest of the evening
We give each other something to believe in
I think i'll be fine......

[Hook}
Txt message last night that i didn't return. return.. return
Phone calls last night and i wasn't concerned. concerned..concerned
Txt message last night that i didn't return. return.. return
Phone call last night and i wasn't concerned. concerned.. concerned

[Enter Jenna]
This could be it this time
Lets say goodbye
I know i tried
I'm fading this time
If only for the rest of the evening
We give each other something to believe in
I think i'll be fine....
