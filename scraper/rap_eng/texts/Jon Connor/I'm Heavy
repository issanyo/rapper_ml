Uh, I mean you ain't even gotta ask about me nigga
You just walk up to a mothafucka and they just tell you bout me nigga
Whole name ain't gotta come out your mouth, niggas already know
They have 50 cents for you

[Verse 1: Jon Connor]
Uh, look, boss shit, the code that I live by
Finally made it, every nigga in the crib by
Bad bitches, every chick up in the crib bi
You fuckin clown, I'mma show you how to live life
Uh, all this hard work done paid off
This how you live when you don't take no fuckin days off
Eyes red, studio I'm workin long shifts
You beefin over hoes, you fuckin with the wrong bitch
Yeah, real nigga chronicles
I tell the vamanos, now they fallin' like dominoes
I'm everywhere, lookin for me like tryin to find a ghost
She give me brain like this ho is on the honor roll
Real shit, my life been on some ill shit
Since Mo Cleaves told me nigga go and kill shit
So give me life for this shit I write, lock me up
Sit back and watch me, Maserati pick the bodies up

[HOOK]

Went to the club and popped that Dom P, I'm a king, like ????

Pulled up in that Chevy, movin D, rest in peace to Heavy

[Verse 3: Jon Connor]
See now, these niggas is hatin and all these hoes they be watchin
I hit my folks out in Cali they told me lets get it poppin
Lame niggas be blockin because they bitches be jockin
Killin rappers is easy cuz most these niggas is garbage
I call em son of a bitches, but I blame that on they fathers
Now every city them hoes makin it clap, they applaud us
I hope my momma forgive me, I'm hittin somebody daughter
They be looking for ballers in VIP with the starters
Shit, I'm heavy out here, they don't know what to call it
Time is money my nigga, why the fuck is you stallin?
Traded paper for plastic, shit won't fit in my wallet
Two bad bitches, ass sick, call that shit a men-nauseus
Wanna roll with the bosses, see the club where I work
So spread your legs in the office, so why the fuck is we talkin?
Me and my nigga Mistah F.A.B. grindin hard to get it
Now we livin every minute and don't know nothin different, BITCH
