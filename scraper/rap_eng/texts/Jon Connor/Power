[Verse 1: Jon Connor]
When quitting ain't an option and losing ain't a thought
When you ain't conscious of your passion cause you don't ever turn it off
When your mom's still in the hood and everyday that's what reminds you
It ain't just about you, you got a whole city behind you
Look at the spot they got me in
You ain't like where I'm going, come stop me then
If it wasn't my destiny
I’m from Flint, then a nigga would have been had shot me then
And Flint is not a possibility
Said one in a million is probably the probability
Look where I’m from, you niggas ain’t feeling me
Every one friend we got we probably got ten enemies
I was raised on Pulp Fiction
Where your bitch friend could end up snake shit
Little niggas hug the block before school
Yeah, we call that working that day shift
Got four cousins all in probation
My family ain’t take no vacations
Shit, we lucky to see Detroit
We go to Cedar Point we think that we made it
Michigan, motherfucker, Michigan, motherfucker
About time that they finally let us in, motherfucker
Big Sean, Royce da 5, Eminem, motherfucker
J-Dilla, MC Breed, back again
It got me getting high lately, wondering when the Lord gon' take me
God said he gon' fix my problems so nothing in this world gon' break me
Shit, all I spread is love, but I still got niggas that hate me
Niggas screaming fuck me
While I’m still trying to fuck with Chelsea Lately
Look nigga, it’s Trick Trick, Doughboyz Cashout, D12
While you other motherfuckers assed out
Do it for my niggas and the hoes with their ass out
Fuck these haters and I will fuck a bitch ‘til she pass out
Past the point of no return
My state got shitted on, y'all moved on with no concern
Turned into rage, they made me wait my turn
Fire in my eyes, the world about to burn
I ain’t never had shit, my nigga
What make you think I’m about to give this up?
I know you know I hear the hate, my nigga
What make you niggas think I give a fuck?
Shouts to Calicoe and Slum Village was on the same date
[?]
I don’t know about you, but fuck number 2, I wanna be number 1, nigga
Y'all ain’t never seen nothing like me
Til the day I fuck around and have a son, nigga
Never waste no time with these bum niggas
Giving my all ‘til I’m done, nigga
Here to make history, the flow of the century
That was one hell of a run, nigga

Time to go, I got ya'll fuck that
Seven more, I got ya'll fuck that
I was taught to just go hard nigga this 'Bron, Kobe and hot sauce
Haters can suck my dick and get lockjaw
From Flint the shit will just pop off
Now I'm in the parking lot getting popped offed
By a bad bitch with the top off

[Refrain: Jon Connor]
Now this'll be a beautiful death
(I'm jumping out the window)

[Outro]
Salute out to Kanye West, the whole chi town, the whole mid-west
Shouts to my home Michigan
Ayo, if there was anybody I forgot to shout out in that verse
Blame my mind and not my heart
Y'all know I does it for y'all, it's The People's Rapper
We back again right?
A'int nothin' gonna stop us
Best in the World! Prove me wrong nigga!

(Flint we here nigga...Yeah, flint we here nigga...)
