[Verse 1: Bobby Capri]

American dream
American greed
Forever indebted
And now you can't breath
Land of the free
Ain't nothing here free
I'm just bitching again
Poor American me
Home of the teenage mood swing
Trench coat, high school shooting
Baseball caps and blue jeans
I'm just your round the way Bruce Springsteen
You can be born elsewhere
You can be just like everyone else here
Who the hell cares
Cause for real when you start out poor
Somehow, it never felt fair
Food stamps; no health care
Got new pants, but no belt tho
So I show my ass like they fell off
Just living on a prayer like Bob Jovi

[Hook: Bobby Capri]

It's the American Dream
The American Dream
Where the Red, White, and Blue might as well be Green
And we do anything
For everything

It's the American Dream
The American Dream
Where the Red, White, and Blue might as well be Green
And we do anything
For everything

[Verse 2: Bobby Capri]

Fast money ain't fast enough
Could have it all and wouldn't have enough
Been told that the early bird get the worm
And I still don't wanna eat my ass up
I wanna lay here all day
Just call in, like always
Front like my bills all are paid
I'll get a title loan; get the car appraised
Whether pawn shop or Ponzi scheme
HSN, we seen it on screen
It's all tied in as a part of this dream
Cash Rule Everything Around Me (C.R.E.A.M!)
Dollar dollar bill y'all
Get sick, and the doctor gon bill y'all
Can't heal y'all
But he can and will build a million dollar house off what those pills cost

[Hook: Bobby Capri]

It's the American Dream
The American Dream
Where the Red, White, and Blue might as well be Green
And we do anything
For everything

It's the American Dream
The American Dream
Where the Red, White, and Blue might as well be Green
And we do anything
For everything

[Verse 3: Jon Connor]

(Yea, yea, yea, look...)
A young n***a since birth
I been putting in work
Highly debated, he the greatest til he put in the dirt
This verse belong in a hearse
Murder in the first
Every time they put em to work
Connor gon take em to church
If it ever was a doubt
If a n***a wanna figure me out
Tell em I ain't one of these n****s you be hearing about
No it ain't no question
Or guessing or a mystery bout
His history
Enemies begin to be sick of me now
Every track I be lighting it up
My shit is dope like when my n****s re-up
Hold my city down, like I don't wanna see up
Illiterate motherfucker judging a book by its cover
When it come to Connor then you better read up
I'm old school like I'm tryna get a hall pass
I run shit like somebody said "haul ass!"
From Fly City where n****s say "it's all bad"
I'm the American Dream, n***a what you call that?

[Hook: Bobby Capri]

It's the American Dream
The American Dream
Where the Red, White, and Blue might as well be Green
And we do anything
For everything

It's the American Dream
The American Dream
Where the Red, White, and Blue might as well be Green
And we do anything
For everything
