Don't crucify me for my point of view
Too many fucking rappers out people might get confused
I pass out a cd
You pass one out make it hard to choose
They make it hard for a true artist to get his dues
Here go my life:
My girl mamma posed this question to me
Say what I do
I said I rap now we both feeling funny
Because her nephew rap too and he ain't getting money
He bullshitting so that the shit she expecting from me
Look, ain't enough time to explain the difference
But if there was I doubt she would even wonna listen
For every dope mc there's 20 whack
Yeah, the world is filled with dope rappers they're just buried under all the bullshit
See lil man won't get his chance cause he sat up with your mans
And y'all came up with a dance and y;all spent a couple grand
While, he just wonna make it, making music in his basement
Lyrics hot, beats blazing
Cause you nobody take it
Please, nigga have a conscience
If it ain't popped off by 40 get a job, shit
Its all the same
Look no matter if I switch states everybody spits great
Ya nigga got an album wait till I hit a mixtape

Yo, too many niggas with these gimmicks
When they finally pay attention to
The bullshit that you spitting
Just as bad as the mixing
One spit is real life, the other spiting that pretend shit
The consumer never heard eather so how know the difference
See, niggas spitting trash everyday polluting speakers
So nation wide buzz is what make people believers
And is that good or bad we just dont listen to neither
So my message is keep my head up to all my dreamers
See we all got a calling and a purpose believe me
A lot of niggas rapping because they think this shit is easy
And if thats the process thats going through your mind
Im trying to stop you from wasting your money and your time
See, niggas that be in it for the minute
Making it where you hit it
Turn local rapper to mainstream
Shit you almost get offended
Fuck, all my real niggas spending hours and them dollars in the studio
Keep going, gotta get it if you gotta do it
Cause your heart in it not cos you looking for profit
If that your motivation you should go get back in college
I know niggas with degrees
That ain't where they want to be
And seeing niggas wasting their time is the shit that bother me
