[Intro: DJ Drama]
So this the last call
The Late Registration Of A College Dropout Who Had A Dark Twisted Fantasy Of 808s And Heartbreak
This is [?] DJ Drama
Young Sav, Mocleaves, all varsity music
This is your last chance to get on board, before it's too late
This has been a Jon Connor production, Aftermath
Yours truly DJ Drama, party street music on the way
Best in the world, The Late Registration Of A College Dropout Who Had A Dark Twisted Fantasy Of 808s And Heartbreak
Get it? Don't get it twisted, this right here is the real thing, Jon Connor
Best in the world, I don't wanna have to tell you I told you so, but I told you so
Gone
