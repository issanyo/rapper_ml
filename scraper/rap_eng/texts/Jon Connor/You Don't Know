Yo, my thought process probably too much to process
Toxic when I spit that hot shit
They gossip when they hear me drop shit
Problem is, God sent Jon to bring the conscience to all this nonsense
Street smart and my knowledge is a masters degree in college
Huh- I seen him drop out, every punchline is a knockout
My bars will raise the dead, my next show I'm a bring Biggie and Pac out
The flow will choke rappers up, like when Mankind bring that sock out
And I don't give a f*ck, run in a cop's house, with my cock out
Around here we let them hoes fight, and be hoping a titty pop out
I'm a savage, my throne is in the kingdom of the madness
The people are drawn to me, can you imagine a magnate
The size of a skyscraper, I be killing every verse
Drive them off in hearse, put them in the dirt
Now they closer to Mama Nature
I bet your mama hates you, son of a bitch
Spitting dopeness numbing my lips, while the people loving my shit
Sav told me "put out a hit", it's like he put out a hit
Dumping clips, I'm killing MCs, ever since I ain't never miss
Look, more
, I think I've got them convinced
I spit a rap out, then they tap out, watch me make them sumbit
My bars are hard as f*ck, it's like they're made of cement
Niggas fall off because cars and broads is enough to make them content
Well not me, I need a monopoly on the game, that'll have me shopping
In Paris, where the paparazzi watch me, WATCH ME!
Like to look out, before you rappers get took out
They can't read me, they're waiting for me to put a book out
I eat beats, I'm inviting you to the cookout
I'm from where if a nigga grill you, he'll kill you
On the road to success, and the bullshit's in my rearview
The flow is God-gifted, you're listening listening to a miracle
The reason I dominate is because I don't find time to hate
To the niggas that do, they need to hide their face and hibernate
This a warning to anybody who's still snoring
I'm your worst nightmare that'll still be there in the morning
Connor!
