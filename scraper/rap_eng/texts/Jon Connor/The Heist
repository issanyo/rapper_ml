Yo Elite, come ride with me real quick
Yeah

I do it for the thrill of the sport
And if I get caught, nigga, fuck it
I'mma show my dick to the court
(How big is the score?)
It's millions or more, the life, the allure
Getting out of the hood
For good and not being poor
Take what I want, then I take 'em to war
Been pounding the motherfucking pavement for so long
My knuckles is sore
And I see they got a lock on the door
We comin' in through the ceiling and floor
They asking what I'm doing this for
Ain't nobody give it to me
The hood already like prison to me
Popeye had to swallow his pride
It's tastin' like spinach to me
So I'mma take it, put the mask on my face
Now they hatin' the way they made me
For all the days I was waitin'
My flow is like a shawty
Cause I don't have a problem bodyin' everybody
(I told you don't move)
Nigga don't try me
Look, don't be a hero, it's better to be an ally
Or say your prayers or
You're gonna need a priest, pastor or rabbi
I hate it had to come to this
But understand that my whole life I wanted this
Verses killin', got me on the Most Wanted list
But I grew up around niggas who wasn't wantin' shit
So I put my whole fucking life into rappin'
So I guess you could call this a crime of passion
They gonna put me in this chamber that the put the gas in
Cause I'mma keep murderin' verses 'till they close the casket
Yeah, a lot of niggas eatin', I ain't one of 'em
So when I do this I don't feel remorse for none of them
The flow got 'em sweating bullets
It's like I got a gun on 'em
And each bar is a charge, I got a ton of 'em
Fuck y'all, I'm lovin' it
Anti-establishment rappers just started vanishin'
Yeah, I turn 'em to stiffs
Motherfuckers lookin' like mannequins
Niggas hate when I write
It's like takin' a life
Life is a bitch and I made her my wife
Now you payin' the price
Listen up, better me takin' your spot
Than you takin' a shot
And nigga I'm from Flint
So that's sayin' a lot
See I'm takin' your shine, now all of it's mine
Diamond in the rough and it's a mine in every line
It's that simple
Criminal minded, killin' niggas with that mental
Help us all, start by jumpin' the fuck out of that window
Go kill yourself, save me the trouble
When I spit I wet the beat up, leavin' a puddle
Hold up, niggas ain't safe
Now I'm takin' the safe
Look, metaphorically speakin', I'm takin' they place
On the run for this shit
I hope they down for the chase
Cause I really don't give a fuck who they got on the case
Cause dog, I've been on this grind for most of my life
And I admit a habit, I been rollin' the dice
But every move is calculated, decisions precise
They let me in the industry, now it's time for The Heist
Let's go
