Maserati
Turn me up
It's Connor, the best in the world
You know what I'm saying Imma share this with y'all
I can't see them coming down my eyes, so I got to make this song cry (y'all know how the song goes, let me tell my story)

[Verse 1: Jon Connor]
Shy girl, could barely look me in my eyes girl
But I didn't give a fuck because no matter what you was my girl
Pushing the trailblazer like it was a Maybach
We made paradise, it didn't matter where we stayed at
Deep in the hood, far from candy canes and gun-drops
We learnt to block out the gun shots, when the sun dropped
You had a daughter but didn't fuck with her father
So I made sure I taught her, every time that I saw her
The best I could but shit I was still young
The three of us taking pictures and all of us stick out our tongues
I wasn't big of kids because if your girl had one
You got to detach yourself from her and the kid when you're done
We wasn't thinking about that, we wanted to have a son
No time soon but we used to dream about the things to come
We used to have arguments, I would tell you this shit was dumb
Because you was my one but my career was what made you run

[Hook x2]
I can't see them coming down my eyes, so I got to make this song cry
I can't see them coming down my eyes, so I got to make this song cry

[Verse 2: Jon Connor]
Back when MySpace was fucking up relationships at a high rate
She was cyberstalking doing all the shit that I hate
Seeing hoes on my wall, asking me have we talked
Questions about my exes, how long have we been involved?
Told her that she was bitching but it was women's intuition
I might have sent a couple messages that probably pushed the limits
Flirting with chicks often, I couldn't tell you why I did it
I've said a lot of shit to a lot of chicks but I've never meant it
Like how you tell your girl I said that shit just to hit it?
She catch you in your lies even when you won't admit it
And now she's paranoid, every second, every minute
Now she's reliving her past, this time was supposed to be different
And now she don't trust you
Now she barely touch you
In her mind she's thinking about all the bitches that've fucked you
Now she be thinking about all the people that she've been dumped to
Laying with another nigga, knowing she still loves you

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Jon Connor]
Two broken hearts, we tried to fix them
But we became too distant
Tried to pick up where we left off but it's too different
Arguments and soots to the point it's getting ridiculous
Phone ring or we get a text, we getting suspicious
Now we can't leave the house, say it's a lie before it leaves my mouth
Put up with each other, still hoping it evens out
Hoping it works but the truth is, we're in doubt
Can't remember who cheated last, we're just hoping we even out
Can't turn back the hands of time but I wish
Because those became the times of mine that I miss
All the times I never appreciated a kiss
Would be the time that I would only feed for your lips
Yes we don't appreciate when the houses are home
It's true you don't know what you've got, until it's gone
To this day I still think about you constantly
I want to see you happy, even if it's not with me
Word to Maze man

[Hook]

[Outro]
Yeah
