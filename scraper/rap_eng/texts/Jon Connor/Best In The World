[Verse 1]
This is big dog to a poodle, dead man to a shooter
Nigga, you full of shit, you’re a bedpan in a sewer
Head strong, I manuever like Lex Luger, I’m brutal
I’m from the hood where we make a feast outta ramen noodles
Look, I’m from the bottom where baby mamas the problem
She beefing with baby daddy, she calling a nigga to rob him
Play like she don’t know who shot him, inside she happy they got him
It’s like tomato tomato, wonder if you gon' see tomorrow
This is the motto that most of my people follow
Cause I know a couple cats that ain’t hollows sitting at McDonald's
Look, or have it your way, gourmet, bring it right to you
Sharp minded to the blinded, this the knife to you
Fake niggas is transparent, see right through you
And it’s apparent I’m your parent, I give life to you
Sonning you niggas, some of you dumb niggas
Niggas my age that should be schooling these young niggas
You bum niggas, swallow your tongue, niggas
It ain’t guns, it’s stupid niggas with guns that’s gon' kill us
My shits official, you niggas is wooden nickle
You stick out, we wouldn’t miss ‘em, that mean my shooters won’t miss 'em
You in the wrong hood so ain’t nobody gonna’ miss him
And if I gotta' blame him I gotta blame whoever was with him
You shouldn’t been trying to get him, but instead you was saying ‘'get him’‘
Now one of you niggas gone and the other one facing prison, Lord
And mama like ’‘why my baby had to be involved?’‘
Life is a gamble and the nigga tried to pull his card
Not knowing the other side was strapped like the national guard
Death in his eyes like you can see his reaction to God
Niggas get murdered everyday and we just trying to ball
But this ain’t like the NBA where you taking a charge

[Hook]
I am the untouchable, I am the unbreakable
I am the best in the mother — in the motherfucking world
Best in the motherfucking world
I’m the best in the motherfucking world

[Verse 2]
Nigga, I am the best probably because I never rest
Never thought for a second that I would be second best
I’m the best in the game, go ahead and cut down the net
I got the cheat code like the ref is placing the bet
If you put it on me, tell them niggas time to collect
You bird ass niggas, now I’m bombing your nest
Feel like Tyson bombing your chest, meanwhile I ain’t feeling the pick
When you collide with my my drive feel like you escaped from a wreck
And this is food for thought, don’t know you ate from the rest
But this the state from the chef, make you scrape up the place and invest
From the school of hard knocks niggas bringing right to your desk
I am the study guide so you know your right from left
And what you missed now better get it right on the test
Make sure you’re sure of yourself before you write on the test
I’m from where a second guess with a second left is death
And you could be the exception, but I ain’t holding my breath
Fuck it
