[Jon Connor]
I lived through the era of the white-T
Now it's the tight jeans
Guess don't nobody like me cuz ain't nobody like me
They said they wanted change, so they started dressin' weird
But now they all look like a bunch of weird niggas that look the same
Look, niggas is lost, right? Or maybe we lost sight
Blindin' is the sign of the times, what's on your mind?
They don't want me to be profound, this shit's bigger than Nino Brown
Welcome to hell bitch, let me show you around
Trends get sold, get old, then turn into mo'
Well I'm breakin' them overseas that I plant grow from the soul
I'm fightin' a lot of shit: the hood, industry, politics
Tryna convince people that don't know what good and garbage is
It ain't a argument, fuck how hard it is
I still rep for the ones who started it
Homie I put my all in this
This is history here, come be a part of it
The level I'm on, ain't nobody on par with it
They keep tellin' me "this is a evolution"
But evolution's when shit gets better and I get stupid
One time for the people, let's get stupid
I would die for you like prince with this revolution
"Oh, he a mixtape rapper"
No, I just dropped a project and for fun I dropped a mixtape after
Get it clear, the gimmicks is endin' here
Careers is in the air, I'm the reason they been in fear
I am out of my brain, so don't shoot shots
The aim is outta your range, plus niggas ain't been trained
Cuz this verse is a bus hittin' a train
Pain you can't explain, I suggest you stay in your lane
You wanted dope, well this a crane full of cocaine
And this is the resort when the game is ready for change
So off we go, let the trumpets blow
Cuz you know, you now rockin' with the best in the globe
The ruler's back
