[Verse 1: Jon Connor]
Thoughts racing through my mind like it's a finish line
Life is a bitch, the real privilege is dying
Fuck if you don't like me, give a fuck if you respect me
I walk around with the weight of the world on my shoulders
Like this shit ain't heavy, look
Real niggas gon' prosper, only bitches gossip
Take dick to your tonsils, all my niggas hostile
Real niggas don't be acting so we ain't have no role models
Die for a gold chain, kill for a gold bottle
From where rap niggas don't blow up, old niggas don't grow up
Fast money then slowed up, niggas die, police don't show up
Nigga, my life is a movie like I'm ready for my close up
Big and Pac in eternal sleep, I wish I could wake them both up
I don't quit, I don't stop, nigga rest only test my patience
If sleep is the cousin of death, then me and that bitch ain't no relation
I don't do it for the trophy, shit, I do it for the glory
I'm a fly city survivor, I survived to tell our story

[Interlude]
The path of the righteous man is beset on all sides by the iniquities of the selfish and the tyranny of evil men. Blessed is he, who in the name of charity and good will, shepherds the weak through the valley of darkness, for he is truly his brother's keeper and the finder of lost children. And I will strike down upon thee with great vengeance and furious anger those who would attempt to poison and destroy my brothers. And you will know I am the Lord when I lay my vengeance upon thee

[Verse 2: Jon Connor]
Don't nobody love me, my back is so bloody
So many knives to my back won't let you close enough to cut me
Niggas say they feel me can't let you close enough to touch me
Haters on my dick I can't let you pussy niggas fuck me
Must be clear, I won't fall, all you motherfuckers clumsy
I'm a soldier, your Full Metal Jacket's kinda rusty
Old soul for a nigga my age, I'm trapped nigga, stuck in my ways
True artist, y'all garbage, fuck nigga don't litter my stage
I'm still here like D-Money took that shot for me
I'm still here like Maserati take this shot with me
Still won't see the day that Mo Cleaves is not with me
These niggas y'all be on don't make my top fifty
Lil' nigga I was born in a war zone
Fuck the world like I can't control my hormones
Tried to ignore my skill but y'all niggas can't fuck with me still
The game ain't give me shit so I'mma take it against they will
