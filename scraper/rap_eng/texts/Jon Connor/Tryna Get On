So it's this what y'all been waiting for
Telling me low we just can't take no more
Hoops is lace, eat my face, and a place in the world
I ain't gonna go if I wanna, gonna, end up on your corner
Grown up, with a couple of nigga on a mission
You can end up missin
Gonna blow a little meeting, this mind's a man
Time to win, lost a lot, feeling as strong as an ox
Could probably toss with rocks across the block, off the top
Find the softest spot, shoot to kill
Life is selfless rot
So my life post the lot, do this real
If y'all ain't noticed, I'm focused
But niggas broke focus with niggas
Ain't wrote one rap out of spect
When I act like I own you my bindess with bizness
Got all these people thinking I'm rich and shit
Like this is it, like I got some instant hit
Man I'm just tryina get position, shit

[Hook]
So don't worry bout my pay, what I make, doing good
But if my mama still in the hood then what you think
I'm tryna get on, I'm just tryna get on, I'm just tryna get on
Don't ask me if I got a million dollars
You see me out in the drought, just shake my hand and holler
I'm tryna get on, I'm just tryna get on, I'm just tryna get on

[Jon Connor]

I don't really care how you feel about rap
Matter fact, I don't care how you feel about that
That's my frowl nigga get about that
Never give a second to the present my drop
At the game, hijack
I ask, I ask who better right now
Not none, not never
Niggas couldn't spit like me, if my mouth was dry
And my tongue got severed
'should I only need 2 letter
When I say fuck uh, then your girl get wetter
Niggas try to stay afloat, but I made a boat
When I hit every wave, I cope'
Oh you talking to a motherfucking genius

Hold that, niggas know when I'm hold back
Front row on the show, where the hoes at
Any nigga know kinda better, better know that
Bitch nigga on fire, where the hoes at
Wait, wait, so cold, 'I make all you niggas can't trace, a blank state
Sound like a problem, sound like a ho, let me count on my sound
Like a gyzmo thousand
Talking that shit, haters all on my dick
All they do is arouse me
Better call rap tousin, feeling like 80k how my heart be
Why I act like this, we just tryna get on
That's why I rap like this, gone!

[Hook]
So don't worry bout my pay, what I make, doing good
But if my mama still in the hood then what you think
I'm tryna get on, I'm just tryna get on, I'm just tryna get on
Don't ask me if I got a million dollars
You see me out in the drought, just shake my hand and holler
I'm tryna get on, I'm just tryna get on, I'm just tryna get on

Nigga we the best out, but I keep my chest out
Cause sometimes I feel like left out, when the game's stretched out
Y'all know what I mean, this routine
Speak to the streets, and they sleep till you release them charts
And once you start to eat, they gonn think that you weak
And you lost your heart
This is insane, crazy just ain't the word
The right description, that's fiction
That's an understatement, that's basic
Nigga this is a mission to be great
It ain't no decision, it's just fate
At least for tito, I ain't break these doors down
Just to get pussy like carlito
I don't see no negro, Caucasian, latin or asian
It's amazing, I'm brazing, as a kid that's spend all of his days'
Gazing the
Stars, raising kids that weren't his
And just blazing, aging so fast, he ain't gonn last
What they thought on occasion
Hit by them straisin, excuse my phrasing
But fuck the bullshit, these bullets raging
It's a war that's waging, what side are you on nigga
What god you praising? Ha?
