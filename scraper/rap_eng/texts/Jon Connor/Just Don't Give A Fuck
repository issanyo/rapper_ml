[Verse 1]
Who's back? Do you have to ask
Fire, I'm the gas and match
I dance with the devil; every track, I do the Cabbage Patch
I'm in the wrong habitat
A lion in a rabbit match
You the dude on the mat
Getting elbowed in a Randy Savage match
Imagine that -- you in a bandage wrap, y'all should have backed off
Thought you was losing your mind, now your head getting hacked off
Your baby momma wack -- you'd have been better if you'd have jacked off
Now your kid like your car -- niggas asking, "How much did that cost?"
Never satisfied, I say my best line's my next line
I got Sav and Mo's phones blowing up like a request line
The same stage I rock'll be the one that I get killed on
That means I'll die in the blink of a eye
For what hip-hop was built on
A king, so watch the throne like this is Kanye with a kilt on
Feed off respect, I'm hungry -- that's the reason I keep going
The scary part about all this is that I'm still growing
Planted a seed of doubt in niggas' minds, now it's a field growing

[Hook]
Best in the world, you say I'm not
Even though my shit is hot every time I drop?
I just don't give a fuck
Get on the blogs, leave comments hating on all of my songs?
Well, fuck y'all
I just don't give a fuck
They try to hate like they can't see that I'm great
Well, go ahead and save face
I just don't give a fuck
Cause I'm here to bring the pain
With my middle finger to the game cause
I just don't give a fuck

[Verse 2]
I don't give a fuck if you don't like me
What if I don't like you?
I ain't ask your opinion on what beats you think I should write to
Before I do, I'll be suicidal watching American Idol
At my head with a rifle while I'm quoting the Bible
This rap shit is draining me like lipo
Going psycho cause half the time I can't remember what the fuck I write for
I ain't just good, I'm a God -- that's a typo
With Jon Connor, one thing you should believe is the hype, bro
This is the evolution, more like the execution
Rappers got prices on they head like I'm selling humans
I'm just selling music, them niggas selling stupid
And y'all buy it; it's confusing like a Rubik's Cube is
But I just move through it
I got my own agenda
I'm making dinner out contenders and I won't surrender
Niggas make records about me that I don't remember
Cause I'm too busy being me so fuck you, nigga

[Hook]
