I was in the hood dreaming about a million, a million
I was in the hood dreaming about a million dollars
I was in the hood dreaming about a million, a million
I was in the hood dreaming about a million dollars

All my niggas is
Throw them One's in the sky, tell them hoes that they gone, gone, gone, gone, one, one, one
Throw them One's in the sky, tell them hoes that they gone, gone, gone, gone, one, one, one

I was in the hood dreaming about a million dollars
I was in the hood dreaming about a million dollars

[Verse 1: Jon Connor]
Late nights, bright lights
All my life, what I've done lived for
I'm in love with all this shit, but I can't forget what I'm here for
Bad hoes in the nudes, tabloids, interviews
My rap life is my real life
But it's still life, I don't get confused
People say I'm lucky but shit I just think it's funny
Got these bad stripper-chick and when she fucks me says she loves me
I'm in NYC on sunday, and ATL on monday
Get texts from my exes, soon as the airplane hit the runway
And yep, I know it's fake
But I just say it's faked
Running back into these hoes that tried to play me to my face
And who the nudie rounds I just to write, would be my save and grace
Why they say revenge is sweet, well they about to get a taste for the days that

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Kid ink]
I said I got to go and get it
Ain't nobody to wait on
Dreaming about a million in the hood, like Trayvon
Remember when a nigga didn't have a bed to lay on
Now it's rack city stacks seize up about to pray on
Even when they didn't believe, I had no doubt like we know
Time like casinos going pour another glass up
Peach CÃ®roc for my haters, it's such a sweet revenge
Rolling up and [?] sweet excuse
How I spend every day just running from these models
You know how the story goes, more money more problems
Yelling like I'm sitting so high
On top of the world, but I came from the bottom

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Jon Connor
Boss shit on overload
Vike it in so I don't explode
You tripping on that redbone and that brown skin, I got both of those
Looking like they fresh out of Forbes
After party's right after shows
Nas chicks my momma age, Madonna age, tell them strike a pose
Hoes from the cuts hoping that I notice
But I don't because I'm just too focused
If we don't make moves, it's a must that we stay in motion
Folks smile like they know me now
Shake hands like they owe me, wow
Bad hoes want to blow me now
Fast life trying to slow me down
But I won't let it, shit I won't stop until they give me that credit
A nigga ain't sweet, borderline diabetic
Try me and dead is, that's where you're headed
Fly City's what raised me, can't forget that's who made me
Until I'm gone it's AV because ain't none of this shit going to change me
