I tell 'em taking on the world, that don't scare me though
There ain't nothing that my mama ain't prepared me for
Just when I was gonna say fuck it with this music shit
I remember I'm the plague of all this stupid shit
They hear my voice I give 'em hope with every chord I write
Greatness come in time I swear my shit ain't happen overnight
I love a hater cause without you love don't exist
And if I left it up to y'all I'd be broke as shit
In every line you hear my heart the more I pour it out
The more that y'all in doubt
About these weak rappers, kill 'em all, and let you all sort 'em out
This is hard work, I keep the grass cut, so I can see snakes coming
Everyday I'm doing yardwork, I let you niggas shine
I was right in time, I know I'm gonna get mine
But you gon' find in every line I rhyme this shit you can't define
This is passion to the day I'm in my casket, when I'm gonna need the roses
I was underneath y'all noses
All this time. The door gets closed, but I stay focused
Did I say focused, I meant ferocious
Shit there was times I was damn near homeless
But I kept going so they can't act like I'm a nigga they don't know, shit
They got me going crazy, all the losses I done took
Y'all ain't got enough to pay me
I feel like the game owe me
More money, more problems, don't believe it nigga show me
I guess this how it's gotta be
But lonely nights on the mic that made a believer out of me
I'm still screaming no apologies
The people's rapper yeah I'm proud to be
You are what you allow to be
All my people follow me
I don't want you all to go down with me
Cause I will find a way out if a fucking army surrounded me
Make 'em all regret the day they fucked up and tried to target me
Why they ever start with me, know your words ain't harming me
I'mma give you all of me, each and every part of me
Until there ain't no heart of me
This what I think about while you were sleeping
