[Hook: Sizzla]
It's been a journey
Trail of blood, sweat and tears
I never worry
Because I am no failure
I am a warrior
Yes I am a warrior

[Verse 1: David Banner]
To Doc Rivers and the Clippers: Sterling basically called us niggers
Called us slaves in some J's shooting J's
We got made to look weak, they offered him 2 bill' in 2 weeks
That's Microsoft pimping
We still played and lost, shirts flipped like Kris Kross
Adam Silver looked like a boss
I wish we would've just walked off and walked into history
George Zimmerman still walking around that's a mystery
But I guess we some rebels with no flags
Seven shots to the ruby red rebels I'm burning your ass
Falsified European history burned in your class
Raping little kids in the name of God, burn in your mass
I'm a fire waterboy, burning your flask
Catch us burning that, turn it on your ass for burning my past
And while I'm burnin', fuck Vuitton and Louis
This for Malcolm and Patrice, Medgar Evers and Huey

[Hook: Sizzla]
It's been a journey
Trail of blood, sweat and tears
I never worry
Because I am no failure
I am a warrior
Yes I am a warrior

[Verse 2: N.O.R.E.]
You see I started out with no money in my account
Didn't matter though, had street cred, see that's collateral
Gym stars raises machete swords and lasers
I know chicks now that's living like Griseldas
Selling pots since the first Legend of Zeldas
Lets reverse the roll, rewind things and move back a bit
This industry is for the addicts not dealers that accurate
Everybody molly, lean or percocet
They gangbangin' throwing up signs and all claiming sects
Monkey see, monkey do, guess it's all true
You original, that's criminal, dumb niggas will copy you
Them young niggas saying slime never give me props
I don't direct 'em cause I leave that job for your pops
Your moms have my poster on they wall
Young man, that love doesn't dissolve
You love me or hate me, it's cool it rubbed off

[Hook: Sizzla]
It's been a journey
Trail of blood, sweat and tears
I never worry
Because I am no failure
I am a warrior
Yes I am a warrior

[Verse 3: Jon Connor]
It's been a journey I wouldn't let it deter me
Either I'mma make it or get carried out on a gurney
You know that same story, starving artist been through the darkest
Parts of my life, tryna fight for this mic and they can't ignore me
The up-downs and in my town had to duck rounds -- stressful
For the limelight get your mind right, when the time's right it'll test you
And what don't kill you, it'll make you stronger look believe that
And yea this life'll whoop your ass sometimes but we need that
Ego never feed that 'specially from the feedback
Of these cats that help, you so blind you won't perceive that
Jealously's the downfall of every team
Everybody say they love you but it's only few that really mean that
You take chances when you shake hands
Your real niggas turn out to be fake friends
Be ready to switch it up anytime that you make plans cause they do go awry
Shit make it or die trying, that's for you to decide for real

[Hook: Sizzla]
It's been a journey
Trail of blood, sweat and tears
I never worry
Because I am no failure
I am a warrior
Yes I am a warrior
