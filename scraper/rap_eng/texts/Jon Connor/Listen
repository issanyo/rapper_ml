[Hook: Matthew Koma]
Listen to your heart for your god's sake
You'll move a mile
I'll answer all the prayers that your lips place
Corrupt Bible eyes

[Verse 1: Jon Connor]
AVM right? Look

Think about all the things I've seen
Think about the places I've been
Thinking that I wanna run this rap shit
And I'm in the rap race
And I'm thinking about the place I'm in

No second place I win
Wait let me catch my wind
Pour it on thick when your skin's too thin
Feeling like I'm hanging from a limb
You don't wanna see my vision
Well homie let me correct your lense

Fuck nigga get on
I woulda did anything just to get on
I used to say I was the shit
Then they played me like I ain't shit
Then the same niggas I'ma shit on

Cause instead of getting pissed off
It was countdown and lift off
Now the haters looking at me
Like they trying to win it
It's tough when I cut their wrist off
Now when I say "jump" niggas looking like Kriss Kross

Gotta be blessed
Cause if you think this the strategy guess
You won't believe my mentality packed with regrets
And insanity it's just a fantasy, well

Trapped in a shell
I feel like I'm trapped in this Hell
Convict that's back in a cell
Biting my nails
On the road to riches
But I feel like the Devil is hot on my trail

I'm consumed with getting to the place that I wanna be
But I ain't there
Somebody told me that life ain't fair
But I ain't them and they ain't here

Nightmares living my dream
But I don't sleep so I don't care
I look fear in the face I anytime I'm in the booth
And I ain't scared, BUH!

[Hook] x2

[Verse 2: SRH]
Yeah! I gotta speak truth
I gotta let it all go 'till it's see-thru
You think these motherfuckers want it? Well me too, yeah me too
I'm too cold for 'em, couldn't heat you

I got a little bit of energy saved
They're saying I'm ahead of my game and that I'm headed for fame
I just want you to remember my name
Couldn't care about the paper 'till it's made

Yeah, can't touch it
Give them hell boy, never kick the bucket
I gotta give them all gold 'till they can't stomach
Anything I've ever put out, finna slam dunk it
I put my hand up it like a damn puppet

You really want to be me, motherfucker?
I don't think you really got dreams, motherfucker
Let it be, motherfucker
I'm a beast, motherfucker
I'm a treat, motherfucker's like a tree, motherfucker

It's the only way to do it
Never lie to me, never do it in my music
I'm a real boss, ready give me money I'ma use it
And my team ball out, out of bounds, shootin'

Follow my heart, never been about the money
If it was, I'd be out here getting paid stuntin'
All these paid checks but I never really loved it
So you gotta understand why I risk it all for nothing, Yeah!

Follow me and I'ma make my mark
Lifes calling me, I'ma play my part
Made my colony, never faked my art
Give you all me, finna make my start

Finna break this star like it's all on me
Listen to my heart, man it's all I see
Out of all my dreams it's the one that I'm bleeding
Money come and go boy, but it go for a reason
You gotta

[Verse 3: Maffew Ragazino]
Game, Yeah, It's Senior!

All I wanna do is be great
And I ain't even tryna to wait (wait)
Never been a nigga to play it safe
I put it all on the line out of confidence
Yessir I got a whole lotta faith

Can't ever win it big if there ain't no risk
Gotta fight that fight even though the shit's fixed
Look, if you wanna right you gotta do it like this
My OG told me never look back so I never reminisce

I keep pressing on, keep gringing on
Full speed, left lane with my blinders on
Never got to get ready I was born ready
And I pace shit, gotta make sure my time is on

And I want to live forever
Is that too much to ask for?
'Fuck you niggas think I rap for?
To push a Toyota Avalon?

Fanbase growing legs now
New people are catching on
Niggas wanna steal my thunder
But can't emulate my perfect storm

Frank the Butcher Adidas Forms
Topless Hilfigger my jeans are foreign
Top 5, dead or alive it's all me me me
Cause your favorite MC's are boring
