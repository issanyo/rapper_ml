[Verse 1: Jon Connor]
Who wanna see where the fuck I'm from?
Let's take a trip so you can see just how far I've come
From where making it out is like you breaking out of a cell
From where real niggas did either got shot up or in jail
Rap niggas talk about murder, but murder is not for talking
If niggas was talking in my hood, then them niggas is barely walking
You tryna swim with the sharks but you niggas is soft as a dolphin;
You rapping and you ain't 'bout action
You acting, you Dustin Hoffman, you stuntin' Steve Austin also
You outta proceed with caution
Cops'll run in your house, yellow tape around your apartment;
Money under the matress, dope up under the carpet
Get caught quick
I seen hoes get niggas wet up
Pillow talk with you missus, this bitch is part of the set up
Niggas is plottin', niggas is rotten they kill they own folks
No respect for shit niggas cussin' in front of old folks
Grown folks is part of the problem, part of the gossip
Instigatin' is this the deciding factor in why they got shot up
My auntie still play the number and hoping she hit the lotto
So she could get dressed up and take that trip to Chicago
Tires screech in the night and gunshots immediately follow
I know niggas in condos that solve they problem with [?]
Everyday conversation could lead to interrogation
A barbershop confrontation could lead to incarceration
Being ratchet is a religion 'cus they don't know nothing different
And bitches just being bitches, they bitching about they business
She seen it, she know who did it, a witness;
Good thing she didn't believe in snitching, cus if she do
Consequences relentless
Baggy jeans, long tee's, big coats, fitted hats
Country hood, civic hood, fuck it where my niggas at?
Westpad, Pearson Hood, Mearl Hood, Shelby hood [??????]
Every hood that took a loss wish we could get our niggas back
Figure that my nigga then you figure every niggas' strap
Can't relax they just react, be careful how your niggas act
So I'm putting on, Fly City is my home, 'till the day that I'm gone
Uh uh ohn

[Hook: Jon Connor]
And here's another hit, Barry Bonds
[hey hey hey hey hey hey]
We outta here baby
We outta here baby
JC so outta here baby!
Yeah!

[Verse 2: Justin Daye]
I used to sing in the choir
Unlike others the shit I wore wasn't the cleanest attire
Told niggas that I could rap, I was seen as a liar
Now I'm out in Cali with broken[?] everything I desire
I'm more, Jackie than Barry Bonds
A pioneer to a city of people holding on
The typical story of a home with a single mom
Knowing life would be better if Papa wasn't gone
If 'Pac and Big wasn't dead I probably would call 'em Dad
The substitutes for the father I really never had
Not to exaggerate the situation
I used to visit, he even came to my graduation
In elementary I had his interest and admiration
For writing lyrics, now I'm dependent on entertainment to make a living
'Cus Eminem said "Lose Yourself in the moment"
And never expect to get a favor back when you loan it
Success is a bitch because she never comes when you want it
Just know it exists
It's relief like letting it out, when you holding a piss
Truth be told I could give a fuck about a top five list
I got two friends in the grave
Mamma feel like a slave
Sister going to school, and I'm really proud of her grades
And me, I'm trying to escape the nightmare of minimum wage
Cus lyrically, I think I'm the illest nigga my age
But two hundred projects from rap niggas are released every day
So shit...

[Hook: Justin Daye]
Ha ha ha
[hey hey hey hey hey hey]
We outta here baby
Uh
We outta here baby
Uh
We outta here baby!
