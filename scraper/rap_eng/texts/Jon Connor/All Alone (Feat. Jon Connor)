[Hook 1: Bailey]
I can't do this on my own, no
I need someone for when I'm alone, so
Could you just pick up your phone, oh
And tell me when you'll be home
I can't do this on my own, no
I need someone for when I'm alone, so
Could you just pick up your phone, oh
And tell me when you'll be home



[Verse 1: Rowlan]
I'm looking, and searching, and reaching out for some guidance
And when we chase a dream we chase so hard till no one's beside us
Like we
Got no need for no family for friends
I'm saving money for music and food
Like Fuck a trend
I mean
I been starving, I'm hungry enough to bite the bullet
I'm looking around at my old friends asking who gon pull it
And they don't know either
Cause' they were never there
That's my imagination
Trying to make me care
Cause I'm a lonely soul
Chasing the dream I'm meant to chase
I never find time to sleep
Never mind time to ponder hate
I guess the message is that even when you lonely
You better off that way then around some friends who phoney
I'm talking to the top, saying I am on my way
I'm a grateful, hungry artist, just Asking the world for a play
I'm just telling you, chase that Dream, and keep that faith
And know what you are aiming for, ten times more then whats at stake


[Hook 2: Bailey]
I can't do this on my own, no
I need someone for when I'm alone, so
Could you just pick up your phone, oh
And tell me when you'll be home
I can't do this on my own, no
I need someone for when I'm alone, so
Could you just pick up your phone, oh
And tell me when you'll be home





[Verse 2: Jon Connor]
Look
At times your dream can seem so far away, that you can't reach it
The drive you have inside, can't be denied, or kept a secret
All the days you work, all the times you hurt
All the times you thinking is this dream, causing more pain then what its worth
Look
No-one can relate, and no you can't escape
Trapped in your ambition, no decision guess its fate, is it too late?
Hungry, but you not satisfied by whats put on your plate
Keep on going when you can't see it we achieve it through our faith
It's so hard to feel encouraged its so easy to get discouraged
When it seem everything, is in our way to test our courage
Yeah the world with test your heart, risk it all just for the art
Life ain't bout what you learn, its what you knew right from the start
See
Failure's not an option, and success is not a choice
Success is the only option, so your struggle has a voice
So when you look in the mirror and you don't know what do
The answers right there, never fails, its in you
That's real


[Hook 3: Bailey]
I can't do this on my own, no
I need someone for when I'm alone, so
Could you just pick up your phone, oh
And tell me when you'll be home
I can't do this on my own, no
I need someone for when I'm alone, so
Could you just pick up your phone, oh
And tell me when you'll be home
