[Verse 1]
Who can you trust when people have an agenda
When niggas turn into bitches for riches they switch they gender
When the check came, it was like a sex change for these motherfuckers
Ugly colors under what was once the one you called your brother
Jealousy hides it never shows itself
Its nature is to hate can only be fake for so long before it expose itself
I ain't in competition with rappers whoever can kill shit
Although I kill shit, I'm just good I'm giving you real shit
First off, ladies if you wanna keep a friend, don't tell a bitch about your business and don't bring around your man
Cuz y'all be getting too comfortable, talking about he cuddle you, how he be fucking you
Now she want your man to fuck her too
Look, that's your fault, now that's your fault
The only way a seed can grow is from you planting a thought
A best friend can be a deadly enemy they know your weakness, know your secrets
Know the time she had caught him when he was cheatin'
And this grimy bitch like, girl that's more reason for you to leave him why she secretly sneakin' out to go see him
And I don't give a fuck if it's your cousin or your mom if a bitch get naked, a nigga dick get hard
We can stop all the silly shit tell your sister to walk through the room in her drawers and you'll see who your nigga really is
Way I look at it is it simple mathematics, some bitches so petty they just want shit just to have it
Meaning nigga's get horny, baby that's just being honest
And she don't really want him, she just want him cuz you got him
Friends are easy targets because you always around em so the slightest doubt or problem turn a mole hill to a mountain
I done seen it all, I done see hoes crying, I done see em go so hard they forgot that they was lyin'
Story so crazy, like I can't believe he about to try it
A nigga head's so gone know she wrong still he buy it
It's just a figment of our imagination it could be a modern trust not a fraction of what it should be
People get caught up in logic, people still fight to say you right
Make up excuses is the truth still don't make it right
Watch who you trust, watch who let in
Seldom them the ones you started are the ones you left in the end
And I watch these snakes, and I watch they face cuz no matter how much they grin
The more you take the more they hate, and the more you let in
It's a revolving cycle, until the day we turn back to dust
People they come and go so I guess we'll never
Who can you trust
