[Verse 1]
Is he hood? Is he conscious? They ask about Jon
Is he Pop, or Hip-Hop? But I'm not to be boxed in
I'm not for the bondage, this shit is just nonsense
Like I can only go so far with my content
And no, it ain't hate, but I just can't take
All the bullshit they make, and we act like it's great
Big and Pac is like we spit, in they face, wanna burn
Every radio station that makes us embrace it
So now being fake, take you straight to the bank
So they can't rap and think, that's the path they should take
While the talent get wasted, while I try to change it
The art steady dying, we awake to a waitress
Think how it feel, if you lower your skill
Then you might get a deal, man this shit is unreal
O.G.s tryna speak out I feel where they coming from
Then they shut 'em down and say "Oh, it's cause you ain't young"
Well I guess I don't get it, cause you young, mean you dumb?
No, it means you got fed the same shit 'till you numb
And these words from my tongue got the power of a gun
I can kill these tracks, or your dreams, either one
And that's why I'm responsible
What I'm watching, they make me so sick, and this booth is my hospital
Concrete rose, and you watching me blossom
And no, they can't stop 'em, cause that's not a option

[Hook]
Cause I am, whatever you say I am
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am?
In the paper, the news, every day I am
Radio won't even play my jams
Cause I am, whatever you say I am
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am?
In the paper, the news, every day I am
I don't know, this is the way I am

[Verse 2]
So from they point of view, they keep saying I'm new
Been spitting since twelve, so I'm just new to you
So don't talk to me about paying dues
When I prove I'm consume with the mood of refusing the lose
Had to deal with these assholes, that would talk down
I'm on MTV too, I don't hear 'em talking now
Sometimes inside, yes, I'm about to buy
The reason why my city have more pride if I lie
If I said that I shot twenty guys, and they died
But I didn't, so I don't, so at times I'm despised
Niggas say they want real, well how's that defined?
Bottom line, couldn't be more real if I tried
So here's what I'mma do: point the finger at you
Why don't you really take notice who you looking up to?
Cause if he's in the club with these hoes, and he's rapping
Then how is he shooting, and dealing, and trapping?
It's y'all that be dying, y'all that be losing
Y'all be confusing the truth with this music
I got a gift, and I will not abuse it
I will not change for no-one, I refuse it

[Hook]
