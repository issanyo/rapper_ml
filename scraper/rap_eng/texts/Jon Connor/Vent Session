When I was playing Tom Sawyer, the world seemed so big
I was feeling like Verne Troyer couldn’t wait to get older
It ain’t too many me's I can see is I get wiser
Still going full speed for my dreams while you get tired
Made my own company hated waiting to get hired
While you all work a job that you hate till you get fired
I know that I’m the truth so these rappers see me like liars
That’s why I only listen to me to keep me inspired
And can’t y’all see that I’m spitting more than saliva
Giving you revelations feel like you thumbed through a bible
And songs are like Psalms it's like he's reading your palms
Proceed to eating this evening as I’m just feedin’ your thoughts
I was raised in the hood so how could I ever endorse a lifestyle
That will take your child and won’t even speak of remorse
Your speak of hood shit like it’s cool but then of course
You niggas ain’t satisfied till you niggas end up a corpse
And I can have it on my conscience I ain’t by the gun
But to me I feel like I pull the trigger to my content
And Jon sits in the position to change shit I grew up
Around niggas and bitches that ain’t shit
What I seen growing up sure enough was horrifying
Lost my pops to dope how could I glorify it
You could say what you like and don’t like about what I write
I was born premature I’ve been fighting all of my life
So the purposes through these verses to give them hope
That they ain’t getting in churches, cause pastor's life contradicting the sermon
Children without a father, mama wanna be like daughter, daughter wanna be like mama
See what's getting me bother, fuck niggas get money is the only thing that she taught her
So if I raised my daughter right she’s a lamb lead to the slaughter
And call me not even through these words that I write
I think I’ma change something silence ain't gon' change nothing
Fuck money, cause money ain’t the issue, it don’t buy happiness
And buy a bunch of shit you can’t take with you
I’m 25 so this ain't for you and me this for little dude
In his teens and his eyes glued to the screen
And he’s watching videos and he could mimic every scene
He don’t know the difference between what’s real and what he seeing
A tv got us disillusion like we all ain’t human beings what you want me to spit about
The same shit that came out, that nigga mouth
I wasn’t raised in that nigga house
So I never act like, rap like, fuck it, be whack like another nigga
I can only ever be me, and as long as I’m living
That’s all you’ll ever gonna see
Understand I don’t do this for conversation
Please visit my city you’ll understand my frustration
This is coming from a place that you can never comprehend
Cause at the End of the Road boys don’t grow to be men since
Nobody else got the courage to question what we encourage
I'll spark the conversation through controversy in verses
Just look at how our past look, and look at shit now
For not giving a fuck the whole world need they ass whooped
No I’m not a saint hell no I’m not a virgin and
I am not the pope and I damn sure ain’t perfect
But I know that any life that I could touch is worth it
And I’m leaving my mark on this world shit I’m determined
To show y'all everybody here has a purpose
So always know your worth even when the world say you’re worthless
The future sitting there what you wait for just grab it
And always be yourself homie cause it ain’t nobody better at it

Nah, ain’t nobody better at it, for real
Vent Session it’s the people’s rapper
It's another one for my blog niggas, love nigga
Sometimes you need shit like this
Turn this shit up loud so the car next to you can hear this shit
Them niggas need to hear this shit too
Don’t never expect one thing from me my whole career you gonna be disappointed
I’ma keep making what the fuck I wanna make
I’m an artist I’ma keep giving y'all art, I promise
Just sit back and watch me paint
I does it for the people, I give the people some shit to talk about
Every time I do nigga, be on lookout, Salvation niggas Reef I see you
Vinnie Chase Season 2
I’ma keep the world talking nigga, I’ma keep the worlkd talking nigga
