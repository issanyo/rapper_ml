On the beat I am a criminal
So this beat fits me like prison clothes
Killing flows making sure chicken heads leave pigeon toed
Pinnacle when I pin a flow like
Don juan when he pimp a hoe
If you in the know this will cease everyones attempts to blow
Rappers is fictional say something I find offensive woo!
We gone see how bout it flint is when its bad feelings are provoked
I represent them cold nights when so-po some days we ain't had no lights
So many cops up and down the block shit look like strobe lights
I don’t care about your budget or how much you buzzin you frontin
When I see you out in public that cabbage turn to a pumpkin
That ain't cool points that’s fool points
I am not amused fake dudes say real talk but see I am not confused
Hear the concrete that’s the streets talking and
When that happen Homie keep walking
Yall dead weight like cheap coffin
Flow sick and I keep coughing
Anybody want it they can get it
They complain about who the realist in their lyrics
Ill admit im authentic everything I spit I did it
For the people that are riding with me
This is more than music this is more than those true hits
This is for the dudes who abuse this shit spit that trash
And keep making us look so stupid
I knew it spineless mindless
I know hear me shining spitting diamonds timeless
It’s the peoples rapper guess its time now for me to break my silence
And now they know exactly where to find me
