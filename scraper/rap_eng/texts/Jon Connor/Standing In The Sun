(Verse 1)
(Jon Connor)
My vision, mean intervention
Now my persistence is a sickness
Reach for the sky feel like I'm within inches
Conflicted, love my addiction can't live without it
Crowded cause even doubters wanna be around me
And vision, when you think you've finished
There's still a void you can't avoid
It's something missing
The tension feel like I'm Nixon, wanna say fuck it
But I'm frontin' it's the only day I can make love with

(Hook)
(Craig Owens, Lia Mack)
Standing in the sun
Lying by the lights
Now I see the changes I believe
I think I'm wrong and out of time
If you were right
What if I was wrong instead
If you were here with me
I guess we'll never know

(Verse 2)
(Jon Connor)
It's not a girl saying
Who is that,behind them tits
I can't see him, they like could it be him?
And I'm thinking should it be them
They get picked up in the AM
And be leaving by the PM or dawn
Least then the PM it's my dream and I ain't sleeping
But the heights here, is a nightmare
Even when the sky clear
Blinded,but when them eyes clear
Be cautious it ain't no signs here
It ain't no signs here,it ain't no signs here
See the curtain and what's behind here
It's like you definite it ain't no sings here

(Hook)

(Verse 3)
(Jon Connor)
In my basement my thoughts is basin'
I wanna make it, I wanna make it
But I learned succes is what you make it
Just take it steal the moment and now you own it
You scared? then leave it there how bad you want it
Now my life is something to dissect, ain't nothing private
But I wish this hope didn't play it was for you to see crying
And this is the closest that we'll ever get
Even if you touch me I'm still distant
You wanna feel me? then listen
I'm falling

(Bridge)
(Craig Owens)
What do you believe
When I seem so far away
I can feel it in my dreams
Even when I'm wide awake
It's ta-ta-taking over
It's ta-ta-taking over me
It's ta-ta-taking over
It's ta-ta-taking over me

(Hook)

(Bridge x2)
(Lia Mack)
What do you believe
When I seem so far away
I can feel it in my dreams
Even when I'm wide awake
It's ta-ta-taking over
It's ta-ta-taking over
It's ta-ta-taking over me
It's ta-ta-taking over me
It's ta-ta-taking over me
