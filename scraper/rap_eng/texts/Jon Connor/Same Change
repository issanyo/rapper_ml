[Verse 1]
So I roll through the hood just to see what's poppin'
Same shit as when I was little man this shit ain't stopping
Young niggas telling me what on the world they can be
I tell them slow down but they tell me it's not an option
And lil mama walking down you see, with nothing on
She's 17 but you can tell this girl and she ain't grown
Her other girls walking up and down the block
Working on baby number two but barely take care of the one she got
They talking shit up in the barber shop
They tellin' me 'bout who got clocked and now who getting locked
We hear this shit about every day so we just press not
One of our homies laying down going inside a box
The newspaper telling me one of my homies gone
But we so numb too it we don't find time to mourn
So they day by day seem like the same shit on the front page
A different phase but it seem the story never change,never change

[Hook]
The more they change,the more they stay the same
The more they stay the same,the more they stay the same
Never can go back to the way things used to be
Some things never ch-,some things never change
Oh some things never change

[Verse 2]
So we stay off the scenes way before we ready
So a son hates his father though he never met him
For the same reason father end up hating son
And he can't raise a man probably cause he was never one
And now we running with the homies as he older
Got a trip on his shoulder now we making mistakes
Do the shit that papa ain't show 'em
Chicks he's gettin' 'em off, now they toppin' 'em off
Yeah he hit 'em and quit 'em before we droppin' 'em off
Cause ain't nobody ever stressing,he never learned his lesson
About going inside dresses wearing no protection
See it don't take a genius to see she will end up pregnant
But she was fucking everybody so it ain't no telling
And now he man enough to say he ain't ready for kids
And he ain't about to claim a baby he ain't sure it's his
Keep trying to convience her but she want her boy
And now he's gone like his father before him
Guess some things never change

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
So the street light come on,kids still trying to stay out
Hustlers in the hood still looking for a way out
Old folks on the porch watching how we play out
Summer time in the hood wasn't when it's layed out
Old folks gossiping politics 'bout what's going on
But ain't nobody taking the time to see where we going wrong
They grab the criticise 'em and got 'em like they ain't make mistakes
Instead of teaching them they keep throwing shit in their face
And y'all ain't reaching them cause y'all keep taking them
Defying for no reason like they dying for no reason
Ain't nobody listening so when they tryin' they reaching
You just Mr. Know it all but if you try they still be breathing ,huh
Remember when your parents said that all the music that you listen to
It's stupid , turn it down that shit is foolish well
Put yourself back in them shoes,cause today's kids is just like you
So things never change
