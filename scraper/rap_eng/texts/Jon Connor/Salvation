[Intro]
This is Jon Connor
If you're listening to this, you are the resistance
Jon Connor, we got to find this guy

[Hook: Jon Connor]
Tell them niggas that I'm coming
If they love me, come and get me
And hell coming with me
Tell them niggas that I'm coming
If they love me, come and get me
And hell coming with me, nigga

It ain't nothing they can do
I ain't got nothing to lose
So I'm coming and hell coming with me, nigga
Homie don't get it confused
I'm lacing up my shoes and I'm running
The world coming with me, nigga

[Verse 1: Jon Connor]
A man's will and drive can make him or brake him
One man's will inside gon' influence a nation
Make the world feel my pain, like tooth to the facial
As I'm killing this shit, every syllable fatal
Don't write it off, that's just rhyming in music
I'm trying to inspire minds through this music
It's like god designed them to do it
You're feeling chills, every line in this music
I'm the truth, niggas blind, I can prove it
See, I give you eyes through this music

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Jon Connor]
I'm from where people die
When niggas get bored as fuck
In my hood, every other fucking house is boarded up
Imagine that, so I rap
About shit I've seen growing up
Been through hell, grabbed some flames
And I lit the torch for us
I don't give a fuck about your age or your gender or your racial
I spit it for my people who relate to
Being the eyes, we're peas in the pies
This ain't a facade, niggas is fake and I see the mirage

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Jon Connor]
Pressure, fuck pressure
My blood pressure rising
Put on for Fly City
Nigga word to Andre Rison
Word to Mark Ingrram and the statue on that Heisman
It's do or die, you're a lie if you think I planned on dying
Look, I ain't never going to quit that
I ain't never been the one to take orders because I give that
I ain't never sit back
Never asked for a brake, even for a motherfucking Kit-Kat
When the shit crack, I'mma be right there
Aim for the games and the chit-chats
Nigga it's my time and I'm gon' shine
When I leave this bitch I'll be pitch black

[Hook]
