Feelin' like I did it all couldn't've been evolved
If I didn't have a feeling that I was gon' win it all
Game goin' through a change like women on menopause
Niggas ain't shit and this the enema, aww
Fuck you gon' put me in the middle of y'all
When I could point out all your individual flaws
For me puttin' a pause to niggas that all talk
Niggas stand up and gotta give 'em applause
I'm from where niggas get clapped up, wrapped up
Sleepin' on me, nigga your naps up, that's what
I tell these niggas, I'm killin' the game
Until they permanently sleepin' in the back of a black truck
Hurts when the hearse wheel off and your favorite artist get killed off
Nigga I'm on fire and the only exit's sealed off like finding out Superman real stock, real talk I ain't playin' with 'em
Band played as the shit went down, you a stupid mo' fucka
A groupie, you a loser who recruitin' mo' fuckas
I'm in a platoon full of shooters and I'm hungry, whole crew in the oven
Niggas smellin' like cooked food when I'm comin'
Niggas say they run shit but now they just runnin'
Shit, ribs touchin' and you niggas lookin' like food, I gotta put somethin' in my stomach
See I could never be that nigga, that's a flash in the pan cause you need that nigga
Jumpin' on my dick say the illest shit cause a nigga sick, in a second you believe that nigga
This one thing you can trust me on
I'ma say "fuck the world" till I bust me one
Suck me, son, pause, you know what it was
Easily said you get no love
