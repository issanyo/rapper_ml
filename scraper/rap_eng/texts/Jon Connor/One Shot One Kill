Heaving Breathing, Panting
(One Shot One Kill)
Okay

[Verse 1: Snoop Dogg]
Guess who's back, it ain't a fuckin' question
They know the name, bow in the presence of a living legend
Fuck what you heard, it's murda murda, you gon need protection
Some niggas blinded, couldn't see
So look for me to come and give direction
Who hold the crown, it ain't no conversation
Iâ€™m being modest should be silent 'less you payin' homage
Remain the hottest, niggas can't stop us, that's just being honest
And makin' hits, I never had problems much in that department
Don't get me started, don't compare me to the newest nigga
For every one of you, there's a hundred more
And I watch them come and go, my track record ain't coincidental
And these verses is like hearses
Consistently killin' y'all with instrumentals
Tell me, fuck what would y'all do without me?!
Kill yourself for even thinking something crazy 'bout me
I'm like Ali, your fuckin' champ, now watch me rope a dope
Just watch him choke, cause everythin' I drop is dope
Now watch 'em all go up in smoke

[Hook: Jon Connor]
I came here to raise hell, I can't lie
One shot, one kill, it's real, I ain't hidin'
Don't shoot one shot if you ain't ready to die
And never get it fucked up, I got shooters for hire
Cause you don't want it, I have you like aye aye
Better back the fuck up, over guns so I try
Now that weak shit will never slide, I despise
You are now not in the presence of nice guys

[Verse 2: Jon Connor]
Look, what the fuck, I was just chillin' in the cut
Ain't no beginners, only winners run amok, you runners up
You funny fuck like twenty bucks, I know your slut will let me fuck
I told my city "Hold me down," now look how high they hold me up
I'm Kobe clutch, I hold my nuts 'fore I was old enough to cuss
Was kissin' bitches after lunch, now that's a muthafuckin' rush
So by high school I was fuckin' niggas' bitches on the hush
So no questions and no panties is a muthafuckin' must
It's the people's rapper, I ain't no rapper, I'm the rapture
On the mornin' after, you lackin' passion, you ain't rap
You just a wack distraction, I can't relax cause I feel the magic smashin'
Toni Braxton, where your sisters at? Let's get it crackin' (Bo!)
Look, I was young, I was broke, had no hope, so I wrote
That's how I cope, I went hard with no results
New approach, same truth, just get ready, aim, shoot
Then get buried, bang, woof, so they better bring troops
Because...

[Hook: Jon Connor]
I came here to raise hell, I can't lie
One shot, one kill, it's real, I ain't hidin'
Don't shoot one shot if you ain't ready to die
And never get it fucked up, I got shooters for hire
Cause you don't want it, I have you like aye aye
Better back the fuck up, over guns so I try
I had weak shit, we'll never slide, I despise
You are now not in the presence of nice guys

[Outro: Dr. Dre + Jon Connor]
It's fuckin' murder, baby
I'm tryna hurt 'em, baby
I know you heard me, baby
Feel like I'm goin' crazy
It's fuckin' murder, baby
Run, run, run, the cops almost got me
Another tear drop, another motherfuckin' body
Uh, uh, uh, another fuckin' body
Uh, uh, uh, another body
Uh, uh, uh, another body
Uh, uh, uh, another body
Uh, uh, uh, another body
Uh, uh, uh, another fuckin' body, body
