[Verse 1]
Yeah, these niggas so lame, these niggas so lame
You wanna see me ball out, look nigga, peat game
All the ho's so high, they don't remember they name
They so blow, smoking on amnesia yeah!
I used to fuck shit niggas by the bleachers
Fuck the game, I was bread for the brain
Now how the homie get head from a teacher?
Fuck a hater, Imma motherfucking boss
Stay on my dick cause it might get soft
Fly city, fly city, motherfucker one, they separated a nigga mind from his thought
The young nigga so dope nigga O.D., if we ain't fam don't approach me
So high, I'm a totem pole, lord, a nigga might get a nose bleed
All a nigga do is work, I proved it first, y'all niggas sweet
And I ain't eat, let's do desert, I chew you first, remove your skirt
Fuck y'all, no, I really mean that, fuck y'all, room 223
I fuck y'all, your girl can dick ride all night, fucking my nuts off, goddamn

[Hook]
If you got what I want then I got what you need

What to sin for

[Verse 2]
Sarah was her name, Sarah was her name
Mollies was her thing, on that tour bus bathroom
Hitting lines and K
I saw her at first sight, nah-uh, that ain't my thing
She say "give me a couple seconds and I got you on that brain"
I say "cool" she say "cool" and her home girl do the same (word?)
Then came out that bathroom, her eyes on that motherfucking plain
It's that rap life, nigga, that party, that bullshit, my Brooklyn niggas
Cash bodies on hood shit
Now back to my back, look, bitches with the bodies got enough asses
Got the whole motherfucking party
Look, got my girl with me but still I just had to look
We fucking, no discussion cause one look was all it took
Rita Ora, Rita Ora, this ho look like Rita Ora
Now she dying to give me oral plus she dying to get recorded (ah!)

[Hook]

[Outro]
Cause I got what you need

Yeah! Tell me what you need!
Cause I got what you need, I got what you need! (Haha)
