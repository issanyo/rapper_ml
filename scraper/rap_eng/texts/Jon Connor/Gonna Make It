Some survive, some fell, it’s just the way it goes
This that negro spirit, you gotta slay your soul
I’m the lyrical version of …
The only difference is I pull a … Ferrari in the danger zone
I’m some like god’s finest art
His creating big beard upon my face will keep a … wrong
They got me riding with the strap, no safety on
But all we trying to do is make it, what you think we on
Me an Jon Connor, we are rhyming with no gimmicks
This is pure spittage, and our lyrics are all honest
Flow like oceans and rivers you niggas small palms
Small timers, yeah I said I’m addressing all rhymers
Holler, who want drama? We will blow up you niggas pots
It’s the beards we are the bombers, run along and tell your mama
...go and warm Obama, we don’t make it, we gonna take it
You naked with the lamas
I’m gonna make it, no one can stand in my …
I’m gonna make it, I’m gonna hustle hard
I’ma make this rap
It’s Connor, who provoking him, they smoking, I’m doper than opium
Spitting that acid, letting them have it, yeah
Real shit, it’s being demanded
Schooling you niggers I’m getting my masters
Go get a past… murdering verses, they lay in the caskets
Flow out this world, trying to catch them
Better get…
Look, niggas can’t see me, like they in the cheap seats
Not even a sneak peek…
Killing, every track at least 6 feet
When I’m creative…taking my turn
I’m on the road to success, and they taking the turn, look
I’m on my grind I been hustling like a motherfucker
I drive a steak through the heart of all you bloodsuckers
The day walker that mental game at the…
And fuck her like miss parker and nothing can get me off her
I’m feeling like none of these niggas can touch me
Maybe it’s poetic justice or maybe I’m just lucky
But grind till you get it it’s the ultimate lesson
Went from being broke… trading verses with the legends
You feel me?
I’m gonna make it, make it, make it, make it
