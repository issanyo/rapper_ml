The two zigzags

Mister mix

Latatatatahaahaaaa

The hungry hustler

Latatahaahaaaa

Brand new Kakhi's on my ass
Colt 45 in my glass...
Cadillac Coupe Deville
Hit The Corner on three wheel
I got my soundsystem beating real good
Hittin switches while I'm throwin up the hood
I never play the radio
I buy underground from the mom-n-pappa sto'
I cruise late night by the clubs
Smokin on a dub while my woofers just sub
Baby I'm from haddisburg
Those are my Caddies up against the curb
I got gold Daytona's on my car
Sport T-shirts, kakhi's and all stars
I like regular people, not stars...
I don't play areas, just bars

I don't act funny, I don't act funny
Just because I got some money... (2x)
If you lookin for the bomb (2x)
If you lookin for some music (2x)
Well let me help you choose it (2x)

I'm so glad I got my website
I ain't worried bout mtv
I got 20 videos, buy 'em all on dvd
I'm so glad I got my website
I ain't worried bout mtv
I just got my hydraulics
Come on and caddy hop with me!

Caddy hop baby, caddy hop (3x)
Caddy hop baby, you don't stop...

The homies call me afroman
I rap with a live funk band
If you can't buy my music don't sweat
Order it of the internet
I'm never on mtv, but everybody got my cd
I'm never on the radio, but everybody knows afro

You say you looking for some music (2x)
Well let me help you choose it (2x)
If you want the bomb (2x)

I'm so glad I got my website
I ain't worried bout mtv
I got 20 videos, buy 'em all on dvd
I'm so glad I got my website
I ain't worried bout mtv
I just got my hydraulics
Come on and caddy hop with me!

Caddy hop baby, caddy hop (3x)
Caddy hop baby, you don't stop...

Make you caddy hop, at the red light
Don't trip, go ahead, that shit looks tight
Don't pass by the homies, unless you hit the switches
Don't have hydraulics, and act like a bitch!
When you hit the switches get your shine on
Think about the days, you got your grind on
Smokin that weed, drinkin that brew
You like the lowrider? I like the lowrider too!

Caddy hop baby, caddy hop (3x)
It's the bomb! afromanmusic - dot com
