Before I hit the party (baby)
You know i need (what you need man, what you need man, what you need man)
Some coke 45 (baby), and a bag of weed (a bag of weed man, a bag of weed man, a bag of weed man) chorusx2

Friday night, time to party
Smoke marijuana, drink bacardi
Get drunk and I,before I leave
Put my hand on my wrist, push back my sleeve
Look at the time, i'm on my marijuana watch
Got a big thick girl rubbin on my crotch
My marijuana watch reads, 4ro:20
I'm getting fucked up while i make mo' money
The party don't start till 11:30 (porno time, watch so nerdy)
Thin girl with me got a big ol' butt
Whenever i want i can bust a, what
Jump off in the shower, 30 minutes to an hour
Stop out the shower on a thick white cloth
Big boodie bastray tryin me out

Before I hit the party (baby)

You know i need (what you need man, what you need man, what you need man)
Some coke 45 (baby), and a bag of weed (a bag of weed man, a bag of weed man, a bag of weed man) chorusx2

I turned on the music to help me pick, something sick
To keep the girls on my dick
Looked in the closet what did i see, hemp suits lookin back at me
Afroman be dressin pimpalicious, and women find me magicly delicious
Turn up the sterio, hit the blut, slick the fo' fo'
Weed, beer, plastic cup, afroman's pre-game warm up
Do it till the liqor and the weed kick in
My sight get blurry and my edge spin
Now i am offially fucked up
Pour the rest of the beer in my styrofoam cup

Before I hit the party (baby)
You know i need (what you need man, what you need man, what you need man)
Some coke 45 (baby), and a bag of weed (a bag of weed man, a bag of weed man, a bag of weed man) chorusx2
