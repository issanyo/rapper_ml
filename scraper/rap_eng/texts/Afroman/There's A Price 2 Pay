(Chorus)
Yeah, there's a price to pay for the girls you lay
Life's gonna hand you a bill one day
Before your freedom or your life get took
Get a wife or a playboy book
One more time
There's a price to pay for the girls you lay
Life's gonna hand you a bill one day
Before your freedom or your life get took
Get a girl, a wife, or a playboy book

Sittin' at a red light
Tryin' to get my head right
This girl pass with a monster-ass
Mentally distracted
I mannishly reacted
My penis expanded
Her number I demanded
The questions I asked her were nice and discrete
But now she's in my passenger seat
Turn on the beat
Went to my castle
Fucked without a hassle
Oh it felt great, in her asshole
She was sexy, seductive, her name was Morgan
I loved the way she sucked my reproductive organ
I road it and road it
Finally unloaded (uhh)
Went to the bathroom because I couldn't hold it
Oh I looked down and I was trippin'
Because I seen blood drippin'
Off the tip of my penis
It don't take a genius to figure she's a virgin
Scrubbed my dick with detergent
I'm in the mix, if you know what I mean
Cuz the girl's only sixteen
Your nipples are hard
Your booty is soft
But cutie, I need to drop you off, pass my keys
Smashin' down the street
Tryin' to get rid of the broad
But her mama standing in the front yard
Lookin' at me weird cuz I'm gangsta geared
I look kinda old with a fro and a beard
She looked at me as if I was Satan
I smashed off on my hundred spoke daytons
Turned the shit up had the bass go whoppin'
Stressin' like a mothafucker goin' back to Compton
Turned down the street and I was skatin' homie
Sheriff department straight waitin' on me
We just need to ask a few questions homie
Why the fuck you putting these handcuffs on me?
Got to the station, now they tellin' me
That shit I did was a felony
Maybe you can release your rap tape
When you through doing time for statutory rape

Met this girl named Kim working at M&M
She was nice and slim
She got a man but she don't talk to him
You know, let her tell it
Sniff that pussy you can probably smell it
Anyway she got a baby, of course, of course
Her and her man is goin' through a divorce
We kept talkin' so good so far
We started walkin' back to my car
Fired up the engine went to my house
Pulled down my pants, started cheatin' on my spouse
With a slow tempo I fucked the broad
But she's a nympho, bitch like it fast and hard
Oh my god this girl is odd
Lost my vision as I shot my wad
Put on my pants, cocked up my gat
I gotta get rid of this hood rat
Cuz she's callin' other men on my telephone
It's time for this bitch to take her ass home
After ejaculation, took the bitch home with no conversation
No more Luther or S. Gate
I pulled out my all-white too short tape
I'm playin' dopamine beat, and the shit still hit
I'ma make the bitch walk if she talk some shit
Got to her house, banked on the curb
Threw my head back, fired up some herb
She asked me do you wanna come in?
I said wait a minute woman
Who do you live with?
She said I'm single I don't play that shit
I don't lie, I tell every guy
You gotta call me first before you come by
I said alright
Put my car in park
Then I walked inside
I hit the alarm on my '83 caddy
She was yippin' and yappin'
About her baby daddy
Talkin' with a hoochie pitch
She called her baby daddy a lil ol' bitch
Talkin' shit loud and fast
Bitch talkin' bout she kicked his ass
Said she socked him, like a lil ol' hoe
But we was disturbed by a knock on the door
Damn, who is that? where's my gat?
I hope I don't die fuckin' with this hood rat
I'm tryin' to be one of those Palmdale playas
But now I'm caught in some chaos
But now I'm caught in some chaos
But now I'm caught-
Hey anyway man
The TV and the radio was playin'
I couldn't quite figure out what they was sayin'
They voices started escalatin'
And I'm sittin' on the couch debatin'
Should I stay? should I leave?
Should I grab the bitch by her fuckin' weave?
Sock her in the eye, bitch don't lie
You knew your baby daddy was fixin' to come by
And you invited me in
Now look at the shape I'm in
My palms are sweaty
My muscles was tense
I stood up fool I couldn't take the suspense
I walked to the door kinda nervous
I'm not ready for a funeral service
Opened up the door, calm and cool
I got eye contact with the fool
She talked about him as if he was small
Come to find out he like seven feet tall
I spoke, he spoke
He gave me a pound with his hand
I walked right past the man
Jumped in my '83 Cadillac
Drove down the street then I never came back
Went to the house, grabbed the mic and started rappin'
About the scandalous shit that coulda happen
