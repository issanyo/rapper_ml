(Intro)
Hahahaha, yeah
Just move from side to side
C'mon y'all

(Hook)
I can't sleep at night
Cause the couple next door just fuss and fight
But when the night's over and it's daylight
They hug and kiss and everything's alright
Head, shoulders, feet, and toes
Scratched up knee caps and elbows
Every night, they duckin blows
But they still together and that's how it goes

(Verse 1)
This is a story of Jack and Jill
No, not the ones who went up the hill
I mean a couple lovers that live next door
They always fightin, and I keep the score
They be pettin and pokin
Jabbin and jokin
Coo'in and crackin
Moo'in and whackin
Neckin and knockin
Sangin and sockin
Squakin and squeezin
Burnin and freezin
He holds her hand, long as he able
But when he lets her go, she bops him with a table
Pattin and pinchin
Cloutin and clenchin
Havin theyself a good tiiime

(Hook)
I can't sleep at night
Cause the couple next door just fuss and fight
But when the night's over and it's daylight
They hug and kiss and everything's alright
Head, shoulders, feet, and toes
Scratched up knee caps and elbows
Every night, they duckin blows
But they still together and that's how it goes

(Verse 2)
Reverend Green thought he called one day
On this nice newly-wed across the way
But just as the pastor knocked on the door
A right connected and he hit the floor
They was pettin and poppin
Bangin and boppin
Coo'in and kissin
Hittin and missin
Groovin and grievin
Lovin and leavin
Kickin and cacklin
Ticklin and tacklin
My other neighbor tried to intervention
But one jab knocked out his good intentions
They was stewin and stabbin
Jivin and jabbin
Havin theyself a good tiiime

(Hook)
I can't sleep at night
Cause the couple next door just fuss and fight
But when the nights over and it's daylight
They hug and kiss and everything's alright
Head, shoulders, feet, and toes
Scratched up knee caps and elbows
Every night, they duckin blows
But they still together and that's how it goes

(Verse 3)
A lion escaped from a circus train
Strayed in Jack and Jills domain
They got in a towering rage
The lion took a look and jumped back in the cage
They was swattin and swayin
Plottin and playin
Stompin and stabbin
Groovin and grabbin
Dancin and duckin
Trippin and truckin
Plottin and pleadin
Bangin and bleedin
Her mama said "I'll go fetch her!"
But mama came out ridin on a stretcher
They was hittin and holdin
Faintin and foldin
Havin theyself a good tiiime

(Hook)
I can't sleep at night
Cause the couple next door just fuss and fight
But when the night's over and it's daylight
They hug and kiss and everything's alright
Head, shoulders, feet, and toes
Scratched up knee caps and elbows
Every night, they duckin blows
But they still together and that's how it goes

(Verse 4)
One day a reporter interviewed the wife
Try'na get some data on her hectic life
She said that she never had time for books
She was too busy, duckin left hooks
Swattin and swingin
Sockin and singin
Cuttin and cuddlin
Messin and muddin
Fondle and fussin
Kissin and cussin
Tippin and teasin
Squattin and squeezin
The cop said "Stop! I'm the law!"
Too bad he couldn't stop that right to the jaw
They was jivin and jumpin
Thrivin and thumpin
Havin theyself a good tiiime

(Hook)
I can't sleep at night
Cause the couple next door just fuss and fight
But when the nights over and it's daylight
They hug and kiss and everything's alright
Head, shoulders, feet, and toes
Scratched up knee caps and elbows
Every night, they duckin blows
But they still together and that's how it goes
That's how it goes
