I wish you would roll a new blunt
I wish you would roll a new blunt
I wish you would roll a new blunt
And pass me a beer
Good weed I bring like a cottonmouth king
So reach in the cooler and pass me a beer
I wish you would roll a new blunt
I wish you would roll a new blunt
I wish you would roll a new blunt
And pass me a beer
Good weed I bring like a cottonmouth king
So reach in the cooler and pass me a beer
I wish you would roll a new blunt
I wish you would roll a new blunt
I wish you would roll a new blunt
And pass me a beer
Good weed I bring like a cottonmouth king
So reach in the cooler and pass me a beer
I wish you would roll a new blunt
I wish you would roll a new blunt
I wish you would roll a new blunt
And pass me a beer
Good weed I bring like a cottonmouth king
Good weed for Christmas, so pass me a beer
