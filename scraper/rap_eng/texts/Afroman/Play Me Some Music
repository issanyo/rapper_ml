Play me some music
When my money lows
And I don't have no where to go
Play me some music in the ghetto
Whatever problems I have
I'm going to just let go
Play me some music
When Ire arise's
Thank you lord for opeing my eyes
Play me some music
While I take my bath make
Me sing make me laugh
Play me some music while I cook my food
Keep me dancing in a real good mood
Play me some music while I iron my clothes
I can't let down all the fine ass hoes
Play me some music while I was my car
Ride around like a movie star
Play me some music while I make my cash
Selling weed beer and hash
Play me some music while I pimp my hoes
Ride around ?????????????
Play me some music music
Music music music


Play me some music
Play me some music through a hurricane
Give me shelter from the rain
Play me some music when a family member dies
And all I can do is hug and crie
Play me some music when my woman leaves
And all I have is memories
Play me some music when I can't laugh
And IRS takes all I have
When you play me some music for all the illegal stops and eveyone that gets robbed by the cops play me some music while I drink my beers wipe my tears and spread my cheers
Play some music music
Music play me some music music
