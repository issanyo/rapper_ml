Yeah, we survivin
Oh God, it's so hard
Oh God, it's so hard

Don't you hate when society trouble you
Fuck up your TRW
When your lights get cut off
Gas get shut off
Plus you at work, workin yo butt off
You come home, pick up the phone
Don't hear the dial tone, something's wrong
Your girl come home hair done money spent
But baby, where's your half of the rent?
She start makin promises
But you already know how broke she is
You do the budget and you wanna kick her ass dude
Spent too much money on fast food
Now ya smoke that doja
House bout to go in foreclosure
Got so many bills in the mail box
It make you wanna dip sticks plus sell rocks
Late notice, final notice
You owe that, you owe this
You get pissed and start drinking cause you're tired of the drama
Wish you was at home, livin with your mamma
But you can't, you're full grown
And you gotta survive on ya own
Sometimes I wanna put the gat to my face (Why?)
Cause life is a rat race, when you out here

Don't you hate when you go on an interview
And society likes what they see in you
You get so excited cause you got hired
Later on that day, you got fired
Even though you a thug tryin to do yo best
You still didn't pass yo drug test
Now you sittin at the house unemployed
Lookin at the bills gettin paranoid
So you grab your keys, get in your car
Hit the welfare office for some quick GR
Can you make it on food stamps? (Nope)
Now you need to sell a little (Dope)
If you made fast money that'd be on hip
But look at the people that you're dealin with
Gangbangers, cluckheads, backstabbers, cutthroats
You bought a quarter piece but the shit look short
It's bad enough a brother gotta sell crack
Break it down and you barely make your profit back
Sell ya nickles for dimes and ya dimes for dubs
But the baseheads don't show no damn love
Cause the es√©s slangin rocks down two doors
And they got rocks way bigger than yours
So what the hell is you talkin bout?
You give a price and the baseheads walkin out
Every night you argue with your spouse
Cause she don't want the cops to raid the house
You can't make love to the girl no more
Cause all night you got people bangin on the door
(Afro) Yo dreams you not achievin
Yo baby mamma talkin bout she leaving
You thought she was playin but she packed and left
You thinkin bout smokin that crack yaself

Ain't no laws, ain't no rules
When you dealin with a buncha fools
Ain't no laws, ain't no rules
When you dealin with a buncha fools
Ain't no laws, ain't no rules
When you dealin with a buncha fools
Ain't no laws, ain't no rules

Oh God, it's so hard

It seems like my bills won't cease (Won't cease)
I need to get a quick quarter piece (Quarter piece)
Forget a quarter piece I need a zone (Need a zone)
I really need to get my dollar bills on (Get em on)
Man forget a damn zone I need a bird (Need a bird)
My food stamps don't come unitl the 3rd (Ya heard?)
Man forget about a bird I need a truck (Need a truck)
Go to Mexico cause I don't give a buckabuckaaaa
Forget a damn truck I need a gat (Need a gat)
So I can find where the ballers at (What?)
I need ta hit a hit a hit a lid (Get a lid)
I need a whole lotta money real quick
Oh God, it's so hard
Oh God, it's so hard
Baby

I said A is for apple, B is for blunt
This bitch ain't got no teeth in the front
She couldn't dance with me a minute ago
With them Payless specials on
That ain't no French roll bitch that's just a roll
That ain't no perm that's a temporary
Nigga still need to cut that shit out grow yo natural
Make a rap tape like me
Bitch need to be the Afrowoman
Or some God damn body while you bullshittin
I'm just playin can I get yo number?
