I awake and it is morning
I breathe and it is wind
I stand up and it is sunrise
I wander and it is clouds moving
I drink and it is rivers flowing
I walk and it is horses racing
I roar and it is thunder
I jump and it is spring
I open my eyes and it is summer
I lay down and it is fall
I kiss the earth and it is winter
