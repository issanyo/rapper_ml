Death to the world! Cthulhu's come:
Let Earth abhor this thing
Let every mind prepare for doom
As anguish and woe he'll bring
As anguish and woe he'll bring
As anguish and woe he'll bring

Up from the sea, R'lyeh did rise:
The cultists awestruck dumb
With ancient rites so wretched and perverse
Cthulhu's time has come
Cthulhu's time has come
Cthulhu's time has come

Death to the world! Cthulhu reigns
The Great Old Ones Destroy

With wrath and doom, so cruel and foul
Replete with obscene joy
Replete with obscene joy
Replete with obscene joy

He rules the Earth with dreadful might
And through our ghastly dreams
His twisting turning tentacles
Elicit from us maddened screams
Cthulhu's time has come
Cthulhu's time has come
Cthulhu's time has come
