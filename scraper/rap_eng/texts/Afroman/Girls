A man I wrote this rap about Little Red Riding Hood
When I was a little kid, check it out man

I met lil red riding hood
We took a ride to my hood
And I rode her real good
Like Martin Luther King
I have a dream to make red riding hood holler and scream
I said boom bang pop pow
Grandmamma can't help ya now
When you're on all fours like a horse on her hoof
I'm Afroman the big bad woof

I like the girls (you know why? cause I'm a locsta
Locsta hundred spokesta)

Girls
They gotta be
The most precious commodity
My brain's like the ocean but nothing is swimming
Through my head except naked women
Of course I wanna have sex with you
Do I look like I'm a homosexual
All you feminists hate my guts
But girl you gonna love these nuts

Girls (yeah we gonna break it down you understand me)
I like the girls (all my g-mosobies up there in
Pimp-dale Pimp-afornia)
Girls (I'm smokin tumbleweed with all my homies from
Haddeys-herb Missi-hempie)
I like the girls (a man check out this song we used to
Sing when we was little kids right)

My girl got two big lips
Taste like potato chips
My girl got two big boobs
Just like two intertubes
My girl got two big hips
Just like two battleships
My girl got real long hair
Down to her underwear
My girl gotta slender waste
Her favorite seat is on my face
I got taste
I got taste
