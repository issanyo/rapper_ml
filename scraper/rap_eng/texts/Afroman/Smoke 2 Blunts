(Intro)
Yeah, how you doin?
Haha, right

No seeds, just crumble it wit'cha fist
Aww yeah, fresh blunts man
I love it when they split down the middle like a brand new fresh baked brownie.. just ugh
I know they don't smoke weed in town though
The blunts be crackin like fall leaves n shit, know what I'm sayin?

(Hook)
I smoke two blunts in the morning
I smoke two blunts at night (Smoke two blunts at night)
I smoke two blunts in the afternoon
It makes me feel alright (Makes me feel alright)
I smoke two blunts in the time of peace
I smoke two in the time of war (Two in the time of waaar)
I smoke two blunts before I smoke two blunts
And then I smoke two more (Then I smoke two moooore)

Gotta stay calm (Calm) gotta stay cool (Cool)
Can't blow up and act a fool
Wisdom, reason, login, sense
Gotta be relaxed, not tense
I can't overreact (Overreact)
Cause It's over if the wrong person overreact, back (BLat!)
One puff, one day at a time (Day at a time)
One forty ounce, one big fat dime (Big fat dime)
One nation, under a groove (Under a groove)
