(feat. E-40)

If god had long hair, and a go-t
And if his eyes were pretty glazed
And he looked spaced out would you buy his story
Would you believe he had an eye infection?

(Course)
And yeah, yeah, god looks baked
And yeah, yeah, god smells good
And yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
What is god smoked cannabis?
Hit the bong like some of us
Drove a tie-die microbus, and he subscribes to rolling stones

If god made this place in the begging and did he grow any seeds 
Or did he put them there for Adam and Eve
So they'd be hungry for the apple that the snake was always offering

(course)
And yeah yeah god rolls great
And yeah yeah god smells good
And yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
What if god smoked cannabis?
Do you suppose he had a buzz?
When he made the platypus
He made it earth our home
Does he like Perljam or the stones?
And do you think he rolls his own
Up there in heaven on the throne?
And when the saints go marching home
Maybe he sits and smokes a bone
