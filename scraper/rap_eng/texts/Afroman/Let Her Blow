Fellas don't go psycho
When she's on her menstrual cycle
If you can't fuck the hoe
Let her blow, let her blow, let her blow

Maxi pads are frightful
But orgasms are delightful
If you can't fuck the hoe
Let her blow, let her blow, let her blow

After she blows my wad I hate to go out in the storm
But when I think about what she just did my hard on keeps me warm

If that pussy ain't popping
Get her head to bopping
If you can't fuck the hoe
Let her blow, let her blow, let her blow

I wonder if Miss Morgan
Will suck my reproductive organ
If her cycle has to flow
Let her blow, let her blow, let her blow

Well it feels so good I'm crying
Everywhere sperm is flying
If you can't fuck the hoe
Let her blow...

After she blows my wad I hate to go out in the storm
But when I think about what she just did my hard on keeps me warm

If you can't stick it
Kick back and let her lick it
If you can't fuck the hoe
Let her blow, let her blow, let her blow

If there is no pussy pounding
You might find her lips astounding
If you can't fuck the hoe
Let her blow, let her blow, let her blow

I accept trainees
Get down on your knees!
If you can't fuck the hoe
Let her blow, let her blow, let her blow

After she blows my wad I hate to go out in the storm
But when I think about what she just did my hard on keeps me warm

Fellas don't get mad
Let her change her maxi pad
If you got her head down low
Let her blow, let her blow, let her blow

And when she gets real grumpy
Give her something lumpy
Since you can't fuck the hoe
Let her blow.... let her blow....
