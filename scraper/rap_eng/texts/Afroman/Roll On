[Intro Dialogue]

[Chorus: Afroman + (E-40)]
Roll on
Roll on
(Why is it taking so hella long to come in?)
Don’t let nobody put you down
You roll on
Roll on
Roll on
Don’t let nobody put you down
(Don’t let nobody put you down, pimp)
You roll on

[Afroman]
Ay, let me tell you about who I am, man
A-F-R-O-M-A-N
Sell more dope than Ronald Reagan
Spit rap songs like Copenhagen
I bet you wanna spin the disc again

[E-40]
I never caught a break ‘cause I was always broke
I never ate a steak until I almost choked
I never baked a cake unless it was some dope
I was always the opposite of soap

[Afroman]
Tried to make a mil without a record deal
Selling tapes out the back of my Coupe de Ville
My pocketrs was skinny, I had to fatten ‘em
I went what I call “parking lot platinum”

[E-40]
The new old school, the Tower of Power
I taught the whole world how to pop their collar
They call Big Earl, Stevens that is
Much love to little Darryl and all my folks in the feds

[Chorus: Afroman + (E-40)]
Roll on
Roll on
Don’t let nobody put you down
You roll on
Roll on
Roll on
Don’t let nobody put you down
You roll on

[Afroman]
I used to buy quarters, couldn’t fuck with an ounce
Now I write checks and watch the bank bounce
Work for the corporate world, no, never
Afroman’s so paid forever

[B-Legit]
Got stars on my team, we roll phenomenal
I’m far from the scene but control the domino
At the bar sippin’ Heem, my stroll Geronimo
Crack like that, black stack phenomenal

[E-40]
Man, I’m tired of grindin’, I want out of this life
My thoughts be rhymin’, they done asked a playa twice
They thought I was lyin’, jappin’ and jousin’
‘Til I bought them little niggas an MPC-2000

[B-Legit]
I bounce to the hizzle ‘cause the run was made
36 kicks, ice escapades
26 zips, got the best in naid
Two to six clips, bet your chest get sprayed

[Chorus: Afroman + (E-40)]
Roll on
Roll on
Ay, 40 I wanna hear you singin’ this shit too, mayne (OK)
Don’t let nobody put you down
You roll on
I want you to sing this shit too—everybody, where y’all at?

[Afroman]
Some people see me and see negativity
Some people look at me and see positivity
But when I see myself, I see creativity
God created me and I create money
Jah man, put your hands up if you out here getting paid
Jah man, put your hands up if you out here getting laid
You using two condoms and you ain’t catching AIDS
We been making rap tapes since the 8th grade, yeah

[E-40]
Girls and sex, I love it to death
I can’t get enough, I’m holding my breath
I’m diving up in, I’m swimming to shore
I’m bringing her in, with me on a tour

[Afroman + (E-40)]
Throw your head back back back back
Lean it to the side (Lean it to the side)
We used to be local (we used to be local)
Now we worldwide (now we worldwide)
Throw your head back back back back
Lean it to the side (Lean it to the side)
We used to be local (we used to be local)
Now we worldwide (now we worldwide)
Throw your head back back back back
Lean it to the side (Lean it to the side)
We used to be local (we used to be local)
Now we worldwide (now we worldwide)
Throw your head back back back back
Lean it to the side (Lean it to the side)
We used to be local (we used to be local)
Now we worldwide (But now we worldwide)
Throw your head back back back back…
Lean it to the side
Now we worldwide (It’s all gravity, BIATCH!)
