Paddy-wag, paddy wagon afroman
Ruff 'em up cuff 'em up, lock 'em in the can
Mess up his records so he can't get a job
Maybe he'll have to kill, steal and rob
Can he survive, yes he can, he the hungry hustler afroman
Ain't got no job, ain't got no credit
But whatever ya need, baby he'll go get it
Cut my hair is what y'all said
But I couldn't get a job with a bald head
First I get fired, last to get hired
I work for myself, Now i'm retired
Damn, take bravery
To escape modern day slavery
Jam, you ever seen the place
Kinda look like [..]

I'ma quit my job, go home check on my girl
Fuck tha corporate world

Fuck tha corporate world
Hop in the cadillac, let the daytoners twirl
Fuck tha corporate word

2003, [...]
Gold daytoners on a rolls-royce bentley

Run the pencilnecks out the pool
Sag my khakis, show my ass
To the pencilneck-geeks sittin' in first class
Blonde bimbo, stretch limo
House next-do, to rush limbaugh
Standin on the curb, smokin' herb
Subwoofer subbin' all through the suburb
Underground baby, fuck the masses
Internet cellphone [..]
Sexy freak, everyday of the week
No [..] from a pencilneck-geek
Stop kissing ass, work for yourself
Fuck slavery! increase your wealth

Quit yo job, go home check on your girl
Fuck tha corporate world
Smoke marihuana, drink malt liquor till you earl
Fuck tha corporate world
Hop in the cadillac, let the daytoners twirl
Fuck tha corporate word
If tha cops [..]
Fuck tha corporate world
