Chorus:
As, I hit the bong
I wonder, what went wrong
With my mainstream hip hop fans
As, I toke along reminiscing weed we smoked on all day, and all night long

I'm the rap star Afroman, off the charts and I feel the pain
Wishing I wouldn't rack my brain, 2 Chain and Little Wayne
I wonder, wo.wo.wo.wo.wonder
Why, is it because I got high you don't think I'm fly
Call me one hit wonder, curse me to the day I die
One hit wonder, I hit the blunt and just wonder

Verse: 1
How can I be just a one hit Wonder
83 albums, hitting like thunder
You think 1 hit is all I got
But I play 90 minutes on a 3 hour slot
1 hit that's 1 song, the average song 4 minutes 20 seconds long
Explain how I entertain for hours, drunk and hot, supernatural powers
Afro fans would act a foo, If I don't sing hits like "Back to School"
I get complaints from my fans, If I don't sing hits like Tall Cans
Afroman you suck, if you don't sing "She Won't Let Me Fuck"
I might have to fight, If I don't sing "Lets Get Drunk Tonight"
I can't leave alive if I don't sing "Colt 45"
Colt 45 and two zig zags, baby that's all we need

Chorus:
As, I hit the bong
I wonder, what went wrong
With my mainstream hip hop fans
As, I toke along reminiscing weed we smoked on all day, and all night long

I'm the rap star Afroman, off the charts and I feel the pain
Wishing I wouldn't rack my brain, 2 Chain, and Little Wayne
I wonder, wo.wo.wo.wo.wonder
Why, is it because I got high you don't think I'm fly
Call me one hit wonder, curse me to the day I die
One hit wonder, I hit the blunt and just wonder

Verse: 2
Afro, Afroman, sing "I Live in a Van"
Come on don't be no wussy
We wanna here "In Your Pussy"
Afroman, I'm bomb as hell, I wrote songs like "Palmdale"
Leave the stage they yelling no
They wanna here hits like "Sell Your Dope"
Hush, the crowds callin my name
Hits like "Hush" bring me fame
How can I be just a one hit wonder
I hit the blunt just wonder

Chorus:
As, I hit the bong
I wonder, what went wrong
With my mainstream hip hop fans
As, I toke along reminiscing weed we smoked on all day, and all night long

I'm the rap star Afroman, off the charts and I feel the pain
Wishing I wouldn't rack my brain, 2 Chain, and Little Wayne
I wonder, wo.wo.wo.wo.wonder
Why, is it because I got high you don't think I'm fine
Call me one hit wonder, curse me to the day I die
One hit wonder, I hit the blunt and just wonder

Verse: 3
Encore, yes indeed they like my hit song "Tumbleweed"
I made another hit for yah, "Just My Paranoia"
Your party is live, but my party is live(er)
When I say "Colt 45", the gangster, the frat boy and the Hippie
Wanna here that hit song "Mississippi"
Pass me the spliff, I wrote a hit song "Graveyard Shift"
Everywhere I go people make a fuss, I wrote "Back on the Bus"
They pay me green baby, know what I mean baby
I wrote that hit song I'm a "Dope Fiend" baby
How can I be just a one hit wonder
I hit the blunt just wonder

Chours:
As, I hit the bong
I wonder, what went wrong
With my mainstream hip hop fans
As, I toke along reminiscing weed we smoked on all day, and all night long

I'm the rap star Afroman, off the charts and I feel the pain
Wishing I wouldn't rack my brain, 2 Chain, and Lil Wayne
I wonder, wo.wo.wo.wo.wonder
Why, is it because I got high you don't think I'm fly
Call me one hit wonder, curse me to the day I die
One hit wonder, I hit the blunt and just wonder
