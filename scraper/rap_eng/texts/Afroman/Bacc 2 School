[Intro: Afroman]

Man, my daddy told me
Boy, when I was your age
I had to walk 13 miles to school
I said, "Oh, is that why you didn't graduate?"

[Hook: Afroman]

Talkin' noise with all of my homeboys
Fit to go back to school, yeah
(Her titties bigger than they were last summer, know what I'm sayin'?)
With a mouthful of beer and a nose full of weed
You know I'm fit to act a fool, yeah

[Verse 2: Afroman]

Mama, I'mma
Go to the University of Smoking Marijuana
All of my friends go to USC
So I'm gonna tag along and hit the bong with them
Walkin' through the masses, lookin' for my classes
I can't concentrate on the teacher, surrounded by titties and asses
Spent a lot of money on some brand new clothes
Trying to impress these brand new hoes
Laugh every time I have sex with a chick
Baby don't know I'm an ex-convict
Walking round the campus with my 'fro on thick
Every twenty seconds I be grabbin' my dick
Full of alcohol at the football games
Doin' more drugs than my nigga Rick James
My GPA is dropping at a very fast rate
It'll take a miracle for me to graduate
Maybe I won't, maybe I will
Stressed out, poppin' pills in my Coupe Deville

[Hook x1]

[Verse 2: Afroman]

How do I party?
And still pass
I hardly
Ever go to class
Got a golden eagle on my stolen Regal
If you bought it from me, it's illegal
Cause I'm Afroman, the educated Crip
On a rock cocaine scholarship
Cook that crack until it's done
I use that for my Negro college fund

Broke minorities, selling dope to those bitches in sororities
She's drinking one too many 40's
She took her clothes off, now we're having orgies
Baby, I don't mean to act rude
But you told me you would never fuck a black dude
Colt 45 must have got you in the mood
To eat a fat dick like some soul food

[Hook x1]

[Verse 3: Afroman]

(Hey fellas, can I get jiggy with it? Hey, check this shit out right here)

Hey homeboy, don't stress, I got the answers to the test
My college professor smokes a lot of grass
She's gonna make sure we pass
That's how you pass trigonometry
Sell dope to your teacher, use nigga-nometry
On the microphone, there's not a rapper bomb as me
And under police pressure, nobody's as calm as me
Wait a minute, you know what's fucked up
Black people in college act stuck up
So self-conscious, and insecure
You wanna speak black, but you really ain't sure
Look at me, what do you see?
You see the OG, you ashamed to be
So fuck you, you pretty little rich frat boy
You can suck my dick just like that boy

[Hook x1]

[Verse 4: Afroman]

I said, "Honey
You got some sexy looks
You need money
To buy your textbooks"
Get it wet, and I can get it hard
We can slide your vaginal credit card
Computer girl, come to my house and be my tutor girl
Before we study, can we smoke a little Buddha, girl?
Raise your shirt, lick the nipples on your hooters, girl
Open up your legs, baby you the girl
Stick out your tongue and let me shoot it, girl
You was playing with my floppy, then my hard drive downloaded
Down your throat, and fucking exploded
Tell your prejudice dad and mom
To email their comments to suck-my-dick.com
Afro's the bomb, blowing up like Vietnam

[Hook x2]
