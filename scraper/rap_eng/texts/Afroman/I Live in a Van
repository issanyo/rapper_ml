[Verse 1]
Woke up this morning at the hotel
Rolled up a blunt got high as hell
Fucked another groupie name in my cell
Hell, oh well, it's time to bail
Walking to the van with my suitcase
Driving cross country to a new place
Exit 420 get something to eat
Greet who I meet
Smoke a sweet
Climb back on to the interstate
Yes got a date, can't be late
Pulled up to the club get a sound check
Walk up to the bar get a longneck
Shooting some pool, act real cool
Look at her ass but please don't drool
I look at my watch, start thinking
Yeah it's time for me to start drinking

[Hook x2]
My name is Afroman
I live in the back of a Chevrolet van
Everynight I'm somewhere new
Smoking weed, drinking brew

[Verse 2]
Dressing room, [?]
I get fucked up before the show
Ride to the club smoking a dub
Hopping out the van with the woofers on sub
It's time to go on
I'm drunk I'm high come on
How's everybody doing?
Which of you ladies feel like screwing?
Women on stage
Security in rage
Guitar solo
Colt 45 kickin' in, oh no
Uh oh I'm playing it right
What? shit sound tight
Encore
We want more
Yeah, break that shit down

[Hook x2]
My name is Afroman
I live in the back of a Chevrolet van
Everynight I'm somewhere new
Smoking weed, drinking brew

[Verse 3]
Shake the hand of the fan
Introduce to the band
Sign autographs, take pictures
Try to be polite to these fake bitches
One of these bitches just might
Kick it with an internet rapper tonight
Best case scenario
We get high and fuck very slow
Pass out with her ass out
So I can rub it, man I love it
Early in the morning yes, yes I know
Hug my neck kiss my cheek, yes she gots to go
I do too, I do too
Smoke some more weed
Drink some more brew
I love my life
Peace
No stress to strife

[Hook x3]
My name is Afroman
I live in the back of a Chevrolet van
Everynight I'm somewhere new
Smoking weed, drinking brew
