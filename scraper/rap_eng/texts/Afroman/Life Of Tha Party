[Chorus]
I'm tha only drunk (uh uh)
Dancin to tha funk (uh uh)

To get this thing crunk
I'm tha life of tha party (uh uh)
Sippin on bacardi

Sippin on bacardi

[verse 1]
Eerybody seem up tight, I'm drunk so everythings allright
Got a light? -yeah- right right
Kick back take a hit(take a hit) turn it up bump that shit(bump it)
I'm dancin I'm groovin other people look at me and start movin
Everybody getting comfortable starting throwin up nice and full
Start dancin wild motherf**kers smile next thing you know
They dincin too smoking weed drinking brew callin people up on their
Cellphone east palmdale homeboy its on

[Chorus]
I'm tha only drunk (uh uh)
Dancin to tha funk (uh uh)
I guess it's up to me (uh uh)
To get this thing crunk
I'm tha life of tha party (uh uh)
Sippin on bacardi
I'm tha life of tha party (uh uh)
Sippin on bacardi

[verse 2]
I'm tha only drunk dancin to tha funk I guess it's up te me to
Get this thing crunk get high get drunk go bizarr standin up
Straight is major work drivin home I really hope it
I can keep my eyelids open hope that exotic dancer answer
Roll cross country lost with the munchie looking for a country
Girl that will hunt me palmdale came back to me got down on her knees

And blew me jumped up on my dick screaming man i love what she do to me

[Chorus]
I'm tha only drunk (uh uh)
Dancin to tha funk (uh uh)
I guess it's up to me (uh uh)
To get this thing crunk
I'm tha life of tha party (uh uh)
Sippin on bacardi
I'm tha life of tha party (uh uh)
Sippin on bacardi

[verse 3]
Standin in the yard bumpin sounds
See my homeboy in black and shout you blocking traffic back up and
Park you know I got a big fat blunt to spark other homeboys start
Cruisin by tryin to get drunk tryin to get high sidewalk looks like
A gangstameeting khaki sack it system beating next thing you know
I see a cop he's writing numbers down he don't stop wafle house late
At night drunkers are gone highers ar kait f**k with the waitress but
Don't be rude bitch might spit all in my food (hey play that music
Innocent folks won't refuse it) but it in the studio then abuse it
Say you got high gentleman excuse it get drunk sag your pants if you
All alone do your dance

[Chorus]
I'm tha only drunk (uh uh)
Dancin to tha funk (uh uh)
I guess it's up to me (uh uh)
To get this thing crunk
I'm tha life of tha party (uh uh)
Sippin on bacardi
I'm tha life of tha party (uh uh)
Sippin on bacardi
