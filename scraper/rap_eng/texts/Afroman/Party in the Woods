[Intro: Chad Mac]
Here's a little story that must be told
About a good ol'boy that got put on hold
They tried to hold me back from fortune and fame
But real country boys stay true to the game

[Verse 1: Chad Mac]
Yeah, Chad Mac in the place
And this is for the jacked up trucks with the bass
And the mud grip tires
They tried to stomp me out but I'm hotter than a bonfire
Every time I drink 190 proof
My deer blind turns into a DJ Booth
This is how we party in the woods
So call up your folks and tell 'em it's all good

[Chorus]
Turn up the radio we got the beer iced down
The moon is shining so pass it around
Tell ya friends and ya family that its all good
'Cause this is how we do it when we party in the woods

[Verse 2: Afroman]
Afroman growing weed like a hippie
Party in the woods when I'm in Mississippi
I told Chad Mac my Cadillac might get stuck
Pick me up in the truck
He came from the back woods to my back hood
(I got my pedal to the metal and the 4 Wheels drive its all good)
Listen to the mutters water splashing out the gutters

[Chorus]
Turn up the radio we got the beer iced down
The moon is shining so pass it around
Tell ya friends and ya family that its all good
'Cause this is how we do it when we party in the woods

[Verse 3: Chad Mac]
This is how we do it in the sticks
Just some good ol' boys on that down south shit
If your country than you feel it
We party in the woods cause we all bout that real tree
Mudzillas on my shit cause they bite well
High beams cutting trails like a white tail
This how we partying so call up your folks and tell 'em it's all good

[Chorus]
Turn up the radio we got the beer iced down
The moon is shining so pass it around
Tell ya friends and ya family that its all good
'Cause this is how we do it when we party in the woods

[Verse 4: Afroman]
I was born in LA raised (Palmdale) from the west coast where my rap tapes really don't sell
"Well," I went down south with a colt 45 and a blunt in my mouth
After sippin' Bacardi started spittin' up the stupid all brickless part My grass roots stands from the woods of old grow
Help me take the shit off the stove

[Chorus]
Turn up the radio we got the beer iced down
The moon is shining so pass it around
Tell ya friends and ya family that its all good
'Cause this is how we do it when we party in the woods
