You're nothing but a problem that i've already solved
You got me twisted

So go ahead and shut up
Pour some Colt 45 in my cup
Oops, i bet you didn't know
We don't tolerate bitches like you, hoe
You little stupid bitch
Thinkin' you're the only person rich
Drop on down to your knees
Hurry up and get these N-U-T-S
