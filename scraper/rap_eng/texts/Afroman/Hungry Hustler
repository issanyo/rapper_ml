I quit my job this mornin'
I don't want to work no more
Fuck MacDonald's and Taco Bell
That modern day slavery is knockin on my front door
(I don't fit in the corporate world man)
Get you a big fat sack o' yayo
Can't see my kids can't see my wife
Can't see a way to control my dog-on life
Hungryyyy hustlas

(Afroman)
Got hired at the dope spot
I'm an employee
Cookin' crack like a black Chef Boyardee
Got Meth, speed, whatever you need
Zigzags come free wit a bag of weed
If You want some sure, go talk to her
The skinny black dude wit the real long perm
Laptop computers, rap CDs, Motorola phones, Sony color TVs
Got the porno tapes in the back of the car, get it free when you buy a hot VCR
Got gats and D's, car batteries
Getting money with my folks on a hundred spokes
Cops ain't waiters, we don't tip em
Treat cars like women take em home and strip em
Match the pink slips, get the smog inspection
Put a add in the paper in the classified section
Cause' I don't want to work no more
(Fuck that shit)
Modern day slavery knocking on my front door
(Fuck that shit)
Can't see my kids can't see my wife
Can't see a way to control my own life
Cause I don't want to work no more
Modern day slavery knockin on my front door
Can't see my kids can't see my wife
Can't see a way to control my damn life, motherfucker

(Melody)
I quit my job this morning'
I don't want to work no more
Fuck MacDonald's and Taco Bell
Modern day slavery is knocking on my front door
Get you a big fat sack of yayo
Can't see my kids can't see my wife
Can't see a way to control my dog-on life
Tell the Neighborhood watch, tell the Neighborhood listen
Tell the neighborhood ya big screen television missin'
New in my hood, I got to come to ya
Steal ya car battery and sell it back to ya
Then I come back, just for kicks
I leave ya car sitin' on four big bricks
All I need now is some vascus homes
Cause my garage looks just like auto zone
What you say man? Ya need another beeper?
Buy from me, cause it's a whole lot cheaper
Got a cellular phone, and ya really oughta get it
Fo a limited time, brother, the chip come wit it
So come to my house, when the times is hard
It's just like Vegas in my back yard
I keep my Afro pick, my khakis creased
And my next-door neighbors callin up the police
Cause' I don't want to work no more
Modern day slavery knockin on my front door
Can't see my kids can't see my wife
Can't see a way to control my own life
I said cause' I don't want to work no more
Modern day slavery knockin on my front door
Can't see my kids can't see my wife
Can't see a way to control my damn life

(Melody)

Rough, reckless, snatch yo necklace
Sell it on the corner and buy myself breakfast
I made in an hour or more
So what the fuck do I want to get job for?
So the yuppies the guppies, can floss their power
My black ass five dollas an hour
And the fact is, after taxes, got to live
Where the Mexicans and the blacks is mother fucker
Crooked police, gangs in chuck tailors
Bums sleeping in fuckin trucks and trailers
Three hundred dollors every two weeks
From the stupid, tired, penny pinching pencil neck geeks
Abraham Lincoln told me I was free
So ima walk to corner and do what I want to
While you at work ill be watchin cable
Wit ya girl dancin' naked on my new pool table
I don't want to work no more
Modern day slavery knockin on my front door
Can't see my kids can't see my wife
Can't see a way to control my own life
Said I don't want to work no more
Modern day slavery knockin on my front door
Can't see my kids can't see..
Ah man I got to sell like a twenty doller rock, y'all keep singing, Ill be right back

(Melody)
I quit my job this morning'
I don't want to work no more
Fuck MacDonald's and Taco Bell, modern day slave rails
Is knocking on my front door
Get you a big fat sack of yayo
Can't see my kids can't see my wife
Can't see a way to control my dog-on life
