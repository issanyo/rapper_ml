[Verse 1]
A little ditty, about the Afroman
A Mississippi rapper, doin the best he can
Afro gon be a hip-hop star
Freestylin in the back of that police car

[Hook]
Oh yeah, life goes on
Long after the Sheriff Department is gone
Oh yeah, I said life goes on
Long after the Sheriff Department is gone

[Verse 2]
Afro got some weed, and hit the bong
He hit the jackpot, when he wrote a hit song
+Because I got High+
Signed with Universal, cuz he was havin fun
But they took his money, like Enron

[Hook]
And oh yeah, life goes on
Long after the thrill of riches is gone
Oh yeah, I said life goes on
Long after the thrill of riches is gone

[Verse 3]
Broke and alone, in a cheap motel
Afro spots a bible and he says "what the hell"
Mama said it's better to give, than it is to receive
Afro went to church and said "I believe"
Universal loved Afro when he was on top
But when he became a Christian, that's when he got dropped
But Jesus would comfort Afro when he prayed
Jesus said "Don't worry bout that money
People download your music off the internet anyway"
Jesus said

[Hook]
And oh yeah, life goes on
Long after corrupt record companies go bankrupt
Oh yeah, I said life goes on
Long after corrupt record companies go bankrupt

[Verse 4]
So let em steal, let em do all this wrong
Let em make evil videos, and encourage evil songs
Keep rippin off artists for as long as you can
People go to the internet and make you a broke man (Laughing)
