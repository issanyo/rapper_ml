Being a man
All these sexy women
Don't understand
Things we need to do yeah
Every other day or two

Baby

In the year 2000
I see thousand
Of pretty young women I found arousin
Grocery store shoppin
Magazine browsin
Many different ways to keep their hair styles in
Full of boredom
I walk toward em
Get em close to me
Cause I'm suppose to be
Male aggressor
Female impresser
Say the right things possibly undress her
But that's the post game
This is still the pre game
Silly woman she game
Baby what's your name
Even though I'm a freak
I play it off like a college geek
Crack a smile and politely speak
With intellect to the women I select
Hoping that she don't detect
My egotistical chauvinistical lust
I thrust till I scream like Mystikal
YAAAAAAHHHH!
The wrong message I hope I'm not sendin
Laughin and pretendin my dick's not extendin
Can't be over zealous she might discover
She's walking away BITCH! blew my cover

She won't let me fuck (you know I love it)
I really need to bust a nut (please don't change the subject)
She won't let me fuck (we could've fucked all night long)
I really need to bust a nut (but you telephone number is bone)
She won't let me fuck (girl you got a lot to give)
I really need to bust a nut (you dress so provocative yeah)
She won't let me fuck (I can see your lingerie from real far away)
I really need to bust a nut (bitch! you must think I'm gay)

Aw don't make me beg
Baby let me rub your leg
Don't make me cry
Look into my eyes
Girl you so damn pretty
Stop acting so sadiddy
Let me rub some oil on your ti hahaha
Yo I'm up outta here she don't want to fuck cuz
