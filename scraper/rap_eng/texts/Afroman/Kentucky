The night before your wedding I dreamed what I would say
I beg you for forgiveness for all the mess I made
I dreamed that you were gracious, I dreamed you wished me well
I dreamed that you were vicious, you damned me straight to hell
But oh sweet Kentucky
No matter where I land
I was just a boy for you
And he will be your man
And I was just a boy for you
And he will be your man
I'd tell you that I'm lonely and fame has let me down
Living like a stranger, traveling town to town
And all my aspirations don't amount to much
The wine and the women are such a shameful crutch
But oh sweet Kentucky
No matter where I land
Cause I was just a boy for you
And he will be your man
And I was just a boy for you
And he will be your man
I know you will be happy and I'll be in the band
Cause I was just a boy for you
And he will be your man
And I was just a boy for you
