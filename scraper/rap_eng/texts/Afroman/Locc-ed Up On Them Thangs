(Chorus/Intro)
Locc-ed up on them thangs(locked up them thangs), Bouncing on them sprangs(bouncing on them springs), New sound system bangs(new sound system bangs), Like a black Tarzan I swang(like a black Tarzan I swang)

(Verse 1)
I roll passed your ass real fast, High on grass locked up on them chrome 13s, Pornos on my my tv screens, Dipping and hopping, Banging and bopping, Hoppin and dropping never stopping, Drop the back raise the front 3 wheel motion is all I want, 3 Wheel to the left, 3 Wheel to the right, 3 Wheel on every single corner in sight, Cut it real hard and hold it, step on the gas baby roll it, Pop it like a willie, Smoke it like a philly, Drop it down, jack it up and straight clown

(Chorus)
Locc-ed up on them thangs(locked up them thangs), Bouncing on them sprangs(bouncing on them springs), New sound system bangs(new sound system bangs), Like a black Tarzan I swang(like a black Tarzan I swang)

Verse 2
Everytime you see me, I'm ontop driving in my hardtop or my drop, Drop down to the ground, Hop back up to the hip hop sound, Keep on Rollin money foldin pockets swollen we Goin Bowlin, We Goin to the movies like cheese Rollin on Ds sitting on 3's, We finna shoot some pool but on our way there we gonna act a fool, After that ride home and play chess check mate baby this the wild wild west, I'm a perfectionist, I'm like to good to actually exist, But I do rumors are true and when the girls see my car they be like oooo

(Chorus/Outro)
Locc-ed up on them thangs(locked up them thangs), Bouncing on them sprangs(bouncing on them springs), New sound system bangs(new sound system bangs), Like a black Tarzan I swang(like a black Tarzan I swang)
