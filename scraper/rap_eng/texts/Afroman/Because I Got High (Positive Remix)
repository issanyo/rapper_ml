Ironically, I care about everything!

I had problems with glaucoma, but then I got high
Smelled the cannabis aroma, and I got high
Glaucoma getting better and I know why
Because I got high, because I got high, because I got high

I used to smoke cigarettes, but then I got high
Getting tired and call it quits, but them I got high
I'm playing basketball and jogging and I know why
Because I got high, because I got high, because I got high

I used to drink beer and wine, but then I got high
I woke up feeling fine, because I got high
My hangover's over and I know why
Because I got high, because I got high, because I got high

Anxiety attacks, but then I got high
I used to take Xanax, but then I got high
No more prescription pills and I know why
Because I got high, because I got high, because I got high

The state made revenue, because I got high
They built a school or two, because I got high
Now the state can fund drug treatment and I know why
Because I got high, because I got high, because I got high

No more criminal traps if it's legalised
I don't have to buy from gang bangers shooting craps, if it's legalised
I can advocate with Weedmaps and I know why
It's legalised, it's legalised, it's legalised
