You better not 'pout, you better not shout
I slap your grandmomma's dentures out
Afroman is coming to town

Slapping her once, I'm slapping her twice
A no-teeth blowjob feels real nice
Afroman is coming to town

I know that you've been smoking all my tumble weed
I looked into my dub sack all I seen was stems and seeds
You better get dressed, hit the door
Go to the dub spot and buy some mo'
Afroman is coming to town

All kinda states, all kinda cities
All kinda women yelling "Sign my titties"
Afroman is coming to town

All the ladies in the crowd givin' me hugs
And all the fellas givin' me nugs
Afroman is coming to town

The cops always know there's drugs at the show
Before they get to the stage, I smoke up all the draw
Oh read me my rights, take me to jail
The weeds all gone and I'm high as hell
Afroman is coming to town
