(Let me hit it!)

[Hook]
Hit this, hit this, hit this blunt with me
Baby
Hit this, hit this, hit this blunt with me
Darling
Hit this, hit this, hit this blunt with me
Baby
Hit this, hit this, hit this blunt with me

Well, it's the hungry hustler, Afro Man
Rims and Vogues on the Astro Van
Money coming in like a Palmdale Pimp
Double-O G with a low key limp

Always stand to myself
Concentrate on my wealth
Greater than your highest expectation
I run the world, let alone the nation
Doing it every day
Looking good, making pay
Smoking the best
From the west
Palmdale High
Across my chest
It's lonely at the top
But I like it
It's a brew punch and spike it

Who make this money?
Me, that's who!
I'ma smoke more weed
And drink more brew!

[Hook]

All the girls
Gather 'round
When Afroman
Comes to town

Hugging me
Kissing me
Bugging me
Dissing me

I'm in dank dimension
Love female attention
I'm down to Earth
But I'm top notch
C-walk like hopscotch

Snap your fingers
Bob your head
Hit the blunt
Make your bread

Stay on top like the boy dog
Life is something to enjoy dog
Take it, baby
All the way
When I hear you moan
I feel okay

Climax--
Fire up a tree
Baby--
Hit the blunt with me

[Hook]
