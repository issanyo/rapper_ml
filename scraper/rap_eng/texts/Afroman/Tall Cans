Ahhhh shit!  Shit!  Shit!
Now, I'm walking down the street with some chicken and a forty
I'm yelling at these hoochies and I'm looking for a party
Drink it fast, make it last, 'til you know it ain't no mo'
Run outta dough, slap the ho
Get the dough and go back to that liquor sto'

[Hook - repeat 4X]
Afroman likes tall cans

Now I'm a afroholic, call me Afroman
Love to sag my khakis with a tall can
My homies pop the forty of some St. Ides
Now that mother (uh!) staggering from side to side
Now, we the loudest homeboys in my neighborhood
We look real bad but we feel so good
My thirst is quenched but my craving won't extinguish
I need some forty ounce mother (uh!) Old English
Put the top in my mouth, put the bottom to the ceiling
Drink it down down until I get that crazy feeling
Now just walking down the street with some chicken and a forty
I'm yelling at these hoochies and I'm looking for a party
Drink it fast, make it last, 'til you know it ain't no mo'
Run outta dough, slap the ho
Get the do' and go back to that liquor sto'

[Hook]

See these girls be acting all bad and rude
Always got a bad attitude
See I just wanna dance, why can't you get the picture
You act like a brother wanna move in with you
I gots no fame, I gots no wealth
So I wind up dancing by my goddamn self
But I paid my money, just like you
And baby I'mma do what I came to do
You see I can't wait around 'til I get rich
Just to make yo' gold digging attitude switch
So I'm walking down the street with some chicken and a forty
I'm yelling at these hoochies and I'm looking for a party
Drink it fast, make it last, 'til you know it ain't no mo'
Run outta dough, slap the ho
Get the do' and go back to that liquor sto'

I stepped into this party full of Mexicans
I didn't realize I was the only black man
One hand on my bottle, the other on my peter
I barked like a dog and started freaking senoritas
I think she was embarrassed with the eight ball in my cup
She kept on stepping back so I kept on stepping up
This vato strolled up, put his gun to my head
I knew if I moved I was officially dead
That had to be his woman, I know it doggonit
That ain't the first time that I got confronted
Got my quete, "What up, ese?  Get the fuck outta here!"
I said, "I'm gone mother fucker, now give me my beer."
Cause I'm just walking down the street with some chicken and a forty
I'm yelling at these hoochies and I'm looking for a party
Drink it fast, make it last, 'til you know it ain't no mo'
Run outta dough, slap the ho
Get the do' and go back to that liquor sto'

[Chrous]

HO HO HO HO HO HO HO HO HO
HO HO HO HO HO HO HO HO HO
Walkin down the street with some chicken and a forty
Yellin at these hoochies and I'm lookin for a party
Drink it fast, make it last, 'til you know it ain't no mo'
Outta dough, slap the ho
Get the do' and go back to that liquor sto'

[Hook]
