[Chorus]
Jumped up G'd Up
Lit the fuckin weed up
Push Down the Gas pedal
Cadillac speed up x4

[Verse 1]
Afroman Caravan, travel all across the land
Getting people fucked up drunk high yup yup
Ladies in the house tonight lets get high as a kite
Dance to the music bang and abuse it
Use it to satisfy, use it to gratify
Will you get mad if i rub you on your ass and thigh
Pull your body close to me thats were you supposed to be
All day all night get it right keep it tight
Fellas in the house tonight give your homeboy a light
Imma pass around the blunt imma get your head right
Imma keep the party live drink colt 45
Everybody walkin home cops won't let nobody drive
Your girlfriend im takin out she talkin about makin out
When you get drunk and high your punk ass be flakin out
Thats why we breaking out butt cheeks shaking out
I said i had to cum she dont want me to take it out

[Chorus]
Jumped up G'd Up
Lit the fuckin weed up
Push Down the Gas pedal
Cadillac speed up x4

[Verse 2]
Afroman everywhere, marijuana in the air
If you drunk if you high scream out hell yeah
Always have a good time always bust a good rhyme
Always drink colt 45 always smoke a fat dime
Get the party drunk and high hands up in the sky
Everyday i live like this imma party till i die
Afroman comin back with yo woman in my lap

Dancin to my brand new track damn its time to make a stack
Can't wait on the corporate world, gotta feed my baby girl
Thank god for the internet how much money can i get
Afroman music dot com make my money cool and calm
Keep makin music till Im in heaven with dad and mom
But right now im still on earth milkin it for what its worth
East side palmdale is my turf, coupe deville is what i serve
Make these hits one by one your favourite rapper till im done
Ain't no one like afroman, smoke some weed, be my fan

[Chorus]
Jumped up G'd Up
Lit the fuckin weed up
Push Down the Gas pedal
Cadillac speed up x4

[Verse 3]
Hungry hustler afroman palmdale pimp ho bitch can't stand
Twenty houses fifty cars stacy adams all star
Shining like chrome ds bringin home all the cheese
Black white japanese ladies down on your knees
I dont gamble take a chance end up in a circumstance
I work hard and hold on to it if i can then you can do it
By myself is how i hang make my money and do my thang
No more drama in my life dont come around my kids and wife
Mike joby mike joby colt 45 and oh ee any dope valley o-g
At the party blowin on my hoe-zee
Af-Ro Sama-Bin-Smokin Pussy pokin and hundred spoken

[Chorus]
Jumped up G'd Up
Lit the fuckin weed up
Push Down the Gas pedal
Cadillac speed up x4
