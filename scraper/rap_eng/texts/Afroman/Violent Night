Drink some wine, smoke some blunt with me
Call up some friends and play this CD

Merry Christmas to all of you (merry Christmas)
I say yeah, Merry Christmas to all of you (ohh oh)

Silent Night
Po-Police lights
Stop the engine
Keep your hansd inside
Cops surround me with pistols in hand
Three outstanding warrants for Joseph Foreman
Sleep in the county jail
Can't post no bail

I wanna wish you a...
Merry Christmas to all of you (merry Christmas)
Merry Christmas.... to all of you

Silent night
Hand cuffs are tied
People staring at me
At the red red light
Ninety five hundred I see a far
[?] in the custody car
Sleep in the county jail
Can't post no bail
