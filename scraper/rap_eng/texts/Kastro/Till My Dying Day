[Intro: 2Pac & Aunt Glo]
I'm so sick of muthafuckas askin' me
How our parents feel about us
Calling these hoes bitches
So Aunt Glo
Why don't you tell them how we do it
(In the late night)
I'm tired of these bitches calling my house
Asking for the Young Thugz
(In the late night)
Young Thugz ain't got time for no bitches
They trying to get rich
Stop calling
(In the late now)
(Come on Aunt Glo)
(That's word from my Auntie nigga)
Baby!

[Verse 1: Outlawz]

[E.D.I Mean]
Now it's been a long, day
I'm straight hustling to getting pay
But now it's evening, and I'm scheming of play
I got a call, from that Dogg nigga K

[Kastro]
And I was bored, so nigga I'll be on my way
Who got the hoes for Hollywood? I think he might
And I suppose, nigga we up in the night

[Kadafi]
That's right them [?] be staring
With Lil Moo in the cut and that nigga all in

[Napoeon]
So what the fucking drink had me tripping
But I'll be damned if I let another motherfucker catch me slipping
We've been in the car nigga

[Kadafi]
We in the drive way
Because the night is young and I'm ready to hit the highway
And now it's all for that
These night call's we strapped
You know how niggas be black

[E.D.I Mean]
Now we smoking weed that we need
So let's get the game right
And baked tight in the late night

[Hook: 2Pac]
Preoccupied with
Straight balling, can you hear the liquor calling
I'm sick of hoes nigga fuck 'em all
Everyday is a bit of play
Getting paid, thug nigga 'til I see my dying day
Preoccupied with
Straight balling, can you hear the liquor calling
I'm sick of hoes nigga fuck 'em all
Everyday is a bit of play
Getting paid, thug nigga 'til I see my dying day

[Verse 2: Outlawz]

[Kadafi]
Now it's 206 tell me
Who the fuck I'm having sex with?
Gaming these cousin's in the Lexus from Texas

[Kastro]
Expect to last past 6 'cause I'm restless
My head blasted off this Sess that I mess with

[E.D.I Mean]
The best, click is who we choose so we making moves
Ain't in no mood for no faking moves
So is it true?
I'm asking now
'Cause if not, you and your crew could be stashed and out

[Napoleon]
Without a doubt
These bitches know we do it right
Fuck it and they suck us
That's how we do it on the late night

[Verse 3: 2Pac]
Bitches don't even have a clue
I keep up with my scandalous crew
Boxes of blunts and brew, well can you handle this too?
Step up and let me put this pimping in your ear
The game is clear, this place is packed, let's disappear
Now we can hit the highway and go to my place
But be cautious
Once we arrive can I toss it?
No hesitation, this fornication and situation
Fucking these hoes up to the attic, back down to the basement
No replacement, I hit you with a piece then I flee
Back to the streets is how I do it, ain't no peace for a G
And my motto, a blunt some coochie and a cold bottle
I'm fucking them hoochies and the supermodels
The game is deep, I can't sleep 'cause there's cum on my sheets
Sampling bitches like a break beat, the liquor makes me
And when it's late I'm like a convict that just escaped
Hitting these hoochies 'til they break, in the late night

[Hook: 2Pac]
(In the late night)
Straight balling, can you hear the liquor calling?
I'm sick of hoes nigga fuck 'em all (In the late night)
Everyday is a bit of play, getting paid, thug nigga 'til I see my dying day (this is how we do it)
Preoccupied with
Straight balling, can you hear the liquor calling?
I'm sick of hoes nigga fuck 'em all
Everyday is a bit of play, getting paid, thug nigga 'til I see my dying day
Preoccupied with
Straight balling, can you hear the liquor calling?
I'm sick of hoes nigga fuck 'em all
Everyday is a bit of play, getting paid, thug nigga 'til I see my dying day
Preoccupied with, straight balling, can you hear the liquor calling?
I'm sick of hoes nigga fuck 'em all
Everyday is a bit of play, getting paid, thug nigga 'til I see my dying day

[Outro: 2Pac]
Thug life nigga
Young thugz, Young Thugz, thug sisters
The whole muthafuckin' thug nation
You know see, keep your head up
Keep your motherfuckin money in you pocket
No muthafuckin' mercy, no muthafuckin' mercy
