[Chorus: Nutt-So]
Murder and pain come wit' the game if you choose to roll
Kickin' doughs, puttin' holes in mothafuckas leavin' hoes disposed of
Nigga lay ya down when I creep, on a mission to send ya six feet
Nigga don’t sleep

[Verse 1: E.D.I Mean]
Now in my every way get murmuring, I'm on a quest to tease better shit
Positioned myself to pops states the path whatever dig
Nutt-So we got to live, we stepped ahead of these cowards
Half-hearted bitch niggas that love the taste of the power
But it's only the chosen, as we continue on blowin' shit
Even in the afterlife, we still blast tonight
In plain do that nigga shoulda stay truest
State of the war got go sleepin', no one leavin', now we eating

[Verse 2: Napoleon]
It don’t quit it, don’t stop
You pay a bitch, I’ll pay a crooked cop
Then hustle on the block, and stack my money that I future plot
Young Napoleon, Napole-on, it’s on, it’s on again
When liquor sip touched my liver, tell me will it ever end
I’m tired of mournin'
Wake up to another dead in the mornin'
Pray ‘fore I went to bed, still woke up dreamin' lead
These bitches and them vultures that surround my group
They wanna talk and drink a brew and claim they Thug Life too

[Chorus: Nutt-So]
Murder and pain come wit' the game if you choose to roll
Kickin' doughs, puttin' holes in mothafuckas leavin' hoes disposed of
Nigga lay ya down when I creep, on a mission to send ya six feet
Nigga don’t sleep

[Verse 3: Yaki Kadafi]
I blast first to they body, like my guns in varieties
Runnin' wit' the real big willies, that you silly punks try to be
But front, doin' my walk-bys rollin' blunts
Hands on my nuts in a getaway car full’a stunts
Addicted to my nine, movin' like crime through time
Poppin' niggas like pimples, nigga nuttin' simple 'bout mine
Etch a sketch it, dumpin' on all you punks at intersections
Day in and day out, ain't no easy way out on easy exits
Don’t sleep

[Verse 4: Kastro]
Walkin' dead in the back, passed out
My head talkin' to my damn self-stretched vexed
In my bed, and if I rest
How much I wanna bet how fast I fall over?
The edge on my face flat, but fuck that I’m a soldier
Wide open, tired of livin' lies got me locin'
On mama’s eyes, the drama side won’t stop 'til I smoke ’em, potent
So I’m chokin', floatin', on my feet
Since these bitch niggas creep, why the fuck should I sleep?

[Verse 5: Nutt-So]
Dumpin' on mothafuckas at random, rapidly
Wit' accuracy, they shouldn'ta' talked bad to me
It had to be, a mothafuckin' murder I’m glad to be
The nigga that did the murder so sad to see
Another mothafucka dead, layin' in red
Wit' a big ass hole in his head, received by a thug (Nigga), no love
As I bloodied up his mothafuckin' mug picture
Snatched him up off the asphalt, then drove off to the hills positioned him on his knees and blew the back off
Twisted his cap off, wrapped him up in plastic
Slid to the edge, and dumped his ass off
Then notified his whole family, of this tragedy
Murdered 'em without askin' me, who did it
Catastrophe is how I left it and you won’t see the last of me nigga
And I betcha, he got wet up, don't sleep
'Cause you fuckin' wit' realest nigga
You jeopardizin' lives when you fuckin' wit' soldiers
Fucked him up with extendo know (Ahh shit, haha)
Not with the sticks mothafucka, it’s game over

[Verse 6: 2Pac]
When I enter the first zone, worst known mic holder
My Hummer roll up, evacuating strapped soldiers
Inside strategy, manifestin' military styles
Casual tragedy when niggas battle me
My Prophecized prediction, switch and move positions
Separated from his gun and bitch, and watch 'em start snitchin'
I keep spittin', still stupid niggas fail to listen
I personify this thug livin'; Hell or prison
My ammunition varies, my voice carries
Watch me invite the whole world me and the mob gettin' married
It seems horrifying screams pierce the dark
Just as suspected, a trick bitch where is your heart
You mark, watch niggas fall when I call they name
We outlaws hold your head niggas all the same
Except some who want more out of life than stress
We still thuggin' 'til it's no one left
Don't sleep

[Chorus: Nutt-So]
Murder and pain come wit' the game if you choose to roll
Kickin' doughs, puttin' holes in mothafuckas leavin' hoes disposed of
Nigga lay ya down when I creep, on a mission to send ya six feet
Nigga don’t sleep
