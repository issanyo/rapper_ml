[Verse 1]
We sway our words
Convince the world
That we are so different
Fly like birds
And then we hurt
Caught in a prison
Haunt like ghost
I'm on my own
I never cared
Mistakes I've told
I'm getting high
It's getting old
To lose myself within my soul
Because I'm still out here sitting and wondering
The burst of fear got me sitting and stuttering

[Hook]
Martyrs wake up
To the sounds of hell and disbelief
Watch me
Take you
To the places you can't ever see
Wonder
Waking
All my darkness wants to thrive
Screaming
Aching
I see these nightmares come alive

[Post-Hook]
I see these nightmares come alive
I see these nightmares come alive
Oh
Oh
Oh
Oh

[Verse 2]
Silence been my best friend
Don't ever do this for attention
It's a blessing
It's my everything
Even this whole thing
Don't mean a thing
I'm the strings that play and sway so fast
You see the shadows in the back you laugh
I make it fire but the price so bad
Try to imagine every day I crash

[Hook]
Martyrs wake up
To the sounds of hell and disbelief
Watch me
Take you
To the places you can't ever see
Wonder
Waking
All my darkness wants to thrive
Screaming
Aching
I see these nightmares come alive
Martyrs wake up
To the sounds of hell and disbelief
Watch me
Take you
To the places you can't ever see
Wonder
Waking
All my darkness wants to thrive
Screaming
Aching
I see these nightmares come alive
