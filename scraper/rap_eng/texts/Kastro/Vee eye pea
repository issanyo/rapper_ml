[Verse 2: TrippyThaKid]
Past the blunt
I'm ready to dip
Like half the blunt was already lit
I'm hoping to god that religion legit
Cause i'm talking to ghosts all alone in the wipe
Fucking around cause i'm Trippythakid
What the fuck you talking about little bitch
I don't want to know shit
I don't want to know this
I don't want to know that
I just wanna be rich
Fucking around cause i'm Trippythakid
What the fuck you talking about little bitch
I don't want to know shit
I don't want to know this
I don't want to know that
I just wanna be rich
Main bitch in the back
Where the peace signs at
Where the kid gets caped
And the bitch won't laugh
And none of them rest
Cause the kid to fast
And i'm all drink'd out
With the see mom trap
Go to them fucking
I'm tired of loving these motherfuckers
Who could never do nothin'
Unloaded
Corroded
And hopin they rollin in the bends
The way that I told them to do
THC is in my blood
That shit forever
123 I guess i'l fucking add a letter
ABC I guess i'l fucking add a number
LSD I started tripping in the summer

[Verse 3: Jessie]
Whole world's been sedated
Y'all been sleepin' on us
I'm out here smokin' on Jamaican
Got a pint in my cup
My momma told me I'ma make it
Bitch I'm in no rush
But lately I've been so impatient
So I gotta Get Buck
I feel like Pouya
When I pull up to the scene
With the all black 'llac
I gotta bad bitch in the back of the whip
On my lap
On Snapchat
Aye, yo Trippy where the hash at
Homie I'm going retarded and shit
I'm fuckin' around with Trippythakid
These bitch's be loving the music we make
And we tour
Where ready to pop off
I'l fuck up a bitch with my socks off
Bitch I'm too lit like a rockstar
How you going say we not hard
Me and Trippy some motherfuckin' outlaws
