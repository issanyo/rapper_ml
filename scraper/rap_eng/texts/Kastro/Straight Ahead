[Hook]
You can't stop me no way
You can't stop me no way, yeah
I got a fist full of courage and baby I'm free
Ain't nobody fucking with me
You can't stop me no way
You can't stop me no way, yeah
I got a fist full of courage and baby I'm free
Ain't nobody fuckin' with me
You can't stop me

[Verse 1: Edidon]
Time to show 'em where I came from
Turn the hate into congratulations
It's paper come and paper go
Will I live to see tomorrow I ain't knowin
But I ain't scared to find out
Halfway buried in my grave 'bout to, climb out
Shit, I put these little niggas on time out
Grown folks talkin' shut your mu'fuckin' mouth, boy
All the chit chat ain't lies
Pillow talkin' with them hoes, that's how pussy niggas die
TMZ asking questions, shout out to Vlad and Thriller
But I ain't got nothing to say unless we talking about millions
So much speculation, ain't no hesitation in me
Pacing back and forth, talking to myself
My friend is the man in the mirror
Time to stand and deliver
Hear the whispers in my ears
Switch gears either now or never
Searching for heaven, I'm hustlin' going through hell
My will is never surrender, they rather witness me fail
I broke up with my past, now I'm fucking on my future
My side bitch is the present, a gift, lost in the moment
I'm sick, blowin' on Sticky
Either she with me or against me
I'm still in the game, already made history
I'm really with the shit, really spit that shit
Legendary clique, enemies rest in piss
Finger fuckin' a four fifth

[Hook: King Sunda]
You can't stop me no way
You can't stop me no way, yeah
I got a fist full of courage and baby I'm free
Ain't nobody fucking with me
You can't stop me no way
You can't stop me no way, yeah
I got a fist full of courage and baby I'm free
Ain't nobody fuckin' with me
You can't stop me

[Verse 2]
Thought it would last forever
But nothing lasts forever
How could this be? Now I'm yellin'
No feelings, 'till they rolling me in a swisher
Like they did my nigga, now he always riding with us
Life goes on, but only if we don't hold on
Get the picture, let it go
The pain made a better flow
A name you'll forever know
Bumpin' in yo shit since 90-fuckin' four
Who the hell you think they want?
When they going through a thang
Package got caught up and plus his baby mama playing games
He be on that Pac shit, he be on that outlaw shit
Type of music to help a nigga get through it and deal with it
Ain't no turning back now, we goin' lay the facts down
Class is in session sit yo ass down, and listen close
Been doing the impossible, been putting out classics
But all they want to know is did we smoke the Don ashes?
Yeah, I answer all y'all questions, but then I got to go
The question I'ma ask is how bad you wanna know?
The fame and the money, it took my friends and my family
I got issues I'm still dealing with, give a fuck 'bout a grammy
Look, my kids can't eat that love, but I appreciate it
Took an oath, put it in my flesh, I've been initiated
Waitin' for the rain to turn to sunshine, just one time
We yellin' "Fuck one time" 'cause they did it one more time
How much can we take before we break or bang back?
Let it be known, It's a fact
When I tell you that they can't stop us

[Verse 3: Kastro]
Can't stop us, hey look
I took a left on a right, I was incorrect
I ask you please don't be upset with my disconnect
Just had to press reset so I could redirect
Then address these regrets with the proper due respect
I was left with nothing left, what do you expect?
I learned it ain't what you deserve, you get what you accept
I'm up early in the morning like I never slept
Hey nigga, miss me with your threats, you won't bust a sweat
Remember I was down bad, chasin' percocets
With vodka and wild turkey, like a circus set
My purpose ain't have purpose, that's a certain fact
I scratch my way from out the bottom, ain't no going back
Naah, relationships I had to reconsider
And come to grips without being bitter
I had to focus on the bigger picture
And quit worrying about the credit, they don't give a nigga
And quit worrying 'bout the credit, they won't give a nigga

[Hook]
You can't stop me no way
You can't stop me no way, yeah
I got a fist full of courage and baby I'm free
Ain't nobody fucking with me
You can't stop me no way
You can't stop me no way, yeah
I got a fist full of courage and baby I'm free
Ain't nobody fuckin' with me
You can't stop me
