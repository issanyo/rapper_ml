There you go actin' like a ho
Again, there you go, there you go
There you go actin' like a ho
Again, there you go, there you go

[2Pac]: I don't know why I be fuckin witchu

[Verse 1: 2Pac]
Was it the liquor, that makes me act blind, times that I'm with her
Anonymous pictures of other niggas tryin' to kiss her
Will I love her or shall I diss her?
I'm sick of this scandalous shit I deal wit', tryin' to paint a perfect picture
My memories of jealousy no longer carefree
Cause so much bullshit your girlfriends keep tellin' me
I'm on tour, but now my bedroom's an open door
So it got me thinkin', what am I tryin' for?
When I was young I was so very dumb, eager to please
A lil', trick on a mission tryin' to get him a piece
Me and my niggas is thug niggas, former known drug dealers
We don't love bitches and believe they don't love niggas
I gotta blame my attraction
But you became a distraction, a threat to my paper stackin'
I thought you changed but now I know
Can't turn a ho into a housewife, baby, and there you go

[Hook:]
There you go actin' like a ho
Again, there you go, there you go
There you go actin' like a ho
Again, there you go, there you go

[Verse 2: Big Syke]
I should have never trusted you, from the jump
You disgust me so much, you make me look like Willy Lump
With your ready made plans, did you shake your man, yet?
Did you resell him, did you tell him how I make you wet?
I can't forget when we met conservative but freaky
Irresistible, critical, positive but sneaky
It's a shame we played games so many nights
You squeeze me tight but in my mind I knew it wasn't right
But out of sight, is out of mind is how I thought of you
I can't compare with no sentimental value
Your nig' would wig if he knew the things you done to me
His little sweetie scooped up so easily but never me
I was lost in the things you did
Hidin' my cigs, tellin' me how much you wanted my kids
But love don't love nobody feelings change
Guess you had to rearrange, and there you go

[Hook:]
There you go actin' like a ho
Again, there you go, there you go
There you go actin' like a ho
Again, there you go, there you go

[Verse 3: Kastro]
These silly bitches got this game twisted
So I ain't really tryin' to claim bitches
Niggas who don't hang come put your "D" on the same bitches
That be the main bitches who say they loyal
Promise to do some thangs before you, kill for you, but maintain your spoils, truly
Cutie, booty big, but that ain't movin' nothing in my crib
When I could see from the door she sure ain't shit
But you in love with her, want to go to the club with her
And when you stuck, she up like an ordinary thug nigga

[Verse 4: Yaki Kadafi]
See girlfriend I know, your whole M.O's preoccupied with mostly
Gettin' clown after clown, town coast to coast, see
I been trying to stay away from sluts like you
Got me turned off completely by that sheisty shit that you do
Knew from jump your aim, straight through them spandex
Don't front, just name
Spots on yo' body for me to touch while you clutch this game
I keep flowin' like H20, it ain't nothing for me to say
Why you keep actin' like a hoe
But there you go

[Hook:]
There you go actin' like a ho
Again, there you go, there you go
There you go actin' like a ho
Again, there you go, there you go
There you go actin' like a ho
Again, there you go, there you go
There you go actin' like a ho
Again, there you go, there you go
There you go actin' like a ho
Again, there you go, there you go
There you go actin' like a ho
Again
