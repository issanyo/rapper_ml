[Chorus]
Flex, flex flex
Flex, flex flex

[Verse 1: 2Pac]
Slippin' through my shit wonderin' what hits it get
Even before the flicks I was always hit to flip the script
Let's play a game, call catch a bitch, how you play?
Well diss me nigga and catch a fist, you playin'?
Ooo, I know you didn't expect a nigga to catch wreck
I'm comin' from the west, they all slept (Flex)
'Cause it's been a long day
And I get with Johnny Q when niggas rub me the wrong way
Twenty four tracks is fat and all that
Pack smack, jaw crack, after that, can I get my balls back?
Nigga don't front, just pass the blunt
I freak the funk for the trunks, pop the pump on the chumps
I make ya jump
Dum diddy dump, love to thump
Leavin' niggas with Plumps, smokin' blunts and skunks
So here it comes, let's have a gun
Or get done by the worst of our trumps for fun
Pump pump!

[Chorus]
Flex, flex, flex flex
Flex, flex flex
Flex, flex flex
Flex, flex flex

[Verse 2: Kastro]
OH! duck, prepare to throw nigga, get that ass dropped
Give us mad props and get packed I'm mad hot
So get that 'caine step to the wrong fuckin' man
