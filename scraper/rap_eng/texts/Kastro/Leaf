Well if you need some time then
I'll be right here waiting for you
Seasons pass my branches hate the snow
My roots roam deeper in the ground
For every single year I ponder if I'll ever change
The place you left me here to grow
I digress
You mustn't have gone far
I only saw you walk into the distance
Outta sight not outta mind
And yet I'm stuck here reminiscing
The time you, carved your name into my skin
And left it there to scar
I know that out of every thing you'd do
You'd never break my heart
I'm swearing there's no fraction or chance
I know that one day you'll come back
And with a passionate glance
You'll take my branch right in your hand
And maybe then we can dance
I'm sure the distance only sparks the romance, right?
You know I love you, all these years and still I'm damn hype
I said I'd wait here forever year I swear on me it's true
'Cause the only thing I love more than life, is well, you
But you said you needed space
And then you ghosted me out of the blue

You took my hand like no would
I loved you harder than I should
You set me down and never let it up
I'm stuck here wondering if I'll ever be enough
You took the air right from my lungs
I gasped and fought for just a touch
We said these things we never meant
I'll never understand would could go on inside your head
