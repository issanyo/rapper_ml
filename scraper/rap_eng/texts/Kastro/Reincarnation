[Intro: 2Pac]
Are you scared to die?
Is reincarnation
Are you - are you afraid to die?
(Reach the whole nation)
Me? (murderer)
My only fear of death is reincarnation
Uh

[Hook: 2Pac]
My only fear of death, is reincarnation
I use my last breath, to reach the whole nation
How can they call me murderer for my spoken words?
This composition be my prophecy I hope it's heard
My only fear of death, is reincarnation
I use my last breath, to reach the whole nation
How can they call me murderer for my spoken words?
This composition be my prophecy I hope it's heard

[Verse 1: 2Pac]
Hard words is spoken, many promises broken
As if it's, useless to hope, they got me constantly smoking
My role model was a cold bottle of O.E
Surrounded by my closest homies but nobody knows me
I pray to God it ain't easy
Half the cops in California got a hard on to squeeze me
Running through the backstreets, hopping over fences
Tryna shake the fucking K-9s, running around senseless
I'll prolly be a mystery to many, but a legend to some
I've been a man for many women, but husband for none
In case you see me out in traffic, looking nervous and high
My hands, holding my pistols will they serve us or die?
May God forgive me for my crooked ways, I didn't mean it
Knew I'd fall in love with money the first day that I seen it
Maybe now they can understand it's my occupation
It's clear that my only fear of death is reincarnation

[Hook: 2Pac]
My only fear of death, is reincarnation
I use my last breath, to reach the whole nation
How can they call me murderer for my spoken words?
This composition be my prophecy, I hope it's heard
My only fear of death, is reincarnation
I use my last breath, to reach the whole nation
How can they call me murderer for my spoken words?
This composition be my prophecy, I hope it's heard

[Verse 2: Hussein Fatal]
I keep my shit off safety, I've been shooting rocks lately
Everybody gots they nickel plates to penetrate me
I was supposed to be the murder first to go
Them niggas missing, grazed my wrist, I took it personal
Kato told me that I was slipping, got his strap and started tripping
Slipped two clips on the table, twist the L and said "Fatal listen"
Everybody don't be missing keep your vest on, baby
And you know that shit that happens to the Teflon, crazy
You ain't gotta pack a gat, I got your backs keep your front line
Or we can stall that, from the Cadillac we about to bum shot
But Reeg locked down, (so) it's still begging casket
All we thought about was plastic and murdering bastards

[Hook: 2Pac]
My only fear of death, is reincarnation
I use my last breath, to reach the whole nation
How can they call me murderer for my spoken words?
This composition is my prophecy, I hope it's heard
My only fear of death, is reincarnation
I use my last breath, to reach the whole nation
How can they call me murderer for my spoken words?
This composition is my prophecy, I hope it's heard

[Verse 3: E.D.I Mean]
I spend my days and nights, not knowing if it strays in flight
Gon' finally catch me, leaving my foes hella happy
'Cause look, at any moment, the game could be my main opponent
Niggas be swimming where the sharks in, and don't even know it
But I stay focused, concentrate on my surroundings
'Cause if I'm slipping, well that's when niggas will get to clowning
And I can't have it, I got a mission to complete
Raise my kids upright, make sure they got something to eat
And my daily ritual is, protect my physical biz
I just can't see now, I choose death before the penal
'Cause what good am I to that little nigga with them big eyes?
If I'm incarcerated, you feel me now I gots to make it
And If I don't, Re-Reincarnation ain't an option
Leave my ass dead until it's really poppin'

[Hook: 2Pac]
My only fear of death, is reincarnation
I use my last breath, to reach the whole nation
How can they call me murderer for my spoken words?
This composition is my prophecy, I hope it's heard
My only fear of death, is reincarnation
I use my last breath, to reach the whole nation
How can they call me murderer for my spoken words?
This composition is my prophecy, I hope it's heard
My only fear of death, is reincarnation
I use my last breath, to reach the whole nation
How can they call me murderer for my spoken words?
This composition is my prophecy, I hope it's heard

[Interlude: 2Pac]
How can y'all call us murderers and shit and
Blame all the problems of the world on us young dumb, Thug Niggas from the streets, ain't that a bitch
Tell me y'all ain't giving a fuck about us when we was broke and poor
How come when we get a little money, motherfuckers wanna stop us and block us
What part of the game is that?
Who should we love, who should we believe in when the motherfuckers that's supposed to be our role models, supposed to be the people we look up to is tryna snatch us out of the game
What type of shit is that?
Fuck 'em all

[Verse 4: Kastro]
I still whizz for the top Dollar
Just a true thug [?] a comer
High power, small timer, made nigga top [?]
With mean ways to play 'em these days, homie I'm saying though they tryna play me, so I gots to get them, hit 'em and lay low
I told you before, my only fear of death
Is momma crying for help, and papa tryin' to help
When I know we ain't got it, but shit I gots to handle this card
They hand it to me, snitches, trick bitches, niggas who ain't us enemy
Never worry, apparently, I think I never buried
But if so, I gotta go my nigga's will always love me
Thug family ties, I know they want me to die
But I'ma survive, see the look in my eyes

[Outro: Lemika]
And this Lemika and I'd like to give a shout out to all the tray-whizz kids out and I'm appreciating how I'm chilling up in the studio with 2Pac and Cocoa G and uh -laughs- okay I'm out..
I'm done, I went out, oh shit, put this back
