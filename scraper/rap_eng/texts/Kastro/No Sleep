[Intro: keepitinside]
It's been a long, long day
Baby, are you something to me?
’Cause I can't sleep
You shouldn't go
You shouldn’t go

[Chorus: keepitinside]
No sleep
I've been waiting on you
Every night I've been wishing
Getting myself through
Holding onto something
My pillows are breaking
I don't want to sleep
No I don't want no sleep
I've been waiting on you
Every night I've been wishing
Getting myself through
Holding onto something
Our pillows are breaking
I don't want to sleep
No I don’t want no sleep

[Verse 1: zamir]
I’m losing slumber
Yes I've become an insomniac
I’ve been calling your number
I understand you won't call me back
But this thunderous silence
This violent storm in my brain
That forms that even the thought of you
Drives me slowly insane
I've been waiting for so long
For you to return
So now how will I ever move on
How will I learn?
With all these memories so strong
Stupidly yearning
That's why I wrote you this whole song
Wish you could’ve heard it, I

I, I really miss you
I really miss the way that life with you was really simple
I really wish the day had never come when you had left
Now I'm staring at my ceiling as I ponder and reflect
Burying my feelings trying to conquer my regrets
But it's useless
All the words that I had never said
I was stupid
And now I'm spending every single night sleepless
Holding onto any hope or thought of your return

[Verse 2: keepitinside]
Something tells me I'm doing this wrong
Everyday another memory, a verse in a song
Hope to god they don't see me cry
'Cause I've been keeping it together since she came to life
Now I'm holding onto something that I can't control
A walk in the partially unfunctional
Think about a place I can't believe
'Cause everything is better in a fucking dream, I

Think I'll stay awake right now
Counting every hole in my life, somehow
Fill it all up with S-A-D
You aren't the only thing that's missing in me
I'll find my heel
Spin the wheel
Spend time feeling
Guess that I'm not sleeping

[Chorus: keepitinside]
No sleep
I've been waiting on you
Every night I've been wishing
Getting myself through
Holding onto something
My pillows are breaking
I don't want to sleep
No I don't want no sleep
I've been waiting on you
Every night I've been wishing
Getting myself through
Holding onto something
Our pillows are breaking
I don't want to sleep
No I don't want no sleep
