[Intro: 2Pac]
As the world turns…
As the world turns my niggas grow and grow and grow
And get dough and roll and ride
Niggas die and mommas cry
Niggas got alibis and suicides and homicides
And three strikes and yo' life and my life and times change
And niggas fame, as the world turns…

[Verse 1: 2Pac]
Though I walk through the valley of Hell the shadow follows me. Wisdom hard to swallow tomorrow, expect apologies
You probably panic, stranded in search of a better planet
Realism hard to understand, we stand slanted
And still stranded. Merciless thieves stole the best of me
I pray to black Jesus to please take the rest of me
And still, the best of us build and reach monetary gains
Some of us kill, but still, most of us can change
If we search deeper
God bless the hustler, curse the first sleeper
Enemies get beside me, flows go deep as Poseidon
When we ride, plots keep all my enemies blinded
Time will soon show, a thought can last for years
Outshinin' your fake smiles, plastic tears
Like last year, niggas stuck in the past, and it's clear
Just some busta ass bastards allergic to cash this year
Makaveli for the mob, M.O.B
Killin' busters is my motherfuckin' job, him or me
Lyrically fatally driven, niggas reported missin'
My competition dead or in prison, as the world turns…

[Hook: (Darryl 'Big D' Harper) & 2Pac]
Turns, turns, turns, turns and turns
My niggas grow and grow and grow
(As The World Turns)
Gettin' dough and dough and dough
From this state to that state
From this cell to that cell, (As the world turns)

[Verse 2: Kastro & (2Pac)]
Ain't no frontin' me I see my fucking soul, right in front of me
Yo Pac Cover Me, I'm in this thang for the luxury
Wassup with me I'm fuckin' chilling, Dreams of millions (Ya moms in this Bitch)
Time to keep my green buildings, maintained with no fillings
For these weak motherfuckers, my heat street suckers (Weak ass tricks)
New street geek plucka', a long wrap without a rubba'
Listen to my Bompton, Outlaw blast the Compton, Gettin' half in pumpin (Jersey in this bitch)
I cluck the razor slap it chocolate, Hey Now
Got a lotta G's on the way now, Marcy and paydown
My niggas blownin' up, getting paid now

[Verse 3: Hussein Fatal]
Precision in my favors, unanimous decision
Fuck a religion dead on collision with the walls of prison
A street mercenary, lieutenant penned it
Move it down like Emmett, only five minutes in it
Got my town extended, Sadam Hussan
A Big San, San Wan, I'm the first the bomb
Dear Mama I disrespected ways to your vagina
Household de-ca, when the cops was behind ya'
Some niggas got crippled, money still gettin' tripled
Suckers'll stick you, I keep my hands on the pistol
It's drastic, niggas'll set you up for the casket
Fake teardrops, real closed casket they got it mastered
Unprofessionally, I crawl with aggressional
Thoughts me and my gats, climbs apps like a sexual
For this pain and agony, I feel allegated gravity
And my heart hurt, like I got voodoo pins stabbin' me
(Ooh, shit)

[Pre-Hook: 2Pac]
Rest in Peace Soldier (Rest in Peace Soldier)
Haha

[Hook: Darryl 'Big D' Harper & (2Pac)]
As The World Turns
(And my niggas roll by, hahaha)
As The World Turns
(Niggas get a swoll eye, and it don't stop and it don't quit
That real shit!)
As The World Turns
(Niggas die for this, How many you niggas try to this?)
As The World Turns
(Murderin' methods.. haha, OUTLAW!)

[Verse 4: E.D.I. Amin]
Only haters caught feelings when my homie caught millions
And acquired the desired status of boss livin'
We cross driven, cornered into a life that's hellish
Payin' our dues with bloodshed, ain't shit y'all could tell us
Fellas – mount up, it's time for battle, it's on now
Two worlds collidin', armies ridin', soldiers born wild
Sometimes I think my glory days was back in my youth
I sought too for family, but I got it lost in these ounces
Now, as the world turns court adjourns, I'm sentenced to burn
The cost of my sins too much, nothin' left to earn

[Verse 5: Kadafi]
October 9th 1977 first day out my baby carriage
Married my MAC-11 hit the block playin'
Only five years up in this bitch, papa runnin' from the feds
Puttin' peanut butter on the walls to hide his prints
Me on my own, not yet grown, but only man of the home
To protect my zone in these streets I roam
Dough on d-low, downin' straight shots of Cristal Brothers
100 dollar snot box on cee-lo, fuck eighth
I need a kilo, got a plot, move my block down state
Got the drop on the spot, movin' pounds of weight
Fuck my fate and lots of loot to burn, a hustler's yearn
For this dirty money earned as this crooked world turns

[Outro: 2Pac]
Aye-yo! (As The World Turns)
Which one of y'all niggas out there gettin' money out there
Who gettin' money, REAL G's nigga!
Fuck that lil' five hundred ten dollar shit that lil' hundred dollar shit
I'm talkin' bout brand new creep
BLACK JESUS, I know he sees and only he can feed us
I believe you, you believe us
Only leaders no followers
All these niggas tryna' get his advice but they swallow us WHOLE
I take yo' soul nigga lost CONTROL, is ya' bad and BOLD?
(Haha), my .44 GO, Four-Four, and they drop
When a nigga picture all you using a cop (Haha)
Anybody that try to stop me take me off this planet I can't STAND you trick ass niggas if you try to ban this here
Have no fear The Outlawz have come nigga disappear when we run (Bitch ass)
When we come when we ride
Suicides and homicides is what we supply
Niggas die don't cry now (As The World Turns)
You Die Now (Outlaw Riders)
What you found, niggas from the pound, three fifty-seven, all the way to heaven (Haha)
My MAC-11 keep these niggas breathin', who do you believe in?
Only he can see us, BLACK JESUS
Haha, Yes, YES, As The World Turns (As The World Turns)
Tha Outlawz, Ghetto Stars, Makaveli The Don, YES
Death Row, Haha
Death Row gave birth to a New Seed, Makaveli Records
Feel Me Now, YEAH (Especially With Mobb Deep)
No doubt, Lil' Napoleon is this Bi-yatch
With a big ass four-five bigger than him (Haha)
Niggas don't want it (Outlawz Nigga)
WESTSIDE, Nigga, We got Jersey
We got the Bay to LA, Best Side
Westside (Y'all know what time it is)
When you close your eyes and wake up in the morning
I'll be there to bless you
