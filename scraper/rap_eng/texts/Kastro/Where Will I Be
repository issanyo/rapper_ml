[Verse 1: Yaki Kadafi]
As I think back to what the whipper's on the rear was for
And take look at all my niggas who ain't here no more and all that
Wheelin' and dealin'
Ain't lookin' appealin'
Cause now I got a funny feelin' for a million
And hey around my way Young Thugz stay strapped
With extra ammo on they motherfuckin' back's
And crack to sell
Can't go back to jail
Pack tail and help this young nigga stack some mail
And crime's in the New York Times ain't gettin' better
And Lord knows this shit won't last forever
These days for the cream and thing's
Kids will black out
Some cracked out hit the pen max out
Come home and blow a back out
Cause life's a task
Tryin' to earn some cash without that burnin' mass and still I ask

[EDI aka Big Malcolm talking:]
Where will I be this time next year
Will I survive or die
Yo will I still be here

[Hook: 2Pac and Young Thugz]
Success, draped in riches havin' sex with the baddest bitches
(But I was only 17 young thug wantin' cream and thing's)
(My homie couldn't help but dream of fame and still I wonder)
Where will I be this time next year
Will I survive or die
Yo will I still be here
(Thinkin' about, Success, draped in riches havin' sex with the baddest
Bitches)
But I was only 17 young thug wantin' cream and thing's
My homie couldn't help but dream of fame

[Verse 2: Kastro aka K-Dogg]
All I see is
Crack feind's and drug dealer's
And cops will stop beam scheme's and chrome wheeler's
When will these
Motherfucker's really feel us
Maybe if we illed out and turned into killer's
I dream that
One day i'll be rich and be on every bitch and
Jealous niggas hit list
I see you comin' and I ain't runnin'
It's way too late
And if I got to die young then it's just my fate
I be a thug nigga
The same time around next year (Thug life)
No lie, if I cry then it be tek tears
'97 probably be hell of heaven for a nigga like me
But I'mma keep bailin' there ain't no tellin' where your homie will be
And it ain't just only me
But all the niggas that I run with
Stackin' figger's smackin' niggas and havin' fun it's dumb
(Why?)
Cause in a flash my ass can be a goner
So I'mma puff blunts and get drunk when the fuck I wanna
And I wonder
Where will I be next year

[Verse 3: 2Pac]
I be fucked up and weeded
No introduction needed
Get your hoochie hot enough to eat it
As I proceed to kick the G shit
I'm buckin' foe's
And duckin' hoes
Suppose that then can catch me off fuckin' toes
And even though I'm still high
I'm thuggin' till I die
Never let these bitches catch me with my eye's closed
Got bullet holes in my buildin'
Seen the death of many children
Between us them niggas killed them
All these stressful ass memories
All I can see is all the homie's that I witnessed bleed
It's is killin' me

So what?
What?
So?
