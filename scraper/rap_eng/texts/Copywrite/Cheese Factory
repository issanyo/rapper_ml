[Verse One: Mr. Eon]
It was flipboard 20's, I'mma clown on the pounds
Spitting about Bentley's I'mma walk around town

[Copywrite]
And I'm focused man
Provoke this man
You get ran over in your own promotions van

[Mr. Eon]
I be rockin' high tops, lace to my hamstrings
And if E's a devil, let me do that damn thing

[Copywrite]
And to all you MC's light in the ass, just stop illin'
I'm already about to Milk this shit, we Top Billin'

[Mr. Eon]
Watch me Talk Like Sex to celebs that pour Cris'
And then ask Will Smith for a Jada kiss

[Copywrite]
And you miss losers tricking, meet me in V.I.P
On some R. Kelly shit, I don't need to see I.D
Give me the light, pass the 'dro
Brought the semi tonight
In case any one of you want to fight, we blast you hoes
Taking cash
We'll take it fast and watch yourself
Like you in the mirror and you 'bout to watch yourself

[Hook: Mr. Eon] {x2}
Shit on the airways sound funny to me
A hundred MC's, all fronting and they running for cheese
Catch them at they shows, they ducking MC's
You ain't real, you're what your label wants you to be

[Verse Two: Copywrite]
Checkmates with Pete, keep stalling you lost your look
Streets keep calling but can't get through, I'm off the hook
And every noon I wake up to six phillies and three dimes, never early
If I ain't high by 4:20 I'm 7-30

[Mr. Eon]
I got a hummer in a Hummer, was the best I made
It Benz over Mercedes, now it Escalade
With all this pussy around me man I can't lock it up
In Da Club, only 50 Cent in my pocket

[Copywrite]
Still hoes see me and they stop
When I walk around the block
Cause my watch gives new meaning to the phrase rock around the clock
Watch us bang this heat out
Coincidentally my heat rang
The street I'm facing penalties for the brain to leak out
High on three dimes and green trees, y'all felines fight
But never seen cheese like Three Blind Mice
And I'm hated by so many my foes got foes
Fucking shrimp, such a pimp, my fucking hoes got hoes

[Hook]

[Verse Three: Mr. Eon]
I be cutting up that [?] to stop awhile
Before you hear Mr. Eon rhyme like Chopper's style
Dope or not, now there's still a hung jury
But man I'm high enough and I'm buzz worthy

[Copywrite]
In [?] trunk I got a pump and a dollar
So when I say I'm kicking a willy, holla
We're jumping a baller
And this ring don't fit dawg, got something that's smaller?
Fuck it, my boy got a Pit, I'll put it up in his collar

[Mr. Eon]
The LP release date got me hardly ringing
Take a big shit uptown, I'll have Harlem Shaking
She got open toes, fuck hoes, I throw those
Shooting in her face I make 'em look at [?]
High & Mighty won't do that thing
High & Mighty won't do that thing
Copy now go

[Copywrite]
Copywrite won't do that thing
Copywrite won't do that thing

[Hook]
