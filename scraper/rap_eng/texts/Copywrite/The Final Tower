[Verse One] [Copywrite]:
Listen you Stan
Get a clue, you're a visible fan
In the booth, battlin' the Invisible Man
It's supposed to be me inspirin' that verse
You'll need a church, choir and a hearse
I'll have your fake buddies dialin' the nurse
Pete's so Nice I'm retirin' with Search
Hawking that jazz will put you Miles in the dirt
When I retire from the Earth
I'll come back like Christ
For no other reason, other than I want back my life
I can bullshit a round
Make a classic, get my ass kicked
Let the proof get around
I'm still the cool kid in town
I embrace all flaws, that chainsaw gnawed your face off raw
Nic Cage take your Face Off (aaww)
At my own shows I chase off broads
Give 'em a head start
Chase 'em, catch 'em and rape raw dog
Can't escape, awe nah
Gave her an hour to travel
Now we reenact the second bar from Tower Of Babel
Can't win with words, I'll give you an hour at Scrabble
Don't have the power to baffle
Me? I devour the alpha
Bet the tower of ice
You cowards are trife
Wait till class out to spazz out
I'm Screetch Powers in high school
I leap towers right by you within a single bound
Faster than a speeding bullet hit the charts without a single out
Hit your heart like when you're singled out
And you least expect to meet the best chick who she said it's yeast infected
It's heat seekin', there's no point in seekin' exits
But since it seeks heat, it reaches me, direct hit
Dumb ho, here's a ticket to the gun show
Front row, hearin' crickets at your one show
This is Copywrite, Marv Won mixin' up the drugs though
What up though?
Pen, Dom, uh ohhhhhhhh

[Verse Two] [Motion Man]:
My shit is Will Smith Legend on turf
Goons send 'em, kill my own dog if he gets infected with venom
I'm abuse fit for all the dog lovers
Rehabilitate me I'll snap back and pull the plug out your mother
I'm like a flying saucer or some seen
Strong arm and walk up on you, size up on you, strip you down for them jeans
What I mean is, I'm your lyrical particle
Without my influence no magazines no news articles
You marginal
Dedicated to medicated
Uneducated
Hella connected, motherfuckers is black black black

[King.dom]:
All you motherfuckers stuck at work
Puffin' a dutch full of purp'
Couple perks
Little bit of Indian, scribblin' me another verse
The kids spittin' the sickest livin' on fuckin' Earth
So every beat is gettin' killed/kilt like Cudi's skirt
Lot of skeet is gettin' spilled (where?)
Your mother's shirt
I get it poppin' and droppin' her at the fuckin' church
Brain's great but y'all lame's gon' hate
The weakest link but the motherfuckin' chain is fake
Your weed stinks
Y'all need to change your pace
I hang with an 8th
A blunt will rearrange your face
Pssst
Sky's the limit, I'mma aim for space
Got haze in the safe
Stop playin' you payin', I'mma stay in the place
Stop lyin'
Dom's tryin' to see more
I'm cookin' up like the pilot on a G4
Hookin' up with the dime at the weed store
Three whores delivering my dope, no detour
These whores ain't stoppin' for no cops fam
I tell 'em "Fuck The Police" like Roxanne
They blow till they nose bleed, I got grams
Bunch of naked young sluts playin' Rock Band
God damn, I be blowin' a pound
Back on my bullshit like a rodeo clown
I won't quit till I hit every ho in the town
I'm holdin' the crown
Who's holdin' it down?
O-Dot

[Verse Four] [Poison Pen]:
If you can't detect, I'm probably in Brooklyn
Henny on my chest like Prodigy in Shook Ones
Fat drunk, belligerent
Knock out all for dead presidents
Hop out the car, just shots out to ?
That'll resolve it

[Copywrite]:
But you won't grow your limbs back

[Poison Pen]:
Boy you ain't no starfish
I'm a goon that side bet, slash mobster
Side talkin' monster, slash walkin' monument
I'm a biped, rare North American grizzly
Taught how to walk, talk, rap, strap and get busy
Raised by Brooklyn wolves
Step in Brooklyn shoes
(See my best?)
That's the Brooklyn jewel
Bed Stuy, that's the Brooklyn Zoo
And they rock the set where the predators in Brooklyn rule
Zoo keepers, keep clappin' at ?
That fro I rock, homeboy that's my natural skin
I shave my mane to appear more plain
Top of the food chain
Hop in two train
My cohorts with Carhartt's
We blend with our surroundings
Sluts around?
I'm a cat, I'm pouncing and bouncing
Been in it for four years, be in it for more years
Hungover real proper
Posture of Chewbacca
Pen I'm a monster
Go ask your mommas
My balls kill birds like Randy Johnson's
I'm an animal

[Marv Won]:
A lot of people's ask my whereabouts
I've been in the lab
I put my phone down, I'm back to my pen and my pad
Memory lane, I am relivin' my past
I am way better than Mayweather at slippin' jabs
All you bums throwing shots are not gettin' a pass
I'm the shit, rappers are pissed, get 'em a bag
Spewin' hate when they know they prolly love me
The new nigga runnin' Detroit, I'm Rodney Stuckey
And I'm somethin' to see
I'm selfish, I treat bars like pussy, ain't nobody fuckin' with me
You can't fuck with the D
Stop posturin', you're lactose intolerant
You are not accustomed to cheese
Train with the killers, learn from the winners
I will not starve to death, I am earning my dinner
And you lookin' like a steak
Niggas claimin' sharks
Till they floppin' in that boat with them hooks all in they face
You lookin' for a bitch nigga, look another place
I'm good in every hood, by the looks of shit I'm straight
Every word I jot in my book is great
You can keep your wallet man, my crooks go for the safe

[Sample from the motion picture Old School]:
You're crazy man. I like you, but you're crazy
