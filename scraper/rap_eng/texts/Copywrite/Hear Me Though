[Intro]
How we doin' this shit? How's this shit runnin'? Yeah

[Verse One]
You're payin' me to guest appear?
That's like handin' me five Gs to slice you from chest to ear
These veterans here spew sentiments of pain
After I shoot the gift my stage presence/presents will remain
Visions came to you after you picked my brain
If you got creative juices
Then I got the fruit from which they came
Think I'm heartless cause crews get slain
But of course I got a heart
What else could pump this steel through my veins
And C don't aim to please
I aim to kill lame MCs
Point my slang at their brains and squeeze
You bring five fingers of death to cats?
I got one finger to bring you to death in four seconds flat
And you won't last so don't brag
You wanna go toe to toe?
I'm tryin' to go toe to toe tag
So when you hear that chirp sound
Spit my verse clown
That way you can make it 20 seconds through the first round
I stay strep throat from screamin' rated X quotes
Battled the whole Tunnel for doe
Players left broke
So the shit I'm on
You're not remotely on that
And nobody's fuckin' with my crew
Quote me on that

[Hook]
This is theme music so smoke your weed to it
And choke MCs to it
You know how we do it
And to the haters?
I know you feel me though
You hatin' on me but you hear me though
And to my people that's evil
Drinkin' and drivin' illegal
Smokin' and high as an eagle
Bitches I'm tryin' to see you
But to the haters
I know you feel me though
You hatin' on me but you hear me though

[Verse Two]
It's C Dub, chewed up in a rented Benz
I'd speed up but the tank is on E like Eminem
One blunt
The hoes hands right in my pants
Two blunts
And I'm on the opposite side of the road like I'm in France
I spit hate
Fuck that
For each mixtape I bless
Your record release date is pushed a month back
But we can spar sitting, drop 50 bars shittin'
The bathroom or the vocal booth, no large difference
I hit herb smoke
Spit to split nerves open
None of that shit you spit is worth quotin'
Each verse smokin'
78, never fake
Leave you in the middle of nowhere like the letter "H"
Better get it straight
Before I straighten it myself
You a clone
I diss you, I'm hatin' on myself
Copy headed
Like take your slopped edit demo
Document it
Fuck you, fuck him
And tell 'em Copy said it

[Hook]

[Verse Three]
Get your soft crew
So I can clip them off too
My clique can not lose
Got sick shit to drop soon
You picked the wrong dude
Quick to cock tools
Start the beef at 5:58 and make the six o'clock news
I still battle
Dawg, ain't no slaughterin' me
Besides, I don't battle for nothin' short of a G
It's sort of a change
A New World Order in my brain
Waiter, come here
I need a new girl, order some brain
The hottest shit
I creep low with a freak ho
Honest bitch I got a dick that a giraffe couldn't deep throat
You weak though
You're tired clique?
I put 'em six feet
You could empty an entire clip and couldn't hit me
You miss me
What you gettin' done, spittin' dumb?
Usin' bitten shit to battle me
But forgot I'm the one you bit it from
Crunch time with the one ton mind wordsmith
21 rhymes I didn't hear one line worth shit
Fucks your purpose?
All your verses worthless
This is Mhz turf
Get off the Earth you worthless
Tell someone, what I'm spittin' is not flames?
And you're dead wrong like B.I.G. layin' in Pac's grave
For every mill I pull I add a syllable to my flow
That means for now, I'm killin' 'em slow
Stay smashin' cats
I ain't goin' nowhere
I'll be here tomorrow
Day after tomorrow
And the day after that

[Hook]
