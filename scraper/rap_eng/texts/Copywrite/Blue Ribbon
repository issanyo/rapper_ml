[Verse 1: Copywrite]
Without me getting to sentimental, I want to say
Drink my warm piss on ninety degrees summer day
You run away without a modeling agency
God has been praising me
Lately on my songs been amazing me
As Islamic as Asia be
But as Christian as Kanye
Quote scriptures from psalms page
And hit a bitch in the broad day
Underground hereditary, you see me and mom and pops
We don't clear samples, no duty free vodka shots
Bruce B, Scott Le Rock mixed with Bruce Lee, Kookie
Charles Manson, all his grandsons bully D pops and Pac
Weed session, so they both cashed out like a recession
Please bless them, before the seven deadly sins and greed gets them
Probably a little too late, honestly
Copy is a two tape prodigy, you fakes honor me
You take just you wait, watch and see
If you hate modesty, you will love me
You bootleg chopping knees

[Verse 2: Copywrite]
Pick up your bird, we swerve in a rental cruse
I serve her the genital, she bite like its where their originals
I might murder her in the news
You heard of her in the news
They didn't catch the killer
I went back to get her purse
And filled her hearse with cats and litter
Killer verse, is lacking filler
Rap until a lung collapse
I swing him off his fucking axe
Lets kill it back until it crashes into Saturn
My patterns are madder than mothers against drunks
Shattering rims, dunk
Can battle him after we gets up
Oh pardon me, I'm having an out of body experience
My body's out of my body, out in the lobby hearing this
Smoked a dozen times, while you wrote the dime a dozen rhymes
While you headlined and wondered how I poked, a dozen die
King of my city's Kong
While some dummy getting on
Which is as unbelievable as a brand new biggie song
I'm no hoochie, that's plain to see
I'm about as far as G as A-Z
Please for you, watch your P's and Q's
Before I cross your T's, Drop your I's and leave you bruised

[Sample: Methodman]
"He the sharpest motherfucker, and he always on point
Razor sharp, with the rhymes, whatever."

[Verse 3: Copywrite]
Specialize in petty theft, sneak into your treasure chest
Take every cent, but leave a penny left, thieve your NES
You went to drama speak, puffed two tons of chron a week
Sonic heat on the beat, clocking two hundred dollar sneaks
Who wants to beef? I'm packing two kinds of heat
I'm mac-ing two kinds freaks
Bring a napkin to wipe her cheeks
Forty inch cable chain
Hanging swang like orangutang
Save you some fatal pain
Never gaze you will sprain your brain
And move behind me
Doing ninety with brew inside me
Do a high speed chase
If the troopers find me, who's beside me?
Code name C.I.B., loosing you cats
If I'm moving too fast
Please stop me, mock three when I chief broccoli
I'm sparking a dark hash
Nervous with the warrant
Watching Cops, hoping its not my apartment they knock at
You started, ill stop that
With a new Glock, I copped that
Target the pop at
Any cats that wanted they spot back

[Sample: Prodigy]
