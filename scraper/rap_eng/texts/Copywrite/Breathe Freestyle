[Verse]
I radar the best 'dro
So when I'm in your city, put one in the air like you're at a KRS show
Oh, silly fucks, my artillery's up
Spit mean with hotter sixteens than Hillary Duff
Speak a little and watch, speakers sizzle, I'm hot
Releasing heat seeking missiles that'll get you once locked
Hit you from blocks
You'll swear you were bit by a pit or a rott
Bitch you ain't 'Pac, I wouldn't give you the pleasure
Cause there's a 1 in 5 chance you'd live through the terror
And now a days, it's all it take for them to give you the treasure
Crown, robe and a throne with your name engraved
Ain't paid a day of dues but go diamond first tape you made
Yeah, I pop shit but got the bars to back it
I'm sick but it's hard to catch it
I spit like an automatic
But it's just target practice
Need a pacemaker, I'm a heartless bastard
Sip Remy Martin, bring Terror to your Squad, ?? told 'em
Lean Back like Mary Kate Olson
Eat that, you malnutritioned so how you dissin'?
Add a couple of pounds guy, the crown isn't fittin'
Out of town on a mission
Spittin' rap for the figures
Till I'm deeper in the cake than a bachelor's stripper
If it ends tomorrow, fuck a rap song, strap bombs
The black mac, pull it and it's like I'm back on
