My story is untold, but similar to the story...
Getting tested by the devil, where the score is refold?
The glorious oath, the crisis I'm in
No... for my soul
... a war with my,.. but I'm struggling more for the...
Use to think pills more than liquor will fill me with vigor
They're gonna be quicker, they'll fill me with rigor
... for this reason I'm trying to stop
But... still cross my mind a lot
Every time... I seem to find a lot
Does it matter if... is coke or some other kind of pot
I've been to AA meetings drunk
True story, listen the dude's boring!
Nothing they could do for me
My real initial was at the... WM
I left my former cliquers, I had troubles with them
It's just hard to trust people, I'm having trouble again!
See, I even... lack of trust for within
Now what won't kill me, will make me stronger
And ain't dead... for longer
All my life is filled with crazy dramas
So in my after life, please Lord make it common!
Now what won't kill you, will make you stronger
And you ain't dead...
All your life is filled with crazy drama
So in my after life, please Lord make it common
Dude, I was in jail...
In the morning I'll be free from...
I told him he's lucky cause both his dad and momma is living
We've reached God, our own personal hell
Most worse than a cell,..
We're on dirt for ourselves
... return the shells...
Last breath for we fell from sin
... or is it cause none of the creator's patience was left?
I don't ever wanna be in hell with the fragrance of flesh
Burning... while my... was left
Christians, Muslims,..
Well, from what we know
Mohamed and Jesus were distant cousins
You know how many people gonna judge me?
You know how many matter only the...
My life... to continue till the Judgment Day
Now what won't kill me, will make me stronger
And ain't dead... for longer
All my life is filled with crazy dramas
So in my after life, please Lord make it common!
Now what won't kill you, will make you stronger
And you ain't dead...
All your life is filled with crazy drama
So in my after life, please Lord make it common!
Story of my life, no one to read it to me
It's like I found the tree of life, nobody defeated to me
Popular, no!
So people wanna talk on the phone
Send them the voice mail, I'm alone, I'm walking alone!
Don't you call me after night and disappear...
I just wanna be left alone, isn't that clear to you?
... off track, I'm off that, and getting back on
I'm a broken record, keeping fighting, hiding tracks on!
Boasted in a confession... all the evil deeds I did
Back in the human middle
Man, please forgive my sins!
Nobody stops,.. even at my autopsy
I'll be looking down, laughing from Heaven
Cause God's got me!
Never...
First to last words, any... hurts
Gonna be that way to a black curse
Carries me away to a...
And berries me in a grave that says that my first name lasted...
Now what won't kill me, will make me stronger
And ain't dead... for longer
All my life is filled with crazy dramas
So in my after life, please Lord make it common!
Now what won't kill you, will make you stronger
And you ain't dead...
All your life is filled with crazy drama
So in my after life, please Lord make it common!
