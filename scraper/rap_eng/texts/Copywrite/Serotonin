[Verse 1]
I don't know how to start this verse
I'm at a loss for words. First
Let me apologize to all persons I crossed and hurt
See Karma’s a bitch and I got what I deserve
God'll work in that way to show you tomorrow you’re not promised Earth
(Sometimes I feel) I feel like I wasted away my years
I swear other times it feels amazing to have made it here
That's way sincere
Listen, I’ve had a crazy year
Which made me fear
Nothing living
It's a cold world; we’re not born with earmuffs and mittens
Get your weird drugs and sniff ‘em
But share something with ‘em
Kids at school, shirts say D.A.R.E. but they’re puffin’ ism
Don't know where to go
Swear I've been around the world, feel like nowhere’s home
Think I’m arrogant? That's hysterical
I've been there before, but that's years ago
But I swear my oath not to be that Pete
At least that's the goal
So can I please have back control?
Hip-Hop Dubstep slash rap n' roll
Dyed my hair jet black to match my soul
I'm living in the moment
Care to join me?
We’re holdin’ a ceremony
Smile for me with your last bit of serotonin

[Verse 2]
(Focus your mind)
I need closed lids now
(Open your eyes)
Hocus Pocus, disappear
If he disses me first
He might go get to the hearse
All of this isht is reversed
Off a cliff in the dirt
Without ends I just merc ‘em
Certain it’s curtains
Once I hear the uncensored version
You’re a tenth the person
I spurt the burnt nurse who birthed him
But I’ll feet-first reverse ‘em
Heard peace words
Yeah, we search to learn ‘em
And it’s deeper to know Pete first in person
Now with that said (I said)
Now with that spoken
I gotta have a good halo
Guess like an angel from the past
Cut ‘em back
I said my problem is
I’ve seen too much
Your problem is
You haven’t seen enough
If we could somehow even up
To teach us what we need to cut
We’d be somewhat between half-decent
Just a touch past teething cups
But I got The Lox Publishing
That’s mad green to puff
But I gotta stop puffin’ it (Why?)
I’ve got a broken condom
You help me now, maybe later I’ll let my dirt get on you
