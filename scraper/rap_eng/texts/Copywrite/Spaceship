[Hook: Camu Tao]
You don't know how to drive a spaceship
You don't know how to fly a car
You don't know how to drive a spaceship
You don't know how to fly your car

[Verse 1: Camu Tao]
What's you peoples on?
Get your people going shuffle
Giving a vortex, why you lying again?
Spitting shit stupid, you trying again
Whose bones you trying to bend?
Extra large shit, super shit, what's your name kid, son
What your game is, what your fame...

Come in the bitches' hair then she runs in the house
You don't know what the daily letter is?
It’s sewed on your cardigan sweater kid
We’re like a bunch of odor eaters
A bunch of overachievers
A bunch of old cheaters
A bunch of old niggas with salone(?) penis
You got a cup with your name on it
You got a ecko shirt with a shit stain on it
You put a five on it, put a pain on it
We bopped the dick and put your d-d-d-d-dame on it
Get on it

[Hook: Camu Tao]
You don't know how to drive a spaceship
You don't know how to fly a car
You don't know how to drive a spaceship
You don't know how to fly a car
You put a five on it, put a pain on it
You put a five on it, put a pain on it
You put a five on it, put a pain on it
You put a five on it, put a pain on it

[Verse 2: Danny Brown]
Check!
Rolling off the ecstasy
Fucking with a raver chick
Wave the dick in front of her face like it's a glowstick
With drugs I do aerobic
You stretch it, then work out
My dick begging her serving, she still be tryna make-out
Way out my body, out to southern(?) Vegas
Like to drink beer with mashed potatoes
Round like Retinobel(?)...

If you don't get back, Dan Bro, you are lame
Fucking hoes like my dick made of polyurethane
Poly then a different lane, they wanna merge over
Tell your bitch respeco...
Used to whip the soda her, go like... soda
Getting money gonna be like...
Tell her I feel alone cause I fucked up the...
And started Bruiser Brigade, now a nigga can...

[Verse 3: Copywrite]
Dear diarrhea, I have severe diarrhea
Going on any MC that I hear by a speaka
On a beer diet, nearsighted
Come and get here, buy a Tyson on the Mike so your ear bite it
MXC, put the C-O on the M-A-P, G
A lot of them wack, but them ain't we
C-E, then when Dom down I'm still hard than the SATs
It sound crisp when Pete slurring
You put the eaturing in featuring
Rocka buy your song that go to sleep during
Copyright the rhyme so it don't eat words and
I write a jam determing
It come so easy
I don't plan to word it
In the back of the limo I got a man with bourbon
Fraud on the beat, now I'm all over the web
Spiderman's detergent
