[Verse 1]
Ladies and gentlemen, you ain't gotta stay in your element
My staff chuckles while brass knuckles scraping your melanin
You claiming it was an accident, pay me a settlement
You saying you wasn't having it, I gave it, you yelling, "Quit!"
Oh, it's on the low though? I stuff cigars with stuff from jars
Above the stars, M.P., they ain't heard drums this hard
I shoot my load ten feet and they asking if I ever thought I'd come this far
Look, I knew I'd do it, the question is who was stupid to mess with this
Who was losing a second, this music scooped and the weapon is
To his crew and the message is, "Don't push me"
You're so pussy that you're oozing with estrogen
Straightjacket tightened by my psycho ward
And he straight up forgot to lace up my Michael Jordans
I don't write no chorus, my alterego writes those for us
Fuck a tree dog, I light whole forests
I've got the flows to toast most approachers
And got the toes so foes don't approach us
Nah, Jakki brought the shotty and a case, check it
Liquor'll make em drop Shells quicker than J Records
And the crowd's mine, I'll out-rhyme your hood
I'm outside with about nine guys, it's good
While you peasants crowd by my foot to rhyme when I’m done
But that's saying they're trying to get outshined like Suge
Look, you pussies either roll eight or one
Trying to jump me but still can't, they hate on son
They'll get their money jacked, see me in the span of a few years
Do shit till they see me off Jack, Patron, and a few beers
Mixture of Big L, Big Pun, and Biggie
With an attitude like Jigga so if you come and get me
Bring eight people, a spiked bat and a gun to clip me
And if I got you for money wait until I'm drunk to hit me, pussy
Matter fact, you ain't even a pussy
You're what bleeds when the summer's eve cleaning the pussy
C.O.P. you freestyle to see no fee
I am the C.O. bringing it to you COD
Cash on delivery, and no one can do it better, shit
I'm the D-O-C with OCD, spit heat like a Creole feast
That's why they be on Pete's dick to the point I don't see my own feet

[Hook]
I can introduce you to your maker
You got a problem with me homeboy, step to me
Strap you down and slap you ‘round
Yeah I said it

[Verse 2]
Star sprinter, run any track flash above par [Barlinder]
Blow sniffer, jacking coke like a bartender
Punchlines till your bar's tender so celebs cars enter
And we're shooting stars like Haley's Comet denting car fenders
My car's bouncing, got hydraulics and metal toys
Yours ride’s mind's playing tricks like the Geto Boys
Why am I lying? I ain't got the car and I'm unemployed
My rent's due in a day and on it I don't have but a coin
No pot to piss in or to cop a squat and drop my shit in
Radio off so I can listen to my couch petition
Alka Seltzer plop and fizzing from vodka sipping
Waking up with a naked slut and my boxers missing
Hip hop is getting out of control
Every coward that flows is a gangster till the powder's out of his nose
Man in '95 I thought music was losing its touch
Compared to now that was a golden era, who would've thunk?
Now this shit is full of gimmicks, energy, cynics, and critics
Who hate one minute then the next want finish your sentence
This fake game makes we want to take names
With the chrome in hand and take aim like I own this, man
[?]
But I'm not trying to spend life beneath dirt
Or with Shyne and C-Murder
I grind til each word's in the mind of each person populating earth
Cop the tape and stop the hating jerk

[Hook]
