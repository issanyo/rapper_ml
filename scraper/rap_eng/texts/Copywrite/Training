Uh.. Lets go!

Hook:
I said there's no time to sit around, I dont give a shit about
What you're considered now, there's no way to figure out...
Blood, sweat, spillin' out, love, hate, in & out
Love that feelin now, Notion original

Excuse me please, now what were you expectin'?
An instant fan, when i grabbed your attention
So, we lacin' weapons in this session to kill
The way we reppin', don't give us a second to chill… (its real)

Verse:
(wat up yall?), they call me Nosh dog, maybe because the flows cold
I even get bitches panties wet, from a phone call
"Nosh" im the man of the moment, while you standin there dormant
& realisin' that you got no supporters, you a "joke"
(Pfft..) shit.., man, do you seein what im coping wit
On my Kid Cudi Day n Nite, lonely stoner shit
(zone quick,) catch me wit a chick, watchin' porno flicks
Rod stiff as a log, dog, chickies adore the dick
New comers, overlook it, try the play the rules
Get me in they trainin' dude &, let me explain it to em
I'm so potent, & still so focused
Put my time in, & now i startin' chargin' for my dopeness
Give a fuck what ya spit about, provide shit to think about
Im the new era, of this Hip Hop digi-tal
I beg ya fine pardon, listen up clear
Emcees fear, coz real artists rockin' this year, & there's.. (16)

Verse 2:
As soon as I launch off, you pussies get all soft
You ignorance cause y'all, to dwindle & fall off, coz dog
We the illest spit, wit pure magnificence
You sure lack vision kid, you failure to listen is
The reason that you fallin' behind
We cryin' sweatin', bleedin' every season we blowin' ya mind
& still marchin in time, & kill for scrilla at the drop of a dime
If im dropping a roach, that'll be the only way im dropping a dime, (8)
But this a gem, written down with poisonous pens
The how-to training', composin' like Thelonious man..,
I ain't goin for broke, i got my eyes on the bonuses man
Y'all, know what it is, I know the price, but im hopin to bid
Uh, we got this rap game open as shit
So far back, her ribs are cracked, this bitch doin the splits
Okay, victory dance, doggie blaze the L
Copy & I headed for Plat Plus, like we Kane & L, this is training'…

Verse 3 - Copywrite:
The bigger the budget, the wacker the rapper
I know magic, I'll have your cadaba, go abracadabra
Rabbit out the hat trick, I meant, trick out the rabbit
No gas in the Volkswagen, go, gift-mount for cabbage
Only spitter alive's, when they give him a 5
In Source, he's written in twice, saying it was a bribe, (of course)
Draw before you eyes, play Pictionary
Real my skill to zero beneficiary, reload get the clip & hurry
Drop Ohio bars, at CO Penitentiary, life sentences with the chance of ..??
30 seconds I murder em, 30 seconds into the words on the second ad-lib track
Before I spit the sentence, get a reverend pass those back
Gesundheit this a blessing, this the section where I lift the sweatshirt & you glimpse the weapon
Bookin', sweeten', textin' your next of kin 'fo you get to steppin'
I'll axe your skin like a Mexican with a scissored weapon
