The Get Busy Commitee

[Verse 1]
I had to take a hiatus from chiefing
Dilated eyes can't even see
But they're all that I got
Take it or leave em, I need em
Wake and bake in the evening
I don't even
Take a break when I'm sleeping
I blaze an eighth when I'm eating
Its the point I kept on, till it was on point
Anoint thy Teflow
With this song he's all taking it back, basically fact
The point, my best song; I couldn't say
My Day cause like Tommy Chong taking a nap
That joint got slept on
And since Port Authority dropped
Fans wanted more of the Cop
And Marco collabo, sure to be hot
Morbidly obese is how I roll a quarter of pot
Or was it more that I bought
I don't know, I sorta forgot
Its no folklore myth
I used to smoke more spliffs
And choke more until my throats sore
Then I roll more stick-y ick-y
I smoke biggie, ya'll wit me, now smoke wit me
A fifty, i'll throw nifty, now get me a four phillys
I smoke like Redman, broke by headband, soaked like bedpan
Oh my dread man, broke like Stedman
Best ever, walking this exit
Weed got me talking dyslexic like..

Hook:
Uh huh Uh huh this where the chorus would go
But I dont even have more of the dro
So I'm not writing one
Huh, This where the chorus should go
But I dont even have more of the dro
So I'm not writing one
And uh, who cares if you don't like it son
Eh Eh Eh Eh Eh Eh
No Chorus
No Chorus
No Chorus
No Chorus
No [?]

[Verse 2]
Burning the kush
Had my brain turning to mush
I'm like God speaking to Moses
Burning the bush
Read Big's biography and it was nice, however
When I read it backwards I liked it better
(He came back to life)
Big Pun, Biggie and Big L wish they never took big Ls
And were still well
So in memory of them I light a big L
Billboard charts, The Voice turns hearts of joy
Dark and void, till they get depressed
Play themselves and drop pills like Arkanoid
Can't rip apart the boy, once I start the noise
If you can't beat em, join em, but its hard to join
I write months of rhymes, ya'll might want some lines
Ya'll like bees, bite once and die
My freestyle spread quicker than rumors
Liquor consumers, never hung over, a blunt roller
Ya'll sicker than tumors
And I like that seventies dro
This bong make me sit com like that 70s show, ya know

[Hook]
Um I dont have any more the weed so I'm not doing a hook
So sue me
I'm not doing a hook
I'm not doing a hook
I'm not doing a hook
I'm not doing one
I just did a hook actually, this is the hook, Marco check it
Thats the hook, see right now, this is the hook

[Verse 3]
If you party I probably party harder
Sorry the garbage you polly prolly
Gives you a worse buzz than an Army bar
And put em in a weed spot, [?]
And hand me the fifth, least not of brandy
Please stop handing me it
I spilt soda, the coke was on me
I broke the bomb weed and smoked with Sean P
Spit sixteens and whats rapping the hot stuff
Be on molly like "whats hotter than hot stuff"
I jack your man for a half a gram
I'll teach you how to stunt like Jackie Chan
I'm freaking out a blunt with hash in hand
In front of cops like in Amsterdam
