We're wild like broke Rawandan Africans who hate crackers
Ya'll are two fag leftover open condom packages - the gay rappers
You leasin' Bentleys doesn't in the least impress me
You ballin' but you straight coochie - lisa lesie
(uh)
Pete's a beast no need to test me, a god
I was walking on water when mother-effers thought they ain't see the jet skies
So remove me from the remix
Cause dead or alive i'm top five like a movie number prefix
Groupies wanna see this so the roofies and the tea mix
Cut my ex off cause she poopied on my penis
Got a OZ to blaze up back at home
I'm Hurricane Katrina, I blow trees and break up happy homes
I, break up with a-cups who may cut [?]
Crack it no
If not I'll get twat back at home
Got a one man army it's me, no army fatigues
Schizophrenic squad of MCs swallowing E
You go to the Goodwill to window shop cause you're poor
But like mall security Imma cop from the store
Leave the place with a [?] just for kicks
You don't buy a fucking thing you go just for kicks
Been rocking Nike Airs on my feet
Since Will Smith was singing Nightmare On My Street
Like yeah I like these
Fight fair, I might tear your white tee
Pull out a hand grenade while you stand amazed right there beside me
You'll be still awake but unable to feel your face
Put you fags in an all white cast like will and grace
Rehabilitate? No one sold me nothing
You can blame CVS I'm on Robitussin
While you and your broke friends keep going through coke binges
Till your wallets and pockets infinity, no ends
