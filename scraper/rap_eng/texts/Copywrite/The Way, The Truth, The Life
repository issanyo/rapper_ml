[Verse 1: Copywrite]
My penmanship has elevated from Genesis to Revelation
Exodus from hellish places, from faith in the Heavens
Sacred weapon excavated
Cut the grass with the breaths it’s taken
A sinner from the inner depths creation, under reformation
Could never earn the debt we’re paying, what a dumb thought
We’re blood bought by Him, every red cent was traded
Can I get an Amen
He was the payment for our sin
So we could avoid an eternal arson
Marched in like a G
I mean an OG
I mean the son of the living G.O.D
I’m a filthy sinner saved by Jesus's grace
Hoping to eat a healthy dinner and see Jesus's face
No pun intended, I’m not holier than thou
I’m filled with sin, wasn’t even holy as a child
But my Heavenly Father wanted to mold me in a style
Similar to His only Son, and hold me in the clouds
So what’s good homie, GOD is it
Because I had a sentence over my head like a comic strip
Then I had repentance
Chose to be dead, then chose to be resurrected
Pure perfection, I ain’t supposed to be blessed

[Chorus]
He never will suffer defeat
He’s the Truth, and the Life, and the Way
So even when He died, they never took His life but He gave His life away
He never will suffer defeat
He’s the Truth, and the Life, and the Way
So even when He died, they never took His life but He gave His life away
So even when He died, they never took His life but He gave His life away
So even when He died, they never took His life but He gave His life away
He never will suffer defeat
He’s the Truth, and the Life, and the Way
So even when He died, they never took His life but He gave His life away

[Verse 2]
I’m in my late 20’s, still a youngin in light
As a child I was saved, had the Son in my sight
Though I’d memorize verses of the scripture
It was to please pops, the pastor
An imperfect picture
He’d talk in tongues, I’d laugh
Chalk him up as nuts
Got cocky and asked questions trying to catch him up
Figured science held the answer, went to public school
Got programmed to believe the belief in GOD’s for fools
The truth is, for years that’s the way it was in life
The darker things became, the more I strayed from Christ
Then I woke up hopeless, and alone, and remembered
I cried, and with a breath you filled the void of an empty vessel
And now I thank you for all the time you’ve given us
You gave your life so sinners can find forgiveness
There’s only one way to GOD’s kingdom, His path
So get ready, because the signs say He’s coming back

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
So this is it, are you seeing it right
If you are then you know you got a reason to fight
And if you need to know the meaning of life, it’s easy
Ask any real believer in Christ
Look, it’s been a long time coming and we’re getting close
I feel sorry for the people thinking it’s a joke
It’s almost too late to try to say you didn’t know
So you better get on board before you miss the boat
You have a chance and you only choose to sin faster
But don’t you know it’s evil when you live backwards
The hardest time in my life has been this chapter
But I’m only trying to live until I get raptured
Because when it’s all said and done, I wanna see the light
And you never know when you go to sleep at night
So when you do, repent and pray to Jesus Christ
Because He is The Way, The Truth, and The Life

[Chorus]
