[Intro Copywrite]
Yea, I'd like to take a second
Smooth things out on this one
Yea, yea, shout out to Stou Bangers

[Chorus]
So, if you smoke and drink away the pain
And you're trying to change but things just remain the same
So, if you smoke and drink away the pain
Face reality again and kill that sorrow
Watch the world die slow when you're full of sorrow
Life's too fucking good to spend it all full of sorrow

[ Verse 1 Copywrite ]
Mirror mirror on the magic wall
I grab my balls, ask away, I'll shake ...em, you'll get your answer ya'll
Blast away your brain that's the cure for cancer ya'll
Live in a world with answers wrong, slim chance to chance it all
So why we really here, that's too deep to talk about
So we get Philly's beer, do E and cough a clap
To keep it all the way honest, I'm still not over
The death of my mama or father, I'm trying to get by it, I promise
Plus I don't owe you shi* and vice versa
My life's worth this raise but it made my vice worser
I keep trying to stare my addiction dead in the eyes
Another staring contest lost, not getting a prize
Alright, I'm living in the same house my mom died
I swear I hear my mom's cries on quiet calm nights
Maybe that's why I cause a riot on site
Got me violent, trying to fight, just trying to be nice
What happens when your grip on reality starts slipping
(You?) gradually start flipping and families start tripping
Even Adam and Eve had to be deceived; even the fuck ups were
Written so second time around won't fuck up the vision

[ Chorus ]
So, if you smoke and drink away the pain
And you're trying to change but things just remain the same
So, if you smoke and drink away the pain
Face reality again and kill that sorrow
Watch the world die slow when you're full of sorrow
Life's too fucking good to spend it all full of sorrow

[ Verse 2 - Illogic ]
I'm at the bottom, under this ladder, trying to climb it
If paradise is lost, I'm trying to find it
Time is of the essence - there's lessons to be mastered
After time died, just killing time, no longer a past time practiced
Weeks go by, the sun rises and sets
We don't die ...cause triumph has no regret
Absolute truth hasn't been born yet
For most (axed?) the youth when the horn bled for hope If they cried
The tears shed and we wonder why
See, I'll do anything to wake the dead and feel alive
In my head I'm still alive, walking, speaking with my head up
...Til the weekend, where nothing inspires me to get up
Now speed up the pace to continue to chase
Don't procrastinate time's to precious to leave to waste
It's running out of runway; we'll touch the clouds one day
Until that day I wait ...cause I love how this sand tastes
With work I'll keep my eyes to the sky
In a world of mastered lies, there's no time to play
You'll survive, all you got to do is try
And remember even angels ain't too fly to pray
So this shouldn't be a surprise
Just open your eyes to see what I say
...Cause the sun still shines in the hearts of the blind
So I'll be on my way

[ Chorus ]
So, if you smoke and drink away the pain
And you're trying to change but things just remain the same
So, if you smoke and drink away the pain
Face reality again and kill that sorrow
Watch the world die slow when you're full of sorrow
Life's too fucking good to spend it all full of sorrow
