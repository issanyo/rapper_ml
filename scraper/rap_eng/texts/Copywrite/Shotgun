[Hook]
I can be your Kurt Cobain, girl
And you can be my Courtney Love with a shotgun to my brain, girl
What happens when I'm running through your veins, girl?
What happens when I'm running through your veins, girl?

[Verse 1]
I wanna know, do you love me or Courtney Love me
Do you want to blow my fucking brains out after of course you drug me
Fill me up with heroin so no force can budge me
Put my journals out, read, of course you judge me
No rock star wedding ever works
Picture me in a leather suit, you in a leather skirt
Wedding rites being thrown by the megahertz
"I love you," arguing over who said it first
You got me a fully loaded shotty for our anniverse
With a ------ -----, let me try it out, damn it works
Damn it got my plaid bloody
Laughing so hard, we're tearing up
This is kind of sad funny
You were with me back before I even had money
Now we having good with plenty by the bag honey
We've acquired an addiction
You need me, I need you, when we get higher
What were sniffing, with your prior ------ ------ from the kitchen
No lying every minute, I swear this bitch is flyer than a pigeon

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Is it really worth the running and the pain
Or should I just put a gun up to the brain
Nevermind, I put it to her head instead of mine
Lay the bitch down in a bed of lies, sever ties, several lies
When you tell a lie I could tell a lie
Didn't say much as a word, I'll let it slide
Getting revenge, hit on your friend, then she let it slide
Hit it again now she is my girlfriend, get a life
Cunt, you once were my gasp of air, babe
Now you can take a shit on a crashing airplane
If I passed the stairway, to heaven and your ass was near me
I'll tell God, "I'll pass on her mane"
Crass and weird dame, snake in the grass with earrings
I hate that we had to share things
But not as much as if we had to share names
Let me light your cigarette spray your ass with hairspray

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Got a call from the silly whore again
Want to kill me in my sleep, told the freak "call Billy Corgan"
Got to you, figured out what do I got to lose
Now I need help from Dr. Ruth and Dr. Drew
What's a shotgun do? Load it, cock, and shoot
(I can't fucking do this shit)
Hello kitty bitch, pretty idiot, itty bitty with pitty
And really it's sad, you prolly get it from dad
Your mom got her paying for your college with a good check
She's got fake tits collagen in her breasts
Look at you chugging the bottle with your puss wet
Modeling the book ----, follow in her footsteps
Holler when the mind gone
When the time from tomorrow, when you owe yesterday a dollar and a dime
You gone all up in my mind
Got a shotgun, blew my fucking thoughts on the roll and now I'm fine
