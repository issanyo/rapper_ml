[Verse 1: Copywrite]
Scram, skedaddle, bounce, if you had an ounce
I'd prolly battle you for it and leave you at a drought
This caucasian's got his cock raisin'
In your thot's twat, blazin' 'til my nuts soft like a hot raisin
(Listen.) Your fiction's got pulp in it
Master P, Master card's got no limits
Let multiple persons [?] on me, you gon' need to blast guns
Got multiple personalities, you don't even have one

[Verse 2: Metro]
But if you do have common sense
Under your do-rag, you should prolly use that (Who's that?)
Niggas [?] with a tool and Designer Lou bag
Who they tryna fool? Are you mad?
They wanna get a rise out of me, mad I won't go
Will I ever give a shit again? That, I don't know
Only time will tell, like a straight-up snitch
Or conversations when you're by yourself

[Verse 3: Copywrite]
Rockin' a holy crucifix is the only way I could get double crossed
Peter Parker, Spider shit, I see trouble, boss
Five DUI's, not the one you want to ride against
Tobey Macguire money, movie [?], I'm making Spidey cents
Now, Kiss Mary Jane. This very strange
I feel very high, but ain't blaze in many days
Large pimpin', scary with the flow
I'm Marge Simpson: married to the dough

[Verse 4: Metro]
'ey, tell 'em Large Marge said I knocked them niggas
In a marked car, knock them out the ballpark (hit 'em)
Busy birds and bloodstains be kitty purrs
Got them niggas come up for air like every fifty words
So attached, hoes tatted on their lower back
Some people lean into the shoulder snap
That's the difference of an inch and mile
Half these niggas wouldn't know if it was piss from a cloud (Ow!)

[Verse 5: Copywrite]
She wanna do something strange for no change like Barack Obama (Wait for it.)
There's no way you're heat - holdin', baby bitch, You ducked when you heard, "Okay, I'm reloaded."
But it was just a Jay-Z skit. Fuck you, pay me, bitch
Come through, make me rich. Kung fu, crazy kicks
Got in truck with Vodka in a McDonald's cup, and now I got a little Dewey like Donald Duck. (Fuck.)

[Verse 6: Metro]
Made a face like Donald Trump when he hit the blunt, then jumped like, "Y'all no fun."
Suicide is painless, so I've been told, but really, who am I to blame when you know it's a joke
I hear 'em talking, only blowing the smoke. I breathe fire.All the ugly bitches, be quiet
A muzzle to keep silent, a struggle to eat, we are like one on this beat, grindin' with guns underneath. (Bang.)

[Verse 7: Copywrite]
I called Tori up, 'fore he brought the story up 'bout how I relapsed last night and fucked forty sluts
I said, "Orgy, so that's why I'm sore as fuck." No pun, go run to the phone, rung Maury up
He said the baby's not a kin to me, dig it, I jumped up and clicked my heels like Jiminy Cricket
How peculiar, crowd yellin' Hallelujah, y'all be the grass in the shit like cow manure
