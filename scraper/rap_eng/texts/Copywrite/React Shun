[Verse One: Jakki]
Yo, I'll kidnap your wife, smash it of course
Spit game all week, let her go and watch her ask for divorce
Be sure you rocking it holmes cause sho' nuff Ock
I can put C-4 in erogenous zones and blow up spots
Turn your mind to aluminum, plus your team
If you sleep, I recycle your brain and crush your dream
Jakki The Motomouth
Supernatural rapping freak
Orthopedic magicians couldn't pull of my magic feat/feet
Got your CD like
We be hype
I don't give a damn like a greedy dyke salesman
The most offensive to blurt vain shit
Women get angry, all my girl's first name 'Bitch'
Your slut perform well last night, she's made for the sack
My dick was the crowd and I gave her the claps
Don't give a shit, it's a shame
A homeless chick come around me with a cup
She'll suck dick for the change

[Hook: Copywrite]
Whatever she's saying, prolly none of it fact (Why?)
Cause most chicken heads be running they yap

[Verse Two: Copywrite]
[?] orange horse hair buns
Spilling rum on my Air Force Ones, greys
I'ma retire to an Air Force One way
No nicotine
Only blow sticky green
Call no bitch a queen
Heart don't skip a beat
Although it's on freeze
Disagree?
Pay the penalty plus your dental fees, you missing teeth
Raise a Hennessy to my enemies hitting trees
Get ya green with envy while I'm getting green
With 20 16s and 24s
I'll rip clean your honey's drawers
That whore is a dick fiend who wanted more
Jake raided my place, now I got a sentence to face
Forgot to end the tape and she got a fetish for rape
Claim the trife life and you verses me is like Tyson Beckford
Getting in the ring with Mike Tyson
See me coming out a store empty handed it sure means
Police in Pakistan must of amputated my wrists

[Hook]

[Verse Three: Tame One]
Got me special on the label like a bottle of Henny
Independent as fuck, mentally ready for top 20
Get this money, Tame One is the game runner
Blacked out, put a track out the same summer
Didn't fall off, jumped off
Landed on my feet and walked off
Just to be different when some shit popped off
Under my mattress, right next to the Glock I shot at your moms with
Is the rhyme book I used to get signed to Eastern Conference
Better than half y'all rhymers
You know what time it is, it's obvious
You sponsored by Punchliners Anonymous
Weathermen veterans, amphetamines best friends
F's on piss tests
Nod like yes men
Grinding like teeth in a coke binge
Burn bridges at both ends
Seperate fiends from dope friends
Sick, psychosomatic, erratic, and bad habits
Rip reality fabric in half, dump in a tablet
