[Verse 1]
I grab the mic, talk shit and start up beef
And don't give a fuck if you from the 'burbs or from the streets
You rhyming, then it's kick to the curb time
You a cheat like niggas who use they accent to make they words rhyme
I rub you wrong until your chin is scared
Only the hand of God can pull my car and even then it's hard
I trick ya but it'll get in your ass kid
Give me pounds, it's like you giving daps to a cactus
We split, you didn't grab the rifle in time
The dick is was in your girl cause the bitch is rightfully mine
I'm sure of the rap fanatics that's sick of the kindergarten rapping habits
I'm sick of these niggas rapping average
You niggas mad when I disperse and it's you I bust
If there were two of us, you wouldn't last if I were first
So what the hell you gotta say?
I could grab your man by the body and snatch you both together in the fucking play
You opposing me? Bet you leave a personal doubt
Niggas who fuck with me find out they have convertible scalps

[Hook]
My crews out in the crowd booing your ass
Stage fright
You just stepped to the mic and I'm after you nigga
Stage fright
I'll form a cipher and take the crowd away from you
Stage fright
You just noticed a slapped a rainbow sticker on your back
Stage fright

[Verse 2]
Your silly reply was booty cake
I've seen better comebacks on pornographic movie tapes
And all the prehistory similes you feel upon
Is gonna land you spot in the Jerry Lewis Telethon
The Devil cursed you, see child?
It got the written shit that you spit sounding like horrible freestyles
Who authorized your eyes to look upon me?
I'll blind your mind, now your eyes aren't responding
You'll scream, "You oughta die" when I K.O. your reverend
Modify angels, steal a halo and qualify for Heaven
My mic will leave enemies scarred if you will not behave
Your life has no memory card, you will not be saved
Jakki's an a-hole with the brain capacity of Thanos
Wielding two Infinity Gauntlets to slay foes
You weaklings suck
I'm like a masturbater with an insomnic penis
I'll beat you if you keep it up
I have phenomenal specs, I'm an ominous vet
So show up, I laugh at bomb threats, fuck what you blow up
Grow up, you eat niggas so what?
Cause the fact is, my hunger exceeds that of Galactus
If you could fuck with the world I'll exceed your fallacy
And strike with every star I can find in the galaxy
'Til the end of time, I leave the mic energized
Get crews hooked like Pinhead on the USS Enterprise

[Hook]
You rocked the crowd and in the crowd I'm rockin' your girl
Stage fright
Your mama's in the audience calling you wack
Stage fright
I brought your dad to support me and spit on you
Stage fright
Me and my buddy Grim Reaper are staring at you
Stage fright

[Verse 3]
Every time a nigga rhyme while looking at the ground
Showing no confidence, kicking a silly style, it makes me frown
Your raps suck you pitiful bastard
You didn't have a natural birth, your mama threw your ass up
Whenever you come clever, I simply grin
'Cause your cleverness won't help you avoid this strangle I'ma put you in
Your complexity is absurd to me
To go over my head you'll need a ladder that exceeds eternity
Who wanna fool with me? C'mon I'm too tight
You'll need a mic and jar of K-Y Jelly to screw with me
I innovate, crack your fucking dental plate
Seven intellect continents couldn't match my mental state
Bring on your faggot crew you'll see 'em all tossed
Better yet scrub a pig, your raps are hog wash
I live and bled, motherfucker come scared
'Cause even if your name was Modulok you couldn't compare
I'm so sophisticated with finishing cats
Look in the mirror and watch my own reflection give me daps

[Hook]
I brought 30 homeless drunks to be your hype men
Stage fright
I just replaced your DJ with a blow up doll
Stage fright
Your ADAT has just been replaced by an 8-Track
Stage fright
You just came out of your trance and realized you wack
Stage fright
