[Verse] [Copywrite]:
Give me three acid tablets or three bags of hash bitch
MC's bad as habits cause rehabs for faggots
You see that's a bad bitch but she has the magic
Listen here, that sage will make you disappear
You're makin' what?
I'm doin' shows tryin' to cake it up
Makin' cuts just goin' to sleep while y'all are wakin' up
Fryin' bacon?
I'm lyin' naked in Jamaica drunk
Blazin' up with a stud I can't even say, I'm stuck
I never had a bone in my body broken boss
But if your hotties open by the bone she could get broken off
My crew be hand to hand
Movin' units out of van
Then drive to Florida to bang Rue Mcclanahan
Mastered what?
You bastards want
Amazin' y'all
When I raise the bar like a liquor tax went up
Ah, y'all fucks spittin' wrong
I'm just shittin' on
Anyone who's been out for years and I'm just gettin' warm
