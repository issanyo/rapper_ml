[Verse One: Copywrite]
See, if you put the drugs to use I don't see it as drug abuse
I'm seeing the drugs as juice, vitamin E and a cup with juice
Whether I'm geeked or sober, this shit is a breeze
Wear diapers to bed, I can do this shit in my sleep
Look, they thought I was gone for good
Boy they were wrong cause look
They sped and backed up twice, drove off and I was on the hood
My right hand ripped through the cemetery dirt
Angel on my shoulder told me, pretend you're scared and hurt
They extended the leary hand to help
Lent it very firm
And I grabbed a hold of the wrist and fuckin' ripped from where it turned
So I'm back
Foot in the ground, one foot in the ditch
Kept my spot warm for me, aww, you shouldn't of bitch
Hi Haters, hiatus proof as good as it gets
Get it? Good, got it from me, give it, what good is it bitch?
Took some time off, still nobody as good as some shit
I'll take some more off, but morons, they could've been rich
Bitch I'm alive

[Verse Two: Copywrite]
Man I think I know why I got 'em pissed
There's some Movado on the wrist
Porsche pushin', lookin' like I won the lotto in this bitch
Lord look at him
I know I can't take it when I die
So while I'm still alive, fuck it, let's take it for a drive
Before I take that big vacation in the sky
Gonna say I Did It My Way like Frank did in his prime
Can't break me and my stride, they hate when you're alive
But rate you in the top five greatest if you die
Damn homie, don't Van Gogh me
Will fans show me love for my art once my heart spins it's 10th jam on me?
Hate tying ties so I keep one with the knot in it
I fear the day I'm being judged and I'm not in it
I picked the lonely hours, travelin' the road for miles
Sleeps the cousin of death and momma was an only child
Same shit daily, sun rising and the sun sets
But I plan to excel/XL like the size above one X

[Verse Three: Motion Man]
Still up and kickin' as the ultimate
? students is still truant, I made it back as the principle
Any municipal addict universally visible
Seeing me live at 40, I'm God's proof there are miracles
Always flowin', the desktop folder still growin'
Amazin' people, the dollar sign, plus dollar sign
I'm past equal
The dollar sign minus dollar sign like your spine outta line
You couldn't try to Copywrite Pete with motion delete
We keep endurance like some athletes
Retreat, never sidestep like bounce on your feet
I sow and I reap
And take the tape like Lee in Beat Street
You can't stop the rompin' mop up the maids vacuum the clean up
Needs the people outta lock up so we can take over regions
I'm a live person
Only option involved
You a mind virgin
Nobody hide behind blogs
I'm alive
