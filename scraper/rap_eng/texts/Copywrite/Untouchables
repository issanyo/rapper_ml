[Verse 1 - Copywrite]

Any day of the week, nah fuck that, any hour of the day
You can catch me black out from the power of the haze
Waking up the next day like, what the fuck happened?!
Heard I fucked a slut napping, woke up and busted a nut rapid
I lusted for platinum, record sales, the bitch walked out with a necklace from Zales
Yanked it, then headed for an exit and failed
Waking up to steak and eggs, then breaking legs
Bitches I make 'em beg, for dick, then I'm taking bread
This is where your luck stops, picking up bitches hitchhiking at truck stops
Fucking them and dropping them off at bus stops
The only person living, cold enough to murder you in cold blood
Heat it up, then eat it up with cold lunch
The best ever to get cheddar, and jets never
I can jump before I run, threats never affect whether
I dash or stick around, I'm plastered, liquored down
Licked her down like a lesbian, then stabbed and kicked her out

[Verse 2 - Possessed]

Let it be known anything goes, I'm dope
So its to be expected that I get up your nose
Facial expression is stone
Meditate in acid rain, til my skeleton shows
Larvae of the Lord of the Flies
Ask Emily Rose, I'm more than a thorn in her side
Keep organs on ice, head crawling with lice
Each day I lose a little more of my mind
Human torture device, an order of knights
Raising our swords up, to the orb in the sky
All for one, one for all
It's Rhyme Asylum and Copywrite, we untouchable
Supremacy preordained, wield Daywalker sword's blade
Paid my dues and was shortchanged
Devil in a Northface
Used my intestines to find my way out a Minotaurs maze

[Verse 3 - Psiklone]

Shut your mouth in the presence of God
Iâ€™ll haunt your house warming, until the temperature drops
Send you into electrical shock
And if you're lucky, I'll make you hack your own testicles off
I'm devouring cannibal corpses
Believe me, I've seen things that will make Hannibal nauseous
Enter battles on galloping horses
And cypher, til other MCs die of natural causes
We're heartless tearaways
Sea monsters bursting through the surface, snatching passing aeroplanes
Exceeding peak Intelligence
Leave irrelevant MCs developing speech impediments
Write lyrics that defy physics
Lap the planet, in a time limit of five minutes
We morph into the form of the four horsemen
Warlords swinging blows at your George Foreman
