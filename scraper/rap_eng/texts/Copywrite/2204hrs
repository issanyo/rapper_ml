Angle, Verse 1:
From the back to the future, we run on plutonium. Marty and Doc? Nope, Copy and Angleoneous
Flux capacitor, fires, I’m ownin’ ‘em. This is the point where the shit gets draconian
Know me and mine are ahead of the time, might take ten listens before you’re getting my lines
That’s when you see the headlights, move bitch, get out the way and get behind
Or join the band and start pulling the wagon with the booming system and the beats we’re jacking
Let’s get the bodies packed in for crying out loud, like Pookie in a room we’re going to get it cracking
With the samples crackling, CLEAR, not here, speakers rattling
Patrons chattering. Hands in the air like a firing line’s happening and I got the Gatling
Oops! I mean mic device, now put two thumbs up ‘cause you like it twice
Penny for my thoughts, I oughtta hike the price, you paid admission to get in, we’re getting hype tonight
That’s only right, from the future we’re back, rappers adapted and the raps got fast
Quicker little fragments pass, that’s all these kids’ span of attention will grasp
And it doesn’t matter where you’re at, so what you sayin’? No crap to give this is how rap will live
All patch work like Frankenstein ass, throwing kids in the deep where they find they can’t swim
Well, the doctor’s in, putting 1.21 gigawatts in, let the madness begin
Doesn’t have to be, exactly four minutes past 10pm
Tonguing the mic like an auctioneer, they want to be emcees with a hot career
Talking a lot, but not much to hear, stand in line and take this here shot in the ear
Copywrite, Verse 2
