Slow down! Slow down!
Eh, we’re going to slow this one down real quick
You know, hey Jakki you with me?
Hope you still with me
We got open beers in the car
As you know
C-Write
Jakki
Eh, I’m a spit it like this
Check it out
I’m a spew the fire

[Verse 1 - Copywrite]
The flow solid ice
So I spit frigid plus
Gettin’ sick with it
With a temperature above six digits
Get it? Don’t see jump
I’m married to the game
No prenup, if she dump me
She giving cheese up
Got amnesia
You not remember, then it’s C dog
I stomp you with my Timberland
Show you the real d-club
Fortis memberment’s a fool
Membership, join now
And get your boy blao
To cut the noise out
You trembling
Like a demon in Christ’s presence
If I bought you a pair of Jordan’s
You wouldn’t have mic presence
Y’all mic peasants
I might bless it
Might
Who are we kidding?
But in return you might
End up with all your jewelry missing
Might
Who are we kidding again?
I’m such a joker
Such a smoker
Pick a chick up
In a Mr. Frosty
Chuck’n poker
You think you’re hot?
You’re not, stop lying
Me, myself, I’m on fire
Smoke alarms go off when I walk by ‘em
No match for me, so mad at me
Cause I’m young
Grindin’ harder than a coke addicts teeth
If I had a penny for each time they blaspheme the chant
I be wiping my ass clean with grants
But if they want war
Lets go ADT best be on they rest
Cause I take it way beyond they thres-
-Hold, just know, play flying the S
Best be on they chest
I have you rapping through a wire
Like you Kanye West

[Verse 2 - Jakki Tha Motamouth]
I’m screwing your dame
Six millas ruined your game
I cheat on my bitch
I kill her if she doin’ the same
Motamouth giving cyphers
With ridiculous axe
Not rappin’ just smackin’
Any nigga that raps
Pass your chick
You all wild?
Grab your click
I’m a take your dogs out
Like they had to shit
Ask your bitch
I’m people why she stand with the kid?
She want me to ice her wrist
I throw her hands in the fridge
I’m a cheapskate
Boo when they cost me the date
In church
Stick IOU’s in the offering plate, a jerk
Pick my own booze when it comes to communion
Pick my own ruse, hoe pregnant
Then her stomach I’m bruisin’
I got you pissed
Please dog you got me bit
Hell yeah I lock lips with yo’ sloppy bitch
And you ain’t doing shit except looking a fool
Looking a prude, that you could fuck with me
But lookin’ for dudes, to jump me
Nah, it ain’t even poppin’ like that
Punks weak and box more than three bots with a gat
Stale flow, soldier with you
Hell grows colder
We collaborating, good news
Hell froze over
Fiend to be raw
I could do this dude with one mutter
You easily solved
Like a Rubik’s cube with one colour
Heaven or the mean place
Got me deeply debatin’
Go to hell with a brief case
I got a meetin’ with Satan

Whoa whoa buddy slow down!
You see that cop?
You see that cop?
Uh, that was a toy cop
I’m drunk
Pass that
Shit, Cruise Control y’all
Stay with us
