[Verse One: Jakki The Motamouth]
All y'all bitches
Chickens
It's this
Nigga that'll give your ass dick then dip quick
If I come off nice guy it's an act
Cause nice guy is tryin' to get your ass in the sack
And trust to death I crush the best
You don't believe ask the broads that I fucked then left
And best believe kiddies, I get sluts
It's funny, homos/feminists don't like what I say but still give me dick sucks
Yeah homie, I'm rude
I respect my nigga Snoop when he say "He don't love the hoes", but I do
Matter of fact I got 10 that I love now
Six of 'em in Jacksonville, four of 'em in Bus Town
I'll lapse these niggas that's holdin' these broads
Go to work I'm right at the back do' when he gone
Now, any cat that wanna fight against Jakk
Get ya life right with Christ cause your life will get snatched
With your wife, she'll get waxed
I don't care who the husband is
Fuck without the condom and she'll bare your muhfuckin' kids
Without the blood test how you gonna prove it's mine?
She'll be lyin' to you like, "Damn it boo he has your eyes."
And your ass is blind
Go to banks, put the money in the case
Gettin' robbed with a plastic nine
See what I charge?
You say it's just a screwdriver, but it's also the key to your car
See ya tomorrow
Put your whole evening in sorrow
If she won't let me have it, best believe I'mma borrow
Homie, I'm a real MC
Smile at these funny dudes
I listen to lyrics I don't care about your .22
I will key your car
Call me a "hater" and I'll accept that title
Eat your broad, call me and take her
You pissed off cause I'm charming but later
Your bitch cross cause my dick raw
This broad stall me, I'll rape her with no question
Throw them lame threats I'm that same vet
You collide with me you will feel like you was in a train wreck
And your girly with you still cause she ain' heard my game yet
Let her loose around me homie, you will get your dame checked
I'm the hottest shit
Grimy with a lot of lip
If I spot your chick she eye me dawg, I got your bitch
You gon' do what?
You talkin' too much
I thinkin' female sheep testicles, ewe/you nuts

[Hook: Copywrite]
You're makin' what?
We're at our shows tryin' to cake it up
Makin' cuts, just goin' to sleep while y'all are wakin' up
Yeah, I'm on my grind cousin
(Grind cousin)
Time doesn't stop
I'm on my grind cousin, fuck a clock

[Verse Two: Copywrite]
Dedicated to outlaws who move out soft
With New Year's resolutions and are tryin' to get a few pounds off
And petty thieves with heavy dreams but only penny schemes
Who make a fiend believe a methamphetamine is anything
So if you're clean, what I write will offend ya
Cause I don't rap for anyone with a clean record
Unless they're a vinyl collector
I'm not thugged out or gangster at all
But after a few drinks of the tall, I'm anxious to brawl
And as fuck as sluts, fuck every hoe, I don't trust any
My girl said "Don't fall in love" she ain't say "Don't fuck any"
I
Love every straight edge 20 that let me plow her
Minus any powder, keyless entry like an Eddie Bauer
Plenty Sour, D for me it's "no" to these hoes
You think I suffer from allergies so much blow in my nose
Ask me I'm stingy
All about me, wipe my ass with a Benji
But smack a hoe if she ask for a penny
