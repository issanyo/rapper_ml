[Verse One: Copywrite]
You've been tryin' to promote like Mike Jones all summer
You gave your number
Out to the public but only got called once and it was a wrong number
Who's better?
Name who's one on the list
You runnin' your lips but nothings coming out cause he doesn't exist
I pump hunger in every one of my shits
Young hungry Pun, under 21 guzzling Schlitz
Add a little coke, lace it with some dust too
Call the buddha King Koopa, I'm chasin' it with mushrooms
Plus two shots of Henny on the rocks
And if the beat's nuts/Beatnuts I'll take it like Jenny From The Block
Remy in my thermos nervous cause if anybody
Search us got a semi auto and a Henny bottle I just purchased
Workin' self, it ain't work it's just words
I just put it together to work on the nerve
Of whoever purchased or burned it
Old school, new school, need to drop out
I Burn Baby Burn like weed in 'Pac's mouth
I turn crazy curves so please do not shout
Ambitionz of a Ridah tryin' to skate from the cops route
Without a penny, haters wanna make a knife slice in ya
Imagine their actions if my name was in lights like Splenda
First they love ya then they hate ya, then they crave your failure
That's just the name of The Game like Jayceon Taylor
Y'all vagina rappers
Motherfuckers thought I got in a squabble with Mike Shinoda's DJ
Y'all only left Minor scratches
Twist the story lines if ya want
We'll leave you cats bleeding, period, when it's the time of the month
Five pound in the trunk to light someone up
You'll be like a child in a bathtub, you might wanna duck
No mirage, the flow God, breathin' the witty bars
Dawg, I go hard like I'm leavin' a titty bar

[Verse Two: Catalyst]
Who else other than the God?
The Elohim
The One on his Neo thing
I'm the C.O. king
Gettin' neck like a guillotine
I'm hard to kill, far as skill?
Shit, I think I'm Crazy like Cee-Lo Green
You wanna try? Bring your team
You don't wanna die
Better have a couple 9's on you like Gino Green
Tryin' to get kilo cream
With no kids so I always keep a hat on down south like Chingo Bling
So I don't have to share a single thing
When I blow up and throw chips around like it's a casino scene
But when the chips are down
A nigga hittin' ever lick in town
Till my crime record can't fit the file
And when they get to trial, fuck that, skippin' trial
Tryin' to hold more liquor down than my nigga can
And get blunted out, puffin' clouds
So high, Fat Al couldn't talk me into comin' down
So I don't think you niggas wanna clown
The last one who did it, hit him so hard the nigga spun around
So fast in a circle that it drilled him underground
In my town, I don't fuck around
Kill him for the crown
So any thug rapper, can get cut faster
Than a Dutch Master, for his blood plasma
You wanna come last cause
Anything I spit automatically outshine any verse that come after
To learn you dumb bastards, behold
I'm the whole, you ain't even one half of
Seein' what you lack of
Mister, I have your sister givin' me a back rub
Fuck her in the shower till I'm skeetin' in your bathtub
When I beat her back up
Think a nigga frontin'
But my wood stay hittin' somethin' like Derek Jeter bat does
Hottest nigga outta my city, blowin' the state up
You can't find a wallet to fit me, the more I cake up
That's why the fans pollying with me showin' me crazy love
Like Bobby and Whitney before the break up
My God
Crazy madness
Stackin' the doe like Kathrine and Joe makin' crazy Jacksons
Yeah
Gettin' money this year
You like Tracy Chapman
You dread gettin' ugly in here
Nigga honestly, you don't wanna bring the beast outta me
He's an animal, a cannibal who eats hourly
Dawg, can't possibly, stop a nigga hot as me from burnin' y'all
Hard to lose..
Ahh
