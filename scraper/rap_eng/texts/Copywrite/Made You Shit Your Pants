[Verse One: Copywrite]
My next album's gonna come with lotion, home skillet
You can go fuck yourself if you don't feel it
All I took is liquor, marijuana, six strippers in a sauna
Pen and pad, now I got buzz quicker than Nirvana
First, you non violent, now you in your verse wildin'
Your only Criminal record is BDP's first album
Cop purple haze and be the first to blaze
When cops roll up everybody in my circle stays
Fuck your baby mama on Mother's Day
Dump my blunt ashes in that bitches purse when she turn her head the other way
I'm foul, and don't give a shit what a motherfucker say
Live it up till each minutes up we might not get another day
In a truck, tinted up, yeah It's rented but
This chick won't know that, till after she licks my bozack!!!
Get my Prozac, I'm like Tony Soprano
The way I kill Big Pussy and my bitch don't know that

[Hook: Copywrite]
They shooting!
Aw, made you shit your pants
Better call your bitch, forget your mans
Speaking of his, playboy she mine now
Where my Weathermen at? Follow the dime cloud

[Verse Two: Cage]
P.S.K. playing I'm saying neurotic shit
Y'all look to the clouds ask for the Weather and got it
Whether I'm potted, I'm blotted out of this orbit, absorb shit
Cause only five percent don't really want to be corporate!
Most of y'all favorite artists made y’all slaves to garbage
The influence'll drop, they rape the carcass
Then it's off to the living for cannibalism, no kidding
Cause rap is dying and they ain't make no ribbon
I'm thinking.. of the stress, and the air I breathe through
Drugs don’t fund terrorists, SUV’s do!
But y'all don’t want me to point it out I'm assuming
Just remember to turn on and tune out, after you tune in!
