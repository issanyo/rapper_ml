[Sample]
Same as it never was (x2)

[Verse 1: Masai Bey]
The ignorant idioms you've chosen sound spoken
Straight from the thoughts of a medium
Who protects his mind just to lose it
And reveals the demons that brooded
I'm talking matters of why you want to stop
No room on the planet for weathermen that are not
We got Cannibal Oxes for your snotty box
That means stamina, the vast program, aye yo
When I'm on the mic, the cover becomes a tan
And every verse is like a whole damn jam
This is simple, and yet it's hard as hell
Front, it'll be time to relocate yourself

[Verse 2: Camu Tao]
System in an ageing over years of light
He made it and sent off the decorated emits
Stay raw and wide range and migraines
And spit over the blue prints and diagrams
I have an extreme constructed titanium tinting around my right iris
With a shutter speed
That sees silence and spreads rooms
And program on the fields with flame matter
You can catch me running diagnostics on close range hits
And closed cases, and whats more
With a closed caption
I put a main squeeze on the Earths core
[?} brains of an on guard when they refuse to do
What the system do and move like the system moves
I can move this room we sittin' in with my two bare... minds
And crack the roof the feed these black holes some sunshine
I'm still sitting in for this shit again
?Would? back up and eat it, still stealin'
And still feedin'

[Hook]
(Same as it never was) (x8)

[Verse 3: El-P]
I felt the sickness and my food sat in your exact point of entrance into the circle of life and it's disturbing me
So if I react with a ?ass that he bounced? please pardon that I'm an insect and I'm sent for the radar bitch threats
And you can explain to your collectors how you got tossed off the set by an overweight rapper who chain smokes cigarettes
Who melted your nose bow with rock and ?more time? 'till it smells like balsamic vinaigrette, I'm not finished yet
If I could suffer through you, I'd leave this space a physical plane of puritan, or earn back my virginity
That seems a reasonable price to exchange simply for feathered wings or an afterlife of divinity
Sees it in the vic shit for bitch brain liquid
With a stain that hollows out nerve like a tooth beaver
And talks a ? to take the AIDS blood, two liters above you
Because you're not raw you're below sickness
I have you an amish clothing hiding your only witness
?'Till they're late and see if your dick rider powers are ride gimmicks?
We fell in love with your sad face a long time ago
Cause you grew up to be an asexual dynamo
This might seem simply put, but I outmeasure the apparatus with the tiniest fragment of pure manhood
Plus you forgot that you got your whole style from me
Just like a true Company Flow fan would

[Verse 4: Copywrite]
I'm my own worst enemy, me vs ten of me
I'll kill eight and make the two left clean the mess of me
These faggot labels pay me to hold back
So I won't outshine their artists on their own tracks
And mixing us? please, that's like mixing beetle juice with Medusa and Pugsley
This situations real fucking ugly
And you ran through the entrance brave, before checkin' if there was an exit to this parametric maze
I enter Hell’s doors, waltz through dispensing pain
Then exit flawless while you barely entertain
The next are flawless, while you barely entertained
A legend since my parent's sperm and egg met
I got psychics quoting shit that I ain’t even said yet
You can't have a top five when there's not me in it
When this drops you'll cop it
Then you're copying it
Y'all eat [?] when El brings a beat that's heated
Cause I kill it, resurrect it then repeat if needed

[Hook]
(Same as it never was) (x4)

[Verse 5: Vast Aire]
I'm an element in disperse, gone with the wind
Make them gusty... And when the knight wants the king's wife
You can't even trust me
It ain't like I got eggos over my head and wings to protect me
Tackle the mic type radio angry
Caught the QB with his hand up, he can’t stand up
They had the cannibal trapped up north (shackles)
And the only way out meant one face off
So I hid the pen in my hand and broke it apart, and use the contents inside to start the break out
Left one cat in the elevator, seizure had him faked out
Lambs are so quiet now as societies fallen
I got one life to live and raps the callin'
And park my rhyme bars from the stars and record 'em
And outline the constellation, the sky's margin
Close the book, sky dims, limits us often
