Y'all know what it is...
That's right...Copywrite yo...Tage yo...
We're here to greet y'all haters, with open arms, with the clip out
Aight I'm just livin' while haters let it get them jealous
It's like my man Tage said, matter fact ima? let him tell it

[Verse 1:Tage]
Developing new alchemy megas on the balcony
No none of y'all amount to we as soon as you count to three its 'bout to be on
He stood on a roof steady telling y'all he's part of proof
They the truth like sodium brevital get a clue
Tryna get across smooth set it off through the mainstream
But he can't seem to get a better view
Left the crew met a few coerced 'em to paint a different picture of himself
Till his shit hits the shelf
A so so'd hoes flow this flow blowed
In his own world gassed by fake niggas and his own girl
Gas made it hard to see soon as infantry partially brought out
Rhymes rarely thought out he's caught out
His shit sank in six months we stopped listening
His old crew got a major deal dissin him
He's pissin in the wind that we blow
Any particular city we leaving young people restless like Genoa City
Hear me we squeeze tough till it's mush and the pus starts to gush
You get crushed by some niggas like us fo sho
Cause this game has converted angry feminists to promiscuous polygamous
Suggest you consider this or get burnt tryna be heroic
You one of many statistics it's the same shit different toilet now

These hard times got us putting bars to beats
So stressed I can hardly sleep
Won't let these bitches tempt me
The fridge is empty and I hardly eat
Everyone who starves these streets
Even lame cats claim that they deserve a part to eat
What part of the game is that
It's the part of the game the rules they hardly read
Now listen

[Verse 2: Copywrite]
All around the globe the same old song
Think this shit'll change you got the game all wrong
The same day an NBA rookie shoots his first three point shot
A seasoned vets knee joints lock
And once your parents breed dog
You ain't guaranteed shit except some air to breath smog
And some guaranteed shit
A new day another light grey hair
It's like a millionaire tryna take a bus to heaven when life ain't fair
And when you're rock bottom somebody's on top
Sometimes somebody gets signed somebody gets dropped
Its lottery odds save your first mil
While he just spent his last dollar on the tape you made ya cash off of
Might ??? but if you never felt pain I feel for ya
That first raw deal taught ya it's some real torture
I smoke with myself pull gats in the mirror
Sometimes tell jokes to myself and laugh in the mirror
I feel like I'm going insane not knowing my brain
Can hold and sustain the pain that comes from growing in age
Knowin noone can lower the flames or open the clouds
Also knowin my style never been to throw in the towel
Plus I'm done walking that line between gettin jerked and payin dues
And stayin true really depends on what ya say and do
So say you pop shit by breakfast, get buried by lunch
Ya mouth wrote a check you can't cash with unverified funds

These hard times got us putting bars to beats
So stressed I can hardly sleep
Won't let these bitches tempt me
The fridge is empty and I hardly eat
Everyone who starves these streets
Even lame cats claim that they deserve a part to eat
What part of the game is that
It's the part of the game the rules they hardly read
Now listen
