[Verse One: King.dom]
I get mad ducks, two at a time, they add fuck
Make 'em split the pole cause I be givin' them hoes bad luck
Not a dime, robbin' you blind
And make your mufuckin' property mine
I mean all of it
Cut your phone line, no mo' niggas is callin' it
Back of the church, ?? flash with mad ??
Got a nice system, get jacked while you installin' it
Don't fight fare, I stab niggas I'm brawlin' with
Dames sustain, get a plate, not pausin' it
Layin' the block coughin', sayin' the wrong shit to her
?? balls swallower you gave her a long kiss
And I came with a four fifth of a hater that's on this
When I aim it, it won't miss
Like my nut when it spray in the face of your sis
She came for 'dro I laced with base and powder
Now her face sliding 'cross home plate
Why you chicks tryin' to monkey around with grown apes?
You the chump I'm the champ quit jumpin' my style
You move vials while you movin' bowels
Eeeeck
Nothin' but gruntin', shittin' and movin' around
In 2000 I had a new style for the 0-8
The future's future and the future is now
Hear the flow yo, a few of you should've drown
You fags, why you rockin' a tutu? Get a gown
Upgrade like droppin' a deuce deuce, get a pound
.45, he was rockin' a deuce deuce 'fore he died
Steady drinkin', I'm rockin' a deuce deuce 45
Gettin' bent like the hammer you bought
You a fag, you soft
And your bitch is soundin' like a man when she talk
You stalkin' bitches that I block from my phone and steal my boxers
So they can smell my cock when I'm gone
You man to man with the D
Your hustle game is really not in the zone

[Verse Two: Copywrite]
I don't even like rap
I came to get a dime bag from the engineer
And he said he'd be right back, so fuck it, where's the mic at?
A con artist that bomb hardest as Saddam in his prime
Bin Ladin and Optimus Prime, only ??
I'm as hot as it gets and I'm proud of my sweat, I'mma shine
Shoutin' my set till the time they're countin' my debt for my pine
My mom's payin' it off cause she's countin' the checks from my rhymes
Reminiscing how I couldn't scratch a cent when I was alive
I slap dimes asses harshly when they get out of line
And cram bags full of parsley when I run out of dimes
You're out of time, out of sight and out of mind
Rewinding my album's lines, tryin' to pick out ??
I don't hit the studio to waste my time
Nah, I'm a klepto in a Rolex store, I take my time
Take yours and take what's mine while I'm in the line
Spit it violent as a lion while you silent as a mime

[Verse Three:Meta4ce Omega]
I'm in this bitch back, sippin that 'yak
These bad bitches on my lap, tryin' to get at my cash
I can't give it bitch listen
Not givin' a stack to dance women
I make a livin' off of givin' that ass for cash dividends, no
I be killin' it, she's feelin' me, she's feelin' it
No she ain't concealin' it, consider who you dealin' with, oh
Yo, you know she's somethin; like a dime
I'm a pimp and that hoe's fuckin' mine, yes I'm
Better with gettin' cheddar, I'm 'mo clever than you
Lil' dude, I ain't cocky I'm just better than you
It's true, I'm just tryin' to stick dick to your girlfriend
Drink till I'm hurl, get rich 'fore the world ends
Nah, alcohol problem, I ain't got one
Cause it's only a problem when I got none
So kill that bullshit that you hollerin'
Fake shit comin' out your lips: collagen
