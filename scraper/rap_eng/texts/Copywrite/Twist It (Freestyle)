Call me Snoopy, top dog on the roof

Snoopy Iceburg on, I'mma mute, bird followin', too

Pied pipe, minus the child song on the flute

Single file line, pile dimes all in the coup

Let's go, the one I liked was tryin' to be defiant

Thought the only way I'd get her wet was by a hydrant

Then I told who I signed with, my eyes squint

The brain was so good, she blinded me with science

Let the rental whirl, spinnin' and I earled reckless

Gave your flirty bitch a thirty inch pearl necklace

Said girl, check this, I lied when I said I was signed

But lifes a bitch and the worlds sexist

So take it in stride

My boys burn blueberry, you hear me? I don't mean bakin' a pie

Shit was so hot we started introducin ourselves to each other

Smoke it all from good trees to cheap lumber

I'm the man, so pump up the jam

I up jump the boogie to fuck up your plans

Freaks open, hoes stayed are deepthroatin'

And I came, got hot, but okay I'm reloaded

Y'all niggas 'bout to twist it, huh?

Club fight crew leave a few scars

Your ass dumbs out when you drunk

Your ass won't make it to see tomorrow

Y'all niggas 'bout to twist it, huh?

Club fight crew leave a few scars

Your ass dumbs out when you drunk

Your ass won't make it to see tomorrow

We step up in the club, we're unclean

Drug fiends turn a club to a drug scene

Get rid of that drink, get rid of that dutch, we about to earl

We about to earl, We about to earl

We about to earl, We about to earl

Either side of the coin, I'm hard

Reason I'm regarded as pointguard

Of all joints, I guarded the ball point

Your whole joints I snored through, face it

Bring a force of hatred to complicate shit for these basic

Off trees and a concoction

Just one option cause not one of who your occustomed

Make way for the bust, we'll hustle the foundation

Do math, tryin' to travel the path without satan

But some cats prefer to be learned

Certain these shots will leave you with more spots than a dalmation

Y'all cats ain't heard of me, but that didn't occur to he

He was hopin' the surgury was out-patient

Nope, my flow game is so sign cocaine

Saxaphone Coltrane, Hank Hill on propane

Don't provoke me on a toke of that special

Toke choke that'll have you out twistin' a pretzel, let's go

Twist 'em up, yup, y'all some sittin' ducks

Mind it, might try to find another bitch to fuck

I'm in the club hazed out, not concerned with others

Roll a dutch, light it up, let it burn like Usher

Fucker, plus your ho, she's tryin' to ride

Stay fresh to death like my soul was cianide

Yep, and thats' the king, he's the choice of freaks

One verse and Kay Slay'll loose his voice for weeks

But y'all fake and conterfeit, y'all don't know Dominic

The shit the kid be spittin''ll have y'all trickin' in astonishment

And once the chronic's lit your bitch is gettin' honest

Quick talk bout she love how he get down on her plus she's he's on his dick

All kinda shit listen to twice and you're rewindin' it

Inclined to spit, still can make the owner of those diamonds sit beside your bitch

And if she's fast with the game

She gettin', broke off like a clasp on your chain

Ain't cuttin' slack for no lames, half of y'all rappers just suck

Against the King, you take an L, like I passed you a dutch

Feel the agony, I'm never shook to peal caps, dog

I got my strong arm steady and will blast y'all
