.....Megahertz, hmm. [Copywrite78]
Yo this is our sell out shit
Yo coming out of the crevices of the underground
Its Tage quarrel and. [Tage*Proto]
Copywrite MC, 78 degrees. [Copywrite78]
With the questionnaire that is yet to be answered. [Tage*Proto]

-----Somebody's gotta start it-----

Yo, why would you choose to battle Tage when you average. [Copywrite78]

[Copywrite78]
And how could somebody of the opposite oppose Copywrite
---We prefer to think about the responsibilities we have to the music, music, music---

[Copywrite78]
We're absotively posolutely sure we got the cure for the common rhyme at the bein time

[Tage*Proto]
I house mics with innovative furniture
And engrave upon the palms of pawns an eternal eviction notice
Many of linear webs
Not a familiar verse instead it causes me to only lose battles each 31st of Feb
Your ethnic background's European a heart and I'm seekin' a
Or speakin even ????? applause for the ????? instructoral engineer
Slash minister, effa-ca-editor a sources divorces a planets hemisphere
With text etched in my pad
I'm a biochemical all collector
Major major to ta my professor
Have the autistic school
Colum-bust that ass
Regarding the completion of speech ya'll better all sleep in the beach
I'm eager to teach any MC a lesson
The only man I fear is my nigga Reef
And his last is Lection, so you make the connection
It erases homeostatis
Even with a ?V-Atis?
While defrost glaciers You canâ€™t catch wreck if it were contagious
Face this my basis is to perplex you cleptics put hectic electrons through a hiatus

Never the less..... [Copywrite78]

[Tage*Proto]
Arrest your status
Pattern the palindromes ??????????? metronome
A racecar and a space ?????? they confiscate your face scar
You'll immerse with stratagems that stimulate narcoleptic ???? after third shift
Headaches the theoretics Fed-Ex traumedics is useless in fightin that infact
I bit my tongue and bite back and attack in spite of the splits
It's the unsung who guns conundrums
I rhyme enough to know this verse serves as backstage passes to your puppet show

So, why would you choose to battle Tage when you average. [Copywrite78]

And how could somebody of the opposite oppose Copywrite. [Tage*Proto]

---3 o'clock calendar, or just rap.....---

[Tage*Proto] [Copywrite78]
We're absotively posolutely sure we got the cure for the common rhyme at the bein time

Check it out....

These cute little toxi-nines sippin phonic writers option battles the highest spittin biters
Watchin objects collected from dimensions unheard
I mention one word self-proclaimed competition wants
So listen yo full aim help ta drop the mission
Constantly toss consonants towards continents to inflict
The fluctuating speech to meet teach and flush factions
Using words that speak louder than actions
After I talk and spark shit awkwardly
I got rappers once thought they ran shit afraid to walk with me
And mainstream later made study extreme text
????? dash told me to take a reign supreme check
And we still remain suspension engineers
And biochemists, till we say when the end is near
Soft crab cats catch cough from two ills
No matter where location has no effect when you getting tattered, teared
Or torn
Silent stare at the crowd and dare them on
I hold your dignity collateral then detonate prepare da bomb
Strictly legend status indeed expect
This ain't a verse, its my acceptance speech for you respect
And I wasn't born
Infact created on impact, combustion, spontaneous
Inject through lethal scent touch sight mic's clutched might leave a dent
Breakin records previously set by crumbs break a sweat

So I asked...... [Copywrite78]

Why would you choose to battle Tage when you average. [Tage*Proto]

And how could somebody of the opposite oppose Copywrite. [Copywrite78]

Why would you choose to battle Tage when you average. [Tage*Proto]

And how could somebody of the opposite oppose Copywrite. [Copywrite78]

We focus ????? lose sight, showin the motherfuckers what hip-hop's supposed to sound like

We're absotively posolutely sure we got the common rhyme at the bein time
We're absotively posolutely sure we got the common rhyme at the bein time

Yo, what up, ...MHz, ...Camu*Tao, ...Tage*Prototype, ...Copywrite MC
Bad Boy here we come
