[Verse 1: Illmac]
Yo, I murder tracks without thinkin'
While you nerds are learnin' at the scout meetin'
I'm burnin' grass like drought season
I shall teach 'em about leavin' the crowd screamin'
I does what I gotta do and don't allow beefin'
But nothin's impossible except livin' without breathin'
So if you run up I'll pop at you until your scalp's leakin'
And come to the hospital when you layin' down sleepin'
And snuffin' the doctor too and tellin' him, "Now treat him!"
I'm knockin' out thugs if they talkin' loud buzz
Rocky style, watch your mouth, 'cause I box without gloves
Cut 'em wide open, with a hunting knife, poke 'em!
I'm puffin' lye hopin' I can justify smokin'
Like in the old days, we lived in gold caves
Smoked J's and got so blazed, we called it "the stone age"
Get my drift? What I'm rappin' is cocaine
You can sniff my shit, yeah I'm packin' some flonase

[Hook: OnlyOne & Illmac]
A thoroughbred, yeah I'm sayin' that the world'll end
Before I take back a word I said
I'm a thoroughbred, yeah I meant every word I said
Why beg? I take what I deserve instead

[Verse 2: Copywrite]
[…] at me, I'm livin' crappy with no funds
No fun gettin' acky, I'm trigger happy with no gun
So beware of the vicious pit, hoes get near to kiss this dick
But ask me to eat the pussy and I'll pierce a bitch's clit
I'm here to get the chips: fat kid at a vending machine
Spendin' the green to my last cent 'til I split at the seams
The best MC, so testin' me
Is like expectin' to graduate college with F's and D's
I'm a product of Slick Rick, was brought up on Will Smith
Scarface, lines I write are narcotic so sniff sniff
I came in the game nice, like "Backgammon anyone?"
I'ma leave it mean as a demon backhandin' everyone
Pulled the baby 9 out, blew a lady's spine out
Shot once then got drunk with Amy Winehouse
[…] you a joke, I take grade A haze
Chronic, spray raid on it then I smoke it to a rope

[Hook: OnlyOne & Illmac]
A thoroughbred, yeah I'm sayin' that the world'll end
Before I take back a word I said
I'm a thoroughbred, yeah I meant every word I said
Why beg? I take what I deserve instead

[Verse 3: Illmac]
An awful cocky bastard, molly-whoppin' rappers
Miyagi karate master, watch your body fracture
I be boxin' faster than Muhammed Ali dodgin' jabs
Yeah, your jaw'll prob'ly shatter
I stood the test of time, you copied off my answers
Repeatin' what you hear like Polly wanna cracker
I hope your noggin rots of cancer
And your life flashes like paparazzi cameras
That spot accomplished actors
So move it back, I'm provin' that my crew can rap
A ruthless pack of sewer rats, you'll get chewed in half
Do the math, I tear that ass apart
Once the battle starts, you trapped in Jurassic Park after dark
Nah, I don't have to battle no more
My fist to the hammer of Thor, I lay you flat on the floor
I said nah, I don't gotta battle no more
My fist to the hammer of Thor, I lay you flat on the floor

[Hook: OnlyOne & Illmac]
A thoroughbred, yeah I'm sayin' that the world'll end
Before I take back a word I said
I'm a thoroughbred, yeah I meant every word I said
Why beg? I take what I deserve instead
