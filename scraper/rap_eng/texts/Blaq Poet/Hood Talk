If the hood can talk, the light … be talking to the benches
Yo I heard that the fences was snitching them niggers snitches
And what about the tree? That nigga been .. to life
Man hoes in him saying fuck the whole block
The garbage … city smell something funny
Niggers keep stashing their guns under me, over the money
It's always some shit, the building is whispering
The mail box got a big mouth, she always listening
The sidewalk is pissed cause everybody shit on him
And the playground think it's a game to … him
The cartable talking bout who's … gone
The sprinklers can't wait for the summer to turn it on
The grass …from the bushes
The grass is mad that the bush I filled with …
I sit back and I give a thought
What the fuck would they'd say, if the block can talk
Block talk block talk block talk
Hood talk, hood talk block talk hood talk
The chinese … is mad as the arabs cause they selling chickens too cutting in on they cash
The liquor store said he running the shit
And if that don’t cut it out everybody's getting hit
Even the rackses talking, they … with the squirrels tell them … walking
If the walls could talk it's going down
No more fakeness, check your backround
Hood talk, block talk just imagine that the hood came alive
I was … I wrote this, you had to nodes
This shit is so sick, so sick, so sick, so sick
