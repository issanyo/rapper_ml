[Verse 1: KRS-One]
KRS, Wild Style'n today
I stay controversial like Guatanamo Bay
My society is secret, sort of like the boulet
I'm not a average MC, I don't say what they say
I don't play what they play; I'm the type to find the needle
At the bottom of hay, that's why I'm rockin today
Often they say "No way!"
Until I say da-da-da-day and the crowd go HEY!
From the time I stepped in the game
Kris been clear 'bout his rep and his name
I don't tolerate disrespect to my name
To uplift my people that's the reason I came
If you believe in peace then we believe in the same
If you believe in war I got that TEC for your brain
If you think I'm a whore man you must be insane
I'm war in reverse like Big Daddy Kane - RAW!

[KRS] Wooo!

[Verse 2: Blaq Poet]
I know y'all motherfuckers ain't gon' believe this
Poet on the track with the nigga that dissed Queensbridge?
Let me show y'all how to bury the hatchet
The Blastmaster, with the Black Bastard, a classic (c'mon)
This is one for your dome
Niggas must understand it's hip-hop full blown!
Gimme the mic (what) I'mma stay shittin'
I'ma stay rippin' and banana clip spittin'
Niggas know, Blaq Po', green beret flow
It's nuttin' to me, I do it all day yo
The victory is almost here
I'm at the front line, yo Kris pull up on they rear (yeah)
We got the shit surrounded, time to wild out
Nigga what you wan' do, nigga don't ask me, this is your LP
Marley hollered at Preem, Preem hollered at me
Now I'm standin' here warrior, reppin QB
Nigga what's really good, what it's gon' be?

[KRS] Poet, rock on!

[KRS] Marley Marl whattup?!
{*Primo scratches: "The victory is almost there, just a little bit of.."*}

[Verse 3: KRS-One]
This ain't what you're used to
KRS-One, Marley Marl, BDP with the Juice Crew
Who knew? Twenty years after Scott
Marley Marl would pass the rock
And I'd dribble it, dribble it, livin' it
Nibble it a little bit before I enter the club and start killin' it
K-R-R-R-S-wah-wah-One
Yes they'd be the stars, me? I'd be the sun
Jump right off the stage, breakin' breakin' you off
KRS is the best, of c-c-c-course
Street to the c-core, down by l-law
You the number one MC? Oh shit, sure
Meet me at the c-club, if you thinkin' you thug
KRS and Poet, this the type of hip-hop you love!!

{*Primo scratches: "The victory is almost there, just a little bit of.."*}
[KRS] Marley Marl, Blaq Poet
{*Primo scratches: "The victory is almost there, just a little bit of.."*}
[KRS] You rocked it kid, you rocked it!
{*Primo scratches: "The victory is almost there, just a little bit of.."*}
