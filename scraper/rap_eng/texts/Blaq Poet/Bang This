[Verse 1]
Oh no, here I go again, it's Blaq Po' again
Niggas hoping and praying that I just throw it in
But I can't stop, I won't stop, I'm too thorough
Plus, none of ya niggas can give me any trouble
Yo thun, you outdid yourself, these niggas kid themselves
It's over for ya niggas, when this shit hits the shelf
You want hardcore? Here it is
24 7 year round like motherfucking Bill & Fizz
280, 6 1 , black as fuck
And I still ain't fighting fair, nigga keep the back 'em up
The game is out of order, niggas don't got no direction
Don't worry all I got this, bang me in every project
Got it locked down, north, south, east or west
On some real nigga shit, ya niggas know, Preem's the best
Don't even try to fight it, or start a fucking riot
I take the microphone and deep fry it, keep quiet
And as for drama nigga, don't even go there
Attack you with no fear, look at my eyes, I don't care
Everybody building up for a gang fight
Black jacks, big gats, motherfucking chain's nice
I know you're saying damn this bastard can flow
Ya motherfuckers must be orphans, the last ones to know

[Hook]
Bang this, motherfucker bang this
Take a slim wrist, I make you famous
Bang this, motherfucker bang this
If you're posted in the strip, if you're coasting in the whip
Bang this, motherfucker it's the shit
When you're high as a kite, and drunk with your clique
Bang this, bang this
Bang this motherfucker bang this

[Verse 2]
I turn on my radio, I cover my ears, I can't have it
Where the fuck is Red Alert? Where the fuck is Mr. Magic
Shit, I guess I got to get with the times
My mindstate is '88 but my style is '09
I'm sick with the rhymes like niggas sniffing some lines
Motherfuckers can't rap, got to stick with the crimes
Bang this, got nothing to hide, I'm shameless
A wild fucking animal, you can't tame this
OE guzzler, gats with the muffler
Stay on the grind, I'm a lifetime hustler
And Im'ma back up every fucking word
Leave you on the curb all fucked up, you heard
Bang this, motherfuck them bird niggas
On the real, you know how bad I hurt niggas
Blaq Poet, yeah I'm popping mad shit
It's in my blood, I'm on some really bad shit
It's nothing funny, I got dum dums for dummies
I'm a OG, but I'm getting that new money
This is a dead end, one way
Let's gun talk, gun play, everybody got to go one day
All that bullshit rose to the top
I'm like that cookie at the bottom of the pot
Nigga bang this
