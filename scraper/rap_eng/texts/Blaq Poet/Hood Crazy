[Intro]
Yo son man the motherfucking hood is crazy son
Niggas be wilding, yo
Bitches be acting up
Niggas don't want to listen
Let me tell you something
Little niggas running around with big ass guns and shit
Police is killing us left and right
It's just fucking crazy

[Sample: Scratches by DJ Premier]
"Hit me"

[Verse 1]
I went down last night watching these two chicks fight
One had a shank, one had a knife, they was going for life
Yo, I can't front, light skin had a fatty
But the chocolate one mad she fucked her baby daddy
These bitches making it hot, I'm starting to get mad
But I ain't breaking it up, I ain't trying to get stabbed
So I pulled out the 3 pound and bust off some shots
For one second they stopped and took it from the top
Now I got to breeze 'cause here come police
They're watching from the rooftop, now they're on me
The gun still hot, smoke coming out the barrel
Passed it off to my man and disappeared to the shadows
Made it all the way to the crib, changed my clothes
For an hour, laid low, and I'm back on the go
Can't stop, won't stop, got to move these bricks
This is life in the hood, no movie shit

[Hook]
The hood is crazy straight like that
Got the cops running around with yellow tape like brats

[Verse 2]
The hood is crazy, trust me when I tell ya
Getting chased by wild wolves one these niggas smell ya
I tried to school shorty, tried to tell him to listen
I know your family, they're Christian, you ain't got the thug vision
Plus, you ain't even old enough to buy a beer
So take my advice and get the fuck out of here
Or do you want to be gangster and get what a gangster gets
Look in the mirror, nigga, you're not 50 Cent
Don't be a fool, stay in school, don't do drugs
Little nigga looking at me like "you bugged?
How you gon' tell me what to do?
I learned the shit by looking out the window at you"
I said, "alright", that moment, my heart turned black
Looked him in the eyes and told him "You can't turn back
You are now, M.T.M., married to the mob
Any kind of street shit, no running to your moms
Just handle your business and don't be a baby
And remember when I told you that the hood is fucking crazy"

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Late night, crack fights, niggas throw dice
Broad daylight, on the scene, chicken, wings, and rice
Motherfuckers don't care if it's hot or cold
Motherfuckers don't care if it rains or snow
Some want to powder their nose, some hit the pipe
Some some the haze, drink Henny all night
Some don't do nothing, they just hang with the click
Those are the ones that mostly get innocently hit
The hood is crazy, you better believe it
Three hundred pound niggas turning all anemic
Welcome to hell, it's hell on earth, bad to worse
It's like being in the desert and you're dying from thirst
A young mother gives birth, she ain't ready, it hurts
Dump the baby in the dumpster and she gone on the first
I saw on the news, I saw the little tiny hearse
But all I can do is under my breath, curse ("shit")

[Hook]

"In the hood"
