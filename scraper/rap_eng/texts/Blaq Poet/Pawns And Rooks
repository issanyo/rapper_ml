[Intro: Blaq Poet]
Fuck the government
All around the world
What

[Verse 1: Blaq Poet]
Yo, you can't trust the government
What happened to the weapons of mass destruction
They went and bombed Saddam for nothing
They try to blame him for 9/11
Thousands of souls, sent to heaven
Now we in a war with Iraq
Full Metal Jacket soldiers not coming back
All these years looking for Bin Laden
Searching the mountains, what the fuck is really happening
Now we at a war with Afghanistan
Fucking with the Taliban, blowing up [?]
They only tell us what they want us to know
They'll never admit, they found a UFO
It's all mind control
Fuck the government yo, listen to Po
I only spit it how I see it
They trynna stop the Drug War? Ha, don't believe it
Cause if they really wanted to, they could stop it
But why would they, they make the biggest profit
They holding a brawl, they making a call
Blame it on Obama let that nigga take the fall

[Hook]
There's a million motherfuckers that be [?] and crooks
And the government is king, we just pawns and rooks
There's a million motherfuckers that be [?] and crooks
It's a, home of the brave, [?]

[Verse 2: Esoteric]
Another war you wanna settle the score
And build a bridge [?] to yours, I'm not having that
I'm fucking with it, I'm on my post-apocalyptic dystopian [?] slick shit crypting
[?] get their wigs split
Scumbag stockbrokers walk around like Mr. Big Dick
[?] rigged it, idiots
Blessing the lord
Makes about as much sense as dudes investing in Ford
Or Toyota
Nuclear weapons shoot through your [?]
A beautiful mess and who you testing go to school, get a lesson
Cause life is truly a blessing so move with a [?]
We know what's in the [?] of recession
It's pawns and rooks
It's what we are there's no such thing, as honest crooks
But the songs we put, on paper
Deserve the strongest look
Word is bond, it's E.S
East Coast Avengers what, motherfucker keep your mouth shut

[Hook]
There's a million motherfuckers that be [?] and crooks
And the government is king, we just pawns and rooks
There's a million motherfuckers that be [?] and crooks
It's a, home of the brave, [?]

[Verse 3: Akir]
Bet I can [?], but I see coffins
I see it often, unfortunate orphans
Displaced they [?], live in the streets
I feed off them, man deliver my piece
They say be truth and decypher it deep
It still succumb to the government cheats
Sneak through laws when the town hall meets
We in the city and we can not sleep
CCTV with cops all [?]
Rodney King [?] in a cell like [?]
Getting new weapons show, here's the heat [?]
[?], sucks to be shot
Out of extra ordinary mortuaries
Let's get live before a portion that [?] bury
[?] 80 if you drive a new Mercedes
Or you walking with your babies
[?] the skies before it's [?]

[Hook]
There's a million motherfuckers that be [?] and crooks
And the government is king, we just pawns and rooks
There's a million motherfuckers that be [?] and crooks
It's a, home of the brave, [?]
