[Hook]
Beat you down

[Verse 1]
Listen up world as the Poet attacks
This is just a little sample of how I wax
BDP is trying to dis, we know that they're on it
Every time we make a record, they get disappointed
Nobody said Hip Hop started out in the Bridge
But you dissed all of Queens now we know how you live
You're trying to get paid talking 'bout my town
When I battle you punk I'mma beat you down

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
How can you say the Bridge is over? We've just begun
You soft sucker MC, KRS-One
Can you believe it, party people? He raps like a rasta
Boogie Down Productions are full of imposters
They say things that are not true
Now the Poet and Noel will break it down for you
Yes Bronx started Hip Hop, but didn't maintain it
Now they're getting jealous cause Queens has made it
That's why those suckers are trying to dis
Because we're getting paid and they're getting pissed
Just think about it people, I'm speaking the facts and
Manhattan keeps making it, Queens do the taxing
My name is Poet, for the top I'm bound
Anybody in my way is getting beat down

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Now back in the days when Hip Hop began
Queens was rocking with the hardest jams
Over there in the Bronx you jammed with house speakers
We was rocking bass bottoms, and JBL tweeters
Bound up and down, Richard Long bound
Was Infinity Machine and Nu Sounds
You say that the Bronx is rocking the place
When you just got put on to sub bass
Man, the old school, they used to duel
And of course Nu Sounds was the ones who ruled
The Infinity Machine taking out power
Ever since the days you been all on ours
Yes we had the jams that was worth a lot
I know you remember when the Bertha rocked
With the bass so low, it shook the ground
Man, even back then we was beating you down

[Hook]

[Verse 4]
KRS One, you sound like a sissy
You want to battle me, yo let's get busy
Battles I enjoy, they improve our tactics
I'm telling you now, you're purely practice
And if you want to fight, put down your mic
And we will lock ass for the whole damn night
You can get your whole crew, but don't swing arms
Cause I'm knocking down posses with my pythons
I don't need bodyguards, cause this boy's bad
And Noel got my back with the 45 Mag
So come on and roll, so we can get buck
This is one MC that don't give a fuck
Don't ever let me hear you say Queens is soft
We'll be rolling to the Bronx with sawed-offs
Yes Bronx created Hip Hop, I'll give you that
But you're also the creators of the drug called crack
You thought we didn't know, you thought we forgot
Everybody in your crew has beamed up to scott
I know you want to battle from the things I said
Just remember Poet will put out that head
Beat down!

[Hook]

[Verse 5]
I know that you're mad because we got loose
But you tried to dis Marley and Sir Juice
Just remember, we know how you're playing a game
You're trying to get fame off Marley's name
Just take this advice from Noel and Poet
Stop trying to dis Queens and get off the tip
Yes me and Noel will be back to crush
You will never leave Bronx if you ever dis us
You don't like what I said, you don't like how I sound
Just battle me boy so I can beat you down

[Hook]
