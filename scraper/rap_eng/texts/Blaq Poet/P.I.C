[INTRO]
Huh
What ?
Huh, yo!

[VERSE 1] [Blaq Poet]

I go hard - MMA type rap! (ha)
You can tap out, or you can fight back
You're dealing with a dangerous mind, sometime
?                           ?       designes all kind of rhymes
I've been going for mine, I've been dealing with hate
I've been feeling that love. (Love) generate all the power
From my thugs up above
??? gentleman- flip to a thug
Ice ? motherfucker- Screwball mog
I come from the bottom- bars I got em'
They know Blaq Poet's a problem
I ain't playing no games. (No!)
Can't lock me down, I break out the chains. (rrrrraaaaaa!)
Tell me who want beef ?
I'll give it to you well done, more than one piece
? you, cut you, slice you, shake ya
Punk ass niggas I know bitches that's more gangsta

[Chorus] [Blaq Poet]

P.I.C : Partners In Crime
Poetic comet through the darkness we shine!
*through the darkness we shine x2* (over scratches)

[VERSE 2] [Comet]

To my hood nigga, who harder when/where ?? feel foul
When they murder my s?. This is what's become
When you live in the slums, money over friendship
Live burns when the train come police come late (late)
Niggas die, bleed and Satan in the slum misleading em'
Early from a young, see
Corrupt their mind, all they know is hustling, gun
T? me, mugging, ready to hit something
This how it is when you based in hell
?                   commit a murder right out the shadows
Bullets ? tissus, as they rip through you
You either make it or you die trying
New York know what it do
Get money on dead rivals
Mad men,  ?  , song called survival

[Chorus] [Blaq Poet] (x2)

P.I.C : Partners In Crime
Poetic comet through the darkness we shine!
*through the darkness we shine x2* (over scratches)
