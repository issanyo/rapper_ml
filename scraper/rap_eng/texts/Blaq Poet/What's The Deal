[Hook 2x: Scratches by DJ Premier]
"What's the Deal"
"What's the Deal"
"What's the Deal"
"What up Premo man"

[Verse 1]
I ain't no pimp, I ain't no motherfucking baller
I ain't no motherfucking player nigga
I'm a real motherfucking rhyme sayer nigga
Don't get it fucked up, I still will lay a nigga
Now look, I don't give a fuck about nothing
Straigt ignorant nigga, got a dagger to digging a nigga
Too much motherfucking Queensbridge in the nigga
Too much Hennessy and weed up in the nigga
Blaq Po', niggas already know what it is
Whoever the top dog is, I'm going for his
Point blank, period, off with his wig
No hesitations, no negotiations
You ain't know I take this rap shit serious
No gimmicks and dumb shit, no silliness
I hold the steel, shit is not a game, it's real
If looks can kill, Oooh, how the pain will feel

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
It go, fee, fi, fo, fum
I smell mad pussy in this industry, thun
None of these niggas can get with me, thun
They be fumbling, can put the clip in their gun
Tripping over beats while I bob and weave them
Niggas want a breeze from rap, who needs them?
I send shots at niggas for no reason
And the rest of y'all might as well make plans on leaving
The more I go, the beats get harder
Words get sharper, skies get darker
Blaq Poet, the eye of the tiger
Niggas acting tough, they bitch like Mariah
I can't believe ya think ya illing
Ya niggas ain't villains, ya twinkie fillings
Now me, I got that real raw shit
Kick in the door, go to war shit
It's on

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
No you might not know what to do with this
'Cause ya been hypnotized by all that foolish shit
Be easy, take it slow, let it marinate
Then it's gonna hit ya, I hope I didn't get you late
I got the dangerous flow with the bangingest beats
For my niggas locked down and playing in the streets
Pour out a little liquor
For the niggas that ain't here to wild out with ya
This is hip-hop 3rd degree
Must have the ability to burn MC's
I came here strictly to catch some wreck
That nigga Preem got some beats to blast your neck
Year Round Records, that's the deal
Make real street music, rap for real
I'm not a prophet, but here's a prediction
When I'm through, you'll have a Poet addiction
