[Verse 1:Blaq Poet]

I’m non-stop hip-hop, Blaq Poet is a fucking beast
Spit lyrics like that gun and I come in peace
Me and my guns, we running this fucking streets
Y’all niggas is pussy, don’t stand in front of me
I represent the streets with my hard rhymes
I represent my niggas going hard times
Y’all soft niggas come late when it’s trouble
You hate when I bubble, can’t relate to my struggle (nope)
The music you make proves you a dud
I leave y’all niggas laying in a pool of blood
Y’all not on my level, I leave you in the dust
I’ll leave you with your people all broke up and crushed
This is that shit that they fiend for
The uncut raw is what they pay the green for
They say that these are the last days
In that case, yo, I’m going on a rampage

[Hook:Wais P]

You don’t wanna play with these here niggas
Cuz these here niggas walk around with hair triggers
And old school caddies, new Benzes with the navi
If you do it for your hood nigga show me where your hands be

[Verse 2:Wais P]

Rubber band rap, my money slap
My snow bunnies tell ‘em shake it off
Then buy your fur just to take it off
I’m making off with your life savings, Bernie Madoff
Niggas try to scam the same corner that I ate off
The difference is, ain’t no mimicking, this is pimpin’ shit
Crocodile lizard shit, Send ho's in a blizzard shit
Flow, rare isn’t it, I dare you to visit this
I rip and tear limitless, it ain’t fair, you’re finished kid
Wais P the business, Greek god, call me Icarus
You’re flying too close to the sun
Get your wings burned off, flame blown out and turned off
You’re playing chicken with us, semi truck you need to turn off
My pimp crew colder, so many minks and furs
Next year we rock koala bear and polar
Shitting on you, when it’s on I come through spraying
Like homeboy from Tucson, Arizona

[Hook:Wais P]

You don’t wanna play with these here niggas
Cuz these here niggas walk around with hair triggers
And old school caddies, new Benzes with the navi
If you do it for your hood nigga show me where your hands be
