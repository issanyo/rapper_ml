[VERSE 1]
Up early in the morning
Looking for another way
Thank God for another day
Police on the news
Shootin niggas again
Hope its nobody I know
Or my next of kin

What the fuck they wanna do
Kill us all off slow
Make it so - we can’t walk through the hood no mo

Tip toe through the ghetto
Gotta think fast
Just going to the store
Might be your last (nigga)

That’s how it is
When you’re living in the hood
In they eyes - everybody’s no good

Gotta live your life - surrounded by trife
Playing cats and mice - every day throw the dice
They not giving a fuck
Every day - police locking niggas up

They care less about you - about me
Once you in a cage - throw away the key
Ass out - with no support
Just how they want it - a nigga going to court

Thinking of a master plan for a way out
Five in the morning - bullets getting sprayed out
Don’t ask me why - niggas just wildin
There’s room on the streets - but there’s none on the island

Judge giving out time to the newcomers
No second chances - football numbers
You gotta do what you gotta do
Family gotta eat - baby need new shoes

And it ain’t no jobs
Gotta hit the streets
Gotta go hard

I ain’t mad at ya
I just don’t wanna hear
That the man got ya

Its too many ways to get trapped up
So don’t act up - don’t get racked up
Be on point when you on the grind
Keep a low pro - don’t try to shine
Get money - stack doe - get paper
And stay away from those no good haters
