[DJ Premier]
This is a public service announcement
Yeah, to ban the word, nigga, ho, bitch, uh huh
So, let's have a discussion, let's talk about it
See what the hip-hop community, the streets, the hood, feel about this shit right here

[Intro]
DJ Premier: Yo Poet, how do you feel about that shit, man?
Blaq Poet: Mind your motherfucking business. This is hood shit, hip-hop shit

[Verse 1: Blaq Poet]
Now how the fuck you gon' tell us what to say?
We live with niggas and bitches and hoes everyday
Now if I call my nigga my nigga, that's how we talk
If I call some ho a bitch, that's how she walks
Now if I say it on records, than that's how it go
Would you let your kids sit back and watch porno? No
So don't blame it on me cause little Susie
Want to shake what her momma gave her, sell crack to the neighbors
Jesse, you're a player, and Oprah, you're a fucking hater
And here's a middle finger for New York's finest
Click, clack, blaow, hold that Don Imus
They try to say what we say is negative
But there's a war going on in Iraq that's killing kids
I say what I say, I spit how I spit it
Hip-hop brought more races together than the Olympics
We got white boys with braids, Chinese with waves
That ain't the fucking Jim Crow days
So shut the fuck up and get off our dick
And don't worry if I say you's a nigga, ho, bitch

[Sample]
"Come here"

[DJ Premier]
Psst, what up

[Verse 2: Panchi]
There's a war going on outside, it's like a virus
We're getting attacked by Sharpton and Imus
And Harpo acting like she numb
Ho get a couple dollars, bitch forget where she from
I scream nappy headed ho with immunity, you crazy
A strong black woman raised me
Whipped my ass, in the shape to drop jewels on a baby
And that's why the God ain't lazy
You mad at us now? Come on, my nigga
Jesse Jackson even said it for show, my nigga
At the Source Awards to a round of applause
And I know he rehearsed before he said that curse
And so did I, suck a dick and die
Got a political angle cause your career's in a tangle
Try to fuck with my label, take food off my table
That's brother against brother, like Cain and Abel

[Sample]
"Good god, a whole lot of niggas here today"
"Look at here, you motherfuckers came in a bunch, did you"

[Verse 3: Shabeeno]
They say hip-hop is dying, don't believe that, pa
Long as Preem making beats, I know CPR
R.A.W., no other way to give it to you
Looked up to you, but now I got to shit on you
Russ, it was good when you was eating off of shit like
"Niggas better get it right, bitches better get it right"
Explicit lyrics, Im'ma say what I wanna
Al and Russell wants to bump their heads in a sauna
Trying to control what I write, censor my mic
Want to stereotyped if you live my life
If you came where I come from, then y'all already know
A lady from a bitch probably know a couple hoes
So you ain't gonna Imus me, Bill O'Reilly me
Can't send cop to us to 2 Live Crew us
Al, you're bugging, concentrate on the trial
Make sure they rot in the cell for what they did to Sean Bell
Motherfuckers

[Sample]
"Why you want to fuck with me, nigga?"
"Bitch this, bitch that, nigga this, nigga that
In the mean while my pockets are gettin fat"
"Shit, somebody get this nigga off of me"
