[Sha Stimuli]:
The antagonist, bad guy
Call me the anti, super hero
Although I can't fly, I can't die
The streets pressure me, but I won't let them Heath Ledger me
A Joker that's focused, your worst enemy
I tell the judge, go ahead and sentence me
I tried to save the game but I got homicidal tendencies
I was trying to provide for people
Now I switched side, Darth Vader, Dr. Evil
Lex Luger, Magneto, spitting that Venom
Scarecrow with a rare flow, swear I'm just beginning
I don't care if you show support, I hold the fort
Down, Lord Voldemort, .44 across town
Put the fear into good guys, look I was found
I was lost, used to rap, now I talk underground
But I pop, if I gotta, make sure that you drown
In the mainstream, hate me or hand me the crown
Sha!

[Reef The Lost Cauze]:
You'll get fucking killed
You ain't fucking built
You need to do some more reps, drink some muscle milk
That just sound gay
I let a round spray
Life is beautiful but you wanted a downgrade
Not a sound made
All you hear is thump
I don't understand your language, all I hear is chump
Tell that bitch to jump, ja jump
Makaveli in the trunk we bumping 'Hit Em Up'
When We Ride On Our Enemies
Niggas in the grass, on your like a centipede
Caterpillar, don't matter nigga the brain splatter nigga
Masta Killa, word to the Killa Bees
And The Chef too
Peep the next move
Put this machete, steadily to where your neck move
And if that isn't enough to see victory
I'll light you the fuck up like a Christmas tree
You kidding me
