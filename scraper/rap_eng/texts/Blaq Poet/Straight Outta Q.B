[Verse 1 Cormega]
Straight outta Queensbridge
A crazy motherfucker named Cormega
In a viper chromed out beyond measure
I got your girl and a sterling
Automatic that'll have your ass twirling
Niggas know if they ever fuck with me
The police gonna have to come get me off your ass
I don't really give a fuck
Bitch Motherfucker, I'll severely hit you up
Niggas wanna mumble when I come through
Iceberg jeans and Ice coming out the sleeves
Showing off on a motherfucker like that
Cause I'm a hustler slash rapper
Life's a bitch my gunsmoke will make you catch cancer
Nigga I rep the streets til I rest in peace
If you wanna bring your vest and heat
My projects will be the last place you ever see
So when you're in my neighborhood, you better duck
Cormega is crazy as fuck
When it's on, your ass better mean it
Cause when I turn bad boy
I'm coming straight outta Queensbridge

Poet is his name

[Verse 2 Poet]
And my thunns come
Sraight outta Queensbridge
The foulest nigga out in the bridge
Piss in your Tropicana put it back in the fridge
New niggas signed to punk
Hell no they can't live
What the fuck you think this shit is, Thanksgive?
Now let's get right back to how foul I am
Nobody knows how foul I am
Scratch my balls, then shake your hand
Gas a girl to fuck on me and my man
I do what the fuck I want because I can
Niggas try to front, the guns go BLAM!
Back in the days when coke was 20 a gram
I was the nigga selling soap for 50 a gram
And I was the nigga working in your hallway
Radio blasting early morning Sunday
Crackheads lined up
Old ladies dressed up
Praise the lord, chill y'all
I know that's messed up
But I'm the foulest of the foul
The wildest of the wild
Shitting on niggas King Kong style
Y'all don't like it, then don't buy it
Can't stand the heat in the kitchen?
Bounce bitch cause I'm wired
My whole clique been on some shit
Mentally sick
Taking niggas ice and they're new Bentley whip
Mothers they come around
Don't give your baby mothers shit
Now just how foul can foul get?
Straight outta Queensbridge

Ayyo Jungle [Yo]
Tell em where you from

[Verse 3 Jungle]
Straight outta Queensbridge
I'm selling crack to a pregnant mother
And make her daughter think I love her
The gutter is real
Fiends move fast on the hill
Broad daylight gats do peel
(so what about the bitch who got shot?) fuck it
You really think a nigga give a fuck when I'm bucking?
You stupid bitch I bang out no remorse
Then the very next day, I floss
With the whole hood hot, D's going nuts
Niggas I grew up with scared to say "what up"
When I walk by you can see the blood in my eye
Staying thug til I die
Smoke bud to get high
Yo, that's how my brave heart turned cold
Nigga fuck the judge, fuck his robe
Fuck parole
And motherfuck the globe and I fucked your ho
You ain't know?
I'm straight outta Queensbridge
