Let's getitin, let's get it on, I was born for this shit
The adrenaline is on, and the mic's gettin ripped
You can look and you can search, but you can't find this
I'm qb farness, call me ya highness
I'm ready to kill ya, niggas, is up for real
Yo niggas on front, you can touch

I was always hardcore, standing in the cut nigga, ready for war
Really had an AK, really had a tech?
All type to shit the take yo'head off your neck
Better show respect when a nigga come true
Mic check, one two, I mess the gun-fu
I'm here to slap the taste
You ain't hip hop nigga, you a disgrace
Attack from all angles
Use the mic cord to strangle and hang you
I mean what I say
Me, I don't play, get the fuck out my way
Rap renegade, special forces
Goin' at the bosses, I'm takin' no losses

Oyo beats, c'mon

(rit.)x4
Aaaaa aaa a aaa, we got to deal with it
You know the deal

Tell me what the fuck are y'gonna do
Just deal with it, I'm too for real with it, I'm too ill with it
Yo niggas don't have a chance, it's all over
Niggas shootin' at the ambulance, call a corner

My niggas is all over ya, we screwballin' ya
I'm relentless, handlin' business
.Don't stop 'til I'm finished, I flow with the sickness
I'm comin' at ya niggas, signed ways

Rappers get slaved, when they come my way
You only get one shot, but all you gonna do is gettin' scraped off the block
All you gonna do is gettin' popped and chopped

Trust me, I do this for life, I'm too high
Givin' all I got, 'til I reach the top
You know I speak correct, I'm keepin runnin back
And that's a fuckin' fact, ya nigga's fuckin wack

You rollin' with the russian , you know my gunz bust
You gettin' left in the ust, crushed and putted on hush
Blaq Poet is the ultimate knight, I, niggas, know exactly what a nigga is fuckin' with
