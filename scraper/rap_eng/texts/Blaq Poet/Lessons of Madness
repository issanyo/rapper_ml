[VERSE 1: Blaq Poet]
Baby is born in the belly of the beast
Looking to eat the first option the streets
Daddy ain’t there - mommy on drugs
Sister in the streets - so he running with the thugs

What else he could do - but fuck it get money
Ain’t nothing funny - when you broke looking bummy
Running around with the gun - till the jig is up
Screw facing everybody - and sticking niggas up

That lifestyle won’t last long
Somebody gonna pull your card
And that’s the last song

Better find another hustle quick
Police is on you and they looking
To bust your shit

The hood is like the black hole
Trying to suck you in yo
Listen to Black Rob WHOA

I speak the truth
I’ll never lie to ya
I get high with ya
Always ride with ya

Real nigga for life - no question
Listen up good - when I’m teaching life’s lesson

[Chorus]
These jewels in life
You need to take heed to
Never bite the hand that feed you
It’s the evil
Sins of man - that cause the world sadness
Mass destruction - lessons of madness

These jewels in life
You need to take heed to
Never bite the hand that feed you
It’s the evil
Sins of man - that cause the world sadness
Mass destruction - lessons of madness

[VERSE 2]
It’s time for lesson number two
All the females in the world
This one’s for you

Don’t be a little hottie
You gotta respect your body
Fuck what Nikki say
Don’t try to be a Barbie

Try to be a Michelle Obama - no drama
Make momma smile - then make a proud papa
Cause the streets will chew you up - and spit you out
And show you what being in a trap - is all about

Keep your legs closed and stay in your zone
I’m dropping these jewels on you - like you was my own

I watch pretty princesses’ lose they glow
Laying up with scumbags - and dudes they don’t know

I’m telling you this girl - just to save your life
So you could be a good mom - or somebody’s wife
Or you could be a hoochie - or you could be a hoe
Or somebody’s bitch - walking up and down the stroll

[Chorus]
These jewels in life
You need to take heed to
Never bite the hand that feed you
It’s the evil
Sins of man - that cause the world sadness
Mass destruction - lessons of madness

These jewels in life
You need to take heed to
Never bite the hand that feed you
It’s the evil
Sins of man - that cause the world sadness
Mass destruction - lessons of madness

[VERSE 3: Ruste Juxx]
This is a story about a kid with big dreams
To blow up on the rap scene by any means
The devil got you when you sold your soul
It ain’t no coming back cause the world is cold

He had a good upbringing
Private school - going to college
But when it came to himself
He had no knowledge

He loved gangsta rap
And that’s all he rhymed about
Lying saying he was a killer
In every line about
Major drug dealing - and niggas he shot dead
Banging at the cops - on the block
When he got bread

Like a sheep in wolf’s clothing
But you know real goons is
Good for exposing - clowns like him
And the shit wasn’t pretty
He started getting robbed
And beat up in every city
But come back nah I seriously doubt that
He wanna shout that - but he ain’t really bout that

[Chorus]
These jewels in life
You need to take heed to
Never bite the hand that feed you
It’s the evil
Sins of man - that cause the world sadness
Mass destruction - lessons of madness

These jewels in life
You need to take heed to
Never bite the hand that feed you
It’s the evil
Sins of man - that cause the world sadness
Mass destruction - lessons of madness
