[VERSE 1]
Count Blaqula - coming with my henchmen
Bunch of mother fuckers
Do you dirty like a pig pen

Now do you really want some of this
Why take the risk
Your eye meets the fist

Got love for my niggas in France
Wildin in Paris - see you when I land

Get high - get drunk all night
When it comes to this shit
I got it all locked tight

I beat up the beat
Like Mayweather would
Fuck the bullshit nigga
I’m forever hood

Stay sharp on my craft
Never lettin up
Footin on your neck
Till blood start spitting up

I do things for Queens
I rep that shit
Don’t make it a murder scene

Everybody wanna be hard
Trying to be thug
Get slapped in your face
Trying to mean mug

I’m still flipping
It just won’t cease
I’m forever beast
I’m forever streets
