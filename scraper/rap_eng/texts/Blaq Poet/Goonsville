[Verse 1: Blaq Poet]
Blaq Poet
Wilding with the usual suspectz
I bust TECS, running with the goons and roughnecks
I'm here to get it in, and take the shit again
Not your regular rapper, rhyming and Ritalin
I'm on the rampage every damn day
No room for your bitch motherfuckers you can't stay
'fuck outta here, hit the ground running
You no it ain't nuttin, I'm dumbin', dramas coming
Maniac on the mic, psychopath, I go first, I go last
Still rip shit in half (don't matter)
I'm here to read forever, I ain't leavin'
Hundred miles per hour, speeding, fire breathing
I'm the monster under your bed
Keep the light on, if you sleep on me you dead
All the critics talk that I'm too mean
Or maybe it's the way I hot spit a sixteen

[Hook x2]
This is Goonsville
In the hood where my dudes spill
If you don't already know then you soon will
This is Goonsville
Where them tools kill
Another random body on the newsreel

[Verse 2:]
?? star of the ghetto, so don't let the heart settle
Start braking and pumping like a car pedal
I pass more of them rocks than Carmello
Looking like a filled up my bags with marshmallows
Looking like i filled up the mag with D-Batteries
Then automatically, i foresee tragedy
And if you battle me peace to a Blaq Poet
You get smacked, and if you listen to the track (know it)
Better call your boys, fuck it call the Navy in
Cause you faggots is softer than baby skin
Fuck around, throw your body in the landfill
So if my records don't sell then your grams will
Gotta stand still, when i aim and shoot
With that metal in my hand like I'm playing flute
Get your hands up, i don't mean raise the roof
Show me bunny ears son I'ma take your loot

[Hook x2]

[Verse 3:]
Snowgoons and Suspectz were made to kill
Our words'll get you cut off like
Unpaid electric bills, my set has skills
Better than i said before
So when I'm in the hood i stay lower than my credit score
I measure more, i keep my eyes wide open
Forever in the war, on the front line smoking
Gladiator in a Colosseum it's the honest way
Live and die by the sword and i let the options weigh
Stop and say, you know I'm gonna fight hard
I got to war with my hands, ?giving/given/getting? punches like a time card
And yes I rhyme bars like lifers in the night yard
The product that i push get you wet like a life guard
NFS, Blaq Poet, Goons on the beat
Never rest for a moment, still stand on my feet, words of defeat
Never this is our time, so i made my point like Chris Paul at the foul line

[Hook x2]
