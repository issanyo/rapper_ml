[Intro]
Hoo Han

[Verse 1]
Rhyme flow dangerous, 30 plus, never rust
Niggas can not hang with it, it's like being hit with a fucking bus
I hear ya niggas talking, tell me what the fuck ya smoking
Blaq Poet, don't provoke him, Henny drinking, haze blowing
Gun-toting bastard, what the fuck ya want to do
I swear I'll blow at ya niggas, that's word to Kenny Lou (KL)
Keep it a hundred, I'm the best that never done it
Niggas want to give me the crown and I don't even want it
What I do want is for you punks to pay attention
Ain't nothing wrong with that kiddy shit, but this what's been missing
Premo on the beat and me on the rhyme
That means it's heat on the streets, it's about that time

[Hook]
I get it in, for all my thuns that's not here
For those whom I shed tears and ran with for years
I get it in, for New York, true talk, nigga
We the best, what the fuck you thought?
I get it in

[Sample]
"Yeah Kid"

[Blaq Poet]
Hold up hold up, hold the fuck up Premo

[DJ Premier]
Po' what up?

[Blaq Poet]
Yo
Hold up, hold up

[Sample]
"Go in, go in"

[Verse 2 (w/ DJ Premier)]
Ya here to witness, niggas got no choice but to blast this
Hip-hop resurrected, I rise from the ashes
And you know, Blaq Po' is like a submachine
It ain't a fucking thing to blow your ass to smithereens
I'm on some Queen shit, "bridge" shit, mean shit
What other nigga makes this ill, gangster lean shit? (I don't know)
What other nigga makes you just want to get it in? (I don't know)
What other nigga drink that gin on top of Henn? (I don't know)
What other nigga make that real hard shit
Make them other niggas make all that bottom bar shit
Let them other niggas run around and chase them hoes
I let them other niggas run around in them tight ass clothes
Let them other niggas sit back and think they came
Let them other niggas talk about their whips and blings
I'm from the streets, motherfucker, and I'm really hood
So don't make me do it to you 'cause I really could

[Sample]
"Yeah kid"
"You not an MC, you's a rapper"
"Go in, go in"

[Hook]
I get it in, for all my thuns that ain't here
For those who I shed tears and ran with for years
I get it in, for New York, true talk, nigga
We the best, what the fuck you thought
I get it in, for all my thuns that ain't here
For those who I shed tears and ran with for years
I get it in, for New York, true talk, nigga
We the best, what the fuck you thought
I get it in

[Verse 3]
I splatter your matter nigga, you never mattered
All over the block, niggas need to stop with all that chit chatter
Yo fuck these niggas, y'all fake as niggas
See me and you smiling in my face as niggas
Snake ass niggas, don't think I see you slithering
How stupid can you be when you know I fucking get it in
I let you get closer, then I put this close you
Leave your ass in Nova Scotia, stiff where nobody knows ya
Gangster kaiser, the mac light your night up
I sit back and light up, them things tear you right up
Oh I love it when a plan comes together
When my hand touch the cheddar, feed your mans to the shredder
I get it in

[Outro]
Hoo han
Yeah motherfuckers
Straight gutter shit
(What up)
Blaq Poet
(Year Round)
DJ Premier
The game is over
It's ours
We the hardest
We the best
(NYGz nigga)
Uh
Free Rave Roulette
