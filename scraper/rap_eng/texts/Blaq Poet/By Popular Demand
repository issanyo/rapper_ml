"Scaring motherfuckers like Stephen King flicks"
"Back for all you suckers"
"Got that shit for y'alls people to rock to"

[Verse 1: Apathy]
Been a renegade since 2nd grade
Fuck a lemonade stand, sold the blood from the men I slayed
I'm mopping up the stage you can smell the brains
Heart full of Hell's rage, time to load the 12 gauge
Satan's sober I don't even need the Belvedere
I can smell this jealousy like a dog can smell your fear
Fully blacked out, strategy mapped out
Lucifer's jealous he was the reason he was cast out
You can smell the Hatorade, the juices
The judgements of Jesus, jack moves by Judas
Benny Blanco plotting on Carlito
You trying to be Michael when you less than Tito
I'm sick of the delusional, sick of your sore ego
Fuck licking shots, here's the tip of the torpedo
I gave birth to your bitch ass and you can quote it
If I never told 'em your name then nobody would know it
