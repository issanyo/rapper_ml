[Verse 1]
It's Blaq Po' I'm on a killing spree
Y'all niggas gonna remember me
Warlord, hardcore, goin' down in history
Nigga ain't no mystery
The .44 guarantees a flawless victory
Y'all niggas ain't shit to me
I got the skills to lyrically crush you
I got them things that reach out and touch you
Viciously fuck you up, something horrible
Let Lil Wayne and T-Pain keep playing in the carnival
While I rebuild this rap shit from scratch, kid
I got the Blaqprint, this shit is like crack, kid
I make you want it more
Got you searching on the floor
Got you climbing up the walls
Who hears? Who ball?
Nobody coming harder than me
Every day, getting more harder to see
Follow a G
Cus I'm parting the sea
Who want drama with me?
You might aswell point the llama at your college squeeze

[Hook]
This shit ain't no joke
This shit is pure dope
Be easy, young blood
Careful, young folk
It's getting rough now
Niggas all hush now
Tiptoeing around
Trying not to get shook down

[Verse 2]
The more bars I spit the more barbaric it get
The more blood drip, flooding the public
My niggas hugging the strip, this for yall niggas
Get that money, watch them unmarked cars niggas
And for the rest of you lames just pay attention
My name is in flames, stop your complaining and bitching
I'm murdering main competition trigger finger itching
I'm so ill it's sickening, like E pills and mixing
Who ever wanted? What, what? I'm still on it, still
Red eye blunted, still keep it 100
Rip the book bag off you backpackers
And smack the shit outta all you whack rappers
I got screwy-Louie, cave-milly running through me
I'm possessed by all the Queensbridge fallen goonies
It's about to get ten times worse
Got the haze for my head, and the henny for my thirst
I won't stop until the end of my days
I'm like double your age in a rage running craz'

[Hook]

"I told y'all little niggas, don't fuck with me but you wanna fuck with a nigga, right? I tried to be a good motherfucking nigga but I can't be because little bitch ass niggas wanna fuck with me. You want to fuck with a nigga, right? You want a nigga who got two stripes on him to go to jail for life!"
