[Intro: DJ Premier]
KL
Yo, we gonna miss you, nigga

[Verse 1: Blaq Poet]
Yo, I'll never forget this black day
Premo calling me on a 3-way with Marley
Telling me my thun ain't here no more
Telling me to be strong, I just got the call
I hung up, I had to hit the thun line
Dez picked it up, in his voice, he was crying
He confirmed it, I sat back stunned
Thinking about my aunt, who was her only son
Thinking about my moms, that was her favorite nephew
Thinking about his sons and all the shit that they didn't get to do
Thinking 'bout how we supposed to ride out
And turn this whole rap shit inside out
He was my baby brother, he was my little cousin
He was my best friend, as little niggas, we was bugging
Running around Big Ma's house
169th and Liberty, [?]
I've been down since the day you died
We been through it all, I never can say goodbye

[Hook: Scratches by DJ Premier]
"Never goodbye"

[Verse 2: Blaq Poet]
I remember as kids, you used to come to the Bridge
I used to go to Far Rock, two lil' hard rocks
[?], that was your block
Even though you had asthma, that wouldn't make you stop
Nigga played football, baseball, basketball
Loved to ride your bike and playfight in the hall
Dave in the building, Richie in the building
Rest in peace Willie, I know you two chilling
Along with my pops, Uncle Charles and Uncle Fuzzy
Big Ma, say what's up to your pops, Uncle Lonnie
Im'ma miss the way you used to laugh
I'm crying out as I write this paragraph
Tears drop on the paper, the pen smears through it
Reminiscing about the day we used to do it
A real nigga that did real things
You always held your people down by any means
It's so crazy, I won't even lie
KL, by my right eye, it's never goodbye

[Hook]
