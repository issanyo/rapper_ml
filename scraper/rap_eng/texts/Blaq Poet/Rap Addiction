Yo, this shit is so addicting, you heard?
I'm in recovery right now
Been in recovery for about 30 minutes
Fuck that recovery shit
Yo Preem, let's get high

[Intro: Shabeeno]
I've been an addict since the Microphone Fiend got me high
I had no defense, I ain't been sober since
It got it bad, the monkey on my back got the shakes
Make no mistakes, I need drums and breaks
A bassline I can ride on, get my high on
Gangster lean, I'm who the world got their eyes on
Mr. Relapse, be spitting raps to the youth
I know I'm the truth, I hold meetings in the booth
Like Bishop on the roof, I'm a falling star
I ain't learned 12 steps, keep 16 bars
[?] on the chase, dog, I can't slow down
I'm in the mix, I need my fix, and my flow got bounce
Ten Crack Commandments, I ain't reached five
Cause your boy stay high on his own supply
The rap shit's addictive, I can't let go
Think I'm going back to rehab, no, no, no

[Hook: Scratches by DJ Premier]
"I'm just an addict, addicted to music"
"I gotta use it"
"Most notable, hip-hop quotable"
"Get biz on the mic like back in the days"
"I'm just an addict, addicted to music"
"I gotta use it"
"Most notable, hip-hop quotable"
"Get biz on the mic"

[Verse 2: Lil Fame]
I step inside of the booth mega hard
I'm like Cool J [?]
Premier's beats is mushrooms, dog
My mic check, one, two, get me higher than dust do
Just a hip-hop junky, since back in the day
Nigga [?], hip-hop in my veins
Hanging out with the older dudes getting drunk off Bacardi
Shit, I fuck around and steal a speaker out the party
Follow the leader that's criminal minded
Hard to earn, strictly business on the road to the riches
America's most wanted, nigga, too chubby to breakdance
Posted up in the G-boy stance
This is that old Brownsville [?]
[?] no plastic
I'm classic for you bastards that want the raw dog
Put your money through the hole, my nigga, cock and go

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Blaq Poet]
I got a rap addiction, you wouldn't believe
I need that shit, that's why I fuck with Preem
Been a fiend since Run-DMC's Adidas
Before Rakim kicked over the speakers
Y'all don't really know how bad I need it
I stay OD'ing, I'm undefeated
Back in the days, shit was serious
Treacherous Three, Flash with the Furious
Five niggas, Fearless Four was my niggas
Cold Crush and Crash Crew kept me high, nigga
I was rocking it on the school bus
Beating on the table, getting my fix at lunch
I don't really know but somebody said
This shit was dead, they need a dose for their head
Just listen to me cause I rhyme harder
I leave you like Pookie, smoked out in the Carter

[Hook]
