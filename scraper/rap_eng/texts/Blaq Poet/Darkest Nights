[Intro]
The darkest night
The thug shit, hood shit you might go through
The darkest night (we on a mission)
The thug shit, hood shit you might go through
The darkest night (we on a mission)
We on a mission

[Verse 1: Ruste Juxx]
It was the darkest day, it was the brightest night
Every thug strapped up for the trifeless heist
And with a roll of the dice, all the drama begin
Gun smokin’, lead showers turn mice to men
I put the pen to the pad, so you can see the visual
Horror through the eyes of each individual
Pain in the heart under blocks of ice
So thick, no shit it could block a knife
We on a mission, knowin’ that we won’t make it back
Alive – but still we be on the same track
Survive – deep stab wounds and bullet grazes
Eye for an eye, goin’ out in the blazes
War – one after battle after battle
Automatic guns make police skedaddle
Iron man, totin’ the big iron man
Triggers get schwolled? Hot hollow tips flyin’ man
Through your front out your back
Through your back out your front when I attack
You talk shit, but you a big bluff nigga
I talk shit cuz I’m a big tough nigga

[Verse 2: Blaq Poet]
It was the darkest day, the brightest night
Two dead boys got up to fight
Back to back they faced each other
Pulled out they swords and shot one and other
It’s the same game, different name
Shit won’t change drivin’ me insane
Tell me what the fuck am I supposed to do
Lay low and do dirt with a chosen few
Don’t let the wrong nigga get too close to you
Fuck around he be the nigga put some holes in you
It’s the thug shit, hood shit you might go trough
The darkest night of ya life, just one of a few
It’s guaranteed to be, cause where we from
Kids play with guns, and niggas be on the run
Raised around foolish, nonsense and violence
Off the chain, brain off balance
You get juxxed with the rusty razor
Nobody can save ya, or blame ya, for ya I’ll behavior
Just buckle up good, and tie your Timbz tight
And be prepared for the darkest night

[Verse 3: Dirt Platoon]
Heyyo the kids where I live like the pigs in Cape Town, Africa
They shoot to kill, hammers weigh eight pounds
Got retractable stocks, clips filled with Hydro-Shocks
Back in the days niggas only had coffee tops
Harlem has changed, but victory stays the aim
Wanted to see the world, Lucifer see pain [????]
Respect the chain of command, keep a thing in your hand
And never hop off ya thought’s train nigga [???]

Yo
Bad man give a fuck about your  older brother
Throw the hammer to ya sister and ya grandmother
My two [?] need to eat plus they need they father
Easy loadin’, fit good in this [??]
Night blacker than the world on this bitch
Attack ya tribe, tell me don’t do it, speakin’ French
[?]through work, puttin’ it for years
You don’t [??]through your taxal tear, drinkin’ beer [??]
[??] Play no games
Get smoked like crack cocaine
Boxed up like strip lo-mein
Shit to the dirt, for that [???]
I got the soul of bear wolf in me
I wrestle with God and swim the [??] you motherfuckers
The Darkest Night, Ruste Juxx will [?] to him

[Outro]
The darkest night
The thug shit, hood shit you might go through
The darkest night (we on a mission)
The thug shit, hood shit you might go through
The darkest night (we on a mission)
We on a mission
