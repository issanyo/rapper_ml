[Verse 1: Hell Razah]
I keep it ghetto where it's grimey, grimey, you know how Bed-Stuy be
Throwing them block parties, building with God bodies
Before Dirty died, BK been lively
My project army, Red Hook been behind me
I spit jewels shiny, bright as Illuminati
The black owl see the white inside Colin Powell
Hitler and George Bush, they got you acting Nazi
I be a child of Israel, young Haile Selassie
Ghetto Government, ark of the covenant
A track with Rugged Man, I had to come fuck with it
JoJo, Remedy, Blaq Poet, running shit

[Verse 2: JoJo Pellegrino]
Mmm, that's how you comes with it? I fucks with it, yo
Pelle' keep it a thousand, a hundred percent
He got clout and a ton of respect
Never sold my soul, I leased to him when he cut me the check
Sit pretty, spitting ugly, I say this nice and clear
I'm the best that never did it, all them other guys is ehh
Unimpressed with the state of rap, I'mma help them embrace the fact
Move forward, take it back, shedding light, watch 'em fade to black
Blap, and fuck rappers that can't compare to me
They scared of me, Pelle' the streets, keep your ear to me

[Verse 3: Remedy]
I pop a pill, chill, sit back, release my anxiety
Got two exotic Colombian bitches on both sides of me
Make clothes, raid codes, Mr. Secret Society
I hate liars, this is the truth, there's no denying me
Fuck you, pay me what you owe me, let 'em know
Staten Island like Joey, I'm Israeli like Razah is
Young Haile Selassie, white Jew, never Nazi
There's black and white poets in hand, yo Rugged Man

[Verse 4: R.A. The Rugged Man]
Like Bo King cousin, bass in your face, displaying hate in the place
White folks hate me, I'm disgracing the race
Underground I hold the crown and I ain't gon' pass it
Every verse that I spit, I give birth to a classic
Am I ignorant? Hmm, maybe, hmm, probably, am I genius?
That's a possibility, possibly, as amazing
As I spit it's obvious, I'm the cockiest, I write hits
I don't need no Gwen Stefani's or Fergie white chicks
Kill the species of weak MC's, faggot rappers
I'm allergic to your sweetness like diabetes
Master of mack, and max relax and jab in slabber
You battle, you bagging your bitch, waving and bruising
Will leave in a broken ragged Caddy, babbling
Traveling, bullets splattering
Rat-a-tat shattering, I'm the Gracie family grappling, yup
And hating on me is like hating the truth
You can lie to yourself, but deep down you know I'm the truth

[Verse 5: Blaq Poet]
Why? Blaq Poet motherfucker
That's the name, and I'll, blow your troubles
Right out your brain, it's insane how I penetrate
Your dome piece, microphone fiend, fuck the police
I'm a known beast, I get it popping, I'm not stopping
Lyrical AK spray, got your body flip flopping
Yo, R.A., who the fuck want it?
I have these punks running back up in they mama stomach
I'm a real deal, straight from the gutter
Might fuck the hood, but you dumb motherfuckers
Ya'll can give it up, I don't give a fuck, just
Get out the way, I'm coming through like what, plus
The guns bust, no dust, no rust, trust
You better roll with the rush, don't oppose us
Or get crushed by the truck, all G's up
When the shit start you better not freeze up
