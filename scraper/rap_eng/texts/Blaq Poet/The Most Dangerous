[VERSE 1]
I’m wild and reckless down for whatever
What - flow like a mack truck
Crazy ass black fuck

What - you have now been warned
No more bullshit rap - shit’s on - now

You know the routine - I’m morphine from Queens dun
Guaranteed to spit a mean one - make you bleed some
Catching murders on a melody - niggas fucking up the game
I’m supposed to just let it be?
No - homie don’t play that - homie just spray that
Feds wanna know - where I keep that AK at
If you a pussy - then play your part
Cause you might get lined in chalk - after dark

[Chorus/SCRATCH]
Cause I don’t give a fuck
Most dangerous
You better find an exit kid
I’m dead serious

Just when you thought it was safe - I attack
Just to see the shook look on your face - now meet the gat

Cause I’m a definite threat to society
Blaq poet
Your worse fear - hip hop
Most dangerous

[VERSE 2]
I don’t understand how the fans let him get away
Like the jury did my nigga Dre
I’mma keep banging the hardest - regardless
Spread this shit through every project

Grunt tell the world who I am
Like them down south niggas say
“Yea I’m going ham”

Most official - tote the pistol
Never know who out to get you
Got to bless em with the missiles

The level I’m on - ya ain’t really ready
My venom is too strong - 100% deadly
I circle my prey - like a vulture
You know how I give it up
Nigga straight torture

[OUTRO]
Just when you thought it was safe
I attack

This is what want in a nigga that’s from the streets
