[VERSE 1]
They trying to rip out my heart
Rip it in two different parts
Now this is when all the bullshit start
Now this is when you see the sparks in the dark
You think you know it all - but you not that smart

I can adapt to any situation
The hood made me crazy - killer Jason
Survival off the illest
Gotta be the realest
You know what the deal it
You feel this
Whole team on deck
Looking for some wreck
Creeping around your projects

Ready for whatever
Clips taped together
Talking all that shit
Now you wished that you never

I’mma show you what a thug about
Everybody wanna know why
I’m bugging out
Keep the kids in the house
Cause the slugs it out

And this is what happens when the love runs out

[Chorus]
When the love runs out
When the love runs out
When the love runs out

This is what happens when the love runs out

[VERSE 2]
Ain’t nothing but drama - when you fucking with me
I dot every I - cross every T
Take caution when you approach
Might get earth slammed
Neck broke - arm broke
My bad - God damn
Real bad man
From the bad lands
Still crushing mother fuckers
Like tin cans

Ya niggas know I’m the hardest
Feasting on this shit
Like a lion on a carcass

I’m trying to stay positive
But a nigga gotta eat - a nigga gotta live
It’s hard trying to do the right thing
I might have to go back to slanging
White things
Have the fiends running
Like white lightning
Five in the morning
Kung fu fighting
Niggas know the time it is
Like a Breitling
Gotta move ill
Cause niggas might sing

The love runs out
