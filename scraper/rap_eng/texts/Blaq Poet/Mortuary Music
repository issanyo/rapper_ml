[Verse 1]

Have no fear, Black Po's here
Bitch-ass niggas to the back of the rear
I just don't care, it's time for me to tear
It's time for me to leave the rhyming spree to bleed your ear
I represent the streets, it's hard for ends to meet
Niggas hustle to eat, police hustle the beat
They trying to bust you in sweeps
They trying to rest you in peace my niggass
Follow me cause you can count on me
Hardcore for life, fuck all that other shit
Blaq Poet Society, the new government
Fuck them rappers fronting for them cameras
All the gimmicks and bullshit they all characters
This shit is real, nothing but true life
I get ill, some say I'm too nice
Some say I'm too crazy, some say I'm too nuts
Some say I'm too wild but I don't give two fucks

[Chorus]

Black, no time for looking back
Black, no time for looking back, it's murder
Black, no time for looking back
Black, no time for looking back, it's done

Black, no time for looking back
Black, no time for looking back, it's murder
Black, no time for looking back
Black, no time for looking back, it's done

[Verse 2]

I'm back spazzing, sitting back laughing
This is the year of the black dragon, I flow with a mad passion
You came to war with a water gun
Niggas know I slaughter them, this is just the beginning, there's more to come
Let's be serious, I go so furious
I rip y'all niggas from head to toe delirious
This ain't no regular raps and rhyme
This is that terror to snatch your shine
The secret is out it's mine
I'm ready for any kind of metaphor
Any kind of petty war Cinco de Mayo bring em all
And I ain't looking for nobody's approval
I'm a Whoo-head for life though my words slice through you
Haters can't handle the pain, supreme I'mma reign
Damn it's a shame and I damage you lames

[Chorus]

Black, no time for looking back
Black, no time for looking back, it's murder
Black, no time for looking back
Black, no time for looking back, it's done

Black, no time for looking back
Black, no time for looking back, it's murder
Black, no time for looking back
Black, no time for looking back, it's done
