"Roll up in the club
All eyes on me..." --] 2Pac
"All eyes on me..."
"All eyes on me..."
"All eyes on me..."
"All eyes on me..."

[Chorus 2X: Hot Dollar]
I told you I had the streets on lock, on lock
Two steppin' with my hand on my Glock, hey ("All eyes on me...")
I told you I had the streets on lock, on lock
Two steppin' with my hand on my Glock, hey ("All eyes on me...")

[Hot Dollar]
OH, KAY, kid is back
Tell the DJ to rewind the track {*track rewinds*}
All you storytelling emcees need to Fade To Black
I quit freestylin', I get paid to rap ("All eyes on me...")
I'm up in the club, nigga, yeah I got the burner on me
Run up on me and it's gonna be a murder, homie
Up in Quervo 1800
Ma got a big ol' ass and no stomach
I showed her how to shoulder lean, did she do the motorbike
I asked her, "Was it going down?"
Then she said, "Sure, ya right"
Valle
Can I get in my car?
Soon as I close my tab at the bar

[Chorus]

[Hot Dollar]
I'm picture perfect
I paint a perfect picture
Sippin' liquor
Breaking down swishas
The old school Chevelle give these niggas hell
Candy paint drippin', yeah, cause a little mail
Shades thrown in the club even though it's night time
Four dimes I'm shootin', punch a nig'
When it's fight time {*gunshot*}
Tech, my demeanor
Two steppin' with my nina
Only fuck with models
And R&B singers
Yeah
I'm international
Check my passport
But still in the hood
Ducking the tax force
No button-ups
Just white tees
Red monkey jeans
Cover my Nikes

[Chorus]

[Hot Dollar]
Yep
It's the kid with the best flow
Yep, I give it to you kids like I'm Cleflo
Yeah
Call me Hot Dollar, who hotter
You not-ah the new Lambor' covered in blue prada
Yeah, you better get it boy
Put
Shots in your '59 Fiddy, boy
Nah
I ain't no pretty boy
But the rims on the truck sittin' pretty, boy
Hey
I got a new chick
Hey
She sent me off in the new six
She said she usually don't do this
But
She in love with my music
Hey
