(Verse 1)
I'm havin' sweet vibration, see, I'm shakin'
Vivid fantasies, us and all nathin'
I'm back like Jason
The thrill is G
You wack rappers is killin' me
You feelin' me?
My murder face gon' quickly turn into a murder case
Send shots to your vertebrae
Increase the murder rate
I jack you if I have to
No wonder I'm in love with the streets
That I'm attached to
Body covered with tatoos, Scarface and Ciara
Call me Scarface, the Don of the new era
Gave gangstas my heart
Hustlers, my spirit
No wonder all these bitch niggas fear it
I love women, but I hate bitches
Shoutout to all my niggas wrongly accused
In the state prison (Put my)
Poker face to the chess game, checkmate
Thought you heard the best rapper, yet
Well, just wait

Repeat Chorus

(Verse 2)
My descent is so intent
My
Fendy lenses is ten percent
Can't see through
But I could see you
Nobody God
And no kung-fu
The guns is silent
But so violent
Only God protect the man you admirin'
The haters can't wait to say, "I told you so
Hot Dollar can't flow, I knew he wouldn't go blow"
They said
"Reppin' the Southwest couldn't be done"
I ask a million young niggas tellin' me where they from
From the
West side to the dirty dirty
I keep it real til the day that they bury me
Found wits to the streets
Top floor suites
(???) a nigga from the hood
On the house, on the beach
I can still hear my grandma hummin' tunes in the living room
You be, loved and remembered for many moons

Repeat Chorus

(Verse 3)
I bought a Cadillac Escalade, put 28"s on it
Now every motherfucking nigga in the hood want it
I guess this the life
Sell ki's
All day, shoot dice all night
Yeah, right
Hit the club, couldn't tell you all the blunts that I blew
Yeah, right
Tell you all the hoes that I knew
Yeah, right
Tell you how the ice look blue
Yeah, right
If that's your girl, then I ran through your boo
They say I made it
I say, "I survive"
I'm still the same nigga, just rollin' the ladies ride
Money didn't change me, it changed the way you see
Same nigga you knew is now a celebrity, me

Repeat Chorus

"I
I love the colorful clothes she wears
And the way the sunlight plays upon her hair
I, hear the sound of the gentle word
On the wind that lifts her perfume through the air" --] The Beach Boys
