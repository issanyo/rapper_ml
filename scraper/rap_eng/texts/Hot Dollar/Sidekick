Chorus: Hot Dollar
You can be my sidekick
The only one that I ride with
Smoke a blunt and get high with
Jump inside the ride with
You can be my sidekick
Text me when you get excited
Girl, you know I like it
You can be my
You can be my, you can be my
Sidekick

[Hot Dollar]
(Verse 1)
You say, you want a good guy, go-by-the-book guy
But ain't scared to compliment me when I look fly (Ah!)
Treat by the swag
Telling ya girls, "I got cash"
Look, look
He got past
The pants off the Dodge, the shoes is Gucci (Ha ha ha...)
Smoke kush blunts like my name Big Snoopy (What)
I used to push rocks out of Eight Deuce Hoopty (What)
Now I get grand off the stage by groupies (What)
L.A. to Mississippi
The streets is with me
Half of the rap industry resent me (Ah!)
I'm a sidekick, leanin' on the grill in my Bentley (Whoo!)
Reading this freaky text, that this chick just hit me

Repeat Chorus

(Verse 2)
What is it?
You don't remember (Whoo!)
I keep it hot, in the hard December
Maybe is it
That I'm different
Than all the dudes that you even been with
I
Bet you go
And test the water
Didn't hold you back, why would I bother (Yeah)
I'm a Leo, sometimes, I'm stubborn
Didn't mean to flirt with ya sexy cousin (What)
When we was buzzin', then we was clubbin' (What, what)
She kiss me on my neck
Said I make a good husband (Ah!)

Maybe that's what make her want me so bad (Whoo!)

Get, ya somethin' off, 'fore I smoke you 'guanas (Yeah!)

Reminiscin' on the days I used to sell coke
