[Spoken Intro]
In the back of my mind an animalistic ritual
Me swinging from a brass pole
Primal vibe is the way to describe
Dancing in my cage
I'm riding high
And there is no one better step for stroke
For the girl in the cage there's still hope
And as you peep
The scheme of things
You'll find you're living in my dreams
Yeah, I'm the go go dancer

[Chorus]
Go go dancer
I'm the life of the party
Go go dancer
Nothing can stop my body
Go go dancer
Dancing's all I want to do

[Verse 1]
Caged in a rage
The beat hits
I step into my 4x6 cell now
Ahh, sho'nuff in the house as I elevate
But in my mouth's a bad taste
This situation
I'm sometimes placed
Is it art?
Or just a display of
Flesh contained
Slanging and banging to a bass drum
Silhouetted by lights
Caught up in the hype
I'm doing my own thing
Night after night

[Chorus]
Go go dancer
I'm the life of the party
Go go dancer
Nothing can stop my body
Go go dancer
Dancing's all I want to do
(Go go, go go dancer)

[Verse 3]
Crawling back and forth
No recourse
This is it for me and my life, yeah
And it's my choice
Somebody's tripping
I feel myself slipping away
Lights flashing
Music playing as I grind in my cage
Every day and night
No matter what I do
Whether wrong or right
The music makes me
Ooh
In the taxi cab
If the radio's on
Off goes the top
And I'm going, going, going
Gone
(Ahh)

[Chorus]
Go go dancer
(Ahh)
Dancer
I'm the life of the party
(Go go, go go dancer)
Go go dancer
Nothing can stop my body

[Bridge]
Excuse me, dandelion?
Do you want to dance?
You know you oughta try it
You might find some new romance
You know you gotta get wild
To tolerate this world today
You gotta do it with style
I got a game
Want to play?

[Chorus Variation]
Go go dancer
Go go dancer
Go go dancer
Go go dancer
(Ahh)

[Verse 4]
Life of the party
Night after night
I work my butt off
While the women roll their eyes
And the fellas gawk
Yeah
But it's something that I'm used to
An occupational hazard
You see
I do what I gotta do to make ends meet
Yo
I dance and sweat in a cage to a go go beat
Though at times it feels demeaning
This feeling that I'm feeling
It's a love and hate thing
Catch my meaning?
(Ahh)

[Chorus]
Go go dancer
I'm the life of the party
(Go, go, go go dancer)
Go go dancer
Nothing can stop my body
(Go)
Go go dancer
Dancing's all I want to do
(Go, go, go go dancer)
(Ahh)
(Go go go go dancer)
(Go)
Go go dancer
(Go, go go go dancer)
Go go dancer
(Ahh)
Go go dancer
Go go dancer
(Let's go!)

[Outro]
Go go dance
Go go dance
Go go dance
Go go dance
Go go dance
Go go dance
Go go dance
Go go dance
Go go dance

(Let's go!)
(Let's go!)
(Let's go!)
(Let's go!)
(Let's go!)
(Let's go!)
(Let's go!)
(Let's go!)
(Let's go!)
(Let's go!)

Go go dancer
Go go dance
(Ahh)
