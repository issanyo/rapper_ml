Sister, do honeys be wilding? (Do they)
Tell me, Twin, do honeys be wilding? (Oooh they)
Sneak they freaky butt around your fella when they think you’re not looking
But I can damn sure smell them
Ho, don’t you know that the Mo don’t go for that?
Take your cotton picking ass, grow some natural nappy naps in your hair
You don’t take time to comb it
Your ass is always around my man praying he will bone it
Find yourself something constructive to do: read a book, be a seamstress, go watch Dr. Who
Stop dreaming scheming steaming like your butt is in heat
All hours in the street to get a piece of my man’s meat
So many other pups have the same idea as you
I suggest to them also that they check out the view, and
Take a step towards your own, in other words, go home
You ain’t nothing but a bunch of little pups licking bone

I guess you thought it kind of clever
When you decided to pick
My man as a prospective brand new bone for you to lick
But I’m sure you reconsidered, cause the case ain’t closed
Otherwise you’ll find your body lying somewhere decomposed
I suppose I should sympathize the syndrome that you live in
Nah, I don’t think so: a warning’s what I’m giving
Step aside, abide by the rules or life won’t be so pleasant
Get yourself another bone to lick, you little peasant pest
Put me to the test, and I’mma pass with flying colors
Of all the ugly moves, you best believe yours is the dullest
Ladies First is the move but you damn sure ain’t included
You don’t show respect for your body: you pollute it
Men are dogs, so come on honey, don’t tease them
They don’t need you licking on their bones for you to please them
Take a step towards your own, in other words go home
You ain’t nothing but another little pup licking bone

You know you really tick me off
The way you carry yourself: disgusting
Your clothes are always bummy and your body odor musting
You’re not an ugly person, everybody has their features
The lack of care you show yourself portrays you as a creature
From where the hell if I know, and that’s the extent of it
Ask me, myself, and I, I think you’re kind of bent a bit
Especially when you like to mess with what is not yours
Watch yourself or else your ass will be shining many floors
You know I wish you’d wake up, you’re a woman and a sister
The lack of care you show yourself proves to me you must have missed the point
Which is: preserve yourself with respect
I guess you took a pass, because I ain’t seen none yet
Bet your bottom dollar you’re prowling at the moment
Around somebody’s man which makes the someone the opponent
Take a step towards your own, yo, go home
You ain’t nothing but another little pup licking bone

Get it together and get things straight, the statement has been stated
All I’mma say is get out my way, and don’t get me frustrated
With your bone licking, nerve picking, attitude and conduct
Just one word describes your whole life: it sucks!
Plus this is a new day, you have to think before you lay
Forget gonorrhea, it’s straight up AIDS! Hey!
You want to catch it, keep doing what you’re doing
Keep on licking bone and you’re prone to get ruined
