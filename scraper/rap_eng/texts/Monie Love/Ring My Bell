Ring my bell yeah
Ring my bell, ring my bell
Ring my bell, ring my bell
Ring my bell, ring my bell
Ring my bell, ring my bell

(Monie Love)
You can ring my bell
I believe in [?] is what we swell
If you put my vibe in to this place
I will cause commotion in this face
Upside and down and down
All around and round
This is the sound, the sound
I break down and down
So keep up here with this tempo
Hold the beat, no don't you dare let go

[Adeva and (Monie Love)]
You can ring my bell now baby
For the beats that drives me crazy
Be prepared to party all night
Because I know, I know, I know
(We can make it right)
Get your body, dance together
We can taint it any weather
That's the bell I see for heaven
Because I know, I know, I know
(We can make it right)

(Monie Love)
Drop
Right in the middle of this here beat
No, it's not the riddle and hits the street
Where the sound comes from
You can't comprehend then you're a dum dum
Just groove attacks and yes I like that
It kicks your butt and never stops that
It got bass, if you can stand it
Why don't you move dammit!

[Adeva]
Letting you know, that you can ring my bell
So let's just get up and dance
And yes I do this well
No, no, I never have that
And this I can't deny
I have plenty of soul
And that's the reason, reason why...

(Monie Love)
I'm asking you
Can you get with this game plan?
And so baby, I demand you take the stand
Let me know now for what, where, when and how
The decision is yours
Step to my door
Now's the time to pick up this pace
Because the beat slaps you in the face
Strong is the motion of which I am using
'Cause this here music is fusing

[Adeva]
So let's just get up and dance
And yes I do this well
No, no, I never have that
And this I can't deny
I have plenty of soul
And that's the reason, reason why...

[Adeva and (Monie Love)]
You can ring my bell now baby
(We can make it right)
You can ring my bell now baby
You can ring my bell now baby
Because I know, I know, I know...
(We can make it right)

[Adeva and (Monie Love)]
You can ring my bell now baby
(We can make it right)
You can ring my bell now baby
You can ring my bell now baby
