Brother what is with you, you can't take a hint?
I need to shove a splint between your eyes for you to see
You and me were never meant to be
Your homeboy likes me, I like him too, get out the picture
I get your point but I'm not rolling with the punch
I scrunched up the letter you wrote me in lunch
In 5th period I pay no notice to your motion
My work is on the table, my pen's in locomotion
Every time I turn around, you're looking at my face
I try to ignore you, the bell rings, I race out the room
Zoom to another room, sit down, what do you know?
The lover's in town
The other brother (Who?) The one I want to talk to
Sitting three seats back, and I'mma walk over to him
And give him the letter I wrote
Because my feelings towards him are brewing, ya know?

Monie in the middle (Where she at?) In the middle
Yep, Monie's in the middle (Where that at?) In the middle
Monie in the middle (Where she at?) In the middle
(Go Mon, Mon, what is she?) Monie in the middle (Repeat 2x)

In 7th the knucklehead walks in and sits down beside me
I said "Yo, why you trying to ride me?"
Day in and day out I can't seem to get you off my back
What do you think I should do about that?
In fact it's embarrassing, what a buffoon
You even follow me in the ladies bathroom
Give me a break, I can't take it, the stakes are too high
Besides, there goes the other brother
I'm not Keith Sweat, so don't sweat me
The other brother's smooth approach is what gets me
He intrigues the Mon you know
So I suggest the course towards me you blow
You're wasting time pursuing Monie
Cause she's pursuing the lover only
And as my mother did she told me
Go for what you know, Mo, yo

Monie in the middle (Where she at?) In the middle
Yep, Monie's in the middle (Where that at?) In the middle
Monie in the middle (Where she at?) In the middle
(Go Mon, Mon, what is she?) Monie in the middle (Repeat 2x)

Bringing matters to a close and everybody knows
That I'm no longer in the middle
I made my decision, precisely, precision is a must
For me to solve another riddle
Step into a brand new rhythm,-ism schisms
Nope, I'm not with 'em, I've given
My undivided attention, you know what I'm saying?
No type of games I'm playing when

Monie in the middle (Where she at?) In the middle
Yep, Monie's in the middle (Where that at?) In the middle
Monie in the middle (Where she at?) In the middle
(Go Mon, Mon, what is she?) Monie in the middle (Repeat 4x)
