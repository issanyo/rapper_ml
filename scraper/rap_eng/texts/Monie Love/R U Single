[Male's Spoken Intro]
Hey, man, I'm glad y'all could make it, bruh
Ladies gonna
Look at the ladies, mmm, mmm, mmm
Girl, girl, girl, whooo!
I tell you what. When I say you got to party, you got to PARTY
Uh, wait a minute, baby, wait a minute, wait a minute…

[Verse 1:]
Is you or is you ain't about yourself
And over everyone else?
You consider you the casanova?
Kiss me or kiss me not?
It makes no diff
Confidence struck?
You will get me?
I will say “If”
Give me the scoop
Loop past the loop of discussion
Buy me a drink and stop fussin'
A lot of other brothers got the money in their fingers
Oh, are you ready to order?
I'll take a ginger ale
Pale face? Do they speak with forked tongue?
Conversation's weak unless you know where you comin' from
Dip, dive, socialize
Gets kinda boring
Especially when the catch line is floorin'
Find a spot, take a seat
Don't try to flatter me
Tell me something I don't know
Already a degree of my interest
Is slow and very low
In order for me to stay tuned
You gotta show a form of other than stereotype rap
You got the gist of it, yeah, something like that
I know you wonder if you're in the right direction
Before I let you know, I got a question

[Chorus:]
Are you single?
Are you single tonight?
Would you like to mingle?
Are you single tonight?

[Verse 2:]
Do I have a man? No
But I have a baby father
I have a daughter aged 5
Does that bother you?
Oh, he passes by from time to time
Cause he believes in supporting what's his but also mine
Mother minus father and a brother
You ask if they're divorced
Skip the topic, hit another
Times up
What do I wanna do?
I wanna use the bathroom
I'll be quick if there's no traffic in the path room
Talkin' that “what about me and you tonight” and
What'd I tell you bout the stereotyping?
Relax
Don't push and scratch a possible friendship
Did I mention the fact
That I'm all about the friendship?
Oh
Well I mentioned it now
Take a sip of your beer
Cool out, mellow down
About your family, you were slick and took a pass
But I want to know something else such as…

[REPEAT Chorus]

Single, single, single, single, single
Single, single, single, single life
Single, single, single, single, single
Single, single, single, single life

[Verse 3:]
Memories of women that you had before
Spare me the violins, brother
Stringin' I deplore
Floor that thought, sport
I'm hip to that
Sucker me from sympathy?
Nope, got to scratch
First and foremost, I think you're cute and smart
Otherwise, I say A, you say B
Depart
In socializing, I am far from a beginner
Makin' people sorry for you don't make you a winner
Don't attempt to impress me by perpetrating
I like you for you
No need for demonstrating what's not you
So just do what's in your character
Take your time, be refined
I won't be mad at ya
Clearly state your intentions to know me better
Minus the cool-cat approach
And don't you get an attitude
When I speak straight and blunt
It simply shows you, my brother
That I don't front
Yes, I'd like to meet you in another circumstance
Oh this my jam, brother!
Come on and dance!
When the night is through
We'll get to know each other well, B
But you still got somethin' to tell me

[REPEAT Chorus]

(Uh huh)
(I don't think that's none of your business)
(Good god, good god!)

I want to know if you're single
I want to know if you're single
I want to know if you're single
(Girl)

I want to know if you're single
I want to know if you're single
I want to know if you're single

(Listen here. Just because I got this ring around my finger.)
(That don't mean I ain't single girl.)
(I tell ya, I got this out the Cracker Jack box.)
(It don't— it don't— it don't mean a damn thing, baby)

Are you single, baby?
