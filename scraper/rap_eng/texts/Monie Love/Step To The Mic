Step 2 the mic, step 2 the mic, step {x4}
Now U can jump 2 the mic or U can step 2 it
Rollin' on a groove I guarantee U'll break your neck 2 it
Oh, U think my color is controllin' how I deal it
Funk is in my round buns baby, I can feel it
Can I come correct? Bet! - Roll up on the set, check 1, check 2
Smooth as I slide through turnin' heads, call the feds
Cuz nobody wants 2 miss the
Honey steppin' 2 the mic, funky soul sister
Step 2 the mic, step 2 the mic, step {x4}
Sneakin' around a rhyme style as if it was a corner
Carmen Electra's on a mission, I better warn ya
Slick is in my dialect, huh, don't try 2 fight it
When push comes 2 shove if U don't like it, U can bite it
But don't play yourself into believin' that a white girl can't jump
That's a sucker move and U know it is a big front
So just act like U know jack
When I'm steppin' 2 the mic - get back, get back
Step 2 the mic, step 2 the mic, step {x4}
Keep steppin', keep steppin'
Step 2 the mic, step 2 the mic, step {x4}
Now keep steppin'
Makin' moves, makin' moves U know is what I'm doin'
Check the flow of the rhythm that I'm steppin' 2 and
Here I go and U know that I'm wreckin' it
There will be no mistakin' and no forgettin' it
Look alive, yo, I'm in this arena
U don't need an eye test, I'm not a misdemeana
So throw up a fist and make sure it pops
When I'm steppin 2 the mic, a sucker chump gets dumped
Step 2 the mic, step 2 the mic, step {x4}
Now step on, step on
Step 2 the mic, step 2 the mic, step {x4}
Now step on, step on yo
Keep, keep steppin', keep steppin' yo
Just keep, keep steppin', keep steppin' yo
Step 2 the mic and keep steppin', step on
Step 2 the mic and keep steppin', step on yo
Uh, 2 the beat yeah

Uh, 2 the beat, Carmen Electra 2 the beat, 2 the beat, 2 the beat
Keep steppin' 2 the beat, beat, beat
And yo, step, uh, keep steppin', keep steppin' yo
Yes, step, uh, keep steppin', keep steppin' yo
Step, step on this, step, step on yo
Step, step on and step, step on
Step-ups 2 down and took a round yo
Step-ups 2 down and took a round yo
Uh, and keep steppin', keep steppin', keep steppin', step on
Uh, and keep steppin', keep steppin', step on, huh!
