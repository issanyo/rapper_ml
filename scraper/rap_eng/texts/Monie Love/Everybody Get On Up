(Yeah)

[Repeat x2:]
Uh, get on up now

(Move)
Move it

[Repeat x2:]
(Get on up)

Feel the vibe
And let's move it
Never losing out the funk that we got
Think that you can hang?
Why don't you just prove it?
Come on and take a chance with me
And why not?

I see one
No, two
No three
Four on the dance floor
Gonna give you more
Of what you want for damn sure

Skip the talk and just dance
And if it's too much
Then get the lead out your...
Ask me no questions
And I'll tell no lies
Crank it up
It just amplifies

I'mma dance
I'mma dance 'til I drop
This the jam, y'all
Get on up

(Get on up)
Get on up now
(Get on up)
Get on up now
(Get on up)
Uh, get on up now
(Get on up)
Yeah, get on up now

Can I get a witness
With this funk with the quickness?
Microphone swiftness is my business
Checking out the brothers with the funky stride
You don't want to dance, honey
Drip
Step aside

As I move to the left
Can I get a little (funk)?
As I move to the right
Can I get a little (funk)?

Two times in the center
As I kick a riddle
My name is Carmen Electra
And I ain't in the middle

This kind of funky beat is what I dream
So if you want to get a feel of this cream
Hop 'til you damn near drop
This the jam, y'all
Get on up

Uh
Get on up now
Uh
Get on up now
Yeah
Get on up now
Uh, yeah
Get on up now

We're gonna dance
Dance
Dance
Dance, dance, dance

All aboard, all aboard
Cause I'm getting funky
As you know
As you know
I'm a party junky

Getting live to the rhythm
Cause I want to
Trying to spread it
Cause everybody else ought to

Clap your hand
Clap your hands like you really want to
Get the wallflower people all out of the corner
How many times I gotta stop the clock?
Cause this the jam, y'all
So get on up!

Dance, dance, dance
Dance
Dance
Dance tonight
Get on up now

(Repeat x3:]
(Get on up)
Get on up

[Repeat x8:]
(Get on up)
