Swim in that water like Phelps
Too many chains on my neck I got welts
Run up them racks, do my reps (racks)

Spin in that pot like a tornado (tornado), El Gato keep it like a gato (brrr, brrr)
Birds in the bando, we send him that Clayco
Shoot a fuck nigga with Sigs, 'cause I don't shoot accurate when I shoot Draco's (nope)
Stuffin' a brick in the inner tube, yeah I got me a plug in Maaco (shh)
I keep a quarter mil' stashed in the bed, they give my bitch a new makeover (makeover)
Keep my feet up in the mattress like Fabo, tuckin' my shirt in, I tell that bitch, "Hey hoe" (hey)
I turn my bitch to a JLo (JLo), they know, they know, they know (hey)

All of a sudden, sudden, sudden, sudden, sudden, sudden, sudden
These niggas mean muggin', muggin', muggin', muggin', muggin', muggin' (niggas mean muggin')
Trappers start gunnin', drummin', drummin'
Niggas start runnin', runnin' (niggas be runnin')

Then I take her on a trip across the country
Silencer shoot like a troop (pew)
Shoot like I play for the Duke (shoot)
Givin' my hitman a boot (shoot)
