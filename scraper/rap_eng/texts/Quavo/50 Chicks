My niggas they aim at yo shoulders
Yo niggas shooting below the waistband (Kill em!)

Put some work in Florida I am no Seminole
50 turned double I'm a smooth criminal
They in, weigh in triple beam original
No grams here my scales are not digital
We double cup leaning you drinking on pinnacle
Audi R8, the forgis are additional
2 twin tricks trappin my chicks

Call me Bill Nye its time for experiments
Yo wrist is broke you ain't got no experience

I'm drippin in 10K for my appearance
These Niggas be snitchin like Benny [?]
My lawyer keep telling me these nigga is witnesses

Splitting whoever there witchu I'm smoking on gas and I'm laughing like Richard

Young nigga I gated my residence

Meeting with Benjamin picking up Franklin
Breaking my wrist it got me rich
