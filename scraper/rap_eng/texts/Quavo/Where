[Veres 1: Takeoff]
Broad daylight searchin' for a juug
Finna hit a kick door in my hood
Hit the right house and everything good
Dope sold, money fold
Them Arabian people, they got the gold
West side that my migo, did five years down the road
He never told, he never fold
When they brought him up in court the nigga stood up on his own
If a nigga try to run up on a nigga, think a nigga slippin', ain't know I had the Smith & Wesson, hit in the dome
I'm takin my private jet to go out to the Rome
That Dolce Gabbana, the OG gas is my cologne
Jay Z and Kanye West, bitch I come to take the throne
Macaulay Culkin niggas because you was home alone
I was trappin' cappin' nigga now I'm trappin', dabbin'
You gotta be a soldier if you wanna be a captain
Thinkin' bout a plan nigga, got to make it happen
Got to get a name even if it means snatchin'
Runnin' round the lobby with a perc and clean molly
Scotty 2 hotty, these bitches feel it on their body
Don't blame it on Takeoff, you better blame it on narcotics
We livin' in Jumanji house so say rest in peace to Robin

[Hook: Takeoff]
The nigga better tell me where the cash at (where?)

[Verse 2: Offset]
Shh, there he go
Shh, run to the truck, nigga kick the door (boom-boom)
Shh, lay him on the floor nigga, so tell me where the dough
He didn't want to talk so I shot him dead in the throat
I ain't gon' say no more
Searchin' through the house I find a suitcase with the dough
It's a nigga in the closet loaded with the .44
Oh shit nigga, back up the coat then we out the door
The lick was successful, I bought me a bezel
Next time I hit a lick it's gonna be better
I started off robbin', finessin', it's different levels
In the game I watch a nigga schedule
Beatin' up the pot, you call me Pacquiao (beat it up!)
I'm readin' the bible, talkin' bout Malachi (God)
This pistol lookin' at you, it's my 3rd eye (boaw!)
Put it into a nigga, give him a toe tie (kill him!)
I heard that you the gangster, pistol got you flinchin', think it's Christmas all the gifts I'm gettin'
33 birds in the kitchen, Scottie Pippen (brrr!)
You niggas be flexin', you actin', Mel Gibson (flex!)
Got the fork in the water, you think a nigga fishin'
Where it's at, I don't like to kill 'em, I'm a Christian
Police lookin' for a nigga, call me Brian Nichols
It's not a photo shoot, I'm takin' shots, it's not a picture (ra-ra-ra!)

[Hook: Takeoff]

[Verse 3: Quavo]
Somebody better tell me, where is the dope-dope-dope (where it's at, nigga?)
Somebody better tell me, Lord bless his soul-soul-soul-soul
When I kick in your door (boom! Get down!), wavin' the chopper all around the room
(And you already know what time it is nigga), I'd like to welcome y'all to legion of doom
He ran off with the pack, I know I'ma see him soon
There he go, he sprayin' bloock wet like typhoon
Get on the floor (get on the floor)
Better come off that dope (better come off that)
Better not be cut with soap (better not be cut)
I am the head huncho, I got head hunters that come for the throat
Don't nobody know that you missin'
Don't know body know nothin' bout Migo' business
Runnin' with the money pronto, not leavin' a witness
