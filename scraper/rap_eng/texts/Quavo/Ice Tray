[Verse 2: Lil Yachty]
Uhh, ayy, diamonds look like candy corn
Sent a chain to Melbourne, no mail, it's airborne
Diamond on this chain with the flash like it's shootin' porn
Five karat ring, them lil' pointers tell me where you're goin'
Chopper sing like Anita Baker, ooh
Hand around the neck when I fuck, Undertaker
If my diamonds had a voice it would sound like Fantasia
Two million dollars on my jewelry, big appraisal
Um, nigga ball like DeRozan, huh
AP skelly fully frozen, huh
Right wrist cause commotion
Big rocks on my wrist, so white need a whole pint of lotion
Diamonds be wet like the ocean
Want a watch like this pussy, it's gon' cost you 'bout a pretty token
Big karats and they pokin'

[Chorus: Quavo & Lil Yachty]
Ice tray, young nigga flooded (ice ice ice, yeah)
If a nigga hatin', call him Joe Budden (pussy, fuckin' pussy)
Coupe outside and it's press button (skrt skrt)
Got that nigga mad 'cause your bitch fuckin' (hah), fuck it
Ice tray the gang (fuck it), ice tray the gang (woo)
Ice tray the gang (ice), ice tray the gang, fuck it
Ice tray the gang (woo), ice tray the gang (ice)
Ice tray the gang (yeah), ice tray the gang, fuck it
