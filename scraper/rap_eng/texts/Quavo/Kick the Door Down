[Intro]
All this time
All them niggas we done tried them
We done tried to warn 'em
All these other labels we done tried to warn 'em
All these fuck niggas we done tried to warn 'em

[Bridge]
They ain’t wanna let a nigga in
So we had to kick the door down
They ain’t wanna let a nigga in
They ain’t wanna let a nigga in
They ain’t wanna let a nigga in

[Hook: Quavo]
They ain’t wanna let a nigga in
So we had to kick the door down
They ain’t wanna let a nigga in
So we had to kick the door down
They ain’t wanna see a nigga win
So we had to kick the door down
They ain’t wanna see a nigga win
Better let us in or we gon' kick the door down

[Verse 1: Quavo]
Better let us in or we gon' kick this door down
Got heavy artillery, Glock 9’s, SK’s (What else? Hundred rounds!)
I’m lookin' around, I’m lining 'em up, yo artist is takin' the sound
The industry won't let us in, fuck it, kick the door down
I told 'em that day would come, now we on top
Look at them, watch how they run try to get they spot
They wanna be kin, they wanna be friends, they tryna get in
You think that day I don’t remember you? You don’t let us in

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Losie]
They ain’t wanna see a nigga in
We independent and we countin' Benjamins
The rap game got no friends
Nigga fight, nigga pretend
Nigga act like yo man
Nigga won’t even give you a hand
Nigga talk behind yo back
Won’t happen if you ain’t got a sack
This a true story real facts
Make the whole world roger that
And QC fuck ?
Hunned bands, watch them fat
We done ran up a check
In the rap game I sit back

[Verse 3: Jose Guapo]
All the hoes wasn't fuckin' with me back then
But all the bitches wanna fuck Young Guapo now
Ten promoters at my fuckin back end
Got a pint of lean whenever Guapo fly in town
Motherfuck the rap game and industry
The streets they taught me never show no sympathy
I swear I never thought I’d be on MTV
Them M&Ms the only thing that interest me
I know why they envy me

[Hook]

[Verse 4: MPA Duke]
Back then they wasn't fuckin' with me
Now they can’t get enough of me
Now the cameras out and they flashin'
Paparazzi takin' pictures
Young independent niggas ballin like the major league
I think they done caught a disease
I’m allergic to brokanese
Young nigga came from the bottom
To the top I had to grind
I was on the block fore the sunrise
So a young nigga like me had to shine
Came a long way from bustin' bands and servin' Ziploc
Solid foundation, QC the label
We hangin' above the label

[Hook]
