[Intro: Skippa da Flippa]
If you trap you should cap right?
And if you cap you should trap right?
Flippa!

[Hook: Skippa da Flippa]
Trap in the snow, trap in the rain
Trap in a blizzard, I trap in a hurricane
I got to get this money, got to get this money
I got to get this money, got to get this money

[Verse 1: Skippa da Flippa]
Trap in the snow, trap in the rain
Hurricane, wrist hurricane
I’m Skippa da Flippa, I'm flipping them bricks
My waves are so sea sick
Back then I was hitting them licks
Now I’m so plugged in, call Skippa if you need bricks
And when I was 15, my uncle took me to the kitchen, showed me a 15
I didn’t know what that mean
Start working my wrist, so long till my nose bleed
Christmas is coming up
I’m thanking the lord no more bad Christmas eve
I’m spoiling my daughter, my mother
I threw an OG gas OG gas Christmas tree
Bands, they curing my brothers
My [?] be cool and watch over each other
Or I ship it in latex
Guess I love safe sex, your bitch bring the rubbers
Now I’m flexed up like boflex
I made that thing light when I first touch the pyrex
Active no high tech, kicked my first door and I found me a Rolex

[Hook: Skippa da Flippa]
Trap in the snow, trap in the rain
Trap in a blizzard, I trap in a hurricane
I got to get this money, got to get this money
I got to get this money, got to get this money

[Verse 2: Willie Bands]
Playing with the water like a life guard, splash
Cook it up fresh like a dopeboy, fresh
Trap out the house with no grass in the front
Still got a gallon of gas back in the back porch
Riding round getting all cuties
32 shots in the uzi
Yes I’m a dealer in Mason Margiellas
Fuck with me and flippa could whip up [?]
Yes I’m a crip don't confuse me
I’m smelling like crack, no perfuming
I’m busting that pack, no [?]
Watching the door while they [?]
You know I got bricks and they packed in the tooly
The pot is so big it look like a Jacuzzi
You play with the paper I pull up and shoot you
I’m winning while living the life of a loser

[Hook: Skippa da Flippa]
Trap in the snow, trap in the rain
Trap in a blizzard, I trap in a hurricane
I got to get this money, got to get this money
I got to get this money, got to get this money

[Verse 3: Quavo]
(Quavo, Quavo)
Trap in the rain, sleet, or snow
Trap in the banana boats
I got to go get the monefa
I’m riding around with the bricks in the beamer
Quavo the grim reaper
Do not shop with him because my price is cheaper
Diamonds steaming up on the triple beam
When you walk in the trap you get cabin fever
Look at my wrist, man my wrist a bleeder
When I play with the dope it’s like pizzeria
Golden D arches to get mamacita
I stop in Italy to get mama mias
Finger fuck the pot, I do it for real
I put the gas back in the vacuum seal
Most of you niggas don’t know how I live
Whip up the dope on the George Foreman grill

[Hook: Skippa da Flippa]
Trap in the snow, trap in the rain
Trap in a blizzard, I trap in a hurricane
I got to get this money, got to get this money
I got to get this money, got to get this money
