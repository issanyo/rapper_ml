[Intro: Quavo]
She the truth
She the truth
She the truth

[Chorus: Quavo]
I got a bad bitch and she the truth
I got a bad bitch and she the truth
I got a bad bitch and she the truth, she the truth
I got a bad bitch and she the truth
My bitch the truth, my bitch the truth
My bitch the truth, my bitch the truth
My bitch the truth, my bitch the truth
My bitch the truth, my bitch the truth

[Verse 1: Quavo]
My bitch the truth
Yeah, she already know that
She pull up in the coupe, skrrt
She drop the top and then she smash it
Ooh, she thick like Kardashian
I told her I am a barbarian
She looked at me and started laughin'
She said I'm too deep in the game, no Shawn Marion
Say to me
What, what you sayin'?
What did you say? What did you say?
Tell me the truth, baby, tell me the truth
Do you want a young nigga to stay?
Do you want a young nigga to stay?

[Chorus: Quavo]
I got a bad bitch and she the truth
I got a bad bitch and she the truth
I got a bad bitch and she the truth, she the truth
I got a bad bitch and she the truth
My bitch the truth, my bitch the truth
My bitch the truth, my bitch the truth
My bitch the truth, my bitch the truth
My bitch the truth, my bitch the truth

[Verse 2: Jeremih]
In my mind, runnin' 'round, racin'
Don't stop, no need to pace it
Waterfall like she in the Caymans
Pussy so good, almost came in
Whip it like she workin' in the kitchen
Hit it from the back, doin' the dishes
Now I'm kissin' her on the kitten
Told her not to scream, delicious
Wake up
Yeah, I did, I did
She said, "Boy don't you mess my hair up, no"
I did, I did
Yeah her body be callin'
I be on a mission, she like the position
Wakin' the neighbors, got 31 flavors
I'm doin' her favors
She doin' them tricks, she just did a split
Goddamnit she thick
Scream my name when I hit, wrote my name on her shit
I did it, I did

[Chorus: Quavo]
I got a bad bitch and she the truth
I got a bad bitch and she the truth
I got a bad bitch and she the truth, she the truth
I got a bad bitch and she the truth
My bitch the truth, my bitch the truth
My bitch the truth, my bitch the truth
My bitch the truth, my bitch the truth
My bitch the truth, my bitch the truth
