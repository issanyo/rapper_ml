[Hook: Quavo]
The sack is my religion
The sack is my religion
The sack is my religion
The sack is my religion
The sack is my religion
The sack is my religion
The sack is my religion
The sack is my religion
I go to sleep with the sack
I wake up and count up a sack
Young nigga chasing that sack
Young nigga chasing that sack
I say the sack is my religion
The sack is my religion
The sack is my religion
The sack is my religion

[Verse 1: Johnny Cinco]
The sack is my religion
Young nigga only want the hundreds and the fifties
Spending all the twenties
Trapping in the trenches
Trapping with the fishes
Mama washed the dishes, now I Cartier my lenses
Now I Cartier my lenses
Young street nigga used to hop up over fences
Bossed up on my ho, now all my bitches wear Givenchy
Bossed up on my ho, now all my hoes ride them Benzes
Please don't get offended
I ain't never lied
Better arm the shooter, arm the fucking [?]
Tryna pawn a hundred llamas, shoot the dirty five
Shoot my partner's five, shoot buck nine
Quavo all time

[Hook: Quavo]
The sack is my religion
The sack is my religion
The sack is my religion
The sack is my religion
The sack is my religion
The sack is my religion
The sack is my religion
The sack is my religion
I go to sleep with the sack
I wake up and count up a sack
Young nigga chasing that sack
Young nigga chasing that sack
I say the sack is my religion

The sack is my religion
The sack is my religion

[Verse 2: Quavo]
Bankrolls I'm flipping
Six rings, Scottie Pippen
Every night, I sleep with that sack
Keep a chopper, known to handle that
Fishscale working like a damn machine
SakReligious came with my fucking jeans
Gave that bitch 300 just to fuck the team
The way the dab spread, you thought it was a disease
I put a lil bitch in her place, I put a lil bitch in her place
I'm counting the sack right now
Lil bitty bitch I'ma need space
Don't know how to act right now
I'm moving the pack right now
Got rich off of verbs and nouns
Score a touchdown on the fourth down
At night I get up on my knees, holler at my partner Jesus
Tell him keep that sack up in my life, I really need it
I promise to your father that I love to shop at Niemans
Fuck police if they get greedy, I know they some demons

[Hook: Quavo]
The sack is my religion
The sack is my religion
The sack is my religion
The sack is my religion
The sack is my religion
The sack is my religion
The sack is my religion
The sack is my religion
I go to sleep with the sack
I wake up and count up a sack
Young nigga chasing that sack
Young nigga chasing that sack
I say the sack is my religion
The sack is my religion
The sack is my religion
The sack is my religion, gone

[Hook: Quavo]
The sack is my religion
The sack is my religion
