[Chorus: Quavo]
These niggas be saying they having
These niggas silly like the rabbits
You said that Trix for kids
Then why you trick off on that bitch?
You need to stop lying and flexing
Who the fuck you be impressing?
You need to stop lying and flexing
Who the fuck you be impressing?
These niggas be saying they having
These niggas silly like the rabbits
You said that Trix for kids
Then why you trick off on that bitch?
You need to stop lying and flexing
Who the fuck you be impressing?
You need to stop lying and flexing
Who the fuck you be impressing?

[Verse 1: Quavo]
Niggas be acting hard like they God
Until a nigga run right up on his pockets
She don't want a check, that bitch want some Molly
I heard you're paying her tuition through college
Boss nigga, I ain't never been sorry
I'm in Miami, catching live calamari
We running from twelve in the Tauru
I do not eat on the Percocets, feeling nauseous
We got the world dabbing on the news, look at Monica Kaufman
If a nigga wasn't rapping
I'd probably go play with the Dolphins
Broke niggas just be talking
Pass around hoes like Quavo Ty Lawson
The Hitech came in the glass coffin
Smoking on cookies, I'm coughing in Boston
Money sticking to me just like a velcro
I take the pot and beat it with my elbow
I take your bitch and gave her the Chanel toes
These niggas male hoes, Deuce Bigalow
What you think I'm in the river for?
Plugged in, umbilical
Hundred thousands in the fishbowl
Creeping through your backdoor on my tippy toes

[Chorus: Quavo]
These niggas be saying they having
These niggas silly like the rabbits
You said that Trix for kids
Then why you trick off on that bitch?
You need to stop lying and flexing
Who the fuck you be impressing?
You need to stop lying and flexing
Who the fuck you be impressing?
These niggas be saying they having
These niggas silly like the rabbits
You said that Trix for kids
Then why you trick off on that bitch?
You need to stop lying and flexing
Who the fuck you be impressing?
You need to stop lying and flexing
Who the fuck you be impressing?

[Verse 2: Hoodrich Pablo Juan]
Bought a brick, made an investment
Bad Boy, Will Smith with the Smith & Wesson
These niggas remind me of wrestling
I got a pipeline all the way to Texas
Pack touched down and I dap like I'm Julio
Bandana wrapped around my head, Rufio
Ten bricks, sold eight, got two to go
My country boy want five, but he's too slow
Bitches looking for me like, "Where's Pablo?"
Count it fast like I work at Wells Fargo
Real bricks, nigga, come with a barcode
Whip it up, then I serve out the bando
Chopper, it come with a monkey
I came up from serving them junkies
Real nigga, so you know I get money
Trapping everyday, even on Sundays
Italian clothes, but I got it from London
Hood nigga, man, they love me in Compton
Bought a mansion, never had company
Bought a Rollie, never had a sponsor
Fall off, nigga, I'm taking something
No job, we don't take lunches
Guerrilla, nigga, I got Bapes on me
I whip up the brick, got a gray arm

[Chorus: Quavo]
These niggas be saying they having
These niggas silly like the rabbits
You said that Trix for kids
Then why you trick off on that bitch?
You need to stop lying and flexing
Who the fuck you be impressing?
You need to stop lying and flexing
Who the fuck you be impressing?
These niggas be saying they having
These niggas silly like the rabbits
You said that Trix for kids
Then why you trick off on that bitch?
You need to stop lying and flexing
Who the fuck you be impressing?
You need to stop lying and flexing
Who the fuck you be impressing?

[Verse 3: Offset & Takeoff]
Who do you think you impressing?
I sell that dope to pedestrians
Don't talk my head off with no lesson
I'm not with all of the extras
Black and white bitch, salt and pepper
In my backyard, there's a leopard
We press them, we apply the pressure
They jump them like the game of checkers
Bust my wrist down in my bezel
We laundering money, embezzlement
Maison Margiela, stepping like a reverend
My chopper can knock down an elephant
I fuck your bitch when I wanna
It gotta be in you, not on you
Cookie jar coming straight from California
They having, but ask for a loan and they loan you
Percocet on me, pneumonia
This is that cookie, don't smell like no onion
These niggas pussy, they small as a Funyun
Monday through Sunday, get money, be honest
I had a hand full of money while gripping the Tommy
Bag it up, wrap it up like it's a mummy
Talking about me like you know me, but you don't want it
All of my niggas, they running the game and they come up

[Chorus: Quavo]
These niggas be saying they having
These niggas silly like the rabbits
You said that Trix for kids
Then why you trick off on that bitch?
You need to stop lying and flexing
Who the fuck you be impressing?
You need to stop lying and flexing
Who the fuck you be impressing?
These niggas be saying they having
These niggas silly like the rabbits
You said that Trix for kids
Then why you trick off on that bitch?
You need to stop lying and flexing
Who the fuck you be impressing?
You need to stop lying and flexing
Who the fuck you be impressing?
