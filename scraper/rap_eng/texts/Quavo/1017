[Intro]
Ey Thug
Who the fuck this nigga over here?
Boy, you ‘bout to get fired on

[Hook - Quavo]
We don't fuck around with that fuck shit

Fuck with 1017 you'll get bust bitch
Fuck with 1017 you'll get bust quick

[Verse 1 - Quavo]
We don't fuck around, we don't fuck around
Chopper with that hundred round that’s a lay ‘em down
Don’t nobody move, don't nobody make a sound
All my niggas play with Whitney, that’s that Bobby Brown

[Verse 2 - Young Thug]
I rob in my black tee, hit licks in my black tee
I'm not Gucci, 4-5 long as Shaq’s feet
I'm sippin' on that mud, I'm not a pig, I'm a squid
Oscar flows in the spot, pull ‘em open, bust your wig

[Verse 3 - Quavo]
All my niggas keep that sig like Billy the Kid
No drag queen, but we aiming at your wig
All my niggas keep that saw like that movie Saw
Double pump, pistol grip, that’s that sawed off

[Verse 4 - Young Thug]
Take 'em off for his bails, but we not soft
We get them choppers shipped in straight from Moscow
These diamonds brighter than the light, I'm a fucking moth
Teach a lil' nigga how to juug, I'm his fuckin' scout

[Verse 5 - Quavo]
WWE, yeah, you know my team is raw
If the boss say don't fuck with you then get lost
If the plug front me bricks then I get it off
Fifty choppers in that Maybach like I’m Ross

[Hook - Quavo]
We don't fuck around with that fuck shit
We don't fuck around with that fuck shit
Fuck with 1017 you'll get bust bitch
Fuck with 1017 you'll get bust quick
We don't fuck around with that fuck shit

Fuck with 1017 you'll get bust bitch
Fuck with 1017 you'll get bust quick

[Verse 6 - Takeoff]
I’m posted at BP, serving that gas like QT
Foreign bad bitch she a cutie, call the plug up for the QT
All blue Lambo tookie, Steven Spielberg, I make movies
Me and Thugger Thugger just boolin'
Strapped with choppers and Uzi's
Got an Asian plug with the sushi, smokin' diesel, call it dully
Don’t front me no set, I'm taking off with it, call me Darren McFadden
You know I wear Prada, you niggas wear nada
I can get you knocked off, that’s a done dada
Tomorrow the Louis, I'm tired of the Truey
But niggas can’t do it so I gotta do it (do it, do it)

[Hook - Quavo]
We don't fuck around with that fuck shit
