[Intro]
I got it, got it ... Huh
Yo, yo

[Hook: Quavo]
Young nigga flying pigeons all over the sea
Wrist game got my arm strong, Hercules
Got the molly in the jar look like Dippin' Dots
Gettin' money I got work call it Chris Rock
I got the dope in my sock, I got the dope, I got the dope in my sock
I got the dope in my sock, I got the dope, I got the dope in my sock
I got the dope in my sock, I got the dope, I got the dope in my sock
I got the dope in my sock, I got the dope, I got the dope in my sock

[Verse 1: Quavo]
I got the dope, hit her one time and I bet you gon' choke
Trying to take my dope my nigga
I'm coming to hang you on rope
Feeling like Slick the Ruler
Versace my shirt I love Medusa
Can't get in contact with my plug
So I'm taking a flight to Bermuda
I got the dope
Whipping and whipping the brick my arm gets sore
Drop a hundred bands off to my momma nigga
Just to make sure everything kosher
Hit a nigga ass with the Ropa Dope
Cause I see these niggas getting tired
You run out of bullets my nigga gon' get you BOW GRAHH nigga it's a homicide
Gone!

[Hook: Quavo]
Young nigga flying pigeons all over the sea
Wrist game got my arm strong, Hercules

Gettin' money I got work call it Chris Rock
I got the dope in my sock, I got the dope, I got the dope in my sock
I got the dope in my sock, I got the dope, I got the dope in my sock
I got the dope in my sock, I got the dope, I got the dope in my sock
I got the dope in my sock, I got the dope, I got the dope in my sock


[Verse 2: Takeoff]
I put the dope in my sock, I put the dope on the block, I'm fucking your ho
OJ I'm trapping at Texaco, nigga talk shit, but he buyin' my dope
Breaking these pigeons off chickens, serving the junk's chicken tenders
Finessed the plug for a bag of work and I'm glad I didn't ate 'fo dinner
I know some lions some bears some tigers hyenas and even gorillas
My jeweler he call it can cooler it'll buy me shivers
My boss credentials got these bitches callin' me king in front of their mister
You get the picture?
Don't get it twisted
I'm not a DJ but I will remix ya
