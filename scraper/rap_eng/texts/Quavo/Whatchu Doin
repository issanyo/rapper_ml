[Hook: Quavo & Trouble]
Whatchu doin’ nigga? I been busting juggs in the trap
Whatchu doin’? I just count 100 thousand on my lap
Whatchu doin’? up for 24 days, I can’t take a nap
Whatchu doin’? you’s a lame, you know you don’t deserve the sack
Loving and cuffing these hoes, whatchu doin’?
Trouble Trouble pour an 8 up, a bad influence
They tried tellin' Quavo, I’m a bad influence
Getting the money, fucking hoes outta Cuba
Look at them niggas, they plotting
What is you doin’? What is you doin’?
Look at my pockets, they rotten
What is you doin’? What is you doin’?
All my niggas keep a stick, all y’all niggas on the bench
Turn your bitch into a trick, tell me what you think of this shit?

[Verse 1: Quavo & Trouble]
Your ho, geek monster
Trap out the Hummer
I called ‘em up Trouble
He shoot out the bunker
Might pick up the phone like “What’s happenin’ Quay?”
200, might get this shit done today
You ain’t got you none’, that’s a runaway
Tell me what you think about getting this money babe
Tell me what you think of this
Quavo flying with a fish
Making your ho wash the dish
R.Kelly, drink the piss
Told her Henny baby, please no Remy
I be saying prayers for my kidneys
I be saying prayers for my dawgs
Fuck the law, all y’all 'hind the G wall
I send a pack to my niggas in prison
I throw a brick, like I’m Russell Wilson
I make ‘em sing like I’m Keri Hilson
Fuckin’ your daughter, your mama be MILFin’
I seen the niggas you run with some bitches
I see the money, I get it with bitches
Every day I’m getting paper
Every day you on my nuts, you a hater

[Verse 2: Young Thug & Skippa Da Flippa]
Jewelry colder than an attic
Shoot your addict, bring the Actavis
You got spinners, I got dabbers
Fuck me good and live lavish
Couple court cases pending
Ain’t stressin’ ‘cause I’m winning
Blow a fifty, what you spending?
I’m a legend, call me John Flippa Lennon
Chopper pierce ‘em, fuck a piercing
Drinking Act, it fuck my kidneys
Jewelry ice, a nigga bless ‘em
We not shooting for publicity
Me and slime commit a crime
My young niggas gon’ do the time
I Forgi’d and turboed the ride
I stay with a stick with two clips on the side
Fuck your jeweler, bae we have it
I got my karats out of rabbits
My main with Jordans, I be lav'ing it
I’m eatin’ good, I’m fish and crabbing it
Transformer pull on the corner
I got on a mink, no pneumonia
Pistols is so dirty like stoners
Dancing the millionaires right on my corner
I’m hanging with nothing but lawyers
You don’t got no rhymes, you a buster
I pour up with Trouble, I’m crushing
She suck on that dick like a sucker
