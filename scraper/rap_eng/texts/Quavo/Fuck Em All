[Hook: DJ Paul]
Fuck 'em all, fuck 'em all, fuck 'em all
Fuck 'em all, fuck 'em all, fuck 'em all
Fuck 'em all, fuck 'em all, fuck 'em all
Fuck 'em all, fuck 'em all, fuck 'em all
Fuck 'em all, fuck 'em all, fuck 'em all

[Verse 1: RiFF RAFF]
Cheap shots gon' get you thrown in the trash can
I only fuck with girls with a spray tan
I rock Cazal, you be rocking Ray Bands
I stay away from haters and I stay away from drama
I might ball for 8 years like Obama
I might sing more hooks than Madonna
1999 I was swimming with pira√±as
Used to do coke with killers on my doorstep
Used to play football like Tony Dorsett
I was 8th grade but I wanna get paid
16 years old talking bout candy sprayed
Fuck how you live and fuck all of your traditions
23 inches and I'm thinking Expedition
I'm talking bout a Ford and my life's getting bored
I already had it all but I still wanna ball
2016 and I'm still doing drugs
Still ready to die that's why my papa pulled the plug
Fuck this life I'm sipping syrup in my Sprite
I ain't got one but my brother got a 6 pack
Fuck around with me and your head getting cracked
Never been a gangster or in a gang
But I can AR-15 with perfect aim

[Hook: DJ Paul]
Fuck 'em all, fuck 'em all, fuck 'em all
Fuck 'em all, fuck 'em all, fuck 'em all
Fuck 'em all, fuck 'em all, fuck 'em all
Fuck 'em all, fuck 'em all, fuck 'em all
Fuck 'em all, fuck 'em all, fuck 'em all

[Verse 2: DJ Paul]
I don't fuck with these haters this fuck 'em all
Stick the K up they anal then fuck 'em all
They always braggers, I'm always up in the mall
Trigger ball, daily shopping sprees for me? That's a law
Knocking back with a pound of green? That's a law
Glass tables, razor blades cut the strong
I'm staying raw, staying raw, I'm staying raw
DJ Paul is a dog, live like an outlaw
Fuck your broad like a dog while she tickle my balls
Skeeted all in her jaws while she licked on my balls
I done kinda done it all
Dirty south nigga been breaking laws
Been rich like I been hit the ball
Ball sold over 30 million, [???]

[Hook: DJ Paul]
Fuck 'em all, fuck 'em all, fuck 'em all
Fuck 'em all, fuck 'em all, fuck 'em all
Fuck 'em all, fuck 'em all, fuck 'em all
Fuck 'em all, fuck 'em all, fuck 'em all
Fuck 'em all, fuck 'em all, fuck 'em all

[Verse 3: Quavo]
I shoulda played for the Georgia Bulldogs
Little dirty country nigga playing with the hogs
When I'm in the kitchen get a million missed calls
Big boy strapped running from the red dogs
I'm havin extras
Play with the block like Tetris
If she want some extras
I gotta fuck all on her bestie
The way I be balling, somebody give me an ESPY
Your favorite rapper, he be calling my phone begging for the recipes
Yeah, that way, I told 'em get it off of Ebay
Yeah, that way, your bitch favorite album 3 Way
I'm in game like EA
High life when the replay
Bought a bitch a brand new back now she walk around thinking it's a free day

[Hook: DJ Paul]
Fuck 'em all, fuck 'em all, fuck 'em all
Fuck 'em all, fuck 'em all, fuck 'em all
Fuck 'em all, fuck 'em all, fuck 'em all
Fuck 'em all, fuck 'em all, fuck 'em all
Fuck 'em all, fuck 'em all, fuck 'em all
