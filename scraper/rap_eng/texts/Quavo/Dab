Migo Jerz hundred round extension
Heavy artillery in the Sprinter

Travelling from state to state
So much water in the pot it caused a tidal wave

Pull up on the north you know that's my nigga the woods everything good
Hanging niggas from the top floor of the condo nigga like Suge
Pull up in the Maybach it's gutted out
Dressed in Margiela they give me a shoutout

I'm making the trappers wanna get their pots out
Go to LA I'm dabbin' on wax and I'm dabbin' on Santa Fe
Now everyday a migo holiday came from trappin' juggin' right at the Circle K
