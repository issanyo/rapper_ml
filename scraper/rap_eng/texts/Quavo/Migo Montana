[Intro: Quavo & French Montana]
We made a mill' off a trap phone
Shawty get me in a mood
Blew a hunnid on that ooh
We made a mill' off a trap phone
Getting that paper all I do
We made a mill' off a trap phone
We got London on da Track
I heard shawty got that, ooh

[Refrain: French Montana]
Yeah, ayy
That's my hoe, shawty go bend it over
That's my hoe, baby go bend it over
That's my hoe, shawty go bend it over
That's my hoe, baby go bend it over
That's my hoe, my baby don't leave
That's my hoe, hunnid racks on my jeans
That's my hoe, my ice full of P's
That's my hoe, that's my coupe, European
That's my hoe, shawty go bend it over
California life, I got what you need
That's my hoe
That's my hoe, shawty go bend it over
That's my hoe, baby, go bend it over

[Hook: Quavo]
We made a mill' off a trap phone
We made a mill' off a trap phone (smash)
And we got the key to the streets (key)
We got your hoe on a leash (your hoe)
And I told her how to get money (money)
I taught her how to get money (money)
I taught her how to get money (money)
I taught her how to get money (money)

[Verse 1: French Montana]
Montana
Hop off Yacht, got Wraith on crew
Never trip off bitch, bitch no juice
Smoking on that La-La
Blue dot, 'till I move
You can bet your last dollar on us, we won't lose (we won't)
Team full of winners
Came from the trenches
From the crates now we floor seats right by the benches
Shooters hop out, mask on, Derrick Rose
I made a mill' off a trap phone
Fucking so good she won't leave me alone

[Hook: Quavo]
We made a mill' off a trap phone (ayy)
We made a mill' off a trap phone (smash)
And we got the key to the streets (key)
We got your hoe on a leash (your hoe)
And I told her how to get money (money)
I taught her how to get money (money)
I taught her how to get money (money)
I taught her how to get money (money)

[Refrain: French Montana]
Yeah, ayy
That's my hoe, shawty go bend it over
That's my hoe, baby go bend it over
That's my hoe, shawty go bend it over
That's my hoe, baby go bend it over
That's my hoe, my baby don't leave
That's my hoe, hunnid racks on my jeans
That's my hoe, my ice full of P's
That's my hoe, that's my coupe, European
That's my hoe, shawty go bend it over
California life, I got what you need
That's my hoe
That's my hoe, shawty go bend it over
That's my hoe, baby, go bend it over

[Verse 2: Quavo]
Look at my diamonds dancing (ayy)
Look at the bitches panic (yup)
Young nigga trappin' out the mansion (trap)
I'm higher than the Grand Canyon (high)
You know I'm walking with the cannon (graah)
I got Dakota Fanning (white)
I'm balling shoulda played with Kansas (ball)
But I taught her how to get the Benjis (ayy)
Call up all my homies, they 'gon ride for me (skrrt, skrrt)
I put the work in the trunk, in the car, she ride for me (skrrt, skrrt)
All of my bitches got bitches on bitches
None of my niggas, no snitching, no snitching (nah)
Hit a lick, quarter mill' in a ceiling
I taught her how to get the money, she killed it

[Hook: Quavo]
We made a mill' off a trap phone (ayy)
We made a mill' off a trap phone (smash)
And we got the key to the streets (key)
We got your hoe on a leash (your hoe)
And I told her how to get money (money)
I taught her how to get money (money)
I taught her how to get money (money)
I taught her how to get money (money)
