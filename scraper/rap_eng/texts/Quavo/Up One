[Intro: Quavo]
MIGO!
Bankroll!
Mafia
Yuh, yuh yuh
Woo!

[Hook: Quavo]
I bought the coupe just to play with it
Lil mama want me to save the bitch
On the block like I'm Jadakiss
Said she hard to find like some Actavis
How you feel with this money on you?
How you feel with this rollie on you?
This how you feel when you came from nothing
This how you feel when you up one
Up one, up one
This how it feel when you up one
This how it feel when you up one
This how it feel when you up one
This how it feel when you up one

[Verse 1: Quavo]
I guess I'm up at the right time
Ran off on the plug at the finish line
Lemme tell you what it is baby
You want me to save your life, I gotta save mine
This is how you feel when you up one
Quarterback on the block like hut one
Everybody gotta strap, you can touch one
But the quote of the day, "would you bust one?"
Hundred thousand, yea I got it
Me and my niggas, hardbody
We don't really talk about it
We rather show 'em
Let you talk about it
Adolescent life, probation
Young nigga, I was impatient
Thanking God, he let a nigga made it
Now we fucking models, that's a celebration
First time eating caviar
Migo Gang, Bankroll Mafia
Wrist water, like tilapia
This how it feel when you popular
Young niggas in the hood admire us
Them niggas in the hood'll die for us
New niggas'll kill to be famous
But I'd rather go count up some strangers

[Hook: Quavo]

This how you feel when you came from nothing
This how you feel when you up one
Up one, up one
This how it feel when you up one (x4)

[Verse 2: Shad Da God]
Everyday you do Margiela shoes
Keep them pistols what the fellas do
We put murkin on the schedule
Turn a pussy boy invisible
My lil ho be rockin Jimmy Choo
All my ho's look bout identical
I get so high i dont know what to do
Bustin Carbon 15s out the roof
Put that lil bitch on a pink perc
I picked up deez blue hundreds out the dirt
Im up 100K just off the work
32, yo ass can get dis insurance
32, dat extendo extendo
Who da fuck is by my driver window
Bitch I come from juggin out the rental
Country boi dat had just copped the ______
Dem ghetto ho's dont want nothin but them Xans
I tell em to they face its fuck they man
We ballin hard we need some headbands
We smokin hard we on that headband
I told that bitch I wasn't gon play wit her
I fucked on her and she had bae wit her
I had some sauce but it dripped on her
Dem hundreds be blue, got them crips on her

[Verse 3: Offset]
Up one, this a lump sum
Why these niggas wanna walk around and cuff 'em
I been getting to the money since a little boy
Hustle, had to learn to use my muscle
Now you know a nigga up one
Taking molly with a perky, that's a tough one
I ain't trying to kick it with you less you fuck some
Bust some, let my niggas have a threesome
Pull up in the Lamborghini, it got two seats
Maison Margiela not matching with the Gucci
Smoking cookie, kick it like it's Bruce Lee
Fuck the judge, and the D.A. tried to book me
Sipping on the syrup, pop a perc
In the vert, watch me skrrrt
Trapping on the Nawf, in the bando
We was broke, we was hurt
Up now, up now
Suicide doors go up now
Bought me a rollie and it's bust down
Pull up in the Phantom, call it ghost town
I'ma dab on your hoe when she touch down
Don't be cuffing on these bitches we just mess around
Woke up in apartments, to the gun sounds
Dressing up in garments, I can rest now
