[Hook]
I done seen a lot of digits (one, two, three)
I done seen a lot of pigeons
Young nigga, young nigga, I’m tired of it
Young nigga, young nigga, I’m tired of it
I done seen a lot of pigeons
You know I want a lot of millions
Young nigga, young nigga, I’m tired of it
I swear to god, I’m tired of it

[Verse 1 – Quavo]
I done seen a lot of DJs kicking doors
I swear to god my mama know I got hundos
She paying bills by herself, I know she tired of it
I got niggas on the northside that will ride for her
Young Quavo the head hancho, I point fingers and they go
I got niggas that pull kiddos and point choppas at your nose
I talked to the lord and told him that the rap game can’t take my  soul
My niggas a fool with the tool, my niggas a fool with the bowl
You niggas are fools, take your bitch and she hop in my Rolls
She working the pole, she don’t want to be a freak no more
But young Quavo got hundos

[Hook]

[Verse 2 – Foolie]
She say I’m a fool, pull up with no roof
Aston Martin sitting on Forgi’s on them 20 ooh
You know I’m a goon, ask about me girl
I’m on that northside with young Quavo chilling in that bando
They making me spaz, I’m on your ass if you don’t got my cash
M&M, M&M, all about the  blue benjamins
These niggas they really pretending shit
My niggas they really be kicking shit
Up in your house, tie up your spouse
700 Migo gang, L.A. to the to the south
These niggas they switching to sides
Like they switching the bitches, all of my niggas gon get it
I pull up, that pistol extended
I’m kinda like I got some children
Pimping, I’m flipping these pigeons
Let’s go!

[Hook]
