[Intro: Young Dolph & Quavo]
Yeah yeah it's Dolph, Migos

[Hook: Quavo & Young Dolph]
Drop that sack off, drop the racks off
Bad bitch in my car, takin' her panties off
We know you real soft, that's real talk (real talk)
This is for my niggas that get them birds off (yeah yeah)
I know I got them people on my coattail (12)
If you ain't getting no money
I wish you well (go get the money)
I'm havin' too much traffic, neighbors gon' tell (aye, pull up)
I gotta put you down by my clientele

[Verse 1: Young Dolph]
Clientele jumpin' think I'm on to somethin'
I never had nothin', that's why I'm always stuntin'  (yea)
My right hand man was there when nobody wasn't
You ever seen three million in cash nigga, in all hundreds
Shut the spot down I smell the drug task coming
Throw away all the phones, uh
I got rich off strong, yeah
If you take care of your family then you're my type of nigga
I might sit down and trap and count some millions with you (woah) [?] Can't do nothing with a broke hoe
Can't trust a nigga cause where I come from they cut throat
You play ball, sell weed, or you cooking dope (which one)
If it ain't bout big money, then I ain't who you lookin' for

[Hook: Young Dolph & Quavo]
Drop that sack off, drop the racks off
Takin' her panties off
We know  you real soft, yeah that's real talk
This for my niggas get them birds off
I know I got them people on my coattail (12)
If you ain't getting money wish you well (go get the money)
I'm havin' too much traffic, neighbors gon' tell (aye, pull up)
I gotta put you down by my clientele

[Verse 2: Quavo, Takeoff, & Offset]
Colossal, Gelato
Neighbors knockin' at my door, ask what's that loud smell? (Cookie)
Draco, aimin' at my peephole (peephole)
Ain't bout no violence, they gon' tell, quick to call 12
Dribble the ball, bale, we sellin' the raw, shells
He poppin' that lame shit
The chopper shoot like it's a ball player
Give me the pot, give me the pot, and I bet I turn it to paste
Who call the shots, who talk on wires?
I bet I turn em to waste
I keep the fire, you Michael Myers
I'm in the dark, connivin'
Bombin', Osama Bin Laden
Under the ground plottin'
Smokin' on poison ivy, bricks in a porta-potty (bricks)
When I'm with Dolph we divin'
Slippery diamonds slidin'

[Hook: Quavo & Young Dolph]
Drop that sack off, drop the racks off
Bad bitch in my car, takin' her panties off
We know you real soft, that's real talk (real talk)
This is for my niggas that get them birds off (yeah yeah)
I know I got them people on my coattail (12)
If you ain't getting no money
I wish you well (go get the money)
I'm havin' too much traffic, neighbors gon' tell (aye, pull up)
