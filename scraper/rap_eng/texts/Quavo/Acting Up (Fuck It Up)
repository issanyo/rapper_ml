[Intro: YRN Lingo]
Ayy, wassup?
Oh aight

[Chorus: Quavo]
Got a cookie bag off the checklist (check it off)
Flexin' on my bitch with the next bitch (flex, flex)
Flexin' on my bitch with the check bitch (check, check)
Hundred thousand dollars on the neck bliss (woohoo)
Gave a bitch a rack just to fuck it up (fuck it up)
Fuck it up, double up, double up (double up)
Ran over the curb in the Benz truck (skrr skrr)
I'm just actin' up, actin' up, actin' up (woo)

[Verse: YRN Lingo]
She wanna play peek-a-boo, Lingo don't have time for that
Make her come back like a bungee rope do
Throwin' all this money, make a bitch do the boogaloo
When you got this much power you can do what you want to do
All these niggas fruity loops, the cars I ride in bulletproof
Why you tryna hate on me, I'm tryna do my thing too
Got a chopper in the back, it's finna do its thing too
Got your girl up in the front, she finna suck my thing too
Hundred thousand, two hundred thousand, yeah that's the range too
Can't take you niggas serious, you sweet just like Winnie the Pooh
Get back, bitch you better get back
Got to go hard on these folks, can't cut no slack

[Interlude: Quavo]
Fuck it up, double up

[Chorus: Quavo]
Got a cookie bag off the checklist (check it off)
Flexin' on my bitch with the next bitch (flex, flex)
Flexin' on my bitch with the check bitch (check, check)
Hundred thousand dollars on the neck bliss (woohoo)
Gave a bitch a rack just to fuck it up (fuck it up)
Fuck it up, double up, double up (double up)
Ran over the curb in the Benz truck (skrr skrr)
I'm just actin' up, actin' up, actin' up (woo)
