[Intro]
Went from trappin’ out the band
To trappin’ out the mansion

[Hook: Quavo]
50 models in my section
Walk in the club we press em
I thank the lord for my blessings
Then I drip on a bitch salad dressing
Look at my dab
Look At Me Now, (look at me, look at me) Look At Me Now
Look At Me Now, (look at me, look at me) Look At Me Now
Came from the crumbs and the bums
Gotta throw up where I’m from
Look at my ex she mad
Fuck it i shout at the moms
Look At Me Now, (look at me, look at me) Look At Me Now
Look At Me Now, (look at me, look at me) Look At Me Now

[Verse 1: Skippa Da Flippa]
Look at my dab, look at my shoes
Yo bitch lick my abs, take moms shopping and I pay the tab
10 pairs of shoes, 3 bags, you do the math
10 lil Bad bitches they walk in my section
And they get to starin' and they get to pressin’
All in my group, tryna' see who I’m text in’
She might follow me home to see who I’m sexin’
I am the dab king according to Fader
I set so many trends I should be president
If you not talking bout cash its irrelevant
Look At Me, Look At Me leave em no evidence
Look at me, Look At Me bitch I’m so arrogant

[Quavo: Verse 2]
Back then you didn’t want me, now I’m hot ya all on me
I used to pull up and I want it, Now I pull up and I own it
Look at yo bitch she riding with me, cause I’m riding round the city
I’m feelin' like Diddy
Back in the day with I used to Juug midget
I got that cash, straight hundreds no fifties
Now I wanna fuck on Rihanna
Make her go and trap in the Summer
Make her go cook Lasagna, meet up with the plug in Tijuana
I used to didn’t have it, pipe up is a habit
Thats why I spent me a hundred on karrots
I bought a carpet it came from Aladdin
