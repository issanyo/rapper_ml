[Verse 1: Drake]
Hold the USP [?] I'm Dolph
They say holy when they see the chain, it's not a cross
Put the owl on it, you can never take it off

[Verse 2: Quavo]
When they see the chain, yeah, they know it's Ratatouille
6am in South Africa, I make a movie
White McLaren let the wings up and show the Uzi
Drizzy got Baka [?]
