[Verse 1: Tenaya Taylor]
Baby, I'm bored, I'm bored, I'm bored inside
I want you now, come on, come on inside
It's like a timer, yeah, oh
Wake up, I'm horny, ay
Right up, come on it
Beat it up 'cause I want it, ay
Stop playing, boy, I'm golden, oh

[Pre-Chorus: Tenaya Taylor]
When the last time we fucked to a record?
When the last time we fucked to a record?
Baby, relax, would you, rushing this record
You know, baby

[Chorus: Tenaya Taylor]
Drip, drip, you know I'm drippin'
Drip, drip, slow now, seven
Drip, drip, you know I'm drippin'
Drip, drip, slow now, seven

[Verse 2: Quavo]
Quavo
When the last time that you fucked in my backseat?
When the last time that you threw the pussy at me?
She said "This the last time," well, don't waste time
She lickin' and drippin' and droppin' like the first time
Mattress, we gon' need a new mattress
She like when I choke her
She like when I go super masculine
Ride me like a cowgirl, rodeo, top floor, no condom
Mansion, Dirty Diana, diamonds dancing
And she got no panties
Bougie, no nightlife, no fashion
Just me, yourself, and the music

[Pre-Chorus: Tenaya Taylor]
When the last time we fucked to a record?
When the last time we fucked to a record?
Baby, relax, would you, rushing this record
You know, baby

[Chorus: Tenaya Taylor]
Drip, drip, you know I'm drippin'
Drip, drip, slow now, seven
Drip, drip, you know I'm drippin'
Drip, drip, slow now, seven

[Verse 3: Tenaya Taylor]
Your place, my place, [?]
Like yeah yeah yeah
It's been a long day like always, on my way, no foreplay
Like yeah yeah yeah, won't you stop playing around?
Oh, I'mma put it down, you gon' have to run it right back
When we makin' freaky sounds, when I feel the way you go down
We gon' have to go rounds
Tell me that you want that, I'll throw the pussy right now
'Cause you know I be drippin', drippin'
Baby, told you it's just different, different
[?] into heavy lifting, lifting
Request it and I'll put it down
Come put your love on it now
When the last time we fucked to a record?

[Verse 4: Offset & Takeoff]
Dripping, dripping, dripping, dripping, baby
We different, different, different, different, baby
Driving fast in my drop Mercedes
Just to make it home just to see my lady
Oh, seven have me slipping lately
'Cause you drown me with your liquid, baby
Slipping, baby, slipping, slipping, baby
Tryna grip it, baby, take a picture, baby
The highness and we on a deed, [?]
Found out that we gonna go viral
Trying to dive in it, I can't dive in it
She was no hoe, it's a tight hole
Got the body of a goddess, still talking 'bout some lie, though
I think about you every day, it's worse than the night, though
12 o'clock, it's 12 o'clock, it's time to drip drop
[?], I'm making my hip lock
I bought my girl a yacht, then after, we fuck on the dock
She always gon' come back for me, she a maniac

[Chorus: Tenaya Taylor]
Drip, drip, you know I'm drippin'
Drip, drip, slow now, seven
Drip, drip, you know I'm drippin'
Drip, drip, slow now, seven
