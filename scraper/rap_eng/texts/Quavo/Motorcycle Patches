[Chorus: Travis Scott]
Motorcycle patches on my jacket
Rip all the money out the plastic
Put it on her tongue and now she dancin'
Gave her everything, now what you asking?
Flip, make it flip, do gymnastics
Pop her a bean, unlock the talent
Eat up all the green, taste just like salad
40 on my hip like it's new fashion, blastin'

[Verse 1: Quavo]
(Huncho, yeah yeah yeah)
She gon' make that ass dribble, playin' basket (ball)
Don't call it cuffin' nigga, I ain't passin' (woo)

Four by four (woo), skrrting all the wheels (skrrt)
