[Hook: Quavo]
Swervin' down the street, looking for your hoe
She looking for a real nigga too
I bet you looking for a real nigga too
I bet you looking for a real nigga too
Swervin' down the street, looking for your hoe
She looking for a real nigga too
I bet you looking for a real nigga too
I bet you looking for a real nigga too

[Verse 1: Quavo]
I heard she looking for a real nigga
And if you're broke she can't deal with ya'
She got a house on the hill, nigga
And she don't want no nigga livin' with her
The type of girl to mind her own business
At 3 O'Clock she at LA Fitness
Hell nah, she ain't got no children
That's the type of hoe I'm missin'
I don't mean to call you "hoe, " that's how I talk
But I'm asking you to clean up a dog
You can tell I'm arrogant it's in my walk
She looking for a real nigga, I'm the one to call
Zoom-zoom there go the keys to my room
Mamacita has the keys to my Bimmer
I'm a real nigga, baby, nice to meet 'ya
I'm a real nigga, I know how to treat her
I'm a real nigga, I will never leave her
I keep it real, I ain't scared to say, "I need 'ya"
And every time you come around you give me fever

[Hook: Quavo]
Swervin' down the street, looking for your hoe
She looking for a real nigga too
I bet you looking for a real nigga too
I bet you looking for a real nigga too
Swervin' down the street, looking for your hoe
She looking for a real nigga too
I bet you looking for a real nigga too
I bet you looking for a real nigga too

[Verse 2: Skippa Da Flippa]
Real niggas, real intentions
I promise to hold you down, all you got to do is listen
See, most of them suspicious, but you can be my missus
And I can be your genie and grant all your wishes
You want a nigga like me? Well tell me, is you worth it?
Old school and skirts, and I stroke you get nervous
Vec' fully loaded, mine I control it
Shopping sprees, Italy, she know I blow it
Choices and decisions, givin' a nigga auditions
Now I got a lil' tension cause a bitch blowin' up my mentions
Would you hold me down if I was in?
Would I hold you down if you was strippin'?
A hoe gon' be a hoe, and a bitch always gon' be bitchin'

[Hook: Quavo]
Swervin' down the street, looking for your hoe
She looking for a real nigga too
I bet you looking for a real nigga too
I bet you looking for a real nigga too
Swervin' down the street, looking for your hoe
She looking for a real nigga too
I bet you looking for a real nigga too
I bet you looking for a real nigga too
