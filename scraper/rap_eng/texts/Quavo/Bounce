[Intro: Chris Brown]
Yeah, yeah
Khalil

[Chorus: Quavo]
Girl, make that ass bounce, bounce (boing)
She shakin' for money, she shakin' for money
Bounce, bounce (bounce)
All of my niggas that have them blue hunnids
Bounce, bounce (boing)
Hannah Montana, Dirty Diana (Hannah)
She shakin' so hard, she shakin' so hard
Lil' mama got stamina
Bounce, bounce (boing, shake it)
Girl, make that ass bounce, bounce (shake it, ayy, ayy)
Make that ass touch the ground, a nigga wanna see you bounce (woah, woah)
Make that ass touch the ground, a nigga wanna see you bounce (woah, woah)

[Verse 1: Kid Red]
Ha, I got a bad bitch with good credit
Bitch, you on a Perc', I'm Offset
Went to Chiraq with the pack, I bought a Mac-11
Keep my business on the low 'cause these niggas tellin'
You niggas pay for the pussy, I play with that pussy for free
I'm comin' straight outta Compton, all a nigga know is money and lean
Poppin' them pills, when I fuck on your bitch, tell her look in the mirror
Take off that lingerie, leave on 'em heels, she lovin' my tattoos, I'm pullin' her hair
I know that she freakin', pussy poppin' for a pair of sneakers
Lil' mama be geekin', the pussy so good, lil' mama be leakin'
Doors suicide, limo tints and that candy paint
And them hoes like the one time, 100 thousand dollars make 'em bounce

[Chorus: Quavo & Chris Brown]
Girl, make that ass bounce, bounce (boing)
She shakin' for money, she shakin' for money (woah, oh)
Bounce, bounce (bounce)
All of my niggas that have them blue hunnids
Bounce, bounce (boing)
Hannah Montana, Dirty Diana (Hannah) (ooh, ooh)
She shakin' so hard, she shakin' so hard
Lil' mama got stamina (yeah)
Bounce, bounce (boing, shake it)
Girl, make that ass bounce, bounce (shake it, ayy, ayy) (ah, ah)
Make that ass touch the ground, a nigga wanna see you bounce (woah, woah) (woah, oh)
Make that ass touch the ground, a nigga wanna see you bounce (woah, woah)

[Verse 2: Chris Brown]
Throw that ass in a circle, drop it down and pick it up
She love trap niggas smokin' on that cookie, drinkin' mud
Bathing Ape, my AK, whole banana clips (bop, bop!)
I got the plug, why you fuckin' with that water whip? (Ow!)
Yeah, she already know I'm a stoner
Presidential smokin' California, you can smell that Obama aroma
I ain't worried 'bout nothin', got that .45 in that holster
Virginia nigga, west coast, ain't braggin' or boastin' but it's a quarter mill for these trophies
She never been on a private flight
She told me she fuckin' for a ticket to see One Hell of a Nite
Oh baby, you know these bitches the baddest, I make 'em hoes sleep on the couch
I done fucked so many bitches, a nigga done really lost count

[Chorus: Quavo & Chris Brown]
Bounce, bounce (boing, shake it) (ah, ah)
Girl, make that ass bounce, bounce (boing)
Make that ass touch the ground, a nigga wanna see you bounce (woah, woah) (woah, oh)
Make that ass touch the ground, a nigga wanna see you bounce (woah, woah)

[Verse 3: Quavo]
I like thick hoes (woah, ayy)
Young rich nigga with a bankroll (bankroll)
Pop that pussy on the pole (pop that, damn)
It's me and my niggas, baby, you know what we came for (uh)
The Percocet mixed with the Xanax (Xans)
Lil' mama, she came with no panties (nope)
The molly like Marilyn Manson
Got fifty bitches all up in my mansion (bad)
Lil' mama, she hot like a fever (hot)
I'm ballin' like Gilbert Arenas (uh)
Smokin' on kush in that reefer (gang, gang)
She call up my phone and hit like a beeper (brrr)
Bounce that ass like a pogo (boing)
She fuckin' with Quavo, head huncho (huncho)
My life is trap out that bando (woo)
Her plug came in on that camel (woo)
The way that she shakin', way that she dancin'
Damn, lil' mama got stamina (shake it)
She dancin' like Dirty Diana
She gettin' so nasty, I call that bitch Pamela

[Chorus: Quavo & Chris Brown]
Bounce, bounce (boing, shake it) (ah, ah)
Girl, make that ass bounce, bounce (boing)
Make that ass touch the ground, a nigga wanna see you bounce (woah, woah) (woah, oh)
Make that ass touch the ground, a nigga wanna see you bounce (woah, woah)

[Verse 4: Takeoff]
That booty delicious, she with it
She pussy poppin', shakin' ass and titties
I'm a young rich nigga, that's my religion
Fuckin' that chick, money makin' millions
Keep bossin' with bitches and I'm on a mission
Frank Lugers on, I'm not scratchin', they itchin'
Butt naked bitches whippin' in the kitchen
Whippin' up D until 'til they get dizzy
She shakin' it like it's a dancer
I done put a whole lot of money around her (ayy)
She poppin' it like it's a movie audition
So I had to put this on camera (flash)
She twerkin' so long, she got stamina
Saw me pull up in the tarantula (skrrt)
She tell me she don't fuck with amateurs
And she gon' let me fuck if she hit that cannabis

[Outro: Quavo]
Girl, make that ass bounce
