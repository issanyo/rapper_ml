[Intro: Bebe Rexha]
Desire, two souls on fire
Desire, two souls on fire

[Verse 1: Bebe Rexha & Quavo]
You got me out here looking foolish
Look like a dog, I'm drooling
Close your mouth, boy, and just prove it
And you know just the way to do it
You gon' make me bring the bag, girl, believe me (Oh yeah, yeah, yeah)
You gon' make me pop some tags, fashion season (Oh yeah, yeah, yeah)
You gon' make me do those moves, stop your breathing (Oh yeah, yeah, yeah)
If you losing faith, I make you believe it

[Pre-Chorus: Quavo & Bebe Rexha]
Got me feeling some type of way (Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
Got a chain on my heart, and it's spinning in diamonds

[Chorus: Bebe Rexha & Quavo]
Desire, two souls on fire
Make me feel some type of way
Desire, two souls on fire
Feel some type of way
Desire, two souls on fire
Make me feel some type of way
Desire, two souls on fire

[Verse 2: Bebe Rexha & Quavo]
We can go out to the islands on privates
We can drive the latest cars, no mileage
We can do whatever you like, just be quiet
If you don't break my heart, I'll let you inside it

[Pre-Chorus: Quavo & Bebe Rexha]
Got me feeling some type of way (Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
Got a chain on my heart and it's spinning in diamonds
And that chain around your heart got me blinded

[Chorus: Bebe Rexha & Quavo]
Desire, two souls on fire
Make me feel some type of way
Desire, two souls on fire
Feel some type of way
Desire, two souls on fire
Make me feel some type of way
Desire, two souls on fire
Do I make you feel some type of way?

[Bridge: Bebe Rexha, Both]
(Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
Got a chain around my heart and it's spinning in diamonds
(Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
And that chain around your heart got me blinded

[Chorus: Bebe Rexha & Quavo]
Desire, two souls on fire
Make me feel some type of way
Desire, two souls on fire
Feel some type of way
Desire, two souls on fire
Make me feel some type of way
Desire, two souls on fire
Do I make you feel some type of way?
