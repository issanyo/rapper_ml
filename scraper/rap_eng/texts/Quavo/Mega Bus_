[Hook: PeeWee Longway]
On the pounds, on the Megabus
I pray I make it
Ms in my nuts, since I came up slanging crack
All my Mama used to say was "son, I hope you make it back"
All my Mama used to say was "Son, I hope you make it back"
Came up on a couple grams, ain't no way I'm looking back

[Verse 1: PeeWee Longway and MPA Turk]
Took a chopper with the curves on the clip
Imma wip them birds in the wip
Break a couple duces, then I make it out the lighthouse
Took ten bands, bup them on the table, then my Mama asked "what?"
I'm back on road with the OG, I'm OT with them ho Bs
Soon as I touch down with them pounds, 44 please
I off m before you sneeze
With the G, 44 Gs
I pray I make it back, I'm just tryna go make a sack
Third row, trap, meet up with Yo Gotti
Talk about clips with them curves on them choppers
Birds take a bath, I pull up with the offer
Longway came from kicking sockets
Drop a double diss, and call it chopper talking

[Hook: PeeWee Longway]
On the pounds, on the Megabus
I pray I make it
Ms in my nuts, since I came up slanging crack
All my Mama used to say was "son, I hope you make it back"
All my Mama used to say was "Son, I hope you make it back"
Came up on a couple grams, ain't no way I'm looking back

[Verse 2: Quavo]
Quavo!
I'm praying I get all these bills
On the highway, there go 12
Young nigga, don't spark up that ail
With that smell, you might tell
My fam tredition, is rappin chickens
In the bando, kicken in it
Mob ties, born in it
Mega bus, we put a bomb in it
Get a show for the prosicuting kids, just to make them drop the charges
Got my car out the inpound, then I went and put in the Forbs list
Mama call me every morning, wanna know where I'm going
She said "be safe where I'm heading, Imma pray for you, son"
They sold out, which one
Should I keep it? which one
RIP to Big Pun
Fat Joe in the trunk
Cokeaina got her tung, Migo plug on the run
He told me, "go get a hundred

[Hook: PeeWee Longway]
On the pounds, on the Megabus
I pray I make it
Ms in my nuts, since I came up slanging crack
All my Mama used to say was "son, I hope you make it back"
All my Mama used to say was "Son, I hope you make it back"
Came up on a couple grams, ain't no way I'm looking back
