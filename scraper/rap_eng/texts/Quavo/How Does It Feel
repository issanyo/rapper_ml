[Hook]
How does it feel to put them Forgies on that bitch
How does it feel to put that Rollie round your wrist
How does it feel to put your feet in Louie kicks
How does it feel to walk around with a thick bitch
How does it feel to be real, how does it feel
How does it feel to blow a bill, how does it feel
How does it feel to have your wrist on chill
How does it feel to have them young niggas thats gon' kill

[Verse 1]
Aston Martin foreign, broke nigga be boring
100 pounds of that kush, weed every morning
Wake up every morning, hop out like we touring
Your sweat dripping, mine pouring
Pink slip [?]
My lil' niggas stay gunning, them ho niggas stay running
These niggas ain't real street niggas, they gotta show me something
In the jungle with them monkeys, tripping like King Kong
Bag seal that loud pack so they can't smell nothing

[Hook]

Your main bitch, she wit' it
Ass out and I'm tipping
Balling all on my pivot, crossover Scottie Pippen
Your main nigga he wishing, hand roll up a sticky
My big bag do you get it, red bottoms cause she picky
My ho worth half a ticket, Ferragamo no Fendi
Ray bands 750, the roof gone cause I tricked it
Rozay got me tipsy, I'm a boss, bitch I hurt feelings
When she get on that molly, she swallowing all my children

[Hook]
