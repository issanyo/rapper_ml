[Chorus: Shoffy]
Do you slide on all your nights like this?
Do you try on all your nights like this?
Put some spotlight on the side
Whatever comes, comes through clear
Do you slide on all your nights like this?
Do you try on all your nights like this?
Put some spotlight on the side
And whatever comes, comes through clear

[Verse 1: Shoffy]
All this jewelry ain't no use when it's this dark
It's my favorite part, we see the lights, they got so far
It went too fast, we couldn't reach it with our arms
Wrist on a wrist, a link of charms, yeah
Laying, we're still a link apart
It's like we could die here all young
Like we could dye hair all blonde
If we could see in twenty twin
Twice we could see it 'til the end

[Pre-Chorus: Shoffy]
Put that spotlight on her face
Put that spotlight on her face
Put that spotlight on her face
Put that spotlight on her face

[Chorus: Shoffy]
Do you slide on all your nights like this?
Do you try on all your nights like this?
Put some spotlight on the side
And whatever comes, comes through clear

[Bridge: Frank Ocean]
I might
Empty my bank account
I might
Buy that boy with a pipe

[Verse 2: Quavo]
We gon' pipe up and turn up (pipe up)
We gon' light up and burn up (burn up)
Mama too hot like a (like what?)
Mama too hot like a furnace (furnace)
I got a hundred G's in my Goyard (G's)
My diamonds gon' shine when the lights dark (shine)
You and I take a ride down the boulevard (yeah)
And your friends really wanna break us apart
Good lord

[Chorus: Shoffy]
Do you slide on all your nights like this?
Do you try on all your nights like this?
Put some spotlight on the side
And whatever comes, comes through clear
