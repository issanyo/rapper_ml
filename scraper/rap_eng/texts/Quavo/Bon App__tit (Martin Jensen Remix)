[Verse 1: Katy Perry]
Looks like you've been starving
You've got those hungry eyes
You could use some sugar
'Cause your levels ain't right
I'm a five-star Michelin
A Kobe flown in
You want what I'm cooking, boy

[Pre-Chorus: Katy Perry]
Let me take you
Under candle light
We can wine and dine
A table for two
And it's okay
If you take your time
Eat with your hands, fine
I'm on the menu

[Chorus: Katy Perry]
'Cause I'm all that you want, boy
All that you can have, boy
Got me spread like a buffet
Bon a, bon appétit, baby
Appetite for seduction
Fresh out the oven
Melt in your mouth kind of lovin'
Bon a, bon appétit, baby

[Post-Chorus: Katy Perry]
That you want
Bon appétit, baby
That you want
Bon appétit, baby

[Verse 3: Quavo]
Sweet potato pie
It'll change your mind
Got you running back for seconds
Every single night

[Verse 4: Quavo]
Sweet tooth, no tooth fairy
Whipped cream, no dairy
Got her hot light on, screaming, "I'm ready"
But no horses, no carriage

[Pre-Chorus: Katy Perry]
Under candle light
We can wine and dine
A table for two
And it's okay
If you take your time
Eat with your hands, fine
I'm on the menu
(Go ahead)

[Chorus: Katy Perry]
'Cause I'm all that you want, boy
All that you can have, boy
Got me spread like a buffet
Bon a, bon appétit, baby
Appetite for seduction
Fresh out the oven
Melt in your mouth kind of lovin'
Bon a, bon appétit, baby

[Post-Chorus: Katy Perry]
That you want
Bon appétit, baby
That you want
Bon appétit, baby
That you want
That you want
That you want
Bon appétit, baby
