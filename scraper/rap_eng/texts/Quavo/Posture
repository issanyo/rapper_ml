[Skippa Da Flippa]
QC!
Flippa!

[Hook: Skippa Da Flippa]
Rich nigga meal eating shrimp, steak, and lobster
The hoe tried to flex I told her bitch check her posture
Money team the pot beat it just like a boxer
Dab so hard I think that I need an Oscar
Takeoff pull up so I stay activated
I stay with the pints nigga fuck getting faded
These niggas will do anything to get famous
Givenchi my body, Steve Madden my lady (Flippa!)
Please check your posture
Hoe check your posture
Burberry my jeans, I don't do the dockers
How David Beckham kick it, I don't play soccer
Please check your posture
Bitch check your posture
So many babies, I might need a walker
It's only real niggas I got on my roster

[Verse 1: Skippa Da Flippa]
Flippa!
John Travolta chopper re-range ya posture
No Ferragamo you gone need a doctor
My wrist is a monster, my dab is so crazy
And not to mention that my posture's proper
Two twin choppers when I shoot, it's hot lava
Tatted like a white boy, no Travis Barker
Bitch with a fat ass, I'ma' call her ms. Parker
Write a script to a movie you know that Flippas' the author
Triple cup and backwood while I'm performing
Perfect preparation prevents the performance
Sniff the whole 8-ball if you got endurance
So cover ya' hoe just like you her insurance
Perfect posture take a trip to Bermuda
Lay em' down in 60 seconds, I'm the shooter
Fish fillet Uzi gone turn ya' to tuna
My real nigga stand up but I am no Luda
Posture dab when I sell a slab
So much drank, like I own the lab
Posture penny perfect, you can't do the math
I capped off every bag when I was selling swag
Givenchi skinnies when I shoot the semi
Her postures' a little off when she hit the hemi
Ain't nothing rented and the Wraith is tented
Posture perfect when I handle business

[Verse 2: Hoodrich Pablo Juan]
Hoodrich...Pablo Juan
Whippin' babies having bottles like toddlas'
Me and Skippa eating lobster pasta
Me and Guapo pull up on the cookie monster
Shoot at these niggas, my aim good posture
Can't go nowhere without baby choppa'
Trappin' been seen me, the streets on lock
Es√© just sent me like twenty blocks
I'ma' hit the pot, I'm John Hancock
Whip with a posture correct
Sending dope through the correctional officer
Probably on the percocet
Pouring up Hi-Tech, straight from glass bottles
I like how she stand in them red bottoms
Go to New York just to go to Barney's
Fifty pointers on the rollie it's on me
Check my posture like I came from the corna'
Still havin' brick but don't tell nobody
Sensei black belt in karate
Give it to Skippa he flippin' on Jimmy Carter
Makin' the pancake, just add water
A Migo I play like a Charger
Shoot it from wet pump, beat down in Florida
I'm a OG like my nigga Parker
Christian Louboutin, I'm walking in slaughter

[Verse 3: Quavo]
Quavo...
Birds sang like the Opera
Fifty bricks on the helicopter
Making power plays for the dollar
Went to the mall spent a grip on a posture
I am the honcho, I do not acknowledge ya'
I'm in Givenchi, I used to wear Nautica
Walk in the hood and they tell me I'm proud of ya'
I'm whippin' up white girl, call that hoe Nadia
Bitch you betta knock at that door, what the fuck ?
We get it a hundred percent and we send it straight up
In a dice game I bet I won't buck
I started with fifty and now I'm way up
When I grab the choppa I go get the nuts
I can't love the women in benji's I trust
Iced out the rollie like a hockey puck
I just wanna fuck her and give her right up
You can have the big ring cause I want the world cup
We came out of nowhere like volcano rupt
Bag up the cookie it's smelling like must
I'm taking yo iPhone in case you snap up
You taking our posture like you sign to us
You be the one to put three in yo blunt
Hundred thousand on me, feel like a monk
Heavy metal on me never been punked
