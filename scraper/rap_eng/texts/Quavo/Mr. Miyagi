[Intro]
Yeah, woah, Migo
Let me take these fuck niggas back to the Bando man (ugh)

[Verse 1: Quavo]
Take 'em to the house with the boards on the windows
It's a drought in the summer (trap!), but we working all winter
Take 'em to the Northside, where Migo was invented (Nawf)
Run up on me now, bet I hit you with extensions (UGH)
Dabbin' through the city they gon' fuck up nothin' but Benji's
When I walk into the trap house
Bet I run straight to the kitchen (one Time)
I got Molly, I got white, I know, that I told you in Hannah Montana (Hannah Montana)
Made a million overnight
Versace it got me a drop head Phantom (Versace)
Mr. Miyagi (Mr. Miyagi)
Little bitty bitch she walkin' up look at her body
The work I divide it
Acrobatic nigga take the brick and circumcise it
You'll remember (member me)
Trappin' out the house the window boarded up with timber!
You a pretender ('tender)
I am the boss, Head Honcho call me Simba (Simba!)

[Verse 2: Takeoff]
You niggas just some beginners (Beginner)
I am a boss call me Simba (Boss)
I am the master I'm Mr.Miyagi
I'm in the kitchen whippin' chemicals
My nigga's criminals wanna get physical
You walk around with your pockets on minimal
Remix a brick and make it look identical
Overseas chopper intercontinental
Trap out the bando before you serve look out the peep-hole
The people be watching for kilos
I'm with the vato's que pasa to all my amigo's
I'm trappin' I feel like I'm Nino
And all this mother fucking cheese (broccoli)
Nigga just call me Dorito
I'm selling fishes I got Nemo fuck with Carlito
Ten key's on the yacht boat shoot freethrow

[Verse 3: Offset]
Offset
Detective looking for me asking bout me
Nigga where's the pistol nigga know you got it (where is it)
Somebody snitchin' sayin' that I'm the nigga (somebody)
In the city plugged in like a socket
I don't know what the fuck these nigga's talkin' bout?
Sat me down asked me you gonna talk or not
No arguing, fussin', discussion
I do not know nothing I haven't see nothin' (no!)
And the Mulsanne parked in the driveway
Nobody thought I would be back here in it
When I pull up I'm lookin in dey face
I thank the lord because I'm eatin' say my grace
Back in the Bando whippin' particles
And you can catch me in magazine articles
Balenciaga nigga dressing remarkable
In the game permanently not erasable
