[Intro: Quavo]
'Know whatchua'll doin?
But I'm piped up
See that boy right there?
He piped up
See that girl right there?
She piped up

[Hook: Quavo]
Pipe it up, pipe it up, pipe it up, pipe it up
Pipe it up, pipe it up, pipe it up, pipe it up
I walk in the club just to pipe it up
I stand on this stage and I pipe it up
Get a regular ho tell her pipe it up
Go buy a bando then I pipe it up
Pipe it up, pipe it up, pipe it up, pipe it up
Pipe it up, pipe it up, pipe it up, pipe it up
I walk in the club just to pipe it up
I stand on this stage and I pipe it up
Get a regular ho tell her pipe it up
Go buy a bando then I pipe it up

[Verse 1: Quavo]
Quavo!
Pipe it up, pipe it up, pipe it up (Pipe it up, pipe it up, pipe it up)
I walk in the club just to pipe it up
She was a basic bitch til I piped her up
I'm just doing my dab, I called it the pipe it up
They know that I'm having blue Benjamin's
They know I'm on top of the pyramid
They know I'ma go down in Guinness
All this dab a nigga drippin'
Piped up in the city
Piped up with yo bitches
Piped up in Givenchy
Piped up new edition
When a nigga start talking shit, gotta pipe up the ammunition
Your bitch walkin' around piped up
When she see me, she blowin' kisses
Feelin' like Aladdin, Quavo the genie
I grant your ho three wishes
You know I do magic, Quavo Houdini
I touch the pack and get it missin'

[Hook: Quavo]
Pipe it up, pipe it up, pipe it up, pipe it up
Pipe it up, pipe it up, pipe it up, pipe it up
I walk in the club just to pipe it up
I stand on this stage and I pipe it up
Get a regular ho tell her pipe it up
Go buy a bando then I pipe it up
Pipe it up, pipe it up, pipe it up, pipe it up
Pipe it up, pipe it up, pipe it up, pipe it up
I walk in the club just to pipe it up
I stand on this stage and I pipe it up
Get a regular ho tell her pipe it up
Go buy a bando then I pipe it up

[Verse 2: Takeoff]
Broke niggas still saying "turn it up!"
All my young rich niggas screaming out "pipe it up!"
Benjamins old they extinct like a dinosaur
Look at yo diamonds, yo diamonds ain't bright enough
I send the work to get used in a catapult
Play with the dope in the snow like a hockey puck
Pipe it up, pipe it up, no Roddy Piper
They biting the flow nigga but the Migos got the title
So now niggas dabbing, don't know how it happen
I been touchdown on you niggas ask Madden
Don't forget bitch I'm the dab daddy
In stores now YRN fashion (Yung Rich Nation!)
Pipe it up, bitch it's gon' be the new anthem
I come through swervin in a black Panamera
Pull out the camo when you see me Christian Louboutin, hopping out that's an animal
Now remember, fore we made this song, nobody said pipe it up
Next thing we dropping, we gon' fuck em up, have everybody screaming pipe it up
Pipe it up in the club while I'm on drugs
A nigga fucking up the furniture
Shoot a money ball like Steve Kerr
Pipe it up, I get them pints on reserve (Actavis)

[Hook: Quavo]
Pipe it up, pipe it up, pipe it up, pipe it up
Pipe it up, pipe it up, pipe it up, pipe it up
I walk in the club just to pipe it up
I stand on this stage and I pipe it up
Get a regular ho tell her pipe it up
Go buy a bando then I pipe it up
Pipe it up, pipe it up, pipe it up, pipe it up
Pipe it up, pipe it up, pipe it up, pipe it up
I walk in the club just to pipe it up
I stand on this stage and I pipe it up
Get a regular ho tell her pipe it up
Go buy a bando then I pipe it up
