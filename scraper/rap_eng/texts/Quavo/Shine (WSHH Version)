[Intro]
Migo!
Cinco!
QC!

[Chorus]
Migo and Cinco need 'bout 50 PT
The way she eat that molly she think it linguine
All these cameras on we in the spotlight
Most of these niggas they'll do anything for the spotlight
Most of these niggas they'll do anything for the spotlight
These niggas would take yo' life for the spotlight
Gotta keep me a pocket rocket with the red light
My momma told me they will turn on you for the spotlight

[Verse]
My momma told me they will turn on me
If I didn't listen it was all on me
Some of the niggas I didn't, some of the niggas I did
If you niggas didn't wanna see you win they ain't yo' friend
Not at all
Growing up had to fight these niggas like Steven Seagal
You play with me now and I'mma shoot yo' head off
Cinco gotta make the call
Just for the spotlight I know niggas would knock you off
Quit lookin' at my life, get yo' mind right
Versace my eyesight, I'm living the limelight
Not you
Is a nigga mad 'cause the spotlight not on you?
I'm killin' the game 'cause momma she told me to

[Hook]
Migo and Cinco need 'bout 50 PT
The way she eat that molly she think it linguine
All these cameras on we in the spotlight
Most of these niggas they'll do anything for the spotlight
Most of these niggas they'll do anything for the spotlight
These niggas would take yo' life for the spotlight
Gotta keep me a pocket rocket with the red light
My momma told me they will turn on you for the spotlight
