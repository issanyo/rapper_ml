[Intro : Quavo]
Flexin' on these hoes, designer all my clothes
Walk around with them O's, flexin' on these hoes

[Hook : Quavo]
Flexin' on these hoes, money all in my note
Designer all my clothes, walk around with them O's

Designer all my clothes, walk around with them O's
Flexin' on these hoes, money all in my note
Designer all my clothes, walk around with them O's

[Verse 1 : Quavo]
Flexin' on these hoes, diamonds on my neck
Pull off in that Lambo, that paint drippin' it wet
Pull off with your hoes, I feel like Keith Sweat
I'm walkin' 'round with these O, meet my plug on the jet
I just call my goons and they walk around with that Tec
I call up my jeweler, drop these bands on my wrist
I pull off with that loud, let see if it could draw
You walk around with that sack then my niggas they gon' rob
I put Louis on my shoes, designer on my belt
I can't help myself, got bands all on that shelf
Need to go to rehab, money it too long
I call my plug, he in Hong-Kong

[Hook]
Flexin' on these hoes, money all in my note
Designer all my clothes, walk around with them O's

[Verse 2 : Offset]
All these damn cameras, model they gon' pose
Pull up in a Rolls, I take your ho
I heard you cuffin' hoes, boy that's a lil old
I ain't stand no bitch, walk around with them zips
Ain't mean to flex the club, when I gave his ass a remix
You say that's your girl but she smashed the whole damn clique
We pulled up in them Bentley thang and they can't stand this shit
VVS in on gliss, I take your bitch
My bitch from Qu√©bec, her dad he my connect
I ride up in Gucci these hoes can't refuse me
Made movies, no actor, no director, just goonies
You, beyond the peanut but you so "punny"

[Hook]
Flexin' on these hoes, money all in my note
Designer all my clothes, walk around with them O's
Flexin' on these hoes, money all in my note

Designer all my clothes, walk around with them O's


[Verse 3 : Takeoff]
I got a bag full of them O, I ain't talking 'bout Cheerio
E-Every where a young nigga go
You gon' see a hundred goons screamin' out "Migo"
Got a Panamera coupe 2 door
And a true Benz scale full of dough
Hit a drought, cash out on a boat
Roll out the old school and free Bo
It should be illegal when flexin' these hoes
Twenty yayo, from Puerto Rico
Dominicano got the dope on a "No"
Whippin' the pot til her arm get swolled
Drugs he roll, diamonds are froze
Illuminati takin' bitches, oh
Bustin' the block with the rest of these O's
Gotta get money, the jet high it go

[Hook]
Flexin' on these hoes, money all in my note
Designer all my clothes, walk around with them O's
Flexin' on these hoes, money all in my note
Designer all my clothes, walk around with them O's
Flexin' on these hoes, money all in my note
Designer all my clothes, walk around with them O's
Flexin' on these hoes, money all in my note
Designer all my clothes, walk around with them O's
