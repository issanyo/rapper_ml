[Intro: Young Thug]
Tugga Tugga! Migos!
Bring them bales, bring that cookie, cocaola
Woah, I thought I told you, told you

[Hook: Young Thug]
She so not playin', she gon' stop it
I'm so fly like helicopters (ay)
Tune the car up like a doctor (ay)
Motherfuck all the crime stoppers
Eat her inside like a lobster (Ay)
Chrome Heart glasses, Harry Potter (aye)
Actavis in baby bottle (hey)
Balmain's on me like a model (aye)
I don't wanna have a problem (aye)
I won't ever ever bother (hey)
I won't watch it, ain't a stalker (Yeah)
Lookin' down at these imposters
Hurricane whip with my father
Hurricane whip with my daughter (ay)
I'm livin' life like a mobster
I serve that kush like a Rasta (Ay)

[Verse 1: Quavo]
Quavo!
He lookin' like he a robber (he lookin')
I call my niggas to pop up (go get 'em)
Watch out for snakes and koalas (watch 'em)
Cause a nigga might sing like the opera (singin')
I got your hoe on my roster (your hoe)
No styrofoam, we drink out the bottle (drank)
My niggas came from the bottom (my niggas)
Your niggas not eating, they starvin' (aye!)
Play with the keys like Marvin (woo!)
Migos the maniac, Thugger the arson (slatt!)
I beg your pardon (bitch!)
If you want the gas then we got a garden (gas!)
I'm with my woe like New Orleans (woe!)
Trailblaze the money like Portland (money!)
I make my hoes do orgies (woo!)
Camera's in my room, you know it's recording (movie!)
2,000 just for the sneakers (2,000)
My mom used to trap out the beeper (brrr!)
You might think your hoe a keeper (your hoe)
'Til you see the way we treat her (smash!)
When I put the dope in my hands (dope!)
You never gon' see it again (magic!)
I see that you fake through my lenses (fake!)
I feel like breakin' Offset out the pen'

[Verse 2: Offset]
Offset!
They broke me out of the pen'
Back at it again, dressed in Louboutin
I hopped in the Benz, I put on my lens
I put my ice on my neck, flooded, I'm drenched
Right before Christmas they let out the Grinch
I hug on my mama, I pick up my prince
They slipped, the pistols they found had no prints
I'm back to the ballin' like Jeremy Lin
The Lambo no burnin', not makin' no sense (Lambo)
Pinky ring like I'm a pimp (pinky ring)
Work your hoe out like a gym (work her out)
That chopper give you Adele temp, fade
She know Offset is a baller (baller)
We sippin' Actavis like water
I'm still a savage, run up with some caution (savage)
Put your ass up for an auction
Pipe it up, pipe it up, pipe it up, pipe it up (pipe it up!)
Dabbin' in Balenciaga
Shittin' on bitches and pissin' on niggas
It looks like I'm skiing with these Gucci goggles
And ain't nothin' changed, we still got the yoppa
Still got them birds singin' like it's an opera (brrr!)
Standin' on couches, dabbin' up in Opera
Your diamonds are cloudy, your gold look like copper

[Hook: Young Thug]
She so not playin', she gon' stop it
I'm so fly like helicopters (ay)
Tune the car up like a doctor (ay)
Motherfuck all the crime stoppers
Eat her inside like a lobster (Ay)

Actavis in baby bottle (hey)
Balmain's on me like a model (aye)
I don't wanna have a problem (aye)
I won't ever ever bother (hey)

[Verse 3: Takeoff & Skippa da Flippa]
Takeoff!
Dressed in a suit like a mobster (mob)
For the bitches, my nigga, turn to a monster (hurr)
Catchin' plays in the bando like Alge Crumpler (catchin' plays)
Fuck a nigga's bitch, they call me Brian Pumper (smash)
9th grade I did it, had cookies stuffed down in my locker
It ain't my fault, nigga, no Silk Da Shocker
I dab so hard that I need me an Oscar
'08 I dropped out, I slam dunk like Vince Carter
When you trap, gotta be smarter, diamonds water
These niggas do not go harder
Me and Skippa da Flippa, we switch-a-roo bitches
We fuckin' that bitch one time and you gon' spoil her
It's a 50 on me, walkin' with a wad (money!)
Just copped a 100 round stuffed with some hollows
I go buy 10 pints and you go buy a bottle
If I go in my safe I'll be counting 'til tomorrow
I got a Wells Fargo stashed up in my cargo
You niggas Felicia, you niggas gon' borrow (bye Felicia)
My double cup got the color of purple
And I beat the pot like I'm Hoppo (bih!)
This here's clean
And it don't take a scientist to see you drinkin' Karo (swear!)
I drop a four in a Faygo
Pull out the chopper and make 'em dance, call it tango (Flippa!)

[Hook: Young Thug]
She so not playin', she gon' stop it

[Verse 4: Young Thug]
She not gon' play, she gon' run that money up
And give it to Thugger
I'ma pull up on her wearin' three layers
I'm dressed like a muh'fuckin' robber (swag)
I feel amazing, you know I go brazy
You know I don't play 'bout no commas
I sell some more green, I smoke on some more green
I look like a muh'fuckin' forest, forest!
Come to the Kroger for groceries
More in it, more in it
So bad she got her direction from Superhead (what!)
I know it, eh, eh
Coward shit, you talk to the towers and internet
Bitch I'm so on it, it (on it)
I'm countin' it
I'm seein' right through you, lil' bitch you should've got the presi-tint (fuck it)
Yeah, she 'bout it, she 'bout it
She drop it, she 'bout it, she 'bout it (she 'bout it, she 'bout it)
Yeah I'm just a player, you not milk, you not cowin' (swear to God)
She don't need no talk cause my jewelry be showerin' (I swear)
I spent like 50 bands on that bitch, I was scoutin' it

[Hook: Young Thug]
She so not playin', she gon' stop it
I'm so fly like helicopters (ay)
Tune the car up like a doctor (ay)
Motherfuck all the crime stoppers
Eat her inside like a lobster (Ay)
