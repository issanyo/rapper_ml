[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]
Baby keep me on my P's, let's break down 100 P's
Gucci gas go thirty-three but gotta get 30 P
I don't even need a reason to hit you with the heat
These shoes don't come out this season, but still they on my feet

[Verse 2: PeeWee Longway]
Old folk keep calling us heathens
Too many drugs on the street
I'm servin' right there by Four Seasons
Niggas from the pen won't weep

[Verse 3: Quavo]
PeeWee got the bricks and the bales
Listen up to the story I tell
The bricks, they came from the mail
My plug his name is Miguel

[Verse 4: Takeoff]
I'm in the kitchen, counting up benji's
Yo bitch washing dishes and wrapping up fishes
Used to run from the cops on the block
Hit for a hot box, took it to the chop shop
If I fuck with ya, I'm making you straight drop
If I don't know ya, I'ma give ya rerock
Got a bando in Boston
The way I pitch them 8-balls, shoulda played for the Red Sox

[Verse 5: MPA Wicced]
Just took a loss, 'bout to take something off
Put it to the head, make her open up the vault
Say you got bird, head all in a loss
Soon as you turn the key boy you bout to get off

[Verse 6: Offset]
Bought a brand new A-P, but I'm always late
Everyday my birthday, now watch me bake cake

[Verse 7: MPA Wicced]
I finesse the plug for the drugs
Even though a nigga always show love
If he ain't Migos, he ain't MPA
Brick Squad, nigga you ain't my blood
Tryna hit my blunt, tryna sip my drank
What the fuck you think?
Ain't shit soft around my way
Unless you talkin' 'bout cocaine
