[Intro: NAV]
Faith in me, yeah
Have some faith in me, yeah
Some faith in me, yeah
Have some faith in me, yeah
Some faith in me, yeah

[Verse 1: NAV]
I wish that I could have the money without fame
I would trade all my diamond rings and all my chains
Just so just so me and you could be the same
Just so I wouldn't have to deal with all this pain (all this pain)
My nephew started smoking gas and I'm the one to blame (I'm the one to blame)
I'm off the percies and I'm cryin' in the rain (skrt)
Right now I'm poppin' but sometimes I wish I wasn't lame
Last year they didn't fuck with me, but now they know my name
Girl I got what you want, I got whatever you need (whatever you need)
I'm pissin' out these pills, and I'm cryin' codeine (I'm cryin' codeine)
The shit I used to buy, now I be gettin' for free (for free)
Girl right next to you is where I wanna be (where I wanna be, yeah)

[Chorus: NAV and Quavo]
Have some faith in me, yeah
Baby just wait on me, yeah
I've been hittin' all these hoes but none of them datin' me, yeah
Ain't no fakin' me out
The drugs, they takin' me up
Don't know where I'm gonna go if you don't wait on me, yeah
Have some faith in me, yeah
Baby just wait on me, yeah
I've been hittin' all these hoes but none of them datin' me, yeah
Ain't no fakin' me out
The drugs, they takin' me up (Huncho!)
Don't know where I'm gonna go if you don't wait on me, yeah

[Verse 2: Quavo]
I gave them both the keys, made them race to me yeah
(Skrt skrt, Huncho)
Nawfside the place to be, come and play with me yeah, yeah
(Nawf, nawfside)
Drippin' all this water, don't drown (drip, splash)
Told 'em, move this work across town (work, work)
I know youâ€™re a lil bit scared but it's okay now (it's okay)
And when you get back home, put your face down
Ass up, the bags up, the fam us
That mean we famous (damn), and it won't change us (yeah)
Have some faith (faith), got big boy sticks we safe (safe, safe)
Don't play with the gang (Migos) he gon' die today

[Chorus: NAV]
Have some faith in me, yeah
Baby just wait on me, yeah
I've been hittin' all these hoes but none of them datin' me, yeah
Ain't no fakin' me out
The drugs, they takin' me up
Don't know where I'm gonna go if you don't wait on me, yeah
Have some faith in me, yeah
Baby just wait on me, yeah
I've been hittin' all these hoes but none of them datin' me, yeah
Ain't no fakin' me out
The drugs, they takin' me up
Don't know where I'm gonna go if you don't wait on me, yeah
