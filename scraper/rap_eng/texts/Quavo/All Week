[Intro: Migo Domingo]
What’s happenin’ JerZ?
Ay what you been doing bro?

[Hook: Migo JerZ]
I been in the trap, all week
Finessing country niggas, servin’ fiends
I been in the trap, all week
Walkin’ ‘round, drinking Act and I can’t sleep
Don’t ask me where I’m at
Cause bitch I’m in the trap
Don’t ask me where I’m at
Cause bitch I’m flippin’ packs
Don’t ask me where I’m at
Cause bitch I’m in the trap
Don’t ask me where I’m at
Cause bitch I’m flippin’ packs

[Verse 1: Quavo]
Me and JerZ posted on the curb
Me and JerZ we be in the trap
Me and JerZ, yeah we keep a strap
Big pistols hanging on our lap
Hundred racks nigga, what’s up?
Hundred bands nigga, what’s up?
Pussy nigga get your bags up
Cause me and JerZ fuck the city up
Me and JerZ fuckin’ all the hoes
Hit the dab, people elbow
I got the work for the L-O
Shoot a nigga like Carmelo
I got more dollars than [?]
Pluck a nigga like a cello
They say you be drinking on yellow
My ice thirty below zero
Woah, trap this nigga
Trap that nigga
Wrap this nigga
Wrap that nigga
Get your issue nigga
Get your pistol nigga
White like tissue nigga
Don’t wanna get you nigga

[Hook: Migo JerZ]
I been in the trap, all week
Finessing country niggas, servin’ fiends
I been in the trap, all week
Walkin’ ‘round, drinking Act and I can’t sleep
Don’t ask me where I’m at
Cause bitch I’m in the trap
Don’t ask me where I’m at
Cause bitch I’m flippin’ packs
Don’t ask me where I’m at
Cause bitch I’m in the trap
Don’t ask me where I’m at
Cause bitch I’m flippin’ packs

[Verse 2: Mango Foo]
I’m in the trap, it be all week
24/7, no time to sleep
Serve you the first time I meet you, no meeting
When we in the hood I meet you at the Busy Bee
They be itching for dope like some fleas
Make my [?] taste it, the dope I give ‘em a tease
If you late on the payment I’m adding a fee
Remix you with work then you know it’s OV
We got the bando jumping like a trampoline
We selling fishscale but no Captain D’s
I got O’s but no Krispy Kreme
Getting robbed clean just like Listerine
Migo JerZ posted on the curb with the hammer
Pop the seal on the Act then pour up in the Fanta
Watch out for the robbers when you in Atlanta
[?] pull up, serve you out a Phantom
If you a monkey nigga, we got bananas
I got bricks in the Hummer, got keys in the Challenger
Pull up with the white like I’m riding ‘round with Pamela
Trapping every day, it fill up the Chalenger
Feds on alert, I can’t move like no amateur
Mango the sniper, shoot you from the bannister
I make the work disappear and it’s magical
I’m an artist but I still serve your manager

[Hook: Migo JerZ]
I been in the trap, all week
Finessing country niggas, servin’ fiends
I been in the trap, all week
Walkin’ ‘round, drinking Act and I can’t sleep
Don’t ask me where I’m at
Cause bitch I’m in the trap
Don’t ask me where I’m at
Cause bitch I’m flippin’ packs
Don’t ask me where I’m at
Cause bitch I’m in the trap
Don’t ask me where I’m at
Cause bitch I’m flippin’ packs

[Verse 3: Migo Domingo]
Percocet, cookie, drank, (lean, lean)
Molly Santan (grits)
Wrap it up, whip it, cook it (cook it)
Domingo Uncle Sam (tax)
Stack it, flip it, I get it (money)
I’m talkin’ bout them bands (racks)
Choppers, Glocks, and 30s
Or you can see me with them hands, nigga
I been in the trap all week
Run it up, get no sleep
Everybody on my team eat
Got it if you see me in the streets
Like D-Wade, catch me with the heat
I got two rings, I need a three peat
Foreign whip, only two seats
I’m in the game with a cheat sheet
Me and Migo JerZ on the curb
At the bando whippin’ up the birds
Pull up in a Lambo, watch for the swerve
Down for a kick door, tell ‘em what’s the word
Want a point five then you ain’t getting served
All these J’s at my door getting on my nerves
Bought two pints of Act, nigga fuck his and hers
Poured up an eight now a nigga’s words slurred

[Hook: Migo JerZ]
I been in the trap, all week
Finessing country niggas, servin’ fiends
I been in the trap, all week
Walkin’ ‘round, drinking Act and I can’t sleep
Don’t ask me where I’m at
Cause bitch I’m in the trap
Don’t ask me where I’m at
Cause bitch I’m flippin’ packs
Don’t ask me where I’m at
Cause bitch I’m in the trap
Don’t ask me where I’m at
Cause bitch I’m flippin’ packs

[Outro: Migo Domingo]
We started from the Nawf
Trapping out of vacants
We call it the bando
Boards on the windows
We ain’t never really do the trap spots
War Ready 2
Bitch!
