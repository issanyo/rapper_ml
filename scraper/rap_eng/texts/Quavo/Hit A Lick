[Hook: Waka Flocka Flame]
I hit a lick for two hundred
I put half of that on kush
I put thirty thou in dope
I put twenty thou in molly
I got fifty thousand [?]
I'm gon' throw ten bands tonight
I got forty thousand left
I'ma catch a private flight
I hit a lick for two hundred
I put half of that on kush
I put thirty thou in dope
I put twenty thou in molly
I got fifty thousand [?]
I'm gon' throw ten bands tonight
I got forty thousand left
I'ma catch a private flight

[Verse 1: Waka Flocka Flame]
You shouldn't never treated me like a rap nigga
Flexin' like he really got them stacks, nigga
So I flexed him like I really had the patch, nigga
Took off soon as them bands hit my lap, nigga
[?] show a nigga one stay strapped nigga
My flag red, drinking yellow lean
Smoke a lot of green, traffic light
I'm sleep walking high as a kite
I'm sellin' pussy, [?]
On G status, till down to fight
Hittin' licks til the hood get right
Real [?] real Pyru
[?] til my casket drop
Got the barrel melting on this plastic Glock
Better think twice before he talks to cops
Tie you up in that Chris Rock
Treat this industry like a dope [?]
Turn your [?] to my kush spot
Waka Flock, I'm hip-hop

[Verse 2: Quavo]
Young nigga, you know we trap out the bendo
Got gas, got molly, we rep it up pronto
Passing out nothin' but OG like I'm Rondo
The fuck nigga [?]
My nigga [?]
My nigga [?]
Remember having dime bags in my cargo
Feels of marijuana like [?]
You can't see my guys, I got [?]
Try that shit, one of you niggas gon' die
I'm cookin' up, this ain't no chicken pot pie
My niggas having extendos and nines
They knew that boy right there was one of a kind
The way I was droppin' birds and dimes
Remix a nigga, reverse your mind
We put the North on the map
Way before Migos, nobody noticed it
We could've been at the trap, way before didn't nobody notice it
I know you think this shit a shocker
Beat the pot like Ibaka
Shoot a nigga with binoculars
For fucking with Migos and Flocka
