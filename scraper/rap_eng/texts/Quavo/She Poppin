All this money that she got me throwing
Bout to take her ass to the back
Well known temperament certain

I'ma eat your pussy, just don't tell nobody
Had to do it like that
Type to make me want to buy her
Bag (?) my thumb in her ass
Pussy print we in this back
Type of shit to make you come on earn it
Got a nigga, is he worth it?
I just figure that you'd leave with me
I'd let your live in the mansion
The lips that you're giving me

Smoking on cookie pack
She's acting like she can't get cool with that (no)
You got to live with that (no)
Cause girl that's my habitat (habitat)

Nasty sex in the driveway
