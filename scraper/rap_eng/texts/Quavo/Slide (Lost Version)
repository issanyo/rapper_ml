[Intro: Frank Ocean]
I might
Empty my bank account
And buy that boy with a pipe
Buy that boy with a pipe
I might, I might
Empty my bank account
And buy that boy with a pipe
Buy that boy with a pipe
I might

[Intro 2: Quavo]
Nighttime, the spotlight
Don't stop at the red light
I love when it's midnight (midnight)
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Make sure we shine bright (shine bright)
G5 now the red eye
You can watch me in the sky, yeah, yeah

[Chorus: Frank Ocean]
Do you slide on all your nights like this?
Do you try on all your nights like this? (I might)
Put some spotlight on the slide
Whatever comes, comes through clear
Do you slide on all your nights like this?
Do you try on all your nights like this? (I might)
Put some spotlight on the side
And whatever comes, comes through clear

[Verse 1: Frank Ocean]
All this jewelry ain't no use when it's this dark
It's my favorite part, we see the lights, they got so far
It went too fast, we couldn't reach it with our arms
Wrist on a wrist, a link of charms, yeah
Laying, we're still a link apart
It's like we could die here all young
Like we could dye hair all blonde
If we could see in twenty twin
Twice we could see it 'til the end (I might)

[Verse 2: Takeoff]
Smile at you (smile) I got my eyes on you (eyes)
I wanna climb on you
Can I ride with you? (can I?) touch the sky with you? (phew)
A-huh-huh-huh-huh
Say the place and we go where you wanna go (where?)
She say Rodeo, I say I'm thinking 'bout Tokyo (Tokyo)
With the top gone, won't turn up the stereo (stereo)
Singing every word of my song that's on radio (aye)
I'ma roll one, I know that you don't smoke (I know)
Sit back, let your mind float (phew) never give up hope (no)
And if ya got a problem, let me know (let me know)
I try my best to keep you close
The life we in, no boss to match 'em on the ropes (ooh)
If I'm top ten, to win, I gotta be the GOAT (GOAT)
I feel like when I step in (what?) gotta make an announcement
But y'all know (but y'all know)

[Chorus: Frank Ocean]
Do you slide on all your nights like this?
Do you try on all your nights like this? (I might)
Put some spotlight on the slide
Whatever comes, comes through clear
Do you slide on all your nights like this?
Do you try on all your nights like this?
Put some spotlight on the side
And whatever comes, comes through clear (I might)

[Outro: Frank Ocean]
I might empty my bank account (ooh)
And buy that boy with a pipe (ooh, yeah)
Buy that boy with a pipe
I might, I might (slide)
Empty my bank account (ooh, slide)
And buy that boy with a pipe (slide, yeah)
(Do you slide on all your nights like this?)
Buy that boy with a pipe
I might
