Always handle my business

Bigger than them

I'm just telling my story
As soon as I wake
I'm praying
The Mula

She be kissing my body
Told her to stop

Thank God

Verse 2
I'm aiming for Oscar's
I'm a go getter
If i have a daughter
Her life gonna be better

And he send me a letter
I just make music
Don't listen to haters
If I get money
Im donating paper

Bridge 2
Cause God
Told me to
You dont know

All day with no food
What do you mean
Life is good
Wanna be hot
Not cool
Wanna be me
Not you
Not them

Verse 3
I don't need no money
For happiness
When they talk
I ain't listening
No rubber
For my mistakes
Go and get
All my Mixtapes
I'm swimming
With no boat In my deck
I stack it I stack it
Then I stack it back
When I get home
I'm bringing a cheque

Bridge
I said that once
And I'll say it again
I don't rap for money
I don't sing for fame
And I wrote this
On the bus again
Yeah Yeah
So
Pick up the phone baby
Yeah Yeah

Verse 5
I'm a major key
No philosophy
On my snap
I go photography
Stay away
From pornography
Love The Earth
Call me geography
Never quit
I'm a nominee
This rap game
Ain't a cup of tea
I'ma sing it out
Get it lyrical
Pray for her
If she emotional
I pray for bands
In my future wallet
2 years later
Imma need a bucket
I'm the plag
Aka the socket
Yeah Yeah

Bridge
I got bars
In my mind
And your girl
In my head
Like the giraffe
I lift my head

Outro
Then I trap it
And rap it
I am EASY
Young Taven
I cut it and cut it
Till I make it

Hook
Pick up the phone baby
Ohhh
I need to talk lady
Yeahhh
I know it's getting crazy
Ohhh
So pick up the phone baby
Pick Up The Phone
Pick up the phone

Pick up the phone baby
Yeah Yeah Yeahhh
I need to talk lady
Ohhh
I know it's getting crazy
Yeah Yeah
So pick up the phone baby
Pick up the phone
Pick up the phone
