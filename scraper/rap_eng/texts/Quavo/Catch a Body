[Intro: Quavo]
Yeah, girl you look so good
And your body say you feelin' me
And I came from the hood
So you know I brought some friends with me

[Verse 1: LIVVIA]
Boy you went and got that poison on
And I feel like I can taste ya
It's like a million tiny paper cuts
Oh you’re sharp like diamonds

I like what it feels like
Take your aim, baby let the bullets fly
Oh, boy you got that poison on
Oh, damn your type of way is strong
And now I know

[Pre-Chorus: LIVVIA]
The way you look is murder on my eyes
If looks could kill then damn I think I’ve died
You look so good it's, you look so good it's
Killin' me, killin' me

[Chorus]
Hold a body, catch a body
Hold a body, catch a body damn
Hold a body, catch a body
Cause you look so good, it's killin' me, killin' me

[Quavo]
Don't mind catch a body

[LIVVIA]
Cause you look so good, it's killin' me, killin' me
Mmm, hold a body, catch a body
Cause you look so good, it's killin' me, killin' me

[Verse 2: LIVVIA]
The way you whippin’ in that Tesla
Got me trippin’ like I’m J-Law
I’m attracted to your danger
Take me somewhere stranger

I like what it feels like
Call a friend, you gon’ need an alibi
Oh, fingers wrapped my neck
Whatchu doin’ yea keep doin’ it
And now I know

[Pre-Chorus: LIVVIA]
The way you look is murder on my eyes
If looks could kill then damn I think I’ve died
You look so good it's, you look so good it's
Killin’ me, killin’ me

[Chorus]

[Quavo]
Don't mind catch a body

[LIVVIA]
Cause you look so good, it's killin' me, killin' me
Mmm, Hold a body, catch a body
Cause you look so good, it's killin' me, killin' me

[Quavo]
Yea, girl you look so good
And your body say you’re feelin’ me
And I came from the hood
So you know I brought some friends with me
Hey, drop top on ‘em
Hey yup, Fox Five on ‘em
Ayyy yea, don’t stop on ‘em
Catch a body, catch a body, we ‘gon slide on ‘em
Issa vibe, yeah
C'mon take em on a ride, yeah
She wanna live up in the skies, yeah
I told her catch me outside, yeah
You would think I caught a body in a bando
And she makin’ too much noise in her nice coat
Hit it with my eyes that’s an iso
Cause you look so good, it's killin' me, killin' me!

[Quavo]
Don't mind catch a body

[Quavo & LIVVIA]
Cause you look so good, it's killin' me, killin' me
Catch a body, catch a body
Mmm, hold a body, catch a body
Catch a body, catch a body
Cause you look so good, it's killin' me, killin' me
