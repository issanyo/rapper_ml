Hook) these niggas want me dead but I can't go
Hit the strip joint let the bands go
Look at all this money I done ran through
They wanna see my dead but I can't go

They wanna see me dead cos I got fame now
Niggas get a couple dollars and they change how
Nina always on my side it'll blow ya brains out
Gotta keep my circle tight and keep the lames out
Smoke so much dope I can't breath like I'm drowning
Sip so much hennessy my head pounding
House arrest a keep a nigga in the crib like he grounded
Gotta get this dough at the top like a mountain
Gang banging
Phone ranging
Name ringing
Bells
O well, bitch its lud foe but I never take a L

Verse 2) quavo) Thanks to Versace I'm at the top like rocky
QC the label can't drop me

While I'm swerving in the outti
Then I'm piping no Scotty
I mean pipping don't flock me
