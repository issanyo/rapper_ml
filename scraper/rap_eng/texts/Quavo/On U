[Hook: Young Greatness]
I pull on the block, then I shit on you niggas (x4)
Pull on the block, then I shit on you niggas (x8)

[Verse 1: Quavo]
(Quavo talk to 'em!)
I pull on the block, and I shit on you niggas
I'm smoking on Backwoods, nigga you can have the Swishers
Pull up on your block in a dropped Audi
Look at mamacita with the bad body
Look at my chain, it got icicles
It ain't nothing to pull and just shit on you niggas
I'm getting sick of you niggas
I'm getting rid of you niggas
Touchdown on a nigga
Blue Benjamins thumb through it with your finger
Cameras flashing like my Beamer blinking
Put my wrist in the water, my hand it be sinking
I might jump in the water, young Quavo start sinking
Cause' my jewelry so heavy, just look at the pieces

[Hook: Young Greatness]
I pull on the block, then I shit on you niggas (x4)
Pull on the block, then I shit on you niggas (x8)

[Verse 2: Young Greatness]
I'm in a brand new Rolls Royce
Stomp hard on a bitch nigga
And my wrist shine bright boy, better watch your bitch nigga
Pocket full of money baby
Stand on the block [?] crazy
We flexing bout' ten in our Rari's
We flexing bout' ten in our Rolls'
She fucking and sucking, she rolling
We balling, we standing on sofas
I shit on a bitch nigga
My youngins, they young and they rich nigga
We shine lil' woe
[?] nigga with me got a lot of cash
Ever since I get, watch a nigga stunt hard on your broke ass


[Hook: Young Greatness]
I pull on the block, then I shit on you niggas (x4)
Pull on the block, then I shit on you niggas (x8)
