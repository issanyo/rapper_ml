[Intro: PARTYNEXTDOOR]
Ferina
They don't know, now they know
I've been too busy getting money
I've been too busy playing these games that they play
That they want to play with me

M-m-m-Murda

[Hook: Quavo & PARTYNEXTDOOR]
She tell that I ball from the whole shmoney, ayy
You can't win a ring when you only pay ya rent
When you win a ring I'mma keep you on the team
When you win a ring I'mma keep you on the team

On the team, baby (woho woho)

[Verse 1: PARTYNEXTDOOR]
Range Rover, Range Rover
Seventeen in a Ranger Rover
Seventeen and she came over
That's why I'm that nigga right now
Pull up in that, pshhh, right now
In that, pshhh, I ain't know (ayy, ayy)
Come away in that [?} right now
PARTY is a wave when the tides die down
You don't know
How many can you tell that you slipped
You've been here and you been there, done that (whoa, whoa)
IG models, been there, been done that
I need [?]
She up in the Trey house, come to Drake house
And Chris house, [?]

[Verse 2: Quavo]
Spend the next night over PARTY house
Then she turn around and wanna lay in my house
No, she wanna ring, 'lil mama just wanna be champion
She want a ring, don't give me your heart
I promise, I promise, I'll damage it
Don't give me your heart
I was growed up and raised by savages (savages, savages)
And I was trained, just to go chase the cabbages, ayy
Damn, my hand got callusesYou too old when you fuck up the CLS (smash!)
I got five hoes in my palace
Drinking on fake lean, now you got dialysis (damn)
Put this bitch on more mileage
Got her late for her class in college
Even though the pussy, yeah, got mileage
When I get it, yeah I'm dabbing and styling

[Outro: PARTYNEXTDOOR & Quavo]
Shawty thought she want a baller now she like "No, no, no"
Shawty thought that a nigga wouldn't call her
Now I'm like "Whoa, whoa, whoa"
If I want that, I'mma get that
Get that, get that, uhh
If I want that, I'mma get that
If I want that, I'mma get that, oh yeah
If I want that, I'mma get that, oh yeah
I'm 'gone make her put it all on me, baby
I'm 'gone make her put it all on me, baby
I'm 'gone make her put it all on me, baby
I'm 'gone make her put it all on me, baby
