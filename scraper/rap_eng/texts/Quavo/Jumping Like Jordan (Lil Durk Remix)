[Verse 1 : Lil Durk]
Trap house jumping like Jeremy
Can't lend a bitch none of this money
Spent 28 sacks for showing these racks
And the trap house jumping like Jordan
Savages, savages, savages
Trickin' off to a bitch I ain't having it
100 p's I ain't talking about whip
But I got a couple whips that we use for the trafficking
Lot of gold, lot of guns, lot of 'sace
Name ring got everybody watching
Turn your bitch to a fan now she starting
Dope smoke got the dope smelling rotten
"Uhh!" Jugg! Molly, water
Jugg! Jugg! I pull up like "Uhh! Uhh!"
Thinkin' I'm a bull, "Uhh!" I say "Uhh!"
In the trap, in the trap, in the trap
No rap then it's back to the trap
Lean got a nigga wanna nap
"Dis Ain't What U Want" got a nigga on the map
No seatbelt but a nigga stay strap
I'm straight in the city running laps
One nighter off a pill I'mma bite her
Fuck who don't like us, 300 where it's at

[Hook : Rich The Kid]
Got the trap house jumping like Jordan
Pull up in a brand new foreign
300 hundred on the dash, and a paycheck cash
Take off on you niggas, Jeff Gordon
AP, it cost me fifty
Model ho, yeah she with me
Living life like I’m Diddy
In the kitchen with Whitney
Got the trap house jumping like Jordan
Trap house jumping like Jordan
Got the trap house jumping like Jordan
Trap house jumping like Jordan
Ap, it cost me fifty
Model ho, yeah she with me
Living life like I’m Diddy
In the kitchen with Whitney

[Verse 2 : Quavo]
Yeah, Yeah trap house jumping like Jordan
J's in the hood, they’re snorting
Double cup, lean, I’m pouring
Your bitch whipping in the early morning
Pulled up in the drop top phantom
Niggas in the hood can’t stand it
Whip game is so special
I’m whipping at the whole grand canyon
I got Molly, I got white, Marilyn Mason!
I went to the jeweler, cashed out on a new piece, now my diamonds dancing
Your bitch think I’m romantic
My coca game is frantic
My whip game make you panic
My plug is Phil Jackson
Feeling like Mutombo, I got all the Kush bowls
Juuggin' at the Texaco, you smoking on Reginald
Trap game, Elvis Presley, you can’t impress me
Dark skinned ho, cook up the dope, she look like Nestle
Gone!

[Hook]

[Verse 3 : Rich The Kid]
Got the trap house jumping like Kobe
Cashed out 100K on a Rollie
You don't want it with me nigga, don’t talk to me nigga
I'mma real ass nigga, you phony!
In the kitchen whipping up them babies
And the pyrex trap go crazy
Young nigga got money, young nigga got work
Young nigga got crack like the 80s
I’m winning, I’m winning, I’m dunking, I’m dunking
I’m Jordan, you not even Kobe
In the kitchen with the pyrex pot
Water whipping and the pot too hot
Drinking lean, out the bottle
In a Aston Martin, foreign with a model
So many racks on me, got tats on me
In the bed with 6 hoes like 2 x 3

[Hook]

[Verse 4 : TakeOff]
Trap house jumpin' like Jordan
I’m a free man, no Morgan!
That choppa, it takes out your organs
I play with them keys, no organ!
Bitch in my kitchen, she snorting
The lean, I’m pouring, I'm snoring
I’m making them plays in Delaware
Versace, Medusa my underwear
Who the fuck, nigga better have help
You don't trap on the block if you dont live there
The trap be jumping, and bunking
The fiends they running, the money keep coming
I'm kicking hoes out like a punter
If I start shooting, turn to a track runner
I'm calling up rich, he bringing the kids
Whipping the babies all summer

[Hook]
