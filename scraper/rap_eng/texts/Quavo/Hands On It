Migo, oh...
Woo
Why you gotta act like it ain't TWRK

[Hook: Sayyi]
Truth be told, got a boy gone
From the way that you's on it
Heard 'bout how you like to get lit right now, and I'm on it
My hands they just rubbin' on you like I own it
I will be right there for you, when I wanna put my hands on it

[Bridge]
Hands on it (Right there)
Hands on it (Right there)
Hands on it (Right there)
Hands on it (Break it down)
Hands on it
Hands on it
Rubbin' on you like I own it

[Verse 1: Takeoff & Quavo]
Lil mama bounce that ass to the beat and let me see it
Smokin' OG, poppin' bottles in the Migos VIP
All these Cuban links up on me lookin' like I'm Mr. T
Dabbin' in fashion, I'm having Benjamin's fucking on me
My bitch she poppin', now stop it, she poppin' it
I'm throwing up money, I'm smoking on broccoli (gas!)
She hot man, I know she got a fever
Bounce that ass to the beat and to the speaker
50 bottles over here, yeah serve (50 bottles)
Then I'm drunk, drivin' 'bout to hit the curb (curb)
Who got me fucked up, I'm too fucked up
If you fucked up like me put your cups up
You lookin' at me wrong, you got me fucked up
Order up some ones my nigga and throw the money up
I take your bitch I'm fucking your bitch my nigga you cuddle up
Drop a 4 in the soda my nigga watch it bubble up

[Verse 2: Sage The Gemini]
Hey, when a rich nigga want you
You gon' pay attention to that nigga won't you?
He don't got that money, then you diss a nigga don't you?
But if he throw that money, then you stick with niggas don't you?
In here scoping these Tinders
Make that ass shake like Weight Watch members
Make it all fall, while I yell timber
And we gon' have a ball like Melo on Denver
She gon' drop it down have you seen it
That booty on fire like a phoenix
Excuse me while I am looking at your anus cause you got a booty like Venus
That ass up, you know she low
I'm tryna swim and find Nemo
Go [?] like Dory
You know them other girls boring

[Hook: Sayyi]
