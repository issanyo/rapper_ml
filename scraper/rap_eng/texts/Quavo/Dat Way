[Intro: Quavo]
Yo, yeah, Dat Way
I mean, you know this not a diss record
I don't sneak diss
This just for the record, just facts

[Pre-Hook: Quavo]
Your artists be taking my swag
I wonder If I can come take some of yours
When I go get a new Bentley I just want to double park it on the curb
We got the key to the city
You niggas ain't heard, you niggas ain't heard
Lil Yachty brought back us some milli's
It's time to go splurge, it's time to go splurge

[Hook: Quavo]
Uh, yeah, Dat Way
Pick up the phone and call Kanye (brr-tt)
Uh, yeah, Dat Way
Told him put The Huncho on the runway
Uh, yeah, Dat Way
The plug pull up on me anyday
He told me pull up to his mansion alone
And don't come in with all that gun play

[Bridge: Quavo]
Your artists be taking my swag
I wonder if I could come take some of yours
Your artists be taking my swag
I wonder if I could come take some of yours
Your artists be taking my swag
I wonder if I could come take some of yours
Your artists be taking my swag

[Verse 1: Takeoff]
Double park, double park, parallel park
Then I pick up that Backwood and spark
So many artist, can't even say rappers, done picked up the flow
I don't know where to start
Shopping cart when I go pick up my narcs
So many animals like Noah's Arc
Hop on the chart' and I pop me a Percocet, pour me a fo' befo' it can depart
I land in Cali, my plug pull up on me with pints of the Act
I  don't want no Wockhardt
Make your hoe ride along with me
Got unfinished business, got me feeling like Kevin Hart
Back up, that camera pop out when I park
I got that Draco, come out after dark
Niggas gon' act like they 'bout that life, 'til you pull up on them, see that it's not in their heart
The nigga you think be the coolest  a groupie, he put on a act like he shooting a movie
Kicked them with fashion, I'm talking my dab and they thought it was Newton, then you must be stupid
Trick that bitch make her trap for me like Lucy
We got the keys to the street, I gotta use it
Pull up in my mansion, the crib is extended
The bitches, my nigga, I'm feeling like Pookie
Dat Way, dab at the runway
Got me running to the M&M's, I'm thinking it's a rat race
Ya main bitch on backpage
I pull up with a 'Yonce Lemonade
Migos performing up at the Barclays
J's test the dope, said it was Parkay
I been trapping, it's a long day
We the ones that brought these niggas to the game

[Pre-Hook: Quavo]
Your artists be taking my swag
I wonder If I can come take some of yours
When I go get a new Bentley I just want to double park it on the curb
We got the key to the city
You niggas ain't heard, you niggas ain't heard?
Lil Yachty brought back us some milli's
It's time to go splurge, it's time to go splurge

[Verse 2: Rich The Kid]
Dat Way
My bitch is bad and boujee
Calabasas, I was trapping in Coogi
Blue cheese drop a 50 in Gucci
Wipe my red bottoms down like I'm Boosie
Dat Way
We could make a movie like a matinee
In the kitchen with the white like mayonnaise
Pull up on the plug like Dat Way
This for the culture, stay with the bird like a vulture
Play with my niggas, put you on a poster
Dat Way
Maserati matte black, getting head on a good day
When I go get the new Bentley I just wanna flex on my bitch, she a bird
Yeah, Dat Way
Pick up the phone and call Tunechi
