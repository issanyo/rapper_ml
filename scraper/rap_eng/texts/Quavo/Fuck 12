[Intro: Malcolm X]
We are denied not only civil rights, but even human rights. So the only way we're going to get some of this exploitation away from us, or aside from us... Who taught you to hate the race that you belong to? So much so that you don't want to be around each other. Who taught you to hate the texture of your hair? Who taught you to hate the color of your skin?

[Verse 1: Quavo]
Fabrics, fabrics (Whoo)
Expensive, linen (Linen)
Put that bitch in the kitchen, in the kitchen whippin' (Yaa)
Back in the days, I was doin' lord willin' (Hey)
Mama gonna kill me, double cup spillin' (Spillin')
Every time I get the hundo, Will I'm trippin' (Trippin')
Every time your bitch phone rings she workin' (brr-brr)
Get no playin' time, Kendrick Perkins (Ayy)
Rockin' Timbs like I'm in New Jersey (Jersey)
Dubs versus Hawks, took off KD jersey (KD)
And he scored a 30
Up real early (Early), servin', servin', servin'
Fuck that bitch, she a virgin (Smash)
Said she had to go to work, she was nursin' (Nursin')
I can turn the pot to the armed service (Armed)
I declare war on your whole 30 (30)
Choppa hold a hunnid
If I wasn't real, I would be a hunnid (Hunnid)
So that mean everything authentic ('Thentic)
Every car I get, windows presidented (Presidented)

[Verse 2: Offset]
Knocking at the door, bail (12, 12)
Cookin' up the dope, Ro-tel (Dope, dope, cookin')
You can get a whole wholesale (Wholesale)
Fuck 12, 12 on my coattails (Fuck 12)
They hatin', contemplatin' on the money (Hey), I'm makin'
First niggas trappin' out the bando (Bando), you fakin'
Karate chop the brick, cut it up, Ninja Gaiden (Waa)
Go and get the re-up, out the buck, not later (Go)
Kickin' my feet up, the J wanna eat up (Kick)
Your bitch addicted to this drip like a needle (Addict)
Detective on my back, just took my money, I'm illegal (12)
Shootin' at the pigs, they been killin' all our people (Pig)
Young, rich, black, got my mama on my back (Mama)
Daddy disappeared when my mama took him back (Grandma)
You shot him 'cause you thought he had a gun or he black (Woo)
You better watch out for the boys when you're black (Woo-whoo)

[Verse 3: Quavo]
I'm doin' just what I wanna (For real)
Don't believe me, bet a hundred (Bet it)
Bet a nigga won't go under (Bet it)
Huncho realest out the jungle (Huncho)
I got the bricks from Wakanda (Bricks)
Them boys did the block over yonder (Skrr)
12 tried to pull a young nigga over (Brrt)
One call to my mama
'Cause I'm black (Mama), I don't know how to act (Nah)
Fuck the front seat, I go sit in the back
'Cause I'm black (Black), I don't know how to act
Double my cup and pour yak (Martell)
'Cause I'm black, I don't give a fuck about that
You judging me off the face tats (Whoa)
And I'm black (Black)
Whips on my back (Whip), got me the whips out back (Whoo)

[Chorus: Quavo]

[Outro: Quavo, Malcolm X & others]
Hands up, don't shoot

Hands up, don't shoot (Fuck 'em)
Hands up, don't shoot (Fuck 'em)
Hands up, don't shoot (Fuck 'em)
Hands up, don't shoot
(Fuck 'em, fuck 'em, fuck 'em, fuck 'em)
We are being killed every day
This gon' be your life every day
You gon' get tired of this shit before we do
You can ask yourself who taught you to hate being what God made you
Fuck 'em
Fuck 'em
