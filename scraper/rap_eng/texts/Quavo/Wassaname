[Hook: Shy Glizzy]
Ain't that right that wassaname (goddamn)
We pull up in that wassaname (skrrt, skrrtt)
We smoking on that wassaname
Boy, you got all that wassaname
Wassaname, wassa wassaname (wassaname)
Wassaname, wassa wassaname (wassaname)
Wassaname, wassa wassaname (wassaname)
Wassaname, wassa wassaname (wassaname)

[Verse 1: Shy Glizzy]
A 4-5 in the big thirty
My pockets feel like Big Shirley
These rap niggas be Tyler Perry
My bitch, she look like Haley Berry
My diamond shine like rainbow
Got all types of ammo
Keep squares out my triangle
Chopper make you do the limbo
More stripes than a footlocker
Black and silver ruger, shoot like Tony Parker
Yo bitch addicted to this bottle (swish, swish)
She go round and round like a helicopter

[Hook: Shy Glizzy]
Ain't that right that wassaname(goddamn)
We pull up in that wassaname(skrrt, skrrtt)
We smoking all that wassaname
Boy, you got all that wassaname
Wassaname, wassa wassaname(wassaname)

[Verse 2: Quavo]
Smash your bitch and I don't know her name
My plug came from China Town, he look like Jackie Chan
Ain't that right that wassaname, he say he got that heavy K
Now we skrrt off in the wassaname
Young rich nigga 20 karat gold pistol
If I wanna to go get you I just blow a whistle
All my niggas keep automatic sticks, rah rah
Pirates of the Caribbean, got a Johnny wrist

[Hook: Shy Glizzy]
Ain't that right that wassaname(goddamn)
We pull up in that wassaname(skrrt, skrrtt)
We smoking all that wassaname
Boy, you got all that wassaname
Wassaname, wassa wassaname(wassaname)

[Verse 3: Takeoff]
Finessing the plug with cocaine
Telephone call, finesse on layer
And I ain't no pull(?), look at them think
Better be whipping, I dunno her name
Better get thigh, that shit be whipped
Know how to cook up a brick
Good for the chicken, she good with the ticket
And twelve grown men still get with the fit
I got rolling stones in my way
Real diamonds in my chain
Niggas get Macs, I fuck 'em

[Hook: Shy Glizzy]
Ain't that right that wassaname(goddamn)
We pull up in that wassaname(skrrt, skrrtt)
We smoking on that wassaname
Boy, you got all that wassaname
Wassaname, wassa wassaname(wassaname)
