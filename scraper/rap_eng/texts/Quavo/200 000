[Chorus: Quavo]
I got more keys than Alicia
These niggas be talkin' policemen
I take your hoe then released her
I used to trap out a Regal
200 000 on my wrist
I thought it all was a fantasy
200 000 on my wrist
Lord I hope it don't vanish
200 000 on my wrist
I told my mama don't panic
200 000 on my wrist
I bought a heat with a dragon
200 000 on my wrist
Who thought I would be living life like this?
200 000 on my wrist
You probably thought I couldn't buy this shit

[Verse 1: Quavo]
Wrsit drownin' in the water
Trappin' early, Tom Joyner
Beat the pot, George Foremann
J's go nuts, acornin'
Look at me now I'm soarin'
Look at the lean I'm pourin'
Come get your hoe she annoyin'
We toss her up like a coin
24 hours, geekin' on the tower
Shooting at you cowards, 'cause my wrist 200 000
If a nigga try to take it
I swear to God, he ain't gon' make it
Back to the bando, the basics
Seein' green numbers, The Matrix
Look at that boy with the ice on
Catch him playing, Jerry Rice on him
I know niggas that'd get ya nigga
If a nigga put the right price on him
Remember the days on the North Side
Hit for a rack on a dice on it
Now I take the mic and stand on the stage
A P-p-p-p-p-pipe on
And if you lookin' at me wrong
I got some niggas that's right on 'em
All of these flawless stones
I bet your hoe gon' bite on 'em
Smoking the gas, gettin' rid of the pain
You might think that I got glaucoma
Niggas thinking that I'm serving the J's
'Cause I'm walking with these rocks on me

[Chorus: Quavo]
I got more keys than Alicia
These niggas be talkin' policemen
I take your hoe then released her
I used to trap out a Regal
200 000 on my wrist
I thought it all was a fantasy
200 000 on my wrist
Lord I hope it don't vanish
200 000 on my wrist
I told my mama don't panic
200 000 on my wrist
I bought a heat with a dragon
200 000 on my wrist
Who thought I would be living life like this?
200 000 on my wrist
You probably thought I couldn't buy this shit

[Verse 2: Lil Uzi Vert]
White diamonds on my neck
White diamonds on my fist
I just got a white bitch
And she whippin' up the brick
In that trap car got that motor
I do not want that lil' bitch
If that bitch is really not a deep throater
Ayy, told that bitch eat up my oldest
Ayy, yah, she said that dick just like pole
Yah, I just keep pitchin' her ride like a floater
Yah, mixin' the lean with cream soda
Young nigga but my money gettin' older
Look at these bitches they tellin' on me
Where my lil bitch, she like so what
Look at my money that's L-O-V-E
Smoking that gas like a stoner
Nowadays fuckin' my bitches in threes
Ayy, remember I'm watching TV, ayy
Nowadays I'm on TV, ayy
Migos and Thugga baby, yah

[Interlude: Lil Uzi Vert]
I just be countin' Gs
I feel like I am so beast
I got them Alicia Keys
I got them Alicia Keys
I got them Alicia Keys
I got them Alicia Keys

[Chorus: Quavo]
I got more keys than Alicia
These niggas be talkin' policemen
I take your hoe then released her
I used to trap out a Regal
200 000 on my wrist
I thought it all was a fantasy
200 000 on my wrist
Lord I hope it don't vanish
200 000 on my wrist
I told my mama don't panic
200 000 on my wrist
I bought a heat with a dragon
200 000 on my wrist
Who thought I would be living life like this?
200 000 on my wrist
You probably thought I couldn't buy this shit

[Verse 3: Shad da God]
100 000 on my wrist
Bustin' at you, lil bitch
I just poured a lil Drizzy Drake
I just poured a lil six (that mud)
I be lettin' a bag go for Blake
32 in that seal (Blake Griffin)
They be feelin' like Rico
Why you ain’t called me on that?
I serve you out the backdoor
Nigga I serve you out the window
(I serve you out the window)
I serve you out the front door
Nigga I serve you out the car door
Maybach like OGG
200, 000 on auto
Carbon 15 with the button on
Make me put it on auto (spray it)
Free the GOAT, that’s Roscoe
We gon' still be at the top though
‘Member we was on the block though
Hundred rounds and a Glock though
Came a long way from the zips of the mid, it was perfect
Stayed down all my motherfuckin’ life, it was worth it
