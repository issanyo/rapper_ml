Skrrt skrrt skrrt skrrt skrrt, don't hit the pothole (skrrt skrrt)
Pull up on the gang gang with my eyes closed (yeah, gang gang)

Yeah (ayy), yeah
Pull up on a bad bitch, look like my ho (she bad though)
Rubber bands bustin’, call it Skyzone (boing, brrt brrt)
That's the money callin' my phone (brrt, brrt, brrt)
Got the fives and the tens stashed in my home (woo)

Coupes on coupes on coupes, on who gon' drag with us
Nigga we all havin' hoes now, put 'em in the bag with us (hoes)
Gang comin’ through sideways, no embarrassing us (doo-doo-doo)
Traphouse like a fireplace when it’s fired up (hah-hah-hah-hah)

Young nigga put your cups up 'cause we poured up (pour me)

[Verse 2: Marlo]
I be on the coolest shit fuckin' coolest bitches
And I give her dick in her stomach, call it a ruler clip
While my young nigga from the West Side be on that foolish shit
And I got some young niggas from the East Side be on that murder
Some niggas you never heard of
And then I take it all the way to the Nawf
So nigga who you workin'?
We get down, we call that dirt
You playin' with the Migos, nigga we murk
Send a hit on your people, yeah I murked
And the four-five new gang, nigga I earned it, uh
Skrrt skrrt, nigga done grabbed the pot
Kickin' that dope, tryna see if shit real or not
'Cause most these niggas be fake, these niggas be squealing out
And I put up a hundred racks and I got it off the block
And I serve my crackers straight drop
And then Four Fee say he got the drop on an opp
So then he spin the block
I gave him half when them shots popped
Had to make sure we don't hit the pot
Whole cup, we goin' to the top

[Chorus: Quavo]
