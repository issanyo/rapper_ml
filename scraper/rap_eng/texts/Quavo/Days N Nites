[Hook: Moneybagg Yo]
I fucked your bitch, that was last night
I had to get up, go catch a flight
I had to get up, go get some money
I had to count up at least a hundred
They tryna book me in California
I’m like I’m smoking on California
I’m in the bank, smell like marijuana
People like damn, what’s that loud aroma?
Hey, days and nights
Days and nights
Roads and flights, hey
Days and nights
Days and nights
Roads and flights, hey
Days and nights
Days and nights
Roads and flights, hey
Days and nights
Days and nights
Roads and flights, for real

[Verse 1: Moneybagg Yo]
I been on the go, fuck slowing down
Taking care of business, fuck fuckin’ ‘round
Hard to catch up with me, in and out of town
Got your bitch with me, she way out of bounds
Smoking orange herb, call this shit the mound
Walk through TSA smelling like a pound
They was on me heavy, tryna search me down
Plane just departed, I just left the ground
Conversation ‘bout some paper
Smoking kush straight out of paper
Feet kicked up like a player
Like I don’t see none of you haters
Versace, Louis V my glasses
I been on the road smashing
I been getting money in lump sums
Man my lil girl rocking Tom-Tom’s
Far away from where I come from
Kicking doors and catch bombs
Watch take up half my forearm
Tabs and percs, I want both of ‘em
Her and her, I want both of ‘em
Double head, that’s nice
I was turnt last night
Woke up, damn near missed my flight

[Verse 2: Quavo]
Bundles of hundreds
Been on the road for months
I took a bitch off the runway
I made her cook up and roll blunts
Pipe it up, I got the Midas touch
Shoot up the club on the Vicodin
I used to watch the J’s scratch on they arm
Like I just sold ‘em some Niacin
Hop on the plane, I fly Delta
Rolls and shows out in Belgium
Membership in Continental
Fuck your bitch right out a rental
You know I fuck with the narcs
All of my cars autopark
You niggas scared of the dark
None of my gangsters bark (no talkin’)
I put the work in the shop cart
Silencer sound like a dart (pew)
My plane is finna depart
I fly over water with sharks
It need some more water, it’s parched
Trapping is a way of art
Young nigga you got ‘em a smart
And keep a toaster, pop tart
