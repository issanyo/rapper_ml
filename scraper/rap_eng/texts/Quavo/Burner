Money comin' in

Ridin' round with the bags on me
'Bout to serve 'em (serve)
Got all these blue Benjamins
Yeah, I earn 'em (cash)
Yeah, I earn 'em (cash, racks)
That money keep on comin' in and comin' in and comin'
That money keep on comin' in and comin' in and comin'
That money keep on comin' in and comin' in and comin'

That money keep on comin' in and comin' in and comin'
That money keep on comin' in and comin' in and comin'
That money keep on comin' in and comin' in and comin'

[Verse: Quavo]
Money keep comin' in (cash)
Put it in mattress (the matress)
Nutted and piped up (pipe up)
Fuckin' on actress' (some actress)

Like I stay in the dragon house (whoosh)
'Member the bando (bando)
Trappin' that gas out the boarded house (gas)
