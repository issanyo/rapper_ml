[Hook: PeeWee Longway]
Bitch I jumped off the porch flippin' shit, havin' bands
You didn't even know it that a young nigga the man
Bitch jumped off the porch, killin shit, Taliban
You didn't even know it that a young nigga the man
I ain't that type of nigga, she know it
I ain't that type of nigga, he know it
I ain't that type of nigga, she know it


[verse 1: PeeWee Longway]
I ain't that type of nigga, she know it
I'm flippin' them bricks with skippa da flippa, she know it
A young nigga with a bad temper
I trap in Versace young Christopher
Damn look at my aristopher
Telling my young niggas go get it
Longway with choppers, longway John Dillinger
I am the chief of the Seminoles
Wrapping and shipping and working the digital
I am the nextco distributor
I been out here thumbing through Benjamins
I can make it get ridiculous
Watch me drop the ticket
Frank Lucas giving away chickens
I call the shots when he come up missing
Young nigga giving orders
Jumped off the porch, my bitch she getting them cross the water
I'm not the nigga take your order
I just fuck your bitch in florida water
Murder murder, brain law and order
Jumping off the porch, they extorted

[Hook: PeeWee Longway]
Bitch I jumped off the porch flippin' shit, havin' bands
You didn't even know it that a young nigga the man
Bitch jumped off the porch, killin shit, Taliban
You didn't even know it that a young nigga the man
I ain't that type of nigga, she know it
I ain't that type of nigga, he know it
I ain't that type of nigga, she know it


[Verse 2: Quavo]
See your the type of guy, cuffin' hoes and lovin' bitches
I'm the type of nigga, I'm in the trap I'm breaking down midget
All of your hoes wanna fuck me
They can't do nothing but work for me
I got that strong arm like Hercules
At the top floor cooking at the double tree
Call up longway, he come with the K
Been trappin' and cappin' for days
I'm tired of servin' the j's
This bitch been calling my phone, I been stuck up in my ways
Remember when I wanted your number, that was way back in the day
