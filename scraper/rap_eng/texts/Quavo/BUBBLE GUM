[Intro]
Buddah Bless this beat

[Chorus]
Fuck with me and get rich (Rich)
Popped one off, then she fly through the six (Six)
Keep a real nigga and she fuck with the bitch (Bitch)
Six in the mornin' and we still talkin' shit (Shit)
Drink a molly, go some weed (Weed)
Pop bubblegum while she thumb through her weave (Weave)
Pop bubblegum while she thumb through her weave
Pop, pop bubblegum while she thumb through her weave (Weave)

[Verse 1]
Hey, you got it, drop, Ferrari ('Rari)
Hey, you got it, hoes, menagin'
Hey, you got it, woah, your wallet (Woah)
Two Falcon 50s back to back on autopilot (Woah)
Jumped on her phone and put them bands on her
Everywhere we go, we see some fans for her
The plug pulled up on me, wanna convo with us
Had to triumph, finesse or gon' buy 'em
Hey, you got it, trust the process (Process)
Hey, you got it, whip it, hibachi (Hibachi)
Hey, you got it, probably goin' through college (College)
Tryna figure out the best way to feed your wallet (Yeah, yeah)

[Chorus]
Fuck with me and get rich (Rich)
Popped one off then she fly through the six (Six)
Keep a real nigga and she fuck with the bitch (Bitch)
Six in the mornin' and we still talkin' shit (Shit)
Drink a molly, go some weed (Weed)
Pop bubblegum while she thumb through her weave (Weave)
Pop bubblegum while she thumb through her weave (Weave)
Pop bubblegum while she thumb through her weave (Yeah, yeah)

[Verse 2]
Hey, you got it, still got it poppin' (Poppin')
Hey, you got it, freeze on the diamonds (Freeze)
Hey, you got it, probably got somebody (Body)
That won't sacrifice it (No)
That don't satisfy you, yeah, yeah
I let her park the Benz, yeah (Skrrt skrrt)
Drop one off, then go shop with friends, yeah (Shop)
This the type of life we live, yeah (Can't stop)
Million dollar type of M's, yeah, yeah
Put her in the light and watch her eyes glow up (Glow)
Locked in tight, she like the vibe on us (Oh)
When she check the 'Gram watch her likes go up (Woah)
Watch her likes go up (Woah)

[Chorus]
Fuck with me and get rich (Rich)
Popped one off then she fly through the six (Six)
Keep a real nigga and she fuck with the bitch (Bitch)
Six in the mornin' and we still talkin' shit (Shit)
Drink a molly, go some weed (Weed)
Pop bubblegum while she thumb through her weave (Weave)
Pop bubblegum while she thumb through her weave (Weave)
Pop bubblegum while she thumb through her weave (Yeah, yeah)
