[Verse 1: Moneybagg Yo]
Ice my neck, popsicle
With a big old, big old pistol (big strap)
I love my dog, my hitters
They just want a red dot, them my niggas (bop bop)
When I say go (go)
They gon' cook you like some dope on the stove (whip it)
Used to walk to the store (what now Yo?)
Now I get a fee to turn up the show
Cujo the way I'm dogging these bitches
AMBER Alert, the roof gone missing (gone)
Hit the gas, disappear like magician (skrrt)
Then reappear, whip up like a kitchen (whip whip)
Drippin' Ragu, shitted on 'em bathroom (bathroom)
He was on the internet tough
See him out in public, ain't sparin' dude
I'ma make the bag move (how?), U-Haul
Rap niggas got jokes, Lil Duval
New whip, new bitch like Bright
New strap, big clip, no fight (baow)
Nike gang with an iced out mic (mic)
Might OD 'cause my Sprites on spike (whoa)
Stayed down, my career took flight (take off)
Big bag, move the money my height (big bag)

The coupe got drag (drag)
Young nigga pull up with masks (woo)

So I beat up the pot everlasting (beat it)
Fire like dragon (fire)
Walkin' wit nothin' but assassins (woo)
That ain't real gold (gold)
Nigga get sticked to a magnet (magnet)
Wrist like whoa (whoa)
I bought a brand new stove (stove)
Retired the block (block)
No more trapping at the stove (trap)
You can find the knot (knot)
Pick a pocket, all fours (pick one)
Pull up in drops (drops)
Butterfly both doors (skrrt)
Fuck on the cops (fuck)
Bullet fly with the pole (baow baow)
Jump out of a private (woo)
Hit the stage, do a show (PJ)

[Verse 3: Moneybagg Yo]
Ice my wrist, my hand (ugh)
Get your bitch a fan (lil bitch)
Dope came in, it was tan (light brown)
You can get popped like xan (baow)
Speakin' of xan, balls
Just popped two on the flight to Japan (I'm up there)
Overseas bag (what?)
I'm 'bout to fuck up some yen as soon as I land (that's money)
