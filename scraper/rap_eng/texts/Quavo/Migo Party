[Hook: Quavo]
The way I slam dunk the pot
Call me Dominique Wilkins
And you know I keep the white girl
Call it Jessica Simpson
Pull up and
They call a young nigga mardy
I like to welcome you all, welcome you all to the migo party

[Verse 1: Quavo]
Yah Quavo
Welcome to Milan, my niggas be living like talibans
I got kickstand, got molly santan, be running around in Milan
You talking, my niggas will bust you [?] in
My niggas is juugin' finnesin' in every season
God damn, he test the dope now the junkie nose bleedin'
Had to draw down on a fuck nigga the other day cause he thought I was easy
50 gold bottles of the ace of spades looking like they bringing me a deck of cards
God gave me a second chance so young nigga gotta go super hard
Beat the pot like Zab Judah
Mansion party kick it in Bermuda
Callin' up flippa that nigga my shooter
Cut them to pieces then put em' in coolers
Pocket rocket in the club with me
Lil' mama, lil' mama no dancing on me
Got bags in the party no groceries
When you grow up nigga you don't wanna be me
(gone)
Fuck nigga

[Hook: Quavo]
The way I slam dunk the pot
Call me Dominique Wilkins
And you know I keep the white girl

Pull up and

I like to welcome you all, welcome you all to the migo party

[Verse 2: Skippa Da Flippa]
(Flippa)
Migo the party and yes we get narly we don't [?]
Snow bun its like the cocaine in iCarly
Could be the Fisker but I chose the Rari
Brought her a shrimp plate when we ate at Bennies
She get freaky [?] when she sip the Henny
I'm fucking all night if the molly get in
The gangster being in me so I keep a semi
She came to party she bought her own Whiskey
I hit it from the back and then bust on her titties
My diamonds on glacier, my rollies on fleek
Monopoly money [?]
[?] like LeBron I might shoot like I'm Curry
Can you take three shots quick flash in a hurry
[?] but most of em' dirty
[?] you might think I'm [?]

[Hook: Quavo]
The way I slam dunk the pot

And you know I keep the white girl
