[Intro]
Cardo got wings

[Chorus: Quavo]
Ice cold, 'frigerator froze
Bankrolls, cheese nachos
Superbowl, Quavo scooped and scored
Once you get a slice, you gotta get a loaf
Once I get that cake, I just can't let it go
She put it in my face, I'm just gon' let it flow
She say she want that flake, yeah, I give her snow
She gets so hot, she get too high, UFO

[Refrain: Travis Scott]
Oh, I guess, oh, oh, I guess
Ride around and flex, disrespect
Yeah, link with me, light my neck and link with me
Yeah, lean and weed, can't control the lean and weed
So low-key with it, so high-key with it
Like in a stingray, know a nigga be with it, yeah

[Bridge: Quavo]
Quavo, they callin' me Saint Nick
We at the top like the North Pole
Ice cold, 'frigerator froze
Ice cold, 'frigerator froze

[Chorus: Quavo]
Ice cold, 'frigerator froze
Bankrolls, cheese nachos
Superbowl, Quavo scooped and scored
Once you get a slice, you gotta get a loaf
Once I get that cake, I just can't let it go
She put it in my face, I'm just gon' let it flow
She say she want that flake, yeah, I give her snow
She gets so hot, she get too high, UFO

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus: Quavo]
Ice cold, 'frigerator froze
Bankrolls, cheese nachos
Superbowl, Quavo scooped and scored
Once you get a slice, you gotta get a loaf
Once I get that cake, I just can't let it go
She put it in my face, I'm just gon' let it flow
She say she want that flake, yeah, I give her snow
She gets so hot, she get too high, UFO

[Refrain: Travis Scott]
Oh, I guess, oh, oh, I guess
Ride around and flex, disrespect
Yeah, link with me, light my neck and link with me
Yeah, lean and weed, can't control the lean and weed
So low-key with it, so high-key with it
Like in a stingray, know a nigga be with it, yeah
