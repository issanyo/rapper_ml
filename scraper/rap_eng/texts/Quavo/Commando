[Intro: Takeoff]
De—De—De—Deko
They said it was called the trap (OG Parker)
Well, on the north side we call it the bando
Yeen know
Nah, for real

[Chorus: Takeoff]
All my niggas turn to Rambo or commando (grah)
We the first ones that came up with the bando (bando)
Talkin' 'bout you got the Act' but what they goin' for? (Act')
I'm 'bout to start extortin' niggas for that Migo flow (ayy)
We the ones that really came in with the kickin' do' (boom)
Same niggas brought Versace to the centerfold ('Sace)
Take off on the plug, I hit him with the finger roll
If you can buy the car then why the fuck you rent it for? (bitch)
All of my niggas, they ready to get you and hit you and flip you
And never leave no witnesses to see you
And if you thinkin' 'bout calling your mommy, your daddy, your brother, your sister, that chopper hit you, havin' a seizure (ayy)
I been teachin' niggas lingo like I’m a teacher
Mamacita, she lookin' like a picture of Mona Lisa
Fucked 'em up with the dab so we goin' up on the feature
All of my bitches, they piped up and conceited (Take-Take-Take-Takeoff)

[Verse 1: Takeoff]
All rose gold on, call it Rose Bowl (rose)
I got the key, unlockin' the game like a cheat code (cheat)
Fuck a bad bitch, I'm fuckin' with the fleek hoes (fleek)
And I’d never give my soul up for a bankroll (nah)
Niggas get lucky, standin' right there by the rainbow (leprechaun)
No rain though, I'm in the Yung Rich Nation raincoat (rain)
Good aim though, that red dot up at your Kangol (b-b-baow)
Lookin' in my DM and I see your main ho (ayy)
You know we the ones that came up with the bando (you know)
Them boys talkin' 'bout the boards on the windows (bando)
When you trappin', keep a shooter at the front door
Fuck, twelve! Runnin' out the back do' (ayy)
The ring on my pinky is bigger than a globe (woo!)
Skippa Da Flippa done flipped a nigga, never fold (Flippa)
Pipin' up in front of your bitch, you'll get elbowed (baow)
Ping pong, hit a nigga with the ring on (ayy)
Yung Rich Nation jeans on, it's yo' theme song (huh)
So many pints in my crib, it's a lean home (lean)
I'm so high, I just need a wall to lean on
Phone home, get so stoned when we gone (stoned)
Cookie smokin', the ozone, rich snow cone (ice)
Mink, it cost five, I leave the coat on (mink)
Big Tymer, get your roll on (Rollie)
Clap a nigga with the Ric Flair robe on, hold on (hold on)

[Chorus: Takeoff]
All my niggas turn to Rambo or commando (graat)
We the first ones that came up with the bando (bando)
Talking ‘bout you got the Act but what they goin’ for (Act')
I’m bout to start extorting niggas for that Migo flow (ayy)
We the ones that really came in with the kicking doors (boom)
Same niggas brought Versace to the centerfold ('sace)
Take off on the plug, I hit him with the finger roll
If you can buy the car then why the fuck you rent it for (bitch)
All of my niggas they ready to get you and hit you and flip you
And never leave no witnesses to see you
And if you, thinkin’ ‘bout calling your mommy, your daddy, your brother, your sister
That chopper hit you, having a seizure (ayy)
I been teaching niggas lingo like I’m a teacher
Mamacita, she looking like a picture of Mona Lisa
Fucked ‘em up with the dab, so we goin’ up on the feature
All of my bitches they piped up and conceited

[Verse 2: Offset]
Offset!
Semi-automatic out the window of the Caddy (graow)
I know this shit is tragic, toss your bitch up like a salad (smash)
Walk up in the mansion, I just made a money pallet (mansion)
Trappin’ out the bando, selling crack up in the alley (crack)
I send my young niggas, act a fool with the tool (baow)
Contemplating, should I drop a four or drop a deuce?
Heard you a real slick looking for a good lick (lick)
But my niggas ain’t going for the bullshit (naw)
I got the stick, nigga don’t trip (pow)
Nigga run up in your house and tying up your bitch (graat)
Boot up that bitch in the morning on grits (boot)
J’s at the bando in the morning, got to fix (J's)
I’m sitting on the pedestal, my diamonds look impeccable (shine)
Your bitch sucking my dick just like an edible (ugh)
Make her take a physical like medical (physical)
Fucking bitches overseas like it’s America (ayy)
You niggas don’t even know I got some pain in me (pain in me)
Missing my grandma, wish she could sing to me (grandma)
A lot of dirt I did, I got some shame in me (argh)
When I’m pulling up I drop the brain on it (skrr)
Came in the game with the fashion statement (ha)
We dropped Versace, the fame it came quick ('sace)
Got to stay focused, consistent, don’t quit (ayy)
Brick on my wrist and it make me a lick (dab)

[Chorus: Takeoff]
All my niggas turn to Rambo or commando (graat)
We the first ones that came up with the bando (bando)
Talking ‘bout you got the Act but what they goin’ for (Act')
I’m bout to start extorting niggas for that Migo flow (ayy)
We the ones that really came in with the kicking doors (boom)
Same niggas brought Versace to the centerfold ('sace)
Take off on the plug, I hit him with the finger roll
If you can buy the car then why the fuck you rent it for (bitch)
All of my niggas they ready to get you and hit you and flip you
And never leave no witnesses to see you
And if you, thinkin’ ‘bout calling your mommy, your daddy, your brother, your sister
That chopper hit you, having a seizure (ayy)
I been teaching niggas lingo like I’m a teacher
Mamacita, she looking like a picture of Mona Lisa
Fucked ‘em up with the dab, so we goin’ up on the feature
All of my bitches they piped up and conceited

[Verse 3: Quavo]
Quavo
The way they took a nigga’s dab I want to smack a nigga (baow)
Knock a nigga’s lights out, Uncle Wack a nigga (Wack 100)
These niggas made out of plastic like a action figure (plastic)
I can’t kick it with your bitch, I ain’t no Falcon’s kicker (naw)
Young nigga in the hood eating Honey-sicles (ugh)
I’ma send your ho a text with the purple pickle (ho)
Nigga I ain’t gotta flex, I’m a real nigga (naw)
I know niggas in the bando still trapping nickles (uhh)
Pop a perc, you think I’m Marshawn eating Skittles (perky)
Everybody still comparing Migos to the Beatles (everybody)
Who the fuck you think you scaring with that lil nina? (who)
Call my niggas and they pulling up like 'Al-Qeeda' (ayy)
Damn I mean Al-Qaeda, spray ‘em like a firefighter
For fucking with the albino, feeling like Mekhi Phifer
Niggas having ghostwriters, stripes like I’m Tony Tiger
Migo gang the three igniters, then they try to doubt us (ayy)
I know you remember the titans (titans)
You know we got that touch like we work for Midas (Midas)
Like my cookie with the purple in it like the Vikings
Came from a long road, you the one that starts hitchhiking (that's you)
I pour a glass of water ‘cause you wanna pop a Vicodin (water)
I open up the door, she said damn my mans you’re frightening (woah)
Spikes on my shoe, yeah I’m Christian Loub, Mike-ing it (spikes)
Where’s Quavo? bitch I’m in another continent
