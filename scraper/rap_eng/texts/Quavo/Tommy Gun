[Intro: Quavo]
Livin' my life like Osama
Bitches they suckin' and fuckin' for Hondas
Livin my life like Osama
Bitches they suckin' and fuckin' for Hondas
Livin' my life like Osama
Bitches they suckin' and fuckin' for Hondas
Met another plug flew straight to Hong Kong then drop the work off in Tijuana (Hong Kong)

[Chorus: Quavo]
Feelin' like Al Capone with my Tommy Gun (Al Capone)
I’m feelin' like I’m Osama Bin Laden on the run (Osama Bin Laden)
I’m feelin' like I might meet my plug out in Hong Kong (out in Hong Kong)
(Brr brr brrrrr, fuck) Feds done tapped my phone (Fuck 12)
Feelin' like Al Capone with my Tommy Gun (Woo)
I’m feelin' like I’m Osama Bin Laden on the run (Osama Bin Laden)
I’m feelin' like I might meet my plug out in Hong Kong
(Brr brr brrrrr, fuck) Feds done tapped my phone

[Verse 1: Quavo]
Livin' my life like Osama
Bitches they suckin' and fuckin' for Hondas
Met another plug flew straight to Hong Kong then drop the work off in Tijuana (Hong Kong)
This is my life and I do what I wanna I’m trappin' and cappin' on corners
Fuck nigga you settin' up shop in the wrong side of town
I’mma give you a warning
AK-47 karat lingo
Shoot a fuck nigga like a free throw
Finessin' the plug for kilos
(Who that bangin' on the door?)
I don’t even know cause the nigga put his finger on the peephole
I ain't even answer the door
Boom, boom, boom keep bangin' on the door
Bow, bow, bow, gloww, get away from the door (get away)

[Chorus: Quavo]
Feelin' like Al Capone with my Tommy Gun (Al Capone)
I’m feelin' like I’m Osama Bin Laden on the run (Osama Bin Laden)
I’m feelin' like I might meet my plug out in Hong Kong (out in Hong Kong)
(Brr brr brrrrr, fuck) Feds done tapped my phone (Fuck 12)
Feelin' like Al Capone with my Tommy Gun (Woo)
I’m feelin' like I’m Osama Bin Laden on the run (Osama Bin Laden)
I’m feelin' like I might meet my plug out in Hong Kong
(Brr brr brrrrr, fuck) Feds done tapped my phone

[Verse 2: Drum Smith]
Snitch niggas givin' testimonies
Dru smith and I’m flexin' on ‘em
Whip the deuce and get extras from it
I’m a legend homie dat my fleximony
Louis down to my shoe string
Y’all broke niggas too lame
Y’all nigga like set trippin'
Y’all switchin' colors like a moon ring
All the homie da street got em
Choosin' like they got our problem
Told my bitch and she take a brick
She 'bout to steal them all she gon' die abound
Dru Smith got a lot of goon
Penthouse with a lot of room
Snitch nigga, you love singin'
Yo pussy ass need auto tune
I’m Dru Smith and it’s flex season
I’m seein' snow on a block in June
You ain't neva met dang-dang
I swear to God your baby momma knew 'em
I don’t give her my main line
Call solo, give my apology to him
Feelin' just like big worm
More clean than the laundry room!
Flex up

[Chorus: Quavo]
Feelin' like Al Capone with my Tommy Gun (Al Capone)
I’m feelin' like I’m Osama Bin Laden on the run (Osama Bin Laden)
I’m feelin' like I might meet my plug out in Hong Kong (out in Hong Kong)
(Brr brr brrrrr, fuck) Feds done tapped my phone (Fuck 12)
Feelin' like Al Capone with my Tommy Gun (Woo)
I’m feelin' like I’m Osama Bin Laden on the run (Osama Bin Laden)
I’m feelin' like I might meet my plug out in Hong Kong
(Brr brr brrrrr, fuck) Feds done tapped my phone
