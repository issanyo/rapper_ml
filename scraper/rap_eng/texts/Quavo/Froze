[Chorus: HXTXG (Kid Buu)]
Froze, froze, froze, froze yea
Froze, froze, froze, froze
My wrist so froze
My chain so froze
My bitch she so cold
Pinky ring so froze
Froze, froze, froze, froze yea
Froze, froze, froze, froze
My wrist so froze
My chain so froze
My bitch she so cold
Pinky ring so froze

[Verse 1: HXTXG (Kid Buu)]
So froze, so froze VVS got a nigga in a chokehold
All this guala got a young nigga more hoes
All these diamonds got me walking out with your hoe
Sippin' my lean, she on slow mo
Percocet, kick that hoe out she a bozo
We getting guala, y'all broke bo's
Your hoe send me snaps, she got no clothes
Rich nigga ridin' in a Masi, woo
Pull up got bricks behind me, woo
When I start smiling, see diamonds on my teeth
But do not try me, my shooter pull hommies
Silencers all on the tip, hit 'em you won't hear shit
Got snipers broad day on the roof, if Takeoff say shoot boow baow, sniper gon' shoot
We be too froze for these lames, aye
She like my givenchy jeans, aye
Might just skrt off in the lane, aye
She take her skirt off in my lane, aye
Leave with two hoes, leave with your hoe damn, aye
Rollie my wrist, 50 bands
Pinky ring cost me a grand

[Chorus: HXTXG (Kid Buu)]
Froze, froze, froze, froze yea
Froze, froze, froze, froze
My wrist so froze
My chain so froze
My bitch she so cold
Pinky ring so froze
Froze, froze, froze, froze yea
Froze, froze, froze, froze
My wrist so froze
My chain so froze
My bitch she so cold
Pinky ring so froze

[Verse 2: Quavo]
Ice out all on my neck
Ice out all my wrist
Ice out on my fist
I don't want your hoe so I froze that bitch
Ice in my cup I might as well pour me a four
Got ice in that bag, I'm trappin' that meth and snow
Your bitch she like snow, she love to put in her nose
If I pipe up your hoe, it's like putting a oldschool on 24's
Come to my hood but nobody safe if I pull up in Wraith
Humongous got molly that bitch wanna taste it
I don't pass a bag boy I like to face it
I bought a dirt bike to fuck up my acres

[Chorus: HXTXG (Kid Buu)]
Froze, froze, froze, froze yea
Froze, froze, froze, froze
My wrist so froze
My chain so froze
My bitch she so cold
Pinky ring so froze
Froze, froze, froze, froze yea
Froze, froze, froze, froze
My wrist so froze
My chain so froze
My bitch she so cold
Pinky ring so froze
