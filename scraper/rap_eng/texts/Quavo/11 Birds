[Verse 1: Takeoff]
I am a champion, I know the game (champ)
They know the name, we bringin' the pain
Quarterback vision, precision my aim
Run with that sack like a malfunctioned train
I put in work, this is my turf
You thinkin' 'bout takin' it, must be insane
We play when it's sunny, or snow and in rain
Don't matter the weather, we play all the same
They call us champs, 'cause we been champions (champs)
And we been off with a Super Bowl ring (ice)
We know the game like the coaches but play like the OG
That's why we the best in the league
Breakin' pelvis, knockin' off helmets
What happen when you face the winnin' team (winning)
Here come the birds and wings
When we on that field, let's see (see)

[Verse 2: Offset]
Offset!
Yuh, Super Bowl rings
We goin' hard, blitzin' they team
Go 'gainst the odds and we turn to machines
Block out the haters when I run the screen
The fans in the crowd give me cheers when I scream
We got good defense we watching the wing
Running on the sideline, tip-toe lean (sideline)
We up by the halftime, fourth on the three (hey hey)
We got a lock down on defense, uh
Not taking no L the whole season, uh
Throw me a bomb and I'll leave 'em (bomb)
Defeat 'em, we dogs, we eat 'em
Yeah, play like a champ (champ)
Yeah, make every play count (count)
Yeah they counted us out
We got our name out took a route now we out
