[Hook: Quavo]
I copped the coupe, then I blew out the brain, aye
I fuck a hoe, then I don’t know her name, aye
I got some niggas that gon’ ride to the end
Forgive me Lord, I repent all my sins
Hate it or love it we winning again, and again, and again, and again
I copped the coupe, then I blew out the brain, aye
I fuck a hoe, then I don’t know her name, aye
I got some niggas that gon’ ride to the end
Forgive me Lord, I repent all my sins
Hate it or love it we winning again, and again, and again, and again

[Verse 1: Quavo]
I copped the coupe, then I blew out the brain
My rollie bust down – no “Plain Jane,”
I’m fucking on hoes; I don’t know they name
Hate it or love, bitch, we in the game
My niggas walk in and we shoot up your place
Got a halloween mask and a dirty AK
I fuck on her one time; she want me to stay
I’m pitching hardball like I play for the Braves
I call my plug and he give it away
Then nobody touch it, it looking amazing
Hate it or love it, we get to the faces
My pockets so sloppy, ‘bouta make it with gravy
Fuck is you saying?

[Hook]
I copped the coupe, then I blew out the brain, aye
I fuck a hoe, then I don’t know her name, aye
I got some niggas that gon’ ride to the end
Forgive me Lord, I repent all my sins
Hate it or love it we winning again, and again, and again, and again
I copped the coupe, then I blew out the brain, aye
I fuck a hoe, then I don’t know her name, aye
I got some niggas that gon’ ride to the end
Forgive me Lord, I repent all my sins
Hate it or love it we winning again, and again, and again, and again

[Verse 2: Offset]
Hate it or love it, we winning
Put my heart in my music – it’s genuine
Dropping the top off the Benz
We came from the bando community
You know that we started the trend
These niggas copy us, usually
Your bitch want to fuck – she a fan
She got good brain; let her tutor me
This was apart of the plan
Dropping the top in the Lam’
We did this shit for the fam’
These niggas know who I am
Drop the top on the Bentley and it’s over
Hop in the Porsche and pull over
Dropping a four in my soda
I fucked that bitch at the [?]
She piped up, I noticed
I’m having cash and it’s on me
Welcome to the mansion, this a castle
Hop in the pool, it’s deep
Never meet a nigga like me
We had to make it out the streets
I was in a Lam’ on a beach
Hate it or love it, we gonna’ eat

[Hook]
I copped the coupe, then I blew out the brain, aye
I fuck a hoe, then I don’t know her name, aye
I got some niggas that gon’ ride to the end
Forgive me Lord, I repent all my sins
Hate it or love it we winning again, and again, and again, and again
I copped the coupe, then I blew out the brain, aye
I fuck a hoe, then I don’t know her name, aye
I got some niggas that gon’ ride to the end
Forgive me Lord, I repent all my sins
Hate it or love it we winning again, and again, and again, and again

[Verse 3: Takeoff]
Hate it or love it, my nigga thugging
Light up that cookie, smoke out in public
Double cup, a nigga pouring muddy
It get ugly – hate it or love it
Fuck that broke nigga, don’t fuck with the industry
Literally, I don’ been shot at, like 50 Cent
Fuck niggas having them feminine tendencies, really you niggas just envy me
Niggas be sneak dissing, think they offending me
YRN 2, the rich niggas, they feeling me
I can’t stand broke niggas ‘cause they be killing me
Niggas they hate me ‘cause they can’t get rid of me
I copped the coupe, then I blew out the brain
Don’t know what I’m talking ‘bout? I mean mentally
My diamonds come from Elliot Avianne, you get your diamonds from Tiffany
Hate or love it, my niggas we got the top, my nigga, and we turned nun’ to something
You can talk down all you want to, but you cannot stop my God when them blessings be coming
They don’t want to see me make it
Talking ‘bout Karma when I’m out in Tijuana
My niggas, they keep it one hundred
Hate it or love it, my niggas, they get to the money

[Hook]
I copped the coupe, then I blew out the brain, aye
I fuck a hoe, then I don’t know her name, aye
I got some niggas that gon’ ride to the end
Forgive me Lord, I repent all my sins
Hate it or love it we winning again, and again, and again, and again
I copped the coupe, then I blew out the brain, aye
I fuck a hoe, then I don’t know her name, aye
I got some niggas that gon’ ride to the end
Forgive me Lord, I repent all my sins
Hate it or love it we winning again, and again, and again, and again
