[Verse]
Bad bitches on deck
My diamonds get em so wet (water)
My diamonds always so wet (water)
These rappers old they so wack (they wack)
I'm sippin on some hi-tech (mud)
I'm sippin on some hi-tech (that red)
Percocets in Texas next
Percocets in Texas next
I'm getting money like I suppose to
Bagging hoes like they groceries
Monkey hoes can't close to me (naw)
And I keep a woolie close to me
I got hoes thats overseas
I'm on top so they under me
I hit and quit her and i got up outta there
And I had on Versace briefs
Same nigga I ain't change
I'm getting so sick of these lames (lames)
I ain't even got say no names
I'm just gone stay in my lane
I kept it one hunnid with niggas
You won't catch me running from niggas
I'm thumbing through hunnids lil nigga
I tell em keep coming lil nigga
See they gone hate on him they mad
Call a lil bad hoe at Ractrac
All these hoes love my face tats
Go to V live and they gone shake that
I'm so high can't even say shit
Go spend a ten on a bracelet
Got strong in the weed will lace it
I spent your rent on some braces
Alexander on my scarf
Big dawgs on bars
Wide body double park
Ball like I'mma ball player
VS1s I see all the haters
I ain't stuntin I'm just counting paper
Got trap house gotta know the neighbors
We gone send that bitch we gone never save her

[Hook: Quavo]
When I take drugs I go to the moon
Lil' spoiled bitch, 2000 on shoes
Walk in the club with one bitch, leave with two
By myself at the top like cocoon
When I'm in the coupe I feel like a cocoon
Designer gives red bottoms baboon
We the wave, we the wave, typhoon
Take her out of the hills to fuck with some goons
Now she breaking pounds in my room
