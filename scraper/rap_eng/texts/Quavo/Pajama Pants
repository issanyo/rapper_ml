[Pre-Hook – Future]
I’m fresh to death, I need an ambulance
I like a bad Puerto Rican on a handstand
Never talk 'bout what she be wearing off in the club
I’m talking bout what that bitch be wearing off in my room

[Hook – Nick Cannon]
In my room, get it popping in them pajama pants
Get it popping in them pajama pants
In my room, get it popping in them pajama pants
Get it popping in them pajama pants

[Verse 1 – Nick Cannon]
Tell the white girls to pop it, tell the black girls to drop it
Dominicans, Puerto Ricans, do it again, don’t stop it
Don’t want to see you in no skirt
Don’t want to see you in no bra
Got some hoes and some hoes and some hoes in this house
She came in the club with her friends, so now I’m fucking her friends
You know how we go with them hating ass hoes (Yo it’s Nick Cannon and Migos!)
But don’t believe the rumors, fuck college girls and cougars
They creeping in my room tryna cut like Freddy Krueger
Them strippers I salute you, church girls, hallelujah
Even got your grandmamma twerk-twerking out her bloomers
Them strippers I salute you, church girls, hallelujah
Even got your grandmamma twerk-twerking out her bloomers

[Pre-Hook – Future]
I’m fresh to death, I need an ambulance
I like a bad Puerto Rican on a handstand
Never top out when she be wearing off in the club
I’m talking bout what that bitch be wearing off in my room

[Hook – Nick Cannon]
In my room, get it popping in them pajama pants
Get it popping in them pajama pants
In my room, get it popping in them pajama pants
Get it popping in them pajama pants

[Verse 2 – Takeoff]
She pop lock and drop it, and shawty Korean
She twerk it, she roll it, her body like Shakira
Migos, Nick Cannon, we wyling out
Lil mama she bad, she standing out
Trap out the bando, I’m hiding out
She twerking it, making that money for certain
She hit the bedroom and she squirting
[?], lord have mercy
Then I pull up in the Fisker, but never tell her that I miss her

[Verse 3 – Quavo]
She can pop it in pajamas, take her to the Bahamas
She can smoke up all my reefer, she be introduced to my mama
Like a pizza, delivery to the neighbors
And you can catch me with Nick Cannon, wyling out on vacation
We on our way to the top, Migos party at the top floor
And you can’t attend this party ‘less you got on pajamas

[Verse 4 – Traphik]
I say, who got the nicest cakes up in they PJs
Could it be them east coast latino mamis twerking in BK
Or, could it be that LA face, with a but from the bay
Either way, put that cake in my face like it’s my b-day
She know just what she doing when she doing what she does
I take a couple shots up off her booty till I’m buzzed
Cause, I feel that Henny pumping through my blood
Don’t like my bitches skinny, I just like a little budge
So if you got that apple, maybe peach, maybe a plum
My banana’s in pajamas so watch out cause here I come
A movie from Nick Cannon cause I beat it like a drum
Got my hands up on her cakes and then I squeeze em till their crumbs
Wake up in the morning, make a sandwhich and I’m swazy
You cannot have my babys, I’m so sorry, please don’t hate me
She said if I wore my PJs then I thought that you would date me
I said no you had it backwards baby, I was only JP

[Hook – Nick Cannon]
In my room, get it popping in them pajama pants
Get it popping in them pajama pants
In my room, get it popping in them pajama pants
Get it popping in them pajama pants
