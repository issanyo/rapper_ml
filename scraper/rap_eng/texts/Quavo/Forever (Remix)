[Intro: Sebastian Kole]
But this time I want
Forever, forever, forever, yeah

[Pre-Chorus: Sebastian Kole]
Yeah, but this time I want
Forever, forever, forever, yeah
Yeah, but this time we'll last
Forever, forever, forever, yeah

[Chorus: Sebastian Kole & Tinie Tempah]
Promise I will stay
I will never leave you
Forever and a day
That's how long we'll be together, yeah
But this time I want
Forever, forever, forever, yeah
Yo, yo, hey

[Verse 1: Tinie Tempah]
We only get one life
I just wanna get it right
Pop a senzu bean
We ain't never gonna die
And if nothing last forever
Or forever is a lie
What we have is everything in between hello and goodbye
Got so many things in mind, eh
So many places that I wanna go
Got so many artist that I wanna sign
Why the fuck you think we still on our grind
Already told them a billion times
This is for

[Chorus: Sebastian Kole & Yxng Bane]
Forever, forever, forever, yeah
Hey, this is for
Forever more

[Verse 2: Yxng Bane]
You cast a spell
Can't pull my words together
Clever little soul!
Weather the storm
Ride through seasons with me
When'd you turn so cold
Don't loose control
I'm so in control
Forever is tomorrow
Just close your eyes
I'll kiss you slow
Marilyn Monroe

[Verse 3: Sebastian Kole]
I'm not afraid to fail
Maybe I'm scared to fly
Funny how fear of heights
Can push you to gettin' high
Money can't buy you love
But it can get you by
Until they say goodbye, yeah, yeah
I'm so used to wakin' up to someone new
I'm so used to breakin' up, I'm breakin' down
I'm so used to pain it makes me comfortable
Learned to hide my sabotage in camouflage, no

[Pre-Chorus: Sebastian Kole]
Yeah, but this time I want
Forever, forever, forever, yeah
Yeah, but this time we'll last
Forever, forever, forever, yeah

[Chorus: Sebastian Kole & Quavo]
Promise I will stay
I will never leave you
Forever and a day
That's how long we'll be together, yeah
But this time I want
Forever, forever, forever, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, Quavo

[Verse 4: Quavo]
This time, this time, this time, this time
I want it forever (yeah)
This is my time, my time
We cannot settle (woo)
For no nicks and dimes (no)
We wanna live better (better)
Take it to another level (yeah)
Young nigga, trendsetters (ayy)

But a young nigga still real clever (clever)

[Chorus: Sebastian Kole]
Forever, forever, forever, yeah

We've got it, oh boy
Forever, forever, forever, yeah
