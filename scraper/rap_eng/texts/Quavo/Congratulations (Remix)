[Intro: Future]
Worked so hard, forgot to vacation, yeah
They ain't never had the dedication, yeah
People said we changed and look, we made it
Metro Boomin want some more nigga

[Chorus: Post Malone]
My momma called, seen you on TV, son
Said shit done changed ever since we was on
I dreamed it all ever since I was young
They said I wouldn't be nothin'
Now they always say, "congratulations" (uh)
Worked so hard, forgot how to vacation (uh-huh)
They ain't never had the dedication (uh)
People hatin', say we changed and look, we made it (uh)
Yeah, we made it (uh)

[Verse 1: Future]
We been jumpin' out a foreign, yeah
Hoppin' in somethin' foreign, yeah
They was comin', laughin'
Now we number one in Paris, yeah (number one, number one)
Wake up every mornin' and I can touch the sky
I know they gon' hate, but they don't know 'bout who we are
I catch a body on anything
Came from the bottom, they envy me
I'm drippin' sauce tremendously
Promise, never give 'em sympathy
I told my momma the money comin' fast, fast, fast
In this industry
The ones who used to envy me
I'm turnin' up on 'em instantly, yeah

[Chorus: Future, Post Malone & Both]
My momma called, seen you on TV, son
Said shit done changed ever since we was young
I dreamed it all for my city
Puttin' on, they say I will always sell drugs
But now they say, "congratulations"
Worked so hard, forgot how to vacation (uh-huh)
They ain't never had the dedication (uh)
People hatin', say we changed and look, we made it (uh)
Yeah, we made it (uh)

[Verse 2: Post Malone]
They was never friendly, yeah
Now I'm jumpin' out the Bentley, yeah
And I know I sound dramatic, yeah
But I know I had to have it, yeah
For the money, I'm a savage, yeah
I be itchin' like a addict, yeah
I'm surrounded, twenty bad bitches, yuh
But they didn't know me last year, yuh
Everyone wanna act like they important (yeah)
But all that mean nothin' when I saw my dough, yuh (yeah)
Everyone countin' on me, dropped the ball, yuh (yeah)
Everything custom like I'm at the border, yah, yah
If you fuck with winnin', put your lighters to the sky
How could I make sense when I got millions on my mind?
Comin' with that bullshit, I just put it to the side
Ballin' since a baby, they could see it in my eyes

[Chorus: Post Malone & Quavo]
My momma called, seen you on TV, son
Said shit done changed ever since we was on
I dreamed it all ever since I was young
They said I wouldn't be nothing
Now they always say, "congratulations" (congratulations)
Worked so hard, forgot how to vacation (ooh)
They ain't never had the dedication
People hatin', say we changed and look we made it (uh)
Yeah, we made it (uh, yah)

[Verse 3: Quavo]
I was patient (yah, uh)
I was patient (ayy, uh)
Now I can scream that we made it (we made it!)
Now everyone, everywhere I go, they say, "congratulations" (uh)
Young nigga, young nigga, graduation (yah)
I pick up the rock and I ball, baby (ball)
I'm looking for someone to call, baby (brr)
But right now, I got a situation (ayy)
Never old Ben-Ben Franklins (cashes)
Big rings—ooh—, champagne (champagne)
My life is like a ball game (ball game)
But instead, I'm in the trap though (trap though)

[Chorus: Post Malone, Future & Quavo]

They said I wouldn't be nothin'
Now they always say, "congratulations" (uh)
Worked so hard, I need my medication (uh-huh, ooh)
