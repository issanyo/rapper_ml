[Chorus: Jeremih & Takeoff]
Tonight I decided I don't give no fucks
Don't give a fuck give no fuck
Tonight I decided I don't give no fucks
Don't give a fuck give no fuck
Why the fuck my new engine up in the trunk?
SKRRRRT, in the trunk
Tonight I decided I don't give no fucks
Don't give a fuck, nah give no fuck
Every single night I bet she down to suck
Met another, 'nother bitch, she down to fuck
Red bone, head the color Tonka truck
Wake up in the morning, up like Donald Trump
Room 22 hit the 69
Started off the 'Tron, I'm off the Henny now
Bitch come through, she know the dealy now
You know where I'm from we get to drillin' now
Side bitch, she tried to tie me up
Got no feelin' now, pop a pilly now
Sell out live shows, Colliseum now
Come and see 'em now
Your main bitch is in my DM now
Talkin' 'bout their problems
Drama, that's TMI

[Verse 1: Quavo]
Catch me ridin' in a two-seater
I don't ever go without the nina
Doin' everything illegal
Cause I don't give a fuck about these people
Benjamin, yes he a friend of mine
Two girls, they kiss at the same time
All a nigga see is dollar signs
Bird, they sound like Ty Dolla $ign (BRRR)
I came from the bottom and now I got guala
I woke up this mornin', lipstick on my collar
Play with the water like PBJ Otter
I JK yo' shit like a nigga play soccer
Kick it, look at you niggas, imposters
Look at you, actors, you deserve an Oscar
I'm dabbin', look at my posture!
Takin' your hoe and I fuck her, don't call her
You know I don't give a fuck (don't give a fuck!)
You know I don't give a fuck (don't give a fuck!)
I am not wifin' these hoes
You know it could never be you and us
I came from whippin' them babies
And now they callin' us the greatest
Catch me ridin' in the latest
Piped up, not faded

[Chorus: Jeremih & Takeoff]
Tonight I decided I don't give no fucks
(Don't give a fuck) give no fuck
Tonight I decided I don't give no fucks
(Don't give a fuck) give no fuck
Why the fuck my new engine up in the trunk?
SKRRRRT, in the trunk
Tonight I decided I don't give no fucks
(Don't give a fuck, nah) give no fuck
Every single night I bet she down to suck
Met another, 'nother bitch, she down to fuck
Red bone, head the color Tonka truck
Wake up in the morning, up like Donald Trump
Room 22 hit the 69
Started off the 'Tron, I'm off the Henny now
Bitch come through, she know the dealy now
You know where I'm from we get to drillin' now
Side bitch, she tried to tie me up
Got no feelin' now, pop a pilly now
Sell out live shows, Colliseum now
Come and see 'em now
Your main bitch is in my DM now
Talkin' 'bout their problems
Drama, that's TMI

[Verse 2: Takeoff]
'Til they free Offset I do not give a fuck
Niggas talkin' slick, get hit with the uppercut
I'm not awake then the lil' cousin woke me up
Hop out the bed and then I grab my double cup
They hate on us so you know they don't fuck with us
Can't do nothin' when niggas gon' tell on us
Out in London, niggas can't get into the lobby
Runnin' with a bitch with a bubble butt
I'ma break it down again and I'ma speed it up
Monopoly, the way I run it up
I'm whippin' it and lookin' for the fomula
Ain't nothin' but your bitch lookin' at me, she wanna give it up
They take it like I'ma dab, but you niggas lack
Wanted to laugh, nigga I'm still sippin' Act
Hundred grand in my wallet, backpack
And we got to get more locked than Buscemi straps
Thinkin' 'bout coppin' Aventador
Movin' out to Singapore
Cause these bitches is getting boring
And niggas leavin' me no choice
The difference between me and you and gettin' it
See I wanted to when you was four
And this rap game, it get heated sometime
But I thank the Lord cause I'm not where I was

[Bridge: Jeremih & Takeoff]
Side bitch, she tried to tie me up
Pipe it up, pipe it up, p-p-p-pipe it up
Wake up in the morning, up like Donald Trump
Side bitch, she tried to tie me up
Pipe it up, pipe it up, p-p-p-pipe it up
Wake up in the morning, up like Donald Trump

[Chorus: Jeremih & Takeoff]
Tonight I decided I don't give no fucks
(Don't give a fuck) give no fuck
Tonight I decided I don't give no fucks
(Don't give a fuck) give no fuck
Why the fuck my new engine up in the trunk?
SKRRRRT, in the trunk
Tonight I decided I don't give no fucks
(Don't give a fuck, nah) give no fuck
Every single night I bet she down to suck
Met another, 'nother bitch, she down to fuck
Red bone, head the color Tonka truck
Wake up in the morning, up like Donald Trump
Room 22 hit the 69
Started off the 'Tron, I'm off the Henny now
Bitch come through, she know the dealy now
You know where I'm from we get to drillin' now
Side bitch, she tried to tie me up
Got no feelin' now, pop a pilly now
Sell out live shows, Colliseum now
Come and see 'em now
Your main bitch is in my DM now
Talkin' 'bout their problems
Drama, that's TMI
