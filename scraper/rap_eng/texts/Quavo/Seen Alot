[Intro: Gucci Mane]

[Hook: Quavo]
I done seen a lot of money with my eyes
I done touched a lot of money with my hands
I done seen a lot of money with my eyes
I done touched a lot of money with my hands
I've seen a lot
I've seen a lot
I've seen a lot
I've seen it
I did a lot
I did a lot
I did a lot
I did it
I've seen a lot
I've seen a lot
I've seen a lot
I've seen it
I did a lot
I did a lot
I did a lot
I did it

[Verse 1: Quavo]
I've seen a lot (I've seen a lot)
I did a lot (I did it)
Bitches in the kitchen cookin' broke the whole pot
The block is hot
I know you're not
I got them blocks
No Yung Joc
Just look at my hands, I got them bands
24 hoes stuffed in that caravan
I'm drinkin' on lean, she poppin' a Xan
Went to the jeweler, diamonds kick like Jackie Chan
I've seen it
Without no money ain't breathing
Drop the top in the season
Open up fire he bleedin'
Young Rich Nigga point fingers
Love to walk around with bangers (Kla!)
Extendo with the scope on it, long ranger

[Hook]
I done seen a lot of money with my eyes
I done touched a lot of money with my hands
I done seen a lot of money with my eyes
I done touched a lot of money with my hands
I've seen a lot
I've seen a lot
I've seen a lot
I've seen it
I did a lot
I did a lot
I did a lot
I did it
I've seen a lot
I've seen a lot
I've seen a lot
I've seen it
I did a lot
I did a lot
I did a lot
I did it

[Verse 2: Young Scooter]
I got green eyes, dollar signs in 'em
I got mob ties, still a young nigga
We some wise guys
You a fuck nigga
I'm really from the streets
I know what's up with ya
You ain't never seen a bail out
You ain't touched a brick
Had to stay down with my hustle now I'm filthy rich
This that chicken talk dog, old Gucci shit
Caught him with a hundred bricks
You a fuckin' snitch
He ask me what that multi is
He never seen it
This nigga just another lick I can feel it
That cocaina flow, I done killed it
You fake robbers want to trap, mind your business

[Hook]
I done seen a lot of money with my eyes
I done touched a lot of money with my hands
I done seen a lot of money with my eyes
I done touched a lot of money with my hands
I've seen a lot
I've seen a lot
I've seen a lot
I've seen it
I did a lot
I did a lot
I did a lot
I did it
I've seen a lot
I've seen a lot
I've seen a lot
I've seen it
I did a lot
I did a lot
I did a lot
I did it
