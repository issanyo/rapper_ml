[Verse 1: Johnny Cinco]
I know they after me, can’t let 'em capture me
Lower my faculties, lie like an athlete
I know she after me, can’t let her capture me
She want to dress elite, call me your majesty
Sorry to inform you that I get it in
SakReligious nigga, Y-R-N
Get to the money, don’t care how it's spent
Trust in myself, ain’t no one to depend
Everywhere I go they welcome us in
These bitches drop to their knees and begin
John Popi goin', in him we depend
Pray the good Lord forgive all of my sins
All of my sins, free all of my sins
Free all of my kin, they won’t let them out
Led her straight in cause they know what we 'bout
Trap out the mansion, don’t know the amount
They told me you got to make that shit count
Police told me you got to make that shit count
Get to the money, make every cent count
Make every cent count
Leaving on the road now, she don’t want to go now
She gon' fuck the bro, fuck the sofa
The road, wasn't scared, better know now
I bet she know now, I bet she know now
I been on the road, doing shows, getting to the dough
Ask her to show what she really know
You can't talk about it, you don’t really know
I done sold shit, I don’t really know
I never tell it but I really know

[Verse 2: Quavo]
What you know now? get hit with 100 rounds
What you didn’t know, that I re-up on 100 pounds
What you didn’t know
Migos, Cinco got 100 M's stashed in the floor
What you didn’t know
Might pull up with a chopper and a 44 bulldog
You feeling froggy, nigga leap
My niggas know that you was fraud
You don’t know the half
I came from kicking doors and juuging the slab
You don’t know the half
I dropped out of school, I couldn't finish math
Now that I’m up, 100 thousand put it on a rich nigga's tab

[Verse 3: Johnny Cinco]
I know they after me, can’t let 'em capture me
