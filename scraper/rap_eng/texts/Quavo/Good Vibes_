Verse 1: [Quavo]
I feel in love with a chicks I thought her how to be freaky
That pussy ain't drowning me I get of that leg like a Jeep
I eat that ain't have no fees, but she's lonely
As she hit my phone every morning
Yah I'm pullin up right to her side but I still pull up on her though suicide. And her momma love me but am I idol in his eyes. Told ya imma kill for ya. I told ya imma drive
