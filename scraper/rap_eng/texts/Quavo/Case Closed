[Intro: Quavo]
Zaytoven
Aye, Migos
We back, bitch, yeah
Check it
Y'all probably thought this shit was gon' stop, huh?

[Hook: Quavo]
I bet you thought you would never see (never!)
Migo gang back again, it's the three
You better go hide where your momma be (momma!)
And she told you you can't have no company (no!)
Minor setback for a major comeback
Minor setback for a major comeback
Minor setback for a major comeback
Minor setback for a major comeback
You thought a nigga was gon' fall off (fall off!)
Hahaha, hell no!
Hit em wit, pipe it up, look at my dab
They done fucked up and freed all of my dawgs
Minor setback for a major comeback
Minor setback for a major comeback
Minor setback for a major comeback
Minor setback for a major comeback

[Verse 1: Quavo]
Quavo
Case closed, we can stop the duckin'
Went and did the show out there in Georgia Southern
Had a couple grams on us, large amounts of cash
Couple straps, they wasn't even dirty
We was super late, but they said be early
The other van had Rich and Murk in
Got to the show, 12 deeper than 30
That's when I knew that somebody was workin'
We the only niggas in the back
I had to hand big 12 my fuckin' strap
What I'ma do with my pack?
Damn, I put that shit right in my bag
12 lookin' at us, mad
Cause we thuggin' and our pants sag
While we're pipin' the stage up, doin' the dab dance
12 searchin' the van, damn
They locked up my driver, damn
Soon as we thanked our fans
We walked off the staged
Then walked through the locker room, they was cuffin' our hands
Hold up, ain't no talkin', no discussion
They threw us in the paddy van (paddy!)
Shit, we all said, "Fuck it"
Whatever happen's God's plans

[Hook: Quavo]
I bet you thought you would never see (never!)
Migo gang back again, it's the three
You better go hide where your momma be (momma!)
And she told you you can't have no company (no!)
Minor setback for a major comeback
Minor setback for a major comeback
Minor setback for a major comeback
Minor setback for a major comeback
You thought a nigga was gon' fall off (fall off!)
Hahaha, hell no!
Hit em wit, pipe it up, look at my dab
They done fucked up and freed all of my dawgs
Minor setback for a major comeback
Minor setback for a major comeback
Minor setback for a major comeback
Minor setback for a major comeback

[Verse 2: Offset]
Offset!
I had to sit down once again in the pen
Denyin' my bond once again and again
We kept it solid, don't fold and don't bend
Had to beat a nigga tryna steal up out my Benz
My diamonds be kickin' like Ryu and Ken
If I had the chance I would jump the fence
Sat on my box, read a book while I vent
Didn't do a show, but I still got my percent (cash!)
Felt like I lost it, but I got it back
She archin' her back in the back of my hatch
I swear to the Lord that I'm not goin' back
Back on the road, 80 thou', we need that
Takeoff gave a hunnit, told me to relax
Sleepin' one eye open, Silver without a patch (I see you!)
They set us up knowin' we stay with them straps
You not a boss cause it's somethin' you lack
Minor setback for a major comeback
Smokin' on gas, breathin' like Toni Brax
Back to the bando and back to the trap
Face in my Backwood, I'm not tryna match
Got on my knees and asked God to help me
Actin' like I don't know you like I got amnesia
Portraits in my mansion of Mona Lisa
My partners beggin' me just like they Felicia

[Hook: Quavo]
I bet you thought you would never see (never!)
Migo gang back again, it's the three
You better go hide where your momma be (momma!)
And she told you you can't have no company (no!)
Minor setback for a major comeback
Minor setback for a major comeback
Minor setback for a major comeback
Minor setback for a major comeback
You thought a nigga was gon' fall off (fall off!)
Hahaha, hell no!
Hit em wit, pipe it up, look at my dab
They done fucked up and freed all of my dawgs
Minor setback for a major comeback
Minor setback for a major comeback
Minor setback for a major comeback
Minor setback for a major comeback

[Verse 3: Takeoff]
Muddy trouble on the way to Georgia Southern
Poured me a four and went out of it
Tried to hit a nigga in the head with so many charges
Should've caught a concussion
When I got to the show I woke up, didn't know nothin'
All I seen was police, sheriff, and drug enforcers
Took that, zipped up my hoodie then I got the TEC
And I asked for the Ozium cause it was musty (spray!)
But it's too late for all that cause they lookin'
Now it's 'bout time to walk into the buildin'
My gat's in my britches, I keep smellin' cookies
No this ain't a wrap, but I smell what they cookin'
When I was on stage, I didn't have a feelin'
That they was behind me plottin', tryna get me
If I knew then what a nigga had seen
Promise we would not be in this predicament
Had a zip in my net when I got jammed
Went to the toilet, threw and flushed it down
Lookin' cause it wasn't no cameras around
Autistic when they come to question on sound
Not talkin' so whatever you know, you found
But you ain't find shit, nigga, I'm not a clown
Searchin' so hard, left some drank in the ground
Fuck all that shit, my nigga's out the slam
Nah forreal, Takeoff!

[Hook: Quavo]
I bet you thought you would never see (never!)
Migo gang back again, it's the three
You better go hide where your momma be (momma!)
And she told you you can't have no company (no!)
Minor setback for a major comeback
Minor setback for a major comeback
Minor setback for a major comeback
Minor setback for a major comeback
You thought a nigga was gon' fall off (fall off!)
Hahaha, hell no!
Hit em wit, pipe it up, look at my dab
They done fucked up and freed all of my dawgs
Minor setback for a major comeback
Minor setback for a major comeback
Minor setback for a major comeback
Minor setback for a major comeback
