[Intro]
That boy Cass
Migo got the blue (got the blue)
Trap house jumpin', yeah, the trap house jumpin'
Got the trap jumpin' like kangaroo (trap house jumpin')

[Chorus]
Kangaroo
Trap house jumpin', yeah, the trap house jumpin' (trap)
Kangaroo
Trap house jumpin', yeah, the trap house jumpin'
Ooh, kangaroo
Trap house jumpin', yeah, the trap house jumpin' (trap)
Ooh, kangaroo
Jumpin', jumpin', jumpin'
Trap house jumpin' (go, kangaroo!)

[Verse]
Trap so hot, when you pull up
Gotta tie your shoes in a double knot (tie your shoes, tie 'em)
Trap so hot, gotta go an' stash your dope
'Cause you don't know if they're gonna come or not (dope, dope)
When I say kangaroo
Got big-boy hundos stashed in a Louie pot (hundo)
No longer got dope in my sock
I got the dope in my crotch (ugh)
I pity the fool if you try me
'Cause I'm walkin' 'round lookin' like I'm Mr. T
'Cause I'm lookin' like an athlete
Is it 'cause the bando jumpin' like a trampoline? (bando)
I was broke-anese on my knees (damn)
My ma said, "Go get that payola, please" (momma)
I looked in my momma eyes an' I realised (realised)
I had to chase millions

[Chorus]
Kangaroo (kangaroo)
Trap house jumpin', yeah, the trap house jumpin' (trap)
Kangaroo (kangaroo)
Trap house jumpin', yeah, the trap house jumpin'
Ooh, kangaroo (kangaroo)
Trap house jumpin', yeah, the trap house jumpin' (trap)
Ooh, kangaroo (kangaroo)
Jumpin', jumpin', jumpin'
Trap house jumpin' (go, kangaroo!)
