[Intro: Kacey Khaliel]
Khaliel
Woo!

[Pre-Chorus: Quavo, Chris Brown & Both]
Young nigga on the corner, high on marijuana
Made a promise to his Momma, he would never be a stoner (yeah)
Made a promise to the hood, he ain't never be a loner (oh yeah, ayy)
Came from hand washing Bentleys, now a nigga is a owner (skrrt)
Life got rough, had to keep the Nina on him
Then he met the hand cuffs, 'cause the homie told on him (damn)
Life gave him lemons, and he made cream soda

[Verse 1: Kid Red]
Ma, them niggas be hustlin', we really countin' that cash
A young niggas complainin', they broke and they lookin' bad
Bust down with my niggas, learnt that from my dad
Love all my niggas, bought the boy a new Jag' (skrrt)
If I was you, I would hate too
All this fake love, I'd replace you (fuck you)
Get your bands up, they wanna date you
Tryna fuck your mask off, girl, wanna face you (yeah)
Keep it a hunnid, with all of my soldiers
Car shoppin' with moms, I'ma buy her a Rover
Relies with her Kid, with the world, now I'm colder
Then bought all the mud all I need is the soda

[Chorus: Quavo & Chris Brown]
One hunnid, one hunnid, one hunnid (hey)
I'ma keep it one hunnid, one hunnid (hey)
I'ma keep it one hunnid, one hunnid, one hunnid, one hunnid (hey)
I'ma keep it one hunnid, one hunnid (hey)
I'ma keep it one hunnid with all of my soldiers (hey)

[Verse 2: Takeoff & Chris Brown]
(Woo! Hey!)
Just a nigga on the corner
Geeked up off marijuana (gas)
Made a promise to my momma, I'd never do Coca-Cola (nah) (hey)
When I hit that blunt, bet you promise that I'd never be sober (heh)
Had a dream like Dr. King, Rovers and loaders for the soldiers (hey)
Picture perfect (picture), I'm paintin' perfect pictures
I know niggas that be hustlin', they do it with precision (hey)
Bitches sadity and pretty, knew she got some good intentions (hey)
Prayin' to the ceilin', hope the Lord hear me (listen)
You gotta keep it one hunnid, like the emoji
Gotta stay focused (ah), know niggas that's winnin' trophies
Know niggas sittin' on they sofas (ayy)
Bitches quick to put a spell on 'em, they get like hocus pocus
Drive me crazy, like a dready
Ma said, "Don't eat that spaghetti" (momma)
You can't cuff a bitch, save a hoe, that's what I was told (ooh)
I got two hoes in my tepee like a Navajo (woah)
Bentley Mulsanne, bought all Bentleys in all gold (woah)
I throw that shit away, I had to shoot a photo show (fuck it)
And nah, I ain't lyin', nigga (nah), they think this shit was easy
They didn't see the grind, nigga (grind)
So many fake diamonds, I might as well shine, nigga (shine)
I mean no home, but I just came to take what's mine, nigga
Niggas wanna ride witcha, ain't gon' do no time witcha

[Pre-Chorus: Quavo, Chris Brown & Both]
Young nigga on the corner, high on marijuana

Made a promise to the hood, he ain't never be a loner (oh yeah, ayy)

Life got rough, had to keep the Nina on him
Then he met the hand cuffs, 'cause the homie told on him (damn)
Life gave him lemons, and he made cream soda (yeah)
He kept it one hunnid with all of his solders

[Chorus: Quavo, Chris Brown & Both]
One hunnid, keep it one hunnid with all of my soldiers (yeah)
One hunnid, keep it one hunnid with all of my soldiers (yeah, yeah, ayy, yeah)
One hunnid, keep it one hunnid with all of my soldiers (whoop! Ayy)
One hunnid, keep it one hunnid with all of my soldiers (baby girl, you gotta keep it one hunnid)

[Verse 3: Chris Brown]
Look, I guess they label me a thug nigga
Gang bangin', hangin' with drug dealers
Pour an eight up in the 20 ounce, on that mud, nigga (hey)
Remember paintin' pictures on my wall in the cell
Wish I could thank everybody, that wrote a nigga mail (hey)
Keep it a hunnid with my day ones
And all them bitches with them fake ones, gon' and shake some' (hey)
I still remember them bullets when we hop in them gates (hey)
Ain't niggas run up in my crib, but couldn't crack a safe
Keep it one hunnid, I know them niggas disappointed
Them bitches horny, I know these diamonds make 'em want it
That pussy wet now, 'cause I'm throwin' all the hunnids
Not throwin' shade, hoe, I'm just keepin' it one hunnid

[Bridge: Chris Brown]
Put your hands up in the air now, if you came up from nothing
Keep it one hunnid, all my niggas five hunnid
Sipping codeine, smoking OG, that's that California love
It ain't right, but it ain't wrong, ride or die, I keep it one hunnid

[Pre-Chorus: Quavo, Chris Brown & Both]
