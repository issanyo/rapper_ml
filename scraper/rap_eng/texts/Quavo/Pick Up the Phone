[Bridge: MIKExANGEL]
You know that you got the juice
You know that you got it squeezy
Ridin' around in the coupe
We drop the top when it's breezy

We roll it up for no reason
Swear that pussy is the truth
Swear that pussy is the cleanest

[Verse 2: Fabolous]
No it's annoyin' you

Let your man do what that boy won't do, yeah
Lemme treat you like a princess

Hope I ain't makin' you nervous me
I was hopin' you could swerve on me
Gotta check for the curves on you on me
Every day's like the first to me
That's what's certain, yes, certainly
Swear these niggas wanna murder me
Kill the pussy, that's a purge to me
Be my baby, this a nursery

She say that she was the first with me
She just makin' matters worse for me
