[Verse 1: Sean Kingston]
Girl, I'm the type
See what I want, take it right down
Up every night
Roll in you deep if you let me
Yeah, all up inside
Coupe in the roof, yeah, the mind gone
We geekin' tonight
You front for them but, girl, I know

[Pre-Chorus: Sean Kingston]
Rolling, rolling, dopin' out my mind (ohh)
Drinking, hope I don't black out tonight (no, no)
She don't wanna get me, oh, why not? (hold on)
Tell me now, how can I make you mine? (na, na, na)

[Chorus: Sean Kingston]
Real niggas all around me
That's all I got
Little Hennessy and Vodka
That's all I got
Can you drop it down for me?
That's all I got
'Round and 'round, now let me see
That's all I got
Bad hoes, yeah, they poppin'
That's all I got
Mo' money, mo' problems
That's all I got
Can you drop it down for me?
That's all I got
'Round and 'round, now let me see
That's all I got

[Verse 2: Quavo]
Baby girl, can I ask you
Somebody said you look like Kardashian
Baby girl, can I ask you
Have you ever seen your nigga trapping?
No, no, no, not at all
Surrounded by bad bitches and my dogs
Itching my palms, pocket leapfrog
This all I got so you better ball
She pop ‘em, Percocet
Super soak ‘em, soaking wet
Shot caller, honcho
You brought her, big rolls
Nachos, Pablo
CoCo, on hunnos
And I took your favorite red model
On a field trip to the bando

[Chorus: Sean Kingston]
Real niggas all around me
That's all I got
Little Hennessy and Vodka
That's all I got
Can you drop it down for me?
That's all I got
'Round and 'round, now let me see
That's all I got
Bad hoes, yeah, they poppin'
That's all I got
Mo' money, mo' problems
That's all I got
Can you drop it down for me?
That's all I got
'Round and 'round, now let me see
That's all I got

[Post-Chorus]
Ohh-woah-ohh
That's all I got
Ohh-woah-ohh
That's all I got
Can you drop it down for me?
That's all I got
'Round and 'round, now let me see
That's all I got

[Outro]
We geekin' tonight
We geekin' tonight
We geekin' tonight
Oh, yeah yeah yeah
