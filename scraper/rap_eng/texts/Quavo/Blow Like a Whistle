[Intro: Quavo]
Damn, this is a Mike Almighty production
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Ayy, Huncho, Lingo, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah yeah
Yeah yeah
Yeah

[Chorus: YRN Lingo]
Stick in the back and you know it's gonna split you
That's your girl right there, aight bet, I'm finna hit her
You saying that ain't fair, we don't care, finna dismiss 'em
If it ain't about money, I'm gonna dismiss you
Mind your damn business, if you don't won't no problem nigga
I want the money, fuck the fame, I see the bigger picture
Greedy, jealousness, money change people, that is the issue
But if you change on me, Glock nine gonna blow like a whistle
Woo-woo-woo-woo-woo, blow like a whistle
Woo-woo-woo-woo-woo, Glock nine bullet hit you, hit you
You not smart nor hard, taking pictures with that pistol
My squad been too ready to eat 'em up, let me grab my utensils

[Verse 1: YRN Lingo]
Diamonds over here got me sneezing
Let me grab the hundred for the tissue
Get the money what's the issue, nigga talking crazy gotta handle it
I thought you weren't here for that, young nigga listen up
These niggas faking, perpetrating, hating because they can't make what you making so add it up
If they don't respect it, gotta get hectic
On these folks, you know that you gotta go turn it up
Got the chopper on me and it's burning like it's Usher in the trunk
Muzzle hot, heating it up
Got your girl in the back beating it up
One thing about me I don't give a fuck
Walking around with the Glock
They never gonna find it because Lingo keeping it tucked
Never showed that I'm weak always keeping it tough

[Chorus: YRN Lingo & Quavo]
Woo-woo-woo-woo-woo, blow like a whistle
Woo-woo-woo-woo-woo, Glock nine bullet hit you
Woo-woo-woo-woo-woo, leaving no witness
Woo-woo-woo-woo-woo, handle my business

[Verse 2: Quavo]
Blow like a whistle
Shooting out the Jag with the missile
Your bitch gon' fuck, young nigga don't even kiss her
Break down M's, step on the work no Timbs (step up, work)
Jump out the gym, lifestyle play like the Sims
Pull up on Lingo, break it down, break it down reload
Stand at the line like a free throw
Hit a pot with my left elbow
Inside of the cup like Jello
Seventeen five, Shawty L-O (RIP)
Your bitch wanna stroke my cello
White coupe, skrt, marshmallow
Fuck with my nephew nigga, all it's gon' take is a whistle
Back of the milk carton missing, we ain't going for the sneak dissing

[Chorus: YRN Lingo]
Woo-woo-woo-woo-woo, Glock nine bullet hit you
Woo-woo-woo-woo-woo, blow like a whistle, bye
Mind your damn business, if you don't won't no problem nigga
I want the money, fuck the fame, I see the bigger picture
Greedy, jealousness, money change people, that is the issue
But if you change on me, Glock nine gonna blow like a whistle
Woo-woo-woo-woo-woo, blow like a whistle
Woo-woo-woo-woo-woo, Glock nine bullet hit you, hit you
You not smart nor hard, taking pictures with that pistol
My squad been too ready to eat 'em up, let me grab my utensils
