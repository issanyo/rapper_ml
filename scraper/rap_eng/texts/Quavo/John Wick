[Intro: Quavo]
I don't need no shooter, nigga (ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!)
One gunman (a-ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!)
I just dress in all black with my gun, man (woo!)
Like John Wick (uh!)

[Chorus: Quavo]
All black, one gunman
John Wick, that's a bad man
All black, one gunman
John Wick (baow!)
All black, one gunman (black!)
John Wick (John Wick!) (uh!)
A—a—all black, one gunman
John Wick (woo-oop!)
All black, one gunman
John Wick, gunman (ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!)
All black, one gunman
John Wick, one gunman (a-ha ha ha ha ha!)
All black, one gunman
John Wick, baow, man (woo!)
All black, one gunman
John Wick (John Wick!) (go!)

[Verse 1: Quavo]
One man (one man!), Huncho (Huncho!)
Truck load (truck load!), ammo (ammo!)
All black, suit and tie
Don't move in camo (camo!)
Gloves on, no evi (no evi!)
Trigger finger, forever ready (grah!)
One man out the jungle (woo!)
One machete turn you to spaghetti (uh!)
One bullet, one headshot
It's sad to say it made his legs lock (a-ha ha ha ha ha!) (shh!)
Don't call the cops (call the cops!)
Wrap his body, put it in a box (wrap it up!)
If you the Huncho then you make the drop
Gotta pay for the dirt that you doin' off top (woo!)
I pay for mine when I see his head
That's the same way the gladiators did (gladiator!)
I'm the gunman but I love the kids (woo!)
Quavo Superman, Quavo John Wick (uh!)
And you don't want the two to mix (not at all!)
Have a Fourth of July on the sixth (pa-pa-baow!) (woo!)
When you broke, pay the bills, bitch (bitch!)
But when you rich, you can kill shit (rich!) (woo!)
I'm John Wick with the black tints
Got gun peepholes on my car kits (woo!)

[Chorus: Quavo]
All black, one gunman
John Wick, that's a bad man
All black, one gunman
John Wick (baow!)
All black, one gunman
John Wick (John Wick)
All black, one gunman
John Wick (woo-oop!)
All black, one gunman
John Wick, gunman
All black, one gunman
John Wick, one gunman
All black, one gunman
John Wick, baow man!
All black, one gunman
John Wick (John Wick)

[Verse 2: Takeoff]
When them niggas killed my dawg Pistol P
A nigga turned into John Wick (Pistol!)
I told 'em my Mustang was not for sale
But they still tried me like my name was John Wick (I told 'em!)
These niggas don't know who they fuckin' with (John Wick!)
Bodies poppin' up unfortunately (bah-bah!)
I'ma catch him slippin' just like Ricky (bah-bah!)
When you plottin' on a nigga, shit get ugly (ooh!) (grraow, grraow!)
John Wick (pew, pew!)
Call of Duty shit (pew, pew!)
When it come to the artillery, I'm very talented
Takeoff Dahmer, I be killin' shit (argh!)
Mini AK with the banana clip
When I travel, put it in my travel kit (grrah!)
Rick James, I'm rich, bitch (rich, bitch!)
Momma told me I'm a walkin' lick (momma!)
The trap game is Madden, no need to ask Madden
I just hit the plug with the hitstick (boom!)
No Santa Claus, I'm on my Grinch shit
Fuck it, might light the block up like it's Christmas (grrah!)
I'd be a fool if I leave a witness (huh?)
Come through your chimney to the kitchen (ooh!)
Scope on the chopper, I see you chillin'
Hit you and your wife and I leave the children

[Chorus: Quavo]
All black, one gunman
John Wick, that's a bad man
All black, one gunman
John Wick (baow!)
All black, one gunman
John Wick (John Wick)
All black, one gunman
John Wick (woo-oop!)
All black, one gunman
John Wick, gunman
All black, one gunman
John Wick, one gunman
All black, one gunman
John Wick, baow man!
All black, one gunman
John Wick (John Wick)

[Verse 3: Offset]
All black (black!), Hatchback (skrrt!)
Got the chopper in the trunk of that (grraow!)
Kidnap the nephew, where yo uncle at? (Kidnap!)
Sellin', the junkie stepped on like a welcome mat (go!)
Feel like the president since they killed Pistol (Pistol!)
Got the pistol lookin' at you, now you sentimental (lookin'!)
Thinkin' to himself, how did he get up in a pickle? (How?)
I can get you knocked down by a nigga want a nickel (uh!)
Hail Mary (woo!)
Make it look like Halloween up in February (woah!)
Birds in the trap singin' Mary Mary (brr!)
Bullets tickle yo stomach like Pillsbury (grah!)
Look for him every day till you find him (find him!)
Cut off his wife's finger to remind him (remind him!)
Do a drive-by when I say, Simon (say so!)
Send him to kill ya, that’s a assignment (go get him!)
Set this shit on fire, change the climate (fire!)
Throw the body in the river up in Winder (ah!)
I get you knocked off even if it's minor (minor!)
Cookin' up the dope, sneezin', fuck wit' my sinus (oh!)
I'm with the shit, fuck nigga, I'm John Wick (baow!)
Hit his ass with the gauge and it hurt my wrist (ah!)
Reach for the chain and his body glitch (baow, baow, baow!)
50 Cent a.k.a. the magic stick (grrah!)

[Chorus: Quavo]
All black, one gunman
John Wick, that's a bad man
All black, one gunman
John Wick (baow!)
All black, one gunman
John Wick (John Wick)
All black, one gunman
John Wick (woo-oop!)
All black, one gunman
John Wick, gunman
All black, one gunman
John Wick, one gunman
All black, one gunman
John Wick, baow man!
All black, one gunman
John Wick (John Wick)
