[Verse 1: Travis Scott & Quavo]
Swipe me, swipe me, swipe me
Swipe me, swipe me, swipe me
Lo-Fi, Lo-Fi, low tide (low tide)
High five, high five, high times
Hot box in the 6 speed (skrrt)
Pour the birds in a 10 piece (brr, brr, brr, Huncho)
Hunnid racks in my skinnies (hunnid racks)
Blowin' gas out the BP (gas)
Major League not the Indies (yah)
Heatin' up never tempt me (yah)
Spin the top, windows up, in the cut, rollin' up (yuh)
Like so ice cold, in that bowl
You can't go, you can't go, ah, you can't go
'Cause they say, "We start a riot at our shows"
Hot box in the 6 speed (skrrt)
Pour the birds in a 10 piece (brr)

[Verse 2: Offset & Quavo]
Suicide (pew)
Suicide in the Lambo', come and die (die)
Live your live—live—, don't kill my vibe (vibe)
See the money, I go get it, I'm in stride (go)
She like the ride—ride—, depends on [?] ride (ride)
Oh, I'm 'bout to pull out the Benz, uh
She gone to takin' off panties (wow)
Get on the private Miami (pew)
Diamonds on me and they dancin'
Owens, I zip up my boots
Morning, I...
