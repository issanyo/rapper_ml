[Chorus: Quavo]
Go, go (woo) go, go (go)
From the Nawf to the Mo (Mo), 500K just to host (5)
Go, go (yeah) go, go (go)
The neighbors too nosy, pack my bags and go (go)
Go, go (skrrt) go, go (skrrt)
Serve me a brick at the store (brick)
Lookin' like Shaq in the post (Shaq)
Go, go (yeah) go, go (go)
Go, go (yeah) go, go (go)

[Verse 1: Travis Scott]
Drive from the Hills to the Mo (yeah yeah)
Yeah, baby at window, like don't go (alright!)
In this world, everything slow mo (it's lit!)
Yeah behind this wall, there is no photos (straight up!)
Jump out this bitch (yeah!) pogo, yeah (bounce)
Across my neck, yeah, logo (ice)
Watch how you pour an eighth, yeah, ocho
I need some more, it's late, yeah, pronto

[Verse 2: Quavo]
Huncho, yeah
Jumped out the coupe with the black insides
You would think I'm racist
Smokin' cookie in Atlanta everywhere
You would think it's recreation (gas)
You already know we made it (made it)
We ain't even gotta say shit (no)
Some of the traps were licks (trap)
Some of the traps were vacant
Junior Seau, bring the Bay out, bring the Bay out
Nigga want talk, we bring the K out, let the spray now
J's gon' walk right in that pot, we beat it up, Pacquiao
Invade your block, we stay on top, ain't nobody safe now

[Chorus: Quavo]
Go, go (woo) go, go (go)
From the Nawf to the Mo (Mo), 500K just to host (5)
Go, go (yeah) go, go (go)
The neighbors too nosy, pack my bags and go (go)
Go, go (skrrt) go, go (skrrt)
Serve me a brick at the store (brick)
Lookin' like Shaq in the post (Shaq)
Go, go (yeah) go, go (go)
Go, go (yeah) go, go (go)

[Outro: Quavo]
Go, go, go, go, go
Goooo
Go, go, go, go, go
Go, go, go, go, go
