[Intro]
Tay Keith, fuck these niggas up!

[Pre-Chorus]
Two more drinks, bet she go in, for sure (Two)
Low key dates, uh, nobody knows (No, nobody)
Get your rake 'cause there's money on the floor (Money)
Get your gang 'cause they hating on the low (Gang)

[Chorus]
We can make diamonds shine (Ice) on the darkest nights (Uh!)
She can make diamonds shine (Shine) on the darkest nights

[Verse 1]

Forget the cops (Fuck the cops), that's how we rock (How we goin')
This a Glock (That it, that it), you silly opps (Silly)
I Got the drop (Got that drop) on your pops (On your daddy)
Drip drop (Drip), get a mop (Get it)
Flood the clock (Flood it), ice box (Ice, ice)
It still leaks like Nene (Leakin')
Let it take some time to heal, achilles (Marinate)
I put the bitch inside the tee-pee (Hibernate)
She say her hair was indie, you get me?

[Chorus]
We can make diamonds shine (Ice) on the darkest nights (Uh!)
She can make diamonds shine (Shine) on the darkest nights

[Verse 2]
Watch her shine shine then like a VVS (Shine)

She gone do you down bad, hit you with finesse (Finesse)
Why you do that then, why she do the boy like that? (Haha)
