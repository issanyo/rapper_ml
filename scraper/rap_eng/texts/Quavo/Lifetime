[Chorus: Ryan Destiny & Quavo]
So when you turned nothing into something
And we still got time
Dim the lights and we still gon' shine
Take the wheel and we still gon' ride
(Yeah-yeah, Quavo)

[Verse 1: Quavo & Ryan Destiny]
I paid all my bills for a lifetime (bills)
Shawty said she love me for a lifetime (she love me)
I went to the jeweler told 'em "Ice mine" (icy)
So I can stand outside and be your sunshine
All these sacrifices damn I made it look easy (damn)
Doing shows on the road know ya need me (road)
Shout out to my lifetime and I'm not talkin' bout tv
One time for the grind, for the time
That you keep ya whole life just to see the bright lights
With the shine, comes the shade
And with the love, comes the hate
I guess I made it, mama I finally made it
So glad we made it, it feels so good to make it

[Chorus: Ryan Destiny & Quavo]
So when you turned nothing into something
And we still got time (turn up)
Dim the lights and we still gon' shine (gon' shine)
Take the wheel and we still gon' ride
It's real and this here is all mine
Turned nothing into something
And we still got time (got time)
Dim the lights and we still gon' shine (gon' shine)
Take the wheel and we still gon' ride (keep runnin')
It's real and this here is all mine

[Refrain: Ryan Destiny & Quavo]
For a lifetime, lifetime, yeah
Lifetime, lifetime
For a lifetime, lifetime, yeah
Lifetime, lifetime
Lifetime, for a lifetime
Lifetime
Lifetime, for a lifetime

[Verse 2: Ryan Destiny]
They can take this away
Take my dream take my spot
All I got, believe I'm gon' give it
And if it's mine
Believe I'm gon' get it

[Chorus: Ryan Destiny]
So when you turned nothing into something
And we still got time (still got time)
Dim the lights and we still gon' shine (still gon' shine)
Take the wheel and we still gon' ride (still gon' ride)
It's real and this here is all mine
Turned nothing into something
And we still got time (still got time)
Dim the lights and we still gon' shine (still gon' shine)
Take the wheel and we still gon' ride (keep runnin')
It's real and this here is all mine

[Refrain: Ryan Destiny]
For a lifetime, lifetime, yeah (for a lifetime)
Lifetime, lifetime (for a lifetime)
For a lifetime, lifetime, yeah (for a lifetime)
Lifetime, lifetime
For a lifetime
