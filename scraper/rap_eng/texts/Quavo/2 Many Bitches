[Hook: Quavo and Skippa da Flippa]
I woke up in the stars
I woke up in the stars
I'm geeking I just bought a bar
In the club I feel like I'm on Mars
Walk in my V.I.P. section, you gone see too many bitches
Walk in my V.I.P. section, you gone see too many bitches

[Verse 1: Quavo]
Dab Dab dab
I blessed the world with the dab
I used to trap off a half
Now I ball like I play with the Mavs
Back then a hoe didn't want me
Now that I'm hot, I'm Mike Jones
I walk in the club like I own it
In the V.I.P. section, I'm stoning
4 in the morning
Pipe a bag 4 in the morning
Your bitch want to fuck cause she's corny
Your bitch want to fuck cause she's horny
She told me she like my performance
She say you be giving her oranges
I beat it she leave in the morning
Then I hang your bitch up like an ornament

[Hook: Quavo and Skippa da Flippa]
I woke up in the stars
I woke up in the stars
I'm geeking I just bought a bar
In the club I feel like I'm on Mars
Walk in my V.I.P. section, you gone see too many bitches
Walk in my V.I.P. section, you gone see too many bitches


[Verse 2: Skippa da Flippa]
I woke up in the stars
I woke up in my car
Keep the pocket then I flip it on the boulevard
Call up Domingo, he might pull you apart
Catch me dabbing in the fresh pair of [?]
First round draft pick just like I was Troy Aikman
We flip these hoes, we don't do no cake
Stop all the fake and count cash like Freemason
Might drop a 4 in the liter
Might have her run though but I don't need her
Met her in the club, fucked the next time I seen her
Who fresher than me, I know no one is cleaner
I dropped me a zipper she loved my Moscato
She finna' start drinking and swallow the bottle
I love me some strippers and love me some models
I hit her with the pound so she can hit me with the follow

[Hook: Quavo and Skippa da Flippa]
I woke up in the stars
I woke up in the stars
I'm geeking I just bought a bar
In the club I feel like I'm on Mars
Walk in my V.I.P. section, you gone see too many bitches
Walk in my V.I.P. section, you gone see too many bitches
