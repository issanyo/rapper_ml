[Intro: Gucci Mane, Quavo, & Joe Gifted]
Joe Gifted
Wizzop
Quavo
Brrr
These hoes thirsty, need water
Wrist game on water
Neck piece on water

[Chorus: Joe Gifted]
These hoes thirsty, need water
Wrist game on water
Neck piece on water
Stay down stay down
Come up, you come up
In that order
It's been a long time, long grind
Time to shine, gotta get rich
Fuck these niggas, fuck these bitches
Ain't got time for y'all bullshit
I want a big bag, big bag, big house, big stash, a lot of cash
Kid straight, fam straight
I ran it up, you know I get a lot of that

[Verse 1: Quavo]
I got a big bag, all blue bills, walkin' 'round with cash
Fourteen seventy-nine, all the way the deal, studio had bags
I need a big stash, big stash, biggest stash, biggest stash
Now it's all fun and games, rest my brothers in the coupe and don't crash
Need a big scale, big bale, fishscale, all trap shit
Havin' big drip, big spill, big spill, hope it don't leak
Call me janitor, maintenance man, 'cause I got all the damn keys
You can take me to the block for real, 'cause I make that shit look easy
Packs in, ziplocs, got the streets in a gridlock
Got to shock the whole big pot, turn the stove to a wristwatch
Your bitch, in order, my neck, make water
Big hunchos, no quarters
Don't drown in that water, need snorkels

[Chorus: Joe Gifted]
These hoes thirsty, need water
Wrist game on water
Neck piece on water
Stay down stay down
Come up, you come up
In that order
It's been a long time, long grind
Time to shine, gotta get rich
Fuck these niggas, fuck these bitches
Ain't got time for y'all bullshit
I want a big bag, big bag, big house, big stash, a lot of cash
Kid straight, fam straight
I ran it up, you know I get a lot of that

[Verse 2: Joe Gifted]
Fam straight, kid straight
Rent paid, got it on me, 10K
New look, temp fade
Bad bitch with me, yeah Kim K
Money calling, pick up or Jumpman, 23, MJ
Ain't going back to jail, that's a no, no no Mikembe

[Chorus: Joe Gifted]
These hoes thirsty, need water
Wrist game on water
Neck piece on water
Stay down, stay down
Come up, you come up
In that order
It's been a long time, long grind
Time to shine, gotta get rich
Fuck these niggas, fuck these bitches
Ain't got time for y'all bullshit
I want a big bag, big bag, big house, big stash, a lot of cash
Kid straight, fam straight
I ran it up, you know I get a lot of that

[Verse 2: Gucci Mane]
Big old diamond necklaces, I'm handsome and reckless
I spend cash for the thrill of it, my young niggas move militant
That new V12, I ordered it, he started it, we slaughtered it
My left right wrist I watered it, my ears on that retarded shit
Guwop on that remix so you know they brought that bag out
I can't wait to do the video and bring that glass out
Keisha ridin' shotgun in my new drop, I feel like Ca$h Out
So much cash in her Birkin, that bitch a walkin' stashhouse
Order whipped with cool water, just jumped a cool quarter
If she ain't shaped like a Coke bottle, then I do not bother
Trap rap godfather, y'all need to try harder
Bruce Willis, die harder, got her on ice water

[Chorus: Joe Gifted]
These hoes thirsty, need water
Wrist game on water
Neck piece on water
Stay down, stay down
Come up, you come up
In that order
It's been a long time, long grind
Time to shine, gotta get rich
Fuck these niggas, fuck these bitches
Ain't got time for y'all bullshit
I want a big bad, big bag, big house, big stash, a lot of cash
Kid straight, fam straight
I ran it up, you know I get a lot of that
