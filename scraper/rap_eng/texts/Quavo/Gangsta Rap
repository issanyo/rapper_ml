[Intro]
We're not against rap
We're not against rappers
But we are against those Migos

[Hook: Quavo]
Gangsta rap is back
Gangsta rap is back
Gangsta rap is back
Gangsta rap is back
Gangsta rap is back

[Verse 1: Quavo]
Fuck the media, fuck
They hatin' on a young gangsta
We put the bando in the Wikipedia
Still these niggas ain't thankful

[Verse 2: Takeoff]
Migo Gang, we the most dangerous
Narcotics made a nigga famous
If you bangin' twist your fingers
Throw a party for the gangstas

[Verse 3: Quavo]
We the biggest gangstas at the top of the list
Gave my brothers no bond and said they a flight risk
They recordin', reportin', Fox 5 on my dick
I just gave them information 'bout my new bitch

[Verse 4: Takeoff]
They asking me questions
No information no participatin', ain't no conversation
They hatin' I made it, speculatin'
Takin' 'bout how many drugs in that vacant

[Verse 5: Quavo]
Gangsta rap comin' back like a nigga got 80's crack with an 8-track
Come in your house, where the safe at?
Homey don't play that

[Verse 6: Takeoff]
Young niggas we bringin' back gangsta rap
I put that dope right up where your bitch anal at
My brothers keep a girlfriend in my cul-de-sac
When the white people see me have a heart attack, cause of that...

[Hook: Quavo]
Gangsta rap is back
Gangsta rap is back
Gangsta rap is back
Gangsta rap is back
Gangsta rap is back
