[Intro: Quavo]
Whoa!
Oh!
Shout out C-note
C-note

[Hook: Quavo]
Lil mama walked up on me started whispering to me
She telling me the freaky things she wanna do to me (Freak)
She telling me she soak and wet she go wet up my sheets
I'm sorry, I can't help it
I just rather that you show me
She gone show me, don't tell me (whoo)
Just show me, don't tell me (oh)
Just show me and don't tell me (no)
Just show me, dont tell me (oh)
Just show me and don't tell me (no)
Just show me no don't tell me (whoo)
Just show me and don't ell me (no)
Just show me no don't tell me

[Verse 1: Swift]
Show me something 'fore you shake something
You gone have to do it like it ain't nothing
Saw the way I do it and you came running
See we be on a wave and the wave coming
Bottles on the pain keep the pain coming
So you got have to show me you be really poppin
We gone break a ounce down let's get clouded
And every time I come around we just slick wildin'
But I can even trip cause I like that shit
You shine like a diamond like something on a wrist
Got all dressed up just so you can come strip
If you gone show some i need more than a glimpse
Show me don't tell me no (no)
I was gone off that alcohol (yes, yeah)
And then..

She said that she wet like tsunami that's the whole damn ocean (splash)
But if I take her to the room will she really bust it open (huh)
And you know that she will ima young rich nigga worth millions (know that she will)
When I let her ride in the coupe have the sun around my goddamn ceiling (had it at the top)
And my shooter gone shoot gotta sniper at the top of the building (top of the building)
I just wanna show you fuck the whole conversation  (no talkin!)
You tellin me now that you want me (want me)

Niggas in the hood call up they sisters I dont know if they a homie
