[Intro: 2 Chainz]
Uh-uh, yeah
I do it
2 Chainz, okay

[Verse 1: 2 Chainz]
I met a girl named Destiny, I ride big like a SUV (big)
I refuse to be a refugee (nah), I use revenge as my recipe (uh)
Ass-whooping so separately (alright), know what I'm talkin' bout (yeah)
Yellow tape, then we chalk 'em out (chalk 'em out)
Was gon' do a driveby, but we walkin' now (bow, bow, bow)
End of the day, family's the only thing I got (I got)
You got a sweet tooth? Them doughnuts in the parkin' lot (skrrt)
Nighttime, we see sparks a lot
Yeah, I swim with the sharks a lot
Yeah, I'm lit like a arson, arsenal out the box
An' I still shoot 'em orthodox, bang, bang

[Chorus: Breyan Isaac & 2 Chainz]
One more ride, one more race (yeah)
We go all out 'cause ain't no breaks (yeah)
Here we go, all the way (yeah)
We don't slow down 'cause ain't no breaks
I roll on, I'ma ride or die (true)
It don't matter what we face (true)
See me goin' out, ride or die (woo, woo, woo)
I'm the master of my fate (woo, woo, woo)
One more, one more night
And this time, we gon' ride forever

[Verse 2: Quavo]
Takin' off and I'm ridin' on the road now
Hit the gas, no brakes, gotta go now
Put my life on the line, yeah, it's on me
Blood rushin' through my veins, no IV
Ride, switchin' lanes, you can't stop me (skrrt, skrrt)
You can smell the propane when you pass me (propane)
Ride for the gang because I'm the chief (gang, gang)
Helicopter hoverin', it's high speed
Chase, drive, straight (ride)
I'ma, race, to the, cake
Flame, on it, no chain, on me (on me)
All of, us, became, homies

[Chorus: Quavo]
One more ride, one more race
We go all out, we don't play
One more night, one more day
We go all out, we don't play
I'ma go off, I'ma ride tonight
It don't matter what we face
I'ma go off, I'ma ride tonight
I'm the master of my fate
I'ma go off, I'ma go off, I'ma go off
I'ma go off, I gotta go now

[Outro: Quavo]
Yeah, yeah
Yeah-yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
Yeah-yeah, yeah
