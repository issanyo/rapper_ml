[Intro: Quavo]
Yuhhh ayy, yuh, yuh
Ayy, yuh yuh

[Chorus: Quavo]
I got more Keys than Alicia (keys)
These niggas be talkin', policin' (12)
I took your ho, then released her (ho)
I used to trap out a Regal (uh)
Two hundred thousand on my wrist (hundred)
I thought it all was a fantasy (ayy)
Two hundred thousand on my wrist
Lord I hope it don't vanish (god)
Two hundred thousand on my wrist
I told my mama don't panic (mama)
Two hundred thousand on my wrist (two hundred)
I bought her heat with a dragon
Two hundred thousand on my wrist (two hundred)
Who thought I would be livin' life like this?
Two hundred thousand on my wrist
You probably thought I couldn't buy this shit

[Verse 1: Quavo]
Wrist drownin' in the water
Trappin' early Tom Joyner
Beat the pot, George Foreman (beat it up)
J's go nuts, acornin'
Look at me now, I'm soarin'
Look at the lean I'm pourin'
Come get your ho, she annoyin'
We toss her up like a coin
24 hours, geekin' on a tower
Shootin' at you cowards
'Cause my wrist two hundred thousand
If a nigga try to take it
I swear to god he ain't gon' make it
Back to the bando, the basics
Seein' green numbers, The Matrix
Look at that boy with the ice on
Catching plays Jerry Rice on me
I know niggas that'll get you nigga
If a nigga put the right price on it
Remember the days on the northside
Hit for a rack on the dice homie
Now I take the mic and stand on the stage
I p-p-p-pipe on it
And if you lookin' at me wrong
I got some niggas that's right on 'em
All these flawless stones
I bet your hoe gon' bite on 'em
Smokin' this gas get rid of the pain
You might think I got Glaucoma
Niggas might think I'm servin' the J's
'Cause I'm walkin' with these rocks on me

[Chorus: Quavo]
I got more Keys than Alicia (keys)
These niggas be talkin', policin' (12)
I took your ho, then released her (ho)
I used to trap out a Regal (uh)
Two hundred thousand on my wrist (hundred)
I thought it all was a fantasy (ayy)
Two hundred thousand on my wrist
Lord I hope it don't vanish (god)
Two hundred thousand on my wrist
I told my mama don't panic (mama)
Two hundred thousand on my wrist
I bought her heat with a dragon
Two hundred thousand on my wrist
Who thought I would be livin' life like this?
Two hundred thousand on my wrist
You probably thought I couldn't buy this shit

[Verse 2: Lil Uzi Vert]
White diamonds on my neck
White diamonds on my fist
I just got a white bitch
And she whippin' up the brick
In the trap my car, yeah it got that motor
I do not want that lil bitch
If that bitch is really not on mind, deep throat
Ayy, told that bitch eat out my oldest
She stick that dick en la boc'
I just be pitchin' her Raf like I'm floatin (yaaaaaah)
Mixin' the lean with cream soda (yeah)
Young nigga but my money gettin' older, ayy
Look at these bitches, they tellin' on me
But my lil' bitch, she like "So what?"
Look at my money, that's L-O-V-E
Smokin' that gas like a stoner
Nowadays fuckin' my bitches in threes
Ayy, â€˜Member I'm watchin' TV
Ayy, nowadays I'm on TV
Ayy, Migo and Thugger baby yeah
Yeah, I just be countin' these G's
Yeah, I feel like I am Swizz Beatz
I got them Alicia Keys
I got them Alicia Keys
I got them Alicia Keys
I got them Alicia Keys

[Chorus: Quavo]
I got more Keys than Alicia (keys)
These niggas be talkin', policin' (12)
I took your ho, then released her (ho)
I used to trap out a Regal (uh)
Two hundred thousand on my wrist (hundred)
I thought it all was a fantasy (ayy)
Two hundred thousand on my wrist
Lord I hope it don't vanish (god)
Two hundred thousand on my wrist
I told my mama don't panic (mama)
Two hundred thousand on my wrist
I bought her heat with a dragon
Two hundred thousand on my wrist
Who thought I would be livin' life like this?
Two hundred thousand on my wrist
You probably thought I couldn't buy this shit

[Verse 3: Shad Da God]
Hundred thousand on my wrist
Bustin' at you, lil bitch
I just poured a lil Drizzy Drake
I just poured a lil six (that mud)
I be lettin' a bag go for Blake
32 and that 6 (Blake Griffin)
They be feelin' like Rico
Why you ain't called me on that?
I serve you out the backdoor
Nigga I serve you out the window
(I serve you out the window)
I serve you out the front door
Nigga I serve you out the car door
Laid back like OGG
200,000 on auto
Carbon 15 with the button on
Make me put it on auto (spray it)
Free the GOAT, that's Roscoe
We gon' still be at the top though
'Member we was on the block though
Hundred rounds and a Glock though
Came a long way from the zips of the mid, it was perfect
Stayed down all my motherfuckin' life, it was worth it
