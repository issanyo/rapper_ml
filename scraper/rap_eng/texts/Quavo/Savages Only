[Intro]
This goes out to all my cops killing innocent victims
Fuck around, get gunned down
Go get em, go get em, go get em
I'm turnin' myself to a villain
I'm turnin' myself to a villain

[Hook]

Take off the plug, he went up on the ticket
Yes I'm the man, I'm Chapo in your city
Yes I'm the man, I'm Huncho in my city

[Verse 2: Offset]
Kick in the door for the blow
Oh you don't know?
I'ma shoot off your toe
I got a hoe
She set up your trap, she get pistol whipped like I don't know
This is for the savages only
Walk in the club with the fire right on me
You get holes in your shirt like you homeless
God damn, what happened to homie?
This ain't no pretend-o, you see the extendo
Open the door chopper hang out the window
Bando, boards on the window
Blow in the trap like a Nintendo 64
Bitch I'm a villain I used to be stealin'
This a hotbox told the bitch that I rented it
Look at my wrap sheet, crimes I committed
I was in love with the streets I admit it
I got a milli, I get you fitted
Migo the gang you can't join the committee
He got knocked off God damn, who did it?
Questions like that don't get asked in my city
Jumped off the porch then jumped in the Bentley
Bitch this the reason I'm actin' so ignorant
Don't know how to act I'm a savage, a grimlin
You get caught at the red light while textin' and chillin'
(slippin')

[Verse 3: Takeoff]
On the block with the Glock out
Got the strap on me kids and the cops out
Wanna knuckle up get knocked out
Made my first dime when I dropped out
This for my niggas that's in the trap house
Trap look like a show and it be packed out
If you talkin' artillery then we cashed out
Life is a gamble but these niggas crap out (bitch)
Young niggas on the block asking for a dub
Kick a nigga off of there show a nigga love
Watchin', and plottin', and itchin', and bitin' up on a mission
Tryna catch a nigga slippin' cause he's on drugs
Them chickens take a bath I put em' in a tub
Fuckin' these bitches don't want no scrub
She want that dough but that nigga showin' no love
Keep that pocket rocket now pocket like Elmer Fudd
First door I kicked in, the gat from the nigga then the 10 then the 15 turned into a dub
First time I poured up nigga it was a zip now it's fours and fifths, nigga I'm talkin' real mud
Can't tell my brothers nothin when they see niggas mean muggin don't ask questions just pull out the slugs
Say the right thing at the wrong time or the wrong place, broad day we gon' wet your ass up

[Hook]
Savages only, savages only
Savages only, savages only
This right here for all my savage homies
I put on for all my savages
This right here for all my savage homies
I put on for all my savages
Savages only, savages only
Savages only, savages only
This right here for all my savage homies
