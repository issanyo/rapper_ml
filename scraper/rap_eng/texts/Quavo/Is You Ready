[Post-Hook: Quavo]
We came here to see just what you got (uhh)
No, no, no, not on my watch (no way)

[Break: Takeoff]
Are you ready?
You know what time it is, right?
They don't want us to make it, so it's time to take it
Ayy

[Verse 1: Takeoff]
Ridin' with them killers, it's time to see who be realer
Unload it, empty the clip on 'em, make sure these people feel it (brr)
I'm shootin' like Reggie Miller, don't move, or I'ma hit you (move)
Cop a pound, turn it to you, I call it the Lemonilla (ayy)
Scope on the bean, no more shin-picks, I hit ya from distance (pew-pew-pew)
We came out the trenches with extensions, God is my witness (God)
And I gotta get that first shot off before that bullet hit me (grrah)
Ain't gotta worry about lookin' back when my squad with me (no)

[Verse 2: Offset]
Hoppin' out the trunk (hop out) with the killers lookin' like Thriller
I'm ready for the millions, talk to myself in the mirror
Is you ready? (ready?) Jump off in that Bentley with no ceilings
Is you ready? (is you?) Sick of takin' losses, time for winnin' (winnin')
They can't hang with us, can't bang with us (nah)
They know we armed and dangerous (dangerous)
If you think you fuckin' with my squad, better hang it up (squad)
We been grindin' hard (grind), can't take that from us
We been grindin' hard on the jump, can't take that from us (nah)
