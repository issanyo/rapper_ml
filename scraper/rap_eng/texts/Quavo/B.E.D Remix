[Intro: Jacquees]
Aye, aye we only drinkin' GTV
When we with Stunna, ya dig what I'm sayin'?
So much water on me like I'm gettin' sea sick, yeah it's the remix
Jacquees, Huncho, so many chains on me, 'Dolla $ign
(Nash B chillin')

[Verse 1: Quavo]
I know you wanna ride, it's just you and me (skrt)
So wet I wanna dive, like I'm in the sea (splash)
We livin' comfortably (yeah)
She get addicted to the palm trees (palm trees)
I'mma keep it honestly (honest)
Pull up and the horn'll beep
She can sting like a bumble bee (sting!)
But she rather be under me
We go to Barbados, we makin' tornados
She fuckin' up all the sheets
I ask if she smoke and she told me no
I'm smokin' up all the weed
The first day I hit it, she tell all her friends
And now they on to me

[Verse 2: Jaquees]
Say what it is, whatcha wanna know?
These hoes fallin' out like dominos
I got diamonds in my piece
Yeah, I got diamonds in my piece
Couple bands from another show
Do it on her now she want some more
They still be lookin' out for 'Quees
They still be lookin' out for 'Quees
Broke niggas miss the old me (keep flexin')
Yeah lil' shawty couldn't hold me
I been fucked on the homies
Think it might be the Rollie
Remix on a bih, Quavo sangin' to the bitch
Dolla sangin' to the bitch, I'm Jacquees, I'm tryna hit

[Hook: Jacquees]
I know you wanna love, but I just wanna fuck
And girl you know the deal, I gotta keep it real
I know you wanna see, I know you wanna be
In my B.E.D., grinding slowly
I know you wanna love, but I just wanna fuck
And girl you know the deal, I gotta keep it real
I know you wanna see, I know you wanna be
In my B.E.D., grinding slowly
Ty Dolla Sign

[Verse 3: Ty Dolla Sign]
Know you wanna ride it, know you want me deep inside it
Know I be strokin', just might motor boat ya
Baby oil, rub you down in baby oil
Now you shinin', look just like a diamond
Young nigga and I'm rich, Dolla need a bad bitch
Dolla need that new Rolls with the stars in the ceiling
She promise she can take the D, promise she won't catch feelings
"Dolla I can take the D!" And I won't tell Jacquees

[Hook: Jacquees]
I know you wanna love, but I just wanna fuck
And girl you know the deal, I gotta keep it real
I know you wanna see, I know you wanna be
In my B.E.D., grinding slowly
I know you wanna love, but I just wanna fuck
And girl you know the deal, I gotta keep it real
I know you wanna see, I know you wanna be
In my B.E.D., grinding slowly
Fast life gettin' faster, Jacquees say what?
