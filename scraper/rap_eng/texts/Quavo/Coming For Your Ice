[Intro: Quavo & YRN Lingo]
Migo!
Quavo Huncho on the motherfucking check in
Aye Lingo
I’m giving you the crown my nigga
You passed the test
Rich nigga graduation
Young nigga graduation
The wait is over
No more patience
History
This shit ancient
Lingo!
Aye aye aye, hold up
Aye that’s a nice lil piece you got there bro
Coming for your ice nigga
Aye
Run that shit up
Lingo!
Uhh

[Hook: YRN Lingo]
All black mask
Coming for your ice
You better have it tucked
Coming for your ice
You might just get snuffed
We coming for your ice
You just got bad luck
We coming for your ice
Coming for your ice
Coming for your ice
Coming for your ice
Coming for your ice
We coming for your ice
Coming for your ice
Lingo!

[Verse 1: YRN Lingo]
I’ma send my niggas to go get your ice
If he see him run up with that dope mask they coming for your life
Better think twice about what you say, about what move you make
You might just have to pay
Talking all that reckless shit
We will most likely leave you in the ditch
Praying to god
How did you get yourself in a predicament somewhere like this
We’ll shoot you and your whole clique
Stick you up for your chain, run up that shit
It ain’t a problem to go tell my niggas to go get it
Bringing back that profit, yeah that’s a ticket
Lookin’ at your ice, yes a [?]
You told me yourself you be running your city
Put on my vest, man I feel just like Fifty
All the chains on me, I’m feeling like Slick Rick the Ruler
Please don’t let this rap shit fool ya
Tie you real tight, put you up in a cooler
Lingo always stay with a sack
I’m like Warren Sapp nigga, I stay with the sack
Fuck up my check, I’ma get it right back
You cuff up my ice, putting three in your back
Migo my family and that is a fact
Money is all I see like some contact
My pockets so fat almost had a heart attack
Zooming in the Lambo, ain’t no looking back
I stay in Green Bay ‘cause you know I got it packed
Nigga you not hard because you have a strap
Can’t trust everybody, they not gon’ have your back
Keep watching your neck ‘cause your chain might get snatched

[Hook: YRN Lingo]
All black mask
Coming for your ice
You better have it tucked
Coming for your ice
You might just get snuffed

You just got bad luck
We coming for your ice
Coming for your ice
Coming for your ice
Coming for your ice
Coming for your ice
We coming for your ice
Coming for your ice
Coming for your ice
