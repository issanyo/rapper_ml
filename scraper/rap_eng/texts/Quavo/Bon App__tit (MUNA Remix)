[Pre-Chorus: Katy Perry]
Under candle light, candle light

Please just take your time, (take your) take your time
Eat with your hands, fine

'Cause I'm all that you want, boy
All that you can have, boy
'Cause I'm all that you want, boy
Bon appétit, baby

[Verse 2: Katy Perry]
So you want some more
Well I'm open 24
Wanna keep you satisfied
Customer's always right
Hope you've got some room
For the world's best cherry pie
Gonna hit that bon appé-, hit that, boy
World's best cherry pie

[Chorus: Katy Perry]
'Cause I'm all that you want, boy

Fresh out the oven
Melt in your mouth kind of lovin'
