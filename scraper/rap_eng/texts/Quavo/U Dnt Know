[Hook: Quavo]
Don't act like you don't know I got them racks bitch
Don't act like you don't know I got them packs bitch
Don't act like you don't know I'm wildin' out biiitch
Don't act like you don't know thats who I am bitch
Don't act like you don't know, don't act like you don't know
Don't act like you don't know, don't act like you don't know

[Verse 1: Quavo]
Don't act like you don't know, don't act like you don't know
No Homer Simpson but you know I keep that dough
All white diamonds look just like a line a coke
Like Rozay, Quavo get it off the boat
Smoking loud ass gas, make a nigga choke
And I know you smoking mid, I see that brown smoke
Take your bitch to the mall, she walking out with Coach
Now I got her running plays like I am the coach
Hang them on a rope, soldiers trained to go
All my niggas don't move till I say so
Niggas trapping out a mansion and a Lambo
Can't see the troops cause they wearing camo

[Hook]
Don't act like you don't know I got them racks bitch
Don't act like you don't know I got them packs bitch
Don't act like you don't know I'm wildin' out biiitch
Don't act like you don't know thats who I am bitch
Don't act like you don't know, don't act like you don't know
Don't act like you don't know, don't act like you don't know

[Verse 2: Takeoff]
Don't act like you don't know
2 cups drinkin' on Big Moe
Serve the plug Meta world peace elbow
And I done done it all
No Shawty L-o
Bricks like Soulja, man they always on gold
When you see the squad better act like you know
In the kitchen on the stove with the Marilyn Monroe
[?]
Got the hood saying 'Jumping out the bando'
Niggas mad acting like they don't know
Bill G put terror in your squad
And I walk around pockets on Fat Joe
Nigga walk around with the deuce deuce
Smoking on fat ass blunts Bruce Bruce
Riding in the truck with no motherfucking roof
And it got 2 doors would've thought it was a coupe
Hit the gas in my [?]
Hit hard like a nigga smoking Kimbo
And when I sip the lean, lean low like a nigga playing limbo
Pull up in a drop top lambo
All the kids they scream out 'Bingo'
That bitch who couldn't afford her nigga, taking over like the new world order

[Hook]
Don't act like you don't know I got them racks bitch
Don't act like you don't know I got them packs bitch
Don't act like you don't know I'm wildin' out biiitch
Don't act like you don't know thats who I am bitch
Don't act like you don't know, don't act like you don't know
Don't act like you don't know, don't act like you don't know
