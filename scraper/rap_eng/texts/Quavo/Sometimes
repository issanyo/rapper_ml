(Intro: [Quavo]; Kesean)
[Young Nigga by the way]
Man It just a lot of stuff I think about man
Whole lotta stuff wanna say
Naw for real
I guess
[young nigga by the way]

(Chorus: Kidd Coolin)
Sometimes I wonder am I going to make it out of here
Sometimes I just want to pay myself and make me disappear
Sometimes I gotta ask myself is my life hard to live
Sometimes I gotta tell myself to man up and face your fears
Sometimes, sometimes, sometimes
(just not all the time yeah)
Sometimes, sometimes, sometimes
(just not all the time yeah)

(Verse 1: Kesein Ball)
Sometimes I feel amazing
See life is what you make it
If you want it just be patient
Yeah
I'm so tired of living basic, day to day I'm trying to make it
Ya'll don't know the sacrifices, ya'll just making (ya'll don't know that how?)
I got on my knees and I pray to God
Life was getting hard
Mamma said you want to be a star
You better play your cards
Closed mouths don't get fed nigga
Better eat a star
I started rapping and told mamma, I was gon' never get a job
9 to five that just ain't for me
So just let me be
In the studio is where I sleep (I'm there day in and day out)
Remember niggas used to hate on me
But now I'm on my feet
Every song they got it on repeat
Yeah

(Interlude: Kesean)
I know every last one of them niggas
See a couple of times in my life where I had to think about a lot
(for real)
I was thinking about a lot you deal what I'm saying
(naw for real)
I was like why ye ain't help, why it ain't done
(how you feel)
It made me feel like this

(Chorus: Kidd Coolin)
Sometimes I wonder am I going to make it out of here
Sometimes I just want to pay myself and make me disappear
Sometimes I gotta ask myself is my life hard to live
Sometimes I gotta tell myself to man up and face your fears
Sometimes, sometimes, sometimes
(just not all the time yeah)
Sometimes, sometimes, sometimes
(just not all the time yeah)

(Verse 2: YungMurdda)
Yeah, Sometimes I wanna give up
But the Lord told me I got a life to live up
There's sometimes I want to die, but these things is making me cry
But you know I really love the music and it's really down the ride
(sometimes I feel like music is the only thing that love me
And I'm tellin these other rappers that really ain't above me)
And I do it for my fams
So I'm really bout to go ham
Pull up in a Bentley or a Lamb
That's a fucking plan
I want to die rich, I don't want to die broke
Smoking on the loud
And watching that shit make me choke
I'mma do it cuz sometimes I want to give up
But I was told I got a life to live up

(Interlude: Yung Murdda)
Yeah what you tryna say
They be sayin that I'm nothing
And they calling me lame
But it's because I'm rappin and you can't
In the streets I be trappin mane
I don't know what you sayin but this is all me mane

(Chorus: Kidd Coolin)
Sometimes I wonder am I going to make it out of here
Sometimes I just want to pay myself and make me disappear
Sometimes I gotta ask myself is my life hard to live
Sometimes I gotta tell myself to man up and face your fears
Sometimes, sometimes, sometimes
(just not all the time yeah)
Sometimes, sometimes, sometimes
(just not all the time yeah)

(Verse 3: KingBizzy)
Me, trappin was a habit
But, I had to stay on my huslte, but I had to stay on my grind
I had to put the fuck shit behind
But it was still on my mind
Like I don't who is God or where to find
Yeah, and I lost my birth momma to cancer and I really didn't even find the answer
But I didn't even want to go nowhere
Cuz I'm in the middle of nowhere
I ain't even got no money, I had to grind for a dollar
Poppin guns instead of collars, man we got the four followers
24 only imballa
Everybody try to hollar
But I really only wanted to be a scholar

(Interlude: KingBizzy)
I was out on the fuckin streets
I was with some goons that really wanted some heat
But I don't even know what is going on with me
Is it my life, or is it the shit ain't really complete yeah

(Chorus: Kidd Coolin)
Sometimes I wonder am I going to make it out of here
Sometimes I just want to pay myself and make me disappear
Sometimes I gotta ask myself is my life hard to live
Sometimes I gotta tell myself to man up and face your fears
Sometimes, sometimes, sometimes
(just not all the time yeah)
Sometimes, sometimes, sometimes
(just not all the time yeah)

(Verse 4: Yamine)
Sometimes I wonder if I'm gonna make it out of life
Sometimes I wonder all these lies I tell is worth the price
Niggas keep on flexing and telling me what's right
What's right is them in blue and white, red sirens in a hype (nope)
(man I think you know what I'm talking about right? them cops nigga)
Man them cops niggas, they ops nigga
Snitching niggas seek the help nigga
Fuck niggas get wealth nigga
Bitch niggas get help nigga
I'm in the studio day after fucking day
Every time I go see hoe

I'm just a patient that be waiting
No more stops, no more shaking
I'm Yamine nigga and you know I get to scrapin
Niggas

(Interlude: Yamine)
Man fuck these hating ass niggas

You know who I'm talkin about right
(uh huh man)
Man that's on some real shit dog life
(tell them what happened)
Like every time I wake up in the morning niggas steady hating
And every day I go to work they still hating
(so tell them how you feel)
I feel like this

(Chorus: Kidd Coolin)
Sometimes I wonder am I going to make it out of here
Sometimes I just want to pay myself and make me disappear
Sometimes I gotta ask myself is my life hard to live
Sometimes I gotta tell myself to man up and face your fears
Sometimes, sometimes, sometimes
(just not all the time yeah)
Sometimes, sometimes, sometimes
(just not all the time yeah)

(Verse 5: KeepStackZ)
I told them I'mma make it,but they laughed right in my face
(yeah) now it's 3 bedrooms now you can't check out my place
Now my daughter she wasn't born in the hood
I remember posted up on the six that's where I stood (uh huh)
I'm chilling at the top now my life is going good
(yeah)
Money calling my name Ben Frank, that's change (I got em)
NBA No game, 2 shots to the brain (herd)
Niggas walking in stains, that 40 cal. go bang (brrrrlll!!)
Fuck niggas can't hang they left me down in that dirt (they did)

(Chorus: Kidd Coolin)
Sometimes I wonder am I going to make it out of here

Sometimes, sometimes, sometimes
(just not all the time yeah)
