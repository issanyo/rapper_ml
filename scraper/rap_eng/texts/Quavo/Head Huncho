[Hook: Quavo]
Everybody know we got the birds on the truck load
Fuck with Glizzy Gang and Migos shoot ya like a free throw
Everybody know she don't want nothin' but a blue bankroll
Everybody know young nigga, boss nigga, head huncho
Head huncho, head huncho
'Bout the blue bankroll, we'll cut your head off, head huncho
Head huncho, head huncho
Young nigga, young nigga, flexed up, bossed up, head honcho

[Verse 1: Quavo]
We is the realest young niggas, fuck niggas we do not fuck with em
Black and white all of my Rari's, pulling up looking like Pilgrims
He coming up short with the money, sorry we kidnap the children
Pull up in the Bentley, I'm riding around got his kids in the Bentley
What am I sippin'?, double trouble, color purple, I'm drinkin', no sealin'
We had to go get it
Whether it's kickin' in doors or we coming through ceilings
Migos and Shy Glizzy, when we come together, we makin' a milli
Huncho in my city, you run up on me then we open fire quickly
Do you know what it take to be a huncho?
What would you do, what would you do
Head huncho young nigga making boss moves
Pull out the chopper I aim it that you better move

[Hook: Quavo]
Everybody know we got the birds on the truck load
Fuck with Glizzy Gang and Migos shoot ya like a free throw
Everybody know she don't want nothin' but a blue bankroll
Everybody know young nigga, boss nigga, head huncho
Head huncho, head huncho
'Bout the blue bankroll, we'll cut your head off, head huncho
Head huncho, head huncho
Young nigga, young nigga, flexed up, bossed up, head honcho

[Verse 2: Shy Glizzy]
Bitch my name is Young Jefe
I got the OG and the ratchet
God damn ATL too happy
Pull up on yo ass like a taxi
I am not the one to worry with a problem
Boy yo ass gotta run
Ram truck with the shooters in the trunk
And they dressed up like a nun
Quavo said we don't need label
Young rich niggas we stable
Can I borrow some sugar Miss Mable?
We in the bando with no cable
The hood they treat me like Jesus
Breakin' one out in a grey coupe
I think I'm John Gotti in grapefruit
I hop out the Porsche in a grey suit

[Hook: Quavo]
Everybody know we got the birds on the truck load
Fuck with Glizzy Gang and Migos shoot ya like a free throw
Everybody know she don't want nothin' but a blue bankroll
Everybody know young nigga, boss nigga, head huncho
Head huncho, head huncho
'Bout the blue bankroll, we'll cut your head off, head huncho
Head huncho, head huncho
Young nigga, young nigga, flexed up, bossed up, head honcho

[Verse 3: Offset]
Head huncho, they calling me Pablo
Italian plug, eating Maggiano's
Pull out the chopper, knock em down like dominos
Spinning my wrist around the pot like a merry-go
It's cartel, when it comes to dawgs, you get knocked out
Bullets the same size as a golf ball
You niggas is bitchin' and my niggas they pull up extentions
They hit you fuck niggas you gonna need stitches
.45 in my britches, you niggas been talking that life
When you know you ain't seen it
Giuseppe steppin', got me walkin' on lizards
Ice on the top of my bezel, a blizzard
Walk in the mall, I can buy what I want
Keep down the cryin', I kidnap his aunt
I'm a big dog and you lil niggas runts
Beat em with the pistols, smoke em like joints
Laser beam sit on his head, it's on point
Rubbin' money in my hand like its ointment
When I talk to the boss make em appointment
Can't trap on my block, fuck nigga get extorted
Fuckin' your bitch, better go talk to Maury
Reptile my Louboutins, walkin' safari
Alley oop dunkin yo bitch like Charles Barkley
.44 bulldog, don't make it start barking

[Hook: Quavo]
Everybody know we got the birds on the truck load
Fuck with Glizzy Gang and Migos shoot ya like a free throw
Everybody know she don't want nothin' but a blue bankroll
Everybody know young nigga bought  me a head huncho
Head huncho, head huncho
'Bout the blue bankroll, we'll cut your head off, head huncho
Head huncho, head huncho
Young nigga, young nigga, flexed up, bossed up, head honcho
