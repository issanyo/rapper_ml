I know some trappers that's richer than rappers (x8)
Your favorite rapper, ain't rich as your average trapper (x3)
I know some trappers that's richer than rappers (x2)

[Verse 1: Quavo]
Your average trapper might be as rich as your favorite rapper
Flexing in front of the camera
Balling like he got the stamina
Really he don't even amount to nothin'
What is your worth?
Boy you a turd
Real trappers on the curb
Real trappers like to serve
You want that life that he deserve
Dope boys buy a car and they owning
Rap niggas get the car and they renting
I know some trappers that worth about fifty
I know some trappers that's living like Diddy
I know some trappers that took more shots than 50
Shout out to my nigga 50
And I know some rappers that's still penny penching, still trynna' get a digit
I'm a real rapper nigga, check my bank account, I bet you see a milli
I'm a real rapper nigga, shout out to the trappers trapping in the city
Trappers slash rapper nigga, might catch a nigga trapping out a Bentley
You a trapper slash actor nigga, you would take a Oscar or an Emmy
Free my nigga Offset, all my niggas thugging ain't no pretending
When I was out trapping, you working at Wendy's
I got a pint of some drink and on Denny's
When I trap a brick, you might think I'm at Benny's
I keep a rack on me like I play tennis
Play with the weight like I'm at LA Fitness
Trapper slash rapper I handle my business
Pull out the chopper boy go mind your business
I pop a perc and then come to my senses
Add the shit out and I don't leave a witness
Shout out to trappers that trapping at Whitney
Migo the gang brung the north to the city
Met with some trappers that's running the city
Made an empire, QC we submitting
Started from nothing, and now we worth millions
If you a real trapper, I know that you feel this
At the table with the plug like the Indians and Pilgrims
My niggas don't give no fuck 'bout your feelings
I know some trappers, got M's in the ceiling
