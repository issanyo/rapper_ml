[Intro: Quavo]
Drugs, drugs
Drugs, drugs
Drugs, drugs
Drugs, drugs
Drugs, drugs
Drugs, drugs
Drugs, drugs
Drugs, drugs

[Chorus: Quavo]
I put a mill in the attic
I fell in love with the drugs, I think I'm a addict
Percocet, molly, and Xanax (Molly)
I feel like I land on the planet (Planet)
I'm on Designer drugs, on Designer drugs, on Designer drugs (Desginer)
I'm on Designer drugs, on Designer drugs, on Designer drugs (Designer)
I put a mill in the attic
I fell in love with the drugs, I think I'm a addict
Percocet, molly, and Xanax (Molly)
I feel like I land on the planet
I'm on Designer drugs, on Designer drugs, on Designer drugs (Designer)
I'm on Designer drugs, on Designer drugs, on Designer drugs (Designer)

[Verse 1: Quavo]
I put a four in a liter (I did)
I used to trap out a Regal (I did)
My mom used to trap off a beeper (My mom)
I look at the molly and eat them (My molly)
I am all out of narcotics (Narcotics)
All of my bitches exotic (Exotic)
You niggas drinking on Watson (On Watson)
I keep the chopper for plotting (Rah)
I keep the white like cotton (White)
Look at your pot, it's rotten (Rotten)
We're never going in a drought (No)
Junkies coming in and out (Yo)
I used to run in your house (Yo)
Wrapping up you and your spouse (Your spouse)
I used to be sleep on the couch (The couch)
And now I cash out, no amount (Ay)
I pop a Perc and then I'm out (Perc)
I spent two million on a house (two mill)
Run the money up like a route (Run it up)
Sober niggas out of style (Sober)
Cobra niggas get the power (Cobra)
Fifty thousand for the style (fifty thousand)
I'm in the Coupe with no miles
Balling like Darius Miles
If you own the drug Iâ€™m on, you need to pull up right now (Skrt, skrt, skrrrt, woop)
I pop it off, feel like a ghost (I pop it off)
My niggas doing the most (My niggas doing)
I'm never gon' set up my folks (Im never gon')
I got more sand than the coast

[Chorus: Quavo]
I put a mill in the attic
I fell in love with the drugs, I think I'm a addict
Percocet, molly, and Xanax (Molly)
I feel like I land on the planet (Planet)
I'm on Designer drugs, on Designer drugs, on Designer drugs (Desginer)
I'm on Designer drugs, on Designer drugs, on Designer drugs (Designer)
I put a mill in the attic
I fell in love with the drugs, I think I'm a addict
Percocet, molly, and Xanax (Molly)
I feel like I land on the planet
I'm on Designer drugs, on Designer drugs, on Designer drugs (Designer)
I'm on Designer drugs, on Designer drugs, on Designer drugs (Designer)
