[Intro]
A big road is ahead of my feet
A lot of things to say is behind my teeth
I’m a lighter for those who can’t see
Cause what I leave behind becomes me
Unsure, unfocused, I change
But expected to lead the way
I hope they will remember my name
If soon I never see another day

[Chorus]
Oh say, can you see?
My people prayed to take a knee
I’m tryna save the whole world, but it ain’t my job
No, it ain’t my job
In this life, that’s how you tear yourself apart
In this life, that’s how you tear yourself apart
In this life, that’s how you tear yourself apart
In this life, that’s how you tear yourself apart

[Verse 1]
Sometimes I think about my past life
If I lived good, if I acted right
If I sacrificed, if I saved a life
If I stayed up late through the day and night
Tryna fix things, broken on the inside and out
Mask is off and you can see the doubt
I look at my state and it looks the same
So I became a fish with no bones to break
And swam away from every scare I had
Became Huey before I go to class
Tried to find in others the things in myself
That I would hide so they would never know me back
And I became the one that tried to hold me back
Mystery, just like a password
I’m backwards so my first words are my last words

[Chorus]
Oh say, can you see?
My people prayed, so take a knee
I’m tryna save the whole world, but it ain’t my job
No, it ain’t my job
In this life, that’s how you tear yourself apart
In this life, that’s how you tear yourself apart
In this life, that’s how you tear yourself apart
In this life, that’s how you tear yourself apart

[Verse 2]
And sometimes I think about change
If I stayed the same or if I've been different cause
Every decision I’ve made
Has probably been in my best interest
I’ve broken up, I’m not cold enough
I start choking up, I start folding up
But I overcome, the biggest people got the biggest struggles but it’s over done
I’m 0 for 1, maybe 0 for 2, but it’s all for one, and it’s all for you
Even Brew, even me, I improve, I succeed
But I love, and I breathe, from a fish, to a king
Huey, for all that he was
He was just like you and me

[Bridge]
Oh say, can you see?
My people prayed, so take a knee
Some called him evil
He gave his love to the people
I am a flawed individual
I got love for my people
I got love for my people
My ideas is illegal
I been sleeping with some demons that’d be lethal to my equals
I will die the only way I can
And imma keep my secrets like a password
And imma rap my verse in backwards
So my first words are my last words

[Outro]
In this life, that’s how you tear yourself apart
In this life, that’s how you tear yourself apart
In this life, that’s how you tear yourself apart
In this life, that’s how you tear yourself apart
In this life, that’s how you tear yourself apart
In this life, that’s how you tear yourself apart
In this life, that’s how you tear yourself apart
In this life, that’s how you tear yourself apart
(from Baton Rouge to Canada
I don’t think that I’m man enough)

[Outro]
*At 4:10 AM, Huey Long died*
*His last words, “God, don’t let me die.”*
*“I have so much to do."*
