[Intro: Takeoff & Quavo]
All this water on this ice, you know?
It's a different life, I might cop the watch twice
Yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah
If I see what I like (yeah-yeah)
I ask 'em, "What's the price?" (yeah-yeah)
You know, my life, like poltergeist (yeah)

[Chorus: Quavo]
Sing like Mariah (sing)
Too much water, need fire (too much water, need fire)
Yeah, yeah-yeah, yeah
All this water on this ice (all this water on this ice)
All this water on this ice (splash, splash)
No lights (no lights), yeah (yeah)
All this water on this ice (ice, icey)
Make 'em sing like the choir (sing, sing)

[Verse 1: Quavo]
Turn off the lights, let the ice glow (ice)
Tell me the price on the wide load (wide load)
You can lose your life at the night show (night show)
I might call a ISO (ISO)
Eddie Guerrero (yee), frog splash-bowl (yee)
Walls of Jericho on Kurt Angle (yeah)
Wrist look like I play with the Bengals
Hunnid racks in my pouch like a kango (ice)
Get 'em in, get 'em out, that's how the game go (yeah)
All this damn paint and it rained on (huh?)
Need you put this light on this iPhone (yeah)
'Cause I put my life on this microphone (yeah)
Now hold up two cups of that styrofoam (yee)
Now roll up two blunts if you just came home
Now hold up two cups of that styrofoam (whoa)
Now roll up two blunts if you just came home

[Chorus: Quavo]
Sing like Mariah (sing)
Too much water, need fire (too much water, need fire)
Yeah, yeah-yeah, yeah
All this water on this ice (all this water on this ice)
All this water on this ice (splash, splash)
No lights (no lights), yeah (yeah)
All this water on this ice (ice, icey)
Make 'em sing like the choir (sing, sing)

[Verse 2: Takeoff]
All this water on this ice (ice)
All my life I had to fight, had to earn my stripes (stripes)
Diamonds bright and blind at night, ask 'em, "What's the price?" (price)
I'm the one that treat her right, I might change her life (life, yeah)
I put that ice on my neck an' wrist (neck an' wrist)
One thing I won't do is spoil a bitch (spoil a bitch)
Backends on backends, the Forbes' List (Forbes' List)
Ballin' on niggas, no tournament (tournament)
You never been to a Carnage and Migos show
Bitches where they from and they showin' titties (titties)
Drop out the bando with dirty sticks
He got me fucked up, thinkin' we ain't havin' bricks (white)
The name got bigger so we keep the gate
You wanna play, we poppin' shit (brr-rr-rr)
The fame ain't nothin', my nigga
The bag dat way, so we gotta take a trip (dat way)
The days I wanted to fill my wrist up with that glaze
Back to when I had that minimum wage
Now I'm front page an' I get paid
Walk on the stage an' a nigga throw shade

[Chorus: Quavo]
Sing like Mariah (sing)
Too much water, need fire (too much water, need fire)
Yeah, yeah-yeah, yeah
All this water on this ice (all this water on this ice)
All this water on this ice (splash, splash)
No lights (no lights), yeah (yeah)
All this water on this ice (ice, icey)
Make 'em sing like the choir (sing, sing)
