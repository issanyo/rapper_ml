[Intro: Quavo]
Ricky Racks
Dj Durel!
Ay, give 'em hell
Ay, ay
Ay, ay, woo!

[Hook: Quavo]
All my niggas workin'
Trappin', cappin, servin'
Ballin', James Worthy
Geekin' off a perky
Up early, trappin' real early
Cup real dirty, whatcha workin'?
Migos having birdies (brrrr)
I don't know ya, I ain't servin'
Got your main dame slurpin'
All my damn chains bling
Cookie kickin', Liu Kang
Bruce Lee, Tsung Shang
John Wic, John Wayne
Elliot Nick no Johnny Dang
Look at my clique, gang, bang (bang)
Two bitches, one me
They suckin' and fuckin' the same thang

[Verse 1: Quavo]
Pull out the lot
I'm in the drop
I pour a 8, then count up my knots
I bought a Chevy, Chevy T top
Put it on skates, dope boy boss
I'm in the north whippin' the pot
Kick in yo' door then I run through your spot
When I say, "We Migos," They're sayin' we hot
Fuck 12, I'm buckin', they catch me or not
Got bales, I just pulled a U-Haul out
These niggas is pussy, bring Ru Paul out
When I spray the chopper, I'm goin' all out
500 thousand in my dog house
You niggas is rats, I'm callin' you Mighty Mouse
I jugged a cutie when it was a thigh out
I had a nina in Mansion, no Ca$h Out
Pull up the plug, better bring the whole bag out
Feelin' like Flippa, but I gotta stash house
Don't like the Xans, that shit make me pass out
Dunk on a nigga, call me Quavo Stackhouse
She want my money, but I brought a rack out
Heard that you got it so we bring the MAC out
I know it's trouble, John Wic brought the mask out
I touched a fan, and then she passed out
Front and back end, they gon' make you bring cash out

[Hook: Quavo]
All my niggas workin'
Trappin', cappin, servin'
Ballin', James Worthy
Geekin' off of perky
Up early, trappin' real early
Cup real dirty, whatcha workin'?
Migos having birdies (brrrr)
I don't know ya, I ain't servin'
Got your main dame slurpin'
All my damn chains bling
Cookie kickin', Liu Kang
Bruce Lee, Tsung Shang
John Wic, John Wayne
Elliot Nick no Johnny Dang
Look at my clique, gang, bang (bang)
Two bitches, one me
They suckin' and fuckin' the same thang

[Verse 2: John Wic]
I don't know you so you know I'm not servin'
Word on the street that the young nigga workin'
Shock on a baby like I'm James Worthy
Sleep with the stick because I'm feelin' nervous
Convicted felons, they be geeking off perkys
Trigger finger itching, shoot 'em on purpose
Trapping cross the country, havin' no service
Pull up on him at his funeral service (pull up)
Migo gang everything (Migo gang)
Yes I do gang bang (bang)
We are really not the same (no we're not)
Won't miss, perfect aim
Retaliation is a must, some of your partners can't trust
I put the dope in my nuts, when the folks raided the bus
I drop a 4 on my cup
The money it give me a rush
Shootin' out hundred rounds, choppa flippin' yo' truck
Feds taking pictures, like I give a fuck
Give that girl a buck, I bet she gon' suck
When I touch a mill you might as well give up
Ten fade, bullets linin' you up
Hellcat, Forgiato pull up
Lindsay Lohan in the trap cookin' up

[Hook: Quavo]
All my niggas workin'
Trappin', cappin, servin'
Ballin', James Worthy
Geekin' off of perky
Up early, trappin' real early
Cup real dirty, whatcha workin'?
Migos having birdies (brrrr)
I don't know ya, I ain't servin'
Got your main dame slurpin'
All my damn chains bling

Bruce Lee, Tsung Shang
John Wic, John Wayne
Elliot Nick no Johnny Dang
Look at my clique, gang, bang (bang)
Two bitches, one me
They suckin' and fuckin' the same thang

[Verse 3: Takeoff]
Tsung Shang, Liu Kang, same thang (Kang)
Ballman, Balmain, (same thang) same thang
Wrist froze, Elliot A (ice), no Johny Dang
Surfboard, we the wave
Tryna mix the food, I'ma put 'em on a plane
Drinking Act, you drinking the Bombay
Sip a cup, Iâ€™m smoking it to the face
Real street niggas no fade, no case
Hit a lick, put ten up in the safe
Real shit nigga we paved the wave
Own the game, nigga we changed the game
On the Nawf nigga, I made my name
Want the cash nigga, still fuck the fame
I can't change, that's how I came
She look good, but shit she on 'caine
Can't complain 'cause shit I'm on drank
Sleep walking, up, just can't think
Popped a perc, she feel she gon' faint
She can't see, she feel like Ray (Charles)
She like the dab and the feng shui
She told me the dope grade A, pay me!

[Hook: Quavo]
All my niggas workin'
