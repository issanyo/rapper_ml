Say you thirsty, come and get it all right

My two piece's fucking on the first night
That's why she's fuckin' on her first night

Put that D in your lungs, have you speakin' "Your turn"
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Stick in these hoes like you need it, say [?] I be going up on niggas' elevator
Foreign cars, I got foreign bars
Only thing I missing it's an translator
Only thing she wearin' it's a [?]maker
More chick up in the Caddy [?] how your friend visit
You go both handed, hold you down with the shit (oh)

[Verse 3: Jeremih]
They said bitches got stopped, I'm just like my [?]
Pullin' up in my rocket, hoes to blame 'em and they hate on 'em
But there's two C's and it's to y'all when we drivin' now through this universe
I'm just freakin' and hate 'em wrong
That's a good [?] and they trick with us
But this all plenty got your hand
Your best friend slide 'round in the backseat
Kill the pussy, clothes casket
Runnin' in 'em like a track meat
