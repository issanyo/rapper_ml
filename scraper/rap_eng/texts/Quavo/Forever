[Intro: Sebastian Kole]
But this time I want
Forever, forever, forever, yeah

[Pre-Chorus: Sebastian Kole]
Yeah, but this time I want
Forever, forever, forever, yeah
Yeah, but this time we'll last
Forever, forever, forever, yeah

[Chorus: Sebastian Kole & Quavo]
Promise I will stay
I will never leave you
Forever and a day
That's how long we'll be together, yeah
But this time I want
Forever, forever, forever, yeah

[Verse 1: Quavo]
This time, this time, this time, this time
I want it forever (yeah)
This is my time, my time
We cannot settle (woo)
For no nicks and dimes (no)
We wanna live better (better)
Take it to another level (yeah)
Young nigga, trendsetters (ayy)
Boss man, I developed (yeah)
Big house with a safe in it
Had to put away the cheddar (cash)
Prolly couldn't go to Yale
But a young nigga still real clever (clever)

[Chorus: Sebastian Kole]
Forever, forever, forever, yeah

[Verse 2: Sebastian Kole]
I'm not afraid to fail
Maybe I'm scared to fly
Funny how fear of heights
But push you to gettin' high
Money can't buy you love
But it can get you by
Until they say goodbye, yeah, yeah
I'm so used to wakin' up to someone new
I'm so used to breakin' up, I'm breakin' down
I'm so used to pain it makes me comfortable
Learned to hide my sabotage in camouflage

[Pre-Chorus: Sebastian Kole]
Yeah, but this time I want
Forever, forever, forever, yeah
Yeah, but this time we'll last
Forever, forever, forever, yeah

[Chorus: Sebastian Kole & Quavo]
Promise I will stay
I will never leave you
Forever and a day
That's how long we'll be together, yeah
But this time I want
Quavo
Forever, forever, forever, yeah
Yeah, yeah

[Verse 3: Quavo]
I done paid all my dues to break the rules (I done paid)
I done made it out the hood, they look like fools (look like fools, yeah)
I ain't ever tried to fit in to be cool (hell nah)
I just want this shit forever, what I do (yeah, yeah)
That's why I bought my mom her favorite pair of shoes (mama!)
I promise I'ma put my nieces all through school (my nieces)
Can't no man treat my ladies like I do (nope)
And if they pull up, they gon' have to fill these shoes, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Chorus: Sebastian Kole]
Sigma's got it
We've got it, oh boy
Forever, forever, forever, yeah
Sigma's got it
We've got it, oh boy
Forever, forever, forever, yeah
