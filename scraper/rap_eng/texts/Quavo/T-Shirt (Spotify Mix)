Young nigga poppin', cookie kickin' karate (cookie!)
Bout to get that lamb til' I thought about that rari (skrr skrr!)
Ain't no doubt about it I'm yo favorite rapper artist
When you pull out that Draco make sure ain't nobody watching

Migos we the topic (Hey!), pockets extra sloppy (slop!)
On Spotify they listenin' they can't wait til' we droppin'
Like my women cocky, (women!) drape em' in Versace ('sace!)
Fish scale wallets, Christopher Wallace (white!)
Spotify hit me, told me "Pull Up," said "I got em'"
Number one no problem, try to stop we droppin'
Culture out there, dropped it, told em, "Hit me" when they cop it
Visuals on North Pole, ain't no photo shoppin'
Back then when I wasn't poppin', y'all people told me stop it

Thinkin' bout money when I say cottage, so much can't fit in my wallet
Yeah, yeah I might give my fans all my clothes yeah, yeah
