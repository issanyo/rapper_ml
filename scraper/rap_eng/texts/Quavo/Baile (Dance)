[Intro: Quavo & Evander Griiim]
Whoa-oh, DJ Durel
A toda' las cultura'
The real culture
Straight up

[Chorus: Quavo & Evander Griiim]
Dance with that stick like I live in the trap (hey)
She dance on that dick like she walk down the catwalk
I just want the cash, you can save all the back talk
Just dance (hey)
After this day we on, ain't no day off (no way, no)
Last gang standin' like the playoffs (let's play)
I can't sit right there and let these niggas play y'all (no way, no, no)
It's okay, we ball (okay)

[Interlude: Quavo]
You know what I'm sayin', yeah
Ayy, DJ Durel, I ain't really wanna do it to 'em
I ain't really wanna give 'em all the game
I wanna let my- let my young niggas get 'em
You know what I mean (go)
Go get 'em
Go

[Verse 1: Evander Griiim]
Baila mi gente (baila)
Me gusta chiquita chingona
A nigga just threw a whole SunTrust
My diamonds they dancin' like samba
Tirame el culo arriba
She's callin' me chulo, I need that
Me gusta chiquita chingona
Me gusta chiquita chingona
Shawty a sauna, Shakira mixed with Rihanna (yeah, yeah)
Baby come over
Dance, dance on my cama
Shawty keep dancin'
I'll keep throwin' them commas
Cuenta t√∫ hombre', que el negro sabe Spanish

[Chorus: Quavo & Evander Griiim]
Dance with that stick like I live in the trap (hey)
She dance on that dick like she walk down the catwalk
I just want the cash, you can save all the back talk
Just dance (hey)
After this day we on, ain't no day off (no way, no)
Last gang standin' like the playoffs (let's play)
I can't sit right there and let these niggas play y'all (no way, no, no)
It's okay, we ball (okay)

[Verse 2: Quavo & Evander Griiim]
Big dog come through (big dog, woof)
Don't put 'em in a bad move (what he gon' do)
Chop bricks like Kung Fu (bricks, bricks)
Then sell it like fast food (yeah, yeah)
Bitch don't act new (nowhere near)
Nigga know cash rules (nigga know cash)
Your ice ain't brand new (ice, ice)
Nigga know when shit fool (hey, hey, hey, go)
Meteme la pela
Todo soltera, ella le gusta el caramelo
Just put a hundred in a Saint Laurent jacket
Cinco mil pesos lo tiro en tu cara
Porque me da pela, nigga me da pela
You a vendetta, dale don dale
Tienes muy suave, tirame los llaves
Chinga tu madre, movin' nar', movin' nar', movin' narcotics
Baila mi gente, me gusta chiquitas chingonas
Baila mi gente, me gusta Cubanas nalgonas
Baila mi gente, me gusta chiquitas fregonas
Baila mi gente, baile mi, baile mi gente

[Chorus: Quavo & Evander Griiim]
Dance with that stick like I live in the trap (hey)
She dance on that dick like she walk down the catwalk
