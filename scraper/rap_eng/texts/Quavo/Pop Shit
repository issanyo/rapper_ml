[Intro: Takeoff]
Ayy

Ayy, you know who done fucked up right, you
Uh

Yo, you too nigga

Let me pop my shit, yeah you too nigga
Backends we get, pop it
8-8-808 Mafia
Your ho been hit
Oh you talkin' 'bout your bitch?
The wrist been lit (ice)
Live like this
Nah for real nigga

[Verse 1: Takeoff]
Hundred K spent on my wrist lil nigga
Breakin' that pot and that dope gon' triple
I left a tip for your bitch my nigga
I fuck her mouth, her throat got bigger
Pull up and hop out the car, drip
Fuck on a bitch, she a star, drip
Buy it and fuck what it cost, drip
Try it and get knocked off, brrt
They gon' eat the dab up, Jaws
Never shop, crib came with a mall
Free my niggas that's behind the wall
Ain't gon' stop till they free my niggas all
I can make a movie, Seagal
No dribble, I ball
And roll up a Backwood with Cookie as fat as a log
Then hop in the frog
I'ma go'n pop my shit
I'ma pull up at six
Number one, first draft pick
Coupe, it came with the kit
Real niggas all around me
Lot of pussy niggas still exist
Draco right under my trench
Starter bitches on my bench
The cookie pack came dense

[Chorus: Takeoff]
Pop shit, pop shit, pop shit, pop shit
Pop shit, pop shit, pop shit (pop)
Pop shit, pop-pop-pop shit
Pop shit, pop shit, pop shit, pop shit (pop)
Pop shit, pop shit, pop shit, pop shit
Pop shit, pop shit, pop shit (pop)
Pop shit, pop-pop-pop shit
Pop shit, pop shit, pop shit, pop shit (pop)

[Post-Chorus: Takeoff]
I'ma gon' to pop my shit
Hold on, let me talk my shit
Tell her don't look my way
Nigga, I'll buy your bitch
No wings attached
You don't get fly like this
No strings attached
I'ma pop my shit

[Verse 2: Offset]
Don't be poppin', get caught with the sawed-off (poppin')
Whippin' cocaine, cookin' product (coke)
Break down the dope like it's sawdust (break down)
Look what the grind done bought us (look)
Catch the bitches (catch), but I don't fetch the bitches (no)
Catch your bitch, I ain't hit her, I was thinkin' about your feelings (here you go)
I'ma glide on your bitch, do you hear me? (glide)
Shooter on the bench and pop wheelies (brrt)
QC nigga, pop millions (woo)
We ain't gonna talk about the feelings (nah)
We ain't gotta talk about the gremlins (nah)
Paid shooters 'round me chillin' (baow)
Pop it off baby, start kneeling (pop it off)
Give me my racks off the dribble (racks)
My papa pull up in a lizard (pull up)
The eyes on that bitch like a gizzard (eyes)
I get the money so vivid (racks)
Young nigga I'm makin history (history)
Set not going for dissing (nah)
On a jet when I'm flying the distance (jet)
Bad bitch she an assistant (bitch)
Drive the bricks to Michigan (woo)

[Chorus: Takeoff]
Pop shit, pop shit, pop shit, pop shit
Pop shit, pop shit, pop shit (pop)
Pop shit, pop-pop-pop shit
Pop shit, pop shit, pop shit, pop shit (pop)
Pop shit, pop shit, pop shit, pop shit
Pop shit, pop shit, pop shit (pop)
Pop shit, pop-pop-pop shit
Pop shit, pop shit, pop shit, pop shit (pop)

[Post-Chorus: Takeoff]
I'ma gon' to pop my shit
Hold on, let me talk my shit
Tell her don't look my way
Nigga, I'll buy your bitch
No wings attached
You don't get fly like this
No strings attached

[Verse 3: Quavo]
Pop my shit, I pop it (pop it)
Whole lotta bullets in the cartridge
Told 'em, trust the process (trust it)
I'ma break em down, diagnostics (break it)
Cup of the drank too toxic (woo)
Stashin' the pint in the cockpit (stashin')
Your bitch want my kids, she swallowed it (uhh)
Came back up for oxygen (up)
FN make a nigga move (move, move)
Put a fuck nigga on the news (news, news)
Mama drunk, let you drank booze (mama)
'Cause her son done turned into food (damn)
Big name came with the weight (woo)
Rear cam all in the plates (yeah)
Mix it in dog food, baked (skrt)
Finesse me a nigga out of state (jugg)
You turned to a woman, Cait (Jenner)
Crisp back the lawn, mow the snakes (renter)
Stick to the money, pace (stuck)
Hit the gas to the top, it's a race (top)
My wrist, can't stop, Ma$e (woo)
Give a bitch my cock, the taste (here)
Got a M in the locked suitcase (cash)
Mama found it when she broke the vase (damn ma)

[Chorus: Takeoff]
Pop shit, pop shit, pop shit, pop shit
Pop shit, pop shit, pop shit (pop)
Pop shit, pop-pop-pop shit
Pop shit, pop shit, pop shit, pop shit (pop)
