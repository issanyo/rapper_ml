[Chorus]
Migos! (Migos, Migos, Migos...)
Ou! (Ou, ou, ou...)
I had to play this shit off
I wanted to make you my life
I knew from that day
On everything that nothing you say could ever change my mind (no!)
I have to play this shit off
Officially you're not mine
I know that he know 'bout everything
But nothing you say could ever change my mind (nah)

[Post-Chorus]
Change my mind (Change my mind, change my mind)
Put that on everything (Put that on everything)
Change my mind (Change...)
Put that on everything (Put that on everything)
Nothing gonna change my mind (Nothing gonna change my mind)

[Verse 1 - Avery Wilson]
Is that you not getting enough love? (Cause I do)
Cause it's taking everything for me not to come over
Tell you you're the one I want (You're the one that i really want)
Girl, I want you to recognize fire (recognize fire)
Baby, you got that sauce
Every nigga in here tryna get at what I want (tryna get at what I want... now for real)

[Pre-Chorus]
But I'll lay everybody down in here if I have to win your life
No more, you don't have to pretend
You can go and let me rescue you
My heart took a funny leap as you walked in here
Not a damn thing he can do
But be clear, if we both leave here
You're the first thing I'm gon' do

[Chorus]
I had to play this shit off
I wanted to make you my life
I knew from that day
On everything that nothing you say could ever change my mind
I have to play this shit off
Officially you're not mine
I know that he know 'bout everything
But nothing you say could ever change my mind

[Verse 2 - Quavo]
Change my mind
Lil mama a dime
There's nothing that you can do to change my mind
Lil mama a dime
There's nothing that you can do to change my mind
Change my mind
Lil mama a dime
There's nothing that you can do to change my mind
Time is money and money is time
She's standing right next to her man in disguise
She looking at me out the corner her eye
She walking away from you, wondering why
After the club, had to give her a ride
I beat it, she give me brain, call her DeVry

[Verse 3]
Pull up to the mall I hop out with my Migos 'nem
I'm walking in the store to go cop me some Yung Rich Nation gear
Looking for some dimes, I just found me a Kim Kardashian
I got to get her, nobody can stop me because I'm passionate
I walked up, introduced myself
Told her my name is Takeoff
Told her 'bout my mansion, and asked her come pull up at my lake house
Told me that she not single, her nigga work in Foot Locker
Slipped me her number
Told me pull up, make her scream like the opera

[Chorus]
I had to play this shit off
I wanted to make you my life
I knew from that day
On everything that nothing you say could ever change my mind
I have to play this shit off
Officially you're not mine
I know that he know 'bout everything
But nothing you say could ever change my mind
Change my mind, change, change my mind

[Verse 3 - Avery Wilson]
Put that on everything, change
If I pull that weapon on you (that weapon on you)
Is it fit for me to come confess up
I've been told a couple times that I'm damn rude boy (damn rude boy, now for real)
You know your body raging that fire (raging that fire)
Girl, they got you in the cop car
I'mma do my damn best to break that lock (break that lock)

[Pre-Chorus]
But I'll lay everybody down in here if I have to win your life
No more, you don't have to pretend
You can go and let me rescue you
My heart took a funny leap as you walked in here
Not a damn thing he can do (damn, damn)
But be clear, if we both leave here
You're the first thing I'm gon' do

[Chorus]
I had to play this shit off
I wanted to make you my life
I knew from that day
On everything that nothing you say could ever change my mind (No!)
I have to play this shit off
Officially you're not mine
I know that he know 'bout everything
But nothing you say could ever change my mind
Change my mind, change my mind...
Put that on everything
Put that on everything
