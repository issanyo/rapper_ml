Check, check
Check, hol' up, hol' up, 1-2, 1 motherfuckin' 2
Check, Keke, check

[Chorus: Keke Palmer]
When I see when I wanna, I get down on 'er
See when I wanna, I get down on 'er
See when I wanna, I get down on 'er
See when I wanna, I get down on 'er (Keke)
Wind up, wind up, tell 'em old bitches
Line up, li-line up
'Fore I put her in the grinder, grinder (Keke)
All my boss bitches wind up, wind up

[Verse 1: Keke Palmer]
I don't pull up, Uber came to get me
Flash bulbs everywhere, paparazzi sic me
I guess I owe everythin' home to my viddy
Pardon me if my eyes kinda low, I can't see ya
So tell 'em stop bitching, and motherfucker listen
Since 9 years old, I been in the kitchen
Family gotta eat (eat), that mean I gotta get that cake
And I ain't sittin' down for no nigga, feel me

[Pre-Chorus: Keke Palmer]
All the way to California in the caravan
It was me and my mama, my motherfuckin' fam
From the gutter, gutter
So you mad 'cause I came up, came up, bitches

[Chorus: Keke Palmer]
When I see when I wanna, I get down on 'er
See when I wanna, I get down on 'er
See when I wanna, I get down on 'er
See when I wanna, I get down on 'er (Keke)
Wind up, wind up, tell 'em old bitches
Line up, li-line up
'Fore I put her in the grinder, grinder (Keke)
All my boss bitches wind up, wind up

[Verse 2: Quavo]
Quavo tune it, I got grind ya (grind ya)

But she know it's poppin'

You think that I won't put it on the line, yeah, I doubt it

'Fore I put her in the grinder, grinder (Keke)
All my boss bitches wind up, wind up

[Verse 3: Quavo]
Then she say I can't handle it (huh)
Took her to the room and mounted it (smash)
She havin' relationship goals (huh)
Money and fame, I balanced it (woah)
We livin' in mansions and palaces (uh)
She love my trap analysis (ayy)
Her pussy so wet, need a towel (splash)
Her pussy watercolor fountain
Get that bag now
Plus I heard she workin' (workin')
Get that, get that bag now
It better be that Birkin (Birkin)
Ain't know for certain (certain)
Ain't know your purses (purses)
Is she worth it?
Is it worth it? (Worth it)
I'm James Worthy (Worthy)

Taste like ice cream (ice cream)
Her flavor sherbet (sherbet)
Put that money on lil' baby

[Chorus: Keke Palmer]
When I see when I wanna, I get down on 'er
See when I wanna, I get down on 'er
See when I wanna, I get down on 'er

Wind up, wind up, tell 'em old bitches
Line up, li-line up
'Fore I put her in the grinder, grinder (Keke)
All my boss bitches wind up, wind up
