[Intro: Young Thug]
Gator bump, they ain't swag, though
Backburner full of fine hoes
Swag journies to the condo
Couple milli' off a ride, woah

[Chorus: Quavo]
Re-up on the bag (re-up), then I walk on the red carpet (hey)
Anything I see, I'm snatchin' (woo)
I'm geeked, I see iCarly (geeked)
Upscale fashion (yeah), on the carpet more than Aladdin (yeah)
Park it at Magic (yeah)
Whippin' up, whippin' up magic (skrrt, skrrt)

[Verse 1: Quavo]
Two hoes, classy (two)
But they gon' still get nasty (two)
Wrap it in plastic (hoo)
Jayhawks landing in Kansas (brr, brr)
This that Wraith talk (Wraith)
Mil talk, all in the safe talk (safe)
Ain't worried 'bout them nigga, introduce 'em to K talk (K)
Go get the bag on a day off (racks)
Go get the rings out the playoffs (rings)
Pots in the beat, it's a bake-off (packs)
Fuck on her, then she get laid off (smash)
Big boy tools, Maaco (big boy)
Make a bitch dance with a Draco (dance)
Walkin' with the cheese, that queso (cheese)

Private jet, we don't do layover (whew)
One call, I'm havin' your bae over (brrt)
Walk out the spot with the makeover (woo)
Got her addicted to payola (addicted)

[Chorus: Quavo]
Re-up on the bag (re-up), then I walk on the red carpet (hey)
Anything I see, I'm snatchin' (woo)
I'm geeked, I see iCarly (geeked)
Upscale fashion (yeah), on the carpet more than Aladdin (yeah)

[Verse 3: Future]
More smoke than puff
Bitch thick like buff
An' I'm straight out the slum with the yayo (strong)
Snap on this shit like I'm Fabo (skrrt)
We got squares and bales in Clayco
All my money and cars biracial
I can't count up the stars, they head-top
Soon I sit in that foreign, my leg cop
I bought a straight [?] with the crack rock (ya)
Hit a lick then I wanna cop the Maybach (ya)
I [?] was a dope-boy (dope-boy)
Never save a hoe like a lifeguard
An' I got the Molly by the Eightball (yeah)
I get the bag on a day-day
I fucked the bitch on the Adderall (Adderall)
I put her up in my catalog
Soon as I came on the car lot, started fishtailing (skrrt)
Yeah, shawty gon' squirt it then spit it out back, Israeli
Yeah, shawty gon' bus' on the head first, no paramedics
Yeah, all I wanted, all I wanted was a hunnid mil
An' I'm there already

[Verse 4: Young Thug]
Go get the bag on a day off (day off)
Make her suck dick â€™til her face sore
I feel this aspirin like Rentanol
I got this shit out the bando (yeah)
I'm in the coupe with like nine hoes (nine hoes)
You better believe that they fine hoes (fine hoes)
I'm drippin' sauce with my eyes closed
Turned to a horse, I was riding hoes
Gator bump, they ain't swag, though
Backburner full of fine hoes
Swag journies to the condo
Couple milli' off a ride, woah
