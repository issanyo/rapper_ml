[Intro]
Dun Deal on the track

[Verse 1]
Is you with me or against me? (With me or against me?)
I'm a OG now, so you need me (OG, I'm a OG)
Think you poppin' Xanax bars, but it's Fentanyl
(No-no bars, it's Fentanyl)
Think you're living life like rockstars but you're dead now (Yeah)
Let me put you under my wing, I can teach you one thing (Let me put you under my wing)
Let me put you under my wing, I can show you it ain't all about a chain (Ayy, ayy)

[Chorus]
I'ma be your big bro (Big bro), I'ma be your big bro (Big bro)
I'ma be your big bro (Big bro), I'ma be your big bro (Big bro)
I'ma be your big bro (Big bro), say we all need a big bro (All need a big bro)
All need a big bro (All need a big bro), I'ma be your big bro (Yeah)

[Verse 2]
Show you how to get a ring on that championship team
When you get a ring, it's a championship
Teach 'em how to get them Ps on the back of RVs
When you get 'cross seas, it's a championship
Clappin' on things like I'm in New Orleans
When I hit 'em hard I be striking them
Calling all gangs 'cause I'm right with them
You too young to be hanging out all night with them

[Refrain]
Brrrrrrr (Ahh)
Tsh, it's a young nigga calling my phone (Ahh)
What's happening?
Hey big bro, them niggas just got me for my chain (Ahh)
What?
Them niggas just set me up big brother
They just got me for my chain (Ahh)
Aw man (Ahh)
Damn (Ahh)
Ay, ay, calm down, calm down, we gon' get it back (Ahh)
Just pull up on me, tell me what happened (Ahh)

[Verse 3]
Big bro ridin' with the tool tight (Big bro)
Big bro straight, he live the cool life (Big bro)
Been through the struggle played the rules right (Big bro)
Ain't got nothing to prove, big bro got nine stripes (Big bro)
You out here tryna live your broke life (You, you, ayy)
You out here tryna live that GOAT life (You, you, ayy)
You gonna fuck around, take your life (You, you)
Instagram and guns just don't go right (No, no, ayy)

[Chorus]
I'ma be your big bro (Big bro), I'ma be your big bro (Big bro)
I'ma be your big bro (Big bro), I'ma be your big bro (Big bro)
I'ma be your big bro (Big bro), say we all need a big bro (All need a big bro)
All need a big bro (All need a big bro), I'ma be your big bro (Yeah)
