[Hook: Quavo]
Young nigga hit the pot
Young nigga hit the block
Young nigga hit the spot
Young nigga hit the trap
Young nigga scrape the pot
Young nigga hit the block
Young nigga flex your knot
Young nigga pull out your Glock

[Verse 1: Quavo]
Young nigga flexin
I was in DC, I had to squabble for my necklace
You win some, you lose some, like Friday
But every Friday is a payday
Mayday, don’t let you think this nigga Debo
I can get ‘em for the kilo
Call up Skippa Da Flippa
Abrakadabra, dismiss you
Lil Durk pull up in the vert
Pop the trunk and it’s white like some tissue

[Hook: Quavo]
Young nigga hit the pot
Young nigga hit the block
Young nigga hit the spot
Young nigga hit the trap
Young nigga scrape the pot
Young nigga hit the block
Young nigga flex your knot
Young nigga pull out your Glock

[Verse 2: Skippa Da Flippa]
So many pints like a Houston Texan
Pull out my cash ‘cause I love to flex it
Cappin’ in Washington like I’m a Redskin
30’s and 40’s, I keep Smith & Wesson’s
Nickel and diming when I trap the block
Got 22 in my shooter, work in my crotch
So many hundreds, the counting don’t stop
When I made it like [?] god in the pot
Made a milly in my Jeep
Hollows in your head, they play hide and seek
Crip out of water, you think Dawson’s Creek
50 cal make you run like a trainee
This for the trappers that’s true to the streets
You are what you eat so the beef is on me
You catch the whole loaf nigga if you try me
Just calm down and just leave the flipping to me

[Hook: Quavo]
Young nigga hit the pot
Young nigga hit the block
Young nigga hit the spot
Young nigga hit the trap
Young nigga scrape the pot
Young nigga hit the block
Young nigga flex your knot
Young nigga pull out your Glock

[Verse 3: Lil Durk]
3 4 guns came back to back
Semi-automatic, ave attack
I want the K out the alphabet
You ain’t ever seen shooters in a soccer van?
Talking late night I was on that block
Niggas hatin’ on me, I tote that Glock
Ain’t tryna be like anyone
I know a lot of niggas like Travis $cott
Straight up
You ain’t no killer, straight up
You is a bitch, straight up
Niggas always lying
It’s the guys, ain’t ever straight up
Late night time, wait up
Fifty guys, I’ma weigh it up
Lil nigga get your weight up
Know the whole city hate us
But we gang

[Hook: Quavo]
Young nigga hit the pot
Young nigga hit the block
Young nigga hit the spot

Young nigga scrape the pot
Young nigga hit the block
Young nigga flex your knot
Young nigga pull out your Glock
