[Hook: Jose Guapo]
All this money on me, I feel like Floyd (too much money)
I got too much money on me, they can’t ignore me (too much money)
Look at all this money on me, my appearance they know of it
These strippers they gon dance for it, and I’ma throw it
She gon' shake her ass for the money
I be living fast for the money
ATL ATL ATL, nigga taking chances for the money
Still hustle hard for the money
Nigga can’t starve for the money
Nigga fuck being broke, nigga fuck being broke
Can’t run out of money

[Verse 1: Jose Guapo]
Nigga fuck a money counter, nigga fuck ten counter
I count it by myself
Nigga fuck being broke, nigga it’s young Guapo
I’m handsome and wealthy
We do not check the forecast, but we changing the weather
Designer umbrellas, put some more ice in the bezel
If you’re sweet, we’ll finesse you
Money on money, no pressure
Pull up in compressors (foreign)
And we Burberry our sweaters
Bitch bad, still a nat nat
Guapo he dealt like a crack sack
Nigga fucking up they wrist, those are the niggas we laugh at
Fuck up my set get it right back, throw up the money, they like that
Diamonds been bird, that’s fight night

Undefeated like Mayweather, pop more shit then AB
Damn look at your wrist [?], is that a Rolex or AP?

[Verse 2: Quavo]
She taking her chance for the paper, she fell in love with my money
Fall off in the booth, the club I pull up with a truck load of money
I’m seeing my nigga with choppas, know that they getting into something
Then we hit the runway on a PJ, call the country
Migo gang, OG, head huncho
You can catch me in the street [?] with Longway and young Guapo
What nigga you know on the North side made a quarter mil in a goddamn bando
Young trap spot nigga, fucking with the migos have your block hot nigga
You ain’t never seen a lot of red dots on your bottom looking like a pack of cortisone
That’s young homie the reason, my niggas come get you and it’s murder season
Yeah she working for me, remixing for me
Yeah she cooking for me, all this money for me
Her name is Alicia, her boss got the key

[Verse 2: Offset]
Do anything just to get to the cash
Mama said I’m gonna give her a heart attack
Bitches ain’t shit, they be fucking no cuffing
She suck me I’m skeeting all over her eyelash
You not from my hood so you don’t get a pass
I’m on the highway, 50 bricks on the bypass
Cook up a brick, break down a brick
Coca on my knuckles looking like ash
Hopping out the Bentley, fucking with the chickens
Throw the money in the air, you got it, ain’t no tricking
Talking bout you got that money nigga, know you fiction
Broke and these niggas keep talking but I ain’t gon listen
Throw the money on the bitches, I done paid tuition
All of my niggas, we migos but we don’t wear dickeys
All of my clothes are exquisite, all of my bitches long distance
Minajing these bitches, no Nicki
Versace my lenses like Biggie
Pussy boy nigga a sissy
Throwing the money like Frisbees
Fuck you talking, fuck nigga I’m strapped
Your bitch keep on staring, your bitch gon get kidnapped
In the club, Offset keep throwing the racks
Money all over the floor to my kneecaps
