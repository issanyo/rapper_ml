[Intro: Quavo]
'Know whatchua'll doin?
But I'm piped up
See that boy right there?
He piped up
See that girl right there?
She piped up

[Hook x2: Quavo]
Pipe it up, pipe it up, pipe it up, pipe it up
Pipe it up, pipe it up, pipe it up, pipe it up
I walk in the club just to pipe it up
I stand on this stage and I pipe it up
Get a regular ho tell her pipe it up
Go buy a bando then I pipe it up

[Verse 1: 2 Chainz]
Mike take some money and throw it
Might take your bitch and ignore her
I go to the club in Balenciagas, I fuck your bitch in some Jordans
Turn the hotel to the titty bar, get there drunk at the mini bar
I just bought a line of Actavis, I just pay like 300 for it
Alright I'ma focus on the pipe, my bro was on the white I will make him play, Rodney White
I will make him play, Julio, my trap pow where the studio
Process of elimination, this a real nigga invitation
This a real bitch conversation, drop the top for some ventilation
Yeah, my flow is hotter than an inmate on the conjugal visit
Tuggin' and kissin', one of these hoes ain't seen in a minute
I'm smokin' weed in the Emmys, I pop a pill in the Grammys
I be a live in Miami, just like I live in Miami

[Hook x2: Quavo]
Pipe it up, pipe it up, pipe it up, pipe it up
Pipe it up, pipe it up, pipe it up, pipe it up
I walk in the club just to pipe it up
I stand on this stage and I pipe it up
Get a regular ho tell her pipe it up
Go buy a bando then I pipe it up

[Verse 2: Jeezy]
Look, pipe that bitch up
Them bottles they light up my section
Just look at these haters (what they doin'?)
They lookin' off in my direction
Movin' my hood, bitch, I've been a boss
Weigh up the 9, said Aninia Ross
Buss' it up, cook it up, get it off
What you do with the rest, that's so and salt
They play with the sack, they gon' get the pipe
Then they gon' pull up and hit the lights
Hop out that bitch like I'm doughboy
125, that's a 4 boy
You piped up, then I piped her down
I'ma lil' wet, but, she gon' wipe me down
Ballin' like Birde above the rim
I rolled down the top like sun slip
I made the team, nigga, fuck the coach
Them niggas you made man you hate the most
Jack got 'em in, they fresh off the boat
Saw 2 of them bitches then bought a rope
Bentley GT doing drive-bys
Pocket G4 doing fly-bys
Church in these streets
Ya'll best tighten up
How much you drop when you pipe it up?

[Hook x2: Quavo]
Pipe it up (x8)
I walk in the club just to pipe it up
I stand on this stage and I pipe it up
Get a regular ho tell her pipe it up
Go buy a bando then I pipe it up

[Verse 3: Quavo]
Quavo!
Pipe it up, pipe it up, pipe it up (Pipe it up, pipe it up, pipe it up)
I walk in the club just to pipe it up
She was a basic bitch til I piped her up
I'm just doing my dab, I called it the pipe it up
They know that I'm having blue Benjamin's
They know I'm on top of the pyramid
They know I'ma go down in Guinness
All this dab a nigga drippin'
Piped up in the city
Piped up with yo bitches
Piped up in Givenchy
Piped up new edition
When a nigga start talking shit, gotta pipe up the ammunition
Your bitch walkin' around piped up
When she see me, she blowin' kisses
Feelin' like Aladdin, Quavo the genie
I grant your ho three wishes
You know I do magic, Quavo Houdini
I touch the pack and get it missin'

[Verse 4: Takeoff]
Broke niggas still saying "turn it up!"
All my young rich niggas screaming out "pipe it up!"
Benjamins old they extinct like a dinosaur
Look at yo diamonds, yo diamonds ain't bright enough
I send the work to get used in a catapult
Play with the dope in the snow like a hockey puck
Pipe it up, pipe it up, no Roddy Piper
They biting the flow nigga but the Migos got the title
So now niggas dabbing, don't know how it happen
I been touchdown on you niggas ask Madden
Don't forget bitch I'm the dab daddy
In stores now YRN fashion (Yung Rich Nation!)
Pipe it up, bitch it's gon' be the new anthem
I come through swervin in a black Panamera
Pull out the camo when you see me Christian Louboutin, hopping out that's an animal
Now remember, fore we made this song, nobody said pipe it up
Next thing we dropping, we gon' fuck em up, have everybody screaming pipe it up
Pipe it up in the club while I'm on drugs
A nigga fucking up the furniture
Shoot a money ball like Steve Kerr
Pipe it up, I get them pints on reserve (Actavis)

[Hook x2: Quavo]
Pipe it up, pipe it up, pipe it up, pipe it up
Pipe it up, pipe it up, pipe it up, pipe it up
I walk in the club just to pipe it up
I stand on this stage and I pipe it up
Get a regular ho tell her pipe it up
Go buy a bando then I pipe it up
