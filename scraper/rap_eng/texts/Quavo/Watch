(Hook by Quavo)
Watch how I walk
Water, It drip off my jewelry
Watch how I talk
Dollas it ain't nothing new to me
Watch how I walk
Water, It drip off my jewelry
Pocket got so many blues in it
Pull em out and shawty started losing it
Watch how I walk
Water, It drip off my jewelry
Watch how I talk
Dollas it ain't nothing new to me
Watch how I walk
Water, It drip off my jewelry
Pocket got so many blues in it
Pull em out and shawty started losing it

(Verse One by Kevin Gleason)
Watch me as I'm changing what I'm doing
Y'all can tell the difference in my music
Back when they said that they all knew it
They was wrong cuz they thought I blew it
But I ain't blowin shit, I'm on fire
Little kids looking up to me admired
Several labels calling me wanting to hire
I'm glowing, keep on getting higher
Ohh, what a feeling
Making money, and no not from dealing
I'm grinding, showing my true potential
Doing good in school not to mention
Cuz I've changed, I'm paying attention
So before yall talk, just stop, watch, and listen!
Yeah, this is a whole new edition
Music's my only addiction
Cuz this my decision, I wanted to raise the knotch
Watch me grind, yeah baby, just watch!!
Woah!!

(Verse Two by Kevin Gleason)
Watch, watch, watch, watch, watch. Yeah
All I ever heard was Kevin stop! Yeah
But I always said no I'm not
They all said this couldn't be a job
Cuz I'm doing everything they said I couldn't
I put in 10 times the work they put it
I said I was gonna shine, they said no I wouldn't
But they hatin, they just wish they would've
Peace, peace is what I got to say
Years ago I would've quit when they said I had no way
People sayin hateful shit in the school hallways
But watch, watch, watch as I'm just doing my way
Yeah!
