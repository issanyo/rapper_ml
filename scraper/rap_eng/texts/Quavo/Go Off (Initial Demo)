[Chorus]
One more ride (ride), one more race (yeah)
We go all out, we don't play (woo)
One more fight, one more take (ayy)
We won't slow down, ain't no breaks (zoom, zoom)
I'ma go off, out my way (go off)
It don't matter what we face (no)
I'ma go off, out my way (go off)
I'm the master of my fate (yeah)
I'ma go off (yeah), I'ma go off (yeah-yeah)
Here we go now

[Verse]
Takin' off and I'm landin' on the down move (zoom)
To the group, hell nah, I ain't got no rooms (zoom)
When I ride, ride 'round, yeah, I gotta swerve (skrrt)
Race me to the finish line, is you nervous?
Purpose, work for, earn it, yeah
I earned it, designer shoes on the pedal when I curve it (yeah)
Fly by like a birdie, fly by like [?] (skrrt)
Thank you for your service (ayy), I hope what I did was worth it

[Chorus]
One more ride (ride), one more race (yeah)
We go all out, we don't play (woo)
One more fight, one more take (ayy)
We won't slow down, ain't no breaks (zoom, zoom)
I'ma go off, out my way (go off)
It don't matter what we face (no)
I'ma go off, out my way (go off)
I'm the master of my fate (yeah)
I'ma go off (yeah), I'ma go off (yeah-yeah)
Here we go now

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
One more ride (ride), one more race (yeah)
We go all out, we don't play (woo)
One more fight, one more take (ayy)
We won't slow down, ain't no breaks (zoom, zoom)
I'ma go off, out my way (go off)
It don't matter what we face (no)
I'ma go off, out my way (go off)
I'm the master of my fate (yeah)
I'ma go off (yeah), I'ma go off (yeah-yeah)
Here we go now
