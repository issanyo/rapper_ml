[Verse 1: Skippa Da Flippa]
Hell is you doing, chopping the fishes, they fluent
Migo the fam, QC the label
You should follow my movement
You staring and looking like you looking coolest
Hell is you doing?
Do a dropoff, I guess you brought a [?] in
Hell is you doing?
Hell is you doing, hell is you doing
Hell is you doing? I just kicked the dope for a hundred bands up in Munich
You know that your bitch she sucking my dick and it's soothing
Which one is you choosing?
I met her at Newmans, don't get no confusing
She swallowed my semen in Niemen’s
Then tried try to kiss me, bitch hell is you doing?
Newport and Lewis, saw my friend Lucas
50 bands pay for the hitman
Hit em with the cool and you flew to Saint Louis

[Hook: Skippa da Flippa]
Hell is you doing, hell is you doing
What the hell is you doing?
Hell is you doing, hell is you doing
What the hell you doing?

[Hook: Skippa da Flippa]
Hell is you doing, hell is you doing
What the hell is you doing?
Hell is you doing, hell is you doing

[Verse 2: Quavo]
Hell is you doing, 33 bricks like I am Patrick Ewing
I'm taking the pot, I finger fuck it and my wrist it be screwing
Baow, Baow, Baow, Hrah, fuck nigga hell is you doing?
Bitch nigga don’t move or your life, you’ll lose
I’ll turn your body into fucking fluid
My trap got insurance, [?]
When I hit the block, bet I rule it
Hell is you do nigga cool it
Call up my nigga, he’ll hit you with the ruler
Quavo [?] in Saint Louis
Hit a nigga with a bat like a Cardinal
Money, pounds, and ammunition in a nigga’s arsenal
Young niggas remarkable
Chop it up with Migo Carlos
Talking bout numbers like barcodes
We talking in person bout brick fare
No label coming in on truck loads
You an impostor like Gusto
Get out my face, might be homo

[Hook: Skippa da Flippa]
Hell is you doing, hell is you doing
What the hell is you doing?
Hell is you doing, hell is you doing
What the hell you doing?

[Hook: Skippa da Flippa]
Hell is you doing, hell is you doing
What the hell is you doing?
Hell is you doing, hell is you doing
