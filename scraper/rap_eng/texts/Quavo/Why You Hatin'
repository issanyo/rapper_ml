[Intro: Devin Hill]

Real shit, niggas be on that bullshit

[Hook: Devin Hill]
Aye why you hatin' on that nigga? You don't know that nigga

Get your fetty up nigga, ol' petty ass nigga
Always talkin' bout a nigga, you a hoe ass nigga

Why you hatin' on that nigga? You don't know that nigga
Get your fetty up nigga, ol' petty ass nigga

[Verse 1: Devin Hill]
I blow all this paper, just like I'm ballin'
It's all in my system, first thing in the morning
I'm counting these bills, these blue hunnid bills
A young nigga made it, man, look at my house
Look at my whip (yeah)
We came from nothin', these fuck niggas bluffin'
Yeah I'm living lavish, yeah we live in luxury
You know how it is, you know how it is
A young nigga living, got these fuck niggas pissed

[Hook: Devin Hill]

[Verse 2: Quavo]
(Migo, Quavo!)
Everybody know you a hoe (you a hoe), hating cause you ain't get no dope (cash)
You mad cause me we smash on your hoe, her pussy so water I bought her a boat
Every time a nigga roll up the gas, you be looking like a nigga gonna pass
Slow your roll, boy, you moving too fast
Before I call up my niggas to get on your ass
You can hate all you wanna, cause we with the fuck shit
We like taking trash out, cause we like to dump shit
When we bring the bags out, we make your hoe pass out
Pipe it up, pipe it up
Walked in the mall, I just ripped the tag out
Age of eighteen, I wanted to flex so I brought the Jag out
These niggas be hating the way that I take the pipe, beat it up (Pacquiao)
These niggas be hating the flow we created , they copy the Migos style
The streets is a jungle, you think that I'm Tarzan, the way I survive the wild
You hatin' I'm watching the money pile (I'm stacking money little nigga)
I'm keeping my plug on speed dial (brrp, brrp, brrrrp)
FBI on us like X-Files (damn, damn, twelve!)
I hop on the jet and go ten-thousand miles

[Hook: Devin Hill]

[Verse 3: Devin Hill]
I could check out the check
Tell that bitch "check out the view"
Check out the jewels on my neck
These bitches ain't checking for you
Got a call from my niece, Miami it is
Now we up in Liv, yeah check out my bitch
My grind is in motion, yeah it's stretched like aerobics
I know your bitch notice ya', these fuck niggas notice ya'
You know how it is, you know how it is
A young nigga living,  got these fuck niggas pissed
