[Intro: Quavo]
Wassup Pablo? What's poppin?
You got them birds? D-low?
I need 'em, I want it

[Hook: Quavo]
Had this dream that I woke up in a 'Rari
Can't fuck with you niggas, I'm sorry
I'm too fly, I spread my wings and I'm soaring
Used to trap them birds, now I'm fly like a bird
B-birds
B-b-birds
Birds

[Verse 1: Quavo]
Just hit my phone if you want a bird
My niggas out right now on the curb
You can get a re-rock
You can get a whole serve
We locked and now I can front you
Young nigga that's my word
Walk in the bando, look at all them birds
Bando get low, re-up on the birds
Got shooters on pronto
Don't got no undo
At the age of 17 I hit my first kick do'
Just me and Willie Mac, Offset
Shoutout Domingo
Then 12 tried to get me
For gang activity
The judge dropped the charge, and I thank lord
That's why i take this mic and I go hard

[Hook: Quavo]
Had this dream that I woke up in a 'Rari
Can't fuck with you niggas, I'm sorry
I'm too fly, I spread my wings and I'm soaring
Used to trap them birds, now I'm fly like a bird
B-birds
B-b-birds
Birds

[Verse 2: Offset]
OFFSET!
Just got the word, just got the birds
Shabba Ranks gold only kick it with Ferg
You think you finessing me? Run off with ya bird
You gotta be kidding me
Charles Barkley, I got that broccoli
Fuckin' these bitches committing adultery
Trap fulla babies like an elementary
Bando with burglar bars, plugged in with Italian mobs
Don't never put trust in a broad
Im puttin' my trust up in God
I got birds, I got chickens, I got seagulls
Too many birds, my gun is an eagle
When I talk birds, I'm talkin' a kilo!

[Hook: Quavo]
Had this dream that I woke up in a 'Rari
Can't fuck with you niggas, I'm sorry
I'm too fly, I spread my wings and I'm soaring
Used to trap them birds, now I'm fly like a bird
B-birds
B-b-birds
Birds

[Verse 3: Takeoff]
The plug just hit my phone
For some funions, want an onion
Exotic crocodile skin Martens, call me Dundee
Tito want a brick, chico gotta cross the country
Carlito for a hundred, gave bout 50 to my mama!
I'm an OG in my hood, no Aretha, well respected
Toucan Sam pigeons, call me Ace Ventura, Pet Detective
I see falcons on a daily basis, Takeoff Arthur Blank
Whippin' chickens in the kitchen
Trap smell like a septic tank
Black 'n' gold everything, talkin' bout jewelry not the sink
I don't need no translator, I comprehend in a way
My plug Carlito, he can't speak no englo
All he knows is "andale"
I got bandos for the L-O
State-to-state, no real estate

[Hook: Quavo]
Had this dream that I woke up in a 'Rari
Can't fuck with you niggas, I'm sorry
I'm too fly, I spread my wings and I'm soaring
Used to trap them birds, now I'm fly like a bird
B-birds
B-b-birds
Birds
