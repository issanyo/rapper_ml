[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]
Yellow diamond ring on my fist like a pineapple
Shaped like a coke bottle, so I threw a dime on her (Damn)
Shine on her, grind on her, I might wine and dine her (Yeah)
Buy the bitch designer, I'm major, they minor (Wow)
Ty Dolla $ign, beach house to the trap house (Woah)
She might need a chiropractor, I'ma beat her back out (Wooh)
Coupe yellow, watch yellow, riding 'round with Cinderella
Big booty, thick bezel, Miss Lady got her shit together (Wow)

Pineapple rover, pineapple soda (Soda)
Got a thick yellow bitch, pineapple Lola
Might drive a 'Rari, yeah, I'm coming over
Might pick you up, then bend you over
Jump out the car (skrrt), shop 'til you drop (Drop)
