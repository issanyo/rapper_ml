[Intro: Quavo & (Prince Royce)]
Yeah, girl you look so good
And your body say you feelin' me
And I came from the hood
(It's your boy Royce)
So you know I brought some friends with me

[Verse 1: LIVVIA & (Quavo)]
Boy,  you went and got that poison on
And I feel like I can taste ya
It's like a million tiny paper cuts
Oh you’re sharp like diamonds
I like what it feels like (woo)
Take your aim, baby let the bullets fly
Oh, boy you got that poison on
Oh, damn your type of way is strong
And now I know

[Pre-Chorus: LIVVIA & (Quavo)]
The way you look is murder on my eyes
If looks could kill then damn I think I’ve died
You look so good it's, you look so good it's
Killin' me, killin' me (yeah)

[Chorus: LIVVIA]
Hold a body, catch a body
Hold a body, catch a body damn
Hold a body, catch a body
'Cause you look so good, it's killin' me, killin' me

[Post-Chorus: Quavo, LIVVIA & Prince Royce]
Woo, don't mind catch a body
'Cause you look so good, it's killin' me, killin' me
Killin' me, killin' me, killin' me, yeah, yeah
Oh, hold a body, catch a body
Killin' me, killin' me, killin' me
'Cause you look so good, it's killin' me, killin' me

[Verse 2: Prince Royce]
Killing me, yeah
Cuando te conocí, yeah
Ya supe que tú eras para mí (para mí)
Y no me importa donde sea
Ando tras de ella [?]
Si yo la llamo, ella está pa' mí
Voy a buscarla 488 GTB
And I'm about to catch a body
Si se meten contigo, mami

[Pre-Chorus: Prince Royce & LIVVIA]
Me matas cuando me miras así
Y cuando me besas vuelvo a morir
Te ves tan bien que, te ves tan bien que...
It's killin' me, killin' me

[Chorus: LIVVIA & Prince Royce]
Hold a body, catch a body
Hold a body, catch a body damn
Hold a body, catch a body
'Cause you look so good, it's killin' me, killin' me
