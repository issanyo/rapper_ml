[Intro]
Show'll, show'll, show'll

[Hook: Takeoff + (Quavo)]
Gotta have the paint double sealed (show'll)
Mansion on the hills that how we live (show'll)
Yeah we had it way before these rap deals (show'll)
I'm just keepin' it real ain't it (show'll)
And we said we gon' take off a year ago (sho' did)
Out the hundred green dab for my Migos (show'll)
All of you bullshit niggas they try to steal the flow (show'll)
Always lookin' for the dope but they don't know what's under the floor (sho' did)

[Verse 1: Quavo]
I got migos in the field
Kick in doors yeah we sho' did
This the life that a young nigga live
Offset told me to keep it real in the cell
It's all about the benjis
Do I need to mention?
I stood over the bowl
Spent the night in the kitchen, I sure did
What nigga you know walkin' the hood with 50 keys?
I feel like a king on my Mahatma Gandhi what it is?
I'm tired of my people shedding tears
I told 'em that we gonna make it that's the show'll
Independent life what is what we make it, nigga no deal

[Hook: Takeoff + (Quavo)]
Gotta have the paint double sealed (show'll)
Mansion on the hills that how we live (show'll)

And we said we gon' take off a year ago (sho' did)
Out the hundred green dab for my Migos (show'll)
All of you bullshit niggas they try to steal the flow (show'll)
Always lookin' for the dope but they don't know what's under the floor (sho'did)

[Verse 2: Offset]
Show'll Is I'm the wizard with show'll Is
Percocet sacks and I got the white grits
It's a robbery, I kidnapped your bitch
Breaking in houses, that was a big risk
Watchin' out for my kids so I didn't give an shit
Offset the boss you little niggas a prick
Family first, I'm the genie, they wish
I got the sack, ol' Saint Nick
Came from the burglary
Now that Audi doin' surgery
Money jumpin' straight up in the air vertically
Feelin' like Hercules, hit with the .33
Keep the piece 'fore they eat you like a reese's piece
Back to back in the county life with 0 G
All of my niggas on point we don't miss a beat
When you lookin' too long my nigga you offended me
Tennessee cause I got bricks for the 10 a key
Long story short, workin' my wrist and I'm breaking the fort
Keepin' my babies, I never abort
Juugin', finessin' the game like a sport
The block is so hot that you think it's a torch
I was 15 when jumped off the porch
I was 18 when I stole me a Porsche
Devils on my back, I prayed to the Lord

[Hook: Takeoff + (Quavo)]
