Yea, let's get it

[Hook: Lil Durk]
It look bad for a nigga, funeral set up, it look sad for a nigga
40 Ruger shooters, gave all that I had for a nigga
Where you from, what's your past lil nigga?
And you broke and you mad lil nigga?

Location on and we can meet lil nigga
Wifey holding down the street with my niggas
My gang claim three lil nigga
All this shit, that ain't me lil nigga
Got killers, every gang with me lil nigga
War time, shooters that's four-nine
Put a murder on bro that's more time
Up mine, I'ma shoot thirty four time
Or nah, cook a brick or nah?
Nigga say he ain't snitching but I know he lying
Lil nigga, lil nigga
Get money, get bigger

And we big niggas, and I lost a lot of shit, nigga (Let's get it)
Sip lean, get the kick, lil nigga

[Verse 2: Offset]
You a lil nigga and I'm a big dog (huh?)
You can die quick, nigga, only one call
I'm at the top and I'm never gone fall
Hundred round, make it clap like an applause
I pull up with Durk, hop out the vert (skrr, skrr)
(Braw Kraw!) six feet under the dirt
My diamonds is watery, you can come surf (water)
My plug is an alien not from this Earth
I had a dream like Mr. King (dream)
Geekin', I need some Visine
Gettin' money, runnin' all in my jeans (money)
Back in the day used to serve all the fiends (back Pimp C)
Actavis, I need lean (drink)
Porsche Panoramic, Forgiatos on the feet (panorama)
Young Rich Nigga, you ain't seen what I seen (no)
I used to trap mid as a teen (I did)
You niggas be copyin' my swag, you a clone (copy me)
Giuseppe steppin', ain't no Foams (Giuseppe me)
My bitch just landed here from Rome (bad)
Hop in the 'Rari, we gone (skrr, skrr)

[Verse 3: Cash Out]
You know I'm gettin' money, I pull up in foreigns, I jump out with shooters
He talk about robbin', we lay in his yard and bust his medula (we bustin' his head)
A million a day, when I'm in the trap I feel like Frank Lucas (I'm feelin' like him)
I iced out the Rollies, and stepped out the place, I only eat sushi
You know what I'm sippin', you know what I'm grippin' (you know what's on call)
I'm all on that, boss niggas got passes I know that they crippin' (you know what I'm crippin')
Give 'em the fork and give 'em the bowl, I know they ain't whippin' (I know they ain't in the pot)
Durk he flew in, I brought him to the trap and showed him my vision (I showed him what's up)
My shooters no clubbin' (my shooters no clubbin')
My shooters straight thuggin' (they thuggin' forreal)
Your shooters, they bluffin'
They go the feds and give 'em discussions (they give 'em discussions)
Whip it up, whip it up, baby I'm up in the bowl (I'm up in the bowl)
Back then, show money on your head, he dead on the stove (he dead on the stove)

[Hook: Lil Durk]

[Verse 4: Quavo]
None of my niggas is innocent (nah)
None of my niggas is witness
I pull up, unload the extensions
Walk in the trap and see pigeons
Birds (birds)
Migos, Lil Durk, Cash Out on the curb
Skippa Da Flippa itching for body, give him the word
Bet you won't bust a move
All my niggas got choppers, they'll damage you
Bet you won't bust a move
Have a nigga floatin' in the Chattahoochee river, fool
She cook it so fancy (whip, whip)
You niggas can't stand it (ha)
When I whip it, the J's they love it
I'm cooking a brick and they call me McLuvin'
Trap or die nigga, no Jeezy, corporate thuggin'
All of my niggas got gas and dirty sticks all out in public
My cup is so dirty, I'm drinkin' on Ruxman (lean, lean, dirty)
You niggas is soft, lookin' like Telletub-man

[Hook: Lil Durk]
It look bad for a nigga, funeral setup, I be all sad for a nigga

Where you from, what's your past lil nigga?
And you broke and you mad lil nigga?
Fuck a price what the tag lil nigga?
