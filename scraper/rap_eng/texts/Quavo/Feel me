[Hook: OG Maco]
Somebody in this motherfucker gotta feel me
Somebody in this motherfucker gotta feel me
Somebody in this motherfucker gotta feel me
Somebody in this motherfucker gotta feel me

[Verse 1: OG Maco]
You're looking at the man of the hour
While I got this cable
I rather wear Balmain while I don't have no [?]
I talking real strong bitch you may need chase off
Go chase your dreams cause I almost got slept on
Murdering everything they like man got this death on
Save lord while I'm sinning I'm hell hold
Seventy is forever, live life till I'm dead bones
Originality days, greatness got that fake shit in the lake [?]
Yeah!

[Hook: OG Maco & Quavo]
Somebody in this motherfucker gotta feel me
Somebody in this motherfucker gotta feel me
Migo! Maco!
Somebody in this motherfucker gotta feel me
Somebody in this motherfucker gotta feel me

[Verse 2: Quavo]
Quavo!
When I was broke they was feeling me
I'm rich now I'm having enemies
I own money never innocence
If you get money you feel me
Having nightmares about prison, then I woke up in the bentley
Having nightmares about business, then I woke up indepedent
Quavo and OG Maco tag team Capone and Rambo
We came from hancos from the popo now we handcuff ferragamo
First time in Russia I got 19 shows Bitch you guessin thats the assin hole
We came in the game and blow up of our clothes
When I ever started rapping I'm kicking doors
Migos and Maco in this motherfucker

[Hook: OG Maco]
Somebody in this motherfucker gotta feel me
Somebody in this motherfucker gotta feel me
