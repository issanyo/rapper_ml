[Chorus x2: Foxx ]
Lil mama work like she know it's good
Hit flo an twurk like she know it's good
She dance like she know it's, stand like she know it's good
Gotta sneak away from her ol man like she know it's good

[Verse: Foxx]
Girl I see yo thong showin, don't stop u keep goin
Them otha niggas make it drizzle, but I got pow'n
I been own that ton kailand so u know what I'm holla'n
Pull that thong to tha side an let me see yo private
I tell it's good good just by tha way u smile'n
Every nigga holla u shoot'em down like get from by me
U know he ridin factory, u know I'm on them thangs
U know he stuntin with his rent, U know I make that change
U know I holla a bay bay in tha club with hurricane
U know u ain't single u know u got a ol man, but I ain't trippin on ya boi cause I got goons
Belvedere, Extacy, plus I got rules
Workin that lil booty like u tryin to make a couple hun'ned, I break it off if u let me put that d**k in yo stomach, but that on tha low
I know u know I got a woman, but know what I just notice somethin girl

[Chorus x2: Foxx]

[Verse: Big Head]
U got weave in yo hair and u str8ght out that hood
That don't mean nathin, they hatin yo pu**y good
U miss good juug, u can really bleeze wood, yo brain game righteous, so raise up yo prices That kat be tha nicest, when that kat be tha tightest
Yo lipz be tha icest, when yo mouth be tha righteous
Watch he be delighted to go take u out an buy it
Just don't act excited stay in line and be quiet
I saw u at my show u was actin on tha flo
I threw u a lil dough, to show u u still glow
I felt real low, u I use to feel fo
Yo shape it still show, but yo kat it's still low
And I gave u tha business when u first came in it
An that been a lil minute threw tha days of business
Before I hate cha I'm a help don't settle for less
Cause u know that thang fire that's up under that dress Yes

[Chorus x2: Foxx]
I like tha way u form a line with cho big soft behind
Gotta a clicc of women with chu all of them big fine
Work it like u on clocc
Waz zup my name Foxx, well since we know each otha now den make that thang pop
U can tell that thang good, u got that juug
And we can do it tha bacc seat or on tha hood
How u do that in them shoes, that's what I wanna know
We finna hit tha Embassy u auda wanna go
Rockin them staletto's tryna talk like u ghetto
Str8ght up out tha suburbs a** shakin like jello
I'm tryin to get cha right cause I wanna be in that monkey
All them otha gurls lookin, but u tha one act a donkey
Workin that lil booty like u tryin to make a couple hun'ned, I break it off if u let me put that d**k in yo stomach, but that on tha low
I know u know I got a woman, but know what I just notice somethin girl

[Chorus x2: Foxx]
