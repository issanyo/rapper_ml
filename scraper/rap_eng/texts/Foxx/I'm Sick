[Verse 1:]
Ha chu excuse me bless my cough
Being that clean should be against the got damn law
Step off in the club baley make my ass to the bar
Everybody wanna holla so I guess I'm a star
And my fit owww so sick
Patna you can't offord it so just get off of my dick
And neck piece nothin but a sex piece
My wrist game gimme brain
My ear game make em chu chu run a train
I'm so trill with it
If you don't like the way Lil Foxx rock kill yoself cause you gon have to deal with it
I'm not a stunna
I'm a show off
And I ain't seen a mill yet just wait you gon really see me go off

[Hook: x2]
My chain got a cold, my watch go the flu
My whip got cancer and my rims got it too
My fit got a fever I mean that shit
Everything I own I swear it's sick

[Verse 2:]
Why these niggas keep a hatin on me
Is it the ice I rock are the money I see
The big fine bitches are the hundreds I see
The 4's on the rove are that old skool thing
The coogi are the gucci
