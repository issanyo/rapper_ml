I been poppin (I'm not myself)
I been drinkin (I'm not myself)
I been smokin (I'm not myslef)
Man I'm rollin (I'm not myself)

I'm not myself right now

I step up in the club neck and wrist on chill
Eyes bloody red cause I'm full of that kill
Kinda tipsy but I still got behind the wheel
Got to VIP and ask the ballas what's the deal
My bodyguard with me standing taller than Shaquille
Hoes run up to me hollin don't you rap with trill
I shake my head yeah probably flirt with them a lil
Talkin em into drinkin probably make em pop a pill
I'm COOGI up so everybody know I'm kinda wealthy
I'm lookin for a bad bitch thick and kinda healthy
Ain't no sense a muggin neither cars gars dealt me
I got this shit from grindin this ain't what nobody left me
I see a couple niggas I don't like and now I'm bootin
I'm hollin take it outside cause I'm a start shootin
Boy I ain't myself right now don't make me do it
Boy I ain't myself right now I'm on that fluid

I been poppin (I'm not myself)
I been drinkin (I'm not myself)
I been smokin (I'm not myslef)
Man I'm rollin (I'm not myself)

I'm not myself right now

Four hundred for the fit a bill fifthy for the bapes
You jumpin like some monkies I just post her with the apes
If you ain't talkin money I don't think I can relate
Cause foxx about his benjamins and that's of the cake
If it ain't makin money I don't want participate
Cause lil one need diapers and his mamma need cake
So on the strength of that I be posted on the block
If I ain't in the kitchen with the stove on hot
Fa now I'm in the club with the hoes on lock
Cause in the parking lot I got the 4s on the drop
Don't make you reck yo car because my rims don't stop
You think I den pulled off and you then ran and got popped
My jewelry game retarded I be icy like a freezer
So when it comes to cookies you can call me Mr.Keebler
I do it for the hood and I do it for my people
I really ain't myself right now I'm off the meter

I been poppin (I'm not myself)
I been drinkin (I'm not myself)
I been smokin (I'm not myslef)
Man I'm rollin (I'm not myself)

I'm not myself right now

I run it hot done it on sugar coodated
Every week another wift of niggas who be hatin
I'm outcha gettin money while you rudy fools cakin
I'm poppin drinkin smokin gettin high than a hation
I buy the bar leave the club cause I could do that
Trill then cut the check but I already blow that
I got that white girl and you already knew that
I pull up in that caddy niggas holla who dat
I'm not myself right nah think I'm somebody else
Nigga say he took my chain bitch you could kill yoself
I'm from LOUISIANA baton rouge stand up
If you ain't on them drugs all night then put yo hands
I ain't with that rap beat so get yo beat up off the lug
Talkin all that shit and you a internet thug
I got that goon squad with me you could play if you want
And wake you silly ass up in my trunk I'm NOT MYSELF RIGHT NOW!

I been poppin (I'm not myself)
I been drinkin (I'm not myself)
I been smokin (I'm not myslef)
Man I'm rollin (I'm not myself)

I'm not myself right now
YEAH!
