[Verse 1: Daw$on]
My phone been jumping up and down like acrobatics
They all want to know my story, used to care about my status
Now I find myself preoccupied, I’m always chasing rabbits
And I swear I been addicted since your girl told me to add her
Swear to god
I been working hard for a minute
Now my notifications poppin’, they pop up every second
Want to know my location, what I’m doing like every second
So I tell ‘em
I been going hard for a minute
Now my old friends be calling me
New friends be calling me
Your girlfriend just followed me
They see a lot of me
So much attention you’d think that I just won the lottery
Yeah, where would I be now if all of the hate really got to me?
Yeah, all my songs are hits, I swear that I be bumpin’
Jumpman, Jumpman, Jumpman, my Snapchat be jumping!

[Hook]
My Snapchat’s jumping! My Snapchat’s jumping!
Snapchat doing numbers, Snapchat me something!
My Snapchat’s jumping! My Snapchat’s jumping!
Snapchat doing numbers, Snapchat me something!
My Snapchat’s jumping! My Snapchat’s jumping!
Snapchat doing numbers, Snapchat me something!
My Snapchat’s jumping! My Snapchat’s jumping!

[Verse 2: iLoveMemphis]
Memphis First 48, Snapchat 24
I watch her thirst shots real late, right before they go
I just caught a body, I just caught a body
It go down in the DMs, go get Yo Gotti
We be Milly Rocking, pop it, lock it, drop it Hoo-ray!
Y’all found out my Allstate tryna steal some boxes, Tuesday
She want Netflix and some chill but all I got is Blu Ray
I just want to be on my Snapchat and drink my Kool-Aid
Please do not be boring, I’ll skip through your stories
And don’t screenshot my pic ‘cause bae is looking for me
You can’t slide in my DMs, you must be the warden
Thank you god, I just went platinum, I feel too important!
