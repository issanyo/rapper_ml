[Verse]
Yeah
Oh, what are these?
Clean pair of kicks
And I'm ballin like LeBron so I do not sit on the bench
So I'm ballin like a bitch
Wit no hair since she was six
Or ballin like a flat tire
With rollin sith this
I'm ballin like I can I get extension
And I'm ballin like players of Olympics
I'm balling back to back I need no pants
Back to back like I'm Jordan
97' 96'
I'm back to back better yet like new girlfriend
I'm ballin like my baby, got a baby girlfriend
Said I'm ballin like a [?] every body watching
I'm ballin that VIP
Man its money where I spend

[Hook]
