Me and you are not the same
Flexin' with my skins, they cannot be tamed
Flexin' on my ex, this is not a game
I bet you gon' remember my name
I'm walkin' on air
I bet they stop and stare
I'm walkin' on air
I bet they stop and stare

On my road to riches, [?]
[?]
Dance moves in my new shoes, roll out too smooth
And cool, breaking all the rules, I'm like "Who are you?"
Now it's time to get it, It's time to [?]
I'm walkin' on air, [?]
I make them stop and stare, [?]
Now pull yo' phones out, [?] with the exit

Me and you are not the same
Flexin' with my skins, they cannot be tamed
Flexin' on my ex, this is not a game
I bet you gon' remember my name
I'm walkin' on air
I bet they stop and stare
I'm walkin' on air
I bet they stop and stare

I'm in it with my dance moves, I'm hard man, please don't bluff
I be busy and they know they losin', I'm not givin' up
Shawty dick is a [?]
Told her hit me over [?], she just wanna fuss
I be, out of my mind
I be, walkin' on air
I be, lit all the time
I be, pullin' her hair
I be drippin' with the dance moves sittin' in a chair
I be drippin' like the [?], I feel like the mayor
She said she need some space
I said, "What can we share?"
She said get out her face
I said, "Life isn't fair"
She said she need a break
I said, "Well true or dare?"
She said, "What is the truth? That you walkin' on air right now"

Me and you are not the same
Flexin' with my skins, they cannot be tamed
Flexin' on my ex, this is not a game
I bet you gon' remember my name
I'm walkin' on air
I bet they stop and stare
I'm walkin' on air
I bet they stop and stare
