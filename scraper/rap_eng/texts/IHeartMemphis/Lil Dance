[Verse: iHeartMemphis]
Imma just do my lil dance
And Put lil mama in a trance yea
Skinny jeans with the vans, yea
I might do my lil spin
She don't have friends (Why)
Cause they all to messy, yea
And she don't have a man (Why)
Cause her ex been flexing, yea
KumKorec is the crew
Richard Jackson busting moves
Boy you smooth, you the bomb
Like tic tic tic boom
Boy give me room
Sweet competition with the broom
Im the man on the moon
Call me off A-List Coming Soon
Yea Yea Yea (Turn Up Right Now)
And I Don't Care
She said she got a attitude
And then she swung her hair
I hit her with these dance moves
And made her stop and stare
I show her what these bands do, Cause iHeart Like to share
Yea Yea Yea
Now I slow it down, then I switch it up
She don't come around, I don't blame her
Yea Yea Yea
She see me on the town, Plus I'm Memphis bound
Imma act a clown cause I'm famous (YEAA)

[Chorus: Dkotic]
Imma just do my lil dance
Imma just do my lil dance
Imma just do my lil dance

Watch me do it, watch me do it yea
Watch me do it, watch me do it yea
Watch me do it, watch me do it yea
Watch me do it, watch me do it yea

Imma just do my lil dance

Watch me do it, watch me do it yea
Watch me do it, watch me do it yea
Watch me do it, watch me do it yea
