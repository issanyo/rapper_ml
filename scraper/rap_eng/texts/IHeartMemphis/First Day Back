[Intro]

[Swae Lee]
Uhh, yeah
Hocus, we back, uh

[Hook: Chorus]
Ain't nobody know she go slow when she hold it
That's why I held back when I wrote this
But I'm back now, yeah it's hocus
Got a gold chain but still broke like Cobain
Tryna get this money, no dope game


[Verse 1: Swae Lee]
Uh, guess you can't focus your efforts
To try to make yo shit look better
Just face it I'm cheesin, it's fuck all your cheddar
It's fuck all your net worth
Oh, your head shots make yo head hurt?
Oh, my deadlifts ain't shit but a feather that I flew away with tryna weather
Yeah
The storm of the norms that you poured in of course
It's funny I wrote this but don't give a fuck so I'm feelin like fuck all remorse
Not above trying to settle the score
Dame Lill, one second in the 4th

[Hook: Chorus]
Ain't nobody know she go slow when she hold it
That's why I held back when I wrote this
But I'm back now, yeah it's hocus
Got a gold chain but still broke like Cobain
Tryna get this money, no dope game

[Verse 2: iLoveMemphis]
Get the fuck up out my face, with these faces
You got better luck up out my way, don't say shit
It's my time only way I fade away is  from the J hit
I'm crossfaded on the lettuce, dressin sharp like Thugga, Jayden
Im just tryna blow up all on my pervasive
Michael Bay shit
Underage but catch me out in Vegas
Or in Cancun with the crew you know we climb the runes
You know all my Latinas swoon, yeah

[Hook: Chorus]
Ain't nobody know she go slow when she hold it
That's why I held back when I wrote this
But I'm back now, yeah it's hocus
Got a gold chain but still broke like Cobain
Tryna get this money, no dope game
