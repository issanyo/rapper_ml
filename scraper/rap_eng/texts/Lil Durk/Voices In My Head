[Hook:]
I got voices in my head tell me buy expensive shit
I got voices in my head tell me buy the newest whip
I got voices in my head (In my head)
I got voices in my head (In my head)
I got voices in my head saying the feds on me
I got voices in my head saying niggas' police
I got voices in my head (In my head)
I got voices in my head (In my head)

[Verse: 1]
I got voices in my head saying the feds on me
And I kinda believe it cause sell 'bout 63
I got [?] for the low make your connect come shout with me
Cause my name what it is make your bitch give top to me
Rolling up this dope you see I'm higher than I'm supposed to be
Police ass niggas and these bitches can't get close to me
Phantom ghost keep telling me, put this white all over me
Louis squares all over me, these Gucci jeans all over me
Purp shit, mix it with the Sprite you get that perfect shit
Hate it when I get high then i run into a dirty bitch
Love it when I get new pussy cause she know I murder it
Voices in my head telling Lil Durk to murder it
(Squad!)

[Hook:]

[Verse: 2]
Keep the Glock up in the box, police all into me
No Twitter shit, you snitching in the jam just don't mention me
Friends turn to enemies, all the one they friendemies
Flexing on the nigga know my finger be my Bentley key
Semi bitch, off the Remy bitch, give me remy bitch
Always saying give me bitch, all she know is give me dick
Penny shit, always had to grind, they ain't give me shit
300, OTF, GBE, we been the shit
Stunt cause I want too
Flex cause I want too
Money team, I could spend a check if I want to
Flex if I want too
Stunt if I want too
Money team, I could blow a check if I want to
