[Intro: Cdot Honcho]
Aye Honcho Honcho Honcho Honcho

[Chorus: Lil Durk]
Fo Nem call for me I'm on my way
Don't bring his ass around lil bitch you ruin my day
Tryna catch me lackin' boy it ain't no way (come on)
Boy you ain't no killa you just in the way
Or end up dead or wit a fuckin' case
Or Fo Nem standing over you and take yo face
Don't do shit for your homie but you scream "Free Tay-K"
(When he) get out that jam I'm going to get him AK's
Put down my AB cause I want a plain Jane
Took a snap of my chain chain fo nem go flame flame
Free my young niggas out that lil chain gang
Cause my gang gang on the same thing

[Verse 1: Lil Durk]
We the main reason yo homie picture on yo default
Shoot his ass with that Glock it ain't got no decal
40 with the monkey nuts it hit his peanut
And we smoked his ass out like Teo
Shootout err night, it ain't safe to hang around us
Fuck it, pop em broad day, definitely if it ain't no cameras
Stop it boy you ain't no savage
Shot that man ain't do no damage
Made yo bed, lay in yo pallet
Bitch i'm grateful (DJ Khaled)
Thats two bodies for Chino Dollar
Say they seen a grey Impala
Mix up with them grey Jordans
They don't feel em, Foenem scorin'
We ain't shooting' from no window
Foenem sellin' pillow
I'm from 064 like Nintendo
Nigga smokin' indo
Ridin' though the city with no tinted windows
Police pull me over over drugs in my Timbos
Who just shot (I don't know)
Who block this is (I don't know)
Did he tell (Uh huh)
Is you fo real (uh huh)
I'm a g, that's a rat (go)
Fuck from the back
No feelins attached
What he gon snatch
What he gon take
Who he gon swing on
What he gon' break
You know imma snake
Two faced
Know I'm quiet
Keep that iron
No point in tryin'
He know he dyin'
Ran out of time
Took his mind
Turn up

[Chorus: Lil Durk & Cdot Honcho]
Foenem call for me I'm on my way
Don't bring his ass around lil bitch you ruin my day
Tryna catch me lackin' boy it ain't no way (Come on)
Boy you ain't no killa you just in the way
Or end up dead or wit a fuckin' case
Or Foenem standing over you and take yo face
Don't do shit for your homie but you scream "Free Tay-K"
(When he) get out that jam I'm going to get him AK's
Put down my AP cause I want a plain Jane
Try to stain my chain chain Foenem go flame flame
Free my young niggas out that lil chain gang
Cause my gang gang that same thing
Honcho Honcho Honcho Honcho

[Verse 2: Cdot Honcho]
Ayy
That bitch schemin' she pull up cut off her ringtone
Put my racks around my thighs can't keep my jeans on
Too much numbers on my dash I get my speed on
Sent yo address to the guys no you can't leave home
Bitch, all niggas I looked out for I can't lean on
[?] Red Bull at 5 like it got wings on
Foenem they sweep though yo shit swear they ass won't be long
Put friends up on the T but the ain't VLone, bitch
Niggas gon try I know but they ain't
100 round clips what they ate
They ain't heard shit but VH loud I swear ainâ€™t no catching them T8s
I swear I'm too busy for court dates
She know I'm too busy for horseplay
I do that show her the door way, aye
It's three hoes that be four ways
Foenem on point always damn try sum yo life delay
No clear Foenem invade, aye we cannot kick it it's deflated
They in y'all shit like y'all related
It's a full house we gon vacate it
Skurrt off 12 tryna locate it, bitch

[Chorus: Lil Durk]
Fo Nem call for me I'm on my way
Don't bring his ass around lil bitch you ruin my day
Tryna catch me lackin' boy it ain't no way
Boy you ain't no killa you just in the way
Or end up dead or wit a fuckin' case
Or Fo Nem standing over you and take yo face
Don't do shit for your homie but you scream "Free Tay-K"
(When he) get out that jam I'm going to get him AK's
Put down my AB cause I want a plain Jane
Took a snap of my chain chain fo nem go flame flame
Free my young niggas out that lil chain gang
Cause my gang gang that same thing
