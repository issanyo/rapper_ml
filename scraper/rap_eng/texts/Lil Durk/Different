[Hook]
I done seen my homies sell dope to my homies motha
I done see my homies sell dope to an undercover
I done see you real niggas tell it all to undercover
These niggas suppose to be my niggas claiming that we brothers
I done had to open my eyes to em, they say we guys
I done see who was gon' ride too
See that's what made me different (x2)

[Verse: 1]
See im mad at these niggas today, more loyal than the niggas than last year
If loyalty was the key, these niggas won't last here (Won't last here)
And they lyin to em, Put my life on the line for 'em
Studio 24 every night i gotta grind for 'em (let's get it)
My momma had told me they don't love you (they don't love you)
But I ain't Listen momma, I know these niggas ain't for you (I'm sorry momma)
These niggas throwing L's like these niggas loyal
When you was locked up they didn't pay for that lawyer
Gettin nice jobs (Nice Jobs)
Sneak dissing over bitches I call it backstab
I Got that last laugh, Put em on top now
I gotta keep going for my kids and I can't stop now

I done see who was gon' ride too
See that's what made me different, See that's what made me different

[Verse: 2]
Don't bite the hand that feed you, these niggas that need you
Some niggas need one head shot, some  niggas they need two
They need them niggas, the same time they need you
But I was all down till the lean talk for me like
These niggas ain't real, im going in for the kill
I've been that nigga before this deal (lets get it)
I told my niggas I make a mill' (Yea)
Sniff a opp, take 'em out
Real to my niggas, never fake em out (Real niggas since day one)
So many bricks I can make a house (Get bricks) (Get Bricks)
And where I'm from you don't make it out
