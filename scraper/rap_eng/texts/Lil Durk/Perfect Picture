Yeah, (Yeah)
This nigga ain't really fuckin wit us man
Got this shit guaranteed on lock

[Hook: Lil Durk]
Iont think my shit don't sta-a-a-ank
Not picture perfect, shit like that
I'm on top of my city
Whoever thought some shit like that?
Now I be driving foreign cars
That picture perfect shit like that
Whoever thought I'd be a sta-a-a-a-ar?
Picture perfect shit like that
Ayy-a-a-ayy

[Verse 1: Lil Durk]
Now dis ain't what you want
Only drop some shit like dat
Name an auto-tunin nigga
That'll drop some shit like dat
They say they snatch yo shit
I get yo shit right back
If you ain't with a 5s
I can't picture tha-a-a-a-ayy
Picture perfect panorama Porsche
You a pussy, still on forces
Those are ghosts, I'm hearin voices
Made a "M" by makin choices
That make me see these hata's
Truest colors
Free my brothers
Die for them
Thats on my mother
Alot of kids before 21
(Whoever thought?)
Alot of niggas snake you for your mon'
(Whoever thought?)
I never thought
I buy the shit I never bought
Or them cases that I caught
If I never called

[Hook: Lil Durk]
Iont think my shit don't sta-a-a-ank

That picture perfect shit like that
Whoever thought I'd be a sta-a-a-a-ar?
Picture perfect shit like that

[Verse 2: Lil Durk]
Public houses, public schools
Only eatin public food

Ain't nobody believe me
Call me phony, call me greedy
Niggas mad cuz they ain't eating

Nobody had time for it
I had to put my mind to it
