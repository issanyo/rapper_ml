[Intro]
Ayo nigga, ayo Fraud
These niggas always gon' be financially frustrated
Till you start making music like this nigga
You niggas ain't got no money, nigga
Cause you niggas always got time
Nigga I got money nigga
I ain't got time for you niggas
Holla!

[Hook]
That shit is all game
You ain't gotta lie to me, I don't trust no ho
Man you niggas is lame
Why you tryna fuck with me
What you niggas homo?
I wake up with your mom
She on E, is your bro
I got what you need
Man you niggas is plain
You ain't gotta lie to me, they don't want you no mo

[Verse 1: French Montana]
You niggas piercin' yo nipples on the angel dust
They say if money ain't change you, you ain't make enough
Born a hustle, rap game new thing to me
You niggas ain't even a quarter what you claim to be
On my way to the money I don't hear a whisper
You niggas flies on me, I ain't got the time homie
You drive expeditions, you need recognition
You want the whole world to stop and hear you rap and listen
You want to be 50, you want to be Hov
You try come up overnight but you niggas broke
White V's, white T, white bitch slurpin'
Them Coke Boys niggas working

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Look, when you lookin' at the city from the top, that shit is beautiful
It feels good this message is so musical
Never hood-bound, I get around like a hula-hoop
Top down, riding 'round, that's the usual
These lil niggas all in my space
I would put my hands on 'em but that ain't my taste
This motivation is money, my days wasn't sunny
Niggas still movin' deep, charge 50 for the bunny
This cocaine all in my city, might catch 'em ridin' 'round with a bad ass bitty
To get flyer you gon' need more than a set of wings
More fucking problems, that's where the shit is lame

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
I don't what it is or why niggas do the things they do
Like we ain't been settin' fire to booths, my whole team is the truth
I advise you to get in a loop
Get outta line or trust these Coke Boys to do what they do
Who woulda knew that we'd be the savior of the city, if not
The whole new Jeanie then the Bronx gotta feel me
Firin' till they kill me, it's hard to put 'em out
Extinguisher is the works of alarms ringing out
Water done dried up, but I got juice if you need it
That ass wipe nuts so wanna woof, believe me nigga
I'm who they believe in, nigga
I'm driving a Maybach and Beamers, nigga

[Hook]
