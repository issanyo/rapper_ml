Don't forget about me
This bigger than money, this bigger than fame
Remember everything that I did to get where I'm at
Please don't take it from me
Said I wouldn't change
I'm still the same, and they love it
You can hate me or love me
But I bet you remember, I bet you remember
Remember my name...

[Verse 1: Lil Durk]
They never remember
I did time for a gun, that I never remember
Did time with my son been delivered
I cried tears, I couldn't show em my position
No sleep in the hallways
Me being me sipping lean with a 30 like always
Couldn't afford trues now I sleep with Versace and Balmain
Then I hit the streets with lights on
Still slept with the rats and the cockroaches
Lost niggas , I lost bitches, I lost time
But I'm back on the block though
Gang with me also but its bigger than money
Every car is vellano
They say I won't make it
Now they favor, I got 20 to play with
Grew up on Chicago South side, where you get killed if you outside
And I made it out, and I'm outside
Name hold weight like a motherfucker
And I love my niggas like blood brothers
Same niggas, same gang can't change on em
War time, no movie, but I bet that clip gon' hangover

[Verse 2: Lil Durk]
Real street nigga, made it from the bottom
Coming up as a kid niggas gave him nothing
12 years old knew I was a problem
All I wanted was money and the fame
Cars, cribs, and bitches wouldn't name
I can't change for nothing in this world
Lord blessed me two boys and a girl
Two dead cause I lost to this world
Crossed over like Flo Rida
Only my squad they both sliding
Money and power they both riding
Caught him and him and they both sliding
Trap house, block party, niggas doing the same shit
They got nothing
And niggas try me and that Mac bust
And they remember my name...
