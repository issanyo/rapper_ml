[Intro]
DY Krazy

[Chorus: Lil Durk]
Definitely, fifteen thousand for my backend
Definitely, blew that check up like it ain't shit
Definitely, and I'm too real, I'm too legit
Most definitely, I'm rockin' shit that you can't get
Most definitely, I keep my word, I keep my word
Most definitely, ain't nothin' flier than a bird
Definitely, don't ever listen to what you heard
Most definitely, and I know the truth hurts

[Verse 1: Lil Durk]
I take you to Paris, we can go shopping
And I'm just ballin' like the Globetrotters
Got into a shootout in my new Foamposites
Jail call on the jet, I done lost service
Switchin' lanes inside the coupe, the roof missin'
Found me guilty with no proof, too vicious
We both birds, I'm a vulture, you a stool pigeon
All these stories, they been poppin' out the blue with it
Niggas be doin' that criminal watch, they in the hood with it
Niggas ain't really got no money, can't live in my subdivision
And the bitch tried to put me on blast 'cause I ain't go public with it
And I fucked it up at Saks, blew a dub addition
I let 'em sleep 'round a hundred racks, ain't a dub missin'
She put my dick inside her throat, feel like her tongue missin'
And you know your ass a joke if your guns missin'
And we only smokin' dope, feel like my lungs missin'

[Chorus: Lil Durk]
Definitely, fifteen thousand for my backend
Definitely, blew that check up like it ain't shit
Definitely, and I'm too real, I'm too legit
Most definitely, I'm rockin' shit that you can't get
Most definitely, I keep my word, I keep my word
Most definitely, ain't nothin' flier than a bird
Definitely, don't ever listen to what you heard
Most definitely, and I know the truth hurts

[Verse 2: Lil Keed]
Most definitely, I know the truth hurts (Keed talk to 'em)
And I got all these bitches checkin' on me like a nurse (Like a nurse)
You forgot to tell 'em I put a lil' bankroll in your purse (Nah, you ain't tell 'em that)
You forgot to tell 'em I fell back in that Maybach, close the curtains (Nah, you ain't tell 'em that)
Got me ridin' luxury
And I made you leave where I'm 'posed to be
My homie shoot at you and he got accuracy
Come get your baby mama, yeah, she after me (Yeah, she after me)
You can have that ho, I hit her first, you after me
I'm throwin' them ones up to the ceiling (Throwin' 'em, throwin' 'em, throwin' 'em)
I was callin' for you and y'all didn't hear me
Avianne diamonds got me shinin'
These millions right in front of me, perfect timin'
Uh, uh, uh, definitely, definitely
Yeah, I ran them bands up, mainly my specialty (My special')
My mama call my phone and say she proud of me (Brrt)
(I love you too, Mama)
I just live at my house

[Chorus: Lil Durk]
Definitely, fifteen thousand for my backend
Definitely, blew that check up like it ain't shit
Definitely, and I'm too real, I'm too legit
Most definitely, I'm rockin' shit that you can't get
Most definitely, I keep my word, I keep my word
Most definitely, ain't nothin' flier than a bird
Definitely, don't ever listen to what you heard
Most definitely, and I know the truth hurts
