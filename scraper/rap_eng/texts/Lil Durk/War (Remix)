Now when you don't respect me, I'm gonna spank your ass
I don’t give a fuck how rich you got; on the block, I’m your big brother. I will break your big ass down. And that’s my only point

They talkin' that twitter shit well they can talk to my shooters
Said I'm a wanna-be, do you wanna be in yo future?
I can call up my shooters and have em blow like a tuba
Put you to rest, you be laying next to JoJo and Tooka
I be posted on the six I got the tec with the cooler
Think you hot? When it's hot, shit will definitely cool ya boy
You send some shots,  you gonna need you a mover
In the church, while your momma screamin' out Hallelujah
Pussy nigga a rat he belong in the sewer
And your bitch she a thot, for the squad she gon' do it
Talkin' like they want war, but when it's war we ain't losing
Call up Durk and 300, ya'll want a war then lets do it!
