Lil Durk - Loyalty Over Royalty

[Lil Durk, Chorus]:
Loyalty over royalty real street nigga
Yeah the street love me but the street don't show no love
When it's war in my city we shed blood
All I know is blood, blood, blood
All I know is blood, blood, blood (all I know is blood, yeah)

[Hypno Carlito]
I got a feeling a lot of these niggas
Really admire a nigga
I just do me I don't try to be niggas
Niggas be trying too hard
You say you a killer, quit lying lil nigga
Shots get to flying that's when niggas get dropped
Now you looking for God lil nigga
Don't even start lil nigga
I'm about loyalty, I'm not no wannabe
I'm just what you wanna be now you gonna know it's me
Bitch get a load of me ain't no controlling me
I got that bandanna on like I'm Makaveli
Mixed with Hispanic my daddy heavy
Making shit work cause I love my daughter
I don't want her to say daddy left me
Y'all talk about a body count
See your body is a body found
Can't nobody calm me down
My city lost right now
You get knocked off right now
If you wanna live long
Please don't get involved right now

[Chorus]

[Lil Varney]
Certified street nigga, but I ain't trying to preach nigga
To any nigga, rich nigga
Mack on repeat, I stay to snaking these niggas
They aim and they plot
I can't relate, these niggas bitches they fake
No love do a drill, east side when we drill
Your niggas ain't real
Pressure I apply, might dress in disguise
We kill when we wild, bruh niggas divide
We never get tired, we always outside
Get caught on my side, like chicken you fried (chicken fried yeah)

[Lil Durk]
Loyalty over royalty
Family over friends
OTF over everything
Lord forgive me for my sins

[Chorus]
