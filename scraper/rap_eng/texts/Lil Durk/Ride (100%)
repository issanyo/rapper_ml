[Snippet: Lil' Durk]

Ain't too my niggas out here that, that, that'll ride for they block
Ain't too my niggas out here that, that, that'll ride for they block
Ain't too my niggas out here that, that's gon' ride for they squad

[Intro: RondoNumbaNine, Lil' Durk]

Seperate the real from the fake!
She on' fuck a lotta' these niggas out here, man!
We introduced these niggas to a lotta' shit
That's what we did, bro?
My squad!
Free the guys, man!
L's!
Turn up, turn up!
Glah!
Steve Drive

[Hook: Lil' Durk]

Ain't too my niggas out here that, that, that'll ride for they block
Ain't too my niggas out here that, that's gon' ride for they squad
But it's niggas out here like me, that, that, that, that's gon' go hard
But it's niggas out here like me, that, that, that, that's gon' go hard

[Verse 1: Lil' Durk]

Ain't a lotta' niggas out here like me that's deep in that field
Ain't a lotta' niggas that got deals that's gon' go drill like I drill
Lost too many niggas, you ain't gon' feel like I feel
Smoking dope, pour up a four, and I don't pop no pills
I seen a lotta' niggas go and tell on they mans
A 'hunnid grand, ask about me, I never took stand
We doing hits, popping in and out of them vans
Nigga say he on me, boy I don't take no chance
Cause I'm that nigga, throw them L's for them hittas
These niggas they bitches, only time they mentioned when they playing on Twitter
Dog Pound they wit' us, Fo' Six they wit' us
These niggas be tripping, that nigga 'round me, everybody they hittas
Squad!

[Hook: Lil' Durk, sing twice]

Ain't too my niggas out here that, that, that'll ride for they block
Ain't too my niggas out here that, that's gon' ride for they squad
But it's niggas out here like me, that, that, that, that's gon' go hard
But it's niggas out here like me, that, that, that, that's gon' go hard

[Verse 2: RondoNumbaNine]

I'mma youngin' like bro and I'm real, no joke, so bitch I'mma go hard
They took L'A, so they gotta' pay, and sucker I'mma go hard
Me and bro [?]
I done seen a lotta' shit, I done did a lotta' shit, and I still [?]
I'm OTF, I'mma leave you left if you tweaking with squad
I need a lil' bitch, a lil' foreign lil' bitch, a lil' sum' like Minaj
I'm right here, Durk
If he tweak then put him on a shirt
Late night, that bitch I lurk
And all these goofy niggas looking like jerk
Smoking dope, I'm off that earth
In Chiraq, this my turf
Talk tough, then a pussy getting murked
[?], have a nigga so hurt
We spit that bitch gon' squirt
Robin Jeans gotta' bitch wanna' flirt
Double cups and the cups full of purp
All these scary niggas, bitch go to church

[Hook: Lil' Durk, sing twice]

Ain't too my niggas out here that, that, that'll ride for they block
Ain't too my niggas out here that, that's gon' ride for they squad
But it's niggas out here like me, that, that, that, that's gon' go hard
But it's niggas out here like me, that, that, that, that's gon' go hard
