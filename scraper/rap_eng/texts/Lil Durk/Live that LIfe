Bum Rappers getting weak on the hooks (they weak)
Yo' homie called and said he starving he low on the books (lets get it)
You steady posting money on the books (face)
Thats Instagram, thats instagram thats tell it all
Yo' life on instagram and he'll tell it all (pussy)
You get jacked up for some books and he'll tell it all
Thats why ? on me. tell bro to mail it off
Four shooters with me no bitches, set it off

We rob for pounds, you rob for chains
Get caught no saying names
We see you blow yo brains(x2)
Get caught you saying names
