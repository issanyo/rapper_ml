[Hook - Lil Durk]
Can't finesse a finesse-a that shit unheard of
Call my squad with the Mac they talkin' word up
In Chiraq damn near everyday we purge 'em
Don't let a sneak diss turn to a murder
We catch a body my niggas gon' catch a body
Catch a homi my niggas gon' catch a homi
Go get that money my niggas gon' get that money
Don't let that sneak diss turn to a murder

[Verse 1 - Lil Durk]
Where he stay at
Where he lay at
Oh you got a big crib, lil bro where the k at?
Spit from the clip no latex
In the hood where it ain't safe at
Ask any nigga was I ever on that block?
Only a nigga say no is the hoes or the opps, on my pops
I was in the land with them mops
And I know from my deal what's the lineup
Talking life like a nigga with a camera
Pour a 4 in that Fanta
Grab the lean from the manor
I'm a big ol' nigga 150 with that hammer
Glock for the tears and burnt candles
Coupe roof open like sandals
Homicide on the scene and they wildin'
Like who did this they wildin'
OTF we promote violence
Everywhere I go I hear sirens
RIP Nuski and Iris
Ain't fuckin' 'round with no fuck niggas
My momma told me don't fuck with them if they don't fuck witcha

[Hook]

[Verse 2 - Ike Boy]
My lil niggas they really about that murda'
Fonem love them drills but they doing hits outside Excursions
You broke boys hella broke boy you niggas ain't got a dollar
My partners love them bodies just bought them niggas some choppas
Yo' bitch say she on some but I ain't with the cuffin'
I treat her like a chopper that bitch gon' have to bus' it
Don't let that sneak diss nigga turn into a murda
My lil niggas wildin' with the mops they out here purgin'
Shots got through your window so you betta' close ya' curtains
And I be out here plottin' so the shit just gonna get worse
And bitch I'm a finesse-a
My squad out here finesse-in'

[Hook]
