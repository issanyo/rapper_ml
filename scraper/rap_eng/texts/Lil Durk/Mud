[Hook]
Ever since I built my buzz
I don't get the same love
And I told my niggas I ain't never switchin' up
Started with zero niggas, now I'm zero niggas cause
Had to get it on my own and they ain't givin' two fucks
But I got it from the mud
Got it from the mud
I got it from the mud
I got it from the mud
And nobody helped me from the start
So nobody don't gotta be a part

[Verse 1]
Fuck the other side, there's loyalty in my blood
Can't trip about designer cause I got it from the mud
Sprite dirty, Crush dirty, like I got it from the mud
I owe you, you can't get it from me so take a slug
South Side of my city and I grew up where the wars at
No school but I walked with plenty books inside my book bag
Teacher say I'ma be dead in jail with my lil ass
Now she callin' me to do a show where she book at
30K for a show, take 15 for a feature
The streets are dirty bitch gotta be hungry or they'll eat you
Gave bro 21 long distance, lawyers couldn't reach it
He ain't tryna hear it though, cause he tired of niggas preachin'

[Hook]
Ever since I built my buzz
I don't get the same love
And I told my niggas I ain't never switchin' up
Started with zero niggas, now I'm zero niggas cause
Had to get it on my own and they ain't givin' two fucks
But I got it from the mud
Got it from the mud
I got it from the mud
I got it from the mud
And nobody helped me from the start
So nobody don't gotta be a part
