[Intro]
OTF NuNu man, you know how we rockin' man, MG-03, 72nd
So you- we on the block this early?
Yeah it's 9th Street man, fool a lot of shit happened there
And I'm in my feelings at a crossroads
Don't want to go
Crossroads

[Pre-Chorus]
Meet me at the crossroads, never be lonely, meet me at the crossroads
Meet me at the crossroads, never be lonely, meet me at the crossroads
And I'm gonna miss everybody
And I'm gonna miss everybody lord
And I'm gonna miss everybody
And I'm gonna miss everybody
And I'm gonna miss everybody lord
And I'm gonna miss everybody

[Chorus]
Don't want to be lonely (meet me at the crossroads)
Don't want to be lonely (meet me at the crossroads)
Don't want to be lonely (meet me at the crossroads)
Don't want to be lonely (meet me at the crossroads)
And I'm gonna miss everybody
Capo, L'A, everybody
Nuski, Fredo, everybody
I done seen they dead bodies
And these bodies steady droppin' but you barely hear about 'em
And they can't take fear up out 'em, oh

[Verse]
Allah, we don't believe in Jesus
RIP Kenneka Jenkins
Look what they doin' to my people
Think it's funny, why they tweakin'?
They gon' snake you, they not equal
That shit with Fredo got me tweakin'
They not cryin', they just tweetin'
Ain't no time to do no grievin'
Percocet come out my pores
You don't feel that when they die 'til it happen to yours, yeah
But they got a choice
In the trenches, I done did it, I became a voice
See I ain't changed but I was goin' through changes
Pluto'd still be alive if he ain't hang with strangers
Niggas love you when you dead, that shit the strangest
Skylar and Bella my two angels
Fo'nem at your roof like a fucking reindeer
So deep inside this hellhole, it don't rain here
We love the same people, we ain't got the same tears
They don't understand me, don't think they can hear
Spread the love (we can't 'cause niggas die 'bout it)
Spread the love (this time they said I'll die 'bout it)
Spread the love (my niggas, I'll fire shots 'bout 'em)
Spread the love (too many niggas got bodied)
I'm so deep in Chicago, whoever thought I'd see France?
If I ain't have beef I think they'd be treatin' me like Chance
Old heads cannot mislead me, they know that I'm too advanced
Even though that I'm lowkey, got killers on my demand, ayy

[Outro]
You ever seen friends turn to snakes?
You ever seen snakes turn to friends?
I'm seein' this shit happen every day
That's where we at, know what I'm sayin'
We rap about it 'cause we got, know what I'm sayin'
I see people judgin' us, talkin' 'bout
They always talkin' 'bout guns, postin' guns
They doin' it for the money
See I came from shit, know what I'm sayin', so I do what I want
That's why 2Pac was so great, you feel me?
He spoke his mind
Nigga ain't gotta be no gangster
Everybody with me ain't no gangsters
You know what I'm sayin', everybody with me ain't no killers
Everybody with me don't get money
You know what I'm sayin', but we gon' make that shit work
We gon' put the money niggas with the money niggas
We gon' put the killers with the killers, know what I'm sayin'
And let it get treacherous for niggas, you know?
For real, for real
