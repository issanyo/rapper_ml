(What you got) In my Messenger bag (Gucci)
Got a bag for my bag, got a whole lotta cash
In my Messenger bag (Gucci)
Don't think a nigga lackin', keep that muthafuckin' strap
(What you got) In my Messenger bag (Gucci)
Got a bag for my bag, got a whole lotta cash
In my Messenger bag (Gucci)
Don't think a nigga lackin', keep that muthafuckin' strap

[Verse 1]
My pockets too small for all this cash on me
Had to walk into Gucci store and get a bag for it
I live a rockstar life on got some Xanax on me
Your bitch let me fuck 'cause I got a bag on me
I'm seeing all these comments on my Instagram
These pussy niggas hate 'cause they ain't got no swag
The bank teller got all that fuckin ass on her
She staring at my bag I got this cash on me (bep)

[Verse 2]
Catch me in the airport with my bag on me
TSA ask me why I got that cash on me
Paid 25 for my fuckin necklace
Paid another 25 for my Timepiece
Bitch I don't drink Dasani, I drink Fiji
Tell your bitch to wipe me down like I'm Boosie
She looking at my chain 'cause it's 3D
She looking at my bag, she wanna fuck me
