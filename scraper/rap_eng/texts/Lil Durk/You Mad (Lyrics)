(Hook) (x2)
Came up how I came up, so I guess you mad
With a car like this and a house like this, I guess you mad
With my pockets on full so I guess you mad
I live life to the fullest so I guess you mad

(Verse 1-Lil Mouse)
Came up from the bottom, so I guess you mad
Pull up in a drop-top Rari, they like who is that
VVS's in my chain, I know why you mad
Everywhere I go, they know me, ain't no who is that
Getting money on my mind, I'm so into that
If I spend some money ima get it back
Boy I'm headed to the top and I ain't looking back
Can't wear no skinny pants cuz they can't fit my racks
I'm just running to the money like a running back
Don't care nothing about it if it ain't a check
Love flexing, I just spent a sack
I'm the number 1 young stunter, I know why you mad

(Hook)
Came up how I came up, so I guess you mad
With a car like this and a house like this, I guess you mad
With my pockets on full so I guess you mad
I live life to the fullest so I guess you mad

(Verse 2-Lil Durk)
Guess you mad nigga, don't get bagged nigga
Homicide, mama crying sad nigga
Car a Jag nigga, copped the X6
Don't sip green, just sip the best shit
40 at his grill, like it's toothpaste, Crest shit
Shows a E too, after that just exit
Let's get wet shit, who pussy the wettest
I could fuck off my name and check shit
You mad, you subtweeting, you won't at shit
Dope in the cloud, big choppas in attics
.40s and macs shit, gone like magic
You ain't real so I guess I got catfished
Bitch you guessed it, bitch you guessed it
You with it, I'm with it, [?]
I call up my hittas, let's get it, let's get it (L's)
So mad, so mad
My car fast, so fast
And I'm in here with my niggas (OTF)
Ain't saying they names cuz they killas

(Hook) (x2)
Came up how I came up, so I guess you mad
With a car like this and a house like this, I guess you mad
With my pockets on full so I guess you mad
I live life to the fullest so I guess you mad
