[Lil Durk]
That shit crazy when niggas died that shit was a tragedy
I tell 'em no I can't pay for nothin' they was mad at me
Better go and get insurance life ain't guareenteed
You can't even volunteer you a felony
He just finished doing 10 don't see no more jail walls

Promise they gon' try to play you
They gon' give you max if them bitches able
Or yo' bond gon' be so high 'cause they think you Abel
Look at yo' skin, why you playin' you know them crackers hate you
Everytime you need me I tell you come and get it
Tried to cut that bond money they ain't come with it
I'ma stand ten toes like 100 dimes
I love yo' ass to death I said 100 times
