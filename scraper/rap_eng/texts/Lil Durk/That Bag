[Intro: Lil Durk]
You know what I'm sayin' we ain't  need no Instagram or no Twitter to verify a mutherfucka, you know what I'm sayin'
I'm verified from the streets nigga, for real
Turn up turn up!

[Hook: Lil Durk]
The police gon' knock on the door (Hello?)
I am not here (nah)
Money is sittin' on the floor (everywhere)
I paid for the deal
These bitches be actin' so bad
She so insecure
I'm leavin' this bitch for sure
The winter I pull out the fur (Damn!)
I need that bag
2,3 racks on just divided
I need that bag (racks!)
I'm flexin' on niggas I think I'ma buy it
I need that bag
Got more cars, more cars than a valet
I need that bag
The streets yeah the streets can't stop me

[Verse 1: OTF Ikey]
These niggas ain't harder than me
These niggas ain't smarter than me
I got my .40 on me
And it ain't hard to see
OTF we come from Chiraq, they compare us to Iraq
Where you stand you can die at
Why would you even try that?
(?) with the fans
They got max in the feds
(?) is so high
Our side on the block is so high
These niggas can't relate
The money fuck the fame
You niggas want the fame I just want the money man

Slidin' in the 'Rari feelin' like I'm in the race
My gang with me all them niggas do is gang gang
