[Verse 1: Lil Durk]
Smoke opps out a Vega, 20 a show and the these niggas can't take us
40 Ruger leave a nigga with face lifts
RIP Pluto me and him on a space ship
Told Bentley to put me on the wait list
I just copped me a chopper, that Nina my fragrance
Roc gotta mop, he addicted to maintenance
No barber, but bro Nem be taping
Fly in that Beamer with that steamer with k's
I got the Ashton and I throw up the Tre
I'm getting money, I'm stuck in my ways
Bitch, you ain't me cause I gotta get paid
Niggas be talking, got shooters like Ray
Slide in the morning do a drill, no Sway
Wanted his head gotta watch for the jakes
Niggas they bitch, they'll chill for the cake
But these bitch ass niggas so fake

[Verse 2: OTF NuNu]
These niggas be fake, gotta watch them
I’m hot, so I know they plotting
Go broke, have lil bro rob them
That Nina my problem solver
Man down, no shells, revolver
At the top but I gotta go harder
I like my lean a lil' darker
Bullet holes same size as Ms. Parker
My squad, they stay on dummy
Get back if you ain’t gettin’ no money
YSL got me straight stuntin
I’m strapped, you tweak, I’m uppin'
Cash out, make it back, it’s nothing
Red spots on his face, no blushing
These guns, they burning like Usher
My shooters gonna score at the buzzer

[Verse 3: Lil Durk]
Niggas get clapped bout rap
War time, no twitter but a nigga get clout
Clout Boyz, beg for a diss to get clout
Do a hit with 4-6, catch a opp then we out
Ring cost 30, but the watch cost 50
Ask French, cause he got at the same place for like 50
Free 5, tryna give bro 5 thats 50
Then we slide wit the 50, free 9 no 50
And we cooling with foreign
Bang Bro yo' bitch, no porn
Just made a hundred off touring
Free Rio, gave him 23 like jordan
Twenty two shotz, plus one that's Jordan
If you stupid, niggas mad cause we do this
Lil Varney he a savage and he ruthless
3hunna OTF, that’s the movement

[Verse 4: OTF NuNu]
Put a drum in a nickel
Shootas on point, and they aiming official
Blowing that tech like a ref with a whistle
My niggas they thirsty, don't pick up your dribble
Want war, we got missiles
Squad so hungry they eating a grissle
Bitch I'm the shit, I'm allergic to tissue
We savage, not civil, get money no issue
Only the family cause niggas ain't with you
Feeling myself cause I copped a new pistol
Aiki gon' blow, Rex toting on the low
Bought a lens for the scope, guns cocked for a roach
Take 'em down for the coke, Remy got it in his coat
Pound and lean, roll the dope, these niggas don't tote
Yall niggas won't blow, 400 for da goat
Broke niggas do the most, stacking bread by the loaf
Burning trees by da O, try to swim, and get soaked
