[Chorus: Lil Durk]
Ain't too many niggas out here that's gon' ride for they block
Ain't too many niggas out here that's gon' ride for they squad
But it’s niggas out here like me that’s gon' go hard
But it’s niggas out here like me that’s gon' go hard

[Verse 1: Lil Durk]
Ain't a lot of niggas out here like me that's deep in the field
Ain't a lot of niggas got deal that's gon' drill like I drill
Lost too many niggas you ain’t gon' feel like I feel
Smoking dope, pour up a fo', and I don't pop no pills
I seen lot of niggas go and tell on they mans
A hundred grand, ask about me I never took stand
We doing drills we popping in and out of 'em vans
Nigga say he on me boy don't take a chance

[Chorus: Lil Durk]
Ain't too many niggas out here that's gon' ride for they block
Ain't too many niggas out here that's gon' ride for they squad
But it’s niggas out here like me that’s gon' go hard

Late night that bitch I lurk
And all these goofy niggas looking like jerks
Smoking dope I'm off that earth

Trying to spit, have a nigga so hurt
We spit that bitch gon' squirt
Robin Jeans gotta bitch wanna flirt
Double cups with and the cups full of purp
All these scary niggas, bitch, go to church

[Chorus: Lil Durk]
Ain't too many niggas out here that's gon' ride for they block
Ain't too many niggas out here that's gon' ride for they squad
But it’s niggas out here like me that’s gon' go hard
But it’s niggas out here like me that’s gon' go hard
