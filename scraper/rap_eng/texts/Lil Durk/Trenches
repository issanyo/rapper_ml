[Intro: ? & Lil Durk]
We on our OTF shit, you heard?
TK Kravitz
Yeah
TyMadeIt

[Chorus: TK Kravitz & Lil Durk]
Got a homie in the county, he ain't tell yet
He'll never cross me 'cause he be a friend
Damn these niggas switchin' on me faster than a HellCat
And I came from nothin', 'cause I came from the trenches
Came from the trenches
Ay, came from the trenches, lil bitch

[Verse: Lil Durk]
I left my bags up in LAX, threw money at stripper bitches, never pay for sex
Poochie my bitches, Gucci, it came from sex
Eatin' food off a heater, you know we came from that
I invested my money to keep the [?] rollin'
Made big in the music, now overseas callin'
I got Booka 3 pistols for me, speed ballin'
I got 20k stuffed in these Armani jackets

[Chorus: TK Kravitz & Lil Durk]
Got a homie in the county, he ain't tell yet
He'll never cross me 'cause he be a friend
Damn these niggas switchin' on me faster than a HellCat
And I came from nothin', 'cause I came from the trenches
Came from the trenches, came from the trenches
Ay, came from the trenches, lil bitch
