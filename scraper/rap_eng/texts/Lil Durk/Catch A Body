[Chorus: Lil Durk]
Catch 'em, stank 'em, weed different flavors
Fuck the haters, I'm just gettin' paper
3 Ks like a nigga racist
I got hella choppers, I be with the robbers
I don't hang with scammers (no no), but they be around us (yeah)
And I hang with junkies, they be off the molly (yeah yeah)
I used to ride in steamers before I had a 'Rari
I used to catch attention before I caught a body

[Verse 1: OTF Ikey]
Tell me if you love me 'cause this money feel so lovely
My homie off them pills and sometime he get to buggin'
Ain't no tellin' what he'll do for a 'Rari and some money
Can't trust him, he a junkie, my niggas go Jumanji
All I ever wanted was a hundred and a bad bitch
Now we park the Phantom in the driveway, boy we mad rich
All we talk is cash shit, bricks wrapped in plastic
Seatbelts unfastened, racks on that strap shit
Granny on that trap shit, what you know about them backflips?
Ridin' 'round in a fast whip, thirty clips and a bad bitch
Percocets keep my ass lit, tell Yay keep the gas lit
OTF 'til the casket, fuck around, get your ass hit

[Chorus: Lil Durk]
Catch 'em, stank 'em, weed different flavors
Fuck the haters, I'm just gettin' paper
3 Ks like a nigga racist
I got hella choppers, I be with the robbers
I don't hang with scammers (no no), but they be around us (yeah)
And I hang with junkies, they be off the molly (yeah yeah)
I used to ride in steamers before I had a 'Rari
I used to catch attention before I caught a body

[Verse 2: Hypno Carlito]
Goddamn, hit the fuckin' man, turn up on 'em then
Couple shooters in the minivan, hit 'em then we scram
Told the bitch she can't get a chance, hit her then I vamp
Put it in, hit her from the side, make her catch a cramp
Diamonds water, boy your shit is scam, lit up like a lamp
She say I'm fine, bitch don't give me amped, beat it like a tramp
Old niggas, they just old news, in that old school
With a forty, boy don't get clapped, make the whole news
Hardcore, all I know is pain, boy I don't bruise
Mix 'em up, chopper screw his ass, call it ProTools
Fuck you mean, all I know is win, bitch I don't lose
Pick your bitch and your other ho, make 'em both choose

[Chorus: Lil Durk]
Catch 'em, stank 'em, weed different flavors
Fuck the haters, I'm just gettin' paper
3 Ks like a nigga racist
I got hella choppers, I be with the robbers
I don't hang with scammers (no no), but they be around us (yeah)
And I hang with junkies, they be off the molly (yeah yeah)
I used to ride in steamers before I had a 'Rari
I used to catch attention before I caught a body
