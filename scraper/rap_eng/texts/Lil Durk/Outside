[Chorus: Lex Aura]
Go-getter, I be outside
Fuck the weather, I be outside
I keep a couple bands on me
I had to get 'em by my lonely
Go-getter, I be outside
Fuck the weather, I be outside
I keep a couple bands on me
I had to get 'em by my lonely

[Verse 1: Mozzy]
Fettuccini fetchin', mozzarella fella
Duffle bag, quarter million cash, tryna tell 'em
We grind together, shine together, homicide together
Ratted when they caught you, like you'd rather do the time together
Sat it down briefly, gave me time to get my mind together
Takin' down amigo information, puttin' lines together
Should've took advantage, I was broke and would've signed whatever
Do it for my jurisdiction, that's who niggas tryna better
I don't even tuck the chain, bet you niggas try it never
He accomplice in the sting, bet you niggas die together
Really outside for the doughy, like never mind the weather
I be getting sick without slime, I need a pint or better

[Chorus: Lex Aura]
Go getter, I be outside
Fuck the weather, I be outside
I keep a couple bands on me
I had to get 'em by my lonely
Go getter, I be outside
Fuck the weather, I be outside
I keep a couple bands on me
I had to get 'em by my lonely

[Verse 2: Lil Durk]
Outside, I don't be cooped up in that condo
Durk who? In the streets, I'm John Doe
Money every week, I'm sendin' money off to Dede, Zoo, and Rondo
Even with this status that I got, I keep the glizzy cocked
You don't dance, well this your chance, bullets make you milly rock
I'm a Muslim with this pole, I be gettin' busy, ahk
Takin' trips up on the highway
Hope the narcs don't try and stop me
I'm a high speed, what's going on? They'll try to pop me
Ever heard that MAC sound
[?] on your background
Then you hear that clack sound
Niggas out here schemin'
In the trenches with the demons
And if I say it that I mean it

[Chorus: Lex Aura]
Go getter, I be outside
Fuck the weather, I be outside
I keep a couple bands on me
I had to get 'em by my lonely
Go getter, I be outside
Fuck the weather, I be outside
I keep a couple bands on me
I had to get 'em by my lonely

[Verse 3: Dave East]
I caught a couple licks outside, I turned Crip outside
I was taught to spray the whole strip if ain't no kids outside
If niggas couldn't find a kitchen, water whipped it outside
I'm lyin', just need a stove and I could fix about 9
I learned to fight outside, they took my bike outside
Whatever in the game, get robbed, if you shoot dice outside
Chicken wings and fried rice, I broke night outside
Fuck with these niggas, I tried, in love with these bitches, I lied
I slide like I'm on roller skates (slide)
I hear you rappin' 'bout drugs, don't know how coca taste?
Jealous niggas supposed to hate
Ain't get a chance to re-up, fuck it, I sold 'em shake
16 shots, Kobe rookie year, you holdin' 8
Eastside

[Chorus: Lex Aura]
Go getter, I be outside
Fuck the weather, I be outside
I keep a couple bands on me
I had to get 'em by my lonely
Go getter, I be outside
Fuck the weather, I be outside
I keep a couple bands on me
I had to get 'em by my lonely
