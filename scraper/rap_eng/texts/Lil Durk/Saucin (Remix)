[Intro: Bay Swag]
Yeah
Mmh-mmh
Yeah yeah yeah
Yeah (yeah)
Yeah, yeah, yeah (oh my God)

[Verse 1: Bay Swag]
You want a feature, ain't free though, yeah
I walk in Barney, no receipt though, yeah
Tell her bend her knees like a free throw
Yves Saint Laurent on my knees though
There was no way so I had to start rappin'
Daddy got locked 'cause my daddy was trappin'
They tried to say he killed a nigga in Manhattan
Jury believed the nigga that was rattin'
I'm get you out pops, swear I ain't cappin'
I was in the court, white niggas, they was laughin'
Swear this shit turned me into a savage
Stackin' it up then I count it up
Got a new chain, had to shine you up
Watch who you say your day ones, they'll line you up
Bound to go get you from jail on the flying spur
I'ma rent it, I'ma buy when the time occur

[Pre-Chorus: Bay Swag]
Yeah I swear, yeah I gotta make it out
Zoe and Josh, go and take me out
When I'm in the booth, be faded out
Daddy told me start rappin', it's the safer route

[Chorus: Bay Swag]
Pullin' up, saucin', fresher than, Colgate
If you want it, call Bay, ballin' like, Kobe
Ballin' like, all day, diamonds be, frosty
CYN, all paid, free my dad, we all pray
Pullin' up, saucin', fresher than, Colgate
If you want it, call Bay, ballin' like, Kobe
Ballin' like, all day, diamonds be, frosty
CYN, all paid, free my dad, we all pray

[Verse 2: Lil Durk]
I am not duckin' no federal law
Put in my prayer, I gotta evolve
I swear that this money be makin' me tall
Man, I hate the smell of court
Jumped in the streets I ain't really have a choice
I was so young I ain't really have a voice
First time pullin' that trigger, hand moist
Shots to the face, tell a nigga "enjoy"
Fuck the system, you told on me
And you [?] nigga shoulda fucked his sister
Head gushin' from the Glock 23
Lil nigga know he a straight pussy
What's your life without your pole
What you know about supporting your friend
And when he got life without parole
I heard you snitch like, why you snitch on the low?
Like, keep calling home like, don't nobody know
Ooh I vouch to stay real, I vouch to stay trill

[Chorus: Bay Swag]
Pullin' up, saucin', fresher than, Colgate
If you want it, call Bay, ballin' like, Kobe
Ballin' like, all day, diamonds be, frosty
CYN, all paid, free my dad, we all pray
Pullin' up, saucin', fresher than, Colgate
If you want it, call Bay, ballin' like, Kobe
Ballin' like, all day, diamonds be, frosty
CYN, all paid, free my dad, we all pray

[Outro]
Ay [?] let's count up some fetty
