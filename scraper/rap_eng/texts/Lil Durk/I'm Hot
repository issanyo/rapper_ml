[RN9 Talking]:
Came up as a youngin' man you know
Shit gotta get gwop man you know
Motherfucker ain't got that shit like that motherfucker's think they got that shit
Let's fucking end this shit foreal man you feel me
Niggas know how we coming man

[Verse 1: RondoNumbaNine]:
Coming up as a youngin' had to get gwop
In the trap on the block posted with the Glock
A hunnid cops a lot of thots and it's really hot
I came up from the bottom now I'm really hot
And bitch I'm Steve Drive you know how I rock
Blow a chop with a mop bet a nigga cop
Put a beam on a gun if a nigga fire
Blow that fucking SK you ain't gone make it far
Smoking dope off the lean with some fucking bars
Bitch Swirl got the seven he'll fucking spark
He'll send your ass to heaven if you want war
Riding deep in some Audi's off a lot of drugs
If a opp in a party fire up the club
And for my real niggas bitch I show love
I might spend a couple bands and show no grudge
Get some bricks off a lick
Rob my plug

Hook:
Coming up as a youngin' had to get gwop
In the trap on the block posted with the Glock
A hunnid cops a lot of thots and it's really hot
I came up from the bottom now I'm really hot
Now I'm really hot
I came up from the bottom now I'm really hot
Now I'm really hot
Now I'm really hot

[Verse 2: Lil Durk]:
All these niggas bitches tripping acting like we different
We be sipping keep that nickel if a nigga tripping
I got my cases if I beat them then we right back in it
Free bruh, Free Tim
They touch back down they right back in it
These niggas they hoes
These niggas they pussy get exposed
Get fifteen thou in my shows
I kill a opp nigga for my bros
That forty gone burn through his clothes
44 make a nigga move slow
Lost Rob
Lost Tae
Lost Moe
Cuff post set them up for these hoes
And these streets these streets don't play
And if he lack I'm going to hit him with the K
I'm so real
If you crack with three
I'm a running up and I'm a hit him with trey
Rich nigga shit if he stuck in his ways
Thirty shot clip will be brushing his waves(Let's Get It!)
Headshot, Headshot, Headshot, Headshot, Headshot
His face off
I seen shit like Ray Charles
Young nigga balling like J-Wall
In the bando like takeoff
Real niggas know what's up
If you get real then we in trucks
Living off deals living off clucks
Give them bucks if you broke
Then you out of luck
Let's Get It! (Squad)
