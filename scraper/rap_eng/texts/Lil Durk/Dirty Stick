[Verse 1: Lil Durk]
When you get money, they scared of you
Ain't this shit crazy, we federal
Hang around me, just to better you
And I put dope on the avenue
I'm off the gas, no edible, 25k for medical
I keep a dirty cup, I keep a dirty stick
My old head 36, went down for 30 bricks
He ain't even take his lil' dirty bitch
Disrespect is not tolerated
Give you money, I'm not obligated
Tom Ford not [?]
I see my jewelry at a round table
We was broke, we ain't had cable
Sippin' syrup like Aunt Mabel
Told 'em thank you, ain't ungrateful
If I hate you, I can't unhate you
Seem like snitchin' contagious
These niggas broke, they unable
I just brought a chopper, that bitch dirty already
I blew a bag when I'm ready, if I don't bat, I'm petty
Bitch, ain't got time for beggin', head so good, Megan
Fuck airline, jet it, bust down time, Patek
From the trenches, scary, I'ma wake up and get it

[Chrous: Lil Durk]
I keep a dirty stick
I keep a dirty stick
I keep a dirty stick
I keep a dirty stick
I keep a dirty stick
I keep a dirty stick
I keep a dirty stick
I keep a dirty stick
I keep a dirty stick
I keep a dirty stick
I keep a dirty stick
I keep a dirty stick
I keep a dirty stick
I keep a dirty stick
I keep a dirty stick
I keep a dirty stick

[Verse 2: Tee Grizzley]
Feed him somethin', he gon' turn into a leech, that's dead weight
Dirty AR pistol, hold up, dirty SK
Let the .40 with the dick bust on ya'll on camera, that's a sextape
Serial number scratched off the Glock 9, that's a fed case
Nigga keep speakin' on me, I am not worried 'bout him
Killers land on his driveway, they gon' turn up when they catch him turnin' in
A bitch told me where he stay, put his trust in a dirty bitch
Now they gonna have dinners, candle lights, 'bituaries, and some searches for him
[?] be stuck in the trenches 'cause I'm on parole
And the only time I can get out is if it's for a show
And they niggas they want my top, I can't go
So if you see me out with a top, I'm not wrong
I keep a dirty stick, Durk got like 30 sticks
Some got 50s on 'em, some got 30s in 'em
We out here purgin' wit' 'em, we is not nervous wit' 'em
This dirty stick will put you in the earth, now you a dirty nigga

[Chrous: Lil Durk]
I keep a dirty stick
I keep a dirty stick
I keep a dirty stick
I keep a dirty stick
I keep a dirty stick
I keep a dirty stick
I keep a dirty stick
I keep a dirty stick
I keep a dirty stick
I keep a dirty stick
I keep a dirty stick
I keep a dirty stick
I keep a dirty stick
I keep a dirty stick
I keep a dirty stick
I keep a dirty stick
