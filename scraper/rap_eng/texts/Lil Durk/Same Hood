[Intro]
No snake can snake me
It's like I lived this life before
Like I seen this shit happen

[Chorus]
We ain't got the same blood
We just brothers from the mud
Grew up in the same hood
And the violence so fucked up, my niggas can't judge
We gon' sleep around each other 'til we neighbor, uh
I'm just tryna wonder when this feeling of my pain stop
How you say you love me? You my brother, but gave my name up
You must be crazy thinkin' I changed up
I'd do anything, plus give my fame up
You know I'd give my fame up
You know I will never change up
You know I'm that dude, but you let a lame fuck
You know I'm that dude, but you let a lame fuck

[Verse 1]
When I be gone off the ecstasy
Shorty, she gon' get the best of me (Let's get it)
And she know I be with killers
Her family is not accepting me (My gang, gang)
I nutted all in her and left, I told her I got a vasectomy (Yeah)
While them niggas get to at-ing me
Said they catchin' me, they stretchin' me (Grrrah)
Warnin' me, watchin' my back
They know I be gone off the medicine (Gang, gang)
My cousin had died on the cam
The police got footage and edit it (Big facts)
On God, I can't get shit snatched
Can't leave, I need that, give it back
Fuck shot, I need you kidnapped
Surprise, that Glock come gift-wrapped
I tatted all my dead homies in my skin (My skin, yeah, yeah)
Told them crackers on them B Airways they need yo' pen (Yeah, yeah)
Gulp a cup of my lean to wash off my sins (On God)
Made my tri-state hoes buy me all my Timbs

[Chorus]
We ain't got the same blood
We just brothers from the mud
Grew up in the same hood
And the violence so fucked up, my niggas can't judge
We gon' sleep around each other 'til we neighbor, uh
I'm just tryna wonder when this feeling of my pain stop
How you say you love me? You my brother, but gave my name up
You must be crazy thinkin' I changed up
I'd do anything, plus give my fame up
You know I'd give my fame up
You know I will never change up
You know I'm that dude, but you let a lame fuck
You know I'm that dude, but you let a lame fuck

[Verse 2]
Yo homie said they on me, I be with killas and parolees
The niggas police, I know they name-drop
You be rappin' 'bout that trap, but you ain't never sold nothin'
I hold a grudge back in '09, you ain't let me hold nothin'
You cheat on me, I swear I'll beat you like you stole somethin'
Pillow talkin' to these hoes, yeah, you cold-blooded
How you follow me on the 'Gram and you don't like pics?
I fucked a bitch, she like her girl, she don't like dick
Cum on my nice sheets, they don't like this
Bad bitch a Pisces, I keep a nightstick
I swear I'm at my nicest, been through my crisis
We not to be played with, they on that night shift
Niggas tryna stick me up like I ain't never showed no love
That petty shit let go, I told you I ain't got no grudge
I don't give no fuck, addicted to these drugs
When I was down and gone, them niggas ain't send me nothin'
See red, I ain't fuckin' with 'Tussin, bite down, I'm bustin'
Shoot first, you clutch, you mad I pressed yo' button
You know we read yo' mind, my niggas ain't duckin'
You know you play with mine, ain't no discussion

[Chorus]
We ain't got the same blood
We just brothers from the mud
Grew up in the same hood
And the violence so fucked up, my niggas can't judge
We gon' sleep around each other 'til we neighbor, uh
I'm just tryna wonder when this feeling of my pain stop
How you say you love me? You my brother, but gave my name up
You must be crazy thinkin' I changed up
I'd do anything, plus give my fame up
You know I'd give my fame up
You know I will never change up
You know I'm that dude, but you let a lame fuck
You know I'm that dude, but you let a lame fuck
