[Hook]
Playing with Glocks that was a sport
Momma told me to get back on that porch
Had no money, trap house slow
Robbing and hustling was so important
Niggas was telling, feds in motion
Everything they doing was being recorded
Fed taking pictures and we posing
Hopping in and out of them Porsches
Yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Jumped off the porch
(all my niggas they so real)
I been jumped off the porch
(all my niggas they'll kill)
I been jumped off the porch
(tell my niggas it's a drill)
I been jumped off the porch

[Verse 1]
I was down when the war was strong
They told us chill out
Half sleep when the sheriffs came ( sorry momma )
They told us get out
It was a drought, I had a doubt
Me, I was sleeping on my homie couch
Had to wake up with this crack in my mouth
Heard his mommas telling me to get out
Caught me a case
Bitches be on me because I'm the new Ye
This is my city where killers don't play
Gotta keep killers around where you lay
Link card cut short she on public aid
Everybody left but my niggas stay
Before we was raided
We was killing these roaches with raid
My niggas was killing for J's
RIP to Nuski Bae
We miss you
Same L's, same blood, same tissue
We killing any niggas that diss
I was playing with them Glocks

Had no money, trap house slow
Robbing & hustling was so damn important

Hopping in and out of them Porsches
Yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Jumped off the porch
