[Intro]
Let's go!

[Hook]
Robin jeans on me

Bad bitches wanna turn up, they dancin' all for me
Went to the act, she know it's all for me
She give me top then she do the squats 'cause everything for free
All molly sweat gang, geek the shit extra
1, 2, 3, 4 shots, now you ain't stressed
V line goin' up, told lil' girl not to stretch it
Feds see me all on kell d, I tell 'em (?)

[Verse]
Pourin' money, I'm pourin' money
Fake nigga just showin' money
Everything I want gotta be new-new, no low-low
