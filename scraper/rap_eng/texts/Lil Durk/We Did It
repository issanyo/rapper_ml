[Intro: Omelly]
I get it, we get it
Yeah!
OTL nigga!
Osama twin lammas!
All that shit y'all niggas be talk 'bout, man we already did that

[Hook: Omelly]
We did it, we did it
Cooking work up on the stove
We did it, we did it
Fucking bitches, getting dough
We did it, we did it
Turning up with my bros
We did it, we did it
Outchea doin' what we supposed'
We did it, we did it
We love money, never told
We did it, we did it
Love the life that we chose
We did it, we did it
Turning up with my bros

[Verse 1: Omelly]
Fuck them niggas, man they do the most
Never lacking, gotta keep my toast
Y'all was walking 'round, naked broke
I was hand to hand with the coke
Chopper on me floating, I'm on the back seat-
I'm about to hop out and [?] this shit, watch niggas run like a track [?]
Me and my nigga [?] in designer clothes
Cookin' clips dropped [?]
You got to get up on them niggas, hit 'em up close
100 real niggas get the utmost
Only real killers get the utmost
Only real dealers get the utmost
You out here sellin' bricks, you get the utmost
Never told never snitched, you get the utmost
Handling your bitch, you get the utmost
Taking care of your kids, you get the utmost
In the kitchen whippin', got a mean arm
Give me couple minutes then the works done
Cookin' crack up in the kitchen
Hittin' numbers, shit I did it
On my hammer bakin' soda, Pyrex the vision
Nigga we did it!

[Hook: Omelly]
We did it, we did it
Cooking work up on the stove
We did it, we did it
Fucking bitches, getting dough
We did it, we did it
Turning up with my bros
We did it, we did it
Outchea doin' what we supposed'
We did it, we did it
We love money, never told
We did it, we did it
Love the life that we chose
We did it, we did it
Turning up with my bros

[Verse 2: Lil Durk]
Celebrate with a pint of high tech
Couple cars notes around my neck
Heard your baby momma she a [?]
Fuck around and you know I hit
Omelly boy, this is my shit
No deal til we fly private
Boy we litty forever, ain't no dry shit
How you savage and you dry snitch
Make me bring .6 out

Bitches sucking dick now
Broke boy sit down
Boy I'm so rich now
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I ain't with that fly shit, I get fly shit
Hype bitch, trap outta [?]
Now my diamonds [?]
10 toes [?] you might switch
Look at my diamonds, hit the light switch
Ran from the plug twelve times
They say that I'm flight risk, they don't wanna believe me no more
I'm at the top, they won't leave me no more
I make it easy some more

[Hook: Omelly]
We did it, we did it
Cooking work up on the stove
We did it, we did it
Fucking bitches, getting dough
We did it, we did it
Turning up with my bros
We did it, we did it
Outchea doin' what we supposed'
We did it, we did it
We love money, never told
We did it, we did it
Love the life that we chose
We did it, we did it
