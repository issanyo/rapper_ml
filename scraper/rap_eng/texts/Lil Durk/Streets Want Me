[Chorus: Lil Durk]
Put down savages, picked up vultures (vultures)
When you pop that's when they want you (want you)
You turn your head they gon' dome you (dome you)
Just for thinkin' they your homie (homie)
New G-Wagon by my lonely (skrt skrt skrt)
I'm just smokin' by my lonely (by my lonely)
Percocet fuck up my colon (up my colon)
It's crazy how the streets want me (want me)
The streets want me, I'm signed to the streets
(The streets want me)
The streets want me, I'm signed to the streets
(The streets want me)
The streets want me, I'm signed to the streets (to the streets)
They want me, I'm signed to the streets (let's get it)

[Verse 1: Lil Durk]
Grew my dreads back, label me a menace
She want xanax, gotta swallow penis
You ain't no bag yet, you ain't got no fifties, that's them drums
Them stripper hoes gon' talk about you if you don't throw no ones
I'ma keep a couple of mine 'cause we don't throw no guns
How the fuck you gon' go to war with me when you ain't got no funds
Shit get risky with you when you ain't got no conscious
You should see that AP face, I got it polished
Pour up syrup
Serve on the first
Swerve in the vert, put Rollie
The money is first
Ain't doing no verse
Lil B give 'em the curse

[Chorus: Lil Durk]
Put down savages, picked up vultures (vultures)
When you pop that's when they want you (want you)
You turn your head they gon' dome you (dome you)
Just for thinkin' they your homie (homie)
New G-Wagon by my lonely (skrt skrt skrt)
I'm just smokin' by my lonely (by my lonely)
Percocet fuck up my colon (up my colon)
It's crazy how the streets want me (want me)
The streets want me, I'm signed to the streets
(The streets want me)
The streets want me, I'm signed to the streets
(The streets want me)
The streets want me, I'm signed to the streets (to the streets)
They want me, I'm signed to the streets (let's get it)

[Verse 2: MoneyBagg Yo]
I don't got goons, I got hitters
I'm with some dope boys and some killers, yeah
She act petty when I don't feel her
I cut her off like the umbilical (what's that?) cord
The kushy that I'm blowing it hit hard like Floyd
I come from the trenches, now I'm making noise
The streets love me, they know I keep that heat
The streets signed me, I got what they need (federal)
They wasn't lettin' no cut on it
Glock nineteen, it's tucked on me
Caught you so I clutch on it
Told my plug to rush on it
Fly paper, she stuck on me
She want a Birkin bag
She pulled up in a purple Jag
Bumpin' Durk and Bagg

[Chorus: Lil Durk]
Put down savages, picked up vultures (vultures)
When you pop that's when they want you (want you)
You turn your head they gon' dome you (dome you)
Just for thinkin' they your homie (homie)
New G-Wagon by my lonely (skrt skrt skrt)
I'm just smokin' by my lonely (by my lonely)
Percocet fuck up my colon (up my colon)
It's crazy how the streets want me (want me)
