[Hook]
I've been catchin' all this violence lately
I've been catchin' all the sneak diss
I've been sippin' on this act lately
Drinkin' so much that I pee different
Lately (Put a perc inside a Piña colada)
Lately (I'm in the trap i8 pickin' up the Phantom)
Lately (I love my niggas like blood but yeah we brothers)
Lately (And I could never put no one above 'em)

[Verse 1]
Bein' fake the new real, that's why the world polluted
I did shit for every nigga in that system losin' (Let's get it)
They set me up for fraud, how much I Westerned Unioned?
I told my jeweler that we good and went and copped a cuban
I know some bitches from the city yeah I talk about 'em (yeah yea)
I lost some niggas back to back now and they safe around me (yeah)
And this shit gotta be real 'cause I don't pay for families (Let's get it)
I'm from the jungle where them killas go ape about me (rrah)
How they blame me 'cause I'm trill and nothin' fake about me (Let's get it)
How they blame me 'cause I'm off the pills and I wrecked the Audi
In the field all day ask Rex about me (Let's get it)
'Posed to been my brother nigga why you textin' 'bout me? (Sneak dissin')

Bitch you gon' die for the cash (Cash)
'Cause my name on it you wanna smash (Smash)
In the streets I'm forever blessed
In the streets I'm forever stamped (Let's get it)
Diamonds on me they water water
Rob me 'cause a ambulance (rrah)
Headshot call the ambulance
Balmain we ain't sharing pants (Balmain)
Tell the industry to let us in (Fuck 'em)
Tell the traphouse to let us in (Fuck 'em!)
Wouldn't trade for 100 bands (Lord)
Rather be around 100 brothers than to be around 100 friends (100 friends)
Choppa make 'em do the running man (Gang!)
Give me a cup I'ma overpour
Bitch I'm 300 forever glory (yeah)
Couple killas they forever scorin'

Gang gang what I stand for (gang gang)
Real niggas what I stand for (real)
My baby momma she a fan boy
Kicked her out like a landlord
