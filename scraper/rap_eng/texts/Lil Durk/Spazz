[Intro]
D. Brooks Exclusive

[Chorus]
We took hella losses
Sat at the round table with hella bosses
I had to leave niggas alone who double-crossed me
Take care the situation if you cross me, uh
You know I just wanna spazz
You know I need money fast
All blue cheese, I need my cash
Play with me then that's your ass, yeah
Bro 'nem be trippin', they smokin' on gas, yeah
Nigga be sneaky, he smoke his own guys, yeah
If he do, don't be surprised, yeah
Looked the devil in his eyes

[Verse 1]
Two or three chokers, I'm chokin' myself
You want a handout, you lookin' for help
Your son be watchin' you, he tryna take your steps
He wanna be just like you, he hope you don't get killed, yeah yeah
I might finger your bitch with a three point ring
We up on the opps on a ten point lead
I'm for real about it
Niggas 'round me, I'll kill about 'em
I told Pluto I can't live without him
Now I gotta live without him
These niggas finesse, they come around, I need two, three pills out 'em
I know three niggas fucked up, locked up, they need like three bills out you
You told a bitch you gon' kill me, I don't know how to feel around you
You know he told, his heart is cold, and he still around you
You'd give them niggas anything and they still'll down you
I'll give my family anything to keep 'em smiling
Bitch-made, bitch-made, snitch K, snitch K
I be hopin' for them better days
Cash out, nigga, fuck good grades
No mics
She say I can't get nothin' 'til I better my grades
I won't say no no more, I'ma give you anything when I better my ways
Every time when I see my brothers ride past, I throw up the treys
My brothers get on your ass, you grass, niggas can't be saved

[Chorus]
We took (Turn up), hella losses
Sat at the round table with hella bosses
I had to leave niggas alone who double-crossed me
Take care the situation if you cross me, uh
You know I just wanna spazz
You know I need money fast
All blue cheese, I need my cash
Play with me then that's your ass, yeah
Bro 'nem be trippin', they smokin' on gas, yeah
Nigga be sneaky, he smoke his own guys, yeah
If he do, don't be surprised, yeah
Looked the devil in his eyes

[Verse 2]
I just brought a watch, I put the carats in
SSR, RIP Fredo, died off medicine
I can shoot you in your head, step in my residence
If you don't talk to me face-to-face, you better not at me then
Just off my labels, I had two plaques, that's a million
Always in trouble, devil on me, can't prevent it
They get that call, they on that corner, then they bendin'
If they don't fuck for who I am, she fuck for Remy
She suck my dick, ooh ooh, my bad, I mean my jimmy
I say my bad, can't talk like that, my kid be listenin'
I just put like fifty racks in my Amiri jeans
They had me questioned for somebody, didn't tell 'em anything
Ooh, I ain't tell 'em nothin'
If you did then your head is gushin'
My lifestyle, you can't rush it
You ain't gon' shoot, stop clutchin'
Sad to say what my niggas'll do for that money

[Chorus]
We took hella losses
Sat at the round table with hella bosses
I had to leave niggas alone who double-crossed me
Take care the situation if you cross me, uh
You know I just wanna spazz
You know I need money fast
All blue cheese, I need my cash
Play with me, then that's your ass, yeah
Bro 'nem be trippin', they smokin' on gas, yeah
Nigga be sneaky, he smoke his own guys, yeah
If he do, don't be surprised, yeah
