[Intro]
Damn to this day nigga still pray on my down fall
You can't deny good music or a real nigga
For real for real

[Hook]
I used to break in the crib
Now I got a safe in the crib
Chiraq crime rate build
So it ain't safe at the crib
I just want money forever
Told 'em that's how I'ma live
Shootings and murders I seen
I ain't never say I did it
As a kid growin' up
As a kid growin' up
As a kid growin' up
I done seen a lot of shit
As a kid growin' up
As a kid growin' up
As a kid growin' up
I done did a lot of shit

[Verse 1]
I done seen how you shootin' niggas
Now I see right through people
Three years of my life to them people
Judge labeled me a menace
I'm Mike Brown to these people
I gotta ride around with my heater
Police killing my people
Overseas cause I'm legal
I ain't takin' no chances
Masks on for them cameras
On my own, no advances
Broken homes for advances
As a kid growin' up
I used to be poured up
I ain't never froze up
All I know is drill drill
Put him on a poster
Reward money for the killer
They ain't never found the killer
Don't nobody know nothin'
I rob niggas for they tool
Brought guns up in school
Started a war, gotta move
Free Nine, boy let 'em loose (Ls)

[Hook]
I used to break in the crib

Chiraq crime rate build
So it ain't safe at the crib
I just want money forever
Told 'em that's how I'ma live
Shootings and murders I seen
I ain't never say I did it
As a kid growin' up
As a kid growin' up
As a kid growin' up
I done seen a lot of shit
As a kid growin' up
As a kid growin' up
As a kid growin' up
I done did a lot of shit

[Verse 2]
Put a nigga on the news
I'm in traffic with the tool
Three cases, I'ma fool
Gave my life to a Jew
It's in the hand of a Jew
Shooters took him on a cruise
Streets see how I roll
I'm still tryna get Zoo
Still chasing them millions
Daddy gave me the wisdom
Twenty-three years up in prison
I swear I seen his vision
Seen my son, I start tearin'
I took the game, wasn't given
Ditched school, hit the hood
The streets love me, I'm good
Shed tears if I could
Shed blood if I could
Share money if I could
Share guns if I could
Sell coke if I could
Sell dope if I could
I'd rob if I could
I'm gettin' money cause I could (Ls)

As a kid growin' up
As a kid growin' up
As a kid growin' up
I done seen a lot of shit
As a kid growin' up
As a kid growin' up
As a kid growin' up
I done did a lot of shit
