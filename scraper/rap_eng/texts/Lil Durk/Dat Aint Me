[Intro: Tink]
Man dat shit ain't me
Man dat shit ain't me
Man dat shit ain't me
Man dat shit ain't me

[Chorus: Tink]
I can never fall in love
Man dat shit ain't me
Fuck I look like holding my tongue
Man dat shit ain't me
Switch it up, dropping names
Man dat shit ain't me
Say his new girlfriend so lame
Cause dat bitch ain't me
But I'm me tho, yeah nigga I'm me tho
Cruising while I'm pilling
This shit come from Puerto Rico
I can never fall in love
Man dat shit ain't me
Fuck I look like holding my tongue
Man dat shit ain't me

[Verse 1: Tink]
Lot of niggas fake, and I show em' no love
I keep it real, so I stand out
Like I'm banned from the club
You in line for that paper
While I'm cutting like razors
That money calling
These bitches still walking round with pagers
It's something wrong with that
I'm lifting, where's my check pad
Don' broke so many trees down
That I should be a Lumberjack
I should be on TMZ, the way I'm spazzing out tho
These fake niggas playing both sides
They in the middle that's an Altoid
But man I'm international
Don't fuck with snakes, like Samuel
Jackson, with that action
She talkin', talkin' like a fraction
I break it down, make em' buss it
Tell Durk to come throw some hunnids
We right here, you on the sideline
I pass you up just like a timeline
Lil' nigga

[Chorus: Tink]

[Verse 2: Lil Durk]
Coolin' with shake, man dat shit ain't me
Gotta pay me for a verse, man dat shit ain't free
I never wife a thot, man dat shit ain't me
And I'm cruisin' in a drop
Bitch it's me and Tink
And I'm rolling, rolling
Overseas, my cars they foreign
These broke ass niggas, they borin'
Don't pay em no attention, ignorance
All my niggas they hot, they scorchin'
That ghost got a nigga hearin' voices
Tru Religion, I love my horses (Tru)
Them horses, I love my foreign
My bitch she bad, she diking
I make your main bitch, like it
I keep my gun on fightin'
In the condo, on my bright lit
That money got a bitch excited
That shit ain't mean no wifin'(she don't)
That money got a bitch excited
That shit ain't mean no wifin' (ooh)

[Chorus: Tink]
