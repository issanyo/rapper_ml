[Chorus: Lil Durk]
My nigga had crossed me and I say I forgive him
I love him like he family so I'm stuck in the middle
I really wanna drill him and say fuck it and kill him
And treat him like a crook, like he was never a member
I done seen niggas make it out of poverty
I done seen drug money flips of property
I done seen close niggas say they robbing me
I done seen
I done seen

[Verse 1: Lil Durk]
Been strapped up in them corners, niggas is really informers
I'ma sip lean in the morning, I get the head in the morning
Niggas could never come beat us, so niggas gone come and try join us
You can't come around, my shooters got a hundred rounds
And they smoking out a lot of pounds
And you rappers still underground
Niggas not big enough, these niggas not hearing us
These niggas so serious, my shooters Nigeria
My wrist Siberia, these niggas be fearing us
I gotta level up, gotta get my bezel up
Slow down and better up, et cetera, et cetera
Nuski had that SIG, I swear, yes he did
These niggas act like 12, man I swear they pigs

[Chorus: Lil Durk]
My nigga had crossed me and I say I forgive him
I love him like he family so I'm stuck in the middle
I really wanna drill him and say fuck it and kill him
And treat him like a crook, like he was never a member
I done seen niggas make it out of poverty
I done seen drug money flips of property
I done seen close niggas say they robbing me
I done seen
I done seen

[Verse 2: Yung Tory]
I'm finna cop me a foreign, I gave you niggas a warning
You niggas be telling I know it, I heard you fuck with the boys
I done seen a lot of shit, but I ain't making no noise
They love how a young nigga move, that nigga he always on point
I'm just a young nigga, I done seen it all
Never had shit, i just wanna ball
You was my nigga, but these niggas fraud
When you in trouble, who you gonna call?
You was my nigga (yah)
Niggas switching up, only the family I trust
I don't show a nigga no love
Nah boy, I never knew ya
Free brodie, he the shoota
I'm in the studio cooking
I fuck on your bitch and she tooken

[Chorus: Lil Durk]
My nigga had crossed me and I say I forgive him
I love him like he family so I'm stuck in the middle
I really wanna drill him and say fuck it and kill him
And treat him like a crook, like he was never a member
I done seen niggas make it out of poverty
I done seen drug money flips of property
I done seen close niggas say they robbing me
I done seen
I done seen
