[Hook: Lil Durk]
I be with the killas, I be by myself
I be getting money, I be by myself
I stay in designer, I be by myself
It ain't hard to find me, I be by myself
I be by myself (x12)

[Verse 1: Lil Reese]
I be by myself
I be by myself
But I be with my niggas, I don't need no help
Tote it by myself, We don't need no help
Ratting and snitching is bad for yo health
Fucking around man that boy gon get left
Guns in the attic and pills on the shelf
Got 3hunna with me, O'block and who else?
Fucking this bitch and I dove in like Phelps
Load up the chopper, I don't need no help
Pouring up lean and it's bad for my health
Smoking this loud and it's bad for my health
He ain't coming right then he gots to get left
He ain't coming right then he might just get left
First 48, watch he tell on himself
First 48, watch he tell on himself
And that shit right there, keep me right by myself
And that shit right there, keep me right by myself
Just hit me a lick, spent that shit on myself
Just hit me a lick, spent that shit on myself
My first fifty thou, spend that shit on myself.

[Verse 2: Lil Durk]
I'm a killa, I'm that nigga
All my niggas they gon feel it
All these niggas talk on twitter
Chain gang, shining like a pot of glitter
I be so solo, ridin' out with the thirty
Yeah I be dolo, thirty thousand cash, yeah I'm a A-hole
Gotta lay low cause these niggas is fufu
Playing both sides, acting like Brasco
Black Rick Owens, I stay in designer
Word on the block, Louie gon find us
Shout out all my niggas, I had to go sign 'em
Had to cosign 'em, buy yellow diamonds
Same color lemon, talking cases on these tracks
You a snitchin', but I can't mention
Come around and I do for attention
3K nazi, had to go [?]
Bitch I'm an immaculate, I'ma go cray
I'm chasing these Benjamin's, piss on they graves
War for niggas hate, can't escape, 38
Thirty shots grizzlies like Bathing Apes
Run up on his ass, red tape
