[Intro: Lil Durk]
Doodie Lo
Sonic
Booka the shooter
Mikey are you with me, he gon' shoot you
Davis, drop that bitch

[Chorus: Lil Durk]
Play your role, cocaine, play with your nose
You act like bro ain't told, he ain't stick to the code
Tried to keep your pistol with you, tell you we don't need no nigga
My gang can't get no realer, my gang is too official, yeah yeah
Homi, on me (let's get it, let's get it)
Apartments, two palm trees
A homi, yeah, 'bout me
A brewfurd can't be 'round me (let's get it)

[Verse 1: Booka600]
Discard her, put her on her knees
Straight from the trenches, been to Beverly
Toted extends, case a felony
My niggas missin', you see them at me
Go play your roll but don't play with me
We play for keeps, gang played with keys
So don't snitch on the low, hang with a snitch on the low
Lot of my brothers got clothes, won't never let a nigga play goals
Ain't never let a nigga get close to us, this 'K we gon' expose
Get the ropes, that's for his close ones
Chopper close, it gon' for once
Chopper gon' expose his guts

[Chorus: Lil Durk]
Play your role, cocaine, play with your nose
You act like bro ain't told, he ain't stick to the code
Tried to keep your pistol with you, tell you we don't need no nigga
My gang can't get no realer, my gang is too official, yeah yeah
Homi, on me (let's get it, let's get it)
Apartments, two palm trees
A homi, yeah, 'bout me
A brewfurd can't be 'round me (let's get it)

[Verse 2: Doodie Lo]
My gang too official, say fuck it, don't need no niggas
Free the guys out the system, OTF, we them niggas
My brothers they don't fold, I know some niggas that done told
It done made my heart cold, below temp, it is froze
I took his bitch for nothin', I had to run through a check
We now, fuck next, this lifestyle I'm blessed
Good gas no stress, cop killers do flesh
Wanna be gang, catch a body, that's how you pass the test
Get from 'round me, tryna down me
Put some money on your head, that's a bounty
Just sent my lil brother some bread in the county
And it's only gang gang members around me, yeah

[Chorus: Lil Durk]
Play your role, cocaine, play with your nose
You act like bro ain't told, he ain't stick to the code
Tried to keep your pistol with you, tell you we don't need no nigga
My gang can't get no realer, my gang is too official, yeah yeah
Homi, on me (let's get it, let's get it)
Apartments, two palm trees
A homi, yeah, 'bout me
A brewfurd can't be 'round me (let's get it)

[Verse 3: Lil Durk & OTF Ikey]
Bando shootin' them craps, neighborhood full of them rats, c'mon
Ain't no word of mouth, young nigga spittin' them facts, turn up
Why you tell? Why you snitch? (c'mon)
Mad as hell, we gettin' rich (yeah-yeah)
Mikey Ike, shooter
Catch a body, do you
Run up on 'em, booyah booyah
It ain't too many niggas out here that's not fuckin' with us
Tryna see my baby, she ain't fuckin' with us
Don't want no lames around me that be fakin' with me
I be with my gang forever, they be with me
I wake up gettin' money 'cause I gotta get it
Fuck relationship goals, I gotta get a million

[Chorus: Lil Durk]
Play your role, cocaine, play with your nose
You act like bro ain't told, he ain't stick to the code
Tried to keep your pistol with you, tell you we don't need no nigga
My gang can't get no realer, my gang is too official, yeah yeah
Homi, on me (let's get it, let's get it)
Apartments, two palm trees
A homi, yeah, 'bout me
A brewfurd can't be 'round me (let's get it)
