[Hook:]
Niggas wanna see me fall, but I ain't trippin'
I ain't trippin', grain grippin', stay drippin'
I be dealin'. Fuck 'em all, but I ain't trippin'
Ride dippin', got your main piece all up on my line trippin'
All we do is smoke, all you do is talk
Fresh up out the kitchen, got it smellin' a vault
Got 'em yellin' like yeah, all this money over here..
Coke boys we on it

[Verse 1: Lil' Durk]
OTF and Coke Boys. Y'all niggas don't make no noise
500 for my shirt boy, t-these niggas some broke boys
They ain't ringin', I'm cashin' out
A lot of hoes, I could pass em out
Rose with Ace of Spade. Hundred dollar bottles, I could pass 'em out
Your bitch give me that Facetime. Ferragamo my waist line
Pop-pop bitch, I can't waste time. Rollie on my wrist I spare time
I get mine, I get mine. Fuck a hater nigga, I get mine
I get mine, I get mine. Fuck a hatin' bitch, I get mine
Fresh-fresh out the kitchen, these-these niggas bitches
I-I ride what I live, ride-ride what I witness
Flexin' and I'm finessin'. That bag I got, I checkin'
We don't do no talkin' cause where I'm from we winnin'. Turn Up

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Chinx]
Room 4 and that coupe roll. We on 24's and we cruisin'
No loop holes, my crew balls. Got 2 hoes and they choosin'
But Nuvo, I do shows. We group hoes and you losin'
Posted up with my fools, gettin' high we just foolin'
Thang sittin' on them Ashanti's, 30 racks on my time piece
Don't act like you don't see that pistol sittin' right side me
More drank, more bitches. More drank, more bitches
Hoppin' out on 'em. Ho please no pictures
I rep coke boys in my sleep, new and old schools in my fleet
I be so smooth when I creep, got your ho groovin' to my beat
Youngin' out that window lettin' that chopper off
At the top spot till we knock em off!
