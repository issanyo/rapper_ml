[Intro]
Dun De-e-e-e-al

[Chorus: Lil Durk]
I talked to [?], he in a hole
I can't let you hold no money, you in a hole
I love my brothers, I don't love no ho
And all the bitch ways that shit gon' show
Got some savages they on the go
Got my ku-ku gang they on the go
My brother and them they all on go
I'm just tryna let them know

[Verse 1: Lil Durk]
Run up on ya block, you ain't did shit
Shot your homie, you ain't did shit yet
Fuck with me, they gon' kill shit
Calling my phone ain't get through yet
Dope, coke sold in the projects
Want twenty for a duece of the Hi-Tech
Headshot, that nigga ain't die yet
Couple hundred thou' in the mansion
Police comin' gotta flush it
It take a six ainâ€™t gotta touch it
Bitches ask me for a purse
Baggin' bitches they the worstest
I was taught up on the come up
Police comin' put the gun up
Hopin' niggas never run up
Police too too hot
I was out takin' risks
L1 steak with some crispies
Pillow talkin' to the bitches
That'll get you shot
I was grabbin' bare skin
'Cause these bitches too hot
Deny a nigga today
Bitch, no tomorrow
Skeleton Audemars
Focusin', Adderall
Millionaire when I was twenty
I can go and buy the mall
Niggas actin' too fishy for me
Percocet when it hit the stomach
Niggas say that they gettin' Vernie
Niggas know that we gettin' money
Lookin' for war, we ain't runnin' from it
When we get bored we count hunnid, hunnids
We hit the floor when the police comin'
Swallow drugs in my tummy, tummy
You ain't got no job, Tommy, Tommy
Durkio bitch I'm so enormous
Walked through, cost this and that
Ain't even gotta do a performance

[Chorus: Lil Durk]
I talked to [?], he in a hole
I can't let you hold no money, you in a hole
I love my brothers, I don't love no ho
And all the bitch ways that shit gon' show
Got some savages they on the call
Got my coo-coo gang they on the call
My brother and them they all on go
I'm just tryna let them know

[Verse 2: Lil Durk]
Cold ass shots, he dead, 30 Glock, FN
Why you play with the dead, overdose off the meds
You too close to the feds, don't play with my kids
Take me instead, niggas goin' out sad
Can't go outside, hang out that ride
If I'ma go to jail, my niggas gon' ride
Not gay but got pride, raise, cock, and blast
If your man died, don't be surprised
For you I'd take a bullet, boy
In the A on the boulevard
For you, I'd take the charge
Trust you, let down my guard
Back then my car ain't start
Now my car push to start
We can't go broke no more
We sellin' fentanyl
In that Wraith kiss the stars
That lil' bitch pissed me off
Shout out them burglar boys
They comin' to get it all
That dope like black cars
He tough, he act hard
That weed is backyard
He a finesser
You do not ride with no pistol
Opposition tryna get you
Bitch, I'm a dog like a shih tzu
Run up a check to go get [?]
One of my niggas smoke crystals
And I'm thinking he official
Drugs tearin' up his tissues
Why you takin' those chemicals
My son and my daughter identical
The forty the nine Glock identical
All of my diamonds, they water, they swimming pool
You stole my swag, it's like I invented you
Christian Dior, Christian Loub, Chanel tennis shoes
You feet could hide no bones in 'em, you can't fit my shoes
Been through a lot as a young nigga, you can't fix my screws
Even though you pick and chose, bitch you pick to lose
My brothers over you, bitch ain't shit confused
Turn up

[Chorus: Lil Durk]
I talked to [?], he in a hole
I can't let you hold no money, you in a hole
I love my brothers, I don't love no ho
And all the bitch ways that shit gon' show
Got some savages they on the call
Got my coo-coo gang they on the call
My brother and them they all on go
I'm just tryna let them know
