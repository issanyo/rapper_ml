Fuck niggas want to bang with us
Keep playin', get your head popped
Your body drop when the leg pop

Yeah bitch, that's a house
Niggas tough on the internet
In person they quiet like mouse

Had them shooters laying on your house
When them shots get to hit your stomach
You gon' hold that shit like a pouch
Boom, you gon' hold that shit like a pouch
Yeah nigga we the mob
Watch what's comin' out your mouth
Bitch, look at my cars

Lot of racks on my squad
Bitch, look at the garage
Let's have us a menage
Let's look at these hearts
Got a lot of money, on god
Bleedin' no bandage, on god
Ice on froze, unthaw
Dice shootin' dice on your boy
Pivot, long socks, young boss
Droptop Phantom, living large
Droptop talkin' to the god
Got a new panoramic for the Porsche

[Verse 2: Young Thug]
Bitch, look at my cars

Ice on froze, unthaw
Dice shootin' dice on your boy
Pivot, long socks, young boss
Droptop Phantom, living large
Droptop talkin' to the god
Got a new panoramic for the Porsche

[Verse 3: Lil Durk]
I fuck with the gang, I be with the rods
I fuck with the mob, my killers be robbin'
These rappers is targets, the plug's a target
You police, you sorry
I put my guns in apartments
We run a train on your BM
And she be all in my DM
You stomp 'em out in some weak Timbs
You know what it is when we see him
Headshot, boy you test me
We in Miami on jet skis
Hairpin trigger, don't test these
Rich nigga had a shootout in a Bentley
