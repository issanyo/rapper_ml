[Pre-Hook: Lil Durk]
Cut that music off, I ain't wit' other shit (I'm tryna turn up)
I ain't tryna chill baby, I'm wit that fuckin' shit (I'm tryna turn up)
You came for me, well I came from nothin', shit (I'm tryna turn up)
You ain't fuckin' with me , then who you fuckin' with?

[Hook: Lil Durk]
I'm just tryna, tryna, tryna, tryna (turn up)
All this money, I'm just really tryna (turn up)
With the gang, and I'm really tryna (turn up)
This my city, and I'm tryna tryna (turn up)

[Verse 1: Lil Durk]
How many licks do it take till you get to the center of her mouth?
She geekin', she tweakin' we turnt up we got it, we all in the pot
KOD, QOD, Magic,  we fuckin the sacks up in five
Gas and mud I be off the drugs, don't touch
I'm feelin' a little cocky
They ring any bitches wanna fuck now
Pop bottles like I won a fuckin' touchdown
If you sober, scoot over, I do drugs now
Party prolly got me all in the clubs now
Pour some lean with no coco, we rockin' rollies, no JoJo
And we off the drinks so slow mo, I get twenty a show, no promo
Bitches get naked and do it for the Vine
So she gon' turn up and do it for the guys
She sippin' on Henny, she mix it wit' Remy
She suckin' on me while I pull on her Remy
She shy like the city but change for them Benji's
The mula, the Fendis, I turn up for what?

[Verse 2: Logic]
Dressed up in that white linen
All black windows, I had to tint 'em
That work work, put 'em in the dirt
Let em' all lurk, know I had to get up with Durk
We never hurt, hurt know the deal
Tour sold out so you know it's real
From the Chi City to the fuckin' bank
Sinatra, money I've been Frank
Lemme get it I got it never feelin' divided homie on the real though
How you feel though, V's up, keep it trill though
Oh yeah, one time, oh yeah, one time
Bitch I been under pressure
Always giving it everything that I got
Never the lesser, turn on my compressor
It's right on the dresser
Been ruling the game and nobody could measure
I know it's...

[Bridge: Logic]
You and me, you and me
They don' give a damn who I am
Bitch I'm doing me (you and me)
I said it's you and me
I know who I am, don't give a damn
Bitch I'm doing me
