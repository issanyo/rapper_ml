[Hook: Zuse]
I just pour a four and pop me a zan
Pop a Perc and then throw me a band
All this money comin', all this money goin'
Flick of the wrist, I be switchin' my hand
Money comin' to me, nigga you rare
Steppin' on the work, you watch when I dance
Money over bitches, all about the riches
What you gon' do when you run out of cash?
Magic City, posted up with my crew
Pocket rocket fittin' all in my shoe
Run up on me and you know they all blue
Ferragamo on me and Jimmy Choo
VVS, you niggas ain't got a clue
Muddy water got a nigga on glue
You already know what I came to do
Throwin' on these bitches like whew

[Verse 1: Lil Durk]
I just want the money, fuck fame (?)
I just want the lean, pop a zan bag
I'ma make a movie, I ain't playin' bae
I don't need everything but a red bag
And bitch I'm Durk and I'm fuckin' up my main bae
I hit the hood in a two seater
But the city ride with the gang bangers and you know they ridin' with her
I did the (?), I did the set
I grip it designer so somebody help
I ride with my niggas through good and whatever
In the club with the hammer
Life is a gamble so test, test
Hit those gymnastics, get stretched
These bitches'll go if you let 'em
These bitches don't sweat 'em
I'm ridin' with gang

[Verse 2: 5Mics]
Mommy was a bad girl, skin tone mocha
I pull up in Rari, she pull off in the Rover
Talk for a minute, mix the Henny with the soda
Hit it in the back seat, all up in that chocha
G's in the purse, she be poppin' all the percs
Send her out of town she be movin' all the work
If a nigga violate her, I'ma put him in the dirt
Shorty got a body, you the baddest on earth
Mommy is a diva, dope rock sneakers
And we on the loud, smokin' like Khalifa
Sippin' on the lean, cream soda by the liter
Hundred karat diamonds and my chain got a freezer
You askin' bout me they gon' say I'm the man
Came to your city, your girl was a fan
Summer Miami, we fucked on the sand
Hit king of diamond I'm throwin' those bands
