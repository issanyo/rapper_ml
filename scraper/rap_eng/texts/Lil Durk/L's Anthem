[Verse 1]
You don't fuck with me, then fuck 'em
My own niggas, Ion't trust 'em
Bricksquad, I say fuck 'em
Wuga World wit' 'em so fuck 'em
I'm in these streets, no duckin'
This foreign mac, it's Russian
Kay Kay and Tee Tee, them hoes know they bussin'
I did a lot to these niggas, they mad we fuck they bitches
Fucked a couple them Barbies, now I need a pretty Mrs
OTF 300, the city ridin' with us
Too many say they drillin', throw the L's up for them hittaz

I don't know what got into me
I'm jammin' like I'm with MTV
Niggas know that we rich forever, like we fuckin' with MMG
Robbin', clearin' up niggas throat, .40 got a lemon squeeze
Coolin' on that mac too, hot shit for a winter breeze
Duckin' low from all the ops, blastin' at yo enemies
Yo' bitch know she doin' dick, we call that ho double D
We call that ho double D
Ain't nobody hot as me, L's

[Chorus]
L's up for them hittaz
Throw the L's up for them hittaz

[Verse 3]
I'm higher than an astronaut
I'm off the shit, I'm passin' out
I don't know what they tellin' 'bout, wearing wires a get 'em got
Where I'm from my niggas win
Couple niggas that gone for ten
Couple guys that's R.I.P, niggas know that we get it in
Life ain't no joke, nigga, L's up for Lil Mo, nigga
Life ain't no joke, nigga, L's up for lil Mo, nigga

[Chorus]
