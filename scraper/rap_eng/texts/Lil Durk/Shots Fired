It been a lot of sneak dissing going on
Niggas hating, bitches hating, cause we going strong
Niggas, bitches, bet that price I got to get em gone
On the internet beefing, we can get it on
Shots fired [x4]
It been a lot of sneak dissing going on
Niggas hating, bitches hating, cause we going strong

[Verse 1]
What you mean I’m cool? I’m hot
I’m on my block, I tote my Glocks
I’m on your ass, your ass is dumb
You think I’m not, your ass a fraud
Think it’s war, then fire some shots
All your squad can’t count no knots
You superman, you saving thots
I’m the shit,  bitch I’m a boss
Get knocked off, I get em off
Designer shit, bitch fuck the cost
300 with me, hit em hard
Play with me, you get em chopped
Twitter beef will get em killed
Instagram comments get em killed
If you 'bout a beef for real
I had this name before I had this deal
Screaming names will get you murked
Put on a shirt, I put in work
OTF, my niggas worse
We stay strapped, seatbelts and purse
The tommy I got, got a job, shoot at ops, my tommy work
Fuck your squad, my squad we hot
If it’s beef, we send shots first

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
All these rappers in Chicago
All these rappers, they the same thing
We took off and now they mad, but who is 300 to blame
Call [?], bring that thang, I called up bro, he bring that chain
All this shit up out that [?]
All these bitches want that fame
Treat my guys, I send em bread
I do me, bitch I’m the shit
How you get robbed and you ahead
You ain’t out here, bitch you scared
I lost [?] and I lost [?]
I lost family, I lost cake
All these niggas turned to snakes
Free Buchanan, I can’t wait
He get out, they change their face
I call a bust, ain’t talking pace
I smoke loud blunts to the face
I fuck forty, give her face
17, I caught my case
So don’t be victim till my case
Cokeboy, I’m a cokeboy
I got dope boy, just stay in your lane
