[Intro]
Let's get it
[Hook]
Did drills on that corner, shed blood for that block
Did bid for informants, I'll kill for that block
Out late selling cocoa, had the guns in the spot
Old heads with that old bread will never get a new slot
Believe it or not (believe it or not)
Believe it or not nigga yeah 4x

[Verse 1]
Got the spot booming yeah, shopping like it Bloomingdale
Try to hit us with a real nah
Think its Christmas how we moving bells
Take a L that's a mission fail
Pussy nigga don't try again
Cali trips send it through the mail
Hoping UPS not the feds
Me and my thinking is too legit
Took little Charles on stupid shit
Hoping you don't eat no pork my nigga
Fuck around and get your kufi hit
Glock drawn for a mickey mouse
Fuck around and get a goofy hit
Put 200 hundred on the dash nigga
Now I'm going on some movie shit
All the hitter shit started that
15 hundred how you ball with that
Jail call ain't no calling back
Snake me once and I'm falling back
Drop a 8 with a percocet
On the block went to war for that
OTF go to war for that
OTF I go to war for them

[Hook]
Did drills on that corner, shed blood for that block
Did big for informants, I'll kill for that block
Out late selling coka, had the guns in the spot
Old heads with that old bread will never get a new slot
Believe it or not (believe it or not)
Believe it or not nigga yeah 4x
