[Intro: Rich The Kid & Lil Durk]
Trap
You know what I need
You know Rich had to get 2X on this muthafucka
Racks!
Cash
Gang!
Woo

[Verse 1: Rich The Kid]
I might pop a perc and just go crazy
Fucking on your bitch like I want babies
Diamonds hit like Rocky bitch I'm famous
Walking with a hundred bitch I made it
Leaning and tripping on two pills
Sippin' on pints of the double seal
They told me to stop but I'm sippin' still
Yo hoe putting up but she know the drill
Momma' said be patient
I had no Mercedes
I was on the block I trapped that rock, like back in the 80s
Just know that I pour up a whole pint
Like fuck it I'm back on the dirty Sprite
I'm catching the plays like Jerry Rice
My young niggas killing might take your life
My teachers said I couldn't do right
Pull up in Porsche and it's all white
I'm all in her head like fucking lice
Play with the money you pay the price

[Hook: Rich The Kid]
What you need? I just want a bag with the cash in it
In the kitchen with no dishes but some bad bitches
I just want a bag with the cash in it
How we living, go and get it adding up them digits
I just want a bag with the cash in it
I need my money on time, each and every dime
I just want a bag with the cash in it
Just need a bitch that can dab with me

[Verse 2: Lil Durk]
That's a draco nigga
Full of them peso niggas, I pop out the cut like Fredo nigga
And these police niggas, better watch 'fore a nigga put a case on niggas (Let's get it!)
And these feds on me, feds on me, talk on a payphone nigga
And I fucked off of Adderall, IG hoes, I done fucked them all
Last plug ain't fuckin' wit me, 50 pounds I done tore them off
Chiraq is a mad city, no act, gotta keep red wit me
New car, do the dash silly
Quavo, do the dab with me
Go Hard, Chanel or Goyard
Free 9, bring him home with no charge
Fake frames, take those off
Designer, designer, designer shit
Chiraq and Atlanta shit
Robbed his ass while you panicking
Fresher than a fuckin' mannequin
I blew him back on that fast shit

[Hook: Rich The Kid]
What you need? I just want a bag with the cash in it
In the kitchen with no dishes but some bad bitches
I just want a bag with the cash in it
How we living, go and get it adding up them digits
I just want a bag with the cash in it
I need my money on time, each and every dime
I just want a bag with the cash in it
Just need a bitch that can dab with me

[Verse 3: Rich The Kid]
I might pop a xan and just go lazy
But I got them workers so they pay me
I got all these bitches like I'm pimpin'
And your baby momma' now she drippin'
Walking around with a lot of cash
Rari' I ride with a paper tag
Momma' she said that I'm living fast
I need to slow down but I do the dash
Put my wrist in it when I'm whippin' up
I got your bitch she gon' cook it up
Fuckin her all on the furniture
She don't speak no English a foreigner
Bitch quit playing I'm dangerous
I got the molly and Katie
I'm fuckin her she call me baby
Ain't go for it, you better pay me
Dressed in Givenchy I'm dabbing
Bricks disappearing no magic
You talking my money it's savage
A whole lotta' racks cause I gotta have it

[Hook: Rich The Kid]
What you need? I just want a bag with the cash in it
In the kitchen with no dishes but some bad bitches
I just want a bag with the cash in it
How we living, go and get it adding up them digits
I just want a bag with the cash in it
I need my money on time, each and every dime
I just want a bag with the cash in it
Just need a bitch that can dab with me
