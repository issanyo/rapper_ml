[Hook: Lil Durk]
Drugs got parts, my niggas got parts, life behind bars
Introduce me to the streets
Money got parts, in the kitchen cook it hard, and I'm riding in foreign cars
Introduce me to the streets
Introduce me to the streets (to the streets, to the streets)
Introduce me to the streets
Introduce me to the streets (to the streets, to the streets)
Introduce me to the streets
Introduce me to the streets (to the streets, to the streets)
Introduce me to the streets
Introduce me to the streets (to the streets, to the streets)

[Verse 1: Lil Durk]
Let's get it!
I first caught my case when I was 17
Free Rio, they trying to give him 17
Money, drugs got me introduced to everything
Got me signed to the streets with no wedding ring
Just cocaina, get wet up, Aquafina
Auto-tune, I'm a singer, I'm in that jam no singer
They see we got a leader
These niggas trying to linger
I caught a case and beat it, Ike and Tina
Never thought I'd make it out the 'hood
.40 .40 on my waist deep, no Meagan Good
What I explain ain't got to be understood
Money and my squad got me out the 'hood

[Hook: Lil Durk]
Drugs got parts, my niggas got parts, life behind bars
Introduce me to the streets
Money got parts, in the kitchen cook it hard, and I'm riding in foreign cars
Introduce me to the streets
Introduce me to the streets (to the streets, to the streets)
Introduce me to the streets
Introduce me to the streets (to the streets, to the streets)
Introduce me to the streets
Introduce me to the streets (to the streets, to the streets)
Introduce me to the streets
Introduce me to the streets (to the streets, to the streets)

[Verse 2: Lil Durk]
Grew up off Link and low-income
Savage in the streets, ain't no 'ho in them
I be sipping lean until my face is numb
I'm thumbing through a check until my fingers numb
Streets a motherfucker, can't trust a motherfucker
Niggas be super-bitches, can't spare a crumb for you
Why keep that drug money?
Why keep that plug, homie?
I'm going broke, just pull that plug on me
Life behind bars ain't the same no more
Niggas ain't your niggas, ain't the same no more
Change for $100 ain't no money no more
Niggas ain't starving, they ain't hungry no more
