[Verse]

In the hood, going hard
Niggas know I’m bout that action
Got that 30 ride that will whoop
So you pussies stop that acting
Adrianas 30 deep, I get paid it’s all my actions
I made L's, in Chicago, got the city go bananas
Got 300 on my neck, so you know I’m with the shit
On parole, drop the opps, OTF we taking risks
Niggas say they ran me off
You know I can’t run for shit
Even though they hate me first
I can’t let them hate for shit
Got a chance, 2012, nigga I can’t change for shit
Fucking hoes, running hoes, and we’re acting like the shit
Claim 300, got a deal, now they begging for the dick
She was on a nigga …you should have seen this bitch
Went to jail, cut the dreads, but I’m still a fucking hitta
She mistake me with a nigga, but he still my fucking nigga
And I’ve lost too many guys, hold a grudge for my nigga
Hold a grudge for my niggas
Man I love my niggas

Cop the range, all black, ain’t gotta stunt cause I got it
Watching me, be safe, best believe my niggas got it
Run up on me, try to rob me, you gonn make me catch a case
Niggas talking all that shit, you gonn make me catch his face
Let’s get it!

L's
Aye last of a dying breed coming soon
Just a little sneak peak
Just some Sorry For The Wait shit
Aye free the guys
OTF man
GBE we see y'all god
