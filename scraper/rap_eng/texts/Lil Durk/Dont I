[Verse 1: Lil Durk]
I Remember that summer
Me and J Munna had no money
Only thing that we had
Was a dollar and a dream
Some lean and that burner
Take a nigga down
For that 1400
Spend it on guns
For all the opp niggas
And i miss all of my niggas
Spending nigga shit
Tweak with my niggas
(Wait) I remember Chino
Told me they exposed you
If you know me
Can't a nigga hold you
I'ma Shed love
Like im supposed to
These niggas dont owe you
And i dont owe a nigga shit
Ima let a nigga know how i roll
300,OTF is who im rolling with
Pop out the cut
We fucking shit up
We do what i do
Catch a opp nigga
Now the block is named after you
We dont lie on these tracks
I'ma get money
You fucking with me
I'ma put that on jmunna nigga (Bow)
