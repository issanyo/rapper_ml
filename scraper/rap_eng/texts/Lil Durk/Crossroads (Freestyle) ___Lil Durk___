(Intro)
& I lost my brothers at the crossroad
Don’t wanna be lonely
Crossroad

(Hook)
Meet me at the crossroad, never be lonely, meet me at the crossroad
Meet me at the crossroad, never be lonely, meet me at the crossroad
And I'm gonna miss everybody
And I'm gonna miss everybody love
And I'm gonna miss everybody
And I'm gonna miss everybody
And I'm gonna miss everybody love
Don't want to be lonely (meet me at the crossroad)
Don't want to be lonely (meet me at the crossroad)
Don't want to be lonely (meet me at the crossroad)
Don't want to be lonely (meet me at the crossroad)
(Woe)

(Verse)
And I'm gonna miss everybody
Lil Quay Lil mont
Everybody
Lil red Lil rob
Everybody
I done seen
They dead body
& these niggas steadily
Plotting
Thinking we don’t hear about them
Time to put some fear
Inside em
Woee
LOR bitch we leading
Niggas know just how bleeding
Bit our style but they keep it
They just mad cause we ain’t even
Don’t switch sides the streets
Is speaking
Homicides turn beefing
Every move I know peeping
Don’t run up on us
Choppas squeezing
We can’t fall out
Bout no whores
Only real niggas on my side
Idk bout yours
Yeah
Gotta make a choice
If you ain’t
Near my position
Don’t care bout your voice
See niggas change
Had to make arrangements
If I was still hung them guys
I’d probably be brainless
Niggas change up
For that bread
That shit so shameless
They claim they want my head
They just ain’t aiming
4 nem keep it true
Ain’t nobody changed here
We been through this hail road
It’s still the same here
We lost the same people
We ain’t got the same tears
The devil better
Quit playing with me
I don’t think he can hear

(Outro)
Spread the love
“These niggas hate I’ll die bout it ”
Spread the love
“LOR the gang I’ll die bout them”
Spread the love
“For my bitch I swear I’ll shoot shots bout ha”
Speard the love
“Lost some niggas ain’t gone cry about it”
I’m so deep in this zone
I thought bout this popping this xan
My baby think ima leave her
I told her that ain’t the plan
So much shit we done been through
Done turned me to a new man
My love you for you so Genuine
I swear I can’t pretend
Woeee
