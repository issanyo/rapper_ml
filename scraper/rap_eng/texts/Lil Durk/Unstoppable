[Hook: Lil Durk]
I had to get out and hustle, had to get out the jungle
Put them drugs in my system, it's crazy, I used to trust you
You can't feel how I feel, I take them perkys and numb it
You can't live how I live, they be so mad cause I'm humble
Street nigga, unstoppable, my vultures unstoppable
Together unstoppable (We unstoppable)
You say you wanna try me then what's stoppin' you
You say you wanna try me then what's stoppin' you

[Verse 1: Lil Durk]
Off drugs all day, shootouts all night
Don't believe what you say, these niggas all hype
When I gave you my Glock, you ain't take care of the opps
Traffickin' all them drugs, couldn't make no stops had to watch for the cops
You don't know what I did, let's merc some blood while I put on my keys
Mac 11, 4-5 that's it, DOA when I went to shell
Theses niggas ain't stop when it's time to slide (no)
They pick up that gun when it's time to ride (oh)
Put them before my children, my momma say I'm trippin
I'm stuck inside the trenches, off the perkys I be trippin'
And these niggas had to get me a shot of a nigga dissin'
Ridin my pipe and I know it's risky, can't be broke I gotta get it

[Hook: Lil Durk]
I had to get out and hustle, had to get out the jungle
Put them drugs in my system, it's crazy, I used to trust you
You can't feel how I feel, I take them perkys and numb it
You can't live how I live, they be so mad cause I'm humble
Street nigga, unstoppable, my vultures unstoppable
Together unstoppable (We unstoppable)
You say you wanna try me then what's stoppin' you
You say you wanna try me then what's stoppin' you

[Verse 2: Lil Reese]
3hunnit, fuck nigga say he going try us then what's stopping you
Shame nigga, yeah they don't point, yeah they be whatchin' too
All this money I got on me, lemme show you what the guapo do
Stear right around wit the killas, I guess I'm ridin' too
Too high off the percs and the lean but the young nigga still got the tools
I got my brothers wit me, yeah, they all wit me, yeah, they all gon' shoot
Yeah, I ball, no hoop, this a 23 not a 22
In the jungle wit a 2, so we all gon' shoot
So they all wit you, but I can't trust you
I put drugs in my system for the niggas that I lost
I took a loss (I took a loss), that's what it cost (that's what it cost)
That shit that made a young nigga a boss

[Hook: Lil Durk]
I had to get out and hustle, had to get out the jungle
Put them drugs in my system, it's crazy, I used to trust you
You can't feel how I feel, I take them perkys and numb it
You can't live how I live, they be so mad cause I'm humble
Street nigga, unstoppable, my vultures unstoppable
Together unstoppable (We unstoppable)
You say you wanna try me then what's stoppin' you
You say you wanna try me then what's stoppin' you
