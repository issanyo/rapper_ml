[Intro: YFN Lucci]
Why they turn they back on me?
Ayy, tell me why them niggas
Yeah, yeah, yeah, uh-huh, ayy

[Chorus: YFN Lucci]
Let me know if you feel my pain, yeah
To the niggas who turned they back on me, yeah
Hey, tell me why them niggas changed, yeah
And you know got a crawl a little
You can ball a little but maintain
Oh them niggas turned they back on me
Yeah, I guess that's in the game, yeah

[Verse 1: YFN Lucci]
Uh, I was gettin' it slower, yeah
I was playin' with fishes, I get in that bowl, yeah
You swim with the fishes, go and gettin' it cold
And I can tell some shit but I ain't never told, yeah
Ayy, look I can sell you some shit but you ain't never sold shit
And I can tell by your wrist that you still on that old shit
I might go grab a Givenchy and Louis, my whole fit
Ayy and my pocket got a whole .30
And the clip so long, hold the whole .30
Take a trip, do a show, that's a whole 30
I've been down so long, feel like I deserve it
If anythin' you can bet, I'm workin', yeah, yeah

[Chorus: YFN Lucci & Lil Durk]
Let me know if you feel my pain, yeah
To the niggas who turned they back on me, yeah
Hey, tell me why them niggas changed, yeah
And you know got a crawl a little
You can ball a little but maintain
Oh them niggas turned they back on me
Yeah, I guess that's in the game, yeah
YFN Lucci
New Year
Turn up, turn up, turn up
Let's get it

[Verse 2: Lil Durk]
I'm in somethin', came from nothin', man, I grew up impossible
Name a ring, rap and sing, king, Demarcus Cousins
Niggas traded on me deeply, niggas fake for nothin'
Bro and them legal doin' truckin', they ain't start for nothin'
Strapped like Uzi Vert, put you on a shirt
Niggas say they love you hard but be the one to hurt you first
Put some niggas in the dirt, I've been real since birth
And we ain't known to bust back, pussy nigga, we shoot first
Gucci jacket, damn near 5 stacks, I was trappin' 5 packs
Thought it was McDonalds' with these 5 MACs
If you shoot, we blast back, I was taught to blast back
Bitches had me side tracked, they know we can't have that

[Chorus: YFN Lucci]
Let me know if you feel my pain, yeah
To the niggas who turned they back on me, yeah
Hey, tell me why them niggas changed, yeah
And you know got a crawl a little
You can ball a little but maintain
Oh them niggas turned they back on me
Yeah, I guess that's in the game, yeah
