Five mo', five in a row

On my nose a bandanna ('danna), in my neck is a Phantom (Phantom)
All my hoes from Atlanta ('lanta), all my dogs in the slammer (slammer)
Talk to Death Row (woah), talk to Tony Montana (oh, yeah)

Throwing up in the Audi after fistin' and menage

[Verse 2: Lil Durk]
Straight up, in that jeep, I can't wait up
He ain't say who he say he is, he an actor, he play tough
I just copped me a Rollie, okay, I lied, 'cause I took it
Do a show in a valley, I tell 'em boys to go book
Fresh out my city, I'm shootin', land in my city, I'm coolin'
Bunch of niggas smokin' Tooka, ride with guns in a Uber
I get caught, I can't go, my lawyer fresh from Jerusalem
Audi R8 logo look like 4 kids hoola hoopin', woah

[Chorus: Travis Scott]
Five mo', five in a row
They at ya door from Lamron down to the mo'
Can't get out of my head, can't keep takin' these meds
Five in a row (yup), I want some mo' (yup)
Five mo' (straight up), five in a row (yup)
They at ya door from Lamron down-down to the mo'
Can't get out of my head (yup), can't keep takin' these meds (straight up)
Like five mo' (yup), five in a row, yeah
