[Verse 1: Lil Durk]
Times ain't eat right
Call my nigga I keep pipe, street life
Gotta tote that .30 of that street life
3 Mice they ain’t Blind I know them niggas see right
All the rats, sign the papers gave my daddy 10 lifes
Niggas say I switched up shit
Only thing i switched up was me chasin' a bitch
Or me chansin' the M's
Millions of murders
Where I'm from is millions of murders
He a snitch he ain't straight, he ain't cursive
I put my city on, niggas hate, that I put my city on
I'm a baws i dont give a fuck i got my diddy on
I'm be he's weight till a pussy nigga send me home
I keep that fifth (5th), like an Alcoholic
I Can’t Sit (Why ?) this Money Calling
I need jewel, drugs, cars and a crib wit parking
I see a opp with sparkin'
And they know that they Dead Meat
We a family not a gang, and we out here play for keeps
Baby momma trippin' thinking she gonna get fed for free
Better start working bitch, Lil Durk ain't no deadbeat, but i keep that red beam!
Jojo talking, wilding out
Where he at, take him out
So many bricks in the trap, we can make a house
Money is go off in, you go off in cloud
Brono lost that crowd for ten, he dont know when he's comin out
Durk album sittin' at the label when he coming out
Name popping got my shit popping I ain't droppin' out
Call Kanye West he ain't the only nigga dropping out
400K first day, yeah they Jockin' now

[Verse 2: Durk]
I just bought more choppas dont get extra wet
OTF, Nuski gang bitch am reppin' that
Its a murder scene while im stabbin' that
Shoot out from far back, bitch you catchin dat
Yeh that bitch go Boom, Boom, Boom, Boomm!
Car go Zoom, Zoom, Zoom, Zoomm!
No new niggas, ain't no room
Bitch i am a goon
(Let's get it)

[Outro]
Remember my name
Remember my name
Remember my name
One thing i can't change
Remember my name
Remember my name
Remember my name
One thing i can't change
Let's get it!
