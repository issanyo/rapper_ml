(Intro)
Gang shit AMR nigga money team gang shit nigga
Free all the guys nigga free my niggas nigga free them out them slums

(Hook)
I'm still sending niggas money orders
Bad thots still in the field for em'
My niggas calling still paying for these lawyers
The plugged jammed still do this shit for em'
I'm still sending niggas money orders
Bad thots still in the field for em'
My niggas calling still paying for these lawyers

[Verse] (AMR Freak)
Round table all hittas breaking down these brickas
Half brickas, whole brickas, fucking up the mixture
SRTs, 20 bucks, that's a quarter bricka
Bill 80 on the dash ain't no running nigga
3 bucks to see money that's a pot of killas
Making 20 once a week getting off these zippas
Feds lurking man I bet they got 100 pictures
Late night in them cuts we whacked a couple niggas

(Hook)

[Verse] (Lil Durk)
I done told all of my niggas they riders
OTF niggas can't divide us
We is a family you don't know how
Half us get money, half us savage
Half of us dead, half of us alive
Add it all up, ain't talking miles
And I'm half turned into a ho, that's the life of a savage
Money order. Greendot
Feed the kids shed tears
Plenty block headshots
Get caught doing plenty years
Free Zoo and free Law
To this day they getting it in
These niggas they lose lose where I'm from we win win win

(Hook)
