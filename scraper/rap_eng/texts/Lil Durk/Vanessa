[Verse 1: King Louie]
Bands on bands, bitches on bitches
Bitches and money, iPhone 6 kissin' on pictures
Bitches ain't shit, we share bitches
Vanessa sucked on my dick but that's yo bitch
Folks don't care, broke shit rare
Since we in the cars she suck did there
Came all in her face, her clothes, and hair
Hit the club with bankrolls to throw in the air
Take off her top like the roof of my car
When that money show off I bet yo bitch go far
Bizzy and Grant tryna sing to a slut
Biggest one turn your dog to a mutt
Know I'm ballin' cause its all in my gut
[?] I might buy her a butt
I be smiling so much cause my [?] should rock the bus
If you ain't bout makin' no money get the fuck away from mine
Masterpiece, bout it bout it
Yo bitch, hit everybody, everybody, everybody

[Hook: Lil Durk]
I can't wife these hoes, got bands in my jeans
Mitch be like miss shit, I put his hand in the lean
Crisp Louis Vuitton, red bottom got blood on the scene
Don't cuff her, just fuck her, she gon' do the whole damn team
I'm talkin' lil' freaky lil' nasty bitch, these hoes ain't shit
Freaky lil' nasty bitch, I can't wife these bitches
Freaky lil' nasty bitch, you're a nothing ass bitch
Freaky lil' nasty bitch, I can't wife these bitches

[Verse 3: Lil Mouse]
Bands on bands, I keep bands on me
Don't bring your girl 'round me, cause I'm a dog homie
She won't leave me alone, she think she gon' get in my pockets
And if you lookin' wrong bro gon' give you six out that rocket
They know I started from the bottom, now I'm posted at the top
Balmain zipper on my pants, you won't catch me in no Rocks
If you owe me money you got 24 hours to get my guap
Spent bout 50 on my watch, look like full my diamond watch
Fuckin' everybody's bitch, man I know she gon' let me hit
I heard she just sucked four dicks, so you better not kiss that bitch
You could come and get the bitch, cause the squad already hit
Better not wife her, she do dicks, me and Pookie ran that bitch
