[Intro]
JD on the track
It's a Leekeleek banga

[Chorus: Lil Durk]
My young niggas go 7:30, these fuck niggas they tryna hurt me
This street shit we ain't worried, like shout out my brother Birdie
When you can't call him bro, can we count up to our money, uh, uh
My niggas ain't bout that ra ra, they gon' do what they say they is
Opps be all on my top, that .45, that's a lemon squeeze
See my brother tried to beast, they chapter threes
I keep that FN on me, 'cause they want me

[Verse 1: Lil Durk]
They say they catch me they gon' do me dirty
Two in my head like a Wall jersey
Slept in the trenches roaches crawled on me
Ain't like no pictures 'cause my wall's dirty
Had a baby by a bitch who with other turf
For Booka do double life for my brother worth
They wanna see me die, they see my mother hurt
We don't fall out for no niggas, I put my brother first
I'ma take these Percies 'til my stomach burst
I lost my cousin, made my stomach hurt
And with this fame I kill any nigga wanna see Verney hurt
Put my life on the line for niggas who don't put me first

[Chorus: Lil Durk]
My young niggas go 7:30, these fuck niggas they tryna hurt me
This street shit we ain't worried, like shout out my brother Birdie
When you can't call him bro, can we count up to our money, uh, uh
My niggas ain't bout that ra ra, they gon' do what they say they is
Opps be all on my top, that .45 that's a lemon squeeze
See my brother tried to beast, they chapter threes
I keep that FN on me, 'cause they want me

[Verse 2: Booka600]
In my brothers I believe 'em, until the end I guarantee, yeah
You got my loyalty indeed, and a couple Glocks if you need them
And we gon' stick to the procedure, you got my back and always even
We just some vultures they can't seize us, we go to war for Four Six, uh
Only fan, yeah that's my legion, from the nine you can catch this ether
Watch the bullets catch and watch their soul leave 'em
Ay boo, they called us creatures, bro they tweakin'
They play with me I leave 'em, got some feeders

[Chorus: Lil Durk]
My young niggas go 7:30, these fuck niggas they tryna hurt me
This street shit we ain't worried, like shout out my brother Birdie
When you can't call him bro, can we count up to our money, uh, uh
My niggas ain't bout that ra ra, they gon' do what they say they is
Opps be all on my top, that .45, that's a lemon squeeze
See my brother tried to beast, they chapter threes
I keep that FN on me, 'cause they want me
