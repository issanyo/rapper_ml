[Intro: Ty Dolla $ign]
Count up with a boss, I hope she's worth it, ooh yeah, ooh yeah
She just wanna count up with a boss

[Hook: Ty Dolla $ign]
She know where I'm from, she wanna rep it now
She just wanna count up with a boss
I hope she's worth it
I hope she's worth it, I hate wastin' time
This the truth, I ain't got time for lies, no, no, no, no
She just wanna, she just wanna love a thug
I can't love you, sorry, I'm in love with money
She just wanna, she just wanna love a thug
But I can't love you, baby, I'm in love with money

[Verse 1: Lil Durk]
I do not fuck with no basic hoes
Talk about bands, I play with those
I got 'em, I got 'em, I got 'em, I got 'em
Lil Durk is not chasin' hoes
Bougie bitches my favorite hoes
Louis up for my staple hoes
All dick for unable hoes
Sippin' lean with my maple hoes
Moncler for the winter
Balmain for the dinner
I need twelve how I spend it
Now you mad, Vic Mensa
Ain't nobody perfect
Bring her home to my mama now
Ain't nobody worth it
I am who they worship
You ain't better than my worst shit
What you tell them?
And I like the way she work it
What you tell them?
Way that she twerkin'
Lil mama, she good and she perfect
I gave you my number, so work it

[Hook: Ty Dolla $ign]
She know where I'm from, she wanna rep it now
She just wanna count up with a boss
I hope she's worth it
I hope she's worth it, I hate wastin' time
This the truth, I ain't got time for lies, no, no, no, no
She just wanna, she just wanna love a thug
I can't love you, sorry, I'm in love with money
She just wanna, she just wanna love a thug
But I can't love you, baby, I'm in love with money

[Verse 2: Lil Durk]
I love my money too much
These bitches be on me too much
Just copped me a foreign in two months
They know Durk doin' too much
Summer time, roof up
Head like a tutor
Off the molly, bood up
Real nigga, fool none
Basic is not an option
Even when I was not poppin'
Check the grammar, hot topic
You reside here, thottie
She real, she trill
She don't get down, how she live
She been through jail and all
And shawty did not tell
Ayy that's my baby, yeah she worth it
That's my baby, yeah she worth it

[Hook: Ty Dolla $ign]
She know where I'm from, she wanna rep it now
She just wanna count up with a boss
I hope she's worth it
I hope she's worth it, I hate wastin' time
This the truth, I ain't got time for lies, no, no, no, no
She just wanna, she just wanna love a thug
I can't love you, sorry, I'm in love with money
She just wanna, she just wanna love a thug
But I can't love you, baby, I'm in love with money
