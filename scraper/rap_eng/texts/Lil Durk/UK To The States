[Hook: Mad-Money]
UK to the States, niggas getting slapped
Get robbed for your chain, you won't get it back
UK to the States, niggas getting slapped
We don't play that shit, we don't play that
UK to the States, niggas getting slapped
Get robbed for your chain, you won't get it back
Remember back in the days, niggas getting stabbed
Nowadays, niggas spray, hit em with the MAC

[Verse 1: Mad-Money]
Same shit, another day, sitting in the trap
Just me and my mates listening to my track
Paranoid, I think the jakes listening on the tap
If it weren't for niggas snitching, prisons wouldn't be packed
Late night shit, rolling with the strap
Nigga [?] runs the ends, blow him off the map
Got my finger on the trigger and I'm on the dank
Kill a nigga, it's a thriller, this is not a prank

[Hook: Mad-Money]

[Verse 2: Lil Durk]
Rob em, bitch [?] momma two cases
I'm fighting drama but they don't want no drama, trauma
Slide in the Audi, foreign driver, police watching
Niggas sniffing, they be tricking for them commas
Do a hit, you should see that 223 doing tricks
I'm ahead about myself so ain't nobody here a trick
Can't trust a bitch, only fucking with my karate choppers
Breaking bricks, bag em down to make [?]
Got that bando going wala, [?] that pot that ta da
Put guns and drugs on blocka
Therefore these [?] blocka
From us we got our block hot
Trust why we doing commas
From us we got our block hot
That's why we doing commas, let's get it, squad

[Hook: Mad-Money]

[Verse 3: Gunna Dee]
Cat a stray, that's a stray coma
Think you've got heart? I'll turn you to a great donor
Gun smoking, call it luck homer
I'll leave you with a blue face, that's a Daytona
Niggas popping, them niggas dropping
I could take you out the picture, call it picture cropping
Stay on top of cake, let them see the topping
Cause these hating cops hate to see a nigga copping
[?] then I was back then I was back to being broke again
From my back, pushing packs of the coke again
My man load the guns, he just roll in with a load of men
Kick the doors off, fuck if it's opening

[Hook: Mad-Money]
