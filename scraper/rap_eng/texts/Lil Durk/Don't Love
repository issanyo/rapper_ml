[Chorus: Lil Durk]
VVS's dripping down my neck, I'ma drown ho
Smith and Wesson, thinking I'm a game, I'm like Rambo
Came a long way from the trenches and the bando
Now it's me and Booka, Ikey, Doodie in a Lambo
Switchin' lanes, switchin' lanes, can't switch up on my main gang
You will die in the trenches thinking shit a game
These streets don't love you, these niggas don't love you for real
These bitches don't love you, these bitches don't love you for real

[Verse 1: Lil Durk]
You can't run from your problems, nigga, you can't avoid it
They don't believe Rondo can get out, I got a lawyer
I'm from the dirt with my brothers like we came from soil
We too loyal to let this money change us, shit not royal
Get out these streets lil bro, this shit ain't for you
Just know that shit a lie when they say they love you
Gotta watch out for that knife when they come and hug you
'Cause it be the same niggas to come and slug you
I'm product of my environment
Bro a ex-killer, come out retirement
If he go down by himself for that case he'll tie you in
They gon' pull your strings like a violin
They gon' shoot your shit in traffic, no matter what car you in
Went to the streets and asked the dope boys is they hiring?
Gotta shoot something just to be with us, can't sign you in
If you over there and you don't 'pose to, you gon' die with them
Mama told me stay off these drugs, I need counseling
Tryna serve without paying, something gotta give
Always gotta chase a check, my son gotta live
How the fuck you want they custody, you ain't got a crib?
Got a crib, got a crib
Never serve a nigga where you gotta live
Secretive, secretive
Never tell a nigga where you live

[Chorus: Lil Durk]
VVS's dripping down my neck, I'ma drown ho
Smith and Wesson, thinking I'm a game, I'm like Rambo
Came a long way from the trenches and the bando
Now it's me and Booka, Ikey, Doodie in a Lambo
Switchin' lanes, switchin' lanes, can't switch up on my main gang
You will die in the trenches thinking shit a game
These streets don't love you, these niggas don't love you for real
These bitches don't love you, these bitches don't love you for real

[Verse 2: Derez De'Shon]
These bitches don't love you for real
These niggas don't love you for real
See love get you killed
I swear love gon' get me killed
Been through so much pain, I'm poppin' drugs with the pills
Yeah, I came from nothin' and I made it, niggas hate me
Bitches tryna have my baby, I even don't understand it
I keep get into it with my family, they keep askin' me for paper when they hear me on the radio station
All I wanted was the money, never wanted fame
Niggas actin' like they know me, they don't even know my pain
Bitch actin' like she know me, she don't even know my name
I'm a son of a king but ain't no crown when we talk reign
I got hoels in my umbrella
If I would've known, I probably would have done better
Put my trust in niggas when I should have known better
Bustin' my pistol, when it's empty, nigga gon' tell it
I'm jealous 'cause these niggas fake but they get respect
They lyin' in they rhymes, I tell the truth and I get neglect
Really sold nicks and dimes, tryna get a check in
Before dinner time, if not dinner, at least breakfast

[Chorus: Lil Durk]
VVS's dripping down my neck, I'ma drown ho
Smith and Wesson, thinking I'm a game, I'm like Rambo
Came a long way from the trenches and the bando
Now it's me and Booka, Ikey, Doodie in a Lambo
Switchin' lanes, switchin' lanes, can't switch up on my main gang
You will die in the trenches thinking shit a game
These streets don't love you, these niggas don't love you for real
These bitches don't love you, these bitches don't love you for real
