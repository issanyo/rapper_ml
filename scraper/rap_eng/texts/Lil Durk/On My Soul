[Intro:]
Who is durk to you?
Durk that's blood cousin his momma my auntie
My momma his auntie blood
Real shit man
So when you all say blood you all mean blood?
OTF this is family nigga
This shit ain’t war it’s blood

[Hook:]
Go through so much, nobody know
Hand on my pipe can't trust a soul
Times ain't the same we getting old
These niggas fu they get exposed
That's on my soul, my soul, my soul, my soul
Devil want my soul, my soul, my soul
Who said I sold my soul for gold and clothes and hoes
No, no, no, no, no, no

[Verse 1:]
Feel my pain, how you feel my shoes, can't feel my name
Once I hit the top I ain't gone change that's on my soul
Once you know about waking up in the middle of the snow
Seeing the news watching people dead that you know
I lost niggas but family different
My niggas family so tell me what's different
I came in late selling packs, momma tripping
I'm feeding family so tell me who get it
I ain't go to school I was on that block
I needed education, I forgot
You could forgive but never forget
Whatever I'm with my niggas they with

[Hook:]
Go through so much, nobody know
Hand on my pipe can't trust a soul
Times ain't the same we getting old
These niggas fu they get exposed
That's on my soul, my soul, my soul, my soul
Devil want my soul, my soul, my soul
Who said I sold my soul for gold and clothes and hoes
No, no, no, no, no, no

[Verse 2:]
I know the consequences of my actions
Knew I'll be rich when I start rapping
When shit was real, when niggas lacking
Just made our city murder capital
I said fuck school I was always absent
Niggas need oscars, they always acting
Niggas is bitches they always reacting
I tell a nigga he get clapped like magic
Me and my niggas we been through so much
For that band my niggas get you touched
Break your legs that ain't enough
And this my city ain't letting up
That's on my soul

[Hook:]
Go through so much, nobody know
Hand on my pipe can't trust a soul
Times ain't the same we getting old
These niggas fu they get exposed
That's on my soul, my soul, my soul, my soul
Devil want my soul, my soul, my soul
Who said I sold my soul fuck gold and clothes and hoes
No, no, no, no, no, no
