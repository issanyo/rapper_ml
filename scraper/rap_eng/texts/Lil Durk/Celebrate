[Hook: Mali Mercury]
We got models plus bottles
Eating steak with the lobster
Did the Louis and some Prada
Living rich is the motto
Got some shooters out Chicago
That’ll kill you for a dollar
Got them bobbers that’ll swallow
I can’t see you, I need goggles
Let’s celebrate, let’s celebrate
Let’s celebrate, celebrate
Let’s celebrate, celebrate
Celebrate, let’s celebrate
Let’s celebrate, celebrate
Celebrate, let’s celebrate
Let’s celebrate, celebrate
Yeah yeah yeah, let’s celebrate

[Verse 1: Swipey]
Let’s celebrate, let’s celebrate
They wanna hate, then let ‘em hate
We gon’ go up like an elevate
We gon’ pull up, hop out of that Escalade
This shit that I smoke make you levitate
I walk in, swipe your bitch, I won’t hesitate
Like a fat bitch I want hella cake
I cut my grass, I seen hella snakes
Getting money, let me demonstrate
Steak and shrimp all on my dinner plate
Boy your price is too high, let’s negotiate
Boy your pockets like Gucci, they losing weight
We going up, escalate
I’m blowing up, hand grenade
I pour a six in my lemonade
My bitch a queen bee, lemonade
Plus my name buzzing like beehive
The lean slow me up like a rewind
Bad bitch cooking dope in her knee highs
We done came a long way from rocking Levi’s
He say he been getting money, he lyin'
All these pussy niggas cats, felines
Yeah they call me Dirty Ass, not the behind
Think his bitch bad, wait until you see mine

[Verse 2: Lil Durk]
Let’s celebrate, let’s celebrate
Money coming so I elevate
I get to the money like andale
The condom busts if you hella late
Niggas is bitches, they hella fake
Just copped the Rollie, look at the Wraith
She give me head and I meditate
Two hundred thou’, I seen better days
Now I’m the shit and they check for me
Don’t call my phone, ain’t got checks for me
Nothing ain't free what they expect from me
Look at my diamonds caressing me
I’m high right now and I’m fly right now, off a pint right now
My bitch bi right now, these police ass niggas top flight right now
Gang gang gang gang
