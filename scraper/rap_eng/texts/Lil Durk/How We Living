[Intro]
[?] on the beat

[Verse 1: OTF Ikey]
Livin' like a star, carry guns to flip a pie
I done doped up every bar (dope),  I done sold up every scar (eskitit)
Know this pole is never far (nah-uh), I'm smokin' OG out this jar (OG)
I'm like LeBron just watch me ball (ball), I'm gettin' money fuck 'em all (fuck 'em)
And help gun that nigga down, its OTF we run the town
And don't you run your fuckin' mouth, next load is twenty thousand
These niggas hoes I know it now (yea), and my cup done slowed me down (slowed down)
Diamonds real, they drippin' on me, yeah your shit is watered down (watered down)
Shawty put the pussy on me (let's get it), after that, move around (bitch)
Bitches in their feelin', capture that, Instagram
Chasin' out these mils, hit that trap, flip again (flip, flip)
It's a crazy feelin' ridin' in the minivan (skrt skrt)

[Chorus: OTF Ikey & Lil Durk]
Why you actin' different, different
Went and got you trippin', trippin'
We ain't have no pot to piss in
Look at how we livin' (listen)
4 in the mornin', on missions
Now somebody's missin'
But nobody listen (you ain't listen)
Look how we livin'
Why you actin' different, different
Went and got you trippin', trippin'
We ain't have no pot to piss in
Look at how we livin'
4 in the mornin', on missions
Now somebody's missin'
But nobody listen
Shoot up out the door
Look how we livin'

[Verse 2: Lil Durk]
Durk he a vulture (vulture)
Free all my shorties, they didn't wanna listen (gang)
I had to get up and I go and get it (gang)
Shorty shootin' like he on the '6ers (blam)
I love my brothers 'cause them niggas different (gang)
I seen't the papers and I heard you snitchin' (yeah)
Put him on the [?] level [?]
Down to ride with my niggas, gotta ride around tinted (oh)
And I'm loyal to my niggas, I would die if I didn't
Don't come to my funeral
[?] go smoke out the bowl, police won't leave us alone
Niggas be beggin' for shows, niggas be askin' for loans
I'm gone (skirt), yeah, turn up
Chopper make a fuck nigga see through (let's get it)
Smokin' on cookie, got a sweet tooth (gas)
I don't fuck with him 'cause he a fool (yeah, yeah)
Nigga said I told on his people (people)
Popped me a flat, I reboot (chk-chk, grrat)
If I miss I re-shoot (skrt)

[Chorus: OTF Ikey]
Why you actin' different, different (yeah, yeah)
Went and got you trippin', trippin' (yeah, yeah)
We ain't have no pot to piss in (yeah, yeah)

Why you actin' different, different (yeah, yeah)
Went and got you trippin', trippin' (yeah, yeah)
