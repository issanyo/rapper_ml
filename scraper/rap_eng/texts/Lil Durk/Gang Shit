Out west shit nigga
You know how we rocking nigga
Get yo guns up, Get yo funds up
You on that opp shit, Get mop-sticked

[Chorus: Lud Foe]
I'm a young dope selling with a felon
Riding round with Mac 11's
I ain't no a job so I robbed and sell dope
Her boyfriend mad I get guap and he broke
Sawed off shotty right up under my peacoat
I'm a young dope selling with a felon
Riding round with Mac 11's
I ain't no a job so I robbed and sell dope
Her boyfriend mad I get guap and he broke
Sawed off shotty right up under my peacoat

[Verse 1: Lud Foe]
Slipped my Glock in the club, I'm an asshole
Put the one-thousand-dollar shoes, In yo asshole
I'm colorblind but still see the money, If I was blind folded
You wanna go to war, Better be careful bout what you ask for
We do drive-by's, doing high speeds in a Lambo
I got mob ties, you know its shooters in Chicago
I been getting money fucking theses bitches, That just the motto
Dread-heads come full of guns, Wherever I go
(Gang)
I'm selling dope, I gotta get my bread right
We catch a opp, Leave his ass dead at the red light
Red bone and she super thick, And her head right
Fucked her twice but I kicked her out, She can't spend the night
(Gang)

[Chorus: Lud Foe]
I'm a young dope selling with a felon
Riding round with Mac 11's
I ain't no a job so I robbed and sell dope
Her boyfriend mad I get guap and he broke
Sawed off shotty right up under my peacoat
I'm a young dope selling with a felon
Riding round with Mac 11's
I ain't no a job so I robbed and sell dope
Her boyfriend mad I get guap and he broke
Sawed off shotty right up under my peacoat

[Verse 2: Lil Durk]
20-12 I got signed, Bought some tommy guns
Imma take him out his shoes, Thats what robbers done
Last nigga snatched my chain, Bro nem chopped him up
You could never DJ Nate me, Boy we sparking something
We gon park where they spin the block, And meet me back
I lost Nuski caught his opps, I needed that
I sold dope, sold coke, Never sold guns
And I'm only throwing hundreds, I don't need ones
Call Seven he fron 600, Thats spartan 2 times
Drill something then go watch twitter, Lookin like who died
Glock on me that hold 30, Thats European sigh
Turn't rocking Balmains, Ain't rocking Levis

[Chorus: Lud Foe]
I'm a young dope selling with a felon
Riding round with Mac 11's
I ain't no a job so I robbed and sell dope
Her boyfriend mad I get guap and he broke
Sawed off shotty right up under my peacoat
I'm a young dope selling with a felon
Riding round with Mac 11's
I ain't no a job so I robbed and sell dope
Her boyfriend mad I get guap and he broke
Sawed off shotty right up under my peacoat
