[Hook]
Everyday I wake up I just stay on my level
I just want the money more just to make 'em more jealous
Seen some OGs in the past and the fame was (?)
I just write me up a check and sell some Mason Margielas
I don't know what to do, she ain't got me confused
I just want this shit forever and I don't want to lose
I just write me up a check and sell some Mason Margielas
I just write me up a check and sell some Mason Margielas

[Verse 1]
I done hit in Margielas I took his bitch in Margielas
I sold bricks in Margielas I poured a 6 to my brothers
Make it rain on 'em umbrella
Jimmy Choo but no fella
Free my niggas who felons I'm up 100 no stressin'
I skeet off in a 6, shooters with me no Penny
Green Margielas Like Grinch, I ain't worried 'bout nothin' like French
I'm two-four Marshawn Lynch, I wake up and count this money
Green Margielas for money I'm sippin' lean the color Barney
And I be flexin' ho
Think this shit funny tho
If I see it, I need those
Cancel that bitch I need to know
In my Margielas

[Verse 2]
Yeah you a fool you embrassed
Shinin' chain plenty carats
Balmains a thousand dollars I don't fuck with the Paris
Shoot to kill, send a message
Suck my dick 'cause she desperate
They took my niggas I felt it
Made sure (?) felt it
And I do need a sponsor
Check me out bitch I'm ballin'
When I ball out the jockey my Rollie game got 'em watchin'
My Margielas drippin' I'm saucin'
Tried to rob boy you lost it
Diamonds runnin' like faucet
Lil Durk he back on his boss shit
Let's get it!

[Bridge]
And I copped some Margielas
A bad bitch she yellow
Real bitch on her shit
She barely get jealous
And I ain't playin' 'cause she ready
Good head deserve her a medal
Let's get it, let's get it!
I step in Margielas
