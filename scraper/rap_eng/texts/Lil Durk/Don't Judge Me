They be tryna judge me
I thought that they loved me
But they don't really know me
Please don't judge me (don't judge), don't judge me (don't judge)
They be tryna judge me
They don't know my story
Tell me why they hate me
Don't judge me (don't judge me), don't judge me (don't judge me)

[Verse 1: Lil Durk]
Loyalty was the key to these street niggas (let's get it)
Chains, cars, cribs, since a kid I used to think I was Meech nigga
Starving, crib full of family I can't sleep without balling
So I watch D Rose play (often))
Aunty died from cancer so I rap to keep the laughs
I'd rather pray when I'm alone than steady giving shit to pastors
Daddy gone since I was in pampers, he get out when I'm a pimp
Old and a dead man, hands still on the hammer
Niggas talking 'bout they my mans and we friends
Where you was you at when that man with that lanz offered me ten?
Shackled up, with the niggas that we hit with the fan
Eating shit that we gathered in blan
President still black, I hope he change shit
Niggas out here fifty, doing the same shit
When he say he got my back it rain pit
Don't judge me, I know the streets love me (yeah, talk to 'em)

[Verse 2: Lil Durk]
Dope dealers, cold killers, they want niggas told nigga
Half them killers told on 'em, had my chopper and road with 'em
My mouth close though, I can't snitch on a nigga
Pillow talking to ops and hoes, bitch of a nigga
Summer nights, all them drugs made me kill shit
I lost so many niggas if they down I ain't feel shit
Been on IG with my nigga, the feel rent
Them niggas just made me, I kept it real with it and they ain't loyal though
Mind of a psycho twelve posted on light poles
Sold crack to the light though, going crazy I might though
RIP who I cry to, hold my hands on my head cause I got to
Yeah, I'm loyal nigga
