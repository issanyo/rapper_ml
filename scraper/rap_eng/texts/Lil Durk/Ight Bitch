(Lil Durk Hook)
I can’t love love no bitch that love my bro and shit
She say that she love me I don’t know the bitch
Bitch she 5 months pregnant she don’t know if its his
It ain't mine we bang brodies bitch
Ight bitch I ain't broke ass bitch
Ight bitch she ain't got no money I tell her like
Ight bitch you fuck my guys and I tell her
It ain't mine we bang bro that ho like ight bitch


(Brewski Verse)
Yo Durk this bitch is crazy wish I would of known
Before I fucked her now she blowing up my phone
Spending all this money alone
Different city different bitch no I’m not at home
I be oh so fly just like them pilots
Lookin fresher than fresh shout out my stylist
And you ain't got no bling bitch you iceless
Deal worth a couple milli, but Im priceless
Developed from the negatives like photos
Purple all up in my cup leanin like cholo
Baggin thotties bitch I feel like Froto
Im gucci and you just polo oh no
