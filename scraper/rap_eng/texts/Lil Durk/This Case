[Verse 1 : Lil Durk]
Call me my jewelry i need me a [?]
Spend money on hits, i pay for the shooters
I talk to the streets, this money amusing
They say they gonna kill me, but why they ain't do it
Get paper, quick paper
Brick case, free my brick layer
My rollie diamonds, they hit major
Rob me, I erase you
They talking on sight shit, you asking for indictments
Double cup give me brightness
Guns on some dike shit
Sip so much lean that I'm numb
Mama, I carry my gun
Can't end up like ricky
These niggas be hating on me because I'm boys n the hood
No gun, catch a body like Suge
This niggas be getting this money
They fucking with me my niggas we get the city turning up

[Verse 2 : Hypno Carlito]
The feds ain't picking up this case
I give em' the work like a mixtape
Carlito I got it I've been straight
I pick up the work like I lift weights
300 days and 300 nights
The feds wanna talk but I know my rights
Spend whatever on lawyers I don't want no life
Bitch I got the (?) like a motorbike
No I don't fuck with informants
I didn't do it I was touring
Don't come to my house with no warrant
Don't hit my line if it's not important
I spent a few bucks on my mortgage
Hope you get the pic like a portrait
Everything I do big like I'm like norbit
I son all these niggas like orphans
Hypno Carlito don't need no co-sign
Polish shit up thats why Lil durk just signed me
Play me and Varney you'll get you a line
I just made a million (?)
