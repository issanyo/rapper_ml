[Chorus]
Why the opposition callin' my line?
Tellin' me to come outside
I would, but I know they lyin'
(I been through this shit before, you know?)
Foe'nem told me keep my iron
My momma had a dream about me dyin'
I told her that I hope she lyin'
It's gon' be a homicide
It's gon' be a homicide
Fuck with Durk and they dyin' today (facts)
They told me they sick and tired
They don't want to die today

[Verse]
Whatever my niggas be wantin', know I got 'em (I got 'em)
I be off them drugs, addicted to narcotics (narcotics)
2012 niggas wasn't with me in the 'partments
I'ma take a risk, carry my guns inside my joggers (yeah yeah)
Why you steady playin' hoe? Let me be their father
Kill his ass in the streets, we hope they don't charge us (don't charge us)
We can't find your ass, we gon' kill your artist (On God)
And you know it's guaranteed when I say promise (yeah yeah)
And I got some shawtys that gon' shoot
They gon' do the shit you ain't gon' do
They gon' slide through your block, they make calls on you (Let's get it)
You hang with them and don't supposed to, it's gon' fall on you
Spit on me bad when I was down, I'ma ball on you
And you ain't thinkin' 'bout getting no money, til' it dawned on you (yeah yeah)
And nigga I'll drill for 'em (drill for 'em)
I ain't still signed to French but I'd kill for him (Let's get it)
Who said I ain't got no money, I'm like a mil' on
You tried to turn a hoe into a housewife, watch, she still goin' (still goin')
Voice of the trenches, talkin' for the streets (for the streets)
Teachers said I might be dead 'cause I love the streets (Bitch)
And she still told me that my grades above a B
The streets don't love anyone, but they in love with me
Fuck with me and it's a homicide
Try to clean my image with a turkey drive
Went in 18 he gettin' out when he like 35
2018 I'm goin' up, my shows a hundred racks (Damn)
Lie to you none, but in jail I say a hundred lies
How the fuck you mad, and I gave your ass a hundred tries? (ohh)
And from them brothers that I love, I dropped a hundred, why?
Don't feed your gang when they snake you, you gon' wonder why
Tryin' tuck my pride away (tryin' tuck my pride)
I ain't really tryin' to die today (I ain't really tryin' to die)
Certain shit I can't tolerate (no)

[Chorus]
Why the opposition callin' my line?
Tellin' me to come outside
I would, but I know they lyin'
(I been through this shit before, you know?)
Foe'nem told me keep my iron
My momma had a dream about me dyin'
I told her that I hope she lyin'
It's gon' be a homicide
It's gon' be a homicide
Fuck with Durk and they dyin' today (facts)
They told me they sick and tired
They don't want to die today
