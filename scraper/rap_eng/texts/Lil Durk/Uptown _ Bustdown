[Intro: XXXTENTACION]
You ain't fuckin' with PnB Rock, you're not fuckin' with me
If you from New York and you ain't fuckin' with Boogie
When I see you, I'm finna slap you
Niaggi, this that overseas drip

[Chorus: A Boogie wit da Hoodie]
Patek on my wrist, that's a bustdown
All I know is get it, I'm from Uptown
Bitches ain't shit, I left 'em stuck down
Only on my dick 'cause I'm up now
Only on my dick because I'm up now
She was with you first, but she with us now
All this Eliantte, shit be bust down
All your shit fugazi, let me find out
All your shit fugazi, let me find out
All your shit fugazi, let me find out
Bitches nowadays will get you lined now
Bitches nowadays be out of line

[Verse 1: PnB Rock]
AP on my wrist, that's a bustdown
We just caught an opp, that's a touchdown
Caught a nigga lackin', that's a man down
We was out in traffic with that automatic (Skrrt)
Told 'em they don't want no static, this shit can get tragic (Tragic)
Hit him all in his face, that's a closed casket (Yeah)
Told 'em they don't want no smoke, this shit get so drastic
Catch a case, Shaka beat that shit like he got magic

[Verse 2: Lil Durk]
Oh, I don't fuck with niggas 'cause they too fake (Let's get it)
I fuck with Boogie, I'm recordin' off a toothache (Yeah yeah)
Locked up for guns, had a killer for a roommate (Yeah yeah)
I called her, told her take a Plan B, say it's too late (Brrt)
I remember havin' shootouts on the E-way (On the E-Way)
9 and 22 call, I do a threeway (A threeway)
They closed BackPage down, she usin' eBay (Usin' eBay)
OTF or FTO, I use it each way (Gang)

[Verse 3: A Boogie wit da Hoodie]
OTF, HBTL, I fuck with New Lane
I used to ride the 4, the opps was on the 2 Train
Don't call my phone no more, lil' bitch, you not my boo thing
Don't call my phone no more, lil' bitch, I'm havin' mood swings
Ridin' with that HK, that's my goonie
I be in my zone, I'm in my two-three
I used to pop the Percs, thought I was loopy
It's me and Rock and Durk, this shit is too deep
And yeah we come in peace, don't want no drama
But when it come to defense, we got choppers
And when it come to reefer, we do grabba
They don't know low-key, yeah, I'm a rasta

[Chorus: A Boogie wit da Hoodie]
Patek on my wrist, that's a bustdown
All I know is get it, I'm from Uptown
Bitches ain't shit, I left 'em stuck down
Only on my dick 'cause I'm up now
Only on my dick because I'm up now
She was with you first, but she with us now
All this Eliantte, shit be bust down
All your shit fugazi, let me find out
All your shit fugazi, let me find out
All your shit fugazi, let me find out
Bitches nowadays will get you lined now
Bitches nowadays be out of line
