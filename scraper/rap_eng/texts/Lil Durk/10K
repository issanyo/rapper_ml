[Intro]

[Hook]
I give 10k to my shooters, they shoot
I give 10k to my Lawyers, Get them cases removed
I spent 10k on my watch, Trinidad James my jewels
I spent 10k on my ring, red bottom my shoe
I spent 10k (x8)
I spent 10k on my shooters, they shoot
I spent 10k on my lawyers, get them cases removed

[Verse]
My shooters don't fuck around
Hooker shit they gon' blow you down
Where I'm from we lay you down
Blue tips all on them AK rounds
My shooter gon' shoot some shit
My lil niggas don't fuck around
Blow you down, you do some shit
My lil niggas down fuck around
Ask about me anywhere, OTF bitch, we like the zoo
I be going anywhere where young niggas that like to shoot
Homicide all on my dick, it ain't nothing that I can do
Tell that shit to a snitch, I be Ray Charles when I'm in the zoo
30's and Ninas, that Opp like a drought
Pour a 4 now I'm leaning shoot the club now I'm out
I'm Chiraq where I'm at, where other city's show out
And they know about 3hunnid, if they don't then I'm out

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
You get killed if you mention
You'll get killed for attention
Free my hittaz that's hitting
Fuck a judge, Fuck the system
Fuck the feds, Fuck P.D
Fuck a friend, Fuck a opp
Fuck your bitch, Fuck a block
Fuck that money, that's marked
Say my name bring the city out
I'll make a call bring them hittas out
Bet it all on my niggas, that mean I'm bringing a milli out
When I flex bring the billy's out, benzes and raris
Chiraq where it's real, where we shoot up the party
These bitches is set up, make one move and get wet up
See my niggas keep wetters, tell them niggas to catch up
Make a name in the streets, make sure ain't nobody test us
And you get drilled when there's beef, and you get gon' if you mess up

[Hook]
