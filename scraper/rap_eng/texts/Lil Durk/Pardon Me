[Intro]
(This is a DJ Bandz world premiere)
Hello thank you come again

[Chorus]
Pardon me, pardon me
Pardon me
What you say lil boy don’t talk to me
Pardon me, pardon me
Back turned on these niggas better pardon me
Pardon me Pardon me
What you say lil boy don’t talk to me
Pardon me, Pardon me

[Verse 1]
Fuck being friends I want many kids
I'm stunting in a Benz tho
I got another bandz tho
All these dead presidents filling my wrist
Don’t take out for the plug don’t beat it like kimble
Real shooters real killers nigga
One call they will kill nigga
A bitch kill him kill bill nigga
Any city I'm still trill nigga
City bought a drink up tryna roll a stink up
Ops tryna link up twitter don’t mean nothing
Fifty deep in the club niggas start mean mugging
I'm a Ray Charles to the homicide ain’t seen nothing
Off these drugs I'm still wilding
It’s why the devil still silent
Real nigga in my blood, got Bloods and Crips out in Cali
Free all ma savages ma youngins ain’t having it
Roll up a bag with them plug ma youngins ain’t passing shit
Throw throw throw , catch a op and we dump
Ma youngins ain’t pressing shit
Court a bitch smash a bitch
Ma niggas ain’t having this
Pardon me, pardon me

[Chorus]
Pardon me, pardon me
Pardon me
What you say lil boy don’t talk to me
Pardon me, pardon me
Back turned on these niggas better pardon me
Pardon me pardon me
What you say lil boy don’t talk to me
Pardon me, pardon me

[Verse 2]
Maybe three l smoke [?] so I'm going with the flow
Microphone need a coke
Made money went broke
Ene me penny mo
Bitch out of control steady testing the fold
Really wanna do the most
Seen me I'm chucking deuces
Old school on some new shit
You ain’t really with this shit
Why you haters talking shit
Nigga this just hollow talks
Project lot of roaches, now I'm out of Hollywood
I'm a hot boy like I came from Hollygrove without [?]
Holly hoop a lot of hoes
Treat em all like dominos
I can’t hear you though loud I'm smoking on
Money in the pockets lil nigga got a lot a rolls
A1 nigga never been on the honor roll
(go to school on em )
Bitch real thick can’t fit in a lot of clothes
She’d make me rich if I put her on the payroll
You ain’t know shit I'm the man cause I say so
(yeah)

[Chorus]
Pardon me, pardon me
Pardon me
What you say lil boy don’t talk to me
Pardon me, pardon me
Back turned on these niggas better pardon me
Pardon me pardon me
What you say lil boy don’t talk to me
Pardon me, pardon me
