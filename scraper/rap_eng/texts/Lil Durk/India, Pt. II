Shawty squeeze in them jeans
Touch her knees, make her scream
I sip lean, I sip lean
Gucci sneaks, shopping sprees
Shawty, she my cup of tea
Please, don't give up on me
Lord, got me shopping rings, so cold
And I think you know
What you doing to my mind and my soul
I popped a lot of pills, I freak you like I will
She ain't let me miss no meal
My feelings in it for real
For real, for real, for real, for real
For real, for real, for real, for real, yeah
Girl, I'm so for real, the first time was a hell of a night
I'ma spoil you for whatever, have whatever you like (Hahaha)
I say I won't fall in love, but I was never so right
I seen you fall in love with goofys, I was never yo' type
I told my mom, you a make a hell of a wife
I know they mad we live a hell of a life
Trust issues, so confused
It's me and you, fuck the rules
I wanna suck your toes, baby, take off your shoes (Yeah)
They say I'm nasty 'cause I wanna lick your ass cheek
This yo' last chance, hit that handstand, make that ass dance
Who yo man is? Off that Xanax, have some dry sex (Yeah)

[Interlude: India & Lil Durk]
Nobody understands why we love each other the way we do
(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
But it ain't for them to understand
We not out here tryna be relationship goals
(Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
This real, we don't care about none of that internet stuff
(Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
We don't care about none of that shade
(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
People seem to always shade what they wish they had
(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
We make each other happy
(Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
We keeping around whatever makes us happy
(Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
And why it makes us happy is our business

[Chorus]

Ooh, you know you got it
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Ooh, you know you nasty
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, she knows she got it
