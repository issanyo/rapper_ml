[Lil Durk]
Niggas say they poppin' me
Stash box I popped a C
My first check I copped a Jeep
I protest to smoke the weed
Niggas say they robbin' me
Niggas say they stoppin' me
Nigga ain't no probably
Yes I got the Glock on me
Got them oppas in my wood
Wish a fuck nigga would
Pull up on Durk in the hood
You gon' really see what's good
And they'd kill me if they could
Ain't no safety for that .22
Gotta be Jordan for this ball
How this yo' city you ain't got no power
If you catch me lackin' would you pull
Nigga you don't know nothin' 'bout no war
For real, shoot through the door, score yeah
Percocets all I'ma pour yeah
100 racks in the floor yeah
Send that boy to that morgue yeah
Trappin' off a 'droid yeah
30 shot Glock my sword yeah
