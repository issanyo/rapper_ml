[Intro: Lil Durk & YFN Lucci]
The niggas don't know what the bottom feel like
I want sum day ones, I want a couple of niggas too, you know
Day ones dem the niggas I used to fuck, ya dig
Yeaaa

[Hook: Lil Durk & YFN Lucci]
I just lost my nigga this summer
First hundred thou', like look at this money
I tell 'em all the time, who seen it comin'
We really, really, really came from nothin' like
I told my boys we rich forever
I told my boys we rich forever
Even though I do rappin', man we rich together
I told my boys we rich forever
You know what the fuck goin' on nigga
YFNBC nigga
Yeaa uh

[Verse 1: YFN Lucci]
Ay I came from nothin'
Caught sum stains as a yungin'
I had to flip an onion
Now might blow a brick in onyx
My nigga B showed me the road, but ain't shit get funny
My nigga Nut said I got it now, why they take him from me
I'm tryna face a fuck nigga, he had faith in a young nigga
My heart racin', I gotta take it so I'mma make for my niggas
You gotta crawl before you walk and have patience young nigga
Yea, some days I feel like you waste a mil nigga
So I'm fed up, killa keep on tellin' me keep my head up
Four shows a week, a nigga way up
So we gon' be rich forever, got my niggas forever, yea yea

[Verse 2: Lil Durk]
Street nigga wit label money, free Charles, he stayed 100
See Nuski, they took 'em from me, free Glocks for everybody
Just use 'em for whoever want it, 200 to California
Hooded y'all on that corner, I die for this Arizona
Appeal money for 10 niggas, can't say no I gotta get it
Ain't got grammys but got grams
Hit the road and go get it
Dthang wit me, where his
Number one sellin' urban
I do it I like I do hits
Losing niggas the worse
BM don't want me wit cus
She like my cup, she dirty
But me, I can't change
I tell her ain't that perfect
I came from shit, I came from mud, nothin'
You ain't blood, but we mud brothas
I lost my niggas, I say fuck summer
Go, ay!
