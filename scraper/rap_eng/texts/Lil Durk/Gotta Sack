[Hook: Chief Keef]
I got a sack now
Try us, it’s mac rounds
Call us 30 clips, shawty blow your back down
You can’t turn me down
‘Cause this is that loud
I ain't the mans, bitch?
Shit, how that sound?

Just for a fact, now
I got a sack now
I love to stunt, bitch
I act a ass, now (x2)

[Verse 1: Lil’ Durk]
I got a sack, now
Free Five now
Since I got a name, you can check my background
Just ‘cause I rap now
Can’t put that mack down
‘Cause I’m stacked up, try to rob me and get clapped down
I claim OTF, I claim O-Block
Got 300 guns, blow at your block
I’m a young nigga
Send shots at your block
Fuck a opp, die cops — we on top
We ‘bout that bullshit
Like D. Rose
Call numbanine, free D-Rose
I got a sack now
Don’t trick to these hoes
I got a sack now
Don’t trick to these hoes

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Chief Keef]
Act a ass now
Where my cash now
Where them bricks, now?
Sit your ass down
Where the loud at?
Shit, I need it now
Or else the mack rounds
Blow your ass down
Don’t try us like we punks we so fuckin’ dangerous
I’m sitting at the top fuck nigga face it
These bitches at my shows came to stare at me
It's a O in OTF but ain't no O in we

On the low, ho
I love to stunt, bitch
My bitches multiply
I can’t fuck with one bitch

[Hook]
