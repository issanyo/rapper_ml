[Hook: Shy Glizzy]
In love with a white girl
She's soft as powder
I get hard around her
I whip her right here
She French, I'm a coke boy
Don't fuck with broke boys
She know I'm a dope boy
She said get me dope, boy
[x2]

[Verse 1: Shy Glizzy]
I seen 15 bricks today
You make 15 bucks an hour
Robbin ass niggas in the kitchen, playing with flour
I got all this power, you a fucking coward
My bitch come from France, ooh, she like my Eiffel Tower
Oops
My plug got them blocks, just like LuLu
I supply your block, I give you work and tell you do you
You no fool, you know that the Glizzy Gang will shoot you
We're not backing down, we not run from shit but woo woo
Cocaine, that's my bitch, ooh, she made me rich
I wanna be like rich these niggas wanna be like mitch
In the kitchen, when I cook a wankle wankle wip
Free my dawg they book 'em just like Michael Michael Vick

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Lil Durk]
White girl, white xan, white swirl, white world
Trap house jumpin', get money
I mix it, I whip it, I bag it, I ship it
Get off in a day or two
And free my niggas in the fed
Free the block what they'll do
I'm a dope boy, better know boy
French 40, coke boys
Spend money on what you like
Free young Chopo, I'm on the block doe
Really clocked doe, got a Glock doe
Cuz he don't smoke
And I know he pussy and he won't blow
My niggas shoot doe, Katy Perry shit
Bitch its two door, 20K a show
And they pay us doe, I know they hate us doe
And I made it doe, free bro
Real nigga for life, real nigga better say it twice
Real nigga, real nigga

Cuz I feel like we made it

Yeah, we cookin' white girl
