(Hook) : I see a opp I take his life for him
We rob and kill that's that shit that Im on
Can't trust a soul that's why I keep that pipe on (x2)
Im on that's that shit that shit that Im on, can't trust a soul that's why I keep that pipe on
Im on that's that shit that Im on
I see an opp Ima take his life for him
(Verse: 1)
Rob a nigga quick that's what im on
Pounds of that lawn know is ice on
Make-a-face time him like an iPhone
My nigga took 15 wait till law wrong, roll the belt backwards throw the L's up
Avoid the drama, I neva tell none
I be on the block, where they'll drill sum
My Lil niggas ready to kill sum
Don't let this rap shit come up and fool ya
I got my tools up and im a hitta (x2)
You run up on me and your are finished (L's)

(Hook): I see a opp I take his life for him
We rob and kill that's that shit that Im on
Can't trust a soul that's why I keep that pipe on (x2)
Im on that's that shit that shit that Im on, can't trust a soul that's why I keep that pipe on
Im on that's that shit that Im on
I see an opp Ima take his life for him

(Verse: 2)

Niggas get confused with this rap bath
Bitch im in the streets im in traffic
Nigga run up on me then it's tragic
That drama leaves his ass in a casket
Gucci belt and Gucci bandana
That hamma got a banana
That choppa chop him down French Montana
My Robbas posted like bandanas
O.T.F that's what im on
300 shit that's what im on
Niggas claimin numbas bitch you been on, niggas tryna make it bitch we been on

(Hook)
