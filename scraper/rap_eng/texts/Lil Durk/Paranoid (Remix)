[Intro: Rick Ross & Diddy)]
Real nigga walk through, been real
Dream Team, lot of cake
Coke Boy, Black Bottle Boys, Bad Boy
Ciroc lifestyle, Yo, check this out

[Verse 1: Diddy]
I been getting high since '94
Money from the ceiling down to the floor
I see myself, I can't trust no more
Damn, I'm so paranoid!

[Pre-Verse 2: Rick Ross & Diddy]
I got this my nigga
I make big money, I drive big cars (I got this my nigga)
Everybody know me, it's like I'm a movie star!
This some real shit right here, let me take 'em back
Bullets ripping through my door like I was Biggie, nigga
But my vodou strong enough for 50 niggas, that's 50 niggas
Let's hold hands nigga, let's get this money nigga
Yah! Ou paka bat mwen!

[Verse 2: Rick Ross]
Bullets ripping through my door like I was Biggie, nigga
But my vodou strong enough for 50 niggas
Skyscraper, my bitches be tall as ceilings
So it's only right we looking down on niggas
Started as a indie, now we 50 million
I got bury money, my bitch watching Wendy Williams
Bulletproof my SUV, it burn a lot of gas
Send black folk to your city just to drop a body bag
You talking but my niggas speak a different code
Women love me, say my dick feel like it's dipped in gold
Diamonds on my fingers like I'm Liberace
How many of you niggas really been a papi?
So callate la boca, baby
See gordito with some refugees off the coast of Haiti
Mastermind (Mastermind), it's on the way (it's on the way)
We run the game (we run the game) 800 ways (800 ways)!

[Hook: Johnny Maycash]
I be so (I be so) paranoid (paranoid)
I hear these niggas tryin' to fuck with me
But, real shit, I know I got enemies
I can't let them niggas into me
I ain't scared to die, nigga, huh
I'll take your life, nigga
Fuckin' shoot 'em down, nigga
A hundred rounds'll blow you down, nigga

[Verse 3: Lil Durk]
Let's get it, paranoia got me feeling woozy
Copped a uzi, clip hanging over like the movies
Say your statements, how you telling scripts long as movies
I'm a wild nigga, I'm a wild nigga
Last time I broke sweat, it was trial, nigga
State game, I rolled 50, lost trial, nigga
Daddy gone, I was a lost child, nigga
Found God when I payed my first vows, nigga
I married the streets, kissed my mama goodbye
She said "17?", the way she thinking, had dreams I'mma die
Real nigga for life (real nigga for life), so paranoid (so paranoid)
Connect had hit me, he got shooters in California

[Verse 4: Chinx Drugz]
Since they killed Stack from this building, I relocated my children
Hope his shooter step forth and just make his debut appearance
They try to lock up my kind, scared to pick up my line
My phone tapped like Avon, my Cuban link like Raekwon
These streets all that I know, my block hot like pyro
All we know is "get it" so, nigga, if you scared, call 5-0
Finna go bulletproof all of my whips
Watch what I say when I lay with my bitch
Cause when that shit hit the fan and them choppers start blamming
She pro'ly be down with the hit, boy!

[Hook]
I be so (I be so) paranoid (paranoid)
I hear these niggas tryin' to fuck with me
But, real shit, I know I got enemies
I can't let them niggas into me
I ain't scared to die, nigga, huh
I'll take your life, nigga
Fuckin' shoot 'em down, nigga
A hundred rounds'll blow you down, nigga


[Verse 5: French Montana]
Ay, I-I be the hottest nigga out my city
Hit you with some shit you never seen on Tiffany's
Know a nigga shining, all my diamonds pretty
I-I-I hit a lick, I'm worth a couple million
Ay, that car n'it 400 thou', nigga
That top drop like Pacquiao, nigga
I-I-I hit up K.O.D. and left a hundred in it
Hundred on my watch, I'm shining every minute
They-they-they caught him on that corner, left a hundred in him
Niggas goin' broke, that'll never be me
That-that paranoia (paranoia), got me watchin' lawyer (watchin' lawyer)
Molly water (molly water), tryna wake up sober!

[Verse 6: Jadakiss]
I keep my hitter with me, that's my shooter, nigga
Only thing I'm scared of is what he'll do to niggas
Just for the love, I'mma do it with ya
Closed casket, let 'em come and view a picture
Yeah, it's amazing how the time fly
Yeah, the hate is at a all-time high
Yeah, I got them things in the hood working
Uh, death is the only thing certain
F-Y-I, I ain't scared to die
Ain't afraid to lose and I ain't scared to try
Game of destroyer, retain a lawyer
Federal indictment, that's paranoia, what?
