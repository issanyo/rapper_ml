I was born real, that's how I'm gone die
Nigga say he real but I know he a lie
Momma used to worry, baby you ain't gotta cry
It ain’t nothing but killers by my side
Down to ride
I be out here every night, every night, every night
I be out here every night, every night, every night
I be out here every night, every night, every night
I be out here every night, every night, every night

[Verse 1]
She wanna suck on my ethika

Pop out the cut with the fifty
Ape on me, feel like I'm fifty
Smoking on opps I get trippy
You said I was broke, boy you kidding
I feel like a hero this H on me
Bitches be dying just to taste on me
The feds put a rico case on me
Fifty a show its not make believe

Pour me a eight in a samp
Wanna feel my pain just sip
Wanna feel my pain just sip
You wanna feel my pain just sip
You wanna feel my pain just sip
