[Hook]
I waited for you (2x)
I cried out with no reply
And I can't feel you by my side

[Verse 1: Lil Durk]
How can I not fuck with the niggas I grew up with
Damn gunner hunters every time I see em
Hasta la vista, nah cause I'm coming back
I love to rap, I love the trap
Mama tripping but she know I'm strapped
The city want me dead, money on my head
On nuski i ain't scared I'm going (to the crib)
No cash so I had to steal nigga
Ain't feel it was too real niggas
Even nights I wanted to kill niggas
Plenty nights I ain't even feel niggas
Always kept it hunnid like a bread
Gimme guns when I ain't had no sets
Ain't been back since
Ever since niggas on tricks, fuck em
The streets on fire
Gotta keep my pole on me
My old homie told on me
Keep my gold on me
They'll kill me before they rob me
But they know I ain't going homie
They know I ain't going homie

[Hook]
I cried out with no reply
And I can't feel you by my side
(2x)

[Verse 2: Lil Durk]
Grew up in the ghetto the hard way
Pipes in the hallway
Where youngins be turning to killers
And killing these niggas in broad day
Me? I went the smart way
Started rapping for the large cake
House on the hill
Ain't worried bout a deal
Imma do it the hard way
Imma turn up for my real niggas
And get money with my real niggas
Since I was a young nigga
They knew I was a problem
Imma get money and keep it real (2x)
Keep it trill
Fuck a deal
Bitch I'm paid
Yeah, Yeah (2x)
Bitch I'm paid

[Durk Talking]
I just wanna keep it real for me niggas man
Everybody get this money man
So imma turn up with em

[Hook]
I cried out with no reply
And I can't feel you by my side
(2x)
I waited for you
(2x)
