[Intro: Omelly]
What’s up with these fuck niggas?
I heard you niggas talking
Well I just bought me a fucking new drum nigga
Fresh out the box nigga
Glock work
I’m still standing over the stove nigga
Clock work
We squeeze till it’s empty nigga

[Verse 1: Omelly]
I’m a real nigga, I play by the rules
Y’all some fake niggas, can’t walk in my shoes
Try do what I do, move how I move
I stay with the rule, stomp him out then take his shoes
I’m still in the kitchen, I’m whipping shit up, it’s Omelly the chef
Got your bitch scuffing her knees
She suck on this dick till she can’t catch her breath
Till her eyes water
Pussy like an ocean so I dive on her
And my bitch know how to dance
So fuck dollar bills, I throw fives on her
I throw dimes on her, fiftys and dubs
It’s Osama twin llamas, hating on us makes your bitch want to fuck
Girl what’s up, I don’t even drink, but we can get drunk
Imma always be a real nigga
Shout out to killers and the drug dealers
Got to stay true to your block, can’t leave the strip until the bricks get done
When you out here in the mix flipping shit, first thing you better get you a gun
Just bought a Glock 26 for a stack fuck nigga, and it came with a drum

[Chorus: Omelly]
Ohh, nigga we don’t play them games
Couple shots’ll hit your top, knock out your brains
You ain’t talking money, what you saying
Ohh, nigga what you saying
Ohh, nigga we don’t play them games
Couple shots’ll hit your top, knock out your brains
You ain’t talking money, what you saying
Ohh, nigga what you saying

[Verse 2: Lil Durk]
Let’s get it, bullet run up, knock a nigga top off
Top off, top off, circle full of reals, we don’t fuck with knockoff
Police coming round better not talk (better not talk, nigga shut up!)
Nigga try to rob then it’s all choppers
Homicide, and we come for you
Homicide and we come for you
Make one call, they gon run for you
Hello? OTF DC nigga, OTF DC nigga
Free NumbaNine and free Meek nigga
Head shot, left em traumatized
[?] circle, nigga lot of guys
Lot of money and a lot of iron
Shots fired, then a lot dying
[?] keep this straight nigga
I don’t really like fuck with fake niggas
And I don’t fuck with snake niggas
You see it, I want it, I got it, I take it, nigga

[Chorus: Omelly]
Ohh, nigga we don’t play them games
Couple shots’ll hit your top, knock out your brains
You ain’t talking money, what you saying
Ohh, nigga what you saying
Ohh, nigga we don’t play them games
Couple shots’ll hit your top, knock out your brains
You ain’t talking money, what you saying
Ohh, nigga what you saying
