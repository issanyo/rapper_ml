Split the wig of a bitch if he disrespecting my kin
But I don't need to flinch if he disrespecting my kin
There gon be violence if he disrespecting my kin
Turn meat to mince then dip if he disrespecting my kin
Split the wig of a bitch if he disrespecting my kin
But I don't need to flinch if he disrespecting my kin
There gon be violence if he disrespecting my kin
Turn meat to mince then dip if he disrespecting my kin

Me and my kinfolk are ready, for any shots that you're sending
You out for five nights like freddys, after we done stomped your head in
Turning ya head to spaghetti, and you're thought process is empty
Fuck with us it will end badly, fuck with us it will end deadly
Leave your body on your ground, and your head out on the pavement
Everybody gather around, come see the road that i'm paving
The wave that i'm making, the flow that i'm waving
The game that i'm breaking, the game that i'm changing

Genius or insanity like a solo game of chess
Free the bitch from her vanity, grab her heart through her chest
Plead the fifth cos it's scary to me that all of my ideas
Are easily influenced by what the others express
Like fuck trump, fuck hillary, and fuck all the rest
For some reason I just can't seem to use my head
I don't even like rap or even hip-hop I guess
I just like what the guy with the fucking mic says

Split the wig of a bitch if he disrespecting my kin
But I don't need to flinch if he disrespecting my kin
There gon be violence if he disrespecting my kin
Turn meat to mince then dip if he disrespecting my kin
Split the wig of a bitch if he disrespecting my kin
But I don't need to flinch if he disrespecting my kin
There gon be violence if he disrespecting my kin
Turn meat to mince then dip if he disrespecting my kin

Less fortunate individuals, struggling in the streets
Bless all of it little village of kiddies tryna eat
Do what morris did, Do what morris did
Do what morris did, Do what morris did
Escape from this hell hole, prove all naysayers wrong
You will make it, if you change the way that you roll
The rest of the world are slave traders to these eight gradin
Great players where they may serve great dangers to the same players

As them, let them in. Let them play the game
That will let them live. Provide for future kids and their kids futures
Yeah these kids be looking stick thin, we be Rasputia's
They got a lotta dead, and we gotta lot of bruises
That's so fucked up how we are so clueless
In the streets acting ruthless because they are roofless
The new youth on new drugs that they never knew of
To escape their peeping eyes from the clans of the Ku Klux
