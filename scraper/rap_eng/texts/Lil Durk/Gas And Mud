[Intro: Lil Durk]
See, I popped me a Xan
And that lean, that shit got me on Pluto (uh)
And I'm smokin' on that dope
And it got me on Pluto

[Hook]
Leanin'
I'm smokin' dope
That molly water
Or a molly
I pop a flat
I'm turnin' up
Don't come if you
Ain't got it all
I'm smoke
I'm leanin'
I'm sleepy
Can't think
I'm smokin' dope, smokin' dope, smokin' dope
I'm leanin' leanin' leanin' leanin' leanin'

[Verse 1: Lil Durk]
Drug, drug, drugs, sleepin' off them Xannies
She wanna turn up, got her off the shit
And out her panties
Ain't gotta spike her with the molly
She done came ready
Light up a Bob Marley
Smokin' dead niggas
Bottom of my shoe the colour red nigga
Don't turn up
Let them drugs get to yo head nigga
Pool party, lotta lean, lotta smokes
Lotta money, lotta bitches, lotta jokes
One hunnid 3 times, ain't no 3 packs in Newport
Can't keep up with my fashion
Cuz your money too short
From LA, MIA, all the way to New York
I be off them druuuuggggssss
But, I can't feel my face
I po'd a fourth up in that Crush
No razor blade but that lean I got better not be cut
I'll call up my connect
I need some gas and mud
Cuz he know I love my druuuuggggssss

[Verse 2: Lil Durk]
Drivin', window down
Hit me, wake me up
Get in my feelings, that molly
Those niggas is fake as fuck
OG? Show me some OG, lemme take a puff
Lean-man, who every time I hit em he meet me up
You don't drink so lemme pint up that deadly
That Patron hit me strong
I mix that light wit that RÃ©my
Now you see nothin' but the top and the back of her Remy
Just chew me up
Now you deserve you some Jimmy's
Now fuck for fame
You might go and get you some Fendi
Don't love me
Bitch you know you love you them pennies
Now my eyes closed
Smokin' on that hydro
Now I'm wide awoke
Molly got me grind mode
I can't move slow
Lean got me on Pluto
Imma dog like Cujo
Now tell me bitch is you broke?
Bitch yo pocket is a joke
And my block give ya smoke
Nahh
I ain't off them druuuuggggssss
