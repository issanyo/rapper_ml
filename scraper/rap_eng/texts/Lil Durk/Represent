[Hook x2: Wale]
Represent
Take a picture, just a naked, just a flick
For a nigga, she'll probably kill a bitch
My people's, my people's
I see both

[Verse 1: Wale]
You've been rooting for a nigga for a minute
But to do this here exclusively, I lose you in a second
And your views are independent, but your friends gossip
See even if I kept my nose clean, they'd still claim it's snot up
Ok I love the fact that she loyal, and she love the fact that I get beat
And I love the fact that she huh, cause she love the fact I get beat
See love is making her weak is making her think she maybe need me
But the thought of making me stay is making me think I maybe need to leave
If I told you that I love you would you listen
Probably meant it if said it, yeah I'm sippin'
But that liquor, bring the honesty out a nigga
She got me, then I'mma get her

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Lil Durk]
Look at her in her eyes, can't trust her 'round my guys
That faithful shit don't work, can't let her feed me them lies
But I always represent, for me she killed a bitch
I buy expensive shit, it's me she rocking wit'
Gucci, Louie, Fendi, she deserve all that
Her friends they kinda hate me, cause I think I'm all that
White coupe cloth roof, and the car shaking
It's just me and you, but we could add Franklin's
I represent like lawyers, I ball so hard like Jordan
I take a pic I promise, I'm Range Rover sportin'
She like heaven in my eyes, my bitch in disguise
And I ain't gotta lie, the days of my life

[Hook]
