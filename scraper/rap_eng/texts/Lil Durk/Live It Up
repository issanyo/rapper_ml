Live It Up, Live It Up, Live It Up
You gotta Live It Up
X24

[Verse 1]
Live it up, run up on him better give it up
It's a stick up, 911 ain't pickin' up
A nigga like me don't give no fuck
All of my cars, all of my clothes, all of my hoes I got it
Everything could be gone like magic
I know alot of niggas die for that fabric
Pretend your nigga let it happen
Whatchu' gon do?
Eveytime I see you with a gun, is you gon' shoot?
Too many niggas be hatin, too many niggas be faking
'But in these streets too many niggas won't make it
Got killers in M.I.A I'm talking straight Jamaicans
If you come through talking about bricks, my niggas a take it
Them hiccups the mac that I got a give you a face lift
No soulja boy my shooters on deck, ain't even got to say shit
Not a word not a sentence not a paragraph
Broke ass niggas I hate they ass
Straight 8 jeep boy im turning fast
'But all my niggas can't turn on them
So Imma Live it up, live it up , live it up
Sippin this lean go and get a cup x5
For that price my niggas gon hit em up
Lets get it!

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Imma street nigga wit all you need Books, bonds and lawyer fees
Its just us no state over seas
I'm gettin money over seas
Now I gotta take care of all my niggas
A lot of these niggas don't feed the killas
For a G or two my young niggas go get him
No boxer wit this tommy hill figure
Live it up, betta turn down nigga
You wit your niggas, go turn down witchu yall
Like a smoker I can't turn down swisher
'But if you get left, my nigga get switched up
He ain't even know it, but I know that he switched up
I know that he switched up, like juice did bishop
Can't no nigga ever say I bitched up
He tellin I know it don't get it mixed up
Now back to the blueprint I heard he got robbed and he ain't do shit
And yall knew this? pull up on the ghost on some spook shit
We creep through the gangway Hands full of choppers and Ak's
I hope you aim straight
No Pac,  Brenda still having a bae bae
So watch where you shoot
