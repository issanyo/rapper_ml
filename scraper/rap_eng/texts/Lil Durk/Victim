[Pre-Hook: Lil Durk]
Long nights in the trenches, get it
Cooking dope in my momma kitchen
Serving junkies kill the whole city
December nights turn me cold nigga
Never rat the street cold nigga
Never been a Rico nigga
Bought a plug the keys lil nigga
Jewelry cost a kilo nigga

[Hook: Lil Durk]
Don't fall victim, victim, victim, victim, victim, victim
Don't fall victim, victim, victim, victim, victim, victim
Don't fall victim, victim, victim, victim, victim, victim
Don't fall victim, victim, victim, victim, victim, victim

[Verse 1: Lil Durk]
Came from the trenches
December 24th we had wet shit
Don't fall out over no bitches
You saving these hoes we villians
We used to hit licks on mansions
Split the whole shit down the middle
Four guns and one rental
Everybody shoot pistols
We just rapping to clean the money
Before this booth we was serving junkies
Where I'm from these streets are hungry
And we got guns like we serve the country
Drillnois just kill the noise
Killers with me and they unemployed
In my prime I'm a younger Floyd
Made a 20 off another droid
Hit the trap I might buy a birdie
Call Obama this shit is urgent
Got some kids out here thats hurtin'
Got some kids out here thats servin'
Got some kids out here that purgin'
Been through this shit I ain't never nervous
And my cup is forever dirty
And my life is forever dirty

[Pre-Hook: Lil Durk]
Long nights in the trenches, get it
Cooking dope in my momma kitchen
Serving junkies kill the whole city
December nights turn me cold nigga
Never rat the street cold nigga
Never been a Rico nigga
Bought a plug the keys lil nigga
Jewelry cost a kilo nigga

[Hook: Lil Durk]
Don't fall victim, victim, victim, victim, victim, victim
Don't fall victim, victim, victim, victim, victim, victim
Don't fall victim, victim, victim, victim, victim, victim
Don't fall victim, victim, victim, victim, victim, victim

[Verse 2: Lil Durk]
Trigger finger, itchy, itchy, itchy
In the trenches getting money with me
Fucking bitches get them in they feelings
Fuck 'em raw just so she can feel it
Dope boy got the kitchen whippin
Drum nuts looking like mickey
Tweakin' nigga think you smoking mickey
Shot the muzzle drill the whole city
Grammy got love for you yeah
[?]  blood for you yeah
Say you was down in the mud for you yeah
Them niggas a motherfucker yeah
I was there when Fo'nem got booked
I was there when Rio got cooked
I was there when the war first started
I was there when blocks got took
Snitch niggas brought the nation down
Get out they gotta face it now
Red nose boy I hate a clown
Real killers they go chasing down
So don't fall victim, victim, victim, victim, victim, victim
Get killed if you wit' them, wit' them, wit' them, wit' them, wit' them, wit' them
