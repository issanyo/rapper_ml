[Verse1]
Durk keep doing what u doing for the city and the streets my niggas
300 days, 300 nights
Chief
Goooon Squad
Solid 400
Shite crazy
300 nights, 3 on the rari, never 3 on the ice
Durk you taking off
Save room for me on the flights
It’s been the minute since these niggas heard me on the mike
[?] cakes got all the cake, so we want a slice
Executive suites for the executives

[Verse2]
Oh shit, the new crib looks like a fortress
It is gorgeous
Tell the waitress we gonna need more cres
Fresh out the [?] to the [?]
Dirk I hope you record this
Put some pressure on them nigga
Saving little man
I’m walking down the streets till they braces and [?]
Get out of them water with them shorts [?]
The chopper make them popping shit like it ain't never
It gon never end
I ain't your friend
I ain't your man
I ain't your homie
Hit me on these songs, make you feel like you know me
When the shits getting real
Real war with the police
I don’t feel rehabilitated
I’m feeling like you [?] me
But you big face honies,on that  big face [?]
I ball hard in the streets
This road is like my trophy
