[Chorus]
I know I ain't worried, I ain't stressin' 'bout no money
I do shit for niggas and they act like they don't love me
When I turn my head, be the same niggas slug me
Love when Steve got it 'cause I know that boy like Curry
Shoot somethin'
How you 'round me always broke, don't wanna do nothin'?
And I watched you sell your pole for like two hundred
And that's a cluck move
Plenty nights it was me and you, I was screaming fuck you

[Verse 1]
And I grew up 'round them youngins, I said fuck school
Only me and you was trappin', we had much room
And I was zoned off them perkies, you off mushrooms
And I told 'em if they touch you they in trouble
Ain't no city like Chicago 'cause we home of them gangsters
Rob everything that move, we was pullin' them capers
I'm talking dice games
When bro 'nem opened up the trap, I seen them hypes came
My two hoes stay with some strap, it's a dyke thing
Got a hundred on my neck
Hundred on my wrist, Audemar, no Patek
Came from the bottom, yeah I felt the neglect
Juvenile nigga, I was desperate for sex

[Chorus]
I know I ain't worried, I ain't stressin' 'bout no money
I do shit for niggas and they act like they don't love me
When I turn my head, be the same niggas slug me
Love when Steve got it 'cause I know that boy like Curry
Shoot somethin'
How you 'round me always broke, don't wanna do nothin'?
And I watched you sell your pole for like two hundred
And that's a cluck move
Plenty nights it was me and you, I was screaming fuck you

[Verse 2]
She was VHS, rockin' VVS's
Steady catchin' blessings, I don't get rejected
Homicides got worser, body count went up
Can't ride around regular, car tinted up
The way this fifty blowin' you would think it was ten of us
I talked to Lauren and jail call in the Bentley truck
Heard that rumor I got shot and I got hemmed up
Even though I'm ten toes, won't give near' fucks
Hoodie on, skully on, mob Corleone
And they couldn't find a witness, Von gon' be home
He ain't wanna keep attendance 'cause his days was long
Came from nothing, who'd of thought what we'd get paid for shows?

[Chorus]
I know I ain't worried, I ain't stressin' 'bout no money
I do shit for niggas and they act like they don't love me
When I turn my head, be the same niggas slug me
Love when Steve got it 'cause I know that boy like Curry
Shoot somethin'
How you 'round me always broke, don't wanna do nothin'?
And I watched you sell your pole for like two hundred
And that's a cluck move
Plenty nights it was me and you, I was screaming fuck you
