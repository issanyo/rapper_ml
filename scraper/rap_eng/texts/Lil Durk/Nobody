[Intro: Lil Durk & Ann Marie]
(Nobody)
Nobody nobody nobody (nobody)
Nobody nobody nobody (nobody)

[Verse 1: Ann Marie]
Baby, I swear that this is all somethin' new
Nobody's made me feel the way you do
See you came in and changed the game
'Cause boy I never felt this way
'Cause niggas never got as close as you
And I think that you know it
And I think that you know it, boy you got me so open
Us together, boy we winnin'
Us together, boy we winnin'
You know you fuckin' with a bad bitch
And I'm fuckin' with a savage
But you know that I can handle it
But you know that I can handle it

[Chorus: Ann Marie]
(Nobody), nobody's gonna love you like me
(Nobody), nobody's gonna touch you like me
(Nobody), nobody's gonna do you like me
(Nobody), nobody
'Cause you know that I'm down to ride
I wanna be by your side
Ain't none of that wastin' your time
You know I'm not wastin' your time
These other niggas is lame
Tell them to stay out the way
You know you cannot be replaced
By nobody baby
By nobody baby
(Nobody)

[Verse 2: Ann Marie]
Baby, I haven't felt this way in a long time
Lately you're the only thing on my mind
And I know you feel the same 'cause I can see it in your face
It's like we take each other's pain away
The way you're lovin' me is magic
No nobody else can have it
Sexin' you is like a habit
You know I love when you grab it
You're everything that I imagined
You're everything that I imagined
Didn't expect for this to happen
But you know I like it

[Chorus: Ann Marie]
(Nobody), nobody's gonna love you like me
(Nobody), nobody's gonna touch you like me
(Nobody), nobody's gonna do you like me
(Nobody), nobody
'Cause you know that I'm down to ride
I wanna be by your side
Ain't none of that wastin' your time
You know I'm not wastin' your time
These other niggas is lame
Tell them to stay out the way
You know you cannot be replaced
By nobody

[Verse 3: Lil Durk]
I don't like nobody, I just want you
Five star chick, got me feelin' like Yo Gotti
Pull out my phone and start suckin' the soul out it
Fuck a key, on private jets, tell nobody
Nobody, nobody, not you, no nobody
Remember them days I used to have nobody
I can give her what she want, 'cause she hardbody
Super solid, keep her head lifted
Independent, she a breadwinner
Touch me wrong, you a dead nigga
Anything but scared nigga
Two rights don't make it wrong shawty, how you play it nigga
I'ma tell you how I feel shawty, I'ma come say it with you
(Nobody), they don't touch you like me
(Nobody), they can't kiss you like me
(Nobody), they can't do it like me
(Nobody), like who gon' take you from me?

[Chorus: Ann Marie]
'Cause you know that I'm down to ride
I wanna be by your side
Ain't none of that wastin' your time
You know I'm not wastin' your time
These other niggas is lame
Tell them to stay out the way
You know you cannot be replaced
By nobody baby

[Outro: Lil Durk & Ann Marie]
Nobody nobody nobody (nobody)
Nobody nobody nobody (nobody)
Nobody nobody nobody (nobody)
Who gon' take you (nobody)
