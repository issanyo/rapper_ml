[Intro]
Stuntman, woah, woah

[Hook: Antt Beatz]
Nigga I just bought a chopstick, no Benihanas
And I got that AR, so where the drummer
Got an old ass Tommy gun that got bodies on it
Come get me nigga, I don't worry, no I keep it coming

[Verse 1: Snap Dogg]
Niggas swear that they shooters, ain't shot shit
Ask about me, they gon' tell you that I drop shit
When Glock clips on hot shit, really hit your top bitch
I can put this chopper down drop quick
Y'all be beefing over pussy nigga?
I swear y'all some pussy niggas
On weak shit, beef shit
Y'all ain't with that street shit
I shot up your whole body, closed casket, y'all can't see shit
(Shit there goes Snap Dogg)
That's an opp nigga
That's my chop nigga
I'm really with the shit, do your homework
Coulda put my niggas on you but I do my own dirt

[Hook: Antt Beatz]
Nigga I just bought a chopstick, no Benihanas
And I got that AR, so where the drama
Got an old ass Tommy gun that got bodies on it
Come get me nigga, I don't worry, no I keep it coming

[Bridge: Snap Dogg]
I don't need no shooter, I'm my own shooter
I don't need no shooter, I'm my own shooter
I don't need no shooter, I'm my own shooter
It was them got the shooters, we ain't (?)

[Verse 2: Lil Durk]
Game is water, stand in them trenches with .45s raining
Show money go up to 50, them niggas can't be jaded
Red light, green light, catch you at red at night my city dangerous
Cause your life, you cool, but when you're dead niggas make you famous
Homicide been looking for me, riding around with my bitch
There go Durk, let's get him, (?) cops and (?)
Hit that Smith and tell these rappers diss 'em
Swish 'em, catch 'em, blick 'em
Instagram and Snapchat might be the calls of the victims
I don't need to shoot, I know my brothers got me
I got Rugers, Macs, .40s, 90s, wooden Dracos with the handle
Fuck a rumor nigga, ask me for the truth
And I'm talking (?) street, (?) I got the juice

[Hook: Antt Beatz]
Nigga I just bought a chopstick, no Benihanas
And I got that AR, so where the drama
Got an old ass Tommy gun that got bodies on it
Come get me nigga, I don't worry, no I keep it coming

[Bridge: Snap Dogg]
I don't need no shooter, I'm my own shooter
I don't need no shooter, I'm my own shooter
I don't need no shooter, I'm my own shooter
It was them got the shooters, we ain't (?)
