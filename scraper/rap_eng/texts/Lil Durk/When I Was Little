[Verse 1]
I'll fuck your bitch if she put it in
And I just ran up a hundred bands
Gave him my watch and he flooding it
Nut in her face and she rub it in
Niggas sippin' on the cutter ten
Bitch I'm ballin' like Above the Rim
See my face cost another ten
Had a Ford, now I got a Benz
Honda Accord, we was trappin' in
See the stores they was runnin' in
Snatch and grab, got my bitch a bag
Eleven years, got nine in
New generation dying fast
Before the P's, had dime bags
Pinky ring cost nine stacks, yeah
You can't name a bitch that I ain't touch
Now I'm Balmain rocking, came a long way from Von Dutch
Multiply and crush, shout out to scammers
Ain't no I in us, I'm too high to trust

[Chorus]
I was fucked up when I was little
I ain't never had no money (let's get it)
I was fucked up when I was little (was fucked up)
Now I got a whole lot of hundreds (drugs)
I didn't take drugs when I was little (turn up)
Percocet sick to my stomach (get it)
I got two beams, now you little (little)
You already know how I'm comin' (ayy)
I was fucked up when I was little (gang)
I ain't never had no money (guns)
I was fucked up when I was little (money)
Now I got a whole lot of hundreds (shooters)
I didn't take drugs when I was little
Percocet sick to my stomach
I got two beams, now you little (let's get it)
You already know how I'm comin' (let's get it)

[Verse 2]
Yeah, I can litter you (turn up)
Stay out them books, you political (let's get it)
I can litter you (litter you)
Bag on your head, get rid of you
You told on the audio
Nigga that's an interview
Got drugs in Idaho
Them'll come with chemicals
My skin inky, smoke that stinky
Don't drink that green shit, wedding ring my pinky
My bitch she decent, she know I eat it
She say I'm freaky, she know I'm geekin'
New Prada, two straps
Cough syrup, two caps
My bank account, 21, 21
That forty cal, 21, 21
I fuck her, she 21, 21
I got the pounds for, 21

[Chorus]
I was fucked up when I was little
I ain't never had no money (let's get it)
I was fucked up when I was little (was fucked up)
Now I got a whole lot of hundreds (drugs)
I didn't take drugs when I was little (turn up)
Percocet sick to my stomach (get it)
I got two beams, now you little (little)
You already know how I'm comin' (ayy)
I was fucked up when I was little (gang)
I ain't never had no money (guns)
I was fucked up when I was little (money)
Now I got a whole lot of hundreds (shooters)
I didn't take drugs when I was little
Percocet sick to my stomach
I got two beams, now you little (let's get it)
You already know how I'm comin' (let's get it)
