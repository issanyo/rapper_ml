[Intro]
I'm a hitta by myself
I'm a hitta by myself (L's)
"Hello?"
[Fredo Santana]
"Man whatup bro what's good?"
[Lil Durk]
"Chillin chillin man motherfucker back down in these streets man"
[Fredo Santana]
"Hell yeah boy you back down bro"
[Lil Durk]
Motherfuckers know what it is
Niggas got me goin' crazy
In the crib off the lazy

[Verse 1]
OTF we the team
And I'm a hitta that's the theme
Police snatch me I won't sing
Read me my rights and Imma leave
My people told me never trust none
Niggas be all in my face but I don't trust 'em


[Hook]
I got the black mask and I'm 'bout it
You know I can't leave the crib without it
A lot of people say they doubt me
You best believe my niggas 'bout it
Dreaded up and they 'bout it
Ridin' 'round and they 'bout it
All black and they 'bout it
OTF we 'bout it
Dreaded up and we 'bout it
Ridin' 'round and they 'bout it
All black and they 'bout it
OTF we 'bout it

[Verse 2]
I got O and Moski on my mind
I lean for [? 1:22] all the time
Free da guys like 300 times
[? 1:29] that's 300 time
Fuck the feds they gave my daddy life
For my son Imma make it right
The feds gave my daddy life
For my son Imma make it right
Ridin', 2 seaters
750 wit' two eaters
One nigga got two heaters
Ride on me and get blammed up
Soft niggas better man up
That limit squeeze don't jam up
Black mask, hand up
Move or get blammed up
Livin' up to that YOLO
Real niggas better stand up (Let's get it)
Cuff bitches no handcuffs (L's)
Niggas know that we'll band up (drillin')
Niggas better go get it (Let's get it)
Ridin' 'round and I'm gettin' it
'cept I got on three chains
I got a movie clip like DGainz (L's)

[Hook]
I got the black mask and I'm 'bout it
You know I can't leave the crib without it
A lot of people say they doubt me (bow bow bow)
You best believe my niggas 'bout it (Let's get it, L's)
Dreaded up and they 'bout it (300)
Ridin' 'round and they 'bout it (300)
All black and they 'bout it (let's get it)
OTF we 'bout it
Dreaded up and we 'bout it (let's get it)
Ridin' 'round and they 'bout it
All black and they 'bout it (Lil Durk)
OTF we 'bout it

[Verse 3]
It's one of them nights (let's get it)
I gotta carry that pipe
Look both ways like dykes
I can't get caught that's life
I'm so BOS nigga
That i gotta blam on sight
So if I see you wit' that light (L's)
Just know I blam you on sight (L's)
Hoes on my dick (let's get it)
Got me on my BJ shit
40' on this replay shit
Mac'll rip up three way shit (let's get it)
Easy to say drill is hard when you ain't drillin' shit
Sippin' for no feelin' shit
Fuck you and yo feelings bitch
I'm rollin' off a hitta
Too many say they drillin'
I go hard with no liquor
Gotta shoot me for a stick up
I do too much to bitch up (let's get it)
This 40' give you nip-tuck
You better keep yo lips tucked (L's)

[Hook]
I got the black mask and I'm 'bout it
You know I can't leave the crib without it (Let's get it)
A lot of people say they doubt me (bow bow bow)
You best believe my niggas 'bout it (300)
Dreaded up and they 'bout it (300)
Ridin' 'round and they 'bout it (300)
All black and they 'bout it (let's get it)
OTF we 'bout it  (let's get it)
Dreaded up and we 'bout it (Let's get it)

All black and they 'bout it (Lil Durk)
