[Hook]
The streets don't really love you like I love you
Money over bitches is what I learned too
Can't change on my niggas because they blood too
And if you thinkin' that we soft nigga fuck you
Pour up shots for them dead niggas
We gon' start something for them dead niggas
Tuck yo' tail if you scared, nigga
Where I'm from we take a chance nigga
Ohh, takin' chances
Where I'm from we just takin' chances
Ohh, we takin' chances
Where I'm from niggas takin' chances

[Verse 1]
Took some chances I was on the grind
Smokin' dope, toting poles, hangin' on the 9
DJ, ZDD, and Booda they people was always slime
The opps catch me lackin', pussy nigga stop cryin'
Lost Pluto and Vito, we mobbin' like Vito
For Nuski and Chino, got Glocks and kilos
Say I'm Hollywood, I ain't got a grammy bitch I love the hood
We kill, never mind bitch he in the woods
Shot niggas, never got shot though
My bitch charged but I got caught with a Glock though
The wrong place the wrong time got you tacos
You ain't shit in these streets without yo' nachos
No, no

[Hook]
The streets don't really love you like I love you
Money over bitches is what I learned too
Can't change on my niggas because they blood too
And if you thinkin' that we soft nigga fuck you
Pour up shots for them dead niggas
We gon' start something for them dead niggas
Tuck yo' tail if you scared, nigga
Where I'm from we take a chance nigga
Ohh, takin' chances
Where I'm from we just takin' chances
Ohh, we takin' chances
Where I'm from niggas takin' chances

[Verse 2]
How you loyal nigga, I can count on one hand who loyal nigga
If your gang, I can show you one nigga who loyal with you
Never gave me money never gave me shit
Never told me that you love me, always put my name in Hell
Never said free my name, put money up on my bail
Mixing birds, never gave me still, you ain't even give me a chance
I'm like damn I got bands, I'ma split it with my mans
I'ma buy the block guns, drugs and a couple vans
Gotta be real to 'em, you can even ask the fans
And how I been through it all, nigga fuck the feds
Like duckin' what, real shooter niggas tuckin' what
And we was broke and we ain't had nothing

[Hook]
The streets don't really love you like I love you
Money over bitches is what I learned too
Can't change on my niggas because they blood too
And if you thinkin' that we soft nigga fuck you
Pour up shots for them dead niggas
We gon' start something for them dead niggas
Tuck yo' tail if you scared, nigga
Where I'm from we take a chance nigga
Ohh, takin' chances
Where I'm from we just takin' chances
Ohh, we takin' chances
Where I'm from niggas takin' chances
