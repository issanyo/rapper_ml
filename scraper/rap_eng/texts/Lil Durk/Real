[Hook]
Pour a cup of that dirty
Might take me a perc 30
Gotta watch out for who love me and the same people who hurt me
Gotta watch out for who love me and the same people who hurt me
My momma said I might OD
I'ma a drinker ma I ain't worried
Gotta watch out in these streets
I'ma a thinker ma I ain’t worried
Can't trust none of these niggas
Don't love none of these bitches
How they judging me nigga
I came up from these trenches
I might roll a blunt up for my people
I might pour a cup up for my people

[Verse 1]
Baby momma actin' evil
Uncle still playin' wit them needles
New car gas diesel
New money cash Visa
Nuski died what they believin'
Brotha muslim to my pops too
Tell 'em pigs no pork needed
We ain't tryna talk no agreements
Beat my case wit the best lawyer
Told my sister I want the best for ya
Fuck a strippa go invest money
IG hoes that's a test for ya
Devil workin' want the best of ya
Street niggas make a mess of ya
Lil niggas put stress on ya
Yea yea yea
Start them killas off of guns, start the traphouse off of pounds
Bitch you know I love my son, boy my back was on the ground
Who love you when no one there, who love you when no one care

[Verse 2]
Close homie tried to kill me
I'm just givin' y'all that's the real me
Real niggas gotta feel me
Station tryna they tryna wheel me
Couple big niggas tried to lil me
I got more power so don't try me
I got missed call from my granny
Gotta get back wit the family
Streets say I need old me
Nappy dreads off the codeine
Block niggas servin' dope fiend
Gold rollies to a trophy
Fuck a deal I got street money
Keep money plug keep comin'
Comin' strong nothin' weak to me
Nick Cannon Glocks keep drummin'
In the streets wit me it ain't nowhere
Got all of these money I'mma show it
So who love you when no one there, who love you when no one care
