[Intro: L'A Capone]

Brothers . .  . I'm here with my brothers
Brothers!
Brothers!

[Transition: L'A Capone]

See now you can fuck my bitch, cause nigga I'm the shit, I'll salute ya'!
But y'all know who I'm wit', so try to take my shit, I'mma shoot ya'!

[Hook: L'A Capone]

And we all lost a couple this year, so all us right here with each other
I'm here with my brothers, in here with my brothers
I'm here with my brothers, in here with my brothers
I'm here with my brothers, in here with my brothers

[Verse 1: L'A Capone]

Only each other, only each other
Riding round town on that same shit, niggas get changed quick
You ain't seen shit
I hope you got a blunt of loud, you can't hit my shit
I guess I'm caught in the mix, riding the six
And hell yeah, I'm on paper still toting the nick
I promise I won't switch, you son of a bitch
At 16, had a dream, we was gonna' get rich, put on
We gone, wake up, put the pipe on
Always been on my own, but I stay strong
Act got me put in my zone, feeling like I wanna' go home
But I'm out here, I put that bud in my ear
I gotta' see a mil' one year
Squad they fear, Jakes all up in our hair
One of us snitch, that's rare
And that's on bro, I'll never ever go broke
Nigga I'll take yo' coat, while I froze
My lil' nigga Steve got smoked, throwing up Owe Six Owe
Gotta' lay low, niggas ain't really yo' bro, niggas ain't really yo' bro
Gotta' lay low, niggas ain't really yo' bro, niggas ain't really yo' bro

[Hook: L'A Capone]

And we all lost a couple this year, so all us right here with each other
I'm here with my brothers, in here with my brothers
I'm here with my brothers, in here with my brothers
I'm here with my brothers, in here with my brothers

[Verse 2: RondoNumbaNine]

Only my niggas, we all some hitters
I'm in that glory lane, just trynna' get richer
I'm in that glory lane, loud in my system
They took my bro L'A, man I can't even picture
They took a  fucking savage, man, bro was a killer, man
Bro was going crazy, now shit done got real
Fuck this rap shit, I say shit done got real, bro
Run up and we kill stuff, act up, we gon' let it bust
And let's get it!
All that fu shit I ain't wit' it, put the Glock to his muh' fucknig fitted
Nigga you wit' it, trynna' act like you ain't wit'!
Put the pipe to his mouth like a dentist
On Lil' Steve, bitch I'm throwing up D's, nigga that's where I be
Smoking on trees, a lotta' fucking money on me
Riding up and down Front Street and I keep that heat

[Verse 3: Lil' Durk]
Lost Lil' Moe, feeling so weak
Lost a couple niggas in these cold ass street
I lost my brother so I keep my heat
Make me turn up when I see the opps tweet
L'A my bro, Rob, Odee, Lil' Moe
All these hoes gon' go, when I claim my gang
Niggas never my chain, out here looking for a stain
Ask anybody I ain't change
Niggas switched up for that chain
L's or shells, they're in line
Tweak with the guys then you get flat lined
Take that nine, free my guys
My bro Nine on his grind
OTF, my niggas they shine
Top from a opp, she blow my mind
Keep my gun, shit real I say on my son
I'm trynna' get rich early in the morning, for the squad
Better put Kush in that blunt, put four in the crush, I stunt
I can't trust, any nigga [?] his gun, that mean he ain't real at all
I'mma ball, lil' nigga 'bout to do it tall
I just wanna' live it all!
I call my bro, do a drill for the squad, I go
Two gun cases, I'll blow, so let 'em all know
I'mma ride or die for my squad!
I'mma ride and die for my squad!

[Hook: L'A Capone]

I'm here with my brothers, right here with my brothers
I'm here with my brothers, right here with my brothers
I'm here with my brothers, right here with my brothers
I'm here with my brothers, right here with my brothers
