[Intro: Yung Fume]
It's ’cause I know you're going through it
Forrest Beats
I'm holdin’ all my feelings in

[Chorus: Yung Fume & Lil Durk]
When you told me I don't know why but I didn't believe it
It's 'cause I know you're going through it, tell me all your secrets
Niggas ask you for your last even though they never did it
They ain't bring them profits back I said they're forever greedy
I’m on the phone, I’m making moves, I'm tryna double two
’Cause I'm a human being just like you
I was in the trap, you can relate if you was in there too
Durk keep a strap, niggas acting like they bulletproof

[Verse 1: Lil Durk]
I'mma go and chase the bag, I'mma get it by any means
I told that bitch I’m not her lover, I'm not like Billie Jean
I'mma beat my case or get a dub 'cause I'm not copping pleas
Two Glocks ain't talking 'bout no Gucci I love them double G's
They said I could not come around unless my temper leave
I told my brothers I love 'em to death I'mma buy a lot of P
You tryna trap and go to war that shit like centipede
Fighting my bitch then fighting my case, ain't got the energy
I got rejected from a visit on my felony
And I get 30 for a show just off my melodies
I cut off Percs, I don't do Xans and I like Ecstacy
These niggas acting like they gay they tryna get next to me
You can't say I don't deserve it, you not a part of my struggle
The nigga kill you say he love you that's just part of the jungle
Who'd have thought Lil Varney get shot and lose half his muscle
I can't show you where I lay my head 'cause I can't trust you

[Chorus: Yung Fume & Lil Durk]
When you told me I don't know why but I didn't believe it
It's 'cause I know you're going through it, tell me all your secrets
Niggas ask you for your last even though they never did it
They ain't bring them profits back I said they're forever greedy
I'm on the phone, I'm making moves, I'm tryna double two
'Cause I'm a human being just like you
I was in the trap, you can relate if you was in there too
Durk keep a strap, niggas acting like they bulletproof

[Verse 2: Yung Fume]
All over the map do shows that's back to back, that's two on two
That's some shit I thought that I would never do
Pray I go to heaven too
Never switch up on your closest bredrins for some better moves
I don't wanna hear 'bout niggas hating, gimme better news
You link me with a new plug now I'm getting better packs
It's just me and God in this ting I said I'll never lack
I don't fuck her more than once 'cause she will get attached
I'm stacking racoons every month, might cop a two bedroom flat
Cah them fake people like my love, keep that fake love way back
I'm only speaking facts, packs, doubled up my racks yeah
I came from the trap, yeah, I came from the trap
When I told you I don't know why but I didn't believe that

[Chorus: Yung Fume & Lil Durk]
When you told me I don't know why but I didn't believe it
It's 'cause I know you're going through it, tell me all your secrets
Niggas ask you for your last even though they never did it
They ain't bring them profits back I said they're forever greedy
I'm on the phone, I'm making moves, I'm tryna double two
'Cause I'm a human being just like you
I was in the trap, you can relate if you was in there too
Durk keep a strap, niggas acting like they bulletproof

[Verse 3: Yung Fume]
[?]
You told me I didn't believe it
What the fuck do you mean?
Money coming so clean
Baby girl tell my your secrets
I've been doing shows all week, I've been doing shows all week
You told me I didn't believe it
I've been on the roads all week, I've been on the roads all week
Baby

[Chorus: Yung Fume & Lil Durk]
When you told me I don't know why but I didn't believe it
It's 'cause I know you're going through it, tell me all your secrets
Niggas ask you for your last even though they never did it
They ain't bring them profits back I said they're forever greedy
I'm on the phone, I'm making moves, I'm tryna double two
'Cause I'm a human being just like you
I was in the trap, you can relate if you was in there too
Durk keep a strap, niggas acting like they bulletproof
