[Intro: Lil Durk & 21 Savage]
I'mma say it 2 times with this money, money, on me, on me Gang!
We ain't playin' with this niggas man

[Hook: Lil Durk]
I just say it 2 times with this money, money and it's on me, on me
Why you tweakin' ain't my homie, homie (Gang!)
Get this cash, cash, I just want it fast, fast
I'mma spaz, spaz
Get on yo' ass, ass (Gang! Gang!)
No need for vest, vest
Aim, aim, head, head, chest, chest, yes, yes (Dope)
Shooters, shooters with me, with me
Why you playin' 50s, 50s, 50s, 50s, 50s, 50s (Gang!)

[Verse 1: 21 Savage]
Get the shots nigga, woah (21)
That stick gon' sweep a nigga up, you better not hit the floor
SWAT team, Mossberg, comin' through the door (21)
Tommy gun woah

Lil' bitch I know you heard how Young Savage scrape the bowl (skrt)
Motorola beepin' (21)
VVSs fleekin' (fleek)
Lil Durk he got the 30 on him, he might get to tweakin' (21)
I just pulled up on yo' main bitch and you know she freaky (I did)
She know I ain't no sleeper (ya dig)
Time to call a uber (21)
Young Savage man I bought a Draco for my shooter (21, 21)
MAC 11 smoke yo' baby daddy like some hookah (ya dig)
We got Glocks, Ks, TECs, nigga and bazookas (straight up)
Clip long like a ruler (straight up!)

[Verse 2: Lil Durk]
Me I just came out of poverty
I just spent 50 on property
I'm from the streets to the gun violence
Glocks annihilate you probably
I pour up a four for my dead guys
My hood is more than a block to me
I keep a jock on me, a couple killas ain't no opps with me
Bitches want sex I want all mouth
We be them niggas they talkin' 'bout
I'm saucin' I'm walkin', I'm Wayne now
Don't treat I'm coolin' with gang now
Overdose I'm like Wayne now
Before we was strapped like Girbaud jeans
Now we spend 50 on chains now
And we put 50 on things now
Booty died from dialysis
Opp niggas was the happiest
The city know we be wacking shit
Real killa, ain't know accident
Crackin' calls with the MACs and shit
Got the pounds and I'm matchin' shit
Guns and dope in the mattress shit
Fuck nigga with the actin' shit
Gang!
