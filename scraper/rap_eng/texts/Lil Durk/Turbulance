Feniko
Josue

[Pre-Chorus: Lil Durk]
I just put the whole hood on my back
I just turned up and I got me a sack
The streets is real (for real, for real)
I cannot lie, I gotta spit facts
I hit the road, I gotta get back
Can't call like that, my phone is tapping

[Chorus: Lil Durk]
Only The Family involved (only the family, yeah-yeah)
Only The Family involved (only the family, yeah-yeah)
Only The Family involved (only the family, yeah-yeah)
Only The Family involved (only the family)

[Verse 1: Lil Durk]
You claim you family, nigga, you just a fan to us
You so monopoly, nigga, you just a scam to us
I love my vultures forever, you is not kin to us
Only The Family in my eyes, you can't get to us
Only The Family involved
Tell 'em, "We gotta evolve!"
I am not fuckin' you raw
Tee bag a bitch, she lickin' my balls

[Verse 2: OTF Ikey]
Bitch, cut off the dope and it's raw (bitch)
Bitch, in the trap, I'm a boss
Federales hit the spot
Fettuccine in the pot
Suckin' dick to get ya name up
No money, heard you bankrupt
Bitches know we famous
Two, three chains clangin'

[Verse 3: Booka600]
We done started waves
And niggas can't obtain it
From the block, the basics
Feelin' like we made it
Make a disable feel enable
Street niggas sittin' at that table
Young savages, a couple a-hole
That's what they label us

[Verse 4: Lil Durk]
My bitch strictly dickly, yeah, she new
Gotta go get it, yeah, a big bankroll
Niggas be trippin', yeah, a snitch, they fold
Bitches be trippin', yeah, they heart be cold
So high like a Martian
My bitch a Barbie
My bitch, she bartend
You shop at Carson
Hit the road in a RV
You high off morphine
Trap house, more fiend
Heard you snort clean

[Verse 5: OTF Ikey & Booka600]
These bitches playin' with their nose
I don't play with my nose
Me and Ikey got these bitches rollin'
Promise never sell our soul

[Pre-Chorus: Lil Durk]
I just put the whole hood on my back
I just turned up and I got me a sack
The streets is real (for real, for real)
I cannot lie, I gotta spit facts
I hit the road, I gotta get back
Can't call like that, my phone is tapping

[Chorus: Lil Durk]
Only The Family involved (only the family, yeah-yeah)
Only The Family involved (only the family, yeah-yeah)
Only The Family involved (only the family, yeah-yeah)
Only The Family involved (only the family)
