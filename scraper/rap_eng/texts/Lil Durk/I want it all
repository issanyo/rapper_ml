[Verse 1: King L]
I just want it all, I just wanna ball
I might take 10k out the bank and spend it all
I like my money fast, don't like for bands to stall
Run up I pop off, don't got no time to brawl
All I do is spend, all I do is win
Tell me drop the top, cause she love the wind
?, I'm balling like im Lin
With the choppa in the benz
Steady counting bands, shopping with my dead friends
I'm staring through the lenses, just to check my vision
I do what I want, I dont need no permission
Gangstas what they isn't, I just might get em missin
My bitches with the shit ? they kissing
We be smoking dope and we be sipping, hiding in the foreign
Let me close my curtains, they loving the crew
King Louie lil durk now OTF MUBU gang ?

I just wanna ball
I know I be stuntin, I just want it all
Go get you some money, I just want it all

[Verse 2]
Bands on top of bands, paper cuts on hands
From all of these new bands
300 on them pants, just to show my ass, those are for them hittas
Tell em free the drillas, all my niggas hustlers
Some of them is killers, some of them is crackers
Some of them drug dealers, trying to get it all till they lock or till they kill us
Go hard for the city, show them what the deal is
All about my bags, 30 in my mag
Doing good, smoking good, do a bitch bad
Homicide swag, popping bottles, popping tags
I know these haters mad, niggas broke and that's sad
Sonning all these niggas, im the number one dad
My knucks show me bad speeding in the black jag
Always in the air, what they know bout jet lag
Everyday I mubu, tell them niggas start a stack
Racks on racks on racks

[Hook]
I just wanna ball
I know I be stuntin, I just want it all
Go get you some money, I just want it all
And I'mma tell em yeah
And go get you some money
Yeah yeah
And I just want it all
