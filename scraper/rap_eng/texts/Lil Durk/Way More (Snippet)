[Lyrics from Snippet]

They don't want to see us come alive
How the niggas who went hollywood steady rappin' about the trenches?
Cut niggas off, they was all in their feelings
I told him cut his bitch off seen her ridin' with them niggas
And I find that shit crazy they hate who be against me
Yeah I'm so ten toes I'm who they fuckin' with
You niggas talkin' bad about me tell 'em suck a dick
I told my brothers that we blood I don't know who my cousins is
And if you is you hang with them you know what is it
I swear I'd go back to jail for all my brother's kids
I swear I'd go back to jail to see my brothers live
Shoot shoot then file the ambulance make sure you dead for real
Yo' parents rich you sip with spoons my family ain't left a will
And we ain't doin' no sneaky talk they ass had left for real
And why he talkin' out his chest like he a (?) still
Them niggas ain't worried about no shooters they was made to kill
I put my heart inside my music I got pain for real
Justin lost his grandma I got pain for him
Made me call my grandma way more
And since she changed my life I gotta change yours
