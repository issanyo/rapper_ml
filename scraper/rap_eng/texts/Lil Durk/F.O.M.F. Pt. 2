[Intro]
Riding with me
If you ain't riding with me
If you ain't riding with me
If you ain't
If you ain't
If you ain't

[Bridge: Lil Durk]
If you ain't riding with me get the fuck up out my face
Hoe if you ain't riding with me get the fuck up out my face
I say if you ain't riding with me get the fuck up out my face
Boy if you ain't riding with me get the fuck up out my face

[Verse 1: Curtis Williams]
I can't trust myself so I can't trust a nigga
Most these girls be phony I can't love these bitches
Made my money on my own instead of taking loans
Pouring shots at all my shows niggas smoking strong
The circle tight, but the clique thick
Had my mind made up that we was getting rich
Get the fuck up out my face nigga give me space
Ain't familiar with no handouts had to make a lane
The more you earn the tables turn
Watched the homies fade, and all the bridges burn
But I'mma keep it trill and keep a blunt rolled
This for my real niggas had to let them know

[Hook: Lil Durk]
Let em know (Let's get it)
Let em know (L's)
Let em know (Let's get it)
I had to let em know
I had to let em know (L's)
Let em know (L's)
Throw your L's up I had to let em know
Let em know

[Bridge: Lil Durk]
If you ain't riding with me get the fuck up out my face
Hoe if you ain't riding with me get the fuck up out my face
I say if you ain't riding with me get the fuck up out my face
Boy if you ain't riding with me get the fuck up out my face

[Verse 2: Pavy]
If you ain't riding with me get the fuck up out my face
If you ain't invested keep suggestions in they place
Position like defining whats distant far away
Cause I'm persistent keep a eye on the mission see I display
That I'm all about progression for that back tracking I can't go
That's the reason my new bitch shitting all on my old ho
That's the reason my new raps shitting all on my old flow and
That's the reason my web hits shitting all on yo promo
Since I dropped that heroin they all want a verse
Killed them on they own shit swear they all got a hearse
I enthrall, they adverse, they appall disperse
What you call, what befalls from ya work on the first
Nigga that's payment for them days when I rapping off in that basement
Fearful for my placement, giving my sole but still on that pavement
Now I be destined for greatness, indentured to it like enslavement
So if u ain't rolling and doubt what im molding then please get the fuck outta my face bitch

[Hook: Lil Durk]
Let em know (Let's get it)
Let em know (L's)
Let em know (Let's get it)
I had to let em know
I had to let em know (L's)
Let em know (L's)
Throw your L's up I had to let em know
Let em know

[Bridge: Lil Durk]
If you ain't riding with me get the fuck up out my face
Hoe if you ain't riding with me get the fuck up out my face
I say if you ain't riding with me get the fuck up out my face
Boy if you ain't riding with me get the fuck up out my face

[Verse 3 :Key!]
Word on the street, I ain't worth nothing
Lennox square mall throwing money like Onyx
Word on the street you spend your dollars on a ho
She do what I say and I make dollars off the ho
Money on my line I can't click over for a bitch
My nigga balling hard every quarter shooting bricks
I ain't even signed hitting corners in the 6
I was making pays niggas sitting picks
Counting hundreds while I'm getting faced
I'm making money while I'm getting faded
I just feel I had to let them know
If your money don't fold you gotta let them know

[Hook: Lil Durk]
Let em know (Let's get it)
Let em know (L's)
Let em know (Let's get it)
I had to let em know
I had to let em know (L's)
Let em know (L's)
Throw your L's up I had to let em know
Let em know

[Bridge: Lil Durk] (2x)
If you ain't riding with me get the fuck up out my face
Hoe if you ain't riding with me get the fuck up out my face
I say if you ain't riding with me get the fuck up out my face
Boy if you ain't riding with me get the fuck up out my face
