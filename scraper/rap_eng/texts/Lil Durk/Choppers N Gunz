[Intro: Young Thug]
Choppers and guns
Don't play with us nigga
We killin' for fun
I promise to God
I promise to Pablo
You know I'm a nino
My tolerance zero

[Verse 1: Boosie]
Nigga snatched from your house
Clutch you on the couch
Nigga you don't know my people
Went to war with like 14 people
Drink Codeine like it's legal
Manny Fresh in the cut all turned up
Used to tell my homeboy slow down
Laughed at me clutchin' on the four pound
Nigga bumped his head 'fore I came home
Me and Five Gang in the Regal
Goin' to get back at the busters
I told Fat fall back with the jack heads
'Fore I came home, nigga dusted
Now they do it on them buses
Come and get you like buster
All my side women know
Do I still roll with Buster?
I don't lay down, play around with no nigga
Track life boss made, I'm a go getter
Still real, still solid, no ho nigga
You ain't just heard what happened to them ho niggas?
Everybody gettin' shot, niggas gettin' stopped
Mommas really outchea losin' they sons
Might as well keep it real with them young niggas
Might as well tell 'em get guns

[Hook: Boosie]
Choppers and guns, choppers and guns
Chop-chop-chop-choppers and guns
Choppers and guns, choppers and guns
Choppers and guns, choppers and guns
Oh shit man, here we go with them choppers and guns
Choppers and guns, choppers and guns
Hope you got choppers and guns

[Verse 2: Lil Durk]
I can hear my brother racin' whip too
Double homicide on 'em, shit we're takin' two
But this ain't what you want with my breakthrough
Lil nigga but my heart like I make two
You become an opp, you got chased too
Crackin' on the BOAs and the change too
And you tell me Tina murder ain't make the news
If the devil kill me then I'm killin' you
Hood time we dark like my momma's stress
Keep it on me, macaroni's how I aim next
And choppers on choppers, rather page Dex
And I only want top, I don't need sex
And when I seen a brick it was summer of 06
I flooded out the Rollie now I look like the ocean
Police hurry up and I told 'em I don't know shit
I talk a lot of shit like I got Halitosis
Niggas be mad, what they be mad at?
Bitches be broke, with they sad ass
I'ma get fast cash
Burkin' Badass
My bitch is the baddest, my diamonds the clearest (water)
You talkin' bout robbin' me? Is you serious?
Oh yeah-yeah

[Hook: Boosie]
Choppers and guns, choppers and guns
Chop-chop-chop-choppers and guns
Choppers and guns, choppers and guns
Choppers and guns, choppers and guns
Oh shit man, here we go with them choppers and guns
Choppers and guns, choppers and guns
Hope you got choppers and guns

[Verse 3: Young Thug]
AKs and Tecs on niggas
They aim at your neck for figures
These hoes know you fake, they know it
You camp and you flex on niggas
I shoot at 'em full speed
We shoot from the neck to knees
Draw down with that Tec and bleed
I'm rockin' v-neck with V's (VVS's)
I pull up with a bitch and let her riff it real rapid
We live by the codes of the streets, respect your daddy
Gave a half a mil to the jeweler, now I'm cold like attics
You can't have it (blat-blat-blat)
Fuck around, get whacked
Thuggin', nigga what?
Send him to the other room
Yeah, next to the moon
When I'm geeked up, bottle shrooms
Smoke his ass like some fumes
Where the

[Hook: Boosie]
Choppers and guns, choppers and guns
Chop-chop-chop-choppers and guns
Choppers and guns, choppers and guns
Choppers and guns, choppers and guns
Oh shit man, here we go with them choppers and guns
Choppers and guns, choppers and guns
Hope you got choppers and guns

[Verse 4: Boosie]
Niggas gettin' smoked at the Exxon
'Fore I leave the house, grab the teflon
I look at my nigga, you outta here
Don't make me say where you was (?) here
Nigga lookin' for you, they don't ride round
Fuck a four boy, I got a five pound
Chief Keef with the sweep, shit get deeper
Track like Chi-Town
Nine shots, ten shots, we can get down
You can stand up bitch but you gon' sit down
You can man up bitch and you get miss 'round
But we and-1 niggas and commit fouls
Niggas out the road cause these niggas rat
Shoulda got him when you seen his name up in black
Yeah I'm real, gun one down for a (?)
Juice wasn't even no act

[Hook: Boosie]
Choppers and guns, choppers and guns
Chop-chop-chop-choppers and guns
Choppers and guns, choppers and guns
Choppers and guns, choppers and guns
Oh shit man, here we go with them choppers and guns
Choppers and guns, choppers and guns
Hope you got choppers and guns

[Verse 5: Boosie]
My nigga lil Turn in the papers
Heard he own a body in the cape
He looked at me like I'm a G though
This was when he was in three door
To-Lu, he come for his kilos
But he got a bag of them squirters
A bag of money and a big ass heart
It's about to be capital murder
They swing and they whack you on purpose
They walk by your house like they turtles
You see 'em, you run, you jump hurdles
You left it at home now you murdered
How the fuck I'm supposed to tell lil daddy chill out when the nigga 'round tryna kill him
They killed his lil cousin and Slim
These boys play above the rim

[Hook: Boosie]
Choppers and guns, choppers and guns
Chop-chop-chop-choppers and guns
Choppers and guns, choppers and guns
Choppers and guns, choppers and guns
Oh shit man, here we go with them choppers and guns
Choppers and guns, choppers and guns
Hope you got choppers and guns
