See now you can fuck my bitch, cause nigga i'm the shit

So try to take my shit ima shoot ya
And we all lost a couple this year, so all us here with eachother
I'm here with my brothers, in here with my brothers
I'm here with my brothers, in here with my brothers
I'm here with my brothers, in here with my brothers

[Verse 1: L'A Capone]
Only each other, only each other
Riding round town on that same shit, niggas get changed quick
You ain't seen shit
I hope you got a blunt of loud, you can't hit my shit
I guess im caught in the mix, riding the six
Hell yea im on paper still totting the nick
I promise I won’t switch, You son of a bitch
At 16 had a dream, we was gonna get rich
We gone wake up, put the pipe on
Always been on my own, But I stay strong
Act got me put in my zone, Feeling like I wanna go home
But I’m out here
I put that bud in my ear, I gotta see a mil one year
Squad they fear, Jakes all up in our hair
One of us snitch, that's rare
And that's on bro, I'll ever never go broke
Nigga i'll take your coat, while i froze
My little nigga steve got smoked, throwing up 060
Gotta lay low, niggas ain't really your bro
Niggas ain't really your bro
Gotta lay low, niggas ain't really your bro
Niggas ain't really your bro

[Hook]
And we all lost a couple this year, so all us here with eachother
I'm here with my brothers, in here with my brothers
I'm here with my brothers, in here with my brothers
I'm here with my brothers, in here with my brothers

[Verse 2: Rondonumbaine]
Only my niggas, we all some hitters
Im in that glory lane, just trying to get richer
Im in that glory lane , loud in my system
They took my bro L'A, Man I can't even picture
They took a fucking savage man, bro was a killer man
Bro was going crazy, now shit done got real
Fuck this rap shit, I say shit that got real bro
Run up and we kill stuff, act up we gon' let it bust
And lets get it, all the fu shit I ain't with it
Put the Glock to his motherfucking fitted
Nigga you with it, try to act like you ain't with it
Put the pipe to his mouth like a dentist, on lil steve
Bitch im throwing up B's, Nigga that's where I be
I'm smoking on tree, Alot of fucking money on me
Riding up and down Front Street

[Hook]
See now you can fuck my bitch, cause nigga i'm the shit
I'll salute ya, but yall know who i'm with
So try to take my shit ima shoot ya
And we all lost a couple this year, so all us here with eachother
I'm here with my brothers, right here with my brothers
I'm here with my brothers, right here with my brothers
I'm here with my brothers, right here with my brothers

[Verse 3: Lil Durk]
Lost Pluto, feel so weak
Lost a couple niggas in these cold ass streets
I lost my brother, so I keep my heat
Made me turn up when I see the opps tweet
L’A my bro, Rob, Odee, Lil Moe, All these hoes gone go when I claim my gang
Niggas never snatched my chain, out here looking for a stain
Ain't no lame, ask anybody I ain't changed
Niggas switch up for that chain, L's this year there in line
Tweak with the guys, then you getting flat lined
Take that nine free my guys, my lil bro Nine on his grind
OTF my niggas they shine, top from a opp she blow my mind
Keep my gun, shit real, say it on my son
I'm trying to get rich in a month, for the squad
Better put kush in that blunt, pour a four in that crush, i stunt
I can't trust any nigga loud around his gun, that mean he ain't real at all
Im a ball, lil nigga bout to do it tall, I just wanna live it all
I call my bro, do a drill for the squad I go
Two gun cases I blow so let them all know
I'm a ride or die for my squad, I'm a ride or die for my squad

[Hook]
I'm here with my brothers, right here with my brothers
I'm here with my brothers, right here with my brothers
I'm here with my brothers, right here with my brothers
I'm here with my brothers, right here with my brothers
