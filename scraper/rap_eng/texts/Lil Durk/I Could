[Intro]
Damn to this day nigga still pray on my down fall
You can't deny good music or a real nigga
For real for real

[Hook:]
I used to break in the crib now I got a safe in the crib
Chiraq crime rate build so it ain't safe at the crib
I just want money forever told em that’s how Imma live
Shootings and murders I seen I ain't never say I did it
As a kid growing up
As a kid growing up
As a kid growing up
I done seen a lot of shit
As a kid growing up
As a kid growing up
As a kid growing up
I done did a lot of shit

[Verse 1:]
I done seen how you shoot niggas
Now I see right through people
Three years of my life to them people
Judge labeled me a menace
I might grind to them people
I gotta ride around with my heater
Police killing my people
Overseas cause I'm legal
I ain't taking no chances
Masks on for them cameras
On my own no advances
Broken homes for advances
As a kid growing up
I used to be poured up
I ain't never froze up
All I know is drill drill
Put him on a poster
Reward money for the killer
They ain't never found the killer
Don't nobody know nothing
I rob niggas for they tool
Brought guns up in school
Started a war got to move
Free nine boy let em loose (Ls)

[Hook:]

As a kid growing up
As a kid growing up
As a kid growing up
I done seen a lot of shit
As a kid growing up
As a kid growing up
As a kid growing up
I done did a lot of shit

[Verse 2:]
Put a nigga on the news
I'm in traffic with the tool
Three cases Imma fool
Gave my life to a[?]
In the hand of a [?]
Shooters took him on a cruise
Streets see how I roll
Still trying to get Zoo
Still chasing them millions
Daddy gave me the wisdom
Twenty-three years up in prison
I swear I seen his vision
Seen my son I start tearin'
I took the game it wasn't given
Ditched school hit the hood
Streets love me I'm good
Shed tears if I could
Shed blood if I could
Shared money if I could
Shared guns if I could
Sell coke if I could
Sell dope if I could
I'd rob if I could
I'm getting money cause I could (Ls)

I used to break in the crib now I got a safe in the crib
Chiraq crime rate build so it ain't safe at the crib
I just want money forever told em that’s how Imma live
Shootings and murders I seen I ain't never say I did it
As a kid growing up
As a kid growing up
As a kid growing up
I done seen a lot of shit
As a kid growing up
As a kid growing up
As a kid growing up
I done did a lot of shit
