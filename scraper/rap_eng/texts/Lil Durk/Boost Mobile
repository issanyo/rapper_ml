[Intro: Trav]
Ayy yo
Ayy yo y'all niggas meet me by the motherfuckin'
The spot in like twenty minutes
Trap house doin' numbers, hey

[Chorus: Trav]
Trap phone clickin', Boost Mobile
Two pots on stove
Trap house still local
Gettin' money, now I'm global
Pussy nigga I don't know you
Get money, I'll show you
Got the brick on the stove
Trap house doin' numbers
Trap phone Boost Mobile
Two pots on stove
Trap house real local
Gettin' money, now I'm global
Pussy nigga I don't know you
Get money, I'll show you
Got the brick on the stove
Trap house doin' numbers
Trap phone Boost Mobile

[Verse 1: Trav]
Listen nigga, I don't party
'Less my gun inside the party
Bless down to catch a body
Then bless us with a body
Free Rucker, free Bardi (B)
'Bout my fetty like I'm Monty
Ain't no rooster in my Rari, oh
I got some brims in my Maybach (MBF)
Inside had world better, say that (hats off)
I'm 'bout my double M like Maybach (huh)
UPS send a brick through, I'm like take that
I'm feelin' like I'm Diddy, runnin' through my city
Holdin' on the tooly, sixty shots in it, ayy
Beagle, I'ma spin it, get the money then I spend it
I be runnin' through the paper, prayin' for my haters

[Chorus: Trav]

[Verse 2: Lil Durk]
Hit my Boost Mobile trap phone
Feds tryna see what Durk on
Who the fuck is you? Mike Jones
Four-five Glock break bones
Can't see broke niggas, Ray Charles
I'm in to trappin' out the bando
Can't run off on the man though
Why you playin' ho, I'm the man though
Mixtapes on demand though
Bricks on me in high power
In the club, I'm so paraniod
It got me feelin' just like Ty Dolla
Rondo gone six digits
All black, I'm with six niggas
Draco in like six minutes
I could rob a nigga in six blizzards
OTF bitch, on my dead homies
Rappin' niggas put the feds on me
Run up on 'em, put the lead on 'em
Bitch niggas, ain't scared homie
Chiraq, I don't really know y'all
Smoke a nigga like a Newport
G5 with a clip on it
Huh, yeah yeah

[Chorus: Trav]
