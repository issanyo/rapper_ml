[Intro:]
Hate being wasted
Let's get it

[Hook:]
The drug man don't deliver
I'm in this bitch so sober
My bitch get off at 9
At 6 she took my Rover
I can't think straight
I need drugz in my life
I can't think straight
I need drugz in my life
How the stoners keep that dope smoke
Promethazine so slow
I can't be sober no mo
Hate being sober
I rather be wasted
Hate being sober
I rather be wasted
I can't think straight
I need drugz in my life
I can't think straight
I need drugz in my life
I can't think straight
I need drugz in my life
I can't think straight
I need drugz in my life

[First verse:]
I can't think straight I need drugs bad
I ain't tryna show no love bae
Got 4 in my cup and I don't give a fuck
Tell your bitch to turn up and bring more drugs
Lil bitch and she roll with gang
Pop a pill now she roll with me
Big bankroll in my jeans
So you know ain't no cuffin me
But you know how it go though
Bring a backwood down and I'll roll though
Got a white bitch with me named Coco
She in love with the D in her coco
All my niggas they flexin finessin
Off of them drugs but you know they be reckless
When we pull up we be aimin at chests
All my niggas they aimin at reckless know that they reckless

[Hook:]

[Second verse:]
You need the lean killin' [?]
Last night I was so drunk
I was up in stars dreaming purple mixed in as the potion
Keep me sleepy [?] ro-s√©
Sippin addict pimpin THC I'm stonin dippin
And its 8 in the morning, Im still goin hard though
And I'm hard in Chicago, the mix make the time slow
I promise just taste it, that Red Bull to chase it
Let's make a toast, let's make a toast cause we made it

[Hook:]
