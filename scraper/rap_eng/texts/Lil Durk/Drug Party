[Intro]
Chopsquad DJ on the beat so it's a banger
Let's get it, L

[Chorus]
We can take Xan baby in my party
We can drink the lean baby in my party (aye)
We can pour the liquor baby with some molly
Up all night we can do it till the morning
Welcome to my drug party, my drug party baby
Welcome to my drug party, my drug party baby
Welcome to my drug party, my drug party baby
Welcome to my drug party, my drug party

[Verse 1]
