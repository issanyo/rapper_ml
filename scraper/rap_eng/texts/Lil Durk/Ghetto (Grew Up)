[Intro]
Ghetto, yeah I grew up in the ghetto
Let's get it
L's

[Hook: Lil Durk]
(I grew up like that)
Nothing to eat, nowhere to sleep, nowhere to go
People to meet, I'm from these streets
(I grew up like that)
Steady going to funerals, steady going to interviews
Not going too far, so I stick to the wall
(I grew up like that) I grew up in the ghetto
Where niggas don't make it out like that
(I grew up like that) I grew up in the ghetto
Where my niggas don't make it out like that

[Verse 1: Lil Durk]
I grew up with fam, I grew up with niggas that call me fam
I grew up with niggas who state they man
I grew up with niggas who got in that jam
I grew up with niggas doing life in the can
War time, fighting for land
But I grew up in the ghetto
Times I ain't eat nun, go to school just to eat lunchh
No kid watching re-runs, wake up doing re-runs
My momma, my opponent (let's get it)
These millions I'm on it
And I gotta eat nigga
On the corners everyday with the lights out
Walk in broad day with the pipes out
Waking up middle night with the lights out
So why these niggas faking?
I pray to God that I make it
I told my momma I can't take it (the ghetto)

[Hook: Lil Durk]

[Verse 2: Hypno Carlito]
C-C-Came up in the ghetto
People tell me keep my head up my whole life
If I didn't have nothing, I'm fed up
B-B-Bitches out here, just shut up
Rest in peace my lil shawty
I promise I wish I could write you a letter
And I miss you momma
I cherish this life, because no one is promised tomorrow
Pray to my father
Lord forgive me for sins I committed
But this is the way that we living
Why can't no one see my vision?
Remember the basement
Remember my aunty would beat me because of the dishes
Couldn't wait to get grown
Say to myself when I make it I'm gone from you bitches

[Bridge]
Even though a nigga tryna make it out I still got love for the (ghetto x3)
I can't change, I was raised in the (ghetto x3)
Made me who I am and I love the (ghetto x3)

[Hook: Lil Durk]

[Outro]
(I grew up in the ghetto)
Why they faking, why they faking?
