[Intro]
Yeah, lets get it, I ain't fuckin' around
Fuck these niggas, Niggas know how we ridin'
Gang, OTF FTO!

[Verse 1: Lil Durk]
Wuk say he holdin' weight, call up Twin he hate to wait
Bake 'em with the Eight, Ike wanna bake his face
Shooter ain't no shooters, if they count they straight, whatâ€™s yo count?
Sayin' BDK then watch yo' mouth
Thirty shots go out [Rrraaa Rrraaa!]
Why you hate on me? I taught you niggas how to bag a treat
Turn up on these opps then bags some D, niggas woof at me
Spreadin' these rumors talkin' 'bout, pussy I don't respond to goofies
Police lookin', pulls a slicky, Murder scenes yo' block like movies
Ain't no robbers in Chicago I never seen some boys tote Uzis
Keep my gun, on my son, my niggas they one of one
Nigga ain't no one on one, see them swing, I clutch that drum
No one ain't no friend no more, these niggas hoes, these niggas done
Niggas in my face be like
"How you sign yo' deal and shit? Heard you left yo' block
When you made that million quick"
I ain't make a million, shit, you woulda seen a million bricks
J-money was torchin' opps, ahh I hate the streets that took Lil Rob
I just copped a brick of hard, These niggas soft, pussy fraud
Askin' why they took Sheroid
Gave an inch they took a yard, Ruler on my hip
Beuller in this bitch
'Cept our guns playin' all the music in this bitch
Opps be on that Twitter war
Stop, you ain't no hitta boy, stop, you ain't no killa boy
All that shit a gimmick boy, All the opps, they trippin' boy
Got the news trendin' boy
Chiraq, Drillinois, go tell 'em, Killinois
Autotune my raps now, every show, we strapped now
They crazy, actin' like you bustin'
You get clapped down, Bro dem got that mac now
When we hear that Mac sound, boomerang van we do a hit
And we come back 'round, all that talk and talkin' shit
Men with that tucked Tony
Two bangin cases on my momma, imma keep it on me
Gotta watch my back for these snakes, cause the streets hold 'em
Imma leave 'em in the back, by his self, then a nigga lonely

[Outro]
Fuck with my niggas man
Imma go bar I don't need a hook
I started this bar shit, feel me?
Squad, squad
