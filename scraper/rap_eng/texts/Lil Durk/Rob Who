[Chorus: La Roux]
I'm going in for the kill
I'm doing it for a thrill
I'm hoping you'll understand
And I let go of my hand

[Verse 1: Lil Reese]
Rob who? I'll clap you up, boy that's an easy kill
Eighteen, but I'll transform him like a pill
I'm goin' hard, stomachache, bitch I need a meal
Think I'm playin'? The whole Lam' gotta eat forreal
We get it poppin', you'd be surprised who up in the field
300 tryna catch a body, call it Holyfield
The dour got me super focused, boy this shit ill
I'm drinkin' Remy, no chaser, 'til I fuckin' spill
I can't trust a soul, they ain't who they say they is
Niggas is bitches, they'll snitch you to a hundred years
A small circle, no new niggas, I ain't switchin' gears
A body gettin' dropped every day, this shit real
A lotta niggas say they real, they ain't really real
A lotta bitches say they bad, they ain't really bad
Niggas talkin' 'bout they cash, like what they had
Niggas say they got that bag, man they wish they had (that bag!)

[Chorus: La Roux]
I'm going in for the kill
I'm doing it for a thrill
I'm hoping you'll understand
And I let go of my hand

[Verse 2: Lil Durk]
Rob who? I'll clap you up, now that's an easy kill
Only The Family in my eyes, and nigga it's a drill
Fire a slug, got him sizzlin' like he Emmett Till
Niggas claim they in the streets, I'm out here for real
Can't trust too many bitches
They be low-key and sneaky
Pillow talkin' to niggas
Turned to be opposition
Now he woofin' to bitches
Why you woofin' these bitches?
Now he sleepin' with fishes
Two cups fucked up my vision
Ay Lil Moe, bro I miss you
After that I kept distance
Nobody tell me shit
You know that I won't listen
If I start, I'mma finish
To them I am a menace
I got the 40 in his mouth like I'm a dentist

[Chorus: La Roux]
I'm going in for the kill
I'm doing it for a thrill
I'm hoping you'll understand
And I let go of my hand
