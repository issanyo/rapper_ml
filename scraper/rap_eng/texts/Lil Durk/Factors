[Hook: Lil Durk]
Drugs, crackers
Robbers, scammers
Rappers, trappers
All the murderers
Non, factors
Factors, shooters
Packs, run up
Got 'em, got 'em
You're nobody 'til somebody kills you
But where I'm from you're nobody 'til you kill somebody
Know some shawtys under 12, they got bodies
Gotta hustle on your money to fight bodies

[Verse 1: Lil Durk]
I got addicted to drugs
Elementary hanging with thugs
Pop a ecstasy, made me a bug
When my family show me no love
Tryin' put the truth under the rug
Don't tweak, I'm a big capper
Your street nigga head capped guns
Chicago I don't cap one
I'm tryin' Trey Pound something
We out here Rose where I'm from
Only time D Rose and Simeon
Rest In Peace lil' Yummy, one of ours
Young nigga official, he a tootie
Every nigga in the city had a moment
Every nigga in the city keep it on 'em
My 2 hands never show it
Buy nick' bags come up short
Boy, we shooting on 1-on-1
Chanel glasses, these 1-of-1
Ain't have nothin', I was coming up
Now I'm rich, got me pourin' up
Durkio, bitch, I'm glowin' up
Street nigga, they need more of us
They'll never see them hoeing us

[Verse 2: Tee Grizzley]
Gotta robbed in my city, shit locked in
Can't hide in the club we gon' pop in
Y'all bullied them niggas, we not them
You ain't never in yo' life seen a Glock 10
They got my dog on tip
Shit, what's thats stoppin'? (nothin')
Wrap that bitch up good in a .40 and before you throw a hoodie on nigga we slidin'
Y'all niggas gotta one killer
And every conversation, that nigga our topic
Who gon' shoot for you when he gone?
Y'all stayin' in the house after we drop him
(Why you always talkin' 'bout guns?) What?
(Why you glorify murder?) What?
(Y'all niggas 'posed to be together) What?
(Y'all 'posed to stand up for a purpose)
Listen, where I'm from, it's a whole warzone goin' on
Where you from, that's probably unheard of
I can't squash it, they can't neither
For years, we been killin' each other's brothers
For years, my own hood hated each other
Started off fightin', ended up clutchin'
Ended up seein' them niggas in traffic
This time we was older
So niggas bustin', fuck it
