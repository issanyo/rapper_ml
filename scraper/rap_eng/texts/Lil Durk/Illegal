[Verse 1: Hypno Carlito]
Its illegal to do it like me
Can’t nobody do it like me
Hynpo Carlito got plug on the K
If you ever do something
Don’t care what you say
Cause this shit could be over the moment you think
Come quick
Won’t ever give you a moment to think
Lil mama she going she want me I think
Fuck in hotel bend her over the sink
The dope that I smoke is illegal
The kilo in back of the Rigo
Carlito be fly as an eagle
[?] on me and they come back to see you
Its illegal to have all these hoes
Illegal to sit back and drink on the road
Why they mad I'm the one that they chose
They bitchin’ at me like I’m one of they hoes
Its illegal to do what I do
Who would’ve knew sh*t
Who would’ve knew
Carlito would’ve been the one
I drip for two with the two
I just do what I do
Out with the law I just do what knew
Its illegal to try to be me and its cool to these streets
Ain’t no breaking’ the rules
