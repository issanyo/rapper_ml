[Chorus: Lil Durk]
Bitches and bottles
We who they follow
So jump on my campaign
And we made it
Turned up and we faded
So hold up your champagne
I'm turned up to the max, girl, I'm with the shits
These foreign cars and these foreign hoes, and they with the shits
Can't change up for a lil' fame and I'm with the shits
I'm turned up, you get turned out cause I'm with the shits

[Verse 1: King Louie]
My favorite shoes Prada
Due to the fact they comfortable
Tell 'em keep the rims
I wanna ride comfortable
She stress when she witchu
When she with me, she comfortable
I give two fucks about her
And judge her like Your Honor do
I'm 7-4-14
Shout out my 300 crew
With that AR-15
I'm drummin' like the drummers do
Die high life, I'm smokin' dope 'til Jesus done with me
Champagne bottles, which model am I gonna screw?
I just hit a lick, which Breitling am I gonna pick?
I just want some top, baby I don't really wanna hit
At the top it's just us
That's why we lookin' down and shit
Straight 8 rollin', all black, the marijuana lit
Got the 30s and the 40s and my youngins is the ones with them
Mismatchin' designer bitches, swagger like a mannequin
I be fly as fuck, I don't think I wanna land again
MUBU, OTF, them pussy niggas panickin'

[Chorus: Lil Durk]
Bitches and bottles
We who they follow
So jump on my campaign
And we made it
Turned up and we faded
So hold up your champagne
I'm turned up to the max, girl, I'm with the shits
These foreign cars and these foreign hoes, and they with the shits
Can't change up for a lil' fame and I'm with the shits
I'm turned up, you get turned out cause I'm with the shits

[Verse 2: Lil Durk]
I'm Lil Durk, I'm 300, I keep a bankroll
We fuckin' hoes, we turned up, D-Thang we Bang Bros
We keep the K, find a bitch to save, yeah we like to say hoes
We flexin' on 'em, finessin' on 'em, these niggas man hoes
These bitches bustin'
I fuck 'em, I can't trust 'em
That MAC I got be Russian
But my car from London
That mean my car got horses
My Polo say Ralph Lauren
These niggas, they be sneaky
I catch an opp, I'm scorin'
Kushy got my high
It got my molly boostin' too
I'm 2-4-14
Now shout out to my MUBU crew
L's up for my real niggas, L's up for my shooters too
RIP to King Lean, make them niggas do the woo

[Chorus: Lil Durk]
Bitches and bottles
We who they follow
So jump on my campaign
And we made it
Turned up and we faded
So hold up your champagne
I'm turned up to the max, girl, I'm with the shits
These foreign cars and these foreign hoes, and they with the shits
Can't change up for a lil' fame and I'm with the shits
I'm turned up, you get turned out cause I'm with the shits
