[Intro]
Ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-chop Squad

[Chorus: Lil Durk]
Shots fired, man down
Can't leave the crib without it, they not playin' 'round
I ain't have nobody, wasn't nobody 'round
One false move and I'll gun ya down
Suspect, suspect, suspect
I'm never the victim to no nothin'
No homicide, no nothin'
No robbery, no nothin'
Suspect
Suspect, suspect, suspect
I'm never the victim to no nothin'
No homicide, no nothin'
No robbery, no nothin'
Suspect

[Verse 1: Lil Durk]
What the fuck you know 'bout foenem?
Off the fuckin' dice rollin'
Send a fuck nigga the Stoegers
Better open your eyes 'fore I close 'em
I be with them niggas ferocious
Spendin' trap money on chokers
Get out, I gotta get in motion
Percocet fill up my cooler
If you die, won't give you no roses
Turn on my fashion clothing
Money got me back outspoken
In the middle of Chiraq, toasted
Say I'm done for, been back posted
Cleopatra potion
She a queen, I know it, mmm
Smokin' backyard boogie
Tax y'all, put tax on you fully
Racks out, girl give me that pussy
Chopper gon' amputate him fully
And these niggas animated fully, poof
Tom and Jerry
I was so mad, throwin' tantrums
My auntie was fightin' her cancer
Fucked up, I was lookin' for answers
Seems like it was only my family
My hood left me abandoned
Feel like they couldn't stand me
Can't go 'cause I got standards
That shit had made them panic
I been traded on, hated on
Told on, that's why I had a phone
My lil brother, he a hothead, I had to keep him close
My mama ain't want him in the city, told me, "Keep him gone"

[Chorus: Lil Durk]
Shots fired, man down
Can't leave the crib without it, they not playin' 'round
I ain't have nobody, wasn't nobody 'round
One false move and I'll gun ya down
Suspect, suspect, suspect
I'm never the victim to no nothin'
No homicide, no nothin'
No robbery, no nothin'
Suspect
Suspect, suspect, suspect
I'm never the victim to no nothin'
No homicide, no nothin'
No robbery, no nothin'
Suspect

[Verse 2: King Von]
In the field like a pitch
'Cause daddy was not in the picture (He wasn't)
I swear I'm in love with the pistol
You got blessed if I missed you (For real)
Confrontin' our problems and issues
I'm like man with a mission (I am)
And I get paid 'bout people I killed
But that shit won't make me no killer
'Cause killers don't talk about bodies (They don't)
We do that shit on the silent (For real)
When me and Zoo out slidin'
Rock, paper, scissors who drivin' (It's you)
Bitch I'm a shooter, I shoot out a Uber
If Zoo don't feel like drivin' (I do)
Nigga I'll do ya, I'll blow out ya noodles
And it ain't hard to find me (Bitch, I ain't hidin', for real)

[Chorus: Lil Durk]
Shots fired, man down
Can't leave the crib without it, they not playin' 'round
I ain't have nobody, wasn't nobody 'round
One false move and I'll gun ya down
Suspect, suspect, suspect
I'm never the victim to no nothin'
No homicide, no nothin'
No robbery, no nothin'
Suspect
Suspect, suspect, suspect
I'm never the victim to no nothin'
No homicide, no nothin'
No robbery, no nothin'
Suspect
