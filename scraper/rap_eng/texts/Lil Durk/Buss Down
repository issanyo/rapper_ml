[Chorus: Yung Tory]
This ice on my neck it's a trophy (it's a trophy, yeah)
Say you love me baby, you gotta show me
I ran that shit up on my lonely
She love me but she ain't the only
I don't need homies, I need the Rollie-oh
Buss down (buss down)
Yeah baby, buss down (buss down)
Your girl let me buss down (buss down)
Your girl let me buss down (buss down)
Buss down

[Verse 1: Yung Tory]
I need the buss down, I bet that she wanna fuck now
All these thotties they in love now
No Milwaukee, I got bucks now
Like what can you say now?
Young nigga on his way now
Shorty bussin' at the Greyhound
She give me top, don't make out
I smoke that great loud, with my white boy like 8-Mile
Bitch I go ape now, she eat me up like takeout
I'm on the plane, I'm takin' more flights
I need more ice, told the bitch she got four strikes
And boy you a lame, I can't even call you my guy
Seen the bullshit through my eyes
I ain't dumb, I'm a wiseguy
Its only the fam
Yeah I do this shit for Nine now (OTF)
I'm feelin' like King Kong, got wings on, I'm a fly-guy
Look at my ice, don't think twice, I just live my life
Livin' right, in the night, when we come alive
Losing, bro a shooter, yeah he keep a pipe
Hit my jeweler, yeah my diamonds they don't need a light

[Chorus: Yung Tory]
Buss down (buss down)
Yeah baby, buss down (buss down)
Your girl let me buss down (buss down)
Your girl let me buss down (buss down)
Buss down

[Verse 2: Lil Durk]
Can't wife if she a buss down
Audemars buss down
[???????????]
Hit her off WhatsApp
She a buss down, say she not but that's cap
Got my circle cut down, shit fa'real not just rap
Alexander one strap, the perky fuck her guts out
Put her on blast, she got clout
I put her ass in my mouth
Why did my homie cop out?
Wedding ring, buss down (Ooh)
I'm from that where you don't need friends
Put down them designers, put on these bands
What I paid for these new Lou's, it cost his rent
I was stuck at the bottom, shoes cement (yeah, yeah)

[Chorus: Yung Tory]
Buss down (buss down)
Yeah baby, buss down (buss down)
Your girl let me buss down (buss down)
Your girl let me buss down (buss down)
Buss down
