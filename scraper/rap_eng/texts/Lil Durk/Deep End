Lie down to sleep
Ayy I pray the lord my soul to keep
? I got the key
Pull up make all niggas bleed
I got water like overseas
Bitch I ball like NBA
Bitch I ball like MVP
I got money they envy me

I'm with the gang not with the mob
What was you thinkin'
Remember them days and that shit was hard
A nigga been thinkin'
I put a four in a twenty ounce
A nigga been drinkin'
If you with the squad I give you my heart
Lil nigga I mean it
I was fighting some demons
In the field bitch I'm deep in
I was raised in the deep end
I know niggas be sinkin'
Take yo bitch and go deep in
But I give her back why you tweakin'
Come around with that rah-rah
We leave you dead on the cement

With the gang we ain't playin' fair
Matter fact we don't play at all
OG words in the air
But we bout to run till we smoke it all
Puttin' on a front boy you better fall
We gon' kill em dead we gon' kill em all
Might spend a ten when I'm in the mall
I was on the bin with it in my draws
And they smokin' the black in
And they smokin' the black out
If he run blow his back down
I was gone but I'm back now
These niggas gon' fall
But I never back down
In the school I was trappin'
In the school you was class clown

Lie down to sleep
Ayy I pray the lord my soul to keep
? I got the key
Pull up make all niggas bleed
I got water like overseas
Bitch I ball like NBA
Bitch I ball like MVP
I got money they envy me

I'm with the gang not with the mob
What was you thinkin'
Remember them days and that shit was hard
A nigga been thinkin'
I put a four in a twenty ounce
A nigga been drinkin'
If you with the squad I give you my heart
Lil nigga I mean it
I was fighting some demons
In the field bitch I'm deep in
I was raised in the deep end
I know niggas be sinkin'
Take yo bitch and go deep in
But I give her back why you tweakin'
Come around with that rah-rah
We leave you dead on the cement
