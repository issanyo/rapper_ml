[Intro:]
No snake can snake me
Man I feel like I lived this life before
Like I seen this shit happen

[Chorus:]
We ain't got the same blood
We just brothers from the mud
Grew up in the same hood, and the violence so fucked up
A nigga can’t jugg
We gone sleep around each other till we neighbors
I'm just tryna wonder when this feeling in my pain stop
How you say you love me you my brother but got my name up
You must be crazy thinking I changed up
I'd do anything, plus give my fame up
You know I’ll give my fame up
You know I will never change up
You know I'm that dude but you let a lame fuck
You know I'm that dude but you let a lame fuck

[Verse 1:]
When I be gone off the ecstasy, shorty she gone get the best of me
And she know I be with killas, so family is not accepting me
I nutted all in her and left I told her I got vasectomy
Why them getting to @‘ing me?
Said they catching me they stretching me
Bronem be watching my back they know I be gone off the medicine
My cousin had died on cam, the police got footage and edit it
Big facts, on god, I can't get shit snatched
Can't leave I need that get back
Fuck shot I need you kidnapped
Suprise that the Glock come get frown
I tatted all my dead homies In my skin
Foenem cracking them BOA's, they need yo pins
Gulp a cup of my lean just to wash off my sins
Made my tri-state hoes buy me all my timbs

[Chorus:]
We ain't got the same blood
We just brothers from the mud
Grew up in the same hood, and the violence so fucked up
A nigga can't jugg
We gone sleep around each other till we neighbors
I’m just tryna wonder when this feeling in my pain stop
How you say you love me you my brother but got my name up
You must be crazy thinking I changed up
I’d do anything, plus give my fame up
You know I'll give my fame up
You know I will never change up
You know I’m that dude but you let a lame fuck
You know I'm that dude but you let a lame fuck

[Verse 2:]
Yo homies say they on me, i be with killas and parolees
Them niggas police, I know they name, bruh
You be rapping about that trap but ain't never sold nothing
I hold a grudge back in 09 you ain't let me hold nothing
You cheat on me I swear I beat you like you stole something
Pillow talking to these hoes, yeah you cold blooded
How you follow me on the gram and you don’t like pics
I fucked a bitch she like all girls she don't like dick
Cum on my night sheets, they don't like this
Bad bitch a Pisces, I keep a night stick
I swear I'm at my nicest been through my crisis
We not to be played with, they on they night shift
Niggas try to stick me up, they can never show no love
That petty shit let go I told you i ain't got no grudge
I don't give a fuck I'm addicted to these drugs
When I was down and gone them niggas ain't send me nothing
Sip red, i ain't fucking with tussin'
Wipe down, I'm bussin'
Shoot first, you clutching
You mad I pressed yo button
You know we read yo mind, my niggas ain't ducking
You know you play with mines ain't no discussion

[Chorus:]
We ain't got the same blood
We just brothers from the mud
Grew up in the same hood, and the violence so fucked up
A nigga can't jugg
We gone sleep around each other till we neighbors
I'm just tryna wonder when this feeling in my pain stop
How you say you love me you my brother but got my name up
You must be crazy thinking I changed up
I'd do anything, plus give my fame up
You know I'll give my fame up
You know I will never change up
You know I'm that dude but you let a lame fuck
You know I'm that dude but you let a lame fuck
