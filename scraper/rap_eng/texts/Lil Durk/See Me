[Hook: French Montana]
What you wanna do, babe?
‘Cause I got all night
From the block to the cruise, babe
I got nothing but time
I know you see it now
I been told 'em you can see it now
Hope you fuck niggas see me now
All the bitches see me now
Oh, hope you see me now
Han, see me now
Han, wish you'd see me now
Han, see me now

[Verse 1: French Montana]
Han, see me now
Watch and chain 3D now
Looking like popping out your TV now
Dark black shades like I'm Stevie now
You should see how the bad bitches treat me now
Screaming, she gon' need me, baby how
She want the [?], we can work it out
Drinking lean and smoking loud
Overload
Riding on fo'
Don't hit me on my phone
Don't call me home

[Hook: French Montana]
What you wanna do, babe?
‘Cause I got all night
From the block to the cruise, babe
I got nothing but time
I know you see it now
I been told 'em you can see it now
Hope you fuck niggas see me now
All the bitches see me now
Oh, hope you see me now
Han, see me now
Han, wish you'd see me now
Han, see me now

[Verse 2: Lil Durk]
I'm so on that you speakin' now
I told my lawyer that I'm beatin' trial
I'm hearing rumors when they see me 'round
That's why I keep that semi now
Oh I got a boy, he wanna see me now
Dressing like I dress they wanna be me now
Back then, they ain't want me, Mike Jones
Now I got the same kind of watch that Mike own
Or a dollar and a dream just like Trey Songz
Hello, I need ten bricks, don't hit the payphone
And you don't want this war, stay in a safe zone
I got guns, you got guns, even on this track [?]

[Hook: French Montana]
What you wanna do, babe?
‘Cause I got all night
From the block to the cruise, babe
I got nothing but time
I know you see it now
I been told 'em you can see it now
Hope you fuck niggas see me now
All the bitches see me now
Oh, hope you see me now
Han, see me now
Han, wish you'd see me now
Han, see me now
