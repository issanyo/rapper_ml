[Verse 1: Lil Durk]
I got syrup in my trap house
Somethin' like a Waffle House
Try to steal out my trap
I'ma have Lud Foe come and wipe 'em out
Yeah, yeah
I swear it's doin' numbers
I'm fuckin' with a rubber
My niggas gettin' money
So fuck if you don't love me
You niggas wanna kill me
But niggas tryna hug me
They act like they love me
Wanna cop me, they a dummy
But my trap house a Waffle House
Sippin' lean for my sadness
Got a bad bitch for dessert
Got a bad bitch for dessert
Cause my trap house like a Waffle House, yeah

[Verse 2: Young Dolph]
My trap house rollin'
That young nigga global
Trappin' out a Rover
Pulled up on your bitch
It was hard for her to keep her composure
Cough syrup in my soda
Call my plug, say, "Hurry up, nigga! What's the hold up?"
I got family to feed, it cost the most to please
80 racks on my arm when I roll up my sleeve
Another 50 on the charm cause I've been boomin' Ps
Sittin' in the hot tub smokin' weed and watchin' TV
Diamonds dancin', that's how you know it's me when you see me
My phone blowin' up (hello?)
The trap goin' crazy (pull up)
They can't get enough
Dolphy got them flavors
I'll shut your trap down
The best prices in town
It's Dolph

[Verse 3: Young Thug]
I trap out my mama's house
I eat at the Waffle House
I see what you're talkin' 'bout
If you be what I'm talkin' 'bout
I shot him the other day
Cause what he was talkin' 'bout (what you was sayin')
Real killers don't say no words
Lil Durk got 300 birds
I'm ridin' with a stick and I'm ridin' with your bitch
I nut on her face, I'ma nut on them tits
Yeah, nut, I whip up some eggs and I scramble the shit
Cook, nigga don't play if you not 'bout this shit
Ambulance, they gon' wait on the bitch
I got them diamonds and now you see my face
I'm mothafuckin' blessed
While I'm trappin', I trap out the Waffle House
Lil Durk, he smoke blunt like a bomboclat
Pay attention, get the formula
I'm ridin' with Snoop Dogg like I'm Bow Wow now
Don't cut my dope or we're fallin' out (murder)
We step in the club and it's snowin' now
Diamonds so wet like a water fountain
Plus, this that 300 shit, Durk gonna tell the bitch

[Outro: Young Thug]
We got grits for the low

Tony Montana, they for the low
Spend it on my son, man that body low
Hundred racks spent on your hoe
That's why she don't say no
My money green like a pear
Who you want for Durk, you know she said...
