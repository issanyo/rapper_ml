Me, I'm the best that I can be
Shit's hard when you trying to make it when you molded from the streets
See my nigga's called me Riley, I was playing with the heat
On parole I got a son so lord knows he got to eat
Unhealthy for the fake nigga's
Anti straight nigga's
You nigga's is pussy they be working with the state nigga
Part time hustler, full time Jake nigga
You'd think I'm a different race the way my team hate nigga
OTF the family, lowkey we some dying breeds
Real nigga no I in team, quick to shoot no eyeing me
Stojakovic, miss Tayski and Moe I know I was proud of em
OTF until I die, L's up my partner nem

[Dialogue]

Mamma good, daddy gone heartless hell where I'm from
Police get killed left and right blame it on my nigga Rio
Police stopped his phone cause it's good hoping he know
November 29th born my baby boy Lil Lolo
Riding smoking, four nigga's strapped in my red photo
Police trynna leave me hanging cause I'm hanging where they banging
Lil nigga's be slanging coke why not they just lost their hope
Like I tell my lil bro life ain't no joke nigga, spending life as a dope dealer
Stayed ahead you know go nigga
Can't hold on with no rope nigga so stay strong and keep hope nigga
I spit raw with no coke nigga, L's up for my bro nigga, L's up for Lil moe nigga

[Dialogue]
Keep it real, I was only 13 playing in the field
Got caught with a 30 slammer, keep the heat to see a mil
Friends hating on me plotting on me for a couple bills
They say I'ma lose my deal but I say that's motivation
Crazy how I grew up with you, tell me whats the point of hating
You say you gon' kill me then, tell me what's the point you making
Cut the dreads, use to tell the bitches I was part Jamaican
Love you and I miss you Tayski, you gon' cry when you see me make it, L's
