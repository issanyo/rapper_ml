[Intro]
TK Kravitz

[Verse 1: TK Kravitz]
Baby, you know how I'm coming
I came up from nothing
That's why I can't fuck with you niggas who be fronting
If you my dawg, you my dawg for real, for you I kill
If I got it then you got it too, that's the deal
Just don't change on me, my nigga
My life can't get no bigger
I became a big spender
But you still don't get the picture
That money don't mean shit to me
That money don't mean shit to me

[Chorus: TK Kravitz]
I notice everybody love you when you got something to give (Everybody, I'm talking everybody)
But what if I ain't have it?
Would you still be my rib? (My rib!)
If I didn't have nothing to give
What if I ain't have nothing to give?
What if I ain't have nothing to give?

[Verse 2: Lil Durk]
I lost so many niggas, I dropped a tear about 'em
We drop couple of their niggas, you don't hear about it
I tell my niggas I love them to death, that's on my dead body
I don't wanna give up my life to anybody
Think they finessing, Durk will not help 'em out
'Cause I want they ass to win and take a better route
Wish Law ain't take that 15, he ain't settle well
They get 'em off the street, they had to set 'em down

[Chorus: TK Kravitz]
I notice everybody love you when you got something to give (Everybody, I'm talking everybody)
But what if I ain't have it?
Would you still be my rib? (My rib!)
If I didn't have nothing to give
What if I ain't have nothing to give?
What if I ain't have nothing to give?

[Verse 3: Lil Durk]
My momma said I don't love nobody but codeine
Trapping like a fool till my pockets obese
Real copped to ten murders, on the police
Gave him 20 years, still send him money every week
I feel like, we don't work, we don't care, we don't never speak
Told my team need plaques so I don't never sleep
I'm forever real, I'm from the mud, believe
Can't struggle when I'm rich, I had to go and cheat

[Chorus: TK Kravitz]
I notice everybody love you when you got something to give (Everybody, I'm talking everybody)
But what if I ain't have it?
Would you still be my rib? (My rib!)
If I didn't have nothing to give
What if I ain't have nothing to give?
What if I ain't have nothing to give?
What if I ain't have nothing to give?
What if I ain't have nothing to give?
