[Intro]
I told you I ain't gon' leave you
It's your swag though
Them Chanel Tennicitos (DY Krazy)
That you in

[Chorus]
It's gon' be okay, okay, okay
Just don't leave, okay, okay, okay
Baby lead the way, the way
Yeah, yeah, the way, the way
(Oh oh)
When you caught me cheatin', I caught amnesia (Oh oh)
And I'm Durkio, it's nice to meet you (Oh oh)
And she sexy, she got her features (Mmh mmh mmh)
When I see you down, I pick up the pieces (Pick up the pieces)

[Verse 1]
I was feeling like a clown, I thought you would leave me
I let them get inside my head (Okay, okay, okay)
I know you wishin' I was dead (Okay, okay, okay)
And she won't put up with my bullshit (Won't nah)
The way I make that pussy scream, she think I'm hood rich (Think I'm hood rich, yeah yeah)
They couldn't imagine us, we got 'em mad as fuck (Oh oh)
I'ma get your Patek bust, I'ma let you count it up (Yeah yeah)
Bust down Patek for me (Turn up)
Put my dick on her teeth (Turn up)
Fucked up and gave her the key (Skrrt)
I gave her the recipe (Turn up)
I got my head in the streets (Got my head in the streets)
She like when I suck on her feet (She like when I suck on her feet)
She in love with me
She like it doggy style (She like it doggy style)
She count up a hundred thou' (She count up a hundred thou')
Cheat on me, it can't be long
Pass me the drugs, my high comin' down

[Chorus]
It's gon' be okay, okay, okay
Just don't leave, okay, okay, okay
Baby lead the way, the way
Yeah, yeah, the way, the way
I'm talkin' 'bout today, right now, I need you (Oh oh)
When you caught me cheatin', I caught amnesia (Oh oh)
And I'm Durkio, it's nice to meet you (Oh oh)
And she sexy, she got her features (Mmh mmh mmh)
When I see you down, I pick up the pieces (Pick up the pieces)
I was feeling like a clown, I thought you would leave me

[Verse 2]
And I can't let nobody tell me that my bitch goin'
And we got strong mind, I told her we gon' get through it, oh oh
In her Rick Owens, I had to put my rent on it
And I was broke as hell, she thought I had some shit goin'
No, I don't want your number
No, I don't want to give you mine, and no
And I'm so cocky, got a big ego
Her head so sloppy, got to take off these drawers
You ain't gotta worry 'bout me vanishing
And I'm down for the cause and the challenges
I fell out with my dawg 'bout money, it was not 'bout a bitch
But he told her I had a girl, but he told her right before I hit
She say I run my mouth 'cause I told my guys I hit
But he was with me when I seen you, I said I gotta hit
And I knew he was kinda hatin', he said I got a bitch
They DM'ed her from a fake page but it was too accurate
It was him
Edible arrangement, bring flowers
Couldn't say I cheated 'cause I was a bachelor
That pussy pancakes, my tongue a spatula
And I take Adderall so I can add it up
My first gun was a Smith & Wesson
These ain't no SI's, these VVS's
I was in them trenches, yeah I need a blessing
Couldn't get into good school, I was getting rejected
No, I don't want to meet you nowhere
No, I don't want none of your time, and no
No make-up, no inches, no lipo
And I know that you know I'm psycho
Love her perfume, bring me more shrooms
My heart got no room, I don't need no tomb
No I won't hurt you, 'cause we global
The world know you, the world know you

[Chorus]
It's gon' be okay, okay, okay
Just don't leave, okay, okay, okay
Baby lead the way, the way
Yeah, yeah, the way, the way
I'm talkin' 'bout today, right now, I need you (Oh oh)
When you caught me cheatin', I caught amnesia (Oh oh)
And I'm Durkio, it's nice to meet you (Oh oh)
And she sexy, she got her features (Mmh mmh mmh)
