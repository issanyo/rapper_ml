[Intro]
Monsta's gon’ tear it up

[Chorus: PnB Rock]
I pull up and swerve (Swerve)
These niggas, they gon' some nerve (Nerve)
Play with the gang, you get murked (Murked)
I used to trap out the dirt (Dirt)
I bought my bitch a new purse (Purse)
You knew it came wit' the fur (Fur)
I be so high off this herb, oh shit
I pull up and swerve (Swerve)
These niggas, they got some nerve (Nerve)
Play with the gang, you get murked (Murked)
I used to trap out the dirt (Dirt)
I bought my bitch a new purse (Purse)
You knew it came wit’ the fur (Fur)
I get so high off this herb (Berb)
Oh shit

[Verse 1: PnB Rock]
12 on my ass, I'm like fuck it (fuck it)
Still ridin' 'round wit' them sticks in a bucket (A buck-buck)
Still wit' my young niggas and them niggas clutchin' (Huh)
Just waitin' for an Opp nigga, see him, we gon’ bust ’em (Brrt)
Quarter mil', hangin’ on my neck, bitch, come touch it (Come touch it)
You get killed right on the spot, bitch it's nothin' (Brrt)
We don't do no fightin’, oh no we don't do no tusslin' (Oh no)
30 bands, I could have your head in an oven (Bitch)
I do the digital dash, all of this cash, I'm in my bitch, damn (Skrt)
I heard you goin' all sad, they took ya chain, you ain't do shit, damn
Damn, lil' nigga, you a bitch, damn
And I heard that you made you strip down
Look at me, I got the drip now
Niggas ain't takin' my shit, ohh (Ohh)
Bitch I'm strapped down

[Chorus: PnB Rock]
I pull up and swerve (Yuh)
These niggas, they gon' some nerve
Play with the gang, you get murked (Brrt)
I used to trap out the dirt (Yuh)
I bought my bitch a new purse (Woah)
You knew it came wit' the fur (Fur)
I be so high off this herb, oh shit (Shit)
Huh, I pull up and swerve (Shit)
These niggas, they gon' some nerve (Brrt)
Play with the gang, you get murked (Brrt)
I used to trap out the dirt (Woo)
I bought my bitch a new purse (Yuh)
You knew it came wit' the fur (Yuh)
I get so high off this herb (Oh, oh)
Oh shit

[Verse 2: Lil Durk]
I miss the Perc in the Act'
She gave me head on my back (On my back)
Say you got these streets, that's cap
They take yo' shit, go get it back
Vacuum seal, can't smell that
Choppas in a Hellcat
Different drugs, that's trail mix
Choppas, FN shells mix
All these diamonds, will it end?
I know a booster gave her ten
I fucked a weak ho, that was D
Around my bitch won't mention it
YSL clothes, leave that stitch
She fuck my mans, 'bout to leave your bitch
AMG, go get that kick
I move around without my stick
All these niggas gon' call the boys
Back then, trappin', Corduroy's
Half an M, gotta order four, yeah
Chase, DO8
I'm rich now, it's gon' be okay (Be okay)
Got my feet all laced
Try to rob us, DO8

[Chorus: PnB Rock]
I pull up and swerve (Yuh)
These niggas, they gon' some nerve (They got some nerve)
Play with the gang, you get murked (Brrt)
I used to trap out the dirt (Trap)
I bought my bitch a new purse (Woah)
You knew it came wit' the fur (Yuh)
I be so high off this herb, oh shit (Shit)
Huh, I pull up and swerve (Shit)
These niggas, they gon' some nerve (Brrt)
Play with the gang, you get murked (Brrt)
I used to trap out the dirt (Woo)
I bought my bitch a new purse (Yuh)
You knew it came wit' the fur (Yuh)
I be so high off this herb
Oh shit (Oh shit)
