[Intro: Lil Durk & Ralo]
Let’s get it pussy
Yeah
Dope
OTF
You know how we rockin’ nigga, only the Famgoon shit
Only the Famgoon nigga
Haha
Hey Durk
Turn up

[Verse 1: Ralo]
OG, I’m with OTF and you know we verse anybody
Durk told me that they forgot
He think they forgot about it
How 'bout we reminding niggas
Who the fuck behind these niggas?
Fuck whoever signed these niggas
We shoot whoever ridin’ with ‘em

[Verse 2: Lil Durk]
I’m hanging with the robbers and the scammers
I’ma put a pint inside a Fanta
Only the Famgoon, fuck these rappers
Big dinosaur four-five like a raptor
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Ralo told a nigga slide to Pakistan
Got my niggas with me so you know we packed the van
Blood in my eyes like I’m Fifty man
Started with a million, that’s how I’ma end

[Verse 3: Ralo]
Started with a million we end with a billion
Everything changed when we came in the building
Having this paper, one hell of a feeling
Fuck with Lil Durk and my niggas start killing
Just left out the back and we flew to Chiraq
I promised Lil Durk we wouldn’t ever look back
And we get them racks and we split it up
Won’t none of these niggas be big as us
You keep it loyal, I do the same
Tell on my team when I lose a game
He was talkin’ ‘til that Uzi came
Run your mouth, we start shootin’ things
We ain’t never lettin’ shit slide
We ain’t never gon’ switch sides
I get money, I don’t get tired
Go get your own and stop dick ridin’

[Verse 4: Lil Durk]
First ran a band off street money
Had to trap up on that three some’
Lean, percocets, xanny (drugs)
Yeah I just had a threesome
I can’t wait ‘til they make the fifty shot for the four-five Glock
Got out early for my case, you been fighting years, you a cop
Real name Durk, you can call me Mustafa (Abdul Malik)
I don’t know no niggas, I don’t know who shot ya
Run up on his ass like, I got ya
Real street niggas don’t go off gossip

[Verse 5: Ralo]
We don’t go off gossip nigga
Talkin’ shit and we gon’ pop a nigga
I walk in the club with a lot of niggas
That’s how you know it’s a lot of pistols
We never playin’ no peekaboo
We never lyin’ on interviews
You know that you was a bitch in school
I was that nigga that pick on you
I’m the nigga that’ll take your lunch
We gon’ take his shit for say what you want
You know that I was the bully
Ain’t nobody stood up to me
Ain’t no nigga said shit to me
You can ask the nigga next to me
They don’t never send threats of me
They don’t want a nigga neck tooken

[Verse 6: Lil Durk]
Alexander Wang belt, hot boy like Wayne ‘nem
I might OD off the painkillers
In the trenches with the same niggas
I be turn up with the fashion shit
Mouth shut so don’t ask me shit
MAC with the cooler attached to it
You know I ain’t with that lackin’ shit
In my circle ain’t no lames
Cartiers with the gold frames
Three-nine like a soul train
Got a soul plane like Snoop in it
Dummy bags with the woop in it
Crib big, put a hoop in it
Garage big, put the coupe in it
Off the jigga, got the moon whippin’

[Verse 7: Ralo]
We do not rent out apartments
We go and buy up the complex
She better not get in this Corvette
We gonna have us some car sex
We walk in the club and we flood it out
I bought the Rollie and flood it out
Baby mama used to cut me out
Now we ain’t got nothin’ to worry ‘bout
We ain’t worried ‘bout another nigga
You see he got all his brothers with him
That’s why the streets really love a nigga
‘Cause we ain’t none’ like these other niggas
We don’t fuck with the other side
They gon’ make us bring them colors out
Any nigga standing by your side
It gon’ be a double homicide
It’s Durk and Ralo, man we living good
You know we turn up in any hood
We the only rappers in the hood
Ain’t did it yet, but we finna do it
Watch what we do to these niggas
We ain’t that cool with these niggas
We do not move with these niggas
We do not fool with these niggas

[Outro: Ralo]
That shit there crazy Durk
That motherfucker go crazy
That the outro, we out
Famgoon! OTF
