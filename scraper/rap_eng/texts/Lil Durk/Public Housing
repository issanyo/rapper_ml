[Intro]
For real like
I'm saying they count us out at the right time
You know what I'm saying
That gave us motivation to tuck and gotta do what we do
You know what I'm saying I got the city on my back you know

[Hook]
I came from public houses to a mansion
I lost my family I was feelin' stranded
I seen my son he a throw a tantrum
Call a couple bitches cause I had no manners
I asked Allah can he give me guidance
Full of anger I was in out my mind and
I know this music is my soul passion
Last week I spent fifty thousand on my fashion

[Verse 1]
On red carpet feelin' like Alladin
Got a bitch from Tokyo I like her accent
Julio Jones ballin' on Madden
On top enjoy my risin'
Smokin' woods like I'm in a cabin
Goin' broke I cannot imagine
No way, how you blastin' if you plastic
Imma turn wit da cheque get my momma a new crib
I ain't talking Kodak Black imma get a new crib
I just paid for my side bitch to get a titties filled
And she tried to suck me up for them new Fendi heels
I been in it for a long time need some new deals
I been in 4gs it for a long time need some new wheels
Percocet with the Xanax, need some new pills
Traded in that new Hellcat to see a coup wheel
Turn up

[Hook]
I came from public houses to a mansion
I lost my family I was feelin' stranded
I seen my son he a throw a tantrum
Call a couple bitches cause I had no manners
I asked Allah can he give me guidance
Full of anger I was in out my mind and
I know this music is my soul passion
Last week I spent fifty thousand on my fashion

[Verse 2]
I'm with Zoey on the jet skis
Canâ€™t wife no hoes on nuski
Two cars imma switch keys
Fuck the old heads they miss lead
Only the family stand for family
I lost my blood thats insanity
Shout out Tory cuz he signed to me
I'm wit a boss bitch count them gs
Count my cheese up
Got a passport she got a Visa
Its perfect picture Mona Lisa
They did't believe us
Hope they never need us
While the police try to discriminate us
And I got these diamonds just to please my haters
Gotta get this money gotta chase that paper
While these niggas try to assassinate us
I got a Glock and it came with lasers

[Hook]
I came from public houses to a mansion
I lost my family I was feelin' stranded
I seen my son he a throw a tantrum
Call a couple bitches cause I had no manners
I asked Allah can he give me guidance
Full of anger I was in out my mind and
I know this music is my soul passion
Last week I spent fifty thousand on my fashion
