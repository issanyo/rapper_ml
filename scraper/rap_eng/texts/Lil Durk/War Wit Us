[Verse 1: Lil Durk]
How you want war and you ain't eating?
What they gon' do if you ain't breathing?
Bodies back to back, bitch we ain't even
Bitch I'm in that pussy cause I'm so conceited
Word around town that you sneak dissing
Bullets must be blank cause they keep missing
Face up on that flyer if you want attention
You just want some fame boy you ain't in it
Better get to ducking if my name's mentioned
I hopped into that foreign, bitch I'm lane switching
And bitch I'm OTF and I ain't switching
Niggas see I'm hot and they want me gone
I heard his ass was singing like he OVO
Bitch go cop a Rollie not a rodeo
And when we in the building it's a rollie show
And I be sipping lean while they smoking dope

[Hook]
War with us, they don't want war with us
Them bullets go bang, bitch them bullets go bang
No war with us, they don't want no war with us
Them bullets go bang, bitch them bullets go bang
And you can't hang where my niggas hang
Cause where we hang all we do is bang
No war with us, they don't want no war with us
Them bullets go bang, bitch them bullets go bang

[Verse 2: Lil Durk]
Nigga talking 'bout that we got beef
Know a couple shooters posted over East
Broski got the 30 broski like to tweak
See me he don't say shit but he go and tweet
Put me in that jam I don't know shit
He ain't have a hit since '06
Niggas holding weight, get they door kicked
Spent 1500 dollars on these low kicks
Broke niggas always fuck with broke bitches
Master P with my shooters, they ain't go no limits
You can't hang around me and be my co defendant
Way broski flipping bricks he should be a gymnast
A gymnast in the kitchen, we cookin, we cookin, we cookin, let's get it
808 in that clip go bang
All white Panamera, cocaine
If he tryna rob then we get his brain
