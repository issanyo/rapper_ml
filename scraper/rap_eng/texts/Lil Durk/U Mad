[Hook: Lil Mouse] x2
Came up how I came up so I guess you mad
With a car like this and a house like this I guess you mad
With my pockets on full so I guess you mad
I live life to the fullest so I guess you mad

[Verse 1: Lil Mouse]
Came up from the bottom so I guess you mad
Pull up in a drop-top 'Rari, they like "Who is that?"
VVS's in my chain, I know why you mad
Everywhere I go they know me, ain't no "Who is that?"
Gettin' money on my mind, I'm so into that
If I spend some money I'ma get it back
Boy, I'm headed to the top and I ain't looking back
Can't wear no skinny pants, cause they can't fit my racks
I'm just running to the money like a Running Back
Don't care nothing about it if it ain't a cheque
Lil flexin', I just spent a sack
I'm the number one young stunter, I know why you mad
