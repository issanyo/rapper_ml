[Intro]
Check, check, check
(C-Sick, C-Sick, C-Sick)

[Verse 1: Tink]
Up like a pilot
The money's so violent
We valet the whip and then run in the spot
Feeling important, too fly like I'm Jordan
A ring cost a mil, that's a real milly rock
Rockin' designer, now we on the meter
Loafs on my feet cost a whole lotta peta
Piece on my hip like a motherfuckin' beeper
Don't let it ring off
Car full of niggas who know how to get you
And do you in minimum time
Run through the bank
And deposit more cake than a baker would bake for her bride
March in the buildin'
They all get filmin' like we got a movie to cut
Shoot out the dealer
I'm hot as a fever the formula white like it's in the Ku Klux

[Interlude: Tink]
The point is this shit don't really stop
Whole lotta money bein' made
Niggas know what time it is, you know

[Hook: Tink]
All day, all night
I stay on it, I stay on it
All day, all night
I stay on it, I stay on it

[Verse 2: Lil Durk]
All white with the Loubs on
I aye where yuh blue, get your cruise on
Take it slow, less talk, get your cruise on
Chanel purse, Jimmy Choo on
Street nigga and I'm on what you want
Street nigga and I'm on what you want
All day, all night baby
Ex-bitch call my phone tryna fight, let's go
No I want you
Street nigga with a melody
Only nigga in Toronto with a felony
On Eastside bitch but I'm tellin' you
And "you Lil Durk crazy" what you tellin' me
Yeah, what you tellin' me
Straight out the gutter
I ain't got a shame, people less more (?)
I'm lovin' the way you
And you lovin' the way I
Smell like the money
Since I met you girl, you been 100
Took you from your man and he ain't know nothin'
Yeah, he stuntin'
Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Interlude: Tink]
Uh, let's go and get this shit two times, you know?
I'm back to back
They don't know
Haha
Durk what up
Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Hook: Tink]
All day, all night
I stay on it, I stay on it
All day, all night
I stay on it, I stay on it
