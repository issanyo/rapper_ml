[Chorus: Lil Durk]
Got to take a lot of drugs
To get you out my system
And I fell right out of love
So I got to mention
It's not comfortable
I got to get on
I was broke down to the floor
I had to get on
I, got to get you out of my system
It's crazy
That I got you on my system

[Verse 1: Lil Durk]
Got me so deep inside my feelings
And I can't let you starve
I had to make money
Cartier my lens
Gucci my friends
Like, fuck my ex
Ooh, like fuck my past
Suck my dick in a fast car
Don't make a mess
Check your DM
That's my mans
Yeah, that shit a test
I lick your feet down to your thighs
Then lick your chest
I see the roll all on your ass
Like, damn I'm blessed
Get out of my ear
They say you a finnesser
Get out of my ear
They said you like the rest of 'em
But I don't listen to 'em
They see we swaggin'
That shit gettin' to 'em

[Chorus: Lil Durk]
Got to take a lot of drugs
To get you out my system
And I fell right out of love
So I got to mention
It's not comfortable
I got to get on
I was broke down to the floor
I had to get on
I, got to get you out of my system
It's crazy
That I got you on my system

[Verse 2: Young Chop]
Do this shit on the daily
Fuckin' that bitch she go crazy
And, nah, you cannot play me
And, nah, you cannot play me
You ask me for money
You must think I'm crazy
You faking your pregnancy
Where's the baby?
Now you blowin' my line up
Talkin' bout why I ain't answer?
Callin' my auntie and shit
Like, what is his problem?
Bitch you know why
Bitch you know why
Callin' me private
So I put my phone on silent
I'ma throw my feelings away
Ain't thinking bout you no more

[Chorus: Lil Durk]
Got to take a lot of drugs
To get you out my system
And I fell right out of love
So I got to mention
It's not comfortable
I got to get on
I was broke down to the floor
I had to get on
I, got to get you out of my system
It's crazy
That I got you on my system
