[Hook x2]
Gettin' money, throw it up
We at the top
Poppin' bottles, pour it up
We at the top
Niggas hating, they just mad cuz
We at the top [x3]

[Verse 1: OTF NuNu]
We at the top, since we came
Up from nothin'
Now we flexin', gettin' money
World star, where we be stuntin'
We just kick it like we puntin'
Broke niggas go get money
Cars from another country
Run up on me, you a dummy
My bitches match my car
Rolleos to Audemars
Off a deuce, I just hit Mars
We be coolin' with the stars
Diamonds shining like a star
OTF, that's who we are
FTO its fuck a opp
I can't relate if you a opp
At the top we hit the scene
All my niggas gettin' that green
Nothing but hitters on my team
Fuck a bitch, I'm chasing dreams
Cashin' out on anything
Money buy you anything
Take 'em down for everything
All these hundreds, they on me
And my pistol stay on me
Louie Belt and Louie Tee
Robin hat and Robin jeans
I got diamonds on my wings
I be flexin', I be free
Hand guns and 223s
Run up on me, you will see
Man down, it's RIP

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Lil Durk]
At the top of the top
Niggas say Lil' Durk ain't guap
Never wife, never staying with a thot
One thing never say it to the cops
Real nigga, real nigga, better trust in me
That's why these real bitches fuck with me
And all this money, that's a drug to me
That's why the hoes love me
Might call, my name is ugly
But that lean got to Pluto
I'm boss of the boss like Hugo
Shine, nigga, nigga, you know
Now run up
Celebration with the squad
Tell 'em pour up
One thing 'bout my niggas
They gon' turn up
Million dollar nigga, turn down for what?
These bitches ain't me, they mad
They show up like mud
Tell it to my lawyer, fuck the judge
They gave me ten, want me to lose
But I gotta win
And now it's a celebration
Now, why the fuck these niggas hate us?
I'm leanin like a fuckin patient
Headed to the top and I'm impatient
