[Intro]
Yeah, baby what you do to me
Let's take a ride baby
Let's take a ride baby

Take a ride with me in my car, don’t take it wrong I’m a star
I want you baby go hard, let’s take a ride off to Mars
Couple hate you baby, I made it
Everybody left you, I’ll take you
You backing out of relations, if we ain’t got a relation baby

[Hook]
What you do to me, what you do to me
Baby what you do to me, what you do to me

[Verse 1]
We can make magic, you fuck with a savage
You need me the most, I hop out of traffic
Fuck my nigga right now, if you need me right now
I come to lay that pipe down, but I can’t fight you right now
Did you give me something baby, cause you got me going crazy
Chanel bag, Birkin bag, Louis too, Gucci shoes
You feeling me I’m feeling you
Real nigga need a real bitch
Just somebody just to chill with
Bend you over grab the mirror
Open the window so they can hear you
The way you look at me, grab that Brazilian
Them chances one of a million

[Hook]
What you do to me, what you do to me
Baby what you do to me, what you do to me
Baby what you do to me, what you do to me

Take a ride off in my car, don’t take it wrong I’m a star
I want you baby go hard, let’s take off to Mars
Baby what you do to me, what you do to me

[Verse 2]
What's up, baby let me know what's up
Up against the world baby

Her lips got me going crazy
Make a man for your Insta
Nigga want to fuck because of your Insta
Next day fucking your sister
Can’t be mad, baby it’s pimping
Baby I’m different, I want to be faithful
Baby just listen, I want to be grateful
I love you and I hate you, through the bullshit I take you
Wifey I make you, let’s take me a vacation
So I do what I want, baby I love you
I do what I want, they just want to fuck you
So what you do to me

[Hook]
What you do to me, what you do to me
Baby what you do to me, what you do to me
Baby what you do to me, what you do to me
What you do to me, baby what you do to me
Take a ride off in my car, don’t take it wrong I’m a star
I want you baby go hard, let’s take off to Mars
Baby what you do to me, what you do to me
Baby what you do to me, what you do to me
