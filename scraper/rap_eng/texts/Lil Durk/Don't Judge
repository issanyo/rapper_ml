They be tryna judge me
I thought that they loved me
But they don't really know me
Please don't judge me (don't judge)
Don't judge me (don't judge)
They be tryna judge me
They don't know my story
They be wanting to hate me
Don't judge me (don't judge me)
Don't judge me (don't judge me)

[Verse 1: Lil Durk]
Loyalty was the key to these street niggas (let's get it!)
Chains, cars, cribs, since a kid I used to think I was Meech nigga
Starving, crib full of family I can't sleep without balling
So I watch D Rose play (often)
Aunty died from cancer so I rap to keep the laugh
I'd rather pray when I'm alone instead of giving shit to pastors
Daddy gone since I was a in pampers
He get out when I'm in pampers
Old and a dead man, hand still on the hammer
Niggas talking 'bout they my mans and we friends
Where you was you at when that man with that lanz offered me ten?
Shackled up, with the niggas that we hit with the fan
Eating shit that we gathered in blan
President still black, I hope he change shit
Niggas out here fifty, doing the same shit
When he say he got my back he ran quick
Don't judge me
I know the streets love me
(Yeah, talk to em)

[Verse 2: Lil Durk]
Dope dealers, cold killers, day 1 niggas told nigga
Half them killers told on em
Had my chopper and road with em
My mouth close though
I can't snitch on a nigga pillow talking to ops and hoes bitch of a nigga
Summer nights, all them drugs made me kill shit
I lost so many niggas if they die I don't feel shit
Been on IG with me man, just to feel rich
Them niggas who snaked, I kept it real with it
And they ain't loyal though
Mind of a psycho twelve posted on light poles
Soul cracked to the light though
Going crazy I might though
RIP who I cry to
Hold my head on cause I got to
Yeah, I'm loyal nigga

[Hook]
