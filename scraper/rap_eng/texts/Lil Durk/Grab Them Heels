[Intro:]
What’s up, honey?
Look, I got a roof for us tonight
Just go ahead and search the info for the hotel and all that
Just make sure you wear them heels that I like, right?
Get in tune, stupid!

[Hook: John Blu]
I like it when you’re on top (on top, on top)
I like how you scream out, “don’t stop!” (don’t stop, don’t stop)
The way you put it down
Got it stuck up like you robbin' it, robbin' it, robbin' it
I like it when you grab them heels, grab them heels
I like it when you grab them heels, grab them heels
The way you put it down
Got it stuck up like you robbin' it, robbin' it, robbin' it


[Verse 1: John Blu]
Girl, my body pouting, pick up!
They gonna take this beat, speak up!
Wear them heels and them meds
Put that trench on your back
Put that MAC on them lips
Bring them cuffs, bring that whip
Stretch him out of his bed (go girl!)
Cause I’m gonna go all in (go girl!)
Just call me Jason, cause I’m stabbing it
I’m gonna put my back in it
You gonna grab them heels while I’m on top of you

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Lil Durk]
Girl just hush your mouth
When your man not around
I don't wanna hear no sound
I'mma lay you down, undress you with my eyes
Lick all on your neck
Can’t explain your feelings, can't explain your sex!
I like when you’re on top, keep your heels on babe
I do want that top, need that feeling, babe
Every main girl need a man, to drive him crazy
So count on me, so count on me!
Red bottoms match your lipsticks
Red bone, what you mixed with?
Trying to get you to business
Just be in my business
OK, who your friends is?
All I need is a misses
All I need your sexing
Your touching, your kissing

[Verse 3: John Blu]
Girl is on tonight
Cause I can’t see myself laying alone tonight
I got so much in mind that I want to try
You gonna be my test dummy
You gonna feel me in your stomach
Pin them legs, ain’t no running, girl!
Grab them heels, bite that lip
Girl, you’re such a perfect fit
I love the way you’re working it, uh!
I just want to make love
Hit it like we’re making love
Tonight we gonna like it when you’re on top, on top, on top
I like the way you scream out, don’t stop (don’t stop, uh)
The way you put it down
Got it stuck up like you’re robbing it, robbing it!

I like it when you grab them heels, grab them heels
The way you put it down
Got it stuck up like you’re robbing it, robbing it!
