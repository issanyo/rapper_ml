[Verse 1]
Body bag, body bag
Foe'nem, they don chopped his ass
No parole, but the pole I got, they done dropped his ass
No toll, headshot, gave his whole top a tag
Drama act, in da cut were llamas at, copy cat
Coppas on my ass and shit, ain't do it , innocent
Niggas know my resume, 30 poppa Bebe kid
You don't know who Bay Bay is 4 six, Woodlawn
OTF the family, even my barber tapin' shit
Uzi spit, got a deal
Coolin with my movie bitch
Movie clip, for a op nigga or a goofy bitch
Get head from my groupie bitch
You wifin hoes, you losin' it
Thinkin' you aluminum, you would get stretched, bag, homicide
Police said my baby shy
Sup 'Lo, before your ass was born I saved a 100 thou
Daddy on his savage shit, you know that boy be wildin out
You know I bring savage out
Lurkin like, why they hidin out
Drama life, but my whole family told me to calm it down
Bro and them gotta be bonding out
Me and my bitch we bonding now
No cass, but that mac I got that bitch work condom style
I spit crack like Bobby Brown
They know I'm a problem child
Wifin, we don't do that shit, that shit be trifling
Cause the same bitch that eat the clit, like she dyking
Lovin hoes, but the same bitch we put the pipe in
She sucking dick, the same bitch you give goodnight kiss
Sucka, yo ass a sucka, Superman
If I can't make you dance I bet that uzi can
Backflip, if you front your move when that mac spit
All I know is drill, drill, drill on my Pac shit

[Interlude]

[Verse 2]
My shootas gonna shoot some shit
Ruthless shit cause we do this shit

Droppin shit, we go through some shit
Red light, red tape, caught a couple Ls on some goofy shit
Goofy niggas claiming shit, niggas ain't even do this shit

Body count with the opps we on the top cause we stay in the lead

You betta at tennessee, I ain't talking Tennessee

Masked up like I'm Dracula, mobbin shit, no Gucci Mane, niggas know that we cashin' up
Twister with the blicky it's black and it spins fast as fuck
Niggas rapped a life time, who'd eva thought I'd pass em' up
