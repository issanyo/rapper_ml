[Hook]
Everyday I spend my last and I count up a check
Then I gotta go and get it
I lay my niggas to rest and you know whose next
10 toes, ain't no sittin'
How is you tryna finesse?
Can't finesse a finesser, the hustlers know it best
Gave the right niggas money, they say I'm a mess, no stress
I'ma count me a check
I'ma count me a check
I'ma count me a check
I'ma count me a check, check, check
See you can't finesse a finesser
See I don't be with nothin extra
See you can't finesse a finesser
Count me a check
I'm just countin' me a check

[Verse 1]
Roll up in an Audi, no lottery but we scratchin' shit
Six Tecs for the drop but usually we sippin' Actavis
Dope boy music, them niggas gon' want to trap to this
Macaroni my bag of homies so ain't no lackin' shit
30 for the Rolex cool, 20 for the cross too
Been there when nobody was there, it was dark too
Keep me protected from the streets, I got a cross too
And if you cross me then I cross you
Ran off on the plug twice and I know they searchin'
If I got to say that shit twice then you know I'm merchin'
His and hers Rollies get them shiny looking like the ocean
Get on top of me baby and get to surfin'
Like a surfboard
Sippin' on this lean got me paranoid
Gotta get this green so help me Lord
So why you with that hater shit?
Can't fuck with a basic bitch
I'ma tell 'em them lies

[Hook]
Everyday I spend my last and I count up a check
Then I gotta go and get it
I lay my niggas to rest and you know whose next
10 toes, ain't no sittin'
How is you tryna finesse?
Can't finesse a finesser, the hustlers know it best
Gave the right niggas money, they say I'm a mess, no stress
I'ma count me a check
I'ma count me a check
I'ma count me a check
I'ma count me a check, check, check
See you can't finesse a finesser
See I don't be with another X
See you can't finesse a finesser
Count me a check
I'm just countin' me a check

[Verse 2]
Money is the motto, these bitches don't wanna swallow it
Bitches want the fame, all they want me to do is follow them
She just gon' bring me drank cause she a pharmacist
Play my new single at the station cause I ain't callin' in
Niggas in the city wanna kill me, I ain't part of them
My niggas got 50 shot clips, they like barbers then
She can ride my 'Rari then cause she look like a Barbie bitch
If I catch her stealin' we all at her head like bobby pins
I'ma get this money till I d-i-e
Bring bottles to my session, to my VIP
I like my bitch's vest, let me see ID
Gettin' all this money like Lord why me
Gang in this bitch
100 dollar bills changed in this bitch
Got the Rollies and the chains in this bitch
We gon' shoot us somethin' strange in this bitch
Cause I count me up a check
