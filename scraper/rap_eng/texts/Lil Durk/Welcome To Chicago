[Intro: DJ Pharris]
C-H-I C-A-G-O AKA the 'Go
Ask your friend about the city of wind
Might lose your next of kin
Niggas rapping to get off the blocks
Cause this shit done got way too hot
Too much hate done raised the murder rate
When one move can seal your fate
Shawties can’t even move around
Cause niggas won’t put the guns down
