Nigga hoes always talking pillow niggas
Got some hittas runnin up that'll hit a nigga
You ain't real, you ain't never been a drilling nigga
Fuck the team nigga, I got my gang
You a ho nigga, I got your chain
Six shots if you mention my name
The opps do it cuz the police the same
These niggas giving out special things
Pour it up slow it down for the lean heads
All these niggas around me, they don't mean shit
50/50 for a check you ain't bring shit
War time back to back you ain't seen shit
L's up, free the guys, we the team bitch
OTF, 300, we the team bitch
Ray Charles on the block, ain't seen shit
