[Verse 1: Doe Boy]
Pull up, thirty-four, thirty, know a young nigga scorin'
Introduce her to the real 'cause her last man was borin'
Do the dash in the coupe, blowin' gas out the roof
Inhale all smoke, exhale out the truth
From the man to the heart's where a young nigga shoot
Niggas dyin' for them headshots, fuck a bulletproof
I was flexin' forty-five so I copped out for four
Just let a nigga home, 'cause they couldn't get more

[Chorus: Doe Boy]
Don't you lie, don't you lie, don't you lie on me
I just came home from three, do the rest on probation
Fill my double cup, that Activis my motivation
Fill my double cup, that Activis my medication

[Verse 2: Doe Boy]
Dropped out first day, and I'm Louboutins
Kissed my son and told him love him and I'll never leave again
Pockets filled all the way up with them blue benjamins
Pockets 'bout to bust open with them blue benjamins
Jumped in the 'Rari, ninety all the way home
With this bad lil foreign, tryna see what she on
I'm a bossed up nigga with a bossed up bitch
With a bossed up clique, RBMG the shit
Don't you know we 'bout that stick talk, we'll make it happen
I bust down the Rollies, got all my niggas matchin'
Then I'm swervin' in that fast lane, can catch me in traffic
Yeah, I'm swervin' in that fast lane, can catch me in traffic
Don't you lie, don't you lie, don't you lie on me
Niggas say I ain't in it like the player bring static
Ballin' like LeBron, it's crazy how my Scottie Pippen missin'
Screamin' free lil brodie Cray 'cause my Scottie Pippen missin'
They want us to fall off, tell them niggas keep wishin'
Told her shawty don't switch, ain't a winner, you ain't winnin'
Told her baby you can have the world and everything in it
Told her baby you can have the world and everything in it

[Chorus: Doe Boy]
Don't you lie, don't you lie, don't you lie with me
Girl, you fuckin' with the realest
Girl, you fuckin' with realest, yeah
Girl, you fuckin' with the realest, yeah
I said, you fuckin' with the realest, yeah
(I just came home from three, do the rest on probation
Fill my double cup, that Activis my motivation
Fill my double cup, that Activis my medication)

[Verse 3: Lil Durk]
When they freed Doe Boy, he pulled up in a Rolls Royce
Gave him a chopper on parole, ain't had no choice (grrrr)
Gotta get this money, I'm told can't be no broke boy
And I left my ex bitch 'cause she want a broke boy
I was sippin' lean before I knew what a four was (yeah, yeah)
I ain't talkin' to the Queen, but she need a soldier
She was with me, with me, with me when I was Coke Boy
First time really seen her, I had to go for it
Mmh-mmh-mmh, I don't want to cheat on you
Mmh-mmh-mmh, you can hear my cup beep
Mmh-mmh-mmh, shawty, she a bad bitch
Uh-uh-uh, shawty suck a C tick
Give me your wrist so I can Patek it
If I give you my heart, baby,protect that
It's like our hearts WiFi, we connected
And I love walkin' in, seein' you naked
Like Fetty Wap with me, drinkin' 1738
Thirty thou, navigate to the Birkin place
I in't seen you in a while, and you're beautiful (turn up)
I been sippin' on that drank, I feel I'm losin' you
You spinnin' me in circles like a hula hoop
I ain't give up on you
No what I'm sayin', you real solid, know what I'm sayin'
First place, shawty know she got first place

[Outro: Doe Boy]
Don't you lie, don't you lie, don't you lie with me
Don't you lie, don't you lie, don't you lie with me
Don't you lie, don't you lie, don't you lie with me
Don't you lie, don't you lie, don't you lie with me
Yeah yeah yeah
