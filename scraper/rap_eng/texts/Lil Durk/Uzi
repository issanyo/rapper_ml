[Intro: Lil Durk]
That pussy bustin’ like a
That pussy bustin’ like a uzi
Pussy bustin’ like a

[Chorus: Lil Durk]
I done fell in love with all the groupies
She just want the fame and all the moolah
I’m addicted to the tattoos on her booty
And if she fuck with me then she ain’t losing
That pussy bustin’ like a uzi
That pussy bustin’ like a
That pussy bustin’ like a uzi
That pussy bustin’ like a
That pussy bustin’ like a
That pussy bustin’ like a uzi

[Verse 1: Lil Durk]
Wake up, roll up a decker
Rubbing on her nipples while we steady kissing
Even after sex that pussy steady dripping
I told her I’d be fuckin’ but she something different
She like I’m cocky to riches I’m ignorant
Always mind her business, don’t put two cent in it
Dress her in Dior and tell her mind her business
I take her on a trip and pay for all expenses
I don’t got no type, I like all hoes
Even in the hood with some dog hoes
But them be them bitches we don’t fall for
Talking down bitch, the one that we can call on
Like bring me the work, shawty bring me the pack
Like bring me the lean, shawty bring me the strap
Her ass is like promoters how she bring it back
She’ll drop [?] before she ever [?] with that

[Chorus: Lil Durk]
I done fell in love with all the groupies
She just want the fame and all the moolah
I’m addicted to the tattoos on her booty
And if she fuck with me then she ain’t losing
That pussy bustin’ like a uzi
That pussy bustin’ like a
That pussy bustin’ like a uzi
That pussy bustin’ like a
That pussy bustin’ like a
That pussy bustin’ like a uzi

[Verse 2: Moneybagg Yo]
Yeah, every time we link we make a movie
I just fucked your bitch in a Jacuzzi
She hop on top and ride like a Suzuki
She squirt, that pussy bustin’ like a tooly
She say she love me, bitch you gotta prove it
I’m driving while she suck me like a smoothie
You was just a groupie with a juicy booty
And I’m just thirsty
You got the type of sex to make me leave my bitch
But is you worth it?
Nah, nah nah, I was just full of them perkys
You on the dick like you surfing
Love how you twerk it, love how you work it
You want a man that’s holding your hand but I’m not that person
I’m just the type that’s gon come through, fuck, and buy you some purses
She just want the fame, she love my lifestyle
She just want her neck, wrist, and ears iced out
I done fell in love with one of my fans
She eat me for hours on them xans

[Chorus: Lil Durk]
I done fell in love with all the groupies
She just want the fame and all the moolah
I’m addicted to the tattoos on her booty
And if she fuck with me then she ain’t losing
That pussy bustin’ like a uzi
That pussy bustin’ like a
That pussy bustin’ like a uzi
That pussy bustin’ like a
That pussy bustin’ like a
That pussy bustin’ like a uzi
