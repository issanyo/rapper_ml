[Hook: Hypno Carlito]
All night sippin' lean and crackin' bars back to back
Me and Durk in Cali coppin' cars back to back
Sayin' she a spaceship that's some stars back to back
Bro done rolled the loud, I'm crackin' Woods back to back
I just fucked your bitch and I just fucked her back to back
Copped designer kitchen, I don't where I am back to back
We be in the club, we're poppin' bottles back to back
So let DJ turn it up and play it back to back

[Verse 1: Lil Durk]
Shawty, I am a liar
Come suck on this pacifier
Rollie was 30 thousand
I'm shootin', I'm tired of fightin'
My bitches be A1, A1
And I fucked this bitch and I ain't say nothin'
Givenchy hood, no Trayvon
Nighttime ride X6
I8 for the daytime
Gettin' this money for all these years
Money longer, feedin' all the kids
52 hundred for the Cartier
Clip longer than barber chairs
Elevated to the master room
Who the fuck walkin' up the stairs?
A white trip, Pearl Harbor, yeah
Shawty toppin' like [?]
Gucci home, got some Gucci tips
Killers hoppin' out the Uber van
All black like an Uber man
Niggas hoeing me to sue and shit
Hot bitches like suing shit
Niggas talkin' 'bout we the gang, gang, gang
We ain't overdoin' shit

[Hook: Hypno Carlito]
All night sippin' lean and crackin' bars back to back
Me and Durk in Cali coppin' cars back to back
Sayin' she a spaceship that's some stars back to back
Bro done rolled the loud, I'm crackin' Woods back to back
I just fucked your bitch and I just fucked her back to back
Copped designer kitchen, I don't where I am back to back
We be in the club, we're poppin' bottles back to back
So let DJ turn it up and play it back to back

[Verse 2: Hypno Carlito]
Bro done rolled the loud and got me so high back to back
We ain't got no money extra, hold that back to back
Fuckin' her back to back
Hypno Carlito get back to that
Fuckin' wives, she got a man today
A lot of diamonds, yeah, we havin' that
I stay in designer, niggas be lyin'
Rappin' 'bout money that they ain't got
It's all 'bout timin', fuck a consignment
No, we're not friends, no doubtin' that
I'm OTF, yeah, it's gang, gang
Your bitch wanna meet the gang, gang
Introduce her to a gang bang
He'll be mad that's his main thing
Shooters cost a few thou'
Got the tool out, move the fuck around

Same niggas, no new crowds
Old friends gettin' to it now
Bitch, I'm poppin' don't do me now
Niggas better cool out
