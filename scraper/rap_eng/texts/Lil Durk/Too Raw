[Hook]
This my car, hop in bitch and take yo' shoes off
Beggin' bitch she keep on askin' me throw my mood off
I got prices goin' to the store and bring me 2 pops
I can't fuck that pussy that pussy weak that pussy too popped
My little whoadie changed the score that nigga too hot
I can't trust my homie 'cause he told he too cop
Fresh out of jail fresh out of jail judge gave me 2 shots
And I told the judge that I'm too raw

[Verse]
Bandana on me like I'm 2pac
Shoutout to Rome I call him 2 Glocks
Don't mention names to get some cool points
That's that shit that's gon' get you shot
Bankroll, two knots
Dope boy, two spots
Hot stove, two pots
Dior, no Guwop
Audemar wristwatch, broke hoes, don't kiss thots
Fuck a rumor, send shots
Next day, 10 shots
Shake something, my lil niggas gon' take somethin'
Me and Randy fucked your baby mama
A nigga like me you can't pay to argue
Beverly Hills, don't pay for parking
Been in the trenches, got top dollar
With my dogs like Rottweilers
Me and my dawgs, we ain't got problems

[Hook]
This my car, hop in bitch and take yo' shoes off
Beggin' bitch she keep on askin' me throw my mood off

My little whoadie changed the score that nigga too hot
I can't trust my homie 'cause he told he too cop
Fresh out of jail fresh out of jail judge gave me 2 shots
And I told the judge that I'm too raw
