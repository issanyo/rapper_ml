How could you snitch on me
How could you played with me
I thought we were blood brothers
You did me so dirty, you snitch and lied on me
How can i trust you, we were at the casino
2 man got shot so we left the scene
How could you take everything i gave you and you  betrayed on me
There were 2 murder scene on ave bloc , i got keep this hot
Are we not gonna eat, the d e a question me, but i'm never snitching on a soul no not me
We were running from choppers and helicops
