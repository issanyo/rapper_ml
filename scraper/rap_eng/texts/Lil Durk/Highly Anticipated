[Intro]
They say I'm highly anticipated, uh
Everyday life
They say I'm highly anticipated, uh
They say I'm highly anticipated, uh

[Verse 1: Dave East & (Lil Durk)]
They say I'm highly anticipated
She boujee, she highly sophisticated
Jump on a highway, we rental plated
Them niggas ain't riding, they giving statements
Bust down my watch, diamonds in the face
I got haters proud to say I made it (proud)
I got the loud, I'm in a spaceship (loud)
Them niggas ain't wild that's entertainment
I broke down a pound down in the basement
I don't got time to take a photo (yeah, yeah)
Pistol loaded, bitch I'm yelling yolo
Niggas out here telling I was selling dolo
I ain't not no motherfucking role model (role model)
They put my face on a gold bottle
You won't throw hollows, you want no problems
You wan't no smoke, nigga, don't bother (ah)
Herbo want Tia or Tamera or somethin' (ooh)
They don't pay up, then we airin' somethin' (grah)
I might collab with Moncler or somethin'
Like my bitch is naked wearin' nothin' (wearin' nothin')
She ain't mine, we can share somethin' (share somethin')
You actin' like you can't hear or somethin' (hear or somethin')
I be talking to the mirror tryin' to see it clear
'Nother a half a million coming (ugh)
She on my dick, that's a kill coming
Fuck the opps, they ain't killed nothing
I was lean drinkin', I was pill dumping
How your ass fake and you a real woman?
I was out grinding, for real popping (for real)
For Halloween, we was still pumping
Shooter acting like a barber now
When the spot packed, niggas still cutting

[Verse 2: Lil Durk & (Dave East)]
Ooh, woah, I put my heart and my soul in this (heart and soul)
'Cause I be riding with the gangsters
Why the system tryna control my shit? (I don't know)
They only doing it 'cause I'm famous (famous nigga)
Grew my dreads back, fuck the wave grease
Who would've thought I'd be right here right now with Dave East? (Durkio)
I'm with the robbers, with the scammers on the daily (my niggas)
And I be smiling at the niggas who done played me, yeah, yeah ( fuck 'em)
You don't know, I came from nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing
You don't know (you don't know, nigga)
You don't know, I came from hustling, hustling, hustling ( hustle)
Can't no old head mislead me (nah)
Had to leave my old bitch 'cause that bitch greedy
I tried to go and clean my image, tried to feed the needy
And I told all of my guys, they back, can't make a nigga bleed me, yeah, yeah
I can't keep no secret, I fucked a famous hoe (me too)
I ain't trick off, she tricked off on me, I saved the hoe
And I fucked his baby mama with the plainest clothes
I ain't want no Patek, ain't want no Rollie, then the trenches ghost
Highly anticipated, highly anticipated
Highly anticipated, highly anticipated
This for ya'll who waited

[Outro: Dave East]
