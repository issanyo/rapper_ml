[Intro]
Oh Lord, Oh Lord
Forgive Me Father,Forgive Me Father

[Hook]
Oh Lord, I did that dirt
Forgive Me Lord, I put in work
I payed my dues, I made life worth it
Before this rap shit, I made [?] count first
Oh Lord, Forgive Me Father
Oh Lord, Forgive Me Father

[Verse 1]
Forgive me for my sins, the judge off a ten
The police lyin', I wasn't in that van
But where im from, they want us in that system dead
I payed lawyer fees, I paid for bro'nem Funeral
I had it so, so tell me what you would do
Alot of niggas acting real, but they fugazy
Real niggas never fold like a suitcase
Niggas tellin' statements all in that suitcase
It hurt to tell who talking like a two face
Nowadays you never know, who fake
But real in my blood its in my bloodline
But niggas hatin' on me, wish I won't shine
But I'm out their league, I'm too hot
Birds of a feather, im too fly
Same niggas with me everyday I ain't lie
Niggas wanna knock me off but it ain't Time

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Whoever sayin' real, dont lie
They talkin' guns, they won't fight me
Checker bag, I'm talkin' Nike
Niggas seen me
I'm a different breed, you can tell
Niggas pray for my downfall, I wish em well
You wifin' thots, ima kiss and tell
Niggas can't make bail
But I can see who real to me
Only real niggas feelin me
Ray charles can see
My guns drawn, it's yall to me
They tweet me if im good,call and see
I check up on my niggas, daily
What I do wrong for them to hate me?
You can see me clip, hd

[Hook]
