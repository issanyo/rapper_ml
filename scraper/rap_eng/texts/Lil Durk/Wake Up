[Hook 1: Healthy Chill]
I just be gettin' the money

[Verse 1: Healthy Chill]
I just wake up and get money
I've been with the shits since a yungin'
I dare a nigga play 'bout my money
Them zones on yo' ass they be gunnin'
Keep a shoota wit me, no junkin'
My niggas real right, they 100
Red dot, man down, man down, put you in ya boot, you thought I was bluffing
I remember them days I was broke
No bucks, man the money was slow
I remember them days I was broke
Them bitches not in, never spoke
Now a nigga trap off his phone
Now a nigga rap and do shows
Never goin' back to being broke
Before that, I kick in yo door
I go to sleep thinkin' 'bout money
I wake up thinkin' 'bout money
I fuck a bitch thinkin' 'bout money
Can't chase a bitch, I'm chasin' 100s
Left to the game, that's the movement
Catch a lick then I'm flexin' like (?)
I just be gettin' the money
I just wake up and get money

[Hook 2: Healthy Chill & Lil Durk]
I just wake up and get money (Gang!)
I just wake up to the money (yea baby)

[Verse 2: Lil Durk & Healthy Chill]
Wake up in the mornin'
Get the money, hop in a foreign
Don't fuck wit one bitch 'cause they borin'
I just made 200 off tourin'
These bitches be on me, I get it in
I'mma shoot the shit out of Zimmerman
These bitches be bad, she send her man
Uh, she send her man
Like shoutout my jeweler
Like shoutout Lil Verty the shooter, my niggas get money, keep rugers
I bet y'all want head like a tutor
Broke ass boy got ya broke jeans
Mix my sprite wit codeine
Dead presidents, no 14
I'm just all about the benjamins baby
See, look at diamonds they shinin'
Rollie on me, perfect timin'
I feel like Jay Z, I might buy her a island
Might suck on that pussy, it ain't got no mileage
My niggas is savage, we pull up and damage
We gon' (?), pull up my niggas gon' win
Momma the rari look old, buy you a new house and new rims, yea yeaa

[Hook 2: Healthy Chill]

[Verse 3: Healthy Chill]
The hottest young nigga in my city
I swear all these niggas ain't fuckin' wit me
'Cause I've seen, I mean it, I'd do it
If I pull it, I'll mean it I'll shoot it
All you niggas dumb, all you stupid
Got demons (?)
They I couldn't do it, watch me do it
Everybody eat, that's how we movin'
Middle finger up to these niggas
I can't trust none of these niggas
I go to war wit my niggas
Pull out (?) wit my niggas

Get too much for my niggas
Check out (?) for my niggas
Send him through for my niggas
I ain't time for no fuck shit
I ain't time for no bitch
Nigga young nigga just tryna get rich
Put up two (?) hate that's a threat

Where I'm from, I get respect wit the set
Get to a check, wit my niggas
Healthy mob, we them niggas, gang!

Momma the rari look old, buy you a new house and new rims, yea yeaa
