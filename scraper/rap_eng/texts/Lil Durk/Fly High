[Intro: Sample]
Taking it slow, feeding my flame
Shuffling the cards of your game
And just in time, in the right place
Suddenly I will play my ace

[Chorus: French Montana]
Said it's money on our side, niggas talking 5 shots
Niggas talking fire hot
It's money on our side, niggas talking 5 shots
Said it's money on our side, niggas talking 5 shots
Niggas talking fire hot
To the top we're flying high
Flying high, flying high, flying high

[Verse 1: Lil Durk]
I did two on my first case, next case 21, the worst case
I was 21 when I really sing the birthday
I know niggas die before they seen they 10th birthday
Niggas talk to me about fire
Told my niggas I'd be rich they called me liar
And now they buyin' fame but get burnt playing with this lighter
I come through late nights with this 40 and bright they night up
They grabbed NumbaNine for a homicide
Left me traumatized, now I'm screamin' fuck the other side
Rider, grab the glizzy, I'mma slide 'em
Fuck all these rumors, I keep my pride on [?]

[Chorus: French Montana]
Said it's money on our side, niggas talking 5 shots
Niggas talking fire hot
It's money on our side, niggas talking 5 shots
Said it's money on our side, niggas talking 5 shots
Niggas talking fire hot
To the top we're flying high
Flying high, flying high, flying high

[Verse 2: French Montana]
Got a million when I bought a Ghost
I don't date, I rather play the joke
In that European riding with a burner
If a nigga run up on me I'mma burn him
Nigga make me love it first
Nowhere to turn when niggas turn up
100 racks, bought 'em on the flyer
100 clip, don't play with that fire
They caught Max for the seven five
Left me traumatized, fuck the other side
Chiraq, Southside with Durk
Coke boy nigga till the dirt

[Chorus: French Montana]
Said it's money on our side, niggas talking 5 shots
Niggas talking fire hot
It's money on our side, niggas talking 5 shots
Said it's money on our side, niggas talking 5 shots
Niggas talking fire hot
To the top we're flying high
Flying high, flying high, flying high
