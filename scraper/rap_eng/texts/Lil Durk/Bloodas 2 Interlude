[Verse 1: Tee Grizzley]
I'm just curious, niggas can't be serious
Woke up like, "What year is it?" Niggas on their period
My change done gave me somethin', it ain't no curin' it
I seen Durk, I heard up close, bitch ain't no fear in it

[Verse 2: Lil Durk]
My name superior
Bro and 'em be trappin'
They throwin' a couple hundreds just so you can deliver it
You said if he robbed you that you was gon' kill him
I seen him today, I'm just curious
I told her don't put me on child support, I'ma give extra but she wasn't hearin' it
I take you around the killer, the robbers, the shooters just for the experience

[Verse 3: Tee Grizzley]
Don't try to dodge you, make up yo bed, you lay in it, niggas ain't hearin' it
I get yo bitch in the Bentley, she gon' see some shit she never experienced
I am a Captain, I get you crunched and put in box, no cereal
This automatic hit that whip, nothing gon' help niggas short of a miracle

[Verse 4: Lil Durk]
Tryna to make a million off a Bloodas tour but his P.O. not clearin' him
Tryna make a M and M but he couldn't do it and that shit was killin' him
And I grew up in the ghettos, I ain't never hung around gentlemen
Bought the drugs, take the drugs, niggas in the hood ain't really tryna get it
You would be surprised what your brothers do (uh)
Don't be surprised for this Bloodas 2 (uh)
Couldn't feel my face when I popped that ecstasy
Couldn't feel my face off percs, I just took 3

[Verse 5: Tee Grizzley & Lil Durk & Both]
And my lil' bro could've died next to me (aye)
But I shot first, get him a stretcher please (aye)
Them chopsticks got his body ten degrees (aye)
Someone should've told him we part Japanese (aye)
Bro by the mill, he tryna catch the weed (aye)
This bitch tryna get me to invest in weave (aye)
I told her, "Yes," just to finesse that freak (aye)
After I fuck, I'm playin' hide and go seek

[Verse 6: Lil Durk]
I done been through so much shit in my life
I be askin', "When the pain stop?"
Used to ride to school, Mongoose, now in a Range drop (skrt skrt)
Is you is who you say you is?
You can't be who you is, you play with Grizz'

[Verse 7: Tee Grizzley]
You play with Durkio, you pick out your box
I'm good on my block, good on O-Block (aye)
They in they feelings 'cause I smoke on opps (aye)
I hope they know 100 shots gon' stop
I just been tryna save it, they keep on makin' it hard
They keep on makin' us jewelry, they keep on makin' these cars
That pump hit him, it's gon' lift him up and that nigga gon' make it to Mars
On track to confirm that shipment should make it tomorrow

[Verse 8: Lil Durk]
50 to 100 stacks on yo head, I bet you won't make it tomorrow
Let me know your crib all night, no sleep, they drinkin' Starbucks
I'm talkin' boss life, you say my name one time, I'ma tell 'em I fucked your boss wife
I nut on her teeth, she wipe her face, I wore my Off-White
I forgave you but that love made me (love made me)
I popped some ecstasy that Thug gave me
Shout-out that new opp pack, my brothers made it
Don't play with them boys 'cause they over crazy
