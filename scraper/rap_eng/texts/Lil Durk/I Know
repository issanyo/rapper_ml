[Intro]
DJ on the beat so it's a banger

[Chorus]
I know one nigga, he started a war but he don't want no parts
I know one nigga'll snake his family 'cause he ain't got no heart
I know one nigga who'll come out a Cut' just 'cause he ain't have no car
I know one nigga who'll sniff a perc just 'cause he ain't got no bars
I know one nigga told me stop singin', told me put out them bars
Why would I do that and that's one main reason I got these cars?
Nowadays crazy
They'll make you feel bad if you ain't got no job
Nowadays crazy
They don't teach you 'bout school, they'll teach you how to rob
Yeah, turn up
We ain't goin' back to be broke no more
You my bro, we ain't goin' back and forth 'bout a ho
How you say you fam but you don't show no love?
How you say you fam but you don't show no love?

[Post-Chorus]
Only The Family, I went to jail and I plead for insanity
I stay with my family, they wasn't around, thought they abandoned me
Do they love us like they say they do?
Do they love me like they say they do? (Do they love me like they say they do?)

[Verse 1]
I went to jail and met Muslims, reason I don't eat swine
Ain't talked to my son in a minute, my mama had told me fine
My cousin had went to the feds and told me that he took his time
I lost my mind, I thought I was trippin', they told me that he dropped a dime, damn
Granny still holdin' up, sometimes she'll lose her mind
Had to catch myself sayin', "Remember?", damn well she don't remember '09
I threatened my homies, know damn well I'm lyin'
Don't switch your story, you know them niggas told on Nine
Can't hang with the mice
So high, I done came in her twice
Know a bitch suck dick for the munch
And I'm so legit with the ice
Drug dealer, no family price
I stopped drinkin' lean with the ice
G-Wagon, I lean to the right
I move like a thief in the night
Some niggas don't use they pipes
Stop playin', you'll lose your life
Some niggas ain't cool with a slice
Four-five with a drum, they slide
When they slide, you hide
You get caught, that's pride
'Cause you ain't gon' tell that story
'Cause you know you dyin'

[Chorus]
I know one nigga, he started a war but he don't want no parts
I know one nigga'll snake his family 'cause he ain't got no heart
I know one nigga who'll come out a Cut' just 'cause he ain't have no car
I know one nigga who'll sniff a perc just 'cause he ain't got no bars
I know one nigga told me stop singin', told me put out them bars
Why would I do that and that's one main reason I got these cars?
Nowadays crazy
They'll make you feel bad if you ain't got no job
Nowadays crazy
They don't teach you 'bout school, they'll teach you how to rob
Yeah, turn up
We ain't goin' back to be broke no more
You my bro, we ain't goin' back and forth 'bout a ho
How you say you fam but you don't show no love?
How you say you fam but you don't show no love?

[Post-Chorus]
Only The Family, I went to jail and I plead for insanity
I stay with my family, they wasn't around, thought they abandoned me
Do they love us like they say they do?
Do they love me like they say they do? (Do they love me like they say they do?)

[Verse 2]
Keepin' it real is the recipe
I let the streets get the best of me
Drug dealers tried to invest in me
I know some people in desperate needs
Gang hungry, I invest in we
Stayed in a home with no type of heat
9 to 5, I had checks a week
My big bro had a block of cheese
My shorty slide in SRT's
Four-five Glock with extended wings
They gon' slide when they off them beans
I ain't gon' lie, I can't be no meme
I still cry when I talk to OG
I see him dead, that shit OC
Two hundred grams and I send 'em OT
Gotta watch niggas, they be police
Rest in peace to Fredo, kill that lean
A day with Booka in the trench is Halloween
They know that we 'bout it
I know some niggas that doubt it, B
Run up on me, boy I doubt it
Who the fuck say that you family?

[Chorus]
I know one nigga, he started a war but he don't want no parts
I know one nigga'll snake his family 'cause he ain't got no heart
I know one nigga who'll come out a Cut' just 'cause he ain't have no car
I know one nigga who'll sniff a perc just 'cause he ain't got no bars
I know one nigga told me stop singin', told me put out them bars
Why would I do that and that's one main reason I got these cars?
Nowadays crazy
They'll make you feel bad if you ain't got no job
Nowadays crazy
They don't teach you 'bout school, they'll teach you how to rob
Yeah, turn up
We ain't goin' back to be broke no more
You my bro, we ain't goin' back and forth 'bout a ho
How you say you fam but you don't show no love?
How you say you fam but you don't show no love?

[Outro]
Don't want to be broke
Back and forth 'bout a ho
You don't show no love
Family
