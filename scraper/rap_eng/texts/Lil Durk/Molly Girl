[Hook: Lil Durk]
I'm in Molly World, I need a molly girl
Pineapple swirl keep me in Molly World
Bite down because I'm bussin', feel on top of the world
I'm out here off a molly I need a molly girl
I'm in Molly World, I'm in Molly World
Bitch I'm out here bussin', I need a molly girl
I'm in Molly World, I'm in Molly World
Bitch I'm off the shits, I need a molly girl

[Verse 1: Lil Durk]
Bitch I need a molly, I'm off one in the party
I just copped me a 'Rari, I'm global like safari
Your bitch she need a molly, she ride me like a Harley
My chopper like a Harley, O.T.F. we in the party
Yeah bitch, I'm rolling , all my bottles golden
Got her in her zone, and take one, ain't no folding
My dick that bitch be holding, all this money throwing
All this money throwing, all this money throwing
Bitch I'm 'bout that life. off one ain't no sleep
Bitch you must be scared, off a whole, fuck a piece
Bitch I'm in the streets, fuck nigga don't want no beef
300 that's the team, 300 that's the team

[Verse 2: Lil Durk]
Molly girl my supermodel, I don't loan my Gucci goggles
Pop one in my 'Rari riding, True Religion my true religion
Foreign car, my roof missing, white on white, I'm a fool with it
White on white, I'm a fool with it, that spotlight I'mma fool with it
I'm out here like everyday, I get money in every way
Went to jail for my petty case, Molly World that's a better place
L's up in my haters' face, I'm energized like Gatorade
Cooking shit like Rachael Ray, O.T.F. 'til the day I grave
Bitch I'm out here rolling, all these bitches going
Kush too strong, that potent, she wetter than the ocean
Molly got her in motion, that lean is what I'm pouring
Molly, where we going? That molly where we going
