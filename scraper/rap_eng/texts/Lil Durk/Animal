[Verse 1]
I be on my animal, I'm trained with the pipe
You know niggas, they be acting, they ain't made for this life
Niggas bitches, they be tricking, gave my main nigga life
I can't tell, on my baby, I can't give 'em no advice
Mouth duct taped, cause I can't snitch, O.T.F. we in this bitch
We was broke and now we rich, got me feeling like I'm Mitch
Niggas tripping, ain't gon' lie
I've been hustling all my life
I've been rapping all my life
Drop my van's, I'm the man
Free Lil Law , and free Lil Jam
Get my hitters out the jail
I spend money on the ground
So you know I got that work
Niggas talking, my name Durk
True Religion's and a shirt
Got a Mac, ?
Ain't no talking cause I told you

[Hook]
I'm a animal
I got my chopper in the trunk and I'mma damage you
I got my niggas in the cut, and they punish you
I got my shooters with the scope, and they aim at you
Cause we some animals
And I'm a animal
I got the chopper in the trunk, and I'mma damage you
I got my niggas in the cut, and they punish you
I got my shooters with the scope, and they aim at you
Cause I'm a animal, cause I'm a animal

[Verse 2]
All my life I do me, I'm riding and I'm totting
What I'm smoking is potent, I rub her like a Trojan
300, know she going
Yeah, I know she going
And I know she going, like Shady bitch I go in
Fake Forgiato, that shit I don't like
Color truck cream, cause that coka come in all type
Money dancing wicked Louie, we be in it all night
All night, all night
And my wrist barely bright
I be sipping white Remy, I be on my boss shit
All white clothes, today indicted my closet
How you piss I'm the shit, ho's spin like the toilet
40 get your dirty mouth clean, chewing Orbit
I be in the factory, stacks in my Truey'
And my belt Louie, rolling off of Gucci
Bad bitches on me like I hopped up out a movie
All white everything, winning never losing

[Hook]
