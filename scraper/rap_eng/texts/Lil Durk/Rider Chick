[Intro: Lil Durk]
She gon' be 100, hol' that muthafucka down
(?) you how that shit go street nigga
Know what I'm sayin'?

[Chorus: Lil Durk]
She my rider chick, she on the block with these savages
She on point like a guard but she ain’t havin it
We don't go back and forth about private shit
And she be on my block with all the packs and shit
I got a street bitch
I teach her all I know, she a street bitch
She hidin' all my dough, she a street bitch
She gon' go when I say go, she a street bitch

[Verse 1: Lil Durk]
See her friend and shit, I kick her 'round like Pam and shit
And I can't stand that bitch, she tweakin' off them Xans and shit, And I'm the man and shit
A hunnid like them cancers sticks
Street nigga, but I be on some romantic shit
She on snap wit it, I'm from the back wit it
She don't like these rappers, but she be into these trap niggas
Tell me who be all behind my back wit it
In her DM and I'll (?) with him
These niggas hoes, I'll slap niggas
Bought my bitch a Birkin cause she worth it
Told her I be cheating 'cause ain't nobody perfect
She held me down when I was locked up
She was with me in the kitchen when that (?) locked up
She crazy, she a pop up

[Chorus: Lil Durk]
She my rider chick, she on the block with these savages
She on point like a guard but she ain’t havin it
We don't go back and forth about private shit
And she be on my block with all the packs and shit
I got a street bitch
I teach her all I know, she a street bitch
She hidin' all my dough, she a street bitch
She gon' go when I say go, she a street bitch

[Verse 2: Dej Loaf]
I done learned the whole game, he done taught me everythang
Do more, talk less, never say no names
Beat his case like OJ, got him out his old ways
Whippin' work in the kitchen, call that gourmet
Playin' with the pussy pistols, call that foreplay
Fuck him after long days, never leave him horny
Every time he call me, pick up right away
Why the Bentley in the driveway? Always gettin' my way
Bitches be tryin' it, I'm his homie, lover, friend
You can't deny it baby, we thuggin' till the end
Married to the streets, money in the rubber band
Ain't nothin' like the D, I be tuggin' on his pants

[Chorus: Lil Durk]
She my rider chick, she on the block with these savages
She on point like a guard but she ain’t havin it
We don't go back and forth about private shit
And she be on my block with all the packs and shit
I got a street bitch
I teach her all I know, she a street bitch
She hidin' all my dough, she a street bitch
She gon' go when I say go, she a street bitch
