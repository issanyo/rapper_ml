I'm the man in this bitch
I ain't playin' in the bitch
Everybody gotta hate on me

Diamonds dancin' and shit
Everybody gotta hate on me
Like who woulda thought
That I'd make it out the trap
Who woulda thought?
I put my niggas on my back
Who woulda thought?
That I'd flex up and be the man
Who woulda thought?
That I'd stack 100 bands
Yeah yeah

[Verse 1: AMR Freak]
I'm the man in this bitch
100 bands off the shit
Tryna flip it make it rap and get my momma out the shit
Put my niggas on a jet with Audemars and sippin' Act
All 100s in the duffel, foreign cars on the set
Flexed up the youngest boss, Pablo Escobar with war
Drop a kilo on the court and drop a 20 at the (?)
Niggas hatin', steady fakin', but ain't never bossed up
Spent a 100 on this features nigga that's what it cost us
Started knee deep in the trenches, bossed up handlin' business
All 100s handlin' business, down back just reminiscin'
Started knee deep in the trenches, bossed up handlin' business
All 100s handlin' business, down back just reminiscin'
