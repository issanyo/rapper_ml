[Intro: Lil Durk]
I swear to God, know a lot of niggas fu as hell, hear me? And they so real I swear to God on my kids. I'mma let niggas know how I feel about them, you feel me?

[Hook: Lil Durk]
Started with nigga when niggas ain't right
Ran real, lil nigga you ain't right
And I hold my own when I keep my pole
Lil nigga I'm just that type
Where was you at when we starvin' at night?
No place to sleep at night
And you claim you my brother you gettin exposed lil nigga
Nigga you just ain't right
You ain't right lil nigga, I'm see the fake in you
Got plenty of snitches lil nigga ain't nobody making you
Where I'm from in my city lil nigga, it's easy to make the news
You ain't right lil nigga, you ain't right
I know lil niggas ain't right, ain't right

[Verse 1: Lil Herb]
I don't put my trust in a nigga
I don't fuck with niggas, I know they ain't real
150 my niggas, I know they gone kill
Aiming slugs with my niggas we tryna suffer end
No choice but to deal
And for me they gon' ride told me put down the steel
G Herbo get you a deal
The harder you work it's so easy to get to them bills
House on the hills, coupes on some shit on wheels
Herbo I didn't grow up with a butler in LA with my Uncle Phil
No I was out of Chiraq posted up doin' drugs duckin' hollows
I know how they feel
If you ain't front line with your niggas you know you ain't real
They steady keep slidin' on No Limit don't know how to chill
They steady keep slidin' on No Limit don't know how to chill
Lost so many niggas don't know how to feel
You niggas don't know how to feel

[Hook: Lil Durk]
Started with nigga when niggas ain't right
Ran real, lil nigga you ain't right
And I hold my own when I keep my pole
Lil nigga I'm just that tight
Where was you at when we starvin' at night?
No place to sleep at night
And you claim you my brother you getting exposed
Nigga you just ain't right
You ain't right lil nigga, I see the fake in you
Got plenty of snitches lil nigga ain't nobody making you
Where I'm from in my city lil nigga, it's easy to make the news
You ain't right lil nigga, you ain't right
I know lil niggas ain't right, ain't right

[Verse 2: Lil Herb]
I don't fuck with you fuck niggas
When you see me in the street don't say nothin' to me
I ain't taking your word I know niggas ain't real
But that shit ain't mean nothin' to me
And you know you weren't out here with me in the field
So damn right, ain't nothin' for free
I got forty on me, I keep it on me
Don't run up on me
Used to pop out the house, go to school with my gun up on me
8 o'clock on the block with my hand in my pocket
It's already one up on me
And you know how I'm rockin' ain't duckin' on action
Them fuck niggas know where I be
But I can't trust a soul
Gotta watch out for niggas who know where I sleep
Swear to God keep my gun right under my pillow
Don't know til the pull, I don't sleep
Wicked shit, can’t control how I think
And I been on the streets all my life
And I seen my day one niggas die in front of me
Kill a fuck nigga right in-front of me
When the cops question me I don’t know, I just blink
