[Hook]
My niggas told me that we good
And we ain't gon' be broke no mo
We live it up like its our last
Like we can't live it up no mo
I just wanna show these Old Timers
They ain't shit no mo
I'ma turn up on whoever
I cannot go broke no mo
Broke no mo, I can't go broke no mo
Broke no mo, I can't go broke no mo
I just wanna show these Old Timers
They ain't shit no mo
I'ma turn up on whoever
I cannot go broke no mo

[Verse 1]
I can trust myself, I'm OTF
So all that other shit you screamin', keep it over there
I just want a check and 'nem before I check myself
No nigga put me in my place, I got control myself
Niggas in my face for the fame, never change
These niggas gon' make me change
Not change but change, damn
Face bone 40 rearranged, damn
Bitches say I'm hot, that I'm amazin'
Crack call, drug deal, just can't go broke
Never trust a nigga say he come from that club
Real nigga out here, how I was broke
Check a bag bitch, that's all I know

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Tax season, niggas know that MAC squeezin'
Niggas hate when rumors 'round, then we back eatin'
You real huh? Catch a opp and kill huh?
Think I'm a stain, just chill bruh
Now he in a wheelchair
Before I hit a lick, I'ma put up for a brick
I'ma put up for this shit, know I should give it to the mix
I just got some pints, I'ma put 'em in a mix
Bust a block like its blix, put a condo on my wrist
We good, got a ball like woody
Bro tote that fully, mo money
Mo guns, mo pussy
Mo problems, mo drama
Red dot, no duckin'
Green dot, we send mo money
Picked up the car we comin'
We far from broke
Yeah!
