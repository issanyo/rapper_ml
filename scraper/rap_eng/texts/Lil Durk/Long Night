[Intro: Lil Durk]
I done walked the carpet in my Don C's
But I'm in the trenches with Don Q
For real

[Verse 1: Lil Durk & Don Q]
It's a long night, gotta keep yo' gun on you
It's a long night, police gotta run from you
I'm from the part gotta keep that gun on you
Dope boy money, keep them ones on you
Walkin' in Don C's, I'ma go crazy with Don Q (turn up)
Ain't grow up 'round palm trees, we was dependent on W2s
Sittin' in recline seats, you ain't got no tints, you frontin' yo' move
Niggas ain't really for me, the niggas you lovin' be hopin' you lose
Street niggas, all facts, do a hit in the car from CarMax
Glock 30 .45, can't dodge that, these niggas so fake, gotta fall back
Fuck with the other side then it's all bad
You don't know that feelin' then all black
Four deep in the car and it's all Macs
He say he a killer but he all cap
Boyz n the Hood, give his ball back
If you don't, shorty comin' back
I was young countin' hunnid racks (yeah)
In the trenches with a hunnid straps
In the trap with a hunnid packs (Don)
Head shot, he ain't comin' back (yeah, yeah, uh)

[Verse 2: Don Q]
I'm still affiliated with the chain snatchers and the trappers and name hatters (name hatters), yeah
Real bosses, they gon' take losses and they never complain at 'em (never complain at 'em), yeah
I leave the venue in a Rolls Royce then I jump on a plane at 'em (I take a flight)
I get you get you hit like it ain't matter (like it ain't matter)
From up close, see the brain matter (whoa)
I know that hating's contagious, most of these niggas be playin' courageous (niggas be playin' courageous)
Truthfully told, I'm still in the hood, so I don't be sayin' I made it (so I don't be sayin' I made it)
It was a toll to go to the hood, you had to pay it to claim it (you had to pay it to claim it)
We had them Os inside of the hood, we had to weigh and contain it (we had to weigh and contain it)
I make a plan, exchange it (yeah)
Then we gon' cook up whatever's remainin' (yeah, yeah, yeah)
My hitter ridin' in the passenger (passenger)
Yeah, 'cause I heard that they want it with me (I heard that they want it with me)
And I been dyin' to send them after ya (after ya)
Long as I'm payin' they bail, they comin' for free (whoa, whoa)
Hit the spot and they ain't pattin' us (what!?)
He keep a pair right under the tee
Some advice for my challengers
I hope you niggas prepared when you run into me
Bitch!

[Outro: Lil Durk & Don Q]
It's a long night, gotta keep yo' gun on you
For real nigga, Chiraq, NY, same shit, nigga
Gang
It's a long night, police gotta run from you
Don, bitch!
Walkin' in Don C's, I'ma go crazy with Don Q (turn up)
