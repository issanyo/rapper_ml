[Intro: Lil Durk with Tion Phipps]
Rich town made this beat
Who made this beat?
At the fuckin sun up
At the autopilot poppin
I said all the jury shoppin
[?] All I need [?] All I need
Preach

[Hook: Ca$h Out with Tion Phipps]
All I need, all I need, all I need, all I need, all I need, all I need
All I need is some loyalty
All I need, all I need, all I need, all I need, all I need, all I need
All I need is some loyalty
Ima hold it down (down)
Things go down (things go down)
No turn around
All I need is some loyalty (some loyalty)
I talked to God to see if he can make it better
And I can't send some letters
Loyalty


[Verse 1: Ca$h Out]
Sound like the talk that I had with my nigga yesterday (watcha talkin' bout?)
Waiting on the pills sitting down for pills to play
I tell em yal need to keep ya head up
And when pressure gets tight niggas don't let up
But niggas gotta get wet up
For thinking this is a set up
Sounds like shit I feel man
If I was in your shoes I'd kill a nigga
I see you nigga (that real shit)
Green dot, green dot, ass little foe (ass little foe)
She got a little flag she like leave her alone
Who can I trust family members
Ooh this shit is stressful (this shit is stressful)
Had to read up and got a good heart and left niggas extra
Ride with my two (with my two), no extras (if only)
Askin myself this question
I'm feeling lonely
Preach

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Lil Durk]
Loyalty over Royalty
She got a bag so she spoiled to me
Long days she be spoiling me
In her room and she starts calling me
Louie loafers sit on Louie sofa
Said she cheating and they don't even know it
All I need, all I need, all I need
All I need is to lean on her shoulder
Real niggas cry too
Real niggas die too
But who is you to lie to?
I won't lie, keep my arms high
And I love who I lie too
Free lie, free beef, free lawsuit
And keep your mouth closed
Don't you talk to thot hoes
Every getting money nigga got those
Ima ride with my nigga (yea)
Ima die with my nigga (yea)
Magazine with a magazine I'm bout one nigga (bluh)
And my arms stay high (arms stay high)
But she awfully damn good
Freedom is a lie
Bitch freedom is [?]

[Hook]
