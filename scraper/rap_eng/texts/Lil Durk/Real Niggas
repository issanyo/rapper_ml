[Intro]

[Chorus: Lil Durk]
Rollin', my block be rollin', them niggas lookin'
Niggas just jumped off porches, them niggas rookies
Shooters, my shooters shootin', they tote their hoodies
Real niggas fuck with with real niggas, that's important
Rollin', my block be rollin', them niggas lookin'
Niggas just jumped off porches, them niggas rookies
Shooters, my shooters shootin', they tote their hoodies
Real niggas fuck with with real niggas, that's important

[Verse 1: Lil Durk]
Nina go, "Falah", but that nickel go, "Ha-ra-da-tat"
Chillin' with my savage at that block that be my habitat
Run up on me, think again, [?] ain't havin' that
Thirty, pop a shawty, got Chicago where it's levelled out
[?], we'll clap you up -- get killed
Fuck a major, big mistake, wish I could switch deals
[?], he facin' twelve, my daddy facin' wheels
I grow up selling D, fuckin' hoes and poppin' pills
Finessin', we walkin' reckless, my niggas reckless
Lil' nigga robbin' habits and snatchin' necklace
Lil Reecey, he make that tax bit, flip bricks like Tetris
Ex-bitch, she fucked my next bitch, that shit be hectic

[Chorus: Lil Durk]
Rollin', my block be rollin', them niggas lookin'
Niggas just jumped off porches, them niggas rookies
Shooters, my shooters shootin', they tote their hoodies
Real niggas fuck with with real niggas, that's important
Rollin', my block be rollin', them niggas lookin'
Niggas just jumped off porches, them niggas rookies
Shooters, my shooters shootin', they tote their hoodies
Real niggas fuck with with real niggas, that's important

[Verse 2: Lil Snupe]
I said you fuckin' with the wrong one
Nigga, you might as well shoot yourself
Man, my dog clutching, keep that thing right on that Gucci belt
Shoot anybody, give a fuck 'bout your feelings
All your niggas be talkin' and all my niggas be killin'
We a homicide, nigga, yeah, I'ma ride
Anybody play with my team, nigga, your momma die
Yeah, I'm a Zone 4 nigga, a Zone 4 killer
I don't give a fuck 'bout you or any nigga who with you
I roll with shooters, niggas who love that gun sound
And anybody get out of line, then you get gunned down
Only fuck with real; if you a fuck nigga, don't come round
Pussy think that I won't merk him 'cause I'm out the slum now

[Chorus: Lil Durk]
Rollin', my block be rollin', them niggas lookin'
Niggas just jumped off porches, them niggas rookies
Shooters, my shooters shootin', they tote their hoodies
Real niggas fuck with with real niggas, that's important
Rollin', my block be rollin', them niggas lookin'
Niggas just jumped off porches, them niggas rookies
Shooters, my shooters shootin', they tote their hoodies
Real niggas fuck with with real niggas, that's important

[Verse 3: Meek Mill]
Meek Milly
I say whole clique some real niggas
We don't fuck with no fake niggas
I spin through your block with three Ks like I hate niggas
Catch 'em slippin', we walk down
Ain't got time to chase niggas
Everybody be hatin' on us, but everybody don't play with us
You get the shit, push back
Picture [?], blue walls
[?] on his face
Yeah, I did [?]

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus: Lil Durk]
Rollin', my block be rollin', them niggas lookin'
Niggas just jumped off porches, them niggas rookies
Shooters, my shooters shootin', they tote their hoodies
Real niggas fuck with with real niggas, that's important
Rollin', my block be rollin', them niggas lookin'
Niggas just jumped off porches, them niggas rookies
Shooters, my shooters shootin', they tote their hoodies
Real niggas fuck with with real niggas, that's important
