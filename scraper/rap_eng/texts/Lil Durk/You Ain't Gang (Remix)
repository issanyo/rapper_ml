[Intro: Lil Bibby]
Hey

[Hook: Lil Bibby]
Nigga you can't hang, you ain't gang, gang
You can't hang, nigga you can't hang, you ain't gang, gang
Nigga you can't hang, you can't hang, hang
You can't, you can't hang, you ain't gang, gang

[Verse 1: Lil Bibby]
Bitch I'm an OG, but I'm quick to pull it like a youngin'
In my pockets, all hundreds, run up on me, bitch I'm drummin'
I was thuggin' on the corner with my niggas, came from nothin'
Fuck these bitches, I don't trust 'em, I'm a dog, fuck her cousin
They like, "Goddamn Bibby why you still on that block shit?"
Get you shot quick 'round them niggas I don't rock with
I seen niggas turned Christian when they feel that hot shit
Thought you was a savage, now you on that Lord watch shit
Give a fuck if you box well, I got hot shells
Drop Ls, pull up back to back and give your block hell
Pistol whip your kids, I'm a demon, I'ma rot in Hell
Do the time, I will not tell like I'm Vondell

[Hook: Lil Bibby]
Nigga you can't hang, you ain't gang, gang
You can't hang, nigga you can't hang, you ain't gang, gang
Nigga you can't hang, you can't hang, hang
You can't, you can't hang, you ain't gang, gang

[Verse 2: Lil Durk]
Why you floss, pussy you ain't squad, pussy you ain't hard
Catch a charge bitch I'm like a God, Varney pulled his card
Crackin' calls, boy I'd get you robbed, 100 thousand large
Think I'm smart get that baby lost, like my lean dark
ATL, pull up we in dark heard you was a cop, you a opp
Flexin' boy don't start dracos in the car
Me I'm Durk, city hate me worst think they hate me first, it's a curse
Now it's me and DeJ, 40 in the purse pussy try us
Yo' IG a liar got the streets on light
2 times, say it 2 times bitch I am a fire
Plain Jane, fuckin' with the town call 'em Mary Jane
Street nigga yeah we gang gang let the chain hang (Gang!)

[Hook: Lil Bibby]
Nigga you can't hang, you ain't gang, gang
You can't hang, nigga you can't hang, you ain't gang, gang
Nigga you can't hang, you can't hang, hang
You can't, you can't hang, you ain't gang, gang

[Verse 3: DeJ Loaf]
Who's cuz came with 'em?
Who's blood came with 'em?
See them niggas right there, them thugs right there
Go 'head I'd dare ya
All that talkin' don't scare me
We ain't ask you no questions
We don't need no answers
Them niggas hoes for real
I'm gettin' dough for real
Bitch think she bad
This boss for real
We know you talk for real can't hang with me and my Dobermans
What they gon' do with us
Niggas ain't foolin' us
Choppa with the dick tell me who to bust
Close the door, pull up and ring the doorbell
It's a full mink, not a Montclair
You a fuckin' worker and I'm a boss player

[Hook: Lil Bibby]
Nigga you can't hang, you ain't gang, gang
You can't hang, nigga you can't hang, you ain't gang, gang
Nigga you can't hang, you can't hang, hang
You can't, you can't hang, you ain't gang, gang

[Verse 4: Kevin Gates]
We don't run, I'm in charge
Cookin' soft, sellin' hard
Went to jail I got off
You was scared to walk the yard
On a big stand on all tens
Caught me drinkin' lord
Iron power push a lot of weight
Naw hah you had thought
Breakin' down a whole thang ain't got to stretch it any questions
Ball faze bought for all the Js and I'm 'bout to bless 'em
Female entertainers wanna fuck with gangsta, you ain't special
No karate thord kick spent the TEC with the suppressor
Breadwinner Mafia stiffin' up all Benz
Sly Polaroid swag I'm makin' bags with a business
Action passing extension and they actin' as a convinct
John Gotti body go in body bag it get zipped
Telescope go on top of the rifle they think I'm triflin'
Football field cleats go to lockin' in like arthritis
Pussy shit uninvited how wrong for no invitements
(?) twistin' (?) on landlords
60 racks slipped, bullshit in the backyard

[Hook: Lil Bibby]
Nigga you can't hang, you ain't gang, gang
You can't hang, nigga you can't hang, you ain't gang, gang
Nigga you can't hang, you can't hang, hang
You can't, you can't hang, you ain't gang, gang

[Outro: Lil Bibby]
You can't hang, nigga, nigga, you ain't gang
You can't hang, hang
You already know, man
Boss gang shit
Gang
