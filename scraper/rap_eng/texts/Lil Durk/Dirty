[Chorus: Lil Durk]
The way I did you in my past, I feel horrible
Catch me cheatin' with some bitches, I felt I told the truth
After tellin' money took over all my love for you
I'm in love, I'm in love, I'm in love with you
You did me dirty (whoa whoa)
I did you dirty (yeah yeah yeah yeah)
You did me dirty (whoa whoa)
I did you dirty, I did you dirty

[Verse 1: Hypno Carlito]
Spend a lot of time on the road, I know you alone, you wish I was home
Been times I ain't pick up the phone, smoke one to the dome, what know what you on
You did me dirty, I did you dirty
You saw them bitches always ask me and I say don't worry
More money, more problems, don't care, just more dollars
Fuck dude and who had cosigned him
Sneak disser, pussy, so childish
I'm lowkey bought a low rider
We both got love we both hidin'
I beat it up, I'm so violent
Can't fly without my copilot
You did me dirty, don't lie to me
It's either yes or no, no probably
No matter what, you s'posed to ride for me
You kept some secrets that'll bother me
But fuck that shit, just get on top of me

[Chorus: Lil Durk]
The way I did you in my past, I feel horrible
Catch me cheatin' with some bitches, I felt I told the truth
After tellin' money took over all my love for you
I'm in love, I'm in love, I'm in love with you
You did me dirty (whoa whoa)
I did you dirty (yeah yeah yeah yeah)
You did me dirty (whoa whoa)
I did you dirty, I did you dirty

[Verse 2: Yung Tory]
You did me dirty, I did you dirty too
You didn't want me when I was broke, now I pull up with convertible
If you fuck another nigga, I swear I might murder you, ooh
You say you the shit, no nigga I ain't heard of you, ooh
Yeah I'm that nigga, she know
You say that your man, he in the club, askin' for bottles, he broke
VVS's in my mouth, so cold
And I got Gucci on me nigga, I don't rock Polo, hey
Got your bitch on me, asked her to roll-roll, hey
Ayy just seen your bitch suckin' dick my nigga, I think you should take her home
I'm smokin' dope out the zip my nigga, I swear I'm in love with this throat
Why she on my line my nigga, your bitch do the most

[Chorus: Lil Durk]
The way I did you in my past, I feel horrible
Catch me cheatin' with some bitches, I felt I told the truth
After tellin' money took over all my love for you
I'm in love, I'm in love, I'm in love with you
You did me dirty (whoa whoa)
I did you dirty (yeah yeah yeah yeah)
You did me dirty (whoa whoa)
I did you dirty, I did you dirty
