[Hook: $tupid Young]
Aye, we got Glocks and Mooses nigga fuck a Tech
We gon slide on nigga if he disrespect (BRR!!)
And I put that on my gang, put that on my set
If the homie say it's war, tell 'em it's a bet
Ooh it's a gon' be a murda scene
It's a gon' be a murda scene
Yeah it's a gon' be a murda scene nigga
Ooh it's a gon' be a murda scene
It's a gon' be a murda scene
Yeah it's a gon' be a murda scene

[Verse 1: $tupid Young]
I be with the killas and the thugs
I be with all the drug dealers and the plugs
If a nigga want funk then wassup
We pull up, pop out with the gang, give a fuck
I don't fuck with Duece Dueces cause they jammers
Every time we put in work got the scanners
The A hat but that ain't for Atlanta
It's for AsianBoyZ and you don't understand us
Pull up-pull up on ya block with the 30 shots, fuck a opp
Body rock, when that shotty pop, ghetto birds on top
Everything I got, nigga had to hustle or a flock
Comin' straight from the block, to the motherfuckin' top
Young hot Asian nigga without a record deal
Fuck a record deal nigga, cause my record real
You wanna meet me nigga, come out in the field
We can go toe-to-toe or we can shoot it out with steels cuhz

[Hook: $tupid Young]
We got Glocks and Mooses nigga fuck a Tech
We gon' slide on nigga if he disrespect (BRR!!)
And I put that on my gang, put that on my set
If the homie say it's war, tell 'em it's a bet
Ooh it's a gon' be a murda scene
It's a gon' be a murda scene
Yeah it's a gon' be a murda scene nigga
Ooh it's a gon' be a murda scene
It's a gon' be a murda scene
Yeah it's a gon' be a murda scene

[Verse 2: Lil Durk]
Killas I contain them, percocet pain pill
Audemaur plain still, early sip of DayQuil
40 Glock face lift, Hellcat spaceship
[?] Dayshift, homicide don't say shit
They hope I don't make it, shooters with me Satan
Stripper bitches shake it, ran outta patience
That snake shit, I hate it
I be with my AJ Gang like I'm AZN
Taking all this lean got me feelin' like I'm Asian
Lookin' at his chain like you need to go appraise it
Standing in the trenches had me goin' through the phases
I'm too exclusive can't be basic
Came from nothing, from the basement
Opposition can't erase me
First hunnid K, I had to chase it

It's a gon' be a murda scene

Ooh it's a gon' be a murda scene
It's a gon' be a murda scene
Yeah it's a gon be a murda scene
