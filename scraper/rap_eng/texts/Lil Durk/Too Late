[Intro: Lil Durk]
Dope
Gang!
Yeah

[Hook: Lil Durk]
Purple water, pour up that berry that's blue rain
Diamond water Tity Boi 2 times, that's like 4 chains
Boss shit, I fucked yo' baby mama in Mulsanne
Fashion geek, fashion week, you should peep my shoe game
Hoes wanna fuck me 'cause the fame, Ay! Ay!
I think I wear more Yeezys than North West and Kim K
Private jet, fuck a key I tell the clip boys that I'm late
.40 on me, if you reading this message you too late

[Verse 1: Lil Durk]
The streets left me hangin' with some niggas I can eat with
Ridin' through with Chicago with some bulls on some street shit
Fuck a lot niggas' hoes 'cause I'm on some me shit
Do a hit, don't go by for yo' mans, he know he hit
Real lean, you a fool you thinkin' that I drink hit
Pull up on yo' bitch i8 drop I might hit the swift
Dab on 'em, A.B in the trap I might jab on 'em
AP, I know them well I spend a couple thou on 'em
3 kids, they don't mean shit don't put no time in it
I ain't talkin' college with these dudes, I put like 5 in it
5 for the glasses, pussy nigga I see 5 men
Slide with me, crippin' with my homie free the guys nigga
2 shots from this Smith that's why they trippin'
2 shots from this henny I can feel it
We come for niggas yeah we know the business
Rob me pussy niggas what's the endin', like
I stunt, gotta open trunk to see the engine
I bust, get up close to me and see that .50
Like I must, get a 100 M's before I'm 50
Like Pine Crush, sip so much lean that I broke my kidneys

Too fly, I can get a mansion up in Dubai
Drive by, only when I land up in the Chi
Feds on me, and these niggas prayin' I get 10 lives
Opps cats, and I know for sure they ain't got 10 lives
Catch 'em one last time tell a pussy nigga bye bye
Street nigga, way before Pac I was thug life
Got up, it fell down twice I was drugged twice
Can’t snitch, bitch I’m gang gang hoe I can’t switch
Great hits, I ain’t talkin' music bitch I’m Ape shit
Fake shit, only come around 'cause we stay lit
Take shit, call Fat Boy Chubbs we gon' tape shit
Man down, bitch my city lit, we don't play 'round
Beefin' with my boys, tell them pussy niggas stand down
Choppas mad rugers good night heard that gun sound
Gonna shoot a nigga in his shit watch the gun shout
