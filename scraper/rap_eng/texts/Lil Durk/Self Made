[Intro]
NOAHINHISBAG, bitch

[Verse 1: Cdot Honcho]
Ayy, I said I love you I lied, me and money allied
Smoking gas can’t lift a eyelid, pull up, Hellcat, demons outside
VVSs stinging your eye, I know it ain’t safe, tennis shoes over 1K
I really don’t rock 'em, my bitch say my shit go to waste
Karats so watery, she tryna cover me, tryna keep up with me, keep up the pace
Riding with a yellow bitch, I couldn’t pass on her, she got a ass, but I couldn’t find a waist
I just left Chase, I’m grinning ear to ear, I got them racks on me, finna go play
Remember I tried to save up 20K, did it and bought me a SRT8
I had the fastest car on the whole block, somehow I got the function too late
Yellowbone bitch and she going both ways, took her, you ain’t seen your ho in four days

[Chorus: Cdot Honcho]
Ayy, self made nigga, you witnessing, flooded my neck ain’t no fishes in it
Two-door, stuffing six bitches in, feet on they neck, I ain’t lifting my shit
Just left the bank, almost left with my cashier, took a dub out, finna shop or whatever
Took my ho out, finna buy her whatever, whoever she left, she ain’t going back ever
Self made nigga, you witnessing, flooded my neck ain’t no fishes in it
Two-door, stuffing six bitches in, feet on they neck, I ain’t lifting my shit
Just left the bank, almost left with my cashier, took a dub out, finna shop or whatever
Took my ho out, finna buy her whatever, whoever she left, she ain’t going back ever

[Verse 2: Cdot Honcho]
Took her away, she ain’t going back over there, designer lover down to my underwear
Dripping you too, ain’t no lil boys over here, three iPhones, no Androids over here
Downtown crib, yeah, Lakeshore over there, ex-nigga mad we get cake more over here
Better pipe down, we slide doors over here, new ice too, all rose gold over there
We can go far if you stop fronting, guarantee you limp when I’m done pumping
Might be tripping, I can’t hear nothing, you’ll be surprised what we got in common
Fell out the sky, baby, I’m a comet, i’m a hero and a villain, I'ma need a comic
Smoking out the pound, everything exotic, never go broke, shit, I made a promise
Say she wanna put my dick in her pocket, have you upside down getting nauseous
Godly shit, come and be a goddess, no rap cap, I’m just being honest

[Chorus: Cdot Honcho]
Ayy, self made nigga, you witnessing, flooded my neck ain’t no fishes in it
Two-door, stuffing six bitches in, feet on they neck, I ain’t lifting my shit
Just left the bank, almost left with my cashier, took a dub out, finna shop or whatever
Took my ho out, finna buy her whatever, whoever she left, she ain’t going back ever
Self made nigga, you witnessing, flooded my neck ain’t no fishes in it
Two-door, stuffing six bitches in, feet on they neck, I ain’t lifting my shit
Just left the bank, almost left with my cashier, took a dub out, finna shop or whatever
Took my ho out, finna buy her whatever, whoever she left, she ain’t going back ever

[Verse 3: Lil Durk]
Fucking a bitch who was dancing at Arnie's, seventeen-hundred, I took her to Barney’s
Take her to the crib, fuck her to Cardi B, I don’t go out, you can order to eat
Trackhawk Hellcat, ordered the seat, black Versace two-chain sneaks
Fuck all them niggas, they know they deceased, Glock with the switch, better order the piece
All the Chanels get the early release, Naked Famous only with Wheats
Fuck it, I ride like I’m Honcho, I know a bitch fucking on rappers for Honchos
Counting this money a turn on, first time in a foreign, you couldn’t get it to turn on
Yeah, I'ma just fuck with the streets, busting off pills when I fuck her to sleep
I’m fucking with niggas who fucking with me, the bitches you cherish ain’t nothing to me
And I go eat at the busiest Bee’s

[Chorus: Cdot Honcho]
Ayy, self made nigga, you witnessing, flooded my neck ain’t no fishes in it
Two-door, stuffing six bitches in, feet on they neck, I ain’t lifting my shit
Just left the bank, almost left with my cashier, took a dub out, finna shop or whatever
Took my ho out, finna buy her whatever, whoever she left, she ain’t going back ever
Self made nigga, you witnessing, flooded my neck ain’t no fishes in it
Two-door, stuffing six bitches in, feet on they neck, I ain’t lifting my shit
Just left the bank, almost left with my cashier, took a dub out, finna shop or whatever
Took my ho out, finna buy her whatever, whoever she left, she ain’t going back ever
