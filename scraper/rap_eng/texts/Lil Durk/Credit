[Verse 1: Kur]
Really don't matter, long as you happy, I'm happy, I'm cool
Even if I didn't have it, I made sure I had it for you
Time I got whipped with the ratchet, we was headed to the stu
Red off whites, I've been catching them
I told my mama I was stressin, she told me, get back in the booth
Told her, this shit is depressing, they don't give crdit when it's due
What, you goin go back to Redgy, cause you think this shit ain't for you
Member, when we opened them letters, we couldn't pay rent when it's due
Coope with my niggas, that's 7, smokin that 7 together
Or better, put this shit first
Ain't thought bout pleasure, I ain't know my worth, there was times when I settled
I used to surve off them bikes that I pettled
That was Tori, just hopped off that 7
Look at me scorin on bitches that's yello
Rainin in that Porsh, but it get bbetter
Never wifing these whores, I ain't gotta
You know I know better, straight to them Ms, you know where I'm headed
I be tryna fuck, I don't wanna message
Tryna hold niggas up, but niggas get jealous
Shit getting hektic, can bairly keep up
They wanna kill me, shady as fuck
After eating breakfast, they wanna go crazy as fuck
If I keep this up, I know Imma get it

[Verse 2: Lil Durk]
The trenches real for us, I know a lot of niggas kill for us
They don't understand how it make you feel, I be all on them billboards
I'm still goin, and I know lost his blood cousin and I feel for him
REeal for him, you a fool, so you do what you gotta do, get them bills goin
Tryna sell his music to the world, but he can't,, cause he a lil youngin
Putit on my mama can't, no one want me here, there was a condem there
I'm breakin the silants of the streets, they ain't never goin have peace
I'm in there knee deep, tryna surve to the TT
Can't let them catch me, they goin termanate my leese
