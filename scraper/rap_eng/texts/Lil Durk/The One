[Hook: Lil Durk & DeJ Loaf]
I just want the money fuck the fame
When we got together they couldn't believe it
I want you for you so fuck a name
Right up in their faces they ain't even see us
I'm sippin' lean just to ease the pain
Ride for each other let's call it even
I wanna love don't be afraid
We too real they can't beat us
I know she's the one
I know he's the one
I know she's the one
I know he's the one

[Verse 1: Lil Durk]
I like her demeanor (Let's get it)
Like French and Trina
Like Nicki and Meek, like Drake and Serena (L's)
Like Bobby and Whitney she havin' henny while I just be leanin' (drank)
We can buy it like a snake, no TMZ, this other shit easy (Let's get it, L's)
I'ma eat it like I'm 'posed to, stop actin' shy know you want to
Teach me how to do it you my coach too (my coach too)
And If you don't I'ma coach you (coach you)
Let's hit the bar take more shots (more shots)
Cut the phones off, take yo' clothes off
Make sure the doors locked, eat it 'til you cum when yo' toes lock
Had to put my ex on the block list, can't nobody hate can't stop this (can't stop this)
Can't nobody hate we at the top of this (the top of this)
And she look good when she topless
Yeah, and she look good when she topless (yeah yea yea yea yea)
I want this shit forever ever
Don't want you to leave never
No overseas 'cause I'ma felon (Let's get it)
Can't get away baby
OTF get it gang baby (gang gang)
And you know they name chasin'
And you know they fame chasin'
Ain't no nigga like me

[Verse 2: DeJ Loaf]
I used to party all night, party all day
Now I'm sittin' at home with you baby
Tie me up got me chained
Lazy love got me hate
It's that real shit
We step out this cuts
He don't really like the cameras
He don't wanna go to war
He got me spoiled, hustlin' is his sport
Had to play hard 'fore he got me
He like when I play with my fingers
It don't matter them new gold Huaraches
He like how I sound like (?)
He know I ain't in it for fame
You know that I've really been poppin'
I'm workin' real hard for my name (DeJ)
I take on my cup and sit on his lap
(?) them bitches starin' at us
He here for a reason bitch stop tryin' to guess when he chillin' with me, ay bitch stop tryin' text
This makeup apperance and that smile is tellin' me about yo' convo let me put you to rest
I knew he was different he got his own check, a savage, all of them tats on yo' neck
I had it, I ain't have to pay for it
It's mine, I really put in leg work and so you want it
I'ma make you beg for it, nigga please, give me what I asked for
All of them hoes that you had they ain't got shit on me either
And most of this niggas want the fame and they ain't own shit either
