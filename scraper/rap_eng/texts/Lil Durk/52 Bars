[Verse]
30 30's with 30's,30 niggas we dirty
I got my shooters they shooting, we show them niggas no mercy
From the pot to the block, from the block to the lot
I got to duck from the ops, they be too cool with the cops
See my life like a movie, I caught a case for the tooly
The judge given out ten I ain't scared I do it
So if a nigga run up on me I react with the uzi
If a nigga run up on me I react with the uzi
Son needed his daddy I still need him right now
He doing life in the Feds need that appeal right now
I catch a body I'm gone, I'm dipping right out of town
I see the scout who told he getting pelled right down
L's up to I die, blood, sweat, and some tears
Def Jam they signed me, complete my dream as a kid
Got locked up told my celly, he thinking life is a gig
Tell'em all I'm on TV MTV I'm the shit
I hit a stain on some bricks, I can't look back I'm ahead
I can't look back on this bread, I guess disease is to rare
One did and it spread where I be 64th
All that rating is dead I put a nine to his head
Lil rock snatched for attempt lawyer money I got him
If he can't hold weight he best believe I'm gonna spot'em
I can't sit in the streets and let my real niggas rotting
All black like I'm Bruce, so who think that was robbing
And they drop my advanced, I'ma cop me up six
I'ma carry a fenz and I'ma cop me a Benz
I got Tommy's and Mac's, 40 cals, Glock 10's
Momma told me you gon make it but, you can't get it in
I'm a trapper to rapper, real niggas to actors
Same people who’s fans they use to say ain't a factor
I'm on top of the city, so them rumors ain't matter
8 balls the size of baseballs in the field I'ma batter
A nigga tried to kill me dead, ops tried to wheel me in
Like the Cubs in '79 them niggas won't win again
Judge told me eye to eye PD riding on her end
Get caught with another slammer they say they first offer 10
I can't change up like a penny, I want head just like a penny
You won’t catch in the telly, catch me in back of the Bentley
Niggas know I'm nailing shit, niggas know we killing shit
I don't really give a fuck all my niggas we be in it
We be 30 deep at least 30 of us polled up
Taking risk that I hope and see my baby growing up
Russian roulette in the streets, life is all about luck
Pussy, money, weed, loyalty, trust is what a nigga lust
I'ma I'm packing like a Green Bay Packer, all white Challenger, saltine cracker
Free all of my niggas doing more than 3 calenders
Pigs snatched me up, smacked me up cause I ain't answer them
Can't snitch ain't a bone in my body say bitch
I can't switch, half them shooters ain't shooting they faking
I'm savage, my teacher always told me I ain't average
She said Lil Durk he'll shoot I remind them of the Mavericks
(let's get it)
