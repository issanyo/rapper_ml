[Hook]
Sumo, sumo, sumo, sumo
Sumo, sumo, sumo, sumo
Call me Sosa Sumo
Pull up wit that you know
That Breitling in that four door
I don't like no two door
Sumo, sumo, sumo, sumo, sumo
Sumo, sumo, sumo, sumo, sumo
Pull up wit that you know
Your thottie in the glue tho
She gon let me fuck tho
Cuz I got my jewels on

[Verse 1]
Are you sumo flexin'? Are you sumo flexin'?
When you pull her do you hop out flexin' like you sumo wrestlin'?
Ay, are you connected? Have your jewels been tested?
Do you smoke tooka pack man? Or you smoke fooka pack man
Ay, I hopped up out the foreign
Like I just hopped out of Cooley
Got a tech with them damn [?]
I spit it, and out here shooting shit
My house got a pool and shit
I be on my sumo shit
I cannon ball up in the water
Swear I just be doing shit
Watch bling like Gucci shit
Chain bling like Tunchei shit
I swear I be sumo flexin'
I be on my Rakishi shit
I be on my Beamer shit
Remember Mitsubishi shit
Getting all this money I swear thats that they dont see me shit
