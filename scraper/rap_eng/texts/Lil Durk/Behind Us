In the streets, in the skreets yeah
Gang!

Lud Foe what up!

[Hook: Lud Foe]
Just me give a reason to get to squeezin'
Shawty got that wet wet that pussy be squeakin'
She said she in love with me but I don't trust her
In the stu I be spittin' rhymes, Busta
This nigga say he want beef, was like hol' up
And he say in the streets but he really in the skreets
If you lookin' for the gang, you know where to find us
It's a whole bunch of money and guns behind us

[Verse 1: Lud Foe]
If he want a feature gotta pay a small fortune to me
I'm shootin 3 bitch I'm ballin' I got Jordan in me
Like a Alcoholic bitch I keep a .40 with me
And dissin' me 'cause he broke he a shawty to me
4 bulldogs bread like O-Dog, slippin' only make that nigga sorry that he dozed off
I get a redbone and make her take her clothes off
Police pull me over just to see why my doors off
And you get Animosity when niggas murderin' shit
Bitches say they love me but I ain't with the personal shit
I pull up on yo' block shoot a nigga, fuck who I hit
And I'ma trapstar so I gotta brick on my wrist
My niggas in the pen they doin' time for this shit
When my uncle died I swear I almost lost my mind to this shit
Like I'm on a plane state-to-state, grindin' and shit
I add to the safe now I'm multiplyin' this shit

[Hook: Lud Foe]
Just me give a reason to get to squeezin'
Shawty got that wet wet out that pussy be squeakin'
She said she in love with me but I don't trust her
In the stu I be spittin' rhymes, Busta
This nigga say he want beef, was like hol' up
And he say in the streets but he really in the skreets
If you lookin' for the gang, you know where to find us
It's a whole bunch of money and guns behind us

[Verse 2: Lil Durk]
Andale mama and I'll eat ya
Trappin' out the building servin' junkies in the Nissan
Big homie a bitch on bailin' banks he a peon
Flyin' private jets on the gang I'ma kill y'all
Me young Durk, I got the city I'ma swag on 'em
I took yo' shit yo' ass a bitch and I'ma brag on it
I can fuck yo' bitch and I'ma switch 'cause I put 9 on it
I took the case I told them niggas but they lied on it
(Gang gang gang!)
I just told that bitch I don't eat groceries
Hit my jeweler I need diamonds in my rosary
L's a shell no more L's that's how it's 'posed to be
I got killas from the cell that was coachin' me
In the club yeah sellin' that couch for Min-yong need a plug yeah
'Cause he might vouch for me and I keep my gun here
'Cause niggas out for me gotta watch these rappers 'cause these niggas want some clout from me

[Hook: Lud Foe]
Just me give a reason to get to squeezin'
Shawty got that wet wet that pussy be squeakin'
She said she in love with me but I don't trust her
In the stu I be spittin' rhymes, Busta
This nigga say he want beef, was like hol' up
And he say in the streets but he really in the skreets
If you lookin' for the gang, you know where to find us
It's a whole bunch of money and guns behind us
