[Intro]
Chopsquad

[Chorus]
I can't get over my pain
Make you feel better
Fuck with niggas I know
Won't make you feel better
This is a lifestyle that I live
Fuckin' with these different bitches
And you tryna break my heart
Fuckin' with these different niggas
You know you can't get over me
You know you can't get away from me
You know bitches dont play with me
You know you know

[Verse 1]
I know the consequences of my actions
This shit real I ain't even just rappin'
Fuckin' with niggas that I know get back
How I know that boy ain't smash
I know you with him cause he gotta sack
You say you don't like no feelings attached
I know that you lied can't mix it with facts
Ho
You think ima run back to you that shit dead
Tell 'em how me and you be textin' each other yeah
So you told me you wouldn't fuck him
Know you lyin' why you scared
You know I gotta bitch, don't open your message, leave you on read
Can't talk to you like I used to
Can't see me you gotta pull up YouTube
Even though my situation you lose
Fuckin' with your friend ex, nigga you screwed
I know you tryna figure out who I'm talkin about
I told you imma spazz told me put the guns down
You got 'em around your kids when they ain't around
I can fuck on who I want, I'm famous now
Got yo friends all in yo ear sayin' that I'm bad
And you keep on listenin' it make me mad
Keep on reminiscing make me want to slide
It seem like that you sold your heart for a bag

[Chorus]
I can't get over my pain
Make you feel better
Fuck with niggas I know
Won't make you feel better
This is a lifestyle that I live
Fuckin' with these different bitches
And you tryna break my heart
Fuckin' with these different niggas
You know you can't get over me
You know you can't get away from me
You know bitches dont play with me
You know you know

[Verse 2]
Fuck this shit
You broke my heart so many times I was like fuck a bitch
I just wanna get the money nigga for the fuck of it
Fuck them other niggas that you fuck with I don't fuck with them
Tell your brother stay from around me cause I don't fuck with him
They don't really want no war with me it ain't enough of them
You barely kinky but you a slut for him
You ain't even that mean, but you tough for him
You had me soft I couldn't function it
Only gave me pussy, wasn't suckin' it
I heard the rumors who you fuckin' with
I wish I found out sooner that you a dirty bitch
Back to the basics, lets speak facts
I was with you when I was sippin' act
I doped you up you has menthol swag
Square, I don't ever wanna see yo ass
Yea, I know imma dog that shit ain't fair
Thought I'll be mad I don't even care
Now I put my new bitch on the Lear
Diamonds in the air like chandeliers
If she around then I'm aware
You say ''only him,'' you lyin' again
Bluetooth in the coupe you need to pair
That hoe shit was in the air
If your friends a ho then you's a ho
Wherever you go I know they go
Don't follow your dream you follow bankrolls
Yo ass so fake thought you was ten toes

[Chorus]
I can't get over my pain
Make you feel better
Fuck with niggas I know
Won't make you feel better
This is a lifestyle that I live
Fuckin' with these different bitches
And you tryna break my heart
Fuckin' with these different niggas
You know you can't get over me
You know you can't get away from me
You know bitches dont play with me
You know you know
