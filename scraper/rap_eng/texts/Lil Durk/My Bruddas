[Intro]
B-R-U-D-D-A, my brothers
V-U-L-T-U-R-E-S, my vultures
You know what I'm talkin' about?

[Chorus]
I'm down to ride for my brothers, no
Can't no nigga talk bad about my brothers, no
Can't no nigga send shots at my brothers, no
And I ain't got nobody, yeah I got my brothers, yeah, ayy
Nigga talkin' 'bout robbin' me, gotta deal with my brothers, yeah
If a nigga talkin' 'bout fightin' me, gotta deal with my brothers, yeah
My brothers
B-R-U-D-D-A, them my brothers, yeah yeah

[Verse 1]
My brothers, my brothers
Won't trade on them niggas for nothin'
Gave Ikey a strap 'cause he gutter
If he was gon' stink me he would've
VVS lookin' like sugar
Young nigga, same bad bitch
Flippin' on 'em, baby mama trippin'
Took the crib and told her she was trippin'
Hoppin' out a Taurus, nigga drillin'
We was wild, poppin' penicillin
Running hoes without no condom
Mama rushing us to the doctor
I remember niggas trickin' with Ikey
Got 'em on the corner then I had shot 'em
See you got it, watch who you be messin' with
See, that's they problem
Mud brothers, different mothers
Not blood brothers but I love 'em
I remember riding with the thumper
It's like one love 'cause they love us
I remember sliding on the lord
Free Big Lord, that's my boy
Before we used to FaceTime the opp
Remember was callin' off them joints
Said we gon' kick it, said we gon' catch it
Said we gon' kill you, said we gon' stretch you
I bet you I bet you, you was safe when I met you, huh
I get killed, it's an inside job, huh
You can't get close, only my squad (gang gang)
Rest in peace LA, it's on my arm (yeah)
Before I rapped I was on my own (I was on my own)
Got my first gun on my own (on my own)
Ain't have my first song on my own, it was us

[Chorus]
I'm down to ride for my brothers, no
Can't no nigga talk bad about my brothers, no
Can't no nigga send shots at my brothers, no
And I ain't got nobody, yeah I got my brothers, yeah, ayy
Nigga talkin' 'bout robbin' me, gotta deal with my brothers, yeah
If a nigga talkin' 'bout fightin' me, gotta deal with my brothers, yeah
My brothers
B-R-U-D-D-A, them my brothers, yeah yeah

[Verse 2]
Twin got shot, got his lick back, same day
Varney got shot, now he can't walk, that shit lame
I remember Pat crashed the rental
Vaughn got caught after bender
Blocks, don't get caught
After dark where I'm from
Fuckin' ratchet hoes fun
Remember hot flame across the quarter
Remember hoes go and steal from Nordstrom's, ah-uh
Fuck these niggas, they too clumsy
Fuck these niggas, ain't got no money
Older brother turned me junky
Percocets in my stomach
Ditched school, we thought that shit was cool
Teachers said I'm a fool, now I got a crib with a big pool
Now I got a crib with big guns
Police come at the door, sending shots, hit the floor
Sold coke on Green, two for the five on the green
You won't survive on the streets, you see the monster in me
No new friends I need, roll up the opps, that's weed
Make your bitch drink seed, that's the nut in me
Why you clutchin' nigga? you ain't on nothin' nigga
Bitch say I'ma nut to nigga, they ain't on nothin' nigga
Like fuck them other niggas, they not fuckin' with us
We tuck them cluckers with us, coke and dope official, yeah yeah

[Chorus]
I'm down to ride for my brothers, no
Can't no nigga talk bad about my brothers, no
Can't no nigga send shots at my brothers, no
And I ain't got nobody, yeah I got my brothers, yeah, ayy
Nigga talkin' 'bout robbin' me, gotta deal with my brothers, yeah
If a nigga talkin' 'bout fightin' me, gotta deal with my brothers, yeah
My brothers
B-R-U-D-D-A, them my brothers, yeah yeah
