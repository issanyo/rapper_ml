[Chorus]
Manipulator, instigator
Oh you think you Bigga Rankin, and got some paper
Oh I take a lot of them drugs, they keep my day up
And I hope his lawyer beat his case up
If I tell you I love you and then I love you
If I call you my brother then you my brother
It was part of my struggle, part of my struggle
And you was down and out with me when it was ugly

[Verse 1]
I wanted to tell you a lot of shit but ain't get the chance to
They say that shit gon' fall on me whatever my friends do
And we always sold the link whenever the rent due
And I told my family I got 'em when music break through
Made my first hundred thousand, that's why I feel myself
Man the rumors killed me deeply, I wanted to kill myself
Before I let an opposition do it, I'll kill myself
I feel that pain I thought I'd never feel
Same nigga tricked on me from the sand, mmh
Same niggas that I gave a hand, mmh
Man this shit was not the plan, mmh
Just for thinking they my friends

[Chorus]
Manipulator, instigator
Oh you think you Bigga Rankin, and got some paper
Oh I take a lot of them drugs, they keep my day up
And I hope his lawyer beat this case up
If I tell you I love you and then I love you
If I call you my brother then you my brother
It was part of my struggle, part of my struggle
And you was down and out with me when it was ugly

[Verse 2]
Remember you had gave me chicken I ain't want Chinese
I remember ridin' to 8Ball and MJG
And I got kids so ain't no family price, this shit ain't free
I done put two pills inside me like this shit ain't me
I'm deep inside the hood, for woods they need ID
You was cool but I ain't loyal so I ain't need to breathe
And you was hungry in the county so I sent a sleeve
And I was walkin' around my block, my Glock is stallin' deans, yeah
Chinchillas and gold Rollies, they hood trophies
I remember ridin' dirty, hope I don't get pulled over
And I tried to get a job driving bulldozers
Now it's steamers and high speeds, don't get pulled over

[Chorus]
Manipulator, instigator
Oh you think you Bigga Rankin, and got some paper
Oh I take a lot of them drugs, they keep my day up
And I hope this lawyer beat this case up
If I tell you I love you and then I love you
If I call you my brother then you my brother
It was part of my struggle, part of my struggle
And you was down and out with me when it was ugly
