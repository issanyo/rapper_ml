[Hook]
You want me to lose
No I'm not perfect and I deserve it, take it personal
You scream my name in the middle of Spain like Durkio
I got a story got a movie but nobody know
Believe me I'm real believe I'm trill for real, you should know
Nobody knows nobody knows, nobody knows
Nobody knows nobody knows, nobody knows
Ooh ooh ooh
Nobody knows
Ooh ooh ooh

[Verse 1]
Young nigga I had a curfew
What you don't know won't hurt you
You told police I hurt you
Like fuck that bitch who birth you
Y'all had me at my lowest
I love my brothers who snaked me but I don't wanna show it
Can't fuck with you I'm honest
Locked in that cell my first son I ain't get to see him potty
I'm off them drugs when I get mad I say I'm goin' Scottie
Take off them Gucci's in the trenches I wear Foamposites
Lawyer fees and bond money, I drop big deposits
I drop big deposits, I like my hoe exotic
My gun get molestic they bound to catch a body
My homie got bodied I keep their mommas happy
My kids they goin' to college, I sold dope in Giuseppe's
Allah come help me (mhm), I'm healthy (mhm), I'm wealthy (mhm)
Drink filthy
Niggas, don't get it
Niggas, ain't with it
Bitches want attention, I told 'em they can't get it

[Hook]
You want me to lose
No I'm not perfect and I deserve it, take it personal
You scream my name in the middle of Spain like Durkio
I got a story got a movie but nobody know
Believe me I'm real believe I'm trill for real, you should know
Nobody knows nobody knows, nobody knows
Nobody knows nobody knows, nobody knows
Ooh ooh ooh
Nobody knows
Ooh ooh ooh

[Verse 2]
They ain't love you like I love you
You told me you ain't trust 'em
And you only believe in me told you they say fuck you
Look what they did to the muscle, best believe these niggas gon' touch you
Give the pussy up for free how you know I'ma tussle
You my brother for life
Man that shit don't sit right with me
Niggas say they gon' ride with me
When you died I was on yo' side
Momma, I need you
Your son, he needs you
Your son is evil, they think they equal
These niggas don't get it
Gotta ride around my city
Can't let them get me, ridin' around with my .50
30 percs got me dizzy
Got my gun and got one on top
Keep niggas in my business, ain't no rules in the trenches

[Bridge: ASAP]
All that just be annoyin' folk
If you can't be, ay if you can't be yourself folk, make your own decisions folk I'm cool

[Hook]
You want me to lose
No I'm not perfect and I deserve it, take it personal
You scream my name in the middle of Spain like Durkio
I got a story got a movie but nobody know
Believe me I'm real believe I'm trill for real, you should know
Nobody knows nobody knows, nobody knows
Nobody knows nobody knows, nobody knows
Ooh ooh ooh
Nobody knows
Ooh ooh ooh
