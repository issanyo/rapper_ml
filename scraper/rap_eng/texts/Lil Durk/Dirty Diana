[Intro: YFN Lucci]
Ay not for me
Oh, oh, oh
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Chorus: YFN Lucci & Lil Durk]
You'll never make me stay, so take the weight off of me
I know your every move, so won't you just let me be
I been here times before, but I was too blind to see
That you seduce every man, but ain't no seducing me, girl nah
I done had it all, but hell nah, I'm fed up
Somebody tell me this can't be love
I just let 'em come between us
Dirty Diana

[Verse 1: Lil Durk]
Bitches be actin' like niggas and niggas be actin' like bitches it's [?]
The trenches done made me a monster, told her you with me accept it (yeah)
Your friends done told you I'm wreckless, feelin' left out and neglected (yeah)
Game with me 24/7, they killin' for me so respect it (grrat)
Dirty Diana, drippin' my diamonds, I'm drippin' designer (fashion)
She say I'm a dog, lost in my feelings so where did you find 'em (bitch)
Bitch it's Only The Family, I fucked up and you clowned me, why did you clown me
When I was broke you weren't down, so you can't be around me (yeah, yeah)
You weren't here for me, so you don't hear from me (let's get it)
Fuck Seline, Tiffany, and I don't got no sympathy (yeah, yeah, yeah uh)
The street shit was meant for me (let's get it)

[Chorus: YFN Lucci]
You'll never make me stay, so take the weight off of me
I know your every move, so won't you just let me be
I been here time before, but I was too blind to see
That you seduce every man, but ain't no seducing me, girl nah
I done had it all, but hell nah, I'm fed up
Somebody tell me this can't be love
I just let 'em come between us

[Verse 2: YFN Lucci]
[?] my face, see I ain't the one that you played
Barely got time to waste, see, I ain't got time to play
I ain't got time to date, know I got spots, but I ain't got space
She want a lot, she tryna get paid, she always tryna get backstage
She always tryna work the back page, a young nigga but my sack crazy
Pulled the coupe out the bat cave, pour a duece in the can drink
And she know that I do shit that her man can't
And she know that I be there when no man ain't
Home, yeah, it's been a long year, she been roamin' a whole year
She did wrong, I wanna forget, she been gone, but I want her here
She been wrong and I wanna kill her, Dirty Diana, yeah

[Chorus: YFN Lucci]
You'll never make me stay, so take the weight off of me
I know your every move, so won't you just let me be
I been here time before, but I was too blind to see
That you seduce every man, but ain't no seducing me, girl nah
I done had it all, but hell nah, I'm fed up
Somebody tell me this can't be love
I just let 'em come between us

[Outro: YFN Lucci]
Hey, I done had it all, fed up
Yeah, can't be loved
Yeah, uh huh, Dirty Diana, yeah, yeah uh huh
Dirty Diana, yeah, yeah uh
