[Verse 1]
Have a threesome with your bestie I'ma chance it
Don't take a pic when we together that's a fed shit
I spent over 4-5 racks on these glasses (on these glasses)
I want that purple with my color just like Kansas
Make sure I'm super fly because the cameras (yuh)
Put a mm mm mm mm inside a Tropicana
Sway don't, but the whole hood got the answers (yeah yeah)
Black power in my blood my cousin Lee a panther (let's get it)
Do a buck 50 riding down Lake Shore (skrt)
God took away my niggas they don't make more (yeah)
You take one of mine we gon' take four (do-do-do)
Bitches screaming fake love like a Drake tour (turn up)
We gon' pull up in that truck and it's paid for (turn up)
How you flexing with your homie, shit it ain't yours (let's get it)
Cleaning pots inside the trap but I hate chores (gang)
BJ took mine he catch a case I take yours (brother)
Hitting that dope I gotta take dome (dome)
I'm from the trenches make me hate storms (Chiraq)
How the fuck you on top and you don't make noise? (gang gang)
I brought a hellcat from the trenches and I made it roar (skrt)
We violent, shawty don't be too silent (yeah yeah)
She don't like public, all her pages be private (yeah yeah)
Before I pay a nigga bills I buy fashion (nah)
I fuck her off a perky pill got me lasting (yeah yeah)

[Hook]
Ain't no way that hate can overpower love (woah)
Ain't no money in the world that can buy you trust (woah)
Used to look up to them niggas they in the back of us
Used to be my brother, show me they color
True colors, yeah your true colors (true colors)
True colors, yeah your true colors (true colors)
Niggas sneak dissing while you show your true colors (true colors)
Even with these shades I can see your true colors

[Verse 2]
I can't put no niggas over mine, I'ma over grind
Over time, for more chains I'll over shine
I'm screaming free 'em even if appeals denied
Gave 'em guns just to get some lower time
Like drinking lean shit way too cold with ice
Kidnap your son got me like I'm Uncle Ice
Your ass ain't right, keep my strap like a dyke
They shot my brother, we was in it all night
They don't listen you ain't no politician
And I was broke ain't have no pot to piss in
Don't fuck with too many niggas had to keep my distance
When I do come around I swear I feel the tension
I love my cousin Iris man I swear I miss her
Her daughter look just like her I see her and kiss her
My daddy never seen my kids, only through some pictures
At the time I was fighting cases so I couldn't visit

[Hook]
Ain't no way that hate can overpower love (woah)
Ain't no money in the world that can buy you trust (woah)
Used to look up to them niggas they in the back of us
Used to be my brother, show me they color
True colors, yeah your true colors (true colors)
True colors, yeah your true colors (true colors)
Niggas sneak dissing while you show your true colors (true colors)
Even with these shades I can see your true colors
