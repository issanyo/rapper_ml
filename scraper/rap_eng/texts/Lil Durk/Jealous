Jealous, yeah, they jealous
Jealous, my car got 'em

And I go ham, jealous
Got them niggas, jealous

They jealous of me


[Verse 1:]
I just copped me a new watch and they jealous
Fuck all that other shit my diamonds yellow
Niggas is bitches I do keep that metal
(Do keep that metal, that gun is on me right now)
Only on Twitter when niggas be at you
40 ruger shooter tell 'em I bless you
You niggas ain't got more money then my left shoe (Margiela's)
I tell 'em my niggas so turnt up (OTF my niggas)
They'll burn yo' bridge it get burnt up
I got a bad bitch she look like Tokyo
Niggas wanna compete with me and know they broke
Pull up in that phantom that cost a holy ghost
Niggas be tweakin' with squad they.. (Bang!)


[Hook]


[Verse 2:]
Instagram comments got them niggas hating, pussy
Niggas I call friends be faking
Niggas be tweakin they thought I wouldn't make it
(But I made it right now)
Fuck all these dirty hoes, these bitches basic
Car all white they swear I was racist
I can't be racist this 40 Jamaican (I'mma shoot it right now)
Niggas is bitches, I turn up for what
I just got a deal so I turn down for what
Rondo caught a body I got up a lawyer
Any lawyer call 'em I could afford 'em
Niggas is fraud it's like they write for them
Pull up in the ghost, on some Forgi's
