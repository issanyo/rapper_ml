[Hook: Skippa Da Flippa]
Every real street nigga know a real street nigga, my nigga
And most of these rappers fugazis, they hatin
Broke, never seen no six figures
What it do my nigga, what it do my nigga
What it do my nigga, what it do my nigga
If ever go broke, sell my closet and go back to whipping that dope
What you gon do my nigga? What you gon do my nigga?
Say you real, but you really fake
Spray a bitch nigga when you see him on the interstate
What you been through my nigga? What you been through my nigga?

[Verse 1: Skippa Da Flippa]
What it do my nigga? What you go through my nigga?
What you gon do my nigga? Everybody carry it, but will you pull the trigger?
Look, listen, tell you a little story, when I shot three Robert Horry
Caught him on the highway, nigga that’s my way
And that’s just the middle of the story
The realest shit I done heard is I ain’t gonna die for 'em, I'ma die with' em
Watch for these sneaky snakes filled up with venom
Slit that bitch throat if he don’t tell who seen it
Nigga, what you gon' do, when you find out your ho loving the crew
Relax and sit back and just bust you a brew
And I don’t want your bitch cause she don’t come with two
What you been in to
Do you believe in god, have you read through Hebrews?
I done walked so many miles, sold so many ounces
And I still haven’t seen you
You claim that you real, but I know realer
Chopper under my chinchilla
Jackson 5 hollows, make you dance like Thriller

What you gon do my nigga? What you gon do my nigga?
Say you real, but you really fake
Spray a bitch nigga when you see him on the interstate
What you been through my nigga? What you been through my nigga?

[Verse 2: Lil Durk]
Niggas is fugazi, been had a dope bag 'fore 2 Chainz
Free Boona gave him 21, rob a nigga, for his two chains
Head chopped, got two brains
Autotune, real rap, I got two lanes
Police say give him two names
I’m like Durk Banks, that’s my government
I don’t rap beef this shit so irrelevant
Sipping purp, that’s the medicine
I been off the porch 'fore your hair was bent
Smoking L after L, getting mil' after mil'
Watch my homie take 50, and I been going apeshit 'fore I even heard 50
And my city tote 30s with the beam but we don’t tote 30s, we tote 50s
And them bitches go bang bang, OTF bitch doing the same thing
Snatch your chain if your chain hang
Where I'm from bitch you gon gang bang
Like give me that, run up on his ass like give me that
Don’t call motherfucker, ain’t getting it back
Call up zoo and no chitter chatter
He gon' get on that, let me get that
