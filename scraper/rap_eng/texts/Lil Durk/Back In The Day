[Intro]
We on our OTF shit, you heard?

[Chorus: Nimic Revenue & Lil Durk]
Back in the day when I was young, I'm not a kid anymore
Sometimes I sit and wish I was a kid again
We used to play, nowadays I don't see you anymore
Late nights I swear I miss the feeling
Its those stars who were young and wild
It was my number that you always dialed
Back in the day when I was young, I'm not a kid anymore
You know, you know, you are
Back in the day when I was young, I'm not a kid anymore
You know, you know, you are

[Verse 1: Lil Durk]
Used to hide the drugs in the attic, play ball in the crates in the alley
Five deep one room one [?], growin' up in the streets a challenge
Shout out to the daddies who ain't vanish, shout out to the mothers who ain't vanish
Ain't want her to get her hair did, I told her eat her salad
We was in that shit for real, slide in that Bonneville
They gave me all my bitches, woah, she gave me chills
And I think you scared, you don't wanna turn up no more
President racist, don't go to the Trump no more
Bust down AP platinum with it, met that money I adapted with it
I go broke then its back to trenches, with them killers I gotta admit it
Last thing I'll do is move out the city, got six kids so I gotta get it
'Cause you know

[Chorus: Nimic Revenue & Lil Durk]
Back in the day when I was young, I'm not a kid anymore
Sometimes I sit and wish I was a kid again
We used to play, nowadays I don't see you anymore
Late nights I swear I miss the feeling
Its those stars who were young and wild
It was my number that you always dialed
Back in the day when I was young, I'm not a kid anymore
You know, you know, you are
Back in the day when I was young, I'm not a kid anymore
You know, you know, you are

[Verse 2: Nimic Revenue]
Been drinkin' this shit, I ain't care [?]
Just a [?], mama work double on Wednesdays
Told her one day, she can have it all, yeah
One day, she can have it all
For big bro, run it up like you told me so
Air 23's, you know
I went and bought me some
[?] gotta leave [?]
Hollywood, yeah, nah it's just not in my character
She know me she think that I'm missin' her
In the back of the Phantom I'm kissin' her
Yeah I remember them bad days, young nigga had to make a way
Young body like a fadeaway, nobody had to pave my way
Huh, now bitch you gotta do what I say, goin' all day, it was hard to keep faith
You the cause of my tears, you gon' drown in a lake
Look up to my peers, I don't make no mistake

[Chorus: Nimic Revenue & Lil Durk]
Back in the day when I was young, I'm not a kid anymore
Sometimes I sit and wish I was a kid again
We used to play, nowadays I don't see you anymore
Late nights I swear I miss the feeling
Its those stars who were young and wild
It was my number that you always dialed
Back in the day when I was young, I'm not a kid anymore
You know, you know, you are
Back in the day when I was young, I'm not a kid anymore
You know, you know, you are
