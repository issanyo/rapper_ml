I’m the man, my young niggas ain’t playing
They shoot him for free, ain’t got to pay em
I’m the man, pull up on me I'ma blam
And I say I’m from the land
Gangland, Gangland
Gangland, Gangland
Gangland, Gangland
Gangland, Gangland

[Verse 1:  AD]
Popped a motherfucker to the brain
Westside Errb, 2 C’s with a bang
Chucking up them fingers, lil nigga, what you claim?
You a demonstration if you hating when you play
Black on Blue doe', see the bloods in the city say I’m [?]
Cali thuggin’, we be hanging out the two-doors
Two shots, bumping 2Pac, give me two knots, and I’m cool now
No lie, it was go time
Little homies run up on you, give you Botox
Leave you with a [?], four five with a nine
Bam, going ham, leave his mama screaming oh my
Pussy nigga you a man for nothing
Fuck where you from, you don’t stand for nothing
Super bad when they talking to the cops
Motherfuck the ops on the block, we ain’t playing [?]
Imma slow it down, let me switch the flow
So y’all can understand what I’m spitting
No, fuck that, I buck tracks
Real rap from the land where the pump crack
Right here where it started, see our spitters so retarded
RIP your favorite artist, leave him dead in the party
Been getting cocky for a minute
Had to drop the dead weight, kind of stocky for a minute
Put some diamonds in my watch, playing hockey for a minute
Tryna stop me knuckle up, been playing Rocky for a minute, nigga!

[Verse 2:  DC Young Fly]
Aw shit, boy, you don’t want them problems
At your house, woods surrounded by them choppers
I’m by myself, you tried to get me with your partner
You ain't know I had some under the shirt ready to stop ya
This is not Instagram, you will get killed
A couple of goons, a couple of clips
We hitting up everything, bodies gon 'flip
You niggas be playing, you not with the shit
Until you be laying and stinking in shit
You fuck with my niggas, you lay in the ditch
We pulling out choppers and slanging that shit
You barely can breathe, you thinking and shit
Your body parts everywhere, hanging and shit
You thought it was all fun and games in this bitch
You found out my nigga Buck [?] in this bitch
Y’all niggas be flexing, you lame in this bitch
We taking y’all hoes so we came in this bitch
That’s what you get for claiming that bitch
See you the video, banging this bitch
You thanking that nigga, don’t pay me for shit
Hold up, chill out
My niggas in this bitch, and they wild
Fuck up, get shot
Ha ha, my niggas, man we mob
