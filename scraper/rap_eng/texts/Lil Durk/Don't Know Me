[Hook]
These niggas don’t know me, they act like they know me
These niggas don’t know me, they act like they know me
These niggas don’t know me, they act like they know me
These niggas don’t know me, they act like they know me
These niggas don’t know me, they act like they know me
These niggas don’t know me, they act like they know me
These niggas don’t know me, they act like they know me
These niggas don’t know me, they act like they know me

[Verse 1]
From the city where they gang bang
Where they'll kill you if your chain hang
Two letters, dedicate you like AK
AR, SK
And you got to hide your finesse game
Head shot, no need for a vest game
Cop killers going straight through the desk game
These niggas they bitch, they’ll snitch on you
How you think they feel, get rich on em
You ain’t never do a drill with a brick on em
Even on parole keep the shit on em
No mask, black hoodie with the sticks on him
I lost a couple niggas to this shit
Chiraq, where the guns like Iraq
Where the little niggas cook Pyrex
Where they pull guns out, they’ll fight back
I ain’t gon keep it on the d-low
I'ma make sure my neck worth a kilo
I'ma make sure the TEC got a ten loaded
Wire my connect, call it free load
These niggas they act like they know me
Cut em off cause you niggas so phony
Get money, they’ll call you their brodee
Bitch ass nigga you don’t know me!

[Hook]
These niggas don’t know me, they act like they know me
These niggas don’t know me, they act like they know me
These niggas don’t know me, they act like they know me
These niggas don’t know me, they act like they know me
These niggas don’t know me, they act like they know me
These niggas don’t know me, they act like they know me
These niggas don’t know me, they act like they know me
These niggas don’t know me, they act like they know me

[Verse 2]
Murder rates so high cause of the body count
Every day news casts say a body found
Can’t trust niggas so I keep a chopper round
Play crazy, have a lil bro knock him down
On the block in that Cut when it’s black out
Y’all homies tell bro bring the MACs out
And we’re hungry in the trap house
Every show we’re out, bringing out the racks out
Setup hoes they’ll set you up
How you come when it’s dry they’ll wet you up
Watch out, my niggas at the top
You gotta kiss they ass for them to let you up
And that bring them snakes out
Gunshots that’ll bring them jakes out
Every new rapper they fake now
If you stand we'll call that a take down
Eat with who you sleep with
So blind to the money, you ain’t peeped shit
Ice new niggas, they sneak diss
Imma boss up on em, on some Meek shit
And they don’ know me! They don’t know me
In my city like Tony
You a bitch ass nigga, you don’t know me

[Hook]
These niggas don’t know me, they act like they know me
These niggas don’t know me, they act like they know me
These niggas don’t know me, they act like they know me
These niggas don’t know me, they act like they know me
These niggas don’t know me, they act like they know me
These niggas don’t know me, they act like they know me
These niggas don’t know me, they act like they know me
These niggas don’t know me, they act like they know me
