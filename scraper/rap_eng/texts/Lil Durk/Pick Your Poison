[Hook]
I been running with that street vibe
I fell back off that love shit
You tryna play me for a goofy, that’s that bullshit
I be with robbers like to mug shit
I’d rather be around some niggas I can thug with
Same niggas say they ain’t switch up on me
And this Rollie face a bigger bonus
Hang with the killers homie
Money hungry, getting busy
And the stick up homies
So pick your poison

[Verse 1]
It be so phony
I got locked up, they couldn’t send me a lawyer
My mama had told me
These niggas ain’t real, niggas be actin’ like homies
Screaming they gang, ain’t put in work, that shit be annoying
Police scorcher, gotta watch out when you servin’ that corner
What you know about late night in that trap, you ain’t make no dime, yeah
Or telling your kids you gotta million, still ain’t make no time yet
Or in jail for a body and the judge keep telling you you get no time back
Or when you live in the trenches with the fame, and you live where the crime at
Gangsters was our idols, we don’t believe in titles
True to my religion, we don’t believe in bibles
See one of my rivals, we don’t drive right by you
Glock got a beam, clip stick out like Eiffel

[Hook]
I been running with that street vibe
I fell back off that love shit
You tryna play me for a goofy, that’s that bullshit
I be with robbers like to mug shit
I’d rather be around some niggas I can thug with
Same niggas say they ain’t switch up on me
And this Rollie face a bigger bonus
Hang with the killers homie
Money hungry, getting busy
And the stick up homies
So pick your poison

[Verse 2]
Hell yeah I hold a grudge
These niggas ain’t show no love
These niggas was nowhere to be found, I had low income
How the hell I’ma pay my bills? I had no income
I was always taught to fight, lil boy don’t ever run
My daddy got life in prison, my moms said here he come
And I was posted on that porch and he ain’t never come
Yeah that trap going crazy inside them projects homie
Got out early from the feds, lil boy don’t call my phone
I put my life on the line for niggas who in line
I used to chew on them xannies to get me through the times
I used to believe all them rumors, it took over my mind
And if I put my name on it then that shit is mine

[Hook]
I been running with that street vibe
I fell back off that love shit
You tryna play me for a goofy, that’s that bullshit
I be with robbers like to mug shit
I’d rather be around some niggas I can thug with
Same niggas say they ain’t switch up on me
And this Rollie face a bigger bonus
Hang with the killers homie
Money hungry, getting busy
And the stick up homies
So pick your poison
