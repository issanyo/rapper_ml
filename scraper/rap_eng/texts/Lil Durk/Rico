[Verse 1]
Choppa chopped his ass
Foe nem boxed his ass
On that block with MACs
Niggas drop for MACs
That's a homi nigga
Rondo caught a body nigga
He a still body niggas
Babies in the traphouse
Johnson Johnson nigga
How the fuck you wildin' niggas
Niggas' hoes be robbin' niggas
Kiilas with me from all blocks
All Glocks so call God
And we slidin' no hidin'
You down, you cosign
Fuck him up but his bitch just sucked me up
Late night with them sticks
Hit the city fuck the dicks
High speed I'm with the shits
I can't take another risk
And I'm cool with hearin' shit
I can't take another diss
And I always want a Draco
You can X that off the list
And we slide down yo' block
Hoping niggas that I miss
Boom 'em right back around
Hit up whoever miss
Never put that pole down
I'm from where it go down
Rico!

[Hook]
I seen my homie kill my other homie
We call that nigga Rico
Niggas say they’ll pull the police on me
Watch out for that fuckin' Rico
That Rico, that Rico
That Rico, that Rico
That Rico, that Rico
That Rico

[Verse 2]
Take somethin', from my woes gon' shake somethin'
And my jewels is wraith money
68 back that straight money
Police want me off the streets
Take my kids away from me
See them lawyers never cheap
60k for them to speak
No time for Rico
My homie snaked like Rico
That boy is dead as Kemo
My name ring bells like Jingle
I gotta watch it now
Heard he want the top and shit
Heard he want the block and shit
And my car and watch and shit
And I think he coppin' shit
Not a bird, he cops and shit
I'm a real nigga and that boy the opposite
You gon' have that one homie that's gon' hate on you
He gon' get that bag and take off, ain't gon' wait on you
Gang Gang!

[Hook]
I seen my homie kill my other homie
We call that nigga Rico
Niggas say they’ll pull the police on me
Watch out for that fuckin' Rico
That Rico, that Rico
That Rico, that Rico
That Rico, that Rico
That Rico
