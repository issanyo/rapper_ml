[Intro:]


[Hook]
Fuck all the opp niggas
My niggas pop niggas
Slide through and they drop niggas
No soda, they pop niggas
Fuck niggas don't rock with us
We don't rock with, nobody, nobody
You ain't no killer, you ain't killed nobody
I sip on that lean, ion sit with nobody
When I was locked up, I ain't have nobody
I'm talking bout nobody, nobody


[Verse 1]
Cut up for a check
Why diss, he ain't where I'm at
My block, my city where I'm at
Nobody ever gave me shit
I got this pint of this Act
When niggas ain't never give me shit
My mama struggled tryna borrow a hunnid
To make sure we was with, Never without
You ain't gone show, pussy
Never whip out
25 city tour, off a mixtape
Nigga look at the clout
No shoes to designer, Nigga look at me now
No sleep to a mansion, nigga look at my house
If no one knows, you should know
Pay for guns, pay for lawyers, pay for dues, and funerals
Nobody was in my corner, nobody gave me shit
I had earned it
And I told my gang, I want them
In my corner it was nobody...

[Hook]
Fuck all the opp niggas
My niggas pop niggas
Slide through and they drop niggas
No soda, they pop niggas
Fuck niggas don't rock with us
We don't rock with, nobody, nobody
You ain't no killer, you ain't killed nobody
I sip on that lean, ion sit with nobody
When I was locked up, I ain't have nobody
I'm talking bout nobody, nobody

[verse 2]
30 on me, 50 on me, bape on me, safe on me, trap with me
Wraith on me
Broke boys get away from me
Bad bitches wanna taste on me
Chopper bullets don't play, homie
Let it spray homie
Bitch nigga, today can be your day homie
Lil Durk, bitch im with that
Pussy get kidnapped, Pussy just sit back
5:30 like a kit kat
Dog pound with me
R.I.P Lil Polo shawty
I just pulled of in a Audi
Niggas turn their head doubting m
Before all this rush, bitch savage
Look at my clarity, these diamonds
Ever since I been with shawty, these bitches been eyein' me
The niggas, these bitches, I know they some hoes
I'm riding through Lamron with all of my woes

[Hook]
Fuck all the opp niggas

Fuck niggas don't rock with us
We don't rock with, nobody, nobody
You ain't no killer, you ain't killed nobody
I sip on that lean, ion sit with nobody
When I was locked up, I ain't have nobody
I'm talking bout nobody, nobody
