[Hook]
For my kids, I'll shoot a nigga
Can't name a nigga realer
Man in the system they'll lose them niggas
You a 2015 killer
Man I told you I'm a street nigga
Get money with my street niggas
I ain't never been a leech nigga
Pick up my gun I'm in these streets nigga

[Verse]
Album drop, album hot, 30K Bentley flop
Album number two in the country and they got me high
Yeah cause I canâ€™t depend on these niggas
They sell their soul for weed nigga
Get caught for a body do weeks nigga
When I'm around don't speak nigga
You a leech nigga
Remember them days no sleep nigga
I was in town I just had nowhere to sleep nigga
Mama told me I was gifted
Don't sit on your ass and go get it
Daddy still locked up, boddies still pop up
Renny bring the Glocks up watch him pop roc up
Never went to school, I'm a block nigga
'Fore Bobby I was a hard nigga
Wack a P.O I drop nigga
FN Black were the cop killers
And I've been on my own, never been the type to call niggas
I'ma ball nigga
And they pray on my down fall nigga

[Hook]
For my kids, I'll shoot a nigga
Can't name a nigga realer
Man in the system they'll lose them niggas
You a 2015 killer
Man I told you I'm a street nigga
Get money with my street niggas
I ain't never been a leech nigga
Pick up my gun I'm in these streets nigga
