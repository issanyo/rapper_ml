[Hook: Lil Durk]
Got the street on my conscious
I live to get money
No future
But I am a monster
I live for the drama
The street got me trama
I cannot switch up
I smile for the picture
I do it for the gram no intsa
But it come with the fame
It come with the fame (4x)
Gotta feel my pain
Come with the fame
It come with the fame (4x)
Gotta feel my pain

[Verse 1: Trae Tha Truth]
I'm not going crazy
I been trippin' up lately
I been loosing everything like even Mercedes
All these fuck niggas made me
Going through it I promise you niggas fugazi
But you bitches won't faze me
I'll be strapped and I hit everything but your babies
If you ever betray me
Everyday of my life I been a street nigga
When the shit get worse
You gotta get what you can get before you sit in a hearse
I'm going through hell
I feel like I been hit with a curse
Fuck niggas playin' shady so I I built converse
Time done change
Niggas goin blind to fame
Some other niggas you know try and buy your name
Shit instead of down them they tryna find your lane
I'm in the trap with the backup plan playin' with canes
Solo whip I'm on that solo tip
I keep longer clip for those who wanna trip
And me and Durk together get you niggas flippin'
Have your nigga say your name right out they grip for real
Yea
You don't wanna take it there bitch
I'm with your woman now you yelling ain't no fear bitch
I'm in her head I ain't never in her hair bitch
I miss the price cause the fame I swear bitch

[Hook: Lil Durk]
Got the street on my conscious
I live to get money
No future
But I am a monster
I live for the drama
The street got me trama
I cannot switch up
I smile for the picture
I do it for the gram no insta
But it come with the fame
It come with the fame (4x)
Gotta feel my pain
Come with the fame
It come with the fame (4x)
Gotta feel my pain

[Verse 2: Lil Durk]
Money over all that shit
Imma put fham over all that shit
Whip it up, pack it up, all that shit
Imma fuck the hoe once, never call that bitch
Street niggas stick to the street code
Get the money west coast to the east coast
I be doing the most
But how can I not?
I'm from the city of D. Rose
Can't do the most for my moma
Catchin' plenty bodies, no opp
Me and my bother countin' up these commas
With this canon I feel drama
And it started with niggas, ended children
Sippin' on lean, I hang with my feelings
Choppers on choppers, I post on my block
But police be killing me
I started with nothing so I can't do for free
Ain't a blood, I do still bleed
I'm from the Chi, we'll kill your chief
War with us man it ain't no peace
Niggas tweet, can't live without peace
And I love that beef, and I am the streets

[Hook: Lil Durk]
Got the street on my conscious
I live to get money
No future
But I am a monster
I live for the drama
The street got me trama
I cannot switch up
I smile for the picture
I do it for the gram no intsa
But it come with the fame
It come with the fame (4x)
Gotta feel my pain
Come with the fame
It come with the fame (4x)
Gotta feel my pain

[Outro: Lil Durk]
Street on my conscious
Money, aye
I'm a monster, for the drama
I can't, for the picture
Drug, drug, drug, drug, drug
Let's get it
