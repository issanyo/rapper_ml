[Intro]
"I feel good but I really came from nothing I came from the struggle I came from the gutter, you know what I'm sayin'? I came from a house of four, plus my momma and my grandmomma, no daddy you know what I'm sayin' daddy been gone so I ain't really have no choice but to be the man. I've been running the streets since I was 12, 13 years old. You know what I'm sayin' sellin' drugs, you know what I'm sayin' shootouts. I'm thinkin' it's like a good thing, but I'm stressing my momma, my grandmomma out so I ain't really have no choice but to move my family up out the hood, I ain't have no choice to leave Chicago and move to the A and get my own crib. 6, 7 bedrooms, you know what I'm sayin' mini mansion like it feel good to even start like that man. I ain't have no choic, went to jail 3, 4 times and had major setbacks. Get out of jail, it's a whole new wave. Every time, get out second time, it's a whole new wave so I ain't really have a chance but to really like catch up, you know what I'm sayin'? Give y'all this story, you know what I'm sayin' and I feel like by the end of the day, I gotta come out on top, you know what I'm sayin' 'cause all odds is against me, you know what I'm sayin'? Shit, I ain't really have no choice but to feed the streets."
Love songs for the streets you know?
Ay, when I picked the name they probably thought it was gonna be some R&B shit you know?
Nah, I'ma just let it talk for real
Let's get it!

[Hook]
I promise 2017 I'ma be the best boy
Can't fall, I gotta prevail can't be like the rest of 'em
I took my city by storm I never asked for it
I'm with the hustlers, them murderers and with them trap boys
I ain't have no choice
Hungry on them corners
I ain't have no choice
Young nigga with them birds
I ain't have no choice
Out here with them hustlers
I ain't have no choice, ay
I ain't have no choice, ay
(Let's get it!)

[Verse 1]
I'm from the slum, hopin' to see some better days
That low income, being less for the section 8
Say what you want, makin' sure that my family straight
One hit song, call the people want 100k
Give me yo' pint and I'm bustin' it, we tried to finesse a nigga
Sippin' these medicine, I'm tired of the stressin'
I be really sittin' back thinkin' niggas fuck with me yeah I'm guessin' it
It's indefinite
I got a question in it
You can't relate to my music, I don't want yo' credit
Left my city I'm went to yours, 'cause I gotta get it
I'm a savage with fashion, this is not a gimmick
I come from low-income I tell 'em I'm a menace
(Let's get it!)

[Hook]
I promise 2017 I'ma be the best boy
Can't fall, I gotta prevail can't be like the rest of 'em
I took my city by storm I never asked for it
I'm with the hustlers, them murderers and with them trap boys
I ain't have no choice
Hungry on them corners
I ain't have no choice
Young nigga with them birds
I ain't have no choice
Out here with them hustlers
I ain't have no choice, ay
I ain't have no choice, ay
(Let's get it!)

[Verse 2]
I love my sister to death her love ain't got no limit
She say I got rich and left, she say I'm actin' different
She said say no to them drugs, them 30s got me trippin'
She say don't never sacrifice I told her that's for publicity
I'm from the pound originally, I started singin' they mimic me
How you gon' kill  her, you jittery
Nuski's killer had his misery
I had 10 cases in felony of Chicago 'cause I was holdin' a .40
I've been snaked up by my own family, I've been tryin' to avoid it
(Let's get it)
Shit they better pray for me
Tell my momma it ain't safe for me
Bitch nigga get away from me
Kill anybody got no sympathy

[Hook]
I promise 2017 I'ma be the best boy
Can't fall, I gotta prevail can't be like the rest of 'em
I took my city by storm I never asked for it
I'm with the hustlers, them murderers and with them trap boys
I ain't have no choice
Hungry on them corners
I ain't have no choice
Young nigga with them birds
I ain't have no choice
Out here with them hustlers
I ain't have no choice, ay
I ain't have no choice, ay
(Let's get it!)
