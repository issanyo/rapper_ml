[Verse]
Mama raised me DOLO, all I know is YOLO
I came from USPA to rockin' regular Polo
TEC-9's to JoJo's, to bezels that got four rolls
Hoppin' out of four doors, shoot up a party ASAP
Hated schools stay strapped
I can't say I hate rap
Nights I had to play that
Just so I'd have somewhere to lay at
2 sisters, 1 brother, 4 empty rooms, no cover
[?] car cut short, she sold it for some G money
I'm here everyday with my niggas claimin' 300
Jam lock, Tim lock, Law Lock, 40 lock
More ops and more op thats why I can't keep my 40 Glock
Felon below [?]
But I carry anyway
Learn lesson, learn life
Realest them have shot at me
Snitchin' didn't apply to me
Kept it closed happily
[?] doin' good, [?] doin good
Twin totin' on parole he still in the hood
[?] sayin' since day one still up to no good
Nuski got the strap still will burn you like some wood
My daddy went down for the set we beef with now
I respect my hundred grand but I'm in the streets now
My motto is my motto i'm playin' for keeps now
Its body for a body
You send shots we send em back
Time for my first case, your lady got sent back
They say I'm startin' violence, say I'm promotin' violence
They talked about Jesus so, me I kept it quiet
The jungle with the snakes, I see threats but I'm a lion
These real rap niggas rap real but they be lyin'
And Imma keep it 300
