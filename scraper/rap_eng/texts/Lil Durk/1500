[Intro: Lil Durk]
Shoutout to my brother Reesey money man
You know how the fuck we rockin' man
Back on that vulture shit

[Hook: Lil Durk]
What I spent on these diamonds? Cost me 1500s
I just bought some Margielas for like 1500
I just bought me a FN for like 1300
And I spent on these Balmains like 1500
Don't wanna smoke yo' weed I'm just bein' honest
A bitch just sucked my dick she look just like Rihanna
Posted in the trap with robber scammers
You get shot up in yo' shit you talkin' jibber-jabber

[Verse 1: Lil Reese]
You get shot up in yo' shit you talkin' jibber-jabber
Rollin' with me best believe my boys totin' hammers
I hang with the killers even, I hang with the scammers
Slide on yo' block, best believe my windows tinted
So a fuck nigga can't really see who in it
Reesey and his niggas, best believe they really in it
I just missed a call it's yo' bitch she say it's been a minute
Ever since a young boy bet you've know we been some menace
Pull up, ain't no missin', you get caught ain't no snitchin'
Tryna turn nothin' into somethin', you say I'm on a mission
Gotta turn nothin' into somethin', you say I fuckin' did it
All these big face Benjis, Benji money spendin'

[Verse 2: Lil Durk]
Ay, I just chugged some lean in my baby bottle
Ay, smokin' on some weed, roll up some gelato
40 auto, roll me you'd better deck a taco
You ain't never sit inside a Tahoe
Tellin' me, you ain't on your block though
Slide on 'em, still invade if that nigga say they smoke a Chino
Catch a 15, Tim Tebow, put this FN on his (?)
1500 thousand on this choker chains
Killa say AP you can see the brains
You only see me with these easy chains
So many Glocks around me like I'm with the Glizzy gang
I spent 1500 dollars on these denim jeans
I spent 40 thousand dollars on these tennis things
And they Chanel! (Let's get it!)
