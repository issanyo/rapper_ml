[Verse 2: Lil Reese]
My niggas they killas and they some jack boys
Don’t call my phone for a feature, I text you know it
Stalking bitch up on my line

Ridin’ round with the slammer
I’m never paranoid
On papers and I still tote that
You know it

And we ain't paranoid
If you up it and you got it
Then you bout to blow it
And we don't fall out for no bitches
Cuz they all goin'

For my jack boys
Threw them fifties and them hundreds
Where my jack boys

But ayy, Lil Durk What's up with them shootas
