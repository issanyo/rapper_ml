[Intro]
Gang, squad
Ain't gon' lie, I'm squad and I'm gang, they the same thing, feel me?
King of Chicago once again, shout out Sosa
Remember My Name, pussy
Gang, gang
Nigga we ain't goin'
I just made 200 off tourin'
Bang, bang, bang
Bang, nigga, bang, gang, nigga, bang

[Verse 1]
I'm an OTF boy recruit
Finna pull up to the zoo, nigga
Loose nigga, free my nigga Zoo, he a loose screw
Shoot nigga, we don't give a fuck, who is you, nigga?
Food nigga, run up on Durk, he gon' lose, nigga
Aye, 3K on the shoe, ho
Pussy nigga softer than some NuVo
I just took his brain, faneto
I just hit a stain, faneto
Aye, aye, aye, gang, gang, gang, aye, aye, faneto
World around, they say they snatchin' Lil Durk's chain
I be on Normal with 30's yellin' gang
Bitch I terrify my city, nothin' changed (what you want?)
Twitter niggas throwin' emojis by my name
Bitch I'm ridin' through the opps
Finna go and shoot Young Money up
Grease my trigger finger, it ain't stuck
I just told Kendall Jenner, can I fuck?
Ain't no gang like my gang and they know
South By SouthWest, I ain't goin' (Worldstar)
Hit the stage with Meek Milly at his show (in Philly)
He got Nicki , I just want me Dej Loaf
Th-thirty on me, steady bumpin' at the opps
Niggas hate I got my city shit on lock (Chiraq)
I don't like Rugers, I like Glocks
Niggas mad I'm steady screamin', "Free my pops"
We gon' take some down, Faneto Gang
I just told my lawyer, "Beat that case" (He beat that case)
Call all the promoters, I need that change
Run up on his ass, I need that face

[Outro]
Gang in this bitch
We snatchin' chains in this bitch
Shout out Sosa, man, shout out to the whole 300 movement
May 12th, Remember My Name, the album droppin' man
You know, they know I'm on this shit
I'ma fuck somethin' up, man
Take something down gang
OTF gang, 300 gang, OBLOCK
Hit a stain, faneto
Aye this my city, nigga
Ain't any competition
