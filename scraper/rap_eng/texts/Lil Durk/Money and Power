[Hook]
Money and power, thats the only religion
Pray to god that we make it, hit da streets and go get it
I want it all Yeah, I want it allll yeah (2x)


[Verse 1]
Money and Power, thats just part of ma niggas
Rest in peace to J-money, we living life to we end it
My religion is true, but i just cop me some robbins
Niggas switch up on they niggas to tha niggas that's poppin
I give life to my kids, daddy gave life to tha pigs
Only reason niggas out they gave advice to the feds
(I want it all all all all, yeah, i just want it all all all all yeah)
Dreads don't make you Haitian, Guess you don't cuss you a christian
Niggas die for attention, I pray to god for ma niggas
Some believe in the devil, tha luminati' got levels
Niggas givin up they family for some cribs and some bezels
Niggas change under pressure, two gun cases can't tell'em
I can tell niggas tattle i lost my bro to the battle yeah
(I want it all all all all, yeah, i just want it all)

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
I seen alot of niggas, go on dat stand pointing fingers
Told ma mama I love her, and salute who don't believe us (nah)
Niggas claim we they brothers and they right here when we need em
But I went through the trauma and seen nobody but Jesus
Got caught up by tha life, I got brought up by tha pipes
Now these niggas takin credit 4 what we did all dem nights (I had it all all all) Age of 16 had a ball, want it all I got it all
In the streets I took a lost, Gunshots ring off them blockas
These niggas mad dey can't stop us
Everywhere you go these niggas know we the topic
All black hoodie no gothic, dey dreaded up like dey shottas (squad)
But we watchin who watchin, dem niggas saying dey got us
I can't trust these niggas, I can't fuck with these niggas
I got up on these niggas, and Ima up on these niggas
(I want it all all all yeah i just want it all, all
Yeahhh yeahh)
