(Verse 1:Lil Ray Ray)

Lil Ray Ray On The Beat I Like To Spazz Out
Check After Check I Like To Cashout, Growing Up In The Streets
Was A Challenge,But Now That Up Now I’m Rocking Patek

(Chorus: Lil Durk)
Baby when I smash you, put your back in it  Get that first nut, then I'm back in it  Can you go deep? you keep asking it  Don't take a whole perc, she want half of it  Drug sex, drug sex, yeah yeah  Rich sex, rich sex, yeah yeah  I know you nasty  She be touchin' on her own body, Don't like no outside bitch, I like a home body

(Verse 2:Lil Mear)
Lil Mear yea I like em nastyyy, Yeaaaa I like Them homebody’s,The type that be touching on they own body,But I can’t wife if she got 5 bodies, Swerving lanes in that new mazi, Big Pimp Like I’m John Gotti, VVS in my ear so I’m feeling cocky, Spanish ting yea she call me Papi, Yea I like them homebodies
