[Intro: Doughboy & Lil Durk]
Carter in this bitch, now I feel like Nino
(Free Numba 9 bitch, RIP LA, gang)

[Pre-Hook: Doughboy]
40 on my neck, now I'm the hood hero
We shooting bricks like we shooting a free throw
Everything my way I swear I feel like Lito
Carter in this bitch, now I feel like Nino

[Hook: Doughboy]
All I ever wanted was a kilo (x4)

[Verse 1: Doughboy]
King up in this bitch, I'm the hood hero
Got a couple thousand, we came up from zero
He front me what I'm buying so shout out to migo
He load up the plane and come in from Toledo
Rubber band that money I'm in love with C-notes
Them bitches flock our section everywhere that we go
Cuz we popping yeah, young thousandaires
And all I wanted was a kilo
Drugs had mama gone, she was never there
That gave me free time to get my clientele
We eyeball that work, no we don't need a scale
Unless it's the one they use to weigh them whales

[Pre-Hook: Doughboy]
40 on my neck, now I'm the hood hero
We shooting bricks like we shooting a free throw
Everything my way I swear I feel like Lito
Carter in this bitch, now I feel like Nino

[Hook: Doughboy]
All I ever wanted was a kilo (x4)

[Verse 2: Lil Durk]
Bricks and birds
Catch a opp, he switch his words
50 on me, boy don't run
Shots go off, he send that word
On that corner, me and Berg
We did dirt all on that curb
Man this bitch get on my nerves
Sit back bitch and pop a perc
Kilos from Pedro, I'm like Debo with kilos
Stash spot for the drugs, LA trip, meet the migo
I'ma boul like Beanie, but in the streets I'm like Sigel
Rondo coming home the judge want him to do 5 plus 0
We got 4-5 bodies, for the opps killing Chino
Selling dope, El Chapo locked up so we selling soap
Free my killas, them my killas
All my niggas they some goons
Only niggas in the field, only niggas that ain't told
(Gang, gang)

[Pre-Hook: Doughboy]
40 on my neck, now I'm the hood hero
We shooting bricks like we shooting a free throw
Everything my way I swear I feel like Lito
Carter in this bitch, now I feel like Nino
