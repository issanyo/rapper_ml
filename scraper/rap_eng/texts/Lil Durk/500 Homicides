[Intro]
Oh! These niggas ain't gangstas
Stay tryna take my lil homie off the streets huh
Free 'Nine bitch!
We still got real niggas out here (so everybody gangsta now huh?)
Where you from nigga?
Free the guys man, you ain't from where we from
I told my niggas we gon' make it man
It's a fucking movement man
We a fucking family, we ain't a gang
OTF (Squad)

[Verse 1]
These niggas is bitches, getting info from bitches
Go and tell to the piggies
I'm tryna get riches, and stay on that business
Free bro, niggas snitching
My case almost over, you lucky one pending
I put 2 in his lemon, this 4-5 a lemon
Extended clip for his niggas
And he ain't shit to his niggas
We don't hesitate, from DeeDee and BayBay just know that the opps ain't never safe
Load up the Glock, and reload the 8
Do a drill on the op, no clones I see dots
ACG's, Free the Guys shirt, and one pair of rocks
I'm on the block
Hope my tape don't flop, and it go gold when it drop
I'm not a liar, start D'ing them baggies, and we risking indictment
Just to get flier than a first class ticket, United
300, O'block
Murder murder, kill kill, in the jam I'll never squeal
My label only time I deal
I fuck with G's, B's, Moes, Kings,  Snakes, 4's and the niggas under Neal
Silver spoon, you don't know how hunger feel
Dreaming 'bout 100 mil, step on that curb with 100 pills
Western Union money to bro and them, in the cell doing 20 years
And I lost a couple of these niggas, and they ain't never seen 20 years, oh
Bro died when I was out of town, shit happened Iâ€™m not around
Slide through every opp block and we up shots till they not around
What's up with this twitter beef?
Thought we was keepin' it in the streets?
They mad I'm in the winner seat, from the summer time 'till winter breeze
And choppa squeeze, bitch go blaat, blaat, blaat!
I ain't even gotta rap, (rap, rap) Rex nem in the trap (trap, trap)
One time no light bulb, bro n em got a lamp, (lamp, lamp)
Where you from you ain't stamped (stamp, stamp)
Niggas know we the champ (champ, champ)
Got niggas sneak dissin', it ain't rap
Make a real nigga gotta spit facts
Got some niggas saying keep it only rap
That's how these old niggas stay on the map
Headshot, we ain't getting into that
Niggas tellin' hands full of pens and pads
Grab a pack, blood bleeding real bad
Doin' hit in a coupe, in a Range, or an Audi
Fuck a nigga doubt me
All on my dick when they see me
Knowing this bitch wanna be me
Hell yea you can die over a retweet
I'm grabbing my pole on mimi
I can't see a nigga like Stevie
I won't tell, I'll take me a BG
Let's get it!
GANG!
