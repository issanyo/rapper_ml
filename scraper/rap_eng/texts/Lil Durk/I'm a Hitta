I'm a hitta by myself
I'm a hitta by myself
I don't need nobody hit it
I'm a hitta by myself
I'm a hitta by myself
I'm a hitta by myself
I don't need nobody hit it

[Verse 1: Lil durk]
Niggas think I'm swisher sweet
Kush cologne, I think I reek
You're bitch said she B.I.E
So I give her dick and bye
K.I.N.G. Lil Durk why
P.O.L.O Lil Durk fly
50 of that, bro I'm high
Man you know that kush (Kush)
They be hatin'
They be fakin'
In my face like Durk whats crackin'
Bro whats happenin'
They be actin'
Go and tell they mans I'm lackin'
I'm 2-4 so ain't no stackin'
But you know I'm stackin' cheese
Bro you know I'm jammin' jammin'
Goin' hammage on these beats
Niggas know Lil Durk the truth
He hang with shooters in a booth
You won't breathe you're killed like movies
Ayay filled wit' [?]
Niggas know 'bout Lamron shootin'
Check the news channel Two
B.O.D.Y.B.A.G body bag these bitches too
Man I got a small circle
But I know a lotta niggas, lotta killas
Dem my hittas, go and put that bag on niggas
Go and put that Glad on niggas
Broski told me trash them niggas
Niggas said they fuck wit, me
But I be lookin' past them niggas
L's

[Verse 2: Lil Durk]
I do bad all by myself
I don't need no nigga help
You ain't felt what I done felt
Some days I feel always wrong
Why must you break into homes
Do it cause I'm on my own
Can't do shit when daddy gone
Even tho' he in the room
Grew up in this grass of snakes
Man collude so ain't no way
He's still fake, She's still fake
I don't know how much to take
I don't know how much to take
Lil Durk on first 48
You don't ain't got shit to say
But you know I'm talkin' shit
Half these niggas, they don't know me (don't know me)
Half these niggas, they be phony (they be phony)
One minute they call me lame
Next minute they call me broski
Half these niggas, they don't know me
(Half these niggas, they don't know me)
Half these niggas, they be phony
(Half these niggas, they be phony)
One minute they call me lame
(One minute they call me lame)
Next minute they call me broski
(Next minute they call me broski)

[Chorus]
I'm a hitta by myself
I'm a hitta by myself
I'm a hitta by myself
I don't need nobody hit it
I'm a hitta by myself
I'm a hitta by myself
I'm a hitta by myself
I don't need nobody hit it
I'm a hitta by myself
I'm a hitta by myself
I'm a hitta by myself
I don't need nobody hit it
