[Intro: Lil Durk]
Gang
Let's Get It!

[Hook: Moneybagg Yo]
I was just starving in them apartments, that shit feel like yesterday
I was just going to sleep on some carpet, that shit feel like yesterday
I my ran bands up and no I'm not sorry, same feeling like yesterday
Niggas saying they gon' rob me, I heard the same shit yesterday
I was just starving in them apartments, that shit feel like yesterday
I was just going to sleep on some carpet, that shit feel like yesterday
I my ran bands up and no I'm not sorry, same feeling like yesterday
Niggas saying they gon' rob me, I heard the same shit yesterday

[Verse 1: Moneybagg Yo]
I was starving in them MillCreek Apartments, shit got me heartless
Rent time, laying low I was dodging, I was having money problems
Sipping lean pouring up like a faucet, baby momma Trying to argue
Telling me how she hoping I don't get farther, she can't except that I'm popping
I came up they say I'm a target
Talking bout how they gone rob me
I keep them blue tips in my cartridge
A nigga try me then I'm popping
Yesterday hopped out a foreign and I couldn't believe it
Took my backend and cashed out on a couple piece
Niggas be talking that shit need to tell them please (shhhh)
I might just shoot em and fly to another region
I got some niggas that's locked away, I got niggas in a better place
I bust down a Rollie from 50k
I really did that shit yesterday
I been in these streets running with them gangstas, I ain't just start this shit yesterday
OTF, CMG, Breadgang we got them feeling some type of way

[Verse 2: Lil Durk]
Ain't get the rep before last and it's not 'cause of the cash
Hundred pounds of the gas, we took it the day before last
My homie got 39 years because he ain't put on a mask
Because you snitched in the past, don't mean we won't get on yo ass
My baby momma told me I'm a dead beat
Opps see me said he ain't sparing me
Credit card fraud money handy
Ain't nobody here licensed to carry
20 years if I go and carry
Bitch nigga I ain't never scary
I'm in the trenches I ain't never scary
I counted 400 G's and the Glock was on me that was yesterday
And I'm addicted to lean and I be all in the streets that was yesterday
So niggas bet not play with me, OG be with me and shawty don't hesistate
Pop me a perc and you meditate, shawtyâ€™ll send you through heaven gates
