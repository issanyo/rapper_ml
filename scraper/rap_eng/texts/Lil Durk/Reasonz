[Intro: Derez De'Shon]
Derez De’Shon

[Chorus: Derez De'Shon]
Neck on freezer (Neck on freezer)
Pockets on cheeses (Pockets on cheese)
I got a clip and a drum
I got my reasons (I got my reasons)
He say he bat, he say he slatt
And I believe him (I swear I believe him)
I keep a youngin with a youngin
I got my reasons (I got my reasons)
You say you love me, you say you ridin'
I gotta see it (I gotta see it)
So hard to love, so hard to trust
I got my reasons (I got my reasons)
Put in some work, go do some dirt
Make me believe (Make me believe)
This shit ain’t easy (This shit ain't easy)
'Cause I got my reasons (Yeah yeah)

[Verse 1: Derez De'Shon]
Yeah, big face Rollie on me and a clip hangin' on my hip (Don't do it)
Please don't trip (Don't do it)
Fuck around, get your kinfolk flipped (Rrah)
Quarter million dollars worth of drip
Hangin’ ’round my neck, can't ego trip (Uh-uh)
Ballin’ with a eurostep
Fly fat nigga, you ain't seen this drip (Bend over)
Since all the fame, a lot of shit changed
It's different with me and my partners
Since all the change, they look at me strange
I feel like they watchin' to rob me
I can’t trust a thing so I keep a flame
I never know who out here plottin'
Step right in your face, start talkin' crazy
And you ain't do nothin' about it
I put it all on the line so many times (So many times)
I wanna see if you gon' ride for me (I wanna know), die for me
You said you love me, but you been lyin' to me (Derez De'Shon)

[Chorus: Derez De'Shon]
Neck on freezer (Neck on freezer)
Pockets on cheeses (Pockets on cheese)
I got a clip and a drum
I got my reasons (I got my reasons)
He say he bat, he say he slatt
And I believe him (I swear I believe him)
I keep a youngin with a youngin
I got my reasons (I got my reasons)
You say you love me, you say you ridin'
I gotta see it (I gotta see it)
So hard to love, so hard to trust
I got my reasons (I got my reasons)
Put in some work, go do some dirt
Make me believe (Make me believe)
This shit ain't easy (This shit ain't easy)
'Cause I got my reasons (Yeah yeah)

[Verse 2: Lil Durk]
This shit not easy, it's medium
Niggas do love you but you is not feedin' them, yeah
I was with you, you was regular
Way before you was drivin' in premium, yeah
Streets made me lose my mind
I cannot waste my time
I was always frontline
You cannot play with my life
Killers on you, same night, ooh
I can't trust your guys
I'ma tell the truth, not lie
A fuck nigga stole my pipe
Off them drugs, I ain't care as long as I had my pint (Lean)
I really be slidin' with killers
And I'm rich, it ain't addin' up
They don't know that I love 'em through the low
I don't know if they can handle the truth
You gave the police the scoop, like damn, what you do?
Roxy, Oxycontin, that's your new
Plottin', watchin' me, you gon' lose

[Chorus: Derez De'Shon]
Neck on freezer (Neck on freezer)
Pockets on cheeses (Pockets on cheese)
I got a clip and a drum
I got my reasons (I got my reasons)
He say he bat, he say he slatt
And I believe him (I swear I believe him)
I keep a youngin with a youngin
I got my reasons (I got my reasons)
You say you love me, you say you ridin'
I gotta see it (I gotta see it)
So hard to love, so hard to trust
I got my reasons (I got my reasons)
Put in some work, go do some dirt
Make me believe (Make me believe)
This shit ain't easy (This shit ain't easy)
'Cause I got my reasons (Yeah yeah)

[Outro: Derez De'Shon]
I wanna know
That shit hard, hahaha
