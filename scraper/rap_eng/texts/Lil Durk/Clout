[Hook]

[Verse 3: Prince Snoop]
Smoke a lot of dope sip a lot of lean

Just a young nigga with a lot of clout
We broke borders they talking about
It's obvious they don't know what they talking about
All this fucking clout I got your mans mad
True Religion denims got my pants sagging
Them niggas got that swag that I been had
Finessing get a check and then I spend that

[Hook]
