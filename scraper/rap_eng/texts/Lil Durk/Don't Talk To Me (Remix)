[Post-Chorus: Lil Durk]
I can't get enough of it, all of this jealousy
I had a petty bitch, you can do better things
Smoke gas, kerosene, three roll, wedding ring
In my DM meddlin', off the X, that ecstasy

[Verse 1: Lil Durk]
Seven hundred for the Vetements, I'm a boss, not a gentleman
All my hoes intelligent, can't set me up, Tori Brixx
I like my bitches lit, I spend a bag of checks
Ecstasy, Tesla, Amiri jeans fetish
Look at my world, let's get in to it, look at this lean, addicted to it
While he off the leaf, embalming fluid, shoppin' spree, I overdo it, yeah
Stick talk stick talk (Chick chick, bang), sneak diss, this stick talk (Chick chick, bang)
I don't talk, just stick talk (Chick chick, bang), I'm with niggas that stick talk (Brrah)
Go to Europe to get all the euros, yes sir, designer apparel
Chapo, need to find the heroin, broke bitch, that vibe'll kill you

[Chorus: Lil Durk]
Just don't talk to me (Just don't talk to me)
Just don't talk to me (Just don't talk to me)
Just don't talk to me (Just don't talk to me)
Just don't talk to me (Just don't talk to me)
Just don't talk to me (Just don't talk to me)
Just don't talk to me (Just don't talk to me)
Just don't talk to me (Just don't talk to me)
Just don't talk to me (Just don't talk to me)

[Post-Chorus: Lil Durk]
I can't get enough of it, all of this jealousy
I had a petty bitch, you can do better things
Smoke gas, kerosene, three roll, wedding ring
In my DM meddlin', off the X, that ecstasy

[Verse 3: Juice WRLD]
Dunk on a bitch like John Wall, codeine, no Cristal
Bomb on a bitch like Chris Paul, made money, I'm pissed off
Your bitch gave me a blowjob, and you kissed her
I just been runnin' the dough up, early the money, no hold up
Codeine my cup, ain't no Folgers, she crack that shit like a soldier
I sell rock to your momma, rockstar, whippin' the rock up
He say he gon' pull up, he don't want no drama, mobbin' with them shooters
Get to the cake, no birthday, I overlap these niggas, first place
Shoot a fuck nigga in the air with a AK
Should've never been around here in the first place
These .50 cal, earthquake, run up a check like, wow, relay
I'm on top right now, gettin' top from a thot, can't talk right now

[Chorus: Lil Durk]
