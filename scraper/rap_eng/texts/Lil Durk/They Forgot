[Intro]
Gang! Gang!
We started this shit nigga, they know
Niggas cross me, they know
Talkin' I ain't did shit for 'em, they know
Pussy niggas, I cut 'em off, bitch
Gang! Gang!

[Chorus]
I just brought some MACs and shit, couple killers is after me
Got the city all on gang dick, they used to laugh at me
Had to cut a couple niggas off, and now they mad at me
Had to blow a bag on designer, I'm in the fashion scene
Mini chopper that Draco catchin' me lackin' me
Randy give him two shots to his face, 'cause he lied to me
Rest in peace my homies, I feel like them niggas died for me
You ain't no street nigga
You ain't no street nigga

[Verse 1]
Bitch nigga
And I gave 'em cash, I'm a rich nigga
Before I got this fame I kept a stick nigga
And I fuck his bitch, I gave her dick nigga
Now tell 'em every reason why you sick nigga
And I'm the reason why you got them bricks nigga
Sneak dissin', catch him by himself, ain't got a stick with him
100 thousand jewels, I cop my lil' bitch a mink nigga
Would say I hope you OD but I don't jinx
Pussy boy, telling everything to the pigs nigga
Talkin' 'bout I don't do shit for the fam, bitch I'm from the Lam
100 here, 100 thou'
Free my niggas out the jail
I'll never rat
50K, I drop it out the sac
Bike life
Slide on that Banchee, on lil' Meek's ass
Nightlife
Slide to his crib, I'ma creep his ass
Left, right
3, 4 times, I'll beat his ass
If came with us, I swear to God we'll leave his ass

[Chorus]
I just brought some MACs and shit, couple killers is after me
Got the city all on gang dick, they used to laugh at me
Had to cut a couple niggas off, and now they mad at me
Had to blow a bag on designer, I'm in the fashion scene
Mini chopper that Draco catchin' me lackin' me
Randy give him two shots to his face, 'cause he lied to me
Rest in peace my homies, I feel like them niggas died for me
You ain't no street nigga
You ain't no street nigga

[Verse 2]
Niggas say Chicago ain't mine, them niggas  lyin'
Think about fuckin' with mine, them niggas dyin'
Future got me poppin' a Perc, I took a few a slime
Free the guys doin' real time, 22 and 9
Even though they want 1,000 pennies, niggas won't drop a dime
They know we fuckin' hoes in the city
Fuck 'em once and never call a bitch back
I'm that nigga, follow who?
Only time I follow niggas are for Twitter
Watch this shit, go and get my own
With no asking shit
Past this shit, classic shit
I might fuck a ratchet bitch
Bitch I'm me, I can't fuck for free
30K to see
Bitches sleep, got 'em mad at me
People hated me
Super sauce, I'm a super boss
Killas super off
Niggas hoes, niggas super salty
And I got designer, Loubs and all
Niggas straight snitches, just to lose 'em all
Nigga what, nigga who is y'all
Bernie take 'em off!
Gang! Gang!

[Chorus]
I just brought some MACs and shit, couple killers is after me
Got the city all on gang dick, they used to laugh at me
Had to cut a couple niggas off, and now they mad at me
Had to blow a bag on designer, I'm in the fashion scene
Mini chopper that Draco catchin' me lackin' me
Randy give him two shots to his face, 'cause he lied to me
Rest in peace my homies, I feel like them niggas died for me
You ain't no street nigga
You ain't no street nigga
