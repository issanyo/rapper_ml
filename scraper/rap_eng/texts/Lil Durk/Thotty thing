I don't love these hoes, but I love a thotty girl
Let us billy jean, tell her baby its your world
Rolling off a flat, but her ass non flat
Any flack is fat when we juicy throw it back
Smokin loud pack, champagne on ice
She know I'm the shit but she said it's alright
Bring her friend with her, I ain't fuckin all night
She a thot to should have called her thot twice
She got long hair so I pull it when we do it
When she come she squirt and I love to make her do it
I know she a thot
But right now she lookin boo-ish
And I'm off the shit so I might be talking foolish
