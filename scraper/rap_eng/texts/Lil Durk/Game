[Intro]
Know I'm in this motherfucker with all members in this bitch
You know?
We on our OTF shit, ya heard?
Helluva made this beat, baby
King Von, know what I'm sayin'?
Got Sada on this motherfucker
Booka, man
Know what I'm sayin'?

[Verse 1: Lil Durk]
I counted bloody money with my Loubs on (Loubs on)
I came a long way from a futon (Futon)
My uncle caught a body, got an elbow (Elbow)
I'm only listenin' to the gang inside my headphones (Yeah)
And I took you back when you was dead wrong
I lost my cousin to cold blood, I keep my head strong (Head strong)
You can't trade the gang, we know that you told
Graduations to funerals
Ecstasy opened my pupils
Bustdown Patek, got three Rolls
You ever seen four killas in a two-door?
Durk ridin' with his people
I'm the heart of my city and I ride with Tee Grizzley, In my DM talkin' to Nicki
A hundred bands, you make the news
'Cause you know I cannot lose
'Cause I know they tryna get me

[Verse 2: Sada Baby]
Sing to your bitch, still'll murk a nigga
Yeah I sing, still'll hurt you, just like Durk and them
Drop your top like Ice Cube in his first film
I was stompin' niggas out in my first Timbs
Got your girl with me, trappin' 'til the boy gone
She gon' suck dick and chew kids 'til her voice gone
Four-five give him body shots like Roy Jones
Foreign whip with the tinted windows, pull a drum out it
Pull up to your baby mama's house, knock your son out it
When the opps don't shoot back, it take the fun out it
Them niggas gon' miss, I don't miss, I knock blood out you
Booka say you can't touch me or it's hammer time
I can't get caught with no straps or it's slammer time
Quadruple cup of good syrup like Aunt Jemim'
Load up my chopsticks, I'ma take my time
I'ma kill a nigga if I want to, it ain't no crime, huh

[Verse 3: Tee Grizzley & YNW Melly]
Told that lil' bitch, "Don't suck me up if you ain't catchin' it'" (Don't)
Took a whole hour just to count up all the Jeffersons
Everybody rich and shoot that bitch but we ain't Steph and them
He text his wife like, "I'm fuckin' you up if you just left with him"
Killers on retainers like defense attorneys
They gon' slide with them cutters, you won't live through the surgery
Pop a bean, do a bad bitch dirty (Bitch, shut up)
She like, "Boy, you almost murked me, you can't fuck me off them Perkies"
Get that work out just like burpees, play with me, savages lurking
I don't play bitch, I be working, you can't ride the wave, no surfing
In the hood passin' out turkeys
Don't waste your time sendin' threats, we not worried (We ain't worried)

[Verse 4: YNW Melly]
Let your mama wear your shirt, fuck nigga
Let your daddy wear your shirt, fuck nigga
I got some niggas who all really steppin' with us
You niggas really wasn't creepin' in them bushes
I'ma fuck her first, then Durk gon' fuck her second
Grizzley gettin' last 'cause we too fuckin' reckless
And I got a bad ho and she keep on textin'
Me that she want me, her nigga tryna test me
Diamonds on my neck and they shinin'
Where the fuck was you when I was grindin'?
Wait, bitch, I'm still grindin'
He got the bustdown, perfect timin'
I got the lil' freaky ho whinin'
G shine, I shine and you shinin'
See you wanna fuck me 'cause we poppin'
I'ma up the bitch and bust, no options
Oh Lord, I got bitches, I got options
Pop a Xan, hit a nigga, bust his noggin, no cap
