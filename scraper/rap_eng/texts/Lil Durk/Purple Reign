[Chorus]
Purple rain, purple rain, go away
Tired of pain and the struggle feeling, go away
Nowadays, I know some people tired of minimum wage
Nowadays, know some people try to copy the wave
Off these drugs, tryna kick my ways
Lemonade, some of these niggas is Minute Maid
Ain't have no game, remember them hoes used to play
Remember them hoes used to play

[Verse 1]
Thirty-shot Glock, no crate box
And I used to sleep in the basement
Learned my religion, I prayed hard
Took that nigga to the graveyard
Can't treat my city like spades, we not playin' cards
Stop that car at a red light, it don't stay in park
My homie took that charge, young niggas all in charge
I like my money as large, drivin' my car, look up and see stars
Got the plug from OKC, truck smellin' like far
Come on, tryna traffic all the drugs, shawty, you gotta be smart
Dumbo jumbo, all my money be jumbo
Like my life got jumbo, like my life got jumbo
At my granny house eatin' gumbo
Caught me with the Perks, need one more
Another one, another one, another gun, another son
Another hit, another run, another hoe, another bum
Ooh, them coke kis, that's ice cold
You didn't have the street, now you ice cold
Cuban link, ring that's white gold
Real street nigga, no typo
Opposition want me off these streets

[Chorus]
Purple rain, purple rain, go away
Tired of pain and the struggle feeling, go away
Nowadays, I know some people tired of minimum wage
Nowadays, know some people try to copy the wave
Off these drugs, tryna kick my ways
Lemonade, some of these niggas is Minute Maid
Ain't have no game, remember them hoes used to play
Remember them hoes used to play

[Verse 2]
While these niggas be baggin'
Run 'em in the basement, buy again
Run 'em in the county, shaggin'
Long time ago, every magnet
Now they hold karats, yo old hater, old faggot
You been prolonging so long, gettin' money since '07
OT tribe that's gon' so make it
And my daughter look like Nicki
Wanna pop out, my pole ready
Can't let a fuck nigga sneak up on me
Yo hood is so basic, I just let a actress touch on me
Rich nigga, rich nigga, rich nigga, rich nigga, rich nigga

[Chorus]
Purple rain, purple rain, go away
Tired of pain and the struggle feeling, go away
Nowadays, I know some people tired of minimum wage
Nowadays, know some people try to copy the wave
Off these drugs, tryna kick my ways
Lemonade, some of these niggas is Minute Maid
Ain't have no game, remember them hoes used to play
Remember them hoes used to play
