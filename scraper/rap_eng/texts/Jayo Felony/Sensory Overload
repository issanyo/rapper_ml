[Verse 1: Jayo Felony]:
Hot damnit I'm jammed, savage
I don't wish death on nobody but
Everybody die and put X's on the truth
Man everybody lie
Ima keep it 100 hundred niggas in the casket
Earth on its way hell in a handbasket
But all this shit flowing how a nigga still in traffic
Big truck in my way can't get past it
Road rage at its finest it's your highness
Fucking allergies I need something for my sinus
Watching calories big bitch you gonna rewind this
Y'all could never see me niggas always on some blind shit
Sitting here on the run in this hot sun
Crooked ass cops make me wanna pop one
Got one didn't tell nobody did it on the under
Punk motherfucker never squabble never thunder
Frontline mainline crippin never PC
Always heat it up dont be slipping when you see me
Nigga think he fucking with the loco
Here BG bring your bitchass to the set and get a DP
Ain't nobody bigger than the sea but he can see me
I got squabbles on NHC
And it's petty where that came from
I love my lil homies fuck with me
They gon turn your ass and cheese into macaroni
He keep a Mac on and they call it macaroni toy
Take it back like the mole ass jacking these members only
They beat up some of the genuine they wanna wrap the pony
And if it was a tiger they'd call me lil pretty tony
Let's get this clear its only one shot kill
And if yall don't do it then one shot will
He can pop a pill pop a xanny bar ill
So sick and hold down my food I'm throwing up at will
I'm coming up again bitch don't roll up on my hill
And when you see my homegirls
Bitch they shoot to kill

[Hook: C. Ray]:
Sensory overload
I can hear everything everywhere I go
I can still see it all with both eyes closed
Already nobody in my space don't get too close
Don't get too loud
Ima have somebody have to sit you down
And ima watch em all bend till they broke all the pins and they throat on a binge overdose on some sensory overload

[Verse 2: Young Blaze]:
Nigga ima spit it so hard
Hop a rim with these haters
That be talking like they greater
But they knowin how I'm flowing killing yo squad
Campaign have em maintain blow em out the frame
Can't explain how I really bout the boat guard
If I load up a clip then that clip could explode
Leave you broke up and froze till I choke up these flows
And they showed up and fold and I rose up and told
Every hater I'm boutta pull both cards
Bunch of negative niggas with negative issues
Taking negative pictures trying to bring down
Ima overcome haters like a SRT Hellcat V8 with a mean sound
Hit the track real fast niggas knowing their crash couldn't cut it
200 on the speed dial
I hit the brakes on niggas should forgive throw the car up in reverse
Tell em niggas look at me now
I kill em all rhythm they fall takin em own keeping em gone
Niggas they know I keep they mind blown
The way I win lyrical ten doing em in making them dash on site
I keep on flipping like a timezone
I take no issue come get you the perfect missile will hit you no matter whoever shot your body come get you with my lyrics
They sizzle they burnin a hole through your temple official they spit you the mainframe hitting through your blood tissue
I shut it down Henny and everybody hating
I'm gonna give em what they deserve
No matter if you a friend or a foe or a foe of a friend ima kill it till it motherfucking hurt
Young Blaze in this bitch

[Hook: C. Ray]:
Sensory overload

Already nobody in my space don't get too close
Don't get too loud

And ima watch em all bend till they broke all the pins and they throat on a binge overdose on some sensory overload

[Verse 3: Ubiquitous]:
Extrasensory perception, I'm destined
Trajectory lets begin to best things
Left the dream requiem the movement
Of the people exodus now catch this
Rhyming with us the death wish
Deflected, lining them up to rect it, connected
Illusionist they use misdirection
Ubiquitous the bullshit detective
My selector, polygraph pen I'm a lie detector
Producin the fire apply the pressure
Paid assassin rye and the catcher
The way they rapping lying in a stretcher
And they been asking I been replying yes sir
I made a passion I'm taking action
I make shit happen while they distracted
Ill paint your casket, dig ya grave up
Read what he wrote then I rip the page up
State the facts and y'all ain't fit to fade us
They so excited never get to say much
The flows ignited, bitch I came up
Draining threes while yall Mr. Layup
Swerving hard you better switch your lane up
Fabricated call it Mr. Made up, go get ya cake up
Mad I made it on a path to greatness
Bring it back to basics
I been  up in the game now I'm acclimated
While they act afraid when plain fact is stated
Bitch that's the way it is

[Hook: C. Ray]:
Sensory overload
I can hear everything everywhere I go
I can still see it all with both eyes closed
Already nobody in my space don't get too close
Don't get too loud
Ima have somebody have to sit you down
And ima watch em all bend till they broke all the pins and they throat on a binge overdose on some sensory overload

[Verse 4: Godemis]:
While they all have sleep
Walk around counting sheep
Put your brain in a little bitty head case
Better not mind me on my grind ill be
You too busy catching Zs with your bedmate
Wanna die for a dollar go ahead slave
I know a lot of you do anything to get paid
Chopping up and catching flav with the switchblade
My Tecca Ninna buckle any nigga named mitch bade
Rappers ain't gotta know how to rap these days
Giving the gift you could think it's a nigga's bday
I got em running that shit is coming to replay
What the fuck ever pay em hand it to the DJ
This shit is wack enough to never get a replay
We say whatever the hell we feel like
Hit an idiot in the cranium with a steel pipe
You probably knowin the level a nigga will write
Step with aggression I bet a bully will get killed twice
Mean in the middle the middy murderin you little mice
My power peakin I'm seeking the will real might
You headed left and I'm stepping I better go right
So tight let the night show blind em
I'm murderin em and they don't know where to find em
The stakes high who better than I to climb em
If they forgot I guess I gotta remind em
The ice is too cold the shoulder's colder
The flow is nice so the sole controller
Been around for a while now getting older
And I'm spitting bolder till the shit is over like that

[Hook: C. Ray]:
Sensory overload
