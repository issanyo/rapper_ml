(Verse 1 - Evil Side G'z)
We jets E at G's
Bump that Evil Side with no others like these
So recognize the realist realist partner what you think
Life pass in front of your eyes like homies passing (__)
What do you think?
Its real over this way where we g's
OJ didn't do it Young Prod and Evil Skeem
Thing that the greens keeping a G like me know
Strapping ammo like rambo
Like some that 'posed to run are supposed to be a re raw
For the evil dream team seen on the screen mugging me
Keeping you're dough make forties with the beam and you seen
Fools get offended splendid
Busters get high be like a super sonic ended
Blowing hard as a cap lets pull the math
Lets do the dime mentality
Quick as a jet leaving you wet step into reality
Knocking on wood as hard as i could with this Nina Ross
Evil side Murder Squad killin' 'em off leavin' 'em tough

(Chorus - LV):
(Knock on wood) It's all about the G's living good
(Knock on wood) It's all about the G's in the hood
(Knock on wood) It's all about the G's living good
(Knock on wood) It's all about the G's in the hood

(Verse 2 - Sh'Killa & Gripsta):
Female G's that sit, they all say we nuts
The NAC pull, he sell it, then we bust
So duck. Run all you busters in my way
A female G and Gangstress the killer from the bay

Don't let my squad catch you slipping pimping
My homies don't play when we slay representing
With the heat
40 d when we creep
How you living getting paid let you ride
How you feeling cuz when the Nine goes pop
Bet a 100 does he pulls the trigger
Gripsta (sh'killa) I got your back (in the street)
And if you run up to us G's for sure we'll peel your cap back
We on a mission (187 with your mates)
Murder squad (that's just g) female g's ready to blast
Na can nobody fade us
Steady ballin' hustlers
Can't get this cuz we players
Ripping all that force, save that drama at ease
Knock on wood y'all cuz its all about us g's

(Chorus - LV):
(Knock on wood) It's all about the G's living good
(Knock on wood) It's all about the G's in the hood
(Knock on wood) It's all about the G's living good
(Knock on wood) It's all about the G's in the hood

(verse 3 - B.G. Knocc Out):
Now uh what would you do if I knocked on your front door
With a 44. you open it up then I let the trigger go
Blow! You're dead at the sound of a click playing the role of a trick
Got you dumped off in a six feet ditch
Kiss you bye bye brother why try to step to me see
You don't wanna see the d.r.e come out I'm with the B.G
Blue down and we drew down on you're crew
Ha ha I caught you stepping now what would you do

(Verse 4 - Dresta)
Now I BG and he be G and he wanna be just like me
Now does that make me OG and I guess that made G BG
But see G we all be out here scrapping packing macs when
Friends oughta be out here cracking helping to seconds black men
Been struggling for too long and isn't stopping
I know the hoods all good but still on wood I'm knocking
But damn I feel as though I'm 'bout to fall apart
See bangin's in my soul but survivals in my heart


(Chorus - L.V):
(Knock on wood) It's all about the G's living good
(Knock on wood) It's all about the G's in the hood
(Knock on wood) It's all about the G's living good
(Knock on wood) It's all about the G's in the hood

(Verse 4 - Havikk the Rhime Son):
I'm lyrically raw second it no prom i'm dumping on quits
I'll have them say raw so giving me deals on body bags (you Busters want some?)
My dogs will say my dilly is kind of scary when I'm feeling grabbing a Nine
From the spine I'm checking the chain (and popping a clip in)
I'm dumping on hoods and chumps
I'm out here with gauges and pumps
I'm leaving your mark black and heart
Cuz haven't got luck from the start
Deflating love with these slugs G
Just recognize these zello z's spinning like these doubling up like keys

(Verse 5 - Jayo Felony)
I'm crimin' and grimin' if i don't get mine I'm coming up in the click
Here's a stick what kind of stick loc a sherm stick
Let it burn quick pull it up pump to the rescue
Always running your trap with the strap I'm ready to test you
From the STC to the CPT my clique gon' get there bang on
I see your G rolling for these NAC we slang on
One time swoop they making it hot in the hood
But they didn't sweat the warrant so I knocked on wood

(Chorus - L.V):
(Knock on wood) It's all about the G's living good
(Knock on wood) It's all about the G's in the hood
(Knock on wood) It's all about the G's living good
(Knock on wood) It's all about the G's in the hood
