I say
I can give it to you but whatcha gon do wit it
I can give it to you but whatcha gon do
I can give it to you but whatcha gon do wit it
I can give it to you but wha-wha wha-wha whaaat

[Verse 1: Jayo Felony]
I can give it to ya but whatcha gonna do wit it
When I'm in Texas I'm bumpin' screw music
With Big Mike and Scarface, we loop-loop
Me and Lil' Crook like Bo and Luke Duke
When I'm in Miami, I go to scoop Luke
To see the peep show and hit some duke shoot
Went to Branson, back to back, Lex Coupe
Up in "Harlem World" in my Timb boots
Two suckers had beef so I watched them shoot
Called up Benny Rat, copped a bullet proof
Seen T-Funk he took us to the fruit
Then he went to the Tunnel and brought down the roof
Mink coats and moet, bitches drippin' sweat
Slang a cassette to Funkmaster Flex
And now I'm bumpin' on East Coast tapedecks
Went from Swatch to platinum Rolex
S.D., Jersey we getting more sex, flow next, go next

I'm too sexy for my motherfuckin' hood, hood
I'm too sexy for my motherfuckin' low ridahh (2x)

[Verse 2: Method Man]
Oh, my niggas can't eat? Then y'all niggas can't sleep
I just begun to creep, Nightmares on Elm Street
Release from Jones Beach to South Beach, capisce?
Kickin' dust as I bust, fuck peace
And all them crooked cops on the beat
My niggas bring the funk like your Grandpa feet
'Til death do us part, save my bullets for the charts
With darts, like HBO watching after dark
No love for a mark, even less for a trick
That wanna be like Mike, Mike who? My dick
Real shit Hot Nicks
Run wit my niggas that ain't got shit
Pop shit, and peddle poetry for profit
One time, out for mine, but can't stop it
Trying to keep they hands in my pocket
So I bring obnoxious, infected lah that be toxic
Leave the crime scene spotless
Mix the green with the chocolate, here's the topic
Niggas, synchronize your watches
We goin in, wit nothin' but a Clan logo
Mr. Meth, (DMX!) and Henny Loco, motherfuckers

[Verse 3: DMX]
I got a wicked flow and I'm gonna kick it yo, feel the pressure
Snatching niggas up just like change off the dresser
Niggas hit me with they best shit, then what
I shake that bullshit off *arf arf arf* then go nuts
Ive been down too long, can't a motherfucker show me nothing
Y'all bitch niggas is duckin' me like you owe me something
I got more homies than an esse, but lets say
I couldn't talk you wouldn't walk my way on your best day
The best way you can hope to get close to me
Is right here under my wing like you're supposed to be
The first time you start acting fuckin' strange
Best to be ducking range
Talkin' shit wearing a fuckin' chain
I break niggas like promises
Split em' open like Thomas's
And sell more drugs than a pharmacist
Strapped wit nothing but a rhyme a long history of violent crime
Attitude that doesn't mind doing time
