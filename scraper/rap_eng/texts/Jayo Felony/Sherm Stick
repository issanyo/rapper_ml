[Verse 1]
On fo' seven, the helicopter lights nearly blind me
In the south east streets is were you might find me
True bandana, my scanner, and my pager
In the blue 1994 one blazer
And I'm the one all the hoes wanna get wit
Jack Daniel punch and the indo spliff
You don't like the way I kick shit
You can get the dick, six fo' three wheelin
Mobbin' to the picnic
But somethin's missin', wake up and stop dreamin'
Tyshe let's take a ride to the coast to get a demon
Bring it back to Gomper's Park, we bought two
And everybody know what the fuck we gon' do

[Chorus]
We gon' smoke a dip, all of it
Not a little bit (we gon' smoke a sherm stick)
We gon' smoke a dip, all of it
Not a little bit, we gon' smoke a dip (sherm stick)

[Verse 2]
In the men's bathroom, fool let me have room
Make sure I light it right, so it won't go boom
I took four hard hits, and passed it to the next man
Now it seems like I got powers like the X-men
Sittin' on the curb, for four fuckin' hours dog
Thinkin' bout my homie in the pen, Lil' Boss Hog
Damn near dead, bout to head to the tilt
My homegirl woke me up, wit a carton of milk
I'm glad I didn't get caught slippin' when I was sleepin'
On them fools on the other side who call themselves creepin'
But see sucka, I'm from the Gangsta Nation crew
And everybody knows what the fuck we gon' do

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
Everybody that like to fuck, throw ya hands up
We gon' smoke a dip
Everybody that like to fuck, throw ya hands up
We gon' smoke a dip
(Sherm stick)

[Verse 3]
I flips the ill gangsta shit on the worst day
Bitches sayin', "Go Bullet Loc, it's ya birthday"
My homie B.K., threw a party and we got there late
You know I had to make them hoes wait
And when I arrived, the whole shit was in a trance
Niggas gettin' bong out, muthafucka a dance
Haha, gettin' ready for the next batch
My homie's asshole naked, doin' the muthafuckin' cabbage patch
Niggas throwin' up, it's a part of growin' up
My piss test is straight, it ain't shit showin' up
So duck, cause the next busta might be you
Now all y'all niggas know what my crew bout to do

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
Everybody that like to fuck, throw ya hands up
We gon' smoke a dip
Everybody that like to fuck, throw ya hands up
We gon' smoke a dip

[Outro]
Yeah, this for y'all niggas out there
And y'all bitches out there
Smokin' that water 
Rest in peace big Tray Dogg, much love loc
