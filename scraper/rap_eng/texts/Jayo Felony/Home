[Verse 1: JS]
Home is a place that I’ve never been before
Compared to Home this life is poor
When I get something I just want more and more
But at home I'll have everything and dream no more
Right before we see it He’ll come on a horse
God will be the light so we don’t need a sun
This shows that all we ever needed was the One
He sits by God and He is his Son
Jesus said “I am the beginning and the end”
Unbelievers will die and that’s the second death
So I pray so much that you will go with him
He is the father and we are his
God will be the last and the first
We shall be one with the church
And never more will we have to search
This is home

[Hook: Brian]
Take this world
I’m going Home
Take this world
Give me Jesus
To release us
From the hurt of this Earth

[Verse 2: Brian]
Murder, cheating, addiction
Is this the world that I live In?
So many lifeless souls
It’s like they're eating the world, it’s all fools gold though I know
What are people livin for?
Do we live and work then die?
Or is there something more?
Oh yes, I’m so torn
I can’t believe the cruel world
Cause all I see is scars, bottles, knives, rocks, and swords
Pondering all this, seeing the Creation, I found the Lord
And I experienced more than I’ve been told
But woah, there’s still a broken world out there
So I gotta go encourage uplift and share
I follow Jesus, and He loves them so I gotta care
And let me tell you this, I’m not wasting my voice
In Christ, I have joy, I will rejoice
For us who follow Jesus and have been forgiven, we strive to raise the banner
We strive for something greater
And I beg you, turn to Christ ‘cause that’s all that matters
And just listen and please have faith man
Cause one day we will see God’s face
Because there’s a God who your eyes can’t see
And our failing bodies and this broken world can’t take away our sweet victory

[Hook: Brian]
Take this world
I’m going Home
Take this world
Give me Jesus
To release us
From the hurt of this Earth


[Outro: Brian]
Heaven is the hope (2x)
