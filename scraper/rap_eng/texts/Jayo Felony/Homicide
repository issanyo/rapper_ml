Haha
Yeah
Take this shit back to the California streets
All y'all fools out there talkin about y'all gangbangin and shit
I hope you puttin in some work, fool
Check this out
We'll see who really down

[ VERSE 1: Jayo Felony ]
( ? ) I put in much work
I got my rep on the set for leavin buster niggas hurt
They shoulda never played it, now the hoes parade it
To see the Loc smokin sherm on stage with my shit braided
That's PCP if you can't comprehend
I'm puttin on my Karl Kani boots and I'm stompin men
Get em all muddy and bloody throw on the Chucks
What's happenin? Fools gettin bucked but I don't give a fuck
In Southeast it ain't no muthafuckin truce jumpin
Hot lead in your ass, my trey-deuce pumpin
I paid dues, nigga, don't act confused, nigga
Fuck around and make the 11 o'clock news, nigga
Cause I'ma carve my hood in your chest
In my piss is where all my enemies rest
That bitch straight snitched and then that hooker died
You'se a man or a mark, nigga? What's happenin on the homicide?

Wanna be
Is you is or is you ain't
Down
To put in work
On the other side

Nigga, we gotta get them fools on the other side

Head to the border like Lil Richie get out the set
I fold clowns and hold shit down like a hairnet
They couldn't fade it soon as I got initiated
Blue and gray Pendleton, house gettin raided
Rollin through my hood where it's all good
Breakin niggas in the gamblin shack, I think we all should
Pitch in, nigga, stop bitchin, let's get fucked up
If we need some mo' ends these busters will get stuck up
You bitches ain't seein this fool cause I'm a gee in this
Nigga, you see this muthafuckin cup? I gotta pee in this
Will it come dirty or clean? Bitch, try again
I drank a gang of water and took all my niacins
Four pills a day to keep the punk-ass P.O.'s away
Hey hey hey, what's happenin on the AK?
Rest in peace for the locs, for they side they died
I don't be foolin shit but is you down for this homicide?

Wanna be
Is you is or is you ain't
Down
To put in work
On the other side

Nigga, we gotta get them fools on the other side

In the pen I hit the ill beats on the table
Now I'm quick to start shit up like jumper cables
58715 was my number
Now I'm in your deck for the muthafuckin summer
So all you simps put a chain on your wife
I got gees in the feds and the state alike
Big Ron, Odie-Loc, P Roll ain't no fuckin joke
Fats just got out and now they got Balow
O.G. Thai Stick lettin niggas have it quick
Lil' Booya and Baby Booya take no shit
And these hoes on our dick like body lice, gee
Peace to my niggas Lil Tre Dog and Dicey
E-Dog still locked up for some bullshit
When Big Bull get out your throat's gettin slit
Cause all my niggas are down for the ride
I'm stayin true to this for life, what's happenin on the homicide?

Wanna be
Is you is or is you ain't
Down
To put in work
On the other side

Nigga, we gotta get them fools on the other side
