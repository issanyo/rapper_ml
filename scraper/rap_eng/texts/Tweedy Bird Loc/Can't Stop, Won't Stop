[Verse 1: Lil' Hawk]
Blood in, blood out
Steppin' up in my fresh red Chucks
All Crabs run up and all Crabs get rushed
Damn now I gots to watch my back again
Hooked up with the homies, Mr. Mack and the 10
Cause if it's on then it's on let the funk begin
I'm goin' out like a soldier C and the M
.45 on my lap 4 extra clips and
Lil' boy flue you don't wanna set trip
It ain't no stoppin' this shit

[Verse 5: Yank]
Click-click-bang was the sound of Glock 40, main
Five Lines four deep looking for some Rips to fade
Stabbin' down Imperial but ain't nothing poppin'
Buffle up on Brenshaw now we headed towards Bompton
At the 120th he had got stopped by the redlight
I grab the glizock I got the ?? and I grip that motherfucker tight
And I just might circle back around I finished
Pour one in your chest and watch your breath the man is quick
Fuck it, I'm messed up
And the Hunters is the blame, automatic is the weapon Gangsta Yank
