[Verse 1: LIL' STRETCH]
Livin' life in the fast lane, killin' up shit like the Lebanese
Out the ?paw? comes a child of the seventies
Rollin' through your hood, nigga lay it down
Commenced to leaving niggas whole hood a ghost town
But I told you once, and you chose to twist it
Four dead, three inch of that, a soldier did it
Comin' down with the niggas that hang with me
Never have to worry about them boys that sling with me
For the simple fact that them niggas bang with me
And some of you niggas say you're killas but just claim to be
And somehow, somewhere, yo I heard it's on
Rampage, grab the gauge, time to feel some peel some domes
G-Pops came through with the desert eagle
Fuckin' feed your fish nigga if you ain't our peoples
Only sucka ass niggas will keep running they mouth
[Big Wy] And I'ma knock your motherfuckin' ass out
And I sling these thangs, so fool, brace yourself
You wanna talk that talk, so let's walk that walk

[Verse 2: LIL' STRETCH & BIG WY]
[LS] From that first bullshit, I think your ass woulda learned
[Wy] Y.G. is what I be so it's stripes to be earned
[LS] They offered you councelin' to learn from your mistakes
[Wy] But instead I hit the drink and learn to retaliate
[LS] You pickin' up the tricks of the trade real good
[Wy] I keep the enemies droppin' to keep the hood poppin'
[LS] So you're a soldier, a young one to say the least
[Wy] Uniform fully creased, khakis too deep
[LS] Niggas comin' to your hood, bring the start static
[Wy] .44 desert eagle, full metal jacket
[LS] So you think you're tough just because you a lil' bigger?
[Wy] ? pull the trigger, ?fuck walkin' with the Wy is like??

[Verse 3: KEYSTONE]
In hatin' memory of the fool who tried to trip and got smoked
He's sent to fuck with Keystone, I put the gauge to his throat
Pulled the trigger, then I knew I had the feelin' for killin'
With no remorse I smoked the blunt and hit the drink, now I'm chillin'
Time to let him know that '90s was the age of the killas
Now when a nigga drank a 40, got a blessin' my nigga
You know we cold as killas, war in the city of tombstones
If you scared of dyin' don't enter the Watts zone
Cause there, you never go home the same, and it's my home, sweet home
Yo, my home is where my strap is
Home ain't where the heart is cause niggas in Watts ain't got one
The only thing pump blood around Watts is the shotgun
The pistol grip pump, known to y'all as the 410 Mossberg
So once again watch these niggas get served
And if they trippin' and you need a quick healin'
Then come to Watts and ask for young Keystone, age of the killa

[Verse 4: FO' CLIPS]
Now we gon' let the muthafuckin' gunshots come
1, 2, 3, 4 Clips on another mission
God damn, I got two Glocks and a MAC-10 ready
To put my fuckin' work in
My ends is short, and I need a fuckin' ??
I creeps on a store, punk ass Korean bitch
Jumped across the counter with the motherfuckin' quickness
Loaded a clip in the bitch just for screaming
Now my heart is pumpin', I think she hit the fuckin' alarm
But, but that ain't stoppin', because I'm from Compton
The bitch lie dead in a pool full of fuckin' blood
Still searchin' fo' some ends before I run
Gets the fuck out the fuckin' store with the quickness
Jumped into a tight 1977 Cutlass
Now you know how a young nigga walk nigga
Now talk that talk, and start walkin' that walk

[Verse 5: TWEEDY BIRD LOC]
Started at a young motherfuckin' age, a youngsta
Of the most hate niggas in the hood, I was among the worst
And the best talk is always cheap
Nigga die and come with it, cause I been playin' for keeps
It's on every nigga's mind, to try and take me out
Fucked up, that real shit is what I'm rappin' about
Shot a nigga in his face, at point blank range
A product of my environment, ain't shit finna change
Many nights, I thought about talkin' that talk
But all that shit came after I walked that walk
The worst you can do for me is kill your motherfucking self
And when you do that, Tweed will fuck your ??
Stank bitch, it's over, I told ya
No bullshit, get my ass paid '94
I'm puttin' on them shoes, they ain't payin' my dues
Step outside, you talk, you walk which ??, then you choose
Nigga...
