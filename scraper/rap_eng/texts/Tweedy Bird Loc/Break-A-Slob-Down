[Intro]
Nigga
You know I had to get ya! (x4)

[Verse 1: G-Bone]
Well it's the muthafuckin' C
Slob niggas comin' up short
Rip Ride, we slide to the muthafuckin' south flow
4 deep creepin', B.G.'s on a mission
Got word that the muthafuckin' slob niggas slippin'
We about to put the muthafucin' smash down
On these muthafuckas on the other side of town
Jumpin' up out of the muthafuckin' G-ride
Creepin' up out of the muthafuckin' Nutty from the blunt
There they go in a pack, slobs tryin' to bick back
We put them triggers on them slob niggas fuck that
This ass be sacked to the muthafuckin' G
Blaze up the blunt, took a shot of the Hennessy
We dippin' back to the muthafuckin' C-Side
Two C's, A.D., B.G. nigga Rip Ride
Baby Gangsta Bone is a loc'ed out young nigga
Straight slob killa, cuz I'm a Crip, fuck you niggas

[Chorus]
This is how we break a muthafucka down
Break a muthafucka down, Break a muthafucka down
Straight slob killa, cuz I'm a Crip, fuck you niggas

[Verse 2: AWOL]
Some niggas pulled up yellin' about that slob shit
I said like Spiggedy-One (Spice 1), Cuzz: 'what part of the game is this?'
Crip rich went to dumpin like he never bust no heat
The Gauge blew him back and knocked the slob off his feet
Came up down the alley when I clock my crip face hung
He said, "What's crackin' 'WOL?, I said, "run nigga run"
Cuz we just peeled the slob on the corner of my street
We made her park her shit, we blew that slob in her jeep
Then Hung said "Cuzz, I realize we got some muthafuckin' playa haters"
They hate me most cause they some fuckin' baby gangsta haters
I got cousins, I'm blowin' relatives in half
And we kill family Inglewood faggots wanna get my ass
But I'm protected by the blue and the green
Rat-tat-tat, put a Elm in the gangsta league, Cuzz
I guess that's how this shit's supposed to C
Cock my Glock, K's up to 2Pac, slob feel me

[Chorus]

[Verse 3: G-Bone]
I'm givin' up the C to these muthafuckin' snoops
Slobs catchin' the blues when a nigga dippin' through
Hand on my heat, pullin' the trigger with the quickness
Slobs feelin' the muthafuckin' wrath of my Cripness
Crippin' to the fullest cause nigga fuck slobs, fuck all slobs
Nigga I'm a muthafuckin' Crip, straight slob killa
Showing these muthafuckin' slobs no love
These muthafuckin' slobs are gonna be chokin on they own blood
Cause I'm fillin' 'em up with this muthafuckin' hot lead
Slob niggas are slob bitches and puttin' them muthafuckin' red smoked out
A loccin' nigga crippin' is all a nigga know
Dumpin' these muthafuckin' slobs with my chrome .44
My nigga, Face is killin' up shit, slob niggas feelin' the pain
Gangsta raw, makin' 'em stain, drivin' these slob niggas insane
Slobs can't hang
I thought you know the Bone is on my Crip job
South Side Atlantic Drive Crip Ride nigga fuck slob

[Chorus]

[Verse 4: AWOL]
Slobs better believe in heat on Compton corners with Glocks
Cause I'll C bustin' Elms a lot, yelling, "Cuz, this is Cedar Block!"
Confused, but they don't wanna K.C.B.'s, original K.P.'s, O.B.G.'s and B.G.'s
Too C's up, my bitch be laughin' at me cause I'm a nut
AWOL C givin' a fuck, you fuck with Kelly, you fuck up
Cause I'm not the nigga you thought I was, nigga from Kelly Park Compton, Cuz
Doin' the shit like Oklahoma, niggas was not knowin' what it was
Blood killa, steady packin' the heat
And Piru killa, leavin you slobs 6 feet deep, sleep
You besta catch A.I.D.S if you believe in magic
Or I'll seen pumpin' the trigger quick, leave the scenes tragic
Slobs better be thinkin' about it, better be thinkin' about they shit
Better be thinkin' about they hood, thinkin' about they slob bitch
If she flame to fuck up
I hope she's red enough
But if she's too fuckin' dry, I'm a have to help her out and wet her up

[Chorus]
