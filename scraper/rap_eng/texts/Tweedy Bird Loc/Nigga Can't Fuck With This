[Intro: B-Brazy]
Ladies and Gentlemen
Please give me a nice round of applause for ny nephew Li'l Hawk YG
Bring your ass out here Blood
Pull your pants up nigga

[Verse 1: Lil' Hawk]
Comin' right back at you, Blood it's me
It's that Crab killin' nigga from the C.M.G.B
D.L. when I bail up this biggety biggety block
With my hand on my Glock
Ready to pop and watch these fools drop
I'm Li'l Hawk
From the Crenshaw-motherfuckin'-Mafia
Swoopin' and woopin' candy apple Coupe and
Hair full of ?P.T.?, Black Pumas, red stripes
Black bhakis, red flag, takin' off on the mic
I'm not Snoop
But I'm quick to diggety dog your ass
With my strap, ready to blast, nigga fuck all Crabs
And um... I don't give a fuck you know
And 1-0-4 be the street where it's at for sure
So many niggas representin' the B and
When the funk gets jumpin' all the Crabs get to runnin'
But it ain't no hide when I'm C.K. Ridin'
Slippin' and Slidin' and we all West Side
To the tick and the tock and the tock to the tick
On the B you Crab niggas can't fuck with this (yeah!)

[Hook]
Hold up, stay off the nuts
Crenshaw Mafia niggas don't give a fuck
Ooooweee, who could it be?
It's that nigga Li'l Hawk Y-motherfuckin'-Geee

[Verse 2: Lil' Hawk]
Now come take a ride with a nigga like me
On the other side of town where the Bloods put it down
Steppin' right every night, Inglewood is where it's at
With my dog S.P., B-Braze and Li'l Yak
Mad Eye with the sack, cup of yack, that's my G
Homie from the hood and he rollin' with me
Till the wheels fall off YG Li'l Hawk
As I bails up the block with this limp in my walk
But since I talk that talk that be so way out
I'm about to blow a motherfuckin' Crab's brain out
Lay him out in the street, a dead Crab can't snitch
And that's what you get, you went out like a bitch
Should've been a B-Dog, it was all to the good (WOOP! WOOP!)
But now I got to kill you cause you from the wrong hood
This is Bloods bitch, you better recognise
You will get fucked up slippin' on the West Side (best side)
104 C.M.G. it don't quit
I'm Li'l Hawkster from the Mafia, you can't fuck with this (WOOP! WOOP!)

[Hook]
Hold up, stay off the nuts
Crenshaw Mafia niggas don't give a fuck
Ooooweee, who could it be?
It's that nigga Li'l Hawk Y-motherfuckin'-Geee

[Verse 3: Lil' Hawk]

You fucked around and got the wrong nigga
Come to take my motherfuckin' hood for a joke you'll get smoked out
?Pino? ass biatch ain't shit to let you know
And your shady-ass ?hole? motherfucker to the roaster
You know you can't fuck with this Bloodclot Boy

Ahhoowww Yaba-Daba-Doo

Trip, don't slip, don't enter the Mafias
The homies from the hood will break you off somethin' proper
I'mma roll with my niggas, I'mma ride with my niggas and
If I got to I'mma die with my niggas gettin'
High with my niggas, it's just another day
In the Crenshaw Mafia Gang C-motherfucking-K

And you motherfuckers know you can't fuck with this, biiatch!
