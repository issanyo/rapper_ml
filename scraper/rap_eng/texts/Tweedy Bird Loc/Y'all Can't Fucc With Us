[Verse 1: Fo' Clips]
It's that nigga Fo' Clips and I'm strapped with a Mac-10
Old B.G. from the C-O-M-P-T-O-N
Oh, it's a must that I talk on it
Cause we got wanna-be Gs, from the C-P-T
Like that bitch ass nigga Eazy-E
Come into my hood, wanna shoot a video
But what about yo' dead homies funeral
You ain't attend
So I recommend we dismiss yo' ass up out of Compton
I choose to deal in this city
And my homies got love cause I feel no pity
So don't claim no mo'
Fo' Clips will break you off with that Tre-A-Double O
I guess it's kind of easy claiming this city so far away
Can't come take a drink with the homies
As I bail through this city
With a rep like Frank Nitti
Not giving a fuck
Cause y'all niggas can't fuck with us

[Hook: Tweedy Bird Loc]
Can these niggas fuck with us?
"Hell naw, cause they too soft"
Why they want to be like us?
"I don't know and I don't give a fuck"

[Verse 2: RedRum 781 & Lil' Stretch]
Well it's about that time, to put ya' mic on the shelf
Eazy E AKA the hip hop Keebler Elf
You ain't a Compton Crip so how the fuck you gon' diss?
MC Ren swing and miss with that same old shit
Don't come around the hood if you ain't wanted
Don't try to flaunt it
You show off and get that ass broke off
Take a loft, we all know that you ain't hard
You can't stroll through the park without your body guard
"Lord have mercy. Are you gunna' hurt E?"
Before I pen that ass, and give him a permanent Murphy
Ain't worthy so back on up
And let Inglewood stack on up
To tell you the truth, I don't really think you understand
Becoming a show but then about to be mitted in quicksand
Damn, you get up quick and you straight up stuck
We living dangerous and you can't fuck with us

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Big Bun]
I'm coming out strong, hard like steel
Dissing motherfucka's with the basis I feel
Guilty, of the city you disowned
So bend over Ren cause it's time to bone, nigga
Now here's a Shock of the Hour
With ya' scary punk ass and them bean pots is sour
It's the same old shit, everyday and every night
And you getting fucked up so watch your back that's right
"So pass the clip" and watch me spray that ass
"Pass the clip" and watch me lay that ass
No hope, you fucking joke, you can't cope with a nigga that's real with words
So motha' fuck you Ren and fuck what you heard
Don't panic don't panic, keep Atlantic out your mouth
Jocking niggas over shoot the videos of South Side
Uzi's, the nine, the ass is mine
And Eazy-E, you don' fucked up too
Fucking over Pat, and Jemi foo'
Give up the money, the cash, and the bills
Before you wind up dead and nigga that's real
A-D, see what I mean?
Big Bun and Tweedy Loc, in your 'worsest' dream
Rolling, Controlling, tall like a tow-truck
Dealing out dope and I don't mean crack
Cause I get up at a high, and watching my back
It's a must, Dangerous Records mothafucka'
Y'all can't fuck with us!

[Hook]

[Verse 4: Tweedy Bird Loc]
Yeah Eazy E, not only do you want it
But a real G about to put yo' ass up on it
Bitch, coming with that whack bullshit
Thats why Priority dropped yo' ass like a brick
Trip, to shoot your video you 'criped' in the park
Better get yo' shit and escape, before it gets dark
'Youz' a mark, sawed off at the knees
Freeze, say please and I might let you leave
With the 3, that ass will be beat
Can't drive your "Benzo" without your little car seat
So speak, if you got something on your mind
Running out of time, walking on a chalk line
I'm about to turn Lorenzo into a Lauretta
Put ya' SuperSoaker up against my 9 Beretta
Double header hitin' two with one stone
Tweety Bird shot the Putty Cat now hes dead and gone

[Hook 2x]

[Outro: Tweedy Bird Loc]
Yeah MC Ren you punk ass mutherfucka'
Tweedy Bird Loc coming at yo' ass with a 9-4 nigga
You can claim to be a muslim all you like nigga
But you ain't gon' throw a rock in a racial fight, bitch
Can't bust a grape with razor blade shoes, punk
Yeah nigga, you'd rather jerk off with a grizzly bear than to fuck with me, bitch
