[Verse 1: Tweedy Bird Loc]
Tweedy Bird Loc is on a mission, that's to kill
Niggas on a dick get off your knees and write yo will
Make sure you leave everything to me, and I am taking it
Thought that you was the real I knew all along that you was faking it
Your path turned fatal when you got into my cage
Tweedy Bird what's waiting on my lap? That's the twelve gauge
Next time you'll think twice, I ain't nothing nice
When I'm paying dues, punk, you will be paying the price
Your fiddle is gonna cost yo ass, and rip on what I give ya
Not a damn thing to throw your ass in the river
Three motherfucking meditated, yeah I planned it
Found the house you lived in and the area outstanding
Mafia style, I caught you slipping
Told your ass to come with me, but then you started tripping
Pistol whip you in the head, beware cause my Glock is
Loaded, I control it, in a minute I'mma cock it
The bullet's in the chamber and this homie wants to meet ya
Sixteen shots down, what a way to greet ya
After all that, still complain I ain't heard of none
To me it's a misdemeanor, would've been to you murder one

[Hook: Geek Noise]
Murder one, on a sucker
Murder one on a punk motherfucker
Murder one, on a sucker
Murder one on a punk motherfucker
A punk motherfucker

[Verse 2: NiNi X]
Out goes the streetlight "Pow! Pow! Pow!"
Bring shots from my nine that I know has the Glock
A hood nor a mess can loose up my identity
A snitch and ass fool will soon be my enemy
And next on the list of a bitch getting fucked up
Talking all that bullshit, fool quick, punked up
Or get your head blown into pieces
This is just a warning and no motherfucker hard enough to seize this
I'm down with the Tweedy Bird, quick and plain
I place the gat over your head I put a shell in your fucking brain
So here we go and now you know ain't no denying
Stepping up to the Glock, you better stop or you'll be dying
My mission is a little bit different from all the pooperds
My goal is to exterminate the fucking Klu-Klux
Clan. Oh yeah I got a plan in effect
With knowledge, I got knowledge never fearing death
So now you know that NiNi X is real and on a level
What brings me much gore is killing blue eyed devils
Fuck the white man and his clan, and if I was dumb
I'd be in his courtroom. NiNi X charged with murder one

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Tweedy Bird Loc]
Murder, murder, murder, murder one with a gun
His last wish was a fucking glass of water so give him some
It won't do him no dam good for his soul
It's finna come right back out, but through the bullet hole
He tried to escape, when I caught him I said "I got you"
Point blank range aimed at his Adam's apple
I shoot in the back or the side of the hit
In front of his face, he'll see me then he'll be dead
Then again I might start from the bottom
Shoot my way up to the top, damn you got problems
I say sixteen of them, it depends
If your niece gets dirty and you say "Can we be friends?"
And all the words "suck a fat dick and beg for mercy
All I wanna hear punk is "Tweedy don't hurt me"
Then I think about it after that I'm gonna smoke you
I might have told you that I'll let you go, it was a joke you
Cause NiNi X don't fuck up, you'll get stuck up like a poster
Straight elimination by the Tweedy Bird Locster
Murder in the first degree, just fuck with me and you're done
Tweedy Bird caught his most wanted from murder one

[Hook]
