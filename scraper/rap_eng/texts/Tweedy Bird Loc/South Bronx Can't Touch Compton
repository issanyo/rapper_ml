Come on
Come on
C-c-come on

[Verse 1]
Fuck South Bronx here I go
It's finally the time I caught the nigga let him know
So I'm grabbing a Glock and I'm getting a bag of clips
Jumping into the Fleetwood, it's time to take a trip
Three thousands miles away, but first
I gotta get the niggas who put niggas in the hearse
Criminalistics ballistics I'm gonna kick this shit
And now you South Bronx faggots can suck my dick
So eat a dick up and quickly lick up
And ride the jock only on the tip 'cause Compton popped
So T to the I to the M, motherfucker
Stupid silly sucker, you nothing but a clucker
Sucking on dick like a pipe through the knife
Trying to recite what Compton writes
So when you try to diss, punk try to say something
Fuck South Bronx, nigga, this is Compton

[Chorus]
Fuck the South Bronx, nigga
This is Compton
Fuck the South Bronx, nigga
Well it's fuck 'em
Fuck the South Bronx, nigga
This is Compton
Fuck the South Bronx, nigga
Well it's fuck 'em

[Verse 2]
Tick Tick, bang bang it's nothing but a Compton thang
Fuck all you South Bronx niggas, you can't hang
With the rep of a nigga getting to the nitty gritty
Showing no mercy and saying "Fuck pity"
Because you silly sounding motherfuckers done ticked me off
And definitely gonna feel the wrath of my sawed off
Boom, boom, boom on hit and not one miss
Tim Dog you fucked up when you tried to diss
The Hub city, where true gangsters dwell
In the underworld, straight living hell
Now we're coming out the cage and rage making front page
With Tweedy Loc's song "What's Really Going On"
Plus this one will get your heart pumpin' and thumpin'
Fuck the South Bronx, nigga, this is Compton

[Chorus]
Fuck the South Bronx, nigga
This is Compton
Fuck the South Bronx, nigga
Fuck the South Bronx, nigga
This is Compton
Fuck the South Bronx, nigga
Fuck the South Bronx, nigga
This is Compton
Fuck the South Bronx, nigga [Come on!]
Fuck the South Bronx, nigga
This is Compton
Fuck the South Bronx, nigga

[Verse 3: Att WIll]
And when I prick ya like a stick real quick
Bang boom like a thrown brick
Had the Bronx fiending for this Compton dick
Instead of striking on city walls, I'm searching Tim Dog
Stroking his mine before he fucking with heart
That trickster never been in Compton and better not come
And KRS too you sucker, you ain't number one
Because we got the Tweedy Locster he's down with us
J-O-E- and A-Love they down with us
Hitman D and M-O-E, they down with us
Nini X and D Mark, they down with us
Ray Cannon, yeah, they down with us
Just letting you know you about to be some rust and dust
So hear me bust, just tell me you Bronx sucker's the deal
You wanna step in the ring, you better call out the real punk
Your through stepped on with the Nikes shoes, by a true nigga
From the west, Bang bang to your chest
But you ain't heard shit, cause I ain't said nothing
But fuck South Bronx
You motherfucker can't touch Compton

[Chorus]
Fuck the South Bronx, nigga
This is Compton
Fuck the South Bronx, nigga
Come on
Fuck the South Bronx, nigga
This is Compton
Fuck the South Bronx, nigga
Well it's fuck 'em

[Verse 5]
Fuck South Bronx, motherfucker, this is Compton
The Hardest city, where bitches get gunned down
Talking shit like a bitch from a distance
Can lead to a long term motherfucking ass-whooping
Y'all fools talk shit like your heaven sent
And ain't nothing, but some motherfucking hypocrites
Fuck with me and I'm gonna break it down like a stick
And drop ya ass like a motherfucking brick
See I'm the type nigga to take your ass for a ride
And leave you fucked up strangled off in Riverside
I might be crazy, but my name ain't smitty
You can fuck Eazy, but you can't fuck my city
Now what ya think of that South motherfucking Bronx
Hittman D is straight stuffing on chumps
And for the record I'ma still be stomping
Fuck South Bronx, this is Eastside Compton

[Chorus]
Fuck South Bronx, nigga
This is Compton
Fuck South Bronx nigga
Fuck South Bronx nigga
This is Compton
Fuck South Bronx nigga
Well let's fuck 'em

Fuck South Bronx nigga
This is Compton
Fuck South Bronx nigga
Come on
Fuck South Bronx nigga
This is Compton
Fuck South Bronx nigga
Well let's fuck 'em

[Verse 6: Tweedy Bird Loc]
It's Tweedy Loc coming from the motherfucking Compton clique
So ya South Bronx bitches listen to the hit
Say so long to D-Nice  and KRS-One
They motherfucking preachers, but I creep for my gun
Y'all start to whine like a goddamn sucker
Watch  Boogie Down Blood flow out the fucking gutter right where Tim Dog's at on a motherfucking stairway
Laying in a body bag for fucking with the dogcatcher
Bronx ain't shit and if they wanna come
Well I will reign supreme over nearly everyone
Step to me, nigga and you best to be bulletproof
Because Tim Dog you a bitch and so is ya whole crew
Tweedy Bird Loc gotta have it like that
So close your eyes when I pull your fucking skull back
I'm gonna fuck you up in your own backyard
It'll be a murder one when I rip out the fucking heart
I keep ya motherfuckers, because you met a lunatic
All ya fucked up punks are full of shit
So South Bronx motherfuckers need to learn something
'Cause ya bitch made ass niggas could never touch Compton

[Chorus]
Fuck South Bronx, nigga
This is Compton
Fuck South Bronx, nigga
C-c-come on
Fuck South Bronx, nigga
This is Compton
Fuck South Bronx, nigga
Well let's fuck 'em
Fuck South Bronx, nigga
This is Compton
Fuck South Bronx, nigga
C-c-come on
Fuck South Bronx, nigga
This is Compton
Fuck South Bronx, nigga
Well let's fuck 'em

[Outro: Att Will]
Because we got a Tweedy Bird Loc, he's down with us
J-O-E- and A-Love we got down with us
Hit-Hitman D is down with us
Nini X and D Mark they down with us
Ray Cannon is down with us
Because we got a Tweedy Bird Loc, he's down with us
Be, be, because, be, be
Because we got a Tweedy Bird Loc, he's down with us
