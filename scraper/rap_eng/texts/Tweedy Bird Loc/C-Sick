[Verse 1: REDRUM 781]
Crabs can't fade this because I made this to be stainless
The mind is a terrible thing to waste so I leave you brainless
The shit that I do makes me famous
Say my name before you die
And I'll make your death painless
My goal is your muthafuckin' throat
The adams apple would be slit by my cross bow
I throw low blows enough and I cuts like a Ginsu
You wanna hoo-ride, do you know what you're gettin' into?
I don't think so I grab your ho and hit the door
Nuthin' but Crabs stranded on Death Row
The L to the B blockin' out the third letter (Â¢)
Before I put a slug in the center of your sweater
Drop dogs like [?]
Ricket so runnin' up before I hold up my strap
And they froze
No one knows - of my homicidal capacity
I'm a pretty boy with the gangsta mentality
Hey, what can I say?
I let my Uzi do the talkin' and I spray
It's just another muthafuckin' C-K
Cowards Run In Pack so they take off
Their caskets will be close cause I blew his fuckin' face off

[Bridge]
"Yeah FRUIT TOWN PIRU nigga
They all gettin' C-sick
Them DENVER LANES and they all gettin' C-sick"

[Verse 2: RED RAG]
Well I guess I'm a gangsta
You probably know me by now
But the way that I look when I'm starin' Rickets down
I gotta stroll
I got some homies that's old, they OG's
My niggas packin' bank rolls
When I step up I make Rickets run and hide
Committin' suicide - justifiable homicide
Derange maniac mind of a lunatic
So damn nuts I go hunt with the toothpick
Cause I remember back to my early years
Step punk (pop pop) fuck the Crab and we outta there
We use to do that shit again again
Kick out the door, say hello to my little friend
Gimme the money, the Gat and we ready to go
We outta here, yo Dogg, grab the yayo
Nobody moves, nobody gets hurt
But nigga tried be hard, pull a Gat outta shirt
My nigga Dogg Poppin' one dead in they forehead
Stomp his ass as we watch his head bled
You see a man fucked up for all and y'all
Pump they ass like a muthafuckin' holocaust
As we gon' blow in their ass like whistles
Pumpin' they ass full of lead like pencils
We outta there after that the shit we did
My nigga Dog said don't fuck with the "kid", we on a rampage

[Bridge]
"Yeah My muthafuckin' Loco and Big Wak it's gettin' C-sick My homie Pops and my nigga gettin' C-sick"

[Verse 3: LIL' STRETCH]
I'm gettin' C-sick I roll through the neighborhood
A nigga with a problem
A nigga up to no good
Take niggas out with the fury of the trigga'
Have Crabs pourin' out beer for some more nigga
Give a half fuck about the nigga and his homie
So I creep, pop pop, with my brother Tony
Me take a nigga out motherfucker retaliate
Roll on the [?] then I hit the Main Street
Roll through the West Side to pick some real niggas up
The homie G-Ride, Spook Dog and my nigga Nutt
Five Line Snipe niggas ain't for that peace shit
You wanna peace something?
Piece your ass back together bitch
The AK-47 mixed with the maniac
Straight Crab crusher, kill a Ricket, niggas on that
So as I creep Crab niggas better drop quick
Cause I got the 9 and a Deuce and I'm C-sick

[Outro]
