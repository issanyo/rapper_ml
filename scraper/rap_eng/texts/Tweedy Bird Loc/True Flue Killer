Mafia Denver True Flue Killer...
(Gonna be a murder)

[SPIDER]
You Crab niggas step in tha hood and get burned
Punk motherfuckers that's a lesson to be learn (fool)
It's the land of fire flame, West Side Bottoms Gangs
Bitches on my ??? damn it's a shame
How they swing, how can I explain why the fuck they keep swingin'
Every time they bee them brazy gangstas from the C-M-G
B-L-O-O-D/C-K/R-I-D-/A apostrophie S on the West Side
Niggas know where the hood for life fuck who's wonder why
Slippin' and slidin' with my homies high as a kite
Riding through your set  late night smokin' endo
Lay back in a C Honda Accord lookin' real low
Tint on the window but a body on your block
So I got to shake the spot real quick chop-chop
Hotdamn I couldn't get 'em, was too fast
So I'm all in traffic off to kill another Crab

On the streets of L.A. the only Bloods on Figueroa
And Crabs still dyin' so fuck Crabs hoe

Beamed up like a bright red 1-0-9 watt bulb
