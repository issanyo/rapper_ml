[Intro]
Ay what up Loc? Hey where you from homeboy?
Kelly Park Compton Crip
Ay well nigga this blood nigga! (*Gunshots*)

[Verse 1: Red Rag]
How could a Crab go up against a Dog?
Dogs got paws and fag Crabs got claws
Pinchin' on B-Dog niggas like bitches
And I'm that Dog that buries Crabs in the ditches
Cover 'em up and flex back to my doghouse
The hard Rock Bottoms where the M gang hang out nigga
Nick nack paddy whack, give a Crab a bone
Don't give a shit 'bout a funeral home
Yeah I just love it when an E-Ricket falls
Fool, that's the life of a B-Dog

[Verse 2: Dogg]
Down a Crab like a bottle of C-B
Inglewood Gangstas, W-D-Z
Throwin' up the C, what the fuck you sign!?
Puffin' on a blunt goin' outta my mind
The O.G. Dogg is rollin' Rickets like a Cutlass
I'll put one in your ass
And leave your body buttless
Welcome to the C-K rag city
Showin' a Crab like AWOL no pity
No skilled bitch soundin' like Dr. Seuss
A-W-O-L: a wolf on the loose
Should've Beena B-Dog

[Verse 3: Lil' Leak AKA C-K]
Should've Beena B-Dog, punk this is Piru
Fucks Smelly Marks, Nappy Heads, Long Bitch and Tragniew
Here I go again about to straight dis
I got my plate all fixed for some Eggs Toast and Grits
Bitch-made nigga now you know who I am
Slammin' Rickets on their back but my name ain't Van Damme
I'm jinxin' muthafuckas like a gypsy
And if you want me
Fool, you're gonna have to come and get me
Hit me up and I'mma smoke you with my C-K gat
You Should've Beena B-Dog bitch and it's like that

[Verse 4: RedRum 781]
Niggas haulin' me off and it's a holocaust comin' down
Automatic gun sounds terrorize the whole town
Niggas don't suspect that I'mma hit 'em with some hot lead
Unloadin' my shit, makin' sure that they all dead
Wearin' my color, representin' the Blood gang
I can take a Crab and turn him into a blood stain
The voices in my head tryin their best to command me
They claim that I'm insane cause they don't understand me
Lil' Stretch comin' in with a roll call
Fuck all Crabs, y'all Should've Beena B-Dog

[Verse 5: Lil' Stretch]
Now I could start off fast, or I could start off slow
But the real gangstas know which way I should go
Well now the Hunters is deep, and ya know that's right
O.G.'s from the 4, the homie Tee and Half Pint
Small as a muthafucka, ain't takin' no shit
And the homie from the Ace my dog Big Rick
C-K Bone from the Duece, Chill Will from the Fo'
Lil' Stretch and P-Dogg from the FIVE ain't no joke
The Hunters in town and we bringin' the noise
Along with the Hacienda Village Boys
But now it's time for me to talk about the killas
Drink Old-8, but can't forget about the Millers
B-S-P, I-F-G and the Denver Lanes
H-2-O's, ScottsDale and the East Pain
Lueders Park, N-H-B is comin' right is at
Show you where it's at, N-H-P's and the Cabbage Patch
B-B-P, B-S-V, a Hundred-Tramp-Five
Can't forget about the Pirus on the West Side
M-S-B, Q-S-B and the V-N-G's
Fruit Town Brims, Lime Hoods and the Elm Street
C-P-P, H-P-G and the Athens Park
Bail through the Jungles, won't make it if it's after dark
V-T-P, Five Deuces and the Fruit Town
Walk through Harvard Park and you might get beat down
Weirdo Bloods, C-M-Gs and the Tree Top
East Side Pueblo niggas and the Cedar Block
Lil' Stretch Dog is finished with the roll call
And fuck all Crabs cause you Should've Beena B-Dog

[Outro]
Just don't let me see you shootin' them Dogs
Just don't let me see you shootin' them Dogs
Just don't let me see you shootin' them Dogs
Just don't let me-Just don't let me-Just don't let me see you shootin' them Dogs
Just don't let me see you shootin' them Dogs
Just don't let me see you shootin' them Dogs
Hahahaahahahah
