[Verse 1: Genuine Draft AKA Domino]
Long Beach Eastside in the house on the sub
From a nursery rhyme nigga cuz I'm a rub a dub dub
On the crip tip, keep it lowkey so anksta
See fuck this cuz I'm a preppy gangsta
Peace peace to my neighbor insane
Knock knock who is it, it's a crip thang
And I don't give a fuck if they think I'm set trippin
Cuz you know my moneys long and you know I'm 20 grippin'
Homies in the hood give me pen clout
And listen to me bustin rhymes, gettin' ginned out
A gang of niggas loc'ed out with the C-Rag
The homie rollin up the dub bag
I see you homie but you gotta stick your hips in
Cause you ain't getting shit if you ain't chipped in
Just kiddin' cause you know I'm giving love
To them muthafuckin' money makin' dubs

And leave they ass wreck three times for the set
