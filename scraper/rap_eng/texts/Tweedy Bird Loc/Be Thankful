[Chorus]
"Diamond in the back, sunroof top
Diggin' the scene with a gangsta lean
Oooooh" -William DeVaughn

[Verse 1: FO' CLIPS]
18 years old, fresh outta school
Not much to do, but run with my crew
Times gettin' hard, don't have no car
Pockets on low, wouldn't sell dope
Can I succeed, music indeed?
Puttin' hits down, waitin' on royalties
Can it get better? It feels like forever
Still thank the Lord, he opened these doors
Honey blunt burn slowly, homies hit they 40's
Street corner gettin' lonely
O-E to S-T how time passed me
Livin' life positively, too near me not to hear me
No gangsta white walls, but I still stand tall
Givin' my all to all of y'all
Thank God for what I have, even if I don't have
What?

[Chorus] x2
"Diamond in the back, sunroof top
Diggin' the scene with a gangsta lean
Oooooh" -William DeVaughn

[FO' CLIPS] For what you've got

[Verse 2: FO' CLIPS]
Isn't this a trip how life goes on, on and on
Without you knowin', that you gone
That's why we ever givin' parties
In my town, Compton majestics keep it stompin'
Hunnies smokin' ?? lookin' kinda cute to me
Step to me, cause I'm Fo' C-L-I-P
It feels good, done swung, hit a home run
Livin' in plus pad, smokin' a fat one
I thank Almighty for these ends
Put myself in the rag 4, put moms in a benz
I'm not sure exactly what you can do
But whatever you do, pursue and keep your peace and God with you
This goes out to the east side, west side
True ridas, new ridas
Get off your ass and pass y'all lighters
And help with what you do have, even if you don't have

[Chorus] x2
"Diamond in the back, sunroof top
Diggin' the scene with a gangsta lean
Oooooh" -William DeVaughn

[FO' CLIPS] For what you've got

[Verse 3: FO' CLIPS]
I'm lookin' at myself as a role model now
A young black male, came up from the Comp-town
Doing the best that I can to survive
I didn't have much but I still had my life
I had to make a choice to get up and get somethin'
Mad at the world, wasn't thankful for nothin'
Pops in my ear, but I'm hard, ain't hearin'
Ain't puttin' paper in my pockets so I wasn't listenin'
Don't get me wrong, I got love for moms and pops to the fullest
But I got dreams of makin' it in music
Pursued it, and now I'm so caught off them ghetto streets
Include that the ghetto still shall rest in me
The reason why, because I can't forget where I came
Compton, the city where we dip on gold thangs
I'm thinkin' back on the past
Damn, a BG didn't have, but I got up off my ass
Now I'm thankful for what I have
Cause I didn't have it...

[Chorus] repeat 'til fade
"Diamond in the back, sunroof top
Diggin' the scene with a gangsta lean
Oooooh" -William DeVaughn

[FO' CLIPS] For what you've got
