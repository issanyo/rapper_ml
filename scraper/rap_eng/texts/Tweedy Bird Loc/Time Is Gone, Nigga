[Verse 1: O.G.]
Bailin' up out the East Side, ready to go, hittin' the door
Niggas goin' down and dropped off with them triple gold
Thangs, but now a Slopes ain't givin' a fuck
About a copper tryin' to stop us, sayin' fuck them hoes, we stacking 'em up
And to the top is where we headed, yeah, we major player
Niggas up in my city cluckin' the most grip, we all into birds
And it's worth to the niggas in my - hood
That's movin' a motherfuckin' thangs doin' real - good
Know y'all, what's up boy, yo without love and tell it's hard
All my niggas is comin' up and gettin' large
Droppin' the top and never to drop a motherfuckin' dime
Homie you gets caught up in the game you gots to do your time
The consequence as a real bitch
But niggas should know what's worth than your word
So you best to clock your fuckin' grip
Niggas don't wreck yourself but get your fuckin' grind on
Go for the kill so you can chill 'fore your fuckin' time's gone, niggas

[Verse 2: Green Eyez]
Now I'm bailin' down the Four, nigga, bhakis creased
Then I laugh when I hear a Crab - hollerin' about peace
Nigga must be brazy, that shit ain't in my vocab
I put a cap in his ass and leave his ass in a rehab
Then head to the hospital, my job ain't done
I want to bee his ass bitch feet deep, and then some
Leavin' motherfuckers in a big hole
Went to scoop up Young Leak, Hops and my nigga Dogg
Pops lit up one of those fat-ass blunts
Now I'm high as fuck, nigga, on the Crab hunt
The first Crab I bee, my mind goes hostile
I load the gun and put one in his nostrils
For disrespecting
I'm knowin' for checkin' a Ricket
Tryin' to come to - low key and bickin'
With this motherfuckin' dog hollerin' "What's up Blood!?"
1-0-4 like I said, always draped in red
And if I hear you say "Crab" then nigga it's on
And your ass'll die - before your time is gone

[Verse 3: Big Wy & Lil' Stretch]
Now tell me who the fuck's next up on this mic?
See-K Big Wy finna punch out your fuckin' life
Here comes the smasher, straight Crab crusher
Killin' all Rickets, baby mamas and Crab lovers
Well boy, fuck all these niggas wearin' all that flue shit
I fuck up shit and I likes to kill fuckin' Rips
We roll on them niggas if them niggas hangin' out
Roll up to them niggas blow they motherfuckin' brains out
Buck his motherfuckin' brains, let these niggas story ain't bullshit
Empty yo clip and show these Crabs who they're fuckin' with
See-K Ridin', Damu Ridin'
Motherfuckin' Bounty Hunters Five Line pridin'
Now tell me motherfuckin' Crab nigga what's stoppin' ya?

Niggas better recognize some killers in your fuckin' face
Niggas gettin' slapped with the motherfuckin' Tec, bitch

It's in my mind all the time, nigga 1-0-9
C-K Ridin' is the motherfuckin' mission
Killin' all Crabs, makin' niggas come up missing
M and L, L and the M, all the shit is good
West Side is the hood, neighborhood, call it Inglewood
Nigga where I'm from? The motherfuckin' Projects
Where niggas get wrecked and they motherfuckin' chin checked
Bust 'em in his motherfuckin' face, let these niggas know
You from the Five and I'm from the 1-0-4
