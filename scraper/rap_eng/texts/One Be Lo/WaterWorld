[Intro - child]
Yo Lo, everytime I turn on the radio, the video
It's a booty, it's a necklace, it's, it's...

[Hook]
OneManArmy is who he is
WaterWorld is the name of the place he live
This hero came to set hip-hop free
From shady biz and all the wack MC's

[Verse 1]
Once upon a time lived a man named Lo
Everywhere he go he make the crowd say "Hoooohh"
Grown man flow for the boys and girls
Now let me tell you kids 'bout a place called WaterWorld
Shaped like a mitten, I rock the mic hittin
My block, recite copywritten rhymes I be spittin
Nobody knows the true identity
It's a Clark Kent thing, One Super-Man Army
Straight out the sound booth, Timberland boots
My necklace alone compares any wack crew
So now that you know who the good guy is
Every story got a villain, this one is shady biz
Kingpin, all about the dividends
Payin these wack MC's to talk to hip-hop citizens
With some powerful force they call rap
But the OneManArmy here to stop all that
Chop all that, maybe on the MPC
Literary, military on the M-I-C
OneMan, up against a whole Army
Full of A&R's, wack MC's and R&B
Industries, y'all nothin but snakes to me
Hip-hop, WaterWorld is the place to be
No place for shady biz and fake MC's
We 'bout to set y'all free, just wait and see

{​*Sample*}​

[Hook - 2x]

[Verse 2]
Aight, you know the characters plus you know the plot
Only it's a few people who can save hip-hop
Lo came fly with Timbs, pass the pens
Up, up and away, here we go again
Some think the Mission is Impossible
The truth is shady biz got a whole lotta dough
But OneManArmy got a verbal attack
And you never see me sign kryptonite contracts
OneManArmy is who he is
WaterWorld is the name of the place he live

[Hook - whispered]

[Outro]
Shady biz you better watch your back
Wack MC's you better watch your back -- watch out!
