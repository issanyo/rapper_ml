Beat Biters...
Dope Style Takers...
I tell you to ya face
“You ain't never touchin Labor”...
True Originator, Innovator, and Creator...
Thinkin’ independant but I’m sayin’ somethin’ Major...
The Government experiment with Beast in the Cages
If people don’t rise we at least see, the flame is...
Niggas like “Why do Police need to chase us”...
“Extra Extra”...
But don’t believe the papers...
Cuz pictures get taken and framed in Big cases...
My life is a gamble I dont need to go to Vegas...
Ya boy like Magic in this Michigan State...
I feel the draft out in L-A...
But far from a Laker...
You want us off welfare
We gotta have money...
My people want Health Care...
We gotta have something...
I love this HipHop shit
But far from a dummy...
You not baking that dough
Ya stomach get hungry...
