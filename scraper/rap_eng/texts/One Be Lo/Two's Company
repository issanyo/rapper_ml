It's such a beautiful creation, God's Art
And I ain't even started talking 'bout the body parts
Voltron when we' not apart
Lion heart
Warrior in the dark
And even the riots start

Not the average B's/beast
She aim for the higher marks
Trade knowledge wit me
College degree
Hella Smart

Thinking 'bout them times
We pulled debit cards
Jedi's
The red eye flights came from hella far

Just to get with the real deal
Won't stab you in the heart
Like Vivica, Kill Bill
But villain I will chill

Deeper than a cat fish school
No swimming drills
More revolution
Less televised
The real Gil/gill

Hi Jack a Jill hill
Figure like steel mill

Get behind the big wheel
How did the meal feel?

Blow in the wind mill
To send chills
Similar to notes I kill
Whatever pen spills

Being a Queen that's means having authority

From the majority
Similar her sorority

It's kinda hard to ignore
She' never boring me
Got me looking forward to foreign
And not important things

Vacations
Sand castles
Royal things
Real world love stories
Without the horror scenes

Support the King
And plus, she got her own dreams
Both working smart
Playin harder
Than a sports team
