BRIDGE
See I’m another specimen...
They don’t want to let me win...
But this one’s already won...
The top is not for everyone...

CHORUS
Honies on me...
Where I am is where the wanna Be...
Come Fly with me...
Maybe you can be my Queen...
I’m widely known...
I stay buzzin in the Streets...
I’m widely known...
I stay buzzin in the Streets...

VERSE 1
Yak Two- Forty Eight-
To the D three thirteen
I’m Malcom X-Rated
Ya’ll is P-G thirteen
My life behind these Bars, Where C-O’s turn keys
It’s madness, You don’t wanna See (Cee) Lo turn “Green”
I’m Incredible records show, ya verses was Wack kid...
Now here me commin “Atchu”...allergic reaction...
Until Infinity chill...
I came to build, wit fam...
Display the skills, get fans...
Pay da bills, get grands...
The way I feel
Can’t conceal
Similar to aiming steele
Tommy Hearns emcee’s...
You ain't a real Hitman
Blood money, No doubt...
The game is real shit fam
I “handle bars”, without...
The training wheels
Kickstand
Grown man
Walking these Streets
You need to hold hands wit ya bangin sister...
Pay me little to Babysit her...
I’m making hits that bang in systems, Mercedes Benzes...
Haters exist, I make a business to Eighty Six’em

VERSE 2
You take away the fashion statements
The cash and Famous...
All you got is One Be Lo, wit the classic Bangers...
Protein
One Bean
I leave you Salivating...
You rappers don’t want Beef...
Don’t even ask the Waitress...
Don’t even ask for a Collaboration...
That’s like Friday thirteenth, sending ya kids, to Camp wit Jason
I kill’em wit skill, the track left Assasinated...
Then pass it to a “Worthy” Jersey like a Magic Laker...
I got goals in this “Soldier-field”/ land of Pagans...
You’re like a linebacker -waitin’- trynna tackle Payton...
I rise above and Beyond, Earthly Imagination
Only let you down when the count, is on a Nasa spaceship
Sound like you countin’ on a platinum playlist...
You copy, scan and faxing pages, lack creative, flow exaggerated...
And now you talking on the mic, like the gat is dangerous...
But you ain't signing record deals, you signing affidavits...
That’s one-dimentional rap...
I keep the Baskin flavors...
I keep the saddles blazin’...
You keep the cameras tapin’...
You can’t escape from being Captivated...
Lyrical Hostage
You wanna stop this
Show some ransom Papers...

CHORUS
I know it stings...
I’m something you could never be
