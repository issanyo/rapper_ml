[Verse 1: Majestik Legend]
Man, everything's hot, or so you would think

I could've sworn De La Soul
Who feeling me out there?
All that platinum going to their head, like Sisqo
That ain't Hip-Hop no matter what awards you get, yo

Or getting chased by 4 cops

As MC's, we gotta stop writing that shit
And as consumers, we gotta stop buying that shit

[One.Be.Lo]
All them cats I went to school with
All them females I used to fool with
Way before the music
Some of us used to be enemies
Until they heard the CD
Now them cats be like "Yo, remember me?"
Oh yes, the One.Be.Lo vet, pose threat to your whole set
Branding bullet shells in your crow's nest
Even my old texts remain so fresh
Believe it's hot, the fever got you breaking in a cold sweat
I hate to say "I told you" so I told Jet
Lorena make you bob it/Bobbitt like a broke neck
Young and old heads, Adams Gomez, Jennifer Lopez
Him or her, both sex
No less than the whole globe gets microphone blessed
Suckers don't test, clone what I'm known best
Now that I'm on checks, groupies show breasts
Your dogs be on it like they want my bone fetched
That's the fever

[Verse: ]

You ain't critical, just mad you can't do this

Evolution of the game got kids with big heads that's short-sighted

I'm ill, jacking doctors for the cure

Type to fake a cardiac, next day you ask where the party at

Writing to more dead beats than illegitimate children
