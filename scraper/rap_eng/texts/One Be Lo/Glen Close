Ayo, when I shoot a rhyme I make you shudder
I shoulda shot a MC for tryin to steal my butter
He's bitter cause I'm better, so now he drinks the bottle
I did a dirty duty with a cutie she's a model
I met her at the party scoped her body, name was Patty
She's pregnant with a shorty, said that I'm the baby's daddy
Just paid for sweet potatoes nine months later had a daughter
Coulda said "I'll see ya later" but I stayed a child supporter
I didn't love the baby's mother
Now she's colder cause I told her
For the better that my other lady's name was Heather
She's like whatever, whatever, a tear she cried it but she dried it
Deeply hurted, broken hearted, but she tried to hide it
But finally she pleaded that she didn't want to end it or suspend it
She wanted me to sever ties with Heather
So we could be together
I said I'd think about it, but I know she don't believe it
She kissed me on my cheek and as she drove away she speeded
The next day, I'm greeted by her mother
Oh brother, she think I'm stupid
Tryin to play cupid undercover
Talkin about how me and Patty made the cutest couple
Then invited me for supper
Now don't think that I'm petty
But I know what desperate ladies put in their spaghetti
That's why I told her that I ate already
Oh snap, the hell?
Ay yo, ay yo, check this out
Yo, after we parted that's when trouble started
Patty was actin all retarded
I tried to disregard it but she keeps playin on my phone and blowin' up my pager
I wonder, how she keep gettin my number?
But I find out later Patty was a good friend of Brenda, the operator
I didn't sweat it
I coulda did something about it, but forgive and forget
The next day I got a letter
Yeah, you know who wrote it
I can't quote it in the same exact words she stated
But it was saying something about the times that we dated
The baby we created
She said she hated me for leaving
And soon she would get even
Sincerely, Patricia Stevens
After I read it, I knew where this was headed
And I couldn't let it go no further, not even a little
Right in the middle of this thought I was caught by surprise
It was a call from the hospital
Somebody named Dr. Evans
Telling me that my lovely Heather was in room 311
So pedal to the metal I got there in seven seconds
She's alive on my arrival, even though the signs are vital
I asked the doc what happened
A hit and run accident and not a single witness police never caught the driver
Deep inside I knew that Patty did this
Yo, so if you find true love, hold on til the end
Cuz we all know the women outnumber the men
I caught one to play me close like her name was Glenn
And I'll be damned if I ever let it happen again
Fatal Attraction [repeated over scratches]
Yea, yea, I caught one to play me close like her name was Glenn
