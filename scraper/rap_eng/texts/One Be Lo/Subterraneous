SUBTERRANEOUS!
From WaterWorld, bubble, lakes and floods
Planet of the Apes in Tux-
Guns in Baby Clutch

It's like a Jungle Dangerous
Sometimes
It makes me wonder How I keep from going
Under Navy Subs

Subterraneous!

Tongue available in other languages
Custom slang wit it
Or visit a couple ancient ones

Like Corpus Habeas
Tell 'em "Open the cages up"

Stuck a chain on us
And tainted mud with native blood

Pyramid angles, plus Angels, plus Angel dust
Complex, above the Aliens
Humble the Atheist

Uncle Sam troubles make a fuss
Scud and Patriot

Pilgrim to Peninsula Arabia
And Prey on us

I slam wins with the Pin Hulkemania
Off the top buckle cater kicks, knuckle sandwiches

One Man Army

General Subliminal

Lofat, Nahshid, Lo Be One hundred Alias

Subterraneous
