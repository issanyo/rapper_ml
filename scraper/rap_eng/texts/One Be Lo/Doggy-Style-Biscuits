VERSE 1
Whether you’re amateur, immature, either or...
They took the tether off his leg, he step in the door, record store...
She say she met him for, metaphor...
After the show, second floor
She want a bone...
A dinosaur
You think I’m lyin’(Lion) I can let it roar...
So why you think she at the dresser drawer?
What she gettin naked for?
He pulled his weapon on it...
She surrendered with no protection on her
“body is a temple” he said “Thank the Lord”
Call it religious or sec-u-lore...
They’re blessed-be-yond, the reg-u-lore
Sweeter than honey moons
Let’em resort...
Rest a shore (assure)...
Like love birds of a feather, together flockin’ forever more...
Exaggeration-
Read between, the rapper lines
Battered her eyes, now it’s “Hammer time”- to strategize...
Rick James was the record on...
He the King, she the Queen...
With or without a checker board

VERSE 2
It’s a thin line...
Between love and strong feelings...
And that can include love
Could be over ya head
You still fall thru the ceiling
A puppet on a string
A lean dream, steaming a string bean, in jeans
I float like a butterfly wing
Bumble like a bee
Rumble like a ding ding
Jungle in the ring
Double on the sting
Butterfly knife, couple swings
Cut like a Upper swing...
Make ya’ stomach sing, like a big-boned lady
Voice shatterin’
Glass droppin’
Black coat
White phantom
Black opera
Second act harder
Coming like sap lava
Cussin’ like a cab driver
Can’t Dodge a Ram Charger
Same thing like sewer and tap water
I rather dig a well where the bucket splash harder
Try to minus or divide it you got a math problem
Some dummies still trynna to add it up in their noggin
