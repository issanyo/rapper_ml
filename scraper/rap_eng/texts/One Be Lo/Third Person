[Hook]
This can’t be life in the whole
And we don’t know which way to go
Your destiny is a craft of gold
A holy treasure to behold

[Verse 1: One Be Lo]
Compose art, like Mozart take the stage
Favorite symphony, Craig G, Rap, Ace, and Kane
I’m comin' at 'em, Eve, and Abel Cain
But won’t hesitate to wave a blade, miss me la, slay the game
For survival, keep you on your tippy toes
Even with an ankle sprain, (ouch!)
Sometimes there’s no gain without a major pain
Play my roll Damon Wayans
A native dance in the soul train’ll make it rain
All exposed in a naked way
We see the scars, tattoos, the varicose veins
If I see a barricade I’ma make a way
My syntax wall of fame like graffiti on trains
Spray ‘em like a drive by for the ones laying in a grave
Memories that never fade away
Peace! The block letters, shaded shapes
And a painted face
Cause one picture is worth 1,000 words peep the rate exchange

[Hook]

[Verse 2: One Be Lo]
Pontiac Trans Am transform on the autobahn
Mega Deceptibots, beats by the Autocons
One Be Lo flow sound warm through the Avalon
Power over Megatron, tower over Babylon
My iTunes like bright moons and high noons
Left-handed writing these haikus
Thats a tight screw if you turn
The page keeping your eyes glued
Looking for the signs and clues your bound to find jewels

Buried alive like girls in Jahalia
This is not mcing, its the voice inside human beings
Its the thread between needle semen
The whole point I’m trying to make:
Music embrace a lot of people
Penetratin’ that mental state with stimulation
Insemination from generation to generation
Real life situations on paper
For everybody to understand
S.O.N.O.G.R.A.M. labor patients

“He's wrong, it don't take much strength to pull a trigger, but try and get up
Every morning day after day and work for a living. Let's see him try that. Then
We'll see who's the real tough guy. The working man’s the tough guy, you're
Father’s a tough guy.”

[Hook]
