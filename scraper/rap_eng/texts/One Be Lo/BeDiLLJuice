I don't join 'em, I beat'em
Defeat 'em like feet on dung scrubs
The Beatles comparing my drums, be starring Ringo

B' roll like the movies
B' code these one, zeroes

To be fair
Some rappers be high
Could never be Lo

The beats entree
Like beef be on plates
Every one in three thousand wanna be Andre

Be wishin'
They could bewitching with Dr Bombay
Beyond words
Beyond J
Ladies Beyonc√©

Begone way rappin
Ambassador flood flashin'
The camera
With ya amateur manager in the passenger
Even if you traveled to Vatican
Tried cross me with Catholics
Ain't shit happen
Like abdomens with a catheter

Haters why bother
They want me to bring it harder
I'm pulling a Slang Blade
From the sword
King author
Bars stab hard to the core
Deep chakra
Websites post it on the wall
Pete Parker

Boom shaka lacka
Number one Chief Rocka
Til my sons bye Fords like Run D's father
Al Ben/ been a Pay Pal
Daryl Mac model
Mean I crown McDaniels
And clown McDonalds

'Justin' case
You you wanna run it down a bit
That's my

Spontaneous
Peeps
On
Other
Kinda
Shit!

A Spook on the gas
Unregular leaded squeeze
What else?

Speed of sound
Stealth, jetting through the breeze

Who else?

One be Lo
Beheaded with guillotines

Nobody next/necks
I promise you'll negative feel a thing
