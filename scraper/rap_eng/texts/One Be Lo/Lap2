When the S-u-b is on the set
I guarantee it's a sight you will never forget...

[Scratch Hook from 'Indy 500' by Binary Star]
"It's the battle of David and Goliath, the big and small"
"My goals to win the Indy 500"
"We need to take control of this shit and get it all"
"My goal's to win"

[Verse One: One Be Lo]
Ayo, this is the part where Lo's verse come in
Heard some kids was fans, don't curse for them
They can say "One Man Army work for his."
While them other MC's gettin' jerked again
Contract with the devil now you work for him
Keep it real so you talk about the dirt you did
But the truth is real, it hurts again
Beat you down, you walk around with purple skin
I didn't follow those signs so I turned to sin
Heard cage bird singing on my first offense
So this one is for the homies in the circus tent
I ain't never seen a drop top hearse with rims
On the last day player, don't be nervous then
Truth in the falsehoods like shirts vs skins
Tackle real issues till I'm first in ten
Touchdown in the artificial turf you live
When I think about the fire, plus the earth and wind
All praise to Allah while they worship men
In this Waterworld, cats wanna learn to swim
But I know about the ark like I heard the twins, yo
