[Invincible]
Yo I'm mad foul, never missin' my free throws
Bet on my casino, you lookin' for knee blows
Dissin' them fee foes for bringin' them weak flows
The rest fail I excel/XL like Chino
Paid dues and they snooze for free shows
Now I need no introduction to breath flows
And I see doe/dough
Watch it rise to a loaf of bread
All you got is loose change in the sofa bed
We comin' at chu
And cause we ill we gon' blow till your nose is red
Yo I'm just statin' the facts
You're speakin' secret codes and you're playin' 'em back
To find out what you sayin' is wack
The brother Decompoze he be layin' the track
To wake your ass up if you takin' a nap
And how we did that is by makin' 'em clap
M.I. land on lakes, put my state on the map

[Verse Two: Majestic Legend]
It's Legendary
The name is a goal in itself
Must be a hole in Hell, cats is walkin' lower than elves
I didn't come for you to give me respect
I came to take your fan base home when you feature me on your track
Compoze D know the procedure
We don't need ya
You blow reefer, got no breather, you won't keep up
My blast on yo last longer than slave tans
Finishing off your prayer wouldn't make you Amen/A man
The underwater connoisseur, encore bravo receiver
I tai kwan do the tweeter till my feet leap out the speaker
And reach ya, with a boomerang effect
Hands fall quick like sweatin' with toilet paper necks
Starvin' artists always stay hungry
I'mma play the kindergarten bully
Say somethin' I'll take ya plate from ya
Leave you with a day of thunder
A night of lightening
Legend ?? with dimes in size ten

[One.Be.Lo]
Show me the page, I'll show you how the quotables come
In a game where the competition total is none
Holdin' your gun, slowin' my funds
You couldn't stop Lo from mic with opposable thumbs
Hitchhike and ride the drums, till miles on in
Convertible kilometers, speakers volume ten
I master track level, treble and bass, ahead of the race
You can meet defeat/de feet on the gas petal
Jump in the ride, Indi 5, couple of O
Unleaded with the freestyle, pump it and go
I black out like I'm in the movies Hustle & Flow
You back out like the old people shovelin' snow
In the winter time
One.Be.Lo in his prime
See rhymes and behind bars before it's time
The reason CD's repeat, tapes rewind
MC's knows my lines like coke heads deny

[Elzhi]
I got 'em sayin' "Oh no, it can't be Elzhi again."
They too washed up like Dion's psychic friends
Level sky high they lookin' through a sniper's lens
Way over your head like the rains highest winds
Niggas wanna know what I'm about
I find where they stay
Then catapult them out they house and watch 'em lie on they gate
With every purchase made, they'll tell you I'm bringin' heat
But won't say my record, when they verse is played
Folks lookin' out of curtain shades to curse my name
Cause the surface change when I burst grenades
I think heavy on cassette, it might leave your brain fractured
So now your heads bruised and now you think it rains backwards
Them niggas ain't stupid, they know that I'm a threat
They ain't smart, they ain't got heart I throw it out they chest
Then we beat it like it's full functional
We bullies up on your block
Drunk on your spot, you nothin' but twat
