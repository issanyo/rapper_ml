Bein an MC sometimes in the world of rhyme
Through my neighborhood or whatever trying to get some inspiration
I'm tryin' to absorb the environment
One time I was thinkin about the neighborhood so much
It was like I was the neighborhood

[Verse 1]
Yo, I once had a vision all listen-
Cause they thought brilliant smart village filled with tall buildings-
That a cost of livin' cost millions televisions now the smart children-
Fall victim to the law officials tainted by my false system(?)-
Had all wisdom just before I started dennis (who?) the menace-
To society inside me suicidally blinded me no sobriety for notoriety-
My world is chaos now brainwash rest the mentality
