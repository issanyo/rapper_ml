[Intro/Track Sample from Irvie Marshall]
Yeah yeah, welcome to my world

[One Be Lo Intro]
Apocalypse Lo
Apocalypto
Apocalypto Lo
Lo-pocalypse

[Verse I: One Be Lo]
Let me take you to a world I represent
Pilgrims ain't even settled yet
One hundred and ten percent indigenous
Sunny days heaven sent
Even on rainy days, umbrellas say I’m never wet
Team never dry beans, the greens stay ever fresh
Next obvious rhyme, I never get, effortless
In ya chest, leaving you breath-less
Arrest development
You never met a nigga yet? say what?
I rather be a nicorette
Only thing I quitted was smoking on a cigarette
And I didn’t regret
Paying dues
I see you looking sharp, like a knife in a fight
I’m going Kat Kat Kat
Open fire, onamonapia(onomatopoeia) auto mat-ta-tat
Bust, Ivory tusk
Elephants, never forget
Think you can play in my shoes?
Okay, ready-set-go
I don’t need a gold medal on my chest
To rank best
You second guess
Follow in my steps
This life, a mountain Everest
Blood, sweat, hella stress
But, only a test, if only we prepped
I guess

[Interlude]
I guess
World
I stress, hahaha
Yeah

[Verse II: One Be Lo]
I see these bars like a convict, It’s time to behold
I do a track/attract like magnets
With opposite poles
Apocalypto
I like to rip shows
She park her lips low
I hope she think she not a bimbo
I’m launching missles
I’m stomping where ever I go
Flip flop or Timbo’s
You thieves gotta whisper that flow
You gotta tiptoe
Remember when the spider bit Lo?
Now peep the Venom
Peter Parker learned not/knot
How to tie you with rope
My home page web site I drop a line on your folks
You wanna fly high?
I make 'em say good bye to that roach
You die in this life, survive as a ghost
My instinct, eye of the tigers
It’s close to extinction, like it I don’t
I’m fighting for life on the rope
Like the greatest of all time is the goat
Horny High off this dope
It’s time to float, like a butterfly and I don’t
I’m more like a caterpillar, crawling on the side of the road
Go

[Long Outro Sample from Irvie Marshall]
Oh whoa whoa, welcome to my world
Singin' welcome to my world
