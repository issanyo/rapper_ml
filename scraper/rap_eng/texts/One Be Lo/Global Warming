From birth crying, circumcising
My work applying, time burglarizing
Persons retire to Dirt Alliance
It's Perfect Science like burger fries and Colonel Thighs
Mines Turpentine, these twerps tiny
These serpents giant
They' making hits but I'm the murder writer
Shitty rappers look like the shit
It make us look like the fertilizer
My brother J Pioneer Grand Verbalizer
X resting in peace
Peace To Prince the Purple Biker
No Justice
No Peace
You heard the riots
All Around the World, many shocked G
Words applying
'Same song' translated like the Word of Zion
Swearing like a nervous liar
Hand on attorney bible
I lend myself to these lines, I'm certainly bias
Black boys playing with playin' plastic guns, burnt with the iron
Triangle patterns over my head, vultures and lions
Eyes want a piece of ya pie
Ain't no curbin' this diet
I'm in my own lane
Sometimes swerving but still driving
With a permanent license
Through this furnace assignment
Earning my stripes in this world war, further surviving
Stars in my camp, concentrate like German Defiance
The evolution of mind
Gears working behind it
Often conversing in private
Treasure be lurking inside it
Only the searchers can find it
Deep with a burning desire
See culture returning to violence
When the workers get fired
