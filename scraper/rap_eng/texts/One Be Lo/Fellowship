[Intro]
Serious
Yo we gonna do it like this, Binary Star
The notorious Athletic Mic League
And my man Decompoze, got flows
Freakin' em just like this, yo

[Hook]
Yes yes ya'll, (yes ya'll)
AML got the vibe ya'll, (vibe ya'll)
Real live ya'll, (live ya'll)
Yes yes ya'll, (yes ya'll)
Decompoze got the vibe ya'll, (vibe ya'll)
Real live ya'll, (live ya'll)

Yes yes ya'll (yes ya'll)
We got the vibe
Real live ya'll. (live ya'll)
Real live ya'll. (live ya'll)

[Verse 1: Buff1]
In this age of the Sagittarius
I'm abrasive in various ways, if you come across makeshift
Cause fake is as fake does
And fake kids get fake love and lace you with hate, that weighs tons
So I try to stay away from those type of guys
Don't got the heart to show love, no vital signs
We lost 'em, horizontal line, no pulse rate
For usin' all your force to hate instead of tryin' to coordinate
Y'all trashin' the name
And that's all we have in this game
No where near the cash and the fame
So if you wanna bring it back to elementary school
Na na na boo boo we hate you too

[Verse 2: Decompoze]
Decompoze, rhymes come together like crochet
Shake it with me no way
I rose like a bouquet
It's ok to imaginate
But when the rap is great
It's a bad mistake to gladiate my magistrate
You'll have to wait cause I can't stand you
My command tool make your ear ring like bamboo
I plan to reach higher peeps
Rhymin' liver beats
Hit entire streets, inspire peeps
You better Bounce like dryer sheets
So what's the matter son cat got ya tongue from the raps that I swung
Strap got you hung from the crap that you spun
Attack with a gun that's where I'm darin' hoods can't see us like cell
As I'm reachin' heights that fahren could
Get hot, and rise to the top like mercury my birth'll be workin' these mics' circuitry perfectly
Worship me, I got what you lust for
Cause on a rough tour I rock heads like Mt. Rushmore

[Hook]

[Verse 3: One Be Lo]
If you're hungry for some real hip hop, we came to feed you
I lead you, outta the dark with my cerebral
Shine on the mic, don't you party people front
We wanna see you jump like Evil Kineivel stunts
Binary Star Athletic Mic League assemblin'
Fire kindlin', God's gift to adrenaline
Representin' Waterworld that's Michigan
You lack discipline
You going nowhere like flat Michelins
Take off your Timberlands, you won't need 'em
That's what I tell emcees before I battle and defeat 'em
The anonymous
Who the heck am I
Testify
Guy on the mic you can't see with the naked eye
Givin' you individuals invisible rituals
Line after line habitual, not your typical rhyme
I said it first, whatever works, energetic verse
Your head'll burst, I bet it hurts
Time for red alerts

It's like this
(They ain't got the brains, the heart, to spark with my fellowship)
Whack MCs be the first to diss
(They ain't got the brains, the heart, to spark with my fellowship)
I hear a million MCs pop they lips
(They ain't got the brains, the heart, to spark with my fellowship)
It don't matter how many mics you flip
(They ain't got the brains, the heart, to spark with my fellowship)

[Verse 4: Vital]
Metallic
Jurassic soul survival
Restricted binder
Oxygen to brain depriver
It's time ta
Hide me in your basement
I introduce myself as Radon
Spray cans, I'm more bomb
Then Air Force One let me be a skydiver
Divider
Swing my dreads break the blade of Delilah
Besides the
Fact that we the cats that lick the grit from Ell's diner
My neck concentrates a quick twitch muscle fiber
Masters of deception
We do a show
Show a little affection
If the cat in the front row fronts
The monitor speech will detect 'em
You're best off to move ya rectum
Side to side just like a spectrum

[Verse 5: Senim Silla]
Jacques Cousteau
Amphibian skills
So deep, you need gills or training from NAVY seals
These waters are treachereous
And for rappers jeapordous
Lames who test this are like Charles with a death wish
It's suicidal
Bring a knife to a gun fight
You dead on arrival
You should've known better
No court'll hold me liable
It's the law of survival
Chapter one verse one of the emcee bible
Need ta get up on ya studies
School's in session for you and your butt buddies
Take it back to rhyme structure 101 for you dummies
And class is free
So you can keep your pot moneys
We do it cuz we're hungry
We're predators that hunt for the kill
Bust for the rush
Thrill seekers on a natural high
We shootin up
Through your veins uncut
Hotshots and such
Fiends by any means
You'll feel it when we touch
Many cats try to rap with this
(They ain't got the brains, the heart, to spark with my fellowship)
Whack MCs be the first to diss
(They ain't got the brains, the heart, to spark with my fellowship)
It don't matter how matter how many rhymes you spit
(They ain't got the brains, the heart, to spark with my fellowship)
Theres a million MCs that pop lip
(They ain't got the brains, the heart, to spark with my fellowship)

[Hook]

Yes yes ya'll (yes ya'll)
We got the vibe (x8)
