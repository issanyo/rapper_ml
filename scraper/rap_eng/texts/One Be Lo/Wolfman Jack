[Intro]
{*wolf howls*}
To lovers, the moon is a thing of beauty
But, to this man it is a deadly curse
When the moon is full, this miserable wretch turns
Into a hairy, snarling, half-man half-beast!

[One.Be.Lo] + (Senim Silla)
ONCE UPON (a midnight dreary) I see the full moon clearly
The wind sounds eerie (don't it chill your spine?)
And don't these shadows make you leery? (Cause with dark there's dirt)
The place of birth of the evil man's work
(Who's the man?) Some cat named Jack, last name unknown
Anti-socialist, barely left his home
He don't say much (wig full-blown) he don't shave much
Nights like tonight he would rather stay up
Instead of going to sleep (he's in the dark of the streets)
(He has a hunger, cravin but his taste unique)
(He has a hunger, cravin but his taste unique)
He has a hunger, cravin but his taste unique
Most people in the neighborhood afraid to speak
(They call Jack a savage man) Jack was not your average man
(Although he got arm, leg, a leg, a arm, head, feet and hands)
He was far from me and you (my man you wouldn't understand)
He travels through the shadows survivin off instincts
There's a young girl found dead behind the skatin rink
(Not far from Ned the whino's sittin in his own stink)
HE SAW THE WHOLE THING (told 'em Jack was the link)
(But nobody takes him serious) Why? (Because Ned drinks)
Why? (He slurs when he talks) Why? (He staggers when he walks)
Well whoever he is, whatever he is HE'S STILL ON THE PROWL
FULL MOONS MAKE A MAN WILD

[Interlude]
He prowls the night
His fangs, thirsty for, human blood
He, is a werewolf...

[One.Be.Lo] + (Senim Silla)
ANOTHER VICTIM, cops blamin Rottweilers and Pits
(But drunken Ned spreadin rumors 'bout some werewolf shit)
Man, ain't nobody got no time for fairytales
We livin in a world full of crimes, murders and crack sales
(So our eyes are desensitized, nuttin surprisin)
We numb to the fact the murder rate keeps risin
(That night) Some kids that we knew from school
(Wanna make Ned look like a drunk old fool)
So the plannin, THEY WOULD SEND TWO OUT OF THE THREE COMPANIONS
TO THE BLOCK WHERE NED WAS PANHANDLIN..

{*wolf howling*}

THEY JUMPED IN THE CAR (pedal to the metal)
Headed for the old train station (poor Ned's heartbeat's racin)
You can feel the tension in the air (wait stop the ride)
Ned seen a shadow by the boxcar (let's check inside)
Who wants to go first? (But nobody moved)
Ned so drunk he had no fear ("I'll go, y'all wait here!")
So he headed down the terminal (all the way to the rear)
As he looked back at the car (everybody had disappeared)
Uh-oh, something's wrong, that's around the corner
Noises comin from the boxcar (look like Ned's a goner)
That's when a hairy figure jumped from the train
(Shoulda seen Ned run, like a bat outta hell screamin the name)
"WOLFMAN JACK" - meanwhile back at the boxcar
(My man fell down to the ground he laughin so hard)
Pullin off his mask, sheddin tears from the joke
NED HAD NO IDEA IT WAS A HOAX
All alone standin - my man yelled
("He's gone, y'all can come out now") to his two companions
No reply, five minutes go by
("Oh what, y'all tryin to scare me now? Nice try!")
Approachin the ride, no sign of the two guys
He screamed ("Man I'm out!") then he got inside
SUDDENLY, out the corner of his eye, (What the hell is this?!")
On the bloody backseat laid his two friends headless
WOLF MAN JACK STRIKES AGAIN
BRINGIN THIS STORY TO A END
JUST LIKE MY MAN AND HIS CREW
IF YOU LIKE TO CRY WOLF, THE SAME THING CAN HAPPEN TO YOU...
