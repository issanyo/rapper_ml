[Emcee(s): One Be Lo and Veks]

[Hook/Vocals: Stephanie Soul]

[Verse 1: One Be Lo]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I be
The giant, mic device is defiant.  In the faces
Of tyrants, I’m steady making a riot.  In the places
Of science, they study patients and clients.  In a nation
Divided, forever racist to migrants, election faces
The whitest.  Many angles realign, and they tell me, “Aim as
We’re flying.”  I ain’t saying they’re lying, but tight fist play all
Your buyers, sacrifice you like Christ and then baptize you
With crisis, take your weakness for kindness, so your leaders
Applied it when their eyes is on the prizes, Osiris, the ancient
Iris and actions full of surprises keeping candles
Ignited, mosquitos and typhoid icing, we peel your fingers
Twice and then grip a knife in your spinal, bloodthirsty
In Sprite that sort of bubble and rising like pop, conquer
The writer.  Minnesotas and Vikings, terrorists terror-
-izes, pictures, images, pirates, but I didn’t
Define it like mirror near a vampire.  Your medalist
Don’t bite it

[Hook: Stephanie Soul]
We got a lot to speak on
Not worried ‘bout your paper-chasing love
All that’s just
Cartoon
And we don’t play by your rules
We’re in this piece, making our true
All I can be
Is me

[Verse 2: Veks]
Uh, given the proper
Education without separation from meditation
We kept you waiting.  Yo, we’re ready for our vegetation
Found my independence song but not the declaration
Unless invasion is further than us from segregation
The racist in me racing, but why can’t we get adjacent?
Forget the nation they’re inking—let’s fix the reservation
I’m like a bomb, but the revolver is in detonation
My pen hits the paper like force of excessive penetration
‘Cause I get impatient with words to find the best equation
Y’all manifestation on my death’s destination
My head is aching, they’re trying to give me medication
I’m hesitating and seeing policemen with the head of Satan
While y’all out to be the next best and the next sensation
Hip hop, I’m up against the test to prevent inflation
Track’s demonstration of instrumental defamations
And my name quickly celebrating the elevations
What?
