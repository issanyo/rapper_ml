Man

I hit 'em with A

R
We gonna show
M
Y

We kill 'em away
With lyrical spray

Political world
We live in today
Lights, Camera, Cinema play

And police say we shouldn't complain
Cause niggas wit triggas would did us the same

Blow us away it's a typical day

So One Be Lo
The temperature stay

The summer is cold
The winter is late
I Spring before they fall in my way

The Lord work in mysterious ways
That man working for minimum wage
The poor get poor
The richer get prey
The minister paid
The middle decay

Father figures addicted astray
We miss him but hey, we're still in the game

Don't always believe what they literally say
You knocking boots?
I'm Italy way

Similar to paint
I fill in the blanks
I'm landing mines at enemy tanks
The image portray
Some lizard and snakes
But really it's him in that mirror display

All in my face
Invisible hate
Physically stuck in a miserable state

The biggest disgrace
Trump bigot debates
Bernie, Carson, Hilary race

Sippin' champagne
Cinnamon baked
The media say, the privileges same
This ain't about race so don't get in my lane

You're digging more graves
Lock us away
Clickety clank

The system fill and we're feeling betrayed
Send me a lemon
I'll send lemonade
Lemon rice chicken
Lemon meringue
Lemon I squeeze
And riddle ya brain

Lime
Light
I did it the same

Juice bars
Ba Binary Stars
Ma Molotovs
Ba Ba Ba Bars
Ba Ba Ba Bang

Triggers I aim
Both of us living, not living the same
Ask me how long I been in this game?
You cave man
Come live in my age
Since the beginning like Genesis page
Alpha-Omega unlimited ways
Eve and Adams gimme a break
Nuclear bang
Killing a page
Pen and grenade
Ba Ba Ba Bang
