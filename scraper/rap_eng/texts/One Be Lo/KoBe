Wait til I exhale my flows ability
The Dragon the fire the gold and shimmery
I burn with desire in cold assemblies
My voice through tha wire control the energy
MC OG Chicago and Sicily
Rap everywhere see me Rome like Italy
Microphones gets blown in close proximity
I don't stop kickin' these goals, without penalties
Show you how to make it when I zone out mentally
Make moves physically
Billin me you feelin me?
Liars, they wanna steal my whole identity
I rain on they' parades like the hole in Kennedy
Drop top, diamond in the back, solar energy
Global warming, penguins meet the centipedes
Wisdom, maybe you consider me
Ministry of dentistry
Menace to Society
Nobody denying me
