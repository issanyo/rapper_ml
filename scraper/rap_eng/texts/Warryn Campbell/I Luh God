I luh God
You don't luh God?
What's wrong with chu?

[Verse 1]
I don't think I could live no other way
Truth be told, I'm living how I wanna, aye
Now, I done seen them blessings in the modern day
The Lord I serve, He gives them to me everyday
I'm forgiven, I'm forgiven
See I done been forgiven, now I'm living
And when I say I love, I mean it
Cuz none of this means nothing if He comes and I miss Him shawty

[Verse 2]
You ain't got the money moving by yourself
And you know you did it with a lot of help
You know it's only One, it ain't nobody else
You got me talking strong
And I ain't rich, I'm talking wealth
See I'm forgiven, I'm forgiven
See I done been forgiven, now I'm living
And when I say I love, I mean it
Cuz none of this means nothing if He comes and I miss Him shawty

[Bridge]
Wanted you to fall
You remember? I do, I do
You could've lost it all
You remember? I do, I do
No one could throw you off
Oh He got you covered
Protect us from it all
That's what makes me love Him
I don't need a reason
To fall on my knees and
Tell Him how I feel in my heart
And let Him know

[Hook]
I luh God
You don't luh God?
What's wrong with chu?

[Ad lib: Big Shizz]
I love Him, I love Him
Love Him I Love Him I love Him...
