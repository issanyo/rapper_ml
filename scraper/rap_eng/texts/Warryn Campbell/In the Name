[Verse 1]
Babe, there's no other way I'd rather spend tomorrow
Than right next to you
Oh my baby, you could play them games, babe
But I know, you could have the world but you still can't buy this love, love, love, love
This love, love, love, love
This love
You can lie to yourself but your heart knows the truth

[Chorus]
In the name of love
Let your heart speak for you
In the name of love
No one's gonna lose
In the name of love
Someone's sayin' "I do"
In the name of love
In the name of love
Oh, oh
In the name of love

[Verse 2]
Babe, let's lead the way
Make everybody follow
Yeah that's what we do
My baby, every day is like champagne
Feel like I wanna dance in the rain
You gave me the world, all you wanted was this love, love, love, love
This love, love, love, love
This love
You can lie to yourself but your heart knows the truth

[Chorus]
In the name of love
Let your heart speak for you
In the name of love
No one's gonna lose
In the name of love
So I'm sayin' "I do"
In the name of love
In the name of love
Oh, oh
In the name of love

[Bridge]
Ooh when it feels this good
Forever just don't feel like it's enough
If you've been let down
You've finally found someone who lifts you up
You know I give you that real feel
That if you ain't got it I pay the bill feel
That O-Town love, my baby trill feel
And I do it, I do it in the name of love

[Chorus]
In the name of love
Let your heart speak for you
In the name of love
No one's gonna lose
In the name of love
So I'm sayin' "I do"
In the name of love
In the name of love

[Outro]
In the name, I'll do anything
In the name, in the name of love
In the game of love, so I'm sayin' I do
In the name of love
