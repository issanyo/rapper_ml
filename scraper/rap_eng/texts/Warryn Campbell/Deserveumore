[Verse 1]
Who, tell me who knows you better than I do
Said it out your own mouth
I ain't even gotta say it
You ain't gotta make an issue
I ain't tryna play the victim
I'm just tryna make this thing right, yeah
How could you think that I could ever be better without you
I mean, I can go a few months
But everyday girl I be missin' you
Me losin' you to another dude
I thought of it as so depressing
You know and I both know that we need this, that's why

[Chorus]
I'm explaining what I'm fighting for
Girl there's no one who deserves you more
So stop subscribing to those crazy thoughts
Cause there's no one who deserves you more
Who gave you love? Don't change on me
I'll go half-crazy if you choose to leave
That's why I'm explaining what I'm fighting for
Girl there's no one who deserves you more
Deserves you more

[Verse 2]
You don't often talk about it baby, but we know it's true
That you were insecure once
Cause someone really did you you dirty
But I encouraged you to make it through
Showed you special was a part of you
But you did the same for me too
So girl I thank you and I'm so thankful
For the times when we rise and we fall
The nights when laugh and we talk
Lets not break up, let's be grateful
That the strain of our arguments
Only brought us close in spite of it all

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
We spend more time on our problems instead of
Tryna work them out to get better
However, let's turn this negative into a positive
You believe in you and I
I feel there's a need to try
If I don't fight I'll regret it for the rest of my life

[Chorus]
