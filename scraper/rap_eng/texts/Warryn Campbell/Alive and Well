[Verse 1]
This life we live can be kinda crazy to me
Don't know what be going on
So much is going on

[Pre-Chorus]
Maybe it's the TV
Everything that I see
Cause some things are make believe
Cause some things make you believe
That if you get on the other side of the fence
That your life will be much better than it is

[Chorus]
But if you're a fat man
Be a happy fat man
And if you're a poor man
Then be a happy poor man
I'm not trying to sit and tell you not to better yourself
But if you're alive and well
Just be alive and well

[Verse 2]
This high society has got me wanting to be
Something that I am not
Want everything that I ain't got
Sometimes I wish that I could be someone other than me
But the fact still remains
Who I am will never change

[Pre-Chorus]
Maybe it's the TV, everything that I see
Cause some things are make believe
But some things make you believe
That if you get on the other side of the fence
That your life will be much better than it is

[Chorus]
But if you're a fat man
Be a happy fat man
And if you're a poor man
Then be a happy poor man
I'm not trying to sit and tell you not to better yourself
But if you're alive and well
Just be alive and well

[Bridge]
You are original
Ain't no others like you
So beautiful, special, wonderful too
And I know you wanna find a way to put a little extra on it
Ain't nothing wrong with trying to be more than
Who and what you are

[Chorus]
But if you're a fat man
Be a happy fat man
And if you're a poor man
Then be a happy poor man
I'm not trying to sit and tell you not to better yourself
But if you're alive and well
Just be alive and well
But if you're a fat man
Be a happy fat man
And if you're a poor man
Then be a happy poor man
I'm not trying to sit and tell you not to better yourself
But if you're alive and well
Just be alive and well

[Outro: Scatting]
