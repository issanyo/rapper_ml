You and me were like one
But did we just have too much
Too much in common
We were so in love
But not enough
Cause now we both

Might as well have come from outer space
Cause we don't even know where we are
And we're both so out of place
From so close
And now so far
Cause it's all gone

You and me were like two
People who just knew
We were supposed to be
Be with each other
But neither of us could see
Cause we thought we were so happy
But the one I called my friend

Might as well have been from outer space
Cause I don't remember who you are
And we're both so out of place
From so close
But now so far
Cause it's all gone

And I wish that things could be the way they used to be
Heaven knows I do
But we're all tried out
So this is where we end
Cause for us to start again
Is like a man without a ship

Trying to go to outer space
When we know we won't get far at all
Cause now we're both so out of place
We were so close we almost had it all

We might as well be in outer space
Cause we don't know where we are
All we know is we're so out of place
How did we come so far
From the love...
