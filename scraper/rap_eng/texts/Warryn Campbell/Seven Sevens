Seven seven seven seven seven seven seven...

When I'm sleep I always dream we're together
I try to make it last, but I gotta wake up
Then you reappear when I'm in the mirror
Putting on my makeup
I want you bad
Feels like I've been waiting my whole life
And it's so sad
You're not here with me yet

[Chorus:]
Do you think 'bout me?
'Cause I've been thinking 'bout you?
Do you think 'bout me?
'Cause I've been thinking 'bout you?
Why don't you call me?
Seven seven seven seven seven seven seven
(I never change my number, it's still)
Seven seven seven seven seven seven seven
(Oh, call me)

[Verse 2:]
It's hitting me like a forty-foot wave
Ain't heard from you it feels like a thousand days
Didn't think anybody could make me feel this crazy
I believe it now
I been staring at the ceiling all night
Wishing you were around
Looking at my phone right now
Wondering how...

[Chorus:]
Do you think 'bout me?
'Cause I've been thinking 'bout you?
Do you think 'bout me?
'Cause I've been thinking 'bout you?
Why don't you call me?
Seven seven seven seven seven seven seven
(I never change my number, it's still)
Seven seven seven seven seven seven seven
(Oh, call me)

Seven...
Seven seven seven...
Yeah...

Feels like I'm floating in space
Wondering when I'll see your face
I can't wait
'Cause I've been thinking

[Chorus]

Oh, I've been thinking
Baby, oh, I need you baby
Oh baby
I can't stop thinking a...

[Chorus]

...'bout you baby, about...
Do you think about me like I think about you baby?
Ooh, ooh, baby, I been waiting for you call
I can't wait to hear your voice
