(Featuring Floetry)

My morning night and noon
My very I'll be back soon
My star up in the sky
My I just call to say hi

My world you want to eat now
My baby come rub my feet
My girls, you understand
I'm talking about my man, who

1 - Takes me higher, loves me better
Holds me closer, my man
I'm talking 'bout my man

Rocks me gently, kiss me plenty
Holds me closer, my man
I'm talking 'bout my man

He puts a smile on my face
He knows everything that I like
He got me open
I love him, I need him believe in, trust in his heart

My intelligent thug
My necessary hug
My I apologize
My I'm sorry, you was right

My I'm gonna give you more
My what you want from the store
My girls, you understand
I'm talking 'bout my man
