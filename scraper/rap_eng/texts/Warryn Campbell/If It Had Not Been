If it had not been for the Lord
I don't know
If it had not been for the Lord
I don't know
I can't take no credit for where I am today
That would be silly of me
But I've been guilty of getting beside myself
Doin things my way
Makin a mess I confess
That I'm so undeserving ya'll
No I'm not worthy at all
For some reason He chose me
To be a voice for Him
To make some noise for Him
Clearly He saw somethin I didn't see
If it had (had) not (not) been (been) for the Lord
(I don't know) I don't know (don't know)
If it had (had) not (not) been (been) for the Lord (for the Lord)
I don't know (Ohhhhh)
Could have been the topic of some breakin news
But He kept His hand on my life
And sometimes I forget to say thank you
For the things that He's done
Like giving His son
So undeserving ya'll
No I'm not worthy at all
For some reason He chose me
To be a voice for Him
To make some noise for Him
Clearly He saw somethin I didn't see
If it had (not) not (not been oooo) been for the Lord (for the Lord)
I don't know (ehhhh)
If it had (had not been) not been for the Lord (the Lord)
I don't know (don't know)
I know what I'm talking bout
Take little voice and open your mouth
Tell Him have you waited for the Lord
Excuse me that's what I was made for
If it had (had) not (not) been (been) for the Lord (for the Lord)
I don't know (don't know where I would be)
If it had (had not been Ohhho) not been for the Lord
(I don't like to think about it don't know where I'd be without Him)
I don't know
If it had (uh) not (oh) been (been) for the Lord (Oooo)
I don't know (don't know where I would be)
If it had (oo) not (oo) been (been) for the Lord (for the Lord)
I don't know (I don't know but I'm glad he did)
