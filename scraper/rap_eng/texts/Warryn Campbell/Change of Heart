[Chorus:]
Never knew how much I loved you
Until I saw you with someone
I took for granted
Always thought it'd be me and you
Now you had a change of heart
Never knew how much I needed you
Until you gave away my love
Didn't appreciate anything you did for me
That's why you had a change of heart

[Verse 1:]
Monday morning got a wake up call
Came as a surprise to me
My cousin got me on a late night show
Me and my man, we gon' be on TV
Hang up the phone and call my friends
Walk to the mall and find a 'fit
See my man is going out with another girl
Don't know if I can handle it

[Chorus]

[Verse 2:]
Fun is over, now we're on the show
She's cuter than I thought she'd be
I ain't tripping 'cause I know for sure
That my man is coming home with me
I chose "together," thought I knew his answer
Then come to find out
His card says he wants her!

[Chorus] (2x)

[Rap:]
My side of the story
Now when we first met
I admit it, I was with it
I ain't in it just to hit it, think about it for a minute
I was in it for the long run
And maybe we can talk about it when the show's done
Yeah, right!
You read the card, "Change of Heart!"
It's over
So don't be calling me tomorrow
Inviting me over
I'm out the door for sure
Gone in the wind
Impala 2000, twenty twen-twen
I ain't looking back
I ain't reminiscing at all
I'm in breeze with the palm trees, switches and all
All in all, all that can't replace you
Love for you like jail, can't escape you
Change of heart

[Chorus] (2x)

Never knew how much I loved you
(I loved you, I loved you)
I took for granted
Always thought it'd be me and you
(Me and you, me and you)
Never knew how much I needed you
Until you gave away my love
Didn't appreciate anything you did for me
That's why you had a change of heart
