[Verse 1:]
So... you...
Just found out that your new boyfriend got a baby mama
(What you gon' do?)
Do you love him enough to deal with the drama?
(Does he love you?)
Does he love you enough to give you a diamond?
(Say yes or no)
If the answer is no then he ain't the right one
So you should

[Chorus:]
Ooh, tell you what you should do
If you can't get no Act Right
From your girlfriend or boyfriend
Keep it movin'
Uhhh, hang up the phone and
Uhhh, change all your numbers
And the locks on the doors
Drop 'em off and keep it movin'!

[Verse 2:]
So you got you a girl that's a little insecure?
(What you gon' do?)
She don't trust you enough and won't let you breathe
(Does she love you?)
Would she love you if you had no money, honey?
(Say yes or no)
If the answer is no, you gotta let her know
That she got to go
(you should...)

[Chorus:] (2x)
Ooh, tell you what you should do
If you can't get no Act Right
From your girlfriend or boyfriend
Keep it movin'
Uhhh, hang up the phone and
Uhhh, change all your numbers
And the locks on the doors
Drop 'em off and keep it movin'!

[Bridge:]
When every conversation turns into an argument (ulgh!)
When every dime you make is a dime you spend (Ooh!)
Staying together don't seem to make no sense
Guess that's the perfect time to keep it moving

[Chorus]

Act right!
Oh, keep it movin'!
Hang up the phone and change all your numbers!

[Vamp:]
Your girl gets down on your last nerve
She thinks you got money to burn
It's all about her toes, her nails, her perm
She gots to keep movin'
You man thinks you ain't goin' nowhere
Treats ya like he don't even care
Got baby mamas everywhee
He gots to keep movin'

[Chorus] (2x)

Tell you what you should do...
Can't get no?
Ohh keep it, keep it movin'
Hang up the phone and
Change all your numbers
Drop 'em off an keep it movin'!
Just keep it movin'
Hang up the phone and
Change all your numbers

Oooh. (Ohhh!)
