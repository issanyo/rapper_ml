[Verse 1]
Ain't nobody stoppin' my shine
They try to break me try to take me out
But I got Jesus on my side
Felt so bad I thought I would die
But ain't no power stronger than the one
That came and laid down his life
And I got mountains to climb
But the enemy can't stop me
'Cause there's a calling on my life
So, when I'm crying, don't last too long
'Cause he's gon' step in and make it alright

[Chorus]
Won't He do it?
He said He would
Fight your battles for you
They gon' wonder how you sleep at night
Won't He do it?
Ah yes, He will
Anybody tell you something different
You know that's a lie
You gon' look back and be so amazed
How it turned out
It's only His grace
Won't He do it?
He said He would
So, I trust Him at all times

[Verse 2]
I'm about to lose it again
I'm about to let them know where I'm from
Don't take me there again
I just call on Jesus, my friend
Get me back in line one more time
'Cause he's always listening
Ain't nobody perfect, everybody's hurting
I need your whisper Lord, save me from my weaknesses
'Cause you're always on time
Come and get your breakthrough
'Cause I'm gonna get mine

[Chorus]
Won't He do it?
He said He would
Fight your battles for you
They gon' wonder how you sleep at night
Won't He do it?
Ah yes, He will
Anybody tell you something different
You know that's a lie
You gon' look back and be so amazed
How it turned out
It's only His grace
Won't He do it?
He said He would
So, I trust Him at all times

[Bridge]
See what the enemy had planned for my downfall
Turned out to be the greatest victory of my life
'Cause when it comes at you fast and hard
There's the only one that can come and make it right
So, ain't no need for stressing and crying
'Cause he gon' show up just like He did the last time
And the last time
And the last time
I know, I know, I know, I know
(Won't he do it?)

[Chorus]
Won't He do it?
He said He would
Fight your battles for you
They gon' wonder how you sleep at night
Won't He do it?
Ah yes, He will
Anybody tell you something different
You know that's a lie
You gon' look back and be so amazed
How it turned out
It's only His grace
Won't He do it?
He said He would
So, I trust Him at all times

[Outro]
Won't he do it? He said he would (All times, all times)
So, I trust Him at all times (All times, all times)
All times, all times
So, I trust Him at all times (All times, all times)
All times, all times
So, I trust Him at all times
All times, all times
So, I trust Him at all times
