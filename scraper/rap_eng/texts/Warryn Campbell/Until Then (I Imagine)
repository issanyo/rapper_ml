[Verse 1: Jill Scott]
I’m your kitty cat
Love what we do
I adore the taste of every thought of you
You’re so strong and so pure
Got me dickmatized and I want some more
Talk strong daddy
Control your girl
Oh, yea you got it
You’re so thorough
You leave me in a frenzied state
And I can’t wait
Til then I imagine

[Chorus:]
I imagine myself on my knees
Waiting for you to come over and see me (When I need to feel sexy)
I imagine myself on my knees
Waiting for you to come over and need me (When I need to put it on)
I imagine myself on my knees
Waiting for you to come over and feed me (All I gotta do is recall)
I imagine myself on my knees
Waiting for you to come over and free me

[Verse 2: Jill Scott]
I’m your lioness in the jungle babe
And I’m hungry now
And it’s you I crave
I drink you my suga
Consume your soul
Cause you give permission for me to let go
Oh, oh, oh, oh oh, oh
Where you going
I don’t know man
But you take me to another place
And I can’t wait
Until then I imagine

[Chorus]
I imagine myself on my knees
Waiting for you to come over and see me (When I need to feel sexy)
I imagine myself on my knees
Waiting for you to come over and need me (When I need to put it on)
I imagine myself on my knees
Waiting for you to come over and feed me (All I gotta do is recall)
I imagine myself on my knees
Waiting for you to come over and free me


[BRIDGE: Jill Scott]
Do me real quiet daddy
Just like that
Let me know where you’re heads at
Feelin’ that
Confidence is key
Not every man can handle a woman just like me
I can be with you all of me
Submissive dominant freaky
Cause when I blackout
And then I come back
You still meet me in the eye
And you’re still hittin’ that
Oh, oh, oh, oh, ohhh
Hey

[Chorus]
I imagine myself on my knees
Waiting for you to come over and see me (When I need to feel sexy)
I imagine myself on my knees
Waiting for you to come over and need me (When I need to put it on)
I imagine myself on my knees
Waiting for you to come over and feed me (All I gotta do is recall)
I imagine myself on my knees
Waiting for you to come over and free me (All I gotta do is recall)


(Jill Scott speaking)
