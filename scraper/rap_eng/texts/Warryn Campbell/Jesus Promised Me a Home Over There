There's a place, in Heaven
Prepared for me
When the toils o this life is over
When the saints are clothed in white
Before the throne
Singin praises forever forever more

In my fathers house
There are mansions bright
If he said it
Then I know it's true
There's a place for me
Beyond beyond the sky
Brothers & sisters there's one for you

Jesus he promised me a home over there
Jesus promised me a home over there
No more sickness, sorrow, pain, because
He promised me a home over there

Oh Jesus promised me a home over there
Jesus promised me a home over there
No more sickness, or sorrow, pain, again
Jesus promised me a home over there
