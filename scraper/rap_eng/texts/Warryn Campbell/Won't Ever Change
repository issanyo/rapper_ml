(All the things... we stress about everyday... glad to have one thing... that just don't change...)

[Chorus]
You know I'm here
Always, forever
Don't matter, what happens
I'm gonna stay the same

Your life, you live it
Don't waste, it trippin'
My love, I'll give it
And it will never change

[Verse 1]
Question after question, always wondering and guessin'
Is there anyone that will love me for me?
Someone who will help me, lead, guide and direct me
That's just what I need and I heard you so clearly say...

[Chorus] x2

Want a different life, don't like the one you have
You tried and wished and all that did don't seem to help
Can't be mad at the world, someone else is in those shoes
Then a voice says "believe in Me because I believe in you"
'cause...

[Pre-chorus]
A little faith and a, a little love and a, a little hope in the, the one above
Is all you really need to make it in this life so just keep listening to that voice deep inside saying..

[Chorus] x4
