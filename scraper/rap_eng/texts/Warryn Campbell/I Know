[Chorus:]
I know that you want my man
I know you been making plans
I know you wanna be me
You know it will never be

You thought you had be fooled
Thought I didn't have a clue
All along
I knew the truth
And now the joke's on you

Don't think
That I don't see you looking
Cause it's so obvious
When you come around
That you wanna start blushing and touching

I see the way
That you're checking him
You must be outta mind to ever think
That he would wanna leave me

I know that you want my man
I know you been making plans
I know you wanna be me
You know it will never be

You thought you had be fooled
Thought I didn't have a clue
All along
I knew the truth
And now the joke's on you

How long will you keep on trying?
You just keep on flirting
Trying to get him open

But it's all in game
Cause he ain't believing
Tell you what you should do
Find someone who wants you

I know that you want my man
I know you been making plans
I know you wanna be me
You know it will never be

You thought you had be fooled
Thought I didn't have a clue
All along
I knew the truth
And now the joke's on you

I know you wanna be in my shoes
But you can't do
What I do
You'll never be the woman I am
And he's much too much man for you

Can you tell me why you want a man
That's already someone's man
Fix it
It's out of your hands
Time to stop this
Cause it's getting out of hand

I know that you want my man
I know you been making plans
I know you wanna be me
You know it will never be

You thought you had be fooled
Thought I didn't have a clue
All along
I knew the truth
And now the joke's on you
