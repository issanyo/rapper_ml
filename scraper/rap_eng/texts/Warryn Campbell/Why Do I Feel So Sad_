[Verse 1]
Sometimes I wish I could cry
Only emptiness inside
So I sigh
'Cause I have to say bye-bye

[Chorus]
But I wish that I could stay
But like the seasons, everything must change
And it shouldn’t be so bad
So why do I feel so sad?
So sad, so sad

[Verse 2]
How can I get used to this?
The thought of you not being here
It's killing me
How I long for us to be
Just how we used to be

[Chorus]
But I wish that I could stay
But like the seasons, everything must change
And it shouldn't be so bad (be so bad)
So why do I feel so sad?
So sad, so sad

[Bridge]
If I could stay, I would
He’d never be sick of me, yeah
'Cause you are every day
I'm blind, so I must say
That the best thing to do is to go our separate ways

[Chorus]
But still I wish that I could stay
But like the seasons, everything must change
And it shouldn't be so bad (shouldn't be so bad)
So why do I feel so sad?
I could stay (I don't know)
Like the seasons, everything must change, yeah
And it shouldn't be so bad (so, so bad)
So why do I feel so sad?
I could stay (Wish I could stay)
Like the seasons, everything must change, must change
Be so bad...
