You're telling all your friends
That you don't have a clue
About what is going on
But when you know you do
So why you hide from your responsibility
When i gave you all of me
I gave you all of me

Why you wanna run from me?
Like i'm the police
Ever since i had your baby
It's like you don't know me
You said you'd be there for me
Now you wanna play dumb
The kid is still your son

Why you wanna run from me?
Like i'm the police
Ever since i had your baby
It's like you don't know me
You said you'd be there for me
Now you wanna play dumb
The kid is still your son

The guilt is killing you
I see it on your face
You're thinking how could i
Deny my own baby
But it's all good
Cause i'll be okay
Don't really need you now
I'm taking daddy's place

Why you wanna run from me?
Like i'm the police
Ever since i had your baby
It's like you don't know me
You said you'd be there for me
Now you wanna play dumb
The kid is still your son

Why you wanna run from me?
Like i'm the police
Ever since i had your baby
It's like you don't know me
You said you'd be there for me
Now you wanna play dumb
The kid is still your son

You told me not to worry about a thing
But nine months later everything's changed
You think you got the right to try and clown
But what goes around comes around, oh

Why you wanna run from me?
Like i'm the police
Ever since i had your baby
It's like you don't know me
You said you'd be there for me
Now you wanna play dumb
The kid is still your son
