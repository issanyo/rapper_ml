Here it is...

[Verse 1]
She caught me by surprise, I must say
'Cause I never have seen a pretty face
With such a warm and beautiful smile
It wasn't hard for me to notice her style

I was fascinated surely
She took my heart and held it for me
I wouldn't let her get away
Not until she heard me say...

[Chorus]
Excuse me miss, but what's your name?
Where are you from, and can I come?
And possibly, can I take you out tonight?
To a movie, to the park
I'll have you home, before it's dark
So let me know
Can I take you out tonight?

[Verse 2]
Don't care if I get rejected
At least then I won't regret
Regret the fact I missed the chance for romance, at least
I'll walk away knowing, I tried my best and I'm going
I'm going on with my day
'Cause at least she heard me say...

[Chorus]
Excuse me miss, but what's your name?
Where are you from, and can I come?
And possibly, can I take you out tonight?
To a movie, to the park
I'll have you home, before it's dark
So let me know
Can I take you out tonight?

Excuse me miss, but what's your name?
Where are you from, and can I come?
And possibly, can I take you out tonight?
To a movie, to the park
I'll have you home, before it's dark
So let me know
Can I take you out tonight?

[Bridge]
That's why I had to come over
And introduce myself to you
'Cause you're never gonna know where you find love
And hopefully, I'll find it in you

[Chorus]
Excuse me miss, but what's your name?
Where are you from, and can I come?
And possibly, can I take you out tonight?
To a movie, to the park
I'll have you home, before it's dark
So let me know
Can I take you out tonight?

Excuse me miss, but what's your name?
Where are you from, and can I come?
And possibly, can I take you out tonight?
To a movie, to the park
I'll have you home, before it's dark
So let me know
Can I take you out tonight?
(Let me make your house a home, baby)

Excuse me miss, but what's your name?
Where are you from, and can I come?
And possibly, can I take you out tonight?
To a movie, to the park
I'll have you home, before it's dark
So let me know
Can I take you out tonight?
