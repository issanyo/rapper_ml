[Verse 1]
It’s his way of living
Who am I to tell him
That what he’s doing just ain’t right
Standing on the corner hustlin’
All day gamblin’ under the street lights

Even though he’s thuggin’
I love him
And I want him in my life

[Chorus]
No matter what people say
I’m gonna love him anyway
Cause he does a lot for me
And that is why I’m gonna be

A lover
A friend
A soldier ’til the end
And that’s how it’s gonna be

[Verse 2]
Mother and my father don’t understand me
They think I messed up my life
But I don’t agree
They need to mind their business ‘
Cause it’s my life

And even though he’s thuggin’
I love him
(She loves him)
And I want him in my life (life)

[Chorus]
No matter what people say
I’m gonna love him anyway
Cause he does a lot for me
And that is why I’m gonna be

A lover
A friend
A soldier ’til the end
And that’s how it’s gonna be

[Bridge]
So what you sayin’
I can’t love him
Cause he’s a hustler out here thuggin’

I know you’re waiting
Sitting around hoping
That 5-0 come and take him away
Well, even if they do
I’ll remain true to love him in the end

Said I’ll be a lover
A friend
A soldier ’til the end
And that’s how it’s gonna be, yeah



[Chorus x2]
No matter what people say
I’m gonna love him anyway
Cause he does a lot for me
And that is why I’m gonna be

A lover
A friend
A soldier ’til the end
And that’s how it’s gonna be

No matter what people say
I’m gonna love him anyway
Cause he does a lot for me
And that is why I’m gonna be

A lover
A friend
A soldier ’til the end
And that’s how it’s gonna be
