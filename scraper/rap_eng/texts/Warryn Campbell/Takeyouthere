[Verse 1]
Oh, when I think of you
I can't see you like all the other girls I knew
That I didn't treat right but then
There are times when I just need what I need babe
And I know you can give it all to me
So how about

[Hook]
We don't have to go all the way, no
But if you want I still can take you there
(There, there)
Hey, baby, how about?
We don't have to go all the way, no
But girl, I'm sure you still can get me there
(There, there)

[Verse 2]
Oh, if only you knew what I'm willing to do (for)
For a fair exchange, baby from me to you
But I know, I know you've got your own reasons
For making me wait and I know
I know there's a way that we can free ourselves

[Hook]
We don't have to go all the way, no
But if you want I still can take you there
(There, there)
Hey, baby, how about?
We don't have to go all the way, no
But girl, I'm sure you still can get me there
(There, there)

[Bridge]
It's alright you can
Admit that you want it as bad as I
It's all natural
We all have our days and our sleepless nights
When we wanna get some
And I wanna get some
(Take you there)

It's alright you can
Admit that you want it as bad as I
It's all natural
We all have our days and our sleepless nights
When we wanna get some
And I just wanna get some

Hey, hey
Hey, hey
Hey, hey
Hey, hey

[Outro]
