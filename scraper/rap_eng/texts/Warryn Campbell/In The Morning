[Chorus:]
In the morning, you'll be alright
In the morning, sun's gonna shine
In the morning, no clouds in the sky
When it's dark in your life, just wait for the daylight

[Verse 1: Erica Campbell]
Someone tell me what's wrong
Why my nights pass alone
It's getting hard to believe you can hear me
Then you give me a sign
That you heard me pray
You let me know
These darken nights won't last always
Cause'...

In the morning, you'll be alright
In the morning, sun's gonna shine
In the morning, no clouds in the sky
When it's dark in your life, just wait for the daylight

[Verse 2: Tina Campbell]
So many ups and downs
You don't know where to start
So many nights you cry, life was breakin your heart
It may seem real hard
Ain't no help inside
But don't you worry about it tonight cause...

[Chorus: (2x)]
In the morning, you'll be alright
In the morning, sun's gonna shine
In the morning, no clouds in the sky
When it's dark in your life, just wait for the daylight

[Verse 3:]
Theres gonna be a day, its gonna get cloudy
You can't see clear [you can't see clearly no]
But don't you stop prayin
Praying for the day when the sun will shine, shine the day

[Chorus: (3x)]
In the morning, you'll be alright
In the morning, sun's gonna shine
In the morning, no clouds in the sky
When it's dark in your life, just wait for the daylight

[Outro:]
It'll be [It'll be]
Alright [Alright]
Just wait awhile [Wait awhile]
Check it out in the morning [Check it out in the morning]
Check it out in the morning

In the morning, no clouds in the sky
When it's dark in your life, just wait for the daylight
