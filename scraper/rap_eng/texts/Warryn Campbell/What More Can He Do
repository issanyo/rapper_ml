What more can he do
Tell me
What more can he do
He sends loving arms down from the sky
'cause He cares so much for you & I

Never in my imagination
Did I ever see so clearly
That someone has so much concern for my life
Dear love came & found me
Loved me when I didn't even love myself
I love that it will be there
When there's nobody else
So with my voice
I'll sing this little song of praise
'cause when I think of all He's done
All I can say

What more can he do
Tell me
What more can he do
He sends loving arms down from the sky
'cause He cares so much for you & I

What more can he do
Tell me
What more can he do
He sends loving arms down from the sky
'cause He cares so much for you & I

Really didn't ever reason
To love me so much right from the start
I haven't done a lot of things that I'm proud of
But that is just the way of Your love
"Why me" Is what I keep on askin' myself
Just could've givin' this gift to anyone else
But You made me realize that I was special too
& that is something that You didn't have to do

What more can he do
Tell me
What more can he do
He sends loving arms down from the sky
'cause He cares so much for you & I

What more can he do
Tell me
What more can he do
He sends loving arms down from the sky
'cause He cares so much for you & I

Don't know why he love me (love me)
Don't know why he care (he care)
Even though I really didn't deserve it
I'm still glad that He did

Don't know why he love me (don't know why)
Don't know why he care (don't know why)
Even though I really didn't deserve it
I'm still glad that He did

What more can he do
Tell me
What more can he do
He sends loving arms down from the sky
'cause He cares so much for you & I
(Repeat till end)
