[Chorus]
Wade in the water
Wade in the water, children
Wade in the water
Don't you know that God's gonna trouble the water?
Don't you know that God's gonna trouble the water?

[Verse 1]
I stepped in water, and the water was cold
(Don't you know that God's gonna trouble the water?)
Said it chilled my body, but not my soul
(Don't you know that God's gonna trouble the water?)
Wade...

[Chorus]
Wade in the water
Wade in the water, children
Wade in the water
Don't you know that God's gonna trouble the water?
Don't you know that God's gonna trouble the water?

[Verse 2]
Well, I went to the water one day to pray
(Don't you know that God's gonna trouble the water?)
And my soul got happy, and I stayed all day
(Don't you know that God's gonna trouble the water?)
Help me sing

[Chorus]
Wade in the water
Wade in the water, children
Wade in the water
Don't you know that God's gonna trouble the water?
Don't you know that God's gonna trouble the water?
Don't you know that God's gonna trouble the water?
God's gonna trouble...
