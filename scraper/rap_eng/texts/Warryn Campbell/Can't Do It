[Intro]
Hey, baby
I was just calling to say that I love you
But some times I...
I really don't know what to do with you

[Verse 1]
I take it personally
When he don't answer my calls
And I hear your attitude
And it feel like I really hate him
But he ain't perfect
But he's so perfect for me
I know that this relationship
We've got, it be so crazy
I say things, he say things
But we don't really mean it
And when I feel like to leave my baby...

[Chorus]
I can't do it (can't do it)
Sometimes I wanna leave but I can't do it
If said I didn't love you, I'd be lying (can't do it)
He's so smart and just a little hurt (can't do it)
Should be a cinch to be feeling this good

[Verse 2]
He gets on my last nerve
And he acts so nonchalant
And sometimes I wonder why I even bother
Next thing I know we're all over each other
I like to get it, oh, I like to get it
He like to get it, oh, he like to get it
I your mad, he, your mad
But then we get over it
So you can't even really
Tell me nothing about it 'cause...

[Chorus]
I can't do it (can't do it)
Sometimes I wanna leave but I can't do it
If said I didn't love you, I'd be lying (can't do it)
He's so smart and just a little hurt (can't do it)
And it should be a cinch to be feeling this good

[Bridge]
Oh, I'm holding on 'cause I love him than anyone
And I feel like I need to
To explain the reasons why

[Chorus]
I can't do it
Sometimes I wanna leave but I can't do it
If said I didn't love you, I'd be lying (can't do it)
He's so smart and just a little hurt (can't do it)
And it should be a cinch to be feeling this good
Can't do it, do it, can't do it, do it
Can't do it, do it, can't do it, do it
