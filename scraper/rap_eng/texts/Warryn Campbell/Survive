[Verse 1: Tina]
"Any day now," is what I kept telling myself
On the last mile, on the road to somewhere
But along the way I (got stopped by)
All the wind and the rain and
To my surprise (they knew my name)

[Pre-Hook]
And it shook my heart
Blew my mind
I've had to cry so many nights
I've had to hold on for my life
But all I can say now is that I survived

[Hook]
I survived, I survived, I survived
I survived, I survived, I survived
Oh, You know I had a lot on me
Truth be told, it almost broke me
But I'm so glad
I survived, I survived, I survived now

[Verse 2: Erica]
Now hurt and pain were sometimes my company
Separated from those, then I suppose
I didn't have no guarantees
But one thing, that I knew for sure was
That I've had my share of ups and downs
I made it even though

[Pre-Hook]
Oh, it shook my heart
Blew my mind
I've had to cry so many nights
I've had to hold on for my life
But all I can say now is that I survived

[Hook]
I survived, I survived, I survived
I survived, I survived, I survived
Oh, Lord I had a lot on me
Truth be told, it almost broke me
But I'm so glad
I survived, I survived, I survived now

[Bridge 1]
I know you heard this message before
I wanna tell you once more
It's alright
I know the road you're on might seem long
But I encourage you to hold on, hold on
You will survive
I do believe you will
But all I can say now is that I survived

[Hook]
I survived, I survived, I survived
I survived, I survived, I survived
Oh, You know I had a lot on me
Truth be told, it almost broke me
But I'm so glad
I survived, I survived, I survived now

[Bridge 2]
When the weight of the world's
All on your shoulder
Just remember, remember, remember
To keep your head up and survive

[Hook]
Oh, You know I had a lot on me
Truth be told, it almost broke me
But I'm so glad
I survived, I survived, I survived now

I survived, I survived, I survived
I survived, I survived, I survived
Oh, You know I had a lot on me
Truth be told, it almost broke me
But I'm so glad
I survived, I survived, I survived now
