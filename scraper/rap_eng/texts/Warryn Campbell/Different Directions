[Verse 1]
One, two, what we gonna do now that we're done?
I know life goes on but we've been together for so long
We been through it all
We had the best sex, we had the worst fights
We had drama, but it made us stronger
And hopefully strong enough to go through life without each other

[Chorus]
In different directions, we learn our own lessons
In different directions, certain things must happen
What is meant to be will be, for you and for me
But the answer to our questions is in different directions

[Verse 2]
Three, four, I don't know what the future got in store
For both of us
But at least we can take with us all of the memories
Like the first kiss, and the first hug
Like the first time that we made sweet love
Oh so special, but now we got business to handle

[Chorus]
In different directions, we learn our own lessons
In different directions, certain things must happen
What is meant to be will be, for you and for me
But the answer to our questions is in different directions

[Bridge]
See, I'll never find u in him, and you'll never find me in her
It's just one of those life experience, a lesson learned
See, I'll never find u in him, and you'll never find me in her
It's just one of those life experience I have learned

[Chorus]
In different directions, we learn our own lessons
In different directions, certain things must happen
What is meant to be will be, for you and for me
But the answer to our questions is in different directions
