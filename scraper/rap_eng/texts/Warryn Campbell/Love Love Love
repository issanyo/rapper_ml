[Verse 1: Stevie Wonder]
Every morning I wake up
You’re the reason for my smile
Before I close my eyes
It’s you I’m thinking about
Every part of you
Loves every part of me
I never knew before
That this is how it could be

‘Cause I’m so satisfied, I’m amazed
I’m overjoyed in every way
It ain’t nothing like what I’m feeling
Ooh, it’s love

[Chorus]
Love, love, love (I’m in love)
Love, love, love (Yeah, I’m in love)
Love, love, love (Oh, I’m in love)

[Verse 2: Tina Campbell]
All of my fans
And all of my friends
My big old family
Especially my kids
My husband’s in his own class
He’s ahead of them all
But nobody can compare
To my savior God

‘Cause I’m so satisfied, I’m amazed
I’m overjoyed in every way
It ain’t nothing like what I’m feeling
Ooh, it’s good and it’s love

[Chorus]
Love, love, love (Yeah, yeah, yeah, love)
Love, love, love (Oh, that’s what it is)
Love, love, love (Love, love, love)
Love, love, love (Love, love, love)

[Bridge: Tina Campbell]
I thought it was too good to be true
It is better than anything I’ve known
When heaven opens and sends you a kiss, it’s so pure
And you’re sure that it’s real love

[Chorus]
Love, love, love (That’s what it is, love, ooh, yeah)
Love, love, love (Early in the morning, it’s love)
Love, love, love (That’s what it is)
Love, love, love (Oh, I’m in, I’m in…)
Love, love, love (I’m in love, love, love, love)
Love, love, love (Love, love, love)
Love, love, love (Yeah)

That’s what I’m in, y’all
Love, love, oh, ohhh
Yeah
