[Verse 1]
It's the only explanation to the question at hand
Like years of pain gone away in a single day
There's nothing that compares
To the way you make me feel inside
And I'm so glad you're my...

[Chorus]
Prince Charming, my angel, my king and my friend
My lover, my one
He is, he is
The beat in my heart, the kiss on my lips
My lover, my one
He is, he is

[Verse 2]
They could take away the money
My fortune and fame
But as long as you stay here with me
I would be okay
I look at you and I see me
Just reflections of the love you made with me
And I'm so glad you want to be my...

[Chorus]
Prince Charming, my angel, my king and my friend
My lover, my one
He is, he is
The beat in my heart, the kiss on my lips
My lover, my one
He is, he is

[Bridge]
My sun, my shine
My love, my life
He is everything I need
I gotta love you like no one has ever loved before
I gotta give you what you gave, baby, so much more
I wanna take it fast, but I want to take it slow
Addicted to your love and I can't let go

[Chorus]
Prince Charming, my angel, my king and my friend
My lover, my one
He is, he is
The beat in my heart, the kiss on my lips
My lover, my one
He is, he is
Prince Charming, my angel, my king and my friend
My lover, my one
He is, he is
The beat in my heart, the kiss on my lips
My lover, my one
He is, he is
Prince Charming, my angel, my king and my friend
My lover, my one
He is, he is
The beat in my heart, the kiss on my lips
My lover, my one
He is, he is
