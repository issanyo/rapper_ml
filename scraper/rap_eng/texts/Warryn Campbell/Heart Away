[Verse 1]
When you fall in love, it feels great
Make you feel like how it was back in the fifth grade
Then you hope and wish that the feeling never fades away
Cause when it does, all that love turns into pain

Then it makes it hard for you to try again
Now you're feeling that you never might again
Cause you couldn't wait it out
And take your time, try to find out who's the right one

[Pre-Chorus]
Some people don't listen
Heartbreak by admission
No one is responsible to protect your heart
Only fools go rushing
Hopelessly for nothing
Then get mad when everything falls apart

[Chorus]
You just can't give your heart away
No you just can't give your heart away
So don't just give your heart away
And away and away and away and away and away and away and away and away
Cause you just can't give your heart away
So don't just give your heart away
And away and away and away and away and away

[Verse 2]
Everybody wants to be loved (but you gotta be careful what you get into)
Cause everybody that you want (ain't necessary who you wanna let in, no)
So you go dating around (cause you need to)
Found someone who's down for now
(And now with your affection
Let's start with your protection
You gotta be selective) but

[Pre-Chorus]
Most people don't listen
Heartbreak by admission
No one is responsible to protect your heart
Only fools go rushing
Hopelessly over nothing
Then wanna get mad when everything falls apart

[Chorus]
You just can't give your heart away
No you just can't give your heart away
So don't just give your heart away
And away and away and away and away and away and away and away and away
Cause you just can't give your heart away
So don't just give your heart away
And away and away and away

[Bridge]
Don't get confused with what you feel for what is real
Cause that's how you end up hurting yourself
Don't get confused with what you feel for what is real
And just end up hurting yourself, yeah

[Chorus]
You just can't give your heart away
No you just can't give your heart away
So don't just give your heart away
And away and away and away and away and away and away and away and away
Cause you just can't give your heart away
So don't just give your heart away
And away and away and away and away
