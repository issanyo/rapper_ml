[Verse 1]
I used to think love was this game you could only lose
Some people just play way too much
That’s why I decided that the best thing for me to do
Was to leave love alone and live a single life
And I was doing just fine
Until now

[Chorus]
Now that I’ve got you
(I used to wanna be alone)
But I changed my mind
(It was all I left for you)
Now girl you got me thinking ’bout you
(All the time)
How is someone like you here with me
Cause I was looking for (nobody)
And now I'm falling in love, with you

[Verse 2]
I was the one always trying to keep everybody cool
It made me unhappy for years
But sometimes you just stick around 'til there’s no reason to stay anymore
So, when you go separate ways
I was so good 'til today
Until now

[Chorus]
Now that I’ve got you
(I used to wanna be alone)
But I changed my mind
(It was all I left for you)
Now girl you got me thinking ’bout you
(All the time)
How is someone like you here with me
Cause I was looking for (nobody)
And now I'm falling in love, with you

[Bridge]
You might say I must be crazy for just giving up on love
(If you can do without it, then you wouldn't believe in it)
Baby you turn everything around for me
’Cause I wasn’t ready for nothing like this
Falling in love was the furthest thing from my mind

[Chorus]
Now that I’ve got you
(I used to wanna be alone)
But I changed my mind
(It was all I left for you)
Now girl you got me thinking ’bout you
(All the time)
Now that I’ve got you
(I used to wanna be alone)
But I changed my mind
(It was all I left for you)
Now girl you got me thinking ’bout you
(All the time)
Now that I’ve got you
(I used to wanna be alone)
But I changed my mind
(It was all I left for you)
Now girl you got me thinking ’bout you
(All the time)
Now that I’ve got you
(I used to wanna be alone)
But I changed my mind
(It was all I left for you)
Now girl you got me thinking ’bout you
(All the time)
