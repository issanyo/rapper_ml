[Chorus]
Speak to me, Lord
Speak a word of life
That I might hear
What thus sayeth oh, God
It's the still small voice
That I wait for so
Speak to me, Lord

[Chorus (Erica)]
(Oh, we cry now)
Speak to me, Lord
Speak a word of life
That I might hear
(We need to hear)
What thus sayeth oh god
It's the still small voice
That I wait for so
Speak to me Lord

[Verse 1]
Searching everywhere cause we are looking for
The wheres, and whys, and hows to fill our deepest voids
But Your words, they bring all that we need so...
Speak to me, Lord

[Chorus (Tina)]
Speak to me, Lord
(Speak, Lord)
Speak a word of life
That I might hear
(What You said)
What thus sayeth, oh God
It's the still small voice
That I wait for so
Speak to me, Lord

[Verse 2]
Whether it be loud and clear
Or still and small
Whether it be much
Or short and simple
Whatever it may be just as long as you
Speak to me Lord

[Bridge (Both)]
Speak to me, Lord
(Where do I go from here)
Speak to me, Lord
(Lord, will You make it clear?)
Speak to me, Lord
(I wanna move to You)
(Speak to me)
Speak to me, Lord
(Lord I need Your direction)
Speak to me, Lord
(To make the right selection)
Speak to me, Lord
([?] Won't You speak?)
Speak to me, Lord
(Somebody needs to hear)
(Somebody needs to hear)
Speak to me, Lord
(Somebody needs to hear)
(Oh, we're listening)
