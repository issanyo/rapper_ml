[Verse 1]
Uh, just this moment when I woke up I turned on my radio
The DJ played my song, I got up, got dressed and ready to go
I thought about you so I called you right before I hit the road
Just to tell you that my life won't be the same without you

[Pre-Hook]
Cause when I wake up next to you
The sun shines so much brighter
And when I hear a song with you
It seems to take me higher
Just being with you is the truth
Without you, I'm a liar
So I wanna take this time to tell you what's on my mind
Just thought that you should know

[Hook]
Girl, with you here in my life
Everything that I thought was right was wrong
Babygirl you brought the light
Showed me that I was blind for so long
It's the little things you do
Its the reason why I'm rocking with you
Cause the way you make me feel
Is something real ridiculous

[Verse 2]
Baby, you be doing things for me that really (blows my mind)
You're not the selfish kind of lover, what's mine is yours, what's (yours is mine)
And even though you know I can't, if I had my way, I would be with you (all the time)
Girl, it amazes me the way that you have changed my life


[Pre-Hook]
Cause when I wake up next to you
The sun shines so much brighter
And when I hear a song with you
It seems to take me higher
Just being with you is the truth
Without you, I'm a liar
So I wanna take this time to tell you what's on my mind
Just thought that you should know

[Hook]
Girl, with you here in my life
Everything that  I thought was right was wrong
Babygirl you brought the light
Showed me that I was blind for so long
It's the little things you do
Its the reason why I'm rocking with you
Cause the way you make me feel
Is something real ridiculous

[Bridge]
Listen, girl, before you came around
I was always tryna get down
With almost every girl around the way
Like every day but now
Baby, you helped me to see
That you're everything that I need
You and me together, girl its so ridiculous

[Hook]
Girl, with you here in my life
Everything that  I thought was right was wrong
Babygirl you brought the light
Showed me that I was blind for so long
It's the little things you do
Its the reason why I'm rocking with you
Cause the way you make me feel
Is something real ridiculous

[Hook]
Girl, with you here in my life
Everything that  I thought was right was wrong
Babygirl you brought the light
Showed me that I was blind for so long
It's the little things you do
Its the reason why I'm rocking with you
Cause the way you make me feel
Is something real ridiculous
