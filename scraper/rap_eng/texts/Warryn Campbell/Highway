VERSE 1:
I love a fast car
And you got a fast ride
So won't u take me for a spin out on ya' highway
Cuz it's raining outside and
I know that a drive might sound a little crazy
But I feel that it's time

So speed it up, slow it down
Put it back, in reverse
My directions, pay attention to my every word
We can bump, we can swerve
But watch out for that curve
On ya' highway

CHORUS
Engines, roaring
Bodies, exploring
Hold on tight we're going all the way (all the way)
We can go 80 miles an hour
90 miles an hour
As long as you're driving then, it's ok
Cuz I love it riding on your highway

VERSE 2:
Now, let's take it nice and slow and
I'll tell you where to go
I'll whisper to you softly when I see the signs
I look over to see you
And you're checking out the rear view
I'll control the stick you drive between the lines (whoooaa)

So speed it up, slow it down
Put it back, in reverse
My directions, pay attention to my every word
We can bump, we can swerve
But watch out for that curve
On ya' highway

(CHORUS)

BRIDGE:
Take me to another place (somewhere)
Where you can touch my face (somewhere)
Where you can kiss my waist (somewhere)
That I can show you

(CHORUS)
