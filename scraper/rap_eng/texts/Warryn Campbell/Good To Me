[Intro: Warryn Campbell]
Yo, check it out
Yeah, we gon' do a little something different here
It's Mary Mary y'all, and Destiny's Child
Let me see you clap your hands
I wanna see you clap your hands
Let me see you clap your hands

[Chorus]
No, no, it ain't the way it used to be and
Yeah, yeah, it may be hard to believe
When, when, I think all my blessings
I, oh I, tellin' you God's been good to me

[Verse 1: Erica Campbell]
Growing up in a real big family
I had to take what I could get
There was always a sister or brother
I had to share everything with
I had to share my room, wear hand-me-downs
'Cause we didn't have much money
Now there's not much I long for
Tellin' you God's been good to me, oh no no

[Chorus]
No, no, it ain't the way it used to be and
Yeah, yeah, it may be hard to believe
When, when, I think all my blessings
I, oh I, tellin' you God's been good to me

[Verse 2: Kelly Rowland]
You may think I've got it easy
And that's the way it's always been
But that's not the story
I'll tell you how it all happened
I had to work real hard to get here
But I didn't do it all alone
Someone was watching over me
And that is why i sing this song, oh no

[Chorus]
No, no, it ain't the way it used to be and
Yeah, yeah, it may be hard to believe
When, when, I think about all my blessings
I, oh I, tellin' you God's been good to me

[Bridge]
If I began to count my blessings
I wouldn't know where to begin
God has done so much for me
He's been much more than a friend
He's a protector and provider
Though I didn't always know
Always been right beside me
And without him, where would I be?

Woo woo woo woo...
Been good to me, so good to me
So good to me, so good to me
Woo woo woo woo...
So good to me, so good to me
And it ain't the way it used to be, oh no

[Chorus]
No, no, it ain't the way it used to be and
Yeah, yeah, it may be hard to believe
When, when, I think about all my blessings
I, oh I, tellin' you God's been good to me

No, no, it ain't the way it used to be and
Yeah, yeah, it may be hard to believe
When, when, I think about all my blessings
I, oh I, tellin' you God's been good to me

No, no, it ain't the way it used to be and
Yeah, yeah, it may be hard to believe
When, when, I think about all my blessings
I, oh I, tellin' you God's been good to me
