Without the root, you ain't got no tree
And without the branches, you ain't got no leaves
To understand her is to understand me
Cause that's how close we are
Without a sea you ain't got no air
And it ain't no walkin if you ain't got the legs
Understand I use them eyes to see
That's how close we are

[Chorus:]
Heart to heart
Breath to breath
She fills me up til there ain't none left
No space, no time
Her spirits my mind
You see, that's how close we are
That's how close we are [x2]

Without the stars, there's no galaxy
And without the river, you don't have no sea
Just look at my life, and it's her you'll see
Cause that's how close we are
And without a voice no one can hear you sing
And it ain't no flying without the wings
So if you see me flying
It's her carrying me
That's how close we are

[Chorus:]
[breakdown]
She talks with me
She walks with me
She's holding me
And yes, she's teaching me
Everything I can't do
Everything I can't say
She does for me
She prays with me
She cries with me
She's loving me
Nothing could compare to the love we share
So that woman and man
Who understands
You can say:

Heart to heart
Breath to breath
She fills me up til there ain't none left
No space, no time
Her spirits my mind
You see, that's how close we are
That's how close we are [x11]
