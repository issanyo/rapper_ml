[Verse 1: Damani Nkosi]
It's like water for the body
Food for the soul
A feelin' you don't wanna let go
So let go 
And stop fightin' it
I even smile when I'm writin' bout it
It's the sun to my thoughts 
When clouds try to crowd it
I use to run from it 
I use to hide to 
I thought it made me soft
Plus I was hood to 
Its the beat to my heart 
So the rhythm of my life can dance in peace at night
I got my style just right 
I got my mind just right 
I got to tell you bout this thing make everything alright
Momma cookin wit it 
Pops teachin wit it
Dub made the track just so i can speak wit it
I got to have it everyday hour on the hour 
Minute by the second if you feel it its a blessin 
When ya feelins' get arrested and you ain't trynn break free
You've just been touched L.O.V.E
Now that's love

[Hook: Musiq Soulchild]
Love me in a special way 
What more can I say 
Love me now
Repeat

[Verse 2: Damani Nkosi]
For the Love
It was never for the bread 
It was always bout the passion that turned into a action
That inspired the masses
Never for the dough
If the money wasn't right 
He'd sing just to show 
How a ribbon in the sky suppose to go 
Stevie, the KG's, the Kobe's, the MJ's both of them
We all love them 
Serena and Venus B and J the JB's who played for James B
Say it loud
I'm Black and I'm proud of how we all get down when loves around
It's the love for the music that makes me not lose it
My actions is the proof the words get confusing
I was once saul who then turned to Paul
I'm trynna tell all y'all that love conquers all
Kings last speech was deep
He knew he would pass 
But he promised L.O.V.E. 
Now that's love

[Hook: Musiq Soulchild]
Love me in a special way 
What more can I say 
Love me now
Repeat

[Bridge: Damani Nkosi]
My loved ones 
My loved ones 
My loved ones
What up to all my loved ones
My loved ones 
My loved ones 
My loved ones
All I need is my loved ones

[Piano Solo: Robert Glasper]
