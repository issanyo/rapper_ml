[Hook]
Don't miss this moment don't let it pass you by
Don't miss this moment don't let it pass you by
Time keeps moving and it never rewinds
Don't miss this moment don't let it pass you by

[Interlude 1: Erica]
I gotta call Mama, find out what she wanted
Walk Kris to school, pay her tuition
Get some socks for Wozy
Get ready for this date with Warryn
Get my hair and nails done, then...
Krista! Put my phone down!

[Verse 1]
Tell me what you want, tell me what you see
Where you wanna go, what you wanna be
If you have a dream you can make it there with a lot of work
And a lot of prayer
If you take your time, gotta be precise, gotta have a plan
Double check it twice wait
Hold up, slow down, still gon' need advice
Someones gone before, maybe talk to them
Then after you do, go and talk to Him
Great is gonna come, maybe not tonight
Take your time today, futures looking bright

[Verse 2]
Got a lot of friends
Made a lot of ends
Twitter, you the trend
Beamer, Bentley, Benz
But, but, you're moving kinda fast
Keep [?], you gotta make it last
Live every day like it's your last
But don't forget to have a blast

[Hook]
Don't miss this moment don't let it pass you by
Don't miss this moment don't let it pass you by
Time keeps moving and it never rewinds
Don't miss this moment don't let it pass you by

[Interlude 2: Tina]
Let's see what I got
I got a rehearsal
I gotta go to the studio
Then I gotta get home in enough time to cook dinner
Then I ain't got no groceries, so I gotta go to the store to shop
And I gotta get some sleep cause I gotta be up early in the morning for an interview
I can't do everything
I need a vacation
