You know I'm in love like crazy
People wanna ask what's up, what's up
They say I'm doin' way too much, too much
I say I just can't get enough, enough

'Cause I'm in love like crazy
I tell it everywhere I go, I go
When they tell me not to rock the boat
But they need to know the you I know, I know
That I'm in love like crazy, yeah

Got me doin' things that I never thought I would
Like gettin' locked out of my car in the rain
It's silly but I say that it's all good
'Cause he never lets me walk alone
And he loves me even when I'm wrong
And knows how to make my day

You know I'm in love like crazy

Have you ever felt somethin' that you can't describe?
You don't even have to say a word 'cause it shows outside
My life is better just because of him
That's why even when I lose I win

So good I gotta say it again
My life is better just because of him
That's why even when I lose I win
And that's why I say

You know I'm in love like crazy

I will never have to wonder
Can I trust him? Will he leave me alone?
'Cause he shows me by wakin' me up every day
And he tells me in his word that he'll be with me always, that's why
