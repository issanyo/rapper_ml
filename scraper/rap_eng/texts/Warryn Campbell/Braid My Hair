[Verse 1]
When you look at me, I know you see
A 16-year-old, getting his dough
Back and fourth to the studios
Hopping out limousines, rocking the latest jeans
Jordan's, fresh
T-Shirt, new
And even though these things are true
It's hard work and sometimes I just want to go home
And tell my girl...

[Chorus]
Braid my hair
C'mon and braid my hair
Back in my hood, feeling good
No worries or no cares
Baby, use your hands
To make me feel alright
And take away the stress and drama in my life
While you braid my hair...

[Verse 2]
You may think that I'm complaining
But that's not the case, all I'm saying
Is my body gets weak, my mind gets tired
I need sleep, but I got to keep
Travelling on the road
Doing these shows
New York to Cali
Dallas to Philly
It's the rules of the game, that I chose to play
But sometimes I want to say
Baby won't you...

[Chorus]
Braid my hair
C'mon and braid my hair
Back in my hood, feeling good
No worries or no cares
Baby, use your hands
To make me feel alright
And take away the stress and drama in my life
While you braid my hair...

[Bridge]
Sit me down like you love me
Do it anyway you want
Baby take it slowly
Front to back, side to side, criss cross
Get creative with it girl, do your thing
Put it down like you love me
Let your fingers do the walking and your lips do the talking
In my ear
Tell me what I want to hear
I swear
I can't wait for you to braid my hair...

[Chorus]
C'mon and braid my hair
Back in my hood, feeling good
No worries or no cares
Baby, use your hands
To make me feel alright
And take away the stress and drama in my life
While you braid my hair...

Do what you want to do
Baby its up to you
Sit me between your legs
Girl won't you braid my hair
Baby make me feel alright
And make it last all night
And take away the stress and drama in my life
Won't you braid my hair...

[Chorus]
C'mon and braid my hair
Back in my hood, feeling good
No worries or no cares
Baby, use your hands
To make me feel alright
And take away the stress and drama in my life
While you braid my hair...
