[Verse 1]
Hey I've tried just about everything
Riches and fame, a lot of friends
A lot of luxuries
Underneath it all I've always felt so incomplete
I just want someone to really love and care for me
I do all I can to make people happy
But happiness in return is something I'll never see
Don't know why I'm going wrong trying to find what I need
So I'm crying Lord please help me, yeah

[Chorus]
When I gave Him my love
Here's what came back to me
He never ran with my affections
His love is guaranteed
Didn't know unconditional love
Could ever really be found
That didn't happen to somebody like me
I didn't know what I know now

[Verse 2]
Well since I found His love
I don't try to please nobody else
Cause in Him I found all I'll ever need
And He loves me just for me, Brandy
If you don't know Him you should give Him a chance
And He'll give you the best love you've ever had
You'll love Him like I do I don't have a doubt
Listen while I tell you what I'm talking 'bout

[Chorus]
When I gave Him my love
Here's what came back to me
He never ran with my affections
His love is guaranteed
Didn't know unconditional love
Could ever really be found
That didn't happen to somebody like me
I didn't know what I know now

[Bridge]
Sometimes it seems as though
Life isn't really fair at all
When the ones you try to love
Don't love you back, oh
But when you found the love
That I have found from God above
It erases all the pain of your past
Trying to tell you

[Chorus]
When I gave Him my love
Here's what came back to me
He never ran with my affections
His love is guaranteed
Didn't know unconditional love
Could ever really be found
That didn't happen to somebody like me
I didn't know what I know now

No, I didn't know, I didn't know
I didn't know, I didn't know
I didn't know, I didn't know
I didn't know, I didn't know
I didn't know, I didn't know
