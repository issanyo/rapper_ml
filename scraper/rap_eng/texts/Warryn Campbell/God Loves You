[Intro]
God loves you

[Chorus]
God loves you, even in your coldest days
God loves you, trust me it'll be okay
God loves you, girl God loves you
God loves you, even in your coldest days
God loves you, trust me it'll be okay
God loves you, girl God loves you

[Verse 1]
Hey, girl won't you come sit down
I can see the frown, wanna talk about it?
Since you've been with him
You ain't the same
Cause he's playing games
Think you're lost without him

[Pre-Chorus]
You pray for someone  who'd love you so
He played, never would you let him go
But the only love you need to know
Is God'll show you the love you're missing

[Chorus]
God loves you, even in your coldest days
God loves you, trust me it'll be okay
God loves you, girl God loves you
God loves you, even in your coldest days
God loves you, trust me it'll be okay
God loves you, girl God loves you

[Verse 2]
Oh, girl I can feel your pain
Cause I've been played the same
Ain't no doubt about it
Caught you slipping so you took the blame
Girl, it's the same old game
Don't be lost about it

[Pre-Chorus]
You pray for someone  who'd love you so
He played, never would you let him go
But the only love you need to know
Is God'll show you the love you're missing

[Chorus]
God loves you, even in your coldest days
God loves you, trust me it'll be okay
God loves you, girl God loves you
God loves you, even in your coldest days
God loves you, trust me it'll be okay
God loves you, girl God loves you

[Bridge]
Girl, just hold on
Just be strong
He'll lead you through the storm
Don't look back, he's your friend
Love's in need, trust in him cause...

[Chorus]
God loves you, even in your coldest days
God loves you, trust me it'll be okay
Trust me God loves you, girl God loves you
God loves you, even in your coldest days
God loves you, trust me it'll be okay
God loves you, girl God loves you
Girl, God loves you
