[Verse 1]
Turn the lamp on, let me talk to ya
See that light bulb, does something to ya
Makes it little harder, to tell a lie don't it
Make it difficult, to run and hide don't it
Told your truth to me, the truth to me
Come close to me, if that's you
I wanna see the details
Inside those beautiful eyes (Beautiful eyes)

[Pre-Chorus]
Myself ain't never talked to me like that before
And I wonder
What on earth is he searching for

[Chorus]
No wonder why
There's no mirrors on these walls no more
You can't tell me why
Your so terrified of beautiful

[Refrain]
Scared of the good
More than the evil
Scared of the light
More than the dark
Scared of a truth so much more than a lie
I'm scared for me
I'm scared of me
Scared of beautiful

[Verse 2]
Turn the lamp down, don't talk to me
That light bulb, took something from me
Gave something to me
I can't decide, I can't decide
I took freedom, gave purpose
Can't blame him to perfect
All this beauty ever came
It was reason for some beautiful life

[Pre-Chorus]


[Chorus]


[Refrain]

[Bridge]
Mirror mirror on the wall
Who's the fairest of them all
Mirror mirror oh your so
Unfair to all of the beautiful ones oh

[Chorus]


[Refrain]

[Outro}
I'm scared of me
I'm scared of me
I'm scared of me
I'm scared to be beautiful
Beautiful
Beautiful
Beautiful
