[Chorus:]
I gotta get myself together, cuz I got someplace to go
And I'm praying when I get there, I see everyone I know
I wanna go to heaven, I wanna go to heaven
Said I wanna go to heaven, I wanna go to heaven
Do you wanna go?

[Verse 1:]
Can you picture a place where there a smile on every face
And all the worry, all the stress and all the pressure's been erased
Walking down a street that's golden
Angels singing, perfect weather
Everybody's got a mansion, y'all it just don't get no better
I wanna go

[Chorus]

[Verse 2:]
The only way I can explain it
Is that in life we go through changes
Though we know it serves a purpose
Still sometimes it just seems worthless
But this race that I am running
Whether I run it fast or slow
Long as I just keep on running
I'm gonna make it there someday
I know

[Chorus]

There's a place for us (one day I wanna see it)
There's a place for us (and you may not believe it)
But I'm just living my life so I can live again
Everyday I'm getting ready 'cause I wanna make it in
Ooh, heaven!

I gotta get myself together, cuz I got someplace to go
And I'm praying when I get there, I see everyone I know
I wanna go to heaven, I wanna go to heaven

Ooh, it gets hard sometimes
Sometimes I lose my way
But Lord knows I'm trying
To get to Heaven someday
To that beautiful city
Said, "I wanna go to Heaven"

I wanna go to Heaven
I wanna go to Heaven
I wanna go to Heaven
I wanna go
