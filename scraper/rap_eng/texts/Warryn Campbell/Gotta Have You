[Chorus]
I gotta have You
I gotta have You
I gotta have You
I gotta have You
Oh Lord, I gotta have You
I gotta have You
I gotta have You
I gotta have You
I gotta have You
Oh Lord, I gotta have You

[Verse]
See You make me as happy as I can be
Your love is a guarantee in a world of changes
You and I, together stay on my mind
You are the truth and the life
There's no other way

[Chorus]
I gotta have You
I gotta have You
I gotta have You
I gotta have You
Oh Lord, I gotta have You
I gotta have You
I gotta have You
I gotta have You
I gotta have You
Oh Lord, I gotta have You

[Verse 2]
Look at how You turned my world inside out
I'm lovin' what You're about
You won my faith 'cause
I'm so in, You picked my life up again
And still became my best friend
Now everyday

[Chorus]
I gotta have You
I gotta have You
I gotta have You
I gotta have You
Oh Lord, I gotta have You
I gotta have You
I gotta have You
I gotta have You
I gotta have You
Oh Lord, I gotta have You

[Bridge]
If You take Your love away from me
I don't know what I would do
Oh no, no, no
See there's a giant hole in my heart
That can only be filled by You
Only You

[Chorus]
I gotta have You
I gotta have You
I gotta have You
I gotta have You
Oh Lord, I gotta have You
I gotta have You
I gotta have You
I gotta have You
I gotta have You
Oh Lord, I gotta have You
I gotta have You
I gotta have You
I gotta have You
I gotta have You
Oh Lord, I gotta have You
I gotta have You
I gotta have You
I gotta have You
I gotta have You
Oh Lord, I gotta have You
