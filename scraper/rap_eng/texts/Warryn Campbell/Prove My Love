[Verse 1]
My feelings shift from one moment to the next
Right now I hate you, next minute all I want is your sex
Ooh, if you only knew how I much I need you
You wouldn't do what you do, you're being so cruel

[Chorus]
What do I have to prove?
What mountain must I move?
Must I swim the ocean blue?
Don't wanna be without you
What do I have to prove?
Let me be the one you choose
Must I tear the sky in two
Just to prove my love to you?

[Verse 2]
You embarrassed me
You didn't cherish me
Made me question just who you are
You made me question myself and how I let it get this far
I want you, I want you, I want you
But I can't stand you
I need you, I need you, I need you
But I don't believe you
What is the madness
This madness they call love
Ohh, it's sick
I feel so sick

[Chorus]
What do I have to prove?
What mountain must I move?
Must I swim the ocean blue?
Don't wanna be without you
What do I have to prove?
Let me be the one you choose
Must I tear the sky in two
Just to prove my love to you?

[Bridge]
Mulling it over, I guess you think you have the time
Better be hoping that I don't go and change my mind
Been to the bottom and I won't go back there again
We all have a limit and you pushed mine as far as you can
Mulling it over, I guess you think you have the time
Better be hoping that I don't go and change my mind
Been to the bottom and I won't go back there again
We all have a limit and you pushed mine as far as you can
What if I told you I was tired of hearing her name
I know you once loved her, now it's over she's out of the game
When will you see I'm something different, respect what you found
I'm not the kind of woman you leave hanging around
