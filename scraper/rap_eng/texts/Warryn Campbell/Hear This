[Intro]
Is it ok if I talk to you a little
I've been in a situation where I felt like
The Lord didn't hear my cry
I made the same mistakes over and over
And I just wanted the Lord to hear me
And forgive me for the things that I have done
And I know that you've probably dealt with the same thing
I wanna encourage you
Know that He'll heal you


[Verse 1]
I know I've said to you over and over
I'm going to get it together sooner or later
You told me to let some things go and I said, "I'll do better"
And you even said if you do this I'll do that
And I told you I was moving on and I was right back
In my situation which led me to complications
Oooh I know, I know

[Chorus]
I know. I know. I made a promise
And it may have seemed like jibberish
Please hear this
Lord, I'm relentless
Hear this
Hear this
Hear this
Oh, hear this
Hear this
Lord, I'm relentless

[Verse 2]
I've even said, "Please, never leave me!"
And I meant that seriously, Lord, accept my plea, yeah
Lord, I'm crying out to you
Because without you I don't know what I would do
And I know

[Chorus]
I know. I know. I made a promise
And it may have seemed like jibberish
Please hear this
Lord, I'm relentless
Hear this
Hear this
Hear this
Oh, hear this
Hear this
Lord, I'm relentless

[Bridge]
Lord, I'm sorry for
For the things that I've done
For the disappointments
And for my disobedience
Ooh I'm sorry Lord
Oh Lord
Please hear me
Never leave me
Cause I made mistakes
And I know that You're the only way
And I know

[Chorus]
I know. I know. I made a promise
And it may have seemed like jibberish
Please hear this
Lord, I'm relentless
Hear this
Hear this
Hear this
Oh, hear this
Hear this
Lord, I'm relentless
