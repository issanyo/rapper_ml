[Chorus]
Thank you for all the tears, all the stress
You're the best
I feel blessed
I'm a better woman now
Look how I smile
All you did was help the next man
Cause this experience made me who I am

[Verse 1]
I tried to make me love ya
I tried to make me stay
But every time I tried, myself and I got in the way
And just for the sake of my daughter
I tried to stick to the plan
But I had to get rid of the weight on my fourth finger, left hand
To everybody listenin'
Sorry if you're disappointed
You see the life I chose was only what I thought I wanted
Nothing's picture perfect
Looks can be deceivin'
But what I thought was love
Was something I could not believe in

[Chorus]
Thank you for all the tears, all the stress
You're the best
I feel blessed
I'm a better woman now
Look how I smile
All you did was help the next man
Cause this experience made me who I am

[Verse 2]
I always had the feelin'
That baby boy was cheatin'
I kept tellin' myself, "If you ain't happy Bran, just leave him."
I wasn't raised to quit
Cause quitters never win
But what do you gain
If you feel incomplete within
I'm sick of all the questions
All the what's and why's
"What happened? Why'd y'all break up?
Why we never see you cry?"
But do you know how it feels
To hurt behind closed doors
And when you go outside
You're wonderin' what you're smilin' for

[Chorus]
Thank you for all the tears, all the stress
You're the best
I feel blessed
I'm a better woman now
Look how I smile
All you did was help the next man
Cause this experience made me who I am

[Bridge]
Now that it's over I can live
Now all you have belongs to me
My heart is open like a book
And everything he eats I cook
What I'm to him, he is to me
We are each other's everything
But if I wouldn't stay with you
I wouldn't have it like I do

[Chorus]
Thank you for all the tears, all the stress
You're the best
I feel blessed
I'm a better woman now
Look how I smile
All you did was help the next man
Cause this experience made me who I am

[Outro]
Thank you for all the tears, all the stress
You're the best
I feel blessed
I'm a better woman now
Look how I smile
All you did was help the next man
Cause this experience made me who I am
