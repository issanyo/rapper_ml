[Verse 1]
Breaking up, heartache
Just waking up
Gotta be the hardest thing
To give everything and still lose
It's such a waste of love

I thought it was (I thought it was) but it wasn't
But now I know (I know it's not) what I wanted
No matter how, I tried to make it work
Things only got worse
People try to tell you just be patient
And maybe things will be better

[Chorus]
But sometimes things just fall apart
No one wants to be alone
But sometimes it's just time to walk away

[Verse 2]
Oh, who is to blame, who takes the fall
Cause either way, it's no one's fault
No you can't help, what's truly in your heart
It's who you are (be true to who you are)

I thought that we were so (close, how did we) get so far
It's only now, it's all (over, I see) what went wrong
I guess this is what it means when something ain't meant to be
We should just let it go
And I know you still wanna hold on
Cause you can't believe that your love ain't enough

[Chorus]
But sometimes things just fall apart
No one wants to be alone
But sometimes it's just time to walk away

[Bridge]
It's the worst thing in life
But I believe that in the end (you'll be alright)
Cause it doesn't work no more
It only hurts (even more)
Ain't nothing 'bout it you can do
So you got to move on cause

[Chorus]
Sometimes things just fall apart
No one wants to be alone
But sometimes it's just time to walk away
Just might not be right for you

Sometimes things just fall apart
No one wants to be alone
Sometimes it's just time to walk away
Might go find who's right for you

Sometimes things just fall apart
And no one wants to be alone
Sometimes it's just time to walk away
