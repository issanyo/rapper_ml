[Verse 1]
People dream for money
People dream for fame
We both dreaming baby
But we don't dream the same
See I've got a purpose
It's more than a plan
Crossing troubled waters
Any way I can

[Pre-Chorus]
At times I had my doubts
Some days I didn't know
My mind is better now
My faith on overload
What you living for?
What you living for?
What you living for?
What you living for?

[Chorus]
They say, You're nothing so
Just throw it all away
You know, The enemy
Has nothing good to say
Let's be iconic
Let's defeat the odds today
Until they know our name
Until they know our name!
'Cause we are, we are the warriors tonight
We are, we are the warriors!
Don't let, don't let 'em take away your fight
We are, we are
The warriors

[Verse 2]
This is freedom baby
We can't run away
We won't be retreatin'
'Cause we're here to stay, yeah
They want us divided
But look at us as one
We're the revolution
And we've just begun

[Pre-Chorus]
At times I had my doubts
Some days I didn't know
My mind is better now
My faith on overload
What you living for?
What you living for?
What you living for?
What you living for?

[Chorus]
They say, You're nothing so
Just throw it all away
You know, The enemy
Has nothing good to say
Let's be iconic
Let's defeat the odds today
Until they know our name
Until they know our name!
'Cause we are, we are the warriors tonight
We are, we are the warriors!
Don't let, don't let 'em take away your fight
We are, we are
The warriors

[Bridge]
Live for solutions
Live for the truth
Live for the man down
'Cause He died for you
New generation
Fighting for the youth
You gotta fight for the future
Fight for you

[Chorus]
They say, You're nothing so
Just throw it all away
You know, The enemy
Has nothing good to say
Let's be iconic
Let's defeat the odds today
Until they know our name
Until they know our name!
'Cause we are, we are the warriors tonight
We are, we are the warriors!
Don't let, don't let 'em take away your fight
We are, we are
The warriors

[Outro]
Warriors, we are, we are
We are warriors (I'm a warrior tonight)
Warriors, we are, we are
We are victorious
Warriors, we are, we are
We are warriors
