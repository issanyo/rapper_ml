[Verse 1]
Now, I'm craving your body, is this real
Temperature's rising, I don't want to feel
I'm in the wrong place to be real
And I'm longing to love you just for a night
Kissing and hugging and holding you tight
Please let me love you
With all my might

[Chorus]
Reasons, the reasons that we're here
The reasons that we fear
Our feelings won't disappear

[Post-Chorus]
And after the love game has been played
All our illusions were just a parade
And all the reasons start to fade

La, la la la, la, la la la
La, la la la, la, la la la
La, la la la, la, la la la
La, la la la, la, la la la

[Bridge]
After all our reasons why
All the reasons were a lie
After all the reasons love
Love was left aside

[Verse 2]
And, longing to love you for one night
Please let me love you with all of my might, baby
Ooh baby

[Chorus]
The reasons, the reasons that we're here
The reasons that we fear
Our feelings won't disappear

[Post-Chorus]
And after the love games have been played
All our illusions were just a parade
And all our reasons start to fade

[Verse 3]
And, in the morning when I rise
No longer feeling hypnotized
For no reason, our reason, our reasons
Have no pride

[Bridge]
After all the reasons why
All of the reasons were a lie
After all the reasons love
All this love was left aside

[Outro]
Love was left aside, yeah
And I can't, I can't, I can't, I can't find
Can't find the reasons
Why our love won't disappear
Can't find the reasons
Why I love you, my baby, my dear
Can't find the reasons
Wanna love you all night
Can't find the reasons
Gotta squeeze ya, real tight
'Cause it's all about love
