[Intro]
I am God
I am God

[Verse 1: Erica]
Thinking to yourself that you're by yourself
Yet and still you're talking loud
But just tell me who you talking to if you don't believe I'm around
Said I'll never leave, so you're never alone
Even when you feel you are
I'm right here holding your hand
But still, you think I'm way too far

[Hook]
What do I gotta do to make you understand that
I want what's best for you and I always have?
But maybe you're confused about who I really am
Stand still and know I'm God

[Verse 2: Tina]
You look at your life and you wonder
Why your situation never changes
You blame it on them
You blame it on Me
Maybe it's you thinking the wrong way
You should close your eyes open them again
Maybe you'll see that I gave you life
And another chance to give me a chance
To take your wrong and make it right

[Hook]
What do I gotta do to make you understand that
I want what's best for you and I always have?
But maybe you're confused about who I really am
Stand still and know I'm God

[Bridge]
Maybe you are only listening (to what you wanna hear)
If you follow My direction
(Everything would be so clear)
I'm the answer, the solution
(To every question that you ask)
Only way you made it this far
(Is because I carried you here so)

[Hook]
What do I gotta do to make you understand that
I want what's best for you and I always have?
But maybe you're confused about who I really am
Stand still and know I'm God

What do I gotta do to make you understand that
I want what's best for you and I always have?
But maybe you're confused about who I really am
Stand still and know I'm God

What do I gotta do to make you understand that
I want what's best for you and I always have?
But maybe you're confused about who I really am
Stand still and know I'm God
