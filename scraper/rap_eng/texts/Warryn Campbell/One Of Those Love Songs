Verse 1 - Kandi (Xscape)
When you're far from me there's a melody
That always brings me closer to you
It's our own symphony, just for you and me
And I hope they play it real soon
(Every time I wish that
We were dancing slow)
That's when I hear it playing
On the radio, I know

Chorus
This is one of those love songs
That you hear in the middle of the night
Makes me wanna be with you
Where ever you are tonight
And who ever's listenin'
Just hold your lovers tight
'Cos this is one of those love songs
One of those love songs

Verse 2 - LaTocha (Xscape)
As days turn into years
We've had our share of tears
But they never seem to last long
'Cos the sadness disappears
Every time I hear our favorite love song
(Now the candles burn
As I lay here in my bed)
As the melody keeps playin'
Over and over in my head

Chorus (with LaTocha adlibs)
This is one of those love songs
That you hear in the middle of the night
Makes me wanna be with you
Where ever you are tonight
And who ever's listenin'
Just hold your lover tight
This is one of those love songs, yeah

Bridge - Tiny
That you never want to end, no, oh on
And you hope that the DJ plays it again, and again
And again, play it again and again, and again

Chorus (with LaTocha and Tiny adlibs)
This is one of those love songs
That you hear in the middle of the night
Makes me wanna be with you
Where ever you are tonight
And who ever's listenin'
Just hold your lover tight
This is one of those love songs
One of those love songs
This is one of those love songs
That you hear in the middle of the night
Makes me wanna be with you
Where ever you are tonight
And who ever's listenin'
Just hold your lover tight
This is one of those love songs
One of those love songs
