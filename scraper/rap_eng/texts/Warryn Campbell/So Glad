[Chorus:]
So glad to be here
Breathing walking talking Yeah
Living loving you Yeah
Is all I wanna do
Gotta lift my hands everytime I get a chance
Gotta let you know
I love living this life with you

[Verse 1:]
Wonder why I smile
Why I'm so happy now
Cause it wasn't always like this Yeah, took me a while
To figure out you that you were all that I need
And nothing has been better than the love you show me

[Chorus]

[Verse 2:]
It could have been me
Sleeping on the street
With no food to eat
But I thank God that ain't my story
So I won't complain
I won't sing no sad songs
Cause everything ain't right
But everything ain't wrong

[Chorus]

[Bridge:]
You've been so good to me
Better than anyone could be
And I'm just living living for the love of you
All I need you are
Only you brought me this far
And I can't imagine life without you

[Chorus x12]
