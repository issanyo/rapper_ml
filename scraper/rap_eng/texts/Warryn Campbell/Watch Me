Uh huh uh you tried ta sneak by me now did ya?
Uh huh uh now gimme what you promised me

[Verse 1:]
Something bout the sexy music
Love the way it feels, yeah
Lookin at you I can't help it
Make me want you to reveal
What's under your clothes
I just wonder what's under your clothes
Makes me wonder when you...

[Chorus:]
Move it
I like the way you move it
Don't stop now, baby do it
So sexy
You can't take your eyes off me, huh?
You're liking what you see, huh?
Well, come on, baby, watch me
Watch me, watch me, watch me, oh

[Verse 2:]
I think I wanna do ya oh
You got me open
And if you keep on moving like this
I'mma lose control
Think I better leave you alone
'Cause you make me wonder
What's under your clothes
You make make me wonder when you

[Chorus] (2x)

[Bridge:]
You got my attention
Nobody else matters
You like the way I twist it
Dip it, lift it, roll it, twerk it, don't ya?
I can tell you want me
'Cause you keep on staring
At the way I twist it
Dip it, lift it, roll it, twerp it, move it

[Chorus] (3x)
