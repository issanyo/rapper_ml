[Verse 1]
Friends we've been for so long
Now true colors are showing
Makes me wanna cry (oh yes, it does)
'Cause I had to say goodbye

[Chorus]
By now I should know
That, in time, things must change
So it shouldn't be so bad
So why do I feel so sad?

[Verse 2]
How can I adjust
To the way that things are going?
It's killing me slowly
I just want it to be how it used to be
'Cause I wish that I could stay
But, in time, things must change
So it shouldn't be so bad
So why do I feel so sad?

[Bridge]
You cannot hide
The way you feel inside
I realize
Your actions speak much louder than words
So tell me why, oh

[Chorus]
By now, I should know that--
That, in time, things must change
So it shouldn't be, it shouldn't be so bad
So why do I feel so sad?

By now, I should know
That, in time, things must change
So it shouldn't be so bad
So why do I feel so sad?

By now, by now, I should know
That in time things must grow
And I had to leave you behind
So why do I feel so sad
If it couldn't be that bad?
Tell me why

By now, I should know
That in time things must change
So it shouldn't be so bad
So why do I feel so sad?

[Outro]
Why do I feel so sad?
Why do I feel so sad?

When I know that it must change
It must change, I don't mind
Just be real with me, just be truthful
And the rest, I'm leaving up to this one

Why does it feel so bad inside
When I realize that you gotta be left behind? (feel so sad)
