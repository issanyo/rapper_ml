When I was younger girl
Nobody told me 'bout the facts of life
I was living in the clouds
I didn't think about what's wrong or right

So I didn't understand
That playing games is what some people do
I swore I didn't start my life
Until the day I fell in love with you

And you kept takin' me higher
Just to drop me off

Do you feel like a man?
'Cause you've got my heart in your hands
And you took me high as you can
Higher just to drop me off

Tell me did it make you feel good
Treatin' me the way that you would?
'Cause you took me high as you could
Higher just to drop me off

When I was a younger girl
Nobody told me I would have to fight
To keep my sanity
I couldn't love because I'd lose my sight

So I did everythin' you did
And said I'd never give you back my heart
Until you came around the game
And I was right back at the very start

And you kept takin' me higher
Just to drop me off

Do you feel like a man?
'Cause you've got my heart in your hands
And you took me high as you can
Higher just to drop me off

Tell me did it make you feel good
Treatin' me the way that you would?
'Cause you took me high as you could
Higher just to drop me off
Higher just to drop me

Does it make you feel good
To know you broke me? That's what people say
Does it make you feel good?
You know you broke me down

I give you all I have till there's nothin' left
And all the time I spent, I can't get that back
So I think of what to do, what I wish I knew
How to keep away from you, hey, hey, hey

So do you feel like a man?
'Cause you've got my heart in your hands
And you took me high as you can
Higher just to drop me off

Higher, higher, higher
You take me higher just to drop me off

Tell me did it make you feel good
Treatin' me the way that you would?
'Cause you took me high as you could
Higher just to drop me off
