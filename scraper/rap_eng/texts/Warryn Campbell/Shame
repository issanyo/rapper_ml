[Verse 1]
I need your forgiveness and your mercy too
I must be all kind of crazy what I’ve done to you
I hope  you understand that my heart is true
Mistakes I’ve made, but I’m making change for you
Have I learned is your question, and my answer I have
If you’re expecting perfection, then we’re not gon’ last
This is not an excuse, I’m just telling the truth
Baby I’m so sorry for hurting you

[Chorus]
Oh, I’m ashamed of me, (shame on me)
Wish I never done you wrong, (shame on me)
Every night of us I dream that I wake up in your arms (Oooh ooh oooo)

[Verse 2]
I know why you left me, but since you’ve been gone
My understanding has more than grown
I come to this conclusion over and over again
I don’t want an enemy, I just want back my friend

[Chorus]
Oh, I’m ashamed of me, (shame on me)
I Wish I never done you wrong, (shame on me)
Every night of us I dream that I wake up in your arms

[Verse 3]
Yeah
Wish I could say sorry, oh and you come back home hey babe, yeah
I wish diamonds could do it, so I wouldn't have to be alone, yeah
If I knew then what I know now, everything would be fine
Yeah, yeah, hey

[Chorus]
Oh, I’m ashamed of me, (shame on me)
Wish I never done you wrong, (shame on me)
Every night of us I dream that I wake up in your arms (Arms)

[Outro]
I’m ashamed of me, (shame)
I’m ashamed of all the lies I told, (shame)
Wish I come home, wish I come home at night, (shame)
Girl I wish I never creeped, [?] (shame)
Said I’m ashamed, baby I thought there was something better out there then me, there (shame)
Come on baby, what am I supposed to tell these kids? Babe
Baby I’m ashamed
I’m so sorry babe, I’m so sorry
