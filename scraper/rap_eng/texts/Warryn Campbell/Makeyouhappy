Oh
Hey, girl. Help me know
What is it that really does it for you?
Is it about the things that money buys
Or a man that loves you?
Cuz I'm just lookin at how good you look
And right away I wanna
So how do you want it?

Cuz I can do it fast or slow
Either at the crib or at the (?)mall(?)
Now I can keep you up all night
Or we could make it quick but do it just right

So girl, come with me
We can have a good time
Take a load off ya mind
Girl, dance with me
Baby, you never know
You and I could be something, girl
I can be anything that you want
I could f**k it or love it
So what's it gonna be?
Bet I could make you happy

Now I don't know what you
Expect from a man these days
But girl, I just know that
Whatever it is I got you
Listen, baby 
You won't ever have to wonder
Any time you want it, here's my number
Call me up when you need someone to play with
Or be serious with you

Cuz we could f**k around(?)
And give it to you and turn you out
Or I could just come and hold you
And be the perfect gentleman
Whatever you want

Girl, come with me
We can have a good time
Take a load off ya mind
Girl, dance with me
Baby, you never know
You and I could be something, girl
I can be anything that you want
I could f**k it or love it
So what's it gonna be?
Bet I could make you happy

If you tell me what you like
I can give it to you right
Either way it's hard to say to me
Just don't be playin no games with me
I only got one night in town, baby
So I suggest you let me know if you down. baby
Tell your girlfriends that you gon see them later
Tell your boyfriends don't be a hater

Girl, come with me
We can have a good time
Take a load off ya mind
Girl, dance with me

You and I could be something, girl
I can be anything that you want
I could f**k it or love it
So what's it gonna be?
Bet I could make you happy

So what's it gonna be?
Bet I could make you happy
