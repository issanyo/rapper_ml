[Intro]
I'm gonna lose my mind
I'm gonna lose my mind
I'm gonna lose my mind
Gonna lose my mind

[Verse 1]
In the corners of mind
I just can't seem to find a reason to believe
That I can break fee
Cause you see I have been down for so long
Feel like the hope is gone
But as I lift my hands, I understand
That I should praise you through my circumstance

[Chorus]
Take the shackles off my feet so I can dance
I just wanna praise you
I just wanna praise you
You broke the chains, now I can lift my hands
And I'm gonna praise you
And I'm gonna praise you

[Verse 2]
Everything that could go wrong
All went wrong at one time
So much pressure fell on me
I thought I was gonna lose my mind
But you know you wanna see
If I will hold on through these trials
But I need you to lift this load
Cause I can´t take It anymore

[Chorus]
Take the shackles off my feet so I can dance
I just wanna praise you
I just wanna praise you
You broke the chains, now I can lift my hands
And I´m gonna praise you
And I´m gonna praise you
(Praise you)
(Praise you)
(Praise you)

[Bridge]
I'm gonna lose my mind
I'm gonna lose my mind
I'm gonna lose my mind
Gonna loose my mind
I'm gonna lose my mind
I'm gonna lose my mind
I'm gonna lose my mind
Gonna loose my mind
(Praise you)
(Praise you)
(Praise you)

[Chorus]
Take the shackles off my feet so I can dance
I just wanna praise you
I just wanna praise you
You broke the chains, now I can lift my hands
And I´m gonna praise you
And I´m gonna praise you
