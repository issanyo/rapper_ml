You
I just wanna walk and talk with You
Every minute of my time with You
All I wanna be about is You
'Cause I can't live without You
Wherever I go I wanna see You
No matter who is watchin' me You
Everyday that I wake up You
'Cause I can't get enough of You
Lot of people callin' me
Tryin' to get my attention
Do some things I ain't suppose to
Lead me in the wrong direction
But the only road for me
Is to where ever You are
I will follow You wherever
No matter how near or far
You
I just wanna walk and talk with You
Every minute of my time with You
All I wanna be about is You
'Cause I can't live without You
Wherever I go I wanna see You
No matter who is watchin' me You
Everyday that I wake up You
'Cause I can't get enough of You
Same old movie, same show
And I don't wanna see it
Same old song on the radio
And I don't wanna hear it
Same old people goin' left
And I wanna be right
I'm leavin' them for good now
What I need in my life is
You
I just wanna walk and talk with You
Every minute of my time with You
All I wanna be about is You
'Cause I can't live without You
Wherever I go I wanna see You
No matter who is watchin' me You
Everyday that I wake up You
'Cause I can't get enough of You
Oh, You
Oh, You
Oh, oh, oh
You're not the ordinary, You're so far above
I'm sort of a fanatic, it's way more than love
It's more than just a feelin', it's not just a touch
I wish that I could tell You but words ain't enough, uh
You
I just wanna walk and talk with You
Every minute of my time with You
All I wanna be about is You
'Cause I can't live without You
Wherever I go I wanna see You
No matter who is watchin' me You
Everyday that I wake up You
'Cause I can't get enough of You
