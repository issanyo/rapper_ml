[Intro]
Whew
So you say you wanna know
How I really feel

[Chorus]
Well, baby look into my eyes (will)
My eyes (tell you), my eyes (what I), my eyes (feel)
No matter (No matter what I say)
I don't care (care)
You'll always know the truth by looking into my eyes

[Verse 1]
They say they're the windows to the soul
Tells it all and everybody knows
That the older you get, the wiser you grow
I suppose I been through the most
But I smile in spite of the pain
My eyes get red sometimes from all the cryin'
But if you stay, boy, each day I live
From the depths of my soul, I promise to give

[Chorus]
My heart (will), my heart (tell you)
My heart (what I), my heart (feel)
No matter (No matter what I say)
I don't care (I don't care)
You always know the truth by listening to my heart

[Verse 2]
Will be for you
Only if you want it to
We go back and forth once in a while
So I shouldn't have to say if you should know how by now
How to act, when I mad at you
You know exactly what to do
Just give me an hour or two
You'll know that I'm over it when I give you

[Chorus]
My kiss, my kiss (will tell you)
My kiss (what I), my kiss (feel)
No matter (No matter, what I say)
I don't care (I don?t care)
You always know exactly what it is by my kiss

[Bridge]
Do you ever wonder where love comes from?
(Where it comes from)
Is it real? Or do you just imagine?
Are we dreamin? Are we really here?
Oh, well?
If there's any fear or doubt in your mind
Let me make this one thing clear
That you're all in my soul
All in my mind
If you don't believe it
Well, baby, look into my

[Chorus]
My eyes, my eyes (they will)
My eyes (tell you), my eyes (what I feel)
No matter (No matter what I say)
I don't care (I don't care)
You'll always know the truth by looking into my heart
My heart (it will), my heart (tell you)
My heart (what I), my heart (what I feel)
No matter (no matter, what I say)
I don't care (I don't care)
You'll always know the truth by listening to my kiss
My kiss (my kiss)
My kiss (it will tell you)
My kiss (what I)
My kiss (what I feel)
No matter (no matter, what I say)
I don?t care (I don?t care)
You?ll always know exactly what it is by
My kiss (it will)
My eyes (my eyes)
My heart (my heart)
My kiss (and my kiss)
My eyes
My heart
My kiss
(Fade out)
