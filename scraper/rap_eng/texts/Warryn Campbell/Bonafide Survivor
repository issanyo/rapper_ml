Uh Uh Uh, Uh Uh
Yeah,yeah,yeah (Aye)
You can try to kick me when I'm down
It ain't gon break me
And you can love me when I'm all tight(?)
It ain't gon make me(hey)
You can say what you wanna
Cause I'm still here
I won't give you the satisfaction to see my tears
Cause ain't a lot of chicks built like the way I'm built
And can't a lot of chicks deal with the shit I live(hey)
So I'm a face another day with a smile on my face
And say :hey I'm a be okay,okay
Yeah,yeah,yeah(aye)
Cause Im a be stronger and wiser
I'm a fighter
Say I'm a bonafide survivor
I'm a bonafide survivor(hey)
Said I'm a be stronger and wiser
I'm a fighter
Say I'm a bonafide survivor
I'm a bonafide survivor(aye)
You can try to take away my drive
But I stay driven
And you could criticize my lifestyle
But I'm still living(hey)
See when your heart is hurting
And your questions don't fade(?)
You didn't ever think
That it was gonna be this way?
Cause everything that could possibly go wrong did
And how come I ain't gettin outta life what I put in
Got to find your inner strength just to face another day
And say hey ,Im a be okay,okay
Yeah,yeah,yeah,(aye)
Cause I'm a be stronger and wiser
I'm a fighter
Say I'm a bonafide survivor
I'm a bonafide survivor(hey)
Said I'm a be stronger and wiser
I'm a fighter
Say I'm a bonafide survivor
I'm a bonafide survivor(aye)
Sometimes it gets so out of hand
And you feel like giving up
Don't give up
Cause one door close it's open another
And if it don't happen
You gon push a little further
We all go through pain
And pain ain't to blame
It's only a sure sign of weakness
Leaving!
Understand,what don't kill you makes you stronger
And you're still breathing
Cause I'm a be stronger and wiser
I'm a fighter
Say I'm a bonafide survivor
I'm a bonafide survivor
Said I'm a be stronger and wiser
I'm a fighter
Say I'm a bonafide survivor
I'm a bonafide survivor
Cause I'm a be stronger and wiser
I'm a fighter
Say I'm a bonafide survivor
I'm a bonafide survivor
Said I'm a be stronger and wiser
I'm a fighter
Say I'm a bonafide survivor
I'm a bonafide survivor(aye)
Yeah,yeah,yeah,yeah
