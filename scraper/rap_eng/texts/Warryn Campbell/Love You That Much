[Hook]
If You tell me to go I'm gonna tell You, "I will"
Cause I love you that much
If You tell me to stay and be still I will
Cause I love You that much
Tell me what to say even if I'm afraid I will
Cause I love You that much
It doesn't matter, whatever, whenever I will
Cause I love You that much

[Verse 1: Tina]
Nowadays everybody wants to be in control
Tryna be the leader when they've never even really followed
Got no information and no direction and way too much pride
When it ain't that hard to just ask the Lord to be your guide

[Hook]
If You tell me to go I'm gonna tell You, "I will"
Cause I love you that much
If You tell me to stay and be still I will
Cause I love You that much
Tell me what to say even if I'm afraid I will
Cause I love You that much
It doesn't matter, whatever, whenever I will
Cause I love You that much

[Verse 2: Erica]
One love and one heart, one God who gives it away
Most folks they don't wanna believe that today
But I'll take Your love and I'll give my love all to You completely
Cause I trust in You and I believe that You know what's best for me

[Hook]
If You tell me to go I'm gonna tell You, "I will"
Cause I love you that much
If You tell me to stay and be still I will
Cause I love You that much
Tell me what to say even if I'm afraid I will
Cause I love You that much
It doesn't matter, whatever, whenever I will
Cause I love You that much

[Bridge]
I will always trust in the fact that
You've got me in the palm of Your hand
Use me how You will
No matter how I feel
Cause there's no way that
I could know You put the sun in the sky
I could know You hung the moon for the night
And still not wanna trust You
Well that wouldn't be right so I'm saying

[Hook]
If You tell me to go I'm gonna tell You, "I will"
Cause I love you that much
If You tell me to stay and be still I will
Cause I love You that much
Tell me what to say even if I'm afraid I will
Cause I love You that much
It doesn't matter, whatever, whenever I will
Cause I love You that much
