[Verse 1: Tina Campbell]
The word of God is power
Sharper than a sword
It knows the thoughts you’re thinking
And what you’re feeling in your heart
It’ll teach you, train you, transform you
If you let it in
It’ll cover you and carry you
Turn you away from sin

If you wanna be like Jesus
And live like he lived
You’ve gotta read the Bible
And do what he did

[Chorus 1: Tina Campbell]
(Speak the word) If you’re tired of being in the situation you’re in
(Speak the word) If you’re sick in your body and you’re ready to be healed
(Speak the word) If the way you’re thinking has really got to change
(Speak the word) ‘Cause the power of life and death is in what you say
The word of God is your weapon, use it to fight and win
Speak the word
You’ve gotta speak the word, oh, yeah

[Verse 2: Teddy Campbell]
The word of God is power
Sharper than a sword
It knows the thoughts you’re thinking
And what you’re feeling in your heart
It’ll teach you, train you, transform you
If you let it in
It’ll cover you and carry you
Turn you away from sin

If you wanna be like Jesus
And live like he lived
You’ve gotta read the Bible
And do what he did

[Chorus 2: Teddy Campbell]
(Speak the word) To remind yourself God gave you authority
(Speak the word) To renew your mind and keep the devil under your feet
(Speak the word) To leave the past behind and be who God called you to be
(Speak the word) ‘Cause it’s alive and it revives everything
The word of God is the truth and the light
And it’ll make you free
Speak the word, you gotta speak the word

[Chorus 2: Tina Campbell]
(Speak the word) To remind yourself God gave you authority
(Speak the word) To renew your mind and keep the devil under your feet
(Speak the word) To leave the past behind and be who God called you to be
(Speak the word) ‘Cause it’s alive and it revives everything
The word of God is the truth and the light
And it’ll make you free
Speak the word, you gotta speak the word

[Bridge: Tina Campbell]
(Speak the word) Jesus loves you, and he saves
(Speak the word) When you’re in Christ, you’re never the same

[Bridge: Teddy Campbell]
(Speak the word) Let him change your nature, let him make it right
(Speak the word) As you draw closer, he’ll change your life

[Bridge: Tina Campbell]
(Speak the word) Don’t settle for less, you can have it all
(Speak the word) Just get in that book, and let Jesus talk

[Bridge: Teddy Campbell]
(Speak the word) Let the word fill you, let the word heal you
(Speak the word) Let the word save you, let the word change you

[Bridge: Tina Campbell]
(Speak the word) ‘Cause Jesus died for you and me

[Bridge: Teddy Campbell]
(Speak the word) Got up out of the grave with all authority

[Bridge: Tina Campbell]
(Speak the word) He gives you power when you invite him in

[Bridge: Teddy Campbell]
(Speak the word) He’ll be your help, your closest friend

[Bridge: Tina Campbell]
(Speak the word) Through Jesus Christ, you can do all things
(Speak the word) You can live your life abundantly

[Bridge: Teddy Campbell]
(Speak the word) He gives you hope and a future
(Speak the word) He makes you more than a conqueror

[Bridge: Tina Campbell]
(Speak the word) You’ve been redeemed, you are brand new
(Speak the word) His word is perfecting everything about you

[Bridge: Teddy Campbell]
(Speak the word) So stomp on the devil, crush him under your feet
(Speak the word) You are an overcomer, you’ve got the victory

[Bridge: Tina Campbell]
You will not know (Speak the word) unless you read (Speak the word)
You will not have (Speak the word) unless you speak (Speak the word)
So speak it (Speak the word)
Believe it (Speak the word)
Receive it (Speak the word)
Oh, speak it (Speak the word)
Oh, speak it (Speak the word)
Oh, speak it (Speak the word)
Oh, speak it (Speak the word)
Oh, speak it (Speak the word)
Oh, speak it (Speak the word)
