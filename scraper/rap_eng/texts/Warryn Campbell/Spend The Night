[Chorus]
All I wanna do is spend the night with you
Spend the night for the rest of my life...
All I wanna do is spend the night with you
Spend the night for the rest of my life...

[Verse 1]
Diamonds may be forever
But they'll never outshine our love
You hold my world, together
Make me forget how life was before you, that's why...

[Chorus]
All I wanna do is spend the night with you
Spend the night for the rest of my life...
All I wanna do is spend the night with you
Spend the night for the rest of my life...

[Verse 2]
I see you, even when I close my eyes
That lets me know you care
Ain't going nowhere
Right height, right size, that frame, you're just my type
And just in case you didn't hear what I said
Come on over here and let me say it in your ear...

[Chorus]
All I wanna do is spend the night with you
Spend the night for the rest of my life...
All I wanna do is spend the night with you
Spend the night for the rest of my life...

[Bridge]
Oooo, say what you wanna, like Vickie Secrets I'm up on ya
Oh, call me crazy, can't let you get away, no
Girl, you give me that good good lovin'
That Harlem Nights "Sunshine"
Can't think about nothing else
If it ain't you I'd rather be by myself...

[Chorus]
All I wanna do is spend the night with you
Spend the night for the rest of my life...
All I wanna do is spend the night with you
Spend the night for the rest of my life...

I see me kissing you goodnight
As you holding onto me so tight
What could be better than that?
Nothing...
I swear girl nothing else feels right
You keep this up then I just might
Keep you for the rest of my life...

[Chorus]
All I wanna do is spend the night with you
Spend the night for the rest of my life...
Nothing I'd rather do, then do my life with you
All I wanna do is spend the night with you
Spend the night for the rest of my life...
All I wanna do is spend the night with you
Spend the night for the rest of my life...
