[Intro]
Oh yeah
Oh yeah

[Verse 1]
They say anything that is worth it you must take it slow
They know when you come around ain't no choice but to grow
Listen for what you say when I lay down my head
I don't know no other way but to let you have your way

[Pre-Chorus]
And no it don't always feel good
But yet, it all works for my good
You say I can take the burn blazing deep inside

[Chorus]
It's feels just like fire, fire caught up in my bones
Don't leave me alone, don't leave me alone
Oh my, my little light
I need to feel that heat come from your
Fire, fire caught up in my bones
Don't leave me alone, don't leave me alone
Just shine like stars in the night
We need to feel that heat come from your fire

[Verse 2]
Just like them boys Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego
I know when I come out the flames won't be smelling like smoke
Yup, that's just what you said, it went straight to my head
Remembering every day to let you have your way

[Pre-Chorus]
And no it don't always feel good
But yet, it all works for my good
You say I can take the burn blazing deep inside

[Chorus]
It's feels just like fire, fire caught up in my bones
Don't leave me alone, don't leave me alone
Oh my, my little light
I need to feel that heat come from your
Fire, fire caught up in my bones
Don't leave me alone, don't leave me alone
Just shine like stars in the night
We need to feel that heat come from your fire

[Bridge]
When your work is done, I'll be here shining bright
The pressure upon me, like diamonds in the sky
Turn into fire, I want to feel your fire
All over it fills me, Jesus you purify me

[Chorus x 3]
It's feels just like fire, fire caught up in my bones
Don't leave me alone, don't leave me alone
Oh my, my little light
I need to feel that heat come from your
Fire, fire caught up in my bones
Don't leave me alone, don't leave me alone
Just shine like stars in the night
We need to feel that heat come from your fire
