That's right, he in the building

[Verse 1]
Ooo, I got a one didn't take long to spot 'em
In the clubs, showing love in them candy apple bottoms
Like ooo, what flavor you tryna pick?
It don't matter if you slim, shawty thick in the hips
I like 'em ooo and you can tell when she walks
She got the good ooo girl, let me break you off
I got that ooo baby, you can tell by the wrist
You ain't never gonna ooo like this

[Pre-Chorus]
You gonna be mine tonight
I got that ooo and it's parked outside
Pouring some ooo in your cup
Blowing that ooo in the air
Ooo, let me take you there

[Chorus]
'Cause when they hit you like ooo
Like you got your first freak
Backseat of the jeep on a late night creep
Like ooo
First time in the club, when you getting some love
Shawty backing it up like ooo
It's like rolling one up
Real girls getting down and we throwing it up
It's like getting your girl in the VIP
Or first time with a fake ID
And it hit you like ooo
