[Verse 1: Baby Dubb]
It was once upon a time not long ago
Lived a little black boy in the middle of the ghetto
Pretty good kid but he always found trouble
Inner city life, it ain't hard to find trouble
No income in the home, you find struggle
Two years struggling it's no puzzle
He hit the block hard and found him a hustle
Burned the wrong bridge and now he needs muscle
He tried to let it go but the streets don't forgive
I guess they ain't heard of live and let live
But after going round and round he broke it down finally found out
That only God can save him now

[Hook: Mary Mary]
Save me now, please save me now
Save me now, please save me now
I'm on my knees, down on the floor
You're the one I need, oh Lord
Just save me now

[Verse 2]
I heard the story many times before (still I'm wondering)
How in the world did I get here (and what am I doing)
Took the ring and acted like I do (without the ceremony)
Now I got three little ones now (hurting and I'm lonely)
Threw away my dreams when I left school (now I'm 22)
Never should've chose him over You

[Hook]
Save me now, please save me now
Save me now, please save me now
I'm on my knees, down on the floor
You're the one I need, oh Lord
Just save me now

[Bridge]
Take me away I don't wanna stay here
I wanna go back to the beginning
To that place where love is forever
Me and You together
Lord will you please

[Hook 2]
Save me now, please save me now
Save me now, please save me now
I'm on my knees down on the floor
You're the one I need, oh Lord
Just save me now
Please save me now
Save me now, please save me now
I love You, Lord
I need You, Lord
I'm begging of You, Lord
Please save me

[Outro]
Save me
Save me
Save me
