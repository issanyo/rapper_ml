[Verse 1]
If the winter springs or the summer falls
It won't have no effect on this love at all
If in another time I was you and you was I
You know I'd still recognize you all the same
This kinda love don't ever change cause

[Hook]
I'll be lovin' you till' the sun starts shinin' blue
And the seas talk back to you
Girl I'll still be there, be there
Lovin' you until all of time is standin' still
Nothin's ever been as real to me as this love
This love, this love
Lovin' you until 2073
We'll still be together in 2084
In love more than ever in 2093
This love just won't ever end
2000 until 2000 until 2000
Until 2000 and forever

[Verse 2]
Yeah, now if dreams could dream  just like people do
I believe they'd dream the dream
Of the love between me and you
And even though we'll fight
And may not get along sometimes
It's cool cause I know that if I fight with you
Cry with you, I can make it up all night with you, so

[Hook]
I'll be lovin' you till' the sun starts shinin' blue
And the seas talk back to you
Girl I'll still be there, be there
Lovin' you until all of time is standin' still
Nothin's ever been as real to me as this love
This love, this love
Lovin' you until 2073
We'll still be together in 2084
In love more than ever in 2093
This love just won't ever end
2000 until 2000 until 2000
Until 2000 and forever

[Bridge]
And forever, if love ever fades away
We'll still find some to make cause time
Don't apply to you and I
Cause this love goes as far as eternity
Way beyond infinity and long after we're dead
And gone we'll still be holdin' on cause

[Hook]
I'll be lovin' you till' the sun starts shinin' blue
And the seas talk back to you
Girl I'll still be there, be there
Lovin' you until all of time is standin' still
Nothin's ever been as real to me as this love
This love, this love
Lovin' you until 2073
We'll still be together in 2084
In love more than ever in 2093
This love just won't ever end
2000 until 2000 until 2000
Until 2000 and forever
