It will all be worth it, it will all be worth it
For those who do believe that one day
He will crack the sky, I know you can't see it now
But one day I know you will

We see through a glass, but hardly
A glimpse of future glory, but darkly
Oh, what a day imagining what awaits

Amidst all of the criticism
Skeptic views and cynicism
Yet we pray just to see Your face

It will all be worth it, it will all be worth it
For those who do believe that one day
He will crack the sky, I know you can't see it now
But one day I know you will

With every passing of a loved one
The many who've gone on before use
Makes your heartache wondering why the delay

But with every heartbeat your faith grows stronger
And the Lord whispers not much longer
Your soul is stirred and comforted with these words that

It will all be worth it, it will all be worth it
For those who do believe that one day
He will crack the sky, I know you can't see it now, I know

You can't see it now, I know
You can't see it now, I know
You can't see it now, I know

You can't see it now, I know
You can't see it now, I know
You can't see it now, I know

You can't see it now, I know
You can't see it now
But one day I know you will, sure you will
