[Intro: Girlfriend]
Okay, I got my keys...and my wallet? Where's my wallet? My wallet is...my wallet is in my bag. And I've got my phone. My phone is in my bag. (Quick sigh) Alright is there anything else I need? Let me see. What am I missing? What am I missing? I'm good. Okay, let's go! I know, I know! I know! I'm on my way. I am on my way, baby. Okay, lemme check and see what he wants.....wait a minute.....hold on.....what?

[Verse 1]
This just might be the hardest thing I ever had to do
I never thought I'd see the day I'd be living without you
Now I can't even look you in the eyes
Cause I know what it does when I see you cry
And that's not what I wanna do

[Hook]
So here's my Dear John
Don't waste your time
When you respond I'll be gone
Before I change my mind
I'll just stop now and say goodbye

[Verse 2]
I realize all the promises I made to you through the years
And all the times you forgave me even when I caused you tears
But I just can't do it, can't hurt you again
You might say that I'm less than a man
But this is what i need to do

[Hook]
So here's my Dear John
Don't waste your time
When you respond I'll be gone
Before I change my mind
I'll just stop now and say goodbye

[Bridge]
I know you're probably reading this saying, "This ain't happening"
Maybe one day we'll start all over we can try again
But right now I just gotta go not coming back until I'm sure
That I ain't gonna hurt you no more

[Hook]
So here's my Dear John
Don't waste your time
When you respond I'll be gone
Before I change my mind
I'll just stop now and say goodbye

[Outro]
