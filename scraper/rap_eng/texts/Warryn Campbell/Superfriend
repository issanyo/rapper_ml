The machine

They're here now, but then they're gone
Where they at? I don't know
Ay, oh, they hit the door
That kinda friend I gotta let go

A superfriend, a superfriend
Yes sir, I got me one of them
A superfriend, a superfriend
I got me a superfriend

No sir, there's nothing half way about him
This world could never be made without him
No heart, no breath, no mind, no sun, no moon, no time
He's something like the best of them
He's nothing like the rest of them

Cause they're here now but then they're gone
Where they at? I don't know
Ay, oh, they hit the door
That kinda friend I gotta let go

A superfriend, a superfriend
Yes sir, I got me one of them
A superfriend, a superfriend
I got me a superfriend

Lord, I'm so weak and scared to run
What have I done to deserve a life like this?
The devil's scared to fight us in the light
He hides in the midst of religion
But I know that my God is listening there for me
There's a greater mission

You're no girl, you're no man, but a plan for greater peace
I'll fight for the light until my flesh falls deceased
I'm fighting the devil, fighting police
And in the church, Lord I'm looked at as Satan
Cause in my music I curse

But I'm trying to do better and that's the thing that really hurts
All this sex and the drugs in my life mean nothing
When my superfriend hugs me at night tears come rushing
There's no kryptonite, no dealing no lie that could be told

That can separate the power that you have over my soul
So stunting is a habit when I'm gripping this mic
Ya'll thinking I'm a pimp but I'm trying to be like Christ
In real life, yeah

They're here now but then they're gone
Where they at? I don't know
Ay, oh, they hit the door
That kinda friend I gotta let go

A superfriend, a superfriend
Yes sir, I got me one of them
A superfriend, a superfriend
I got me a superfriend

He heard me before I made a sound
Caught me before I hit the ground
He knows everything I need
Before I tell him anything

Loves me without requirements
Can't see him but it's evident
He's something like the best of them
Said He's nothing like the rest of them

Cause they're here now but then they're gone
Where they at? I don't know
Ay, oh, they hit the door
That kinda friend I gotta let him go

A superfriend, a superfriend
Yes sir, I got me one of them
A superfriend, a superfriend
I got me a superfriend

Can't nobody do me like my superfriend
Can't nobody do me like my superfriend, no
Can't nobody do me like my superfriend
Can't nobody do me like my superfriend, no
