K I K I
When you look at me
Tell me what you see?
Can you tell what I'm all about?
If I never ever said a word
Would my life just scream it loud
That I'm a C-h-r-I-s-t-I-a-n
That's how I represent!
If you like the music
If you like the music
If you like the music
If you like the music
Wave your banner
Wave your banner
Wave your banner
Wave your banner
Unforgettable
All together wonderful
There ain't no other way to describe
My walk my talk and the way that I feel inside is way to incrediable I can never hide
That I'm a C-h-r-I-s-t-I-a-n
That's how I represent
So if you like it
If you like the music
Wave your banner
If you like the music
Wave your banner
Now it was told to me
When the enemy
Comes in like a flood
(Ah ah ah ah ah ah)
The lord will lift up a standard
It's a banner!
If you like the music
Wave your banner
If you like the music
Wave your banner
