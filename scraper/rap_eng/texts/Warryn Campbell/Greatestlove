[Verse 1]
Girl, you came into my life
Just like a new tune on the radio
It was so beautiful even though I never heard it before
And on that day when I looked into your eyes
I realized right then that you are the one that I'm searching for
Girl, when we spend time, I just can't ignore that

[Hook]
Baby, you and me, we're so good together
Look at how we harmonize
Girl, we're like the perfect melody that keeps getting better
We can stand the test of time
All we had were letters till we formed the words
Started from the lyrics till we found the verses that can bridge us through
Baby, we could be the greatest love song

[Verse 2]
Oh girl, you truly compliment my style
Sorta like a good rhyme done to the track
You're so wonderful, these days it's so rare to find something like that
And everybody needs a little bit of inspiration
And baby, you, you're mine
Just like a guitar needs a string, girl I need you
There's no reason I could ever leave you

[Hook]
Baby, you and me, we're so good together
Look at how we harmonize
Girl, we're like the perfect melody that keeps getting better
We can stand the test of time
All we had were letters till we formed the words
Started from the lyrics till we found the verses that can bridge us through
Baby, we could be the greatest love song

[Bridge]
All my life, I've waited for you and now you're here with me
So, don't worry about a thing
And when we're old and gray, I'll still desire you

[Hook]
Baby, you and me, we're so good together
Look at how we harmonize
Girl, we're like the perfect melody that keeps getting better
We can stand the test of time
All we had were letters till we form the words
Started from the lyrics till we found the verses that can bridge us through
Baby we could be the greatest love song
