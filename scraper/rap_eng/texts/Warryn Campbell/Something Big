[Verse 1]
Hey, hey, hey, hey everybody
I got something to say
I met this man named Jesus and I ain't never been the same
You know my heart's been changed
My mind's been changed
I'm nothing like I was
Cause I was stuck on stupid
But now I'm filled with love

[Hook]
You know something big done happened to me
(Something big done happened to me)
And I gotta tell the world about it
(I gotta tell the world about)
And if I give keep it to myself
(If I keep it to myself)
How you gone find out about it
(How you gone find out about it)
Jesus took the worst of me
(Jesus took the worst of me)
And helped me get myself together
(Helped me get myself together)
Greatest man in history
(Greatest man in history)
And can't nobody do it better
(Can't nobody do it better)

[Verse 2]
And if your is soul sinking and feeling like you're lost
Don't know who to turn to, then let's go to the cross
Where Jesus bled, and Jesus died, and Jesus took the fall
But all your wrong, and all my wrong
Jesus paid it all

[Hook]
You know something big done happened to me
(Something big done happened to me)
And I gotta tell the world about it
(I gotta tell the world about)
And if I give keep it to myself
(If I keep it to myself)
How you gone find out about it
(How you gone find out about it)
Jesus took the worst of me
(Jesus took the worst of me)
And helped me get myself together
(Helped me get myself together)
Greatest man in history
(Greatest man in history)
And can't nobody do it better
(Can't nobody do it better)

[Bridge]
Tell me what you know about Jesus
(He's alright)
Tell me what you know about Jesus
(He's alright)
Tell me what you know about Jesus
(He's alright)
Tell me what you know about Jesus
(He's alright)

[Hook]
You know something big done happened to me
(Something big done happened to me)
And I gotta tell the world about it

And if I give keep it to myself
(If I keep it to myself)
How you gone find out about it

Jesus took the worst of me

And helped me get myself together

And can't nobody do it better
(Can't nobody do it better)

Now help me say, "Hey, Hey, Hey!"
