[Verse 1]
Who killed Jesus?
I thought you did
You thought I did

But He said no man takes my life from me
But I lay it down voluntarily

So
Who killed Jesus
I guess nobody

[Hook] (x2)
He laid it all down
He laid it all down
He laid it all down
Down for me

[Verse 2]
Who killed Jesus?
I thought they did
How they beat him
How they bruised him

So
Who killed Jesus
Whose to blame here
What a shame here
So much pain here

But He said no man takes my life from me
But I lay it down voluntarily

So
Who can kill Jesus
Nobody

[Chorus] (x4)

Down for me (Repeat)

Who killed Jesus
Somebody tell me
Who killed Jesus
Who had the power to do it
Who killed Jesus
I guess nobody
