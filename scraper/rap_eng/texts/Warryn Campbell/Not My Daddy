Chorus:]
You're not my daddy. You're my man
I think it's time you understand
So just make me happy if you can (Oh)
I'm not your mama, I'm your girl
And I am the lady in your world
And loving each other's how we work. (Oh)

[1st Verse:]
Trust. Without it there's no love
It's true no matter what you try
Us, there can be no us
Unless we find the strength to fight

[Bridge:]
I spy, you seek. You watch, I peek. So what are we doin' with our love? It's not how it's posed' to be

[Chorus:]
You're not my daddy. You're my man
I think it's time you understand
So just make me happy if you can (Oh)
I'm not your mama, I'm your girl
And I am the lady in your world
And loving each other's how we work. (Oh)

[2nd Verse:]
Sure, are we really sure?
Maybe we should close the door
Oh, the storms, we try to stand the storms

We've been holdin' on too long

[Bridge:]
I pray, you weep. You cry, I speak. See, what are we doin' with our love? It's not how posed' to be

[Chorus:]
You're not my daddy. You're my man
I think it's time you understand
So just make me happy if you can (Oh)
I'm not your mama, I'm your girl
And I am the lady in your world
And loving each other's how we work. (Oh)

[Hook:]
Ooh, please, come to me with sweet words like when we met. Ooh, screams. Yells & screams. Change the language that we talkin'. I'll just get to walkin'. Baby, Baby!

[Chorus x2:]
You're not my daddy. You're my man
I think it's time you understand
So just make me happy if you can (Oh)
I'm not your mama, I'm your girl
And I am the lady in your world
And loving each other's how we work. (Oh)

You're not my daddy. You're my man. [2x]
You're not my daddy, you're my...
