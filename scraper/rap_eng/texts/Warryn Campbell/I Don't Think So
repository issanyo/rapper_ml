[Chorus: backup singers]
I don't think so (I don't think so)
I don't think so (I don't think so)
I don't think so (I don't think so)
I don't think so (I don't think so)
I don't think so (I don't think so)
I don't think so (I don't think so)
I don't think so (I don't think so)
I don't think so (I don't think so)

[Verse 1: Tom Jones]
Evil wants to control your mind
Greed wants to take your time
Wrong wants to stand over right
Will you give in without a fight?
No, I don't think so
I don't think so
Hate wants to kick love to the curb
Leaders say, no need to be disturbed
Failure wants to play tapes in your head
Will you just lay there in your bed?
No, I don't think so
I don't think so
Somebody, help me say now

[Chorus: backup singers (Tom Jones)]
I don't think so (I don't think so)
I don't think so (I don't think so)
I don't think so (I don't think so)
I don't think so (I don't think so)
I don't think so (I don't think so)
I don't think so (I don't think so)
I don't think so (I don't think so)
I don't think so (I don't think so)

[Verse 2: Tom Jones]
Turn away from God above
Living in this world without his love
Run away from all the truth
Kill every sight of youth
No, I don't think so
Well, I don't think so
Help me say it one more time

[Chorus: backup singers (Tom Jones)]
I don't think so (I don't think so)
I don't think so (I don't think so)
I don't think so (I don't think so)
I don't think so (I don't think so)
I don't think so (I don't think so)
I don't think so (I don't think so)
I don't think so (I don't think so)
I don't think so (I don't think so, no, no)

[Bridge: Tom Jones (backup singers)]
[?] (I just wanna let you know)
A place we can go (there's a safe place to go)
When this world is (when the world's banging at your door)
I don't think so

[Chorus: backup singers (Tom Jones)]
I don't think so (I don't think so)
I don't think so (I don't think so)
I don't think so (I don't think so)
I don't think so (I don't think so)
I don't think so (I don't think so)
I don't think so (I don't think so)
I don't think so (I don't think so)
I don't think so

[Verse 3: Tom Jones]
Make sure the rich get more
Ignore all the cries of the poor
Only the government in charge
And the enemy, the enemy living large
No, I don't think so

[Chorus: backup singers (Tom Jones)]
I don't think so (I don't think so)
I don't think so (I don't think so)
I don't think so (I don't think so)
I don't think so (I don't think so)
I don't think so (I don't think so)
I don't think so (I don't think, I don't think)
I don't think so (I don't think)
I don't think so (I don't think so, no, no)

[Chorus: backup singers (Tom Jones)]
I don't think so (I don't think so)
I don't think so (I don't think so)
I don't think so
I don't think so (I don't think so)
I don't think so (I don't think so)
I don't think so (I don't think so)
I don't think so
I don't think so (I don't think so)
I don't think so (evil wants to control your mind)
I don't think so
I don't think so (and greed wants to take your time)
I don't think so
I don't think so (wrong wants to stand over right)
I don't think so
I don't think so (will you give)
I don't think so (will you give in without a fight I don't think so)
I don't think so (I don't think so)
I don't think so (I don't think so)
I don't think so
I don't think so (I don't think so)
I don't think so (I don't think so)
I don't think so (oh no no no)
I don't think so (I don't think so)
I don't think so
