[Verse 1:]
Thought my mistakes
Would change the way you love me
But I remember
You said you'd never go
You'd never leave
So with that in mind

[Chorus]
I'll keep marching on
'Til the sun stops from shining
I'll keep marching
'Til I'm walking with you
What you gonna do?
I'll keep marching on
'Til the water dries up in the ocean
Help me now
I'll keep marching on
'Til I'm walking with you
Walking with you

[Verse 2:]
Lost in the crowd of the city in a place where
No knew my name
Your love found me I was hiding
Barely surviving
You heard the silent cry of my pain
Now I can say

[Chorus]

[Bridge:]
And I won't let fear stop me now
And I won't let guilt stop me now
And I won't let shame stop me now
'Cause I'm marching in the name of love
And I won't let feeling stop me now
And I won't let blame stop me now
And I won't let nothing stop me now
'Cause I'm marching in the name of love

(Nothing will stop me
'Cause I'm marching in the name of love)

[Breakdown]
Ain't no stopping (ain't no stopping)
I'll keep marching (I'll keep marching)
Ain't no stopping (ain't no stopping)
I'll keep marching (I'll keep marching)
When depression tries to come (ain't no stopping)
I'll keep marching (I'll keep marching)
Holding on to Jesus love (Ain't no stopping)
I'll keep marching (I'll keep marching)

[Vamp:]
Will death stop me? (No!)
Will fear stop me? (No!)
Will doubt stop me? (No!)
No, no, no, no, no, no
Will they stop me? (No!)
Will anything stop me? (No!)
Nothing will separate me from the love of Christ
No, no, no, no
Ain't no stopping (no, no, no)
I'll keep marching (no, no, no)
Ain't no stopping (no, no, no)
I'll keep marching
