Girl, you be tripping and you know it
But I know you just can't control it

It don't matter how
Much I say or do or show you
Cause you still question
If it's really real, what I'm feeling for you
I know that people say
Things ain't always what it seems
I promise this is not a dream
I'm really here with you, and you're here with me

And before too long
You ain't got to apologize
It's all right

You always got a problem
With anything that I do

Understand everything about you
