[Verse 1:]

Oh man it's a miracle
How I came from a town, where most fall down
And never get up, I never gave up
I slipped up a couple of times, but I still raise up
Even though I'm scraped up, I keep fighting
They don't know I'm [?] up, cold sweats when i wake up
I see death as a [?], poverty, despair
Gotta kill 'em for a [?]
All the bloods, all the crips at the park to recruit
Thugs I grew up with, we used to do backflips
And drank cups with [?] pass the first sip
Higher Xscape, but can't seem to escape the middle scape
Go to act like an ape, man I can't fall for the trap
Or a state, nah, It's not a game, nah
I can't see it, I can't be it
Grown man, boy brained, locked up, going insane
In pain, late night, untamed [?]


[Hook 2x:]
A man, A man
Won't chance a thang
Maybe when I am, now I understand
A man, I'm a man

[Verse 2:]

Pops had me on the weekend,had a fifth on myself
He was preaching, he was teaching me: knowledge yourself
Jazz in the background, books on the shelf
Lil' herb, lil' liquor, go and get my belt
If my grades wasn't right, if I took school light
It was lights out, couple [?], see you later, good night
The message was clear, relate to fear
[?]
I had to go through somethin', to get me somethin'
That's how I got me somethin', and I ain't frontin'
It was though but it was worth it
If it's easy than it's worthless
But if you are on your JO, than It's workin'


[Hook 2x:]


[Verse 3:]

From a boy to a man, in between is the matrix
Baby momma's in court cases, living at three places
Keep dreaming and chase dreams, since eighteen
Nothing works, so you keep pacin' to make CREAM.
[?]
Depressed and find conflict as a player
Yeah, that was me, pitiful [?] young minded
Blinded by the alore of a whore, wildin' on tour
I had a couple dollars, but my spirit was poor
I ran my gifts in the ground, said I'm tired of it now
I didn't wanna rap, the homies kept tellin' me to take
Another lap
So I did, I never hit, I ain't a kid
I had to tell the [?] money to be a boss
I'm here to let you know, we all gotta grow
It won't stop, I keep it 100 when it comes to this hip-hop
