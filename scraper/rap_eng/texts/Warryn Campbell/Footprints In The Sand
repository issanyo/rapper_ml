What is life, if it doesn't have meaning?
We're just extras in a movie passing by

What is a man, if he doesn't have purpose?
With nothing real to show for all his time

I don't want to be, like footprints in the sand
I want to leave my mark, like the stars shine in the dark
I don't want to be, something that will fade away
A distant memory, punched out by the sea
Like footprints in the sand

For as long as I'm breathing, I will use my voice to sing what's in my heart
And with these hands, I rebuild what was broken
I will lift the ones who don't have strength to stand

I don't want to be, like footprints in the sand
I want to leave my mark, like the stars shine in the dark
I don't want to be, something that will fade away
A distant memory, punched out by the sea

Like footprints in the sand

Don't remember me, for the superficial things
Just remember how I showed my heart
And when you speak of me, oh I hope you tell the things
I did on this earth to do my part

'Cause I don't want to be, like footprints in the sand
I want to leave my mark, like the stars shine in the dark
And I don't want to be, something that will fade away
A distant memory, punched out by the sea

I don't want to be, footprints in the sand
I want to leave my mark, like the stars shine in the dark
I don't want to be, something that will fade away
A distant memory, punched out by the sea
Like footprints in the sand
