I can't see another day
I can't face another hour
Let the night reign down around me
I'm done
I don't want no sun

Mmmm...

I'm not looking for a sign
Don't promise me a change
You can leave me here in silence
I hide or run
Oh
Cause I don't want no sun
I don't want no sun no

Mmmm...

Time is nothing more
Than a theif oustside your door
Stealing all of the love we used to make

But there's solace in the dark
I'm blinded to the pain
But the dark always remembers
That it's gonna come
But I don't want no sun
I don't want no sun
I don't want no sun
Yea
I said I don't want no sun yea

Mmmm...
