[Chorus:]
Everything reminds me of you and me
I can't stop thinking bout you
I just wanna be with you
And touch you, kiss you, move you

[Verse 1:]
I got a feeling I'm about to be so gone over you, boy
'Cause I always find a way to bring you up
And not on purpose
But simply because you're all that I think of

[Chorus]

[Verse 2:]
I swear I thought I saw you walking
Heard your voice, seen your car, baby
'Cause my imagination got me seeing things
You consume me
Almost think of you every time that I breathe

[Chorus] (2x)

Everything reminds me
I just wanna, ooh

[Verse: Joi]
Here at the supermarket
Or at the park can't stop it
You're running, running through my mind, yeah
I could be at the movies
And every love scene that I see
Just makes me think of you and me
'Cause everything, yeah

[Chorus] (4x)
