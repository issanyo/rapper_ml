[Intro: JoiStarr]
Do something about it
Do something about it
What can we do about it
What can we do about it
What can we do about it

[Verse 1: JoiStarr]
Oh, I don't think you get it
No you don't even understand
Don't you feel like something's missing
So why baby, why won't you do something about it
Do something about it
And when they ask me what I'm thinking
I don't say nothing
But it's you I'm thinking about
It's you I'm thinking about
And I just don't know how to fix it
Like I don't even know what you there with her for
You know she don't make you happy, babe
And I don't know we could be happy, babe
I know it cause I see it in my head
You're living my dream, babe
You're in my heart
You're a part of me, yeah

[Chorus: JoiStarr]
I wanna do something about it
Do something about it
Do something about it
Oh, what can we do about it
What can we do about it
You should do something about it

[Verse 2: Musiq]
Oh, I don't think you get it
See what you don't really understand
There's always something missing
And I tried, baby I tried to do something about it
Do something about it
But you wasn't about it
That's why I had to just move on
Settle just to find her
Wasn't what I wanted
Even when everybody says we look so happy
But what I wanna know is how the hell am I happy
If when I'm with her, all I think about is you
I tried to let it go
I tried to forget about you, but it's impossible
You're in my head
You're in my dream
You're in my heart
You're a part of me, babe, oh

[Chorus: JoiStarr and Musiq]
So won't you do something about it
Do something about it
Do something about it
Okay, right here with you right now here to do something about it
Do something about it
Let's do something about it
