[Talking]
[Musiq] Hey girl
[Girl] Hey
[Musiq] You know I got you right
[Girl] Yeah
[Musiq] I just wish, I could do a 'lil more for ya
[Girl] I know, but, It's coo

[Verse 1]
If I had an extra dollar, I'd buy you the world
But with the change I'm makin', know I just can't, give it to you girl
Uh, Oh
And when I get a minute, I'll spend my life with you
But all the time I spend grindin just ain't enough for me and you
Now I know that

[Hook 1]
Been around, holdin' me down, for a while now
And you never ever complain about, nothing cause you know
I would take you out, and make you smile, some how some way
Even though I know its not much today
But I know we always got tomorrow, If I gotta beg and borrow
I'ma make you happy baby

[Chorus]
I promise
Soon as I get my money right, I'ma take good care of you
Oh, Oh, Oh-Oh
Just like I'm suppose to
Oh, Oh, Oh-Oh
Baby you believe me don't you
I promise
Soon as I get my money right, I'ma take good care of you
Oh, Oh, Oh-Oh
Just like I'm suppose to
Oh, Oh, Oh-Oh
Baby you believe me don't you
{​I Promise}​

[Verse 2]
Aye, Now if I had the power, I'd make your dreams come true
But when I barely sleep and hardly eat at, the end of the day I'm through
Yeah, Ah
If I could tell the future, I still wouldn't change a thing (Oh noo)
Because I know no matter what I got girl, it still won't be the same
Cause I know you

[Hook 2]
Been around, holdin' me down, for a while now
And you never ever complain about, nothing cause you know
I would take you out, and make you smile, some how some way
Even though I know its not much today
But I know we always got tomorrow, If I gotta beg and borrow
I'ma make you happy baby

[Chorus]
I promise
Soon as I get my money right, I'ma take good care of you
Oh, Oh, Oh-Oh
Just like I'm suppose to
Oh, Oh, Oh-Oh
Baby you believe me don't you
I promise
Soon as I get my money right, I'ma take good care of you
Oh, Oh, Oh-Oh
Just like I'm suppose to
Oh, Oh, Oh-Oh
Baby you believe me don't you
{​I Promise}​

[Bridge]
Aye (Aye)
My datin' days are dead and gone
Aye (Aye)
I already know that you're the one
Oh-Ooh-Oh
I'm doin' everything for us
Oh-Ooh-Oh
I can't go no where else but up
Aye (Aye)
Together we could reach the sky
Aye (Aye)
As long as I got you by my side
Oh-Ooh-Oh
Everything is gonna be alright
Oh-Ooh-Oh
Just watch me baby

[Chorus 2X]
I promise
Soon as I get my money right, I'ma take good care of you
Oh, Oh, Oh-Oh
Just like I'm suppose to
Oh, Oh, Oh-Oh
Baby you believe me don't you
I promise
Soon as I get my money right, I'ma take good care of you
Oh, Oh, Oh-Oh
Just like I'm suppose to
Oh, Oh, Oh-Oh
Baby you believe me don't you
