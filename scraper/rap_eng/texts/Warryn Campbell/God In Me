I just wanna tell the truth man [4x]

[Verse 1:]
Your so fly your so high
Everybody around you trying to figure out why
Your so cool you win all the time
Everywhere you go man you get a lot of shine
Boy like a magnet better yet I have it
Everything you wear people say they got have it
From the sweat suit to the white tee to the gucci
You can probably say people wanna get like me

[Hook:]
But what they don't know is when you go home
And get behind closed doors man you hit the floor
And what they can't see is your on your knees
So the next time you get it just tell em

[Chorus:]
It's the God in me [5x]
You think I'm so fresh you think I'm so clean
You think I'm so sweet It's the God in me
[Kiki:]
What is it, you think you see?
It's the God in Me

[Verse 2:]
You see her style you think she nice
You look at her whip you say the whip tight
You look at her crib you thinking she paid
You look at her life you think she's got it made
But everything she got the girl's been given
She calls it a blessing but you call it living
When it comes to money she can be a hero
She writes them checks with a whole lot of zeros

[Hook:]
But what you don't know is when she get home
And get behind closed doors man she hit the floor
And what you can't see is she on her knees
And if you ask her she'll tell ya

[Chorus:]
It's the God in me [5x]
You think I'm so fresh you think I'm so clean
You think I'm so sweet It's the God in me
[Kiki:]
What is it, you think you see?
It's the God in Me

[Kiki:]
What is it you think you see
When you see me, you see me
You don't know how much I pray
Don't know how much I gave
Don't know how much I changed
I'm just tryna explain

[Chorus:]
It's the God in me [5x]
You think I'm so fresh you think I'm so clean
You think I'm so sweet It's the God in me
[Kiki:]
What is it you think you see? Its The God in Me

Yeah, Yeah, Yeah Its the God in Me Yeeah
