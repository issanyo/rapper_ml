Loving you is all I wanna do in this life on earth
Because everyday we spend together is like a dream come true
And if I don't do nothing else in this life on earth
I promise that I'm gonna live it out loving you

VERSE 2:
I don't know if I can say I'm deserving (of a blessing so divine)
But I know I can fulfill my purpose (just say you'll stick by my side)
Because girl you make me better, Say that you'll leave me never
We can do this forever and forever, yeah
Because I done chose you over all my other (situations)
And you should know I'd do it again with no (hesitation)
Because baby you're the reason that now I truly believe in the meaning of love- Ohhhh...
