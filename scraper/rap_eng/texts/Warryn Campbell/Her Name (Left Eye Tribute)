[Intro]
Lets celebrate
New life
Uh huh

[Chorus]
Her name is Left Eye
And now she's flyin' high
No more tears to cry
We'll never die we'll transform
To so much more
And be happy for
That's why we stay strong

Knowing we'll see you at Heaven's door

You still live in my heart
My life is not so dark
Forever you will guide me
I look you're right behind me
You helped me believe
I could reach my dream
Without you there'd be no
B-L-A-Q-U-E

[Chorus]
Her name is Left Eye
And now she's flyin' high
No more tears to cry
We'll never die we'll transform
To so much more
And be happy for
That's why we stay strong
