[Verse 1]
Holy Spirit
I’m calling on you
Come and fill me up
And leave no space at all
My heart is open
And I am determined
To be consumed by you and you alone

Holy Spirit
I’m calling on you
Come and fill me up
And leave no space at all
My heart is open
And I am determined
To be consumed by you and you alone

[Chorus 1]
Teach me
Show me
Guide me
Know me
Live in me
Holy Spirit

Teach me
Show me
Guide me
Know me
Live in me

[Verse 2]
Like a blazing fire
And a raging sea
Ignite this passion
Stir up the gift in me
Release your power
Here in this place
You’re invited
To come and have your way

[Chorus 2]
Lead me
Use me
Testify through me
Live in me
Holy Spirit

Lead me
Use me
Testify through me
Live in me
Holy Spirit

[Chorus 1]
Teach me
Show me
Guide me
Know me
And live in me
Holy Spirit

[Chorus 2]
Lead me
Use me
Testify through me
And live in me
Holy Spirit

[Chorus 1]
(I want you to)
Teach me
And show me
And guide me
And know me
And live in me (live, yeah)
Holy Spirit
