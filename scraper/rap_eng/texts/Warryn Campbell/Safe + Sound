[Intro: Harlem Nights]
"Quik, you're not a gangster, we're not"

[Intro]
Some believe in love and some believe in friends
But niggas like me believe in making ends
'Cause even when your bitch wants to trick around
You know that money's got you safe and sound

[Verse 1]
Now I'm bout to take it back to '84, when I was 14
Kickin' back in the Trees, Westside if you please
And 436 West Spruce was the spot
With me Wayne, Mike, Shot, Nookie, Slug, and Rock
Donzelle, if you with me, just let that shit kick
If your head ain't spinning from dippin' all them sticks
'Cause way back in the day they used love a wet baggie
Screaming "Ã“rale ese" with them laces on that Caddy
And you couldn't deny a hit from that Buddah Thai
Going 'round and 'round the driveway, now it's coming my way
And I'm zoned out, at a young age
And the whole Spruce Street was my stage
Peep, now back then I was in the 8th grade steady
But niggas my age was getting paid already
Yeah, like that nigga Zap, or even young Blue
They made they first million by the age of 22
Like Dan from Cedar block, him and little Motor
James from Piru Street with them boulders
Rest in peace little Noopy, he didn't have to brag
Rollin to the 10th grade in a fin-O rag
Well Goddamn, how can I be down?
I asked my sister Jack for some help and she told me look around
Nigga, they don't sell dope, it sells itself
While they kickback and just collect the wealth
And now I'm thinking...
Ain't nothing fly about these dirty ass khakis
T-shirt dingy, Pro Wings tacky
This could be a way for me to flip that little funky twenty dollars that I earned
Right then is when I learned that...

[Chorus]
Some believe in Jesus, some believe in Allah
But niggas like me believe in making dollars
'Cause even when your niggas wanna be untrue
You know that money's still good to you
Some believe in love and some believe in friends
But niggas like me believe in making ends
'Cause even when your bitch wants to trick around
You know that money's got you safe and sound

[Verse 2]
Peep, I gets a dub on the 1st and 15th for a fact
So instead of spending it up I gave my money to Jack
Now she jump in the rig and said 'I'll be right back'
When she came in she put me down with a plastic sack
I turned my 40 into 80 and that was my profit
I'm keepin' my rocks in the house and not in my pocket
Sister Jackie's in the kitchen with some boiling water, baking soda, fresh powder, baby bottles, making more boulders
Checking a fat grip slanging rocks to tricks
Donzelly dippin' sticks, went and bought him a 6
And 500 block Peach running thangs ya see
Moving gallon after gallon and ki after ki
I'm telling you I done seen it all
From niggas hitting the sherm and then they pass out on the wall
From cluckers wanting a hit so bad they let their panties fall
Teeth rotten, hair gone, and whole checks get blown
But yet I'm still breaking these pebbles like bam bam
Safety pin splitting rocks to the, um, tic toc
I went from wearing khakis to Sergio Tacchini
While my rocks are disappearing like the great Houdini
I bought a gang of clothes, all of my equipment
And getting something new with each and every shipment
Money gets made and money gets spent
And how these jealous niggas acting only makes it evident that...

[Chorus]
Some believe in Jesus, some believe in Allah
But niggas like me believe in making dollars
'Cause even when your niggas wanna be untrue
You know that money's still good to you
Some believe in love and some believe in friends
But niggas like me believe in making ends
'Cause even when your bitch wants to trick around
You know that money's got you safe and sound

[Verse 3]
Check it, now in 1988 I moved away to L.A
My niggas Playa Hamm and Gina gave me a place to stay
On my way up from bottom rock
Bitches starting to jock
'Cause my hair is getting longer
And game's getting stronger
To pull my own weight, I went and got me a job
But by then, Hamm and Gina really started to squab
About whether I should go or stay
She told him 'Either he goes or you go'
We both was on our way
So he moved and took me with him on 2001 Browning
Clowning with players all around me just astounding
My nigga Pimpin' Carl got us staring with that hair and
Rolling up and down the street in that rag 7 with Darren
Shabby Bleu feathered as he swerved
In the El Co, P7's park away from the curb
Big Jam, L.A Mike, Darryl, Nicky on the bike
That nigga Top, Big Shane, and Tweed rolling up the weed
And hoes just come and go, in and out
Revolving door leaving with some nut in they mouth
I'm making a living off of pimpin' so you fools can't trip
'Cause even though I love God, I also love my grip

[Chorus]
Some believe in Jesus, some believe in Allah
But niggas like me believe in making dollars
'Cause even when your niggas wanna be untrue
You know that money's still good to you
Some believe in love and some believe in friends
But niggas like me believe in making ends
'Cause even when your bitch wants to trick around
You know that money's got you safe and sound

[Outro]
Ooh, ooh yeah
Safe and sound, yeah
Safe and sound baby
Ooh, ooh, yeah
Safe and sound yeah
Safe and sound
Gotta let you know
Gotta let you know
Gotta let you know
Compton's in the house
