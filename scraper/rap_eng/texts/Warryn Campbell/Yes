Why say no, when you can yes?
It's so easy, come on and say yes
You can change your life
If you can say yes
Not tomorrow, but today, yes
Everybody's got them days when they down
No one to call on, nobody around
You wanna smile, but you can't smile
Hurt so many times you can't count
All the tears you've cried
So now you hold it all inside
Falling apart, can't keep it together;
So many questions
Well, here's the answer...
Voices, voices, so many voices
Choices, choices, so many choices
Everybody is in authority
Magazines and the TV screens
If you look around, it might seem to be
We livin' in a state of confusion
Don't get caught up, it's all an illusion;
It's just a test so you won't say yes
(I know, I know)
You can do what you wanna
Say what you wanna, but
(no, no, no, no)
You can't make it out there alone
(I know it's hard but listen to this song)
Over and over, 'til ya get it in your heart
And you understand you can't
(can't live, can't breathe)
(can't be without Him)
I'm tryin' to tell ya about Him
