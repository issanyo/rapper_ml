Went too far and I almost cussed
No, my mama didn't raise me that way
Lord, I need a little help today

Problems at work, problems at home
Won't everybody just leave me alone?
I can't fix you cuz I'm trying to fix me
I'm tryin' to find help so I'm on my knees

Gotta ache right here, pain right there
Not enough power needed way more prayer
Seems like it's so hard to pray
Yes that's why I lost my way

I need just a little more Jesus
I need just a little more Jesus
I need just a little more Jesus
I need just a little more Jesus
Hey I need just a little more Jesus
I need just a little more Jesus
To help me along my way

I need just a little more Jesus

To help me along my way

To help me along the way
To help me along the way
To help me along the way
To help me along the way
