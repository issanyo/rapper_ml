[Chorus]
How did we ever get to this place?
How did we ever get to lose our way
When we're the same two people
Started out beautiful
But now I'm finding it strange
In a very different time and space
Running after things that lovers chase
That's when we forgot to look both ways
That's how we ended up in this place

[Verse 1]
Girl we used to ride, we used to chill
There was never any question about it
The way I made you smile, the way you made me feel
And I never had to guess about it
Somewhere down the road, we got misdirected
But I wish someone had told me, expect the unexpected
I got caught off guard, not lookin' where we are
Maybe I should stop and ask somebody

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
Movin' through the night, lookin' for a thrill
We thought we'd search until we knew we found it
We left on a joyride, like we had time to kill
Never stopped to take a look around us
See the engine smoking, here we go again
Our GPS is broken, it's no coincidence
I guess to call it fate, wouldn't be the wrong play
Its how we went the wrong way
How do we get back

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
And now we're stranded in the land of indecision
And the future and the past obstruct my vision
And see like we're livin' in a dream there's no escapin' from
Don't know which way to run, we gotta end where we've begun

[Chorus] x2
