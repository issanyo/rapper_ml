[Verse 1]
What's somebody gotta do
To get some real good love out here
Tell me how can I prove to you
I've got what you really want right here
Does anybody know out here
Everybody's so cold out here
I'm all alone out here
Just wanna be a part of something real

[Pre-Chorus:]
Bet you didn't know
You already knew about everything you've been up to
You should already know
It's a small world out here, ah yeah
The crazy thing about it
I still give you the benefit of the doubt
Even though it seems you ain't never gonna come around

[Chorus]
You can play all the games you want to play
All the lies, yeah they might work and get you by
But in time, probably sooner than later
You're gonna mess around and wake up
And ask yourself who really loves you, girl

[Verse 2]
Shorty you fine but you can't lean on your looks forever
You’re gonna always be beautiful, I’m just saying you could do so much better
Yeah I know it seems like it but I ain't always gonna be here
Waiting on you to make up your mind
So I thought we try to give it a ride
Or we could just leave

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]
You can play all the games you want to play
All the lies, yeah they might work and get you by
But in time, probably sooner than later
You're gonna mess around and wake up
And ask yourself who really loves you, girl

[Hook:]
So, out of all the people in your life
(Who really loves you, girl)
Don't let it be too late before you realize
(Who really loves you, girl)
Yeah, instead of letting them get away you should hold on to
(Who really loves you, girl)
Cause you don't wanna look up one morning
Only just to find yourself alone, no

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Who really loves you, girl
Who really loves you, girl
(Who really loves you, girl)
Who really loves you, girl
Who really loves you, girl
(Who really loves you, girl)
Who really loves you, girl
Who really loves you, girl
(Who really loves you, girl)
Who really loves you, girl
