It hurts me so bad, to see you cry
And to know it's because of me
It's never my intention, my intentions are good
But I know it doesn't even ..

And suddenly your actions are so different
You don't even look at me the same
Do you think that maybe we could talk it over to see?
If we could get back, cause I believe that

[Chorus]
We can work it out, we can work it out
We can work it out, we can work it out
We can work it out, we can work it out
Whatever, whatever, whatever, whatever it is
We can work it out, we can work it out
We can work it out, we can work it out
We can work it out, we can work it out
Whatever, whatever, whatever, whatever it is

Don't give up now, before we try
All there is to try, we've got so much invested
Through all these years, just to throw it away

And suddenly your actions are so different
You don't even look at me the same
Do you think that maybe we could talk it over to see?
If we could get back, cause I believe that

[Chorus]
Oh, I can't even lie, can ever imagine it would be another guy
Oh that would just break my heart
I can feel the hurt just from the thought
And anyway this is not even what you are
You're just looking for me and step it up
And that's what I'll do, if that's what it takes for me and I know its you

[Chorus]
