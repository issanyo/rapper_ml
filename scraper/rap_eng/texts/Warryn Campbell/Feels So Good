Chorus
Feels so good. Feels so good. feels so good. feels so good, feels so good

Yeah now after all the years of drama all the time must wonder I couldn't see if he love me love me not had me always questioning I'm in the heart in my belief no insecurities put the smile back on my lips the swing back in my hips and it feels so good

Chorus

I never knew it could be this way

Hey I'm going to finally do it my way finally know it's ok to take care of me you can love me or love me not that don't really bother me cause now I'm trading in my fears and insecurities gonna let my self forgive and free myself to live and it feels so good

Chorus

And I never knew that it could be this way

And I never thought that I could believe that this is real and I never thought that I could ever feel the way I feel no I never thought that I would out live the lonely years but now I'm smiling you see the light in me and it feels so good

Chorus End
I never knew it could be this way

I keep smiling keep shining baby it feels so good
