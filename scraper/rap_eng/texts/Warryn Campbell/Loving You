[Chorus]
Loving you
Makes my heart sing a song
Knowing you
Makes all the pain go away

[Verse 1]
So sick of the beautiful
Ain't no cure or no remedy
And if loving you is wrong
Charge me, I'll take a rap for the felony
And in due time all the same
I see us one day making baby melodies
I never thought it'd be you and me
Then I mess around and fell on a knee

[Chorus]
Loving you
Makes my heart sing a song
Knowing you
Makes all the pain go away

[Verse 2]
Honestly to tell the truth
It was cool when it was cool, yeah
I was out there doing me
And you was out there doing you
So (let's admit it) I wasn't looking for the one
(No commitments) need to try to get some
Now look at how far we've come
Who would've thought this would be more than a crush
Back then we was young and wild
Wasn't nothing you could tell
Family wasn't slowing down
Wasn't thinking about tomorrow
We was living for the now
We had time to chat [?]
And you would settle but look at us now
We was like apples and oranges
Talking about a love so far
We both fly and we know it
So I put my name on that thing
Keep it going cause

[Chorus]
Loving you
Makes my heart sing a song
Knowing you
Makes all the pain go away
Loving you
Makes my heart sing a song
Knowing you
Makes all the pain go away
