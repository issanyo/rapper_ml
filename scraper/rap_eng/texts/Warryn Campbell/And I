[Intro: Kirk Franklin]
As we attempt to acknowledge how incredible You are
We become speechless
At the thought of Your name

[Verse 1]
There's a name so powerful words can't describe
When spoken demons tremble
And all creation must bow down

[Pre-Hook]
Awesome are Your ways
Every day the same
And majesty is Your name

[Hook]
And I give You all my worship
And I wanna sing Your praise
And I long to honor You more than yesterday

[Verse 2]
There is not any other who can compare
To your word, Your life
Your love's ultimate sacrifice

[Pre-Hook]
Awesome are Your ways
Every day the same
And majesty is Your name

[Hook]
And I give You all my worship
And I wanna sing Your praise
And I long to honor You more than yesterday

[Bridge]
You're everything no one else can be
You filled every space that was empty
Lord, You are everything to me

[Hook]
And I give You all my worship
And I wanna sing Your praise
And I long to honor You more than yesterday

[Outro: Kirk Franklin]
It's Yours
We recognize You
What a name (And I)
First and last name
The only name
How awesome You are
