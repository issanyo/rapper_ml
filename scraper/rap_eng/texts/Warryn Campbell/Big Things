[Verse 1:]
I'm leaving even though
They don't think I should go
They say that I'm dreaming
But they really don't know
There's more things to life
Than they've even heard of
And I want a piece of it

[Chorus:]
I'm trying to do big things
I want to go places
All around the world, yeah
Tell me do you feel me?
Wanna do big things
I'm trying to do big things
I want to go places
All around the world, yeah
Tell me do you feel me?
Wanna do big things

[Verse 2:]
Don't knock me for wanting
More than one karat rings
I guess that's expected
That's all they've ever seen
If they've seen what I've seen
And been where I've been
I bet they wouldn't knock me then

[Pre-Chorus:]
Put yourself in my position
Even my friends said I wouldn't make it
(Player hating chicken heads)
But I can't let it hold me down
No, no, no
So wave you on ahead
"Move around!"
'Cause I'm trying to do...

[Chorus]

[Bridge:]
Bet you'd be happy if
I stayed in the hood forever
But I'm not having it
I got to get out of here
Telling me to keep it real
I look at you and say
"Whatever, man. I gotta get this cheddar. Heard me?"
You heard me?

[Chorus] (3x)
