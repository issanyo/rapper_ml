[Verse 1]
You could be a good girl
You could be a great guy
Same rules apply, do or die
You can love her one day
Hate him on the next day
No one really knows when or why
Maybe you had a hard day at work
She had a hard day too
And now you both have an attitude, yeah
But just remember that you both
Love each other very much
So go ahead and make up

[Chorus]
No matter how hard you try
There ain't no getting by the hard times
It's always gon' be something
No matter how positive you live
Or how much love you give, I'm telling you
It's always gon' be something
Always one thing after another
Just keep living, you'll discover
You can't let it stress you out
It's just a part of life, I'm telling you
It's always gon' be something

[Verse 2]
You could have a good love
You could have a rich love
Same rules apply, do or die
Either it'll make you, baby, it'll break you
You will know the outcome in time (time)
He's gonna make you cry
She's gonna tell a lie
But you need to know that
If it's really love (love)
That fight-for-it love (love)
You gotta hold on, 'cause

[Chorus]
No matter how hard you try
There ain't no getting by the hard times
It's always gon' be something
No matter how positive you live
Or how much love you give, I'm telling you
It's always gon' be something
Always one thing after another
Just keep living, you'll discover
You can't let it stress you out
It's just a part of life, I'm telling you, oh
It's always gon' be something

[Bridge]
You can find a new man
It won't matter and
If you find a new chick
It won't matter 'cause
Cain't run away from life
Whether it's good or bad
So take the good with the bad
And try to make it last
'Cause love is all we have, love is all we have

[Chorus]
No matter how hard you try
There ain't no getting by the hard times
It's always gon' be something
No matter how positive you live
Or how much love you give, I'm telling you
It's always gon' be something
Always one thing after another
Just keep living, you'll discover
You can't let it stress you out
It's just a part of life, I'm telling you
It's always gon' be something
It's always gon' be something
It's always gon' be something
