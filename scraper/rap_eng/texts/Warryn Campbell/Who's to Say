[Verse 1]
I ain't really into PDA
We could hold hands if you like
When we out in public we could spend the whole day together
Long as we get to spend the night
And we could get to some things
Get it crackin' till the sun rise
Pass out, wake up, chill
Talk about whatever comes to mind

[Bridge]
Anything any other couple does we do
Just cuz we don't put a label on it that don't mean that it ain't true
What we got going on just works for me and you
So let's not ruin it tryna prove it cuz

[Hook]
Who's to say what we have ain't real
I mean girl who's to say
Who's to say, Who's to say
Who's to say what we do or don't feel
Who cares either way
Who's to say, Who's to say

[Verse 2]
We ain't got to play these games
I mean where do people get off
Talking about what we're supposed to be doing
Like it one size fit all, hell to the nid-aw
Look, love don't make no mistakes
And you can't front on who holds your heart
I know it don't seem like it from afar
But you know I been about you from the start

[Bridge]
Anything any other couple does we do
Just cuz we don't put a name on it that don't mean it ain't true
What we got going on just works for me and you
So let's not ruin it tryna prove it cuz

[Hook]
Who's to say what we have ain't real
I mean girl who's to say
Who's to say, Who's to say
Who's to say what we do or don't feel
Who cares either way
Who's to say, Who's to say

[Verse 3]
No matter what you do these days
Somebody always got something to say now
It's 'cuz it's hard to explain
Prove that you can throw your love away now
What I'm tryna say, ain't always gone be sunny days
But it's all in how you think
Why go complain, but you could loose a day

[Hook 2x]
Who's to say what we have ain't real
I mean girl who's to say
Who's to say, Who's to say
Who's to say what we do or don't feel
Who cares either way
Who's to say, Who's to say
