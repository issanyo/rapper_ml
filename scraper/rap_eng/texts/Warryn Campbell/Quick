When you left me couldn't believe it
I thought that we had magic
I thought that we were special
But it's over, how?
Believe it... I can't
Fathom this terrible reaction to checking my phone

Damn your madder than a mad hatter, quick
Can't believe it's over, quick
Can't you come over, shit
I miss you darling, hee
I'm a one man lover, I'm not a Casanova
I can't believe its over so, quick ah ah
I called you, you didn't call me
I wanted you, you didn't
Return my message, how could you be so, thick

Had a lot of woman on you
Didn't like the fact that I, wanted to own you
That's what you said to me

Said that, I wanted to lock you down
But you moved into my house
Gave me a son, mhm mhm mhm
It was so, quick
The way that it happened, quick
The way that you left me, quick
Can't believe it's over, can't believe it's over now

I loved you, I really loved you
Can't believe that's its over
Can't believe that we would ever spilt

I feel it my stomach
I can't seem to move on
I'm sick, from the knots that happening, ah
Medicine just ain't helping
I can't seem to get well and

Over, can't believe it's over
Over, can't believe it's over
Over, can't believe it's over
So quick

Over, can't believe it's over
Over, can't believe it's over
Over, can't believe it's over
So quick
