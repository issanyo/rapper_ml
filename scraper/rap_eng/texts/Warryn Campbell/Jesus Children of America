[BeBe Winans:]
Hello Jesus
Jesus children
Jesus loves you
Jesus children
Hello children Jesus loves you of America
[Stevie Wonder:]
Are you hearing
What He's saying?
Are you feeling
What you're praying?
Are you hearing, praying, feeling
What you say inside?

[Chorus]
You'd better tell your story fast
And if you lie it will come to pass

[Stevie Wonder:]
Tell me holy, holy roller
Are you standing like a soldier?
Are you standing for everything you talk about?
[BeBe Winans:]
Oh say now Jesus meditation
It speaks of inner preservation
Jesus told us meditation gives you peace of mind
Peace of mind

[Chorus]

Tell the story, brother Marvin!
BeBe & Marvin, do you mind if I do this?
Stevie can I say this?

[Marvin L. Winans:]
Tell me junkie if you're able
Are your playing cards on the table
Are you happy when you stick a needle in your veins?
[Stevie Wonder:]
Jesus died on the cross for you
Mary is just looking at you
Mother Mary feels so, so much pain

[Chorus]

Can we do it again?
