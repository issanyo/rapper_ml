[Chorus: Joi]
Everything reminds me of you and me
I can't stop thinking bout you
I just wanna be with you
And touch you, kiss you, move you

[Verse: Joi]
I got a feeling I'm about to be so gone over you, boy
'Cause I always find a way to bring you up
And not on purpose
But simply because you're all that I think of

[Chorus: Joi]
Everything reminds me of you and me
I can't stop thinking bout you
I just wanna be with you
And touch you, kiss you, move you

[Verse: Joi]
I swear I thought I saw you walking, heard your voice, seen your car, baby
'Cause my imagination got me seeing things
You consume me
I almost think of you everytime that I breath

[Rap: Jadakiss]
Everything reminds me of the time you used to take sips of the Dom and sit by the pond
Conversate about real-life issues for long
Up until the time I start kissing your arm
Couple seconds from there your neck and your ear
Now we at the point where I'm disconnecting your gear, yeah
I just wanna be, uh huh
Be with you too
To touch you, kiss you, move you, boo boo
Make sure the feeling's mutual
And just know who's who so this way you won't lose me and I won't lose you
And we won't lose us and we won't lose trust
And do what we do, ma
But I'm with you, ma. (Mmm, Everything)

[Chorus: Joi]
Everything reminds me of you and me. (Reminds me, woooah)
I can't stop thinking bout you
I just wanna be with you. (I just wanna, Ooh)
And touch you, kiss you, move you

[Verse: Joi]
Being at the supermarket or at the park can't stop it
You're running, running through my mind, yeah
I could be at the movies and every love scene that I see just makes me think of you and me
'Cause everything, yeah

[Chorus: Joi]
Everything reminds me of you and me. (Ooh)
I can't stop thinking bout you
I just wanna be with you. (I wanna be with)
And touch you, kiss you, move you. (Ooh)

Everything reminds me of you and me. (Everything, yoo, wooah, yeah)
I can't stop thinking bout you
I just wanna be with you. (I just wanna be with you, yeah)
And touch you, kiss you, move you
