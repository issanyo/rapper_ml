Speculations are that there's many way to get up there
I have a different view to share
I don't claim to be a know it all
But I know someone who knows it all
And whatever He says I believe, so there can only be just...

Chorus
One (way to get where he is)
One (only life to give)
So I gonna do what I gotta do so I can be counted
Just one (gave up His life for you and me)
And then one (sacrifice to make us free)
So no matter what you heard
When it's all said and done, there's only one

Verse 2
There's people searching everywhere
Coming up with nothing but thin air
Talking to a God who isn't there...
If I had to sum it up I'd say
There ain't enough time in a day
To tell you everything he's done
But I can tell you that there's only

Chorus
One (way to get where he is)
One (only life to give)
So I gonna do what I gotta do so I can be counted
Just one (gave up His life for you and me)
And then one (sacrifice to make us free)
So no matter what you heard
When it's all said and done, there's only one

Bridge
Under the Son there's only (one)
Name that I call on only (one)
Who when I'm in trouble, I give the glory to (one)
There is no higher (one)
That I love to worship, above your name there's none

Chorus
One (way to get where he is)
One (only life to give)
So I gonna do what I gotta do so I can be counted
Just one (gave up His life for you and me)
And then one (sacrifice to make us free)
So no matter what you heard
When it's all said and done, there's only one
