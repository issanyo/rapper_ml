[Intro]
Hold up, wait a minute

[Verse 1]
I've been out here trying to get in anything
But I feel like with you I might have found the one
I was busy tryin' to win them all but what's the sense in that
Baby girl, you're all-in-one
All this time, all this time
I was trying to hide, but I ain't know what I was running from
And you've been holding down for a while
I think it's time to make a real now, like...

[Chorus:]
One two three, see?
It's so easy
What more can I say?
I'm feeling you
It's so simple
I'm getting into some things that I said I'll never do
I think I'm in, wait a minute
I think I'm in love with you
I think I'm in, hold up, yeah
I think I'm in love with you

[Verse 2]
I'm a keep it real
I've been doing some BSing enough but now I'm ready, yo
Cause if you ever left I wouldn't be right
Don't you know we go together like stereo
And you've been going hard for you and me
And I would be an idiot to ever let you go
And I ain't ever been a dummy, so
I got a plan for you and me and this is how it goes

[Chorus]
One two three, see, it's so easy
What more can I say? I'm feeling you
It's so simple, I'm getting into
Some things that I said, I'll never do
I think I'm in, wait a minute
I think I'm in love with you
I think I'm in, hold up, yeah
I think I'm in love with you

[Bridge]
It might have took us a little while, but we made it
Out of all of them other girls, you was always my favorite
You could cook, you're so clean
Got your head on right, plus your body's so lean
Got a lot in common, yeah, we like the same things
Now it's all patched up, you're the only one I need like

[Chorus]
One two three, see, it's so easy
What more can I say? I'm feeling you
It's so simple, I'm getting into
Some things that I said, I'll never do
I think I'm in, wait a minute
I think I'm in love with you
I think I'm in, hold up, yeah
I think I'm in love with you

One two three, see, it's so easy
What more can I say? I'm feeling you
It's so simple, I'm getting into
Some things that I said, I'll never do
I think I'm in, wait a minute
I think I'm in love with you
I think I'm in, hold up, yeah
I think I'm in love with you

[Interlude]

[Verse 3]
Sky people [?] come from the same peace that you've given me
It's something about your presence, it's a present, it's a gift to me
Girl I'm in the house but you ain't fall down no chimneys
Tell your parents like to take a hike and I throw them a tender key
Getting it in [?] running like I was from [?]
Girl, you already know ain't nothing mini 'bout the mini-me
Foreplay your art class, the sex is the symphony
Have you busting them back-to-back like I wanted fifty feet
But I wanna crash land into you and become dead to to the world
I put the work like I was on set with Drake and Rihanna and them
Uh, never got your homie, your mama, and them
Started with something like a prayer like Madonna and them
Like a virgin but I ain't judge, your honor and them
Taught you, how to take it when I ate it like ramen and them
You looked into my eyes and said you're going Obama on them
That's when I said I'm busy chasing O's with commas in them
But I'm tired of Jasmine, Nicole, and Shanna and them
Plus nothing ever hurt worse than thirteen roses
See girl, I got your heart and two hands to hold them
Good love

[Bridge]
But it took us a little while but we made it
Out of all of them other girls you was always my favorite
You could cook, you're so clean
Got your head on right, plus your body's so lean
Got a lot in common, yeah we like the same things
Now it's all patched up, you're the only one I need like

[Chorus]
One two three, see, it's so easy
What more can I say? I'm feeling you
It's so simple, I'm getting into
Some things that I said, I'll never do
I think I'm in, wait a minute
I think I'm in love with you
I think I'm in, hold up, yeah
I think I'm in love with you
