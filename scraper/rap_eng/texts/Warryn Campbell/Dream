I've told myself time and time again
That I'm not in love with you
And then
It came to me
One night in a dream
You mean more to me than I wanted to see
There is nothing I can do
To stop it
Even though you're with somebody else

If I didn't really care, why were you there?
The color of you eyes, the scent of your hair
I know dreams aren't reality
But you're so real
So real to me

(chorus)
It took a dream to tell me that I love you lady
I couldn't see that you were always there for me
Remembering the time we shared together
Came clear to me one night in love

I tossed and turned and broke a sweat
Woke up with tears my pillow's wet
I'm drowning in a river of my homelessness
And only you can save me now
I've got to find someway, somehow
To let you know how i feel inside
Cause it's so obvious and hard to hide

If I didn't really care, why were you there?
The color of you eyes, the scent of your hair
Now i know dreams ain't reality
But it's so real
So real to me

It took a dream to tell you that I love you lady
I couldn't see that you were always there for me
Remembering the time we shared together
It came clear to me one night

Chinky:
And it came clear to me one night
I am in love
And what can i do
And what can i say
To let you know that i feel the same
Please don't walk away
Cause i know i can't be wrong

Sisqó:
And my dreams they can't be wrong

It took a dream
To tell me that i love you baby
Cause i could not see that you were always there for me
Remembering all of the times we spent together

Sisqó:
Came clear to me one night

Chinky and chorus:
It came clear to me one night
It took a dream
To tell me that i love you baby
Cause i could not see that you were always there for me
Remembering all of the times we spent together

Sisqó:
Came clear to me one night
I fell in love
