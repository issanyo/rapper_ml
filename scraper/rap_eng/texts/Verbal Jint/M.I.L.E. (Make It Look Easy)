[Intro: Black Nut]
Wassup Show Me The Money 4, 1st competition track
Yeah, Microdot, sorry
It’s Black Nut uh!
Yeah, reboot! uh!

[Verse 1: Black Nut]
I told my mom, when I come back to this house
I’m gonna have a bus filled with beautiful girls
I’ll look like a lung disease patient and come back with a bouquet of money
So get ready to move
Piss off rappers, I have to pay off my mom’s debt, put away your rice bowls
I can’t write this part because it’ll get banned, so just listen to the original song
If I’m foam, you’re just money spoons, put them all away
My skills of hitting this scene is like a game of ttakji, I flip it all over1
You remember me ever since I was recording and posting my own music
But I eventually floated above the water, tightly holding onto Swings’ belly fat
Yeah I know, it’s not my skill that got me here but just luck
But there’s no other like me, a guy with the spotlight without having any work done
I’m like a pillar of a Korean traditional house
The main pillar of this scene
Clap for me like the body cleanser at the public bathhouse
Then I’ll flip over
Fuck Zico, fuck Paloalto
Fuck AOMG, fuck YG
My hope is to push even my team off a cliff

[Hook: Black Nut]
I make it I make it
I make it look easy
I make it I make it
I make it look easy

I'm rockin,’ I'm rockin’
I'm rockin’ with easy
I'm rockin,’ I'm rockin’
I'm rockin’ with easy

Easy so easy easy easy so easy
Easy easy so easy easy easy so easy
I go hard but what?
I make it look easy
I go hard but what?
I make it look easy

[Verse 2: Verbal Jint]
Funny how time flies
Life just gets faster
Seems like yesterday I bought my first car
But I’m already looking for my next
My career was half pessimism, half optimism
But now it’s gotten quite secure
So many people ask me for career advice
And people think I’m in my prime time
Hold on, I used to stay up all night in a small room
Writing an album after Modern Rhymes
And doing work to please my strict college professor
I remember how I studied at the same time
I had a cheap, domestic speaker
But I worked until the girl next door knocked on my door
I think the style I had from then kept going even after 10 years, It’s so amazing

I make it, I make it, I make it look easy
I make it, I make it, I make it look easy

[Verse 3: San E]
I make it look easy
It looks easy on the outside
But you gotta do it to believe it
San E, that crazy
They wonder how I do it
I just go forward
Boosting my two feet
Look look look at my Yeezy
Like Baek Jong Won’s cuisine
That’s my place
Switch switch, wanna switch places with me?
SNS Twitter losers
This song is the shit to bring the money tree
The hook is coming up now
So everyone jump as if you promised to

[Hook: Black Nut]
I make it I make it
I make it look easy
I make it I make it
I make it look easy

I'm rockin,’ I'm rockin’
I'm rockin’ with easy
I'm rockin,’ I'm rockin’
I'm rockin’ with easy

Easy so easy easy easy so easy
Easy easy so easy easy easy so easy
I go hard but what?
I make it look easy
I go hard but what?
I make it look easy

[Outro: Black Nut]
Man, we just made it look easy boy!
Sorry, I don’t really know English
I just spit it out
