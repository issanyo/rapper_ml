You tryin' to tell me
What we could have been
Where I should have been
'stead of 무대 위
Studio, video shoot 대신
(instead of all that)
아마 이건 priority 차이
네 눈엔 어제오늘이 다
내 눈엔 내일만이 보이니까
(that's all I see)

What's said is said
And what is done is done
과거가 되어버린 걸
되돌릴 순 없는 건
알고 있잖아, do I still love you?
잘 몰라 당장은
Gotta wait and see
Cause it's all about timing
(all about timing)
