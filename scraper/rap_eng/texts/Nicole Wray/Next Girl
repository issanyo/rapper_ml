[Verse 1]
Well the look on the cake it ain't
It ain't always the taste
My ex-girl she had such a
Such a beautiful face
I wanted love
But not for myself
But for the girl so she could
So she could love herself

[Chorus]
Oh my next girl
Will be nothing like my ex-girl
I made mistakes back then
I will never do it again
Oh my next girl
She will be nothing like my ex-girl
It was a painful dance
Now I got a second chance

[Verse 2]
Oh her beautiful face and her
And her wicked ways
And I am paying for her beautiful face every day
All that work over
Over so much time if I
If I think too hard I might lose my mind

[Chorus]
Oh my next girl
Will be nothing like my ex-girl
I made mistakes back then
I will never do it again
With my next girl
She will be nothing like my ex-girl
That was a painful dance
And I got a second chance

[Outro]
Oh my next girl
Yeah
My next girl
