[Intro:]
[Missy Elliott:] Yo

[Nicole Wray:] (mmm) You know (mmm)
I don't know what's up with this cat
But I know
I know he's gonna be mine

[Verse 1:]
[Missy Elliott:]
Yes, I'm the supa dupa
I'm the superstar
I got a super flow
That goes super far

I need a super man
That's got a super tan
That can deactivate my body like the Superfriends
Uh huh

[Nicole (Missy Elliott):]
Was the finest guy in school (say what?)
He got the whole damn school locked
And I thought he was cute (uh huh)
Wanna see
I had to stop
Boy how are you? (uh)
And by the way, Nicole is my name

So I slipped him my number
Showed him how us began
(Hey yo, freaky freaky uh)

[Chorus:]
Call me
If you need someone to talk to
Call me
Even though I'm seventeen
Call me
When you need someone to talk to
Call me
Call me

[Nicole Wray (Missy):]
(Brrr mmm)
He was only seventeen
And I was checkin' him everyday
And he's no beginner
He made me hot like filled with me
I gotta find a way
To keep all his attention to me

So I slipped him a paper
Told him hit me off at three
Hey (uh, call me)

[Repeat Chorus:]

[Bridge:]
[Nicole Wray:]
(Yes, I know I really want him)
Really want him
(Yes, I know I really need him)
Really need him
(Yes, I know I gotta have him)
Gotta have him
(You can call me up in the evening)
Call me up

(Yes I know I really want him)
Really want him
(Yes, I know I really need him)
Really need him
(Yes, I know I gotta have him)
Gotta have him
(You can call me up in the evening)
Ooh yeah

[Repeat Chorus:]

[Verse 3:]
[Nicole Wray (Missy Elliott):]
(Nicole Wray)
So what the sunshine
What's yours is mine
You won't succeed without trying
Never blind

See I'm the type of female to hold on
Like deodorant I roll on
And gets my flow on (uh huh)
I'm livin' in reality
Respect me

My image is not a pocketbook
And I won't get took
Girls get shook when they look
My style is John Blaze (John Blaze)

So I'ma make it hot and leave somebody in a daze
My age is seventeen
Call me
My age is seventeen

[Missy Elliott (Nicole Wray):]
