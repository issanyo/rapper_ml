Mama always warned me bout boys like you
She said that all you wanna do is run over me like shoes
And takin' take me to ya crib and try to find somethin' sweet
Wanna be the first to run and tell, you took my virginity
But I know I'm gon' hold out until I know bout love
Kisses and hugs, I'm sure that that will be enough
If you just wait, I'm gonna give it to you
But before I do, this is what I want you to do

Boy you should listen, listen
Baby I ain't concerned, I ain't concerned
I know you think I'm flippin', know
You won't catch me sleepin', you won't catch me sleepin'
Boy you should listen, you should listen
Baby I ain't concerned, I ain't concerned
I know you think I'm flippin', know, know, know
You won't catch me sleepin', won't catch me sleepin'

All the other girls, they are grown as me
Saying all the stuff they done, now they wanna know about me
I tell em bout me and you, how we be holdin' out
And no matter what they say, we're gonna show 'em what love is all about
So when we finally do the thing it's gonna be fine like wine
Ooh, take some time to make sure it's right
So far as me and you, this is what we gon' do
But you must listen first to what I'm a say to you

Boy you should listen, boy
Baby I ain't concerned, baby I ain't concerned
I know you think I'm flippin', ooh
You won't catch me sleepin', won't, won't, won't catch me sleepin'
Boy you should listen, ohh
