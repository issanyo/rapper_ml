Let's don't let the he say, nor the she say
Get in the way 'cause this love we have is much to strong
Please don't wait too long just to seperate over child's play
I promise you're the only one on my resume that's on everything
I thought you knew I love you

Will you raise your frown?
You don't have to worry
I won't let you down
Baby calm yourself down

Will you raise your frown?
You don't have to worry
'Cause I'm not happy, when you're mad at me
Don't take your love away

And after the rainy days there are sunny days
In the future for us baby let's celebrate
Look how far we've made it, oh, oh, nothing but trust
We fuss, we fight but I know soon it will be alright
I can't ever see myself without you, oh I love you
How long are you gon' be mad at me?

Will you raise your frown?
You don't have to worry
I won't let you down
Baby calm yourself down

Will you raise your frown?
You don't have to worry
'Cause I'm not happy, when you're mad at me
Don't take your love away

'Cause I need you, yes I need you
Do you hear me? Boy I need you
I adore you, and I' for you
'Cause I love you, yes I love you

None above you and I mean it
That's forever, my forever
I treasure us together
What can measure? What can measure?

Will you raise your frown?
You don't have to worry
I won't let you down
Baby calm yourself down

Will you raise your frown?
You don't have to worry
'Cause I'm not happy, when your mad at me
Don't take your love away

Will you raise your frown?
You don't have to worry
I won't let you down
Baby calm yourself down

Will you raise your frown?
You don't have to worry
