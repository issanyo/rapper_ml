Relax
And just and just and just
Relax

[Verse tabi Bonney]
*Entice* I'm taking the whole cake while others settle for a thin slice
They don’t know about my DNA, geno-type
Won’t ever see me locked, rocking horizontal stripes
Sky scraper views, up here, I swear I can conquer the world in about a day or two
As my girl bubble gum chews, such a beautiful mixture
The scene is fondu
We livin’ life like, we in the sun light, all day and all night
Dreams are life like, and they come true
This is my world now, you should come through
Redecorated knock down a couple walls then we elevated
Added more floors we on the elevator
On our way up, to the stars, we out a here babe
Au revoir

[Hook Nicole Wray]
Ohh, feeling more, feeling more [feeling?] baby
Ohh, feeling more, feeling more [feeling?] baby
Ohh, feeling more, feeling more [feeling?] baby

[Verse 2 tabi Bonney]
Exotic pedigree, up in these heels chilling out with Beverley
Everything's pink, beauty's going to be the death of me
Samantha Ronson is in charge of this gorgeous medley
Daily paper gets you influence from neighbors
Fit and [riding?] without a trip to the tailor
Nonbelievers in DC caught the vapors
If you really knew me you’d know I'm a freak of nature
I’m so far removed from a day-shift
Like a K. West College Dropout playlist
I don't got a boss, so you can't say shit
We laughing at them bamas at work nodding off
They used to be us until I left work one day
And all I got in return was a good luck
And that good luck turned into a good look
Because now I'm pissing on the game without the seat up

[Hook]
Ohh, feeling more feeling more [feeling?] baby
Ohh, feeling more feeling more [feeling?] baby
Ohh, feeling more feeling more [feeling?] baby
