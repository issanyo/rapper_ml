[Instrumental Intro]

[Chorus: Lady Wray]
Like sweet morning dew
I took one look at you
And it was plain to see
You are my destiny
With you, I spend my time
I'll dedicate my life
I sacrifice for you
I dedicate my life to you

[Instrumental]

[Chorus: Lady Wray]
Like sweet morning dew
I took one look at you
And it was plain to see
You are my destiny
With you, I spend my time
I'll dedicate my life
I sacrifice for you
I dedicate my life to you

[Outro: Lady Wray]
You're all I need to get by, by
You're all I need to get by, by
