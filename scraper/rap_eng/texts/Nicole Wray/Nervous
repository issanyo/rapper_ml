[Lil' Mo - Rap]
Yo, what the deal son
Pulling up to my crib
If you ain't call before you came, yo you ain't gettin' in
It's just as simple as that
So don't get left around
You better get on, you came with
And be gone before sundown because I'm comin' out swinging
Soon as I hear the bell ringing (ding), you got five seconds to count (4-3-2)
To get off my cement
And uh wait for my place before I call Jake
And have you locked up on your birthday
And the keys thrown away

[Nicole - Verse One]
Boy I could've sworn that I told you that
All those other phone numbers in my pager don't mean jack to me
So if you gonna start actin' crazy
Save it
Don't even try to play me for your own uncalled insecurities

[Chorus]
When all I ever do is give you my time (my time, my time)
We be fightin' over the stupidest little things (little thing, little things)
The way you actin' lately, it's not right (not right, no no it's not right)
So if you're gonna be shady
Then i can't be your lady
No more

[Nicole - Verse Two]
Boy how many time I gotta tell you that
When I'm on the road I can't answer my phone every single time it rings
Next time you leave a message, stop
Thinkin' and screamin' that I'm cheatin'
You know that's not my steez

[Repeat Chorus]

[Nicole - Verse Three]
Baby what I do
To make you feel this way
I never thought you'd change
Espically towards me
You've been saying things, that's
Makin' me believe, you're so insecure
And the reason is 'cause me

[Repeat Chorus x3]
