[Verse 1: Q-Tip]
B-B-B-Bouncing off the walls like a round ball, Spalding
Spinning off the rims no baskets falling
Just another basket case stricken with the lonelies
Invoke the man, out through the tenderoni
Wouldn't leave the children, left a little alimony
Nothing in my cupboards just stale macaroni
Need me some sustenance, find me a bottle
Went into my paper as I stripped you a bottom
Yeah

[Hook: Q-Tip & Nicole Wray]
I hope you're happy
(You know I am baby)
Can't be happier than me
(You know-ow-ow it's true)
I hope you're happy
(I'm happy now darlin cos I got you where I want you to be)

[Verse 2: Billy Danze]
All of a sudden I'm the bad guy
Why cos I gave you everything?
Crib, cars, cash, bling
Average, sorry that just isn't my thing
Lavish bitch, I had you living like a queen
Well established, to the point you wouldn't stop to think
That if you step out on your boy
Ya probably wouldn't say
Being a groupie for Black Keys
I know it come with benefits
I lifted you from your knees
To show you what exquisite is
Please bitch, Things change ain't no robberies
So while you was in the back with that
You girlfriend Jen, was slobbing me
Its probably in the script for us to take it down

[Hook: Billy Danze & Nicole Wray]
Now I hope you're happy
(You know I am baby)
You ain't happier than me
(You know-ow-ow it's true)
I hope you're happy
(I'm happy now darlin cause I got you where I want you to be)
