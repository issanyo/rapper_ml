[Intro]

[Verse 1: Nicole Wray]
Block out the sun
Block out everyone
'Cause I'm down here
I need you
But we're through
And you won't come around, do you?
Tried to be cool, actin' a fool, waitin' around
For the phone, but I don't hear a sound

[Hook: Nicole Wray]
Things don't change, they stay the same
If you let 'em
He's on my mind, 'bout all the time
Why can't I forget him?
Why can't I forget him?

[Verse 2: Nicole Wray]
The city streets
Won't let me sleep
'Cause everybody's watching me
Rather be dead than
Face what's ahead
Stranded out on the street
Tried to be cool, actin' a fool, waitin' around
For the phone, but I don't hear a sound

[Hook]
