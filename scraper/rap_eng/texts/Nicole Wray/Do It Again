If you wanna pack your bags, go on ahead
Ain't no use in being friends if you can't hear what I'm saying to you
One of us needs to say it
Stop dragging it in the dirt now
One of us gonna get hurt now
So hard when you know it, the love has left the building
And we can't talk about it

We roll the dice
And we lost in the end
Though our luck has run out, yeah
I would do it again

You know all the good and bad things that I've done, yeah
You're the best I've ever had, you pull me through
Baby, I rely on you
The two of us, the two of us needs to say it
Stop dragging it in the dirt now
One of us gonna get hurt now
So hard when you know it, the love has left the building
And we can't talk about it

We roll the dice
And we lost in the end
Though our luck has run out, yeah
I would do it again

Before I go, oh
Yeah, and again and again now
And again and again now

We roll the dice, yeah
And we lost in the end
Though our luck has run out
I would do it again

Baby, I would do it again
Do it again
Oh, do it again
Oh, and again and again now
And again and again now
Ooh, do it again
