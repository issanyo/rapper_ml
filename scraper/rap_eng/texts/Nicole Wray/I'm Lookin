Mmmm-mm.... Said I'm lookin
I'm lookin, mmmmm
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Ohhhh.. Mmmm-hmmm

I'm lookin for someone to hold onto
I'm lookin for you, I'm lookin for you, I'm checkin for you
I'm lookin for someone that I can trust
I'm lookin for you, I'm lookin for you, and baby it's you
I'm waitin on you to say those words
I'm waitin for you, I'm waitin for you, I'm patient for you
I'm thinkin bout how it would be at night
You holdin me tight, you squeezin me tight all through the night

I've been all around
I said I been here and there and everywhere
And I have not yet found you
But until then I know my heart is true
But I can't wait, anticipate, it's getting harder
So much love inside, and I still have not yet found
Someone for me, truly for me

I gotta quit foolin myself
Thinking I'm gonna be fine, wastin my time
I wanna be like everybody else
I wanna fall, I wanna see, what about me
Will I ever fully be complete
I know there's someone waitin for me
So if you're listenin, baby rush right over
Cause I need you next to me

I've been all around
I said I been here and there and everywhere
And I have not yet found you
But until then I know my heart is true
But I can't wait, anticipate, it's getting harder
So much love inside, and I still have not yet found
Someone for me, truly for me

If I could trade my fame and all my jewelry
You know that I would cause it don't mean nothing to me, babe
All I need is the warmth of a man, the strength of his hand
Let me sing it again

If I could trade my fame and all my jewelry
You know that I would cause it don't mean nothing to me, babe
What I need is the warmth of a man, the strength of his hand
Let me sing it again

I've been all around
I said I been here and there and everywhere
And I have not yet found you
But until then I know my heart is true
But I can't wait, anticipate, it's getting harder
So much love inside, and I still have not yet found
Someone for me, truly for me
