[Nicole Wray]
Knew this girl, from my hood
Coming up, she was young
For her sake, I won't mention no names
But she was ready for trouble
Only child, running wild, 17 in the mix
To the fiend's and the gangster's
Like a fool, she fell in love with a hustler
Not afraid, played the game
It was sold, never told
So she played, anyway, that she could
Cause all she knew was the struggle
Ain't no doubt, baby girl, was to lost and turnt out
But she prayed, anyway, every night, wondering where did the love go

[Chorus]
And so she can't get out of the game
She's crying all the time, and she can't stop
But, she don't know what else to do
She don't know else to doooooo
2x

And when that, little girl, took a ride, with this dude
That she thought, was her man
But didn't understand, that he didn't love her
You could tell, by the look, in his eyes
That this guy, he was colder, than ice
And drive her in the hood, but never let her go
So they stopped, at the light, they were smoking and drinking
Never noticing, creeping up slow, was a blue El Dorado
Within a blink, of an eye, threw the passenger side, of his ride
Shots fired, and she cried, all you could see, was the blood flow
She's in trouble

[Chorus]


[Beanie Sigel]
Same hood same mind frame, am I to blame
Shorty caught up in the struggle, addicted to my hustle
It's fair game, I ain't have to strain
The thought of her strapping those things to her frame man
She did it from the muscle
I explain after the rain, the sun'll shine again
After difficulty coming, you gotta feel the pain
Devil's advocate, leading her to the flame
She no different than all the Lauren's, and Tiffany Lang's
Like a moth, she was drawn to the light of chain
Stood tall in the storm, late nights in the rain
Not knowing the flip side of the game, those boys drawn to same
Plus the law, put shit in the game
And once addicted to the game, its hard to maintain
Like a smoker, when he first take a pull of the Caine
Plus the game, bring the name, and the change, and the fame
Once again, man I ask, who am I to blame

[Chorus]
