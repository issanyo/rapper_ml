It's morning
And you're still right here with me
I wish I could call in
And take off the rest of the week

I know your girl's thinkin'
Where the hell can you be?
But the good love that you're giving to me
It's a shame you've got to leave me, baby

You don't belong to me
And I don't belong to you
No matter how hard we try
We're still on borrowed time

You still go home to her
So you can't belong to me
Although it feels so right
We're still on borrowed time

Somehow I wish I'd find some way
To make you all mine and I mean only mine
You feel so good, how good? Too good
My heart says it's no use 'cause you're leavin' soon

We'll never get away
Still day by day
But it's killin' me, oh yes, it's killin' me
'Cause I know that you're feelin' me, baby

You don't belong to me
And I don't belong to you
No matter how hard we try
We're still on borrowed time

You still go home to her
So you can't belong to me
Although it feels so right
We're still on borrowed time

You gotta stop callin' me
And tellin' me
I'm where you'd rather be
It's been nineteen weeks

And you're still playin' your games everyday, no
I would never ever want to hurt her, no no
So I'll take the initiative and let you go
Until you're ready to come home to me

You don't belong to me
And I don't belong to you
No matter how hard we try
We're still on borrowed time

Baby, the hardest thing is gonna be
Is gonna be getting over you so easy
You know when I gave you my all everyday
But it's best for all of us to move on
'Cause no matter what I think we'll be
You'll never belong to me

You don't belong to me
And I don't belong to you
No matter how hard we try
We're still on borrowed time

You still go home to her
So you can't belong to me
Although it feels so right
We're still on borrowed time

Somehow, some way
All mine, only mine
So good, too good
Whoa, too much borrowed time

You don't belong to me
And I don't belong to you
No matter how hard we try
We're still on borrowed time

You still go home to her
So you can't belong to me
Although it feels so right
We're still on borrowed time
