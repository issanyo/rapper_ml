[Mike Jones]
Who?  Mike Jones - who, Mike Jones, who Mike Jones
Geyeah!  Holla at your boy
Y'all know my cell phone number, geyeah!

Everyday I stay on my grind, and I hold it down 'til I'm not around
I mash for cash so I can eat, I grind so much that I hardly sleep
I'm pimpin the game, grippin the grain, under 25, gettin this change
A CEO at twenty-fo', holdin it down for that Texas mayne
Mike Jones, Nicole Wray, we stay on the grind, we don't play
In Fila {?} forever stay, puttin it down, for that pay
It's a man's world, that's what they say
But I think girls get {shit} they way
But who am I to argue and bust
I don't give a {fuck} you can kiss my nuts
I'm steppin out, hoppin in my Lo
Grippin on grain, tippin on Vogues
"Who is Mike Jones?" finally here, so go and pick it up out the sto'
I said - I'm steppin out, hoppin in my Lo
Grippin on grain, tippin on Vogues
"Who is Mike Jones?" finally here, so go and pick it up out yo' sto'

[Chorus: Nicole Wray]
It takes a lot to be in a man's world
Believe it or not, I'm runnin for my girls
Holdin it down, ridin through yo' block
And if you get hot, I show 'em what I got
It's a man's world.. it's a man's world
It's a man's world.. but it wouldn't be nothin without me and my girls

[Nicole Wray]
Baby girl was workin real hard nine to five
Boss man came through, told her come inside
Said he didn't need her service no more
And everything she worked hard for out the door
First thing she did is thought about the kids
And how to pay the bills and keep food in the fridge
She said, "No!  This ain't right!"  Looked at him and said
"It's a cool world, and I'm destined for greatness"

[Chorus]

[Nicole Wray]
It's a man's world.. it's a man's world
It's a man's world.. but it wouldn't be nothin without me and my girls

Couple years later, see the girl doin fine
Big ol' house and bright diamonds that shine
Drove by the old job, seen the old boss
Splashed water in his face, music loud and drove off
See what he ain't know, baby girl was gifted
Tried to hold her down, hold her back but he missed it
She's her own boss now, she stay gettin lifted
Party hard with her friends, stuntin on the fakers
Y'all ain't never seen no face like this
Bass like this, haze like this
Y'all ain't never seen no cash like this
Floss like this, boss like this - this is what she say to y'all
Y'all ain't never seen no face like this
Bass like this, haze like this
Y'all ain't never seen no cash like this
Floss like this, boss like this

[Chorus]

[Nicole Wray]
It's a man's world.. it's a man's world
It's a man's world.. but it wouldn't be nothin without me and my girls

(Mike Jones! Mike Jones!)
It's a man's world.. whattup Dame?  Whattup Devin?
It's a man's world yeah... yo, it's a man's world
And it wouldn't be nothin without me and my girls

[Mike Jones]
