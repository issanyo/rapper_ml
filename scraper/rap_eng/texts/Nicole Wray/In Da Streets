[Missy - Rap]
Uhh, 1-2, hit me
Dag nigga, let me breathe
Let me know, what you need
Why you keep on, asking me
Where I go, and why I leave
Can I kick it, can I relax
Can I kick it, I be back
Can I kick it, what's up with that
I know you mad, and that's a fact

[Nicole - Verse One]
My man, he got an attitude, cause
He think I been messing 'round, but
All I do is just sit at home, and
Wait until he return my call, and
Why is it that he don't trust me
Is it that he's the one messing up, see
I should be the one who's questioning
Why my man is always asking

[Chorus (sung by Missy and Nicole)]
Where I been
Where I go
Who I'm with
Am I out , messing up
When will I, be back
Am I out, in the streets, doing stuff
(repeat x2)

[Nicole - Verse Two]
My man, he been acting crazy
He thinks I been changing lately
He thinks I been out here spotting
And if he ask me, I'll tell him where I been
I been home just waiting, waiting
He been out just playing, playing
My man, he don't want me to go nowhere
Then if I go, he needs to know

[Repeat Chorus]

[Bridge {Missy} and Nicole]
Oooh, oooh {uh huh uh huh}
Oooh, oooh {uh huh uh huh}
Oooh, oooh, listen to me sing {and all the ladies say}
Oooh, oooh {uh huh uh huh}
Oooh, oooh {uh huh uh huh}
Oooh, oooh {uh huh uh huh}
Oooh, oooh {where I been}

[Repeat Chorus]

[Mocha - Rap]
You jokin' right
Wanna grab this open mic
Peeps got you all hyped
Thinkin' that you flowin' tight
But you knew, that's the way it had to be, baby
M-O-to the muthafucking-C-H-A
Must be crazy
Competing with ours
Broken out, your copper whip, that got too many miles
What you think, can't even get the wheels on my ve-hi-cle
Any year, we in style
You ain't here, we got power
