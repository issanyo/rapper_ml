Chea!
The judge tryna to slam the gavel on me, wylin on me
Fag niggas taking the stand, them niggas rattin' on me
Said I had a couple of bundles and the gat was on me
Any hopes and dream I had? Shit shattered on me
I'm finna do a couple of years
That means my family is 'bout to shed a couple of tears
OT like why the fuck I'm hustlin' here
Niggas lookin like "Why the fuck Duffle is here?"
So I grab my nuts tell 'em that the Duffle is near
And believe me that's a whole lotta trouble to fear
Now niggas wanna talk to police
They don't care if they labeled rats and never gonn' walk on the streets
Fuck a bid, rather lay in the coffin asleep
But it's only short-time so of course I'ma beast
Try to stay to myself, just talk to my peeps
But if you want it then I will go to war for the beef
Why niggas so jealous though? Like I got mega dough
Still got dreams of Papi giving me mega-blow
I gotta talk to my fam, I gotta let em know
Send my girl down, just listen to what I tell her though

I'ma have to do some time
I commited a crime
It went right over my head, got the best of me
Now I'm stressin everyday, live my life behind bars
I just want to be free, hope the jurors spare me
Dont throw away the key, why the gotta come mess (with) me
They don't wanna see me succeed
I was drinking whole lotta Henny, whole lotta weed
Just wanna feel the breeze on me
If you take the key, don't throw it away
I'm gonna see the sun some day

Ain't nobody really forced me to serve white
20 exits from the turnpike and now I'm facing my third strike
God don't fear me baby, I'm religious now
26 years I only been to my church twice
Shit is ironic, used to not smoke
Now I'm twisted tryna find Chronic, hit the strip like hydraulics
And I'm still hustling, gotta get the lawyer bread
If I get caught, I'm finished, I can't ignore the feds
Just move quite and cautious
That's what I tell myself, just don't force it
10 o'clock sharp I'm gonna be in his office
And he talking goin to jail and I get nauxious
Thinkin bout my daughter and all the cute shit
You never know what you got until you lose it
Know that my heart is pure but I can't prove it
Now they bout to lock me away and I can't do shit
Fuck it, I might as well just wild out
If a nigga talkin slick I'll rip his eyes out
Send a nigga a kite, if you can take the time out
Ever been indebted to the world? I'm 'bout to find out

[Nicole Wray]
Well if I got to do the time, they better get ready
They better get ready for me
Whole lotta Henny, whole lotta weed
Just wanna feel the breeze on me
If you take the key don't throw it away
I'm gonna see the sun some day
My life ? locked, it's a shame
Now I'm with the chain gang
The judge tryna to throw me the book
Lawyer get me off the hook
My life ? locked, it's a shame
Now I'm with the chain gang
The judge tryna to throw me the book
Lawyer get me off the hook
Whole lotta Henny, whole lotta weed
Just wanna feel the breeze on me
If you take the key don't throw it away
I'm gonna see the sun some day
