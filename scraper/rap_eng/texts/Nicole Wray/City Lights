[Hook: Nicole Wray]
City lights wherever you are I’m solely drifting into New York

[Verse 1: Najee]
Yo everybody want to be heir to the throne
They like wait till I get it
Ain’t no crown in New York cause Biggie died with it
Corona and limes what I’m sipping
Stare at the page configuring ways to write different
Yours and my life is in no way compatible
My upbringing would have mentally damaged you
I let the ink tell it, deep stories in my melons
Stories of perseverance, refusal of failing
Money making Manhattan turn a snot nose into a captain
Life and times told through rapping
Home of the haze there’s plenty of ways to get paid
Beware of aids, killers with no names known to spray
Pretty mommies with plenty booty
Bodegas, parked outside, you got the chummy churies
Old timers playing dominos dropping jewels
If you listen then you guaranteed to glisten in it

[Hook]

Uh another worm out of The Big Apple
Where I earned my stripes like Mickey Mantle
Word to the torch held by The Statue of Liberty
You cannot un-Kindle me
It’s a love-hate relationship damn near
My family was lost to the cracks here
So I learned every block, observed every crack here
Po-9 finds us a very big catch here
Lights camera action
Welcome to Manhattan the city I run laps in
Harlem through the Heights and the Bronx son
The hood's Mike Johnson
Made moves in gold shoes
Green in Oz's, Bk throughout Queens they know the 2 Es
Victim of the system, child of the state
Overlooking the city I see my face in

[Hook]

Yo, Naj the Don, urban version of The New York Times
The city’s in my every line
I project the ghetto where
Projectiles eject out the metal
Be clear, the unbalanced attitude will get you leveled out here
Navy Blue fitted with the NY logo
Lees and a discrete Polo moving dolo
Roll with a G through this cold concrete
On these streets life’s lost over Bs and Cs
Dot all Is cross those Ts
Check both sides when you cross those streets
They shoot things
Damn I love this surface 80s baby Kool Herc helped birth this
Where heroes were made through heroin
5 boroughs, the most thorough in
