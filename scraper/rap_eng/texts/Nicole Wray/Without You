I dont know wazzup with you, but I just want to tell you, to me your like my sunshine and you really really make me smile, and I just wanna let you know that without you I have nothing, I mean nothing, to be happy about

[Verse 1]
Can't you see that I'm missing you, and I don't know why I feel tha way that I do, only you can take my mind away, through all the pain and what I gotta say

[Chorus: x2]
Without you I have nothing to be happy about, nothing to be happy about
I have nothing to be happy about,oh

[Verse 2]
How can i make you change your mind, cause you found me, you'll never find another girl

Chorus

[Bridge]
Heart and soul is what I have for you no other love could ever be so true so only you can take my mind away only the same thing comes every day can't you see that I'm missing I don't know what I'm gon do only you can take my mind away I need to know if your going to stay

Chorus till fade
