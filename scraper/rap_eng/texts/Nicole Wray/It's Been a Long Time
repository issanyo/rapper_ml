Have I been hiding, wasting all my days?
Did I give up on all my dreams? No, no, no
My heart is beating, I'm alive like a baby
Today is the day that I succeed

It's been a long, long time
It took a while to find my way
It's been a long, long time
But I got it now

Hello sunshine, it's time to get on the road again
'Cause you been sleeping far too long
A cup of coffee will sure wake you up, I know
Opportunities knocking at your door

It's been a long, long time
It took a while to find my way
It's been a long, long time
But I got it now

Been a long time, been a long time
Got it now
Been a long time, been a long time
Got it now

It's been a long, long time
It took a while to find my way
It's been a long, long time
But I got it now

But I got it now
But I got it now
But I got it now
Yes, I got it now
Yes, I got it now
Yes, I got it now
