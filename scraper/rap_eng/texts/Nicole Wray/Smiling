Remember when we were young and free?
Simple games like hide and seek
We used to laugh even through the pain
Will we ever get back to the way things used to be?

Just keep on smiling (Just keep on smiling)
Just keep on smiling (Just keep on smiling)
Just keep on smiling (Just keep on smiling)
Just keep on smiling (Just keep on smiling)
Just keep on smiling (Just keep on smiling)
Just keep on smiling

Show me all your teeth, please don't hide your face
Even when you're losing the race
Mama said there'll be days like these
There'll be ups and downs swing you 'round in place

Just keep on smiling (Just keep on smiling)
Just keep on smiling (Just keep on smiling)
Just keep on smiling (Just keep on smiling)
Just keep on smiling (Just keep on smiling)
Just keep on smiling (Just keep on smiling)
Just keep on smiling (Just keep on smiling)

Just keep on smiling, oh yeah

Just keep on smiling (Just keep on smiling)
Just keep on smiling (Just keep on smiling)
Just keep on smiling (Just keep on smiling)
Just keep on smiling (Just keep on smiling)

Just keep on smiling

Just keep on smiling (Just keep on smiling)
Just keep on smiling (Just keep on smiling)
Just keep on smiling (Just keep on smiling)
Just keep on smiling (Just keep on smiling)
Just keep on smiling (Just keep on smiling)
