Make It Through First
I Will Do The Boss Check

Ain't Nobody Gotcha Ur Back
Somebody Might Be Waiting For Ur Love
There'll Be A Submitted Value Takes U In
Like A Road (Uh Huh)

(Hook)

I Know How You Feel (I Know You Feel Hurt)
You Just Don't Get Whats On My Mind (On My Mind)
But U Will Know What It Means To Be A Good (Bissy) (Yeah!)
