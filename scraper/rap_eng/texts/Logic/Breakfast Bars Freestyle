[Beat 1: A Tribe Called Quest - Can I Kick It?]
Check, check, check, check, check
Uh come on, come on
We 'bout to get it, 'bout to
We 'bout to get it, check it, check it
You know the deal, always gotta keep it real
Mass appeal from that Tribe Called Quest
Touchin' on your girl breast
Maybe not, I'm a married man
This is how we do it
Can you carry man tell me can you feel it
When I get it, when I spill it, gotta get the vibe
The Incredible True Story yeah
It's kinda gory but the flow is hella whore-y when I get it like this
And this is how we do it uh
You know the flow is hella funny with the swag bunny
Chillin' with the team
This is how we do it Wu-Tang killer with the C.R.E.A.M
Kill a beat, kill a fleet, killer with the free
This is how we do it yes it's L-O-G-I-C
I'm out in L.A
This is how we do it all the time
Miraculous man, miraculous rhyme and I'm
Strictly spittin' this off the top, this how we do it
And this is how we gotta get it
Everybody goin' through it
Just stay motivated, never hate it
And uh...it doesn't matter as long as you escalated
Elevated to another level, word to the Devil
I keep it real, G-O-D, it's all about me
Aside to this, this is how we do it when we rhyme with this
We got more beats?
We got more beats?

[Beat 2:]
Listen, I'm 'bout to do it one more time for your mind
And this is how we do it, spit it, hella divine
Uh, I'm on the incline or rather on the increase
And this is how we do it can you get it like a new species
Word to y'all, y'all flow faeces
This is how we do it when I get it and it's hella crazy
This is random thought, it's just a freestyle
That's how you know it's real
I might repeat myself once or twice but the flow is still nice
When I get it rip it I get it and bringing it back
I never slack, half white half black
I said it once said it twice
Pneumatic device inside my brain, insane
And this is how we do it, never go against the grain
Switch it up, bring another beat on in
Cause this is how we do it and the flow it gon' begin

[Beat 3:]
Come on, come on, check it
I keep goin' and goin'
And this is how we do it
Can you feel it when I spit it, gotta get it, goin' through it
'Bout to bring 'em back that 90's like 1990
When I get it so high, so high like Bone Thugz
When I rip it and get it and like this
And this is how we do it all excite this
I don't even know, this is what I love
I remember watchin' cats like Mos Def freestyle
In the park, after dark, just talkin' random thought
That might not even necessarily..come off the dome like that
But it sounds good, this is how we do it in the hood
And I wish a motherfucker would
On that Yeezy, can ya see me
This is how we do it
I know all these other motherfuckers wanna be me
But it doesn't matter like brain matter when it splatter
And I gotta keep it goin', ass way fatter, yeah
And she..know she love it, the second I get it there's nothing above it
Like this, like that y'all, it's like that y'all
Keep it goin' y'all
So keep it flowin' y'all
Give me another beat now
Come on, give me another beat now, yo, uh, check it

[Beat 4:]
Uh, it's kinda crazy that the album out
It's kinda crazy that the album out, you know
Who know what that boy gon' do first week
But that boy good
They say that boy good
That L-O-G-I-C I bring it back again
I gotta attack again, the second I get it like I'm Maccin' and
This, you know I got it like Akira, the second I got it the spirit is all up in me
On that Cowboy Bebop anime, shoutout to the homie Steve Blum
Where I'm from can I, can you get it, can you come?
Roll through, this is what it really do
I'm just havin' a good time with the rhyme
Uh, we at the radio station, chillin' on the PlayStation
Never hestitating when we got it, uh
Uh, Han Solo on my...Mary Cruz masturbatin', nah
But real talk when we get it, this is how we do it, let me spit it, let me rip it
Let me have a good time with the rhyme with the swag bunny
Flow hella funny and I
I keep goin' over beats on beats on treats on treats, retreat
Never get it when I do it nah
You can never sleep, unless you sleepin' like that Tryptophan
At Thanksgiving, I'm giving, I got it, I'm winning, I'm winning, you know it
This is how we do it nah never dismiss this
One of the illest, artists at Cali Christmas
So come through and understand I'm just a miraculous man
And it's all part of God's plan
The Incredible True Story go get it on the shelf
At Best Buy or Target, I'm not the target
The market, the one, the realest, the killest, you feel this
And this is how we do it right now yes it's Logic

[E-Man]
I'm gonna go on the record by saying that was probably the best Breakfast Bars we've had

[Beat 5: Method Man - Bring the Pain]
Yo what is this Bring the Pain
When I spit it so insane
Gotta bring it back again, never go against the grain
I love it, this is how we do it shoutout to the homie E-Man
He can keep on spinnin'
I'mma be killin' it, spittin' and grinnin'
This is how we do it, take it back to the beginning like that
Oh, when I was back up in the basement
It's kinda crazy, people lookin' at me crazy
Now I wonder where they face went
I sold a couple records and broke a couple records
And now everybody wanna act like
I ain't coming for they neck like a necklace
When I wreck this, never protect this
I'm on that Wu-Tang, kill the beat, kill the game
Said it once, said it twice, yeah
It doesn't matter if I repeat it, rinse, lather, rebead it
When I get it I skeet it all over
And this is how we do it like I'm Jay HOVA, the best
The best, no contest, I gotta get it
I'mma lay it to rest

[Beat 6:]
Oh my God, are we goin' again?
I gotta do it from the top nah lettin' that record spin
It's kinda funny cause I'm not tryna curse in the verse
But fuck all that
Half white can I get it, uh
And I gotta get it like that
It doesn't matter always bring the pain
Always do it hella crazy
This is how we do it can you feel it
Got the fitted on the hat, matter fact it's a snapback, clap back
This is how we do it, never cop that, uh
I ain't even making sense, past tense, present tense
But I'm livin' in the moment
Atonement, the second I got it they want it
But I can never give it to 'em
This is how we do it, live it to 'em
Or rather, better yet I'm livin' with 'em
I'm in it, I get 'em
And if you don't understand it, I demand it
You gotta bring it back again, The Incredible True Story on the shelf
Come on do something for yourself
Go buy yourself a copy, never Carbon
This is how we do it when I'm on and I'm walkin'
I'm never talkin', matter fact I'm talkin'
But I talk the walk, I walk the walk
We preach but we practice
This is how we do it hella crazy and that's it, Logic
