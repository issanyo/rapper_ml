[Lyrics from Snippet]

[Verse 1: Logic]
God damn, this shit is viscious
Because my main bitch in this world is really my mistress
Feel like I knew this already
Like I been through this already
I'ma have to do this already
In my mind, yes I done it, yes I run it
Keeping it 100
Flow crazy, shit is amazing
No it don't ever faze him
Yeah, they takin' shots, but they never graze him


[Hook]
And if I open my mind, what I hope...
I said if I open my mind, what I hope to find is real
And if I open my mind, what I hope to find is real
I said if I open my mind, what I hope to find is real
