[THALIA:]
Destabilization complete, prepare for departure...

[KAI:]
Took you long enough!

[THOMAS:]
Oh, I'm sorry, your highness. I'll have to try and ask the asteroid field I had to detour through to not try and kill me next time!

[KAI:]
Man, I'm just messing with you.

[THOMAS:]
Yeah, whatever...

[KAI:]
So what'd you do on the way over here?

[THOMAS:]
Um, you know—just listening to some oldies...

[KAI:]
Oldies? Like who?

[THOMAS:]
Logic

[KAI:]
Logic? The fuck you know about Logic?

[THOMAS:]
I just listened to his first album on the ride over!

[KAI:]
Under Pressure?

[THOMAS:]
Yeah, that's the one!

[KAI:]
Shit...

[THOMAS:]
I was actually gonna put in the second one now

[KAI:]
Alright, well—you know this was the album that changed everything, right?

[THOMAS:]
I know, that's why it's so important...
