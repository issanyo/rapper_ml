[Verse 1]
Said this a freestyle, it's strictly off the top of the dome
I'm in N.Y.C, about two thousand miles from home
I'm in the zone, murder your chromosome in an instant
Hit it like killer instinct
The second I get it, it's so hypnotic
Goddamn, I'm a miraculous man
I grip the microphone and this is how we do it, E.T phone home
I'm on another constellation when I spit it
This is how we do it, yes I rip it, yes I gotta get it
This that Mos Def, Illadelph, The Roots, Black Thought
The shit that never taught
Goddamn, can you feel it now
R.A double T.P.A.C.K all day, every day yeah
Just having a good time spittin' this rhyme
Never written cause that shit is forbidden, feelin' sublime, goddamn
I said I'm feelin' myself, goddamn, feelin' good, I said I'm feelin' my health
With my homie Big Kenny to the right of my side, with my homie, homie Nick to the left of my side
Gotta spit it, gotta rip it for that Maryland pride
You know the dilly, this is how we do it, word to Philly
And everybody in that Tri-state, watch me migrate to the moon and back, goddamn
God-goddamn, I'm just feelin' this villainous vibe
L.O.G.I.C, we gotta get it, peace to The Tribe Called Quest
Uh, take one to the chest, gotta wear a vest, never the less
Might cop a motherfucken' feel on your bitch's breasts
I'm just having a good time, having a good time
Once again I said none of this shit is written, phone out of sight
This is how we do it, goddamn feelin' hella right
Yea I'm feelin' good and yea I said I'm vibin'
This is how we do it with my homies and we tribin'
Freestyle, the art of a rhyme, this is random thought
Once again, I said this is shit that can never be taught, yea

[Verse 2]
It's the type of shit they read about
Like Chris said, I gotta bleed it out
I've been in the zone, I can't be without
This real shit that I be about
I'm a visionary, that's long term
But Def Jam, said they need it out
If I rush this shit, I might be without
But I need a vision, can't see without
I've been patient, never complacent
Left the underground when I left the basement
That's renovation, I spit this verse like a revelation
On the road with Kid Cudi and Big
Conversations with No I.D
Who made hits with Ye, got hits with Jay
Now he wanna fuck around and make hits with me
If it's meant to be, then it's meant to be
Can't express what that meant for me, what it mean to me
Man, I swear the shit like a dream to me, what it seemed to be
It's so different now, everything is so different now
I've been there and I've done that
Tell 'em all that I run that, that's a fun fact
And I'm back again cause I never left, I said that real shit
A little bit of written, but it might be forgiven
Goddamn, I'm living
That's how I'm living
I said I got it, L.O.G.I.C this is how I'm living, yeah
