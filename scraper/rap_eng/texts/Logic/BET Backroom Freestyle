[Intro: Rhetorik]
What up y'all, welcome to 106 & Park BET Backroom
My name is Rhetorik, out here for Visionary Music Group
One time for the Rattpack
Ayo Logic, think it's about time you wake these people up!

[Verse 1]
For my real homies that hold me down
Thanks to y'all they can't hold me down
Seem like everybody know me now like I owe 'em something
They've been around
Bitch I've been the same, y'all know the name
Never let the fame affect the game
When you do that shit through, give a fuck about what you've been through

[Hook]
Money change people that's right it change people not me
Seems like the only people my money change is the people not around me
Seem like my phone going crazy, like I'm just never free
It seem like my whole life they wanted me to be something not me

[Verse 2]
Let's get it
Women they love it put nothing above it I'm married to this shit I could never covet
I know that I'm living this life I was given I've been made for this shit
Beautiful women I love 'em, I do
I could never put 'em over my crew
5 in the morning now she coming through
Hollywood hills yeah she's loving the view

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
I've seen more dark nights than Bruce Wayne
Been through it all but I overcame
I'm still the same ain't nothing change, wait
Wait now I got a little more change
Do the shit cause I feel like it
They thought about it I real lifed it
Ain't nobody got a deal like it
Drop the shit and they real like it goddamn yeah uh
Take a step back let me analyse, I'm the man yeah uh
I'm draped up and I'm dripped at and I'm staying here
Rattpack 'til my pulse flat it's the brain yeah
Shit hot, then I'm probably on it
Like a desktop, I'm iconic
It's Logic
