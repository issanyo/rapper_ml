[Hook: Logic]
Every time I think I gotta go, uh
Cause if you seek then you gotta know, uh
Bitches they only care 'bout the flow, uh
Come on you know how the story go, uh

[Verse 1: Logic]
This the shit that never runnin', they always pretendin'
I get condescending, ain't my word I'm bending
Just imagine like Lennon
That we livin' like long division, my vision is risen
Shout out my homie in prison, shit is deeper than an incision
On a lower level, word to the devil
I could feel the trouble inside
Tellin' me what to do, I never abide
Feel the vibe
The second we arrive, you know we know just how to do it
My style they can never renew it, I bet they know it!

[Hook: Logic & (King Chip)]
Every time I think I gotta go, uh
'Cause if you seek then you gotta know, uh
Bitches they only care 'bout the flow, uh
Come on, you know how the story go, uh (Uh)
Every time I think I gotta go, uh (What?)
'Cause if you seek then you gotta know, uh (What?)
Bitches they only care 'bout the flow, uh (What?)
Come on you know how the story go, uh (What?)

[Verse 2: King Chip]
She came with a couple of friends told them come on in
I was wonderin', do you need someone to fill you in?
On the reg nigga not givin' a fuck 'bout why you mad at me
I'm hittin' that pussy standin' up on the wall like ain't no gravity
King Chip is what? Good observation
He gon' keep living while you keep observatin'
Is that even a word? Nah but is you hatin'?
Language is the art so when I talk I'm creatin'
A whole new way to live, way to think, way to feel
Let them bitch ass niggas know they fuck with me they gon' get killed
They gon' run, put that on my son, nigga don't give no fuck
All a nigga know is bad luck, bad luck
Knowin' a nigga gettin' to these L's while I can doe
Working towards more happiness than I can handle
Light the candle, South Africa after sexin'
My doors open. we smokin', chillin', relaxin'

[Hook: Logic]
Every time I think I gotta go, uh
Cause if you seek then you gotta know, uh
Bitches they only care 'bout the flow, uh
Come on you know how the story go, uh (Uh)
Every time I think I gotta go, uh
Cause if you seek then you gotta know, uh
Bitches they only care 'bout the flow, uh
Come on you know how the story go, uh

[Verse 3: Logic]
I see through these motherfuckers like cat scans
And if they talkin' back, I just give them the backhand
Think I work for Apple the way I give 'em the Mac, man
Only partially ballin', motherfuckers is Pac-Man, God damn!
I'm just playin', don't pay attention to what I'm sayin'
Everything just a part of my plan
'Cause really I ain't shit, I'm just a man
Chilling in my city spending money like Diddy
Hundreds and fifty's I'm spittin' greedy
While you sittin' pretty, who fuckin with me?
First name Bobby, but I spit that crack like I was Whitney
Started as a hobby but who knew back then what this shit would get me?
And now they all up on the scrotum
The second I told 'em, these lyrics I wrote 'em
Acting like I owe'd em
Not a lot of people understand my words cause I encode'em
Now these bitches give me the top of the totem
Allow me to break it down, I feel like I'm breaking down
'Til I hit the mic cook up the shit that I'm making now
Kinda like Quentin Tarantino, these only built for cuban links
With Gambino's at the casino blowin' my nose with a C-note
Some people call me Robert cause I'm all about the Dinero
You talk a lot of shit that's why you sound like a culero
You fuckin' perro my lyricism es fatal pendejo
All up in my business while I'm just tryna get the queso
Life is about the peso, in English that means the money
And if your buzz is as big as mine then you'll get all the honeys like

[Hook: Logic]
Every time I think I gotta go, uh
'Cause if you seek then you gotta know, uh
Bitches they only care 'bout the flow, uh
Come on you know how the story go, uh (Uh)
Every time I think I gotta go, uh
'Cause if you seek then you gotta know, uh
Bitches they only care 'bout the flow, uh
Come on you know how the story go, uh
