[Chorus]
Oh my, my
Oh how the times have changed and I know why
Things will never be the same again
Things will never be the same
Never be the same
And oh, it's 'cause the world has changed
And oh, the world has changed
The world has changed

[Verse 1]
The person in the mirror will change eventually
The love of your life will change eventually
The children you have will change eventually
Everything in your world will change eventually
And you'll say

[Chorus]
Oh my, my
Oh how the times have changed and I know why
Things will never be the same again
Things will never be the same
Never be the same
And oh, it's 'cause the world has changed
And oh, the world has changed
The world has changed

[Verse 2]
Even in the darkest times
Just remember, everybody falls apart sometimes
Sometimes
Sometimes
Sometimes

[Outro]
And oh
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Ooh, ooh
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
