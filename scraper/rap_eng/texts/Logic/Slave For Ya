[Verse]
When I breathe I can feel you in my lungs
When you leave I can feel you on my tongue
One last kiss, cause it's just never enough
Baby, you been the one since the first month
When I'm walking in the street
When I sleepâ€”when I eat
You're the only one that I can see
But hey, what will we be?
Dumb question, cause we already know Chi
I love when we sitting in the grass
Tryna talk but it's harder when we laugh
And I love when we walk holding hands
So all the girls know that I'm only your man
And I love when you make me feel like the king
You could never understand all the happiness you bring
Baby, you're everything I need
I regret not seeing it at fifteen
I can feel you in my bones
I know you'll be there right now
And even when I'm grown
I'll always be a slave for ya
I'll ride or die baby
You know that I'll lay down in the grave wit' cha
I'll have everything made for ya
I'll be a maid for ya
I'm pretty sure that God had me made for ya
Cause I'm a slave for ya
And babygirl you're off the chain
On a love train heading down memory lane
Back in the days when we talked the nights away
But the next morning, we would regret it
But none of us said it
Baby, you got it all
The reason the Sun is hot and reason I had to fall
Chia, you could be my ballerina
Dancing on my stress 'til your toes break it apart
And I can feel the freedom
I hope to hold you close endlessly
You'll never leave my memory
The smell of you will always get to me
Cause you're everything I crave
You're the reason I'm brave when I'm afraid
And that's a lot to say as I slave for ya...
