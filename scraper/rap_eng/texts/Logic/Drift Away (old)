[Intro]
(Damian Lemar Hudson singing)

[Verse 1: Damian Lemar Hudson]
Do you hear my sound
It's blowing like away
I brease into your town
Taking my oxygen
You know you can't pretend
Your ears I apprehend

[Bridge: Damian Lemar Hudson]
Drift away I found
Drift away I'm bound
Drift away I found
Drift Away I'm bound
Drift away I found
Drift away I'm bound
Drift away I found
Drift Away I'm bound
Drift away I found
Drift Away I'm bound

[Hook: Logic]
Will I be remembered by the fans
For bringing them music they love while rocking in the stands
I guess it that really all depends
'Cause whatever they want, yeah we got it in demand
Will I be remembered by the fans
For bringing them music they love while rocking in the stands
I guess it really all depends
'Cause whatever they want, yeah we got it in demand
You see I got it all day
So will I drift away?
Or Am I here to stay?
You know I'm cool with either way

[Verse 2: Logic]
Alot of y'all is current must stop without a clue
So catch up to the flow even know we gon' rhyme through
When hearing up the other
That's worth to your mother
Will my lyrics pass down like R.I.P to grand-mother?
And will they be forgotten like your crack addicted brother?
This is matrimony
Logic, mastered the ceremony
As I conduct these fake rappers
I call it a assimphony
Now you all up on me
'Cause I keep it movie real
I see the bigger picture and hit ya with that switcher
Fuckin' with the voyager
Logic comming to get ya
So tell me will I shine? (Shine...)
Or die
And later be the fine within' rhymes
Will you remember me for who I am
Or will I fade away and be remembered how I was?
A kid with rap star potential
But no buzz
To infinity and beyond
That's the shit that I'm on
I'm hungry in this game
And every day is ramadan
This is Logic Vs.dlh
Get ready to give us the creddy
We keeping the aim steady murder like machete
Slicing like Freddy
Willing and ready to take over the game
But if I succeed, will they remember my name?
Never drift away, but I proclaim
I'm changing every day
No my heart nor stay the same
So will I be remembered?
So will I be remembered?

[Hook: Logic]
Will I be remembered by the fans
For bringing them music they love rocking in the stands
I guess it really all depends
'Cause whatever they want, yeah we got it in demand
Will I be remembered by the fans
For bringing them music they love rocking in the stands
I guess it really all depends
'Cause whatever they want, yeah we got it in demand
You see I got it all day
So will I drift away?
Or Am I here to stay?
You know I'm cool with either way
