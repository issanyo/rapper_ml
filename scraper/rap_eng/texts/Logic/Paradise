[Part 1]

[Intro]
Church, yeah
Now this that—
Yeah, yeah

[Verse 1: Logic]
Now this that SpottieOttieDopaliscious, hella vicious
I wonder where is this, hold up
Get the fuck out my business, show enough
We roll up then load up
Just a bastard born out of wedlock
Close to the Earth like a dreadlock
Got my sites on deadlock
Visions of my enemy in a headlock
Feel like I'm livin' in Bedrock, surrounded by rubble
Just a youngin' in trouble
Took a shot and then made it a double
Took a shot and then made it a double
This that food for thought, my school ain't taught me good
No ingredients in my hood
But a tablespoon of this baking soda
Gon' make it good, like it should
That's ignant isn't it, hold up wait
Now take a look at my pigment
Tell me again, we can never be kin
Based on the color of my skin
Matter of fact your lips ain't thin
That's a club I don't wanna be in
My DNA get done integrated
My God it's innovative
That's a million miles away from administrative
I fuckin' hate it, anyway—
Long ago, way back in the day in a place called West Deer Park
I was like 5, sit in my mama lap while she would drive
Police would knock on the door, I would hide
Then they would talk to me and I would lie
Hopin' I, don't die on this side of a .45
Then they would handcuff my mama and take her away
Over down on the driveway
Fast forward a couple of years and I'm bumpin' that Sade
Fast forward a couple of more and I'm bumpin' that "My Way"
By Sinatra, so high, so high, oh my, God damn
Now I'm a grown man, oh man
What the fuck done happened to the plan
I know, as soon as I write this I might just go crazy (crazy)
Anything but lazy, I can't sleep (why)
Cause if I do, there's another motherfucker
Wide awake on the creep tryna kill you and he will too
We livin' like civilized people, but far from equal
I hope I live a long life and get to see my sequel
My son, my seed watch 'em grow and then watch 'em lead
Let me proceed, bumpin' that Californication, by the Red Hot
Fuck around and then hit 'em with a red dot
Y'all better not me fuckin' with me
Who, him? Yeah, me, I be the God MC

[Hook 1: Jesse Boykins III]
Follow me to paradise
Follow, follow me
Follow me to paradise
Follow me to paradise
Follow, follow me
Follow me to paradise
