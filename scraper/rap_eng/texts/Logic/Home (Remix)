[Intro: Logic]
Yeah, uh, yeah

[Verse 1: Snoh Aalegra]
For a long time I've been gone
A wanderer with nowhere to go, babe
I spent too much time, I've been strong
Asunder, free to roam, baby

[Pre-Chorus: Snoh Aalegra]
I've been homeless, hopeless with no address
'Til my heart, you chose
Now I got a home, baby

[Chorus: Snoh Aalegra]
Out here in the world I'm not alone
As long as I got you, I've got a home
If you just don't let go so I don't feel the cold
As long as I got you, I've got a home, babe

[Verse 2: Snoh Aalegra]
These four walls, they can't hold me like you do
You already know, babe
And I'll just fit my life inside you
Taking you everywhere I go, babe, yeah

[Pre-Chorus: Snoh Aalegra]
'Cause I've been homeless, hopeless with no address
'Til my heart, you chose
Now I got a home

[Chorus: Snoh Aalegra]
Out here in the world I'm not alone
As long as I got you, I've got a home
If you just don't let go so I don't feel the cold
As long as I got you, I've got a home, babe

[Verse 3: Logic]
Yeah, uh, yeah
Ever since that moment I know that I know that you're the one
Gotta keep it deep in your mind, I promise the only one
Baby girl I need you, I breathe you, no I could never leave you
I just don't have it in my heart to deceive you
Wherever I go she go, wherever she goes, that's my home
I've been thinking about it
I'm making it rain for myself but i'm digging about it
Man, feeling so crowded, need to be alone
No, I need to be away from my phone
No, I am not in a positive zone
And that's the reason why you are my home
Need to be gone
Need to be getting it on
Need to be getting it on
Need to be driving
Need to be lovin' and vibin'
You're the reason I'm surviving
You're the reason I'm alive in this
You're the reason I'm alive in this
You're the reason I'm alive, you're the reason I survive

[Chorus: Snoh Aalegra & Logic]
Out here in the world I'm not alone
Yeah, you're the home I never knew, deeper than revenue
And as long as we're together, whatever, we're gonna be fine
I put it all on the line like my heart in this rhyme, it's like
If you just don't let go so I don't feel the cold
As long as I got you, I got a home

[Outro: Snoh Aalegra]
Let me know, me know, me know, me know I got a home, oh
