You know how we do it, homie gotta get it the free
Strictly off of the top, off the T.O.P
Yea I said it, never regret it, I gotta bring it back now
Half white, half black now
Already said it, I'm doing this

Goddamn, RattPack all day, this is how we do it yea
From here to the Bay, uh, about to hit the plane to L.A
Goddamn, yea I'm feeling hella good
Under Pressure in stores right now, number one on iTunes
Goddamn, motherfucker, "vrume vrume vrume"
About to get the car of my dreams, this is how we do it, me and my team
It's much more than a sixteen, but I'm kinda feeling it
Yea, cause I'm a rap fiend
Goddamn, I'm the man, I could give a damn
This is the plan

Gotta flow cause you already know this is how we do it
Hell yea, every, every show like that
