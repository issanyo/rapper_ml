[Prelude]
For making some of those extra special reed disks for your entertainment

[Logic: Intro]
You stupid dope
Yeah
Prest-o, manifest-o the best-o so let's go
The flow is subsequential
Watch me outline like a stencil
Talent undeveloped is like an unsharpened pencil
Whole lot of potential that needs some fine sharpening
Now watch me drop it
Finished product they finna cop it
Can't ever stop it
I'm OCD with this rap shit
Now let it hit

[Brial: Verse 1]
Aye yo
Me dope, literally
Feel no sympathy
Feel no empathy
Flow so ill, if I don't spit it's killing me
You got zero ability
I've got superhero agility
Spit, leave em open like availability
24/7 like warehouse utility
Currently the current like electricity
Step into the room, I e-ffect energy

[Logic: Verse 2]
Me and Brail ain't on the same page
We on the same brainwave
And murder fuckers that don't know how to behave
Literally
Smoke that ass like Hickory B
This hip-hop shit rock shit never stop it I spit for profit

[Brial: Verse 3]
Long, kisses goodnight for those who sleep on the mic
Supposed the, message inclosed— I was destined to blow like Jonny Depp
As Boston George
I'm dope but how much dope could the heart endure
Rap style galore and that's final like the four plus four, get you eight, Carnivore
Rap door
Jesus Christ was so nice each bar's like the rapture and I don't need a drug test to tell I'm a dope rapper

[Logic: Verse 4]
Bustin' your chromosomes, my name is Sir now where's my throne?
Homie I hold my own
Keep your system nervous like prednisone
Stand-off the static
Phony MCs I've done had it
When shit get dramatic
I am liable to bust some static
Lyrical addict
Rehabilitation I'm at it, yes the studio where I take care of all of my foes

Fucker... tah haaa

[Brial: Verse 5]
Most wanted, but one of the most competitive
Veteran sick no Excedrin medicine its evident I’m heaven sent
Who you think you better than
My rhymes gon’ sink out
My lyrics gon’ settle in
This is sink or swim business, I’m dog peddlin’
I got a purple heart in my art, bring the medal in

[Logic: Verse 6]
I'm bringing the medal in
I never do meddle in
Business that ain't mine intertwine like a thick grapevine
No way that AJ rhyme, with a style like mine
Now get it poppin'

[Brial]
Yeah
[Logic]
You feel me?
[Brial]
Of course, homie

[Logic: Verse 7]
Now get it poppin'
Ain't no way that we gon' be stoppin'
Bitches is droppin’ they panties antsy to come get the hop in

[Brial: Verse 8]
To be honest, my flow glow shine like new polish
Whatever you call it
I'm the new Christopher Wallace
Billboard says Logic and Brial additional artist
So you ain't Logic or Brial so you an additional artist
I deal with so much fire like I'm addicted to arson
Daily like Carson
Smoke it like a carton
Of cigarettes

[Logic and Brial: Outro]
Naw, just stop dog
[Brial]
What's up, man?
[Logic]
The jone is smooth, the jone is tight
[Brial]
Hah, okay
[Logic]
So we gon' keep going
[Brial]
Word, word
[Logic]
Psychological
[Brial]
Word, word
[Logic]
That's right, right?
[Brial]
That's right baby
You know in the whole nine right here
My man Logic holdin' it down
My man behind the behind the producing
You know throwing these uh– sick tracks together
Shoutout to the–my man in the UK, you know. I love the, you know, I just love the way this music thing goes…
