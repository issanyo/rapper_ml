[Verse 1: Big Lenbo]
'Til I'm on, you can save all the sentiment
I'm in the lab formulating with the elements
Out of touch, stay low like a pessimist
Ice cold for the purpose of the betterment
Staying focused, tryna disappear the deficit
Way bigger than the figures though it's relevant
Rappers on some sweet shit, caking but they delicate
I be cold, kill 'em all, box 'em like they  Entenmannâ€™s
Cold blooded temperament, gots no chill
Sniff pills, keep the strange day for real
Let her call me daddy if it give her a thrill
But I kick her out the caddy if she bringing her bills
Pimping on the side before they gave me a deal
Swerving with no navi in the Hollywood Hills
They want me to leak it badly, but it's just gonna spill

[Hook: Big Lenbo]
It's like that man, it's like that
It's like that man, it's like that
It's like that man, it's like that (Ice Cold)
(Y'all niggas know)
It's like that man, it's like that
It's like that man, it's like that
It's like that man, it's like that (Strange Days)
(Y'all niggas know)

[Verse 2: Big Lenbo]
I'm not your average emcee with your joe-shmo flow
Thought you knew about me, but now you bout to know
Creep up on the scene puttin' rappers on they toes
Shit that I compose Ice Cold take control
No bougie clothes banning Instagram hoes
Rookie of the year, Lenbo went pro
Satchel paid in the game if you didn't know
Strange days even so, find me in the zone
Or the Northwest taking rest chillin' on the (on the, on the)
Northwest taking rest chillin' on the low

[Hook: Big Lenbo & Logic]
It's like that man, it's like that (it's like that)
It's like that man, it's like that (it's like that)
It's like that man, it's like that (it's like that) (Ice Cold)
(it's like that)
It's like that man, it's like that (it's like that)
It's like that man, it's like that (it's like that)
It's like that man, it's like that (it's like that) (Strange Days)
(Ya'll niggas know)

[Verse 3: Logic]
Everybody know my shit is wack, Lenbo the best
It's how you irrelevant rappers feel put it to rest
Livin' on the need to get down but I digress
Young Sinatra on the track
Throw it back and nevertheless
Just smoke a little, chill, laid back you'll never stress
I was never really one to smoke, I must confess
When it comes to killing anxiety, no contest
And fuck
Ending this line with the same rhyme
Me and B-I-G L-N-B-O, we got the same mind
Same slang, Wu Tang
Killer Bee, fuck with me
All the way from the middle America to the (all the, all the, all the way from middle America) to the Philippines
Whats up, we in the cut, hit the indica
We don't give a fuck
What's the deal?
Keep it on the top
Early days in L.A. and we creepin' in the truck
Lenbo in the driver seat, now we on the Odessey
Red pill, Blue pill
Open up a hand to see
Skinny bitches and burgers a fat (nigga fantasy)
Made it out the basement
Yeah, we made it out the basement
If I could do it again my word to kin wouldn't erase it
A lot of hard times but we always seemed to face it
Got me thinking that industry is fucking basic
Blurred lines everywhere but my shit is Lasik

[Hook: Big Lenbo & Logic]
It's like that man, it's like that (it's like that)
It's like that man, it's like that (it's like that)
It's like that man, it's like that (it's like that) (Ice Cold)
(it's like that)
It's like that man, it's like that (it's like that)
It's like that man, it's like that (it's like that)
It's like that man, it's like that (it's like that) (Strange Days)
(Ya'll niggas know)

[Outro: Walter Malone]
Logic and Big Lenbo
This shit out of control
Watch them haters tip toe
Dropping shit so Ice Cold
