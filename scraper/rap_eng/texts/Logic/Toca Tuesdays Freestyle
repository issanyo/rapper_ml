[Verse 1]

They call me L-O-G-I-C up in NYC
Spittin' it off the top of the dome
Murkin' they chromosomes
Can you feel it
The second I inhale it
Never despair it we got it
Yes I been risen, hit em' real quick
Off the top, never written
Goddamn, can you feel it, said can you feel it

It's crazy running into fans shake your hand, shit
And on occasion runnin' into some stans
That'll do anything just to get their demo in your hands
I tell em it's all love, I wish you the best fam, and man
On the real, it's really hella crazy
This is how we do it, let me get it for the fans

Smoking in London while the snow fall
In another country so pardon me for the roll call
Damn, who would've thought the fan base was this immense
On the first fucking train to Paris so pardon my french
Shows sold out, fans in line even though it's cold out
Yeah, touring Europe getting swiss cheese
Many said I'd never attain it now I'm like, "bitch please, what up?"
Allow me to open up the verse with something so diverse
Now let the flow immerse, hold up; watch it disperse
Visions of Biggie, Big L and 2Pac just looking at me
From the gates of Heaven while the police booking at me
Open your mental while bitches give me brain with no dental
Y'all probably think I'm crazy for touching this instrumental
Shout out my cousin Ego, he know this shit's sentimental
Been doing this shit for my dogs, holding down the kennel
I hit my ex, check it, I hit my ex

Strictly off the top, never written
That is what we doing now
Gotta spit it off the top, like blao
L-O-G-I-C I'm reppin' MD to the fullest
Push us but never pull us we got it
Goddamn, can you feel it

Actin' like they know me
But they don't so y'all can blow me
Chilling with the homie Tony
Yes we got it off the top
The t-o-p I do it to the fullest
So let me keep it going
So let me keep it flowing
Get it get it, like that
