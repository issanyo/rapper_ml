[Intro]
Shout out Mos Def, all day

[Verse 1 : Logic]
See Imma strictly go into a different type of zone on this microphone
They call me L.O.G.I.C I'm here up in the BBC
I got to spit it with this free, it's strictly off the T.O.P
Y'all know the deal we always keep it real, that Rattpack
That's a fact, break a bitch's back
When I get it spit it like crack, doing 70 on this highway
On in front of this bus and bussin' my mind open
Hoping these zeros will keep me coping on the ground
Like coping no time to bring the dope and got this narco got me feeling lit
It's been like 3 months since I've been home
Feel like forever how long I've been gone
Goddamn it's hella crazy
This shit it never faze me, amaze me
The second I spit it I rip it ridiculous, hella crazy
Ripping and living and striving and killing and ripping
He know this deal, this is how we do it on the real
This that random thought like Black Thought, The Roots
Then that Mos Def, Tribe Called Quest, nevertheless
I'm spitting more never less
When I get it Goddamn, touching your bitch's breast, I insist
I spit it I get it I rip it, it's gotta be crazy
When I do, it never do amaze me
I'm repping L.A now, used to be on M.D
And this is how we do it from this free
From the bay, to the bay, I jumped across the pond
Gotta spit it, with this one like I'm Harry Potter
Hairy twatter, all up on these bitches
The second I spit it far from the riches
It's hella crazy this is random thought
I said it once, I said it twice like a pneumatic device
I bring these words, hella absurd sweetest spit at the curb
Goddamn it's hella crazy, no it don't amaze me when I spit this fire
Higher than a sire, my first name is Sir, S.I.R

You put yourself in for it because I couldn't see you could do this
I lot of rappers they come by, and they got their writtens ready
(I know, and sometimes they give you shit for it
Even when you do it off the top
Now it's crazy freestyling is like so different

But you're just having fun, I think that's a part of the art)
Alright you know what I'm going to do, yeah?
