[Verse]
See, I’m a motherfucking lyricist, bitches they fearing us
Back in the day they wasn't hearing this, now I’m the one who’s steering this
I’m self-driven, will he kill it? – That’s a lyrical given
New-School style but the 90’s is where my lyrics living
My flow is like another Earth, Second nature
I disintegrate ya’, migrate ya’, then light-saber decapitate ya’
In the beginning they said it was fabricated, as soon as the numbers escalated
But these fuckers just mad that I made it
More chains than when a slave traded, check it
I’m under MCs' skin like muscle tissue, what’s the issue?
If you talking shit, then I'ma hit you
Grab a pistol then whip you, then dip you in lava, ain’t no one ‘liver
Second I arrive, I murder it, no, you never heard of it
So sick, my lyrics I don’t spit – I regurgitate them
As listeners chronologically study my words verbatim
Assassinate em’, the second I raid them like five-0
We pull off the heist and flee to Cabo now
I mask emotions like a robbery, 'cause when it comes to matters of the heart
Women will clog your arteries
Visionary - V’s up – Rattpack
Young Sinatra, Maryland's what I'm reppin'
Conceal the flow behind the image like a murder weapon
