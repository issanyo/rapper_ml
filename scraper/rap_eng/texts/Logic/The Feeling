[Intro: John Lindahl]
Two, three, go!
Anybody tryna have a good time? (ohhh)
From the front to the back, anybody tryna have a good time? (ohhh)
In the middle, in the side, anybody tryna have a good time?
A good time

[Verse 1: John Lindahl]
Baby
Come on, show me what you know (ooh)
It's amazing
When you start to lose control (uh huh)
Turning the pages
Love is the key to free my soul (uh huh)
(wait a minute)
It's coming together
We been up in this fight for too long, so long

[Bridge: John Lindahl]
Give into the feeling
Give into insomnia
Whatever you're thinking, I want you to forget it all
Endless vibrations, they make you feel so good

[Hook: John Lindahl]
Because I would never fake it
The fear is taking over me now
Ooh yeah yeah, Ooh yeah yeah
My heart is always beating
Ain't nobody stopping us now
Ooh yeah yeah, Ooh yeah yeah

[Verse 2: John Lindahl]
Baby
It's gonna be something magical
Intimidation , ooh, don't know what's on the other side
When we struggle and we fight, everything's gon' be alright
Just come together
Because we've been up in this fight for too long, so long
(Bobby talk to 'em)

[Verse 3: Logic]
Uh, yeah
I just wanna have a good time
God damn, baby girl hella fine, looking divine
And I really don't know how I did it, but I made her mine
One time let me bring it back
Feel the vibe, everybody alive
Really wanna survive, fuck a 9 to 5
I'ma do it better
Get her wetter
She a go getter
Pen game, Ryan Tedder, like "What up, what up?"
Anybody hating on the boy, they can shut up
Imma keep it goin' like this now, keep it goin' like
I know you feelin' this, I'm killin' this, but never villainous in this
I'm tryna to make you understand I'm the man for you
When you walk up in the room, I'ma stand for you
Singing in the rain kind of love, let it rain from above
And when the push comes to shove, I'ma be there, be there

[Hook: John Lindahl]
Because I would never fake it
The fear is taking over me now
Ooh yeah yeah, Ooh yeah yeah
My heart is always beating
Ain't nobody stopping us now
Ooh yeah yeah, Ooh yeah yeah

[Hook: John Lindahl]
Because I would never fake it
The fear is taking over me now
Ooh yeah yeah, Ooh yeah yeah
My heart is always beating
Ain't nobody stopping us now
Ooh yeah yeah, Ooh yeah yeah
