[Logic]
Lyrically I murder you quicker than Lamborghini drive-bys
Who knew one man could handle more beef than Five Guys
Sharper than steak knives, that I used to break ties
West Deer Park, that's where I'm from, end of story
Where cats pack more MACs than Apple's inventory
Maryland on my back, never slack, get the glory
I'm a motherfucking lyricist bitches they fearing us
Back in the day, they wasn't hearing this
Now I'm the one who's steering this, I'm self-driven
Will he kill it? That's a lyrical given
New-School style, but the 90's is where my lyrics living
My flow is like another Earth, second nature
I'll disintegrate ya', migrate ya', then light-saber, decapitate ya'
In the beginning they said I was fabricated
As soon as the numbers escalated, but these fuckers just mad that I made it
More chains than when a slave's traded, check it
I'm under MC's skin, like muscle tissue, what's the issue?
If you talking shit then Imma hit you
Grab that pistol and whip you then dip you in lava, ain't no one 'liver
Second I arrive I murder it, I know you never heard of it
So sick, my lyrics I don't spit I regurgitate 'em
As listeners, chronologically study my words verbatim
Assassinate 'em, the second I raid 'em like five-O
We pull off the heist and flee to cabo, uh
I mask emotions like a robbery
Cause when it comes to matters of the heart women will clog your arteries
This reality, kill it and you're dead like a fatality
Haters wanna kill me I should put 'em on a salary and give 'em their own hotline to talk shit
Call it 1-8-0-0 Suck my Dick
Wu-Tang forever mothotherfucker what I'm reppin'
The second I step in the vicinity murder evil entities
Who pretend to be friends of me but I know they not
[?] that's what I got, catch me in the spot
Never getting caught, never getting shot
Know we love it one love [?]
Unless it's from the cops then out body drops ha!
Of course I'm speaking metaphorical
Prophesizing the future like the oracle
Flow is rethorical the shit's historical
But they don't understand me I'm staying now
I getting honeys wiser than Christopher Colombus
While the youth's listening to music that make them the dumbest
Kamasutra flow, motherfuckers already know
My position is on top, your position is fetal
Never vain like a needle 'less I'm on the mic damn right
Hand me the mic and I'm the cockiest ever [?] motherfucker that you've ever met
But after the set
I'm humble, ready to rumble no we never stumble cause we 'bout it
Before I dropped my last shit everybody doubted
Till it came out, spit the flame out, and got my name out
Cause I'm ripping it up in a way that ain't nobody heard of it
Totally original but you ain't heard a word of it
All you do is compare me to others cause you're scared of it
So every category that you put me in I murder it
Murder it brutally, who are you to me, what could you do to me
To make me stop telling people to follow their dreams
Cause in the world we livin' everything it ain't all as it seems
But, if I can make ain't no reason they can't do the same
So if you ain't happy then you're the one to blame
[?] persevere till these haters fearing your name
Life is a vicious game [?] both pleasure and pain
But you only get one shot so boy, you better aim
Rattpack, Wu-Tang, forever what I claim
