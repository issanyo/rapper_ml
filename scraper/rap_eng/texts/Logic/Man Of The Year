[Piano Intro]

[Verse 1]
I wonder what it feel like
To do that shit in real life
And now I know I got it
That's the reason No I.D. has signed me on the dotted
But it's still Visionary till the death of me
Yeah, I'm tryna make it but I gotta find the recipe
Greatest of all time, I want the world addressing me
At the hotel, these beautiful girls undressing me
I'm tryna stay focused, I guess that's the lord testing me
I knew as a child, that this was my destiny
They do it for the limelight
But I make sure my rhyme's right
Waiting till the time's right
Smiling at my mom's like
Smiling at my mom
Smiling at my momma
MoÃ«t what we sipping now
We was never tripping now
We on private jets, in other words, that means that we tripping now
'Cause they was over there, I was over here
They was too scared while I was facing my fears
I've always been driven, but they too scared to steer
That's why I compete with legends, motherfuck my peers

[Hook]
I'm the man of the year, man of the year
Man of the year, man of the year
Man of the year, man of the year

[Verse 2]
They said I couldn't do it
Back when I was broke going through it
Till I got a deal, now they talking 'bout "I knew it"
But you wasn't there in the beginning
Nowhere to be found when I was down
But you show up when I'm winning
Uh, left me to drown, now I'm swimming
I do it 'cause I love this shit
Fuck the money, and the women, and the-
And the whips with the rims still spinning
I been at it since the beginning
All these girls screaming "Logic"
But I wanna hear my real name
Come from the lips of a beautiful woman, that's real man
Y'all act like I'm Superman
But I can feel pain
I shoulda gone crazy, and yet I'm still sane
Love it when they sing to us
Been shining what's bling to us
Yeah, over here
It's only been a year
I was dirt broke, now I'm balling like a sphere

[Hook]
I'm the man of the year, man of the year
Man of the year, man of the year
Man of the year, man of the year

[Verse 3]
Now that I'm in the limelight
They hit me all the time like (Logic, you never call me!)
Shut the fuck up, ho
Let me get my mind right
'Cause this is for the fans
Who truly understand
Real all the time
All of y'all my fam
Shooting for the stars
And I ain't finna land
Giving everything I can
While they tell me I'm the man
Making music is the plan
Matter fact, you can call it plan B
'Cause I kill these rappers while they're in their infancy
And I be first to pop off -  infantry
Gotta keep 'em in line like symmetry
We all fam, same root, smokin' different tree
And all these people in the crowd sound like a symphony
Uh, to my ears
I love it when they cheer
On the road to success, these haters in my rear
I got nothing to fear
'Cause the whole team here
And everybody shouting (What they shouting?)

[Hook]
You the man of the year, man of the year
Man of the year, man of the year
Man of the year, man of the year
