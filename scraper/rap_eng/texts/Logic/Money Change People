[Verse 1]
For my real homies that hold me down
Thanks to y'all they can't hold me down
Seem like everybody know me now
Like I owe 'em something or they been around
Bitch I been the same, y'all know the name
Never let the fame effect the game
When you do that shit through
Give a fuck about what you been through

[Hook]
Money change people
That's right it change people, not me
Like the only people my money change is the people not around me
Seem like my phone going crazy
Like I'm just never free
It seem like my whole life they wanted me to be something not me
Let's get it

[Verse 2]
Women they love it, put nothing above it
I'm married to this shit, I never could covet
I know that I'm living this life I was given
I been made for this shit
Beautiful women I love 'em, I do
I can never put 'em over my crew
Five in the morning and she's coming through
Hollywood Hills said she's loving the view

[Hook]
Money change people
That's right it change people, not me
Like the only people my money change is the people not around me
Seem like my phone going crazy
Like I'm just never free
It seem like my whole life they wanted me to be something not me

[Verse 3]
I seen more dark nights than Bruce Wayne
Been through it all but I overcame
I'm still the same, ain't nothing changed
Wait wait now I got a little more change
Do the shit cause I feel like it
They thought about it, I real lifed it
Ain't nobody gotta deal like it
Drop the shit and they will like it
God damn yeah
Take a step back, let me analyze
I'm the man yeah
I'm draped up and I'm dripped out
And I'm staying here
RattPack til my pulse flat, it's the brand yeah
Shit hot then I'm probably on it like a desktop, I'm iconic
It's Logic
