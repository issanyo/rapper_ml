[Verse]
Shorty, she love it
The second I rub it
There's nothing above it
Less' we talking music
That's the only time I covet
Latina honey took me to the casa
I ain't lying, I killed the pussy like Mufasa
Never impostor, she light the blunt up like a Rasta
Put on her clothes, now we headed out to dinner, dinner eating Shrimp and Lobster
Unless I'm mobbing with the Rattpack, then we scarfing pasta
I prophesize the future like i'm Nostra-damus
Never cocky, I'm honest, spitting the bombest
At the party, swimming in the sea of women while they spin Ebonics
Murder the game at light speed like Sega Sonic
Look white but spit black cause' me mixed like a Gin and Tonic
Shorty, she love it thuggish
Of course that's hella' rugged
And now you know we blowin' up like Middle-Eastern luggage
Yeah, we live life and do it proper
From MD to NYC, whipping the Phantom to the Opera
