(Go) go, go, go, go, go and on the count of three
(Go) go, go, go, go, go and on the count of three
(Go) go, go, go, go, go, go
On the count of three everybody run back to your fantasy, now

[Verse 1]
Feel like I've been waiting fo ever, for ever ever?
Through any endeavour, whatever my hand on the lever ready to go
Ready to go, yeah ready to go, uh, ready to go, ready to
This the shit they never know
I've been dealing with (hey) suits and fans talking about I'm straying from my raw roots
Well what if I told you some the music you hearing is actually from years ago
I'm talking long ago
But it's funny how the public ain't perceiving a little
Rumors started and everyone wanna believe that I'd just leave it and go
Leave it and go, leave it and go, leave it and go
Bitch I've been a beast, I'm eating like 10-a-piece
Homie put your mind to ease, keep enemies on a leash
Shout out to the homie Common, I know I'm redoing your shit
But you was fucking with the album so I'm sure it ain't a problem
A bit under pressure, nothing can measure
But all these beautiful women around me's such a pleasure
Shout out to the RattPack
Y'all it's looking like September, I know it feel like forever but we all gon' get that together just
Go, go, go, go
I'm writing this record on the back of the tour bus
Seem like every year that pass man there's been more of us
Me, Lenny, C Dot and 6ix thought it was the four of us
And the homie QuESt, and the homie Jon Bellion
That's my morte fame, you know we gotta goin' on
On the roll with the fever yeah I'm still on the mic
Did a show, sick as hell, but I'm still alright
You know we on that Wu-Tang, resurrect it with the band
Screaming "money ain't a thang", Visionary be the gang
When I'm done with the verse just send it to Bobby so the mix great
And when it drops, get the Castro mixtape (If it ever drops... like shit!)
Goddamn, you know I feel it
All the fans want the album, but you know I've gotta kill it first
Hella come up with a muthafucking killer verse
Rest in peace, man I wish I had a Dilla verse

[Outro]
People say the same stuff about rap music
People are just like, “Oh rap music now, oh it sucks. It’s so bad. Rap music now sucks
Now back in the day that was good rap music
That was where the good rap music was at
That’s the good rap music”
No it’s not! Have you ever listened to rap back in the day?
It’s always some dude being like
“Well I went to the hat store today and I bought myself a hat. Ha-ha-haa”
Nigga, nigga I don’t want to hear your hat stories
So lame
