V's up
Check it out listen up

[Verse 1: Logic]
One day, I woke up, and said I'm 'bout do this for the rest of my life
No question is right
Waiting for the bus at a stop light looking at the cop right in front of my eyes
Living in a world of lies
Where the truth dies and hatred multiplies, mu-mu-mu-multiplies
I said I can't take it
I remember wondering if I would ever make it
But as I reminisce I realize it was all irrelevant, it's evident
I'm Getting money for the hell of it
Never fuck around until the flow celibate
Speaking for the people like a delegate and when the situation's delicate
I execute it with the proper etiquette
Everybody wanna get ahead of it no
I can't take the time to stop
It ain't all about the money so I'm headed to the top
But I'm still getting gwap never stop unless a body drop
Metaphorical motherfucker to get it in
While the whole world spin for the dividend
But I'm in another system
Everybody hate till he dead then they miss 'em
Why can't we relax and listen
Stop spending money on things that glisten
From the east coast, but we chillin it out Cali
Cause your boy got drive like valet
Poppin' bottles of that bubbly, Caillat
Leaving motherfuckers on their toes like ballet
White girls doing lines of white
And they be down to fuck if the time is right
Marry anybody if the diamonds right
And yeah we don’t give a fuck what they..
Bad bitches on they dick but I can't fade
Cause they in love with the fact that I'm getting paid
Make a motherfucker wanna roll up
Cracka hold up in a drop top, on the west coast
Shout out to my homies up in LA from the East Coast
G's Up Hoes down when we come around
V's up, mufucka from the underground
And I made it to the mainstream
With the same team
On another level but you on the same thing
Lyrical fiend and I flip it up with the same scheme
Rattpack till the casket
Flowin' no quicker then when the gas lit
When it comes to impeccable flow will leave em mastered
Getting money left and right I pancake
Got stacks like iHop can't fake
On the road to riches so there ain't no need to break
So common homie tell me what it is
Never in another brother biz
Up in West Deer Park listening to Wiz
Getting money from every direction
No question, living is a blessing
Rest in peace to the homies that ain't here today
Cause in the pack I ain't got nothing to fear today
Reppin MD, near DC, out VA, up NYC
Chillin in a whip like, like, like Visionary

[Verse 2: Logic]
And all these spanish women watching me like a novella
And even when we in the crib I still need an umbrella
Cause im getting her wetter than a letterman in the rain
We at the club hundreds and fifties I'm making it rain (Sike Nah)
All of y'all know I'm kidding like the rubber broke
Getting money and bitches but really that’s another note
And all these haters they can suck my dick
Cause honestly that's the only way you'll ever suck-ceed
Got what you need cause I sweat and I bleed
Did it all on my own didn't beg didn't plead
Everybody talk about logic, don't sell out
Bitch I had a deal for a year before it fell out
Doing shit that rappers never do you know I'm on that
So why don’t I start by telling you what was in my contract
Make the type of music that I want (Check)
Work with whoever the hell I want (check)
Keep it visionary to the death (yeah)
Cause I'm doing it for the music, not just to get a check
V's up, whaddup you know I'm on point
I be chilling with your bitch while she rollin up a joint
Making a killing for a living like a hitman
Rappers hear my new records and be like aw shit man!
Black Power, Black Card, White fist
Ain't no way a mixed brother didn’t write this
And everybody talking shit man, screw it
Cus if you can do it better than me then you do it !
Where we going, really there's no tellin'
Lyrical cocaine, narcotics is what I'm sellin'
God damn, got bars like a felon
And we getting C-notes like my homie Jon Bellion
Logic
