This song, to me, this was like the actual first song... I guess, that you could say with structure, you know like um, just verse, hook, bridge. It was much more than just a beautiful intro, and much more than just six minutes of raps, like the previous record, this was a full length song. This is, you know, "okay, we get it, the kid can rap, the kid can, you know, have fun, but let me hear him create something" and thats what I wanted to do on "I'm Gone." Funny enough, 6ix produced damn near the majority of the entire album himself, and we were in the studio and we had just finished, um, I think it was, uh, the intro, I think it was one of the last ones that we did actually, and on the ride home he was like "Man, I just want to get one more, just one more" and I was like "Hey, if you can do it..." And then the next day, you know, he made this beat and um, and I wrote to it and for me this is my inspiration. Me talking about my old inspiration. Maybe just money and women and cars, the cliche hip hop thing that I think a lot of people kind of get into hip hop for, just fun stuff, but kind of getting rid of that and going "I'm going to tell my story," finding the inspiration of wanting to just be myself, and let the world know who I am and just make.... music. So it sounds as though I'm talking about a woman, getting rid of my own "woman," and getting with my new "woman" - my new inspiration and leading into this album
