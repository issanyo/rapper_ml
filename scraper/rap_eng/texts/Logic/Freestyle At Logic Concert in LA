It's the type of records that these labels taking loans for
The type of fuel that got them talking up some folklore
So homie get that bag out my face
I'm a full blown genius, what the fuck I need coke for
And these labels sign wack shit cause of YouTube views
And then they albums just sound like true bad news
That's why I'm posted in the studio and [?] brought brews
I make a bunch of artist sad, they the Blue Man Group
I said this beard dumb long, hear me, got the Foo Man Chu
And dank green in the mountain, yeah I do that dew
I listen to opinions like "you so cute"
A&Rs give opinions, "who the fuck asked you?"
Ethiopian named Jordan, she my jump man boo
And Visionary got the soul, we the jump man crew
See my father control my bread like Bruh-Man do
Which means I'm jumping over taxes like a stuntman do
And shallow bitches be like "do me though"
I'm like I got no time, I got run back to the studio
I never been about that groupie flow
I made a bunch of whack rappers get subconscious about they doodie flow
You snoop around my iPhone
You'll find a slight idea that'll have your fucking mind blown
Raised by J Dilla, Mr. West, and Jay-Z
You fast-forward, I'm conversatin' with No I.D
I was nervous when him and me were speaking because all my tracks were gone
And it was for a record I wasn't fucking rapping on
I spit for Logic, he was like "yo Bellion, you nice."
After awhile I'm like "fuck it, you right."
They thinkin' that they special cause they hot on the mic
'til this kid gave'em pop, money bodies your life
I am fashion, samurais and assassins
Couldn't see me with glasses
Verses colder than snow like I'm overdosing in Aspen
Doing it just for practice
Then when you hear me rapping, you pray that I was a bastard
Because I'm sonnin' kids like I ain't have a father figure
I'll shake your hand cause I've never had a problem witcha
You just a pebble baby, ain't nobody rockin' witcha
I'll give you that Pusha T and put the fear of God up in you
