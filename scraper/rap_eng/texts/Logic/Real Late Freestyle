[Verse 1]
Check the verse gotta make it count
Won't speak on my bank account
So many commas I have to pause
And I can't afford to just waste the bars
I'm spitting this venom, strictly off the T.O.P
How we do it N.Y.C
L.O.G.I.C I'm repping M.D yes y'all know the deal
We keep it real, that's all the time
Hella sublime I represent, for the city
Can you feel me off he top
It's never written cause that shit is forbidden
I gotta spit it hella crazy, feeling feeling hella lazy
Cause I was out, at this listening party
Last night, shorties getting naughty
Goddamn, oh lordy I'm just having fun
I'm just, having a good time
Visionary paint the picture like pictionnary
I'm fucking your bitch, maybe missionary
Goddamn, just having a good time, spitting sublime
Can you feel it Rosenberg, homie, homie that's the word
I gotta get it like this
October 21 with the illest verse, disperse, I got it
Under Pressure
It's never lesser, and so is on this
Shout out to big Nas, Nasir Jones
Going through your headphones
This is how we spit it, this is how we do it all night
Late night let me get it
L.O.G.I.C we got it right yeah

[Verse 2]
Feel my energy, I ain't talking E-N-E-R-G-Y, I mean inner G
That's the shit they never see
But I own supremacy, number 1 I better be
Bitch, I said I bet I be
Take my kindness for weakness, trying to get the better of me
Tell me how is they gonna remember me
As the artist that concocted the perfect recipe
Or will they be addressing me, talking less of me
Just because I was different, just because I was doing what I love
And the fans they say they love you, but they push and they shove
Cause they want what they want how they want when they want it
I just gave them twenty songs, now they want another hundred
I just see it as a challenge, I could do it, bitch, I run it
Worldwide tours, type of shit I always wanted
While the rest of 'em just worry about bitches and getting blunted
Still that same motherfucker from that YS1
Only difference is I'm stronger and better from when I've begun
