[Verse 1]
Uh uh uh, yeah, V's up motherfucker what it is
Visionary takin' over the whole biz
All over your city like we in the blow biz
Never go Hollywood even though we in show biz
Baby girl, I just wanna give it to you like you never had it
When it comes to music I'm an addict
A killer, ain't none other iller for realler that's word to Dilla
Rest in peace the best with beats
And I'm 'bout to bring the heat like 5-O
Cutting records when I'm out in Cabo
Logic got more verses than the bible
I'm liable to murder anybody that pretend to be a contender
There's no better than us, the second we bust their guts, you'll trust but we get it in
Cutting records like a dividend
You can kill me but my music it will live again
Rattpack, six months on the track
GRVTY on the visual, so you know its a rap
I murder, bringing shit that you ain't never heard of
I'm goin' in raw no contraception
Red Dead Redemption, no need to mention
I'mma, murder the beat, homie word on the street, you a bitch
I plan to get rich cause my mixtape sound like an album
Your mixtape sound like shit
I don't give a damn, I am not cocky
I am Balboa even when the road is rocky
Chillin at MOCO, ya you know I gotta go
West Deer Park where I started ten years ago
Every time I see a hater they wanna get physical
Why? Cause when a girl see me we get physical
When it comes to women, I'm a Mac, you're a Dell
Pick up the mic and I shall prevail

[Chorus]
When the tide is high and the lights are low
You feel like there's nowhere to go
And when the stars align and the sky explodes
I'll be there, of this I know
And when the tide is high and the lights are low
You feel like there's nowhere to go
And when the stars align and the sky explodes
I'll be there, of this I know

[Outro]
And when the sky, is high, so high
And when the stars align and the sky explodes
I'll be there, right there, and I ain't goin' no where
And when the sky, is high, so high
And when the stars align and the sky explodes
