[Verse]
Uh, I'm ripping and living and striving
The killer, the ripper he calling
Will go with the flow and
You know he pursuing it, doing it, moving it, grooving it
Stopping it, rocking it, talking it, walking it
Flip it and rip it
That motherfucker is screwing' it
And everybody to go when
I buy it then break it then roll it
Then look at them
Smoke it then choke all of that later
Pack it, roll it, then lick it
Slicing MCs like Darth Vader
Decapitate a hater
The second I spit it 'cause I'm winning now
I gotta get it like that y'all
I gotta get it like that y'all
Lemme hear you say "Hell yeah!"
