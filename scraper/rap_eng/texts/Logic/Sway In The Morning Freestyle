Goddamn, Goddamn conversations with legends
Crazy how one day your idols can turn into your brethren
Bitches we severin, hit up my jewel and watch'em freezes
Breaking bread like I'm Jesus
Money ain't everything but somehow eases
Better believe us and then it leave us, the baby cryin'
Crack, cooking where my sister be frying soul food
Plus my other sister just went back to her old dude
He whippin' her ass, I kill him I kill him I motherfucking kill him
I said I really want to kill him but I can't
Cause if I do popo will claim I'm the villain but I ain't
See my vision from pictures I paint
Do you feel it like I feel it, I grip the mic and then kill it
Okay I'm gone, memories resurface from hella long in my past
Chilling sippin Sinatra from a flask, little Bobby
Just a youngin', skating was my hobby
Tryna stay out of trouble my homie in jail for robbing
Welfare, foodstamps and stealing from the store
Come home and see an eviction notice taped to my door
Couldn't take no more, momma on drugs, daddy M.I.A
What can I say?
I just wanted to be a kid and play
To this day, I pay homage to the gods, to the greats
Never stolen I'm from Maryland where they shoot you in the dark of the night
Like Christopher Nolan for talking out of your corner
Catch me rolling with the realest, lyricism the illest
My chain is the chillest sub zero
Far from a hero bitch I'm DeNiro in Goodfellas
If you're doing your bitch around me best bring an umbrella
Let me get it I spit it off the top ridiculus it's never like this
Can you feel it L-O-G-I-C I'm reppin M.D yes we on it Sway
How I gotta get it? All day, every day
Half white, half black goddamn I'm a mac
Can you feel it like that
Let me hit'em with the killer grunt
Always got a stunt then I get it with the sound effect
Never can neglect
Yeah I feel it yes I love it gotta get it
When I spit it up in N.Y.C the M.D is the realest, call me Logic
Yes you know the flow is so nostalgic at the 90's with this shit
That's off the top of the dome I'm reppin' V.M.G that's Visionary
And then IDJ that's Def Jam but you know we got the creative control
Hold up, let me bring it back and never slow it up we gotta do it goddamn homie we know
Shout out to the homie Gambino, get the C-Notes
This is how we do it can you feel it
It's so pathetoric, chillin' with my Indian homie Rhêtorík
A native American, this is how we do it come and stare again
Oh my god yes I can feel it goddamn
Hit you with the K chilling with my homie Slay
And these beautiful women I'm never swimming
I gotta ride with that, ride with her
One  hitta quitta never that
Once again, half white and half black
Reppin' M.D that's Maryland where I'm from I'm from the Burg, call it G
This is how we do it See, reppin' Gaithersburg Highschool
Never graduated but I'm not a fool
Feeling hella cool, feeling hella Breezy
This is how we do it can you geezy
I'm not even making sense so that's how you know it's off the top
Never drop, never got to stop I could get it
I could get it I flip it keep it going
Never knowing which direction I'm flowing
Goddamn yes I'm soarin' like I got it on the track
Matter fact bring it back, goddamn
Got it like that
Yes I love it, yes I does it yes I do it for the children like that
Wu-Tang, kill it bang, hit'em with the killa bee
Killer free, this is how we do it off the T.O.P it's me
The L-O-G-I-C I kick'em with the free it's Logic
