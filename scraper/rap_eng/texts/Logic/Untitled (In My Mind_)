[Part 1]

[Verse 1: Logic]
God damn, this shit is vicious
'Cause my main bitch in this world is really my mistress
Feeling like I knew this already, like I've been through this already
Yeah I'm ready to do this already
In my mind, yes I've done it, yes I run it
Keeping it 100, flow is crazy, shit is amazing
No it don't ever phase him
Yeah they taking shots but they never graze him

[Hook: Logic]
And If I open my mind, what I hope to find is real
Said if I open my mind, what I hope to find is real
And if I open my mind, what I hope to find is real
I said if I open my mind, what I hope to find is real
