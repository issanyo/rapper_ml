[Intro: Logic & Smokey Legendary]
You know what it's like
Tell 'em Logic
To wake up every day enslaved to something?
Your whole life changes
That you once didn't understand
Didn't comprehend
Didn't want
Now craving (now craving)
You become accustomed to this lifestyle
Addicted
Me? I live a life behind bars
With no parole
That's it, it's a life behind bars

[Chorus: Logic]
Incarceration
Livin' like a don, like a killa (incarceration)
Livin' like a G, ain't no one realer (incarceration)
Everything I got, that's what I'm givin' (incarceration)
A life behind these bars is how I'm living (incarceration)
Incarceration
Livin' like a don, like a killa (incarceration)
Livin' like a G, ain't no one realer (incarceration)
Everything I got, that's what I'm givin' (incarceration)
A life behind these bars is how I'm living

[Verse 1: Logic]
What it is, what you know?
Stack my paper, watch it grow
These bitches tryna test my game but I spit flame and flow zirconium
My team gettin' this money
Presidential suite with honeys, now it's on again
On the phone with a girl that wants to bone again
But I have not the time
Gotta get up in the lab, write this rhyme
Unkillable flow that define, a murderous record like mine
Please come correct my baby girl, you know all I do is grind
I said it from day one, they the ones that's gonna help me shine
I'm talkin' 'bout RattPack, you know the deal, we real all the time
We livin' Luxurious, haters are furious 'cause they life ain't like mine (Stillmatic)
Aren't you in a BMW bumpin' Stillmatic?
But it could be, would be, if you still had a little bit of sense to make dollars
Instead of chasing materialistic girls and driving Impalas
It's that OG mentality, while the whole crew burn tree like calories
Now what it is? What it do?
Best duck down if I aim at you
I'm gunning hard, safety off
Sight's on, and I'm poppin' off

[Chorus: Logic and Smokey]
Incarceration
Livin' like a don, like a killa (incarceration)
Livin' like a G, ain't no one realer (incarceration)
Everything I got, that's what I'm givin' (incarceration)
A life behind these bars is how I'm living (incarceration)
Livin' like a don, like a killa (incarceration)
Livin' like a G, ain't no one realer (incarceration)
Everything I got, that's what I'm givin' (incarceration)
A life behind these bars is how I'm living (incarceration)

[Post-Chorus: Smokey]
You had my mind wrapped up in your game (up in your game)
Had me thinking that I'm going insane (going insane)
All the mess that you put me through (I'm only through it baby)
Incarceration, karma's coming to you (coming for you)
Now you're sittin' here cryin' to me (cryin' to me)
You did me wrong, fuck your sympathy (no sympathy)
I can't go on believing your lyin' ass, you're lyin' as they cheated (you a liar, baby)
Dang it, girl, can't you see?
Break the chains, set me free

[Chorus: Logic and Smokey]
Incarceration
Livin' like a don, like a killa (incarceration)
Livin' like a G, ain't no one realer (incarceration)
Everything I got, that's what I'm givin' (incarceration)
A life behind these bars is how I'm living (incarceration)
Livin' like a don, like a killa (incarceration)
Livin' like a G, ain't no one realer (incarceration)
Everything I got, that's what I'm givin' (incarceration)
A life behind these bars is how I'm living (incarceration)

[Verse 2: Smokey]
And now you're messin' with my mind, it's incarceration
You gotta do the time, it's incarceration
Found you guilty, your soul is filthy, incarceration
And now you're messin' with my mind, it's incarceration
You gotta do the time, it's incarceration
Now that you're guilty, your soul is real filthy
Incarceration
Incarceration (Incarceration)
Incarceration (Incarceration)
Incarceration (Incarceration)
Incarceration (Incarceration)
Incarceration (Incarceration)
Incarceration (Incarceration)
Incarceration (Incarceration)
Incarceration (Incarceration)

[Break: Jason]
One day, you have your whole life in front of you
All your plans, your dreams, they're all laid out
Then one decision changes everything
The future you once knew is gone forever
You live in a shadow of that one wrong choice that you can never take back
Sixteen years to life, and your mind fades
Logic, Maliki, family for life

[Post-Chorus: Smokey]
You had my mind wrapped up in your game (up in your game)
Had me thinking that I'm going insane (going insane)
All the mess that you put me through
Incarceration, karma's coming to you (coming for you)
Now you're sittin' here cryin' to me (you're cryin' to me)
You did me wrong, fuck your sympathy (your sympathy)
I can't go on believing your lyin' ass, they cheated
Dang it, girl, can't you see?
Break the chains, set me free

[Outro: Smokey]
You had my mind wrapped up in your game (up in your game)
Had me thinking that I'm going insane (going insane)
All the mess that you put me through
Incarceration, karma's coming to you (Incarceration, baby)
