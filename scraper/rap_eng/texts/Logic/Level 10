[Intro]
Yeah!
You're trying to beat this game right now?

[Verse 1]
This is level 10, it's level 10 y'all
This is level 10, it's level 10 y'all
Gotta use your logic, the force
Gotta use your logic, the force to get pass
To make it to the end
Make it to the end, don't pretend
Come on be my friend
Tell me how you're feeling the second I'll do it
I've been dealing on that real ish
I've been dealing on that real ish, uhh
I'm the boss of all bosses
Not one to floss but I need it
This is how we do it I gotta feel it, right now
I can feel it from the whole style
'Bout to kill this whole motherfucking shit freestyle
Up the top of the dome
Send them all home
If you can't beat this level that's word to the devil
What you gonna do?
I'm pullin' strings like Geppetto, can you feel me now?
'Cause I wanna be a real boy
Can you beat this level? I don't know (let me hear that)
I'm gonna make it, yeah, I got the force
I wish Kan was Obi
Louis Vuitton dot Kenobi
That would make me dot D
Luke Skywalker 'cause I'm a fly talker, not a death star
But they ain't ready for that, that's from the demos right there
That's that Damian Lamar Hudson first real project out the game
Elysium, what?
See, that's why you gotta wait
That's why you're so happy
You're at level 10 right now
Mess around, giving you all freestyles, check it
Uh, I've been working all night
[inaudible]
What you're talking about?
You can't give 'em that
I've been grinding, working really hard
But it's gonna be a while
'Cause I'm taking my time, feel the style
Can you understand?
I gotta get it, that's my man
L-O-G-I-C, I'm reppin' MD to the fullest
They push us but never pull us
And we out in LA, yeah
I've been chillin' on my compund
That house going down
Can you feel the smile? Nah, nah, never frown
I gotta keep it real good when you come around
Tell me how you feeling right now
I'm a villain right now
'Cause I'm the boss of all bosses, said I'm the boss
Can you make it to Elysium? I don't know
All you other motherfuckers wack as hell
You're wack as hell!
Level 10, woo!
Level 10, yeah yeah
And if you hear me rapping still it means you ain't make it yet
Why the hell you ain't beat this level?
You ain't good enough or something?
You suck! You suck at playing video games!
You're just a lame but I'm not the same
