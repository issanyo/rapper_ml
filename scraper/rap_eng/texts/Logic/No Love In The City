[Verse 1]
Uh, what the fuck am I on
Homie what's the murder over an iPhone?
Broad daylight, shocked in the pawn
I was just with this nigga like 7 days ago
Caught him at the mall
Discussing advance to be on circumstances abroad
It's a cold world in the hottest city around
Niggas come from all around to get a glimpse of this town
It's crazy, paradise is a paradox
The majority of us struggle affording a pair of socks
My nigga Yoshi had a daughter coming slinging dope on the side
Working at the barber shop, was only trying to survive
Shot over nonsense, 'bout to have a daughter for the first
Was paralyzed from the waist down a week before the birth
My Lord, good kid mad city way before Kendrick
Probably why I got into music
Niggas thought I was stupid
Them same niggas lost in their second childhood
Having babies just because
Swear I never get caught up marrying pussy my nigga no matter how good
I got plans, but lately the city's lack of support is rubbing me in the worst way
The chip on my shoulder is meta-morphed to an earthquake
The same poisonous joy and my people be shit that they attracted to
Twitter thugs brag about how they carry a mac or two
Turn around, prophecy fulfilled
Same niggas you murder will only end up getting killed
No preachin', screachin'
I stay in the studio on the weekends
Dreamin', to make it out alive living decent
South Florida's where my heart at
This is where I start at
A lot of niggas doubting, I ain't really into call backs
Palm trees, feeling the breeze, beautiful seas
Can't forget about the women who make it lovely to see, so pretty
But under it all it get's gritty
Caught up in a cycle, I swear it's no love in the city

[Hook] (x4)
No love in the city
(No love)
No love in the city
No love in the city

[Skit 1]
Forget this nigga he must be crazy
Know how I do it
(No love, no love, no love, no love)

[Skit 2]
A lot of these murders that's occurring, don't really be intent for the people that's probably getting killed, simply saying it might be meant for somebody else. Or they just shooting just trying to make noise and whoever they hit they hit, you know, just randomly doing stuff. It ain't no love in the heart of this city right here. No it's just, it's just open season, ocean miles, you know

[Verse 2]
Uh, we used to rap together back in high school
Battle for respect, I hadn't seen you since I dropped out
Years later reconnected
This city's the worst, I'm tryna do more than what's expected
It's what you told me
"Why they had to take your life away?"
What makes me shiver is we called you trigger
Feels like your fate was early delivered
My condolences were sent with love
I pray you found the peace you needed from these gates above
Meanwhile it's getting worse, my cousin [?] just got murked
Over some girl who  set him up
My mother cried til her pupils were running dry
It's do or die
I feel the pressure setting
Never thought desperation would ever be this prevalent
I hope you know we miss you
I put you in these verses
Carry on your name and hope your dream can live through mine since our visions one and the same
Steady working since the slaying
I was plotting a couple things
But sometimes, this life will force you to change
Yoshi I'm glad you survived
When [?] told me you got shot up, I was devastated
Just had a conversation 'bout you leaving selling dope, and sticking to a 9-5 man
You wanted more for your daughter man
Looking in your eyes I know you meant it
All you ever saw was a way to provide
I'm just glad you're alive
Conscious agreed that even though your paralyzed, I kept you in my prayers
Further convinced me, shit is shifty
Better leave while I can man
I swear man it's no love in the city

[Interlude] (x4)
And this is all I know
No love

[Hook 2]
No, no, when everything is not alright
And even when I'm positive it's hard to see the light
I pray my spirit brightens up before my soul takes flight
I've been searching for myself, please  God don't let me lose this fight
Tonight, tonight, tonight

[Skit 3]
People say, you have to have a lot of passion for what you're doing. And it's totally true, and the reason is because it's so hard, that if you don't any rational person would give up. It's really hard, and you have to do it over a sustained period of time. So if you don't love it, if you're not having fun doing it, you don't really love it,  you're gonna give up
