[Verse 1: Tyler Thomas]
L.A. to the M.D
Couple young motherfuckers
Taking niggas and turning them into samplate
I don't really need nothing but some Netflix
And some good head from one of my future exes
Am I sexist, cause I got a bad bitch checklist
Really, really ain't my fault cause the social media feeding my urge to splurge
And she like my pics so she want the dick
Got hoes, got hoes, got hoes, for real
Not Manti Te'o, all my hoes is real
Young top from the side where them niggas get live
And them hoes wanna roll like them clothes on fire
Oh my, oh my, oh my life, if I don't make it I'll die twice
She cold-blooded like Twilight
I think she know she my type
I'mma get off on everything, like I'm perverted
Make these niggas shake like we just met in person
And if you goin hate me then that mean I'm worth it
And if you could judge me then that mean I'm perfect
You feel it? Got them hook, let me reel in
Fucked up on the ceiling, that's how I'm feeling
She try out like prettylips, getting brain while I peel it, tight

[Hook: Tyler Thomas]
Fuck y'all niggas, I got this
I came here with my clique
This here sound like mosh pit
And your bitch be on my dick
Roll up nigga, I got this
Pour up nigga, I got this
Fuck y'all niggas, I got this
I came here with my clique
This here sound like mosh pit
And your bitch be on my dick
Roll up nigga, I got this
Pour up nigga, I got this

[Verse 2: Logic]
One time for your motherfucking mind
When I get it I rip it up and every one of a kind
Heat when I rhyme
Never heard of it but I murder the beat when I rhyme
I better take it to another level, know I never settle, shit
Flow incredible, instrumental is edible
Talk a lot of game but this shit ain't credible
What's good, let me live it up, hit it up
V's up, got your shawty in the crib with her knees up
Ease up, let me bring it down
You the thing now, who the king now
Fuck around and finally got a little bit of bling now
But the money ain't a thing now
Yeah I know the shit sting now
Rattpack till my pulse flat
Take a look at my direction if you wonder where the boss at
Real talk, no false rap

[Hook: Tyler Thomas]
Fuck y'all niggas, I got this
I came here with my clique
This here sound like mosh pit
And your bitch be on my dick
Roll up nigga, I got this
Pour up nigga, I got this
Fuck y'all niggas, I got this
I came here with my clique
This here sound like mosh pit
And your bitch be on my dick
Roll up nigga, I got this
Pour up nigga, I got this

[Verse 3: Vic Mensa]
Somebody tell Miley Cyrus I’m tryna get a flight to her private island
And privately let her cosign my privates
And dine in her pussy 'til I get the 'itis
Pride of a lion the size of Goliath
Let one fly in the iris
I was was juking in the Porsche see if she can get Taj Mowry to let me drive with his license
Pitchfork probably won’t put me on their playlist I guess I’m not an A-list
To an elitist for my latest allegations but more riddled with scandals than Ronald Reagans
Who could appeal to the rockers and the Ragers gorillas in their cages?
Ape shit up in the mosh pit throwin them a set
Save money [?] innanet

[Hook: Tyler Thomas]
Fuck y'all niggas, I got this
I came here with my clique
This here sound like mosh pit
And your bitch be on my dick
Roll up nigga, I got this
Pour up nigga, I got this
Fuck y'all niggas, I got this
I came here with my clique
This here sound like mosh pit
And your bitch be on my dick
Roll up nigga, I got this
Pour up nigga, I got this
