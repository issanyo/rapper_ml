[Chorus: Rag'N'Bone Man]
We're broken people now
We're burning out
So cold and bleeding now, now, now
Gonna let you down
We're broken people now
We're broken people now

[Verse 1: Logic]
Tell me I won't ever be nothin', ain't that somethin'?
I've risen from the bottom
I got 'em eyes on the prize and inside 'em
Damn right I overcame, y'all know the name
We similar but never been the same
Everybody, yeah they know the name
Right now, we'll make it some how
We'll make it some way
Yeah you know we gon' get it today like
I'm all on my own now
I won't ever let you down
Won't let you down down down

[Bridge: Logic]
Yes I've been through it
They know I do it for the people
I'm fighting so we be equal
For my son and my sequel
And anybody who listenin'
In they system like venom
I get in 'em and spread visciously
This is me

[Chorus: Rag'N'Bone Man]
We're broken people now
We're burning out
So cold and bleeding now, now, now
Gonna let you down

[Verse 2: Logic]
We back at it
Young Logic, the rap addict
Giving it every part of myself on the real you would think that I'd be asthmatic
Allergic to your bullshit, yeah that's right I done had it
Real all the time, if you rep it get it tatted right now
This right here a vibe right now
I am too alive right now

Come on feel the vibe right now
Feel the vibe

Feel the, feel the, feel, feel the, feel the vibe

[Bridge: Logic]
Yes I've been through it
They know I do it for the people

For my son and my sequel
And anybody who listenin'
In they system like venom
I get in 'em and spread viciously
This is me

[Chorus: Rag'N'Bone Man]
We're broken people now
We're burning out
So cold and bleeding now, now, now
Gonna let you down

[Verse 3: Rag'N'Bone Man]
Broken we ain't beaten
There's no glory in defeat
We won't fall into the cracks between our streets
We're broken people now
We're broken people now

[Chorus: Rag'N'Bone Man]
We're broken people now
We're burning out
So cold and bleeding now, now, now
Gonna let you down
We're broken people now
