I administer sinister verses
Ain't no father to my style, bitch I birthed this
The menace is like Dennis
From Maryland to Venice
Like a chemist in a lab
Ha, my shit is complex and y'all the tenant
Ey yo who's arm is this ?
I guess Slim cut it off at the pharmacist
We murderin' MCs and then flee to wherever the Bahamas is
I blew up, So that's to let y'all know who the Bombest is
Cause I can see the future like my glasses Nostradamus's
Damn these rappers and they feelings
Like an orthodontist
It's probably cause my skin is white
Come on, be more than honest
I signed a deal with Def Jam
Cause I'm the man
You motherfuckers are sorta's and kinda's

(2x)
Yeah my city behind this
I know that you see that I'm murdering synonyms all up in them when I rhyme this
My flow is impeccable, hella unwreckable
Knowing nobody else honest

Now let me slow it down
So you ignorant people hear me
Even my favorite MC's won't get near me cause they fear me
Revere me, no disrespect. I mean that shit sincerely
I am merely the 2nd Renaissance to the fullest
It's all love from up above
Keep a gat in the glove just in case
Introduce you to Christ like Mase, sike nah!
All of you know that Logic keep the peace
But my brothers keep a piece in the streets, You got it? Capisce?
See that's a life I never wanted but I grew up in
And did a lot of dumb shit I'd never do again, What!
