[Hook: Juicy J]
Nigga wonder why
Like where I been
I ain't fuckin wit' you
Real niggas don't talk, about the dirt they did
I ain't fuckin wit' you
We used to be homies
I ain't fuckin wit' you
Money look good on me don't it?
I ain't fuckin wit' you
I ain't fuckin wit' you
I ain't fuckin wit' you
I ain't fuckin wit' you
I ain't fuckin wit' you
I ain't fuckin wit' you
Hell nah, I ain't fuckin wit' you
I ain't fuckin wit' you
I ain't fuckin wit' you

[Verse 1 : Juicy J]
There's certain niggas I don't fuck wit
There's certain niggas I don't fuck wit
Cause I go hard, and I ain't got time anymore
To waste all my goddamn floss
Seems every nigga wants me to fall
Oh well, landing on my car
Forgiato wheel let's keep it real
20 years in the game, still makin mills
I thought everybody liked it
Fuck nigga don't try me
Or end up in a situation you ain't gettin out of
Let me demonstrate a do-do-do-do-do, a hundred rounds
Fight night, yo life, outline
There's certains niggas I won't fuck with
There's certains niggas I won't fuck with
Like you, you, you, him, and that nigga
I don't fuck with y'all niggas
I'm too busy countin up until I see a hundred milly
Good riddance, my fingers itchy

[Verse 2: Logic]
Hell nah, I ain't fuckin' wit it
Actin like you bout it undercover wit it
I been workin' like a fiend, nah mean right?
I ain't fuckin' wit it if it don't seem right
Only time I be about it is if the cream right
Motherfuckers wanna gas like a green light
Till that shit pop off and they out of sight
Ain't no wonder why they never really bout it right
Stay up out my business I've been with this
Can I get a witness fuck around and end up on they hit list?
Oh, I ain't fuckin' with it though
Mind on my money, give a fuck about a hoe
Money like mine, only come, never go
(When you finna fall off?) Never though
Bring that shit back like we've been there before
Like you got it for low, like you got it like woah
Handle my business, I'm in this, I'm ready, I'm steady
This life is the only I know
Fuck about another man talk about another man money
Get the fuck from me
Logic the realest, I don’t give a fuck if you hate this or feel this
As long as you feelin' this dick
Frontin’ in front of my eyes that shit
Be makin' me sick

[Interlude: Juicy J]
Niggas be too fake man

[Verse 3: Juicy J]
Getting a blowjob in an old-school Lamborghini Countach
I ain't kick it with no niggas I ain't beefing with no niggas
I'm just tryna get my pocket on Oprah
These niggas bitches got my name in they mouth like Botox
Meanwhile I've been on my own shit
Sitting on my throne getting bent like a crowbar
You gotta be about your money
Never let another motherfucker count your money
The niggas in your circle is not your homies
If they don't fuck with you without your money
There's certain niggas I won't fuck with
Thirsty ass niggas on the internet keep me off your timeline
Fifty niggas waiting at your door-step
Gotta watch your homies can't trust them all
They get your ass killed for that new car
Niggas they hate, never met a nigga who was motivated
Twenty million later and I'm still waiting
Thirty-Six Mafia inspired you niggas
Six niggas from the mud still fly on you niggas
Real niggas respect real niggas
I can't give a fuck about the realest nigga
Nigga wonder why?
