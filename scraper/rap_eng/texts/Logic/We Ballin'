[Verse 1]
Laced up face up about to get it right
We ain't giving up the W without a fight
What you know about Friday Night lights
With an eagle so we about to take flight
Only one goal, never lose sight
Step on the court, we ignite
All the fans in the stands that are here tonight
To watch us when rocking the purple and white
Gonzaga is connected, you know we stay with net
And as for Nate Britts' plays, his J's stay wet
We got pros and they ain't even in college yet
What we think of the competition they ain't even a threat

[Hook]
We ballin, ballin, ballin, ballin
We ballin and we ain't gon stop
Gonzaga, Gonzaga, keep it one hunnid, hunnid, we run it
Gonzaga, keep it one hunnid, homie you know we run it
We ballin, ballin, ballin, ballin
We ballin and we ain't gon stop
Gonzaga, Gonzaga, keep it one hunnid, hunnid, we run it
Gonzaga, keep it one hunnid, homie you know we run it

[Verse 2]
All day, all night yeah we get it in
So there ain't no way that we giving in
Do it for the love not for the dividend
Cause we all got passion and discipline
When we in the paint, we mob 'em
Big ben, he swats 'em
Kris Jenkins is a problem
Just ask Snoop we dog 'em
You know we the center of attention
5 time champs not to mention
Winning games in every dimension
Breakin' ankles till we bench 'em
Jay Jones used to replenish 'em
Now he take score while we diminish 'em
Colleague in my league be dissin him
Dj and O we finish 'em

[Hook]
We ballin, ballin, ballin, ballin
We ballin and we ain't gon stop
Gonzaga, Gonzaga, keep it one hunnid, hunnid, we run it
Gonzaga, keep it one hunnid, homie you know we run it
We ballin, ballin, ballin, ballin
We ballin and we ain't gon stop
Gonzaga, Gonzaga, keep it one hunnid, hunnid, we run it
Gonzaga, keep it one hunnid, homie you know we run it

[Verse 3]
See this is basketball, half of y'all
Don't even know how to pass the ball
But I master y'all with these lyrics
Step to the mic and I know that you fear it
This is my dream, me and this team
Can't relate homie you know what I mean
Cause I got passion, they got heart
We were destined from the start
To rip it apart, never depart
Quickly climbing up the charts
So we gon' last, watch us dash
Whip the competition's ass

[Hook]
We ballin, ballin, ballin, ballin
We ballin and we ain't gon stop
Gonzaga, Gonzaga, keep it one hunnid, hunnid, we run it
Gonzaga, keep it one hunnid, homie you know we run it
We ballin, ballin, ballin, ballin
We ballin and we ain't gon stop
Gonzaga, Gonzaga, keep it one hunnid, hunnid, we run it
Gonzaga, keep it one hunnid, homie you know we run it
