[Intro]
I don't want any bologna, magic tricks, or psychological mumbo jumbo

In psychological terms

[Verse 1: Logic]
Never stopping it, continuously dropping it
And if you a chicken I grab the heat and start cocking it
And cowardice a thousand deaths
So only one time is how many times that imma' take my last breath
Feel my flow like you blind like you blind I'm not deaf
And if you do me foul, imma' call you out like a ref'
I love the way the snare hit and the drum kick like a fetus
All we need now is some punch lines to complete this
I sewed the lines I ripped let me read this
I sewed the lines I ripped let me read this
I'm wellaware
Homie I'm wella-wellaware
Said I'm wellaware
Homie I'm-Homie I'm wellaware

[Dialogue: Logic]
I am well aware of the path that I have chosen in the hip-hop community
And I am also well aware that if I keep up with myself at the pace I'm going, beautiful things can happen

[Hook: Logic]
I'm wellaware, well well where I'm going
Yes I'm wellaware, well well what I'm doing
Yes I'm wellaware, well well who I am
Yes I'm wellaware, wellaware that I'm the man
Said I'm wellaware, well well where I'm going
Yes I'm wellaware, well well what I'm doing
Yes I'm wellaware, well well who I am
Yes I'm wellaware, wellaware that I'm the man

[Verse 2: Logic]
The peacekeepers hit me up so you know I had to rock it for 'em
Wellaware hit me up inside to rap for him
He's in the U.K
I'm in the U.S.A
But that don't matter we collaboratin' anyway
I'm wellaware that rhyming is my affair
I'm on some wellaware that I spit shit you wouldn't dare
And guarantee a rise from an underground lair
Said I'm wellaware
My odds is a million to one
But I get it done
And while I'm mad I might have some fun
Yes I'm wellaware
That the people support my music
And I'm wellaware
That when haters listen they lose it
Allow me to intensify the situation
I'm an original artist but most of these fakers is tracing
Now watch me get in the rack with the track and smack back
I can't mess with stuff that just don't mix
Like rappers that be spittin' 'bout nothing but stupid hits
Fuck around and I break you down to the nucleus
It's Psychological well aware that we in the mix
Generate killer hits while the snare break you to bits
You probably think he sampled Nike with them fresh kicks
Punch lines like that got bitches on my dick
It's punch lines like that got bitches on my
Yo it's punch lines like that got bitches on my dick
Sorry I'm kind of sick

[Dialogue: Big Lenbo]
This music
I just feel this music
This music you know comes from the heart
It's creative
It's really inspiring to me

[Hook]
Said I'm wellaware, well well where I'm going
Yes I'm wellaware, well well what I'm doing
Yes I'm wellaware, well well who I am
Yes I'm wellaware, wellaware that I'm the man

[Dialogue: Logic]
Well I mean
Definitely first and foremost you know I just wanna' give a shoutout to the producer of this track
Cause without him you know this whole concept wouldn't have really been done
You know I wouldn't have thought about it
It wouldn't have came to me so definitely you know thank-thank you though for letting me hear this shit and put it together and just-and just think about it you know what I mean
And it's such a good way to produce yourself and it was a good concept you know so I really enjoyed it man
We gonna' keep giving it to 'em

[Hook]
I'm wellaware, well well where I'm going
Yes I'm wellaware, well well what I'm doing
Yes I'm wellaware, well well who I am
Yes I'm wellaware, wellaware that I'm the man
Said I'm wellaware, well well where I'm going
Yes I'm wellaware, well well what I'm doing
Yes I'm wellaware, well well who I am
Yes I'm wellaware, wellaware that I'm the man
