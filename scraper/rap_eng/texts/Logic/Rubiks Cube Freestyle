[Logic]
Yo, this is what we do
Nah, nah, give me the next one, give me the next one, hold up
[Big Boy]
What about this one?
[Logic]
Yeah, uh, check check, oh yeah, see i like this BPM. Here we go, you ready?
[Big Boy]
Uh-huh
[Logic]
Ok, here we go, check it
[Verse 1: Logic]
Iḿ bout to spit the vibe
This is how we do it whether its that new or that tribe
We always gotta keep it alive
You know my
Vision is hella crazy
The flow is never lazy
See, I don’t even know what Im saying
Im just vacaying in Barbados
The second i get its crazy ’cause she ’Jamaican me crazy’
I don’t know, I’m just spitting this rhyme
I gotta spit it on time
The second I do it strictly come off my mind
They say they know the deal
Always keep it real
And yes, I get it like that
This is how we do, I got my first tat
¨Happy Wife, Happy Life¨
Not a flow is never trife
I gotta, get it like this, its hella crazy
The flow is never lazy
And it doesnt even make sense, it doesnt even matter
Im just spittin´
That random thought
It can't be taught
This is how we do it
Speaking of thots, i can't fade these hoes
Where ya´ll been?
Where ya´ll going?
This is how we do it
I don’t even know what Im saying
I ain’t knowing, Im just keeping this
I just got this Rubik’s Cube, it’s got the lube and pars on that, we all on that
And this is how we do it
I spit these rhymes, its kinda crazy
[Dialogue]
Oh no, and ya’ll done messed this Rubik’s Cube up
[laughter]
See hold up, hold up
Ya’ll messed it up
So I gotta flip this around, take it out, put it back in
[Verse 1: Logic continued]
Now I do the algorithm real slick, real smooth
This is how we do it, like a criminal
Flow so medicinal
My stuff is heavily eradicated, never eradicated
They evacuated the second I arrived on the scene
I spit it hella clean, spit it hella mean
Thought I had it for a second but I didn’t
Gotta bring it back
This is like, it’s really crazy when you spit it like this
[Dialogue]
Oh my God! Ya’ll really messed it up
Ya’ll messed it up, ya’ll messed it up
I gotta bring it back, ya’ll was flipping it too hard with your fingers
I’m lingin, I’m lingering
I got it, I’m singing
I’m bringing them in
And this is how we do it, let me begin
[Dialogue]
I would’ve solved it faster if ya’ll wouldn’t have messed it up
[Verse 1]
But it’s all good we gotta keep it going
Shoutout to Kurupt
That West Coaster
The holy, the one and only, the grail
Spit the second I get it, and I prevail, the scene
[Dialogue]
Oh!
(Big Boy)
And he PREVAILS, ladies and gentlemen! There it is right there! Logic, Rubik’s Cube Freestyle!
Never done ladies and gentlemen!
[Verse 2: Logic]
Ok, I’m ’bout to go again, my flow again
My eyes closed
And this is how we do it when we spit it, do it for the pros
They think they know, but i don’t even think they truly understand
I’m a miraculous man
And this is how we get it, uh
I mix it up, I get it up, I keep my eyes closed
On that second that I got it, these hoes on ’em
I don’t even know just what I’m saying
I ain’t even playing
Mayday, tell me, I gotta get it right, get it tight
[Dialogue]
Oh!
(Big Boy)
We got Logic up in here, ladies and gentlemen!
It is definitely going down here
BIG BOY!
