[Hook] (X2)
Lemme break it down
Lemme break it down
Break it down so you all feel me
Oh lemme break it down
Break it down
Break it down so you all know the deal

[Verse 1]
White boy at first glance
Well that's ‘til I do enhance
Got that shit to make you think
Got that shit to make you dance
It’s been a long journey
I had to find my way
Making music that I love no matter what the haters say
Cause sometimes I want to vibe
And other times i'm ready to rip it up bury the track alive
So long to my nine to five
New school sound
But you know the flow is 1995
So let me elaborate
This is food for thought
Homie grab a plate
I’m on a different planet
You should gravitate
The second I generate ideas they elevate
Feelin’ great
Ain’t know way you could replicate
Swimin in elegance
What’s a pretty face with no intelligence
Its like a stronger fence
With no witnesses or evidence
Case closed
I erase those
Such as fake hoes
And replace those
With beautiful woman

[Hook]
Lemme break it down
Lemme break it down
Break it down so you all feel me
Oh lemme break it down
Break it down
Break it down so you all know the deal
