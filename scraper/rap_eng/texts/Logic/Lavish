This joint for the fans in the stand with their hands in the air, wave left to right
For the Kings and the Queens in the pent house suite, living lavish lives
This joint for the fans in the stand with their hands in the air, wave left to right
For the Kings and the Queens in the pent house suite, living lavish lives
We lavish (lavish), lavish (lavish), caviar with a bad bitch
Ceviche out the chalice, show my people round my palace
Yeah, we lavish (lavish), lavish (lavish), caviar with a bad bitch
Balancing my talents, my black card ain't maxin'

[Verse 1: Just Juice]
Yea, we bout' it
Ousting the foes who doubted
Spouting the flow out my mouth like a fountain
Pose of a stallion, driven like Aston
Hold up, roll up, hit it, pass it
Ridin' high, sittin' low
Mind ainâ€™t right but I'm gettin' though
From the starting line to the end zone
We runnin' the game and that's all that we know
And I'm cooling, just me and my team
G to a T
Tell me who have it, I be
Too under esteemed
Who I'ma be, one of the best with Immaculate steez
And I rap to the beat with an accuracy
Gotta master the craft when you after the cheese
Craft to the suite
Pedal to the metal, never settle for the what?
Never settle for defeat
I'm one of the best though
Swimmin' in women, perfected the breast stroke
Never the less though, I'ma keep it a hundred percent to the death though
I stack that cheese like pesto
On tracks, I beast like Pecko
Just know that I'm ready to ride if you ready to slide and Dip low like techno

[Verse 2: Logic]
Let me get like this, hold up
Get it like this, hold up
Fuck around, get the blunt rolled up
Let me load up, never know what might go down sho'nuff
Motherfucker wanna bluff
Had enough, at the RattPack, never that
Let me get it, I gotta get it like a motherfucker that wanna hit it all night
That's right, just here for the light
Fuck around here for the night
On the road for success, never veer to the right
Here for the fight
Everybody here, alright
Shout out to Juice and Mojo fo' sho' though
Putting this verse in Soho
Oh no, I ain't fuckin' with no ho
Bitch you cannot get a photo
In the back of the 4 door, solo, dolo (Dolo)
Bitch, I'm too, bitch, I'm too, bitch, I'm too alive
Never talk about suicide
Unless we talking 'bout both of the doors on my newer ride
From Maryland way up to Boston
Yea, we be flossin', that shit be do or die
Right now it's you and I
L.O.G.I.C I know I get down
Bow down to the man with the crown

[Verse 3: Mojo]
I got Caviar by the boat load
Fellatio by the throat load
I'm livin' the shit that you dreaming about
And I won't go back to the old school
These ojos seen old hoes
They gold news, my rollie got a rollie
I'm double timing these old dudes
Ride around with a bad broad
Fast car with the top back
Fast lane, like Nascar
Champagne, I pop that
Bought a black car, with a black card
Don't act hard, you not that
Got a Jaguar for the side chick
Now she give me that bobcat
All that and a bag of Lays
Hit the sheets with a freak I bag and lay
They cop feelins' like PD
I cop a feel like David Blaine, it's magic, no hat-trick
I mask emotion, like masquerade on an escapade up in the Escalade
When I drop this track, I'ma escalate
