[Intro: Frank Sinatra]
I would like to be remembered as a man who brought an innovation to popular singing
I would like to be remembered as a man who had a wonderful time living his life and who had good friends, a fine family

[Chorus]
My chain, my chain
Don't you like my chain, mayne?
Life of a don, chain just glowin'
My chain, my chain
Don't you like my chain, mayne?
I'm coming in the club with that fresh shit on
My chain, my chain
Don't you like my chain, mayne?
Life of a don, chain just glowin'
My chain, my chain
Don't you like my chain, mayne?
I'm coming in the club with that fresh shit on

[Verse 1]
Yeah, me and my team used to dream about
The future but now we be rollin' everywhere we goin'
Our cards never showin' the moment I'm flowin' we livin' it right now
Long way from the ghetto
Pull strings like Gepetto poppin' that fine wine
Look at the way my chain shine
Soon as I change my state of mind, from a lazy ass boy
To a man that's on his grind so answer my question
Did I even mention the fact that I'm livin' the life that I wanted
I keep a hunnid, got cash in abundance, that's bills by the hunnid
I've said it and done it, you know that I run it while everyone else
Say it, then plummit now, yeah you know I run it now
While the whole world wonder how
My chain shine nice
But I am not defined by the money, not defined by the ice
What defines me, let me tell you what defines me
Is the heart and the effort I give in e-every letter in which I write for you
And if you ignorant closed minded motherfuckers do not like it
It's not right for you
No it's not right for you

[Chorus]
My chain, my chain
Don't you like my chain, mayne?
Life of a don, chain just glowin'
My chain, my chain
Don't you like my chain, mayne?
I'm coming in the club with that fresh shit on
My chain, my chain
Don't you like my chain, mayne?
Life of a don, chain just glowin'
My chain, my chain
Don't you like my chain, mayne?
I'm coming in the club with that fresh shit on

[Verse 2]
Yeah, I'm swimming in women like Young Sinatra 1 & 2
With the RattPack on my back there's really no telling what we finna do
If a shorty in my eye, then yes baby girl I be coming for you
Nice cars, nice clothes, hotel suites after the shows
So simplistic, never materialistic, but we do like complements
Why? 'Cause theses diamonds are accomplishments
Food stamps, welfare, medicare and section 8 to
Louis V, smoking tree, and steak up on my dinner plate
And you wonder why us rappers floss, cause for once
We can finally afford the cost
I once was the worker now I'm the boss
See my chain is an accomplishment
I call these diamonds milestones
It's hard to call for help with no dial tone
But, now I'm buying whips with no motherfucking miles on 'em
But I don't blow my money, I give it back to people
Why these rappers spend money on blow and stop acting equal?
But I've been real since the fucking prequel
So the next time you that you looking at my chain
What you really see is 23 long years of pain
With nothing to lose and everything to gain
Cause the world is divided, but we are the same
And I'm getting that money, 'cause bitches they love me
And this is the life that I live, ain't it funny
But Imma keep rising, til ya'll realizing, that so much is waiting over the horizon
'Cause I've seen the day and yes also the night
So that means I've seen the darkness as well as the light
And that's the very same light
That's the very same light, that let my chain shine bright
Said that's the very same light, that let my chain shine bright
So...

[Chorus]
My chain, my chain
Don't you like my chain, mayne?
Life of a don, chain just glowin'
My chain, my chain
Don't you like my chain, mayne?
I'm coming in the club with that fresh shit on
My chain, my chain
Don't you like my chain, mayne?
Life of a don, chain just glowin'
My chain, my chain
Don't you like my chain, mayne?
I'm coming in the club with that fresh shit on

[Outro]

Open your eyes
Sinatra
