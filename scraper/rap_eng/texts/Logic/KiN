When it comes to originality
You know these people can't spare us
So when they hear something new
They feel the urge to compare it
Listen close, ’fore this go over your head like Tu-pe
You say I sound like J
They used to compare him to Lupe
But before Cole was Drake
'Cause I was singin' all my hooks
And before ’em all was Eminem
But strictly for my looks
You people make me sick
Hop the fuck off my dick and let me flow
Yes they all inspire me, but I am me
And now you know
So let me hit the studio like a pro
Everything that you ever heard has come right from the soul
And I won't stop until I earn my name, that's my goal
I won't stop until I earn my name, that's my goal
'Cause I am Nas, I am Pac, I am Biggie, I am Jay
I'm am Wu, coming through
Mos Def, here to stay
I'm the roots, I am slim
He is me, I am him
We are all known as one
We were all born KiN
I am hip-hop
We all hip-hop
