[Intro]
I love listening to it from the beginning too
Like there's joints where I don't even want to hear that shit from the beginning dawg
And this is just one of them joints that, like, cites that issue
You know what I mean?
How you feeling right now?
Yeah. It's a little different, you know what I mean
But I got to keep it real so...

[Verse 1: Logic]
Thought it was love but yeah it faded now
I've been to hell and back so I'mma illustrate it now
I wonder how did I end up in this position
The fatal collision of lovers kissing, biting, play fighting
And fucking without no rubbers, yeah, we had it all
But I show no recognition as it all began to fall
Girl what was we thinking?
Love bigger than the Titanic and now we sinking
Resorting to smoking, snorting and drinking
Now I'm thinking you was my sun, I was your moon
Elegantly lightin' up every single room that you walk in
Break up, now I'm stalking, your memory
Honestly, you gave me my identity
Took the prototype and made a better me

[Talking: Logic]
Hey girl, how you doing?
It's me
You know, I've been doing a lot of thinking
And we should probably talk so just give me a call
Peace

[Hook: Kendal]
Here in this wonderless land is a boy and girl
But reading the lines on your hand
Let's me know there's more to know
Some--

[Verse 2: Logic]
Time ticks now I'm feeling ill, I gotta keep it real
My emotion's what I conceal
Now baby do you feel the level of sincerity
When I say I would kill to get what we had back
They say it's better to have loved and lost
Well, I say try it, faking like you ain't hurt but you know and I won't buy it
Used to be full of your love but now I'm on a diet
Can't you feel my pain, I know when you feel the same
I do proclaim ending that wall on my love terrain
My love for your body, remember when we got naughty
Scratching on your back, telling me that you like that
But now when I text you, you won't write back
What the fuck is up with that? I gave you everything
And now you wanna take it back? I can't handle it
Said you loved me, now you acting scandalous
Last time I've seen you everything was fine until you cut the connection
At the drop of a dime, like I ain't paid my phone bill
Fuck that, I keep it real, can't you feel my love?

[Hook: Kendal]
Here in this wonderless land is a boy and girl
But reading the lines on your hand
Let's me know there's more to know
Somehow your powers didn't leave
Oh, but mine took off with the breeze
I'm not sad, it's simply what I've come to be
And I'm not sad, it's simply what I've come to be
And this ain't home but I will live here comfortably
You will be my--

[Verse 3: Logic]
Thought you was faking but, I was mistaken
See, our relationship was long distance, for instance
Do you remember the time when I was horny on the phone
And you wouldn't pay me no mind?
I was feeling all alone but you made it better
I was the ammunition, baby girl was the Beretta
We was made for each other, she always made me feel better
See, I was tripping until I heard the news
She wouldn't talk to me, now I'm so confused
So I took a trip from Maryland to see her
Asking why she wasn't talking to me
Knocking on her door, feeling hella unsure 'til her mother answered
Baby girl, you passed away and all the emotions that I stashed away started coming back
See, I felt terrible for thinking that you left me jack
But you didn't have a choice, God had to have his favorite angel back
With the beautiful voice that I will never hear again
I'm sorry, will you forgive me?
Goodbye

[Hook: Kendal]
Here in this wonderless land is a boy and girl
But reading the lines on your hand
Let's me know there's more to know
Somehow your powers delete
Oh, but mine took off with the breeze
I'm not sad, it's simply what I've come to be
And this ain't home but I will live here comfortably
You will be my--
