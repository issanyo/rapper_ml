[Verse]
And all these Spanish women watchin' me like a Novela
And even when we in the crib I still need an umbrella
'Cause I'm gettin' her wetter than a letterman in the rain
We at the club, 100s and 50s I'm makin it rain, sike nah
All of y'all know I'm kiddin' like the rubber broke
Gettin money and bitches but really that's another note
And all these haters they can suck my dick
'Cause honestly that's the only way you'll ever succeed
Got what you need 'cause I sweat and I bleed
Did it all on my own, didn't beg, didn't plead
Everybody talkin' 'bout "Logic don't sell out!"
Bitch I had a deal for years before it fell out
Doing shit that rappers'll never do you know I'm on that
So why don't I start by telling you what was in my contract?
Make the type of music that I want, check
Work with whoever the hell I want, check
Keep it visionary 'til the death, yep
'Cause I'm doing it for the music not just to get a check
V's up, what up, you know I'm on point
I be chillin' witcha bitch while she rollin' up a joint
Making a killing for a living like a hitman
Rappers hear my new records and be like "aw shit man"
Black card, black power, white fist
Ain't no way in hell a mixed brother didn't write this
And everybody talking shit man screw it
'Cause if you can do it better than me then you do it
Where we going? really there's no tellin'
Lyrical cocaine narcotics is what I'm sellin' ahhhh
Goddamn got bars like a felon
And we gettin' C notes like my homie Jon Bellion, yeah
Visionary to the fullest
We came up out the blue like a crip shootin bullets
Where I'm from muh-fucka I'm from Maryland
G-Berg what up?, I'm snappin' like a Terrapin, flyer than a airplen
Shit I mean a airplane, rapping so fast I can't even get the air to my brain
Runnin' the game like a PS3, flippin' the bird to anybody that BS me
Chillin' in Cali but you know we from the E.S.T,
I got the game in my hand like a PSP,
Chillin' with the homie Castro sippin' 40s
Drop an album out to the fans, cop 'em like the police
RattPack 'till I D I E, greatest rapper to ever do it
I gotta agree, shit
Fuck em all, everybody appalled, flow so clutch my career never stall
Me and my team went to Vegas last week and like a bunch of old men, yeah we balled
I'm tryna do it like ain't nobody done it bitch I run it never plummet you know I'm headed to the summit
And a note to all you rappers tryna do it how I done it
It's impossible rewind the track and learn something from it I'm gone
