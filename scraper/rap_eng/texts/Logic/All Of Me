[Hook: ROZES]
Blow your smoke to fog up the mirror
Write our name in hearts, baby I can see
That you're into me
I need your touch, yeah, I need your fever
Take my broken heart, take all of me
Take all of me

[Verse: Logic]
Yeah, take it all, ain't no way I could break it off
Girl is you really down to pay the cost? Reverse the role and you could play the boss
Already knowin' my... already knowin' my vision is faded
I try to evade it but can't, I know you far from a saint, but I keep lying to me
Cause I been dying to meet and it feel like I follow you out in the street
And I promise you all that I know, every way that my mind goes
Elevated, heart strong but my head faded
Way back when we first dated, I'm gone now, had to go cause I'm on now
When my intuition got me in a mission, we see eye to eye but you ain't in my vision
Oh no, I said oh no
Back in the day I used to say a girl like you
I used to pray for days for
Now I'm out here like way more, what the fuck would I stay for?
Why the fuck would I pay for somethin' thatâ€™s just gonna kill me? Nikki I'm still me
But I'm just better, it's been six months since we touched last
But I grow fast with this letter and I swear to God that I'm better

[Hook: ROZES]
Blow your smoke to fog up the mirror
Write our name in hearts, baby I can see
That you're into me
I need your touch yeah I need your fever
Take my broken heart, take all of me
Take all of me
Blow your smoke to fog up the mirror
Write our name in hearts, baby I can see
That you're into me
I need your touch, I need your fever
Take my broken heart, take all of me
Take all of me

[Outro: ROZES]
Take all of me, take all of me
Take all of me, take all of me
