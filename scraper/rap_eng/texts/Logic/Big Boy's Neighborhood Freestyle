[Verse 1]
I say, “hey now, brother,” sike, nah
L-O-G-I-C, all up in this vicinity, you know it's me
This is how we do it all day
Goddamn, can you feel it
All up in the spirit
I can get it, I can do it
L.A, hell yeah, let me get it for the bay
For the M to the D, to the N.Y.C
This is how we do it, 'bout to kick this free off the top
This is how we do it all the time
I just kicked Nikki in the fucking face
Goddamn, can you feel it when I'm all up in the place
Gotta do it right now, gotta do it right now
When I spit it, no, you know I'm never lost
Hold up, tell me big, how much is a pie cost?
Let me get it, let me spit it, let me bring it back like this
We having a good time, design this rhyme
I spit, random thought off the top, of my mind
Goddamn, can you feel it, yes, I got it, feeling hella good
Ain't got no driver's license, but you know I'm driven
The second I spit it, everything that's what I'm giving
Yeah, I get it off the top, T-O-P, I gotta say it
I spray it, never delay it the second I mayday it
Goddamn, I’ma get it on, gotta get it on
Gotta spit it, I get it, I rip it, can you feel it now
Like I'm Jamaican, I'm spittin’ off the top, brudda!
Goddamn, let me get it, word to your mother
I'm having fun, gotta do it
Never, never pack the gun
‘Cause I spit it off the top like a ton
Goddamn, yeah, I gotta do it one time
Def Jam, V's up, this is how we do, it ease up
Please up, can you feel it all up in my spirit
It doesn't even matter, random thought
These, these, this decision I get it, second incision
And spit it and this is how we do it, yeah, I gotta get it
Never regret it the second I said it, it's so fucking pathetic
Your etiquette murder your predicate
Bring it back again
Half-white, half-black again
This is all they want to talk about, and yeah, I'm mac'ing in
I got Krystal Bee to the right, Louie G to the left
Everything is out of sight and I'm going off
Under Pressure, October 21, already came out
Gotta spit this free verse
Strictly off the top, I never drop, never stop
Oh, goddamn, go to Best Buy and fucking cop, get the physical
This is how we do it so medicinal
No, I'm never smoking, but your girl is chocking on this — whoo!
Sorry 'bout that, let me bring it back
Can you feel it, goddamn, goddamn
I could go on for days and days, never delays and laze
This is how we do, spit it, think I need some sun rays
I've been in the house too long, just spitting this
Let me change up the beat, yeah, I'm ripping this, I got it
You know you got it on the one's and the two's
My man's in there, doing what it do's
I'm from Maryland, in your system like heroin
This is how we do it, can you feel it when I'm staring in
I'm just going and going, I'm flowing and flowing, why?
I'm ripping and living and striving to kill it
To rip, I gotta get it right now when I do it
When I got it, when we crewin’, uh
You want me to stop, should I stop, should I keep going?
Should I keep flowing?
Never knowing the direction in which I'm going
I spit it, I got it, I gotta get it, goddamn

[Hook: Big Boy]
And you don't, and you don't, and you don't
And you don't, and you don't, and you don't
And you don't, and you don't, and you don't, and you don't, and you don't stop!

[Verse 2]
My favorite, my favorite song of all time is what?
Something by Wu-Tang, or maybe Ice-Cube "It Was a Good Day"
This is all I gotta say, yeah, you know the deal
Yeah, you know the deal, how I feel
I could keep going and going and going and going and going on
This is how we do it 'til the break of dawn
Goddamn, I was in New York yesterday, now I'm in L.A
I just don't know what to say
I'm feeling so damn good
Feeling so damn fine like Mos Def in Brooklyn in a park
West Deer Park, come out after dark, that's where the murder start
Don't let me stop, let me stop, let me keep it going
This is how we do it
Switch the beat up again, switch the beat up again, come on

[Hook: Big Boy]
And you don't, and you don't, and you don't
And you don't, and you don't, and you don't
And you don't, and you don't, and you don't, and you don't, and you don't stop!

[Verse 3]
Check it, check it, let me keep it up
This is how we do it, let me beat it up
I'm feeling this villainous vibe, this shit is hella crazy
You never amaze me, I'm never feeling lazy
Like I said, this is random thought, the shit that can't be tought
It's just emotional
I never provoke it, I spit it, never choke it
Goddamn, this ain't, no 8 Mile, B-Rabbit
The second I spit it, I gotta have it, I gotta do it
Never dab it like my homie Slay Dro at the crib
This is how we do it, put it in the bitches' rib
Everything I got is what I'm finna give
But my queen, she's a beauty
This is how we do it, goddamn, such a cutie
Uh, let me spit it, yeah, she's sweet like 5 stars
I gotta get it right now
I'm kinda hungry, 'bout to hit Five Guys, pause
Sike, nah, I'm just fuckin’ around
Let me get it, no beef
Nah, we squash that, this is how we do it
We 'bout the lettuce, we toss that, uh, goddamn
It's so crazy, such a particular case
My man Louie G looking like he just came back from outer space
It's just much more than a hare race, you're moving at a snail's pace
Goddamn, I'm just switchin’ the flow
Never know, half-white, half-negro
You know we gotta spit it, that's for sure
I love who I am, love who I ain't
This is how we do it, let me spit it
Just let me paint, the picture, the second I get richer, I get bigger
Can you feel it, the second I got it, I got six figures and commas
I never pause though, unless I need it, this is how we do it
That's word to Anita, we need to bring it back
I love the beat, let's go again
Let's go again, let's go again, come on

[Hook: Big Boy]
And you don't, and you don't, and you don't
And you don't, and you don't, and you don't
And you don't, and you don't, and you don't, and you don't, and you don't stop!

[Verse 4]
Let me spit it like this it's, so ridiculous
Goddamn, I know you feel it
Wu-Tang, hit you with the killer B
Goddamn, that's my thing when I spit it, when I sing
Oh my God, going crazy, it never does amaze me
Never lazy when I spit it off the top
The topic is hella awesome
Yo, it's like freestyle, the art of a rhyme
The second I spit it, in my mind, I design
I bring it back, I might say some of the things twice
Or three times in a row, but it doesn't matter, that's for sure
We just having a good time
The second I rhyme, I spit it divine
Goddamn, it's so crazy, it's off the top of my mind
I'm from Maryland, how many times must I say it
I spray it, never delay it, I bring it back like this
Uh, I look around, I see a lot of beautiful people
What's next after Under Pressure, the sequel?
Maybe a prequel, we take it back, even before my birth, where hip-hop started
This is how we do it, damn, goddamn
I never farted, but this shit's stinking
This is how we do it
Second that I get it, you're probably thinkin’ I'm drinkin’
But I never touch this stuff
‘Cause the only thing I need to succeed is this money in my pocket, goddamn
Wanted to greed, unless we want to talk gluttony
And even something else from the seven deadly
How we get it, yeah, I'm ready, just the medley
I be on, goddamn, it's crazy, this is when I'm going
Goddamn, I just feel it, I love it, I gotta get it
This is how we do it, switch it up, speed it up
Let me get it, that's enough
Goddamn, can you feel it
Can we go one more time, come on tell 'em, let's go
One more time, come on, tell 'em, let's go
How we go now

[Hook: Big Boy]
And you don't, and you don't, and you don't
And you don't, and you don't, and you don't
And you don't, and you don't, and you don't, and you don't, and you don't stop!

[Verse 5]
Now this, this right here is the finale
It's never written, that shit is forbidden
Is you kiddin‘, you gotta see me now
This is how they do it when they see me, yes, I smile
All the time, spit it off the top, when I do I rhyme
I gotta keep it going, gotta, gotta keep it flowing
I just love it, nothing above it the second I touch it
The second I got it, it's ever enough
I'm like a human dictionary, paint pictures like pictionary
It's hella scary, these motherfuckers think that they can see me
But, I see right through y'all
See, I see the bigger picture like I work at the movies
These motherfucking groupies wanna get next to me
I'm like nah, bitch, don't touch me, you need to understand
I'm an actually, I'm a nice guy, so, I don't fuck with hoes
You understand what I'm saying?
I'm all about my money, all about this shit
All about my team, all about the hits
This is what I gotta do, this shit is legendary, it's never scary
The second I spit it, it's what?
It's like an obituary
What I'm spitting isn't written, ‘cause I murder you motherfuckers off the top
This is how we do it, yeah, I bring the ruckus
I'm a good motherfucker, and I represent hip-hop
So, all this other extra bullshit, please stop
This is who I am, I am just a man, I am, who I am
Motherfucker, that's me
The L-O-G-I-C, repping V, Visionary off the top
Shoutout to the R-A-double-T-P-A-C-K, everyday
How we get it, and the BobbySoxers, yeah, I know y'all, love ya
I gotta get it, yeah, I gotta get it
Yeah, I'm not kidding like I ain't have a rubber
Goddamn, can I get it, word to your mother
I'm just a man, I be loving it, loving it, rubbing it, rubbing it
Come on, baby girl, tell me how you feel, let me get it, let me get it
Let me get it, let me get it, can you feel it?
I'm just loving it, loving it
Bring it, bring it right back, this is hella cazy
Maybe half on the sack, used to smoke a little tree, back in tenth grade
Honeys, honeys, I could never evade
I was just skipping school, breaking all the rules, coming from a broken home
Felt like I was, I was all alone in, in, all up in a different type of zone
I would close my eyes, and then I hit the microphone
Goddamn, I was writing in my past, just a young man
It's kinda crazy, I feel like you could just keep going forever, forever, forever-ever?
Like my name was Andre 3k
Goddamn, that's what I gotta say
But I’ma stop it right here, right now, understand
No other MC could measure
October 21st, it was done, Under Pressure
It's Logic
