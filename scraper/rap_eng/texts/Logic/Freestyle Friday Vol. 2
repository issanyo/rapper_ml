[Chorus]
Cocaine, cocaine, cocaine, cocaine, molly
Percocet, my rep move up like a dolly
If I talk about this shit more often, probably
If I talk about this shit more often, more often
Cocaine, cocaine, cocaine, cocaine, molly
Percocet, my rep move up like a dolly
If I talk about this shit more often, probably
If I talk about this shit more often, more often

[Verse]
I ain't never fuckin' with no sneak diss
Best get off my dick, boy, you better not repeat this
Cocaine what I flip, jump in the whip, cannot compete with
A real OG like me, you know I get that dough like deep dish
Got the party jumping in Atlanta like I'm Freaknik
Got the party jumping in Atlanta like I'm Donald Glover
I don't want no good girl, I'm thinking I need a freak bitch
I don't want no good girl, cause your boy ain't no lover
Fuck her with no rubber then I bounce back
Smokin' on some shit so good, I can't even pronounce that
Shawty, drop it low and make it bounce back
Smokin' on some shit so good I can't even pronounce-nounce
