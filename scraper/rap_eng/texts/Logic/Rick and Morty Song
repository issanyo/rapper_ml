[Intro]
Aw yeah
It's goin' down
It's Logic, y'all
Shout out to my boy, Rick
Are you ready?

[Verse 1]
There's a choo choo train, man, he's rolling down Tragedy
Everybody knows Supernova fights gravity
[?]

[Verse 2]
It's Logic, y'all
Shit don't get me started about the one and only man
[?]
Can't forget about the one who never seems to get a chance
(Noob Noob)
All the bitches come around for Noob Noob
His dick gets more business than YouTube
Everybody, everybody is Noob Noob
Say everybody, everybody is

[Outro]
Yo, it's Logic once again, y'all, don't forget the name
Make sure you get home safe
And man, we gotta all give it up for Rick 'cause
I mean what kind of motherfucker just sets up a whole festival like this when he's completely loaded, man?
And all that stuff I said about Vance? That's not real
Vance, fuck that guy, that guy sucks dick
Woo, yeah
Yo, d-did I get paid yet? Woo
