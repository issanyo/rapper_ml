[Chorus: X Ambassadors]
We're smart enough to know that no one gets out alive
(Never, ever)
Hold on to someone close, friend
Cause you're never too young
You're never too young, you're never too young to die
Remember the ghosts before you
And drink to their souls tonight
And don't forget what they told you
You're never too young
You're never too young, you're never too young to die

[Post-Chorus: X Ambassadors]
You're never too young
You're never too, never too
No, you're never too young
Never, never

[Verse: Logic]
Uh, tell me is it the day I made it?
Feel like the world is over, don't know why I've been created
I've been under pressure but nevertheless I know nothing can measure
Feeling outdated, everybody inebriated
Feel like I'm automated, I'm automated, I'm automated
No, never faded, but debated, a visionary that made it
As it escalated, I elevated and feel like I raided the game
Cause all of this, it just sounded the same in my mind

[Chorus: X Ambassadors]
We're smart enough to know that no one gets out alive
(Never, ever)
Hold on to someone close, friend
Cause you're never too young
You're never too young, you're never too young to die
Remember the ghosts before you
And drink to their souls tonight
And don't forget what they told you
You're never too young
You're never too young, you're never too young to die
(Die)

[Post-Chorus: X Ambassadors]
You're never too young
You're never too young
Never, never
You're never too young
You're never too young
Never, never
Never, never
Never, never
Never, never
No, you're never too young
Never, never
Never, never
Never, never (oh)
Never, never
Yeah
Never to young
Never to young
Never to young to die

[Chorus: X Ambassadors]
We're smart enough to know that no one gets out alive
(Never, ever)
Hold on to someone close, friend
Cause you're never too young
You're never too young, you're never too young to die
Remember the ghosts before you
And drink to their souls tonight
And don't forget what they told you
You're never too young
You're never too young, you're never too young to die
