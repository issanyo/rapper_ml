Lyrics from Snippet

[Chorus]
Hold me
In your loving arms, please
Please don't be alarmed, no
Don’t sound the alarm
Hold me, with your loving arms girl
Please don't be alarmed, no
Don’t sound the alarm

[Verse]
With you I
With you I
Wish I was handsome
I wish I was funny
I wish I was smart and had a whole lot of money
I wish I was good enough
For you
Wish I was handsome
I wish I was funny
I wish I was smart and had a whole lot of money
I wish I was good enough
For you
