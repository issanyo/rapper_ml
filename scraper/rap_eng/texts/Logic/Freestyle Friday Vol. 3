500 thousand for a one off
Hit the stage, I rage, and then I run off
It don't matter where we at, it's poppin' like a gun off
Bumping N.W.A. on the 101, uh
500 thousand for a one off
Hit the stage, I rage, and then I run off
It don't matter where we at, it's poppin' like a gun off
Bumping N.W.A. on the 101, uh

[Verse]
Skinny Nikki geeky getting brain dead, uh
I don't give a fuck what the lames said, uh
Old girl wanna give the boy head
How about a little bitty, self love instead
I can't fuck a hoe, I'd rather self love instead
Can't save a hoe, no S on my chest, or gun to my head
Ah, get the bread, ah, get the bread, ah
Count this fucking money, boy now get the bread
I ain't just tryin' to get the nut off
Bobby Boy be cool to leave a bad bitch cut off
Like when you in the studio and the vocal get cut off-
