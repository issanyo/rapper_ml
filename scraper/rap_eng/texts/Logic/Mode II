[Verse 1: Royce Da 5'9]
Yeah, fall in line
To fall back, Big L's technique, Pun's grammar
Before the roof went in the trunk, the ragtops
Sat back behind the head, just like a gun hammer
My sickness, should remind you of Christmas, cause
I’m always coming down with something, like a young Santa
Understand, there will be no rematch
The kinda ass whooping, you’ll only have to open up one can of
(Nickel Nine the God) Huh?
You ain’t rolling forward, you’re rolling wrong
Reaching out to gangstas, to be gangsta, you holding on
I grab a hold of this .44 long, and let it go
More than a 4 year old, singing the Frozen song
I put this Tec to your eclectic temple
And wreck your wit, then carve in your tombstone:
“Heavenly Father, he wasn’t ready to collide with a force
To be reckoned with.” Do you boys know who you messing with?
I’m with messing-with-niggas-destiny shit, I'm from the Midwest, I stopped drinking so I can start policing
The block, now I just cop smoke, like pig breath
Pac’s soul would come out, if I died a big death
Shoe connoisseur, who’s finer, your bitch?
Or my bitch? It don’t matter, cause you with my ex
The name of my ex inked on you, to me homie
Extinct, like a dinosaur, you can probably find me spooning
With a dime looking like Lucy Liu, or something to my broom
Looking like, a huge China drawer, I’m a motherfucking
Walking hazard, find me in the bodying department
When y’all rhyming, if y’all own release remind me
Of Prodigy partner, y’all can have it, I man up
Lifted the can up, killed the killer, who ran up scared
When I was eight, my daddy yelled down the basement steps:
"You only gotta listen to me, and the man upstairs!"

[Hook 1: Royce Da 5'9 + Logic]
Cause I’m in motherfucking beast mode
Beast mode, homie I’m in beast mode
(Know who I am) Beast mode

[Verse 2: Logic]
Yeah, yeah, fuck a black, brown, yellow or white it’s about unity
While the media tryna twist my words, for the opportunity to ruin me
Fuck ‘em all, bitch, I’m still doing me
It’s you and me on the record I’ll detect it like an infected nervous system
I never miss, I murder my mission as the rendition I listen while my chain glisten
I’ma get it like the world is endin'
Dependent on if it’s impending
Defendin' my mind in the way I rhyme so I’m sendin' in
The best of the best, no never the less I never digress I just keep it moving
Finger fuck who ain’t on improving
We finally grooving, on the way, no way to remove them
We constantly improving, yeah, through rejuvenation
I said juveniles run the nation, come now, fuck your occupation
A revelation I’m facing, more secretive than a mason
It look like we neck and neck but I’m far from adjacent
I come so far from that basement
They look at me and know I'm in beast mode

[Hook 2: Royce da 5'9" + Logic]
I’m in beast mode
Then it’s game time, beast mode
I’m a beast, I’m in beast mode
Know who I am Beast mode
I’m, I’m in the zone for realer

[Verse 3: Royce Da 5'9]
You roll down on me they gonna call craps
We don't call cops we just rolls so they call paps
Y'all in my office, similes all facts
Yes I fought wars, my enemies all wack
Check your chalkboard
Critics said things shit they ain't even killing they arsenals
Me and the God flow
Guard the team like Damian Lillard the stiller
And poke your chest out like Cardinals
Y'all rhyme schemes are escargot, mine's a Newport
Marlboro, Chicago next shops to Chiraq
Pirates turning niggas' skill into the dog bone
Y'all go fetch and this is all from me being barked on
And now your dog gone
And I'm a daw-gone vet
So you might wanna resort to more peaceful matters
My bitch flirt with an entertainer, he can have her
I was taught that when there's beef to just keep quiet
And peep his pattern
If he strikes shepherd, the sheep will scatter
Extendos, hanging out the windows
Of them Benzos, assumptions you have them in your window
Hip-hop is just an outlet for y'all to follow
The fakes, not over the hill just know the high road to take
No cheeks to turn and all I know is I ain't all out of hallows
The symbolism of me inside a diablo
Playing Mariah, burning this money fast
Until I'm all out of high notes
Nigga my weight up
So much that I no longer challenge haters
From no on I'm a call out a high-low

[Interlude]
Nickel-Nine the God

[Hook 1: Royce Da 5'9 + Logic]
Then it’s game time cause I’m in motherfucking beast mode
Beast mode, homie I’m in beast mode
Know who I am beast mode

[Verse 4: Logic]
Yeah, it's the return of the mad rapper, dead president kidnapper
Motivated, underrated, most hated
Talk shit behind my back but in person congratulated
Damn this is my vision written without a revision
Like I am lost in a matrix I'm everything but complacent
Like my dream is adjacent but I can't make a move
Fifteen writing rhymes inspired by Illmatic
I'm still at it, every record I record leave the record shattered
Cause I be in the lab for a month
Searching for inner peace through meditation like a monk
I'm over their head and yet they still sleeping like a bottom bunk
Why these thirsty bitches throw me pussy like I got them drunk
I master the flow these up and comers have only spilt
I got back from Ireland so you know the show I kilt
I never truly admire the empire I built
Cause when you're comfortable power shifts and positions tilt
At business meetings I go through lyrics within my mind
Cause the ultimate therapy is whenever I rhyme
First time shaking their hand for the fifth time
Being introduced to people that used to pay me no mind
Used to count my money now I weigh it by the crate
Far from an up-and-comer, my competition’s the greats and
I don't give my wifey the rubber, like raw sex
I give her the plastic cause I'm the one that cut the checks now
Yeah, my flow expand like frozen water
I fathered these motherfuckers just like a daughter
And if they want beef then I gotta little slaughter
My bars are hotter than the steel cages after the solder
It's nada, everything you plan on doing we already thought of
Talking years before you fuckers because we work harder
See I've been at it from the start
Married to the game 'till death do us part

[Hook 2: Royce da 5'9"  + Logic]
I’m in beast mode
Then it’s game time, beast mode
I’m a beast I’m in beast mode
Know who I am, beast mode
I’m, I’m in the zone for realer

[Verse 5: Royce Da 5'9]
I'm the highest, exalted
Rappers are doing a lot of talking
You're tired of me living then you'll probably die of exhaustion
The fliest looking like I've got a living stylus
Later for sales, you know who got the illest album
Loaded a chopper with slugs, call that the K Michelle
Then I dump that bitch, now that's the Idris Alba
Bitch niggas get with a nigga bitch
Just to call a nigga a bitch nigga to a nigga bitch
Ain't gotta be in no cemetery to dig a ditch
Don't need bananas and Ben and Jerry's to get a split
Wig, you know I'm big slipping through new equip
Stop gassing you know we couldn't care less if you a chick
The tech popping like a question get it right
Triggers mic, put a niggas wife in the air like Ludacris
(Nickel-Nine the God) I'm a beast
Fall in line or fall back
I'm plugged into the shooters
What I say isn't forced with a connect
So this ain't all rap
We coned the perimeter in all black
Like the back of Forest Whitaker's neck
Niggas get all naps
You woulda, coulda, shoulda ass niggas
Couldn't fuck a bitch with pills and jello pudding gas nigga
If you ever ever hear about me taking shit
Best believe there's toilets in the safe
And I'm on it eating spaghetti bolognaise
And if you in my lane
I hope you know you rolling with grenades
I'm the coldest, you the hoest
I'll let you switch places with me if Drea agrees
Then she gonna come through and delete my wholeness with a face

[Hook 2]
Then it’s game time, beast mode
I’m a beast, I’m in beast mode
Know who I am, beast mode
I’m, I’m in the zone for realer
Then it’s game time, beast mode
I’m a beast, beast mode
Know who I am, beast mode

[Outro: Royce Da 5'9]
5, 5’9, 5, 5’9
5’9, 5, 5’9, 5, 5, 5’9
5, 5’9, beast mode
PRhyme!
