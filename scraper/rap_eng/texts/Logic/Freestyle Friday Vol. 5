[Verse]
Come on baby
Come on girl
Lemme rock ya world
I'm probably gonna rock ya world
Lord knows I need ya, girl
'Cause the hole in my heart could fill the world
So come on baby
Come on now
I was high as a kite
But  like The Price Is Right, I'm comin' down
Girl I'm comin'
Comin' for you
And by the end of the night, you gon' be comin' too
Uh, I said girl I'm comin'
Comin' for you
And by the end of the night, you gon' be comin' too
