[Hook]
Yes, I want it all
The girls, the clothes, the cars
My name within the stars, standin' as they applaud
Yes I—yes I want it all
The money and the fame breaking in the game
My name, in lights, yes, I want it all
The girls, the clothes, the cars
My name within the stars, standin' as they applaud
Yes I—yes I want it all
The money and the fame breaking in the game
My name, in lights

[Verse 1]
Yes, I want it all from the big to the little, things
When you hear my voice it rings
C-notes in my pocket, cause logic does not prefer to sing,
All the women know what I'm about
Make music then I dig 'em out
Cause I got it, flow hypnotic
And not a single one of y'all doubt it
And when I think about the life I live and the studio time I give
To the fans in the stands, usually kill it but now you can dance
Cause this is a banger, logic is not a stranger
To makin' that music that make you feel better
Whatever, whenever, however I'm just rhyming oh so clever
Gotta flip it up just like coke
Step to this mic in this murder I wrote
I feel like I can keep it real
On my independent shit cause I don't need a deal
You see I want it now
Step into the stage and everybody wonder how
How you kill it like you do?
Every time that you walk through
Yes I want it all, but I don't have it all
So I'mma stand tall, until I get it all, until I get it all

[Hook]
Yes, I want it all
The girls, the clothes, the cars
My name within the stars, standin' as they applaud
Yes I—yes I want it all
The money and the fame breaking in the game
My name, in lights, yes, I want it all
The girls, the clothes, the cars
My name within the stars, standin' as they applaud
Yes I—yes I want it all
The money and the fame breaking in the game
My name, in lights

[Verse 2]
I want the most dead presidents like VA graveyards
Rappin' is a profession, why you still at your day job
Yes, I want it all—that money in the –illions
Why make trillions, when we could make gillions?
You can check the swagger, stuntin' on 'em like Knievel
Pussy in my lap, blastin' off like Dr. Evil

[Hook]
Yes, I want it all
The girls, the clothes, the cars
My name within the stars, standin' as they applaud
Yes I—yes I want it all
The money and the fame breaking in the game
My name, in lights, yes, I want it all
The girls, the clothes, the cars
My name within the stars, standin' as they applaud
Yes I—yes I want it all
The money and the fame breaking in the game
My name, in lights
