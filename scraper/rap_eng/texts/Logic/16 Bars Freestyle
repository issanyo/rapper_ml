[Verse]
Living life like this is so crazy
This world is amazing
One day you're on top and then she having your baby
Living life like this I get down... Uhh
When they come around
I do my best to fall back and not, not make a sound
Feel like my mind gone but I'm still here
Don't fuck around cause they kill here
This music, it kill fear
I use it when I need to hear
Been there, done that
Drop this shit, they gonna run it back
Stupid shit, man I'm done with that
Fake rap, take it back
My chain heavy, got a lot of money, my bitch bad, have fun with that
I've been there and don't want it back
If I see the bitch I might run it back cause I'm gone
