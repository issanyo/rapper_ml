This is... one of my favorites on the album. It's produced by Rob Knox and myself, and um, it's such a blast with him, creating the song. You know, the classic break and just kind of doing my rendition of that break and putting that together and then Rob just playing the keys and it rose over... it's just such an incredible vibe. It's basically a tale of, um, my time around the world - touring. Starting out in College Park, Maryland with all the homies back in the basement, hitting the road, in a minivan, for the first time, you know what I'm saying? The first time ever, in the freezing cold, going to Chicago and selling out my first show there... and different things like that until eventually going to Europe and riding the train and [I] ended up in Belgium and Amsterdam and Switzerland and this and that and all these really beautiful places. I just wanted to talk about it. Talk about my fear of flying, which I'm getting over, all these, just, I wanted the people to hear the humility and the honesty and just like, you know...

It's weird, even now, recording this for Spotify and the listeners now, like, I-I love Spotify, this is where I find all my samples and to think that theres somebody out there, listening to me talk to them, and they want to know about my album; it's very surreal. That's what I believe encompasses  the song, at least that's what... Yeah, it's just about my travels; from A to B, here to there, and everywhere in between. It was originally going to be called "Planes, Trains and Automobiles," but I went with "Metropolis," the neo-city of-of the world, if you will, it's definitely filled with my cinematic inspiration - And you can hear it, so yeah, yeah, enjoy it
