[Scene V]

[THOMAS:]
Okay, so what do you think life was like before the fall? I mean we've seen pictures of open land as far as the eye can see and oceans incomprehensible in size that our grandparents would do their best to describe it. I just can't imagine life anywhere but inside a space station. I mean the simple concept of a sky doesn't even fully register...

[KAI:]
We do have fields on the Babel station and also—

[THOMAS:]
Yeah, yeah—but that's all synthetic. I mean we're heading to this planet right? That we call "Paradise", because we hope it can sustain life. Why?"

[KAI:]
Because we'll eventually run out of resources...

[THOMAS:]
Exactly! I mean what if we got there and it's exactly as the data predicted: beautiful, lush—then we destroy it just like we did Earth? There's only 5 million human beings left in the universe. I mean, it's weird to think about the fact that in 2065 the last footprint was left on Earth before ascending to Babel.

[KAI:]
Man, what's your point?

[THOMAS:]
The point is, 30 ships have traveled in deep space looking for a planet like this. Damn near all of them return without any luck! Some of them didn't return at all. I guess my fear isn't that we won't find Paradise: it's that we'll create purgatory...
