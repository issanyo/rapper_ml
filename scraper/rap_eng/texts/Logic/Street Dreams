[Intro: DJ Premier (Sampled)]
Big L—rest in peace

[Verse]
2 a.m, just got outta the bar, headed toward my car
Me and Castro kind of blown 'cause we parked so far
Walkin' down the street, spot a couple of goonies on the creep
Pocket full of cash, so we dash fast, to avoid they ass
'Cause we know they trailin' now we on the run
Heavily inhaling, exhaling as I begin to caress my gun
We gettin' closer to our destination
I always mind my business but, somehow I find myself in these situations
Death what I'm facin' if I give up now
They started poppin', so you know we exchangin' bullets in the street
He dropped one, but I graze another
And in the heat of the moment I thought about my girl and how much I love her
Prayin' to god that tonight wasn't my last supper
'Cause they tryin' to spill my blood and break me for this bread
Motherfucker take all this lead, yeah, that's what I said
That's two down and two to go
But, then the others disappeared, yo
So, now we on the roll, finally made it back to the car
My homie thinkin' that we all good, but hold up, there they are
Buckin' fast in the XLR
Goddamn what a mission, thought process, keys to ignition
Tryna ditch ‘em, so now we in the whip speedin'
Dodgin' bullets as we proceedin' to my man Lenbo
These bammers try to play us like Nintendo, hell no
Hit him on the phone, let him know we wasn't alone
Comin' through the zone, my homie picked up before the dial tone
"What up my man, what's good? Is everything okay?"
Hell nah, get your heater and be ready to spray
Pulled up to his crib and my man was ready to go, hah
Jumped in the back with a semi-automatic
Bustin' erratic, quite the lethal weapon addict, so we let 'em have it
Weaving in and out of traffic until we lost 'em
Whippin' for a couple of minutes wishin' we could've tossed ‘em
So now I'm drivin, thankin' God that I'm still survivin'
Received the call from my man Boss, he was chillin' and vibin'
Said he was on the road, found out about a block away
So, I said “let’s get up, I got a story that’ll blow you away”
Couple minutes passed, met up at a red light
Called him on his celly, said "Let's hit the deli and grab a bite"
So now it's me, Lenbo and Castro inside of my car
Plus, my homie Boss trailin' behind us, but not too far
Now we on the strip, everybody cool and legit
'Til I hear my man Castro yell out "Oh shit!"
Here come the motherfuckers again out the blue like a crip
They must've followed us, tryna take out the whole lot of us
Now they bustin' at Boss, one blew his tire, made him crash
Now they comin' for ours, I hit the uey, while my man blast
Hit the passenger in the dome, now his brain’s up on the dash
The driver stopped, tryna clean the blood up off the glass
Givin' us just enough time to go and pick up Boss' ass
All together, started raining, I hate this weather
But it didn't matter, only thing on my mind is vendetta
'Cause now it's four-to-one, he scared as shit and we chasin' son
Hit the highway, doin' it up by a buck and some
Castro halfway out the sunroof firin'
No fear, so, I guess that's what I do admire him
Ducking strays, ‘til he caught one in his shoulder
Fell back, gushin' blood, but my man a soldier
He hit the exit, now we whippin' through the city
Contemplating, how the situations getting shitty
Now we out of ammo, so we sped up to the side of his ride
Intending to collide, hit him quick and watched the whip slide
My man Boss grabbed the gat from Lenbo, half out the window
Shot the gas tank, we watched the whole thing blow
Now we laughin' headed to the hospital for Castro
*Laughter*
Oh no, I guess popo got wind of the blow
'Cause like 15 cars came out of nowhere yo
And now they on pursuit, didn't even hesitate to shoot
Murder weapon possession and a trunk full of loot
If we get caught it's either life or death so fuck 'em
Might as well go out blazin', we just might duck 'em
Hit a hard right, doing 120 through a warehouse
Hit the lights and the engine so they don’t know our whereabouts
Just around the corner was a bridge out of the city
No cops in sight, me and my homies feelin' giddy
My man Castro, was like “Fuck them coppers”
But, speak of the devil 'cause appeared two choppers
They lights on us, callin' out cars to our location
Mind racin', checked the rearview
Saw every cop from the fuckin' station, their boat was comin'
And the bridge was risin', you shoulda saw it
Told my boys to buckle up, because I’m ‘bout to floor it
Everything was perfectly aligned and we was at a good speed
My homie Lenbo didn't hesitate to spark the good weed
Feelin' like I'm home free halfway up the ramp
Escape is my goal, but, open fire hit the tire
Now we outta control, off of the bridge we go

[Skit: Logic & [?]]
Logic, yo Logic, yo, wake up man, Logic, yo, wake up, man, Logic, wake up, man
Wassup?
We're finally here, man
Oh
The studio, let's go
Oh, all right, all right
I just had the craziest fucking dream, dawg
