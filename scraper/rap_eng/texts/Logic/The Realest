[Intro]
I said I'm a realist

[Verse 1]
L-O-G-I-C
Only real motherfuckers know B-O-B
Bad bitches wanna fuck me like POV
84 West Deer Park, 203
If you know that there, then you know who I be
R-A-double T till I D-I-E in the VIP
Everybody turn they head when they see I be
Playin' bitches like a DVD
And they say they want the old me
But the old me, that's the young me
I know a lot more now, that's the dumb me
Talkin' that shit, get the fuck around from me
Man, goddamn
I'm the motherfuckin' man
Feelin' like I am
Never take a break from the real rap, yeah, I'm still that
Gotta seal that, but I wanna jam
I'm a realist!
A realist that happens to be the realest
So the fakers, oh no, they won't never feel this
They might talk shit but no, they could never steal this
I'm a realist! (yeah, yeah, yeah)
A realist that happens to be the realest (yeah!)
So the fakers (yeah), oh no (yeah, yeah!) they won't never feel this
They might talk shit (yeah) but no, they could never steal this
I'm a realist!

[Verse 2]
Chillin' in the crib, put it all up in a bitch rib
Got a lot to give but I don't give a fuck
Pull up in a dump truck, I don't mean to interrupt
What's up? Chilling in the cut
Homie give a damn 'bout that shit if it sound tight
Doesn't even matter if the grammar right
Bust on your bitch like the hammer might
We in a MGM havin' a hell of a night
I'm gettin' sued for my name
Nothing I would never do for the fame
Tell me who coulda blamed me
Still the same me but I'm not
Motherfucker looking like Squints from The Sandlot
Running from the cops
So I pray to the great Bambino
Call me Bobby Tarantino
I don't give a fuck, bitch we know
They only in it for the C-Notes
Am I in it for the, in it for the ahh?
This is me sippin' that Kool-Aid
I'm too paid, already I'm too paid
Gettin big with money
Motherfucker did you not hear me say I'm too paid
I'm in this bitch runnin', I'm in this bitch workin'
You know I put work in
It's funny how they only pay attention when that mommy go twerkin'
Ignorant shit, I'm just not into this shit
But everyone know, Logic, he spit the realest!

[Chorus]
'Bout to get it right now (yeah, yeah)
Uh, get it right now (uh, yeah)
Uh, get it right now
'Bout to get it right now (uh, yeah)
Get it right now (uh, yeah)
Get it right now
'Bout to get it right now
Right now, right now
Uh yeah (right now), get it right now (right now)
'Bout to get it right now (right now)
