[Intro]
From Uptown, Downtown
In town, out of town
We got it going on

[Verse 1: Phil Ade]
They ask me where I'm from, sometimes I get confused
Cause I ain't from the city, although I rep it too
But this is still my home, not where I lay at night
This is more than a city, this here is a way of life
It stretches over to my state and then back
Where you can see everything from legislation to crack
And the education for blacks is get it by any means
Where niggas in the hood ain't scared to wear skinny jeans
There's plenty young-ins clubbing and Moet chugging
Jumping every night this a life you can get stuck in
Sipping a cup of Henny xo, ex ho ducking
And parties with ball players and sports we got no luck in
This is fucking ridiculous niggas be too meticulous, opinionated
Never had shit but still be the pickiest
Look at how sick he is, the son of a nurse
Let it be known I made it and I'm one of the first in the city

[Hook]
Yes, yes, y'all and you don't stop
To the beat y'all and you don't stop

[Verse 2: Logic]
I'm from Maryland where all the honeys is fine as Monroe
With bodies that make you want to come inside like the Commodores
The RattPack, sitting around the table playing blackjack
Three piece Armanis with the freshest snapbacks
You know its Logic, haters busting at us and we dodge it
Whether you're from the burbs or representing the projects
This that feel good flow, from the records to shows
To getting shorties out of they clothes, from DC to God knows
Young Sinatra, don't forget Logic taught you
King of the bobbysoxer, keeping it real since I first brought you
The flow that is inevitable, peace to Phil and Chris we go hard for the city we know
I'm on the come up, too many honeys on they Princess Leia trying to bun up
But that's a no go, I'm on my Han Solo in the city

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Phil Ade]
I love it like no other
Shine on the brightest summers, go out when the night is coupled
With stars, bar hoppers and clubbers
They not too fond of others
We'd hold each others hand and talk shit on demand, get stopped with gun in hand, blamnd
This is still the murder capital
Niggas will clap you for your shoe, money and jacket too
Dude, I've seen the toe-tagging ensue
'02' ain't the year where [?]
If black is beautiful, the city getting ugly now
We moving now, with the cost of living is shooting through the clouds
Wow, am I the only nigga noticing
Is the city half black, Mr. [?]
Fuck it, I'll be the youngin to bring the focus in
And the dopest since Rayful Edmond brought crack coke in
Think I ain't got the touch ask Tony Toca and
I'm high as the age rate, watch where you poke it in the city
