[Intro]
Yeah, yeah
Power 106
L.A. Leakers
Logic
Rattpack
We gon' jump into these bars

[Verse]
So many people think that rap is they calling, stop it just cease
Got it capiche? This is my house you fuckers just lease
Waitin' on a record deal that's never coming like a priest
Black and white like a nun
These up-and-comers our sun like the break of dawn
So follow your father like an apostle
Paint pictures like a Picasso while bitches uncover my fossil
Never knowing what's gon' follow
However we never wallow in our sorrow
Just pray for tomorrow
At times my heart could be hollow
Emotions forced to be swallowed
While neighborhood cats blast off gats like the Apollo
This is just a simple reminder as my lyrics force you to ponder
Life's a bitch and I heard she'll fuck you
So I'm trying to find her
One moment she'll love you then swallow
You whole like an anaconda
The bitch is kinky, kind of so with the lift of a pinky
I'mma dominate the world like my name was Brain
Spit flame like propane
Bitches I overcame you know the name
Ink in my veins, in flames, and spew on the page
To numb the pain like novacaine
Yeah
Allow me to kill it off the brake like no traffic
Murderin' every demographic
Paint a picture using only blood to make sure that it's graphic
Rip the mic to set the example
While all these mu-fuckers testin my patience like blood samples
Constant thoughts of suicide, we live in an era that's do or die
Society expects us to fail, I'm talking about you and I
But we persevere force feed enemies truth serum
We want, nothing but peace and if not we leave em deceased
In your central nervous system like heroin reppin' Maryland to the fullest
Bustin like bullets that travel through chambers ignited by triggers don't pull it
I get from point A to point B by keeping it G
Ain't no killer but don't push me
If you grab the heat you a pussy
Knuckle up and tell me how you feel, forget the steel
I have not a single enemy
Only evil entities that have some how befriended me, In they mind
Cuz I am just a mortal man of peace that can rhyme
And when it comes to planes I catch dames
They catch feelings
Haters keep my name in they mouth like fillings
High as the ceiling
Ya'll really don't know who your dealing with now
Visions of livin' until my flesh is perished and my spirit is risen
Thankful for every breath I'm giving
Fuck social division
That's how I'm living
What's the deal
Gotta keep it real
Now tell me how you feel
It's Logic
