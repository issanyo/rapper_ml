[Verse 1: Ansel Elgort]
I've been waiting a long time for a love like you, yeah
Going out on the town, drinkin' the night away
But I never found you, no I didn't
'Cause when I'm around you, yeah
The world seems so much sweeter than it was
The friends all around you, yeah, they say it's not
But we know that it's love

[Pre-Chorus: Ansel Elgort]
Baby, you can count on me
I'll be right there for you
I'll always adore you
My love will restore you
Baby, you can count on me
Count on me
Baby, you can count on me

[Chorus: Ansel Elgort]
Count on me
Baby, you can count on me
Count on me
Baby, you can count on-

[Verse 2: Logic]
And even though I'm giving you everything
I won't give into indecision
I'm always gon' be there, see my vision
And even though we got more issues than GQ
No matter what happens, it's always gon' be you, it's always gon' be you
It's mathematical, fuck all this division don't need sabbatical
As long as you can count than you can process the amount in which I'm living for you
Foot up on the gas, I'm your baby yeah I'm driven for you
Mind racing and my body pacing, but I'm in it for you (in it for you)
I've been on my own for too long, it's just you and I
Everything we ever talk about you know, is do or die
Any type of way you feeling right now, you can let it die
312 type of girl, why you always shy?
I can feel it happen the second I said it, don't let it get the best you
I'm just trying to bring out the best in you
I ain't testing you
I ain't telling you how to live
I'm just giving you everything I've got to give

[Pre-Chorus: Ansel Elgort]
Baby you can count on me
I'll be right there for you
I'll always adore you
My love will restore you
Baby, you can count on me
Count on me
Baby you can count on me

[Chorus: Ansel Elgort]
Count on me
Baby, you can count on me
Count on me
Baby, you can count on me

[Outro: Ansel Elgort & Logic]
Tell me how you feeling
Are you willing to keep going now?
Play me as the villain if you choose, but it's on nowGrew up on the east coast, Soho where it's going now
Baby you can count on me
If you wanna get it, we can do it like that now
I ain't finna back down
'Cause you can count on me

[Chorus: Ansel Elgort]
Baby, you can count on me
Count on me
Baby, you can count on me, yeah
Woah, yeah, oh
Baby you can count on, me
