Check it
We out in cali, chillin in this alley
'Bout to smoke this jack, never not a black
Half white, that's a fact
When I spit it I rip it, it's so ridiculous
They never understand it demand it why, because because
I'm rippin' and livin and strivin' to kill it
I gotta get it right now
This is how we do it, goddamn, homie check the style
I got this album coming out soon, October 21st
Be the first to rip the verse
I never spit this curse
But I curse, on a verse, yeah I got it
This is how we do it cause the flow is so hypnotic
Goddamn, L-O-G-I-C they know me out in L.A
Up in N.Y.C. and M.D. that is me
Yes it's every day
I'm kickin' it off the top, like I did back with Sway
And this is how we do it, RattPack all day
R-A-double T-P-A-C-K, B-O-double B-Y
They may not know the name
But they gon' know it when this fame
Comes to this
Dames, come to this
Second I spit it I run with this
Goddamn it's strictly off the top of the dome
It's off the topic, I never stop it
I never grip the mic unless I plan to drop it
After this fire
Spit a desire this is how we do it goddamn
Work for hire, this is how we do it
Can you feel it Rattpack Visionary
V's up all day
It's Logic
