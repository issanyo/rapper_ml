[Verse 1: Logic]
Yeah fast cars with iPods in them
Young Sinatra what they blastin like a beretta
V for Vendetta, bitches sit and play just to get wetter
Haters talking shit but then they study every letter
I'm the first draft pick with the last laugh bitch
See I'm angry on the track but I deserve to be
Cause all these rappers with no talent wanna murder me
People talking shit ain't even heard of me
I went from park benches at night, to first class flights
That's what you call takin' shit to new heights
Put the 750 in reverse like Benjamin Button
We've been doing it for years and they down all of a sudden

[Chorus: Logic]
Bobbysoxer doing 120 in the corvette
Watch your boy blow up in front of your eyes, war vet
Give a fan nothin' but fire, now they want more of it
Everybody want my album it ain't in stores yet

[Verse 2: Logic]
I keep it real all the time
Like my crew when I rhyme
Just a killer in his prime with that predator state of mind
I'm set to detonate
Stack my bread and watch the paper escalate
Don't test my fate, Logic finna blow like Mary Kate
I play my role like Shakespeare
RattPack ain't no fakes here
I conceal my talent like a 357
And ever since I was 11 I've been a G
Chillin' on the low key, incognito
Manipulate the steel like Magneto
Smacking suckers like mosquitoes
Dispersin' verses like a kilo
I'm Michael, the king, you fuckers is Tito
Versace frames with the green shades I only see dough
Balling like a free throw you know my steelo
I once was a prince with the vision of a king
Now I run the whole thing not defined by the bling
Exterminatin' fakes like crooked jakes killin' for high stakes
Guarantee it is my fate to be, remembered as one of the greats
No matter what it takes boy I'ma give it my all
Like Jordan when he balled, never stumbled never fall
Lyrical medicine
Repeat the formula until I get it right like Edison (Edison)
Now step into my mind as I calculate lyrics like Einstein
The way he manipulated numbers I manipulate the rhymes
Like E=MC squared, nah
E= Eater of emcees beware
Watch me shine in the darkness like a flare
Married to the game, I'm the heir to the throne you been watching

[Chorus: Logic]
Bobbysoxer doing 120 in the corvette
Watch your boy blow up in front of your eyes, war vet
Give a fan nothin' but fire, now they want more of it
Everybody want my album it ain't in stores yet

[Verse 3: Logic]
Walk into a room and they staring at a brother like
What up, whats the next move, should I improve
On some shit I never gave a fuck about before
Let relationships end up cause all I do is flow
See I'm a selfish motherfucker I already know
Don't try to tell me what I'm not
Bitch I'll conquer the globe
I sacrificed my whole childhood just to explode
I want this more than what's under Mila Kunis' robe
Meanwhile Daddy's lil' girl asking for more money
But little did he know the bread was for blow money
What's in store, money, sold out shows and hoes for me
I can't fade, this the only reason I was made
To follow my dreams and manipulate these rhyme schemes like a genius spittin' the meanest
I done seen this as a child 10,000 people in the crowd
Reppin' the RattPack watch 'em all go wild

[Outro: Logic]
Slicin' emcees like Vader
Motherfucking RattPack
You already know what it is
Yeah, Visionary Music group
V's up all day
Yeah, yeah, yeah
