[Verse 1: Ripsy May]
So just come fly son
And don't be shy son
I see you're hidin'
You're a man on the run
And if you don't feel like runnin'
I know the sun gone be shinin'
So stop all the cryin'

[Bridge]
Ohohoh, Ohohoh, Ohohoh

[Chorus: Ripsy May]
Boy you better run, run, run, maybe tonight
Boy you better run, run, run, run, run, outta my mind
Boy you better run, run, run, maybe tonight
Boy you better run, run, run, run, run, outta my mind

[Bridge 2: Ripsy May]
Ohoh oh-oh, Ohoh oh-oh, Ohoh oh-oh, Ohoh oh-oh, Ohoh oh-oh, Ohoh oh-oh, Ohoh oh-oh, Ohoh oh-oh

[Verse 2: Ripsy May]
So just before your time
And take your time son
And just come fly son
I see you're tryin' but you're just a man on the run
Ohoh oh-oh
You're just a man on the run
Ohoh oh-oh

[Verse 3: Logic]
Hol' up yes i know it now
Everybody wanna come around
Feel like i wanna dumb it down
Feel like i don't wanna come around
Now everybody wanna run, run
Now everybody wanna run around
I feel like I'm runnin' runnin'
I feel like I'm runnin' okay
My bobby, this city, this average life i live it
Respect but I just don't give it
And I really wanna wonder what is it
I hope that I visit, this paradise what is it
My vision is livid and I truly hope that I live it
Yeah

[Chorus: Ripsy May]
Boy you better run, run, run, maybe tonight
Boy you better run, run, run, run, run, outta my mind
Boy you better run, run, run, maybe tonight
Boy you better run, run, run, run, run, outta my mind

[Bridge 2: Ripsy May]
Ohoh oh-oh, Ohoh oh-oh, Ohoh oh-oh, Ohoh oh-oh, Ohoh oh-oh, Ohoh oh-oh, Ohoh oh-oh, Ohoh oh-oh

[Chorus: Ripsy May]
Boy you better run, run, run, maybe tonight
Boy you better run, run, run, run, run, outta my mind
Boy you better run, run, run, maybe tonight
Boy you better run, run, run, run, run, outta my mind

[Bridge 2: Ripsy May]
Ohoh oh-oh, Ohoh oh-oh, Ohoh oh-oh, Ohoh oh-oh, Ohoh oh-oh, Ohoh oh-oh, Ohoh oh-oh, Ohoh oh-oh
