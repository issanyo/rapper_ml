[Verse 1: Logic]
Ayo, let me get up, come and hit up
All this shit we [?]
What's the deal? Keep it real
'Bout to spit that mass appeal
What's the flavor, I'm your savior
'Bout to come, I feel the vibe
This is how we do it
Can you feel it comin' through the tribe?

[Verse 2: Joey Bada$$]
Uh, can you feel it? Man, I'm feelin' live
Any time I come up on the mic I spit a vibe
It's the feelin' that's inside that's in the song
And I feel it 'cause it's like liquid gold
You know I gotta get it and
It's a fire in my spirit, man
You gotta hear it and you never live it
And I spit the clearest
See my future clearer through the crystal ball
Niggas know I gotta never let this shit fall
I gotta…

[Verse 3: Logic]
I'm 'bout to… I'm 'bout to break up in this shit one time
I gots to murder the rhyme 'cause this shit is so divine
Can you feel this vibe? I am alive
And this is how I'm feelin', hella good
Rollin' through my hood, smokin' on that Backwood

[Verse 4: Joey Bada$$]
Yeah, we are alive, it's the best feelin'
I can't describe, it's just the way I'm wheelin' and I'm dealin'
And you see it, man I got it, through the roof, it's through the ceilin'
It's one hell of a feelin' for your teeth and Dr. Phillin'
And I'm good, uh

[Verse 5: Logic]
Up through the ceilin', it's a feelin', and I'm comin' rippin' rhymes
The second I spit it, I got it, I rip it all the time
L-O-G-I-C and Bada$$, that's how we get down
You know west side, we get down
Especially when we're rollin' through your town

[Verse 6: Joey Bada$$]
You say that's how we get down
Check the app, Bandsintown
We comin' around
And we got this shit surround sound
We gotta push it down
And we takin' the crowns
We gotta get it, it's the kings of the underground

[Verse 7: Logic]
Ayo, we goin' bar for bar, that's par for par
Everybody know who we are when we step up in the bar
Sippin' on that Scotch…

[Verse 8: Joey Bada$$]
And you know, star to star
We got battle scars
And we been through this before, man
We prayin' to the lords, it's the…

[Verse 9: Logic]
Yeah, that's true, when I come through
In a second, what it do?
And this is how we rockin' though, this is how I'm feelin'
Higher than the ceilin'…

[Verse 10: Joey Bada$$]
Yeah, you off the scotch and I'm off the wine
We livin' life, we just tryna find
Anything that be divine
I roll the light and you know I got it in mind
Nigga, put a fight…

[Outro: Logic & Joey Bada$$]
And then…I'm fucking lit
Yeah, you know we smokin' a lot, a lot (Aye!)
And my niggas never workin' no nine-to-five
We gotta get it man, thank God, I'm alive
Yo, this beat is crazy
Powers…
