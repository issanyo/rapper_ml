Coming up in the game, ain't never be the same
Fuck a album, drop the tape
Now they know your name
Ain't no need to sign a deal just to get the fame
So you're relying and these record labels wanna tame
Your art, the written, the grammar
Just to own your name
On the green, mine call it the road to fame
Remember when you was a little boy?
Hair brushed and your right here rapping in front of your toys?
And ever now and then it would get your momma annoyed
And even though you don't talk, she proud of you, boy
Remember when you were Shakespeare in the school play?
And she would make you memorize lines every day?
That's how you memorize rap lines to this day
And even though your father wasn't there, you had Jay
Nas, Pac, and Eminem
The play gettin' stronger every day
Thanks to Kanye
Started by touching the sky and now you on the moon
Writin' for hours every day inside of your room
I swear to God, if you keep it up, yeah it's coming soon
I swear to God, if you keep it, yeah it's coming soon
It's really hard when you're all alone
Thoughts racing inside of your dome
After three years, you and your girl split up
Woulda put a ring on that finger, but had to give up
And now you're ready to live up to your genius
While all these money hungry bitches on your [dick], yeah
And if you get it, you better never forget it, that I did it
Showed you how to hit it now you comin' in the game
So you better summit, give it your all if you really want it
Con-sole to the game, so you better run it
Yeah
