[Chorus: Dizzy Wright]
Blessed with all the dope talent
Pray they switch their techniques up
Drop so much they can't keep up
Losin' count, account balance
Seen the world and world peaced up
What's the squad without the deep one?
Rollin' weed I gotta keep one
'Cause life'll turn you to a savage
Blessed with all the dope talent
Pray they switch their techniques up
Drop so much they can't keep up
Losin' count, account balance
Seen the world and world peaced up
What's the squad without the deep one?
Rollin' weed I gotta keep one
'Cause life'll turn you to a...

[Verse 1: Dizzy Wright]
I used to think I didn't have it, but I never give up on a challenge
You say I can't do it, I go out and do it
I do what I want, don't ever get it backwards
You must been misinformed, I've been active and animated
Got the cameras waitin', I love myself just like I am
No transformations, I've been patient
Flyin' right under your radar, if you boss up you cannot be laid off
Fuck what they're sayin' they try me, talk all that shit behind me
This shit gon' pay off, the difference between me and them is
I don't take a fuckin' day off
So my nigga keep laughing while I'm givin' you classics
Back to back showin' compassion, thank God I'm-

[Chorus: Dizzy Wright]
Blessed with all the dope talent
Pray they switch their techniques up
Drop so much they can't keep up
Losin' count, account balance
Seen the world and world peaced up
What's the squad without the deep one?
Rollin' weed I gotta keep one
'Cause life'll turn you to a savage
Blessed with all the dope talent
Pray they switch their techniques up
Drop so much they can't keep up
Losin' count, account balance
Seen the world and world peaced up
What's the squad without the deep one?
Rollin' weed I gotta keep one
'Cause life'll turn you to a...

[Verse 2: Logic]
Tell me how you wanna get it like this
I've been down for a minute, can't fight this
Fuck around, yeah, you know I had to write this
Do it like this, do it, do it, do it just like this
Had to let 'em breathe
Yeah, you know that's the type of shit I need
I've been workin' like a maniac, oh, yeah
Yeah that boy finna get it all, yeah
Me and my homies, we all here, me and my homies been grindin'
In the studio we find 'em, yeah, you know that boy be shinin'
I'm spittin', I'm rhymin', remarkable timin', my flow, I think I know
Logic, he got it for sure, murdered this shit with the laziest flow

[Chorus: Dizzy Wright]
Blessed with all the dope talent
Pray they switch their techniques up
Drop so much they can't keep up
Losin' count, account balance
Seen the world and world peaced up
What's the squad without the deep one?
Rollin' weed I gotta keep one
'Cause life'll turn you to a savage
Blessed with all the dope talent
Pray they switch their techniques up
Drop so much they can't keep up
Losing count, account balance
Seen the world and world peaced up
What's the squad without the deep one?
Rollin' weed I gotta keep one
'Cause life'll turn you to a...
