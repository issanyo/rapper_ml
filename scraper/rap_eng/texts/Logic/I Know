[Verse 1: C Dot Castro]
Got me feeling like a million bucks
I'm so gassed cause all the ladies filling me up
I want it all and I know I'm gon' get it
So holla if you with it, let me hear you say

[Hook: Logic]
Hey
I know
I know, know, know I know
Baby I know

[Verse 2: C Dot Castro]
Whether you like white, brown or a combination of them
Nigga getcha getcha ass off the wall
I'm finna have a midget feeling six feet tall
And broke niggas feeling like they really can just ball
No worries in the world, hakuna matata
Just do what you gotta
Turn the rags to Gucci, Louis and Prada
If everyone got it all then we really got nada
We on the rise now watch a nigga levitate
Never graduated so we let the bitches educate
But you know we got our G.E.D's
Getting every dime when they see we be who we are
Got them looking from afar cause everybody want to be a star
This is C D-O-T Castro and Logic
Everything you never had till we got it
But we had to go and get it
So let me see your hands up

[Hook: Logic]

[Verse 3: Logic]
That you got what it takes to make it
I'm not talking ass baby girl don't shake it no
We gon' ride today, we gon' ride today
If you really want to get it I'm with it never hit it and quit it
Baby girl know this now
Take you to the crib lay you down, get wild
Girl tell me what it really is, I'm too smart for your mind games
Check the name that's my game
Now I'm heading towards more fame
Ultimately resulting in more brain
Ultimately resulting in more chains and more things that I don't give a fuck about
Steer clear got to keep my eyes on the route
It's real hard I'm only human, we all doubt
So it's time to rhyme
Hungry as a motherfucker ramadan
Now you know it's on
I'm gone

[Hook: Logic]
