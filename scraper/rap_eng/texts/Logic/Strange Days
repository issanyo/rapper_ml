[Intro: Sade]
"You're acting strange, what's going on?"
"Reach for the top
And the sun is gonna shine"
What up Lenny?

[Verse 1: Big Lenbo]
Tell 'em make room for another broke rapper
Revenant of the boom, bare witness with trappers
No capital step to quiet as kept
One false move straight to the neck like Gillette
Teachers pet, got the arms up on the dummies
Class clown niggas still think something funny
Assed out bully coming for the lunch money
No bread yet why I'm still acting crummy
No address why I'm still lookin' bummy
No bitches calling, they don't want that from me
Strange days, I'm in 'em got my heart pumping venom
Got my head full of tension, got my life all in question
Wander through the maze still looking for the lesson
Wonder why my age be the only thing progressing
Gutter motherfucker, feel nothing but aggression
Piece of shit really can't stand his own reflection

[Chorus: Sade (Sampled)]
Reach for the top
And the sun is gonna shine
Every winter was a war she said
I want to get what's mine

[Scratches]

[Verse 2: Lenbo]
What you putting out don't come back right exact
Better watch your own back, that's a matter of fact
That karma prove untrue to the rule
Don't get fooled or screwed by what you thought you knew
Twisted from the angst, still doing what it takes
Steadily intake, tryna cut the bitter taste
Feels so familiar but you never seen this place
Focus to deliver anytime post-haste
Promised I'm a winner and the fam can't wait
Been too many winters now it's set to detonate
Took too many shorts in my life to contemplate
Scores need to settle so the pressure can escape
Strange place to be in but it's strange to be at all
If you wanna take the call gotta learn to take the fall
Boss up and take the charge ante up and play the cards
Roll the dice, love life, get down and move forward
Strange days

[Scratches]

[Chorus: Sade (Sampled) & Big Lenbo]
Reach for the top
And the sun is gonna shine
Every winter was a war she said
I want to get what's mine

[Outro: Sade (Sampled)]
Reach for the top
And the sun is gonna shine
Reach for the top
And the sun is gonna shine
Every winter was a war she said
I want to get what's mine
