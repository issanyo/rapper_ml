[Verse 3: Logic]
Money, Money, Money, Money
You know if I got, they won't take it from me
But if I don't get it you know they won't love me
Can't do what I love
No I can't do what I love
Need that when push come to shove
That's why my brother selled drugs
Call me the plug
Living like I never had it
Momma was an addict
Listen to the static
In the streets, ithen I added to the beats
Money make the world go round
Money make a girl go down like..
That is a lie
Come now boy open your eyes
You hipnotised by
To me the more money we make
The sooner get greedier
Sooner get greedier
Now, stop it just do what you love
Come now just do what you love
Just do what you love
Come now just do what you love
Come now just do what you, do what you, do what you love
No for the money
Say no for the womans
Say no for the car and the clothes that you love
Come now just do what you love
Come now just do what you, do what you, do what you love
