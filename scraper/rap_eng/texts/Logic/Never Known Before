Full lyrics will be available when the song is released

[Chorus]
She's a pretty young girl, doin' pretty young things
She's a pretty young lady, pullin' at my heartstrings
Pretty young girl, take my hand
I'll be your man, I'll be your man
I don't think you know, all the things you do to me
It's new to me, it's all the things I've never known before
I don't think you know, all the things you do to me
It's new to me, it's all the things I've never known before (before)

[Verse 1]
I'm fucked up, I mean, I really am hurt
You knew when you're beautiful
But experience tells me this ain't gonna work
You're just like all the rest, suffering in disguise
Behind those beautiful eyes, lies, lies, and I
Just don't wanna pretend, I just can't do it again
But if that shit was true, maybe we'll be friends
My heart can't take no more, I'm sincerely sure
But if that shit was true, why in the hell am I singing for?

[Chorus]
Pretty young girl, doin' pretty young things
She's a pretty young lady, pullin' at my heartstrings
Pretty young girl, take my hand
I'll be your man, I'll be your man (tell 'em!)
I don't think you know, all the things you do to me
It's new to me, it's all the things I've never known before
I don't think you know, all the things you do to me
It's new to me, it's all the things I've never known before (before)

[Verse 2]
Nah, shawty, I don't have no free time
Gave her all my everything, ain't never had no me-time
Too scared to commit, no, don't want no rewind
I could give a fuck what the world think, we fine
I've been feelin' shook, don't know where to look
Last girl got me sprung, throughout my black book
Nah, I ain't got no Rolodex, but I ain't lookin' back though
I ain't jumpin' back up in the game, show me the backdoor
I ain't got no time for thots, that shit is a bad idea
I don't have no time for hoes, I only want a good girl who knows
Had to get wild with it, started out shy wit' it
Like she from the 3-1-2 till I hit it
Shorty know your limit, get up in it
Yeah, I'm good, I'm good, I'm good

[Chorus]
And she's a pretty young girl, doin' pretty young things
She's a pretty young lady, pullin' at my heartstrings
Pretty young girl, take my hand
I'll be your man, I'll be your man
I don't think you know, all the things you do to me
It's new to me, it's all the things I've never known before
I don't think you know, all the things you do to me
It's new to me, it's all the things I've never known before (before)
