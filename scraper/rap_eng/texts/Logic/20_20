[Intro: Lungz]
Yeah, uh, uh, uh, uh

[Verse 1: Lungz]
I am legend, legendary position
Vision blurry behind the wheel of my drugs’ prescription
Got no love for these bitches
Got no love for these niggas
They don’t fit the description
They distorting my friction
My addiction is money
Undeniable habit
I'm still writing my story laid out with something Spanish
She fucked me like a demon got her speaking in tongues
We on the roof overlooking the city I’m from
All the places I’ve been many places I hung
Same shit that I spit
Same shit that I slung
This is more than just life they ain’t doing it right
I’m just writing my wrongs 20/20 in sight

[Hook: Lungz]
Yeah, I got that 20/20 vision I can see the money clearer
I was wrong was before now I’m right (I'm right)
Watch me bang and fuck the picture
It’s just me and all my niggas and my bitches
My niggas the life (the life)
It's the life (It's the life)
It's the life (It's the life)
It's the life (It's the life)
It's the life (It's the life)
It's the life (It's the life)
It's the life (It's the life)
It's the life (It's the life)
It's the life

[Verse 2: Logic]
Drop top with a couple bad bitches in the back of the 'Lac
You know the deal, let me get it up RattPack, how we live it up
Little bit of Hennessy up in the cup
All up in the cut, motherfucker what
Maryland what I be repping the moment I step in
I’m killing this shit
Killing and killing this shit
Yeah, fast cars, bad hoes, fuck that, I got mad shows
I guess this is the life that God chose
Finally high, but I been low
I got vision, boy, that’s 20/20
Getting paid, but man, fuck the money
It’s that real recognize real
Tell me how you feel
Say they gotta lot of money, but they never seen a mil’
Grip the steel but they never kill
All they do is grill
I just keep posting up with my homies
Man we got different blood, but you know we fam
Living my life till the fullest by keeping it real
Yeah you know I am

[Hook: Lungz]
Yeah, I got that 20/20 vision I can see the money clearer
I was wrong was before now I’m right (I'm right)
Watch me bang and fuck the picture
It’s just me and all my niggas and my bitches
My niggas the life (the life)
It's the life (It's the life)
It's the life (It's the life)
It's the life (It's the life)
It's the life (It's the life)
It's the life (It's the life)
It's the life (It's the life)
It's the life (It's the life)
It's the life

[Verse 3: Lungz]
One time for my niggas in the go right
North side and you know where I’m from right
Like you ain't never really know right
Niggas shy till I put 'em in a low light
Might have to ride around in your side of town
With my music up If I wake your neighbors and they start complaining I don’t give a fuck
Got 20/20 no specs on
Rear view nigga get lost
Blue print now I gotta plan
Fuck a Traffic jam I just drive thru it
Fuck the bullshit I learn to slide through it
Lungz with Logic you don’t want a problem
Fuck the progress they just digest be silent no violence
Big dollars I digest you put a topic no subject
Less was more, more was less big picture more success
Vision blurred I'm focus you hopeless and you know this
I'mma keep rhyming till I’m homeless I’m chosen and you know this

[Hook: Lungz]
Yeah, I got that 20/20 vision I can see the money clearer
I was wrong was before now I’m right (I'm right)
Watch me bang and fuck the picture
It’s just me and all my niggas and my bitches
My niggas the life (the life)
It's the life (It's the life)
It's the life (It's the life)
It's the life (It's the life)
It's the life (It's the life)
It's the life (It's the life)
It's the life (It's the life)
It's the life (It's the life)
It's the life (It's the life, It's the life)
