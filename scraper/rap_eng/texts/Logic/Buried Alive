[Chorus]
Tell me how you feel (Tell me how you feel)
I feel like the grass is green
And everything I do is unseen
But I know that’s just in my mind
I know everything is just in my mind
Do you really wanna be famous?
Do you really wanna be a superstar?
Do you really wanna get dangerous?
Do you even know where the groupies are?
Bitches out here be shameless
And I really wonder where they parents are
Look around, everything changes
It feels like I've been buried alive
Buried alive

[Verse 1]
Everything happens for a reason
Happens for a reason
People only in your life for seasons
Word to Aunt Viv (Real shit)
Uh, death and taxes that’s all we given
You can make a life but can’t make a livin'
You can make it work but that still ain't driven
Give a lot but that still ain't givin'
Livin' life like this ain’t real though
Every night like this I feel so dead wrong
Collision is head on, my vision is dead and gone
Perception of right and wrong
I been here so very long right here in this very song, uh
Look around everything changes
Seem like everybody just strangers
Don’t go outside 'cause it’s dangerous
Why everybody wanna be famous
I’m so OCD, if they notice me
I might jump out the grave so they know it’s me
Man, everybody want this shit for free
Hand out, palm up when they get to me
In my mind, no, I never let it get to me
Everybody got a time, will it get to me?
V’s up motherfucka, that’s victory
Tell me why what I’m doing ain’t shit to me, damn

[Pre-Chorus]
Buried alive (Buried alive)
Will I survive? (Buried alive)
I gotta know
Know, know, know, know, know, know, know, know, know, know, know
I gotta know
Know, know, know, know, know, know, know, know, know, know, know, know, know, know
It feels like I’ve been buried alive
Buried alive

[Chorus]
Tell me how you feel (Tell me how you feel)
I feel like the grass is green
And everything I do is unseen
But I know that’s just in my mind
I know everything is just in my mind
Do you really wanna be famous?
Do you really wanna be a superstar?
Do you really wanna get dangerous?
Do you even know where the groupies are?
Bitches out here be shameless
And I really wonder where they parents are
Look around, everything changes
It feels like I've been buried alive
(Let it breathe)

[Verse 2]
I'm feelin' this villainous feelin' inside of my mind
Every time that I’m willing I feel like I'm killin' my dreams
When that voice goes nah, nah, nah
Listen up now, love it or hate it
Never debate it, you can never degrade it
While all these other motherfuckers
Probably thinking I made it
My mind jaded, no—I never evade it
I elevate it just to keep it innovative (innovative)
God damn, bring it back now, blowin' up like Iraq now
RattPack put me on the map now
No, we never back down
Just take my time, I just take my time
I know, I'ma get it like this
So everyone know that I did it like this
Yeah, I know—I'ma take my time
Battle the image inside of my mind
I know, I'ma keep going
Tell me I can't but I'm already knowing
I know, I'm gonna rise even though I've been—

[Pre-Chorus]
Buried alive (Buried alive)
Will I survive? (Buried alive)
I gotta know
Know, know, know, know, know, know, know, know, know, know, know
I gotta know
Know, know, know, know, know, know, know, know, know, know, know, know, know, know
It feels like I’ve been buried alive
Buried alive

[Chorus (Condensed)]
Tell me how you feel (Tell me how you feel)
I feel like the grass is green
And everything I do is unseen
But I know that’s just in my mind
I know everything is just in my mind
(Let it breathe)

[Outro: Thalia]
