[Man]
Look, I know there have been a lot of mistakes
And we both made them
I apologize for my part in that
And all that said, nonsense in the past
I don't give a shit about that anymore

[Woman]
You always want what you want when you want it
Why is everything so urgent with you?

[Man]
Let me tell you something
This here, right now, at this very moment
That's all that matters to me
That's urgent like a motherfucker
