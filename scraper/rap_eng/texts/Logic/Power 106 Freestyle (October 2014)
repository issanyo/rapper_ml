[Intro]
Oh, okay
Damn
Alright, check it check it check it
I said "Hey now, brother!"
Check it check it check it check it check it

[Verse 1]
L-O-G-I-C, all up in this vicinity
You know it's me
This is how we do it all day, god damn
Can you feel it
All up in the spirit
I could do it, LA, hell yeah
Let me get it for the Bay
From the M, to the D, to the NYC
This is how we do it
Bout to kick this free off the top
This is how we do it all the time
I just kicked Nicky in the fucking face, god damn
Can you feel it when I'm all up in the place
Gotta do it right now, gotta do it right now
When I spit it, no you know I'm never lost
Hold up, tell me Big, how much does a pie cost?
Let me get it, let me spit it
Let me bring it back like this
We having a good time, design this rhyme
I spit random thought off the top of my mind
God damn, can you feel it
Yes I got it, feeling hella good
I got no driver's license but you know I'm driven
The second I spit it, everything you know is what I'm giving
Yeah I get it off the top, T-O-P, I gotta say it
I spray it, never delay it
The second I made it there, god damn
Imma get it on, gotta get it on
Gotta spit it, I get it, I rip it
Can you feel it now
Like I'm Jamaican, "I'm spitting off the top, brotha"
God damn let me get it, word to your mother
I'm having fun, gotta do it
Never never packed a gun
Cause I spit it off the top, like a ton, god damn
Yeah I gotta do it one time
Def Jam, VISA
This is how we do it, ease up
Please up, can you feel it all up in my spirit
It doesn't even matter random thought
This decision, I get a second incision
I spit it, and this is how we do it
Yeah I gotta get it
Never regret it the second I said it
It's so fucking pathetic
You edit, get murdered
You predict and bring it back again
Half white half black again
This is all they wanna talk about
And yeah, I'm [?]
I got Crystal B to the right
Louis G to the left
Everything is out of sight
And I'm going off Under Pressure, October 21st
Already came out, gotta spit this free verse
Strictly off the top
I never drop, never stop
Oh, god damn
Go to Best Buy and fucking cop
Get the physical
This is how we do it so medicinal
No I'm never smoking but your girl is choking on a dick
Woo! Sorry about that
Let me bring it back
Can you feel it, god damn, god damn
I could go on for days and days
Never delays and -lays
This is how we do it spit it
Think I need some sun rays

[Verse 2]
I been in the house too long just spitting this
Let me change up the beat, yeah I'm ripping this
I got it on
You know you got it on the ones and the twos
Doing what-it-do's
I'm from Maryland
In your system like heroin
This is how we do it
Can you feel it when I'm staring and
I'm going and going
I'm flowing and flowing
I'm flipping and libbing
I'm striving to kill in the rap
I gotta get it right now
When I do it, when I got it
When we quit
You want me to stop?
Should I stop?
Should I keep going?
Should I keep flowing?
Never knowing the direction in which I'm going
I spit it, I got it
I gotta get it, god damn

[Hook: Power 106]
And you don't, and you don't, and you don't
And you don't, and you don't, and you don't
And you don't, and you don't, and you don't
And you don't, and you don't stop

[Verse 3]
My favorite song of all time is what?
Something by Wu-Tang
Or maybe Ice Cube - It Was A Good Day
This is all I gotta say
Yeah you know the deal
Yeah you know the deal, how I feel
I could keep going and going
And going and going and going on
This is how we do it till the break of dawn
God damn, I was in New York yesterday
Now I'm in LA, I just don't know what to say
I'm feeling so damn good
Feeling so damn fine
Like Mos Def and Brooklyn in a bar
West in park, come out after dark
That's where the murder start
Now let me stop, let me stop
Let me keep it going
This is how we do it
Switch the beat up again
Switch the beat up again, c'mon

[Hook]

[Verse 4]
Check it, check it
Let me keep it up
This is how we do it
Let me beat it up
I'm feeling this feeling this vibe
This shit is hella crazy
You never amaze me
I'm never feeling lazy
Like I said, this is random thought
The shit that can't be taught
It's just emotional
I never provoke it
I spit it never choke it
God damn listen
No 8 Mile, B-Rabbit
The second I spit it
I gotta have it
I gotta do it
Never dab it like my homie
[?] at the crib
This is how we do it
Put it in the bitch's rib
Everything I got that's what I'm 'finna get
But my queen, she's a beauty
This is how we do it
God damn such a cutie
Let me spit it
Yeah, she's sweet like five stars
I gotta get it right now
I'm kinda hungry boutta' hit Five Guys (pause)
I'm just fucking around
Let me get it, no beef
Nah, we squash that
This is how we do it
We 'bout the lettuce, toss that
God damn it's so crazy
Such a particular case
My man Louis G look like he just came back from outer space
This is much more than a hare race
You're moving at a snail's pace
God damn, I'm just switching the flow, never know
Half white, half negro
You know we gotta spit it that's fo' sho'
I love who I am
Love who I ain't
This is how we do it
Let me spit it
Just let me paint the picture
The second I get richer
I get bigger
Can you feel it the second I got it
I got six figures and commas
I never pause though
Unless I need it
This is how we do it
That's word of Anita
We need to bring it back
I love the beat
Let's go again, let's go again
Let's go again, c'mon

[Hook]

[Verse 5]
Check it, check it
Let me spit it like this is so ridiculous
God damn, I know you feel it
Wu-Tang hit you with the killer beat
God damn, that's my thing
When I spit it, when I sing
Oh my god, going crazy
It never does amaze me
Never lazy
When I spit it off the top
The topic is hella awesome
