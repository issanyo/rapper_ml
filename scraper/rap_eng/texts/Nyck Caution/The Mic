[Verse 1: A La $ole]
Well, it's the miggity-mac daddy bringin' the boom up in yo' system
Sickest nigga in the village, rhythm flowin' like a river
Makin' 'em shiver, sendin' chills down they spine and liver
Hello Mr. Soul Spitter, what can I get 'cha
That player list arithmetic physician that'll split they bridges
Crossin' over like the point guard, maybe even Fisher
While the fishing for the nets, gettin' in yo' bed is your filet mignon
Um, a nigga just wanna bone
'Til I see she screamin' that harmony
We teachin' them two steps, I'm teachin' choreography
Pardon me, I'm supercalifragilisticexpialidocious
Nastier than Nas, is sicker than yo' halitosis
This rap shit, I body the mostest
[?] was splitting C's like a nigga was Moses
Nigga we own this
I roam around, like a nigga was Caesar
Taking virginities willingly cause a nigga we seize her
Man, it's a damage with promatic Spanish
Just know, the Prodies never fall
Make you see God after the clips like a nigga was madness
Them niggas was savage
Ain't shit funny, I'm on my mad shit
We gettin' mad chips, so I suggest you lay down
And get the static, I am estatic
Kill the game, I been this savage
Just fanatic, when we rappin' 'bout mad shit
[?] tricked us
Stickin' my dick inside yo' bitch lips'
Cause I'm the [?] of the motherfuckin' realest

[Verse 2: Nyck Caution]
I'm a carnivore, surfin' with a longer board
Waves with some sharks and they starvin' for your alma more
Kansas soda pop, blast it on you hoes
I'm a bastard with these flows
Kill it after out the hole
I gotta street sweeper for you leech squeezers
Angry like each beaver chillin' with a deep fever
Fahrenheit 'bout 103, you know me
The flow got you leanin' like you OD'd on codeine
And I ain't be with people who ain't with this
So either you gon' ride or you watchin' from a distance, getting AIDs
Cause you know they never failin' him
So if you aliens are acting ambient I'll throw you in an ambulance
Le-let the sirens ring 'til they blast
I'm a fuckin' addict, they keepin' stashes in my attic
A static shock, I'd rather rock out
The top down, and I'm 'bout to make it to the top now
Era over everything you reppin'
The E is for the earth and the energy we spreadin'
It's effortless, cause you know I'm better than yo' record list
The message is that you ain't forgettin' this, yeah

[Verse 3: Rokamouth]
The connections are hold, I might as well be the general
Sit on top of your world, my ass off a pedestal
Laid back cat just be puffin' on some medical
So I can avoid the chance of cancer on my testicals
To live life long and add some dollars to these decimals
Movin' like I'm flexible to look out for the rest of them
You know it's truth, you see me do everything with steez
And I know you all peep
We've been climbin' through some trees
And my life is my job so I'm livin' for that green
And I spit it with the team
We workin' off favors
And we all workin' hard and we tryna make that paper
And the Era's gettin' love to even see any haters
I roll it up for later
I sounded like Darth Vader
After smoke come out my mouth after puffin' off that vapor
