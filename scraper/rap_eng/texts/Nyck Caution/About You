VERSE:
Damn
Man, its hard as fuck to be faithful
But not hard enough cause I'm able
Even though they know that I'm labeled. But
Don't be flirtin' with a bitch that's undeserving
And wife unless you know that she's the type that's really worth it
Got a bad bitch and I am. Hard dick supply, damn
I got that girl
Oh shit, I lied den
Nah I can't do it. But this bitch got those curves
When she drop that I urge. I ain't got no words
She make her way to my lap and her pants start to unbutton
In a trance with all this lust
No romance
We just fucking
Second chance, I know I had a couple more than that
We ain't a couple we just struggle holdin' back
Got a newgirl that I want
We been friends for all this time. I know that it's a crime that were not one
As I spit the realest lines a reflection of my mind
Did I mention she's the only one I love?
But how I break this news to my other chick, the one that I been ridin' with
And how about the one I been lying with
I just feel like shit, above all of it
Now it's hard for me to smile
This the truest shit I ever typed and this is how my life be
I know that some of you make not like me
Based on half truths, trust me I feel bad too
A change
Yeah I'll be glad boo
But we don't forget but we forgive
And I'm haunted by these burdens and all these women who are pissed
They never understood that I don"t wife cause I like you
Despite what the rumors say I might do
I gotta get away and there's my flight boo
So tonight is the night. To make up for your past
Don't fight it if it's right


BRIDGE:
I know you got hurt before
But I don't want to hurt you
And I know you don't think it could work no more and that I don't deserve you
But can we make it through this
Girl, you on my mind thinking all the time
And I don't wanna go without you
Every song is about you, This ABOUT YOU
