[Verse 1: Nyck Caution]

Can't relinquish shit
I'm a delinquent, bitch
Juvenile with a stupid smile
I gotta troop it out
Hip hop is back
Say it twice fam
Hit the lights, damn
I'm about to sprite slam
Any ho that bystand with light tans
Put it out for my people, let me bite, damn
Shit, in the name of christ
Can you please get down for the night like you out for the fight
So party in the bassin
Bottles by the dresser
Hoes in the basement and O's by the checkers
Scroller with a swisher we gone blow through these letters
With an "l" to the dome got me stoned under pressure
I'm a diamond, dressed in this diamond
Used to be with diamond
I tried to get behind it, but now I keep it private
Get up out my face with you talk
You disgracing the York while I'm saving the sport, lawd
Breaking teen, adolescent fiend
But a flow so hard, can't paddle in my stream
Got loud coming through the speaker
Now that I can spit, got you shouting for a feature
Hit the mic record, let my life restore
Swinging fire every track like we light the sword
Its been a while since I black but its like before
Straight crack in your system like the white you snort I'm back
Yeah, and it was all just a plan to get my people up the pedestal
Surrounded by fans
Government collect all out revenue and start up the chants its LP
Yeah, tell 'em again (LP)
I'm surrounded by this excellence
Day I see my record spin
Dim on the floor I seen the lit
My style busting
We gone trespass
Swaggin', but with less class
Dressed like a celebrity
In the flesh then rapping on them
Take that plunge now
My shit is dumb loud
As I'm doing father
I've inquired all these sons now
But he put you up for an adoption
Never playing opposum, I promise I got them
Lies in the air
Why you speaking what you don't know
I'm breathing out my lungs out
But my (?) though
While I hear these speakers blasting crap
You a front, false ever toddler, but rap getting paid in full
While I'm just a raging bull
(?) Sinatra
Tell me do I look afraid to you
Nah, I be fearless doobies to the dome
And you know I can't feel shit

[Outro]
Man, I said I can't feel shit
Can you feel this
I swear you can't
