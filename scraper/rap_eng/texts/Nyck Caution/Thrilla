[Pre-Chorus: Aaron Rose]
Too many niggas think that I will never be able to hold myself my nigga
But I was taught to never knock the [?] block and try to stain my wealth my nigga
We still getting money, I know you feeling funny
Everything I do is only for me, so I can’t help it if they love me

[Chorus: Aaron Rose]
Feel like the Thrilla in Manila, we like heavyweights
The realest niggas from the city, Brooklyn born and raised
Feel like the Thrilla in Manila, we like heavyweights
The realest niggas from the city, Brooklyn born and raised, yeah

[Verse 1: Aaron Rose]
It’s been a while since I really spoke
Never thinking out loud but I’m finna go
Send Jack on the track, shit is critical
Give it through the halls when I talk like Arsenio
'Cause I got some niggas thinking I'ma really flop
Hov wasn’t the realest until B.I.G. stopped
Y’all be cooking on the stove but I'm really hot
Sickest with the flow so you knows it was really snot
It’s my time and I will not stop
I got a stock full of bread, so the pigeons a flock
I got a squad so ill that we still ain’t drop
So just wait for the wake, that’s a millie a pop
I’m saying none of you niggas is fucking with us
Fuck a Ike, I beat the beat up Tina looking to fuck
I been slaughtering daughters, ménageing with twins
Throw 'em back to the sea when I fin
Like the sign of the Pisces, I'm swimming
Stroke back stroking bitches, I’m drowning in women
You niggas ain’t nothing
I explode like it’s Nagasaki, when I’m in the throat
I ain’t copping choppas, I ain’t copping flows
I just put on for my niggas like it’s clothes
I been shining so bright while you niggas stroke
Fuck a light bulb, my electric flow
We shocking niggas so they know the pain
When they stay in the field like it’s Notre Dame
I know Roc-a-fellas, I say no to Dame
I got Pro propellers, we be over planes
Them other niggas be way over played
Call me Cobain when I splatter brains
Free Brisco, yeah that’s the gang
Better let 'em loose before we break the chain

[Pre-Chorus: Aaron Rose]
Too many niggas think that I will never be able to hold myself my nigga
But I was taught to never knock the [?] block and try to stain my wealth my nigga
We still getting money, I know you feeling funny
Everything I do is only for me, so I can’t help it if they love me

[Chorus: Aaron Rose]
Feel like the Thrilla in Manila, we like heavyweights
The realest niggas from the city, Brooklyn born and raised
Feel like the Thrilla in Manila, we like heavyweights
The realest niggas from the city, Brooklyn born and raised, yeah

[Verse 2: Nyck Caution]
Lo and behold, I get the vision, all that manifest it
Not because it was given, I hit the gas to get it
I’m Iverson with this practice shit, not to act pretentious
It’s like I’m born with this rhythm, this ain’t no accident it's
Nyck flicked the wrist, I took a risk
What a life, it’s been paying off ever since
Yeah of course, it’s been some forks in the road
Tried to tell me no but I ain’t listen
They told me I should sit in the back
Sitting complacently comfortable, I was starved
And now I replace steak for the lunchables, that they tried to give me
Tried to treat it like if I didn’t eat what they presented, I would never eat
Not the type to ever taste what I didn’t have to hunt for
I rather save my appetite and bite when I get it right
Giving you advice, reach don’t let anybody limit you in life
You know I got to reach for the stars, rip through the sky
Thrilla in Manila, the greatest of all time
Flow like a butterfly, hover like the mother ship
I’ll be in the clouds if anybody was wondering
Used to shoot me down, laughed at all my undiscovered shit
But you ain’t dreaming big if nobody making fun of it

[Pre-Chorus: Aaron Rose]
Too many niggas think that I will never be able to hold myself my nigga
But I was taught to never knock the [?] block and try to stain my wealth my nigga
We still getting money, I know you feeling funny
Everything I do is only for me, so I can’t help it if they love me

[Chorus: Aaron Rose]
Like the Thrilla in Manila, we like heavyweights
The realest niggas from the city, Brooklyn born and raised
Feel like the Thrilla in Manila, we like heavyweights
The realest niggas from the city, Brooklyn born and raised, yeah

[Outro: Aaron Rose]
Too many niggas think that I will never be able to hold myself my nigga
But I was taught to never knock the [?] block and try to stain my wealth my nigga
We still getting money, I know you feeling funny
Everything I do is only for me, so I can’t help it if they love me
Feel like the Thrilla in Manila, we like heavyweights
The realest niggas from the city, Brooklyn born and raised
Feel like the Thrilla in Manila, we like heavyweights
The realest niggas from the city, Brooklyn born and raised, yeah
