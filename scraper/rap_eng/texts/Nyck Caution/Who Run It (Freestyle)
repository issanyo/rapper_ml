[Intro]
Yeah yeah, here we go
Break the walls down, feel like Jericho
(It's fucking Nyck Caution you filthy motherfuckers)

[Verse]
Make moves in a [?]
Take two but the business barely done
They tried to lock me down but I ain't scared of none
I might drop the whole catalog
All for free, they don't pay me none
[?] they don't pay me none
[?]
Been in tune since I was very young
You would never recognize the pain
And you could never go and vandalize the name
Buff it out and sanitize the stain
Clean it up, it doesn't go away
That shit only ever fosters rage
Look at me like how could I complain
Respect to y'all, I feel like [?]
He'll turn [?]
[?]
Young godfather I'm pulling strings
God body, this a higher power
Who run it? Y'all know the name (Caution)
Tour soon with the Zombie Gang
I'm hell bound, I ignite the flame
Murder beats cause I'm not nice
No control I just hydroplaned
Shout out to Herbo
[?] we play 2K
Wanna smoke that shit one and done
Play the kid you get 21'd
Real facts, I don't fabricate
I been tryna eat, you don't pass the plate
Now you acting like you mad or something
I'm not really tryna brag or nothing
But y'all really don't comparing none
Dropping shit, I don't care to bump it
All my shows look like [?]
In the pit I'll be there to crash it
All your sets are just bare fuck shit
So when they ask who run it, it's me
Don't speak unless you done it
Better so please just shut up

[Outro]
Who run it?
Who run it?
Who run it?
Who run it?
Who run it?
Who run it?
Who run it?
Who run it?
