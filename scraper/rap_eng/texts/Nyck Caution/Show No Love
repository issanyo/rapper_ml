(Ain’t no love up in the city) x7
Hey, yo..

[Intro: Nyck Caution]
Cause there's no love up in the city, yeah
And I ain’t really tryna single it out
But it’s a fact that this shit been getting gritty, yeah
We gotta make it out alive
But you know these motherfuckers stay missing
Another day another pill man
So you know the deal man
They be pain killing, yeah
Ain’t no love if you ain’t wit it
Ain’t no love up in the city
But I’ve been for the freedom
I’m for the love
I’m tryna trust everybody that I’m with but it’s all fucked up
(But it’s all fucked up)
I said it’s all fucked up
(Yo it’s all fucked up)
Yo, you know I’m for the freedom
I’m for the love
I’m tryna trust everybody that I’m with
But it’s all fucked up
(But it’s all fucked up)
I said it’s all fucked up
Ain’t no love up in the city

[Verse 1: Nyck Caution]
Ain’t no love up in the city when you tryna be the next out
Everybody gunning for the same spot
And it’s the same old shit got me stressed out
Yeah, my brothers sniffing and he tell me that he can’t stop
Just another raindrop, (Yeah)
Till the pain stop, (Yeah)
Short living cause you know the side effects ain't pleasing
New York is the city of dreams, because we sleeping and these people ain’t impressed that easy
I ain’t worried bout nothing I ain’t involved with
Making sure that we get it got em honest
Got this city on my back
Told my people I would honor those who got me so I either break my promise or my collarbone
So let it go, I ain’t letting it fly
Let us build unless you wanna let intelligence die
We be underneath the surface I ain’t telling a lie
From the coast that don’t ever provide
Cause there's no love up in the city, yeah

[Hook: Nyck Caution]
And I ain’t really tryna single it out
But it’s a fact that this shit been getting gritty, yeah
We gotta make it out alive
But you know these motherfuckers stay missing
Another day another pill man
So you know the deal man
They be pain killing, yeah
Ain’t no love if you ain’t wit it
Ain’t no love up in the city
But I've been for the freedom
I’m for the love
I’m tryna trust everybody that I’m with but it’s all fucked up
I said it’s all fucked up
Yo, yo you know I’m for the freedom
I’m for the love
I’m tryna trust everybody that I’m with
But it’s all fucked up
I said it’s all fucked up
Ain’t no love up in the city, ain’t no love up in the

[Bridge: Kirk Knight]
Show no love
Kill the competition
Make a name
Young boy
On a mission
Everyday I pray
Show no love
Kill the competition
Make a name
Young boy
On a mission
Everyday I slay


[Verse 2: Kirk Knight]
Uh, ain’t no love up in the city, stare at mirrors counting O’s
Even options lookin' dimmer, lookin' deep through my pores
Pour my heart out on the stage
Ain’t no love if I flaw, flaw with me
Hostility, feel it in my bones, tinglin' my spinal cord
And life lines on it make the feeling more
But the more merrier keep me more focused, on the love
Never show the hand that's dealt, keep the cat up off the skunk
Tricks up my sleeve, treat my niggas that’s involved
Tryna stand tall in the city deep in these situations
But I never put my hands out
Life’s a roller-coaster, never keep my hands out
Climb the ladder of success, so a nigga stand out
Nighttime motherfucker, niggas always creep about
And the city never sleep
Tried to grab you by your mouth
And a nigga free to speak
So you gonna hear it loud

[Hook: Nyck Caution]
And I ain’t really tryna single it out
But it’s a fact that this shit been getting gritty, yeah
We gotta make it out alive
But you know these motherfuckers stay missing
Another day another pill man
So you know the deal man
They be pain killing, yeah
Ain’t no love if you ain’t wit it
Ain’t no love up in the city
But I've been for the freedom
I’m for the love
I’m tryna trust everybody that I’m with but it’s all fucked up
I said it’s all fucked up
Yo, yo you know I’m for the freedom
I’m for the love
I’m tryna trust everybody that I’m with
But it’s all fucked up
I said it’s all fucked up
Ain’t no love up in the city, ain’t no love up in the
