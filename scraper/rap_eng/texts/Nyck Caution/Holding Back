[Intro: Nyck Caution]
Yo, I've been holding back, holding crack
Focused on my loadin racks, stocking up this fire
Ain't nobody engulfing that, thank God the coast is back
Spank broads and blow the cash, that's not what I promote but sometimes I don't know notice that
I'm trippin'


[Verse 1: Nyck Caution]
Tryna' see my life as an incline, down ten times
Got up like eleven and I've been fine
Now I live life like somebody bouta end mine, ghost
All around I can sense life
I'm alone and I know what depressed like
I been broke and I ain't get dough and the past five days pray to god that the red light
You're so devious
Playing with my head, like I never really had no roll
Either be slept on instead, I would mess up pretend, like I never really had no soul
That ain't true mother fucker can't lie
All this tourin' got me hypnotized
I'm explorin' and they callin' me an outcast, 'cuz I ain't about cash
I'm just tryna rise
I'm just tryna ri - ise
Lower than the ass get
Gold digger just lookin' for a rap check
It was a great but I say it in the past tense
I moved on like I'm changin' up my address
I adapt like an Aztec
But my raps kinda sinkin' and my bags wet, yeah
And everybody got reasons just to get away when they need it
But I'm still breathin'
Still seasoned, till the day that we heathens
Everything's a memory, remember that freedom always exists in the mind you believe in
See, get high..
Hey
I can't lie
I can't lie
So you get high..


[Chorus: Alex Mali]
Gotta get my mind away
I ain't got no time to waste
(Get by)
Gotta get my mind away, my mind away
Make your mind up, mind up
(Get high)

Gotta get my mind away
(Can't lie)
I ain't got no time to waste
(Get high)
Gotta get my mind away, my mind away
Make your mind up, mind up
(Can't lie)


[Outro: Nyck Caution]
Yo I've been holding back!


"Go for it, you grab it, it belongs to you
Step up and you take what is yours my friend
You've been waiting, there's nothing between you and it
The only prison that occurs is the one that's in your mind
You can get whatever it is you want
Step up and take what's yours, son."
