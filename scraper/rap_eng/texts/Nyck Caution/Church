[Video edit Intro: "Baptize"]
Yo this the type of music make your momma cry
Homicide is on the rise, you pray you follow God
But we never follow instinct
Just pressure from the elders and our whole perspectives buildin'
Karma 'round the corner hope I play the block correct
Let my life surface, the world is ours
Soon I'll have a slot with Katie Couric
60 minutes 'till I'm poppin'
Never get trapped up in no box, break the locks, now we locked in Yeah, pause it

[Verse 1]
Check
I'm about to hit 'em in the head with this one
Been down for a while, now it's time to lift up
The kid got a mouth
Rap, while you sitting on the couch
Last one to live without a doubt
And it's Nyck, bitch
Suspect witness the outside crowd, get buffed from women
I'm down right now but I gut that limit
And evade in a space where I lust for a living like yo
What you think about, everything that we speak about
And you over there thinking that you real
It is how it is when you live what you dream about
So go rock to the anthem
Like oxy, indigo shit, 'bout to spread like prostate cancer
Can't stop the bandits we abandoned​
Put your hands up

[Hook]
This goes out if you was on it since the start of it all
When your apartment was small
Still got your arm through that door
Born from fornication, they had their former statements
That I would never amount for shit, but I’m born for greatness

[Verse 2]
Stop, relax and enjoy the pro and drop acetone on you bastards
Always on the run, can’t catch me
I be Lenny Kravitz when I fly into the astral zone
So get back
Don’t push the middle of the conflict up into the little thing we had
Bitch I ain’t Malcolm, busted the outcome
Doubt us, then we can’t function without trust
I ain’t got no TV plugin, but I know you see me buzzin’
We ain’t got nothin’, just pray to God we don’t plummet
Get right and correct with that stanza
Spit then I resent all that standards
Lift up cos they never gonna drop you, pop you
Never back down, you ain’t got to

[Hook]
This goes out if you was on it since the start of it all
When your apartment was small
Still got your arm through that door
Born from fornication, they had their former statements
That I would never amount for shit…

It's all in your mind

[Bridge]
Fly, until I die
I gotta stay Fly, until I die
I gotta stay Fly, until I die
I gotta stay Fly, until I die

[Outro]
Live for the highs, live through the lows
Live for the highs, live through the lows
Okay we live for the highs, been on my grind since the start
They say the limit’s the sky
Well I’ll be reaching for the stars
Live for the highs, live through the lows
Well I’ll be reaching for the stars
Live for the highs, live through the lows
They say the limit’s the sky
Live for the highs, live through the lows
Live for the highs
