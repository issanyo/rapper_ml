[Intro: Kirk Knight]
Alright let's do it
Parkside la-la la
Nyck @ Knight

[Hook: Kirk Knight]
Wake up call, ain't no dial up
Put my life on the line to get higher up
Told my plug I ain't high enough
I called that nigga back, said "I ain't high enough"
Wake up call, ain't no dial up
Put my life on the line to get higher up
Told my plug I ain't high enough
I called that nigga back, said "I ain't high enough"

[Verse 1: Nyck Caution & Kirk Knight]
It's a wake up call
Wake up, fly away and just escape it all
How you gon' come up when you ain't even raise the stakes at all?
Okay, you can never lose if you embrace the fall
Uh, you can never lose if you embrace the fall
While you're surfing through your TV
Nyck @ Knight changing your channels
Watch them boys make it look easy
First episode can get cancelled
I come alive in the shadows at the dark
We proceed wake up, smell the coffee, and roll your tree
High off life I might OD
Oh you home from work? Bitch, I work at home
Oh that's Nyck and Kirk? Don't act like y'all didn't know
Bitch don't call my phone, no service can't talk about it
Dose 'til I overload, might just cause a power outage

[Hook: Kirk Knight]
Wake up call, ain't no dial up
Put my life on the line to get higher up
Told my plug I ain't high enough
I called that nigga back, said "I ain't high enough"
Wake up call, ain't no dial up
Put my life on the line to get higher up
Told my plug I ain't high enough
I called that nigga back, said "I ain't high enough"

[Verse 2: Kirk Knight & Nyck Caution]
Make sure when you see the duo your plug up to par
'Cause your kush got me smoke close but no cigar
I'm smoking fronto hard for a newbie, might leave a scar
It take you on a high road you start seeing stars
With the right connect it might be your wake up call
Do you smell the coffee nigga, get your dreams involved
The world up in your palms, new year I can't drop the ball
Gotta switch it up if you can't evolve
Forget about the past, fuck that erase it all
I got issues clouding my judgement, I know that y'all can relate to that
But if you pick the pieces up and see the bigger picture then it really ain't as bad
Working on it like a maniac, overthinking when I'm alone
But never lose sight of the goal at hand
Only thing on the buzz be the dial tone

[Outro: Kirk Knight]
La-la la, la-la-la la, la
La la-la-la la
