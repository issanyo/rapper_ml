Donâ€™t fuck with me

[Verse 1: Nyck Caution]
As I drive on this highway looking through the side windows on a Friday
It be fucking cold out raining on a summer night
My family is old now I knew something wasn't right
But they say you take the moments to live it
But I'm sidetracked by crap and BBM'ing these bitches
Relax in the back and tap up the system
And blast out the jams and plan out the mission, look
Yeah, its a dream that I had
That I could have a bag of money wishes and fans and open it up daily I'll make my family glad
See the dreams of my dad and give him reason to laugh
Because we subtle needing these dream puddles avoiding all of the fumbles And hitting every rebuttal and leave it all on the court and thrive my life up for muscle and never puzzle with struggle and double all of the love, yeah
I know I said that stuff about my dad because he left
Thats just one of the struggles that I've had
But a couple talks in, [?] angry rewritting writtens
I've found the strength in my heart to suck it up and forgive him
So just listen, thats probably the best thing I've ever done
Because now he's here and theres nothing that can measure love
A lot of dollars in cars revving them engines up
Don't compare to somebody that can give a fuck

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Nyck Caution]
And at the end of the day, I'm still a single man
Not that I choose to I just haven't found the one I'm used to
I need one but I could use two
So I do too, not again
Just another time I've been mistaken
Aand baited into these traps of the naked
What am i supposed to do?
Im so pressured into taking what I'm not supposed to have
Now these faces started fading
Theres only so much you can take
And these women in my life are starting to [?]
A relationship is not for me, I probably just fake it
Its just the way that I'm meant to be I really can't take it
Im sorry about tripping hard and hardly calling you darling
But I got too many thoughts, lost you in the morning
I gotta get going, I gotta get started, because my destiny is calling
Boy you know I'm all in
Yeah, and thats not a diss to anybody
Im just saying that I can spit with anybody
So get with it or run the other way
Another hungry day just waiting till money pays
I got mainstream sound with them underground lyrics
They said I'd never make it I'll just redefine their physics
Guess i'll switch it, [?] will be told
I spit the truth boy, that why I'm me for

[Quote from Pursuit of Happiness]
It was right then that I started thinking about Thomas Jefferson on the Declaration of Independence and the part about our right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. And I remember thinking how did he know to put the pursuit part in there? That maybe happiness is something that we can only pursue and maybe we can actually never have it. No matter what. How did he know that?
