(HooK)
Go bizarre on the beat like it's Dunkirk
Dropping bombs on these bitches like Dunkirk
Get the work done never have fun first
We can all run the wave when it's done first
Doesn't always mean you're gonna win last, gotta shine on these hoes like a sun burst

(Verse 1)
Cause I might die today, thats why I gotta take mine theres no time to waist
You living your life asking if I relate, We don't relate
They been sleeping on us, they'll hibernate
Nyck @ Knight dropped now they wide awake
The beast coast back in a major way, we paved the way
Bitch it's Nyck Caution
If the bitch trip then I get the bitch tossing
If I throw shots, I Ain't missing shit often
