[Intro: Statik Selektah]
Live from Brooklyn, New York City
My name is Statik Selektah
Next Up from Pro Era, got my little brother Nyck Caution
Get 'em Nyck

[Verse 1: Nyck Caution]
You motherfuckers know name Nyckie
'Bout to kill this fucking game swiftly
If you 'bout the dollars, come and holler, leave the bank empty
I'm really bout to be a monster when the game pick me
And you know I get the brain, until my dame trippy
I'm from the mill, ya'll can smell it when the scales lurking
Caught up with the pills, probably die before they L swerve, yeah
Last year ya'll was slanging dope
Left ASAP, this my Last Year Being Broke
Don't get me gassed up
Break the leash and take the Jet Li mask off
Iâ€™m Gretzky it's all net when I blast off
I fuck a bitch and I just leave her in my past thoughts
But still Caution got drama 'bout like every thang
Everybody got a question 'bout like every thang
Yo why you never 'round, why you not on Joey album?
Yo, when the tape dropping, how the fuck you feel about it?
'Cause we been waiting forever
We call you engineering with Trevor
For the thousandth time, excuses don't never get better
I think you lazy, or maybe you're just unaware
Of opportunity and where you'd be if it just wasn't there
Back to college probably missing buses, you don't got to miss interpret
Perspective has to do with present situation service
But reflection makes you feel the purpose
And where you could have been if you ain't choose' the right excursion
'Cause this is life in the middle of the fast lane
Touch mics, spit a little bit of rap flame
Competition I just smoke 'em then I put 'em in an ashtray
You really need to take my last name
You need some Caution
I'm really about the shit I'm talkin'
Live through the lows, tryin' to keep my spirits northward
Everything is coursin', got me feeling like I'm coughin'
But I never have possession, only stress that made me nauseous, yeah
I'm just tryin' to to get the cycle that this life provide
Just tryin' to get some currency to get a slice of pie
Michael Knight, riding 'til the sun is raisin'
Metaphor to life itself; read between the lines and face it
Take from me, if you can't wait dummy
Cause' I'd rather you a snake then be impatient
Basically I'm sayin' if you with it, then be with me for whatever, ti'll whatever
That's the only way I taught it to be sacred, uh

[Interlude: Nyck Caution]
Yeah, see that's the only way I've taught it to be sacred, yeah
Bring it back, yeah, yeah

[Verse 2: Nyck Caution]
I was actin' like the bases were fine
From the basin never thought I could make it in time
I just really want to make sure that my mama eatin'
That's all I ask from ya'll can take the weight and cost of beefin'
But if you motherfuckers talkin' I'ma find ya'll, toss you to the fire
And steal the youth up over here, so strap a leash around your baby collar
If you play it proper, make sure your payment higher
Cause' if they catch you at your lowest they won't spare you if you makin' dollars
Make cheese, make paper, make believe
You was messin' with me
Hated the pressure, leave me feelin' wasted
With the world, is on my back, said I'mma grind
Those who got me, so I either break my promise or my spine
And on the real I ain't tryin' to break nothin'
I don't want to get a piece, dog I'm tryin' to become it
Throwing roses at my feet when I'm live in your country, cuz
These are the days of our lives and I ain't changin' nothin'
I get this made in a night, Joey I'm reppin'
And you know I'm stressin', tryin' to make this product something classic but
I be rottin' from the trenches to the Madge's, been progressive from the bottom
We flying off to Paris, on the real
I wrote this, we was boardin' at the moment
Courtney told me I would take it here
A different city every night, 'nother city in the mornin', just to make it clear
It was a dream and it only took a couple years
All these slices getting taken care of
See most the people that are hating didn't even have the guts to try it out, so they frontin' with they fake career
You a critic man you ain't up here
This is a warning to the masses, I ain't Paul Revere
I'm just the next best thing, Shipes like Paul Hammes
So know the underdog is undertaken
I'm incomparable with nothin', understand it, underrated is an understatement
Unaffiliated with you little demonstrations
Don't retaliate just live with being decimated
I'm from the bottom 'til it escalated
Ya'll asleep, [?] wandered east
Fed his natives, not a fleet
Spread the nation tryin' to teach elevation
Now the white is blacking out, rest in peace segregation, yeah
I'm only twenty-one, but my soul ancient
I don't know age, young assassin leave the throne vacant

[Outro: Nyck Caution & Statik Selektah]
I don't know age, young assassin leave the throne vacant
Yeah, I said I don't know age, young assassin leave the throne vacant
Motherfucking Nyck Caution
Nyck Caution project coming soon
