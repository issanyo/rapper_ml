[Nyck Caution]
I took the pieces of the puzzle, pick em up
Shit, I'm known to solve you motherfuckers
Your daddy's home shit, I'm known to scar you motherfuckers
Evict victims like I'm Odom on his crack
Like I'm Owen on a strap that didn't hold him to collapse
It's what I'm talking bout, this game wet ya boy blazing
You ain't raising you a raisin
Phase in, once I get this aim in to your temple
Amen to the fallen soldiers, aimed it and resettled
Aced your fucking levels, now the game good
I can't explain well, life's a bitch but the brain good
This great dane got a grip on the lane
Would do anything to seize it, any season any sequence
Got me shining Danny Sequin
I'm a heavy smoker that's a eighth and his dutch master
I slay tracks can't relate to you punk rappers
I lay back getting face from whoever
Who can pressure? Who can measure? With this Era over everything
Lookin' at that very ring just a Jr. who display bars
Getting close to that Jerry King, ring closer than you think
Nyck got it bout it air tied wrapped around his bare knuckles
I know my fare double, I had a fair struggle
Yeah, rap was passive, now it's key, I’m not a Maverick
Still independent, real vision fixed upon us
Real bigger ticket and I'm still killing, Uh
Life is just a journey that will probably leave you gurneyed up
Or once you leave the hospital it's possible you've learned enough
To get it cracking, pick up where you slacking
Stick up in the booth I bet I leave out with a classic

[Danse]
Now all of these niggas is god this and got that
Monotheistic blick I leave a God flat
What y'all did? Y'all downloaded a God app?
The most high in your set can catch a god slap
Throw 1 grenade in a room where all the Gods at
Real Gods cannot die or take a God nap
If you white, then God's black
If you black, God is asian
If you asian then gods Bayesian
Swing open a straight edge, blade em after I fade em
The faces in the funeral Drake watched by Jaden
I told Caution bring the yellow tape melo face
Game winner flow that's about to bring me that Melo cake
All black when I'm robbin', no yellow cape
Give me that blue pink splashed over a yellow bass
Labels treating me like Avonte Oquendo
Now they rock the pens whenever I let the pen go
In a minaj with Suzy Orman and Sally Mae
Suzy told me do Sally like Ike did Anna Mae
Lightning, strike me twice when I was twelve
Since then, I pitch 12 12 regulars full of gamma rays
I'm HiiiPower you the airbrush on hightower
I'm in your bitch she having an inner thigh shower
They fear power, this sour got me higher
Than a nigga fucking fixing the roof up on the sears tower
I mean Willis, Chi niggas are fearless
From Chi-raq to Brook, nah I am the realest
Rest in peace King Capital Steez
My astral projection been attracting [?]

[Nyck Caution]
Take caution every time I ventilate
Never been a fake now I'm plotting on some real estate
Bitch I renovate, now my view got me a dinner plate
With lobster like a mobster good fella in my D.N.A
Call me the general I generally generalize
The genocide now I'll see if you can really stay
Got nothing, S.T.I.C.K.E.R.A Forever now see
Till we hold the era down

[Danse Dimes]
I could make a third eye look like Forest Whitakers
I'm force feeding niggas these Gel packs
From St. Peter's Basilica to masonic temples
They want me dead cause they know that I'm way beyond they mentals
Too deep Olympic pools standing at the bottom
On my two feet, looking up like who's he? Sheesh
They show no love I keep the steel strapped
That's why I Romeo’d that with bullet head still in tact
Facts, you don't spit enough of em
These fake niggas is dead pour off some duff on em
The B.S. got a verse I put huffs on em
Watch Danse Daniel Atlas switch the cuffs on em
The flatbush for the tricks couple bucks on em
Take the fedi the iPhone niggas truck on em
True relegions under the hoodie deluxe on em
Anaheim the Flying V, the mighty ducks on em
