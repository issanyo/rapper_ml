Part 1: Element
[Verse 1]
I'm willing to ride for the clique
Undersized, still the heart of a giant inside of him
Raw raps
It sounds sanitized when you spit
Vandalize any beat, I make it mine if I wish
I know you haters heated by my recent success
Just breathe and accept
They'll never be a reason to stress you anymore
Nyck dope like I'm breathing in meth
Defeating the vets
None of y'all are even a threat
Take money to make money
Live and you learn
Life's about what you take from it
Used to starve, now I'm eating meals for about 8 stomachs
Same people fronting, same people ask you when the tape coming
I'm an almanac when it comes to the facts
And I'm a fucking quarterback when it comes to the passes
You know she throw it back when she come to the crib
Cause I'm a young legend when it comes to the masses, but...

[Hook 1]
If I really don't fuck with the bitch I don't let her call me Jessie
If you gonna send shots at the kid, better throw that shit directly
I pull up, kill shit, dip out, leave the scene messy
They been asking where the Era been, well...

[Interlude]
If I gotta rap on someone else's beat to get your attention
Then it's something that I gotta do to get it excessive records, it's record setting
Pressure fueling, I use extra effort
No extra men cause everything I touch is gold
Whew, I love goooold

Part 2: DNA: Part 1
[Verse 2]
I got, I got, I got, I got issues in my brain
Inside make me act inhumane
Fuck around with Nyck react and do some shit I can't explain
I go dumb when I black out, shit feel numb like novacane
I don't get how you can hate, look how much I overcame
They ain't think the Era had this in 'em
Adapt to the track cause the cat spit venom
Nah you ain't getting no 90's flow
But I been raw with the rap since '94
See when it's all said and done and it's time to go
You'll see where I stand in the mix
Don't care bout the glam and the glits
Just a kid want a chance to transform his life with a wrist
So I did it
Uh, who the fuck are you to tell me what I can do
Hmmm, I'll wait
Switch flows when my mind change
23 years young in my Jordan year, I'm at a prime age
I don't wanna have to violate, but my instincts turned me to a primate
So the push came to shove and I boxed it all in
Now it's time that I break out of, break out of my cage

[Hook 2]
I seen a whole lot of shit in my days
Times change, people change
Still I maintain
I seen a whole lot of shit in my days
Times change, people change
I remain the same always
I seen a whole lot of shit in my days
Times change, people change
Still I maintain
I seen a whole lot of shit in my days
Times change, people change

Part 3: DNA: Part 2
[Verse 3]
I got, I got, I got, I got
I'm willing to ride for the clique
Undersized, still the heart of a giant inside of him
Raw raps
It sounds sanitized when you spit
Vandalize any beat, I make it mine if I wish
I know you haters heated by my current success
Just breathe and accept
They'll never be a reason to stress you anymore
Nyck dope like I'm breathing in meth
Defeating the vets
None of y'all are even a threat
All days in the denim distressed
I always old Wanye body any beat that I bless
I got ice in my veins, frozen heart in the chest
I'm cold blooded, white walkers I be feeding on flesh
Meech, Erick, Juice, Zombies in the set
The Beast Coast, Pro Era that's a premium flex
I'm in a V speeding with Lex
Late round draft pick, tell them something that they couldn't even project
I'm Isaiah with the shot, Draymond with aggression
Underrated rookie overlooked by the rest
Now I'm a pro
You ever seen a Nyck grow
Seen a trip sellin Jet [?] better sound of life
So I put the negative sound
So I started cutting parts & pushing people off
I know you're sad but I don't really care if you cry
Any beat Kill Bill with it
Got a whole lot of mils to make
I'm OJ with the Bills
Just another kid from the mill toned up but he still did it with real skill
Nyck ill but he's still dealing
Dope deal I don't need shitters
Only the fam and if you wasn't with it from the beginning
Don't expect a seat when the team winning
