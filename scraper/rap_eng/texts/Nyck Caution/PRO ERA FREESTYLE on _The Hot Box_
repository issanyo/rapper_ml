[Verse 1: Nyck Caution]

The times are changing, ok, fine, we arrange it let my eyes
Explain it, dire situation, reside inside of that basement
Ugh, some people dying, get erased, i'm impatient
And not in tie with no places, i'm first finishing placement
Pace your independence like Lance when i crossover
Pick your passes like Chad as a Pro Bowler
Slow flowing, then pick it up at any minute
Henny dripping, I know, don't condemn me if they catch me slipping
And they still silent, and it's still silence
Catch you, still standing still lighter fluid leave you still silent
Dear Lord, I've been tryna get me a rack like every week, fucked up, but i'm still trying
I be an ill tyrant, if i really skill (?) appeal
I'd get you killed like I fed you up to some real lions
I be really rhyming, when i spit, your ears trying
To understand the real prime peaking, but i'm still climbing
I bet you will find him, prolly on the better
Side, my grass green and the weather fine, neighbors
In a suit, tie, coupe blue, never seen a noose
Tied, all that's gonna happen in due time, so I
Can't lose, never try, I'll get rich, never die
Word to Fif', never lied, word to Nicki's enterprise
Murder anything you heard about, urban legend pumping herb
Herbs, take your person out, cut your throat and curve
Your mouth, courage I be bursting out, wait until I purchase
This crib, i'm going in, that's why I keep it versatile
If you're standing on my ground; X 'em out
Got a long way, leaving my impression when I wreck
It out
Muthafuckin' Nyck Caution

[Verse 2: Kirk Knight]

As my word get more dilated
The pupil of the southern man, closer to annihilation
Following Peter Pans, tour want the land but nothing is forever
So as the (?) ticking time gets very clearer
Niggas try to stop me
Tryna act against me, will only get next to me
