[Verse 1: Joey Bada$$]
I was born runnin' with the baton
Now I'm known as the young intellectual don
Until I'm gone, where I'm from, the real don't get along
With the fake, look me in the face, eyes of the storm
You don't want none
No beef could never hurt me
I be on my Istanbul, they cold turkey
Firstly, it's the double entendre monster
Takin' haunted constant trips through your conscious
So be cautious
If it call for it, we leavin' corpses
The causes of the coffin is the broken clauses
Skeletons in my closet, tomorrow's never promised
Never mind it because we immortals regardless
Real G's move in silence like my designer
Intertwined with the timeless, divine higher powered
I was drippin' in the gold since a minor
Sittin' on my throne overlookin' my empire, uh, uh

[Chorus: Joey Bada$$]
Resurrection of real, you niggas fake
Never second-guessin' my kill, so choose your fate
'Cause I'm born runnin' with the baton, a tickin' time bomb
Nigga, better ring the alarm, uh
Resurrection of real, you niggas fake
Never second-guessin' my kill, so choose your fate
'Cause I'm born runnin' with the baton, a tickin' time bomb
Nigga, better ring the alarm, uh

[Bridge: Joey Bada$$]
So keep it spinnin', disc jocker
Flick the wrist, don't risk that, partner
These niggas impostors, we movin' like the mobsters
One false move, have 'em sleepin' with the lobsters, huh
So keep it spinnin', disc jocker
Flick the wrist, don't risk that, partner
These niggas impostors, we movin' like the mobsters
One false move, have 'em sleepin' with the...

[Verse 2: Joey Bada$$]
It's the ALL-AMERIKKKAN BADA$$
Who you mad at? They ain't have to ask that
Attack with the backlash, where's my cash at?
Runnin' all through NASDAQ, strap in my backpack
Goin' off the knack, dopeboy in the Cadilac
Havin' flashbacks, wish a nigga would clap back
Hit 'em with the blackjack, goin' through a stack fast
I snap with the raps, I make 'em bring the whole track back
Niggas get smacked with the realer
When I drop, it's all killer, no feelings
So you better not make a wrong move, nigga
I'll personally deliver each shot that won't miss ya
And when it hit ya, it's no warnin'
We bombardin', me and my squadron
If you want it, get your army
We droppin' bombs calmly
This is no party
Any scraps left, we just feed 'em to the zombies

[Bridge: Meechy Darko]
Death before dishonor, I die for my brethren
This is a stick-up, ocean's 47
Ring the alarm, if a war yuh wan get in
Ring the alarm, if a war yuh wan get in
Death before dishonor, I die for my brethren
This is a stick-up, ocean's 47
Ring the alarm, if a war yuh wan get in
Ring the alarm, if a war yuh wan get in

[Verse 3: Nyck Caution & Kirk Knight]
Ring the alarm, we ain't keepin' it calm
Need a reason to see the dog, break the leash and I'm on
Was hungry when I started, more ravenous as I evolve
Caution hazardous, inflictin' damages, I can't recall, uh
Rich in spirit when I broke some laws
I'm breakin' even with my Pros against all the oddsMade my words cut deep, you gon' need some gauzeAnd that alcohol, we only goin' bar for bar
You know I blacked out, they bring the track out, I lay the smack down
Remember nights on the dirty mattress in the trap house?
I snap out 'em and flipped it around to where I'm at now
Livin' legend, finally back up on the map now
Resurrection of real, let's bring it back
It ain't even about the bars, they bumpin' whatever slaps now
All I hear is that ad-lib rappin' on my SoundCloud
Sick of the trash out, this is the crackdown

[Outro: Meechy Darko]
Likkle bwoy dun backshot we'll bury ya
Big metal ting ya get Captain Amerikkka
Beast coat regime (La Cosa Nostra)
My team supreme (Fuck around and smoke ya)
Death before dishonor, I die for my brethren
This is a stick-up, ocean's 47
Ring the alarm, if a war yuh wan get in
Ring the alarm, if a war yuh wan get in
