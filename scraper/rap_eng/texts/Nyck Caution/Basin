[Intro]
No wait
Back up
Let me start over there
For six months
I couldn't sleep
With insomnia nothing's real
Everything's far away
Everything's a copy of a copy, of a copy
When you have insomnia you're never really asleep
And never really awake

[Hook]
I be up all night
Tryna get things right, but this ain't quite
How I envision this life
I envision this life
I be up all night
This ain't life man
This can't be right
I envision this life
I envision this life
I be up all, night
Pounding the pavement
Let me take it back to the basics
Back to the basin
Right back to the basement
I be up all, night
Pounding the pavement
Let me take it back to the basics
Back to the basin
Right back to the basement

[Verse 1]
I'm alive
I'll arrive for the ride
Decide what I do with my time when I die
Remind everybody left behind that I was living for the moment, so
Really when you find the same grip
That I did with
Nah, you realize, it's not about no nine to five
You just passing time
Crashing I, fantasize, never living no passive life
You ain't got the answers
Sway let 'em know I'm rap's new paradigm
On my parasol
Yeah, just tryna find paradise
Just tryna find paradise
Just tryna find paradise

[Hook]
I be up all night
Tryna get things right, but this ain't quite
How I envision this life
I envision this life
I be up all night
This ain't life man
This can't be right
I envision this life
I envision this life
I be up all, night
Pounding the pavement
Let me take it back to the basics
Back to the basin
Right back to the basement
I be up all, night
Pounding the pavement
Let me take it back to the basics
Back to the basin
Right back to the basement

[Bridge]
No wait
Back up
Let me start over

[Verse 2]
I'm alive
Right back to the basement
Fight back, life jack when you ain't shit
Cuz lil' homie think a rack make the payments
But you gon' need a hundred stacks to replace this
Old life, you was living on the pavement
No shine when you with it underneath the basing
I still got a homie tripping 'bout the other day
Like you ain't never chilling
You ain't never come to stay
Sorry, I been drowning, I do not want to suffocate
In fact, I think I spoke to god just the other day
Time is of the essence
I be representing
What the resurrection mean
I ain't never gonna understand
Out of service (out of service)
I ain't working (I ain't working)
But I be dealing with Trevor on every summer day
So anytime you hit me
Understand I'm busy
Hit a quickie, then you know I be the face where I underlay
I see no fees
Casino dreams
Casino bling
See like the keynote speaks
The Preemo spot
That's what I aim for
Getting high like a novel king
Why would I explain more?
I'm tryna stand on top of the clouds like a plane's floor
And I ain't never coming down 'til the rain pour
Rhythm madness, video projected
My life's a film and my scenery's cinematic

[Outro]
I'm alive
I'll arrive for the ride
And decide what I do with my time when I die
When I die
Remind everybody left behind
