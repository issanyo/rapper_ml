[Intro: Michael Scott, (Dwight Schrute) and Nyck Caution]
Oh my God! Okay, it's happening
Everybody stay calm!
Everybody stay calm!
(What's the procedure, everyone? What's the procedure?)
Stay ******* calm!
(Wait, wait, waitâ€¦)
Everybody just ******* calm down!
Man, man, fuck Nyck Caution, man
Fuck Nyck Caution
Ay, yeah

[Chorus]
It's lil' Nyuk, drop a fuckin' nuke
Beat get Nagasaki'd
In the stu', Daniel Son in the booth, this is not karate
Face the truth, 'bout to hold the belt real soon
Shinsuke Nakamari, Nakamura
I'm a little cozy, sorta
Big shout out to Rocky
Still I got a lot more cozy I could be
Got the whole coast on a track, it's the beast
When you spell my name, please don't forget the C
I already had people spell it with a I, shit is weak
Nyck @ Knight heatin' up the street
You could never lose if you fall on your back, on your feet
Feelin' like Jon Snow, always take lead
Do it for my queen, still I never bend the knee

[Verse]
Cold in the winter, never freeze
Summer I'm a hot boy, 400 degrees
What I'm really sayin' is I ain't adapted to change
When the wind blow, gotta angle to the breeze
They sleepin' on the kid, but they dreamin' 'bout somebody like me
This is everything that I breathe
This a perfect murder, I'ma murder anybody I see
If you try and take what I eat, yeah
Who else could take a typo and run with it?
I'm havin' fun with an error, it's the era of the young and lit
From NY to UK, I'm in London
Nyck is back to get the bag and puncture it
Every track sound like when the thunder hit
Lay it down, go to work, I don't fucking miss
The studio is my office
This is Dunder Mifflin, calm down and listen
I'm bound to fix it
Always get it done, my sound efficient
I remember I was not allowed in this shit
Now I get aroused, same venues turned me down, proud I'm in it
[?] that's what happens when you try
Maybe it's a blessing in disguise
I'm a New York underground king
Just read between the lines, yeah, ah, ooh

[Chorus]
It's lil' Nyuk, drop a fuckin' nuke
Beat get Nagasaki'd
In the stu', Daniel Son in the booth, this is not karate
Face the truth, 'bout to hold the belt real soon
Shinsuke Nakamari, Nakamura
I'm a little cozy, sorta
Big shout out to Rocky
Still I got a lot more cozy I could be
Got the whole coast on a track, it's the beast
When you spell my name, please don't forget the C
I already had people spell it with a I, shit is weak
Nyck @ Knight heatin' up the street
You could never lose if you fall on your back, on your feet
Feelin' like Jon Snow, always take lead
Do it for my queen, still I never bend the knee

[Outro]
When you spell my name, please don't forget the C
Do it for my queen, still I never bend the knee
I already had people spell it with a I, shit is weak
Nyck @ Knight heatin' up the street
You could never lose if you fall on your back, on your feet
Nyuk!

[Game of Thrones sample: Tyrion Lannister, Daenerys Targaryen and Jon Snow]
Forever?
Forever
So I assume, my Lord, you're here to bend the knee
I am not
