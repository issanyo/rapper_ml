[Intro]
Crucifix

[Verse 1: Nyck Caution]
It's all the time when I would think about it
Yeah, I got these royals I'm a king about it
This grip is tight don't try to loosen it
Cause when you do this shit
You see what music get
Uh, open up your eyes and see the truth in it
Not only Jesus on that crucifix
So when you see it, just make sure you gon' achieve it
'fore you die and stay deceased with never proving shit
Loosened cycle, who knew?
Doubled up on YouTube, probably overnight like Kirk's ceiling
You ain't popping man
You never conquer, let 'em ponder
Bout to spend a sponsored budget on whatever, word to Trevor
I'm whatever God has made me
Use whatever logic, shoot Berettas, get your bread up
Man we fed up with this concept
I was scared once
Now acquired that wave pure like Poseidon and I'm dashing without the hyphen
Parents hope I'm providing, but it's scarce and uninviting for the time being
Still down and behind speeding
So I'mma get it in a minute, the record spinning
Guerrilla rhythm, y'all know how I'm feeling

[Hook: Nyck Caution]
Open up your eyes and see the truth in it
Not only Jesus on that crucifix
Yeah, if you ain't got it, you can't hold it
You ain't never had your moment
You ain't never showed no focus
Open up your eyes and see the truth in it
Not only Jesus on that crucifix
Yeah, if you ain't got it, you can't hold it
You ain't never had your moment
You ain't never showed no focus
Open up your eyes and see the truth in it

[Interlude: Interviewer, Capital STEEZ]
Tell the people about the concept behind AmeriKKKan Korruption
I mean, like, basically it was a time in my life where I thought I was going crazy, you know. And like, I realized that I wasn't the one that was crazy, I realized that it's the system that was built against me you know. And like, I'm not supposed to be talking about this and that's the corruption of it because like me just saying it, it's absurd and I want people to open up their eyes and realize that I'm not wrong you know. I'm just an open minded individual and people should be more open minded

[Verse 2: Joey Bada$$]
Yo, it's the third wide eye
Never need to ask wide eyed
Better be a wise guy, dip the rhymes in formaldehyde
And when I come around from miles they hide
Cause my black skin disguise the God inside
Watch me rise beyond the sky
Not because I believe I can fly
But because I dream my people will be free from the lies
Someday, I see an end on CNN and channel five
From channeling different spirits and minds
Feel it getting clearer with the space and time
As I get near to the devine ruling to my time of fine jeweling
Dropping all seldom, when you catch it
I hope you held it long enough to the see the egg of life hatching
And to the Lord we pray
But see life calm in every step we take
Cause every death it makes another lesser great
Let all my brothers rise and in respects I say

[Verse 3: Nyck Caution]
Pray, take a knee an look at what you gotta see
This life an odyssey and honestly I’m tryna get my story potent
Back before when I was searching for the door to open
I had to find the key myself, see the truth locked up
Don’t lie to yourself
Got eyes in the back of my head
Sacrifice for the lost symbolism
Get attached to my thoughts
What if I was nailed down?
What if I was on the cross?

[Verse: 4 Joey Bada$$]
What if I was jailed now?
What if my life was just tossed?
I could probably [?] or take my hoodie off
Tell a Rodney King tale that would probably result
A world where everyone was taught how to love
And not how to shoot up up they blood and they cousin
Open up your door for a nigga when he buzzing
God up above ‘em all you gotta do is trust him
Phony niggas always come in, every diamond a dozen

[Verse 5: Nyck Caution]
Dozen, got a couple dimes in this blunt
Nyck is puffing with the homies, but my mind on Korruption
Fuck it I gotta trust it I can summit before I crumble
Dive in we look for trouble
Misguided and missing all the pieces that’ll fit the puzzle

[Outro: Joey Bada$$]
And what's a world without trouble
Double the peace, drop the piece
Come grab you a piece of this humble pie
And what's a world without trouble
Double the peace, drop the piece
Come grab you a piece of this humble pie
