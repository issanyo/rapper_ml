Hey, hey, hey

[Verse 1]
When it comes to rap, all your stats selective
All my credit gon' be proven when I touch and smash your record
I'm the dopest with it, I swear that all my cracks infective
Give your ass a dosage, I got that stash for any weather, oh
Yeah, I said so let me switch the mood
You got to take a risk and then take a ship to that moon
And I don't want to come back
I don't wanna dub that
You talking but you just another spoken or hubcap
Not original, I am not subliminal
Working all winter just to make the summer critical
Putting words to visuals
Live and learn, the system won't ever keep you locked because the world will not imprison you

[Interlude]
Yeah, I said the world will not imprison you
Live and learn because the world will not imprison you
Uh, I'm just putting words to visuals
Check, check, uh

[Verse 2]
I closed my eyes for a minute
Then I opened up and saw the world for what it was and how to catch a vibe with it
I'll be in the sky, I disguise limits
Lost in the music, getting hypnotized in it, yeah
Go to church if religion can save you
But this music saved my life so for rhythm I'm thankful, yeah
While y'all were hearing sermons from the preast
I was writing all my verses to these beats
Made it work, made it mixed and made it magical
And made me go around the world as my sabbatical
It threw me place to place, Caution on the catapult
And California calibrate him where the camera go
Cause now my life is like a movie, real Cinematic shit
Real groovy, check the reel for the clips
Smoke clips and real doobies
If I feel [?], I just throw the weed up
At audio mag if I need it got to re-up, yeah
And i don't got no more to say, Imma freestyle
Let it fucking spray off the brain if you know me
Know what I say, know I'm Ginobili
With the left hand yeah a Spur like I'm Kobe
No, thats a Laker, I just get the paper
In Brooklyn trynna get to ecuators
Thats somewhere else hotter than I'm at
Yeah you know where I be, yeah all around the map
