[Verse 1: Nyck Caution]
All i got is one dream, one team, one goal
One last second on the clock 'til we sprung gold
One question, ask god why you got to take 'em young?
For atleast let 'em blossom and see if they get the pun, yo
This shit is dumb slow
Why you got to bless me with a breath, but curse me with a debt?
[?] where i'm left, but what if our respect is gone
And i still haven't murdered all my stress
I got one thought, is religion consistent?
Because i needed you before and ain't nobody to listen
But look
I ain't tellin' you to go
But if you is busy you should just let me fucking know
If this the way the story got to go, then open a book
I ain't really scared i'm just hoping he shook
Because i always got them butterflies turning as i'm yurning
And kick this fucking [?] 'em
This the way it's been
It's not my fucking fault the way i've come up
I try to make a change but this world is too fucked up
Give me a nut bust for a buck
And ruin this girl's day but both of our life suck
I'm sorry this shit is ours but we lost in no direction
But this shit don't ever change, everybody is connected
In the pain that they feel so maintained, but you came and sustained it, never let 'em change it

[Hook: Nyck Caution]
All i got is one dream (All i got is one dream x4)
All i got is one dream (All i got is one dream x4)
All i got is one dream (All i got is one dream x4)
All i got is one dream (All i got is one dream x4)

[Verse 2: Nyck Caution]
All i got is one dream, i think greatness on a platter
But, what's the matter with disasters that we transfer
Every continent, sending out these rocket ships
There's a lot of shit that still needs accomplishing, yeah
Every project's a trap
Because they stuck there and nobody's responding to that
And the fact that the blacks and the whites [?] in the same brackets of life has
Got me out of lost for words
Dont judge me you would have probably thought im scared
But i brought my urge to just talk my words so
Listen close, take a walk and learn, yeah
Lady dies in a murder story
They speak about it like they got fucking cameras and purgatory
Cause they always dream that heaven is a spot for the fallen
But what if they have not seen a shot of a coffin
And her face just rots and you know that she stalling
And her fate is in lock, right below satan's calling
But no one ever speaks about it
They just think about, time for me to preach about it

[Hook: Nyck Caution]
All i got is one dream (All i got is one dream x4)
All i got is one dream (All i got is one dream x4)
All i got is one dream (All i got is one dream x4)
All i got is one dream (All i got is one dream x4)

[Verse 3: Nyck Caution]
All i got is one dream
Not to get shot down, or school locked down
And the fucking students shooting cops now
They got to stop
They got a semi locked as they aim for my top and i drop
They don't want to fucking witness so they pop
And if the shit don't go to plan, then i will rot and not
Make another song again, or even see my fam
They can't stand me, so they try to put me in [?] man
Got thirty three, so there is seventeen and one
I'm seventeen young but the bullets gonna come
As they spray, i feel myself shot
Each bullet for a year, he pulled it over [?]
I swear i see the reaper in my vision, im trying to keep up
But it be [?] about a minute and i'm leaking where my chin is
I drop down, and the pavement is cold
There is no saving me, i'm feeling like i'm [?] in hold
I just gasp for breath, less than half is left
I just grab my chest, and hope i pass to rest
There's no [?], i've been stabbed and pressed
Cold blooded, i can smell this maggot's breath
As i lay helpless, scream, my eyes to the sky
I see my killer and i notice that he's my-
Bestfriend
The ski mask away, he just blast i away as i pass away

[Outro: Nyck Caution]
All i got is one dream
All i got is one dream
All i got is one dream
All i got is one dream
