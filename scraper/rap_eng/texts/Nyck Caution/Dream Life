[Verse 1: Nyck Caution]
I had a decent night
Textin' the most recent pipe
Hittin' me up, she wanna come sleep tonight
I tried to say "no", but I just do it cause she just a bad influence
But somethin' makes me pursue it
I'm a swagged out general
They on my genitals
I got the chemicals to put me on yo' pedestal
Yeah, we straight puffin' on some medical
Leave me fuckin' higher than a plane with some federals
Oh, damn, she poke me back
Where the fuck they know me at?
Cozy at home, she takin' photos and she show me that rack
Then invites me right up in her home
And even if it's silicone, you know that I'm finna bone
Fuck it, I'm 'bout to duck, she suck it
And if some rubber poppin' out, I'm 'bout to crunch and shove it
It's all love, and I don't want no dumpster rubbish
I want a five-star chick, she don't lust for cuppin'
And yeah my team right
Because we be right
And we be fresher than some fish, can you see right?
I'm tryna get up in this, I just hope that key right
This that fuckin' dream life
This that fuckin' dream life

[Verse 2: Leon Marin]
Oh, man
I had an awful night
Textin' my least recent pipe
I'm hittin' her, "Can I come sleep tonight?"
She tried to say "no", and we go through it
But my mood is lighter fluid
And I'm hittin' her like Cupid
With these bow-and-arrow lines
She be tellin' me her time's great
Pokin' her on Facebook, screamin' she needs my space
Twitter her, I follow her and tell her what I need
She's too fabulous for me, so I need to let her breathe
And I'm like, "Damn, you really got an attitude?"
Commandments, told this chick to follow her beatitudes
And when I drop lines, she be heated like equator
Used to say she loved me, now she's playin' hater
Puts me in positions when she tells that she hates me
Used to be a Hercules, and now she calls me "Hades"
Man, this just doesn't seem right
This isn't the dream life
I just need the dream life
Agh
