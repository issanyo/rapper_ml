[Verse 1: Chelsea Reject]
Show me my opponent
Can never catch up in it until I give you try
That defy everything you thought you knew for sure inside of your mind
Cause they used to say I was lame
And I didn't even try to defend myself
Won't even try to deny
Cause I came in looking fly in the skies
Like "What's higher than I?"
Eye and eye will provide
When I'm running out of ideas and onomatopoeias
This shit is hard but somehow they want to be us
What you see on television ain't the truth
I'd be happy if I could cop me a Prius
Not every rapper sitting in a Coupe
So you better your trouse
Now that's not me saying that I'm any better than you
Just think I put my stuff to better use
So don't get it confused
And mob influence been killing my victim with their own muse
It's amusing

[Hook: Chelsea Reject]
I make you dance to the music
I,I make you dance to the music
I,I  make you dance to the music
I make you a fan, it's amusing
I,I make you dance to the music
I,I  make you dance to the music
I,I make you dance to the music
I make you a fan, it's amusing
I make you a fan, it's amusing
I make you a fan, it's amusing
Make you a fan, it's amusing
Make you a fan, it's amusing

[Verse 2: Nyck Caution]
Are you feeling me now?
Cause I'm feeling myself
And I made it to the building myself
Trying to make a living myself
Million, only as a minimum
I don't think a living might help
Yo, tell me if you're willing for the breakthrough
Can't relate to the snake in the fake [?]
Got racks? Think I don't relate?
Fuck it, I pay dues
Now I get paid cause I make moves
I ain't trying to be average
Get punched like a ad lib
Work to the callus, rip when shit happens
Keep balance, I be dying to eat, stay ravenous
Go grasp it
Pray to God no pathogens and no famine hit
I keep it real to the script, no challenges
It's [?], I'm a fucking protagonist
It's like you know me
I rep the EOE
Fuck with no cops, only trust the g-o-d
If I die before I wake it would be lowkey
The p-o-p-o shooting like COD
If you're gonna dance to the music
Listen to the words
Give a chance to the music
Ain't nobody give a damn when it's useless
Ain't nobody give a damn
