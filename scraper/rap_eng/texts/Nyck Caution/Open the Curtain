[Verse 1]
I just roll, so lost
I'm just so up north
Get my dick sucked off
And yo' bitch fucked raw
Dog, lost sword, often, they shotgun
The top-notch spot on lock, baby I got one
I spit it through the fire, desire to make a higher livin'
Yeah, I perspire and get rid of an entire mission
And my entire is shitting on all the competition
And now your bitch is sitting shotgun and the top is missing
Call that a victim, I christen all my writtens
Delivering it with spit
Shit, straight pissin' on this track, though
Listen to this mac, ho-pimpin'
So every glisten on Nyck
Due to the fact that I'm kickin', though
Rhyme so fine, and I'm gonna go grind
If you really wanna battle, you might catch a closeline
All these bitches use cells
By this dick I use petals to clap
King of this castle in rap
Look, yeah, I'mma go 'til I can't go no more
And flow 'til I can't flow no more
And strive for my dreams, to get this green like I was Bulbasaur
Oh, ho's on my scrotum, p-please get goin'
Cause the show's about to start, I put work in, open the curtain

[Refrain 1]
Just open the curtain
Bitch, just open the curtain

[Verse 2]
It be time to go when I go so sick
I climb the boat and go roll with fish
Yeah, that's how raw I am
Go hard, you saw me jam
Oh-oh flow
So cray with these bad fabuloso babes
Knowin' I'm flowin' so they posin' for the photos
Hey, this what I be livin' for
The same shit, I'm gettin' more
Bitches with these pedicures
Titties are spectacular
I'm the same group of kids you saw chillin' in the kiddy park
Now I'm in the city just to piss you off
You shut me down, but it's nothing', I love it
I'm always good off the top like a muffin
You frontin', that's how I go
Man, I just blister the system
I'm unforgivin' with this rippin', so stop bitchin' and listen like wait

[Refrain 2]
Stop bitchin' and listen
Bitch, just open the curtain

[Verse 3]
They callin' this the new law
Like fuck it, see, I been rhymin' raw since '94
Blowin' up like dinosuars
You keep a gynecologist to check your vaginas
Because you pussy, I smell it through the sinus
Katana blade slash, now you minus in half
Keep a stash of that hash in the back that we blast when we gassed
Jam-tight, yeah, you damn right, screamin' "fuck a gas price"
We still live a fast life

[Outro]
We still live a fast life
Yeah, LP
Alright, you can close the curtain now
