[Hook]
Finished with them gimmicks that you say
In it to begin it's great, and im finna say
What i wanna, lp the ones that run it into the track meet
Stop, and we gon go right up to the top with this one
The list starts now and it's our prescription
Write it down, Sirens in the crowd and you are not allowed in the Danger Zone

[Verse]
Go ahead girl, let that money drop
Pick it up, you gettin' 20 stop picturin' us, cause it's different trust
You ain't listenin' but I will take those earplugs out your ear
You fussin' cause (?)
And I doesn't wanna love it if it's something that is public yeah
Cause you ain't really that special and shit, no offensiveness but this is how my mental is
I write it down with pencil's, voice it on instrumentals
Releasin' it with saliva that travels straight from the temple
I'm gentle with barely anything, harder than a mother who notices a child's belly ring
Without permission granted, you see my vision slanted cause I'm from a different planet
What you do I triple, squeezin' on all the nipples, damnit, janet
Timberlake, I got all my (?) and I don't wanna give up till the sit up and released what they had missed up is NY CK, all about my cheesecake
On replay, I get on my freeway
I hope there is no police chase cause if they do then it'll be a sticky situation, I don't wanna get probation from a BJ, ah
Hold me down, yeah, I'm just too focused now
And these people who know me don't even know me now
I hope I'm cozy cause sleepin on me is lonely cause I stepped up
And now I'm the only thing that can hold me back
I ain't even old enough for cigarettes, but I'll smoke you
Opposite of hopeful you loco
I'm just fucking oh so crazy with the loaded clip flow
Watch me as I toast you
I'm local for now, but my vocal is loud and I will reach to the streets, keep them hopeful and proud
And don't think that I'm weak cause I'm whiter than smiles
Just listen to the words that I shout
Don't count out, even though you doubt
I'm the underdog trying to get above you now
Man I love my town I will never stand down
Hey what, look who became a fan now
If the crown is handed down can I put my hand up
Get one chance to show that I have what the game needs
We are not the same breed, like Jet Li
You cannot tame C
