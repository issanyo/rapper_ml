[Intro]
Out of reach

[Verse: Nyck Caution]
Let me tell you 'bout these words that I'm livin' by
Now you can plan this all you want but with life you gotta improvise
Cause shit can hit the fan in like a minute
But I promise that a suicide don't ever make it simplify
And I remember like it's yesterday
Its the coldest winter evening when that text message escalate
Like we don't even know his whereabouts
And yo that twitter got some crazy shit, it's something that we scared about
I tried to call but he was distant
And I ain't even seen him since the Stussy shirt drop
But PEEP started poppin' and the Era lookin' brighter than it ever did
But somethings changing, everything was so unsettling
Coming up within the month you started proving everybody your intelligence
Said it from the jump that our future was something relevant
World Domination, tell 'em we the fellowship
Shit was making sense but then Ali hit my phone
And told me he outside the door
So I grabbed my hoodie and got my keys, got up off the floor
In the car, nobody talked until we met up with the Pros by the park
We thought he was there but yo we can't find him
I was mad frightened, ain't no sign of STEEZ
I was trippin', thinkin', how can he be out of reach?
What happened to this life that we used to know?
Shit is real, way deeper than this music go
Then the phone rang, I think Joey answered
It's his sister crying, no one made a noise
Dropped it to the floor, said our homie passin'
All the brightness slightly died and was destroyed
The void

[Bridge]
Reaching out, 'cause I can feel you there

[Verse 2: Nyck Caution]
Let me tell you 'bout these words that I'm livin' by
Now you can plan this all you want but with life you gotta improvise
Cause shit can hit the fan in like a minute but I promise that
Yo I promise I'ma hold down for you Cap
I know its Capital but you the captain, that's a fact
And since you drifted, we've been lost just tryna bridge the gap
I miss the knit in fact
I miss your confidence, it's only right I've given back
'Cause once a vision implanted its infectious
Disguise the Limit
That's been imprinted out my message
Remember when you spit that, yo
Shit I thought you were a legend
And of course you manifested what you thought and I admire that
I was denying that it happened 'til they fired back
And everybody had a question which required that the truth be spoken
But I ain't even accept it, how we supposed to be progressive when our roots are broken
Yo, and you know I'd give you all of me
I swear that old fucking milk couldn't spoil me
I'ma always ride with you, 'til the day I lie with you
That's called loyalty
It's still loyalty
You know I'd give you all of me
I'ma always ride with you, 'til the day I lie with you
It's called loyalty

[Outro]
I'm reaching, reaching out
But I know that you're not there
You're not there

[Beat Switch]

[Intro: Alex Mali]
I can't wait
To get away from anything
Looking from the joints in my face
My heart beats faster in a regular place
See I'm not sure of what it is
I asked my mother to help me with this

[Verse: TheMIND]
Getting a little, too big for my britches
My shoes is starting to hurt my feet, as well as my fitted
They say my head getting bigger now
My bread getting bigger now
The clock ends with no man
It took time but a nigga blew up
Them niggas blew up
Them niggas knew us
They always said we'd be who we were
Be who you are, you know you a star
Now shine like one baby
Now shine like one baby
Now shine like one baby
