Still adding up my epiphanies
I shall abide to apply with all my abilities
Took all my alibis, bye for they lies when they tryna belittle me
Bid on me, guess you wanna see the bigger me

[Verse 6: Dirty Sanchez]
Chilling with the don and yeah it's war, put a hit on me
You can smoke all you want, all you want bitch, just don't fuck with my purp
I'm not finna work for no white man
Put that on my heart with my right hand
Latino heat, I do my dance
Watch money roll like that's my plan
I only hang with a gang full of leaders
I earned my stripes, pledge of allegiance
Fuck all my teachers, I'm hoping you see this
And everyone else that was non-believers
Sunshine and that knife in

Remember what was missing from the game
Audiopium, I'll probably be addicted forever
