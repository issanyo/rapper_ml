[Verse 1]
Yeah
Wake up
I assassinate these villains
Vaccinate my children
In the apple we be rotting
While I calculate a million
Break the shackle off my ankle
'cuz they tryna make me fit in
And there's them who know
That we rise for the resistance
Boom, you an imposter
I be getting bread of focaccia
Doctor, Betty Crocker, I spit improper
Laryngitis be the only obstacle
That's ever keeping me quiet inspired
Get a basket of bread
I see this traffic ahead (Work)
But my blunt is ashing instead
We got that sticky
Puffing out my vision, getting trippy, bands, give me 4 eyes like Mississippi your miss is with me
Lost living over cause giving
Mature women in the Porsche they riding around getting lost in it
And it's all tinted
Ain't no ventilation
Hotbox 'til I'm at my destination
And I tell you don't fuck with this
The young bandit with your bitch on my bucketlist
You say you balling I will Louisville slug your pitch
It’s like I’m teeing off Called up
Show you little leaguers I evolve
So now they pulled a Don Perry
So now they get my song ready used to have my palms sweaty
Now there’s no ignoring C
Fighting for the peace
I promise to give you all of me
Yeah
So take it all as a present mama
I break you off in a second Nah
So just put my weed into sections
And it’s on
And it’s on

[Bridge]
Can I say something?
Uhm, I'm the type of person
If you ask me a question and I don't know the answer
I'm gonna tell you that I don't know
I know how to find the answer and I will find the answer (yeah)
Is that fair enough?

[Verse 2]
Imma have to stop when I realize what I know
That you gotta go and have to aim for the top
Then your ceiling will explode
I’m dealing with the globe
And it’s balanced on my shoulders
I can never slip on my Pro shift you know this
And I be aware of what you set aside
You from a world I just can’t synthesis to set ‘em right
So when you step outside
Make sure you set your step and
You don’t ever mess with the threat that gon' keep your death in mind
I’m, asking for effort
Pass on my pleasure
Rap about happiness
Masking the pressure
I got this passion forever
Everlasting life that was supposed to happen together
But it’s lost in the distance
Lord, I’m forgiving
For any sin I plot, I just got to go get it
Until I ride and I’m finished
I will not stop. Why?
Cause the sky is the limit (yeah)
I’m disguising the limit
