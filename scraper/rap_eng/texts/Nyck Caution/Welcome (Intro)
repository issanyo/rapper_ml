[Intro]

[Verse 1]
Class is in session, this man is grasping a weapon
You'll get ripped in half and infected and left in bags
And we're just spending what we have, so get splendid
Or have your bitches rear-ended, And we just steer to clear edges, because I'm here
Man, what y'all doing cause I spit that, Mishap, better get back
Whip-whip-whip that, got a fit cap and a snap, and you're bitch ride in the back
But when I get flustered, you busters are nothing, while I'm just puffing
Accustomed to this all this love and rise from nada to something
And it's all what we thought it would be, I see the edge here
Lookie, I'm daring y'all to push me
I smash V-A-G till the day that I die
I get H-E-A-D all D-A-Y
Don't ever try to get on top of this, you'll lose like Metropolitans
I'm Yankee while you're following a bandwagon talking
I'm stomping, and this the life we living, far from common
And it's only the beginning, won't you give a listen?

[Outro]
Won't you give a listen? This is the beginning
WELCOME, WELCOME, WOW
