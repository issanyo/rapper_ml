[Intro: Nyck Caution]
Yeah, check, yo

[Verse 1: Nyck Caution]
I don't really sleep because I write a lot
Momma thinks I got some issues that I hide a lot
Walking through the ark, this is a path that many try to knock
So I be paranoid whenever dealing with this writer’s block
Exes wildin' cause they only get a dial
Probably in denial like "I know his phone on silent"
Girl you try a lot
And I can't knock it, but you always try to trap me in this V with a child lock
I swear to God that I'm too raw for this journal sentence
Just pray to God I ain’t too raw for these fertile bitches
Cause they be trynna catch me slipping, I'll admit
I had my chakras blinded by these lust demons I was fucking with
You wasn't really who you thought to be
I peep game Lil' mama, you was hustling
So why the fuck would I be willing to risk everything to share our bond
So you could leave with all this custody
I ain't a bastard and I ain't trynna make one
You're moving backwards, I about facing loose chapters
'Cause we a novel with no ending certain
And if I close the book, then no-one knows the road we took
We only just

[Hook: Nyck Caution & Kirk Knight]
Keep pushing, gotta keep pushing
Cause this isn't for me, I see through it
This is for real
I haven't seen you in two weeks
Why you, why you wanna meet up now and every night I loose sleep

[Verse 2: Nyck Caution]
Girl, it's hard to keep in touch with cha', I  can't put up with cha'
(Cause everytime I think I've had enough with cha')
You just flipped a picture like, you was moving much quicker
(He's a go getter)
You should probably fuck with him
But instead you fucked with him uncommitted, you dumb with it
(I be, I be gone)
In a hot minute, you can see me on my stove, pot spinning
I ain't gonna stop grilling, 'till I get my spot filled in
Yeah, said I be growing up fast, we are not children
Can you act like you're a old enough?
Hold me down, or just let it loose
You forget the truth
And I was chosen for this life, I ain't get to choose
But I know that I'll remember you
No matter what this revenue intends to do
I make millies, snakes in they gillies
Drop a stake through their eyes, make that mistake if you willing
Girl, you're tripping, and I ain't got no baggage left
And after all the damage, all we have is just embarassment
And I ain't trynna see you cutting your wrist
This the deepest and the verse is like the words for you to fix
But the hospital got stitches
And it's possible you'll find another solid who can guide you  through the solitude you slipped in

[Hook: Nyck Caution & Kirk Knight]
Keep pushing, gotta keep pushing
Cause this isn't for me, I see through it
Breathe
This is for real
I haven't seen you in two weeks
And every night I loose sleep

[Outro: Alex Mali]
Oh I need you Lord
Lord
