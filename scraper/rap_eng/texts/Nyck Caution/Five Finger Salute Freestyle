[Verse 1: Nyck Caution]
When the beat drop, I'mma go hard
Shut the spot down when the show start, yeah
Used to show love when they played me
Now I gotta, now I gotta stone heart, uh
I don't give a fuck what you say, B
Told me I was never gonna go far
Used to show love when they played me
Now I gotta, now I gotta stone heart, uh
Not one flow, little bitch, I got lyrics
When it's cold out, I rock layers
Lookin' for me in the club and the little kid is not there
I be in the studio, this is my lair
Bruce Wayne, Kirk, Alfred, Beast Coast
Liu Kang, always fly kicks with the outfit
Said she love how the sound hit
Ask her what the mouth do
And you know she showed me what the mouth did
At the world like an asteroid
I might get tense when I act annoyed
My move might switch and this dude might split your wig
I'm feelin' like James McAvoy
They want a war with me, no doubt
Throw a couple shots that you can't avoid
It's illogical to fuck with this drill sergeant
Troops that you can't avoid
Truth is that I can't enjoy how the game switched up
Man's not a fan of the decoy, uh
Kill streak, lookin' at the recon
Any time, you know they gettin' destroyed
Super Saiyan 2 when the beat's on
Young team go hard, you the android
I heard I was playin' on the cellphone
It was me that was blowin' up the Android
When the beat drop, I'mma go hard
Ask Sway every time, I'mma go far, yeah
Used to show love when they played me, uh
Now I gotta, now I gotta stone heart, uh
I don't give a fuck what you say, B
Stay fly, I don't even rock Goyard, uh
Used to get love when they played me, uh
Now I gotta, now I gotta stone heart, uh

[Interlude: Sway & Kirk Knight]
Aaaaaaaah!
Go on the next beat
Yo, we not done yet!
Yeah, uh
Sway in the Morning, Nyck Caution, Kirk Knight
Ah, Nyck @ Knight, get the project, it's out now

[Verse 2: Kirk Knight]
Yeah, yeah
I been way too stressed, I let the pen stroke
I'm from a place where they put you on a white shirt
And sugar, honey, iced tea's what that ass worth
Fast life is a drug, baby, they lovin' the perks
Came from under the dirt, y'all came from under the skirts
And that's a different type of build, I'm just puttin' [?]
And that's lovin' memory of STEEZ when I'm spittin' a verse
Say my nigga name in vain, boy, don't get on my nerves
I'm supernatural when I'm smokin' the earth
And I know life's a bitch, I've been learnin' the curves
So all eyes on me, like I'm most wanted
Hot boy and he real chill, he a cold-hearted
I was blessed with a shot, I was point guarded
Like a fight broke out, the way the noise started
Yeah, Brooklyn need to check on the state of mind
Smokin' on that sour D, got my crown fire
Man, we get high to get by, Flatbush to Bed-Stuy
Crown Heights, my cool flies, uh
I'm a legend, boy, all I see is green lights
Never gon' stop, even if I see the D'Lites
And I got a…nice chocolate delight
Always gotta remind her that I don't bite
Everything is original, steal the show like a criminal
Singin' the songs, think I'm Biblical
Yo, it's a ritual
Me and Nyck be in the stu' and I know that it's killin' you
Uh, smoke the weed individual
Yo, I'm that real individual
Yo…uh, hol' up, hol' up, hol' up

[Interlude: Sway]
Sway in the Morning, Nyck @ Knight
They in here
Kirk Knight, kill the flow, he's in the zone, he's in the zone!

[Verse 3: Kirk Knight]
Yo, yo, look, uh
I think I reached my ten thousandth hour
I never had a nine-to-five, still banked on allowance
And that was self-made, never begged my pa when [?]
Now four years later, I'm thinkin' 'bout accountants
Was that five forty station, makin' beats
Just a double [?] from JAY-Z, oh, look at me
Fuckin' fine ass freak, every day of the week
Now it's back to the basics with my nigga Sway C
Uh, and that was just a little Novocaine to ease the pain
Like, fuck the money and the fame, I just need a name
Like every story…can't be the same
Somethin' like the black [Chris Collar?], nigga steady aim
They don't like blacks proceedin' with other brothers
So said, "Fuckin' need money to cover the skin color," and
Show these motherfuckers new face of the loot
Watch me fuck up the game and make that whole shit reboot, nigga
Put your hands up in the sky, ay
Put your hands up in the sky, ay
If you feelin' up my vibe, ay
Put your hands up in the sky

[Interlude: Kirk Knight, Nyck Caution and Sway]
We live!
Yeah, yeah, said we live
Yeah, we live
Ay, now we live, ay
Said we live, ay, yeah we live
Ay, said we live, uh, yeah
(Beat stops)
Oh, wha…oh
We not live?
One more time, let that beat rock, get that off
(Beat restarts)
Yeah, ay
Uh, we got Jeff Bridges up next, I'm lettin' Nyck get that off
I said we live one more time and we live one more time and we live one more time, ay

[Verse 4: Nyck Caution]
Check it, yeah, uh
The game is weird, I bring it back to the roots
Five fingers of death, so five finger salute
The fuckin' general, if my team ask me to shoot
I'll blast at 'em till every last atom is out the loop
Who the fuck are you? All my enemies, I hope you die pathetic
Was thinkin' positivity but fuck it, I regret it
I don't want to  sugarcoat it, you talk when I be present
I'm fuckin' diabetic, that is not in my genetics
Why should I be present? Yeah
Why should I wait when I know it's time to get it?
Some people live for the hypothetics, get excited from a thought
Then do some other shit, they fuck around and might forget it
Who knows what that could've became?
Every flame starts with a spark if the spark's uncontained
Let it breathe, you'll never know what you'll find
Unconfined, the hunger is in his eyes
The older I get, the younger I feel inside
Maybe the lost boy found what he couldn't find
Yeah, everyday I enter my prime
I guess I'm just ahead of my time

[Outro: Kirk Knight & Sway]
Aaaaaaaaaaah!!
