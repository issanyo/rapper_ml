Is this the jam right here? (5x)
Cause it's feeling like the jam right here

[Verse 1: Dessy Hinds]
When they asked a nigga how be been with rapping
How you make it with rapping?
I been rolling out more joints more early than niggas trapping
Was never slacking
But since you think I was gone then I'm back in
Made a pact from rapping and never be caught slacking
With the crew
Eighty five percent of the time gotta step it up
Cutting records ain't the deal
Unless they getting infected cuts
Straight from the guts and gutters from one another
Dessy Hinds spit on the mic but never will he stutter
It's true
They wanna love us but I only trust my mother
Gotta keep your mind sharper than the knives they use to hunt ya
So go on and rock your rubbers
With these scheming ass chicks
Cause these dimes be tryna get the quick dollar that be making sense
Use to be watching Clark Kent fly with inner inhibitions
Found out the most true type of hero the game was missing
Spitting crack instead of cooking it
Up in my nigga's kitchen
Was always driven to sit and listen
And write my description

[Hook]
It's so natural, natural my nigga
It's so natural, natural
You ask me how do I write in the purest form of rhymes
These times I let my speakers blast and my teachers laugh combine
But once the sound hit your spine and the lyrics touch your mind
It's like not thinking to help come up with these rhymes
So natural, natural my nigga completely natural
It's not your style my nigga

[Interlude: NYCk Caution]
Yo, it's NY, yo

[Verse 2: NYCk Caution]
We trying to keep a low profile
They check the pros [?]
A change flow style from a same old child
To a insane go rascal, I aim for castles
Base your facts off past battles
If I lost I wouldnâ€™t be here
Caught up in the streets to bust, arsenal seeker
Yeah it be grotesque
And yeah I be no less than amazing
Coming from the basement
Now im standing next to agents
Swanking in my fastest sneakers
Striped and adidas
Knife [?] bright light random theaters
Phantom plan procedure
Cause you can't stand the reefer
Couple hits will have you sleeping like a anesthesia
Jealousy killed him, missed the felony children
Raising hell in the building
Refugees filled them, [?]
Not like we been in America first
But we cherish our blessing and keep forgetting the curse

[Hook]
It's so natural, natural my nigga
It's so natural, natural
You ask me how do I write in the purest form of rhymes
These times I let my speakers blast and my teachers laugh combine
But once the sound hit your spine and the lyrics touch your mind
It's like not thinking to help come up with these rhymes
So natural, natural my nigga completely natural
It's not your style my nigga

[Verse 3: Dessy Hinds]
Was always walkin' past the avenues
Where I used to battle crews
Tactics, like battling
Battleships to the battling crews
Told my momma relax too
We feeling to get this good life
And I'mma wear it out like good mics on a good night
Good times, you know I got good rhymes
From the age of five wrote on a page got on the stage, wise
On the illest crew at times
The Progressive Era times
Rapping is like mathematics that these rappers can't figure out
So listen and learn
I'm steadily trying to figure out mine
CJ favorite line; Dessy in due time
But the whole Era know these bars gonna make me do time
I'm too kind, but the flow mean I guess that's two kinds
My crew's been syndicated
Always had the plans to make it
Never had the fear to not take it
Never had no relations
That's blessed with pure talent
With no absolute way out
So been in the booth and mentally never came out

[Hook]
It's so natural, natural my nigga
It's so natural, natural
You ask me how do I write in the purest form of rhymes
These times I let my speakers blast and my teachers laugh combine
But once the sound hit your spine and the lyrics touch your mind
It's like not thinking to help come up with these rhymes
So natural, natural my nigga completely natural
It's not your style my nigga
