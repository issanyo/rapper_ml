Super fly
Y'all just superficial
Focus on the problem, y'all saw the issue
Nycky, seen all that
Blow the whistle, no contest, word to my two initials
Back like I never left, you should never doubt
Yeah I been black [?]
What I told them, y'all travel around America
Real shit, follow the leader
They just be talking behind but wouldn't dare when I'm near
They ain't scared, but the fear
Homie say that I'm doing better than the thought of anything [?]
Your career is unclear
My profession is rhythm
I disappeared in a year
So don't question the vision
This is everything I wanted so the second I could get
I'ma pounce on it if you gonna doubt
I'ma have to dub that, yeah
I'ma have to dub that, yeah
Talking on that chit chat, blah blah, I don't got time
Not, really about time that you find out
I'm about to wild out, got my third eye out
See me on the track anytime that it's lights out
I been up like all night
I don't know what the time, [?] what you rhyming about
I don't really feel it at all
Heard your new shit, every single damn rap lane got this new dope
Yeah I'm finna Call Saul
I'm the Walter White of the rap game, always got crack man
Kill the show every night, live for the highs, live through the lows
Yeah you know, I'ma put 'em in the dirt
Work, A$AP, New York City about time we embrace that
I been on for a minute, but it's about to get lit right now
In the age of the limits, no age, no limit
Get paid go spend it
Been around the world, little kid you ain't telling me shit
2015 about to answer my means, and the rest of y'all, y'all just average
I'm a Pro, put the rookies in a casket
I collect souls like they ransom
Only got select calls that I answer
And this bitch ain't one of them
Real shit, I don't ever got love for them
A lot of whack shit gonna circulate
You gonna learn today, Nyck ain't one of them
40-47 no love for the government
47 lord knows we the governing
With the city on our back
Get it? Get a little bit of shine you won't ever get it back
The limit is the sky, see the light through the cracks like

See the light through the cracks
See the light through the cracks
I disguise
I see the light through the cracks
I see the light through the cracks
I see the light through the cracks
I see the light through the cracks
Disguise the Limit, coming real, real soon
Real, real soon
I see the light through the cracks real soon
Through the cracks
Real, real, real soon
Through the cracks see the light
