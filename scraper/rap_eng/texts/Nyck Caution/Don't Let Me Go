Watch my back so I make sure
You're right behind me as before
Yesterday the night before tomorrow
Dry my eyes so you won't know
Dry my eyes so I won't show
I know you're right behind me

And don't you let me go, let me go tonight
Don't you let me go, let me go tonight
Don't you let me go, let me go tonight
Don't you let me go, let me go tonight
Don't you let me go, let me go tonight
Don't you let me go, let me go tonight

(Verse 1: Nyck Caution)
I thought I made it obvious
But you be chilling like a snobby bitch
I'm in the lobby of your building
Ringing on the door, you're behind it
I could hear you breathing and crying a little (?)
What I hear, man this bitch caught a big top
Gave you my living and this how you're going to live?
Without the man who support you
Get someone to escort you before
I do myself, and I suffer with a lawsuit
I ain't trying to assault you
But talking is never solving shit
Because what's little turns into a fucking argument
You always starting shit so I'm never calm
We can't catchup so we relish, like a mother fucking condiment
Was this condom in?
Or did I hit it raw?
I was faded from the bar
And when we got back to the crib
I didn't mean to get involved
But one thing lead to another
And her panties hit the floor
So here you standing by the door
Cops on the way, you can't stand this anymore
Maybe I'm the same
We could work it out
Baby I'm just hopeful for a change
But all you do is resist, and speaking of all this pain
I know that this shit hurt
Trust me I feel this burden too
And that person that you love is not loving you
I know that shit hurt, I feel the burden too
Baby, I'm always going to be in love with you

And don't you let me go, let me go tonight
Don't you let me go, let me go tonight
Don't you let me go, let me go tonight
Don't you let me go, let me go tonight
Don't you let me go, let me go tonight
Don't you let me go, let me go tonight

(Verse 2: Nyck Caution)
Breaking promises
And you be sleeping on the kid like pajamas did
Yeah, you said that you would never change
But a fucking taste of an adult
Turned you into an asshole
Do you remember what it's Christmas?
You happy with your fam, and got granted all of your wishes
Now you older and you standing with some bitches
And your parents making efforts
But you mind your fucking business
Listen, look
Before you know it you'll be older as fuck
I see my mom looking at me like I told her I
Must move on
Fucking timings a bitch
Remember lunch?
When I was just rhyming and shit
And trying to find me a chick
But they be lying and shit
But I supply them with dick
That they be dying to lick
But I be crying and shit
With no eyes on nyck
The fucking pressure to stick
And snort lines of this shit
Got me feeling like a bitch
Because I say no
I only do lines when I spit
Rather than selling all this crack and coke
I just rap and hope
That my shit is half as dope
So if you following what I'm preaching
Maybe you can make it through the evening
I gave you every reason to doubt
Still I'm keeping a mouth
And imma keep talking until they figure me out

And don't you let me go, let me go tonight
Don't you let me go, let me go tonight
Don't you let me go, let me go tonight
Don't you let me go, let me go tonight
Don't you let me go, let me go tonight
Don't you let me go, let me go tonight

Watch my back so i make sure
You're right behind me as before
Yesterday the night before tomorrow
