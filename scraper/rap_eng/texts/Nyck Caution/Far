[Verse 1: Nyck Caution]
All that liquor in my cup
She hope I don't absorb it
Lost up in the stars, see my office in this orbit
Got the green by the jar, now I'm chillin in my rocket
Always on our fly shit, so no compromising with the pilots
I'm telling you it's a go
Everything difficult
Women want physical, but never gon' listen
It's not my fault if you'll be broken
Tears are gonna splash, and we can never last if you not focused
And I'm always thinking of you and I love you but it's not the right time
And I would put nothing above you put I gotta go and free my mind

[Hook: T'Nah Apex & Kirk Knight]
So in the mean time imma get up on this life right now
Imma grind until my momma live a nice life now
And after that, imma come back
And if you still here then I would love that
If you still here then imma come back
If you still here then imma come back
A diamond in the rough, so rough
Misery loves company, when it's only me and you
I know your soul is bumping me but I can train you for the que
Yeah I can't be here right now our universe is only two
But I love you it's just not the right time
I said Misery loves company, when it's only me and you
I know your soul is bumping me but I can train you for the que
Yeah I can't be here right now our universe is only two
DAMN DAMN DAMN DAMN DAMN DAMN DAMN DAMN

[Verse 2: Nyck Caution]
Back up in this shit like, I was on my single shit
This could be a single, but I don't want you to hear it baby
I wanna clear it, I just need some clearance
Disappear and then you get it twisted
Back when I was younger, you tried to pull me under
Never thought I'd get it but I got it
Now this is my life and I can store you in this pocket
But there's never pressure to go say that would be selfish
But you should know a downgrade as if you were someone elses
Never could portray these emotions until you felt it
Now I feel em' bottle all these feelings

[Hook]

[Outro: Dirty Sanchez]
We just need some space and that's nothing to avoid
(Void Void Void, uh)
Can you feel it?
(Feel it, feel it)
Why? Cause I can feel it
(Feel it feel it) High
We just need some space and that's nothing to avoid
(Void Void Void)
It's deja-vu It's deja-vu
It's dirty
