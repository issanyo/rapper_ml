(Intro)
It's fucking lit

(Nyck Caution)
Hook:
And that's for sure (yeah)
That's for sure (yeah)
I said that's for sure

(Verse 1)
It's like the game moving crazy for a minute now
Rappers turn to bitches
I just burn a swisher
Light another when it flicker out
It's nyck caution rep the era rep it large
Drop bombs on you rappers causing terror for your squad
Yeah we fatter than ever
Lean them back on the rack
Make it rain with the rhythm
Always dropping that crack
Church hit in the head caution been in the lab
They try to play me in the past i'm just playing them back
I'd be out of the state
Living life in Croatia
Teacher told me if i rap it'd be my biggest mistake
Now i'm visiting my high school i look at her face
This bitch sick to her stomach
I pray i never relate
I pray i never come down
I pray on anbody if they ever think
For like a second imma play in this game
5-8, 140 lil caution still a shorty
Still a giant on this mic, it's still a storm when I'm recording
This the quiet before the storm
