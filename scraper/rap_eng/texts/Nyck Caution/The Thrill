[Verse: 1]
Man if you got yourself thrills, go and seek it man
I ain't got no deals but i need it but i need it
I will hold you to your words, i stand you by your actions
Keep it rolling til that hurts got me locked up in a casket
Go and throw it up that money falling from wherever
They toss it up for fun but we ballin' with this cheddar
These girls half naked with all types of liquor and we ready for whatever while we rule out all these measures
Let me go let me go and do not hold me back make it through the storm no regrets but well forget it in the morn
I'm a youngin' for a reason on a come up who believes in everything hes doing but still fucked up on the weekends
For the fun of it
I love this shit grinding till I'm hovering and i ain't put in work so i could end up with like none of it
I'm just trying to make a mill of it mill of it but it ain't about money I'm just living for the thrill of it

[verse: 2]
Yea uh so
