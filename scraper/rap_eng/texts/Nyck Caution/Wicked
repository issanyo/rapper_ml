Yeah, Yeah
I don't give a fuck, I don't give a fuck
Back in it, I don't give a fuck

[Verse 1: Nyck Caution]
Check!
Why you actin' up?
I throw you in the acura
& Tell the cops that you were just a passenger
Gas mask thrown over your head
The fumes leave you covered up
In 47 swaastikas or swastikas, I'm popular
Time to get my profit up, Open up these chakras
Rockin' out in Arkansaw, Tall down in Florida
So if you take my capitol, I'm cappin' you
An axe'll do me well, put a slash in you
I got that backwards cat, caskets
For you asses, and put acid on your flacid tracks
You not in Kansas anymore & my stance is metaphors
I be rippin' through the can
Land you on the floor
Take that cancer through your pores
Then inhale it cause I'm ill
Dangerous, enflamin' shit
An artist who's an arsonist
Restrainin' him is prolly gonna be...
Somethin' that you want, bow and arrow flow like im katniss
Madlib, my tracklist
I swear to gotti, feels like I got it
Mills half off, come & chill on this island
Alright, you fronters lacerated
All my people tax evadin'
So they make invalid statements
Balances decapitated
Im goin' in
It's apparent, I'm a parent
Cause I'm Daddy to you ferrets
While you battlein and swearin'
& I'll casually inherit, these casualties that I'm sparin'
We must be at the top, cause clarity dissappearin' ah! (Nah!)

This is practice, I'm wicked at this
This is practice, I'm wicked at this
This is practice, I'm wicked at this

I survive with my tactics, the fact is

This is practice, I'm wicked at this
This is practice, I'm wicked at this
This is practice, I'm wicked at this

We pick the atlas up & kill the bastards

I don't give a fuck, I don't give a fuck
Back in it, I don't give a fuck
