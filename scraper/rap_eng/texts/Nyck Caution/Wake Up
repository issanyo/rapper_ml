[Intro: Nyck Caution & Kirk Knight]
Yeah, I finally found my way up
Now I gotta stay up
The game slowed down
Every shot a layup
It make you wanna blaze up? (Yea)
Get your cake up, you sleep, we on the wake up
Wake up

[Verse 1: Nyck Caution & Kirk Knight]
'Til the day I die, I'll be running through the system like a virus
Silence when I grace you with the style that keep you vibin'
I've been, riding 'round the city with my vibrant
Chick that keep me lit like the city I reside in
And my theory on this game when O.G.s asks "What's the science?"
Stay on my job without one, been a home appliance
I live the dream and my nightmares helped me outThe Midas, touch the pen, striking gold thought I was a minor

[Chorus: Nyck Caution & Kirk Knight]
So wake the fuck up! And get ya cash up
Just keep your eyes on the snakes, make sure ya grass cut
I put the mask on, I bring the bag out
So get the fuck back! And sit your ass down
See I go in the booth, And I just black out
You hiding from the truth, I always lay the facts down
Now I'ma class act, used to be a class clown
Didn't choose the fast route, I worked to where I am now

[Verse 2: Nyck Caution & Kirk Knight]
Gotta count ya blessings before they fade away
Stay away from people that prevent you from the great escape
They try to dock me but I swear I wouldn't stay in bay
My pen heavy, only anchor on me, what this paper make
This that soul music, nigga turn me up some
Thinking light years ahead I can feel the buzz
Eyes dilated, see the up and up
And every blessing count nigga just keep it a buck
Been the bigger man since I had a sippy cup
So many dead homies, nigga forced to run it up
Stay on track knowing that it's never enough
Learning how to pull a card, pull any would bluff
Got a couple of the queens on lay away
Got a couple dumb niggas checking me today
Got that Ace in the hole, more bottles of Spades
Rappers days numbered nigga, I'm gunning for king

[Outro: Nyck Caution & Kirk Knight]
I finally found my way up
Now I gotta stay up
The game slowed down
Every shot I layup
It make you wanna blaze up? (Yea)
Get your cake up, You sleep, we on the wake up
Wake up
