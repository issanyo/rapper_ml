[Verse 1: Nyck Caution]
Yo, half the world is watchin every movement that you make
When you eatin, they be scrappin' for the scraps all on yo plate
And when you don't got time they say this rappin' made you fake
Actually I try to just inhabit what I talked about
When we would walk around, before I lost an ounce
I let you know I had this plan that I would hold you down
I explained it so elaborate I would train to know the labyrinth
Make it in a maze, like I have been
Haven't seen you lately, hope that you're invading all the demons in your shadows
Just keep on escapin'
Seasons can't relate, and in the spring I'm feeling crazy
Now there's no more presence of your spirit so this spittin' that's replaced what you've given to create me
I'm driving with no safety your insurance just this feeling I'm pursuin, it's a risk but I did it
But I can't share it wit ya
I say goodbye already but my brain don't care to listen
I won't remain no victim, but ever since I got a taste
My appetite increased I can't explain the switch-up
Some people love me but the ones that probably claim to differ
Want to see me fall down, never paint a picture
Never drop an album
I hear your gossip and I always think that if I put the mic down it would stop it
Right now i'm on top of it, but I feel the opposite
I just got a question ain't nobody been acknowledgin'

[Hook: Nyck Caution]
If I was somebody
Who was nobody
Would you still
Be here for me, be here for me?
Yo
If I was somebody
Who was nobody
Would you still
Be here for me, be here for me?

[Verse 2: Nyck Caution]
This college asking me for more cash
I ignore, dashin' passed it I ain't tryna see this form passin'
Years of sittin' in this motherfucking core class
Tryna get my bored ass pour like the forecast is
Swear I'm done with that school shit
You dropped out too, guess I'm back on my youth shit
These old faces back on these blues
Like a saxophone user I'm cracked up in the middle can't react and don't do shit
That's a weapon and that's something you do
I hope your efforts beg to differ but my trust is removed
Now this guilt is like a pool stick
On cue every time I keep the truth zipped
Loose grip like I'm toothless, already lost Chris
Yeah, probably why I'm so cautious
Wish you never left, but then my records would express the lesser elements
(Rest)

[Hook: Nyck Caution]
If I was somebody
Who was nobody
Would you still
Be here for me, be here for me?
Yo
If I was somebody
Who was nobody
Would you still
Be here for me, be here for me?

[Bridge: Nyck Caution]
I think its best you just breathe
I think its best you just, I think its best you just
Breathe
I think its best you just breathe
Nothin' less than what you need
Breathe

[Verse 3: Tyler Sheritt]
Is there somebody out there? Cause I'm feeling weak
Its like I feel you around me, but there's no one to see
And I've been waitin' a long time, its out of control
Is there somebody out there?

[Outro: Nyck Caution]
Like I never had no record deal, I'm independent and I'm dealing with this pressure still
Always think that if I did it, everything would be different
And I'd always have you in my presence still
