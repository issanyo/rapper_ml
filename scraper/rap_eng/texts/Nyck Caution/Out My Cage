[Intro]
They finally let me out my cage

[Verse]
Nyck know what time it is
Bitch just freeze get down like the climate is
Over on my side, it's not that inspirin'
But you make your own that bed that you lyin' in
But who you lyin' to? Your shit fake fam
Your shine spray tanned, make my mind cave in, pardon the particles
This is just the pain when you raised and the rest is barnacles, you a made man
And I'll be ready for whatever you got, I'm a Pro though
Yeah, this is promo
Yeah, in the zone though
Yeah, when I'm alone though
Yo I stay low to these motherfuckin' hoes no photos
Uh, I got minds, I got people in my life
I got problems in my mind, that shit happens all the time
I got, thing I got to deal with on the daily
And in the past year, yeah, most of that changed me
Super high, I be ashin' on the ceiling
Forever doesn't last within the feeling
Not everybody got the chance you got
So with a shot you better own it because everybody leasin'
This hobby decent, now this cash flow comin'
After last year I learned about them assholes huntin'
And I don't wish you any downfall
But it's like that sound keep buzzin' 'til this capsule plummet
And I got it, yeah
Oh I got it to a point to make them understand the pieces don't break if you solid
And all your people just snakes in disguises but it's different 'cause I really can't relate no more
'Cause you gon' get the cold shoulder, I know you low-blowers
Be sneakin' actin' like you ain't bite the old flow-er
No doubt it's new level, switch styles, got several
Get rowd', raise hell, it's Pro Era forever
Yeah, yeah
It's Pro Era
It's Pro Era
Switch styles, got several
You gon' get the cold shoulder

[Hook]
Yeah, I said they finally let me out my cage
I broke the locks to get you out the way
It's all the game and y'all don't wanna play
Whether that's with music or in 2K
I might blow up today, or fall off tomorrow
Would you still be on the phone if I called you talk
Or would you find somebody else to share my song with?
Yeah they finally let me out my cage
I broke the locks to get you out my way
Yeah, it's all a game and y'all don't wanna play
Whether that's with music or in 2K
I might blow up today, or fall off tomorrow
Would you still be on the phone if I called you talk
Or would you find somebody else to share my song with?
