[Intro]



[Verse 1: Nyck Caution]

This white boy trying to rap, he simply can’t fit in
Even if he’s fresh and he spits the best written
Free style good, where the flaws at, no where
They say I shouldn’t do it, but guess who wants to go there
I want to make it, but I’m segregated
Every time I say a line, my past is investigated
Because I did shows at my school
And my grades aren’t foolish
Never shot a gun, so I guess I’m not the coolest
Of course, I know I’m good, but I’m striving for the best
Because good don’t pay the bills, I’m striving for success
And Chris dying had me crying over stress
And when nothing is going right
It’s probably because he left
But, I’m trying to stay strong
And boost my fucking confidence
Not too many compliments, fuck it with my consciousness
I want to go on tours on these continents
Answer my accomplishments, finish up this college shit
And this music is my escape, in a life where I’m wrong
This is where I’m feeling great
This is something that’s forever
And it’s nothing that you can take
Because I’ll die over music, collide with you snakes
You can never say I won’t, and never say I ain’t
Because I am, and I’ll show that this shit is my fate
I know I can’t get everyone’s love
But I’m counted out before I even open my mouth
Yeah, my dad walking out, he left me with my mother
And I suffered stressing out
Because our money game is clustered
My teenage years, I experienced the loss
Of my two best friends, my dad and a brother
Talk about being smothered
Yeah, yeah, look, but these were things
That I had no control of
Like dad relapsing, something that I didn’t know of
The Jet Ski crash, almost made me want to throw up
My crew sniffing coke, man, please pick your nose up
I had to hold up, thinking through twice
Should I pop pills cool, and throw away my life
I knew it wasn’t right, but I saw my friends drifting
And I told them all to stop
But of course they didn’t listen
I’m a young man spittin’ not old enough to vote
But I’m old enough to think, and I’m old enough to hope
That my future will be brighter and the struggles I [?]
And I won’t be sticking needles, but my songs will be dope
Nope, I guess I got to do me, don’t like it, you can sue me
You can take everything away, if it’ll make your day
But never will I cry, you can take away my pride
Yeah I’m supreme like judicial, I’m trying to make it big
Have the fans scream initials
NC baby is as legit as it get
Like relationships being made Facebook official
They say I’m like the rest of you kids
But man, I ain’t nothing like the rest of you kids
Then they tell me I ain’t shit to the rest of you kids
But fact is I will shit on the rest of you kids
They say you got to own it once you get a chance
A wise man said lose yourself in the moment
So any fuckin' chance that I get
I will spit until I shit
And rip the fuckin’ ass off opponents
I’m striving for the golden globes
Man, I’m hoping sold out seats at shows
Me performing, start storming, raining on my forehead
Fans don’t leave, they support him
Uh, shit is better, I’m talkin’ to my pops
He believes in me, thinking that I’m going to the top
Ah, I tell him that nobody can stop me
[?] like my name is Bill Cosby
Yeah, they talkin’ all this shit about me
But think about how the rap game would be without me
Better than the rest but y’all doubt me
I can only be the best if you allow me
Baby just allow me, yeah
