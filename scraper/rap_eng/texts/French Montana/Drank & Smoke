Dranked up, smoked up, dranked up, smoked up

Acting like a bitch who me, no never
I'ma get up ground chase this money forever
You rocking with the best, but one can do it better
She talking too fast, this is what I tell her
Pour it up, roll it up
Shawty do it too fast then she slow it up
Pour it up, roll it up
Shawty do it too fast then she slow it up

Rolling carters 2 meters of that loud 2
Speakers, 4 ounces 2 leaders of that drank
Fucking thang, in that ... me and Mac
Shawty mean, going in, quarter back
Going deep, need a plat
I be platinum with that pussy worldwide
Everything you did we done did it 4 time
You balling then I missed it
I did it and I switched it
I curbe them when I'm sober
And hit it when I'm twisted
I'm dipping down the ocean hitting walls and curbing corners
Swerving in that space ship, all the bitches they be on us
Acting like a whore, who, me, no never
Purple drink I pour, no one do it better

Acting like a bitch who me, no never
I'ma get up ground chase this money forever
You rocking with the best, but one can do it better
She talking too fast, this is what I tell her
Pour it up, roll it up
Shawty do it too fast then she slow it up
Pour it up, roll it up
Shawty do it too fast then she slow it up

Shawty how ya been, I love the way you pour me up
You hate it when I sip it but I love it when you pour me up
Just another cup girl I don't think I'm moving slow enough
Fuck these out of town hoes, I'm sticking with my local love
Baby can you sleep the phone sleeping we can miss the morning
A bb gun to my rifle be a Christmas story
Yeah, she pull me closer when she feeling horny
And I ain't worry bout them other dudes who here before me
This gonna be sex something that I'm surer
Girl I dig your energy, I'm fucking with your aura
And morning kill ourselves, when I open all my doors up
Suicide, and this my car but baby you can drive cause I'm fucked up
Leaning in the passenger, you don't fuck musicians
Baby girl just let me rap to you, drop me at the crib
Show you where I live, I ain't worried
Just know your bullshit don't concern me

Acting like a bitch who me, no never
I'ma get up ground chase this money forever
You rocking with the best, but one can do it better
She talking too fast, this is what I tell her
Pour it up, roll it up
Shawty do it too fast then she slow it up
Pour it up, roll it up
Shawty do it too fast then she slow it up
