[Intro]
Niggas done changed, goddamn (huh, fuck)
Now I'm gettin' all this change, goddamn
Done changed, goddamn, see all the chains, goddamn
La Musica de Harry Fraud
...goddamn

[Chorus]
If I think a nigga did it on purpose (purpose)
I'ma hit him in the face on purpose (on purpose)
If I catch 25, it was worth it (it was worth it)
Get the fuck from 'round me if you nervous (if you nervous)
G-g-grew up on the block with the drug lords (drug lords)
They give a fuck about a gun charge (gun charge)
Catch 1-3 and do the service (do the service)
Get the fuck from 'round me if you nervous (ayy)

[Verse 1]
G-g-grew up on the block with the drug lords (drug lords)
I turned the roof into a Lamb'
I turned a brick from a gram (gram)
I built a castle from the sand (sand)
My homie might die in the pen' though
My mama dry clothes out the window (window)
Dope boy ridin' with extendo (extendo)
Youngin' sellin' dope for a Benzo
S-s-see a young nigga floss (floss)
Movin' like a boss (like a boss)
Spun around the block in the Lambo (Lambo)
Hangin' off the halls like Rambo (skrrt)
Cut another nigga through the dash
F-f-fuck about shit, coulda had
Put a gram of winter in a cab (cab)
Chef boy Izza in the lab (in the lab)

[Pre-Chorus]
Made it from the block, goddamn (goddamn)
I done earned my spot, goddamn (goddamn)
Sippin' blue dot, goddamn (goddamn)
Shorty made it hot, goddamn (goddamn)
Shit done changed, goddamn (goddamn)
Now I'm gettin' all this change, goddamn (goddamn)
You see all these chains, goddamn (goddamn)
Niggas done changed, goddamn (goddamn)

[Chorus]
But if I think a nigga did it on purpose (on purpose)
I'ma hit him in the face on purpose (on purpose)
If I catch 25, it was worth it (it was worth it)
Get the fuck from 'round me if you nervous (nervous)
G-g-grew up on the block with the drug lords (grew up on the block with the drug lords)
They give a fuck about a gun charge (give a fuck about gun charge)
Ca-ca-catch 1-3 and do the service (catch 1-3 and do the service)
Get the fuck from 'round me if you nervous (fuck from 'round me if you nervous)

[Bridge]
Yeah, fuck from 'round me if you nervous
Get the-get the-get the fuck from 'round me if you nervous
(Fuck from 'round me if you nervous)
Get the-get the-get the fuck from 'round me if you nervous
(Fuck from 'round me if you nervous)
Yeah, fuck from 'round me if you nervous
Get the-get the-get the fuck from 'round me if you nervous
Catch 1-3 and do the service (catch 1-3 and do the service)
Get the the fuck from 'round me if you nervous

[Outro]
Niggas done changed, goddamn
Now I'm gettin' all this change, goddamn
Done changed, goddamn
Done changed, goddamn
Fuck from 'round me if you nervous
Coke Boyz, baby
