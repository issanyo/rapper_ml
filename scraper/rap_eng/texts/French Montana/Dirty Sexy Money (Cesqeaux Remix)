[Verse 1: Charli XCX]
Woah, woooh
I want you bad, want you bad, want you bad
Saw you in the moonlight
Think you lookin' fine, want you bad
Got me good, never turn back (oooh)
I make you mine, make you mine, make you mine
Coming for the taking, promise you are wearing the crown
Number one, spin your head around

[Pre-Chorus: Charli XCX]
Woooh, tell me what you want and I can do it to you
I'm a million dollars, make your wishes come true
Calling out you're, calling out, calling out you're
Never seen a girl like this before

[Chorus: Charli XCX]
If you wanna pu-pu-pu-pu-put it on me
You're not gonna ge-ge-ge-ge-get it for free
Come on spend that dirty sexy money on me, on me, on me
You got to pull up, pull up, pull up, pull up
I want you bad, want you bad

[Post-Chorus: Charli XCX]
Make you mine, make, you mine, make you mine
Make you mine, make, you mine, make you mine
Make you mine, make, you mine, make you mine
Coming for the taking, promise you are wearing the crown

[Verse 2: French Monatana]
I want you Michael Jackson bad
Let me make up for all the lonely nights you had
Shorty from the hood, but body, so exotic
Baby show your curves, you ain't gotta hide it
Clap, clap, clap, clap
Go on move your body
Clap, clap, clap, clap
Baby move your body
Clap, clap, clap, clap
You ain't gotta fight it
Clap, clap, clap, clap
What you need, I got it

[Chorus: Charli XCX]
If you wanna pu-pu-pu-pu-put it on me (Montana)
You're not gonna ge-ge-ge-ge-get it for free
Come on spend that dirty sexy money on me, on me, on me
Pull up, pull up, pull up, pull up

[Post-Chorus: Charli XCX]
Make you mine, make, you mine, make you mine
Make you mine, make, you mine, make you mine
Make you mine, make, you mine, make you mine
Coming for the taking, promise you are wearing the crown

[Bridge: Charli XCX]
Number one, spin your head around
Woah, oooh

[Outro: Charli XCX]
If you wanna pu-pu-pu-pu-put it on me
On me, on me, on me, on me
Come on spend that dirty sexy money on me, on me, on me
You got to pull up, pull up, pull up, pull up
