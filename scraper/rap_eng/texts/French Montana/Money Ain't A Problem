La musica de Harry Fraud

[Hook: Puff Daddy](French Montana)
Bitch, money ain’t a problem
(Haan), bitch, money ain’t a problem
(Haan), money ain’t a problem
(Haan), bitch, money ain’t a problem
(I got cash if you a bad bitch, fuck with me baby, baby
Got a bad bitch in the backseat and she ride with me
220 on the dash, but she drivin’ me crazy, crazy
Bitch, you know you gon’ ride to the top if you ride with me)
Bitch, money ain’t a problem
(Haan), bitch, money ain’t a problem
(Haan), money ain’t a problem
(Haan), bitch, money ain’t a problem

[Verse 1: French Montana]
Shawty, bust it open, bend it over, how ya feel?
First they hit me up and then I got up, made a mill
And my dogs don’t swap it if that package ain’t sealed
I ain’t talkin’ 'bout dem Beats, but my dog slangin’ pills
The Pepsi and the Cola, the crocs and the cobra
Artist and promoter, pull the Phantom and the boat up
Like haan

[Verse 2: Puff Daddy]
Mr. Chow’s when we chow down
Bumping Big on the G5 Soundcloud
Lookie here, baby, lookie here
Money over everything, that’s just how it is
Champagne everything, caviar tears
Don’t be 'fraid of this money, baby, that’s just how it is

[Hook: Puff Daddy](French Montana)
Bitch, money ain’t a problem
(Haan), bitch, money ain’t a problem
(Haan), money ain’t a problem
(Haan), bitch, money ain’t a problem
(I got cash if you a bad bitch, fuck with me baby, baby
Got a bad bitch in the backseat and she ride with me
220 on the dash, but she drivin’ me crazy, crazy
Bitch, you know you gon’ ride to the top if you ride with me)
Bitch, money ain’t a problem
(Haan), bitch, money ain’t a problem
(Haan), money ain’t a problem
(Haan), bitch, money ain’t a problem

[Verse 2: French Montana](Puff Daddy)
Pulled up in that drop with no top, she got amp
Took her to the spot, I got bop, we got bent
Started from the block with no guap, now got M’s
When it’s time to cop, he got 5, I got 10
(Court side, got the mink draggin' in the paint
Like taking long walks laughing to the bank
Catch me on broadway ridin' in the tank)
With the top down, baby
(Can't stop now, baby)
I said my name Montana
500 at the light , coupe black and white like old channels
(Catch me at the back blocks, I be creepin'
Call your friends, we could do this every weekend
And tell me how you feel
Drop it on your head, break a hundred dollar bill
Big B’s on the wheel

[Hook: Puff Daddy](French Montana)
Bitch, money ain’t a problem
(Haan), bitch, money ain’t a problem
(Haan), money ain’t a problem
(Haan), bitch, money ain’t a problem
(I got cash if you a bad bitch, fuck with me baby, baby
Got a bad bitch in the backseat and she ride with me
220 on the dash, but she drivin’ me crazy, crazy
Bitch, you know you gon’ ride to the top if you ride with me)
Bitch, money ain’t a problem
(Haan), bitch, money ain’t a problem
(Haan), money ain’t a problem
(Haan), bitch, money ain’t a problem
