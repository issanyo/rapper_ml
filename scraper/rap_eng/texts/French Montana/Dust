[Intro: French Montana]
Look
You know what it is

[Verse 1: French Montana]
Four wheeler, jet skis, Puerto Rican waters
Cash for foreigns
Call me Aston Martin Lawrence
Florence the Machine, hunnid round machine of Florence
In the hood robbin', Robin Hood feed the homeless
Don't seek in them seekin' homies
Jay, Wes, and Otis
Rip top on my wrist and Lotus
Hurricane Chris left hook, Westbrook
Diamond chains have you lookin' like Sticky Fingaz
I be wrist with the technique
My V103 like bread street
That's straight cash, me and Belly with a hunnid Arabs
40 sound like a plane crash

[Chorus: Belly]
I can't get away
Money keep on falling (falling)
Every time I try to leave it alone
I swear it keep on calling (calling)
I can't get away
Keep on falling (falling)
Every time I try to leave it alone
I swear it keep on calling (calling)

[Verse 2: Belly]
I've been reala
My pen illa' (aye)
You softer than Ben Stiller and a chinchilla (yeah)
Sim Simma, Sim Simma, who got the keys to my beamer
The Alpine (aye)
Fuck the clout we define the culture
So they keep us in the vault just to sign the vultures  (yeah)
Designer holsters, Ferragamo loafers
Over time, still balling thought my time was over (look)
Look, up north, I'm the soya and the duck sauce  (woo)
Tryna shake the paranoia from the drugs off (yeah)
No love lost, but you know that kinda love costs
You made me go and get my heart and knock the dust off
Dust, dust off
Dust, dust off
Shoulders, dust off
Shake the motherfucking dust off

[Chorus: Belly]
I can't get away
Money keep on falling (falling)
Every time I try to leave it alone, I swear it keep on calling (calling)
I can't get away
Keep on falling (falling)
Every time I try to leave it alone, I swear it keep on calling (calling)

[Outro: Belly]
Keep on calling, keep on calling
Keep on calling, keep on calling (calling)
Keep on calling, keep on calling
Keep on calling, keep on calling (calling)
Dust, dust, dust, dust off
Dust, dust, dust, dust off
Keep on calling (dust off)
Keep on calling
Keep on calling (dust off)
Shake the motha' fuckin' dust off
The heal of the god
