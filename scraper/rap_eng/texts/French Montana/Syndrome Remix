Real niggas see me when they standing in the mirror
Live niggas know they in the presence of a dealer
Smelling like drug money, playing with them strippers
Never seen death til you staring at a killer (killer)
One night, two or three clubs
One room, two or three broads
One life, live hard

Only one movement but they screaming ain't loud enough
Real niggas everywhere gone ride with us
