Cokeboy Baby
And I had a dream
About my old school
And she was there all pink and gold and glittery
I threw my arms around her legs
(This The Intro)
Came to me, came to me
Welcome in your dream
Broke nigga dream, turn a rich nigga nightmare
Chinx, Montana, Cheez, flip, Dream Team
Haaaaannnnn Montana!
There they go
Can’t fuck with us man

[Hook]
We the hottest in the game, how I feel
You ain’t fuckin with my team’s how I feel
You tell your bitch I call her when I feel
Kill you fuck niggas anytime time I feel like it
Living for the night
And I don’t give a fuck if it’s only for the night, dog
Feelin’ it About the time to go in
Nigga this that dope boy anthem
Dog, feeling it, about the time to go in
Montana!

[Verse 1]
Start to do or die, now the doors suicide
Blogs get you crucified, niggas choosing sides
Climbing up the ladder with a blatter full of drank
Work in the attic, mathematics fuck the bank
Can’t die with it, all this money I’mma blow
I’mma stack it to the ceiling that Ferrari sittin low
Big mama drama, hundred missed calls
Niggas talking about their drama, I wake up in the morn nigga
Everybody whining, can I live?
Give a fuck about your mom’s how I feel
When you ballin everybody want a part nigga
But even your shadow gon leave you when it’s dark nigga
Can’t beat it, I’m what the game needed
Told my nigga boss Don gon take it to trial, beat it
Nothing to lose, tattoos around my gun wound
Gonna point the best out and we gon through em
And they gon get it how it’s coming to em
His own mama won’t recognize him, what is done to him
Back against the wind, just me against the world baby
Baby numb, full of drugs, help my nerves baby
Montana Mike when it’s crunch time
I done seen death twice, ducking 1 time
PJ’s to the PJ
Can’t fuck with us man
You niggas washed up
Niggas don’t wanna wake up and look like him
Donkey

[Hook]
We the hottest in the game, how I feel
You ain’t fuckin with my team’s how I feel
You tell your bitch I call her when I feel
Kill you fuck niggas anytime time I feel like it
Living for the night
And I don’t give a fuck if it’s only for the night, dog
Feelin’ it About the time to go in
Nigga this that dope boy anthem
Dog, feeling it, about the time to go in
Montana!

Only if for a night, only if for a night

Montana!
