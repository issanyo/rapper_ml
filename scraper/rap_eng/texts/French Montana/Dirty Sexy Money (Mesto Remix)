[Verse 1: Charli XCX]
Woah, woooh
I want you bad, want you bad, want you bad
Saw you in the moonlight
Think you lookin' fine, want you bad
Got me good, never turn back (oooh)
I make you mine, make you mine, make you mine
Coming for the taking, promise you are wearing the crown
Number one, spin your head around

[Pre-Chorus: Charli XCX]
Woooh, tell me what you want and I can do it to you
I'm a million dollars, make your wishes come true
Calling out you're, calling out, calling out you're
Never seen a girl like this before, fore

[Chorus: Charli XCX]
If you wanna...
Never seen a girl like this before
If you wanna...

If you wanna pu-pu-pu-pu-put it on me
You're not gonna ge-ge-ge-ge-get it for free
Come on spend that dirty sexy money on me, on me, on me
You got to pull up, pull up, pull up, pull up

[Verse 2: Charli XCX]
Put your skin on my skin, on my skin
Love it when we touchin', love it when we fuckin', my love
Make you high in a heartbeat, yeah

[Pre-Chorus: Charli XCX]
Woooh, tell me what you want and I can do it to you

[Chorus: Charli XCX]
If you wanna pu-pu-pu-pu-put it on me
