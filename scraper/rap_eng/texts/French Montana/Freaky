I'ma hit it like a dog
Then I'ma pass it to my dog
I ain't going anywhere
She wanna take me to the mall
Go and bust it open with your freaky ass
Go and bust it open with your freaky ass
On the back blocks, where the swirly at
Me and Puff ridin' where they shot Biggie at
Smoking on the weed, poppin' pills
From the corners, makin' mills
Gettin' top in the foreign
Gettin' dome like New Orleans
I know this freak, from Hollywood
She suck on dick and she do it real good
I know this freak, from Hollywood
She suck on dick and she do it real good
Bottles of Rose, triple stack, drink go up
My youngins don't rap man they takin' over
5000 for the pint, 250 for the lean
