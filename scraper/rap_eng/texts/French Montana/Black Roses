Black black roses, in my garden
Black black roses, in my garden
To keep and carry you got to water it
To keep and carry you got to water it
Yeah, yeah
Million dollar glow, million dollar plan
Million dollar swag, million dollar man
Grind hard till a couple million in my hand
Made a millie then I did the million dollar dance
Ah, how you love that? Money over honey, family above that
And I got it cheap, I could beat the price
Good green, good white, whatever you like, yeah
Welcome to the new year
I’m high sitting on the moon, feel the move here
Keep my shoes off, time to renovate
Kill them all, watch the c4 detonate
Lighting up till I’m floating on a cloud
Drop a bomb on them bitches take a bow
You’re new addition to that street fam envelope
We talking get money I’m on a …
Black black roses, in my garden
Black black roses, in my garden
To keep and carry you got to water it
To keep and carry you got to water it
Ey, Montana mac cheese what the streets call me
Do my math, 80 straps in the 40-40
Whip with the brain fraction, never slang backwards
My whole lane crafted, your whole team plastic
You heard up, it’s no money clean
Me work Montana got the Charlie Sheen
Past to 5, me and Red like Carmelo n' Stoudemire
All yellow …
20 o’s … I’m talking shake down coke boys…
Everything fire bitch talking …smoke
Fuck niggers dry the hotel soap
I’ve been travelling all over this world
And too keep on carrying you got to water it
Black black roses, in my garden
Black black roses, in my garden
To keep and carry you got to water it
To keep and carry you got to water it
Yeah, dipping through the hood, hoes stripping
We get in the kitchen with the stuff got hoes flipping
Do a little rapping, but I’m known for the dope dealing
Known to pull a … in front of the club with no ceiling
You can have it how you want it at the cafe
I brink the top models through to your cabaret
Loyalty first, honesty first
Take a flight to Hawaii see how we surf
Watch so … diamonds and options
All these hoes I’m cutting like Marc Ronson
In my back yard, black roses
Papa said keep your worst enemy the closest
Time is money, chump, so don’t always smile
Or you will have to meet the smithy on my waist line
I holler shake down the streets holler back
Fuck twitter, I’m the leader, so they follow that
Black black roses, in my garden
Black black roses, in my garden
To keep and carry you got to water it
To keep and carry you got to water it
