[Hook]
I'm higher than a motherfucking cloud right now
I'm heavy on my high horse, I need to come down
I'm like a freezer with a pocket full of green
And I steal these hoes' attention every time I hit the scene
And they be like
Wow (X2)
I keep these haters hollerin' out
Wow (X2)
I hit the club and they be like
Wow (X2)
They see the whip and eyes be like
Wow (X2)

[Verse 1- Waka Flocka Flame]
Squad!
She like, "boy, ya'll so flexed up."
Broke niggas that way, get yo check up
Uh, step your neck up
Put yo cups up
Bottles up, hands up
Hey, if you fucked up
How the fuck he do it?
Single after single
Girls, they do wild thingz when I throw these singles
Smokin' out the pound, in the club like it's legal
Rollin' up two mollie's
Up all night, top flight

[Verse 2- Twista]
Ain't nobody out here got the position of me
So not even nobody too philosophical I'm legendary and even one of the elites
Every time you see me I'm blowing on the tropical
I'm very scary when you be hearing me on the beat
Head in the clouds and my swag in the air
Big cheese what they call 6g's they cold bring 'em here
Let me try out a pair
Bitches in here be attached like all these broads got rings on em
But I'm so high up my adidas got wings on em
Show me the kush and we gon hit it
Make em say Wow, like we Wow with it
Put us two together like both of our names and all we do is win
Tebow, get it?

[Hook]

[Verse 3- Bo Deal]
I done came up, I told you I done came up
Toast to all my haters
Roll that purple, nigga, flame up
Got the city popping now the people know my name
Big Boss, Bo Deal, ain't n'er nigga I can't touch
My watch like whoo!
Chain cold like a freezer
My ears got the flu!
Wrist portraits like a diva
We popping bottles, blowing dough
We got it, no we ain't going broke
I'm riding high while they sipping low
These niggas sleep like they blowing dough
Better know a nigga fly without a parachute
My buzz growing, got the people talking like a pair of do
I'm eating good cruising on the track getting sea-sick
You know I had to bring some heavy hitters on the remix

[Hook]

[Verse 4- French Montana]
30 chains on, looking like a turtleneck
They like "wow", I be higher than a tower
I be dipping in the motherfucking Benz-o
Talking 'bout that money, that's a motherfucking insult
Me and Bo Deal drinking Blue Don like it's water
Tripping off pills, think I smoked her by the car
You know a nigga low, on the go
Gotta mob on them niggas that be like "whoa"
Black rob on you niggas, black mob on you

[Verse 5- Trae Tha Truth]
I'm somewhere where these playaz hit
Tell 'em I'm on that same shit
Diamond life got my chain sick
10 degrees below where the chain sits
So many niggas on my dick it's like a product
King of the streets, stoned up
Everybody want a truce so I owned up
HOLD IT! wait like a nigga who done blown up
It's k on the back of these blood diamonds
Paint on the whip say "flood timing"
These bright white lights got a thug blinder
Yeah, bitch, I made this thug shine
As always, only way I roll
Fuck a hater, only thing they get told
Heated up, but this wrist so cold
Gonna beat up the block till the block gets swole
