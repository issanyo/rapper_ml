[Intro]
You did what you had to do, right?
You did what you had to do. That's right

[Chorus] x2
Hey yo, mic check, come through
Hit you with the 1, 2, all I do is on you, warrior Sun Tzu

Blow up like a balloon with a granade in it (3x)
Piece Of the blood, piece of a quick gangz
The Guards at earth, knows you skip banes
Presidential sour, my favorite
Grow skinny blunts cooking, more save it
Kobe mailman, drink...your liver
Drink all night... My liver
And when I make em have it dope... Shiver

[Chorus] x2
Hey yo, mic check, come through
Hit you with the 1, 2, all I do is on you, warrior Sun Tzu

[Verse 2]
Yeah they say my heart is cold like refrigerator
I feel sorry like a baby in Incabattor
They burry me alive but I dug out
The folks are scared, they know I dugged out
Some chicks think forward of you
And most can't afford them, how bout you
I'm biveratual , bicoastal, love facial
Once I scrap you, I might just replace you

[Chorus] x2
Hey yo, mic check, come through
Hit you with the 1, 2, all I do is on you, warrior Sun Tzu

[Verse 3]
Mic check, come through, hit you with the 1,2 brake down too we all know kung fu
It's the game getting money, get brain, I be dancing in the rain like this this, hot in my city
Talk about the hole, in the cold, in the school graduates Montana was cold wipe dirt off my clothes
Straight out slum means walk around with a bottle getting drunk

[Chorus] x2
Hey yo, mic check, come through
Hit you with the 1, 2, all I do is on you, warrior Sun Tzu

[Verse 4]
Hey yo, check mic 2,1, check night new ones, yanks it blue ones
Smoke great true dumb duress
Ortiz is what they call me
Shorty said "I can't believe you ride a hosy"
WHAT!?
Baby Girl I'm so gonna gonna make the puerto rican girl come not a butter
All the wolves beat when I come to it sounds something like ahh, ohh

[Chorus] x2
Hey yo, mic check, come through
Hit you with the 1, 2, all I do is on you, warrior Sun Tzu
