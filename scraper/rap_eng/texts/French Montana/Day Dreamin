[Hook]
Day dreaming out the loft
Coke prices in my head
Niggas scheming on the mob, shoot 'em dead
Niggas coming for me, niggas got nothing on me
All my niggas go hard
Coke boys go hard
Montana, nigga, go hard
Go hard, go hard

[Verse 1]
Bentley coupe, I ride up front
Vision like a hawk and niggas talking, we ain't gotta front
Gotta stunt
Do it for my doggy bitches on me, let 'em gobble then
Put 'em on the mic, in couple hours, she's a album then
Follow me, money tall, all my niggas ride with me
Knock up on 'em, any minute, nigga
Keep ya eye on me, fly on me
Couple pills and liquor got me thinking I could stop a plane
I'm a dog, balls on her head like a soccer game
Dog it on the kitchen floor
She cooked the word, pigeon-toe
Used to do it free, now I'm six a show
Bitches know, no I never cuff 'em, bitch front
Fucking no, I got plenty more
Welcome to the Frenchy show, Montana

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Money, drugs, bitches be a part of life
It's sort of like all the real niggas had the same thought of life
Harlem nights, flat screen, call ya wife
No, I never spoil 'em, never dog 'em on a sober night
Getting me in the mood when that dope is right
All my niggas do it for the love and they fall in love overnight
Montana, cold as ice
I could match you, call the price
Ask about the game, they'll tell you I brung it back like a quarter of white
Casino lights, two chains, Beemer lights
Coupe, no top, all-red like mosquito bites
But I'm a four-door, never coupe, niggas
Sip syrup like a Houston nigga
I be the future, nigga

[Hook]
