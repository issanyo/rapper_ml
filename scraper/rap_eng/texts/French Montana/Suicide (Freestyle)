[Intro]
Suicide, suicide
Suicide, suicide
Suicide, suicide
Oh, suicide, suicide
Suicide, suicide
Suicide..

[Verse]
Sometimes I look at my son, then I picture my father
When he look at his son that understood his story
I can stand on the strip, flip ten millions zip
Or I can party with Puff, and make a ten million flip
I've been a boss and you know it, make a million I blow it
I had a dream in a cell, in July with Snow White
When they caught me a bird, Mama prayed for my blessings
Niggas fuck with my nerves, talking fast with them questions
First pray was the ball, worst fear was diverting
Felt that million deserved, but the block was deserted
I'm talking five hundreds murders, about a hundred I knew
I'm talking five hundreds cases, about four hundred that blew
XXX, but you've been XXX
I mean you bought out bar and got no money for lawyers
That's suicide

[Outro]
Suicide, suicide
Oh, suicide
Suicide
Oh, suicide
Suicide
Oh, suicide
Suicide
