[Hook: Arizone Slim]
Fittin the roll on M, trap bolls on m
Catch m after the club, and put the 4 on m
Who's poppin, we poppin
We can get it on anywhere
Fittin the roll on M, trap bolls on m
Catch m after the club, and put the 4 on m
Who's poppin, we poppin
We can get it on anywhere

[Verse 1: French Montana]
We don't play no games, if you don't know the name
Bitch, you better read the chain, Cocaine City
Let it pop, and tell them niggas "lay down"
Cocaine City
Fresh out the motherlands, spent a couple hundred grand
Rappin, butter tan, I'm back like Dapper Dan
Homie, I've been switching flows, on the block pushin Os
For the gwop, to the top, just to cop different clothes
Homie, we run the show, you can open up the curtains
I see you dudes hurtin, I'm back with the flow
Mad a list of scrap, French is back, better stack
It's a fact, this a nack
Homie, that'd get you clapped
Now I'm in the Lack, laying back, all in black
Gun to clap
Yeah, I have them running like random sack
Man, they know the team, X out the ?
Westside, New Orlands, driver we bring the driver?

Fittin the roll on M, trap bolls on m

Fittin the roll on M, trap bolls on m
Catch m after the club, and put the 4 on m
Who's poppin, we poppin
We can get it on anywhere

[Verse 2: French Montana]
Homie let me run it down, we run the underground
You know shit is up and down
? wife her so, French deal right for snow
Tryna flip twice the doe
Tryna cop a range, matching chain
Ice and gold, non stop drop top, rhyme hot, town lock, 3 toys, flip roid, fuck for a ?
You know we roll on m, we put the 4s on m
Catch them slippin out the club, and send some hoes on m
Watch him sittin ?
See where he live and hide
Caught m like Trick Daddy, he was tryna slip and slide
This how the Gs ride, westside to the eastside
Let shots, let it pop, have m like knee high
We don't play no games, if you don't know the name
Bitch, you better read the chain, Cocaine City
Let it pop, and tell them niggas "lay down"
Cocaine City
