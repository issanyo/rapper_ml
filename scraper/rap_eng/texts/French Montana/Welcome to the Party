[Intro: French Montana & Lil Pump]
Haaan
We on fire
Step up in the party, step up in the party, ha (Haaan)
We on fire
Ride up to the party, ride up to the party, ha (Haaan)
Ay, live it up

[Chorus: French Montana]
Ayy, welcome to the party
Ayy, welcome to the party
Ayy, welcome to the party
Ayy, welcome to the party

[Verse 1: French Montana]
Hit 'em up (haaan), get 'em up (haaan)
Put 'em up (haaan), we wakin' up (haaan)
Fly with my dogs, ridin' high when we pull up (haaan)
Fly with my dogs, ridin' high when we pull up (haaan)
When we ride, when we pull up (haaan)
We be high when we pull up (haaan)
Coupe with the top down, no ceilings
Rocks on the watch now, armageddon
Roof on fire, fire, we ride wild
Pull up in a tank, 'bout it, 'bout it (haaan)
Yeah, on Ciroc, in the drop, full of beans
Yeah, we the squad, 100 cars full of tings
Yeah, I pull up with fire, boy, the chinchilla
Yeah, it's Frenchy Montana, Thrilla in Manila
Roof on fire, we be higher like a wheelie
Shawty bad, talkin' MJ "Thriller"
Welcome to the party, sippin' on the Act
Pull up in a 'Rari, DJ bring it back
Fell in love with shawty, money like Shaq
Welcome to the party (live it up)

[Chorus: French Montana & Zhavia Ward]
Ayy, welcome to the party
Ayy, welcome to the party
Ayy, welcome to the party
Ayy, welcome to the party

[Bridge: Zhavia Ward & Lil Pump]
Burn up, let it burn
Burn up, let it burn
Burn up, let it burn (Lil Pump, ouu)
I'ma let it burn (ouu, ouu, ouu)
Burn up, let it burn (Esskeetit)

[Verse 2: Lil Pump]
I can't feel my body 'cause I pop a lot of molly (molly)
Welcome to the party, bitch, I'm 'bout to catch a body (ouu)
Punch him in his shit, we don't give a fuck about it (ouu)
Bitch, I start a riot, bitch, I'm 'bout to start a riot (yuh)
Welcome to the trap (ouu), got my grandma selling crack (yuh)
I make what you make in one year sitting down just movin' packs (damn)
Make a bitch do jumpin' jacks (ouu), like she was a acrobat (yuh)
Got these bitches lookin' at me crazy 'cause I got face tats (ouu)
Ouu, drip, drip, drip, I cannot go wife a bitch (no!)
Drop 5 million on my crib, now Lil Pump is rich as shit, ouu
And I'm still on my probation, pop a pill, I feel amazing (brrt)
You just broke and you just hatin', all these diamonds on me skatin'
Man, I do this every day, spend three thousand on some shades
I got bitches in L.A., your boyfriend broke, his diamonds fake (yuh)

[Chorus: French Montana & Zhavia Ward]
Ayy, welcome to the party
Ayy, welcome to the party
Ayy, welcome to the party
Ayy, welcome to the party
Ayy, welcome to the party
Ayy, welcome to the party
Ayy, welcome to the party
Ayy, welcome to the party

[Outro: French Montana]
We on fire
Step up in the party, step up in the party, haan
