[Bridge: Zack Kharbouch]
Last of the real ones right now
Get somethin' in me right now
Last of the real ones right now
The deaths of a real nigga right now
Got bitches into me right now
My young nigga doin' you right now
I know they listenin' right now
Last of the real one right now

[French Montanas Intro verse 1]
Still feel it when you get it from the bottom
Want it then i got'em
Got'em where I want'em
Man I was gone off
Cars that was foreign
All the bad bitches callin all the time
Baby look ahead
Man we drinking brown and clear
We dont care
We gone for the night
Right now
And ima always
Keep the doors in the air
When we pull up niggas stare
Blow smoke in the air, where the bad bitches at
Gone for the night (x3)
And ima always...
And ima always be in love with you
And ima always praise another you
And ima always Balmain
Ball crazy
?


[Verse 2 French Montana]
Montana ayy
Came in with mills left out with more
Came in with packs left of the ?
Came in with hoopties left out with horse
Came in with max made mills with Ross
We the last of the real
We just happen to still
Front to the wind and my back to the field
Doors up riding with a shooter
Still put a grammy winner in a uber
Say a prayer then its straight to the money
Watch me double up on them niggas that was frontin
You know its going down when the doors in the air
Baby fuck your feelings_ blow me offffff

[Verse 3: Zack Kharbouch]
Lost it all when i lost chinx
You niggas frauds and ya dont hate
I trade it all to see my dog win
Out the bottom and we gon' ?
The always hating on the wrong one
The night early but i'm on one
A close one seems to run on
If he ain't loyal thats the wrong home
I got dollars and they all on me
I went broke nigga all lonely
That nigga should of and one
I been fuckin around since day one
Day 1 {X2}
