Uhhh Huuuuhh
Uhhh Huuuhhh
Uhhhh Huuhhh
Ey ey ey ey

Fuck killers
Broke breads with brick dealers
.45s turn animals to chinchillas
From the South Bronx, came right up
Took the wrong pill last night, f'd my night up
Uh, underrated is a understatement
I got old money, probably in your mother basement
Stash box
HKs, SKs, AKs, MACs, no laptops
From the street to the rap, ain't nothing different
Baggin' up, watching Locked Down, San Quentin
Mind racing, money be my destination driver
Selling snort, heli-port, hella choppers
You hear the beep then you see the light
Got some homeys in the bing might never see the light
Pitbull no lights, mask on, long nose homey with the clip full
I been making power moves
Back when Amber Rose was shaking her ass in Sue's
Back when Mace brung Brandy to the block
Just couple days I had Mya on the block
Nothing changed but the players in the game
The rules and the suckers
The nerds and the cuffers
Kyle Watson, born undercover
Tom Shepard, I'm all in your mother
Talkin' New York fool, serving the dog food on CDs
And I don't talk to PD
I'm posted on the block still
Shout out my homey Diddy for the Ciroc deal
I ain't signed yet, made it to the Billboard
Man this the kind of shit niggas kill for
5 stacks to my favorite dancer
Stunt my ass off, shorty like "lift your pants up"
Money longer than the flight to Taiwan
Got your bitch going down like my timeline
Phonian
Fifty thou Rolly and
.50 Cal for you and
Bleach chair
Be clear
We the mob, took chips, need a few rings
Car 500 horses, it grow wings
I be born like the metal land
100 round drum sound like a metal band
Cold Play, U2
You now rocking with the leaders of the new school
100 racks, homey getting paper cuts
Coke Boys leave you leaning like a paper cup
