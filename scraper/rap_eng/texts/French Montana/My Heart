[Verse 1: Wiley]
I’m spinning new way call my A game
Revising ’cause I wanna get straight A’s
Getting busy now alot of time’s taken
See I might hit blatant the news is broken
She knows there’s women I’m chasing
The show is attention if you make it
You getting on amends if you make it
She told me she fed out but she can’t take it

[Hook: Emeli Sandé]
My heart, my heart, my heart, my heart
My heart, my heart, my heart can’t play it
My heart, my heart, my heart, my heart
My heart, my heart is exhausted, it’s exhausted, it’s exhausted
And heart, my heart, my heart, my heart
My heart, my heart is exhausted, it’s exhausted

[Verse 2: Wiley]
She knows when I get around she never deals
She knows when I been into another world
I can’t lie I’ve been at my other girls
And then gal in my heart give me another 12
Chasing more and if I had I lose her
The main one, she tall I juice her
I’m growing mad, made the girl sad ye
Other than that ain’t in the back ye

[Hook]

[Verse 3: French Montana]
Our money grow spend it
I’m trying to touch that ceiling
Poppin bottles, caught a million
Foreign car drop the ceiling
Get that type now call my dog
I ain’t trying to shop drive by that store
French Montana, cool boy talk
Dope boy not , dope boy walk
Want you baby fuck that ho
Want you now can’t take none for
Wanna break bread, that shit hard

[Hook]
