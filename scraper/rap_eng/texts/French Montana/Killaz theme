Whispered in the air
Said she got a thing for a nigga on the low
I do my thing, but fresh, I’m not a hoe
Got pills in the tank, Chinx about to roll up
Money in the bank, cash never fold up
When a white goes roll up
Make the fuck niggas throw up

Uh, take you money, never bother me
But a lick to a murder from a robbery
Graduated from the street, round back diploma
Feds on the block, see death around the corner
Hold it down like a bucket full of crabs
Swag on Kodak, you know I’m gonna flash
Keep it to a hundred like the needle on my dash
Two hoes on my eyes at looking through the nass
Caught up with the trunk all in the hood
Your bitch call aside all on the wood
I’m lookin’ for ménage like Lil Kim
You know them Cokeboy niggas goin’ in

Whispered in the air
Said she got a thing for a nigga on the low

Got pills in the tank, Chinx about to roll up
Money in the bank, cash never fold up
When a white goes roll up
Make the fuck niggas throw up

Ah, a nigga drunk but I’m rollin’
Still movin’ like a big ol’ pimp though
Got your main lady all in that bizz oh
Yea she threw it at you but I caught that info
Fo sho man, I talk about the money all the time
Nigga, you’re funny, put your money on the line
See I’m sittin’ in that new one
Try to fuck a model nigga, just ran through one
Cokeboy’s got the city under siege, new itty on the bag
Full act up, getting’ fifty of them straps
Nigga bring it where you stay at
Do it to them niggas, drop a ball where you lay at
Yea, my money took a boost, nigga bossed up
The dope stepped on so I squashed up
Get your balls cut, castrated, Porsche 911 drag racin’
Fuck nigga stagnate
