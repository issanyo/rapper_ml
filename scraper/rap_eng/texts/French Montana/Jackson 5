[Intro: Max B & French Montana]
You ready?

My nigga steak sauce, french, Mac 'N Cheese
The appetizers
Smack them niggas in the head with that dessert
Motherfucking entr√©es man
I love what you doing nigga, keep up the good work
I had to go back to Charlie Rambo on these niggas in here them
These dudes, niggas losing their mind in this joint man
Tryna get back
Feel me? We got days, we got unfinished business
We got days to do my nigga but
You know, I'm only fucking with you calling for this good energy nigga
Keep up that good work, I love what you doing out there
Stay on your grind
Rape these niggas for what their worth
I tell you before we start, get all we can get started drain these niggas
Squeeze, squeeze that blood out their neck
Holla at ya boy nigga

Love you boy, Owww!

My nigga

[Sample: Jackson 5 + French Montana]
I treated you bad and wrong my dear

And girl since, since you went away
Uh!
Don't you know I sit around with my head hanging down
Yea, Montana!

[Hook: Belly]
I'm getting high, riding low
Night and day
I'm getting high, riding low
Night and day
One time, one time, one time
One time, one time

[Verse: French Montana]
Young Jeezy, nothing realer
I got Vs I could sell a dealer
I can't sleep my nerve is shot
Blowing smoke, seen the beam
Then I heard the shot
I can flip peas whip the pot
Or I can get on my knees and make salah
I'm talking mac n' cheese nigga
Skrrt and pot, skrr, skrr, skrrr
The birds flock
The Falcons nigga, Atlanta nigga
Half my homies went gone I bought a Phantom nigga
Ghost, dunking in the post, money bitches, one motion
L.A. ad, dab notion, haaan
Made mills, move to Californ'
My niggas killed it, then build a house on it
I seen 'em come, seen 'em fold nigga
Look out my neck, catch ebola nigga

[Sample: Jackson 5]
When I had you, I treated you bad and wrong my dear
And girl since, since you went away
Don't you know I sit around with my head hanging down
