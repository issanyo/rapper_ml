[Intro: French Montana]
Montana!
Mike Rebel
You know what it is when you hear that (Haaan)

[Hook: Mike Rebel]
Magnum Cum Laude
Eight bullets in the shottie
Family out in Cali
Tryna move a water sili
(AK-47) Beat the children with a nanny
Ya I could spit the revolution
It's that have you twerkin' to it

[Verse 1: Mike Rebel]
Afternoon party, Cool & Dre was on the music
I'm a smart nigga, but my choppa actin' stupid
Drama made me do it, please don't make me do it
Bangin' on them tapes with fascist faces on their music
Come on, Magnum Cum Laude
And I be where ever since I got that bracelet off me
I be in the desert not Dubai, Abu Dhabi
[?] with them Berbers screamin' "Long Live Gaddafi"
With a cup of Turkish coffee
How you doin', uncle? Need to drop the slave talk
We didn't chose the long road, show you how the kings walks
It's a queen thing, mama take them jeans off
Love you with that dress on, mama fuck them press [?]
Fiends was comin' after me like I wanna rock, I want a block
When I say, I'm on the clock, I want a block
Watchin' that vibe when a nigga roll by (Stop..stop..stop...)
U-turn nigga, who turn, got a new burner
Put it in the street like
Who them niggas, man, nobody know that car
Over here that's deep
By left but I ain't there for, I'm gone but I don't stay gone
My hood is like the radio, man, everyday the same song
Everyday the same song
(My hood is like the radio, man, everyday the same song)

[Hook: Mike Rebel]
Magnum Cum Laude
Eight bullets in the shottie
Family out in Cali
Tryna move a water sili
(AK-47) Beat the children with a nanny
Ya I can spit the revolution
It's that have you twerkin' to it
Magnum Cum / Magnum Cum
Magnum Cum (Laudie...you know what)
Magnum Cum / Magnum Cum
Magnum Cum
Magnum Cum / Magnum Cum
Magnum Cum (Laudie)

[Verse: French Montana]
Montana!
Televise the revolution
Hundred Muslims
Big band, Rick Rubin
Castro, hundred Cubans
Talkin' Raekwon, Cuban Linx
Hop out the Wraith to the Ghostface
Eagle on my arm
I perform like '96 Michael
Virginia sniper with a rife
Jay Z, I'm on my Tidal
Heroes turn to rivals
White tee with their face on
My hood like the radio, everyday the same song
Left shooter Mysonne
Glow with no ice on
Watch face flawless
VVS bezel python
Don like Cartagena
Neck froze like Aquafina
Hall of fame but, hit it in the heart like Regina
Catch no body, snatch his whole body
Illest shit you ever seen, talkin' Mecca and Medina
Gettin' love from everybody
In the hooptie or the gotti
Realest shit you ever seen
Coke Boy team, Montana!

Magnum Cum / Magnum Cum
Magnum Cum (Laudie...laudie)
Magnum Cum / Magnum Cum
