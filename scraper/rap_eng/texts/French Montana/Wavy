[Hook: Waka Flocka Flame & French Montana]
I'm Drinking round after round
Make it rain in the club don't drown
Baby what you trying to drink, white or brown?
Tonight I'm trying to see you in a night gown
So what it do girl
I'm drinking round after round
Make it rain in the club don't drown
Baby what you trying to drink, white or brown?
Tonight I'm trying to see you in the night gown
So what it do girl

[Verse 1: Waka Flocka Flame]
I'm too turned up goodness gracious
Bitches in every state
I call it placements
Louies with no laces
I love it when my girlfriend speak a different language
All kinds of fucking faces
Got a nigga balling
In the club going hard bottle popping
Nigga catch the wave I'm in [?] leaning to the right
Thirty niggas behind me got em feeling alright
25 years old fuck a fight
Never gave a bitch money just good pipe
I'll be going at the hood but he not my blood type
Drinking Remy White

[Hook]

[Verse 2: French Montana]
I'm talking bout the money and the cars that you drive and all the diamonds on ya neck
And all the bitches you be slidin'
Where it's at, where it's at, where it's at
Where it's at, where it's at, where it's at
I'm talk round after round, bottle after bottle
Pound after pound, model after model
Hunnit niggas deep in the club plus I'm on one
All the bases loaded bitch Home Run fuck you, pay me Simple
Me and Flockaveli get them choppas out the window
Three days 8C I'm talking 30K
Canaries on the AP 30k
Purple in the air henny straight

[Hook]
