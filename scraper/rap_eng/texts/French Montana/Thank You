[Hook – French Montana]
Same song
All around the world, same song
I want to thank you, thank you father
For shining your light on me
It’s been a long time
Since I’ve had someone to love me
Thank you, shine a light on me

[Verse 1 – Chinx]
Queens get the money, long time no cash
Caught up in the hustle where the guns gone blast
Retaliated so I had to think fast
Pulled out my heat first, he pulled out his heat last
In the belly of the beast, tryna throw rellies on the feets
My youngin caught a body in the lobby, got a homi on his piece
Stressed out, rolling up the leaf
Strapped on the waistline, money on my check mind
Early in the day time, we gon let it rain
Fuck a vacation, I ain’t tryna waste time
Nigga never play time, money in the bank
They going out they way to make you feel uncomfy
One time on the grind, tryna make a discovery
Tryna throw them cases on me
Put them funky ass bracelets on me

[Hook]

[Verse 2 – Bynoe]
I got em stuck off the realness, you feel this
Started from a 62, I ain’t looked back since
If it ain’t about a dollar then it don’t make sense
Shit was all good just a week ago
My youngin keep going back to jail
Rather send him text messages then have him read mail
Shackled on that bus for a long ride
Gladiator school where these fuck boys will switch sides
He who not with me is against me
Going all the way up that success ladder
I want to thank you for shining a light on me
Hit the Shepard in the head, watch the sheep scatter
Laughing to the bank like this shit funny
Watch face on Crip, I’m getting Blood money
Still a hood nigga mentality
Started from the bottom, real nigga reality

[Hook]
