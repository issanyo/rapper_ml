(Intro)
Aye, nigga, if you ain't coppin'
You ain't got no business around the fuckin' spot
Fuck you hangin' round the trap fo'?
Bout my dope house

(Pre-Hook)
Booking on the interstate
I'm bailing with them bricks
Cooking with the flour
Hit me if you need the fish
Bottom of the ninth
Choppers loaded, that's the ball game
Pussy, you a target and I barely ever miss

(Hook)
Fuck up out my dope house x 4

(Verse 1: French Montana)
Catch me in the black drop
Lookin' like I'm Fritz
Catch me in the back block
Tweekin' like the Nix
When I got a brick, flip it
Then I got a crib
Five cars, with it gone
Like I'm playin' fo' the Knicks
3 turned to 6 I was fuckin' up the commas
In the drop watch the top fall back like Madonna
'Dem young boys tryna hoop every work when I
Hit the curve, I was Tyson on the roof
They be playin' with 'em birds
Catch me on the Interstate, 95 South
Speedin' had the feed by 959
Post it on the block with the flower, need a fix
Klay Thompson with the rock, won't miss

(Hook)
Fuck up out my dope house x 4

(Pre-Hook)
Booking on the interstate

Choppers loaded, that's the ball game
Pussy, you a target and I barely ever miss

(Hook)
Fuck up out my dope house x 4

(Verse 2: Chinx)
Either hit the block or get a 9 to 5
Nigga pinch that rock or nigga won't survive
Count chicken pocks, I had to block the house
Nag at every bitch we want to fuck and call it drought
Fuck anotha nigga paper, gone and get yo own grip
Turnt to wake up early in the mornin' on my own dick
Told my young'n listen while you plan to get the whole grit
You the type to pull-up to the venue with my old bitch
Flocka finally made it, so ya know I bought 'em all
Twelve hit the trap, shook it down wall to wall
But we already skated on our way to Baltimore
Muthafuck 'em all, tell 'em bitches get the door

(Pre-Hook)
Booking on the interstate
I'm bailing with them bricks
Cooking with the flour
Hit me if you need the fish
Bottom of the ninth
Choppers loaded, that's the ball game
Pussy, you a target and I barely ever miss

Fuck up out my dope house x 4

(Verse 3: Jadakiss)
Yeah, fuck up out my dope house, where 'em niggas came from
Montega Jada, where you think I got the name from?
Raised round the junkies, where you think I got my game from?
Soon as the love stop, that's when the pain come
We ain't sellin' bundles either, we just movin' big shit
Tryna disappear with some work?! Get yo wig split
You can try to find a vein or you can sniff shit
Get it on the arm then I need a lil interest
Nah, you can't live with us, we don't want no visitors
People call us drug dealers, I say we're distributors
Haters gon' hate cuz we keep makin' 'em sick of us
Keep makin' it hot, they gon' think about evictin' us
Ball, nigga!
