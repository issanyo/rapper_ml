[Intro: French Montana]
Max
French Montana
Dame Grease
Coke Wave
This that more compatible music
This that shit
That got the fiends sellin' they whole mu'fuckin' crib

[Hook: Max B]
What you won't do for drugs
You think you got everything, but you gon' need drugs
You pawned your jewels for drugs
You done tried everything
But you gon' need drugs

[Verse 1: Max B]
I should've knew you was trouble right from the start
You stood in my corner, when that bitch broke my heart
You came through
Kept a brother up, I maintained
Tried to shut a brother up, fuck it I wouldn't listen
Knowing I'm living on the edge
Killed my brother in 91, 3 on his head
Choppers coming, we fled
It was me, Unc, and Bugaloo
Believe either one
Now tell me what you gonna do
Think I need a 50 piece
The shit that get my by get me high
We wanna do the shitty fly bitches, love when we fuck
Love when we come and light 'em up
Bite 'em up
Biggie come get in the truck
What you won't do

[Hook: Max B]
What you won't do for drugs
You think you got everything, but you gon' need drugs
You pawned your jewels for drugs
You done tried everything
But you gon' need drugs

[Verse 2: French Montana]
Fiends love the aroma
Catch me outside with my vest and my armor
All I see is green, homie I'm a farmer
Mines off top, fuck being formal
Always hit my phone up, meet me outside
Don't make it obvious, jump up in the ride
Say what you say, money on the table
Niggas move drugs, homie fuck the label
Granddaddy kush, make you cough a lung up
You can't go high, you can't go under
Homie I'm potent, O's and grams of the raw
Summer to the spring, and the winter to the fall
Pieces of the whole and the soft or the hard
Coke Wave niggas gon' fuck witcha boys

[Pre-Hook: Max B]
I miss you darling, where you been?
I been in court all day, and I need a smoke
Don't sip that Goose, know it fucks with gin
I got a thing for Grand Cru and I can't let go

[Hook: Max B]
What you won't do for drugs
You think you got everything, but you gon' need drugs
You pawned your jewels for drugs
You done tried everything
But you gon' need drugs
