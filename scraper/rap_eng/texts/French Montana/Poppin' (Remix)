Got a bitch in the projects, she be holdin her hammer
Landed in California, bout to go to Atlanta
To meet my bitch from Miami, she want beef on the table

[Verse 2: Rico Richie]
Hey, fuck 12 Eazy E voice (Fuck 12)
I had to get it out the streets had no choice
I pulled up to my P.O. in a Rolls-Royce
Your bitches fell in love with a D-boy
Richie bout his paper, bout his cheese boy
The streets gon vouch for me so I don’t need nothin
They couldn’t stop the boy, they couldn’t see it comin
Motherfucka, I’m tryna stack a hundred commas (Richie!)
Millions in the kitchen, put that on my mama (on my mama)
South beach, Richie eatin crab and lobster
I’m standing with some trappers you don’t want no problems
I’m standing with some killers, nigga blocka-blocka

[Pre-Chorus 2: Meek Mill]
I'm standin at a table full of trappers
I pop a Perc and take off like it's NASA
My niggas, they don't rap but look like rappers
Cause when we get that work, we flip it backwards, Lord

[Chorus 2: French Montana]
If you ain't got no paper, you ain't poppin
If you ain't got no paper, you ain't poppin it
If you ain't got no paper, you ain't poppin
If you don't got no paper, you ain't poppin it

[Verse 3: Meek Mill]
Meek Milly, uh, I used to dream of this shit
With my pen and my pad, I had a dream to get rich
But now I got all this money like I don't need all this shit
Can't talk no guns or no Phantom cause I done seen all this shit
I know I talk about stuntin you wanna cop you a rollie
But nigga save up your money, go get a block with yo homie
Bust it down with yo nigga, don’t try and flex for the street
Tryna stunt for them hoes, and have you broke in a week
I say, “Nigga you ain’t poppin,” I got all these options
I been 12’o’clock and Kawasakis through the projects
My niggas, they don't rap but look like rappers
Cause when we get that work, we flip it backwards, Lord

[Pre-Chorus 2: Meek Mill]
I'm standin at a table full of trappers
I pop a Perc and take off like it's NASA
My niggas, they don't rap but look like rappers
Cause when we get that work, we flip it backwards, Lord

[Chorus 2: French Montana]
If you ain't got no paper, you ain't poppin
If you ain't got no paper, you ain't poppin it
If you ain't got no paper, you ain't poppin
If you don't got no paper, you ain't poppin it

[Verse 4: French Montana]
You ran up on my set and tried to knock us
They heard I'm with the killers and the robbers
If I don't fire hammers and the choppers
I be ridin til they free Wavie Crockett
Catch ya sippin dirty at the house
My niggas, you don't rap cause you can't stop us
Luh ya papi, me and J. Lo in the projects
Nigga, you couldn't see us with binoculars
Hook game like coppers, brick squad like Flocka
Let the birds fly like the Falcons, ball like Francis with the Rockets
This that vintage Chanel, drinkin, twistin cigars
Mixin Cris in the dark, cryin, grippin the odds
Hit my man up, I had to go
Bulletproof sprinter, I be ridin like the Pope, Montana

[Pre-Chorus 1: Rico Richie]
I'm standing at a table full of bottles
I'm standing at a table full of robbers
Trust me nigga, you don't want no problems
You gon make them choppas blocka blocka yeah

[Chorus 1: Rico Richie]
If you ain't got no haters, you ain't poppin
If you ain't got no haters, you ain't poppin nigga
If you ain't got no haters, you ain't poppin
If you ain't got no haters, you ain't poppin nigga
