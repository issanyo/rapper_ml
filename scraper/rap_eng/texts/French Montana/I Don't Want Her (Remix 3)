[Intro: French Montana]
Sorry Jaynari...
You know when you hear that Haaan! Three hundred

[Pre-Hook: Eric Bellinger]

[Verse 1: Eric Bellinger]
Yeah she bad ain't she?
Why would I wanna keep her to myself?
I know you mad ain't ya?
‘Cause she only want me and no one else
I tell'er put her heels on
So she can show off them legs
But even with her clothes on, she turn heads

[Pre-Hook + Hook]
I see em looking at my woman
Haaa-ah

[Verse 2: French Montana]

Uh, they ain't lookin' at her then she ain't bad
There ain't a shoe [?] the book that she ain't have
I say she bad ain't she er'body want her
Caught her in that drop had to spin around the corner
She in love with them dope boys, Margiela’s
Mob fellas, front lawn four dealers
If they don't want her I don't want her neither (nope)
Dolce and Gabbana [?] from Giovanni's
Hol' up, hol' up, we them boy
Been tiptoeing on the marble floor
I mean, Olympic team twenty gold medals

[Bridge: Eric Bellinger] [2x]
If they ain't looking at my baby
Then it’s something wrong with me
If they ain't hating on what we got
I’mma need a new woman

If they ain't looking I don’t want her
(I see I can see 'em look yeah)
If they ain't looking I don’t want that girl
(you know I don’t want it)

[Hook: Eric Bellinger]
If they ain't looking I don’t want her
If they ain't looking I don’t want her
If they ain't looking I don’t want that girl
No
