[Intro: Max B]
Yo yo yo yo, this ya boy Max Biggavel right
Niggas be hatin' on that wave
Niggas be hatin' cuz they ain’t got that coke
Me and Macaroni with the cheese gon' talk to ya niggas
Let’s do it, uh

[Verse 1: Max B]
Now trick, I won't ask you
That ain’t what Max do
Let this shit be rolled to get at you
Back track 2 years ago
I was with niggas straight hatin
Maybe I’m bringin mo cake, nigga go and break that problems
Hoes on a nigga dick still
Thinkin you nigga bitch feel good like she bout to get 50 up
Them bitches see my bars, they get in the loop
Hit the coupe and cop cars, got the droptop Bentley
Niggas love the way the bars flow
35 at the cardinal, make the car pull on water
Cruising on 6, you’ll come
Let me take on a detour, G4
Nah baby, you flyin on jet blue bigger
Actin up in the black shoot, I can get you anything you want
Back rub the boss so it’s bigger and fresher to get mo bucks out

[Hook: Daft Punk/Max B]
Been around the world, now ya ya
That’s why they call us wavy
You don’t know tonight, you don’t know why
Homie is back on the wave

[Verse 2: French Montana]
My bitch from PR
Caddy all white like Lyor
Shades say Dior, turn the AC on
Niggas ridin past me
Flyin by old niggas, lookin all nasty
Homie catch me if you can it's the Gingerbread man
Coke wave, costume, you get to the tan
Boy where you be? Got yo baby ganjas in south Haiti with yo lady
Been around the world, made a couple million
Drug money stacked to the ceiling
Homie with them young gentlemen, been seized, send em in
If you don’t know they face, homie don’t send em in
Them hatin ass niggas, there they go again
In the Maybach
Nah French, that’s a Benz
Got a neck full of ice and a pocket full of cheese
Nigga please, I’m the macaroni with the cheese

[Hook:Daft Punk/Max B]

[Verse 3:Max B]
Coke wave, my light skin baby go both ways
I ain’t sleep in 4 days
Niggas know it’s the coke boy gigolo
And how you get yo dough never let a nigga know
Before I go I blow, buck popo
Got it fresh for dough, I love dodo
And when my dope low, when this shit slow froze
But the big 4-4 and slip her the coco
Oh no, boys don’t got em on me
We the team, please just justice and gang we win, niggas dream
Grabbing the 50 whole crew, got the marble
13, the joker uncle
French rule the world bout to make a zillion
GT, black no ceiling
Homie in the air, man, we be gold man, we them hood stars
Kids runnin up like that’s my car

[Hook: x2]

I don’t know why they hatin cuz
Cuz I fuckin hate it
Back in my Mercedes
Coke waving
