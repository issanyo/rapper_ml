[Hook: Future]
All my ice and all my trees, all my bitches in love with me
Rock star life, the life we lead, surrounded by rock stars
My niggas rocking gold like we're stuck back in the 80's
I seen my first M and damn near went crazy
I went and bought a Ghost and tried to crash a Mercedes
I fucked this nigga ho and almost made her my lady, hey
All my ice and all my trees, all my bitches in love with me
Rock star life, the life we lead, surrounded by a bunch of stars

[Verse 1: French Montana]
Started slingin' dope, momma looked at me crazy
Until I paid the rent, then she called me her baby
I tried to cop a Bent, that shit cost about eighty
And then I flipped a brick, broke that shit down to eights
Hey, cause all niggas slinging dope
Pray for the star, blowing smoke
They say they gon’ ride with me, no you won’t
Blowing money fast, and we blowin’ smoke
OG from California, sneeze and they run up on ya
Niggas freeze like they got pneumonia
Keep your lames, man, we don't want 'em
Cause those fake jewels we can’t pawn
Young niggas going crazy, have a mill for I have a baby, Montana baby
