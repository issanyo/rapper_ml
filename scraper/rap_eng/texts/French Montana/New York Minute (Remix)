[Chorus]
In a New York minute
Everything can change
In a New York minute
Things could get pretty strange
In a New York minute
Everything can change
In a New York minute

[French Montana]
You can get your neck broke, face cracked, laid flat
And give everything that you made back, eight clap
Make a sunvisor out ya wavecap
Pray that New York Minute'll bring Mase back
Shame that Remy took eight flat, you know the game whack
And every last rapper here tryna bring the name back
It ain't rap, niggas better stay strapped
Or you could call the stick-up boys, try to get your chain back
They thought the game was over
When B.I.G. died, then the homie Hov took it over
They shot Pac five times
Years later, them boys took Shyne
That ain't even the least
Akon signed the hottest nigga in the streets
We gave swagger to the game
Still and all, everything can change

[Chorus]
In a New York minute
Everything can change
In a New York minute
Things could get pretty strange
In a New York minute
Everything can change
In a New York minute

[Nicki Minaj]
Look back, fighting for the spot but I took that
Now all the kids want a Nicki Minaj book bag
Bitch, I been hard since my part had a zig-zag
Low pink Volvos, these bitches is bozos
Oh nos, eating them Ding-Dongs and HoHos
I was just tryna bubble, get past slo-mos
I ain't even ask for them XXL promos
I remember how it felt when the twin towers fell
I was in the Trump Towers looking for some shower gel
Rappers a just beef
Stack Bundles'll be deceased
Brought my man down, before they even get a cap and a damn gown
And there gotta be a Heaven
Cause Sean Bell'll never get to make it to his wedding
But a star will arise
And she'll originate from the streets of South Side

[Chorus]
In a New York minute
Everything can change
In a New York minute
Things could get pretty strange
In a New York minute
Everything can change
In a New York minute

[Jadakiss]
You could get your wig clapped, kidnapped, bitch-slapped
A two to four could turn into a six flat, if that
C-4 to your mom's front door, gift-wrapped
Whole fanbase could start thinking that your shit's wack
You could be at the gas station and get ya whip jacked
Get yapped, pay a nigga bread, get ya shit back
Right back, everything could change, just like that
Get pulled over on your way bringing that white back
Rappers stopped selling
Kim did a year and a day for not telling
Fox went deaf in one ear too, shortly after that she did a year or two
I beat the case, not enough evidence
Get ready to see a black President
You can download a whole album
Now you see where these niggas get their style from

[Chorus]
In a New York minute
Everything can change
In a New York minute
Things could get pretty strange
In a New York minute
Everything can change
In a New York minute
