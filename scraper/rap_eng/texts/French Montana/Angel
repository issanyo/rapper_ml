We could chill, have a fun time, baby, ayy
Take you 'round, get you wine and dine, baby, ayy
Whatcha like, I got nothin' but time, baby, ayy
Get your right, anything to make you mine, baby, ayy
I keep her flyer than angels, ayy
I beat it at different angles, ayy
Hold it down, I put in work, ayy
I hit these niggas where it hurt, ayy
We could chill, have a fun time, baby, ayy
Take ya 'round, get you wine and dine, baby, ayy
Whatcha like, I got nothin' but time baby, ayy
Get your right, anything to make you mine, baby, ayy

[Verse 1: Fetty Wap]
Rolex, bright link, couldn't add up to her
The times I would wait for you
The times they have for left you
The times I spent cake with you
The times that I would wait for your call
And you know how many times I took your ass to the mall
Baby, how many times I brought you out to show off
She want the whole damn store, and I'm buyin' it all
She want the whole damn lot, I'ma buy all the cars
And I make at all this gwap just to show you it's ours
How many times you seen me go crazy
Cause thought he was yours
I had to rearrange his face, I had to line up his jaw
And when we fuck, she screams "Zoo daddy"
But I'm ZooVier to y'all
Y'all niggas fuck around with my baby, that's the end of 'em all
I had his face over a T-shirt and his name on a wall
And when we fuck, she screams "Zoo daddy"
But I'm ZooVier to y'all
Y'all niggas fuck around with my baby, that's the end of 'em all
I had his face over a T-shirt and his name on a wall

I keep her flyer than angels, ayy

Hold it down, I put in work, ayy

[Verse 2: French Montana]
Take her to the spot, she got naked 'fore the door closed
Take you to the top, fuck your nigga, he gon' fall close
Neck, wrist, all froze, 20 watches, fo' rolls
2 Bentleys, 4 rows, drive 'em like they all stolen
Hunnid chains on, fuck a black out
I'mma hit it from the back till she pass out
White and black, bitch, call it two tone
Swerve it and out of lanes, I'm 2 and 0
All of my niggas, they with me, one hell of a night
Sippin' the bottles Henny, they ran out, we bought out the Remy
Pull up with him, there we're Lenny
He talkin' money, we got plenty
We pull up 'em niggas be grillin', Coke Boys to the ceilin'
