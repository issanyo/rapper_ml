[Intro: Chinx]
My nigga if you ain't coppin' you ain't got no business around the fucking spot
Fuck you hangin 'round the trap for?
Up out my dope house

[Hook: Chinx]
Booking on the interstate I'm bailing with them bricks
Cooking with the flour, hit me if you need the fish
Bottom of the ninth, choppers loaded, that's the ball game
Pussy you a target and I barely ever miss
Fuck up out my dope house
Fuck up out my dope house
Fuck up out my dope house
Fuck up out my dope house

[Verse 1: Chinx]
No degrees but did my thing in culinary
Either that or could've hit them courts and hoop
Creep up on them with them hammers we gon' nail em
Keep my pistols smoking like some Campbell soup
D.A. tryna lock me up for child abuse cause I was whippin' babies
In the daycare, and pushed em off the stoop
Chopper with the scope, tell them niggas merry Christmas
But it won’t be Santa Claus niggas sending through your roof
Catch a nigga hanging round the trap, he need to buy something
I’ma do the chicken dance with Flocka when them pies come
Pull up to the dock and park the V up on the boat
Pussy nigga, guarantee less than a key will get you smoked
When that money come in, you and some your niggas fall out
Hate it when you pull up to the venue with them cars out
All my diamonds blue, the jeweler got me on some loc shit
And them killers with me down to shoot, ain’t with no ho shit

[Hook: Chinx]

Pussy you a target and I barely ever miss
Fuck up out my dope house
Fuck up out my dope house
Fuck up out my dope house
Fuck up out my dope house

[Verse 2: Jadakiss]
Yeah, fuck up out my dope house, where them niggas came from
Montega Jada, where you think I got the name from
Raised round the junkies, where you think I got my game from
Soon as the love stop, that’s when the pain come
We ain’t selling bundles either, we just moving big shit
Try to disappear with some work, get your wig split
You can try to find a vein or you can sniff shit
Get it on the arm then I need a little interest
Naw you can’t live with us, we don’t want no visitors
People call us drug dealers, I say we distributors
Haters gone hate cause we keep making em sick of us
Keep making it hot, they gone think about evicting us

Fuck up out my dope house
Fuck up out my dope house
