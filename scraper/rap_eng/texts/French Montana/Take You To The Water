See I could take you to the water
But can’t help you drink
See I could take you to the water
But can’t help you drink
Put your head right
The same night
We’re doing everything
To not break
Blood thicker the water
Blood thicker the water
Blood thicker the water
Blood thicker the water
Blood thicker the water
Blood thicker the water
Blood thicker the water
Rich up in that, I triple my net worth
Hopping out the jet, shorty’s got that network
Started from a dollar baking soda wishes
When them hollas hitching niggas turning so religious
Million dollar me is got your baby momma creeping
Money rule her assets, that evil so possessive
Flashing, you know these niggas
Sloppy and they bogus niggas
Pass me with them stars, you ain’t half of what you hoes uh
Get down
Break it down
Shorty love
And I break it down
Thicken the water
Blood thicken the water
See I could take you to the water
But can’t help you drink
See I could take you to the water
But can’t help you drink
Put your head right
The same night
We’re doing everything
To not break
Blood thicken the water
Blood thicken the water
Blood thicken the water
Blood thicken the water
Blood thicken the water
Blood thicken the water
Blood thicken the water
Gotta do it on your own like fucker rings
30 chains on is the cold villas
Stacking money up, money 4 ceilings
Drinking bottle after bottle when before came this
Stacking hoes up, we need 4 sprinters
Versace shit, soak the shocker no limit
From the jump start we them cold killers
And you ain’t never dumb, you got 4 figures
Pray to God never get deported
Baby go and bust it open, let me pay your mortgage
Jewish marble, I ain’t need a carpet
Play the street, I don’t need a office
See I could take you to the water
But can’t help you drink
See I could take you to the water
But can’t help you drink
Put your head right
The same night
We’re doing everything
To not break
Blood thicken the water
Blood thicken the water
Blood thicken the water
Blood thicken the water
Blood thicken the water
Blood thicken the water
Blood thicken the water
Ayo I got that M and cheese all over her body
Mac & Cheese 3!
