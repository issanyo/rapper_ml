[Chorus: Lana Del Rey]
You, it's you it's all for you
Everything I do, I tell you all the time
Heaven is a place on earth with you
Tell me all the things you wanna do
I heard that you like the bad girls, Honey is that true?

[Verse 1: French Montana]
Made it lost it came back flipped it
Always faded, lifted
Hit that corner whipped
Hit the dealer, whipped it
Always on it, mind your business
I'm always high, the sky ain't the limit
Ball like Melo, cars all tinted
Chain black and yellow, Pittsburgh Steelers
Sport it knocked it tossed it flipped it
Took my flow and switched it, took my dough invested
Your whole life is scripted
All we do is party, drinkin', molly raggin', shawty raggin'
Money come retarted huh, press the button start it up
Tryna be a dope boy ridin' with a coke boy
Strap with the low boy 50 for a show boy
Niggas made it rain I made I it snow boy
Started with a dollar and a hope boy
Now a nigga hot got millions in the bank
Crib on the water spend a milly on the tank
Montana piece look silly on the link
Montana and Wiz spend millys on the dank

[Chorus: Lana Del Rey]
You, it's you it's all for you
Everything I do, I tell you all the time
Heaven is a place on earth with you
Tell me all the things you wanna do
I heard that you like the bad girls, Honey is that true?

[Verse 2: Wiz Khalifa]
Smoking weed in my expensive car
I'm ridin' high I'm flyin' high
Told you niggas say the shit you want
So don't even take the chance or try to try my guy
Designer sayin' supplies gettin' low
Weed man say it's kinda dry
Potty mouth, rockstar, at the top and still tryna climb
Drop the top sit back recline
Hundred-K that's just the ride
Fifty-K that's just the change
Thirty-K that's just the time
Tour came that's just in time
That's more racks, that's more racks
Private plane you know that's flyin'
I'm boardin' that I'm boardin' that
Rollin' up smoke roy ridin' with the coke boy
Smoking on strong pack hit it once choke boy
When I'm on the road bottles like dope boy
When the police come, I don't really know boy
Half a pound in seven days that's smokin'
If you ain't bout your family or getting bread you jokin'

[Chorus: Lana Del Rey]
You, it's you it's all for you
Everything I do, I tell you all the time
Heaven is a place on earth with you
Tell me all the things you wanna do
I heard that you like the bad girls, Honey is that true?

[Verse 3: Snoop Dogg]
Pick up the pace, turn up the bass
I'm singing this right in your face
I made the call forgive me
Cause I did this all for you
So whether you do or whether you don't
This gon' bang and this gon' bump
Hit your J or split your blunt
DPG then we turned up
Blue bandana, French Montana
All around the world first class
VIP, bubble bath
Touchdown, two points
Wide reciever Khalifa bless me with two joints
They told big dick Dogg, he gotta get up on this hit dog
Turn it up let me hear the beat for a second
Have a few puffs then I breathe on the record
Then we go like merri-go, round and round
This right here is for the underground
I wonder how, I break it down for you

[Chorus: Lana Del Rey]
You, it's you it's all for you
Everything I do, I tell you all the time
Heaven is a place on earth with you
Tell me all the things you wanna do
I heard that you like the bad girls, Honey is that true?
