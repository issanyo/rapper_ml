[Verse 1: French Montana]
Hit that block like twelve bundles
Now a nigga G-5 tell number
Reduce a fade, shades twelve hundred
You know a nigga hot, bitch, twelve summers
Ghost boy, thirty-four motherfucking show boy
Yeah, on the motherfucking road, boy
Chef on the motherfucking stove, boy, Coke Boy
Started from the lockout, now buy the block out
Started from a dropout
Now I bring that drop out
Hundred clip, small car, bad bitch, porn star
Get money like an athlete, fuck you thought?

[Hook (x2): Waka Flocka Flame]
Man, them fuck boys know
Ain't no wins over here
We gon' fight and fucking shoot 'til our souls disappear
Fuck next year, it's 'bout now, nigga
Disrespect coming, knock you down, nigga
He bleed like me, scared of no nigga
Call me anything but a broke nigga

[Verse 2: Waka Flocka Flame]
Tripping off a molly, wish a fuck nigga try me
Tony got ru's in New York, California, and Raleigh
Too turnt, bad bitches all in to party
Playing with they nose, yeah, they high off that Bobby
Sorry, you broke and I got money
Flexed hard on 'em with the blood-red Rari
Young boss shit, can't run a Maserati
Every day call fly spirit in an Audi
Free throw, and one, two hands nigga, Elijah Thomas, nigga
Run that shit the fuck back
I’m from where the boys get rowdy
Disrespect me get your head on a bounty
No pussy nigga, just real niggas around me
Keep your head above water before a nigga drown me
Doubt me, that’s a no-no nigga
Love my boys, no homo, nigga
Pulled up, no mask, dolo no nigga
Bank account with me never solo, nigga
Led a couple shots, now he holding his, nigga
Waka Flocka Flame show rapping more realer
Run down Grove feeling like Godzilla
808 blunts, inhaling that killer
You tripping
Can't stand up on Xans
Cooking dope with no frying pans
Yeah, it taste good, no Auntie Anne’s
You see that flag hanging out my pants

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Frenchie]
Flocka, that blunt, nigga, you need to pass it
BSM forever macking
Throw it up, nigga, what’s cracking?
What’s happening?
I’m walking inside of that club and I’m getting that strapping
Speed action
So if I said that I’m gon' no need for you asking
BSM all about a check
You might hate us but you gon' show respect
Nigga wanna act like hoes
I’ma show you how that pussy get wet
You ain't 'bout that life
But you stay talking like you think you is
I got all this ice
It’s a frozen day when I throw my wrists
Niggas fucking your chick
It’s more sell than it gets
Fight me over some money
Nigga, don’t shoot me over no bitch
Frenchie all on his shit
You iced up, you a lick
Bands will make her dance
But this forty'll make you strip
Yeah

[Hook]
