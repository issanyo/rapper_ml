[Intro: French Montana]
Nah, nah, don't do it
Ba-baby, nah, nah, don't do it (I know)
Nah, nah, don't do it
You know what it is when you hear that, haan!

[Verse 1: Era Istrefi]
Pull up, we can do it all night
Do it at a stoplight
Red light, special for ya
Do what I let you
Boy you poppin', yeah you know I got it
All night, overdrivin'
No, it ain't no stopping

[Chorus: Era Istrefi]
Fall in love, don't do it
Nah, nah, don't do it
Nah, nah, don't do it
Don't do it
Keep your head on right
Do it just how I like
Nah, nah, don't push it
Nah, nah, don't push it
Yeah, do it just how I like
Don't front, don't front, don't front
But no I love yous

[Post-Chorus: Era Istrefi]
Don't want a love
We can do it all night
We can do this all the time
But no I love yous
Don't want a love
We can do it all night
We can do this all the time
But no I love yous
Pull up, pull up, we gon' make that money
Pull up, pull up, we gon' make that money then blow it

[Verse 2: Era Istrefi]
Pull up, we can do it all week
Ring up, you know where to call me
Bedroom, silk, private
Keep it where I left you
Boy, you watching, yeah I know you watching
You know, you ain't gonna hide it
No it ain't no stopping

[Chorus: Era Istrefi]
Find a love, don't do it
Nah, nah, don't do it
Nah, nah, don't do it
Don't do it
Keep your head on straight
Just might give it lil' taste (give it lil' taste)
Nah, nah, I don't push him
Nah, nah, I don't push him
Yeah, since you know what I wanna do
(Don't front, don't front, don't front)
Baby I just wanna fuck with you

[Post-Chorus: Era Istrefi]
But no I love you's
Don't want a love
We can do it all night
We can do this all the time
But no I love yous
Nah, nah, I don't push him
Nah, nah, I don't push him
Don't do it
We can do it all night
Don't do it
We can do this all the time

[Verse 3: French Montana]
Hoppin' out the Phantom or the Benzo
Never in the friend zone
Jumping like James in the end zone
Smoking that indo'
Baby, don't pull down the window
Hit it in the back, with the tints though
Pull up, pull up, pull up
Seven cars all week
Quiet Storm like Mobb Deep
China silk baby, gold sheets
Yacht through the islands, like four weeks
You know that sand all white, know we turn up all night
And the water all blue, and that fish don't bite (I know, I know)
Nah, nah, don't do it
Baby, nah, nah, don't do it
Nah, nah, don't do it
We gon' make that money then blow it (I know)
G5, no cameras (don't front, don't front, don't front)
You know they call me Montana, (Montana!)
Haaan

[Chorus: Era Istrefi]
No I love yous
Nah, nah, don't do it
Nah, nah, don't do it
Don't want a love
We can do it all night
We can do this all the time
But no I love yous
Nah, nah, don't do it
Nah, nah, don't do it
Don't want a love
We can do it all night
We can do this all the time
But no I love yous
Nah, nah, don't do it
Nah, nah, don't do it
We can do it all night
We can do this all the time
But no...
