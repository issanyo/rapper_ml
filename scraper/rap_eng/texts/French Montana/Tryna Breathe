[Chorus]
Shorty go down she ain't tryna breathe awwooo
I be tryna get away sometimes, yeah
Don't judge me I'm just tryna live awwooo
I be tryna clear my mind, yeah

[Verse 1]
You don't know me and the shit I'm in
5th of Henn blend with the bread like cinnamon
Cocaine white like Letterman
Niggas thinking they can stop the wave Montana better think again
Bitches, dog them once then they bring a friend
Acting like you turned out you was never innocent
Started with the wave started bringing all the business in
Told my nigga Max you know I couldn't make it until the sentence end
History in the making what you witnessing
Cocaine raw, it numb your whole face you can't feel your chin
You know you fuckin with the killers and dealers and
Hold 360 to a business man, reel us in

[Chorus]
Shorty go down she ain't tryna breathe awwooo
I be tryna get away sometimes, yeah
Don't judge me I'm just tryna live awwooo
I be tryna clear my mind, yeah

[Verse 2]
I'm in the kitchen with a vision like a hawk
You can check the numbers out we ain't gotta talk, Montana
Shoutout my nigga Penthouse, Zack and Reef
Nigga knee deep and I ain't never think about rapping neither
Ask Joli O',​​​​ bitches catch the holy ghost
Niggas rap a lot but we do the most through the coast
All my niggas ridin out
Old niggas dying out
All it take is one look
Montana sliding out
You know you fuckin with a star
Come and fuck with them bars
Took over the streets, and we ain't even going hard
With Dame Grease, Los,​​ bomb bitches deep throat
You know I'm on point like a free throw
Coke Boy

[Chorus]
Shorty go down she ain't tryna breathe awwooo
I be tryna get away sometimes, yeah
Don't judge me I'm just tryna live awwooo
I be tryna clear my mind, yeah
