[Drita Davanzo]
It's Drita here, Mr. Montana
All crickets keep chirping all motherfucking day
Mob wives in the house for this shit

[Hook: French Montana]

[Verse: Drita Davanzo]
Mob ties,mob wives
Sipping Mai Tais
These are Gucci jeans: No Levi's
Red bottoms, I'm the fucking baddest in the club
I'm no golfer but I'm known to keep a couple clubs
Ciroc bottles all around: we still Ciroc bitches
You know the Allens' motto: bitches get stitches
Duffle bags of that cash, we don't use credit
We want something, we don't wait, we just go get it
We just go get it, spend it like theres no limit
You as fake as fuck, I'm just rolling with it
White Cadillac, bullet-proof window kit
I'm at the Drunken Monkey drinking like a lunatic
Big Ang's gonna carry me out, you know how Drita do
Drunk and I'm ready to fight, shit, I don't need a crew
Punched teeth fall out your mouth, you gonna need 'em new

[Outro: Drita]
It's the rock mob
Mob ties
--------?
Your gonna get a red dot

[Hook]
