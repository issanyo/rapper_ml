Woah
Woah
Drinks in the air like, everybody feel like
Woah
Woah
Everybody hands in the sky like, we run the night like
Woah
Woah
Drum beatin' harder than a bongo
She drop it down low
Woah
Woah
Up on the seams they watch me now

[Verse 1: Massari]
Gotta light the shisha, then we pass the Chardonnay
Poppin' bottles we ain’t leaving till the morning
Let me see you put your lighters in the air
Shorty wine up on my body like you want it
She movin' fast, she winin' slow
She’s tellin' me, that she’s ready to go
I’m spending cash, geronimo, when Massari in the party make the club go

Bom ba-ba-bom bom bom bom bom
Bom ba-ba-bom bom bom
Bom ba-ba-bom bom bom bom bom
Bom ba-ba-bom bom bom

[Verse 2: Massari]
Watching me, watching me like a movie in a club
We run tings, know a-big tings we run
Rock wit me, rock wit me, got'cha body burnin' up
Push it back on me, touching me, like you wanna give it up
I wanna, pull you pon your waist, you’ll never wanna leave
I got you right where you wanna be
And I know, tonight I’m gonna make you fall in love with me
Girl I’ll be makin' your body scream

[Verse 3: French Montana]
I got what you want, pull up and stunt
Right, right lookin like first of the month
I'm talking forty a feature, Bad bitch on the Shisha
And then we cash out smoking smoking that Keysha
Hide till the morning, Bad baddy I'm ?
Watch em land on the chalk, came out fresh now I'm coming
I know I talk like a pimp, with the Ghost like a Mac
Taking off like a ship, Play that post like Shaq
Call it fever for money, Morocco all sunny
Put the med on the wheel, Thirty chains on my stomach
Got plenty to smoke, Champagne for the pain
Doing doing the most, you know we running the game
MONTANA!
