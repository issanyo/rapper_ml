[Intro]
Hey, yeah
Watch-watch-watch this

[Hook: French Montana]
Standin' on the couch, we got it lit (yeah)
Scorin' with your bitch, now that's a swish (yeah)
It's a movie every time our diamonds flick (every time)
Leave it up to me, this money I'ma get it (haah)
I'ma get to the money every night (oh)
When I see her I'ma hit her every night (oh yeah)
I throw it up, she bust it open every time (oh)
I throw it up, she bust it open every time

[Verse 1: French Montana]
I do it every time, do it every time
Diamonds blue, Carolina shinin' every time
Top off while we smoke the weed up
Diamonds shine like cop cars by the P's
Hit it once and I'ma do it all over
Chargin' double for the ounce, I'm ridin' with the Cobra
If it ain' the blue, I mixed the Henny with the soda
100,000 ones, watch them bad bitches clean it up
Every time I see her, she bust it open every time
When the feds hit you, you was tellin' every time
When the cameras hit us, we was shinin' every time
Pull up to the spot, Europeans every time

[Hook: French Montana]
Standin' on the couch, we got it lit (yeah)
Scorin' with your bitch, now that's a swish (yeah)
It's a movie every time our diamonds flick (every time)
Leave it up to me, this money I'ma get it (haah)
I'ma get to the money every night (oh)
When I see her I'ma hit her every night (oh yeah)
I throw it up, she bust it open every time (oh)
I throw it up, she bust it open every time

[Verse 2: Jeezy]
Nothin' but the truth in every line
I need all mine nigga, every dime
My diamonds dancin', Kevin Federline
Who got the plug on the Britney? Never mind
What you know bout havin' 60 for a kilo?
Told 'em give me two nigga like a free throw
Nothin' but net baby, swish
Got that Smart Water on my wrist
See that California came with them horses
How bout you let me fuck your friend? That bitch is gorgeous
.40 on my waist, Avion and Ace
Full clip every time, we shootin' out the Wraith, ay

[Hook: French Montana]
Standin' on the couch, we got it lit (we got it lit)
Scorin' with your bitch, now that's a swish (that's a swish)
It's a movie every time our diamonds flick (every time)
Leave it up to me, this money I'ma get it (hey)
I'ma get to the money every night (every time)
When I see her I'ma hit her every night (every time)
I throw it up, she bust it open every time (hey)

Every time, every time
