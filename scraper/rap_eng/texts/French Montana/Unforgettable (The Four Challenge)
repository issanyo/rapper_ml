[Chorus]
It's not good enough for me
Since ive been with you, Ooh
No it ain't, No it ain't noo
Its not gonna work for you
Nobody can equal me, no

Im gonna sip on this drink when im messed up
Should know how to pick em
I'm gonna catch the rhythm while she push up against me
Ooh, and she tipsy

I had enough convo for 24
I peep'd you from across the room
Pretty little body, dancing like GoGo, aye

And you are unforgettable
I need to get you alone
Why not, Why not, Why not, Why not, Why not

A good time never hurt nobody
Got a little drink but it's not your body
You're on your level too
Tryna do what lovers do

Feelin' like I'm fresh out, Boosie
If they want the drama, got the Uzi
Ship the whole crew to the cruise ship
Doin' ---- you don't even see in movies
Ride with me, ride with me boss
I got a hard head, but her heart soft
She want the last name with the ring on it
She get what she want 'cause she unforgettable
