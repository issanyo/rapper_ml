[Intro]
Hey friends, hey friend
Let me tell you a little story friend
Let your kick in the mouth
Let me tell the real story if you was put in the ropes
Brrp, stick up, ha-haha, stick up
Stick up, ha-haha, stick up
Stick up, ha-haha, stick up

[Hook]

Cause I'm heated, heated, heated

Cause I'm heated, heated, heated
I'm heated, please stop it

[Verse 1]
Go get the broom now sweep it up
Bump on the scene with the gangster lean
Bitch you in the major league, major league
Money ain't a thing to me
Don't complain to me
How she gettin' next me
Pull up in the scene with the gangster lean
Bitch, shawty got things for me
I got my sandals, no socks
I ain't payin' for the box
I can't sleep around
I don't know where you found
Ass fat, gotta move around
All my life I done built it from the ground
Surround sound
Swim with the sharks shoulda drowned
She try to smoke my whole pound
Had to hit the Dogg Pound
Like wassup
I heard you put a needle through the condom
Tried to rob 'em

[Hook]
Cause I'm heated, heated, heated
I'm heated, heated, heated
He-he-he-heated, I'm heated
Heated, heated, heated, I'm heated, please stop it
I'm heated
Heated, heated, heated, I'm heated, please stop it
Cause I'm heated
Heated, heated, heated, I'm heated, please stop it
I'm heated
Heated, heated, heated, I'm heated, please stop it
Cause I'm heated

[Verse 2]
Go get the broom now sweep it up
MC with the gangster plan
Bitch you gotta make the band
Bitch you might take the stand
Actin' like you ain't the gram
Man make the money, the money never make the man
Fall back, I'm cooler than a fan
Came up with a master plan
With nothin' but sweat inside my hand
Brp, sick up, ha-haha, sick up
I ain't trust a nigga
I fucked her through the zipper
Fuck police, try to hit me with a ticket
Heard my man hit her raw so I ain't wanna lick her
Got a Coach bag but you ain't no player
Take another pill bitch, stay up
All she wanna do is smoke
Bitch want blood, heard she fuckin' with a locc
Hello, balling like 'Melo
From the ghetto, Lamborghini yellow
What's up
I know where I come from, I know where I'm goin'
And I can keep on flowing
I bet she stole cash in my pocket
I can't knock it
Told me to take her to the tropics
Gotta get the biscotti

[Hook]
Cause I'm heated, heated, heated
I'm heated, heated, heated
He-he-he-heated, I'm heated
Heated, heated, heated, I'm heated, please stop it
I'm heated
Heated, heated, heated, I'm heated, please stop it
Cause I'm heated
Heated, heated, heated, I'm heated, please stop it
I'm heated
Heated, heated, heated, I'm heated, please stop it
Cause I'm heated

[Outro]
Cause I'm heated
Stick up, ha-haha, stick up
Cause I'm heated
Stick up, ha-haha, stick up
Stick up, ha-haha, stick up
I'm heated
