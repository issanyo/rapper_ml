[Chorus]
I copped a house on the hills on the west side
I'm out in Cali smokin', shorty, we blazin'
Kept a 100, 100 strong on the east side
Hit the hood, they be goin' crazy
Too much hate, too much hate
Too much pay, too much pay
Too much talk, too much talk
Too much cloth, too much cloth
Too much floss, I take two months off
Two months off, too much talk
Too much cloth, haaan

[Verse 1]
Young Blood, 212 with a 12 gauge pump
Try to bring the foreigns out, hit the hood like Trump
Hills party like Women's March, piranhas killin' sharks
You ain't built, don't talk too much cloth
Mi young boys hit you, have you drippin' too much sauce
Hooked up to the IV, yeah, few months off
Snipe squad, roof top, dump, free Bump Stacks
Wanna catch me slippin' like they caught Meek on the steps
Yeah, baby tryna find her way, but it ain't nothin' pure
Twice as much, baby, you ain't twice is more
Caught a crib on the west side, Selena
Started from the block with a pack, shawty mad

[Chorus]
I copped a house on the hills on the west side
I'm out in Cali smokin', shorty, we blazin'
Kept a 100, 100 strong on the east side
Hit the hood, they be goin' crazy
Too much hate, too much hate
Too much pay, too much pay
Too much talk, too much talk
Too much cloth, too much cloth
Too much floss, I take two months off
Two months off, too much talk
Too much cloth, haaan

[Verse 2]
Too many stories, too many pages
Too many real niggas in too many cages
Too many fake niggas with too many faces
Too many war stories, on too much medication
Put the game in a chokehold, squeeze 'til ain't nothin' left
Too many round
Peel my top back, watch it crystal meth
Too much cut coke, too much floss
There's too much cutthroat, there's too many bosses
Puff about to hit a billi', I'm on a hundred mil' burglary
I know you heard of me, fresh off that hell rap surgery
Put some gravel in your car, talk and bought the bar (too much talk)
Know you heard of us, nigga, talkin' New York

[Chorus]
I copped a house on the hills on the west side
I'm out in Cali smokin', shorty, we blazin'
Kept a 100, 100 strong on the east side
Hit the hood, they be goin' crazy
Too much hate, too much hate
Too much pay, too much pay
Too much talk, too much talk
Too much cloth, too much cloth
Too much floss, I take two months off
Two months off, too much talk
Too much cloth, haaan

[Outro]
Montana!
