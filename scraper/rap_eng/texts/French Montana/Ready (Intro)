[Intro]
Yeah
I'm not a fool
I just laugh at you dead inside
I'm not a fool
I'm just lifeless, haha
Haan, yeah

[Hook]
When I got the spaceship
Chop the top off, got the brain out
Smoke and drink, take her to the crib what the brain bout?
All my niggas playin', we ain't talkin' what that bread bout, haan?
Smokin' medication, got my bread right
Niggas try to stop us, we ain't gon' let 'em
Bitches try to trap us, we ain't gon' let 'em
Man,  we just get ready
Haah, we just get ready

[Verse 1]
Talk about bread, God damn, got a whole lot
Said Pray to the one then niggas get to ball out
God damn, watch the ball work
Got rich, put 'em on work
Finish last, nigga ball first
Now curve bitches cold turkey
In the game nigga, no mercy
For the weak nigga
Feel "froggish" than leap nigga!
Shoot the shepherd and the sheep nigga
From my head to my feet nigga
Countin' millions before while I sleep nigga
High school to the league nigga
Pull up on them hoes, watch it fall out
'Rari sittin' low, gotta crawl out
If that pussy wet, never pull out
If that pussy good, buy the mall out
Sittin' court side in my court case
Drinkin' lean, poppin' pills, heart racin'
Velvet rope, blue dot, all Ace
36 O's, foundation
Word around town, I'm the man nigga
Breakin' down work to the grams nigga
Whip it in the Pan nigga
Gettin' money with the fam nigga

[Hook]
When I got the spaceship
Chop the top off, got the brain out
Smoke and drink, take her to the crib what the brain bout?
All my niggas playin', we ain't talkin' what that bread bout, haan?
Smokin' medication, got my bread right
Niggas try to stop us, we ain't gon' let 'em
Bitches try to trap us, we ain't gon' let 'em
Man,  we just get ready
Haah, we just get ready

[Verse 2]
Aye, young nigga from the trap, bitch can't trap me
Young cold nigga get money like an athlete
Now I'm straight like 12:30
Pussy clean, baby talk dirty
Need the work nigga, call early
Rap game sabotage and we gon' burn it
Nigga cold murder
And I'm comin' for ya head nigga
And I did what I said nigga
Mine get it how I live nigga
Go playin' with the bread nigga
I blow off your dread nigga
Get the hoes sprayin' nigga
From the bottom it was all I
Told your whole story, it was all lies
Drink and smoke till I fall out
Thought he get the bread and it's all out
Nah nigga, jumped in the fire nigga
Still ridin' with the fire nigga
Countin' money, gettin' high nigga
Praise due to the high nigga
But my niggas on set, I can die nigga
Started from the block nigga
I done earned my spot nigga
From the bottom, couldn't see the top nigga
Coke Boy non-stop nigga

[Hook]
