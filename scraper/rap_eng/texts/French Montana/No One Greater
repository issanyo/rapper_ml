[Intro]
You love me
You wouldn’t cheat
You would never leave me

[Verse 1: French Montana]
Shorty do the most
Remember we was close?
Flew them private planes
Came back on them boats
One that gave you money
Said you wanted love
When I gave you love
Said you wanted money
All that fighting and that calling back, played out
Got me riding in that spaceship, spaced out
We was the dream team nothing could stop
Now you got me sitting on my hands shaking, Waka Flocka
Sometimes you gotta laugh to cry out
Knowing if I leave you, shorty always down to ride out
Me and Meek, Ashanti pouring up
You gonna leave me and go back to what? Montana

[Verse 2: Ashanti]
I’m kind of mad that I love you
Because even when I try to move on
I still be thinking of you
I’m trying to get away from you
Because all this stress in my life is all because of you
You don’t see what you got with me and I know it
My mind says stop but heart keep going
I’m so sick getting caught up (Caught up)
It’s got you doing what your doing
I ain’t even being thought of

[Hook: Ashanti]
You got me
You told me you love me
You said that you wouldn’t cheat
You said that could never leave me

[Bridge: Ashanti]
No one, no
No one, no
No one, no
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 3: Ashanti]
I thought I told you I ain’t every other chick (Yeah)
You need to understand who your dealing with (Yeah)
Cause I ain’t gonna stay putting up with this
You keep saying that you gon’ change
But it seems like you just set in your ways
Telling me your selfish but you, you can’t help it
If you loved me like you said then you wouldn’t need no one elses, cause

[Hook: Ashanti]
You got me
You told me you love me
You said that you wouldn’t cheat
You said that could never leave me

[Bridge: Ashanti] x2
No one, no
No one, no
No one, no
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 4: Meek Mill]
I’m just a young nigga ballin, living my life
But every time I make it home, it’s like we get in a fight
I bet you couldn’t name another girl that’s living this nice
Thirty cash on Birkin bags, baby look at the price
And that was just the make up and then we wake up then we break up
Then I never say much tears dripping all on your make up
Then we up in Jacob — jeweler fucking that cake up
Tripin Jamaica, trying to save us just for the sake of our relationship
Taking trips and making trips
Got your friends checking my twitter telling you hating shit
Make a wish, I was up in the studio making hits
You thinking I’m with a groupie or ghouling out with them
I’ve said a lot of things, did a lot of dirt
You gotta give me credit though I try and make it work
Before you ever met me, I was a player first
But now you got my heart and all I say is church, amen

[Bridge: Ashanti]
No one, no
No one, no
No one, no
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Hook: Ashanti]
You got me
You told me you love me
You said that you wouldn’t cheat
You said that could never leave me

[Bridge: Ashanti]
No one, no
No one, no
No one, no
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
