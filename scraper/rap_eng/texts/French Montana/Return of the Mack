[Verse 1]
I was drunk on that Patron
Cause I never knew
When you made your move
And you said you with your crew
I should of knew it from the start
Bitch you are a slut
Tried to break my heart
Should've knew you was a whore

[Refrain]
Bitch you a slide to me
All that shit u said you'll never do
You lied to me
Bitch you did, bitch you did
Bitch you a slide to me
All that shit you said you'll never do
You lied to me
Bitch you did bitch you did
Return of the mack

[Verse 2]
All the way skeezer
You ain't have to lie from it
Like you were a keeper
Should've know it
When I let you meet Kon
You tried to dog my nigga and blamed it on Patron
Then when you met Flex
When you met Enuff
Should've called your bluff
I guess one nigga ain't enough
A club-hopper, pill-popper
Actin' like an unschooled boy-bopper
I guess love don't love nobody
Cupid hit me with a shottie
Gave a bad name to the next one
It's a dice game tryin' to pick one

[Refrain]
