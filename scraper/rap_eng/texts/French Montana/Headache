[Intro: French Montana]
Haan!

[Hook: French Montana]
Small talk, give me a headache
Fuck boys, give me a headache
Fake bitches, give me a headache
Little money, give me a headache
All them fake jewels give me a headache
Bitch fake bag, give me a headache
Hatin' niggas give me a headache
Hatin' bitches give me a headache
Vacatin' when you niggas don't
You got a nigga how you want
100 chains, I'm cold blooded
Land on your head nigga, no luggage

[Verse 1: Rick Ross]
It get hot up in the streets, we always cookin' beef
Why are you tellin' on the gang, could of took a plea
Young shooters we recruitin' like we Booker T
Hit em in the club so he went and took a seat
Nigga leakin' like a album week before release
Use to run the world, now he barely on his feet
Ski mask in the suite, sticks in the uber
Tailgatin' on the streets, bricks in the cooler
Gettin' money, never cared that LeBron left
Cause I thought that gettin' wealthy was the concept
I just want to be the richest, they say I'm the nicest
Money team 1990, I'm Michael Tyson
Get your money IRS, give me a headache
Every record that them niggas make, give me a headache
(Arizona weed) give me a headache
(Bitches lyin' on me) give me a headache

[Hook: French Montana]
Small talk, give me a headache
Fuck boys, give me a headache
Fake bitches, give me a headache
Little money, give me a headache
All them fake jewels give me a headache
Bitch fake bag, give me a headache
Hatin' niggas give me a headache
Hatin' bitches give me a headache
Vacatin' when you niggas don't
You got a nigga how you want
100 chains, I'm cold blooded
Land on your head nigga, no luggage

[Verse 2: Rick Ross]
Valet at the spot, they put my name on it
Fuck her like a beat, you know I came on it
Root got a league, I make it rain on it
I kill for your prayer, do the same on it
Wood seats at the game, they call it Ricky row
She dancin' on my dick until she tippy-toe
Pullin' on them pistols till they tappin' out
Tink, tink, tink, tink, tink
Blue denim jeans, black bite jacket
Propofol, a nigga had a mic habit
Lean to the left, lean to the right
Clean or death get you buried on sight
Weak links in the camp, give me a headache
We never get em cause we hit em double MOB
Hood Billionaire but a bird on it
Be a man, know your word, now you worth somethin'

[Hook: French Montana]
Small talk, give me a headache
Fuck boys, give me a headache
Fake bitches, give me a headache
Little money, give me a headache
All them fake jewels give me a headache
Bitch fake bag, give me a headache
Hatin' niggas give me a headache
Hatin' bitches give me a headache
Vacatin' when you niggas don't
You got a nigga how you want
100 chains, I'm cold blooded
Land on your head nigga, no luggage

[Verse 3: French Montana]
All that consignment, give me a headache
My baby momma, give me a headache
Lookin' through this fog, give me a headache
Talkin' to you show, give me a headache
Wake up in the mornin', with a headache
Mixin' white and brown, give me a headache
Closet like fashion week, at Milan
Armor from Lebanese, Lebanon

[Hook: French Montana]
Small talk, give me a headache
Fuck boys, give me a headache
Fake bitches, give me a headache
Little money, give me a headache
All them fake jewels give me a headache
Bitch fake bag, give me a headache
Hatin' niggas give me a headache
Hatin' bitches give me a headache
Vacatin' when you niggas don't
You got a nigga how you want
100 chains, I'm cold blooded
Land on your head nigga, no luggage
