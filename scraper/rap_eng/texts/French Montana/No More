[Intro: French Montana]
You know what it is when you hear that (hah)

[Verse 1: Zion & Edwin]
Señorita I ain’t tryna play (nah nah nah)
I been thinking you should get a taste
You gon' wanna put me on the case (yeah)
Right away, right away, aye, aye-aye-aye
They all tryna keep you on the block (on the block, yeah)
Imma take you Italy, no stops
You gon' wanna kick it at the spot  (uh, yeah)
Right away, right away, aye, aye-aye-aye

[Pre-Chorus: Brandon]
Aye-aye-aye, meet me on the roof
Aye-aye-aye, I’m feeling the views
Aye-aye-aye, no, don't be confused
Girl you ain’t gon' be wasting time

[Chorus: PRETTYMUCH]
Tell me what you want cause I just can’t wait no more
Tell me where you are cause I just can’t wait no more
I wanna be the one but I just don’t know if I can wait no more
No more, no more, no more, no more
Tell me what you want cause I just can’t wait no more
Tell me where you are cause I just can’t wait no more
I wanna be the one but I just don’t know if I can wait no more
No more, no more, no more, no more

[Verse 2: Edwin & Brandon]
Señorita, where you wanna go (where you wanna go, go?)
I can show you things you never know
Podemos escapar nosotros dos
Right away, right away, aye, aye-aye-aye
And I just wanna kiss you on the beach
I can make you elevate your dreams
All he do is catch it and release
What you say? What you say? Aye-aye-aye

[Pre-Chorus: Brandon,  Nick]
Aye-aye-aye, meet me on the roof (on the roof)
Aye-aye-aye, I’m feeling the views
Aye-aye-aye, no, don't be confused
Girl you ain’t gon' be wasting time

[Chorus: PRETTYMUCH & Zion]
Tell me what you want cause I just can’t wait no more
Tell me where you are cause I just can’t wait no more
I wanna be the one but I just don’t know if I can wait no more
No more, no more, no more, no more
Tell me what you want cause I just can’t wait no more (I can't wait)
Tell me where you are cause I just can’t wait no more (where you are girl)
I wanna be the one but I just don’t know if I can wait no more
No more, no more, no more, no more

[Interlude: Zion & PRETTYMUCH, & French Montana]
I can’t wait (wait)
I can’t wait (wait)
I can’t wait, no more
I can’t wait (wait)
I can’t wait (wait)
You know what it is when you hear that

[Verse 3: French Montana & Nick]
I told her baby come and snatch me from the block (right away)
We ain’t thinking ‘bout tomorrow, want it now (right away)
Hello, hello mamacita, the weekdays and the weekend
Same bars with The Weeknd, they call me Montana
Fell in love right away, French know the repertoire
Bonjour, oh my god, pulled up in, au revoir
She’s, feeling the view
Feet, up in the coupé
Like a film though
We kicked it at Melrose
I can't wait no more, baby

[Chorus: PRETTYMUCH]
Tell me what you want cause I just can’t wait no more
Tell me where you are cause I just can’t wait no more
I wanna be the one but I just don’t know if I can wait no more
No more, no more, no more, no more
Tell me what you want cause I just can’t wait no more
Tell me where you are cause I just can’t wait no more
I wanna be the one but I just don’t know if I can wait no more
No more, no more, no more, no more
