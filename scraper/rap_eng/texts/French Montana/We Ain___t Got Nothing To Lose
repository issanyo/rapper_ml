[Hook: Akon]
We ain't got nothin to proove
Cause we get it poppin for real, yeah
It's French Montana and Akon, that's how we do it
We ain't got nothing to proove
Cause you know we keep it poppin for real
It's Akon and French Montana ?

[Verse 1: French Montana]
Album done, the livest one
Guns longer than Iverson
Na, homie, Imma ride up front
Big died in the passinger's seat, Pac died in the passinger's seat
Na, nigga, Imma drive my shit
Game wack, tryna get out this shit
You know coke like damb, 50 a gram
I don't know Hov, but 50 my man
Still fuck with Yayo, a mearical wip
? knock you out your seat, KO
We got a story to tell, my nigga D Rock used to write me from jail
Like, "homie, never take a day off, and soon enough, it'll pay off"
? diamond? fam
I don't talk no man down
Do your thing homie, I fuck with Akon, African Mob
Niggas used to say "French, stay off that hard"
Caught cases, deportations, fight all that
Settle for the probations
? tell me what to do ? bitch took ? to my crib
Sometimes you gotta talk to them, then walk out
Then my nigga got to m
Nigga, can't front, I really need her
? first of the month, homie came through with the incom tax, next January, a bitch come back
[Hook: Akon]
We ain't got nothin to proove
Cause we get it poppin for real, yeah
It's French Montana and Akon, that's how we do it
We ain't got nothing to proove
Cause you know we keep it poppin for real
It's Akon and French Montana ?
