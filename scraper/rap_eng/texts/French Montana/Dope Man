[Hook: Bigga Threat]
I got that diddy on the scale, that hova in the rice
Hip hop dope man
Get you styles nice price
That little Nasty Nas
That Redman stealing cars
That Jada and the micro
Whippin up a light show
Dope mannn da hip hop dope man (I got what you need)
Dope man da hip hop dope man (we got all that ya need)

[Verse 1: French Montana]
Got you saying HUUUUH, when that check clear
Plus my ring, wrist and neck clear
And my niggas high, it's like exercise
Stick up, sit ups, dog food, Syrup
New Ferrari swerve, Harley pickup
Block calls I don't pick up
It's hydro snuck through the side do'
Bang bang 5. 0 help you hit the high note
Pressing buttons on the microwave, aqua wave
Young boy cook it up, serve it up right away
Money spit, gotta make it back
Bring it back gotta me sayin huh
When them doors open
Got cha friends mouth and legs open
Mazzarati fox, Heckler and Hoch
And my niggas near holes and the liquor clear
Dope brown, coke white
Weed blue, jewelry see-thru
It's the dope man, call me if you need to

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Bigga Threat]
I got that Diddy on the scale
That Hova on the rice
Hip hop dope man get you styles nice price
Digital mic right
Living loud life trife
50 thou and white ice
From 50 cent and my knife
I'm a grinda I'mma schemer, I'm a Russel
You a dreamer
I'mma cutter, you a bleeder
Don't trust you bitches either
Hustla diva Foxy, little Eve a man
From the grain get ya bucks
Out the game
Put em up and distain refrain
From the rain
The glitter and the glammer
The killers and the hammers
The dealers and the scammers
The slickers and the bamas
Give thanks how ya day go
For the banks and the yay yo
The kiss and the payroll
Big bro bae bro
Cain and the able
The yay and fable
The weak and the feeble
Perish wit ya people
Pushing sour diesel
Pistols Desert Eagle
No reason to mislead you
No reason enough to leave you
Ya undercovers see through
Hip hop cops can bleed too

[Verse 3: Donny Goines]

Hip Hop, dopeman, distributing to Lohan
Lindsey, Kim K, Amber sick beats
Y'all betta get with the program
My sixteens, that thick lean, he flow, kilos
Them Coke Boyz and you know Goines
Lost my sense, I got no coins
Blow bands like is no manyana
CEO of the Streets; no, CEO of the Corner Office
Corporate and I get my dollars
Wave Gang/Ink Different
Signing checks like it's payday, no I mean nuts like Payday
Goons on deck nigga bang bang
Ya strip dried up like AA
Continental, globetrotting, no basketball, stovetopping
You Dockers, slacking off, I never nap at all
No three Z's, till I decease, nigga please

[Outro: Jetta B]
