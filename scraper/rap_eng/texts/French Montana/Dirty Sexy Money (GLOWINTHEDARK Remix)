[Verse 1: Charli XCX]
Woah, woooh [x7]
I want you bad, want you bad, want you bad
Saw you in the moonlight
Think you lookin' fine, want you bad
Got me good, never turn back (oooh)
I make you mine, make you mine, make you mine
Coming for the taking, promise you are wearing the crown
Number one, spin your head around

[Pre-Chorus: Charli XCX]
Woooh, tell me what you want and I can do it to you
I'm a million dollars, make your wishes come true
Calling out you're, calling out, calling out you're
Never seen a girl like this before

[Chorus: Charli XCX]
If you wanna pu-pu-pu-pu-put it on me
You're not gonna ge-ge-ge-ge-get it for free
Come on spend that dirty sexy money on me, on me, on me
You got to pull up, pull up

All I want is...
Dirty sex, dirty sex, dirty sex, dirty sex, dirty, dirty sex
Dirty sex, dirty sex, dirty sexy
All I want is...
Dirty sex, dirty sex, dirty sex, dirty sex, dirty, dirty sex
Baby, baby, move your body
On me, on me (sex), on me, on me
Right now (sex)
You got to pull up, pull up, pull up

[Verse 2: French Montana]
Louis shoes, cop boots, top down, you
Diamond juice, all I see is you, right now, you
All I want is you, you
Tunnel vision, you, you
All I need is you, I'ma put it on you (you)

[Chorus: Charli XCX]
If you wanna pu-pu-pu-pu-put it on me
You're not gonna ge-ge-ge-ge-get it for free
Come on spend that dirty sexy money on me, on me, on me
You got to pull up, pull up, pull up, pull up
If you wanna do-do-do-do-do it freaky
24/7, no-no-no-no-no sleep
Come on put that dirty sexy money on me, on me, on me
You got to pull up, pull up

All I want is...
Dirty sex, dirty sex, dirty sex, dirty sex, dirty, dirty sex
Dirty sex, dirty sex, dirty sexy
All I want is...
Dirty sex, dirty sex, dirty sex, dirty sex, dirty, dirty sex
Baby, baby, move your body
On me, on me (sex), on me, on me
Right now (sex)
You got to baby, baby, move your body
Dirty sex, dirty sex, dirty sex, dirty sex, dirty, dirty sex
Dirty sex, dirty sex, dirty sexy
On me, on me (sex), on me, on me
All I want is pull up, pull up, pull up

[Outro: Charli XCX]
If you wanna
Pull up, pull up (all I want is)
Pull up (if you wanna)
Pull up, pull up (all I want is)
