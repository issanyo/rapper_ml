[Verse 1]
I hope no one discovers you
Hope no one sees her
I hope no one falls in love with you
I've got my reasons
'Cause if they knew what I know then I know I wouldn't stand a chance
There's no way you would go for a man like me if you had options

[Chorus]
Even though the world was meant for you
I hope you don't get famous
'Cause everyone will love you but won't love you like I do, oh nah
Hope you don't get famous
Stay home with me
Stay home with me
I'll always love ya, I'll always
Hope you don't get
Hope you don't get famous
Hope you don't get famous
Hope you don't get famous
Hope you don't get famous
Yeah

[Verse 2]
Baby live your life, just how you are
Shining star
Hope you never get famous
Flying low with the angels
They said "fake it 'till you make it"
I guess you fake when you make it
I told you "stick to the basics"
Built an empire started from the basement
If you tryna fix a glass that's broken
You know it might cut ya hand
Never want to see you with another man
Truth might eat you if you're mumbling
When it get too cold for a blanket
Need you hugging me
Because nobody gonna love you like I do

[Chorus]
Even though the world was meant for you
I hope you don't get famous
'Cause everyone will love you but won't love you like the way I do, oh nah
Hope you don't get famous
Stay home with me
Stay home with me
I'll always love ya, I'll always
Hope you don't get
Hope you don't get famous
Hope you don't get famous
Hope you don't get famous
Hope you don't get famous
Yeah

[Bridge]
All day long I stand by you
Right or wrong I stand by you
Keep me strong, oh girl it's true
Keep me strong, oh girl it's true

[Chorus]
Even though the world was meant for you
I hope you don't get famous
'Cause everyone will love you but won't love you like  I do, oh nah
Hope you don't get famous
Stay home with me
Stay home with me
I'll always love ya, I'll always
Hope you don't get
Hope you don't get famous
Hope you don't get famous
Hope you don't get famous
Hope you don't get famous
Yeah
