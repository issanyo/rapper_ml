[Chorus]
I pray to God I ain't ever dying broke
If I ever owe you, you ain't ever going broke
Everything you seen been the realist shit you saw
What the business is keep minds on Allah
Devil want my soul, Bitches turn me cold
Bottle after bottle watching bitches on a pole
Promise never fold, Money never fold
Gettin money fast, watchin niggas dying slow
I pray to God I ain't ever dying broke
If I ever owe you, you ain't ever going broke
Everything you seen been the realist shit you saw
What the business is keep minds on Allah
Devil want my soul, Bitches turn me cold
Bottle after bottle watching bitches on a pole
Promise never fold, Money never fold
Gettin money fast, watchin niggas dying slow

[Verse 1]
Whippin on that stove
Hoppin out that ghost
With a hundred chains on this industry is cold
Fuck them niggas told
Everything we sold
Made it out the corner, I'm fifty racks a show
Whippin on that stove
Got my money grown money
Orders to my brother, ice got em all hung
Hustle in my bones
Better watch your tone
Niggas catch your life just for talkin on that phone
We get it on our own
Now everythin we own
Tell em stop smalls talkin, all my money grown
Mansion on my arm
Coke boy talk
Made it out the bottom, out the bottom like I told em

[Chorus]
I pray to God I ain't ever dying broke
If I ever owe you, you ain't ever going broke
Everything you seen been the realist shit you saw
What the business is keep minds on Allah
Devil want my soul, Bitches turn me cold
Bottle after bottle watching bitches on a pole
Promise never fold, Money never fold
Gettin money fast, watchin niggas dying slow
I pray to God I ain't ever dying broke
If I ever owe you, you ain't ever going broke
Everything you seen been the realist shit you saw
What the business is keep minds on Allah
Devil want my soul, Bitches turn me cold
Bottle after bottle watching bitches on a pole
Promise never fold, Money never fold
Gettin money fast, watchin niggas dying slow

[Verse 2]
Promise never fold (aah)
And my money never fold (aah)
Made it to the top like I told em (aah)
Let em keep talkin I'mma show em (aah)
That I'mma bring to any nigga that want it-
Ooh devil wants my soul
Self made millionaire! no nigga I owe
Made it out that hole, now watch a nigga ball
24 chains, 24k gold
High School to the Pros, ballin like Lebron
Hood got young niggas stressing, going bald
Came up I was poor, now Ros√© I pour
And I ain't scared of shit just a nigga dying broke

[Chorus]
I pray to God I ain't ever dying broke
If I ever owe you, you ain't ever going broke
Everything you seen been the realist shit you saw
What the business is keep minds on Allah
Devil want my soul, Bitches turn me cold
Bottle after bottle watching bitches on a pole
Promise never fold, Money never fold
Gettin money fast, watchin niggas dying slow
I pray to God I ain't ever dying broke
If I ever owe you, you ain't ever going broke
Everything you seen been the realist shit you saw
What the business is keep minds on Allah
Devil want my soul, Bitches turn me cold
Bottle after bottle watching bitches on a pole
Promise never fold, Money never fold
Gettin money fast, watchin niggas dying slow
