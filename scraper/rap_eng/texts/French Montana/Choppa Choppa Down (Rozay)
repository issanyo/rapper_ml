Choppa choppa down
I lay that nigga down (down, down, down, down)
Choppa choppa break it down (down, down, down, down)
I lay that nigga down (down, down, down, down)
Choppa choppa break it down (down, down, down, down)
I lay that nigga down (down, down, down, down)
Choppa choppa break it down (down, down, down, down)
I lay that nigga down (down, down, down, down)

[Rick Ross]
I call my chopper my whopper
You get it just like you want it
Get in bed with a gangster fuckin' over petty opponents
I knee deep in the game, I done perfected my moves
I'm still moving them thangs chillin' perfection Zeus
These niggas like when I walk
God forgives, and I don't
For this money I'm chasin' I put yo ass in my trunk
So fuck these Hip-Hop sites
My dawgs rich off white
My jewels drip like Ice
Now suck my dick all night

[Hook]

[French Montana]
Shots be flying, niggas die, don't make a sound
Cold 44 in slow mo' when your body hit the ground, ground
Nigga look around, got shooters got guns got bitches got white
Motherfucker we run the town, when them shots be flying
Niggas diving dyin, running trying to hit the ground
Security need security when them shots be flying around
Cocaine music, not stopping that
We juiced with jewels I'm project pat?
I got the streets niggas, fine with that
Chasing that money never stopping that
With a big ass chopper, cocaine mafia
Lay a nigga down if a nigga try to stop it
Choppa break it dowm, I fix a nigga proper
Low to the ground in a roof no top
King of the street, I ain't never go stop
Niggas ask around "when the shit gonna drop? "
Nigga so hot, jewels so cold
Still let a choppa choppa down!

[Hook]

[Wiz Khalifa]
Smoking while I'm raping, yeaaa, hahaha
Means I'm higher than you

Rep this gang bitch, I'm a roll this plane bitch
You talking anguish but money that's my language
New car, new ho, even got a new main bitch
Can't call, new phone, but I'm still on that same shit
Bossin' cause I came into this game without a boss
Humm and I'm eating good so I just gotta floss
And and and I spent your advance just on my Audemar
I'm here today then I'm gone tomorrow
Can't find a pound cause I bought em and break em down

[Hook]
