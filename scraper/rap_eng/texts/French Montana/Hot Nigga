[French Montana]
Made my first mil, start tweaking, ho
Tell my old bitch, I ain't speaking, ho
Montana, I'm a block nigga
Heard they shot me, and I shot niggas
Young Hov, boss of the Roc, nigga
Three bricks for a verse, that's a swap, nigga
Shout my nigga Meek, he on lock, nigga
Shout my nigga Max, he in a box, nigga
Pull up La Marina in a yacht, nigga
Skate off like a pirate with your thot, nigga
Ya heard, she's a freaky ho
Bitch ain't loyal, she fucked Breezy, ho
Believe me, you can ask Weezy, ho
I heard she fucked Puff like a week ago
But I still want the pussy, though
I'ma Shmurda dance on the pussy, ho
That bitch ass full of bullet holes
Still paid couple grands for that pussy, ho
I'ma Shmurda dance on the pussy, ho
I'ma Shmurda dance on the pussy, ho
I'ma Shmurda dance on the pussy, ho
I'ma Shmurda dance on the pussy, ho

[Bobby Shmurda's original verse follows]
