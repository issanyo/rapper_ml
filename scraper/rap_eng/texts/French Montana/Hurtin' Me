[Intro: Stefflon Don & French Montana]
Oh, I see you, see, I see, yeah
Montana
Stefflon Don
Know what it is when you hear that

[Verse 1: Stefflon Don]
Breakfast in bed darling
I got your bed falling
I make you beg for it
I make you beg for it
Breakfast in bed darling
I got your bed falling
I made mistakes, you done me wrong
But now you leave me calling

[Pre-Chorus: Stefflon Don]
Hmm-mmm-mmm
Oh, oh, oh

[Chorus: Stefflon Don]
I heard you got a new girlfriend
And it's hurtin' me
I heard you got a new girlfriend
And it's hurtin'
Yeah, it's hurtin'
Yeah, it's hurtin' me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me
Me, me, me, me, me
Yeah, it's hurtin' me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me
Me, me, me, me, me

[Verse 2: Stefflon Don]
Tears down my face fallin'
I'm in the place bawlin'
If I ever find her, find her, find her
I'm sendin' shots, I'm sendin' shots
I don't know why you stallin'
Can you give me signs, can you please call me?
Baby, you rewinding it all on me
Baby, give me time, beg you love, love me

[Pre-Chorus: Stefflon Don]
Hmm-mmm-mmm
Oh, oh, oh

[Chorus: Stefflon Don & (French Montana)]
I heard you got a new girlfriend
And it's hurtin' me
I heard you got a new girlfriend
And it's hurtin'
Yeah, it's hurtin'
Yeah, it's hurtin' me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me
Me, me, me, me, me (Montana)
Yeah, it's hurtin' me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me
Me, me, me, me, me (Don)

[Verse 3: French Montana]
What you know about goin' out, big jet, big check
Don't care, die for my respect
Life, we gon' live it up
Neck, we don't give it up
Dice, get, get 'em, girl, gon' bet it up
Grind and invest it
Invest like the main role not the ex shit
X-rate movies like Netflix
Never domestic, watchin' her necklace
Young and restless, you know who the best is
Three-quarter, Gucci Mane with the fur shoe
I got a girl, and my girl got a girl too
Hit me with the fab like put it in the bag
Pull up on my new ting, like I knew she mad

[Chorus: Stefflon Don & French Montana]
I heard you got a new girlfriend
And it's hurtin' me
I heard you got a new girlfriend
And it's hurtin'
Yeah, it's hurtin'
Yeah, it's hurtin' me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me
Me, me, me, me, me

[Outro: Stefflon Don]
And I cry, I cry, even my eye cry
But who cares?
Who cares?
And I cry, I cry, even my eye cry
But who cares?
Who cares?
