(Prince Pronto Cover)

[Intro]
Mmmmm
Aye
Yeah, Prince

[Verse 1]
Breakfast in bed darling
You got my bed falling
You made me beg for it
You made me beg for it
Breakfast in bed darling
You got my bed falling
You made mistakes, I done you wrong
Now I heard you calling

[Pre-Chorus]
Mmm-mmm-mmm
Oou, oou, oou

[Chorus]
You know I got a new girlfriend
And it’s hurting you
Yeah, Aye!
You know I got a new girlfriend
And it's hurtin'
Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, yeah it's hurtin'
You babe..
Hurtin’ you.. babe
Say you you you
I know it’s hurtin’
Hurtin’!
You you you you you
Hurtin’ you, you
You you you babe
Hurtin’
Say you you you you you you
You you you babe

Hurtin’ you babe

You, you, you, you, you
Yeah, it's hurtin' you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you
You, you, you, you

[Verse B]
I still thank God for yuh
Yeah I stay praying for yuh
But I’m done playing now
You need more simple now
Saw you on a plane going different places
Fall in love with the different faces
Two different lives
Live your life
I’ll live mine
I spend my time in studio as usual
You know?
And compromise is music then her
And she knows..
We make music together
And that is the key the answer
I want us to build empires
I wish it was you
Wish it was you too

[Pre-Chorus]
Mmm-mmm-mmm
Oou, oou, oou

[Chorus]
You know I got a new girlfriend
And it’s hurting you
Yeah, Aye!
You know I got a new girlfriend
And it's hurtin'
Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, yeah it's hurtin'
You babe..
Hurtin’ you.. babe
Hurtin’ you!
Say you you you
I know it’s hurtin’
Hurtin’!
You you you you you
Hurtin’ you, you
You you you babe
Hurtin’
Say you you you you you you
You you you babe
