[Chorus: French Montana]
You thought it was high, we just gettin' started
You thought it was paid, we just gettin' started
Man, them niggas down, we just gettin' started
Bring a hundred bottles, we just gettin' started
Gettin' started, we just gettin' started
You thought it was high, we just gettin' started
Gettin' started, we just gettin' started
You thought it was faded, we just gettin' started
