(I'm so) Montana (I'm so)
Cocaine (I'm so) uh
We bid in the game, once again
I'm so special, Oooh
You know we luv ya luv ya luv ya long time
Montana (Montana) Oooh
You know we luv ya luv ya luv ya long time
Oooh

Big 4-4, no safety
You'll collapse like JoJo, K-Ci
And my ice like lights from AC
Homie I'm hot like a drop, no AC
They wanna freestyle, I'm tryna stay free
And my crew, all blue like Grape Street
From 8 blocks, I take shots, HD
I'll blast, you'll dash like Stacey
But look ock, I can't stop, I'm waist-deep
Fuck crossin' over, I'm a stay street
Nigga I'm good, I been what the hood made me
I got guns, 7 inches to 8 feet
You ain't Pac, you ain't Fif', you ain't Jay-Z
You ain't Yay', you ain't French, you ain't wavy
For my coke boys, shoot a nigga face off
In the bookings, can make me take my lace off
And my belt, and the voucher for my cake, boss
You know I'm on top of beef like steak sauce
A1, since day one, I caked off
Still slang that 'caine and that haze dog
It's a new religion, my jeans, True Religion
Homie scramble with notes, I'm New Edition
Got that hefty garbage bread
I'm in the backseat gettin' that Harvard head
Aiyy, swaggalicious, with' a bag of bitches
This food for thought, and they got the dishes
They gon' clean the pots, the coke residue
This that crack cocaine for you to listen to

We bid in the game, once again
I'm so special, Oooh
You know we luv ya luv ya luv ya long time
