-HOOK-
Girl I use to love you
Now you with a nigga who just wanna fuck you
Now you with a nigga who just wanna use you
I know you still think about me when he touches you

-Bridge-
I bet he don’t treat you like I use too
I bet he don’t love you like I use too
I bet he don’t beat it up like I use too
Baby konsa, konsa,

-Verse-
He the type to fuck you and leave you
The type to say he love you but he dont love you
He don't love you, he he don't trust
When you blowing up his phone he ignore you

Girl, I know your feeling hopeless, it hard to focus
I notice, he doing you bogus like Peter with Lois
I notice, how you holdin, girl your stupid
You thought that nigga was Moses but he ain’t open

I can tell your broken, your heart been stolen
Lost in the ocean, no motion while floating
Feelings loading, while your heart closing
Overdosing, No words can explain how much you are hurting

-Bridge-
I bet he don’t treat you like I use too
I bet he don’t love you like I use too
I bet he don’t beat it up like I use too
Baby konsa, konsa

-Verse-
Girl I know you tink about you and I
The freaky ting we use to do every night
Grab that ass, throw your panties to the side
Get on top vroom vroom you ride

Vroom Vroom you ride
Get on top baby vroom vroom you ride
Grab that ass, throw dem panties to the side
The freaky ting we use to do every night

-HOOK-
Girl I use to love you
Now you with a nigga who just wanna fuck you
Now you with a nigga who just wanna use you
I know you still think about me when he touches you

-Bridge-
I bet he don’t treat you like I use too
I bet he don’t love you like I use too
I bet he don’t beat it up like I use too
Baby konsa, konsa

-HOOK-
Girl I use to love you
Now you with a nigga who just wanna fuck you
Now you with a nigga who just wanna use you
I know you still think about me when he touches you


-Outro-
When he touches you (When touches you)
When he touches you
(I know you still think about me)
When he touches you (When he touches you)
(ya ya)
When he touches you (ya)
When he touches you (when he touches you)
When he touches you
I know you still think about me, when he touches you
(When he touches you)
I still you still think about me
