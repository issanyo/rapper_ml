[Verse 1: Brianna Perry]
Got got no haters inside
I post the love pitch your damn looking on my lights
Wait till I get them beans, wait I love that light
They they don’t think I breathe basketball and bouncing all night
See them guns better tipple, you think your bitch call
But I got all the siblings
Bitch like I got all my Christians like chairs in the church
This is my true religion like pens on my butt
They pray for my fall but I didn’t wanna turn up
I didn’t wanna turn up, make rin like some turn up

My grandma on medicate, my mama need them bills paid
I’m tryin to keep my hale lay, my hale lay

You gonna see me in that..
That white, on white, on white, alright alright alright
Will you see me, alright alright alright
Bitches wanna beat me, alright alright alright
