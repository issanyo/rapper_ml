Look at all the money I made
Look at all the money I made
Look at all the money I made
Look at all the money I made
Look at all the money I made
Look at all the money I made
Look at all the money I made
Look at all the money I made
I make money every day
Young nigga came a long way
I ain't make the game my play
Look at all the money I made
Look at all the money I made
Look at all the money I made
Look at all the money I made

[Verse 1: French Montana]
Look at all the money I made
Arenas we play, bitches we slayed
When I call lick, all my niggas got paid
Make 10 million off Puff, got paid
Ship came in, my city got paid
Drop straight cash on you i8
Top down smoking Californ-I-A
Straight to the top now, nigga why wait?
Dropping bags in the bowl in the water, got bag ties, dirty water
You know I'ma rob him with a bitch like Paula
Now I'm trying to make 10 mill in a quarter
Chevy wide open in the islands
Riding through the city like a foreigner
I know niggas mad but niggas can't hate

[Hook: K Camp]
Look at all the money I made
Look at all the money I made
Look at all the money I made
Look at all the money I made
Look at all the money I made
Look at all the money I made
Look at all the money I made
Look at all the money I made
I make money every day
Young nigga came a long way
I ain't make the game my play
Look at all the money I made
Look at all the money I made
Look at all the money I made
Look at all the money I made

[Verse 2: K Camp]
Used to pull up in the four door Honda
With my nigga Yayo with the black door
Met the lil bitch, I can tell she will run the next night
I was sneaking through the back door
I done crown up, I don't fuck with the goose
No more but I still sip the yak though
Whole team tryna eat like a fat ho
If it ain't money I don't even react though
Henny to the brim got my vision too blurry
You know I keep three like my name Steph Curry
Sonnin' these niggas like an episode of Murry
If you running for the money, motherfuckers better hurry
Shout out Diego, stacking like Legos
I got a bitch that's gon' go when I say so
I got a bitch that's gon' fuck when I say so
I pass her to Genius, he tell her to lay low

Look at all the money I made
Look at all the money I made
Look at all the money I made
Look at all the money I made
Look at all the money I made
Look at all the money I made
Look at all the money I made
Look at all the money I made
I make money every day, young nigga came a long way
I ain't make the game my play
Look at all the money I made
Look at all the money I made
Look at all the money I made
Look at all the money I made
