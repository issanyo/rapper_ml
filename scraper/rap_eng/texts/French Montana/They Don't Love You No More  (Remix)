[Intro: Remy Ma]
You ain’t got love for me, my nigga?
You ain’t got love for me, my nigga?
(We the best music)
I'm back, yeah
(Remix)
Ever since your chick hit the top
Know your bitch is mad, Remy out the box
(They don’t love you no more)
You don’t love me no more?
She the best
(DJ Khaled)

[Verse 1: Remy Ma]
When y’all was on the TV I was with the PV’s
I listened to your CD, damn, you really wanna be me
Don't care if your name buzzin’, you know who the queen be
Dello Russo did you lasik, bitches still can’t see me
These rap chicks try to stay away from me
Maybe ‘cause I caught that case, they afraid of me
Rem got that flow, spit it crazily
And it’s a fact I’m everything they portray to be
Nevermind  how long been down, y’all know how I give it up
Fuckin’ a player in Milwaukee, y'all know I keep it a buck
Probably should have been a nun, y’all know I don’t give a fuck
My lips ain't big for nothing , on the right night might could get it sucked
Give it to her in the tummy, y’all know that I keep it tucked
Claim she fly and got a bill, to me that sound like she a duck
I’mma take these bitches job and get them worked like Loaded Lux
On my Cali swag, black Raiders cap and a pair of Chucks
Bad bitches rolling with me and a couple model mutts
Used to have some flab on ‘em, but they put it in they butts
Yeah they call me Scarface, a bitch still cute as fuck
Some call me dollface, some niggas wanna kiss my crotch

[Hook: French Montana (Remy Ma)]
Ever since a nigga hit the top (yeah)
Pussy niggas wanna see me in a box
They don't love you no more (y’all don’t love me no more?)
They don't love you no more, yeah
Troops gotta cock (uh huh) coupe's gotta drop (yeah)
Shit starting to change so you starting to change, ah
They don't love you no more (they don’t love me no more?)
They don't love you no more (they don’t love me no more?
Should be your favorite, now you're just hatin'
Shit starting to change, you want me to change, nah
They don't love you no more (they don't love me no more?)
They don't love you no more, nah (they don’t love me no more?)

[Verse 2: Remy Ma]
Okay, I’ve been gone for over half a decade
Don’t tell me all y’all done fell for these hoes facade
I mean façade, they garbage, discard them
These hoes is pussy, I discharge ‘em
They don’t even get my dick hardened
I heat a bitch up, Miami, Chris Bosh ‘em
Microwave ‘em, see all my fans waving
The flow water juice drippin’, the girl so wavy
They say the girl crazy, really can’t blame ‘em
They blow dick, I blow torch, just flame ‘em
Hoes so lame and ain’t no taming Rem
I flip quick, no gymnasium
You don’t got no balls, just a big cranium
Shoot me down, I won’t fall, iron titanium
I’m telling chicks ain’t no touching me
I’m celibate, nobody can't fuck with me
Some say she nice, but Reminisce nicer
I can feel the tension, please don't hype her
Tell her stay in her lane before I side swipe her
Droppin’ that bird shit ,I'd hate to windshield wiper
Been violating before I land on Rikers
Ain’t shit change like a baby dirty diaper
I don’t love these hoes, never even liked her
Remy Makavelli, send shots through bellies
Come through in a pair of Breds and a peanut butter Pelle
These fucking fruits is sweeter than grape jelly
Softer than R&B, ma’, you aren’t me
You pop like coochie, I really R-A-P

[Outro]
You ain’t got love for me my nigga?
You ain’t got love for me nigga?
Yo, Khaled
(I change your life)
