[Skit: JAY-Z]
People look at you strange, sayin' you changed
Like you worked that hard to stay the same
Like you doin' all this for a reason
And what happens most of the time people change
People change around you because
They startin' treatin' you different because of your success

[Intro: DJ Khaled]
We The Best Music
(Zombie on the track)
Another one

[Bridge: French Montana & DJ Khaled]
Ever since a nigga hit the top (uh)
Pussy niggas wanna see me in a box (oh)
They don't love you no more
They don't love me no more
They don't love you no more
DJ Khaled!

[Verse 1: Meek Mill]
Shit ain't been the same since I came through in that hot shit
They gon' talk about you 'til you ain't got shit
Still gon' talk about you when you got shit
All eyes on Meek, I'm on my Pac shit
Y'all rap niggas on some pop shit
I've been duckin' paparazzi with a pop bitch
Glock .30 in the cockpit
Sippin' dirty, conversatin' with the pilot
Nigga, you ain't seen it, I've been fuckin' up arenas
I'm with double M, the genius
We the motherfuckin' meanest
And the cleanest in a long time
You pussy niggas hatin' on me picked the wrong time
Long line for a limp mink draggin', new bandwagon
Blood drippin' on me lookin' like a nigga stabbed him
I be on the money, bakin' soda in the cabinet
Pyrex, tryna whip a Rollie, makin' magic
Laughin' at you fuck niggas gettin' madder
If I feel threatened, I'ma go and get a ladder
And climb up your chest, nigga
Motherfuck your vest, nigga
Motherfuck your couch, I'm with Khaled, the best, nigga

[Hook: French Montana]
Ever since a nigga hit the top (uh)
Pussy niggas wanna see me in a box (oh)
They don't love you no more (they don't love you no more)
They don't love you no more, hey
Jewels gotta cop, coupes gotta drop
Shit startin' to change, so you startin' to change, nah
They don't love you no more (they don't love you no more)
They don't love you no more, nah
Should be your favorite, now you're just hatin'
Shit startin' to change, you want me to change, nah
They don't love you no more (they don't love you no more)
They don't love you no more, nah

[Verse 2: Rick Ross]
Bullet in the head, they wanna see my shirt red
Live by the code, it's the only way to play it
Benz or the Rolls, Mulsanne overrated
Half these niggas told, cut a deal, they'd take it
Promise to never fold and the bonds still sacred
Had to shake a couple niggas, everybody won't make it
God is the greatest as I'm prayin' in the latest
X600 as I swerve, Little Haiti
Ou paka bat m'wen, sak pase!
I'm bustin' out the sunroof, nigga, ¡andalé!
My money always comin', no, I'm never on pause
They bring it straight to your door if you a mothafuckin' boss
Let's ride

[Hook: French Montana]
Ever since a nigga hit the top (uh)
Pussy niggas wanna see me in a box (oh)
They don't love you no more (they don't love you no more)
They don't love you no more, hey
Jewels gotta cop, coupes gotta drop
Shit startin' to change, so you startin' to change, nah
They don't love you no more (they don't love you no more)
They don't love you no more, nah
Should be your favorite, now you're just hatin'
Shit startin' to change, you want me to change, nah
They don't love you no more (they don't love you no more)
They don't love you no more, nah

[Verse 3: JAY-Z]
Hol' up, you ain't got love for me, my nigga?
Ever meet another nigga like me, my nigga?
Are you sure? A nigga flip this shit like Jarl Borg
A nigga did this shit, this hardcore
If you say it, guess it's true though, kudos, I mean but who knows?
Salute to all the real niggas out there findin' the loopholes
Fuck all these fuck niggas, hate when niggas come up, igh!
Hopped off the plane, hit the helicopter (igh!)
Tell these crabs in the barrel we eatin' hella lobster (igh!)
Got hella options, like a college team
Hit these bootleg niggas with the Heisman
Fuck the NCAA, nigga!
Let a young nigga get paid, nigga!
Niggas talkin' down on the crown
Watch them niggas you 'round got you wound
Haters wanna ball, let me tighten up my draw string
Wrong sport, boy, you know you soft as a lacrosse team
RRRAAAAHHH!

[Hook: French Montana]
Ever since a nigga hit the top (uh)

They don't love you no more (they don't love you no more)
They don't love you no more, hey
Jewels gotta cop, coupes gotta drop
Shit startin' to change, so you startin' to change, nah
They don't love you no more (they don't love you no more)
They don't love you no more, nah
Should be your favorite, now you're just hatin'
Shit startin' to change, you want me to change, nah
They don't love you no more (they don't love you no more)
They don't love you no more, nah

[Outro: DJ Khaled]
You don't love me no more?!
All the shit I done for you
You don't love me no more?!
