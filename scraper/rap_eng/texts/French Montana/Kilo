[Intro: DJ Scream]
The Untouchable Maybach Music Group
(Yeah, we was really sellin' that powder, nigga)
This a gift to the street accept that with honor

[Hook 1: Louie V Gutta]
I used to pray to get a kilo, a kilo
36 O's up that route for my amigo
Throw it in that water, watch it swim like Nemo
Man I swear to God I pray to get a kilo

[Hook 2: Louie V Gutta]
Then I got a kilo, a kilo
Better keep that on the low if you got them kilos
You might get booked or get murdered for that kilo
Now I’m steady getting money and this ho wanna fuck
Cause she know I got a kilo, she only want me cause I got bricks
She only want me when I got bricks
Before a nigga, I ain’t had shit
She only want me cause I got kilos

[Verse 1: Meek Mill]
Kilos all on my neck, these niggas ain’t no threat
Sky Dweller gold our plane, and I ain’t comin in no jet
And all I want is straight cash, I ain’t even takin' no checks
Cause these hoes don't do credit
And they don’t pop pussy if the money on debit
I got them kilos - she only want me cause I got bricks
She only want me cause I got shit
Before a nigga ain’t have shit
Man she only want me cause I got kilos
36 O's in the pyrex, I be going HAM in the projects
Got a bad bitch with me and she all that
She ain’t nothing but a jump shot, all net (swish)
Ya'll suckers play foul like Artest
I make a brand new flow, you can borrow that
Selling all these bricks, need a hard hat
I hit your ho one time, never call back
Say these niggas used to wanna be like Mike
Now these niggas wanna be like me
And these hoes twerkin' on Instagram
Still talkin like they wanna be like B
And these dudes y'all say getting money
Lookin' like groupies in the VIP
And if these dudes got all this paper
Cause all these niggas wanna be like me, ho!

[Hook 1: Louie V Gutta]

[Verse 3: French Montana]
HAH! HAH! Ay, ay, ay, ay
You ain’t got enough on me nigga, 44’s tucked on me nigga
Long nose like Ginobili nigga, 5 rings like Kobe nigga (bling!)
I was flippin kilo after kilo (after kilo)
Rockin that Versace shit way before Migos
Started with them grams at the project with a stack
Then I flipped it to a brick and then I did the Project Pat
Like, homie what’s the problem? Semi or revolver
Catch a nigga with the bricks, you know we goin' rob em
Once I caught the liquor we was fresh up out the drop
Man the bitches on the corner watch a player like the scout
I said all I wanted was a kilo, all them bitches wanna free load
All I wanted was a drop with the head cracked like Cee Lo
36 them O’s nigga, thousand grams on gold nigga
Power plants at the broke nigga, BC, coke boys nigga
Army come, pistol on me, smoking on California
10 chains, catch pneumonia, yea

[Bridge 2: Yo Gotti]
Ain’t no refunds nigga
Wanna get your money back? Best bring your guns nigga
Ain't no receipts in the streets, all sales, you know they final nigga
So if you lose some then it’s your loss
If you don’t way up then scale off, if you trap right it’ll pay off
