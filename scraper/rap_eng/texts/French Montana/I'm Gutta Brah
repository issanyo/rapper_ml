[Verse 1: Juicy J]

At the corner store, trying to sell some weed
Dat chrome 44, it sting like a bee
It'l burn yo ass, for fucking with me
Nigga jack my trap house

Nigga think this guttah? Nigga we gon see
Jump out the [?]
Give me my cheese, nigga give me my dough

Two of their back, I killed them hoes
Niggas ain't going to jail no more

[Hook: Juicy J]

[Verse 3: Project Pat]
Westside of Tennessee
Blunt full of reggie B
Pump right up under the seat
Cranberry in the sea

Keep them mouth on, Keep them tongue full of woes
Nigga you dont know me
Now he wanna merk me over one of his hoes
Why can't we just keep it hood
Child support, dodgin court

A fifth of yak
Don't play with me
