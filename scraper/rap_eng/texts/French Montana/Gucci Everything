[Verse 1: Red Cafe]
Look, realest, realest, realest nigga living, fuck a nigga feelings
I woke up this morning, hit the block and made a killin'
Them ladies, y'all love it, my niggas be plugging
Graduated college mama but I chose thuggin' (what up)
We got all the money, if y'all was looking for it

Wearin all this jewelry exciting the federalies
All this Cavalli, Versace, and Gucci everything
I know I'm shallow but fuck it (Gucci, Gucci everything)
