[Intro: Sample]
Words came to me that I wrote on the back of my boarding pass
Words for you
I called to you, you passed me by
Singing long goodbyes made you cry
I went away again to play a show
What I had to say, you'll never know
So I caught my plane and I hit the sky
30 thousand feet, yeah up so high
I'm lonely as I'm sitting here watching the clouds go by
The song is just a star
To make up for all the time we've been apart
And all it has to say
Is what I tried to say today

[Hook]
Gon' bust it wide, get me in the mood
Still gettin' high with the same old crew
Gon' bend it over from the back and make it talk
We ain't gotta put a title on to play your part
Real niggas back in style
Real bitches back in style
Real niggas back in style
She gon' put it in, was the sweetest thing she ever said
"Hit it from the back" was the sweetest thing she ever said
Gon' bend it over, baby, gon' make it talk
We ain't gotta put a title on to play your part

[Verse 1]
Baby I always come back for you
Baby I always come back for you
She don't like R&B, she like a thug
Every time goin' deep, she fall in love
On the island, Dominican rum
Bend it over from the back 'til your leg get numb
Baby, forever be my lady
Twisted off the Yac and the purp, Montana been waitin'
If I ever came in your mouth without tellin' yah, my fault
Baby gon' bend down, hit the bottom, don't talk
Baby please, got the same friends, enemies

[Hook]

[Outro]
Real niggas back in style
Real bitches back in style
Real niggas back in style
Real bitches back in style
