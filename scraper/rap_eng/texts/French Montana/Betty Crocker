Sierra leone all up in the link
Ten stack on piranhas all up in the tank
Ten zero's all comas all up in the bank
And Keep ten stacks in the crib just in case I wanna play
Uh 40 piece knock a braid off, that ain't even a lease cause I'm paid off
I'm in the game you talking from the sideline

Rookie of the year, high school to the league

Whip it flip hundred clip its that banana thing fresh off the ship
