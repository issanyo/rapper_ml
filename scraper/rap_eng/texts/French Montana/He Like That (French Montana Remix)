[Intro: Ally & Normani]
Mmm...
Pumps and a bump, pumps and a bump

[Verse 1: Dinah]
You got that good boy attitude and yeah, I kinda like it
You got the tats on your arm, got a bad girl excited
You put that bass in the beat, won't you beat it up inside it?
I got that pumps and a bump and you know you wanna try it

[Pre-Chorus: Normani]
Pumps and a bump, pumps and a bump
He like the girls with the pumps and a bump
Pumps and a bump, pumps and a bump
I be that girl with the pumps and a bump

[Chorus: Lauren & Normani & (French Montana)]
He like that bang, bang, bang
He like that bomb, bomb, bomb
He like that love, love, love
I'm like that drug, drug, drug
He trip when he on it, one taste and he want it
He like that bang, bang, bang
He like that bomb, bomb, bomb
He like that love, love, love
I'm like that drug, drug, drug
He trip when he on it, one taste and he want it
(Montana, you know what it is when you hear that haaa)

[Verse 2: French Montana]
Bang, bang, bang, bang
Hold up, rang rang, go watch chain gang
My story change lanes (skrrt skrrt)
Bring four girls, I'm up for a challenge (skrrt skrrt)
French vanilla, keep your balance
I lost my check and time, my flight lands at nine
Your flight lands at eight, my game just rewind
She love them dope boys, I love them big booties
Hurricane, strip clubs, and keep your wrist stupid
Bright lights, can't lose 'em, white man, Frank Lucas
You got red rubies, Mike bad, make movies
Turtle neck, hundred chains, dancing crazy, baby
And you know they call me Montana, baby

[Chorus: Lauren & Normani & Ally]
He like that bang, bang, bang
He like that bomb, bomb, bomb
He like that love, love, love
I'm like that drug, drug, drug
He trip when he on it (On it), one taste and he want it (One taste and he want it)
He like that bang, bang, bang, (He like that bang)
He like that bomb, bomb, bomb, (He like that bomb)
He like that love, love, love, (He like that love)
I'm like that drug, drug, drug, (Iâ€™m like that drug)
He trip when he on it (On it), one taste and he want it (One taste and...)

[Bridge: Lauren & (Ally)]
(Bang) He love that bang
(Bomb) He love that bomb, bomb, bomb
(Love) He love that thang
(Drug) He love that hit and run
He lose his brain
He going stupid dumb
He stupid dumb, all he ever want is some

[Pre-Chorus: Normani + Dinah & Lauren]
Pumps and a bump, pumps and a bump
He like the girls with the pumps and a bump (Oh)
Pumps and a bump (You know he wants some, wants some)
Pumps and a bump
I be that girl with the pumps and a bump

[Chorus: Lauren & Normani]
He like that bang, bang, bang
He like that bom, bom, bom
He like that love, love, love
I'm like that drug, drug, drug
He trip when he on it, one taste and he want it
He like that bang, bang, bang
He like that bom, bom, bom
He like that love, love, love
I'm like that drug, drug, drug
He trip when he on it, one taste and he want it
