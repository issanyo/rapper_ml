[Verse 1: French Montana]
She don't wanna' whine
See her man watchin'
Shorty going blind
Looking at the watch
Thousands on her bag, thousands on her hair
Thousands on her shoes, thousands in the air
Boat cruise pond the river
White ghost driver, blue dot sippa'
Baby girl nice take you on a trip
Around the world twice paid for life

[Verse 2: Nawlage]
I seen her outside the club
Told my nigga thats was sup (Dj Styles)
Seen her inside the club
Faithfully shaking her butt
I seen her dancing with her girlfriend
I didn't see a boyfriend
And when I tried to join in
I was so annoyed when she said

[Hook: Nawlage] 2x
She don't wanna' whine (no)
Cause her man too close by

She don't wanna' grind (no)
Cause her man too close by

[Verse 3: Nawlage]
I couldn't give up
I was trying to beat
I had a feeling she was lying to me
I haven't seen a man close to her
(tonight)
I'm not giving up
I'll get it
She's gonna' give it up
I'll get it
I'm not giving up (nope)
Not giving up (nope)
Not giving up
Even though still she says

[Hook: Nawlage] 2x
She don't wanna' whine (no)
Cause her man too close by

She don't wanna' grind (no)
Cause her man too close by

[Bridge: Nawlage]
After I put two and two together
I think I finally figured it out
She came here with a girl, shes dancing
With that girl, I saw shes with that girl
I tell em' shorty is a lesbian

[Verse 4: French Montana]
Shorty got a friend and her friend got
A friend too, (haa) that's the kind of shit
I be into
Pull up in the ghost, she pulled up in her
Bent
Know that car though money 8/10
Drinking all day she going both ways
Took her to the crib, now she gonna' pray
Shorty turned out, told her turn in
House on the water, know we going in (goin' in)

[Hook: Nawlage] 2x
She don't wanna' whine (no)
Cause her man too close by

She don't wanna' grind (no)
Cause her man too close by

[Nawlage]
(aha) Nawlage, now and days girl just wanna be
All lesbian, all lesbian, all lesbian
I had a better chance when she used to say

[Hook: Nawlage] 3x
She don't wanna' whine (no)
Cause her man too close by

She don't wanna' grind (no)
Cause her man too close by
