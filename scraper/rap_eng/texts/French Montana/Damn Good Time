[Intro]
Montana
Came this way we got one
You know what it is when you hear it

[Verse 1: Candice Boyd]
I'mma take one shot for every time he look me dead in my face
Talking 'bout it, he ain't do it
Oh dear, might as well leave the bottle right here
One shot for every bitch I had to put in her place
Talking crazy on my timeline this week throwing me shade, See me in the street, come catch my fade

[Pre-Hook: Candice Boyd]
I ain't even drunk as I wanna be yet
I don't wanna turn up, dammit I need it
I done had a week, I know you could see it
But I beat it

[Hook: Candice Boyd]
Now I don't care 'bout nothing but a damn good time tonight
All a nigga really need is a damn good time tonight
I need a drink and another one, somebody roll up
And roll another one up
I just wanna have a damn good time tonight
(Pour it up, pour it up)
(Pour it up, pour it up)
Pour it up, pour it up
Pour it up, pour it up

[Verse 2: Candice Boyd]
I don't need you looking at me, crazy when I walk in the place
All eyes on me, I know it
But if you tripping, I'mma trip and I'm loaded
I am so lit, I’m happy so don't come for me unless I send for ya
Trust me you don't really want that
I'm just letting you know, you don't wanna see me when I'm in my zone

[Pre-Hook: Candice Boyd]
I ain't even drunk as I wanna be yet
I don't wanna turn up, dammit I need it
I’ve been kind of weak, I know you could see it
But I beat it

[Hook: Candice Boyd]
Now I don't care 'bout nothing but a damn good time tonight
All a nigga really need is a damn good time tonight
I need a drink and another one, somebody roll up
And roll another one up
I just wanna have a damn good time tonight
(Pour it up, pour it up)
(Pour it up, pour it up)
Pour it up, pour it up
Pour it up, pour it up
Pour it up, pour it up
Pour it up, pour it up

[Verse 3: French Montana]
Once you cross the line, can't go back
Sitting by the bar, taking shots like Kodak
See you in the flash, Beatles in my class
Bugsy Sigel, Ghost Face with the eagle
Not even close, mafia coast
Bought my baby a Range and she bought me a Ghost
The G Fizzy, bonjour, baby come and ride the wave
Get a Visa for Ibiza, get high for days
We gon' drink until we pass out
You was with me from the trap house
We gon' pour it all up (all up all up)
Tonight's the night, we gon' drink it all up  (all up all up)

[Hook: Candice Boyd]
Now I don't care 'bout nothing but a damn good time tonight
All a nigga really need is a damn good time tonight
I need a drink and another one, somebody roll up
And roll another one up
I just wanna have a damn good time tonight
Pour it up, pour it up
Pour it up, pour it up
Pour it up, pour it up
Pour it up, pour it up
Pour it up, pour it up
Pour it up, pour it up
Pour it up, pour it up
Just wanna have a damn good time good time
Yeah
Ooh good time good time oooh
