I got a hundred chains on me right now
I got a dirty thirty on me right now
I bet them niggas hating on me right now
Right now, right now, right now
Its on me right now
Its with me right now
I be them niggas hating on me right now
Right now, right now, right now

[Meek Mill]
Leaning off on that double cup
Swerving off in that new machine
They ain't never had love for us
Now they hating we super clean
I say all of my life, all of these lights
Posted a picture get all of these likes
From all of this ice
If I get your bitch I'mma call it a night
And ball her tonight
And most of these niggas should call it a night
We balling for life
Popping these bottles I'm popping these models
I pop on the wheelie I pop on the clutch
Niggas ain't liver than us
[?] and that chopper go up
Brrrrttt hater
