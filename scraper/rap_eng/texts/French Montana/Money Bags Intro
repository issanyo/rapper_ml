I got a couple nicknames but for real
CME Sosalido, Joey Boombots, Frankie Forget-about-it
Richie, anybody know why Richie did Bobby Lupo
You know from the... This thing's boggin' out over here
Do you listen to em? Some washed up rappers from New York
No one drives around no more and smokes pot
And listens to lyrically music like that
They wanna go nuts, they wanna go to strip clubs
They wanna fuckin' see girls dancin' on poles, open up they boxes
You know the beucock, its a beucock, [?] between the legs
They love it. Last strip club I went to - forget it
The fuckin' girl she goes, "oh I can't wait for my song to come on"
I took her in the back, for a lap dance
We were fuckin' havin' the best time
The song "Twerk" came on, the girl went bananas
[?] grabbin' her titties, I banged her I swear to God
I banged the shit outta her
"Yeah alright, you didn't bang nothin'"
Yeah I did, that song makes girls wanna bang
Badaboom Badabang
