Skit by Donnel Rawlings

[Hook: Machine Gun Kelly]
Ech, pimpin 
I got fifty hoes on my dick ain't that some shit 
I got fifty hoes on my dick ain't that yo' bitch?
I got fifty hoes on my dick, every one of them vouchin'
I got fifty hoes
You got fifty hoes?
Hold on I’m counting, damn 
Fifty hoes, fifty hoes, fifty hoes on my dick x3
Fifty hoes, fifty hoes, every one of them vouchin', damn

[Verse 1: Machine Gun Kelly]
I got fifty hoes on my dick bitch
Fifty o's in my zip bitch
Burn the roof off this muhhfucka like I got fifty stoves in my whip bitch 
We all smoking and driving
Might as well say that I’m flying
Might as well call me the pilot
Bitches in my cockpit I don’t check mileage
I just fuck my ho like I’m 'sposed to
And when she bring her friends I fuck both
I brought the bitch to thanksgiving
Why?
Cus she fucks with me when I’m broke
Ain't nothing funny about the way I get money
And them Cleveland boys ain't no joke
I’m the truth and the truth is hard to swallow
So you better tell these bitches don’t choke, echo
I got one bitch, I got two bitch, I got three bitch, I got four
I tell the fifth bitch to tell sixth bitch to get the seventh bitch to bring mo'. 
Ain't no hand cuffin cousin
That bitch ain't on parole
And pimpin ain't easy pimp but pimpin's all that I know, god damn

[Verse 2: French Montana]
Ay ay ay ay ay Montana
I got fifty hoes on my dick 
I got bout fifty hoes on that strip 
I got bout fifty load in that grip
Ill put bout fifty holes in your fit
My roof way back 
Montana stay strapped
Fuckin niggas hate that 
Bad bitches play back 
My pinky 80 stacks 
Cash I’m coppin
Diamonds shining rocky ASAP
I told them I be pimpin on them bitches 
You can call me pimping ken
I fuck em once and tell em go and bring a friend 
She ain't seen a real nigga ball in a minute 
She ain't seen that money stacked tall to the ceiling
White Maybach no roof in the ceiling
When I take em to the crib all the bad bitches with it
