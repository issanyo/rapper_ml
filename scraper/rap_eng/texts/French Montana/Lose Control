[Verse 1: Dimello]
And she was just my type
5 foot 5, brown hair, green eyes
Her body shape so right
The way she put it on me Got me feelin’ so hot
Hotter than a muhfuc*a
Steady fiendin’ but I’m shier than a muhfuc*a
Couple shots of Patrone, and she chose
And you know how it goes, more shots, more shots I see ya shakin’
Don’t stop, don’t stop
And you already know what I want I’m about to lose control

[Hook: Dimello]
You already know that I’m bout to lose control
The way you move your body so slow Girl, I’m about to lose control
Touchin’ on me like we can go Girl, I’m about to lose control

Like a snake, shawty move a body Brakes skirt on the ‘gatti Swerve out the party
Shawty got a thang for em? And that money we be stackin’ to the ceiling
Gave a fuck about they feelins Paparazzi flash
