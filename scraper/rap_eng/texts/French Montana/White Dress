[Intro]
Hey [?]
Montana
They forgot who's battlin'?
Twenty bands
Made millions over a decade
We ain't losing though

[Bridge]
I pray we live
For a thousand years
And if I hurt you
Baby drink CÃ®roc for your tears

[Chorus]
'Cause you control my vices
I just want to fuck you on your night shift
Driveway lookin' like midlife crisis
You control my vices
We was up grindin' on the night shift
I'll bet, gave my dog suicidal crisis
Priceless, I just want to fuck you in your white dress
I'll bet, oh I think she like it
Talk to me nicely, oww
Talk to me nicely, oww

[Verse]
I got you
Closet lookin' like Milan Fashion Week, I got you
Money jumpin' like Lebron, Dominique, I got you
Better do or die
A hundred with the guy
Pull up with the god
Wraith with the styles
Talk to me so reckless
Diamonds on my necklace
Chest playin' checkers
The Avion breakfast
Dimes clean dirty wine though
See the future like I'm Rocko
And I fall feel like Chapo
Fuckin' all these foreign chicks
Put some hoes in foreigns
You thought she was yours
She smell like Michael Kors
Shoes fuckin' up my floors
Who that nigga? I'm the definition
Wearin' penny loafers, we ain't penny pinchin'
Got the baddest bitches baggin' in the kitchen
Got that Bobby Brown, we that new edition
These rappers ain't Nas
Just look at their commas
I skate on the diamonds
I smoke with the farmers
Buy my shoes small, goin' toe to toe
I burn my bridges I'ma call the boat
Willie beaming with the audible
Ballin' like I'm Earl Manigault
They countin' to the south
The bag is a mountain
I fucked my accountant
That pussy's a fountain
I pledge of allegiance
You better believe it
I boarded a flight
Trump fucked up a Visa
Bitch I'm no regular, bitch I'm no second
Know the one, I'm the one that's ahead of ya
If you talk mills, bitch I'm affiliate
Ciroc boy, [?] a million

[Chorus]
'Cause you control my vices
I just want to fuck you on your nice shit
Driveway lookin' like midlife crisis
You control my vices
We was up grindin' on the night shift
I'll bet, gave my dog suicidal crisis
Priceless, I just want to fuck you in your white dress
I'll bet, oh I think she like it
Talk to me nicely, oww
Talk to me nicely, oww
'Cause you control my vices
I just want to fuck you on your nice shit
Driveway lookin' like midlife crisis
You control my vices
We was up grindin' on the night shift
I'll bet, gave my dog suicidal crisis
Priceless, I just want to fuck you in your white dress
I'll bet, oh I think she like it
Talk to me nicely, oww
Talk to me nicely, oww
