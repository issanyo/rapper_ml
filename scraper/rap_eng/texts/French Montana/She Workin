[Chorus: Marc E. Bassy]
Baby, I'm 'bout your love (can't stop, no)
I'm trying to let these demons out (can't stop, no)
Baby, you know me too well (oh no)
Once we get it goin' we don't stop
So stop now, can't stop, no

[Verse 1: Marc E. Bassy]
And, baby, I'm blacking out
I think we got to order more (can't stop, no)
And, girl, I don't know what we did (what we did, what we did)
That evidence right on the floor
On the floor, on the floor

[Refrain: French Montana]
Mmm, she know what to do with it
Gotta make a move strong, can't fool with it
She movin' like a fool with it
All that ass, let me show you what to do with it
I ain't slipping that's the rules with it
Baby, is you fooling me or are you fooling 'em
I'ma catch that off the rim
And I hope your man cool when I'm calling you

[Verse 2: French Montana]
Don't be acting like Iggy all fancy
Shoutout to Selena for the mansion
Shawty on the Bieber, she dancing
Catch me with J Lo in the Hamptons
Shawty got a groove, let's make this a vibe
Back at the crib playing ball with Sanaa
Me and my niggas we came up from the block
Now we on top, got the crew with me

[Pre-Chorus: Marc E. Bassy]
She working and I know
All the things that she do on the low
She flirts and yeah she bad
You know she could spend and make it back
(Montana)

[Chorus: Marc E. Bassy]
Baby, I'm 'bout your love (can't stop)
I'm trying to let these demons out (can't stop, no)
But, baby, you know me too well
Once we get it going we don't stop
So stop now, can't stop no

[Refrain: French Montana]
Mmm, she know what to do with it
Gotta make a move strong, can't fool with it
She moving like a fool with it
All that ass, let me show you what to do with it
I ain't slippin' that's the rules with it
Baby, is you fooling me or are you fooling 'em
I'ma catch that off the rim
And I hope you meant cool when I'm calling you

[Pre-Chorus: Marc E. Bassy]
She working and I know
All the things that she do on the low
She flirts and yeah she bad
You know she could spend and make it back
(Montana)

[Verse 3: French Montana]
I fell in love with her overseas
Scared trump might fuck up the visa
We in that drop, head bumping shawty
Love you like Kanye love Kanye
Love you like Whitney loved Bobby
Canary rock can't fit through your front pocket
She got expensive taste
Met her last night, moved her in the crib today

[Chorus: Marc E. Bassy]
Baby, I'm 'bout your love
(Montana)
I'm trying to let these demons out
(Bassy, you know what it is)
But, baby, you know me too well
Once we get it going we don't stop (Don't stop)
So stop it (don't stop it), can't stop it
(Haaan)
