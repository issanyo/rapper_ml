[Hook]
Some people like to get away
Some people like to get away
Take a holiday from the neighborhood
Take flights to Miami beach or to Hollywood
But I'm taking the greyhound
On that Hudson River line
I'm in the New York State of Mind

[Verse 1]
Fornication at an all-time high
Tryna make it was a full time job
I mean damn near lottery, damn near robbery
Coming from the bottom, see grinding never bothered me
Cooking on the stove while my brain fried
Hustle by the same sign serving them
Me and Arthur Ashe had the same job
Sacrifices, going through the crisis
Working with a little guy, negotiating prices
All the years we was real close
Now I see these faces on the pictures
Man, wishing we was here toastin'
Man that is what it be
But this time I take away your misery and make it mine
Fame

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Can I Live with prices in my head?
Talk the life is doin bizz, say I help em learn to pray
Turn my high thoughts to a jackpot
Hard head niggas soft ass shorty, ass soft in the hard top
Clean with it, 30 clip make you lean wit it
Niggas talk about it, but we live it
Secret society try to keep an eye on me
Body and soul fast money and hoes
We're gonna hate you til you leave
Matter of fatigue
All winter, fish for cheap; Long John Silver
Lows with the highs, sweatin tellin lies
Finger to the boys, got everybody doin time
Since day one payday, A1 grade A
Second place first loser
We made it thank music
Corner made lions hit the block when your baby crying
Had to slang the montega til we see them sirens
Slip through the back door, come clap the back board
Get it when you're supposed to, never when you aks for it
Fuck niggas seeing copy, ask E and Gobbie
Niggas haul trends, we cover all ends
Back to the top, throw the top in the back in the coupe mean
Bitch see the crib, try to move in
Herb those, hoes never turned good bitches
But the good bitches turned hoes
Long ball with us

[Hook]
