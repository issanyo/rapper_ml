[Hook: SmokeDawg]
I cop it, repress it, I’m reckless I stretch it, remixing the dope
I turn a 2 into a 4 bag it up and I sell it for low
Trap, trap, trap, trap nigga it's all we know
Only real killers and drug dealers up in my bando nigga in my bando
Trap house doing numbers
Trap, trap house doing numbers
Trap house doing numbers
Trap house doing numbers
Trap, trap house doing numbers
In the field up with gunners
Don't come up from the spot, hear the drop, we don't deal with newcomers
Trap house doing numbers
Trap house doing numbers
Trap house doing numbers
Trap house doing numbers

[Verse 1: SmokeDawg]
My number 1 client call me up and said "Smoke I need a pigeon" (Where you at?)
So I copped it, repressed it
My bitch do the dishes
AK do the dropoff and lets do the pitchin'
Hoes love how we livin'
You gotta be a fisher just to step in my kitchen
And my hitters efficient
So Capo don't miss when he blowing that Smithen
Shooting guard is his position
He gon' shoot from a distance, he ain't leavin' no witness
To make it out the hood, no nigga that's the number 1 mission
So I invest in a Pyrex pot then my money start flippin'
Hey I be chippin, OT and Blacks flippin' packs that's how I made my livin' (OT)
I don't deal with new niggas cuz the new niggas be the ones snitchin' (No new niggas)
Burner on me I be grippin'
Rarri got the beamy gon' flip him
Shots let stumble then we trip him
Make sure he finished then we dip in (Gang)

[Verse 2: French Montana]
Reppin' the 6 so you reppin' the 5
Homie is drippin', I hit 'em with 6 and I hit you with 5
I came for them commas
Assalamualaikum on a plane full of Hummers
South Bronx with the gunners
Trap house doin' numbers
Got hundreds on hundreds on hundreds ducked in the safe
Trap doin' numbers
My youngings'll hit ya zip you up right in your face
Got a for (?) runnin'
Hit ya now nigga who frontin'?
With my blood gettin' blue money
Maybach cost 220
Dash fast lane 220
Trap house doin' no numbers
Ya I'm stuntin' with no Hummer
Break the whole cake down homie all crumbles
Break the whole thing down homie all bundles
I'm in the trap doin' poor numbers
I'm in the trap countin' more numbers
Stash racked up more hundreds
Couple racks for the young runners
Bail money for my young gunners
Every other day change the phone number
