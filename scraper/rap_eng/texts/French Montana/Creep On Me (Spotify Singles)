[Verse 1]
My heart going up and down when it’s you I see
All these girls so salty cause you’re so sweet
You ain’t the one that I want, you the one I need
Telling your friends that you’re really not in love with me

[Pre-Chorus]
You can keep on frontin' but I know
You like that, why you acting like that?
You can keep on frontin' but I know
You like that, why you acting like that?

[Chorus]
Because you creep on me when you’re alone
And you act like you can’t fall in love
Every single night you call my phone
Always asking if nobody’s home
You need to come around like the summertime
You bring bright light into my life
When I’m with you I feel alright
Come around like the summer time
You bring bright light into my life
When I’m with you I feel alright

[Bridge]
I never thought that our love would've gone so deep
And if it ain't love then I don't really know what it means
This is something that we always dream
I know holdin' back, don't be shy, put it all on me

[Pre-Chorus]
You can keep on frontin' but I know
You like that, why you acting like that?
You can keep on frontin' but I know
You like that, why you acting like that?

[Chorus]
Because you creep on me when you’re alone
And you act like you can’t fall in love
Every single night you call my phone
Always asking if nobody’s home
You need to come around like the summertime
You bring bright light into my life
When I’m with you I feel alright
Come around like the summer time
You bring bright light into my life
When I’m with you I feel alright
