[Chorus]
All we do is flex
On that steroids, bitch watch that money stretch
Never knew nothin', now I'm stuntin' cause I'm on
Pilot turned around and he asked me where I'm goin'
I told him
Fuck away from these niggas, fuck away from these hoes
Fuck away from these niggas, fuck away from these hoes
I told him
Fuck away from these niggas, fuck away from these hoes
Fuck away from these niggas, fuck away from these hoes
I told him

[Verse 1]
Fuck away from these niggas, fuck away from these hoes
I be gone off that liquor, I would've made about eight figures
Got my main bitch, my top back, my good badge, I got that
I want that I cop that, my money good I don't hide that
Got grip on my lap and my roof on my back
Ride, strapped from the east to the west side
Clear port my Lear', fuck boys out there
Spendin' stash like huh, on these drawers I wear
In them cars I don't test drive, a strap by my bedside
I dump off like bedtime, broads I get head shine
Straight off top, my dog lick off shot
Talkin' chopper sound nigga, lift up a whole block

[Chorus]
All we do is flex
On that steroids, bitch watch that money stretch
Never knew nothin', now I'm stuntin' cause I'm on
Pilot turned around and he asked me where I'm goin'
I told him
Fuck away from these niggas, fuck away from these hoes
Fuck away from these niggas, fuck away from these hoes
I told him
Fuck away from these niggas, fuck away from these hoes
Fuck away from these niggas, fuck away from these hoes
I told him

[Verse 2]
Counting cash sound like the sweetest song I ever heard
I ain't talk about no cars, I ain't talk about no kilos
Where I'm from just dope fiends, ain't no motherfuckin' heroes
My shades up, my tints up, my toes down, my heads up
I ain't never pulled my legs up, now my team's strong my bread's up
My drug dealers, pimps, killers all up in here
Chinchillas, car dealer I be all up in there
And ain't no nigga showed me how to move, had to learn though
Now I'm gettin' money fast, watch niggas burn slow
Coke boys we mobbin', bad hoes be lovin'
Just a bunch of young niggas thuggin', Montana

[Chorus]
All we do is flex
On that steroids, bitch watch that money stretch
Never knew nothin', now I'm stuntin' cause I'm on
Pilot turned around and he asked me where I'm goin'
I told him
Fuck away from these niggas, fuck away from these hoes
Fuck away from these niggas, fuck away from these hoes
I told him
Fuck away from these niggas, fuck away from these hoes
Fuck away from these niggas, fuck away from these hoes
I told him

[Bridge]
Ahhh, ahhh, ahhhhhh, ohhh
Ahhh, ahhh, ahhh, ohhh

[Chorus]
All we do is flex
On that steroids, bitch watch that money stretch
Never knew nothin', now I'm stuntin' cause I'm on
Pilot turned around and he asked me where I'm goin'
I told him
Fuck away from these niggas, fuck away from these hoes
Fuck away from these niggas, fuck away from these hoes
I told him
Fuck away from these niggas, fuck away from these hoes
Fuck away from these niggas, fuck away from these hoes
I told him
