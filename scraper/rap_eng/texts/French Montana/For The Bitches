[Intro]
I mean
I mean bitch I’m JM

[Verse 1: Joe Moses]
Two hundred, three hundred, fuck the club up
Better watch what you say or get fucked up
Call Power, call Felli, this my new shit
Whole team got an eight like a pool stick

Pour a twelve in a two liter leaning
Chase a mil like a nigga still dreaming
Hit play house, hood rat, fiending
Get brain like a motherfucking genius

(Where you been JM?) At the trap
Sitting back, selling weed, cooking crack
Got a plug like I work up at a Best Buy
I’m connected with Columbian neck tie

Next time [?]
Thought the Bentley was the shit 'till I seen Wraith
Fuck a bitch in the spot on the first date
First date, Ken Griffey down to home base

No play, no way, never like me
Hood nigga, fucking bitches off of TV
Floss money, this the way a nigga living
Keep it cool, I’m just looking for the bitches

[Hook]
Hit the club with a band on me
Keep a gun ‘case a nigga wanna jam on me
Ride foreign, this the way a nigga living
Keep it fresh for the motherfucking bitches

Hit the club for the bitches
Ride foreigns for the bitches
Bought a Rolly for the bitches
Fucking bitches with the bitches

[Verse 2: Joe Moses]
Why you fresh? Shit I do it for the bitches
Bought a Rolly off a bitch like I’m pimping
Lil Mike got a chopper and he tripping
One thing, we don’t fuck with no snitches

Big gun, got money like an athlete
Send shots, leave him running like a track meet
Hundred pounds in the middle of the back seat
If my bitch wanna cheat, better ask me

Went up a band off the motherfucking bando
My nigga Dopey in flock, got the Lambo
My nigga Banks in the bitch with no shoes on
My nigga [?] got the Phantom with the Sioux on

Go to court with the vest and the tool on
AOB going brazy like a group home
Got it hot in the city like it’s [?]
And my niggas gotta eat like the food gone

No play, no way, never like me
Hood niggas fucking bitches off of TV
Floss money, this the way a nigga living
Keep it cool, I’m just looking for the bitches

[Hook]

[Verse 3: French Montana]
Pull up in the Rolls, head on
If you broke, then shut up
Started pushing [?] pitch black
Rap paid for the rich rap

Now I'm feeling like Moses
Closet looking like [?]
Do it for the bitches
Five [?], shoot it like a pistol

I pull up to the club, got your [?] on me
I told her, "Get naked, keep your heels on"
White Wraith, crib with the white [?]
[?]

[Hook]
