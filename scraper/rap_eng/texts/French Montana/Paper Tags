Jadakiss has a lot of all-star collaborations on his 2012 DJ Drama-sponsored mixtape "Consignment"
One of the songs on the compilation features Wale & French Montana, it's titled "Paper Tags" and it was produced by Jahlil Beats

[Hook: French Montana]
Sleeping on the yacht
Rollin off a Bentley
Showin you her back
I’m tryna get it in

[Verse 1: Wale & Jadakiss]
New whip, paper tags, same checks, spend the cash
A young black nigga on a fucking rap
But that’s some bad luck years if you in the path of a jag
Got much to say, hallelujah I do it
If pussy was music, I would have…rubies
Montana, nigga stay schemin
8G’s in the peas, killing …
V12, paper tags, you know I like mine in the paper bags
Hop and go, make it fast
Cut it with the rock scizz, make it last
Tread mill and I’m in the sonar
When you getting money you get caught up in the moment
While that sucker shit, real niggas…
You can get it, depending on how bad you want it

[Hook: French Montana]
Sleeping on the yacht
Rollin off a Bentley
Showin you her back
I’m tryna get it in

[Verse 2: Jadakiss & Styles P]
Cocaine, D block, double MG, we got the streets locked
We be high like a motherfucker
On some niggas that we ride like a motherfucker
Sipping on that yap, rolling of a beat
Shawty on her back, I’m trying to get it in
New 9, paper tags, stay … but you ain’t where the lakers at
Waterproof Uzzi when I take a bath
Mind goose nigga cut a motherfucking snake in half
Mind taken, … big ass guns stand in front of it
It’s only real niggas I get blunted with
I only give a fuck about niggas I get hunneds with
Triple bean, paper tags, give you the whole thing
Just pay for half
Think about it, do the math
Wired it to my account, screw the cash
Kobe’s corporate, give them a good batch and they won’t get off it
Sharp claws but they still open of it
I ain’t satisfied till they close the coffin

[Hook:French Montana]
Sleeping on the yacht
Rollin off a Bentley
Showin you her back
I’m tryna get it in

[Outro: French Montana]
Cocaine, D block, double MG, we got the streets locked
We be high like a motherfucker
On some niggas that we ride like a motherfucker
Sleeping on the yacht
Rollin off a Bentley
Showin you her back
I’m tryna get it in
