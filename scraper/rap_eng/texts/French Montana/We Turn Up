It's Friday night
So you know that it's going down
Everybody looking for a party
We got all the invitations
And we choosing now
Wherever we go, it doesn't even matter

Let me get it right
...
Running this town like a mayor
No we never Miami bu we bring the Heat
Wherever we go, it doesn't even matter

Ooh the lights are on me now
And we dance the night away
The DJ bumping loud

So we go all night till we see the sunlight
Let me turn up, let me turn up
Now we're on the floor 'cause you want some more
Let me turn up, let me turn up
Hands up and down cause the club is loud
Let me turn up, let me turn up

When we walk in to the room people stop and stare
Everybody knows we are the party
Put our hands up to the roof like we just don't care
Wherever we go, it doesn't even matter

Going to make it rain like ...
All the people start to get crazy
I step out of the ... wheen you see my ...
Wherever we go, it doesn't even matter

Ooh the lights are on me now
And we dance the night away
The DJ bumping loud

So we go all night till we see the sunlight
Let me turn up, let me turn up
Now we're on the floor 'cause you want some more
Let me turn up, let me turn up
Hands up and down cause the club is loud
Let me turn up, let me turn up

[Verse: French Montana]
Montana
I heard they hating on me
Got a hundred chains on me
Private planes on me
Let me turn up with you
Three cribs three ... in the kitchen
She got me on a mission
...
Bahamas, all big diamonds
The best things in life we can buy for free
We turn up all night Anjali

Ooh the lights are on me now
And we dance the night away
The DJ bumping loud
(Turn up)

So we go all night till we see the sunlight
Let me turn up(Turn up), let me turn up(Turn up)
Now we're on the floor 'cause you want some more
Let me turn up(Turn up), let me turn up(Turn up)
Hands up and down cause the club is loud
Let me turn up, let me turn up [x2]
