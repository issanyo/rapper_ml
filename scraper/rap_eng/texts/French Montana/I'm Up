[Intro: Omarion, Kid Ink & (French Montana)]
Omarion
Oh (haaanh)
It's Kid Ink (Montana)
And your chick, yo' chick

[Hook: Omarion]
Baby I'm the man, I'm up
Couple hundred bands on the car
Villa and a mansion, uh, I'm that nigga
I'm that nigga, I'm that nigga
I'm with my niggas, bring more bitches

[Verse 1: Omarion]
Girl, I got the mojo
See you when you double tap the photo
She ain't into logos (nope!)
Living single like Maxine, I'ma have her singing like Coko
(I get so weak) ...in the knees
Can't cuff me, bitch please
You can get involved
You know who to call when your man Duval, too small, no Lacey
Cause I'm up
Zero, zero, zero, comma
Heard you looking for a sponsor
Well you gon' have to ride this anaconda

[Hook: Omarion & Kid Ink]
Baby I'm the man, I'm up
Couple hundred bands on the car
Villa and a mansion, uh, I'm that nigga
I'm that nigga, I'm that nigga
Coming thru with my niggas, bring more bitches

[Verse 2: Kid Ink]
It's no pretending
That we've be getting to it all night
I'm off so much liquor
Probably did a couple things that my girl won't like
Red light
Gotta slow it down, get my head right
Try and take it to the hotel, yeah right
Talking 'bout she won't tell, yeah right
I already know the finessing
I don't answer like it's bill collectors
Shawty try'na act so wreckless, I don't even stress it
See we got her going up 'til breakfast club

[Verse 3: French Montana]
Shawty saw the wings on the car
She forgot about her plans for tomorrow
Best friend next room, ear to the wall
Cause I'm that nigga, haan
I'm on the boss, don, baby ahh
She gon' throw it up, she gon' break it down
Shawty got her own
But she can't find a nigga like me

[Hook: Omarion]
Baby I'm the man, I'm up
Couple hundred bands on the car
Villa and a mansion, uh, I'm that nigga
I'm that nigga, I'm that nigga
I'm with my niggas, bring more bitches

[Bridge: Kid Ink & Omarion]
Comin' through, commas, commas, commas
Commas, commas, commas
That's what we been goin' through, commas, commas, commas
Commas, commas, commas
Feelin' like, fuck what you goin' through commas, commas, commas
Commas, commas, commas
We been goin' through, commas, commas, commas
Commas, commas, commas
Feelin' like, fuck what you goin' through

[Hook: Omarion]
Baby I'm the man, I'm up (Uh-Huh)
Couple hundred bands on the car (Yeah)
Villa and a mansion (And you know), uh, I'm that nigga
(One time)
I'm that nigga (One time), I'm that nigga
(One time)
With my niggas (One time), bring more bitches

[Outro: Omarion]
Baby come through (uh-huh)
Baby, baby come through (yeah)
Tell your girls to come through (and you know)
And it's all on you, ohh
