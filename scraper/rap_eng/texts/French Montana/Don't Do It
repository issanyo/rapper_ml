[Hook]
Them niggas got an attitude when we pull in them cars
Shutting down the avenue and they start actin’ like ‘em broads
Don’t, don’t do it, don’t, don’t do it, don’t, don’t do it!
(Turn the lights down)

[Verse 1: Fat Joe]
They call me Joey PYREX, cause I whip it the good
Niggas ain’t recognize yet, but they bitches do
Nah, I ain’t throwin’ up no sets, but my niggas do
Versace frames, Versace chains, that’s what Big would do
Aquafina, she got that Aquafina
So much ass up in this car, you would think it’s La Marina
And this chain weigh two kilos, bought that bitch in 88′
Tattoo Al Pacino, [?] deep dish in that paper plate
(Don’t do it!) I’mma work of art but these gats deep
(Don’t do it!) I’m Leonardo, Great Gatsby
Swimming pools, day parties, white girls doin’ cocaine prolly
She gave strep, she’ll leave ok, that bitch sound like James Harden

[Hook]
Them niggas got an attitude when we pull in them cars
Shutting down the avenue and they start actin’ like ‘em broads
Don’t, don’t do it, don’t, don’t do it, don’t, don’t do it!
(Montana, turn the lights on!)

[Verse 2: French Montana]
All my dawgs stylin’, got em feelin’ awkward
Them niggas foul, Joey Crawford
Don’t do it, [?], eight digits, blew it
And I caught up whippin’ hard like Martha Stewart
I’m talkin’ thirty chains, thirty clip a pint
Gettin’ brain, make a mill, watchin’ niggas change
Shit get strange, them coke boys be whylin’
Drop head, no molly, More O’s, more problems
I say fuck hoes, more comic

[Hook]
Them niggas got an attitude when we pull in them cars
Shutting down the avenue and they start actin’ like ‘em broads
Don’t, don’t do it, don’t, don’t do it, don’t, don’t do it!
(Turn the lights on!)

[Verse 3: Rico Love]
Black drop-top, drop-crotch, call me Hammer Time
Rolley black face with yellow diamonds, that’s a Dandelion
Phantom Spaceship, I could try that bitch and recline
And when you go to Hublot, tell em my name
The owner’s a friend of mine
I’m on every station, listen for my adlib
You came for vacation but nigga that’s where I live
Gave my daddy my Benz, gave my momma my Grammys
Still the king of the mill and I run that bitch from Miami
Do somethin’, nigga!

[Hook]
Them niggas got an attitude when we pull in them cars
Shutting down the avenue and they start actin’ like ‘em broads
Don’t, don’t do it, don’t, don’t do it, don’t, don’t do it!
(Turn the lights on!)
