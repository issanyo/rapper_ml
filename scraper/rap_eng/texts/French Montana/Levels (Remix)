[Intro: Meek Mill]
See, it's brackets, nigga
Them hoes ain't fuckin' you
‘Cause you ain't in that bracket, nigga
Learn life, it's levels to this shit, young boy
Aye, O, you feel me?

[Hook: Meek Mill]
Lil nigga, we don't rock the same clothes
Fuck the same hoes, ‘cause it's levels to this shit
Lil nigga, we don't drive the same whips
We don't fuck the same chicks, ‘cause it's levels to this shit
Lil nigga, we don't get the same paper
You a motherfuckin' hater, boy, it's levels to this shit
Lil nigga, ‘cause it's levels to this shit
Lil nigga, ‘cause it's levels to this shit—oh Lord!

[Verse 1: Meek Mill]
‘Cause it's levels to this shit, levels to this shit
Can't fuck my ho, ‘cause it's levels to this bitch
And I be rockin' Prada like a devil in this bitch
And a Birkin bag like a gold medal to this bitch
And I'm heavy as it get
Shinin' like a motherfuckin' bezel on my wrist
All my niggas mobbin' so we heavy in this bitch
30 grand for the Muller, that's a Chevy on my wrist
Woo! Cocaine Mulsanne
Young nigga blowin' up; Kurt Cobain—boom!
Skatin' on them like I'm Lil Wayne
And this 458 don't do the lil lane—vroom!
Swerve on 'em, niggas gotta nerve on 'em
‘Cause I heard the feds got him and he had them birds on him
But a nigga back home and now niggas roll with him
Caught a case, what you think? Nigga fuckin' told on him
I ain't get my shit snatched yet
You ain't get your bitch back yet
One call, niggas aim that TEC
Blood drawn, headshot, nigga brains on step
Hot shit if you pop shit
And I don't want your opinion if you ain't got shit
We young niggas, we winnin', I pull up, drop shit
Mob shit, with more keys than a locksmith

[Hook: Meek Mill & Puff Daddy]
Lil nigga, we don't rock the same clothes
Fuck the same hoes, ‘cause it's levels to this shit
Lil nigga, we don't drive the same whips
We don't fuck the same chicks, ‘cause it's levels to this shit
Lil nigga, we don't get the same paper
You a motherfuckin' hater, boy, it's levels to this shit (yo, Meek)
Lil nigga, ‘cause it's levels to this shit (aye, yo, Meek, let me talk to these niggas man)
Lil nigga, ‘cause it's levels to this shit—oh Lord!

[Verse 2: Puff Daddy]
Yeah, take that, take that
One-point-two matte-black Maybach
Y'all niggas burnt out, racetrack
Bad boy, nigga, fuck around, bring mase back
Y'all niggas hate that, come and get rocky like A$AP
She poppin' on the Molly, she chase that
Red dot, blue dot, here ho, drink that
What up?
Half a milly in the bank
Afford a jet, spend a [?] in the tank
You lil' niggas couldn't last in this ring
Ayy, yo, nigga, I just bought me a bank
'Cause there's levels to this shit
Motherfucker, there's some levels to this shit
We talkin' money, I'm a veteran at this
Bad boy, rich niggas, we so heavy in this bitch

[Hook: Meek Mill & French Montana]
Lil nigga, we don't rock the same clothes
Fuck the same hoes, ‘cause it's levels to this shit
Lil nigga, we don't drive the same whips
We don't fuck the same chicks, ‘cause it's levels to this shit
Lil nigga, we don't get the same paper
You a motherfuckin' hater, boy, it's levels to this shit
Lil nigga, ‘cause it's levels to this shit
Lil nigga, ‘cause it's levels to this shit (hah, Montana) — oh Lord!

[Verse 3: French Montana]
When he talk about drums, have you met him with the shit?
Talk about climbing four levels with this shit
Your watch ain't even worth bezel on my shit
Two lumps on her ass, lookin' camel with this shit (hah)
Talk about the game, Slick Rick with the chains
Tim duckin' in the [?], [?] Davis with the aim (blah)
Hit niggas, paramedics zip niggas
Who you thought was real, nigga?
In the line of pickin' niggas
Started from the bottom, now we high on the hill
Started from a dollar, now them niggas makin' mills
Philly with the eagle with my nigga, Meek Mill
High like The Beatles on the perc, on the pills (hah)
We don't fuck with no bitch (hah)
Been fuckin' your bitch
We don't fuck with no nigga (hah)
They don't fuck with my niggas

[Hook: Meek Mill]
Lil nigga, we don't rock the same clothes
Fuck the same hoes, ‘cause it's levels to this shit
Lil nigga, we don't drive the same whips
We don't fuck the same chicks, ‘cause it's levels to this shit
Lil nigga, we don't get the same paper
You a motherfuckin' hater, boy, it's levels to this shit
Lil nigga, ‘cause it's levels to this shit
Lil nigga, ‘cause it's levels to this shit—oh Lord!
