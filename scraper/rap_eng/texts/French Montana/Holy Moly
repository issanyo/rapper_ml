[Hook]
Holy Moly, diamonds on my Rollie
Holy Moly, diamonds on my Rollie
Holy Moly, diamonds on my Rollie
Holy Moly, diamonds on my Rollie
Hocus pocus, rare meat with vultures
Hocus pocus, got your bitch focused
Hocus pocus, eating rare meat with vultures
Hocus pocus, got your bitch focused

[Verse 1]
I'ma break it down then go collect it
And if I go down ima call collect
Take her to the mansion and take her to the boat
I be popping pills they be sniffing snow
I'm bumping on that Marley smoking that Jamaican
Wheelies on the harley South Queens, Jamaica
500 hundred rounds, 500 hundred thou car crews
5 star telly, 5 star bitches all choosing

[Hook]
Holy Moly, diamonds on my Rollie
Holy Moly, diamonds on my Rollie
Holy Moly, diamonds on my Rollie
Holy Moly, diamonds on my Rollie
Hocus pocus, rare meat with vultures
Hocus pocus, got your bitch focused
Hocus pocus, eating rare meat with vultures
Hocus pocus, got your bitch focused

[Verse 2]
Diamonds on my Rollie chains like a jewel
My bitch from Cuba and my lawyer Jewish
Hocus pocus, sniping bitches disappear
Sippin on this clear I ain't thinking clear
Look at my Rollie
Sipping and pimping like Goldie
I'ma [?] like I'm Tony, Silver Surfer macaroni
In that drop head with the lemon head hundred, no diamond
Shorty cop me 10 Rollies still got no time for her

[Hook]
Holy Moly, diamonds on my Rollie
Holy Moly, diamonds on my Rollie
Holy Moly, diamonds on my Rollie
Holy Moly, diamonds on my Rollie
Hocus pocus, rare meat me with vultures
Hocus pocus, got your bitch focused
Hocus pocus, [eating rare meat(8701236) with vultures
Hocus pocus, got your bitch focused
