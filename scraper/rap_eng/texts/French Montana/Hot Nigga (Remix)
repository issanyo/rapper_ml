Montana
You know when you hear that haaann
Shmurda

[Verse]
Made my first mill, start tweaking, ho
And told my old bitch I ain't speaking, ho
Montana, I'm a block nigga
You heard they shot me and I shot niggas
Young Hov, boy, said I rock niggas
Three bricks for a verse, that's a swap, nigga
Shout my nigga Meek, he on lock, nigga
Shout my nigga Max, he in a box, nigga
Pull up La Marina in a yacht, nigga
Then skate off like a pirate with ya thot, nigga
You heard she's a freaky ho
Bitch ain't loyal, she fucked Breezy, ho
Believe me, you can ask Weezy, ho
I heard she fucked Puff like a week ago
But I still want the pussy though
I'mma Shmurda dance on the pussy, ho
That bitch ass full of bulletholes
Still pay couple grands for that pussy, ho
I'mma Shmurda dance on the pussy, ho
I'mma Shmurda dance on the pussy, ho
I'mma Shmurda dance on the pussy, ho
I'mma Shmurda dance on the pussy, ho
