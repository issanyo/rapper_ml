Used to dust 'em off and pass 'em to Chinx
Fuck me like an animal, I buy you minks
We ain't work for that, nah we can't do that
Black rose in the concrete grew where the pavement at
Two hoes want my eyes, be like "where the payment at?"
Two hoes, three dice, we was shakin' that
It is what it is man, God rolled it
She gonna deep throat with her eyes open, yeah
Ciroc shots in the air
Talk about me and my bitch
Me and Cash in the Lamb', we got two chains
Came from the bottom like loose change
Jumpin' on these niggas, 23
She jabbin' on these suckers for her fee
They know the dope real on the real though
She got her legs open like field goal, yeah
Ciroc shots in the air

Back to back Wraiths, bitch the Holy Ghost
Blowin' smoke, sippin' Hen' till I overdose, yeah
Ciroc shots in the air

Straight fill the cash, clash me the title
Wait for it, wait for it
Wait for it, wait for it
Besides the main bitch takin' everyone

Ciroc shots in the air
