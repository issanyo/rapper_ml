[Intro: DJ Suss One] (Junior Reid)
Yo Reid you know what? (They hatin' on me!)
You damn right they hatin'! (They hatin' on me!)
They didn't want me to make it this far baby! DJ Suss One!

[Chorus: Junior Reid] (Floyd Mayweather Jr.) (*DJ Suss One) (**Jadakiss)
I am a champion, I'm a champion, I'm a champion
I'm a champion, whoooooaaaa oh!
(Money May! Suss One! The Featured Presentation!
I'm the one! Let's go!)
All my fans are, in the arena
They all chearin' for, meeeeeeee!(*Yo J I told these niggas!)
At the same time, haters out there, they all hatin' on, me
(*Y'all wanna underestimate me!)
I am a champion (**Yeah!)  I'm a champion (**Yeah!)
I'm a champion (HE-HEHHHH!) I'm a champion, whoooooaaaa oh!
(*I'm built for this shit, yo Kiss holla at these niggas!)

[Verse 1: Jadakiss]
Uh! Yo! Underrated undisputed as far as when it comes to music
I stepped in the ring, with the belts and I ain't come to lose it
Shakin' up the town more, prayin' for my downfall
God had to fall back cause Satan is around y'all
I am, the last of a breed that's dyin'
Eye of the tiger, heart of a lion
Catch me in the trap as long as they buyin'
Or until I see the lights and hear the sirens
You wouldn't dare go where I been already
That's why losin' ain't on my itinerary
They just came in and I done moved ten already
Rest in peace to the rappers in the cemetery
Yeah! You gone need a reservation
In case you didn't know this is the featured presentation
Dumpin' on site squeezin' with no hesitation
I made it through the hate and all the underestimation
WHAT!

[Chorus: Junior Reid]

[Verse 2: Lloyd Banks]
Uh! I'm straight off the bench with this, murder for my sentences
Lethal like the burner knock a burglar through the entrances
It's the M dot, V dot, P stops when you bark the tree stops
I'm lyrically bombs makin' MC's drop
Product of the weed spot, all of my sixteen's hot
Ring pop like I wanna chip, chick in a clean drop
Platinum in my after life, Queens days Manhattan nights
Purple haze takes me to paradise, I'm bad as twice
Niggas settlin' for last, rather have the average type
Me I flip the paddles right, gotta have that appetite
Y'all come off the crowd you stare, we 'gon make it loud in here
It's our year, victory laps, laps is a power steer
Champagne at the finish line, send 'em here it's dinner time
Banks the real nigga' kind, thanks to hard livin' I'm
Back headed for bigger shine, hope they let the cameras in
Lucky ass niggas don't got a chance to win
UH!

[Chorus: Junior Reid]

[Verse 3: French Montana]
I took over the streets go and tell 'em that
The chain cold as ice but I been through hell and back
You ain't got a buzz you just tipsy baby!
My bitch on E! like Chelsea Lately
Wildebeest, kill the streets
Metal on the Louis sneaks, top four back like movie seats
Short days long nights blood, sweat and tears
Rap was the gift bullet wounds was the souvenir
I guess comin' from the bottom feel way better
Truck for the winner get the drop for that Mayweather
Water brown hold it down like a angry great white
Take flight, hit the trap, break night
Many niggas got me twisted, gyros, lamb chops
I seen mills way before I knew Hancock
A dedication with the featured presentation
You fuckin' with the best nigga' deadly combination
MONTANA!

[Chorus: Junior Reid]
