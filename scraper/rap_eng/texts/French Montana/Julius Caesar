[Intro: French Montana]
Smoking on that Granddaddy like it's legal
Talk a hunnid cars, nigga Julius Caesar
Shawty hold it down, nigga she's a keeper
On my neck a hunnid thou', nigga Julius Caesar

[Verse 1: French Montana]
Came up out the block tryna make a dime
Then I bought the drop, every bitch die
Dirty money, all my nigga's slanging pot
Fully with them wheels that my gang got
If you talk about that bread, then make a move
Drink it to the head, feeling woozy
Young nigga balling, man I done told
Serving them the coke without the Cola
Getting money, blowing money, rich, I'm Porter
Gator shit like I played for Florida (HAAN)
I done cleared about 10 mill
And my chain about 10 bills (Bling)
Drink lean smoking marijuana
Worldcup Fifa watching Maradona

[Hook: French Montana]
Talk a hunnid cars, Julius Caesar
On my neck a hunnid thou', Julius Caesar
Talk a hunnid cars, Julius Caesar
On my neck a hunnid thou', Julius Caesar
Julius Caesar, Julius Caesar
Talk a hunnid cars, Julius Caesar
Julius Caesar, Julius Caesar
On my neck a hunnid thou', Julius Caesar

[Verse 2: French Montana]
Team full of shooters, we don't got a coach
Just a duffle bag with a lot of O's
All my niggas make movies
All them bitches be choosing
All them cars be tapped
All my nigga's ain't losing
They get it fresh up out the water
I might cook it on the yacht, on the water
Bad bitch get high, sophmore
Shawty need a sponsor tell her buy 4
Me and Mally Mall, Vegas night
Lost 200 on the same fight
Take 2 of these and take a flight
Fuck a photo shoot we do this every night

[Hook: French Montana]
