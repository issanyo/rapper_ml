[Hook]
Let me talk to you, darling
Your love is poison
Every time I talk to you, darling
It's like you shoot me glaciers
Let me talk to you, darling
Your love is poison
Let me talk to you, darling
Gotta pick your poison, gotta choose
Gotta make them choices, I maneuver
Whatever works, feel your soul nahmean?
I'm a new
Gotta pick your poison, gotta choose
Gotta make them choices, I'm a new
Whatever works, feel your soul nahmean?
I'm a new

[Verse 1]
Smokin' that poison, drinkin' that poison
Had to call them shots, had to make them choices
Had to hit that block, had to slang that poison
Had to hit that pot, couldn't sleep every night, I was hearin' them voices
Back to the wind, they ain't give me no choices
Left home with a dollar, drove back in a Royce
Your love is poison, made me do it
Thought if I stayed broke, you were blue
Just tryna make you stay, just tryna make your day
But the whole time you was poison to me
Trips to Vegas, whip the latest
Crib, the neighbors, they know you're poison, baby

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Ain't no poison can kill positive
Ain't no medicine can fix the negative
That envy fatal, pills and anger
Dust and poison, cross the line if you's a stranger
Woke up this morning, sometime
Woke up this morning with the Sun
I woke up this morning, sometime

[Outro]
You know what they say, ain't no mothafuckin' poison can kill a positive thinker. There ain't no mothafucka medicine that can cure a negative mothafucka thinker. Coke Boyz. Mac & Cheese, Appetizer
