(Verse 1: Boone)
Girl what's up with that nana
Pop a perc then I go nana
Free my boys in the slammer
All my niggas wild bandanas
Fuck Donald Trump and the bad cop too
A nigga rolled up I'mma show him what I do
357 (?) got the Mac 11
Hit your ass up nigga see you in heaven
(?) see my niggas in the corner
Hit the dice game til 4 in the morning
Real nigga shit fuck all that slang
Free Bobby Shmurda and the whole damn gang

(Verse 2: E-40)
My Boo straighted up like Whoopie
I got a damn bitch like cookie
Imma skrill nigga not a woosie
Your baby momma pussy hella gooshie
(?) Animal savagely with that action
They 'bout it they put your head on the chopping block, like a salad
If you get them past we woke and (?) might get dealt with (?)
I get off weight get push major keys like DJ Khaled
Flood that oil I'm perking I'm off this vodka and cream
I reach my pocket pull out the water and slap a hoe with my bands
When I'm on one don't fuck with me and I ain't gon' fuck with you
I put my foot in your ass size 15 shoe
Fucking around in the game I came from poverty man
I take flight like a plane and put the thump to your brain
I was making my change when Big Bird was a parent
Bugs Bunny had no teeth to eat a carrot

(Hook)
Pop a perc let it flow through my body
And let it flow through my body
Pop a perc let it flow through my body
My goddie, my goddie

(Bridge)
Poppin percs, doing dirt selling work
Throw a perc, in the club no shirt
Run up on me, shoot him like the old Dirk
And your baby momma that's my old work

(Verse 3: French Montana)
Round here they call me Montana
You ain't selling drugs nigga you a scammer
I heard you gotta a month for a hammer
I heard you told on some niggas from Atlanta
Shoutout my homie Max in the slammer
My young boy rob you on camera
Worldstar, big box with the banner
Imma shooter like Reggie, Indiana
You be smoking on that reggie with you (?)
I can see the future like I'm panda
Walk around your girl crib in my pijamas
I heard her nigga went broke, MC Hammer
In my far corner room I just stare at the wall
In the back of my mind I hear my conscious call
I need 10's, I need 30's, I need grams, I need birds
Perc after Percocet it ain't never to early

(Hook)
Pop a perc let it flow through my body
And let it flow through my body
Pop a perc let it flow through my body
My goddie, my goddie

(Bridge)
Poppin percs, doing dirt selling work
Throw a perc, in the club no shirt
Run up on me, shoot him like the old Dirk
And your baby momma that's my old work
