[Intro: Travis Scott]
Everything foreign, haha
Yeah

[Chorus: Travis Scott & Zoey Dollaz]
Hop out, hop out, gang, gang, gang
Pop two, pop three, then we bang
Rambo, Lambo' when I slide
Come through, pop out, please don't riot
Nah-nah, nah-nah, you can't hang
Come through, run through, gang, gang, gang
Rambo, Lambo' when I slide
Creep through (yeah, Zoey Dollaz), drop-top, I can't hide

[Verse 1: Zoey Dollaz & Travis Scott]
Okay, hop out, pop out (yeah)
Range Rover, put a hole in a nigga like a bagel
Bad bitch, with me, skin-tone
Main goal: take flight, vacate turf (vroom)
Day goes: jump off the jet, big-boy Draco (woo)
Expensive taste, who she got a taste for? (for)
Dominican mama, she call me Zoey Peso (try again)
Chain Wayne Gretzky, on skate oh, yeah
We don't really cuff these hoes, yeah
I don't keep up these hoes, yeah (yeah)
Caught up chasin' this dope, yeah (yeah)
I don't even fuck these hoes
Lambo (Lambo), Bruce Wayne (Bruce Wayne)
Treat hoes (treat hoes) like loose change (like loose change)
Spent five bands on Palm Angels
My kick-game (woo) on Liu Kang (yah)

[Chorus: Travis Scott]
Hop out, hop out, gang, gang, gang
Pop two, pop three, then we bang
Rambo, Lambo' when I slide
Come through, pop out, please don't riot
Nah-nah, nah-nah, you can't hang
Come through, run through, gang, gang, gang
Rambo, Lambo' when I slide
Creep through, drop-top, I can't hide

[Verse 2: French Montana]
...

[Chorus: Travis Scott]
Hop out, hop out, gang, gang, gang
Pop two, pop three, then we bang
Rambo, Lambo' when I slide
Come through, pop out, please don't riot
Nah-nah, nah-nah, you can't hang
Come through, run through, gang, gang, gang
Rambo, Lambo' when I slide
Creep through, drop-top, I can't hide
