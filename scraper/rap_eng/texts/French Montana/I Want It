Good Morning
Rise and Shine

[Hook:]
Better tell that bitch I want it
No time for the playa Im hot Im drunk I want it
I want it, henny in my cup, purple everywhere
Shorty let me fuck, dogging everywhere
Better tell that bitch I am on it

My pops was a rolling stone, now Im stoned rolling
I go to sleep drunk, we wake up fuck all morning
Show that to them people, Im fresh Im fly my diamonds see through
I know you are tired, wasting time, fuck a nigga lies they feed you
Now playas gonna crunk my niggers gonna get high you know Im drunk
Shawty look fly, you know I dunk
Coke Boy tape, all I bump
Look at that drop, look at how I peel
Look at them tires, look at them wheels
Look at that ass, look at them heels
My eyes wide, yours on the pill
Look at the how we corner the market
Got the game all locked right under the umpet
New Crib, new order of carpet
My niggas got locked up I lost it
That New York city we bought it back
Shawty head crazy, I taught her that
You know we going hard, no falling back

[Hook:]
Better tell that bitch I want it
No time for the playa Im hot Im drunk I want it

When it comes to, "How much you pay the most"
Drop that top like Amber Rose
My nigga Chinx Drugs keep the hammer close
Alphabet boys I fear the most
I dropped that bread, and I coped that
Coke Boy Team, now stop that
I ride that drop, with the top back
That hammer kick back, like a hot hat
You know that work we serve out
Let the blocks put the word out
Drink that Hen, smoke burn out
Look how lil momma turn out
She know a nigga want it
She know a nigga on it
She know a nigga dead, off that head
Faded, most hated
Killers on the street ok'd it
Gotch yo bitch, now say it
Watch niggas flop, now weighted
Now get up on my level, diamonds on my bazzle
Fresh up out the ghetto, HELLO

[Hook:]
Better tell that bitch I want it
No time for the playa Im hot Im drunk I want it

Shorty let me fuck, dogging everywhere
Better tell that bitch I am on it

Baby I'm all the way, like
Them niggas say they ballin, they lie
In the game, spending change, when comes to due's niggas pay mine
Co-Co-Coke Boy, juiced up
Im on the drink, yellow diamond lane
Shitting on these niggas, ya nigga hold the bank
Stash box up in a G ride
Bad bitch with me, she's slide
I spend niggers money three times
Cash out before a nigga eat mine
Shorty know I am on it so she fucked me good
Slide with the homies bet she fucking would

[Hook:]
Better tell that bitch I want it

[Waka Flocka]
I love it when my girls gay, you can call me marvin
Give them a sexual healing, my dick Im parking
Then reverse out of bed like I got to go
"Where the fuck my money nigga", Im like hold up ho
Don"t confuse me with no mother fucking banjo
THROW DEM BANDS HOE, THROW DEM-THROW DEM BANDS HOE
See my left wrist froze, see my necklace froze
See my right wrist froze, I got dough ho
I just wanna fuck, baby girl you a nut
Real thick finger in the butt, suck it like a slut
Little momma I want it, so bring it here
Im gonna beat that pussy, I dont give a fuck who cares

[Hook:]
Better tell that bitch I want it
