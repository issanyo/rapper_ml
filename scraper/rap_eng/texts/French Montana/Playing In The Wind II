[Hook]
All my niggas fly high, we playin' in the wind
All my niggas fly high, we playin' in the wind
All my niggas fly high, we playin' in the wind
All my niggas flyin' high, we playin' in the wind

[Verse]
Frank Lucas or Blake Griffin
St. Thomas or San Quentin
Trips to Puerto Rico or that Rico law
Packs in the hallway at Seton Hall
Paranoid, yeah the streets talk
Got me swimmin' with the Desert, man, seahawk
I be swervin', got a hundred thousand in my denim
And we can talk about these crabs for dinner
Pop them pills, smokin' dank, drinkin' lean too
Got me runnin' through the fire with gasoline suit
All eyes, closed mouth
Fake friends, lost ties, mob ties
Courtside, climb fences, barbed wires
Bars wired, been ballin', Karlton Hines
Whispers in the dark give you cold heart
Kill the ink, paid in full, Eric B
Rakim Allah, say a prayer doin' bad or good
Buy the charts, can't buy the hood
Wiggle in the paint, boulders in the link
Welker with the bank, piranhas in the tank
Shorty want me back
Was the best she ever had

[Hook]
