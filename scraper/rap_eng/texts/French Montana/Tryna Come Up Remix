[Hook: Nino Brown]
I’m doing my thang, pockets on full
Bitch I’m super clean, bitches gone look
Yeah you know
Bitch I’m tryina come up, bitch I’m tryina come up
Bitch I’m tryina come up, bitch I’m tryina come up
Sipping on lean, smoking on kush
Pockets full of green, selling george bush
Yeah you know
Bitch I’m tryina come up, bitch I’m tryina come up
Bitch I’m tryina come up, bitch I’m tryina come up

[Verse 1: Nino Brown]
Talking bout what you gonn do, jump bad if you want to
Loading up my fire, watch it burn the flesh when it go through
Niggas talk like hoes do, we’ll slap them hoes too
We don’t fuck with them fuck niggas
Ungrateful and unloyal
My bitches spoiled, 20 stacks in the louie bag
No red and blue and no gang bang, louie parts in my louie rag
Leave em all, popping tags, out of line, I pop your ass
Gased up, chevron, that ak will stop your ass
Counting cash I’m getting money, near a nigga can’t take it from me
He broke and hungry, my pockets full
Look clean and I’m smoking good

[Hook]

[Verse 2: French Montana]
Bitch I’m tryina come up, 100 chains all on my stomach
Niggas did it ..we done done it, and your main bitch I don’t want her
100 clip you hear that thunder, 100 years when niggas fumble
100 bitches what we come through, 100 bottles until I stumble
I be pimping like I want to, nigga slipping he’s a goner
Niggas hungry, I drove out that dealer masi, doing donuts, catch a lick
And I blow it, I pimp them hoes like a poet
I smoke that kush like I grow it
Hit the strip, it was snowing, it’s that We The Best Coke Boys
Hammers making no noise, give niggas 2 choice
Come up or die

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Yo Gotti]
Shout out to Khaled, we the best, we-we-we be getting money, you looking stressed
YMCMG, salute to Stunna, 4 words bitch I’m tryna come up
Dead to hold a hunna, any nigga run up, they get done up off the come up
My life is Obama, I’m so presidential, you so sentimental
Your bitch she got potential, and I’m so influential
Hold up, these Nikes cost 2 grand, these shades cost 5 bands
These niggas I mob with, I sold dope and I rob with
CMG my squad thick, see how hard my squad hit
305 we clicked up, man on 1 that mob shit, yeah

[Hook]

[Verse 4: Ace Hood]
Getting this money I never do sleep, 100k I make that in a week
25,000 I hop on the beat, top of the whip so you know that it’s me
Balling nigga like Spalding, sipping that good
Whatchamacallit, remember them nights, mama was calling out in them streets
Gotta be cautious, niggas are plied, running your spot
Hit a young boy when he’s getting that guap
Fuck them niggas, look at my wrist, oh you mad, take your bitch
I’m in that ghost, holy shit, stayed in the ground and it got me rich
Stayed in the ground and it got me rich, got me rich, yeah got me rich
I say bitch I’m tryna come up, out here till' the sun up
Crib cost a mill, my watch another hundred

[Outro: Nino Brown]
Bitch I'm tryna come up. bitch I'm tryna come up
Bitch I'm tryna come up, Bitch I'm tryna come up
