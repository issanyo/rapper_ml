Chris What's happening

[Verse 1: French Montana]
I be riding with the ???
Shawty on the ???
Puffing on the purple, slipping with juice getting sticky
And her friend in her ear, hes a dog, he's a freak, he got a different girl everyday of the week
I be cruising with my lady, niggas acting shady
The cut of the crew, how the fuck we gon' lose (hann)
Got the boat on the water, Lam on cruise
You gon' need a stamp for them shoes
Keys to the crib, let her push the wheel
We started from the bottom, now at the top of the heaters
California love, Coke boy, Coke boy
I know you heard of us, Montana

[Verse 2: Chris Echols]
She a good girl
Let her spend my money
Let her drive my cars
She always ride it for me
I'm ma keep it G, ain't with that lovey dovey
But every time I see her, I'm like love me, love me, love me
She even hold it down, right her for a while
Living in the clouds, cause I'm on loud
Undercover freak, she be getting wild
Like a jack boy, I tell her, lay down

[Hook]
I'm spend it all on you girl (I spend it all on you girl, you girl)
To see your dreams come true girl (to see your dreams come true girl, true girl)
Your friends say he a dog, he a freak, he got a different girl every day of the week
Spend 'em racks on you, tell 'em hoes talk shit
Tell them worry 'bout their man, don't worry about me

[Hook]
Cause I just wanna see you, I just wanna see you
I just wanna see you smile (smile)
Baby, baby, I just wanna see you, I just wanna see you
I just wanna see you smile (smile)
Baby, you been riding with me for a while
Do it all for you, just wanna see you smile (I just wanna see you smile)
Baby, baby, I just I just wanna see you, I just wanna see you
I just wanna see you smile babe

[Verse 3: Chris Echols]
You can have it all, meet at the bank
Pretty like your momma, wetter than my paint
Overseas flights, tiara on your ???
Niggas trying to holla and she be looking stank
YSL logo, never tell me no, no
We the perfect photo, living by the Y.O.L.O
Thang so good, I gotta hit her with the slow flow
Cause she be trying to speed up, and I'll be screaming oh no

[Hook & Hook]

[Bridge: Chris Echols]
And you don't ever have to leave
I'll provide your every need
I just wanna see your dreams come true
Let's take over the world baby, me plus you
Hoes will wipe you down
Hoes will wipe you down
Love, love thinking about you even when you're not around
Love, love how you scream ahh when I put it down
Ride, ride for me girl, I'mma put you in a gown

[Hook: Chris Echols]
