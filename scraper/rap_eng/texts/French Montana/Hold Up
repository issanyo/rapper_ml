[Intro: French Montana]
I ain't never gon' come through when you niggas call
I'ma come through when I want, hol' up!
Hol' up, hol' up

[Chorus: French Montana & Quavo]
Tell 'em niggas hol' up, hol' up, hol' up, hol' up (ayy)
Tell 'em niggas hol' up, hol' up (ayy)
I ain't rushin' with the work
I'm comin' with the work any time that I wanna (ayy)
Wait a minute, wait a minute (hol' up)
Tell 'em niggas hol' up (ayy)
Wait a minute, wait a minute (hol' up)
Comin' when I wanna (ayy)

[Post-Chorus: French Montana]
Knicks game, floor seat right next to Spike (woo, ayy)
I throw two lines in a 20 ounce Sprite

[Verse 1: French Montana & Quavo]
For my nerves, I'm pourin' up
Knees in the water
Some freaks in the foreign
In the V like the quarter (hol' up)
(Hol' up, hol' up, hol' up, hol' up)
Mixin' that Ciroc, bad bitches all night (hol' up)
I don't care what they doin', man, I'm doin' what I like
Tell them niggas hol' up, hol' up (hol' up)
From the bottom, feelin' mad (woo)
Hol' up, hol' up
Where them niggas at when we started from bottom?
Wait a minute, wait a minute (hol' up)
Wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute (ayy)
Wait a minute, crib got the elevators in it (woo)
Wait a minute, now I'm buyin' hotels

[Chorus: French Montana & Quavo]
Tell 'em niggas hol' up, hol' up, hol' up, hol' up (ayy)
Tell 'em niggas hol' up, hol' up (hol' up, ayy)
I ain't rushin' with the work
I'm comin' with the work any time that I wanna (ayy)
Wait a minute, wait a minute (hol' up)
Tell 'em niggas hol' up (ayy)
Wait a minute, wait a minute (hol' up)
Comin' when I wanna (ayy)

[Post-Chorus: French Montana & Quavo]
Knicks game, floor seat right next to Spike (woo, ayy)
I throw two lines in a 20 ounce Sprite

[Verse 2: Quavo]
(Quavo)
When I pull out the chopper, every nigga on sight (hol' up, rahh)
In the trap catchin' plays, OG, Jerry Rice (OG, ugh)
When you a millionaire, you do not care 'bout the price (M&Ms, millionaire)
You play with my money, know niggas will come take your life

[Verse 3: Chris Brown & Quavo]
Baby, that pussy too crazy, put me to sleep like a baby
I like to smoke with Jamaicans
Sak pase to all my Haitians
Pussy be tight with the Asians
I like Malaysians, I like to fuck
I like to get it, eat that pussy up
I know that she get excited when I get inside it
Ride my pony, giddy up (ayy)

[Verse 3: Takeoff]
Lil' bitch don't know me, need to hold up (nah)
If you got the cookies, you need to roll up (yeah)
Double cup, I'm sippin' on purple, not Minnesota
Diamonds on my neck, I'm sick, I done caught ebola (bleh)
My niggas from the bando trappin' off a Motorola
Dabbin' on these bitches, when they see me call me Casanova (dab)
Don't mention that when I'm pourin' a soda
Keep the pocket rocket for the cobras tryna take it over (rahh)
(Takeoff)

[Chorus: French Montana & Quavo]
Tell 'em niggas hol' up, hol' up, hol' up, hol' up (ayy)
Tell 'em niggas hol' up, hol' up (hol' up, ayy)
I ain't rushin' with the work
I'm comin' with the work any time that I wanna (ayy)
Wait a minute, wait a minute (hol' up)
Tell 'em niggas hol' up (ayy)
Wait a minute, wait a minute (hol' up)
Comin' when I wanna (ayy)

[Post-Chorus: French Montana & Quavo]
Knicks game, floor seat right next to Spike (woo, ayy)
I throw two lines in a 20 ounce Sprite

[Chorus: French Montana & Quavo]
Tell 'em niggas hol' up, hol' up, hol' up, hol' up (ayy)
Tell 'em niggas hol' up, hol' up (hol' up, ayy)
I ain't rushin' with the work
I'm comin' with the work any time that I wanna (ayy)
Wait a minute, wait a minute (hol' up)
Tell 'em niggas hol' up (ayy)
Wait a minute, wait a minute (hol' up)
Comin' when I wanna (ayy)

[Post-Chorus: French Montana & Quavo]
Knicks game, floor seat right next to Spike (woo, ayy)
I throw two lines in a 20 ounce Sprite (woo)
