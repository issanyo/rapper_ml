Just like what I said
Baby my baby baby my baby my baby

[Hook]
You don't wanna fuck with me I let em go
Tunnel vision on the money I don't see the ho
I guess I am slow so they always catch me
Imma live it up pop bottles flick it up
Some bitches still my niggas behind the wall
Tell em I ain't slowing down I want it all
I am on the edge till them niggas catch me
I ma live it up pop bottles flick it up

[Verse 1 : French Montana]
Fuck a star I am an astronaut
Baby gon grab a shot
Know I'm tryna slide like rap-alot
Blown back half a block
Trick I'd rather not
I am from the hood baby I ain't always had alot
And wake up in the morning
Than look up in the ceiling
Another day up in the jungle
On my way up to the million
Lightning up the cig than
Sippin on that lean
Nigga tryna make a killin
Homie nothin in between
Shawty dump me to the morning
Wake up and go to the church
Tryna wash away your sins I guess whatever work
Keep a hammer fucking time
These niggas getting murkd
Coke Boys on the grind
From the first to the first
Montana

[Hook]
You don't wanna fuck with me I let em go
Tunnel vision on that money I don't see the ho
I guess I am slow said he will always catch me
I ma live it up pop bottles flick it up
Some bitches still my niggas's behind the wall
Tell em I ain't slowing down Nah no at all
I am on the edge till the Niggas catch me
I ma live it up pop bottles flick it up

[Verse 2 : Chinx Drugz]
That nigga head up to the sky
Feet on solid grizzale
Haters won't knock me
Off my sway swear I am too rizzale
Hall of Fame bizzale
Perstigious with this hustlin player
Hurry up and stop breathing do yourself the favor
Before I toss the shakers
I kiss em up to God
I know he don't condone gambling but this life is hard
See this life of ours
Cold nights of brawls
Whippin white in yalls
Twirling in the nicest cars
Nigga I'm flyer than I ever been
Anyting that these niggas confess to be I never been
All about my presidents
Imma set the precedents
Tailor made flow
These rappers don't match these measurements
Nahh
Gram still over the stove mixing
Out of these up and coming I'm the most prolific
Chinx drugz get familiar with the name bitchez
When they think they figure me out
That's when my lane switches

[Hook]
You don't wanna fuck with me I let em go
Tunnel visions on the money I don't see the ho
I guess I am slow said he will always catch me
I ma live it up pop bottles flick it up
Some bitches still my niggas's behind the wall
Tell em I ain't slowing down Nah no at all
I am on the edge till the Niggas catch me
I ma live it up pop bottles flick it up
