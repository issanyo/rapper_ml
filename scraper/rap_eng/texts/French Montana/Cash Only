[Verse 1: French Montana]
Thousand chain Frenchie Kodak
Want my flow back
Bullets hit cha call him mister never get ya ho back
100 grams I throw that
And yo bitch I stole that
Bitches pray to the wave true religion throw back
Got the streets you know that
That respect you owe that
Paying fold to the hov cuz my niggas grow that
Foot on niggas neck, serving niggas coke
Cross iced out like you seen him with the pope
Fuck the beef cook and steak up
All that grind got to cake up
Get so high might never wake up
Put it in a pop break the brick up
Chunky on the leg, shot my nigga trae
Wild safari in the closet nigga fuck a Mink
I'm a product of that product in a pot
Hole hit you from the roof turn ya cope to a drop road
Montanna dave distribute like Fontana spray like All in for da tray ,Coke

[Hook]
Never get ya ho back, 100 grams I throw that X3
Work Work Work Work Work.. Twerk Bitch

[Verse 2]
Hateing on me, its all good
Funk niggas, its all good
Lay it down, send her home, she got a man but she told me its all good
Overtime, its all good
Weekends, its all good
Eating Foie Gras Drinking white wine, trust me its all good
Damn Juda that boy really trying to skyscrape
Throw it in play to win, coldgame high stakes
Annihilating competition, dope dilate your vision
Niggas hibernate im wide awake so fuck you pay attention
Enviroment im living kinda shady but I risen
Parifornia with my niggas, somewhere foreign trying to get it
I hustle smarter not harder I donâ€™t need a sponsor
Dope Uncut like a virgin, Pre Madonna
