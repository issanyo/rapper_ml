[Intro/Outro: Manolo Rose]
Fuck, you niggas talking money?
Why the fuck you niggas talking money?
Fuck, you niggas talking money?
You broke niggas talking money?

[Pre-Hook: Manolo Rose]
I’m a different kinda nigga
Coke dealer my profession
Thousand dollar salad dressing
We call that super flexin'
Fuck your fives, tens, and twenties
Niggas counting hundreds!
Fuck your fives, tens, and twenties
Niggas counting hundreds!

[Hook: Manolo Rose] (x2)
I’m a different kinda nigga
Coke dealer my profession
Thousand dollar salad dressing
We call that super flexin'

[Verse 1: Manolo Rose]
Got the shit for the low, hope the shit get across
Nigga counting all his blessings, thousand dollar salad dressing
Call that super flexin', in that pussy getting bored
We call that pussy export, we call that pussy export
All my niggas getting money, all my niggas getting money
All my niggas getting money, all my niggas getting money
How can I lose when the Bible open on the book of Psalms, chapter 82
Verse 6, all ye are gods and all ye are children of the Most High?!
Whoo! No weapons, just we shall prosper
Hundred round drum sound like an opera
You gon' need six hail marys
Couple humdulilahs and two fucking witch doctors

[Pre-Hook] + [Hook]

[Verse 2: French Montana]
Made my first hundred off the blow
Then I made my first mill with Ross
Now you catch me with Diddy flexin'
From the South Bronx countin' up my blessings
Montana be the king of the slow flow
'Fore I bagged Coco, bagged coco
All black Maybach through the block
In the back, me, Diddy and Sanaa
Just had to just see my nigga Chinx drop
All-black, off-white with the mink top
44 to your three-quarter tank top
Real niggas still pull up by Frank shop
Chapter 37, 357
157, hit you with 7
Crack up your rib, lift up your melon
Take off your ski mask and turn into dressing
Hit a nigga with my window closed
And go lay up where the window blow
Mixing pills, mixing liquor
I'm a different kinda nigga, haaannn!

[Pre-Hook] + [Hook]
