[Mixtape Intro: DJ Drama & French Montana]
Ever been cheated on before? (Hey)
Can't even tell you about my experience (Montana!)
Shh, Neighbourhood, maybe you can describe it a little better for me
(Ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay)
French, what up?

[Verse 1: Jesse Rutherford]
Just got cheated on, no it's not my day
That's not my bitch, she's not my girl, she's not my bae
My stomach's in pain
I hope I don't throw up all over what you told
But it hurts me to know

[Pre-Chorus: Jesse Rutherford]
I can't even, I can't even believe what you did to me
You can't even, you can't even say I'm overreacting
I can't even, can't even hear your side
Shame on me, you fooled me twice
And you said I wasn't just like anyone, like
But you treated me just like everyone, like everyone else

[Chorus: Jesse Rutherford]
You like to say that you're right
Did it make you feel bad
When you cheated on your man last night? (Woop!)
Did I even ever cross your mind?
You like to say that you're right
Did it make you feel bad
When you cheated on your man last night? (Woop!)
Did I even ever cross your mind?
You like to say that you're ri—
You like to say that you're right

[Verse 2: French Montana]
(Montana! Hey)
Drop head, winter time, hoodie all mink (Mink)
Bought a hundred chains now the bitches all linger (Linger)
Walk by the crib, smell the kitchen all stanky (Stank)
Floor seats, 4 quarter, spent a quarter on the link (Woo!)
Ridin' through Philly, Meek Milly, double R (Still rich)
Still ridin' through the strip catchin' licks with my dog
30 for the whole, 15 for the half (Eh)
You could break it down, come and see me with the bag (Ay)
Shorty fell in love with a young rich nigga
Blunt full of smoke and a cup full of liquor
Say what I mean and I mean what I said baby
Silk sheets, I be slippin' off the bed baby

[Pre-Chorus: Jesse Rutherford]
I can't even, I can't even believe what you did to me
You can't even, you can't even say I'm overreacting
I can't even, can't even hear your side
Shame on me, you fooled me twice
And you said I wasn't just like anyone, like
But you treated me just like everyone, like everyone else

[Chorus: Jesse Rutherford]
You like to say that you're right
Did it make you feel bad
When you cheated on your man last night? (Woop!)
Did I even ever cross your mind?
You like to say that you're right
Did it make you feel bad
When you cheated on your man last night? (Woop!)
Did I even ever cross your mind?
You like to say that you're ri—
You like to say that you're right
