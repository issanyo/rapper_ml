[Hook: French Montana & Maino]
Hustle hard, back in the house once again
Coke boys, back in the house once again
Hustle hard, back in the house once again
Coke boys, back in the house once again
Drop a gem on 'em, back in the house once again
Hustle hard, back in the house once again
Drop a gem on 'em, back in the house once again
Coke boys, back in the house once again
Drop a gem on 'em

[Verse 1: French Montana]
Niggas actin like it ain't something new to you
Crack a TV on your head, break the news to you
I be hoppin out the ghost, five chains dangling
Got niggas shaking like the crab table
Slept on a nigga, woke the the city up
Used to break down work, now I throw a milli up
Let them niggas talk watch what I do
Bunch a internet thugs homie, yahoo
Bow down you niggas strawberry shortcake
We're here to stay, your career was a short stay
44 check, clear port jet
Me and Maino with them K's at your door step

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Maino]
I got this, niggas get punished for tryna stop this
Big chains down to my dick, easy to spot this
Chicks come from all different cities to try to and watch this
Monster, beat niggas bloody. Homie the lochness
Cups up, toast to the life. Baby we bout that
Bitch gave me head for days, she wanna mouth that
Doubt that. This niggas really ready to test me
Rook move capture your queen, you couldn't check me
Bless me, screaming out Brooklyn. I'm sure they heard me
Look boy, celebrity chicks bow down and serve me
Weak niggas hang in they cells, pass them the road boy
Maino husltin hard like I'm a coke boy

[Hook]
