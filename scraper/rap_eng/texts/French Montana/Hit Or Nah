[Intro: Keyshia Cole & French Montana]
Yeah, what up Rayven
Left stroke be the best stroke
It's your girl Keyshia Cole in the building
NY to the back, Montana
You know what it is every time your hear that haaaan
Every time I hear what

[Chorus: Rayven Justice]
Can I fuck or nah? I wanna get with you
I wanna get them draws, I wanna show you summin'
Come with me, girl don't be scared
I wanna show you sumthin' right over here
Can I fuck or nah?

[Verse 1: Rayven Justice]
Girl don't be shy, I wanna see what you about
I'm staring at your thighs, you about to go down
Come dance with me, come grind on me
Shake that ass for a G, I'm just sayin'
Stop playin' wit a young nigga, let me show you what you missin'
You have never had nothin' different, fuckin with the nigga, nigga

[Pre-Chorus]
Baby you're somethin' else, I'm just sayin'
I just don't understand why you're playin'

[Chorus: Rayven Justice]
Can I fuck or nah? I wanna get with you
I wanna get them draws, I wanna show you summin'
Come with me, girl don't be scared
I wanna show you sumthin' right over here
Can I fuck or nah?

Shawty got me open
Take her to the crib I'm a raider like Oakland
San Fran call me Joe Montana

Shoulda play pro in Atlanta
Flow on steroids, A-Rod
I'mma hit and run like State Farm
Say she 'bout whatever, so what we doin' ?
She woke up in the kitchen like Martin Stewart
She wanna pop it like my old single
Start throwin' up some more singles
I’mma regulate, Nate Dogg
Black diamonds like Akon

[Verse 2: Keyshia Cole]
Why you over here doing too much baby, anyway
I'm at the same place at the same time
So don't try me with the [?]
I know you heard about, how I keep it one hunnid
So keep playing around, you gon' miss our song
Ooh la la la
Tlaking bout can you hit or nah, you better relax baby
Ooh la la la, la la, la, la la la la la la

[Pre-Chorus: Rayven Justice & Keyshia Cole]
Baby you're somethin' else, I'm just sayin'
I just don't understand why you're playin'

[Chorus: Rayven Justice]
Can I fuck or nah? I wanna get with you
I wanna get them draws, I wanna show you summin'
Come with me, girl don't be scared
I wanna show you sumthin' right over here
Can I fuck or nah?

[Verse 3: French Montana]
Shawty got me open
Take her to the crib I'm a raider like Oakland
San Fran call me Joe Montana
Braid shoulda play pro in Atlanta
Flow on steroids, A-Rod
I'mma hit and run like State Farm
Say she 'bout whatever, so what we doin' ?
She woke up in the kitchen like Martha Stewart
She wanna pop it like my old single
Start throwin' up some more singles

Black diamonds like Akon

[Pre-Chorus: Rayven Justice & Keyshia Cole]
Baby you're somethin' else, I'm just sayin'
