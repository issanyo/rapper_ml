[Chorus]
I think I love her (love her, love her, love her, love her)
Tryna meet her mutha (mutha, mutha, mutha, mutha)
Doggin with no rubber (rubber, rubber, rubber, rubber)
Shes a movie, got that magic box, got a nigga going stupid X2

[Verse 1]
She's a money train, we be runnin thangs
Shorty down to ride, trust her with a hundred thangs
If ya money gone, go wit it
Thats the first thing, talk about that real kitty on the backs just her and me
Shorty, ride or die and I can dig it, she be ready
Homie everytime she call I know she talkin bout that fetti
I let her push the drop, I be shot gun wit it
Bout 30 on my wrist, and my neck 150
Coupe stupid low, and I be stupid high
Cup full of yack lean, call me super fly
Im talkin Louis 13, money be the first thing
Hello, Im ballin like Melo

[Chorus]
I think I love her (love her, love her, love her, love her)
Tryna meet her mutha (mutha, mutha, mutha, mutha)
Doggin with no rubber (rubber, rubber, rubber, rubber)
Shes a movie, got that magic box, got a nigga going stupid X2

[Chorus]
I'm talkin' Louis 13, money be the first thing
Hello, Im ballin like Melo
Shorty from the ghetto

Pull them things out, have it lookin like a movie

Hustlin I was skinny, now got that money belly

I got a stupid knot, you know we stupid hot
A hundred thou lick, thats a stupid drop

[Chorus]
I think I love her (love her, love her, love her, love her)
Tryna meet her mutha (mutha, mutha, mutha, mutha)
Doggin with no rubber (rubber, rubber, rubber, rubber)
Shes a movie, got that magic box, got a nigga going stupid
I think I love her (love her, love her, love her, love her)
Tryna meet her mutha (mutha, mutha, mutha, mutha)
Doggin with no rubber (rubber, rubber, rubber, rubber)
Shes a movie, got that magic box, got a nigga going stupid
