[Hook: Ray J]
Hey love - I see you rolling in your 500 Benz
Hey love - and girl, I got a homie for each one of your friends
Hey love - hey love, hey love, hey love, hey love, hey love
Hey love - hey love, hey love, hey love, hey love, hey love
Hey love

[Verse 1: Ray J]
Baby, tell me what it's gon' be
You got your girls with you and I got my homies
So you're trying to spend your money, girl, won't let me treat
For the night, for the night, yeah
Baby, I ain't one of those lames
And spending money ain't a part of my game
Switching lanes - wondering how you gon' say my name
It's only right, it's only right, yeah
Your hair long, you got bankrolls so you ain't got no worries
So would you come and turn it up with me?

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Tyga]
I've been watching you from a far
For as long as I remember, you remember those Boulevards?
Dice game, hustle hard - it was more like volleyball
Long hair, Hollywood, but still kept it hood though
Crenshaw riding cars, knew you'd be a superstar
Days in the maze, we so high, upper echelon
Eye contact, caress, is you with?
I ain't had a crush in years, saying:

[Hook]

[Verse 3: French Montana]
It started at the ruck, I saw you with your man
Smiling, huh, Birkin bag in your hand
Trying to work it out very day thinking 'bout you
Pull up in the Mulsanne, you pull up in the coupe
Hoping shawty 'bout it, you want it then I got it
She don't buy no shoes if the price tag ain't got no comets
Tried to keep my cool, all white Jimmy Choo's
Dress drop to the floor, let me get you in the mood
G5 through the stone, baby, don't be getting scared
20 racks on your bag, 5 racks on your hair
Until then I'mma lay up in the cut
Montana, Ray J, you know what's up

[Hook]
