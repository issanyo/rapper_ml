[Intro: French Montana]
Migos, Montana
Get your roll on (Yo!)
Young nigga get your roll on (Commando!)
Haah!

[Chorus: Quavo]
Know some niggas on my team play with yayo
I just point at you they shoot you on commando
I know niggas pop and roll no Fabo
I got Molly, I got white, OJ Mayo
Young nigga get your roll on
Young nigga, young nigga, get your roll on
Young nigga get your roll on
Young nigga, young nigga, get your roll on

[Verse 1: Quavo]
Young rich nigga, get my roll on
Then I take the pot and turn the stove on
Skrr! Skrr! Cook a brick with my gold on
All that damn water Quavo made a thunderstorm
They call me Quavo Ken Nugent
The birds I get it, I move it
The gas is lookin' like mucus
Young Quavo-Frank Lucas
I'm makin' a movie, Migo 3 stooges, bricks in the doolie
I'm calling the plug I juug the finesse and his ass for the cutie

[Chorus: Quavo]
Know some niggas on my team play with yayo

I know niggas pop and roll no Fabo
I got Molly, I got white, OJ Mayo
Young nigga get your roll on
Young nigga, young nigga, get your roll on
Young nigga get your roll on
Young nigga, young nigga, get your roll on

[Verse 2 : French Montana]
Every nigga 'round my hood servin' yayo
Why you think that con crib is payed for?
All I got is doe paper
Bad bitch with no make up
Crib it got no neighbors
Now I need no favors
Stackin' up this money
Niggas never took none from me
Ain't no car-jack, extorsion
That fuckery get a car fine
Rollie on my wrist
Michael Corleone with them bricks
Get my roll on my niggas
Better hold on your bitch

[Chorus: Quavo]
Know some niggas on my team play with yayo
I just point at you they shoot you on commando
I know niggas pop and roll no Fabo
I got Molly, I got white, OJ Mayo
Young nigga get your roll on
Young nigga, young nigga, get your roll on
Young nigga get your roll on
Young nigga, young nigga, get your roll on

[Verse 3: Takeoff]
The trap house I'm holding, you niggas is folding
I'm striking these hoes like I'm bowling
Now niggas hit a ticket for a picture
My money too big it ain't folding
Can't play Anquan Boldin
Leanin' I'm told that it's golden like tokens
I'm sippin on codeine, I'm sellin' that white
That Mary and Ashley, that Zack and that Cody
I ain't got to roll it but them niggas still rolling
[?] brawlin', the Bentley is loaded
She's smoking on Cookie lil' mama she's choking
Fabo she rollin' my pack (yeah she rollin)
Rollin'! Rollin'! Rollin'!
Boot up! Boot up! Boot up!
Milwaukee you know I got bucks
Benjamins older than chucks

[Chorus: Quavo]
Know some niggas on my team play with yayo
I just point at you they shoot you on commando
I know niggas pop and roll no Fabo
I got Molly, I got white, OJ Mayo
Young nigga get your roll on
Young nigga, young nigga, get your roll on
Young nigga get your roll on
Young nigga, young nigga, get your roll on
