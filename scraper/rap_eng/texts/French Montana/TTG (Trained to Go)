[Chorus: Waka Flocka Flame]
All my niggas TTG, they trained to go, shawty
Kick a door, shawty, lay down on the floor, shawty
Trained to go, shawty, I'm all about that fucking bread
Robbed so many niggas, I got a ticket on my head
All my niggas TTG, they trained to go, shawty
Kick a door, shawty, lay down on the floor, shawty
Trained to go, shawty, I'm all about that fucking bread
Robbed so many niggas, I got a ticket on my head

[Verse 1: Waka Flocka Flame]
New boy on the block, so you know my pistol jerking
You got weed, soft, or pills, fucker, is you working?
Bank account hurting, so you know a nigga robbing
Don't got a job, they finished school, so what's the option?
Lay that nigga down, AK or that 40 round
Pills and weed got me higher than Bobby Brown (Rollin')
T.T.G. hoe, trained to go, hoe
Lay down on the floor or bring it to the door, hoe

[Verse 2: French Montana]
All my niggas in this city trained to go, shawty
I got a old 40 with like four bodies on it
Twerk, putting niggas in the dirt
Any means necessary, make her work
Montana got that twerk, twerk, twerk, 35 for the shirt
If you need a nigga, hit me on the Chirp
And you know I got that dough, shawty
I be pimping, got them bitches on the go, shawty
I'ma shooter like Chris Paul

[Chorus: Waka Flocka Flame]
All my niggas TTG, they trained to go, shawty
Kick a door, shawty, lay down on the floor, shawty
Trained to go, shawty, I'm all about that fucking bread
Robbed so many niggas, I got a ticket on my head
All my niggas TTG, they trained to go, shawty
Kick a door, shawty, lay down on the floor, shawty
Trained to go, shawty, I'm all about that fucking bread
Robbed so many niggas, I got a ticket on my head

[Verse 3: YG Hootie]
Bitch, we hitting licks, find me when you found me
I ain't finished school, grinding with my Tommy
.45, that's my blondie, that's my bitch nigga
I'm from West Side Bompton, that's my blick, nigga
Me and Flockaveli, bitch, I'm sensing like I'm Belly
They be by my celly, flip them bitches at the telly
Trained to go, nigga, I rob a nigga
Straight drag a nigga, that's your ass, nigga

[Verse 4: Joe Moses]
What they know about me? All black mask and a all black tee
All black bitch in the all black V, out in the A with Waka Flocka
French Montana got that blocka blocka
Twenty all out on that talk-a-Flocka
Flag on the right, that's su woo, bitch
I don't give a fuck about what you did
J-O-E, I run this shit
Hootie and Joe, that's the Brick Squad West
Shooting for the head, you can wear your vest
Tat on my chest, I rep that west
5-0-4, I rep that ness
.45, homie, I keep that tech
Dogs on code, I keep my pets
A-O-B, I rep that set

[Chorus: Waka Flocka Flame]
All my niggas TTG, they trained to go, shawty
Kick a door, shawty, lay down on the floor, shawty
Trained to go, shawty, I'm all about that fucking bread
Robbed so many niggas, I got a ticket on my head
All my niggas TTG, they trained to go, shawty
Kick a door, shawty, lay down on the floor, shawty
Trained to go, shawty, I'm all about that fucking bread
Robbed so many niggas, I got a ticket on my head

[Verse 5: Suge Gotti]
Guess who's in the building?
Flipped a few bricks, now I'm up a quarter million
Just trying to feed my children
Knock a nigga's brains, snatch a nigga's chain
Love them ratchet bitches, they love to give me brain
Sold so much blow, it's driving me insane
Haters have no choice, they tell them Gotti do his thing
Disrespect that clique, eat a two-piece with the Flame
I'm repping off that East Side, ain't never been a lame

[Verse 6: Baby Bomb]
I'm Baby Bomb
I'm Baby Bomb
I'm Baby Bomb, I'm Baby Bomb
I'm Baby Bomb
I'm Baby Bomb
I'm Baby Bomb
I'm Baby Bomb, I'm Baby Bomb
I'm Baby Bomb

[Chorus: Waka Flocka Flame]
All my niggas TTG, they trained to go, shawty
Kick a door, shawty, lay down on the floor, shawty
Trained to go, shawty, I'm all about that fucking bread
Robbed so many niggas, I got a ticket on my head
All my niggas TTG, they trained to go, shawty
Kick a door, shawty, lay down on the floor, shawty
Trained to go, shawty, I'm all about that fucking bread
Robbed so many niggas, I got a ticket on my head
