Uh huh, Uh huh, Uh huh, Uh huh
Eh, eh, eh, eh
Fort killers, Broke breads with brick dealers
Four-fives turn animals to chinchillas
From the South Bronx came right up
Took the wrong pill last night, f'd my night up
Uh, underrated is an understatement
I got old money prolly in your mother basement
Stash box, Hk's, Sk's, Ak's, Mac's, no laptops
From the street to the rap, ain't nothing different
Bagging up, watch the lock-down, San Quentin
Mind racing, money be my destination driver
Selling snort, heli-port, hella-choppers
You hear the beep, then you see the light
Got some homies in the pen might never see the life
Pitbull, no lice, mask on, long nose, homie with the clip full
I been making power-moves
Back when Amber Rose was shaking her ass in Sue's!
Back when Ma$e brung Randy to the block
Just couple days I had Maya on the block
Nothing changed but the players in the game
Rules and the suckers,The nerds and the cuffers
Kyle Watson: Born Undercover
Tom Sheppard, I'm all in your mother
Talking New York fool, serving the dog food, on CD's, Nah I don't talk to PD
I'm posted on the block still
Shout my homie Diddy for the Ciroc deal
I ain't signed yet, made it to the billboard
Man this the kinda shit niggas kill for
Uh, Five stacks to my favorite dancer
Stunt my ass off, shorty like "Lift your pants up"
Money longer than a flight to Taiwain!
Got your bitch going down like my timeline
?, 50 Thou Rolley-ing, 50 Cal ?
Bleached chair, be clear
We the mob took the chips need a few rings
Car 500 horses, it grow wings
I be balling like the Meadowlands
100 round drum sound like a metal band
Coldplay, U2, you now rocking with the leaders of the new school
Hundred racks, homie getting paper-cuts
Coke Boy leave you leaking like a paper-cup

Is the cup leaking yet!>?
