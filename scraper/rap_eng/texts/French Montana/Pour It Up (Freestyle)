[Hook: Rihanna]
Throw it up throw it up
Watch it fall out
Pour it up pour it
That's how we ball out
Throw it up throw it up
Watch it fall out
Pour it up pour it
That's how we ball out

[Verse 1: French Montana]
Them streets know me, Coke Boy
Them strippers know me, I'm their favorite dopeboy
I done came up in this bitch with that leaf blowin
They flip it, backhand it, Hurricane Sandy
Shorty if a nigga tip you, you might quit your job
If a nigga fuck you, you gon' make them blogs
Me and Rozay, Mr. Miami
Egyptian cloth, 92 giovannis
I said bitch I'm floor seats, I could switch the score
I said bitch if I tip you, you might make the Forbes
Give it up one time to my favorite strippers
And give it up two times to them real niggas

[Hook: Rihanna]
Oh ohh ohhh
Ohhh oh oh oh
All I see is signs
All I see is dolla' signs
Oh ohh ohhh
Ohhh oh oh oh
Money on my mind
Money money on my mind
Throw it up throw it up
Watch it fall out from the sky
Throw it up throw it up
Watch it fall out
Pour it up pour it
That's how we ball out
Throw it up throw it up
Watch it fall out

[Verse 2: Chinx Drugz]
Chinx!
Bust that pussy open on the table
Weather bitches on my car, horses in my stable
Flip it, flip it, flip it, we gon' make it triple
Two hoes slobbin' on my knob, talkin' double dribble
Coke Boys we run it
No more small bills throwin hundreds
All them broads really gon' love it
Got them boys sick to they stomachs
Ballin like a bitch, talkin Candace Parker
Got your bitch's kitty purrin' on expensive carpet
Been in corners, trendy motors
Cracked the safe, game's been decoded
Drove in but we flew out
Mortgage we threw out
See my bitch, they be like dang, like my name was Luau
