[Intro: Conor Maynard]
You never did wrong
Never hurt nobody
Could be what I got, took you in a hurry
No, no i won't tell nobody
No you can't buy time with money
But i wouldn't care how much i lose
Just for one more day with you

[Verse: Anth]
You, you, 6:42
Why the hell my sister calling me at 6:42?
She barely calls
Maybe she just got me confused
But something told me I should pick it up to see if she's cool
"Hello?"
What's wrong? What happened?
Stop crying, what you saying?
I can't understand it
So much pain in her voice
I started to panic
What the hell is going on i can only imagine
You said
You were dropping off the kids in your car
Only a couple blocks away
It wasn't even that far
But then a truck came out of nowhere driving right through the stop
I don't need to hear the rest
Just need to know where you are
You said that you n all the kids were doing fine
Couple cuts and bruises
You n the kids'll be alright
But our sister Fresia needs you there right by her side
They flew her to the hospital
They didn't tell me why
So I picked up my father I'm doing 90 on a 50
When a cop pulled me over but chose to put away the ticket
When I told him what happened n said I gotta get there quickly
Then he followed us there when he didn't have to but he did it
And I can't even lie
I can't even lie
Haven't even got inside when I start to cry
Walk up to the front desk
Ask if you're alright
I can tell something's wrong, see it in her eyes
My dad beside me and she took us down the hall
I can't wait to see you and to tell you bout it all
You'll prolly think I'm stupid
Ask me what I'm crying for
Felt like it was hours before we finally reached the door
The room that we were led inside you weren't even there
Just an empty room filled with a couple of chairs
My heart is fuckin beating
All this pain in the air and
My stomach fuckin turning
All I'm feeling is fear
The doctor walked in
Right behind were three nurses
Said they did all that they could but nothing that they did was working
'And I hate to have to tell you and I know you don't deserve it'
'But your sister didn't make it' and my heart just hit the surface like
I turn round to my father
Try to break him the news
But I ain't even have to 'cause he already knew
He don't really speak much English but what's that gotta do
When he was seeing
Feeling every broken heart in the room
Shit, How the fuck am I gon' tell my brother?
Fuck that, how the fuck am I gon' tell my mother?
How the fuck my nephew gon' grow up without a mother?
He's only 2 with a father who wished he wore a rubber
Its crazy how you never know, crazy how it go
Why the ones you love the most are the first to go?
You were always taking care of me when I was broke
So now I want you to know
I look at Jeremiah and I see you every time
And I know he ain't my son but I'll treat him like he's mine
You ain't ever gotta worry Fres
I swear that he'll be fine
Give him everything I have, every dollar, every dime
'Till you lose somebody you won't know how it feels
But I pray you never do because I swear that it kills
Death leaves a pain that nobody can heal
But the love leaves a memory nobody can steal
