[Refrain: Belly & (French Montana)]
Countin' dirty money, getting faded (getting faded)
Gold chains, gun's nickel plated (nickel plated)
Whoo! Eyes dilated (die)
Fuck around and you can die later

[Pre-Hook: French Montana]
Foreign cars, getting faded
I spend a hundred large dealer plated
Went and got a woman named Haley
I was counting dirty money. getting faded

[Hook: Belly (& French Montana)]
(And if you're talking 'bout that money, dawg)
Well tell my niggas they can have it all
(Whoo! Countin' money, getting faded
C-c-counting money, getting faded)

[Verse 1: Belly]
Fuck your mixtape, fuck your compilation
You're no longer in the conversation
I don't do this for the compensation
I don't do shit in moderation
Me and god got our own relation
Fuck a session this a congregation
Fucking bitches, that's consummation
(I swear this shit is an abomination)
This energy is intoxicating
I get you drunk over conversation
Look, they stand and watch, making observations
I'm trying to fuck with no complications, bitch!
I ain't one for the confrontation
My dawgs pull up make accommodations for you
Like a holiday or a long vacation for you
We gon' find a whole new location for you

[Pre-Hook: French Montana]
Foreign cars, getting faded
I spend a hundred large dealer plated
Went and got a woman named Haley
I was counting dirty money. getting faded

[Hook: Belly (& French Montana)]
(And if you're talking 'bout that money, dawg)
Well tell my niggas they can have it all
(Whoo! Countin' money, getting faded
C-c-counting money, getting faded)

[Verse 2: Belly]
Underground till I'm underground
Underdog till I'm under God
I can never be one of y'all
I don't fuck with like none of y'all
Hm, make another comment
Walk around with your under-armour like
I won't pull up
And put bullets all through your under garments
Damn, hot-headed but we cold-hearted
If you can't finish, why you gon' start it
Tell his mama I'm so sorry
I send her roses, there's bodies under my rose garden
That's so retarded, damn
I ain't one for the arguments
I come up in the apartments
And she treat my dick like a monument
Damn
Stay on the tree like an ornament
Wait-- I think he's onto us
Can we please just get on with it?

[Pre-Hook: French Montana]
Foreign cars, getting faded
I spend a hundred large dealer plated
Went and got a woman named Haley
I was counting dirty money. getting faded

[Hook: Belly (& French Montana)]
(And if you're talking 'bout that money, dawg)
Well tell my niggas they can have it all
(Whoo! Countin' money, getting faded
C-c-counting money, getting faded)

[Refrain: Belly]
Countin' dirty money, getting faded
Gold chains, gun's nickel plated
Whoo! Eyes dilated
Fuck around and you can die later

[Outro: Belly]
And if you're talking 'bout that money, doll
Well tell my niggas they can have it all
Whoo! You niggas violating
Fuck around and get annihilated
