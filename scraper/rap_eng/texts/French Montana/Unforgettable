Charlie:
It's not good enough for me, since I been with you
It's not gonna work for you, nobody can equal me, I know
I'm gonna sip on this drink, when I'm messed up
I should know how to pick up

I'm gonna catch the rhythm while she push up against me
Ooh, and she tipsy
I had enough convo for 24
I peep'd you from across the room

Pretty little body, dancing like GoGo, hey
And you are unforgettable
I need to get you alone
Why not?

A good good time, never hurt nobody
I got a little drink but it's not Bacardi
If you loved the girl then I'm so, so sorry
I got to give it to her like we in a marriage

Ooh, like we in a hurry
No, no I won't tell nobody
You're on your level (yo) too
Tryna do what lovers do

Leo:
My eyes closed
Hanging over the faucet
The road has been long
But baby we bossed it

The shattered mirror
Is a reflection of emotion
We're sinking like a ship
In the middle of the ocean

If there ever was a line
Just know baby we crossed it
And if there ever was a path
Just know baby we lost it

I was never good enough for you
You weren't the most trustworthy either
Only two know eachother
Look at you I see a mirror

Charlie:
And you are unforgettable
I need to get you alone

Leo:
Look at you
Asking me a question but I don't have a clue

Charlie:

Leo:
I wish that I could stay
And it pains me to be leaving
Now we're so close to comfort
It was uncomfortably deceiving

I leave flowers on your driveway
Everytime I pass your house
You are all I think about
That look inside your eyes

When you wake up
In the morning
Don't even say a word
I can hear your body calling

The things I'm gonna miss
These things when you're around
And your positivity
When I was feeling down

The sparkle in your eyes
I've never seen such passion
When you're drawing
In the evening

Your eyes are so attractive
Stare at you all night
I could stare at you all day
If you could overdose on staring

I would be up off my face
You take me to a place
That I've never been before
I memorise the steps

And I can't forget it all
The nights are getting longer
The days are getting cold
I've wanted you forever

But nothing is for sure

Charlie:
And you are unforgettable
I need to get you alone

Leo:
Look at you
Asking me a question but I don't have a clue

Charlie:
Ooh, like we in a hurry
No, no I won't tell nobody
You're on your level too
