[Verse]
Can I?
Can I?
Oh, come over and bend you over?
We could do it all night, we could do it all night
You know I never sweat it, just a waste of time
You know I never rush it, baby, take your time
Fuck all that stress, tryna clear my mind
I'm tryin to fuck your pussy and fuck your mind
You know that she with me when she missin, dawg
I heard that you be cuffing like a prison yo
I don't be kickin game, I pull it to the side
Get a grip her hair, take her swingin right
Can I?
Can I, oh, come over and bend you over?
We could do it all night, we could do it all night
I get em never cuff em up
Accustomed, not a customer
Know you gotta love em, press they buttons, never ask them not
Them all, this is like the mall closer
Shit, the more I miss you is the more I want ya
Baby come ride up on that roller coaster
I play the street, try to stay up off that wanted poster
Help me get my bread up, the first time that I met her
That pussy gettin wetter, wetter
That pussy like, cocaine, cocaine, cocaine
The pussy like cocaine, cocaine, cocaine
Can I?
Can I?
Oh, come over and bend you over?
We could do it all night, we could do it all night
