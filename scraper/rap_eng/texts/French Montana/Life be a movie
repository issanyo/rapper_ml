Yeah
Mister 16
San fran

Toast life nigga

Montana

Life be a movie
Game soo polluted
Get a gun shoot it
Get the work, move it

(Chorus x2)
Fast lane didn't stop me till the cash came
Fresher than a brick of yae
You know my bitches ate

Can't say jail never crossed my mind
Even though it never stopped my grind

(Verse 1)
Fresh up out the corners in the section 8
Now I'm sitting at the yankee games, section A
Nigga toast to life
Fuck all that open mic
Driving in the third lane
Life was a roll of dice
Under the purple clouds
Smoking on that purple loud
Nigga try to come up when the fuckin niggas turn it down
Hate be the new love
3 piece suit up
Nigga I'm the new blood
They love me like I'm hoova
Mister 16, purple m 6 beam
San fran going hard like kobe for the 6th ring
Me and fraud got them pieces for your soul jack
Bumpin bars bigavel never wanna go back

Life be a movie
Game soo polluted
Get a gun shoot it
Get the work, move it

(Chorus x2)
Fast lane didn't stop me till the cash came
Fresher than a brick of yae
You know my bitches ate

Can't say jail never crossed my mind
Even though it never stopped my grind

(Verse 2)
Uhhh
I'm lookin chubby in the pandomira
Dog the 1
The one on the head lookin through the barrel
Johnny had copped dots on the dotted line
Behind the curtains all the them niggas ain't gotta shine
All the tops while I'm throwing down everything
You know I keep a bounce between pussy and the paper
I'm heavy in the drop
Put avi in your scalp
Cause the bottle sorta pay for it
Its a sign until you make it
But I ain't broke for knowledge
Told them fuck college
Went and grabbed work
Prayed to the dollar
Illuminati get your mind sold and your body
Secret society
Trynna keep me
Know I mean???

Life be a movie
Game soo polluted
Get a gun shoot it
Get the work, move it

(Chorus x2)
Fast lane didn't stop me till the cash came
Fresher than a brick of yae
You know my bitches ate

Can't say jail never crossed my mind
Even though it never stopped my grind
