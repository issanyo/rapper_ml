[Intro : French Montana]
A.W.A the mafia my nigga
You know what it is when you hear that haaan
Kore, I’m a, I’m a Coke Boy
I’m a, I’m a, I’m a Coke Boy, Montana

[Refrain : French Montana]
They tell me, they tell me, they tell me put my gun away
They tell me, they tell me, they tell me to put my gun away
They tell me to chill, they tell me I made it
They tell me, they tell me, they tell me to put my gun away
They wanna pull up, take me away
I say they wanna pull up and take me away
For the love of, the love of, the love of money
They tell me, they tell me, they tell me to put my gun away

[Couplet 1 : French Montana]
Every time, pull up, watch the bitch smile
Every time, we pull up, wrist fifty thousands
Bitch I’m a boss, sippin’ that lean, whippin’ the sauce
Jump off the heel, panties come off, my bitch a teen whippin’ XXX
All my niggas shooters but I’m gone, trippin’ off XXX
Throwing that bird in the water
Hustler we came from the corner
Fuckin the bitch that I want
Love of the, love of the money
Call up they coming to XXX
Broken a friend you can tell ‘em
Love of the, love of the money
Coke Boy Money

[Refrain : French Montana]
They tell me, they tell me, they tell me put my gun away
They tell me, they tell me, they tell me to put my gun away
They tell me to chill, they tell me I made it
They tell me, they tell me, they tell me to put my gun away
They wanna pull up, take me away
I say they wanna pull up and take me away
For the love of, the love of, the love of money
They tell me, they tell me, they tell me to put my gun away

[Couplet 2 : Lacrim]
L’oseille pourra t’emmener où tu veux
Le problème c’est qu’t’es pas sûr d’finir vieux
En plus y’a là-celle qui t’casse les coquilles tous les jours
Les keufs on les fuck
Ils te courent après quand tu cours après l’biff’
Faut s’barrer loin d’ici, sur une île
Pattaya, mon ami, tu connais
Tout l’hiver siroter des cocktails
J’appelle Kore pour l’été à Miami
Mon gros c’est l’kif, la grosse équipe
Que du liquide, demande à French

[Refrain : French Montana]
They tell me, they tell me, they tell me put my gun away
They tell me, they tell me, they tell me to put my gun away
They tell me to chill, they tell me I made it
They tell me, they tell me, they tell me to put my gun away
They wanna pull up, take me away
I say they wanna pull up and take me away
For the love of, the love of, the love of money
They tell me, they tell me, they tell me to put my gun away
