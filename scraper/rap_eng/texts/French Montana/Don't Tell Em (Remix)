[Intro]
(Dolla, Dolla $ign)
Mustard on the beat, ho

[Verse 1: Ty Dolla $ign]
When this song come on do the ratchet
No cuffin’ here puff puff pass it
Ay, you know I’m from L.A
Stay ready we ain’t gotta get ready no
Uh, pretty face and a big butt
Told her toot it then I boot it like the World Cup
She make it Wa, Waka-Wa-Waka
She let me hit it like pah-pah

[Pre-Hook: Ty Dolla $ign]
Only is you got me feeling like this
Oh why, why, why, why, why?
Loving while grabbing the rhythm of your hips
That’s right, right, right, right, right

[Hook: Jeremih]
Rhythm is a dancer, I need a companion
Girl I guess that must be you
Body like the summer, fuck you like no other
Don’t you tell ‘em what we do
Don’t tell ‘em, don’t tell ‘em, you ain’t even
Don’t tell ‘em, don’t tell ‘em
You ain’t even, you ain’t even gotta tell ‘em
Don’t tell ‘em, don’t tell ‘em
You ain’t even, don’t tell ‘em, don’t tell ‘em
You ain’t even, you ain’t even even gotta tell ‘em
Don’t tell ‘em, don’t tell ‘em

[Verse 2: Jeremih]
Know you say you down with it
Won’t tell ‘em how you hit the ground with it
Girl you know I’m from Chicago
I act a fool, Bobby Brown with it (in it)
Nobody take me out though
You got gifts bring ‘em down the South Pole
Marathon doll, I’m putting miles
Don’t you worry about it, I can work it out

[Pre-Hook]

[Hook]

[Verse 3: French Montana]
Shawty from the back, met her in the A
Hit it at the ‘tel, never hit it where I stay, hah
You know I act the fool, Bobby Brown with it
Got her leg shaking, James Brown with it
Drop it to the ground with it
Heard the whole town hit it
Hit it then I pass it to my man, D. Brown with it
Young rich niggas, uptown
Keep her close, we snipe, duck down
And you already know
Pull up in the big ass yacht like no
Don’t tell ‘em, don’t tell ‘em
You ain’t even gotta tell ‘em
We ain’t kissin’, we ain’t tellin’
Money stack to the ceiling, hah
(Montana!)

[Pre-Hook]

[Hook]

[Outro]
Don’t tell ‘em, don’t tell ‘em no
Right, right, right, right, right, right, right
Don’t tell ‘em, don’t tell ‘em no
Why, why, why, why would you do that, oh
Just keep the rhythm like that, yeah, yeah, yeah
Put it on me baby, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
You know you like that, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
You know I want it baby, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh, oh…
