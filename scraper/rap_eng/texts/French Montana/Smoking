[Hook: French Montana]
My niggas in the bar smoking
Got my niggas in the car smoking
You got the bars open
They waiting on a next to come
Nigga my bars is wavy
Nigga even though the stars paved me
You working hard baby
They waiting on a next to come

[Verse 1: French Montana]
Catch him in the drop six
45 hit him in the head then read about it later
Homie on the news they confused
Can't pinpoint the young nigga's style, watch us break it down
A young nigga strapped with a wall to my back
Got nothing to lose, nigga we the only thing moving
Makavelli the don, all eyes on me
Fuck the 5-0, nigga only god know
Hoes got you gassed up
When we run down on you nigga, look and ask up
You swimming with the sharks, they'll tear your ass up
Then feed you to the vultures, you're food and you know this
You fuck niggas keep playing games
Hope to god I don't send them Coke Boys on the job
Bro get hit like a ticket, one way trip to god's [?]
Can't see me

[Hook: French Montana]
My niggas in the bar smoking
Got my niggas in the car smoking
You got the bars open
They waiting on a next to come
Nigga my bars is wavy
Nigga even though the stars paved me
You working hard baby
They waiting on a next to come

[Verse 2: Max B]
My first she was a taste queen, she liked using P5
This music I be doing keep me alive
Sitting in the county jail wondering
Will they ever come and get me
Send some niggas to hit me, it be
Riders in that Gran coupe
Got a nigga sliding off the seats, feeling easy
Mama come and please me
Do a nigga right like you 'posed to
I'll expose you, don't a nigga come close to
Boy stop, look a nigga up
With some bitches that'll fuck
Like the ones from your videos, daddy you saw us
Got my nigga macaroni with the cheese
So much coke in the crib, nigga we need skis
Nigga please
Keys, G's [?], the grapes
Max fit shows from state to state
Get cake, mad cake, motherfucker I'm worldwide
I'll see if he cries if his girl dies, nigga what?

[Hook: French Montana]
My niggas in the bar smoking
