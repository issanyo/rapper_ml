[French Montana]
See, we make it look easy, but niggas can't step in them shoes
Niggas keep praying they don't lose
We're all fine, every hour and hour getting high
See, we make it look easy, but niggas can't step in them shoes
Niggas keep praying they don't lose
We're all fine, every hour and hour getting high

[Verse 1: Chinx Drugz]
Trunk full of pigeons, moving like its chicken day
You know we keep the trap grooming like it’s Chick-fil-A
You came suited for the game but you ain’t fit to play
My heart's cold like the fridge in this December day
Jury overlow (overlow), Shawy love me low (love me low)
Well that trip a … that’s’ a double O
Couple homies in the feds, couple on parole
I see, like when your soldier starts to fear
I’m a bubble ho
Ride roller, white man bolger
Came bout the gutter, nigga too hard for cobras
Couldn’t fit his shoes, those too hard to cope them
Coke Boys got it on lock, we control
Nigga told me get down, it’s the only way you come up
Shawty box mean, beat that pussy like a drummer
These niggas soft, put my balls on they drumset
They had a spark now they dry like a faucet

[Hook: French Montana]
I'm so dawn, trapped here on this penny, with no way out
See, we make it look easy, but niggas can't step in them shoes
Niggas keep praying they don't lose
We're all fine, every hour and hour getting high

[Verse 2: Chinx Drugz]
I’m talking so much money, you gotta move it on a palace
No one man should have all that power
Getting money every hour and hour
Hunned drum and she forecast less shower
I be spend game schools more nigga to holler
Dummy, you’s a crash test coward
Shawty had the bomb, Sadam, terrorist
And I’m gonna detonate her, oh no, I won’t date her
Shell hit your roof, oops, knocked out all your data
Coke Boy took the off flight down the far bay
It's got me on my back, money on my scenes
This is the curtain call, this is where your show ends
Shout out my brother Rozay, I fuck with Double M
Foot up on they neck until I sign for double M’s
That’s right, so youngin get your money 'til your bank good
No matter what city you reppin, it’s the same hood

[Hook: French Montana]
