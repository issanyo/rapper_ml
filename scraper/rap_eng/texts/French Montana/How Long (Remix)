[Intro: French Montana]
Charlie
You know what it is
When you hear that, heh!
Montana

[Verse 1: Charlie Puth]
I'll admit, I was wrong, what else can I say, girl?
Can't you blame my head and not my heart?
I was drunk, I was gone, that don't make it right, but
Promise there were no feelings involved, mmh

[Pre-Chorus: Charlie Puth]
She said, "Boy, tell me honestly
Was it real or just for show?", yeah
She said, "Save your apologies
Baby, I just gotta know"

[Chorus: Charlie Puth]
How long has this been goin' on?
You've been creepin' 'round on me
While you're callin' me "baby"
How long has this been goin' on?
You've been actin' so shady
I've been feelin' it lately, baby

[Post-Chorus: Charlie Puth]
Ooo-oh (yeah)
Ooo-oh (encore)
Oooh-ooh-oh

[Verse 2: Charlie Puth]
I'll admit, it's my fault, but you gotta believe me
When I say it only happened once, mmm
I try, and I try, but you'll never see that
You're the only one I wanna love, oh, yeah

[Pre-Chorus: Charlie Puth]
She said "Boy, tell me honestly"
"Was it real or just for show?", yeah
She said, "Save your apologies"
"Baby, I just gotta know"

[Chorus: Charlie Puth]
How long has this been goin' on?
You've been creepin' 'round on me
While you're callin' me "baby"
How long has this been goin' on?
You've been actin' so shady
I've been feelin' it lately, baby

[Post-Chorus: Charlie Puth & French Montana]
Ooo-oh (yeah)
Ooo-oh (encore)
Oooh-ooh-oh
How long has this been goin' on, baby?
Ooo-oh (yeah)
Ooo-oh, you gotta go tell me now
Charlie
Oooh-ooh-oh
You know what it is
Ayy, Montana

[Verse 3: French Montana & Charlie Puth]
P-p-pull up to the club in four Lambos
Shorty tryin' to rip off the door handle
If you ain't known that, you know now
Shorty Olivia when it come to scandals
T-top down, t-top down
Fell in love with the pennys in the top down
Shorty tryin' to creep and I can't stand it
Creep, creepin' through the window like what man
Talking to herself goin' crazy
French vanilla got us both going crazy
I-I don't know what you thought
I don't wanna hear I'm sorry, my fault
How long has this been goin' on?
Montana

[Chorus: Charlie Puth]
How long has this been goin' on?
And you' been creepin' 'round on me
While you're callin' me "baby"
How long has this been goin' on?
You've been actin' so shady
I've been feelin' it lately, baby

[Post-Chorus: Charlie Puth]
(Ooo-oh, yeah)
How long has this been goin' on?
(Ooh, encore)
You've been creepin' 'round on me
(Oooh-ooh-oh)
How long has it been goin' on, baby? Oh
(Ooo-oh)
How long has this been goin' on?
(Ooh, encore)
(You gotta go tell me now)
(Oooh-ooh-oh)
You've been actin' so shady
I've been feelin' it lately, baby
