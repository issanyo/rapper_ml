[Intro: Chinx]
Fuck are you anyway
Fuck are you anyway
Who asked, who asked
Fuck are you anyway

[Hook: Chinx]
I don’t give a fuck bout what you thinking, bitch who asked you
Care bout what you smoking or you drinking, bitch who asked you
I don’t keep no new niggas round me, new niggas round me
New niggas round me, who asked you
Fuck are you anyway, fuck are you anyway
Fuck are you anyway, who asked you
Fuck are you anyway

[Verse 1: Chinx]
Bunch of niggas all up in my business, I don’t know y’all niggas
Might pull up to the venue, I’m with four, five bitches
Shipment that I’m waiting on, it got the coastguard tripping
Never traffic in a whip that got the Onstar system
Nigga stand at 5’11” but my dope 58
Skinny dipping with two bitches from the lone star state
Niggas way too familiar, new whip [?] villas
My little bitch got the drop, she gone shake a few niggas
Woke up early in the morning on my own dick
Used to play the jail phone booth until the phone clicked
Now I blow 100 in the spot cause that’s a small thing
Could see this vision way back when I played the hallway

[Hook: Chinx]
I don’t give a fuck bout what you thinking, bitch who asked you
Care bout what you smoking or you drinking, bitch who asked you
I don’t keep no new niggas round me, new niggas round me
New niggas round me, who asked you
Fuck are you anyway, fuck are you anyway
Fuck are you anyway, who asked you
Fuck are you anyway

[Verse 2: French Montana]
Catch me flying in [?], past you
Chase the money not a ho, bitch who asked you
I said bitch, man who asked you
Bought the whole thing then we broke it down to capsules
Chasing money, not a ho
I be riding through the city on my own shit
Bitch you talking, tell me like you know
And every time he talking to me I be gripping on my tooly
Ride up in that shit and screws be [?]
We ride up in that shit with the ceilings off
When I’m dealing with that business all my feelings off
Me, Montana made a killing dog

[Hook: Chinx]
I don’t give a fuck bout what you thinking, bitch who asked you
Care bout what you smoking or you drinking, bitch who asked you
I don’t keep no new niggas round me, new niggas round me
New niggas round me, who asked you
Fuck are you anyway, fuck are you anyway
Fuck are you anyway, who asked you
Fuck are you anyway
