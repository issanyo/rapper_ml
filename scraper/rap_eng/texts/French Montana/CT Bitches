She Got The Nerve To Ask Me Fergie Can I Be Your Wife
Yea Fuckin' Rite, You Are Not My Type
Just Let Me Lay The Pipe And Maybe You Can Stay The Night
And You The Same Chick That Shave Biggaveli
And Went Around Around The Pole
Frenchy Love Her In The Cell
Use A Slut, Use A Smut That's's Why I Treat You Like A Sell
Come To Your Crib And Serve You
Take Ya Money And Heard You
No Disrespect To My Ct Diva's That Drive Nice Whips

Ct Chruch Girls That Love To Play Jesus
This Ain't For Ya'll, This For My Ct Seekers
I Like The Ones In The Club Smoking Reefer
Tugging On My Shirt Hoping I V.I.P Her
Whisper In Your Ear, Meet Me In The Lobby At The Holiday Inn
When We There You Could Slide Back Again

[Chorus: Max B]
I Love Them Ct Bitches, Ct Bitches Be On Me, Ct Bitches Be On Me
They Love To Suck Fuck When Ever They Be Lonely (They Be Lonely)
I'm a Need 3 Bitches And Leave So We Switch She Be Lonely Me
She Be Lonely Me Baby Be Lonely Me, I Never Ever Wanna Let Goo Goooo
