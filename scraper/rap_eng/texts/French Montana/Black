[Hook x2: French Montana]
Black tee, black sneakers, black fitted cap (fitted cap)
Black guns, black V's top spinnin' back (spinnin' back)
When we ride on our enemies
Smoking pot, drinking Hennessy

[Verse 1: French Montana]
This young nigga 14 tried to move them out
Drinking on that codeine, 10 toes on the floor
Hear that phone rang, ringing at that door thang
Fuck all that rap shit, nigga dis that sho thang
10 phones on me, 10 hoes on me
Cops on patrol, fed that load on me (woooh)
Let the haters watch, on that Lenox drop
Spent your whole advance on a Baylor watch
Got my pack a [?] for my mile waster
Did a show on a island, thats a gran cancion
We yell fuck 'em all (all)
Fuck 'em all
On that ground fe' that money
Nigga, let it ball (ball)

[Hook x2: French Montana]

On the block servin' corners, like a arcade (haha)
Know this nigga been afraid, savarge in a [?] (allo)
Squeeze the juice outa pistol meenemay (braaat)
You know my flag all red like santa

Try'na rob on the same shit, mob on the same shit (what's up?)

Chop the fork raw, R.I.P. Stack Bundles (oohhhrooo)

[Hook x2: French Montana]

[Verse 3: Chinx Drugz]

Might be a drive-by when I whip back
Click clack, get back, think fast
Full your fucking brains in, dont what you wear
Bad bitches staring

Nigga this that Coke Boy, Brick Squad, whip it 'til it get hard
Styling on these niggas like I want them
Ya, everything moves for the Chinx, get your racks
Them bitch niggas flamed on your homie, get your strap
And bring it on (bring it on)
All black Koops, SEALS navy blue
Point blank range is a shame, how that 80 doing?
