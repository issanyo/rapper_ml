(Hook)

Shawty bust it open then I bust er back
Niggas talkin but we talkin cash
Poppin bottles then we poppin tags
You know we came with the money bags
Shawty bust it open then I bust er back
Niggas talkin but we talkin cash
Poppin bottles and poppin tags
You know we came with the money bags
Cake! We came wit it
You know we came with the money bags
Cake! We came wit it
You know we came with the money bags

[Verse 1:
French Montana]

Shawty bust it open then I bust er back
Niggas talkin, we talkin cash
Call me AKK came wit it
Old school money

, big daddy came wit it
She throw it back, I’m throwin' stacks
Told that bitch, take 3 days to count it back
If it’s real, tat my name on it
Throw it, blue dot pour it
Smoke like I grow it, dirty Sprite I pour it
Coke Boys you know, pay like you owe em
What you need I got, smoking weed, drinkin blue dot
,Never sober


(Hook)


[Verse 2: Chinx]
Freedom is for real, you lame niggas playin wit it
Menace to this shit, just like old dog, it came wit it
Inside all white, like I put cocaine in it
I just bend er over, scarecrow, no brain wit it
Wrist froze, I breeze it in
So slick, I slide out
Headed to the Sean Combs honey cone hideout
Yo bitch be tail gatin, killed that, new tricks
I just hit Shawty then pick up them shell cases
Saint Nick, I came with the bags
Slidin down the chimney straight up on that ass
And that pussy up like a top with a slap
Really I’ve been sober but I’m high above the cash


(Verse)
Lil Durk -
Bust it open,Pussy Poppin I'm On It morning
We takin shots of that roll, turnin up to the morning
Bang Bros that bitch, we turn her out Ion Want her
We just threw 20 thousand, we make it back in The Morning
Cake cake shot straight, fat bitch, ass thick
Bottom red model bitches, take em down, I’m the shit
White gold, call that catholic, do the dash and I’m lit
Tryna ride you get licked
Turnin up, turnin up
I just wanna check up there like Nike do
I’ve been chasin money since ‘92
Money bags Shawty it’s what money do
You would do the same if you had money too
