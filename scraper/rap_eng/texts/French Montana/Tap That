[Intro]
Hey, you right there, bring your fine ass over here
Come on and let a nigga tap that
Let me tap that

[Verse 1: French Montana]
I gotta keep my cool, moulin rouge
Come fuck with French
You know how I move in a room full of boats
Gotta move fast
Get the cash, see the dime lookin good pass
Get a wine glass, with your fine ass
Flashy, classy with her nasty
Thick ass, hair long, baby's some hair wrong
Big tips, I don't trip, I take trips
G five in the air, baby mind blown
Face down, ass up, let me climb on it
A life's short, take advantage of that
Though and take your shoes and your pants off

[Hook]
Let a nigga tap that
Come on and let a nigga tap that
Stop playin and let a nigga tap that
I know you wanna let a nigga tap that

[Verse 2: Stack Bundles]
Look, nothin to talk about
Soon as she sit at coup two think we out
Holla at a friend like, "Bitch, be out."
Fore we hit the toke got my dick in her mouth
Hah, that's how it's supposed to go
When your necklace glow, he's supposed to know
Before she even get in the car she lettin freakin me eatin when we creep on a star
She know she in a mist with a real g, that's why she don't touch, you feel me?
Keep real me, really, let that lights down
Tell me gettin (?)
I'm like girlfriend, girlfriend, we could leave here make your girlfriends girlfriends
I got my cheese with me and I brought my girlfriend
Never find a better nigga you ain't gotta sweat a nigga

Come on and let a nigga tap that
Stop playin and let a nigga tap that
I know you wanna let a nigga tap that

[Verse 3: Chinx Drugz]
Real momma let me chop it up witch
Top shelf sippin
You're four chicks deep real life dirk dig get up with the ballers, slide with the poppas
Slide liquor plus I keep the hollows in the shotgun
Keep workin that for shorty
Pull at my show
Back stage with a show, only thing I wanna know is if you goin at a nigga
Stop playin, you know, nigga
Want it. Man I sell sixty on coup
Want it all two nigga pupils dialated
Try and hit your girl too
Right be the game
Coke boys, know we got the city in a sling
Messy with these hoes, no playin, tryin to get you out these clothes
Like drop your head up, try and hit you in the roll
All up in your cat litter, momma back with your first let stack hit ya

[Hook]
Just let a nigga tap that

Stop playin and let a nigga tap that
