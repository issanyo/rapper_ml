Elephants don't swing through trees!
They don't? Well what am I thinking of?
Monkeys!
Well in that case....

[Intro: Max B]
Let's start some shit off like this
Frenchy
Alright
Boss Don Biggavel, macaroni with the cheese, let's go

[Verse 1: Max B]
I don't really love these hoes
All I do is smoke sour diesel
Driving in the third lane, riding on Byrdgang
Bitch, me and Frenchy we working, squirt things
Bigger than your leg, i'ma pump one in your head
Get the big chef in the game, you bitches give me my spread!
Got me a brand new drop, and some brand new rocks, lookin nice
Cooking, let mama know the price
See the quarter stroll, no bullshit
Nigga why you spending all ya money on furnish?
Cause my ma, I earned it, its not your concern what I do with it
I can do a brick, we can kick it and shoot the shit
Coming through looking all clean, all the bitches like to fiend for the dick
I'm just trying to get in between
Get em on the lean while he greasy
Shouts to my nigga Al Peezly
Nigga this is easy...give me my money!

[Hook: M.I.A]
All I wanna do is *Bang Bang Bang Bang*
And *Click* *Ka-Ching*
And take your money [x4]

[Verse 2: French Montana]
Homie grind allday never took a off day
Tell them haters give me room, nigga get em off me
They don't wanna stake up, everyday I wake up
Bagging up the bud, homie, then smoke the shake up
Puff puff then fly like a plane
Reminiscing over time nigga riding on the train
Now you open the garage, it's a lotta nice things
Woke up today alive so I really can't complain
It don't happen when you want, it happen when it's supposed to be
Lost my close niggas, so my heater right close to me
I don't know niggas but you see that they notice me
Paranoid, ready to shoot a nigga approaching me
[?] be the illest, you riding with the realest
Get the brown bag then drive it out the dealer
I got the streets, can't take it from me
All I wanna do is take ya money, coke boy!

[Hook: M.I.A]
All I wanna do is *Bang Bang Bang Bang*
And *Click* *Ka-Ching*
And take your money [x4]

[Outro: French Montana]
Max what up?
Bruno!
Grease!
It's that Coke Wave baby!
My nigga Max Spaghettilinsky
You already know!
Coke wave, you sniff me?
