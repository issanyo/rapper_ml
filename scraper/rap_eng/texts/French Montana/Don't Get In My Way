[Hook: Kontraversy]
We into the money, we into the bitches
You play with the money, we sending them hitters
We play with the money, we fucking your bitches
We fuck up a check and we fucking them strippers
We play with the money my nigga, we get it
We took over everything nigga, we with it
The only thing moving is me and my niggas
We rushing into it, the money the movement
So nigga don't get in my way

[Verse 1: Kontraversy]
Nigga don't get in my way
Rugby he gripping the Glock, I run around with the K
I been addicted to pots, I'm into whipping the yay
I'm into coming to cities, fucking it up for the cake
Flooding that shit then I'm flooding my wrist
Cause the work that we got is amazing
Been fucking them bitches that's fucking with bitches
That pussy they throwing amazing
Look at these stones in the chain
Look at these stones in the rings
Look at my niggas, we looking like money
We getting that shit every way
Me and my niggas, they calling us drop boys
We playing with birds, we trapping the drops boy
We been in the streets playing with coke boy
Now we with French, and he brought the Coke Boys

[Hook: Kontraversy]
We into the money, we into the bitches
You play with the money, we sending them hitters
We play with the money, we fucking your bitches
We fuck up a check and we fucking them strippers
We play with the money my nigga, we get it
We took over everything nigga, we with it
The only thing moving is me and my niggas
We rushing into it, the money the movement
So nigga don't get in my way

[Verse 2: French Montana]
Put the toast on my lap, and the coast on my back
Put your bitch on her knees, then I blow out her back
I put a million hours in that kitchen
With that tunnel vision, that's why all my diamonds glisten
I stay high on some [?]
My seat down, my cash up
Her face down, her ass up
Head down, my glass up
My niggas 'round, they strapped up
Like, me and Chinx, he getting wavy with some porno stars
Got your bitch tip-toeing on my marble floors
Hundred thousand in that chain, about a mansion on that watch
I got 100 rounds in that K, I leave you planking on your block
It's that Brick Squad, Coke Boy
Break her heart for that show boy
Forty large for that old boy
Pillsbury Doughboy

[Hook: Kontraversy]
We into the money, we into the bitches
You play with the money, we sending them hitters
We play with the money, we fucking your bitches
We fuck up a check and we fucking them strippers
We play with the money my nigga, we get it
We took over everything nigga, we with it
The only thing moving is me and my niggas
We rushing into it, the money the movement
So nigga don't get in my way

[Outro: Kontraversy]
We play with the money my nigga, we get it
We took over everything nigga, we with it
The only thing moving is me and my niggas
We rushing into it, the money the movement
So nigga don't get in my way
