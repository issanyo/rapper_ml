Nigga walk up in the spot wearing that same shit Jesus used to wear (egyptian cloths)
The other nigga, talking that's fly as shit

Could have been a pilot, could have been a doctor
Could have been a pimp, could have been a mobster
Could have been a nap, could have been a dope boy
Homie matter of fact, I'm a motherfuckerin' coke boy

You wiggling baby, I'm a motherfuckerin coke boy
You wiggling baby, I'm a motherfuckerin coke boy
You wiggling baby, I'm a motherfuckerin coke boy
You wiggling baby, I'm a motherfuckerin coke boy

Rallies on the roll, prezies never fold
Mommy, you ain't got to take a vote to hit the pole
Just bounce it up and down, spread it all around
Hit the homies off, pass it all around
I'm talking about the money, I'm talking about them ems
I'm talking about the rollie, 67 pins
Few homies with me, couple in the benz
Shawty said I'm foul, she heard I hit her friends
Rocks in your bake pot, starting from a dope spot
Made my first couple hundred whipping on a stove top
Me and Frenchie, in that new ghost Phantom
Comfy where I'm at, but I could have been a, could have been a

Could have been a pilot, could have been a doctor
Could have been a pimp, could have been a mobster
Could have been a nap, could have been a dope boy
Homie matter of fact, I'm a motherfuckerin' coke boy

You wiggling baby, I'm a motherfuckerin coke boy
You wiggling baby, I'm a motherfuckerin coke boy
You wiggling baby, I'm a motherfuckerin coke boy
You wiggling baby, I'm a motherfuckerin coke boy

Any given time, Benz in the grill
Ten toes down, both hands on the feel
Probably on a molley, probably on some syrup
They know I'm putting off, on the bleachers hoes cheer us
City on my back, lanes in the wind
Coop like a shark, no, you lames see the fin
Treadin' upshore, these hoes won't swim
My wrists be the bait, the fish getting in
Knocked out her tube sock, gave the whole crew whops'
Shine on the game like you're head when the roof drop
A bum, man, and you're still a bum, now
Always been a clown, but you could have been a, could have been a

Could have been a pilot, could have been a doctor
Could have been a pimp, could have been a mobster
Could have been a nap, could have been a dope boy
Homie matter of fact, I'm a motherfuckerin' coke boy

You wiggling baby, I'm a motherfucker coke boy
You wiggling baby, I'm a motherfucker coke boy
You wiggling baby, I'm a motherfucker coke boy
You wiggling baby, I'm a motherfucker coke boy

Go ahead, baby, go ahead, baby
Go ahead, baby, go ahead, baby
