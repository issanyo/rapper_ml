[Intro]
Don't panic, nigga don't panic
Don't panic, nigga don't panic

[Hook]
Shawty fell in love with a hustler
Man I took her from a buster
Niggas keep talkin' like they know something
I slide on  your bitch like she on something
Don't panic, don't panic
We just getting started nigga don't panic
Real niggas getting cake
Watch the fake niggas hate
Don't panic, don't panic
We just getting started nigga don't panic
Don't panic, don't panic
We just getting started nigga don't panic

[Verse 1]
Talking fish scales like a whole salmon
See you fuck niggas from four planets
Just getting started nigga don't panic
If you a star, I'm a whole planet
Acting like she won't get it
Have her run through the team like Jerome Bettis
You don't want it, don't look for it
Have your bitch on a surfboard
Surfboard, surfboard
If you want this money, gotta work for it
Puff puff pass, with your looking ass
Bust it wide open, make it nasty

[Verse 2]
I won’t let up
Sippin’ that Ciroc amaretto
Real bitches gon’ wait on me
Fake bitches gon’ skate on me
Real bitches getting cake
Fake bitches gon’ hate
She a model on the Gram
Getting swallowed was the plan
This young thug need four bitches
Take her to the crib take no pictures
Ass fat, let me get up on it
Bounce back early in the morning
