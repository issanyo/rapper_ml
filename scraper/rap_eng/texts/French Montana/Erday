[Intro: French Montana]
Talkin' every night
All my dogs gettin' lit, talkin' every night
Juicin' my body from side to side

[Hook: French Montana & Chris Brown]
I be ridin' through the city, gettin' lit every night
Baby, if the head good, I'mma run every light
Man, if the pussy good, I'mma hit it every night
Man, if that money good, I'mma get it every night
I be lit every night, out to get every high
I be whipped every night, I be sippin' every night
Out the roof every night, off the crew every night
Out in Louis every night, in the coupe every night
I spend all my money on it baby, every night
All these diamonds, they ain't come from singin', every night
We be too lit, you know we goin' crazy, every night
Pop a pill, we rock 'n rollin' baby, every night

[Verse 1: French Montana]
Ridin' through the city, we be straight, 12 o'clock
Yeah, all my niggas Gucci and I ain't talkin' 'bout Guwop
Yeah, all we rock is Gucci, watch me, watch the watch
Yeah, hit up AOD, tell 'em gon' get 'em molly

[Verse 2: Chris Brown]
Bangin' out the bottle, got me loosed in the Goose
Baby, you should be the driver cause I'm gon' let it roof
You a pretty, little lady, fuck the devil outta you
I'm about to roll the dice, daddy need some new shoes

[Hook: French Montana & Chris Brown]
I be ridin' through the city, gettin' lit every night
Baby, if the head good, I'mma run every light
Man, if the pussy good, I'mma hit it every night
Man, if that money good, I'mma get it every night
I be lit every night, out to get every high
I be whipped every night, I be sippin' every night
Out the roof every night, off the crew every night
Out in Louis every night, in the coupe every night
I spend all my money on it baby, every night
All these diamonds, they ain't come from singin', every night
We be too lit, you know we goin' crazy, every night
Pop a pill, we rock 'n rollin' baby, every night

[Verse 3: Chris Brown]
Wanna take your body down, fine little motherfucker
Want it right now, bitch you know I ain't a sucker
Think she off that angel dust but I ain't for complainin'
I know that pussy dangerous but I can't let you win
She wobble it, wobble it
She poppin' that pussy, she all on the pole
Droppin' it, droppin' it
I'm throwin' this money all on the floor
What you tryna do in the bedroom?
Cause we don't be playin' no games
Cause that pussy be fuckin' my head up
I need it every day

[Hook: French Montana]
