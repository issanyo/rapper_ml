[Verse 1 / Intro]
We can't go on like this
Eventually, we'll grow old
Fall apart into dust
I can't, imagine it
I care, but it's not worth it
Keep fallin' and fallin'
But does the fall ever end?
You're the only one that got the best of me
Open and closin'
Revolvin' doors never end
Can't deny, I gave you the best of me
Just don't know what it is

[Chorus]
Spring, summer
You disappeared in the night
Fall came right back again
Froze in my arms
Your love changes more than the seasons
When I get close, you turn cold
For no reason at all
(Reason at all)
For no reason at all

[Verse 2]
If you don't want none of this
Please set me free
Broken wings can't fly home
I can't, imagine it (yeah)
I care, but it's not worth it
Tell me now what's the point, baby?
Tell me what's the point, baby?
Tell me, eh?

[Chorus]
Spring, summer
You disappeared in the night
Fall came right back again
Froze in my arms
Your love changes more than the seasons
When I get close, you turn cold
For no reason at all
For no reason

[Chorus / Outro]
Spring, summer
(You disappeared in the night)
Fall came right (back again)
Froze in my arms
Your love changes more than the seasons
(More than the seasons)
When I get close, you turn cold
For no reason
For no reason
For no reason at all
