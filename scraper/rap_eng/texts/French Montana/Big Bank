[Intro: Rick Ross]
Being self made is all I know, till my dick in the dirt
One time for the real niggas

[Hook: Rick Ross 2x]
Big bank take little bank
Drop an X pill in the fish tank
Got the sharks on lean
Fish scale for my whole team

[Verse 1: Pill]
Watch that four door gone pull up
Watch them hoes gone pogo out
Cake my birthday blow them candles baby please don't blow my high
It's a band aid on your forehead I got people on my knot
It keep bulging up out my pocket said release me to the sky
This is big bank talk bank, vault frequent visitors
Swear that money keep a nigga shitten like the chili does
Hot dog tater chip bag ass nigga
No shirt, no shoes, no swag ass nigga
I'll get cash ass nigga, put that title by my name
Hottest lighters I'mma fighter plus that rifle gotta aim
I just left the title game, donâ€™t that trophy look so shiny
And your ho keep tryna poke me I'm surrounded by this diamonds (okay then)

[Hook:]

[Verse 2: Meek Mill]
I say Benji after Benjamin, pretty hoes I'm swimmin' in
And if they ain't talkin' money
It's just fuck it like my women friend
Pull up in the Aston sound sexy when the engine rim
It goes Vroom, Vroom, Scrrr that bitch cost like 7 birds
Cruise me down my 7 swimming in that money bitch
She say she don't like them broke, she in love with money dick
And money make her cum I keep her busting like 100 clip
Marathon on that paper baby I be running shit
Big bank take little bank
100 carrot diamond chain make them hoes blink
30 shots make them fucking jack boys think
20,000 old money ya'll lil Franks

[Hook:]

[Verse 3: Torch]
Money stuck on my mind, .40 tucked in my jeans
Dice game trying to stop the bank, I lose can a motherfucker lean? (Nah)
Big bank take little bank, 2 shakes in the middle with a ball pit
You awful my sharks starvin and I'mma eat your mutha fuckin food again
My hands dirty, my face clean
Self made, trying to stay up about to stay clean
Work that triple beam, pappy call me fuego
Money low break it down, 36
Leg up, grind like I need my break switch
28 on a spaceship
Straight fish whip 2 3 racks on racks
Aaron Rodgers, I quarterback the pack

[Hook:]

[Verse 4: French Montana]
I fuck 4 bitches, I got 8 balls
I'll finish your career, nigga: 8 bars
Fly with that, got streets I got with that
Slept on me nigga, power-nap
[?]
8 in that glitter and gold, bitch that's vs1
Bitch a hundred fifty, you niggas smell a fishy
You ain't got pills up in that tank, Mills up in that bank
You know I coach them niggas
Like Phil up in that paint
50 thou on that Rollie, 50 thou bet on Kobe
6 feet 2 in Maybach, 100 clip for the payback
100 grand in this motherfucker
Gotta hold a 10 in this motherfucker
Coke boy ima get Japan in this muthafucka

[Hook:]
