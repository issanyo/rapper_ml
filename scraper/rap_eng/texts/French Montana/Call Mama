[Chorus: French Montana & Quavo]
Got so high I done called Mama
So high I done called Mama
Make away let me bust a dance move
Make away let me bust a dance move
Pull up on the boulevard
Straight to the point I don't talk
I got a coupe I can't park
All my dawgs goin' hard
I threw the money told her look back at it
I threw the money told her look back at it
She make that booty bounce like a jackrabbit
She make that booty bounce like a jackrabbit
She all about the money I ain't mad at ya
She all about the money I ain't mad at ya
If you all about the money I ain't mad at ya
If you all about the money I ain't mad at ya

[Verse 1: Quavo]
I just wanna see lil mama
Bounce that ass like a drumma
Because I got an anaconda
She do whatever I want her
I wanna go and tell my mama
Her hair so long like Rapunzel
She told me don't eat your lasagna
So I gotta listen to my mama

[Chorus: French Montana & *Quavo*]
Got so high I done called Mama
So high I done called Mama
Make away let me bust a dance move
Make away let me bust a dance move
Pull up on the boulevard
Straight to the point I don't talk
I got a coupe I can't park
All my dawgs goin' hard
I threw the money told her look back at it
I threw the money told her look back at it
She make that booty bounce like a jackrabbit
She make that booty bounce like a jackrabbit
She all about the money I ain't mad at ya
She all about the money I ain't mad at ya
If you all about the money I ain't mad at ya
If you all about the money I ain't mad at ya

[Verse 2: French Montana]
If you all about the money I ain't mad at ya
[?] I throwed up you look back at it
Got me comin' back like a crack addict
I take a night off then I'm back at it

[Chorus: French Montana & *Quavo*]
Got so high I done called Mama
So high I done called Mama
Make away let me bust a dance move
Make away let me bust a dance move
Pull up on the boulevard
Straight to the point I don't talk
I got a coupe I can't park
All my dawgs goin' hard
I threw the money told her look back at it
I threw the money told her look back at it
She make that booty bounce like a jackrabbit
She make that booty bounce like a jackrabbit
She all about the money I ain't mad at ya
She all about the money I ain't mad at ya
If you all about the money I ain't mad at ya
If you all about the money I ain't mad at ya
