French montana:
Coke boys record
We got them straight dropping everybody know (bad boy)
Where the money at tell me where to go (MMG)
Niggas joking hunt around if you funny bone
Life short nigga bumble money grown
Grind for years niggas tryna fly them ??
Homie won a 100 mill but he caught a 100 years
Geting more money cause i care less
Imma ball double r on my headwrist
Ross and diddy got a nigga all illuminated
Fornicated get your main bitch illuvicated
Came from the bottom now a nigga packing fields
Came from the bottom now the house on the hill
Can you see me ho? bitch can you see me now
Got me on my pac shit are you still down
36 0's to 36 homs 36 cars 36 ho's
When i caught my first slick never lookin back
30 chains on looking like a turtleneck
I see you niggas broke you wanna hit this dough
You wanna gainst the grain nigga gotta watch ya choke
In the prensence of the greatest humbleling
Coke boys bad boys and them double m
Reaching for the stars but my feet so grounded
Speak to the boss nigga dont creep around me
You got funny ways, niggas fucking gay
You went raw pickle you got 20 days
Peek the Frank mueller, imma sharp shooter
Can't jerk me homie, i let ya stank do that
Im still affiliated with them brick dealers
Affiliated with them niggas tryna wash billions
We buying cheers you niggas thousand ears
Fuck with the dream team need a thousand years
Pyrex boy montana straight chemist
Feelings to the side nigga straight business

Outro:
Say your ready, but you not ready
We got them straight dropping everybody know
Where the money at tell me where to go
