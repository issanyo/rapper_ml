[Intro :]
Aye, these hoes fucking up the concentration
These hoes fucking up the concentration
Montana!

[Hook :]
These hoes fucking up your concentration
These hoes fucking up your concentration
Look at me, now I'm paper chasing
Look at me, now I'm paper chasing
These hoes fucking up your concentration
These hoes fucking up your concentration
Look at me, now I'm paper chasing
Look at me, don't i look amazing?

[Verse 1]
You niggas need a little motivation
You hear me preaching to the congregation
Ion save em,  Ion chase a hoe
Chase a hard rock and paper
Wheels Black but the coupe Caucasian
Kush Purple Got me looking half asian
I feel amazing, spend about a thousand on Cartier
These hoes throw you for a loop
Have you spending all your loot check
I ain't got the time or the patience
Getting money my occupation

[Hook :]
These hoes fucking up your concentration
These hoes fucking up your concentration
Look at me, now I'm paper chasing
Look at me, now I'm paper chasing
These hoes fucking up your concentration
These hoes fucking up your concentration
Look at me, now I'm paper chasing
Look at me, don't i look amazing?

[Verse 2]
These hoes got you for your loot
Got you speeding, drinking absolute
You ain't think the bitch was leaving? absolute
Once she bought the crib, then she bought the coupe
If she ain't a Ryder, cut the circulation
Ass, titties, jumping like its regulation
Young and reckless on the come up
Cover boy never been a come up
Pull up with the pubs smoking medication
You ain't talking money, fuck your conversation
Roof open, bum eyes closed
These hoes fucking up the concentration

[Hook :]
These hoes fucking up your concentration
These hoes fucking up your concentration
Look at me, now I'm paper chasing
Look at me, now I'm paper chasing
These hoes fucking up your concentration
These hoes fucking up your concentration
Look at me, now I'm paper chasing
Look at me, don't i look amazing?
