Her boyfriend ain't talkin' about nothin', haaan
She told me don't get her in trouble, haaan

She wanna dope boy that'll take her to the top

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
Cause she wanna get fucked by a young nigga in the night time
She gon' let me lick the booty when the lights down

Stop wastin' your time with them fuck niggas
Yeah baby, if you let me lick it, I'ma kiss it, I'ma stick it
All in like, yeah baby, woah, yeah baby

[Verse 2: Fetty Wap]
Have you ever been fucked by a thug nigga?
Late night on the block, bustin' juggs Zoo Gang full of drug dealers
1738 in my cup, yeah niggas knowin' drunk niggas
When I pull up to the club, see the hostess in the car, wassup, I'ma trail nigga on a Louie stocking
Hit the plug up, thinkin' I in heavy
Zip the drugs up, bitch I'm in traffic
'Bout to lit 'em up now and I don't give a fuck now
You can tell me where the drugs now
You ain't gotta stunt now, Zoo Gang do drugs now
Memories what it was now, I just let the guns now
Man I swear she got me bogged down
We be fuckin' on the rug now (Squad!)
Yeah baby

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
Cause she wanna get fucked by a young nigga in the night time
She gon' let me lick the booty when the lights down
Baby, you need to fuck with a real nigga
Stop wastin' your time with them fuck niggas
Yeah baby, if you let me lick it, I'ma kiss it, I'ma stick it
All in like, yeah baby, woah, yeah baby

[Verse 3: Chris Brown]
I hit the Quan in that pussy, while you flexin'
Fuck around and drop a bomb in that pussy
I pour a bowl in that cream soda
I got a section full of hoes, bring the team over
I see the look in the hoe face
I see you takin' the molly, wantin' the whole thing
Yeah, white girls on that cocaine
We be smokin' California, call it propane
Lamborghinis and Ferraris when we switch lanes
And your bitch call me karate, how I kick game
Know I got my nick name from my dick game
I'ma take your girl, fuckin' up a good thing
They gon' hate on me
Yeah cause they girl gon' leave
She gon' ride it for me
Ain't no love, she just wanna get fucked

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
She wanna get fucked by a young nigga in the night time
She gon' let me lick the booty when the lights down
Baby you need to fuck with a real nigga
Stop wasting your time with them fuck niggas
Yeah baby, if you let me lick it, I'ma kiss it, I'ma stick it
All in like, yeah baby, woah, yeah baby
