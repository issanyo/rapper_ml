[Intro: Travi$ Scott]
I just got back from the moon, hmm
I told her be back soon, yeah

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
I told her hold it down
She fuckin' with the plug, told her, “Come over now"
Where are all my bitches tonight? (Olay, olay, yeah, yeah)
Bring me some more bitches tonight (olay, olay, yeah, yeah)
Yeah, I bought a hunnid rounds
She askin' for fifty, threw a hunnid thou'
Where are all my bitches tonight? (Olay, olay, yeah, yeah)
Bring me some more bitches tonight, yeah (olay, olay, yeah, yeah)
I'm feelin' like Moses, I'm all in the ocean, I'm partin', divided up in it like Moses
She switchin' the motions and makin' them faces just like an emoji
Pineapple Fanta, it mixed with the Xanax, she lovin' the codeine
All of my killas, they ready to follow me, I feel like Moses

[Post-Chorus: French Montana & Chris Brown]

[Verse 2: Chris Brown]
Look at the presi', fuck with the Rollie and move like the president

I don’t run from woop woop, shit, fuck the police, yeah

[Chorus: Chris Brown & Takeoff]

When it come to trappin', give you the formula
Cuban links hang on my neck like the ornament
Fuck on your bitch, I give her back, don’t want the bitch

[Verse 5: Takeoff]

Dabblin' in fashion, it’s magic
Two snow bunnies, call ‘em Mary Kate & Ashley (woo)
Keep it on me, quick to shoot a three
Like Dirk Nowitzki from the Dallas Mavericks (bop, bop. bop, bop)

[Verse 6: Quavo]

She said she wanna fuck with a real nigga
She said she wanna go to war and kill with you (yeah)
50 bottles in the VIP, 50 models
