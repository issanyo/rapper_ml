[Intro]
You know
It’s kinda fucked up, but
It’s kinda like you’re born to lose, you know what I mean?
Steady young, get your own
Montana!

[Hook]
You already know that
All this money I be staring at
You already know that
All this money I be staring at
All this money I be staring at
Bring your love baby, I’mma bring my shame
Bring the drugs baby, I’mma bring my pain
You already know that
All this money I be staring at
All this money I be staring at

[Bridge]
I don’t know what’s worse?
To never get it
Or get it and lose it (ALL)
You know what I mean?
Sanctuary baby
You know what they say
It’s the game of life
And you don't get to play it twice
Juuuheard?

[Verse 1]
Die young: Honor
Live long: You die twice
Only in the dark, you gonn' shine bright
Cause you a star
Locked Max, took Chinx
God got a plan for ya
With open arms
Nobody gave a hand to ya
Chase the fame, you in trouble
Crack the bank, and I double
Don't bump heads in the huddle
Made a mill, saw the devil
Crib on that water, I'm taking pictures
When they take me
Send me money or at least send me pictures
Still chasing the high
Dem boys waiting outside
Car seized when I fly
Caught cases on trial
'Till they take me away....
(...Montana!)
Shout out to [inaudible]

[Hook]
You already know that
All this money I be staring at
You already know that
All this money I be staring at
All this money I be staring at
Bring your love baby, I’mma bring my shame
Bring the drugs baby, I’mma bring my pain
You already know that
All this money I be staring at
All this money I be staring at

[Verse 2]
A car, big mansion, and the bezel
Tryna make a deal with the devil
I want it all!
Born to lose, ain’t it?
Rules in engagement
Glued to the pavement
Sell it all!
My first flip, was when the needle hit my vein
Lost it all, is when the drugs fixed the pain
"Pray for me" tatted on my neck!
Fuck money, I was dying for my respect (Ah!)
I was high getting wet, was the way of life
Stranded on the block
Fiends buying work
Only thing in sight
Had to pay the light
Mama working 3 jobs
Father leaning, he high
My home boy on the run, he hot!
Montana!

Bring the drugs baby, I’mma bring my pain
You already know that
All this money I be staring at
