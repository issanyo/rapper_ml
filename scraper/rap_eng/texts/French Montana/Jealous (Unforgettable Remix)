Verse 1:
Babe you know what hurts
Is when I see what's mine
You spending time
With another guy
Feels like a crime
I don't know baby girl
But it's on my mind
I try to, hold it in
But I just can't lie
I mean
I know it feeds ya ego
My jealousy builds up
Just like a gazebo
My trust points sitting
At absolute zero
But I try to keep it cool
Like the veggie in burritos
Still feeding that ego
Come baby girl
Lemme tell you
Come baby girl
Lemme tell you
Why these other fools
Can't replace you
Why these other fools
Can't replace you
You're intelligent
Diligent
The whole world knows you're
Magnificent
And your innocence
Is questionable
Which is thrilling and
Leaves no other choice but to get jealous

Chorus:
I get jealous
I get jealous
I get jealous
I get jealous, jealous, jealous (x2)

Bridge:
Boy stay far
Cause my girl a fucking choosy
5-star rating
Cause they watch you like a movie
Cutie, dancing with beast, you are beauty
I even get jealous
When them mutha fuckers fruity

Chorus:
I get jealous
I get jealous
I get jealous
I get jealous, jealous, jealous

Bridge 2:
Talk about your boss
I get lost
In my thoughts
Like why is she on about him
Like he's a god
I might just be delusional
Same thing I cross
Try to cover up these feelings
Like food in a pot

Verse 2:
When you call that boy handsome
To me it's just random
My envy triggers
You just won't see it
Like a phantom
Low key throwing tantrums
Living in the jealousy
Like mansions
But I'd rather show you how I feel
In the jealousy anthem
I know I can't control you
I know I shoulda told you
I know you're gonna say
It's unwise when I approach you
Think about this shit
Every time I get to know you
I trust the nigga more
Than I even trust the old you
Y + 2x = 40
X = 20
Y is my trust score
I know it ain't sporty
So when a nigga chase you
They gonna get bloody
Cause imma get Jealous

Chorus:
I get jealous
I get jealous
I get jealous
I get jealous, jealous, jealous (x2)

Bridge:
Boy stay far
Cause my girl a fucking choosy

Cause they watch you like a movie

I get jealous
I get jealous
I get jealous
I get jealous, jealous, jealous (x2)
