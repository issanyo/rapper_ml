[Hook: Meek Mill & French Montana]
You need that work and I'll be there
(If that money straight)
I'll be there I'll be there
(If that money straight)
I get that work from [?]
(Count my money right)
I'll be there I'll be there
(I said I got my [?])
She want that work and I'll be there
(Fuck her once fuck her twice)
I'll be there I'll be there
That pussy good and I'll be there
I'll be there I'll be there
(Fuck her once fuck her twice)

[Verse 1: Juicy J]
Got 200 on the dash and that 40 on my hip
I got a high class bitch 'bout to gobble on my dick
I bought that lamb and put chrome on her feet she a beast
Rich nigga all I know is cash I don't do no lease
Got that Benz off the floor that bitch ain't even released
Got a crib in the Hills and another on the beach
Cause I hustle like I'm broke slang these records like they dope
And I'm still laughing at you niggas cause your money telling jokes
My new chick a super model tell me how you think I got her
I keep money on my mind all I know is dollars
Hundred grand in my pocket I might throw it all at Follies
Bitch I'm balling like I'm Spalding do it all again tomorrow

[Verse 2: Zoey Dollaz]
That pussy good and I'll be there
No back up cabs I'm in the rear
I gave her that work like Javier
Put in work on your bitch and I"m out of here
I got niggas still they moving that work
I got hitters still they putting in work
All I got to do is just make the call, then nigga you murked
Get my money straight then ball like I'm Kobe
Twenty on the Rollie nigga Ginobili
These niggas steady acting like they know me
Ya'll niggas prolly just on me
If its 'bout bread and I'll be there
I'm always about money you copy that
I run through the money you roger that
I go blow me a check and bring that back and I'm gone
