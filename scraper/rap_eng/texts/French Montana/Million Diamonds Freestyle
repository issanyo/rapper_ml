[Chorus]
Feels like it’s going to flow away from my heart
Because lately I’ve been feeling like I’m free
I feel like give myself a brand new start
I get back to my roots and in me

[Verse1]
Put my back against against the walls
I’ll be smoking that la la
They want to see you down
I think I’m sky high
Wanting the mood hopping out there
Ain’t nothing change niggas don’t pretend
Keeping duck shine feels the diamond freestyle
Getting high it’s looking like I’m Jamaican
All heads up nigga be patient
Now I’m number one on every station
Doing shows on the station island vacation
Trying to make it but never though in a million years
I will make a deal that made niggas millionaire
VS1 diamonds for the rocky days
Was trying to find ways to park
Now he parting ways
Nothing change but a bigger love
Young niggas couln’t work unless you cut stones
We the hottest in the streets dogs
How a mill came from the invisible
Put my back against against the walls
I’ll be smoking that la la
They want to see you down
I think I’m sky high
Wanting the mood hopping out there
Ain’t nothing change niggas don’t pretend
Keeping duck shine feels the diamond freestyle
