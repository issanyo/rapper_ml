[Hook]
I see this thick bad bitch I gotta have (watch me do it)
Hundred cash, look it up in the bag (watch me do it)
Pull up in the big truck, bitches playin' (watch me do it)
Blowin' smoke, double cup, clock em out (watch me do it)
You can love or hate me but you watchin' nigga
You can love or hate me but you watchin' nigga
You can love or hate me but you watchin' nigga
You can love or hate me but you watchin' nigga

[Verse 1]
You can love or hate me, you can hate then love me
You can watch the bitches plus the jewelry on me
You could die tonight, you raise yo hand and touch me
Or you could pray to God and hope yo bitch didn't fuck me
Pistol packin', paper stackin', Brooklyn nigga
Crazy, I've been rollin' on these pussy niggas
Haters starin' at me like see this raw shit
Photo ops, post form, see me poppin'
Started with a dream, nigga watch me do it
Pull up in that thing, they say that's how you do it
I just fucked this game and she let me do it
Oh, she ain't say that we was friends? Man I thought you knew it

[Verse 2]
Hate me but you watch me
Hate me but we poppin'
And all the dough that you make a year, man I can fit it in my pocket
I say tell it to healthy, alive and free
It's all the thing that I need to be
They helped me to make 100 million
Allow me to move 100 keys
I say I'm hustling with my ponta
You disrespect well we shot ya
You violate and we demonstrate
We catch a nigga, we gotcha
We breakin' niggas all proper
We come and chop and clear the house in
Tryna move keys and they don't know the cost
Nigga we gon' wipe yo nose clean
We sell dope but no dope fiend
Fish scale, no triple beam
Check digital, hit 50 cal
Take 50 keys, make 50 mill
I'm tryna ball out like Meech did
And a nigga I be with
I'm certified, not bonified
If you flaw watch me, peace yea
