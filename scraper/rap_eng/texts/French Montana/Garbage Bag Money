[Hook:]
Money in the garbage bag
Money in the garbage bag
We the garbage boys
Money in the garbage bag
Money in the garbage bag
Money in the garbage bag
We the garbage boys
Money in the garbage bag

Transport the work (ha)
Transport the work (ha)
Transport the work (ha)
Money in the garbage bag
Transport the work (ha)
Transport the work (ha)
Transport the work (ha)
Money in the garbage bag

[Verse:]
Six in the corner pass, money in the garbage bag
Nigga on that paper like an autograph, call it fast
Moving all kind of work, told to meet the kindness first
You know we called up all kind of dirt, gotta work
Nigga back against the wall looking like a poster
Supposed to take over the city flood the coast up
Niggers listening my rap, got them knockers on my back
Grinding with a bundle and a chopper on the track
You know homie left a rhymer home, nigga knock your mama off
Shots clear, harder than osama on, Times Square
Patient on time shit, stay in my room, cold waiting
Afraid of seek, sky high, coming soon
Montana!
