[Bridge: French Montana]
Got so high to call mama
So high to call mama
Make a way, let me bust a dance move
Make a way, let me bust a dance move
Pull up on a boulevard
Straight to the point, I don't talk
I got a coupe, I can't park
All my dogs go hard

[Chorus: Quavo]
I threw the money, told her "look back at it"
I threw the money, told her "look back at it"
She make that booty bounce like a jack rabbit
She make that booty bounce like a jack rabbit
She all about the money, I ain't mad at you
She all about the money, I ain't mad at you
If you all 'bout the money, I ain't mad at you
If you all 'bout the money, I ain't mad at you

[Verse 1: Quavo]
I just want to see lil' mama
Bounce that ass like a drummer
Because I got an anaconda
She do what ever I wanna
I wanna go and tell my mama
Her hair so long like Rapunzel
She told me don't eat your lasagna
So I gotta listen to my mama

[Bridge: French Montana]
Got so high to call mama
So high to call mama
Make a way, let me bust a dance move
Make a way, let me bust a dance move
Pull up on a boulevard
Straight to the point, I don't talk
I got a coupe, I can't park
All my dogs go hard

[Chorus: Quavo]
I threw the money, told her "look back at it"
I threw the money, told her "look back at it"
She make that booty bounce like a jack rabbit
She make that booty bounce like a jack rabbit
She all about the money, I ain't mad at you
She all about the money, I ain't mad at you
If you all 'bout the money, I ain't mad at you
If you all 'bout the money, I ain't mad at you

[Verse 2: French Montana]
If you all about the money, I ain't mad at you
Long as I throw it up, you look back at it
Got me coming back like a crack addict
I take a night off and I'm back at it

[Bridge: French Montana]
Got so high to call mama
So high to call mama
Make a way, let me bust a dance move
Make a way, let me bust a dance move
Pull up on a boulevard
Straight to the point, I don't talk
I got a coupe, I can't park
All my dogs go hard

[Chorus: Quavo]
I threw the money, told her "look back at it"
I threw the money, told her "look back at it"
She make that booty bounce like a jack rabbit
She make that booty bounce like a jack rabbit
She all about the money, I ain't mad at you
She all about the money, I ain't mad at you
If you all 'bout the money, I ain't mad at you
If you all 'bout the money, I ain't mad at you
