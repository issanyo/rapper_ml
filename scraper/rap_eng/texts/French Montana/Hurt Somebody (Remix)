[Intro]
Akon
Montana

[Bridge + Hook - Akon]
This concrete’s too cold to be walking on it
Oh yes, walking on it with no shoes on
Don’t wanna struggle oh no
Don’t want it to become a habit
I’d be living in the gutter with no shoes on
Let me get up out of here but alright
Hurt somebody, oh I have to hurt somebody, alright
Hurt somebody, oh I have to hurt somebody, alright
Hurt somebody, oh I have to hurt somebody, alright
Hurt somebody, oh I have to hurt somebody

[Verse 1 - Akon]
My mama need a crib, son need some Jordan’s
This some bullshit, cause I can’t afford it
Band’s listening and the band record it
Trying to flush the pen hoping I survive the morning
It’s getting hot-hot, man I’m talking scorching
Watching bodies drop, trying to make a fortune
Dancing in no pop trying to stick my fork in
Want her on the block? Then you got to put your work in

[Bridge + Hook - Akon]

[Verse 2 - French Montana]
Brother need bail, stead calling
Dreaming out the cell, till he wake up in the morning
Magic warp, always disappears
Smoked got my eyes blurred
But my vision clear
Hot head, but this concrete cold
Titanium bitch i never fold
Never judge a nigga before you judge yourself
You ain’t got to help me
Nigga help yourself
Nigga up in here
I don’t know what they told him
Well tell them I’m the mob
I don’t own them
I’ll take you to the sharks
They can't breathe out the water
I’ll tear your ass apart and put you out of order

[Bridge + Hook - Akon]
