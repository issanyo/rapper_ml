[Intro]
Niggas be talkin that Bonnie & Clyde shit
Man, that’s that movie shit
All I know how to do is keep it 100 with my dogs

[Hook: French Montana]
I love my main piece and my side piece
Niggas acting shady so I’m riding with my lady dog
(Hide em wherever, hide em wherever)
(She know it’s whatever)
(We roll we roll we roll)
(We roll we roll we roll)

[Verse 1: French Montana]
Love a bad bitch get her Celine on
Young Al Green get my lean on
One love, one love
I’m talking Nas illmatic with my semi-automatic
I started from the corner with a warrant, got the city hot
Made mills, label on my back, watch me Diddy Bop
Take that boost, something out the loo
Hopping out the trunk, bumping Boos'
Bad bitches, 6 inch heels, made 6 mills
New jewelry set, cost me 6 deals
Count them hundreds while shorty count 20’s
Shorty keep it a hunnid', it’s all bad cuz he’s bluntin'
I love my main bitch and my side btch
Niggas acting shady so I’m riding with my lady dog
Roof off the Rolls, feel close to God
Fuck all them hoes, you married to the mob

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Fat Joe]
Hermes bracelets to her elbow
Platinum Chanel when a nigga barely sell gold
Back when 5-60 was a Melrose
A nigga dug his way up out the cell ho
Now yellow tape that bitch
Cause girl, you be killin em, they hate that shit
Seen you on Instagram, skiing out in Switzerland
Yea ho, you turned me to a different man
Pull a book off the shelf, the wrong move
It’s big business that make the small moves
On the waterfall, mark a small cruise
My bitch right, I ain’t make a wrong move

[Hook]
