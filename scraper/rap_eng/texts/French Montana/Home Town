[Intro: French Montana, Chinx Drugz]
Said and done, did it for my home town
Thats right
When it's all said and done did it for my home town
When it's all said and done did it for my home town(dollarz where we at!)
When it's all said and done did it for my home town

All the boys wanna basketball play, niggas on the corners, they be hustlin' out here
(Imma coke boy, I'mma coke boy)

All said and done did it for my home town
When it's all said and done did it for my home town

[Verse 1: Chinx Drugz]
Hitting licks up in the game
Them niggas on the other side was tryina' get a name
They say every hood the same, but I beg to differ
New coupe, big slippers, nigga check the wheels
Coke boys major deal sonic, niggas stuff that chronic
Tear your bitch a new hole, knock her out her linings
Getting to that money, cus I work hard, jail left my worst scars
Stacks died, getting over that was my worst job
Panoramic view, see the stars through the ceiling
Your boat sinks when you let a fuck nigga steer it
Sliding on these niggas like theyre' a water park
See that time is money like that audemars, they love me
I went all 4, pool, you ain't got none
Model bitches with me, rolling swishy riding shot gun
I do it big, for my home town, they put it in, but I put it down

[Hook: Adele]
Round my hometown, memories are fresh
Round my hometown, ooh, the people I've met

[Verse 2:French Montana]
You know your boy Fleek, fresher than a new born
Drinking on the brown, with a shawty on nuvo
See me in that two-door, ?????????
High on pluto, told them I'd be back
I never bag sweet, town where I eek
I dog em, head off the flock, then the fleek
Paint the picture perfect, show up this for certain
Square bitches slurping, squares I be serving, Chirp me

I know your nigga phony, hit me if you horny
This rap shit is fugazi, I just do it for my homie
Early in the morning, Through the town I'm roaming
Take your swig ride and all my niggas they be on

When it's all said and done did it for my home town

[Hook: Adele and French Montana]
Round my hometown, memories are fresh
Round my hometown, ooh, the people I've met

When it's all said and done did it for my home town
When it's all said and done did it for my home town
