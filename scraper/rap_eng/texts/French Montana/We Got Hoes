[Verse One: French Montana]
Got 'em hangin off the rope
Live from the coke
Mr. Montana here it's the year for your folks
You say how could you predict it
When poverty restrict it
And old niggas clogging up the arteries
All I needs
Three bad bitches on my lap
Make it clap
Here baby take a stack
Get your hair done
Don't worry where it came from
My head numb
Weed smoke
Weed toke
I'll tella we ride
With the felonies homie
Get caught with it then without it
Drama got me riding with suicide doors thoughts
Tryin' to make it outta court
Got me beggin', for my life
Pissin' all kinda shit
Paranoid tryna tell my lawyer go all out for me
Ride with me
Do the back roll with my windows up
Homie and my hat low
Man it is what you make it
Backblock dice game rolled on
With the hoody on and the ice chain Montana

[Hook: Mike Shorey]
It don't stop we on a mission
Young niggas been getting money I listened
How ya niggas think I got this position
Speaking all facts and fiction?
Don't you know Don't you know
We got dough
And we get low we get low
On that dro
You already know already know
We got hoes
Reek on the low on the low
We get dough
You already know
