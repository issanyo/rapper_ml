Intro

You already kno,wait for you to fall
Im for show, nigga I do my business wit my fellins aside
Yea haaaa, I be the king of that haaa

Verse 1

If you fuck undercover then the pillow talk
I just play my cards nigga, let the dealer talk
All business never let my feelins talk
Nigga moment of silence when them killas talk
Welcome to the hood nigga bread and water
25 for dome nigga its the head quater
Barely prayed nigga but I played hard
I be last to go nigga im the 8 ball
Fuck niggas fuck bitches too
Cause these niggas do the same things bitches do
You overnight homie, let the real tell it
7-5 years nigga fuck wit real felons
Hood phenomenons, same niggas shot me up
Same niggas broke fast wit Ramadan
Nigga I be insane if I think shit the same
Close friends, enemies everyone the same
I'm sayin this how I treat em'
Fuck a bitch, if it ain't money I don't need it

(chorus)
You already kno, we wait for you to fall
Nigga im fo' sho', I do business wit my feelins asidee
