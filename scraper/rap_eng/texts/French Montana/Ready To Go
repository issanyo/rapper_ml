[Chorus]
Yeaaa Im ready to go
Baby no I ain't tryina wait up
I know you you ready to go Ahhh
Ge up outta here, bottles in the air, shots of patron, purple in the air
I have you yelling Yeaa, I'm ready to go ow

[Verse 1]
2 drops, no top and no bikini
Gold watch, Gold chain, Gold lamborghini
Fresh seats, fresh feet, house two storys
I'm all airs, white airs, I dont do maurys
Purple smoke, purple range, purple laker cap
Chain blue like the parking for the handicap
Kinda loopy, but its scary once you tell me take it
Weed, bread, scrambled eggs with the turkey bacon
I wake up in the the morning to a fresh start
Lets talk, countin up the bread be the best part
Yellow mazzaraati coke boys license plate
Nice day, dealing through the hurdles getting life straight

[Chorus]
Yeaaa Im ready to go
Baby no I ain't tryina wait up
I know you you ready to go Ahhh
Ge up outta here, bottles in the air, shots of patron, purple in the air
I have you yelling Yeaa, I'm ready to go ow

[Verse 2]
Her stomach so polluted, toot it then I boot it
Got somethin newer, hop in and shoot up
Get up outta here, high up in the lear
Shots of patron, purple in the air yeaaa
I never wanna go back
You dont tell the radio listen to the throwback, for a fact
Always chasing, never wonder once I get to have it
Egyptian cloth, expensive habbits
Shawty holdin out she ain't tryina make it sleazy
I'm tryina maintain the money cuz I make it easy
Mr. 16 011' why try
Top 5
Connected like wi-fi
Montana

[Chorus] x2
Yeaaa Im ready to go
Baby no I ain't tryina wait up
I know you you ready to go Ahhh
Ge up outta here, bottles in the air, shots of patron, purple in the air
I have you yelling Yeaa, I'm ready to go ow
