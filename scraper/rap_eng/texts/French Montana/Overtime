[Hook: Akon]
It's due or die, gotta go put in overtime
I'm gon put it on the line, on the way, so I'm goin grind
Everytime, everytime
Overtime
Overtime

[Verse 1: French Montana]
Montana!
Started with a vision, that body in Heni
I'm that igga you need, got that gram in
With a nigga slippin off, your bitch slippin off
Montana slicker than Edgiption cloth
Imma ball on you niggas till the end
Hold it down, my nigga Max hit the can
Keep the soul, keep the devil in
Niggas get shot, pop pop
Pain for the radeo, streets ain't got it
Got that cheese, 20,000 sold
I'm that new nigga now
It's funny how it go
G4 live
And I been that nigga, right
Way before Cam got signed

[Hook: Akon]
It's due or die, gotta go put in overtime
I'm gon put it on the line, on the way, so I'm goin grind
Everytime, everytime
Overtime
Overtime
