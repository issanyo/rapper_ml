[Pre-Chorus: Charli XCX]
Woooh, tell me what you want and I can do it to you
I'm a million dollars, make your wishes come true
Calling out you're, calling out, calling out you're
Never seen a girl like this before

[Chorus: Charli XCX]
If you wanna pu-pu-pu-pu-put it on me
You're not gonna ge-ge-ge-ge-get it for free
Come on spend that dirty sexy money on me, on me, on me
You got to pull up, pull up, pull up, pull up
You got to pull up, pull up, pull up, pull up
You got to pull up, pull up, pull up, pull up

[Chorus: Charli XCX]
If you wanna pu-pu-pu-pu-put it on me
You're not gonna ge-ge-ge-ge-get it for free
Come on spend that dirty sexy money on me, on me, on me
You got to pull up, pull up, pull up, pull up...
Pull up, pull up, pull up, pull up...
Dirty sexy money

[Outro]
I do it on, and on, and on, and on, and on
All on me, dirty sexy money
I do it on, and on, and on, and on, and on
All on me, dirty sexy (if you wanna)
Woooh, woooh, woooh
Oooh, woooh
