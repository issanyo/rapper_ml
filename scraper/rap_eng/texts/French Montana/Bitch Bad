If your bitch ain't smellin' like money, she counterfeit

[Hook: French Montana & DJ Khaled]
Damn that bitch bad and she smellin' like money (Trina)
Damn that bitch bad and she smellin' like money (Trina)
Damn that bitch bad and she smellin' like money (Trina)
Damn that bitch bad and she smellin' like money (Let's go)
That bitch bad (bitch bad), that bitch bad (bitch bad)
That bitch bad (bitch bad), that bitch bad (bitch bad)
Work it out (that bitch bad), poke it out (that bitch bad), burn it up (that bitch bad), work it up (that bitch bad)

[Verse 1: Trina]
Bitch bad, a hundred K, in the bag
Couple M's in the stash, bum bitches, you gotta laugh
Slim waste, fat ass, all real, you hoes mad
You went broke - too bad, I'm in the 'Rari or the Lamb'
Switchin' lanes, train B, bad bitches my whole team
Brain stupid, hair game mean
He fuck once, he bought a ring
That bitch bad

[Hook: French Montana & DJ Khaled]
Damn that bitch bad and she smellin' like money (hah)
Damn that bitch bad and she smellin' like money (hah)
Damn that bitch bad and she smellin' like money (hah)
Damn that bitch bad and she smellin' like money
That bitch bad (bitch bad), that bitch bad (bitch bad)
That bitch bad (bitch bad), that bitch bad (bitch bad)
Work it out (that bitch bad), poke it out (that bitch bad), burn it up (that bitch bad), work it up (that bitch bad)

[Verse 2: Trina]
Bitch bad, [?] bag, full of cash
DJ bring it back, stop hating, you a fan
Ros√© in my glass, you know Benz, make a dance
PJ's, they land, Dade county, to Japan
Different plane, train B, bad bitches, whole team
It's a movie I din't main see
In Alexander, down McQueen

[Hook: French Montana & DJ Khaled]
Damn that bitch bad and she smellin' like money (hah)
Damn that bitch bad and she smellin' like money (hah)
Damn that bitch bad and she smellin' like money (hah)
Damn that bitch bad and she smellin' like money
