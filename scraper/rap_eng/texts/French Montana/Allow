[Intro: French Montana]
Montana
You know what it is when you hear that haan
Aye, aye, aye

[Verse 1: Nasty C]
My standards are hella stone
My safe is a treasure trove
My wagon full of yellow bones
I'm about to go Hefner on 'em
If she take the shot then we gon' miss them, hold up
Call the shots like I miss 'em, don't I?
Snake niggas talk a lot of shit, and I said I know when I hear a hissing cobra
I know, I know when I see a rat
I go on 'em when I see the racks
Pick up the commas like I can't read for jack
And send it home and tell 'em Christmas is back
Yeah, It's a new sea on the map
Calling me out, to me is a prank
Calling me out, to me is a trap
Calling me out, I'ma call you back

[Chorus: Nasty C]
Young nigga put in the grind (I work)
I shine, I shine (I shine)
I take your girl from the crowd (crowd, crowd)
She down, she down (she down)
They tryna come to the house (to the cribo)
Allow, allow (allow)
She take the dick then she bow (then she bow)
She bow, she bow
Young nigga put in the grind (I work)
I shine, I shine (I shine)
I take your girl from the crowd (crowd, crowd)
She down, she down (she down)
They tryna come to the house (to the cribo)
Allow, allow (allow)
She take the dick then she bow (then she bow)
She bow, she bow

I was cooking up til dawn
Now the diamonds dancing tryna charm me
These bitches used to never want me
Now they pop their ankles, how they falling

[Verse 3: French Montana]
Montana
I was on the block til the morning
Sipping that Ciroc til the morning
I need to hop in the foreign
Chain iced to the arm
I'm talking John Wall
Still ride with the warrant
I'm talking Paul Wall
Balling like Paul George

[Verse 4: Nasty C]
I'm talking George Foreman, yeah that's the grill talk
The jewelry add up to a mil' talk
Put it on and tell me how it feel talk
Yeah, yeah

Yeah, my plug is my pilot (salute)
He say, "where is we flying?"
I said fuck it I haven't decided

Dropping the top, getting the wop

[Chorus: Nasty C]
Young nigga put in the grind (I work)
I shine, I shine (I shine)
I take your girl from the crowd (crowd, crowd)
She down, she down (she down)
They tryna come to the house (to the cribo)
Allow, allow (allow)
She take the dick then she bow (then she bow)
She bow, she bow
Young nigga put in the grind (I work)

[Bridge: Nasty C]
I made the money, I made a difference
I made 'em talk, I made 'em listen
I made 'em wish and switch sides
Made these motherfuckers hate the bands
Made 'em call me lucky like I didn't force myself to stay up working
Rappers smoking, drinking yeah
I made the money, I made a difference
I made 'em talk, I made 'em listen
I made 'em wish and switch sides
Made these motherfuckers hate the bands
Made 'em call me lucky like I didn't force myself to stay up working
Rappers smoking, drinking yeah

[Chorus: Nasty C]
Young nigga put in the grind
I shine, I shine
I take your girl from the crowd
She down, she down
They tryna come to the house
Allow, allow
She take the dick then she bow
She bow, she bow
Young nigga put in the grind
I shine, I shine
I take your girl from the crowd
She down, she down
They tryna come to the house
Allow, allow
She take the dick then she bow
She bow, she bow
