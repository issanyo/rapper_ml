If I die-ie-ie-ie-ie
Probably die as a young nigga
Probably die as a young nigga
If I die-ie-ie-ie-ie
Probably die as a young nigga
Probably die as a young nigga

[Post-Hook: French Montana]
If I die, just look into the sky
I ain’t even gon’ lie, tell my niggas don’t cry bout nothing
Oh, Montana
If there’s something on my mind, I was busy tryna find
I was drunk getting high with my guys didn't care 'bout nothing
Whoa

[Verse 1: French Montana]
Ever since the first hit me up, I wasn't supposed to live
Still on the block getting money where I’m supposed to live
Want to see my casket shine on mama’s front row
Tears in her eyes, heart bleeding, the boy have to go
I can see Puff telling Ross, Yela was a legend
I can see my baby mama mad at every freshman
And I’d be mad
Turning up for my nigga till they put me in the casket

[Hook: Meet Sims]
If I die-ie-ie-ie-ie
Probably die as a young nigga
Probably die as a young nigga
If I die-ie-ie-ie-ie
Probably die as a young nigga
Probably die as a young nigga

[Post-Hook: French Montana]
If I die, just look into the sky
I ain’t even gon’ lie, tell my niggas don’t cry bout nothing
If there’s something on my mind, I was busy tryna find
I was drunk getting high with my guys didn't care 'bout nothing

[Verse 2: Zack Kharbouch]
Suckas hating, we just some young niggas
Out the bottom, got it from crumbs nigga
Now it’s 250 in the slum nigga
Pocket full and this shit for fun nigga
Say never know
All this shit a nigga seen, I’ll never fold
May never know
Niggas claiming like a lawyer, probably telling though
Young niggas out here let the blammer go
Mixing mud with the smoke, I’m paranoid
Got a couple kittens that’s down to go
And when they cum I’ll be there mining coal
Suckas living a lie
Out here blessing all my niggas and I’m living the life
Got a couple foreign bitches and they put up a fight
If I told you what I know I’m probably doing a life
Fuck these fuck niggas, we don’t run with em
Hating bitches, man I’m done with em
Live fast and die young nigga
Know the consequences come with it

[Hook: Meet Sims]
If I die-ie-ie-ie-ie
Probably die as a young nigga
Probably die as a young nigga
If I die-ie-ie-ie-ie
Probably die as a young nigga
Probably die as a young nigga

[Verse 3: Chinx]
Look, rose up out that dirt wearing holy clothes
Most niggas love to hate you, man you don’t need those niggas
How we gon’ cleanse our body of these sins?
When our only concern was re-ing up and riding rims
Sold white that wasn’t good for cooking
Teacher used to say that I’d amount to nothing (stupid bitch)
Kept the work up in that kitchen covered
Whipped it like I baked it in that easy oven
Everybody pick their poison, Islamic or Christian
Buddhas to Jewish, every religion is Judas
Nigga due to all my circumstances
Had no choice but roll the dice, had to take them chances
Till my homies leave the can they just tuna fish
New money orders for the fam, just get through the shit
Youngins dying nowadays dressed up in the ghetto
The struggle up out the system, these crackers turn you to Gepetto
I’m loading up in that hoopty to catch a 187
I flipped and got me a Rolex, preacher got the same Bezel
What the fuck, some nights I couldn’t sleep cause Satan woke me up
Been through shit that make you cry, have you choking up
Find yourself in the darkest places loading them nines
Tryna grip your mind, searching, you search what you find
Came up with jack shit up out that wishing well
Left with this black skin and a digital scale
I pray I be ok when I grow up a little bigger
If I don’t, tell my babies daddy was a real nigga

[Hook: Meet Sims]
If I die-ie-ie-ie-ie
Probably die as a young nigga

If I die-ie-ie-ie-ie
Probably die as a young nigga
Probably die as a young nigga
