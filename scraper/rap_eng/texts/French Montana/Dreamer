[Intro: Tweezie]
And so I'm a dreamer
And so I'm a dreamer

[Hook: Tweezie]
Now all I do is ball
Now all I do is ball
Now all I do is ball
Cause I ain't end up in that ah-ah-aisle
Now all I do is ball
Now all I do is ball
Now all I do is ball
Cause I ain't end up in that oh-oh-oh

[Verse 1: Maino]
How you want it, how you want it
All I see is Ghosts and Phantoms, my life haunted
How you want it, how you want it
Started from the bottom, I made it barely with nothing
Now I'm waking up when I (feel like it)
Going by when I (feel like it)
Fly where ever I (feel like it)
Wino (cause I feel like it)
I went to sleep with them Bugatti dreams
Shorty got a dirty mouth, but that punani clean
Talking rags to riches, diamonds on ashy wristses
Models and actresses, now they the average bitches
Yeah, you now rolling with the mafia
Matte black Ghost, biscuit in and ride with us

[Pre-Hook: Tweezie]
So I'm a dreamer
I want it all, man I come from the bottom
I ain't had nothing at all
And so I'm a dreamer
I want it all
Man I be going off
Cause I ain't going back to poor

[Verse 2: French Montana]
I had a dream, Martin Luther King
I was Pablo Escobar when he got them things
I was Michael Jordan when he got them rings
I was Usain Bolt when he got them chains
I was Vince Carter on the fast break
Marley, on his last take
Puff, when he had Ma$e
All we had was hope, all we had was dope
Look at the crib, look at the boat
Look at the car, baby, watch it grow wings
They say when you make money, you gon' lose friends
Well fuck em all, motherfuck them all
We was never friends anyway, nigga watch me ball

[Verse 3: B.o.B.]
When you come from where we come from
You get used to feeling hunger
You get used to the feeling of pain
The villan that reigns, of being a number
These influences that I'm under
These phone bills that I run up
From the Netherlands to downtown Japan
To Australia pimping down under
You can probably tell that I'm high
By the way a nigga fell from the sky
Every story that I tell, you can tell if it's real
You can tell if it's not
You can tell that I lived every moment
Most niggas gonna try to sell you a plot
You can tell that the fucks that I don't give
Never went broke since I failed junior high
How ironic is it, you like, wow, that's some decision
But look at how I came up, that's what they call commitment
By far no competition to a nigga's disposition
How ya want it, how ya want it?
Bitch, I flaunt it cause I did it
Ya bish!
