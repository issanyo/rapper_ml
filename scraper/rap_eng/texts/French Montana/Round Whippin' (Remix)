[Chorus: A.Chal]
I've been goin' 'round whippin'
All through the night, me with a
A two seater like round whippin'
I'm gon' get it right, gon' get it right
I've been goin' 'round whippin'
All through the night, me with a
Montana
A two seater like round whippin'
I'm gon' get it right, gon' get it right

[Verse 1: French Montana]
Ridin' 'round the block and it's around one
Yo where you at?
And shorty gon' boof it if the cops come
Hold me down, that's my babe
I'm workin' miracles with the mayo
My youngins shootin' like O.J. Mayo
With Mansour in San Diego
And everything's paid for (fosho)

[Chorus: French Montana]
'Cause I be ridin' 'round whippin' (skrrrt)
I got the whole team wit me
Cup full of lean, sippin' (hann)
We be ridin' through these streets, grippin'
Ridin' in the foreign car sippin', feelin' woozy
Baby be my porn star, we can make a movie
Baby, let's get faded
My crib gated... with my lady

[Chorus: A.Chal & French Montana]
I've been goin' 'round whippin' (skrrt, skrrt)
All through the night, me with a
A two seater like round whippin'
I'm gon' get it right, gon' get it right
I've been goin' 'round whippin'
All through the night, me with a
A two seater like round whippin'
I'm gon' get it right, gon' get it right

[Verse 2: A.Chal]
Speedin' down Pacific like a bullet
If cops come then we gotta lose 'em
On this road they love to hate on you
But I'ma just keep on cruisin'
After hours off La Brea
Top down, but that's just how I stay up
These lazy mothafuckas want a lay up
See you later

[Chorus: A.Chal]
I've been goin' 'round whippin'
All through the night, me with a
A two seater like round whippin'
I'm gon' get it right, gon' get it right
I've been goin' 'round whippin'
All through the night, me with a
A two seater like round whippin'
I'm gon' get it right, gon' get it right

[Bridge: A.Chal]
California dreamin'
Long nights, long weekend
45 at least and
We gon' go up (oh yeah, oh yeah)

[Chorus: A.Chal]
I've been goin' 'round whippin' (California dreamin')
All through the night, me with a (Long nights, long weekend)
A two seater like round whippin' (45 at least and)
I'm gon' get it right, gon' get it right (We gon' go up)
I've been goin' 'round whippin'
All through the night, me with a
A two seater like round whippin'
I'm gon' get it right, gon' get it right
