[Hook]
We did it again, once again
I'm so special, ooooh
You know we love you, love you, love you, long time (Montana!)
You know we love you, love you, love you, long time

[Verse]
Big .44, no safety
You'll collapse like JoJo, K-Ci
And my ice like lights from AC
Homie I'm hot like a drop, no AC
They wanna freestyle, I'm tryna stay free
And my coupe all blue like Grape Street
From eight blocks, I take shots, HD
I'll blast, you'll dash like Stacey
But look akh, I can't stop, I'm waist-deep
Fuck crossing over, I'mma stay street
Nigga I'm good, I'm what the hood made me
I got guns, 7 inches to 8 feet
You ain't Pac, you ain't Fif', you ain't Jay-Z
You ain't Yay', you ain't French, you ain't wavy
For my Coke Boys, shoot a nigga face off
In the bookings, they made me take my lace off
And my belt, and the voucher for my cake, boss
You know I'm on top of beef like steak sauce
A1, since day one, I caked off
Still slang that 'caine and that haze dog
It's a new religion, my jeans True Religion
Homie scramble with notes, I'm New Edition
Got that Hefty, garbage bread
I'm in the backseat gettin' that Harvard head
Swaggalicious, with a bag of bitches
This food for thought, and they got the dishes
Nigga don't clean the pots, that coke residue
This that crack cocaine for you to listen to
