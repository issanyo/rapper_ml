[Intro: French Montana]
Montana
You know what it is
When you hear that haa
Alma

[Chorus: Alma]
We got too drunk, we got too high
On the night we graduated
We got locked up in my bedroom
And I swear I didn't fake it
We got too drunk, we got too high
Fell in love when we were faded
Don't make this complicated
You were just one of my phases, oh yeah

[Verse 1: Alma]
I drank all the liquor
Then you gave me yours
Then we started talking
And you kinda turned me on
Telling stupid stories
Of my history
So I guess it was my fault
That I made you think of me

[Pre-Chorus: Alma]
I'm sorry if I hurt you
I just don't like you like that

[Chorus: Alma]
We got too drunk, we got too high
On the night we graduated
We got locked up in my bedroom
And I swear I didn't fake it
We got too drunk, we got too high
Fell in love when we were faded
Don't make this complicated
You were just one of my phases, oh yeah

[Post-Chorus: Alma]
You, you
You were just one of my phases, oh yeah
You, you
You were just one of my phases, oh yeah

[Verse 2: Alma]
I kept your number
Never hit delete
But when I take too much
I just think of you and me
On the kitchen counter
On the balcony
But when I get sober
You're not the one for me

[Pre-Chorus: Alma & French Montana]
I'm sorry if I hurt you
I just don't like you like that
Hey, hey
You know your boy, Montana

[Verse 3: French Montana & Alma]
It was just a thang, wasn't 'bout the fame
Other last name or a 100-carat ring, and uh
I was wasted, rocks in the bracelet
CÃ®roq in the case
Back to them cases, front 'em to your eyes
Nothing that make shit
Big 'Hypnotize,' and uh
Spend a lifetime in one night
No the data ain't worth one byte
Trips to the valley, palm trees; Cali
For the freaks, I'm a sinner
South beach winters, and I
I don't like you like that
And I know you ain't like that
But I know we just met

[Chorus: Alma]
We got too drunk, we got too high
On the night we graduated
We got locked up in my bedroom
And I swear I didn't fake it
We got too drunk, we got too high
Fell in love when we were faded
Don't make this complicated
You were just one of my phases, oh yeah

[Post-Chorus: Alma]
You, you
You were just one of my phases, oh yeah
You, you
You were just one of my phases, oh yeah

[Outro: Alma]
One of my, one of my, one of my phases, phases
You, you, you, you, you, you, yeah
One of my, one of my, one of my phases, phases
You, you, you, you, you, you, yeah
(You, you, you)
