[Intro: J. Cole]
It's a real nigga revolution, real nigga revolution
It should not be televised

[Chorus]
Now let me see them fucking
Diamonds, diamonds, diamonds, diamonds
Diamonds, diamonds
Now let me see them fucking
Diamonds, diamonds, diamonds, diamonds
Diamonds, diamonds

[Verse 1: J. Cole]
Now on some sweet shit I want my kisses when I want them
On some freak shit I want my dick sucked when I want it
On some G Shit I got my chips up now I’m balling
On some Keith Sweat, I sang them bitches get to falling, on some Ville shit
Made to ball like a goalie net
On some real shit ain't set the time on my Rollie yet - foolish nigga
Always been the coolest nigga, way before you knew this nigga
I went to school with niggas, snatched they bitch then tutor niggas
My hoes smoke, I watch them, don’t roll the blunts I just cop them
Feed her shots of the vodka, she open up like a locker
She a bougie chick, seen every flick at the Oscars
She say I'm just like Sinatra, her pops is into the opera
Well look here my dear I’m the Pavarotti of rhymers
In a brand new Maserati how paparazzi gon’ find us
With my windows tinted like a limo, this is where I write my demo
Duckin' the devil you could say I live my life in limbo

[Bridge: French Montana]
Now let me see them fuckin diamonds, neck full of diamonds, bracelet full of diamonds
Watch full of diamonds, rings full of diamonds
You know I be shinin, drippin in diamonds
Bitches love them diamonds, now throw up all ya motherfuckin diamonds

[Chorus]
Now let me see them fucking
Diamonds, diamonds, diamonds, diamonds
Diamonds, diamonds
Now let me see them fucking
Diamonds, diamonds, diamonds, diamonds
Diamonds, diamonds

[Verse 2: Rick Ross]
Rose from the bottom, I brush dust the dirt off my shoulders
Pinky ring got a boulder, that bitch cost 10 Corollas
Get so swizz on the beats - I’m so swift with a freak
Know I’m draped like a king, strapped with Iron Sheik
Call my chick Cleopatra, she got rings on her toes
Kings living forever I die embalm me in gold
All the bad bitches mourn, somebody sing me a song
Let the kids touch my casket make sure my neck full of stones
Put my face on that cheddar, got big stones in my bezel
Friends come and they go but a diamond forever
Make sure this car ride slow, Rozay, J.Cole
Got 3 mill on my neck, red suede Kangol

[Bridge: French Montana]
Now let me see them fuckin diamonds, neck full of diamonds, bracelet full of diamonds
Watch full of diamonds, rings full of diamonds
You know I be shinin, drippin in diamonds
Bitches love them diamonds, now throw up all ya motherfuckin diamonds

[Chorus]
Now let me see them fucking
Diamonds, diamonds, diamonds, diamonds
Diamonds, diamonds
Now let me see them fucking
Diamonds, diamonds, diamonds, diamonds
Diamonds, diamonds

[Verse 3: French Montana]
Neck full of diamonds, wrist worth an island
40 niggas strapped up - Yeah 49ers
40/40 bank 40 commas
Give them 40 cash and 40 on consignment, (haaanhh)
Diamonds we got mills on, connected like a jail phone
Shorty want to ride it on top with her heels on
Playin with them falcons like I’m from Decatur
Different zip code every if you talk about my neighbor nigga!
You know we play with different paper nigga
Staples Center, get your head full of staples nigga
I’m talking Paul Pierce with the handle nigga
And all my diamonds clear like a sample nigga
