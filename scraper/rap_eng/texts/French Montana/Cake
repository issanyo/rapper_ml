[Hook: French Montana]
Bust a dance move
Pop a bottle, pop a tag and bust a dance move
Bust a dance move, like a damn fool
Do the money dance, hundred racks a watch
Hundred grand, tell em' bring em' out
Pop a bottle, pop a tag and bust a dance move
Bust a dance move, bust a dance move

[Verse 1: Wale]
Look, look
Yeah lot of strong
All up in they v.i
Smokin' on what seems to be loud
Iâ€™m lookin' like Mr. Miya
Lot of shones
Nigga can't you tell that we high ?
And before I leave, I'll peace out
Let me see that camel, 3 times
Slight work though, nightwork though, my girl don't
Y'all girl go where my girl go and you there alone
2 nights, made a hundred grand
Pair of Nikes like one to ten
It was hustle time and y'all walked it out
When the money right, y'all runnin' man
Pullin up the whole ?
Geechin' out with no cataract
If you could understand what this watch cost
You would understand why I ain't tryna dap
Me and him cannot shake hands, why trap when I'm a free man ?
You so a loss, you a robot, who done told y'all niggas to break dance ?

[Hook: French Montana]
Pop a bottle, pop a tag and bust a dance move
Bust a dance move, like a damn fool
Do the money dance, hundred racks a watch
Hundred grand, tell em' bring em' out
Pop a bottle, pop a tag and bust a dance move
Bust a dance move, bust a dance move
Shorty pop a pill, pop that pussy, bust a dance move
Bust a dance move, bust a dance move

[Verse 2: Fabolous]
The NFL must think I'm a damn fool
Every time I touch down, I bust a dance move
They use to have a movement, now they can't move
Used to be on that grizzly like van couv
Bout' to make a Rams move, L.A to ST.LOU
Say you got them toys, that santa story just ain't true
Say you get this money, I'm no snitch I can't tell
Call me MC Hammer, name a bitch that I ain't nail
Can't touch this, you know that you can't touch this
All black jewelry, now that should do it justice
Told her come and bust this, you look like you does this
Come and rub my head girl, teach me how to Douglas

[Hook: French Montana]
Pop a bottle, pop a tag and bust a dance move

Do the money dance, hundred racks a watch
Hundred grand, tell em' bring em' out
Pop a bottle, pop a tag and bust a dance move
Bust a dance move, bust a dance move
Shorty pop a pill, pop that pussy, bust a dance move
Bust a dance move, bust a dance move
