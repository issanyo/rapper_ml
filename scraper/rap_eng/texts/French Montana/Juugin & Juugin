[Hook: Young Life]
Juggin' and juggin' it
Send in your order, I'm cookin' it
Bodied out there like bullet tints
Say it's like readin' a book again
Juggin' and juggin' it
Cookin' it, cookin' it
Juggin' it, juggin' it
Cookin' it, cookin' it
Juggin' and juggin' it
Send in your order, I'm cookin' it
Bodied out there like bullet tints
Say it's like readin' a book again
Juggin' and juggin' it
Cookin' it, cookin' it
Juggin' it, juggin' it
Cookin' it, cookin' it

Chop a nigga down so the coffin fit

Niggas see me on my grind so they hate
Put a bullet in your brain where the [?]
No bullshit I just got the packs son, y'all niggas ain't get that
You'd think that fuck nigga riding, the way that it kickback
I hustle no [?], I hustle and flip that
Going off them bars she breaking my Kit-Kat's
How about them pills, I sell them like Tic-Tac's
When I drop the top then hit the gas, I tell that hoe sit back
A hundred degrees, she feeling the breeze, she holding the
