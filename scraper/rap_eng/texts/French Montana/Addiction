(Verse)
Only thing I wanna do is come over and lay with you at night
I don’t wanna waste no time, the mood is right
I just wanna come over and lay with you tonight
I'ma do what's on my mind

(Pre-Hook)
It’s when I lay my body
Next to yours, you got me
Addicted to your love
Boy, you got me

(Hook)
Addicted, addicted
I’m your, your
Addiction, addiction
You’re my, my
(Heroine and cocaine
I know you’re not good for me
But I don’t wanna go away)

(Verse)
All day, I just been thinking about getting you all day
I didn’t even wanna think about you today
But you was running through my mind anyway
And I just wanna lay my body next to yours, you got me
Addicted to your love, boy, you got me

(Pre-Hook)
It’s when I lay my body
Next to yours, you got me
Addicted to your love
Boy, you got me

(Hook)
Addicted, addicted
I’m your, your
Addiction, addiction
You’re my, my
(Heroine and cocaine
I know you’re not good for me
But I don’t wanna go away)

(Verse: French Montana)
What’up Cassie, baby, when I land I’m gonna holla
Addicted like that cocaine they be folding in that dollar
That Special K, that heroine, got two watches, about eight chains
Got four cribs, about two planes, that space ship like Bruce Wayne
That slur in my talk, see that pimp in my walk
I be the prince in my city and you know we run New York
From that corner block to the big house
Hundred bottles stand on the couch
Now on them blogs when I read about you
Can’t be with you, can’t be without you
Damn, this shit cray’, we getting wasted
Pour it up, money grown up, shit done changed, I done blown up
But shawty kept it hundred next to me
But dollar signs is all that I can see

(Hook)
Addicted, addicted
Addicted, addicted
Addicted, addicted
Addicted, addicted
