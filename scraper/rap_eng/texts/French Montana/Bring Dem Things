[Intro: Pharrell Williams, French Montana, & Fanesha Fabre]
Montana
I be like, nice P, you know
What up P?
Skateboard!
La Musica de Harry Fraud
Skate on these niggas

[Chorus: Kid Daytona]
When I pull up they notice me
Come and talk to me like Jodeci
But don't you be too close to me
Them goons you see, let it go for me
I bring them things, I bring them things
I call the plug (hello?) he bring them things
Mucho bitches, I bring them tings
Looking so expensive, rings and things
I bring them things
I bring them things
I bring them things
I bring them things

[Verse 1: Pharrell Williams]
Mane, you don't wanna fuck with them bro
Oh you high and they shooting, better get low
Extort 'em, you ain't go no friends, oh
They'll be fucking with that ass like a nympho
Chanel scarf like rainbow barf
$1000 sip nigga, this ain't yo' cloth
You ain't dripping nigga, that ain't no sauce
I can see the noodles, that shit made for poodles
I'm thinking 'bout the LaFerrari coupe
1.8, the option is the roof
Greens is a secret to the youth
Your goals are malnourished nigga, please spit the juice
Y'all be Bapein', I be human-made and
Y'all be APin', I'm Richard Mille nation
No diamonds, just tourbillon facing
With gears and sprockets with the sapphire casing'
(Skatebord)

[Chorus: Kid Daytona]
When I pull up they notice me
Come and talk to me like Jodeci
But don't you be too close to me
Them goons you see, let it go for me
I bring them things, I bring them things
I call the plug (hello?) he bring them things
Mucho bitches, I bring them tings
Looking so expensive, rings and things
I bring them things
I bring them things
I bring them things
I bring them things

[Verse 2: French Montana]
Here's a little story about a kid from Morocco
Had to show Carlito I was Benny Blanco
Check it out, ra-raindrop, offset
Fuck a plug, we the outlet
Try put me in a box, I'm in the box office
All the rocks made shawty blow my socks off
Coke boy white, Mac Miller, Reggie Miller
Shoot to kill her, canary quarterback , Steelers
White villa from crack dealing
Now CÃ®roc French Vanilla, garage like a dealer
I kill 'em softly, Lauryn Hill 'em
Get above 'em, crib Calabasas on the hill, I
Had 'em on a needle, 45 plate
Beatles wore revolvers on the red carpet
Alcatraz bars, crash cars
Ain't no future in fronting, my homie rip yo mask off

[Chorus: Kid Daytona]
When I pull up they notice me
Come and talk to me like Jodeci
But don't you be too close to me
Them goons you see, let it go for me
I bring them things, I bring them things
I call the plug (hello?) he bring them things
Mucho bitches, I bring them tings
Looking so expensive, rings and things
I bring them things
I bring them things
I bring them things
I bring them things
