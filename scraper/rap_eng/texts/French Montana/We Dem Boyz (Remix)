[Intro: Wiz Khalifa and (Diddy)]
Hold up, hold up, hold, up
Hold up, hold up, hold, up
We dem boyz
(Yeah, ayo, turn this shit up
Ayo what up Wiz?
You knew someone had to motherfucking remix this shit)

[Chorus: Meek Mill]
Hold up, hold up, hold, up
We them boyz
Hold up, hold up, hold, up
We them boyz
Hold up, hold up, hold, up
We makin' noise
Matter fact I’m a grown ass man, nigga, kill the noise

[Verse 1: Meek Mill]
Been in the corner and shining the street
Nothing can come in between
Me and my money, I get to the that money
I flip through that money, a fuckin’ machine
Look at the haters, I see that they hate us
A pull up in somethin', with somethin' that's mean With somethin' that's fly
Leave with your bitch she won’t tell you goodbye
Like hold up, wait a minute
Pussy so good that I stayed up in it
It was so good that I paid to hit it
I paid to visit, got paid to visit
I walked through the club with a parade of niggas
You are not liked cause you paid them niggas
I’m in L.A with them Haiti niggas
Mexican, Blood, and some Grapestreet niggas
Like hold up
We was them niggas before them niggas was signed
Hold up
Sexing them women before that you knew they was fuckin'
Hold up
Me and my niggas we run through that money, it’s nothin’
You was that talk shit all summer
Lookin’ for niggas with large numbers

[Chorus: Meek Mill]
Hold up, hold up, hold, up
We them boyz
Hold up, hold up, hold, up
We them boyz
Hold up, hold up, hold, up
We makin' noise
Matter fact I’m a grown ass man, nigga, kill the noise

[Verse 2: Diddy and (Meek Mill)]
Hold up, hold up, pop the bottle
Hold up, I sip Ciroc like it's Moscato
Hold up, hold up, I like them blasian and mulatto
Hold up, what the fuck? You ain't got this in your serato?
Hold up, my neck looking like I stole something
Got your favorite rapper asking ''can I hold something?''
In the back of the back and we back in the back in the backseat, the Rolls coming
(When the racks and the racks and the stacks and the stacks and the hoes comin’ )
Give me head, I think she know something
Screaming that ‘’I love you, papi, like my old woman’’
I got old problems spending all this old money
Bread been sitting out so long I call it more money
Hold up, wait a minute
(We caking nigga, look at the way that we pay for niggas
Feel like a bus ‘cause I paid you niggas)
Paid you niggas, you ungrateful niggas
(I’m about to start making you pay for bitches)
Turning my swagger up, raised you niggas, it’s Diddy

[Chorus: Meek Mill]
Hold up, hold up, hold, up
We them boyz
Hold up, hold up, hold, up
We them boyz
Hold up, hold up, hold, up
We makin' noise
Matter fact I’m a grown ass man, nigga, kill the noise

[Verse 3: French Montana]
(Haaan) We eating healthy, nigga
Got your favourite rapper asking for a selfie, nigga
(Haaan) You can’t be serious
Deny my visa missed that marriage up in Paris
Hold up, hold up, young nigga gettin’ money like Pappy Mason
Hold up, hold up, young nigga grinding like bad braces
And every time you see me I’m on TV, TMZ, Lamborghini
Bare bitch with no bikini, Mussolini (haaan)
You talking to them boys
Hold up, running out your mouth, niggas sniffing boy
Hold up, hold up, getting dirty money yelling ‘’fuck the Forbes’’
Hold up, I’mma keep it wavy ‘til they free my boys
(Who that, Max B?) Yeah, nigga that’s my boy
Hold up, Dream team, nigga, we them boys
Wait a minute
Chinx, Meek, Durk, Puff, nigga, we the realest

[Chorus: Meek Mill]
Hold up, hold up, hold, up
We them boyz
Hold up, hold up, hold, up
We them boyz
Hold up, hold up, hold, up
We makin' noise
Matter fact I’m a grown ass man, nigga, kill the noise

[Outro]
(Oh my God that was amazing)
Your bitch know it
