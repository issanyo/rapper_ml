[Verse 1]
And I had a dream
About my old school
And she was there all pink and gold and glittery
I threw my arms around her legs
(This the intro!)
Came to me, came to me
Welcome in your dream
Turn a rich nigga nightmare
Check, Montana, cheese, flip, dream team
Montana!
There they go
Can't fuck with us man

[Chorus]
We the hottest in the game, how I feel
You ain't fuckin' with my team's how I feel
You tell your bitch I call her when I feel
Kill you fuck niggas every time I feel like it
Living for the knife
And I don't give a fuck if it's only for the night, dog
Feelin' it
About the time to go in
Nigga this that dope boy eh
Dog, feeling it
About the time to go in
Montana!

[Verse 2]
Start to do or die, not endorse suicide
Laws get you crucified, niggas choosing sides
Climbing up the ladder with a bladder full of drank
Work in the attic, mathematics fuck the bags
Can't die with it, all this money I'mma blow
I'mma stack it to the ceiling that Ferrari say hello
Baby mama drama, hundred missed calls
Niggas talking about their drama, I wake up in the morn nigga
Everybody whining, can I live?
Give a fuck about your mom's how I feel
When you ballin' everybody want a part nigga
But even your shadow gon' leave you when it's dark nigga
Can't beat it, I'm what the game needed
Told my nigga boss Don gon take it to trial, beat it
Nothing to lose, tattoos around my gull wound
Gonna point the best out and we gon' run through em
And they gon' get it how it's coming to em
His own mama won't recognize him, what is done to him
Back against the wind, just me against the world baby
Body numb, full of drugs, help my nerves baby
Montana Mike when it's crunch time
I done seen death twice, ducking 1 time

[Bridge]
PJ's to the PJ
Can't fuck with us man
You niggas washed up
Niggas don't wanna wake up and look like him
Donkey

[Chorus]
We the hottest in the game, how I feel
You ain't fuckin' with my team's how I feel
You tell your bitch I call her when I feel
Kill you fuck niggas every time I feel like it
Living for the knife
And I don't give a fuck if it's only for the night, dog
Feelin' it
About the time to go in
Nigga this that dope boy eh
Dog, feeling it
About the time to go in

[Outro]
Montana!
Montana!
