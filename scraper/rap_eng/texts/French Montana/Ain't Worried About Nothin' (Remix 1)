[Intro: French Montana]
Ain't worried 'bout nothin'
Nigga, I ain't worried 'bout nothin'
Nigga, I ain't worried 'bout nothin'
Nigga, I ain't worried 'bout nothin'

[Intro: Miley Cyrus]
Ain't worried 'bout nothin'
Bitch, I ain't worried 'bout nothin'
I ain't really worried 'bout nothin'
Bitch, I ain't worried 'bout nothin'

[Verse 1: Miley Cyrus]
Broke a record on the day I dropped my video
I got three thick girls in my video
Pop a molly and you know you know you'll never stop
You think I'm turnt up wait until my album drops
Versace, versace versace I wear that vintage versace
Fashion week you can find me in New York posing for the paparazzi
And I'm all white like french montana
Oh shit there goes hannah montana
Acting like a little southern girl
Now twerking like I grew up in Atlanta


[Hook]
Nigga, I ain't worried 'bout nothin'
Nigga, I ain't worried 'bout nothin'
Nigga, I ain't worried 'bout nothin'
I ain't worried 'bout nothin'
Nigga, I ain't worried 'bout nothin'
Nigga, I ain't worried 'bout nothin'
Nigga, I ain't worried 'bout nothin'
Ridin' round with that work, strapped up with that Nina (got to)
Bad bitches with me, molly and Aquafina
Money don't mean nothing, niggas don't feel you when they see you
My whole 'hood love me, but naan nigga wanna touch me
Nigga, I ain't worried 'bout nothin'
Nigga, I ain't worried 'bout nothin'
Nigga, I ain't worried 'bout nothin'
I ain't worried 'bout nothin'
Nigga, I ain't worried 'bout nothin'
Nigga, I ain't worried 'bout nothin'
Nigga, I ain't worried 'bout nothin'

[Verse 1]
Nigga, I ain't worried 'bout nothin'
Ridin' 'round through East Tremont
Nigga, I ain't worried 'bout nothin'
Ridin' 'round with that Nina
Ridin' 'round with that AK, that HK, that SK
That beam on the scope
Window down, blowin' smoke
Niggas frontin be broke
Try rob me, gon' get smoked
That gun automatic, my car automatic
Ain't worried 'bout nothin'

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Money don't mean nothin' (nada), bitches don't mean nothin' (nada)
Come here with your hand out, nigga I don't owe you nothin' (nana)
I'm ridin' round with that work, Max lost trial I'm hurt
I'll ride through Mott Haven, I'll ride through Castle Hill
You know that Coupe half a million, fuck how niggas feel
Cause I ain't really worried 'bout nothin', my niggas ain't worried 'bout nothin'
Ain't worried 'bout nothin'

[Hook]
