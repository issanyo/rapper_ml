[Intro: Celia Cruz]
Mi Oshun, caridad del cobre
Yemayá, mi guía espiritual
Virgencita, yo que soy tan pobre
Sólo clamo por la tranquilidad

[Verse 1: Bodega Bamz]
Yeah, my skin tan and my fade low
(But hold up, hold up, hold up) you know that
Picture me with a little homie, send a Kodak
I be up North where they snow that
Ass so fat, girl, you know you gotta show that
Paid for school but she always tryna blow that
Beefing with me, six feet, get your toe tag
Ghostwrite hits, you don't even know I wrote that (Papi)
Young Don Juan, got the streets in a choke
From a car to a boat, run sand to the beach
In a [?], Papi make it look easy
(Tanboys) This industry need me
Came on the scene with a razor in my mouth
Gave it to my mom to cut the bow on her house
Spanish Harlem, I'm your child
New York, New York, play this motherfucker loud

[Hook: Bodega Bamz]
With the hoes like Don Francisco

[Verse 2: French Montana]
I came up scrapping that pot
Garage like a showroom, look at that lot
Talking 'bout "bonjour," well nigga, voilà
Ball like Carmelo smoking la la
Shout out to my old yay
Sin [?], 145 on Broadway
We don't got weight money
We don't gotta make it, we take money
Me and Chinx gon' pull up in a big white yacht, la marina
We was dropping off work at Medina
Go and tell Flex to drop a bomb on it
Watch flooded, can't tell the time on it
Tell your bitch, "Come climb on it"
It ain't hot unless I'm on it
Coke Boys, every day is a payday
From the [?] with the AK

[Hook: Bodega Bamz]
With the hoes like Don Francisco

[Outro: A$AP Ferg & Bodega Bamz]
Them Tanboys my niggas
With the hoes like Don Francisco
Them Tanboys my niggas
Don Francisco
