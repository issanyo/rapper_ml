[Hook:]
Everybody know me everywhere I go
(Everybody know me everywhere I go)
I'm strapped for sure everybody knows
(I'm strapped for sure everybody knows) (4X)

[Verse:]
Baby let Montana help you hit the top
I'll get the four door you'll get the drop
She chase her liquor down I take a shot
Let me brake it down let me get you right
Short over there keep on watching me
So you shorty what you like is it my watch or me?
I'm in the zone and ain't any nigga stopping me (2X)
I gotta to play it smooth and make them wait
I gotta play it cool let them marinate
I gotta stay strapped can't stop the hate
No matter where I'm at anytime of day

[Hook]
