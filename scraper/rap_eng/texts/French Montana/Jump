[Intro: French Montana & Travis Scott]
Ayy, Trav
This one for the wave culture (woo!)
So prolific, yeah
If they talking 'bout ballin'
We jumping out the gym, baby!
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
Yeah
Skkrt, skkrt, skkrt

[Chorus: Travis Scott & French Montana]
I jump out bae, (straight up), yeah
I jump out bae
I jump out bae, yeah
I drop my top when we outside (skrrt)
Once I go live, we all go live
Jump, jump, jump out bae (straight up) (haaan)
I jump out bae, I jump out bae (yeah, yeah, yeah)
I drop my top, I go outside
Once I'm live we all go live (it's lit)
Jump, jump, jump, out bae

[Verse 1: French Montana]
Foreign cars ain't rented
Drop tops, jump in it
Hit it, top down, gang with me
Throwing up five cities
Trapping through the boost phone, buying those minutes
Me and Trav in that four, running through limits
Fucking with your boy, man sky ain't the limit
Now Sky-Dweller OG five with the chemist, ah
I've been tweakin' off the pills with a stick and some 'Yac when I ride through that motherfucker (swoop)
Lost some good niggas slipping to these hatin' ass niggas
So I ain't playin' I just (gunshot), graah
Pull up to the rock
Got the Philippine look up in my eyes way up
Hot, got ice on my hand
Me and Trav jump out, we ain't gonna drop the top off, damn
Yeah!

[Chorus: Travis Scott & French Montana]
I jump out bae
I jump out bae, yeah
I drop my top when we outside (drop top)
Once I go live, we all go live
Jump, jump, jump out bae (straight up) (haaan)
I jump out bae, I jump out bae (yeah, yeah, yeah)
I drop my top, I go outside (straight up)
Once I'm live we all go live (it's lit)
Jump, jump, jump out bae

[Verse 2: Travis Scott]
I'd rather go fight off the devil
Spend another night in this hell
Ass and titties by the several
Bout to take it up another level
Bout to jump out on the tropics
Whip my dick out, everybody watching
Running and they ain't 'gon stop me
Only way I solve all my problems
'Bout to go drive my Diablo
Grab the steering wheel with my eyes closed
All up in yo phone, fucking on my model
On the narcos, feel like Pablo
Got my first chain, was rose golden
White bitches on me like I'm Kobe
Turn my jeweler to my trainer
Tell em "ice me," 'cause I'm swollen

[Chorus: Travis Scott & French Montana]
I jump out bae (yeah)
I jump out bae
I jump out bae (skrrt), yeah
I drop my top when we outside (drop top)
Once I go live, we all go live
Jump, jump, jump out bae (straight up) (haaan)
I jump out bae, I jump out bae (yeah, yeah, yeah)
I drop my top, I go outside
Once I'm live we all go live (it's lit)
Jump, jump, jump out bae
