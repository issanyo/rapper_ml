[Hook]
I'd rather be with you, you, you, you, you
I'd rather be with you, you, la, la-da-da
I've been gettin' money, don't play yaself (oh)
Hear you sneak talk, don't play yaself (haah)
You know about me, don't play yaself (oh)
Bein' doin' this here, don't play yaself (haah)
She know bout me, don't play yaself (oh)
I know about her, don't play yaself (haah)
Been stuntin', don't play yaself (oh)
You niggas frontin', don't play yaself (haah)

[Verse 1]
Thinkin' I'ma fall off, what you smokin'?
Crib with the tennis court, got French open
Can't stop us, top dollars, paparazzi
Liberace, money be the topic
Rappers smoke and mirrors, paper kinda light
I had Jhene Aiko, china white
Tommy Buns table with the young shooters
100 chains on, 51 Cuban
Word to Larry King but King David
This young king been gettin' paper
30,000 feet, jet no turnin' back
Number 30 fill the crocodile Burkin bag

[Hook]
I'd rather be with you, you, you, you, you
I'd rather be with you, you, la, la-da-da
I've been gettin' money, don't play yaself (oh)
Hear you sneak talk, don't play yaself (haah)
You know about me, don't play yaself (oh)
Bein' doin' this here, don't play yaself (haah)
She know bout me, don't play yaself (oh)
I know about her, don't play yaself (haah)
Been stuntin', don't play yaself (oh)
You niggas frontin', don't play yaself (haah)

[Verse 2]
Aye, four door lookin' like four banks
You niggas ain't sure and you sure ain't
Who I bring the sun down, bring the sun up with
Marathon money, fuck you, who you runnin' with
Smokin' hydrophonics and Bora Bora
Young akh' smoke chronic readin' a Surah
You know they watchin' your pockets if money be the topic
Nigga stop it, you ain't build enough to stop 'em
Even though I spend to cop it I don't call her mine
I don't call her blind, it ain't about the money it's that storyline
Cause the same homies that gave you life
Friends turn to competition, they don't like it
Tell 'em crabs I'm eatin' lobster
Niggas askin' me to Oscars
From the bottom with the same posse
Dappered down, I just want the paper
Biz Markie, shawty want the vapor

[Hook]
I'd rather be with you, you, you, you, you
I'd rather be with you, you, la, la-da-da
I've been gettin' money, don't play yaself (oh)
Hear you sneak talk, don't play yaself (haah)
You know about me, don't play yaself (oh)
Bein' doin' this here, don't play yaself (haah)
She know bout me, don't play yaself (oh)
I know about her, don't play yaself (haah)
Been stuntin', don't play yaself (oh)
You niggas frontin', don't play yaself (haah)

[Outro]
Don't play yaself
Do your motherfuckin' homework
If you still in school dumb motherfucker
One thing for sure
And a million things for certain
We gon' ball forever nigga
Just (?)

Montana
Mac And Cheese, Fraud
