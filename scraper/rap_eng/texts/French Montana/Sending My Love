I put the skull in your bracelet, your ex taste this
Wine cellars in the basement, the crib spaceless
I chuck a deuce in my own thing
New beginning me and mama gotta trust it
White linnen top back on that Mustang
This is way more than a lust act
You sealed it up and you slip it out
That's a touch that I promise I will end it up
If I could let my heart right to you I would
I’d pack it up, seal it tight
And I'd send it over now
I am sending my love to you
Praying that you are home
Sealing it with a kiss
Sending my love
What, bottom on your Louie Vuitton’s, color Shirley Temple
Spray with a greener theme for your love is simple
Big spress way out
Any child is comfort, not worry about the mileage
Private jet, Bogota then Tahiti service
Standing on the flight, I’ll be there when you need me
Record the sing, ringin’ your name
Provide for my lady
Kill me if I’m never able
67 all that back, panoramic ceiling, the definition of mach
But wussup with you?
Nose straight cuz you always bring your love wit you
Hit me on the Skype, through the night, Imma come get you
If I could let my heart right to you I would
I’d pack it up, seal it tight
And I'd send it over now
I am sending my love to you (baby I am waiting)
Praying that you are home ( so you can come talk to me)
Sealing it with a kiss
Sending my love
Sending my love to you
Sending my love
Praying that you are home
Sealing it with a kiss
Sending my love
She got my under ride it
And there’s something about ‘er
I can even lie, Shorty right there’s a rider
She got my under ride it
And there’s something about ‘er
I can even lie, Shorty right there’s a rider
She got my under ride it
And there’s something about ‘er
I can even lie, Shorty right there’s a rider
Hey lady I need to ax where you been all my life?
You lookin’ right in them jeans tonight and I was wondering
If we could go somewhere, sit on a jet
Supposed to react but we ain’t gotta do that
You tell me you got a man
And it would be nice if respect it, I try my best
But I couldn’t accept becuz she wasn’t convinced
And I could tell I’m the nigga she misses
Sorta called me about a man I just been no more tension
I told her love the way you smell, the way you talk
I hate to see you leave but love the way you walk
She said you don’t give up as easy as I thought
And I told her that me and you could be the top of New York
She said pull out your phone, take down my number
You conversation got me startin’ to wonder but maybe we could be friends
I told her baby ain’t no need to pretend
You’re dealing with a coke boy, you’re guaranteed to win
But Shorty I don’t really know ‘bout the other niggas
One of the niggas that you be dealing with
But if you really down to fuck with a little nigga
All you gotta do Shorty is give me a chance
You know your men all ride like this
Hear me in the club popping bottles like this
Come a little closer, let me whisper in your ear
Show me what the feel is
Shorty give me a chance
She ain’t never been a stranger that’s why I said
Lubretton, Gucci, Louie or a pair of Chanel’s
My baby shoe gain meaning, man can’t you tell?
Have these other bitches trippin’ we should make it ten to sell
She keep a couple bands inside of a Queen bag
If she was a teacher, then the class would be about class
I hear her now state turn and I waltz meaning
And I refuse to say some things that I don’t mean
I make her see and never spike her in a dance song
Snappin’ your fingers, I love you, girl what’s your favorite song?
She got know no wife beat it
Damn, true religion and I love the way her ass look in ‘em
But Shorty I don’t really know ‘bout the other niggas
One of the niggas that you be dealing with
But if you really down to fuck with a little nigga
All you gotta do Shorty is give me a chance
You know your men all ride like this
Hear me in the club popping bottles like this
Come a little closer, let me whisper in your ear
Show me what the feel is
Shorty give me a chance
