[Intro]
Goddamn where the shones at?
Goddamn where the shones at?

[Hook: French Montana & (Wale)]
Came with my niggas but I'm leaving with my bitches
Came with my niggas but I'm leaving with my bitches
Came with my niggas but I'm leaving with my bitches
Came with my niggas but I'm leaving with my bitches
(Beat it up beat it up) yea thrilla in Manila
(Beat it up beat it up) yea thrilla in Manila
(Beat it up beat it up) yea thrilla in Manila
(Beat it up beat it up) yea thrilla in Manila

[Verse 1: French Montana]
Hit em with the bat, pull up like a Mac
Met her at the front but I hit it from the back
Off top, Porsche with off top
Shine like a bald spot, garage like car lot
Came from the hard knoxs, Sean Carter on them bitches
Ballin like nino in the carter on them bitches
Rolling up a smoke then I pour a lil liquor
Then I kidnap ya bitch, you be callin she dont pick up
Fuckin up her make-up, molly and a drinker
Talk 100 chain bitch had to link up
I ain't fuckin undercovers but I'm fuckin up her walls
My arm all covered talkin John Wall
I'm a beast in the east, 100 chains on
Roll with them pushas and I ain't Big Sean (boi!)
Brown bag spender I had ya main bitch trendin
Then pass to my dawg I dont catch feelins

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Tyga]
T-Killa, 8 figure nigga
Skinny tires on the drop but my bitch ass bigga
I'm a home field hitta, you a play the bench nigga
Got a bitch french vanilla, said my nigga french iller
One man thrilla, the diabolical dealer
I eat hoes for dinner, T-Raww carving they Denim
Nigga all in they feelings, I call em bitches they women
I'm throwin money to Christ I know this can't be sinnin, one minute
I bought it before they can rent it
These pills hard as adrenaline, fuck it son continuous
Can't be actin timid, the cars a quarter million
I'm far from being far close to broke niggas
No witness, you need a motherfucker two seater
Gettin money outta state so long need a visa
Shout out my nigga Mally Mall house with the cheetah
She gon suck dick and then she gon eat it cuz I

[Hook]
