[Intro: Ty Dolla $ign]
(Dolla, Dolla $ign)
Mustard on the beat, ho

[Verse 1: Ty Dolla $ign]
When this song come on do the ratchet
No cuffin’ here puff puff pass it
Ay, you know I’m from L.A
Stay ready we ain’t gotta get ready no
Uh, pretty face and a big butt
Told her toot it then I boot it like the World Cup
She make it Wa, Waka-Wa-Waka
She let me hit it like pah-pah

[Pre-Hook: Ty Dolla $ign]
Only is you got me feeling like this
Oh why, why, why, why, why?
Loving while grabbing the rhythm of your hips
That’s right, right, right, right, right

[Hook: Jeremih]
Rhythm is a dancer, I need a companion
Girl I guess that must be you
Body like the summer, fuck you like no other
Don’t you tell ‘em what we do
Don’t tell ‘em, don’t tell ‘em, you ain’t even
Don’t tell ‘em, don’t tell ‘em
You ain’t even, you ain’t even gotta tell ‘em
Don’t tell ‘em, don’t tell ‘em
You ain’t even, don’t tell ‘em, don’t tell ‘em
You ain’t even, you ain’t even even gotta tell ‘em
Don’t tell ‘em, don’t tell ‘em

[Verse 2: Jeremih]
Know you say you down with it
Won’t tell ‘em how you hit the ground with it
Girl you know I’m from Chicago
I act a fool, Bobby Brown with it (in it)
Nobody take me out though
You got gifts bring ‘em down the South Pole
Marathon doll, I’m putting miles
Don’t you worry about it, I can work it out

[Pre-Hook: Jeremih]
Only is you got me feeling like this
Oh why, why, why, why, why?
Loving while grabbing the rhythm of your hips
That’s right, right, right, right, right

[Hook: Jeremih]
Rhythm is a dancer, I need a companion
Girl I guess that must be you
Body like the summer, fuck you like no other
Don’t you tell ‘em what we do
Don’t tell ‘em, don’t tell ‘em, you ain’t even
Don’t tell ‘em, don’t tell ‘em
You ain’t even, you ain’t even gotta tell ‘em
Don’t tell ‘em, don’t tell ‘em
You ain’t even, don’t tell ‘em, don’t tell ‘em
You ain’t even, you ain’t even even gotta tell ‘em
Don’t tell ‘em, don’t tell ‘em

[Verse 3: French Montana]
Shawty from the back, met her in the A
Hit it at the ‘tel, never hit it where I stay, hah
You know I act the fool, Bobby Brown with it
Got her leg shaking, James Brown with it
Drop it to the ground with it
Heard the whole town hit it
Hit it then I pass it to my man, D. Brown with it
Young rich niggas, uptown
Keep her close, we snipe, duck down
And you already know
Pull up in the big ass yacht like no
Don’t tell ‘em, don’t tell ‘em
You ain’t even gotta tell ‘em
We ain’t kissin’, we ain’t tellin’
Money stack to the ceiling, hah
(Montana!)

You ain’t even, don’t tell ‘em, don’t tell ‘em
You ain’t even, you ain’t even even gotta tell ‘em
Don’t tell ‘em, don’t tell ‘em

[Verse 2: Quavo]
Don't tell 'em that I beat it up like fight night
But she did tell me that you're small like a Mike & Ike
Too much information, baby, you ain't gotta tell me
But everybody know that she selfish
Pull up in Ferraris, my bitch rockin' Versace
They already know we fuckin', you ain't gotta hide it
Nobody can find us, we coolin' on islands
You ain't gotta tell him that I got you outta Follies
When I pulled up on her, you know she get in
She ain't know that I'm handsome and wealthy
House on a hill, got a mansion, come live
Just don't tell nobody how you got in

[Verse 3: Takeoff]
Beat it up, don't eat it up, Bentley Mulsanne I speed it up
Want you to travel around the globe with me, no Expedia
Rockin' a mink chinchilla, fox fur, put in my interior
Smokin' hookah with Everclear, takin' a trip to Delaware
Maison Margiela, I shop any weather
My girl wanna be a Giuseppe stepper
Peter Piper, he done piped the pepper
I'm Michael Phelps, won a gold medal
Hit it with the left then hit it with the right
Knockout just call me Mayweather
So many Benjamins on me
Might mistake me for a bank teller

[Hook: Jeremih]
Rhythm is a dancer, I need a companion
Girl I guess that must be you
Body like the summer, fuck you like no other
Don’t you tell ‘em what we do
Don’t tell ‘em, don’t tell ‘em, you ain’t even
Don’t tell ‘em, don’t tell ‘em
You ain’t even, you ain’t even gotta tell ‘em
Don’t tell ‘em, don’t tell ‘em
You ain’t even, don’t tell ‘em, don’t tell ‘em
You ain’t even, you ain’t even even gotta tell ‘em
Don’t tell ‘em, don’t tell ‘em

[Verse 4: Offset]
I'm dabbin' in Maison Margielas, don't tell 'em they might get jealous
Her forehead on my pelvis, I don't cuff 'em, I don't settle
You a champion, you deserve a gold medal
Ain't got time on my schedule, gotta go get the cheddar
You ain't got time to be worried 'bout them
Kissin' all over you, rubbin' your hip
I got the Tiffany diamonds all up in your ear
Smackin' your booty while I'm hittin' it from the rear
Smackin' a secret, your pussy be drippin' in liquid
I did a show I cannot leave it, fuck her and then I delete it
Victoria, she keepin' a secret, don't tell 'em that, no
My diamonds, they cold, anemic, and I can't front, no
I'm finished, you know I need a

[Hook: Jeremih]
Body like the summer, fuck you like no other
Don’t you tell ‘em what we do
Don’t tell ‘em, don’t tell ‘em, you ain’t even
Don’t tell ‘em, don’t tell ‘em
You ain’t even, you ain’t even gotta tell ‘em
Don’t tell ‘em, don’t tell ‘em
You ain’t even, don’t tell ‘em, don’t tell ‘em
You ain’t even, you ain’t even even gotta tell ‘em
Don’t tell ‘em, don’t tell ‘em

[Verse 3: YG]
9-3-4 8-6-1-6
I gotta missed call from your bitch
She been plottin' on me for a cool minute
She wanna' suck my dick, and I'm cool with it
I like girls in the shower, when it's winter fresh
It’s some Twitter pussy, I met on the Internet
On my late-night thirsty, ‘cause it was late-night and I was thirsty
Girl, I been to that county girl, I ain't tellin'
Handcuff me to the bed, girl it ain't no bailin'
I keep a stack of hundreds, I can keep a secret
If anything you was explorin', you wasn’t cheating
She got my number stored under fake names
Her nigga think she faithful, but she runnin game, YOLO
So take me out these Polos
And we can fuck from Uno to Ocho

[Pre-Hook: Jeremih]
Only is you got me feeling like this
Oh why, why, why, why, why?
Loving while grabbing the rhythm of your hips
That’s right, right, right, right, right

[Hook: Jeremih (YG)]
Rhythm is a dancer, I need a companion
Girl I guess that must be you
Body like the summer, fuckin' like no other
(I keep it on the D.L, and creep like TL
Just tell me them details, just hand me)
Don't you tell 'em what we do
Don't tell 'em, don't tell 'em, you ain't even
Don't tell 'em, don't tell 'em
You ain't even, you ain't even gotta tell 'em
Don't tell 'em, don't tell 'em
You ain't even, don't tell 'em, don't tell 'em
You ain't even, you ain't even even gotta tell 'em
Don't tell 'em, don't tell 'em (no)

[Outro: Jeremih]
Right, right, right, right, right, right, right
Don't tell 'em, don't tell 'em, no
Why, why, why, why would you do (oh)
Just keep the rhythm like that, that (that, that)
Put in on like that, that (that, that)
I know you like that (that, that, that, that)
You know I want that (that, that, that, that)
Ohh oh-ohh oh-ohh oh-ohh
