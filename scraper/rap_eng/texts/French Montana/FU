[Intro: Miley Cyrus]
Oh, you broke my heart
I told you I was weak for love
But then you went around
And did what you wanted to do
And now I'm cryin', cryin'

[Verse 1: Miley Cyrus]
Ooh, it seemed like everything was going fine
I found the love that I thought was gonna last
But then I accidentally saw a few things in your cell
I even LOL'd
Man, I should've known
Why? Why you're doing what you do?
You, you might as well just tell the honest truth
See, I'm not really down with this
This ain't no texting shit
No, I ain't got no biz, but it is what it is

[Pre-Chorus: Miley Cyrus]
I don't really have much to say
I was over it the second that I saw her name

[Chorus: Miley Cyrus]
I got two, ooh-ooh, letters for you
One of them's "F" and the other one's "U"
'Cause what you gotta do is go get yourself a clue
Only two, ooh-ooh, letters to choose
One of them's "F" and the other one's "U"
SMH
I'm pressing "send" on you

[Verse 2: French Montana]
Could've been this, could've been that
We done been there, we done been back
You ain't with it, could've said that
Why you tripping?
Let me hit that
I ain't trying to argue no more
I do it all for you
You know you're my ride or die, baby, let me show you

[Verse 3: Miley Cyrus]
Oh, I know what's been going on
Don't even try to act like Mr. Super Nonchalant
What makes you think I'll stick around?
I'm not as stupid as you sound
And you sound really dumb right now
From A to Zed, ooh-ah
I got a lot of nasty things floating up in my head
But none of them are worth my time
You're not even worth this rhyme
And I don't, I don't give a flying

[Pre-Chorus: Miley Cyrus]
I don't really have much to say
I was over it the second that I saw her name

[Chorus: Miley Cyrus]
I got two, ooh-ooh, letters for you
One of them's "F" and the other one's "U"
'Cause what you gotta do is go get yourself a clue
Only two, ooh-ooh, letters to choose
One of them's "F" and the other one's "U"
SMH
I'm pressing "send" on you

[Bridge: French Montana & (Miley Cyrus)]
(Ooh-ooh, two letters for you, yeah) Letters for you
What you trippin' on?
Girl, you know you wrong
Don't let these girls drive you crazy, haan

[Pre-Chorus: Miley Cyrus]
I don't really have much to say
I was over it the second that I saw her name

[Chorus: Miley Cyrus]
I got two, ooh-ooh, letters for you
One of them's "F" and the other one's "U"
'Cause what you gotta do is go get yourself a clue
Only two, ooh-ooh, letters to choose
One of them's "F" and the other one's "U"
SMH
I'm pressing "send" on you
