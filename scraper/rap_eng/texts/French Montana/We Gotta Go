She said baby im the one, the one, theres nobody to run from
Baby im the one, the one, theres nobody to run from
We gotta go
We gotta go

Like a lamborgini, shorty ride up on me
I hear them niggas talk, they ain't got nothin for me
Them boys comin for me, runnin outta time
Wanna get my attention? throw up a dollar sign

We gotta go
She said baby im the one, the one, theres nobody to run from
We gotta go
She said baby im the one, the one, theres nobody to run from

I be dippin through, lookin for a bitch or two
Try to get a breather when this shit get critical
Get you through a long day, whole sale missin you
All the player haters, they dont know who to listen to
Personal, baby im tuckin you, rover, lamb with the stripe, zoom in and get a close up
Sweet, you a freak, dont be playin with your beef
I hustle like lebron, that took off from the keef
From the feet up, we tough, delinja, two shots
Pump go blast, take a chunk out your ass
Like lights camera action, know we runnin town
Work I break it down like fractions
And I only nigga gettin money in the drought
And them hoes bring em in, kick em out
Did about 20 pumps then fell off, rude bwoy hittin up my phone keep screamin out french you still off?

We gotta go, we gotta go, we gotta go
We gotta go, we gotta go, we gotta go
We gotta go, she said baby im the one, the one, theres nobody to run from
We gotta go, she said baby im the one, the one, theres nobody to run from

Money over bitches, everythings a go
Rollin through the district, playin in the snow
Whippin like its bisquick, everybody know
Keep it at a distance, dont play with my dough
Now give it to the dj, put it on the replay
Your ho-style bafoonery, you bought it off of ebay
Got it on the rover, now she on the sofa
I drink so much I be high when im sober
Roll up, hola at your lady, baby, she lookin at my like im crazy
Wavey, says shes a diva, rollin in the beamer
Shorty half white and fillipino
Bitch was breakin out, wanted me to break it down
Hell naw
You can stay with famron, im gone
She said, baby im the one, the one, theres nothin you should run from
Nothin you should run from

Like a lamborgini, shorty ride up on me
I hear them niggas talk, they ain't got nothin for me
Them boys comin for me, runnin outta time
Wanna get my attention? throw up a dollar sign

We gotta go
She said baby im the one, the one, theres nobody to run from
We gotta go
She said baby im the one, the one, theres nobody to run from
