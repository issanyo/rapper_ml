[Verse 1: Lil Durk]
L's up for them hitta niggas
Got hitta niggas that a hit a nigga
Check a bag with ten niggas
We still hit cause we still them niggas
Under pressure from the media
Not knowing that we still some killers
Throwin' L's, can't take a L cause alot of L's be swisher nigga
Kay Kay still bussin', Tee Tee still bussin'
Got a deal and my niggas here but I still can'tï»¿ trust'em
Me ain't no duckin'
These niggas ain't on nothing
See alot of these niggas threats but I ain't worried about nothing
L's

[Verse 2: French Montana]
I woke up in some new punani
Got that Cyrus and that Gwen Stefani
Put God first then we get that money
Broke my rear view, fuck who's behind me
They ain't pray to God they to pray to Gotti
Where I'm from you catch a lick or catch a body
That's a 360 Rari Spider
That white bitch brought me back like Tiger

[Verse 3: Lil Durk]
I'm higher than an astronaut, I'm off the shit I'm passin' out
I don't know what they tellin' 'bout, wearing wires a get 'em got
Where I'm from my niggas win, couple niggas that's gone for ten
Couple guys that's R.I.P., niggas know that we get it in
Life ain't no joke, nigga L's up for lil Mo, nigga
Life ain't no joke, nigga L's up for lil Mo, nigga
