Designer sayin' supplies gettin' low

Potty mouth, rockstar, at the top and still tryna climb
Drop the top sit back recline
Hundred-K that's just the ride

Pick up the pace, turn up the bass

Hit your J or split your blunt, DPG then we turned up
Blue bandana, French Montana
All around the world first class
VIP, bubble bath
Touchdown (touchdown)
Two points
Wide receiver Khalifa bless me with two joints
They told big Dogg, he gotta get up on this hit dog
Turn it up let me hear the beat for a second
Have a few puffs then I breathe on the record
Then we go like merri-go, round and round
This right here is for the underground
I wonder how, I break it down for you
It's you, it's you it's all for you
Everything I do, I tell you all the time
Heaven is a place on earth with you
Tell me all the things you wanna do
I heard that you like the bad girls, honey is that true?
