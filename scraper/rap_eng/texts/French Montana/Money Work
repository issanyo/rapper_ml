Girl I let my money work, work let my money work x8

[Verse 1 - Uncle Murda:]
Bitch I let my money work in California
Bitch I'm with the mexicans, in Arizona
Bitch I'm talking pure white for every thousand grands
Bitch I'm talking white girls on the Peter Pan
Bitch I'm sitting at the light in some big shit
Talking big shit, listening to big shit
Quarter mill for my big chains, hey papi I need a hundred things
A hundred homie? Nigga you heard me a hundred things
Bitch I let my money work, I'm blowing thousands
Bitch I got my whole crew out of public housing
Town over tell me to tell Ross I got that
The police, the F boys, the DEA can't stop that
That nina, that.40, that AK I pop that
That Louis, that Gucci that flossy I rock that
That new girl with epic insomnia I got that
I got that, nigga you heard me I got that

[Verse 2 - French Montana:]
I'm putting overtime bitch I let my money work
You know I overgrind bitch now I'm 20 worth (milli)
Still riding dirty hanging on the stake
Talking 40 shard kit for the break
Me and Murda on the back block swerving
Higher than a motherfucker feel turbulence
I let my money twerk, twerk let the bitches smurk, smurk
Let the dogs go, let them drivers skurve
I know some average sis, I know some porn stars
I own some bentley sis, I got some sports car
Underground we spend that, little bars I in that
Hottest niggas we been that, fast cars we in that
Correct to try to save me, won't see me on a warning poster
Stand up with the work, count on money all in one motion
I'm talking same damn time
Knowing I'm a make 'em when I was way back griding, coke boy
