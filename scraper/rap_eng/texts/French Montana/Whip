[Intro: French Montana &  Soulja Boy]
(French) Bounce, Bounce (Coke Boy, SOD)
Bounce, Bounce
Bounce, Bounce

[Hook: French Montana]
Whip, whip, whip, whip, whippin' up a lick
Whip, whip, whip, whip, whippin' up a lick
Whip, whip, whip, whip, whippin' up a lick
Whip, whip, whip, whip, whippin' up a lick

[Bridge: French Montana]
Whipping up quater key yola, watch me lean it with it
Right right, left left, right right, left left
Whip, whip, whip, whip, whippin' up a lick

[Verse 1: French Montana]
Whipping up a Phantom, whipping up a chain
Whipping up a house, whipping up a plane
Gotta hit that corner store
Been hit that corner slow
Sneaker box full of money, garage like a auto show
Oh for show
Big bank take lil bank
Big truck, big length
Big bucks, Ben Frank
Benz 500, G box photo G
I zip a nigga up like my Pollo tee
Rich chain, whip gang
Fift cock, Benz drop
Two door, too slow
Bank stop, Hitchcock
Fresh up out the corner, bitch I got a honor roll
Now get the baking soda, than you gotta go

[Hook + Bridge: French Montana]

[Verse 2: 2 Chainz]
Baby face yeah I got that whip appeal
Louis on my feet the same color a Snicker's is
I'm running shit, I need a sneaker deal
Hair Weave Killer, tell you girl i'll flip her weave
Just bought a new crib it got crazy space
Iâ€™m on Delta you in a Delta 88
I get to the money, I don't hesitate
All these damn cellphones, I can catch a sale case
This car that I got, I work hard for
Nah f-Nah forreal, I work hard for
When a drought hit man I hit the mall
Duffle Bag Boys, our logo should be Santa Claus
All these fucking paper like a catalouge
Baking soda hit that water I make it cannon bomb
Whip, whip, whip, whip like a caveman
Got a pocket full of hundreds, I ain't changing

[Hook + Bridge: French Montana]

[Verse 3: Soulja Boy]
Five cell phones on me like a dope boy
Sold out shows across the globe with the Coke Boys
Niggas mad at me cause I never move sloppy
Catch me in the kitchen whipping up a Bugatti
I see you dudes copy, infinite money like it's the illuminati
Soulja Boy, French Montana, all up in Atlanta
Niggas talking they can't stand us
I be swag surfin' on channels
AK with a black bandana
Niggas hating on me but they gotta face it
150 thousand dollars in my fucking bracelet
Lamborghini fast, kid got damn i'm awesome
Lil Dre came out the water like a dolphin
Whipping up a paper plate with a new cake
30 on my wrist, shouts out to the Jacob
Franck Muller all the other whatever you want
I got it bitch you name it, Soulja Boy, i'm fucking on

[Hook + Bridge: French Montana]
