(Intro)
Damn it feel good to see people up on it
Can ya say New York City?

(Hook)
Damn it feel good to see people up on it x6

(Verse 1: French Montana)
Damn it feel good to see people up on it
Keep your fake jewels my n****'s camp on it
Crib 8 rooms duck and stay true
Boat f*** that helicopters land on it
Catch your b**** slippin' i'ma break dance on her
Then cut the b**** off I'ma K Camp on her
Yeah a n**** ballin' it's funny how the ball bounce
Creepin' on a quarter billy from a quarter ounce
Right here on my neck is your label n****
Staples said it how you feel stables n****
I love to see a real n****'s win
Had the neck 2 milly just to make one in
N**** you do the math
I just blew a half
On a wraith with the stars
Blowin' through the ave
3 bricks on my wrist n****
On my mommy yous a b**** n****

(Hook)
Damn it feel good to see people up on it x6

(Verse 2: Pryme)
Ok check the prime highlights
Violence, drugs and money
Fixing cars homie thats my life
Can't believe complaints so far
No cuts on my physical
Whole lot of emotional scars
Yeah i'm frontin' y'all ain't holdin' right
My team come through control the night
Dopeboy leathers I sold the bites
Ski yo stalking me if I ain't drivin' then
Walk with me
I don't play that watch how you talk to me
Rock with the heavy set
All my fronts clear on every tech
If you from the hood we already lit
Top dude Prodo Jay will pop you
Anything you hear 'bout me
If I ain't sayin it it's not true
Unleash the hounds on 'em
Who the hottest
I'm gettin' ground on 'em
I don't chase chickens I pound on 'em
Fast B yeah we on tax free
10 g's a week that's slow money
I'm broke if you ask me

(Hook)
Damn it feel good to see people up on it x6

(Verse 3: Jadakiss)
Damn it feel good to see people up on it
I'm in all black on your block creepin' up on it
Dope so pure I gotta keep a cut on it
We was gettin' money in Charlotte like The Hornets
Then the stash went from brolic to enormous
B****'s just used to acknowledge now they sworn us
Good friend of Christopher Wallace for the longest
Most consistent i'm polished i'm the strongest
I ain't just become that n**** I was born it
Thought we was duckin' the feds but they was on us
Work would've been with the guns we was gourmish
Big shout out to the honeys they adorn us
Those that still gettin' money on the corners
Larges with the garage's full of foreigners
Greater than never equal to my opponent
Feels so damn good to see people is up on it

(Hook)
