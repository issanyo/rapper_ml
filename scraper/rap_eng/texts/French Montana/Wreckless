[Verse 1: French Montana]
It's not unproper for the competition
Riskless, top miss (Bling)
Blast for me like this cash money
And hold me tight like your last hundred
Black shades but the [?] suit
Tell a name [?] double gang bang
Work [?] again (Faded)
We all, out on [?] fucked your PR
No style, assault the choppers
Don't get peed on

[Chorus: Lyrica Anderson]
Don't be reckless
When you're away from me
Save it all for me
Baby don't be reckless
'Less your on top on me (Yeah)
Give it all to me (Yeah)

Baby I'ma give you new love
New love, new love, new love (Yeah)
Baby I'ma give you new love
New love, new love, new love (Yeah)
Baby I'ma give you new love
New love, new love (Yeah)
Baby I'ma give you new love
New love, new love, new love (Yeah)

[Verse 2: Lyrica Anderson]
Lock it up for me twenty part of life
Roll the dice, we don't need to think twice
Somethin' bout you got you always on my mind
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Run it up boy you know the things I like
Give me Gucci, Louis and [?]
I'm really really fucking witchu
I'm only really fucking with you

But don't have to get comfortable baby
If I leave you'll be sad and left for basic
The only real one that's been by your side
When you with you niggas, better things twice

[Chorus]
Don't be reckless (Don't be, don't be)
When you're away from me (Away from me)
Save it all for me (Uh, uh)
Baby don't be reckless (Don't be, don't be)
'Less your on top on me (Yeah)
Give it all to me (Yeah)

Baby I'ma give you new love
New love, new love, new love (Yeah)
Baby I'ma give you new love
New love, new love, new love (Yeah)
Baby I'ma give you new love
New love, new love (Yeah)
Baby I'ma give you new love
New love, new love, new love (Yeah)
