[Verse 1: KG]

You already know like gettin' rejected
Me gettin' signed, that shit was unexpected
My niggas, we were never protected
I'm gettin respected, now your bitch wanna fuck me
Sellin' freebase on the freeway like Ricky
These niggas wanna be boxers, like Game on Ricky
She lick me like a guitar, now I gotta hickey
Got a cuff in the crease, nigga peep the Dickies

[Hook: KG & French Montana]

KG, that nigga all the real niggas know
What I'm up to, you already know

[Verse 2: KG]

I fuck these bad bitches, but I don't fuck around
Turn my shit up, you know what's goin' down
My team in control, on the pole they goin' down
She was a good girl, but she hoin' now
Just like a pillar I hold it down
And take my city higher, comin' outta Miami
Struggle lit the fire, now I'mma carry the torch
I'm on some Triple C's shit, no more sellin' crack on my porch

[Hook: KG & French Montana]

KG, that nigga all the real niggas know
What I'm up to, you already know

[Verse 3: French Montana]

I'm talkin' shit, Excuse My French
All the hoes know me, it's French
They smell in the hood, nigga what's that stench?
I'm ballin' like Kobe, y'all broke boys sittin' on the bench
Tatted my name on it, French Montana
Me and your bitch skinny dipping, Juelz Santana
Oh boy, I'mma Coke Boy
I'll pull the chopper on 'em, I'm no joke boy

[Hook: KG & French Montana]

KG, that nigga all the real niggas know
What I'm up to, you already know
