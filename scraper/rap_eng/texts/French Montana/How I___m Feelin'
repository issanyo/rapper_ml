[Hook: French Montana]
That coupe that cost 100, boy, that's how I'm feeling
Must mean that dirty money, boy, that's how I'm feeling
That's how I'm feeling, roll one, that's how I'm feeling
Throw a mansion on one hand, that's how I'm feeling
That's how I'm feeling, that's how I'm feeling
All my niggas kept 100, now we make a killing
That's how I'm feeling, that's how I'm feeling
All my niggas kept 100, now we make a killing

[Verse 1: Franc Grams]
I'm feeling like a milli
It gotta be the money, I'm feeling like I'm Nelly
To the same nigga, but it seem that they don't feel me
I been killing niggas, now I think they wanna kill me
Yeah, I'm here, yeah please relax
I don't read the chat, don't reach for that
Cause God be hating, don't ask me
To take a pic with y'all for IG and Snap
I don't fuck with y'all, let it be just that
I made it clear, no need to ask
I came with pictures, 3 in fact
And these bottles, at least they stack
That Rollie on me, how appealing
I want your girl, that's how I'm feeling
All it took was a follow back
And a Uber call, now we chilling
I hit tonight, won't fuck again
But how I'm feeling, shit I might
Like picture likes with a chick I like
No Instagram, but I hit it twice

[Hook: French Montana]
That coupe that cost 100, boy, that's how I'm feeling
Must mean that dirty money, boy, that's how I'm feeling
That's how I'm feeling, roll one, that's how I'm feeling
Throw a mansion on one hand, that's how I'm feeling
That's how I'm feeling, that's how I'm feeling
All my niggas kept 100, now we make a killing
That's how I'm feeling, that's how I'm feeling
All my niggas kept 100, now we make a killing

[Verse 2: French Montana]
Ain't no telling what a nigga might do
Pull to God, never look like a nigga like you
Throw it in that woman, never get caught up
My nigga, my nigga, I ride the money always
This game is cool, 30 chains
Wraith roof, bitch, I'm switching lanes
Nigga been balling since I seen money
That cold coming, I done came from
You ain't dummy, they change funny
Drop the launch, yeah I made money
Make 10 mill, next show
Pump the fish tank, yeah you get fish on me

[Hook: French Montana]
That coupe that cost 100, boy, that's how I'm feeling

That's how I'm feeling, that's how I'm feeling
All my niggas kept 100, now we make a killing
That's how I'm feeling, that's how I'm feeling

[Verse 3: Franc Grams]
Oh yeah they talking 'bout me, they looking at me
But these niggas ain't dumb
I got real niggas that fuck with me
And these niggas ain't them
Man these bitches love me, my paper up
My phone rang, I need the cut
That lowkey, but I'm way up
They still hating, never gave a fuck
But they never expected this
I was overlooked on that freshman list
They marked me off, I ain't stress that shit
1 year later, I'm the best in this
My old hoes wanna man and shit
My old homies want friendships
What I did is like ISIS
Got them all scared with that French hit
Montana, just how I'm feeling
They don't put in work, this how I'm feeling
Been round and killing, I lounge and chilling
With the whole team, tryna count a million
I'm self made, I don't owe no paper
I don't got [?], that's broke behaviour
We don't love these hoes, we don't know these haters
Independent nigga but it's oh so major, legends never die nigga

[Hook: French Montana]
That coupe that cost 100, boy, that's how I'm feeling

That's how I'm feeling, roll one, that's how I'm feeling

That's how I'm feeling, that's how I'm feeling
All my niggas kept 100, now we make a killing
That's how I'm feeling, that's how I'm feeling
All my niggas kept 100, now we make a killing
