[Intro]

Montana!
I see you Bigga
Harry Fraud
Dame Grease

[Chorus]

We playing in the wind (we playing in the wind)
All my nigga's fly high
We playing in the wind (we playing in the wind)
We getting sky high
We playing in the wind (we playing in the wind)
We got them screaming "Move it! Move it!"
We playing in the wind (we playing in the wind)

[Verse 1]

Selling coke up in the park, mix the coke up with the dark
Since early had em hook, they was doped up from the start
Nigga 'fore I had a album done did it to the maximum
Push it to the limit, never slipping, not a minute
Gotta get it while they getting good shorty touched my weak spot
Hope my nigga Grease got some rubbers me and Max like brothers
And niggas try to duck us when it's pay day
Play day, 30 bitches in the crib I'm Ray J!
They say money ain't everything you motherfucking right
Its the only thing god trust the holy thing
Jewels like Poland Spring niggas in the hood love me
You know money is my sort of thing it's all the same
Streets and this rap shit nigga's all acting
Game got me trapped in black Benz
Circling the block take the roof right off the top
Coke wave you know we coming for you nigga's spot (Montana)

[Chorus]

We playing in the wind (we playing in the wind)
All my nigga's fly high
We playing in the wind (we playing in the wind)
We getting sky high
We playing in the wind (we playing in the wind)
We got them screaming "Move it! Move it!"
We playing in the wind (we playing in the wind)
