[Chorus: Infared]
Nothin' can stop me, I'm all the way up
All the way up
I'm all the way up
I'm all the way up
Nothin' can stop me, I'm all the way up

[Bridge: French Montana & Infared]
Shorty what you want? Shorty what you need?
My niggas run the game, we ain't ever leavin'
Countin' up this money, we ain't never sleepin'
You got V12, I got 12 Vs
Got bottles, got weed, got molly (I'm all the way up)
Shorty what you want? I got what you need
Shorty what you want? I got what you need
Shorty what you want? I got what you need

[Chorus: Infared]
I'm all the way up
I'm all the way up
I'm all the way up
All the way up
Nothin' can stop me, I'm all the way up

[Drop: Infared]
I'm all the way up
All the way up
All the way up

[Verse 2: Remy Ma]
Just left the big house to a bigger house
Ain't have a girlfriend, but the bitch is out
Chanel croc bag, shit ain't even out
With the gold chains, Himalayan, Birkin cocaine
Lit it up, Pac shit, I hit 'em up
I'm talkin' color money, purple yen and blue dirham
I got brown lira, I ain't talkin' 'bout Ross bitch
I'm that nigga on Viagra dick
That means I'm all the way up
And you can stay up
P.O's say I can't get high
Hopped in the helicopter Uber and said
Go all the way up
Go all the way up

[Chorus: Infared]
I'm all the way up
I'm all the way up

[Drop: Infared]
I'm all the way up
All the way up
All the way up

[Chorus: Infared]
I'm all the way up
I'm all the way up
I'm all the way up
I'm all the way up
Nothin' can stop me, I'm all the way up
I'm all the way up
I'm all the way up
I'm all the way up
I'm all the way up
Nothin' can stop me, I'm all the way up
