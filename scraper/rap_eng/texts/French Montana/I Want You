Black hoodie, black sneaks, black Benz all
Money off, eight thou, put my hands on
Mob ties, had to jump through the barbed wire
Now a nigga sitting courtside
Don’t believe what you read, get you feelings hurt
I’m bumping Pimp C while I'm sipping syrup
Niggers get the point, fuck a foul line
My bitch is a 10 I’m on cloud 9
On that red eye try taste some
Why my eyes red? off that haze and rum
Clean like I’m ‘bout to make shit hot
Get your plane ticket, nigga one way to god

You know I want you
You know I need you
I gots to have you
Let me please you

Let me please you baby
I know you might not give no pussy to Montana
But you know, you know, you might wanna give some pussy to Chinx
Don’t you baby?

Hard shots build a nigga up (a nigga up)
I was broken down (down)
Snatched a wing off the bird then I made supper
95% of niggers suckers
You think it’s all real
They play the small bills
Late night, candle light with that cold steel
Slept through the blizzard, I know how the cold feel
Ride dirty, still rollin’ on four wheels (wussup?)
Kiss the game on the forehead
Lay down to rest, large amounts of stress
Got me on my murder one
Deal’s on the table, still try serving one
Dig me, I’m from the jungle, they don’t go there
Far rock American, you get it for the low there

Hey baby
You know I’m sayin’
And even if you won’t fuck me, Chinx or Montana
Suck on my nigga Flip

I wanna see your dreams come true, you got awake ah
First thing on my mind in the morning is get this cake up (this cake up)
I got a so to the vision when then I pick up
Cuz I’m the nigga, the fiend, she for the wake up
Erotica my vitamin, that’s just me
They speak kindly when they speak ‘bout me
Copy boy after LIP
Catch me with Montana
Or with that boy Chinx D, drugs
Nothing but love when you fuckin’ with us (fuckin’ with us)
I brought myself some sticky and it’s all on us uh
I hate a naggin’, ass nigga wasting my baby momma
So stay the fuck away from realm cuz I ain’t with the drama
You know I keep the lama and that’s word to my momma
Come fuck with the Cokeboy maybe
