This concrete is too cold, to be walking on it
Or else walking on it with no shoes on (no shoes on)
Don't wanna struggle, oh no
Don't want it to become a habit
I've been living in the gutter with no shoes on
Let me get up out of here
Before I hurt somebody
Or I have to hurt somebody
Before I hurt somebody
Or I have to hurt somebody
Before I hurt somebody
Or I have to hurt somebody
My momma need a crib
Son needs some jordans
This some bull shit, cause I can't afford them
Pairs listening
And the band recording
Trying to dodge the pen
Hoping I survive the morning
Shit is getting hot
Man I'm talking scourging
Watching bodies drop
Trying to make a fortune
Dancing with no top
Trying to skip my fork and
Wanna own the block
Then you gotta put your work in
Cause

[Chorus:]
This concrete is too cold, to be walking on it
Or else walking on it with no shoes on (no shoes on)
Don't wanna struggle, oh no
Don't want it to become a habit
I've been living in the gutter with no shoes on
Let me get up out of here
Before I hurt somebody
Or I have to hurt somebody
Before I hurt somebody
Or I have to hurt somebody
Before I hurt somebody
Or I have to hurt somebody
You got the biggest gun
I hope it's for protection
How you never run
You just count your blessings
Beating down the drum
Find me the connection
To get up off the slum
That's my only investment
Throw you to the ground
Book you for possession
Now it's going down
Now i teach them a lesson
Crooked as a clown
Wishing I could arrest him
Guess they run the town
From the streets to the correction
So

[Chorus:]
This concrete is too cold, to be walking on it
Or else walking on it with no shoes on (no shoes on)
Don't wanna struggle, oh no
Don't want it to become a habit
I've been living in the gutter with no shoes on
Let me get up out of here
Before I hurt somebody
Or I have to hurt somebody
Before I hurt somebody
Or I have to hurt somebody
Before I hurt somebody
Or I have to hurt somebody
No way to dice that
Toss it against the wall
The way you like that
That's what you're doing dog
Gambling? what you like? street gambling
Gambling? what you like? street gambling
Gambling? what you like? street gambling

[Chorus:]
This concrete is too cold, to be walking on it
Or else walking on it with no shoes on (no shoes on)
Don't wanna struggle, oh no
Don't want it to become a habit
I've been living in the gutter with no shoes on
Let me get up out of here
Before I hurt somebody
Or I have to hurt somebody
Before I hurt somebody
Or I have to hurt somebody
Before I hurt somebody
Or I have to hurt somebody
