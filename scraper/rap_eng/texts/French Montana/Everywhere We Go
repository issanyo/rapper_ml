[Intro: Wale]
Double M G
Bad Boy
Coke Boys
BOA
It's a lot of letters but fuck 'em
Talk money but I don't like to brag
It's not the type of swag
You keep looking at the tag
Told her to bring them bottles
Maybe another waitress
Maybe I shouldn't holla but these other bitches fakin'
French talk to 'em

[Chorus: French Montana]
I got hoes
I got bad bitches where ever that we go
Like look at these hoes
I got hoes
I got hoes
I got hoes
I got h-o-o-o-es
I got hoes
I got bad bitches where ever that we go
Like look at these hoes
I got hoes
I got hoes
I got hoes
I got h-o-o-o-es

[Verse 1: Wale & French Montana]
Perfect figure
I know you're worth the time
Dress fit like body paint
Well I guess I'll be that turpentine
HD when my P's up
Eight freaks they might sneak up
French came with like eight more
Cause real rappers keep a sixteen tucked
And an O-Z of that potent
Bottles of that potion
Flying spur through oceans
I be pimping like I'm from Oakland
See that pinky ring like eight thousand
That call over that stay high
I fade in I fade out
Pair of hoes trynna make out
Like skrrrrtt
About to break out
These bitches on play time
You the niggas that recruit the bitches
That won't do shit with you but FaceTime
Text messages and DM's
Meanwhile she let me split
Yo chick like an old pitcher
Cause she let the whole damn team hit

[Chorus: French Montana]
I got hoes
I got bad bitches where ever that we go
Like look at these hoes
I got hoes
I got hoes
I got hoes
I got h-o-o-o-es

[Verse 2: French Montana & Wale]
All I got is these pills and this liquor on me
Nigga hot like I got a whole brick up on me
Say what I wanna cause I came up out the corner
They said naw nigga now peep this young fly nigga
Why you eyein' nigga?
Probably just that hard liquor
All these bitches in the room and you busy fuckin' with Twitter
And she scheme for the money, money make her come
And she told me ya little money just ain't enough
She trippin on that Maybach
That Bad Boy that Coke Boy
She hit me with that Loso shit
Throw it in my bag boy
I got hoes different zip codes Luda shit
Me and Wale on some movie shit
Montana

[Chorus: French Montana]
I got hoes
I got bad bitches where ever that we go
Like look at these hoes
I got hoes
I got hoes
I got hoes
I got h-o-o-o-es
