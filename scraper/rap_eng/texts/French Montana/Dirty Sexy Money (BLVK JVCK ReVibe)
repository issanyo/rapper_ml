[Chorus: Charli XCX & (French Montana)]
If you wanna pu-pu-pu-pu-put it on me (all, all I need is you)
You're not gonna ge-ge-ge-ge-get it for free (all, all I need is you)
Come on spend that dirty sexy money on me, on me, on me
(All I want is, all I need is) You got to pull up, pull up, pull up, pull up
If you wanna do-do-do-do-do it freaky (all, all I need is you)
24/7, no-no-no-no-no sleep  (all, all I need is you)
Come on put that dirty sexy money on me, on me, on me (all I, all i want is you)
You got to pull up, pull up, pull up, pull up
Pull up, Pull up

[Verse 1: Charli XCX & (French Montana)]
Put your skin on my skin, on my skin
Love it when we touchin', love it when we fuckin', my love
Make you high in a heartbeat, yeah (all I want is you, all, all I need is you)

[Pre-Chorus: Charli XCX]
Woooh, tell me what you want and I can do it to you
I'm a million dollars, make your wishes come true
Calling out you're, calling out, calling out you're
Never seen a girl like this before

[Chorus: Charli XCX & (French Montana)]
If you wanna pu-pu-pu-pu-put it on me (all, all I need is you)
