[Intro]
Coke Boy Baby

Chinx Whattup, Montana!

[Hook-Chinx Drugz]
Things they just ain't been the same
Things are very different now
Made my way up in the game
My closest friends are distant now

Haaaaaaa

[Verse 1-French Montana]
Dope n' coke, roll n' smoke her
On that sofa, till its over-
Homie can't you see we got that waveeeeeeee
Never sober, till its over
Homie can't you see we got that waveeeeeeee
Got that smoke, got that drank
Go and call the freaks
Since ive' made it homie all I see is paws and teeth
City-boy, tinted-roys, ridin' dirty-dirty
Only niggas with that white, you can call it fergie
Made that money, then I lost it, made it back again
Told my bitch fuck her, call her back again
Got that itch, makin' hits, back to back again
Feeled it longer, she was strongest, what you up again?
Me n' chinx on that 9-5
For that loaf, took the oath n' ima' die by
All-red-mazzerati, tell them niggas catch-up
From the bottom till' I got it, tell them niggas wassup

[Hook-Chinx Drugz]
Things they just ain't been the same
Things are very different now
Made my way up in the game
My closest friends are distant now

Haaaaaaa

[Verse 2-Chinx Drugs]
(uhh)My head high, my cup full and my pockets swole
Wake up in the mornin' spread that butter on my bankroll
Things they lookin good,horses on my hood
Bad bitch on my wood,whole life they misunderstood
But now they feel me
Roll up in that suicide, hop out my jewlery so nuts
Your lady doin donuts on my tip
Yes I be that shit, all about my grip
Made my way up out that strip
Now that show money's for sho' money I grip
Like them vices, good memories are priceless
Just pray I ain't dead n go for I figured would life it(uhh)
Coke Boy, all the drank, poured up
On the pill, so what,riot gang nigga throw it upppp

[Outro -French Montana]
Dope n' coke, roll n' smoke her
On that sofa, till its over-
Homie can't you see we got that waveeeeeeee
Never sober, till its over
Homie can't you see we got that waveeeeeeee
Got that smoke, got that drank
Go and call the freaks
Since ive' made it homie all I see is cars and teeth
