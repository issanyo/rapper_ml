So how's it work, bartender gets a call, you pick up a package at point A, deliver to point B, florist gives you C. I want a lawyer. Good, get one

Yo, sit back, relax, catch a heart-attack. Rollin up a swish with the sour, sip the Cognac. Always where the money at, never where it's funny at. Nigga high, nigga stay fly, homie never wears bum at. Shorty was fuckin with them lames, now she fuckin with a real nigga. Got her goin insane, I know shorty losin it. Flyin down Fifth Ave, top down, coupin it. Coke in that Ciroc nigga, loopin em. Park your Porche in neutral, forget about the past, know you're fuckin with the future. Got my nigga Flip, Blaze on track and you know the Coke Boys put the silly on the map

Yo shorty what the business? Baby, why you be trippin? You be flippin through my phone, askin me a million questions. Shorty why you been stressin me? You be stressin me. Baby, you stressin me. Baby, why you always stressin me?

Yo, you got me to point where nigga don't even want to be bothered and tethered. I'm tired of this game, everything you want to argue. It's obvious you don't know how to keep your nigga. Every time I come home it's, "Who you fuckin with Flipper?" Listen, get on your good foot and kick rocks. Next time you see the kid I'm in that new six drop. So stop, cause I'm tired of all of your pettyness. All respect lost so it's only right to debt it list. It's your loss, I'ma work until the edit Twist. Hooked up with French now everybody wanna sex Flip. Shit, is it because I'm a Coke Boy, a real right take money dope boy? Shit, you can call it what you call it. I was once a good nigga but you had to go and spoil it

Yo shorty what the business? Baby, why you be trippin? You be flippin through my phone, askin me a million questions. Shorty why you been stressin me? You be stressin me. Baby, you stressin me. Baby, why you always stressin me?
