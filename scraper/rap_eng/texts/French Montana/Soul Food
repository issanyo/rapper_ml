[Intro - Al Green]
I'm gonna be good to you
I'm gonna be good to you
I'm gonna be good to you
I'm gonna be good to you
If I gave you my love
I'm telling you what I do
You got to be good to me
I'm gonna be good to you

[Verse 1 - French Montana]
Uh
You know I'm trying to make it from the hundreds
Crumbs getting money how it comes
Smoke a thou tryna suffocate my lungs
Nigga scared to get a gun
Get caught and do the Wayne you know me I do the same
Treat drama how it come, treat bitches how I want
Tell the baddest I'm the coldest
Treat me like I'm Moses, hit the water break it down now they call the op
Know we hurt more when you bleeding on the inside
Never love the money more, never hit your honey raw
Another day, another dead, another day, just another dollar after taxes ashes to ashes
I play by the rules married to the game and if I did it all over wouldn't change a thing

[Bridge - Al Green (Chinx)]
If I gave you my love
I'm telling you what I do
You got to be good to me
(It's only right)
I'm gonna be good to you
(Uh huh uh huh)

[Verse 2 - Chinx]
Bet you mad see the swag and the good Gucci shoe
Louis hood, life like a movie [?] Hood
Hen and Rose fill the glass, toast to douche bags and we
Mush fags, sour and kush bags
Long rides got a nigga aggravated [?]
State to state nigga seeing fans ain't even know we had
Yea cheese, say cheese, camera flash off the ice bright flashing em [?] mama factoring
Bum rush the door, yea we gon' Green Bay Packer em
Never slacking and never napping in an I'm shackled in
Grind African, said it wasn't happening now its happening money stacking fuck rapping
Never stress I'ma invest and progress in the recession these niggas ain't learning till you teach them a lesson
Off the mental no pencil, I'm gonna give these niggas a message
Blow the sour straight to the head that's herbal essence

[Outro - Al Green]
If I gave you my love
I'm telling you what I do
You got to be good to me
I'm gonna be good to you
