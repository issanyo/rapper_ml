[Intro: French Montana]
Montana
Chromeo
You know what it is when you hear that, han

[Verse 1: Dave 1]
A girl like you needs love and affection
A girl like you needs quality time
And a boy like me knows how to take directions
You know I would if you're were to be mine

[Pre-Chorus: Dave 1]
But I can't tell you who to love, love
I can't tell you who to love, love
I can't tell you who to love, love, no
But baby I can't tell you who to love, love
I can't tell you who to love, love
I can't tell you who to love, love, no

[Chorus: Dave 1 & P-Thugg]
But you've been sleepin' on me
Don't sleep, don't sleep on me
Don't sleep on me
(Don't sleep) on me
Yeah, you've been sleepin' on me
Don't sleep, don't sleep on me
Don't sleep, don't sleep on me
Don't sleep, don't sleep on me
Yeah, you've been sleepin' on me

[Verse 2: Dave 1]
A girl like you needs extra attention
A girl like you shouldn't be wastin' her time, no
A boy like me
Well, I'll give you the world if you give me the word
And it's killing me
You don't pay me no mind

[Pre-Chorus: Dave 1]
But I can't tell you who to love, love
I can't tell you who to love, love
I can't tell you who to love, love, no
But baby I can't tell you who to love, love
I can't tell you who to love, love
I can't tell you who to love, love, no

[Chorus: Dave 1 & P-Thugg]
But you've been sleepin' on me
Don't sleep, don't sleep on me
Don't sleep on me
(Don't sleep) on me
Yeah, you've been sleepin' on me
Don't sleep, don't sleep on me
Don't sleep, don't sleep on me
Don't sleep, don't sleep on me
Yeah, you've been sleepin' on me

[Verse 3: Stefflon Don & French Montana]
Nine milli in the car no sensei
You can see me looking buff with mi gente
Bad boys and my dons yeah we toot it up
Lifestyle of a don when we pullin' up
Never see me chillin'
Never see me layin' down
Life hand me lemons, I got lemonade now
Boy I'm getting paid, boy I'm getting paid now
And do you wanna holla cuz they know my name now (Montana)

Go ahead, cop the coupe and chop the head
Can't tell you who to love, hold up, looking like the plug
Love turn to hate, and hate turn to love (Go ahead)
Sleep on me might never wake up
I pull up, she lookin' like Anita Baker
Shorty bad, no make up
Slept on me, I made 'em wake up (Don't sleep)
From the bottom to the top (Don't sleep)
Half a mill in the yacht (Don't sleep)
'Cause I know

[Chorus: Dave 1 & P-Thugg]
Yeah, you've been sleepin' on me
Don't sleep, don't sleep on me
Don't sleep on me
(Don't sleep) on me
Yeah, you've been sleepin' on me
Don't sleep, don't sleep on me
Don't sleep, don't sleep on me
Don't sleep, don't sleep on me
Yeah, you've been sleepin' on me

[Verse 4: Stefflon Don]
If you only really known what you done to me
I had a crush on you but you never acknowledged me
Now when you see me you act the fuck up
Boy good luck I'm chucking my deuce up

[Outro: Dave 1 & P-Thugg]
Yeah, you've been sleepin' on me
