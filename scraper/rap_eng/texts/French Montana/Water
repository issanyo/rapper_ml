[Hook:]
See I could take you to the water
But can’t help you drink
See I could take you to the water
But can’t help you drink

Put your head right
The same night
We’re doing everything
To not break

Blood thicker than water
Blood thicker than water
Blood thicker than water
Blood thicker than water
Blood thicker than water
Blood thicker than water
Blood thicker than water

[Verse 1:]
Rich off net, now I triple my net worth
Hopping out the jet, shorty’s got that neck work
Started from a dollar baking soda wishes
When them hollows hit-cha niggas turning so religious
Million dollar me is got your baby momma creeping
Money rule her assets, that evil so possessive
Flashing, you know these niggas
Sloppy and they bogus niggas
Pass me with them stories, you ain’t half of what ya ho is

[Hook]

[Verse 2:]
Gotta do it on your own like fuck a witness
30 chains on it's a cold business
Stacking money up, I need 4 ceilings
Drinking bottle after bottle, I need 4 kidneys
Stacking hoes up, we need 4 sprinters
Versace shit, Silkk the shocker no limit
From the jump start we them cold killers
And you ain’t never dumped, you got 4 figures
Pray to God never get deported
Baby go and bust it open, let me pay your mortgage
Jewish marble, I ain’t need a carpet
Play the street, I don’t need a office

[Hook]

Ayo I got that Yemen and cheese all over her body
Mac & Cheese 3! On everything!
