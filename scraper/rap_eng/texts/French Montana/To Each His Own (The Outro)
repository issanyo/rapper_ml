[Intro]
Grind all night, long as I can ball tomorrow
Vested enough in it anyhow
To each his own
Goddamn them bitches scream so loud
Fuck my enemies, I’m gone ball
I don’t know, I’ll be dead or alive
To each his own

[Interlude – Broken Bells]
We're bound to wait all night
She's bound to run amok
Invested enough in it anyhow
To each his own
The garden is sorting out
She curls her lips on a barrel
I don't know if you're dead or not
To anyone

[Hook]
Fresh up out the counter
And all my niggas they’ll be honored
First thing on my mind in the morning
Is getting money
Mind on my money, getting money all the time
Getting money
Mind on my money, getting money all the time
Bitch we getting money
Mind on my money, getting money all the time
We getting money
Mind on my money, getting money all the time

[Verse 1]
Mind on my money, getting money all the time
Hundred on the watch, know you see me shining
Five bitches and they all dimes
Hit the dealer and we all buying
I never thought in a million years
I’m making deals, give my niggas million years
The dark shades for the rocky days
Was tryna find ways to part, now we parting ways
With my back against the wall
Smoking that loud
Don't front, you want to see me fall
Till my last dollar
Million dollar shit, put my emblem on
Shawty head retarded, put a helmet on
We had a heart, we had the heart
And now I charge your life to a plastic card
Been counting dirty money all night
And I’m probably gone do it tomorrow
And I don’t know if the day can talk
To each his own

Dead presidents to represent me
Dead presidents to represent me
Mad nigga just chilling, count it by the millions
Talking bout, all my niggas, all my guns, all my women
Can’t wait, my nigga Max bailed out
500 horses when I peel out
Shawty don’t judge me like a car lot
Show me love baby
Grind hard for everything you want
Got sacrifice for everything you love
Nobody, fucking with my niggas, nobody
Fore the deal happened ask a nigga
Nobody, could see me through them tears
Nobody, nobody

[Hook]
