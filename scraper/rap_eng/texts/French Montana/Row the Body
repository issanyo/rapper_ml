[Intro: French Montana]
Montana!
Y'all already know what it is
When you hear that, "Haan!"
Cruz it up
(Skrr, skrr)

[Hook: French Montana]
Shor-Shorty wanna boss, 'cause she bossed up (haan)
R-R-Riding down ocean with the doors up (haan)
Allen Ive can't cross us (haan)
Hit it no hands, the only time we lost touch
Stay down till we high five (haan)
Now's going down, like my timeline (haan)
South Bronx Slick Rick jewel (haan)
Slim Aarons with the click moves (haan)

[Verse 1: Taio Cruz]
I wanna give, wanna give what you needin'
You got that body, got that body I believe in
And if you bring it, if you bring it over here so
Give me a run so I can show you what I'm meanin'
You make me hot, make me hotter than a sauna
You made me wanna vote for you like Obama
And if you bring it, if you bring it over here so
Then, baby, we can grind, grind in a corner

[Pre-Chorus: Taio Cruz]
I want to, want to
Take my time on you, on you
Take your time on me
When you grind on me, just slide on me
Yeah, yeah

[Chorus: Taio Cruz]
Move your body to the left
Move your body to the right
Row da body in slow motion
Row da body all night
Move your body to the left
Move your body to the right
Row da body in slow motion
Row da body all night
Row da body say row, row
Row da body say row, row
Row da body say row, row
Row da body say row, row
Row da body

[Verse 2: Taio Cruz]
I wanna show you, wanna show you what you missin'
You got that thing I'm tryna put into position
And if you bring it, if you bring it over here so
Then I can school you like you paying me tuition
You make me bubble, made me bubble like a soda
Because your body curve, curve like Coca-Cola
And if you bring it, if you bring it over here so
Then, baby, we can grind, grind in the corner

[Pre-Chorus: Taio Cruz & French Montana]
I want to, want to
Take my time on you, on you
Take your time on me
When you grind on me, just slide on me
Yeah, yeah
Skrr, skrr

[Chorus: Taio Cruz]
Move your body to the left
Move your body to the right
Row da body in slow motion
Row a body all night
Move your body to the left
Move your body to the right
Row da body in slow motion
Row da body all night
Row da body say row, row
Row da body say row, row
Row da body say row, row
Row da body say row, row
Row da body

[Bridge: French Montana]
Montana!
Baby, I'm tryna get you on a vibe
Tryna get you on a flight
Make a movie like Spike (like Spike)
And if it's only for tonight
We gon' turn it to the max, you gon' remember me for life
Yachts pon da river-river, French vanilla sippin'-sippin'
Baby, I don't flip, unless the roof Lamborghini whip up
She got me begging like I'm homeless (homeless)
She mover her body like she's boneless (boneless)

[Chorus: Taio Cruz]
Move your body to the left
Move your body to the right
Row da body in slow motion
Row da body all night
Move your body to the left
Move your body to the right
Row da body in slow motion
Row da body all night
Row da body say row, row
Row da body say row, row
Row da body say row, row
Row da body say row, row

[Outro]
Row da body say row, row
Row da body say row, row
Row da body say row, row
Row da body say row, row
Row da body
