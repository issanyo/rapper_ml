[Hook]
The scars of your love, remind me of us
They keep me thinking that we almost had it all
The scars of your love, they leave me breathless
I can't help feeling
We could have had it all
Rolling in the deep
You had my heart inside your hand
And you played it
To the beat

[Verse One: Chinx Drugz]
Look, I peep the game through that wide lens
Haters like "why him? " and not them
Niggas get played like violins
Try not to sin
Neutral but I'm with 5 brims
Niggas like to smoke weed and ride rims you ain't high as them
That money coming I'm feeling good
That blicka on me I wish a nigga would
Wrist stupid yo bitch scooped me
You just started playing ball I been hoopin'

[Hook]

[French Montana:]
I'm a coke boy I'm a coke boy I'm a I'm a I'm a aye aye

Look at time on my audemar, grind all day so I can ball tomorrow
Talk to my money nigga heart to heart, settle for a [?] that's an R & R
Now now now you wanna tag along
Coulda been here coulda had it all
You know we coulda rock-rocked the stage
Now all u can do is just rap along
1-4-8 and I moved in it said fucked the game and rules in it
Top off the drop when we cruise in it
New fly crib in it 2 pools in it
Me and Chinx Drugz on i5
New York nigga in the sky box
Pent house suite watch time fly
All them fly freaks wanna stop by
They talk bout the money nigga now this
Blue and white chain call it maverick
I'm on them notes nigga high pitch
Spend that money nigga high risk
Hit these streets got my cake up
Live your dream and never wake up
I'm ballin mane, tourin mane
Coke boy team is what they call us mane

[Hook]
