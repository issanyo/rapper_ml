(Hook)
Money and power, that's the only religion
Pray to GOD that we make it, hit the streets and go get it
I want it all, yea
I want it all, yea
Yea!
Money and power! That's the only religion!
When you're gunnin with me, hit the streets and go get it
I want it all
I want it all
Money and power, that's just part of my niggas
Rest in peace to J Money, we livin life til we end it
My religion is true but I just copped me some robbins
Niggas switch up on they niggas til them niggas is poppin
///
Only reason niggas out they gave advice to the feds
I want it all
I want it all
Dreads don't make you Haitian, guess you don't curse you a Christian
Niggas die for attention, I pray to God for my niggas
Some believe in the devil, the Illuminati got levels
Niggas giving up they family for them cribs and some balance
Niggas changing under pressure, two gun cases can't tell em
I could tell niggas tellin', I lost my bro to the battle
I want it all, I want it all

(Hook)
Money and power, that's the only religion
Niggas out there be hatin, hit the streets and go get it
I want it all, yea
I want it all, yea
Yea!
Money and power! That's the only religion!
When you're gunnin with me, hit the streets and go get it
I want it all
I want it all

(Verse)
I seen how them niggas go on and step on yo fingers
Told my mama I love her and sin who don't believe us
Niggas pay me they brothers and they right here if we need em
But I went through the trauma, I seen nobody but Jesus
Got caught up by the life, I got right out bout a price
Now these niggas takin credits what we did on them nice
I had it all all all, on just 6 I hit the ball
Want it all, I got it all, in the streets I took a loss
Once I reopen them blockers, these niggas mad they can't stop us
Everywhere you go these niggas always know we the topic
All black hoodie, no body, they drink it up like the shotters
But we watchin who watches them niggas sayin they got it
I can't trust these niggas, I can't fuck with these niggas
I got up in these niggas, then I'mma up on these niggas
I want it all all all
I want it all all yea

(Hook)
Money and power, that's the only religion
Niggas out there be hatin, hit the streets and go get it
I want it all, yea
I want it all, yea
Yea!
Money and power! That's the only religion!
When you're gunnin with me, hit the streets and go get it
I want it all
I want it all
