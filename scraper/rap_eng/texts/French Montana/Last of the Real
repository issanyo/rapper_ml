[Intro]
I'm gangsta
Alright, aye

[Hook: Mavado]
We the last of the real
Who can't hear must feel
Last of the real
My gun speak louder than words
The last of the real
Who can't hear must feel
Last of the real
My gun speak louder than words

[Verse 1: French Montana]
Stay strapped, got a big number one supersized Big Mac
3-57 in the 57 Maybach
Made you fucking niggas sloppy
I be Rocky A$AP, lay you down face flat
Man the last of the real, stackin the mills
I ain't talkin bout no lipstick when that Mac in your grill
Last of a dying breed, when I fire these
Hundred rounds, niggas start speaking Guyanese
Got a clip and a chopper full of flower seeds
Niggas hanging all choppers where your momma sleep
We the best coke boys, nigga you ain't heard

[Bridge: Mavado]
My gun speak louder than words

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Ace Hood]
Okay now play like I'm pussy, killas fuck up your night
20 goons in your kitchen, while you skyping your wife
Like where the stash? In the safe
It ain't no asking you twice
My trigger finger be itching, that bitch be switching them mic
I'm like the last of the real
Rolling on a half of a pill
Jumping off that bucket for real
30 niggas equipped with the steel
You don't want them problems, you don't want that drama
Running off your mouth, you must be bonkers
You don't love your momma, then a town with marbles
Black on black, feeling like I knew Obama
And I do no commerce
Two door coupes is white as miss Madonna
Motherfuck the loyal to your honor
Money and power, I talk that shit, nigga you ain't heard

[Bridge + Hook]

[Verse 3: Mavado]
Last of the real, blue steel
We the best, we the realest
Me and Montana, never leave my home without the burner
Stop with my real vest
The last of the real, the one with the money and the whores
Boy fat pussy, finding bleeding on the floor
Blood clot, real to the floor
They don't make us no more
We the last of the real
Who can't hear must feel
Last of the real
My gun speak louder than words
My gun speak louder than words
Ra pa pam speak louder than words

[Hook]
