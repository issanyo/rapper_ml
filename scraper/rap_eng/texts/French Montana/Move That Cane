Yo know that boy Flame
Know I do my thang

Damn I move that thang

Know I do my thing

Damn I move that thang

Shorty looking right
Trying to fuck tonight
You know I move the white, snow, girl
Boy, Flame

Damn I move that thang I got that dro

[Verse 1: French Montana]
Drop that money, spend that money
Never switch up, fuck that money
Nigga hustle, get that money
Industry hoes I fucked about 20
Motherfucking right I hustle
Motherfucking right we gonna win
And my niggas got that drop
Motherfucking right I'm in
Slick talk, pimp talk
Benz truck, leather seat
Tensed up, fifth spark, hit the club, a 100 deep
Motherfucking right I die for mine
Starting from grinding and I hold mine
Tell them fly bitches nigga hold on
Grinding on the track like a four line
Hold on, roll one, slow money better than no money
Slow grind, blow my, can on this when its showtime
Boy, Mane, you know I move that thang
Just cop that whole thang
Hit the block and move that cane

[Verse 2: Waka Flocka Flame]
I'm high, fucked up, on another level
I'm high, fucked up, on another level
Fuck you beginners, Brick Squad Monopoly
We the new Supreme Team, you can call me Kenneth
I ain't worried about no haters, I ain't worried about no bitch
I ain't worried about a cop, all a nigga know is getting it
Standing on the block
Put it all in, pain and sore
I lock and load and when I see a enemy I just let it go
Pow pow pow
Fuck a bitch, and fuck a hater (fuck em)
Light a blunt pour a couple for a fucking hater
Ride these rims, shorty fuck these bitches
I'm from Grove Street, all I know is this
