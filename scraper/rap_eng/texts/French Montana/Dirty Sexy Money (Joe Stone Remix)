[Intro: Charli XCX]
Woah, woooh
Woah, woooh

[Pre-Chorus: Charli XCX]
Woooh, tell me what you want and I can do it to you
I'm a million dollars, make your wishes come true
Calling out you're, calling out, calling out you're
Never seen a girl like this before

[Chorus: Charli XCX]
If you wanna pu-pu-pu-pu-put it on me
You're not gonna ge-ge-ge-ge-get it for free
Come on spend that dirty sexy money on me, on me, on me
You got to pull up, pull up, pull up, pull up
If you wanna do-do-do-do-do it freaky
24/7, no-no-no-no-no sleep
Come on put that dirty sexy money on me, on me, on me
You got to pull up
If you wanna pu-pu-pu-pu-put it on me
You're not gonna ge-ge-ge-ge-get it for free
Come on spend that dirty sexy money on me, on me, on me
You got to pull up, pull up, pull up, pull up

[Verse 1: Charli XCX]
Put your skin on my skin, on my skin
Love it when we touchin', love it when we fuckin', my love
Make you high in a heartbeat, yeah

[Pre-Chorus: Charli XCX]
Woooh, tell me what you want and I can do it to you
I'm a million dollars, make your wishes come true
Calling out you're, calling out, calling out you're
Never seen a girl like this before

[Chorus: Charli XCX]
If you wanna pu-pu-pu-pu-put it on me
You're not gonna ge-ge-ge-ge-get it for free
Come on spend that dirty sexy money on me, on me, on me
You got to pull up, pull up, pull up, pull up
If you wanna do-do-do-do-do it freaky

All I want is you, you
Tunnel vision, you, you
All I need is you, I'ma put it on you (you)
