[Intro]
Cola
Montana, haaan

[Verse 1: Kay Cola]
Eyes are so perfect
The perfect shade of gray
And when you lie they light up your whole face
I love that I know you
I know you what you're gonna say
But I'll play along anyway

[Pre-Hook: Kay Cola]
I already went through your phone
So, so good luck with her, I'm so done

[Hook: Kay Cola]
I can't wait for you to call me
Just so I can ignore it, babe
Boy I see you calling
I ain't messing with you, baby
And I can't wait to see you
Just to act like I don't know you, babe
I already told you
I ain't messing with you
Not-not-not okay
Not-not-not okay
Not-not-not okay
I ain't messing with you

[Verse 2: Kay Cola]
Sending me flowers
Sending messages everyday (aww)
Sweet it is of you to think of me
She know you still love me
And she's your big mistake
Does she play along anyway?

[Pre-Hook: Kay Cola]
I bet she already went through your phone
So good luck with her, I'm so done

[Hook: Kay Cola]
I can't wait for you to call me
Just so I can ignore it, babe
Boy I see you calling
I ain't messing with you, baby
And I can't wait to see you
Just to act like I don't know you, babe
I already told you
I ain't messing with you
Not-not-not okay
Not-not-not okay
Not-not-not okay
I ain't messing with you

[Verse 3: French Montana]
(Montana, woo, haaan)
I'mma fall way back
All that weird shit, we don't play that
Suited up like court case
Birds on my arm like Ghostface
I'mma keep it one hundred with you
Spend time fucking with you
Shawty fell in love with a rider
Was in the wrong place when I found her
Ah, every other city we go
Same songs, same videos
From L.A. to the N.O., ah
Haaan

[Hook: Kay Cola]
I can't wait for you to call me
Just so I can ignore it, babe
Boy I see you calling
I ain't messing with you, baby
And I can't wait to see you
Just to act like I don't know you, babe
I already told you
I ain't messing with you
Not-not-not okay (no)
Not-not-not okay (no-no-no-not-not-not okay)
Not-not-not okay (no, no, not okay)
I ain't messing with you
