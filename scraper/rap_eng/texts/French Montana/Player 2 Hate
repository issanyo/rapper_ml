[Hook: Mally Mall]
All I do is get cake, time is money so I’m over paid
Private jets bump state to state, I ain't mad, I’m a player to hate
Player to hate, player to hater
I ain't mad I'm the player to hate
Player to hate, player to hater
I ain't mad I'm the player to hate

[Verse 1: Mr. Capone-E]
30 racks on my table
Independent money, that's the label
Breaking eggs cause we balling
Yeah I got money like Khaled
Private jets, paid trips
Fresh whips, homie on a whole 'nother ship
The zip to zip, I got too many hoes
Like Luda says, in ever area code
Shows the loves, the people in the place
You said you a king, but I'm the ace
Young Richard Branson, no record we smashing
Your girl we taxing, take her to my mansion
Pablo Escobar demeanor
All white like Justin Bieber
We get paid, no dreamer
Haters gonna hate but y'all sitting on the bleachers

[Hook: Mally Mall]
All I do is get cake, time is money so I’m over paid
Private jets bump state to state, I ain't mad, I’m a player to hate
Player to hate, player to hater
I ain't mad I'm the player to hate
Player to hate, player to hater
I ain't mad I'm the player to hate

[Verse 2: French Montana]
New money, new year, found some new looks
New cribs, new sets, get some new crews
Getting to this money, bullshit to the side
Mixing pills with the drink, leaning to the side
Young nigga balling like Pablo
41 shots, I'mma do [?]
Montana pimping like Goldie
Old school, new school, got nothing for me
5 on drink, drink quarter mil
4 finger ring, 6 lay up paint
Put it on my mansion, young nigga flashing
[?]

[Hook: Mally Mall]
All I do is get cake, time is money so I’m over paid
Private jets bump state to state, I ain't mad, I’m a player to hate
Player to hate, player to hater
I ain't mad I'm the player to hate
Player to hate, player to hater
I ain't mad I'm the player to hate

[Verse 3: Mr. Capone-E]
Back counting stacks, call me [?]
8 mil my friends, presidential like [?]
So much money, they call me Floyd
Columbian stealer, a real cold boy
West coast, east coast, they connected
Got underground tunnels in Texas
Rep this new boy on the block
I get paid every time a G talk
7 figures, kiss my ring
Major connections all the way to Beijing
Prince of my city, royal to the fashion
They call me Michael but I ain't getting Jacksons
I'mma [?] mobster
Got bricks and them choppers
Aftermath without a doctor
This ain't no acting so pass me my Oscar

[Hook: Mally Mall]
All I do is get cake, time is money so I’m over paid
Private jets bump state to state, I ain't mad, I’m a player to hate
Player to hate, player to hater
I ain't mad I'm the player to hate
Player to hate, player to hater
I ain't mad I'm the player to hate
