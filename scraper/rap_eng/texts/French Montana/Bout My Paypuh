[Intro: French Montana]
Montana
6FO

[Verse 1: 6FO]
Yeah, I been broke then got fixed
Unknown now top pick
Do well now they say, I'm raw off my dick
Ramen noodles don't let the food fool yah
Been through the struggle so I had to hustle
O2 cube to a H to a B
Cause of them letters, I done cop me a V
Hella palms and a food server
Sell it out but keep your mouth full
I got new neighbors

[Hook: 6FO and (French Montana)]
I'm bout my paypuh!
Said I need my money now
Live without it, how?
I go broke, I'm running back
I'm bout my paypuh!
(Ohhhhhh, Oh Oh Ohhhhhh)
I'm bout my paypuh!
Said I need my money now
Live without it, how?
I go broke, I'm running back
I'm bout my paper
(Ohhhhhh, Oh Oh Ohhhhhh)
I'm bout my paypuh!

[Verse 2: 6FO]
I been broke then got fixed
Unknown now top pick
Do well now they say, I'm raw off my dick
Ramen noodles don't let the food fool yah
Been through the struggle so I had to hustle
O2 cube to a H to a B
Cause of them letters, I done cop me a V(skrt skrt)
Hella palms and a food server
Sell it out but keep your mouth full
I got new neighbors
All this money coming in
It's bringing new haters
And a whole lotta women, I'm talking new flavors
All dreams now real real
Don't [?] my stainless steal
Throw more when I bang the wheel
Like hi hater, fuck how you feel
My bad but your girl bad
It only made sense that I spank
Nike box to that hard safe
That hard safe to the bank
Lawyer money ready, case I'm going to court
My life is so real, please don't play this in court
I said, lawyer money ready, case I'm going to court
My life is so real, please don't play this in court

[Hook: 6FO and (French Montana)]
I'm bout my paypuh!
Said I need my money now
Live without it, how?
I go broke, I'm running back
I'm bout my paypuh!
(Ohhhhhh, Oh Oh Ohhhhhh)
I'm bout my paypuh!
Said I need my money now
Live without it, how?
I go broke, I'm running back
I'm bout my paper
(Ohhhhhh, Oh Oh Ohhhhhh)
I'm bout my paypuh!

[Verse 3: French Montana]
Ready, Set, Go for that paper run a marathon
Look at 88, dapper down with hair and bone
I'm still gonna be the realest when the show is over
Flip the 8 into a [?], copped my first Rover
Hit the kitchen, water whip
Now whip to the yacht, baby water whippin
Round bag that bitch, want more women
Counting up that paper, gotta watch it, stay close
And my whip ain't got no top
My bitch ain't got no top
My gun ain't got no safety
Fill this money, it ain't safe
Round bag that bitch, one motion
I'm talking white pills, yellow pills, comatose
Baby rock, wave with it
Nigga come on closer
Caught a mill, spend it with a chauffeur
[?]
With Montana, big baby popping
Hollywood, cop a crib, on them hills popping

[Hook: 6FO and (French Montana)]
I'm bout my paypuh!
Said I need my money now
Live without it, how?
I go broke, I'm running back
I'm bout my paypuh!
(Ohhhhhh, Oh Oh Ohhhhhh)
I'm bout my paypuh!
Said I need my money now
Live without it, how?
I go broke, I'm running back
I'm bout my paper
(Ohhhhhh, Oh Oh Ohhhhhh)
I'm bout my paypuh!
