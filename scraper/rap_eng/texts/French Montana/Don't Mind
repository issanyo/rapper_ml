[Intro: French Montana]
You niggas sound crazy to me
You ain't recalling what you claiming to be
And I don't like it

[Verse 1: French Montana]
You talking about me in the streets and I don't like it
You running with them people I don't like it
If she ain't got no cheeks I don't like it
She ain't bringing no freaks I don't like it

[Verse 2: Fabolous]
No face, no case, dab, no face, no case, dab
D-Brown these hoes, dab, D-Brown these hoes, dab
French, Ferg, and who? Fab, French, Ferg, and who? Fab
Setting up that hook, jab, setting up that hook, jab

[Verse 3: French Montana]
French, Ferg, and who? Fab, came back with a new bag
Frank Lucas blue bag, came through coupe black
Upper cut, two jabs, paid for, two stacks
LV's, no strap, hearing them, who that

[Verse 4: A$AP Ferg]
My bitch is too bad, her booty is too fat
The new 2 Live Crew, dag, me, French, and who? Fab
Goyard my boo bag, Dior my shoes, damn
Iced out my tooth and I Baped out my durag

[Verse 5: Fabolous]
From BX to Harlem, ending up in BK
You don't want no problem, cook beef like cheese steak
On me so freaky, ella dice dique
Balling on some new shit, this NBA 3K

[Verse 6: A$AP Ferg]
Still go to the PJ's, fuck a bitch where she stay
Can't come to the new crib, she ain't getting no leeway
Probably fucked your new bitch, don't believe what she say
But the bitch a klepto, I seen my shit on Ebay

[Hook: Fabolous & (A$AP Ferg)]
If you want me to blow the bag, I don't mind
If you want to come fuck my swag I don't mind
All through the night (I don't mind)
I said all through the night (yeah yeah yeah yeah)
If you want me to blow the bag I don't mind
If you want to come fuck my swag I don't mind
All through the night (I don't mind)
I said all through the night (yeah yeah yeah yeah)

[Verse 7: A$AP Ferg]
Put 40 on my neck, and 20 on her wrist
Black card in her ass, and you can sweat like this
She in love with my crew, but I don't give two shits
And I ain't wear no vest Fab, you can snipe my bitch

[Verse 8: Fabolous]
Blowing up my phone, wow, showing up to my home, wow
How I'm posed to stop, how, stop acting crazy, how
Whip on my wrist, wow, whipping my wrist, wow
Got me popping that Crystal, like its '96 now

[Verse 9: French Montana]
I pull up out that pussy tell her hold up
Pull up to the club getting paid like a promoter
We pull niggas throw up, you got a bad bitch, I got 30 of those
Red bottoms cost 30 Jordans

[Hook: Fabolous & (A$AP Ferg)]
If you want me to blow the bag I don't mind
If you want to come fuck my swag I don't mind
All through the night (I don't mind)
I said all through the night (yeah yeah yeah yeah)
If you want me to blow the bag I don't mind
If you want to come fuck my swag I don't mind
All through the night (I don't mind)
I said all through the night (yeah yeah yeah yeah)
