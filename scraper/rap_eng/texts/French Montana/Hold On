[Intro: French Montana]
Hold on to your life

[Hook: French Montana]
If you want to do it, take your time, do it right
You can do it baby
Get your money right

[Verse 1: Max B]
At two fifths [?], I had the plan made
Nigga got his food ate, patch it up with a Band-Aid
Max mayonnaise, macaroni cheese, and mustard
Your bitches look musty
Shit got me disgusted
Clusters, droop off the left wrist
I think I got a death wish
Sitting back, suicidal thoughts of doing it, hitting the switch
All of my niggas can move a brick, I can move the shit
On a slow day, no play, okay
I was speaking of my bitch Oshay
And as we roll on, hold on to your love
Mami fiendin', she want more drugs
Shakin' it, she going through withdrawals
Big pitfalls, about to be the shit dawg
Can't a nigga stop what I'm bringing
Singing, sounding all good
I'm known in all around the hoods, Max B

[Hook: French Montana]
If you want to do it, take your time, do it right
You can do it baby
Get your money right

[Verse 2: French Montana]
Get high 'til we can't see
Your rap career over, look for plan B
These rap niggas softer than cotton candy
I ain't a boss, all my niggas family
Every nigga near me got a gun just as big as Camby
And that's Marcus, open coffins
Bootleg cable, and bitch you get what you bring to the table
Got shrimp and spaghetti, and Prego sauce
Getting my boy polished, homie bend those off
And I hear knocking, it's the Wavy Crockett
With more hoes from river road, with more O's and plenty rolls
From food stamps and week checks
Now I smack a bitch with 100 stacks off a reflex
That's a jackpot, 650 with the rag top
And Pillsbury for a mascot

[Hook: French Montana]
If you want to do it, take your time, do it right
You can do it baby
Get your money right

[Verse 3: Tony Yayo]
S.O.D, swammies on deck homie
My killers OD and die for respect homie
The barrel of my gun start to precum
Fiending to bust, I'm loaded when the D's come
G-Unit is a money-making fountain
25 on my wrist, my chicken [?] in the [?]
Kick a nigga in the head, football, punt a nigga
And snap a nigga quick like a London nigga
Your career is a blunder nigga, mine is promise
I wear a nine in the snakeskin proudest
With a nine and a chick that's chasing dollars
Like I'm chasing dollars by any means necessary
A nigga's neck is heavy, let the caviar dreams thaw out
I'm in the hood with the Porsche out
To the G5 turbulation
To fly to Dubai, where they're camel racing

[Hook: French Montana]
If you want to do it, take your time, do it right
You can do it baby
Get your money right
