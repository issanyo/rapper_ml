[verse 1]
Cold killa, guerrilla
You ain't fuckin' with my niggas slime
Swerrrdgang we in here slime, my young boys very wild
We be all up in BK [brooklyn], my niggas bang like everyday
When that AK sprrrrrrrrr-ay, nigga move get out the way
What you know bout 60 racks, in the hood like yea im back
I got a 9 to 5 i ain't selling crack, jail i ain't going back
Haters love when they see you fallin', bitches love when they see crawling
About 20 ray-bans a couple Jordans
Yea a nigga ballin!

[hook: french montana]
I be countin' money till my thumbs hurt
