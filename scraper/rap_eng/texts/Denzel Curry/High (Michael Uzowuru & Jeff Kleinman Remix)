[Verse 1: Yukimi]
I guess we'll never get started
Let's save the silence all night
No need for talking about it
Sometimes, the quiet feels so right

[Chorus: Yukimi]
High
Over the north star
Sleepless, so far
Together, we are
High
Trapped in the holiday affair
A new silence filled the air

[Verse 2: Denzel Curry]
Don't let my lean spill
I let my blunt burn
I watch my wounds heal and watch the world turn
Now who woulda thought I'd make it this far
I gotta thank God for all of my scars
Under the new star, I'm high as the solar
Rise above a cold world, the glow is [?]
I'm all good, I'm alright I go hard cause this gon' be my last night

[Verse 3: Yukimi]
I rest my head on your shoulder
There's nowhere else I'd rather be
Right there, a little bit slower
Feel free to roll another one for me
(Roll another one for me)

[Chorus: Yukimi]
High
Over the north star
Sleepless, so far
Together, we are
High
Trapped in the holiday affair
A new silence filled the air

[Bridge: Yukimi]
Making way, we sway, we slide, oh
One flight to space, soothing you
It's too good to be true, have more on a rooftop view
Making way, we sway, we slide, oh

[Chorus: Yukimi]
High
Over the north star
Sleepless, so far
Together, we are
High
Trapped in the holiday affair
A new silence filled the air

[Outro: Yukimi]
High
High
High
High
