[Intro]
You know I'm saying, strictly for my raiders nigga
I had to get 2 niggas, you know I'm saying
These raiders my nigga, Champ Fway, Harvey G
Man, give 'em that phone my nigga
Black man radio
Troublesome

[Beat drop]

Strictly for my raiders, [?]
Black Man Radio 66.6, nigga

[Verse 1]
[?]
Snapping niggas' necks, Macho Man, Randy Savage
All my hoes the baddest, [?] 'em like magnets
If I see George then my man, I'll blast him
They look like we ain't equal
Turnin' us against our own people
No [?], pure evil
Not transparent, I see you
Tell the truth and they ain't believe you
Only live once, you better think twice (think about it)
[?] they'll come and snatch your life
This chess, not checkers, not rolling dice
