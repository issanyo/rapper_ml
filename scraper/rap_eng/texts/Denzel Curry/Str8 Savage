[Verse 1: Yung Simmie]
These niggas lightweight fightin a champion
I pull up with the simmie niggas askin what happen
Yeah I spit dope like a nigga be trappin
Flow wet can you pass me a napkin?
Imma vet with yo bitch I be makin it happen
You a internet thug talkin bout you be clappin
I'm a real like Mac told yo bitch cuz she asked me
Flow just nasty
All in yo face like acne
Coolin wit my dogs like shaggy
My bitch hold a strap no tranny
I'm concrete you candy
Hot fire flame might make your bitch fan me
Shots at your family
Glock to your granny
I run up in yo yard like the dog don't scare me
He get two shots too
You step dad and your pops too
Now your stuck and its not glue
I can draw one Glock cuz I got two
I spit thunderbolts
I'm Riachu
I put the guns away
And Mike Tys' you
I give em straight bars I indite you
No fed tho
Hollow tips straight to a nigga head tho
I cut his ease off
Make him beg tho
I tell my girlfriend
Grab his legs hoe
I cut his head off I'm the head honcho

[Verse 2: Denzel Curry]
What the fuck is up with these niggas conscious
I do a nigga like how Drizzy did Common
Common sense I am not the one to plot against
Cuz you know Curry is ultimate
Coming down coming round hearing a hundred rounds
I'm from a place where they run it down
Even tho its the future it feels like the past and the present is passin my blunt around
Will it ever change like a parking meter When I park niggas spark the heat up
Man down or Nelson Mandela put behind the bars
We the best seller in the underground I'm the best seller
Niggas think I sold out
Only way that to happen is if they took my soul out
All swag re [?]
In that's no doubt
Take em out missin like they whoopie goldberg's eyebrows
Didn't like to hear me now they fear me
This for all the niggas who dont know bout the truth
Why you think the magazines cover people like you
You ain't talkin bout shit yet they do what you do
Corruptin to youth
Invasion of the wack shit to lame
This is a taste test of my black dick
Fuckin up environment
Lives in the entire run
Face the wrath of my mothafuckin Gallic gun
Bitches ain't shit and niggas ain't either
I am not kidding I'll send em to a reaper
That's a jk that's a damn shame how the game played late
Raised in the un-tamed county of Dade
