[Verse 1: Dyemond Lewis]
Ain't no rich nigga, no bitch nigga
But I still take a rich nigga's bitch
Bitch you clocking on, she jocking off, she topping off the whole Era clique
That pussy drip, but none of my Pros had touched the clit
That shit must hurt, but karma hurt way worse
So I hope some nigga ain't fucking my bitch when I'm out here doing this verse
When I'm out here doing my dirt
When I'm out here putting in work
When I'm out here copping some work
When I'm out here let me hit Kirk
Let me see if these niggas really, really want war
Cause I heard these niggas really, really be soft
And I hurt these niggas if I heard these niggas really, really had beef with any of my niggas
But I ain't no killer
I'm apex [?]
Put the Pro first cause you know we vets
R.I.P.  S-T-double E-Z, yes
And you know it's easy, yes
It's D-I-M-E-Z
They like D-I-M-E-Z throw the pussy at your [?]
So I never have to fiend
I'm too real for you
Showing off my skills for you
I finished this verse at 1 AM so I called this Nyctophilia

[Verse 2: Denzel Curry]
Finish him, Scorpion
Reactions as a tortoise
Where my reinforcements step into your fortress
Ol' Dirty Bastard, you are nothing to an orphan preaching to Picasso
So how to make the pieces of your portrait
A little bit less square
The motherfucking father figure
Cause I'm the best here
Comparing yourself to me, you niggas ain't thinking right
Buddy you Sierra Mist
That's compared to dirty Sprite
I'm the future of this shit, I ain't talking Future's wife
Shout out to P.E., these niggas ain't physically fit
Me and Dyemond and Nyck running through hoes like the six
Ex-tend your arm, cause I rap from the pit
So it's a must that all of my niggas drop gangsta shit
U-L-T to the death of me
Give a fuck about the black and white
You could be a zebra combined with a referee
See now nigga that's real abrupt
Wrote this shit for Nyck so I guess I guees itâ€™s Nyctophilia

[Verse 3: Nyck Caution]
I say, who the fuck is this?
Nycky pissed don't ever doubt it
Me and Dyemond dropping diamonds, under pressure 'till we sprouted that
That's a flower out the concrete
I see you cowards talking
Comedy, but in person y'all want harmony
And that shit don't make no sense
Y'all just bother me, you ain't got no heart, no artery
And why would I waste my art on garbage with no fucking artistry?
So on that note switch the topic
I ain't brushing on it any longer
I see my future, you ain't even know I'm ready for it
Drop my woman for these milestones that I'm reaching
Plus she need some time to grow
Now who I'm lying to?
She just keep on texting, but who the fuck replying?
It ain't me, I cut these strings
She's a puppet, I'm implying that it's nothing
I won't hold my breath to find another interruption
I don't mean to trip, but what I've seen is just disgusting
So I keep it raw then fuck a broad that got the common interest
And then it's right back to the music, my regards
But I toss them when I'm finished
Treat these women like cigar
Clips, Nycky in the present just ain't feeling ya
Deleted that text at 2 AM so I call this Nyctophilia
Nyctophilia, that Nyctophilia
Gimme that neck when I got my check
These hoes ain't really feeling ya
