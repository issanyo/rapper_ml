[Intro: Denzel Curry]
Yeah, my guns all green, now the same color as my game
Run around in a fish tank, fuck around in a fish
Run around in a fish, run around in a fish, run around in a fish tank, Fuck a cell, underwater tank

[Verse 1: Mike Dece]
High as fuck up in a fish tank, holding my dreadlocks on the thing
Got sluts [?] I'm placing my penis up on her plate
That bitch eat a dick like a snake
We gon' ask around, I fuck like [?]
Jizz up on her teeth, fluorodine the toothpaste
Residing in the ocean that bitch is a [?]
Fuckin' with my family get a gun up in your face, they tryna steal my land because I luminate
Never take account I was [?]
Got, got her on her knees like a [?]
Hit the police with piece, 5-0, all cowards
Glock to his head now, that's a clock till he's dead, now you tell me who got the power!

[Verse 2: Denzel Curry]
Rest in power, it's all about power
Squeeze two lemons together and really all you'll have is sour, sour
Diesel, niggas'll smoke your ass to have the juice
Riding around in an all black coupe
Couple of pigeons that's ready to shoot, shit
Ducking and bucking and dodging and dropping
Ducking and bucking and dodging and dropping
With 48 ounces and cigarette butts
Fucking around with the upper echelon, they will turn you to cubes and I hope you be gone
Overload, overload, cranium overdose, Denny Cascade, what the fuck is the halves
Click clack, get powed, bitch, it's a wrap
Tierra my witness, I pray for a nap
Youngin' and restless, return with a past
Key in ignition, foot on the gas
None of you niggas ain't hearin' that jab
Gold teeth in the Glock and a Cybertech mask
Ring gun, particles, turn you into molecules
Planet shrooms, planet shrooms, I'll take you to my panic room
Grab a leaf when I wanna smoke, Fiji water when I wanna drink Yeah, my guns all green, now the same color as my game, run around in a fish tank
Fuck a cell, underwater tank
Take your bitch to Saturn, take her to outer space
Grab a leaf when I wanna smoke, Fiji water when I wanna drink
Grab a leaf when I wanna smoke, Fiji water when I wanna drink
Grab a leaf when I wanna smoke, Fiji water when I wanna drink
Yeah, my guns all green
Yeah, my guns all green
Yeah, my-Yeah, my all green, now the same color as my game, run around in a fish tank
Fuck a cell, underwater tank
Take your bitch to Saturn, take her to outer space
