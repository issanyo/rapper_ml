[Verse 1: Denzel Curry]
I feel like Huey's last words before he died
You can kill a rebel but the revolution survives
Every real nigga in history, always crucified
Quote wrong rhymes then read the lines and feed 'em to feeble minds
Food for die, my dialect you digest that's on the daily
Roses are red, violets are blue, brothers pushing up daisies
They say justice is blind, let me ask this, if that was a fact, then
She would be livin' in blackness, that resembles my black skin
X'd out Malcolm Little then left him left Detroit Red
Marked in a mausoleum for leadin' the mislead
This for the crackers that thinkin' they are Judge Dredd
That turn a prophecy when I come and I cut your head

[Chorus: Elohim]
In the pale fire, we hide out
Lay back and get down
(Hands up, don't shoot, hands up, don't shoot
Hands up, don't shoot, hands up, don't shoot)
In the pale fire, we hide out
Lay back and get down

[Verse 2: Darnell Williams]
Straight up, fuck the police, stay out for nigga dick, bitch
They shootin' without reason, or huntin', it's nigga season
He moanin', he couldn't breathe and they did him just like Rahim
After Tray got shot by the [?]
I taste blood while sippin' my tea
Put a couple chains on my neck because honestly I'm not free
What the fuck do you want from me? Steady killin' off all the kings
Tired of turnin' the other cheek and still gettin' our asses beat
That's that bullshit, please don't believe that Obama can do a thing
Except give us another speech about how we should keep the peace, nigga
I'm through with the protest, need a bulletproof vest
Underneath my crew neck, with two TECs, I won't be who's next
Motherfuck yo' cop badge, yo' soft ass a bitch and a half
That's word to Boosie and any hood that's bein' harassed, blast

[Chorus: Elohim]
In the pale fire, we hide out
Lay back and get down
(Hands up, don't shoot, hands up, don't shoot
Hands up, don't shoot, hands up, don't shoot)
In the pale fire, we hide out
Lay back and get down

[Verse 3: Darnell Williams]
Get chest pains everytime I see the news, type of blues
Leave a nigga leave a nigga stressed before he lacin' shoes
I'm lookin' at channel 2, brothers dyin' on some crazy shit
Tears flood the street from the mothers 'cause they baby hit
Ask us, "Is we scared?" Hell yeah man, a lil' bit
'Cause all this pigment made us targets since some little kids
Fuck the politics, Jesse Jackson can go suck a dick
It's evident that nigga care only in front of CNN
We livin' it, life at the bottom of the pyramid
Foolishness, it's crazy 'cause our ancestors built this shit
Royal blood in me, not a thug, I'm a fuckin' prince
Raised in the ghetto, lost my history on the slavery ship

[Chorus: Elohim]
In the pale fire, we hide out
Lay back and get down
(Hands up, don't shoot, hands up, don't shoot
Hands up, don't shoot, hands up, don't shoot)
In the pale fire, we hide out
Lay back and get down
(Hands up, don't shoot, hands up, don't shoot
Hands up, don't shoot, hands up)
