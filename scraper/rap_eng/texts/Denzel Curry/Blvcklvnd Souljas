[Verse 1: Denzel Curry]
Riding down the strip, bumping to some Pac (Pac bitch)
Nigga get the shot from the double Glock
Gun play nigga, it's that Triple C
Coming out hard, it's that MJG
Slide with the Klan, bitch you better not slip
Caught his ass slipping from the full clip
Grill that motherfucker, let that AK rip
T.I.P., bitch I got them sticks like TIP
Fuck a Burger King, if a nigga want beef
Bang bang on a bitch, like I'm Chief Keef (bang bang)
Bitches got pressure, lay a nigga six feet
R.K. all day, catch a motherfucker that's on the creep
Niggas is poppin', so death is your option
Your body gets shot till your brain is in fronted
I cut it, I chop it, you niggas is droppin'
A bullet is knocking, is harder to snuff
Run from the gauge, or run from the TEC
Really little niggas, you don't wanna see death
Really little niggas, you don't wanna see death
Really little nigga, you don't wanna see death

[Verse 2: Soulja Mook]
Strolling down the street, bumping that P, gripping that master beat
45 on my belt, you get dealt like niggas in Vegas be
Fuck that shit, I'mma hit 'em where it hurt
Knock a nigga out, then put him in a verse
Lay a nigga out, then put it on a shirt
Wrap up the tie, then put him in a hearse
Villainistic shit when I take your bitch and unload my clip
Everglades ride, let's take that trip
Cement shoes so your ass don't slip
Go and roe your boat, gently down the stream
I got snipers in the bushes that shoot like swat teams
Real nigga shit, I been 'bout mine
Killing these beats like I'm tote my nine
Yapping this shit like I bump on grind
BatKave nigga like I'm going kinda blind
Brooklyn shit, like we bikers nine
Terroristic coke, blowing on that dro
Nigga low key, no more
Bet I take your ho, till you show like a nigga ain't know
Home invade your door, express yourself like a lil bitch yo
I don't give a damn, nigga I go ham
Nah, I go hard as fuck, nigga you just outta luck
And take yourself, nigga tuck your chain
Fuck that shit, I'm bringing the pain ho
