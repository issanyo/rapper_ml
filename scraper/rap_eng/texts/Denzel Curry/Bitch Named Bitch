Bitch, that's a bitch named bitch
Got your bitch and my bitch
That's a bitch named bitch [X4]

[Verse 1: Denzel Curry]
I'm running down the fucking universe
In a purple vert, pink flame
Playing while a nigga diggin in her skirt
Switch it up, take her to the back
Like I do with her, splurging
Yeah girl I know you're not a virgin
So twerk it
After I work it baby you're worthless
Curses, but my dear I'm just blurring
Roses, just turned a nigga into Moses
Any given reason I open up in the ocean
I'm stroking, playing slow motion
Juvie, who me? All up in her head like a kufi
Ooh wee, Denny Cascade is a cool G
Realest nigga ever I meditate on mount Fuji
With a lady that resembles Lauryn Hill
Welcome to my world, the red and blue pill
Morpheus, really wanna know just what you're working with
We chop it up, we break it down
And then we never work again

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Yung Lean]
Root of all evil
Woke up in a Martin car, my chain look medieval
Leandoer, bitch, Iâ€™ll thrash her like a Weavile
Money in the needle, Glock empty, re-load we know
Drop-top in the whip fucking bad bitches
Seeball I'm the 5th beatle, talking is my detail
Yung Lean a young fetal, smoking loud in the cathedral
Half an ounce of lethal, half an ounce of peaceful
Glock to your head, pop goes the weasel
Half an ounce of lethal, half an ounce of peaceful
Glock to your head, pop goes the weasel
Dank got me flying over state, counting stacks is paper
Where my mind running circles, certain
Intoxicated, leave your luck to faith
No need to negotiate
Hide the dead bodies so we count the weight

[Hook]
