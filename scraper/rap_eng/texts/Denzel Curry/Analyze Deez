[Verse: Denzel Curry]
Ayy Nyyjerya, these boys inferior, black interior
Exterior only mirror the street I'm peering on
The street lights keep on reflecting just like my street life
The heat tight, I see the enemy, tell 'em keep right
I creeped up, thought you was hard, now you a seeker
Titty soft, it be a holocaust for the Häagen-Dazs
I want the cream, cheddar cheese and chettufine
The game is greedy, nigga I'm lookin' for linguine
Got two guns, two pacs, that's Afeni
I got my angels, my demons, omens, they never leave me
Don't believe me? I administer the minister
9 milli' is the finisher, death is your visitor
Told the driver that the time was now, so let's be ready
Bust it like confetti, leave a nigga noodle, no spaghetti
On the street, I let 'em know the SZN don't play, dog
Couple weeks later he was found with a stray dog—
Eatin' out his brain, left a couple remains
A couple of maggots on his chain with his face on the grain
See police they tried to figure out the motive or aim
Then they go back to the hood and try to figure a name
Where was who when the what happened?
Where was you, in the what caption?
Good cop but he's bad acting, bad cop but a good partner
One step got too close, two steps and you're back farther
Back to square one, honey got her hair done
At the salon with bitches talking 'bout Solange
I told her I'ma go undercover just like I'm Bond, James
Look for the shooter just like Lebron James
Had to be careful, I switch the hairdo
One false move and I'll be staring down the barrel
Three suspects dressed in all black apparel
They got on the scene, got away clean, so sterile
I got the analysis when I got a couple hints
The mastermind behind it all, he ruled with a iron fist
Address him as the Lord, a.k.a LoRd Lu C N
The brother on the side of him, he always has a grin
That's Zeltron but people call him 6 Billion
Switch like Chameleon, numerous affiliates
Put them both together now they look like Ferb and Phineas
This could be the people that be leading out the syndicate
African, name for a dame, Nyyjerya
The empress with the wickedness, cut your ligaments
No emphasis, so mysterious, only one missing is
Is the one who didn't take the Fifth* for making him a squid
