[Verse]
Going in like a SWAT team
You know me, that ULT
You like this, this my dream
You dont fuck with this or my fiends
Stand still got a gangster lean
He a sick nigga Charlie Sheen
The apocalypse happens now
So we flash screens like a movie scene
This Obscene
I dont drop trap like Travis
Crip niggas can't stand this
Im the only one who planned this
More hunger than Katniss
Im more lit than matches
Same Place in the Wrong Time
Im living with the madness
Dont panic from Magnums
I switch lives like Atlas
Cloud Nine like Denzel
One take no Practice
Need girls with fatness
Then I paint that canvass
This is my palace
So fuck off my campass
Shout out to Dahm and Projek
Nick Grace and Chrosky
Rappad that my hometeam
Everybody my homie
Everybody that know me
Know I dont play shit
Music is my life
So dont diss my creations

[Interlude]
ULT, follow me
Shout out to DC and that DC

[Outro]
In the night time, keep me out of sight, it's the poltergeist
When I'm ghost, I'mma cut the line, now you outta mind
Y'all niggas ain't U.L.T
Y'all niggas ain't U.L.T
Y'all niggas ain't U.L.T
Y'all niggas ain't U.L.T
