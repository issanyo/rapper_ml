[Intro: Aaron Rose]
It’s that ultimate Beast Coast shit
Ronny J, listen up

[Verse 1: Aaron Rose]
Hold up Corleone stepped in
With a brand new swank, no smoke section
But a nigga still lit
Got apes with a case for banana clips sitting by the money on the safe
But I will bless them, like I been sneezing
I’m sick with the lyrics, my season they season
Your season is food, beef I will cleave it
The love that they showing been broken like Cleveland
I went from a Wolf to a Cavalier
Now my name ring bells through the stratosphere
Over here where the Crips and the Bloods be
Be the place where the boy grew lovely
Now we off free Henny with the bubbly
But don’t touch that bottle my nigga trust me
That’s Patrón and I be blowin on strong
Cause a nigga still stressed cause real shit going on
Like why are my people dying?
Why are those bullets still flying?
They just killed my nigga Spazz
So I spazzed the flow like water Poseidon
To unslave your mind for real
I don’t do it for the money never do it for thrills
I really tryna put on for all my niggas who down
My niggas who would paint a nigga all red like clowns
My pack by the pound, they pack for the sound
Then I flip a verse, move swift through your town
Hit up Curry then it’s back to the Crowne
That something that we out finna take for the now
Or maybe 'til forever my nigga
Junior B said I gotta make it heaven my nigga
For my people that's with me, riding like shuttles
Carol City to the Borough we thorough

[Verse 2: Denzel Curry]
U to the L to the T for eternity
This is my brotherhood not a fraternity
Any emergency within an urgency
It’s going down choppers going up vertically
Copying governments we're never governing
Lead a rebellion that’s me and my covenant
Oh, man, I came out the boat from the ocean
They say that my people's the omen
Oh shit switch, ultimate is back
Two-don’t-know Cadillac, on the cul-de-sac
Bumping Project Pat, sipping Cognac
Cultivate the pack, one day might collapse
If you might relapse from the dopest raps
They don’t sit and crack, bitch
Guns might blow you off the atlas, shit

[Chorus: Denzel Curry]
Sometimes I can’t see
I just make my enemies bleed
Oh my God, I, I can’t breathe
My nemeses out, be forever ULT
But then again
Sometimes I can’t sleep
I can’t get you outta my dreams
Who am I?
I’m the unseen
That’s my reply
Just know you just know you always with me
Oh my God

[Break: Aaron Rose]
Yeah Nigga
Yeah we really out here
C9 to the Beast Coast
Carol City to Brooklyn
You feel me?

[Chorus: Denzel Curry]
Sometimes I can’t see
I just make my enemies bleed
Oh my God, I, I can’t breathe
My nemeses out, be forever ULT
But then again
Sometimes I can’t sleep
I can’t get you outta my dreams
Who am I?
I’m the unseen
That’s my reply
Just know you just know you always with me
Oh my God
