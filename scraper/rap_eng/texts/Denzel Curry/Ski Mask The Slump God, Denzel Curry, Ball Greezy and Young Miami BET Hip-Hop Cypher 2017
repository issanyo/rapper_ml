[Intro: Denzel Curry]
Dark side, you're now at the BET Cypher
And you know we all from south Florida, so let me introduce the crew
We got my dog Ball Greezy the legend
We got my dog Zoey Dollaz making dollaz
And we got my dog, put your face on Ski Mask The Slump God
And it's your boy Ultimate Denzel Curry
Aye yo, Premo drop that shit

[Verse 1: Ball Greezy]
Uh, I want a swag like Fab, crib like Ross
Paper like Jiggy and a hustle like Puff
Keep it street like Jeezy, label like Weezy
Talk more shit than Trick Daddy and Yeezy
Legend like Pac, and that nigga Biggie
Go from ashy to classy just like Nicki
Major key like Khaled, smoke like Snoop
Bang beats like Dre and make movies like Cube
Tour the world like Flo, neck like Slick Rick
With a fire ass album like 50 gon' get rich
Cool like Cab, bang like Jimmy
Smoove like Juelz, and freaky like Zekie
Nas with the knowledge, X with the pain
Ja Rule with the melodies and Drake when I sing
OutKast with the grammar, Geechie at it's finest
Cee Lo Green with the dungeon fam behind him
Ball Greezy, wide, yeah

[Verse 2: Zoey Dollaz]
Ayo, I'm bout to hit this beat raw, somebody get a Plan B
I'm so hot I made them move the cypher to Miami
After this your girl mouth about to be dumb like Donald Trump
Cause I'm on this screen spitting harder than Donald Duck
Last year, I was watching this on the TV
This year, hi hater, I know you see me
When I was ducking cops, swiping cards with no I.D
You was home bored, scrolling up on your IG uh
My future bright boy I see no error
I could've been like you, broke without a clue
But those c-notes better
A rap nigga touch me?
He know better
I be solo, but I'm 32 deep
My clip a ladder I make them bullets go climb up your cheeks
It's never about how you fall, it's always about the hand that catches ya
You can catch 3 to your head like you Chance the Rapper
Jay told me never go Eric Benet
I say never go Joe Budden, and lose a bad chick like Tahiry right on TV
Because fuck a rap beef, knowing they wanna meet me
Rappers, dancing like they Meechie
Louie shorts on jet skis, ooh I'm finna [?]
But I'll put some things on a yacht though
Never lose your cool over some thot hoe
.40 cal leave you with abajo
Yellow colored lambo, looking like it's a nacho
5 hour flight for your chick, to eat some tacos
This too easy I ain't have to go hard
Ima hold it down for Dade County and pass it to my dog

[Verse 3: Ski Mask The Slump God]
Ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy
This disgusting, like I just spilled some mustard
I'll turn my flow to Hush and Let It Burn
Like it's straight from Usher
Matter fact, I rode here on the back
Of a saber tooth white wild mountain cat
Double park in a spot for the handicap
'Cause if you can't tell I got a bad back but
It's a mayday, who gave this crazy a payday
And when she see my big wiggles
Made face like she stepped on Legos
God of War, like I'm Kratos, carnivore, I'm the prey though
I'm a whore, we a whore, we all whores, ayy!
Even if she hot I'm gonna drop her like potato
Told these niggas catch up like the sauce from a tomato
I see myself in Great White, you shrimp just like alfredo
And the way that I'm getting bread
Like I'm a jar of mayo

[Verse 4: Denzel Curry]
Better recognize, this the man ULT
Coming from the depths of that black land CC
Aquarius'killa the ultimate no Marvel or DC
You'll never be superman cuz I'm where the green be
Kryptonite
You say we blood until they lay you in the crypt tonight
Be careful or people that's around that ain't living right the
Left turn leave another brother chest burn
Bullets so hot they'll leave your homie's chest hair permed
Used to be on the block like H&R
Where the crackers chasing most of my niggas like an Atar
Raw, I'm Egyptian, nah I'm encryption, law
My depiction is a real nigga description bitch
You still hum capped off a niggas rims
Put some green on your head like I play The Sims
Say green because I've never been a flashy nigga
You see the world in black and white like a ashy nigga
