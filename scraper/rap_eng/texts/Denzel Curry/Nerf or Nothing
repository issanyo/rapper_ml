Nerf or nothing bitch
Nerf or nothing bitch
You know I never flinch, cause the clique never snitch
Nerf or nothing bitch
Nerf or nothing bitch
Nerf or nothing bitch
You know I'll never switch

Nerf or nothing bitch
Nerf or nothing bitch
You know I never flinch, cause the clique never snitch
Nerf or nothing bitch
Nerf or nothing bitch
Nerf or nothing bitch
You know I'll never switch

[Verse 1: KKTurbo]
Nerf is loyal, you know these hoes not
These hoes make you dizzy, as you smoke pot
With nerf you can shoot up a yacht
With nerf you can gather all the thots
One summer night, got in a nerf war
Down 8 boys run that defense back
Whipped out a rhino strike, took down a whore
Fuck you bitch my bars are whack
Fuck you bitch my bars are whack
I think I'm done selling crack
I'll send you a pack for a big mac
I'm carrying kids on my back
Even when spying you'll never see me lack
That's why they call me the leader of the pack
Leader of the pack, you know I eat ass
When it comes to ass, you know your ass is grass, bitch I'm about to mow it
That ass can't pass, when it comes to class you know I'll pass

Nerf or nothing bitch
Nerf or nothing bitch
You know I never flinch, cause the clique never snitch

You know I'll never switch

[Verse 2: KKTurbo]
I am the one, don't weigh a ton
Don't need a gun to get respect up on the street
Under the sun, the bastard son
Will pop the Glock to feed himself and family
By any means, your enemies my enemies
We wet them up like a canteen
The yellow tape surrounds the fate
Don't have a face so now you late, open the gates
