[Chorus: Lofty305]
(Yeah)
Yeah, (yeah)
Seldom do we share a room
Now that we to aspire [?]
Let's live and die
Live and die

(Yeah)
Seldom do we share a room
Now that we to aspire
Before we die
Don't fear the other side, girl

[Verse: 1: Lofty305]
Destined to be here with you
It goes like this, a cloudy mist
You were interesting, I was interested
And eventually, it turned into this
No more bitches with me
I'm solo now
I can't hurt no more
I'm too wavy right now
I'm gonna embrace the sky [?]
And my brain will never lie [?]
Memories never die
But you will, and so will I

[Chorus: Lofty305]
Seldom do we share a room
Now that we to aspire [?]
Let's live and die
Live and die

(Yeah)
Seldom do we share a room
Now that we to aspire
Before we die
Don't fear the other side, girl

[Verse 2: Denzel Curry]
Two more puffs
I'm gone with the wind
I am a ghost, off in the wind
Sometimes I think I might need therapist
Therapeutic, no I cannot compute it
Computadora, downloader loader
So I can get everything that I desire
Passion and fire
I can make anything happen my nigga
Just call me MacGyver

[Verse 3: Denzel Curry]
Call up G-O-V [?]
Where it stays on me
Mr. U-L-T, that's me
Whatcha wanna do
Whatcha wanna be, like
Just like a zombie I come back alive
I'm Frankenstein, out of my mind
Keepin' my vibes right
When my soul large, star, bright, bitch

[Chorus: Lofty305]
Seldom do we share a room
Now that we to aspire [?]
Let's live and die
Live and die

(Yeah)
Seldom do we share a room
Now that we to aspire
Before we die
Don't fear the other side, girl
