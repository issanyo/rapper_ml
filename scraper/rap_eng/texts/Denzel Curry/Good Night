[Hook: Denzel Curry]
Even if they hit me on sight
Everything gon be alright
Everybody have a good night
We gon make it to the daylight

[Verse 1: Denzel Curry]
It's ironic how it's crabs in the bucket but I'm coming from the sea
Snapping at me, the poetry
Dead on the street 'cause they lost in hate
Jit wanna get his stripes, eat some Frosted Flakes
Off to say communities we have no place
Even though the real victim is who caught the case
My Golden State all about the green, Draymond
Stay away from being a convict, Akon
Come to Carol City where the fun don't end
Till a nigga get to dumping like an ex-girlfriend
Stay in, bow your head we prayin'
For a bad bitch able to come on the weekend (uh!)
And if I said it I did it in pretense (uh!)
If you don't get it then please just pretend
I spied through my mahogany brown eyes
The sun will still rise, I thank the most high

[Bridge: Twelve'len]
The sun will keep on shining
(I'ma keep on shining)
The sun gon' keep on shining
Give love to the most high God

[Hook: Denzel Curry]
Even if they hit me on sight
Everything gon' be alright
Everybody have a good night
We gon' make it to the daylight
Even if they hit me on sight
Everything gon' be alright
Everybody have a good night
We gon' make it to the daylight

[Verse 2: Nell]
I can't even begin to explain the type of epidemics representing Carol City
Killing them little youngins really ill in these streets
We tryna make a way to put the foolishness to sleep
Keep mixing the antidote
No nonsense my mama metallic gold
Play my cards just cause it's harder come to recognize I got a clean slate
And finally getting to the point of feeling free-ee
Hovers my energy
Body scars put the pain in my heartbeat so I gotta drop heat
We touch the soul because we young niggas that gotta eat
They perpetrating promoting the shit they gotta reap
My family is the reason that I even speak
Every decent memory of people still be living shife
And you ain't really gotta die to lose your life
Think about it, it's a lot of niggas living outta sight
How bout you niggas ride the pipe as we reaching higher heights

[Bridge: Twelve'len]
The sun will keep on shining
(I'ma keep on shining)
The sun gon' keep on shining
Give love to the most high God

[Hook: Denzel Curry]
Even if they hit me on sight
Everything gon' be alright
Everybody have a good night
We gon make it to the daylight
Even if they hit me on sight
Everything gon' be alright
Everybody have a good night
We gon' make it to the daylight
