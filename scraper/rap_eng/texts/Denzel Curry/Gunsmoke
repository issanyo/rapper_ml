[Chorus: Twelve'Len]
Gunsmoke, gunsmoke
Gunsmoke, gunsmoke
Gunsmoke, gunsmoke
Gunsmoke, gunsmoke
Gunsmoke, gunsmoke
They don't wanna see us go
They don't wanna see us, grow
Stepping down on the edge
Stepping out on the ledge
They don't wanna see us there
They just wanna see us here

[Verse 1: Denzel Curry & Nell]
Call crazy comrade, catch us on the cover
Couldn't catch a anaconda, accumaliting the karma
Full off black missed a medal get fellon till I collapse cause I can't change the fact, so in fact I reenact
Read it back, reading in braille
Can Ray Charles see what he feel
I'm gassed up when I'm out of my chill
So he bringing them hell, I'm fresh out of jail
It's time to prevail gotta kill you niggas or my name isn't Nell
Denzel with the blues, bet they can't rely on Eli
12 get the A when they see I
And they know just what we do, still tryna end true real nigga
Try and cop a feel and send em to the cotton field
Everything light bright in my eyesight
There goes the neighborhood is just a way to say white flight
They hate at first sight, cause love will never treat em but a right life gotta give em light
But we live our right

[Bridge: J.K. The Reaper]
I know you don't understand
I done lost too many friends, I'm just hoping that you'll beam me up with you

[Verse 2: Denzel Curry]
All I see is the opposite plotting
Niggas get kilt like a skirt in Scotland
Who mad, crackers wanna box me in like plaid
But I got 'em spinning out of control, no Taz
Too many devils to deal with
Currently camouflaging the coat of chameleons
Blend, tricked by the Rumpelstiltskin
Saying I make all but tryna to take my ends
Real world one scene when I descend
Got a nigga crossed up like a quarter nick grin
I'm rock shit like ISIS, Isaac I'm Newton Huey when shooting, might as well recruit me

[Chorus: Twelve'Len]
Gunsmoke, gunsmoke
Gunsmoke, gunsmoke
They don't wanna see us go
They don't wanna see us, grow
Stepping down on the edge
Stepping out on the ledge
They don't wanna see us there
They just wanna see us here

[Verse 3: J.K. The Reaper]
Bodies on top of bodies they're always movin in silence
Cause'  I was runnin' at three in the mornin
Hopin' they don't find me
My words came under warning
You'll never see me in court bitch
It's hide n seek for every nigga in the street
Now errbody want a body
Errbody wanna beat it
Bigger bullet bustin' than anybody that got the heat
Errbody wanna talk, errbody wanna tweet
Why the pistol in the lining only hide it when the cops out
They were lookin' for a plea or a cop out
Droppin' bullets off inside a nigga Dropbox
Why they always tryna get into the hotspot
Niggas really lose minds, but not I
I done came from a place with a face every city never seen
But a jail cell popular
Just showin you what I see through my optical
This how a motherfucker sound when his options up

[Bridge: Twelve'Len]
I know you don't understand
I done lost too many friends, I'm just hoping that you'll beam me up with you

[Verse 4: Nell]
I done alot of wrong in my life, as I reflect on my inner thoughts I can see alot of wrong in my rights
I condone in the light
Cause the darkness within me tend to start
So I let the spark roam through the night
Cause I'm blind to the fact
A black man could barely survive an attack that the government's residents
Lash at his back
Stacks prove that the truth is bruisin
How people gotta act like they like it
But me, I could never wait
I must evolve with my fate
Fakeness dissolving the hate
This as real as it gets
Sinners get healed in the ditch
But life just goes on either way

[Chorus: Twelve'Len]
Gunsmoke, gunsmoke
Gunsmoke, gunsmoke
They don't wanna see us go
They don't wanna see us, grow
Stepping down on the edge
Stepping out on the ledge
They don't wanna see us there
They just wanna see us here
