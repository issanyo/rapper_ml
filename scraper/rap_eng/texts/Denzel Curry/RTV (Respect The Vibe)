[Verse 1: Nell]
Up in this thang, ready to pop
Dropping combos, with the slang, ah
Catching one to the brain
Better start fucking with the game, caught
38 hot, nigga don't cross you
Run up on the stain, leave him as just remains
Physical brain, havin' his mental up in flames
Kicking it lit with the same
Homies, only real niggas know me
Pull a .44 for the hood
Memories got me feelin lonely
We riding bottle, OG
Cold, as all of my niggas roll
Up, we blow, bust, its so tough
Any nigga run up, we go nuts
Cause we live behind the pistol
Raised in miami, grew up to know them
Them aren't the faux
Cause when niggas die they let it go
Let it rip, never be hesitant, hold that
Where the dome at, give 'em the flow
Reincarnation these niggas is old
Started off patient, then niggas went broke
But im on the gank, and a threat, any nigga ain't
'bout to try me, 'cept if I three
Take it to the head, I'm muhammaed ali
I bob and I weave, and bleed, put the cream
I'm that supreme, living in beamers
Y'all need me, we never believed
We could achieve, what life has to bring
Now get on my even, count my blessings
I learned my lessons, partial to convict
And I guess that reflects who I'm is
On a mission, I go the distance
I'm flowin' like Chris Columbus
Make your bitch come get this one wish
No rake, jake, or we chase
Smokin to the ? race

[Hook: Nell]
Only real niggas gon bump what we bump
See, how we come clean? What do you mean?
All we need is R.E.S.P.E.C.T
Nig, nigga what you mean my nigga?

[Verse 2: Denzel Curry]
This be the new millenium cause I'm controlling it
