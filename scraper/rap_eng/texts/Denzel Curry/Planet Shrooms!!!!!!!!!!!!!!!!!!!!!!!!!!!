[Verse 1: SUPA SORTAHUMAN X]
I don't give a fuck, trust me it's nothing
What give you the idea that we are bluffing?
Steadily grind, better be for something
Tryna keep good times in my circumference
Do whatever they may like I said it's nothing
No time for lying, no time for bluffing
[?] they're coming
[?]
Underground, that's what we're running
Sortahuman I ain't even playin' around
Earphones on my head, can't hear a sound
Except for the lyrics in my head
Plus the beat and how the speakers pound
R.I.P this universe, fuck this town
Feeling like an animal trapped in a pound
No matter how long we gon' howl
Still not sure if anybody hears a sound

[Verse 2: Denzel Curry]
Bring out the mask
And the Glock
And get rid of you
Pop! Pop!
Til' you drop
I drop it off yo ass fool
Villainous, villainy, killing them lyrically
[?], after me, niggas they fashion me
Killing the body, the nigga autopsy
Swift like a ninja, the nigga Akatsuki
Bring in a vet
Smoking these niggas like [?]

[Verse 3: Yung Simmie]
