[Intro: Kimbra]
I'ma goldfish in an ocean full of sharks
Like a push bike [?]
I wave my Moses stick and make the oceans part
You 'bout to learn a thing or two about me

[Pre-Chorus: Kimbra]
A porcupine with spikes
Gotta be careful it'll hurt your fingers
Would hurt a man and I
I know exactly what happened now
An angry dog might bite
If it bites you, you'll end up dead
There's a thunder storm and little Jimmy's got a kite

[Chorus: Kimbra]
And if you haven't seen all the things we can be
(You're about to see yeah)
And this bird has got wings and this goldfish can swim
(We're gonna be alright)
And if you haven't seen all the things we can be
(You're about to see yeah)
And this bird has got wings and this goldfish can swim
(We're gonna be alright)

[Verse 1: Kimbra]
I'm Optimus Prime there's more than meets the eye
I look like Jigglypuff before she sings
If you judge me that'll be my spinach I'll go Popeye
Your haters will be my Redbull, give me wings

[Pre-Chorus: Kimbra]
A porcupine with spikes
Gotta be careful it'll hurt your fingers
Would hurt a man and I
I know exactly what happened now
An angry dog might bite
If it bites you, you'll end up dead
There's a thunder storm and little Jimmy's got a kite

[Chorus: Kimbra]
And if you haven't seen all the things we can be
(You're about to see yeah)
And this bird has got wings and this goldfish can swim
(We're gonna be alright)
And if you haven't seen all the things we can be
(You're about to see yeah)
And this bird has got wings and this goldfish can swim
(We're gonna be alright)

[Verse 2: Denzel Curry]
Think about the past and my present will pass you
Life's a gift full a or's and if's
With a couple of maybe's a couple of babies
Who start complaining when they old and sh-
I can't do this, I can't do that
Need a new car and need a new hat
Couple of mouse traps to catch a few rats
Few of the new cats like where my dogs at?
I believe in me because of me so for eternity
I be the one that get the energy, you see?
I believe in you believing me so for eternity
I be the one that get the energy, to be
One of a kind, it's only unwinding
Inside your mind, there's only rewinding
Back to a time when the dream was so vivid
Thoughts of regret 'cause you know you coulda lived it

[Chorus: Kimbra]
And if you haven't seen all the things we can be
(You're about to see yeah)
And this bird has got wings and this goldfish can swim
(We're gonna be alright)
And if you haven't seen all the things we can be
(You're about to see yeah)
And this bird has got wings and this goldfish can swim
(We're gonna be alright)
