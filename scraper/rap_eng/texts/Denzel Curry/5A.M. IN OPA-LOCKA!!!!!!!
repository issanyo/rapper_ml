[Intro]
It's 4:55 in the morning and I'm tired as fuck in Opa-Locka
Yeah who is this guy?

[Verse: Denzel Curry]
Once again, it's the, Aquarius Killa
Ready to roll up a switch to kill a nigga with AK [?] quicker
Don't give a damn what you gotta say
I'm bumping nine millimeter infamous and Juicy J
On that three six tip bitch
You ready to die?
You ready to float?
You ready to fly?
You ready to burn?
You ready to fry?
I'm ready to kill
Live free and die hard
Curry spit the fire verses niggas calling him Charzard (smoke)
Now I'm not a pocket monster, I am a mobster
Leave you with the [?] with lobsters (get over here!)
Underground trill sound, I'm hot like hellbound curry is a dog
Take your next spell bound post for your team
I will kill you on the runway
Best, out of Carol CIty ever since gunplay, Rozay (get over here!)
But I'm the not the motherfucking police
5 A.M in Opa-Locka motherfucker, I'm too beast

[Hook]
5 A.M (5 A.M) motherfucker
5 A.M (5 A.M) motherfucker
5 A.M (5 A.M) motherfucker
5 A.M (5 A.M) motherfucker
5 A.M (5 A.M) motherfucker
5 A.M (5 A.M) motherfucker
5 A.M (5 A.M) motherfucker
5 A.M (5 A.M)
5 A.M nigga, 5 A.M in Opa-Locka bitch (pussy!)
(Smoke)
