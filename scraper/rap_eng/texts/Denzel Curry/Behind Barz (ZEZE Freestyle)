[Intro]
Link Up TV, Behind BarzD.A. got that dope

[Verse]
First off, every rapper in the game garbage
No flodgin', bitch I'm the Green Goblin
Bitch I'm always working hard, but I ain't Amish
All you silly little niggas need to pay homage
To a nigga like me, 'cause you ain't like me
And most likely, I'ma take your bitch
In some brand new Nikes, used to rock the Y-3
If you sponsored by me, then you are the shit
Big time player, big city roller
Came a long way from using Motorola
Pickled eggs, don't forget the juice, that cost a quarter
Tryna dodge the crackers when they try to reach their quota
Yeah, you already know what it is bitch
I light up an incense, 'cause nigga, I'm too lit
Don't give me your two cents, here's a penny for your thoughts
Put a penny in a pig, never pennies for a thot
Know what it is, know what it ain't, I'ma go back to the bank
Fuck a new car, in a new paint, I'ma pull up in a tank
Like drank never on me, and the dank never on me
If a nigga catch a fade
Then we paint with the homies like a mural
Fuck a federal bureau
It's plural, hella hoes and apparel
That's American, none of these hoes I'm marryin'
They only give a fuck 'bout what a nigga carryin'
Hmm, ha, I'm the new guy
Nigga better not try me, he might die
If a, nigga, pull up, I
Just might, have to, pull out, fire
No Nino but I make G money
Four kilo so I get ki' money
Hit C-Note so I see money
I go dumb but I ain't no dummy

[Chorus]
Pull up on a nigga, on God
Nigga never had to do fraud
Catch a nigga live with the squad
On that C shit, on that C shit
Pull up on a nigga, on God
Nigga never had to do fraud
Catch a nigga live with the squad
On that C shit, on that C shit

[Outro]
Carol City, nigga
And I'm out
