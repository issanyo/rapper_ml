[Verse 1: Gerard O'Connell]
I tried to keep these feelings in control
I've tried to find a reason not to show you
But every time I do, I give my all
I just can't let it go

[Pre-Chorus: Gerard O'Connell & Katie Taylor]
And even if you say, even if you say no
I'm gonna fight, babe
'Cause what I need has taken hold
And even if you play, even if you play dumb
It's not gonna change me

[Chorus: Gerard O'Connell & Katie Taylor]
If this is how real feels
Then I guess I want it
If this is how real feels
Then I guess I'm on it
If this is how real feels
Well it feels like falling
Yeah, I feel like falling
For you

[Verse 2: Gerard O'Connell & Katie Taylor]
I'm getting bored of artificial love
That one night feeling is never quite enough
There's evidence in each that we touch
That I'm not giving up

[Pre-Chorus: Gerard O'Connell & Katie Taylor]
And even if you say, even if you say no
I'm gonna fight, babe
'Cause what I need has taken hold
And even if you play, even if you play dumb
It's not gonna change me

[Chorus: Gerard O'Connell & Katie Taylor]
If this is how real feels
Then I guess I want it
If this is how real feels
Then I guess I'm on it
If this is how real feels
Well it feels like falling
Yeah, I feel like falling
For you

[Post-Chorus: Gerard O'Connell, Katie Taylor & Kweku Collins]
Yeah, I feel like falling
For you
Yeah, I feel like falling
For you
Yeah, I feel like falling
I feel like, I feel like, I feel like
Yeah, I feel like falling
Your love

[Verse 3: Kweku Collins]
Yeah, I feel like
I'mma miss the whole summer if I stay here
But that's kinda my intention, I admit it
Even if you say somethin' to the contrary
It's the things you don't say that I listen to
If this is how real feels
Well, I guess I'm with it
Compatible only in my eyes
Only there's no one reciprocating
So what to do my friend? What's the 411 really?
Yeah, not tryna cross me a line
But I'm falling and you know how that goes
When I pick up myself I hope it's you laughing at me
Tied all my laces and still you're the the dust on my jacket
My jacket, my bed falling flat, pow

[Chorus: Gerard O'Connell & Katie Taylor]
If this is how real feels
Then I guess I want it
If this is how real feels
Then I guess I'm on it
If this is how real feels
Well it feels like falling
Yeah, I feel like falling
For you

[Outro: Gerard O'Connell, Katie Taylor]
Yeah, I feel like falling
For you
Yeah, I feel like falling
For you
Yeah, I feel like falling
For you
Yeah, I feel like falling
