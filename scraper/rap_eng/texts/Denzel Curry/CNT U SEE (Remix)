[Hook]
Break me, slowly
For the one I share
Preaching slowly
But hands curled up tightly
My tears won't flow against her will
Oh won't you tell me please, how you can hear me?

[Verse 1: Wiki]
Told me gotta rap on it
Rat-a-scat on it
Skiddily doo-wop, do a dab on it
Low key when I nap on it, but now I'm back on it
Talking like a weatherman, calls it like we sees it
Be a better man, all about the season
Think I'm working for the pork, ain't had a choice but had a reason though
Seventeen, community service was my recess
Cause it's some BS (what?), Pops was hot
Called them senior kids, called them CS
As I regress, had to shed some fools and some defects, sharpen my reflex
Don't give a fuck about respect, I don't give a fuck I'm a reject, course I gotta eject
Did what the fuck you expected, my shit too electric, way I flow electrical
I picked up right where they left it, regrettable
So I left it and made next shit, acceptable?
Still not? What you hatin' on? They hangin' on my testicles
Gotta shake 'em off, fuckin' skepticals

[Hook: Jamie Isaac]
My tears won't flow against her will
Oh won't you tell me please, how you can hear me?

[Interlude: Denzel Curry]
Okay, okay, okay everybody, settle down, settle down
I go by the ultimate, Denzel Curry and this is a poem called 'what's the point?'

[Verse 2: Denzel Curry]
What's the point of living in the now if you can't see that your future is bright enough to blind the sun?
What's the point of being a star when people see you from afar yet you're constantly getting blocked by everyone
What's the point? It's worse than the way I feel when you just wanna hit
There's not a difference between musicians and women
Now I'm sending my apologies to the hearts I apprehended and the ones that ain't acknowledge me
Oh well, farewell, so gone, bittersweet
Only thing I want in life is love and my inner peace
Big house, nice lawn, and a hatchback
Twin flame living in my lap, who can match that?

[Hook]
Break me, slowly
For the one I share
Preaching slowly
But hands curled up tightly
