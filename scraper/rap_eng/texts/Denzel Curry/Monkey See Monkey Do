[Intro: Yoshi Thompkins & SDotBraddy]
Curry the killa' in my background
God damn (Move bitch!)
Shut the fuck up

Oh my god, Ronny

[Hook: Yoshi Thompkins]
Huh
Comin' out they call that bathin' ape(Call that shit bathin' ape)
Bitch I ain't rockin' no bathin' apes
I don't give a fuck about your bathin' ape
Savin' yo' ass like Amazing Grace
Tell that little nigga I've been an ape
Tell that little nigga he can't escape
Right now you fuckin' around with a great
Beat on my chest, call it bathin' ape

[Verse 1: Denzel Curry]
Hurricane Curry
I carry the 30
You niggas get buried
But not on Burberry
Y'all niggas too fairy
That's Cosmo and Wanda
I'm sharp as Katana inside a piranha
Dirty ass fez and I'm rockin' pajamas
And turn up the beat and a man like Juwanna
I need to pay homage, I always been honest
I'm Mr. Ebonics that created Phonics
Marvelous, stack up the cream like we Sonic
Created the team, all of my niggas right on it
Ultimate, stack up the cream like we Sonic
Two-timer, yeah it's dark and demonic
Curry out the car like no Death Row
Set it off, let it off, let go
Still on the block, no Lego
Enjoy my youth, no tests oh, my nigga

[Bridge: Yoshi Thompkins & SDotBraddy]
Huh
Comin' out they call that bathin' ape(Call that shit bathin' ape)
Bitch I ain't rockin' no bathin' ape(Put that shit down)
I don't give a fuck about your bathin' ape(Fire, fire, look, look)
Beat on my chest, call it bathin' ape

[Verse 2: SDotBraddy & Yoshi Thompkins]
My trap phone is my iPhone
Gettin' seven-digit dial tones
1-800-3825968, no I am not home
Leave a message at the beep
Fuck no, I don't wanna speak
I ain't spoke to yo' ass in weeks
Now that I think of it, come to years, look
Back when I was just a little jit
Black kid, nigga wit' the lip
Skinny jeans and a hat and a rip
No Ripstik did a kick flip
I am not the one to fuck with (Bitch!)
Security on that function (Bitch!)
All ready for the starship (Bitch!)
We both rage in the mosh pit (Bitch!)

[Verse 3: Yoshi Thompkins]
Bitch I'm too high to the top of the whip, we gone ride around the beat with no ceilings (Okay)
Not dreamin', I took me a dive on the deep end
I'm 'bout to go slay me a demon (Ha)
Demonic, U-Hauls of money
I put in that work and niggas gon' pay up
White like I'm Donny
Poppin' like I'm Berry
You pie, tell me what flava'
Talk to the animals, call up the apes
An' they gon' do me a favor
Ain't no tellin' what that monkey do
What that monkey see, that monkey do
Monkey da Yosh, I'm a monkey too
Might go ape shit if I look at you
Right at yo' ass like I'm Pikachu
In that tree is what you equal to, nigga

[Bridge: Yoshi Thompkins & SDotBraddy]
Huh
Comin' out they call that bathin' ape(Call that shit bathin' ape)
Bitch I ain't rockin' no bathin' apes(Put that shit down)
I don't give a fuck about your bathin' ape(Fire, fire, look, look)
Beat on my chest, call it bathin' ape

[Verse 4: Nell]
Told me go get 'em
I'ma go get 'em
Rell pull out the stick like the drum line rythm
Nigga let's go get 'em
Niggas zone side then ice
Fuck a fight
Boy, my niggas gon' slide like skates
Fake niggas droppin' like flies
Swagged up, when I'm down on the scene, it's on sight
Sweet cake niggas get Kimbo Slice'd up
Flight, when I'm flexin' don't get on 'em like Mike
Mike Epps, fuck hoes throw him on the mic
On the track like Adidas, 'cause I earned my stripes
Hoes act when I see 'em in the mall
Bend 'em, hit 'em from the back, in the mouth like Halls
Bitch I'm on the food chain, top and I won't fall
Came up 'cause I ball, Chris Paul, John Wall, Mike Vick
You a bitch
[?] the pics
Set it off, I'm a stick
You a 9, no clip
Headshots don't slip
Get lost

[Outro: Yoshi Thompkins & Nell]
Oh my God baby
Baby
