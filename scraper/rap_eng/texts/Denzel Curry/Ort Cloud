[Hook]
Girl you know that I
I wanna kick it with you
I can't, cuz' I, must grind
Girl you know that I
I wanna kick it with you
I can't, cuz' I, must grind

[Verse 1: Denzel Curry]
Sometimes I wish we were forever again
But then again
Sometimes I wish I'll never see you again
But then again
Sometimes I wish eternity would just end
But then again
Sometimes I wish I would just blow in the wind
And then
Fade like I watch her own close
[?] turn me into composed
Dirt, father fucks mother Earth
Worst, they put my brother in a hearse
Damn, heart can't relate
After the wait that my body awaits
Being you inside a physical state
Spirituality open the gate

[Hook]
Girl you know that I
I wanna kick it with you
I can't, cuz' I, must grind
Girl you know that I
I wanna kick it with you
I can't, cuz' I, must grind

[Verse 2]
It's not a [mayday?]
A [?] situation
Just for you
Wanna be close to you
All the time
You are on my mind
Do it like she want me to

[Hook]
Girl you know that I
I wanna kick it with you
I can't, cuz' I, must grind
Girl you know that I
I wanna kick it with you
I can't, cuz' I, must grind

[Verse 3]
I wanna kick it with you
But I got so much to do
I send my message to you
I'm flowing kisses to you
Bitch [?] living with you
I wanna listen to you
I wanna stick it in you
And then have some children with you
Sometimes, girl you know this is the truth
I got no issues with you
We doing what we should do
You grind, I grind
Someday I'll end up with you
When I got time
I'm tryna spend it with you

[Hook]
Girl you know that I
I wanna kick it with you
I can't, cuz' I, must grind
Girl you know that I
I wanna kick it with you
I can't, cuz' I, must grind
