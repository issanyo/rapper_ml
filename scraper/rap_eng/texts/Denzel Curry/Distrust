[Intro: Denzel Curry]
Careful who you hang around
They only want you for the (loot)
Claiming that they love you
But they'll have your ass in hot (pursuit)
Never turn your back 'cause
When they get the chance they gonna (shoot)
Catch you while you slippin'
Puttin' shots inside your (Subaru)

[Bridge: J.K. The Reaper]
I don't trust soul
I'm an outer body experience
My ligaments attached
To this soulless corpse I been living in
I'm riding, watching people plottin'
On they only benefit
I'm I the only human in truest form?
I've been heaven sent
It's evident my element
Is not meant to be mentioned
With these other motherfuckers that ain't
Never been through nothing

[Verse 1: Nell]
Fraud niggas been tryna get down
Revolve niggas for all figures
I'm puttin' you rappers back in that box
Up for delivery, who can you trust
When you chose the ops
Probably go off with the cop
'Cause niggas sittin' on the clock
I'm paranoid, more power, more problems
More thoughts to follow, my partner switchin'
But I'm wrong if I tell 'em to swallow hallow's
For stabbin' my back, based on betrayal
Beggin' for mercy, I've lost in the past
Have to prepare for controversy

[Verse 2: Denzel Curry]
I pull my liquor out so all my dead brothers could sip
Police tried to leave me headless with a sleepy hollow tip
Catch my drift, if you can't then I will sink your battleship
Here's a kiss from the dragon hot as the back of my spliff
I separate the hate so I could make the devil wait, ugh
Aviator, elevator only elevate, ugh
Scissor out my shell, I might as well should catch a case
When I'm looking at myself I only see my brother face
How the fuck, get my dollars up, bitch I never bluff
Fisticuffs, knock your ass out, that's Jigglypuff
I don't trust any informant that's forming inside my household
Another day, another dollar and another out sole
Bitches wanna check, niggas wanna see you sweat
Government want you in debt and these crackers want you dead
I can't even trust the tiniest voices that's in my head
So I only trust my gut instinct that's nuff said nigga

[Outro: Denzel Curry]
Tell the cops I don't give a fuck
Run and hide, boy you better duck
Tell the cops I don't give a fuck
Run and hide, boy you better duck
Tell the cops I don't give a fuck
Run and hide, boy you better duck
Tell the cops I don't give a fuck
Run and hide, boy you better duck
