[Chorus]
Finish 'em, Zel, finish 'em, Zel
I give 'em hell, won't wish 'em well
Finish 'em, Zel, finish 'em, Zel
I'm raising hell, send 'em to hell

[Verse 1]
Back and I'm dark and mysterious (yeah)
Laughing away 'til I do something serious
Attitude only imperious, rest all my enemies like I'm insidious
Inside I'm feeling so hideous (yeah)
Fuck everybody, I murder you idiots
I am a little perfidious, fuck a civilian, we're not equivalent (yeah)
I am a little delirious, suck my balls, -salmic (what?!)
Drop bombs, Islamic, flow so dead, sonic
I hear that life is a bitch, I hear that life is a beast (yeah)
Life is a freak on a leash, I am the mark of the beast (yuh)

[Chorus]
Finish 'em, Zel, finish 'em, Zel
I give 'em hell, won't wish 'em well
Finish 'em, Zel, finish 'em, Zel
I'm raising hell, send 'em to hell

[Verse 2]
Tortuously, killin' my infidels effortlessly
Want to impede, the P-O-P-E-D-E-A-D
Dead 'em, I do it professionally
Assassin's Creed, your majesty, the after is not happily
Her body in factories, my ugly life tragedy
I'm at yo face that's a Periscope, fuck a telescope
Careful my angel or higher hope, I desire rope, uh
I'm gonna live by my confidence, I'm gonna die by my arrogance
Heaven and hell is irrelevant, I be the black metal terrorist

[Chorus]
Finish 'em, Zel, finish 'em, Zel
I give 'em hell, won't wish 'em well
Finish 'em, Zel, finish 'em, Zel
I'm raising hell, send 'em to hell
Jackal in a jack mood
Finish 'em, Zel, finish 'em, Zel
Everything that I see will be taboo
I give 'em hell, won't wish 'em well
In a bad mood, but I'm back too
Finish 'em, Zel, finish 'em, Zel
Everything that I see will be taboo
I'm raising hell-
(SEND THEM TO HELL)

[Outro]
I be the black metal terrorist
I be the black metal terrorist
Send 'em to hell
