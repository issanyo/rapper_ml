Mmmm, yeah, yeah

[Chorus]
Welcome to the darker side of TA13OO
All I've got is permanent scars and tattoos
Take another step in the path that you choose
Make a bad choice in your path then you lose
Welcome to the darker side of TA13OO
All I've got is permanent scars and tattoos
Take another step in your path that you choose
Make a bad choice in your path then you lose

[Bridge]
Ohhhh (oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
Ohhhh ohhh (oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
Ohh, ohh
Ohhhh, ohhhh
Ohhhh (oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
Ohh, ohhhh (ahhhh)

[Verse]
Gorgeous beautiful taboo, always with a lot on her mind
You giving me all of your stories in the littlest amount of time
You loving me is forbidden, loving you back is a crime
I wrote this poem for you, forever remain in my rhymes
I knew you wasn't normal ever since the age of nine
I, heard you were molested when you hit the age of five
So, in a sense I sensed that all your innocence had died
You, swallowing all of your pride, won't, let anybody inside
As you cry me a thousand lakes on my shoulder blade, I say
Everything's gonna be okay
I'ma hold tight 'til I see the next day with you
Stay with you, play with you, pray with you and pray to you
Curry killed the pussy hoping that I could kill the hate in you
Even if you don't wait for me, forever I will wait for you
Even if it's too late for me, forever I will wait for you
Watching your destiny fold in the grip of my palms
Paper planes being thrown on the side of the lawn, it said

[Chorus]
Welcome to the darker side of TA13OO
All I've got is permanent scars and tattoos
Take another step in the path that you choose
Make a bad choice in your path then you lose
Welcome to the darker side of TA13OO
All I've got is permanent scars and tattoos
Take another step in your path that you choose
Make a bad choice in your path then you lose

[Outro]
Ohhhh, ohhhh
Ohhhh, ohh
