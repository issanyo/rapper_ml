[Hook]
It's like my world is reversing
Even the pain couldn't hurt me now
Rewind the good to the worst things
Even my love has deserted me now
I cannot love 'cause it hurts me
I will be happy when I see the sun drown
I have transformed to the worst me
Infinite words couldn't curse me now

[Verse 1]
Everything is backwards mother's saying that I'm sinning
Close my eyes and say "forgive me"
'Cause I know the devil ain't
Devil told my mother in the end that he'll be winning
'Cause the world is full of sinning
No your son is not a saint
Spirit of God and the holy ghost it was written in anecdotes
That a snake would try to corrupt what he create
Sick of facades and the horoscope I devour the antidote
Told my mother that I was spirited away
Monstrosity murdering masterpieces, I'm mutilated
Falling forever, fear and forsaken, incinerated
Innocence inferno when I'm no longer incubated
Welcome to the world whenever I'm reincarnated
Relying on the last breath, but y'all would never know
Rewind it to the last step, play me when I'm below
If heaven's set on fire that's the day they make hell snow
The devil want my soul and yet I'm telling him "hell no"
It's still like this...

[Hook]
It's like my world is reversing
Even the pain couldn't hurt me now
Rewind the good to the worst things
Even my love has deserted me now
I cannot love 'cause it hurts me
I will be happy when I see the sun drown
I have transformed to the worst me
Infinite words couldn't curse me now

[Verse 2]
Everything is backwards ever since the new beginning
God has given me the vision so that I can see my fate
Blind can't lead the blind and if we try then we'll be spinning
In a cycle in position trying to find a better place
Lucifer, devil, the anti-christ taking light up out of my life
In the darkness, it seems to me there's no escape
Initially alter it into dark, place the pain inside of a pot
And then bury it in a spot where I decay
It's  death before dishonor I'm a hideous disfigurement
Who's dying from the envious evil trapped in Floridians
Came from the Vatican, kill off the advocate
Feeling inadequate, when a bitch nigga bleed
Won't even make it to see 23, yeah, fuck it I don't wanna be
Here, look at the time when I'm turning it back
On the clock and  my right hand making it tick
Life is a bitch, better yet it's a pit
And my hatred is everyday making you sick
Regurgitated, early stages, earn the hatred
Burn the sages, caught in mazes
Instigated, inspiration, imitations
Only here, reanimated, damn!

[Hook]
It's like my world is reversing
Even the pain couldn't hurt me now
Rewind the good to the worst things
Even my love has deserted me now
I cannot love 'cause it hurts me
I will be happy when I see the sun drown
I have transformed to the worst me
Infinite words couldn't curse me now
It's like my world is reversing
Even the pain couldn't hurt me now
Rewind the good to the worst things
Even my love has deserted me now
I cannot love 'cause it hurts me
I will be happy when I see the sun drown
I have transformed to the worst me
Infinite words couldn't curse me now
