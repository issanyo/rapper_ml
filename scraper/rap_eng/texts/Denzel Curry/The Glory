[Verse 1: Erick Arc Elliott]
You see us as winners, when do we ever win?
When am I even good enough? Acknowledge your friends
Sometimes things get broken and we argue again
Spent the last 20 minutes all inside of my head
I'll explain it as takin' cash on culture from the poachers
Scopin' everything I have, ignorin' all the bullshit that made me mad
Killin' coral reefs, smoking weed too fast
Almost got skipped, bitch I read too fast, I don't bleach my past
These are the titles G's supposed to have, cold in the summer
Sweatin' bullets out on Flatbush Ave
Spirit like I got a platinum plaque, modern acrobat, the mass effect
I sharp shoot 'em, make them tap the mat, so accurate
We represent the illest seniors, small demeaners
Tellin' lies inside this room of cheaters
Even at the stage of a fetus, I reclaim to repeat this to all my demons
That's pigeon-holin' your genius and feedin' right into weakness
How can he write his thesis? He don't believe in Jesus
Sweetness, I'm almost speechless, for our future, egregious
We gotta pick up the pieces shawty, I'm familiar with pain
Used to play by myself when they considered it lame
Do this thing by yourself, nothing is ever obtained
Introverted but I’m emergin' the spark to the flames
I won't harp on a thing
I won't causin' the blame, but it's hard to obtain

[Chorus: Erick Arc Elliott]
I wanna see you winnin', I wanna see you get the cash
Wanna see you finish, don't wanna see you wave the flag
Wanna see you try hard, wanna see you do it big
Bringing champagne home, 'long as I could get a swig
I wanna see you winnin', I wanna see you get the cash
Wanna see you finish, don't wanna see you wave the flag
Wanna see you try hard, wanna see you do it big
Bringing champagne home, 'long as I could get a swig

[Verse 2: Meechy Darko]
A real friend'll kill you if you asked him to
Instead of stabbing on the back of you
Just trying to get ahead
But you can't spend a dime if you work yourself dead
We are so deep in love with the sinner but not the sin
How could she turn my king size into a waterbed? Damn, I'm just sayin'
Kick her out the crib and scream, "Baby, come back"
Then kick her out again—I'm just crazy like that
Bitches fall in love with a nigga out of his mind
And I fall so deep into lust with a chick with a big behind
My ex left cause I ain't got no hits
I heard her new boyfriend lumpin' her up with his fists
But hey, you got what you asked for, I'm petty as shit
That's some food for thought, I let you do the dishes

[Chorus: Erick Arc Elliott]
I wanna see you winnin', I wanna see you get the cash
Wanna see you finish, don't wanna see you wave the flag
Wanna see you try hard, wanna see you do it big
Bringing champagne home, 'long as I could get a swig

[Verse 3: Denzel Curry]
I'm Faizon with no love, give love with a golden glove
I'm the man with a golden gun, black man under golden sun
I'm shinin', Jack Nicholson, wishes where my nickels went
Kisses on my mistletoes, did I have a Christmas? No
But I had a misses though, believe me, shoulda vacay'd in Tahiti
Wishing you were dyin' with me, sweet as hugs and diabetes
Leave me, love me, touch me, cut me, lustin'
Fuck me, busty, dusty, old and rusted
Baby, do you mind if I revise what's in your mind?
You see my call declined because a certain point in time
I'm hopin' every line it hits like millimeter nine
You beggin' me to change, that is a penny to a dime
The realness in my spirit always gets you every time
Optimistic like Optimus, we ain't even reached our prime
Roses are red and violence leads to violins
End of discussion, I hope that we could still be friends

[Verse 4: Zombie Juice]
Don't take this shit for granted, I'm blessed just like my granny
Shout out my Uncle Mannie, hey, hi, I hope you winnin'
Gia, I hope you listenin'
And Tommy hold your head, man fuck your heart condition
Rihanna like my big momma, we call Penny Big Momma
She like a hundred years old, that's a real old timer
Uncle Karl you in a better place
Just know the pictures that you took gon' live forever and a motherfuckin' day
Rest in peace Uncle Rob, we miss you, bless your heart
Rihanna and my grandmomma took me in from the start
Aunt Marie beatin' cancer, givin' everything she had
My cousin Calvin showed me swag, my cousin Hebrew showed me straps
Me and J used to hustle, he had that white, I had that green
Who got them pills? We in Fort Greene, lil niggas on the scene
God had four knives, that's one for each pocket
Gonna need nine lives if you get outta pocket
If I see cousin James, I'll knock his eye out his socket
Diamante hold me down like I ain't got a wallet
Rest in peace to my sweet great-grandma Grace
I wish my momma was alive, if I could see her face
My grandfather used to say when I fucked up
That I was just like my momma, tough love
I wish I could see my kid way more than I could
My baby momma holdin' grudges but the court will do good
