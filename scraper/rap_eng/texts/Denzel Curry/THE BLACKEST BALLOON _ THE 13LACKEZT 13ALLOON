[Chorus]
Ooh, ooh, feel like a horror movie
Ooh, ooh, why my brother callin' to me?
Ooh, ooh, acting like I never knew me
Ooh, ooh, put that on my brother Mookie
Ooh, ooh, feel like a horror movie
Ooh, ooh, why my brother callin' to me?
Ooh, ooh, acting like I never knew me
Ooh, ooh, put that on my brother Mookie

[Verse 1]
Put that on the gang, wait, put that on my name, wait
Put that on my mama, put that on my first chain, wait
Say I'm not the same, who said that my face changed? (wait)
You thought I was lame but I made a lane (damn straight)
All truth, no dare, these hoes don't care
They'll leave you passed out in your underwear
Leave me in the cold but you'll never take my soul, bitch
Curry's still that nigga with a mouth full of gold, bitch

[Chorus]
Ooh, ooh, feel like a horror movie
Ooh, ooh, why my brother callin' to me?
Ooh, ooh, acting like I never knew me
Ooh, ooh, put that on my brother Mookie
Ooh, ooh, feel like a horror movie
Ooh, ooh, why my brother callin' to me?
Ooh, ooh, acting like I never knew me
Ooh, ooh, put that on my brother Mookie

[Verse 2]
Watchin' me and watchin' you is like some on demand shit
Niggas want the clout so they can buy a fuckin' mansion
Niggas on them percs and might just shoot a fucking campus
Everybody and they mama tweakin' on that Xan shit
Shit is messed up, pills be on the dresser, uh
Buddha bless ya, give instructor X some, uh
Look at my eyes, let the beat ride
Ain't shit changed since Lil Peep died
On the Southside, it's suicide, in a box with a suit and tie

[Chorus: Denzel Curry and Soulja Mook]
Ooh, ooh, feel like a horror movie
Ooh, ooh, why my brother callin' to me?
Ooh, ooh, acting like I never knew me
Ooh, ooh, put that on my brother Mookie
Ooh, ooh, feel like a horror movie
Ooh, ooh, why my brother callin' to me?
Ooh, ooh, acting like I never knew me
Ooh, ooh, put that on my brother Mookie

[Outro: Soulja Mook]
Man y'all niggas ain't shit man
Man y'all niggas rockin' shit man
Bring it back round this shit man, 2K
KRS genius style king of violence type shit with that shit man we back
Fuck you mean, I'm too high for this shit let me calm down
In this bitch all maxed out
Full power, full spirit, full body release, we ain't playing no more
You niggas ain't got 2K lens unless we let you in
Unless we open the door, so don't let it close on you
Haha
