(Lofty 305)

See it's, Lofty 3-0-5 That's me ho
When it comes to your bitch, I'll Be the bandito
The bandit, Yeah the bitch, she could never manage
She can't stand it, So I told her just sit on the dick
And then I told her to rub her clit on the tip
And then I told her that a nigga is the shit
So she better give me grip and if not
She better give me twat , then she got to walk
Back to the bus stop, take it home, take it home
And Lofty 305 get the dome from the shome
Her name is Lisa, wait, I think it's Lauren
I forgot her name that bitch pussy was too borin'
And Lofty 305 just chillin' and im tourin'
And these hoes steady slorin and what we in it for
Not the fame or the fuckin money, why you think im blunted
Just to have a discussion with some fuck niggas, Naw
