[Verse 1: Yung Simmie]
I be off this herb
Puffing on the purp
Never smoking dirt
Now your feelings hurt
Why you watching me he gon' hit you first
Soul gon' touch the sky, bodies in the dirt
I'ma serve you up, you gon' get the work
The last nigga that tried me he got it first
Smoking on mars, I'm off this earth
I kill him with bars, leave beast in the Hearse
Money I'ma stack it
I'm all black it
Never am I lacking
Wavy like a captain
Came to get it cracking
Been about the action
We can make it happen
Nigga what it is
I been going hard for a million years
Never shed a tear flier than a Lear
Me myself and I, three musketeers
Smoking on loud I can't even hear
All you see is smoke then I dissapear
It's your worst day, but this been my year
Now I'm taking over I'm in fifth gear
I'm smoking on rover
Your rap days are over
This ain't your session you better move over
I swerve in the Rover
Mix Henny with Cola
Puff on that doja
I stand in my corner
Ain't pay a dolla I came with the owner
Now you looking salty
You thought that you saw me
I'm balling like Barkley
My weed lit like Barkley
Get yo main lady
She all on top of me
Getting real money you playing Monopoly
It ain't no stopping me
It ain't no dropping me
Get hella high then I laugh like it's comedy
This ain't no Twitter, I made yo bitch follow me
Later that night, it was yo bitch toppin' me

[Verse 2: Denzel Curry]
Captain of the sea
Intergalactically
I'm a catastrophe
With no gravity
Can't flow after me
Smokin' on the tree
Pass the Grabba Leaf
Roll the Grabba Leaf
Grab the Mac and squeeze for my mac n cheese
Niggas and bitches, oh why you actin' like dog to eat [?]
I am magnifique, magnificent
Just like Eminem
My style infinite
My weed chiefing
My dro blazing
My bitch bad, my flow amazing
Tryna comprehend
Like going through mazes
Don't try to flex 'cause my brother's crazy
Put that on motto
I lead and you follow
So check my bravado
I'm smashin' movato
Money the same color as avocado
You never had bitches
You're Johnny Bravo
Why pretend to be
Try befriendin' me
Pulling out the AR
Son [?] of my enemies
Frenemies, you never been my friend
I been to places you never been my friend
Fuck with me that's yo end my friend
I need money I need m's my friend
Goddamn, yeah I been everywhere
Overseas, over the world I don't give a fuck
Fuck that (I need money!)
