[Hook]
Tell me what you niggas know bout niggas like me
Rollin' K.O.D. while on LSD
Tell me what ya'll niggas know bout niggas like me
Rollin' K.O.D. while on LSD
I'm fried, I'm in my zone
I got that kush, I got Patron
I got that weed, and LSD
And your bitch just popped a molly
I'm fried, I'm in my zone
I got that kush, I got Patron
I got that weed, and LSD
And your bitch just popped a molly

[Verse]
I be the universe gangster, runnin' through your damn block
Click, clack, poppin', that's the sound of the grey matter Glock
So I be Aquarius killa, that nigga guerrilla when runnin' up
Alaska in my heart so who gon' tell me that I give a fuck
Or what Goddess that I'm smashin' when I leave the club
Angel, soarin' through the dancefloor like a kokita
God damn, really when the mother nature got us up in my galaxy
Lavishly, livin' in the mansion where we play Grey's Anatomy
Doctor, I am so proper, look at the posture
I'll cross her, and finally caught her but then I lost her
Found her, a close encounter, over-the-counter
I bounce her, I wouldn't play her cause I'm not Bowser
Arouse her, gave her a heart, drop dollars and browsers
Amped up, I think we stamped up, she's in my trousers
Wowsers, she's at the tower, peek in the shower
The flowers become the power within the hour
Cowards, spaces to outer, green as the outer
Glow, after I'm stickin' my dick in this ho, beggin' for mo', woah
Woah, slow down, she thought I was destroyin' her
She likes the way it feels when she's searchin' for euphoria

[Bridge]
Euphoria, euphoria, I'm glidin' through South Florida
On acid tabs, shawty with a chick that look like Gloria
Estefan back in 1985
Shake that ass just like a conga when you get a nigga high
Euphoria, euphoria, I'm glidin' through South Florida
On acid tabs, shawty with a chick that look like Gloria
Estefan back in 1985
Shake that ass just like a conga when you get a nigga high
Euphoria, euphoria, I'm glidin' through South Florida
On acid tabs, shawty with a chick that look like Gloria
Estefan back in 1985
Shake that ass just like a conga when you get a nigga high
Euphoria, euphoria, I'm glidin' through South Florida
On acid tabs, shawty with a chick that look like Gloria
Estefan back in 1985
Shake that ass just like a conga when you get a nigga high
