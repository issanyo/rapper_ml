[Intro]
Well it's that
Well it's that
Well it's that
Well it's that
Uhm

[Verse 1: JK The Reaper]
Well it's that straight rap
I would kill to dress like I was dressed to kill
Fuck that though
Either way it go I'ma be the illest person here
Them hoes just like their hair
Yeah you bought it but still it was never real
Whispered in my ear
All that cliched shit I want to hear
Yeah-yeah
Make that ho say, yeah
Kill that pussy and tat a tear
Cause I'm a walking chandelier
Turn your hood into a title match, tables, ladders, chairs
I was gone, never there
I'm a myth
Fuckin' a genie, make a wish
Switch flip
On these normal motherfuckers that be thinkin' inside of the box
Pussy talked and pussy walked, it'll be running back to me
Reel 'em in them then I send 'em back to sea
If you miss then send 'em back to see
If plan A don't work then back to C
Bag the weed and bring a black for me
And if it's blasphemy then my niggas gon' blast for me, ay
The weed we smoke so good I wouldn't ever wanna rap about it
Sex so good she don't ever wanna live without me, girl I doubt it
You was sayin' that same shit about that nigga that I stole you from
Call her ex-boyfriend like "thanks bruh I owe you one" haha

[Hook]
High heels, she would kill to dress like she was dressed to kill
Birkin bag, she would kill to dress like she was dressed to kill
Jeremy Scott, she would kill to dress like she was dressed to kill
Louis Vuitton, yeah she suck my, I still won't pay the bills
High heels, she would kill to dress like she was dressed to kill
Birkin bag, she would kill to dress like she was dressed to kill
Jeremy Scott, she would kill to dress like she was dressed to kill
Louis Vuitton, yeah she suck my, I still won't pay the bills

[Verse 2: Denzel Curry]
This type of game do not come with tutorials
You can exit if I'm boring you
Before the memorial
Hit up the oracle to receive orders from me to you
Get the message, you and I are destined
If you interested then you learn a lesson
Got connections then we get to stepping
Second you undressing, then it's armageddon
When explodin', explorin' the foreign
In orbit all the way from the surface
Never nervous
Drugs'll kill me but I got a purpose, do not leave it there
Stick it in your head like you seen a fed
Slow the flashin' lights
Knew certain things get you actin' right
And I love it when you don't be actin' nice
Let me get you right
It's K-O-T-M-S
2055 and I still don't take kindly to threats
Nigga I never had swag, all I had was the beads on my neck
Got a lot of check and a lil blue check but I don't eat checkers
That nigga got real high standards
Only bad bitches but no prima donnas
I hit from the sun down to Easter Manana
Senorita thought my dick was a quesadilla
So I told her to feed her
Gettin' head while I'm switchin' from Anita
Turn up Aaliyah to make sure the mood right
Red bone same color, Dudley Do-Right
Messy ass jits on her face like a food fight
Zip up my pants then I'm out when I take flight
Knock it out the park like my nigga can't get right

[Hook]
High heels, she would kill to dress like she was dressed to kill
Birkin bag, she would kill to dress like she was dressed to kill
Jeremy Scott, she would kill to dress like she was dressed to kill
Louis Vuitton, yeah she suck my, I still won't pay the bills
High heels, she would kill to dress like she was dressed to kill
Birkin bag, she would kill to dress like she was dressed to kill
Jeremy Scott, she would kill to dress like she was dressed to kill
Louis Vuitton, yeah she suck my, I still won't pay the bills

[Verse 3: JK The Reaper]
Trendy thots, they would kill to dress like they were dressed to kill
We don't give a fuck so please don't stress no fuckin' fashions over here
You extra queer, can't even straight out when you look at me nigga
And that's why your bitch gone
Pull a Houdini, you askin' who seen her, kid with my demeanor
I feel like Vegeta, can't no one defeat me
Plottin' on pullin' bad hoes we with the actin' like they in the scene
Be causin' a scene
But we'll never get awards for it
That pussy be world tourin'
So how the fuck you still local?
You should be open
Come in this pink room and I help you get noticed, ay
And I help you get noticed, ay
