[Chorus]
Envious
Everyone actin' so frivolous
Jealousy
I can read it with telepathy
You making me sick
You making me sick
I might run up on a nigga and
Click

Run up on a nigga and Click
Run up on a nigga and Click
Run up on a nigga and Click

[Verse 1]
It is the ultimate Myrmidon
From the land, which is the city of Babylon
Dreads in my hairs, donâ€™t confuse me for Cinnamon
I'm one of a kind, as I grow like a Digimon
When I'm evolving, not many books
Many revolvers, no problem solving
Illegal tendencies, infinite symphonies
Illustrate misery, living on infamy
Infamous Lord
If you come back from the dead, you will go back to the morgue
I'll hunt you like senzu, so better be humble
Don't make me, I'm Wesley in the Art of War
Soar, sin and then you will be flying
Truth, ad hominem, I won't be lying
Bruh, ain't no hakuna matata
'Cuz, you shouldn't fuck with a lion

[Chorus]
Envious
Everyone actin' so frivolous
Jealousy
I can read it with telepathy
You making me sick
You making me sick
I might run up on a nigga and
Run up

Run up on a nigga and
Run up on a nigga and
Click

[Verse 2]
It is the ultimate test
Strategize now, it's the ultimate flex
So I'm doing my thing without breaking a sweat
Got a list full of names and I'm all about checks
Like an assassin, I'm everlasting
Go like a gadget, you can imagine
When I get rachet, Clank on me
Thankfully
Ain't no containing me, comparing me
Vision impaired, you should prepare to die
Never been scared to try
I got the feel of a burning sensation
My nation believe I can walk on the sky
Anakin, analyst, and highly dangerous
Must be an alien, that pray to amethyst
My style is cancerous, up in the cannabis
ULT anarchist
Oh

[Chorus]
Envious
Everyone actin' so frivolous
Jealousy
I can read it with telepathy
You making me sick
You making me sick
I might run up on a nigga and
