[Verse: Denzel Curry]
I pour my liquor upon the concrete for the fallen niggas that were murdered in the 13
Gotta keep a hammer in case a nigga wanna case me
Long live Tiarra, baby girl was only 18
Victim from a stick drill
Bullets hot and this shit real
Niggas wanna talk who trill brah? Who the livest?
Motherfuckers on that Pac shit
Nigga fuck the world like a side bitch
Mackaveli vibin'
Flippin' blunts like a psychic
Betcha them boys still ridin'
Murder gardens is lookin' like Gotham
Bitch I stunt in all black like I'm Gothic
Got 30 in a clip run your pockets
Shit want everything in ya wallet
From 3-7 hit a 2-0-7
Candy lady servin tryna make a profit
Got, nickel and diming we rollin' and lightin'
Talkin' that lick on a spliff
Grab all these packages smoke with the African's
Getting real high off the piff
Run at me money crook little boy what in the fuck could I say
These crackers don't know about what a nigga shooting now
That's communicating with a K
Problems get solved and resolved so they spray
Channel 7 news they caught PJ's killer
Look at the screen like "Oh My God"
Daddy looky-look bro we know this nigga
What the fuck or so it seems
Like Piccolo nigga how you do a nigga green
Go to the club but it ain't 54'
Posted up with a shone now we speakin' on the beat
Chill with Ciara and the niggas from the scene
Who would of thought she would of ended in a Benz
Life's fucked up for the poor young teen
As she got hit up with about 17
Shots from the dark, let her feel from the park
Better note these games and don't be smart
Better learn get, if you don't learn get, then you more liable' to get got
3-2 Z-E-L, piss off no R.Kel's
Bitch I'm from the place where all the palm trees and the AK's dwell
Times is hard but I know things gon' get better nigga
Carol City chief fuccboi I'mma chief forever nigga

[Hook]
Carol, Carol City I'ma chief forever, nigga
Roll my, roll my weed and I'mma chief forever, nigga
Talking pressure niggas bout whatever, nigga
You fuck around and leave you on a stretcher, nigga
Carol, Carol City I'ma chief forever, nigga
Roll my, roll my weed and I'mma chief forever, nigga
Talking pressure niggas bout whatever, nigga
You fuck around and leave you on a stretcher, nigga
