[Mike Dece] Verse 1
I feel so stoned, disconnected and attracted to you
Cause the money and power and respect has my mental on another connection except when you skepic, consenting to step into my section
My piss is a blessing to me like a reverend I bless you with bullets
For thinking bout checking in love with my weapon no voice can contest I spit you like liquids I'm leaving you bitches
I have no remorse
I'll take your life like they took mine when I was born
I had no choice I had to move it off the porch I had to get rich
I split you up like it's the divorce
I'm killing you all these clips peel you off like leaves in the fall just want marijuana and money that's all I'm gettin' rich in this bitch like the song I'm married to money these hoes can fuck off and I'm still doing all the same shit but I"m just trying to gettin" rich up this bitch

[Denzel Curry] Verse 2
Hit me on the 786
Do you really wanna fix
Like a plumber
Its a bummer
If I pull up in a hummer
But you thought I had a honda
So I turned it to a hummer
I don't really give a shit unless you talk about a hundred bands
A hundred grand
Curry keep the path like stunna man
I can be the motherfucking son of sam
Curry is the killa
Fuck around and we might kill them man
Another man dead from the rapper the ultimate
Ultimatum
Join and slay them
Life is pointless so i erase them
From the pencil to the pistol
So I'm pissed now
Bout to flip out and hit natta with the Krysal
Oh wow, what it is I do now
Gold slugs in my grill like jewel town
Niggas see the goons now
Clear the fucking room out
Fake ass niggas shouldn't belong in tool town


[Hook]
? I wonder if I'll ever get out this ?
?
Two middle fingers up i'm screaming fuck that
I'm all about my cheque, these niggas snitching like a rat
I'm back in the trap trying to hit a lick
I don't give a fuck i'm trying to live off
Gettin rich up in this x 3

[SDot Brady] Verse 3
Look i knew i was the man back in highschool
Tried to them niggas but they walk right by you
Not everybody wanted to be part of my game
But you niggas better get to cripping cause we the pyru
You know you are not b l double o d, fuck that or my family
And its not a black thing or a white thing but ?
Shroomin with Anton you know how we rockin remindin me i feel like a cool kid
Little kids next door you know the code names C9 I'm gonna put you on some luke shit
Fucking without money how to fuck with a nigga build up his networth
Cause it's my money and I need it now now now now now no JG Wentworth

[Caleb Stone] Verse 4
Black out drunk and i hiccup
Two bad hoes in my pickup
My dogs sick em
You looking like a leg but i've never been a victim
And i put them on a stroll when i pimp them
Jigga
I'm hot
With the money on the green dot
Livin by the g code
Feelin on the g spot
I just put a couple hundred on my brothers books
I just spent a coule bands on some stripper puss
She don't even wanna know my name
She wanna love me like Novacaine
I don't even wanna cure the pain
I just wanna run the coldest game
So she gave me the payment
I gave her the placement
Spread the legs open
Exploring her basement
Straight from the under
? for the summer
Chelsea my squad but i know some ?
