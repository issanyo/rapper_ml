[Intro]
Crazy hood
My nigga EFN
Haz on the beat
It's going down like that

[Chorus: Gunplay]
I'm coming through, I'm coming down, I'm swerving lane 2 lane
I'm smoking good, I'm gripping wood like it ain't no thang
These hoes is chasing me, I'm chasing dollars like I should
Round and round we go, everyday that's how we do it

[Verse 1: Gunplay]
Money in my sneakerbox, riding till my speakers pop
Rolling till my tires bald, serving till my beeper stop
Gucci's on my feet and belt, I'm ghetto ain't no secret kept
Now I'm balling and you falling into deeper debt
I keep a Swisher and a bitch to roll up every L
Her body look like it's from heaven, but I give her hell
She suck me proper then say "Papa, I need hair and nails"
I say "Hold up" then I just give her a stale stair
I come from the bottom where you're dead before you reach the top
Yo homies phony and your bitch is just a greasy thot
Don't hate the player, hate the game, I ain't make the rules
Since a minor I've been grinding making major moves
I ride Mercedes Benz CL63 Exactly
My AMG's hit the turf, the defense couldn't sack me
Hit the club, poppin' bub, hoes flicking pose
Bending over trying to show me how they grip them toes

[Chorus: Gunplay]
I'm coming through, I'm coming down, I'm swerving lane 2 lane
I'm smoking good, I'm gripping wood like it ain't no thang
These hoes is chasing me, I'm chasing dollars like I should
Round and round we go, everyday that's how we do it
I'm coming through, I'm coming down, I'm swerving lane 2 lane
I'm smoking good, I'm gripping wood like it ain't no thang
These hoes is chasing me, I'm chasing dollars like I should
Round and round we go, everyday that's how we do it

[Verse 2: Denzel Curry]
Riding around with that Gunplay, stunting on the hoes when I go down a one way street
Leave the hoes like Pompeii, its a ice age consider me Victor Freeze
Hold up, what in the fuck do you mean? Hold up, they stop when I step on the scene
Handsome ass nigga it runs in my genes, DNA on her face when I bust it and leave
Oh shit, look out jit, yo girl shining like '98 trick
Thug dot com, let me read my palms pilot
Down to a science, I'm riding inside her, and I'm higher so no don't save your hang gliders
Put dick in her mouth, said she feeling the highest
When it comes to the pussy you know she's the tightest
I transform like Jackie Chan with the Talisman
Still grinding like I'm Clipse, but Denny has no malice man
We shroomed out she dumping the mollies in her chalice man
Rep Aaliyah, I'm rocking the boats so she call me El Capitan
Como te llamas? Que pasa?
I'm Denzel Curry, still fucking around with these boppers
But who the fuck you think you trying to creep on?
It's a nigga in a black Nissan, nigga I'm the nigga Freddy wouldn't sleep on
Shine like the silver serving of Capri Sun
Free Max B

[Chorus: Gunplay]
I'm coming through, I'm coming down, I'm swerving lane 2 lane
I'm smoking good, I'm gripping wood like it ain't no thang
These hoes is chasing me, I'm chasing dollars like I should
Round and round we go, everyday that's how we do it
I'm coming through, I'm coming down, I'm swerving lane 2 lane
I'm smoking good, I'm gripping wood like it ain't no thang
These hoes is chasing me, I'm chasing dollars like I should
Round and round we go, everyday that's how we do it

[Outro]
Crazy hood
Mothafucking EFN in the house
MMG, C9 up in this bitch
Dade County shit nigga
