[Intro]
Denny Cascade

[Hook]
Got hella hoes like a home depot so you already know
I gotta keep that hammer
Juicy J shades on a nigga eyelids
Sea Fonk bitch, rockin' with a Fiji bandanna
Let me take you underwater
You not a dime you a quarter
Flex nigga like yoga
Complex nigga I'm Yoda
Mothafucka I'm a soldier
Fuck her suckin' on my cobra
You don't wanna say it's over
But she wanna bend over
Denny, I'm a supernova
Flat nights make you stronger
Feel like I don’t belong here
Feeling like I don’t belong here

[Verse 1]
Denny Cascade, rollin' wit a green AK
Ain't Eazy, like I'm bumpin' Dre Day
But a nigga ain’t cray, Denny got the answers, no Ye
But when the white comes I Sway
Niggas be prey, slaves to the ways everyday
Save a ho, S curled in the cape, doggin' these hoes
Nigga raw doggin these hoes, until the bitch say she's late
Bitches on my dick, purple weed like Prince
Better tell these hoes, bitch I ain't Clark Kent
Denny Cascade charge hoes like rent
Bumpin' triple-6 chiefin' while I'm shining moonlit
In a Cadliac, splat, puff on the doja, the thraxx
Pushin', she burn, the cat
Beat the pussy up all the way to the max
I beat the pussy up all the way to the mat

[Hook]
Got hella hoes like a home depot so you already know
I gotta keep that hammer
Juicy J say that a nigga I knew
Sea Fonk bitch, rockin' with a Fiji bandanna
Let me take you underwater
You not a dime you a quarter
Flex nigga like yoga
Complex nigga I'm Yoda
Mothafucka I'm a soldier
Fuck her suckin' on my cobra
You don't wanna say it's over
But she wanna bend over
Denny, I'm a supernova
Flat nights make you stronger
Feel like I don’t belong here
Feeling like I don’t belong here

[Verse 2]
Okay the moon is out, blunt is lit
Ride around space fuckin' the baddest bitch
Divin' in the portal cuz we splashin' in
You know the captain is...Denny Cascade
Mr. Universe, gangster
Hanging mouth down like an anchor
All my bitch wanna kiss like Kankers
Get your hoes like lookin' up a chaser
But if you need that, I got it
Presidential new Reaganomics
Break it down smoking on the chronic
It's the shaman, Denny Cascade
And you know it's me, come with me
Fried as the lock on the Aqua Teen
Purple the galaxy I can see
But this is how truly you know it's me

[Hook]
Got hella hoes like a home depot so you already know
I gotta keep that hammer
Juicy J say that a nigga I knew
Sea Fonk bitch, rockin' with a Fiji bandanna
Let me take you underwater
You not a dime you a quarter
Flex nigga like yoga
Complex nigga I'm Yoda
Mothafucka I'm a soldier
Fuck her suckin' on my cobra
You don't wanna say it's over
But she wanna bend over
Denny, I'm a supernova
Flat nights make you stronger
Feel like I don’t belong here
Feel like I don’t belong here
