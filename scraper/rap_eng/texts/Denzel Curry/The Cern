[Verse 1: Nyyjerya]
First, you hit the corner, then you dump the burner
Weavin' through the shit like my name was Sojourner
I'ma take you on a journey in one direction
When I rock shit with my pop shit, pocket rocket in your noggin
You be on that opp shit, left me with no option
Niggas get the droppin' when it come to my bands
You want that real love, then you gotta understand
There's more to a bond than just flexin' on the gram
It's more to that girl than what she wanna hear
She like get up out my ear or better yet, play the rear
Caboose is loose, like the truth I'm tellin' you
My life is like an edible, take a bite and I will enter you
Exit you in a way that's pleasurable, left no residue
Just a stain up on my baby, boo
She gave me brain just like a lecture, dude
I'm feelin' intellectual whenever I am next to you

[Chorus: Nyyjerya]
Me and Lord Lu C N was hittin' licks, homie
That was 'round the time when niggas switched on me
I was jailed up cause a nigga snitched on me
I don't trust a soul, now I'm back on my lonely
Me and Lord Lu C N was hittin' licks, homie
That was 'round the time when niggas switched on me
I was jailed up cause a nigga snitched on me
I don't trust a soul, now I'm back on my lonely

[Verse 2: Nyyjerya]
And I'm back in the hood, these niggas think they know me
Hold up, bitch, you know how I'm chillin', hella low-key
How you heard about me? Who talkin' through the grapevines?
When I find out, I'mma hit 'em with my .9 nine times
That's a deadass cat, I'm speakin' deadass facts
Stop a rat in his tracks, pull out with the all-black MAC
When I'm in the skies, niggas drop like flies
My people call me Ny, I got that NY state of mind

[Interlude: Denzel Curry]
"Man, you just like all those other knuckleheads that be runnin' around here. Tryna be somethin' out yourself, by doin' evil shit. See, that's why you ain't gon' be shit, nigga! You over here, hittin' licks, talkin' bout fuckin' bitches and hoes and all of that shit. That shit ain't gon' matter, nigga. We all gon' die. You gon' die, I'm gon' die, we all gon' die. Ain't gon' make the best time on this earth and you gon' die at the age of 22. Nigga."

[Chorus: Nyyjerya]
Me and Lord Lu C N was hittin' licks, homie
That was 'round the time when niggas switched on me
I was jailed up cause a nigga snitched on me
I don't trust a soul, now I'm back on my lonely
Me and Lord Lu C N was hittin' licks, homie
That was 'round the time when niggas switched on me
I was jailed up cause a nigga snitched on me
I don't trust a soul, now I'm back on my lonely
