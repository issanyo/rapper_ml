[Verse 1: Dillon Cooper]
Uh, certified legend
Bow to the God when he step into our presence
Premonitions I be getting make a nigga see the future
Off with their heads, King Cooper, huh
Oh lawd I'm a shadowcaster
Getting bitches wet when I play that guitar
Axl rose. my guns is black, straight as slacks
I don't trust none of them niggas
Cause when the time is right they show their  colors my nigga
Thats why im catching out ?
East side we fly, high grade, A+ in the jeep far, Beast Coast
Niggas taking your bitch like a stolen Rover
Getting brain at a lot at Rolling Roaster
So you wanna get high?
Elevate and levitate into the sky
You realize like we speak truth
Samurai mindstate we see you
So blind like the Beegees, never gonna be me
Weed in my lungs pump it out like a chimney
? gemini
Bow to the master, listen to the teacher

[Verse 2: Azizi Gibson]
I roll a hundred blunts for my killers
Then I roll two blunts for my chick
Cause she don't really smoke that much
She be coughing all just with one little hit
I said as much as it makes you feels sideways
Smoking up like every day is Friday
Rolling up while I'm smoking I ain't even leave my fucking driveway
Flicking joints while I'm on the highway
I just want it my way
All of my people be blunted, step in this bitch know we smell funky
All of your people be on me, so back up for we start dabbing nigga whut
Im alive why of the blunt, hope you not a bum cause we finna tear this shit up
20 grams thats 10 blunts, nigga light it up when the cops lookin I don't give a fuck
All these girls ? keep rolling up she a champ, damn give that girl a belt
I don't never need no help, I smoke all day young nigga take that myself
My time invested in a uzi, nigga feeling free like boosie
Bullets getting high, get coochie, [?] And I'm guccie unless that ass some boujee
Welcome to the Eyes of the World
Fuck that, niggas got eyes on your girl
We gone run the world, Zone 3, Brooklyn, Thailand
You fuckniggas really got some nerves
Knocking on the door when you see do not disturb
Everything I get it Imma swerve
If you ain't know, shit you gonna learn

[Verse 3: Denzel Curry]
Got a vagina up in the hemisphere and raw dog the world (world)
Rolling my dynamite, exploding the paper genetic make up up on your girl (girl)
Steadily travellin' through the wave of the cosmic powers [?]
Parody parody couldn't compare to me even if you was my twin (twin)
