[Hook: Denzel Curry]
Bitch my jeweler a jew
And my lawyer is too
And my bitch is Brazilian
But she know i'm a gook
Bitch my suit is Italian
Have a glaze on the shoes
See a young nigga shinin'
I might give it a blues
Bitch my jeweler a jew
And my lawyer is too
And my bitch is Brazilian
But she know i'm a gook
Bitch my suit is Italian
Have a glaze on the shoes
See a young nigga shinin'
I might give it a blue, damn

[Verse 1: Nell & Shakewell]
I guess my lawyer a jew
But my bitch from Jamaica
Hollow tips in the clip she gon' suck the dick cause i make her
Carol city conglomerate came to shake the equator
We collect off more capers, more paper piled on more paper more paper
I wake up to that pressure, we bang deep in the mecka
Fuck a faker i'm faded like fader diamond collector
Donald trump is our president still in black on black residence
Mystical style for forever everything else on the stretcher
Boy we bomb with the sauce, i just might die by the juice
Got a 8 in the liter, i drop some percs in it too
God bless my killers in mexico who be back in a two
They leave you headless and bloody it don't even make the news
I woke up and hit the blunt and kick the purp back in
I pour up check my account and get the work back in
Its no love I'm just a scrub who got the streets locked in
I'm re-up just for my blocks and now we all parked in

[Verse 2: Pouya & Denzel Curry]
Flow that boy came out the mall you know I'm frugal like a jew
I can't pay no bitch no mind my time is not enough for you
I woke up to a check, i wish that we never met
Your morning texts is irrelevant can't get me in my bed
I give a fuck bout the show, home alone with the chrome
Might just pull up and pull out the pistol blow at your dome
I've been scoping and hoping these hoes gon leave me alone
Underground Underdog never be flexing don't be hitting my phone, bitch
Federal they tryna be, but nigga take a pick
Never seen a nigga ride around inside a crown vic
I've been getting money ever since a nigga was a jit
Pledge the arma nigga not religion falling to my real shit
Denzel not your ordinary homosapien
Ben 10 switching all the swagger i'm an alien
Musty ass kush getting blowed no Arabian
What's your jeweler name? Shit I think his name is Fabian
