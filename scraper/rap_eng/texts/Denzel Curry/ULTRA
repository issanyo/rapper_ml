[Verse 1: Yung Kane]
Money and power
Rolling and blowing the sour
I could see you as a coward
You get devoured
This is a lyrical shower
Watch me release all this power
Just counting the hour to come
Where the real will be praised
And the child will be able to raise
No fail, this story of polices inflicting they rage
Trying to put us in a grave
Back up nigga make space
Let the tec burn
Couldn't even save face
ULT coming fucking up the place
TRNE we the new generation
Patience the key but a nigga won't shake
So it come down to it then I'm coming at your neck
Keep a grip on respect
Everybody show love
All I know is trill niggas, you don't really want war

[Verse 2: Nell]
Back up now it's time to wreck
This TEC get right in his chest
Town hall got me all upset
Cause they turned in and then go double check
These niggas don't pose a threat
Put them in that cobra stretch
I be got them close to death
From fucking with the ultimate
I guess this how we 'posed to get
I'm about to expose some shit
These boys don't be real so now I watch who I be smoking with
It's best you watch your mouth and pay attention to how close you get
Is they really feeling me?
If they is it's silly me
Jesus walks within the sea
But most people be scared to bleed
Like curse release some sacred need
Pain and grief remain in reach
Doubt you'll be restraining me
Give you what you came to see
No matter who you be's
My G there'll never be a change in me

[Verse 3: Slikk]
Lately I've been trafficking the H
Trap's backed up like Sonic
Got a couple chickens in the safe
Got em waiting for whoever say they want it
Spend the bread and pull up in the Wraith
Kill a hooker pussy leave her stomach haunted
Get yo' ass the fuck up out my face
Your sloppy coochie wasn't worth the couple hundred
I've been fucking bitches each and every day
I might as well, cause I ain't stuck in jail gunnin'
And I'm indifferent to these bitches throwing shade
And in their face I'm there to keep on throwing money
Dirty thumper on my mother fuckin' waist
I got the tip for when the bitch get bloody
I got 'em messing up, I'm all up in her brain
Plus every other bitch in there they wanna suck me
Now they plotting on me, bopping on me, opping on me, I'm the one that got you homie
Not the phony, out to Coney Island styling, wiling, kicking doors, and robbing
Not a problem, bought the carbon, beg your pardon, there's a party, fled authority
Foreign forgies, whores and orgies, all them gorgeous, Bentleys, Porsches

[Verse 4: Rell]
Shell toes and Timberlands to the cement
Ten toes on the gravel grinding for a reason
Pulling out the region
I'm an archangel not a demon
See the narcs tweaking heavy fiending
Ten hoes want a bottle, fuck 'em on a balcony, I'm rolling green in
Pop that pussy leave it leaking
Now I pop a nigga, is he breathing?
You a phono Chapo, faking what you preaching?
You should get an Oscar acting like a bitch
Ye'en hanging with the clique
And it bust, we ultimate
Got a temper tantrum with the fits
You is not a shooter if you miss
These niggas leeching, fleas and ticks
Bitch I'm not a blood donor
Run the heat and lick that marijuana
Follow me to live another summer
I need to get it all
Stevie Wonder if you blind
Plugging that new state of mind
Niggas bugging in the flies
[?]
In the city, take you for survival

[Verse 5: Denzel Curry]
Break, dive in the flow
Intervessel when I drive in a soul
Imma have a ball with the glow
Kids next door, jits, stick it to the cold, wet
I keep that fuck shit to a minimum
Government ain't shit, never giving up
Six feet deep in a beat
When I'm digging up
Now you sleep, on the head, of the indica, smoke
Invasive with the parasite bite, light
Cause you wanna know what's in sight, foe
Dark as the evil, the evil
I do not change but I evolve
Bitch, Imma drop a napalm, bomb
Said that I'll ring the alarm, gun
Water elemental law, cost
Found it and let it get lost
Bitch, common sense, comments could miss
Treason and treachery, left in a trench, trench
Aborting into an abyss
Perpetrators rest and piss in a ditch
Pit, falling forever whenever you fuck with the emperor's ship
They might sweet talk your face to a chocolate chip
Closed casket, I'm out this bitch
Ultra
