[Verse 1: Mikky Ekko]
Look at how far we've come
Look at this mess we've made
I'm still praying that the sun
Tears my body from the shade
Tell me that we're too far gone
Tell me that we'll be okay
Swear to God I'd leave right now
If Heaven wasn't so far away

[Pre-Chorus: Mikky Ekko]
But this is not an exercise
And nobody gets out alive
Stop, what if I, what if I stop?

[Chorus: Mikko Ekko]
Mourning doves, meet me in the morning
Love, what if I, what if I die before you wake?
Promise, I promise you can lean on me, lean on me
I can be your shoulder
There's still room for us to pull over
But we can't stop
So in the morning, love
We can be together like mourning doves

[Verse 2: Denzel Curry]
If I’m not seen in the morning, then I will catch you in the late night
Like DJ Quik makin’ dollas, she said she in love with a nigga that’s paid right
Morning, morning, us, he get a mar with no sorrow
Projects we live in, saying we're the Dominican
Trappin' that stuff to Key Largo
Wells Fargo, I’m gettin’ this money, so don’t even worry about my bank
Not in New Orleans, it’s raining, it’s pouring whenever I tell you I’m not the same
But we gon’ be straight, 180 degrees, fuck fairy tales, who lives happily?
Think of a question, hypothesis, guessed it, so thank you reporting so accurately
It’s like first year, cuz of my air, meanin’ I fuck my queen
If you my dove, need all my love, go ahead and spread yo wings
No new friends, no new friends, no new friends, ain’t no new
Ratty ass bitches and thirsty ass niggas cuz you got me and I got you
Nothing was the same a year ago, you want me to stay but here I go
So here I go, I been at shigoes, enter a phantom I'm  Murcielago
Drivin’, hybird, I’m high as slow risin’
She is crying, so I shower to her eyelid

[Chorus: Mikko Ekko]
Mourning doves, meet me in the morning
Love, what if I, what if I die before you wake?
Promise, I promise you can lean on me, lean on me
I can be your shoulder
There's still room for us to pull over
But we can't stop
So in the morning, love
We can be together like mourning doves
We can be together like mourning doves
We can be together like mourning doves
