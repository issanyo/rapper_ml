[Verse]
The Big Bang happened when the black balloon ignited
I feel the pain shoulder to shoulder as I was knighted
The night turns to day and my days don't seem the brightest
Its like itis, I wanna take a bite out of what life is
If the President fuck around and piss off ISIS
Bury me in blueberry bills, jewels and ices
Lets connect from mind to mind
Lies are on the rise, increase to bigger size
Hard to victimize when he was idolized
Inside my battered mind, I have visions of being broke
A broken man writing words of wisdom inside these notes
Shattered and lost, chattering talk
Blabbering off, grabbing the cross
Tell that Jesus nothing matters to me (uh huh)
The black balloon floats
The black balloon flies
The black balloon pops
The black balloon dies
I must be the black balloon then
The children of the world always speak the truth, and
The earth will soon end, we all perish
All parents, all kids, all buried
Cemetery, ceremonious
Fight me at my loneliest
Life is the ugliest bitch I ever messed with
When she quickly down that nut back like Nesquik
Never tried to take my life, you get your chest hit
Counting paper with Nyyjerya till my flesh split

[Chorus]
We all cry
The day the black balloon explodes, we all die
The army couldn't handle the truth, we all lie
They wake to see the real exposed, till they like:
"Take that fucking shit until my casket close"
We all cry
The day the black balloon explodes, we all die
The army couldn't handle the truth, we all lie
They wake to see the real exposed, till they like:
"Take that fucking shit until my casket close"
We all cry

[Outro]
Can you take me baby
Can you take me baby
