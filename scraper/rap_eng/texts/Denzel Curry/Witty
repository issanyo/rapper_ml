[Intro: Bishop]
Look, I ain't shit
I ain't never gonna be shit
And you less of a man than me
So as soon as I decide that you ain't gon' be shit (pow!)
So be it

[Chorus]
They said I wouldn't be shit
Now I'm the shit, nigga check this out
Pull off with your bitch like skrrt
Then skeet off in that bitch mouth
What goes around comes around
Be cautious what you dish out
Used to have that work back in the day
But I'm legit now [2x]

[Verse 1: Deniro Farrar]
Pull off with another nigga women like it's nothin'
Fightin' with temptations nigga I am David Ruffin
Up it I'ma buss it you can trust that I ain't bluffin'
Firecracker temper, I be snappin' over nothin'
Make a call to boss, said he gone kill you 'cause he love me
Grew up rough and rugged, I am no stranger to rugby
Bitches used to diss me, now they tell me that they love me
I ain't let her fuck me, now she begging me to suck it
I'm two different people right now, I don't give a fuck
Don't really do convo, if we talkin' we gone fuck, so wassup
Handcuffing women never been my get down
Treated me like shit, but now they can't, 'cause I'm the shit now
Used to have that work back in the day [?]
[?]  had for the [?]
Hate when the familiar faces act as if they know me
I don't fuck with new niggas, lil' homie I be lowkey

[Chorus]
They said I wouldn't be shit
Now I'm the shit, nigga check this out
Pull off with your bitch like skrrt
Then skeet off in that bitch mouth
What goes around comes around
Be cautious what you dish out
Used to have that work back in the day
But I'm legit now [2x]

[Verse 2: Denzel Curry]
I got, a brother in the grave, friends in the pen
Made more enemies than I made friends
My best friend turned into my kin
Time when they worried about when I'm in
I love god but I really love sin
Sin to the city, show titty and the kitty
Halfway genius but halfway crazy
Halfway sober, halfway wavy
Not that matched, my ex left my heart detached
Mother left at sixteen, uncle on crack
My life not intact, servin sack
With a fuck nigga that I used to live with
Come to find out he get beat by bitches, but let me end it
Rewind it to a time where I would find myself
Self employ, I signed myself
Mind of a Gemini rose so high
Aquarius vibe to the life I lie in
Got into a sight, it's, that these niggas ain't friends
Just associates, affiliate
Building a plan like Ferb and Phineas
Superficial, supernatural, prayed to God, that's my Allah
Only face the pain in time they told me that it's in Shalah
This the point at life you couldn't try me like no bitch now
Said I wasn't shit, now look at me girl I'm the shit now

[Chorus]
They said I wouldn't be shit
Now I'm the shit, nigga check this out
Pull off with your bitch like skrrt
Then skeet off in that bitch mouth
What goes around comes around
Be cautious what you dish out
Used to have that work back in the day
But I'm legit now [2x]
