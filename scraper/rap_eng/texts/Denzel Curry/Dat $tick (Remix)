[Verse 1]
I say it's Imperial
Curry is the sickest individual
Spitting liquid swords with no need for Bobby Digital
Genius
I'm mischievous
I'm the king of this
When it comes to features, I'm the only nigga breathing bitch
Killing tracks
Bitch I got the Glock to your weave
Tried to put me in a box, but yet I bob and I weave
You can have Bob's Burger, if you talking 'bout beef
Know some niggas with heat
Between they shirts and they briefs
Hollow tips catch a favorite, niggas copy and bleach
Boy you think you street
Yo ass barely a guard rail
Call me young Yu-Gi-Oh!
'Cause Curry play his cards well
Ninja turtle bullets, so you know that be a hard shell
If them other few niggas try to harm me
Then that just proves that I'm a one man army
Never hated people that be putting in work
All you underground niggas just competing for dirt
Earth, I'm down to it which explains why I'm blessing bitch
The greater the power I possess, thatâ€™s an exorcist

[Interlude]
Ah shit, I fucked up, I fucked up
But aye, can we keep going?

[Verse 2]
My nigga came through, rolled a spliff
And I'm finna go and lift into the heavens
I don't really give a fuck, I'm a lucky number seven
If I shoot a number seven
Then there's gonna be eight
I don't really give a fuck, all you rappers get ate
Like meals nigga, I want mills nigga
You chase deals
Nigga, I gets killed everything that you own
I don't really give a fuck, I'm gone
I got Dat $tick, 'cause I got that shit
Like I'm living in the woods, I'm a bear in this bitch
Yeah, I fuck really bare in this bitch
I don't really give a fuck, what I'mma wear in this shit
Like uh, ya'll know everything that's going on
I don't really give a fuck, nigga I'm just flowing on
Like water rapids, nigga, I'm just rappin'
I don't really give a fuck, I'm about to go in, ah!
