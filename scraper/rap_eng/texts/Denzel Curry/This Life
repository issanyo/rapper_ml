[Chorus]
Didn't notice, but as of late, I think I changed
Not the same since my younger days, so far I came
Feel my pain till I can't complain, cause I'ma slide for a minute
Till I rise in the business, make a billion, show my niggas what up
In this life, middle fingers up I don't fuck with a 9 to 5
I keep it true to me, why the fuck would I live a lie?
I'm living in this world, would you care if I live or die?
Are you down, then would you ride for me?
Because this life is so fucked up they telling lies to me
You are my main and as my main you'd better not lie to me
And I would tell you like Geminis there might be sides to me
She not my main bitch, I'ma tell you she's a side to me

[Verse 1]
Like, she assigned to me, but you are designed for me
And if I say I got your back then hold my spine for me
And if I couldn't shed a tear, girl, would you cry for me?
And if we was a couple doves, girl would you fly with me?
I'm overseas, what I oversee, ocean sea, see reflections of the way we supposed to be
Unluckily, we not at peace
That's the end of my clover leaf
Wouldn't care if you know it's me
Keep away until you notice me

[Chorus]
Didn't notice, but as of late, I think I changed
Not the same since my younger days, so far I came
Feel my pain till I can't complain, cause I'ma slide for a minute
Till I rise in the business, make a billion, show my niggas what up
In this life, middle fingers up I don't fuck with a 9 to 5
I keep it true to me, why the fuck would I live a lie?
I'm living in this world, would you care if I live or die?
Are you down, then would you ride for me?
Because this life is so fucked up they telling lies to me
You are my main and as my main you better not lie to me
And I would tell you like Geminis there might be sides to me
She not my main bitch, I'ma tell you she's a side to me

[Verse 2]
She told me that I wasn't losing her, that she losing me
L-O-V, -E, we outta gas, I'll see you in a week
Thinking that, you won't fornicate with niggas that you meet
But silly me, now we are the same, Cupid admit defeat
Girl, are you out of your mind? I would think you were mine
You were a part of me, pardon me, parts of me died
Idolized you when I didnâ€™t unite
You won't tell for the moment, but time will tell, but as of now

[Chorus]
You didn't notice, but as of late, I think I changed
Not the same since my younger days, so far I came
Feel my pain till I can't complain, cause I'ma slide for a minute
Till I rise in the business, make a billion, show my niggas what up
In this life, middle fingers up I don't fuck with a 9 to 5
I keep it true to me, why the fuck would I live a lie
I'm living in this world, would you care if I live or die
You down, then would you ride for me?
Because this life is so fucked up they telling lies to me
You are my main and as my main you'd better not lie to me
And I would tell you like Geminis there might be sides to me
She not my main bitch, I'ma tell you she's a side to me

[Outro]
Me-e-ayee
She is a side to me
She is a side to me
But you are designed for me-
You're designed for me
But you are designed for me-
You're designed for me
