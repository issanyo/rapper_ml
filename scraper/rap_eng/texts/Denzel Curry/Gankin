[Intro: 8Ball]
Tight grip on the Tec 9, now it's time to creep
Hollow tips in the clip puttin' suckas in a a deep sleep

[Hook: 8Ball]
Niggas on the gank, might do better at a bank
Cuz I'm packin what you lackin' and I'm shootin' like a tank

[Verse 1: J.K. The Rapper]
Because I'm
Because I'm packin what you lackin' and I'm shootin' like a tank
Niggas on the gank, might do better at a bank
What you drank?
Smokin' dank
Come through like "Fuck what you claim"
Repping my gang
FANG all on my brain
Tryna maintain while I'm switchin' these lanes
Swerve
Roll up a blunt of that Indica herb
A 90's bitch what I prefer
In the passenger seat of my two seater
Her curves they got me blurred
I'm slurred
I'm drivin' all up on the curb
40 ounce got me mixin' up my words
Now she trippin'
Bitches think I'm soft cause I treat them with respect
But I won't hesitate to smack a bitch with my dick (haha)
Livin' like it's 96 (six, six)
On you tricks
Would thought Wesley Snipes is in here, cause
Black is the color of the gear, and
Black is the color of the year, and
Black is the color of the niggas in your rearview mirr-
Can't see clear
Better lock them doors cause

[Hook: 8Ball]
Niggas on the gank, might do better at a bank
Cuz I'm packin what you lackin' and I'm shootin' like a tank

[Verse 2: Denzel Curry]
Ready to gank, takin' this bank
Shootin' my bullets like No Limit tanks
Smokin' these niggas just roll up the swisher
My attitude blunt when I smoke 'em like jenk
Four, five, Triple Six
Act like I said that and niggas is pissed
Lyricist killin' it what is the difference
Niggas is thinkin' this Infamous
Nina the beaner the bullet between her
I open her trunk with the chopp-er
Bedded then shredded, them bitches beheaded
I'm shootin these niggas like shottas
Dumb little hoes you ain't runnin' no game
Aquarius Killa that nigga the mayne
Koopsta the nigga I'm rollin' the swisher
I get the big picture, I'm makin' a stank
Homie talkin' shit, bruh
Nigga think he gettin' me
Spray his ass, kill his chick
Drop him in the sea and leave
Raven is not the one
Y'all niggas just can't stop me
Killin' these niggas just pullin' the trigger
It's hard to see that autopsy
Pass me the plastic Glock
His ass is shot, I feel like Pac
Under the pressure the heat in my dresser
They tellin' these niggas they gettin' what's got
Popped by Aquarius
The nigga come and gut you
Lord to the infamous, killin' the ...
Future bounty hunter

[Hook: 8Ball]
Niggas on the gank, might do better at a bank
Cuz I'm packin what you lackin' and I'm shootin' like a tank

Tight grip on the Tec 9, now it's time to creep
Hollow tips in the clip puttin' suckas in a a deep sleep
