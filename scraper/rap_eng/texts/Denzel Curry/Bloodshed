[Verse 1]
Bitch I'm ultimate
When I flow, I drop bombs like a Soviet
Not a communist, but I'm anonymous
Zero tolerance if niggas talking shit
Now you talking, the end of the partnership
Had to cut that bitch off
Send that bitch off with a fucking sawed-off
Being too nice isn't giving a fuck
Cause these internet niggas be thinking I'm soft
What are you, lost? Come down the one way
I don't fuck with none of you niggas the long way
Step into the Ultimate is the wrong way
I'm a real ass nigga, y'all boys is anime
Characters, I will embarrass you
You don't want war in this game, ain't no challenger, boy
Rather get paper and stack it, my boy
With a bad bitch in a Challenger, boy

[Pre-Hook]
You don't want no motherfucking problems
You don't want beef, might as well play possum, dead
Kneel before the almighty dread
Reiterate everything that I said

[Hook]
Denzel, why you had to make bloodshed?
Cause a fuck nigga fucked with the ultimate
Denzel, why you had to make bloodshed?
Cause a fuck nigga fucked with the ultimate
Denzel, why you had to make bloodshed?
Cause a fuck nigga fucked with the ultimate
28 in a clip, I'ma shoot what's left
Fucking with a black star, but I ain't Mos Def
Biatch

[Verse 2]
Bitch I'm ultimate
When I'm spitting it's lyrical syphilis
I'm intelligent but I get ignorant
Not so famous but yet I am infamous
I'm a dick and y'all niggas is feminist, put the ill in the Iliad
Fuck that I'm taking the odd out of Odyssey
Denzel got a murdering policy
With no remorse, not accepting apologies
No jewelries, speaking tomfoolery
Fuck the rap game, I'ma speak at my eulogy
Bury them
Like a smoothie, my nigga, I bury them
In this world I feel like a terrarium
Out of my cranium, back in my stadium, starship
Giving you all of my hardship
Don't give a fuck about a car, whip, slip

[Pre-Hook]
You don't want no motherfucking problem
You don't want beef, might as well play possum, dead
Kneel before the almighty dread
Reiterate everything that I said

[Hook]
Denzel, why you had to make bloodshed?
Cause a fuck nigga fucked with the ultimate
Denzel, why you had to make bloodshed?
Cause a fuck nigga fucked with the ultimate
Denzel, why you had to make bloodshed?
Cause a fuck nigga fucked with the ultimate
28 in a clip, I'ma shoot what's left
Fucking with a black star, but I ain't Mos Def
Denzel, why you had to make bloodshed?
Cause a fuck nigga fucked with the ultimate
Denzel, why you had to make bloodshed?
Cause a fuck nigga fucked with the ultimate
Denzel, why you had to make bloodshed?
Cause a fuck nigga fucked with the ultimate
28 in a clip, I'ma shoot what's left
Fucking with a black star, but I ain't Mos Def
Biatch
