[Verse 1: Lofty305]
When I met you had a thousand ones
Now you got a thousand hunnids, nah bitch let me tell you some
You know I love you but it's not your money
And it ain't your pussy, girl give it all to me
I mean your spirit-soul, bitch I can not let you go
You know you had me once, had me twice
I had to fuck like fifty thousand times
I knew it in my fucking mind, that i'd wife you up
I knew that in my fucking mind, we got a APC
You know these bitches hatin' me, cause I am not dating these
Broke ass bitches no having ass money ass
Joke ass bitches, I might choke that bitch
Cause she ain't had no money for a motherfucking P-I-M-P
Motherfucker bitch do you see I got a P and it's on a bitch
I'm smoking that shit to the fade with my fucking dawg
The motherfucking Posh Gang, yeah we in it bro
We in it bro

[Verse 2: Denzel Curry]
Tell your mama to pray for me
Niggas be dying in over these streets just for bravery
Nigga you know what that means, that's called mental slavery
Nigga I'm chasing thee after chase back I'm taking the
Paper and put it into a house and I'm livin' free
Or you pay the rent but how I can pay the rent
So I had to pay the bitch, I will put that bitch on a strip
Get all of my money bitch and bring it right back
I'm cruising to that Project Pat
But I'm in the Escalade that's my nigga Lofty
Wait, hold up, nigga let the AK raid
If a nigga try to take what's mine
Leave him sounding like mimes
My nigga came through like a fucking landmine
Explode, overload, Curry the killer the overdose
Ass gal what's that up that nose
And with the blow she blow
She's bout go inside her brain
Insane, what the fuck you sayin'
In the damn membrane, goddamn
