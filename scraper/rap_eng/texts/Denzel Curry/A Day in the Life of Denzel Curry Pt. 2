[Intro]
I do this for my niggas
I do this for myself
Enter my mind
That's all I can say nigga

[Verse]
Five in the morning turn to six
My life has turned into a bitch
With the fucking wettest clit in the galaxy
Rapidly tripping and rapping and snapping
And killing my niggas that coming through blasting
And looking for money and looking for magic
We sticking together like metal and magnets
Lutrashious, me and Mercedes up in the condo
On the phone for 9 months, we sparked the conver-sation
Enter the void, mind escaping
Racing, plus my heart rate went blazing
Ganja, as I ponder on graduation
Threats hit a nigga the points where I could make it
Not a contract could take what I created
Not on paper my clan name erased it
Down nigga since day one, I never hate shit
Same nigga tat 275 on the pavement
Got highs and lows on one path of greatness
18 years live life larger than basic
Marquis, Andrew, Darnell, etcetera
Its still my niggas, know things will get better but
Things take time, and all things change
Some people venture off and make they own lane
But the place is just the same from the F.L.A
But my cuzzo Chynaman got hit with the 8
From the clip
And my nigga William had his last trip
When he hung his self in his room, roll up the spliff
As I puff one, puff two for my niggas
Then three for the niggas that be hating
Nigga I don't care
Aquarius Killa, the Mack
Talk your girl up out her underwear
Let me bite that pussy like a god damn juicy bear
Suicidal thoughts I'm on my head to make it clear
Another life in day, hallucinate got me in my rear
Lamborghini dreams, Freddy Krueger is my shooter
Raider still the klan but C9 is the future
Bitch

[Outro]
Synthesize, and realize, that life's no game
Synthesize, and realize, that life's no game
Synthesize, and realize, life's no game
No game
No game
No game
I should have said it's no game
No game
No game
No game
Synthesize, and realize, life's no game
Synthesize, and realize, life's no game
No game
Synthesize, realize, life's no game
Synthesize, realize, life's no game
(Game over man)
