[Intro: J.K. The Reaper]
Bitch I'm bipolar I might (oh shit, ugh)
Bitch I'm bipolar I might (uhh, yeah)
Bitch I'm bipolar I might (fuck, ugh)
Bitch I'm bipolar I might switch, switch, switch
I remember when I was younger
One day I looked in the mirror and I asked myself "who are you?"
And he responded "shit nigga, I was gonna ask you"

[Verse 1: J.K. The Reaper]
See I done flew to places you ain't never been
I done fucked some hoes you could never have
It's a lot of questions you could never ask
I could come to your show and turn it into a blood bath
Damn, I paint these pictures like I paint my bitches, ugh
Kill niggas, told my wrist don't Stacy Keibler, ugh
I'm Scott Steiner with this big pump
In high school you were the loser that had a packed lunch
In high school I kept the knife in my bag tucked
My nigga had the pistol on 'em, had the whole school shook
I look in the mirror and meet a new me everyday shit
Tell her she ain't Oakland because that's the only bay shit
That's the only way shit, I'm so impatient
Forty Glock on me for any sticky situation
I'm two-faced and I'm proud of it, yeeaah
Gotta get these fuck niggas 'round from me, yeeaah

[Chorus: J.K. The Reaper]
Bitch I'm bipolar I might switch it up, switch it up
I don't know nobody, I don't give a fuck, give a fuck
If I pull up on you nigga give it up, give it up
If I pull up on you nigga give it up, give it up
Bitch I'm bipolar I might switch, I might switch
If I pull up on you, you gon' bitch, you gon' bitch
Bitch I'm bipolar I might switch it up, switch it up
Bitch I'm bipolar I might switch, switch, switch

[Verse 2: Denzel Curry]
I'm switchin' up like Palpatine turned into Sidious
I'm switchin' up like the Joker, so why you so serious?
I'm switchin' like a bad bitch when she's on her period
Man, I'm switchin' like the gears on The Fast and the Furious
Vin Diesel, you can see my smile and my evil
The style isn't feeble, you guys lookin' see-through
You lookin' like a motherfuckin' screen door
Nigga hol' up, I'm blowin' up the spot, C-4
Nigga hol' up, didn't y'all niggas seen before?
Like Chris Rock, you switchin' up on me
You get your shit rocked, shit knocked
Call it Mary-Kate, I'm bustin' twin Glock's
Slipknot, how the fuck I'm cold but yet my shit hot?
Red dot, followed by the bullet to the headshot
Bet' not switch on a nigga, click on a nigga, what the fuck
You switched on a nigga, I bet a nigga get the slump
(huh-ha-huh-ha!)

[Chorus: J.K. The Reaper]
Bitch I'm bipolar I might switch it up, switch it up
I don't know nobody, I don't give a fuck, give a fuck
If I pull up on you nigga give it up, give it up
If I pull up on you nigga give it up, give it up
Bitch I'm bipolar I might switch, I might switch
If I pull up on you, you gon' bitch, you gon' bitch
Bitch I'm bipolar I might switch it up, switch it up
Bitch I'm bipolar I might switch, switch, switch
