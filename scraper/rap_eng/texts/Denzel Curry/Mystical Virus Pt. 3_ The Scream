[Intro]

[Verse 1: Denzel Curry]
Gold bullet that's trapped in his temple
Was just the beginning of a deranged mental
The mind wasn't simple, the man wasn't gentle
They bust out the brain but got caught in the dimple
To bust out the dental, the tooth full of wisdom
With black on black tints, they jet in the rental
The young mane hearing the whisper of Sindel
With a gift since birth, if you answer this riddle: Who I be?
The fetus of a demon
Semen from the tip
Of the penis I'm the only thing
That you see when you're dreaming
Armageddon and aftermath
This may blog in paragraphs
Sit on a throne, full of X's and bones
Blowing smoke and I laugh
Turning sinners like you
Into my personal acid tabs
Let me put you up on game
I've been shot, burned, and stabbed, and
Still ain't deceased
I carry the mark of the beast
Now can you tell me
Who the fuck I be?
Damien, as the kid replies
Wine, red wine was the color of his eyes
Coughing a lot of blood like Piru, but he slowly dies
As his eyes close shut, in prison was his eternal life

[Hook: Denzel Curry]
And now that nigga scream like he Sindel
Yelling 'suicide' in his prison cell
Running with them demons since the age of 12
Life's never a game, watch him cut his vein

[Verse 2: Lil Ugly Mane]
He thought he wanted seven digits, the thickest bitches, the top position
Tried to make a profit off the poverty he lives in
Atrocities committed on the blocks that he got kids in
And now he pops prescriptions, he's in prison to suspicions
He fucked the Devil's daughter, now he pissed away forgiveness
Only sounds he hears are shots popping in the distance
Thinking that they coming, now he haunted by these visions
He knows that there's a dark, and a light, but he don't know the difference
He used to run around bangin', man, he love the shit
And now he sit around, waitin' for his punishment
Cops on some old beef, that's why he gotta hold heat
He's stuntin' like his daddy, even pops had the gold teeth
But pops went to prison back in '03
So lil man never got to listen to a OG
Never got to tell him other options that you don't see
So lil man grew up thinking prison where he supposed to be, Ugly

[Hook: Denzel Curry]
And now that nigga scream like he Sindel
Yelling 'suicide' in his prison cell
Running with them demons since the age of 12
Life's never a game, watch him cut his vein

[Verse 3: Mike G]
For the scene, see the best is never seen
They say I lack in appearances, but they lack in experience
I remain quiet like I'm in constant meditation
Only way to get in my place is expert and constant observation, nigga
Never compete, much less be winner at it
Seven days a week, I found my sinister
I control my perimeter, control isn't giving up
Every effort you attempt never amounts to enough
They talk around you, but you know you can't give in
And you part of the system, so they treat you just like them
Every action is countered, so just don't disturb my zen
Every student with honor knows you must deserve lessons, yeah
I roll with what every character should have
That's why I'm equipped with a black suit and mask, I blast
Now it's silent like when the Earth had begun
I am Genesis 1, this is God's work done
