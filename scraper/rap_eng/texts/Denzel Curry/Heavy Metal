[Intro]
(Gang, gang)
Me and my nigga Curry in this bitch
We gon' right now man, fuck y'all niggas

[Chorus: Thouxanbanfauni]
Big wheel (Big wheel), heavy metal (Heavy metal)
12 wanna pull up on me, then I push the petal (For real)
Level, level, level, level, I just upped my level (Upped my level)
Like a graveyard shift, probably need a shovel (Need a shovel)
Keep that 30 clip, hotter than the Devil (Than the Devil)
Pop a pussy nigga, pop him like some kettle (Like some kettle)
Pop the hood, pop the trunk, show your metal (Show your metal)
Automatic sticks, show your heavy metal (Heavy metal)

[Verse 1: Denzel Curry]
Heavy metal (Huh, huh), Metallica (Huh, huh)
Watch out for them crackers in the challenger (Hiya, ya)
Have a nigga staring at a calendar (Hiya, ya)
Then I let you go, they come right after ya (Hiya)
Ford Corona, on a corner, like the owner, uh
I'm a loner, not a stoner, count Fiona, uh
Gettin' guap on the block, bet you get Starfoxed
If I cop me a drop, got a thot with no top
Don't start, nah it won't be none
Out this world, I'm Zenon
To infinity and beyond
When I see 12, then I be gone
If they catch me one time, then they got me for eons
Gotta do it one time, for my bigger bro Treeon, on
When they catch a nigga, yeah I'm gone, gone
Forever M.O., I don't give a fuck about a muhfuckin' bio
I just don't wanna see your motherfuckin' CO

[Chorus: Thouxanbanfauni]
Big wheel (Big wheel), heavy metal (Heavy metal)
12 wanna pull up on me, then I push the petal (For real)
Level, level, level, level, I just upped my level (Upped my level)
Like a graveyard shift, probably need a shovel (Need a shovel)
Keep that 30 clip, hotter than the Devil (Than the Devil)
Pop a pussy nigga, pop him like some kettle (Like some kettle)
Pop the hood, pop the trunk, show your metal (Show your metal)
Automatic sticks, show your heavy metal (Heavy metal)
Big wheel (Big wheel), heavy metal (Heavy metal)
12 wanna pull up on me, then I push the petal (For real)
Level, level, level, level, I just upped my level (Upped my level)
Like a graveyard shift, probably need a shovel (Need a shovel)
Keep that 30 clip, hotter than the Devil (Than the Devil)
Pop a pussy nigga, pop him like some kettle (Like some kettle)
Pop the hood, pop the trunk, show your metal (Show your metal)
Automatic sticks, show your heavy metal (Heavy metal)
