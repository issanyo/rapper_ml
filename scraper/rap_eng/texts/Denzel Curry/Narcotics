"Why these, why these, why these, why these"

[Hook]
Why these crackers thinking that a nigga serve narcotics?
Just because I'm living doesn't mean a nigga got it
Why these crackers thinking that a nigga serve narcotics?
Just because I'm living doesn't mean a nigga got it

[Verse 1]
Aye, smoking and twisting I'm black and I'm gifted
These crackers be thinking that niggas get wicked
Ferocious and vicious they bust out and diss us
Imperial pistols that Narc on a mission
That's another nigga dead, hit 'em with the beam infrared
Frankly I'm fed up with Feds
Profiling because my dreads, long
Nigga that's Biggie, it's dead wrong
Head home, dro in the atmosphere
Wondering why they think a nigga selling narcotics
All because we niggas that be living in the projects
If I move funny they gon' hit me with the object
Objective is subject watch kill
Take you down if they know you got it
Brains in the street they'll leave you thoughtless
Damn

[Verse 2]
King of the mischievous South
Speaking with my deviant mouth
How do I feel since I'm black? Proud
What's the shit you represent? Cloud
Nine on the side of my hip, bow
This the return of the black, owl
Max Julien, bring the mac, out
Raven Miyagi is back, ow
Black metal fist got these other motherfuckers caught up in the mix
Put 'em in the bars when they didn't do shit
Got the opposition living on the offense
It's why I gotta grab my rifle
Think about survival, hand on the Bible, so
I won't let none of them take my soul
That's why a nigga stay on ten toes down

[Outro]
Why these niggas thinkin on the low that we got it?
Bitch because I got it doesn't mean a nigga got it
Why these niggas thinkin on the low that we got it?

Thinkin' every nigga is selling narcotics

Why do I have a lot of arrests? Because of harassment. Why is there harassment? Because them people that harass me, have set up a problem that made me, disagree with them violently and, and they, they set up these problem, in order to exploit me and other people like me

They think they're living in a police state and they become hostile toward the policemen

And why they wanna get rid of me? Because I'm saying something that might wake up other exploited people and some depressed people and if all these people ever get together, then these pigs that are exploiting us we'll be able to run them into the lake. That's why they wanna get rid of us

I want when they see me, they know that every day when I'm breathing, it's-it's-it's for us to go farther, you know? Every time I speak, I want the truth to come out, you know what I'm sayin'? Every time I speak, I want to shiver, and even if I get in trouble you know what I'm sayin'? That, ain't that what we're supposed to do?
