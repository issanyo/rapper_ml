[Hook]
I'm a different breed
Got your bitch on me
Feeling like I'm Curry, balling on your team
How you do this shit?
They keep asking me
Bitch I came to win, so I shoot the three
All my chains on feel like Mr. T
I ain't got no limits feel like Master P
I be sipping muddy this is not no tea
Plug hit my phone, come and shout with me
Rolling up that sticky, your bitch stuck to me
Even when I'm sleep, money in my dreams
Strippers on the floor, ones in my jeans
Sipping Dirty Sprite, nigga watch me lean
Cause I'm a different breed
Got your bitch on me
Feeling like I'm Curry, balling on your team
How you do this shit?
They keep asking me
Bitch I came to win, so I shoot the three

[Verse 1: Yung Simmie]
Bitch I came to win, so I shoot the three
Niggas playing foul they can't keep it G
Talking to the cops call it referees
You be cheap talking I keep cash on me
Thinking I'ma fall wake up out your dream
Thirty with the beam make a nigga lean
It's a murder scene I ain't see a thing
He be LeBron James he be switching teams
I be doing me, they like "Who is he?"
I be snatching bitches keep your jewelry
I with all my niggas fuck security
And my bitch bad no insecurities
The 30 on me like I wear a jersey
A sharp shooter call me Stephen Curry
I'm dunking on them like I'm James Worthy
I be King Simmie you ain't even worthy
I'm working late I get the money early
Had to kick her out she was mad annoying
Niggas hating but they bitch going
I pulled off I was in the foreign
My weed loud so you can't ignore it
These niggas sleeping I can hear them snoring
A different breed I smoke different weed I smoke OG It ain't got no seeds

[Verse 2: Denzel Curry]
Driven adrenaline dribble and dip in them Benjamins within this syndicate
This is my christening wickedness future no who is the wickedest infinite
Need me a crib with a picket fence counterfeit niggas don’t change they ain’t making sense never
Never could desert hot boy in the desert
Got hits like Maywheather you soft as my leather
Call me young Chester cause I get the cheddar
Eight balling no better
I’m with the vendetta, I’m shooting barrettas
God of the city just like the Favelas
My niggas all gangsters just like the Goodfellas
Hellen Keller niggas out of sight out of mind
Cloud 9 south side the affili homicide
Curry on the beat got a simmie on the side U-L-T, C9, 2-7-5
