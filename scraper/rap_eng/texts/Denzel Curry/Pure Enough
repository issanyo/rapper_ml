[Intro]
Baby

[Hook]
Are you pure enough
To keep it real with yourself when you in the mirror bruh?
Or when you all alone girl are you sure enough?
Keep it G is the key and that is the cure for us
You said you had enough
Are you pure enough?
To keep it real with yourself when you in the mirror cuz?
When you all alone girl are you sure enough?
Keep it G is the key and that is the cure for us
You said you had enough
Girl are you sure enough

[Verse 1]
February sixteenth, is the day I regret my birth
Most times I thought about ending it when I came into this Earth
Compared to Dracula, the man in the mirror I see is nothing reflecting on all of the bitches I got but none of them love me
Like the woman I donated my heart too without the surgery
Charity, short-term goals is longevity
Keeping it G is the key, and I told you that's the cure for us
When the tears fall down your eyes you ask yourself

[Hook]
Are you pure enough
To keep it real with yourself when you in the mirror bruh?
Or when you all alone girl are you sure enough?
Keep it G is the key and that is the cure for us
You said you had enough
Are you pure enough?
To keep it real with yourself when you in the mirror cuz?
When you all alone girl are you sure enough?
Keep it G is the key and that is the cure for us
You said you had enough
Girl are you sure enough

[Verse 2]
February fourteenth is just the day to repopulate
I never have no love south side of the Florida state
Love me for who I am, never love me for what I make
I travel around the world and yes I drove on the interstate
Niggas would though I was fraudulent?
Everything is politics
When coal turn into diamonds people want to praise and acknowledge it
Always quick to polish it
But quickly let me go
Happened to that young nigga with the nappy afro
He died around the same time that Lotto did
Now it's 2016 and I know what the motto is and
I don't need no Aubrey Graham just to make a hit
That's just another view from my iPhone 6
Free Mr. Zone 6
I know GUWOP is coming home
Just another Aquarius that you hate to the bone
You wanna be a thug
But you won't live in harmony
Lazy, I'm crazy I'm wishing that a nigga start with me
Last year just made a nigga less friendly
Approaching my adversaries
I know that people envy
My soul is still empty
All I see is pussies talking shit with they homeboys
Thats a modern day Ren & Stimpy
Girls wanna be classy but still dress skimpy
Not giving a fuck simply
Then wonder why people think your an escort
Keeping it G is the key and you know that be the cure for us
Mirror pieces fall and reflect on your life and ask

[Hook]
Are you pure enough
To keep it real with yourself when you in the mirror bruh?
Or when you all alone girl are you sure enough?
Keep it G is the key and that is the cure for us
You said you had enough
Are you pure enough?
To keep it real with yourself when you in the mirror cuz?
When you all alone girl are you sure enough?
Keep it G is the key and that is the cure for us
You said you had enough
Girl are you sure enough
