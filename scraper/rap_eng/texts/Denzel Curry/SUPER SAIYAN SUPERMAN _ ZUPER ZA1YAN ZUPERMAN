[Intro]
AHHHHHHH!

[Chorus]
Super Saiyan, nah (yuh)
Curry got the hair like a Super Saiyan, yuh, uh (yuh)
You the man, nah
Pockets lookin' fatter than the Buddha man, yuh, uh (yuh)
Ricky Tan, uh
All my kicks fly like I'm Jackie Chan, uh, yuh
Nigga playin', uh
Show these niggas how to fuckin' make a band, uh, uh (yeah)

[Verse]
Little bitch ride
I don't fuck with anyone that kill my vibe, uh (yuh)
If she slide
Then she better be clean like Tide, uh (yuh)
Laundry, detergent (detergent)
I'ma get up in that body like a surgeon (ouu)
Pussy wetter than a damn sea urchin (ouu)
Denzel be a fuckin' legend like urban (yeah)
Legendary shit, you on your secondary shit
I'm on my YesJulz mixed wit' Katy Perry shit (woo)
White on white, while I'm on this beat
Make a masterpiece like Mona Lisa
Shout out to the reaper, I drop ether
Drop mo' crack than eggs on Easter
I don't need a feature, boy you either
Leave it to me, but you leave it to beaver
Killin' these niggas like shots on the evil
I am a god nigga, call me young shiva
Look at the testament, better than ever been
Makin' an estimate for all my pay (okay)
Run like a Mexican, servin' the rest of it
Buyin' a resident on a new day (okay)
In a new house with the same girl
But she got a new blouse (uh huh)
Pussy runnin' to me, but I ain't no mouse (uh huh)
Curry be on point like a motherfucking joust yuh, yuh
Lemme turn into a Super Saiyan real quick
Kill shit, kill shit, my navy seal shit

[Chorus]
Super Saiyan, nah
Curry got the hair like a Super Saiyan, yuh, uh
You the man, nah
Pockets lookin' fatter than the Buddha man, yuh, uh
Ricky Tan, uh
All my kicks fly like I'm Jackie Chan, uh, yuh
Nigga playin', uh
Show these niggas how to fuckin' make a band, uh, uh
Super Saiyan, nah
Curry got the hair like a Super Saiyan, yuh, uh
You the man, nah
Pockets lookin' fatter than the Buddha man, yuh, uh
Ricky Tan uh
All my kicks fly like I'm Jackie Chan, uh, yuh
Nigga playin', uh
Show these niggas how to fuckin' make a band, uh, uh

[Outro]
(Yuh!)

AHHHHHHH!
