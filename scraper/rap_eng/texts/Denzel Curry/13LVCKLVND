[Chorus: Denzel Curry]
Man that flow is mean, yuh
Yea she's in my jeans, yuh
Yo you not a king I'll send you to the guillotine, yuh
All you niggas green, yuh
I'ma make a scene, yuh
Yo you half a man I shoulda called you Charlie Sheen, yuh
Man that flow is mean, yuh
Yea she's in my jeans, yuh
Yo you not a king I'll send you to the guillotine, yuh
All you niggas green, yuh
I'ma make a scene, yuh
Yo you half a man I shoulda called you Charlie Sheen, yuh

[Verse 1: Ghostemane]
Fuckin' up a scene
I'ma mean mothafucker no lean in my cup I'm straight
Mane with a white mane but a blackmage on the way on the way to space
Kicking it with Heavens Gate
Call me Yung Manson kidnapping a bitch to get a ransom
Make her commit a murder, no blood on my hands
I'm biting on the tip of my Beretta
Spittin' no filler
With Curry tha killa
Ain't nobody realer
I'm catching no feelings
2018 I'm signing no deal
I took my bitch to Hawaii
And almost got bombed by Kim Jon
I'm ready to die in paradise
I got no will to go on

[Chorus: Denzel Curry]
Man that flow is mean, yuh
Yea she's in my jeans, yuh
Yo you not a king I'll send you to the guillotine, yuh
All you niggas green, yuh
I'ma make a scene, yuh
Yo you half a man I shoulda called you Charlie Sheen, yuh
Man that flow is mean, yuh
Yea she's in my jeans, yuh
Yo you not a king I'll send you to the guillotine, yuh
All you niggas green, yuh
I'ma make a scene, yuh
Yo you half a man I shoulda called you Charlie Sheen, yuh

[Verse 2: Denzel Curry]

[Chorus: Denzel Curry]
Man that flow is mean, yuh
Yea she's in my jeans, yuh
Yo you not a king I'll send you to the guillotine, yuh
All you niggas green, yuh
I'ma make a scene, yuh
Yo you half a man I shoulda called you Charlie Sheen, yuh
Man that flow is mean, yuh

Yo you not a king I'll send you to the guillotine, yuh
All you niggas green, yuh
