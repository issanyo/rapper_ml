Ready to get that smoke, ready to get that smoke
Smoke in my lungs
Ready to get that smoke, ready to get that smoke
Smoke in my lungs
Ready to get that smoke, ready to get that smoke
Smoke in my lungs
Ready to get that smoke, ready to get that smoke
Smoke in my lungs
Ready to get that smoke, ready to get that smoke
Smoke in my lungs
Ready to get that smoke, ready to get that smoke
Smoke in my lungs
Ready to get that smoke, ready to get that smoke
Smoke in my lungs
Ready to get that smoke, ready to get that smoke
Smoke in my lungs

[Verse 1]
Still pouring liquor for my niggas
That's Chinaman and Tiara
Moments play back in my mental about the last night of terror
Am I scared of dying, more of a bullet flying
Enter my window and hittin' my kinfolk, sit back with a blunt and Iâ€™m sighing, bored
I hear niggas knocking at the door
Talking about some crucial shit like cascade
This shit is war round these parts
Is on your porch even at the park
Shooting your bloods and your nigs out the dark
Then they jump out and ?
13 round from the sound of the chopper
Guaranteed dropper
Go on and let the hammer bang
Like Bob the Builder they fix it and rang
AK-47, 30 second to 47, fill it up with Mac-11s
Eating church's chicken reverend
Z-3 Z-4, River City, Lake Lucerne
Scott Lake, Rolling Oats, ODH still making you turn
Myrtle Grove, what it be
And it's still free Chelly Skee
Let's go get em
Let's go get em
Let's go get em
Let's go get em

[Hook]
Ready to get that smoke, ready to get that smoke
Smoke in my lungs
Ready to get that smoke, ready to get that smoke
Smoke in my lungs
Ready to get that smoke, ready to get that smoke
Smoke in my lungs
Ready to get that smoke, ready to get that smoke
Smoke in my lungs
Ready to get that smoke, ready to get that smoke
Smoke in my lungs
Ready to get that smoke, ready to get that smoke
Smoke in my lungs
Ready to get that smoke, ready to get that smoke
Smoke in my lungs
Ready to get that smoke, ready to get that smoke
Smoke in my lungs
