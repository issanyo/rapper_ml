[Intro]
Ultimate, ultimate, ultimate, ultimate, yeah

[Verse 1: Denzel Curry]
Welcome to the cellar, propelled into a realm
So then you meet me at the helm
Like Del, so you could know that I'm funky as ever
Like Zero, the pain is down to hill, my brain is made of steel
I crash into your soldiers like bricks thrown by Shaquille O'Neal
The coldest flow in the snow globe, my nigga, I'm lost in frost
I never went to college, don't even listen to Asher Roth
Sometimes I'm a butterfly, most times I feel like a moth
Kill my insecurities because they tried to make me soft
Kill off, you and your posse, if you cross me
Have you so shook you wouldn't even want to cross streets
Pardon me, niggas be, Madison Square guardin' me
You could be a statue and you still won't be as hard as me
Fuck the industry, I only worry about my artistry
Hard to see, RIP my older brother Lotto Tree
Dawg, I'm murdering everything inside my allegory
Come back from the dead, I'll smack you to purgatory

[Chorus: Denzel Curry]
Because you cannot fuck with Zeltron 6 Bill-ion!
You lookin' at my zoom, my shit is Sicil-ian!
Y'all lookin' at my bitch, my bitch is Brazil-ian!
I'm finna run through to the city and kill shit!
Because you cannot fuck with Zeltron 6 Bill-ion!
You lookin' at my zoom, my shit is Sicil-ian!
Y'all lookin' at my bitch, my bitch is Brazil-ian!
I'm finna run through to the city and kill shit!

[Verse 2: Lil Ugly Mane]
Who else but Ugly Mane and Zel could rock it so funky as hell?
We got it locked like a prison, got 'em twistin' on them D's watching
Speaking facts like 360 degrees drop it
Wisdom, you think you mobbin' but you isn't
Miami back to Richmond back to Cali
They gon' find your body in the alley
Ugly still the ugliest, Ugly still destructive
I'ma lay you down underneath the ground if you fuck with this
Head up in the clouds when the dutch is lit, puffin' it
I be acting foul for the fuck of it
Lately it's a lot of days I feel hopeless (fuck it)
It's a lot of days I'm feeling like I'm drowning in the ocean
Put your hands on me and your hands gettin' broken
When I hit the scene, it's like a goddamn explosion
Find me out surrounded by some shooters, they be young and old
Piffing looking crispy I got origami money folds
Ugly Mane, bars played, that blood in my veins be running cold
Running the game I be unopposed, short fuse, don't cut it close
Ugly Mane, bars played, that shit I spit be so morose
You better watch your mouth playa, I hit you with that lethal dose

[Chorus: Denzel Curry]
Because you cannot fuck with Zeltron 6 Bill-ion!
You lookin' at my zoom, my shit is Sicil-ian!
Y'all lookin' at my bitch, my bitch is Brazil-ian!
I'm finna run through to the city and kill shit!
Because you cannot fuck with Zeltron 6 Bill-ion!
You lookin' at my zoom, my shit is Sicil-ian!
Y'all lookin' at my bitch, my bitch is Brazil-ian!
I'm finna run through to the city and kill shit!
