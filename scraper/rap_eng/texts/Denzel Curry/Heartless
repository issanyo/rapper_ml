[Intro]
Boop boop boop boop boop boop
Bap bap bap blap blap, brrap, brrap

[Verse]
My gun got diarrhea when it boop boop boop boop boop
Y'all niggas with that barking shit, that woo woo woo woo woo
Do you hear the 1 to 44, double 22?
Hold on, let me slow it down, R.I.P. DJ Screw, ooh
Niggas be thinking they real niggas, niggas be thinking they shining
Niggas be thinking they diamonds, my niggas movin' in silence
You niggas don't want a war, I lay you down with the dinosaurs
Bitch I am a Megazord, in the streets you do not win awards
I'm high as a hoverboard, I don't compute like a motherboard
I eat like a carnivore, none of you niggas prepared for war
This ain't what you heard before, roll up the green like a herbivore
This ain't what you heard before, roll up the green like a herbivore
Like Jordan you stay with the bullshit
My nigga I'm done with the nonsense
My nigga I'm outta my conscience
I'm throwin' my brain out the window
A whole bunch of kush and some indo
I'm bout to roll up with my kinfolk
With all of the things that I seen
It's looking just like what Bush wrote
Roll it up, smoke it up and put it through the glass pipe
Fuck around with me, this'll probably be your last night
First time she saw me, it will probably be her last time
When she call me back, I'ma tell her it's a bad time

[Chorus]
I do not talk shit, I'd rather just start shit
Out of my starship, I slept with a goddess
Out of the darkness, I feel like a goblin
I am so heartless, I'm feeling so heartless
I am so heartless, why am I so heartless?
I am so heartless, why am I so heartless?
I am so heartless, why am I so heartless?
I am so heartless, why am I so heartless? Yeah!
