[Hook: Denzel Curry]
No pen no pad
Moving round the city like a nomad
Gotta be on point like a gnome hat
Gotta leave the place where im known at
Now a nigga never wanna go back
Broke niggas ask where the dough at
Old niggas ask where the hoes at
Got these nuts, nigga hold that
No pen no pad
Moving round the city like a nomad
Gotta be on point like a gnome hat
Gotta leave the place where im known at
Now a nigga never wanna go back
Broke niggas ask where the dough at
Old niggas ask where the hoes at
Got these nuts, nigga hold that

[Verse 1: Denzel Curry]
From the dirt got it up out the mud, huh
Bitch Im'ma ball, balling like I'm Elmer Fudd, uh
You took a L, minute that you took a dub, uh
So you my bro, nigga we was never blood,huh
I be the shit like a diaper
Staying in a cut like I'm scythe
Curry the killer, then nigga I kill anybody when I'm in the cypher
Call a nigga, DC sniper
I don't want to be you either
These niggas say I'm the future,  Mekhi Phifer
Do it so easily these niggas don' want to see me on DVD, oh
I got the energy most of you niggas don't have a identity, oh
I got the buzz lightyear gun beyond to infinity, yuh
Most of you niggas is lost might as well call you virginity yo
Fuck a rap name
Fuck a rap chain
Fuck the whole game, impregnate
Abort my kids upon her face
Fuck a new bitch in the next day
It's not about you
It's not about god
It's not about race, Tay-k
Why the devil gonna hate
Leave a nigga chalked outline trace, so okay

[Hook: Denzel Curry]
No pen no pad
Moving round the city like a nomad
Gotta be on point like a gnome hat
Gotta need a price, loan that
Ya'll nigga don't wanna go back
Broke niggas ask where the dough at
Old niggas ask where the hoes at
Got these nuts, nigga hold that
No pen no pad
Moving round the city like a nomad
Gotta be on point like a gnome hat
Gotta need a price, loan that
Ya'll nigga never wanna go back
Broke niggas ask where the dough at
Old niggas ask where the hoes at
Got these these nuts, nigga hold that
