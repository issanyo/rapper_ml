[Pre-Chorus: J.K. The Reaper]
What you 'bout to do?
Bitch, I think I'm Terry
I don't chase no pussy or no rats, no Tom & Jerry
You niggas is scary
And I think it's hilarious
Bitch, I'm underwater drinking air, an Aquarius
Bitch, I’m an Aquarius
So you know I'm wavy
You are not my homie
So I know you shady
It's a slim chance that I know you gon' play me
Bitches want the cocaine like we in the 80s

[Chorus: Denzel Curry]
Shhhh!
Tell the pussy keep quiet
I don’t wanna hear no noise, keep it dead silent
Ahhhh!
Tell the pussy keep quiet
I don’t wanna hear no noise, keep it dead silent
Ahhhh!
Tell the pussy keep quiet
Ahhhh!
Tell the pussy keep quiet
Ahhhh!
Tell the pussy keep quiet
I don’t wanna hear no noise, keep it dead silent

[Verse 1: Nyyjerya]
Bitch, I peeped your game
You was never on my team
You just sending for the ring
But how you gonna ball with me if you can't feel the pain?
I step up in the paint
You see crazy [?]
Never in the main
Watch out for my rain
I make it flood, tidal waves
I’m on TIDAL, so I’m paid
Don’t think I got it made
My life an everyday struggle, and I never had a maid
You the help, you my slave
Bow down to the infamous empress
Known for dethroning you niggas who thought your threats was imminent
Fuck niggas send shots through the Internet
When I pull up on your block, it’s no doubt I’m ending that

[Pre-Chorus: J.K. The Reaper]
What you 'bout to do?
Bitch, I think I'm Terry
I don't chase no pussy or no rats, no Tom & Jerry
You niggas is scary
And I think it's hilarious
Bitch, I'm underwater drinking air, an Aquarius
Bitch, I’m an Aquarius
So you know I'm wavy
You are not my homie
So I know you shady
It's a slim chance that I know you gon' play me
Bitches want the cocaine like we in the 80s

[Chorus: Denzel Curry]
Shhhh!
Tell the pussy keep quiet
I don’t wanna hear no noise, keep it dead silent
Ahhhh!
Tell the pussy keep quiet
I don’t wanna hear no noise, keep it dead silent
Ahhhh!
Tell the pussy keep quiet
Ahhhh!
Tell the pussy keep quiet
Ahhhh!
Tell the pussy keep quiet
I don’t wanna hear no noise, keep it dead silent

[Verse 2: Yoshi Thompkins]
Keep that shit down to a minimum
Mimic me, you just a mini-me
Don’t take my energy
I’m feeling [?]
You always talk ‘bout what you finna be
Without no action, make it happen
No more fooling me, I’m fool on [?]
Man, Boynton Beach
[?], I got that tool on me
So special, she step away, they don’t wanna [?]
They send them straight to me
I answer when I’m fucking needed
Never felt more live, I’m with the stars, [?]
Hold up, now breathe in, breathe in
Breathe out, press your buttons like Beemo
Just to see what you be ‘bout
We really savage
Yeah, that’s what we be ‘bout
Fuck a bitch in the treehouse
Sit on my face, treat my dick like a seesaw
Go up and down, go up and down
Catch a nut, then I be out
Kick a bitch out her own house

[Pre-Chorus: J.K. The Reaper]
What you 'bout to do?
Bitch, I think I'm Terry
I don't chase no pussy or no rats, no Tom & Jerry
You niggas is scary
And I think it's hilarious
Bitch, I'm underwater drinking air, an Aquarius
Bitch, I’m an Aquarius
So you know I'm wavy
You are not my homie
So I know you shady
It's a slim chance that I know you gon' play me
Bitches want the cocaine like we in the 80s

[Chorus: Denzel Curry]
Shhhh!
Tell the pussy keep quiet
I don’t wanna hear no noise, keep it dead silent
Ahhhh!
Tell the pussy keep quiet
I don’t wanna hear no noise, keep it dead silent
Ahhhh!
Tell the pussy keep quiet
Ahhhh!
Tell the pussy keep quiet
Ahhhh!
Tell the pussy keep quiet
I don’t wanna hear no noise, keep it dead silent

[Outro: J.K. The Reaper]
It's U season, motherfucker
I know y'all niggas looking at this right now
You really hurt, I get it
My mother didn't raise no fool
You shouldn't take a picture, nigga
You shouldn't take a picture, nigga
When we invited you to the party
You should have showed up
You can't show up no more
I’ll slap the taste out your lips
Give it back to your moms
Put that shit in a fucking present
And put it under a Christmas tree
Bitch, because that is all you get
A gang of spit!
Fuck outta here!
Your shit’s not popping, nigga
Sit down!
I’m calling out the stupid nigga who tried to do the diddy bop in the middle of the circle
Everybody thought you were tight
That was back in high school
Not anymore!
Game over!
Nigga, you look like Pac-Man
Fuck outta here
