[Intro]
Ronny J, listen up

[Verse: Denzel Curry]
I be the Aquarius!
I spit out aquariums
Mediterranean, bitch I'm, an alien
I'm Native American, rollin' up, sharin' it
Bitch, I am arrogant
Hazardous when I spit Darius
Savage, but I'm the protagonist
All of y'all leaders sip Actavis, mixed with the Xanax
Control it, no Janet
That shit is like Xanax
So, bitch, I can't stand it
I'll mail it and stab it, put guts on your canvas
Then off to the Hamptons
Nigga, I feel like Fred Hampton
Bitch, I'm reppin' the mushroom planet
I put my soul on the canvas
You can peg it on a panoramic
Boy, I'ma shoot it from a vantage point
Now you damaged, boy
Ultimately, I will Eagleton your lawn
You ain't on what I'm on
Pull up beat by Saigon
You with Lucifer, I don't lose so far
From a galaxy that's way afar
That's far away, that's hard to say
Who's hard to kill me, who's got the, ayy

[Chorus: Denzel Curry]
Beyond triflin', I'm psychic
I'm the man, motherfucker, I'm lightning
Tryna clash with a motherfuckin' titan
Denzel drag 'em to the river like a Pisces (woof)
I'm icy, she feisty
I'm the man, motherfucker, I'm lightning
She a shone but you might call her wifey
C9 make the good girls get hyphy
Beyond triflin', I'm psychic
I'm the man, motherfucker, I'm lightning
Tryna clash with a motherfuckin' titan
Denzel drag 'em to the river like a Pisces (woof)
I'm icy, she feisty
I'm the man, motherfucker, I'm lightning
She a shone but you might call her wifey
C9 make the good girls get hyphy
