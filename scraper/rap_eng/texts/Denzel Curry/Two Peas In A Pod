[Chorus]
Lajan in the kitchen whipping curry
Then it must be with denzel
Two spoons too cool to make a move
They gon' swear at my nigga denzel
Two peas in the pot, watch 'em [?]
(two peas in the pot)
Like how the hell did you get it ?
(how the hell did you get it ?)
Don't worry, be cool, we was focused
(we was focused)
Motherfucker this is [?]
(2x)

[Verse 1: Lajan Slim]
Two bad bitches is how I give
Lost in the [?] Denzel
[?]
And I'm fresh like I'm Prince, [?] from Bel-Air
We came out the project, so let's address the topic
Took a L when [?] daddy wasn't around
On the road of riches, looking like [?]

[Chorus]
Lajan in the kitchen whipping curry
Then it must be with denzel
Two spoons too cool to make a move
They gon' swear at my nigga denzel
Two peas in the pot, watch 'em [?]
(two peas in the pot)
Like how the hell did you get it ?
(how the hell did you get it ?)
Don't worry, be cool, we was focused
(we was focused)
Motherfucker this is [?]
(2x)


[Verse 2:Denzel Curry]
In the kitchen whipping curry, mix the steph on
Better keep your eyes on me and lajan
I be the nigga that you might rely on
Won't be the nigga that you will lie on
Phone myself, I keep it beside myself
Stuck and lost I need to find myself
Fendi, Prada and that Gucci belt
Anything for a nigga's wealth
Back when the club had a hole in the wall
Young gook ass nigga who was destined to ball
Fcuk y'all [?]
[?]
Living up like a heaven
Flame on, Chris
It's lit bitch merry Christmas
From the misfit, fuck your interests [?]

[Chorus]
Lajan in the kitchen whipping curry
Then it must be with denzel
Two spoons too cool to make a move
They gon' swear at my nigga denzel
Two peas in the pot, watch 'em [?]
(two peas in the pot)
Like how the hell did you get it ?
(how the hell did you get it ?)
Don't worry, be cool, we was focused
(we was focused)
Motherfucker this is [?]
(2x)
