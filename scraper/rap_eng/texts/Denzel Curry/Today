[Intro: Allan Kingdom]
I think I paid my dues, I think I lift my cup
I think my rent is due, I think I'll get high
Window shopping, couldn't cop, no boycott
Leggo see what's at the top, no toy block
Them boys got toys and still I don't even got a deal
I think I'll get high

[Verse 1: Denzel Curry]
I like my currency lucrative, my words are provocative
I say what I say cause what I say is my prerogative
I stay positive as if I was terminally ill
I could imagine having a friend but that never was real
Lemonheads only using me for the limelight
Looking at my wrist, they reveal themselves when the time's right
When it's said and done, I can only see it in hindsight
Pull a Fetty Wap on these niggas and give a blind eye
I don't rock fake shit or fight soft niggas
I try to unite all my brothers cause I lost niggas
I got Nell and Slikk back so now I kick back
Only thing I pray for is Mookie to get his jit back
What's up?
Got my nigga Boogie in the front, nigga what's up?
Hop out, do my motherfuckin' stuff, nigga what's up?
Girl I ain't rich, just a nigga on the come up
Grindin' 'til the sun up, believe that

[Hook: Allan Kingdom]
I'm doin' what I want today (doin' what I want)
I'm movin' how I want today
I'm steady doin' what I want today (movin' how I want)
And I been losin' but I won today

[Verse 2: Boogie]
I got to stop and see the signs, man a lot been on my mind
All this hurling from this vodka mixed with wine, uh
Tryna get a spot, I seen my mama get declined
And then my chakras got aligned, niggas plottin' on my spine, oh shit
Old backstabbin', all day hashtaggin'
Lazy don't suit me nigga, see it when I start slackin'
I learned to see the bigger picture when they start flashing
Got it depicted to the pixel, you just all captions
Oh shit, I feel enriched from my misfortune
Just know that talkin' gotta chill if you bench-warming
Just know the groupie getting blocked before she ever get to score
No you just a rebound, I only hit you when I'm bored
You only wit' me for the come up
Got my nigga Curry in the front, nigga what's up?
Hop out, do my motherfuckin' stuff, nigga what's up?
Drugs got a nigga moon walkin' 'til the sun up, believe that

[Hook: Allan Kingdom]
I'm doin' what I want today (doin' what I want)
I'm movin' how I want today
I'm steady doin' what I want today (movin' how I want)
And I been losin' but I won today

[Outro: Allan Kingdom]
Doin' what I want, doin' what I want
Movin' how I want, movin' how I want
Doin' what I want, movin' how I want
