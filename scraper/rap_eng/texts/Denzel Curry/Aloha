[Lyrics From Snippet]

[Intro]
He's heating up
Good-good-good-good Work Charlie
Women love

[Chorus]
[?] like aloha
[?] like aloha
[?] like aloha
[?] like aloha
[?] like aloha

[Verse]
Give a nigga brain like Oklahoma
When a nigga hit call Jehova
All up in the throat like Ricola
Shorty wanna ride like Winona (He is snapping)
Now your boyfriend is a loner (Aye)
Loser, loser
Now I'm a bit cooler, cooler
Every a nigga get newer, newer
People talking shit like manure
Nigga, so what's up?
I'm raw, I'm rich

[Chorus]
[?] like aloha
[?] like aloha
[?] like aloha
[?] like aloha
[?] like aloha
