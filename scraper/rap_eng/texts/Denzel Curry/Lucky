[Chorus: Leaf]
I don't even wanna be around you
Should've took you back to the place the bitch found you
Boy you lucky that you even got a fuckin' round two
Ooh you lucky that my energy even surround you, baby
I'm hustlin' and movin' just tryna bring home all this money
For you (for you), I been stacking these hunnids
But this money it don't mean nothin' without you (without you)

[Verse 1: J.K. The Reaper]
I don't need nobody in the end
And I told you that I loved you
When you should've been a friend
And I know that you're afraid
And I know you can't pretend
And I should've won a Oscar
How I act up in this bitch
You couldn't play your role
So I cut you out the script
You couldn't love me at my lows
I get high with another bitch
You could stay with that other dude
'Cause this million dollar dick
I put dollar signs on that pussy
And I cash out and I di- di- dip
How you keep a straight face when you telling lies?
I ain't the only one wrong, girl tell me why?
I keep my purple heart on me like an army tie
I just hope you can move on and find a better life

[Chorus: Leaf]
I don't even wanna be around you
Should've took you back to the place the bitch found you
Boy you lucky that you even got a fuckin' round two
Ooh you lucky that my energy even surround you, baby
I'm hustlin' and movin' just tryna bring home all this money
For you (for you), I been stacking these hunnids
But this money it don't mean nothin' without you (without you)

[Verse 2: Denzel Curry]
Girl acting like she famous
Sing a nigga las like vegas
Big body whips like magus
Riding around the city like I'm Ronald Reagan
You singing that I'm worthless
Middle fingers up in all your curses
At first, they called us perfect
Now every time we fight it's versus
Like Scorpion and Sub-Zero
One thing hurtin' is your ego
She gon' say I'm lying like a motherfuckin' Leo
Jesus pieces on my heart had left it cold as frio
So sick of these love songs
Now it's time to ball like Ne-yo
You were the one for me
Everything looking so ugly
Remember us living comfortably?
Now you don't wanna be under me
Deep in the pussy, I'm under sea
Baby girl used to be lovely
I was the person you want to see
Now I don't want you to fuck with me, ayy

[Chorus: Leaf]
I don't even wanna be around you
Should've took you back to the place the bitch found you
Boy you lucky that you even got a fuckin' round two
Ooh you lucky that my energy even surround you, baby
I'm hustlin' and movin' just tryna bring home all this money
For you (for you), I been stacking these hunnids
But this money it don't mean nothin' without you (without you)
