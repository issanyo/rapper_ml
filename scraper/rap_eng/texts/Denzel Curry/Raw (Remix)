[Verse 1: Daye Jack]
I'm the nigga came up cold
All the shit they must atone
Let my enemies yell at me, hobby for the young bro
It's a tragedy when someone black as me get gold
Time to slaughter, street fighter fist, that's Nintendo
Told my alma mater gotta send me money, Venmo
Put us on map, don't sleep, siesta, man blow
Jack won't be no nigga serenading with a banjo
Real reckless dude with a crew carry ammo
I predicted winning would be something so taboo
But now I'm monkeying around with my brothers, baboons
Atlanta in Hollywood, it's on schedule
Chef in the bank, been eatin', check my dental
Plenty sugar, suite life, kicked it in the penthouse
My sheets all green, they don't knit me a bando
And a nice sweater too, fit seen levels
Floating here shining, I need me a drum roll

[Chorus: Daye Jack]
I'm too raw, raw, raw, I'm a villain, I'm a don
Mask and a cape, somebody ring the alarm
Wild boy, boy, boy, can't tame me, nah
Started that flame, somebody ring the alarm
I'm too raw, raw, raw, I'm a villain, I'm a don
Mask and cape, somebody ring the alarm
Wild boy, boy, boy, can't tame me, nah
Started that flame, somebody ring the alarm

[Verse 2: DP]
Stumbled in the function, all black like Keaton
Ready to deck a nigga, I'm just looking for a reason
I been done leaped off the deep end
Been the one, ate all these niggas that wouldn't feed him
And he serving raw cuts like red veal
And only attending school to sell pills
His red scale only see him when his bread near
And he'll kill if you try to interfere, aye
Now plottin' on heists over twenty million
I'm scouting like the black Pat Gillick
From the land where they killing they landlords 'fore the rent due
And common issues lead to firearm misuse
Only lie to the judge and the federales
I'm only hoping I get this bond from the magistrate
My mama hoping I'll abandon my cancerous ways
I'm sick mama, this cancer's here to stay

[Chorus: Daye Jack]
I'm too raw, raw, raw, I'm a villain, I'm a don
Mask and a cape, somebody ring the alarm
Wild boy, boy, boy, can't tame me, nah
Started that flame, somebody ring the alarm
I'm too raw, raw, raw, I'm a villain, I'm a don
Mask and a cape, somebody ring the alarm
Wild boy, boy, boy, can't tame me, nah
Started that flame, somebody ring the alarm

[Verse 3: Denzel Curry]
Wanna see a black man ball, Boris Kodjoe
See a monkey with a brain, yeah I be the Mojo
JoJo, said it was guerilla warfare
Tried to box me in like a game of four square
Stripped me of my rights and leave me beat in a coma
Had me diggin' my own grave like I'm Shia LaBeouf
You see it, repeated
They wanna see all my people depleted
Say we anemic then they give us the pill with diseases
Then pledge allegiance to the almighty legion
Bald eagle soarin' over my dead region
All seeing eye, you can see what you never saw
Would say I'm real but I'll tell you that

[Chorus: Daye Jack]
I'm too raw, raw, raw, I'm a villain, I'm a don
Mask and a cape, somebody ring the alarm
Wild boy, boy, boy, can't tame me, nah
Started that flame, somebody ring the alarm
I'm too raw, raw, raw, I'm a villain, I'm a don
Mask and a cape, somebody ring the alarm
Wild boy, boy, boy, can't tame me, nah
Started that flame, somebody ring the alarm
