[Verse : Denzel Curry]
Aye, you broke, boy, your money foldin'
Zero's fall around the semicolon
[?] when a nigga put his golds in
Go in, I'ma go ten, like go Goten
I'm out of this orbit, like bad breath
She suck on my dick, it look mad, bruh
Your wallets your only cash left
I hit her ass right then her ass left
Bitch, I don't need to go to the mall
Bitch, I ball
[?]
You'll never find another nigga like me in this life
One verse, one round
Everything a nigga say is gold

[Chorus: Desiigner]
