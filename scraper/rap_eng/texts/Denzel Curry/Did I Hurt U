[Verse 1: Steven A. Clark]
You told me you loved me but I never really cared
Can't say I missed you 'cause I was never really there
I was lying every time, each moment that we shared
And yeah the sex was good but your head I couldn't bear
And you're a little bit crazy, so I try to take it slow
But you lied about your boyfriend and you're such a ho
And a little bit crazy, just thought I'd let you know
Then what was I thinking? One thing you gotta know

[Chorus: Steven A. Clark]
Did I hurt you?
Did I hurt you?
Did I hurt you?
Did I hurt you?
Oooh, oooh, huh-huh, huh-huh
Did I hurt you?
Oooh, oooh, huh-huh, huh-huh
'Cause you hurt me too

[Verse 2: Steven A. Clark]
Wouldn't buy you a drink if you were standing by the bar
And you couldn't get the aux cord if you were riding in my car
And I don't know what it is but you are who you are
Then what was I thinking? You're the craziest by far
And thank God we didn't have kids with all the freaky shit we did
'Cause if anybody's asking [?]
[?] never know what you want, man somethings got to give
What I do to deserve this? Man, here we go again

[Chorus: Steven A. Clark]
Did I hurt you?
Did I hurt you?
Did I hurt you?
Did I hurt you?
Oooh, oooh, huh-huh, huh-huh
Did I hurt you?
Oooh, oooh, huh-huh, huh-huh
'Cause you hurt me too

[Verse 3: Denzel Curry]
The key to everything is sharing
You acting like that I'm not caring
The pain in your eyes, I'm staring
I could fuck another bitch and tell you I ran errands
Scumbag, feeling like a dumbass
'Cause I got another bitch that make me cum fast
Thirty minutes in the pussy but it never last
I just want thirty years and a everlasting relationship
I know you can't take this shit in
If I ever let my ego trip in
[?] battleship [?]
Heartbreak kiddo, weeping willow
I don't wanna be the one to come in with a pillow
In my speakerbox you can hear the love below
Now you got a nigga feeling below zero
