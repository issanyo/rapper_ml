[Chorus: Denzel Curry and ZillaKami]
ZXLTRXN and ZillaKami, bitch we back on again
I'm just chillin’ with my dawg, that be my evil twin
[?] cause I don't got a [?]
It's like Silence of the Lambs, [?]
ZXLTRXN and ZillaKami, bitch we back on again
I’m just shootin' with my dawg, that be my evil twin
Never stand tall
Never being called
[?] In hell, with a choppa singing war songs
[Verse 1 Denzel Curry]


Killin' my enemies end of result
You a bitch, your mom's a bitch
Your mom a hoe, and I'm killing you all

[Chorus: Denzel Curry and ZillaKami]
ZXLTRXN and ZillaKami, bitch we back on again
I'm just chillin' with my dawg, that be my evil twin
[?] cause I don't got a [?]
It’s like Silence of the Lambs, [?]
ZXLTRXN and ZillaKami, bitch we back on again
I’m just shootin' with my dawg, that be my evil twin
Never stand tall
Never being called
[?] In hell, with a choppa singing war songs

[Verse 2 ZillaKami]
Cut off
Pocket full of cream, call it Häagen-Dazs [?]
I can make an atheist go "oh my gosh" [Unintelligible]
You ain’t making bread so now you lactose, black bones
Most people say that I'm an asshole, cash hoe

[Chorus: Denzel Curry and ZillaKami]
ZXLTRXN and ZillaKami, bitch we back on again
I'm just chillin' with my dawg, that be my evil twin
[?] cause I don’t got a [?]
It's like Silence of the Lambs, [?]
ZXLTRXN and ZillaKami, bitch we back on again
I'm just shootin' with my dawg, that be my evil twin
Never stand tall
Never being called
[?] In hell, with a choppa singing war songs
