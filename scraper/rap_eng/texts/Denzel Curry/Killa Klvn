[Verse 1: Xavier Wulf]
Bustin' up outta the scene

Comin' up with the cheese
I gotta get off of the streets
Too many [?] that's tryin' me
Yall have to [?] at least three
Don't enter rap with me
Can't you see when I'm at peace
I'm a [?]
But when a sucka fuck with me
I turn killa B
As I be smokin' like a white old lady
Hoes call me baby when I'm in my aunt's Mercedes
Chillin' in the [?], that's the haven when we blaze it
Blaze it like Caucasians in the 80's in Jamaicans
Why the fuck we waitin'? There's the money
Let's go take it
Lil homie just be patient
Clear your mind and we gon' make it

Beat it like a rapist, skeet it, then I left her naked
You shakin', why you shakin'?

[Verse 2: Denzel Curry]
I was raised up on the dark side
Blackland, the Soldier Slim
Gimme the SK, nigga it's gunplay
Go for the head and I go for the limb
Bumpin' K-Rock, be a witness
To mystical killa with style
Kamikaze, killin' the Nazis
Stackin' intestines all up in the *Fatality*
Ethelwulf, with that [?]
Nervously, we killin' 'em B
[?] touchin', you better get [?]
I'm bringin' the gun and I'm bringin' the heat
Yung Raw, grab the gauge
Then [?] killas because our age
Zimmerman, I'm killin' him *gunshot*
Now he's on the first page
Thinkin' I am the one
F that fire, I'ma F that gun
Rippin' [?] kill yo' son, bitch better run
*gunshot* [?] surely you done, *Finish Him*
Stupid ass homos, you into the [?]
A [?] killa like [?] and coco
The monkey, the beast and the nigga
Got [?] And [?] on my dick just like [?] and Jojo
[?] killa, a [?]
She sippin' my saké, I'm doing karate
I bust on your bitch like a ball of bukkake
Nigga I'm [?] off that mystical style
Ethelwulf, Yung Raw, Denzel, that killa klan
And shoutouts the SpaceGhost for givin' us the helping hand

[Verse 3: Yung Raw]
Denzel told me to give him the gauge
I don't play (blap)
The day he disrespected me
The klan had sent him away
The nigga was slain
Can't stand 'em, [?] 'em
Kill 'em all, turn 'em into a phantom
I'm Santa, run in yo' house
I'm [?], smellin' like some loud
You see the dark clouds, East Memphis
[?] was on some pimpin' shit
She tellin' me she lovin' it
So take her to the pyramids
'94 what I'm livin' in
These times are so cripplin'
The [?] because we have to rhyme and kill
So we can meet them ends
Ethelwulf and Denzel, my last name is Curry too
Fuck the government
I got Zimmerman in my fuckin' booth
Tied up like a bitch, Slit the racist nigga throat
Make him eat them waste of skittles and [?] off of Trayvon's coat
Killa klan shit in this Raider band bitch
A child of the corn, can't fuck with legit
I'm the 36 [?] with the 36 flow
Pop off and reload, snitches no mo'
If you wanted some mo', I will give you a dose
Not meaning to boast and shoutout to the Purpp
Best believe you'll get murked, [?]
All black my nigga [?]

Gotta kill, get 'em nowhere to run
Can't get away from my shotgun
Leavin' them bodies fucked up
Pump pump to the ground better leave it alone
Nigga wanna die when fuckin' wid
Mo Thug nigga we killed this bitch
Now you wanna catch some bang bang
Nigga wanna die when I let my nuts hang
What is it in me makes me feel like I gots ta murda ya?
You slip when I’m high, pullin' my ticket, nigga you die, soldier
Four killas we creepin' and comin' to hurt ya, mo murda
Better pack that five five
I'm feelin' like killin' you dying tonite
You don't wanna hear that Glock pop
When the Glock pop pop don't stop
We all about murda mo
Finger on the trigger Mo Thug let go
We straight from Cleveland
Clack back nigga ya bleeding
You don't wanna fuck wid Bone
Pullin' that chrome now nigga ya gone
If you wanna die bye
See you in the gutter let mama cry
Watch Mo Thug Killas pump pump
Put 'em in the ground with his head blown gone
Mo murda, mo murda, mo murda
