[Verse 1: Denzel Curry]
How many niggas is saying they pimping
It's evident when is it none of you niggas got pimp in your blood
All of y'all watered down like a tub full of suds
I cannot fuck with you let me roll up my bud
Girl you look like a dime but can you roll up a dub
Go to the club you said you ain't looking for love
But you dark and lovely and the night was gusting
Marijuana and bubbly now your body I'm lusting
Forever, ever never for the time being
You without clothes is the only thing I'm seeing
Hair swanging you hear what I'm saying
I may be a gook but this time I'm not playing
This conversation was start of creation
Creating a game that was shown to me
Niggas be praising you hoping to play with you
Sorry my dear you're just shone to me

[Hook]
Well it's cool to us if you want to be shown
We'll just blame it on the fact that she just don't know
It's cool cause you are delusional
Cause you know that we know that you are what you are
You're shone

[Verse 2: Twelve'Len]
I respect the ladies
No love for these hoes
Whats the point in fucking bitches
When that shit gets old
Seen it time and time again
The way that you don't know
So I had to switch the game up
It's fuck bitches get dough, ohh
Time for me to settle down
And quit chasing after these skirts
All of these hoes only know what I worth
Yeah I got a girl don't want her to get hurt, mane
Bout to go way back home
Away from the life full of sin
That Billie Jean and a cup of gin
I know you wanna fuck, don't pretend shawty

[Hook]
Well it's cool to us if you want to be shown
We'll just blame it on the fact that she just don't know
It's cool cause you are delusional
Cause you know that we know that you are what you are
You're a shone

[Outro]
No need to
