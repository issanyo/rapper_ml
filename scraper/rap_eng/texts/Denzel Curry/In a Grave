[Show Me the Body]
As a kid, tethering
Thinking bout what my papa did
Crush 'em all and take a sip
Fuck the case, we gettin' lit
Now I see soundly
Daredevil in the [?]
Fucked up, take away
Shaved in a grave, put 'em in a row

[Denzel Curry]
Fucked up, is the life, couldnâ€™t live twice
This the type of shit that could make a jit wrist slice
Eva since the split I never had a bliss night
Was halfway beaten to death could never learn to fist fight
But niggas be
Caught up in they mazes its amazin how a day would age
Put me in the cage because my mind is on another page when my thoughts decay I would go and raise another brain and
Put me in a space, find the freedom in another way

[Eartheater]
Medical without credential
Attention to detail
Pin and needle
You don't need me
You don't need me

[Moor Mother]
Yeah, you're a body with no god
Another human with no hue
Descendants of the bullshit they ask you
New age robots and they teach you to rewire you
And I ain't talking bout the future, dude
My attitude real rude like fuck you
I keep telling you, I keep saying b
But you don't hear me because you're here to kill me
Well let me finish my verse
I got the toaster and the biscuit
You can get the hearse or the hell visited urn
Right before the morning star morning, y'all
Can't fall, no phoenix
Same thesis, which is fuck all y'all
Let it echo from the belly of Hades
Who let it [?] from the early 80's
Yeah, you know Reagan
Return of the Christian pagan (Fuck Reagan)
Next time they start asking, start slaying, start spraying
Drop their fucking heads from the Himalayans
We earned that
Yo, you get a dead cop's heart for that
Platinum plaques, gold chains, yeah all of that
Yeah, keep telling you, I keep saying b
But you don't hear me because you're here to kill me
Well let me finish my verse
