[Hook: Denzel Curry]
Bitch I got too many waves, bitch I got too many ways
Sometimes I’m stuck in my ways, that’s just the way I was raised
Remember back in the day, rockin’ them Trick Daddy braids
Facing a blunt to the face, gotta escape all the hate
Bitch I got too many waves, bitch I got too many ways
Sometimes I’m stuck in my ways, that’s just the way I was raised
Remember back in the day, rockin’ them Trick Daddy braids
Facing a blunt to the face, gotta escape all the hate

[Verse 1: Yoshi Thompkins]
I'm stuck in my ways
Maneuver through shit while you stuck in one place
What the fuck is an obstacle? I went up from a maze
Frankie Beverly, heavenly, everybody just give me the praise
Bow down to the wave lord, send them presi and save yours
For my gat imma save yall, but that's back in the day
I'm a black panther activist, had to miss
School for the meetings on Saturn and outta this world
You are outta your mind, I'm so high in grind mode
Jukin' and vibin' thru life, my life is my ice, nice
Feel like I married my wife, so I hit it more than twice
Immortalized I am more than nice
Even way back in the days was known as I got vice
Gotta get put on the lights or get put on the pavement
Better run for your life
Hard times, hard to reminisce
But I know my future bright
I am the future went back to the future twice
Just to save everybody life, with waves nigga

[Hook: Denzel Curry]
Bitch I got too many waves, bitch I got too many ways
Sometimes I’m stuck in my ways, that’s just the way I was raised
Remember back in the day, rockin’ them Trick Daddy braids
Facing a blunt to the face, gotta escape all the hate
Bitch I got too many waves, bitch I got too many ways
Sometimes I’m stuck in my ways, that’s just the way I was raised
Remember back in the day, rockin’ them Trick Daddy braids
Facing a blunt to the face, gotta escape all the hate

[Verse 2: Denzel Curry]
Too many waves
Too many waves
Using my government name
Stuck in my ways
Sometimes I feel like I'm born a mistake
But you couldn't relate
Cause you can't imitate
Copy dat, you're a clone I'm Jango Fett
Who wanna get it with the murderous set
Kill a motherfucker like a VHS
Cause we don't play so I eject
Going like a free man no Woodcrest
Red light back and infinite access off of my access
Thinking no answers that's an exit
Wait
Nigga that wasn't the exit
There was no message
Flow like a radical leftist
Black as my right and left fist
Bitch uh

[Bridge: Denzel Curry]
People try to change my mind but I’m sorry I decline, got my mind made up, made up hey
Even when the world is fine I sit back and I recline and I never change up, change up, hey

[Hook: Denzel Curry]
Bitch I got too many waves, bitch I got too many ways
Sometimes I’m stuck in my ways, that’s just the way I was raised
Remember back in the day, rockin’ them Trick Daddy braids
Facing a blunt to the face, gotta escape all the hate
Bitch I got too many waves, bitch I got too many ways
Sometimes I’m stuck in my ways, that’s just the way I was raised
Remember back in the day, rockin’ them Trick Daddy braids
Facing a blunt to the face, gotta escape all the hate
