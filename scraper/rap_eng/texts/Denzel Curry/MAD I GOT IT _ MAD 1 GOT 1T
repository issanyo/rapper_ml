[Chorus]
Big cheese pilin' (big cheese pilin')
You speed dialin', you talk shit
But I keep smilin' (I keep smilin')
That's your chick, but not my chick
'Cause she got mileage (she got mileage)
At your head, but not my head
'Cause I drop knowledge (I drop knowledge)
You glad when I never had shit
But mad I got it (mad I got it)

[Verse 1]
Niggas wanna turn their back (spine)
She don't wanna fuck no more (fine)
I'ma be that nigga some day (time, time, time, time, time)
Lost a couple friends along the way (crime)
Even in the end you could never end me
Still in the hood and I still sip tea
When I go in, I'ma go for the win
On point like syringe and it's like that
Living life full of sin, gotta cup full of Hen'
Put my tears in a pen and I write back
Ice pack 'cause my heart, lost
I'm so cold that I Jack, Frost
I'm 'bout be on the upper echelon
Niggas gonna hate on the man that I become

[Chorus]
Big cheese pilin' (big cheese pilin')
You speed dialin', you talk shit
But I keep smilin' (I keep smilin')
That's your chick, but not my chick
'Cause she got mileage (she got mileage)
At your head, but not my head
'Cause I drop knowledge (I drop knowledge)
You glad when I never had shit
But mad I got it (mad I got it)

[Verse 2]
Niggas wanna take my life (stripes)
Police never read my rights (right)
Only wanna fuck me for the fame (hype, hype, hype, hype, hype)
Another rapper hit it in the same (night)
Niggas ain't shit and the hoes ain't loyal
Really gonna hate when they can't destroy you
Then expect the royal treatment
Talkin' slick like it's oil speakin'
Down to earth, 'til my soil weaken
Venomous words, watching the poison leakin'
Bandana on my motherfuckin' face (Face)
.38 on my motherfuckin' waist (Waist)
When you see me better man up
Better make like a roller coaster, put your hands up

[Chorus]
Big cheese pilin' (big cheese pilin')
You speed dialin', you talk shit
But I keep smilin' (I keep smilin')
That's your chick, but not my chick
'Cause she got mileage (she got mileage)
At your head, but not my head
'Cause I drop knowledge (I drop knowledge)

[Bridge]
Mad I got it, mad I got it

[Beat Switch]

[Verse 3]
Hate the government, capital punishment
I keep a heater on my hip, don't need an oven mitt
I'm on some other shit, mind is twisted
I wear this mask every day â€” Stanley Ipkiss
Realistic views, a pessimistic blues
I sing along, who's got me on my crip shit
Lipstick, long kiss from the devil lips
Moonlit, two hits from the cannabis (Mad I got it)
Death knocking at my door, who could it be?
Life not sweet like suit wit' an E
Try to read me, would it be, Stephen King
Big cheese only bring me Misery (Mad I got it)
Insane with no brain, I'm low zane
No fame and no thangs is so strange
Do things that I don't see violent
Stick a nigga up cause I'm mad he got it

[Outro]
Got it, got it
Cause I'm mad he got it, got it
