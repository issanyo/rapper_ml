[Verse 1: Pouya]
Call my homie up
Pick him up, in the pickup truck
Four in the mornin, on top of that it started storming
And we had a ho in the trunk, she drunk as fuck
Dont even know if she breathing but really I dont give a fuck
Cause I already fucked
Passed her to my homie took advantage of her body cause she nothing but a slut
Started trappin, so we drove a little faster
No concern about the po-po, four mo
Blocks already dead, runnin red lights, in a dead night
Not a car in sight, think I might do the whole dash
Red and blue light but I skid on his ass
Hands in the purse and I took all her cash
She won't even know cause she so fucking bad
Then I made a right turn on the street
As we creep
Take a peep through the window
And I see that this car was followin me
But I guess its in my mind
Felt a chill down my spine
As the time rewinds
We stop on the block unlock the door everybody hop out

[Verse 2: SDotBraddy]
Take the whole key out
Until I see that motha fucka
Dressed in all black ski mask choppa hangin out
The motha fuckin window all black vento
The fear read his eyes that told me he was simple
He pointed to shoot the choppa
But lethally I tried to stop him from getting hit by the bullets
My body shot up like a blocka
Three shots pressed through my back
My first shot was a choppa
So I did but that nigga with a choppa yah he slipped
Now this coward up in my face
African-American unfortunately had to be the race
Looked him in his eyes and told him to pull the trigger
That nigga didn't say shit, god damn that fool figured
Go ahead shoot me nigga, my nigga I ain't shit
And you havin second thoughts my nigga you ain't shit
If you gonna take my life, than go ahead and pull the trigger
But you not a cold killer you a lost as nigga

[Verse 3: Denzel Curry]
Ski mask, resembles the fables of Edgar Allan
But a nigga still poor, my piece is still
But the still of the peace means war
Bucks for the love of dinero
Proper when you face east, ever life travel is proper
Get away clean but have you sleeping with Oscar
Thats a Shark Tale
What do I smell, blood, but not piru
Radio plays the deadliest haikus
When I rest and I stumble to the cars dead piss point
Said a needle and a knife and a tech
One to your eye and one to your chest
Might as well blow your heart to your neck, so
Can you see world imma leave a nigga wet [x2]
Now my name is Leroy, Steves about to get my decoy
IndigoB in the back of the pickup
Sticks on deck so why not pick the chick up
Talking bout a niggas hittin links dont get up
Dont give a fuck so nigga its a stick up
Yah nigga its a stick up [x2]

[Outro:]
Ayo, give me yo money, give me yo chain
Nigga give me yo shoes and yo socks my nigga
Three hundred and thirty three times too nigga
If you dont give me yo shit, thats a motha fuckin Glock
Cold bullets all day nigga
Ayo Steve, go get Indigo so we can get the fuck outta here
