Where the fuck is Raider Klan
Raider Klan, Raider Klan
Raider, Raider Klan
Raider Klan, Raider Klan
Raider, Raider Klan
Raider Klan, Raider Klan
Raider, Raider Klan
Raider Klan, Raider Klan

[Verse]
Don't get it twisted [?] them niggas got questions that nigga will die
Aquarius'Killa bro nigga like [?], if nigga want beef a nigga will fly
Fly, just like a picture, go back to begin and I call it the genesis
Let me turn up that Three 6, bumpin' Lord Infamous
66 6 shit, dumb little nigga don't want that
Dope as hell, just like mary jane on a nigga that smoke crack
Snort that white boy but I never been a fan of it
Hard in the paint like campus is
Gotta get green like cannabis
Badest shit, Boosie Bad
Kill a motherfucker with a Gucci bat
Hole in his head, toe tagged
Kill the beat, nigga body [?]
If you duck you still messed up
That ain't gon' help you protect your shit
Niggas think it's over but my name isn't Drake

[Hook]
Raider Klan, Raider Klan
Raider, Raider Klan
Raider Klan, Raider Klan
Raider, Raider Klan
Raider Klan, Raider Klan
Raider, Raider Klan
Raider Klan, Raider Klan bitch
