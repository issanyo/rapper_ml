[Intro: Key Nyata]
Yeah, uh
It's the mothafuckin'...

[Verse 1: Key Nyata]
Well I'm back on the scene
Better than red everything
Gold teeth in my mouth, still look clean
Chasin' one dream, that's a dream about a dollar
We can go dota, I only want her 'til tomorrow
Bringin' that phonk back because you make wanna, wanna, wanna
I wanna smoke some marijuana with cha boi
Bitch you is for the drama
But save it for yo' momma cause nobody want no problem
I just want a bitch with nice round bottom
Drop top whip, but my shoes all autumn
Fee said get em' so I got em'
Rollin' blunts fatter than yo mama
Check like Osama, eatin' Benihana
I just wanna live, live, live, like a baller
Pop, pop, pop, my motherfuckin' collar
Who ya follow? When I hit, I bet she swallow

[Chorus]
Oh, baby, I know you see me shinin'
Money keep on piling'
Got this way from grindin', grindin'
Oh, baby I just want it all
Paintings on my wall
Car phone in my car, car
Oh, baby, I know you see me shinin'
Money keep on piling'
Got this way from grindin', grindin'
Oh, baby I just want it all
Paintings on my wall
Car phone in my car, car

[Verse 2: Denzel Curry]
Well I'm back on the scene, didn't have to use a triple beam
To make sure I stay wealthy, get moolah and live serene
Medulla oblongata projectin' all of my dreams
Escape the only fate that awaits when out of my sleep
Really reality, vanishin' vanity
And your eyes are not meant to be
Get you wetter than manatees, oh please
Give a round of applause to God
The squad lookin' like angels where the devil has broadened my heart
I play a organ donor, skeletons in the closet get amazed by the boner, now I want her forever
Simply I'm like a Nebuchadnezzar
She the queen to my kingdom and yeah she keep my Beretta
In the desert, I turn back the sands of time
In that alcoholic river servin' cocaine lines
I'm runnin' through the city like America's most
You won't know who's in the phantom so consider me ghost
Women suckin' like vampires with they ego they stroke
Prolly catch a heart attack with the weed that I smoke
Tours, I don't feel like a tourist, leader not a tourist
Party with the Mormons, hasta luego outta the mornin', damn!

[Outro: Denzel Curry]
Hasta mañana, señorita dominicana
Crashin' the pussy
Baila La Bamba, off marijuana, tight, anaconda
Oh, baby!
