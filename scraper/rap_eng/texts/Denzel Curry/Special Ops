[Intro]

It’s all about power

[Hook] [Denzel Curry]

Rest in power, it's all about power
Squeeze two lemons together and really all you'll have is sour
Diesel, niggas'll smoke your ass to have the juice
Riding around in an all black coupe
Couple of pigeons that's ready to shoot, shit

[Verse 1]

Yah, me again
Key of defeat that I must condemn
Fallen in the trap that is love again
I hold the key of wealth for men
I have a mission that must be completed before ten
Don’t tell me then and when
All the 44 Glocks and racks stacked in ten
Sharp wits, quick mind, on point like bulletpoint
Dodge a bullet but I’m not bulletproof
Your girl better be waterproof, cuz’ when I wet her up don’t make a countermove
In the drop top(drop top) no need to open up the sunroof
(Ok)
Rich and powerful and wonderful
Gucci, cultural, all my money stacked, structural
Gunpoint, then smoke a joint
The projects, chillin with the homies, Pinnacle Pointe

Rest in power, it's all about power

[Verse 2]

Double cup, seven eleven
Maserati coupes, I’m feelin’ super saiyan (Yah)
These niggas might be onto something
Hol’ up, hate when these newbies start fronting
Blitz and the firestorm
I kill these beats and crash em’ like a thunderstorm
When you fakin’ it takes you long to brainstorm
Fresh rhymes from the vine
Your girl and she like 69
Double cup, seven eleven
Maserati coupes, feeling like super saiyan
I’m on a mission, special ops
Pop a xanax, pop in the drop top
Hands in the air cop
This is my power, my street, my stop

[Outro]

Bitch it’s all about power
