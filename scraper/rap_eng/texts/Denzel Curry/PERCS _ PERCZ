[Verse 1]
Okay! All y'all niggas fu' as fuck!
I'm U-L-T and I don't fuck with you if you ain't us
In me I trust, I turn these niggas into cosmic dust
I'm Loaded Lux with a loaded K, cock back I spray I bust
That player shit, that Raider shit still running through my blood
These brand new niggas took my name
And drug it through the mud
I get the hammer, I be the judge like Dredd
Police judge my dreads
Fuck your favorite artists, make sure they all dead
Shang Tsung, my swag, broke it apart, ran with it
Weak shit, peep shit, stay dark, soul tinted
Fuck around and get your door dented, new flows invented
Shoot shit, Cole Bennett, rap game, don't get it
With these dumbass niggas, and they don't say shit
Sound like "Durr, durr, durr," you like, "Oh, that's lit"
With yo' boof ass hits, "I'ma fuck yo' bitch
I just popped two Xans," Nigga, fuck that shit!

[Chorus]
On Tree, I do not fuck with the percs, I barely fuck with the Earth
On me, industry niggas the worst, actin' like they from the dirt
On me, I do not fuck with the percs, I barely fuck with the Earth
On Tree, all of them niggas I birth, tryna put me in a hearse
On Tree, I do not fuck with the percs, I barely fuck with the Earth
On me, industry niggas the worst, actin' like they from the dirt
On me, I do not fuck with the percs, I barely fuck with the Earth
On Tree, all of them niggas I birth, tryna put me in a-
Yuh, yuh, yuh!

[Verse 2]
Maybe I should go to jail to get my name up
Then get out and show you how to fuck the game up
Keep my name out yo' mouth, keep yo' chain tucked
Keep yo' dame cuffed, I could make her famous
She's a plain slut that loves it in the anus
I should rap about some lean and my diamond cuts
Get suburban white kids to want to hang with us
It's your friendly neighborhood, I don't give a fuck!
Get it straight, I innovate, you ad-libs on a 808
Don't need a tattoo on my face 'cause Denzel is a different race
I don't even try to hate, I'm just saying what I ain't
People sleeping on me hard and I'm the hardest in the paint
Eight years in the game and I never rode a wave
I may be overlooked, but I'm never underpaid
And when I win a Grammy I'ma take it back to Dade
You signing to a label where they treat you like a slave

[Chorus]
On Tree, I do not fuck with the percs, I barely fuck with the Earth
On me, industry niggas the worst, actin' like they from the dirt
On me, I do not fuck with the percs, I barely fuck with the Earth
On Tree, all of them niggas I birth, tryna put me in a hearse
On Tree, I do not fuck with the percs, I barely fuck with the Earth
On me, industry niggas the worst, actin' like they from the dirt
On me, I do not fuck with the percs, I barely fuck with the Earth
On Tree, all of them niggas I birth, tryna put me in a-

[Outro]
Finish him Zel, finish him Zel
Only pie niggas hate, that's why I stay to myself
Because I always must elevate
Only pie niggas hate, that's why I stay to myself
Because I always must elevate
Only pie niggas hate, that's why I stay to myself
Because I always must elevate
Only pie niggas hate, that's why I stay to myself
Because I always must elevate
Finish him Zel, finish him Zel
