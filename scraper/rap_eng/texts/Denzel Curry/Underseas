[Intro]
Fucking with them niggas got me, ay
Fucking with them niggas got your mind gone
Fucking with these drugs got my eyes low
Fucking with them niggas got your mind gone
Fucking with these drugs got my eyes low

[Verse 1]
Aye, I stay away from bitches that be insecure
I be wildin' out in public, say I'm immature
Bitch you poor, fell asleep on the ceiling, woke up on the floor
If you want, I ain't afraid to die so we can go to war (Go to war)
I ain't afraid to die, so we can go to war (Go to war)
I ain't afraid to die, so we can go to war
My new name is Sally SueI, I made a bedroom out a back seat
Put a back hand to her ass cheek, leave her mad weak, met her last week
Spit mad heat, bucket hat lost so I can't see but it feel good
When she feel me do you feel me fill a cup with that feel good
No, I can't speak Good head, left a nigga dead
So she ridin' with a ghost
My name Casper but never been this friendly
I can only run my city but the whole world looks tempting
Say you puttin' a gram in the swisher but that blunt look fucking empty
Quit fucking with me nigga and a lot of these women are simple
So they fall for simple niggas so I put it simply, fuck with me

[Chorus]
Fucking with them niggas got your mind gone
Fucking with these drugs got my eyes low
Fucking with them niggas got your mind gone
Fucking with these drugs got my eyes low
Fucking with them niggas got your mind gone
Fucking with these drugs got my eyes low
Fucking with them niggas got your mind gone
Fucking with these drugs got my eyes low

Low, low, set my eyes low
Low, low, set my eyes low
Low, low, set my eyes low
Low, low, set my eyes low
