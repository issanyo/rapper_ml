[Verse]
Anti-American, I'm pro Assata
Write rhymes like a scholar, all about a dollar
Dollar equals Allah, put away the scouters
You won't see my power, this your final hour
On Nefertiti, this is for the city
Cut throat, you shouldn't fuck with my committee
Kill it, call it Kenny, say it came from Diddy
All you other rappers hella Pooh, no Winnie
Eeny, meeny, miney, moe, tic-tac-toe
Leave a XO on a death note I wrote
Flow on a back stroke in my black clothes
I'm a asshole, got ghost out the atmos
Fear me
Departed them now they fear me
You want a war, bring the gear please
Murdering everyone yearly, sincerely, ultimate

[Chorus]
They wanna scan on my wrist
My whole life been at risk, make a plan for my jit shit
Look at the time on my wrist
Make a play so legit on my hate government shit
They wanna scan on my wrist
My whole life been at risk, make a plan for my jit shit
Look at the time on my wrist
Make a play so legit on my hate government shit
They wanna scan on my wrist
My whole life been at risk, make a plan for my jit shit
Look at the time on my wrist
Make a play so legit on my hate government shit
They wanna scan on my wrist
My whole life been at risk, make a plan for my jit shit
Look at the time on my wrist
Make a play so legit on my hate government shit
