(Bitch!)

[Verse 1: Denzel Curry]
Polygon, no one can stop me
I stay connected, fuck a Octagon
Smokin' on gasoline
Its about to be a marathon
Carry on, carry on
I'mma touch it, No Omarion
Rockin' vintage Stereon
Call me dookie marion the third
Smokin' a pound of herb
Over the universe, while I'm embracin' the earth
Anything else I prefer
Purposes, purposes
Make a connection so telepathic
Psychopathic, I'm a fuckin' savage
Now it's time to get hyperactive
Federation, I'm black flagging
Preparation from the black ass [?]
You guys been actin' Asthmatic
Niggas hundred yard dashin'
I'm not a comic, stop laughin'
If it's comic discretion
No more than a Comet, I'm blastin' off
What the fuck goin' thru my head
My mind just be driftin' off
That's my thoughts
Thinkin' bout' a thot
Trust my only thought
Countin' knots
Time for me to plot at rappers throwin' shots
Lyrical show that can mentally murder
And Denzel the Ultimate off to the 305
Flying Nimbus freestyle bitch, I'm on Cloud 9

[Hook: Denzel Curry]
Flyin' way over seas
I'm chillin' with the homies
Askin' me where I be
I'm somewhere the hoes be
This is where I'm supposed to be
It's just bad bitches only
You look like a puppy dog
You looking all so lonely
Flyin' way over seas
I'm chillin' with the homies
Askin' me where I be
I'm somewhere the hoes be
This is where I'm supposed to be
It's just bad bitches only
You look like a puppy dog
You looking all so lonely

[Verse 2: Lofty305]
Hoe bossin' ain't easy
I'm ballin' on a beatzy
Pussy bald like Jeezy
Gotta all white beezy
Leave her all white and jizzy
Its a Posh Gang nigga
Last Fall I was out in New York doing narc and fucking bitches
Don't give a fuck who you are, it's all about the Benji's
At the Aventura Mall in Miami bitches got the new Huaraches
Pocket book on Illuminati
Wrist a bitch like a moist towelette
That jizz walk is the whole body
That pussy profit I know bout it!

(ULTIMATE)

[Verse 3: Denzel Curry]
Pussy profit, get the pussy's poppin'
Fuck them sugar daddy's that will put through college
(ULTIMATE)
I get it in any means, regardless
Cause i'm hella heartless, looking down to god-like
(ULTIMATE)
You betta feel me, get crackin' on Benjamins
If it's no dividends
Then i'm sorry there's no house that you living in
Throw ink in remembrance
You will be livin' inside of my thoughts
Cause you just a Thot, trust my only thought
Countin' knots
Time for me to plot at rappers throwin' shots
Lyrical show that can mentally murder
And Denzel the Ultimate off to the 305
Flying Nimbus freestyle bitch, I'm on Cloud 9

[Hook: Denzel Curry]
Flyin' way over seas
I'm chillin' with the homies

I'm somewhere the hoes be
This is where I'm supposed to be

You looking all so lonely
Flyin' way over seas
I'm chillin' with the homies
Askin' me where I be
I'm somewhere the hoes be
This is where I'm supposed to be
It's just bad bitches only
You look like a puppy dog
You looking all so lonely
