[Intro: Denzel Curry]
MVP, Terrordome
Oh my God, Ronny

[Chorus: Denzel Curry]
I'm dope roller, can't control her, boy, I'm hotter than a solar
Dress code bipolar, never been a level lower
That's why I gotta take over, why is it time if it slow up
I gotta show off, tickin' time bomb, who 'bout to blow up?
Sick money, make my pockets throw up
Stay down, let the rockets go up like Houston (what?)
Y'all niggas not important (huh?) nigga try me, rigormortis (what?)
Leave a nigga read like fortunes (okay) rockets go up like Houston (what?)
Y'all niggas not important (huh?) nigga try me, rigormortis (what?)
Leave a nigga read no fortune (okay) rockets go up like Houston

[Verse: Denzel Curry]
I mix the Pac with the Slayer, I get my weed from Darth Vader
Speak with a mindless behavior, still getting high as Invader
On a space ship, elevator, thankin' two boys from Decatur
Ultimate is a trailblazer, I put the heat on a hater
Alligator, bitch I'm greater, scrapin' money, cheese grater
Ain't no debate that I go Norman Bates
Nigga swinging that hammer just like Kathy Bates
I'm from a place where they movin' that weight
You could call it that white, I call it Ricki Lake
Back in the thirty-six chambers I witnessed the danger
'Cause there is a yard full of snakes
Shame on a nigga, run game on a nigga
Put flame on a nigga 'cause I got souffl√©, ho

[Chorus: Denzel Curry]
I'm dope roller, can't control her, boy, I'm hotter than a solar
Dress code bipolar, never been a level lower
That's why I gotta take over, why is it time if it slow up
I gotta show off, tickin' time bomb, who 'bout to blow up?
Sick money, make my pockets throw up
Stay down, let the rockets go up like Houston (ayy)
Y'all niggas not important (what?) nigga try me, rigormortis (okay)
Leave a nigga read like fortunes (okay), rockets go up like Houston (what?)
Y'all niggas not important (huh?) nigga try me, rigormortis (okay)
Leave a nigga read no fortune (what), rockets go up like Houston
