[Verse 1]
Moshin' to nostalgic rock shit, I'm Brock bitch
Semi-automatic might blast like Team Rocket
Wait, and tell 'em I'm mixing that Slayer with that 2Pac shit
One golden bullet to kill all that faggot pop shit
Delivery, I'm the bullet that killed Kennedy
Enemy, D.I.T.C., darkest symphony
Necro, fuck around and let the TEC blow
Red beam to his noggin make it look like techno
I told you, I don't even wanna be the best, ho
I'm the threat with Tourette's making motherfuckers John Doe
Ricky Rozay, Aquarius Killa The Keyser Soze
Making a family cry together like the O'Jays
Back in the old days, I'm the one that's chosen
Thug from the 90's, I'm cryogenically frozen
Avenger, but yet I be the Joker and the Riddler
With a mindset that's switched like Harvey Denture's dent
The Dark Knight, fuck a Clark Kent
Martin Lawrence when he traveled back in time with suspense
Suspended, animation when my brain reacts
Don't belong in this world like I'm Samurai Jack
Click Clack on the Glock, seventeen get me
Then put the Ghostface so we can empty the cream
Cash rules everything around me surrounding
The ditch where they dug the darkness that's shrouding
Found me, Nemo, ego Kanyeezy
Bruh I'm from a city where niggas they con easy
Where they quick to pull that trigger, never a squeegee
Then make it on the late night news, nigga good evening

[News Cut]
Ya Mike, things are quite here now at Miami, Carol City High School, but earlier today was quite the scene when nearly the entire student body walked out of the school to protest Trayvon Martin's murder. Signs in hand, chanting justice for Trayvon. Now Trayvon actually went to school here at Carol City last year so some of these kids actually knew him personally, and they say his murderer should be behind bars

Moshin' to nostalgic rock shit, I'm Brock bitch

Wait, and tell 'em I'm mixing that Slayer with that 2Pac shit
One golden bullet to kill all that faggot pop shit
Moshin' to nostalgic rock shit, I'm Brock bitch
Semi-automatic might blast like Team Rocket
Wait, and tell 'em I'm mixing that Slayer with that 2Pac shit
One golden bullet to kill all that faggot pop shit

[Verse 2]
I'm Acid, fornicating with crack shit
Cheated with the virus that took over the life of Magic
Sharing a needle, with the common / hobo
Sterilize with the spit that shoots from a Komodo
Dragon, gun chuck, fire, I'm blasting
Dope and sick , that shit is just a classic
Huh, that's a hit for you bastards
That's the shit for you bastards
I'm lugubrious because I'm from a place where niggas
Shoot at shit and never on no Buddha shit, that knock-knock
And who is it? Am I really losing it? Maybe
Trapped in a white room with a dead baby
Am I going crazy? Is my name Casey?
Anthony, then the baby turns into an amputee
God damn I'm really losing my mind
Or should I end it all just by grabbing a nine?
But, it's too easy, Demonz of my mind leave me leave me
Put me into isolation so you wouldn't see me
Free me from misery and un-easy
Pain, emotions from the crypt I gain
Yet another young brain slain, mane...Dang!
He just lost consciousness
That's life when you live without consequence
Death over sixteen shots, his head is split
Dead
