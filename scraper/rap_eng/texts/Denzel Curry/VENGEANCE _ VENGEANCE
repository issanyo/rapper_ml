[Intro]
Ultimate, Ultimate

[Chorus: Denzel Curry]
I feel the pain, feel the rain
'Cause bitch, I want revenge
I feel the pain, feel the rain
'Cause bitch, I want revenge
I feel the pain, feel the rain
'Cause bitch, I want revenge
I feel the pain, feel the rain
'Cause bitch, I want revenge

[Verse 1: Denzel Curry]
Who the fuck you think you tryna creep on? (creep on)
Put a nigga in the black Nissan (Nissan)
I'm that nigga Freddy wouldn't sleep on
Catch a nigga in the bushes doing recon (yeah!)
Cops found a body in the alley (woo!)
Gotta rock the club like a caddie (woo!)
I'ma push your button like an innie (yeah!)
Switch it up and then I head to Cali (aw damn!)
Chop another bitch nigga up (up!)
Put them body parts in the bag (in the bag!)
Put them body parts in the concrete (concrete)
Spread the concrete across the whole city (whole city)
Plug a nigga up like a damn MIDI (uh!)
Voice in my head, got too many (too many)
Hit you with the metal like I'm Yung Simmie (brah!)
I'mma kill everybody how they do Kenny (brah!)
'Cause I go hard like Timmy! (Timmy!)
Nigga wanna talk about a nigga like Jimmy, Neutron
Told you don't mess with the Z-Eltron
Banish my demon, using a seance
Goddamn nigga, wanna talk about you
Put your ass in the ICU
Intensive, Care, Unit
If a nigga keep shootin', bitch! (woo!)

[Chorus: Denzel Curry]
I feel the pain, feel the rain
'Cause bitch, I want revenge
I feel the pain, feel the rain
'Cause bitch, I want revenge
I feel the pain, feel the rain
'Cause bitch, I want revenge
I feel the pain, feel the rain
'Cause bitch, I want revenge

[Verse 2: JPEGMAFIA]
Uh, made it past twenty-five, I'm set, bitch, let me die (five, die)
Bet you respect me when I check in with that .45 (five)
Slide, ride, this a homicide, pull up to the side, let that man retire
I ain't Drake, this ain't 6ix, issa 9ine, sticky, blicky, iron (sticky)
Heard you fuck with swine? (Uh-huh) that ain't my kind
Fuck who you run to, keep it tucked, you know my chopper shy
When it cries, it cries, if you die, you die, pussy, meet the sky
Rappers telling lies (uh-huh) ACOG, too hard, write a hit like Akon
Heard you talking shit on Twitter, 40 make 'em log off
Know my presence makes you bitter, bitch, you better be cautious
It's nasty

[Chorus: Denzel Curry & ZillaKami]
I feel the pain, feel the rain
'Cause, bitch, I want revenge
I feel the pain, feel the rain
'Cause, bitch, I want revenge
I feel the pain, feel the rain
'Cause, bitch, I want revenge
I feel the pain, feel the rain (ayy, hold on!)
'Cause, bitch, I want revenge (hold on!)

[Verse 3: ZillaKami]
Holy War! Put your black ass in a duffle bag
And slide off in the hopes, it's a closed casket
My presence alone can exterminate masses
The tongue speak spells, cause blazing rashes
Like who gonna go and betray the beast?
Like who gonna go and start war with me?
Nigga, who gonna go and betray the Zii?
Godzilla (wardogs!), go start a feast
It's the wardog, sup (wassup)
Five-star general, ten-hut (wassup)
In the bottom of hell I, clutch (wassup)
Hands covered in blood and, rust (wassup)
No nigga can take my, soul (wassup)
Drop dead, them heads will, roll (wassup)
We'll drop the corpse in the cold (wassup)
War dog, I'll stick to the code (wassup)
Ayy, now I'm muddy booted, redrumin'
Body baggin', head huntin', police siren, fence jumping
Black metal, gun bustin'
Wardog bitch, we gon' tape up our fists
We the wardogs bitch, wear our rank on our wrist (woo!)

[Chorus: Denzel Curry]
I feel the pain, feel the rain
'Cause, bitch, I want revenge
I feel the pain, feel the rain
'Cause, bitch, I want revenge
I feel the pain, feel the rain
'Cause, bitch, I want revenge
I feel the pain, feel the rain
'Cause, bitch, I want revenge
I feel the pain, feel the rain
'Cause, bitch, I want revenge
I feel the pain, feel the rain
'Cause, bitch, I want revenge
I feel the pain, feel the rain
'Cause, bitch, I want revenge
I feel the pain, feel the rain
'Cause, bitch, I want revenge

[Outro: Mickey de Grand IV]
Looking in the mirror, the night has come
I've been waiting such a long, long time, to see you on
I can't help but smile as I load the bullet right
So excited, can't sit still gonna catch you (In the moonlight)
Catch you (In the moonlight)
