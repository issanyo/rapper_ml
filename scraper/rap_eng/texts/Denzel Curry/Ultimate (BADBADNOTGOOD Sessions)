[Chorus]
I am the one, don't weigh a ton
Don't need a gun to get respect up on the street
Under the sun, the bastard son
Will pop the Glock to feed himself and family
By any means, your enemies, my enemies
We wet them up like a canteen
The yellow tape surrounds the fate
Don't have a face, so now you late, open the gates

[Verse 1]
Great, eliminate like ElimiDate
Hey, young boy had to penetrate
Face, young boy done caught a case
Bang, now his mama livin' with the pain
Wait, doctor says he's gonna stay
Let him get the Senzu Bean so he regenerate
Now a nigga harder than the head of the state
Denzel Curry is the new candidate
Ultimate, alternate, you are the opposite
Stop this shit, chop your esophagus
Bitches be boppin' it, bow down and pop it in
Droppin' it in her esophagus
She get so nasty, in public she classy
Perhaps she is able to swallow it
Girl, I can make you a star
Then I put her ass on Apollo, bitch
Bitch, I am ultimate, behold my awesomeness
Narcissist, part time an arsonist
Rippin' through cartilage, I am the hardest, bitch
Wrap it up, put in sarcophagus
Dearly departed, it's done when it started
So now that I'm livin' so harmonious
Feelin' like Spartacus, Curry the ultimate
I am the best, there's no politics
I'm ultimate, ultimate
Bitch, I'm...

[Chorus]
I am the one, don't weigh a ton
Don't need a gun to get respect up on the street
Under the sun, the bastard son
Will pop the Glock to feed himself and family
By any means, your enemies, my enemies
We wet them up like a canteen
The yellow tape surrounds the fate
Don't have a face, so now you late, open the gates

[Verse 2]
Ultimate, infinite, flow is opium
Open the internet, photosynthesis
Put up parentheses, temporary
Very scary if I feel like Dirty Harry
Just might bust a bitch, never knew my life
But yet the question is, "Is he fake? Is he real?"
What the message is, chop a bitch nigga up
I'ma sever it when I sever shit
I kill 'em, no Kony, these niggas ain't homies
Claim you the homie, I turn into Broly
Droppin' melodic, enter the cosmic
Flow like a prophet, lyrical toxic
Flow like a foreigner, I'm the torturer
Out of South Florida, call the coroner
Killed in the corridor, I'm the overlord
Rhymes like a sorcerer, I'm an animorph
Bitch, I'm a beast
Nigga, you tell me who fuckin' with me
K to the I to the N to the G
Claim you the hottest, but I disagree
Better learn something and get a degree
This for Lord Infamous, so R.I.P
Arrivederci, bitches lookin' thirsty
Ridin' through the dirty, like it's mandatory
Ending of the story
I'm ultimate, ultimate
Bitch, I'm...

[Chorus]
I am the one, don't weigh a ton
Don't need a gun to get respect up on the street
Under the sun, the bastard son
Will pop the Glock to feed himself and family
By any means, your enemies, my enemies
We wet them up like a canteen
The yellow tape surrounds the fate
Don't have a face, so now you late, open the gates

[Outro]
Ultimate
BADBADNOTGOOD
Good, good, not bad
Oh, you mad? That's sad
Aye, aye, ULT
