[Verse 1: Gerard O'Connell & Katie Taylor]
I tried to keep these feelings in control
I've tried to find a reason not to show you
But every time I do, I give my all
Just can't let it go

[Pre Chorus: Gerard O'Connell & Katie Taylor]
And even if you say, even if you say no
I'm gonna fight babe
'Cause what I need has taken hold
And even if you play, even if you play dumb
It's not gonna change me (it's not gonna change me)

[Chorus: Gerard O'Connell & Katie Taylor]
If this is how real feels
Then I guess I want it
If this is how real feels
Then I guess I'm on it
If this is how real feels
Well it feels like falling
Yeah, I feel like falling
For you

[Verse 2: Gerard O'Connell & Katie Taylor]
I'm getting bored of artificial love
That one night feeling is never quite enough
There's evidence in each that we touch
That I'm not giving up

[Pre Chorus: Gerard O'Connell & Katie Taylor]
And even if you say, even if you say no
I'm gonna fight babe
'Cause what I need has taken hold
And even if you play, even if you play dumb
It's not gonna change me (it's not gonna change me)

[Chorus: Gerard O'Connell & Katie Taylor]
If this is how real feels
Then I guess I want it
If this is how real feels
Then I guess I'm on it
If this is how real feels
Well it feels like falling
Yeah, I feel like falling
For you, you

[Bridge: Katie Taylor, Gerard O'Connell & Katie Taylor]
Yeah, I feel like fallin'
For you, you
Yeah, I feel like fallin'

[Verse 3: Denzel Curry]
I won't forget about the falls and slips
The flaws are seeping through your flawless lips
If I'm the sun, then you are my eclipse
It will never be there forever so to get a glimpse
I feel though you
I, can't even deny
Girl you blew my mind
Can't forget you if I tried
In a moment, at my lowest, you get me back on my feet
My heart is cold and yet it been stolen
She won't give it back to me
I fell hard, I don't want to fall anymore
Fell hard, she don't want it all anymore
Rewind, it's like we been here before
Love lost, there's not a 'we' anymore, hey, hey

[Chorus: Gerard O'Connell & Katie Taylor]
If this is how real feels
Then I guess I want it
If this is how real feels
Then I guess I'm on it
If this is how real feels
Well it feels like falling
Yeah, I feel like falling
For you, you

[Outro: Katie Taylor, Gerard O'Connell & Katie Taylor]
Yeah, I feel like fallin'
For you, you
Yeah, I feel like fallin'
For you, you
Yeah, I feel like fallin'
For you, you
Yeah, I feel like fallin'
