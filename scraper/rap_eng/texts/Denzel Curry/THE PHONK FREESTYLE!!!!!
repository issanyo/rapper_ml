[Verse]
I am that nigga with the phonk
Niggas talkin' shit, I'mma slide with that pump
Yeah nigga it is me, D-E-N-Z-E-L
From that Raider Klan and you know I ain't gon' fail
I don't really know how these niggas come in the game and they say that they 'bout shit
Get deep in the pussy, it's wet and cushy
I'm gettin' hoes wet like a fountain
Mountain, get on the top of the Everest coolin' with penguin
Curry the killa, was born to be trilla than niggas they say I'm a genius
Einstein Aquarius'Killa, the niggas I'm not in the right mind
Give me a watch and a clock and a Glock and I'm tellin' you that it's the right time
Tech 9, Mac10, them niggas they come and they bust 8
16 bustin 16, niggas is dead weight
Hey, just like the Titanic you know that it's goin' down
Mixtape rappers won't survive in the underground
You runnin' with [?], I'm runnin' with God
[?], you know mines a job
My nigga done trippin', on fours I be tippin'
I keepin' the whippin' like sonic boom
So when I strike back that [?] shit is 'bout to blow
Nah this ain't no Scarecrow, like Pillsbury I wants dough
I wants more, yes nigga I wants more
Denzel Curry, Raider Klan y'all niggas should know
I am that nigga with the phonk
Niggas talkin' shit, I'mma slide with that pump nigga
I am that nigga with the phonk nigga
I am that nigga, I am that nigga
I am that
