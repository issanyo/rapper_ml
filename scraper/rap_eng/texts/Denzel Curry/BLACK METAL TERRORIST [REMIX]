[Intro: Denzel Curry}
Finish 'em Zel, finish 'em Zel
I give 'em hell, don't wish 'em well
Finish 'em Zel, finish 'em Zel
I'm raising hell, send 'em to hell

[Verse 1: Wacko Knight]
Black metal terrorist, acting so serious
Question me like I'm mysterious
You all are idiots, and your affiliates
I am a ghost like Insidious
You're so oblivious, show no resilience
Suffer from your inexperience
Why you so hideous? Feeling so piteous
Beating, you are the recipient
Bitches I feast
All of you fuckers are messing with me
Do not fuck with me, you know I'm a beast
Kill all you fuckers, your bitch is deceased (bitch is deceased)
Your brother is dead
Don't want the pussy, I only want head
Inside the needle, I fit like a thread
Tear through you fuckers, bitch I fucking shred (I fucking shred)

[Bridge: Wacko Knight]
Jackal in a jack mood
Everything that I say will be taboo
In a bad mood, but I'm back too
Everything that I say will be taboo

[Verse 2: Wacko Knight]
I am the one, don't weigh a ton
Don't need a gun to get respect up on the street
ULT
Don't fuck with me
On the south side and you know how we be
Please get the fuck, get the fuck off my dick
Pull up with .40, I let that shit hit
Don't get accused but these crimes I commit
Think that I did it, I never admit
You know that I am the one
All of you bitches are done
I do this shit just for fun
You either come stay or you run
Torturing, killing my infidels easily
This ain't a challenge, this only the half of me
Kill you, Bohemian Rhapsody
All of your life has just been a tragedy

[Verse 3: Wacko Knight]
Live by my confidence, die by my arrogance
Heaven and hell is irrelevant
Know our requisite
Say it so eloquent
All of this proof is so evident
King of the streets
I do not think you are fucking with me
I'll let you in, yeah I'll give you the key
Give you your freedom, yeah you're fucking free, you're fucking free
