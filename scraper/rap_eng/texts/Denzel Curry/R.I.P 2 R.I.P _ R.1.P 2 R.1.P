[Verse]
Came back hard cause you think it's a joke
Thought I fell off but I came back for more
Young Zeltron go zero below
I stay cold, that's from head to toe
You on the pole, you on a bean
I can make a bitch seem like I'm the dream
No fourteen, nigga this thirteen
Got hella hoes like the state of Beijing
Bitch I'm sick like the measles
Bitch I ball like the Eagles
Y'all niggas looking like Sm√©agol
Got a lawyer and a paralegal
Free Lil Pump
Too cliche if I said "fuck Trump"
Try one of mine, bet a nigga get jumped
Came from the bottom I came from a swamp (with)
Alligator shoes, off the avenue
Making money day, and night, and afternoon
Went from making music tryna balance school
People called me gook and yet I made it cool
What the fuck can you say about the nigga Denzel Curry mane
Bitch I got it from the dirty mane
And I did it under thirty mane
Got a whole pocket full of sherbert
First, second, third verse, heard your mixtape never heard worse
Niggas wanna con never converse
They just wanna ride a nigga wave 'cause a nigga making commerce
"Denzel use too many big words"
Sounds like y'all niggas watch big bird
Girls wanna talk but way back then like a fine fat bitch I got big curves
You'll concur if you've been there, nigga
This ain't style, this swimwear, nigga
Everybody know that a nigga drip hard
Got hoes begging for the skin care, nigga
Young'uns wanna hate but I don't care, nigga
Old heads hate when they lose hair, nigga
Sorry but I don't compare, nigga
I can do it all and it's not fair, nigga

[Chorus]
Y'all wack as fuck, bitch I'm black as fuck (Fuck)
They be asking why I'm acting up (Up)
'Cause you ain't down with us (Us)
On the bus, fuck a bust down I'd rather bust a nut (Bust a nut)
I don't trust niggas talking down but wanna keep in touch (Fuck nigga)
Y'all wack as fuck, bitch I'm black as fuck (Fuck)
They be asking why I'm acting up (Up)
Cause you ain't down with 'us (Us)
On the bus, fuck a bust down I'd rather bust a nut (Bust a nut)
I don't trust niggas talking down but wanna keep in touch (Ugh)
