[Intro]
LAPD Police Station
Yes, I'd like to report a murder, a dead body or something
Where at?
In the alley

[Hook: B.G. Knocc Out]
Rollin' in my hood, twistin' on them Ds
Hangin' with my partners, tossin' forties on the corner
Rollin' in my hood, twistin' on them Ds
Hangin' with my partners, tossin' forties on the corner
Rollin' in my hood, twistin' on them Ds
Hangin' with my partners, tossin' forties on the corner
Rollin' in my hood, twistin' on them Ds
Hangin' with my partners, tossin' forties on the corner

[Verse 1: Denzel Curry]
Playa in 1999, Raven Myagi
I stay on my grind, and proceed to the shine
I break out that Nine, aim it and cock it
Don't fuck nigga drop it, I shoot it, they pop it
I lay down the line, just like a pipe
Like a blunt gettin sliced at the end of a scythe
Grim to the reaper, I'm 'bout to get deeper
Blackland, Carol City my shit, day and night
Bitch, fuck a man on the moon, I'm Captain Planet
I'm plantin' the shrooms
Evacuate the fuckin' premises lyricists
Evidence running with Raider Klan room, all black Ugly Mane
Just like pro meth-heads, I'm makin' a stain
Hoes talk that shit, and they always run game
But when niggas beckon, they screaming yo name
Fuck them stupid hoes, really that's the way it goes
I bought Triple Six and Outkast Greatest Hits
So niggas can't touch me, a friend or a foe
And Slikk, I fucked up yo shit, young nigga, yo ass gone lame
I'm the best outta Carol City, ever since Gunplay

[Hook: B.G. Knocc Out]
Rollin' in my hood, twistin' on them Ds
Hangin' with my partners, tossin' forties on the corner
Rollin' in my hood, twistin' on them Ds
Hangin' with my partners, tossin' forties on the corner
Rollin' in my hood, twistin' on them Ds
Hangin' with my partners, tossin' forties on the corner
Rollin' in my hood, twistin' on them Ds
Hangin' with my partners, tossin' forties on the corner

[Verse 2: Lil Ugly Mane]
Listen young man, I can pop you with one hand, rob you with the other
Ugly Mane, I go dumb-head
I'm a one man unaffiliated private institution, don't confuse it
Me and Raider Klan is tight as nooses
All black Zeus-in', it gets gruseome if you slip it
Leave you imprisoned inside a chalk line around your final position
Got this forty that I'm sippin', 'cause it's boring with no competition
I'm slidin' through the hood on these Ds that I'm twistin'
This is for the playas, this is for the runners
This is for them hustlers smokin' herbs in abundance
Flippin' nothin less than onions, pullin' guns as big as Paul Bunyon
We keep it more than underground, we in a dungeon

[Hook: B.G. Knocc Out]
Rollin' in my hood, twistin' on them Ds
Hangin' with my partners, tossin' forties on the corner
Rollin' in my hood, twistin' on them Ds
Hangin' with my partners, tossin' forties on the corner
Rollin' in my hood, twistin' on them Ds
Hangin' with my partners, tossin' forties on the corner
Rollin' in my hood, twistin' on them Ds
Hangin' with my partners, tossin' forties on the corner
