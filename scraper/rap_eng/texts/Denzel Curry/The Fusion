[Chorus: Allan Kingdom]
You say that you 'bout that
But I highly doubt that
You say I been down bad
I just had to bounce back
You say that you 'bout that
But I highly doubt that
I be off the loud pack
I be off the bounce back

You say that you 'bout that
But I highly doubt that
You say I been down bad
I just had to bounce back
You say that you 'bout that
But I highly doubt that
I be off the loud pack
I be off the bounce back

[Verse 1: Allan Kingdom]
It's a little confused, huh
When a nigga lose her and get a new one
I'm winning, I was feeling like a loser
Like Jimmy, Macintosh is a computer
I hope I'm just a regular dude
Martin Lawrence with a little Martin Luther
Fresh prince with a little more Kunta
Get bent with a nigga with a future
I try-y-y
To hi-i-ide
The ti-i-imes
I've cri-i-ied
I survi-i-ived
All the hype and all the rumors
I'm David, you Goliath with a few guns
If you thinking you a giant nigga prove some', nah

[Hook: Allan Kingdom]
Hit 'em with the fusion, nah
Hit 'em with the fusion, nah, damn
Hit 'em with the fusion, nah
Hit 'em with the fusion, nah, damn
Hit 'em with the fusion, nah
Hit 'em with the fusion, nah, damn
Hit 'em with the fusion, nah
Hit 'em with the fusion, nah, damn

[Chorus: Allan Kingdom]
You say that you 'bout that
But I highly doubt that
You say I been down bad
I just had to bounce back
You say that you 'bout that
But I highly doubt that
I be off the loud pack
I be off the bounce back



[Post-Chorus: Allan Kingdom]
Hit 'em with the fusion, nah (bounce back)
Hit 'em with the fusion, nah (bounce back)

[Verse 2: Denzel Curry]
Hit with the fusions, I'm rolling up mixed
You could say that we blending
You Derek Jeter but I'm Sammy Sosa
We mix 'em together, we sending
Hits out on the regular, crashing the nebula
If it returns it's a comet
It's catostrophic
Put it together, now we atomic
Spread through the air like bubonic
Juicin', abusin', the greatest influence
The only ruin that was made by the fusion
Initially it is an illest illusion
Conclusion that you will die in the confusion
Anonymous and unknown, grinding 'til the sun gone
Mama gettin' worried, shit she telling me to come home
I'm a road runner but I can't afford to run home
Whip like coyotes, we turn into John Doe

[Chorus: Allan Kingdom]
You say that you 'bout that
But I highly doubt that
You say I been down bad
I just had to bounce back
You say that you 'bout that
But I highly doubt that
I be off the loud pack
I be off the bounce back

You say that you 'bout that
But I highly doubt that
You say I been down bad
I just had to bounce back
You say that you 'bout that
But I highly doubt that
I be off the loud pack
I be off the bounce back
