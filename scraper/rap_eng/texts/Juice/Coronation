[Verse One]
Big Juice I bring pain on any track that I'm spitting on
Your record deal ain't even worth the paper that it's written on
'gac I'm still sipping it, script I'm ill flipping
Chicks, we ill dicking 'em quick, I spill rhythm with
F5 and Dave from the naughty northwest side
They tell me I'm to Illinois what Biggie was to Bedstuy
Or TLC to Left Eye, my penmanship
Is similar to the balance beam I tend to trip
First I ask the Lord forgive me my sins and shit
Then contenders get stomped up and injured quick
Then I begin to rip, the crowd's making me snap
If it ain't Juice, the producers are wasting a track
Taking it back to when an MC was able to rap
These niggas fell the fuck off with no cable's attached
Beat Juice? What kind of fucking fable is that?
From my gat spark, the black Clark Gable is back
None have ever been better since, with drums I'm unhesitant
Plus I got my stripes like 101 peppermints
It's become evident, the web I've spun is excellence
I've come to sun residents and that's to son's detriment
Alphabetically, we like P and Q
I'm one step ahead, when comparing me to you
And this is just a piece of
A fraction of verse of
A nigga that'll rip all cats braille or cursive

[Verse Two]
Juice
I'm back I don't know if niggas heard or not
But I'm tight like virgin twat and my words are hot
Plus I got more tools than brain surgeon's got
Splurge a lot but I never got the urge to stop
I'm real, like the moment it occurred to 'Pac
It was on when homie pulled up to the curb and shot
I'll serve the whole block, don't disturb my spot
The southside, the westside, the 'burbs is locked
Y'all saw envelops of the rhymes I wrote
They holy like Jesus Christ designed my quotes
I stays in your blood stream, my lines are dope
So dope I could prolly sell my lines for coke
Hey, in battles I ain't never been the kind to choke
I make your bitch give me brains until her spine is broke
I'm a menace like Dennis is, vivid mic images
Rappers metaphors be as slow as watching tennis is
Shells spitting, I exhale in Hell's kitchen
Plus I ride the track like the third rail's missing
Mr. Brown Deniro, the local town hero
Your bitch is getting dug the fuck out like Ground Zero
Every chance I write, I trample the mic
Somebody call United, have 'em cancel the flight
Beef you can't afford this
The whole crowd applaud this
I separate your head from your body like a cordless
