[Verse One: All Natural]
Hip hop started out in the park
But now we do it on Diversey and Clark
Stony Island to the Dan Ryan
Other cities be lyin'
Claiming that they're flyin'
And when they fly in
We be waitin' at O'Hare-a
Smudge their mascara like Scarlett O'Hara
We gone with the wind in the Windy City
Where brothers ain't pleasant and people ain't friendly
To any body flippin' fanciful follies
Knuckles make a nigga knees buckle like Ollie [??]
Whether Wally or Molly
Back in the Chi, we make moves like a dolly
Or blacken the eye
But Marty [??] ain't discover me
I play the undercover
But on the other brother I smash and then smother
Crash and in a flash we dash and all the others
That be cash, mackin' ass to task
I ain't stutter
We been butter
Won our battles and ten brothers
And if you don't know us by now, then fuck ya
You just a duck, that's why we won't duck
I just battle but the others might buckle
You come with respect, you get respect right back
But come with the tec, you get the tec right back
Slacker mirror image so if you wanna scrimmage
Skirmish will do deadly damage to your upper epidermis
Burners ain't new in this land of money-earners
We, my man and his crew, is a band of honey-learners
You know the time, like the one S.S
Brothers talk a lot of mess but I ain't impressed
You get bench-pressed
In my spare time
When I bring stress
With this spare rhyme
You see, All Natural and the Capital D
Knowing the real capital ain't nowhere near D.C

[Hook x2]
Cause it's
Ill advised, and highly illogical
To try to get Ill in Chicago, Illinois
So chill and be still before it gets volatile
Because you can't deal with the Go Ill

[Verse Two: Juice]
Chicago, Ill, I'm for real
I'm one of the real
My flow kill, annihilate the run-of-the-mill
I be violatin' rappers who be gummin' their grill
And I try to wait until they spit something I feel
But you can't get your whole damn entire arm firebombed
Me and Cap start more beef that Hillshire Farm
I rock spots
One of the undisputed top notch
I was there when Liquid Kitty used to be the Bop Shop
I was rippin' niggas when the Elbow was the hot spot
I was at Elixir when a couple niggas got shot
In my town the white boys get drunk off one beer
You run near the wrong cats, your vision will be unclear
I'm def like a nigga who can only use one ear
So point blank: don't come here and be actin' like you're from here
I rep where I come from, in case that shit is unclear
You can have fun here, or you can get done here
Your crew: you can kick it in my town and stay comfortable
If not, I got some cats that can definitely fuck with you
It's up to you
Like Black Sheep, the choice is yours
You get smacked in your face tryin' to act hardcore
Two of the sickest: J-U and Capital D
Who love to kick this
And dope is what we happen to be
So let's get it real straight
And feel real straight
To lay my shine down for the fuckin' Ill state

[Hook x2]
Cause it's
Ill advised, and highly illogical
To try to get Ill in Chicago, Illinois
So chill and be still before it gets volatile
Because you can't deal with the Go Ill
