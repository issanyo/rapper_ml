[Verse 1]
It's big juice coming for finger plate of hot potato
Just another ball headed nigga like Sinead O
Connor but my raps will cover any genre
I'ma kick the type of shit that girl Jane is Rhonda
Urban Entertainment on seed you simply
Drives me 8D everything wanna be orgy
It's very rare shocking niggas, that's what I'm used to
Drugs from my clocking niggas, the brother used to
[?] you, Chicago I am straight out
Take you out your crew out your whole fucking stayed out
So black no matter where you from you better go back
Before you be a rapper walking around without a Bozak
Kidnap your DJ have your rapping over no tracks
Run to your trade you ain't your mic off the go blackjack
21 anyone we drop off the funk hard
I'm drunk are straight out the motherfucking junkyard
Row near a pitch angle from the shit that were you simply
Press the yellow tape and body bags just simple
Smoke from his nap love to choke your whole flat hand
Just pulling wrappers off the stage like the Sandman
To understand man I hid it in the crash
And it's a grand slam hot damn [?]
