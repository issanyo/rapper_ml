[Verse 1]
I should be ashamed how I break for it
When you're not around, I just ache for it
Sit around and wait for it
Oh God, give me peace
It should never feel this good
Being weak on my knees, praying for you
Thinking I need more you
Sinkin' at my core for you
But this ain't news
You got me lusting, lying on the floor
I got a thing, got a thing for

[Chorus]
Boys like you
Boys like you
Boys like you
Come on pretty baby
Don't you leave me with goodbye (boy)
Tell me that you love me, even if it's for one night

[Verse 2]
Even from a distance
You find a way to be the bane of my existence
I hear 'em whisper I should leave but I don't listen
They don't know this
They ain't been in my position
This shit is twisted, this shit is twisted
I'm standing right in front of you and yet you're missing

Come for me, comfort me
My misery could use a little company
I think I'm losing it cause you're the only one for me
I been needing you to spell it whicha tongue for me
I been needing you to spell it whicha tongue for me
Keep you sprung on me, get you strung on me
Give your lungs to me, don't you run from me, don't you run from me

[Chorus]
Boys like you
Boys like you
Boys like you
Come on pretty baby
Don't you leave me with goodbye (boy)
Tell me that you love me, even if it's for one night
