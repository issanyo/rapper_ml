(Hook: Mediumjay)
Back 2 Basics, Egg white laces
Wish you would nigga cause your addicted to fake shit
(2x)

(Verse 1: Mediumjay)
If this was the matrix, you would take the blue pill
I'm too real, 20 minutes I would've left the movie theatre
Mr. Cage gone in 20 seconds are we clear
You better pull a Ryan Gosling and drive up outta here
Steer clear of the asshole with no goals
Only purpose is to fuck you up and drink when I'm alone
Pop culture, picking at it like a vulture
I don't blame ya it's just in ya nature
Back 2 Basics, My soul will strengthen
Listen to all ya gossiping up outta ya trachea
Up outta the trachea wtf you saying bruh?
I have blood bath with your internal organs and laugh
You work at dominoes, I'll do oragami
The origins of the vocal cord stems from the black man who received the short end
This verse is metamorphine, anni-morphius
They call me Morphius cause I was the pre-planned abortion kid

(Hook)

(Verse 2: Juice)
This is me now, Trini mothafucka so I will come and bow
After my performance why? Cause I love to dance
I'm a good dancer that's what I do I prance
Around you, if we in the ring
I'm not a boxer but we can go ding ding ding
How many rounds maybe even 3
Maybe even 5, GSP
Will get fucked up by Mr. Bones Jones
But Bones Jones would lose Mr. Silva
But they would all get fucked up by Bruce Lee
But all them would get fucked up by Me! Woo
They call me Julius Earlington Stewart
... (Yeah, Yeah, check it)
Just keeping my precautions myself steady
That's what I do so my bitches they are ready
Ready and Steady, that just rhymes
But my vocabulary is not as big as it should be
So I better sound better when I'm not good
Because it's like playing ball with no hops
It's like you know what, Yeaah fuck it

(Hook)

(Verse 3: Stewie)
Know you bout that false why you rocking wit the trues
You a square ass nigga you ain't fuckin with my loop
I'm a spartan riding the 300
The weed that we box have you feeling at yo summit
The drippy drinking is hella potent
Shawty take a shot feelin open
Now ya coasting like the ocean
Got a birds eye view with the herbs I blew
And the words I spew got the girls hype too
Damn, Stewie you really did it
Nigga I been spittin since a nigga rock the fitted
First I learn to ball then I learned around my syllable
Doing it for fun but people taking it literal
