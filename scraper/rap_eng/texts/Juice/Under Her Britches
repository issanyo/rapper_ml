[Verse 1: OnCue]
Hey baby what’s your name?
I really want to know your name
I mean really you kidding I know yall feel me
So let’s get this money and split it like a filly
But they sleeping on me all just like a silly, mattress
Trying to stick my dick in an actress
Vanessa Hudgens your my baby I like it
I would say Lohan but man she don’t like this
I got a plan I’mma pull down my pants and scream Lindsey come ride this!
How she gonna fight this?
I’m just tryna fuck it, I ain’t tryna caught it
But if I give her my dick she probably wanna snort it
Nowadays man I’m so damn important
Parents gave me a trust fund for my recording
Now I’m getting Taylor like my first name Lord and
If that’s your girl man please be cautious
Smash your wife shawty turn nauseous
I’m ‘bout my business and the bed be my office

[Hook: OnCue]

I can never be what you want me to be
So baby I’mma give you tell me what you need
Don’t you see I’m going to the top
And I’m never going to stop
Til I hear ya pussy poppin
And I won’t stop til ya climax (yeah)
I can’t stop til ya climax (no)
I won’t stop til ya climax
Take it out your pussy and stick it in your ass

[Verse 2: OnCue]
Oh my God, yes man
Think I got my swagger back
Look at my eyes man I think I’m getting cataracts
Took her virginity but baby she can have it back
Young and sexy I ain’t lookin for attach-a-ment
Oops I mean attachment
No, no, accent
Flow you can’t match this, Not even my ad libs
Homie you average
Me I am getting stickers like smileys and scratchy's
Holla at this
I know your girl want to pick up the telephone and dial
Come to the crib and chill for a while
Watch you sit on the couch
Word on everything man I’mma turn that bitch out
And that’s my word so please don’t test me
Have her good with my stick like Wayne Gretzky
Getting under my covers calling me sexy
Whatever name she ain’t calling you

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Juice]
I can never be, anything but nasty
One night will have your pussy splashing
I just might baby girl if you ask me, so just ask me
Take it out your pussy stick it in your asshole
But fast forward baby don’t try to kiss me
Said you like your back worked
So I’ll call action, now my harddrives filled with passion
Stuck it in sounded like your booty was laughing *fart noise*
Ain’t nothing funny when it’s going down
When she’s around and I’m aroused
She makes those sounds that make me proud
She screams my name even when I’m not around (Juicy!)
That’s why her man can’t stand me
Had to send her back to her family
She told me she got a sweet tooth my dick is like candy
