[Verse One: Juice]
Somebody, dim the lights, prepare the booth
Shit, get your bungie cord, prepare the chutes
Rappers can't really do shit but stare at Juice
I'm the opposite of a Chinese/American truce
I'm nuclear war, damaging your frame
Let's separate Juice from all the rappers in the game
Separate me from all your open mic's please
Cause them little guns ain't smoking like these
Plus I pull a gun off hand all full of Rum
Bullets will come flying with no bullets in son
But see I'm not the type to just pull it and run
I'll stay there gunning, why play fair?
Rule #3, stay out of J hair
Stay off of J block or catch a stray shot
It's death and dishonor, I keep sick drama
The mind of Fidel Castro, I'm just calmer
C.O.D.E. R.E.D
This is D.O.P.E. staring me
Code Red, you niggas hot that's why I'm ripping with y'all
But you other niggas, know that Juice is different than y'all
You need to face it, my doe, my flow is just best
And holler at me pimp I got 'dro in excess
And by the time niggas see J back in Louisville
I guarantee I'll have at least two/three mil'

[Verse Two: El]
Ayo who spits?
With attitude like rude bitch
If it ain't El, it don't blend like a Clue mix
Rappers front hard but got no balls like eunuchs
Before seeing me, you'd rather see your mom in a nude flick
I bust out the soul/sole even when my shoes fit
Acapella, acoustic or live band on some Roots shit
Element 1's roots is, more deeper than rap is
Deeper than, Jigga's drug money under that mattress
A whole lot of you cats is, one of the main factors
That Code Red run the streets while showing their asses
Cracker ass crackers
Even Japs and blacks is
Downloading my tracks as if I own half of Napster
You half a rapper, mixed with two quarters bitch
And your money don't stack just like two quarter's split
I'm like two corner's of Crips and two blocks of Bloods
Before you posture up, better do lots of drugs
Are y'all some 2Pac's or what?
Same thugs running around like you hot
When you 'bout to make a the Element hot you up
It's Code Red and Juice but you behind the 12's
Them majors ain't want it so we signed our self
