[Hook: Stewie]
Bad bitches on our dick (We got it)
Solid niggas in our clique (We got it)
Type of flow to make a nigga rich (We got it)
Pay attention to who you fuckin with (Cause we mobbin)
(2x)

(Verse 1: Stewie)
Pretty nigga in the face see I got it
Couple hundred dollas what you find is in my wallet
Double shots waitin for a nigga at the bar
I got some bubble butts waiting for a nigga in the car, arrghhh

(Verse 2: Mediumjay)
Hookers from Bombay, We got it
They're off cocaine, But I'm a pothead
Hotel on the coast of mississauga--
I pull out and nutted on her forehead

(Verse 3:Juice)
Yea, I'm feelin myself right now
Blazin this weed looking something like a Lou
You know I am, you know I am
Slowly passing out but it's all in the mind I say fuck it and cashout

[Hook]

(Verse 4: Stewie)
All about my fam but fucking with me second nature
If she feelin up the clique then I'll just have to replace her
Girls ain't getting off me, wearing women as cologne
If she ain't givin' the pussy, bitch you better give me dome

(Verse 5: Mediumjay)
See I met a big booty chick out in Puerto Rico
Ate that ass out with some paprika
Use my pinkie like I was holding a teacup
She running her hands through my waves and gets seasick

(Verse 6: Stewie)
I'm the crazy type these ladies like, these dudes are feelin envy
Bet these niggas betting cause these women wish they met me
What the hell tell me why you so conceded
Get in my bed you'll understand after I eat it, Ahh

[Hook]

(Verse 7: Mediumjay)
I put the tip in, And now she is smitten
I held this bitch down with no fuckin mittens
Ate her bare bone like them kids from world vision
And I hit the pussy out the park without fuckin missing

{Bridge: Mediumjay}
I don't mean to be a dick, But I got one
Seamen spraying like the shells of a shot gun
(2x)
