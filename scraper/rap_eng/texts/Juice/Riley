Is it good to you? (Oooh, yeah, yeah)
Is it good to you? (woo, woo, woo, yeah, yeah)
Is it good to you? (oh, oh)
Is it good to you?
When my love comes down, I don't have to run around...
I've got you and you know just what to do
To fulfill all my needs and satisfy me...
But I'd like to know if the sexual healing is mutual
Do you feel what I'm feeling?
Do I please you? Do I fill the need? I know I might sound bold
But I'd just like to know...
Is it good to you? I want to know...
Is it good to you? Oooh, I got to know, yeah...
Is it good to you? C'mon and tell me, boy, yeah...
Is it good to you?

(Yo T.L., kick the verse)
Ooh, don't be afraid, when we're makin' love, c'mon and say yeah
Tell me just how you like it, I'll talk dirty to you baby
While you drive me crazy...
And I'd like to know if that sexual healing is mutual
Do you feel what I'm feeling?
All my love's for you, all this love is true and I'll never let you go
But I just got to know...
Is it good to you? I want to know...
Is it good to you? Ooh, I got to know, yeah...
