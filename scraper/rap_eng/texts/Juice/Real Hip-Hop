[Juice]
Back when (back when)
Way back (way back)
I'mma take you way back (way back yo)
One nigga's life on 2 inch (my life)
Let's go back (way back)
Way back (Uh huh)
Follow me now...

I spend long days and long nights gettin' songs tight
But Mr. Battle Rap got seen in the wrong light
You know my resume, Skribble Jam, Rap Olympics
Rap sheet, from then on it's all academic
I taught the underground how to make a flow great
Juice and Eminem on The Wake Up Show tapes
For most fan, that's when Juice was first seen
I showed the world how to spit it off the head verse clean
Showed emcees what a real verse mean
Nasty off the head since the age of thirteen
I used to embarass other rappers back then
Before T-Boz started datin' Mack 10
Way back before I was a name in the game
No rap fame, no fat chain
Now they line up to see Juice when he tours
And for those that stuck with me, I'm exclusively yours

For real hip hop, real hip hop (Northpole)
I can't let 'em steal hip hop (Southside)
I'm here 'til this shit stop (Westside)
So get 'em up if you feel hip hop, hop (No doubt)
Ill hip hop, real hip hop (Northpole)
I can't let 'em steal hip hop (Southside)
I'm here 'til this shit stop (Westside)
Now get 'em up if you feel hip hop, hop (No doubt)

Blaze battle cats try to flock me out of +Ho-Hair+
Another competition for free, don't even go there
I've paid my dues, I slayed my crews
I done ripped everybody, afraid of who?
Tell HBO they gotta pay me when the jet land
Then I show the whole world that I'm the best man
Ask me, the whole thing was just a truly wack function
Crowd only cheered if one of the tracks touched 'em
Crime snapped, but it went to my man from Minneappolis
All y'all gotta feel J-U when he rappin' this
Eydea got nothin', I knew this day would come around
When networks and magizines would pimp the underground
If I sued, I could prolly gone for sure in court
What the fuck is blazin' niggas? need tour support
We can't let the bureaucracy rappers effects us (hell nah)
We gettin' raped by the cats put in posistion to protect us

This is ill hip hop, real hip hop (Midwest)
I can't let 'em steal hip hop (Eastcoast)
I'm here 'til this shit stop (Westcoast)
So get 'em up if you feel hip hop, hop (No doubt)
Ill hip hop, real hip hop (Northpole)
I can't let 'em steal hip hop (Down South)
I'm here 'til this shit stop (Westcoast)
Now get 'em up if you feel hip hop, hop (No doubt)

I think back to when I battled Super-Nat in two-thou'
Juice's first loss, what's he guna do now?
I held my undefeated rev sacrid inside
But like all real Gs, I had to take it in stride
A nigga beats me, and his flow is off key
That's when I vow, I never let 'em make dough off me
On The Wake Up, Nat was sayin' - "Juice Was Pre-Wrote"
Not knowing I'm so sick, I see the next three quotes
And I know he sound like Big, but Juice is unbelievable
You don't have to know to understand it's simply inconceivable
In this underground world, it's hard to be believed
When cats try to say your shit is pre-conceived
Nat tried to give me some advice about my flow
He gave me the ultimate respect, and didn't even know
He said - "Stop Writing Your Battle Rhymes & Freestyle More"
I just smiled and thought - "Now that's What I'll Freestyle For" (haha,y'all
Dont have no idea)

I swear I'mma always keep it real for y'all (for real)
I mean that sincerely, from the heart you know what I mean?
What's this?
