Young $ain't
Aye (x6)

Bros before hoes
Everybody knows
That’s how it goes
Bros before hoes
(x2)

These hoes ain't loyal
Me and my boys be royal
We ride around town
Heard they talking down
You know we flexin' on these bitches
Cause we playin poker seeing all the riches

You know how we know
Whippin’ in the foreign car
Pull up in a Jag
Because I got an overnight bag

Aye (x6)

Bros before hoes
Everybody knows
That's how it goes
Bros before hoes
(x2)
