New Memories:

[Verse 1: Eric Bellinger]
Why would I take you somewhere when I already been there with her and with her?
And with her, and with her, and with her, and with her, why would I?
I love Benihana’s but the one on Wilshire and La Cienaga is cursed
You know that’s it’s cursed, put this car in reverse right now

[Pre-Chorus: Eric Bellinger]
'Cause I don't wanna reminisce every time we go out
Girl, I don't need shit from the past killing our vibe

[Chorus: Eric Bellinger]
Too many memories, too many memories
Too many memories, let's make our own memories
Memories, memories, memories, memories
Memories, yeah, let's make some new memories

[Bridge: Eric Bellinger]
If I been there with a chick I used to know
I don't never go back there no more
Girl, I'll rather do brand new shit with you
So let's make some new, let's make some new new
If I been there with a chick I used to know
I don't never go back there no more
Girl, I'll rather do brand new shit with you
So let's make some new, let's make some new new

[Pre-Chorus: Eric Bellinger]
'Cause I don't wanna reminisce every time we go out
Girl, I don't need shit from the past killing our vibe

[Chorus: Eric Bellinger]
Too many memories, too many memories
Too many memories, let's make our own memories
Memories, memories, memories, memories
Memories, yeah, let's make some new memories

[Outro: Eric Bellinger]
Don't wanna see nobody else
Just you and me making stories too tell
Look at you, look at me, look how we killing them
I'm on my shit, you on your shit too, too, too
Let's make some new memories

Nobody Else:

[Intro: Eric Bellinger]
Leave the past in the past
Let's let bygones be bygones
Quick shoutout to your last

[Verse 1: Eric Bellinger]
If you never had a lame nigga, how would you have known that I'm a real one?
And if you've never had your heartbroken, how would you have learned about your feelings, girl?
If you never had to make a choice, how would you know that I'm the right decision?
How would you know? Tell me how would you know?

[Pre-Chorus: Eric Bellinger]
Baby, if you hadn't never fell in love with nobody else
If you hadn't never laid in bed with nobody else
If you hadn't never had a fight with nobody else
If you never had nobody, nobody

[Chorus: Eric Bellinger]
Baby, if you hadn't never, if if you hadn't never
If you hadn't never, if if you hadn't never
If you hadn't never, if if you hadn't never
How would know you don't want nobody else?

[Verse 2: Eric Bellinger]
The niggas you was with was corny
Posting all that dumbass shit on IG
Everything he did, he was representing you
'Cause you know your man a reflection of you, yeah
And when he used to take you to the mall, he would say, "I got you next time"
But every time that we go to mall, all I say is
All I say is you point it out, you point it out, you point it out if you want it
All I say is you point it out, you point it out, you point it out, gon' and get that
You point it out, you point it out, you point it out
All I say is you point it out, you point it out, you point it out, if you hadn't never

[Chorus: Eric Bellinger]
Baby, if you hadn't never, if if you hadn't never
If you hadn't never, if if you hadn't never
If you hadn't never, if if you hadn't never
How would know you don't want nobody else?

[Verse 3: ARoc]
Burr, it's gettin' cold ain't it?
And all them old niggas tryna creep back in your phone ain't they?
Can't tell you gone, can't they?
Thought they was it but you proud to say you wrong, ain't cha?
'Cause they ain't never made you feel like this
Tell them sorry ass niggas they could chill right quick
I got this dawg
I know you wish she still was yours but she can't help but feel it's forced
So choose on me, she will of course
Sheesh, don't mean to rub it all in your face
Put a young nigga all in your place
Don't call. just call it a day
So glad that you gave these niggas they shot
'Cause if you didn't, would you realize what you got?
Your girl said I ain't good for you 'cause she high
And 'cause her nigga, I'm not
Tellin' you just watch, baby

[Pre-Chorus: Eric Bellinger]
Baby, if you hadn't never fell in love with nobody else
If you hadn't never laid in bed with nobody else
If you hadn't never had a fight with nobody else
If you never had nobody, nobody

[Chorus: Eric Bellinger]
Baby, if you hadn't never, if if you hadn't never
If you hadn't never, if if you hadn't never
If you hadn't never, if if you hadn't never
How would know you don't want nobody else?

[Bridge: Eric Bellinger]
How would you know if you never had them?
When you with me, it's just different
How would you know if never shed tears?
That this right here must last for years, yeah
If you hadn't never (Nobody else, nobody else)
If you hadn't never had nobody, nobody

[Chorus: Eric Bellinger]
Baby, if you hadn't never, if if you hadn't never
If you hadn't never, if if you hadn't never
If you hadn't never, if if you hadn't never
How would know you don't want nobody else?
