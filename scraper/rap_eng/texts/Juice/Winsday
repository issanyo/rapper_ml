(Chorus)
I put my whole team up on my back (aye)
I told all my boys in here bro they can relax (aye)
Don’t fall for them traps (aye)
Yes I got your back (aye)
Imma run these tracks all the way until my back breaks (aye)
Man I got this money counted just like I’m an accountant (woah)
They say that I lost my groove I guess the juice just found it

(Verse 1)
All these diamonds looking west sometimes I feel im drownin
My Momma dont like the weed and dont want me around it
But eh, it is what it is, eh
Still about my biz, eh
Hero do it big, eh
Told em not to trip, eh
In the stud(io) with wiz, eh
I just bought a whip, eh
I can only win, eh
Everyday a winsday

(Verse)
I told her dont get attached, eh
She tell me she love me, girl dont have no heart attacks, uh
She be gettin mad cuz these girls that I attract, uh
Cuz they always bad and they turnt up to the max
Im Like ou, bout the play the jags, ou
Should I buy a jag too
I be popping tags too
And I be with Mad too
I just caught a mad groove and I be making mad moves
My body filled with tattoos
All these people wanna.. (Huh)
Make the juice seem like a bad dude, but what does that do
They make your boy seem like hes bad news
And one of last rules is get that money first and cash rules
And I been mad cool
But bout to go nuts just like cash shoes (Ouu)

(Hook)
They swear that Im bad news
People always thinking the juice a bad dude
They be thinking I can't ball and do the rap too
And they tell me not to talk about it but I had to (eh)

(Chorus)
I put my whole team up on my back (aye)
I told all my boys in here bro they can relax (aye)
Don’t fall for them traps (aye)
Yes I got your back (aye)
Imma run these tracks all the way until my back breaks (aye)

I put my whole team up on my back (aye)
I told all my boys in here bro they can relax (aye)
Don’t fall for them traps (aye)
Yes I got your back (aye)
Imma run these tracks all the way until my back breaks (Whoa)

X4 (All the way until my back breaks) (whoa)
