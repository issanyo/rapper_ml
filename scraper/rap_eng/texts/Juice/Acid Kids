[Verse]
I need, I need your love
Like the acid kids need the citrus sun
And all the sequins in their eyes
Come as no surprise
When they're looking at the sky
Screaming 'the world is mine'

[Pre-Chorus]
I can't take this away from you
If you want it, you need it, you see it through
I can't take this away from you
If you want it, you need it, you see it through

[Chorus]
So where you want to go
You already know
You'll never be alone
'Cause you already know

[Verse]
So lay me down
Let my body meet the ground
Don't make a sound
While my world is spinning 'round

[Pre-Chorus]
Can't take this away from me
'Cause I want it, I need it, I'm gonna be free
You can't take this away from me
'Cause I want it, I need it, I'm gonna be free

[Chorus]
So where you want to go
You already know
You'll never be alone
'Cause you already know
