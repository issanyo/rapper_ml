I've been thingking of us these days
And how we changed from the way that we were
Oh, Baby can't you feel where slipping away
And it doesn't feel the same way at all
So I say to you

Goodbye my love
Goodbye, goodbye now
Goodbye, now the happy days are over
So long and I won't shed no tears at all
No I'll put all those memories away

No more blindly believing a lie, no
I'll make it through on my own each day
Oh, Baby can't you see love turned away
It can never be the same anymore
So I say to you

Goodbye my love
Goodbye, goodbye now
Goodbye, now the happy days are over
So long and I won't shed no tears at all
No I'll put all those memories away

I never meant to hurt you, no,no
I know we failed but at least we tried
Boy you know time changes everything
So goodbye to my love
It's all that I can do
So I say to you

Goodbye my love
Goodbye, goodbye now
Goodbye, now the happy days are over
So long and I won't shed no tears at all
No I'll put all those memories away

Goodbye...this time I really mean it
Goodbye
Goodbye, now the happy days are over
So long and I won't shed no tears at all
No I'll put all those memories away

Goodbye now
Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye my love
Now the happy days are over
So long and I won't shed no tears at all
No I'll put all those memories away

Goodbye
This time i really mean it
Goodbye my love
