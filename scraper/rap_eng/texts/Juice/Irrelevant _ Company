Irrelevant:

[Verse 1: Eric Bellinger]
They be so weak when they see the way you wear that smile
If you ask me, they been hating on you for awhile
You don't even trip, you just laugh and go about your day
'Cause you know tonight, I'ma make you feel some type of way
Go tell them hoes to go and get on your level, yeah
Hop in that Beemer and smash on the pedal
They just mad 'cause they home alone
While we up late getting it on

[Chorus Eric Bellinger]
But you so unbothered (You ain't even worried though)
You so unbothered (And that's the part that's so cold)
You so unbothered, can I really blame you, look at us, yeah
Telling our story 'bout how you got cuffed
Girl, you got so much going on
So how could you ever have time to be bothered?
It's irrelevant

[Verse 2: Price]
Look, first off girl your past is irrelevant
You wear Celine with your halo 'cause your heaven sent
He said he could take you from me, I told him put his mouth by his money
The broke boy wouldn't bet a cent
That's probably why you in a real nigga bed again
You go to work in my merch, you love to represent
So be hesitant on what your friends try to recommend
They messin' with your head again, I want the love to never end

[Verse 3: Oktane]
Uh, that's real, I don't gotta front
And no I'm not thirsty just know what I want
Plus the way I take you down, grab your neck
No one in your call log seein' that, now drop down, bring it back
Never seen competition 'cause you been my baby and I been that nigga
And I hate that term but that's what I am to you
They tried to get with you, no problem 'cause you so

[Chorus Eric Bellinger]
Unbothered (You ain't even worried though)
You so unbothered (And that's the part that's so cold)
You so unbothered, can I really blame you, look at us, yeah
Telling our story 'bout how you got cuffed
Girl, you got so much going on
So how could you ever have time to be bothered?
It's irrelevant, irrelevant, irrelevant

[Outro: Eric Bellinger]
Go tell them hoes to go and get on your level
Go tell them hoes to go and get on your level

Company:

[Verse 1: Eric Bellinger]
Girl, you know you can't keep hanging with them, can't keep hanging with them
You might have to get a couple new friends, get a couple new friends
'Cause they all single, all they do is talk 'bout you and me
See girl, you can't forget that misery loves company

[Pre-Chorus: Eric Bellinger]
Oh, better for you, I see so much better for you, my baby
Better for you, I see so much better for you

[Chorus: Eric Bellinger]
Everybody can't be at the top, be at the top, be at the top, my love
Some people won't leave that block, leave that block
But that ain't your fault, nah baby
Let 'em go baby
Everybody can't be at the top, be at the top and that's where I'm taking you

[Verse 2: Yoshi]
After I drink this Hennessy, baby, I'ma have you overseas, baby
I could provide what you need, show you things you only dream, lemme put you on the scene
All of these others, all these other girls tryna be you, my love they'll never be
The one you are to me, you where I wanna be, baby, so watch your company

[Pre-Chorus: Eric Bellinger]
Oh, better for you, I see so much better for you, my baby
Better for you, I see so much better for you

[Chorus: Eric Bellinger]
Everybody can't be at the top, be at the top, be at the top, my love
Some people won't leave that block, leave that block
But that ain't your fault, nah baby
Let 'em go baby
Everybody can't be at the top, be at the top and that's where I'm taking you

[Bridge: Eric Bellinger]
I just wanna take you there (Taking you)
You gon' let me take you there?
First you gotta get rid of your friends, gotta get rid of that negative energy
I don't care if they call you boogie
If they call you boogie, most likely they ain't getting to it like you and me

[Chorus: Eric Bellinger]
Everybody can't be at the top, be at the top, be at the top, my love
Some people won't leave that block, leave that block
But that ain't your fault, nah baby
Let 'em go baby
Everybody can't be at the top, be at the top and that's where I'm taking you
