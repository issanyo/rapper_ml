[Intro: Juice]
Uh, uh, J-U in the trenches
I'm the Speaker of the House, I stays in the trenches, uh
What ya'll niggas know about battlin'?
I mean, really battlin' in the trenches
Huh?
Yea,  nothin'! thought so nigga

[Verse One: Juice]
Now through the smoke I appear, approachin' from the rear
Got the other team nervous with their coaches in fear
J-U, The dopest is here, yo forget ya eyes
Focus ya ears, these are the lyrics you been hopin' to hear
I'm in the back of the spot, and I see some niggas rappin' for props
Hopin' their albums might happen to drop
I just walk by, they never shoulda let the "rhyme sniper" in
I take it to the stage, forget the friendly ass cypherin'
I'm 'bout to make sure these rappers never touch a mic again
I'm impolite and when I really, really start to strikin' 'em
Inside of ten lines they look like they poppin' Vicadins
Break fingers to the point where rap singers never write again
I walk to the stage like I'm finna MC
Step to the cordless, it's him against me
I, pity the nigga tryna go against me
Mister J-U-I-C-E the MC

[Chorus: Juice]
In the trenches, ever since the drama begun
That's just the way it is, the way it gotta be done
I let the world know these rappers ain't as hot as me son
There's a lot of numbers out there, I gotta be one

I declare war, ever since the drama begun
That's just the way it is, the way it gotta be done
I let the world know these rappers ain't as hot as me son
First the LP, next the monopoly come

[Verse Two: Juice]
Now my opponent got skills too, I'm knowin' how dope he get
But fuckin' with big Juice, that's inappropriate
I'm on some "when-the-plane-land-I'mma-win-the-trophy" shit
Rip 'em into particles and bounce if he provokin' it
He spit first, a sick verse, it sound written
I reply with some shit that simply leave the ground splittin'
And if it was written, so what, 'cause fools love it
I can't accuse him like he wrote it, I done been accused of it
The same way, first I'm the rapper you want a piece of
Then you say it's written when all the lyrics sound cohesive
What you want me to do? dress up like you?
Fumble with my metaphors and mess up like you?
Well nigga, no can do,  Juice just release venom
That hit him in his chest before he deceased, pin 'em
For a three-count, he died on his very last night
It's a fast fight, somebody come and preach his last rite

[Chorus: Juice]
In the trenches, ever since the drama begun
That's just the way it is, the way it gotta be done
I let the world know these rappers ain't as hot as me son
There's a lot of numbers out there, I gotta be one

I declare war, ever since the drama begun
That's just the way it is, the way it gotta be done
I let the world know these rappers ain't as hot as me son
First the LP, next the monopoly come

[Verse Three: Juice]
By now I got the Judges and the crowd in a frenzy
Got Buckshot and Ras Kass laughin' at the MC
All his thoughts of hangin' wit Juice, well they were premature
He must have never seen a real MC before
I'll admit the kid was a little dope
But that don't mean I can't take this mic and slit his throat
Now the blood start gushin', paramedics they rush in
I cut off his tongue and that's the end of the discussion
I'm loud as a Glock, got the crowd in shock
This is one microphone he wasn't proud to rock
It's a live decapitation, do you really know what
It's like to see big Juice talk shit and have to face him?
I throw the guillotine, your neck catch it
And when your head's gone there's no technology out to re-attach it
To all you MC's, don't disrespect my name
And to the hundreds that I ripped apart, Rest in pain

[Chorus: Juice]
In the trenches, ever since the drama begun
That's just the way it is, the way it gotta be done
I let the world know these rappers ain't as hot as me son
There's a lot of numbers out there, I gotta be one

I declare war, ever since the drama begun
That's just the way it is, the way it gotta be done
I let the world know these rappers ain't as hot as me son
First the LP, next the monopoly come

[Outro: Juice]
Yea, uh, Molemen
P Diddy,  key to the city, nigga, yea
M.O. uh
T.N.S. in the trenches
All my niggas
Yea. J-U
