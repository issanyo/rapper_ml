I was ready, to throw up my hands
'Cause I knew love didn't love me anymore
But to my surprise your big brown eyes
Came and rescued me
Oh and it felt so good

Boy you know what you do
You make me happy
When I'm feeling low
So no matter what you believe
I'm trying to give my best
And so don't worry about the rest

::Chorus::
You know, I'm down for you love
Baby everyday, anytime you say
You know, I'm down for you love
Put your trust in me
'Cause I'm what you need

Oh baby...(You know)
I'm coming real with you
So don't worry about a thing when you're with me
I'll take good care of you
All the time
You fulfill my fantasies...hey yeah...

Boy you know what you do
I've been so happy
And you should know
So no matter what you believe
I'm trying to give my best
So don't worry about the rest

::Chorus::
Never gonna give you up
Never gonna give you up...down for your love
You know I'm down for your love

There's no doubt in my mind
What I feel for you
Baby you're worth all the time in the world
That's why I'm down for your love

::Chorus::
Never gonna give you up
Never gonna give you up

Baby you know I'm down
Baby you know I'm down
For your loving
