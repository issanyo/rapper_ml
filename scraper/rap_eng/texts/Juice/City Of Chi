[Verse One]
Skills unimagined, I'm still young and bragging
Ill when I tag 'em, I kill one and bag 'em
Use steel guns and it's real fun to drag 'em
Should've seen me in L.A., real young and sagging
Still got a fascination and infatuation
With guns and rap cats need maturation
My gat's inpatient
Ten cats are waiting
When it's jet black I just set traps and chase 'em
Squads are dead, Juice bob ya head
Cats can't rap y'all should get a job instead
I fuck hoes with the waves, beehives and dreads
Ten hut now, do what the Sargent said
Bars are spit for big body cars and whips
(And who else)
The thick hotties, broads and chicks
Roll deep when I mob, I shook you son
And I'ma roll another J before the hook get done

[Hook]
You got the mighty Mid-west in the house tonight
So
Lock your doors, turn out your lights
Thugs
Cock your fours, nigga aim 'em high
Lock shit down in the name of Chi
Chi-Town
Chi-Town give me love tonight
Cats smoke all day, hit the clubs at night
Hoes
All my ladies look pretty and fly
And it all goes down in the city of Chi

[Verse Two]
I'm back like P.E., I'm higher than ever
I'm what happen when you put herb and fire together
Flier than ever
Name brand attire forever
Catch J.U. at Bloomingdales, buying a leather
J.U. get lifted like airplane pilots
Shit the purple haze will prolly turn my brain violet
Knock knock, who is it? My Glock cock exquisite
Like Dairy Queen, niggas can not stop the blizzard
Cut from divine cloth, I get my rhymes off
Gotta pay for 16, every single line costs
I keep heats, freak beats, heat deep
Rap like I'm in a deep sleep, heat seek
Like Caravans
We the ones to Dodge
And we What's Happening now like Rerun and Rog'
Motherfucker

[Hook]

[Verse Three]
Now I'm at the studio mixing tye with herbs
Too high with words, too fly with verbs
Juice will have you looking like you been a bomb victim
I can barely hear rappers like intercom systems
Creep low (like) like niggas looking through the peep hole
Your girl was kind of shallow but the cootchie kind of deep though
And trust me, the real blunt session is next
I'm live in effect, no special effects
There's no testing the best, J. fresh in the flesh
Niggas stepping to the left, shit I'm Deffer than Jeff
So fuck it
Who's next up to battle the champ?
I'll have your ass in the corner like a halogen lamp
I'm a 100% heroin, full strength
While your snippet tape sound better than your full length
What you know about flow? peep the way I crouch low
Like the dragon
Slit a niggas throat and then I'm outro

[Hook]
