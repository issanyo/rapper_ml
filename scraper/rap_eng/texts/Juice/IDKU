Oh na na na
I take shit to the heart
You don't even know
Got my head stuck in the clouds
Wondering why I'm so so down

Ya
Girl don't act like I don’t know you
Let's not play around
Loved you from the jump
(Ya)
Loved you from the jump
(Ya)


What is your name
How do you do
Who is this lover
I don't know you

Look girl I got a lot to say
Girl you got my mind
Heavy today
Thinking about the good old
Days
Back to the head in the park
Type of days
Love thing ain’t no joke to me
Love thing got me by the throat
You see you see
Baby you see
Na na na na
Let your mind
Fade away
Fade Away
Fade away
Na na na na

(Hook)
What is your name
How do you do
Who is this lover
I don't know you

Let me down so may times before
I still want you so so bad
This Love thing got me by the
Throat you see
That's why a motherfucka  has to sing
Sing till I can't hit a other note
Sing till your man hear me on the radio
Sing till I find your loving
Sing till I hear you calling

I miss you girl
Ever single day
Single day
Single day
Single day
Single day
Single day

Na na na na

What is your name
How do you do        X5
Who is this lover
I don't know you
