[sample]
I told you before... you're too big
You're getting too big
The word has come down, it's not healthy to get too big
Now you're going to go to work for me and first thing
You're gonna do is go back on the street
You're gonna kill that brother of yours
To cool off, and I want no more attempts to pull our people off the streets

[Babyface Fensta]
Once Upon a Time in America, the Usual Suspect
Incarcerated Babyface, triple X
Stick a black and white, gangsta limelight
Disciple of the street, I serve fiends, with TNT
Out, lick a carnasaur, Hennessey, Vodka, Moet
Bacardi, females love Alize
Then mary Tihauana, for 21 years
Never smoke dope, sniff coke, pop pills
Or bang my veins, leave embalming fluid for dead people
Grew up respecting the cold
And hating the snitch, learn, at Somers Junior High
Never be a sucker for a bitch
Like Noodles, bend her over a bench, and drown her
In puddles of cum, four pounder, poom-poom
The guns in my slums go rump-a-pump-pump
At fake thugs who end up testifying

[Chorus 2X: Juice (Drastic)]
(Now what you need), team got all of that
CREAM, what you call us at
Came to get your quarterback
On the scene where the ballers at
(On the block with the cordless jacks)
Seeds, we don't call 'em back
Fiends drifting on the raps
They dream the dream

[Juice]
Firecracker, red whip, drunk driving, high as a kite
Nine in the night, hand on my nine, why even bother with life
Get in my way, you going with me, does it matter whether heaven or hell
I question religions, anything better than jail
No one to miss me, hell, my wife don't kiss me
Behind my back, people they chat, in fact, they whisper, they shifty
Luck missed me, doing a buck 50, I-9 music
Feeling my car, while I'm unlocking my belt
How all this felt, I'm doing wrong, I can just melt, so I moved on
In fact to this gun in my hand, and these, thoughts in my head
Far from a new song, and life remix, see, under I stand
Feel the breeze from the porsche when I spin
Before it's headed to Florida, officer said 'freeze'
Please, I can't raise a seed behind a glass box
So I pick a coffin instead, and this'll be my last stop, poetry popping
Impregnate your population with flow...

[Chorus 2X]

[Drastic]
I'm a hustler, so I do hustler shit
Give you a g-pack and crack the bitch out on the strip
Cuz I'm always on my grind, ain't never stressing a bitch
But I'm known for pushing bricks and emptying clips
Leave you dead in your whip, with your head pushed back
Let it be a fact, nigga I, blast what I aim at
Ain't shit sweet, nigga, ain't shit fair
If somebody gotta die, then it's you right here
Ain't a game round here, we get it down round here
Don't be a fool, and get laid down round here
I thought I told you, we don't play around down here
Put it on the block, then we shut it down round here
Dump rounds round here, loud sound round here
And please to leave, we kill cops down here
So realistically speaking, there's a war down here
And Drastic be the one, setting it off round here

[Chorus 2X]

[Buddha Monk]
Does the appearance of this cat, make you think I'm scared of death?
Does it look like pussy's written across my chest?
Then place your best, I'm Brooklyn, you shook, when we get it on
You cooked when I spit the alarm, fuck the talk, let's get it on
For the love of dough, hoes and house holding
Car notes, baby clothes, kin folk, I spit at folks
You reap what you spoke, as the heat coat your throat
Now your speech impediment nigga, leap with no talk
I ain't gangsta, but nigga, I gangsta shank frame ya
For the survival of the streets, all the east thoughts to flame
Here's a heart of gold, that's now turned cold
My back against the wall, so fuck all of ya'll
Trying to coach from the sidelines, only grieving one line
If you don't know what I've been through, stay the fuck outta mine
That's so you don't pass the white line or I will remove enzymes
One scene to the mind, lost souls left behind, damn...

I told you before... you're too big
You're getting too big
The word has come down, it's not healthy to get too big
Now you're going to go to work for me and first thing
You're gonna do is go back on the street
You're gonna kill that brother of yours
To cool off, and I want no more attempts to pull our people off the streets
