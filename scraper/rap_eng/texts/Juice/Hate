[Intro: Nili Reyy]

(Background Singing: Juice): Ohhhwhooo x 2

You know there's times that this hatred or this wrath just takes over you
And you just feel like you're ready to break in.. This is my story right here..

[Course: Juice & Annette]
I try to hide this Hate Inside //
So I can fly my way to heavenly skies //
And If I sore then I'ma fly away //
Cause when I'm gone all of my problems decay //

[Bridge: Juice & Annette]
And If I'm gone it's because I flyed away //
I'm tired of all the problems I'm just trying to get away //
And If I sore it's because I want to fly //
Live to reach my dreams because one day I'm gone die //

[Nili]: Trying to get away!

[Verse #1: Nili Reyy]
And If I fly then I'm going to reach the stars //
Do it till I can't I'm going to go so far //
Cause deep inside this life of shame we try to hide //
We just running to death so what's the given point to try //
Standing as a kid in this world all alone //
Left with dry emotions and no place of my own //
I'm stuck with no redemptions drowning deep in my lies
Trying to make a new beginning I'm only pressing rewind //
And if I sore then I'm going to fly away //
Running on a search looking out for better days //
Have no other choice but fade..
Fade away from all these problems //
And I'm trying to get away because I'm tired of this drama //

[Verse #2: Nili Reyy]
Yo Dear Nili, this song is for your hatred //
You could travel around the world and I swear you won't replace it //
You could lay with every girl and still won't even change it //
You can murder every track but still your bitter you can taste it //
So try and fly away to a place where no one finds you //
Lost within the music so deep they can't rewind you //
Be that better person that you know that they are blind to //
And make a bigger difference with your music then they try to //
Yea I'm right beside you through the thick and through the thin //
Just promise me your soul and I promise you you'll win //
Never let me go cause Il comfort you within //
Sincerely from Hip Hop your one and only friend //
