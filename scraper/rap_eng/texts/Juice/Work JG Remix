[Intro: DJJ]
Turn this shit up cause Raymore a little too quiet
JesseGang
DJ
Woo woo woo. Gone

[Verse 1: DJJ]
I'm dancing, In my, red shoes, like I'm David Bowie
(FAAAAME)
JesseGang making deals, like that nigga Howie
Still the same
Never gone change
Tell your girl she probally gone need her sheets changed
I'm sorry
Taking out dirty laundry
Like a game I got a four quarters
That's enough for a clean rinse over
JesseGang, we live by that motto puta mierda obtener dinero
Burning haters off me life Nero
Leave your fake ass camp like Zero
I'm a super man ain't talking hero
Run a crew, fuck your boo, and get kilos
Getting kilos
Making peep holes
See my people
Fucking people
Fuck the legal
I'm too real
Nah I'm just playing
Real's Rio
On that hardcore shit, no Sasha
I'm JesseGang's Obama
Shoutout X way down in Georgia
Nappy hair, like Haitians
Brother
I am

DJJ
Determined to just be Jesse
JesseGang
StaySafe.BeStrong.LiveYoungly

JesseGang, can't trust nobody
Don't need a friend, I got my hobby
Juice, P. High, and Simba ready
Leave y'all dead, like the Nazis
Gone

[Verse 2: Juice]
Okay Juice Juice Juice is on the track
All ya'll fuck niggas better hold it back
Everybody know I am fresh to death
Fly shoes fly shades
Extra wealth
When I step in the room
You gotta hold your breath
Cause you already know I am the shit
Yes I'm the sugar honey ice tea
All you other niggas try to get like me
Try to rock white tee, that shit ain't fly
If you wanna roll wit me, JesseGang or die
And I ain't Lyin , I'm just saying , ya know I ain't playin
When we step in the place ya
Excogitate if ya wanna be like us
See I take your bitch and I take your crib
Cause I be on some really nigga shit
I kill your flow
I kill your bitch
Choke her out
With this dick
Ash Bowen
Like my d
She real cool
And like to get freaky
See I make her do the juice
And got her drunk off the Booz

[Hook: A$AP Ferg]
Put in work
Put in work
Put in work
Put em in the dirt

[Verse 3: P. High]
Put in work
All my niggas sell nothing but purp
Ho ass niggas take off y'all skirts
All bad bitches make it twerk
Drop the bitch off if she gettin on my nerves
Smoke a lot of dope
Smoke a lot of herbs
Fuck niggas get whacked
Brains on the curb
My niggas be strapped fuck what you heard

Bird on my hip
That's that dessert eagle
He can feel the fonk in the air
No Beanie Sigel
Been around some niggas who find happiness in a needles
You out in the field by yourself that's a scary feelin'
Better put in work
10 toes down on yo turf
If the gun jam better make it work
Cuz my niggas gone put you in the dirt
Dick ya girl down
She say it hurt
Cause a nigga puttin in work
Leave a skinny bitch fucking broke
Thick girls I gotta work
And your bitch I got she like my polo boxers
She pull that dick out and lick that motherfucka spotless

A bobble head
She get fucked
Then she out my bed

[Hook: A$AP Ferg & Schoolboy Q]
Put in work

[Verse 4: Lil Simba]
Lil Simba stepping out of the zoo
Ain't none of y'all fucking with Jesse crew
Y'all ain't fucking with this gang
So don't let me go click clack bang bang
Fresh to death I don't need a casket
Hating on my boys man y'all some faggots
Stunting so hard I don't need a daddy
See a thick one man she's a baddy
Ha! Let me go right now
Any of y'all niggas knows me me I gets down
D double J leaving whack niggas with a frown
While Lil Simba leaving nigggs to the ground
Ugh! Don't wanna take your girl man its plenty mo
But, if I ask her to open her mouth and she nod her head yea, Well man she's a ho

I'm just a black teen wearing a black hoodie
Please don't shoot me
Now Lil Simba is out of the zoo
Now y'all know what he about to do Jesse gang we are the best
Fuck the rest deleting five like make it less
Like lay down and take a rest
Lil Simba is the best
JG on this remix work
Lil Simba like big booties that like to twerk
So you know what i gotta do gotta put in work

[Verse 5: DJJ]
I've seen a lot fakes
Stolen tapes
Stealing Grapes
Spillin shakes
Dick on 8
Give or take
Hanging; Drapes
In a bowl, call me rose
Eat your girl, no cannibal
Gone, Gone. That's DJ
Her breath come faster than Derrick Rose
Armani shades ain't cost me none
Brought the A to the Ray, like it was blind or sumn
From the Rough Draft to JesseGang
From a big head, to getting brain
But ain't nothing changed
I'm still same
Live in my flow, call it David Blane
Said forget the fame, it don't matter none
As long as my niggas turnt up
Got your girl back, I'd never front
Pop these niggas, put em in the trunk
JG, Middle finger down, cause we don't give a fuck
Twerk, slurp, put in work
