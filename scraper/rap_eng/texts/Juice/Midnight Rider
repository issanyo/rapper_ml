You know what nigga?
You acting like a little bitch right now
You actin real paranoid and shit
Now these mother f*ckers smoked your godamn cuzin
In front of you nigga
Blew his head off infront of your face
And you ain't gona do shit?
You acting like a little bitch right now nigga
Man f*ck that, I ain't lettin that shit ride
Midnight and with a crying
If you be there you'll die
Perhaps you wonder the reason why
But wait! A new day, perhaps you
Will catch the sun
I'm a midnight rider, I do my dirt off by my lonley
I keep it locate. I got that old black kay
All black mac, all black shotty with that .45 to match
A midnight rider (rider) Midnight rider (rider)
I'm in that all black craze, strapped with a cape
On the 1 oh 1 freeway ridin the drape
Havin visions of my cousin gettin shot at the light
Drunk every day cause he should be livin his life
But I'm livin for today cause u can't promise tomorrow
Tears behind the wheels, so be dealing with sorrow
The pain of my nigga just watching him die
Gettin cought up in the crossfire
And lettin them fly
But I'm a ride soon enough to feel my worth
They better shoot me cause I'm a kill them first
My nigga had a daughter a wife and a younger brother
A cousin named Juice and a beautiful grandmother
I swore to the grave I shall avenge his death
So I ride every night with a mac n a vest
I'm in revenge mode when the sun goes down
I put that on my life and my unborn child
I'm a midnight rider (wait! a new day)Midnight rider
I'm a midnight rider, I do my dirt off by my lonley
I keep it locate. I got that old black kay
All black mac, all black shotty with that .45 to match
A midnight rider, I do my dirt off by my lonley
I keep it locate. I got that old black kay
All black mac, all black shotty with that .45 to match
A midnight rider (Rider) midnight rider(Rider)
I seen lots of killed before, but I ain't never done it myself
I mean I never had a reason too
When they killed my cousin, I knew I was gonna kill them
