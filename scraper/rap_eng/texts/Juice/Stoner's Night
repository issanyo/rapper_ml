Hold up man, hold up man
Juicy J from Taylor Gang
Rolling fat, I'm rolling dank
Green cologne, I know it stank
Light it up and pour a drank
Hit the club blowing bank
Say you is but I know you ain't
GETTING MONEY, no you ain't
Rollin Cali green in a zig-zag paper
SMOKING on the back porch, who the damn neighbors
LOOKING FOR a chick who just wanna have fun
Let her hit the joint and put love on her tongue
Inhale, exhale, go to jail, I'm posting bail
Blue Dream, I know it well
So much green I'm gonna sell
Ounces on ounces, my CONNECT he got the deal
And he give me nothing but that ill, it's stoners night for real

She rolling weed and she don't even SMOKE, even SMOKE
She rolling weed and she don't even smoke, even smoke

Young Wiz, people call me young Wiz
Roll up 20 zig-zags outta one zip
Niggas smoke zags over blunts
Better blunts smokers smell whats in my bag he gonna want a hit
Since a young nigga I was getting lit
Riding in my black bonnaville bumping Three Six
Serving no seeds, nigga no sticks
Used to be the one rolling weed for my whole click
Now I'm buying weed on some grown shit
When I say grown I'm talking bout the man who grows it
Looking at my ring, look like I froze it
I'm smoking good in here so everybody knows it

I'm riding with my top back
My bitch drunk I'm smoking weed
I don't know if they for real but she got double d's
Hand me two cups, you gotta double these
I don't put it on if it ain't double g
In the Rolls Royce chiefin on the trippy stick
I'm boutta transform, take her home and give her dick
Trippy trippy mane, I'm a specialist
If I let you hit the vape then you a special chick
Kief in the joint, I've been saving up
I'm bout to buy a jet, I've been saving up
All the money I've been touching, I'm getting paper cut
Ever since I put the blunts down I've been papered up
