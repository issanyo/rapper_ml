[Interlude 1: Punchline]
Yeah, yeah, what, what?  (Yeah) Repping for Unknown, (Punchline, Wordsworth), Mek.  (Yo) For Brothers on the Slide (Check it.  What?  Check it out).  Yo, yo

[Verse 1: Punchline]
Bodies decaying.  I told you before to stop playing
To test this is senseless like water weighings
Need cheese, go to war like Lebanese
On emcees.  Since a child, you had gay tendencies
I could  tell by the scuff on your knees that you swallow
My crew get high, hit trees like Sunny Bono
We create from crates to gold plate
I’m WordPerfect.  You’re micro, soft/Microsoft like Bill Gates
I’ll create music for the lyrically starving
End your career, make you convert to robbing
It was said that your girl was good in bed
But her teeth always got in the way when she gave head
Enough said.  Fake players make me laugh
I’ll get ass with or without cash
My whole staff be army fatigue like M*A*S*H
And I’m not that nice.  Y’all niggas is trash
First pick in the draft.  Just begun bubbling
In the streets, we’re rumbling for your jewels and your publishing
Crooked like Republicans.  “A born master
Blast ya”—put that on every dead rapper
Never drink at the bar, but take your girl on vacation
Now, every time you kiss, that’s my dick you’re tasting
Your spot taken.  Punchline get cheese
Leave you cats shook like Parkinson disease (Come on)

[Bridge 2: Samples with Scratches by DJ Unknown and DJ Mekalek]
"I'll rip mics" - Sample from Punchline on Punchline and Wordsworth - "Da Cipher”
"Freaky like two dykes" - Sample from Punchline on Punchline and Wordsworth - "Da Cipher”
“J.U.I.C.E., I’ll serve any nigga breathing in the industry” - Sample from J.U.I.C.E. - "Period"

[Interlude 2: J.U.I.C.E.]
Uh huh.  For Unknown.  J-U-Ill-Stink.  For the fam to trip (Rip it).  Punchlines, J-U finna set it

[Verse 2: J.U.I.C.E.]
Hey, I embarrass emcees.  I’ll let the track rumble
I’m well-known for making hard rappers act humble
I’ll give you the mic, then I’ll take it back from you
I’ll freestyle perfect.  Most rap acts stumble
All these rappers talking ‘bout their crew and their accomplishments
Be the same niggas selling tapes at all the conferences
Then you mistake all my confidence for pompousness
I’m dropping this.  Niggas is wack and I’m the opposite
J.U.I.C.E.’ll step to any and every—skinny and heavy
Dodge truck, GMC Jimmy, or Chevy
I’m venomous.  Your worse nemesis is on the premises
My penmanship rip all comers—I’m indiscriminant
I rose to my pinnacle just by being cynical
My sickness’ll never be cured because it’s clinical
And, to you emcees, if you think we got issues
If I don’t say your name, kid, I’m not trying to diss you
I’ll do it to your face—I’ll never do this shit subliminal
And once you see me ready to cock, that’ll be the end of you
You need to get a oracle to be this metaphorical
Who could kick a better story, yo, or editorial?
Shit, the better the beat, the better the rhyme.  It’s
Set in my mind.  I’m probably just ahead of my time
From this mixtape to CDs, can’t nobody find me
I’m still kicking shit that I wrote way back in ‘90
J.U.I.C.E

[Interlude 3: Sample from The Notorious B.I.G. - "Party and Bullshit"]
Partygoer #1: Ay, ay, yo.  Yo, B, what’s up?  Yo, B, what’s up?  Yo, B, what’s up?
Partygoer #2: What happened?
The Notorious B.I.G.: Chill.  Yo, chill, man, chill

[Bridge 3: Samples with Scratches by DJ Unknown and DJ Mekalek]
“Who is that?” - Sample from [?] - “[?]”
“Eddie Brock, shit, so why the hell not?” - Sample from Eddie Brock - “[?]”

[Verse 3: Eddie Brock]
Yeah.  The new
Rap world door, the enforcer.  My flows is ice water
Torture—feel the brain freeze.  Rap celebrity
Stalker, harassing star-status emcees
‘Cause I’m obsessing with making their necks my main squeeze
Man, please.  You’ll be hooked up to strange machines
Sipping strained peas through IVs.  Do physically
Maim to I.D.  Diagnosed clinically
Insane to try me.  Critically acclaimed is
My steez, so I’ll cynically exclaim that I be
Mr. Brock—first name E-double-D-I-E.  My reps
A step past H.I.V.—full-blown.  Hundred
Percent of everything I speak you’ll clone.  Yeah
I’ll pull chrome microphones—verbal marksman
With my vocal chamber revolving, turning your thug
Barking to slug-dodging, spitting sentences by the
Squads and fully armed with jargon, barging
Through loose leaf margins, so if you’re marked, then
Sergeant, yell about faith and keep marching
Before you test these waters, you’re better off embarking
On a far swim in an ocean full of sharks’ fins
What?

[Outro: Eddie Brock]
Word.  The final cypher, baby.  Eddie Brock, J.U.I.C.E., Punchline.  Yo, this for the dogs up in here, the Bronx, boy.  What’s y’all know about that?  What’s y’all know about that Unknown?  What’s y’all know about DJ Mek?  You don’t know?  Too late ‘cause it’s over
