It's three o'clock and I just can't stop
Loving you inside of my head
This fantasy is not enough for me
I'd rather have you here instead

I know I told you, I just wanted to be friends
But something changed inside of me
And I can't pretend
Now I've got this secret I want to share
I'd like to take you there
If I dare

I've been dreaming about you every night
I lie awake and I hold my pillow tight
And I've een thinking baby
That I might
Invite you to my bed

You call me up
But the phone feels so cold, yeah
Pressing up against my ear
I wonder if it would be too bold
If I asked you to come over here

But everytime I try to tell you how I feel
Something's taking over me
And I just can't speak
Ever since you came into my dreams, baby
I see you differently

I've been dreaming about you every night
I lie awake and I hold my pillow tight
And I've een thinking baby
That I might
Invite you to my bed

Thinking 'bout
Thinking 'bout
At night I toss and turn around
I lie awake because of you, oh baby
