If ever you want, I will do it for you
If ever you need, I will do it for you
If ever you ask of me, to prove my love is true
I will do it for you

If I was the sun, you'd be my light
If I was the moon, you'd be my night
There's nothing on earth that can
Compare to what we have
If you need some love, I've lots to share
Just ask me for proof, boy I don't care
So show me the way that I can prove
My love is true

If ever you want, I will do it for you
If ever you need, I will do it for you
If ever you ask of me, to prove my love is true
I will do it for you
I will do it for you

If I was wrong, you'd make me right
Sometimes I'm blind, you are my sight
If ever I lose my way, you'd show me where to go
So if you want the moon, I'll bring it here
A trip to the stars, I'll take you there
There's nothing beyond my means if it
Shows you that I care
If ever you want

If ever you want, I will do it for you
If ever you need, I will do it for you
If ever you ask of me, to prove my love is true
I will do it for you

I guess that's just the way things are
('Cause your in my mind and heart)
And nothing that you ask for is too far
Ooh if ever you want

Whatever you want, whatever you need
You can believe, you'll get it from me

Whatever you want, whatever you need
You can believe, you'll get it from me

I will do it for you
I will do it for you
