We do it like that for those who wanna step to this
Swing a flow like a fist cuz Chi Town don't miss
Straight rockin the mic when brothas get tight as a fist
Death is over with this Blahzeeblah you first on the list

(Blahzeeblah)
I feel lessly effective
Why did you think we call it Blahzee
Pass me the martinini and rossi
I see slang stock sentence back on my apprentices and pupils
Even loop holes will tie slip knots and screw holes
Blahzee is the phrase that rocks
With more interaction than a box of just to plush
Exotic so adjust
Axin more clans than a mumble keepin dips styles deluxe
Check this out we sippin on Moet with loot to boot

(Com)
Lookin glamourous down shaker is supa sonic
Hookin phonics like A and G the 360 makes shit so complete
So how you livin 90 emcee in 1983
With corny conduct get stomp and you a bitchin
Enterin the masters son sendin suckas on like missions
Yeah nigga

(chorus)
We do it like that for those who wanna step to this
Swing a flow like a fist cuz Chi Town don't miss
Straight rockin the mic when brothas get tight as a fist
Death is over with this Twista you next on the list

(Twista)
Huh, I draw more blood than a vampire with a paint brush
Makin 'em fake plus
Decapitate niggas who can't bust
The nashtatonish, mothacomish more shot to honors
I predict victories like Nastradamus apost his promise
Never to step into deciphers that put their brain in waters
Where pain is flawless
For me emcee's go get restrainin orders
It don't matter cuz when my shottie flags
Follow seize of hollow weed
Pick a sequel out of trick or treat with body bags
Body tags get blast out like druggles blast out like mugglets
Causin abombinations, crackin heads like safe combinations
I condination into I get 'em blessed
Kill 'em all off like David Koresh
Just to play with the flesh, vest of the best
The type of nigga that'll cut your break lines
Ache lines, and break spines
Scramble up quick to shit thats heard through grape vines
My skill shines, I drop emcee's in abis
When Twist flicks his wrist
Get the fuck down Chi Town don't miss

(chorus)
We do it like that for those who wanna step to this

Death is over be here D.A. you next on the list

(D.A. Smart)
Ohh wee, it's the terror turn
Plus I never burn like real gold
Plus I always in the pocket like a bill fold
And you can spend me, till the men see, what a friend be
But offend me thats the end G
Plus I love life, I hug mics, and I mug whites
Cuz Im sick of seein black fuckin thug fights
Thats the man game, we just playin lame
I'm not sayin names, but look brotha thats a dam shame
We got it together now
Makin it better now
For a better sound
And we takin it to the letter now
M-Dot, Tung Twista, and Blahzeeblah

Like jacks I snatch ya arms off your ass from your elbow
Cuz I get his like, do what you lives like, and give you insight
And plus I rock the mic rizz night

Yeah check it out
If I can get you with this track I'mma get you with this flow
Tie your ass up if you still say no
And make you listen to what you missin
Cuz it's so appetizin your ass ain't recognizin
The funk, the flava, look at what I gave ya
Comin from in the soul M-Dot is here to save ya
Not a super hero yo I never wore again
But a thousand men on that ass it'll be hard to escape
Like the chi I'm cold ,treat like a bowl, of cereal
Usin cheerio, I gots milky material
For that ass every single line I kick is straight
I can fart on this mic and it'll come out great
I'm snappin like road necks
And niggas with no techs and women throw up techs
Anihlate your pupils dialate whos ready to flow next
An entrepreneour racona sewer
You better acknowlege me give me an apology
Cuz I'm a prodigy of the Chi

(J.U.I.C.E.)
MC J.U.I.C.E is harzardous
There ain't no rapper bad as this
I leave for 3 days I come back just like the Nazerath
The insane headerole
I think these rappers betta go
Run and get medical attention when I severo
I tell 'em never go against me this is no tow zone
And I'mma bout get this bitch open like the ozone, layer
Cuz you is gots prop like the mayor
I can meet a cutie pie in 20 minutes I'mma play her
You can say your little whips so I can fiddle with your game plan
I'm insane stand, toe to toe now get the same dam, treatment
I gotta tell 'em tell me where the weed went
Rewind it brotha bring it back so I can find it
I could rip punks up
We come in three just like the chipmunks
I kick for these rappers better float on or they get their ship sunk
Ugh, they battle ship is not made for mic rippin
You just a rude boy so ease up off the champagne your sippin
Your trippin I even played hoops with Scottie Pippen
He missed the dunk I had to follow with the tip in
I rippin niggas bet chip in for the beer run
I come into your ear drums you thought my flow was near done
