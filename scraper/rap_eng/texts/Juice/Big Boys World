[Intro: Juice]
Yeah, yeah

[Juice] (Crave)
Now you see that black 'Lac with the speakers in the front
That's a pimp ride, it come with four heaters in the trunk
Eighteens on lean, cuz the strip's a bitch
It'll get you from A to B, but the CD skips
(I need something with more power) Alright, the Eddie Bauer
(Explorer or Expedition) It depends, what you chip in?
(I got dough for days, though) So why ain't you say so?
I got three Denalli's, an Escalade and four Range Rov's
(What's poppin'?) Nah, what's droppin', six four and hatings
And a G on dubs, all install PlayStation
I save 'em for my ballers, but I like your style
And if your money can hold a conversation, we might be pals
(I don't need friends, I need a Benz) You might of just got signed
Already to spend your money, and your check ain't dry
Peep, Miss Sweet Piece, two thousand and three, like
A leading mother, standing still like Brian McKnight
She acting innocent, she Dominican?
Sho be shaking like a Jamaican to get up in (We'll I'll take that)
Ok, black, you talking long dough, with bread in short pockets
Plus, you don't look that strong, so, you know, you need the weight
Got the gate (Not that late) Well, hey, you need the skate
We talking 45 for the whip, and 10 for the title
And a prayer from the bible to pray you don't get jacked
Cuz you'll be the only muthafucka on your block with that

[Chorus 2X: Juice]
It's a big boys world, and we conducting business round here
Ya'll don't like it, you can take your business down there
You better respect us guys, you must of just got signed
Already to spend your money, and your check ain't dry

[Crave] (Juice)
Listen dog, I sell and smoke lots of the weed
Good thing you came down here, cuz I got what you need
My name Crave, what up, I specialize in trees
First time, free, light that up, get high on me
What you trying to get? (Some of that, Hawaiian shit, or that dro)
That'll make you fly off a cliff (shit is good)
I know, I see you gaggin' and shit
Come on nigga, that's it, pass me my spliff
I got twenties of the haze, and fifties of the choco
(I heard if weed was carrots, you'd be Bugs Bunny of the projects)
You must of just got signed, already to spend your money
I feel you, you wanna get high (yup)
Shit get hot, I gotta get off this block
Give me what you got, and I put the weed in the ziplock
Here's my number, dog, if you wanna try some blueberry
I'm cool very, I be another bed with blue cherry, like this

[Chorus 3X]

[Hook: Buddha Monk]
You don't like what I'm saying, go elsewhere
You don't like what I'm saying, go elsewhere
You don't like what I'm saying, go elsewhere
You don't like what I'm saying, go elsewhere

[Chorus 2X]
