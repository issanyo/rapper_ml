(Intro: Mediumjay)
Get the fuck off my couch, Nigga!

(Hook: Mediumjay)
Couch Guy back!
Couch Guy back!
That's all these bitches screaming that couch guy's back
All eyes on me, While I'm up in yo house
My drink ain't got no coaster and my feet on yo couch, Nigga!
(2x)

(Verse: Mediumjay)
Pass them Cheetos, Doritos
Empty wrappers from Taquitos
Gained a couple kilos, gettin' really comfy doe
Man I popped open some pringles, Those crumbs end up on yo shingles
Bro can you pass your laptop I'm tryna log onto Christian Mingle
Man I overstayed my welcome, been here bout 5 weeks
Haven't moved an inch every time you've seen me
My eyelids don't blink whenever I watch yo T.V
Hey what's up how's it going that's the extent when we speak
When I do get up to take a piss theres a permanent imprint
Of my body sorry you had a party and I haven't left since
Yo controllers got them orange markings from my finger prints
Don't nobody use the bathroom for bout 45 minutes
Okay, you probably hate me now, but you used to like me
Every time you open the fridge, Half inch of Iced Tea
Blasting my music every time you tryna sleep
Never bought no groceries every time I eat for free
Started wearing yo jeans cause they fit me perfectly
Yo girl friend in the kitchen making grits
Well ask her to make some for me!

(Hook)

(Verse 2: Juice)
RING A DING DONG
I open up the door
To this nigga asking to sleep on my couch like where you from nigga?
He comes in anyways without my permission
With my daughter and I see them kissing
Sleeping on my couch all day and all night
I say get out my house you fuckin couch guy!
Chase him out the house he got a nappy fro
He comes back the next day like the cat and the thimble
Nigga, Da cat came back, The very next day
So did the couch guy but he was here to stay nigga!

(Hook)

(Verse 3: Mediumjay)
It's yo family reunion, You tossed a blanket over me
They still notice me the way I snore in my sleep
Man, My shirt ain't never on and I started skyping with yo mom
We laughing cracking jokes how you forget to mow da lawn

(Beat: Lil Wayne)
An' yo nigga a ho)

(Outro: Mediumjay)
