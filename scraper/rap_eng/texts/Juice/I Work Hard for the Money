[Preacherman]
Well I jump in my ride around 9 or 10
Going to the house to pick up my cousin
We going to the club
I was going there to meet my girl
Oh now, what to my suprise
Seen my girl hooked up with another guy
He was rubbing on her thighs
I guess he was trying to take what's mine
I was thinking, should I bust him up
Then put his body in the trunk, and dump, but
The God said chill
And I said, homey I will, but still

[Chorus 2X: Preacherman]
Tonight is gonna be me or him
This time I plan to win
Cuz I work hard, for the money
I don't bring nobody like you, honey

[Preacherman]
She tried to play you, playa
She couldn't play you, play you, God
And nothing that can save her
Now back to the storyline...
I just take it one more time
Well I stepped to her with the definite style
She was trying to figure me out, but
She was afraid, but I was in love, yo
I could tell by the look in her eyes
I caught her by suprise
There were no more lies
And she's running out of time
So I looked at her and said
Baby, girl, what you gonna do?
I'm bout to be through with you

[Chorus 2X]

[Buddha Monk] (Juice)
What you need to say.. checkmate, game, oh no
Yo, bad, she flipped it wrong, the Preach doctor pimp game strong
(Tight like vice grips, word, remove her thong
She spread like eagle, when the bed, whipped cream on)
She said 'lord oh lord', I thought she was reading the psalm
But she's another Eve, bad apple, eating it raw
(Aiyo, Buddha, you try'nna tell me, she freak when he gone)
Eat meat when he's gone, and a shake booty freak when he's gone
Backyards and cars, getting it on
(And what you think, that people will do when they find out she getting it on)
Make homey leak and beat her from dusk til dawn
(Well, birds of a feather, nigga, flock together)
Not when the peeps involved, it's clap whenever (stay in the leather)

[Chorus 3X]
