Chorus
Well I need Jesus, you need Him too
Along Life's highways
To carry you through
When you're in trouble
And don't know what to do
Coll on Jesus, Jesus, Jesus
He'll carry you trough
He'll carry you trough
Sometimes I'm discouraged
My load's hard to bear
And I feel myself stumble
'Neath my load of care
Then I ask Him this question
Oh my Lord, how long?
Then I hear His voice
Whisper, whisper, wisper
Soon you'll be coming home
Repeat Chorus
You'llbe coming home
