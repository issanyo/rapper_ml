(Intro: Stewie)
Damn, We really on this shit
2Socks... Big Jay... Stewie
We gettin'

(Hook)

(Verse 1: Stewie)
Damn do I miss this bitch
Mary how you been you been?
She be choking up my lungs while she blowin in tha wind
Room is really hazy, these thoughts keepin amazin'
Munchies what I'm cravin', In my place of Haven

(Verse 2: 2Socks)
Money's on my mind but smoking takes my time
You can smoke yo kush I'm a smoke mine
I be on the purp shit you be rollin dirt kid
If you need to find me you can find me with my stoner clique

(Verse 3: Stewie)
Umm, Damn I'm high, If you can smell it on my clothes
Then you can see it in my eyes
Purple in the leaf, Tell me can you breathe?
You be coughing up a lung you can feel it when you run

(Hook)

(Verse 4: 2Socks)
I be about them blue ZigZags
When I buy kush I be buyin by the bag
When I'm super baked, My voice like to lag
By 8 am 2Socks is blazed!

(Verse 5: Stewie)
I let her blaze but don't say that I'm a pot head
They say this beat was live, Until I had it shot dead
Leave it it my gas tank, Inhaler relief
Stress wielding the ashtray I'm higher than the geese

(Verse 6: Juice)
No I am not pot head but I do got my moments
Give me a crack at the joint and yes I'm a own it
If I get way to high I feel my mind fallin off course
Wake up from a great night and still don't feel no remorse

(Hook)

(Verse 7: Stewie)
Always blaze a spliff and sip on a couple goose
Never ever catch me sober when I'm spittin in the boof
No it's nothing new I just be spittin low key
But all this blowing weed I'm blazin got me cravin roti
That's my Trini colours wave a flag with such pride
Don't sorry for you niggas cause we all got tough lives
That's why I sip tequila, Bad broads I don't need her
That's the real fuckin' reason I be smokin on this reefer

(Verse 8: Juice)
I get hign....
(Stewie: But that's no surprise)
Got to understand I got money to provide
Broke nigga status but till then we rising high
One day we'll be thrown but till then we scrappin' by
