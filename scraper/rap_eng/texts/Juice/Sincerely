(Juice)
Sometimes tha illest cats don't get record deals (laugh)
Sometimes the illest cats roam the streets....
Underground legends
Cats you never heard of
But everybody know they tha nicest
This is for them cats....

When I design rhyme in daylight
Or primetime I stay tight
I walk the fine line between an emcee and a play right
I represent the underground world, it's a unique scene
There's no record deals, no videos and street teams
I do shows to keep green
I know I'm not a star man, I'm signed to myself
And my mic's my A&R man
In double nine I guess it's just a sign of tha times
The spotlight that I've been looking for is finally mine
I never thought about the dough when I'm designing my rhyme
As long as I can reach my peoples over vinyl I'm fine
It ain't about that
I opened up for cats who ain't as dope as me
While I rip the flow, they lips sink, the show hopelessly
From Heaven I was set to game to entertain
I may never pimp that '75 ta cop that blue range rover
But even if I don't remain sober
I'mma score double digits till the fuckin' games over

"Whether they signed or unsigned" (Canibus)
"Platinum more wax for..platinum in tha streets" (Redman)

I don't care if I'm right, wrong , or in between
All night long I pimp tha scene they said I couldn't write songs
I intervene
Don't think because the battle rhymes are what I'm know for
I can't out write the best of em, or rip the microphone
Raw my words are deep
Keep my tape handy when you're buzzin
Let my thoughts deep inside ya dome
Tell a cousin or friend play my CD when you guzzlin' Gin
Come down but then recite it when you buzzin' again
You must respect the flow
Point blank I'm a professional
Exceptin' no less than excellence, that's how tha session go
Embracin' my Rhyme, when I'm gone who's replacin' mine?
I trace a line that transcend all space and time
I implement infinite lyrics that are intricate
The type of shit discussed my mob bosses eatin' shrimp and shit
Those with intellect they understand how I wrote it
But the average mind can take 5 years to decode it

Chorus: (scratched)
"Whether they signed or unsigned" -Canibus
"Platinum more wax for..platinum in tha streets" -Redman

Gradually I drift off imagining me
The baddest emcee, wondering what my status will be
A little local battle emcee who never made the grade?
Or a gifted lyricist who used to spit with razor blades?
Ever time I win the battles they dissected my words
I'll probably never get the props or the respect I deserve
The magazines claim I wrote my battle rhymes like they knew me
Then they wanna call the next day and fuckin' interview me
Do I really have props?
Is it really that stable
When they ask me to freestyle when I walk up into labels?
When they take me for lunches and drinks inside they limos?
And fu#k around and play me somebody else's demo
J-U ya'll niggas all know what his name is
The Cat that got famous
By never being famous
I'll probably roam the underground scene for all times
Signed sincerely JUICE the unsigned

"Whether they signed or unsigned" -Canibus
"Platnum more wax for..platnum in tha streets" -Redman
