I'm not trying to pick fun
But why peoples mouth work
Like it got the runs
People so quick to bring you down when you up
Guess that’s  a quick sum-mary Of whats to come
But I really don't give a fuck because I am blessed
I really got to  play life like it's god dam  chess
Cause Niggas try to get me in check mate
But turned it around and said check this mate
Here we go
Bet you like if I poped off
"at the mouth "
Bet you like it
If I popped off at the
Huh
But really I stay reserve
Keep my head low and observe
I just put in the work
Half Y'all niggas don't really impress
None of Y'all niggas don't bring me stress
Cause give me one melody I have your girls heart beating out her godam chest

Hook :
You mad causeI'm feeling so high
You  mad cause you feeling so low
But I guess that's how the universe works
That shit coming out your mouth
That shit Don’t work



Look I rember when I was once in your shoes
Trying to see this vision threw
Young juice
I wanted to be a ball player
I wanted shine
360 through the legs
From the free throw line
Dam well that maybe a reach
But my ambition got me feeling
Like I’ll never peak
This music shit is just what I really bleed
I moved out the house made something of myself
That's why if you hating you could go fuck your self
Take your diss
11:11 better make your wish
Well I stay on my grind
Puting my words in actions
Well you still trying to faction
If you got it but you don't
You do best on street Making a living giving dome
Can't handle 1hunna
Then leave me alone
Little bitch


Hook : you mad causeI'm feeling so high
You  mad cause you feeling so low
But I guess that's how the universe works
That shit coming out your mouth
That shit Don’t work


Sorrry that I'm feeling so high
Sorry that you feeling so low
But I guess that's how the universe works though
Talking shit behind my back that's
A low blow
