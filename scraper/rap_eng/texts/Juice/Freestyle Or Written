[Verse 1]
I freestyle erratically for those that wanna battle me
Spit venom at MC's until this mic cord is staticky
Do damage to a salt and a pepper, without the battery
When you diss you flatter me, I'm fuckin' up your whole anatomy
The tan tenor, oh your hoe... we ran in her
With thirteen king size chocolate antennas
And in my city, for reals yo I'm sick of who talk
About how me and my man is on the dick of New York
'Cause when I innovate, I incinerate then I eliminate
You in a state of shock until these niggas hyperventilate
I serve the east coast to west coast and won't discriminate
Penetrate, I crush all beef right where it emanate
In daylight my stray mic strike the twilight
And I'mma stay tight, playwrite, create highlights
And ain't nobody finna do me, especially in this bitch game
I'm ruthless, I use my middle finger when I switch lanes
Pertainin' to bein' entertainin', now I'm rainin'
I slay men, experts and laymen with my grey pen
I'm scrapin', remotely holding rap down and shapin'
A style handcrafted since the days of my playpen
In my drop-top, I rock spots, I got it lock stocked
When my Glock pop, I had the hardest niggas playin' hop-scotch
I'm top notch, and if she ain't fuckin' then watch me cock block
I hit hot twat, and pop-lock, hey nigga knock knock
I'm enterin', Juice's shit is colder than the winter and
These instumentals bang and leave a nigga's skin splinterin'
"Friday the 13th" I rip Jason
A slick Mason like Perry with more game than Dick Grayson
Perfection, rap erection, now let my TECs in
I burn your neck skin, these niggas start epilepsin'
Juice steps in, and If a motherfucker test us
They scrapin' his ass of the wall like asbestos

[Hook]
I just freestyle the hook and display my skills
No matter what a nigga kick you'll be on my deals
Get your notebook, quote, it's time to take notes
Can't fuck with the freestyles or what I got wrote
Swear to god I just rip it and freestyles my skills
And everything I kick is dope so they'll be on my deals
And when I get done with the song you'll think I'm bullshittin'
'Cause you won't know if it's freestyle or if the shit is written

[Verse 2]
Niggas swear to god they finna rip the microphone
I swear they couldn't go gold if they bought a herringbone
They'd need kneepads, lookin' at my style 'cause I'mma be bad
I swear it's so dope, I had to check into a rehab
Never nervous, MC's are worthless, put down your pencil
My instrumental, will cramp your style like a menstrual
Scenario, it's time for your motherfuckin burial
I'll murder you and burn your promotional material
Kinetically and alphabetically, I'm the thickest
And theoretically, poetically, (cough) I'm the sickest
My bic is, scribblin', yo it ain't no ritalin
If rap was defense, I'd have Kobe double dribblin'
I'll leave this mothafucker so hot, it'll be sizzlin'
I haven't even started my reign, I'm only drizzlin'
I'm unpresentable like pierced needles through your genital
In general, I'm known for stealin' shows like a criminal
I'm crucial, mathematically I'll reduce you
I'll noose you, I'll shoot your posse even if they neutral
Yo, don't drink and drive when you choosin' my tape
It's like, cruisin' on the freeway and losin' your brakes
And the crash will be a crash that will thrash your ass
I'll harass these motherfuckers from the first to the last
There's no immunity, when my tape hits the black community
Niggas will put the crack down and start usin' me
My shit injures, average men down to ninjas
My tape so dope, it should've came with two syringes
I blend this, with no glitches for all your bitches
Last time I got so open, I needed stitches
When every nigga in they Accent Hyundais heard this
I leave niggas quieter than Sunday service
I can burn any nigga steppin' in my jurisdiction
Big Juice, I'm in the house like a shorty on restriction

[Hook]
I'm like Schwarzenegger when it's time to erase
These niggas talk behind my back but they be all up in my face
If I do kick a written rhyme for your instant bonus
I'll make you change your name to "The Rapper Formerly Known As"
So next time please just get off my deals
And let me do whatever and display my skills
'Cause no matter if it's freestyle, no matter if it's written
I'm a dope nigga, that's no bullshittin'
