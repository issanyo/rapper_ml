Am I happy - maybe not
But I never wanna lose what I got
I wouldn't trade it for anything dear to my heart, oh no
You take the good times with the bad
How else would you know happy from sad
Sooner or later
You gonna have to finally look back

And you'll look back and see
What happened in between
And you'll appreciate
Each and every single day

The pop of the cork
And the cling of the glasses
We toast to the future
And we drink to the past
It might not be easy
But nevertheless
These are the best days (of our lives)

Sometimes the weather can be rain
But one day it will be sunny again
Without the clouds of life
It's just another sunny day

The pop of the cork
And the cling of the glasses
We toast to the future
And we drink to the past
It might not be easy
But nevertheless
These are the best days (of our lives)

These are the times
That I will never forget
These are the best days (of our lives)

And you'll look back and see
What happened in between
And you'll appreciate
Each and every single day

The pop of the cork
And the cling of the glasses
We toast to the future
And we drink to the past
It might not be easy
But nevertheless
These are the best days (of our lives)

It might not be easy
But nevertheless
These are the best days of our lives
