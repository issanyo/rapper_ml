[Intro]
Ayy yo!
I got some new shit for y'all tonight
Oh yes
See, it's the nigga named Nas
And he kick it with these niggas named Mobb Deep
And they kick it with some niggas named Bad Boy
I sent this out to Nas...

[Automatic gunshots]

...and anybody else down with that clique
We still Bad Boy killas
Y'all don't feel us

[Verse 1]
Menacin' methods, label me a lethal weapon
Makin' niggas die witnessin' breathless imperfections
Can you picture my specific plan?
To be the man in this wicked land, underhanded hits are planned
These scams are plotted over grams and rocks
Outlawz motherfuckers die by the random shots
We all die in the end, so revenge we swore
I was all about my ends, fuck friends and foes
Me, a born leader, never leave the block without my heater
Got me a dog and named her "my bitch nigga eater"
What could they do to me, you lil' brat?
Shit, them niggas that shot me is still terrified I'll get they ass
How can I show you how I feel inside?
We Outlawz, motherfuckers can't kill my pride
Niggas talk a lot of shit, but that's after I'm gone
‘Cause they fear me in the physical form
Let it be known I'm troublesome

[Chorus]
Na, na, na, na, na, na
Na, na-na na, nahhh
Na, na, na, na
All you niggas die

[Verse 2]
Gutter ways, my mentality is ghetto
We guerrilla in this criminal war, we all rebels
Death before dishonor, bet I bomb on 'em first
Niggas knew we came for murder, pullin' up in a hearse
Westside was the war cry, bustin' off freely
Screamin', "Fuck all y'all niggas!" in Swahili
Pistol packin', fresh out of jail, I ain't goin' back
Release me to the care of my heartless strap
Say my name three times like Candyman
Bet I roll on yo' ass, like an avalanche
A sole survivor, learned to get high and pull drive-bys
Murder my foes, can't control my nine
Hearin' thoughts of my enemies pleadin', "please"
Busta-ass motherfuckers tried to flee
Picture me lettin' this chump survive
Ran up on his ass, when I dumped he died
‘Cause I'm troublesome

[Chorus]
Na, na, na, na, na, na
Na, na-na na, nahhh
Na, na, na, na
All you niggas die

[Verse 3]
"Murder, murder, my mind state," shit ain't changed
Since my last rhyme; the crime rate ain't decline
Niggas bustin' shots like they lost they mind
Like 25 to life never crossed they mind
Tell me young nigga never learned a thang
Dead at thirteen ‘cause he yearned to bang
Sent a lot of flowers, but how could I cry?
Need to stop the gang bangin', "Either stop or die."
Mercy is for the weak, when I speak I scream
Afraid to sleep, I'm havin' crazy dreams
Vivid pictures of my enemies, family times
Lord, forgive me ‘cause it's wrong, but I plan to die
Either take me in Heaven and understand I was a sheep
Did the best I could, raised in insanity
Or send me to Hell, ‘cause I ain't beggin' for my life
Ain't nothin' worse than this cursed-ass hopeless life
Nigga, we're troublesome

[Chorus]
Na, na, na, na, na, na
Na, na-na na, nahhh
Na, na, na, na
All you niggas die

[Outro]
One love to my nigga Suge
What's up nigga?
Sweaty ass
You know

[Audience Cheers]
