What is reality?

[Intro: Dat Nigga Daz]
Motherfuckers out here don't know shit
They ain't tryin to know shit
Just a young motherfucker out here tryin to represent
To get my motherfuckin paper
You don't think so?
Then get the fuck out my way
Cause I'm ridin on trucks, banks all that type of shit
Gotta get paid, motherfucker

[Verse 1: Dat Nigga Daz]
Fuck dreaming the same dreams
When you're down for the same team
Word it seems to be reality is just a dream
Eye to eye, the colors that I wear is do or die
When I walk down the street, will I meet evil in disguise
So, I tote a .44 with hollow tips
While my mind tellin me 'should I not?', or 'should I pull it?'
What I represent God only knows what lies for myself
Jealousy and hatred niggas is out for my wealth
Will I perish livin' selfish for the rest of my life?
Cause those who live wrong is bound to live a short life
Will money be the root of my destruction?
Without the money I can't even seem to function

[Chorus: Tha Dogg Pound]
Now there's, nowhere, for me, to turn
There's nowhere for me to hide from reality

[Verse 2: Kurupt]
As complexed as the situation gets
I remain, I maintain, ain't that much strain
To make me twist myself like Kurt Cobain (ha!)
Aw shit, I don't believe this
Some niggas that I fucked with tryin to pull a twist
But ain't that much twistin in existance
And this is how you show me love
It shows me exactly what money's capable of
Now is it the expenses, that make you wanna catch me slippin
And pay a visit? Cause this is for all my homies (all my homies)
For jackers only, come twist, to the fools in L.A. that know me
I'm back with a fifth of Henn
Kurupt and Dat Nigga Daz on the mash again

[Chorus: Tha Dogg Pound]
Now there's, nowhere, for me, to turn
There's nowhere for me to hide from reality

[Verse 3: Dat Nigga Daz]
I give it to you like it is, got no time for no games
In a world of madness, will my composure be the same?
Will my friends be around when they rest me in the ground?
I'm a lost soul, lost forever, never ever to be found
Life ain't what it seems, for the niggas full of schemes
On the hunt for the cash, they wanna blast ya for green
Hm, these sick bitches wanna get a nigga caught up
For what? A simple nut, a simple fuck

[Verse 4: Kurupt]
Daily it enhances the penitentiary chances
To survive in 1995
So I got 1995 ways to survive nowadays
Time and time again, I bust a rhyme again
Cause I'ma get in deeper shit if I convert to crime again
Out to mentally convert me, the same niggas out to hurt me
It irks me, strenuous controversy
What's next on the list to complete
After all this shit that popped off on the streets
And all eyes on me, but I won't change sides
Cause what I represent, I represent 'til I die ('til I die)
It's time for me, to grab a tall glass of (Hennessy, Hennessy)

[Verse 5: Tray Deee]
Ya see my ways is to phase all them niggas that try me
Leave em layin stiff if they ain't on IV's (beep, beep)
I beez the hardest regardless, fool
Livin life, day and night stayin hard and cruel
Keep my cool, until my mood abruptly switch
Then I'm on a niggas ass like bumpy zits (that's right)
It's no remorse when you cross my course
I'm not a hunter, but take a nigga out for sports
Don't resorts, to thinkin you could get with this
Or you will be a eulogy if you insist to diss Mis-
Ta-Tray Deee
From L.O.N.G
B.E.A.C.H., where the hardest gangstas be
Twenty-first was the worstest turf on the earth
Yet I feel I was meant to represent from birth 'til I die
You wonder why it ain't no secret
Motherfuckers best be in love with this G shit

[Outro: The Dogg Pound]
Now there's, nowhere, for me, to turn
There's nowhere for me to hide from reality
