Intro:
(inhaling) My last time gettin' high

[Verse 1: Flipside]
Fallin' in love ain't no joke
Some praise dope like the Catholic praise the pope
I'm looking at my life through the hour glass
How much longer in this world will I last?
Boostin', basin', runnin', the cops chasin'
Big time I be facin' in need of a vacation
Got caught in a year, never kicked the habit
First day on the streets still had to have it (body and soul)
Back on the scene a full fledged fiend
Pull a scheme and get high by all means
A quarter spoon a day is my medicine
I ain't never had a high that was better than
When I'm nodding, drifting in my own zone
I wanna be left all alone
Some front like they high, but they ain't high
The ultimate high is when you die

Hook:
Please tell me why, I'm hooked on this dope
It's got me feeling out of control
I can't deny (no no) that I need help
It's taking over my body and soul, body and soul

[Verse 2: Bust Stop]
Being addicted to this dope makes me wonder
Will it be another dose that'll take me under
Or another dope fiend with the same habit
Puttin' a knife in my back like a street savage
And the road that I travel is a dark route
From one stop to another then the jail house
It seems that I'm waiting on my day to pass
Methodul is what I'm on no I can't last (body and soul)
As I withdraw dripped with sweat to make it through the night
But trying to kick this freakin' habit is a strong fight
I seen my girl overdose it's been 3 days
Impuleses convulses send me in a daze
I can hear 2Pac tellin' me to be strong
But my nigga got stoned and left us out here alone
I know I gots to quit before my future unfolds
This shit got the best of my body and soul

Hook

"Picture your dreams on a triple beam"
"And it seems, don't underestimate the power of a fiend"

[Verse 3: Low M.B]
I'm lost and turned out, do anything for a fix
Dying slow and can't seem to kick the habit
Shot up so much dope I can't find a good vein
But when I ain't high my whole bodys in pain
So everyday I'm searching for that dogs food
A lost sould in the ghetto like a whirlpool
In a shack with 5 other dope fiends
Who got tracks damn near lower than a Soul Train
And it's a shame cause all it took was one hit
Straight to the vein now they got a nigga losin' it
A true hustler having money turned junky
I wanna stop but they say I can't shake the monkey
Off my back, I even tried to go cold turkey
But all it did was make me fiend more and mentally hurt me
Quickly running out of time I got to watch the clock
So I'ma die on these streets caught up in Gridlock'd

Hook (x2)
