[Devante Swing]
Yeah, I'm kickin' it for real with B Real
Come on, kick that fly gangsta shit

Blowed away, flowin' away
Chillin' like a mothafucka
On this hot ass day
Damn, kinda hot, so I just
Ride as I glide down the wicked ass south side
So, as I begin to flow, my label is Death Row
Ya know, caddy to the flow
So fire up the bud for them niggas today
Cause we be bumpin' with the groove
Gettin' blowed away

Let me take ya by the hand, let me tell ya somethin' good
There's a party goin' on, so let's ride through the hood
I don't wanna be late, don't wanna miss the fun
So hurry up and get ready
Before they roll up a fat one

1 - If you smell any smoke
It's just me and my homies gettin' blowed away
(It's all good)

Repeat 1

Now we're rollin' 3 deep in my nigga's Caddillac
And the talk is down, the sounds are bumpin' from this ghetto track
If you wanna ride, all you do is pull out the stack
And baby you can get right in, for this 20 sack

Repeat 1
Repeat 1

2 - They that there's a party tonight
There will be hoes shakin' they ass left to right
I'm havin' some fun, I got my gun
But no need for rat-tat-tat-tat
Roll a fat one

Repeat 2

And pass it around
Ohhh

Heyyy
I'm just gettin' off and it's been a long day
So I guess I'll go home and roll up a fat J
And smoke it in the tub, while I'm gettin' rubbed
Cuz a nigga like me got more hoes than a rug
Now I ain't tryna dis nobody, assist nobody
And I'm sure not the type that'll kiss anybody's ass
I lay, and say what I say
All due respects to Tim and DeVante'
For makin' a track that's fat, now it's time to get paid
So pass the J, and let's get blowed away

Repeat 2 to fade
