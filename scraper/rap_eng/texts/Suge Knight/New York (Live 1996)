[Spoken Word Intro: Snoop Dogg]
We gon' represent the East Coast for y'all
(Babay, babay)
Make some motherfuckin' noise!
Throw up the W's!
Throw up ya W's!
Sing that shit!

[Chorus]
New York, New York, big city of dreams
And everything in New York ain't always what it seems
You might get fooled if you come from out of town
But I'm down by law, and I'm from the Dogg Pound

[Verse 1: Kurupt]
It's the incredible, the lyrical
You can't be me like Niece, to see me is gonna take a miracle
I'm driving motherfuckers hysterical, with a
Touch of this twister, stylistic mixture
What I create pulsates, there is no escape
Annihilate your mental mindstate (Motherfucker)
Dre labels my vocabulary abusive
I packs more knowledge than Confucius, I'm deadly
Induce you like Medusa, with thoughts to shed
And niggas throughout this hemisphere, far and near
Prepare, catch me chillin' like the winter
Up against the number one contender, as I enter
Cause I gets heated like friction
Motherfuck your whole jurisdiction, react this fact not fiction
Telepathic addiction, to this homicidal recital
Dangerous and vital to all my rivals
Suicidal, brainwaves conveys
To the average motherfucker's minds these days
I'm all ready to put work in
Take ten steps and turn to shoot the first nigga smirkin
I don't give a fuck, what's your name, what you claim
Or why you came, motherfucker don't explain
Simply, don't tempt me, cause I'm simply
Layin hoes lifes empty, the invicible MC

[Chorus]
New York, New York, big city of dreams
And everything in New York ain't always what it seems
You might get fooled if you come from out of town
But I'm down by law, and I'm from the Dogg Pound

Too much, I serve too many people
It's too much, uh-huh-huh, huh-huh
Too much, I serve too many people
And when I finish servin' ain't gon be no sequel

New York, New York, big city of dreams
And everything in New York ain't always what it seems
You might get fooled if you come from out of town
But I'm down by law, and I'm from the Dogg Pound

Too much, I serve too many people
It's too much, uh-huh-huh, huh-huh
Too much, I serve too many people
And when I finish servin' ain't gon be no sequel

[Verse 2: Kurupt]
Gimme a couple G's, for every MC, I knocked to his knees
Verbally useless, oh you got the juice? I squeeze you juiceless
The barbaric, versatile, you're no kin to me
So how the fuck you inherit my style?
Now, out the clear blue sky, I can't deny
Not a day goes by, don't get high, don't ask why
Tonight's the night for me to rip microphones
Into bits and pieces lyrical telekinesis
Gets me into verbally vindictive
Violent vocabulary bobs to existence
Catch me in the pitch black path
I sit and let the sick thought pass through my mental
Till I hear an instrumental
And detrimental verbals get to spittin'
The highest in intellect, try connectin' with the written
Now they faced with the forbidden, vocally chosen
To explore new terrain, then remain unseen, throughout the war
Dips like a low-low, with my verbal fo'-fo'
The cocoa complexion MC with the slow flow
Fo sho', I takes it to you from the do'
Motherfucker, mentally I go hardco' (you know!)
I disconnect ya, Kurupter, MC to vocally
Bore your whole molecular, structure
Catastrophic, mystic as Mixelplix
Hittin' MC's like picks the deadliest lyricist

[Chorus]
New York, New York, big city of dreams
And everything in New York ain't always what it seems
You might get fooled if you come from out of town
But I'm down by law, and I'm from the Dogg Pound

Too much, I serve too many people
It's too much, uh-huh-huh, huh-huh
Too much, I serve too many people
And when I finish servin' ain't gon be no sequel

New York, New York, big city of dreams
And everything in New York ain't always what it seems
You might get fooled if you come from out of town
But I'm down by law, and I'm from the Dogg Pound

Too much, I serve too many people
It's too much, uh-huh-huh, huh-huh
Too much, I serve too many people
And when I finish servin' ain't gon be no sequel

[Outro]
We live baby, it was the tonight I served two thousand MC's
We live baby, cause can't none fuck with the DPG'z
We live baby, it was the night I served two thousand MC's
We live baby, none can fuck with the DPG'z
We live baby, it was the night I served two thousand MC's
We live baby, none can fuck with the DPG'z
We live baby, it was the night I served two thousand MC's
We live baby, none can fuck with the DPG'z
(What's the letters of the alphabet?)
A-B-C-D-P-G-C, baby
(Louder, louder)
A-B-C-D-P-G-C
Baby
