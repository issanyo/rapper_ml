I love the way, you work it for me
On the dancefloor
You show me things
In high places that I've never seen before
You back it up, back it up
For me all night long
We get it on, get it on, when the lights are on
And when I hold you in my arms
I got the right away, and when you tight
I shine the light, from a mile away
I opened it up and you (squirt) for hours babe
I beat it, beat it for an hour straight
I'm the man, I'm the playa from Canada
You show me skills, when you
Twerk in your purple thong
But you were different colors
When we in different places
I love the space you give me

And you are oh so fine, in "Poncho's Palace"

I love the way you shake it girl
I love the way you bake it girl
You turn me on
Get me goin and we (mess) for the night
We get it on get it on

But there is one thing that I gotta know
And sweetie, babygirl, sugar plum
Please tell me
