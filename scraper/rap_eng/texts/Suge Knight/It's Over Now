I can tell that you're worried
It's written on your face
And it tells your story
Girl, I can feel your pain

It's unspeakable what he did to you
He don't deserve one bit of you
Girl, we're walking out, it's time we're through
He might as well get over you

[Hook]
It's over now, girl, you can stop your crying
It's over now, there won't be no denying
It's over now, I promise you he won't hurt you again
You can wipe your tears away, it's over now, yes it is, oh

Well he can cry if he wants to
See that won't change a thing
'Cause, the things he did to hurt you
They'll just happen again

You can take your head and hold it up
And tell the man, you've had enough
It's time, he realize that things are through
It's time that he get over you

[Hook]

Some women don't recognize
They don't exist
They feel like that they can't survive
Without their man

It's time, we all realize it's not worth it
If you treat it so bad
Lift up your head, show somebody
Get back the respect in your life

[Hook]
