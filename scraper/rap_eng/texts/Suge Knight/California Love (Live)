[Spoken Word]
California Love, y'all!
Throw your motherfuckin' hands in the air, you know what I mean?
Keep your hand up! All of y'all stand up!
Throw your motherfuckin' hands up!
This here is the city of L.A. and we're gonna party
Get those hands up!

[Chorus]
California love
California knows how to party
California knows how to party
In the city of L.A
In the city of good ol' Watts
In the city, the city of Compton
We keep it rockin', we keep it rockin'

[Verse 1]
Out on bail, fresh out of jail, California dreamin'
Soon as I step on the scene, I'm hearin' hoochies screamin'
Fiendin' for money and alcohol, the life of a Westside player
Where cowards die and the strong ball
Only in Cali where we riot, not rally, to live and die
In L.A. we wearin' Chucks, not Ballys
Dressed in Locs and Khaki suits, and ride is what we do
Flossin' but have caution: we collide with other crews
Famous because we program
Worldwide, let them recognize from Long Beach to Rosecrans
Bumpin' and grindin' like a slow jam
It's Westside, so you know the Row won't bow down to no man
Say what you say, but give me that bomb beat from Dre
Let me serenade the streets of L.A
From Oakland to Sac-town, the Bay Area and back down
Cali is where they put their mack down, give me love!

[Chorus]
California love
California knows how to party
California knows how to party
In the city of L.A
In the city of good ol' Watts
In the city, the city of Compton
We keep it rockin', we keep it rockin'

[Bridge]
Shake, shake it, baby
Shake, shake it, mama
Shake it, shake it, Cali
Shake it, shake it, baby
Shake it, shake it, shake it, shake it
Shake, shake it, baby
Shake, shake it, mama

[Spoken Word]
The world won't be the same no more
They should've never let me on Death Row
Said it's always gonna be poppin', from '96 to 2000's
Best believe when I tell you that
We are out this bitch
I love California
And y'all better love California too
We're all representing
Fuck most of these bitch ass niggas in the mouth
When they start [?]
What the fuck is wrong with you East Side?
Let them niggas know what time it is
West Side baby! That's right New York
West Side! We are west side!

[Chorus]
California knows how to party
California knows how to party
In the city of L.A
In the city of good ol' Watts
In the city, the city of Compton
We keep it rockin'

[Bridge]
Shake, shake it, baby
Shake, shake it, mama
Shake it, Cali
Shake it, shake it, baby
Shake it, shake it, shake it, shake it
Shake, shake it, baby
Shake, shake it, mama

[Indiscernable rapping]

[Outro]
The shit don't stop, it don't stop
The shit don't stop, it don't stop
It's all BL
Turn that dawg right thought before we get started
1, 2, 1, 2, check it
