[Spoken Word: 2Pac]
Yo, y'all gotta keep this shit real
If they go bang on the West Side
We gotta go bang on them
So y’all gotta back a nigga up
Don't let 'em ban our shit
I’m ridin' for y'all
Go ahead Kad
This some new shit called "Tattoo Tears"

[Intro]
C'mon
Uh, uh
Many times
Many times

[Chorus]
I said many times busters still can't see
Y'all niggas can't fuck with me
I been, handlin stress in this shit for years
Blazed out sheddin tattooed tears (Baby)
Said many times busters still can't see
Y’all niggas can’t fuck with me
I been, handlin stress in this shit for years
Blazed out sheddin tattooed tears (Uh)

[Verse 1]
Now, Rock-a-bye baby, I'm thugged out and so crazy
Don’t want to hurt a soul nigga, so don't make me
I got a dream to see my whole team in Lexus Coupes
My enemies dead n buried, now the stress is through
But that's a dream, though it seems like reality
There'll never be peace long as there’s fiends on these Cali streets
Even on the other side brothers die, but ride
Niggas get high off a slow form of suicide
Hide the closest thoughts, the war is fought as casualties
I live my life to fuckin' mo', exposin' tragically
How can we find some peace and niggas still ain't get a piece
I know I'm probably hell-bound, but we got to eat
I'm seeing Satan infiltratin'; my military mind
Make me hustle all the time, go out for cash makin
Forgive my adversaries they don't understand what we go through
To become a man, we sheddin tattoed tears

[Chorus]
I said many times busters still can't see
Y'all niggas can't fuck with me
I been, handlin stress in this shit for years
Blazed out sheddin tattooed tears (Baby)
Said many times busters still can't see
Y'all niggas can't fuck with me (Uh-huh)
I been, handlin stress in this shit for years
Blazed out sheddin tattooed tears (Baby, baby)

[Verse 2]
Criminal ways of thinkin', I'm gettin' paid wit' Lincolns
Niggas turn made victims, get my rage from a gauge hittin'
Hittin' ya back, you ain't kickin' no facts
Fakin' jacks, you and ya bitch clique could get this AK
Hold a pound four, you catch a flame from my torch
The game was taught, I want my name in the source
Little nigga, from jumpin' GZA, Now thanks to Pizzah
I'ma tote the pistol, And slang the white coke crystal
