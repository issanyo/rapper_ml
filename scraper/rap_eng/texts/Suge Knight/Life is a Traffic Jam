[Verse 1: Eight Mile Road]
Land of the Free, and home of the enslaved
Till the concept of time
6 hours, 22 minutes, and 3 seconds, I've been standing in this
County line
By the looks of the Gridlock outside
Its gotta be about 3:39
Everybody rushin' from place to place
The looks on their faces ain't no different from mine
Both of us look like we just worked a 9-5
See, but when I clock out
I'm not looking for stress, but for the kind share
Since I started this county line shift
Huh did I say shift? I mean this sentence
I've heard nothing but sirens outside the door
How much you want to bet there's an ambulance rushin' a shot man
O.D. man, police abused black man to the hospital?
Now what they rushin' for is my interest?
Rushin' through traffic jam to get to emergency room traffic jam, that suppose to be a free clinic
Only to hear if you have or don't have insurance
It ain't nothin' but survival of the fittest
So what they rushin for?
And damn this man at the window is slow
The concept of time has us all fucked, and on top of that
Life ain't nothin' but a traffic jam

[Verse 2: 2Pac]
Life is too short, I feel trapped
Hoping I don't get caught, watch my back
Lost in the traffic, heartless and tragic
Don't wanna get my ass kicked
So I walk in this mindless state
And this, dope make me feel this way
I'll tell ya, Life is a traffic jam, I'm stuck
When will you realize you're fucked?
Don't try to change my ways, I'm hopeless
Victim to the games we play, stay focused
Watch for the crazy ride, don't lie
High till the day we die, it's my life
Tell me if you feel me, I'll tell ya
Life is a traffic jam sincerely
Stretch your mind, spoon feed your soul
3 voices you can't control
Remember life is a traffic jam
Life is a traffic jam
Life is a traffic jam
Life is a traffic jam
