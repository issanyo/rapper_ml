(Hook)
We're Grandmaster Flash!
We're giving you a blast of class! Huh!
And if you wanna know why we're on top of the pile
Cuz we got style!

(Verse 1)
Yves Saint Laurent, Pierre Cardin
The ?, the ?, and the ?
Styles not Gucci or Louis Vuitton
Imported straight from the Bronx and my name's LaVon

Creole with a few words I'd like to voice
And I ? particular choice
Got style and finesse and I'm sure you'll agree
Nobody ever never ever rhymes quite like me

(Hook)

(Verse 2)
Well my name is Broadway and games I don't play
For me the mystical, the magical but you're okay
The young man supreme I got savoir faire
And you can come into my world if you dare

Raheim the lady dream is my claim to fame
Strictly emphasizing I posses true game
Got style all around me like drapes on a wall
Responding to my slightest whim when I'm takin' a call

(Hook)

(Verse 3)
He's Larry-Love and if you have any doubt
Come try your luck and he'll take you right out
He's making the moves others never thought of
Grindin' up the floors in all the nightclubs
That want the Grandmaster Flash that everybody knows
He leaves a trail of destruction wherever he goes
Gotta style like a young jock's never seen
Don't deny you're full of envy, boy your face is turning green!
