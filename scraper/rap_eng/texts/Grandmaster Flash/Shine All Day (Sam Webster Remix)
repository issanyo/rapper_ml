(Uh Yea Uh Yea)
Yo flash let me talk to shawty right here real quick let me say this
Looking at you sometimes is hard on my eyes I get blinding
So when the sun shines on my mind and love your booty in a general way uh
When I'm around you girl I'm never tired I'm like a car's engine pissing fire
I'm always hoped up on this fire when your around me it makes a better day
Yea ominics clouds come and get dreary when your around little girl I'm never weary
Make me feel so good I get teary when I think about the love we have uh
Let me share this one thing with ya better define to clear up your picture
Your my misses and I'm your mister never kno more of the days that are sad

Where you at baby are you comin (Lay down)
So sexy I want you (Right now)
Look at how you shine (So bright now)
Come on (Shine all day)

Hey flash I think she likes me (Yes)
I wouldn't mind making her my wifey (Yes)
Maybe take her out to sight see
The South Bronx where the streets are ivory (Ivory)
I'll remind her where she came from
The same blocks that you got your name from
Well who else could you break and wa (Break and wa)
She frontin now she knows she hot (Ha ha ha)
She did her thing when she move to the A (Ayy)
That's alright I forgive her anyway (Anyway)
Cause I can only be myself with her
She don't judge who the streets perfer
They make fun when you fall in love (Fall in love)
But she the one I've been dreaming of (Dreaming of)
Plus she shyce she won't let me pop
I admit my Shawtys Hip Hop

Where you at baby are you comin (Lay down)
So sexy I want you (Right now)
Look at how you shine (So bright now)
Come on (Shine all day)

Roses are red Starbust are orange
You my two scoops topped with the almonds
You like Pop Poppa bear's bowl of porage
Way to hott to touch to taste the perfect Melody to my druming bass
Since you broke up with what's his face
I made it Ma roman numeral I
Underline it Y I'm here to protect what's in your chest's left side
I'm seeing clear skies in my forcast
I remember when we first crossed paths
I did a double take looking at you like Ahh
You keep it moving cause you didn't give Ahh
If there's 6 millon ways to die then there's 6 hundred millon ways to live
I pray forgive anything I've done that can block the sun
From you shining all day You mine all day

Where you at baby are you comin (Lay down)
So sexy I want you (Right now)
Look at how you shine (So bright now)
Come on (Shine all day)
Where you at baby are you comin (Lay down)
So sexy I want you (Right now)
Look at how you shine (So bright now)
Come on (Shine all day)
