(White lines) Vision dreams of passion
(Blowing through my mind) And all the while I think of you
(High fry) A very strange reaction
(Burns to unwind) The more I see, the more I do
Something of a phenomenon
Tell your body to come along
'Cause white lines blow away

Blow!
Rock!
Blow!

Ticket to ride the white line highway
Tell all your friends they can go my way
Pay your toll, sell your soul
Pound for pound it costs more than gold
The longer you stay, the more you pay
My white lines go a long way
Either up your nose or to your vein
Nothing to gain except killing your brain

Freeze! (Say rock come on, y'all!)
Rock! (Say freeze, come on!)
Freeze! (say rock come on, y'all!)
Rock! (say freeze, come on!)
Freeze! (say rock come on!)
Rock! (say freeze, come on!)

Rock!

Ah! (Higher baby!)
Ah! (Get higher baby!)
Ah! (Get higher baby!)
Ah! (And don't never come down!)
Freebase!

White lines (Pure as the driven snow)
Connected to my mind (And now I'm having fun, baby)
High fry (It's getting kinda low)
'Cause it makes you feel so nice (I need some one on one, baby)
Don't let it blow your mind away (Baby)
Going to a little hideaway
Cause white lines (What do white lines do!?)
Blow away

Blow!
Rock!
Blow!

A million magic crystals
Pretty pure and white
A multi-million dollars
Almost overnight
Twice as sweet as sugar
Twice as pure as salt
And if you get hooked baby
It's nobody else's fault
So don't do it!

Freeze! (Say rock come on, y'all!)
Rock! (Say freeze, come on!)

Ah! (Higher baby!)
Ah! (Get higher baby!)
Ah! (Get higher baby!)
Ah! (And don't never come down!)
Freebase!

(Don't you get too high) Don't you get too high, baby
(Turns you on) You really turn me on and on
(Could you ever come down) My temperature is rising
(When the thrill is gone) No, I don't want you to go!)

A street kid gets arrested
Gonna do some time
He got out three years from now
Just to commit more crime
A businessman is caught
With 24 kilos
He's out on bail and out of jail
And that's the way it goes

Rock!
Cane!
Sugar! (Sugar!)
Cane! (Cane!)
Sugar! (Sugar!)
Cane!

Athletes rejected
Governors corrected
Gangsters, thugs and smugglers
Are thoroughly respected
The money gets divided
The women get excited
Now I'm broke and it's no joke
It's hard as hell to fight it
Don't buy it!
