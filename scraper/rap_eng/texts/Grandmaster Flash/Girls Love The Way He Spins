(Scratch - Comomodores, Rapid Fire)

Intro - Speed is what you need if finesse is what you want to possess, of a rap about the best - Flash

Girls love the way  he spins, DJ’s try to be like him (Chorus)

Now here's a little story
That I want you to know
Back in 75 - Uh or 74
You hanging out in the streets playing silly games
Hitching on the bus
Writing on the trains

Were no cooler now than we were then
That's when the DJ craze began
Here’s a fact that is simple and plain
There was one - Grand Master Flash was his name
There was Afrika Bambaataa, Kool Herc
But Grand Master Flash was all you heard
Given the name, he earned his reputation
Sacrificed the beat
Or crowd sensation
He so fast with the tables
It's widely known
In any party situation
He can hold his own
Hands so fast got so much class
Makes all the other DJ’s a thing of the past
Now you heard the rap
And you know the score
Flash show them what your famous for


(Scratch - Release Yourself - Fantastic Aleems)

Chorus

Well right about now
I’m  gonna let you know
The man on the turntables
He’s ready to go
The wheels of steel are like his slave
The unusual way he makes them behave
And Flash is rocking em - Oh yes sir
He is moving so fast all you see is a blur
Grand Master Flash
Now hear them call
He can scratch slice dice any record at all
He uses his hands and feet
All at a different time
He’s the phonograph king does the mix so fine
Cuts with the holy ghost in his soul
His music is loved by the young and old
(???????)
His escapade
The nominated creator of the cross fade
Now if you wanna hear Flash scratch for you
Somebody say I do, I do, I do –
Well here’s Flash scratching for you
