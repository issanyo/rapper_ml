Rock, rock to Donald's groove
C'mon, clap your hands everybody
C'mon, clap your hands everybody
C'mon, clap your hands every man
C'mon, clap your hands everybody
C'mon, clap your hands
Rock, rock to Donald's groove

See it all started off when I was very young
My parents had a band, boy was big fun
Well this is the beginning of my history
Let me tell you my name, what it is Donald D

My daddy could play, my momma could sing
So naturally the kid could really swing
So I brought a drum set along with the bass
You couldn't tell me, I was an only case

So bands went out, something else came in
You had to put it on a table and make it spin
From 45's to 33's
I knew from the beginning it was just for me

One time good lookin' before we in flight
We gonna kick it, Double D style tonight
Well D is for Donald, the other's for D
Just in case you didn't know, I'm talking bout me

We got something
We got something
To make your body move
We got something
We got something
To make your body move
We got something
We got something
To make your body move
We got something
We got something
To make your body move

You heard a little something from all the rest
Like the Pillsbury, here comes the poppin' prez
Got the funky delicious, delicious the funk
So darn good it makes your [?]

Rockin' at the party ?
So you know you get your money's worth
Like Chase Manhattan, every bank is the best
You got something new, from the Donald D's ?

Before we get to it just to show you who's boss
Why don't you grab your partner while I count it off
One-two-three hit me, it's the groove! (Get into it)
So when it comes on you got to do it, turn around!
Now pick up your body and bust a move, turn around!
And don't stop rockin' til I say when

Rock, rock to Donald's groove

Once again, gonna rock the beat
Gonna make that music sound real sweet
Say who! (who?) Can it be?
Oh, it must be that Donald D

The everlastin' mind blastin'
Guaranteed for satisfaction
Comin' off, the top of the chart
Cause makin' music my form of art

Bring up, Cash Money from ?
Cause you know it's time to have a ball
Day break to the boogie shot
Like H-O-T it's got to be hot

Some like 'em heavy
Some like 'em slim
I like the ones who let me in
I'm not silky swing or [?]
But the ladies call me the candy man
I'm the M&M, peanut and plain
I'm here lookin' for my Mary Jane
I got something you should know about
My name's Donald D and my groove's laid out

Now what you see, is what it be
The brand new star of your TV
From [?] to the edge of night
Well it's Donald D, sayin' goodnight
