Step right up, Hurry, hurry, Hurry
Ladies and Gentlemen, Boys and Girls
Children of all ages
Move closer and bear witness to the one who cuts on
Not one, not two, but three turntables
Known throughout the four corners of the world as
The Fastest Man Alive

He's The Fastest Man Alive
Cut it up Flash
He's The Fastest Man Alive

Breakdown!

Born in a ghetto, lived in a slum
But he was raised high and mighty to be number one
The park was his stage, cost didn't exist
And everybody was invited to be a witness
Running things on the South Bronx streets
Known for great feats of skill and techniques
He's the priest of the beats, the king of the scratch
And all the rest are just a product of wacks!

He's The Fastest Man Alive
Cut it up Flash
He's The Fastest Man Alive

Breakdown!

Pull up your seats, class is in session
The master's gonna teach you all a good lesson
It's an open invitation despite what you've heard
And the first to come will be the first served
Perpetrated a fraud, said that you was the best
You tried to fool the public and lied to the press
You wasn't even all of that way back in the past
When you know you learned all you know from Flash!

He's The Fastest Man Alive
Cut it up Flash
He's The Fastest Man Alive

Breakdown!

Cuts are controlled by the swiftness of hand
The Turntables obey his every command
The method he uses, you say could never be bought
And only by the Grandmaster could he ever be taught
Now you gather â€˜round the stage to watch him perform
Taking notes for the next time you go on
But you can't duplicate it, so don't even try
Because the Grandmaster's hands are quicker than the eye

He's The Fastest Man Alive
Cut it up Flash
He's The Fastest Man Alive

Bus' dis

He wrote the book on the tricks that you've learnt
And the name wasn't given homeboy, was earned
He's the man called Flash, fresh from the beginning
Taking out sucker D.J's for a living
King of Hip Hop, godfather of rock
Cuts are leaving D.J's in a state of shock
You took the name Grandmaster and you made it your own
Well it belongs to Flash and you should leave it alone
Now fate's taking it's toll on the road you stole
And you can't live up to the name you hold
Grandmaster's his name you just can't take
If the people don't give it to you, you're fake
You can't hide the shame, you're every bit a disgrace
And the guilt is written all over your face
There's no doubt about it, not a question to ask
The Fastest Man Alive is Grandmaster Flash
