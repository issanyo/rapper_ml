Just get off the wall, let's have a ball
The 70's are gone, it's the 80's y'all
Grab a fly girl by the hand and ask her to dance
C'mon fellas don't be shy, just take a chance
You'll never know it might lead to romance
Cause the beat is cold stompin', it'll put you in a trance
You're so hypnotized that you stop and stare
I'm steppin out of this cuase I'm not with that there!
Get on the dancefloor c'mon take a stand
All the girlies in the place wanna dance with you my man
Get on the floor and work it out if you can
Here's my ulterior motive, I mean my game plan
It doesn't hurt to flirt, just go ahead and chase the skirt
You can't help it, it's your line of work
To get women on the floor
It's you they adore, you might as well

Chorus:
You know what time it is

Hang on party people cause here we go
We're gonna cold take the party to another plateau
But in order for us to achieve a new height
We wanna hear flash cut the beat up, ain't that right
While flash is choppin the mix like an ax on wood
You gotta dance cuase the beat is finger lickin good

Throw your hands above your head and reach for a cloud
And if there's anything you want to say, say it loud
I know the bass is pumpin' so hard the lights are dim
And y'all are lettin me know we're cold blowin the rim
That's right , you're being served, served with a smile
And homeboy you don't like it, we can step in the aisle
Just show no shame, you know it's only right
And if there's anything you want to get off, get it off tonight

Chorus

A simple puch of the fade, a little flex of the wrist
Flash whoopin the mix while I'm kickin the gift
Yo like a double edge razor, the boy is nice
When he cuts, give him room, or you might get sliced
He's too cold to hold, to hot to be stopped
This jam that we got is good to the last drop
Weather you like it or not, we rock
Yo since the day we emerged, have you heard
That it was all about a party and yo' this is word
This party's rated ns for no suckers allowed
That's the scoop, hear me troop
So don't you come here actin' wild
But as you know there's always one in the crowd
You wanna party, then act like you know, can you dig it
And if you came to get ill, forget it, I ain't with it

Chorus
