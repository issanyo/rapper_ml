[Intro]
Say, girl, what's happening, baby?
You know you're sitting on a goldmine, you need to follow me
You can make lots of money
And of course I can [?] and dress and be the funnest

[Verse 1]
Mary chose a pimp
He put her on the street
It was no accident
She was found in a hotel suite
Face down in the floor, lying in her underwear
No one even cried and no even seemed to care

[Refrain]
That Mary had a pimp
Mary had a P.I.M.P
Mary had a pimp
Mary had a P.I.M.P

[Bridge]
Mary's going crazy, girl is going out of her mind
Didn't she know the price she had to pay was high to be a hoe
And she know, she is a pimpers party
She is a pimpsky light
Now she's gone and he's still left to carry on
It's so wrong
P.I.M.P., pimp

[Interlude]
Excuse me baby, but my name is Don Wonder
And I wonder if I could buy you a drink
Cause I got something I need to run on you

[Verse 2]
Mary chose a pimp
She changed her name and moved out west
All her money went
On his wardrobe and nothing less
She even bought his house
While she lived in a motel room
Her days were spent alone with the comfort of a silver spoon

[Refrain]
Mary had a pimp
Mary had a P.I.M.P
Mary had a pimp
Mary had a P.I.M.P

[Bridge 2]
Mary's going crazy, girl is going out of her mind
Didn't she know the price she had to pay was high to be a hoe
Didn't she know?
Mary's going nuts out in the rain
Selling her body for pain
Giving all her money to some chump so he can dress funny
P.I.M.P., pimp
Mary's going crazy, girl is going out of her mind
Didn't she know the price she had to pay was high to be a hoe
Horns blow
P.I.M.P., pimp

[Verse 3: Grandmaster Flash]
You pimp, you simp, your on the street
Running your game on all the girls you meet
Fake diamonds on your fingers and Cadillac cars
Trying to catch a girl at a local bar
So you catch her and you school her and you teach her the game
Next thing you know, the girl's going insane
Now she's lost at the cost of the tricks she's turned
She's just another hoe who just been burned

[Refrain]
Mary had a pimp
Mary had a P.I.M.P
Mary had a pimp
Mary had a P.I.M.P
