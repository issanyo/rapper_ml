(feat. The Furious Five)

Come on, I said come on, I said come on

[Melle Mel]
Rappers might be willin but they ain't able
Cause I was their king straight from my cradle
I screamed and hollered and shook my rattle
And dreamt of defeating them all in battle

There was no food in my silver spoon
So I grew up hard and I grew up soon
I'm a righteous king but I'm hungry too
And I eat up chumps that rap like you

Then I met this shark and his name was Jaws
He was biting my rhymes like y'all bite yours
I starting writing my rhymes the shark grew and grew
But I was writing more rhymes than the shark could chew

The shark got sick and then he exploded
Cause he didn't realize that my rhymes was loaded
They flew in the air and into the sea
And the whole universe knew that the king was me

Come on, I said come on, I said come on

[Melle Mel]
I'm not a laser beam or a diamond mine
Or a platinum watch or some vintage wine
Not a pocket full of pearls I'm a oil well
Like black gold baby I'm Melle Mel

And to all the fly girls I come off hard
The slightest wink or nod makes me your god
All my problems are small so my pockets are large
When I walk in the door Oh baby I'm in charge

Treat ladies like jewels and diamond rings
On my fingers on my arms on everything
On the streets oh my Jesus! I can't be beat
So don't ask where's the beef baby here is the meat

I'm gonna give you some soap a towel and a cup
Cause the bum emcees are all washed up
Put your women on the line with the rest of my crew
So I can make love to her and annihilate you

Pump, pump ( me up!) me what? (me up!)

Pump, pump, pump, pump me up!

[Cowboy]
I'm like the genie in your lamp
A face on your stamp
The hip hop rocker
The microphone champ

Got a knock out voice
Like a rolls royce
Gotta rank as number one
To be the people's choice

Cause you can hum a ding then you can hum a dong
Its just like the friendly game of ping pong
When you hitting the ball upside the paddle
It's just like cowboy riding on a saddle

Up above your head is the flash of light
Cause I can rock to the beat on any God given night
Like to rock like to roll like to entertain
While my car's outside you're waiting for the train

The train to the bus the bus to whatever
And I'm the type of MC to rock in any type of weather
I'm the bow legged brother there'll never be another
I bought a mansion for my mother

Come on, I said come on, I said come on

[Scorpio]
I got a certain cool that breaks the rules
That get me paid and a lot of jewels
And the women I'm calling day and night
That's proof I'm getting mine like a thief in the night

Because Scorp is known as the singer
The quiet storm that lover didn't linger
I will not change cause its in my blood
I'm like dynamite and you a rappin dud

And if the future is here in the making
Then why I can't be part of the taking
Cause you know I like cars and fancy women
That give me good love in the beginning

Bubble bath and candle lights
And girls saying Scorp you alright?
So stop standing there like you from above
And just relax yourself and get in this tub

Pump, pump, pump, pump me up

For all you beautiful people out there
If you having a good time, everybody scream!

[Melle Mel]
I'm not a laser beam or a diamond mine
Or a platinum watch or some vintage wine
Not a pocket full of pearls I'm a oil well
Like black gold baby I'm Melle Mel

And to all the fly girls I come off hard
The slightest wink or nod makes me your god
All my problems are small so my pockets are large
When I walk in the door Oh baby I'm in charge

Treat ladies like jewels and diamond rings
On my fingers on my arms on everything
On the streets oh my Jesus! I can't be beat
So don't ask where's the beef baby here is the meat

I'm gonna give you some soap a towel and a cup
Cut the bum emcees are all washed up
Put your women on the line with the rest of my crew
So I can make love to her and annihilate you

Pump, pump ( me up!) me what? (me up!)
