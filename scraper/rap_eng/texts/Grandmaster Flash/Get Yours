Stop sleepin',ya'll,if you know what time it is
Because someone is talkin' yours as well as gettin' his
You can front and ignore,but one thing's for sure
I'm gettin' mine,so you better get yours

Get yours,go for yours
Get yours,go for yours
Get yours

Get yours everytime the opportunity knocks
And don't chill-out too hard or you'll be out of the box
Stop running your face and try to listen instead
Or you'll be known as a loud-mouth Joe Rockhead
Success is out there for everybody,take it from me
Achieve without a license or some sort of degree
And if they claim you can't do it,this is what you say
Yo follow,lead,but get out of my way

Get yours,winners never quit
Get yours,go for yours
Get yours,winners never quit
Get yours,go for yours,we went for ours

Why sit at home bummin' just a-wastin' your time
When all ya gotta do is seek an' you'll find
What you want out of life,it's there so get it
If you don't,then later you'll grow to regret it
You can ignore and think I'm talkin' out loud for my health
But don't ya do it for me,just do it for yourself
And if you need a little push,here's food for me thought
We know that you can do it,so take no shorts

Get yours,winners never quit
Get yours,go for yours
Get yours,winners never quit
Get yours,go for yours,we went for ours

For those sittin' back coolin',relaxed,gettin' fat
Waitin' for the right thing to come and drop in your lap
You see,you don't want to try,just let time fly
While your life goes by before your two eyes
You got to crawl before you walk,you see that opens the doors
Because you can't start buildin' from the sixth floor
If you work real hard,all your dreams will come true
If it happened to us,it can happen to you
The world is yours for the talkin' so what you waitin' for
You should be contemplating on how to go out and
Get yours

Get yours,winners never quit
Get yours,go for yours
Get yours,winners never quit
Get yours,go for yours,we went for ours

Get yours everybody,your ambition shows
Get on top of yours game as your confidence grows
Never take a short,give-up no slack
You can't make it with a monkey ridin' on your back
Got to get up to get down,get on over the hump
Let your feelings flow and adrenalin pump (ugh)
Stay on your guard,never take three strikes
Get everything you want but get the best out of life
Ya see,what your future holds is no mystery
When you're the one who's in control of your destiny
Just put that weak pride aside,go make it or break it
You don't need it,then leave it,someone else will sure take it
An eternal flame burns in everyone of us
Turnin' the negative things in your life to a plus
Workin' real hard beats the competition
So what you waitin' for,you don't need no permission.....

Get yours,winners never quit
Get yours,go for yours
Get yours,winners never quit
Get yours,go for yours,we went for ours

Get yours,winners never quit
Get yours,go for yours
Get yours,winners never quit
Get yours,go for yours,we went for ours
