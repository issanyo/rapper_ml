[Verse 1: ZAYN]
I close my blinds so the sun won't come in
Block out the noise but the voices within
I ain't talkin' to my friends
Sometimes they try to fool me
I know what I want
I prefer to just leave me lonely
Think I'm doin' alright
Even though they try to doubt me
Keep yourself up all night
I feel myself, I don't feel it

[Chorus: ZAYN]
You can't hide, you can't hide
You can't hide from yourself
That's all I'm sayin' baby
You can't hide, you can't hide
You can't hide from yourself
That's all I'm sayin' baby
You can't hide, you can't hide
You can't hide from yourself
That's all I'm sayin' baby
You can't hide, you can't hide
You can't hide from yourself
That's all I'm sayin' baby
You can't hide, you can't hide
You can't hide from yourself
That's all I'm sayin' baby

[Verse 2: Grandmaster Flash + Teddy Pendergrass]
Go, go, go, go, go
You can't hide
Well I just got to tell you that I
You can't hide from yourself
Everywhere you go there you are
The truth is a light, a light shining within
When you look in the mirror do you see a foe or a friend?
And (?) now
But one day you go now
Gon' break down, break down and let it all out
You can't hide from yourself
Everywhere you go there you are
I just got to say that
You can't hide from yourself
Everywhere you go there you are
Make peace with yourself before you can love another
Understand who and what you are before you can go any further
You can lie all you want now
But one got to go now
It's gon' break down, break down and let it all out
You see that
You can't hide from yourself
Everywhere you go there you are
I just got to tell you
You can't hide from yourself
Everywhere you go there you are

[Outro: Grandmaster Flash]
You can't hide, you can't hide
No matter where you go you can't hide
Might as well face the truth now
You gon' have to do it one day
I don't care
You can't hide, you can't hide
You can't hide, you can't hide
You gon' find out that's the truth some day
You can't hide, you can't hide
You can't run, you can't run
You can't go no where
