Itâ€™s like a jungle sometimes it makes me wonder how i keep from going under
It's like a jungle sometimes it makes me wonder how i keep from going under

Broken glass everywhere
People pissing on the stairs, you know they just don't care
I can't take the smell, I can't take the noise
Got no money to move out, I guess I got no choice
Rats in the front room, roaches in the back
Junkie's in the alley with a baseball bat
I tried to get away, but I couldn't get far
Cause the man with the tow-truck repossessed my car

Don't push me, cause I'm close to the edge
I'm trying not to lose my head (uh huh huh hu)
It's like a jungle sometimes, it makes me wonder
How I keep from going under
