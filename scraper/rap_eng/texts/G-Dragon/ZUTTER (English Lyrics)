TOP:
This song is sick, my rap is sick, my style is sick
I'm kinda sick
I shake my legs, I make money, I walk in the sky
Ay do you wanna

GD:
It's a mistake to call me GD, call me GOD
If you want, I'll flip it over and become DOG
Stop memorizing useless formulas but just remember this
I'm ill plus 1 (ill) Jiyongi
My age is 2 and 7 combined, natural
I never lose, the dealers get cerebral hemorrhages
Wanna be successful? Yes I'm the manual
Wanna experience me? Then keep it sexual
I left early from the School of hard knocks it's so sick
I'll sh*t on all the boring raps without consideration
Don't need to suck up my name value or my label value
Cause I get applause even when I take a sh*t
(Guess I'm famous)
This is the orientation
To welcome your unbelievable fandom
You're only all talk, saying I have too much money?
My bank account is like a pool table, so many balls

TOP:
This song is sick, my rap is sick, my style is sick
I'm kinda sick
I shake my legs, I make money, I walk in the sky
Ay do you wanna

GD:
This song is sick, my rap is sick, my style is sick
I'm kinda sick
I shake my legs, I make money, I walk in the sky
Ay do you wanna

TOP:
T.O.P, people call me a ghost
Da Vinci has come back to life, yea my brain
Your music puts me to sleep, decaffeine
You respect me? Quick get on the sinkansen
Francis Bacon in ma kitchen I'm like
Calder dancing on top of your head
All you critics who are way too serious, what do you know?
I used to be fat when I was young so
I know the taste of money

When in Rome, do as the Romans do
All you little kids, go back to your mama's arms
When you see this ground, you'll realize your reality
Little boy, hurry and go back to mama
Light radiates, it spills over
It overflows from me, I'm the one source of inspiration
Anyone can see that I'm so sick
Sick with alcohol they tell me, he's art, so sick

GD:
This song is sick, my rap is sick, my style is sick
I'm kinda sick
I shake my legs, I make money, I walk in the sky
Ay do you wanna
This song is sick, my rap is sick, my style is sick
I'm kinda sick
I shake my legs, I make money, I walk in the sky
Ay do you wanna

TOP:

G-Dra-Goni and Dagil's collaboration
Put in a bullet and bang bang bang

GD:
Tonight we're getting freaky freaky yea
Baby give me some

Tonight we're getting freaky freaky yea
Baby give me some

You and me, we're getting electric yea
Can you give me some
Give me give me some yea
