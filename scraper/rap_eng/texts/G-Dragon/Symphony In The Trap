VERSE1-You say I’m so impure
Imperfect from what I’m told
But if I cannot prove my worth
Then I’ll carve out of gold

Cause It's in my blood
To create ebb and flow
To feel your love
And to see where this can go

Step by step my journey goes
Where did the passion go

Pre-Hook-
It flew right out the window
And I ran to retrieve my own soul
But my life can't take it no more


HOOK-
The percussion that’s in my soul… Is wavering and getting low
The percussion that’s in my soul… Is wavering and getting low
The percussion that’s in my soul… Is wavering and getting low
The percussion that’s in my soul… Is wavering and getting low

CHORUS-Oh my god can you feel my tempo?
Deep in my soul I want that sforzando
Tell me why tell my why?
I don’t know I don’t know…

VERSE2-
This is my piece and I penned it
This was my grief it’s dynamic
Iced out the wrist with the patek
They say life's a comedy I am not laughing

Did you know that would happen when you cut me
Please do not talk as you see I’m conducting
I have to put on a face to get the attention now that is just something

Success? What is the use of trying hard
Playing you these sounds like a bard
No acknowledgment despite playing you my trump card


HOOK-
The percussion that’s in my soul… Is wavering and getting low
The percussion that’s in my soul… Is wavering and getting low
The percussion that’s in my soul… Is wavering and getting low
The percussion that’s in my soul… Is wavering and getting low

CHORUS-Oh my god can you feel my tempo?
Deep in my soul I want that sforzando
Tell me why tell my why?
I don’t know I don’t know…

BRIDGE-When I come together with the sound it’s a symphony
These thoughts in my mind creates the sin for me
Gotta put the pedal to the metal not to tap out
Or blackout…

HOOK-
The percussion that’s in my soul… Is wavering and getting low
The percussion that’s in my soul… Is wavering and getting low
The percussion that’s in my soul… Is wavering and getting low
The percussion that’s in my soul… Is wavering and getting low

CHORUS-Oh my god can you feel my tempo?
Deep in my soul I want that sforzando
Tell me why tell my why?
I don’t know I don’t know…
