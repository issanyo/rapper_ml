Korean Original

[Intro: G-Dragon]
It's all about you, my butterfly

[Chorus: Jin Jung & G-Dragon]
Every time I come close to you
Every time I'm feeling you
Feels like I'm gonna dream every time
I get butterflies

[Verse 1: G-Dragon]
무심코 하늘을 봐 Like
네 웃는 모습을 닮아
유난히 눈부신 걸 ooh Baby
내 하룻속 넌 아마 로맨틱한 drama
날 울고 웃게 하죠 no no no

[Verse 2: G-Dragon]
잠들지 못하겠는데 (네 이름을 불러보는데)
난 수줍은 듯 고개를 돌리고 (no matter what)
이렇게 좋아하는데
좀처럼 걸음마를 뗄수가 없어
(Don't know how much I love you)

[Chorus: Jin Jung & G-Dragon]
Every time I come close to you
Every time I'm kissing you
Feels like I'm gonna dream every time
I get butterflies

[Bridge: G-Dragon]
Beautiful girl

[Verse 3: G-Dragon]
무심코 땅을 봐 Like
너의 이름 세글자 너무나 설레는 걸 ooh Baby
네 작은 상처 하나 내가 아물게 해줄게
나의 사랑 그대 (everytime)

[Verse 4: G-Dragon]
Yo 넌 마치 나비처럼
꽃 찾아 날아다니는 저 아이처럼
순수한 눈망울을 머금고 (no matter what)
하늘하늘 거리는 몸짓
아른아른한 니 눈빛 나 어떻게 됐나봐
(You're the only one girl, one love, one life, yeah)

[Chorus: Jin Jung & G-Dragon]
Every time I come close to you
Every time I'm holding you
Feels like I'm gonna dream every time
I get butterflies

[Verse 4: G-Dragon]
내가 약속한게 야속하게
어긋나더라 속타게
Just another days 다 똑같애
뭐 이렇게 복잡해
넌 남자를 못 믿는데
사랑도 영원할 수 있는데
밀고 당기는건 왜 하는데
좀 더 솔직 하게 굴 순 없는데

[Verse 5: G-Dragon]
내 눈을 봐
Look at my eyes
You see my eyes
You see my lips
Listen to my heart
들린다면 답해줘
내 볼에 Kiss & Hug
Natural high
My memories
Yes my heart
Yes that'll be all I say
너와 내 설레임만 가득하다면은
우린 never ever no break up, trust me
I'll make love to you

[Chorus: Jin Jung & G-Dragon]
Every time I come close to you
Every time I'm feeling you
Feels like I'm gonna dream every time
I get butterflies

[Outro: G-Dragon]
Yeah, you're special to me
Your turn
La la la la la la la
Yeah my butterfly

[Verse 1: G-Dragon]
Check it
Unintentionally, I look at the sky like
It reminds me of you when you smile
Namely, how dazzling it is, ooh baby
My day consists of our romantic drama
It makes me laugh and smile, no no no

[Verse 2: G-Dragon]
I can't sleep (I try calling your name)
I turn my head shyly (no matter what)
I like it this much
I rarely stop walking
(Don't know how much I love you)

Beautiful girl

[Verse 3: G-Dragon]
Unintentionally, I look at the ground like
My heart flutters at your 3-letter name, ooh baby
I'll heal every single one of your small wounds
My love is you (every time)

[Verse 4: G-Dragon]
Yo, like a butterfly
You look for a flower, flutter around like a child
Your innocent eyes have a smile
Your body moves like the sky, the sky
Your eyes glimmer, glimmer
I've become like this
(You're the only one girl, one love, one life, yeah)

[Chorus: Jin Jung & G-Dragon]
Every time I come close to you
Every time I'm holding you
Feels like I'm gonna dream every time

[Verse 4: G-Dragon]
To promise what I promised
We missed each other, and it makes me worry
Just another day, it's all the same
What, why is this all so complicated
Though you can't trust guys
Love can be forever
Why do you push and pull
Can't you be a bit more honest

[Verse 5: G-Dragon]
Look at my eyes
You see my eyes
You see my lips
Listen to my heart
If you're listening answer me
Kiss me on the cheek
Natural high
My memories
Yes my heart
Yes that'll be all I say
If our love continues to fill us up
Then we'll never ever break up, trust me
I'll make love to you

[Chorus: Jin Jung & G-Dragon]
Every time I come close to you
Every time I'm feeling you
Feels like I'm gonna dream every time
I get butterflies

Yeah, you're special to me
Your turn
La la la la la la la
Yeah my butterfly
