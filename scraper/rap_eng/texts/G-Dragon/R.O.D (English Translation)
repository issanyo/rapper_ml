You are my pleasure
I feel like a little kid
Trying not to think about you
Only 10 minutes at the longest
Our relationship right now is between cold and hot
Anything is fine
If I could keep you right beside me
Your face is so beautiful like a sculpture
When I look at you I freeze like a statue
my superstar
You’re one butterfly
Butterfly effect in the flower garden
In your little smile
There’s a big storm in my heart
Keep running away
Fly away
At this moment, know more about me
Guys are either kids or dogs
Other guys will take you away like a hawk
I’ll give you the love you’ve never felt before
I’ll be ya james bond, Until the end for you

You got me losing my mind
The way you got me fired up
Never give up boy even when they try us
You and me against the world
With you I ride or die tonight

You have my heart like the beat
The way you got me turned up
Never give up boy even when they try us
You and me against the world
With you I ride or die tonight

If I’m a boring realist
You’re a dreamer
If you’re going there
I’ll follow you even if I’m dreaming
On that green field
Let’s build a picturesque house
On your ring finger
Let’s get a diamond as big as your thumb
I’ll give you the world
You can be the owner
This is a crazy love song
You can just be the main character
My calendar is red, why?
cuz everyday is your birthday
My calendar is red, why?
cuz everyday is your birthday
Listen well
Come here
Please stop lifting me up and letting me go
You might say two different things with one mouth
Let’s stop with the childish playing nah
We ride or die
You’re bonnie
I’m clyde
There’s no tomorrow for us tonight

You got me losing my mind
The way you got me fired up
Never give up boy even when they try us
You and me against the world
With you I ride or die tonight

You have my heart like the beat
The way you got me turned up
Never give up boy even when they try us
You and me against the world
With you I ride or die tonight

Me and my girl friend we ride or die
Me and my girl friend
Me and my girl friend we ride or die
Me and my girl friend

Me and my girl friend we ride or die
Me and my girl friend
Me and my girl friend we ride or die
Me and my girl friend

You got me losing my mind
The way you got me fired up
Never give up boy even when they try us
You and me against the world
With you I ride or die tonight

You have my heart like the beat
The way you got me turned up
Never give up boy even when they try us
You and me against the world
With you I ride or die tonight
