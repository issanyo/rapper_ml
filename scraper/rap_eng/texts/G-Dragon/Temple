[Intro: Spoken]
As you move towards the center, you see an open temple
A presence patiently waits for you
And as you walk toward the inward glade
You can see her pale, calm, luminous face

[Intro: M.I.A.]
Warriors, go! Get your freak on
You don't need money 'cause you won't be alone
Go! I'll get you in the zone
You don't need money 'cause you won't be alone

[Verse 1: M.I.A.]
Got my lookout, girls got fit boys to look at
Tiger's room, what the fuck you looking shook at?
Fuck it! Touch it good! Flick it! Lick it!
When you come here you wanna get stuck in
Empty your pockets, phone out your jacket
The title on my land is louder than the racket
In my jungle, don't stumble in my symbol

[Hook: M.I.A. & G-Dragon]
Body, body, body, body, body, body, body, bow
Everybody heard about me, everybody know
Faster than a hunter with an arrow to the bow
If he steps close then I'm gonna let it go

[Verse 2: G-Dragon]
빵야 빵야 빵야
샤바 샤바 아이샤바 평화 빼기 하나
사바세계 모두 나와 극락 가자 (alright)
가나다라마바사아자차카타파하
삶에 눈뜨자, 아, 현실 타파, 하
Yeah hanging in my A and I aim for your temple
Shoot up your party on the beat to the tempo
Bad girls, with the good boy 찹쌀떡

[Pre-Hook: G-Dragon]
Body, body, body, body, body, body, body, bow
Everybody heard about me, e'erybody know
Faster than a hunter with an arrow to the bow
If he steps close then I'm gonna let it go

[Hook: M.I.A. & G-Dragon]
Body, body, body, body, body, body, body, bow
Everybody heard about me, everybody know
Faster than a hunter with an arrow to the bow
If he steps close then I'm gonna let it go

[Verse 3: M.I.A.]
My bed is like a lotus and I wake up on it, blessed
Start the day wake up on a belly-belly flex
Every girl together, we can still do it best
People with the money what they do more or less
Focus on the grind and I'm best by default
Step into my temple and you see me on my throne
Gold on the dome, don't drop that drone
If you don't like it then I'm gonna change the tone

[Hook: M.I.A. & G-Dragon]
Body, body, body, body, body, body, body, bow
Everybody heard about me, everybody know
Faster than a hunter with an arrow to the bow
If he steps close then I'm gonna let it go
