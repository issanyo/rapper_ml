[Hook]
Put your hands up like the
Country’s been liberated
Run like you’ll twist your ankles
Shake it like you have a spasm
Everyone sing along

[Verse 1]
My name is T to the A to the E (to the)
Y to the A N G (hot, it’s hot)
I’m always hotly burning up (boiling)
Girls cry over my body, my songs
Whether it’s a slow jam or a dance
Just trust your body
Don’t be scared, just close your eyes
Wanna get high? Then be my pair
We’ll go on a roller coaster ride tonight
There’s no seat belt
You just need to sit next to me

[Pre-Hook]
Don’t stop baby don’t kill my vibe
Because I like how things are going right now
To the left, to the right, follow me
Just like that Yeah ah ye ye yeah

[Hook]
Put your hands up like the
Country’s been liberated
Run like you’ll twist your ankles
Shake it like you have a spasm
Everyone sing along
Ringa linga ring ringa linga ring (like)
Ringa linga ring ringa linga ring (like)
Ringa linga ring ringa linga ring
Ringa linga (ahssa) ringa linga (it’s good)

[Verse 2]
It’s a fiery Friday night
So be careful of the burn
The crowd looks good so don’t worry
And keep your body movin
We partying so hard like it’ll break
Monday is so far
Like it’ll never come again
Forget everything of yesterday
Just like how you did with the day before
Erase everything of tomorrow
Just like it’s someone else’s business
Everyone jump jump jump
As if you’re playing jump rope
Ladies bump bump bump
Shake shake that thing for me

[Pre-Hook]
Don’t stop baby don’t kill my vibe
Because I like how things are going right now
To the left, to the right, follow me
Just like that Yeah ah ye ye yeah

[Hook]
Put your hands up like the
Country’s been liberated
Run like you’ll twist your ankles
Shake it like you have a spasm
Everyone sing along
Ringa linga ring ringa linga ring (like)
Ringa linga ring ringa linga ring (like)
Ringa linga ring ringa linga ring
Ringa linga ringa linga

[Bridge]
It’s our party we can
Do what we want to
Step to this rhythm, everyone 1, 2
1, 2, 3 baby 1, 2 step
Ye ye ye ye ye ye ye Don’t let go
Of my hands, don’t run boo
I’ll give you the whole world
Hey DJ, turn up the volume now

[Hook]
Put your hands up like the
Country’s been liberated
Run like you’ll twist your ankles
Shake it like you have a spasm
Everyone sing along
Ringa linga ring ringa linga ring (like)
Ringa linga ring ringa linga ring (like)
