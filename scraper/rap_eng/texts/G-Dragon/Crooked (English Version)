[Chorus]
Nothing ever lasts forever
In the end, you changed
There is no reason, no sincerity
Take away such a thing as love
Tonight I'll be crooked
Leave me alone
I was alone anyway
I have no one, everything is meaningless
Take away the sugar-coated comfort
Tonight I'll be crooked

[Verse 1]
I scream and get dizzy
I vent out of boredom
To other couples
I start fights for no reason
Like a town gangster
Sometimes, I purposely
Shake my leg, crookedly

[Verse 2]
The main characters of the movie
Called this world is you and me
A lonely island, lost and wandering
The empty streets are
Filled with those who are alone
Unlike my heart
The weather is so damn nice

[Pre-Chorus]
I used to believe in you alone
And I was happy
But like a joke, I am left alone
You used to promise me
With your pinky finger
But in the end

[Chorus]
Nothing ever lasts forever
In the end, you changed
There is no reason, no sincerity
Take away such a thing as love
Tonight I'll be crooked
Leave me alone
I was alone anyway
I have no one, everything is meaningless
Take away the sugar-coated comfort
Tonight I'll be crooked

[Verse 3]
I’ll put on thick eyeliner
Use a whole can of hairspray
Leather pants, leather jacket with a frown
I want to hide my pain
And become even more crooked
So you can feel sorry
I’ll spit toward the sky

[Verse 4]
You’re scared of my crude words and rough eyes
But actually, I’m afraid
I want to go back but
I have nowhere to go
I want to love but no one to love
What am I supposed to do?
I can’t turn it back

[Pre-Chorus]
I used to believe in you alone
And I was happy
But like a joke, I am left alone
You used to promise me
With your pinky finger
But in the end

[Chorus]
Nothing ever lasts forever
In the end, you changed
There is no reason, no sincerity
Take away such a thing as love
Tonight, I’ll be crooked
Leave me alone
I was alone anyway
I have no one, everything is meaningless
Take away the sugar-coated comfort
Tonight I'll be crooked

[Outro]
Will you not say anything
For me tonight?
I didn’t know being alone would
Be this hard (I miss you)
Will you be my friend tonight?
On this good day
This beautiful day
This day where I miss you
Tonight I'll be crooked
