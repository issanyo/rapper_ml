[Verse 1: G-Dragon]
When I appear on the television (Wassup)
Even if I’m dead beat I won’t show it
Different swagger from the top to toe
This is my style I depend on much
(Today) Because of the pretties lined up today (Wassup)
All looking only at me, what’s love
Stop and do not fight, come come slowly right now
And damn, because of this I have become tired

[Verse 2: G-Dragon]
Too fast to live, Too young to die
My body is small but my voice is Gulliver
My age is young but inside is Sullivan
The warrior has returned once again
My name is G G G G baby baby
GD GD baby baby
You want fame? Playin’ your stupid little game
You should check your girl’s phone
That’s my face in the frame

[Verse 3: Teddy]
Now anybody wanna know
That the boy name Teddy, what he up to
The rhythm in my head is already on your shelf
My ten fingers are on the keyboard today
Yeah, it’s checkmate after they were produced
Yo, so deep ho, and dive in
A submarine is fast but an airplane’s faster
Airplanes fly, and so has Teddy

[Verse 4: Teddy]
GD be the ace; CL, she a queen
Have 2NE1, they black jack, beat that
Big Bang in your face pow; now take that
We the leaders of the new school, how you love that
Footsteps upright, my future’s clear and bright
Even though I wish to win, it’s a dangerous fantasy
Let you have a tour around in advance
Keep looking at my feet, my shoes are Lanvin

[Verse 5: CL]
We, we, we da, we da leaders
You ain’t in the game
You’re just cheerleaders
My age is nineteen, vision is HD
I have good brains with a natural style
I was already cool, now I’m even cooler
I’ve burnt the stage a several times
‘Cos I’m hot, always the best
And this number 1 spot
Is my home sweet home

[Verse 6: CL]
If you’re going to do it, then don’t ever follow me
See if you can do it naturally
I just do what I wanna
I’ve always knew how to keep it together lady-like
But I’m flipping and freaking it, for it’s not a habit
Ready or not here I come
We don’t Care eh eh eh
Who is that person in front
Don’t hesitate and just leave now, please
And I’m CL the one and only baddest female

[Hook: Teddy & CL]
