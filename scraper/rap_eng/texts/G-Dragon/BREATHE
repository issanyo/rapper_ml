I can't breathe
I can't breathe
I can't breathe (no more) yeah

I can't breathe no more
I can't sleep no more
어지러운 세상에 차가운 도심속에 나 홀로

I can't live no more but
I can't stop no more
눈을 감아도 이젠 들리지 않는 너의 그 숨결

I can't deny 고요히 잠든밤
그 속에 나타난 넌 너무나 아름다워

Hey gorgeous sweet amazing baby
I know you want it baby
이시간만큼은 You and me hardcore
'Till you say no more

I can't breathe
I can't breathe
나를 조여오는 느낌이 싫지 않아

I can't breathe
I can't breathe
아침이 밝아와도 난 깨고 싶지않아
I can't breathe

상상은 질렸어
난 절제를 잃었어
모순된 상황 변함없는 건
넌 나의 V-V-Venus
달나라 건너 별 다음엔 해 저물어
지금 이 순간만을 기다려 온 걸 I wonder

I can't deny 고요히 잠든밤
그 속에 나타나는 너무나 아름다워
(Come on and do it and screw it baby)
I know you want it baby
이시간만큼은 You and me hardcore

Translation

I can’t breathe
I can’t breathe
I can’t breathe

I can’t breathe no more
I can’t sleep no more
In this crazy world, the cold heart of the city, I’m alone
I can’t live no more but I can’t stop no more
Even if I close my eyes I can’t hear your breathing anymore

I can’t deny, a night I quietly sleep
You appear in me you’re so beautiful
Hey gorgeous sweet amazing baby
I know you want it baby
You and me hardcore right now
Til you say no more

I can’t breathe I can’t breathe
I don’t even care for the feeling like I’m being squeezed
I can’t breathe I can’t breathe
Even when the morning’s bright, I don’t want to get up
I can’t breathe

I’m tired of imagination, I lost my self restraint
Situation turned contradictory, You are my unchanged V V Venus!
If you take the stars from the other side of the moon, the sun will grow dark
I’ve been waiting for this moment I wonder

I can’t deny, a night I quietly sleep
You appear in me
You’re so beautiful
Hey gorgeous sweet amazing baby
I know you want it baby
You and me hardcore right now
Let’s do it some more

I can’t breathe I can’t breathe
I don’t even care for the feeling like I’m being squeezed
I can’t breathe I can’t breathe
Even when the morning’s bright, I don’t want to get up
I can’t breathe

I can’t breathe I can’t breathe
I don’t even care for the feeling like I’m being squeezed
I can’t breathe I can’t breathe
Even when the morning’s bright, I don’t want to get up
I can’t breathe

The magnificent morning came through the curtains
Your outstretched hand that calls me
Secretly come to my bed
Quietly, so no one knows

I can’t breathe I can’t breathe
I don’t even care for the feeling like I’m being squeezed
I can’t breathe I can’t breathe
Even when the morning’s bright, I don’t want to get up
I can’t breathe

I can’t breathe I can’t breathe
I don’t even care for the feeling like I’m being squeezed
I can’t breathe I can’t breathe
Even when the morning’s bright, I don’t want to get up
I can’t breathe

No no no I can’t breathe
I can’t breathe breathe breathe no more
I can’t breathe I can’t breathe no more
I - CAN’T - BREATHE
