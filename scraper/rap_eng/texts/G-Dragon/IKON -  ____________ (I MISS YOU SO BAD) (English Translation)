I hope this wouldn’t be
The last song that I sing for you
I hope this wouldn’t be
The last letter that I write for you
I hope this wouldn’t be
The last time that I’m going to you
I pray
Please say it’s not
I hope this would be
The last time to see me crying because of you
I hope this would be
The last night that I miss you
I hope I could be
Myself without you

No No
No No
I miss you so bad

I was crazy
You were so beautiful
Your hand is
Going too far to hold
Can I go back?
I always
Kneel down
Under the moon every night
Please don’t say
This is the end
If you still love me
Please don’t leave me
I will try to
Glue the a broken bowl
I will try to
Gather the split water

You are forgetting me
One by one
So I’m going crazy
I’m tired
How many days
Should I pray more
How many glasses
Should I drink more

I was really scared to let you go
So I called you
You blocked me
Silence. And I lock myself in despair
Because I know it’s my fault
You should be happy

I hope this wouldn’t be
The last song that I sing for you
I hope this wouldn’t be
The last letter that I write for you
I hope this wouldn’t be
The last time that I’m going to you
I pray
Please say it’s not

I hope this would be
The last time to see me crying because of you
I hope this would be
The last night that I miss you
I hope I could be
Myself without you

No No
No No
I miss you so bad

When you touched me
It was so warm
My memory is worn out
I can’t remember when you kissed me

If I think of you for a short moment
I cry eventually
Woo Woo

Real talk baby
Let’s go
My obsession is too bright
So close your eyes
I hold you from the behind even though
I know you wouldn’t see me
It was what I wanted
But now it remains as a regret
You came like a wind
But please don’t leave any scent
Just like a couple of leaves
On the swamp
You don’t have to pick me up
Because I’m worthless
If wind blows
My heart is empty
I can’t feel anything but you
What remains is the feeling that’s left

I understand you
I was the one who was okay
When I look back
I cry
I’m sorry you gotta move on
In the distant future
I hope we could be friends

I hope this wouldn’t be
The last song that I sing for you
I hope this wouldn’t be
The last letter that I write for you
I hope this wouldn’t be
The last time that I’m going to you
I pray
Please say it’s not

I hope this would be
The last time to see me crying because of you
I hope this would be
The last night that I miss you
I hope I could be
Myself without you

No No
No No
I miss you so bad
