Let's go
You ain't got a girl right now (no)
Well, 'cause you ain't got no game (I know)
Imma show you how to do it real quick
GD style (you should write it down)
Here's some rules though
One, put on somethin' nice
Two, don't be nervous
Three, just be yourself (yeah)
Follow me now

You just wanna be rap star
삐딱한 모자 살짝 걸쳐주고 바진 힘껏 내려주고
하얀 운동화 빛나는 목걸이 (bling)
걸을 때도 꼭 리듬에 맞춰
표정또한 개구지게 인상써
왼손엔 mic 오른손엔 boombox
입이 심심하다면 북치기 박치기

Yeah, you're nice & cool
이제 저기 hip girl에게 nice to meet you (hi, what's up?)
그런 인사법은 비추
이상하게 쳐다 보잖아 man, I told you (oh, no!)
눈치는 다 밥말아먹었어
잘나가다가 다 말아먹었어
But 기횐 다시 돌아오는 법
So hollaback, yo

Hello 섹시가이도 hello 핸섬보이도
Hello, hello 먼저 말걸어준다면
Hello 도도한걸 hello 귀여운걸
Hello, hello 저기 잠시만요 say hello

So you wanna be like model
이번엔 좀 어려운데 일단은
가만히 있어도 화보를 찍어야 되고
조금은 시크하게 센치하게 때로는
그냥 청바지에 흰티 깔끔한 Suit 아니면 빈티지
런웨이를 걷듯 멋스럽게 김치
인생이 show like James Dean

Yeah, you're nice & cool
You can do it too
You don't see that? fool
그녀도 널 보네 힐끗 힐끗

여자의 자존심은 높은 하이힐 끝
네가 먼저 다가가 조심스레
눈은 지긋이 그건 게슴츠레 해
차나 마시고 재밌는 영화도
Say, Ill go any where you go

Hello 섹시가이도 hello 핸섬보이도
Hello, hello 먼저 말걸어준다면
Hello 도도한걸 hello 귀여운걸
Hello, hello 저기 잠시만요 say hello

잠깐 실례합니다 (나도 잠깐 실례합니다)
나쁜 사람은 아냐 (표현이 서툴뿐인 걸)
용기 내 여기까지 왔으니 don't say goodbye
그댈 처음본 순간 I'm fallin' in love with you girl

Hello 섹시가이도 hello 핸섬보이도
Hello, hello 먼저 말걸어준다면
Hello 도도한걸 hello 귀여운걸
Hello, hello 저기 잠시만요 say hello

Translation

Let's go you ain't got a girl right now
Well cuz you ain`t got no gain (I know)
I'm show you how to do it gd style (you should write it down)
Here's some rules though
One, put on something nice
Two, don't be nervous
Three, just be yourself (yup) Follow me now

He just wanna be rap star big time?
Put your hat lightly on your head
And pull your pants down as hard as you can
White shoes and shining necklace (bling!)
When you walk follow the rhythm too
And have a tough expression
Mic in left hand, boombox in right, if you're bored beatbox

Yeah cute nice and cool
Now say nice to meet you to that hip girl
But she's looking at you weird
With your way man I told you (oh no)
It's sense-able, dven though you did well, you can still tell
But a way to get another chance so hollaback yo

Hello sexy guy or hello handsome boy
Hello Hello I'll talk to you first
Hello powerful girl hello cute girl
Hello hello uh, excuse me, say hello

She's wanna be, now kind of a hard date
Even if you sit still you have to take a picture
A little bit more chic, more sentimental (fashion)
Jeans and a white tee, fresh suit or maybe vintage
Whatever you wear, wear it with charm (kimchi)
Like you've worn it your whole life show like

Yeah cute nice and cool, you can do it too
You don't see that fool
That girl's looking at you too, she's catching a glimpse
A girl's pride is her high heels height
You go first carefully
Your eyes are sleepy, drink something
Even a fun movie, say I go anywhere you go

Hello sexy guy or hello handsome boy
Hello Hello I'll talk to you first
Hello powerful girl hello cute girl
Hello hello uh, excuse me, say hello

Excuse me
Me too, excuse me
I'm not a bad person
The expression was probably just unpracticed
You're brave to come all the way to me, don't need to say goodbye
When I first saw you I'm falling in love with you girl

Hello sexy guy or hello handsome boy
Hello Hello I'll talk to you first
Hello powerful girl hello cute girl
Hello hello uh, excuse me, say hello

La la la la la la La la la la la la La la la la la la

Hello sexy guy or hello handsome boy
