Even when everyone said you are a bad boy
I liked you for being real
It felt right
But they were right

From the moment we first met
I got used to your indifference
And it’s so wrong
It’s been so long

Can you feel the heart pounding feeling that you longed for
From the girl who is in your eyes right now?

That beautiful girl
Won’t have any tears for you
She won’t even wait for you like this

Why do good girls like bad boys?
Why do bad boys like bad girls?

That’s why I love you
But why don’t you know my heart?

Cuz I’m so good to you yeah
You love her but her kiss is a lie
Cuz I’m so good to you yeah
You kiss her but your love is a lie

Cuz I’m so good to you yeah
You love her but her kiss is a lie
Cuz I’m so good to you yeah

Can you say the words from when you first confessed to me
To her, who is smiling in front of you right now?

The girl who has you
Won’t have any foolish tears
She won’t even have this longing for you

Why do good girls like bad boys?
Why do bad boys like bad girls?

That’s why I love you
But why don’t you know my heart?

Cuz I’m so good to you yeah
You love her but her kiss is a lie
Cuz I’m so good to you yeah
You kiss her but your love is a lie

Cuz I’m so good to you yeah
You love her but her kiss is a lie
Cuz I’m so good to you yeah

I believed it when you said you loved me
I wanted to believe that you were different from other guys
Like a fool, I gave you my heart
Because of you I’m
Locked in a deep sadness
Swallowing my tears alone
Did it have to be me?
Why did you do that?
Was it a sin to love you?
Why am I the only one hurting?

You sweetly melted me
You lightly deceived me
You hotly drenched me
You coldly left me

Cuz I was good to you
I just can’t cut you out
Maybe I was too good for you
It’s no use being good
