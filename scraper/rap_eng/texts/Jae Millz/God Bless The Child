[Intro:]
Father Millzie aka Millzie Wallhall
I'm the God and I'm one hell of a artist

[Verse 1:]
I know where I'm from so I know where I'm going
I'm from where chains be glowing and niggas girls be hoein'
A lot of promises broken, no time for roastin'
This little niggas will smoke you
Get some dimes and smoke 'em
I be high off potent, tryna survive, just hopin
These haters don't JFK me in my ride while I'm floating
Got a beautiful daughter, she just entered the world
Cal me a sucker for love, do anything for that girl
I don't worry bout hate, I don't worry bout love
If everybody befriend me still got the man up above
If you move in them pitchets, get your chick in there dog
Cause the gov taking pictures when you out in the club
Better believe it
My ex told me grow up
The she told me I changed, I said I ain't who I was
She TB'in my cup, redbonin my ride
And I've been ready to fly since ready to die

[Hook:]
Straight from the bottom, straight to the top where I'm goin
I could still be in motion when my car roof open
Lord, yo yo
God bless the child
I've been killin for a while and ya'll bless my style
Amen
God bless the child
She ain't have a lot of school but God bless the now
God bless the child
God bless the child
God bless the child

[Verse 2:]
I know where I'm from so I know where I'm going
I'm a uptown nigga, all my jewelry is golden
All my homeys are solid, all my women exotic
All my relatives seated, I chose rap over college
I curved NYU, went straight to the lead
Fuck orientation, I got paper to see
I got places to be, I got people to meet
Never wanted to be like Mike, wanted to be RP
That's Rich Porter
I'm so Harlem, so Harlem
Way gone and weight money, no problem, no problem
I do this for the G's, lot starving for a pardon
Cause it get cold in them jail cells when them lights darken
Better believe it
We ain't getting no younger
Got a kid my nig, gotta eliminate hunger
Gotta stay on this money, I gotta stay sucka free
Both palms together, Lord bless me please

[Hook:]
Straight from the bottom, straight to the top where I'm goin
I could still be in motion when my car roof open
Lord, yo yo
God bless the child
I've been killin for a while and ya'll bless my style
Amen
God bless the child
She ain't have a lot of school but God bless the now
God bless the child
God bless the child
God bless the child
