Fuck a nigga bitch, yeah I’m so ignorant
Fifty deep with my clique, yeah I’m so ignorant
These niggas know what’s up ‘cause I’m so ignorant
I’m chasing that money, a nigga don’t give a shit
I’m ignorant, I’m ignorant, yeah I’m so ignorant
I’m ignorant, I’m ignorant, yeah I’m so ignorant
Fuck a nigga bitch ‘cause I’m so ignorant
The money getting to her, I just don’t give a shit

[Vese 1: Makarel]
Yesterday hit a lick
I [?] give him shit, yeah I’m so ignorant
I hustle so different
Pounds I be flippin’ and I’ll need my dividends
I’m about Benjamins
She suck my dick, she say I taste like cinnamon
I be with many [?]
Cuff you in Timberlands, fuck all the Zimmermans
I’m flying through the city like a ghost
When I’m in the club yeah I do the most
Don’t play me close ‘cause I got the toast’
If he ain’t ignorant, I am no friend of him
Fuck her and kick her out I am no gentleman
My swag is sizzling

[Verse 2: Jae Millz]
Keep it professional
Don’t hit my number if it ain’t numerical
You put her on a pedestal
I fucked in her living room came on her sectional
Her pussy incredible
She [?] your calls and your texts leave you skeptical
No G5 I be jettin’ through
Candy red Ferrari that bitch looking edible
And snitch what we never do
Under no circumstances snitch what we never do
Floating like David Heston do
On that molly, that Henny and probably a L or two
Stay in your lane what you better do
Your money is funny bet you count hysterical
All of my niggas smoke medical
Ten chains on my neck, Mr. T in the flesh
I’m too gone

[Verse 3: T-Shyne]
Who that ignorant nigga that be rolling in the Jeep
Four deep, with some niggas that be carrying the heat
Bad Boy swear to God I’m Mike Lowrey on the beat
Catch a body now it’s looking like a rally in the streets
Trying to make a flip real quick
Gotta move seven pounds like my name Will Smith
Last night caught a lick
And my wrist will flick if I need me some chips
I’m just trying to maintain
Nigga we ain’t on the same plane
Y’all niggas still talking bout the same thang
Tell that bitch she ain’t even gang till we gang bang
Niggas wanna claim that they chain hang
I don’t get a chain till that bitch is full of bling blang
And a nigga crack heads like bling blang
Rolling up the Mary
