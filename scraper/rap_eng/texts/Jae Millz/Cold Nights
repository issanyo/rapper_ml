[Verse 1:]
Cold nights trying to make a dollar
Her boyfriend's fist just made her holla
Shawty studying to be a scholar
But he keep losing focus from the sound of that blocker
I pray this old lady don't call the copers
Like she a crime stopper fucking peep hole watcher
Mama know the way I'm living siri
Bundles in my pocket like I'm carrying stacks obituary
Rest is peace to my slime
Forever one of the doppest of his time
See real niggas do real things, BIG said that
So I live by that 'cause BIG said that
I'm from a place where young niggas don't praise the Lord
They praise the nigga who bust his chopper and move raw
Sound fucked up but his life though
And I don't know you what you talking about the price for

[Hook:]
Cold nights cold as stair cases
Going hard where I'm from that's just a clear basics
Cold nights cold as stair cases
I don't know which is worse the snitch of the statement
Cold nights cold as stair cases
Cold nights cold as stair cases
Going hard where I'm from that's just a clear basics

[Verse 2:]
Pray for me 'cause I ain't trying to get court
Only thing I hate more than her period is going to court
Nigga, we grind out till the work done
And that grind going over time till when the first come
Dutch guts on the steps five blunts in rotation
Who is go to next
Typical hood shit
She like what you smoking on I'm like that good shit
Every hussler in my world pray for a good flip
Wake up hit the bank bust a check with a good lick
They say tomorrow ain't promise so I'm on it today
My daughter gotta eat, fuck what you have to say
Cold nights cold as staircases moving shit
I show you real harlem nights no shit going quick
Lil nigga got 25 before he turned 20
Now his so called homie fucking his girl, how friendly

[Hook:]
Cold nights cold as stair cases
Going hard where I'm from that's just a clear basics
Cold nights cold as stair cases
I don't know which is worse the snitch of the statement
Cold nights cold as stair cases
Cold nights cold as stair cases
Going hard where I'm from that's just a clear basics
