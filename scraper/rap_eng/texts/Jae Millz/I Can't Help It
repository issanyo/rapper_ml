[Verse 1]
Put any beat on, guarantee I’ma melt it
I used to battle block to block serving [?]
Her ass so fat I came fast like paramedics
I can’t help it, I can’t help it
Dick in her pussy, in her stomach she felt it
Last night we blew notes, that’s word to [?]
Fuck rap, I still get it so I sell it
I can’t help it, I’m a hustler
Your girl been thirsting for this dick so I fucked her
Yeah me and you ain’t never been cool, so boy fuck ya
I’m money hungry, when it’s cooking I smell it
I can’t help it, I can’t help it

[Chorus]
I’ma shine till the day I go
If they hating let ‘em know
I can’t help it
If it ain’t bout the money then it’s adios
My only conversation is that dough
I can’t help it

[Hook]
I’m from the bottom of that mud, I dug through
My blunt full and my cup too
If it’s fuck me, then it’s fuck you, I can’t help it
Forever shitting on my haters, I can’t help it
I’m sorry I can’t do no favors, I can’t help it

[Verse 2]
Fieri thirty days [?] that’s no frontin’
I pray to God I don’t get tried ‘cause I’m dumpin’
And this chip on my shoulder when I rap it’s embedded
I can’t help it, niggas hate it
But fuck a liar forgot the heart of David
Got back on my shit and now my life is amazin’
I’m champagne sipping, getting head from a blasian
She can’t help it, I’m that nigga
And all my OGs either pillers or killers
If it’s war we shoot at whoever witcha
Yes your honor I know what happened, but I’ll never tell it
I can’t help it
See I am no snitch, so my mouth is zipped
Niggas out here singing like Patti and shit
I’m talking LaBelle, informants are working and toss me in jail
New coupe watch the top get tossed in the tell
Fucking your bitch and I’m fucking her well
Beat it hard like I’m trying to hammer a nail
I’m winning these niggas are praying I fail
But if you can’t tell, I can’t help it

[Chorus]
I’ma shine till the day I go
If they hating let ‘em know
I can’t help it
If it ain’t bout the money then it’s adios
My only conversation is that dough
I can’t help it

[Hook] (x2)
I’m from the bottom of that mud, I dug through
My blunt full and my cup too
If it’s fuck me, then it’s fuck you, I can’t help it
Forever shitting on my haters, I can’t help it
I’m sorry I can’t do no favors, I can’t help it
