I had this bad bitch new rocks see
She said, Mack I'm a go home and suck sloppy
Just watch me

Is it another nigga bitch? probably
But who cares...
Man this can't relive out here
It is not fair
That ain't your bitch motherfucker just share
But I'm a drop her right back off I don't care
Oh you don't believe me nigga then just watch me
Next day I saw your bitch and I act cocky
Cause I will never let a bitch stop me
Cause I'm just tryin to get these millions
Feed my future children
Get on with my niggas and make a killing
Let go
I hit potent that lock
I say slamming my time
I get millions and grind
He says, ok fine
I say let go
I say let go
I say let go
I say let go
I hit mills on that lime
I save slobbers by time
To put your boy on it
A position to shine
He say let go
He say let go
He say let go
He say let go
So just watch me
I'm tryin to pop asap and make my jewels rocky
Jewels rocky
Let go
Let go
Let go
Let go
I'm tryin to creep through that door
Tryin to get that dough
Get on with my niggas
And Millzy boys I'm screaming
So just watch me
And watch all these fuck boys trying to copy

Just remember my name

Just remember how I came
So just watch me
And watch all these fuck boys tryin to copy
And all you bum bitches don't try to stop me
And all you other niggas don't try to pop me
So just watch me
