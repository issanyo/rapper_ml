[Hook]
Shine, shine, shine, shine
I be shining on them hoes
Shine, shine, shine, shine
I be shining on them hoes
Watch me shine, shine
Watch me shine
Watch me shine on them niggas
I’ll be shining, shining
I’ll be shining
I’ll be shining on them niggas

[Verse 1]
I don’t wanna talk I don’t wanna listen
I just wanna watch how my watch glisten
And baby I don’t give a damn ‘bout the time
I just like to watch how my watch glisten
I call it shining, they call it ignant
I tell a broke nigga, “Pay attention”
On Twitter I got haters all in my mentions
Same niggas you see at the light with fucked up engines
Go handle that, let me handle this
I show a Spanish bitch where the Atlantis is
They say I’m living reckless, I tell ‘em, “So?”
Since I can’t take it with me when I go, I’ll be shining

[Hook]
Shine, shine, shine, shine
I be shining on them hoes
Shine, shine, shine, shine
I be shining on them hoes
Watch me shine, shine
Watch me shine
Watch me shine on them niggas
I’ll be shining, shining
I’ll be shining
I’ll be shining on them niggas

[Verse 2]
They say be easy, I say I’m okay
I’m on that OG, these niggas owe Jae
Getting away with murder, wearing that he gotta chill
That jewelry bout as real as a three dollar bill
My Rolex gold, face color Champagne
Your Rolex make me laugh, circus gun, bang bang
They say I’m spending reckless, I tell ‘em, “So?”
Since I can’t take it with me when I go, I’ll be shining

[Hook]
Shine, shine, shine, shine
I be shining on them hoes
Shine, shine, shine, shine
I be shining on them hoes
Watch me shine, shine
Watch me shine
Watch me shine on them niggas
I’ll be shining, shining
I’ll be shining
I’ll be shining on them niggas
