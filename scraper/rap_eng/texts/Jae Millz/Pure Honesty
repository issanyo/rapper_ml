[Intro:]
Let me get a lil delay
Nothing that crazy tho
Uh
It's my type of go hard right here
Serious Sam

Aha, yea
Oh
Aha
Turn the beat down a little bit
Not that much
Smoke something bitch

[Verse 1:]
Niggas who been getting money since the 80's will tell you I'm a I'll nigga
I get love from real niggas who done killed niggas
Hitmen for hire, homicidal skill niggas
Where I'm from it ain't no hustlers leave in wheels nigga
They don't never expect to die, they just stay fresh and fly
Fuck me, there's something behind, look at them wheels nigga
But I'm way smarter than your average guy mister
From the streets of Nick Bonds but I'm on Guy Fischer
No sugar coatin, I keep it real if I ride with ya
I put paint on my wings and create a fly picture
The world's simpleminded so I make my rhymes clearer
They call it dumbin down, I say I'm simplifyin mirrors
Yankee fitted on my skull when I bought planes
Coupe so big, it feel like I'm in all the lanes
I son rappers like I went up in they moms unprotected
These niggas can't go back to they hoods, they don't respect it

[Hook:]
Bail with yo team, that's the only way to do it
Think of a masterplan, then execute it
Mama always told me I could do it
But the streets will make a young nigga ruthless uh
Stayin sucka free I shine
And I walk a million miles, took the smiles on my child hah
They hatin all the nigga tryna get it
Yea I know, but I ain't mad that's just the way it go
Goes, goes
That's why I keep one roll
Just in case it's my time to go

[Verse 2:]
Girls who been fly since Biggie was alive
I tell you I'm a smooth nigga
I'm so Harlem, so high but still cool nigga
Look in the mirror, ask yourself who is you nigga
You're nobody, your identity is your jewels nigga
I was raised with staircase dice games
Until the 200 meter dash
When cops go find a roof and pop one
Come down stairs out the next building, nice and plain
Be back with your homeys and finish up that dice game
Might leave that game with a nice gain
Or you might leave that game with some light change
Fuck it, just another day at the office
Semi-automatics for niggas that want a office
That's just life, I'm grindin get it, that's just a price
You say my girl ain't the baddest? I say she just right
I do it for the niggas with Rolls Royce dreams
Minus the ginger, we just wanna live like Rothstein

[Hook:]
Bail with yo team, that's the only way to do it
Think of a masterplan, then execute it
Mama always told me I could do it
But the streets will make a young nigga ruthless uh
Stayin sucka free I shine
And I walk a million miles, took the smiles on my child hah
They hatin all the nigga tryna get it
Yea I know, but I ain't mad that's just the way it go
Goes, goes
That's why I keep one roll
Just in case it's my time to go
