Seems like you ready, seems like you ready

Face down, ass up
Girl you know I love that shit
All I need is three or foe stroke
Bet that you gonna love this dick
I ain't the one you wanna cuddle with
'Cause I'll be the one you get in trouble with
My hands wonder and it seems like you ready to do some things
From a triple X scene
I can make you feel like you on that triple X screen
After the first time we fuck I can make you a feen
How I eat that pussy, eat that pussy
That sweet ass pussy And then I beat that pussy
Beat that pussy, sleep in that pussy all night baby
Like a psychic staring at a new born I can tell what you like baby and it....

[Chorus:]
Seems like you ready, seems like you ready
Seems like you ready, girl are you ready
To go all the way, all the way [x2]

Welcome to this private party
We ain't gotta tell nobody
Baby you won't be sorry
For coming here fucking with me
You can strip down naked if you want to
You can take it off, jump into the damn pool
I said welcome to this private party
And we ain't gotta tell nobody

[Chorus]

Face down, ass up
Girl you know you love that shit
I'll be on that other shit
Nuttin like the nigga you fucking with
That nigga lame as fuck
Tellem man up
Nowhere to bend you over
You gone get it while we stand up
All my niggas educated just in the hood way
And I'm so fucking disgusting just in a good way
Yeah we gone make a mess a filthy fucking mess
And if you wanna bring your girl
Baby be my fucking guest

Welcome to this private party
We ain't gotta tell nobody
Baby you won't be sorry
For coming here fucking with me
You can strip down naked if you want to
You can take it off, jump into the damn pool
I said welcome to this private party
And we ain't gotta tell nobody

[Chorus]
