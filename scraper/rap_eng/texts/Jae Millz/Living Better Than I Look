[Intro]
This that fifth wheel on the Cadillac music, right here
Pull up in front of the Lenox Lounge and hop out full in mink type shit, ha

[Verse 1]
I'm livin' better than I look
And might I add, I look goddamn good
Take a look, I look goddamn good
Rest in Peace Trayvon Martin I'm in my black hood
Go tell Geraldo we in our black hoods
Street corner politicians united from black hoods
I could get you punchlines, or get you something good
Like your weed man, flow smooth in dream land (cold ass nigga)
She bless me but I ain't sneeze ma'am
I'm respectful, do it and beg, get off your knees ma'am (Haha)
My momma made a king when she made me
So Lord bless your soul if you try to slay me
You kick dirt on my name, I'll kick dirt on your coffin
At your burial, and laugh like it's hysterical
Your album put me to sleep, should've been titled Theraflu
Charles Barkley voice: All you boys turrible

[Verse 2]
I'm livin' better than I look
And might I add, I look goddamn good
Take a look, I look goddamn good
Top down ocean drive like a Harlem nigga should
Yeah I do it like a Harlem nigga should
I ain't gotta talk swag, when you see me it's understood
They tell me if I dumb it down I might sell records faster
But if I dumb it down my fans won't respect me after (word)
Outta nothin' I made somethin'
Now I'm about to turn somethin' into everthin'
Tryna make these millions off these metaphors
Pimpin', the game is my bitch that's what I met her for
Yeah I'm livin' better than I look
And might I add, I look goddamn good
And my Cali girl pussy so goddamn good
Right after I lay this verse I just might fly to Hollywood
