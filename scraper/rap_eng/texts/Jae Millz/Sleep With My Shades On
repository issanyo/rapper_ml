[Intro:]
Uptown
I swear to God last night was one of the best nights of my life
Let me tell ya what I did

[Bridge:]
Last night I fell asleep with my shades on
Last night I fell asleep with my shades on
And I woke up like

[Verse 1:]
I don't fuck with niggas that don't fuck with me
They probly met their lady, wanna fuck with me
I do it big, yea double D
I'm a fuckin see, he a cup of tea
She wanna wrap my weight and I'm a let er
So if you love your girl you better get er
Cause I'm only in town for a night
And she is tryin to make this the night of my life
GTV mixed with the Sprite
And yea she like chicks but she ain't no dyke
She prefer the term bisexual
She don't hate on bad bitches, she call em edible
Man this freakin cold, I need Theraflu
All my niggas paid, poppin bottles, smoking medical
Shout out to them long leg girls with short dresses
Look at the way we living, you could tell the Lord blessed us

[Bridge:]
Last night I fell asleep with my shades on
Last night I fell asleep with my shades on
And I woke up like

[Hook:]
What a night, what a life
What a night, what a life
Tonight I'll probly fall asleep with my shades on

[Verse 2:]
In the club with my girls, yea I always wear my shades
And I'm lookin bum as fuck why you bitches are grenades
All my bills paid and I'm walkin with a swish nose
To the ceiling, you smell that, yea I'm the shit
Yea I talk a lot of shit but I can back it up
G String showin make these niggas wanna cup
And I'm trill as fuck, with the pretty ass face
With the soft ass, back side and the slim waist
Hell yea, a bitch fade and spillin a sup on the clothes
I be with a bunch of hoes, if you ballin you get toast
Yea I'm cold as fuck and I make it shake for a real ass nigga that ain't scared to eat the cake
(Leggo)
To the stack and I'm a eat it
All natural, that's why they wanna fuck with me
Blowin hella tree in the fuckin VIP
Jae Millz turnt up on the couch is fuckin sleep

[Bridge:]
Last night I fell asleep with my shades on
Last night I fell asleep with my shades on
And I woke up like

[Hook:]
What a night, what a life
What a night, what a life
Tonight I'll probly fall asleep with my shades on

[Outro:]
