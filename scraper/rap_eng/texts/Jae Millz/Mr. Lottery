[Verse 1: Fre$h (Short Dawg)]
Top down, looking very awesome
You can call me Mr. Lottery, Kevin Cossom
Keep that hammer on the side of me, obviously
Guess I have to get my hands dirty, like pottery
New semi auto, two clips of hollos
Try me, and I'll let the chopper spray like the lotto
That's word to the work I keep inside the taiho
You say you're doing numbers, we don't see them like Mavato
? lil daddy got m
More green the jets, more books than Harry Potter
And that's just an example what I keep in the arsonal
Awful, coming for the low like Marshall's
Plaing with my paper, put that pistol to your partners
Cock back, blast like it's a fossle
It's Short and Stunna, and we run m like the kids
You can get a deal if it's 10 or more

[Hook: Mack Maine]
? I say I got a lot of?
Doing numbers, you can call me Mr. Lottery
You should know I keep them choppers on the side of me
? never get it out of me
Call me Mr. Lottery, call me Mr. Lottery

[Verse 2: Jae Millz]
Call me Mr. Lottery, whenever you acknowledge me
Bitch, you talkin to money, whenever you say hi to me
You a bully, but my wrist got the box face, don't bother me
YMCM niggas, gettin it like that, obviously
Ronald Millz, superfly, who sharp as me
Told the car dealer fuck a charge, it'll be farari
These niggas watch, payed in full on they DVDs
I let them really watch, faded through my BYGs
True 80's baby, grew up in the crack aera
Harlem had me booked, gradguated to the Pack era
Then it went from that, to I wanna have better dreams
Bostin George dreams, I might have them every night forever
I'm proud to be making money in Manhatten
Them niggas know I get that 5, like niggas up in ?
Burberry duffle bag, it's still jet lagin
Took a lil trip, and then came back, and now they all laughing

[Hook: Mack Maine]

[Verse 3: Mack Maine]
Ok, call me Mr. Pie Man, call me Mr. Pie Man
And I ain't talking Lemon Meringue, you going for cars
Pacosso, Van Gogh, and the heats is drawn
I used to hustle from the night, to the early morn
See it was 28 scams, then 28 grams
Drug time, 18, they chargin 28, man
Back in Tenicy, I surved whoever was into me
You hurten, Stunna still got m, here's the remmody

[Verse 4: Birdman]
Hit a lick in 96 from a movie ship
Movin bricks, making moves on a hundred ships
Cherry wood on the bently, straight off the sand
In the kitchen, fish scailin, livin life grand
Lottery ticket, hit it on another didget
Blood Rich Gang, suppermoddle 10 figures
In the mud, heart went on my sleeve
Blood love, YMCMB
You heard, livin out of both streets
Flyer, paint on that new machine
No seeling and no roof on it
Chandelier, persion rug, 100 proof on it
Banana clip, shining with a hundred on me
Cash Money, a hundred gunners, repping it
Black diamonds, Canairey on that black white
H2, 1100 on that private flight

[Hook: Mack Maine]
