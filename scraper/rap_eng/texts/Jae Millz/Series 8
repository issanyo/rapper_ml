[Verse 1: Jae Millz]

The bigger the truk, the bigger the shoe is
The more that they hate the bigger I do it
The bigger the gun the bigger the bullet
The bigger the problem the quicker I pull it , BOW
I knew that I wold when they told me I wouldn’t
When they was eatin’ I was in the kitcken cooking
I do it from the heart so I don’t give a fuck
You niggas like the coach tryna win off luck
The jig is up, I’m on my hit ‘em up
And I ain’t go to FSU but I’m fuckin shit up
Without reaching I get ‘em touched
My niggas down for me
You don’t wanna see how they give it up
I drink out the bottle blow loud out the dutch
Nail ya baby mother than I hang my picture up
It’s clear as fuck
I’m bout to make all these high niggas on top fade
Like Shumpert hair cut, wassup


[Producer: Chi]

I go by the name of Chicago, my production company chi beats, and I’m representin’ Brooklyn Stickup also, that’s the squad.  It started with the real eerie sound in the back, it almost sounds like a bee swarm. Then uh, I just heard guitars underneath that just too keep it dark, it’s like a real dark feel to it.  Actually the only thing I did sample was the drum loop, and then you know I added my own drums to it but, yeah.  That’s pretty much how it came out


[Verse 2: Nems]

I don’t give a fuck about your resume nigga
You broke now
Livin’ in a shelter, Car broke down
Everybody go through hard times
But you been down on your luck for a minute nigga
You better grind
What’s on my mind is cashflow
I make six million a year that’s facts tho without rap
I used to rob niggas without gats
Got locked, did a bid came home than bounced back
Home invasion, where ya house at?
I don’t trust nobody nigga you better count that
And I’m watchin with my hand on the gun
Even my mother told me that she hate the man I become
Whatever tho
Me and my squad will chase you down with some weapons
Stomp you out than start to laugh at your facial expression
On the block or in the studio we basically chefin’
All my bitches love the flow
They just hate the aggression

Producer

What sets RapFest apart more than anything is the quality you guys bring, know what I mean? It’s one thing just to shoot a fuckin cipher, anybody can just stand in front of the camera and final cut and edit the shit but you guys bring a more creative aspect to it.  Which I think is really dope, so that’s what sets you guys apart.  But also with the whole networking thing, I think that’s another thing that sets the RapFest apart from everybody else

[Verse 3: Murda mook]

I’m heatin up
NBA Jam
This Rich Porter for 28 grams
Mike Jack white glove on his hand shit
Eddie Murphy with the tight leather pant I’m raw
Form the list to the corps
Just put a Cuban chain link on my door
Peep shoes tryna come up
How you gon’ keep my dick up can’t even keep ya bun up
Run up and get done up
Hit you wit 24 hours like sun up to sun up
Play the streets waist deep
So much Bass in the air I got Dre Beat
Never let ‘em slave me
I’ll serve ‘em indentured like fake teeth
Better tune it’s big shit
Like big shit
Heavy duty
