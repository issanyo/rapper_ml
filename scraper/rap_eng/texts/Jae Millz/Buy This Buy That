[Intro - Jae Millz]
Yo-yooo, Millz in this bitch
And he say fuck them hoes, fuck them hoes
Get money, fuck them hoes

[Verse 1 - Jae Millz]
What I’m ’bout? I’m ’bout money
That Young Money, that Cash Money
That
Clean money, that dirty money
That legit money and that bad money
I got
Hood bitches, got boojy bitches
Got swap meat and Gucci bitches
Got
Ratchet bitches, got classy bitches
Got field taken, always happy bitches

We on one, so I’m laughing nigga
Delete that, laughing at you nigga
Use
Coyntha, I’m nasty nigga
Except my skin a little blacker nigga
Crew of the
Year, the trophy remain home
Y’all Must Have Forgot, Roy Jones
Bad bitch
In my bed, her man home
He ’bout to take the kids to the park
She ’bout to
Take the dick to the dome
Hold up…
Swisher full of girl scout cookies

Fuck around with the fuck arounds
Choose up or down, where you wanna go?

Heaven or Hell, what’s goody? Talk to me

[Hook - Lil Wayne]
Buy this, buy that, but never buy no pussy
Never bite another nigga style, rather bite a bullet
Ain’t affiliated with fuck-niggas
My bitch Nina, she fuck niggas
Check the score, we up nigga
Treat my dick like a tongue twister

[Verse 2 - Lil Wayne]
Tunechi in this motherfucker, I’m paid like a motherfucker
Give her head like a concussion, upside down, her blood rushing
I’m homeless, bum rush em, fuck you nigga, that’s your fault
Yeah I set the bar high, tell them niggas pole vault
Uh, I don’t need light, my bitch light enough
Real animal, these niggas stuffed
These niggas pussies, tell em tighten up
Street sweeper, make a nigga bite the dust
Keep that millimeter, got an AK with a Chiquita
Bullet holes wide as receivers
Leave them pussies dry as the cleaners, haha
Watch me take off on that good
You keep talkin’ that shit, I’ll build a skate park in your hood
Tunechi

[Hook - Jae Millz]
Buy this, buy that, but never buy no pussy
Never bite another nigga style, rather bite a bullet

My bitch Nina, she fuck niggas
Check the score, we up nigga
At the top it’s just us nigga

[Verse 3 - Jae Millz]
YM, CM, I be that, word to Redman
I got no respect for these bitch niggas, all depths, left hand
My blunt big as a elephant, am I foreigner? You can tell I am
My cards out and my eyes Chinese, and my bitch Latin American
Ask Birdman, I’m a Big Tymer, Rich Gang, all my shit designer
New check, new Coupe, my roof disappear, call it Harold Miner
Tell the DJ let my haters know I’m in the building
Smoking on that medicated, this that Montel Williams
No talk show, I squash beef, no talk though, auto .44
Angelina Jo’, long nose, two hoes, one me
That’s a great sandwich, guess lunch was free
Your boys soft and y’all come to me, and my team in the league comfortably
Oww

[Hook - Lil Wayne & (Jae Millz)]
