[Intro]
Pacific Coast Highway
That's Malibu

[Pre-Hook]
No matter where I go in the world, I still remember
The day in California, felt like summer in the winter
Just the thought of you take me far away
So whenever I want and you're far away

[Hook]
I think Pacific Coast Highway
I think about ya, and when I think about ya
I think Pacific Coast Highway
Said I think about ya, and when I think about ya
I think Pacific Coast Highway
Said I think about ya, and when I think about ya
Just the thought of you take me far away
Said I think about ya, and when I think about ya

[Verse 1]
Riding out with my lady
Nowhere to go, just riding with my lady
We both got a problem with Anita Baker, guy
High five a Mary Blige ‘cause we babies from the 80s
It's nice day, shit, the weather like 80
Let's take a ride to the beach and just stare
Stare at the water and stare at the future
And think where we could go from here
Maybe to the top of the mountains
Maybe live on our own island
Or maybe we could start our own bank offshore
And live life forever wealthy in silence
I don't know, I'm just thinking
‘Cause I think about ya
And when I think about ya
I think about
How you stayed down when I was down and out
You work a nine to five but you my rider though
You helped me build this empire
I guess you my cookie, but I ain't lyin' though
Baby, you know my word is like dry cement
Solid as shit
And baby, I admit

[Pre-Hook]
No matter where I go in the world, I still remember
The day in California, felt like summer in the winter
Just the thought of you take me far away
So whenever I want and you're far away

[Hook]
I think Pacific Coast Highway
I think about ya, and when I think about ya
I think Pacific Coast Highway
Said I think about ya, and when I think about ya
I think Pacific Coast Highway
Said I think about ya, and when I think about ya
Just the thought of you take me far away
Said I think about ya, and when I think about ya

[Verse 2]
Riding out with my baby
Nowhere to go, just riding with my baby
We both got a problem bumping new edition Keith Sweat
And a lil Aaliyah ‘cause we babies from the 80s
You're my little secret, you cannot escape me
Like Jodeci said, you're forever my lady
That Malibu water look clear when it's wavy
Beach house or hand, just us fucking all crazy
I'm talking all crazy, I'm gone off the Henny
I'm liking your hips and you biting your lip
I can tell that you wanna be friendly
Throw on some Shotty ‘cause my love is kickin' in
Stronger than pride ever [?]
I love how the breeze from the beach make your hair blow
Behind you as if it was windy
That wine got you tipsy, we both feeling frisky
And baby, you stayed down when I was down and out
You work a nine to five but you my rider though
And our bond was built on many variations
But it came together like a kaleidoscope
So fuck what they think in my [?]
Baddest thing I seen and that's coast to coast
And most of all, I know you'd still be there if I was broke
And that's the reason why

[Pre-Hook]
No matter where I go in the world, I still remember
The day in California, felt like summer in the winter
Just the thought of you take me far away
So whenever I want and you're far away

I think Pacific Coast Highway
I think about ya, and when I think about ya
I think Pacific Coast Highway
Said I think about ya, and when I think about ya
I think Pacific Coast Highway
Said I think about ya, and when I think about ya
Just the thought of you take me far away
Said I think about ya, and when I think about ya
