I'm so intrigued, power (yeah)
Power, spark my, my ravenous appetite
I'm so intrigued (yeah you), by her
And I don't know how but I'm gonna show her, the power of the beast, tonight
I'm talkin' savage, feast on her body
Savage, like a beast on her body

Yeah, I don't know her, but of course she knows me
I look up, she's lookin' at me that mean she chose me
Or did I chose her? Or does it really matter?
We're connected through lust, so of course I'm lookin' at her
I love the way she put it in the beat so fancy
She dropped it low I can see she forgot her panties
She wanted me to see, I know that I ain't trippin' (yeah)
There's something 'bout a gorgeous woman that's free-lippin'
Sexual signals sent straight to my cock
Can I blame it on this ice covered in Ciroc (yeah)
I ain't lyin', I'm a lion
She's my feast, she goin' home with a beast
WHOOO~!

[Hook: T-Rone]
I'm so intrigued.. by her
And I don't know how but I'm gonna show her, the power of the beast, tonight

Savage, like a beast on her body

And no I won't give it to ya good, I'll give it to ya gooder

That ocean breeze'll crush yo back, it's brisk, I call it liftin'

And when it's first done I'm callin' ya cause.. OOOWWW~!

[Hook]

[Birdman]
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Head strong, leg room got it on
Different song, showed her how to hustle on
Palm trees, hundred mil, no seed
Out the pound, got it in til I saw a bead
Yeah, swervin' in my new shit
Bitches smell the money runnin' when they see the chips
Swaggin' on another flip
Yachts and boats and mansions when we in this bitch
Roll a seven, nigga hit 11
Uptown nigga hustle up in any weather
Fly rich, fly bitch, nigga we the shit
Poppin' GT Vodka, nigga born rich
