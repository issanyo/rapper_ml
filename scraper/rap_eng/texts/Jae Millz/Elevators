[Verse]
Always going forward like a bullet
Fuck what's behind me, I don't live in the wind
And they say jealousy's a female trait
But for some reason I always feel it for men
My homie [?] is hard out to me over a few blunts and a bottle of hen
Never changed [?] my day one
Still hang with niggas I hung with when I was ten
These rappers ain't my friends, they just rappers
We wasn't tight before and probably won't be after
But since we in the friendistry, we calling music industry
I'll probably be cool with niggas 'til I don't have to
That's just the nature of the game, what I'm a fuss for
I already know what I signed up for
Made more than I ever thought I would but tryna touch more
Is that greed or dedication
This the shit I be facing when I look in the mirror
But y'all don't hear me though
I got a cloudy mind but shit on niggas clearly though
Been nice since forever and a year ago
But now it's less about the rhymes and more business though
Y'all still don't hear me though
I know chicks that a set you up for some shoes and some shots
I know lil' niggas with guns bigger than the cops
I know lil' niggas with guns bigger than the swats
Listen to Lil' Durk, ready to die like big pop
You ask why, we ask why not
My niggas going back to extortion if I flop
Man of my words, stand tall like a high top
My man don't fuck with you, I don't fuck with you, that's how I rock
I don't go to church much, but I pray dearly
Cause I don't ever wanna call for help and Jesus fail me
I'm on a path to greatness, haters tryna derail me
But I'm the shit, you gotta smell me
Millz

[Outro] (x4)
Me and you
Your mama and your cousin too
Rolling down the strip on [?]
Coming up, slamming cadillac doors
