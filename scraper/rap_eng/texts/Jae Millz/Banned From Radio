[Verse]
My first thought in the morning
Is to kill your favorite rapper in this middle of this yawn
Wake up nigga, six straight up nigga
Before I see the L the future make up nigga
All you boys bitches, wet clothes 'bout to get add
Did head with the vaginas between their legs
I gotta think kick before you so cold nights
Rather extra height, rather spread the word
I'm in Vegas rappers, don't here to recycle, but try to just face it
Like I'm in wins, niggas slippers, niggas couldn't time my leaces
Only sell the pies, so we supplying the biggers
Dice game, big game, never supplying the wasters
Second place the first luces, so I strap for the greatest
The motherfuckers never love us, but I drive on Vegas
Get out of pocket, middle there, I'm a guard, you should see me bro
We favorite, my young boy, you look that simmy go
Whoever need it, you would end up in the e-on, respect your need
You could need that sucker shit louder
So I can hear you, that [?] hear lay loud, better get clear through
When them twin bout to pop, this is what I see it to
Holy further be with them, mother say I'm prayin' too
And been sick with this since the boogie man scared you
Flow stupid like a petal, on the motor vehicle
I'm a different type of nigga than this hoes use to
If I ever have seen em thirsty for a juice boo
Can't lie, got my own swag, from the choose crew
Shit is eye lose slim, like a sticky juicy fruit
Somebody go and tell you I got the choose to
Keep the forty believe low like bitch choose [?] if a nigga bust one
And we gonna shoot you
Shout out to my other town niggas in my down town, niggas
My cross down niggas in my other town niggas
Here's the other town nigga, don't get out of bounce nigga
Cause I get the mission starting never out of ran figure
Train the circus, use the fucking clown nigga
On my booky click shit, buck em down nigga
I'm tryin to get the table when we bust it down nigga
Shit that's probably three feens at the bustin now niggas, hold up
