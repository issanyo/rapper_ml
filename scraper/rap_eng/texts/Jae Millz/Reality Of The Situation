[Verse 1: Jae Millz]
My daughter need bodywash, papers and wipes
And her brother need new school clothes and Nike's
Sometimes I be like; "fuck the clubs, there's more to life"
They shot that boy in broad day, he never saw the night
My man just came home from sitting some years
He like; "yo where that album at, why shit ain't in gears?
What's up with Birdman, what's good with Wayne?"
My reply is always the same, you know the game
You got to play it, can't just say you're loyal you got to display it
And I'm so solid you can weigh it
Nigga I said my crown never faded
So I'm riding 'til the wheels fall off
And them mufflers scrape it, Young Money

[Hook]
It's just the reality of the situation
And some of you may ask; what's the situation?
I'm still trying to find out myself
Sometimes I look up to the sky for help
It's just the reality of the situation
And some of you may ask; what's the situation?
I'm still trying to find out myself
I guess it's times to lace up my shoes and tighten my belt

[Verse 2: Jae Millz]
I bet niggas want to know how I'm still afloat
Plus condos and [?] reaching at the coast
Went from a recording artist, to a CEO
And this is all with no album up in your nearest scoop
Fuck niggas, get money, fuck bitches too
And fuck a franchise, live for them people that live for you
Only family at the table so them thieves can't get in
I keep my circle airtight, the breaths can't even fit in
Lord, pray for me
And if I die today just have som wine and a girl at them gates for me
That identically resemble the mother of my daughter
I'd take her with me, but as far as my daughter, who'd be there for her?
That's a no-no
You ask, I don't know though
Mr. Overloyal with no budget for promo
Had to make it pop for myself
Stayed hot by myself
No appearances on albums
Had to keep my presence felt, nigga

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Jae Millz]
Smoking cigars, top floor me and my slime Vado
Been cool 20 years, ask Harlem, that's no lie though
Mob ties, unbreakable bonds but you can try though
We're still godfathers of each other kids 'til we die though
If you're a real nigga you look in the mirror
And take half of the blame before you point a finger
Kid said you can't get money, you're useless
And all you ever [?] had these excuses and that's real shit
My day one niggas I'm still with
We beef a bit, but understand that's who I'm still with
How many of you jocks say the same?
I'm loyal to my team, not loyal to my team's name
It's a difference, at least it is how I play
Never owned a surfboard, I don't ride waves
Only thing I'm missing is a fucking plat
Then the world gon' jump on my dick and that's a sad fact, but

[Hook]
