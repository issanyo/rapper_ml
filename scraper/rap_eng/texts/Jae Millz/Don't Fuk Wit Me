[Intro:]
Don't flirt with me, don't flirt with me
Unless you'll ship my ass off to sea
Don't flirt with me, don't flirt with me
Unless you'll ship my ass off to sea

[Verse 1:]
Look into the mind of a loner
Travel through the lungs of a stoner
I'm in a New York state of mind, smokin' on California
In Miami with a bitch from Arizona
Check me out, though...
I'm tryna get money 'til the day I die
Keep my hoodie low 'cause I stay high
Killin' my haters, good, no need to say "bye"
(Don't flirt with me)
Look, I ain't never worried 'bout another man
We was more worried 'bout them buttered grams
Sittin' by the fuckin' fan
Lord forgive me for my foulness
I ain't proud of this
But sometimes them clouds'll get in the way of the sunshine
I'm just speakin' from the mind, wasn't aiming for a punch line
My shooters pray you cross that frontline, so please...
(Don't flirt with me)

[Bridge:]
Don't flirt with me, don't flirt with me
Unless you'll ship my ass off to sea

[Verse 2:]
Me and my girl nymphos, I'll probably die in pussy
Fuck boy, you gon' die a pussy
Big difference â€“ big difference
You know, you Juko, I'm uno division
I see life through a certain vision
Bring the pain when I rhyme, and got them to listen
I'm the reason you battle rappers got a lame soul
(Don't flirt with me)
Look at twenty grave sites, my flow'll leave you under them
Can't compete with what your brain can't comprehend
I'm too witty, too New York City
When they start debatin' on the greatest I talk Biggie
Burnin' blunts 'til I pass out
But I don't pass out, so I'm just burning blunts
And I ain't tryna see jail for sending you to jail, so
(Don't flirt with me)
Please don't...
Smoke something, bitch...

[Bridge]

[Outro:]
Father Mills...
All praises due...
Don't flirt with me...
Don't flirt with me, don't flirt with me
Since you'll ship my ass off to sea
Mills in this bitch, Mills in this bitch
Mills in this bitch, Mills in this bitch, bitch
Don't flirt with me...
Don't flirt with me, don't flirt with me
Unless you'll ship my ass off to sea
I know I've been gone a long time
I'm back and I want what is mine
I know I've been gone a long time
I'm back and I want what is mine
