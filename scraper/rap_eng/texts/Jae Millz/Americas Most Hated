[Verse 1: Vado]

Vado Corleone, fire lansky rugby segal two eagle
Three piece suit attire fancy, pockets provolone
Entire family, repercussions discussions who coming
Supply the candy, U.N member, most hated for life
Rise of drug dealers, most made it with white
Loc made it the life, guap paying the price
My Glocks spraying it right, I hope I make it tonight

[Verse 2: Al Doe]
