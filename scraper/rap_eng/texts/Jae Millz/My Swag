[Chorus:]
Maybe it's my demeanor
Or the fact that my jewelery clean
Or the way i lean in the beemer
Or maybe its the fact that i'm the shit
Yeah I know what it is
My Swag My Swag
You can't get like me and you mad (Most Hated)
My Swag My Swag
I know You Prayed And Wished That You Had My Swag

[Verse 1:]
Young harlem nigga from the NY
Get money, spend money, stay fly
Those the 3 codes that I live by
Yeah I swerve through streets
But I travel in the sky
Pardon my swag that's the way the ave. raised me
Jae Millz bonafide baby of the 80's
White ice dark ceasar all wavy
Kicks say?? but Gucci is what my shades be
Lame nigga you can never say I'm corny
I stand like I got a million cash on
They ain't gotta move
Scott Storch will make em'
And I don't know why they hating
But...

[Chorus:]
Maybe it's my demeanor
Or the fact that my jewelery clean
Or the way i lean in the beemer
Or maybe its the fact that i'm the shit
Yeah I know what it is
My Swag My Swag
You can't get like me and you mad (Most Hated)
My Swag My Swag
I know You Prayed And Wished That You Had My Swag

[Verse 2:]
Take my word I ain't never go wrong
I got swag like a teflon don
A minute ago she said the patron was to strong
And now she hanging from my arm talking about I'm gone
I bet she never blew sacks of the chron
I bet she never knew the back was this long
I bet she never felt the wrath of king kong
Ate chocolate covered pretzels first class to Milan
I'm like King James but no I'm not Lebron
I'm just the president of Wanna Blow Productions
She can't believe I got all this from a song
Now it's uh uh uh...uh uh uh

[Chorus:]
Maybe it's my demeanor
Or the fact that my jewelery clean
Or the way I lean in the beemer
Or maybe its the fact that i'm the shit
Yeah I know what it is
My Swag My SWag
You can't get like me and you mad (Most Hated)
My Swag My Swag
I know You Prayed And Wished That You Had My Swag

[Bridge:]
My chain beamed up
My ears beamed up
My wrist beamed up
My fist beamed up
I said my rims beamed up
My whip beamed up
So fresh and so cleaned up
And you know it's wanna what

[Verse 3:]
I walk with a swag
Talk with a swag
Pull up to the curb polly and pull of with a swag
And when I'm down in ATL you know I roll with a swag
In Miami I leans in my F Crown with a swag
Even out in Houston I play the mall with a swag
When I'm out in California I play the Porsche with a swag
Homie maybe its the money, maybe its the grind, maybe its the way that I shine
Or maybe it's

[Chorus:]
Maybe it's my demeanor
Or the fact that my jewelery clean
Or the way i lean in the beemer
Or maybe its the fact that i'm the shit
Yeah I know what it is
My Swag My SWag
You can't get like me and you mad (Most Hated)
My Swag My Swag
I know You Prayed And Wished That You Had My Swag
