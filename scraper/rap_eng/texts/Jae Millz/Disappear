[Intro: Jae Millz]
Let’s get one motherfucking thing clear
Hater try me I’ma make his ass disappear
Poof, hater disappear, new coupe
Fuck all that shit man

[Verse 1: Jae Millz]
My connection have you go make all this disappear
I said no TSA on private flights I get ‘em here
Soon as them [?] touch I make ‘em disappear
I share the lick and make more than he clear in year
They trying to find ways to make me disappear
Politics as usual but still the hottest nigga here
I’m hungry and these suckers been getting rich for years
But they all in cruise control so watch me swerve and switch my gear
I’m on it, I’m on it, I promise I’ll sleep when I’m dead so no need for pajamas
I am a god, call me Adonis, I am the future I’m just being honest

I’m on it, I’m on it, I promise I’ll sleep when I’m dead so no need for pajamas
I am a god, call me Adonis, I am the future I’m just being honest
I’m all in her pussy but still in her stomach, you hating on me but my name on your tongue is
I got a new plug in, his price is the youngest, I’m straight to the money no need for a compass, hold up

[Bridge: Jae Millz]
Let’s get one motherfucking thing clear
Death any coward, that extendo make him disappear
Competition [?], point ‘em out I’ll make ‘em disappear
Your girlfriend put her lips right on my dick and made it disappear

[Hook: Jae Millz]
Let’s get one motherfucking thing clear
Hater try me I’ma make his ass disappear
Poof, hater disappear, new coupe
That roof just disappeared
Let’s get one motherfucking thing clear
If I woke up in that club your girl gon’ disappear
Poof, that bitch just disappeared
Where my cup of [?], I’ll make ‘em disappear

[Verse 2: Poo Mack]
Ain’t no competition niggas full of shit
Toilet full, no pot to piss in, got no hustle, broke as shit
I’m validated, unduplicated, Biggie on my city
Pac in mine, can’t replicate it, you’re outdated
I can disappear I’m out here, you [?] then don’t take the route here
My niggas strapped with outfit, that bullshit it don’t amount here
You get found here, that slump trunk, [?] niggas reckless
Bitches even whiling putting bitches on them stretchers
Check this, nah nigga [?] like chess
Make your next move your best, and never settle for less
I’m just blessed to be alive, I done been and I done seen it
Seen a nigga die in front me, and his own partners leaned him
Nigga life it ain’t no joke, blow something ain’t got no hope
My niggas still moving the dope, can’t stay stuck up or broke
Get cash or kill yourself, I got plenty workers plenty [?]
Raising hell, can’t stay in jail, I got the belt, can’t take a L

[Hook: Jae Millz]
Let’s get one motherfucking thing clear
Hater try me I’ma make his ass disappear
Poof, hater disappear, new coupe
That roof just disappeared
Let’s get one motherfucking thing clear
If I woke up in that club your girl gon’ disappear
