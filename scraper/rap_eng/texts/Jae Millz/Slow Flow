[Verse: Jae Millz]
I slow flows them to death
Walk straight in the booth with my mind right and go left
Yes, my lyrical presence is scary
I kick that unfungible, Adam [?]
Tell them little boys if they ready
Stop balling in JV's
Step on that Varsity caught in play D, baby
Girl know I'm all about my green, AC
Fighting night in AC
She blew me, no AC
Aye, see I be on that other shit
Had a plan to take over when rappers sported cross elephants

I slow flows them to death
Swag ignorant like parking a Rolls Royce in the jet
Shorty, 10 years ago I had rose gold on my neck
And that's before Young Money album went gold
I saw a check

I slow flows them to death
New York nigga, only right I feel B.I.G is the best
Fuck they talking about?
We was in them clubs Marvin they was trying to walk it out
We was slanging sour D's and crack grinding for anything
Then we swag surfing in them clubs doing the "Stinky Leg"
I'm usually on that potent, but tonight I need a drink instead
And a bad caramel bitch that get that pinky head
Got to make her spit and cum bubbles with that dick in her mouth
She even say "Millz you the best" without taking that dick out
I'm like WHAOUT
She talented but I'm immaculate
I think they starting to misstake my confidence as arrogans
That's why

I slow flows them to death
Talk through these verses and stretch my intellect
They can't get me a run for my money, nor jog with me
So, I reduce my speed to baby steps
You're welcome, pound key, I care
That place Neil Armstrong went, I'm there

I slow flows them to death (yes)
I slow flows them to death (aha)
