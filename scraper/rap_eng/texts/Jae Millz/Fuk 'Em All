[Hook: Mr. Piif]
Fuck all these niggas, fuck all these niggas
I can not trust ‘em and I need this dough
Fuck all these bitches, fuck all these bitches
I can not love ‘em, I can’t cuff no hoes

[Verse 1: Mr. Piif]
Man I need my money and I need my respect
Anything goes, man I’m riding with the set
I ain’t gotta front or gotta lie, we the best
Or we just finessing now we jugging for the check
I be on the block posted up by the street
Looking for the fiend trying to bust another lick
Cops on a nigga, had to run it to the dealer
[?] my momma crib, let a nigga hate, god damn, god damn
Y’all know I’m the man, y’all know I’m the man
Girl I’m happy that you came, [?]
For that pussy I’m a fiend, I’ma let her through the team
I’ma let her through the gang, nigga PO10NT is a gang
Fucking PO10NT to the brain, man we in a different lane
When I get up out the game bet you niggas know my name

[Hook: Mr. Piif]
Fuck all these niggas, fuck all these niggas
I can not trust ‘em and I need this dough
Fuck all these bitches, fuck all these bitches
I can not love ‘em, I can’t cuff no hoes

[Verse 2: Makarel]
I’m caught up in the crossfire, a real shit and ho shit
I came up on some work, yeah I’m trying to make the dope flip
My mission is chicken, my jewelry, gun glisten
Get me recognition, all the bitches pay attention
If it ain’t dough I gon’ miss it
I’m in the club and I look like a dog
Smelling like bud and I’m sipping on Moët
All the bitches know what’s up, every nigga with me thug
Yeah they sold drugs, or they be swiping some shit
I never judge man as long as they rich
I got Nate with me and he got a freak with him
I got Dion with me and he got the weed with him
I got Gudda with me and he got the lean with him
I got Lethal with me and he got [?]

[Hook: Mr. Piif]
Fuck all these niggas, fuck all these niggas
I can not trust ‘em and I need this dough
Fuck all these bitches, fuck all these bitches
I can not love ‘em, I can’t cuff no hoes

[Verse 3: Dave East]
Started in the Jeep and I just wanna get a Ghost
She keep fucking with her nose, I guarantee she want some coke
I was getting it for the low, set up shop right in the store
I ain’t care if it was coal, I’m just trying to get some more
Pull up in a new Ferrari, make ‘em ask me how I did it
Toilet paper, counting paper just in case a nigga shitting
Started out with nothing, just a phone and I was clicking
Now I’m selling niggas verses while my cuzzo selling chickens
I ain’t talking pot pies, KFC or Church’s
We could hit you and your bitch, get y’all matching hearses
Couple thousand for a feature ‘cause they know it’s worth it
We don’t do no accidents, I’m killing shit on purpose, watch how I murk it
Mak, Piif and Dave, hit sacks for some shades
Fendi fact, pop Fendi tags, racks on your frame
Pontiac for the drive by, smack while I aim
Contact from the haze, contract on your brain

[Hook: Mr. Piif]
Fuck all these niggas, fuck all these niggas
I can not trust ‘em and I need this dough
Fuck all these bitches, fuck all these bitches
I can not love ‘em, I can’t cuff no hoes
