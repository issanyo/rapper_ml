We on savage time all the time

[Verse 1: Jae Millz]
Watch this harlem nigga get all up in your guts
I ain't playing , where you at? Ight I'm pulling up
I been drinking Henny straight so right now i don't give a fuck
FYI don't have no pennies oh and you have been destruct
Oh yeah , I'm back Imma shoot these niggas better duck low now
Shabba ranks with the flow I got a trailer load now
All my bitches classy but still nasty on the low down
Fuck your bitch out she on her feet and on her toes now

[Chorus : Lil Wayne]
Soon as I take these pills and shit I feel alive
Soon as I start to give a shit that feeling die
Soon as I walk up to that bitch I feel her vibes
Soon as I wake up with that bitch that feeling die
Guess what Harlem , I feel aliiiiive
Guess what Harlem , I feel aliiiiive
Ok all time we still aliiiiive
Well excuse me as I kiss the sky

[Verse 2: Jae Millz]
Call up my team and then we roll out
They bring the bottles then we show out
Start up them coupes it's time to go now
Noon, you know I'm up so she going down
My ex want that old thing back I told her slow down
I got these hoes taking the boose , like they on moo town
All my niggas 'bout they money we chasin millions
These other niggas ain't grindin' they too stuck in their feelings
Move from N.O. to Atlanta call at Collegrove now
She was shy and squishy, dancing on that pole now
They was sleeping on me bet they ass woke now
Coupe black I call Iraq come through like war now

[Chorus : Lil Wayne]
Soon as I take these pills and shit I feel alive
Soon as I start to give her shit that feeling die
Soon as I walk up to that bitch I feel her vibes
Soon as I wake up with that bitch that feeling die
Guess what Harlem , I feel aliiiiive
Guess what Harlem , I feel aliiiiive
Ok all time we still aliiiiive
Well excuse me as I kiss the sky

[Verse 3: Jae Millz]
We bring out the animals when it get cold now
We got no reason man the diamonds just for show now
Got Ciroc and blue dream I'm in my mode now
Fuck these niggas Imma give 'em all the show now
Lights, camera, action, we pull up, up go the doors now
Put your bitch in my rotation marry go round
My harlem bitch was nice and slim she give me dough now
She fresh up out of surgery that ass is swole now
You boys clowns, I'm just toying with the flow now
Money coming in abundance it don't fold now
Trynna stop my wave, fuck around and wreck your boat now
Travis Scott shit 3500 for the coat now
Voice of the underdogs yo Millzy give'em hope now
Same niggas used to stunt on me they broke now
Same bitches used to front I'm in their throat now
My flow filthy, these bars need to be soaped down
Bruce Mills royal bay I got the glow now
Ric Flair aura hopping out the Rolls now
Tell 'em niggas who was hating watch me flow now
Tell 'em freak hoes fuck the threesome by my falls now

[Outro: Jae Millz & (Lil Wayne)]
Savage , no Randy (Mula), just savage
Rest in peace though ( Yeaaaah)
Millzy
