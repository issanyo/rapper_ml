[Intro: DJ E-Feezy]
You see? It’s four necessities in life
Fuckin the baddest bitches you only see on TV
Sippin on that GT in the VIP
Smoking the best weed from out of the country
And countin this money
Preferably by the hundreds

[Verse 1: Flow]
Red Chuck Taylors, red laces with my red socks
Red bandana round my gun with the red dot
And I only smoke Swisher Sweets out the red boxes
Bangin' like a rifle, I’m bloody like a headshot
Smoking on blunts wit the number one stunna
And he don’t even roll em, he just gut em then he stuff em
Since I’m with Young Money all these hoes wanna fuck me
But I’mma big dog and they tryna have puppies
Y'all better bool out before we stomp yall niggas
I’m from the east but I front just some uptown niggas
Yea bitch, you better learn how to thank
‘Fore I put this skateboard up and go and get that thang

[Hook: Flow]
I need to call up the herb man
So I can smoke a whole pound with The Birdman
Yea, yea you know I’m smoking scummy
And I’m bloody, if you aks me what I’m doin I’mma say I’m countin money
I like smoking weed and countin money
(We ain’t doin nothing but get money over here)
I like…
It’s Millz
Smokin weed and countin money

[Verse 2: Jae Millz]
Boy you moving too fast, don’t make me park ya
Still runnin with that 9 on me like Tony Parker
Bout that green like a Celtic fan, no doubt harder
I see mo green like I’m watchin The Godfather
Blue Dream in a swisha like where do I begin
The dollars, the euros, the pounds or the yen
On the jet with Birdman, we gon smoke about 10
When we land I’m getting off that bitch, blowin smoke in the wind
Straight reckless but I’m paid is the message
You niggas all signed the full of hate records
I’d kill for my watch, I’d die for my necklace
And I’ll ride for every motherfucker, reppin what I’m reppin
YMCMB

[Hook: Flow]
I need to call up the herb man
So I can smoke a whole pound with The Birdman
Yea, yea you know I’m smoking scummy
And I’m bloody, if you aks me what I’m doin I’mma say I’m countin money
I like smoking weed and countin money
I like… smokin weed and countin money

[Verse 3: Birdman]
Marble floors, mansions, the big house
20 acres, 20 cars on them big mountains
In the condo livin life
Top flow vibe, start 5 mics
A million cash off of Sasha sheets
Alligator on the concrete
Put my swag to the ceiling ho
Big money on the marble floors
We cash in and cash out
And get this money through them back routes
Holiday is everyday
100 million from them hard ways

[Hook: Flow]
I need to call up the herb man
So I can smoke a whole pound with The Birdman
Yea, yea you know I’m smoking scummy
And I’m bloody, if you aks me what I’m doin I’mma say I’m countin money
Countin money
Smokin weed and countin money
Countin money
Smokin weed and countin money

[Outro: Birdman]
Uptown niggas
Shoot first, ya understand?
Real nigga shit
Got the lil homie with ya
You know what it is nigga
YMCMB up nothing
Gorillas and goonas yea
More money than I ever seen
On my triple beam
Yea
Purple in my shit
It’s bigger than life boy
