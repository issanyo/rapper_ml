[Hook]
I know you love it, I know you love it
The way I do my thang, I know you love it
I know you love it, I know you love it
[?], but I know you love it
I know you love it, girl I know you love it
All of that pussy [?], girl I know you love it
The way I [?], I know you love it
My famo broke, I know you love it

[Verse]
Even if you don’t like me, you gotta love it
My girl enjoy the mall, she ain’t got a budget
Now fuck the law, I ain’t terrified of nothin’
Sirens flashing, lights of cop cars, only thing we out here dodgin’
If a nigga cross the line I gotta push the button
May the Lord be with him, when we see him it ain’t no discretion
That girl a freak, she wanna do more than touchin’
She on that molly late, ready to fuck in public
I know you love it, I know you love it
He ain’t nothing like me, baby I hear colors
I swear I’m so so different, thinking bout a dollar every minute
Hennessy got me tripping, get money my religion

[Hook]
I know you love it, I know you love it
The way I do my thang, I know you love it
I know you love it, I know you love it
[?], but I know you love it
I know you love it, girl I know you love it
All of that pussy [?], girl I know you love it
The way I [?], I know you love it
My famo broke, I know you love it
