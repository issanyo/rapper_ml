[Verse 1:]
This is why I'm hot
I dont gotta rap
I can sell a mill sell you nothing on the track
I represent New York
I got it on my back
And they say that we lost it
So I'mma bring it back
I love the dirty dirty
Coz niggas show me love
The ladies start to bounce
As soon as I hit the club
But in the Midwest
They love to take it slow
So when I hit the H
I watch you get it on the floor
And if you needed hyphy
I take it to the bay
Frisco to Sac town
They do it eryday
Coppin a Hollywood
As soon as I hit LA
I'm in that low low
I do it the cali way
And when I hit the Chi
People say that I'm fly
They like the way I dress they like (they like my) my attire
Move crowds from side to side
They ask me how I do it and simply I reply

[Chorus]

[Verse 2:]
This is why I'm hot
Catch me on the block
Every other day
Another bitch another drop
16 bars, 24 pop
44 songs, nigga gimme what you got
I'm in there driving cars
Push them off the lot
I'm into shutting stores down so I can shop
If you need a bird I can get it chopped
Tell ne what you need you know I get 'em by the flock
I call my hommie black meet me on the ave
I hit wash heights with the money in the bag
We into big spinners
See my pimping never dragged
Find me with different women that you niggas never had
For those who say they know me know I'm focused on my cream
Playa you come between you'd better focus on the beam
I keep it so feen the way you see me lean
And when I say I'm hot my nigga this is what I mean

[Chorus]

[Verse 3:]
This is why I'm hot
Shorty see the drop
Ask me what I paid and I say yeah I paid a ?quap?
And then I hit the switch that take away the top
So chicks around the way they call me cream of the crop
They hop in the car
I tell them all about
We hit the studio they say they like the way I record
I gave you black train and I did you wrong
So everytime I see them and they tell me that's their song
They say I'm the bomb
They love the way the charm hanging from the neck
And compliments the arm which compliments the ear then comes the gear
So when I hit the room the shorties stop and stare
Then niggas start to hate rearrange their face
Little do they know I keep them things by waistside
I reply nobody gotta die
Similar to lil wiz coz I got the fire

[Chorus]
