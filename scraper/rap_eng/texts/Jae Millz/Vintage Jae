[Intro:]
Yea
Millzie

[Verse 1:]
This is that
Soon as you hit the highway turn it up
Step on the gas soon as you light your blunt
My homey been locked up since '97
Just came home causin havoc, callin 911
Just last night on the block heard he emptied his weapon
Same thing he went to jail for in '97
Talk stupid, get a dome checker
Spray your with the AK, that's my home wrecker
I'm long gone
Posted uptown in New York
Smoking Cali with the South Beach, the bronze on
That was a random bar but it was hella clever
Sorta like a finished puzzle well put together
Bedrock must've brainwashed niggas
On how I used to wash niggas, squash niggas
Yea, yoga zoomin with the flow
Fuck truancy, I'll take em to school if they don't go
No matter where I go I'm in a brand new, came deep
I know the spirit a star but I thank it

[Hook:]
Hit the kill switch, this that black out kill shit
Lusty shanker, them gangsters is who I been with
Hundred pounds in an hour, yea that's a real flip
Hit the club and serve molly, we on that pill shit
Ha, that potent music in my 6
Spendin dead presidents, presidential my wrist
I fucked your bitch, home wrecker
Text playin, you playin the chrome
Watch it, Millz talk to em

[Verse 2:]
Yo, I'm like could hold you those pops
I got too much pride to work for sunny
Thanks but no thanks, I'm a make my own money
Fuck makin yo runs nigga, rather make my funds thicker
I learned what a bottom bitch was, readin iceberg slim
So you could blame all this pimp shit on him
Back in high-school I did the nautical sweatsuits
With the boats on the pocket, fly chubby nigga
Probably had yo ho as my sidekick
Now I be on some Dubai shit
And only deal with girls who do buy shit
W16 engine bout that achy
Sound like a bulding collapsing when I'm passing
I came from nothing, you can hear it when I'm rappin
Cause when I talk my shit I talk it with passion
Trust me when I say fuck these niggas
That is not a bar, that is from the heart
Whom you travelled through life is though the first in the car
Nigga movin too fast and drive and get popped

[Hook:]
Hit the kill switch, this that black out kill shit
Lusty shanker, them gangsters is who I been with
Hundred pounds in an hour, yea that's a real flip
Hit the club and serve molly, we on that pill shit
Ha, that potent music in my 6
Spendin dead presidents, presidential my wrist
I fucked your bitch, home wrecker
Text playin, you playin the chrome
Watch it, Millz talk to 'em
