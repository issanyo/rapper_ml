[Hook: French Montana]
I gotta let m know, before I go
When you can't get low, when you can't get higher
When you can't get low
You stuck in the middle
You stuck in the middle
Stuck in the middle

[Verse 1: Meeno]
Rich nigga, got a penthouse
Coke Wave, sit down
Now I bossed up, G 4s and escolaters
Stacks coming in, holla at your nigga later
[Hook: French Montana]
I gotta let m know, before I go
When you can't get low, when you can't get higher
When you can't get low
You stuck in the middle
You stuck in the middle
Stuck in the middle

[Verse 2: Jae Millz]
Tell your chick to come over, I bend that bitch over
Just a little
I'm all over the instremental
In 2.0 hours, all the work is our's
I fire up the boom, all the goons sit out there
All we got is block work, all the work is fire
Pump it til the block hurt, make it like the wire
We ain't tryna hire, only fuck with bosses
Stick it in the ziplock, only cars causts
Know my Mama proud of me
Roll another sour tree
Lil mama probably swalow me

[Hook: French Montana]
I gotta let m know, before I go
When you can't get low, when you can't get higher
When you can't get low
You stuck in the middle
You stuck in the middle
Stuck in the middle
