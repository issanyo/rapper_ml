[Intro: Jae Millz]
Back to your regular scheduled program
It's Milzy! Potent vibes only baby
If you're great at something, why not do it everyday?


[Verse 1: Jae Millz]
Lord, forgive me for my sins, I'm only human though
The Devil ain't taking no days off, what would you do though?
I'm bout my business, Janky niggas' think I'm arrogant
I'm just trying not to get robbed; no Kardashian
Whenever I step on a beat and drop a track again
Just know that I'm moving dope, yeah, you can call that trafficking
See, this that flow they start saying he back again
He never went no where though, you just turned your back on him
Yeah, I noticed, yeah, it's kool, I'm still living though
It's always better when the clouds just move out your vision though
Gotta do these niggas' like them old FEDS magazine pictures though
See the real and blur out the snitches though
I done looked death in the eyes a few times in the physical
So, whatever you trying to do, just know I'm with it though
I will literally kiss Journey on her forehead
Tell her "please forgive me", then you're all dead

[Chorus: Jae Millz]
Lord forgive me for the things I do not know
And forgive me for my sins as I grow
Lord forgive me if I only want the dough
Ain't no love at all but I already know
Lord forgive me if my heart turn cold
These streets done turned me to a monster, that's for sure
Lord forgive me if my product do not go
I refuse to ever ever sell my soul
I refuse to ever ever sell my soul
Lord forgive me if I only want the dough
Lord forgive me if my heart turn cold

[Verse 2: Jae Millz]
Lord forgive me for my sins, I'm only human though
Lord correct if I don't know what I'm doing though
They be like "Milzy, wassup, what you've been doing tho?"
I rather be a quiet winner than a loud loser though
I rather really get money and just rap like I'm doing so
I rather really be me then portray somebody you would know
I rather really go out the country and rap about it
Than just rap about it with no answers if you ask about it
No, I'm actually bout it, really on my 3rd passport
Almost on my 4th though and no, I never pass ports
I only pass the loud, only blow that potent
And the flow get ferocious whenever I get in motion
These rappers gotta be joking, I ain't laughing though
(?) talking my shit but they think I'm rapping though
Boy, I'm dead nice with this shit, a 6 feet ditch for you
Is what my mind dub
Yeah I've been busy but today I got time cuz
Yeah, I've been busy, no clubbing, been on my grind cuz
Now I'm taking my shots, this is what riding the pine does
Top of the mountain vibes, this is what learning a crime does
This not being scared of flying does

[Chorus: Jae Millz]
Lord forgive me for the things I do not know
And forgive me for my sins as I grow
Lord forgive me if I only want the dough
Ain't no love at all but I already know
Lord forgive me if my heart turn cold
These streets done turned me to a monster, that's for sure
Lord forgive me if my product do not go
I refuse to ever ever sell my soul
I refuse to ever ever sell my soul
Lord forgive me if I only want the dough
Lord forgive me if my heart turn cold
