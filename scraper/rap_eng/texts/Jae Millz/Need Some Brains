You wanna see some ass, I wanna see some cash
Keep'em dollars coming and that's gonna make me dance
And that's gonna make me dance, and that's gonna make me dance
Work it,.. make it,.. work it,.. make it... [x2]

Ok, I'm a need some brains bitch, I'm a need some brains [x4]
Open up your mouth put your hand back and go to the motherfucker thang bitch
Am I spending money, but is my pocket full?
Bitch you made enough money tonight I wish I would
... in my household,.. in your mouth hole
Why you worry how my bad room look?
You ain't even pass my fucking couch
Two nuts and you gotta bounce how
Unless I got another bitch down for
Two way big sucking party that's me on my feet and yo'll knees on the grounds
First I was nasty then I was still nasty now I'm even nasty...
... you're big comedy that's why she laughs at you
No lying and one night YMCM spit over 250 thousands, asking you to work...
... keep flying

Work it,.. make it,.. work it,.. make it... [x2]
Ok, I'm a need some brains bitch, I'm a need some brains [x4]

We gonna need some brains bitch, we gonna need some brains

And my last name is MILLZ
Heads up... all niggers
Shout out... reporter to all my niggers
