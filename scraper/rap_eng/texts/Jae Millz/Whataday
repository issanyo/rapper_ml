[Hook:]
All I wanna do is smoke the best weed
And get wealthy before I die
They said I wasn't on my grind
And my bet is you's a motherfucking liar
She says she's never been with girls
But with me she'll give anything a try
And as I'm preparing these shots
The gt vodka I can see it in her eye
She can't wait to do it
Whataday whataday
Whataday whataday

[Verse:]
Good breeze, good weed
Good drink in my CUP
Real world but no road rules
My life's something like MTV
I told that girl I'm a say these boys
So I feel weird when it get too quiet
I'm used to loud core these loud neighbors
Loud gunshots and them loud sirens
That's why I need loud plants
Matter of fact what a loud man
Soon as I plane jump out the clouds lean
I'm like where the loud men
Never knew I could
Now they like how could he got a red bone girl
With a wet pink pussy
Got a dark skin smell like Shay but her slim waste
No stomach ass fat like a bulimic
God damn, heard that hoe nigga still hatin
About to be on my third goal presidential
Got that sting in the still waiting
You niggas lay away
At least that's what your paper for saying
I make money never made a statement
I'm elevated that's ABA shit

[Hook:]
All I wanna do is smoke the best weed
And get wealthy before I die
They said I wasn't on my grind
And my bet is you's a motherfucking liar
She says she's never been with girls
But with me she'll give anything a try
And as I'm preparing these shots
The gt vodka I can see it in her eye
She can't wait to do it
Whataday whataday
Whataday whataday

Oh my my, I'm feeling high
I'm on that stroll
I'm in my zone
Now all these hating niggas sleep
Couldn't work keeps turning down
Oh whataday
Whataday, whataday
Bitch
Oh whataday, whataday
Whataday, whataday
Whataday, whataday
So potent
Whataday, whataday
All I wanna do is smoke the best weed
And get wealthy before I die
