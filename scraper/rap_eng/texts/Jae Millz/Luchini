[Intro]
Oh man,oh boy! 1990+

[Hook]
Luchini coming from the sky
You can't quit, boy
We pop the corps in a [?]
Boy, boy, boy ,go

[Verse 1]
I'm wanted for spitting but it ain't about me
Now it's all about the presentation and the timing
Low quality, media, video
And in a main presence,mainstream [?]
Welcome to the rap game,now you're on the radio
DJ spinning the record,you hate it though
DJ spinning your record,but they wouldn't recognize it
Had a month ago ,just started praying a day ago
Niggas ain't addicted but I feel like they're trying to block me
Stop me from getting to the go
Try to stop me from reaching to the go
Me and my Dali girl,we'when it's cold
She leaves on her way but she's sitting on her toes
Caught on the camp floor
Caught on the dance floor
You can't sleep with it until [?]
Father like grando, I feel like shit
You should fly the bando
A lot of niggas say
They started it real low
[?] up town, showing my city real low
Fucking my apartment, that's my fan, wow
We're putting the problem
From the hand to the bran,though
And I'm the motherfucking leader
If you swallow them fucking haters
I will drip your fucking leaders
I ain't fucking with you
But you ain't fucking with me either
Both niggas are rappers
You are some kind of motherfucking divas
Getting on my security I still got on my features
Still shining, still walking with that walk
And I ain't even got a date yet
Couple of niggas might have passed me
But they didn't say anything
And that's a promise motherfucking nigga
Ima make it right

[Hook]
