[Intro]
Cash flow, everything around me cool
Get the money, dolla dolla bill, yo!

[Verse]
Ever since a youngin I was told to go get it
Fuck anybody who ain't with it
Used to blame hayes for the heights on my homeboy's Civic
On the West Side highway
I want the cream, no latte
These young shooters do what I say
I'm something like Ma Jackson
Team full of warriors, team full of storiers
That's why your girl rode the bus for States
Like she on tour with us
Now let me
Switch my flow and bring it back on them
True flow I reveal, never react on them
Millz go to work like the shirt tucked in the slacks on 'em
Your men hicked my killers pressed relaxed on them
Big guns blow his chest through the back of 'em
I know you thinking why his team wasn't in back of them
Back on my bag with these niggas, send them to the pussies
Send them pads on these niggas
And let them know Millz ain't nothing to fuck with
That ain't no skill, motherfucker, that luck shit
Know a couple of Puerto Ricans that would cut you
Put a gun in your faces
Ten times out of ten stitches with the cases
7.50 be my BBS, that's the basis
Presidential face lift
New condo in the Woods, hell is spacious
Three free hoes begging me to tape it
Millz flow is so so death, you can't escape it
Colorado beats, like Toby, yeah, I rape it
Now who wanna be my dinner?
I kill niggas like that house in Virginia
And I ain't even take off my coat yet
Haters get it, I ain't even take my dick out their throat yet
Oh, rest in peace old dirty love
You ain't gone but I know your spirit hurt me though
Fake niggas playing games like they for sure
Well, I'mma play director and get your curtain closed
Sweat shop, grind with mine, I be working hoes
I'm on an ass like Valencia, call me Sergio
I'm a barracuda unbarracaded
Shout out to my scar faces incarcerated
Nigga had dreams like Tony did
Can't blame him, he was raised spoiled, only kid
Never had joints, he felt left out
So that stoop in the corner was his best route
Best way to provide the best way out
Nobody want him, let that [?] let him raided out
Lawyer fees, grew stash, money faded out
Now tell these Jokers what this play's about!
Main reason I put it out everyday is that I with it
Won't stop to my [?] got a link
You niggas out here playin', I'm out here wiggin'
You niggas get comfy, my competition - my dinner and I'm hungry
Niggas talk that shit but don't [?] me
I be everywhere [?], on a pilot shit
Get [?] then I meant that
We dated we can [?], if we seen that
Bullshit this way, fuck all that tomorrow shit
Gon' get it this way [?]
