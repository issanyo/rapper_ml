I hate to turn up out of the blue uninvited
But I couldn't stay away, I couldn't fight it
I'd hoped you'd see my face and that you'd be reminded
That for me it isn't over

Yo, I just got a phone call
It was a international number
And I've been tryna keep my money right
But I'm getting confused and I wait international numbers
I'm higher than the ceiling of an airplane
Exchanging currency, I currency exchange
I was stuck to guard, exposed me to that scenic route
I gotta be blessed, been booked all year with no single line
They wanna know how I do it
I tell them "if you listen your answer is in the music"
Not fiction, I'm one of the truest
But I guess getting that platinum plaques the only way to prove it
Met a chick on Twitter, fewer out the next week
Her ashot and her avies, the reason he met my bed sheats
Pizza rock, smoking on purp sticks
Uninvited guests (it's young...)

I hate to turn up out of the blue uninvited
But I couldn't stay away, I couldn't fight it
I'd hoped you'd see my face and that you'd be reminded
That for me it isn't over

Never mind, I'll find someone like you
I wish nothing but the best for you too
Don't forget me, I beg
I remember you said
"Sometimes it lasts in love but sometimes it hurts instead."
"Sometimes it lasts in love but sometimes it hurts instead."
Yeah

Had a girl but I ain't need one
Cause after two minutes around her ass I need a blunt
You know the type – always make problems out of something
The type of chick that know it all but got nothing
That I can't see, baby girl I'm lined to that
Presidential on my arm but I ain't got the time for that
Thought she was a woman but I guess I broke a girl's heart
Now she through her laptop every time I'm up on World Star

I hate to turn up out of the blue uninvited
But I couldn't stay away, I couldn't fight it
I'd hoped you'd see my face and that you'd be reminded
That for me it isn't over

Yo, I've been in another zone lately
But feelin' like I need to call lately
Cause at the rate these niggas goin'
In a couple of months or so they're gonna run out of space to hate me
I'm sucker free and that will never change
You know my niggas the same – allergic for lames
Attracted to dollars, I'm glued to my grind
Nail to my hustle, uninvited guests with a shuffle

I hate to turn up out of the blue uninvited
But I couldn't stay away, I couldn't fight it
I'd hoped you'd see my face and that you'd be reminded
That for me it isn't over

I hope you see this face and be reminded it ain't over

Never mind, I'll find someone like you
I wish nothing but the best for you too (that's what they all say)
Don't forget me, I beg (they wish me the best)
I remember you said (don't forget me, Millzy)
"Sometimes it lasts in love but sometimes it hurts instead." (fuck out here, I never remembered)
"Sometimes it lasts in love but sometimes it hurts instead." (that's the lesson)
Yeah (oh yea, it hurt)
