[Hook] x2
I got the block so hot the hood meltin'
Homie I got the block so hot the streets meltin'
Nigga get ya hands up
We 'bout the paper
Girl get ya hands up
We 'bout the paper (Oh!)

[Verse 1]
I got my East Coast connect
Got West Coast connects
Get dirty-dirty love
Got N.Y. respect
Got an MI-AK
Got an ATL fam
That'll swoop me in the lane
Soon after a nigga land
I got G's that'll thug for me
Homies that'll buck for me
Even in the city where the [hell you be it's ...]
Wait a minute!
Naw I ain't finished yet
Got the [Inner Crew] connects
Just in case you disrespect
Got half an old flow
Spit bricks when I rap
Got the city on my back
Got Swizz on the track
We can bet it any day
Any how or any way
Ask around they all know Jae
And I guarantee they say!

[Hook]

[Verse:]
I got my inner street connects
Gotta limp when I step
Got - pimps that respect
Got my inner street connects
Got my downtown connects
Got my uptown connects
Got a chick in Foot Locker
She my uptown connect
I got the block so hot the street meltin'
Niggas can't compete, one-on-one that need helpin'
Please -
Wait a minute!
Naw I ain't finished yet
Gotta set it on connect
And she love to catch the ???
Got a slanted-eye chick
Got a curvy thigh chick
Got a 9 To 5 pass the check ride-or-die chick
Got a Denim-jean Timbaland Size 5 chick
And I ain't gotta G a ho
Cause she already know!

[Hook]

I got my Double R connects
Got my Terror Squad connects
Plus I'm very well connected with the F to the S
Grand Hustle knows my boys
Plus I rock with Dipset
Got my Bad Boy connects
Don't believe me you can check
Niggas love me from the blocks in Harlem to the Mid-West
To the shackles up North where they grind and doin' sex
Wait a minute!
Nah it's cool I'm almost finished
Ain't nobody pressed for time as long as the DJ spinnin'
Got - everybody bouncin'
All the dudes grindin'
The chicks backin' it up on whoever that's behind them
See danger's what I am
And I ain't talkin 'bout a gun
When I say Swizz put a banger in my hands
