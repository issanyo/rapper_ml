[Hook]
I want it all
I want it all, want it all, want it all, want it all, want it all
Haters praying I fall
Fuck 'em all, fuck 'em all, fuck 'em all, fuck 'em all, fuck 'em all
And let them hoes know I'ma ball
I'ma ball, I'ma ball, I'ma ball, I'ma ball, I'ma ball
And I don't want some, I want it all
I want it all, want it all, want it all, want it all, want it all
I want it all

[Verse]
And your girlfriend wanna get lost, get lost, get lost, get lost (So I put her on a flight)
Bad ass bitch but she small
So I fucking brush her off, brush her off, brush her off, brush her off, brush her off (Then I send her right back)
Do it for my city and my dogs
Started from the bottom, now we on the top floor and the stacks stand tall (We getting money)
Where my money at, no sharks
I want it all, want it all, want it all, want it all, want it all
Shooters on deck and on call
And he will let it off, let it off, let it off, let it off, let it off
Still Young Money of course
And Wayne still a boss, still a boss, and the team still never took a lose
You niggas looking lost, but if your girl pussy soft, let her know I don't want some

[Hook]
I want it all
I want it all, want it all, want it all, want it all, want it all
Haters praying I fall
Fuck 'em all, fuck 'em all, fuck 'em all, fuck 'em all, fuck 'em all
And let them hoes know I'ma ball
I'ma ball, I'ma ball, I'ma ball, I'ma ball, I'ma ball
And I don't want some, I want it all
I want it all, want it all, want it all, want it all, want it all
I want it all
I want it all, want it all, want it all, want it all, want it all
