[Verse 1:]
Can I hit it in the morning? Let me start yo day off
I could be your pilot, prepare for takeoff
All my niggas criminals, crooked, made off
Rolling like Jordan, every final's in the playoffs
Baby you could get it now, you could get all of it
Let a nigga get up on yo back like walla kit
Closet full of fly shit, here she got her cake up
It's full of Mike & Moore, that's cause and Jacobs

[Hook:]
She baddd and she too sexy to say she got swag
Could tell she bout the money, buy shoes in bag
Just broke up with her ex, I know tonight she got a man
She baddd and she too sexy to say she got swag
Could tell she bout the money, buy shoes in bag
Just broke up with her ex, I know tonight she got a man

[Verse 2:]
Catch me in the club, on the couch, let me smoke up
Not too much jewelry on but I got a glow on
Uptown nigga so Harlem if you don't know
I'm so so death when it come to being broke though
Baby bust it open, let me see wutchu twerkin with
But I don't want it too easy, baby make me work a bit
Make it make it jump, yea baby trampoline that shit
She threw it back with terror on my squad I had to lean back
YMCM to the B, that's for bank
We ball how we can cause we all what ya'll ain't
And you cannot do any invert or coach bag er
Footlocker a gapper cause she a 5th aver

[Hook:]
She baddd and she too sexy to say she got swag
Could tell she bout the money, buy shoes in bag
Just broke up with her ex, I know tonight she got a man
She baddd and she too sexy to say she got swag
Could tell she bout the money, buy shoes in bag
Just broke up with her ex, I know tonight she got a man

[Verse 3:]
Can you hit it in the morning? When the sun's rising
Take this out, dick hard, I can see it rising
Oh but it's no surprising when these niggas call me bad
I'm a bad bitch than these other bitches looking at
Know it's my swag bitch I'm nasty
Had you rippin out my fuckin pictures in the magazine
Lingerie two piece in my hot biscuits
If you got your dollars up maybe you can get it
I like Zara's, Fendy, Gucci, Prada
If you said you want some coochie, you ain't getting nada
Nigga if you talk fly shit and you try fly whips
Take me on flight trips, give me 9 inch dick

[Hook:]
She baddd and she too sexy to say she got swag
Could tell she bout the money, buy shoes in bag
Just broke up with her ex, I know tonight she got a man
She baddd and she too sexy to say she got swag
Could tell she bout the money, buy shoes in bag
Just broke up with her ex, I know tonight she got a man

[Outro:]
Yea, I'm bad, I'm bad
Bad than a motherfucker
I'm bad, I'm bad
(Leggo)
Bad than a motherfucker
Yea, I'm bad, I'm bad
(Jae Millz on the beat)
Bad than a motherfucker
(Beautifull April, Millzie)
I'm bad, I'm bad
Bad than a motherfucker
