[Hook x2]
I'm real as it comes
I'm real as it comes
I'm real as it comes
My style is ridiculous

[Verse 1: Jae Millz]
Since I killed shit I got to pay the prize
So for that, to the streets I'm doing life
Where I'm from the king of New York ain't Frank White
Because the real king of New York died on March night
R.I.P B.I.G
[?] he replied true indeed
Fuck all the of the blogging and social chitchat
I break them down bar for bar, no KitKat
My girl conceited like Remy, yeah the bitch bad
Stay on fifth ave. when the sunset she switches bags
Air Force 1's with the straps hanging
Nigga your car ain't bulletproof, that's mad painting
Play around and get played
I beat the street, real spit don't get sprayed
Flow like I'm a remix of 88 Kane
My weed stronger than Bane
My girl's ass insane
And all of these niggas lame, what it is

[Hook x2]

[Verse 2: Jae Millz]
Right about now the city need Millz
I'm trying to restore the feeling, no e-pill
Mind state like Tyson training in Peekskill
I don't give a fuck if that's your girl, nigga she will
You rap niggas were sweet then and you're sweet still
Rectangular pine box-flow, now sleep still
I'm dead serious
Russel ain't never signed you, you ain't deaf I know you hearing this
Clarence pissed that third bottle of water
I put this on my daughter
No sergeant but I slaughtered, in that order
Wash. Heights, find us loud in my dutch
Who want to wash Heights fass asses in my trunk?
Them highway pants and them hills got that thing sitting right
She got to know I want to touch, what the fuck?
If you want to serve raw, then you know where it's at
I walk in, they looking like Chris Porter is back
But it's Millz
