Now all my gangstas and my hustlers stacking bucks get up
My trainees in West Indies in the cut get up!
Lick off a shot if you're bumping wit Jae Millz
And if the bouncer be like 'chill', tell em (no no no)
Those dudes lame, we ain't the same as them
My crew move, all shots our style like BIGs, Wayne and them
But if them boys catch me slipping, I ain't naming them
They ask for info, I'm like (no no no)
My homeboys got bad tempers, and there's no controlling them
So if you say you holding them, you better be unloading them
Cause I'll have your Reverend standing up at your podium
Your momma falling over him like (no no no)
Plus recently I been watching a lot of cats
Cause this game got me prepared for all types of acts

That's why when you reach for daps I'm like (no no no)

Yo in school I was a rude boy
Now I move around wit respect of rude bwoys
Murderers and crude boys; So be cool boy
Matter a fact, click clak, don't move boy! (no no no)
My mens clap shit that sound like bombs when they blast off
Pussy, you will have your thoughts on your dashboard
Be careful brother you might get just what you asked for
And I ain't talking rap dawg (no no no)
Mi pesos short, no time for rhyming wars
You talking bars, I'm talking more like Saddam and George
Stop all the hatred, cause once you see that thang
Only thing you gon say is (no no no)
You niggas basic, I'm nothing to play wit
Aim at your grill, I'm not trying to graze it
So before you think about coming at me
Think about what the track say (no no no)
