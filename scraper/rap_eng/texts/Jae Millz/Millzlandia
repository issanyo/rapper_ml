[Verse 1:]
She so cool call her summer breeze
Shots tease me limb gun varies
Stoner girl never done it
She don't weigh that many pounds
But she blow a tone of weed
She's the type of girl that I need
She watch the game with me no matter what the season be
NFL, MLB, NBA
Even in the jail, she down every day
She like different things but it's ok
She like Maroon 5, she like Coldplay
But still she like to listen to the Old J's
Most deaf child live in the OA
She don't watch movies like quarantines
They put on step brothers or high tub time machines
When she was in school I wanted her with my letterman
Check it with my name engraved, baby represent

[Hook:]
Baby girl, welcome to my world
Don't you worry about a thing
And live by old days
But it's just me and you
It's just me and you
So do what you do
'Cause it's just me and you
Do your thing babe

[Verse 2:]
She so nice she don't need a tan
Golden girl like dark gray and blanch
Nice walk with a better stance
God damn you can see it through her sweat pants
Where the D's what that girl poison, DVD
Crazy, sexy, cool call her TOC
She sound so cute saying pass that
And she ain't afraid of the gas mask
Tryin to pass a cig and she won't accept it
Ye that's my little stoner red
Always been a hundred never been a fake hoe
Not a snicker head but she got them jays dough
Bad bitch in her pair 23
And she works 'em like the letter in them double C's
I might just pull up on a show with her
Back stage might burn down the old with her

[Hook:]
Baby girl, welcome to my world
Don't you worry about a thing
And live by old days
But it's just me and you
It's just me and you
So do what you do
'Cause it's just me and you
Do your thing babe
