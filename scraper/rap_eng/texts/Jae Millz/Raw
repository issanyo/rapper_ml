Yo

Young Money red devils all we do is win and then
Get our Michael Phelps on with these bitches yeah we swim in them
Showing off this man enjoy, scrubs can't stand this boy

And that internet dissin I ain't got the energy
Cuz niggas is tough talkers with queer tendencies
Fuck the kid shit im grown and bout my dollars

Mack Maine:
Bitch I'm Mack Maine, uh
You are now tuned in to one of realist to do this shit
I spit proverbs, they spit foolishness
I spit the truth and shit, they spittin tall tales
If life's a test, I pass and yall all fail
I bring you all hell, my words should be written in red
A psychic came up to me one day and this what he said
He said "Jermaine, on the mic, I can tell you nice
You touch hearts, you might be the second coming of Christ."
I said "No Blasphemy" and proceeded to some other shit
Like put my rubber on and holla "Fuck the government!"
Respect my mind motherfucka, I'm a rider
As long as I'm alive ain't no law that I abide by
Fuck a drive, by we walk up and squeeze to get paid
This game ain't the same, Pac turning in his grave
If I dont make it to the top I know Gudda will
And I'mma help him call the shots, welcome to guddaville!
