[Intro]
That shit sound good, nigga
Millzy

(Verse 1: Jae Millz)
Money on my mind, fuck the bullshit
My security is a full clip
Niggas talking slick, but their hearts are dry
Wanna impress me send your enemy to the sky
I'm tired of all these corny ass rappers
So called trappers, telling their story backwards
Talking all that white shit, you ain't never had it
Post office visits, only time you stamp the package
Shame on me for yet to have an album in a wrapper
But nigga shame on you for every album getting wacker
Ain't you a dick rider, switch sider
Certified click hoppa', still getting nada
Niggas cat fighting with the team on that sneak shit
Making diss records but keeping it secret
Throwing darts like a bitch instead of bombing like a warrior
Just let me know it's some pussy in all of y'all, what's up nigga

[Hook x2]
I'm hearing voices (hearing voices)
Hearing voices (hearing voices)
Hearing voices (hearing voices in my head)
What they say? (go bomb on these niggas)
Man something ain't right, fuck is wrong with these niggas?

[Verse 2: Jae Millz]
Sucka' ass, nigga
Never moved a brick you old fronting ass nigga
What happened to them chains, say something about that, nigga?
You's a peon, pissed off cause we on
Getting dead presidents and ain't no cleons
But I heard your man talking to them people, nigga
I heard a couple states got killers trying to see you, nigga
Cut the bullshit you came from a great home
Never missed a meal and in your city; that is well known
If you really had that work like you said you do
When the Empire fell they would've came to get you
But since your man sitting up and you out here riding dicks, evidently that shit wasn't true
We mobbed up over here nigga, yeah nigga
Change your address to up there, nigga
And just to be clear nigga I dare a nigga
We in the same game see each other everywhere, nigga
What up

[Hook x2]

[Verse 3: Jae Millz]
Fuck everybody trying to come at YMCMB
If you fall under that umbrella, it's whatever
May the lord be with you when them hollow tips hit you
Your label mates and CEO gon' cry and then forget you
Sign somebody else and keep it moving like the mailman
Why yo bitch ass rotting in hell, damn?
Father forgive us, but thy shall not let any pretenders come against us
Behead them, dead them
Let that leave the studio, who the fuck let him?
Who the fuck okeyed that, lay him down wave cap
No grease, all war
No peace, all action
No tweets and when you see me nigga please don't speak
Just be about all that shit you've been rapping about
Be a man of your word nigga carry it out
Fuck your raps, fuck your rep and fuck you
Be the one to expose your life, I would love to, motherfucker

[Hook x2]

[Outro]
Understand me I don't even know you man
I mean I didn't even know y'all niggas exist
Y'all niggas causing beef, all you doing is making yourself hot you not affecting me nigga I got cake
If I wanted you touched, you'd be touched
I be sitting in motherfucking Hawaii, sipping on Pi√±a Colada
You making me sick, actually I'm laughing at you, we're all laughing at you
Matter of fact, do what you gotta do man don't call me man
Forget it, if it's gon' happen it's gon' happen, alright
