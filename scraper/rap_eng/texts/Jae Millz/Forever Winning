If not us then who, leggo

[Hook]
Young money, we the hardest team
Forever winning bitch, we on our Charlie Sheen
Make that ass jump, girl do your damn thing
We bout that life, and them niggas ain't bout a damn thing

[Jae Millz Verse 1]
Okay, they say time is money, and most say life is short
So I chase my dollar signs and let that bullshit walk
You in that bullshit? You might as well walk
I'm in the air first class, pound key, can't talk, sorry
Look in my eyes and you gonna see its a real nigga
No deck of cards nigga, I dont deal with ya
I talk to the ghost of James Brown
It was a mans world then and its a mans world now
If you a fake nigga before, then you a fake nigga now
Nothing change, same song, same lyrics, same sound
Same shit different day, new problems every day
That revolver got that bang, that automaty just spray
Fuck games I dont play, unless its NBA 2K
Or that Madden, i ain't laughin, you reach for that cash then you next to pay
Thats just Jae, Jae don't think, Jae just go ham
Before you could blink, you go get a drink
She wink, next thing I know shes bent over my sink

[Lil Wayne - Verse 2]
Its Lil Tuenchi
I ain't on shit, I was born Wayne, wish I was born rich
Millz what it do, where them New York bitches
If these walls could talk, I hope they talk business
And I got my money right, and sense my money right
I can get some kidnappers to go kidnap your son and wife
I dont pack a gun or knife, I pack a checkbook
And I just point god, Russel Westbrook
On the real nigga, the clips got curves, thats sex appeal nigga
I'm extra ill, you pay the medical bill nigga
We masked up like there was a chemical spill nigga
Fuck with me e y e be damn if you will nigga
When we rolling we pop you like an extra pill nigga
Shoot to kill nigga, the truth will kill niggas
One time for harlem, two for Millz nigga, Tunechi

[Hook]
