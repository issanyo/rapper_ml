Young Money
Ain't nobody better, I ain't gotta tell ya, I can show you better, but why (why)
Ain't Nobody better, I ain't gotta tell ya, I can show you better but you (you)
You already know
You already know
Don't act like we don't glow (glow)
You already know yeah (yeah)

[Gudda Gudda]
You already know I hold it down like a ship anchor
VS1 diamonds while my wrist dangles
Chris Angel I can do magic with the coupe roof
Push one button or two and watch the roof, poof
Brown leather yoo-hoo Gudds rockstar like U-2
Red paint banging like Soo-Woo (huh)
It's a new day, Young Money crew day
Got these hoes in line like they waiting on them new J's
Who say, Gudda ain't the sickest nigga walking?
I'm spitting like a (?) turn the booth into a coffin
Could let you know that we much better than so and so
But I ain't got to name drop because you already know it though

[Mack Maine]
Miley Cyrus still ain't pop me off, so woadie stop askin me
But if you see her, ya heard me, tell her it's time to bring that ass to me
Real nigga academy, who trynna take flight?
What you make for year salary, we make in one night
I ain't bragging, I ain't boasting it's the signs of success
The fruits of my labor, mind over stress
Testimony to the best, the good probably hate it
But take the proper steps and you could be my neighbor
Fresh out of labor, it's Young Money baby
Even from the passenger side we drive these broads crazy
We ain't stopping, we ain't finished 'til my name up in the guinness
Stunna we made it, Tune we made it, we outlasting them limits
Homie, numbers don't lie, so you should check the charts
And I ain't a Simpson, my momma never slept with Bart
Man we shop when we land, we don't pack when we go
Since life is like a movie you better act like you know

[Jae Millz]
We don't talk to po-po
You already know doe
Yeah, I heard you was getting money but you told doe
Where I’m from that’s a no-no and I’m solid ‘til I go doe
Bad Chick with me and she only shop in Soho
Bad Chick with me and she gives me head in slowmo'
New York City nigga, Yankee fitted sitting low doe
When I was broke, I couldn't get niggas to see the four door
Now I'm getting money and they all knew I would blow doe
Yeah fucking right, we ain't fucking tight
It's just me and all of my dogs
No time for them bitch niggas, no time for them frauds
No time for them haters, no time if it ain't about paper
My Cup full and my team good and I'm screaming "nigga we made it"
Look, ain't nobody better but I ain't gotta tell you
I can show you better, ask your girl I get her wetter
Play with mine and them skimasks gon' come out with them berettas
Check the score, bitch we in the lead forever Millz
