[Intro]
Millzy!
Rest in peace to the great (Show off time)
He was born in Harlem (Show off time)
And so was I (So it's only right I put on)

[Pre-Hook]
On my grind, yeah, I stay on that
Tryna get this money till the day I die, how a nigga gon' hate on that?
Pull up with a girl from a part of the world your ass can't even find on the map
I put on for my city, for my team, for my family and most definitely for them stacks
You see me in this bitch

[Hook]
My watch is dancin', call me Sammy, Sammy Davis Jr
My chain dancin', call me Sammy, Sammy Davis Jr
All my diamonds dancin', dancin', dancin', Sammy Davis Jr
Puttin' on a show in this bitch like I'm Sammy, Sammy Davis Jr

[Verse 1]
All of my niggas winning, I don't roll with losers
If you hear I fucked your bitch, you could believe the rumors
Big ass chain, putting on a show like Sammy Davis Jr
Leave the club with yo' bitch when I'm done I drop her off to ya
All that hating, I laugh at
City on my back like a knapsack
Fly New York nigga till the day I'm gone
I get my Sammy on, no Rat Pack
No Frank Sinatra, no Dean Martin
My watch shining, my rings sparklin'
We blowing potent, lighting up the garden
You acting up then my team will park him (Blaow!)
Hand tall with that product, cop it and I move it
Her ass amazing, it look like she did something to it
Make me wanna do something to it
Drop top and the fur, bitch, I'm fuckin' foolish!

[Pre-Hook]
On my grind, yeah, I stay on that
Tryna get this money till the day I die, how a nigga gon' hate on that?
Pull up with a girl from a part of the world your ass can't even find on the map
I put on for my city, for my team, for my family and most definitely for them stacks
You see me in this bitch

[Hook]
My watch is dancin', call me Sammy, Sammy Davis Jr
My chain dancin', call me Sammy, Sammy Davis Jr
All my diamonds dancin', dancin', dancin', Sammy Davis Jr
Puttin' on a show in this bitch like I'm Sammy, Sammy Davis Jr

[Verse 2]
All of my niggas living life, chasing figures
Man I swear, some of y'all niggas worse than bitches
Friend zoning, pillow talking, still never getting nada
And she just want me to bust it, bust it, pi√±ata
I be so fresh and so clean, I mean
My style is so fresh, I'm so mean
I step on the scene, step off with your ho
She stepped in my house then I stepped in her throat
So reckless I know, I'm reckless fo' sho'
My necklace hang low like it's 2004
Yeah, I switched up my flow, get a zip for the low
Then we smoke like a pan when it sit on the stove when it's on for too long
I been high for too long, I been way too long
These niggas been hatin' too long and tell them niggas hate on
And tell 'em put their hates off
These niggas out here saving hoes, no hard drive
That's amusement park pussy, we could all slide, nigga

[Pre-Hook]
On my grind, yeah, I stay on that
Tryna get this money till the day I die, how a nigga gon' hate on that?
Pull up with a girl from a part of the world your ass can't even find on the map
I put on for my city, for my team, for my family and most definitely for them stacks
You see me in this bitch

[Hook]
My watch is dancin', call me Sammy, Sammy Davis Jr
My chain dancin', call me Sammy, Sammy Davis Jr
All my diamonds dancin', dancin', dancin', Sammy Davis Jr
Puttin' on a show in this bitch like I'm Sammy, Sammy Davis Jr

[Outro]
Yeah, turn up (Sammy, Sammy Davis Jr.)
Turn up (Sammy, Sammy Davis Jr.)
Turn up (Sammy Davis Jr.)
Puttin' on a show in this bitch like I'm Sammy, Sammy Davis Jr
Millzy, New York City
Harlem to be exact
But New York overall all that
Puttin' on a show in this bitch like I'm Sammy, Sammy
