[Intro]
Ladies and gentlemen
I go by the name of Jae Millz
Just a kid from Harlem, New York City
That's it, it's really here

[Verse 1]
I'm a fatherless child in this world, livin', just chillin'
Spittin', this verse from my iPhone just written
My lyrics get more potent the older I'm gettin'
Young niggas like, "What can I give 'em?" I'm like, "Wisdom"
Ugh, not to mention some dope ass music
You can play when you're getting dressed (mean)
It's like I make theme music for getting fresh
Smoke medicated every day, fuck a cigarette
You would think I was Mike's son, I got all the Jords
Sneaker boxes galore, my closet having storage wars
Somebody tell A&E they could come record
I looked in the world's mirror and asked, "Who was the dopest you ever saw?"
And it said

[Verse 2]
I'm a fatherless child in this world livin', still chillin'
Still tryin' to remain sucker free and get this chicken
My new Sedan hard like MOP, pause
And it's still MOP, yeah, money over pigeons
Ain't no oil on my marble floors, baby, I ain't slippin'
I ain't Tyson and you damn sure ain't Givens
But my birthday in this year in Houston, I was double cup liftin'
Throbe on, that's disrespectful to the pimp' if I wasn't sippin'
That's just G shit, fuck a rap song
Ask Bun if you think I'm just putting words in rap form
My slime, Wayne, gave me a chance and a platform
Now my town hype 'cause a fool is what I act for
Yeah, Yankee fitted, low cut
Spent mo' money on my belt than the jeans they holdin' up
Left my ex down in the dust, I don't care how she holdin' up
She went from a beamer to a bus, so who's the real asshole?
