[Intro: Meechy Darko]
They talk about you when you doing good
Gon' talk about you when you doing bad
Guess what?
Let me see you talk when you're dead
They talk about you when you doing good
Gon' talk about you when you doing bad
Guess what?
Let me see you talk when you're dead

[Chorus: Meechy Darko]
I need a vacation!
Where you going? (My nigga, where you going?)
I just came off the road (off the road)
London, Paris, Tokyo world tour
I need a vacation!
Where you been? (My nigga, where you been?)
Australia to Kingston (blap blap)
But I still ain't make it to the motherland (Goddamn)

[Post-Chorus: Meechy Darko & DIA]
Pack your bags yourself
For your vacation in Hell
Don't feel the same to me (don't feel the same to me)
Don't need explaining to me (don't need explaining to me)
Know when I'm going OT (know when I'm going OT)
I don't got time for no sleep (I don't got time for no sleep)

[Verse 1: Erick Arc Ellliot]
Stand for something, get wild for something, get high for suffering
Even if you gotta die for something
Every day we lost searching for truth and can't balance the signs
And can't side with the youth, can't side with the blind
They singing to me, on the line of scrimmage
Dog, I don't even get it, humble from beginning
Whole season time we eatin', you know a nigga fiendin'
When his weed is per diem (you must be European)
So whatever your vice is, don't make it tarnish the price list
My halo growing brightly, no rap shit entice me
The on and off light switch, bitch
Focus on your own shit instead of being nosy
And know, the rap Moses
Orchestratin purpose partly cause I got focused
So is the cultural remarkable on the soul on to tour the globe
With his hands on a .44 but that ain't what I voted for

[Bridge: Meechy Darko]
Being honest like a superpower these days
Being yourself is like a superpower these days
Money and wealth is like a superpower these days
Fire 'pon yuh head top—lead shower these days
Being honest like a superpower these days
Being yourself is like a superpower these days
Money and wealth is like a superpower these days
Fire 'pon yuh head top—lead shower these days

[Verse 2: Zombie Juice]
Can't follow me, numero uno upon a galaxy, it's blasphemy
They talk about it, living all these fallacies
I got that cavarly, don't make me split up your anatomy
I get her sad or sappy cause they sabotage her artistry
Pardon me, you're boring me, my rhymes is like some sorcery
Gravity holdin me, gotta get my shit in order, B
There's more to me than what you see or choose to believe in
This world is backwards, we're still in shackles
Designed to be confused, they only use blacks
When describing negative views only show blacks
When they violent in their views
It's more than that, they replace the phones with they homes
Parents be gone, don't teach their kids right or wrong
Not to be confused with this, this, or that one
My swag won, bad since this Michael Jackson
Assassinated, all my heroes are in cages
It's modern slavin', no money or label could take 'em
My name out on the table, these dudes is fables
I spread my wings so I can fly, just like an angel
My soul in sync with the universe and I'ma teach it
Lacking substance, I hope you seek it
All these followers but no one leading, it's so deceiving
This ain't about the land of freedom, the richest lead 'em
Gender equality? What about human equality?
Loving is one, and the future's looking cloudy
So they poison the water, poison the mind, poison the heart
Take all the land and rip it apart
Racism's still alive, they just be concealing it
Shout out to Kane, and all my niggas in the bin
And so it seems, gotta lead the youth to reach they dreams
No disrespect, it's like a generation disconnect
Logging in, all I see is hate up on the internet
Where's the love? They're scared of love, I always gotta give it back

[Chorus: Meechy Darko]
I need a vacation!
Where you going? (My nigga, where you going?)
I just came off the road (off the road)
London, Paris, Tokyo world tour
I need a vacation!
Where you been? (My nigga, where you been?)
Australia to Kingston (blap blap)
But I still ain't make it to the motherland (Goddamn)

[Post-Chorus: Meechy Darko & DIA]
Pack your bags yourself
For your vacation in Hell
Don't feel the same to me (don't feel the same to me)
Don't need explaining to me (don't need explaining to me)
Know when I'm going OT (know when I'm going OT)
I don't got time for no sleep (I don't got time for no sleep)
