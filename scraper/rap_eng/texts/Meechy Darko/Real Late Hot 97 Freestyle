[Intro]

[Zombie Juice]
Bad bitches and Hennessy
Bad bitches and hella weed
Top flight
Smoking all night
Thinking to myself what a motherfucking life
Drugs, hugs, daps, love, slugs, murder, blood-clots
Morbid, homicidal gore shit
Feeling kinda nauseous
Leave you dripping like a faucet or
Bloody abortion Abu Ghraib
Hood on the face
Spray at your waist
What a waste
Shitty, feces, like my fuckin ?
Yeah my bitch bad stretch that coochi like a slinky
Coogi or the fur, serve rims like d'oeuvres
Finger itchin
Steady trippin in the kitchen
Psychedelic mushrooms
I'm on another mission
Miss me with that bitchin'
No pot to piss in
And they say we ain't hip-hop
Raised by Big Pop and 2Pac
Get your shit rocked
Smoke you like my pipe do
Ignite the flame (Lighter Sound)

[Erick Arc Elliot]
If greatness was a woman this would be the song I'd give her
Ever since a seed I promoted myself
Me and my niggas
The difference between anonymous and the violence we bring
Only deter the minor acknowledge us all as kings
I fight with my own discretion
Only if he pull that weapon
I fought for my own perception
Godly in all forms
You see me, you see me wrong
You see Cesar Millan my dog
My nigga, the realest, the raw
The river the pain deliver the rain for you
Tat on my arm
Not in the literal sense but nigga my word is bond
Choice is to be that man once his steak is on the plate
Deliver it all ?
Uh
Underdog from the terror of God
Pick apart the elements and put together my song
My heart is heavy kid I never thought id ever belong
But I was wrong, Architect is everything that you on

[Meechy Darko]
Money can't buy happiness? Dummy it is happiness
Trap house, got work in them kitchen cabinets
Weed in them tablets, codeine and aspirin
Basking in the ambiance while I'm on the Ambien
Klonopins, gold mouth Meechy, million dollar grin
Mescaline, psychedelic, felon with the sentencing
For beating up the beat, and his tongue be his weaponry
Good brain'll blow a nigga's brain, J.F. Kennedy
Mind frame on the damn back seat of his Bentley
I'm hard to tame, that's why I'm in leopard print everything
You ain't 'bout that life, so it's best you never try, dog
I ain't scared of death, that's cause I already died, dog
Blood still wet, cut the check and count them pies, dog
Freaky bitch with me, man - she'll probably lick my eyeballs
Man she'll probably lick my eyeballs, man she'll probably lick my eyeballs

[Zombie Juice]
I’m real silly with it, real witty with it
Grab the titty watch it wiky wiky
Got my spliffy, I been a Benz punamy
Your pussy ?, it’s on to the next
Live from the underground, peep the sound
Wild motherfucker, golden smile
Tryna stay level headed, hold shit down
Walk around, no crown, champion bound
Flatbush raised me, the drug game paid me
Yo bitch I’m blazin and smoking in the same speak
Buss up in her mouth piece, nigga there, no seeds
Beast Coast, we been here, permanent ink flow
Got the choppers, pop yo partners, fill em up like empanadas
Young man, any given day could be yo last
Elevate yo mind, intertwine visions from the sky
Zombies never die, we multiply

[Erick Arc Elliot]
Told you, multiply

Told her don’t be shy, multiply light the chronic
Shawty left my fingers sticky like the onyx
I am automatic, trigger happy, I am nigga
Nappy, nigga savvy so you rappers don’t harass me
I would rather you just pass me by
Pharcyde, that-a-way, fuck what niggas gotta say?
I know I kept you waitin, articulatin my gamma ray
Brain storm, 8 arms, lead this generation
New school, I’m elevate on, help with nathon nigga
Fall like dominoes and somehow the best to kill
The truth nobody knows
Common as the abyss, is it truth is it myth?
You got a fetish for humor? I fuck around with yo bitch
Telekinetic powers if the world was ours
I would seek the honest, I am off the island
All I see is money multiplying like a motherfucker
You’re a blood sucker, we known to hustle
Love to bust so uh
Why yo broad’s touchin the plain clothes don’t bother me no more
Got em all in the law, have you chit checking yo jaw
Nigga raw, I told you before we set it off
So of course is this confrontation then I'mma shrug it off

[Meechy Darko]
Uh, well I guess it’s my go
Aye, well I guess it’s our go

Every bar raise the bar, I perform holocaust
All aboard man, my cup done runnin forth
As I pour I make sure I give ya'll that rugged roar
I mention them drugs and whores, they’d crucify me for sure
But a cross on my back will not detour me
From the road to the riches and the diamonds
For surely, young black gaudy
Due to nature we naughty, the mysterious, far from imperial
Perfection be the minimal, grab my crotch and commit my moonwalk in the holy pyramids
LSD got my spider senses tinglin
Bomb ass weed got me higher than Corey light crashin in some buildings
Eyes low like Clint East when you’re filmin him
Coke and some rum, now she feelin me
Coke and she numb but she feelin it, big chief Meech
Smoking like a chimney, tab on my tongue deflecting negative energy
I think I figured out why they killed Pac, Big, and Kennedy
But I keep that on the down low like half of the industry
3 foreign chicks in my bed and they tend to me
Under the sheets it’s more legs than the centipede
And my penis the centerpiece
Fuck You mean bitch I been the beast
Beast, what’s beast?
One finger can sweep the streets
And this beast live in the east and you feast, opposite don’t leak
My flow is very unique, my hair is crazy as me
FU, NYC, we hold it down for you

That ain't rhyme, Zombie
But I’m a rhymer, Zombie
That ain’t rhyme but I’m a rhymer

[Zombie Juice]
Fresh out the grave, bloody money, money great
Bong rips, 4 AM, feelin born again
Look at him, I look at I, as I drop 3 times
Two more drops on each eye, feellin like I can fly
No R Kells but I don’t mind, she’s 17, she get the pipe
I’m Marshall Mathers, I’m Randy Savage and I beat the coochi, call it gymnastics
My song tragic, my flow hazard
Them girls love the cocky like they love the molly
Kill em all kamikaze, C4 strapped to my body
Pow!
