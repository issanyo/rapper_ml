[Pre-hook: Meechy Darko]
It ain't sinnin' if you winnin'
I want anarchy at shows
I want bitches showin' titties
I want blood and broken bones
Trippin' off that chemical
LSD you better know
This is just a steppin' stone
Mosh pits and heavy smoke

[Hook x2]
Mosh pits heavy smoke
Mosh, mosh, mosh
Mosh pits heavy smoke
Mosh, mosh, mosh

[Verse 1: Issa Gold]
Let's go
Sarge Au, shooting star blue moon
Young red god reppin' that coast
We comin' up, the opposition fucked
Get em' to the morgue they gon' croak
I hate when a nigga ain't wit' it
Come stand front stage at one of our shows
Better get back before you get attacked by the pack of the wolves
My immaculate souls
In with the mosh pit you better clear space
Fuck with the gods we live up the place
Music entrancing your chromosome flame
We're lighting the way, cause an eternal change
Chemical balance, mix acid with dank
OG only blow potent on the stage
Money in the bank but my soul’s in the safe
Make a toast to the God, lighters up for the King, bitch

[Verse 2: Meechy Darko]
Never slipped but i tripped already
If i'm fucking her she sucked dick already
Wild boy ain't shit you could tell me
Meechavelli, tattoos on belly
And i got a case of Old English with me
And i keep that fire stored when i roll with sticky
Clockwork Indigo, nigga we mobbin'
Fuck is your problem, go get your mosh in

[Verse 3: Erick Arc Elliot]
Know that i'm with it, i handle my business
I'm moshing with niggas that hold up my image
I mosh with my killas, the beast coast offenders
The spliff got me gone at the least til November
The indigo union, the movement is now
Them clockwork individuale
That's Issa, Arc, and Meech the dark
Juice got the heart, AK'll spark that

[Verse 4: Meechy Darko]
Now hold up, hold up, you don't do drugs?
(You used that line before!)
Bitch so what?
Igniting my spliff, let's fight in the pit
I walk on the crowd like i'm christ in this bitch
Bounce, bounce, come on, bounce
Anybody in the crowd with an half an ounce
I got LSD, shrooms, DMT
Too you don't smoke weed, cool more for me

[Verse 5: AK]
Been a 1000 days since i been sober
But my karma so clean i dont need no love
Puff trees and act up, and throw them hands up
Elevated clan stay lifted on mad skunk
If you got asthma to the wall like plasma
Cause we don't give a fuck you and your ass get crushed
Clockwork anthem, just mosh and have fun
Come out and see the gang
You better bring your love

[Verse 6: Juice]
Nigga who that, Juicy come through
Clockwork clique shit, yeah this ain't the pope
Glock’s work, clockwork
Yes i slit your throat
Bars wicked like government officials with pistols
Itching with a Beretta to get ya
Shoot you, then get off, they miss you
The world is twisted so fuck the rules
My mind constricted with mushrooms
Clockwork bitch, this us dude
Bloody, gory, niggas ain't worthy
Smoke up, I started, I'm rolling again
The surgic I’m twisting done struck up a fiend
Nickname Black Jesus, I'm born to win
You gon' learn today
My niggas ball to win
Sweat drip-drip off the microphone
Zombie baked bitch, Juicy be off
