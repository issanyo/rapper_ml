[Verse 1: Erick Arc Elliot]
At 17 I told myself that I would lead a worthy life
Good cut, clean shirt, always been the nerdy type
Women never cared to think, that is what I later found
I just like what shorty likes so most of them just played around
So I smoke up the Kushy, & I don’t like a rookie
I’m calling all the shots and cats are just calling you
So I'm dreaming of several stacks
Hold up in the front when the days go back
Mom in the slum when the bank on that, go tit tit tit for tat
Acting for the roll of the part
And I’m just opposed to the narcs
So mines in the wood, yours in the park
Mines in the light, yours in the dark
Wait till my mind got older, sober from this liquor drinking heavy
I lived the college life we partied, busting, smoking plenty
So when the bowl is empty notify the reefer man
I smoked the green so when we lift we call it Peter Pan
So stop the lying, slime, I just have my mind aligned
You just chasing stupid broads and I’m just chasing dollar signs

[Hook: M.I.A.]
Liquid washed down my throat like soap, yeah
I don’t wanna think about the shit that’s warped
But I don’t wanna be deep on this beat
And I can’t fucking let go of whats around me

[Verse 2: Meechy Darko]
Everyday gets worse in this fucking universe
Just tryna paint the perfect picture before my child's birth
The show starts, I’m the man behind the curtain
The truth shall reveal itself if one thing is for certain
I’m known to beat the pussy till it’s squirtin'
They suck me off, I got a team of brain surgeons
Already know the blunt is rolled, the charm easer
Put it on God, no facade, I beyond freak-ha
I’m sinking in her ocean like an anchor
She’s shallow, so into myself I try to fuck my own shadow
I know that’s vain, liquor and weed, that ease the pain
So obsessed with Mary Jane no cells left up in my brain
Married to the game, 'bout to jump over the broom
Purple Haze and these shrooms now we sexin' on the moon
We don’t do the planes, nah we on spaceships
Her sex electric pussy tighter than a face lift
Look down, see nothing but grey skies
Living the high life, that is why they hate I
Remember days we use to kiss like the French do
Think about your pussy while I rape these instrumentals

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Juice]
First things first, I’m coming for ya neck, kid
Second off, super high, no question
3 L's rolled, kush be my best friend
Plenty women on they knees call me Jesus
Dope man flow, four O’s just to smoke
It’s just me, no gimmicks, real pimping
Straight shittin', what you see is what you getting
I’m 'bout to, I’m 'bout to play with ya kitty kitten
I admire her, so many ways
Whether it’s the breakdown or the cutting flower stage
Whether it’s to bagin, I made G’s off this haze
4 gram blunts keep you high up into space
Lace it with the PCP then passed it with a straight face
Someone pass the juice and gin, hoes getting loose in here
Shawty with the stupid chin, head game stupid in
Now do my whole crew in here, that’s how we do it here
I'mma find another you, that’s word to who
Never stress her, nah, I just undress her, uh
First base, light the blunt while I’m getting brain
Second base, peel off, now I’m switching lanes
Word from the wise, Juicy beat the pussy right
Word from the wise, Juicy beat the pussy right

[Outro: M.I.A.]
Left side is my right side
If its vice versa I’m still the same side
If my left side is my right side
If its vice versa I’m still the same side
Stay until it gets better
I never trust a letter
When it don’t write, don’t matter
I just got a knew one
