[Verse 1: Meechy Darko]

I am living fact you are more in fiction
Imaginary players never make make it to the big screen
Made an oath not to compromise when I turned 16
Revving up my engine on the road to riches and bling bling
Dropped out of high school that wasn't my thing thing
Signed up for fly school, now I spread the big wings
Spitting crack rock like my tongue live in the kitchen
You don't want meet the smiff'n two shots and I won't miss 'em
Got blood soaked in clothes soul get to liftin' speaking of liftin'
Let me get back to this spliffin'
Get to writing this crazy
Vivid shit I be dishin'
My voice hyp-notized I am stephen king vivid
Flick-flick hit it sour deez' in my spli-dif
Time shi-dif psilocybin fresh as my mind
LSD in my spine in due time I will be
One of the illest niggas to rhyme
Get up on your grind

[Verse 2: Erick Arc Elliott]
I say I'm high when I'm riding
Ceilings be dividing
Try him, bust like the affective [?]
