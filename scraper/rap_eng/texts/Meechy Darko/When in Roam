[Verse 1: Meech]
Gold mouth, street grammar
My big dick in these petite standards
No stash box so our hammers in hampers
Fuck the police, I can't goddamn stand 'em
Blunt after blunt, now my eyes satanic
You false like a Muslim eating a ham sandwich
While fucking a white chick in the ass now that’s ass backwards
I'm always coughing like a asthmatic
All because of my bad habits
Tye-dye, OG, heavy jeans, cannabis stench on my fabric
Shotty so big gotta stash it in hammer’s pantsin
Shots at yo toes leave them foes hammer dancing
Get it? Hammer dancing
And Addie got these bitches asking me where the acid be
Actually it's right here
Drop drop on yo tongue take a trip my dear
No fear you're a god so God is here
For you I shed these ultraviolet tears
Fibonacci in botany, we want giants like Jeremy Shockey
Now we just breed on and breed on a nation of peons
That don't know that we've been here for eons and eons
The world is a smorgasbord I'm tryna get my eat on
Feast on, money knots of rotten flesh
Ain't nobody topping this, Zombies we the mafia
If it's a dark night, Darko runnin' Metropolis
Mufucka ain't it obvious
This is far from perfection
Late teens I suffered from depression
It wasn't the physical or in love my reflection
Was more like metaphysical, must've been Satan's hands
And some say hip hop's a dead end, I bulldoze that dead end
Created a intersection, Jigga pass me the rock
I promise no interception
I know you like "them drugs is fogging up his perception"
Teflon for Christmas, I don't need another dead friend
Seriously, man Mary Jane my lover and my best friend
And I thank her everyday for her blessings
Seriously, Mary Jane my lover and my best friend
And I thank her for her blessings

[Hook: Meech]
Hail Mary, uh, Hail Mary
Blow yo smoke in the sky, Hail Mary
Hail Mary, Hail Mary
Blow the smoke in the sky, Hail Mary

[Verse 2: Erick]
World event, war, and then water
I witnessed a reporter save a wealthy man's daughter
Only see the high in me, indulging in sobriety
Of course I drink good but weed give me some variety
I reminisce living, never took a life
But sometimes I think different and I contemplate killing
No rosary to clutch, no hoes for me to touch
If pussy my religion then I pray before I cut
Insecure, immature, gradually I'm at a loss
I'm just buying time and I ain't never cared the cost
Popping some excedrin, headaches turn to armageddon
If ya acting like a girl, can't be a woman at my wedding
So I pray you understand, as righteous as I am
If Brenda's got a baby, raise my son up like a man
Son of Sam with a 44 caliber
Killing modern slaves, spread AIDS out in Africa
They reduce pay, still a way for drug trafficking
Made it clear like it's sitting in the packaging
Times I wouldn't rap cause I was wack
There was I time I gave it back, afar away from that
That shit is really wack, feeling so depressed yo
Will it give me will or will it give me death row
Life full of stress nigga but I never stress though
A simple word of mouth, never mouth what you hear when you hear G's
Get that top blown at in air breeze
Shorty on the line coked out, can you hear me?
Since you're unaware I'm a rare breed
This is real nigga shit, honey don't compare me
Life of a king and bleed life through poetic psalm
You ain't gotta be Taliban to blow a bomb, what is going on?
Marvin Gaye is today, ignorance is tomorrow
Sing sorrow and the whole world'll follow

[Hook]
