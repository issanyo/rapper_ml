[Intro: Meechy Darko]
Acid, acid—tab, tab
Roll it, smoke it—take a drag, drag
Acid, acid—tab, tab
Roll it, smoke it—take a drag, drag
Acid, acid—tab, tab
Roll it, smoke it—take a drag, drag
Acid, acid—tab, tab
Roll it, smoke it—take a drag, drag

[Verse 1: Erick Arc Elliott]
Ain't no heart in the music, it's all device
In the lab cooking work like Walter White
My general salute, I got a gram or two
And have a nigga head spinning like a poltergeist
Probably never gon' change, nigga, fuck fame
This is real cocaine, nigga, nigga numb to the gums
Nut, numb 'til you spit
Nothing I ever do is wack, so in fact, I am that sick (Ill)
Nigga, hit it once then he pass it (Still)
Casket, casket, I am often drastic
Undead to the dead, two horns on my head
Levitating when my eyes become red, dawg
Nectar for the holy protector, wreck them
Yes, I carry a long weapon, just in case
Machine gun them, we clear the place
True Jah love, ganja we blaze

[Chorus: Meechy Darko]
Don't do drugs, kids—give 'em to I
It's amazing how acid could open your eyes
My face look sour 'cause I'm smokin' it, guy
I'm so damn high, can't open my eyes
Don't do drugs, kids—give 'em to I
It's amazing how acid could open your eyes
My face look sour 'cause I'm smokin' it, guy
I'm so damn high, can't open my eyes

[Verse 2: Meechy Darko + Erick Arc Elliott]
You the best, nuh-uh, I'm the best, bruh bruh
Shotgun, pump pump, leave you leaking, slump slump
Now you all fucked up, don't compare us to nobody, nigga, they're not us
Had to die for these children, fuck the music is my grudge
O.G. I puff, gold teeth, not much if (Not at all)
Told her I don't give a fuck unless the money's involved
Or drugs involved, or fucks involved
Baby, a dollar and a dream'll make your money evolve
Like watered-down packs, you're not that raw
These Bolivian bars that I'm stepped on
Hear thy weapon, fear thy Weapon
Nigga, you slipping if ain't near thy weapon
Supreme seams, Zombie logo
Or I'm wearing polo, eye bleed, hit trees, meet Sonny Bono
Between these seas and I row row row row
Radiant girl can't see my aura
I'm Meechy, I needs me a Rita Ora
Lock your daughters, I'm coming for her
I knock that bitch up and I not support her, I'm joking, sorta
You know my future's bright and I'm kinda important
I don't need the karma, drama, baby momma
Unless she bout dollars she spray the llama
When doubt I got problems, I spit death, roll, and drown in a coffin
The world's on my back and it's quite exhausting
But I'ma keep squeezing it for all this fortune, I'm off this
