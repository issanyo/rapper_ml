[Hook: Black Dave]
Little bit mo' of the cash
Little bit mo' of the hash
Little bit mo' of the rubber-band popping and smacking that all on the ass
Little bit mo' on my swag
Little bit mo' of the crew
Little bit mo' of the realest niggas kicking it like Ryu
Little bit mo' of these fools, thinking like what they gon' do
Minimum flow with the minimum dough, these niggas ain't making no moves
Thinking about gripping the tool, but what the fuck is you gon' prove
This shit is a joke, niggas get smoked, just take a per step in my shoes

[Verse 1: Black Dave]
Just take a per step in these Vans, these niggas must not understand
I'll pay my tuition, my life is a mission, just telling you that's who I am
My mic Pakistan I will blam
Turning it up at the shows, leaving with all of the dough
But still have room for your ho, thinking she wonderful too
Leave herself a little picture
Lights, camera, flash, this bitch gon' make me her mister
Come get 'cha, then split 'cha
That's a warning, you a victim
Pussy mourning cause I killed it
Early morning with a silk bitch
For the thrill of it, need a 2 liter of the purp so a nigga can't feel shit
Real motherfuckers 'round me, that's who I deal's with
Making my city proud, everybody gon' feel this
We the realest, take a step in these shoes you can't heel this
Flatbush ridin', Black Dave grindin'
Tell these lame niggas ain't ever no problems
Smoking violent, eyes be blinding
Floating on earth, get high like a pilot
Chasing dollars, never chase nonsense
Throw a couple bills might change the comment


[Hook: Black Dave]

[Verse 2: Meechy Darko]
Little bit mo' in my cup
LSD drops and I can't get enough
Never will I detox, I'm the best thee not
Go ahead and send shots nigga I eat shots
I'm a zombie that mean I'm a flesh rot
You ain't heard? We the motherfucking best stop
My bitch bad, her hair long, her hands down to her chest out
She sitting pretty, I'm sitting greedy
Blunt after blunt, cunt after cunt
I say it with a black girls heart
If you want psychedelic renegade, let them all go front
Thats why they call me Darko
Cause I'm dark ho, I got a light ho, got a dark ho
I wet they tulips with my dark hose
Get it? Two lips, dark hose
Rapping is a art, nigga and I am Van Gogh
I miss the signs, she loves seeing the samples
She want a ? nigga Manzel
80's baby, I emerged to the crack smoke
It took crack to crack us black folk
Super loud pack in the back of the 'ac, we call that mystical
Flatbush Zombies body rottened, got the world on my genital
