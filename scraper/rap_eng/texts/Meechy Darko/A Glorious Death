[Part I]

[Intro: A$AP Twelvyy]
Blrrt, blrrt!
It's a bird, it's a plane

[Verse 1: Meechy Darko]
New phone, who dis? New day, new bitch
Rang rang, there go my celly, tattoos like Makaveli
Acid trip, this bitch I'm with might overdose like Anna Smith
Crip or Blood, 50/50 love, my nigga died for this handkercheif
ZOMBiE gang, A$AP, I eat the beat and beat three
From CD to tape deck, LSD, some shroom tea
Two groupies and safe sex, threesome, AM
Amen, hallelujah, hollow clipped it, hollows through ya
Backwood smoking, Goyard gun holster, Gucci sofas
Heard you was sending shots, I was too high to notice
Marijuana, I'm smokin' potent, my eyes are glowin'
My pistol loaded, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, now you knowin'

[Verse 2: ZOMBiE Juice]
Top of the buildin' and I got a feelin'
Sudden rush to the brain, so obnoxious the feelin'
Loyalty to the drugs, feelin' so high high, nigga what?
Rolling with the clique, middle fingers up
Police on my dick, never gave a fuck
Always living trife, bitch you down to fuck?
Smoking on some shit that your mama off
Never pretend, I gotta go get it this one is all
War love got me, but since all
Talkin' 'bout some money, we gon' get it solved
Talkin' 'bout some bud, we gon' smoke it all
LSD bitch, I'm off the wall
Throw your hands up if you wanna roll
On some new shit, baby this a new phone
Got some new packs in and some quick dough
Same nigga dead niggas, 10-4
Rest in peace to my nigga nigga, Yambo

[Bridge: A$AP Twelvyy]
Live long, long live, yeah I live long
Lance Armstrong, live strong, yeah, did right and I did wrong
Okay, get high so I hit bone

[Beat Switch]

[Verse 3: A$AP Twelvyy]
Yeah, yeah, yeah
I'm an activist, I cook crack with a dab of piff
Crystal meth on an acid trip
I'm a G in coke, from trees to dope
I feed my coast, hit my line if you need a quote
It's a secret show, only speak it if you need to know
And you niggas, I don't need to know
Beat the beat 'til the speaker broke, I'm in the streets puffin' reefer smoke
Try to creep, let the Eagle go
Man I'm down for the drillin' of course
Man you sugarcane niggas is soft, don't respect your jaw
Man matter of fact, fuck the law
Double up, nigga, fuck the court, been on it like an outlaw
Batman vigilante goin' southpaw
Might head to Miami for some time off
Came back to the city, hit the concourse
Man I'm livin' like a mob boss

[Verse 4: Erick Arc Elliott]
I shake the game, refrain from permanent
My style compares rare like fiends that serve a nick
My goals can touch souls, my niggas impervious
My team go buck wild, sip Hen and smoke spliffs
Don't think I won't trip, cherish every moment
A nigga won't miss if he's very focused
All black, funeral, gettin' down with a bad one
Used to smoke two grams now I'm smokin' mad blunts
Had extendo, niggas cause they basic
Minds need replacement, thoughtless, conscious and tasteless
Ring a bell cause the aliens comin' down
If you say that shit is myth my experience was wild
Man could run a mile while his legs are broken down
But Arc cook it up, tell shorty simmer down
It's amazin', how you niggas really feel about it
When it's top floor, ain't no room for more when it's crowded, muh'fucka
