[Verse 1: Meechy Darko]
Money can't buy happiness, dummy, it is happiness
Trap house, got work in them kitchen cabinets
Weed and them tablets, codeine and aspirin
Basking in the ambience while I'm on the Ambien
Klonopins, gold mouth Meechy, million dollar grin
Mescaline, psychedelic, failing with the sentencing
For beating up the beat, and his tongue be his weaponry
Good aim, I'll blow a nigga brain, J.F. Kennedy
Mind frame on the damn backseat of his Bentley
I'm hard to tame, that's why I'm in leopard print everything
You ain't 'bout that life, so it's best you never try, dawg
I ain't scared of death, that's cause I already died, dawg
Blood still wet, cut the check and count them pies, dawg
Motherfuck the Feds, dirty money we divide, dawg
Blood still wet, cut the check and count them pies, dawg
Freaky bitch with me, man - she'll probably lick my eyeballs

[Hook]
Inf beams - you know, guns with the lazers
Couldn't afford a silencer, so we use a potato
Inf beams - you know, guns with the lazers
Couldn't afford a silencer, so we use a potato
Inf beams - you know, guns with the lazers
Couldn't afford a silencer, so we use a potato
Inf beams - you know, guns with the lazers
Couldn't afford a silencer, so we use a potato

[Verse 2: Zombie Juice]
Smoking GDP, mixed with some Chocolope
Hash in the bowl, that super-duper stinky flow
Juicy be the name, gettin' brain, that's a zombie fault
Flatbush nigga, walking dead, that's a killer flow
Smith & Wesson, catching wreck in your confession
Want the safe, and the stash, and the ma'fucking weapons
Too much Hen, now Juice is going in
Off tops, fuck cops, we hot, you not, that's why they honoring
I've only been around for a second, but I'm killing it
No rest for the wicked, niggas stay lifted, high-class livin'
Put the biscuit straight to your bitch lips
She gone kiss it, I am pimping
My .44's my bulldog - my dog shoots niggas' ears off
My full mask and my AK - tear a nigga out his Chevrolet
My terrier's my .22, just for the litle-ass bitch in you
Two shots for my niggas on the block
Said he feelin' myself, and I ain't gotta see 'em hot
Outlaw, bumping 2Pac, outlaw, bumping 2Pac

[Outro]
I am the one to follow, I am the role model
All my tips is hollow, all my clips extended
All my whips is polished, all my teeth is gold
All my bitches models
All in all I'm all for the onslaught of all of y'all
So all aboard everyone
Awful that I must perform a Holocaust
And offer off the souls of those to get a simple point across
A cross cannot deport ya from the torture or this scorcher
You will not refuse this offer
Sign the dotted line with blood, you will not refuse this offer
Sign the dotted line with blood, you will not refuse this offer
