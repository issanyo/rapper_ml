[Verse]
I'm so high from last night, woke up on the ceiling, yo
Bucket low like fuck it though, nigga feel like Gilligan
Fuck being better than you, I'm tryna be better than me
It's just me, myself, and I, I'm tryna be better than we
Roll that weed, no stress we need
Smoking 'til we catch a seizure, Rick Ross indeed
The XO got me staggering like I ain't got no balance, and
My bitch head great and yours mentally challenged
Three bitches and me, ha, now that's some foreplay
Sex sweet, sticky sheets, pussy tastes like shortcake
Grandaddy OG kush and Olde English
Can't tell me that my soul ain't old, nigga
My money bloody so she call me Count Rackula
Endzone dance in the pussy, then I tackle her
No, I never shackle her tear the condom wrapper up
My dick is a gift so I wrap it up
Beat the kitty nine times, now all her life gone
This is my retarded flow, call it fifty Tyson
Putting this dick in this pussy, constrict like a python
This weed is quite strong, I stuff it and ignite bong
Inhale, exhale, take a whiff, I bet you smell me
Pissy off the crissy I'm pissing on bitties like R. Kelly
I'm young, black, and gaudy, young, black, and horny
She young, black, stacked, ass fat, face gorgeous
Never ask for shit and her ego is enormous
Remember, she's a bitch, so of course a nigga dog her
Safari-print lenses, I murdered the beat
Dissect it and do forensics and leave without a blemish
Smoking on headband, overviewing the earth
Life is a fifty-fifty, you know, gift and the curse
How deep is too deep, cause I done seen the bottom
Feels like the earth is in my reach because that's how high I've gotten
I dispose of you foes and these shows through the flows
Pop a tab and crush the globe as my third eye glows
It's hard to believe that there is barely a heart in me
Stepped in my mistake cause it only made a smarter me
Even blood know, cause flow like an artery
Even Cuz know, blood flow like an artery
