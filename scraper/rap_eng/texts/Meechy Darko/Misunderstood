[Verse 1: Erick Arc Elliott]
Selfish dream, self-esteem, self-destruction off the beams
Helpless beings sowing seeds to assert the solar fiends
Though it seems shit ain't panning out but it's on the screen
Know that means we are being deemed as a comedy

[Verse 2: Zombie Juice]
This is me, fuck you mean, living like I'm in a dream
Visualize it unity, divide it far as you can see
Diamonds bling while they bleed, fighting for our future seeds
Figure where you wanna be, choose a side and take the streets

[Hook: Nyck Caution]
I said misunderstood, I ain't afraid to say
Missing some screws above, don't feel okay today
I pour some liquor out, I mix the pain away
Truly I do mean well, it may not seem that way
I said misunderstood, I ain't afraid to say
Missing some screws above, don't feel okay today
I pour some liquor out, I mix the pain away
Truly I do mean well, it may not seem that way

[Verse 3: Erick Arc Elliott]
Is Archimedes mucho and greedy? It's what I'm pleadin', yes
Mischievous the true elite convenient, placing books where your TV is
Alleged genius proceed to flee with hits
I'm leaving this, a form of preemie fetus kid, I'm devious

[Verse 4: Zombie Juice]
Processed by the media, this ain't no Wikipedia
Foods lacking substance and people change for the greedier
Selfish and feeble weak minds blinded by ego and pride
Hope we can see with three eyes because we need to see why

[Hook: Nyck Caution]
I said misunderstood, I ain't afraid to say
Missing some screws above, don't feel okay today
I pour some liquor out, I mix the pain away
Truly I do mean well, it may not seem that way
I said misunderstood, I ain't afraid to say
Missing some screws above, don't feel okay today
I pour some liquor out, I mix the pain away
Truly I do mean well, it may not seem that way
