[Meechy Darko]
Say hello to Satan, once you cross the bridge
Screams turned to whispers, fighting in the mist
I do not belong here, I think they clipped my wings
Uncertain, unstable, do I even exist?
Now how can I fly away?
We’re born to die anyway
I’m getting high everyday
Will suicide end the pain?
