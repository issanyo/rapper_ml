[Intro: DIA]
Don't be anxious or impatient
Cause I, I wanna hold you close and never let go

[Bridge: Zombie Juice]
Yeah, she said, "Baby, don't go"
But you and I got to be for you and I
This that do or die, "Po Pimp" shit, recordin' in the 'Stuy
And I get so high that I forgot 'bout last night, right
Yeah, she said, "Baby, don't go"
But you and I got to be for you and I
This that do or die, "Po Pimp" shit, recordin' in the 'Stuy
And I get so high that I forgot 'bout last night, right

[Chorus: Erick Arc Elliott & (Zombie Juice)]
In a world (in a world) full of thieves (full of thieves)
We see diamonds (we see diamonds) we see keys (we see keys)
If the issue (if the issue) talk to me (talk to me)
If I miss you (If I miss you) it's cause you're deep (it's cause you're deep)
In a world (in a world) full of thieves (full of thieves)
We see diamonds (we see diamonds) we see keys (we see keys)
If the issue (if the issue) talk to me (talk to me)
If I miss you (If I miss you) it's cause you're deep (it's cause you're deep)

[Verse 1: Erick Arc Elliott]
Ooh, I say we struggle, it's hard livin', streets have been unforgivin'
Smoke weed, hold deep conversations with winners
'Cause these my brothers, love 'em to death
Written in stone, so when I'm gone, they 'uggin' our breath
Don't frequent Hell, Gorillaz pin on lapel
There's six grams in the blunt, on a mission to find myself
Growin' and breakin' ties, cryin' and savin' lives
Couldn't be discontent, temptation arrives

[Verse 2: Zombie Juice]
Yeah, I'm patiently waiting
But I don't really give a fuck if we ain't in your rotation
I put the heart up on this bitch and can't nobody take it
Brooklyn niggas, we take it, Flatbush baby, gon' make it
Check it, but these my brothers, love 'em to death
Written in stone, until I'm gone, we puffin' the death
No concern, nah, compare us, how?
Cool milli off the merch, SoundScan's shuttin' down now

[Verse 3: Erick Arc Elliott]
I put the bread down on something I wanted for years
If my brother need some money, man I prol'ly sell that shit, hey
Break it into pieces, ooh, wow; there it is
Brothers make real beats, bomb lyricist
Brothers look the other way, nothing come to trouble mate
This is why I love you dog, smokin' at your mama's crib
My brother not a local, my brother travel continents
No need to find a hotel, my brothers got the couch and shit

[Verse 4: Meechy Darko + sample]
Debra's only son, he was conceived in King's County
That was '89, by '92 he was already rowdy
Misunderstood since he crawled out the womb, the only child
And his momma workin' three jobs, one was dealin' with drama
'Cause I was wildin', he used to rarely see his father
They seperated, couldn't keep his dick in his pajamas
Because he was out there hustlin', tryin' to be a provider
Tryin' to turn a pretty penny into a million dollars
They tell you 'bout my family, that bipolar disorder
And due to karma, my first youngin’ gon’ be a daughter
When I was 5, I told my mom I wanted to die
Then we cry, the crazy shit, man, it wasn’t a lie
Man, this life, is filled with stress
So much oppressed, call New York City "9"
I sit alone and reflect, took me 28 years to realize that I'm blessed
Aunt Pam died from cancer; I quit them cigarettes
Weight of world on my shoulder—I just finished my reps
All addicted to drugs, we all addicted to sex
Feelin' so self-destructive, like I’m clingin' to death
Took my five-digit check and copped some bigger baguettes
Took a look at my ring, finger charm on my neck
Still in touch with myself, that flashy shit won't prevail
I really be shopping for happiness, but that shit ain't for sale
But if you don’t show ‘em then they won’t think you do it well
I heard that blood's thicker than them Atlanta strippers
But these my brothers, I ain't got real brothers to know the difference
And, Erick, if I could, I'd give your mama my kidney
'Cause she my momma, too, I promise you
I ride for my niggas, die for my niggas
Load .4-5 (Rah-rah!) pull homicide for my niggas
Word up, 'cause you my brothers, love 'em to death
Written in stone, I take my heart and rip it out my chest
To prove to you that it's Zombie Gang, rotten flesh
That's to the death, nigga—no more, nothing less
True, indeed, Juice, if you ever off or bleed
I'm takin' care of your seeds, even if that means millions in fees for custody
She wildin' out on court, I’m like, "Give that bitch what she needs."
("Order in the court!") Judge, please ("Order!")
I guess I still got alot to maturin' to do
I know we still got a whole lot of world tourin' to do
This game is supposed to be locked in, I leak through
Like a real bad pussy pad, watch me seep through
Ooh, it’s Darky, baby; a whole different hue
My grand-daddy got 8 balls; come and get a cue
I come from the struggle, motherfucker, get a clue
Headshot, red dot, now make a move

[Chorus: Erick Arc Elliott & (Zombie Juice)]
In a world (in a world) full of thieves (full of thieves)
We see diamonds (we see diamonds) we see keys (we see keys)
If the issue (if the issue) talk to me (talk to me)
If I miss you (If I miss you) it's cause you're deep (it's cause you're deep)
In a world (in a world) full of thieves (full of thieves)
We see diamonds (we see diamonds) we see keys (we see keys)
If the issue (if the issue) talk to me (talk to me)
If I miss you (If I miss you) it's cause you're deep (it's cause you're deep)
