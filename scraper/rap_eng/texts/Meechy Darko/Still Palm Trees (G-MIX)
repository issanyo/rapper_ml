[Intro: Snoop Dogg]
This is the G-Mix
Flatbush Zombies, Big Snoop Dogg
Palm Trees

[Verse 1: Meechy Darko]
Yeah still I palm trees in the calm breeze
Pardon me, Dogg, Meech
Only get my D if she sing R&B
My lyrics send shivers, no way you can't feel this
Got quadriplegics tappin' they feet, snappin' they fingers
My team gets higher than the voice of Weeknd
My chronic louder than what preachers and deacons be speaking (hallelujah)
Infinity stoned
My neck and teeth lit, glow like a beacon
I'm rollin' reefer
She fronto leafin', you know I'm chiefin'
Picture Meech not rollin' up
That's like Magic Johnson donatin' blood
Picture Meech not rollin' up
That's like Magic Johnson donatin' blood
She loves them rappers but only niggas like me
I love them bitches
I only eat that pussy if she's spiritual (yum yum)
Something in your blouse got me feelin' so aroused
Hittin' blunts til I'm knocking out
Wet Meowth for that cotton mouth

[Hook: Meechy Darko & Snoop Dogg]
So much grams, y'all blew my high the first time so I had to do it again
But still palm trees
So when you throw shade, nigga never harm me
It be Zombie Gang and the D-O-double G

[Verse 2: Zombie Juice]
Every day, me and Mary Jane
If you ain't talking terps well homie what you say
I be swimmin' in the clouds, so high I can't come down
With D-O-double G, A-R-C, and Meechie
Yeah so much grams, vacuum sealer in the hotel
So much ass I had to hit it in the hotel
Till 6 in the morn' like that R. Kelly song
Probably fucked your baby momma green with my ice on
See I'm on some new shit
They stole my swag, they can have it
But I'm on some magic shit
Jordan at the garden lit
Brooklyn made me this, Bronx Tale, I'm on some sunny shit
Flatbush screaming till I die, still they hate on the messiah
Medicate I'm on some other shit, my weed is just too fire
Flossin' just because I wanna, I can see that you despise
So I'm grindin' everyday tryna be the top five
And it's still palm trees everybody, let's get high

[Hook: Meechy Darko & Snoop Dogg]
So much grams, y'all blew my high the first time so I had to do it again
But still palm trees
So when you throw shade, nigga never harm me
It means Zombie Gang and the D-O-double G

[Verse 3: Erick Arc Elliot]
They still hating the genius
Zombies been taking over
This time we recruit the G-est
I'm known to smoke one up until we approach the zenith
If it's OG I steam it
Only promote the cleanest and the passenger too
Then I pass it to Snoop
Wrap away is too is to match it and
If you master this rule, lighters next time we in the cypher
I'll pass it to you
Passions for that in school
Smoking good like 222
Don't we say they shoot at you
Shout at my niggas, who were shadier in the views
I'm certified with the smoke, inhaling the dope fumes
Smellin' pack
Got offended like a groupie though
Listen to me, this the killer that'll make you lose it though
[?] in Cali, N.Y
Baby, baby, don't cry
Ain't no place we can't smoke [?]
This is the G-Mix baby
We out in Cali, N.Y
Baby, baby, don't cry
Ain't no place we can't smoke it, right, Snoop?
Worldwide

[Hook: Meechy Darko & Snoop Dogg]
So much grams, y'all blew my high the first time so I had to do it again
But still palm trees
So when you throw shade, nigga never harm me
It be Zombie Gang and the D-O-double G

[Outro: Snoop Dogg]
Recognize game when it's in your face
One thing about me and these trees
We have an unbreakable bond
We're connected from the roots to the seeds, to the leaves, to the trees
Feel me, please
We plan to disperse to the earth
What is it worth
Whether you're last, whether you're first
From the date of your birth
We smoke trees cause trees was delivered from the earth
Dig that
See a lot of y'all don't know
So said Snoop Dogg
Flatbush Zombies
Blaze one for the nation
