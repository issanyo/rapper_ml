[Verse 1: Bodega Bamz]
The Devil knockin' shit I heard it quite clear
I hug the block
No emotion, blank stares
When I started smokin' stoges in that staircase
Them joy rides cause I wanted that police chase
A friends love turn into an enemy's hate
I'm a predator, pray on both knees
My Rev don't run
Get Creflo Dollar
If the corner raised you
Well that's your father
I got one mother
She tried to cuff me to the radiator
Wild Juvenile gettin' paper
Fuck the Industry, I'm following the river to the mainstream
I don't want to be an Underground King
Why sell myself short? I'm 5'7"
Only stool pigeons talk, who you tellin'?
That's the bullshit we smellin'
Got a Tec 9, Mac 10 and 11
Who want what?

[Hook: Meechy Darko]
I am the highest nigga living
Although I ain't alive it is not suicide
If you already died
Flatbush Zombies Worlds Fair
Saying "Nigga we on the rise!"

[Verse 2: Prince SAMO]
Yo, yo
I got the eyes of Medusa so I dare a nigga stare at me
Bring your bitch I bet she got less hair than me
Bring your mans I bet he got less balls than me
Niggas don't want it b, and bitches taking all of me
The streets keep calling me
I'm trying not to answer
Tango with the Devil and I'm such a great dancer
Bookin' on the boys, still running from the scanner
Born in the ghetto still searchin' for the answers
Two 9's equals 34 bullets
Niggas down to hold it, most niggas scared to pull it
(Bumbaclot!) Nigga what the fuck you lying for?
Viceroys war, and I'm fighting for a higher cause
Kings blood, tainted by some dark liquor
Arroyo Road
Dawn with some Glocks nigga
Olde English in my goblet
4 gold fingers in my pocket
Facial features of a god kid
My Zombie niggas dead but the god is alive
I'm half Tanboy, but black on both sides
From Uptown to Brooklyn to Queens, where you coming?
Its that New New York, respect the second coming motherfucker

[Hook: Meechy Darko]
I am the highest nigga living
Although I ain't alive it is not suicide
If you already died
Flatbush Zombies, World's Fair
Saying "Nigga we on the rise!"

[Verse 3: Meechy Darko]
Watching my nigga Prince, morph into a king
Picture us running this city, draped in gold and leopard skin
Mentally I'm of another pedigree
I'm like Gandhi and Marcus Garvey
On methamphetamine's, mixed with a hint of everything
Equipped with weaponry, to deter any enemy
This chick named Destiny, skin color Nestle
Her head official tissue, she blow my whistle
Like referees now that's a shot caller
I take her on a trip to paradise
Then not call her
I ain't lion like a muthafuckin cub
Foams on my feet like I just stepped out the tub
Rubba dub roll a dub
Fuck a slut, I'm wassup, tattoos on my gut
Better let bygones be bygones
I'm a motherfuckin tyrant
A ti-ti-ticking time bomb
The best rapper alive is me
Dylan and dylan
?????? cook the base on the George Foreman
I cook mine using telekinesis, nigga that's godly
Grown up in misfortune
Born in the ghetto, god handed us the short end
That is not important
This environment got my soul torn, but
I smoke and i sore up
Cloud nine, my my my the view is gorgeous
Cloud nine, my my my the view is gorgeous

[Outro: Meechy Darko]
And these whores fucked
Zombie gang, Worlds Fair you know us
(Bitch) and if you don't, you better open your mother fucking head
Dumb motherfucker! And learn something bitch
Ass nigga (You don't know shit, you don't know shit)
Old piss ass bitch, old bitch ass bitch
Or whatever the fuck you is nigga (You a dumb ass nigga)
(Nigga x20)
"Iight man stop, if you won't stop I won't stop hahaha"
