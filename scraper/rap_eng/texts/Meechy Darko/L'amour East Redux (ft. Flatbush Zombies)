[Intro]
I'm not worried about it my self, you know, cause if they come to me, talking, I think Ima talk back, you know, I'm not gonna shut up for nobody, you know, nobody

[Verse 1: Meechy Darko]
I'm addicted to love, lust, knowledge, and euphoria
Drugs, C and D cups, ganja and the gorier
Blood, guts, and deep cuts, Everlands, and black Timbs
Gold mouth, leopard flag, click-clack, we strapped in
I roll up, talk shit, niggas know I'm really real, big blunt of that sour
Smoke it till I catch a chill, niggas get slain over basketball game, man, the hood may never change, all these niggas do is bang
Cops want us all in chains, chase us down the one way
I'm too, smooth in my ways, threw the stash in the drain
This twelve gauge, split a nigga, tsunami waves bitch
I beat you ass for some shades and some johnny cake shit (coo-coo)
Rip your face off your scalp, now you got a facelift
Beef, what's beef, that's a great dick shit, Feet? that's a great ditch
Zombie Gang, NYC, we amazing, fuck NYPD, man I hate them
I, I, I, I, I, I met the reaper once, he told me that I should keep it up
And if ever my gun I clutch, then he would help me sweep it up
I got Jesus on the payroll, and if he move left, then perfect
I'm smashing and fucking high low, that's the truth, nonfiction
150 proof my liquor, Zombie Gang, Ill Bill, my nigga

[Hook: ILL BILL]
Latin quarter to L'amour east, we all beast
From across seas to cross queens, we all creeps
We, we, we all, we, we, we all, we, we, we, we all creeps
CBGB to L'amour east, we all beasts
Smoke PCP, kids got stabbed over graffiti beef
Gra-gra-gra-gra-gra-graffiti beef
(look at me motherfucker when I'm talking)

[Verse 2: Zombie Juice]
Flatbush Sweater, queens get the money, sticking to the strip, ain't a damn thing funny, hoe
Stick to the strip, if you ain't getting money, from the land of the hoe, baking sodas, and the honey
Stick up kids, sparing nothing but the ribs
Hop in the bang, bang, bang, bang bang bang
Peel off quick, bumping track number 6, ready to die, I'm that Big
Can't teach a old dog new tricks, my old dog got the four fifth
And his fingers, they itch, finna smack a bitch, where's my lighter
Roll the weed, that might your [?], many individuals try to play the game, head first off your frame
Flawless victory, decapitate, and Micheal Jordan, he from Brooklyn too
Where niggas get killed for they Air Jordan shoes, I don't really ball, but I'm higher than you
Smoking fire with some dreads, calculating ways to clean the spread
Cop a paddy, then I head to the liquor store
Bomb, where's the hoes that be watching all my videos, we gone need a few of those
Zombie maneuver those, when I was young I used to bump that mace shit
[?] too, brown Timbs and a razor, now I'm fiction, beat a nigga pulp, no kidding

[Hook]
Latin quarter to L'amour east, we all beast
From across seas to cross queens, we all creeps
We, we, we all, we, we, we all, we, we, we, we all creeps
[?] to L'amour east, we all beasts
Smoke PCP, kids got stabbed over graffiti beef
Gra-gra-gra-gra-gra-graffiti beef [2x]
(look at me motherfucker when I'm talking)

[Verse 3: Ill Bill]
Double L train Canarsie, fit tags, drippy markers
Albee Square, Colosseum, 50 deep in king’s plaza
Flat leavers, crack slingers, cap peelers, rap singers
Blasted Desert Eagles, turning tracks forever ether
While the warplanes scatter nukes
[?] splatter goons
Sauteed magic shrooms, more strange antics soon
Blasting Paid in full, Dog Day Afternoon
Had to pay my dues, fought James after school
I snuffed John Hayes in front of Captain Video
Next, to the Arch Diner, Joey Haskell was with me too
That was before the gunplay and dapper dan jackets
Bootleg Timbaland leathers and automatic ratchets
Before Artie Audelino blew his face off
Playin Russian roulette after he vacuumed up a 8-ball
From childhood to manhood in King’s County
From my hood to yours we represent it proudly
Represent New York, represent Rowdy
Represent my whole crew, represent Howie
