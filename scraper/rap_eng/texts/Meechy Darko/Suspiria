[Verse 1: Juice]
I'm with a MILF as juicy Diana Ross
Blowing kush, eyes lazy, you know the boss
I'm so zombie, bitch get off me
Addicted to the game in my lane I'm bossy
My soul blue, my blood red
This is real life, I'm all good
The greed, the money, the girls, the drugs
The lies they bitching, the snakes, the frauds
They move backwards, set the flame to these actors
Lose my cool to these fools, never that I'm on the axis
High rolling, high learning, I be floatin'
Meditating with my tongue out, pimp game swollen
Y'all ain't on my level
Got a shooter, blunt roller, white girl and a cougar
You guys(?) you rap, it's all gravy
Juicy, that nigga so wavy

[Hook]
Hold up--Zombie
So why you frontin'?
Told you I'm a zombie
Come here and find me

[Verse 2: Meech]
I pop a tab and roll the weed, yes
Then play Russian roulette with three techs
And laugh as I cheat death
I ain't really see defeat yet
I roll that sour dies with ease yes
Then close my eyes, flip that lighter and take a deep breath
A bad bitch in the vacant room
A eighth of shrooms, picture me jumping the broom
Cameras zoom on the poon, I'm just trying to gape(?) a womb
Got bitches by the dozen, think I need a whole platoon
The weed purple, ejaculate then I'm outie
Four circles, flat blunt to that Maui Wowie
I give her dick so good, she scream "I don't deserve you"
Then she squirt-squirt on a nigga like some perfume
Her body is a temple, I guess it's safe to pray
Before I eat the pussy, make sure to say the grace
But she don't know that, I'm really really a cold nigga (frigid)
And all I got is golden showers for these gold diggers

[Hook]
Hold up--Zombie
So why you frontin'?
Told you I'm a zombie
Come here and find me

[Verse 3: Erick Arc Elliott]
The blunt bachelor, packed with hella green
In the fronto(?), they call me tonto with my regime
Negrodamus, graduated honors to that high grade
80s baby, but we don't wanna see your high fade
Fill your tank, road trip, zombies moving rank to rank
Brooklyn shit, just respect it(?) bitch and blow this danky dank
I thought you heard, don't deserve to bring your girl by us
World's flyest, now I'm watching all your girls try us
So my story blood, it's (?) came to life
It wasn't new pussy, somehow I made it right
Four Gs of OG, her-on how my fro be
Arc is the codeine(co-de?), bizarre how my flow be (I feel good)
Play my vinyl, move bitch, lie down
Room full of goons cause the parties never die down
Listening to Shaka, open up your chakra
I lick her proper homie, spiritual docta
