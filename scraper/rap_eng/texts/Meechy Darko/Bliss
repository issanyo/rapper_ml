[Verse 1: Erick Arc Elliot]
I blink twice 'til my eyes close on my face
Deep breaths, struggling to reach home base
Awkward nigga, motherfucker, this is a race
God made me great, so I been invisible to hate
Partly humane, part of the same, part of the game
Used to smoke a Parliament before I partied with my pain
And Bacardi was the same, 151 to your brain
But I'd rather beg my pardon than to party with you lames

[Chorus: Meechy Darko]
Fuck money, fuck friends, fuck family
Fuck pussy, fuck drugs, fuck sanity
I don't give a shit, why?
'Cause ignorance is bliss, right
Fuck the law, fuck the president and White House
Fuck the jury, fuck the judge in the nightgown
I don't give a shit, why?
'Cause ignorance is bliss, right

[Verse 2: Zombie Juice]
Sit back and analyze my life like Montana did white
All the bitches I hit, and all the bitches I might
Clearly underrated amongst all the favorite
But fuck it, my style's like Magic Speed Seduction
I'ma keep smoking 'til my lungs collapse
And fuck y'all laws, I'ma keep my straps
Setting the plans, controlling mine and reaching the land
I'm better off dead, somebody fill my head up with lead
Dropped out of high school, lint in my pocket
I picked up the profit, the block bitching, bitches is hawking
Grandma don't want me, Grandpa kinda lonely
Pay my dues, wear my jewels, refuse, never I lose
But fuck that, on my last dollar and my bus pass
Fucking with some niggas that'll give a mother fuck
Who fucking with us? No one fucking with us, time to reconsider
Zombie gang, walking dead, none iller

[Chorus: Meechy Darko]
Fuck money, fuck friends, fuck family
Fuck pussy, fuck drugs, fuck sanity
I don't give a shit, why?
'Cause ignorance is bliss, right
Fuck the law, fuck the president and White House
Fuck the jury, fuck the judge in the nightgown
I don't give a shit, why?
'Cause ignorance is bliss, right

[Verse 3: Meechy Darko]
Fuck your faculty, your fans, and your music
Fuck the engineer and the nigga that produced it
Fuck your religion, your god, and your guidance
Tell Virgin Mary time for Meech to pop that hymen
Fuck the moon, fuck the stars, fuck Venus and Mars
Fuck a Rolex and diamond ring with them flashy cars
Fuck the last supper, fuck your church and its gospel
Fuck them halfway dead niggas in the hospital
Fuck my left lung, fuck my right lung
Fuck my chrome gun, fuck my black gun
Fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck
Drop five bombs, fuck that I'm on
Like the mic I record with, fuck global warming
Fuck heaven and hell, purgatory
Fuck the pastor, fuck you for giving him offering
Fucking exhausted from all these fucks
I'm fucking off this nigga, what the fuck

[Chorus: Meechy Darko]
Fuck money, fuck friends, fuck family
Fuck pussy, fuck drugs, fuck sanity
I don't give a shit, why?
'Cause ignorance is bliss, right
Fuck the law, fuck the president and White House
Fuck the jury, fuck the judge in the nightgown
I don't give a shit, why?
'Cause ignorance is bliss, right
