[ Hook ]
Aye, aye, aye
Niggas snakes
Niggas snakes
Y’all were just a bunch of fakes
Y’all were just the mistakes
Grindin on the track
305 till the day I die
MoneyG4NG all the way
I don’t have nothing to say
Talking the shit about me so
Leave my life and have a nice day, aye
Nigga snakes
Nigga snakes
You was just fake
Talking shit about me but yo girl got some cake
I’m always come back
I’m feeling like Tron in the survival
Throwing that disk like I’m ducking
While the disk hits you, get deleted, yo girl sucking on my dick
Umm bitch who you fucking

[ Verse ]
Nanoo
Yea I’m talking about theses snakes
Turning their backs
Coming on the tracks
Telling me that I’m wack
You can’t say it to my face
You really trying to keep up with the pace
Really gonna catch a case
Everyone wanna know what’s the hate
Can you say a few words with a little fate
Can’t speak it daily
We use to be bros
I may or may not talk about you
Champagnepapi like isn’t that Drake
Whoa, I know what’s that take
Wearing these kicks
Female calling me papi
Drifting away in the Maserati
You can come to my face and say your sorry like

[ Hook ]
Aye, aye

Y’all were just a bunch of fakes

Leave my life and have a nice day, aye

Umm bitch who you fucking
